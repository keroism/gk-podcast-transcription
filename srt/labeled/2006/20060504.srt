1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,883
Rym: It's Thursday May 4th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:12,923 --> 00:00:14,809
Rym: We tell tales of injury and disease.

3
00:00:16,471 --> 00:00:17,487
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:18,671 --> 00:00:23,850
Rym: So everyone who knows me knows that I have this stupid bucket hat that I wear every now and then.

5
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:30,205
Rym: Yeah, whenever I need a hat to put on whenever I don't feel like combing my hair.

6
00:00:30,225 --> 00:00:31,830
Rym: I put on this green bucket hat.

7
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,517
Rym: I've had it for a long long time.

8
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:34,220
Scott: It's messages.

9
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,730
Scott: It's like a useless piece of just cloth.

10
00:00:37,314 --> 00:00:37,918
Rym: I like it now.

11
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,630
Rym: In fact, it's my second stupid hat.

12
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:47,329
Rym: I replaced the previous stupid hat that I'd worn all through high school and then someone stole from me during orientation at RIT.

13
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,840
Rym: Yeah, someone actually stole it.

14
00:00:50,603 --> 00:00:53,440
Scott: I wore many different hats Over the years.

15
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,713
Scott: I mean in elementary school I had like a hat with some basketball team on it and then in middle school I had some.

16
00:00:59,814 --> 00:01:06,349
Scott: I didn't think I had a hat in middle school because they didn't allow you to wear a hat in middle school But then oh they didn't let us either but I wore him outside of school all the time.

17
00:01:06,835 --> 00:01:13,269
Scott: Yeah, then in high school I got the the Mets hat and then I kept that to college and then around freshman year just stopped wearing it.

18
00:01:14,013 --> 00:01:20,422
Rym: See, I don't like wearing hats with stuff on them and for the longest time I eventually found a black baseball cap with no logo or anything on it.

19
00:01:20,483 --> 00:01:22,489
Rym: It's just a black baseball cap with a gray brim.

20
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,178
Scott: Mmm, see was all about.

21
00:01:25,198 --> 00:01:36,730
Scott: I used to wear the hats that had the Adjustable size in the back and then I discovered the fitted hat and that's when I was able to wear it for extended periods of Time because the one of the adjustable size is not comfortable at all.

22
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,810
Rym: Well, it depends if you get the crappy one with those plastic nubs that fit into the other plastic holes.

23
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,315
Rym: That's crap.

24
00:01:41,396 --> 00:01:42,690
Scott: That's the crap what I'm talking about.

25
00:01:42,872 --> 00:01:49,290
Rym: No, no, see my head is adjustable But it's nice because instead of that it has a leather strap in the back that you can adjust to any size.

26
00:01:49,872 --> 00:01:52,445
Scott: Yeah, it's a little better, but it's still not as good as the hat.

27
00:01:52,485 --> 00:01:53,350
Scott: That is your size.

28
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:56,290
Rym: That's really comfortable and I can adjust it depending on my hair.

29
00:01:57,953 --> 00:02:00,630
Rym: The size of my hair determines how big my head is in any given day.

30
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,740
Scott: Yeah Anyway, my hair is always the same size.

31
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:07,050
Rym: Anyway, I've had this hat for a long time.

32
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,820
Rym: It is a very fairly iconic hat of Rym.

33
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:12,670
Rym: I'm often wearing it, you know at the beach or when I'm a bum.

34
00:02:13,771 --> 00:02:17,530
Rym: The other day I was running along the railroad tracks and I was hot.

35
00:02:17,691 --> 00:02:24,001
Rym: I was wearing my hat so I took it off and I put in my pocket and I kept running Somewhere along a span of at least four miles.

36
00:02:24,182 --> 00:02:27,193
Rym: it fell out of my pocket and I don't know where Mm-hmm.

37
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:28,637
Rym: I'm rather miffed at this.

38
00:02:28,998 --> 00:02:36,110
Rym: In fact, I ran back along the railroad tracks today to try and find it and It wasn't there at least in the span that I ran in.

39
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:43,772
Rym: So if there's a decent chance that someone took my stupid hat off the railroad tracks on the ground and did something with it Mm-hmm.

40
00:02:44,093 --> 00:02:45,257
Rym: I don't think an animal took it.

41
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:46,983
Rym: There's no trains.

42
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,399
Scott: I Don't know why I don't want your stupid hat.

43
00:02:50,621 --> 00:02:52,029
Rym: Yeah, it's kind of raggedy and old.

44
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:53,558
Scott: It's not even a hat.

45
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:58,941
Scott: you if I leave you saw it lying there you'd say hey There's some tattered piece of material wasn't that tattered?

46
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,650
Scott: wasn't tattered but it just kind of flumpy.

47
00:03:02,434 --> 00:03:04,264
Rym: Oh, well, at least I'll just buy a new one.

48
00:03:04,747 --> 00:03:07,919
Scott: Yeah, I Don't know where you're gonna find such a useless hat.

49
00:03:08,824 --> 00:03:09,850
Rym: They sell them all over the place.

50
00:03:09,991 --> 00:03:13,210
Rym: I bought that for like eight dollars at Kmart when I was in high school.

51
00:03:13,732 --> 00:03:14,153
Scott: Awesome.

52
00:03:14,254 --> 00:03:14,836
Scott: Kmart.

53
00:03:15,378 --> 00:03:17,465
Scott: Kmart doesn't really exist that much anymore.

54
00:03:17,485 --> 00:03:22,963
Rym: I mean there's one over there, but That's about it, yeah, but out in the Midwest there's still a lot of them.

55
00:03:23,665 --> 00:03:23,987
Scott: Yeah.

56
00:03:24,448 --> 00:03:27,076
Scott: Yeah Well, we're not going to the Midwest.

57
00:03:27,136 --> 00:03:27,417
Scott: Are we?

58
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,746
Scott: Yeah, when's the last time you're in the Midwest?

59
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:31,452
Rym: Uh, I think it was.

60
00:03:31,472 --> 00:03:33,723
Rym: they said which was when while ago.

61
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,310
Scott: Yeah long time ago.

62
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,881
Rym: Maybe I'll fly out there when I visit my dad and I'll buy a hat.

63
00:03:38,202 --> 00:03:40,010
Rym: Yeah, I need a goddamn head.

64
00:03:40,171 --> 00:03:42,404
Scott: I'm fine in Detroit cuz I need to buy me a hat.

65
00:03:42,585 --> 00:03:43,470
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

66
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,137
Rym: I'll go to that leather shop to buy new boots.

67
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,643
Scott: That's a good idea.

68
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:48,230
Rym: Yeah, actually my boots are fine.

69
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,296
Rym: I just have to take care of them.

70
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:51,749
Rym: If you can't tell we're stalling cuz we don't have so much good news.

71
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,075
Scott: There's not much to talk about.

72
00:03:54,156 --> 00:03:54,718
Scott: We're bored.

73
00:03:54,758 --> 00:03:55,922
Scott: We're tired.

74
00:03:55,982 --> 00:03:56,544
Rym: You're tired.

75
00:03:56,584 --> 00:03:57,106
Rym: I'm fine.

76
00:03:57,126 --> 00:03:58,270
Rym: I don't know what's wrong with you.

77
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:58,692
Scott: What do you mean?

78
00:03:58,712 --> 00:03:59,234
Scott: what's wrong with me?

79
00:03:59,274 --> 00:04:00,721
Scott: How many times are you all tired?

80
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:02,048
Scott: And I'm like, what's wrong with you?

81
00:04:02,068 --> 00:04:02,490
Rym: Never.

82
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:03,963
Scott: Many times.

83
00:04:04,045 --> 00:04:04,228
Scott: When?

84
00:04:05,751 --> 00:04:05,992
Scott: When?

85
00:04:06,052 --> 00:04:06,957
Scott: Many many times.

86
00:04:06,977 --> 00:04:07,681
Rym: Name one time.

87
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:08,927
Scott: Last week.

88
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:09,410
Rym: When?

89
00:04:10,335 --> 00:04:10,688
Rym: What day?

90
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:12,252
Scott: Some day.

91
00:04:12,512 --> 00:04:13,436
Rym: Nah, that's not good time.

92
00:04:13,456 --> 00:04:15,543
Scott: Just cuz I can't name a specific day doesn't mean it didn't happen.

93
00:04:15,563 --> 00:04:19,015
Rym: I got a specific one right now with Scott You suck.

94
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:24,361
Rym: Anyway, in the news Alright blu-ray DVD.

95
00:04:24,442 --> 00:04:25,610
Rym: Well god blu-ray.

96
00:04:26,192 --> 00:04:33,869
Rym: Here's my prediction that blu-ray is going to fail solely because even just now not intentionally I said blu-ray DVD instead of just blu-ray.

97
00:04:34,653 --> 00:04:35,877
Rym: Yeah, the name is blu-ray.

98
00:04:35,897 --> 00:04:36,399
Rym: That's it.

99
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,141
Rym: Mm-hmm.

100
00:04:37,182 --> 00:04:38,105
Rym: Not blu-ray disc.

101
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:39,189
Rym: Not blu-ray just blu-ray.

102
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,807
Rym: But DVD is one of those words like mp3.

103
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:47,450
Rym: This just seems it seems to have infiltrated the consciousness of even non geeks.

104
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:51,426
Rym: I mean how many people when they want, you know music on their computer?

105
00:04:51,446 --> 00:04:51,908
Rym: They say mp3.

106
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:55,561
Rym: They don't know that mp3 is a format of a file.

107
00:04:55,822 --> 00:04:57,990
Rym: They think mp3 means sound on a computer.

108
00:04:58,572 --> 00:05:00,980
Scott: Yeah, they might be getting AACs and WMAs.

109
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,522
Scott: They don't know.

110
00:05:01,903 --> 00:05:03,730
Scott: Yeah or a tracks.

111
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:09,369
Rym: But anyway blu-ray DVD was delayed again.

112
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:14,610
Rym: Wow, and now it's going to come out in the end of middle end of June.

113
00:05:15,354 --> 00:05:17,846
Rym: And it wasn't delayed for any technical reason as far as I can tell.

114
00:05:17,906 --> 00:05:36,810
Rym: it was delayed because the players aren't coming out until June and Sony entertainment wanted to release their discs the blu-ray discs the blu-ray DVDs in May Which is just fantastic, you know have discs for sale that there's no player in the world that can play them.

115
00:05:37,432 --> 00:05:51,684
Scott: well, I think the idea of that is you put the discs on store shelves and People can either a buy the discs in anticipation of buying the player or B get comfortable with the fact that okay, these discs are available.

116
00:05:51,804 --> 00:05:53,610
Scott: and then you know get the player.

117
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,570
Scott: You don't go buying a DVD player when there's no DVDs in the store.

118
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:00,069
Scott: You have to have the DVDs in the store first, then people will buy the player.

119
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:00,892
Rym: All right.

120
00:06:00,952 --> 00:06:15,369
Rym: point to point the first the 12 or so movies that are being released on blu-ray first are Either of their one of two categories Unmitigated crap or Movies that in no way will benefit from being on an HD format

121
00:06:15,932 --> 00:06:16,656
Scott: Naha

122
00:06:16,736 --> 00:06:19,209
Rym: movies that really didn't benefit much from being on DVD.

123
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:23,582
Scott: Well, if the movies weren't made in HD really then it doesn't really.

124
00:06:23,602 --> 00:06:29,845
Rym: I don't think there are many people out there Who can really tell the difference between a DVD and an HD blu-ray DVD?

125
00:06:31,912 --> 00:06:37,339
Scott: I can tell the difference on the same television as As long as you know, it's a good.

126
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,890
Rym: it has to be a power a good HD television.

127
00:06:40,211 --> 00:06:41,356
Rym: Yeah, I mean our TV.

128
00:06:41,376 --> 00:06:43,263
Rym: There's no way to tell because our TV is just not that good.

129
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:44,648
Scott: Our TV is not HD at all.

130
00:06:45,911 --> 00:06:48,483
Rym: However, HD TVs are very very expensive.

131
00:06:48,523 --> 00:06:49,930
Rym: compared to normal TVs.

132
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:54,425
Scott: You can get some smaller ones now, but it still is America.

133
00:06:54,505 --> 00:06:55,789
Rym: You expect someone to buy a small TV.

134
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,398
Rym: Relatively how many people do you see they have?

135
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,890
Scott: you can get a 36 inch HD TV nowadays?

136
00:07:01,271 --> 00:07:02,456
Rym: Yeah for quite a bit of money.

137
00:07:02,476 --> 00:07:06,150
Scott: compared to what we pay a couple hundred dollars more than a non HD equivalent.

138
00:07:06,271 --> 00:07:09,509
Rym: That's quite a bit of money for very little actual difference.

139
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:11,796
Scott: Yeah, but that's 720p.

140
00:07:11,836 --> 00:07:17,215
Rym: if you can get something to go to 1080p then then it's a lot more money for still not that much Of a difference.

141
00:07:17,658 --> 00:07:19,330
Scott: It's a pretty big difference if it's utilized.

142
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:19,651
Scott: It's.

143
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:29,145
Scott: the problem is not too many things utilize the HD to the fullest because it's hard to utilize No kidding, and it's also expensive to utilize and in many cases.

144
00:07:29,205 --> 00:07:29,586
Rym: It's not.

145
00:07:29,646 --> 00:07:30,710
Rym: it doesn't really add anything.

146
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,726
Scott: A lot of times it takes away things.

147
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:39,287
Rym: Yep I mean unless you've got an Xbox 360 and even then most of the games aren't actually HD.

148
00:07:39,307 --> 00:07:40,210
Rym: They're just up sampled.

149
00:07:40,514 --> 00:07:41,508
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

150
00:07:42,031 --> 00:07:50,078
Rym: But anyway, the reason they really delayed it was that all the retailers and the people and the other studios said hey You can't release those discs so soon.

151
00:07:50,118 --> 00:07:57,933
Rym: We don't want to have these stuck with these things on our shelves with a month of no one buying them release them later and Sony said crap.

152
00:07:58,415 --> 00:08:04,240
Rym: and they had these negotiations and the good negotiations broke down, and then Sony said all right fine We'll delay everything.

153
00:08:04,705 --> 00:08:08,097
Rym: God Mm-hmm once again.

154
00:08:08,117 --> 00:08:10,390
Rym: I predict that blu-ray is going to be a miserable failure.

155
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,326
Scott: HD DVD also even.

156
00:08:12,346 --> 00:08:18,164
Rym: oh yeah I'm not even going to be started on HD DVD But I think it has a slight edge in that it has the letters DVD in it.

157
00:08:18,184 --> 00:08:20,172
Scott: well everyone knew it had that edge from The beginning.

158
00:08:20,874 --> 00:08:21,697
Rym: that's the only edge.

159
00:08:22,138 --> 00:08:25,730
Scott: Yeah, I don't know well the blu-ray was really banking on.

160
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:31,389
Rym: You know people buying ps3s that who I want the game system, but it's also a blu-ray player whoo.

161
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,259
Rym: But ps3 is not looking so hot right now either.

162
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:37,210
Scott: I have a feeling they're both going to become another mini disk whatever.

163
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:51,486
Scott: yeah, unless the computer drives can drop in price quick enough to make HD DVDs or blu-rays useful for data or Unless porn studios can start putting out HD porn in high quality studios.

164
00:08:51,526 --> 00:08:52,670
Rym: Don't want HD porn?

165
00:08:53,111 --> 00:08:59,350
Rym: Yeah, you realize most porn is shot with a soft focus because if you have really good clarity it just looks disgusting.

166
00:09:01,152 --> 00:09:03,219
Rym: Yeah, yeah porn is very little.

167
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:06,269
Rym: the porn industry has very little interest in HD formats at this time.

168
00:09:07,233 --> 00:09:09,843
Rym: There have actually been a couple articles on FARC about that recently.

169
00:09:09,863 --> 00:09:10,726
Rym: awesome.

170
00:09:10,826 --> 00:09:11,810
Scott: That means it's gonna fail.

171
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,697
Scott: You don't have porn your technology can't win.

172
00:09:13,858 --> 00:09:20,490
Rym: yeah for anyone out there who doesn't know and we're not kidding We're not just saying this that you can verify this from respected sources.

173
00:09:21,011 --> 00:09:30,261
Rym: The primary driving force in consumer home entertainment technology and theater technology for the past 50 years has been pornography.

174
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:35,064
Scott: if your technology Doesn't have pornography in some way.

175
00:09:35,646 --> 00:09:36,450
Scott: It's going to fail.

176
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:37,694
Rym: We're not even kidding.

177
00:09:38,136 --> 00:09:46,758
Scott: look Atari Custer's revenge any yes had those strip poker games DOS their porn games for DOS.

178
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:50,390
Rym: the first applications of VHS were mostly pornography.

179
00:09:51,295 --> 00:09:52,322
Scott: It's all porn.

180
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,093
Scott: porn drives Information technology.

181
00:09:55,193 --> 00:09:58,182
Rym: now the number two drive is actually military research.

182
00:09:58,703 --> 00:09:58,904
Scott: Yep.

183
00:09:59,325 --> 00:10:01,010
Rym: There's really almost nothing after that.

184
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,194
Rym: No one cares about the market.

185
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:03,678
Rym: the market comes after the porn.

186
00:10:04,461 --> 00:10:08,682
Scott: if your technology does not have any violence or sex It's not gonna make it.

187
00:10:09,812 --> 00:10:13,188
Scott: HD DVD doesn't have in blu-ray don't have violence or sex.

188
00:10:13,892 --> 00:10:14,634
Scott: I think the screwed.

189
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:31,021
Rym: the main thing about blu-ray and all that that I'm thinking about more and more is that DVD was such a huge leap over VHS and At that time computer technology was nowhere near the capability of playing those kinds of movies Just on a computer without any sort of physical media.

190
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:32,467
Rym: It's true now.

191
00:10:32,487 --> 00:10:33,210
Rym: We're beyond that.

192
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:40,709
Rym: We're getting to the point where you could give people just data files It doesn't matter what the format is and they could play them on a computer or some intelligent device.

193
00:10:41,393 --> 00:10:51,332
Rym: By locking into a format like blu-ray or HD DVD You're just locking yourself into something that's gonna be obsolete and crappy within a few years Mm-hmm.

194
00:10:51,855 --> 00:10:59,470
Scott: That's the idea is that they want to make money by selling you the same movie Ten or fifteen times out of the course of your life as you switch from one media to the next.

195
00:10:59,591 --> 00:11:02,250
Rym: Yeah, you know what the best movie that's gonna be released on blu-ray is.

196
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:06,780
Rym: Fifth fucking element really of the list.

197
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,004
Rym: That was the only movie that.

198
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,690
Rym: those are just the launch titles.

199
00:11:09,911 --> 00:11:12,701
Rym: Yeah, but the fifth element doesn't need HD.

200
00:11:12,721 --> 00:11:13,765
Rym: You're not gonna get anything.

201
00:11:13,805 --> 00:11:15,090
Scott: It wasn't filmed really in HD.

202
00:11:15,856 --> 00:11:19,954
Rym: She's not gonna say multi-pass better Multipass.

203
00:11:20,115 --> 00:11:21,325
Rym: it's one of my favorite movies ever.

204
00:11:21,587 --> 00:11:27,970
Scott: It's alright Great, so that oblivion game that everyone's playing that I'm not really interested in at all.

205
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:32,950
Rym: I'd be interested in it if it were better, but I like the idea of games like that.

206
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:39,471
Scott: Yeah actually When I found out the game wasn't like Baldur's gate where you have to click all the time and it's more like a first-person Thing.

207
00:11:39,512 --> 00:11:40,575
Scott: I was more interested in it.

208
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:41,779
Scott: It's just.

209
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:47,398
Scott: it still has you know, the same tedium sort of Me the I.

210
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:53,021
Rym: I like games like that, but I don't want him play him in a sandbox Single-player games of that magnitude.

211
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,010
Rym: I just I feel like I'm wasting my life playing them.

212
00:11:55,351 --> 00:11:58,887
Rym: Yeah, an MMO would be cool if it was like that.

213
00:11:58,967 --> 00:12:03,370
Rym: just freeform Crazy complex no balance whatsoever.

214
00:12:04,076 --> 00:12:07,190
Rym: Deal with it kind of world Mmm.

215
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,318
Rym: anyway, that's a whole other conversation.

216
00:12:09,338 --> 00:12:12,329
Scott: Yeah, so the game had a rating of T for team.

217
00:12:13,452 --> 00:12:14,539
Scott: I'd have never played the game.

218
00:12:14,619 --> 00:12:16,170
Scott: So I don't know if that's an accurate rating.

219
00:12:16,551 --> 00:12:19,801
Rym: Uh, mostly because when you hit someone they scream and bleed.

220
00:12:20,143 --> 00:12:21,226
Scott: so it's realistic.

221
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:22,490
Rym: It's pretty realistic.

222
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,336
Rym: It's as realistic as you'll get from a game like that.

223
00:12:24,357 --> 00:12:28,170
Scott: All right, the gay ESRB changed the rating to M.

224
00:12:28,795 --> 00:12:29,380
Rym: Now why?

225
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,388
Rym: oh, why did they do this?

226
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:38,578
Scott: Apparently they found some violence and such that they didn't know about before The violence wasn't really the main drive.

227
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:40,544
Scott: Yeah, actually most of it was the violence.

228
00:12:41,066 --> 00:12:43,735
Rym: the topper was the Topless model.

229
00:12:44,036 --> 00:12:44,980
Scott: there wasn't really top.

230
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,310
Scott: There isn't any toplessness in the game.

231
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,839
Scott: They just have a model.

232
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:54,184
Scott: but when the model appears in the game It's covered by underwears and on the Xbox 360 version.

233
00:12:54,204 --> 00:12:55,610
Scott: You can't possibly mod it.

234
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:58,216
Rym: This is the same as that hot coffee issue.

235
00:12:58,337 --> 00:12:58,998
Scott: No, it's not.

236
00:12:59,058 --> 00:13:05,170
Rym: it's slightly different Now because it is something that's in the game that you're not supposed to be able to access so it effectively isn't there.

237
00:13:05,672 --> 00:13:10,250
Scott: Yeah, but they're also changing the rating on the Xbox 360 version where you can't access it no matter what.

238
00:13:11,112 --> 00:13:12,950
Rym: Yeah, well because it's one game.

239
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:16,003
Rym: I don't know if they like the idea of having the same game have two different ratings.

240
00:13:16,786 --> 00:13:26,126
Scott: I don't know but The company that makes it Was like oh, we don't care do whatever you want change them change the stupid rating.

241
00:13:26,146 --> 00:13:27,049
Scott: We're not changing our game.

242
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:27,390
Scott: Fuck you.

243
00:13:27,871 --> 00:13:32,265
Rym: Yeah, if the ratings are really meaningless at this point parents ignore them or don't understand them.

244
00:13:32,325 --> 00:13:33,067
Rym: kids don't care.

245
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:33,990
Rym: stores don't care.

246
00:13:34,712 --> 00:13:39,850
Rym: I mean if the one EB won't sell the game do because it's rated M to a kid the game stop next door will.

247
00:13:40,271 --> 00:13:41,795
Scott: Well, actually it nowadays.

248
00:13:41,835 --> 00:13:46,990
Scott: I think I heard 70% or so of stores are actually selling by the ratings.

249
00:13:47,597 --> 00:13:48,569
Rym: Are they really though?

250
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:55,150
Rym: I mean remember most stores like that are staffed by one or two dudes who are younger than us just hanging out.

251
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:55,797
Rym: They don't care.

252
00:13:55,817 --> 00:14:03,017
Rym: Yeah If I were working in a game stop, I probably even think about the ratings Unless my manager was standing there.

253
00:14:03,037 --> 00:14:06,370
Scott: I definitely don't look at the ratings of games when I go to the store at all.

254
00:14:07,038 --> 00:14:09,498
Scott: You know when you go to the moon I don't even look at movie ratings anymore.

255
00:14:09,579 --> 00:14:13,879
Scott: used to when I was a kid and it kind of mattered but nowadays No, see the nice thing when I was a kid.

256
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:14,442
Rym: It didn't matter.

257
00:14:14,462 --> 00:14:15,950
Rym: the theater near us didn't care.

258
00:14:16,692 --> 00:14:18,146
Rym: Yeah, I just want to see our rated movies.

259
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:21,678
Scott: all the time Our theater acted like they cared but they really didn't.

260
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,483
Rym: our theater was like we don't care.

261
00:14:23,945 --> 00:14:24,968
Rym: They were pretty open about it.

262
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:27,384
Rym: Awesome I'll bet that's changed.

263
00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:36,000
Scott: The problem I see here is that the ESRB is getting bashed like really bashed because by all the evil Fucktards in the government.

264
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:49,162
Scott: and If they go around changing the ratings on games, that's sort of like saying yeah, we suck They should have just let it slide and no one would have made made a big deal about it And no one would have found out or continued to bash them.

265
00:14:49,564 --> 00:14:59,090
Scott: So it's like they're covering their ass Because they you know on an issue that they didn't really need to cover and thus Exposing that there was an issue to cover which no one knew about.

266
00:15:00,254 --> 00:15:04,940
Scott: You know, it's like if I had a gaping Hole in my armor and then I patch it up.

267
00:15:05,341 --> 00:15:05,803
Scott: someone goes.

268
00:15:06,104 --> 00:15:07,690
Scott: Oh, I didn't know you had a hole in your armor.

269
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:09,055
Scott: Oh, look at that.

270
00:15:09,095 --> 00:15:09,779
Scott: He had a hole in his.

271
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:10,804
Scott: they make shitty armor.

272
00:15:10,824 --> 00:15:12,834
Scott: That's what I thought You know.

273
00:15:12,854 --> 00:15:15,187
Scott: if you just let it slide no one would have noticed there was a hole.

274
00:15:15,227 --> 00:15:23,710
Rym: you'd be alright Alright, so my thing of the day.

275
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:28,350
Rym: I gotta give some props to laws on the forums for pointing this out to me.

276
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,259
Scott: I think laws stands for Legend of Zelda.

277
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:30,841
Scott: am I wrong?

278
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:32,570
Rym: Ah, that would make sense.

279
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:36,149
Scott: Yes, and I thought it stood for laws seems particularly cool and geeky.

280
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:45,180
Rym: but laws pointed out to us that there is this video online and It is definitely think of the day worthy and once I watched it It had to be.

281
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,390
Rym: I have to share this with the world.

282
00:15:46,831 --> 00:15:54,060
Rym: So anyone who doesn't go to the forums isn't gonna know what this is until I actually say it Holy crap kind of an incentive to hit the forums.

283
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,823
Rym: you get the scoop.

284
00:15:55,425 --> 00:15:59,570
Scott: Well, you get the scoop sometimes Yeah, most of the time you try to scoop us and you fail.

285
00:16:01,566 --> 00:16:09,690
Rym: Yeah Yeah, but anyway this thing is a. it's a video about Mario kicking some goombas butts and doing the whole flag thing.

286
00:16:10,691 --> 00:16:11,094
Scott: Great.

287
00:16:11,174 --> 00:16:12,906
Scott: We haven't seen that video a thousand times.

288
00:16:13,187 --> 00:16:19,237
Rym: However It's done in this very Soviet style propaganda.

289
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:19,779
Rym: awesome.

290
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:23,610
Rym: It even has Soviet music playing in the background from the Russian to the red of Russian choir.

291
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,775
Rym: It's awesome.

292
00:16:25,795 --> 00:16:32,945
Rym: I mean it ends with like Mario with his giant hammer Standing there and there's the flag and it's really cool.

293
00:16:33,286 --> 00:16:34,190
Scott: Yeah, it is really cool.

294
00:16:35,893 --> 00:16:39,643
Rym: The only gripe I have about it all is that in terms of the audio?

295
00:16:39,984 --> 00:16:47,850
Scott: They should have one used higher quality sound effects Mmm, they didn't use Mario sound effects, you know, like the sound effects they use were kind of annoying and loud.

296
00:16:47,912 --> 00:16:51,261
Rym: And you know The only reason they were annoying is because they were low quality the audio.

297
00:16:51,602 --> 00:16:54,071
Rym: if they had used those sound effects higher quality would have Been better.

298
00:16:54,091 --> 00:16:54,915
Rym: Mm-hmm.

299
00:16:54,935 --> 00:17:05,589
Rym: And if the sound effects have been a lot quieter and the music had been a lot louder They really didn't set up their Not to get an audio crap, but they didn't really set up their soundscape properly.

300
00:17:05,972 --> 00:17:09,549
Rym: So the sound effects was overpowering but you kept wanting to turn it up to hear the music.

301
00:17:10,371 --> 00:17:13,650
Rym: Yeah had to be the other way around but ignoring that it's awesome.

302
00:17:14,551 --> 00:17:23,371
Scott: It seems like it's something that's really old like I seen it before But I can't actually say aha that I did did see it before because I don't remember it and it was still awesome when I watched It.

303
00:17:23,471 --> 00:17:26,766
Rym: I think that's partly your desire to not have been scooped on something that cool.

304
00:17:27,048 --> 00:17:33,069
Scott: No, no It seems like you know, I can't tell when it was made, but I feel like I've seen something similar in the past.

305
00:17:33,613 --> 00:17:37,397
Rym: Uh-huh, maybe in a past life Dude, just let it go.

306
00:17:37,438 --> 00:17:38,101
Rym: You got scooped.

307
00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:39,066
Scott: Oh, really?

308
00:17:39,087 --> 00:17:39,469
Scott: I don't care.

309
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,378
Scott: So I found this other Mario thing.

310
00:17:43,398 --> 00:17:44,221
Scott: cuz what the hell.

311
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,926
Rym: wait, is this the thing I told you about?

312
00:17:46,347 --> 00:17:48,032
Rym: maybe that's fine The bullet bill thing.

313
00:17:48,093 --> 00:17:49,076
Rym: It's a bullet bill game.

314
00:17:49,277 --> 00:18:02,547
Scott: Yeah, it's a game where you're bullet bill and you have to smash Goombas and bricks and stuff But you can't hit the mushrooms in the ground or else you die And then you get shot out of the cannon again, and you have to do it again.

315
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:04,773
Rym: now This is the fun unique kind of game I like.

316
00:18:05,075 --> 00:18:08,574
Rym: I like games that put you in a cool situation like that Like I like.

317
00:18:08,595 --> 00:18:11,225
Rym: I'd like to see a flash game where you play all the bad guys against Zelda.

318
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:12,530
Scott: That'd be a good game.

319
00:18:12,651 --> 00:18:14,022
Rym: Yeah, we go to multiplayer game.

320
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:17,828
Rym: Yeah We should make that or someone out there should make it so I can play it.

321
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:22,910
Scott: Yeah, just make a mega man game, but you're a flash man or your metal man.

322
00:18:23,831 --> 00:18:29,008
Rym: Or make a mega man game where it's two-player and one guy controls each of the bad guys as it comes down and then controls the boss.

323
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,420
Scott: Yeah, it's alright.

324
00:18:31,763 --> 00:18:41,350
Rym: or make it like in Northversus south where you're walking your mega man and the other guy can has like a Limited number of enemies that they can drop down and control on you.

325
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,193
Scott: That was a good one.

326
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:42,975
Scott: north versa.

327
00:18:42,995 --> 00:18:47,630
Scott: if you haven't played north versus south for the for the NES you're missing out.

328
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,404
Scott: That's a great two-player game.

329
00:18:49,565 --> 00:18:53,783
Rym: Oh my god It's fairly terrible, but it's terrible in that awesome kind of terrible.

330
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,726
Scott: It's fantastic.

331
00:18:54,806 --> 00:18:55,770
Rym: It's got its issues.

332
00:18:56,453 --> 00:19:01,379
Scott: Basically, the only issue with it is once you build up the skills You're golden now.

333
00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:03,430
Rym: now the issue with it is that in the combat?

334
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:06,256
Scott: Oh the war Combat with the cannons and the horses.

335
00:19:06,296 --> 00:19:06,497
Scott: in the

336
00:19:06,557 --> 00:19:23,788
Rym: combat if you're if you play from a fully enlightened game theory Position where you make the ultimate move It'll often come down to the fact where it's a perfect stalemate and someone has to force themselves Someone basically has to quit and lose their army and there's no way for either team to actually kill the other team.

337
00:19:24,992 --> 00:19:27,510
Rym: The gates a perfect stalemate and whoever makes the first move loses.

338
00:19:27,631 --> 00:19:30,489
Rym: So you have no incentive to ever act and the game ends.

339
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,618
Scott: Well, you do have an incentive back to move your guys around.

340
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:35,390
Scott: so don't get canoned if the other guy has good cannon skills.

341
00:19:35,672 --> 00:19:37,523
Rym: No, because the cannon runs out after six shots.

342
00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:40,398
Scott: Oh Yeah, but then you can have multiple cannons.

343
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,488
Rym: No, yeah up to three and then they all run out.

344
00:19:43,191 --> 00:19:44,476
Rym: Hmm then what now?

345
00:19:44,536 --> 00:19:50,207
Rym: you've got that little bridge and you both got six dudes on either side and whoever walks Forward the other guy's gonna shoot and then win.

346
00:19:51,552 --> 00:19:52,580
Scott: Well, it depends.

347
00:19:52,782 --> 00:19:53,609
Rym: No, it doesn't depend.

348
00:19:53,951 --> 00:19:55,697
Rym: I played this game hundreds and hundreds.

349
00:19:55,738 --> 00:19:59,030
Scott: you send out your horsey guys all some of my gun guys and vice versa.

350
00:19:59,552 --> 00:20:01,260
Rym: Yeah, the horsey guys will probably just die.

351
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,530
Scott: Well, the horsey guys can win if they rush.

352
00:20:03,771 --> 00:20:07,243
Rym: No, they can't win if the player plays optimally on the other side.

353
00:20:07,504 --> 00:20:09,270
Rym: No, he just sits there with his gun guys.

354
00:20:09,611 --> 00:20:11,521
Rym: There's no reason for you to ever advance.

355
00:20:11,883 --> 00:20:13,090
Rym: if the horsies come you shoot them.

356
00:20:13,331 --> 00:20:14,256
Scott: You can fake the other guy.

357
00:20:14,276 --> 00:20:17,050
Scott: you said your horsey guys to make him move his guys.

358
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,490
Scott: And then you said you're out that you stop them and you move the other guys down.

359
00:20:19,711 --> 00:20:20,434
Rym: You can't stop them.

360
00:20:20,454 --> 00:20:22,424
Rym: They keep going they go right into the water and die.

361
00:20:23,047 --> 00:20:23,750
Scott: You can stop them?

362
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:24,412
Scott: No, you can.

363
00:20:25,075 --> 00:20:26,741
Rym: you cannot stop them once they go.

364
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:28,347
Rym: They whatever we're not.

365
00:20:28,447 --> 00:20:30,135
Scott: we're not talking about earth We're talking about bullet bill.

366
00:20:30,175 --> 00:20:31,763
Rym: Yeah, but don't don't talk about something.

367
00:20:31,803 --> 00:20:33,150
Scott: You don't know I know about it.

368
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:34,350
Scott: I played this game many times.

369
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:34,459
Scott: Yeah

370
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,693
Rym: and you know what if You play the game and

371
00:20:36,773 --> 00:20:47,890
Scott: the problem in the combat is that you have a lot of guys to control and you can only control One at a time and the cannons are really hard to control So if anyone is the cannon skill, it doesn't matter how big your army is you'll get owned.

372
00:20:48,071 --> 00:20:52,690
Rym: No, the cannon skill is useless because even if you play the cannon perfectly There's no way you'll hit anyone's stuff.

373
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:55,479
Rym: If they're they have even half a shit worth of skill.

374
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,629
Scott: if I get my cannon into middle your horsey guys guys You can't move the cannon forward.

375
00:21:01,212 --> 00:21:06,207
Scott: I can I can change the distance the cannon shoots and then I just move out of the way.

376
00:21:06,267 --> 00:21:08,850
Rym: the cannon ball takes a Long time to get to the other side of the screen.

377
00:21:09,172 --> 00:21:11,926
Rym: You can never ever ever lose any troop to a cannon.

378
00:21:11,966 --> 00:21:12,630
Rym: unless you're an idiot.

379
00:21:13,132 --> 00:21:14,577
Scott: You can lose a troop to a cannon.

380
00:21:14,617 --> 00:21:15,220
Rym: No, you can't.

381
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,725
Rym: you can only if you suck.

382
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:17,468
Scott: No.

383
00:21:17,488 --> 00:21:19,015
Rym: All right We'll play the game after this.

384
00:21:19,256 --> 00:21:20,703
Scott: All right, where are we gonna get this game?

385
00:21:20,824 --> 00:21:22,632
Rym: We've got it on the emulator All right.

386
00:21:22,672 --> 00:21:23,635
Scott: Well, let's go try to play it.

387
00:21:23,736 --> 00:21:24,699
Scott: Yeah, we'll see.

388
00:21:24,899 --> 00:21:25,802
Rym: play right after this.

389
00:21:26,224 --> 00:21:26,645
Scott: It's still.

390
00:21:26,705 --> 00:21:26,826
Scott: it's.

391
00:21:26,906 --> 00:21:27,990
Scott: it's a hard game to play.

392
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,115
Rym: I Mastered that game.

393
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:31,038
Scott: No, you didn't.

394
00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:31,741
Scott: Yeah, I did.

395
00:21:31,841 --> 00:21:32,444
Scott: Not at all.

396
00:21:32,464 --> 00:21:35,252
Rym: I played with my little brother constantly Whatever.

397
00:21:35,272 --> 00:21:36,598
Rym: all right, we'll see we'll see.

398
00:21:36,718 --> 00:21:38,305
Scott: we'll post anyways about bullet bill.

399
00:21:38,546 --> 00:21:39,410
Scott: bullet bills awesome.

400
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:43,370
Scott: They should make more games where you're a different character besides the main character.

401
00:21:43,491 --> 00:21:47,509
Rym: Yeah, the game does something really well and that if you die, it just immediately starts you over and you can try again.

402
00:21:48,192 --> 00:21:50,299
Scott: Yeah, and every time you beat a level you get a password.

403
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:57,894
Scott: because and that's a good thing because it's really really hard Like I. I don't know if maybe I just suck at this kind of game But I couldn't.

404
00:21:57,914 --> 00:21:59,098
Scott: I still beat level two.

405
00:21:59,239 --> 00:22:00,844
Scott: Well one - - I can't beat it.

406
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,710
Rym: Yeah, the game is really hard.

407
00:22:03,172 --> 00:22:06,230
Rym: It's the controls are really really really fickle.

408
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:14,550
Scott: I think what the game needs is to be a little slower in the Scrolling so that you can see far or wider so I can see farther ahead.

409
00:22:15,132 --> 00:22:19,791
Rym: It feels like it's going at about the speed that a bullet bill would have been going in Mario 1.

410
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,519
Scott: No bullet bills went slower than that.

411
00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:22,864
Rym: Not too much slower.

412
00:22:23,145 --> 00:22:24,210
Scott: Yeah, they went pretty slow.

413
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:26,901
Scott: This is going like a double or triple speed bullet bill.

414
00:22:27,424 --> 00:22:28,870
Rym: It's really just a memorization game.

415
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,429
Rym: Once you memorize a level you win.

416
00:22:31,411 --> 00:22:36,886
Scott: Yeah, but sometimes it's also a reflex game like I'll remember I have to go up but if I start pushing up too late It's over.

417
00:22:38,453 --> 00:22:49,926
Scott: It would be a good game to have an analog control for It's definitely a much better game where if you can watch someone play who knew what they were doing You get everything you need to get out of it pretty quickly and then you don't need it anymore.

418
00:22:50,127 --> 00:22:50,689
Scott: The game's done.

419
00:22:51,605 --> 00:22:59,333
Scott: Of course I really just want to beat one world because supposedly when you get to a - for level marin Luigi you're there and you try To hit them.

420
00:22:59,394 --> 00:23:03,780
Scott: So that's why I'm still playing just to see that once I see that I'll probably have no more reason to play.

421
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:17,070
Rym: if I made the game one I mean, it's gonna make it incredibly difficult like that did to actually get to the world x4 where you fight Mario - I'd set the game up with some sort of logic so that Mario would always dodge you no matter what

422
00:23:17,911 --> 00:23:18,554
Scott: That's a good one.

423
00:23:18,775 --> 00:23:21,789
Rym: That would be the most cruel horrible thing that could be done to a man.

424
00:23:22,593 --> 00:23:26,050
Scott: Or I'd make it a little more easy and more fun because the point of the game isn't to me.

425
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:33,255
Rym: I'd make it impossible because you know Because you know that instinct when you're playing a game and you get real close to beating it But you just can't beat it.

426
00:23:33,275 --> 00:23:35,828
Rym: You just keep playing it over and over and it's hard to stop until you win.

427
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,557
Rym: Sometimes you could you could get people to sit there.

428
00:23:39,657 --> 00:23:40,660
Rym: I almost got Mario.

429
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:42,144
Rym: Oh, I almost got him again.

430
00:23:42,164 --> 00:23:44,050
Rym: Oh, oh so close.

431
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:49,630
Rym: I'll stop as soon as I hit Mario, but you can't hit Mario because the logic of the game won't let you.

432
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:55,749
Scott: That's just dumb because then people would find out and post it on a forum somewhere and then no one would play.

433
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:57,299
Rym: no They wouldn't because they would not.

434
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,529
Rym: many people would even get that far.

435
00:23:59,092 --> 00:24:02,549
Scott: Anyway, the game also has really good music and sounds and such that it does.

436
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:07,650
Scott: Yep Play bullet bill until you get driven insane by it then don't play it anymore.

437
00:24:08,051 --> 00:24:12,503
Rym: Or just watch the Mario communist video over and over again a couple times is enough.

438
00:24:13,225 --> 00:24:15,070
Rym: Yeah, it'll get you real pumped up for communism.

439
00:24:16,253 --> 00:24:17,948
Scott: Just so we need more damn commies.

440
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,353
Scott: Communist bullet bills.

441
00:24:21,195 --> 00:24:21,555
Rym: Oh, yeah.

442
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:21,996
Rym: Yeah.

443
00:24:22,618 --> 00:24:22,899
Rym: All right.

444
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:27,048
Rym: So today's main bit was Scott's idea so you can introduce it.

445
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:32,144
Scott: Oh So it's really hard to come up with ideas for it to talk about on Thursday.

446
00:24:32,164 --> 00:24:33,670
Rym: Well now we have a lot of ideas.

447
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:39,470
Rym: We just they're ones that require research or an interview or stuff that we haven't got prepared, right?

448
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:44,766
Scott: So today we're gonna do a geek fable, but there's gonna be multiple fables, but they all the same.

449
00:24:44,847 --> 00:24:45,890
Scott: moral so doesn't matter.

450
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:52,273
Rym: Yeah, mostly this idea came from the fact that we get a lot of feedback that people really just like to hear us tell stories Yep.

451
00:24:52,815 --> 00:24:58,316
Scott: So today is geek fables of illness and Injury, we've got plenty.

452
00:24:58,817 --> 00:25:02,850
Scott: any fable having to do with illness or injury will be told today.

453
00:25:03,552 --> 00:25:06,844
Rym: So I'd like to start by saying that other than one pinky toe.

454
00:25:06,904 --> 00:25:08,450
Rym: I've never broken a bone in my body.

455
00:25:08,971 --> 00:25:13,466
Scott: I have only broken one bone in my body ever which one my collarbone.

00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:41,785
Rym: Oh, so it was just like a hairline fracture.

464
00:25:41,805 --> 00:25:42,770

Scott: Yeah, it must.

500
00:27:33,954 --> 00:27:39,291

Scott: Yeah It's not pleasant.

538
00:29:49,294 --> 00:29:51,602
Rym: I had a similar falling down the stairs incident.

539
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,352
Rym: This is probably the most serious injury I ever had.

540
00:29:54,372 --> 00:29:55,757
Scott: No, what about the bike spoke?

541
00:29:56,199 --> 00:29:57,704
Rym: Yeah, the bike spoke wasn't that serious.

542
00:29:57,824 --> 00:29:59,370
Scott: It's on the most serious to me.

543
00:29:59,611 --> 00:30:00,394
Scott: It wasn't serious.

544
00:30:00,434 --> 00:30:02,845
Rym: It wasn't life-threatening like the falling down the stairs.

545
00:30:02,865 --> 00:30:03,347
Rym: All right.

546
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:03,648
Scott: All right.

547
00:30:03,709 --> 00:30:03,950
Scott: All right.

548
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:06,839
Rym: Now everyone's get wondering what's the bike spoke?

549
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:07,783
Rym: That doesn't sound good.

550
00:30:07,803 --> 00:30:08,547
Scott: No, it doesn't.

551
00:30:08,567 --> 00:30:08,908
Rym: you know what?

552
00:30:08,948 --> 00:30:09,350
Rym: it isn't good?

553
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,621
Rym: No, I still got a mark on my leg.

554
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:11,609
Scott: It's really not good.

555
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:18,046
Rym: Yeah, but then I was a little kid because we had the same kind of stairway that Scott has, you know Except the landing was at the top.

556
00:30:19,313 --> 00:30:21,090
Rym: So you go like it was actually two landings.

557
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:32,870
Rym: Like you come out the hallway and you go down a few steps And then there's a landing and a door to this tiny little deck Like a tiny little deck that was like to a story up and it was really kind of useless.

558
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,397
Rym: My parents never let us play on it.

559
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,773
Scott: I wouldn't let you play on it dangerous They wouldn't like.

560
00:30:37,813 --> 00:30:43,296
Rym: we never even opened the door and it was like a normal steel door like the kind of Security door you'd have in your front door.

561
00:30:43,397 --> 00:30:45,144
Rym: Yeah, but it had a skeleton key.

562
00:30:45,184 --> 00:30:45,826
Rym: It was kind of cool.

563
00:30:45,907 --> 00:30:48,998
Rym: Mmm Marietta dream once where there's something there.

564
00:30:49,018 --> 00:30:49,941
Rym: Mm-hmm.

565
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:52,510
Rym: Yeah, like I opened the door and there's something there and it was cool.

566
00:30:53,411 --> 00:30:57,384
Rym: Anyway, then it goes down to another landing and then 90 degrees back.

567
00:30:57,425 --> 00:31:01,281
Rym: There's the long stairway down and I remember very specifically.

568
00:31:01,362 --> 00:31:02,310
Rym: I was eating snacks.

569
00:31:02,391 --> 00:31:06,018
Rym: I was eating cheese nips which were the same as cheese It's and I was eating Chex mix.

570
00:31:06,681 --> 00:31:08,470
Rym: and then I went upstairs and I was eating alphabets.

571
00:31:08,932 --> 00:31:11,022
Rym: Like I had three bowls of each and I was eating them all.

572
00:31:11,122 --> 00:31:12,810
Scott: three bowls of each nine bowls.

573
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:14,949
Rym: Well, I had one bowl of each a total of three balls.

574
00:31:15,352 --> 00:31:16,197
Scott: I'm like, what the hell.

575
00:31:16,257 --> 00:31:17,927
Rym: and for some reason I was eating all of them.

576
00:31:19,094 --> 00:31:20,230
Rym: All right, these three separate bowls.

577
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:28,262
Rym: I ran upstairs to do something and I was walking back downstairs and I missed a step and I rolled all the way down the stairs to the bottom.

578
00:31:28,282 --> 00:31:31,954
Rym: like but I'm put up but I'm put up whomp and I just laid there.

579
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:34,526
Rym: I don't know if I was knocked unconscious or what I was really young.

580
00:31:34,546 --> 00:31:36,233
Rym: Mm-hmm The next thing I know.

581
00:31:36,274 --> 00:31:38,864
Rym: there's paramedics standing around me and they're like, can you move your feet?

582
00:31:39,587 --> 00:31:42,114
Rym: and I was like no And they freaked out.

583
00:31:42,796 --> 00:31:53,559
Rym: they're like, oh my god, my parents are freaking out everyone's freaking out and I'm like, oh wait, yeah I don't remember much else other than that.

584
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,544
Rym: I'd wear a neck brace.

585
00:31:54,885 --> 00:31:55,227
Scott: Oh wait.

586
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:59,579
Scott: Yeah That's classic, can you move your feet?

587
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,182
Scott: No.

588

Scott: Oh my god.

589
00:32:01,406 --> 00:32:01,708
Scott: Oh wait.

590
00:32:01,728 --> 00:32:05,749
Rym: Yeah, I Think I was still a little delirious from the fact that I was knocked out.

591
00:32:06,293 --> 00:32:08,509
Scott: I think so, too, but that's all that's great.

592
00:32:09,251 --> 00:32:10,718
Rym: And partly I was scared to move it.

593
00:32:10,778 --> 00:32:14,213
Rym: cuz my I remember my mom yelling like don't move your neck It might be broken.

594
00:32:14,273 --> 00:32:16,099
Rym: and I was like what happens if it's bro.

Rym: I didn't understand what was going on But yeah, I was fine.

597
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:26,020
Rym: I just had to wear a neck brace for a long time At least a long time for a kid.

598
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,570
Scott: Did he get all itchy and whatnot?

607
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:58,065
Rym: Everyone lives to old age.

608

Rym: I always got the nurses See.

653
00:35:06,138 --> 00:35:14,087
Scott: at first it was nurses But apparently the only male doctor at RIT's health center at the time was a. what's the name of the doctor?

654
00:35:14,248 --> 00:35:14,970
Scott: orthopedic?

00:35:23,242 --> 00:35:23,383
Rym: Yeah.

661
00:35:23,464 --> 00:35:33,077
Scott: Anyway, anyway, I So he like looks at it and I'm like, yeah So it was a bruise and then it hurt less and then it hurt more and now it's hard to walk really hard to walk.

662
00:35:33,941 --> 00:35:43,650
Scott: and he's like, um And eventually after enough humming, he's like, alright, there might be a blood clot in your leg, which means bad stuff.

663
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,194
Rym: Yeah, you could die.

664
00:35:45,375 --> 00:35:50,189
Scott: Yeah, so he's like so I'm gonna send you to the hospital so they can look at it.

665
00:35:51,113 --> 00:35:51,736
Scott: I'm like great.

666
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,349
Scott: I go to the hospital and they ultrasound it and It's fine.

667
00:35:56,591 --> 00:36:03,461
Scott: and I waited at the hospital for a long time because a bunch of more injured people were there in front of me as Is with hospitals, of course.

668
00:36:03,683 --> 00:36:07,525
Scott: Yep so now it's late at night in the hospital and I need to get home.

669
00:36:07,585 --> 00:36:11,356
Scott: so I call a cab and There's a cab that will take that.

670
00:36:11,597 --> 00:36:15,070
Scott: if you're an RIT student, they'll just charge your RIT student account.

671
00:36:15,891 --> 00:36:16,836
Rym: Yeah, they don't help you out.

672
00:36:16,876 --> 00:36:18,001
Rym: If you're hurt at RIT.

673
00:36:18,202 --> 00:36:19,668
Rym: They just make it easy for you to pay.

674
00:36:19,728 --> 00:36:24,265
Scott: Yeah here Here's a free ride to the hospital in the RIT ambulance when you don't really need an ambulance.

675
00:36:24,626 --> 00:36:25,730
Scott: now get home on your own.

676
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:28,981
Rym: Bitch god, remember that drive Alex back from that hospital in the blizzard.

677
00:36:29,202 --> 00:36:30,547
Rym: Yeah, I'll tell that story.

678
00:36:30,567 --> 00:36:33,280
Scott: That's a good one But yeah, it's someone else's injury.

679
00:36:33,321 --> 00:36:34,850
Scott: We'll go with that route anyway.

680
00:36:35,931 --> 00:36:43,770
Scott: So I call a cab and this one cab service where if you get in their cab and you're an RIT student It's okay because they can charge your student account.

681
00:36:44,392 --> 00:36:49,830
Scott: I called that cab company, but apparently some other cab company came and I got in their cab.

682
00:36:50,031 --> 00:36:50,936
Scott: I don't know by accident.

683
00:36:51,036 --> 00:36:51,398
Scott: I don't know.

684
00:36:52,323 --> 00:36:53,610
Rym: I think they work some sort of scam.

685
00:36:53,894 --> 00:37:00,850
Scott: I don't know what it was But it was some sort of mix-up and I got in the wrong cab and they was like no you pay me cash now.

686
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,397
Scott: And I was like fuck luckily.

687
00:37:02,417 --> 00:37:13,370
Scott: I had enough cash, but I left my cell phone in his car And then I got home and I still was you know hurt to walk still but I need it still needed my cell phone back.

688
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:21,505
Scott: So Rym drove me to the cab company's office and I got my phone back And they went home and it just sucked all around.

689
00:37:21,525 --> 00:37:22,350
Scott: I didn't even get crutches.

690
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:27,447
Scott: I had to go back to the health center like the next day to get stupid crutches so I could fucking walk.

691
00:37:27,788 --> 00:37:28,612
Rym: now the injury There.

692
00:37:28,652 --> 00:37:29,785
Rym: that's not the best part of this.

693
00:37:31,112 --> 00:37:31,796
Scott: What was the best part?

694
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:32,520
Scott: Oh, right, right.

695
00:37:33,204 --> 00:37:34,270
Rym: You can't forget the fucking.

696
00:37:34,292 --> 00:37:35,986
Scott: Oh, yeah So the injury was just so.

697
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:36,330
Scott: you know.

698
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,850
Scott: The injury was like a pulled muscle that you know.

699
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:47,604
Scott: It was really pulled a lot and it just got re pulled at some point because I was walking on it and maybe it was caused by your Sedentary lifestyle.

700
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:54,457
Scott: No Anyway, anyway Later what happened?

701
00:37:54,638 --> 00:38:02,546
Scott: because I went to the campus health center Campus safety the security for the school came and knocked on my door and they're like were you injured recently?

702
00:38:02,586 --> 00:38:05,636
Scott: and I was like, oh, yeah What what do you think?

703
00:38:05,676 --> 00:38:06,540
Scott: someone beat me up?

704
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:09,290
Scott: You want me to turn them in when I don't even know how I get injured.

705
00:38:09,934 --> 00:38:12,069
Scott: They're like, oh are you in some sort of fight club?

706
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:15,629
Scott: Literally literally they're like are you in a fight club?

707
00:38:16,413 --> 00:38:20,730
Scott: And I almost was like, yeah me and everyone in this building we have a huge fight club.

708
00:38:21,752 --> 00:38:24,206
Scott: I was gonna make up a whole big sarcastic story, but I was just like.

709
00:38:24,226 --> 00:38:28,829
Scott: no This is gonna be hilarious when I tell everyone what you asked me.

710
00:38:30,852 --> 00:38:33,767
Scott: And now I'm making more out of that humor, yep

711
00:38:34,671 --> 00:38:45,640
Rym: so the best part is that later we wandered and we started googling, you know, like RIT fight club and we found two videos of Guys Beating the lever living shit out of it

712
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:48,410
Scott: upstairs deaf guys who wrestled with each other.

713
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:49,156
Rym: Oh, not even that.

714
00:38:49,176 --> 00:38:50,709
Rym: remember that video RIT fight club.

715
00:38:51,352 --> 00:38:55,626
Rym: Yeah, it was just about two country guys fighting with each other in a dorm at RIT.

716
00:38:55,646 --> 00:39:06,030
Scott: I Guess there are actually, you know not fight clubs like the movie But I guess people got together to fight in sort of friendly fights of some sort because they're stupid.

717
00:39:06,092 --> 00:39:06,668
Scott: I don't know.

718
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:13,087
Rym: well There was that time we were all behind Gracie's fighting with sticks and then well if a safety kendo is a little different than just stupid fighting.

719
00:39:13,589 --> 00:39:18,290
Scott: Yeah It's like if a guy goes to karate class, it's not the same as if he goes to fight club.

720
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:20,156
Rym: Yeah, but that wasn't kendo class.

721
00:39:20,196 --> 00:39:24,850
Rym: That was all of us trying to beat katsu to death with sticks and bailing at it.

722
00:39:25,111 --> 00:39:28,910
Scott: Yeah, I remember that time because I didn't really believe that anyone had magic ninja powers.

723
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:31,023
Scott: I'm like I can hit you with a fucking stick.

724
00:39:31,064 --> 00:39:32,090
Rym: who couldn't hit him with a stick?

725
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:32,754
Rym: None of us could.

726
00:39:32,814 --> 00:39:34,988
Scott: even we had even once we couldn't hit him with a steak.

727
00:39:35,892 --> 00:39:36,721
Scott: I was like, come on.

728
00:39:36,802 --> 00:39:37,610
Scott: I can hit you with a stick.

729
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:40,910
Scott: Especially we all go at you at once and no no we couldn't hit him.

730
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:43,470
Rym: He was just whirling around and he'd like poke us all with his stick.

731
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,300
Rym: Like I could have killed you all.

732
00:39:44,401 --> 00:39:45,170
Rym: I could have killed you all again.

733
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:48,445
Rym: I could have killed you all again and we're flailing at him as hard as we can.

734
00:39:48,505 --> 00:39:49,449
Rym: We couldn't do anything to him.

735
00:39:49,711 --> 00:39:50,637
Scott: No, not a thing.

736
00:39:50,798 --> 00:39:52,409
Scott: but I learned a lesson.

737
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:56,356
Scott: alright, so Injuries and illnesses.

738
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:58,565
Rym: Yeah, I can't hold the bicycle spoke any longer.

739
00:39:58,585 --> 00:39:59,749
Scott: All right, go for it.

740
00:40:00,292 --> 00:40:02,922
Rym: So I'm biking as I like to do.

741
00:40:03,264 --> 00:40:06,336
Rym: I used to mountain bike heavily I'm I still I bike constantly.

742
00:40:06,376 --> 00:40:06,978
Rym: I love biking.

743
00:40:07,621 --> 00:40:12,883
Rym: I've had the same bike for God 12 years now It looks like the most ragged falling apart.

744
00:40:12,903 --> 00:40:14,068
Rym: piece of crap, but it still works.

745
00:40:15,091 --> 00:40:17,562
Rym: Now one at one time I was riding and it wasn't.

746
00:40:17,622 --> 00:40:19,490
Rym: it was a cliff, but it wasn't a deep cliff.

747
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:25,996
Rym: It was like a trail through the woods and there's like a 15 or so foot drop off to the left of it And it's kind of a whiny trail.

748
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:29,630
Rym: I'm going and there's a stick kind of stuck in my front brake.

749
00:40:30,792 --> 00:40:37,619
Rym: So I lean forward while I'm riding, you know not really thinking and I grab this stick and I'm gonna rip it out of my brake so I can just keep going.

750
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:44,087
Rym: and Then I hit a rock or log or something and it pushed my hand into my spokes.

751
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:50,489
Rym: Oh Now instead of my wrist breaking though I still have a mark on my wrist for my hand went into the spoke.

752
00:40:51,051 --> 00:40:57,369
Rym: It just broke the spokes and flipped me over my handlebars and then I proceeded to fall down that 15 or so foot drop.

753
00:40:57,911 --> 00:41:00,078
Rym: Great and I landed in this bog area.

754
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,467
Rym: great now the spoke had broken.

755
00:41:02,607 --> 00:41:08,969
Rym: instead of my wrist Somehow I ended up with the spoke having been pushed mostly through my leg.

756
00:41:10,451 --> 00:41:11,916
Rym: Okay, I was laying there.

757
00:41:11,956 --> 00:41:13,641
Rym: I'm thinking I feel fine.

758
00:41:14,063 --> 00:41:16,250
Rym: My wrist hurts a little but it's not broken.

759
00:41:16,471 --> 00:41:17,956
Rym: So that's not so bad.

760
00:41:18,417 --> 00:41:22,130
Rym: and my leg really hurts and I look and I'm like nothing's wrong with it.

761
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,580
Rym: Wait a minute, and there's a spoke sticking out of it.

762
00:41:25,383 --> 00:41:30,449
Rym: I pulled the spoke out and there comes the blood And I thought well should I put the spoke back?

763
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:38,003
Rym: Now the thing was I was in the woods really nowhere near my house.

764
00:41:38,184 --> 00:41:40,010
Rym: I didn't have a cell phone or anything.

765
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:40,995
Rym: This is high school.

766
00:41:41,015 --> 00:41:45,154
Rym: I mean what we had a family cell phone back then But my parents weren't gonna.

767
00:41:45,174 --> 00:41:46,620
Rym: let me take that with me biking.

768
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,845
Rym: It was like it was huge.

769
00:41:47,865 --> 00:41:57,030
Rym: I'd lose it and expensive Yeah, so I ride my bike home and all the while I'm bleeding and my socks turning red and there's blood everywhere and I get home and I go into my house.

770
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:58,441
Rym: I'm like mom.

771
00:41:58,663 --> 00:42:02,198
Rym: I had a bike accident And she comes around.

772
00:42:02,238 --> 00:42:06,122
Rym: she's like well let me oh my god You're going to the hospital like what it's just it's not.

773
00:42:06,162 --> 00:42:06,986
Rym: it doesn't even hurt that much.

774
00:42:07,006 --> 00:42:16,210
Rym: like you're going to the hospital and I go to the doctor and I don't think it's so bad and I'm looking just a tiny little hole and Then he's like, well how deep is I'm like, I don't know.

775
00:42:17,071 --> 00:42:25,257
Rym: He's like hmm and he takes a q-tip and he's poking at it and I can't see because I'm laying on my stomach And he's like, how deep do you think that is?

776
00:42:25,558 --> 00:42:27,163
Rym: and I thought probably healed.

777
00:42:27,223 --> 00:42:29,550
Rym: it's probably only like a centimeter or two deep.

778
00:42:30,251 --> 00:42:33,590
Rym: He's like turn around and look at it and I look and you see his hand there.

779
00:42:34,053 --> 00:42:38,267
Rym: Then he pulls the q-tip all the way back out of my leg And he's like you're getting a stitch.

780
00:42:39,571 --> 00:42:40,214
Rym: I'm like one stitch.

781
00:42:40,254 --> 00:42:41,259
Rym: He's like, yeah, we're just one.

782
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:46,688
Rym: It's all you need and I got one stitch And I got this tiny little scar on my leg where there was one stitch.

783
00:42:47,191 --> 00:42:49,502
Scott: Of course, there's a giant gaping hole behind it.

784
00:42:49,924 --> 00:42:50,145
Rym: Yeah.

785
00:42:50,246 --> 00:42:55,545
Scott: Yeah, they put goop Cut you there and then we'll poke his q-tip down and say I'm sure it healed by now.

786
00:42:55,805 --> 00:42:59,279
Rym: Well, they will say Yeah, you put goop in there so I wouldn't get infected.

787
00:42:59,601 --> 00:43:01,670
Rym: Yeah, I think I had to get a tetanus shot.

788
00:43:02,291 --> 00:43:03,195
Scott: Yeah, you need one of those.

789
00:43:03,215 --> 00:43:06,490
Rym: Yeah, I got a tetanus shot before when I stepped on a rusty nail in the woods.

790
00:43:06,771 --> 00:43:08,645
Scott: This is one time I had tetanus, right?

791
00:43:08,906 --> 00:43:12,309
Rym: No, no Yeah, I had the bubonic AIDS.

792
00:43:12,778 --> 00:43:18,080
Rym: I Did have Lyme disease.

793
00:43:18,563 --> 00:43:19,650
Scott: you did have Lyme disease.

794
00:43:19,735 --> 00:43:27,272
Rym: Yeah Though I will preface that by saying that I spent my early years in Michigan in an area that is known as a hotbed of Lyme disease.

795
00:43:27,734 --> 00:43:31,989
Rym: Lyme disease isn't that common, but there are a few areas in the world where it is very concentrated.

796
00:43:32,732 --> 00:43:34,338
Scott: That's because there's a lot of fucking ticks.

797
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,530
Rym: I've lived in two of the top three tick infested areas.

798
00:43:38,251 --> 00:43:39,419
Scott: Ticks are nasty fuckers.

799
00:43:39,621 --> 00:43:39,842
Rym: Yeah.

800
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,950
Rym: No normal takes are fine.

801
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:43,687
Rym: I mean they bite you and they burrow in but you just set them on fire and rip them out.

802
00:43:43,707 --> 00:43:47,259
Rym: No big deal Yep, the ticks they give you Lyme disease are so small.

803
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:47,861
Rym: You won't see it.

804
00:43:47,901 --> 00:43:50,630
Rym: Well, they're dear to ya little bastard deer ticks.

805
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:51,734
Rym: They're tiny.

806
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,706
Rym: They're like the size of a period at the end of a sentence.

807
00:43:53,766 --> 00:43:54,450
Rym: They look like a mole.

808
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:55,199
Rym: You won't even notice them.

809
00:43:55,219 --> 00:43:56,070
Rym: They don't hurt or anything.

810
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:58,177
Scott: Yeah, you can't even tell that they're there unless you like.

811
00:43:58,639 --> 00:43:59,703
Scott: look for them on purpose.

812
00:44:00,064 --> 00:44:02,149
Scott: a magnifying glass is good for that Yep.

813
00:44:02,332 --> 00:44:10,509
Rym: So, I mean whenever I go into the woods I always have to take a shower and I stand there naked for about five minutes with a mirror Looking at all my bits making sure there's no ticks on them.

814
00:44:11,011 --> 00:44:15,809
Rym: It's a good idea because the worst thing is I didn't even know this until I got Lyme disease and I learned more about it.

815
00:44:16,252 --> 00:44:18,303
Rym: Those little bastards will get on your leg.

816
00:44:18,343 --> 00:44:22,530
Rym: They won't just bite your leg They'll crawl up your leg in your pants and then crawl over to your crotch.

817
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:23,756
Rym: There's a lot of hair to hide in there.

818
00:44:23,776 --> 00:44:25,082
Rym: where they you won't get you won't catch him.

819
00:44:25,624 --> 00:44:26,569
Rym: Oh, then they'll bite you.

820
00:44:26,589 --> 00:44:29,063
Scott: man I would never find a tick that got into my nut hair.

821
00:44:29,103 --> 00:44:30,270
Scott: He'd be totally lost.

822
00:44:30,792 --> 00:44:31,395
Scott: Be like, where do you?

823
00:44:31,415 --> 00:44:32,219
Scott: I didn't know he was there.

824
00:44:32,259 --> 00:44:38,424
Scott: there's no way I could have known he's hiding behind him Frickin forest of black and he's got a goddamn afro down there.

825
00:44:38,444 --> 00:44:39,267
Scott: Yeah, I do.

826
00:44:39,307 --> 00:44:44,905
Rym: I got a goddamn Pube bro, I keep myself nicely trimmed, but that's a conversation for another day.

827
00:44:44,925 --> 00:44:46,590
Scott: It is a conversation for another day.

828
00:44:47,011 --> 00:44:49,322
Rym: So I got this headache and whatever.

829
00:44:49,342 --> 00:44:50,085
Rym: I've had headaches before.

830
00:44:50,105 --> 00:44:51,070
Rym: I got sinus problems.

831
00:44:51,891 --> 00:44:56,187
Rym: The headache stayed for about a week and a half and it didn't get worse.

832
00:44:56,208 --> 00:44:56,870
Rym: that didn't get better.

833
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:58,456
Rym: Imagine just a constant headache.

834
00:44:59,179 --> 00:45:01,126
Scott: Uh, I don't really have headaches so often.

835
00:45:01,206 --> 00:45:02,270
Scott: So that's really yeah.

836
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:03,939
Rym: Like it wasn't like I was thinking.

837
00:45:03,959 --> 00:45:05,085
Rym: All right, this is weird.

838
00:45:05,105 --> 00:45:06,009
Rym: Am I sick?

839
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:08,435
Rym: Then I got a little fever.

840
00:45:08,857 --> 00:45:09,962
Rym: So I have a little fever and a headache.

841
00:45:10,183 --> 00:45:11,449
Rym: It's now been about two and a half weeks.

842
00:45:12,111 --> 00:45:18,370
Rym: Yeah, so I go to the doctor and the doctor's like you might have a brain tumor or something.

843
00:45:18,471 --> 00:45:19,928
Rym: We're gonna do a whole bunch of scans.

844
00:45:20,452 --> 00:45:24,650
Rym: Great, and I was like, okay and they do MRIs and all the cat scan.

845
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:26,096
Rym: They did a full-on cat scan.

846
00:45:26,357 --> 00:45:27,843
Rym: my insurance paid out the ass for this.

847
00:45:27,883 --> 00:45:29,710
Scott: It was doctors are so smart.

848
00:45:30,273 --> 00:45:30,916
Rym: They know these tests.

849
00:45:30,956 --> 00:45:36,339
Rym: he finds nothing and then after like five hours in the hospital He says take some aspirin get some rest.

850
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:36,982
Rym: You'll be fine.

851
00:45:37,202 --> 00:45:39,009
Rym: call back in two weeks if it doesn't get better.

852
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:48,250
Rym: Well, then I went to Wildwood, New Jersey and I was but the headache was so bad I couldn't even go like water skiing and all the fun tubing whatever on the boat that everyone else did.

853
00:45:49,571 --> 00:45:51,641
Rym: Instead I laid and that was a fun time.

854
00:45:51,681 --> 00:45:52,284
Scott: You missed out.

855
00:45:52,465 --> 00:45:53,088
Rym: I know I did.

856
00:45:53,794 --> 00:45:55,429
Rym: Instead I laid in the beach house going fuck.

857
00:45:58,782 --> 00:46:00,832
Rym: So then I go back home and I go back to the hospital.

858
00:46:00,872 --> 00:46:06,636
Rym: I say I still got the headache Basted yeah, and he didn't know he had no ideas.

859
00:46:06,656 --> 00:46:12,319
Rym: and then later I'm sitting there in this nurses examining me and she's like you don't happen to live near your vaster farm.

860
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:12,559
Rym: Do you?

861
00:46:13,781 --> 00:46:34,077
Rym: And I said I run there almost every day to which she said alright, take off your shirt, and then she looked and sure enough in my Sub bender or no my anti bender got to keep the term straight here in the middle of my anti benders a little bull's-eye shaped kind of rash To which she said you have Lyme disease.

862
00:46:36,465 --> 00:46:43,111
Scott: And I said great I'm glad you didn't bite me during that Wildwood trip.

863
00:46:43,552 --> 00:46:45,178
Rym: You can't get Lyme disease from biting.

864
00:46:45,339 --> 00:46:47,930
Rym: good You can only get it from dare ticks.

865
00:46:48,553 --> 00:46:49,215
Scott: Well, they bite.

866
00:46:49,235 --> 00:46:50,119
Scott: that's how they give it to you.

867
00:46:51,062 --> 00:46:52,715
Rym: Yeah, it doesn't work that way no

868
00:46:53,521 --> 00:46:55,589
Scott: but if you bit me the way a deer tick bites

869
00:46:56,152 --> 00:47:07,551
Rym: if I bit your arm and Held my mouth there for about a week slowly sinking my face deeper and deeper into you without you noticing eventually dying inside of your flesh then yeah

870
00:47:09,521 --> 00:47:10,955
Scott: Awesome, that would be great

871
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:11,459
Rym: now.

872
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:14,531
Rym: So I learned a lot about Lyme disease from all that and I learned that one.

873
00:47:14,551 --> 00:47:17,925
Rym: it's a horrible disease that fucks you permanently Unless you catch it.

874
00:47:18,327 --> 00:47:20,639
Rym: if you catch it within, you know several months of getting it.

875
00:47:21,021 --> 00:47:23,596
Rym: You just take antibiotics for a couple of hours and it goes away and you're fine forever.

876
00:47:24,039 --> 00:47:28,232
Rym: Yep Now some people get screwed because there's really no test for Lyme disease.

877
00:47:28,694 --> 00:47:34,063
Rym: So if you don't get that little bull's-eye rash There's really most doctors have no idea They won't catch it.

878
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,966
Rym: and there's a guy about.

879
00:47:35,026 --> 00:47:40,493
Scott: if I ever have a headache for two weeks and I've recently been in the woods I'm gonna be like I might have Lyme disease.

880
00:47:40,513 --> 00:47:41,097
Scott: Can you check?

881
00:47:41,399 --> 00:47:46,186
Rym: Yep I mean the worst case is they'll just make you take a horrible antibiotics for two months Which they'll make you kind of sick.

882
00:47:46,247 --> 00:47:48,477
Rym: but better that than what Lyme disease does.

883
00:47:48,497 --> 00:47:52,940
Rym: Oh god Yeah, because there's a guy at work who had Lyme disease for like I don't know how many years.

884
00:47:53,362 --> 00:47:57,280
Rym: Oh, yeah, and then they finally found out cuz Lyme disease is kind of a new phenomena.

885
00:47:57,641 --> 00:48:04,180
Scott: It was discovered recently and it's still not it's only decades old like in terms of humans knowing about it scientifically.

886
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:05,507
Rym: Yeah, it's named after that town.

887
00:48:05,607 --> 00:48:06,049
Rym: Lyme is.

888
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:06,974
Rym: I think it's in Connecticut.

889
00:48:07,034 --> 00:48:07,336
Rym: Actually.

890
00:48:07,356 --> 00:48:07,859
Rym: I think it is.

891
00:48:07,879 --> 00:48:10,333
Rym: Yeah Yeah, that's like the center of Lyme disease.

892
00:48:10,353 --> 00:48:13,827
Scott: Yeah, obviously Connect we were big on Lyme disease in Connecticut.

893
00:48:13,847 --> 00:48:16,135
Scott: Everyone always talked about it like check for ticks.

894
00:48:16,817 --> 00:48:17,760
Scott: Yeah line disease.

895
00:48:19,122 --> 00:48:22,194
Rym: For when I was very young I was deathly afraid to walk into tall grass.

896
00:48:22,234 --> 00:48:26,622
Rym: cuz I was like I'll get Lyme disease and I'll die Mmm, but yeah, it's fine Unless you get.

897
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:30,240
Rym: if you catch it is fine catch it as in catch the fact that you caught it.

898
00:48:30,862 --> 00:48:31,429
Rym: But this is not good.

899
00:48:32,553 --> 00:48:36,900
Rym: Yeah But this guy had it for years and years and then they finally figured out what it was by then it was too late.

900
00:48:37,021 --> 00:48:40,099
Rym: He's got permanent arthritis and like other troubles.

901
00:48:41,281 --> 00:48:44,073
Scott: Yeah, at least it's not like rabies or something.

902
00:48:44,334 --> 00:48:45,137
Rym: Yeah, just death.

903
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:47,706
Rym: Yeah Yeah, I was very happy.

904
00:48:47,787 --> 00:48:49,093
Rym: I just took some antibiotic.

905
00:48:49,113 --> 00:48:50,600
Scott: You're happy that you had Lyme disease.

906
00:48:50,902 --> 00:48:53,438
Rym: I was happy that I had no long-lasting ill effects from it.

907
00:48:53,901 --> 00:48:56,591
Scott: Yeah, maybe you do and just you don't realize.

908
00:48:56,992 --> 00:48:59,542
Rym: now cuz I went in for the follow-up and they were like, yeah It's gone.

909
00:48:59,944 --> 00:49:00,206
Scott: Uh-huh.

910
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:05,499
Rym: All right, plus I took horrible antibiotics for two months Mmm plus a penicillin shot.

911
00:49:06,201 --> 00:49:13,340
Rym: Wow, if you've ever had a penicillin shot It's syrupy and thick and it's a big-ass needle and they put it in your butt and it sucks ass.

912
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:13,982
Rym: It sucks.

913
00:49:14,122 --> 00:49:14,985
Scott: It really sucks.

914
00:49:15,065 --> 00:49:19,459
Scott: Yes, like most shots really don't suck like a TV test shot.

915
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:25,397
Scott: Nothing MMR nothing tetanus shot really sucks because it makes your shoulder feel like it's inflating shoulder.

916
00:49:25,457 --> 00:49:26,460
Rym: I had it stuck into my leg.

917
00:49:27,062 --> 00:49:28,688
Scott: Oh, I get the tetanus shots in the shoulder.

918
00:49:28,708 --> 00:49:32,140
Scott: Wow, and it makes you feel like your arm is inflating like a balloon.

919
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,425
Scott: It sucks see.

920
00:49:33,445 --> 00:49:37,706
Rym: they told me I could get have the shot wherever I wanted and they but they explained to me that it Tetanus shot.

921
00:49:37,727 --> 00:49:38,819
Rym: at least if you get it in your leg.

922
00:49:39,344 --> 00:49:46,721
Rym: The thing that will make a tetanus shot feel Less bad is to cut to flex the muscle a lot and work the muscle that it got injected into Mm-hmm.

923
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:51,139
Rym: So if you put it in your thigh that muscle gets worked a lot because you're walking on it all the time.

924
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:53,028
Rym: So it'll end up not hurting as much.

925
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:54,817
Scott: Yeah, maybe I don't know.

926
00:49:54,877 --> 00:49:55,380
Rym: That's what the doc.

927
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:56,687
Scott: I've had a tetanus shot in a while.

928
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:57,933
Scott: Maybe I should go get another one.

929
00:49:57,954 --> 00:50:00,671
Rym: You got to get one every 10 years You know, otherwise, you're not protected.

930
00:50:00,691 --> 00:50:01,980
Scott: I'm not worried.

931
00:50:02,161 --> 00:50:07,119
Rym: We got those freaking rusty tack things sticking up out of the carpet by the bag door.

932
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,366
Rym: Yeah, I step on those like every day.

933
00:50:10,386 --> 00:50:13,095
Scott: Yeah, I don't step on them, but I don't know.

934
00:50:13,516 --> 00:50:14,700
Scott: I don't have tetanus obviously.

935
00:50:15,042 --> 00:50:16,250
Rym: Yeah, you just like to bite things.

936
00:50:16,895 --> 00:50:21,192
Scott: Yeah Well, that would be rabies if I like to bite things.

937
00:50:21,413 --> 00:50:22,800
Rym: so should we tell the story of the hockey puck.

938
00:50:23,741 --> 00:50:27,820
Scott: Yeah, it's someone else's story, but they're not here now this one where it's better than any stories.

939
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:31,420
Scott: I've got left because I'm relatively free of illness and injury.

940
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:34,690
Rym: Yeah Though I will say preface this one story by.

941
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:35,633
Rym: we do have a moral.

942
00:50:36,055 --> 00:50:38,908
Rym: the moral is if you're at a hockey game Watch out for hockey pucks.

943
00:50:39,089 --> 00:50:40,860
Scott: god damn watch out for hockey pucks.

944
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:45,099
Rym: Cuz Scott and I. actually this hockey puck would have just as easily hit either Scott or me.

945
00:50:45,632 --> 00:50:55,810
Scott: Okay So right at RIT college hockey game right back when they were someone hits the puck and it goes up the glass and it goes Over the glass and somehow the way he hit it.

946
00:50:56,331 --> 00:51:05,920
Scott: It was basically coming across the seats Horizontally, so I'm sitting there on the side of on the long side of a hockey rink looking at the ice.

947
00:51:06,562 --> 00:51:14,513
Scott: I turned to the right and as a puck where if I didn't move would have hit me right in the face Like it was coming from the side.

948
00:51:15,136 --> 00:51:15,780
Scott: It was insane.

949
00:51:17,188 --> 00:51:23,820
Scott: so I Duck put my head between my legs and cover the back of my head with my hands and I go fuck.

950
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:40,579
Rym: Meanwhile, I'm turning to the right and I see Scott duck and suddenly there's this black thing and it's right in front of my face and I went like I made this girly kind of scream and I put my arm up like ah and it didn't hit my arm because if it hit my arm I would have been in a bad way.

951
00:51:41,097 --> 00:51:43,189
Scott: Oh You would have been in a very bad way and it.

952
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:48,048
Rym: but it was deflected slightly by my arm like it Just kind of touched my arm and I had a little mark.

953
00:51:48,971 --> 00:51:51,260
Rym: and then our friend I hear crack.

954
00:51:52,581 --> 00:51:56,953
Rym: We look and Alex is sitting there and we asked him did it hit you?

955
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,059
Rym: and he says did what hit me?

956
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:02,631
Scott: Or he said he wasn't very clear because it hit him.

957
00:52:02,871 --> 00:52:04,197
Rym: We're like he like he was gone.

958
00:52:04,257 --> 00:52:05,000
Rym: There was nothing there.

959
00:52:05,187 --> 00:52:14,400
Scott: Yeah the puck like hit him in the in the glasses and the glasses went into his head a little bit and he was bleeding and He was just like Hawaii totally dazed.

960
00:52:15,281 --> 00:52:19,560
Rym: And we're like, um, I don't remember if he actually had a concussion but he was gone.

961
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:24,316
Scott: He was totally gone and they always have ambulance guys there in case hockey players get injured.

962
00:52:24,336 --> 00:52:25,520
Scott: So we're like, hey take him away.

963
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:36,323
Rym: Yeah, they right now the funny thing is whenever a puck goes into the crowd There's always this chain give it to a kid give it to a kid and everyone will keep chanting it until you give the puck To a kid.

964
00:52:36,484 --> 00:52:39,200
Scott: Yeah, cuz you're not supposed to keep the puck you feel like a college.

965
00:52:39,321 --> 00:52:41,480
Rym: So we're all standing up around Alex and he's sitting there.

966
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,569
Rym: He has no idea what's going on because he's he's.

967
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:46,200
Rym: he's hitting the head with something and the whole crowd.

968
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:50,720
Rym: Shannon give it to a kid give it to a kid and we're like he got hit and then the whole crowd stops.

969
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:56,499
Scott: They're like, oh They're like, all right, you can keep it if you got hit.

970
00:52:57,281 --> 00:53:01,560
Rym: So I. they took him away and they gave me because I was the only one who had a car at the time.

971
00:53:02,282 --> 00:53:03,145
Rym: They were like they.

972
00:53:03,446 --> 00:53:07,640
Rym: I gave them my phone number and they said we'll call you with something and then they took him away.

973
00:53:09,002 --> 00:53:11,100
Rym: So the hockey game continues.

974
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:11,985
Scott: The hockey game continued.

975
00:53:12,025 --> 00:53:12,849
Scott: we were cheering.

976
00:53:12,910 --> 00:53:13,694
Scott: we forgot all.

977
00:53:13,714 --> 00:53:14,780
Scott: we didn't forget all about it.

978
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,149
Scott: But we you know, we're like woo hockey.

979
00:53:17,551 --> 00:53:18,635

00:53:19,097 --> 00:53:19,980
Scott: Yeah, we kept the puck.

981
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,225

00:53:21,486 --> 00:53:23,634
Rym: we get home we get home and I get a phone call.

983
00:53:23,675 --> 00:53:26,271

00:53:26,554 --> 00:53:27,220
Rym: I get a phone call.

985
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:29,426
Rym: Yeah, it's me Alex.

986
00:53:29,687 --> 00:53:30,632
Rym: They let me out of the hospital.

987
00:53:30,652 --> 00:53:31,415
Rym: Can you come pick me up?

988
00:53:31,877 --> 00:53:33,718
Rym: I was like, alright I'll be at strong in like 15 minutes.

989
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:36,147
Rym: He says I'm not at strong strong.

990
00:53:36,187 --> 00:53:38,856
Scott: If you don't know is the closest hospital to RIT.

991
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:40,220
Scott: It's an it's an okay hospital.

992
00:53:40,621 --> 00:53:42,207
Rym: I say, all right, what happened?

993
00:53:42,227 --> 00:53:43,732
Rym: He says well strong was full.

994
00:53:43,792 --> 00:53:46,300
Rym: So the ambulance was diverted hospital was full.

995
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:47,656
Rym: There were a lot of injuries that night.

996
00:53:48,604 --> 00:53:51,982
Rym: So that's they were diverted somewhere else and I asked all right Where are you?

997
00:53:52,063 --> 00:53:55,574
Rym: and he says the name of a town and I've never heard that town before.

998
00:53:55,594 --> 00:53:56,999
Rym: I had no idea what he said.

999
00:53:57,786 --> 00:53:59,060
Rym: Great, and he didn't know where it was.

1000
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:04,339
Rym: I didn't know where it was and it ended up taking me almost an hour to find the place in the blizzard.

1001
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:10,228
Rym: Awesome, it was great Yeah, so if you go to a hockey game watch for pucks.

1002
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:14,979
Scott: if you go to any sporting event and except for maybe basketball or Football those are pretty safe.

1003
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:19,738
Rym: Yeah, how many times have you seen a basketball player like charge and miss and just hit all those people in that front row?

1004
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:27,687
Scott: Maybe but mostly at baseball Hockey and I guess those are the big ones.

1005
00:54:27,707 --> 00:54:30,076
Scott: lacrosse could possibly hurt you soccer.

1006
00:54:30,096 --> 00:54:33,846
Rym: You gotta watch out for the fans Yeah But mostly baseball and hockey.

1007
00:54:34,167 --> 00:54:38,980
Scott: when you're at those sporting events watch the fuck out for the ball and the puck.

1008
00:54:39,202 --> 00:54:41,020
Scott: Oh my god pay the fuck attention.

1009
00:54:41,463 --> 00:54:44,320
Scott: It's not like a movie where you can just like doze off or whatever.

1010
00:54:44,702 --> 00:54:48,580
Scott: You gotta watch every single play to make sure the ball doesn't come and nail you.

1011
00:54:49,182 --> 00:54:52,555
Rym: Though in this case to Alex's credit that puck came out of nowhere.

1012
00:54:52,715 --> 00:54:55,449
Rym: it sure did guys We were sitting kind of low.

1013
00:54:55,469 --> 00:54:57,320
Scott: I didn't even realize it was out of the glass.

1014
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:09,080
Scott: I just I could have been in some serious trouble if like things were different by like a half a second Yeah, even less like tenths of a second because that thing was pretty much right on track to hit you square in the forehead.

1015
00:55:09,369 --> 00:55:12,171
Scott: Oh god I would have done well if I wouldn't have turned to the right.

1016
00:55:12,211 --> 00:55:15,146
Scott: it would hit me in the side of the head like Right in the temple.

1017
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:16,091
Rym: just that would have been worse.

1018
00:55:16,131 --> 00:55:16,775
Rym: that could have killed you.

1019
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:17,539
Scott: I could have killed me.

1020
00:55:17,923 --> 00:55:18,814
Scott: I turned to the right.

1021
00:55:18,834 --> 00:55:22,032
Scott: now I would have hit me square in the forehead or right in the middle of the face.

1022
00:55:22,434 --> 00:55:23,378
Scott: Oh broken my nose.

1023
00:55:23,418 --> 00:55:27,050
Scott: God knows Yeah, and then I ducked in a. my glad I ducked.

1024
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:30,120
Scott: Ooh, just makes me cringe thinking about what happened if it hit me.

1025
00:55:32,921 --> 00:55:36,280
Rym: All right, we've gone long so we're not gonna tell all the rest of our stories.

1026
00:55:36,621 --> 00:55:38,487
Scott: Oh, we have more tales of injury and illness.

1027
00:55:38,748 --> 00:55:40,112
Rym: I guess we'll have to save this for another.

1028
00:55:40,172 --> 00:55:44,960
Scott: I've already told that story of you know Food poisoning on the floor in the bathroom.

1029
00:55:45,021 --> 00:55:52,489
Rym: Yeah And I think I told my story of vomiting diary of food poisoning in New York City while poor Emily is sitting there holding the bucket.

1030
00:55:52,529 --> 00:55:53,474
Scott: Did you tell that story?

1031
00:55:53,494 --> 00:55:54,217
Rym: I think I did.

1032
00:55:54,237 --> 00:55:54,800
Scott: I don't know.

1033
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:55,925
Scott: That's the story needs to be told.

1034
00:55:55,945 --> 00:55:57,652
Rym: All right, we'll end on this story.

1035
00:55:57,893 --> 00:56:02,949
Rym: and the moral of this story is Don't get food poisoning because it sucks.

1036
00:56:03,611 --> 00:56:06,200
Scott: I think the more we'll end with the moral, but that's all right.

1037
00:56:06,481 --> 00:56:08,370
Rym: Yeah, but I like I don't.

1038
00:56:08,933 --> 00:56:13,433
Rym: I don't get sick that often Allergies which come a lot, but I don't get sick often.

1039
00:56:13,715 --> 00:56:14,800
Scott: I really don't get sick.

1040
00:56:14,961 --> 00:56:17,453
Scott: The only time I ever get sick is if I eat too much.

1041
00:56:17,513 --> 00:56:20,385
Scott: if I eat too much food I get like diarrhea.

1042
00:56:20,646 --> 00:56:22,552
Scott: and if I really eat too much food, I'll vomit.

1043
00:56:22,572 --> 00:56:24,317
Scott: but I haven't vomited in years.

1044
00:56:24,357 --> 00:56:25,180
Rym: He's like Jerry Seinfeld.

1045
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:25,963
Rym: He's got the streak.

1046
00:56:26,124 --> 00:56:27,048
Scott: I got the street going.

1047
00:56:27,088 --> 00:56:27,631
Scott: no vomits.

1048
00:56:27,792 --> 00:56:28,816
Rym: I gotta get me some Ipecac.

1049
00:56:28,836 --> 00:56:29,520
Rym: put a stop to this.

1050
00:56:29,921 --> 00:56:31,268
Scott: No, you're not gonna put a start to it.

1051
00:56:31,368 --> 00:56:32,774
Scott: I'm keeping the streak alive baby.

1052
00:56:32,795 --> 00:56:33,940
Scott: No vomits.

1053
00:56:34,221 --> 00:56:38,719
Rym: I like how the closest you got to losing the streak was when I was vomiting and it almost made you feel sick.

1054
00:56:39,565 --> 00:56:40,634
Scott: Look is the smell of bomb.

1055
00:56:40,654 --> 00:56:47,095
Rym: It's really nasty yeah, so I was in New York City with Emily and I'd like our state.

1056
00:56:47,135 --> 00:56:50,780
Rym: we like I. basically I never really been to New York City in any capacity for walk forever.

1057
00:56:51,161 --> 00:56:55,976
Rym: so I went there and you know tours and hanging out and doing all sorts of things and exploring the city.

1058
00:56:56,980 --> 00:57:02,395
Rym: and Exploring the city meant exploring food in the city and I had a sandwich at this deli down and like down downtown.

1059
00:57:02,415 --> 00:57:05,780
Rym: I Got food poisoning.

1060
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:10,574
Rym: I woke up the next morning and I felt kind of a and she would.

1061
00:57:10,614 --> 00:57:12,420
Rym: she had some homework and studying to do so.

1062
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:17,440
Rym: she Was kind of give me the hint and go leave me alone go wander around Manhattan and I was very uncooperative.

1063
00:57:17,744 --> 00:57:18,878
Rym: I'd rather just lay here in bed.

1064
00:57:20,341 --> 00:57:21,294
Rym: Then I vomited.

1065
00:57:22,861 --> 00:57:29,820
Rym: Great I thought all right, no big deal I must have something must have been bad that I ate whatever and I think she left at this point.

1066
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:33,639
Rym: So I'm alone in her like in the dorm apartment thing.

1067
00:57:34,882 --> 00:57:37,620
Rym: Then about an hour later I vomited again.

1068
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:39,322
Scott: Fantastic.

1069
00:57:39,865 --> 00:57:41,635
Rym: then about 45 minutes later.

1070
00:57:41,655 --> 00:57:42,520
Rym: I vomited again.

1071
00:57:43,502 --> 00:57:45,109
Rym: Three vomits at this point.

1072
00:57:45,431 --> 00:57:46,476
Rym: I took some Pepto Bismol.

1073
00:57:46,657 --> 00:57:51,014
Scott: good job I would have done that after the first vomit, but I guess late.

1074
00:57:51,135 --> 00:57:51,958
Scott: better late than never.

1075
00:57:52,058 --> 00:57:53,759
Rym: she came back And she got me the Pepto Bismol.

1076
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:57,469
Rym: Okay, then I vomited about a half hour later.

1077
00:57:57,490 --> 00:58:00,338
Rym: Okay, and then I vomited about 20 minutes later.

1078
00:58:00,418 --> 00:58:02,525
Rym: now at this point I'm not eating or drinking anything.

1079
00:58:02,625 --> 00:58:04,712
Rym: My body is making things for me to vomit.

1080
00:58:04,932 --> 00:58:09,007
Scott: great because you're already cleaned out all the way Yeah, but no diarrhea at all.

1081
00:58:09,207 --> 00:58:09,810
Rym: I'm getting to that.

1082
00:58:10,051 --> 00:58:12,019
Rym: Okay, those stuff kept coming out of my stomach.

1083
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:24,705
Rym: Then one time I was vomiting and then I felt this pain and then I turned around and I sat on the toilet and then I Diarrheated and then I turned around and I vomited And it was.

1084
00:58:24,927 --> 00:58:27,199
Rym: the smell was so disgusting that I vomited again.

1085
00:58:28,681 --> 00:58:32,280
Scott: So you vomited because you were sick and then you vomited because of the sickness.

1086
00:58:33,281 --> 00:58:38,316
Rym: Yeah, so I'm trying to keep as much like tepid ginger ale and water down as I can.

1087
00:58:38,377 --> 00:58:39,340
Scott: That's a good way to go.

1088
00:58:39,661 --> 00:58:44,720
Rym: Meanwhile, she's got like finals and work to study for like she doesn't have time to deal with my crap.

1089
00:58:45,342 --> 00:58:46,507
Rym: So I'm trying to play it tough.

1090
00:58:46,527 --> 00:58:47,008
Rym: Like don't worry.

1091
00:58:47,049 --> 00:58:50,100
Scott: I just called the ambulance and let them take me away it much easier.

1092
00:58:50,321 --> 00:58:51,185
Rym: Well, here's the problem.

1093
00:58:51,346 --> 00:58:52,652
Rym: I was starting to get dehydrated.

1094
00:58:53,013 --> 00:58:57,279
Rym: Yeah, when you get dehydrated You get a little delirious.

1095
00:58:57,782 --> 00:58:59,991
Rym: So I was not in my right mind by the time.

1096
00:59:00,011 --> 00:59:05,451
Rym: by the time I was at the point where I needed to go To the doctor if I vomit more than twice in rapid succession.

1097
00:59:05,471 --> 00:59:06,976
Scott: I'm already calling the ambulance.

1098
00:59:07,498 --> 00:59:07,980
Scott: It's the end.

1099
00:59:08,241 --> 00:59:10,512
Rym: Well when I've had flus before I would vomit like that.

1100
00:59:10,592 --> 00:59:11,376
Rym: That was nothing new.

1101
00:59:11,396 --> 00:59:12,220
Scott: Yeah, I noticed.

1102
00:59:13,521 --> 00:59:16,410
Rym: Well that other that time you saw me vomiting was also food poisoning.

1103
00:59:16,491 --> 00:59:18,698
Scott: Yeah, that doesn't matter fucking lasagna.

1104
00:59:18,898 --> 00:59:19,380
Scott: Got them.

1105
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:26,545
Rym: So by the time I got to the point where I was delirious and at which point she says I'm taking you to the Hospital good move.

1106
00:59:26,947 --> 00:59:29,759
Rym: So we're hobbling down the street toward the hospital with a bucket.

1107
00:59:30,383 --> 00:59:31,148
Rym: I don't think you need to.

1108
00:59:31,369 --> 00:59:32,920
Rym: I don't explain why we had the bucket.

1109
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:34,666
Rym: I felt bad that.

1110
00:59:34,707 --> 00:59:36,594
Scott: what if you had the diarrhea in the street?

1111
00:59:36,694 --> 00:59:37,397
Rym: I held that in.

1112
00:59:37,698 --> 00:59:39,364
Rym: Oh god I barely got.

1113
00:59:39,504 --> 00:59:39,624
Rym: now.

1114
00:59:39,645 --> 00:59:41,771
Rym: from this point on I barely remember anything.

1115
00:59:42,353 --> 00:59:44,480
Rym: I remember walking down the street with the bucket.

1116
00:59:45,186 --> 00:59:46,900
Rym: I remember sitting in the cab with the bucket.

1117
00:59:47,543 --> 00:59:51,260
Rym: I remember the cab driver really looking at me like what's that bucket for?

1118
00:59:53,085 --> 00:59:56,345
Rym: He found out We get to the hospital.

1119
00:59:56,365 --> 00:59:59,295
Rym: the hospital doesn't take emergency room patients.

1120
00:59:59,335 --> 01:00:00,540
Rym: We have to go to a different hospital.

1121
01:00:01,481 --> 01:00:04,215
Scott: That's why I would have called the ambulance instead of doing the hospital.

1122
01:00:04,235 --> 01:00:05,320
Rym: Well one is New York City.

1123
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:07,517
Rym: It would probably faster to go the way we did.

1124
01:00:08,161 --> 01:00:11,150
Scott: Yeah, the ambulances can be pretty quick depending on what's going on.

1125
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:13,798
Rym: But plus it wasn't life-threatening or anything.

1126
01:00:13,858 --> 01:00:14,440
Rym: It just sucked.

1127
01:00:15,042 --> 01:00:16,187
Scott: It was almost life-threatening.

1128
01:00:16,387 --> 01:00:19,560
Rym: Oh, yeah, but I'm sitting in the waiting room and I at this point I'm gone.

1129
01:00:19,984 --> 01:00:28,192
Rym: the next thing I remember is I'm laying in a hospital bed and They they're about to put an IV in me and they put an IV in me.

1130
01:00:28,212 --> 01:00:35,434
Rym: and that IV felt fucking great Because it was a. it was a drip of like nutrients and electrolytes and all this fun stuff.

1131
01:00:35,995 --> 01:00:37,500
Rym: Also an anti-nausea medication.

1132
01:00:38,144 --> 01:00:38,848
Scott: Ah, that's a good one.

1133
01:00:38,868 --> 01:00:40,760
Scott: So I don't make you feel real good.

1134
01:00:41,001 --> 01:00:45,999
Rym: I don't know if it was psychological or what but I could feel the good feeling coming into my arm from that thing.

1135
01:00:47,501 --> 01:00:50,493
Rym: Then the doctor comes over and he asks me you need anything?

1136
01:00:50,534 --> 01:00:52,060
Rym: and I said my back really hurts.

1137
01:00:52,802 --> 01:00:53,605
Scott: Did your back hurt?

1138
01:00:54,007 --> 01:00:54,830
Rym: Yeah, my back hurt.

1139
01:00:55,111 --> 01:00:57,278
Rym: I'm maybe from from being hunched over the toilet.

1140
01:00:57,359 --> 01:01:00,628
Rym: Yes He gave me some Percadine.

1141
01:01:00,789 --> 01:01:03,299
Rym: Whoo, and everything was fantastic for the next hour.

1142
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:11,057
Rym: alright now the worst part is after the IV finished and They'd done all the things they could do and I was basically cured.

1143
01:01:11,077 --> 01:01:13,948
Rym: at this point My stomach was a little dodgy, but I was okay.

1144
01:01:14,009 --> 01:01:15,474
Rym: I was no longer food poisoned.

1145
01:01:15,995 --> 01:01:17,300
Rym: I no longer had gastroenteritis.

1146
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:22,880
Rym: So she's worried because I obviously I was admitted to the hospital.

1147
01:01:23,542 --> 01:01:27,175
Rym: I walk out of the hospital whistling feeling great and I'm like, let's go get some dinner.

1148
01:01:27,657 --> 01:01:28,279
Rym: She about killed me.

1149
01:01:31,602 --> 01:01:34,899
Rym: Yeah, the moral is don't get food poisoning don't eat dodgy food.

1150
01:01:35,562 --> 01:01:36,766
Rym: Yeah, the food wasn't dodgy.

1151
01:01:36,786 --> 01:01:46,976
Rym: it was this nice-looking deli in downtown Manhattan and it was a good sandwich then Alright, so the moral of tonight's episode is we love morality.

1152
01:01:47,056 --> 01:01:47,980
Rym: turn turn turn.

1153
01:01:48,383 --> 01:01:53,295
Rym: Tell us the lesson that we should learn Avoid injury and illness at all cost.

1154
01:01:53,636 --> 01:01:54,380
Scott: Oh my god.

1155
01:01:54,661 --> 01:02:00,948
Rym: If you get food poisoning and you're vomiting a lot go to the doctor before I did You just do.

1156
01:02:01,089 --> 01:02:02,935
Scott: don't get injured and don't get sick.

1157
01:02:03,056 --> 01:02:04,340
Scott: do whatever you can to prevent it.

1158
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:09,400
Scott: It's the worst thing ever Like when you're a kid, it's great because you don't really get sick when you're a kid.

1159
01:02:09,762 --> 01:02:13,205
Scott: You just feel kind of and you don't go to school When you're an adult.

1160
01:02:13,365 --> 01:02:14,992
Scott: getting sick is like the worst thing ever.

1161
01:02:15,313 --> 01:02:20,469
Rym: actually when I was a little kid I caught a dangerous dangerous freaking flu.

1162
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:29,866
Scott: I Got like pneumonia once but then like all that did is I felt sick for one day and then I stayed home for a whole Week taking these pills, baby.

1163
01:02:29,947 --> 01:02:34,703
Scott: I didn't feel sick after the first day and I just watched The Price is Right and played video games All week.

1164
01:02:34,843 --> 01:02:37,136
Rym: I was hospitalized for the flu twice when I was a little kid.

1165
01:02:37,598 --> 01:02:43,479
Scott: Awesome I think I had the flu once and I was a little kid and I drank too much grape juice and I had purple vomit Coming out my mouth and nose.

1166
01:02:45,742 --> 01:02:54,100
Rym: One time when I had the flu when I was a kid I ate a whole bunch of green jello and Then I vomited the green jello and my little brother because he was really young at the time.

1167
01:02:54,422 --> 01:03:03,799
Rym: I remember him recounting the story later and he was like Brandon's mouth opened as wide as it could and a stream of green as big as his mouth just flew out.

1168
01:03:06,523 --> 01:03:07,286
Rym: It was all in one go.

1169
01:03:07,306 --> 01:03:08,110
Rym: it was like whoo.

1170
01:03:13,207 --> 01:03:20,460
Scott: Yeah, yeah so Do let other people near you get ill and injured because it can provide hilarity.

1171
01:03:20,621 --> 01:03:21,926
Rym: Yeah, I'm sure it was hilarious.

1172
01:03:21,946 --> 01:03:32,276
Rym: when you're laying in your bed trying to sleep and every 30 minutes you hear me go Bargo Bargo Bargo Bargo, it would have been hilarious if I wasn't trying to sleep and it wasn't so loud.

1173
01:03:32,296 --> 01:03:33,219
Scott: It was keeping me up.

1174
01:03:34,342 --> 01:03:37,720
Scott: If I could have just stood there going ha ha ha you're vomiting and I'm fine.

1175
01:03:37,861 --> 01:03:43,512
Rym: It was during the day that have been the greatest, you know, if you'd done that I probably would have just turned and vomited on you.

1176
01:03:43,532 --> 01:03:45,100
Scott: Yeah, have you vomited on me?

1177
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:48,775
Scott: I would just kick you right in the nuts and then you would have vomited again on you.

1178
01:03:48,796 --> 01:03:53,059
Scott: It doesn't matter You'd have a kicked in nut or two or three.

1179
01:03:55,384 --> 01:03:58,920
Rym: Actually, I Got into a fight with a kid when I was in elementary school.

1180
01:03:59,021 --> 01:04:01,139
Scott: I got a lot of fights and not so many of them.

1181
01:04:01,442 --> 01:04:02,230
Rym: It was a normal like.

1182
01:04:02,311 --> 01:04:03,280
Rym: it was gonna be a normal fight.

1183
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:04,529
Rym: We're standing there and we're about to.

1184
01:04:04,711 --> 01:04:05,920
Rym: we were like literally like second grade.

1185
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:07,788
Rym: I think all right, and we're about to punch each other.

1186
01:04:08,431 --> 01:04:16,033
Rym: then the bastard punches me in the balls And it it pushed one of my testicles up, yeah, that's happened.

1187
01:04:16,273 --> 01:04:17,556
Rym: like it read.

1188
01:04:17,636 --> 01:04:19,140
Rym: it read undescended my testicle.

1189
01:04:19,421 --> 01:04:20,285
Scott: Yeah, that's happened.

1190
01:04:20,827 --> 01:04:22,173
Rym: Yeah, you had the same thing happen.

1191
01:04:22,193 --> 01:04:30,431
Scott: It's a trick is if one of your nuts I learned the trick cuz I went to the doctor you jump up and down on the heels of your feet Just and then eventually your nut will come back out.

1192
01:04:30,451 --> 01:04:32,520
Rym: Wait, how often does this happen to you that you need a trick?

1193
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,500
Scott: Well, I had I'd use the trick once but I've taught the trick to other people nearby when it's happened to that.

1194
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:38,344
Rym: Yeah, I didn't know the trick.

1195
01:04:38,384 --> 01:04:39,870
Rym: So I was fine after he punched me.

1196
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:40,714
Rym: I was like you fucker.

1197
01:04:40,734 --> 01:04:42,607
Rym: Well, I didn't say fucker I was a little kid.

1198
01:04:42,627 --> 01:04:44,822
Rym: I was like you Dick.

1199
01:04:45,022 --> 01:04:54,755
Rym: I said dick when I was a kid for some reason I'd fuck was out of bounds, but I could say dickhead all right, and Then about for a couple hours later was like there's a pain and it's getting worse.

1200
01:04:54,815 --> 01:04:55,417
Rym: and it's getting worse.

1201
01:04:55,458 --> 01:05:01,108
Rym: and oh god I went to the doctor and they're like, I'm gonna make you not fall back down And he made my nut fall back down.

1202
01:05:01,228 --> 01:05:02,795
Rym: Yeah, then he taught me how to make it fall down.

1203
01:05:02,836 --> 01:05:13,500
Rym: if that ever happened again Just jump up and down stand on the heels of your feet only and jump up and down now also Don't like be careful with it because if it's your leg can kind of crush it in there.

1204
01:05:13,841 --> 01:05:16,030
Rym: Yeah, yeah, you know what go.

1205
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:18,320
Scott: you'll know because you'll feel you're like crushing it in there.

1206
01:05:18,582 --> 01:05:20,100
Rym: Yeah, it's a sensitive thing.

1207
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:24,440
Scott: But I mean like you happen to me once and I learned the trick from someone and then it happened to someone in gym class.

1208
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:32,191
Rym: So I told him the trick and you know, yeah tomorrow there if someone punches you in the balls It fall down because that's all you can do.

1209
01:05:32,211 --> 01:05:36,954
Rym: Yeah, but as soon as you get back up I don't care how good a friend they are punch them right in the ball.

1210
01:05:37,135 --> 01:05:38,100
Scott: No kick them.

1211
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:43,337
Scott: You got to get your shin right across the whole groin just straight up.

1212
01:05:43,377 --> 01:05:46,324
Scott: just wham That's the best way.

1213
01:05:46,345 --> 01:05:52,771
Rym: no, no, cuz the punch is better you stand up and you're like you asshole But you act like you're like that was funny though, ha ha ha.

1214
01:05:53,153 --> 01:05:54,820
Rym: and then you're like, alright, whatever.

1215
01:05:55,021 --> 01:05:58,440
Rym: And then as soon as he moves to like shake hands or anything, then you punch him in the balls.

1216
01:05:59,382 --> 01:06:01,191
Rym: His name was Ricky and I never got back at it.

1217
01:06:01,633 --> 01:06:02,980
Scott: Oh, maybe we meet him one day.

1218
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:04,687
Scott: You can just kick him right in the frickin.

1219
01:06:04,707 --> 01:06:06,394
Rym: just I don't even know his last name.

1220
01:06:06,494 --> 01:06:07,760
Rym: I barely knew my last name.

1221
01:06:09,721 --> 01:06:12,168
Rym: I still remember in like preschool or whatever.

1222
01:06:12,209 --> 01:06:15,739
Rym: We'd ever name tags, and I didn't know my last name, but it was there.

1223
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:21,859
Rym: Mmm, I knew my first name and I was always mad because kids with shorter first names could finish their homework quicker.

1224
01:06:23,321 --> 01:06:28,658
Scott: All right, this episode got real long so I guess you picked an okay topic then.

1225
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:35,894
Rym: yeah Yay Tell us all your funny or horrible injury stories in the forums.

1226

1228
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:51,800
Scott: pretty much anything is okay as long as it doesn't involve science technology Video games board games role-playing games anime manga or comics.

1229
01:06:52,323 --> 01:06:55,560
Rym: Yeah, and we've got a lot that were already suggested and we're going to do those at some point.

1230
01:06:55,921 --> 01:07:01,220
Scott: Yeah, all the but the problem is a lot of the things that aren't just talking about a geekery require lots of effort.

1231
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:04,031
Scott: So come up with something that also doesn't require effort.

1232
01:07:04,272 --> 01:07:05,496

Rym: Not really, but it's you know We're running out of stories that we can tell with some sort of pretext like blah blah blah video games.

1239
01:07:21,742 --> 01:07:24,191
Rym: Oh, well when I was little video game story.

1240
01:07:24,673 --> 01:07:26,440
Rym: Yeah, most of our stories are gonna be alright.

Rym: I'm gonna tell a completely unrelated story.
