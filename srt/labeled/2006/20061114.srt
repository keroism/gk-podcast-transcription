1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,407
Rym: It's Tuesday November 14th.

2
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:14,358
Rym: I'm Rym and I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:20,141
Rym: tonight We review an old classic dig dug for the Atari 7800.

4
00:00:20,141 --> 00:00:21,157
Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:23,381 --> 00:00:30,989
Scott: So I'm actually doing work find a new job, oh really it's kind of weird because every time Previously I've ever looked for a new job.

6
00:00:31,512 --> 00:00:32,797
Scott: It's always been like oh, man.

7
00:00:32,837 --> 00:00:33,420
Scott: I need a job.

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,431
Scott: I don't have one right now, but now I'm looking for a job.

9
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:36,592
Scott: Well.

10
00:00:36,652 --> 00:00:42,733
Scott: I've got a job, so I'm just like ha ha You better offer me something good, or I'm not leaving.

11
00:00:42,934 --> 00:00:44,059
Scott: I'm fine where I am.

12
00:00:44,521 --> 00:00:46,451
Rym: See I'm doing something different for the first time too.

13
00:00:46,491 --> 00:00:52,600
Rym: instead of looking for a new job right now I'm looking more to see if I can get a gigantic raise or a promotion at my current job.

14
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:53,541
Scott: Hmm.

15
00:00:53,802 --> 00:00:57,335
Scott: I've never actually you know tried to climb the corporate ladder in any way.

16
00:00:57,355 --> 00:00:57,777
Scott: Well.

17
00:00:57,817 --> 00:00:58,540
Rym: I just want more money.

18
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,865
Rym: I don't care about the corporate ladder.

19
00:00:59,885 --> 00:01:03,760
Rym: I just I want more money, and I'm overqualified for my position.

20
00:01:03,921 --> 00:01:06,055
Scott: Yeah, I applied for actually a bunch of jobs.

21
00:01:06,156 --> 00:01:19,162
Scott: just one of them I happen to interview for today on the phone, but like I applied for some managerial position Which actually be pretty cool if I had that because you know imagine a job where all I do is talk to people and do Papers.

22
00:01:19,283 --> 00:01:23,420
Rym: be so easy now because I've done stuff like that and it's kind of easy.

23
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:29,480
Rym: But at the same time you're managing people because usually those people don't know what to do on their own.

24
00:01:30,104 --> 00:01:35,893
Scott: Yeah, but I imagine if I'm managing programmers We speak the same language, so I could definitely get them to do what I want.

25
00:01:36,374 --> 00:01:37,780
Rym: We'll see we'll see.

26
00:01:38,502 --> 00:01:39,465
Scott: I only applied for it.

27
00:01:39,525 --> 00:01:40,628
Scott: I sent someone a resume.

28
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:44,440
Scott: It's basically nothing yeah, so I'm just pointing that out that I did that.

29
00:01:45,348 --> 00:01:49,840
Scott: But yeah the guy on the phone He didn't really ask me the tough technical questions that have been asked in the past.

30
00:01:50,364 --> 00:01:59,631
Scott: And I'm I'm sort of afraid with the job I interviewed for because it's like writing Linux kernel modules which I haven't done But I believe I am capable of learning.

31
00:01:59,692 --> 00:02:00,817
Rym: well you're gonna buy that book.

32
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:02,504
Scott: yeah Decided it's real.

33
00:02:02,585 --> 00:02:12,960
Scott: I looked at the book in the borders, and it's actually writing Linux kernel modules Isn't as tricky as I thought it was but it you know it's still tricky, and I'm actually real interested.

34
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,874
Scott: I'm probably gonna do it whether I get a job doing it or not.

35
00:02:16,396 --> 00:02:22,516
Rym: so yeah Maybe we could write some drivers for these Sony recordy bits not without document.

36
00:02:22,556 --> 00:02:24,040
Rym: do some reverse engineering.

37
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:25,123
Scott: Yes, that's the one thing.

38
00:02:25,143 --> 00:02:32,247
Scott: I could probably write a driver for a piece of hardware if I had the documentation for it But without documentation.

39
00:02:32,287 --> 00:02:32,749
Scott: I got nothing.

40
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:34,256
Scott: I'm basically hopeless.

41
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:38,180
Rym: yeah Yeah, so we only have one news really.

42
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:46,533
Rym: But that news has far-reaching ramifications for if you're not aware which means you know you're living under a rock Maybe you're blind and deaf.

43
00:02:46,976 --> 00:02:47,439
Rym: I don't know.

44
00:02:47,841 --> 00:03:00,905
Rym: Maybe you've never heard of this internet thing, but the ps3 the PlayStation 3 was released in Japan three days ago And there's a lot of news about this and it's coming out in the u.s..

45
00:03:01,286 --> 00:03:02,369
Scott: Three days from today.

46
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:08,645
Scott: well tonight and the Wii comes out five days from tonight and Since next week.

47
00:03:08,786 --> 00:03:11,338
Scott: I'm gonna get the Wii on launch at the Nintendo store.

48
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,607
Scott: so next week All we're being able to talk about is we.

49
00:03:13,747 --> 00:03:14,952
Scott: it's gonna be we we we we.

50
00:03:15,012 --> 00:03:17,180
Scott: so it's gonna be we right now.

51
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,740
Scott: We're gonna cover all things ps3 to get it out of the way, so we don't have to talk about next week.

52
00:03:22,921 --> 00:03:24,772
Rym: Well also, there's so much.

53
00:03:25,155 --> 00:03:26,000
Scott: there is so much.

54
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,127
Scott: It's gonna take up the whole news.

55
00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:29,360
Rym: remember way back when you know the Jack Thompson rule.

56
00:03:29,721 --> 00:03:33,554
Rym: I won't talk about Jack Thompson or Sony unless they top themselves.

57
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:33,815
Scott: Well.

58
00:03:33,835 --> 00:03:36,844
Scott: This isn't really a Sony story It's a PlayStation story.

59
00:03:36,905 --> 00:03:41,620
Scott: It's like if I had a story about a specific like the Ford Taurus.

60
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:42,464
Scott: It's not a Ford.

61
00:03:42,504 --> 00:03:43,046
Rym: so you know.

62
00:03:43,247 --> 00:03:49,390
Scott: I would say this is a Sony story because Sony is pretty well Maybe parts of it or so no stories and parts of it or PlayStation.

63
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:54,144
Rym: Sony is pretty much putting their whole bank on the Ps3 and blu-ray.

64
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:57,655
Rym: if the ps3 doesn't do well Sony's in deep.

65
00:03:58,357 --> 00:03:59,259
Rym: It's not gonna do so.

66
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:02,949
Scott: well Sony's already you know whatever.

67
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:04,917
Scott: why it's not what?

68
00:04:05,018 --> 00:04:05,399
Scott: what do you mean?

69
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:05,600
Scott: What?

70
00:04:07,004 --> 00:04:07,429
Rym: What do you mean?

71
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:07,914
Rym: whatever?

72
00:04:07,935 --> 00:04:08,015
Scott: well?

73
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:14,009
Scott: They're already not in like huge financial gains compared to what they were in the walk I actually from that.

74
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:25,126
Scott: not only are they not gains But they've been doing very poorly across the board and even so PlayStation isn't like a large portion of their business Businesses still selling TVs and shit.

75
00:04:25,226 --> 00:04:30,320
Rym: actually they put more money into the PlayStation 3 than they've put into pretty much anything.

76
00:04:30,902 --> 00:04:38,618
Rym: yeah, the PlayStation 3 and blu-ray are the future flagships of Sony and We'll see what happens with that.

77
00:04:39,202 --> 00:04:39,724
Scott: And I wouldn't.

78
00:04:39,804 --> 00:04:43,780
Scott: I don't think Sony is gonna be going like out of business or anything like that anytime soon.

79
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:47,234
Rym: I think Sony's gonna be in a lot of trouble in the next couple years.

80
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:48,720
Rym: I think there's gonna be some layoffs.

81
00:04:49,844 --> 00:04:58,680
Rym: I don't think so, but anyway to start off They only sold eighty eight thousand four hundred ps3s over the course of two days.

82
00:04:59,526 --> 00:05:00,574
Scott: But how many did they release?

83
00:05:00,614 --> 00:05:01,280
Scott: a hundred thousand?

84
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:06,896
Rym: I think they said they released a hundred thousand But I haven't seen anything that directly confirms this.

85
00:05:06,956 --> 00:05:07,620
Rym: that I would trust.

86
00:05:08,022 --> 00:05:16,400
Rym: But from what all I've read a lot of the news sites are reporting that Almost all of the ps3s sold out which would lead me to believe that not all of them sold.

87
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:32,020
Scott: Hmm it's a tough call because if not all of them sold then either they didn't ship the hundred thousand they said and they did all sell or Why are people buying these things at such high prices in stores if not all of them sold?

88
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,420
Rym: Well, it could be that some of them just haven't been registered as sold yet.

89
00:05:35,881 --> 00:05:44,020
Rym: It could be that the people who don't have one now are bidding on those auction sites because even though there's a few left They know they can't get one anyway.

90
00:05:44,100 --> 00:06:00,224
Scott: Hmm or maybe Sony didn't actually ship a hundred thousand could be you know what whichever the answer is I have no idea But the numbers that are reported by websites say that a hundred thousand were supposed to be shipped and like in two days 88,000 sold.

91
00:06:00,525 --> 00:06:05,540
Scott: you would expect you know any console would sell all hundred thousand in the first day.

92
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:08,576
Scott: Yeah, but it's Japan who knows craziness well.

93
00:06:08,617 --> 00:06:12,970
Rym: more importantly I think this is the big news eight eight thousand four hundred ps3s were sold.

94
00:06:13,391 --> 00:06:20,733
Scott: how many ps3 games were sold I don't know, but there weren't that great a launch games.

95
00:06:20,773 --> 00:06:22,500
Scott: I mean what they have Ridge racers seven.

96
00:06:23,044 --> 00:06:27,145
Scott: There was a Gundam game which actually look pretty cool And I don't know any of the other games.

97
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:27,687
Scott: really they didn't.

98
00:06:28,028 --> 00:06:31,056
Scott: at least none were well known or cool.

99
00:06:31,116 --> 00:06:34,443
Rym: Well the answer is that 62,000 one.

100
00:06:34,463 --> 00:06:36,652
Rym: oh no no I'm looking at the wrong number nevermind.

101
00:06:37,234 --> 00:06:37,595
Rym: You know what?

102
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:39,682
Rym: just under 80,000 games were sold.

103
00:06:39,702 --> 00:06:46,521
Rym: the ps3 sold less games than Ps3s.

104
00:06:46,922 --> 00:06:50,432
Rym: more people bought ps3s than bought ps3 games.

105
00:06:50,712 --> 00:06:52,658
Scott: well what this tells me is a couple things.

106
00:06:52,718 --> 00:07:02,280
Scott: number one Someone's buying this thing just as a blu-ray player Which if you're after a blu-ray player is not such a bad idea because a blu-ray player costs more money than a ps3.

107
00:07:03,042 --> 00:07:05,760
Scott: Number two it's actually it's a computer.

108
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,487
Scott: You can install Linux on this thing and use it.

109
00:07:07,568 --> 00:07:10,540
Rym: no one bought a ps3 for that purpose now.

110
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,112
Scott: So I think someone at least one guy bought it to use as a computer.

111
00:07:14,293 --> 00:07:14,955
Rym: I doubt it.

112
00:07:14,975 --> 00:07:16,300
Rym: It's especially in Japan.

113
00:07:16,621 --> 00:07:22,696
Scott: Well yeah, but I mean for the power of the PlayStation power that you really can't access so readily.

114
00:07:22,716 --> 00:07:24,902
Scott: you can install Linux on it You're just fine.

115
00:07:24,922 --> 00:07:34,999
Rym: now cuz the cell processor is not that standard or well understood by most people and anyone trying to use The ps3 as a computer is gonna run into a lot of problems.

116
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:41,019
Scott: Yeah, but some awesome you think about the Linux hacker in Japan has got it already so he can you know?

117
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,736
Scott: Compile all these open source programs for cell and start shipping them out.

118
00:07:45,957 --> 00:07:51,323
Rym: Yeah, whatever I don't see that being a factor as not many people, but this is one guy I don't think it's even any.

119
00:07:51,463 --> 00:07:57,240
Rym: I don't think anyone who has the money and the care to buy a ps3 cares about Linux.

120
00:07:58,223 --> 00:08:07,400
Scott: I think that there I think I don't think it's people that care about the ps3 care about Linux and these people Care about Linux have care now care about the ps3 because it runs Linux.

121
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:11,993
Rym: Well, I would furthermore say that anyone who does that it's not a useful endeavor.

122
00:08:12,013 --> 00:08:14,460
Rym: the ps3 is not going to be a useful computer.

123
00:08:14,881 --> 00:08:20,404
Rym: Computers themselves are going to far outpace the ps3 in short order anyway but it does.

124
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:29,959
Scott: if it it really depends on how useful as a computer will be because First of all getting a blu-ray drive in your computer is very expensive more expensive than buying a ps3.

125
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,179
Scott: Well that is true and someone might want a blu-ray drive in a computer and to well wait wait wait.

126
00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:37,385
Rym: Someone might want a blu-ray drive.

127
00:08:37,746 --> 00:08:42,460
Rym: There's such a small market for blu-ray or HD DVD at all in the first place.

128
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:48,320
Scott: Yeah, but also the PlayStation 3 has really good TV outputs.

129
00:08:48,682 --> 00:08:51,620
Scott: So you know like how we have the Mac plugged into the TV?

130
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,751
Scott: And there's an obvious difference between plugging it into the computer screen.

131
00:08:54,831 --> 00:08:59,147
Scott: if you have a PlayStation 3 with an HD Cable plugged into your HD TV.

132
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:02,540
Scott: That's a pretty good computer with TV output right there.

133
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:09,240
Rym: But you'd get a similar or if not better thing by plugging a regular computer into a regular computer monitor.

134
00:09:09,864 --> 00:09:12,179
Scott: Yeah, but what if you want to get a computer that plugs into a TV?

135
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,022
Rym: You know what?

136
00:09:13,565 --> 00:09:15,153
Rym: if you just what are you gonna use it for?

137
00:09:15,173 --> 00:09:18,365
Rym: I mean if you're using it as a computer You're better off using a monitor.

138
00:09:18,686 --> 00:09:27,815
Rym: if you're using it to watch stuff most stuff you watch from the internet is not HD Anyway, and it'll look just fine on a normal TV with a normal RCA connection.

139
00:09:28,256 --> 00:09:29,660
Scott: I'm just saying that you know I know.

140
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,938
Rym: I'm just saying that I don't think anyone who is smart enough to think it through would buy the ps3 as a.

141
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:43,478
Scott: The final reason that they've sold less games than ps3s is obviously because a lot of people bought ps3s just to sell on eBay And that means you don't buy any games.

142
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:50,899
Rym: There are somewhat dubious reports that one gentleman through a small network of homeless people purchased about a hundred ps3s.

143
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,700
Scott: I don't know how much I believe that story, but it could be going to resell all of them.

144
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:05,780
Rym: But the news and this has been reported in several places Is that the majority of the ps3s according to shop owners were purchased by homeless people and Chinese nationals?

145
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:06,961
Scott: Mm-hmm.

146
00:10:07,262 --> 00:10:15,306
Rym: and most of them look like they were being purchased by these people for the express purpose of being shunted through some sort of Gray-market and resold at a profit.

147
00:10:15,788 --> 00:10:18,798
Rym: someone was going around rounding up bums and paying them to buy ps3s.

148
00:10:19,521 --> 00:10:21,048
Scott: So we're gonna go on Sunday.

149
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:26,911
Scott: We're gonna round up bums and get him to buy wheeze And we're gonna sell them all on a gray market somewhere.

150
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:28,317
Rym: Why don't we just do that with a ps3?

151
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,731
Scott: Because it's a lot more money to get it started up.

152
00:10:33,012 --> 00:10:34,478
Scott: We need the money to buy enough ps3s.

153
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:35,983
Rym: We wouldn't we?

154
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:41,260
Rym: even if we bought one ps3 and sold it that but then we wouldn't need a bum to do it.

155
00:10:42,104 --> 00:10:56,920
Rym: Yes, we would because I don't want to sit in line for two days Pay a bum, you know two bottles of MD 2020 and five bucks to buy a third bottle of MD 2020 At a later day, how do you know?

156
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,101
Scott: He just won't take your PlayStation 3 money and then buy a crate of MD 2020.

157
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:07,336
Rym: Well depends if you find a stupid bum you stick a collar on his arm and tell him it'll explode.

158
00:11:07,737 --> 00:11:08,580
Rym: He doesn't come back.

159
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:14,372
Rym: Or or you simply say I will find you and kill you.

160
00:11:14,392 --> 00:11:16,297
Rym: I have people watching you.

161
00:11:16,317 --> 00:11:17,300
Rym: I will be in that.

162
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,873
Scott: Okay, you'd have to be a really stupid bum.

163
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,040
Rym: You know what if he's a hobo?

164
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:35,486
Rym: He's probably not that bright to begin with But regardless of all that at least the ps3 is out and people are starting are starting to use them though I have seen almost no reviews of actual Usage of the ps3.

165
00:11:36,048 --> 00:11:40,920
Rym: all anyone talks about is either that they got one or that they tried to get one But no one's talking about the game.

166
00:11:40,960 --> 00:12:04,293
Scott: I've seen if some talk about Comparisons between Ridge Racer 7 on the ps3 and Ridge Racer 6 on the 360 and basically what they're talking about is graphics Which I don't give a shit about but they they're showing these pictures of what the same Track with the same car looks like on both systems and in some ways the ps3 looks a lot better Like it's brighter and shinier and looks like higher resolution.

167
00:12:04,313 --> 00:12:06,380
Scott: I don't think the resolutions actually higher.

168
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,406
Scott: I think it's both 720p but whatever.

169
00:12:09,088 --> 00:12:12,579
Scott: but in other ways the PlayStation threes graphics aren't as good like this.

170
00:12:13,302 --> 00:12:19,040
Scott: Models missing, you know that are in the 360 and there's different details on different things.

171
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:25,900
Scott: So it's tough to objectively say which one is graphically superior playing that this is almost the same game.

172
00:12:26,644 --> 00:12:29,037
Scott: But a lot of people like oh man the ps3 sucks.

173
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,595
Scott: It doesn't look as good as the 360 and other people like oh man 360 looks just fine.

174
00:12:33,635 --> 00:12:35,100
Scott: the ps3, you know, whatever.

175
00:12:35,263 --> 00:12:41,898
Rym: But yeah The one problem that a lot of people have reported is that the backward compatibility with ps2 games isn't working.

176
00:12:41,938 --> 00:12:47,160
Scott: So well That's a toughie because you know, there's not too many ps3 games out right now.

177
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,179
Scott: So someone who buys this to play games.

178
00:12:49,581 --> 00:12:54,236
Scott: They're probably gonna be looking to play downloaded games and I don't think the download network is working yet.

179
00:12:54,337 --> 00:12:54,537
Scott: Is it?

180
00:12:54,999 --> 00:12:55,340
Scott: I don't know.

181
00:12:55,501 --> 00:12:55,903
Rym: I don't know.

182
00:12:55,964 --> 00:12:57,292
Rym: I don't know anything about that.

183
00:12:57,312 --> 00:13:00,949
Scott: Yeah, and They're gonna want to play some ps2 games on it.

184
00:13:01,109 --> 00:13:04,020
Scott: and whether they say almost 200 ps2 games don't work?

185
00:13:04,282 --> 00:13:10,039
Rym: according to CNET Japan currently 196 ps2 titles have been reported as to not play at all.

186
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:10,882
Scott: Are people just?

187
00:13:10,902 --> 00:13:17,967
Scott: it's like a hundred and people trying to play games and calling them in or did someone sit there with every ps2 Game trying to play them one by one.

188
00:13:18,489 --> 00:13:23,478
Rym: I see a lot of reports and I think it's people calling in Wow cuz no one bought games for the ps3.

189
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:27,375
Rym: So what are they gonna use it for to play old Gran Turismo?

190
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,761
Scott: Yeah Kingdom Hearts 2.

191
00:13:28,761 --> 00:13:34,809
Rym: Yeah, when I you could buy a hundred Slim ps2 Final Fantasy 12 to do all that.

192
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,273
Scott: Yeah, you could this.

193
00:13:36,293 --> 00:13:38,500
Scott: you know, the PS the slim ps2 is pretty hot.

194
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,888
Scott: It's just 130 bucks.

195
00:13:39,928 --> 00:13:44,779
Rym: And for that money, I get a DS lite, you know I'd buy a slim ps2 if the Wii weren't coming out right now.

196
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,786
Rym: Yeah, because I got some gaming.

197
00:13:46,806 --> 00:13:47,367
Rym: it's weird.

198
00:13:47,428 --> 00:13:51,628
Scott: the DS lite cost the same as the ps2 and the PSP cost the same as the Wii.

199
00:13:52,922 --> 00:13:53,848
Scott: It's kind of crazy.

200
00:13:54,391 --> 00:13:58,512
Rym: and also down at gizmodo They showed a picture about how the ps3 is.

201
00:13:58,532 --> 00:14:03,757
Rym: they just took out of the box Was almost immediately and easily scratched to hell.

202
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:15,618
Rym: All right First of all, I want to say I'm tired of the people complaining like oh my god All the Mac users like yeah, there's a tiny scratch on the back of my iPod after I dropped it on the cement.

203
00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:17,082
Scott: exactly It's like hello.

204
00:14:17,163 --> 00:14:18,808
Scott: It's a piece of electronic equipment.

205
00:14:18,888 --> 00:14:20,955
Scott: a scratch does not modify its functionality.

206
00:14:21,015 --> 00:14:21,637
Scott: who gives a shit?

207
00:14:21,657 --> 00:14:22,640
Scott: people aren't gonna look at.

208
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,080
Scott: You know, it's not like you have a big wart on your forehead or something nasty.

209
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:27,009
Scott: That's gonna make people go.

210
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,200
Scott: Oh, you're terrible person.

211
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:35,689
Rym: Well to me the issue is simply that a lot of companies now say well Sony lately and Apple has been doing this to agree to.

212
00:14:35,729 --> 00:14:41,679
Rym: they'll make something that looks really really shiny and awesome Like it looks super super awesome.

213
00:14:42,161 --> 00:14:49,199
Rym: But as a result, it's made so that if you look at it wrong, it scratches up real quick and suddenly looks like shit.

214
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:56,760
Rym: Why not just make it durable like I don't know Nintendo Nintendo products or even even earlier Sony products?

215
00:14:57,201 --> 00:14:59,410
Scott: Yeah, frickin PlayStation 1 is frickin.

216
00:14:59,451 --> 00:15:01,077
Scott: that thing could take a beating guy.

217
00:15:01,097 --> 00:15:04,309
Rym: PlayStation Well, my ps1 Sega Genesis controllers.

218
00:15:04,691 --> 00:15:05,172
Scott: Holy shit.

219
00:15:05,192 --> 00:15:06,457
Scott: Those things kick around.

220
00:15:06,477 --> 00:15:07,260
Rym: We're still using them.

221
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:12,000
Scott: We are yeah, but on the other hand, you know, I don't really care if shit gets scratched.

222
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:14,894
Scott: But on the other hand, it's like fine China.

223
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:16,040
Rym: How many hands do you have?

224
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,830
Scott: I got a lot of hands, but fine China.

225
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,460
Scott: right you go to the store you buy really expensive China.

226
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:29,610
Scott: All right, if you use the China properly if you wash it by hand in the sink and you eat dinner off of it And you know, it'll be fine.

227
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:30,675
Scott: It won't get scratched.

228
00:15:30,856 --> 00:15:31,580
Scott: It'll be all good.

229
00:15:31,982 --> 00:15:34,232
Scott: It only will scratch up if you drop it and break it.

230
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:46,299
Scott: China is a very fragile thing but in normal use it will hold up as long as you you know, don't try to put it in the dishwasher or Frickin use like a Brillo pad on it or anything stupid like that.

231
00:15:46,941 --> 00:15:57,510
Scott: If you make a product any product in any category that is not some disposable product and it gets Marked up in normal use that is a problem.

232
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:01,768
Scott: if it's damaged in any way in normal everyday use That is not good.

233
00:16:01,848 --> 00:16:14,457
Scott: No matter what the product is You know if your car get the paint job gets scratched driving around if you know I don't know the upholstery on your chair and your living room gets all roughed up just sitting in it.

234
00:16:14,758 --> 00:16:18,991
Scott: That's not good That's a problem Even if I don't personally think it's a big deal.

235
00:16:19,051 --> 00:16:32,738
Scott: if an iPod or a ps3 has scratches on it Like I wouldn't give a shit at all as long as it you know It doesn't hinder the use of the object But at the same time to have something that gets screwed up, but just not using it normally is not cool.

236
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:33,620
Scott: Not cool.

237
00:16:34,001 --> 00:16:36,732
Rym: Yeah, well, I know that your iPod is pretty scratched to hell.

238
00:16:36,772 --> 00:16:38,900
Scott: It is pretty scratched to hell, but it works just fine.

239
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,624
Scott: What do I care?

240
00:16:40,468 --> 00:16:40,870
Scott: It's cool.

241
00:16:41,151 --> 00:16:42,840
Scott: I can still see the screen just fine.

242
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,006
Scott: You don't even notice the scratches unless you you know looking at it like oh my god It's scratched up.

243
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:50,479
Rym: though back on the homefront here in the u.s.

244
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:56,760
Rym: GameStop had a I mean, they weren't entirely sure how many ps3s they were gonna get and they wanted to be cautious.

245
00:16:57,262 --> 00:17:00,775
Rym: So they only offered a very limited number of pre-orders at their stores.

246
00:17:00,856 --> 00:17:01,960
Scott: Yeah, I mean, what did they say?

247
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,768
Scott: 400,000 ps3s are coming to the u.s.

248
00:17:04,828 --> 00:17:05,310
Scott: In three days.

249
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:07,678
Rym: I don't know if that's gonna happen now.

250
00:17:07,858 --> 00:17:08,140
Scott: I don't know.

251
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,691
Scott: well We don't even know if a hundred thousand They said we're gonna come out in Japan did.

252
00:17:12,852 --> 00:17:16,211
Rym: I've seen people saying only 200,000 for the American release.

253
00:17:16,251 --> 00:17:17,859
Scott: Well, we'll find out in three days.

254
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,200
Scott: But either way they say is four hundred thousand in the u.s.

255
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:25,078
Scott: So GameStop, you know went by those numbers and kind of estimated how many ps3s.

256
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:33,594
Rym: well It wasn't even that GameStop went beyond that and did a very limited one and they put out fewer Pre-orders than they even expected in a bad case scenario.

257
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:39,104
Scott: for for PlayStation 3 Yeah I was hearing that they gave like an average like nine PS3s per store.

258
00:17:39,204 --> 00:17:46,487
Scott: of course stores in the middle of nowhere got maybe two ps3s or even one and stores in like a big city We get 20 30.

259
00:17:46,487 --> 00:17:49,740
Rym: Well, it turns out that that wasn't enough.

260
00:17:49,860 --> 00:18:02,034
Rym: There won't be enough ps3s to even fill those limited pre-orders and GameStop is now calling Their customers and telling them we know you gave us a hundred bucks But we can't give you a ps3 at least not right away.

261
00:18:02,134 --> 00:18:06,700
Scott: the if you have a pre-order You're probably gonna get one when they get one for you know what you get.

262
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:12,334
Rym: You know you get if you get dicked over by this a free used game or DVD valued it under 1999.

263
00:18:12,334 --> 00:18:23,080
Scott: Yeah When you eventually wind up purchasing the system So you can't even get it to like play in the time while you're waiting to get the ps3.

264
00:18:23,885 --> 00:18:25,765
Rym: No, no You gotta wait till you actually buy the ps3.

265
00:18:26,026 --> 00:18:34,959
Scott: you think they give you a nice used ps2 game to keep you from going crazy While you're waiting now because if that happened to me, I wouldn't go back to that GameStop to buy a ps3.

266
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:39,214
Rym: I'd be so angry that I would just freak out and make sure to that.

267
00:18:39,275 --> 00:18:40,459
Rym: I'd never went to that store again.

268
00:18:41,021 --> 00:18:41,744
Scott: Well, they don't.

269
00:18:42,046 --> 00:18:45,380
Scott: when they get the pre-order they they don't promise that you'll get one at launch.

270
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,363
Scott: They say this is not a.

271
00:18:46,383 --> 00:18:47,547
Rym: you know, what you know, what.

272
00:18:48,088 --> 00:18:49,392
Rym: that's horseshit.

273
00:18:49,914 --> 00:18:50,215
Scott: I know.

274
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:56,223
Scott: that's why when I went to the This guarantee me a unit at launch and they said yes It does

275
00:18:56,243 --> 00:19:03,360
Rym: like that episode of Seinfeld where he goes, you know He's like a reservation for a rental car and he goes and they're like, sorry, we don't have any cars But I have a reservation.

276
00:19:03,821 --> 00:19:07,372
Rym: Yeah, but we gave away all the cars and he went on this whole bit about.

277
00:19:07,854 --> 00:19:09,920
Rym: so doesn't that make the reservation kind of useless?

278
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:18,140
Scott: Yeah, but you know, it's what it is Is they have the legalese on there and if you want to buy a pre-order, you know.

279
00:19:18,401 --> 00:19:20,731
Scott: They tell you it's not a guarantee if you buy it.

280
00:19:20,811 --> 00:19:22,900
Rym: Anyway, you knew yeah, and you know what?

281
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,372
Rym: I hate to say it but I wouldn't I would never pre-order something that wasn't.

282
00:19:26,472 --> 00:19:28,600
Scott: I would never pre-order if it wasn't a guarantee either.

283
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,865
Scott: And that's why I asked.

284
00:19:29,946 --> 00:19:32,375
Scott: I said does this guarantee me something at launch?

285
00:19:32,496 --> 00:19:34,565
Scott: and if they say no It is not a guarantee.

286
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,237
Scott: I say I'm not buying it because I'm basically buying nothing.

287
00:19:37,639 --> 00:19:39,980
Rym: at least It was really easy to get a we pre-order.

288
00:19:40,261 --> 00:19:40,623
Scott: It was.

289
00:19:40,683 --> 00:19:44,340
Scott: I went to the Nintendo store right as soon as you know, people were talking about wheeze.

290
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,708
Scott: I said can I have a we pre-order?

291
00:19:45,748 --> 00:19:46,311
Scott: they said yes.

292
00:19:46,412 --> 00:19:47,780
Scott: I said does it guarantee me a unit?

293
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,329
Scott: They said yes, and I'm pretty sure if I go to the Nintendo store on Sunday I'm gonna take the first train in the morning.

294
00:19:53,489 --> 00:19:54,092
Scott: I'm gonna get away.

295
00:19:54,473 --> 00:19:54,634
Rym: Yep.

296
00:19:54,674 --> 00:19:56,140
Rym: I got a point 9%.

297
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:03,165
Rym: I got to figure out if my first we experience is going to be with Scott here in the geek house or with the other Scott in the Pennsylvania geek house.

298
00:20:03,546 --> 00:20:05,030
Scott: Hey don't care either way.

299
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,354
Scott: Ah, either way.

300
00:20:06,494 --> 00:20:06,996
Scott: I'm gonna be.

301
00:20:07,317 --> 00:20:08,560
Scott: we ended up on Sunday.

302
00:20:08,882 --> 00:20:10,012
Scott: Oh, yeah clean in the bathroom.

303
00:20:10,053 --> 00:20:12,385
Scott: on Saturday When I was playing Dragon

304
00:20:12,425 --> 00:20:13,689
Rym: Quest 8,

305
00:20:13,689 --> 00:20:16,418
Scott: I almost forced myself to go further because at

306
00:20:16,439 --> 00:20:21,700
Rym: the very end I had the secret thing and I beat all the secret things except one where you have to fight the seven previous

307
00:20:21,801 --> 00:20:24,419
Scott: bosses all at once with no rest in between.

308
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:30,100
Scott: and I looked it up on the internet and it's like yeah your prize for this is nothing.

309
00:20:31,345 --> 00:20:43,209
Rym: You go right back on the shelf Goodbye, oh you simply have to level up to 65 38 but just find some metal king slides.

310
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,513
Rym: No problem.

311
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,120
Rym: Yeah, we better find them on my bookshelf.

312
00:20:48,542 --> 00:20:50,838
Scott: That's the only place this game is gonna be for the next six.

313
00:20:50,858 --> 00:21:06,559
Rym: Well Dave and Joel's best karate for the gentleman the anime podcast for people who don't like M or Podcasts find us online at www.daveandjoe.com.

314
00:21:13,942 --> 00:21:15,046
Rym: So enough ps3.

315
00:21:15,086 --> 00:21:16,833
Rym: it's time for things of the day.

316
00:21:16,853 --> 00:21:17,737
Scott: Holy crap.

317
00:21:17,757 --> 00:21:18,520
Scott: What's your thing of the day?

318
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,339
Scott: I know what your thing of the day is because someone sent us the link and it was hilarious.

319
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:25,165
Rym: Yes Well, some of it was hilarious.

320
00:21:25,566 --> 00:21:30,040
Rym: Yeah, you see we all like Phoenix Wright, but I am now also a fan of Phoenix wrong.

321
00:21:31,561 --> 00:21:32,646
Scott: That's so creative.

322
00:21:32,706 --> 00:21:35,459
Scott: I never would have thought of that name for never in a million years.

323
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,538
Rym: God, but yeah, it's a bunch of little.

324
00:21:38,619 --> 00:21:59,980
Rym: now The thing is these are a lot like Photoshop Fridays on something awful in that It'll be the same kind of jokes over and over and over and all the jokes are basically Animations from Phoenix Wright with funny audio put over them and these are done by some different people Varying levels of skill and funniness and at least 60% of them are absolutely hilarious.

325
00:22:00,711 --> 00:22:12,542
Scott: Yeah I mean it seems like one guy started the trend of making Phoenix wrong videos and then a bunch of other people Sort of followed suit and some of them did a better job than the original guy and some of them did a worse job than The original.

326
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:14,791
Rym: yeah, like the last two on the site were pretty piss-poor.

327
00:22:14,851 --> 00:22:17,120
Scott: ever just fan crap total fan crap.

328
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:17,401
Scott: but

329
00:22:17,822 --> 00:22:35,332
Rym: like there's the one recurring theme that just really got me was there's this one thing von karma a guy near the end does Where he like bangs his fist on the ground and starts yelling and almost everyone used that and played some sort of air raid Siren or nuclear bomb exploding and it was always hilarious.

330
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:36,114
Scott: Yeah.

331
00:22:36,275 --> 00:22:36,836
Scott: Yeah, it was.

332
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:50,647
Scott: these are worth watching Yeah Yeah, so my thing today is a random webcomic I found today it's actually one specific Comic yeah in the web.

333
00:22:50,808 --> 00:22:54,326
Scott: I was trying to say issue or episode and I was like, no, it's not an issue It's not an episode.

334
00:22:54,347 --> 00:22:54,972
Scott: What are you talking about?

335
00:22:54,992 --> 00:22:57,663
Rym: It's a comic Sequential art.

336
00:22:57,984 --> 00:23:03,160
Scott: Yep, one specific comic of this webcomic was particularly hilarious.

337
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:08,483
Scott: It had a nice Zelda to joke and I was laughing for about four minutes so I made it my thing of the day.

338
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:14,629
Scott: now the comic is digital unrest by Chris Simmons and digital unrest.

339
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:19,734
Scott: comic comm Updates every Monday with video game jokes in the style of penny arcade.

340
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:21,260
Rym: Have you ever actually read this comic?

341
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,857
Scott: No, but I read this single comic of the digital unrest.

342
00:23:25,877 --> 00:23:26,660
Rym: You better watch out.

343
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,274
Rym: What if the rest of the comic isn't up to snuff for that one?

344
00:23:29,294 --> 00:23:30,038
Scott: All right, you're ready.

345
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:30,460
Scott: You're ready.

346
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,232
Scott: I'm gonna go and read one other digital one other one.

347
00:23:33,292 --> 00:23:33,714
Rym: All right.

348
00:23:33,854 --> 00:23:34,115
Rym: All right.

349
00:23:34,135 --> 00:23:34,477
Scott: Here we go.

350
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:34,738
Scott: You ready?

351
00:23:34,778 --> 00:23:35,685
Rym: I'm ready I'm ready.

352
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:36,676
Scott: Okay, let's see.

353
00:23:36,696 --> 00:23:38,181
Scott: Hold on Trouble.

354
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:39,587
Rym: just navigate the archive.

355
00:23:39,607 --> 00:23:40,249
Rym: It can't be that hard.

356
00:23:40,972 --> 00:23:42,016
Scott: the site's poorly designed.

357
00:23:42,097 --> 00:23:42,579
Scott: Oh, here we go.

358
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:43,504
Scott: I got one I got one.

359
00:23:44,148 --> 00:23:44,470
Scott: All right.

360
00:23:44,551 --> 00:23:59,940
Scott: I read a few comics of Digital unrest and most of them are just sort of crude video game related jokes that aren't too funny But there were two or three gems that I discovered in my cursory glance at the archives and the comics about a year old.

361
00:24:00,061 --> 00:24:05,952
Scott: So I wouldn't recommend Subscribing to this comic because I'm pretty picky about web web comics I subscribe to.

362
00:24:06,414 --> 00:24:09,324
Scott: but the one that I linked to is Hilarious.

363
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:10,309
Scott: so go for it.

364
00:24:10,611 --> 00:24:15,240
Rym: It's pretty funny mostly just because of the joke It makes not so much because of the way the joke was executed.

365
00:24:15,612 --> 00:24:22,363
Scott: Yeah I mean the problem is is that if you look at the third panel before you read the first panel you the joke is already Spoiled.

366
00:24:22,706 --> 00:24:31,625
Scott: they really should have made it one of those scroll down Instead of a horizontal one or they should have made the third panel less blaring, you know It's the same kind of joke.

367
00:24:31,705 --> 00:24:35,319
Rym: Is that Final Fantasy 4 comic that we laughed about a while ago?

368
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:39,312
Rym: Yeah, we're where someone kills themselves in a heroic fashion.

369
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:44,349
Scott: Yeah, it is the same kind of comic, but whatever Laugh today, so I'll give it.

370
00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:45,032
Scott: I'll give it a link.

371
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:45,534
Rym: Yeah.

372
00:24:45,554 --> 00:24:45,755
Rym: Yeah.

373
00:24:46,016 --> 00:24:46,880
Rym: I mean I'm the same way.

374
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:55,140
Rym: It's really hard for me to find a web comic I like and I've maybe read two web comics more than I used to read in the last several years.

375
00:24:55,661 --> 00:25:03,320
Scott: Well, I really a drop web comics because either they sucked and I just was reading them by habit or they stopped making new comics.

376
00:25:03,561 --> 00:25:05,852
Scott: It takes a lot takes a lot to pick one up.

377
00:25:06,013 --> 00:25:06,697
Scott: like dr.

378
00:25:06,737 --> 00:25:12,420
Scott: Mcninja I picked up in order to the stick that's about it and I picked up those a long time ago already.

379
00:25:12,681 --> 00:25:25,660
Rym: Yeah, so with all this, you know new age console stuff that really doesn't matter at all We figured it'd be time to review a much more Important and much more fun game than a lot of things that have come out recently.

380
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:30,280
Scott: Yeah, I mean everyone knows classic games like pac-man space invaders.

381
00:25:31,741 --> 00:25:36,178
Scott: Tetris I guess is kind of old, you know, but kind of old Tetris is fucking old.

382
00:25:36,278 --> 00:25:45,008
Scott: Yeah Mario but one guy that's sort of like the second tier of classic video games is Dig-dug dig-dug.

383
00:25:45,048 --> 00:25:49,596
Rym: See we I hadn't played dig-dug in Maybe five six seven years.

384
00:25:49,878 --> 00:26:02,760
Rym: Oh god I hadn't played dig-dug in forever, but we got the Atari 7800 hooked up in the living room and sadly enough We've been playing the 7800 more than we've been playing any other electronic game we own by far.

385
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:11,500
Scott: Well that changed when I started playing Resident Evil 4 a few days ago But before that we were playing dig-dug all the time now because you haven't put as many hours into Resident Evil 4.

386
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,609
Scott: I put 10 hours into Resident Evil 4 so far.

387
00:26:13,629 --> 00:26:15,256
Rym: Yeah, but we had the 7800 hooked up for a while.

388
00:26:16,562 --> 00:26:18,633
Scott: We did but I don't think I played dig-dug for 10 hours.

389
00:26:18,673 --> 00:26:19,960
Scott: You might have I don't know.

390
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,890
Rym: I don't think so and all those other games we were playing.

391
00:26:22,091 --> 00:26:26,029
Scott: I think we played it 10 times 15 Though you're kind of obsessing over Resident Evil 4.

392
00:26:26,029 --> 00:26:26,752
Rym: You won't let anyone.

393
00:26:26,892 --> 00:26:28,338
Rym: you won't let me use the living room.

394
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,508
Scott: Basically Well, you can use living room.

395
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:33,060
Rym: I can't play video games or use the TV.

396
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,788
Scott: How are you supposed to play video games while I'm playing video games?

397
00:26:35,949 --> 00:26:39,399
Rym: sink my iPod or use my 50% share of that TV.

398
00:26:40,884 --> 00:26:47,084
Scott: Well, first of all, you don't have a 50% share of that TV because most of that TV was paid for with my Sony points Whatever like my money.

399
00:26:47,866 --> 00:26:50,995
Scott: and second of all, I first come first serve.

400
00:26:51,055 --> 00:26:51,998
Scott: I'm playing video games.

401
00:26:52,038 --> 00:26:52,700
Scott: You can't stop me.

402
00:26:53,002 --> 00:26:55,583
Scott: Yeah, when I'm done playing video games You can do it everyone.

403
00:26:55,603 --> 00:27:00,404
Rym: when you play Resident Evil 4 most of what you do is sit there and bitch about the game while You play.

404
00:27:00,505 --> 00:27:02,579
Rym: well, I got how much you hate it and how stupid it is.

405
00:27:03,161 --> 00:27:04,345
Scott: You know the bitching for isn't?

406
00:27:04,366 --> 00:27:09,176
Scott: evil 4 is relatively less than some other games because if the bitching was more I would have put It down and bitch.

407
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,769
Scott: I would not have played for 10 hours sitting in the room with you.

408
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:17,700
Rym: you bitch the same amount that you've bitch for every single Game you've played for as long as you've lived in this house.

409
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:21,653
Rym: No, when you were playing Megaman X you bitch the exact same Megaman X.

410
00:27:21,854 --> 00:27:23,720
Scott: It depends on which Megaman X you're talking about.

411
00:27:23,881 --> 00:27:26,593
Rym: I'm talking about the frequency of bitching's per unit.

412
00:27:26,633 --> 00:27:28,040
Rym: time has remained constant.

413
00:27:28,383 --> 00:27:34,956
Rym: If you're playing a video game in the room You will bitch about every five minutes about something in the game being stupid and how.

414
00:27:35,016 --> 00:27:36,120
Rym: why would they make it that way?

415
00:27:36,441 --> 00:27:37,224
Rym: It could have been better.

416
00:27:37,244 --> 00:27:38,248
Rym: This is stupid.

417
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:39,614
Rym: Why do I have to do this?

418
00:27:39,975 --> 00:27:41,080
Rym: Why did they do it this way?

419
00:27:41,361 --> 00:27:42,765
Rym: This sucks, but you'll keep playing.

420
00:27:43,227 --> 00:27:44,330
Scott: Yeah, keep playing.

421
00:27:44,611 --> 00:27:45,133
Scott: keep playing.

422
00:27:45,374 --> 00:27:46,678
Scott: press a press a.

423
00:27:47,019 --> 00:28:05,680
Rym: okay Yeah, but of all the games for the 7800 which includes the entire 2600 library as well as the Atari equivalent of Tengen games No, God the ones we've been playing the most are miss pac-man Dig-dug dig-dug dig-dug miss pac-man super break out dig-dug pong.

424
00:28:06,422 --> 00:28:14,500
Rym: Well video Olympics video Olympics, which is pretty much every possible type of game that involves pong controls.

425
00:28:15,023 --> 00:28:16,795
Rym: Yep, it's kind of amazing.

426
00:28:16,835 --> 00:28:21,392
Rym: It's got basketball Volleyball hockey soccer tennis.

427
00:28:21,552 --> 00:28:23,640
Scott: I think the volleyball is my favorite racquetball.

428
00:28:24,983 --> 00:28:27,660
Rym: The foosball oh yeah foosball soccer.

429
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:31,500
Rym: So it's just pong and the paddles are in different places.

430
00:28:32,222 --> 00:28:33,827
Scott: All right, so dig-dug.

431
00:28:34,107 --> 00:28:42,980
Rym: dig-dug is one of those amazing old pure video games The it's I mean I word like pure a lot of times law pure collect blah blah blah.

432
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,052
Rym: But games like this really are pure.

433
00:28:45,132 --> 00:28:56,668
Rym: dig-dug is a game Where you dig into the ground and there are two kinds of monsters And you try to kill them in order to get as many points as you can Occasionally eating vegetables or galaxian flagships.

434
00:28:57,069 --> 00:29:01,220
Scott: yep, so basically a big duck can kill bad guys in two different ways.

435
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,452
Scott: You can either dig directly under a rock.

436
00:29:04,633 --> 00:29:09,209
Scott: if you dig directly under a rock And then you move the rock will fall down.

437
00:29:09,671 --> 00:29:13,284
Scott: if a bad guy happens to be there when the rock falls He will get squished.

438
00:29:13,766 --> 00:29:16,155
Scott: if dig-dug happens to be there when the rock falls.

439
00:29:16,437 --> 00:29:17,280
Scott: He will get squished.

440
00:29:17,361 --> 00:29:18,900
Rym: You know his name is not dig-dug right?

441
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,484
Scott: What's his name?

442
00:29:20,685 --> 00:29:23,480
Rym: I forget it now, but in Japan he was given a name.

443
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,808
Rym: He's also known as the hero of the something incident.

444
00:29:26,169 --> 00:29:30,624
Scott: his name is dig-dug and his name is not mr.. Driller Which you'll see a lot of.

445
00:29:30,664 --> 00:29:31,045
Scott: mr..

446
00:29:31,085 --> 00:29:32,771
Rym: Driller is has a name also.

447
00:29:32,831 --> 00:29:35,440
Scott: Yeah, but mr.. Driller is related to dig-dug in a way.

448
00:29:35,822 --> 00:29:43,840
Scott: You know they're like references that bind the two games together But anyway the other way dig-dug can be bad guys is by pumping them up full of air with his air pump.

449
00:29:44,071 --> 00:29:48,755
Rym: Yeah He shoves a spike into their body with an air pump and pumps it up until they explode.

450
00:29:48,775 --> 00:30:00,749
Scott: like imagine a bicycle pump With a big rope and a hook and he throws the hook into the bad guy, and then he pumps it up And you pump them four times and they explode.

451
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:01,972
Rym: now the monsters.

452
00:30:02,253 --> 00:30:05,924
Rym: there are two kinds of monsters pookas and Phi guys.

453
00:30:06,064 --> 00:30:07,107
Scott: Phi guards are awesome.

454
00:30:07,147 --> 00:30:09,694
Rym: Yeah pookas are just little red things that eat you.

455
00:30:09,915 --> 00:30:17,625
Rym: they have goggles that do nothing Yeah, the other ones are dragons that can breathe fire Horizontally and do so often.

456
00:30:17,845 --> 00:30:19,650
Scott: yeah, they both suck.

457
00:30:19,991 --> 00:30:23,720
Rym: now the cool thing is that both of them can also turn into a ghost form.

458
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,200
Rym: They call it something in Japan something like ghostly eyes.

459
00:30:26,681 --> 00:30:37,180
Rym: I forget yeah, but they can kind of phase like like an x-man Through the dirt very slowly and then pop out in your tunnels and try to eat.

460
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:42,437
Scott: Yeah, you see at the beginning of any round of dig-dug any level you know dig-dug himself will dig.

461
00:30:42,577 --> 00:30:43,760
Rym: his name's not dig-dug Whatever.

462
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,513
Scott: He'll dig from the top of the map straight down the middle into the middle of the board.

463
00:30:48,035 --> 00:30:53,680
Scott: all the bad guys are in these Little dugouts, it looks sort of like an ant ant farm thingy that you buy.

464
00:30:54,263 --> 00:30:57,720
Scott: And you know the bad guys are in the little dugouts, and they're just going back and forth.

465
00:30:58,241 --> 00:31:01,509
Scott: But the bad guys can't dig in the dirt like dig-dug can.

466
00:31:01,991 --> 00:31:05,720
Scott: so it's not easy for them to walk around on the dirt.

467
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:12,098
Scott: So they turn into eyeballs and float across the dirt to get to other areas where they can walk and thus kill dig-dug.

468
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,720
Scott: of course Turning into eyeballs they move through dirt a lot slower than they walk around.

469
00:31:16,861 --> 00:31:21,360
Rym: But you move through dirt a lot slower when you're digging than when you're running through a pre-dug tunnel.

470
00:31:21,662 --> 00:31:24,660
Rym: Mmm, and you know this is a pure old video game.

471
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:29,920
Rym: So you have two goals survive get points and the way they do points is cool.

472
00:31:29,981 --> 00:31:32,240
Rym: You get more points if you kill a bad guy down under.

473
00:31:32,742 --> 00:31:37,660
Rym: You get more points if you kill a fog are from the side because that way it's dangerous.

474
00:31:37,802 --> 00:31:38,878
Rym: He can flame you.

475
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:43,134
Rym: You get more points if you crush guys with rocks instead of pumping them up.

476
00:31:43,415 --> 00:31:46,525
Scott: you get a lot of points if you crush a Bunch of guys with one rock.

477
00:31:47,107 --> 00:31:59,360
Rym: as soon as you drop two boulders no matter where they are or when or whatever they hit something or not a vegetable or Galaxian ship or fruit or pineapple will appear and then you got to go grab it and it's worth a whole ton of points.

478
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,156
Scott: You've got like 10 seconds to grab the vegetable, and you know in the beginning of the game.

479
00:32:03,196 --> 00:32:04,160
Scott: What's the first vegetable?

480
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:08,035
Rym: It's like some crappy ass bean or whatever eventually turns into a galaxian ship.

481
00:32:08,096 --> 00:32:09,140
Rym: and finally a pineapple.

482
00:32:09,321 --> 00:32:10,208
Scott: Yeah, the pineapple.

483
00:32:10,308 --> 00:32:17,077
Scott: once you get to level 18 1920 It's a pineapple and it stays a pineapple forever and a pineapple is worth some godly amount of points.

484
00:32:17,097 --> 00:32:20,028
Rym: now by the way Digdog as Scott is calling him.

485
00:32:20,068 --> 00:32:23,602
Rym: his actual name is Taizo Hori, okay What's his name?

486
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:28,917
Rym: in America, and he is the father of Susumu Hori who is the main character in mr.. Driller.

487
00:32:28,937 --> 00:32:29,639
Rym: all right?

488
00:32:30,321 --> 00:32:31,465
Scott: What's Digdugs name in English?

489
00:32:31,685 --> 00:32:32,428
Rym: that is his name?

490
00:32:32,468 --> 00:32:33,010
Rym: That's his name.

491
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:33,792
Rym: No.

492
00:32:33,813 --> 00:32:36,000
Rym: I they didn't translator localized Digdug.

493
00:32:36,781 --> 00:32:37,845
Rym: Okay, all they'd all.

494
00:32:37,885 --> 00:32:38,808
Rym: the only part of that game.

495
00:32:38,828 --> 00:32:44,192
Rym: They translated is press starts players one to Pineapple or teddy bear.

496
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:48,924
Rym: yeah, yeah There's some puns in the name or something whatever.

497
00:32:48,944 --> 00:32:55,146
Rym: the the continuity of the Digdug universe is a little convoluted and It goes.

498
00:32:55,187 --> 00:32:59,169
Scott: I can't believe there's a Digdug universe Not only but there's.

499
00:32:59,209 --> 00:33:01,900
Rym: there's some trouble here because it's not all consistent.

500
00:33:02,523 --> 00:33:03,891
Rym: Oh really, and there are people.

501
00:33:03,931 --> 00:33:07,814
Scott: is it not consistent when the games contain No plot and therefore you could just make up the?

502
00:33:07,995 --> 00:33:08,539
Rym: I don't know.

503
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:12,256
Scott: They could have just made up a consistent plot with no game to interfere.

504
00:33:12,276 --> 00:33:20,266
Rym: now we've been playing this game a lot and the conclusion is simply that I am Infinitely better than Scott.

505
00:33:20,287 --> 00:33:21,673
Scott: you're not infinitely better.

506
00:33:21,813 --> 00:33:23,280
Scott: I'm damn good at Digdug.

507
00:33:23,561 --> 00:33:25,614
Scott: I just haven't been playing Digdug as much as you.

508
00:33:25,634 --> 00:33:29,435
Scott: you know my wife And I played a lot more Digdug 2 when I was a kid.

509
00:33:29,475 --> 00:33:30,380
Scott: then I played Digdug 1.

510
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,040
Rym: I could beat you Digdug 2 just as easily.

511
00:33:32,502 --> 00:33:33,746
Scott: I don't think you beat me Digdug 2.

512
00:33:33,746 --> 00:33:35,614
Rym: I played a lot of Digdug 2 as well.

513
00:33:35,654 --> 00:33:38,526
Scott: see I actually had Digdug 2 for the NES and I played it a lot.

514
00:33:38,566 --> 00:33:40,374
Scott: now Digdug 2 is a little different.

515
00:33:40,414 --> 00:33:43,105
Scott: you got the same Digdug But he's got the same pump.

516
00:33:43,286 --> 00:33:47,180
Scott: you got the Pookas and the Fygars right, but instead of digging under the earth.

517
00:33:47,521 --> 00:34:00,079
Scott: you're on an island and the island has like cracks in it and You know what there's these spikes and he has a jackhammer instead of a digging tool instead of whatever an automatic shovel or whatever Digdug uses.

518
00:34:00,099 --> 00:34:06,640
Scott: and If he goes to one of the spikes and uses the jackhammer he can put cracks in the island.

519
00:34:07,482 --> 00:34:08,385
Scott: Now what happens?

520
00:34:08,565 --> 00:34:18,676
Scott: if you put enough cracks in the island that break the island into different pieces like completely separate pieces The smaller piece will fall into the ocean like doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

521
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:21,560
Rym: ghostly eyes That's what they're called anyway.

522
00:34:21,741 --> 00:34:28,103
Scott: Okay, so if there happened to be Pookas and Fygars on the piece that falls into the ocean Awesome.

523
00:34:28,685 --> 00:34:30,730
Scott: if there aren't that sucks.

524
00:34:31,091 --> 00:34:34,760
Scott: if Digdug is on the part that falls into the ocean that sucks.

525
00:34:35,442 --> 00:34:45,297
Scott: So it's all about looking at the map and breaking up the island in a way that makes the bad guys fall off the edge And if you get in trouble you can always pump them up with the pump air thingy.

526
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:59,019
Rym: now I got to say I have a very special tender place in my heart for all of these old or even new just pure video games games that have a very simple very direct concept and they implement it as well as they can.

527
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:04,660
Rym: and The only factor here is how good are you at this specific pure game?

528
00:35:05,343 --> 00:35:07,799
Rym: It is a direct contest of digging and dugging.

529
00:35:08,602 --> 00:35:15,400
Scott: The best thing about these games is that there's so many nuances that aren't immediately obvious that you have to learn over time.

530
00:35:15,521 --> 00:35:17,148
Scott: You know to the untrained eye.

531
00:35:17,168 --> 00:35:19,760
Scott: you look at this game and you say what the hell is that shit?

532
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:20,799
Scott: There's nothing to this game.

533
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:31,660
Rym: Yeah Sit down with someone who knows what they're doing and watch them play on a difficult level and you'll see a situation Where there's like eight monsters going after you and you're in the corner and you think this guy's gonna die.

534
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:41,201
Rym: There's no way you can survive this and they'll do some kind of kung fu Like I'll make a little path go around back stun a bunch of guys run away catch a rock kill them all grab the mushroom And win.

535
00:35:41,904 --> 00:35:51,160
Scott: Yeah, it's like you see people playing games like Soul Calibur and they pull off some awesome combo and you go Whoa, and you don't think that kind of thing is possible in some simple game like Dig Dug?

536
00:35:51,301 --> 00:35:53,074
Scott: Well, it's very possible.

537
00:35:53,134 --> 00:35:55,859
Scott: in a game like Dig Dug We pull off awesome moves all the time.

538
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,215
Scott: You know Like you'll be standing there with guys coming at you from all the directions.

539
00:36:00,256 --> 00:36:12,437
Scott: you do some daring Digging and you you know, you're like pump up some guys a little bit But not not enough so that they die to keep them there to delay them just a little bit that the rock hits them Instead of them running away from the rock

540
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:12,720
Rym: course.

541
00:36:13,001 --> 00:36:17,999
Rym: My favorite thing that you did was in one game in level one you walk to the right and were immediately killed.

542
00:36:18,592 --> 00:36:18,737
Scott: What?

543
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,367
Scott: Yeah, it's gonna happen.

544
00:36:21,407 --> 00:36:23,700
Rym: Sometimes that's like dying on the first goomba.

545
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:30,786
Scott: Yeah, you know if I play Mario 1 a hundred times maybe a thousand times one out of a thousand times I might hit that first goomba.

546
00:36:30,927 --> 00:36:34,905
Rym: Well, you know, I got to make fun of you because you know according to the listeners I'm really too hard on you.

547
00:36:34,945 --> 00:36:36,611
Rym: So I got to keep up this persona.

548
00:36:37,033 --> 00:36:39,000
Scott: You've also died in level one of Dig Dug.

549
00:36:39,542 --> 00:36:40,144
Rym: You know what though.

550
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:42,994
Rym: when I died in level one, I already had like 2,000 points.

551
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:47,906
Rym: you had 10.

552
00:36:47,906 --> 00:36:48,435
Scott: What do you want?

553
00:36:49,321 --> 00:36:52,228
Scott: The other thing is like a bunch of levels in Dig Dug.

554
00:36:52,329 --> 00:36:54,976
Scott: I've done perfectly but I don't remember the.

555
00:36:55,537 --> 00:36:56,700
Scott: it's a deterministic game.

556
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:01,306
Scott: So if you do the exact same input every time You know, I mean other games.

557
00:37:01,366 --> 00:37:04,740
Scott: it's not easy to do the exact same input because the games are so complex.

558
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,603
Rym: In Dig Dug it is.

559
00:37:05,663 --> 00:37:07,249
Rym: There are a lot of the levels.

560
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:10,320
Rym: I'll play in the exact same way every time.

561
00:37:10,621 --> 00:37:20,710
Rym: I'll like wait two seconds walk to the right open into the monster's pit stun him once walk down walk Right, wait two more seconds go across the rock and kill three guys.

562
00:37:21,171 --> 00:37:22,917
Scott: Yeah, you can't do that sort of thing in.

563
00:37:23,098 --> 00:37:25,184
Scott: I don't know Mario 64.

564
00:37:25,184 --> 00:37:26,889
Rym: No, but like Mario 1 you can.

565
00:37:27,069 --> 00:37:27,932
Scott: Mario 1 you definitely can.

566
00:37:27,952 --> 00:37:28,674
Rym: Mario 2 you can.

567
00:37:28,694 --> 00:37:29,175
Rym: Yep.

568
00:37:29,797 --> 00:37:30,760
Rym: Mario 3 you can too.

569
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,867
Scott: Mostly mostly it's not.

570
00:37:32,887 --> 00:37:40,659
Scott: it won't be a hundred percent the same as the last time you played it But in Dig Dug you can play a hundred percent the same every time and it'd be pretty cool.

571
00:37:40,699 --> 00:37:47,455
Scott: now I just want to point out that I downloaded I got Maim, you know to play the arcade the original arcade version of Dig Dug.

572
00:37:47,475 --> 00:37:48,980
Rym: Yeah, we've been playing the real Dig Dug.

573
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,140
Rym: We've been playing the 7800 version which actually is a very good port.

574
00:37:53,381 --> 00:37:55,673
Scott: It's a very close to the original version.

575
00:37:56,035 --> 00:38:03,960
Scott: the NES version However is basically nine, you know, I say the arcade version of course is a hundred percent identical to what Dig Dug is supposed to be.

576
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,146
Rym: Well, it's a hundred percent identical to itself.

577
00:38:06,246 --> 00:38:06,668
Scott: Exactly.

578
00:38:06,688 --> 00:38:07,530
Rym: That's your argument.

579
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:14,409
Scott: Yes, the Atari 7800 version is about 90% identical to the arcade.

580
00:38:14,449 --> 00:38:16,114
Rym: It's a little bit slower.

581
00:38:16,134 --> 00:38:24,559
Scott: It's a little bit easier You know, there's less resolution and the bad guys are a little bit dumber even though I think they have the same AI.

582
00:38:25,423 --> 00:38:28,099
Scott: Some of the pictures of the flowers are different stuff like that.

583
00:38:28,521 --> 00:38:33,080
Scott: The NES version is ninety nine point nine nine nine percent similar to the arcade version.

584
00:38:33,461 --> 00:38:39,660
Scott: So if you're gonna play this game by some emulation or something, it's probably easiest to get the NES version.

585
00:38:39,841 --> 00:38:40,932
Scott: It's probably the nicest version.

586
00:38:40,953 --> 00:38:48,760
Rym: Well, especially MAME is a little bit difficult sometimes for people who don't want to spend time fiddling with it to get to work.

587
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:53,440
Scott: Yeah, MAME is not is the easiest emulator to make because you're emulating all this different hardware.

588
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:58,400
Rym: It's not like an NES emulator where you're emulating the NES and maybe some MMCs and that's it.

589
00:38:58,661 --> 00:39:00,909
Scott: Yeah, MAME isn't difficult just on its own.

590
00:39:00,949 --> 00:39:08,060
Scott: It's just more difficult than something like ZSNES or What are those rock NES or any of those other NES emulators?

591
00:39:08,483 --> 00:39:10,275
Scott: Which are very very very easy to use.

592
00:39:10,899 --> 00:39:22,260
Rym: and We talked about Dig Dug today mostly because we were gonna review Resident Evil 4 but Scott Wouldn't put down the GameCube controller long enough for me to actually play the game.

593
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,927
Scott: Well, I found I'm almost done with the game.

594
00:39:24,008 --> 00:39:26,740
Scott: Actually, I've only got like eight chapters to go.

595
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,700
Scott: So yeah, I should beat it pretty soon.

596
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:36,679
Rym: You know We missed the window because the Wii is gonna come out and then we're not gonna have a chance for me to play Resident Evil 4 for at least another three or four years.

597
00:39:37,442 --> 00:39:38,405
Scott: But you'll play.

598
00:39:38,485 --> 00:39:51,965
Rym: no no because look all the way on the Wii all these DS and Wii games are gonna be coming out at a pretty steady rate for a while and I already have a backlog of DS games to play let alone my other backlogs and We're playing D&D again.

599
00:39:51,985 --> 00:39:56,300
Rym: Yeah, so I don't think I'm gonna get to Resident Evil 4 for a long time.

600
00:39:56,541 --> 00:40:01,838
Rym: I'll be playing the Resident Evils on like the DS 365 years from now.

601
00:40:02,643 --> 00:40:06,880
Scott: No, I'm gonna play this Saturday, you know because I'm going to get the Wii on Sunday.

602
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:17,109
Scott: So this Saturday if I don't beat Resident Evil 4 this Saturday, I don't think I'm ever gonna beat it Now maybe when you're an old man, maybe when I'm an old man I'll go back and there'll be a box set.

603
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:25,200
Scott: It'll be all of Resident Evil on a single Hollow foil and I'll play all ten Resident Evil games on the single hollow foil.

604
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:28,055
Rym: Honestly, I don't like any other Resident Evil games.

605
00:40:28,478 --> 00:40:31,773
Scott: Yeah Well, I'll talk about it, but that'll save it for the Resident Evil episode.

606
00:40:31,814 --> 00:40:34,422
Rym: Yeah, which in a few years We'll talk about Resident Evil.
