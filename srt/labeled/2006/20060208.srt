00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,730
Rym: It's Wednesday, February 8th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:19,250
Rym: Tonight we talk about Ninku and Masuda Kosuke Theater, gag manga Biore.

3
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,089
Scott: Let's do this!

4
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:33,289
Rym: Man, I had a meeting today at work, and all I have to say is that it seems like most adults in this world don't know how to, uh, actually confront each other or talk about problems in an adult professional manner.

5
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,906
Scott: It's because they forgot how to talk?

6
00:00:36,967 --> 00:00:37,309
Scott: I don't know.

7
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,517
Rym: It's just, it's kind of annoying.

8
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:55,209
Rym: I sat through a meeting, and I can't really get into the details, but basically, a lot of companies will have managers, like they'll have an anonymous survey where you rate how well your manager's doing, blah blah blah, and then the manager gets, like, these statistics of, well, some people say this and some people say this.

9
00:00:55,862 --> 00:00:56,030
Rym: Alright.

10
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,597
Rym: And it's supposed to help teamwork and whatever.

11
00:00:58,922 --> 00:01:14,502
Rym: So, uh, imagine if your manager gets that, and then you have a meeting, and you gotta sit there while the manager talks about the results of the survey, and then all the people want to give their criticism to the manager without actually criticizing the managers.

12
00:01:14,582 --> 00:01:23,526
Rym: Everyone's kind of dancing around the issue, and everyone keeps saying things like, "Oh, well, not to speak of you specifically, but in general, blah blah blah blah blah

13
00:01:23,546 --> 00:01:23,828
Rym: blah.".

14
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:24,973
Scott: Mm-hmm.

15
00:01:25,971 --> 00:01:27,099
Rym: It was just, it was painful.

16
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,750
Rym: I just, I, I, oh my God.

17
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,729
Scott: Why didn't you just say this and this and this and this and this?

18
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,704
Rym: 'Cause I have no problems with my manager.

19
00:01:32,724 --> 00:01:33,490
Rym: At all.

20
00:01:34,036 --> 00:01:35,350
Scott: But why do these people have problems?

21
00:01:36,293 --> 00:01:42,361
Rym: Uh, honestly, the funniest thing was that the biggest complaint people seem to have in a lot of companies is that they're not appreciated.

22
00:01:43,184 --> 00:01:48,369
Rym: And they want, like, in these intangibles, like, someone to just tell me I did a good job or appreciate me.

23
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,937
Rym: And that's not something I can relate to.

24
00:01:51,097 --> 00:01:53,870
Rym: Honestly, if you appreciate me, give me more money.

25
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,596
Rym: That's all I care about.

26
00:01:55,918 --> 00:02:01,530
Rym: If you'll pay me $100,000 a year to sit on my ass in an office doing nothing, I'll take the money, and I'll work on something else.

27
00:02:01,973 --> 00:02:04,449
Rym: But money is the only reason I'm at my job.

28
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:11,830
Scott: Yeah, I get plenty of money, but the thing is, it's like, sitting there all day doing nothing.

29
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:17,570
Scott: It's like, sometimes I feel like, you know, I should be doing something 'cause they're paying me.

30
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,390
Rym: See, here's the way I look at it.

31
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,190
Scott: And then, if they don't pay attention to me, it's like, why are they paying me?

32
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:29,508
Scott: And it's not so much that I'm bothered, that, you know, I don't have to do any work, or that, you know, there isn't a whole lot of work to do.

33
00:02:31,533 --> 00:02:34,030
Scott: It's just like this, hmm, what are they thinking?

34
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,447
Scott: It's all weird and mysterious, and it's kind of like, ooh.

35
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:42,990
Rym: Well, see, to me, if I'm sitting, like, say I end up with a few hours with nothing to do at work at all.

36
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,215
Rym: Like, absolutely nothing.

37
00:02:44,718 --> 00:02:45,341
Rym: For whatever reason.

38
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:47,110
Rym: Maybe I'm waiting for someone's crap or whatever.

39
00:02:48,232 --> 00:02:50,330
Rym: I'll spend that time just learning about something.

40
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,033
Scott: Oh, okay.

41
00:02:51,153 --> 00:02:52,097
Scott: Yeah, that's one thing.

42
00:02:52,157 --> 00:02:56,417
Scott: If, like, on a day of work I have a few hours with nothing to do, that's, you know, obvious.

43
00:02:56,437 --> 00:03:01,350
Scott: It's like, oh, I finished something, you know, but then I have to wait for something to happen, so I've got a few hours.

44
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,589
Scott: And I'd feel fine doing whatever I want during those hours, you know?

45
00:03:05,191 --> 00:03:07,750
Scott: But what if it's weeks and weeks and weeks and there's nothing?

46
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:19,850
Rym: I had that happen a lot when I worked for RIT's IT department, because most of my job was scheduling things and then doing those things, and I had no responsibilities outside of doing those scheduled things.

47
00:03:20,631 --> 00:03:26,539
Rym: So I had weeks at a time where, other than a couple of appointments here and there, they were paying me to just do nothing.

48
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,769
Rym: I just did my homework, or I slept, or...

49
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:41,623
Scott: When it was a full-time job, you did it all day, every day, and for weeks upon weeks, no one really paid attention to you or asked you what you were doing or gave you anything to do or asked anything of you or did anything for you.

50
00:03:41,663 --> 00:03:42,909
Scott: You just sat there and...

51
00:03:44,011 --> 00:03:55,550
Rym: Honestly, if that actually happened to me and I had a job like that, I'd probably be generally looking for a job elsewhere, just in case, because I'd be worried that they were going to fire me, and that's why they weren't giving me any work.

52
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,830
Scott: And then they give you more money and move you to a new office.

53
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,437
Rym: You know what?

54
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,150
Rym: That's fine.

55
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:04,870
Scott: Yeah, but it's like I feel bad if I start working on something else.

56
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,557
Scott: And I do kind of have work to do.

57
00:04:06,617 --> 00:04:08,786
Scott: It's like I got this one thing to do.

58
00:04:08,826 --> 00:04:11,389
Scott: that's so trivial, it's like I don't even want to look at it.

59
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:23,309
Scott: And I have this other thing to do where I 99% finished it, and I just have to fix one bug and it's done, and it's just like I really don't feel like doing it, because if I did it, there would be one less thing I have to do in my queue.

60
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:28,790
Scott: And then I have this giant project, which I want to work on, but they haven't given me the final spec.

61
00:04:29,011 --> 00:04:38,149
Scott: And I've already read all the documentation they've given me and already know everything there is to know about it, short of the actual instructions about what they really want me to do.

62
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:44,850
Scott: And no one's talked to me about it since giving me... They basically just gave me the documentation and haven't said a thing about it since.

63
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:49,170
Rym: See, that's the one thing that does get to me, is a lot of times I'll have work I could do.

64
00:04:49,431 --> 00:04:54,430
Rym: I'm all ready to do something, but I'm waiting for some idiot somewhere else to get their act together before I can do it.

65
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,530
Scott: See, the real problem here isn't the fact that I'm waiting.

66
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:09,889
Scott: It would be fine if I knew that, say, someone was planning to give me the stuff I needed, and I was just waiting for them to do it, because then they'd be like, "Okay, I'm stuck here waiting for this guy, and I would feel just fine working on my own

67
00:05:09,929 --> 00:05:10,230
Scott: whatever.".

68
00:05:11,931 --> 00:05:16,125
Scott: But when they haven't even communicated anything to me at all, they didn't say, "We're going to get it to

69
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:16,267
Scott: you.".

70
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:17,476
Scott: They didn't say, "It's

71
00:05:17,556 --> 00:05:17,918
Scott: coming.".

72
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,749
Scott: They didn't say, "You're going to do this, you're going to do

73
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:19,890
Scott: that.".

74
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,237
Scott: They just said absolutely nothing.

75
00:05:21,298 --> 00:05:22,383
Scott: No words whatsoever.

76
00:05:22,403 --> 00:05:23,610
Scott: I have no information.

77
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,515
Scott: All I have is these documents.

78
00:05:25,536 --> 00:05:26,862
Scott: They said, "You have a new project.

79
00:05:26,882 --> 00:05:27,083
Scott: Here's

80
00:05:27,123 --> 00:05:27,585
Scott: documents.".

81
00:05:29,194 --> 00:05:29,527
Scott: That's it.

82
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:33,429
Rym: Well, I mean, at least thank yourself that you're not in IT.

83
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:44,369
Rym: Because a lot of IT work, if you're just a system administrator, you're not going to do a lot of proactive work, because once all that's done, if there isn't a project on the horizon, there's not much to do.

84
00:05:45,173 --> 00:05:50,549
Rym: So you honestly spend a lot of your time kind of sitting around, being ready to deal with things if they break.

85
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:59,689
Scott: But see, that's fine, because then at least I would know for sure my job is to sit around and wait for things to break, which means I'm not supposed to be doing anything now.

86
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:04,169
Scott: But it feels like I'm supposed to be doing something, but I'm not sure, or maybe...

87
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:07,310
Rym: Well, I guess my take on that is that there have been many times...

88
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:13,849
Scott: It's like the fact that I could have finished some of these things that I'm doing, like the thing that I'm 99% done with, I probably could have finished it weeks upon weeks ago.

89
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:21,450
Scott: The fact that no one seems to care that it's not done, and no one's even asked about it, is like... Does it not matter?

90
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:29,650
Rym: What often scares me is when I'll finish a project, and I think I've done it really slowly and terribly, like I just kind of put a half-ass into it, like I didn't do a good job.

91
00:06:30,272 --> 00:06:31,690
Rym: Or it took way longer than it should have.

92
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:35,466
Rym: And people still praise me like, "Wow, that was awesome, none of us could have done

93
00:06:35,486 --> 00:06:35,687
Rym: that.".

94
00:06:36,835 --> 00:06:36,919
Scott: Wow.

95
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,029
Rym: Yeah, my job's kind of interesting sometimes.

96
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:44,569
Scott: But I think the people at my work know how long it takes to do stuff.

97
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,190
Scott: They're not really amazed or anything.

98
00:06:47,471 --> 00:06:51,189
Rym: I'll freely admit that the people at my work have no idea how long things should take to do.

99
00:06:52,372 --> 00:06:54,949
Scott: I mean, the stuff that I've finished, they said, "Yeah, you did a good job,".

100
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:59,150
Scott: because I did do a good job, you know, I took my time and did things right.

101
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:17,789
Scott: I wasn't in a big rush or anything, but... You know, they don't seem to... I don't know why they're paying me, and they seem to think highly of me, and they're nice to me, but I don't understand why they keep paying me more, because I don't feel my work is really... I don't think I do anything valuable to them.

102
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,529
Scott: I think I just take their money from them.

103
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:26,748
Rym: Honestly, in America, I'm pretty sure that our entire economy is based on the fact that everyone does things really inefficiently.

104
00:07:27,372 --> 00:07:30,550
Rym: And if any company actually did things efficiently, there wouldn't be any jobs.

105
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,230
Scott: Yeah, but I mean, I could do my job.

106
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:44,370
Rym: I mean, I honestly, aside from some of the application development, I'd say I've met at least 40 or 50 people in the course of the last year working where I work.

107
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:49,089
Rym: People who just don't need to exist and their job could be done by a computer or by me in my spare time.

108
00:07:50,430 --> 00:08:01,010
Scott: Yeah, but it's like, if I really wanted to, really, and I had the specs for the project, I could finish that project in maybe a month, you know, if I did it really well, maybe.

109
00:08:02,251 --> 00:08:06,050
Scott: And I could do the stuff, you know, the other two things I have to do in like a day.

110
00:08:06,472 --> 00:08:07,236
Scott: Just like, oof, they're done.

111
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:09,346
Scott: And then I had nothing to do.

112
00:08:09,848 --> 00:08:10,150
Scott: At all.

113
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,618
Rym: I guess don't look a gift horse in the mouth.

114
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:15,250
Rym: I mean, there are people who would kill to have a job like that.

115
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,410
Scott: Yeah, but I sit alone in this office all day like banging my head against the wall.

116
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:18,752
Scott: What do you mean?

117
00:08:18,772 --> 00:08:21,930
Rym: You sit alone in your office all day instant messaging me while I'm trying to do work.

118
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:26,470
Scott: Because I had nothing else to do to keep me from going insane, sitting in this empty office.

119
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:27,533
Rym: You know what?

120
00:08:27,754 --> 00:08:30,250
Rym: Most people sit in that office for the rest of their lives.

121
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:34,909
Scott: Yeah, I'm going to get out of this office as soon as I drain enough money out of it.

122
00:08:35,493 --> 00:08:37,950
Rym: Yeah, or maybe GeekNights will become popular and syndicated.

123
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:42,429
Scott: I don't think so, but, you know, it's kind of like a Puerto Rico game, you know?

124
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:48,049
Scott: You gotta keep using this small market until I get enough doubloons to buy the university, then I'm outta here.

125
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:53,070
Rym: So anyway, tell us about Songbird, Scott.

126
00:08:54,752 --> 00:08:58,970
Scott: So, we all know about Firefox, Thunderbird, and what's the other one?

127
00:08:59,494 --> 00:09:00,067
Scott: Oh, I don't know.

128
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:00,850
Scott: Sunbird, I think.

129
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:01,730
Rym: Sunbird, yeah, whatever.

130
00:09:01,991 --> 00:09:03,150
Scott: Yeah, it's the one with the calendar.

131
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:05,235
Scott: Anyway, there's a new one.

132
00:09:05,255 --> 00:09:09,910
Scott: I don't think it's actually made by Mozilla, but if it turns out to be good, Mozilla will probably absorb it.

133
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,510
Scott: It's called Songbird.

134
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:17,610
Scott: It's basically iTunes built on the Firefox engine.

135
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,130
Scott: But it's not actually iTunes, it's an iTunes replacement.

136
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,788
Rym: Now, I'll warn you guys right now that this isn't a finished product at all.

137
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,444
Scott: Yeah, this is like version .1 alpha something.

138
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,761
Scott: It's not really useful yet.

139
00:09:29,882 --> 00:09:30,729
Scott: I wouldn't use it.

140
00:09:31,132 --> 00:09:33,710
Rym: All I can say about it is that it looks like it has potential.

141
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,330
Scott: Yeah.

142
00:09:34,871 --> 00:09:45,170
Scott: If you go, it looks like black iTunes, and on the left side of the screen, you've got links to pretty much every source of music other than, you know, iTunes.

143
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:49,147
Rym: You know, yeah, like every podcast aggregator, Amazon, everything.

144
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:59,870
Scott: In the middle there, you've got basically what amounts to a Firefox web browser, but it's very trimmed down, so you just like view controls for things in it, you know?

145
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:04,590
Scott: And the websites that you buy music from, just like iTunes, you know, the music store.

146
00:10:04,911 --> 00:10:06,890
Scott: It appears in this big kind of browser-y window.

147
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:12,050
Scott: And then in the menus, it obviously plays music.

148
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:15,410
Scott: It can play all kinds of music, any audio files and whatever.

149
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:26,370
Scott: And at the top, there's controls to like create smart playlists and manage your audio library and, you know, handle any devices you have.

150
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,289
Scott: I don't think that works yet.

151
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,209
Rym: Nothing seems to really work so well.

152
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:37,270
Rym: In fact, I recall earlier you told me you were going to show it to me, and then it opened off the screen and you couldn't get it back.

153
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:42,250
Scott: Well, I think that was partly because I was using two monitors at work, but it's also partly because of the program.

154
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:46,149
Scott: But, yeah, it's also big and slow right now.

155
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:48,549
Rym: I guess keep an eye on it and give it time.

156
00:10:49,171 --> 00:10:52,950
Rym: I'd really like to see something to compete with iTunes that would actually work well.

157
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:59,670
Scott: Yeah, I think if this, if they come out, this is Mozilla Zool stuff, so there's no reason it shouldn't run on all the platforms.

158
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:15,390
Scott: If they can really get some Firefox-style quality in there, I think they can beat iTunes, especially if they have, you know, proper MP3 player and iPod support and proper podcast-subscribing action and library management.

159
00:11:15,831 --> 00:11:18,090
Scott: If they can get those three things, they can really take over.

160
00:11:19,252 --> 00:11:21,470
Rym: All right, so in other news, NASA.

161
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:22,350
Scott: NASA.

162
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,693
Scott: Anyway... Oh, '58.

163
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,370
Rym: Yes, that, dear listeners, was an inside joke.

164
00:11:30,311 --> 00:11:32,730
Scott: You'll find out about it later, if you don't know it already.

165
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:43,750
Rym: Yeah, we're probably going to make it a thing of the day, because it's funny how sometimes a thing or a joke, or just a thing we see on the internet, we'll be immune to it and it'll disappear and we'll forget about it.

166
00:11:44,191 --> 00:11:50,970
Rym: But sometimes, we just latch onto something and quote it infinitely for, you know, a year or two, and then we forget about it.

167
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:52,348
Scott: All right, so NASA.

168
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,127
Scott: Yeah, NASA.

169
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:53,629
Scott: The real NASA.

170
00:11:54,170 --> 00:12:00,450
Rym: So, uh, George C. Deutsch of NASA was not the best dude.

171
00:12:00,911 --> 00:12:04,210
Rym: He was working for NASA, and he was a very high-up kind of guy there.

172
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,350
Rym: He had the power to squelch research and direct scientists and that sort of thing.

173
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,070
Scott: What was the name of his position?

174
00:12:10,892 --> 00:12:19,590
Rym: So, our good friend George was appointed by our other good friend George, as in George Bush, as a writer and editor, a presidential appointee at NASA.

175
00:12:20,911 --> 00:12:29,890
Rym: And, one, he claimed to have graduated from Texas A&M, which actually was discovered by some bloggers to be a falsehood, if you will.

176
00:12:30,231 --> 00:12:32,209
Scott: He dropped out of Texas A&M.

177
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:39,050
Rym: Yes, in fact, he dropped out, if I may, to work on George W. Bush's election campaign.

178
00:12:39,762 --> 00:12:40,110
Rym: Mm-hmm.

179
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,690
Rym: Huh, fancy that, and then somehow he got appointed to NASA.

180
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,290
Scott: Maybe I should join some people's election campaigns so I can get appointed to things.

181
00:12:46,575 --> 00:12:46,850
Scott: Yeah.

182
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:48,027
Scott: I think I'll do that.

183
00:12:48,990 --> 00:13:05,230
Rym: So, he lied about having a degree, and this probably wouldn't have mattered, except that he brought a bunch of attention to himself when, among other things, he was trying to muzzle James Hansen, a scientist at NASA, concerning his research on global warming and the fact that it's actually happening.

184
00:13:05,491 --> 00:13:13,070
Scott: So, as writing and editing, he edited and wrote things that concealed or did not include research which NASA was doing?

185
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:18,070
Rym: Yeah, that, and it looks like he was trying to, all right, not let this guy publish his papers, period.

186
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:18,872
Scott: Mm-hmm.

187
00:13:18,892 --> 00:13:22,130
Scott: Well, I guess, does he have to publish them through the NASA public, whatever office?

188
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:22,835
Rym: Yeah, I really don't know.

189
00:13:22,855 --> 00:13:24,770
Rym: I don't know much about the inner workings of NASA.

190
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:35,210
Scott: I mean, I went to space camp when I was a little kid, and that seems to me like this guy was sort of like a middleman for people in NASA trying to publish his papers.

191
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,310
Scott: He published things to the public somewhere.

192
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,289
Rym: Yeah, something like that.

193
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,290
Scott: Yeah, and he edited and wrote.

194
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:47,810
Rym: Also, he was trying to force the web designers to add the word "theory" every single time the Big Bang was mentioned.

195
00:13:48,392 --> 00:13:48,642
Scott: Mm-hmm.

196
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:52,370
Rym: And he tried to cover up various research into the Big Bang.

197
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,015
Scott: Can we frickin' leave?

198
00:13:54,196 --> 00:13:55,484
Scott: Theory means awesome.

199
00:13:55,826 --> 00:13:56,430
Scott: God damn it.

200
00:13:56,911 --> 00:14:01,466
Rym: Yeah, but he doesn't like the fact, apparently, that Big Bang is asserted as a fact.

201
00:14:01,486 --> 00:14:02,610
Rym: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

202
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,290
Rym: It's no different than the intelligent design bollocks going on.

203
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,354
Scott: God damn it.

204
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:10,110
Scott: The colloquial meaning of the word "theory" is not equal to the scientific meaning.

205
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,417
Scott: The scientific meaning means, "Holy crap, it's a theory, it's

206
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:13,778
Scott: true."

207
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,367
Scott: And the colloquial meaning is, "In theory...".

208
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:31,810
Rym: So basically, the short version of this is that this guy dropped out of college, was appointed by Bush to NASA, used by Bush in NASA to cover up research that went against what the administration was trying to do, and then he got caught and was forced to resign.

209
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,661
Scott: Isn't he just like a 23, 24-year-old guy?

210
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,150
Rym: He's a 24-year-old punk who didn't graduate from college.

211
00:14:37,371 --> 00:14:38,588
Scott: So he's about as old as we are.

212
00:14:39,351 --> 00:14:48,070
Scott: I think I read somewhere that he pretty much went from writing for the college newspaper articles about video games to being the NASA guy.

213
00:14:48,712 --> 00:14:54,690
Rym: Well, in the fart thread about this, people pointed out a lot of other interesting appointments Bush has made in his tenure.

214
00:14:55,252 --> 00:14:55,590
Rym: Oh, really?

215
00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:00,210
Rym: And he's appointed a lot of young punk kids to very high-level positions in our government.

216
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:01,174
Scott: Really?

217
00:15:01,558 --> 00:15:02,850
Scott: Maybe that's why things suck.

218
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,130
Scott: Yeah, that might be hard.

219
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:04,690
Scott: What was that guy who...

220
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:05,838
Rym: Well, I mean, look at recent ones.

221
00:15:06,623 --> 00:15:07,670
Rym: Brown, the head of FEMA.

222
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,789
Scott: Yeah, I was just gonna say him.

223
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:14,890
Rym: That guy was an expert in horses, and yet he ended up being the disaster manager of the whole country.

224
00:15:15,892 --> 00:15:16,749
Rym: Yeah, way to go there.

225
00:15:17,112 --> 00:15:19,328
Rym: We saw what a colossal fuck-up he was.

226
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:24,970
Rym: Harriet Meyers, he tried to get on the Supreme Court, who had absolutely no experience whatsoever.

227
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:26,090
Scott: As a judge, at least.

228
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:26,177
Scott: Yeah.

229
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,269
Scott: She was a lawyer, which is close.

230
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:32,750
Rym: Granted, honestly, very few Supreme Court justices were actually judges at any point before being on the court.

231
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,570
Scott: Yeah, she was at least a lawyer, so that was something, but it was his personal lawyer.

232
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,670
Rym: It was his personal lawyer.

233
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:40,110
Scott: That's like me trying to make my physician the surgeon general.

234
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:40,954
Rym: Yeah.

235
00:15:41,851 --> 00:15:42,195
Scott: Yeah.

236
00:15:42,821 --> 00:15:43,507
Scott: Just a little fishy.

237
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:45,354
Rym: There's all sorts of them.

238
00:15:45,394 --> 00:15:54,090
Rym: Apparently, some young, I think it was a 25-year-old kid, was appointed to some high-up contractor-something position, and he was flying around Iraq in military jets.

239
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:05,430
Rym: So, at least this one had a happy ending, because the guy probably would have been able to stay in and do all of his evil crap, except that he had to lie about going to college.

240
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:05,851
Scott: No, wait.

241
00:16:05,911 --> 00:16:14,690
Scott: If this is a job that is appointed by the president, as opposed to some other hiring mechanism, isn't Bush just going to appoint some other idiot in the place?

242
00:16:15,356 --> 00:16:15,889
Rym: I don't know.

243
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,850
Scott: Does it need some sort of congressional or something approval?

244
00:16:19,051 --> 00:16:21,329
Rym: I don't think there's any congressional oversight for things like this.

245
00:16:21,972 --> 00:16:23,201
Scott: No approval by anyone?

246
00:16:23,302 --> 00:16:24,270
Scott: No committee anywhere?

247
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,589
Rym: Honestly, I really don't know.

248
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:26,132
Scott: Yeah.

249
00:16:26,273 --> 00:16:27,383
Scott: Maybe they should look into that.

250
00:16:27,423 --> 00:16:29,133
Scott: I mean, it seems like-- You know what?

251
00:16:29,173 --> 00:16:32,150
Rym: Maybe they should at least actually read the kid's resume.

252
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:36,328
Rym: I mean, when I get jobs, they call RIT and ask, "Hey, did this guy

253
00:16:36,368 --> 00:16:36,790
Rym: graduate?".

254
00:16:36,911 --> 00:16:38,346
Rym: And RIT says, "Yep, he

255
00:16:38,366 --> 00:16:38,548
Rym: did.".

256
00:16:39,472 --> 00:16:46,510
Scott: But it seems like a lot of appointments are just made by the executive branch, and no one else looks at it.

257
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,409
Scott: And that's something that should be fixed.

258
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,389
Rym: I mean, I guess the scary thing is that-- At least have some committee look at it.

259
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:56,750
Rym: If this guy hadn't lied about college, then there would have been no problem, because he hasn't done anything illegal.

260
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,850
Rym: He's just done things that were boneheaded and stupid.

261
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:01,658
Scott: Yeah.

262
00:17:01,738 --> 00:17:03,850
Scott: You should also be fired if you're boneheaded and stupid.

263
00:17:11,941 --> 00:17:13,044
Rym: So things of the day.

264
00:17:13,064 --> 00:17:19,179
Rym: I don't know how many of you out there have actually played Zelda's Adventure for the Philips CD-i.

265
00:17:20,184 --> 00:17:21,720
Scott: I never played it, but it is infamous.

266
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:27,035
Rym: But I played it at a Sears store a long time ago.

267
00:17:27,055 --> 00:17:28,480
Rym: They used to have demos of all these things.

268
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:36,420
Rym: And there's a video on Google Video that I discovered that kind of brings back that whole horrible experience.

269
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:41,220
Rym: It's a video of the actual gameplay from the Philips CD-i version of Zelda.

270
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,304
Scott: Wow.

271
00:17:42,324 --> 00:17:43,879
Scott: I never thought I'd see that.

272
00:17:44,921 --> 00:17:45,907
Rym: There's more to the game.

273
00:17:45,927 --> 00:17:47,880
Rym: There's a lot of FMVs and such.

274
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,040
Rym: But basically what you'll get out of this is that one, the game's terrible.

275
00:17:51,881 --> 00:17:56,059
Rym: Two, there are load times between every single screen.

276
00:17:56,922 --> 00:17:59,356
Scott: That was back in the day when they had 1X CD-ROMs.

277
00:17:59,377 --> 00:17:59,940
Scott: That's what happened.

278
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:06,640
Rym: Yeah, I remember dealing with that in, like, Under a Killing Moon with its four CDs or Phantasmagoria with its seven.

279
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:13,358
Scott: All I gotta say is this game looks exactly like a really bad version of Dink Smallwood or other shitty Windows 95 games.

280
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,003
Rym: Oh my god.

281
00:18:16,023 --> 00:18:22,120
Rym: I mean, to this day, I'll bet Nintendo just wants to kill itself over giving Philips the right to make a Zelda game.

282
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,017
Scott: I don't even know if Nintendo, what were they thinking?

283
00:18:25,097 --> 00:18:25,420
Scott: I don't know.

284
00:18:25,801 --> 00:18:26,905
Rym: They were forced to.

285
00:18:26,945 --> 00:18:31,240
Rym: They didn't want to give it away and they hated doing it, but they had to because of a license agreement with Philips.

286
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:35,220
Scott: Maybe we should go check in all the details on that one.

287
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:44,020
Rym: I used to know all the details, but basically it had to do with the fact that Nintendo and Philips were going to collaborate to make a CD extension for a Nintendo system.

288
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,850
Scott: But that was Sony and Nintendo.

289
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,200
Scott: That's how the PlayStation was born.

290
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,499
Rym: You know Sony Philips?

291
00:18:50,043 --> 00:18:51,199
Scott: No, Philips isn't Sony.

292
00:18:54,081 --> 00:18:59,079
Rym: They're all separate companies, but there's kind of an incestual relationship when it comes to the technology involved.

293
00:19:00,461 --> 00:19:09,220
Rym: And it ended up that Philips, in this case, had the right to use licensed characters from Nintendo games for a set period of time.

294
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:12,319
Rym: And Nintendo was obligated to honor that.

295
00:19:13,401 --> 00:19:16,260
Rym: Nintendo did not want them to make this game, but they had no choice.

296
00:19:17,341 --> 00:19:19,439
Scott: Nintendo should have at least stipulated the game didn't suck.

297
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:23,020
Rym: Yeah, that's not Nintendo's choice.

298
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,380
Scott: It doesn't matter because the game is now just some scary part of history that no one remembers or cares about.

299
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:34,420
Rym: Yeah, though it is eerie that the Nintendo Revolution controller on a superficial level looks a lot like the Philips CD-i controller.

300
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,900
Scott: Except for the fact that the Nintendo Revolution controller is useful and the CD-i controller is not.

301
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,700
Rym: Well, hence I said in a very superficial way.

302
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,137
Scott: Wait, didn't the CD-i controller have this giant yellow ball in it?

303
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:45,499
Rym: Mmm, it wasn't yellow.

304
00:19:46,065 --> 00:19:47,336
Scott: It had this giant ball in it.

305
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:50,800
Scott: I don't think it was like the Revolution controller now that I remember it.

306
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,460
Rym: In terms of that, it looked like a remote control.

307
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,651
Scott: I think it was only vertical.

308
00:19:54,711 --> 00:19:55,860
Scott: I don't know, was it even vertical?

309
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,743
Rym: Yes, it was vertical.

310
00:19:56,783 --> 00:20:01,480
Rym: There might have been different ones, but the one I played was vertical and terrible and hard to hold.

311
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:07,240
Scott: I'll have to go check it out because I remember there being this giant ball that you spun around or something.

312
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,512
Rym: I know Intellivision had that.

313
00:20:09,532 --> 00:20:10,479
Rym: It had the big black disc.

314
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,013
Scott: No, this is a big yellow ball.

315
00:20:13,275 --> 00:20:13,920
Scott: Like, round.

316
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,372
Scott: Maybe I'm just remembering something else.

317
00:20:16,392 --> 00:20:17,097
Scott: I have to go look it up.

318
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:23,660
Rym: So in that brief interlude, I showed Scott a picture of the Philips CD-i controller and he was indeed remembering something else.

319
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,860
Scott: I was remembering something else with a big yellow ball and I have to go look it up and find what the hell it is.

320
00:20:28,121 --> 00:20:29,540
Rym: I have no idea what you're talking about.

321
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,786
Scott: I don't know either now.

322
00:20:31,088 --> 00:20:32,255
Scott: I thought it was the Philips CD-i.

323
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:32,940
Scott: I guess it isn't.

324
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,026
Rym: Yeah, so anyway, your thing of the day.

325
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,657
Rym: You can talk about it just because we both found it.

326
00:20:39,201 --> 00:20:42,295
Rym: And I think everyone on the internet has found it because it's really cool, but...

327
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,340
Scott: Yeah, so this guy in Mexico City is a helicopter pilot, which is not a bad job.

328
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,530
Scott: Takes some skills.

329
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:50,340
Scott: Respectable.

330
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,750
Scott: And he goes around taking aerial photos, which is cool.

331
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:55,918
Scott: You know, aerial photos.

332
00:20:56,219 --> 00:20:56,420
Scott: Nice.

333
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,357
Scott: Especially when there's stuff that you can't see from the ground, like big giant stuff.

334
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:00,940
Scott: You know, whatever.

335
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:08,200
Scott: And he goes around taking pictures of things, but the thing in Mexico City, everything is apparently awesome.

336
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,800
Rym: Yeah, I mean, Mexico City, after looking at these pictures, looks like an interesting place to live.

337
00:21:13,101 --> 00:21:18,380
Scott: He took a picture of the biggest bullfighting arena in the world, and it wasn't full of people.

338
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,308
Scott: It had a bunch of people in it, but it wasn't full.

339
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,860
Scott: But apparently it's very impressive when it's full.

340
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,958
Scott: And I can imagine so now that I've looked at it.

341
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,838
Rym: There's a building that has a giant Wislowski from Monsters, Inc.

342
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:30,360
Rym: on the roof.

343
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:37,060
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what that is, but there were many, many apartment buildings that were like extra fancy.

344
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:40,511
Scott: And there were like extra fancy country clubs.

345
00:21:40,531 --> 00:21:50,200
Scott: And some of the greatest pictures were like, you know in a movie, there's like a Mexican drug lord who has like this tiny little island mansion that always looks like something that no one lives in.

346
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,219
Rym: They're all over the place.

347
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,946
Scott: He took a picture of like three of these things.

348
00:21:53,067 --> 00:21:55,496
Scott: One of them looked like a castle and had a boat at it.

349
00:21:55,636 --> 00:21:56,500
Scott: And I was like, holy crap.

350
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,077
Rym: My favorite one, and I gotta say, well there were two about this, but this is something the U.S.

351
00:22:02,158 --> 00:22:02,800
Rym: really needs.

352
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:09,600
Rym: And that Mexico, for all its problems, Mexico really looks like they're trying to take care of their less well-off people.

353
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,210
Scott: Well, at least in the Mexico City area.

354
00:22:11,271 --> 00:22:12,720
Scott: What do you get, you know, out in the desert.

355
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,900
Rym: Yeah, whatever, out in the desert.

356
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:14,760
Scott: Bandits, but...

357
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:22,040
Rym: But low-income housing, like massive, massive, massive tracts of identical, yet brightly colored houses.

358
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,331
Rym: These pictures look fake.

359
00:22:23,371 --> 00:22:23,999
Rym: They look like CG.

360
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,412
Scott: Yeah, as soon as I saw the picture, I was like, what, is this CG from?

361
00:22:27,432 --> 00:22:28,637
Scott: like The Sims or something?

362
00:22:28,878 --> 00:22:29,360
Scott: What is this?

363
00:22:29,621 --> 00:22:31,039
Rym: No, it's real, and it's awesome.

364
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:46,460
Scott: Yeah, it's like, this is a picture from the sky of just like miles upon miles of just grids of streets with identical houses perfectly evenly spaced from each other in like these flat, bright colors.

365
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,051
Rym: Brightly, brightly colored.

366
00:22:48,396 --> 00:22:48,700
Rym: Very neat.

367
00:22:49,061 --> 00:22:53,908
Scott: It's so, you know, uniform that it looks like a computer-generated image.

368
00:22:53,928 --> 00:22:54,650
Scott: It doesn't look real.

369
00:22:54,750 --> 00:23:01,000
Scott: Even the cars look fake in the setting, you know, but it's real, and it's pretty cool.

370
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:09,820
Rym: It seems like just Americans have this aversion to low-income housing, which to me is a crock because I think that really people deserve to have a place to live.

371
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,111
Scott: If you want one.

372
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:20,440
Rym: Well, the fact that the two of us, we're fairly highly-played professionals, and yet it's real hard to find affordable housing freaking anywhere in this country where there are jobs.

373
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,984
Scott: Yeah, it's like, it's easy to find a house.

374
00:23:24,004 --> 00:23:35,600
Scott: You can get a house in the middle of the boonies, but to get a house near a place where you can work, you either have to live in some terrible, terrible place, or you have to live for a lot of money.

375
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,945
Rym: Well, we live in the 'burbs?

376
00:23:36,965 --> 00:23:37,970
Rym: in New York City, basically.

377
00:23:37,991 --> 00:23:39,660
Rym: We live out on the commuter line, you know.

378
00:23:40,103 --> 00:23:41,029
Scott: We're beyond the 'burbs.

379
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:42,500
Scott: We're in, like, the outskirts.

380
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,060
Rym: Yeah, but at least we're still on the commuter rail line.

381
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,092
Scott: We are on the commuter line.

382
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:47,800
Scott: We're not, you know.

383
00:23:47,800 --> 00:24:06,680
Rym: But the thing is, even out here, there's a lot of people have big houses that are separated by a lot of land and sprawl, and it's set up to where there's absolutely no way you could actually have public transportation, and the roads are all long and windy and full of cars, and there's all this wasted space that really could have been used for actual affordable housing.

384
00:24:07,201 --> 00:24:10,827
Scott: Yeah, it's like, along the side of the highways, there's a bunch of trees, right?

385
00:24:11,088 --> 00:24:17,980
Scott: And I understand the trees are to keep sound and stuff from bothering everyone, but if you just put houses in the way, houses work as well as trees.

386
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,857
Rym: Well, no, see, that's odd, because people don't want to live next to a highway.

387
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:21,260
Rym: That's terrible.

388
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,253
Scott: Poor people don't care.

389
00:24:22,334 --> 00:24:22,780
Scott: They're poor.

390
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:34,420
Rym: No, I'm just talking about, like, there's a, I don't know if you've seen it, but between here and IBM, there's this big subdivision, and the subdivision is full of giant, freaking, million-dollar McMansions.

391
00:24:36,281 --> 00:24:42,216
Rym: And the thing is, people who buy them are even getting ripped off, because they're really condos, even though you get the whole house, and you don't own the land.

392
00:24:42,557 --> 00:24:43,620
Rym: Just a giant scam.

393
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,482
Rym: And that's not what this area needs.

394
00:24:46,522 --> 00:24:54,713
Rym: This area needs some affordable, nice, actually livable low-income housing, because honestly, people like us want low-income housing.

395
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:56,716
Rym: I don't really need a mansion.

396
00:24:56,916 --> 00:24:57,697
Rym: I'd like a mansion.

397
00:24:57,737 --> 00:24:59,940
Rym: I'd like a manor house and a butler, but I'm not going to get one.

398
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:09,358
Scott: Yeah, all I really need the house for is a place to sleep, shower, and put my stuff, and plug in to utilities and such.

399
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:10,320
Scott: You know?

400
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,239
Rym: Oh, and occasionally to have a sexy potty.

401
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:22,500
Scott: Well, occasionally a sexy potty, but, you know, if I had to, if my house was cheap enough, I could get, you know, the extra monies to have sexy parties and party houses, and ballrooms and things.

402
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:30,740
Rym: Yeah, the problem is, it seems like people who have larger houses, or who lived before, you know, sprawl came, really are overprotective of their property values.

403
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,720
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what's up with this property value nuttiness.

404
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:45,698
Rym: Honestly, unless you want to move from where you live someday, and your house is only an investment, I'm not saying that low property values are good, but you don't want your property value to rise steadily, because you know what rises along with that?

405
00:25:46,099 --> 00:25:46,940
Rym: Property taxes.

406
00:25:47,960 --> 00:26:00,040
Scott: Yeah, I don't know, I mean, if you're a renter, if you're a guy who owns a bunch of places and rents them out, you don't really care what the property value is, because you, you know, you care the property tax is low, because, you know, you can charge rent whatever you want.

407
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:11,641
Scott: You know, so I don't know why those people want property value to go up, unless they're, the only people who really care are the people who are in the business of buying and selling houses like crazy, or people who plan to move and- You know who else cares?

408
00:26:12,002 --> 00:26:21,180
Rym: People who live in subdivisions and are members of homeowners associations who don't understand how the property value actually affects them, and don't want their neighbor to have his grass too long.

409
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:22,956
Scott: Yeah, I don't get it.

410
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:29,255
Rym: Or, you know, the people who don't want wind power plants near them, or don't want cell towers, but still want cell service.

411
00:26:29,656 --> 00:26:31,380
Rym: We could do a whole episode on those people.

412
00:26:32,161 --> 00:26:32,497
Scott: Goddamn.

413
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:41,640
Scott: As far as I'm concerned, they should just imminent domain land wherever there is no cell signal, and put the most powerful tower they possibly can.

414
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:53,079
Rym: Hey, if I owned the land we live on right now, I'd totally call up Reisner Sprint and say, "Hey, you can put a cell tower on my roof if you'll pay for the electricity it uses, and maybe give me a free cell

415
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:53,319
Rym: phone.".

416
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,299
Scott: Yeah, that'd be great.

417
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:59,168
Rym: I actually read that on the outskirts of a lot of cities, cell phone companies will do that.

418
00:26:59,268 --> 00:27:07,040
Rym: If you own land, they'll pay you a nice rent forever, and they'll give you free cell service if you let them put a tower in your area.

419
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,583
Scott: I would totally go for that.

420
00:27:08,704 --> 00:27:13,720
Scott: I'd get the infinite data, infinite minutes, and then I'd get the fanciest phone, and I'd be all set.

421
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:14,502
Rym: Yeah?

422
00:27:14,642 --> 00:27:23,100
Rym: Well, like our friend Scott Johnson, his parents' house, they put a little gas... I don't know exactly what it is, but it's like a little gas compressor something station on their land.

423
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,848
Rym: And it's near the house, but it doesn't make any noise, and it's far away.

424
00:27:26,868 --> 00:27:31,380
Rym: And as a result, the gas company pays them quite a decent sum per month to keep it there.

425
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,102
Scott: Hmm.

426
00:27:32,773 --> 00:27:33,160
Scott: Not bad.

427
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:33,660
Scott: Yeah.

428
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:43,480
Scott: I should buy a house with a big piece of land off to the side of it, and then just sell that land to whoever, and just have this little area next to my house full of crap.

429
00:27:43,861 --> 00:27:45,307
Rym: Well, that land has to actually be useful.

430
00:27:45,327 --> 00:27:48,980
Rym: I mean, you have to actually be in a place where people want to pay you to put stuff on the land.

431
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,700
Scott: Yeah, leave it between my house and the neighbor's house.

432
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,784
Rym: It depends if they need a cell tower there.

433
00:27:53,864 --> 00:28:00,180
Rym: I mean, luckily, where we live now, I mean, there's a mountain outside my window, and I can see the cell tower I use because it's right there.

434
00:28:00,621 --> 00:28:02,330
Scott: Yeah, we get pretty good signal here.

435
00:28:02,592 --> 00:28:04,100
Scott: I don't get signal at my new office.

436
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:08,080
Rym: I didn't get signal when I lived in the other mountains up in Poquoi back in the day.

437
00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:08,568
Scott: Uh.

438
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:20,520
Rym: I didn't get such good signal when I lived in Vishco, but I think that was because I lived in an old French-style apartment, and it was, uh, I think the walls were just made of solid, horrible death or something, I don't know.

439
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,680
Scott: Yeah, I wonder if you get cell signal in Mexico.

440
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,667
Rym: I don't know, but you know what?

441
00:28:24,848 --> 00:28:26,160
Rym: I'd be able to find affordable housing.

442
00:28:28,381 --> 00:28:33,460
Rym: But I guess the main thing you'll get out of this is that Mexico City, I mean, Mexico's not a third world country.

443
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,720
Scott: We should go to Mexico City for vacation.

444
00:28:35,961 --> 00:28:36,274
Rym: You want to?

445
00:28:36,662 --> 00:28:36,835
Scott: Why not?

446
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:38,460
Rym: Alright, we can go to Mexico.

447
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,300
Scott: We'll just fly there.

448
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,120
Rym: I gotta get my passport all fixed up before we head down.

449
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:42,798
Scott: Mine's all good.

450
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,620
Rym: Yeah, my passport, I need it to be renewed and such.

451
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,939
Scott: You're gonna get the RFID, maybe.

452
00:28:48,902 --> 00:28:49,617
Rym: Uh, you gonna nuke it?

453
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:52,120
Scott: You have to get your tinfoil wallet.

454
00:28:52,741 --> 00:28:55,800
Rym: Or just put your, uh, passport in the microwave for 30 seconds.

455
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:01,700
Scott: You know, you could eat in one of those, like, E-ZPass bags that doesn't let E-ZPass go off if you put it in your glove box?

456
00:29:01,981 --> 00:29:03,179
Rym: Any Faraday cage will do it.

457
00:29:03,321 --> 00:29:03,604
Scott: Yeah.

458
00:29:04,595 --> 00:29:04,979
Scott: Go for it.

459
00:29:05,482 --> 00:29:09,300
Rym: But anyway, since it's anime day, we should probably talk a little bit about anime.

460
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,080
Scott: Well good, we just watched two animes.

461
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,600
Rym: Yeah, we watched- Crazy anime.

462
00:29:13,361 --> 00:29:14,099
Rym: Oh my god.

463
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,654
Rym: So we watched episode one of an old anime made in 1995 called Ninku.

464
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,420
Scott: N-I-N-K-U, as in Ninja, but without the Ja, and with the Ku instead.

465
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,160
Rym: Imagine a Naruto Cromartie, I guess.

466
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,020
Scott: That's the best we can come up with.

467
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,679
Rym: With a little bit of Jibaku with that penguin, and it's farting.

468
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:37,240
Scott: Okay, so, oh my god, this show is about this little kid.

469
00:29:37,941 --> 00:29:38,407
Scott: Okay, no.

470
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:39,399
Scott: Let's start before that.

471
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:46,820
Scott: It's about this world where there are Ninku, which are like this ancient secret order of awesome powerful ninjas.

472
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,559
Rym: Twelve awesome powerful ninjas.

473
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,580
Scott: Very s- well, there are twelve clans of powerful ninjas.

474
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:56,400
Rym: Yeah, there weren't so many of them though, and they held off- I thought it was just twelve guys, but they held off the Imperial Army.

475
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,198
Rym: I think it was twelve guys.

476
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:57,572
Rym: Alright.

477
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,939
Rym: It showed twelve guys.

478
00:29:59,302 --> 00:30:01,359
Scott: Okay, then maybe they had descendants, I think?

479
00:30:02,202 --> 00:30:02,920
Rym: I don't know, whatever.

480
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:09,040
Scott: Whatever, but they're basically the ninja-ness works almost identically to Naruto ninja-ness.

481
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,520
Rym: Only in such a stupid over-the-top way.

482
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:19,740
Scott: I mean, let me tell you, there was a scene where the guy did the same, you know, rapid set of hand gesture things they do in Naruto.

483
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,199
Scott: Like, straight out of Naruto.

484
00:30:22,021 --> 00:30:24,697
Scott: Of course, Naruto was straight out of this, because this came out in '95.

485
00:30:26,221 --> 00:30:35,260
Scott: And then, they spent, like, an entire minute with a frozen image, while some guy explained the entire ninja technique.

486
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,219
Scott: Like, in many, many words.

487
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,179
Rym: Yep, and a giant kanji was, like, flashing on the screen.

488
00:30:40,641 --> 00:30:45,197
Scott: I didn't even read any of those words, because I was too busy going, "Oh my god, he's explaining the technique!

489
00:30:45,257 --> 00:30:45,498
Scott: Oh my

490
00:30:45,538 --> 00:30:45,819
Scott: god!".

491
00:30:46,701 --> 00:30:54,240
Rym: Now, the opener to the show- I mean, at first they do this bit, they talk about these ancient whatevers, and they fought off the Imperial Army, and they're dangerous and cool.

492
00:30:55,342 --> 00:30:58,255
Rym: So the opener starts, and we think, "Alright, this is going to be a show about dangerous

493
00:30:58,295 --> 00:30:58,616
Rym: guys.".

494
00:30:59,922 --> 00:31:04,320
Rym: And then the opener proceeds to have probably the ugliest thing I've ever seen in anime.

495
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:08,420
Scott: The main character is just hideous and painful to look at, like you want to kill yourself.

496
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,211
Rym: Ah, did someone open the Ark of the Covenant?

497
00:31:10,614 --> 00:31:11,299
Rym: I can't look at you.

498
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:16,020
Scott: I mean, like, Naruto is painful to watch for a long time, because you get these 15 episode fights.

499
00:31:16,381 --> 00:31:23,720
Scott: But imagine if Naruto was ugly, and had giant eyeballs, and his tongue stuck out, and his cheeks were flappy, and ugh!

500
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,765
Rym: Like, we're not kidding.

501
00:31:26,046 --> 00:31:27,309
Rym: The kid's creepy looking.

502
00:31:27,991 --> 00:31:29,535
Rym: Like, ring-u creepy looking.

503
00:31:29,836 --> 00:31:31,100
Rym: Like, I don't want him looking at me.

504
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:33,295
Scott: But he has this pet penguin.

505
00:31:33,315 --> 00:31:33,680
Scott: that's funny.

506
00:31:34,021 --> 00:31:36,340
Scott: Yeah, it's actually a friend penguin, not a pet.

507
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,947
Rym: Yeah, they make a point of saying that.

508
00:31:37,967 --> 00:31:40,100
Rym: The show is every frickin' cliche ever.

509
00:31:40,521 --> 00:31:46,700
Rym: It's a boy who, his mother's kidnapped, and he, like, tries to stop the guy who's going to kidnap his mother.

510
00:31:47,201 --> 00:31:54,360
Rym: And then the guy pulls the whole, "Oh, if you want revenge, then become stronger and come after me, ahaha," and walks away.

511
00:31:55,141 --> 00:31:58,334
Rym: And then, you know, you meet someone, and, "Oh, let's be friends.

512
00:31:58,696 --> 00:31:59,378
Rym: Oh, I'll be your

513
00:31:59,419 --> 00:31:59,700
Rym: friend.".

514
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:02,372
Rym: And then they get kidnapped, and then, "Oh, he'll save,".

515
00:32:02,412 --> 00:32:04,260
Rym: and then he saves her, and oh my god.

516
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,899
Scott: Yeah, so you might be wondering how this tiny, tiny, he looks like a six year old, but I don't think he is.

517
00:32:09,422 --> 00:32:13,000
Scott: Little kid saves people from evil.

518
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,819
Rym: Well, he quite literally kicks their asses.

519
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:24,980
Scott: Yeah, basically, it turns out in the first episode, they reveal that the main character, the ugly little kid, is actually a crazy powerful ninku, former ninku, commander, whatever.

520
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:26,299
Scott: From some clan.

521
00:32:27,421 --> 00:32:29,149
Scott: And he has magic ninja powers.

522
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:31,320
Scott: He does the turning into a log trick.

523
00:32:31,861 --> 00:32:39,420
Rym: Yeah, it's funny, because you know the typical scene where there's a whole bunch of guys with guns, and then there's one guy on the other side, and the one guy charges and somehow beats them all?

524
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:47,460
Rym: That scene happens, except the kid charges them, and they open fire, and he gets riddled full of bullets and blood and falls over dead.

525
00:32:48,042 --> 00:32:48,738
Scott: But it's a log!

526
00:32:49,221 --> 00:32:50,840
Rym: Oh, it turns into a log, just like in Naruto.

527
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,204
Scott: It's the old ninja trick.

528
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:55,900
Scott: Well, Naruto, he turns into a log, just like in ninku, actually.

529
00:32:57,405 --> 00:33:00,920
Rym: The show is kind of funny, but kind of painful to watch.

530
00:33:01,861 --> 00:33:08,380
Scott: If the main character wasn't ugly, I would say the show is basically Naruto five years ago with a funny penguin.

531
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,108
Rym: Yep, and a little bit of Cromartie.

532
00:33:10,128 --> 00:33:12,100
Rym: There's a lot of Cromartie type dialogue.

533
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,326
Scott: Yeah, the dialogue is very Cromartie.

534
00:33:14,366 --> 00:33:17,940
Scott: Not much else is, but the dialogue is definitely Cromartie style.

535
00:33:18,721 --> 00:33:28,198
Rym: If anything, watch the opener, because if you see a full-grown woman riding a penguin as it flies, and the penguin is a normal-sized penguin.

536
00:33:28,218 --> 00:33:29,160
Rym: In fact, it's a little penguin.

537
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:29,938
Scott: It's a little penguin.

538
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:32,059
Rym: I don't know what to say about this show.

539
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,660
Scott: Yeah, I'm not gonna watch any more of it, that's for sure.

540
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:34,978
Scott: No, no.

541
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:41,717
Scott: But the penguin, two or three times during the episode, farts in order to fend off enemies.

542
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:43,000
Scott: And it works.

543
00:33:43,824 --> 00:33:43,950
Rym: Yeah.

544
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:44,742
Scott: Yeah.

545
00:33:45,429 --> 00:33:46,439
Scott: That's all you gotta say about that?

546
00:33:47,441 --> 00:33:49,168
Rym: I guess the show is trying to be funny.

547
00:33:49,188 --> 00:33:52,320
Rym: I can't imagine that the show is actually serious.

548
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,840
Scott: I think it might be funnier if you had, like, an anime club to watch it with.

549
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,840
Rym: Yeah, if we showed that to an anime club, they would've gone nuts.

550
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:04,140
Scott: You'd have to only- you couldn't watch more than one episode, though, 'cause it totally wouldn't keep going.

551
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,418
Rym: It's like a bobo-bobo-bobo-bobo.

552
00:34:06,366 --> 00:34:06,780
Rym: Yeah, exactly.

553
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,717
Rym: One episode is awesome, two episodes is shit.

554
00:34:09,522 --> 00:34:09,802
Scott: Yeah.

555
00:34:10,063 --> 00:34:15,699
Scott: Of course, after two minutes, he can't look at the kid anymore, but he's the main character.

556
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,304
Rym: Oh, god.

557
00:34:16,427 --> 00:34:17,020
Rym: Ark of the Covenant.

558
00:34:18,588 --> 00:34:19,239
Scott: Ark of the Covenant.

559
00:34:20,022 --> 00:34:20,188
Scott: Ninku.

560
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:29,400
Rym: So, the other show we watched was real short, and it's Masuda Kosuke Theater, Gag Manga Biyori.

561
00:34:30,183 --> 00:34:31,620
Scott: I think it's like, it's a gag.

562
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,699
Rym: Yeah, like gag manga.

563
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,772
Scott: Like a gag, a joke, you know, a practical joke, a gag.

564
00:34:36,194 --> 00:34:37,679
Scott: Gag Manga Biyori.

565
00:34:38,382 --> 00:34:43,659
Scott: Of course, they say "gag-you" because they can't, I don't know, it's a Japanese pronunciation of gag, I don't know.

566
00:34:45,382 --> 00:34:45,763
Rym: It's funny?

567
00:34:46,746 --> 00:34:51,380
Rym: It's short, and it's funny, you know, I'm not really sure what to think, 'cause it went by so fast.

568
00:34:51,840 --> 00:35:01,300
Scott: Yeah, it's, let's see, the first bit is this guy who's in charge of a company, and- He's talking really fast, constantly, as in he's not breathing, he's just talking.

569
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,460
Scott: Yeah, it's just talking, talking, talking, talking, talking, and then eventually that bit's over.

570
00:35:04,942 --> 00:35:20,960
Rym: And it's like, little joke, little joke, little joke, and each one of them's not that funny, but they keep hitting you with 'em, and you just, like, have this rolling chuckle through the whole thing, and then at the end it hits you with this one-two-three punch of three actually really funny jokes in a row, and by the end I was just hysterical.

571
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,380
Scott: Yeah, it was, I laughed a lot.

572
00:35:23,683 --> 00:35:24,840
Rym: The sticker, oh my god.

573
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:35,280
Scott: Yeah, so it starts off with this guy, he's yelling at his board of directors at the company, at a snack company, they make snacks, about the stickers that come in the snacks, because that's how they sell them to kids.

574
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:40,600
Rym: And oh my god, the stickers are just three very similar pictures of this depressed-looking, like, eight-year-old.

575
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:50,360
Scott: Right, so then he has them change 'em, and then he has them change his stickers again, and he keeps going, and they show a, when they turn the camera to the board of directors, it's like, what was it, Chain Wielder?

576
00:35:50,861 --> 00:35:52,260
Rym: Bear Killer something?

577
00:35:52,542 --> 00:35:55,920
Scott: Yeah, there were, like, four people, and it put their names and their occupation in it.

578
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:59,120
Rym: Yeah, we really can't explain the humor, you just have to watch this.

579
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:07,820
Scott: Yeah, it was, like, so-and-so the Bear Killer, and he was covered in, like, these scratch marks from Bear Claws, and another guy was, like, so-and-so the Chain Wielder, and he had chains wrapped around him.

580
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,803
Rym: That has nothing to do with what was going on.

581
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:29,900
Rym: Yeah, that may not sound funny, but oh my god, go to Anime Ski, and get this show, and watch one episode, it's not long.

582
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,619
Scott: There are actually four episodes, and I'm getting two, three, and four right now.

583
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,573
Rym: Yeah, it's just two, I really can't describe it.

584
00:36:36,337 --> 00:36:36,880
Rym: It's hilarious.

585
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:49,360
Scott: I don't think the quality of it is the highest quality, but the hilarity factor, at least in the first episode, you should at least watch the first episode, I haven't watched it anymore, because you will laugh.

586
00:36:50,901 --> 00:36:53,048
Scott: And quick, easy laugh, why not?

587
00:36:53,329 --> 00:36:56,780
Scott: Of course, it's the crazy, wacky kind of humor, I know some people might not like it.

588
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:03,540
Rym: Yeah, I mean, if you like Cromartie, or Excel, or anything weird like that, you freaking love this show.

589
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:07,290
Scott: Yeah, but if you're not into the weird stuff, but the weird stuff just makes you go, "Huh?

590
00:37:08,152 --> 00:37:09,075
Scott: What's going

591
00:37:09,095 --> 00:37:09,676
Scott: on?"

592
00:37:09,757 --> 00:37:10,960
Scott: Then you can probably forget about this one.

593
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:15,780
Rym: Yeah, this is not a show for people who aren't into anime, I guess.

594
00:37:15,841 --> 00:37:17,198
Scott: I don't think it really is so much anime.

595
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:21,875
Rym: Or at least have some kind of vague, dim understanding of Japan.

596
00:37:21,895 --> 00:37:22,818
Rym: At all.

597
00:37:24,404 --> 00:37:24,524
Scott: Maybe.

598
00:37:24,544 --> 00:37:24,785
Scott: I guess.

599
00:37:24,846 --> 00:37:26,594
Scott: The second one might relate to people.

600
00:37:26,634 --> 00:37:27,859
Scott: if you know what Pokemon is.

601
00:37:28,302 --> 00:37:28,720
Rym: Yeah, dokiwa.

602
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:36,160
Scott: If you know anything about Pokemon at all, like if you know it exists, and there are monsters in it, then the second half of the episode will amuse you.

603
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,524
Rym: But this definitely doesn't pass the street test.

604
00:37:38,885 --> 00:37:45,580
Rym: If you showed this to some randomish muck on the street, they wouldn't have any words to say to you, to express how they felt, I don't think.

605
00:37:46,221 --> 00:37:46,482
Scott: Yeah.

606
00:37:47,284 --> 00:37:49,292
Scott: They might just go, "What the hell?

607
00:37:49,593 --> 00:37:50,616
Scott: I was freaking fucked up,

608
00:37:50,657 --> 00:37:51,018
Scott: man.".

609
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:59,020
Scott: So, if you've been to our website, you can agree it's a little bit ugly, just a little bit.

610
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,360
Rym: Yeah, basically when we installed WordPress way back, it came with like four themes.

611
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:04,540
Scott: No, it didn't come with four themes.

612
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,400
Rym: No, you installed a bunch of themes.

613
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:09,180
Scott: It comes with two themes, the classic and the default, and I installed a bunch from this.

614
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,779
Rym: Yeah, we installed a bunch, and they were all crappy, and the one we picked was the least crappy of them, and we don't like it at all.

615
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,183
Scott: It has some problems with it.

616
00:38:16,243 --> 00:38:19,571
Scott: Like, I don't like how, you know, the way you figure out there are comments on.

617
00:38:19,611 --> 00:38:23,160
Scott: a post is based on the number next to the title, and it's just not great.

618
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,277
Rym: Yeah, also the fact that this theme doesn't do the WordPress stuff 100% correctly.

619
00:38:28,662 --> 00:38:29,779
Scott: Yeah, it's like...

620
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,380
Rym: Like, I had to do some terrible "fucking" with it to make it display the links on the right properly.

621
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:42,760
Scott: The other thing is I want to disable commenting on the blog part by people other than us.

622
00:38:43,201 --> 00:38:51,839
Rym: Yep, no offense to you guys, it's just that we want discussion to be in the forum, and we're going to use the comments mostly for things like, "Well, in this episode, Scott was

623
00:38:51,879 --> 00:38:52,079
Rym: sick.".

624
00:38:52,982 --> 00:38:56,359
Rym: Or, "Well, we got to clarify that it was actually this thing and not this

625
00:38:56,399 --> 00:38:56,540
Rym: thing.".

626
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:00,020
Scott: You know, just things we don't want to appear in the description of the podcast itself.

627
00:39:00,522 --> 00:39:01,400
Rym: So basically errata.

628
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:13,940
Scott: Yeah, but if I disable that feature that disables comment... If I enable the disabling of commenting, then the comment box still appears, and some people might be confused and try to use it.

629
00:39:14,481 --> 00:39:16,360
Scott: So I have to change the theme so that doesn't happen.

630
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,960
Scott: So basically I'm making a whole new theme, and it's going to look a lot like the default theme in the forums.

631
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:28,518
Scott: Because I actually looked at the style for the forums, and the guy's like, "Yeah, you can use this if you give me

632
00:39:28,558 --> 00:39:28,818
Scott: credit.".

633
00:39:29,702 --> 00:39:32,238
Scott: So I'm going to basically be hacking away at CSS stuff for...

634
00:39:32,841 --> 00:39:33,202
Rym: For now.

635
00:39:33,322 --> 00:39:40,580
Rym: And later on, we're still working, we've got some artist friends trying to help us make some good logos for GeekNights, better than our neon sign that was thrown together.

636
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:51,320
Scott: Yeah, if we can get like a square picture that looks really good, you know, for a GeekNights logo, then we could use that to label our MP3s with, and label our feed with it.

637
00:39:52,161 --> 00:39:58,420
Rym: And also eventually make our theme a very customized, cool-looking thing with some sort of theme to it, other than just color.

638
00:39:58,883 --> 00:39:59,165
Scott: Yeah.

639
00:39:59,992 --> 00:40:01,040
Scott: You know, cool stuff like that.

640
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:06,539
Rym: Yeah, that's all just in the works, so just be warned that the site may change a little bit as time goes on.

641
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:14,500
Rym: If any of you out there feel particularly artistically inclined, give us a ring, we can provide you with whatever reference photos you need.

642
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:20,300
Rym: And I guess the only reward we could offer you is that we'd credit you if we used anything you gave us.

643
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,300
Scott: Yeah, we'll credit anyone who gives us anything.

644
00:40:22,861 --> 00:40:27,999
Scott: Also, if you're musically inclined, make like, you know, if you made like little bumper musics for us, or...

645
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,700
Rym: A little guitar riff, a little jazz riff.

646
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,977
Scott: Anything like that that might be useful for us, you know, maybe.

647
00:40:34,017 --> 00:40:34,500
Scott: What do we need?

648
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,540
Scott: We need something to go, like, after the thing of the day, maybe, or...

649
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,165
Rym: No, we need something before our main bits.

650
00:40:40,607 --> 00:40:44,520
Rym: We'd like to have a different thing for every type of main bit, like anime day will be an anime thing, whatever.

651
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:49,580
Scott: Yeah, someone made like anime music for the anime day, like a different theme for each day of the week.

652
00:40:49,921 --> 00:40:55,100
Rym: But definitely following in the theme of GeekNights, you know, a late show, jazzy kind of late show music.

653
00:40:56,683 --> 00:40:56,764
Scott: Yeah.

654
00:40:56,784 --> 00:40:57,044
Scott: Alright.

655
00:40:57,406 --> 00:41:01,639
Scott: Also, um, join the forums, a lot of people have joined the forums like we tell them to.

656
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:05,380
Scott: Uh, do stuff in there, like, say something.

657
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,071
Rym: Well, honestly, the forums have been rocking mostly, just the last couple days.

658
00:41:09,111 --> 00:41:11,400
Rym: they've been a little slow, but normally there's a lot of people in there.

659
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,380
Rym: There have been some really good arguments, I'm real pleased with you people.

660
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,538
Scott: Yeah, so, um...

661
00:41:16,844 --> 00:41:17,238
Rym: Keep it up.

662
00:41:17,623 --> 00:41:19,679
Scott: Yeah, and all you other people.

663
00:41:21,301 --> 00:41:22,080
Scott: Join them.

664
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:23,520
Scott: Yeah, what are you doing?

665
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,020
Scott: I know you're not a member of any other forum on the internet.

666
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:34,560
Rym: I've noticed over time that the segment of listeners that's rising the most is iTunes people, who probably have never even seen the website.

667
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,099
Scott: Yeah, go to FrontRowCrew.com.

668
00:41:39,441 --> 00:41:41,520
Scott: You can throw a www at the beginning if you want.

669
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,140
Rym: Yeah, doesn't matter though, we only have one server.

670
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,299
Scott: Yeah, so FrontRowCrew.com.

671
00:41:53,723 --> 00:41:55,871
Rym: And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

672
00:41:56,111 --> 00:41:58,460
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

673
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:02,980
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.FrontRowCrew.com.

674
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,279
Scott: If you like our podcasts, you'll love our forums, make sure you visit them.

675
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:11,259
Scott: You can send your email feedback to GeekNights@gmail.com.

676
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,907
Scott: And if you want, you can leave us a voicemail at 206-333-1537.

677
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,360
Rym: GeekNights airs every weeknight, Monday through Thursday.

678
00:42:22,063 --> 00:42:25,300
Scott: GeekNights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

679
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,160
Scott: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
