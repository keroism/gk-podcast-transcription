1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,389
Scott: It's Tuesday, March 21st, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,980
Scott: Tonight we talk about the Mega Man X collection and Super Princess Peach.

3
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,237
Scott: Let's do this!

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:31,949
Scott: Alright, yesterday I reminded everyone that we had this cool frapper map, which is basically a Google map, and you put push pins in it if you're a listener of GeekNights, and then everyone can see where all the GeekNights listeners are.

5
00:00:32,371 --> 00:00:37,480
Scott: Once again, it's the thing that we forgot about, and yeah, we made it and we forgot about it until yesterday.

6
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,383
Scott: So if you go to the frontroadcrew.com on the right side of the page under Scott's Links, there's a link to it.

7
00:00:44,065 --> 00:00:48,980
Scott: But today, because I remembered it, I tried to customize it and add stuff to it.

8
00:00:49,221 --> 00:00:49,742
Rym: Oh really?

9
00:00:50,023 --> 00:00:54,837
Scott: And let me tell you something, frapper actually kind of sucks, like in a coding way.

10
00:00:54,857 --> 00:00:55,920
Rym: What'd they do wrong?

11
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,879
Scott: They're just SQL errors and PHP errors all over the place when you try to do certain things.

12
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:01,120
Scott: What?

13
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:06,140
Scott: It's just sloppy, sloppy as hell, like the shittiest coding of code.

14
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,840
Rym: No, no, I could, I'll wager I could make you some shittier code real quick.

15
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:20,393
Scott: Oh, there could be something worse that wouldn't work at all, but the point is it doesn't work well, and some parts of the interface are pretty terrible and uncustomizable, and it's like they made it customizable, but they don't let you do whatever you want.

16
00:01:20,815 --> 00:01:21,116
Scott: Uh-huh.

17
00:01:21,276 --> 00:01:22,440
Scott: It's not the greatest in the world.

18
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:23,212
Rym: Oh well.

19
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:32,084
Scott: But it's better than it was, and I added some cool stuff, and like I added my Flickr thing to the bottom right, and whatever.

20
00:01:32,345 --> 00:01:34,777
Scott: It should be a little more pleasant for you to use now, so...

21
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,178
Rym: Oh wait, you added the Flickr, so now people can see pictures of us.

22
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,580
Scott: Well, no, the things that I've taken pictures of in my Flickr, personal Flickr.

23
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,219
Scott: So if you had a Flickr, I could add your Flickr down there too.

24
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:46,507
Scott: Yeah.

25
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,380
Scott: Whatever.

26
00:01:48,561 --> 00:01:52,713
Scott: Anyway, also I want to remind everyone about the separate feeds business.

27
00:01:52,914 --> 00:02:02,425
Scott: If you're still confused about, you know, the fact that we have four days a week of podcasting, and you can subscribe to just one day, or all the days combined.

28
00:02:02,626 --> 00:02:06,240
Rym: Yeah, Yahoo podcast doesn't seem to quite understand this fact yet.

29
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:11,480
Scott: Well, Yahoo podcast, or it did at one point, and it doesn't, it goes, it's a minute-to-minute type of thing.

30
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:22,580
Scott: But now, you know, you can do it on iTunes by searching for GeekNights in the podcast directory, or you can just go to frontrowcrew.com, and I made a giant blog post that explains the whole thing in great detail.

31
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,080
Rym: So I swear to God, if you people keep asking for separate feeds after that...

32
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:28,047
Scott: Yeah, it was fine.

33
00:02:28,067 --> 00:02:34,140
Scott: if you asked before, you know, because I could understand I didn't put links on the website, I didn't make it a very publicly known thing.

34
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,540
Rym: Yeah, most of the people who subscribe to them seem to do so entirely on their own by finding them somewhere.

35
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,799
Scott: Yeah, but now it's, I've written it all up, and you can go do it.

36
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:45,395
Scott: So if you only want to listen to one day, go for it.

37
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,740
Rym: So in the news, Penny Arcade, of all people, have decided to delve into podcasting.

38
00:02:51,241 --> 00:02:52,995
Scott: Well, they're not really podcasting, they're just...

39
00:02:53,681 --> 00:02:54,999
Rym: Well, they called it podcasting.

40
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,820
Scott: Yeah, it's because they talk about interesting things three days a week anyway.

41
00:03:00,603 --> 00:03:05,420
Scott: You know, it's like, if we have a regularly scheduled interesting conversation, why not record it?

42
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,540
Rym: Now, there are actually a lot of answers as to why not.

43
00:03:10,963 --> 00:03:15,420
Rym: I love Penny Arcade, and they're awesome guys, but they didn't plan this so well.

44
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:26,360
Rym: No, I mean... I mean, first off, it sounds like what GeekNights sounded like, I don't know, a long time ago before any of you listening now knew it existed.

45
00:03:26,783 --> 00:03:26,955
Scott: Yeah.

46
00:03:27,282 --> 00:03:34,320
Rym: I mean, we had a microphone sitting in the middle of the room, and, you know, like a $2 microphone, the one that comes with your computer.

47
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,280
Scott: You know, the one that's just like a little plastic stick?

48
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,960
Scott: It's not even a microphone, really?

49
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,160
Rym: Yeah, like I got a creative one sitting here, that's the one we actually used before.

50
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:41,765
Scott: Wow.

51
00:03:42,381 --> 00:03:45,720
Rym: And it was just unlistenable, and it sounds like that's what Penny Arcade did.

52
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:52,720
Scott: Yeah, they just basically turned on this $2 microphone in the middle of the room while they discussed what to make the comic about, and then they turned it off.

53
00:03:53,041 --> 00:04:00,180
Rym: Two, I'll say that they don't know anything about audio, because I actually, you know, downloaded it and listened to it, and looked at the wave.

54
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,600
Rym: And seriously, if you guys are listening or anything, I'll help you make those waves not suck.

55
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:09,398
Scott: I don't think they actually did anything to the wave, I think-- No, they didn't!

56
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:16,459
Scott: All they did was cut and paste to get the content they wanted, and then they saved it as a wave and converted it to an MP3 and uploaded it.

57
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,600
Rym: Yeah, I ran about four filters on it before I could listen to it.

58
00:04:19,862 --> 00:04:27,937
Scott: Yeah, but Gabe did make a post just now that he says, "Oh, we realize we have to bring the audio quality up, we realize we actually need a podcast feed and maybe a BitTorrent or

59
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:28,339
Scott: something.".

60
00:04:28,741 --> 00:04:31,280
Rym: Yeah, what was the deal with the hosting they put it on?

61
00:04:31,862 --> 00:04:35,620
Scott: Okay, Penny Arcade is hosted by SpeakEasy, which is a hosting company.

62
00:04:36,621 --> 00:04:47,680
Scott: SpeakEasy owns this thing called FileCloud, which is one of those sort of file-planety places where you can get a file hosted, and then people can either pay to get it right away or wait in line if they don't want to pay.

63
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:48,980
Scott: You know, that sort of thing.

64
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,300
Rym: Those horrible kind of avoid-them-at-all-cost things.

65
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,380
Scott: Yeah, so when Penny Arcade has a file like an MP3 or whatever, they're not super techno guys.

66
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,240
Scott: Well, Tycho is kinda, but not really.

67
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,740
Scott: But he's only tech as far as gaming computers are concerned, as far as I know.

68
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,020
Rym: You know what would be hilarious?

69
00:05:05,584 --> 00:05:06,660
Rym: If they tried to use Libsyn.

70
00:05:06,984 --> 00:05:07,180
Scott: Yeah.

71
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,440
Rym: I don't think Libsyn could handle Penny Arcade's traffic.

72
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,740
Scott: Yeah, they said they got what, like 4,000-something downloads?

73
00:05:13,562 --> 00:05:14,579
Rym: Libsyn could deal with that.

74
00:05:15,068 --> 00:05:15,175
Rym: Yeah.

75
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:20,140
Rym: But, I mean, if they do this regularly, I mean, they said what, like 2,000,000 unique hits a day or something like that?

76
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:20,699
Scott: Oh, who knows?

77
00:05:20,961 --> 00:05:21,638
Scott: Penny Arcade's insane.

78
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:27,660
Scott: But I don't, you know, only a small percentage of those people are going to listen to the podcast, and only a smaller percentage will continue to keep listening.

79
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,120
Rym: Yeah.

80
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:34,199
Rym: Now, I'm not going to harp on their audio, because, I mean, GeekNights sounded just as bad way, way back when we started, you know, 80 episodes ago.

81
00:05:34,882 --> 00:05:38,700
Rym: You know, the secret episodes that I mentioned periodically but will never release to the light of day.

82
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,400
Rym: But, I mean, everyone has to learn, and can't rag on them for that.

83
00:05:44,142 --> 00:05:49,859
Rym: And the content was good, except for one basic glaring thing that was, frankly, painful to listen to.

84
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,460
Rym: It's Miyamoto.

85
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:55,440
Scott: Yeah, I think it was Taiko who said it was, what?

86
00:05:56,121 --> 00:05:56,578
Rym: Miyamoto.

87
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,140
Scott: Shigeru Miyamoto?

88
00:05:59,606 --> 00:06:00,239
Scott: Yeah, no.

89
00:06:00,982 --> 00:06:08,360
Scott: If you're supposed to be a professional who knows things, I mean, you make a comic about video games for a living.

90
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,560
Scott: You don't do anything else.

91
00:06:09,601 --> 00:06:12,135
Rym: In fact, You should be able to say, "Shigeru

92
00:06:12,216 --> 00:06:12,720
Rym: Miyamoto."

93
00:06:12,982 --> 00:06:15,419
Rym: In fact, they did a comic about it.

94
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,578
Rym: About him.

95
00:06:17,021 --> 00:06:18,580
Scott: And they spelled his name correctly.

96
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,480
Rym: They did that comic, it's in the frickin' book.

97
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:25,420
Scott: They've been to E3, and they've been, like, near Nintendo's booth.

98
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,540
Scott: And they must have been there where someone announced his name, or Nintendo people said his name.

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,899
Scott: Didn't they notice that those people didn't say it the way they're saying it?

100
00:06:34,986 --> 00:06:35,620
Scott: What the hell?

101
00:06:36,481 --> 00:06:38,779
Rym: But, I mean, other than that, it was actually pretty interesting to listen to.

102
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,189
Scott: Yeah.

103
00:06:40,021 --> 00:06:52,040
Rym: And honestly, for all you, uh, gig nights people out there, I don't think it would be a regular occurrence, but, would you guys like us to at least once record the, I don't know, 20 or 30 minutes of pre-production where we sit here and talk about what we're gonna talk about?

104
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:56,560
Scott: Yeah, 'cause that's what the Penny Arcade podcast basically is, is the pre-production of the comic.

105
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,160
Scott: It's Gabe and Taiko sittin' around, trying to figure out what to make the comic about.

106
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,160
Rym: Well, that's, I mean, that's what they have to do, unless they're gonna do Gabe and Taiko, the audio drama.

107
00:07:04,565 --> 00:07:04,820
Scott: Yeah.

108
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:13,120
Scott: So, you know, realize before we do the podcast every day, we spend, like, 20 minutes talking about the news, and what to talk about on the show, and all that sort of stuff.

109
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,537
Rym: Yeah, it usually goes along the lines of, "Hey, Rym, how 'bout this news, blah, blah,

110
00:07:16,557 --> 00:07:16,798
Rym: blah?".

111
00:07:17,382 --> 00:07:18,554
Rym: "Rym, I don't give a shit about

112
00:07:18,614 --> 00:07:18,816
Rym: that.".

113
00:07:19,463 --> 00:07:20,774
Scott: "Yeah, well, how 'bout this

114
00:07:20,835 --> 00:07:21,077
Scott: news?".

115
00:07:21,702 --> 00:07:23,299
Scott: "I don't know anything about that, let me read

116
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:23,360
Scott: it.".

117
00:07:25,503 --> 00:07:26,295
Rym: "Hey, Scott, what was your

118
00:07:26,336 --> 00:07:26,539
Rym: news?".

119
00:07:26,804 --> 00:07:27,008
Rym: "I don't

120
00:07:27,049 --> 00:07:27,376
Rym: remember.".

121
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,176
Scott: "Yeah, I don't remember, I gave up with it five minutes ago, what do you want from

122
00:07:30,196 --> 00:07:30,256
Scott: me?".

123
00:07:31,202 --> 00:07:33,538
Scott: "I forgot to delicious it, and I forgot to dig it, so it's

124
00:07:33,558 --> 00:07:33,779
Scott: gone.".

125
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:38,900
Rym: Yeah, but I mean, seriously, if you guys want us to do that once or twice, just tell us in the forums and we'll do it.

126
00:07:39,601 --> 00:07:40,780
Rym: There's really no skin off my back.

127
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,520
Scott: We'll do it once, it's not gonna be every day.

128
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,500
Rym: It's not the most exciting thing.

129
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,518
Scott: No, it's not.

130
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:57,640
Rym: Though, actually, for people who know us, at least can verify this fact, when we stop recording the show, we pretty much keep talking at about the same rate and about the same topics we were talking about on the show.

131
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:06,540
Scott: Well, usually after we record the podcast, we go to our separate rooms, so it's sort of, like, intermittent, like, someone has to have something important enough to walk down the hall to say.

132
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:12,931
Rym: If we had recorders that only recorded when both of us were in the same room at the same time, GeekNights could go 12 hours a day.

133
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,196
Rym: Perhaps.

134
00:08:15,216 --> 00:08:15,460
Scott: Perhaps.

135
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,115
Rym: Yeah, anyway, in actual news...

136
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:25,264
Scott: So, when Windows Vista was announced years ago, well, let's see, XP, when did XP come out, 2002?

137
00:08:25,264 --> 00:08:25,840
Rym: I don't remember.

138
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:30,057
Scott: I think in 2002, oh, 'cause it came out in 2002 because a year later was Server

139
00:08:30,057 --> 00:08:32,125
Scott: 2003. 2003

140
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,013
Scott: came out, I think, in 2004, actually.

141
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:34,299
Rym: Did it really?

142
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:39,100
Rym: Or right on the edge, 'cause we got 2003 Server New at IBM, where I worked not too long ago.

143
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:47,540
Scott: Regardless, it's been at least three years since the last Windows, and if you know, there's usually two years between Windowses, because, well, '98, 2000?

144
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,370
Rym: You know, Windows 95, Windows 97, which was renamed Windows 98 after it was delayed.

145
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:59,297
Scott: Yeah, so, Vista was originally supposed to come out in, like, 2005, something like that, maybe.

146
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:00,819
Scott: I don't remember.

147
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:05,400
Scott: It was delayed, and everyone was expecting it to come out in 2006.

148
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,960
Scott: That's sometime this year, with the expected date.

149
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:08,780
Rym: You know what?

150
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:15,040
Rym: If it's gonna come out this year, then so is, let's see, the PlayStation 3, Duke Nukem Forever.

151
00:09:15,902 --> 00:09:16,538
Rym: See a trend here?

152
00:09:18,081 --> 00:09:22,180
Scott: Uh, it was officially today delayed until 2007.

153
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:22,999
Rym: Ha ha!

154
00:09:25,162 --> 00:09:26,419
Scott: Yeah, uh, you know what?

155
00:09:26,963 --> 00:09:29,080
Scott: Since, uh, I don't want it to ever exist?

156
00:09:29,801 --> 00:09:31,199
Scott: And I don't want anyone to ever use it?

157
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,999
Rym: No, I want it to exist, I want it to come.

158
00:09:34,102 --> 00:09:34,210
Rym: Maybe.

159
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,559
Rym: I'm looking forward to it.

160
00:09:36,184 --> 00:09:36,375
Scott: Yeah.

161
00:09:37,082 --> 00:09:37,758
Rym: No, I really am.

162
00:09:39,092 --> 00:09:39,280
Scott: Alright.

163
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,279
Rym: No, not really, you wanna know why?

164
00:09:41,787 --> 00:09:42,058
Scott: Why?

165
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:58,519
Rym: Honestly, if Windows Vista is half as horrible, DRM-encrusted, and just bad, and power-hungry, even half as much as they've been claiming it's going to be, it's going to be nothing more than punishment meted upon those who decide to use it.

166
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,138
Scott: See, here's the funny thing about it, right?

167
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:07,140
Scott: Originally, they were like, "Oh no, we're gonna have to cut out these features to prevent delays," right?

168
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,759
Scott: Meanwhile, now they're delaying, and they still haven't added the features back in.

169
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,183
Rym: Huh.

170
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,555
Scott: It's like, remember they said, "Okay, we're gonna do this WinFS thing,".

171
00:10:15,576 --> 00:10:16,320
Scott: and it's like, "No, we're not.

172
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,780
Scott: We're gonna do this other thing.

173
00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:18,355
Scott: Uh, no, we're

174
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:18,520
Scott: not.".

175
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,800
Rym: See, WinFS was the one thing I was actually interested in seeing.

176
00:10:22,303 --> 00:10:27,359
Rym: All it is, WinFS is something you can do-- Yeah, wasn't it just metadata on top of NTFS or something like that?

177
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:42,700
Scott: No, it's, NTFS is your file system, but in your operating system somewhere, there's a database, like an SQL database, that stores all sorts of information about your files and things, so that it's sort of like a, like a little Google, it's like Google desktop, basically, but lower level.

178
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:49,000
Scott: Like, part of the, if Google desktop was part of the operating system, the same way Internet Explorer is part of the operating system.

179
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,000
Rym: But no, we're not getting anything.

180
00:10:51,282 --> 00:10:53,860
Scott: No, you're not getting any of the features, and you have to wait longer.

181
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:55,699
Rym: And we're still getting all the DRM.

182
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,039
Rym: They're making sure that's all there.

183
00:10:57,503 --> 00:10:57,594
Scott: Yep.

184
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:04,060
Scott: Alright, so, uh, last week, I think I talked about, uh, the Apple France deal.

185
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,940
Rym: Well, you think, you know, we just looked it up before we did the show here.

186
00:11:07,342 --> 00:11:07,999
Scott: Yeah, we did.

187
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:19,320
Scott: Um, basically, the story was, in case you missed it, uh, in France, they were gonna make a law that says you can't, you know, sell MP3s that are locked in.

188
00:11:19,963 --> 00:11:22,240
Scott: Well, it's a broader reaching law than that.

189
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:27,700
Rym: Basically, it says that iTunes has to sell unencumbered MP3s in addition to everything else.

190
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:36,700
Scott: Or it has to keep, they can keep selling their little, you know, DRM'd files, but they have to allow all the other players to play them.

191
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:44,620
Rym: Yep, basically, in some way, they have to open it up so that any device can listen to iTunes music, so that you're not locked into an iPod.

192
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:45,542
Scott: Exactly.

193
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:53,560
Scott: So, you realize that Apple makes all its money because they, the iTunes Music Store is pretty much the best music store for people who like to pay for their music.

194
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,480
Scott: And who like, you know, hit music from record companies and such.

195
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,800
Rym: Well, I'd sense a little, uh, dislike.

196
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:08,700
Scott: Yeah, but if you use iTunes, the only really way you can bring that music around the world with you is with an iPod because it's locked in.

197
00:12:09,181 --> 00:12:10,639
Scott: And France is gonna say you can't do that.

198
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,440
Rym: Yeah, claiming all sorts of anti-monopoly, anti-trust.

199
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:18,334
Scott: So everyone was hoping that France would really do it, and the assembly voted 296 to 193 to approve the bill.

200
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:30,380
Scott: Well, now everyone thinks Apple, rather than caving in and, you know, complying with the law, is just not gonna do business in France.

201
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,660
Scott: No iTunes Music Store for the French people.

202
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,028
Rym: Yeah, and you know what?

203
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:34,880
Rym: That's great.

204
00:12:35,342 --> 00:12:36,100
Scott: That's really terrific.

205
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,095
Rym: I mean, that's international law and commerce and everything all coming together.

206
00:12:40,155 --> 00:12:41,240
Rym: You voted for it, you got it.

207
00:12:41,664 --> 00:12:41,867
Scott: Yep.

208
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:42,860
Scott: Awesome.

209
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:44,419
Scott: Very awesome.

210
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,460
Rym: So we'll see what actually happens with this.

211
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:52,340
Rym: We'll, uh, we'll keep you all posted, though you can obviously read Fark or Slashdot or Dig or anything to find out what's going on there.

212
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,780
Scott: Yeah, see, basically what it comes down to is that the French market isn't really worth that much money.

213
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:06,900
Scott: And if it was a bigger market, like the US that did this, then, uh, Apple might cave in or do something about it.

214
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,040
Scott: But because it's just little old France, they don't care.

215
00:13:10,641 --> 00:13:18,420
Rym: Plus, I mean, French citizens could probably still use iTunes just by accessing it through various proxies or overseas or anything.

216
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,780
Rym: They just couldn't officially do business in France anymore.

217
00:13:22,461 --> 00:13:26,696
Rym: If they decided to not comply, which, there's no way on Earth they would actually comply.

218
00:13:26,716 --> 00:13:27,740
Rym: That would kill them.

219
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:42,660
Scott: Yeah, if they complied with this, then people would be, like, getting French credit cards and buying music from the French store, and getting all these hacked players, or France would become, like, the territory of, like, a million MP3 distribution sites.

220
00:13:43,443 --> 00:13:44,619
Rym: Even though Sweden's where it's at.

221
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,818
Scott: Yeah, Sweden is where it's at.

222
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:55,650
Rym: Alright, it's time for Things of the Day.

223
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:01,990
Rym: Now, my thing, and I discovered this, well, I discovered it a little while ago, and I just kind of forgot about it.

224
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:08,010
Rym: For some reason, I ended up at the site again, and I was looking through it, and I realized just how full-featured and well-done it is.

225
00:14:08,572 --> 00:14:12,410
Rym: Now, someone out there has created a Mario World World Editor.

226
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:19,109
Rym: Meaning, you can take Super Mario World, as in the SNES Mario game, and make your own levels for it.

227
00:14:19,754 --> 00:14:19,989
Scott: Awesome.

228
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:26,230
Rym: Like, right down to changing sprites, changing everything, changing the overworld, making an entirely new game.

229
00:14:26,811 --> 00:14:28,290
Scott: Can you play those levels?

230
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,690
Rym: Yes, you can make patches that you then apply to the ROM, and then play the ROM.

231
00:14:32,296 --> 00:14:32,630
Scott: Awesome.

232
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:42,590
Rym: Now, you're really not going to be able to play this on an SNES unless you have one of those old, like-sang, hard-to-find SNES flash carts from back in the day.

233
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:43,414
Scott: Wow.

234
00:14:43,434 --> 00:14:45,070
Scott: I didn't even know those things existed.

235
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,600
Rym: There's all sorts of things like that.

236
00:14:46,681 --> 00:14:47,970
Rym: Mostly, there were ROM dumpers.

237
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,810
Scott: Yeah, I didn't know that there were flash carts for all these things.

238
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,323
Scott: I knew there were ROM dumpers, but in those days, there was no internet.

239
00:14:53,343 --> 00:14:54,590
Scott: It was hard to get those sorts of things.

240
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,117
Rym: Yeah, but the thing is, a lot of people had ROM dumpers.

241
00:14:57,538 --> 00:15:00,930
Rym: At least, enough people had ROM dumpers to dump all those ROMs.

242
00:15:01,331 --> 00:15:02,095
Scott: Yep, true.

243
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:05,070
Scott: Of course, I think it was really, like, five guys dumping all of them.

244
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:05,748
Rym: I could see that.

245
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,290
Scott: It was the internet that propagated them.

246
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:09,557
Rym: I considered buying one a long time ago.

247
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:13,550
Rym: Before, there weren't so many ROMs easy to find, and I had some games I wanted to make ROMs of.

248
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:14,134
Rym: Mmm.

249
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:17,730
Rym: And then, you know, the internet exploded, and that was the end of that.

250
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:18,179
Scott: Yep.

251
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,834
Rym: But, I mean, check this thing out.

252
00:15:19,974 --> 00:15:22,441
Rym: It's really, really full-featured.

253
00:15:22,762 --> 00:15:25,270
Rym: Just look at the screenshots and see some of the examples he's made.

254
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,635
Rym: He's made entire overworlds.

255
00:15:26,876 --> 00:15:30,069
Rym: He made an entire demo game to show how powerful it is.

256
00:15:30,654 --> 00:15:32,509
Scott: We should download that game and play it.

257
00:15:32,771 --> 00:15:35,350
Rym: We should make, uh, Geek Knight Brothers.

258
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:36,431
Rym: Heh.

259
00:15:36,896 --> 00:15:38,109
Scott: With the sprites of you and me.

260
00:15:38,433 --> 00:15:38,646
Scott: Yeah.

261
00:15:39,091 --> 00:15:40,389
Scott: Yeah, that won't be that fun.

262
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,148
Rym: No, it wouldn't.

263
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:45,880
Scott: Alright, anyway, I got two things of the day here, 'cause one, I thought I did, but I didn't.

264
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:48,767
Scott: And combined, I think they're kinda silly.

265
00:15:49,168 --> 00:15:50,210
Scott: And they're really similar, also.

266
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:50,872
Rym: Yeah.

267
00:15:51,315 --> 00:15:53,590
Rym: They're well done, they're just not that engaging.

268
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,554
Scott: Yeah, they're not, uh, so funny.

269
00:15:55,714 --> 00:15:57,257
Scott: Like, you might get a little chuckle out of 'em.

270
00:15:57,658 --> 00:16:04,370
Scott: But they're the really, uh, high, well, it's not high production value as in money, but they put a lot of effort into it.

271
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:12,987
Scott: The first one is a video, uh, on CollegeHumor of some kids walking through the park, and then Final Fantasy happens.

272
00:16:13,408 --> 00:16:14,330
Scott: That's pretty much it.

273
00:16:14,811 --> 00:16:16,310
Rym: It's really well done.

274
00:16:16,931 --> 00:16:24,442
Scott: Like, they tried really hard, and they used special effects, and everything is really slick, and it doesn't look like two kids in a camera kind of movie.

275
00:16:24,462 --> 00:16:29,550
Scott: It looks like they tried, like for a school project, but a high quality, important school project.

276
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:36,321
Scott: The other one is this guy dressed up as Link, going around, doing Link things around town.

277
00:16:36,782 --> 00:16:41,010
Scott: But when he does the Link things, they make the Link sound effects, and it's kind of funny.

278
00:16:41,431 --> 00:16:49,189
Scott: Like, when he uses the shovel, and it sounds like shoveling, and, you know, he spins around with the sword, and it sounds like spinning sword, and...

279
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,010
Rym: Yeah, our things are a little weak today.

280
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,829
Scott: Yeah, the internet is, uh, in a little rut right now.

281
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:59,570
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I saw things I could've used, but they're things you'll see on BB Spot or Fark anyway.

282
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,649
Scott: Yeah, I mean, and I'm not gonna send you to a YTMND.

283
00:17:03,811 --> 00:17:06,388
Rym: [laughs] Why don't we make our own YTMND?

284
00:17:07,212 --> 00:17:09,189
Scott: Oh my god, no thing of the day today, what the fuck?

285
00:17:10,232 --> 00:17:12,728
Scott: [laughs] You're the man now, dawg.

286
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:20,869
Rym: So, it being Tuesday and video game day, we're gonna go back to the standard format here and review two games.

287
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:24,902
Scott: The two games we bought most recently on a trip to GameStop.

288
00:17:25,021 --> 00:17:27,250
Scott: Or was it, it was actually two separate trips to GameStop.

289
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,570
Rym: Yeah, I actually didn't buy Princess Peach until recently.

290
00:17:30,331 --> 00:17:32,229
Scott: Well, it wasn't out the first time we went, I don't think.

291
00:17:32,932 --> 00:17:40,710
Rym: So anyway, as you might've gathered, we're gonna talk about the Mega Man X collection, which Scott has been playing, and Princess Peach, which I have been playing.

292
00:17:41,672 --> 00:17:42,570
Rym: Uh, you wanna start here?

293
00:17:42,893 --> 00:17:43,309
Scott: Oh yeah, sure.

294
00:17:43,678 --> 00:17:43,830
Scott: Alright.

295
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:49,630
Scott: So, if you don't know, Mega Man is not Mega Man X, whatever Tycho would have you believe.

296
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:50,850
Rym: So it's not Mega Man X?

297
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:51,791
Scott: No, it's not.

298
00:17:51,871 --> 00:18:09,330
Scott: Mega Man X is not Mega Man X. You see, before, in between Mega Man 5, around the time Mega Man 5 came out, and before Mega Man 6 came out, they released a game for the Super Nintendo called Mega Man X. The character in the game looked a lot like Mega Man, but he was not Mega Man.

299
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:15,970
Scott: He was a distant future robot that was somehow related to Mega Man, but not Mega Man himself.

300
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:22,668
Rym: See, as far as I'm concerned, it's a blue guy who shoots pellets out of a gun arm and fights robot masters.

301
00:18:22,808 --> 00:18:23,310
Rym: It's Mega Man.

302
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:28,650
Scott: Oh, see the thing is, in Mega Man, the robot masters are always something man.

303
00:18:29,312 --> 00:18:30,610
Rym: Now they're something animal.

304
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:32,721
Scott: Now they're something animal.

305
00:18:33,223 --> 00:18:34,510
Scott: Usually adjective animal.

306
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,530
Rym: The flaming stag is currently my favorite.

307
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,230
Scott: Yeah, flaming stag's a good one.

308
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:46,930
Scott: So, the Mega Man collection, they released it a while ago, has like Mega Mans 1 through 8 on a single disc.

309
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:54,630
Scott: And it was kind of annoying in that one, because you couldn't configure the controls, so like A was backwards, basically.

310
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,630
Scott: A and B were not the right buttons, so it was hard to play.

311
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:07,470
Scott: But the Mega Man X collection fixes that problem, and it gathers Mega Man X1 through Mega Man X6 for 30 bucks on a single disc.

312
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:12,470
Scott: And you can configure the buttons however you want, because you could configure the buttons in the original games anyway.

313
00:19:13,911 --> 00:19:19,470
Scott: And one advantage of this versus the original is that you don't have to remember passwords to save your game.

314
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:25,050
Scott: It just, when it gets to the password screen, you say save, and it'll save the passwords essentially.

315
00:19:25,871 --> 00:19:30,010
Rym: But the password's still there, so if you have the original game, you could just pop that password in.

316
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:30,712
Scott: Of course.

317
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:34,009
Scott: I mean, if they made a Metroid game, if they tried to remake the original Metroid...

318
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,470
Rym: And I couldn't type Justin Bailey?

319
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:36,417
Scott: Exactly.

320
00:19:36,438 --> 00:19:37,209
Scott: That's what it's about.

321
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,750
Rym: Or Kid Icarus, Icarus fights Medusa Angel?

322
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:40,411
Scott: Yep.

323
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:44,950
Scott: So, the password's still there, but you just save them to save yourself a lot of effort.

324
00:19:45,731 --> 00:19:50,150
Scott: And you can have like three save slots per Mega Man X game, which is really cool.

325
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:50,454
Scott: Ah.

326
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:54,490
Scott: So there's a total of 18 save slots, which is wicked awesome.

327
00:19:55,231 --> 00:20:03,010
Rym: Now, I'd like to preface Scott's discussion of this game by noting that I have sat in the room with him through much of the time he's spent playing these games.

328
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:09,750
Rym: And he has done nothing but yell at the screen and bitch and complain about them the entire time, but yet he swears he loves them.

329
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,870
Scott: Well, because the thing is, it's hard.

330
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:18,570
Scott: It's like back in the day when you're a little kid and you couldn't beat games because maybe you didn't have the skill, or maybe because they actually were really hard.

331
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,070
Scott: Mega Man X is really hard.

332
00:20:21,652 --> 00:20:26,070
Scott: The other thing is that when I'm playing these games, I'm trying to get everything.

333
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,673
Scott: I mean, you don't have to get everything.

334
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:33,550
Scott: If I just wanted to beat the game and do the minimum effort required to beat the game, I would just fly right through these things.

335
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:39,890
Scott: But I'm trying to get every little heart power up and every weapon and every little secret thing and I don't want to miss stuff.

336
00:20:40,171 --> 00:20:44,430
Rym: Now, I'll also note that the way you're finding everything is, uh, game facts.

337
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:52,666
Scott: Well, you see, the reason for that is if you play a Mega Man game, sometimes you can figure out the order to fight the bosses in.

338
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:55,593
Scott: You can figure it out.

339
00:20:55,613 --> 00:20:59,790
Scott: You're like, "Oh, I beat the flame guy," and then obviously the flame guy beats the ice guy.

340
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:00,789
Rym: Or the wood guy.

341
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:01,820
Scott: Or the wood guy.

342
00:21:01,962 --> 00:21:02,590
Scott: It's obvious.

343
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:05,610
Scott: But sometimes, in these games, it's not so obvious.

344
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:16,110
Scott: And my choices are really to either play these games so much that I figure out the order to beat the guys in and where all these stupid secrets are after, like, years and years of searching.

345
00:21:17,231 --> 00:21:26,330
Scott: Or just look on game- and the only thing I look on game facts for is what order do I beat the boss in and where are the major secrets located so I don't have to go hunting for them.

346
00:21:27,112 --> 00:21:33,270
Scott: That's the only thing I really look for because it's really not worth my time to figure that out, especially since I'm playing six games.

347
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:38,370
Scott: If it was one Mega Man X game, then I would probably, you know, find it on my own.

348
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,537
Scott: But six games?

349
00:21:39,859 --> 00:21:40,483
Scott: Forget about it.

350
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:41,368
Scott: I'm gonna look it all up.

351
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:53,490
Scott: And the fun is still in me using my platforming Mega Man skills to beat the bosses and fight the bad guys and avoid the spiky traps and all that good stuff that Mega Man's all about.

352
00:21:54,892 --> 00:21:58,150
Scott: Anyway, the first three games are Mega Man X 1, 2, and 3.

353
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,025
Scott: And I gotta say, it's 30 bucks.

354
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:08,830
Scott: And it's just worth 30 bucks right away because Mega Man X 3 is a super rare game that's worth at least 20 bucks.

355
00:22:09,491 --> 00:22:13,550
Scott: So you're getting that and five other games, you can't really turn this down based on that alone.

356
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:14,671
Scott: Alright?

357
00:22:15,195 --> 00:22:17,129
Scott: Now the first three games are SNES games.

358
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:21,650
Scott: And the second three games are PlayStation games, which are kinda different and crazier.

359
00:22:22,314 --> 00:22:24,809
Scott: And there's a lot more stuff going on.

360
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:33,060
Scott: But basically, you know, Mega Man X is like, the same thing as Mega Man, but like, advanced.

361
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,952
Scott: It's like the difference between Street Fighter 2 and Street Fighter Alpha.

362
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,098
Scott: Where all the guys are bigger and crazier, and it was like, you know.

363
00:22:46,101 --> 00:22:49,000
Rym: So I gotta admit, I never really liked any of the Mega Man games.

364
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:53,467
Rym: The only ones I ever owned were Mega Man 2 and Mega Man 3.

365
00:22:53,467 --> 00:22:54,418
Scott: Yeah, those were the best ones.

366
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,900
Scott: But Mega Man X was also, Mega Man X is probably, the first Mega Man X is probably the third best one.

367
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:09,020
Rym: See, watching you sit there, and for at least 15 minutes, jump back and forth trying to get up one ledge to get to one secret, failing over and over and over again.

368
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,520
Scott: Those are unnecessary secrets, that's only because I'm going for the extra hard stuff.

369
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,580
Rym: Yeah, but just watching that was frustrating enough, let alone playing the game.

370
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,440
Rym: It's because it's hard.

371
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,379
Scott: See, there's a difference between tedious and hard.

372
00:23:19,701 --> 00:23:21,620
Scott: Tedious is like World of Warcraft.

373
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:26,079
Scott: You don't actually, it's not hard, you just have to click the thing a thousand times and then you get it.

374
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,600
Scott: This, you could get it in one try if you had mad skills.

375
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,339
Scott: There's nothing tedious about it.

376
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,480
Scott: It's just, it's hard, so you don't get it in one try.

377
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,939
Scott: You have to keep trying until you get it.

378
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:39,720
Rym: I guess for me it's just, it's well beyond my risk/reward curve.

379
00:23:40,724 --> 00:23:43,960
Scott: The risk and the time spent- Then you would just skip over those secrets and just beat the game.

380
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,719
Rym: Nah, I don't think I even get that far.

381
00:23:47,061 --> 00:23:55,759
Scott: But if you just try to beat the game and you're not trying to get annoying secrets or do dangerous stunts and things, you could just walk right through the game, you wouldn't have to redo a single step.

382
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:59,240
Scott: Unless of course, you died frequently because you sucked.

383
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:08,900
Scott: I mean, the fact that you see me doing those things over and over again is because my skill is somewhere in between complete schmuck and god of gods.

384
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:14,460
Scott: The fact, because if I was a complete schmuck, every time I tried to get a secret, I would die.

385
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,800
Scott: I would be like dead, I'd fall on spikes or something.

386
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,539
Scott: And I'd have to do the whole level again.

387
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:25,560
Scott: The fact that I can stay in one spot without dying trying to get the secret over and over again is because I'm good enough.

388
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,260
Scott: You know, if you're the god, you just get the secret on the first try and keep going.

389
00:24:31,182 --> 00:24:32,020
Scott: But that's how the game is.

390
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:44,000
Scott: If you don't have a lot of platforming skills, you probably won't like Mega Man X. But if you want to get a lot of pla- If you want to get platforming skills, play Mega Man X because you'll get lots and lots of platforming skills.

391
00:24:44,222 --> 00:24:46,239
Rym: I'd say just play the original Mega Man games instead.

392
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:50,500
Scott: You can play those too, but Mega Man X has a lot of cool, extra, more fun stuff.

393
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,659
Scott: Especially if you're someone who likes newer games.

394
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,939
Scott: Like you can slide on walls and kick off of them.

395
00:24:57,461 --> 00:24:58,995
Scott: And you can charge up the gun better.

396
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,160
Scott: And there's all kinds of special moves.

397
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:07,080
Scott: It's generally a more advanced game overall.

398
00:25:07,501 --> 00:25:07,750
Rym: Uh huh.

399
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,120
Scott: A lot less rough around the edges.

400
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,140
Scott: A lot more abilities of Mega Man.

401
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:13,758
Scott: A lot more complex levels.

402
00:25:14,782 --> 00:25:15,299
Scott: And it's harder.

403
00:25:16,225 --> 00:25:16,460
Scott: Typically.

404
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,239
Rym: So for a number of reasons, I picked up Super Princess Peach here for the Nintendo DS.

405
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,474
Scott: I was gonna get it.

406
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,055
Scott: Yeah.

407
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:24,958
Scott: But then you got it.

408
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:25,778
Rym: Yeah, I got it.

409
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,078
Scott: So I guess I can't get it.

410
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,440
Rym: Now, if I had one thing to say about this game.

411
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:34,899
Rym: If I had to encapsulate it in one word and one word alone, that word would be "pink".

412
00:25:36,404 --> 00:25:37,378
Scott: I thought the word would be "cute".

413
00:25:38,064 --> 00:25:40,160
Rym: I don't know, I think pink is starting to edge out cute.

414
00:25:40,744 --> 00:25:43,040
Scott: Oh wow, cause I'm more in it for the cute than the pink.

415
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,519
Rym: Don't worry, there's a lot of cute.

416
00:25:45,562 --> 00:25:45,924
Rym: The game.

417
00:25:45,964 --> 00:25:48,820
Rym: so far, I've only gotten a little bit into the game.

418
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,540
Rym: I'm in the boo house.

419
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:51,558
Rym: You can't.

420
00:25:51,961 --> 00:25:52,920
Scott: That's the best part of the game.

421
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:53,539
Scott: It's a boo house.

422
00:25:53,921 --> 00:25:56,019
Rym: It's like the third board of the game.

423
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,377
Rym: It's set up kind of like Mario World, except you don't really get to pick where you're going.

424
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,279
Rym: Everything's very linear.

425
00:26:02,564 --> 00:26:04,179
Rym: And it started out very easy.

426
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,099
Rym: Painfully easy.

427
00:26:06,462 --> 00:26:09,659
Rym: Easier than I would ever expect even a Nintendo game made for kids to be.

428
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,960
Rym: But the difficulty has been increasing at a steady rate.

429
00:26:13,821 --> 00:26:15,459
Rym: And I have high hopes for the end of the game.

430
00:26:16,842 --> 00:26:17,680
Scott: That's kind of surprising.

431
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,859
Scott: I figured it would stay relatively easy, I mean.

432
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:21,360
Rym: Well let me put it this way.

433
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,060
Rym: It got to a part that looked like a, "Alright, there's no way to die here.

434
00:26:25,461 --> 00:26:26,514
Rym: No matter what, you'll make it

435
00:26:26,534 --> 00:26:26,777
Rym: through.".

436
00:26:27,143 --> 00:26:27,659
Rym: And you know what?

437
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:28,520
Rym: I died.

438
00:26:30,905 --> 00:26:32,880
Rym: I don't die often, but I have died in this game.

439
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,099
Scott: Maybe that's just cause you're no good.

440
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:46,819
Rym: No, it was an area that looked like, alright, it's an area where you discover that there's lines, and if you have your umbrella, you can jump and then ride in the umbrella upside down hanging from the lines.

441
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:54,300
Rym: And you can jump up while you're riding, and you have to catch the lines as they're going and avoid enemies and pick up coins, whatever.

442
00:26:55,121 --> 00:26:57,358
Rym: And it looked like one of those, "Alright, you can't lose

443
00:26:57,398 --> 00:26:57,620
Rym: deals."

444
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:06,680
Rym: Like in the old Guerrilla War game where you go down the mine car track, or the Indiana Jones game where you go down the mine car track.

445
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,218
Rym: That kind of thing.

446
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,559
Scott: Yeah, the mine car tracks.

447
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,639
Rym: Yeah, but no, it wasn't.

448
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,780
Rym: It was very much a, "Oh, it's easy to die.

449
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,974
Rym: You actually have to be really careful and have some decent

450
00:27:14,994 --> 00:27:15,275
Rym: skills.".

451
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:16,289
Scott: Mm-hmm.

452
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:24,379
Rym: Now, the main gimmick of the game, it starts out with a silly, funny, yet unavoidable, unskippable opening movie.

453
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:25,198
Scott: Oh no.

454
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,779
Rym: You can't even speed up the text.

455
00:27:27,542 --> 00:27:29,757
Scott: Oh, there's no option for like text.

456
00:27:29,777 --> 00:27:30,200
Rym: speed fast?

457
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:30,740
Rym: No, no, no.

458
00:27:31,292 --> 00:27:31,399
Scott: Oh.

459
00:27:32,422 --> 00:27:35,180
Rym: And there seems to be some sort of plot, but I don't really care about that.

460
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:40,120
Rym: Basically, the princess is out for a walk, and Bowser finds this item, this magic wand.

461
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:49,080
Rym: So they send this Goomba to the Mushroom Kingdom to wave the wand around, and apparently it does some magic, and then they catch Mario and Luigi and Toad and take him back.

462
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,859
Rym: And the princess comes back, finds out that they're gone, and decides to go rescue them.

463
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:57,480
Rym: So she takes Perry, her little parasol, puts him over her shoulder, and heads out.

464
00:27:57,941 --> 00:27:58,620
Scott: Where's Toadsworth?

465
00:27:59,402 --> 00:28:00,280
Rym: He is in jail.

466
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:01,660
Rym: Everyone is in jail.

467
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,860
Rym: Bowser took everyone prisoner.

468
00:28:04,404 --> 00:28:04,960
Scott: Even Toadsworth?

469
00:28:05,281 --> 00:28:06,400
Rym: Everyone in the Mushroom Kingdom.

470
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:12,240
Rym: Except, apparently, the proprietor of the Mushroom Shop, where I go purchase better umbrellas.

471
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:13,576
Scott: What?

472
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,600
Scott: But I thought your umbrella was like actually a living umbrella.

473
00:28:16,842 --> 00:28:16,978
Scott: Perry.

474
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:17,458
Rym: Oh, it is.

475
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,480
Rym: I'm not sure what I'm purchasing, but they add powers to Perry.

476
00:28:20,921 --> 00:28:22,600
Scott: Oh, so it doesn't actually replace him.

477
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:24,119
Scott: It just upgrades him.

478
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:32,577
Rym: Now, gameplay-wise, the gimmick is that the princess can be, and this is kind of sexist, but it's funny, in any of four moods.

479
00:28:33,121 --> 00:28:35,759
Rym: And you can choose a mood on the touchscreen at any given time.

480
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:43,877
Rym: But as you're in a mood, depending on how you're using that mood, you have a mood meter, or a vibe meter, they call it vibe, that slowly goes down.

481
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,620
Rym: And when it hits zero, you can't go into any mood, and you're just normal Princess Peach.

482
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,520
Rym: Normal Princess Peach is just kind of wide-eyed.

483
00:28:52,881 --> 00:28:55,634
Rym: Now there's joy, rage, gloom, and calm.

484
00:28:56,961 --> 00:29:01,358
Rym: Because apparently, according to Nintendo, these are the only four emotions that a female can ever attain.

485
00:29:03,561 --> 00:29:12,840
Rym: Now, they each have powers, and I've got to say right now, the best part of this game, hands down, no matter what I find at the end, is the joy power.

486
00:29:13,441 --> 00:29:15,480
Rym: Because when she is joyful, she flies.

487
00:29:15,861 --> 00:29:16,540
Rym: All right, no big deal.

488
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,959
Rym: You hold down A and she starts floating up.

489
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:29,397
Rym: Now if you hold down A and start floating up, and then you let go, and coupled with a little animation of her flailing her arms around and smiling, it's probably the cutest thing I've ever seen in a video game ever.

490
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,960
Scott: Yeah, because the princess really isn't that cute, so I know the game must cutify her a lot.

491
00:29:36,222 --> 00:29:36,858
Rym: Oh, it does.

492
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:44,980
Rym: Like, if you put her in angry mode, she furrows her brow and frumps a bit, and then she starts stomping around on fire.

493
00:29:46,287 --> 00:29:46,820
Scott: On fire.

494
00:29:47,084 --> 00:29:47,539
Rym: On fire.

495
00:29:48,021 --> 00:29:54,240
Rym: If you make her sad, her tears, basically a Niagara Falls of tears flies out from her face in all directions.

496
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,860
Scott: It sounds a lot like Wario Land 2.

497
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:04,600
Rym: It's a lot like Wario games, in that you have life, and you can die, though, but if you die, you just have to redo whatever stage you're on.

498
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,881
Scott: Only Wario 1, which is more like Mario Land 3.

499
00:30:08,881 --> 00:30:10,921
Scott: Actually was Mario Land 3.

500
00:30:10,921 --> 00:30:11,418
Scott: Could you die?

501
00:30:12,322 --> 00:30:14,220
Scott: Starting with Wario Land 2, you couldn't die.

502
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,500
Rym: I'm pretty sure you could die in the second Wario game for the Game Boy.

503
00:30:18,606 --> 00:30:19,080
Scott: No, you couldn't.

504
00:30:19,461 --> 00:30:20,240
Rym: I'm pretty sure you could.

505
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:20,699
Rym: I've got it.

506
00:30:20,781 --> 00:30:21,230
Scott: Nope, I'm 100% sure.

507
00:30:21,781 --> 00:30:23,440
Scott: Wario Land 2, you could not die.

508
00:30:24,421 --> 00:30:28,260
Rym: Alright, well, we'll have to verify that later, because I've got the game laying around somewhere.

509
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,099
Scott: Oh, really?

510
00:30:29,562 --> 00:30:30,079
Rym: Yeah, really.

511
00:30:30,642 --> 00:30:31,478
Scott: Oh, because that's the best one.

512
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:32,740
Rym: I liked it a lot.

513
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:33,520
Scott: Yeah.

514
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,946
Scott: But no, in those games, Wario

515
00:30:35,986 --> 00:30:43,614
Scott: would, like, if he got bit by a bat, he would turn into a vampire, and then if he ate a cake, he would get fat,

516
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:49,940
Scott: and if he sat on fire, he would get fiery, and you could get all these different things, but you couldn't do them by just choosing them.

517
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:54,839
Scott: You had to go to the right spot to get them, and then you would need that power to continue to a certain area.

518
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,080
Rym: Yeah.

519
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,920
Rym: Now, the game, I mean, it's just a typical platformer.

520
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:04,960
Rym: The puzzles are laughably simple at first, and they don't seem to get any more difficult.

521
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,240
Rym: The boss fights are actually kind of interesting.

522
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,079
Rym: The only problem is, they tell you how to beat the boss before every boss.

523
00:31:11,164 --> 00:31:12,100
Scott: Uh, even the end boss?

524
00:31:12,845 --> 00:31:13,659
Rym: I haven't gotten that far.

525
00:31:13,945 --> 00:31:14,259
Scott: Oh, okay.

526
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:23,056
Rym: But so far, every boss, I've had a little information block that I hit, and it always tells me, "Oh, if you fill him with water and then ground pound him,

527
00:31:23,076 --> 00:31:23,237
Rym: haha.".

528
00:31:25,017 --> 00:31:25,059
Scott: Oh.

529
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,520
Scott: Well, that's how you beat the first boss in Mario Sunshine.

530
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:28,216
Rym: Yeah.

531
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:30,920
Rym: It's a giant Petey the Piranha.

532
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:31,429
Scott: Yep.

533
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:34,940
Scott: What's the boss that you fill with water and ground pound in Princess Peach?

534
00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:36,639
Rym: Uh, that's it.

535
00:31:37,123 --> 00:31:37,520
Rym: Same guy.

536
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,700
Scott: It's also Petey the Piranha?

537
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,218
Scott: Yes, it is.

538
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,079
Scott: You beat him the same way?

539
00:31:40,422 --> 00:31:41,360
Rym: You beat him the same way.

540
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,359
Scott: Couldn't they think of something new?

541
00:31:42,681 --> 00:31:45,000
Rym: And then after you beat him, the toad that he's eaten pops out.

542
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:45,679
Scott: Uh-huh.

543
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,377
Scott: He ate a toad?

544
00:31:46,842 --> 00:31:50,679
Rym: Now, the one thing about this game, other than that, is that the princess has the four moods, right?

545
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,940
Rym: These moods or vibes are, I guess, central to this game.

546
00:31:54,780 --> 00:32:00,853
Rym: Because, you run into Goombas, you know, standard Goombas, but any Goomba you run into is going to be in one of these four moods.

547
00:32:02,101 --> 00:32:06,378
Rym: So, the joyful Goomba is just kind of like walking around singing a song to himself all happy.

548
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,640
Scott: Wait, wait, I think I figured out what happened.

549
00:32:09,301 --> 00:32:11,060
Scott: That Goomba that waved the magic wand?

550
00:32:11,348 --> 00:32:11,560
Scott: Yeah.

551
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,340
Scott: That was like the estrogen wand, right?

552
00:32:15,929 --> 00:32:16,558
Scott: Is that what it was?

553
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,120
Scott: Is that what Nintendo's trying to tell us?

554
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,060
Rym: Well, what happens is it's the vibe wand.

555
00:32:21,069 --> 00:32:21,900
Scott: Ah, so I was right.

556
00:32:22,521 --> 00:32:25,819
Rym: And he waves it around in the Mushroom Kingdom and everyone gets all screwed up.

557
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,300
Rym: And as a result of that, Bowser can just walk over and, you know, capture everyone.

558
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,940
Scott: Well, everyone's freaking crying, laughing, and flying and stuff.

559
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:39,858
Rym: So, the Goomba comes back and then he just decides to make some mischief and waves it around in Bowser's Kingdom too.

560
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,122
Scott: Oh.

561
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:44,857
Rym: So, you'll be walking around and there's a happy Goomba and you kill him.

562
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:50,477
Rym: And then you see a sad Goomba and he's just running back and forth crying hysterically and you kill him.

563
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,539
Scott: Then you kill them no matter what their mood is?

564
00:32:52,601 --> 00:32:53,340
Scott: You kill everything.

565
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,497
Rym: This game's kind of horrible in that regard.

566
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,079
Scott: Even the happy Goombas?

567
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,480
Scott: Won't the happy Goombas leave you alone because they're so happy?

568
00:32:59,881 --> 00:33:01,540
Rym: They will, but if you run into them it still hurts.

569
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,580
Rym: I guess Goombas are poisonous.

570
00:33:03,261 --> 00:33:04,620
Scott: Oh, so you freaking kill everyone.

571
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:08,700
Rym: But, I mean, the game gets to the point where at one point there's these happy flowers.

572
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:11,560
Rym: Like, happy, singing, cartoon flowers.

573
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,320
Scott: Piranha flowers?

574
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,880
Rym: No, just normal flowers.

575
00:33:14,304 --> 00:33:14,476
Scott: Alright.

576
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:20,579
Rym: And the only way to progress is to hit them so that all of their petals fall off and now they're sad, crying flowers.

577
00:33:21,845 --> 00:33:23,079
Scott: What is the explanation for this?

578
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,660
Rym: The explanation for this is... Fucking flowers?

579
00:33:26,822 --> 00:33:27,217
Rym: I hate them.

580
00:33:27,681 --> 00:33:28,075
Rym: I don't know.

581
00:33:28,581 --> 00:33:29,280
Rym: You kill flowers.

582
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:40,979
Rym: The game is very fun for a little kid, but it's fun for someone like us because you play the game and you're this cute princess in this cute world, but you're wreaking death and destruction with every step you take.

583
00:33:42,388 --> 00:33:42,680
Scott: Awesome.

584
00:33:43,843 --> 00:33:44,379
Scott: Where's Mario?

585
00:33:45,181 --> 00:33:46,580
Rym: Mario was in Bowser's dungeon.

586
00:33:46,823 --> 00:33:47,199
Scott: Oh, right.

587
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:48,298
Scott: With everyone else.

588
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:49,159
Rym: Yeah.

589
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,880
Rym: And so was Toad and Luigi and I assume everyone else.

590
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,360
Scott: Are they making sangria and turlet?

591
00:33:54,187 --> 00:33:54,759
Scott: Of course.

592
00:33:55,387 --> 00:33:55,618
Scott: Awesome.

593
00:33:57,061 --> 00:33:58,574
Scott: Are they crying also or is it...

594
00:33:59,561 --> 00:34:03,500
Rym: Luigi was crying, Toad was bawling, and Mario just has this sad look on his face.

595
00:34:03,621 --> 00:34:04,717
Scott: Luigi's always crying.

596
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:05,920
Rym: Yeah, Luigi.

597
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,760
Rym: It's a me, a Mario.

598
00:34:09,704 --> 00:34:09,936
Scott: Luigi.

599
00:34:11,562 --> 00:34:11,719
Rym: Alright.

600
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:19,179
Rym: Now, I guess I'll talk about the game again when I beat it and if it actually gets more difficult, but I gotta say, I wouldn't rush out to buy this game.

601
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:22,418
Rym: It's definitely not worth paying full price for the day it comes out.

602
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:27,020
Rym: However, if you want a DS game to play, it's fun.

603
00:34:27,664 --> 00:34:28,398
Rym: I'm enjoying it.

604
00:34:29,463 --> 00:34:30,918
Rym: I don't know what else I can say about it.

605
00:34:32,061 --> 00:34:44,699
Scott: I can say that what you should probably do is wait till the end of this month and buy Tetris DS and Metroid Hunters and then in a couple months when there's a drought of DS games, go get this one for $20 or $25.

606
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:45,579
Rym: You know what's really funny though?

607
00:34:46,141 --> 00:34:47,679
Rym: I bought this and I was gonna buy it new.

608
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,619
Rym: I went to the GameStop and I bought Princess Peach and I didn't even go over to the area where the games were.

609
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,536
Rym: I just walked up and said, "Give me a copy of Princess

610
00:34:54,556 --> 00:34:54,757
Rym: Peach.".

611
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:02,340
Rym: So he walks over to the used game area, picks a game up, and comes back over and says, "Here, I gave you this used copy of Princess Peach.

612
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,640
Rym: Someone bought it and brought it back two days later.

613
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:05,980
Scott: No wonder why they did that.

614
00:35:06,367 --> 00:35:06,679
Rym: I don't know.

615
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,580
Rym: It was in mint condition.

616
00:35:08,321 --> 00:35:08,488
Scott: Oh, good.

617
00:35:09,121 --> 00:35:10,660
Rym: There wasn't even a save game on it or anything.

618
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,039
Scott: Might as well not be used then.

619
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,699
Rym: Yeah, so I saved five bucks.

620
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:14,280
Scott: That's right.

621
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:24,450
Scott: Someone bought it and brought it to someone and then the person was like, "Oh, maybe they bought it as a gift for someone who didn't have a DS or maybe they bought it for someone who didn't want it,".

622
00:35:24,754 --> 00:35:25,220
Scott: or who knows?

623
00:35:26,361 --> 00:35:28,479
Rym: Yeah, well, if that was the case, they could have just returned it.

624
00:35:29,141 --> 00:35:31,879
Rym: This means that someone opened it, played it, and then took it back.

625
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,640
Scott: No, because they might have opened it and then- Yeah, they opened it at least.

626
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:35,236
Scott: Yeah.

627
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,380
Scott: Then you had to sell it back.

628
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,060
Scott: You can't really return.

629
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:40,040
Rym: Hey, it saves me five bucks and GameStop made a bunch of money off that.

630
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,800
Scott: Yeah, GameStop made a lot of money off that.

631
00:35:41,941 --> 00:35:43,020
Scott: They sold the same thing twice.

632
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:51,292
Scott: They profit a few bucks and they sell it and then they buy it back for 10 bucks and then they sell it, get 15 more bucks, 25 bucks.

633
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,292
Rym: Yeah, they sold it for 30 used.

634
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:54,284
Scott: Wow.

635
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:54,865
Scott: It was 35 new.

636
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:56,860
Scott: Wow, yeah.

637
00:35:57,226 --> 00:35:57,898
Scott: They made a lot of money.

638
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,720
Rym: So, I'm dividing my time currently between Princess Peach and the last chapter of Phoenix Wright.

639
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:20,900
Scott: Yeah, finish at Phoenix Wright, which is, if you didn't know, everyone, Phoenix Wright, supposedly tomorrow, which it could be today if you're listening on Tuesday, Wednesday, they're supposedly re-shipping new copies of Phoenix Wright to game stores everywhere.

640
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,880
Scott: So, check your local game stores if you don't have Phoenix Wright.

641
00:36:24,041 --> 00:36:24,739
Scott: It could be there.

642
00:36:25,042 --> 00:36:26,219
Rym: It's about frickin' time.

643
00:36:26,562 --> 00:36:29,040
Scott: Yeah, and now they frickin' realize it's popular.

644
00:36:29,161 --> 00:36:29,767
Scott: Give us some more.

645
00:36:29,827 --> 00:36:31,120
Scott: damn Phoenix Wright, god damn it.

646
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,512
Rym: Yeah, I want every Phoenix Wright that was ever released ever in the world to come on my DS.

647
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,940
Scott: I want absolutely every Phoenix Wright ever.

648
00:36:37,442 --> 00:36:39,420
Rym: And then, as soon as I beat the last one, I want a new one.

649
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,220
Scott: I want Phoenix Wright constantly.

650
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:47,478
Scott: I want so much Phoenix Wright that I can keep buying new Phoenix Wright without having a break.

651
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,620
Scott: I would always currently be in a Phoenix Wright episode.

652
00:36:51,522 --> 00:36:54,100
Rym: I hate to use an old inside joke, but I have a vision.

653
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:55,820
Rym: I have a vision.

654
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:56,800
Scott: Oh, yes, a vision.

655
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,480
Scott: Is it a row of poison mushrooms?

656
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,354
Rym: No, no, no.

657
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:08,880
Rym: This is a vision of Phoenix Wright on the revolution where I can take that baton and point my god damn finger at a prosecuting attorney.

658
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,698
Scott: Yeah, we'll probably have that.

659
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:12,199
Rym: And with the microphone, I can yell.

660
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,600
Rym: Of course, you can do that in the DS version.

661
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:15,845
Rym: I don't.

662
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,480
Rym: Mainly because people on the train would probably not be too pleased with me.

663
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,580
Scott: You know what they really need?

664
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,628
Scott: They need Phoenix Wright where it's you versus someone else and you don't know who's gonna win.

665
00:37:24,105 --> 00:37:24,898
Rym: That'd be tough to do.

666
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,940
Scott: It would be tough to do, but I think it could be done.

667
00:37:27,901 --> 00:37:28,539
Scott: And it would be awesome.

668
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,499
Scott: Like, choose your lawyer.

669
00:37:30,984 --> 00:37:31,640
Scott: Like a fighting game.

670
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:45,520
Rym: Or they just give you random cases and there's, or they give you random testimonies and there's contradictions all over and it's just a race to see who finds the most contradictions or beats the other guy or something.

671
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,939
Scott: Well, maybe what you want to do is you want to find the contradictions that help you but don't help the other guy.

672
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:57,978
Rym: Yeah, because Phoenix Wright, it's very linear currently and there's a lot of times where you'll bark down the wrong path and it ends up helping the other guy.

673
00:37:58,018 --> 00:37:58,820
Rym: but that's part of the script.

674
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,637
Rym: You really can't avoid it.

675
00:38:00,423 --> 00:38:01,460
Scott: Phoenix Wright is just a linear game.

676
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:06,700
Rym: Because a lot of times I'm playing Phoenix Wright and I'll think, "I don't want to talk about this thing because that's bad for my client.

677
00:38:07,582 --> 00:38:09,500
Rym: Oh, but I have to talk about it or the game won't progress.

678
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:10,600
Scott: Crap.".

679
00:38:10,741 --> 00:38:20,100
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty much every testimony is a circle and then you find a way to use evidence and the press button to break out of the circle into the next circle of testimony.

680
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,260
Scott: And eventually you just get through the whole game.

681
00:38:23,021 --> 00:38:26,178
Rym: Most of what the game's got going for it is just the hilariousness of it.

682
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,719
Scott: That's what it's all about.

683
00:38:28,984 --> 00:38:32,520
Scott: It's like watching a really good anime about awesome lawyering.

684
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:33,679
Scott: Not a really good anime.

685
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,140
Rym: A completely silly anime.

686
00:38:35,562 --> 00:38:36,279
Scott: It's fantastic.

687
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,980
Scott: If it was an anime, I would watch every episode.

688
00:38:38,421 --> 00:38:38,738
Rym: You know what?

689
00:38:38,862 --> 00:38:39,318
Rym: I would too.

690
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,360
Scott: Yeah, so there you go.

691
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:46,880
Scott: But at the same time, you're pushing buttons and figuring out which evidence to use to make the anime confusing.

692
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,234
Rym: Yeah, there's also a decent game there.

693
00:38:49,106 --> 00:38:50,539
Scott: But I gotta say- I'm in San Diego style.

694
00:38:50,622 --> 00:38:51,020
Scott: Yeah.

695
00:38:51,061 --> 00:38:52,240
Rym: Every now and then I'd get stuck.

696
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:57,438
Rym: I'd be sitting there watching the video of a murder over and over again thinking, "Alright, I'm stuck.

697
00:38:57,923 --> 00:38:58,236
Rym: I can't.

698
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:58,606
Rym: What the

699
00:38:58,627 --> 00:38:58,832
Rym: hell?".

700
00:38:59,261 --> 00:39:06,300
Rym: And then you notice something and when you find that little piece of evidence that you needed or you figure it out and you point your finger and yell, it's a great feeling.

701
00:39:07,002 --> 00:39:07,069
Scott: Yep.

702
00:39:08,022 --> 00:39:10,000
Scott: Unless the judge yells at you, then you did wrong.

703
00:39:12,787 --> 00:39:13,239
Rym: Wow, yeah.

704
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:18,319
Rym: You know, Phoenix Wright must be a good game if we keep going back to it when we're trying to talk about other games.

705
00:39:18,902 --> 00:39:25,060
Scott: It's like this weird- it's like- I don't know what it is about this game, but it's not like a crazy hit that everyone's talking about.

706
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,080
Scott: But at the same time, everyone's in on it.

707
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:36,334
Scott: Like, you keep seeing Phoenix Wright references all over the internet and you keep seeing people making Phoenix Wright jokes and people saying, "Phoenix Wright,

708
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:37,137
Scott: ooh!"

709
00:39:37,318 --> 00:39:40,380
Scott: on blogs and stuff, but you don't see it in video game magazines.

710
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,438
Scott: You don't see it on TV.

711
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,260
Scott: You don't- you know.

712
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,760
Scott: It's sort of like this underground mega hit.

713
00:39:45,901 --> 00:39:51,500
Rym: Well, I gotta say, when I was in Katsucon, I was playing Phoenix Wright, and someone came over and they asked me what game I was playing.

714
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,615
Rym: And I said, "Phoenix

715
00:39:52,635 --> 00:39:52,840
Rym: Wright.".

716
00:39:52,901 --> 00:39:54,020
Rym: He said, "What, that lawyer game?

717
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:54,490
Rym: That sounded

718
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:54,837
Rym: stupid.".

719
00:39:55,304 --> 00:39:56,418
Rym: And I just said, "Here, you play

720
00:39:56,459 --> 00:39:56,499
Rym: it.".

721
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,740
Rym: And I let him play the first mission a little bit, and he was sold.

722
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,539
Rym: He tried to buy it, like, that day.

723
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,760
Scott: I think we already talked about Phoenix Wright enough.

724
00:40:04,061 --> 00:40:05,920
Scott: I think- didn't we do an episode about Phoenix Wright?

725
00:40:05,941 --> 00:40:06,519
Rym: I think we did.

726
00:40:06,924 --> 00:40:07,180
Scott: Awesome.

727
00:40:07,482 --> 00:40:07,590
Scott: Yeah.

728
00:40:08,561 --> 00:40:09,760
Scott: So, Mega Man X is cool.

729
00:40:10,363 --> 00:40:14,280
Rym: Super Princess Peach is more fun than you'd expect, and cuter than you can imagine.

730
00:40:15,241 --> 00:40:20,060
Scott: And later this month, we'll definitely have some Tetris and Metroid going on, full force.

731
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,920
Rym: Yeah, I'm really kind of excited about Metroid.

732
00:40:22,121 --> 00:40:23,099
Scott: I'm excited about Tetris.

733
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:25,880
Rym: I played Tetris, and you know what?

734
00:40:25,981 --> 00:40:26,538
Rym: It's Tetris.

735
00:40:27,221 --> 00:40:28,420
Scott: That's exactly what I want.

736
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,099
Scott: Hells yes.

737
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,600
Rym: It's also got other stuff in it, but the Tetris part alone is enough.

738
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,117
Scott: Internet Tetris.

739
00:40:36,963 --> 00:40:40,180
Scott: That people actually play with me, because no one wants to play Tetranet for some reason.

740
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:43,940
Rym: The genius of this is that Nintendo is selling a game.

741
00:40:44,763 --> 00:40:46,320
Rym: They're selling basically just Tetris.

742
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,399
Rym: It's got bells and whistles, but it's Tetris.

743
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,046
Rym: For 35 bucks.

744
00:40:50,601 --> 00:40:51,593
Rym: And we're all gonna buy it.

745
00:40:51,856 --> 00:40:52,120
Rym: Again.

746
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:57,680
Scott: Well, we bought- it was the- Nintendo made its first huge cash monies on the Game Boy Tetris.

747
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,520
Scott: I mean, that's how the Game Boy beat the Game Gear, Tetris.

748
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:01,209
Rym: Yep.

749
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:05,859
Rym: Well, also, uh, cheaper price, longer battery life, better games, more games.

750
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:09,540
Scott: They shut out Tengen with a good Tetris, as opposed to shitty Tengen Tetris.

751
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,020
Rym: Yep.

752
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,979
Scott: And now they're gonna shut out everyone else again by putting Tetris in the DS.

753
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,880
Scott: They could put- you put Tetris on your system, you win.

754
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:17,717
Scott: That's how it works.

755
00:41:19,322 --> 00:41:21,899
Scott: Notice how no other system has had Tetris except Nintendo systems.

756
00:41:22,302 --> 00:41:22,820
Scott: And computers.

757
00:41:24,225 --> 00:41:24,939
Scott: And arcade machines.

758
00:41:26,543 --> 00:41:28,380
Rym: Those crazy Japanese Tetris machines.

759
00:41:29,102 --> 00:41:30,919
Scott: Oh god, I wanna play one of those, just to see.

760
00:41:31,225 --> 00:41:31,459
Rym: Yeah.

761
00:41:32,325 --> 00:41:33,680
Rym: We had that video way back.

762
00:41:33,982 --> 00:41:36,560
Rym: I don't think we were even doing GeekNights when we found that video.

763
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,499
Scott: No, that was a long time ago.

764
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:37,881
Rym: Yeah.

765
00:41:38,102 --> 00:41:42,560
Rym: It's a video of this guy playing Tetris on- Like, you know if you see Dance Dance Revolution?

766
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,080
Rym: The crazy, super, oni, whatever, challenge, crap, crazy mode.

767
00:41:46,742 --> 00:41:49,900
Rym: And there's, like, the crazy lead guy doing it with a perfect, you know, perfect every step.

768
00:41:50,442 --> 00:41:51,540
Rym: Or a marvelous every step.

769
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,140
Rym: Imagine that, only it's Tetris.

770
00:41:55,901 --> 00:42:04,780
Scott: And he's playing some crazy, like, Tetris Revolution number 7 in some Japanese arcade, which is like this ultra version of Tetris.

771
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,660
Rym: It looks like The Legend of Max, only it's Tetris.

772
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:14,220
Scott: Yeah, it's got all sorts of Tetris features, and it's super fast, and- And there's a crowd around this guy yelling and screaming.

773
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:17,879
Scott: I didn't think there was a crowd, I thought the guy was alone, it didn't sound- There were people there.

774
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,220
Scott: I don't think there was a crowd, there was a guy videotaping, obviously.

775
00:42:20,582 --> 00:42:21,600
Rym: I think it was part of a tournament.

776
00:42:22,162 --> 00:42:24,660
Scott: It didn't look like it to me, it looked like a guy in some schmuck arcade.

777
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,320
Scott: Maybe we'll have to go find it again.

778
00:42:26,521 --> 00:42:27,999
Rym: We should, it'll be a thing of the day next week.

779
00:42:28,303 --> 00:42:29,239
Scott: If we can find it again.

780
00:42:29,601 --> 00:42:31,280
Rym: It's gotta be out there on Google Video somewhere.

781
00:42:31,362 --> 00:42:31,956
Scott: It has to be.

782
00:42:39,101 --> 00:42:41,200
Rym: And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

783
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,839
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

789

Scott: GeekNights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

790
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:14,540
Scott: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
