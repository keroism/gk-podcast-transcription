1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,399
Rym: It's Thursday, November 16th.

2
00:00:11,801 --> 00:00:12,203
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,383 --> 00:00:12,966
Scott: And I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,086 --> 00:00:14,090
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,846
Rym: Tonight we talk a bit about standing in line.

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:19,969
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:27,510
Rym: So we came home today to a somewhat startling and disheartening situation with the computers in our house.

8
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:32,728
Scott: Apparently we have a server in our house, and this server does a few things.

9
00:00:32,788 --> 00:00:39,930
Scott: Number one, it has a web server on it so that we can, you know, make websites for pretend before putting them on our real hosting.

10
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,843
Scott: You know, it's where we're designing the new frontrowcrew.com and all that.

11
00:00:43,285 --> 00:00:46,950
Scott: It's got DNS, so it turns domain names into IP addresses.

12
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,401
Rym: I don't think we need to explain what all those things are.

13
00:00:49,461 --> 00:00:52,689
Scott: Right, and it gives all the computers in the rest of the house IP addresses with DHCP.

14
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:59,635
Scott: We got home, and my computer wasn't connected to the internets, and the cable modem while the lights were on, which means it's a problem.

15
00:00:59,996 --> 00:01:00,679
Scott: A big problem.

16
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,634
Scott: I checked the server, and of course, it's broken.

17
00:01:05,194 --> 00:01:05,917
Scott: Totally broken.

18
00:01:05,917 --> 00:01:07,341
Scott: 100% broken.

19
00:01:07,662 --> 00:01:10,610
Rym: So pretty much the moment we got an extra computer.

20
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,923
Rym: We had more computers than we had uses for computers.

21
00:01:14,445 --> 00:01:15,450
Rym: One of the computers died.

22
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:24,863
Rym: Now, I note that the computer that died is not my going on seven years old computer that I built in high school that I'm still using to record this podcast.

23
00:01:25,024 --> 00:01:26,690
Scott: No, it's a computer that Pete gave to us.

24
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,642
Rym: Yeah, way to go Pete, building that computer.

25
00:01:30,265 --> 00:01:31,089
Scott: It is dead now.

26
00:01:32,053 --> 00:01:33,710
Scott: I'll bet these parts of it is still good.

27
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,922
Rym: I'll bet there was some sort of cooling failure because well, I think there was.

28
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:46,210
Rym: Well after Scott had unplugged it, turned it off and everything, I was poking around at it, and the CPU and the heat sink around the CPU were hot enough to hurt when I touched them.

29
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:57,183
Scott: It definitely seemed like there was a heating failure, but at the same time, that was the first thing I suspected, and it looked inside the case while the computer was on, and all the fans are working just fine, so I really have no clue.

30
00:01:57,745 --> 00:01:58,408
Rym: Yeah, whatever.

31
00:01:58,649 --> 00:01:58,890
Scott: Whatever.

32
00:01:59,050 --> 00:01:59,552
Scott: It's dead.

33
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:04,850
Rym: We ordered a very large hard drive, and we're gonna be cobbling something together in short order.

34
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:08,723
Scott: Yeah, in the meantime, we don't have DHCP or DNS in our house.

35
00:02:08,764 --> 00:02:12,073
Scott: We're using the ISP services.

36
00:02:12,354 --> 00:02:14,841
Rym: Yeah, so we still have DHCP in the house at least.

37
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:16,385
Scott: Yeah, in the router though.

38
00:02:16,626 --> 00:02:18,110
Rym: So, works just fine.

39
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,926
Scott: Yeah, it's a little harder to do DNS in the house, you know, the local DNS.

40
00:02:23,407 --> 00:02:25,795
Rym: Well, it's not harder, it's just there's no local DNS.

41
00:02:25,835 --> 00:02:26,537
Scott: Yeah, it sucks.

42
00:02:26,758 --> 00:02:30,610
Scott: I had to do SSH space IP address instead of SSH space name.

43
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,182
Rym: Oh, no, saving extra characters.

44
00:02:33,283 --> 00:02:34,489
Scott: It is, it's a lot of extra effort.

45
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:41,770
Rym: Yeah, though also, I drove home during a giant thunderstorm that was going for the last several hours.

46
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,999
Scott: I got home just before the giant thunderstorm.

47
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,850
Rym: A semi-truck was almost blown over my car.

48
00:02:47,591 --> 00:02:48,052
Rym: Awesome.

49
00:02:48,193 --> 00:02:54,616
Rym: As I was driving, and I was next to the semi, and I decided that in light of all the wind, I would not sit next to the semi.

50
00:02:54,656 --> 00:02:56,262
Rym: So I, you know, slowed down and pulled back.

51
00:02:56,643 --> 00:03:06,650
Rym: And not 20 or 30 seconds later, a big gust of wind blew my car half out of its lane, suddenly, and blew the semi two lanes across.

52
00:03:07,652 --> 00:03:08,778
Scott: Whoa, did the semi hit anything?

53
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:09,784
Rym: No, it didn't hit anything.

54
00:03:09,824 --> 00:03:10,427
Rym: It just kind of went,

55
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:10,709
Rym: "Roo."

56
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:16,030
Rym: It did like, I thought it was gonna jackknife, but it just kind of got back straight and kept going.

57
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,735
Scott: Way to go, semi-driver.

58
00:03:17,816 --> 00:03:18,860
Rym: No one even reacted.

59
00:03:19,382 --> 00:03:19,843
Scott: Way to go.

60
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:21,550
Scott: Yeah, good driving skills.

61
00:03:21,973 --> 00:03:23,342
Rym: I actually also got pulled over.

62
00:03:23,383 --> 00:03:24,370
Rym: I didn't get a ticket or anything.

63
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,689
Scott: Why'd you get pulled over?

64
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,070
Rym: I was going like a hundred.

65
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,368
Scott: And what did he say?

66
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,889
Rym: It wasn't even a, it was a, like, it was a cop dressed up really nice, like in a suit.

67
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,938
Rym: And he was in an undercover cop car.

68
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:37,329
Rym: And he was like, "Eh, slow it down a

69
00:03:37,369 --> 00:03:37,530
Rym: bit.".

70
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,208
Rym: And he just let me go.

71
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,530
Scott: So if he's in an undercover car in the state of New York, he can't give you a ticket.

72
00:03:41,996 --> 00:03:42,209
Scott: Yeah.

73
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:46,290
Scott: And can only in a marked car in New York state can someone give you a ticket.

74
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,310
Rym: See, I grew up in Michigan where cops can pull you over from anything.

75
00:03:49,551 --> 00:03:51,016
Scott: That totally got me in Jersey.

76
00:03:51,036 --> 00:03:52,381
Scott: They had an undercover car.

77
00:03:52,562 --> 00:03:54,890
Scott: In New York state, only marked cars.

78
00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:01,009
Rym: Remember, New York state, though, has those pseudo undercover cars where they look like a normal car, but they have a little logo on the side.

79
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,304
Scott: As long as it's marked, they can get you.

80
00:04:03,505 --> 00:04:04,190
Scott: That's the law.

81
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:12,629
Rym: So they got these special cars, right, that have this logo that's like a shade darker than the car itself, and hidden lights and no lights on top.

82
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:18,390
Scott: Yeah, I'm not sure what the exact requirements for marking are, but yes, I have seen cars like that.

83
00:04:18,451 --> 00:04:20,790
Rym: I've seen those pull people over, but never on the commute.

84
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,210
Scott: Actually, the cops, they're getting way intense lately.

85
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:29,150
Rym: Oh, I've seen more cops on the road in the last two weeks than I've seen in the rest of my life.

86
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:35,350
Scott: There was a guy hiding on 84 in a hiding spot I didn't even know existed, even though I drive down that road every day almost.

87
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:56,330
Rym: Well, I'm not going to use this as my news, because I'm saving it for a much longer episode, but recently, Congress did a study about traffic tickets and speeding and revenue and all that, and the overwhelming evidence is that the majority of states in the US specifically use traffic enforcement as a way to pad out their budget.

88
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:04,030
Rym: And in fact, there's a direct correlation between financial difficulty in a state and increased traffic enforcement or lowered speed limits.

89
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,450
Scott: It's really just highway robbery and has more to do with money and less to do with safety.

90
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,829
Scott: Wait for into the future, we'll do an entire episode on it.

91
00:05:12,151 --> 00:05:17,110
Rym: Yeah, at least, I guess luckily, for all the times I've been pulled over, I've gotten very few tickets.

92
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:25,050
Rym: I mean, I got one in high school, and I got one a while ago, but compared to how many times I've sped and how many times I've been pulled over and not been given a ticket.

93
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,030
Scott: Yeah, I'm just going to play it safe for the next few weeks, I think.

94
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:28,756
Rym: Well, yeah.

95
00:05:29,421 --> 00:05:30,349
Scott: At least till the new year.

96
00:05:30,691 --> 00:05:31,862
Scott: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

97
00:05:31,882 --> 00:05:32,649
Scott: That's a few weeks.

98
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,190
Rym: I mean, the best thing is, a lot of states lately are admitting straight up that they have quotas.

99
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,849
Scott: Yeah, it's at least they say what they're doing, but... It's not cool.

100
00:05:40,012 --> 00:05:41,649
Scott: It's not cool, but hey.

101
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,310
Scott: Yeah, oh well, anyway.

102
00:05:43,753 --> 00:05:44,090
Scott: Anyway.

103
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,565
Rym: We could talk about the PS3.

104
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:46,506
Scott: We could.

105
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:47,947
Rym: There's all this news about the PS3.

106
00:05:48,211 --> 00:05:48,769
Scott: Oh, we're not gonna.

107
00:05:49,071 --> 00:05:49,870
Rym: I don't even care anymore.

108
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,930
Scott: It comes out tomorrow, so if you really want a PS3, tomorrow's the day.

109
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,650
Rym: If you really want a PS3, tomorrow's the day you should look on eBay.

110
00:05:57,171 --> 00:05:59,309
Rym: Because all the people in line are homeless bums in the US.

111
00:06:00,311 --> 00:06:00,479
Scott: Okay.

112
00:06:01,531 --> 00:06:06,130
Rym: Alright, so I got a nice, happy, warm, human interest kind of news today.

113
00:06:06,394 --> 00:06:06,689
Scott: Great.

114
00:06:07,031 --> 00:06:12,330
Rym: Mostly because I saw this news, and it reminded me that this sort of thing went on a lot back where I grew up in Michigan.

115
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:17,210
Rym: You see, there are two problems in a lot of the Midwest and Northeastern United States.

116
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:23,730
Rym: One, there are too many deer, to the point that deer will starve to death, and there are a lot of traffic accidents involving deer.

117
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,609
Rym: They're overpopulated.

118
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,430
Scott: I see deer all over the roads every single day.

119
00:06:27,832 --> 00:06:28,318
Rym: Remember RIT?

120
00:06:28,338 --> 00:06:29,229
Rym: There are more deer than students.

121
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:39,410
Scott: And the other problem is that in the Northeast, the population of hunters, you know, hunting people, there's not too many of them, as there are in other parts of the country, so they need people to hunt the deer, but there aren't enough hunters.

122
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:41,530
Rym: Well, there's a lot more to it than that.

123
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,690
Scott: Yeah, there's more to it, but I'm just saying it's another factor.

124
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:49,950
Rym: Now, number two, there are a lot of hungry people, a lot of poor people who can't afford food, a lot of homeless shelters that need meat.

125
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,179
Rym: Now, I used to go on a lot in Michigan.

126
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,370
Rym: I had relatives who took part in all this.

127
00:06:56,191 --> 00:07:02,790
Rym: But hunters would go out, and you'd get a special license that let you hunt as much as you wanted, or they were much more lax into how many deer you could get.

128
00:07:03,512 --> 00:07:15,530
Rym: And the catch was, you had to either dress the meat yourself and bring it to a shelter and donate it, or drop it off at these special volunteer places that would then dress the meat and donate it to the poor.

129
00:07:16,391 --> 00:07:18,728
Scott: Poor people eating plentiful deer makes sense to me.

130
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,310
Scott: Better than eating grains and things to get some meat.

131
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:24,370
Rym: Indiana is going one step further.

132
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,070
Rym: Hunters are volunteering to hunt and give the meat to the government.

133
00:07:28,471 --> 00:07:33,630
Rym: The government then takes the meat, puts it in prisons, and has prisoners prepare the meat.

134
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,910
Rym: It then gives that meat to the homeless.

135
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,629
Scott: Do the prisoners also eat it?

136
00:07:39,511 --> 00:07:39,952
Rym: You know what?

137
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:47,070
Rym: I would imagine, unless the people running the prison are the biggest assholes in the world, that the prisoners get at least some venison.

138
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:54,049
Scott: The only way I could see of making it better is if you had a chain gang of hunters, but I don't think you want to give guns to prisoners.

139
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,390
Scott: You would think that would be the best way.

140
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,450
Scott: You'd just have chain gangs do the hunting.

141
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:01,382
Scott: Wait a minute.

142
00:08:01,443 --> 00:08:01,709
Scott: Oops.

143
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,889
Rym: Cool Hand Luke says no.

144
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:11,870
Scott: It would almost be the perfect idea if it weren't for giving guns to crazy jail people.

145
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,425
Rym: So what's your non-PS3 news?

146
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:21,710
Scott: So a while ago, I think we were in Wildwood a couple years ago, and we were standing around an ATM machine as someone was getting money.

147
00:08:23,275 --> 00:08:25,084
Rym: I was about to kick your ass.

148
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:26,270
Rym: I was getting up.

149
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,210
Scott: I did it on purpose.

150
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:27,950
Rym: I'm sure.

151
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:32,166
Scott: Actually, I got pissed off some other podcasts at ATM Machine recently.

152
00:08:32,186 --> 00:08:33,010
Scott: I don't remember which one.

153
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:33,312
Rym: You know what?

154
00:08:33,474 --> 00:08:34,241
Rym: That's a bit shit.

155
00:08:34,402 --> 00:08:35,149
Rym: That's what that is.

156
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:47,030
Scott: So if you look, most ATMs, ones that are in banks are hooked up by a LAN, but ones that are out in the middle of nowhere or on boardwalks and all sorts of places have dial-up modems.

157
00:08:47,752 --> 00:08:55,430
Scott: Now, on this particular ATM, the phone line that connected the ATM to the world was exposed.

158
00:08:55,791 --> 00:09:01,230
Scott: I could have unplugged the ATM phone line from the wall, and the ATM would have not been able to contact the internet.

159
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,410
Scott: I thought, hey, wait a minute.

160
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:10,770
Scott: What if I put something in there between the ATM and the wall and recorded the ATM's conversation with the server?

161
00:09:11,391 --> 00:09:22,902
Scott: I should then be able to duplicate the server's side of the conversation and trick the ATM into spitting out money by making a device that the ATM thinks is the server.

162
00:09:23,203 --> 00:09:24,950
Scott: that is actually a device in my pocket.

163
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:28,190
Scott: And then the ATM spits out a bunch of money, and the bank never finds out.

164
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:34,530
Rym: Now, in keeping with the front row crew way of living, this turned into a multi-hour argument.

165
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:36,029
Scott: Over whether it would work.

166
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,710
Scott: Some people were saying, oh no, there's a challenge response security mechanism.

167
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:40,507
Scott: It'll never work.

168
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:49,570
Scott: You can't do it because you would introduce some sort of noise onto it with the device and the ATM.

169
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:50,446
Scott: It wouldn't work.

170
00:09:51,010 --> 00:10:00,549
Rym: What it basically came down to is that Scott's News, the people who did this, some ATMs are really shitty and didn't do this in a secure way at all.

171
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,910
Scott: I argued that it would work.

172
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,369
Scott: Other people argued that it didn't.

173
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:19,890
Scott: And this guy went and he took a digital audio player, basically an iPod, a digital audio player, and he recorded the ATM's conversation with the server, and he did some hacking to it, and he played it back, and he got all sorts of ATMs to spit out money.

174
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,050
Scott: Just ching ching ching ching.

175
00:10:21,691 --> 00:10:22,106
Scott: Badasses.

176
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,510
Scott: Super badass.

177
00:10:24,371 --> 00:10:26,250
Scott: Evil, stealing, but badass.

178
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,590
Rym: Yeah, I'm all for hacking in general.

179
00:10:29,652 --> 00:10:35,430
Rym: See, the thing is, this would be so easy to defeat by including a time-based checksum.

180
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:35,921
Rym: Yeah.

181
00:10:36,193 --> 00:10:36,450
Scott: That's it.

182
00:10:36,591 --> 00:10:37,129
Scott: Something like that.

183
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:37,562
Rym: Solved.

184
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,490
Scott: Or some sort of encryption.

185
00:10:42,544 --> 00:10:43,210
Scott: Oh my god.

186
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:53,110
Rym: Unless it used the exact same encryption every time per whatever the kind of transaction was, so if you played back the same recording, it would just do the same thing anyway.

187
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:57,730
Scott: Well, if you have encryption on top of a challenge response mechanism, you're all set.

188
00:10:58,213 --> 00:11:00,730
Rym: Yeah, but they didn't think of that apparently, or they didn't care.

189
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,990
Scott: The other thing is, this guy got money out of a bunch of different ATMs.

190
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:12,168
Scott: The security should be at least good enough that it only works on one ATM, and then you have to redo your whole hack for the next ATM.

191
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:13,866
Rym: See, I assumed...

192
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:19,990
Scott: Like, give each ATM a unique ID of some sort, or a private key of something inside the machine.

193
00:11:20,231 --> 00:11:22,870
Rym: I assumed that ATMs were a lot better secured than that.

194
00:11:23,452 --> 00:11:28,630
Scott: I guess they assumed that people aren't going to unplug them from the wall and snoop on the phone conversation.

195
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:43,350
Rym: Yeah, well, the basic tenet of security in IT, when it comes to networks and data communication, is basically that you must never, ever trust the actual wires that your information is going over.

196
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:50,650
Rym: You have to, when you're securing something, assume that any packet you send to anyone else can be read by everyone in the world and act accordingly.

197
00:11:51,513 --> 00:11:52,989
Scott: That's why I don't use regular old FTP.

198
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:57,670
Rym: That's why you use SSH, or SSL secured FTP, or all sorts of fun things.

199
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:58,163
Rym: Yes.

200
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:05,330
Rym: When it comes to movie reviews, what you want is intelligent, grown-up conversation.

201
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,348
Rym: If we hear any, we'll let you know.

202
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,929
Scott: Hey, Carstner, your Mac belongs to me.

203
00:12:15,351 --> 00:12:18,030
Rym: Movies you should see from Simply Syndicated.

204
00:12:18,773 --> 00:12:23,630
Rym: Find us at www.simplysyndicated.com/movies-you-should-see.

205
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:47,730
Rym: Normally this would be time for Things of the Day, but we have some breaking PlayStation 3 news that just has to get out there, because if you've been following what's been going on at all, there are some people lined up for PS3s, and some funny shit has been happening as a result.

206
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:51,110
Scott: There have been stoned guys robbing people in line.

207
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,349
Scott: There have been fights breaking out in the streets.

208
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,710
Scott: There are pregnant women waiting in line.

209
00:12:55,892 --> 00:12:57,648
Rym: Some guy was shooting BBs at people.

210
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:03,050
Scott: A guy was driving by a line of PS3 people, shooting a BB gun at them.

211
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:09,130
Scott: There is crazy shit going down all across the country, as people wait in line to get their PS3s tomorrow.

212
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:14,769
Scott: But one thing that happened just now takes the cake, and I must say, these are the smartest guys yet.

213
00:13:16,871 --> 00:13:21,389
Scott: At a GameStop in Elk Grove, I don't know what state, Doesn't matter.

214
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:36,846
Scott: Two gunmen went into the GameStop, held up the people at the store employees, and told them to bring out the PS3s, which are obviously in the back room, and they also took some Xbox 360s.

215
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,929
Scott: They got four of each, and they ran away.

216
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,369
Scott: Now, four people waiting in line killed themselves.

217
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,410
Rym: I just imagine you're standing in line.

218
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:52,490
Rym: You and me and Alex and Scott Johnson are standing in line at this thing.

219
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:55,110
Rym: We're all going to get our PS3 each, and we're standing there.

220
00:13:55,230 --> 00:14:07,866
Rym: We've been there for two days, and while we're standing there, these guys look like they're on a snatch walk-up, and they kick in the door and rush in, and then we're standing there, and five minutes later, they run out with the four PS3s.

221
00:14:08,896 --> 00:14:09,387
Rym: What do you do?

222
00:14:10,152 --> 00:14:11,624
Scott: You say, "Goddamn it, I'm stupid,".

223
00:14:11,644 --> 00:14:12,310
Scott: and they're smart.

224
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:12,968
Scott: Crime page.

225
00:14:14,672 --> 00:14:16,606
Rym: Yeah, I'd probably be thinking, "That could have been

226
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:16,768
Rym: me.".

227
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:21,210
Scott: Here's the thing, is you have basically mobs standing outside of stores.

228
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:22,750
Scott: I'm really surprised.

229
00:14:23,412 --> 00:14:34,730
Scott: It's pretty crazy what people are doing out in these lines, but it's obviously under control, because if it was out of control, these mobs would just rush the stores, beat up the employees, take the PS3s and the Wiis, and run away.

230
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,970
Rym: You mean like what kind of happened at that Walmart?

231
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:55,950
Scott: Well, what happened at the Walmart is that people were waiting in line, and they were told to leave after they had waited in line, so basically it meant that all their effort was for naught, so they got pissed, so they rushed the Walmart, and they pushed everything over, and they made a mess in the store, and the Walmart had to close, fix everything up, restore order, call the police, and then open again.

232
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,501
Rym: I love gamer fanboys.

233
00:14:57,743 --> 00:14:58,670
Rym: That's your response?

234
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:02,370
Rym: You're going to run into some guy's store and push over his shelf?

235
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:08,970
Scott: I think the real problem is that the managers of these stores do not know how to handle these lines.

236
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,330
Rym: Well, one, I know exactly how to handle lines.

237
00:15:12,651 --> 00:15:23,510
Rym: But more importantly, if I were the manager of a game store, one, I would have totally already done a scam with my employees I trusted to sell all the PS3s we got on the gray market.

238
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:24,569
Scott: That's what I would also do.

239
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:34,370
Rym: Make a giant pile of money, and then, and then, not only would I have hidden video cameras to tape what I would do, but I would absolutely torture the people in line.

240
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:37,086
Rym: I'd lie and say I had ten PS3s.

241
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:40,190
Rym: I'd let people line up weeks in advance.

242
00:15:40,592 --> 00:15:43,650
Rym: I'd bring them food and everything and act like it was all cool.

243
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:49,149
Rym: Then, the day of the PS3 release, I'd open the door and let a bunch of other people in.

244
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,488
Rym: I wouldn't let the people in line in.

245
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:57,190
Scott: See, what I would do is, first of all, I would try to do a scam to sell the PS3s and make a lot of money.

246
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:07,150
Scott: And then, if people came to wait in line, I'd let anyone who came to wait wait a little while, and I'd torture them, and then I would tell them the truth so that they didn't ruin their lives.

247
00:16:07,552 --> 00:16:12,984
Scott: And I would also teach them a lesson, like, wait, you know, like, don't be stupid and wait in line.

248
00:16:13,004 --> 00:16:13,669
Scott: Go get a job.

249
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:24,350
Scott: And then, also, if I couldn't pull a scam and get all the PS3s for myself and make money off of them, I would do is I would torture the line for days and days and days to teach them all a lesson.

250
00:16:24,912 --> 00:16:27,209
Scott: And then, at the very last minute, I would tell them the real deal.

251
00:16:28,274 --> 00:16:29,069
Rym: Well, what real deal?

252
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,649
Scott: That I have this many PS3s, everyone else go home.

253
00:16:32,213 --> 00:16:33,250
Rym: I'd do something crazy.

254
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,890
Rym: See, these managers, they're really not creative enough.

255
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:41,150
Rym: The most creative thing I saw is one guy made all the customers stay really far away.

256
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,930
Rym: You know, they wouldn't let him stand on the property.

257
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,210
Rym: They were standing just off the property on the sidewalk.

258
00:16:45,632 --> 00:16:48,710
Rym: And they organized themselves into a line, which, that's BS.

259
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:57,750
Rym: If I had a line and I said, "You can't line up before X time," and I saw people just making a line 100 feet away, not one of those people would be allowed into my event.

260
00:16:58,161 --> 00:16:58,310
Scott: Nope.

261
00:16:58,690 --> 00:16:59,729
Rym: But that's beside the point.

262
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:07,546
Rym: He set up 10 chairs in front of his store, then he walked over and said, "Whoever's sitting in those 10 chairs when I get back gets a

263
00:17:07,566 --> 00:17:07,607
Rym: PS3.".

264
00:17:09,893 --> 00:17:10,665
Rym: And, yeah.

265
00:17:12,034 --> 00:17:13,249
Scott: See, there's two ways that could go.

266
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:19,289
Scott: Number one, if the guy actually thought that was seriously going to be an intelligent policy, he's a dumbass.

267
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:24,969
Scott: If the guy was looking to make the most entertaining thing possible happen, he's a genius and a hero.

268
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:25,988
Rym: Well, here's the thing.

269
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:32,510
Rym: It's genius even as a line control thing, because these are all gamers who've been standing immobile for like a day already.

270
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:40,130
Rym: If the chairs are far enough away, most of them aren't going to be able to run that far fast enough for there to be a fight by the time they get to the chairs.

271
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:46,570
Scott: I think what might happen, that would be hilarious, if a fat guy was waiting in line and then filed the discrimination suit.

272
00:17:48,578 --> 00:17:48,768
Rym: Yeah.

273
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:54,630
Rym: See, what I would have done is I would have put up a cardboard picture so from the distance it looked like there were a bunch of chairs.

274
00:17:55,514 --> 00:17:55,924
Rym: Oh, man.

275
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:00,589
Rym: And then while they all ran over, I'd set up chairs back where they were originally sitting.

276
00:18:02,176 --> 00:18:02,870
Rym: That would be beautiful.

277
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,390
Rym: That would be like a beautiful ballet.

278
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:09,050
Scott: You're thinking way too much of this.

279
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,910
Scott: We should become best buy managers.

280
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,869
Rym: We should just become professional pranksters.

281
00:18:13,473 --> 00:18:14,910
Rym: We'll just go around causing trouble.

282
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:19,950
Scott: It's just hilarious that you have these groups of people all over the country making entertainment for me.

283
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:20,668
Scott: You know what?

284
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:27,970
Scott: I think these lines waiting for the PS3, just the stories about them are more entertaining than owning a PS3 ever could possibly be.

285
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,070
Rym: Well, they did give us the idea for the show tonight.

286
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:30,649
Scott: They did.

287
00:18:31,852 --> 00:18:33,949
Scott: Let's do things of the day and then talk about what our show is.

288
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,069
Rym: All right, I'll be quick because there's not much to say about this.

289
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:40,470
Rym: Guy made a robot that plays air hockey and it plays air hockey kind of like a human.

290
00:18:40,991 --> 00:18:41,829
Scott: It's kind of freaky.

291
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:45,807
Rym: It's a little startling to watch because you can tell that it's.

292
00:18:45,968 --> 00:18:53,470
Rym: obviously, the way it moves is a byproduct of the way it was coded, but at the same time, it moves a lot like a human who plays air hockey.

293
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:59,621
Scott: Well, because the only things you really need to play air hockey is an elbow and a shoulder, which is only two movement joints.

294
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,870
Rym: You're discounting the wrists.

295
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:06,470
Scott: Yeah, but this robot doesn't use wrists, which is the problem.

296
00:19:06,572 --> 00:19:07,189
Rym: I use wrists.

297
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,889
Scott: I know, that's why this robot won't beat us.

298
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:10,650
Rym: Yeah, the robot was really good, though.

299
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,990
Rym: He could defend against a six-year-old.

300
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:15,470
Scott: The robot was really good at detecting the puck and hitting it every single time.

301
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:17,969
Rym: And it was a lot more humanoid than it needed to be.

302
00:19:18,371 --> 00:19:19,649
Scott: Yeah, it was kind of cool.

303
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:31,870
Rym: I mean, I kind of expected a servo arm that just had, like, sitting over the air hockey table, and it just had the pad stuck down, the paddle, and it just moved it left and right, and all it would do is block the goal.

304
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,350
Rym: But no, it was crazy.

305
00:19:33,731 --> 00:19:34,489
Scott: Yeah, very crazy.

306
00:19:35,071 --> 00:19:36,849
Rym: And yeah, I don't know, it's not controversial.

307
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,288
Rym: I can't make a joke about it.

308
00:19:39,131 --> 00:19:45,090
Scott: All right, my thing of the day is, if you don't know, Charles Martinet is the voice actor of Mario.

309
00:19:45,512 --> 00:19:46,550
Scott: It's-a me, Mario!

310
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,810
Scott: Luigi, Waluigi, all kinds of Nintendo characters.

311
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,510
Scott: Wario, everyone.

312
00:19:52,632 --> 00:19:53,948
Rym: He's looking not so good.

313
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:57,390
Scott: He was even the voice actor, apparently, for some reader rabbit or anything.

314
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:57,706
Scott: Dude!

315
00:19:59,351 --> 00:20:04,650
Scott: What he does is, they have this thing called M-I-R-T, Mario in Real Time.

316
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:08,490
Scott: They've had this system for a long time, and they continue to use it to this day.

317
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:17,069
Scott: So what they do is, they set it up, and Charles Martinet will appear at a convention, or a promotion in a store, or something like that.

318
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:21,670
Scott: And on the TV screen, you'll see Mario's head, and maybe Mario's hands.

319
00:20:21,813 --> 00:20:22,530
Scott: I don't remember.

320
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,308
Scott: They've upgraded it.

321
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:24,349
Scott: And he talks.

322
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:27,930
Scott: He's sitting in a back room, talking into a microphone, and he has a control panel.

323
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,130
Rym: You know, Wizard of Oz style.

324
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:29,929
Scott: Exactly.

325
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:35,030
Scott: It's just like he's the frickin', you know, wizard, whatever it is, in the Wizard of Oz.

326
00:20:35,531 --> 00:20:42,749
Scott: And he's in the Emerald Palace, and he talks into a microphone somewhere behind the screen, and Mario on the screen moves around and does stuff.

327
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,710
Scott: And this is a video of that system in action.

328
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,109
Scott: Now, they've used this system.

329
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:51,350
Scott: They never actually released this system just to people, but it's appeared in many games.

330
00:20:51,511 --> 00:20:56,644
Scott: Like, if you see Mario's head talking, you know, you'll... Let's see, which ones... I don't know.

331
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:01,869
Scott: Different games have code from this system included in them to make Mario talk and move his head around.

332
00:21:02,191 --> 00:21:02,840
Scott: Like, Mario 64 and shit.

333
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:03,900
Rym: Yeah.

334
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:10,350
Scott: Anyway, this is a video of Charles Martinet using this system to do a bunch of movie impressions.

335
00:21:10,872 --> 00:21:13,930
Scott: And they're pretty hilarious, because he starts out with, like, Gone with the Wind.

336
00:21:15,652 --> 00:21:18,608
Scott: No, he starts off by saying, "Sony is

337
00:21:18,668 --> 00:21:19,010
Scott: great!"

338
00:21:19,171 --> 00:21:21,309
Scott: And then he makes Mario's nose grow really long.

339
00:21:23,132 --> 00:21:27,269
Scott: And then he does a Gone with the Wind, and he pushes a button to make a noise instead of saying bad words.

340
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,376
Rym: The only really okay one.

341
00:21:29,477 --> 00:21:52,130
Rym: to me, and I didn't like this that much, it was definitely that kind of self-referential humor that's not actually funny to me so much as it's funny because the people who are watching it are really into the thing it's about, and it's the kind of humor that, just the way it's presented and the thing it's about is a lot more important than the actual content of the humor to these people.

342
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,870
Rym: 'Cause the jokes were pretty lame.

343
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,250
Rym: You can't deny that it was kind of a lame overplayed joke.

344
00:21:57,651 --> 00:22:00,510
Scott: It's not the most funniest thing ever, but it's pretty cool.

345
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,528
Rym: Frankly, my dear, I don't give a doo-dee-doo-dee!

346
00:22:03,312 --> 00:22:03,628
Scott: Exactly.

347
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:04,377
Rym: Yeah.

348
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,989
Scott: The Star Wars one was pretty good, though.

349
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,110
Rym: The Star Wars one was pretty good.

350
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,824
Scott: 'Cause he's like, "I'm-a your

351
00:22:08,865 --> 00:22:09,288
Scott: papa.".

352
00:22:09,511 --> 00:22:10,127
Rym: "You're not-a my

353
00:22:10,147 --> 00:22:10,229
Rym: papa.".

354
00:22:11,133 --> 00:22:11,579
Scott: "I'm-a your

355
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,269
Scott: papa.".

356
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:12,843
Scott: "You're not-a my

357
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:13,090
Scott: papa.".

358
00:22:13,914 --> 00:22:14,649
Scott: It's pretty funny.

359
00:22:15,253 --> 00:22:18,809
Scott: Just watch the video, and then you'll never actually have to go and see this system.

360
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:24,309
Scott: when they're using it at the local store, and he takes a... Well, actually, you kind of do want to go see it so you can meet this dude, 'cause he's way cool.

361
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:24,643
Scott: Yeah.

362
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,068
Rym: Imagine seeing a normal human being talking like Mario.

363
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:28,430
Rym: well.

364
00:22:29,074 --> 00:22:30,069
Scott: Basically, you're seeing Mario.

365
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,589
Rym: Yeah, but you'll probably see the guy later.

366
00:22:31,814 --> 00:22:31,901
Rym: Yeah.

367
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:32,789
Rym: He'll be around.

368
00:22:33,092 --> 00:22:33,182
Rym: Yeah.

369
00:22:33,371 --> 00:22:34,070
Rym: Get his autograph.

370
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:36,290
Scott: Maybe he'll be at the Nintendo store on Sunday.

371
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:36,730
Scott: Maybe.

372
00:22:37,032 --> 00:22:37,547
Scott: I don't think so.

373
00:22:38,092 --> 00:22:38,180
Rym: Yeah.

374
00:22:38,731 --> 00:22:42,070
Rym: Well, maybe we'll talk about the last time we went to the Nintendo store.

375
00:22:42,231 --> 00:22:43,010
Scott: We probably will.

376
00:22:43,332 --> 00:22:45,870
Scott: Well, it was like three times ago, but that's not the point.

377
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:58,959
Rym: Well, the point is, because of all these PS3 things, we realized that in the course of our lives, we've stood in a lot of lines, and what better way to make a short, quick, easy-to-do Thursday episode before I go to bed

378
00:22:59,441 --> 00:23:02,809
Scott: than to talk about times we have stood in line.

379
00:23:03,912 --> 00:23:10,009
Rym: I think I've stood in more lines than Scott throughout my life just because I went to Cedar Point on a regular basis since I was two years old.

380
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:13,470
Scott: We went to a lot of freaking amusement parks and waited in lines there.

381
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:22,670
Rym: I went to Cedar Point with one exception for every year of my life from the age of two until I graduated high school for multiple days every year.

382
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,130
Scott: Actually, you want to hear a pretty good story?

383
00:23:24,532 --> 00:23:26,490
Scott: Is a time where I didn't wait in lines at all.

384
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:36,009
Scott: We went to ... I was in summer camp, and if you went to the summer camp I went to, you could choose one of the local amusement parks, and you would get to go there once on a trip on a bus.

385
00:23:37,236 --> 00:23:39,688
Scott: I chose Dorney Park because it was the one I hadn't been to.

386
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:46,149
Scott: I'd already been to Hershey Park and the nearby Six Flags or whatever, so I went to Dorney because it was new.

387
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:54,410
Scott: We went there, and it was sort of raining, so the park wasn't open yet, and basically no one was going to the park on a weekday when it was raining.

388
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:58,969
Scott: Then they finally opened the park, and there were no lines for anything, and it was pretty cool.

389
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,029
Rym: It's like Cartman and his personal amusement park.

390
00:24:01,512 --> 00:24:01,929
Scott: Pretty much.

391
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:02,909
Scott: We went to arcades.

392
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,329
Scott: No one was playing any games.

393
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:05,969
Scott: We would ride rides alone.

394
00:24:07,391 --> 00:24:12,310
Scott: The Hercules roller coaster, which I don't think exists anymore, which is actually a pretty good wooden coaster.

395
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,429
Scott: It's sad that it's gone.

396
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:18,030
Scott: We freaking just got on it, rode it, got off, got on it, rode it again.

397
00:24:18,653 --> 00:24:19,329
Scott: It was pretty great.

398
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:20,608
Scott: Good times.

399
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,590
Rym: See, it's weird how lines have kind of changed for me in my life.

400
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:30,430
Rym: When I was a kid, I had a Game Boy and a Game Gear and all those things, but I never brought them to amusement parks.

401
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:31,769
Rym: I never really brought them with me.

402
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,610
Scott: Well, you couldn't because you had to carry that shit on rides.

403
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,690
Scott: What if you went to the water park and they had to buy a locker?

404
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,669
Rym: You had to buy a locker anyway because I had a wallet and stuff.

405
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:44,150
Scott: I would use the rope with the little tube on it so I didn't have to use the locker.

406
00:24:44,811 --> 00:24:49,810
Rym: See, when I was in the park for roller coaster stuff, I didn't ride the two water rides.

407
00:24:50,833 --> 00:24:55,810
Rym: If I wanted to get wet, I went to the other park, which was a water park, and I'd put on my swimsuit.

408
00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:05,990
Scott: Yeah, I often went to parks that were either totally water parks or were combined like half and half, so the water park part was actually big enough to justify what I do.

409
00:25:06,512 --> 00:25:10,750
Rym: Yeah, it was basically a separate park that cost a lot of money to get into separately from Cedar Point.

410
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:11,810
Scott: Yeah, anyway.

411
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:23,190
Rym: Yeah, but when I was a kid, I remember standing in line with my family for roller coasters, and especially if it was a really popular roller coaster on a really bad day, you could wait two hours in line in the heat.

412
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:33,710
Rym: What I remember is that no one ever brought any form of entertainment whatsoever, and most people stood completely silent, looking miserable.

413
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:39,169
Scott: Well, I think that's part of what Disney actually does right, and Universal also to some extent.

414
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:47,290
Scott: Basically all the Orlando, Florida parks is that the lines themselves have some sort of distracting animatronic entertainment.

415
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:53,130
Rym: Yeah, that's funny for about a second, and then you've already seen everything Mickey Mouse has to say, and now you're still in line.

416
00:25:53,312 --> 00:25:53,528
Scott: I know.

417
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:56,989
Scott: The one I remember the most was the Terminator 2 3D movie.

418
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:57,520
Scott: Yeah!

419
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:00,587
Scott: Because when you were in the waiting room, there was that video going on.

420
00:26:00,627 --> 00:26:03,390
Scott: that was the prequel to the ride, and that was pretty cool.

421
00:26:03,651 --> 00:26:10,869
Rym: Not only that, but they had this ... When I was a little kid when I saw this, and for a second it was so awesome because I'm in line, right?

422
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:17,370
Rym: Like a security thing happened, because there's these cameras all around, and you see TVs with monitors in the line.

423
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:33,589
Rym: There's the main prequel movie, but there's also TV monitors that show what you think is the line, and then you'll hear an alarm, and you look up at the TV, and you see these guards rushing up and grabbing some guy out of the line and pulling him away, and there's a fight and robots and stuff.

424
00:26:34,451 --> 00:26:43,870
Rym: My little kid, mine, it took a while to realize that that was obviously some prerecorded movie that they play every hour, but when I was a kid, that was awesome.

425
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:44,949
Scott: Very awesome.

426
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:50,309
Rym: Of course, then there were ... Sometimes that whole idea of making the line entertaining falls on its face.

427
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:58,109
Rym: Cedar Point had this old ride called Avalanche Run, and one year, because they had a policy at least they used to, of making a rollercoaster every year.

428
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:05,188
Rym: They took this old ride Avalanche Run, enclosed it, and basically turned it into a Space Mountain-like ride instead.

429
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:05,990
Rym: All right.

430
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:07,109
Rym: But it was the same rollercoaster.

431
00:27:07,551 --> 00:27:11,012
Rym: It just seemed a lot better because it was enclosed, so you didn't realize how slow it actually was,

432
00:27:12,015 --> 00:27:12,497
Scott: and they had this

433
00:27:12,618 --> 00:27:23,730
Rym: crazy animatronic thing, like five different rooms for the line with all this cool stuff everywhere and these robots yelling at you and little shipping containers flying all around, and it was awesome.

434
00:27:24,591 --> 00:27:35,910
Rym: They, as far as I can tell, never once sent a single maintenance person into that building because every year it got a little bit more dilapidated and a little bit more dilapidated.

435
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:44,650
Rym: Like one year the robot didn't talk anymore, but it still kind of moved, but in this kind of creepy half-ass death twitch- That's something that always bothered me.

436
00:27:46,174 --> 00:27:52,268
Scott: As I was a little kid, animatronic stuff seemed to work really, really well wherever I went, and there was a lot of it.

437
00:27:52,731 --> 00:27:58,690
Scott: And over time, animatronic stuff seemed to work less well, and it didn't seem like anyone was fixing it anywhere.

438
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:02,030
Scott: Like Stu Leonard's used to have animatronic shit all over the place.

439
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:07,070
Scott: Now they've really, really reduced it down to a few really, really simple things.

440
00:28:09,051 --> 00:28:13,490
Scott: And freaking Disney stores used to have all that animatronic shit everywhere.

441
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:15,010
Scott: Now they don't have it so much anymore.

442
00:28:15,851 --> 00:28:21,089
Scott: It was everywhere, and then it didn't work, no one repaired it, and they stopped putting up new stuff.

443
00:28:21,392 --> 00:28:23,690
Rym: Because it was probably really expensive to keep that stuff working.

444
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:27,150
Scott: I know, and nowadays you hardly ever see new animatronic shit anywhere.

445
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:30,667
Rym: The kicker was eventually this building, because that was the rollercoaster.

446
00:28:30,688 --> 00:28:33,588
Rym: everyone tried to ride when it was raining, because it was in a building so you could just ride it.

447
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:39,145
Rym: Eventually one year, I remember I went in, because the other reason you'd go there is that the building was air-conditioned.

448
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:49,030
Rym: So when it's 95 degrees and it's 4 o'clock, and you just stood in line for two hours to ride the Raptor, and you need to cool off, you go ride that ride, disaster transport.

449
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:57,363
Rym: One year I go in there, and it's really warm, and the air-conditioning's not working, and I just walked out of the line, I was like, "Fuck

450
00:28:57,403 --> 00:28:57,644
Rym: this!".

451
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:08,290
Scott: Before Six Flags New England was Six Flags New England, it was still called Riverside, what they would do is they would air-condition all the gift shops and nothing else.

452
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:14,530
Scott: It was the most genius move that I recognized, even as a middle school kid, what the hell they were doing.

453
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:18,049
Scott: So we hung out in this gift shop, and we didn't move for like 10 minutes.

454
00:29:18,772 --> 00:29:19,889
Scott: We didn't buy anything either.

455
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,189
Scott: It was a good move.

456
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:42,390
Rym: See, my trick when I wanted to cool off at a park like that, once I was older and wiser and I wasn't with my family anymore, I'd totally just leave the park and go over to the Breakers Hotel next door, which is an old, awesome, historic hotel, and go to the fancy upper balcony that looks out over the lake, and sit down in a restaurant or in one of the bars or something, and enjoy the air-conditioning and have a soda.

457
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:46,290
Scott: Yeah, that's what we did, we got milkshakes and then we went into the gift shop.

458
00:29:47,811 --> 00:29:55,290
Rym: Of course, also in the gift shop, as a young kid, I would always often buy one of those two AA battery fans that you hold in front of your face.

459
00:29:55,491 --> 00:29:56,029
Scott: Those are good.

460
00:29:56,390 --> 00:30:02,750
Rym: And then they last about 10 minutes because not only are they inefficient, but it's 95 degrees anyway and the batteries overheat.

461
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:06,830
Scott: So what other fun times have we had in line?

462
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:16,570
Rym: Well, we actually got in line a while ago, actually a long time ago, to see Miyamoto at the Nintendo store, and we made a tactical error.

463
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:20,410
Rym: This experience actually changed our lives in a small way.

464
00:30:20,591 --> 00:30:21,490
Scott: In a very small way.

465
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:25,544
Scott: It changed our policy about line waiting, because line waiting has changed over the years.

466
00:30:26,571 --> 00:30:34,070
Scott: It used to be that you would wait in a line, and if you knew what the line was for, you were going to get whatever you were waiting for, it was just a matter of time.

467
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,389
Scott: Nowadays, this is not true.

468
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:35,819
Rym: Yep.

469
00:30:36,371 --> 00:30:39,970
Rym: There's also the fact that when I was a kid, I had infinite free time and I didn't care.

470
00:30:40,292 --> 00:30:43,970
Rym: If I wanted something, I would get in line at any point in my life and it didn't matter.

471
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:51,030
Rym: Now, you know, I have a job, I have a podcast, I have friends, I do things, I need sleep.

472
00:30:51,630 --> 00:31:03,129
Rym: So when we heard that Miyamoto was going to be at the Nintendo store signing autographs and I could get my Zelda 2 gold cartridge, because I like it more than Zelda 1, signed by him, I was all about that and Scott was all about that.

473
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:08,509
Rym: And we thought, "Hey, why don't we go now, tonight, and get in line and stay all

474
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:08,830
Rym: night?".

475
00:31:09,191 --> 00:31:19,528
Rym: And we convinced ourselves not to, because it would be a waste of time, we need our sleep, it would suck, we'll just take the 5 AM train, get there at 6, the event was at 1, we'll be fine.

476
00:31:20,772 --> 00:31:21,870
Rym: That was a mistake.

477
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:25,909
Rym: We got there, what, at like 6.30 in the morning?

478
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,160
Rym: There were already like 150 people lined up.

479
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:31,170
Scott: Yeah, it was too late, we were done.

480
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:38,748
Rym: The worst thing is, the number of people that got autographs from Miyamoto ended a stone's throw from us.

481
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:52,450
Scott: Not only that, but when we got there, the line was pretty short in front of us, but people who were friends of the people in front of us were like joining up with them in there, It's like, the people managing the line did not do anything to prevent the cutting.

482
00:31:53,070 --> 00:32:07,370
Scott: It's like, if you have a line of limited people, it's really not fair, like, I'm all for torturing people out in the line, as we were talking about before, but at the same time, when it's a serious line and the serious stuff going on.

483
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:09,010
Rym: Yeah, it's so serious to meet Miyamoto.

484
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:18,708
Scott: I know, but you have to kind of, you know, make people not feel like they're wasting their time and effort, you know, and frickin' treat them like human beings, be like,

485
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:18,929
Scott: "Hey.".

486
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:19,648
Rym: Well, you know what?

487
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:20,548
Rym: They did, though.

488
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:31,430
Rym: Nintendo not only brought out pizza and water for free for everyone in line, and bear in mind that there were thousands of people by the end of this.

489
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:35,730
Rym: This turned into a far larger event than Nintendo expected.

490
00:32:35,941 --> 00:32:36,110
Rym: Yeah.

491
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:38,950
Scott: I mean, they did an okay job, but they didn't do a perfect job.

492
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:42,290
Rym: They brought free pizza, and then they brought free pizza again.

493
00:32:44,019 --> 00:32:44,190
Rym: Awesome.

494
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:56,490
Rym: That was fantastic, but other than that, we stood in line with all these punk kids, because the section of the line we were in happened to be punk kid land, and it was fun hanging out with punk kids, but at the same time, I remember why I hate punk kids.

495
00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:00,190
Scott: Yeah, there was one punk kid who was smarter than all the other punk kids, and we talked to him a lot.

496
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:02,209
Rym: Yeah, but the rest of them were just spastic.

497
00:33:02,692 --> 00:33:08,529
Rym: I couldn't understand what they would try to say to me, because in the middle of a sentence, they'd be on a new topic already.

498
00:33:09,671 --> 00:33:14,909
Scott: We played a lot of DS games with everybody, as you are wont to do in a line outside of the Nintendo store.

499
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:18,450
Rym: Well, in general, when I was a kid, this is the thing I was going to get to way before.

500
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:28,330
Rym: Everyone would just stand in line kind of quiet, or maybe people would talk in small groups, and now, if I stand in any line, anywhere, I have my DS- Except at the water park.

501
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:32,070
Rym: Or a manga or something, and if I'm at a water park, I don't go alone.

502
00:33:32,432 --> 00:33:34,570
Rym: I stand in line with all my friends, and we're loud.

503
00:33:35,172 --> 00:33:35,949
Rym: Real loud.

504
00:33:37,673 --> 00:33:39,349
Scott: What are the good lines that we stood in?

505
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:43,230
Scott: A lot of Otakon pre-reg lines, but those are all technically the same.

506
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:45,569
Rym: You stood in a lot of Otakon pre-reg lines.

507
00:33:46,151 --> 00:33:47,209
Scott: You've stood in quite a few.

508
00:33:47,471 --> 00:33:47,969
Rym: Not as many.

509
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:57,270
Rym: The thing is, Otakon took away the one privilege the panelists and associates used to get, where we could pick up our badges from someone else, and we didn't have to stand in line.

510
00:33:57,691 --> 00:33:59,609
Scott: The lines actually move really quickly now.

511
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:06,750
Scott: You don't have to wait in the heat so long, but there are less podcasters, cosplayers out in line than there used to be.

512
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,337
Rym: I think that was just because it was 100,000 degrees this year.

513
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:16,409
Scott: Basically, we've learned to turn that line from a boring wait into an awesome party.

514
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,429
Rym: Well, let me put it this way.

515
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:26,987
Rym: That line is easily avoidable if you're not stupid, and it amazes me that people will stand in the line to get into Otakon for the Thursday pre-reg for more than 20 minutes.

516
00:34:28,154 --> 00:34:29,449
Rym: They line up hours before.

517
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:41,188
Rym: They stand there for hours complaining about the heat, and it's miserable, when if they just wait until, I don't know, 20 minutes after the line starts moving, the line moves so fast that you'll be in and out before you know it.

518
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:45,547
Scott: Yeah, I mean, we got in the line at, like, I think we said nine, and we... Was it nine?

519
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:46,630
Rym: No, it wasn't nine.

520
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,949
Rym: We waited until exactly an hour and a half after the line opened.

521
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,370
Scott: Yeah, I think it was like 6.30.

522
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:54,330
Scott: We just got in the line, and 20 minutes later, we had our badges.

523
00:34:54,656 --> 00:34:54,742
Rym: Yeah.

524
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:56,330
Rym: I don't know what these people were thinking.

525
00:34:56,753 --> 00:34:59,130
Scott: They could have been doing something else besides sitting outside in the heat.

526
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,950
Rym: Yeah, and it wasn't like a normal fun line where everyone's really yelling and having a good time.

527
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:04,863
Rym: It was people just miserable going,

528
00:35:04,883 --> 00:35:04,924
Rym: "Oh.".

529
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:14,540
Scott: Yeah, that's another thing is we've learned to take lines and turn them into fun parties as opposed to just being boring waiting in line.

530
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:24,820
Scott: I mean, I think that's part of the reason why a lot of people are lining up more and more for pre-orders and pre-regs and things is because even if they don't... I mean, there are people standing in line.

531
00:35:25,101 --> 00:35:32,179
Scott: They know a store is going to get like 10 PS3s, and they're like the 30th guy in line, and they're sitting out there anyway, and I think that's because lines have become fun.

532
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:40,020
Scott: They're like this cultural event where even if you're not going to get whatever you're waiting in line for, there's still a chance.

533
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:45,140
Scott: You still have a little bit of hope, even if you know you don't secretly deep inside.

534
00:35:45,385 --> 00:35:45,678
Scott: Yeah.

535
00:35:45,981 --> 00:35:47,219
Scott: But you're standing out there.

536
00:35:47,641 --> 00:35:54,020
Scott: You're with a bunch of like-minded people and all your comrades, and it's like a little party.

537
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:54,505
Rym: Yeah.

538
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,700
Rym: Granted, I don't really get into lines for events like that, and I never really have.

539
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,980
Rym: The Miyamoto thing was pretty much the only one.

540
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:01,269
Rym: Yeah.

541
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:01,940
Scott: Yeah.

542
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,800
Rym: Because I have better things to do, and also like the video game consoles.

543
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:09,020
Rym: One, I haven't bought one since the DS, and I didn't have to wait in line for that.

544
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:20,880
Scott: Yeah, I don't think I have to wait in line for my Wii either because I pre-ordered it at the Nintendo store, which didn't have a wait in line, and I'm supposedly guaranteed to get one on Sunday, so I probably won't have to wait in line then either.

545
00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:21,439
Scott: Yeah.

546
00:36:21,661 --> 00:36:25,919
Scott: I imagine I'll just walk in, maybe I'll wait in a little bit of a line because it'll be crowded.

547
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:30,072
Scott: I'll just have to wait for the crowd in front of me to get their Wiis, and then I'll get one.

548
00:36:30,741 --> 00:36:32,838
Scott: It's not going to be a line of, "Am I going to get

549
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:33,040
Scott: one?".

550
00:36:33,081 --> 00:36:34,579
Scott: It's a line of, "Here's your Wii.

551
00:36:35,023 --> 00:36:35,518
Scott: Here's your Wii.

552
00:36:35,921 --> 00:36:36,437
Scott: Here's your Wii.

553
00:36:36,682 --> 00:36:37,480
Scott: What games do you want?

554
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,057
Scott: Here's your Wii.

555
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,220
Rym: See, most of the lines I've stood in were really just amusement park lines.

556
00:36:42,903 --> 00:36:44,560
Rym: I used to practically grow up at Cedar Point.

557
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,820
Rym: I'd go there so many times.

558
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:53,398
Rym: I used to skip high school when I was a senior on a semi-regular basis and just be like, "Hey, guys, you want to go to Cedar Point instead of going to

559
00:36:53,438 --> 00:36:53,640
Rym: school?".

560
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,780
Rym: Then we'd all go to Cedar Point because it's like a two-hour drive away.

561
00:36:57,761 --> 00:37:01,620
Rym: If you have a year of ... It's like one day of Cedar Point, 50 bucks.

562
00:37:02,602 --> 00:37:03,974
Rym: A season pass, 100 bucks.

563
00:37:05,846 --> 00:37:06,337
Rym: There you go.

564
00:37:07,421 --> 00:37:09,060
Scott: I think most amusement parks have that.

565
00:37:10,121 --> 00:37:15,740
Scott: If you go there more than two times in a season, the season pass ends up being a better deal.

566
00:37:16,842 --> 00:37:25,840
Scott: They trick a lot of people who only go there once or twice into getting the season pass, and those people don't actually come back often enough to make the season pass unprofitable.

567
00:37:26,121 --> 00:37:27,920
Rym: Even if they do, the locals will come back.

568
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:34,819
Rym: The real way they make their money is the fact that a Coke is $4.50 and it's nine bucks to get a burger and fries.

569
00:37:35,647 --> 00:37:36,260
Scott: Yep, yep, yep.

570
00:37:36,961 --> 00:37:49,698
Rym: God, I remember when I was in high school, and one day we noticed that the vending machines all around Cedar Point only took dollar bills, and everything from a vending machine was three bucks.

571
00:37:50,603 --> 00:37:50,877
Scott: Wow.

572
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,179
Rym: Three bucks.

573
00:37:53,163 --> 00:37:53,377
Rym: Yeah.

574
00:37:54,241 --> 00:37:54,537
Scott: Wow.

575
00:37:55,180 --> 00:38:07,700
Rym: Yeah, and I remember there was an art to waiting in line at amusement parks, because a lot of parks have different tricks, but usually when an amusement park closes, they have some kind of policy like how they cut off the end of the line at the end of the night.

576
00:38:08,301 --> 00:38:11,192
Rym: I remember that Cedar Point, the way they did it was at 11

577
00:38:11,192 --> 00:38:11,694
Rym: p.m.,

578
00:38:12,076 --> 00:38:17,205
Rym: D-Day, the end of the line, the last moment, they would just go to the end of the line and say, "No one else gets in

579
00:38:17,246 --> 00:38:17,510
Rym: line.".

580
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:34,201
Rym: So what the cool thing to do, and we did this all the time, is we'd get all our friends together, we'd hang out, we'd go grab a whole bunch of food that we could carry, like chicken fingers or something, and we'd run and we'd get in line for the baddest ass rollercoaster whatever was up that year at 10.59.

581
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:46,600
Rym: We'd try to be the absolute last people in line with all this food, and it'd be like a three hour crazy party, they'd be playing music, people would often buy the food off of us because they didn't plan ahead and they were hungry.

582
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:53,419
Rym: Then we realized that we didn't have enough drinks, and now we're thirsty, or we had too many drinks and now we have to pee.

583
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:57,200
Scott: I think they count on that, hoping that people will leave the line.

584
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,500
Rym: Oh goddamn, we didn't.

585
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:03,940
Rym: If we weren't last in line, we'd let people cut ahead, because it was the coolest thing to ride a rollercoaster.

586
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,180
Rym: You're pretty much the only ones on the train because it's the last ride of the night.

587
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:12,160
Rym: Maybe there's one employee sitting in the back, and then you walk out of the amusement park and it's completely empty.

588
00:39:13,222 --> 00:39:16,600
Rym: As a kid, I always wanted to just stay there, just don't leave.

589
00:39:17,721 --> 00:39:46,720
Scott: Actually, I remember another time when my family went to Universal or whatever, we actually got there when the park opened in the morning, and you kind of had to stand there and wait for the park to open before it opens, and then when they open it, this employee guy basically opens the thing and lets you all come through, and then he runs down the street in the park, and as he runs down the street, they open all the different rides as he passes by them, and then you have all these people running after him to try to get to the ride.

590
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,500
Scott: that's going to be super crowded later in the day.

591
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,500
Rym: God, I remember that at Cedar Point so often in my life.

592
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,580
Rym: We never got to Cedar Point after it opened.

593
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,420
Rym: We'd always get there an hour before it opened and stand in the line to get into the line.

594
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,000
Scott: I wouldn't wait an hour before it opened.

595
00:39:59,163 --> 00:39:59,656
Rym: You had to.

596
00:40:00,021 --> 00:40:00,959
Scott: I wouldn't wait a half hour.

597
00:40:01,721 --> 00:40:08,020
Rym: The gate would open, and they'd open the three different gates at the same time, and it would be a mad freaking rush.

598
00:40:08,201 --> 00:40:13,440
Rym: People would just be running at top speed, and no matter how fast I ran, there was always.

599
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,260
Scott: See, that's the thing.

600
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:18,580
Scott: It's like they run to get to the first ride, but you don't see them running from ride to ride.

601
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,459
Scott: Very few people are smart enough to do that.

602
00:40:21,662 --> 00:40:24,220
Scott: It's like once they've ridden one ride, now they walk from ride to ride.

603
00:40:24,262 --> 00:40:24,617
Rym: I didn't.

604
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:30,000
Rym: I remember we had a policy, just like the front row crew, a policy of drop anyone who sucks and leave them behind.

605
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:34,698
Rym: I'd usually go to Cedar Point with people, and a lot of times people who I didn't go with often would go.

606
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:40,934
Rym: There'd be me and the four friends who know my policy on Cedar Point and are right there with me.

607
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,140
Rym: Then there'd be all the people who were like, "Hey, I want to hang out with Rym.

608
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,011
Rym: We'll just ...

609
00:40:45,011 --> 00:40:45,093
Rym: ah.".

610
00:40:45,962 --> 00:40:49,040
Rym: They'd learn real quick that Cedar Point was all business.

611
00:40:49,442 --> 00:40:49,960
Scott: That's right.

612
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,837
Rym: When we got out of line, it was like, "We are going to this ride now.

613
00:40:53,746 --> 00:40:53,852
Rym: Go.

614
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:54,687
Rym: Run.".

615
00:40:55,163 --> 00:40:56,320
Rym: People would get left behind.

616
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,699
Rym: People would be like, "This sucks," and leave.

617
00:40:58,341 --> 00:41:00,579
Rym: Every now and then, they'd be the new cool person and be like, "Wow.

618
00:41:01,162 --> 00:41:05,196
Rym: I rode four times more rides than I've ever ridden in a day by hanging out with you

619
00:41:05,236 --> 00:41:05,598
Rym: guys.".

620
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,380
Scott: Amusement parks, I was totally all business.

621
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:20,360
Scott: I'm so sad they closed Action Park, but I'm glad I got to go to it once or twice, because that park, there were so many water slides, and you had to carry a tube around with you for half the slides, so it was pretty much, "Go down a slide.

622
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:20,959
Scott: Grab the tube.

623
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:21,760
Scott: Go run up the stairs.

624
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,259
Scott: Run up the stairs.

625
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:23,240
Scott: Go down the slide.

626
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:23,840
Scott: Grab the tube.

627
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,360
Scott: Run up the stairs.

628
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,172
Scott: Run up the

629
00:41:25,193 --> 00:41:25,340
Scott: stairs.".

630
00:41:25,647 --> 00:41:26,180
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

631
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,820
Rym: I got such a burning desire to go to a water park.

632
00:41:28,942 --> 00:41:29,840
Rym: I haven't been on a water slide.

633
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,412
Scott: My burning desire for water park is years old.

634
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:35,000
Scott: It's been like ... It's like this festering infection.

635
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,380
Rym: I can't remember.

636
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:41,100
Rym: I think it was in high school, was the last time that I was on a water slide.

637
00:41:41,962 --> 00:41:42,658
Rym: That's not cool.

638
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:43,344
Rym: Wow.

639
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:44,224
Rym: Why?

640
00:41:45,246 --> 00:41:45,677
Scott: No, no, no.

641
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,840
Scott: I went on a water slide between freshman and sophomore year.

642
00:41:49,224 --> 00:41:49,838
Rym: I did not.

643
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:50,872
Scott: Ha ha.

644
00:41:51,641 --> 00:41:52,960
Rym: Wait, I might have gone to Cedar Point.

645
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:54,680
Rym: I might have gone to Cedar Point.

646
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,020
Scott: But did you go on a water slide, though?

647
00:41:56,122 --> 00:41:56,938
Rym: I don't know.

648
00:41:57,401 --> 00:41:57,938
Scott: Dun, dun, dun.

649
00:41:58,122 --> 00:41:59,058
Rym: I don't think I did.

650
00:41:59,361 --> 00:41:59,718
Scott: Dun, dun, dun.

651
00:42:00,122 --> 00:42:01,300
Rym: Ah, I need a water slide.

652
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,220
Scott: We need a water slide.

653
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:02,778
Scott: You know what?

654
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,565
Scott: We should get one of those big-ass boats that has a water slide that goes right into the sea.

655
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,660
Rym: Next summer, we're going to a water park no matter what.

656
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:10,520
Rym: We'll fly out to Texas.

657
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,639
Scott: Let's go to a water park right now.

658
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,900
Rym: Go to the ... There's no water parks to go to.

659
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,699
Scott: There's one right there.

660
00:42:15,301 --> 00:42:18,849
Rym: Yeah, if we break in ... It's been raining, so ...

661
00:42:18,849 --> 00:42:19,057
Scott: Yeah.

662
00:42:19,722 --> 00:42:20,479
Rym: That's a great idea.

663
00:42:20,722 --> 00:42:20,978
Scott: It is.

664
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,560
Rym: So yeah, there's not much else we can really say.

665
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,060
Rym: We didn't plan this episode out.

666
00:42:25,181 --> 00:42:28,900
Scott: No, I figured there'd be a bunch of stories about lines, but most of them aren't too exciting.

667
00:42:29,121 --> 00:42:31,700
Scott: The GameCube line that I waded in, not too exciting.

668
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:35,300
Rym: Yeah, well, it was two people, and I dropped you off at the media play at six in the morning.

669
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:39,556
Scott: And then a bunch of other people showed up behind us, and we all got GameCubes, and it was a happy time.

670
00:42:39,721 --> 00:42:40,239
Rym: Well, behind you.

671
00:42:40,501 --> 00:42:42,340
Rym: I slept in my car in my pajamas.

672
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:42,976
Rym: Yeah?

673
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,319
Rym: I didn't even get out of the car.

674
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,960
Scott: But you didn't get a GameCube, so you didn't need to wait in line.

675
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:47,999
Rym: Because I didn't need a GameCube.

676
00:42:48,563 --> 00:42:49,360
Rym: You got a GameCube.

677
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,960
Rym: Effectively, I got a GameCube.

678
00:42:52,262 --> 00:42:56,140
Rym: I went and dutifully bought one controller, which I use to this day.

679
00:42:57,201 --> 00:43:02,663
Rym: I'm going to go out and buy, sometime this week probably, or next week, a Wiimote for me.

680
00:43:03,101 --> 00:43:03,699
Scott: That's a good idea.

681
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,597
Rym: Probably a green one.

682
00:43:05,661 --> 00:43:06,900
Scott: I don't think they have different colors.

683
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:10,120
Scott: I think you have to buy these plastic things you put on the Wiimote.

684
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:10,960
Rym: That's even better.

685
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:11,673
Rym: Yeah.

686
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,059
Rym: Because then someone will make some awesome custom ones.

687
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,952
Scott: I'm going to buy a three-pack, I think, of the things that cover the Wiimotes.

688
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:22,640
Rym: All I got to say to all of our friends out there, you're on your own for Wiimotes.

689
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:23,307
Scott: Yeah.

690
00:43:23,661 --> 00:43:25,219
Rym: I'm not buying one for any of you.

691
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:30,660
Scott: I'm buying one extra one, just because there's bound to be a game that requires the use of two Wiimotes.

692
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,020
Rym: Yeah.

693
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,940
Rym: I just assume that everyone I know will own their own Wiimote.

694
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,140
Rym: You'll bring it in a case.

695
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,600
Rym: It'll be like your prize golf club.

696
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,558
Rym: You bring it out before the game, like shh.

697
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:39,176
Scott: Yeah.

698
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:43,957
Scott: Plus, your Wiimote stores things like your Mii, supposedly, so you're going to want to have your own.

699
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:44,613
Rym: Yeah.

700
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,579
Rym: We'll see how that all works.

701
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:50,313
Scott: Yeah, I got to figure out exactly how that works, because most of it's just rumors and hearsay.

702
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:51,639
Scott: We'll know on Sunday.

703
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:52,200
Rym: Yep.

704
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:56,420
Rym: So I guess this is the end of Throwaway Thursday, standing in line.

705
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:57,839
Scott: Throwaway Thursday.

706
00:43:58,181 --> 00:44:01,579
Rym: Stay tuned for next week, when we'll talk about the Wii.

707
00:44:02,364 --> 00:44:03,079
Scott: Next week.

708
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:04,366
Rym: Wii.

709
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:04,627
Rym: Yeah.

710
00:44:05,141 --> 00:44:13,191
Rym: So much for Resident Evil 4.

711
00:44:13,191 --> 00:44:15,270
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

712
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:17,870
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

713
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:29,810
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontroadcrew.com, where you'll find show notes, links, our awesome forum, a link to our Frapper map, and links to all the RSS feeds.

714
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:35,988
Rym: We say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week, covering four different brands of geekery.

715
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:38,129
Rym: Mondays are science and technology.

716
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:40,670
Rym: Tuesdays we have video games, board games, and RPGs.

717
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:46,629
Rym: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights, and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

718
00:44:47,131 --> 00:44:55,190
Scott: You can send us feedback by email to geeknights@frontroadcrew.com, or you can send audio feedback via Odeo.

719
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:58,770
Scott: Just click the link that says "send me an Odeo" on the right side of our website.

720
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:04,249
Rym: If you like what you hear, you can catch the last 100 episodes in iTunes or in your favorite podcatcher.

721
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:07,590
Rym: For the complete archives, visit the website, which has everything.

724
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:25,030
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

725
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:28,590
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
