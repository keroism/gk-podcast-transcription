1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,488
Scott: It's Tuesday, August 1st, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:12,909 --> 00:00:16,759
Scott: Tonight, we discuss the video game Super Mario Strikers.

3
00:00:19,222 --> 00:00:20,238
Rym: Let's do this!

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,311
Scott: Today is Tuesday, which means tomorrow is Wednesday.

5
00:00:24,392 --> 00:00:26,420
Scott: In fact, you're probably listening to this on Wednesday.

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,280
Scott: Thursday, we're going to Otakon.

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:30,679
Rym: Otakon hoooo!

8
00:00:32,342 --> 00:00:34,600
Scott: Watch as my sword grows larger.

9
00:00:35,443 --> 00:00:43,320
Rym: Now, because we're going to Otakon, one, next week we're going to have nothing but GeekNights specials, as opposed to normal GeekNights episodes.

10
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,900
Scott: Because they're recorded in advance, and, uh, yeah.

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:53,359
Rym: Two, tomorrow is the last show for this week, because Thursday, we will be @Otakon.

12
00:00:54,461 --> 00:00:58,700
Scott: And, you know, it's not fun to record a show while you're at a con.

13
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,760
Rym: Let alone pay for the privilege of uploading a show.

14
00:01:02,042 --> 00:01:04,699
Scott: Actually, I think there's free wireless in the BCC, but...

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,480
Rym: But we can't go into the BCC Thursday.

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,400
Scott: I think it's all the whole Inner Harbor area, but it's just, it's too much effort.

17
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,719
Scott: Screw you guys.

18
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,060
Rym: Yeah, we may upload little things or post in the forum, but you're not getting much from us.

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,790
Scott: Nope, not much at all.

20
00:01:18,052 --> 00:01:18,274
Scott: Maybe...

21
00:01:18,838 --> 00:01:19,040
Rym: yeah.

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,970
Rym: Now also, Wednesday is not going to be a normal episode.

23
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:24,380
Rym: It is going to be the Otakon pregame.

24
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:38,039
Rym: So, if you're coming to Otakon, and you are curious as to how, when, where, and why you can or would want to be able to see us, that will be the best idea of where we're going to be and when, and what we'll be doing at the con.

25
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:46,860
Scott: In addition to some other things, like things you might want to check out at the con, and all kinds of other, you know, this year specific con info and tips from us.

26
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,520
Scott: But if you're not going to Otakon, don't even bother listening tomorrow.

27
00:01:51,241 --> 00:01:53,820
Rym: No, listen anyway, because you should care about Otakon a lot.

28
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:57,035
Scott: If you're in the Northeast U.S.

29
00:01:57,095 --> 00:01:57,900
Scott: and you're a geek, yes.

30
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,080
Rym: If you live East of the Mississippi, and you are in any way a geek...

31
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,000
Scott: Well, well, North of the... well, I guess no, the Mason-Dixon is real close to Otakon, so...

32
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,600
Rym: Yeah, people from the South go to Otakon.

33
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,559
Scott: Carolina and North should care.

34
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:17,239
Rym: The one thing about Otakon is that very definitely there is a lot more traffic clogging up I-95 North than I-95 South after the con.

35
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,669
Scott: Yeah, that is true.

36
00:02:18,952 --> 00:02:19,660
Scott: That is very true.

37
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,706
Rym: But anyway, it is gaming day.

38
00:02:21,887 --> 00:02:25,818
Rym: We've got a lot to say about Super Mario Strikers, but we'll get to that.

39
00:02:27,201 --> 00:02:34,780
Scott: Right now, we have... was probably the hottest news this week, and we know we're recording this on Sunday, right?

40
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:47,500
Rym: Yes, right now the press date is Sunday, July 30th at 956 PM, therefore, if there are any breaking developments after that time, we will not have that information tonight.

41
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,042
Scott: Well, here's the thing.

42
00:02:48,062 --> 00:02:59,446
Scott: There's a news story about E3, and the final word about this news story is going to be on Monday, which is tomorrow, which is after we're recording this, and before you're listening to it.

43
00:02:59,928 --> 00:03:04,400
Scott: So you're going to know the full story, but we can't talk about that because we don't know it yet.

44
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,900
Rym: So we're not going to talk a lot about the details of what's going on, and we're going to talk a lot more about what we think the ramifications will be.

45
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,793
Scott: Yes, now, the story is...

46
00:03:13,183 --> 00:03:15,454
Rym: The story was that E3 is cancelled.

47
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:16,780
Scott: Way to go, Dave.

48
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:24,946
Scott: There was one website that decided, I think, next-gen, and they wanted to bring a lot of traffic to their site and be all,

49
00:03:25,006 --> 00:03:25,428
Scott: "Oooh!"

50
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:26,352
Scott: with a hot story.

51
00:03:26,734 --> 00:03:29,380
Scott: So they put up a news story that said E3 is cancelled.

52
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,046
Scott: Ars Technica is reporting that.

53
00:03:32,187 --> 00:03:32,789
Scott: that's bullshit.

54
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:41,540
Scott: Now, E3 is run by the Entertainment Software Association, which is sort of like the RIAA for video games, or the MPAA for video games.

55
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,427
Scott: And they run E3 as part of what they do.

56
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:54,299
Scott: And E3 isn't really useful anymore, as useful, for a variety of reasons.

57
00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:07,640
Rym: Yeah, I mean, we've talked about it before, but basically, E3 is... All the people who want to go to E3 and who do go to E3 now, they want it to be a convention where they can hang out and play video games and learn about video games and have a good time.

58
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,320
Scott: And play the newest video games before everyone else because it's so cool and awesome.

59
00:04:11,742 --> 00:04:16,499
Rym: Also, especially not so much now, because now every dick in the world can go to E3.

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,291
Rym: It's not hard to get into E3.

61
00:04:19,915 --> 00:04:21,019
Rym: But it used to be a lot more difficult.

62
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,928
Scott: I mean, it's technically very difficult.

63
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:24,817
Scott: You have to actually be in the industry.

64
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:26,980
Scott: The problem is that it really isn't difficult.

65
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,838
Rym: And like two, three, four years ago, people who went to E3, it was like, "I went to

66
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:31,938
Rym: E3."

67
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,350
Rym: And people would go, "What?

68
00:04:33,553 --> 00:04:34,200
Rym: Wow.".

69
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,332
Scott: Well, because E3 is supposed to be a trade show.

70
00:04:37,413 --> 00:04:44,519
Scott: A trade show is when a bunch of companies in the same industry all set up booths in a big room and network with each other and do business.

71
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,480
Rym: Simultaneously, usually.

72
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,160
Scott: And they show off the latest products to the press.

73
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:54,820
Rym: Yes, the press are the biggest key there because the press will see everything and write press releases on it and news articles about it.

74
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,780
Scott: Well, not press releases.

75
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,640
Rym: Well, they will watch the press releases and then report on them.

76
00:04:58,743 --> 00:04:58,958
Rym: Yes.

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,660
Rym: And then they will write press articles about them.

78
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,392
Scott: And this wasn't easy to do back in the day.

79
00:05:03,452 --> 00:05:06,719
Scott: If you had a new product back in the day, how could you show it off?

80
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,819
Scott: You couldn't just make a website for it.

81
00:05:09,381 --> 00:05:18,219
Scott: You either had to hold an event and get people to come to your company to show them this new amazing product and have a press conference, which is a pain in the ass.

82
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:24,220
Scott: Or you could just go to a trade show and save all your new products for the trade show.

83
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,780
Scott: And then all the press would see your new product and you don't have to hold a press conference at your company.

84
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:37,006
Rym: Now, because E3 has gotten bigger and bigger, it has become filled with people like me and Scott, who generally are just in the way of this industry trying to do what it wants to do.

85
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:37,540
Scott: Yes.

86
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:44,840
Scott: The point of E3 is that companies would show their stuff to each other, see what each other is doing and show their stuff to the press.

87
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:49,320
Scott: And number one, it's becoming too expensive to go to E3 as a company.

88
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:57,300
Scott: It's much cheaper to just put your press release out on the Internet or hold a little press conference or make a website or put it, you know, anything like that.

89
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:58,880
Scott: And it's just as effective.

90
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,780
Scott: Back in the day, you needed a trade show.

91
00:06:00,982 --> 00:06:01,673
Scott: Now you don't.

92
00:06:02,381 --> 00:06:08,946
Scott: And E3 is a lot more expensive than a press release on the Internet to Engadget or to Kotaku or any other video game.

93
00:06:08,986 --> 00:06:15,580
Scott: blog or IGN can put out your, you know, news just as effectively if you just send them a note with a picture.

94
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:22,900
Scott: So these companies all spend money on E3 and they're not getting so much.

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,700
Scott: What they're getting is a bunch of gamers waiting in line to play the Wii and they're not getting enough press people enough time playing the Wii.

96
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,253
Rym: Yeah.

97
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:33,620
Rym: Well, Sony didn't have this problem, at least no one is waiting in line to play their stuff.

98
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,100
Rym: Yeah.

99
00:06:34,741 --> 00:06:41,260
Scott: I mean, the way it's really supposed to be is that you assume that everyone walking around the convention is either press or industry.

100
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:49,200
Scott: So what happens, though, is at E3, they have to have all this stuff behind closed doors and that way you can't get as many press people seeing it.

101
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,460
Rym: But the thing is, E3 was supposed to be the thing behind closed doors.

102
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,800
Rym: You shouldn't have closed doors inside of the closed doors.

103
00:06:55,102 --> 00:06:57,259
Rym: That's like the champagne room and there's no sex in there.

104
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:57,815
Scott: Yeah.

105
00:07:01,002 --> 00:07:02,700
Rym: There's just champagne and a PSP.

106
00:07:04,661 --> 00:07:07,980
Scott: So E3 is really not what it's supposed to be.

107
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:16,360
Scott: Another thing about E3 is that it's supposed to be a place where, since it's just industry and press, the small guy can get noticed.

108
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:23,221
Scott: He can set up a booth and show off his amazing new gaming technology and all the cool press type.

109
00:07:23,262 --> 00:07:27,100
Scott: people will see it because normally they wouldn't pay attention to that shit.

110
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:33,180
Scott: But they walk around E3, they see all the major players, and then they walk over and they see all the small time players.

111
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,999
Scott: And if you have a good show in your booth, they'll maybe say something about it.

112
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:44,159
Rym: Now the thing is, the news so far is that E3 is trying to go back to its roots of generally press and industry only.

113
00:07:45,102 --> 00:07:49,585
Rym: It looks like they're going to downsize significantly and not let the teeming, mouth-breathing masses in.

114
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,440
Scott: And they're also trying to make it no longer the Sony/Microsoft/Nintendo show that it's become.

115
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,700
Scott: They're trying to make it more of a, you know, the whole gaming industry show.

116
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,840
Rym: All the people who couldn't have a press release that anyone would care about.

117
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:12,780
Scott: Yep, they're going to finally get what they want at E3, and the press people will be happy because now they don't have to wait in a freaking line to do their job behind a million crazy fanboys.

118
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:24,176
Rym: Now the one thing I wonder, one, and this is really related to my second thing, that Penny Arcade is generally regarded as the most influential entity on gaming in America today.

119
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:25,639
Scott: One of them.

120
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,999
Rym: Yeah, they're up there.

121
00:08:27,281 --> 00:08:29,360
Rym: They are definitely very, very influential.

122
00:08:30,241 --> 00:08:33,578
Rym: I assume that the new E3 will still allow them in as press.

123
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:40,919
Scott: But here's the thing, what's Penny Arcade going to do if there aren't a million crazy fans to come visit them at the convention, at the E3 Tracer?

124
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,220
Rym: Well, I know what Taika will do.

125
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:45,380
Rym: He'll wander around looking at all the indie games and then talk about them at length.

126
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,098
Scott: That's what he will do, yes.

127
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:53,535
Scott: But it's going to be, you know, for some people, you know, there's going to be less reason for them to go to E3.

128
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,180
Rym: But the thing is, a lot of the people who will have less reason to go are the people that they don't want there in the first place.

129
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:58,600
Rym: Yep.

130
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:14,720
Scott: Now here's another thing, is that since E3 was supposed to be a trade show, but has become more of a convention/trade show, if they try to kick the convention stuff out, which I think they should, all those convention people, they might migrate to PAX.

131
00:09:15,363 --> 00:09:18,400
Rym: Now, this is my RIMS official GeekNights prediction.

132
00:09:19,301 --> 00:09:30,537
Rym: I think that if this happens, and E3 actually does kick out all the fans and all the people who aren't part of the industry, that the Penny Arcade Expo is going to explode, absolutely explode.

133
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,440
Rym: I mean, it's already, I would say, the number two video game con in America.

134
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,219
Scott: Now here's another thing, though.

135
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,060
Scott: Think about that for a second.

136
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:43,912
Scott: Penny Arcade is a webcomic that was started five, six, something years ago, seven years ago.

137
00:09:44,643 --> 00:09:49,138
Rym: A little more, I don't actually remember when it started, all I know is I can't imagine a time when I didn't read it.

138
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,454
Scott: Yeah, it started like late high school, early college, so '99, 2000, right?

139
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,220
Rym: Yeah, but as big as it is, it's just a webcomic.

140
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:07,720
Scott: It's a webcomic, and the webcomic was so popular, and there was a webcomic about video games that they made a little video game convention, a little gaming convention in Seattle-ish area, right?

141
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:09,139
Rym: They've had, what, two of them?

142
00:10:09,461 --> 00:10:10,960
Scott: I think there's been two or three of them, yeah.

143
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:15,400
Rym: And it's already become a very large convention, especially compared to most other kinds.

144
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:23,199
Scott: And if E3 goes down, and all those E3 people who can't get into E3 now go to PAX instead, think about that.

145
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:30,852
Scott: A webcomic, one webcomic has its own convention, and it becomes as crazy as the convention part of E3.

146
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:36,280
Rym: I mean, for all of you who think, "Oh, Megatokyo was huge back in the day," Megatokyo never had a convention.

147
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,360
Scott: Yeah, Megatokyo had a panel at Otakon that had a long line.

148
00:10:39,703 --> 00:10:41,700
Scott: He never had his own convention.

149
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,018
Rym: Not only their own, but two!

150
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,600
Rym: Penny Arcade is thinking seriously about having an East Coast and a West Coast PAX.

151
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,740
Scott: That's been rumored.

152
00:10:49,201 --> 00:10:52,280
Scott: I hope so, because it's hard to go to West Coast PAX.

153
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,634
Rym: Yes, hence I covered my butt by saying "thinking about," though I can say with fair certainty that we're going to PAX next year.

154
00:10:56,694 --> 00:10:57,180
Rym: come hell.

155
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,900
Scott: Yeah, I think I have to agree.

156
00:11:01,925 --> 00:11:03,938
Scott: So yeah, E3, what are they gonna do?

157
00:11:04,601 --> 00:11:05,480
Scott: We'll find out Monday.

158
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,700
Scott: You probably already know, because it's Tuesday.

159
00:11:08,182 --> 00:11:08,338
Scott: Yes.

160
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,220
Scott: But here, it's Sunday.

161
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,000
Rym: And we don't have another news, because we think that covered it for news.

162
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,258
Scott: Yeah, I think so, too.

163
00:11:22,761 --> 00:11:24,280
Scott: And things of the day!

164
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,040
Scott: Things of tomorrow!

165
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,819
Scott: Wait, no, things of two days ago.

166
00:11:29,741 --> 00:11:38,520
Rym: Alright, anyway, this I actually didn't have a good thing of the day, and I didn't feel like trolling around, so I did my usual "look on Google" video for something funny.

167
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:46,859
Rym: Now for anyone who watches the show Reno 911, which I don't, but I've seen many episodes and clips of it over the years, and I do enjoy the show.

168
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,420
Rym: Maybe partly due to my general distrust of police officers, which you're gonna hear about at some point in the future.

169
00:11:53,661 --> 00:12:11,140
Rym: Anyway, this is a bit that has probably been seen fairly widely, but I find it hilarious of some guy playing D&D LARP, and he's shot another guy with an arrow, and the two Reno 911 police guys are trying to get out of him why he shot this guy with the arrow.

170
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:16,979
Rym: And if you've ever played a live-action role-playing game, or Dungeons & Dragons, you will find this hilarious.

171
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:24,478
Scott: Yeah, that's the only problem with it, is it's really not funny if you don't understand D&D, because the guy runs away and he's like, "Hey, boots of what,

172
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:24,820
Scott: escaping?"

173
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,001
Scott: Boots

174
00:12:25,042 --> 00:12:26,895
Rym: of escaping, and the cop pulls out a gun and is like,

175
00:12:26,975 --> 00:12:27,257
Scott: "Bam!"

176
00:12:28,821 --> 00:12:30,915
Rym: Plus the fact that the one cop knows about the game.

177
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:38,755
Rym: So he's like, "I rolled an 18," and the cop's like, "Yes, you rolled an 18 and you hit him right there with the three-point arm," and the other cop's like, "Shut

178
00:12:38,896 --> 00:12:38,956
Rym: up.".

179
00:12:40,545 --> 00:12:41,600
Rym: It's funny, it's worth watching.

180
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,380
Scott: Alright, mine needs a little explanation.

181
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:52,500
Scott: On BoardGameGeek.com, which is a website that has a database of every board game, and it's pretty much the only website for board gaming on the internet.

182
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,440
Rym: We've linked to it many times.

183
00:12:54,540 --> 00:13:01,359
Scott: Yes, they have a feature known as the Geek List, and what you can do is you can make a list of things, usually games.

184
00:13:02,621 --> 00:13:11,900
Scott: And you make a list of games, and at the top you post what the list is, and then below you have the list of games, and then people can comment on each item in the list.

185
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,857
Scott: It's actually pretty cool.

186
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,100
Scott: Someone made a list that's pretty interesting that I felt like making it a thing of the day.

187
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:27,420
Scott: The list is free computer versions of board and card games with artificial intelligence computer opponents and with screenshots.

188
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,779
Rym: It is exactly what that says.

189
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,119
Scott: It is exactly what that says.

190
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:43,659
Scott: So if there are board games or card games that you want to play against AI computer opponents and you would like to see screenshots of those games before you play them for free, this is a list of some of them.

191
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,400
Scott: The top one is a game of Tigris and Euphrates that I've tried to play, and it never really works so well.

192
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,860
Scott: I think it's because I have a bad Java or it's poorly written.

193
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:54,319
Rym: I consider it unplayable.

194
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:54,750
Scott: Yeah.

195
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:58,060
Scott: The next one is Modern Art, which is pretty cool.

196
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,158
Scott: It's a bidding game.

197
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,853
Scott: San Juan, Web of Power, St.

198
00:14:03,913 --> 00:14:06,080
Scott: Petersburg, Space Hulk, you get the idea.

199
00:14:06,682 --> 00:14:15,540
Scott: All these board and card games that people really like, and free downloadable or web playable versions of those games that you don't need friends to play.

200
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,251
Rym: Alright.

201
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,999
Scott: Very useful for learning new games, especially complicated ones like EuroRail.

202
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:27,579
Rym: Well I remember way back when Scojo and Alicia would play Settlers Online to the exclusion of life itself.

203
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,340
Scott: Yeah, I played Settlers Online, but not to the exclusion of anything else.

204
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,276
Rym: Yeah, of course playing Settlers Online was just cemented home into us.

205
00:14:35,316 --> 00:14:36,937
Rym: the idea that Settlers is a broken game.

206
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:45,519
Scott: In fact, the Java version of Settlers and the Microsoft version that is not free is also on the list.

207
00:14:46,165 --> 00:14:46,380
Rym: Uh-huh.

208
00:14:46,924 --> 00:14:47,070
Scott: Mm-hmm.

209
00:14:47,745 --> 00:14:47,920
Rym: Alright.

210
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:56,879
Rym: Now, we've been debating buying Super Mario Strikers for a long time, and we nominally were waiting until it fell in price.

211
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,492
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's a $50 game.

212
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:00,480
Scott: It's hard to find it used.

213
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,500
Scott: I tried to buy it on eBay for $40 instead of $50, and I got outbid.

214
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:05,491
Scott: So...

215
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,940
Rym: The price never came down.

216
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,498
Rym: So the other day...

217
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,780
Scott: And it seemed like stores were running out of copies, like it wasn't an easy game to get anymore.

218
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,180
Scott: It used to be everywhere, and now it was sort of disappearing.

219
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:25,120
Rym: Yep, so finally we were bored, mostly because there aren't many good two-player games, other than Advance Wars, which Scott won't play with me, and Hellas, which is...

220
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,079
Scott: I will, just not often.

221
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:32,100
Rym: Hellas, which is a terrible game, and games we've already beaten, or require three or four people.

222
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,499
Scott: So now we've played Mario Strikers, which is soccer, Mario soccer, in the store on demo machines, and it's a lot of fun.

223
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:45,092
Scott: And I wanted it, I wanted it, I wasn't gonna pay $50 for it, I finally said, "Fine, I'll pay $50 for it,".

224
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:45,518
Scott: and I bought it.

225
00:15:46,163 --> 00:15:47,500
Scott: And I think it was worth $50.

226
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:53,200
Rym: I'll say right now, if you don't have time to listen to the whole episode, Super Mario Strikers is freaking badass.

227
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,560
Rym: It is an amazing, awesome, incredibly fun game.

228
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,068
Scott: Yep.

229
00:15:57,741 --> 00:15:59,880
Scott: Now, basically, you play soccer.

230
00:16:00,421 --> 00:16:03,960
Rym: Now, the difference is that there are no, really, rules.

231
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:11,779
Rym: I mean, there's no offsides, there's no out-of-bounds, you can kill the other guy, you can throw shells at each other.

232
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:19,416
Scott: Sort of like NBA Jam, or, you know, you can just hit people, dunk, break the Rym, do whatever you want.

233
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:29,220
Rym: Now, in keeping with all of the other Mario sports games, the controls are very simple, and yet at the same time allow for a great wealth of strategy and skilled play.

234
00:16:29,493 --> 00:16:29,619
Rym: Yep.

235
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,600
Scott: Basically, what you can do is, well, let's describe the game.

236
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,140
Scott: It's not real soccer, like FIFA soccer.

237
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,780
Rym: It's four-on-four soccer.

238
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,080
Scott: It's five-on-five with, you know, one of the people as a goal.

239
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,040
Rym: Oh yeah, with the alligator.

240
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:49,720
Scott: You pick first your team captain, which is Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Waluigi, Wario, Yoshi, Donkey Kong.

241
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,600
Rym: And the secret one, which, spoiler alert, it's a robot.

242
00:16:54,084 --> 00:16:54,780
Scott: It's not cool.

243
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,340
Scott: It's kind of lame, and it's a cheap.

244
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,617
Scott: It's basically, you should only use that team if you're nubs, because that's sort of a cheating team.

245
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,999
Rym: Unless we both use that team.

246
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:03,440
Scott: Yeah.

247
00:17:03,762 --> 00:17:04,377
Scott: Then it would be fair.

248
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:12,419
Scott: But anyway, then you choose your sidekicks, which are Toads, Birdos, Koopa Troopas, and Hammer Brothers.

249
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:13,560
Rym: Yeah, Hammer Brothers.

250
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,599
Scott: And you get three of those, so let's say you pick Luigi, Hammer Brother.

251
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,900
Scott: Your team consists of a Luigi and three Hammer Brothers.

252
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:24,240
Scott: Your goalie is always an alligator from Donkey Kong.

253
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,118
Rym: Who you don't control.

254
00:17:25,362 --> 00:17:27,359
Scott: You don't control the goalie at all.

255
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:27,834
Scott: None.

256
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,160
Scott: You can't even enable goalie control.

257
00:17:30,941 --> 00:17:33,139
Scott: And it's a good thing and a bad thing.

258
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:39,040
Scott: It's a good thing because the game now is mostly the strategy of, you know, field strategy.

259
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:44,880
Scott: And you don't have to worry about, you know, trying to control the goalie while you're also trying to take the ball away from the opponent.

260
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:56,360
Scott: But at the same time, is it really now a game of you versus your opponent, or is it a game of who is better against the computer-controlled goalies, me or the Rym?

261
00:17:56,841 --> 00:18:05,239
Rym: I think it's still the former, mainly because while you can figure out ways to get around the goalie, and in fact, the instruction book and such kind of give you hints at how to get around the goalie.

262
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,319
Rym: And there are a lot of very well-defined ways to get around the goalie.

263
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,939
Rym: But everyone knows those.

264
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:20,200
Rym: So the game is still, how do I set this up so I can get it through the goalie when he knows what I'm trying to do, and he's about to slam my dude against that electric fence?

265
00:18:20,481 --> 00:18:31,560
Scott: Yeah, it really, what it does is it's not a game about scoring goals so much as is it a game about maneuvering your guys on the field in a strategic way in real time.

266
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,640
Rym: Now the controls, well like I said, are very simple.

267
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,620
Rym: But generally, you hit A to pass and B to shoot.

268
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,740
Rym: And then variations thereof.

269
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,458
Rym: Like if you're on your own side and you hit B, instead of shooting, you clear it to the other side.

270
00:18:45,441 --> 00:18:50,880
Rym: And you can hold L down to modify either an A or B to do a lob shot or a lob pass.

271
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,460
Scott: That kind of puts it up in the air.

272
00:18:52,780 --> 00:19:00,500
Scott: So like if I want to pass it to my teammate, and there's a guy on the other team in the way, a lob pass will go over his head instead of on the ground.

273
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,160
Rym: But also, the person catching a lob pass has to slow down and spend some time catching.

274
00:19:04,281 --> 00:19:05,978
Scott: Yeah, they have to jump up and get it.

275
00:19:06,481 --> 00:19:08,680
Scott: So, you know, you gotta really think about what you're doing.

276
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:17,620
Rym: And then there's also a nice mechanic of when you have the ball, say I hit A to pass and before it hits the guy I'm passing it to, I hit A again and let go.

277
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,358
Rym: When it hits him, he'll automatically and immediately do a one-touch pass to the next person.

278
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:23,098
Scott: From the air.

279
00:19:23,881 --> 00:19:35,460
Scott: It's a lot like Smash Brothers and other fighting games where there's very specific commands and animations that guys do and you have to optimize them to make exactly what you want to happen happen.

280
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:42,480
Rym: So you tap like AAB when you have your guys set up and it'll go pass, pass, and the third guy will automatically shoot at the goal.

281
00:19:43,102 --> 00:19:49,176
Scott: And there's all sorts of things like if a guy gets the ball and then pushes A, he'll pass it.

282
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:59,800
Scott: But if you push A, if the ball is loose and you push A as you approach the ball, he'll do like an off the cuff pass and it's a different kind of thing and it works differently.

283
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,279
Scott: It's actually better in some ways.

284
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,659
Rym: And with shots, you can also charge it up.

285
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,700
Rym: And normally you hold B down and the longer you hold it, the stronger your shot is.

286
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,660
Rym: And your non-main character dudes will max out at a certain point.

287
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,218
Rym: But your main character can hold it for a while and do a super shot.

288
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:21,119
Rym: where then there's a mini, you know, hit A in the right sequence to be able to do the super shot.

289
00:20:21,139 --> 00:20:23,380
Rym: that gets you two points and gets by the goalie automatically.

290
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:28,460
Scott: And it's like you can't let the team, only the team captain can make the super shot.

291
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:39,073
Rym: And it's not at all unbalancing or cheat because you, it's really hard to pull off because you need to be sitting wide open for a long time without anyone coming up and bothering you.

292
00:20:39,381 --> 00:20:44,700
Rym: Now it really adds a lot to the game in the fact that a breakaway in this game alone means nothing.

293
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,277
Rym: So by adding this, if you have a breakaway, that just means you have a chance to pull this off.

294
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,060
Scott: There's also the strategy of you get items in the game.

295
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,340
Scott: You get items for different things.

296
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,914
Scott: I think you get an item whenever you make a shot on goal.

297
00:20:56,974 --> 00:20:58,919
Scott: if it's blocked by the goalie that would have gone in.

298
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,160
Scott: Yep.

299
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,500
Rym: You get an item if the other person checks or slide tackles one of your guys when he doesn't have the ball.

300
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:04,940
Scott: Right.

301
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:09,180
Scott: So if you have the ball, you can, if you hit the person who has the ball, that's fine.

302
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,060
Scott: If you hit the person who just had the ball, that's fine.

303
00:21:12,801 --> 00:21:17,999
Scott: If you hit the person who doesn't have the ball at all, they get an item or their items get better.

304
00:21:18,363 --> 00:21:19,498
Scott: So you don't want to do that.

305
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:27,060
Rym: Granted, if there's a key strategy, like if Scott's about to shoot and I know it's going to go in, I'll do everything I can to slide tackle the guy who's passing it to him.

306
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:32,100
Scott: Or if the other guy already has some awesome items, hit him all over the place, who cares if his items get better.

307
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,900
Rym: Because once his items max out, they can't get better than that.

308
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:38,460
Scott: Of course, there are some very rare, very good items like the Chain Chomp.

309
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:38,998
Rym: The Chain Chomp?

310
00:21:39,141 --> 00:21:40,160
Scott: And the Golden Star.

311
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:46,420
Rym: Oh, I forget the exact words from the instruction book, but the Chain Chomp annihilates the other team in its entirety for a short amount of time.

312
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:57,800
Scott: So if you keep hitting the other team when they don't have the ball, then eventually they'll get a Chain Chomp, which means they push one button and your whole team is wiped out and they got clear to make the awesome shot.

313
00:21:59,582 --> 00:22:02,200
Scott: So yeah, there's other strategies to use the items.

314
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:11,920
Scott: So let's say I'm running down the field and I pass it to my team captain and then he shoots the red shells and it knocks down the other team and then he takes the super shot.

315
00:22:12,682 --> 00:22:13,759
Scott: It's strategies like that.

316
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,380
Rym: Or Scott's got a breakaway and he's about to do the super shot.

317
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,998
Rym: I use a mushroom and send my toad on super speed to slide tackle him from behind and stop it.

318
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:30,200
Scott: But not only that, but when you're making the super shot, this meter appears on the screen and you have to put the little lines inside the green areas on this meter.

319
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:30,979
Scott: It's not easy.

320
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,000
Scott: It's really hard to do it every time, but the other player can wiggle the C-stick and it shakes your meter.

321
00:22:37,301 --> 00:22:39,700
Scott: So it's really hard to put it in the green area.

322
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,220
Rym: Now other controls that you might need to be aware of is that when you're on the defensive, you can hit A to change between your characters.

323
00:22:46,661 --> 00:22:47,199
Scott: You can do that.

324
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,560
Rym: It's kind of like passing.

325
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,019
Rym: Well, you can't do it when you have the ball.

326
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:50,454
Scott: Right.

327
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:50,800
Scott: Right.

328
00:22:50,961 --> 00:22:52,340
Rym: It's like passing, but there's no balls.

329
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,140
Rym: So it's instantaneous.

330
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:53,288
Rym: Yep.

331
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:57,720
Rym: You can hit B to do a slide tackle and all the sidekicks do it differently.

332
00:22:58,161 --> 00:22:59,660
Rym: Some go further, some hit harder.

333
00:23:00,202 --> 00:23:03,079
Rym: And if you slide tackle someone successfully and they have the ball, you take it from them.

334
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:05,640
Rym: Or you can hit Y to do a hard hit.

335
00:23:06,561 --> 00:23:10,577
Rym: When you hit someone hard, you knock them down and they're out of commission for a little bit.

336
00:23:10,861 --> 00:23:13,160
Rym: And if you hit them into the wall, they're out of commission even longer.

337
00:23:13,743 --> 00:23:14,700
Rym: But you don't get the ball.

338
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:17,880
Rym: The ball just kind of gets knocked freely and then anyone can grab it who's nearby.

339
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:18,529
Scott: Yeah.

340
00:23:19,101 --> 00:23:22,640
Scott: There's two different hits and you have to figure out which one to use depending on the situation.

341
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:32,240
Scott: You know, like if someone is a little farther away, maybe your guys slide tackle farther, but maybe someone's about to make a supercharged up shot.

342
00:23:32,341 --> 00:23:33,739
Scott: Well, you need to knock them down fast.

343
00:23:33,881 --> 00:23:34,520
Scott: Use the power hit.

344
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:40,340
Rym: The only other control is that you can use the Y button or the C stick when you have the ball to deke.

345
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,759
Rym: Now say you're running and there's a defender in front of you.

346
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:48,117
Rym: If you implement it, if you do it successfully, you can kind of dodge around him before he slide tackles you.

347
00:23:49,001 --> 00:23:54,240
Rym: And also when you're about to shoot, you can use that to fake the goalie out or fake the opponent out.

348
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,257
Rym: I was going to shoot, but I wasn't.

349
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,120
Scott: You can also fake the opponent.

350
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,400
Scott: Like if you'd start charging up a shot, you can push A while it's charging to pass instead.

351
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:08,820
Rym: It's a great strategy to run up, charge up, and just before the guy behind you slide tackles you, do a pass, pass, and then a shot.

352
00:24:09,021 --> 00:24:10,540
Rym: So it'll go bink, bink, and then go in.

353
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,759
Scott: Or it's like a pass and a lob shot or something like that.

354
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,799
Scott: There's a lot of really good stuff you can do.

355
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:24,599
Scott: Also, if you pass to someone who is like in the prime area for scoring a goal, the ball will have this trail behind it.

356
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:33,920
Scott: And if you push B or A while that trail is on the ball, then your guy will either do what is known as a perfect shot or a perfect pass.

357
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,299
Scott: It's kind of fancy.

358
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:40,098
Scott: It really, it just looks like the game slows down a bit like, "Oh no,

359
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:40,420
Scott: shits!".

360
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,745
Rym: It's like perfect slow motion.

361
00:24:41,805 --> 00:24:54,360
Rym: and there was a beautiful moment at one point where I was running behind a guy who had the ball, Scott's guy, and he just passed it to a person who was doing the slow motion thing, but I had just started a hard tackle.

362
00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:06,879
Rym: So I see his guy like flipping up to do the bicycle kick in slow motion, meanwhile I see my guy just slamming his guy and you see the guy falling to the ground face first in slow motion as the ball goes in.

363
00:25:07,121 --> 00:25:07,510
Rym: And as soon as...

364
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,756
Scott: Yep, yep, yep.

365
00:25:09,461 --> 00:25:13,800
Scott: Also, you can do like perfect lob passes and perfect lob shots.

366
00:25:14,002 --> 00:25:15,420
Scott: It gets really complex.

367
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:27,300
Scott: You know, that's how you get the guys to do the crazy aerial maneuvers, is you do like a lob pass to the guy when he's right in front of the goal and you push B and he'll jump up in the air and do like a hurricane kick or something.

368
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,020
Rym: Now the only other control is that when the goalie has the ball, and one, the goalie is invincible.

369
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,458
Rym: Items do not hurt him.

370
00:25:33,801 --> 00:25:36,639
Rym: If you go anywhere near him and you're an opponent, he will punch you.

371
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,499
Scott: And frickin' kick your ass, too.

372
00:25:38,801 --> 00:25:39,560
Scott: It really sucks.

373
00:25:39,761 --> 00:25:44,540
Rym: If you hit him straight on with balls enough, he'll get dizzy for a minute.

374
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,919
Scott: Yeah, like if you charge up a shot and kick it straight in his face, he'll be dizzy.

375
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,120
Scott: Which means if you can get another shot off quick enough, it's gonna go in.

376
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:59,260
Rym: He's also realistic, like say you have a guy in the way and Scott shoots at my goalie, but one of my toads jumps in front of it and blocks the shot.

377
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:06,740
Rym: The goalie already committed, so he still dives for the shot and he's still out of place if Scott shoots again, just like it would have been in a real game of football.

378
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:14,680
Scott: Yeah, it's not, the goalie's not invincible, but depending on the difficulty level you set the game at, and it has four difficulty levels, it's harder to get around him.

379
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:22,800
Rym: But if the goalie gets the ball, you can hit A to pass the ball short to someone, or you can hit B to lob clear the ball all the way to the other side of the screen.

380
00:26:23,342 --> 00:26:24,240
Scott: And that's Mario soccer.

381
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:28,219
Rym: That's the whole game, other than they're the characters, and they're all different as usual.

382
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,700
Rym: You know, Peach and Daisy are faster, Waluigi is tricky, I like Waluigi.

383
00:26:34,082 --> 00:26:38,300
Scott: DK and Wario are slower, but they're really, really powerful.

384
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,818
Rym: The sidekicks are all different too.

385
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:46,820
Scott: Yeah, so you can do Luigi and Hammer Brothers, or Luigi and Koopa Troopas, or Luigi and toads.

386
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:52,380
Scott: And it's all different, the toads are fast, the Burdos are really aggressive.

387
00:26:52,960 --> 00:27:00,260
Rym: Yeah, it's really, no one has done a fact of exactly what the differences are yet, but it seems to be that the Burdos are good on general offense.

388
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,840
Rym: The Hammer Brothers are real good at straight on headers.

389
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,398
Scott: It seems that's what they're straight at.

390
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,920
Rym: And I do notice one thing, the Hammer Brothers slide tackle is really long.

391
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,920
Scott: It is, it is, I like that a lot.

392
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:19,480
Scott: Like I started using the Hammer Brothers, and I basically used the slide tackle exclusively, except for the very rare case when I need to use the hard frickin' hit.

393
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:24,840
Rym: Now in terms of the game itself, it's fantastic, and there's not much we can say other than that it's a fantastic game.

394
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,360
Rym: It's one, two, three, or four player.

395
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:28,739
Rym: You can do co-op, you can do three on one.

396
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,540
Scott: That's one thing that's really good, is to unlock all the stuff, of course you have to play, you know, the one player tournament thing.

397
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:47,260
Scott: And you can play, which Mario Tennis didn't allow you to do, because you had to play in Mario Tennis to unlock everything, the single player doubles, which meant it was you and a computer opponent versus two computer opponents.

398
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:57,160
Scott: And it's very annoying to play that way and be forced to face incredibly difficult computer opponents when one of the people on your team is a computer controlled opponent.

399
00:27:58,221 --> 00:28:12,940
Scott: In this, it allows you in the single player cup modes to have more than one person on a team, so you could actually play the one player game, well the tournament cup game, with four people on your team, all controlling a different character.

400
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,839
Rym: Now another, aside from the gameplay, because there's not much more we can say about it, that's really it, and it's fun.

401
00:28:19,061 --> 00:28:20,280
Scott: It's soccer, it's a lot of fun.

402
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:26,799
Rym: But there's, like remember when Smash Brothers came out for the GameCube and there was so much color in the game and just little things.

403
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:34,139
Rym: This game is chock full of that, every character has numerous animations of their reactions to everything that happens.

404
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:37,180
Scott: You will get tired of them because there aren't really that many.

405
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,140
Rym: But there's enough to where it's really high energy and they're really amusing.

406
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,340
Scott: Yeah, some of them are really amusing.

407
00:28:43,881 --> 00:28:47,360
Rym: Like Waluigi actually makes the "Suck My Dick" maneuver.

408
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,099
Rym: He straight up points at his penis like he wants you to suck it.

409
00:28:51,444 --> 00:28:51,699
Scott: Yeah.

410
00:28:52,548 --> 00:28:53,180
Rym: It's hilarious.

411
00:28:53,542 --> 00:28:57,179
Scott: Like Daisy licks her finger and touches her ass and it actually steams.

412
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,087
Rym: And then she's like,

413
00:28:58,148 --> 00:28:58,372
Rym: "Hot!".

414
00:28:59,001 --> 00:29:00,280
Rym: Actually Daisy has my favorite one.

415
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:00,483
Scott: She goes,

416
00:29:00,503 --> 00:29:00,726
Scott: "Daisy!".

417
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:07,639
Rym: Sometimes when she wins, or when she gets a shot off, she runs away, pumping her arms in the air, just yelling, "Yes!

418
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:07,969
Rym: Yes!

419
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:08,442
Rym: Yes!".

420
00:29:08,563 --> 00:29:10,200
Rym: and it's just so natural and hilarious.

421
00:29:10,621 --> 00:29:15,192
Scott: It's really hilarious because you have this semi-hot body with this weird Daisy head on it.

422
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:21,880
Rym: I did read somewhere that, because someone actually mentioned in GameFacts how come the girls are wearing slightly skimpy outfits.

423
00:29:22,042 --> 00:29:23,879
Rym: It's not the kind of thing you see in Nintendo games.

424
00:29:24,641 --> 00:29:29,977
Rym: And I read, I haven't verified this, that another company designed the models and the stuff they wear.

425
00:29:31,344 --> 00:29:32,520
Rym: I don't know, I didn't read much about it.

426
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,980
Scott: Yeah, it's like Next whatever games.

427
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:39,099
Rym: Yeah, but they had a lot more say in the game than other companies that did similar games have had in the past.

428
00:29:39,242 --> 00:29:40,200
Rym: Or they took more liberties.

429
00:29:41,283 --> 00:29:42,559
Rym: I'm not sure about the details of that.

430
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:49,359
Scott: Yeah, they definitely made the game, like if you think that Mario Tennis and Mario Golf are sort of like kiddie-ish, you know?

431
00:29:49,801 --> 00:29:50,296
Scott: Who knew?

432
00:29:50,823 --> 00:29:51,057
Scott: Yeah.

433
00:29:52,121 --> 00:29:58,180
Scott: Mario Strikers is definitely geared towards a slightly more into it sports-only.

434
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,780
Scott: Kind of like that, what was that basketball game for the GameCube that just happened to have Mario characters in it?

435
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:03,520
Scott: Oh yeah, yeah.

436
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,420
Scott: Like NBA Street something something.

437
00:30:06,122 --> 00:30:07,419
Scott: It's definitely more like that.

438
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,117
Scott: Like this isn't really super cartoony, happy, cute Nintendo.

439
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,360
Scott: This is really like a street kind of style soccer.

440
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,500
Rym: Yeah, like all those animations, those don't apply to just the main characters.

441
00:30:18,801 --> 00:30:25,537
Rym: The Toads and the Koopas have them too, and they're all, I mean, sometimes a Toad will score a goal, and he runs away just like, "Yes, yes, yes, yes,

442
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:25,718
Rym: yes!".

443
00:30:26,182 --> 00:30:27,640
Scott: Yeah, and the Toads have evil eyes.

444
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,419
Scott: Well, some of them do.

445
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,138
Scott: Most of them do.

446
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,300
Scott: Depends on the animation.

447
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:37,860
Scott: Like, the Hammer Brother is the best, because what he does is he runs, and then he jumps and lands on his back and kind of slides like a turtle shell.

448
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,438
Scott: Yeah, and pumpin'.

449
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:38,864
Rym: He's like,

450
00:30:38,925 --> 00:30:39,389
Rym: "Yeah!"

451
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:41,540
Rym: And it's just fantastic.

452
00:30:42,325 --> 00:30:42,940
Scott: It's really good.

453
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:47,880
Rym: The game is extremely high energy and extremely, extremely immersive.

454
00:30:48,723 --> 00:30:50,099
Scott: It's real fast-paced action.

455
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:57,740
Rym: I mean, the music's just pumping the whole time, the music's pretty good, the sound effects are really well done, and really, the game pumps you up like a Eurobeat song would.

456
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:58,699
Scott: Kinda, yeah.

457
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,200
Scott: I mean, one of the problems with the game is that there really aren't enough arenas.

458
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,180
Scott: Like at first, there's like three arenas available, so I unlocked the rest of them.

459
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,820
Scott: I really only unlocked four more arenas for a total of seven.

460
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,960
Rym: And they're not different enough for me to care at all.

461
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,438
Scott: Yeah, there's really, I don't really care which arena it is, and they're kind of all the same.

462
00:31:18,401 --> 00:31:23,579
Scott: Really, I like the, it's not like Smash Brothers, where the arena matters a lot and there's a lot of variety going on.

463
00:31:23,922 --> 00:31:24,680
Scott: It's sort of boring.

464
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,640
Rym: Yeah, it does seem that if this game had come out in the early days of the GameCube...

465
00:31:29,761 --> 00:31:30,520
Scott: That would have been much better.

466
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,340
Rym: ...they would have added a lot more to it, because they were really trying to impress people.

467
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:40,420
Rym: And now, it seems like they could have done more with the game, but that doesn't really matter because the game as it stands is freaking badass.

468
00:31:41,022 --> 00:31:41,980
Scott: Yeah, that's another thing.

469
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,560
Scott: I would have liked more game modes.

470
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,559
Scott: Like, you know, Mario Tennis, you can play tennis, you can play the coin, you can play the rings.

471
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:55,119
Rym: But then again, I really don't like any of those other modes in Mario Tennis, and after playing them a few times, I was totally sick of them.

472
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,698
Rym: And I only wanted to play the main game, so it seems like it was almost wasted effort.

473
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,620
Scott: Eh, I like to play the other modes occasionally, you know.

474
00:32:01,661 --> 00:32:02,759
Rym: I can't stand any of them.

475
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:03,594
Scott: Oh, because sometimes...

476
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,520
Rym: The only one I like at all is the Chain Chomp Bomb Water one.

477
00:32:07,806 --> 00:32:08,080
Rym: At all.

478
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:08,819
Rym: There's only one.

479
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,759
Scott: There's those things, too.

480
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,780
Rym: No, only that one.

481
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,519
Rym: I hate the rest of them.

482
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,759
Scott: Well, you hate the rest of them.

483
00:32:12,922 --> 00:32:13,213
Scott: Yeah, I do.

484
00:32:13,621 --> 00:32:16,478
Scott: I think that, you know, you have a game, and it only has one mode.

485
00:32:17,081 --> 00:32:18,600
Scott: When that mode runs out, you're done.

486
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:24,100
Scott: It's good to have other modes to fall back on, because you play those, and then the original mode becomes interesting again.

487
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,859
Rym: But the Mario Tennis mode never ran out.

488
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,940
Rym: I never got sick of that game.

489
00:32:27,582 --> 00:32:28,878
Scott: Uh, you know, sometimes...

490
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,718
Rym: I only got sick of playing it with all my friends who suck at it.

491
00:32:32,802 --> 00:32:35,639
Rym: Even though they eventually all got pretty good.

492
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,020
Scott: It just took a lot.

493
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:37,399
Scott: Kinda good.

494
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:41,598
Rym: Yeah, granted, it's not any great skill on our part, it's just that we played the game a lot more.

495
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,027
Scott: Yeah.

496
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:43,040
Rym: That's really all there is to it.

497
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,278
Scott: Well, it is sort of a game of skill, but mostly it's...

498
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,200
Rym: But you learn the skill so quickly by playing.

499
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:53,280
Scott: It's a reflex memorization thing, you know, you can get the skill in your brain, you have to get it into the other part of your brain.

500
00:32:53,780 --> 00:33:04,240
Rym: I highly recommend, as long as you don't live alone, that you buy this game ASAP, because you want to get as much enjoyment out of it as you can now, before the Wii and all these new DS games come out.

501
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,059
Scott: Because then you're never going to look back at this game.

502
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:10,920
Rym: Granted, there isn't going to be another Mario soccer game for a while on the Wii.

503
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:11,352
Rym: Yeah.

504
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:19,780
Rym: So this game will have a lot of staying power, but you're not going to want to play this game compared to all the crazy games that have come out for the Wii right away.

505
00:33:21,262 --> 00:33:23,260
Rym: Plus, the game's not going to come down in price.

506
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,478
Rym: So every day that you wait before you buy it is one day less of value.

507
00:33:27,498 --> 00:33:28,070
Rym: you'll get out of it.

508
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:35,642
Scott: Yeah, you might be able to get it on eBay for between $40 and $50, but you're going to get it at your EB or your GameStop for $50.

509
00:33:35,642 --> 00:33:38,120
Rym: I think, I regret the fact that we didn't buy it sooner.

510
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:38,467
Scott: Yeah.

511
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:44,180
Rym: Because we would have paid the same if we'd bought it four months ago, and it would have been four more months of playing this game.

512
00:33:44,581 --> 00:33:48,360
Scott: The game also just has a tournament mode, but it's just a tournament mode.

513
00:33:48,701 --> 00:33:53,040
Scott: You set up tournaments of knockout style or whatever, and then you have a tournament!

514
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:54,437
Scott: That's what it is.

515
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:59,351
Scott: A lot of games have had that, I mean, there are really old games that had tournament modes in them.

516
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,780
Scott: I mean, Tech Mobile had a tournament mode.

517
00:34:02,961 --> 00:34:03,437
Rym: Yes, it did.

518
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:05,720
Scott: So it's just not very exciting.

519
00:34:06,601 --> 00:34:08,458
Rym: But I think that's enough about that.

520
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:13,572
Rym: Bear in mind that tonight is the last normal episode of GeekNights until two weeks from now.

521
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:18,780
Scott: Well, not two weeks from now, two weeks from, uh, one week from Monday.

522
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:23,520
Rym: The week, the Monday after, the Monday after Otakon.

523
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,560
Scott: So not next Monday, the Monday after that.

524
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,018
Scott: Two Mondays from now.

525
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:37,000
Rym: So of course, tune in tomorrow for our Otakon pregame show, and tune in next week for the GeekNights specials, which will be of varying quality.

526
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:38,418
Scott: Yup.

527
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:48,170
Rym: And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

528
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,809
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

529
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:55,609
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontrowcrew.com.

530
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,670
Scott: If you like our podcasts, you'll love our forums.

531
00:34:58,890 --> 00:34:59,608
Scott: Make sure you visit them.

532
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:03,590
Scott: You can send your email feedback to geeknights@gmail.com.

533
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:06,257
Scott: And if you want, you can leave us a voicemail at 206-333-1537.

534
00:35:10,973 --> 00:35:13,710
Rym: GeekNights airs every weeknight, Monday through Thursday.

535
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:17,630
Scott: GeekNights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

536
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:21,510
Scott: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
