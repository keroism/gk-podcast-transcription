1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,522
Scott: It's Wednesday January 4th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,663 --> 00:00:15,689
Scott: We talk about the boy who saw the wind.

3
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:17,867
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:18,892 --> 00:00:20,669
Rym: So I fell asleep at work again.

5
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:23,381
Scott: You actually fell asleep at work like I

6
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:36,559
Rym: was sitting in the control center this like data center We have with the hum of all the machines and all the coolers And I was looking at a packet capture And I just fell asleep like sitting there staring at it, and then like a minute later I woke up like what what where the hell am I?

7
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:37,121
Rym: oh crap?

8
00:00:37,382 --> 00:00:37,543
Rym: Yeah?

9
00:00:37,965 --> 00:00:38,890
Scott: Wow really asleep?

10
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,590
Rym: Yeah, I really haven't slept more than a few hours since our party on New Year's which was many days ago.

11
00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:48,253
Scott: You know in all of school ever I mean I've rested But I've never.

12
00:00:48,514 --> 00:00:51,005
Scott: I only fell asleep asleep in a class once.

13
00:00:51,307 --> 00:00:52,090
Rym: what in school?

14
00:00:52,191 --> 00:00:55,870
Rym: I would regularly go into a class plop my head down and just go right to sleep.

15
00:00:56,971 --> 00:00:58,214
Scott: Well like purposefully.

16
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:03,690
Scott: I only fell asleep really asleep one time because it was just so damn boring.

17
00:01:04,318 --> 00:01:04,925
Scott: Oh my god

18
00:01:06,672 --> 00:01:23,849
Rym: See I would go to classes specifically to sleep like I'd be tired but I will go to class pretty much just in case the professor decided to give us homework or Told us when the test was and I'd kind of like find out that way or maybe there was homework do and I'd find out That I didn't do it and America turned it in late.

19
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:28,070
Rym: but Other than that I didn't care about anything else going on in the class.

20
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:33,888
Scott: I just sleep in the back, and I always messed up like which classes to go to and which ones not to.

21
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:35,410
Scott: yeah I refresh from in year.

22
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:41,133
Scott: I skipped like a chemistry class on a Friday, and there was a test and you could drop one test But that was the easy test.

23
00:01:41,695 --> 00:01:42,899
Scott: so they don't get a bad grade.

24
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:47,876
Scott: because I skipped the easy test and I took the hard test That came later.

25
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:56,900
Scott: even though I knew all the stuff from like high school chemistry I just totally didn't care about it and forgot yeah luckily I didn't have to take any science at RIT.

26
00:01:56,961 --> 00:02:07,898
Scott: I got that all taking care of in high school Yeah, and then let's see like software engineering There was like a lecture for part of the quarter, and I skipped like all of them But two or something crazy like that.

27
00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:09,244
Scott: I just know I don't even remember the.

28
00:02:09,324 --> 00:02:10,850
Scott: I didn't go to it at like all.

29
00:02:11,534 --> 00:02:22,927
Rym: I don't know what I was thinking, but I probably should have gone to that even though It was kind of crappy and boring one class I accidentally didn't skip like I accidentally went to class because I forgot what day it was and that actually saved me.

30
00:02:22,947 --> 00:02:30,100
Rym: I Was visual basic - and VB is probably the stupidest language ever and the class was stupid.

31
00:02:30,521 --> 00:02:40,129
Rym: and there's a lecture in a lab and the lecture consisted entirely of An exam like 80% your grade this exam And then the rest was a pass/fail lab and like a little bit of lab work.

32
00:02:40,752 --> 00:02:55,887
Rym: so I went to the labs because I had to but I never went to the lecture after the first day and I went on what I thought was the last day of class to take the exam and Then I discovered that actually it was Wednesday, or it was it was Wednesday, but for some reason.

33
00:02:55,907 --> 00:02:56,790
Rym: I thought it was Thursday.

34
00:02:57,651 --> 00:03:00,669
Rym: So and also the exam was two parts over two days.

35
00:03:01,212 --> 00:03:05,407
Rym: So I accidentally showed up the day early when the exam started and thus I didn't fail.

36
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:08,945
Scott: luck Yeah, what if you had gone in the last day?

37
00:03:09,186 --> 00:03:09,589
Rym: You know what?

38
00:03:11,031 --> 00:03:16,227
Rym: About 20 people showed up on the first day of the exam and about 60 people showed up on the second day.

39
00:03:16,247 --> 00:03:19,723
Rym: Wow Yeah, that's how awesome that class was.

40
00:03:20,426 --> 00:03:21,029
Scott: that's awesome.

41
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:22,652
Rym: I got an A.

42
00:03:23,134 --> 00:03:23,956
Scott: That's really awesome.

43
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:27,165
Rym: Yeah, the professor was like I haven't seen any of you before.

44
00:03:27,747 --> 00:03:28,769
Rym: sure you're in the right class.

45
00:03:30,212 --> 00:03:32,950
Rym: He was this final Japanese guy, but he wasn't that interesting.

46
00:03:33,352 --> 00:03:37,849
Rym: Yeah, I don't know if it was because of the subject matter if he was just a boring guy, but never saw him again.

47
00:03:38,874 --> 00:03:41,704
Scott: if only I had a DS in those days.

48
00:03:41,725 --> 00:03:52,410
Rym: Oh Well When I had that laptop or that tablet PC, I was testing for the school I just took it to class and friggin red slash dot like I never really did anything.

49
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,280
Rym: I didn't pay attention any.

50
00:03:53,301 --> 00:03:54,090
Scott: that's I think is a good thing.

51
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:54,292
Scott: I didn't.

52
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:56,670
Scott: I didn't have a laptop in college because that's what I would have done.

53
00:03:56,831 --> 00:03:58,589
Scott: I wouldn't actually paid attention any class.

54
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:04,270
Rym: Yeah, a lot of our classes took place in labs with computers So I just be dicking around on the internet or doing homework for other classes.

55
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:08,206
Scott: It's great when they have a lab with rows and rows of computers facing the front.

56
00:04:08,226 --> 00:04:09,190
Scott: the teachers at the front.

57
00:04:09,271 --> 00:04:10,687
Scott: He can't see what's on any of the monitors.

58
00:04:10,727 --> 00:04:21,875
Scott: Yep Yep, and then you walk by and this wind is glass wall and you can see what everyone's doing And half the people are in aim and half the people are playing poker Man.

59
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:26,456
Rym: I miss those days so much Mmm, yeah, you know what?

60
00:04:26,496 --> 00:04:27,862
Scott: I laugh at them now because guess what?

61
00:04:27,902 --> 00:04:29,750
Scott: I got a degree despite all that fucking around.

62
00:04:30,072 --> 00:04:30,274
Rym: Yep.

63
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:30,556
Rym: Yep.

64
00:04:30,577 --> 00:04:33,500
Rym: We got degrees and jobs High-paying jobs.

65
00:04:33,843 --> 00:04:35,565
Rym: Yeah, we're adults.

66
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:37,994
Rym: Very it's kind of scary.

67
00:04:38,014 --> 00:04:42,128
Rym: I mean, I got my tax thing in the mail yesterday and it wasn't the 1040 easy.

68
00:04:43,192 --> 00:04:45,821
Rym: No, it was the 1040 a which is like the.

69
00:04:45,882 --> 00:04:47,708
Rym: you're an adult and you have to pay real taxes.

70
00:04:47,768 --> 00:04:50,236
Scott: form Mmm, I'm gonna have to do that.

71
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,024
Scott: I think I do it myself.

72
00:04:52,044 --> 00:04:53,210
Scott: I'm like a website somewhere.

73
00:04:53,532 --> 00:04:57,290
Rym: Yeah, I used to use H&R block just because it's free and it's easy.

74
00:04:57,792 --> 00:05:01,910
Rym: But I'm gonna do it myself because I got a lot of like weird deductions and I don't trust them.

75
00:05:02,251 --> 00:05:08,205
Scott: I'm either gonna use a website that I just fill it out for free or I'm gonna use the website where I pay a little Bit of money or something like that.

76
00:05:09,313 --> 00:05:10,117
Scott: It shouldn't be too bad.

77
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:12,429
Scott: Yeah better than mailing shit.

78
00:05:13,835 --> 00:05:17,396
Rym: so the DS Reached the 10 million mark.

79
00:05:18,138 --> 00:05:19,982
Scott: as in there are 10 million ds's.

80
00:05:20,724 --> 00:05:22,870
Rym: as then 10 million ds's have been sold.

81
00:05:23,211 --> 00:05:35,230
Rym: Now know what I say sold and not shifts because that's what Sony has this thing where Sony Will say how many PSP's were quote unquote sold, but they mean sold to retailers not sold to people.

82
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:41,450
Rym: Nintendo in the press release Specifically said 10 million ds's have been sold to people.

83
00:05:42,113 --> 00:05:43,219
Rym: We have shipped many more.

84
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:58,470
Scott: those 10 million are the ones that people bought Mm-hmm kind of a jab at Sony in their number faking Mmm, well, you know what it always happens that when you're winning the numbers game You always want to stick to the truth in the numbers game and do that.

85
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:04,310
Scott: But when you're losing the numbers game, you always want to you know, fudge it and then make up some talky-talk.

86
00:06:04,812 --> 00:06:07,969
Scott: I mean when Nintendo is losing the numbers game with the GameCube, they did the same thing.

87
00:06:08,595 --> 00:06:10,129
Scott: So it's it's just that's just how they play.

88
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:12,650
Scott: Yeah But it makes it easy to just you know.

89
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:19,074
Scott: You never know the exact number unless someone goes and finds it out with a lot of money and research to you know Do the real stuff.

90
00:06:19,175 --> 00:06:22,750
Scott: but it just lets you know, who's winning is the people who are going?

91
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,307
Scott: These are the real numbers of the winners.

92
00:06:26,111 --> 00:06:28,458
Rym: So DS winning yeah, and you know what.

93
00:06:28,578 --> 00:06:32,650
Rym: there I think I see all the reasons why it's finally all come into clarity.

94
00:06:33,332 --> 00:06:39,793
Rym: For one I noticed that all the old guys in my office who like don't even know who Mario is and I have no idea About video games.

95
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:53,123
Rym: They all got their kids ds's and Nintendogs or things like that like Animal Crossing for Christmas and They had no idea how the Nintendo Wi-Fi worked and I had to spend like 10 minutes today explaining to them what it was And how to use it.

96
00:06:54,092 --> 00:06:55,116
Rym: They just like didn't get it.

97
00:06:55,257 --> 00:06:58,190
Scott: Nintendo did everything that possibly could to make it easy for people.

98
00:06:58,311 --> 00:07:02,030
Scott: Well, I don't know why they don't just sell the Wi-Fi things to people like in the store.

99
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:03,890
Scott: Like if you want it you have to kind of get it online.

100
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,404
Scott: Yeah.

101
00:07:05,232 --> 00:07:13,319
Rym: But they were amazed when I showed him Nintendo Wi-Fi calm and they discovered that Wow every McDonald's Everywhere just about has a Wi-Fi.

102
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:13,921
Rym: Mm-hmm.

103
00:07:14,504 --> 00:07:15,287
Rym: They were like, how do they?

104
00:07:15,347 --> 00:07:16,130
Rym: why would they do that?

105
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,374
Rym: It's not that popular is it?

106
00:07:17,434 --> 00:07:21,808
Rym: and I was like, well one it's super popular and two.

107
00:07:21,868 --> 00:07:26,495
Rym: Yeah Yeah, shut up I Mean having free Wi-Fi.

108
00:07:26,515 --> 00:07:28,260
Scott: the McDonald's just keeps fat people.

109
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,330
Scott: another reason to keep sitting there to maybe get another burger.

110
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:38,568
Rym: well, a lot of people around here don't have broadband like Surprisingly a lot of people considering how close we are to New York City.

111
00:07:39,131 --> 00:07:45,897
Rym: Mmm, I mean either it's not available or they just don't see a need and a lot of them are paying a lot of money For really crappy dial-up.

112
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:46,379
Scott: Yeah.

113
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,846
Scott: I don't know why anyone used dial-up anymore.

114
00:07:47,907 --> 00:07:48,429
Scott: Just don't get it.

115
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,236
Rym: Actually, my dad just got dial-up.

116
00:07:50,497 --> 00:07:51,180
Scott: He just got it.

117
00:07:51,662 --> 00:07:52,746
Rym: It's $8 a month.

118
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:53,810
Scott: That's not so bad.

119
00:07:53,991 --> 00:07:56,784
Rym: Yeah, considering all he does is surf the web a little and check his email.

120
00:07:57,165 --> 00:07:58,190
Scott: No, I mean just check an email.

121
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:58,633
Scott: What though?

122
00:07:58,874 --> 00:08:04,521
Rym: Yeah, cuz the cable company out there was raping him Mmm, even with the discount for having cable TV.

123
00:08:04,762 --> 00:08:06,930
Scott: I've heard of DSL people raping but not cable.

124
00:08:07,652 --> 00:08:10,510
Rym: Yeah, the cable people here are raping us a little compared to what we should be paying.

125
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:15,490
Scott: Yeah, but that can be expected because we're trying to screw their business model, you know, it's yeah.

126
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,209
Scott: At least it works and it's fast.

127
00:08:19,092 --> 00:08:27,446
Rym: Though the other factor aside from you know little kiddies playing in ten dogs That we really really found out and we really really pushed to the max.

128
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:28,410
Rym: at our New Year's party.

129
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:30,710
Rym: We had eight people and eight DS's.

130
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:46,513
Rym: Let me tell you eight person bomber man where Every single person in the game is a real live person who's sitting next to you and punching you in the arm after you blow Them up is one of the most fantastic experiences a man can have Mm-hmm.

131
00:08:46,754 --> 00:08:52,090
Scott: I mean it's pretty amazing back in the day when you had like four game boys with that wire thing.

132
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:55,241
Rym: Yeah, those stupid wires you're huddled like in a corner all together.

133
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:56,044
Rym: You can barely move.

134
00:08:56,084 --> 00:09:04,692
Scott: someone pops their cable out in the game's over Yeah, but like while it worked, you know, it was the greatest thing, but there was just frustration like Overhead.

135
00:09:05,115 --> 00:09:09,930
Rym: this is that times a million like we're at seven I remove all the frustration overhead and you double the fun.

136
00:09:10,211 --> 00:09:11,780
Rym: We're running around blowing each other up.

137
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:13,630
Rym: one person like gets up to go to the bathroom.

138
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,521
Rym: They just bring the DS in there with him and keep playing because it's wireless.

139
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:21,909
Rym: Oh, yeah, and Eight player Mario Kart pretty much defines that game.

140
00:09:23,492 --> 00:09:34,363
Rym: I mean if you've not if you don't have seven friends with DS's kill some hobos and Reanimate their corpses as zombies and then give them DS's and teach them how to play and then race against them Why just give the hobos DS's?

141
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,296
Rym: They're hobos.

142
00:09:38,457 --> 00:09:42,964
Rym: what you rather have a zombie than a hobo Zombie is better is tomorrow is tomorrow.

143
00:09:43,647 --> 00:09:45,030
Scott: All right Yeah.

144
00:09:45,893 --> 00:09:50,830
Rym: So the DS wins and the sales are actually split pretty much 50/50 between the US and Japan.

145
00:09:51,311 --> 00:09:52,656
Rym: Japan has like 1 million more.

146
00:09:52,716 --> 00:09:58,281
Rym: it's like 5 million Japan 4 million US and then like one in every other country They have a percentage.

147
00:09:58,321 --> 00:10:01,683
Scott: wise that's not so good If you look at the number of people total in US.

148
00:10:01,723 --> 00:10:04,897
Scott: first total in Japan That's like many many.

149
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:10,056
Scott: a big percent of Japanese people are DSN and many many small Percent of US people are DSN.

150
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:11,522
Rym: a lot of people have pointed out that.

151
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,630
Rym: one reason for that is that in Japan?

152
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,495
Rym: There's one more gamer market.

153
00:10:15,555 --> 00:10:17,040
Rym: that games have come out for that.

154
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,063
Rym: Haven't hit the US yet?

155
00:10:18,725 --> 00:10:22,103
Rym: those train your brain games I just don't understand.

156
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:29,250
Scott: I mean Nine, there are some games that are very difficult to bring across to other countries and that's understandable.

157
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:44,007
Scott: I mean if you make a game about learning the Japanese language or a game about learning English and it's all in Japanese or very very text heavy games You know where there's like actual writing of text like a Tokimeki thing where it actually read.

158
00:10:44,047 --> 00:10:50,695
Scott: they have a huge Very powerful complex system of reading Japanese words out loud Text-to-speech.

159
00:10:51,277 --> 00:10:54,630
Scott: I can understand not bringing that thing over directly because it's very difficult.

160
00:10:55,652 --> 00:11:02,536
Scott: But there's no reason you can't bring something over like they still haven't brought over Shonen jump The fighting game.

161
00:11:02,717 --> 00:11:05,265
Rym: Yeah, even though every fanboy in the world imported it.

162
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:07,694
Scott: Yeah, I know it's like Why.

163
00:11:07,936 --> 00:11:18,890
Scott: it would take me maybe maybe a few weeks if I had a kit to translate the game if I had also had a translator with me and Put it out in the US.

164
00:11:19,834 --> 00:11:20,467
Scott: What the hell?

165
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:28,870
Scott: Just even if you want to delay it like a little bit put it out in the US Three weeks later put it out in the US a month later.

166
00:11:29,332 --> 00:11:30,998
Scott: It's been like months and months and months and months.

167
00:11:31,018 --> 00:11:31,922
Scott: what the hell's wrong with you.

168
00:11:32,243 --> 00:11:37,483
Scott: There's no reason not to release Every single game you can and every single market you can.

169
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:42,642
Scott: you know, if you have to I Remember when they released Katamari in the US.

170
00:11:43,023 --> 00:11:47,529
Scott: they didn't know it was gonna be huge But someone must have pushed for the release to happen.

171
00:11:48,612 --> 00:11:51,430
Scott: That's why every store sold out because they didn't know is gonna be a big game.

172
00:11:51,611 --> 00:12:03,508
Rym: They just bought like it like two copies in each store or whatever and then also that See they should do what the anime companies do and just go to gamer conventions anime conventions and just look at what kids are talking about and then import those games.

173
00:12:03,528 --> 00:12:12,501
Scott: and Or what they should do is like the game stops and the EBS should import games like or at least offer a game import service like.

174
00:12:12,521 --> 00:12:19,281
Scott: here's a list of games that you can import for like 20 bucks more than The normal price and then see which games get imported.

175
00:12:19,702 --> 00:12:26,647
Scott: and as soon as a game gets imported like a single store Like two or three times it's time to you know, get that game over here.

176
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:30,237
Rym: Yeah Pronto but these train your brain games.

177
00:12:30,638 --> 00:12:34,850
Rym: they hit this demographic of gamer that has not yet been touched in the u.s.

178
00:12:35,594 --> 00:12:38,390
Rym: It's older people who want mental stimulation.

179
00:12:38,852 --> 00:12:43,750
Rym: It's basically the same market as people who like really get into crossword puzzles or like Sudoku.

180
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,517
Scott: I don't know what's up with this Sudoku thing.

181
00:12:45,537 --> 00:12:47,224
Rym: God a guy work out like.

182
00:12:47,244 --> 00:12:48,790
Rym: really he discovered and got really into it.

183
00:12:49,057 --> 00:12:49,348
Scott: You know what?

184
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,836
Scott: It looks to me like I didn't.

185
00:12:52,097 --> 00:12:59,250
Scott: I've seen Sudoku before in my life and I knew about the puzzle and I always thought it Was a dumb puzzle because a computer can solve it in about two seconds.

186
00:12:59,531 --> 00:13:05,958
Rym: It's the same as minesweeper you sit there and it's a task that you can miss repetitive and once you learn the pattern It's just a matter of iterating it.

187
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:06,581
Scott: Yep.

188
00:13:06,601 --> 00:13:08,030
Scott: There's no actual thinking involved.

189
00:13:08,131 --> 00:13:11,290
Scott: It's just you know, once you know how to find the solution.

190
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:18,810
Scott: You're just performing an algorithm that the computer can perform and it's not really like a strategy or a complex thought or anything.

191
00:13:19,654 --> 00:13:22,168
Scott: but anyway enough about the game itself.

192
00:13:22,188 --> 00:13:31,764
Scott: I Saw it a long time ago because I used to get all those little game magazines, you know for stuff to do unlike trains and stuff and planes or long trips in the car.

193
00:13:32,869 --> 00:13:35,581
Scott: and Sudoku is one of the puzzles that was thrown in.

194
00:13:35,622 --> 00:13:37,310
Scott: it wasn't any different from any other ones.

195
00:13:38,136 --> 00:13:42,334
Scott: I usually didn't do it because it was boring but It's like.

196
00:13:42,434 --> 00:13:46,469
Scott: all of a sudden I started seeing these things like Sudoku's the latest craze.

197
00:13:47,214 --> 00:13:54,526
Scott: And then right after I heard Sudoku was the latest craze I saw books and I saw like pages and newspapers and it was all over the place.

198
00:13:54,586 --> 00:13:59,013
Scott: and I'm thinking to myself I didn't see it being a craze Before.

199
00:13:59,655 --> 00:14:02,484
Scott: I see it being a craze now, I think is a manufactured craze.

200
00:14:02,724 --> 00:14:03,427
Rym: I could see that.

201
00:14:03,607 --> 00:14:07,102
Scott: I could really see that I really think Sudoku is a manufactured craze.

202
00:14:07,444 --> 00:14:08,710
Scott: No one was interested in Sudoku.

203
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:17,362
Scott: It was just some other dumb puzzle just like all those other dumb types of puzzles, but I think someone said hey We can make books out of this and make a lot of money.

204
00:14:17,864 --> 00:14:26,470
Scott: Let's do some PR Make everyone think it's a craze and then put out books right before the holiday season and put it in newspapers and it worked.

205
00:14:27,085 --> 00:14:27,269
Rym: Yeah.

206
00:14:27,732 --> 00:14:33,653
Scott: So if they can man your if I want to find out who manufacture if it is indeed manufactured because I think it is I'm 90% sure.

207
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:39,810
Scott: I want to find out who manufactured the Sudoku craze and have the manufacture crazes about all sorts of nerdy things.

208
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,166
Scott: I like to make them popular and cheap.

209
00:14:42,292 --> 00:14:48,485
Rym: but moving on in slightly less Video game related news because you could consider voting a video game.

210
00:14:48,525 --> 00:14:51,329
Rym: I guess it's just a really boring video game and the end always sucks.

211
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,001
Rym: Wisconsin did something awesome.

212
00:14:54,485 --> 00:14:57,478
Rym: land of cheese Basically, they have.

213
00:14:57,518 --> 00:14:59,850
Rym: well they did a little while ago and you might have heard of it.

214
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:06,313
Rym: But today the governor signed it into law and this law states that one Anytime.

215
00:15:06,353 --> 00:15:08,541
Rym: an electronic voting machine is used in Wisconsin.

216
00:15:09,063 --> 00:15:10,287
Rym: It must be fully 100% open source.

217
00:15:12,271 --> 00:15:15,343
Rym: That's good - there must be a paper trail.

218
00:15:15,684 --> 00:15:22,430
Rym: that is both untamperable Like you can't tamper with it and you can visually verify your own vote before you leave the booth.

219
00:15:23,477 --> 00:15:24,027
Scott: That's good, too.

220
00:15:24,651 --> 00:15:30,810
Rym: It's pretty much exactly what anyone who's smart has been advocating for the last forever should be a federal law.

221
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:33,466
Rym: Yeah, well, Wisconsin did it die.

222
00:15:33,486 --> 00:15:37,321
Rym: bold is very pissed He'll d bold.

223
00:15:38,006 --> 00:15:45,330
Scott: Yeah, well Their choices are not sell voting machines to Wisconsin or make voting machines that don't suck.

224
00:15:46,053 --> 00:15:47,961
Scott: Yeah, see the thing is is this great?

225
00:15:48,022 --> 00:15:56,870
Scott: because you know normally Devold could technically get away with giving good voting machines to Wisconsin and bad voting machines to everyone else, right?

226
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:04,370
Scott: But it's not profitable for them to make multiple different kinds of voting machines, especially just for one exception.

227
00:16:05,092 --> 00:16:17,710
Scott: so either they can just give up on Wisconsin and lose that money which they probably will do and someone else will fill the void or They'll just make all of them the Wisconsin way and then you know sell the same machine to everyone.

228
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,970
Scott: But then is the problem of states might not actually use the paper trail.

229
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,541
Scott: They just might not put any receipts in it or whatever, you know, who knows?

230
00:16:24,581 --> 00:16:25,987
Rym: Well, this law says you have to.

231
00:16:26,007 --> 00:16:29,039
Scott: oh, yeah But I'm that's it only in Wisconsin.

232
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:37,009
Rym: Yeah, so even though even then if it's open source It's a lot harder to screw with it because if there's a back door some geek will see it and say hey, why is that there?

233
00:16:37,773 --> 00:16:41,470
Scott: Well, I don't think that debolds about to release any source that incriminates them.

234
00:16:41,831 --> 00:16:44,543
Rym: No, cuz honestly not to be sound like anything.

235
00:16:44,563 --> 00:16:46,250
Scott: do that'll be the most Larry's thing ever?

236
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:53,860
Rym: I mean I'm not saying that debold through the elections or anything like that because there's really no way to know even though there's a lot of Circumstantial evidence.

237
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,730
Scott: Yeah, a whole lot.

238
00:16:54,750 --> 00:17:04,009
Rym: The thing is there's too much circumstantial evidence that even if they didn't affect this election They set themselves up to be able to affect an election that is not in dispute.

239
00:17:04,896 --> 00:17:11,872
Rym: There are obvious Easily exploited back doors that just alter the vote count and then cover the tracks Like.

240
00:17:11,912 --> 00:17:12,614
Rym: that's not cool.

241
00:17:13,136 --> 00:17:13,878
Scott: Not cool at all.

242
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:21,690
Rym: So we don't know if they ever did it or not, but they obviously could have Mm-hmm, and I don't think they're going to open up their source because that would incriminate them.

243
00:17:22,132 --> 00:17:25,390
Rym: So if they want to sell voting machines in Wisconsin, they're gonna have to start from scratch.

244
00:17:25,893 --> 00:17:29,010
Scott: I think what probably gonna end up happening is it's constantly some other voting machine.

245
00:17:29,532 --> 00:17:32,263
Rym: Yeah, or they'll go back to you know, non-electronic voting.

246
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:33,990
Scott: I like non-electronic voting.

247
00:17:34,532 --> 00:17:35,598
Rym: I like it in some ways.

248
00:17:35,618 --> 00:17:36,866
Rym: I don't like it in other ways.

249
00:17:36,886 --> 00:17:37,530
Rym: What's wrong?

250
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:42,846
Scott: Well, I don't like writing writing on a physical ballot and I don't like the hole punching.

251
00:17:43,007 --> 00:17:43,970
Scott: I like the clicky machine.

252
00:17:44,051 --> 00:17:44,655
Rym: Well, here's the thing.

253
00:17:44,776 --> 00:17:48,575
Rym: even the clicky machines are bad because they don't always Work perfectly.

254
00:17:48,595 --> 00:17:49,479
Rym: and then you have to.

255
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,429
Rym: you have to figure out what to do with the broken ballots.

256
00:17:52,652 --> 00:17:55,831
Rym: Remember the hanging chads in 2000?

257
00:17:55,831 --> 00:17:57,134
Scott: Yeah, that's the hole punching.

258
00:17:57,474 --> 00:17:59,659
Rym: Yeah, but all voting machines have issues like that.

259
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:08,795
Scott: I Yeah, they when you it's like there's odometers in the back Just like in your car.

260
00:18:08,815 --> 00:18:09,939
Scott: has you know the odometer?

261
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,697
Scott: and when you vote the odometers go tick tick tick tick tick And they count up one.

262
00:18:15,018 --> 00:18:17,270
Scott: it pretty much works unless the machine is broken.

263
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:21,481
Rym: Yeah, and you know machines often break because they're not very well maintained.

264
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:22,564
Rym: They're not used often.

265
00:18:22,745 --> 00:18:24,670
Rym: No one really knows much about them.

266
00:18:24,931 --> 00:18:27,042
Rym: Yep, but I mean look at look at go to when you vote.

267
00:18:27,102 --> 00:18:28,409
Rym: look at the people running the election.

268
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,170
Rym: People don't have jobs or crazy people.

269
00:18:31,296 --> 00:18:38,029
Scott: Yeah but they do test all the machines before they use them to buy Voting on them and then looking in the back to see what the numbers are.

270
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:43,934
Scott: yeah, and then you know if that checks out then it checks out and They you know.

271
00:18:43,995 --> 00:18:52,087
Scott: if it's broken then usually what happens is when you pull the lever It won't pull or it won't ding or when you try to click certain switches down.

272
00:18:52,148 --> 00:18:52,770
Scott: They won't click.

273
00:18:53,051 --> 00:18:54,198
Scott: That's how you know, it's broken.

274
00:18:54,278 --> 00:18:58,708
Rym: Yeah, usually but the thing is if one does break There's really no way to get the votes back.

275
00:18:59,912 --> 00:19:03,870
Scott: Well, you know audit trail Let's say a hundred people vote and then it breaks.

276
00:19:04,412 --> 00:19:08,668
Scott: You open it up you write down the votes and then you use another machine or you just start using paper ballots.

277
00:19:08,788 --> 00:19:10,841
Rym: if you can Write down the votes depends on how it breaks.

278
00:19:11,082 --> 00:19:15,283
Scott: Well, there's an odometer in the back So the voting person opens it up and writes what says down there.

279
00:19:15,463 --> 00:19:16,146
Rym: Yeah, what if we just start?

280
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:16,950
Rym: what is it spins wrong?

281
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,509
Rym: What if one of the gears is screwed up and spinning backwards?

282
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:22,588
Scott: I I don't know if that could happen.

283
00:19:23,051 --> 00:19:29,191
Rym: It's I'm just saying the fact the fact that there's only one method there needs to be and and some sort of checksum some sort Of.

284
00:19:29,432 --> 00:19:32,384
Rym: there are two parallels separate methods of counting the vote.

285
00:19:33,107 --> 00:19:45,369
Scott: Hmm Usually what happens though is if the mechanical machines break they use paper ballots, but you can't really have two Ways of voting without having people vote twice on two different things.

286
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:47,498
Rym: You know, well you can.

287
00:19:47,518 --> 00:19:49,590
Rym: to Wisconsin you vote on one touchscreen.

288
00:19:50,015 --> 00:20:00,745
Rym: it prints out a Verifiable like name of the candidate you voted for behind glass on a receipt that then goes into a big Pile of receipts in a sealed box and it also counts electronically.

289
00:20:00,765 --> 00:20:02,975
Scott: Hmm I guess.

290
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,310
Scott: but what if like, you know, it has to display the receipt to you, right?

291
00:20:06,434 --> 00:20:06,667
Rym: Yeah

292
00:20:06,911 --> 00:20:17,188
Scott: so there'll be like a little piece of glass and the piece of paper will show up under the glass and you'll look at To make sure it's right and then if you like say no it goes in like a trash bin and you say yes It goes in the voting bin.

293
00:20:18,591 --> 00:20:23,187
Scott: What if like there's actually an hidden receipt under that one and that one goes in the bin too.

294
00:20:23,528 --> 00:20:24,130
Scott: that you couldn't you know?

295
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,870
Scott: You couldn't see it down there or something like that.

296
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:31,049
Rym: If you set up see it's a lot harder to fool people with mechanical things than it is to fool them with electronic things.

297
00:20:32,051 --> 00:20:35,750
Rym: It's real easy to just not do what the screen says in electronic thing.

298
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:46,702
Rym: It's real hard to make a complex device because remember one It'll be open source so people can just look - it'd be pretty obvious if such a complex mechanism to cheat was actually in there.

299
00:20:46,723 --> 00:20:47,946
Rym: That's true.

300
00:20:47,986 --> 00:20:59,290
Scott: But however open source could still fool people because let's say you know There's the motor control code that controls the motors and makes them spin and makes the machine do its physical printing thing.

301
00:21:00,254 --> 00:21:06,463
Scott: If you don't actually have the machine and the code together Looking at just the code like on the internet won't tell you that.

302
00:21:06,523 --> 00:21:12,948
Scott: hey that makes the machine Spin like extra votes down into the machine on paper or something, you know?

303
00:21:14,271 --> 00:21:15,197
Scott: Or even that.

304
00:21:15,237 --> 00:21:17,170
Scott: let's say you use a barcode on all the paper.

305
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:20,101
Scott: What if the barcodes don't match what the words say?

306
00:21:20,523 --> 00:21:22,250
Scott: so it might say voting for Joe blow.

307
00:21:22,691 --> 00:21:28,150
Scott: But the barcodes are all the same on every single one of them and they use the barcodes and the paper recount because they're lazy.

308
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:34,409
Rym: The thing is frauds like that are much more difficult to perpetrate Because they're much more easily noticed.

309
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:36,250
Rym: That's the whole point here.

310
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:41,722
Rym: It's not to make fraud impossible It's to make it difficult because the more difficult is the more likely.

311
00:21:41,742 --> 00:21:43,006
Rym: if someone tries it they get caught.

312
00:21:43,668 --> 00:21:45,601
Rym: and if you get caught Rigging a vote.

313
00:21:45,702 --> 00:21:46,328
Rym: That's the end.

314
00:21:47,214 --> 00:21:49,747
Scott: What is the penalty for vote rigging like?

315
00:21:49,787 --> 00:21:50,250
Rym: no idea?

316
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:51,032
Rym: Like I don't.

317
00:21:51,053 --> 00:21:51,697
Rym: it doesn't matter.

318
00:21:51,717 --> 00:21:53,469
Rym: the legal penalty doesn't matter at all.

319
00:21:53,971 --> 00:21:59,570
Rym: If if a presidential candidate were actually caught cheating that they're done isn't it?

320
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,502
Scott: I don't think any presidential candidate actually cheats.

321
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:02,749
Scott: I think people cheat for them.

322
00:22:02,971 --> 00:22:05,320
Scott: Oh, yeah, and then the question is didn't you know?

323
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:07,950
Scott: should the president be responsible if someone cheats for them?

324
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,519
Scott: Because if that's true, then I'll know the other guy.

325
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,950
Rym: I found out Nixon didn't break into the Watergate Hotel.

326
00:22:13,871 --> 00:22:15,477
Rym: Some guys just broke in for it.

327
00:22:15,497 --> 00:22:19,354
Rym: Yeah, but he told them to yeah, you can't prove that a hundred percent It's true.

328
00:22:19,374 --> 00:22:20,703
Scott: But what if I go down?

329
00:22:20,764 --> 00:22:37,030
Scott: Let's say I I join the election volunteers and beacon right and the next presidential election is a verse B and I'm gonna vote for a. I like a but I Cheat in the election to boost B and then people blame B and say B's a cheater.

330
00:22:37,151 --> 00:22:38,619
Scott: well, that works out well for me, doesn't it?

331
00:22:39,202 --> 00:22:43,942
Rym: Well, they have to catch you first and Otherwise, it's just it'll but one it wouldn't even matter.

332
00:22:44,103 --> 00:22:45,570
Rym: things like that generally don't get reported.

333
00:22:45,872 --> 00:22:46,880
Scott: I know that's I mean.

334
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:54,089
Rym: in the 2004 election There were a lot of scandals all over the place that hit the mainstream news and then disappeared and no one talked about him again.

335
00:22:54,612 --> 00:23:06,195
Rym: Yeah, and in a lot of recent elections in Chicago And it wasn't I'm not just single in Republicans both Republicans and Democrats had a lot of people vote for them who happen to have Died long before the election.

336
00:23:06,355 --> 00:23:06,536
Rym: dead.

337
00:23:06,556 --> 00:23:07,759
Scott: people vote in every election.

338
00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:09,364
Rym: Yeah, and you know what that shouldn't be.

339
00:23:09,384 --> 00:23:10,708
Scott: it definitely shouldn't be.

340
00:23:10,788 --> 00:23:11,329
Scott: I don't know how.

341
00:23:12,211 --> 00:23:13,297
Scott: They didn't even check my ID.

342
00:23:13,337 --> 00:23:14,402
Scott: I just registered to vote.

343
00:23:14,523 --> 00:23:14,885
Scott: I came in.

344
00:23:14,905 --> 00:23:15,548
Scott: I said who I wasn't.

345
00:23:15,568 --> 00:23:15,910
Scott: I voted.

346
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:16,998
Rym: Yeah, they didn't.

347
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:18,690
Rym: they didn't want me to verify anything.

348
00:23:19,192 --> 00:23:22,485
Rym: They showed me my name and then they asked is that your address?

349
00:23:22,686 --> 00:23:25,701
Scott: and I said, yes Even asked me if that was my address or anything.

350
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:27,168
Rym: and then I signed a scribble.

351
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,474
Rym: I saw the pencil.

352
00:23:28,494 --> 00:23:29,237
Rym: they didn't have a pen.

353
00:23:29,257 --> 00:23:30,000
Rym: They had a pencil.

354
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,589
Rym: Yeah, and I was like, can I have a pen?

355
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,676
Rym: They're like, why would you want a pen?

356
00:23:34,696 --> 00:23:36,830
Rym: I was like, so no one can erase my signature and vote again.

357
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,014
Rym: Mmm, and they were like what?

358
00:23:40,314 --> 00:23:41,818
Rym: because they were there was like these two old ladies.

359
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:44,043
Rym: They were like a hundred thousand years old.

360
00:23:44,064 --> 00:23:53,685
Scott: Nah, I Think the thing is is that they want so much freedom of voting and that if you want security of voting you're gonna need to Reduce freedom of voting.

361
00:23:53,705 --> 00:24:04,550
Scott: and You know while I'm all for freedom, I think voting right now is a little tiny bit too free Like a tiny bit like you can just walk in and click no matter what.

362
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,743
Scott: Yeah, that means you can go in and click twice.

363
00:24:07,763 --> 00:24:09,110
Scott: You can go and click in different places.

364
00:24:09,251 --> 00:24:09,795
Scott: You can go, you

365
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:23,910
Rym: know, plus like if I was an election worker I mean when I went I voted kind of late in the day and In this most recent election the election that almost no one voted in And one they I asked like so many people voted today and they're like no one was gonna come after me.

366
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:29,266
Rym: It was obvious and like 200 people out of the like 6,000 person little voting district.

367
00:24:29,366 --> 00:24:32,355
Rym: I'm in had actually voted Mmm, it was kind of sad.

368
00:24:32,756 --> 00:24:33,980
Scott: Well, that was a local election.

369
00:24:34,783 --> 00:24:35,024
Rym: Yeah.

370
00:24:35,204 --> 00:24:36,227
Rym: Well, no it was the.

371
00:24:36,348 --> 00:24:39,480
Rym: it was Election Day Yeah, but it was there just there just didn't.

372
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,050
Rym: there was only there were two state issues.

373
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:41,633
Rym: We voted on.

374
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:43,803
Scott: yeah, but compare that to a presidential election.

375
00:24:43,884 --> 00:24:47,819
Rym: like a thousand of people come out Even in a presidential election only about half the people vote.

376
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:51,230
Scott: if that yep, but people don't really care about all right.

377
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,502
Rym: So there's two election workers in the whole place.

378
00:24:54,307 --> 00:25:00,473
Rym: at this point It'd be real easy for them to just put scribbles on the names of all the people who haven't come in and then put their Votes in forum.

379
00:25:01,095 --> 00:25:02,019
Rym: Yeah, there's no way to know.

380
00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:02,962
Rym: There's no way to stop it.

381
00:25:03,605 --> 00:25:03,846
Scott: Yep.

382
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:05,790
Rym: I Don't know what to do about that.

383
00:25:05,831 --> 00:25:14,309
Rym: I just don't trust people and Rightfully so because I can think of how many ways I could gain the system if I wanted to and I know there are people Who are smarter than me with fewer scruples?

384
00:25:14,872 --> 00:25:15,132
Rym: Mm-hmm.

385
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:19,807
Scott: All we need I'm telling you we need to reduce no matter how distasteful it is.

386
00:25:19,827 --> 00:25:32,510
Scott: We need to reduce Freedom of voting because it's too free to introduce some Guarantees of voting because if you can't guarantee voting then democracy really just doesn't even matter, you know.

387
00:25:39,682 --> 00:25:51,140
Rym: so my thing of the day may not be the newest thing, but it's new to me and I hope it's new to you because it's hilarious and The payoff was much greater than I expected when I first started watching it.

388
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,665
Scott: I have no idea how new it is.

389
00:25:52,805 --> 00:25:58,581
Scott: But when I haven't seen it until just just recently which means Wow Yeah, we watched it we.

390
00:25:58,762 --> 00:26:11,000
Rym: one of the things we did our New Year's party when we were bored is we have the computer hooked up to the TV downstairs and We were just sitting around taking turns showing everyone else funny things on the internet and always a great thing on the internet.

391
00:26:12,343 --> 00:26:17,135
Rym: but this particular thing is the ultimate showdown and That really says it all.

392
00:26:17,155 --> 00:26:17,175
Rym: I

393
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:31,359
Scott: Always love those, you know, I'm not a fan of fanfiction but a lot of fanfiction is just like showdowns between guys or You know people from different universes or different stories like getting together

394
00:26:31,983 --> 00:26:35,582
Rym: Yeah, getting together in a BL kind of way Yeah,

395
00:26:35,642 --> 00:26:40,200
Scott: but you know the ultimate showdown is pretty much everyone from everything getting together and just great.

396
00:26:40,782 --> 00:26:50,715
Rym: Yeah, any any nerd loves that action and I'll warn you the tune is a little catchy and it might get stuck in your head But eventually it'll get annoying and you'll not want to hear it anymore.

397
00:26:51,217 --> 00:26:53,627
Scott: Yeah It's one of those types of songs.

398
00:26:54,088 --> 00:26:55,172
Rym: It's definitely worth seeing.

399
00:26:55,273 --> 00:26:57,220
Rym: I laughed my ass off, but I was a little drunk.

400
00:26:57,502 --> 00:26:59,460
Scott: I have a feeling that it's at least is new.

401
00:26:59,621 --> 00:27:09,620
Rym: It's newer than the Chuck Norris page because it has Chuck Norris in it true Though the Chuck Norris page just came out of a joke on Conan O'Brien show if I recall correctly.

402
00:27:10,481 --> 00:27:12,865
Scott: So then this must be newer than that joke, at least.

403
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:13,325
Rym: Yep.

404
00:27:14,207 --> 00:27:16,310
Scott: All right, so my thing of the day.

405
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:19,554
Scott: well You ever use MAME the arcade emulator?

406
00:27:19,575 --> 00:27:45,420
Scott: Yeah Yeah, well, there are a lot of people out there who use MAME apparently and have all sorts of ROMs for it and everything And I used to have some but anyway apparently the practice of making MAME Machines as in constructing arcade cabinets to run MAME on them or Taking arcade cabinets and replacing the insides with a computer that runs MAME is a lot more common than I previously believed.

407
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:46,199
Rym: Oh, really?

408
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:58,494
Scott: Yeah, like so common that this one guy made an entire webpage displaying pictures of MAME machines that he thought were crappy and explaining why they're crappy

409
00:27:58,975 --> 00:28:04,247
Rym: and explaining why they're why they're crappy in a Very funny and eloquent way I might add

410
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:08,540
Scott: a ranting hilarious sort of internet funny guy kind of way.

411
00:28:08,621 --> 00:28:09,088
Rym: Yeah, I remember.

412
00:28:09,169 --> 00:28:12,265
Scott: Hey crackhead Yeah, exactly the same type of thing.

413
00:28:12,746 --> 00:28:15,092
Scott: and just to show that he's not a complete idiot.

414
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:22,011
Scott: He has he displays one of his own MAME cabinets and he says yeah just to make sure I'm not an idiot.

415
00:28:22,091 --> 00:28:24,420
Scott: Here's one of my cabinets - look how ugly it is.

416
00:28:24,501 --> 00:28:25,415
Scott: I can't believe I did that.

417
00:28:26,061 --> 00:28:27,509
Rym: See, I mean some of them are like wow.

418
00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:29,620
Rym: someone tried to make something cool and it's not that cool.

419
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,062
Rym: Whatever.

420
00:28:30,464 --> 00:28:33,720
Rym: some of them are like wow, it's like you went out of your way to make something uncool.

421
00:28:34,522 --> 00:28:43,920
Scott: It's really just people trying to make one with the best of their Craftsmanship ability and not having so much ability or design sense or anything and just making something crappy.

422
00:28:44,961 --> 00:28:47,914
Rym: It's like when I tried to make my DDR hard pad.

423
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,802
Scott: Yeah exactly like that I mean.

424
00:28:49,822 --> 00:28:52,393
Rym: it turned out really well except that it didn't work.

425
00:28:53,015 --> 00:28:57,279
Rym: and then when I made it work It was ugly and I ended up just throwing it away.

426
00:28:58,161 --> 00:29:02,240
Rym: No, it was a good experience, yeah, I learned to not try to make a hard DDR pad.

427
00:29:02,802 --> 00:29:03,385
Scott: Here's the best.

428
00:29:03,485 --> 00:29:04,289
Scott: one is pretty short.

429
00:29:04,429 --> 00:29:06,860
Scott: It's a looks like a normal arcade cabinet.

430
00:29:07,462 --> 00:29:16,380
Scott: it's got sticks with six and buttons next to them and a start button for each player and There's a monitor in there and he has the the centipede marquee on it.

431
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:21,560
Scott: But the size of it all have that marble texture on them and he says marble.

432
00:29:21,821 --> 00:29:26,720
Scott: It's still awesome because he made fun of one previously for having a marble texture because they're all ugly.

433
00:29:27,761 --> 00:29:29,226
Scott: Then he says better yet.

434
00:29:29,366 --> 00:29:33,500
Scott: It's got a centipede marquee and he doesn't even have a goddamn trackball.

435
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:42,831
Rym: You know I should make a main cabinet and just only have one game in it Rampart and I'll have a freaking trackball three trackballs.

436
00:29:43,293 --> 00:29:45,200
Rym: It'll be cue balls from a billiard set.

437
00:29:47,281 --> 00:29:51,352
Rym: See I'm gonna get real Atari trackballs if I could find him see.

438
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:56,119
Rym: the only my gripe about the Atari trackballs Were that they weren't massive enough.

439
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,202
Scott: They're pretty massive.

440
00:29:58,283 --> 00:30:03,980
Rym: Yeah, they're more massive than those massive giant like cut off the tips of your fingers trackball.

441
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:07,350
Scott: I remember them being more massive than billiards balls.

442
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:10,580
Scott: So I don't know why you would want to use billiard balls instead.

443
00:30:13,071 --> 00:30:13,936
Scott: Maybe I'm Emma wrong.

444
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:15,182
Rym: I think you do.

445
00:30:15,664 --> 00:30:16,790
Rym: billiard balls are kind of massive.

446
00:30:17,031 --> 00:30:24,004
Scott: apparently what a lot of people do is they get the balls from You know those golden tea golf machines that are popular in bars.

447
00:30:24,064 --> 00:30:25,730
Rym: Those are the stupidest things ever.

448
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:28,730
Scott: They're pretty dumb, but they have that ball in them and that's an art.

449
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:38,989
Scott: that's a good arcade ball and a lot of people either get them from golden tea golf machines or They get them from the supplier who makes the golden tea golf machines, huh?

450
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,195
Scott: so that's where you can get.

451
00:30:40,316 --> 00:30:46,143
Scott: you can still get the balls for arcade machines nowadays and The thing is looking at a lot of these main cabinets.

452
00:30:46,505 --> 00:30:47,410
Scott: It's kind of scary.

453
00:30:48,174 --> 00:30:56,904
Scott: I think a lot of people are running golden tea golf on there because they have the balls Positioned right in the middle of the controls, but golden tea golf is a bad game.

454
00:30:56,925 --> 00:31:06,330
Scott: I know but I guess these people It's like some of them are obviously only playing certain games on their meme because they only have certain controls.

455
00:31:06,854 --> 00:31:08,750
Rym: Well, then there's that one guy who has every control.

456
00:31:09,102 --> 00:31:24,413
Scott: Yeah and there's a few people who have like every control scheme possible because obviously they're trying to play every type of game, you know, I It's not worth it.

457
00:31:29,211 --> 00:31:32,924
Rym: But anyway, it's anime day and we watched one new show.

458
00:31:33,104 --> 00:31:34,529
Rym: It's not that new but it's a movie.

459
00:31:34,609 --> 00:31:34,810
Scott: actually.

460
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:39,106
Rym: Yeah, it's a movie called kazayo mita shonen or the boy who saw the wind.

461
00:31:39,126 --> 00:31:42,355
Scott: I Like it a lot It's alright.

462
00:31:42,456 --> 00:31:42,978
Rym: I liked it.

463
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,910
Rym: It's it a lot of people think it's a Ghibli movie.

464
00:31:46,372 --> 00:31:56,025
Rym: In fact on nausicaa.net it's on the page of movies that are commonly mistaken for Ghibli movies And many VCD bootlegs of this movie have the studio Ghibli logo on them.

465
00:31:56,366 --> 00:31:59,136
Scott: when I first downloaded it it was pretty much just.

466
00:31:59,257 --> 00:32:07,652
Scott: I was on the anime ski and I saw a torrent for The boy who saw the wind Ghibli style movie and I said well, I never heard of this But I'll get it.

467
00:32:08,475 --> 00:32:08,937
Scott: and I got it.

468
00:32:09,338 --> 00:32:14,059
Scott: and we I watched it alone a long time ago and forgot most of it But we watched it all together again.

469
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:14,883
Scott: Just this weekend.

470
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:15,970
Rym: See it's alright.

471
00:32:16,332 --> 00:32:21,578
Rym: It's really pretty like it looks like it's just in a really old style But the style is really well done.

472
00:32:21,598 --> 00:32:22,381
Scott: I think it was done in 2000.

473
00:32:22,381 --> 00:32:26,036
Rym: It's RIT's not that old Yeah, but it looks a lot older than it is.

474
00:32:26,056 --> 00:32:29,590
Rym: Mm-hmm, and it's just the typical, you know, there's a boy.

475
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:30,472
Rym: He has a power.

476
00:32:30,934 --> 00:32:36,690
Rym: He goes on adventure to save people and it's good, but it's kind of simplistic.

477
00:32:37,671 --> 00:32:38,994
Rym: Like there's good guys.

478
00:32:39,355 --> 00:32:39,997
Rym: They're perfect.

479
00:32:40,238 --> 00:32:41,160
Rym: There's bad guys.

480
00:32:41,401 --> 00:32:43,466
Rym: They're absolutely silly Lee evil.

481
00:32:43,486 --> 00:32:45,694
Scott: Oh The bad guy.

482
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:46,076
Scott: Yeah.

483
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:48,568
Rym: Yeah, the bad guy is like imagine Hitler.

484
00:32:48,668 --> 00:32:54,433
Scott: only I think they could have made that a little better if they would have Added some.

485
00:32:55,014 --> 00:33:05,210
Scott: they they could have shown the the rebellion sometimes in a bad light like look they're killing people, too Yeah, but they always had the bad guys with those like masks on so that you know.

486
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:17,030
Scott: Then when they do that kind of thing if they would have humanized those guys in the masks a little bit more to make the Rebellion that seem you know, not perfect and great and if they would have had that evil scientist lady

487
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:19,150
Rym: Not turn insane Yeah

488
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:25,501
Scott: They should have actually like made her someone who is Nice and is like forced into evil.

489
00:33:25,521 --> 00:33:33,700
Scott: so you kind of like feel bad for instead of going out She's a crazy not get rid of which is what they seem to start doing right away And they just forget like alright, she's crazy.

490
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,050
Rym: They make her crazier than Ritsuko's mom from Ava.

491
00:33:36,811 --> 00:33:40,690
Scott: Yeah, every other anime seems to do it the way I just described this one was just like forget.

492
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,990
Scott: It's not worth the effort, but it was still good.

493
00:33:43,311 --> 00:33:43,652
Rym: It was just.

494
00:33:43,692 --> 00:33:44,755
Rym: it was really simplistic.

495
00:33:44,816 --> 00:33:55,282
Rym: like every time they needed to move the main character somewhere else for a change of scene or To move the plot along they'd have him fall from a great height Be knocked unconscious and wake up in a strange land.

496
00:33:55,342 --> 00:33:56,950
Scott: Yeah, they did that twice right at the beginning.

497
00:33:57,252 --> 00:33:58,116
Scott: Yeah, it was great.

498
00:33:58,317 --> 00:34:00,630
Rym: It happens a grand total of three freaking times.

499
00:34:02,191 --> 00:34:05,995
Rym: Yeah, they need Another way to move the plot.

500
00:34:06,015 --> 00:34:07,580
Scott: They didn't only hope or a trap.

501
00:34:08,161 --> 00:34:08,683
Rym: It's a trap.

502
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:10,810
Rym: Yep, but it's definitely worth watching.

503
00:34:11,193 --> 00:34:14,299
Rym: I mean I enjoyed it and There's a lot of good characters.

504
00:34:14,521 --> 00:34:15,649
Rym: It's real sad at points.

505
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:22,270
Rym: We can't ruin the end and I suggest you watch it because there is a twist that I didn't see coming.

506
00:34:23,091 --> 00:34:32,141
Scott: Yeah, I mean I'd seen it before and I forgot what happened at the end and then I was like, oh, right Not like the other ones where there's a twist that it was so strong.

507
00:34:32,183 --> 00:34:35,348
Scott: you remember it that way when you see it again You're like, ooh, it's gonna happen again.

508
00:34:36,551 --> 00:34:38,138
Rym: It's just a it's a it's a twist.

509
00:34:38,158 --> 00:34:38,900
Rym: You don't see coming.

510
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,945
Rym: That's really all I can say.

511
00:34:39,965 --> 00:34:43,206
Rym: I Did not expect the movie to end the way it did.

512
00:34:44,158 --> 00:34:44,808
Scott: It was a good ending.

513
00:34:45,237 --> 00:34:45,688
Scott: I don't think so.

514
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:46,091
Scott: I don't.

515
00:34:46,152 --> 00:34:52,152
Scott: I don't think there could have been a better ending for what they had already done in the show had the ending not Been the way it was.

516
00:34:52,292 --> 00:34:58,273
Rym: I probably would have written the show off because other than that it was just kind of a Typical predictable.

517
00:34:58,293 --> 00:34:59,457
Rym: see that was the worst thing.

518
00:34:59,517 --> 00:35:01,404
Rym: It was pretty much a hundred percent predictable.

519
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:05,058
Rym: watch other than the twist Every single thing that happens.

520
00:35:05,078 --> 00:35:07,189
Rym: you can predict from like the previous two things that happened.

521
00:35:08,034 --> 00:35:17,322
Rym: And as we as we were all watching the show because we watched it at the party We had everyone here and it was basically just everyone was yelling out Oh, obviously blah blah blah is gonna happen and then blah blah blah happens.

522
00:35:17,904 --> 00:35:20,736
Rym: It's like every time there's a happy scene There's a sad scene right after it.

523
00:35:20,776 --> 00:35:23,889
Rym: that pretty much is a direct thing that ruins whatever was happy.

524
00:35:24,611 --> 00:35:32,328
Scott: That's a problem though with all kinds of things these days is that when you've seen enough anime or you've seen enough movies or television over the course of your life.

525
00:35:33,171 --> 00:35:39,190
Scott: Everything gets predictable and you need to watch really complex or really weird stuff to find something that's not predictable.

526
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:44,788
Rym: Yep, you know thing is even they get predictable because the the unpredictability itself becomes predictable.

527
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:48,221
Scott: Yeah It's like oh, he's gonna do the opposite of what's normally gonna happen.

528
00:35:48,623 --> 00:35:49,527
Scott: So he's gonna do this.

529
00:35:49,768 --> 00:35:52,741
Rym: Oh, I got it, right Yep, like we started a while ago.

530
00:35:52,781 --> 00:35:54,550
Rym: We were watching like Hitchcock movies.

531
00:35:54,932 --> 00:35:58,489
Rym: We were watching the old Hitchcock movies like early in his career.

532
00:35:59,152 --> 00:36:02,183
Rym: Like they're they're good, but they're hard to watch.

533
00:36:02,263 --> 00:36:08,104
Scott: and oh like in the first one I figured out what was gonna happen like, you know, right before it happened at the end.

534
00:36:08,305 --> 00:36:14,519
Scott: Yep, but then later on I was like saying what was gonna happen like Like minutes and minutes before it happened.

535
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:19,930
Rym: cuz back then like it seems like the big thing with movies back Then was to put a twist at the end like every movie had a twist.

536
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,581
Scott: Well, no, that's not the big thing back then.

537
00:36:21,621 --> 00:36:27,890
Scott: That's Hitchcock's thing And I've seen a lot of other movies from that era of course, but Hitchcock is like the twist master.

538
00:36:28,392 --> 00:36:31,990
Rym: The problem was once you like start figuring out how the twists work.

539
00:36:32,392 --> 00:36:36,170
Rym: You always predict the twist because it's always just think what's the least likely thing to happen?

540
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,949
Rym: Well, that's obviously how the movies gonna end.

541
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,710
Scott: Well, it's not the least likely thing to happen.

542
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:44,410
Rym: The least likely thing to happen is something crazy the least likely thing to happen that is still possible to happen.

543
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:46,440
Scott: It's not really something that's least likely.

544
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,787
Scott: It's actually very likely.

545
00:36:47,887 --> 00:36:48,490
Scott: It's just unexpected.

546
00:36:50,113 --> 00:36:58,107
Scott: It's the thing that is most Unexpected to happen but still makes a whole lot of sense and is very exciting a lot of times though.

547
00:36:58,127 --> 00:36:58,970
Rym: They didn't make sense.

548
00:36:59,891 --> 00:37:01,917
Scott: Those are the bad Hitchcock movies that no one remembers.

549
00:37:02,078 --> 00:37:04,445
Rym: Yeah, like the one I don't remember which one it was.

550
00:37:04,726 --> 00:37:05,548
Rym: where they're?

551
00:37:05,588 --> 00:37:06,130
Rym: they're conflicted.

552
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:13,775
Rym: The bunch of characters are conflicted about killing someone and then they end up not even having to worry about it because a freaking bomb Blows up the train they're on and the guy dies.

553
00:37:13,835 --> 00:37:15,600
Scott: Anyway, yeah, that's just something crazy.

554
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:19,694
Scott: But like 39 steps is very make sense You know.

555
00:37:19,814 --> 00:37:21,039
Scott: and and me?

556
00:37:21,341 --> 00:37:23,570
Rym: yeah, yeah, they're also highly predictable.

557
00:37:24,632 --> 00:37:34,342
Scott: some of it was highly predictable, but it's one of those things where You can predict it if you remember everything that happened in the movie Because the twist is something that you forgot.

558
00:37:34,382 --> 00:37:39,079
Rym: that happened way at the beginning though Regardless this movie is highly predictable.

559
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:45,950
Rym: if you've seen like three or four other anime in your life You'll probably just know exactly what's gonna happen in this whole show, but it'll still be fun.

560
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:59,249
Scott: If you like movies and things then if you've seen them all and you're looking for more of that and Ghibli doesn't supply frequently enough and you're bored and you want a movie to watch Boy who saw the wind is great.

561
00:37:59,892 --> 00:38:01,016
Rym: there's also a really funny.

562
00:38:01,157 --> 00:38:04,209
Rym: he ends up wake one of the times when he gets knocked out and wakes up somewhere.

563
00:38:04,229 --> 00:38:17,695
Rym: he wakes up in this village and Apparently their sole source of food is hunting these Zabbi Zabbi Zabbi our giant fucking man-eating kill-you-all fish like a whale Barracuda mix thing.

564
00:38:17,735 --> 00:38:27,410
Rym: like a bunch of villagers die and they finally take down this fish and then they have a big feast and then Later and then everyone in the room with us is like why don't they just hunt smaller fish or something?

565
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:28,613
Rym: This is kind of silly.

566
00:38:28,633 --> 00:38:33,070
Rym: and then in the show one characters like why do we hunt these stupid Zabbi all the time?

567
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,795
Scott: Yeah, that's great.

568
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:42,401
Scott: I Something and then whoever made the show gave the message that's not good.

569
00:38:42,682 --> 00:38:45,470
Rym: Yeah, the moral of this show is really heavy-handed.

570
00:38:45,912 --> 00:38:48,503
Scott: It was like you're disrespecting the Zabbi by not eating it.

571
00:38:48,543 --> 00:38:55,882
Scott: Like it's already dead You know and you know, we eat it and it eats us and it's come, you know They tried to make a message out of it.

572
00:38:56,124 --> 00:39:02,649
Rym: That was pretty Yeah, not deep in its presentation like the evil dictator at the end when he like.

573
00:39:04,132 --> 00:39:05,175
Rym: Try to do this not ruin anything.

574
00:39:05,215 --> 00:39:13,064
Rym: basically at the end of the movie when the evil dictator whatever is happening to him He pretty much is like oh, I wasn't evil.

575
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:14,610
Rym: I was just lonely.

576
00:39:16,511 --> 00:39:22,929
Scott: Yeah, it's like they say it right right out whereas other shows are more subtle and subtle is not like.

577
00:39:22,949 --> 00:39:27,868
Rym: surely Stimulating the show is definitely not subtle not subtle at all.
