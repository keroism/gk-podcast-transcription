1
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,672
Rym: It's Monday January 2nd, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,712 --> 00:00:16,178
Rym: We talk about food, and we have a special guest.

3
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:18,488
Guest: Let's do this.

4
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:26,679
Rym: so happy new year Happy 2006. yep, we're back after our short slight hiatus, and we're tired as hell.

5
00:00:27,382 --> 00:00:35,154
Rym: Yeah, we had a lot of people over for a crazy party all weekend And they're all still here, and we're upstairs locked in a bedroom doing the show.

6
00:00:35,174 --> 00:00:36,278
Scott: well some of them are still here.

7
00:00:36,499 --> 00:00:39,857
Rym: Yeah So we started off the new year with a brand new.

8
00:00:39,877 --> 00:00:44,397
Rym: well You know the exploit that we talked about a couple shows ago the WMF.

9
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:51,340
Rym: in Windows It's an image file that if you display it or access it at all it can infect your computer with anything like full access.

10
00:00:51,360 --> 00:01:01,805
Scott: no Matter what program you're using if you a picture can be displayed by that program And it displays a picture in this format and that picture has the bad stuff in it Then your computer will be screwed.

11
00:01:02,527 --> 00:01:04,072
Rym: and well somebody made a worm.

12
00:01:04,111 --> 00:01:05,155
Rym: That's exploiting this.

13
00:01:05,717 --> 00:01:06,519
Scott: well there you go.

14
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:09,649
Scott: I found Windows exploit use.

15
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:17,140
Rym: it's an I am worm and it spreads through Microsoft Messenger right now, and I don't really need to get all the details.

16
00:01:17,441 --> 00:01:19,469
Rym: But it's not so simple as it shows you the image.

17
00:01:19,911 --> 00:01:21,779
Rym: it shows you a link to a JPEG image.

18
00:01:22,561 --> 00:01:32,675
Rym: But the dot jpg is actually an HTML which links to the WMF which then gives you the virus Which is a collect credit card numbers and send them to someone randomly.

19
00:01:32,715 --> 00:01:37,352
Scott: thing great Yeah, can't they just see where the credit cards are being sent to and catch the guy?

20
00:01:37,773 --> 00:01:43,533
Rym: usually these things are sent to like anonymous Unmoderated IRC channels that then disappear on like shadow IP addresses.

21
00:01:44,356 --> 00:01:50,480
Rym: Oh, that's not very good Yeah, but basically this vulnerability is not patched not easily patchable.

22
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:53,825
Rym: I mean a lot of people have said that there's a patch for it And that's kind of true.

23
00:01:54,346 --> 00:01:59,224
Rym: some dude and like Gibson that security guy looked at it and said yeah, this is okay This isn't a bad patch.

24
00:01:59,946 --> 00:02:16,199
Rym: they it mitigates the vulnerability it makes it less easy To be exploited, but there's really no way to do it because the vulnerabilities in a certain DLL file that all of Windows uses You under link that DLL which most people don't even know how to do Windows will likely not work.

25
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:19,973
Scott: Well, you'd have to modify the DLL, but of course it's part of Windows.

26
00:02:20,013 --> 00:02:20,736
Scott: It's closed source.

27
00:02:20,816 --> 00:02:21,599
Scott: No one knows what's in it.

28
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:25,030
Scott: Modifying it would mean disassembling it and it's pretty tricky.

29
00:02:25,251 --> 00:02:27,960
Rym: Yeah, I mean there are decompilers and they exist.

30
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:37,660
Rym: But for anyone who doesn't code and doesn't know about this sort of thing Decompilers which take compiled code and like try to recreate the source code for it don't really work.

31
00:02:38,144 --> 00:02:39,319
Scott: They don't work well at all.

32
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:46,427
Rym: They give you just this mess of useless garbage that if you run a decompiler and then you immediately try to recompile that code It usually just won't even work.

33
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:52,180
Scott: Hmm most of the time Yeah, I mean a lot of CS students will try to cheat with decompilers.

34
00:02:52,240 --> 00:03:00,656
Scott: They'll be like aha the teacher has given us a working solution to the problem But we don't have any source code and the goal is to write source code.

35
00:03:00,677 --> 00:03:01,520
Scott: that does the same thing.

36
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,846
Scott: The example program does.

37
00:03:03,207 --> 00:03:04,211
Scott: they're like, I'm so smart.

38
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:06,300
Scott: I will decompile it and just copy the source code.

39
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,174
Scott: Well, there's a reason the teachers don't care about giving you the sample solution and trust me.

40
00:03:11,214 --> 00:03:12,037
Scott: They're CS teachers.

41
00:03:12,057 --> 00:03:13,160
Scott: They know about decompilers.

42
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:16,040
Scott: Yeah, you they really don't work so well, they won't help you.

43
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:26,059
Rym: I mean basically if you're a computer science student and you cheat to get a good grade if you cheat well enough to where you Didn't get caught by one of these CS professors you deserve to pass because you're smarter than they are.

44
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:33,648
Scott: Yeah, I mean if you manage to get a decompiler working even if it to the point where it's the best decompiling job That can possibly be done.

45
00:03:33,688 --> 00:03:35,279
Scott: Let's say you set that up somehow, right?

46
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,320
Scott: And then you're still gonna have to do a lot to that decompiled code to make it something you can submit.

47
00:03:41,902 --> 00:03:45,679
Scott: And if you can do that, then you could probably have done the assignment in the first place.

48
00:03:46,281 --> 00:03:51,960
Rym: Well, you know the situation of a criminal who puts more effort into stealing money than it would take to just get a frickin.

49
00:03:52,461 --> 00:03:57,548
Scott: Yeah Yep exactly that situation.

50
00:03:57,789 --> 00:03:59,658
Rym: but we don't want to scare monger or you know.

51
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,157
Rym: Just really work this up and really not gonna talk about this exploit anymore because it's in the news.

52
00:04:05,198 --> 00:04:05,740
Rym: You can see it.

53
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,258
Rym: We've talked about it twice already.

54
00:04:07,903 --> 00:04:14,699
Rym: But watch out like seriously don't go to websites You don't trust and don't click on links if you don't know where they go or who sent them to you.

55
00:04:14,941 --> 00:04:18,079
Rym: You know, this is a bad vulnerability and it will screw you.

56
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,963
Scott: I just don't get it.

57
00:04:19,004 --> 00:04:21,031
Scott: Like this is the third or fourth time that we've said.

58
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,760
Scott: This is the last straw for Windows.

59
00:04:23,102 --> 00:04:30,010
Scott: Here is a security hole that is easily exploited Difficult to protect from and it pretty much screws you over.

60
00:04:30,592 --> 00:04:31,835
Scott: don't use Windows anymore.

61
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,439
Scott: It's your only hope only hope.

62
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:34,795
Rym: You'll be one.

63
00:04:34,836 --> 00:04:35,637
Scott: Kenobi You know what?

64
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:42,360
Scott: People are still using windows and the camel's back has not yet been broken despite being smashed on with many sledgehammers.

65
00:04:42,706 --> 00:04:44,704
Rym: well part of I mean Two factors here.

66
00:04:44,804 --> 00:04:51,219
Rym: one is that people don't seem to realize how much this spyware and adware that they get infected with affects the performance of their computers.

67
00:04:52,022 --> 00:05:01,232
Rym: I mean a clean Windows XP system with all the service packs with old XP without all the crazy patches preventing You know security else but even with all the patches, it's not that bad.

68
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:03,600
Rym: It's pretty stable and it's generally pretty good.

69
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:11,057
Rym: But most people have so much spyware on the machines and they don't realize it and that slows the computer down to the point that They think they need to buy a new one.

70
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:14,813
Rym: Yep, and to a lot of a lot of infection.

71
00:05:14,934 --> 00:05:19,280
Rym: if an infective agents now They're they don't tell you that your computer is infected.

72
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,378
Rym: They don't do anything to you.

73
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:30,220
Rym: all they do is they spew garbage out of the network port and other people's computers or They hold where's files for other people to get later or they steal your credit card number?

74
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,846
Rym: which you wouldn't realize right away.

75
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:38,360
Scott: and people complain about a lot of things like ads and You know spam and all that sort of stuff going on.

76
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,492
Scott: But most of that is because your computer isn't secure.

77
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:45,266
Scott: if your computer is secure and set up properly Ads and spam really don't happen.

78
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:49,500
Scott: You know, most spam comes from people whose computers who were all infected.

79
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:50,767
Scott: That's where the spam comes from.

80
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:52,860
Scott: It's you you're sending the spam, but you don't know it.

81
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,840
Rym: There was a guy at work at my work who doesn't read slashdot and he said he didn't read it because of the ads.

82
00:05:58,362 --> 00:06:02,419
Rym: and I said what those are like the most unobtrusive ads ever and if you really wanted you could block them.

83
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:07,079
Rym: and and I and he was like unobtrusive their pop-ups and pop-unders and they pop all over the place.

84
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:11,000
Rym: and At this point I was like what slashdot doesn't have pop-ups.

85
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:12,467
Scott: It never will and never did.

86
00:06:12,488 --> 00:06:13,131
Rym: it never will.

87
00:06:13,714 --> 00:06:16,754
Rym: even if slashdot turned evil They wouldn't use pop-ups because they're not stupid.

88
00:06:17,016 --> 00:06:17,178
Rym: Mm-hmm.

89
00:06:17,761 --> 00:06:26,615
Rym: So I look at his computer and he's got just like pop-up spyware and apparently it was just randomly It happened to pop up a lot of the ads when slashdot was open and he assumed that slashdot was the cause.

90
00:06:26,635 --> 00:06:39,076
Rym: Mm-hmm Yeah, I couldn't even fix it because ad aware is not free to corporations and this is work computer and You can use Microsoft anti spyware, but it's none of the spyware.

91
00:06:39,116 --> 00:06:40,180
Scott: things are complete enough.

92
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,640
Scott: There's no way to 100% protect yourself and it's just not worth the effort of protecting.

93
00:06:45,601 --> 00:06:51,343
Rym: So I guess if you need a New Year's resolution and you're a computer guy at all or computer girl If

94
00:06:51,363 --> 00:06:52,938
Scott: you use your computer more than once a day

95
00:06:53,782 --> 00:06:59,159
Rym: Try to learn Linux get an Ubuntu CD or a Linux any sort of Linux live CD and just play with it.

96
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:04,380
Rym: Because within a few years you might need to move off of Windows if things get bad enough.

97
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:05,624
Scott: Yeah, you might just.

98
00:07:05,804 --> 00:07:16,595
Scott: you know, if you depend on your computer for your business or especially for your business But for your entertainment or for anything Then you know Windows just might not cut it in a few years.

99
00:07:16,675 --> 00:07:21,334
Scott: if Vista, you know It's all DRM like they say it's gonna be in such now.

100
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:24,046
Rym: We're not trying to be Linux L. It's like oh use Linux open source.

101
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:25,533
Scott: We can get an apple if you got mad money.

102
00:07:25,634 --> 00:07:26,216
Rym: Yeah, I get an apple.

103
00:07:26,257 --> 00:07:26,980
Rym: apples are fantastic.

104
00:07:27,061 --> 00:07:28,575
Rym: We're thinking about buying one to do this show.

105
00:07:28,595 --> 00:07:39,880
Rym: Yeah But this is just it's good advice from us to you You really knowing Linux in the over the course of the next couple decades is going to be a very useful skill in the world.

106
00:07:40,343 --> 00:07:42,620
Rym: And even if you don't think it will be you'd be surprised.

107
00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:57,938
Scott: Yeah, even if you're not even a computer guy or anything if you're just you know, some normal person You know, this is a nerdy thing that is gonna come and affect you, you know A lot of people are like, you know They're in some profession and they say oh the things in my profession affect other people and they don't even know it.

108
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:02,240
Scott: and then You walk around seeing other people getting screwed by that thing.

109
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:08,848
Scott: You know, like if you're a florist and you see people buying bad flowers, you know, like man, you should really know this You wouldn't buy bad flowers.

110
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,077
Scott: It's affecting you in a bad way.

111
00:08:11,186 --> 00:08:18,779
Scott: You know florist doesn't know about computers but you know if other people bought better flowers that would make the florist happy and it would make the people a lot more happier.

112
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,025
Scott: because You know, they just don't know.

113
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:21,694
Scott: this is the thing that you should know.

114
00:08:21,755 --> 00:08:22,418
Scott: they can help you out.

115
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,040
Scott: So in Japan they have these hotels I think are really cool.

116
00:08:27,421 --> 00:08:33,539
Scott: They're called the capsule hotels and basically it's like this tube like a tube just big enough for a person to fit in.

117
00:08:34,102 --> 00:08:35,813
Rym: They're actually a little bigger that you can kind of sit off.

118
00:08:35,852 --> 00:08:36,980
Scott: if you're not you can kind of sit up.

119
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,385
Scott: It's not really just that small.

120
00:08:38,405 --> 00:08:39,250
Scott: It's not like a coffin.

121
00:08:39,451 --> 00:08:41,620
Scott: No, it's a little bigger than that, but it's not big at all.

122
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:47,820
Scott: I mean they stack these things up vertically and horizontally and everything and it's pretty much a cheap hotel.

123
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:59,407
Scott: So if you're one person on a business trip and you want to save money You know you pay a very small fee and you get a bed and like a little TV next to your head for the night and it's very Practical and efficient.

124
00:08:59,568 --> 00:09:05,580
Rym: Yep, and usually in the building or next door There's a bunch of public showers and things so you can shave and shower and do all that stuff before you go to sleep.

125
00:09:06,014 --> 00:09:34,443
Scott: Yep not like these American hotels where you have like all this space and you have to pay huge amounts of money and go through a Whole ordeal and you get furniture you don't use and all this kind of stuff like, you know The kind of space you would need if you were staying for weeks and weeks and weeks, you know Some people do need but most people will stay in hotels for maybe like a weekend and you don't really need all that stuff you know, there's no point to it, so someone is finally taking this idea out of Japan and into London and They're calling it.

126
00:09:34,604 --> 00:09:38,383
Scott: Well the company I think they're calling it Yotel Y-o-t-e-l.

127
00:09:38,423 --> 00:09:40,670
Rym: Yep, Slashdot called them coffin hotels.

128
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,635
Scott: Yeah, it's not quite coffin sized.

129
00:09:42,695 --> 00:09:44,440
Scott: It's actually bigger than the Japanese hotels.

130
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:50,220
Scott: They're 10 meters by 10 meters squared in floor space and the ceiling is actually as high as you know.

131
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,043
Scott: A normal ceiling is.

132
00:09:51,645 --> 00:09:55,480
Rym: they're about the size of you ever lived in the on the East Coast on like the Jersey Shore.

133
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:58,180
Rym: There used to be all these like maybe 10 years ago.

134
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:10,705
Rym: There used to be all these little like tiny beach houses like on the beach and in Britain London They have these things a lot there not in London But in Britain these tiny little beach houses and they're just big enough for like one person to crash on the floor on a little And change into a swimsuit,

135
00:10:11,147 --> 00:10:14,540
Scott: yep, well these hotels are 10 feet 10 meters squared.

136
00:10:14,922 --> 00:10:24,856
Scott: they come with the sofa that turns into a bed, you know, it's a couch bed couch bed and It doesn't really have a real television, you know, but what it does come with is a sofa.

137
00:10:24,876 --> 00:10:28,006
Scott: I already said that Desk that you pull down.

138
00:10:28,408 --> 00:10:30,897
Scott: So it's like you pull it out of the wall and you can put something on it.

139
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,838
Scott: Closet space very small amount of closet space.

140
00:10:36,141 --> 00:10:38,250
Scott: Some mood lighting which is always cool, you know.

141
00:10:39,294 --> 00:10:51,380
Scott: a shower very useful Wireless internet the most useful an iPod connection so you can plug your iPod into the hotel room and the sound comes out of the Speakers in the hotel room and there's a flat-screen TV, which saves a lot of space.

142
00:10:52,961 --> 00:10:57,899
Scott: And you know these things are gonna put them in airports and all kinds of other places where hotels are used very often.

143
00:10:58,502 --> 00:10:59,908
Rym: But they're also places like that.

144
00:10:59,948 --> 00:11:02,820
Rym: those hotels are used very often, but they're used for like one night usually.

145
00:11:03,081 --> 00:11:13,795
Scott: Yep, if you stay in an airport hotel, that's because your flight got canceled and you're stuck there or it could be because you came on a trip and You know, you have to make a transfer the next day - that's international.

146
00:11:14,157 --> 00:11:20,420
Rym: Yeah So why do you want to pay 300 bucks for a huge hotel room that you're gonna be in for like a few hours while?

147
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:20,883
Rym: You're asleep.

148
00:11:20,903 --> 00:11:23,539
Scott: You're only gonna use like the bed the shower and maybe the TV.

149
00:11:23,901 --> 00:11:24,904
Scott: You don't it means here.

150
00:11:24,945 --> 00:11:36,980
Scott: has anyone here ever actually used the the the nightstand Anything other than the telephone and the clock and once once I unpacked my clothes into the dresser of a hotel.

151
00:11:37,361 --> 00:11:40,433
Rym: Wow, but I stayed in the same hotel room for a week a week.

152
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,337
Scott: I can understand a week.

153
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:46,460
Scott: Yeah But anyway, they say it's gonna cost about 70 bucks a night, which is real cheap.

154
00:11:46,902 --> 00:11:55,717
Rym: yeah, I mean we go to Baltimore every year for that Otakon and The cheapest cheapest hotel rooms are over $100 a night and usually we spend about 300 a night.

155
00:11:55,957 --> 00:12:06,920
Scott: and they say you can also Book it for four hour periods Which is real useful if you have like a transfer or you want to just take a little nap before your flight or you got To the airport way early and breeze through security, you know, you can go take a nap there

156
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:08,370
Rym: Yep, or you're on the road.

157
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,256
Rym: You want to take a shower?

158
00:12:09,276 --> 00:12:17,562
Scott: Yep Now it's not quite, you know The perfect thing that I've been looking for which is even smaller and in New York City Which.

159
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:21,957
Scott: but this could if it succeeds in Britain come over which would make me very happy.

160
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:36,440
Scott: Yes I mean, there's nothing I need more in New York City than a place where I can just either crash for the night for like a hundred bucks or Spend 20 bucks take a shower, you know and shave and change my clothes.

161
00:12:36,561 --> 00:12:37,769
Scott: Yeah, that would be so freaking.

162
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:39,179
Rym: you like say you woke up late for work.

163
00:12:39,481 --> 00:12:42,020
Rym: It'd be so much better to go to go on the same normal train.

164
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,940
Rym: You always go on and then get to the city and then like shave and shower and everything there and then go into the building.

165
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:51,520
Scott: Yep, I mean and think about this, let's say I go to work for the day, right?

166
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,274
Scott: I'm wearing my work clothes, but after work, I want to go hang out with some people.

167
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:56,920
Scott: so I spend 20 bucks.

168
00:12:57,142 --> 00:12:59,119
Scott: I could take a shower to get my work off of me.

169
00:12:59,783 --> 00:13:02,840
Scott: You know, I can change into fun clothes and get off the work clothes.

170
00:13:03,623 --> 00:13:08,654
Scott: I can put all my stuff in a locker that I rent out, you know, and I'm good to go.

171
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:10,547
Scott: Maybe I'll take a little nap if the.

172
00:13:10,627 --> 00:13:14,727
Scott: if I'm going to like a concert that's later at night or maybe a hockey game or Something, you know, who knows?

173
00:13:15,069 --> 00:13:16,619
Rym: Yes, I'd love something like that.

174
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:32,528
Scott: But as it stands if I wanted to go to a concert or a hockey game after work I have to carry a backpack to said hockey game or concert or event or meeting or whatever You know and I got to change my work clothes in the work bathroom and I'll be all stinky from work You know and it's just a pain in the ass.

175
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:32,969
Rym: Yep.

176
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:40,499
Rym: So if any venture capitalists are out there listening to the show Either give us some money and we'll do it or give someone who wants to do this money so we can use it.

177
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:43,616
Scott: Yeah, then, you know, we've got life great and it's glad.

178
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:51,200
Rym: it's good to see that The idea is finally spreading and actually I'm glad that it's starting somewhere like London because this is kind of a stereotype.

179
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:58,382
Rym: But I I get this impression that a lot of foreigners as opposed to Americans would be more open to at least trying something like this Mm-hmm.

180
00:13:58,563 --> 00:14:01,800
Rym: So if it succeeds in Britain because people might try and go oh, this is cool.

181
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:07,320
Rym: And then it comes over here then they can say yeah people in London use this and it's great instead of our at America.

182
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,662
Rym: Here's this weird thing that is kind of weird to you guys.

183
00:14:09,942 --> 00:14:10,343
Rym: What do you think?

184
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:10,963

Scott: I never played it but anyway They have a download page.

189
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:46,730

Scott: Well, this download page has everything.

191
00:14:50,902 --> 00:14:51,303

Scott: It's like hibachi.

Scott: I will do special attention to you.

264
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:34,762
Guest: Yeah, but the real reason that these two guys brought me in here was partially because I'm their friend and partially Okay, they left the front parts like oh, yeah, we're friends, huh, right?

265
00:19:35,123 --> 00:19:42,250
Guest: No, they wanted me to tell a story about Eating in Japan because I had spent some time in Japan one summer and it was lots of fun.

Guest: And if you're ever a chance to study abroad do it because it's it's pretty fun.

267
00:19:45,814 --> 00:19:53,650

268
00:19:53,751 --> 00:19:56,350
Guest: So like let's say you're gonna go eat with a bunch of friends for like an hour and a half.

00:19:56,872 --> 00:20:00,704
Guest: It's like 15 bucks and you can eat all you want for an hour and a half.

270
00:20:00,945 --> 00:20:06,649
Guest: and there's a little conveyor belt that goes around All the tables and it's like comes out in an island in the middle of the restaurant.

271
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:08,659
Rym: Well, I didn't think places like that actually existed.

272
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,181

274
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:20,579
Guest: Yeah it's a think of like a w-shape and the food goes around.

275
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:26,865
Guest: this w-shape like around the side and then around the middle and then Around the side then goes back into the kitchen where we don't know what happens.

276
00:20:27,308 --> 00:20:27,690
Scott: I got it.

277
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:32,028

Guest: But so and the food comes out.

280
00:20:39,057 --> 00:20:42,670
Guest: it's usually like frozen like so like when the beat when the meat starts coming around.

281
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,080
Guest: It's like these frozen like slices.

282
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,610
Scott: So you don't want to sit at the beginning.

283
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:46,235
Guest: What's that?

284
00:20:46,396 --> 00:20:47,745
Scott: You see don't want to sit at the beginning part?

285
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:51,350
Guest: Well, I mean Even if the food goes around it's it's it's supposed to be frozen.

286
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:52,525
Guest: So it keeps cold until you cook it.

287
00:20:52,870 --> 00:21:00,910
Guest: Because what you do is you take it off and you put it in this little burner grill that's in the middle And you cook it there like this suction that sucks the smoke off of there.

288
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,698
Guest: So you're not like filling the entire place with smoke.

289
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:13,470
Guest: now something to understand is that in Japan beef is really expensive Like you don't find $20 steaks you find like a 30 or 40 dollar steak in his like hamburger meat.

290
00:21:14,052 --> 00:21:16,886
Guest: it's like it's ninja food like the ninja food story - if you want.

291
00:21:17,449 --> 00:21:23,541
Guest: but So this foods going around and we're Americans going to the Japanese place and we're like, oh, yeah It's just it's just beef.

292
00:21:23,561 --> 00:21:24,227
Guest: we cook it we eat it.

293
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:35,610
Guest: So we sit down and we didn't know also at the time that They don't clear your plates as you're eating because all the food comes around these little like the five inch in in radius dishes.

294
00:21:36,751 --> 00:21:45,769
Guest: so they're going around and we're taking food and we're eating and we're taking food and reading and These plates start piling up at the table and they're piling up and they're piling up and the waiters are sort of looking at us.

295
00:21:45,849 --> 00:21:49,287
Guest: funny Because you know, they've never seen like an American person like ever I guess.

296
00:21:51,514 --> 00:22:04,530
Guest: And and you know the plates are piling up and we see them talking to each other and one of one of the guys there spoke a lot of Japanese because he was like advanced and he was like they're asking each Other whether or not they should clear our plates and I was like, oh my gosh, what's why are they doing that?

297
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,102
Guest: We found out later that they don't clear the plates until after you leave.

298
00:22:07,142 --> 00:22:08,489
Guest: like did the help and you don't see them?

299
00:22:09,271 --> 00:22:14,087
Guest: So eventually they like they're like chuckling at us and laughing and they're taking away the plates and we were there for like the full hour and a half.

300
00:22:14,951 --> 00:22:22,122
Guest: But when you put four Americans with small amounts of beef in front of a grill and just have them eat There's never like a filling because you're digesting as you're eating.

301
00:22:22,142 --> 00:22:22,885
Guest: so these.

302
00:22:22,965 --> 00:22:26,015
Guest: we ate something like 132 between four guys.

303
00:22:26,035 --> 00:22:27,298
Guest: Wow 32 plates of food.

304
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:30,948
Guest: I think you'll imagine this place being like, oh, we just lost so much money.

305
00:22:31,228 --> 00:22:43,350
Guest: Oh, no So, you know and we're eating like desserts everything we walk out of there and as soon as we leave These guys are like laughing their asses off and pointing at us as we leave like we're like, wow, that was cool We gotta go back next time.

306
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:43,813
Scott: No, you know what?

307
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:44,537
Scott: They were laughing at.

308
00:22:44,578 --> 00:22:46,510
Scott: was the guys in the back on the other end of the conveyor?

309
00:22:47,331 --> 00:22:52,873
Guest: That's something else we notice is that the meat started out like soft and as we were there the meat started getting like more and more Frozen.

310
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,061
Guest: so we figure the guys in the back are going.

311
00:22:54,101 --> 00:22:55,290
Guest: Oh my god, what's happening to all the meat?

312
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:02,745
Guest: Shave some more meat off put it on the thing And you know last we went back again like three days later with like eight people.

313
00:23:02,825 --> 00:23:09,184
Guest: the same thing happened Except we like 400 plates of food Like all right, no more guide you.

314
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:15,270
Guest: yeah, seriously They're like sorry you guys can't say this long anymore because we're losing tons of money on you for eating our really expensive beef.

315
00:23:15,914 --> 00:23:23,890
Scott: I mean, I've heard of business mails file Failing against new technology, but business mails failing against new nationalities.

316
00:23:25,111 --> 00:23:26,136
Guest: They didn't count on the American.

317
00:23:26,216 --> 00:23:30,890
Guest: It was like it was, you know, you think barbecue you eat at a barbecue, you know You keep on grazing you go around.

318
00:23:31,312 --> 00:23:35,390
Guest: So this is like instead of the grazing the food just kept coming to us and we're like hey more beef thrown on the Barbie.

319
00:23:35,711 --> 00:23:38,723
Rym: I can feel like the moment you guys sit down the beef just stops coming back around.

320
00:23:38,743 --> 00:23:39,787
Guest: It's like all vegetables.

321
00:23:39,807 --> 00:23:42,469
Guest: It's like damn Yeah, they found us out.

322
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:45,457
Guest: The ninja food was kind of was kind of amusing.

323
00:23:45,498 --> 00:23:54,208
Guest: do like if you go to Japan ever or any other country that doesn't have Like native food like a lot of people think like American Italian restaurants are like Italian food.

324
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:55,227
Scott: Not at all They're wrong.

325
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:56,093
Guest: You know.

326
00:23:56,194 --> 00:23:57,299
Guest: the same thing happens in Japan.

327
00:23:57,319 --> 00:24:04,108
Guest: if you go to Japan like the only American food you're gonna get Or even anything close is gonna be like McDonald's and that's not really American food.

328
00:24:04,128 --> 00:24:04,650

Scott: all the food you eat in any particular country is you know or 90% of it Anyway is food of that country and if they say it's food of a different country It's just pretending to be that of the country.

Guest: Yeah There was something like some story on FARC about like in was a Beijing or something like that during the New Year or something.

378
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:34,350
Guest: It was some Asian country and it was like during the New Year's like two guys died because they ate firecrackers.

Scott: Well, it's what did the firecrackers say on them like food?

380
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:40,550
Rym: You know what if there's a fuse coming out of your food, don't?

381
00:26:42,591 --> 00:26:44,461
Guest: If there's a fuse coming out there's something else up.

382
00:26:44,843 --> 00:26:46,230
Scott: did they light him first and then eat him.

383
00:26:46,755 --> 00:26:47,401
Guest: I have no idea.

384
00:26:47,421 --> 00:26:48,350
Guest: I didn't read the whole story.

385
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,097
Guest: I was like, I was just.

386
00:26:49,198 --> 00:26:50,470
Guest: you know, you read FARC half the time.

387
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,840
Guest: We don't need to read this exploding.

388
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,646
Scott: Yeah, labor drtf.

389
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:53,632
Guest: I think it is.

390
00:26:54,134 --> 00:26:59,339
Rym: in fact if you read the story a lot of times it ruins it because the headlines funny and then you read The story is like wow.

391
00:26:59,439 --> 00:27:04,510
Rym: That was a horrible thing that happened to whoever that was Emphasis on was or that was boring.

392
00:27:05,733 --> 00:27:07,629
Guest: That wasn't at all what the the article was.

393
00:27:08,206 --> 00:27:09,696
Scott: Yeah I hate it when headlines are misleading.

394
00:27:09,736 --> 00:27:19,985
Rym: that just pisses me off all the time except the fake headlines on FARC the ones that are there just to trick news anchors and Morning radio news guys who like to just read FARC for the living.

395
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,453
Guest: Those are the disappointing I know.

396
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:30,070
Guest: just also like on my local wacky radio Wacky DJ radio show like back in Maryland where I used to live You just have Elliot in the morning and they they would always get all these funny news stories.

397
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,421
Guest: I was like, aha funny news stories and then I was like, wait a minute.

398
00:27:32,782 --> 00:27:33,546
Scott: He's reading FARC.

399
00:27:33,606 --> 00:27:34,369
Guest: It's all just awful fun.

400
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:41,634
Rym: Yeah, every now and then FARC will put like a fake story and then in the comments It'll be like alright the story is fake or This?

401
00:27:41,755 --> 00:27:43,690
Rym: we just made this up or we link to a parody site.

402
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:47,369
Rym: We know it's fake and then it's just kind of a game to see how many news people reported as truth.

403
00:27:48,071 --> 00:27:48,191
Guest: Mm-hmm.

404
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:52,247
Scott: It's always good and then they'll be like, you know W whatnot reported.

405
00:27:52,287 --> 00:27:52,789
Scott: This is true.

406
00:27:53,731 --> 00:27:55,265
Scott: Okay, something something something said.

407
00:27:55,286 --> 00:27:55,710
Scott: this is cool.

408
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:00,988
Scott: This morning radio guy reads FARC, so does this one.

409
00:28:02,051 --> 00:28:07,090
Rym: They all know we read FARC and we're not on the radio, but unless we get some pirate radio going at some point.

410
00:28:07,591 --> 00:28:09,057
Scott: Yeah, I don't think pirate radio is necessary.

411
00:28:09,097 --> 00:28:12,167
Guest: when you have podcast that calls for an mp3 that we need the pirate radio mp3.

412
00:28:12,188 --> 00:28:14,469
Scott: now It's anyway food.

413
00:28:16,253 --> 00:28:18,690
Guest: Yeah, one of the interesting food stories of how we run across recently.

414
00:28:18,891 --> 00:28:19,253
Scott: Well, I don't know.

415
00:28:19,273 --> 00:28:21,990
Scott: We've had a lot of food trouble lately trying to you know, have a party.

416
00:28:22,432 --> 00:28:25,203
Rym: Yeah, we've learned that like we said previously.

417
00:28:25,263 --> 00:28:26,929
Rym: Yes, our friends can eat all the food we have.

418
00:28:27,612 --> 00:28:36,619
Scott: Yeah, I mean we never really we've had parties before but we never really provided food because we were poor and It wasn't so many people.

419
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:43,793
Rym: for an extended period of time People would come and go and they'd walk like they bring their own food or we'd like go to someone else's apartment raid their Fridge and then leave.

420
00:28:43,813 --> 00:28:47,408
Scott: Yeah, but now you're expecting to have dinner from anywhere between like 10 and 30 people.

421
00:28:48,152 --> 00:28:54,250
Rym: Yeah, because a half of our friends are cool and we're like, yeah We're coming to your party and half of her friends just disappeared off the internet for the two weeks before.

422
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:57,483
Scott: Yeah, I mean keep your communications up, especially if you want free food.

423
00:28:57,764 --> 00:28:58,025
Rym: Yes.

424
00:28:58,045 --> 00:29:01,229
Rym: Yeah, cuz we had free food We got actual catering and it came and we ate it.

425
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,033
Scott: But anyway, we had.

426
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:03,498
Scott: we had no idea how much to get.

427
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:08,969
Scott: so we pretty much just did a crapshoot saying well We'll learn this time and get it right the next time.

428
00:29:10,212 --> 00:29:12,845
Rym: Yeah, yeah, no one said I'm hungry after we ate.

429
00:29:13,006 --> 00:29:13,890
Guest: there's no plenty left downstairs.

430
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:19,030
Scott: We just called the pizza guys and we said bring two trays of this and a tray of garlic knots and all those garlic knots.

431
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:21,198
Rym: Yeah, we should have gotten twice as many of those.

432
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:25,950
Scott: Yeah, I don't know why we got so I didn't realize there were a lot Of garlic knots and I opened it up and I said that'll be gone.

433
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:29,345
Guest: I had like one and there was like a whole plate of so someone was like scarfing someone.

434
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:31,620
Scott: I had three or four So we're like there were like 50 in there.

435
00:29:33,451 --> 00:29:36,083
Guest: Somebody just just jacked like a whole bunch of them once.

436
00:29:36,606 --> 00:29:37,108
Scott: it must have been.

437
00:29:38,331 --> 00:29:39,798
Scott: But I didn't eat the the chicken.

438
00:29:39,838 --> 00:29:42,330
Scott: I only ate the noodles, which is very very good.

439
00:29:42,932 --> 00:29:46,749
Rym: Yeah, the chicken Marsala was okay, but a lot of people like did like mushrooms and wouldn't eat it.

440
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:48,034
Guest: I dug the mushroom.

441
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:50,885
Guest: I definitely dug the ziti when I dug the Marsala.

442
00:29:51,005 --> 00:29:51,186
Guest: Yeah.

443
00:29:51,226 --> 00:29:52,210
Scott: Yeah, we'll learn next time.

444
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,670
Scott: We won't get the chicken Marsala again, especially because it made a big mess.

445
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:55,432
Guest: Yeah, I have I have.

446
00:29:55,673 --> 00:30:00,550
Guest: I have serious concerns about any food that is so much slathered in sauce that it is its own soup.

447
00:30:01,014 --> 00:30:02,065
Guest: Yeah, it's like.

448
00:30:02,186 --> 00:30:08,509
Guest: yeah I want to eat the chicken But I got to find it like I got to dig around in there first under the brown to find where the chicken is.

449
00:30:09,032 --> 00:30:16,270
Rym: The one issue that we had and we didn't realize we had it until right before we ordered the food Was that one of our friends and only one is a vegetarian?

450
00:30:17,073 --> 00:30:20,204
Rym: So we planned out all the food and then we looked and we're like, wait a minute.

451
00:30:20,706 --> 00:30:23,900
Rym: every single piece of food We're providing has meat in it somewhere.

452
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,483
Rym: Mm-hmm.

453
00:30:24,885 --> 00:30:25,850
Rym: Like alright crap.

454
00:30:26,371 --> 00:30:26,993
Rym: What are we gonna do?

455
00:30:27,013 --> 00:30:32,810
Rym: and we're the most places who provide food like catering food don't seem to have vegetarian food.

456
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:33,613
Rym: That doesn't suck.

457
00:30:34,256 --> 00:30:34,557
Scott: Yeah.

458
00:30:34,598 --> 00:30:37,490
Scott: Well, at least the problem is is that we can't really ask.

459
00:30:37,811 --> 00:30:42,008
Rym: At the party I made that salad in a pair of boxers like earlier in the day.

460
00:30:42,028 --> 00:30:43,334
Guest: Wow Yeah, I've never.

461
00:30:43,414 --> 00:30:46,050
Guest: I've never had salad that has been mixed inside of boxers before.

462
00:30:47,034 --> 00:30:47,825
Guest: I'm glad I didn't eat it.

463
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:52,709
Scott: Well, the thing is that you know, we as meat-eating people look at vegetarian food and go that's not good.

464
00:30:53,031 --> 00:30:56,642
Scott: But then the vegetarian people might think differently, but we can't really order for them.

465
00:30:57,103 --> 00:31:01,381
Guest: Oh, well, oh speaking of vegetarian food I told this story earlier today, but I should probably tell it again.

466
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:07,430
Guest: an old roommate of mine Was was dating a girl who was a vegetarian and this is in college.

467
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:22,261
Guest: so I had three roommates at the time and one of them was dating a girl who was vegetarian and one of them was very Considerate and decided that she was going to make dinner for everyone when she when this girl came over and she was going to make vegetarian vegan lasagna.

468
00:31:23,266 --> 00:31:29,590
Scott: and Well, I'm not sure if anybody knows I mean I think important ingredient in lasagna is meat.

469
00:31:29,871 --> 00:31:39,389
Guest: Yeah, so, you know an important ingredient in everything that is vegan and not including meat is usually soy Or tofu or some other soy based product.

470
00:31:39,972 --> 00:31:45,050
Rym: So unless you're a Neville level 9 vegan a level 9 vegan that's a militant vegan.

471
00:31:45,613 --> 00:31:47,529
Rym: No, you're only allowed to eat things that don't cast a shadow.

472
00:31:50,372 --> 00:31:59,342
Guest: So anyhow, she decided that tofu would make a good replacement for the ricotta cheese in lasagna and That it's wrong with cheese.

473
00:31:59,362 --> 00:32:00,450
Guest: I don't know.

474
00:32:02,312 --> 00:32:04,839
Scott: It's from a. So you can't do that.

475
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:09,893
Guest: vegans are like, oh no, you're stealing from it's from vitamin D from Vegetarian.

476
00:32:09,933 --> 00:32:12,930
Rym: is I don't eat animals vegan is I don't eat animals or things that come from animals?

477
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,522
Scott: Well, I thought it was just they didn't eat like eggs and things.

478
00:32:15,622 --> 00:32:17,330
Guest: Yeah eggs come from animals milk come from man.

479
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:22,356
Scott: I mean, I know vegetarians who do eat eggs, you know, but Vegan was just not egg.

480
00:32:22,376 --> 00:32:24,081
Scott: I didn't think it was not milk.

481
00:32:24,101 --> 00:32:27,210
Rym: Either vegan is a step more militant and a step more restrictive.

482
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:29,865
Guest: Yeah, I got I got sworn it by a vegan once and I was like screw you heavy.

483
00:32:29,925 --> 00:32:32,388
Guest: I'm higher for the food chain Got a job.

484
00:32:34,391 --> 00:32:42,686
Guest: But so she makes this this thing and one of the properties of tofu and this is sort of like little known is that it will absorb the flavor and odor of anything that it is cooked with.

485
00:32:43,148 --> 00:32:45,633
Rym: and so Hmm.

486
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:49,930
Scott: Yeah, so I like about tofu is that it doesn't really taste like much except for the flavor you put into it.

487
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:53,630
Scott: Yeah, so you just want to you have a sauce that you really like and you just want to eat it straight.

488
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:54,938
Scott: I just pour it right on there.

489
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:56,830
Guest: You know, you could like make spaghetti with meat sauce.

490
00:32:57,032 --> 00:33:03,350
Guest: Yeah, instead of meat just throw in some like, you know Maybe meat flavoring of some sort and then throw in some tofu and hey, you got like fake meatballs.

491
00:33:03,631 --> 00:33:04,133
Scott: Yeah, you can.

492
00:33:04,234 --> 00:33:06,443
Scott: I love it when you just want to eat teriyaki for dinner.

493
00:33:06,463 --> 00:33:07,829
Scott: You just know tofu little teriyaki.

494
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:19,890
Guest: So anyhow, she decides to cook the this this ricotta Not ricotta tofu with broccoli mix and I'm not sure if anybody here has ever smelled like steaming broccoli.

495
00:33:20,472 --> 00:33:22,762
Guest: But go ahead and do it sometime and but it smells.

496
00:33:22,803 --> 00:33:23,506
Guest: nothing like broccoli.

497
00:33:23,526 --> 00:33:24,390
Guest: taste it smells.

498
00:33:25,233 --> 00:33:29,149
Rym: I don't even know what it smells like the things that aren't in the broccoli when you eat it.

499
00:33:29,511 --> 00:33:31,376
Rym: That does not smell good.

500
00:33:31,397 --> 00:33:36,072
Scott: There must be some chemical in the broccoli that breaks down when you heat it and it evaporate comes out In the air.

501
00:33:36,493 --> 00:33:36,995
Guest: Yes, I agree.

502
00:33:37,036 --> 00:33:46,272
Guest: I think I think it pretty much smells like ass like like ass and old socks Like that have been up and ass smells like sweat and dead haws Something like that.

503
00:33:47,095 --> 00:33:48,540
Guest: So yeah, so the tofu.

504
00:33:48,881 --> 00:33:49,844
Guest: she makes this whole dish right.

505
00:33:49,864 --> 00:33:58,342
Guest: then I'm like, I'm gonna be like the anime hero I'm gonna go and you know, I think it's gonna taste bad, but I'm gonna eat it and I'll swallow it down and I'll be whole and she'll think I'm a nice guy.

506
00:33:58,362 --> 00:34:01,197
Guest: and I wasn't trying to like Mack on her or Anything was just trying to be a nice guy, right?

507
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:03,328
Rym: You weren't trying to Mack on her a god.

508
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:05,138
Guest: No We won't go into that.

509
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:06,548
Guest: That's that's for another show.

510
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:23,190
Guest: But uh, so she makes this stuff and she serves it and you know She serves me first and then she serves, you know my my other roommate and his girlfriend who's the vegan and she serves herself and I go and take a bite out of it and I cannot explain how bad this tasted.

511
00:34:23,391 --> 00:34:28,170
Guest: I mean the tofu had absorbed the smell and converted it into taste.

512
00:34:29,091 --> 00:34:29,833
Guest: so you had.

513
00:34:29,955 --> 00:34:37,822
Guest: you had semi tasteless broccoli with ass flavored tofu and Like some red sauce between like coot noodles and stuff.

514
00:34:38,264 --> 00:34:40,297
Guest: So I take a bite and I'm like, I'm like I'll just I'll.

515
00:34:40,317 --> 00:34:46,190
Guest: just took it down took it down I tried to swallow it now just like put like right back on the plate and she looked at me like horrified.

516
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:48,074
Guest: She was like, what'd you do that for?

517
00:34:48,094 --> 00:34:53,210
Guest: I was like, I'm sorry, but just just try it please and I won't feel so bad.

518
00:34:53,351 --> 00:34:53,652
Guest: And I went.

519
00:34:53,713 --> 00:34:54,217
Guest: I was like, I'm sorry.

520
00:34:54,237 --> 00:34:54,679
Guest: I have to do this.

521
00:34:54,721 --> 00:34:55,969
Guest: Don't just scraping it off into the garbage.

522
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,538
Guest: She was like, it can't possibly be that bad.

523
00:34:58,598 --> 00:35:01,750
Guest: I said just just try it and she tries it.

524
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,783
Guest: This is the girl who cooked it and she goes.

525
00:35:03,804 --> 00:35:06,388
Guest: Oh Right back on the plate.

526
00:35:07,711 --> 00:35:10,770
Guest: And so naturally, you know the other two people are like no they got to be screwing with us.

527
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:12,144
Guest: It can't possibly be that bad.

528
00:35:12,204 --> 00:35:20,987
Rym: So naturally So pizza was There's just like when you see someone they eat something there and they make a bad face like oh god.

529
00:35:21,087 --> 00:35:22,039
Rym: and then they like want Some.

530
00:35:23,591 --> 00:35:24,234
Guest: That's a guy thing.

531
00:35:24,616 --> 00:35:26,184
Guest: It's like this tastes awful.

532
00:35:26,244 --> 00:35:26,747
Guest: It tastes like ass.

533
00:35:26,767 --> 00:35:27,068
Guest: try some.

534
00:35:27,591 --> 00:35:39,452
Scott: I'm always worried about like spitting out food because there's only two times I spit out food or like if You know There's something in my mouth and I'm coughing and I'm gonna time lick or something or if like I can't chew it Like.

535
00:35:39,472 --> 00:35:44,776
Scott: that happens a lot where this food is just tough and I can't chew it enough to the point where I can swallow it Even if it tastes good.

536
00:35:44,796 --> 00:35:50,330
Scott: Yeah, like half the stir-fry we try to make yeah And then I'm just trying to find a way to spit it out like nicely.

537
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:53,704
Rym: You know what the best technique is because I can actually get a good nap in on mouth.

538
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:54,588
Scott: is that my mouth.

539
00:35:54,648 --> 00:36:00,501
Rym: you dab the Mouth and you go put and then you just kind of put the napkin aside kind of crumpled So you can't see the giant wad of food.

540
00:36:00,662 --> 00:36:01,810
Guest: Yeah, I do the five-year-old thing.

541
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:06,298
Guest: We just sort of go like bridal and you just lay it right there on the plate Someone else's house.

542
00:36:06,338 --> 00:36:07,105
Rym: You spit under the table.

543
00:36:07,126 --> 00:36:10,476
Guest: They won't notice Only if they have animals pets or something.

544
00:36:10,797 --> 00:36:11,279
Rym: I don't know.

545
00:36:11,299 --> 00:36:13,145
Rym: just pile your Calvin and Hobbes.

546
00:36:13,687 --> 00:36:14,349
Guest: Have you ever had meat gum?

547
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:16,218
Rym: Wait meat gum.

548
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:17,470
Guest: This is this is not meat flavored gum.

549
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:33,870
Guest: This is a term I came up with that was to my mom had made a veal Feels good veal or pork chops or something and had made it Poorly, yeah, I distinctly remember walking around the house chewing and not being able to like break it down in my mouth.

550
00:36:33,951 --> 00:36:39,029
Guest: And I said mom you made meat gum And I'm not sure if that had any effect on her, but she never made it after that.

551
00:36:40,091 --> 00:36:45,010
Guest: Mom, I'm sorry if I if I killed your your your cooking in the veal area.

552
00:36:45,712 --> 00:36:49,006
Rym: We have a serious problem with our stir-fry and basically meat gums.

553
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:50,010
Rym: we now have a word for it.

554
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:53,155
Scott: I don't know my stir-fry doesn't end up as meat gum But it's not much.

555
00:36:53,175 --> 00:36:54,683
Scott: doesn't taste anything like stir-fry.

556
00:36:54,703 --> 00:36:55,950
Scott: I get it real places of awesome.

557
00:36:56,411 --> 00:37:03,251
Rym: We've watched professional chefs do stir-fry and we try to do like we do make the exact same motions and not the same thing comes Out.

558
00:37:03,953 --> 00:37:04,715
Scott: I just don't know what it is.

559
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:09,870
Guest: It's it's you've probably done the British thing and just cook the flavor right out of the food.

560
00:37:10,151 --> 00:37:12,686
Rym: Yeah, but if I don't cook it that much then it's like uncooked chicken.

561
00:37:13,089 --> 00:37:17,109
Rym: Yeah It pretty much goes from raw to black in one second.

562
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:27,269
Scott: Wow, I think it's just a large part of it is because we have an electric oven and yeah every stir-fry guy I've ever seen do something well had some sort of fire.

563
00:37:27,491 --> 00:37:34,302
Rym: Yeah, actually the Culinary Institute people who do the all the cooking in my cafeteria at work They use.

564
00:37:34,584 --> 00:37:36,797
Rym: it's an electric But it's that cool ceramic electric.

565
00:37:36,817 --> 00:37:39,409
Rym: where it's like ceramic pad and then the whole thing heats up at once.

566
00:37:40,032 --> 00:37:41,196
Guest: No words like down in the oven.

567
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:42,401
Rym: Oh, no, it's up.

568
00:37:42,501 --> 00:37:44,609
Rym: It's just like a pad that ceramic and it gets hot.

569
00:37:45,073 --> 00:37:47,250
Rym: Oh, I'm not sure what the mechanism is for getting hot.

570
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:49,874
Guest: Probably electricity.

571
00:37:50,436 --> 00:37:51,219
Rym: Yeah, something like that.

572
00:37:51,762 --> 00:37:58,870
Scott: No a little a little like hamsters on fire That's ceramic is very good because I reheated up a lot without it breaking or melting or anything.

573
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:01,608
Rym: Yeah, hence, you know the ceramic tiles a lot a lot better than metal.

574
00:38:02,691 --> 00:38:04,159
Guest: Okay, metal spaceships over.

575
00:38:04,179 --> 00:38:11,340
Guest: well except dolomite God does that count as inside?

576
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,187
Rym: I don't know.

577
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,857
Rym: Futurama is one reference to dolomite.

578
00:38:14,877 --> 00:38:21,830
Guest: I said I I was trying to explain He the Hebrew hammer to somebody and I said, oh god the Hebrew ham.

579
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:27,702
Guest: I was trying to explain it as juice playtation to a co-worker who was black and I was like It's just like a blacks playtation only its juice playtation.

580
00:38:27,783 --> 00:38:28,950
Guest: and he was like, what's blacks playtation?

581
00:38:31,632 --> 00:38:33,159
Scott: I'm gonna admit something so everyone can laugh.

582
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:34,626
Scott: I have no clue what dolomite is.

583
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:38,288
Guest: Okay Well, I could see not knowing what dolomite, you know blacks playtation is though, right?

584
00:38:38,308 --> 00:38:40,916
Scott: Of course I'm a huge fan of blacks.

585
00:38:40,956 --> 00:38:42,242
Rym: Well, then you should see dolomite.

586
00:38:42,262 --> 00:38:42,663
Rym: He's one.

587
00:38:42,804 --> 00:38:44,310
Scott: Oh, it's a movie called dolomite.

588
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:45,535
Scott: That is a blaxploitation film.

589
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:48,810
Rym: I don't know the movies called dolomite, but there's a character named dolomite.

590
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:55,092
Guest: Yeah, I think I think there is actually a movie called dolomite in which the character is Dolomite.

591
00:38:55,152 --> 00:38:59,369
Rym: Yeah, and in Futurama they make a reference to dolomite at some point.

592
00:39:00,551 --> 00:39:01,738
Guest: Yeah, geeks know we're talking about.

593
00:39:01,799 --> 00:39:02,060
Rym: Yeah.

594
00:39:02,181 --> 00:39:03,670
Guest: Yeah, if you're not a geek should be listening anyhow.

595
00:39:04,132 --> 00:39:07,830
Rym: Three comments in the forums like yeah, it's seasoned blah blah blah in the last four minutes.

596
00:39:08,373 --> 00:39:10,590
Scott: I'm a dolomite calm and it is quite awesome.

597
00:39:13,791 --> 00:39:15,590
Guest: Another thing of the day I feel bad.

598
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:17,380
Guest: I feel like I should have a thing of the day, but I had nothing.

599
00:39:17,541 --> 00:39:18,829
Guest: Rym took mine that I sent him.

600
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:24,235
Rym: Yeah, that sushi thing was given to me by Adam and it was given to him by his girlfriend Mike and you know what?

601
00:39:24,275 --> 00:39:24,596
Rym: It's mine.

602
00:39:24,637 --> 00:39:25,702
Rym: now bitches Beyonce.

603
00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:26,989
Guest: gotta get that right?

604
00:39:27,871 --> 00:39:28,655
Guest: She's looking at you angry.

605
00:39:29,398 --> 00:39:30,142
Rym: Yeah, I see her there.

606
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:30,463
Rym: You know what?

607
00:39:30,483 --> 00:39:36,449
Rym: She can't talk cuz we're on the air live Now she's trying to gesture to me and I can't tell what she's trying to tell me to say.

608
00:39:37,113 --> 00:39:39,001
Rym: Now she's acting like she's eating something.

609
00:39:39,182 --> 00:39:40,508
Guest: She's saying either eat me or bite me.

610
00:39:40,568 --> 00:39:42,387
Rym: one of the two I don't know, but now she's giving up.

611
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:51,678
Scott: So in a reverse non sequitur when you're searching for dolomite reverse Don't type in do lo mit.

612
00:39:51,758 --> 00:39:56,010
Scott: that's that's the name of a mineral discovered by some French mineralogist.

613
00:39:56,552 --> 00:40:00,806
Scott: It's sedimentary search for dolomite like do le like Bob Dole.

614
00:40:00,946 --> 00:40:01,026
Rym: is.

615
00:40:01,046 --> 00:40:02,070
Rym: what about ammo night?

616
00:40:05,394 --> 00:40:06,347
Scott: Yeah, I don't think so.

617
00:40:07,831 --> 00:40:09,358
Scott: I'm definitely checking this movie out though.

618
00:40:09,799 --> 00:40:10,241
Guest: What don't?

619
00:40:10,261 --> 00:40:11,386
Guest: yeah check out here hammer, dude.

620
00:40:11,426 --> 00:40:11,908
Guest: That's a cool one.

621
00:40:12,129 --> 00:40:16,930
Guest: Yeah I know I always mean to but I think the Hebrew hammer that's a holiday treat for the whole family.

622
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:22,597
Rym: Well, we've still got Black Samurai which is supposed to be a blaxploitation about samurai I mean still have yet to watch it.

623
00:40:22,657 --> 00:40:25,450
Scott: like we could watch like we've just been saving it and saving it and saving it.

624
00:40:25,752 --> 00:40:27,323
Rym: We could watch it after we do the show.

625
00:40:27,343 --> 00:40:29,910
Guest: Oh my god You have something next time to talk about again.

626
00:40:30,212 --> 00:40:35,643
Rym: Or we could just save it forever and never actually watch it because it's probably Running now than it will be after we see it.

627
00:40:35,723 --> 00:40:36,950
Guest: You see I thought that you were talking.

628
00:40:37,071 --> 00:40:42,134
Guest: I thought you were explaining the show earlier when you were talking about like the guy getting off the plane and being attacked by ninjas All the time.

629
00:40:42,154 --> 00:40:43,082
Rym: No, that's a different move.

630
00:40:43,102 --> 00:40:43,929
Scott: That's a different movie.

631
00:40:44,171 --> 00:40:45,870
Scott: We love this box set of DVDs.

632
00:40:46,251 --> 00:40:53,870
Rym: This set is just ninja movies movies involving ninjas and I've discovered that while I like ninjas almost every movie involving them is terrible.

633
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:54,811
Scott: Yep,

634
00:40:55,394 --> 00:40:56,622
Guest: like you just scroll

635
00:40:56,803 --> 00:40:57,769
Rym: or three ninjas

636
00:40:59,731 --> 00:41:00,694
Scott: Stop making movies.

637
00:41:00,734 --> 00:41:11,387
Scott: a bunch of people in Hong Kong and other places made a whole crap ton of crap movies with people like Bruce Lay Bruce Lee Bruce lie Bruce lie, but Bruce Lee spelled differently Bruce low.

638
00:41:11,688 --> 00:41:12,410
Rym: and they're all these guys.

639
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:22,170
Scott: They look like Bruce Lee, but they're not as good Yeah, or they're close to Bruce Lee But some of them are good and some of them are but they were just like Bruce Lee clones And they just try to imitate him and make those kind of movies.

640
00:41:22,493 --> 00:41:28,568
Guest: Brandon Lee met that horrible fate and he was pretty cool, too Which is damn shame because he could have been like the next like American martial arts guy.

641
00:41:28,588 --> 00:41:30,154
Rym: Yes There's that new guy the like.

642
00:41:30,334 --> 00:41:33,424
Rym: it's the Filipino kickbox or songs on Bock.

643
00:41:33,685 --> 00:41:35,090
Scott: Well, that's that's the name of the movie.

644
00:41:35,313 --> 00:41:36,209
Scott: Is that his name actually?

645
00:41:38,172 --> 00:41:42,210
Scott: I watched a trailer for that movie and I said that looks awesome, but I haven't seen the movie.

646
00:41:42,391 --> 00:41:51,250
Rym: Yeah, cuz it looked like normal fighting like Jackie Jackie Chan style fighting and then they're like, yeah, no stuntman It's just like Jackie Chan only there was also explosions and it looked serious instead of funny.

647
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:54,385
Guest: Then you have the other end of the spectrum, which is like the the Steven Chow.

648
00:41:55,008 --> 00:42:03,835
Guest: Oh God Yeah, we and we were pointed out today that like oh, yeah We watched was a kung fu hustle and that was awesome and challenge soccer was awesome and God of cookery was strange But awesome, you know what?

649
00:42:03,876 --> 00:42:08,171
Rym: That's a nice reverse non-sequitur Cookery.

650
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:10,259
Guest: I must have leveled up in radio or something.

651
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:10,862
Scott: Yeah, we're not.

652
00:42:10,902 --> 00:42:11,906
Scott: well God of cookery.

653
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:12,810
Scott: Hey, we're talking about food again.

654
00:42:12,952 --> 00:42:13,260
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

655
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:23,796
Rym: So if you need to see a movie and you're bored and it's I think it's on Netflix This movie is called God of cookery and it is quite literally about the God of cooking Like you think.

656
00:42:23,836 --> 00:42:25,024
Guest: it's just like oh the guy is so good.

657
00:42:25,044 --> 00:42:25,366
Guest: He's got.

658
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:29,842
Guest: no no There's actually a God of cooking in the show that appears and it's it's it's.

659
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:33,133
Guest: it falls along the lines of Steven Chow's movies and his Ridiculousness.

660
00:42:33,293 --> 00:42:41,639
Rym: I mean if you like Iron Chef because a lot of geeks are fans of Iron Chef for some inexplicable reason This movie is up your alley You have no idea.

661
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,570
Guest: Yeah, we had some good time.

662
00:42:44,034 --> 00:42:45,506
Guest: The Steven Chow movies I think are there's.

663
00:42:45,526 --> 00:42:56,650
Guest: this thing going backwards is something that what he pointed out is that there are tons and tons and tons and tons of Steven Chow movies and 90% of them suck and I don't know why I Mean, I've seen three of his movies and they were all awesome.

664
00:42:56,753 --> 00:42:59,640
Rym: So I thought all right I'm gonna look up and see what other movies I can get.

665
00:43:00,082 --> 00:43:01,690
Rym: and he has like 40 movies in Netflix.

666
00:43:02,131 --> 00:43:04,720
Rym: So I added them all to the queue and then we watched.

667
00:43:04,841 --> 00:43:08,374
Rym: I watched like one and it was like the worst movie I've ever seen.

668
00:43:08,394 --> 00:43:08,454
Rym: Hmm.

669
00:43:09,177 --> 00:43:12,010
Rym: It just went on and on and on and there was this thing with a mole and it wasn't cool.

670
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:15,350
Scott: It could have been funnier if they cut out a lot of the dumb scenes.

671
00:43:15,531 --> 00:43:17,341
Scott: Maybe it was just like maybe better editing.

672
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:19,111
Guest: who's like his early stuff or something Like?

673
00:43:19,151 --> 00:43:23,330
Guest: maybe maybe he's later stuff that we know that we know what love is good and his early stuff like sucked.

674
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:27,162
Rym: Yeah, cuz I know kung-fu hustle is kind of new and very natural.

675
00:43:27,243 --> 00:43:27,644
Guest: It's new.

676
00:43:27,784 --> 00:43:29,149
Rym: Yeah, God of Cookery is kind of new, too.

677
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:30,233
Guest: You're Beijing.

678
00:43:30,254 --> 00:43:32,303
Guest: I think was it from Beijing with love.

679
00:43:32,323 --> 00:43:33,770
Guest: There's another one that I have them watched yet?

680
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:34,413
Guest: I don't know.

681
00:43:34,453 --> 00:43:35,418
Scott: not I have to see that one.

682
00:43:35,458 --> 00:43:40,730
Scott: I think that was like in the late 90s even if it's any good To do the third reverse non-sequitur.

683
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:44,363
Scott: He actually hires like the same actors for a lot of his movies.

684
00:43:44,704 --> 00:43:50,575
Scott: like if you just watch all the recent ones You'll see like the same actors over and over again And people like the Beast.

685
00:43:50,816 --> 00:43:55,270
Scott: the Beast is actually one of those old Bruce Lee clone guys that he thought was good.

686
00:43:55,611 --> 00:43:58,185
Scott: So he hired him and turned him into not a Bruce Lee clone.

687
00:43:58,266 --> 00:43:58,788
Rym: Oh, really?

688
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:02,722
Scott: Yeah There's a lot of guys like that like that woman the the fat.

689
00:44:02,762 --> 00:44:08,990
Scott: what the landlady and her husband Shallon soccer she was in a lot of other stuff like that was old and crappy.

690
00:44:09,672 --> 00:44:20,968
Scott: So he brings back people who actually like have some martial arts movie talent and puts them in his somewhat good or even better movies You know so that they can fix their reputation for making a bunch of crap movies.

691
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:28,410
Rym: now If you need any kind of impetus to watch God of Cookery There is a scene where they introduce these seven or the nine or some number.

692
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:45,446
Rym: I'll just go with nine because I don't remember the nine brass monks and Basically the main character trained with these monks for a long time and They show the training and basically every time he screws up the monks would punish him and by punishing him They would all appear like on the screen and they would do like these crazy.

693
00:44:45,466 --> 00:44:46,330
Rym: You know kung-fu movies.

694
00:44:46,531 --> 00:44:50,608
Rym: I'm about to do awesome kung-fu setup, and then they would just run over him hit him with a chair.

695
00:44:53,371 --> 00:44:54,173
Rym: It's that kind of humor.

696
00:44:54,575 --> 00:44:59,390
Scott: the movie can be summed up in three words pissing beefballs.

697
00:45:07,308 --> 00:45:10,101
Rym: And That was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
