00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,466
Rym: It's Tuesday November 28th.

2
00:00:11,867 --> 00:00:15,296
Scott: I'm Rym and I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:15,356 --> 00:00:16,820
Rym: We review Wii Sports.

4
00:00:18,381 --> 00:00:19,417
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:20,424 --> 00:00:28,400
Rym: So for the last several days when I come home from work every day I walk past Scott who was in the living room with the Wii moving it around in funny ways.

6
00:00:29,003 --> 00:00:50,400
Rym: I've been up in my room going through the Infinite number of pieces of paper with various glyphs on them that I've accumulated over the last quarter of a century frying desperately to throw away the ones that I don't need and Somehow put them into a fashion of order that will be useful for the next quarter century.

7
00:00:50,902 --> 00:00:52,230
Scott: I don't know what you're saying about this.

8
00:00:52,371 --> 00:00:55,224
Scott: me sitting there playing the Wii Several days.

9
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:55,525
Scott: All right.

10
00:00:55,805 --> 00:01:00,379
Scott: Meanwhile, it's been two days yesterday and today yesterday also last week.

11
00:01:01,302 --> 00:01:03,008
Scott: They mean last week before vacation.

12
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:06,160
Rym: even then I would come home from work and you'd be there with the Wii.

13
00:01:06,642 --> 00:01:07,627
Scott: What day was that?

14
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,335
Rym: Why the day last week?

15
00:01:09,998 --> 00:01:13,167
Scott: I Only went to work one day last week.

16
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:16,576
Rym: Yeah, I went to work more than one day last week.

17
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:21,179
Scott: either way Today I wasn't I only I barely played it even.

18
00:01:22,183 --> 00:01:22,926
Rym: What are you talking about?

19
00:01:22,966 --> 00:01:29,938
Rym: You were downstairs playing the Wii while I was up here doing my files When you got home and I only did it we can go.

20
00:01:29,978 --> 00:01:31,824
Rym: look it was In the door.

21
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:37,360
Rym: you came down said something gave me my edgy CD which is installing next to me right now.

22
00:01:37,421 --> 00:01:39,099
Scott: I actually I burned the edgy CD.

23
00:01:39,221 --> 00:01:41,262
Scott: We're up here a lot longer than you think Cuz.

24
00:01:41,282 --> 00:01:45,757
Rym: then I went upstairs and before I even opened my file folder to continue looking at my pieces of paper.

25
00:01:45,777 --> 00:01:50,866
Rym: I hear downstairs Whatever you're looking.

26
00:01:50,906 --> 00:01:53,577
Scott: go look the Wii keeps a record of how long we've played.

27
00:01:53,698 --> 00:01:54,300
Rym: I'm well aware.

28
00:01:54,461 --> 00:02:02,800
Rym: That's why I don't I feel completely justified in making this argument because you'll go down and look You'll realize how long you actually played the Wii and you'll be quiet today less than an hour.

29
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:09,780
Scott: But anyway, I dad played in total a great deal of Zelda because well Zelda games take a great deal of playing.

30
00:02:10,142 --> 00:02:11,590
Rym: Yeah, and also Wolfie Link.

31
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:16,594
Scott: Yeah, and I got to say that Compared the the product Wind Waker was a great Zelda.

32
00:02:16,635 --> 00:02:17,740
Scott: That was the most recent one.

33
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:24,872
Scott: oh, he's the most recent console and not handheld one and It was good, but my major gripe with it was that it was too short.

34
00:02:24,973 --> 00:02:29,726
Scott: not enough dungeons this game Way too many dungeons.

35
00:02:29,786 --> 00:02:35,706
Rym: these minish cat pissed me off for a great number of reasons far beyond the fact that that wasn't a Console one.

36
00:02:35,726 --> 00:02:36,637
Scott: So not really counting it?

37
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:44,864
Rym: Yeah, well see the thing is for me my DS and by extension the GBA have been my primary gaming console up until the Wii Mm-hmm.

38
00:02:45,306 --> 00:02:47,054
Rym: Well unless you count counter-strike.

39
00:02:47,074 --> 00:02:47,396
Rym: Yeah.

40
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:51,274
Scott: Yeah No, but this Zelda I mean.

41
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:58,600
Scott: I don't know if it's fair to say too many dungeons because if you ask me there can't be too many dungeons Nothing would be better than just infinity dungeon.

42
00:02:58,726 --> 00:03:04,656
Rym: Yeah I mean probably one of the greatest moments in my life is when I was playing Zelda for the SNES.

43
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:11,400
Rym: and there's those three Dungeons and the three things you got to get and you get them all and instead of the game ending it's up.

44
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:13,026
Rym: Well, you've got the three things now.

45
00:03:13,046 --> 00:03:16,120
Rym: You've got to go to the eight other dungeons and do all this other stuff.

46
00:03:16,521 --> 00:03:33,100
Scott: Yeah, ever since the SNES Zelda they've always followed this pattern of you know, do a few dungeons You're confined to a small area where you use basic skills and then as you get more and more abilities You can go to a larger and larger area and eventually you beat three dungeons.

47
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:40,883
Scott: Then maybe there's a fourth dungeon or something and as soon as you do that the game opens up and then there's like the seven Dungeons.

48
00:03:41,065 --> 00:03:47,409
Rym: Yep, and even then you walk or the eight dungeon You're always walking past rocks that you could bomb if you just had a bomb There was a little bit bigger.

49
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:55,339
Rym: or if you had a hammer You could knock that little tiny sticking out of the way, even though really link could just jump over it or kick it.

50
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,649
Scott: Yeah, well Zelda 64 followed mostly the same pattern.

51
00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:00,133
Scott: So did Wind Waker.

52
00:04:00,153 --> 00:04:02,560
Scott: I just had fewer dungeons after the game opened up.

53
00:04:02,787 --> 00:04:10,520
Rym: Yeah But then there's Minish Cap where there's three dungeons and I fully expected the game to open up and instead the game was over.

54
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:17,115
Scott: Yeah, I cried but Twilight Princess man I just got the game to open up.

55
00:04:17,437 --> 00:04:22,377
Scott: today After more than almost it's got to be at least a day of playing.

56
00:04:22,859 --> 00:04:27,478
Scott: if not it's a definitely more than 15 hours almost 20 and I just got the game to open up.

57
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:34,015
Scott: and Even if I didn't get the game to open up, there's so much shit I had to do still in the not opened up game.

58
00:04:34,036 --> 00:04:35,021
Rym: Oh my god See.

59
00:04:35,062 --> 00:04:35,626
Rym: now think of this.

60
00:04:35,646 --> 00:04:46,488
Rym: think about the amount of real-life time You've spent versus what you have caused link to do riding his horse around being a wolf cause and all sorts of mischief changing the World in that time in the real world.

61
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,606
Rym: I succeeded in throwing away approximately 3,000 pieces of paper.

62
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,288
Rym: Yeah, many of them at my feet right now.

63
00:04:56,308 --> 00:04:56,749
Scott: think about this.

64
00:04:56,789 --> 00:05:00,240
Scott: I played so much right and so far I've caught one fish.

65
00:05:00,441 --> 00:05:02,528
Scott: I just did fishing for the first time today.

66
00:05:02,548 --> 00:05:04,516
Scott: a major part of the game the fishing.

67
00:05:04,536 --> 00:05:05,600
Scott: I fished one fish.

68
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,573
Scott: So there's a lot to go in this game.

69
00:05:08,633 --> 00:05:09,780
Rym: a major part of the game.

70
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,787
Rym: They can't be plot involved in the fishing.

71
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:15,340
Scott: No, but the fishing is like a major side game.

72
00:05:15,742 --> 00:05:16,385
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

73
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,060
Rym: I always kind of hated those side games in Zelda games.

74
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,399
Scott: I'm a fan of the side games.

75
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:27,755
Scott: I like to beat all of them, you know, not super completely But some of them give you pieces of heart and I like to get all the heart container.

76
00:05:28,017 --> 00:05:28,660
Rym: Yeah, that's fine.

77
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:31,599
Rym: Yeah, I guess I'm my favorite Zelda games are.

78
00:05:31,619 --> 00:05:37,600
Rym: of course I haven't played all the way through Ocarina of Time and I've never played Majora's Mask or any you don't want to play.

79
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,187
Scott: I haven't even played all Majora's Mask.

80
00:05:39,247 --> 00:05:42,000
Rym: I played it for any of the Gameboy ones except Minish Cap.

81
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,919
Scott: Yeah The original Gameboy one that you got to play.

82
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:54,179
Rym: Well, just no Zelda game since Zelda 2 has given me that sense of awe and fear when finding a new place.

83
00:05:56,202 --> 00:05:57,310
Scott: Let's see Zelda 64 for sure.

84
00:05:58,922 --> 00:06:02,640
Rym: Well, I didn't play that all the way through but SNES Zelda at no point was I afraid.

85
00:06:03,721 --> 00:06:18,629
Scott: No, I actually was a little bit afraid playing Twilight Princess just once when I got caught outside in the dark and I didn't want to go back inside because I wanted to go into the town during the day and Time doesn't pass if you're inside the town.

86
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:20,837
Scott: So I was hanging outside at night.

87
00:06:20,897 --> 00:06:25,792
Scott: It was dark There are monsters and I wanted the Sun to come up.

88
00:06:25,812 --> 00:06:27,680
Scott: so I go back into the town during the day.

89
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,749
Rym: What a terrible night to have a curse.

90
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,412
Scott: Yeah.

91
00:06:30,713 --> 00:06:31,014
Scott: All right.

92
00:06:31,456 --> 00:06:32,220
Scott: Yeah, let's move along.

93
00:06:32,502 --> 00:06:34,676
Rym: So, uh, we could do the anime world order thing.

94
00:06:34,756 --> 00:06:35,199
Rym: Let's news.

95
00:06:36,202 --> 00:06:37,252
Scott: No, it's not.

96
00:06:37,273 --> 00:06:37,919
Scott: Let's not do that.

97
00:06:39,001 --> 00:06:40,225
Rym: We don't have any news music.

98
00:06:40,846 --> 00:06:41,569
Scott: go get some.

99
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:47,139
Rym: I thought I just never found anything good that didn't sound cheesy or would violate copyright in an obvious way.

100
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,204
Scott: Yep, exactly.

101
00:06:51,506 --> 00:06:51,787
Rym: Yeah.

102
00:06:52,189 --> 00:07:03,909
Scott: All right, so I'm gonna talk about this Problem in quotes of people breaking their TVs and breaking their wiimote wrist straps or not Using their wiimote wrist straps.

103
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,140
Rym: I often don't use the remote wrist strap.

104
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:09,199
Scott: Sometimes I don't use it but most of the time I do use it.

105
00:07:09,421 --> 00:07:11,974
Rym: Yeah, I only use it because it's not my wiimote.

106
00:07:12,075 --> 00:07:15,350
Rym: once I own a wiimote There's not even gonna be a wrist strap on that mofo.

107
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,238
Scott: Yeah, but what if you you know what?

108
00:07:17,338 --> 00:07:17,680
Rym: you know what?

109
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:30,140
Rym: I am confident in mind the minimal level of dexterity and Consciousness that I have to not drop a wiimote or throw it against the wall or lose my grip on it somehow.

110
00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:39,400
Scott: Yeah, see I'm more worried about the not so much worried about the wiimote breaking But as in other things breaking around if the wiimote gets thrown at them, I'm not gonna throw a wiimote.

111
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:52,580
Rym: In fact, the only time a controller has ever in my life left My hand was through my own volition When I was playing a game that I will not name for the NES a long time ago and I threw the controller at the TV.

112
00:07:53,102 --> 00:07:55,190
Rym: It bounced off the TV and hit me in the foot.

113
00:07:55,471 --> 00:07:58,647
Scott: Yeah, but this you know, this thing is one-handed.

114
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,123
Scott: it doesn't have like a Handles in it.

115
00:08:01,163 --> 00:08:02,187
Scott: You don't have two hands on.

116
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:05,419
Scott: it could happen and it is happening to a lot of idiots out there.

117
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:14,188
Scott: Yeah People aren't using the whisk wrist strap and they're throwing the wiimotes into their TVs People are breaking the wrist strap.

118
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:18,040
Scott: Obviously if your wrist strap breaks is because you did not apply it properly.

119
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:24,760
Scott: You didn't slide that little piece of plastic down and you're putting strain on the little string instead of putting strain on the wrist strap.

120
00:08:25,122 --> 00:08:30,145
Rym: No, I could see it breaking also from people using something I like to call probably the most of it.

121
00:08:30,747 --> 00:08:34,500
Rym: This is like the underlying theme of tank police one of my favorite things.

122
00:08:35,022 --> 00:08:36,868
Rym: It's called excessive force.

123
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:40,279
Scott: Yes, if you there was a video of a guy.

124
00:08:41,163 --> 00:08:44,214
Scott: There was a video of a guy because it started out with just pictures.

125
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,600
Scott: people are like, oh you're faking it.

126
00:08:46,282 --> 00:08:51,440
Scott: Then there was a video of a guy doing we bowling and he threw the wiimote like against the wall.

127
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,464
Scott: But he was we bowling.

128
00:08:52,906 --> 00:08:56,560
Scott: if you watch again, you see just how hard this guy is swinging his arm.

129
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,410
Scott: You don't need to swing your arm that hard.

130
00:08:59,631 --> 00:08:59,872
Rym: Yeah.

131
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:07,760
Rym: In fact when I was playing we golf For a lot of the things I didn't bring my arms all the way up and swing like I was playing golf.

132
00:09:08,061 --> 00:09:10,591
Rym: I held it straight down and did this kind of wrist emotion.

133
00:09:10,892 --> 00:09:12,980
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's not really.

134
00:09:14,344 --> 00:09:19,574
Scott: It's really not necessary To swing it so hard that it could possibly break.

135
00:09:19,614 --> 00:09:25,220
Scott: if we're swinging it that hard You're swinging it harder than is possibly necessary.

136
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:32,300
Scott: You can get the maximum power in the game without swinging it with that much force and we're not saying you don't you know?

137
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:32,859
Rym: Get into it.

138
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:40,880
Rym: It's really fun when you're boxing or especially when you're playing tennis To kind of get into it and act like it's a real sport you're playing and that's really cool.

139
00:09:41,001 --> 00:09:43,499
Rym: In fact, you probably should do that to get the most enjoyment out of it.

140
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:47,271
Rym: But you don't need to swing your arm as hard as possible.

141
00:09:47,352 --> 00:09:49,177
Rym: You don't need to hyperextend your elbow.

142
00:09:49,197 --> 00:09:53,227
Scott: Yeah Necessary in fact dangerous.

143
00:09:53,247 --> 00:10:00,840
Rym: swinging something that hard when there's nothing in your hand to really be swinging That has weight is a great way to really hurt yourself.

144
00:10:01,443 --> 00:10:04,579
Scott: Yeah, and actually someone went and looked.

145
00:10:04,619 --> 00:10:09,300
Scott: you know All that annoying health and safety stuff that Nintendo's been putting on their products for a while.

146
00:10:10,241 --> 00:10:15,020
Scott: Yeah, well someone actually went and read that stuff to see what it says about this issue.

147
00:10:15,321 --> 00:10:21,865
Scott: And it says hold the wiimote firmly and do not let go Even while wearing the wrist strap.

148
00:10:21,906 --> 00:10:28,826
Scott: make sure you don't let go of the Wii remote during gameplay and do not use excessive motion For example in Wii Sports bowling.

149
00:10:28,847 --> 00:10:33,360
Scott: the proper way to let go of the ball while bowling is to release the B button on the Wii remote.

150
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,020
Scott: Do not let go of the Wii remote itself.

151
00:10:37,122 --> 00:10:41,799
Scott: If you are having so much fun that you start perspiring take a moment to dry your hands.

152
00:10:42,861 --> 00:10:49,541
Scott: If you use excessive motion and let go of the Wii remote the wrist strap may break and you could lose control of the Wii Remote.

153
00:10:50,102 --> 00:10:52,970
Scott: this could injure people nearby or cause damage to other objects.

154
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:56,640
Rym: Truer words have never been written into clay or stone.

155
00:10:57,022 --> 00:11:03,091
Scott: So a lot of people, you know, because this is happening a lot A lot of people are saying oh there's something wrong with the Wii remotes.

156
00:11:03,171 --> 00:11:05,018
Scott: The wrist straps are cheap, etc, etc, etc.

157
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:07,860
Scott: No, there's just a lot of idiots out there.

158
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:13,456
Scott: And if you break your Wii remote because you used it improperly or your TV breaks.

159
00:11:13,637 --> 00:11:14,620
Scott: I have no pity for you.

160
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,839
Rym: It's like that guy on dig a while ago who broke his fat DS.

161
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:24,800
Rym: Yeah, I can't imagine breaking my fat DS and I have dropped it onto hard concrete more than once.

162
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:33,839
Scott: Yeah, if you if your stuff breaks and other people have the same stuff doesn't have the same problem It's your fault and I don't feel sorry for you

163
00:11:34,181 --> 00:11:42,382
Rym: Yeah, like certain people who have slowly but surely bent our banana chairs backward about 20 degrees from what they were when we bought Them.

164
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:45,080
Scott: Yeah, we got to go find some higher quality banana chairs.

165
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:53,763
Rym: No, well, the thing is we probably should have warned everyone that the banana chairs they say very specifically you can't weigh more than 175 pounds.

166
00:11:54,085 --> 00:11:54,928
Scott: Yeah.

167
00:11:55,189 --> 00:11:55,690
Rym: Yeah.

168
00:11:55,771 --> 00:11:58,300
Rym: Yeah, we bought them for us cuz we're lanky dudes.

169
00:11:59,362 --> 00:12:00,689
Rym: They're made for kids guys.

170
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:01,232
Rym: Yeah.

171
00:12:01,252 --> 00:12:01,513
Scott: Okay.

172
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:02,720
Scott: What are the news is out there?

173
00:12:02,962 --> 00:12:05,400
Rym: Well this I don't even know who's doing it.

174
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,533
Rym: I don't really care cuz I'm not gonna talk about the actual site because I could care.

175
00:12:08,673 --> 00:12:11,942
Rym: I couldn't care less about the site But some people put together.

176
00:12:12,243 --> 00:12:12,663
Rym: help me.

177
00:12:12,683 --> 00:12:13,905
Rym: Am I I?

178
00:12:13,945 --> 00:12:17,149
Rym: you know me we there's a lot of people using the.

179
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:23,660
Rym: you know Anytime you have an e sound put two eyes in and make it a wee thing or try to make it a wee thing.

180
00:12:24,581 --> 00:12:48,291
Rym: And now that there's gonna be a web browser in the Wii as soon as they actually get that working and you can do it Without hacks, I think we're gonna see a trend of a lot of websites either Making well having a website specifically designed for use on the Wii Most often probably to provide something another website provides only in a we optimize fashion or else Content specifically for the Wii from companies.

181
00:12:48,472 --> 00:12:49,757
Rym: Maybe they'll have you pay for it.

182
00:12:49,818 --> 00:12:50,179
Rym: I don't know.

183
00:12:50,754 --> 00:12:57,392
Scott: Yeah I really hope they open it up to let a lot more people make me channel we channels because as it is There's not enough of those.

184
00:12:57,838 --> 00:13:03,040
Rym: Yeah Well, I imagine we're gonna see a lot of we channels and days to come weeks to come and months to come.

185
00:13:03,461 --> 00:13:12,325
Rym: But the web browser itself is gonna be a lot because I helped me is actually kind of this cool concept where they want to make this wiki kind of like game facts, but more of a Optimized.

186
00:13:12,405 --> 00:13:19,480
Rym: so from the Wii if you need help playing a game You pause the game go into this website and you can just kind of navigate through this wiki.

187
00:13:20,361 --> 00:13:23,880
Scott: That sounds you know, that's something really good because it's always annoying.

188
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,499
Scott: You know, you got a. you're having a problem in a video game.

189
00:13:26,861 --> 00:13:27,766
Scott: You need some help.

190
00:13:28,068 --> 00:13:30,460
Scott: You don't want to pay money to call the helpline.

191
00:13:30,822 --> 00:13:33,760
Scott: You don't want to call your friend and have them spoil the game or laugh at you.

192
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,098
Scott: You don't want anyone to know you're looking and you don't to pay for the ripoff strategy guys.

193
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,297
Rym: Well, obviously you use some sort of anonymizer and secretly go to game facts.

194
00:13:41,398 --> 00:13:41,900
Scott: exactly.

195
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:48,260
Scott: But you got to go upstairs or get a computer drag it over pause your game go to game facts search.

196
00:13:48,842 --> 00:13:49,785
Scott: You know, it's annoying.

197
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:51,129
Scott: be a lot cooler.

198
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:57,772
Scott: If you just you're playing the Wii you switch over to the web browser Check game facts without getting up and go back.

199
00:13:58,073 --> 00:13:59,960
Scott: make gamers a lot lazier a lot fatter.

200
00:14:00,221 --> 00:14:03,840
Rym: Yep, granted my policy with game facts is very simple.

201
00:14:03,941 --> 00:14:11,300
Rym: I rarely use game facts during a game But I often use it after I beat a game to find all the bullshit that wasn't worth finding.

202
00:14:11,861 --> 00:14:14,566
Rym: Well, I use ham Crystal Chronicles and all the bullshit.

203
00:14:14,726 --> 00:14:18,562
Scott: Yeah, I use game facts in three different ways.

204
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:26,270
Scott: the first way I use it is if an instruction manual is not complete or There's like some technique.

205
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:39,298
Scott: I'm supposed to know for a video game Usually a fighting game to learn special moves or you know like this I don't know how to play the game and I need the rules of the game, you know It's also good for Atari games because the manual doesn't exist anymore.

206
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:45,180
Scott: Yep Yeah And you want to know like what button does what or if it's possible to do something or if you do something in a game?

207
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,579
Scott: You're not sure how you did it.

208
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,322
Scott: You can look that up.

209
00:14:47,723 --> 00:14:57,600
Scott: the second way I use game facts is if I am stuck somewhere and it is arbitrarily Stupid stuck like no amount of thinking will get me out of it.

210
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,947
Scott: It's a. it's a knowledge problem.

211
00:14:58,967 --> 00:15:01,160
Scott: Like I do not know what I need to do next.

212
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,227
Scott: The game is a bad game.

213
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:04,170
Scott: it pretty much.

214
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:08,839
Scott: it only happens in bad games and most of the time I'll just stop playing the game if it happens.

215
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:12,953
Scott: But sometimes I might want to give it a little go especially if it's early.

216
00:15:13,073 --> 00:15:17,460
Scott: so I'll go on game facts and say alright How do I get past this really dumb part of the game?

217
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,329
Scott: that's impossible.

218
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:23,978
Scott: and The third time I'll use game facts is if I already beat a game and want to know where some secret is.

219
00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:36,680
Scott: or Like I don't know Maybe it'll be a part of the game where it says like collect the ten jammies and I found nine of the jammies and one Of them is still missing and it's a hide-and-seek thing and I don't really feel like looking around everywhere.

220
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,156
Scott: Yeah, or I've already looked everywhere and I haven't found the last gem.

221
00:15:40,216 --> 00:15:41,100
Scott: so I'll just go to game.

222
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:49,020
Rym: But in terms of actually going to game facts I'll play and I'll only go to game facts if I get frustrated enough to stop playing the game.

223
00:15:49,486 --> 00:16:01,660
Rym: Yes at that point I'm going up to my room anyway to be pissed off about the game for a while in which case I'm very likely to be On my computer complaining to someone about the game in which case there's a Firefox tab going to game facts.

224
00:16:03,601 --> 00:16:11,239
Scott: But I do not condone the use of strategy guides and facts and things to actually play games without having to you know play the game.

225
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,677
Scott: Yeah, it's like hey, I invented this robot.

226
00:16:14,697 --> 00:16:15,140
Scott: What does it do?

227
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:18,252
Scott: It plays quake 2 and beats the whole game perfectly.

228
00:16:18,653 --> 00:16:20,200
Scott: look well, that's great.

229
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:29,169
Rym: See granted sometimes strategy guys are cool like back in the day when Nintendo released those Crazy strategy guides for like Final Fantasy 1

230
00:16:29,169 --> 00:16:31,636
Scott: Mario 3 the cardboard one was the best

231
00:16:31,736 --> 00:16:36,378
Rym: because those were really actually Cool had a lot of neat stuff in and that had nothing to do with the game at all.

232
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:38,207
Scott: Yep, that was good stuff.

233
00:16:38,408 --> 00:16:40,800
Rym: and the Final Fantasy 1 one is to this day.

234
00:16:41,461 --> 00:16:51,240
Rym: I know where almost every major treasure is in that game like down to the chest or at least the room and I could pretty much play Final Fantasy 1 half with my eyes closed.

235
00:16:52,441 --> 00:16:53,229
Scott: That's great.

236
00:16:53,653 --> 00:16:54,360
Scott: Yeah, that's a real.

237
00:16:54,781 --> 00:17:01,517
Scott: I think there's really no point in a strategy like they try to sell you the strategy guide with the game And that just really I don't like it.

238
00:17:01,972 --> 00:17:03,426
Rym: Yeah That's a bad thing of course.

239
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,940
Rym: now games are designed a lot of them where you kind of need the strategy guide.

240
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,218
Scott: It's like looking at the answers to a crossword puzzle and then just filling it in.

241
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:16,118
Rym: What about the games where they want you to buy the strategy guide and there's a lot of arbitrary stuff You're really never gonna figure out.

242
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:21,780
Scott: I think there's a lot of companies that still they do that on purpose and like in a partnership with the strategy guide companies.

243
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:29,000
Scott: They put secrets in the game that you can't possibly know about without the strategy guide Just to sell you a strategy guide and make more money.

244
00:17:29,104 --> 00:17:31,186
Rym: Yeah like to get the special character.

245
00:17:31,206 --> 00:17:47,587
Rym: you have to go into this room and play this arbitrary sequence on the piano that you could have found out if you paid attention to what the nine cats in the world that you can't get to anymore because it was Destroyed said and then remember the correct order based on their color because they were all the colors of the rainbow But you might not have found all the cats now.

246
00:17:47,607 --> 00:17:48,129
Rym: It's too late.

247
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:48,791
Scott: Yep.

248
00:17:49,172 --> 00:17:50,898
Rym: That was an oddly specific example.

249
00:17:50,938 --> 00:18:02,391
Scott: I came up with Yeah, see usually though It's something arbitrary like if you go into this room and play this exact sequence on the piano That you have no way of possibly knowing without the strategy guy.

250
00:18:02,511 --> 00:18:03,977
Rym: I was thinking of Final Fantasy 7.

251
00:18:03,977 --> 00:18:04,680
Rym: What were you thinking of?

252
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,604
Rym: Arbitrariness, oh, okay.

253
00:18:07,885 --> 00:18:10,193
Rym: There's the thing in Final Fantasy 7 with the piano.

254
00:18:10,594 --> 00:18:15,030
Rym: Oh, of course, then there's the thing in Castlevania DS with the piano.

255
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,015
Scott: I'm gonna do anything.

256
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,605
Rym: I'm gonna save you all a lot of trouble.

257
00:18:18,947 --> 00:18:21,334
Rym: that piano room in Castlevania DS.

258
00:18:21,856 --> 00:18:23,120
Rym: Just get the fuck out of there.

259
00:18:23,441 --> 00:18:25,828
Rym: Don't worry about it doesn't do anything.

260
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:28,837
Rym: There is nothing to be found in that room at all.

261
00:18:29,258 --> 00:18:31,428
Scott: bad guys This is occasional bad guys there.

262
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,620
Rym: Yeah, there's like two succubuses flying in the air.

263
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,325
Scott: So just hit him with your whip and move on.

264
00:18:35,566 --> 00:18:36,890
Rym: Yeah, you don't have a whip.

265
00:18:37,352 --> 00:18:44,296
Rym: you might unless you're playing Julius mode Hit him with your axe spear sword, whatever you're you and I got the death scythe.

266
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:45,420
Rym: I'm all set in that game.

267
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,095
Rym: I'm playing through hard mode and I still just mow through the bosses without even blinking.

268
00:18:49,115 --> 00:18:50,260
Scott: Yeah, I'm not sure what weapon I had.

269
00:18:50,341 --> 00:18:51,316
Scott: Maybe I had the death scythe.

270
00:18:51,761 --> 00:18:53,184
Rym: It's the most powerful weapon in the game.

271
00:18:53,204 --> 00:18:58,860
Rym: you had to trade a boss's soul and upgrade the strongest acts to these super strongest acts.

272
00:18:59,161 --> 00:19:00,630
Scott: Yeah, I think I might have done that.

273
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:01,173
Scott: I'm not sure.

274
00:19:01,394 --> 00:19:14,523
Scott: Yeah anyway Things of the day Man, I love this thing of the day so much Really?

275
00:19:14,764 --> 00:19:15,145
Scott: Really?

276
00:19:15,426 --> 00:19:15,908
Rym: Which one?

277
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,312
Rym: Oh, I remember which one you're doing.

278
00:19:17,332 --> 00:19:19,319
Rym: You showed this to me about five minutes ago.

279
00:19:19,761 --> 00:19:25,258
Rym: Yep, actually more like a half hour ago because we just did the first half of the show, but I digress.

280
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:26,642
Scott: All right Yeah, yeah.

281
00:19:26,842 --> 00:19:27,083
Rym: Yeah.

282
00:19:27,123 --> 00:19:34,279
Rym: Well then I'll start with mine cuz mine is one we related and two not quite as good as yours, but very interesting.

283
00:19:35,223 --> 00:19:41,160
Rym: So there are guys and we know them and they're a lot like the guy in my thing of the day.

284
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:56,896
Rym: You see this is GeekNights and we're geeks and a lot of our listeners are geeks and some of our listeners are nerds And I think this guy is probably the epitome of not Nintendo geek not video game geek But Nintendo slash video game nerd.

285
00:19:56,916 --> 00:20:09,528
Rym: Oh this guy was waiting in line to get a Wii and he hadn't slept in five days and He admits that I think he was taking demerol and I really can't explain.

286
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:11,310
Rym: you just need to watch this guy.

287
00:20:12,261 --> 00:20:24,446
Scott: good, I've seen guys like this at conventions and comic book stores at all sorts of Nerdly events of sorts and he is not out of the ordinary But he is scary.

288
00:20:24,668 --> 00:20:25,813
Scott: and there are others like him.

289
00:20:25,894 --> 00:20:28,022
Scott: beware lately I've been pretty much.

290
00:20:28,082 --> 00:20:35,605
Scott: I've been really into these small-time RPGs, you know these I Don't know how to explain them but well, you don't play him or anything.

291
00:20:35,726 --> 00:20:36,530
Scott: I haven't played him yet.

292
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:38,290
Scott: No, I think well, I played kobolds at my baby.

293
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,815
Scott: I think that counts as one.

294
00:20:39,936 --> 00:21:16,808
Scott: but you know that these little tiny RPGs that come in really small books They have really focused like settings, you know It'll be like this is an RPG where you're a bunch of guys who do this specific kind of thing, you know They're not the kind of RPGs that you can have vast Multi-session campaigns with there, you know one time at a convention funfests anyway most of these RPGs have something in common and that is the character sheets are really well designed and they kind of fit the game and They usually have all sorts of neat stuff on them and they're actually sort of exciting and fun to look at.

295
00:21:17,691 --> 00:21:22,683
Scott: so one guy who knows this made up a little contest and the contact.

296
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:37,047
Scott: the contest is called reverse engineer and The way the contest works is he gave people two weeks to make a character sheet for a game that doesn't exist and send it in and a lot of people made character sheets and sent them in.

297
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:44,862
Scott: and It's pretty cool because you can go to this website and look at a bunch of character sheets That were just made for games that don't exist.

298
00:21:44,922 --> 00:21:46,750
Scott: Some of them are kind of crazy.

299
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:48,777
Scott: Some of them aren't so crazy.

300
00:21:48,877 --> 00:21:50,764
Scott: Some of them are obviously good.

301
00:21:50,884 --> 00:21:52,390
Scott: Some of them are not so good.

302
00:21:52,872 --> 00:21:56,770
Scott: The best one is one created by Martin O'Leary.

303
00:21:56,992 --> 00:22:01,315
Scott: So if you go to this website, just look on the left hand side There's a frame with a bunch of names in it.

304
00:22:01,656 --> 00:22:06,110
Scott: find the name Martin O'Leary and click on it and it'll bring you to what?

305
00:22:06,771 --> 00:22:09,002
Scott: I say is the best character sheet of the lot.

306
00:22:09,364 --> 00:22:12,749
Rym: now he can describe it But you're really better off seeing this bad boy.

307
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:21,229
Scott: All I can say is the top of the character sheet says in Soviet Russia character sheet designs you Those stats at the bottom right now.

308
00:22:21,931 --> 00:22:28,970
Scott: He then gave people two weeks to take one of the character sheets and make a game based on the character sheet.

309
00:22:29,191 --> 00:22:31,810
Rym: You know reverse engineering the character sheet exactly.

310
00:22:32,432 --> 00:22:36,810
Scott: So, you know not the same person who made the character sheet made the game, you know.

311
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:40,330
Scott: So if I made a character sheet someone else would make the game for it.

312
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,133
Scott: So it's kind of weird.

313
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:59,410
Scott: the guy who took this awesome character sheet made by Martin O'Leary His name was Nathan D Pauletta and the game he made was called is called Vesna thaw and the sub the subtitle is post apocalyptic community building in a post Soviet world.

314
00:22:59,972 --> 00:23:04,130
Scott: Let me tell you this is an awesome game and it is Creative Commons license.

315
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:12,749
Scott: I didn't actually read all the rules of the game So it might not be a playable game, but it from what I have read of the rules It isn't entertaining to read the rules.

316
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:19,210
Rym: It is probably a lot like Hall which is pretty much the epitome of games that you read the rule book and laugh about.

317
00:23:19,571 --> 00:23:22,200
Rym: But God help your soul if you decide to try and play.

318
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,267
Scott: I think this one might be playable one time.

319
00:23:24,288 --> 00:23:27,934
Rym: I Highly doubt that Kobolds ate.

320
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:30,403
Rym: my baby is barely playable.

321
00:23:30,483 --> 00:23:36,050
Scott: even once it's playable once Barely, it's as long as you have new people every time it's played.

322
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:36,592
Rym: I'll take.

323
00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:42,190
Rym: my baby is able to keep my attention for approximately six minutes and that includes character creation.

324
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,253
Scott: You just don't want it.

325
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:46,644
Rym: Maybe just that you shouldn't be running Kobolds ate my baby.

326
00:23:46,664 --> 00:23:50,950
Rym: Yeah, anyway That was a bad experience.

327
00:23:51,893 --> 00:23:53,649
Scott: You know you guys didn't exactly help me out.

328
00:23:54,031 --> 00:23:58,050
Scott: We tried we tried and you were like you were trying to ruin the game for the start.

329
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,365
Rym: What do you did if you've been trying to ruin the game?

330
00:24:00,385 --> 00:24:00,929
Rym: is you know?

331
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:07,150
Rym: Interacting with the world in a realistic cobalt way and trying to do things like I see a chicken I attacked the chicken.

332
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,358
Rym: Yeah, we were trying to ruin it.

333
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,486
Rym: whoa the DM can't deal with it.

334
00:24:11,526 --> 00:24:13,914
Rym: if I attack the chicken What do we do now?

335
00:24:13,934 --> 00:24:15,238
Scott: I was dealing with it.

336
00:24:15,258 --> 00:24:15,760
Scott: Just fun.

337
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,763
Rym: Yeah by killing us.

338
00:24:17,144 --> 00:24:19,210
Rym: Yeah, I try to take the chicken you die.

339
00:24:19,331 --> 00:24:21,269
Scott: What that's what says in the book.

340
00:24:21,772 --> 00:24:24,643
Rym: I will say it wasn't the worst role-playing experience of my life.

341
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:30,786
Rym: that falls squarely on the time I tried to DM a system that my friend can had written.

342
00:24:30,806 --> 00:24:38,062
Rym: Oh God The system wasn't done yet and they were playing with it a lot and I didn't understand the system and didn't read it very much.

343
00:24:38,688 --> 00:24:48,426
Rym: and He had also provided me with a basic plot and a bunch of characters and I kind of just manhandled them all together And it was without question the worst role-playing the world has ever seen.

344
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,210
Rym: it was awesome.

345
00:24:49,732 --> 00:24:53,827
Scott: I'm gonna try to play inspectors at some point in the future and we'll see how it goes.

346
00:24:54,048 --> 00:24:54,590
Rym: Yeah, we will.

347
00:24:54,871 --> 00:24:56,056
Scott: Yeah, either way.

348
00:24:56,116 --> 00:24:57,422
Scott: This is an awesome website.

349
00:24:57,463 --> 00:24:59,070
Scott: There's a lot of funny character sheets.

350
00:24:59,492 --> 00:25:01,222
Scott: It will entertain you for a long time.

351
00:25:01,242 --> 00:25:05,808
Rym: if you are a fan of RPGs And if you've maxed out your Vodak score.

352
00:25:05,949 --> 00:25:08,979
Scott: well Yeah, if you max out the Vodak you are the win.

353
00:25:09,621 --> 00:25:16,270
Rym: and if you don't know what Vodak is welcome to the internet Actually, no, cuz that's kind of an obscure and stupid thing.

354
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:18,050
Rym: So don't worry if you don't know what Vodak is.

355
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:21,281
Rym: In fact, if you don't know what Vodak is or why that's funny.

356
00:25:21,542 --> 00:25:23,429
Rym: You're probably a better person than I am.

357
00:25:24,011 --> 00:25:25,840
Scott: I'm gonna search for Vodak on Google.

358
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,194
Rym: It's really right now real-time Live GeekNights.

359
00:25:29,615 --> 00:25:30,518
Rym: I got to keep talking.

360
00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:31,741
Scott: Oh, okay.

361
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:34,910
Scott: No, you'll if you search on Google, you'll you'll get it really.

362
00:25:35,151 --> 00:25:45,670
Scott: yes, I've never searched for that because the The top link is the urban dictionary which will tell you what Vodak is and it correctly tells you what Vodak is.

363
00:25:45,951 --> 00:25:59,902
Rym: You know, it's sad and scary that I've been not only on the internet long enough But reading Fark long enough to where I've seen the birth Rise Fall and death of numerous fart cliches in the course of my time here.

364
00:26:00,384 --> 00:26:02,889
Rym: the haha guy appeared while I was a Farker.

365
00:26:03,632 --> 00:26:06,847
Scott: Okay, wait, there are three definitions for Vodak free.

366
00:26:07,168 --> 00:26:12,746
Scott: Yep The first one is I'll let everyone in on what Vodak is.

367
00:26:12,766 --> 00:26:13,790
Scott: All right, I'll give it away.

368
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:29,488
Scott: The first definition for Vodak according to the urban dictionary, which is the only dictionary in which you will find Vodak Vodka as spelled after consuming insufficient quantities to further proof that even the most idiotic brain fart can become a meme.

369
00:26:29,528 --> 00:26:37,686
Scott: and three Leetness incarnate Vodak plus God Wow, yep.

370
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:52,195
Rym: Anyway today we decided because we haven't been role-playing a lot lately though You will have quite a number of role-playing and Dungeons & Dragons Centric Tuesdays to come as Starting this weekend.

371
00:26:52,215 --> 00:26:55,670
Rym: We are doing something we haven't done since college.

372
00:26:56,031 --> 00:27:04,810
Rym: We are getting the group back together and running a gigantic monthly D&D campaign The likes of which we haven't seen since well college.

373
00:27:05,592 --> 00:27:06,856
Scott: We'll see how this work granted.

374
00:27:06,896 --> 00:27:10,045
Rym: It's not like college where we played every weekend.

375
00:27:10,466 --> 00:27:14,942
Rym: Yeah sort of out of habit Yeah, but at the same time we're kind of getting a fresh start.

376
00:27:15,263 --> 00:27:17,030
Rym: We're trying a lot of new things.

377
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:22,870
Rym: We're bringing back some things that we've kind of lost sight of over the years and I think this is gonna be a great time.

378
00:27:24,735 --> 00:27:27,470
Scott: Yeah, it definitely beats a change which is what I'm looking for.

379
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:33,150
Rym: Well, you're all gonna get the play-by-play of us getting back into role-playing after a couple year hiatus.

380
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:46,978
Rym: I mean not counting our forum games and all that but regular in-person D&D sessions with something that we haven't had in our D&D For pretty much since I was in high school The table Oh Noah's.

381
00:27:47,138 --> 00:27:50,870
Rym: yeah, we're gonna play around a table instead of lounging all around a room.

382
00:27:51,811 --> 00:27:52,133
Scott: All right.

383
00:27:52,514 --> 00:27:54,944
Rym: Yeah, but today since this will probably be the last chance.

384
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:58,761
Rym: We'll get to talk about it for a while We're gonna talk about the Wii and review a Wii game.

385
00:27:59,102 --> 00:27:59,604
Scott: Oh my god.

386
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:00,870
Scott: Well we game we gonna review.

387
00:28:01,031 --> 00:28:07,476
Rym: Well, we could review excite truck, but there's not much to say other than drive a truck really fast And the controls are pretty cool.

388
00:28:07,958 --> 00:28:08,380
Scott: It's pretty good.

389
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,870
Scott: Yeah, I think I'll go play some after the week to the show.

390
00:28:11,372 --> 00:28:12,054
Rym: I'd have to join you.

391
00:28:12,436 --> 00:28:12,938
Scott: It's 10/11.

392
00:28:12,938 --> 00:28:24,759
Rym: Yeah, it's 10/11 for those of you who listen to GeekNights time-shifted Which is everyone in the world except when Alex or Emily is in the house listening to us while we're doing 10 11 p.m So yeah, so it's a GeekNights for sure.

393
00:28:24,899 --> 00:28:25,160
Rym: Yes.

394
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,904
Scott: That's 22 11 for you 24 hour clock people.

395
00:28:26,984 --> 00:28:30,469
Rym: Oh Fancy.

396
00:28:31,531 --> 00:28:35,187
Rym: So we're gonna review probably the most basic game for the Wii.

397
00:28:35,629 --> 00:28:37,938
Scott: wait I think you don't need to say it cuz people guessed already.

398
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,087
Rym: Yeah, we're gonna review the me system.

399
00:28:40,729 --> 00:28:44,295
Scott: Oh Oh Yeah, these are pretty fun.

400
00:28:44,476 --> 00:28:45,840
Scott: People can't get enough of making them.

401
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,710
Rym: Yeah, even Stephen Colbert is all about the Mies.

402
00:28:49,235 --> 00:28:49,759
Scott: Yeah, all right.

403
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,890
Scott: No, we're gonna talk about Wii Sports.

404
00:28:50,911 --> 00:28:52,534
Rym: It's a good thing We're not talking about the Mies.

405
00:28:52,574 --> 00:28:57,150
Rym: cuz I got a fucking rant about one thing that really you can't get a unibrow.

406
00:28:57,873 --> 00:28:59,710
Rym: No, I can't get a unibrow, but I can deal with that.

407
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,095
Rym: You see I made my me.

408
00:29:01,618 --> 00:29:04,630
Rym: anyone who shared the friend code with us might see my me.

409
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:10,820
Rym: Oh, right My me looks in fact a lot like me like, you know Some people their me looks kind of like him.

410
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,589
Rym: some people's little off some people's really good.

411
00:29:13,113 --> 00:29:15,029
Rym: My me is the spitting image of me.

412
00:29:15,813 --> 00:29:21,419
Rym: It's other than the fact that I don't wear purple shirts and my stomach isn't round like that But no one's stomach is right.

413
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:25,709
Rym: Well some people have one person one man in all the world.

414
00:29:26,455 --> 00:29:27,947
Rym: Yeah, we won't say his name.

415
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:45,481
Rym: Yeah, so now for those of you who know me I used to have a unibrow and a Rather austere and somewhat large mustache a mustache moustache In fact, my dad waxed his a couple times.

416
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:47,650
Rym: I could have waxed mine.

417
00:29:48,514 --> 00:29:51,570
Rym: I could have easily grown my mustache to the point that I could have waxed it.

418
00:29:51,933 --> 00:29:54,469
Rym: It grows back in about a week That's right.

419
00:29:54,971 --> 00:30:04,049
Rym: But I decided partly due to something that our friend Yuko and our friend Emily drew on the fridge to make classic Rym with the unibrow and the mustache.

420
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:11,203
Rym: and The easiest way to do this I thought would be to you know Make a look a copy my me and just change those two parameters.

421
00:30:11,725 --> 00:30:12,829
Rym: You can't copy a me.

422
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:25,207
Rym: Furthermore if you think you're smart and you want to be clever and you think oh, I'll copy my me to the wiimote I'll edit the one in the plaza change its name and everything and then bring the other one back.

423
00:30:25,769 --> 00:30:29,530
Rym: No Nintendo is all about not letting you do that.

424
00:30:29,671 --> 00:30:33,370
Rym: It knows that it's the same me and it overwrites the me you've got in the plaza.

425
00:30:35,611 --> 00:30:37,055
Scott: Yeah, it was kind of annoying.

426
00:30:37,176 --> 00:30:41,529
Rym: me's have some sort of hidden internal identifier that you can't change or get rid of.

427
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,114
Rym: Yeah, so be warned.

428
00:30:43,516 --> 00:30:45,361
Rym: Anyway, no, we're talking about Wii Sports.

429
00:30:45,722 --> 00:30:48,190
Scott: All right, she just go to the sports down in a row.

430
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:49,436
Rym: I think we should.

431
00:30:49,476 --> 00:30:54,756
Rym: we'll start with tennis because that's the simplest Wii Sport and Probably the easiest one to review.

432
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:55,218
Rym: Yep.

433
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,267
Scott: It's also one I suck at.

434
00:30:57,448 --> 00:31:00,522
Rym: apparently I'll give it a six or seven out of ten.

435
00:31:00,543 --> 00:31:02,130
Scott: Yeah, it sounds about right.

436
00:31:02,231 --> 00:31:12,890
Scott: I mean the main problem with tennis is that you know Granted none of the Wii Sports are going to be as full as say, you know a real like Mario tennis.

437
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:16,310
Scott: Yeah, well, it's a very simplified dumbed-down version of tennis.

438
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:21,450
Scott: The thing is it is dumbed down more than any of the other games.

439
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:30,118
Rym: well, the thing you got to remember our Wii Sports is that it is really a tech demo and Something to make the Wii more.

440
00:31:30,499 --> 00:31:33,870
Rym: I guess you feel better about buying it because it comes with his game.

441
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:36,980
Scott: Well also it's to help you learn to use the wiimote.

442
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,144
Scott: Yes comfortable with it.

443
00:31:38,424 --> 00:31:40,130
Rym: And of course it uses the me's.

444
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,278
Rym: It's the only game that uses the me's so far.

445
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:45,210
Rym: So otherwise the me's wouldn't have felt so useful.

446
00:31:45,774 --> 00:31:47,770
Scott: No, they would have been kind of silly without Wii Sports.

447
00:31:47,891 --> 00:31:52,785
Scott: It actually makes me sports a lot of fun to see all the me's in there Like my dad gets up to bat in baseball.

448
00:31:52,805 --> 00:31:53,530
Scott: It's pretty hilarious.

449
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:56,607
Rym: Or Harris is in the background talking to classic Brian.

450
00:31:56,848 --> 00:32:03,580
Scott: Yeah No, but tennis okay the tennis game basically the ball.

451
00:32:03,841 --> 00:32:04,683
Scott: it comes at you.

452
00:32:05,084 --> 00:32:05,264
Scott: you

453
00:32:05,364 --> 00:32:05,806
Scott: swing

454
00:32:05,866 --> 00:32:07,490
Scott: the wiimote you hit the ball

455
00:32:07,791 --> 00:32:08,473
Scott: Continue now

456
00:32:08,513 --> 00:32:08,874
Rym: remember

457
00:32:08,955 --> 00:32:09,256
Scott: you don't

458
00:32:09,296 --> 00:32:10,360
Rym: control the dudes.

459
00:32:10,741 --> 00:32:12,427
Rym: It's doubles and there's two guys that you said.

460
00:32:12,447 --> 00:32:25,430
Rym: you don't control the dudes You just control the swing and the whole game is very simply Timing your swing to hit the ball and Hitting the ball in the right direction to make it harder for the other person to hit the ball and also getting the ball.

461
00:32:25,812 --> 00:32:29,390
Scott: You know in the keeping it in the court, you don't want to hit it out into the stand.

462
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,597
Rym: I think that falls under hitting it in the right direction.

463
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:34,126
Rym: Yeah captain out of the USS out.

464
00:32:34,366 --> 00:32:35,490
Scott: Yeah, I am captain out.

465
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:39,670
Scott: I just tried to do the tennis training mode where you know, you practice your tennis skills.

466
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:45,127
Scott: Yeah And the first mode is this girl hits a ball to your side and all you have to do is hit it back.

467
00:32:45,668 --> 00:32:50,145
Scott: and I was Able to hit six in a row and that was my record most of the time.

468
00:32:50,185 --> 00:32:51,370
Scott: I couldn't hit the first one bag.

469
00:32:51,931 --> 00:33:13,510
Rym: See, I'll tell you right now what your problem is with getting it out because how you hit the ball is not as Intense or important as say bowling but in terms of actually, you know hit it to the left hit it to the right hit it up a little bit hit it down the wiimote nose and You were hitting it to the left when your guy was already to the left and that's why it went out of bounds.

470
00:33:14,472 --> 00:33:16,078
Scott: I keep hitting it way to the left.

471
00:33:16,138 --> 00:33:17,202
Scott: I can't seem to hit it straight.

472
00:33:17,303 --> 00:33:18,166
Scott: It's just like in bowling.

473
00:33:18,206 --> 00:33:19,150
Scott: I can't bowl straight.

474
00:33:19,991 --> 00:33:21,498
Rym: I think you need to strengthen your wrists.

475
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,487
Scott: No, it's like I'm hold.

476
00:33:23,547 --> 00:33:25,750
Scott: It's not a man It's a matter of too strong wrist.

477
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:26,191
Scott: I can't.

478
00:33:26,372 --> 00:33:31,590
Rym: I'm trying to do less wrist action not more but you need a strong wrist to hold your wrist ready while doing something.

479
00:33:31,731 --> 00:33:33,839
Scott: I am I'm holding it dead steady, but I don't know.

480
00:33:33,859 --> 00:33:35,084
Rym: Well, apparently you're not.

481
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:37,118
Scott: I don't know what it is I don't know.

482
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:42,570
Scott: I'll have to do it slow I think the other thing is I'm trying to do stuff too quick and I could do it slower with the same effect.

483
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:45,456
Rym: Yeah, yeah Now the thing is like all.

484
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:46,519
Rym: we are early.

485
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,984
Rym: we we sports type games.

486
00:33:48,386 --> 00:33:49,630
Rym: you can play it two ways.

487
00:33:49,932 --> 00:33:58,350
Rym: You can stand there and swing it like you're swinging a tennis racket Or you can just kind of twitch your hand and just kind of know what gestures make it go.

488
00:33:58,612 --> 00:33:59,964
Scott: Yeah, you can do the toolbox.

489
00:34:00,429 --> 00:34:03,410
Rym: now You can do the toolbox and the game works just fine.

490
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:09,130
Rym: But the boat the best way to enjoy this game is to get four people standing your living room and get really into it.

491
00:34:09,371 --> 00:34:11,623
Scott: It's really the problem I have with we.

492
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:12,567
Scott: tennis is two things.

493
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:18,909
Scott: number one They should have let you move your we guy around with the nunchuck thing instead of having a move automatically.

494
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:22,081
Rym: That might have made the game a little too complex.

495
00:34:22,121 --> 00:34:24,370
Scott: I don't think it would have made it too complex for this early.

496
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,889
Rym: So I'm sure there's going to be a tennis game that does that.

497
00:34:27,292 --> 00:34:34,763
Scott: I'm sure there is going to be almost certainly Mario tennis most likely but or Virtua tennis if they make that for the week, but you know, it would.

498
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:36,590
Scott: it would still been a dumbed-down tennis.

499
00:34:36,811 --> 00:34:40,610
Scott: It would have just been you know worth playing more than a few times.

500
00:34:41,473 --> 00:34:43,110
Rym: I don't know because I find the tennis really fun.

501
00:34:43,271 --> 00:34:47,850
Scott: Yeah, the other problem I have with the tennis the bigger problem is actually that you can't play singles.

502
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:49,074
Scott: It's doubles only.

503
00:34:49,214 --> 00:34:59,150
Rym: so even if you play one-on-one it gives you two of the same guy on your side Which is kind of cool still because now you have this thing of do I hit with the front guy or the back guy?

504
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:02,220
Rym: And that's a very important strategic decision it is.

505
00:35:02,341 --> 00:35:05,954
Scott: but at the same time I'd like to play singles, you know I don't want to have two guys there.

506
00:35:06,095 --> 00:35:09,670
Rym: Yeah, I guess I'm not asking much of Wii Sports cuz it was free.

507
00:35:10,352 --> 00:35:14,083
Scott: Yeah, I don't as much of it either but you know the the time comparing.

508
00:35:14,203 --> 00:35:18,010
Scott: if you compare the sports to each other Tennis is not the best one.

509
00:35:18,262 --> 00:35:25,330
Rym: No However, it is the quickest one the easiest one to get into the easiest one to enjoy and it requires the least effort or care.

510
00:35:25,573 --> 00:35:26,610
Scott: Yeah, that is for sure.

511
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:26,851
Scott: You know.

512
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:31,075
Scott: if you just want to pick up the Wii swing it around for a few minutes and put it back Tennis is your.

513
00:35:31,135 --> 00:35:32,120
Scott: tennis is what you're going for.

514
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:32,361
Rym: Yep.

515
00:35:32,602 --> 00:35:33,567
Rym: I really like the tennis.

516
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:35,179
Scott: All right What comes after the tennis?

517
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,270
Scott: Well, that would be baseball.

518
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,373
Scott: Oh the baseball.

519
00:35:37,394 --> 00:35:47,876
Scott: see the thing with the baseball right is the hitting is actually a whole lot of fun, but the pitching while Fun, it doesn't use the wiimote as much as it could now in

520
00:35:47,918 --> 00:35:55,132
Rym: fact The pitching instead of what you might expect where you swing the wiimote to the left or right to put a curve on the ball Or any of that.

521
00:35:55,533 --> 00:36:12,009
Rym: it's mostly you swing it and that just initiates the pitch and before you swing You can hit on the direction pad up down left to right to say which direction you want the ball to go and you can Kind of do it behind your back like you're holding a baseball because when you hit it, it rumbles a little to say Yeah, I got your hit.

522
00:36:12,562 --> 00:36:22,730
Rym: I know you've set your kind of pitch and then while you pitch you either don't hold any buttons hold a hold B or hold a and B and each of those combinations throws a different kind of pitch.

523
00:36:23,031 --> 00:36:37,458
Scott: so there are four kinds of pitches you can throw and you set where the pitch where you're trying to throw it before you throw and Then when you swing the wiimote All you're really doing is saying how hard you want to pitch it If you want to throw a slow ball or a fastball

524
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,874
Rym: and I haven't noticed much difference no matter how hard or slow I move it.

525
00:36:40,934 --> 00:36:42,850
Scott: Well, no pretty I've noticed a difference.

526
00:36:42,971 --> 00:36:49,241
Scott: I'm able to throw like a slow medium and fast pitches pretty much, you know It's either 60 miles an hour 80 or 90 something.

527
00:36:49,342 --> 00:36:55,670
Rym: now The batting is a lot more fun, even though it's not nearly as difficult as you might expect.

528
00:36:55,770 --> 00:37:03,437
Scott: Yeah, the batting pretty much all there is to the batting is you either don't swing because the pitch is a ball and you don't Want to strike out.

529
00:37:03,658 --> 00:37:04,322
Rym: though be warned.

530
00:37:04,342 --> 00:37:05,569
Rym: The strike zone is pretty big.

531
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,058
Scott: It is a pretty big strike zone.

532
00:37:08,078 --> 00:37:11,450
Scott: or you swing at the right time in order to get a hit.

533
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:18,090
Scott: If you swing at the wrong time, you're gonna hit it foul or get a kind of like the old baseball simulator games.

534
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:20,770
Scott: Yeah, so it's swing the bat with the right, you know.

535
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:25,950
Scott: Well, you can actually swing the bat slowly to get you know or take or faster to get more power on it.

536
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:26,955
Rym: yeah, and you can also.

537
00:37:27,116 --> 00:37:36,789
Rym: I'm pretty sure that if you give it kind of a Upward tilt like if you're trying to hit a real home run at the end It seems that I get more home runs when I do that.

538
00:37:36,951 --> 00:37:39,090
Rym: Yeah, but I can't say if the game knows or not.

539
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:45,106
Scott: I don't know that for sure, but if you swing the bat at the right time and you swing it quickly enough That's how you get the big hits.

540
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:50,130
Rym: now The timing to hit is actually very difficult to get right especially when the pitcher can change.

541
00:37:50,411 --> 00:37:57,969
Scott: Yeah, I mean if someone if you just play the training mode where they throw you nice easy pitches over and over again You can learn to hit the ball.

542
00:37:58,451 --> 00:38:06,410
Scott: But as soon as you play against a real person they keep throwing all sorts of different pitches different speeds And you know you have no idea what they're throwing.

543
00:38:06,571 --> 00:38:11,428
Scott: It gets very difficult and the pitchers really have an advantage and the games are very low.

544
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:11,850
Scott: scoring.

545
00:38:11,991 --> 00:38:13,889
Rym: Yeah, the game we just played a little while ago.

546
00:38:14,476 --> 00:38:21,206
Rym: I got up by one Crazily with a home run and then a little while later Scott got up by one with two runs.

547
00:38:21,768 --> 00:38:23,529
Rym: and other than that It was mostly strikeouts.

548
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:26,561
Scott: Yeah, mostly strikeouts a lot of ground outs.

549
00:38:26,581 --> 00:38:35,974
Scott: because if you yeah, and then if you don't hit a foul ball someone in the field if it's not like a big hit someone in the field is gonna touch the ball and then you're out because There's no fielding.

550
00:38:36,396 --> 00:38:37,942
Scott: and I don't I don't think that's a problem.

551
00:38:38,002 --> 00:38:39,027
Scott: It was just pitching and hitting.

552
00:38:39,047 --> 00:38:39,850
Scott: you don't need fielding.

553
00:38:40,292 --> 00:38:42,782
Scott: That would be too difficult with the wiimote in this kind of game.

554
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,810
Rym: Yeah, I'd give the game again a six or seven.

555
00:38:45,391 --> 00:38:50,790
Scott: Yeah, I think I like it more than the tennis But at the same time it's not as good as some of the other Wii Sports games.

556
00:38:51,182 --> 00:38:53,418
Rym: Yeah But it's a tech demo kind of gives the positive.

557
00:38:53,719 --> 00:39:00,229
Rym: the one nice thing is that when you're standing there ready to bat and you Move the wiimote the bat moves pretty much perfectly on your guy.

558
00:39:00,511 --> 00:39:09,516
Scott: Yeah, cuz you know when I play actual baseball, you know, I like to you know We'll do a little shake the bat around up near the back of my head, you know And I can do that with the wiimote.

559
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:17,470
Rym: and that makes me feel really comfortable because it's a lot more like real batting plus I gotta say and as silly as it sounds having those Mies makes it so much more fun.

560
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:31,830
Rym: yeah, because Scott Johnson hit a home run and Our friend Yuko saved me by catching a ball and putting Scott I gotta say the Mies have the best effect in baseball because even though you're playing only two people are playing.

561
00:39:32,114 --> 00:39:38,010
Scott: Let's let's say I'm playing Rym That means I'm the pitcher and he's the pitcher and we're both at the top of our respective lineups.

562
00:39:38,512 --> 00:39:42,670
Scott: But all the other Mies that are on our system fill out the rest of the playing field.

563
00:39:43,611 --> 00:39:44,173
Scott: You know, it's.

564
00:39:44,273 --> 00:39:45,999
Scott: it's fun to see your friends come up to bat.

565
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,130
Rym: So Emily or James or Lisa Harris will come up.

566
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:53,622
Scott: It's like my dad will be on second and then you know friend James.

567
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:55,247
Scott: It's a home run and brings him in.

568
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:56,290
Scott: It's good stuff.

569
00:39:57,932 --> 00:40:02,734
Rym: Yeah, yeah, so moving right along I guess we could hit up on golf Which I really like.

570
00:40:03,436 --> 00:40:08,290
Scott: the golf actually is one of the better Wii games because it's it's a lot more of an actual game.

571
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:09,174
Scott: I'm not good at it.

572
00:40:09,697 --> 00:40:11,365
Scott: But at the same time it's it's.

573
00:40:11,485 --> 00:40:12,289
Scott: it's actually pretty good.

574
00:40:12,731 --> 00:40:24,354
Rym: Yeah, it's basically a straight-up game where you can choose between you know, a driver and iron a wedge and a putter Mm-hmm, and it shows a little mini-map where you can see and this is the real thing I think is really neat.

575
00:40:24,796 --> 00:40:27,550
Rym: you can point which direction you want to go and it shows a mini-map.

576
00:40:28,132 --> 00:40:38,090
Rym: It shows the direction of the wind relative to where you're about to hit and it shows the line extending from your character Over this mini-map and it'll have like white dot white dot white dot yellow diamond.

577
00:40:38,653 --> 00:40:44,570
Rym: Now when you swing and you can do as many practice swings as you want that don't do anything Like you're standing next to the tee not swinging at the ball.

578
00:40:45,292 --> 00:41:02,270
Rym: it has a power bar above you that goes white dot white dot white dot diamond and However hard you swing determines a little power bar that shows how hard you're gonna hit it and say you get the little blue Power bar to go up two of the white dots then the ball is gonna land just at the second dot

579
00:41:02,853 --> 00:41:03,576
Scott: Pretty close to it.

580
00:41:03,616 --> 00:41:04,360
Scott: It's not exact.

581
00:41:04,701 --> 00:41:06,510
Scott: There's a lot of other factors that come into it.

582
00:41:07,815 --> 00:41:09,241
Scott: And wind and speed.

583
00:41:09,261 --> 00:41:11,610
Rym: remember I'm talking about the first land before it bounces.

584
00:41:11,972 --> 00:41:17,540
Rym: Yeah, yeah, and if there's no wind for which is Craig This is almost always wind and you get exactly two dots.

585
00:41:17,661 --> 00:41:20,250
Rym: It'll land with the first bounce at exactly two dots.

586
00:41:20,813 --> 00:41:23,890
Scott: Yeah about I mean, there's some other factors that come into it.

587
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:30,150
Scott: Like if you use the the driver, the ball is sort of more likely to keep going, you know.

588
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:33,442
Scott: And if you use the iron, it probably just comes and plops down.

589
00:41:33,462 --> 00:41:35,189
Scott: it matters a little bit.

590
00:41:35,229 --> 00:41:38,742
Rym: But yeah Well, I was at the first bounce will be exactly there unless there's wind.

591
00:41:39,324 --> 00:41:42,073
Scott: Yeah, if you do it exactly right That's what I said.

592
00:41:42,093 --> 00:41:44,981
Scott: It's never actually lands exactly there.

593
00:41:45,001 --> 00:41:46,766
Rym: That's because there's usually wind.

594
00:41:46,826 --> 00:41:52,969
Scott: Yeah, but it's a very good Way to you know that you know how hard to swing without actually having to gauge it.

595
00:41:53,170 --> 00:42:02,730
Rym: Now the cool thing is if you swing too hard, you can send the ball a lot further But it'll hook or slice and sometimes it won't either and you you can't really control that.

596
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:12,930
Rym: But you can often use that to your advantage to hit the ball a lot further than you needed to, you know Or hope for a slice and aim in the wrong direction and just hit it really hard.

597
00:42:13,372 --> 00:42:20,790
Rym: And if you time it right and you get it right and all the luck's with you You might get the ball way farther than you could have by playing correctly.

598
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:26,226
Scott: Yeah on some of the simpler holes that actually is a really good tactic is to just freakin.

599
00:42:26,266 --> 00:42:30,040
Scott: who cares about you know Screwing it over and going way off the meter freaking.

600
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,325
Scott: hit the ball as hard as you can.

601
00:42:31,747 --> 00:42:32,851
Scott: It'll get farther You'll.

602
00:42:33,031 --> 00:42:38,127
Scott: you'll maybe save a stroke but on the harder holes if you don't hit it exactly, right?

603
00:42:38,187 --> 00:42:39,994
Scott: It's going out of bounds It's going in the water.

604
00:42:40,034 --> 00:42:42,084
Scott: It's going in the sand and that's not gonna be good.

605
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:43,090
Scott: That's gonna be real bad.

606
00:42:43,573 --> 00:42:45,629
Rym: Yeah captain out of bounds.

607
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:45,814
Rym: Yeah.

608
00:42:46,511 --> 00:43:00,893
Scott: The one thing I do like about the golf is how if you land in the sand or in the rough and then you like Try to use the driver It actually brings down the maximum power on the meter so that you can't hit it very hard without getting the you know The slice in the hook.

609
00:43:01,355 --> 00:43:04,224
Scott: so it actually prevents people for doing silly stuff.

610
00:43:04,244 --> 00:43:09,470
Scott: that happens in a lot of other golf games Like using the driver to hit out of a sand trap all the way to the hole.

611
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:15,950
Scott: You know, it actually makes landing on the fairway in the green pretty essential to getting a good score.

612
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:19,582
Rym: It's overall a really good golf game for what it is.

613
00:43:19,602 --> 00:43:25,882
Scott: Yeah, I mean you compare it to something like Golf for the NES or golf for the Atari.

614
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:27,649
Scott: It's actually a better game than that.

615
00:43:27,809 --> 00:43:31,929
Scott: Yeah It's not as good as a game as say Microsoft Golf or something like that.

616
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:34,942
Rym: But you know, what is for a Wii sport game?

617
00:43:34,983 --> 00:43:35,766
Rym: I'd give it an 8.

618
00:43:35,766 --> 00:43:36,690
Rym: I really enjoy it a lot.

619
00:43:36,811 --> 00:43:42,929
Scott: Yeah, the golf is definitely I'd say it's equal to the boxing as the second best out of the boxes.

620
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:47,910
Rym: Yeah, so I guess we should get to your favorite game the game that you kick ass at the bowling.

621
00:43:48,451 --> 00:43:51,960
Rym: Oh the bowling even though I beat you.

622
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:52,061
Rym: Yeah.

623
00:43:53,083 --> 00:43:53,444
Scott: Yeah.

624
00:43:53,504 --> 00:43:53,925
Scott: I don't know.

625
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,650
Scott: I just suck that game real hard.

626
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:57,054
Scott: Yeah, see is the thing.

627
00:43:57,074 --> 00:44:09,174
Scott: the bowling is perhaps the greatest game in Wii Sports in that it does not dumb down the game of Bowling at all because bowling is already dumb enough that you don't need to dumb it down Even to Wii Sports.

628
00:44:09,395 --> 00:44:10,899
Rym: It's pretty much straight-up bowling.

629
00:44:10,919 --> 00:44:14,670
Scott: Yeah, you get it's scores exactly like real bowling.

630
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:16,077
Scott: It plays like real bowling.

631
00:44:16,097 --> 00:44:18,328
Scott: It's pretty much perfect in every way.

632
00:44:19,453 --> 00:44:20,357
Scott: You have a me.

633
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:21,602
Scott: your me goes up to the.

634
00:44:21,743 --> 00:44:22,426
Scott: you know the lane.

635
00:44:22,607 --> 00:44:23,229
Scott: He's got a ball.

636
00:44:24,052 --> 00:44:26,869
Scott: You move left and right you you aim where you want to throw it.

637
00:44:27,191 --> 00:44:31,009
Scott: Then you hold the Wiimote up in the air like you're holding the bowling ball up in the air.

638
00:44:31,578 --> 00:44:35,559
Scott: You push B. as soon as you push B the guy starts his bowling motion.

639
00:44:36,161 --> 00:44:44,070
Scott: you then start your bowling motion and When you want to let go of the ball you let go of B and then oh there goes the ball now.

640
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:48,470
Rym: This is the only part that at least me and a lot of other people but some people don't found a little counterintuitive.

641
00:44:49,132 --> 00:45:07,650
Scott: It seems like some people do it just right and some people it really screws them up because you try to do your natural bowling motion and If your natural bowling motion isn't is way wacky and a lot of people have wacky bowling motions as their natural way to bowl You're gonna have a problem with the Wii bowling.

642
00:45:07,911 --> 00:45:11,690
Rym: Well, the thing is also that you can't control the backswing or anything.

643
00:45:11,891 --> 00:45:22,210
Rym: Once you hit B press a press a the guy just starts going Immediately starts bringing it back and stepping forward to bowl Mm-hmm, and you can't control how fast you're slowly brings it back.

644
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:24,237
Rym: So you pretty much have to match what he's doing.

645
00:45:24,298 --> 00:45:30,144
Scott: a lot of people when you bought when they bowl will bring the ball back Hold it back and then bring it forward.

646
00:45:30,386 --> 00:45:31,150
Scott: No, I don't do that.

647
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:40,090
Scott: Well, some people do but I like or the other thing is like my dad He would push B then he would wait a second and then he would start his bowling motion.

648
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:46,330
Scott: But by the time he'd started his bowling motion they got the me on the screen had already finished the bowling motion.

649
00:45:46,852 --> 00:45:50,990
Scott: So he would end up letting go of the B way too late and the ball wouldn't go, right?

650
00:45:51,290 --> 00:46:03,032
Rym: my things is the way I bowled and I kind of picked this up the one time I took a bowling class and that was Probably the best time I ever had in terms of bowling because I actually got almost kind of okay I am.

651
00:46:03,615 --> 00:46:09,878
Rym: I got to the point where I averaged about a hundred and thirty which for me is Double what I normally do in bowling.

652
00:46:09,898 --> 00:46:12,810
Scott: that's about my real-world bowling average something like that.

653
00:46:13,078 --> 00:46:24,450
Rym: Yeah But I don't really hold the ball up Before I go when I'm in my neutral stance before I actually move forward to bowl I hold it kind of in front of me and I draw it back instead of having it up down and back.

654
00:46:24,691 --> 00:46:25,696
Scott: Oh, see I do it up down.

655
00:46:25,736 --> 00:46:31,150
Rym: So that totally fucks me up and we both yeah, it's gonna do that But other than that, it's it's actually really good.

656
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:36,050
Rym: The the amount of control you have over the spin is quite a bit more than you'd expect

657
00:46:36,553 --> 00:46:53,014
Scott: Actually feels right like, you know, if you Try to spin the ball left or right or if you you know Don't swing your arm in a perfectly straight motion Or if you let go of be too early or too late or swing harder or swing lighter, you know It all seems to.

658
00:46:53,678 --> 00:47:02,290
Scott: the ball seems to respond to all of those motions Exactly or close to the way a real bowling ball would or as close as it could possibly be for this sort of technology.

659
00:47:02,793 --> 00:47:08,839
Scott: You know, they're obviously using the full Gradient of analog inputs from the wiimote.

660
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,750
Rym: so last and probably will certainly not least is boxing.

661
00:47:13,211 --> 00:47:14,254
Scott: Yeah boxing.

662
00:47:14,274 --> 00:47:14,916
Scott: I don't know.

663
00:47:14,996 --> 00:47:16,802
Scott: It's it's it's great.

664
00:47:16,902 --> 00:47:18,306
Scott: But at the same time it's not so great.

665
00:47:18,406 --> 00:47:26,097
Rym: It's really really fun but it's not that precise or an Indicative of skill.

666
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:31,859
Scott: Yeah, it's like the controls are a little bit clumsy Like I tried to do the training and to do the training.

667
00:47:31,919 --> 00:47:38,742
Scott: It's like okay punch the guy in in these examples Exact locations and I can't aim the gloves in exact locations.

668
00:47:38,762 --> 00:47:41,170
Scott: I don't know what the hell they're thinking that's even possible.

669
00:47:41,735 --> 00:47:43,409
Rym: Actually, I can do that kind of okay.

670
00:47:44,072 --> 00:47:50,010
Rym: But the problem is when I play in the actual boxing it doesn't seem to work against a human opponent.

671
00:47:50,344 --> 00:48:04,530
Scott: Yeah my strategy in boxing is pretty much I hold my gloves one in front of my head and one in front of my body to Block pretty much anything people throw at me and then as soon as I see openings I go punch punch punch punch punch and it seems to work pretty well.

672
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:08,441
Scott: I win a lot and it's fun, but not really.

673
00:48:08,681 --> 00:48:14,790
Scott: It's it's not really at punch-out levels of bowling at bowling boxing.

674
00:48:16,672 --> 00:48:21,109
Rym: That was awesome, yeah, yeah, there's not much more we can say about boxing.

675
00:48:21,129 --> 00:48:21,310
Rym: really.

676
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:23,942
Rym: I mean you can punch to the head you can punch to the body.

677
00:48:24,284 --> 00:48:27,215
Rym: You can do a hook You can dodge.

678
00:48:27,316 --> 00:48:28,058
Scott: dodging is key.

679
00:48:28,279 --> 00:48:29,162
Scott: Yep, you can block.

680
00:48:29,764 --> 00:48:31,370
Scott: Yeah, it's fast paced.

681
00:48:31,611 --> 00:48:36,066
Scott: You know if people know what they're doing it actually gets pretty exciting because your fight will go for three rounds.

682
00:48:36,427 --> 00:48:40,469
Scott: Yeah, but It's also not really clear.

683
00:48:40,972 --> 00:48:46,534
Scott: I mean, I know for a fact that if you get knocked down and you don't do anything You don't push any buttons.

684
00:48:46,815 --> 00:48:50,630
Rym: You won't get back up, but we don't know what buttons to push to get up because it's a Wii.

685
00:48:50,871 --> 00:49:00,016
Rym: It's not like the Nintendo where you just hit A and B. So whenever you're knocked down you end up flailing both arms and hitting every button on all the Wii modes Just hoping something will happen.

686
00:49:00,579 --> 00:49:02,870
Scott: This is the kind of thing we got to look on game facts to see.

687
00:49:03,492 --> 00:49:05,019
Scott: I'm gonna look at up right now actually.

688
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:07,470
Rym: Yeah, but other than that and it's fun.

689
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:18,650
Rym: but one problem that I have is that and I was surprised at this but the Cable between the Wiimote and the nunchuck is a little too long and it keeps hitting me directly in the junk.

690
00:49:19,732 --> 00:49:22,670
Rym: When I'm standing there boxing it must be the way I hold myself.

691
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:32,630
Rym: Maybe it's from when we a bunch of us took like a kung fu class at RIT And you hold your fist kind of low so I hold my fist kind of low and that thing just keeps hitting me down there.

692
00:49:33,112 --> 00:49:47,829
Scott: Yeah, well if I play boxing while sitting down in fact if I play a lot of nunchuck games while sitting down The stupid wire like I don't know what to do with it because it's like sitting in my lap and it's kind of in the way I wish the nunchuck was wireless or something.

693
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:54,430
Scott: Also, the nunchuck doesn't seem to risk like it seems to be a lot easier to hit with the Wiimote than it is to hit.

694
00:49:54,611 --> 00:49:57,681
Rym: See actually for me it was the other way around.

695
00:49:58,042 --> 00:50:00,570
Rym: every time I've won a boxing match or any time I do.

696
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:05,368
Rym: Well, my technique is to only punch with the left hand because I'm so much more accurate with it.

697
00:50:05,589 --> 00:50:06,131
Scott: Really I'm.

698
00:50:06,171 --> 00:50:10,390
Scott: so the Wiimote seems like I have a lot more control over that glove and the nunchuck.

699
00:50:10,732 --> 00:50:13,002
Scott: I can't always get it to throw a punch like sometimes.

700
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:14,570
Scott: I'll try to punch and it won't punch.

701
00:50:14,691 --> 00:50:16,038
Scott: It'll just kind of float around there.

702
00:50:16,058 --> 00:50:18,310
Rym: See I get that with the Wiimote and the nunchucks weird.

703
00:50:18,953 --> 00:50:21,969
Rym: Uh, maybe actually remember when we were playing before and you were beating me.

704
00:50:22,311 --> 00:50:26,270
Rym: But then out of the blue I kind of knocked you down and got all your health out in one go.

705
00:50:26,933 --> 00:50:29,670
Rym: I mean you totally won the match, but I knocked you down that one time.

706
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:30,392
Scott: Yeah Well that was.

707
00:50:30,613 --> 00:50:33,103
Scott: I was slowly losing health over time as I got hit.

708
00:50:33,183 --> 00:50:43,390
Rym: what I when that happened Most of the health I took away is I was I took the left We none Chuck and I went face face face face face face face face and nothing else.

709
00:50:43,992 --> 00:50:48,507
Rym: That's my primary technique in boxing, but it only works if the other person I don't know.

710
00:50:48,547 --> 00:50:49,330
Rym: I don't know when it works.

711
00:50:49,950 --> 00:51:00,650
Scott: Think part of what it is is like with the Wiimote you kind of flick it like flick flick flick and with the nunchuck You kind of actually had to push it forward in space like a real punch true, you know.

712
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:02,209
Scott: And it's like two different motions.

713
00:51:02,652 --> 00:51:05,689
Scott: So you try to do the same motion with both devices and it doesn't work.

714
00:51:06,171 --> 00:51:17,768
Scott: You kind of have to punch the nunchuck actually physically forward like you're really punching but with the Wiimote you can just kind of flick your wrist like you're whipping or Smacking with a paddle or something like that.

715
00:51:18,493 --> 00:51:20,123
Rym: But yeah, we sports is pretty fun.

716
00:51:20,263 --> 00:51:21,330
Rym: It's definitely a tech demo.

717
00:51:21,771 --> 00:51:30,458
Scott: yeah, if you get a we and all you get is we sports you probably won't be disappointed for a few weeks and Until the real party games come out.

718
00:51:30,579 --> 00:51:33,550
Scott: This is what you've got to go on and it won't be so bad.

719
00:51:33,611 --> 00:51:34,729
Scott: You'll have a lot of fun at parties.

720
00:51:34,951 --> 00:51:46,990
Rym: Well, if you really really need a party game you can get monkey ball, which is not the best game by any stretch But it's got enough fun in it to hold you over in terms of party style game.

721
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:51,330
Scott: I've heard that Rayman has some multiplayer also, but I haven't played it and I don't plan on buying it.
