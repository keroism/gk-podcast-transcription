00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,120
Rym: It's Thursday, January 12th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,440
Rym: Tonight, we begin our ongoing in-depth series on how to attend conventions.

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,818
Scott: Let's do this!

4
00:00:20,781 --> 00:00:25,000
Scott: So, today at work, I spent about half my day working on our forums.

5
00:00:26,102 --> 00:00:30,020
Rym: Yeah, people might have noticed because there was a lot of posting going on while you were fiddling with them.

6
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,199
Scott: And if you didn't notice, that's because you're not on our forums and you should be.

7
00:00:34,661 --> 00:00:35,980
Rym: Yeah, the forums are really hopping.

8
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:38,000
Rym: I mean, we're not just saying that to try to get you to go.

9
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,379
Rym: There's actually a lot of people there posting about the show.

10
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:47,160
Scott: Yeah, and if you want to, you know, discuss the things we talk about with like-minded people, you should probably go to the forums.

11
00:00:47,661 --> 00:00:50,120
Scott: It's a lot of fun, and the more people, the merrier.

12
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,980
Rym: Plus, we added, well, Scott added, avatars.

13
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,341
Scott: Avatars.

14
00:00:54,442 --> 00:01:01,240
Scott: I think it's a lot better than the PHPBB avatars, which are like, they get really big and they stick out into the page.

15
00:01:01,481 --> 00:01:06,480
Scott: I don't know, I always think that people use way too big ones, and they're not uniform, and they're all kind of ugly.

16
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,081
Scott: The worst?

17
00:01:07,102 --> 00:01:11,300
Rym: Have you ever been on just those unmoderated forums that are out there in the cesspool of the internet?

18
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:11,972
Rym: Yup.

19
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,419
Rym: The ones that don't have restrictions on like, SIGs?

20
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,633
Rym: I've seen SIGs that were a full 640x480 like, flash animation.

21
00:01:19,841 --> 00:01:21,180
Scott: Yeah, I can't take that stuff.

22
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,374
Scott: So, our avatars just use these cute little 32x32 pixel dealies.

23
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,760
Scott: Other things I added to the forum besides avatars are a few new themes.

24
00:01:30,263 --> 00:01:33,019
Scott: There's a blue theme and a red theme that are new.

25
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,260
Rym: Yeah, we're thinking about putting the blue theme or some derivative of it on the main site.

26
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:43,560
Scott: Yeah, that way the forum will appear to be seamlessly integrated with the actual site, which could be kind of cool.

27
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,220
Scott: I made the blue theme the default because I think it looks better than the default default theme.

28
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:54,660
Scott: But if you really want the original default theme, it's still in there and you can switch it in your account settings or whatever.

29
00:01:55,141 --> 00:02:01,300
Rym: Also, due to popular demand, meaning three people complained about this, there is now a link back to the site from the forum.

30
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:17,920
Scott: Yeah, it might not be obvious, but now in the big white title that says "Front Row Crew Forums" at the top of the page, if you click on that, it'll take you back to frontrowcrew.com, which you should be going to anyway, even if you, you know, get the podcast via some RSS somewhere.

31
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:21,358
Rym: Even though not that many do, compared to the people who just download the MP3.

32
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:29,498
Scott: Yeah, but everyone visit frontrowcrew.com and there's actual, like, posts in the blog and other information for you that you should check out.

33
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:30,360
Scott: And the forum.

34
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,047
Rym: Yep, and regarding that, I just have one quick question.

35
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:37,080
Rym: Whoever's using Winamp to listen to this, like, straight off the feed, I'm curious how you're doing it.

36
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:46,940
Rym: Because I look at all my feed statistics every couple days, and of all the different readers that it says, like, contact the RSS and download the files, one of them is Winamp.

37
00:02:47,421 --> 00:02:50,000
Rym: One all alone, and it downloads every single episode.

38
00:02:51,351 --> 00:02:51,720
Scott: Hmm, I wonder.

39
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,159
Rym: Yeah, I was just curious about that.

40
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,077
Scott: Because I don't think Winamp has a podcatcher in it.

41
00:02:55,681 --> 00:02:57,159
Rym: Unless someone made a plugin that does it.

42
00:02:57,421 --> 00:02:57,720
Scott: Maybe.

43
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,920
Rym: I don't know, I haven't used Winamp since I switched to Linux.

44
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,954
Scott: I use it, but I only play MP3s in it, and that's it.

45
00:03:03,215 --> 00:03:04,100
Scott: And not often, either.

46
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,140
Rym: I mean, I used to use it for Shoutcast, and I know if you give it a URL of an MP3, it'll just play it, so.

47
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,467
Scott: Another small change I made to the forum.

48
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:16,420
Scott: You'll notice on the top left, after you sign in, there's a little pull-down menu.

49
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,889
Scott: And you can change the categories in this little menu.

50
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:27,980
Scott: And that way, if you click on the technology category, then only the technology stories will appear.

51
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,720
Scott: And it's easier than clicking on the categories tab, and then clicking on the category you want.

52
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,751
Scott: You can just use the little pull-down menu.

53
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:36,697
Scott: It makes it a little easier to use.

54
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,940
Rym: You can see now that there's a lot of discussions going on in there.

55
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:47,098
Scott: Yeah, now that there's three pages of posts, it's a lot easier to filter out the categories using this pull-down on the side than...

56
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,640
Rym: Now, along with this, we're probably going to add some more categories at some point.

57
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,920
Rym: Because I noticed there aren't that many categories that are useful yet.

58
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:56,394
Scott: Yeah, we'll add more categories.

59
00:03:56,414 --> 00:03:57,280
Scott: It shouldn't be a problem.

60
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,500
Rym: Yeah, if you have a really burning desire for us to add a specific one, let us know and we'll think about it.

61
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,380
Scott: Or maybe we'll just start a new thread, Category Request Thread.

62
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:05,896
Rym: Yep.

63
00:04:06,141 --> 00:04:08,288
Scott: The last thing I added is Private Messaging.

64
00:04:08,408 --> 00:04:12,160
Scott: But it's not private messaging like on PHPVB or whatever.

65
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:12,898
Rym: It's really cool.

66
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,343
Scott: It's much better than that.

67
00:04:14,644 --> 00:04:18,760
Scott: I thought it's called Whispering, actually, which is very appropriate to how it works.

68
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:24,260
Scott: Basically, when you start a new discussion, you can type in someone's username on the forums.

69
00:04:24,961 --> 00:04:27,480
Scott: And it'll auto-complete the usernames in case you forget them.

70
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,571
Scott: So just start typing a letter and the rest of it will appear.

71
00:04:30,972 --> 00:04:33,040
Scott: You know, like Google Suggest or whatever.

72
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:37,760
Rym: So I swear to God, if anyone takes the name "Rym" with like a "D" at the end of it, I'll kill you.

73
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,624
Scott: Yeah.

74
00:04:40,305 --> 00:04:46,080
Scott: And then, you know, set your subject and type your message and you can start your own private discussion with somebody.

75
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,160
Scott: And the only people who can see it are you and that other person.

76
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,340
Rym: Now, cooler, you can do that within another discussion.

77
00:04:52,660 --> 00:05:01,620
Scott: Right, so let's say me, Rym, Joe Blow, and Joe Schmo are having a discussion about... Anime.

78
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:02,403
Scott: Anime.

79
00:05:03,146 --> 00:05:06,600
Scott: And Joe Blow and Joe Schmo start having a fanboy rant, right?

80
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:11,140
Scott: In the middle of that discussion, I can send a whisper to Rym.

81
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,960
Scott: I type in "Rym" when I... I reply to it just like I would reply to any message.

82
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,056
Scott: But in the whisper box, I type "Rym" and I say, "Wow, these two guys are huge

83
00:05:20,096 --> 00:05:20,638
Scott: fanboys.".

84
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,319
Scott: That'll put a message in that discussion, but only me and Rym will see it.

85
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:30,780
Scott: And those Joe Blow and Joe Schmo won't see it when they go and look at that discussion.

86
00:05:31,162 --> 00:05:34,040
Rym: I guess the technical turn is side-channel communication.

87
00:05:34,681 --> 00:05:40,958
Scott: Yeah, you're literally whispering to one other person in the discussion without anyone else seeing it.

88
00:05:41,018 --> 00:05:41,600
Scott: It's way cool.

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,105
Rym: Yeah, play around with the forum.

90
00:05:43,627 --> 00:05:45,976
Rym: And obviously, let us know if you find anything broken.

91
00:05:45,996 --> 00:05:46,840
Rym: We'll fix it right away.

92
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,030
Scott: Yeah, I don't think anything's broken now.

93
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,500
Scott: I've pretty much fixed it all.

94
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,800
Scott: Alright, and since we pushed the forum a little bit too much, let me push the rest of our stuff.

95
00:05:56,402 --> 00:05:57,906
Scott: You can email us feedback.

96
00:05:58,388 --> 00:06:02,360
Scott: Email still works, and, you know, especially if you're not a forum-type person.

97
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,819
Scott: You just want to talk to us or something like that.

98
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,840
Rym: Yeah, because we used to get, you know, not really negative feedback, but constructive criticism.

99
00:06:09,142 --> 00:06:12,019
Rym: And we seem to have addressed all the complaints because they stopped coming in.

100
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:12,580
Rym: Yep.

101
00:06:13,182 --> 00:06:20,200
Scott: Anyway, so send emails of any sort, audio feedbacks, you know, or anything like that to geekknights@gmail.com.

102
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,423
Rym: Call our phone number.

103
00:06:21,744 --> 00:06:28,300
Rym: I mean, if you call it and you leave us a message that's even halfway crap, we'll probably play it and then respond to it in some way.

104
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:34,040
Scott: Yeah, the phone number is, I'm going to put it on the website eventually when I redo the blog part.

105
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:35,440
Rym: 508-677-0300.

106
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,240
Scott: 508-677-0300.

107
00:06:45,782 --> 00:06:46,965
Rym: So, moving on with the news.

108
00:06:47,848 --> 00:06:52,040
Rym: We talked a lot about the new Mac Intel PCs coming out.

109
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,880
Rym: And now there's a lot of questions as to whether or not they're actually going to be able to run Windows.

110
00:06:57,641 --> 00:06:59,639
Rym: And the short answer is, no one knows.

111
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:09,540
Scott: The story is, is that right now, PCs with, you know, normal Intel AMD processors, whatever, have a BIOS in them.

112
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,279
Rym: Basic input/output system.

113
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:11,820
Rym: Right.

114
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:12,584
Rym: That's all that stuff.

115
00:07:12,604 --> 00:07:15,420
Rym: you see when the computer boots before Windows or Linux starts.

116
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,735
Rym: You know, hit F1 and then there's all these options.

117
00:07:17,755 --> 00:07:18,400
Rym: you don't understand.

118
00:07:19,285 --> 00:07:20,058
Scott: That's all that stuff.

119
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,608
Scott: Basically, Apple doesn't use BIOS.

120
00:07:24,728 --> 00:07:28,560
Scott: Apple uses Open Firmware, which is more advanced by far.

121
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,725
Scott: BIOS is really, really old and crappy.

122
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:35,740
Scott: It's just so standard and old that we keep using it instead of switching to something new.

123
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,220
Scott: There's something even newer called EFI, which is something Intel invented.

124
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:43,240
Rym: Extensible Firmware Interface.

125
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,283
Scott: Yeah.

126
00:07:44,303 --> 00:07:46,960
Scott: They invented that for those Itanium chips, actually.

127
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,740
Rym: Which is, isn't that what's in the MacTiles?

128
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,688
Scott: That is what is in the MacBooks.

129
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:56,600
Scott: That, with the Intel Duo whatever chips.

130
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:02,540
Rym: Now this raises a big question because Windows Vista supposedly is going to support this just fine.

131
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,729
Rym: But Windows XP 2000, 98, 311, not a chance.

132
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,325
Scott: Nope, those do not support it.

133
00:08:10,405 --> 00:08:16,600
Scott: However, Windows XP 64-bit edition supposedly does support EFI.

134
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,600
Rym: Of course, that ray of hope is shattered immediately by the fact that these aren't 64-bit processors.

135
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,519
Scott: Yeah, the Intel Core Duo is not a 64-bit processor.

136
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:32,778
Scott: So, the question is, will somebody, will, you know, Windows 2000 XP might just work.

137
00:08:32,798 --> 00:08:33,400
Scott: We don't even know.

138
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:39,900
Scott: If they don't work, will somebody create some sort of patch or mod to make them work?

139
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:42,128
Scott: I say probably yes, definitely.

140
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:44,217
Scott: Will Linux work?

141
00:08:44,317 --> 00:08:45,040
Scott: Almost certainly.

142
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:55,720
Scott: But it could be that you just can't run Windows 2000 XP and that you will need to have Windows Vista to run on these Apple Books.

143
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,599
Rym: And keep in mind that it's not 100% that Windows Vista will work.

144
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:10,680
Rym: Because Phil Schiller, the Apple guy who, the only one who responded to this so far, said that they don't sell or support Windows itself, but at the same time they're not preventing anyone specifically from using Windows.

145
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,815
Rym: So they're not trying to keep Windows off, but they're not trying to make Windows work.

146
00:09:14,895 --> 00:09:15,819
Rym: They're just kind of ignoring it.

147
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:25,800
Scott: Yeah, so basically it might work, and it's a pretty good bet that it will, but I wouldn't actually put any money down.

148
00:09:26,323 --> 00:09:29,140
Rym: See, I would kind of put money down because I point out two things.

149
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:37,460
Rym: One, EFI, at least in its raw form, but no one knows if they're going to implement this on these specific boxes, can fully emulate BIOS.

150
00:09:38,522 --> 00:09:41,033
Scott: Oh, see I read something like that somewhere and I was a little confused.

151
00:09:41,234 --> 00:09:42,600
Scott: So it can emulate BIOS.

152
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,061
Rym: Yes.

153
00:09:43,322 --> 00:09:48,381
Rym: However, we don't know if these will do it or if that emulated BIOS will work 100%.

154
00:09:48,381 --> 00:09:50,659
Rym: Because Windows relies on the BIOS more than you'd think.

155
00:09:52,241 --> 00:09:58,319
Rym: Two, the reason I'll bet that any Windows is going to work is that one, Grub works just fine with EFI.

156
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,526
Rym: Two, Grub can boot Windows just fine.

157
00:10:03,948 --> 00:10:04,730
Rym: Case closed.

158
00:10:05,391 --> 00:10:08,177
Rym: Because once Windows boots, it's fine.

159
00:10:08,618 --> 00:10:09,560
Rym: It just has to boot.

160
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,502
Scott: Really?

161
00:10:10,523 --> 00:10:12,420
Scott: It doesn't use the BIOS after it boots?

162
00:10:13,181 --> 00:10:18,580
Rym: Not to the point, basically once you get it booted, as long as the hardware abstraction layer is okay, it's going to work.

163
00:10:19,742 --> 00:10:28,680
Rym: Now the question will be if the old versions of Windows include a hardware abstraction layer that can handle whatever proprietary bits might be in these MacTel boxes.

164
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,029
Scott: Yeah, see that's my question.

165
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:32,580
Scott: It's something no one seems to be addressing.

166
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,409
Scott: These Macbooks have things like the Express slot.

167
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:42,040
Scott: They have things like the built-in on-motherboard Wi-Fi and USB.

168
00:10:43,181 --> 00:10:44,345
Scott: No, not USB, Bluetooth.

169
00:10:44,766 --> 00:10:45,991
Scott: That's part of the MacBook.

170
00:10:46,653 --> 00:10:48,679
Scott: They have all kinds of Mac stuff in them.

171
00:10:49,761 --> 00:10:53,057
Scott: Windows has a lot of drivers, but does it have drivers for that stuff?

172
00:10:53,077 --> 00:10:53,620
Scott: Will it work?

173
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,160
Rym: Now I could see Microsoft specifically going out of their way to add all that to Windows Vista.

174
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,316
Rym: Because, hey, they'll make money selling Windows to people who own Mac hardware.

175
00:11:01,336 --> 00:11:01,940
Rym: It's a win for them.

176
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:08,760
Scott: No, because anyone who's using Windows on Mac hardware totally is not paying for a new copy of Windows.

177
00:11:08,841 --> 00:11:11,640
Rym: I don't know, those people already dropped a couple Gs on a laptop.

178
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,973
Scott: Yeah, but you usually have to shell out $250 for Windows.

179
00:11:17,682 --> 00:11:19,035
Rym: Maybe we'll see discounts or something.

180
00:11:19,055 --> 00:11:19,539
Rym: You never know.

181
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:20,561
Scott: Maybe.

182
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:24,393
Scott: I just really don't think Microsoft wants to sell Apple hardware.

183
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,640
Scott: They want to sell hardware that has Windows on it already.

184
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,300
Rym: Yeah, but consider the markup they make when they actually sell Windows in a box.

185
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,900
Rym: I mean, Dell pays, I think, $30 or $40 for Windows, but it's $300 if you go to the store and buy it in a box.

186
00:11:38,502 --> 00:11:40,049
Scott: I think the store makes most of that money.

187
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:42,380
Scott: I don't really think Microsoft is raking it in there.

188
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,081
Rym: I don't know.

189
00:11:43,121 --> 00:11:43,925
Rym: I don't know who buys those.

190
00:11:44,085 --> 00:11:48,140
Rym: I mean, I bought a Windows 2000 box in the year 2000.

191
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:52,740
Scott: I can only see buying one of those in an absolute drop-dead emergency.

192
00:11:54,001 --> 00:11:57,511
Scott: You absolutely need a valid Windows CD and CD key.

193
00:11:58,132 --> 00:12:00,740
Scott: You can't get one any faster than going to Staples.

194
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,187
Scott: You don't know anyone who's got one.

195
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,074
Scott: You can't pirate one.

196
00:12:05,095 --> 00:12:06,440
Scott: All the internets are real slow.

197
00:12:06,901 --> 00:12:16,199
Rym: I mean, back in the day, when Windows 2000 came out, I built my computer like the week before that, and then I bought Windows 2000 at the store like the next day.

198
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,377
Scott: Oh, alright, yeah.

199
00:12:18,181 --> 00:12:19,472
Rym: And back then, you couldn't pirate it.

200
00:12:19,513 --> 00:12:20,320
Rym: Now you can pirate it.

201
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,063
Scott: I bought Windows 98 SE.

202
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:30,540
Scott: I had 95B from already, but I got a 98 SE CD just because 95 couldn't play some of the games I was buying.

203
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,830
Rym: You know, I never had any 95 after A.

204
00:12:33,584 --> 00:12:33,649
Scott: Wow.

205
00:12:33,981 --> 00:12:37,180
Rym: I used Windows 95 A, and then I had Windows 2000.

206
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:37,361
Scott: Hmm.

207
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,368
Scott: I had 95B, then I had 98 SE, and then I got 2000 way later.

208
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,240
Scott: And then I got XP for free from school, legally.

209
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:56,660
Rym: In fact, I remember when you got Windows 2000, or when you first really used Windows 2000, and you, the staunch Microsoft hater, admitted that it was in fact a fairly decent product.

210
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,136
Scott: It was better than Windows 98, is what I said.

211
00:12:59,337 --> 00:12:59,760
Scott: And it is.

212
00:13:00,861 --> 00:13:01,724
Scott: That's about all I said.

213
00:13:01,744 --> 00:13:08,659
Scott: Because Linux still just, I was using Linux, I've been using Linux for like seven years, or even more, I don't know, since high school.

214
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,440
Scott: But it was never good enough to be my 100% of the time operating system until like two or three years ago.

215
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:23,520
Rym: Yup, because I remember I tried, you gave me a copy of Mandrake, and I tried to install it on this extra computer I had, and it installed, and it was just kind of terrible.

216
00:13:24,781 --> 00:13:30,880
Scott: You know, the thing was, is that like at the time, Mandrake didn't seem terrible because I had been using Red Hat.

217
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,225
Scott: And relative to Red Hat, it was great.

218
00:13:33,826 --> 00:13:45,020
Scott: You know, and it's basically, it wasn't great enough for me to use it all the time, but I also got to think that in college I was playing a lot of PC games, a lot of Steam, a lot of Counter-Strike.

219
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:45,407
Scott: True.

220
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,779
Scott: So that had a strong effect on it.

221
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:53,960
Rym: I mean, we would literally come home from class like every day, and then just start playing Counter-Strike for like four hours.

222
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,462
Scott: Yeah.

223
00:13:55,522 --> 00:14:02,140
Scott: But I did use Linux in college for all of my work, and then my last two years I was pretty much using Gentoo only.

224
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:08,300
Rym: Yeah, I actually, it was weird, but despite the fact that I was in IT, we used Windows a lot more than we used Linux.

225
00:14:08,961 --> 00:14:16,760
Rym: Because most of our labs were Windows like Active Directory, Windows Domain, crap, because all the Linux stuff was kind of easy, and they didn't spend much time on it.

226
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,120
Scott: I had a lab partner do all that, and I did all the Linux stuff.

227
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,819
Rym: See, I was the lab partner who did all the Windows stuff, and then the other guy did all the Linux stuff.

228
00:14:24,404 --> 00:14:25,980
Rym: Of course, now I use Linux exclusively.

229
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:38,220
Scott: So for my Think of the Day, I got the video that disappeared from Google Video yesterday is back.

230
00:14:39,061 --> 00:14:43,720
Scott: It's basically a video of three guys at a comedy festival singing a song that's kind of funny.

231
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:50,080
Rym: Yeah, it wasn't as funny as I expected anything like that to be, but at least the topic hit close to home.

232
00:14:50,843 --> 00:14:51,360
Scott: Very close.

233
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:51,729
Scott: Yeah.

234
00:14:52,806 --> 00:14:53,072
Scott: Watch it.

235
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:01,419
Rym: So my thing, you know how whenever they bring games over from Japan to America, they always Romanize them or localize them?

236
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:09,719
Rym: Like, they'll change the cover, they'll change translation things, they'll take out the cultural jokes that Americans wouldn't get, they'll make the game easier, you know, that sort of thing.

237
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:16,980
Rym: Well, here's a site that shows the opposite, what they do to games that come from America to Japan.

238
00:15:17,643 --> 00:15:18,879
Rym: And they do a lot of the same things.

239
00:15:19,201 --> 00:15:24,580
Scott: Well, the biggest thing it shows is the changing of the cover art of the packaging.

240
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,079
Rym: Which was a lot more than you'd expect for some games.

241
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:35,119
Scott: The biggest one, I think, was this, uh, what was the name of the game, like, Seduki or something like that?

242
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:35,380
Scott: I don't know.

243
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,038
Rym: Yo, some RPG.

244
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:36,812
Scott: Some RPG.

245
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:42,779
Scott: But the American cover had, like, this hot CG, obviously CG babe on it.

246
00:15:43,681 --> 00:15:53,240
Scott: And the Japanese cover had this hand- well, looked like hand-drawn, anime-style RPG-looking character of the same babe.

247
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,759
Rym: Who I thought was a lot more attractive.

248
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,160
Scott: I thought it was very much a better looking cover.

249
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:08,100
Scott: Most of the Japanese covers, I think, were either equal but different to the American covers, or just better looking with brighter colors and they were happier.

250
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,619
Scott: I think the biggest example was the Ratchet and Clank ones.

251
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:18,620
Rym: Oh, yeah, because the American ones were these crappy CG, like you see on the front of every stupid third-party game for every system ever.

252
00:16:19,742 --> 00:16:22,700
Rym: And in Japan, there were these funny, anime-type drawings.

253
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,509
Scott: Yeah, and in the American covers, there were, like, these angry guys.

254
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:28,114
Scott: It was an angry cat guy.

255
00:16:28,134 --> 00:16:30,039
Scott: I don't know what he is, but he's an angry guy.

256
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:30,500
Scott: He's angry.

257
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,539
Rym: He's angry with a gun.

258
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,526
Scott: But on the Japanese cover, he's, like, smiling and he's like,

259
00:16:34,566 --> 00:16:34,766
Scott: "Weeeee!".

260
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,579
Rym: Same game in Japan, happy soldiers chilling on a beach.

261
00:16:46,323 --> 00:16:46,383
Scott: Yep.

262
00:16:46,403 --> 00:16:52,077
Scott: And even though it's the same exact game when you actually play it, except, of course, for the translation, you know, it's 99% the same game.

263
00:16:54,340 --> 00:17:00,600
Scott: But they changed the cover so much because, you know, I guess what appeals to the different cultures and different sides of the ocean.

264
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:05,138
Scott: But the Japanese covers actually appeal more to me than the American ones do.

265
00:17:05,501 --> 00:17:13,599
Rym: I find that interesting, but I note that our taste in games seems to vary greatly from that of most mainstream gamers in America.

266
00:17:14,361 --> 00:17:17,180
Rym: We're like the old-school Nintendo-Japan types.

267
00:17:18,181 --> 00:17:18,281
Scott: Yeah.

268
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:25,920
Scott: I do think, though, that they greatly underestimate how big those types of Japanese games would sell here, and they should really bring more of them over.

269
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:40,320
Rym: Yeah, I don't think they'd appeal to a wide audience, but I think the audience they do appeal to, namely people like us or people who listen to the show or people who go to, like, anime cons, you know, us types, I think we would more than make up for that.

270
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,925
Scott: We would definitely make up for it.

271
00:17:42,025 --> 00:17:44,396
Scott: And, you know, you just don't have to print so many of them.

272
00:17:44,516 --> 00:17:45,179
Scott: I keep saying this.

273
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,985
Scott: Katamari came over.

274
00:17:47,428 --> 00:17:49,820
Scott: They only printed, like, a few copies per store.

275
00:17:50,121 --> 00:17:59,440
Rym: And yet, I mean, you all know I've talked about my coworkers in my office periodically, and to say that they're fuddy-duddies, and I hate using that word, it's kind of an understatement.

276
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,219
Rym: They all know what Katamari is and love it.

277
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:02,940
Scott: Yeah.

278
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:09,160
Scott: So, all those other things that are like Katamari that you're keeping from us, Japan, send them on over ASAP.

279
00:18:10,621 --> 00:18:11,520
Scott: Alright, so, yeah.

280
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,680
Rym: So, we decided to start another ongoing series.

281
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,540
Scott: Well, it might just be a two-parter, I'm betting.

282
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,478
Rym: At least a two-parter.

283
00:18:17,861 --> 00:18:22,820
Rym: We could possibly stretch into three, because this is a subject we could rant on a lot for a number of reasons.

284
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,565
Rym: But basically, conventions.

285
00:18:25,986 --> 00:18:31,600
Rym: Anime cons, gaming cons, trade conventions, Linux conventions, all sorts of conventions.

286
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,932
Scott: It's convention season starting about now, I think.

287
00:18:35,053 --> 00:18:36,620
Scott: OhioCon just happened, right?

288
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:37,142
Rym: Yep.

289
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:38,879
Rym: And it's not too long until KatsuCon.

290
00:18:39,181 --> 00:18:39,361
Rym: Yep.

291
00:18:40,023 --> 00:18:46,140
Scott: So, we're gonna prep you all, especially those people who, if you haven't been to a convention, you're thinking about going.

292
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,900
Scott: If you haven't been to a convention not thinking about going, maybe you'll think about going, because you should.

293
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,800
Scott: Maybe you're a convention veteran, and, you know, it doesn't matter.

294
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:06,140
Rym: Now, I hope we don't sound like condescending, or like we're explaining this stupidly, but I guess, to put it lightly, we've been to a lot of conventions.

295
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,080
Scott: We're, what you could say, grandmasters of convention skills.

296
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,320
Rym: I mean, we're not the old man who has 40 Otakon badges.

297
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,639
Scott: That guy's scary, oh my god.

298
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,020
Rym: Yeah, that guy has like, he wears this armor of badges from all the cons.

299
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:21,100
Scott: I don't think he wears it anymore, but I recognize the guy, and I still see him there.

300
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:21,701
Rym: Yep.

301
00:19:22,303 --> 00:19:27,660
Rym: But, the main reason that we want to do this is that we have a lot of friends, and like all of us go to conventions.

302
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:32,000
Rym: Like, we go to Otakon, you know, 22,000 geeks, and we run into a lot of people we know.

303
00:19:32,701 --> 00:19:43,300
Rym: And it seems like almost every other group of people we run into has some sort of drama, or problems, or they had issues with the convention, and it made it a less fun experience overall for them.

304
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:57,080
Scott: Yeah, pretty much anyone I meet, even like just hearing complete strangers talk to each other, I just hear a lot of people with some sort of problem, or someone will complain about a convention sucking, and they might even recognize that it was their fault.

305
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:05,940
Scott: But it was still, they could have had a better time, but they didn't, because they didn't do something, or they didn't know something that I knew, and could do, and could have told them to do.

306
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:18,580
Rym: And, I mean, the main thing is, it started out, we start, we're like, we go to a convention, just a few of us in a room, and every year, some of the people who had drama would decide, hey, we want to stay with Rym and Scott, because their room is awesome, and they don't have trouble.

307
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:28,260
Rym: So, every year we've had more and more people stay with us, and for like this coming Otakon, I've already got three whole rooms booked in the Renaissance just for us.

308
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:37,180
Rym: And we've had people, like we had a group of people ask us after the last Otakon, hey, can we stay with you guys, because it sucked last year staying with these other people.

309
00:20:37,802 --> 00:20:38,056
Scott: Wow.

310
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:38,717
Scott: Yeah.

311
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:43,219
Rym: So, I guess all I'm trying to say is we know what we're talking about when it comes to this.

312
00:20:44,141 --> 00:20:48,020
Rym: We may not know about viruses, Pete and Lisa and all you people in the forums.

313
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,566
Scott: Yeah, we know about conventions.

314
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,380
Scott: We are convention experts.

315
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:58,420
Scott: So, the first thing you have to know about a convention is, should you go to it or not?

316
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:05,300
Rym: And, a lot of people really don't, like they say, oh, I want to go to a convention, but they don't really think about what they would actually do at it.

317
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:12,300
Scott: Yeah, the first thing I look at when I'm looking at a convention is location and guests.

318
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:20,860
Rym: Mostly location, because the number of hours it takes you to get to a con is really going to affect whether or not it's worth it to go.

319
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,680
Rym: I mean, driving an hour to a crappy con is not as bad as driving nine hours to a crappy con.

320
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:36,340
Scott: If this is a convention less than an hour away, it really doesn't matter how crappy it is, even if it's as bad as it could possibly be, it's probably worth going.

321
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,299
Scott: Just because, you know, you'll get something out of it.

322
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:46,840
Rym: Because when we lived in Rochester, I used to do a lot of work with the anime club where we'd go and like show anime at other cons in the area.

323
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:53,700
Rym: So, we'd go to these little gaming cons and sci-fi cons like Astronomicon and Unicon, and they weren't the greatest cons.

324
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,780
Rym: They were kind of small, but they were like 40 minutes away and it was a lot of fun.

325
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,680
Scott: But if those were like two hours away, not a chance.

326
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:08,300
Scott: But meanwhile, something like PAX almost has enough draw to get me to cross the entire country to go to it.

327
00:22:08,582 --> 00:22:11,199
Rym: Yeah, if we had had money, we probably would have gone this year.

328
00:22:11,881 --> 00:22:15,700
Scott: Yeah, we seriously considered going all the way to Seattle from New York.

329
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:18,620
Rym: Just to hang out with a bunch of nerds and geeks for a weekend.

330
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,080
Scott: Yeah, because their convention was going to be so amazing.

331
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,190
Scott: I mean, look at the concert they had lined up.

332
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,920
Scott: Damn, mini bosses, MC Frontline, holy crap.

333
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,160
Rym: Now, if you've never been to a con before, you really want to pay attention to what's going on at the con.

334
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,500
Rym: Because for someone who's never been to one before, you want to do all the stuff.

335
00:22:36,962 --> 00:22:39,778
Rym: So what matters the most usually is what stuff there is to do.

336
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:47,760
Rym: But if you start going to them a lot, to the point that you've done all the stuff there is, you really don't care what the convention's doing.

337
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,540
Rym: You just go because it's an excuse to hang out with your friends in this unique setting and meet new people.

338
00:22:52,601 --> 00:22:53,799
Scott: That's pretty much how it is.

339
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,960
Scott: I mean, once you've seen one cosplay, you've seen them all.

340
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,960
Scott: And once you've seen one music video contest, you've seen them all.

341
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,020
Scott: And once you, you know, had one Giant Land party, you played them all.

342
00:23:04,781 --> 00:23:13,280
Scott: And sure, it might still be fun to do it again, but it's not, it's like once you, when you go to your first convention, all you want to do is do all these things you've never done before.

343
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,598
Scott: And then after a few cons, you're like, "I done all that," and you're looking for something new, but there won't be anything new.

344
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,239
Scott: The only way to get something new is to go to a different type of convention, but eventually you run out of those too.

345
00:23:25,021 --> 00:23:31,060
Rym: So don't be the person who goes to, like, their ninth Otakon and sits in the room all alone complaining that there's nothing cool to do.

346
00:23:31,341 --> 00:23:35,980
Scott: Yeah, you gotta, you know, you start out doing all the cool things, but then it's still cool.

347
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,760
Scott: Some people, a lot of people just stop going to them, they've noticed.

348
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,620
Scott: But we keep going because, you know, we make our own fun, you know?

349
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,640
Scott: I mean, Nintendo DS helped a little bit.

350
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,440
Rym: Yeah, but I mean, quite literally, we go to Otakon every year, and we do almost nothing at the con.

351
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,720
Rym: We barely, I mean, we don't go in any panels.

352
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,019
Scott: I think we went to one panel.

353
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,540
Rym: Yeah, and then I ran that one panel.

354
00:23:55,908 --> 00:23:56,099
Scott: Yeah.

355
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:00,340
Rym: And we watch, like, we watch one closing ceremonies type thing.

356
00:24:00,721 --> 00:24:05,440
Scott: I spent more time in the live-action Asian cinema room than any other single room.

357
00:24:06,702 --> 00:24:09,160
Scott: Like, I might have spent equal time there and the dealer's room.

358
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:10,959
Rym: I spent most of my time just hanging out.

359
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,720
Scott: Oh yeah, I was hanging out, oh, most of the time total for the whole weekend, hanging out.

360
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:20,800
Scott: But most of the time at con events was, you know, dealer's room and that room.

361
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:30,180
Scott: You know, it's, and, but newbies, they go to every single freaky panel, and they go to every single, you know, all this, you know, wacky stuff.

362
00:24:30,521 --> 00:24:32,180
Scott: That, I guess, gets old pretty quick.

363
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,800
Rym: So I guess just think about what you want out of the con, and then see if the con will provide it.

364
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:41,480
Rym: I mean, if you want to see the biggest gathering of geeks in all the world, go to Otakon.

365
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:47,020
Rym: Because Otakon, while it's an anime convention, is the closest thing to a pan-geek convention you'll ever find.

366
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,039
Scott: That's for sure.

367
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:53,960
Rym: If you want gaming, find a gaming convention, because it'll be nothing but playing games with cool people all night long.

368
00:24:54,761 --> 00:24:56,335
Rym: I'm a big fan of UberCon.

369
00:24:56,355 --> 00:24:56,779
Rym: I go to.

370
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,600
Rym: I used to go to Michicon, but I don't live in Michigan anymore.

371
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:05,538
Rym: I went to GenCon once, and if you can ever get to GenCon and you're a gamer, try it.

372
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,960
Rym: But if you're not really into games, GenCon's not worth it.

373
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,840
Scott: There's also a con I just discovered recently called Essen in Essen, Germany.

374
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,829
Scott: And that's the pinnacle of German board game.

375
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:19,140
Scott: amazingness that I will go to probably once in my life just to go.

376
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,579
Rym: Yeah, I'd love to hit that.

377
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:25,379
Scott: I think I'll just have a trip to, you know, Europe and just happen to have it while Essen is going on.

378
00:25:26,242 --> 00:25:34,740
Scott: You know, it's not really worth it to go to Essen, from all this way across the world, but it is worth, you know, if you're on a trip from Europe, you know, why not?

379
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:44,180
Rym: Now, what we're talking about really applies to all cons, but almost all of our examples are going to come from anime conventions, just because those are what we go to the most.

380
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:44,753
Scott: Yeah.

381
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:49,180
Rym: I mean, I go to gaming conventions, Scott doesn't so much, but they're almost the same.

382
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,560
Rym: Trade conventions are a little different, but don't worry about that.

383
00:25:52,580 --> 00:26:00,800
Scott: I've been to a lot of trade conventions, actually, in the food and technology related areas, and job related areas, so I can talk about those a little bit.

384
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:06,380
Scott: But they're sort of a different beast, because they're not about entertainment, they're about someone trying to sell you something.

385
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,740
Scott: So you're basically just walking around to booths looking at products and services and people advertising to you.

386
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:18,760
Rym: Yeah, you're not going to run into, like, a gaggle of cosplayers with DSs, like, running to a DDR tournament at a thing like that.

387
00:26:19,064 --> 00:26:19,479
Scott: No, you're not.

388
00:26:20,481 --> 00:26:27,900
Rym: And, actually, we went to one Linux convention, called Pinguacon, in Novi, Michigan, and I gotta say, that was fairly badass.

389
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:41,240
Scott: Yeah, I don't think any other--from what I can tell based on the website and who's been to these things and the kind of events they've had, I don't think that any other instance of Pinguacon has lived up to the one we went to, so I'm really glad we went when we did.

390
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,680
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I don't know what it was with that one Pinguacon, but we hit solid gold.

391
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,099
Rym: Neil Gaiman was there and told us a story.

392
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,479
Rym: That I slept through.

393
00:26:48,762 --> 00:26:50,499
Rym: Scott fell asleep while he was telling it.

394
00:26:50,884 --> 00:26:51,071
Rym: Oh god.

395
00:26:51,841 --> 00:26:52,960
Scott: It was a cool-- It was so sad.

396
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,998
Rym: It was a cool Detective Cthulhu story, too.

397
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:59,336
Scott: Yeah, it's like, he said, "Alright, I'm going to tell you a cool Detective Cthulhu story,".

398
00:26:59,376 --> 00:26:59,717
Scott: and I'm like,

399
00:26:59,838 --> 00:27:00,320
Scott: "Alright!".

400
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:04,450
Scott: And then he's like, "I tried to tell this story at another con, and I didn't finish.

401
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:07,457
Scott: We're going to see how many minutes it takes to tell this story.

402
00:27:07,497 --> 00:27:08,439
Scott: I'm going to finish it no matter

403
00:27:08,459 --> 00:27:08,600
Scott: what.".

404
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,004
Scott: So I'm like,

405
00:27:09,408 --> 00:27:09,914
Scott: "Alright!".

406
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:12,576
Scott: Then I start hearing the beginning of the story, and I'm like,

407
00:27:12,677 --> 00:27:13,120
Scott: "Alright!".

408
00:27:13,181 --> 00:27:13,960
Scott: And then I fell asleep.

409
00:27:14,941 --> 00:27:19,217
Scott: And then when I woke up, and he's like, "Well, it takes exactly 40-something minutes to read that story," and I said,

410
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:19,619
Scott: "Fuck!".

411
00:27:20,762 --> 00:27:21,388
Rym: "Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,

412
00:27:21,449 --> 00:27:21,651
Rym: fuck!".

413
00:27:22,721 --> 00:27:27,220
Rym: Plus, it was just, it was weird, because also, Steve Jackson was there, and he wanted to play a board game with us.

414
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,023
Scott: Yeah, and I didn't even realize it was him.

415
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:34,955
Scott: Like, we were just playing Puerto Rico in the lobby, and this kind of scruffy guy walks up, and he's like, "Hey, I kind of want to play that,".

416
00:27:34,975 --> 00:27:36,679
Scott: and I'm like, "Alright, maybe we'll hook up later,".

417
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:37,220
Scott: you know, whatever.

418
00:27:37,501 --> 00:27:40,869
Scott: And then our friend-- Someone comes over like a minute later, they were like, "Dude, that was Steve Jackson,".

419
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:41,853
Scott: and I'm like, "No way.

420
00:27:41,873 --> 00:27:43,198
Scott: What are you talking

421
00:27:43,258 --> 00:27:43,620
Scott: about?".

422
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,960
Rym: And then we go to a panel, and there's Steve Jackson talking about Steve Jackson games.

423
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:47,525
Scott: I'm like, "Oh,

424
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:47,891
Scott: shite!".

425
00:27:49,521 --> 00:27:54,360
Scott: But then for a geek fable, we'll tell later, because of that fable, we didn't actually play with him.

426
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,304
Rym: Yeah, we could've.

427
00:27:55,646 --> 00:27:58,280
Rym: We were all set to do it, but something happened.

428
00:27:58,621 --> 00:28:00,100
Scott: Well, that's a geek fable for another time.

429
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:00,695
Rym: Yes, it is.

430
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:09,180
Scott: So, once you decide if you're going to go to any particular convention, you have to decide who you're going to take with you.

431
00:28:09,462 --> 00:28:12,259
Rym: This is probably the single most important decision you can make.

432
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,339
Rym: One bad person in your group of people going to a con can ruin it.

433
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,667
Scott: And, you know, there are things you can do.

434
00:28:20,827 --> 00:28:25,300
Scott: if you happen to take a bad person, or, you know, someone might turn bad.

435
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,239
Scott: Like, someone who might be a good person, like, might get sick or something.

436
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,240
Scott: No matter how bad it makes you feel, you have to drop that person like a rock.

437
00:28:33,601 --> 00:28:38,140
Rym: Yeah, not to sound cold-hearted, but if someone's dragging you down, cast them away.

438
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,619
Rym: Because there are some people who go to a convention and, for whatever reason, just can't handle it.

439
00:28:45,422 --> 00:28:50,240
Rym: And they're probably not trying to make you have a bad time, but they're going to make you have a bad time.

440
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,540
Rym: There's nothing you can do about it except to leave them alone in the room.

441
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:57,640
Scott: Yeah, you're spending a lot of time and a lot of money to go to a convention, you know, no matter which one it is.

442
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:09,280
Scott: Even if it's, like, ten minutes away from your house and it costs five bucks to get in, if you're spending more than, like, a day there, you know, or even if you're only spending a day, you don't want that one day ruined, you know?

443
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:17,020
Rym: I mean, I went to--Scott missed this one, but I went to Anime Central with a bunch of my friends, and we always threw crazy parties there, because we had another friend who got the Presidential Suite.

444
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,620
Rym: And we had, like, it was expected that we had a crazy party.

445
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:25,780
Rym: And me and my friend Luke, we would, like, tend this non-alcoholic anime-themed bar, because the room had a frickin' bar in it.

446
00:29:26,081 --> 00:29:28,940
Rym: So we made funny drinks like the Southern Belle Dandy, you know, stuff like that.

447
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:29,396
Rym: It was cool.

448
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,640
Rym: But we're getting ready to set up for the party, and there's a guy asleep in the little bar area.

449
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:42,180
Rym: And we try to move him, and he got all mad, and he was trying to explain that he needed sleep and he was tired and he was sick, and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

450
00:29:42,441 --> 00:29:44,260
Rym: So you guys can't have a party, 'cause I need to sleep.

451
00:29:45,101 --> 00:29:47,360
Rym: Well, guess who slept in the hallway while the rest of us had a party?

452
00:29:47,781 --> 00:29:57,960
Scott: Yeah, you know, not that, you know, I can't, I can understand where the guy's coming from, because if I was sleepy and sick, I would feel the same way and probably make the same blah blah blah blah blah.

453
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:07,900
Scott: But at the same time, you know, Akan is the time of ultimate fun, and no one should have to suffer except for the person who is, you know, doing badly.

454
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:18,680
Rym: I mean, in terms of ultimate fun, basically the way we schedule Otakan, which is like the pinnacle of our year when it comes to the convention season, it's like there's all these little cons that lead up to Otakan.

455
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:26,220
Rym: Then we usually spend the entire week after it at one of our good friend's beach houses recovering from the freaking convention.

456
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:30,019
Rym: Like the day after the con, we pretty much just pass out for the whole day.

457
00:30:31,741 --> 00:30:46,420
Scott: So, when deciding who to take with you to a convention, you wanna bring with you people who are reliable, they're going to pay, whatever, you know, the cost is, and they're not going to be an anchor that drags you down and makes things unfun for others.

458
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:51,860
Rym: Be especially wary of couples that are going through the throes of breakup.

459
00:30:52,481 --> 00:30:53,380
Scott: Mmm, very dangerous.

460
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:58,740
Rym: Yes, generally unstable people, you know, people who just, like Scott said, unreliable people.

461
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,760
Scott: But, at the same time, bring as many people as possible.

462
00:31:03,221 --> 00:31:13,240
Scott: The more you bring, the cheaper it will be, and at the same time, if you have a ton of quality people, that's how you get awesome, awesome parties and awesome craziness going on.

463
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,693
Rym: I mean, this year we brought, what, 15 people, 16 people with us?

464
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:17,545
Scott: Yup.

465
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:24,240
Rym: And across two rooms, we had like 16 people, and then we had like 20 other people scattered in other rooms.

466
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,379
Rym: We had like this giant posse of doom.

467
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,440
Rym: Mmm, giant posse.

468
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:34,340
Rym: Some people in the other peripheral groups had some drama, which we'll probably tell that story at some point, either today or next Thursday.

469
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,119
Scott: Mmm, oh, that story, okay.

470
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:41,980
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot of stories, because all our friends have drama, and we- This is why conventions are so great, because that's where you get all the stories from.

471
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,900
Rym: Yeah, I'd say more than half of our stories are from conventions.

472
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,260
Scott: And thinking about conventions, think about how much time we spend at conventions compared to time not at conventions.

473
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:55,500
Scott: The fact that there's more stories there than anywhere else, that just shows you why conventions are so awesome.

474
00:31:55,841 --> 00:32:01,960
Rym: I mean, I guess if you've never been to a convention, the main thing about them is that, like, look at your normal life.

475
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,919
Rym: You probably know a bunch of geeks around you, but not that many.

476
00:32:05,521 --> 00:32:07,679
Rym: And there's a lot of normal people in the way.

477
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,800
Rym: Imagine if you were in a small town for a weekend, and the only people there were geeks.

478
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:22,400
Rym: The only people there were cool people who are a lot like you and have similar interests, and you can just geek and yell and scream and dress up and do crazy things with no one caring.

479
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,599
Scott: Mmm, that's what it is.

480
00:32:24,721 --> 00:32:25,397
Scott: That's what it is.

481
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,019
Scott: And that's why you can't let anyone drag you down.

482
00:32:28,581 --> 00:32:31,998
Scott: And if you're someone trying to drag others down, just cut it out.

483
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,639
Scott: I mean, if you're not having a good time, you're upset.

484
00:32:36,941 --> 00:32:43,260
Scott: If you're trying to bring other people down, you're the asshole, not the people saying "get away from me" and not being sympathetic.

485
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,500
Rym: Because we've had both types.

486
00:32:45,262 --> 00:32:49,740
Rym: I mean, we had a friend once who came to a convention, she was having a really good time, but she actually got sick.

487
00:32:50,282 --> 00:32:50,580
Scott: Actually.

488
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:53,160
Rym: And there was no fault of her own, she was sick.

489
00:32:53,444 --> 00:32:54,173
Scott: And we did feel bad.

490
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,026
Rym: But she did the right thing.

491
00:32:57,066 --> 00:33:03,840
Rym: There was nothing we could do to help her, so she stayed in the room and recuperated, and we brought her food occasionally and made sure she was doing okay.

492
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:09,720
Rym: But she went out of her way to make sure that while she was sick, she didn't hurt anyone else along the process.

493
00:33:10,342 --> 00:33:11,820
Scott: And that's the way to do things at a con.

494
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,480
Rym: Yep, which brings back to bring quality people.

495
00:33:14,821 --> 00:33:18,280
Rym: If your friends are quality, they won't screw you just because they're having a bad day.

496
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,140
Scott: Alright, the next thing you gotta worry about at a con is registration.

497
00:33:22,722 --> 00:33:31,440
Rym: Yeah, now, basically it used to be the conventional wisdom, and this is like only three years ago, if that, where you didn't want to pre-register.

498
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:35,240
Rym: Because often the pre-registration line was slower and longer.

499
00:33:36,422 --> 00:33:39,340
Rym: Now, at least for anime conventions, this is not the case.

500
00:33:39,921 --> 00:33:42,579
Rym: And in fact, many of the big anime conventions sell out.

501
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:43,380
Rym: Yup.

502
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,479
Rym: Otakon sold out this year.

503
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:46,280
Rym: Yeah.

504
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,739
Rym: I voted NekoCon.

505
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,168
Rym: KatsuCon, it almost sold out.

506
00:33:50,189 --> 00:33:51,296
Rym: I don't know if it actually did sell out.

507
00:33:51,337 --> 00:33:51,780
Rym: I don't remember.

508
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:56,260
Scott: A lot of cons are having caps on their registration because they're selling out.

509
00:33:57,001 --> 00:34:01,120
Scott: So, pretty much if you don't pre-register, you're not, you're gonna have a very hard time getting in.

510
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:10,780
Scott: And a lot of them have things like Thursday registration, where if you pre-register, then you can get your badge on Thursday, which is a great idea, even though you have to pay one more night in a hotel.

511
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,793
Scott: You spend that many more hours having fun at the con.

512
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:14,579
Scott: It's totally worth it.

513
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:18,920
Scott: But you have to really, with registration, you have to consider two things.

514
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,188
Scott: Pre-registration usually gets you a discount.

515
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:25,739
Scott: You have to look at how big that discount is versus how much money you have.

516
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,978
Scott: You know, if it's really significant to get that pre-registration discount, go for it.

517
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,426
Scott: The second thing is how big the con is.

518
00:34:32,505 --> 00:34:36,659
Scott: If the con is crazy huge, pre-registration's probably a good idea.

519
00:34:37,621 --> 00:34:43,159
Scott: If the con is a little local con with, like, less than a thousand people or so, it doesn't really matter.

520
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,487
Scott: You just show up and you pay.

521
00:34:44,609 --> 00:34:45,172
Scott: Who cares?

522
00:34:45,233 --> 00:34:46,078
Scott: No one really does.

523
00:34:46,158 --> 00:34:46,400
Scott: Whatever.

524
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,005
Scott: And just make sure you do register.

525
00:34:50,045 --> 00:34:54,560
Scott: A lot of people, if you screw up registration, you could end up taking a long trip to nowhere.

526
00:34:55,464 --> 00:34:56,099
Scott: That's never good.

527
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:56,781
Rym: Yep.

528
00:34:57,121 --> 00:35:03,360
Rym: And in terms of registration, think about money, because this all costs money, and you're gonna have to, if you run out of money, it's bad.

529
00:35:03,481 --> 00:35:06,059
Rym: Because we actually ran out of money at a convention once.

530
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,600
Scott: That's pretty much the worst thing that can happen.

531
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:15,200
Rym: Yeah, the first Otakon we went to, we didn't really know what to expect, because our first convention, our first anime convention, was OhioCon.

532
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:23,120
Rym: And while I've heard OhioCon is a lot better now and is fairly awesome, when we went, this was like the worst convention ever.

533
00:35:23,901 --> 00:35:26,420
Scott: It was the first convention, anime convention I went to.

534
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,673
Rym: Yeah, it was the first anime con I'd ever gone to, too.

535
00:35:28,734 --> 00:35:29,700
Rym: And we went with a bunch of people.

536
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,260
Scott: I think it was the second OhioCon ever.

537
00:35:31,761 --> 00:35:32,142
Rym: It was.

538
00:35:32,162 --> 00:35:39,120
Rym: And it's really hard to describe without going into excruciating, painful detail why it was so bad.

539
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,000
Scott: We'll talk about it later.

540
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,019
Rym: Yeah, we'll do a whole show on that OhioCon.

541
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:45,300
Scott: Yeah, but let's just say that it wasn't the greatest experience.

542
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,889
Rym: So when we decided to go to Otakon, we didn't know what to expect.

543
00:35:48,929 --> 00:35:51,718
Rym: We didn't think that Otakon would be as insane as it was.

544
00:35:51,758 --> 00:35:52,400
Rym: We had no idea.

545
00:35:53,360 --> 00:36:04,720
Rym: And we show up, and I spent like, I had like $60 with me after the hotel, and I paid my $50 for a registration, and I had $10 with which to live the entire weekend and cover gas home.

546
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:05,348
Scott: Wow.

547
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,422
Rym: Yeah.

548
00:36:06,885 --> 00:36:09,739
Rym: We drove home without the air conditioning on to make sure we had enough gas.

549
00:36:10,741 --> 00:36:12,520
Scott: Oh, is that the one where I got lost in the woods?

550
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:21,360
Rym: Yeah, I fell asleep in the back of the car and you were driving, and then I woke up and you guys were in like the middle of the woods with an empty tank of gas and no lights, no street signs.

551
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:23,040
Scott: That was great.

552
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:23,461
Rym: Yeah.

553
00:36:24,306 --> 00:36:24,949
Rym: See, what did I tell you?

554
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,820
Rym: We have so many stories just because of these conventions.

555
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:31,160
Scott: Anyway, the next thing is transportation to the con.

556
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,062
Scott: Transportation is real tricky.

557
00:36:35,184 --> 00:36:40,751
Scott: If you live, I'd say more than five hours away, look into trains and planes.

558
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:47,980
Scott: If you can't afford trains and planes, you might want to reconsider going to this convention unless it's crazy huge and crazy awesome.

559
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:53,833
Rym: Yes, I mean people literally drive and fly and train from all over the world to Otakon.

560
00:36:54,554 --> 00:36:57,300
Rym: They don't come from all over the world to like Michicon.

561
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,920
Rym: So if you're flying eight hours to Michicon to see like 200 other people, you probably made a mistake.

562
00:37:05,061 --> 00:37:12,720
Scott: But just when you consider the distances, don't drive if it's too far because really no convention is worth the pain of that driving.

563
00:37:13,021 --> 00:37:16,511
Rym: Well, honestly, the furthest I've ever driven for a convention is.

564
00:37:16,591 --> 00:37:19,580
Rym: I drove from Rochester, New York to Chicago for Anime Central.

565
00:37:20,222 --> 00:37:21,120
Scott: That's not so bad.

566
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,760
Rym: It took 12 hours because the car broke down on the way.

567
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,646
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty much the limit.

568
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:28,800
Scott: And the con has to be pretty big to get you to do that.

569
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,505
Rym: Yep, it was well worth it.

570
00:37:30,545 --> 00:37:34,880
Rym: We're going to do a whole show on stories from cons because I just realized how many I have.

571
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:38,260
Scott: Yeah, I think we could probably do a whole bunch of shows on stories from cons.

572
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:48,240
Rym: Now, if you're going to take a train, and this really only applies to people in the Northeast Corridor and Amtrak, because in the rest of the country, as far as I'm concerned, Amtrak does not exist.

573
00:37:48,701 --> 00:37:49,085
Scott: It does.

574
00:37:49,105 --> 00:37:50,420
Scott: It's just slow and random.

575
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:55,610
Rym: It's not worth it unless you live in the Northeast, like pretty much anywhere around D.C.

576
00:37:55,711 --> 00:37:57,534
Rym: or the New York area or Pennsylvania.

577
00:37:57,554 --> 00:37:58,356
Rym: Amtrak's fine.

578
00:37:58,997 --> 00:38:00,220
Rym: Anywhere else, no.

579
00:38:01,021 --> 00:38:11,060
Scott: Well, you know, you might want to check it because sometimes you'll get lucky and there will happen to be a train that does exactly what you need, like Florida to, I don't know, somewhere.

580
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,585
Scott: You know, like North Carolina or something like that.

581
00:38:13,605 --> 00:38:14,888
Scott: Because there are trains that do that.

582
00:38:14,948 --> 00:38:19,560
Scott: But just check and if there isn't a train that's like perfect, don't even bother.

583
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:27,420
Rym: But the main thing with trains is to book, well one, look at the websites constantly and book like seriously six or seven months in advance.

584
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,468
Rym: Because the next time we went to ASEN, we decided driving is stupid.

585
00:38:32,528 --> 00:38:33,490
Rym: We're going to take Amtrak.

586
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:35,294
Rym: And we took a 12 hour Amtrak.

587
00:38:35,614 --> 00:38:38,300
Rym: But it was only like 60 bucks because we got some crazy deal.

588
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,045
Rym: If you don't get a crazy deal like that, you might be better off flying or driving.

589
00:38:43,248 --> 00:38:49,540
Rym: Flying is always real tricky because for a convention, you usually bring a lot of stuff with you and bring even more stuff back with you.

590
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,440
Rym: And the conventions are never actually near an airport.

591
00:38:54,421 --> 00:39:02,040
Scott: One thing to note is that Otakon kind of is okay to fly to because they have a post office at the con and you just mail things to yourself.

592
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:07,440
Scott: So instead of carrying them home on the plane, you just mail your stuff home and then get on the plane with whatever you want.

593
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,504
Scott: But that's very, very, very rare.

594
00:39:10,524 --> 00:39:13,128
Scott: And Otakon is the only con I know of that has that.

595
00:39:13,589 --> 00:39:20,060
Scott: So don't fly to a con with a bunch of crap if it's not really, really worth it.

596
00:39:20,701 --> 00:39:25,109
Rym: Driving is your best bet because you really want to bring a lot of extra stuff to the con just in case.

597
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:30,460
Rym: Extra pillows, extra blankets, extra towels, which we'll get into when we talk about how to overstuff a hotel room.

598
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,226
Scott: Oh god.

599
00:39:31,691 --> 00:39:32,339
Scott: I think that's next.

600
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:33,702
Rym: Yup, yup.

601
00:39:33,963 --> 00:39:36,632
Rym: But transportation, most people drive to cons.

602
00:39:37,154 --> 00:39:38,560
Rym: And there are a number of things to be aware of.

603
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:47,880
Rym: First of all, once again talking about reliable people, be real wary of who you're driving with and whether or not they're prepared to go.

604
00:39:48,681 --> 00:39:51,987
Scott: You gotta make sure, number one, perfect directions.

605
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:58,100
Scott: If your directions aren't flawless, I wouldn't get in a car with someone who wasn't 100% sure they knew exactly where they were going.

606
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:01,970
Rym: I mean if you're going in a carpool, make one person the directions person.

607
00:40:02,231 --> 00:40:05,500
Rym: And they give everyone the same directions and there's a cell phone in every car.

608
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,944
Scott: And make that person responsible.

609
00:40:09,004 --> 00:40:14,153
Scott: So if anyone gets lost, make sure you know who to blame when things go wrong.

610
00:40:14,213 --> 00:40:17,960
Scott: If the directions are bad, make sure you give that person what for.

611
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:26,171
Rym: Because when we plan conventions, I guess part of the reason we have such success and a lot of our friends have had trouble is that we actually sit down and plan.

612
00:40:26,431 --> 00:40:32,360
Rym: Pen and paper specifically, duties are assigned and responsibilities and blames are laid.

613
00:40:33,221 --> 00:40:36,266
Rym: Like we have a thing we always say, like Scott says he's going to do something.

614
00:40:36,326 --> 00:40:37,868
Rym: I say, "Alright Scott, that's all

615
00:40:37,908 --> 00:40:38,108
Rym: you.".

616
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,131
Rym: We're serious about that.

617
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:45,940
Rym: That means whatever consequences come of Scott's action, they are his to deal with and his to take blame for.

618
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:54,216
Scott: It's basically like, "Alright, you can try that crazy thing, but I don't have confidence in it so you're taking full responsibility if you want to go for

619
00:40:54,276 --> 00:40:54,356
Scott: it.".

620
00:40:55,038 --> 00:40:56,040
Scott: That's what all you means.

621
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:03,952
Scott: So when someone says all you, a lot of times you're just dissuaded from even doing it at all.

622
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:08,060
Scott: Of course it's great when you do it and it works and the other person does it.

623
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:13,780
Rym: Now regarding that, I highly recommend that you don't try to caravan a bunch of cars together.

624
00:41:14,401 --> 00:41:15,820
Scott: That's a very, very bad idea.

625
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,284
Rym: Now there are a number of reasons for that.

626
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:22,760
Rym: One, I have an anecdote that is fairly detailed and gives you a good picture of exactly what can go wrong.

627
00:41:23,484 --> 00:41:26,360
Scott: I think telling the anecdote actually just gives all the stuff we want to say.

628
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:30,350
Rym: Yeah, so basically we were going to Otakon.

629
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,516
Rym: It was the first Otakon we went to.

630
00:41:32,536 --> 00:41:33,960
Rym: Yeah, it was the first one.

631
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:40,340
Rym: And this con, because the hotel screwed off, it was just a disaster from the start.

632
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,805
Rym: But we were going to drive on our own.

633
00:41:43,186 --> 00:41:47,858
Rym: Everyone was going to meet us at the hotel room that we all had and we decided that, "Alright, we'll all go on our

634
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:48,019
Rym: own.".

635
00:41:48,681 --> 00:41:51,149
Rym: But a bunch of our friends said, "No, we should carpool together.

636
00:41:51,169 --> 00:41:51,831
Rym: It'll be fun.

637
00:41:51,871 --> 00:41:54,079
Rym: We'll stop on the road and we'll hang out and blah blah

638
00:41:54,099 --> 00:41:54,279
Rym: blah.".

639
00:41:55,241 --> 00:41:56,724
Rym: So we agreed that, "Alright, fine.

640
00:41:57,165 --> 00:41:58,669
Rym: We're going to leave at X time.

641
00:41:58,969 --> 00:42:02,518
Rym: You can follow us if you want, but once again I'll note that I

642
00:42:02,558 --> 00:42:02,879
Rym: speed.".

643
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,266
Rym: And when I say I speed, I speed.

644
00:42:06,286 --> 00:42:12,560
Rym: I mean, I quite literally go about 100 miles an hour in the left lane as fast as I can go down the entirety of a freeway.

645
00:42:13,202 --> 00:42:20,559
Scott: Now, a lot of people, whatever you want to say about speeding, we can talk about that in another podcast because we're going to put you down so fast.

646
00:42:21,941 --> 00:42:29,340
Scott: The point is, is that every minute you're saving by speeding, going 100 miles an hour or more, is another minute at the con.

647
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,890
Scott: And the ticket is worth it.

648
00:42:32,191 --> 00:42:33,920
Scott: Especially, you know, it doesn't matter.

649
00:42:34,561 --> 00:42:41,160
Rym: I mean, it really adds up because I used to drive a lot between Detroit and Rochester and if I sped, I'd make it in about four hours.

650
00:42:41,864 --> 00:42:44,359
Rym: If I drove the speed limit, it took about seven hours.

651
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,279
Scott: Three hours is worth a lot of my...

652
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,140
Rym: Yeah, especially when you're only going somewhere for a weekend.

653
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,960
Scott: Yeah, definitely.

654
00:42:51,601 --> 00:42:52,244
Scott: So, whatever.

655
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:53,087
Rym: They say, "Alright,

656
00:42:53,127 --> 00:42:53,429
Rym: fine.".

657
00:42:54,051 --> 00:42:54,935
Rym: I said, "Alright, we're leaving at 6, 6

658
00:42:54,935 --> 00:42:55,035
Rym: AM.".

659
00:42:56,402 --> 00:42:58,255
Rym: And they're like, "Alright, meet us at our house and then we'll

660
00:42:58,295 --> 00:42:58,375
Rym: go.".

661
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:02,151
Rym: So we show up at their house at 6 AM, ready to go.

662
00:43:02,171 --> 00:43:04,699
Rym: We expect them to get in their car and come with us.

663
00:43:06,121 --> 00:43:09,260
Rym: Not only are they not awake, but they have not packed.

664
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:09,424
Scott: Great.

665
00:43:10,405 --> 00:43:10,680
Scott: Great.

666
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,104
Rym: That was awesome.

667
00:43:12,806 --> 00:43:16,440
Rym: So, you know, being reasonable people, we waited and that was our first mistake.

668
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,180
Rym: We should have cut loose immediately.

669
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,248
Scott: We should have just said, "Oh, you're not ready.

670
00:43:20,288 --> 00:43:21,896
Scott: We thought you'd be ready at 6 and you're not.

671
00:43:21,996 --> 00:43:22,499
Scott: Well, see

672
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:22,579
Scott: ya.".

673
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:22,850
Scott: Boom.

674
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,319
Scott: That's what we should have done.

675
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:24,840
Rym: Yep.

676
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:25,843
Rym: Just remember this.

677
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:34,740
Rym: Whenever there's a problem, unless you have a reason to help the person, like they're your good friend or you screwed up, like it's your fault that they're having a problem and not their own fault.

678
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,399
Rym: Yep, yep, yep.

679
00:43:35,802 --> 00:43:40,120
Rym: But if it's their own fault and they're going to detract from the con, you really got to cut loose.

680
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,010
Scott: Mm-hmm.

681
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:46,000
Rym: So we waited and they finally get all their stuff together and then one of them decides to lead us to the freeway.

682
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:49,840
Rym: Well, he didn't know how to get to the freeway and led us in the middle of nowhere.

683
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:50,720
Rym: Great.

684
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:51,582
Rym: Great.

685
00:43:51,602 --> 00:43:56,860
Rym: So I passed all of them, flashed my Brights and my Flashers and followed me and I took everyone to the freeway and then we're going.

686
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,603
Rym: So we're on the freeway.

687
00:43:59,166 --> 00:44:01,856
Rym: I get up to about 75 and one of them calls us.

688
00:44:02,178 --> 00:44:02,660
Rym: Slow down.

689
00:44:05,523 --> 00:44:05,645
Scott: Yeah.

690
00:44:05,705 --> 00:44:07,159
Scott: We're probably not going to slow down.

691
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:07,780
Rym: Yeah.

692
00:44:07,981 --> 00:44:12,900
Rym: So we slowed down a little, but we kept inching up and they eventually followed us around 75.

693
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:16,820
Rym: Even though I really wanted to be going about 100, but they wouldn't follow and whatever.

694
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:22,520
Rym: So then finally, we're about an hour and a half on the road and all of us have to pee.

695
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:23,208
Rym: Mm-hmm.

696
00:44:23,581 --> 00:44:24,819
Rym: So we decide to stop and pee.

697
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,609
Scott: Stopping and peeing is okay, but make it quick.

698
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:29,720
Scott: Stop at the rest stop, go and pee, get out.

699
00:44:30,242 --> 00:44:35,560
Rym: So while we're stopped and peeing, people in the other cars decide they want to stop at this little diner there and eat breakfast.

700
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,752
Scott: It's not even like a diner that I would eat at ever.

701
00:44:38,772 --> 00:44:39,956
Scott: It was like a trucker diner.

702
00:44:40,057 --> 00:44:40,780
Scott: It was kind of scary.

703
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:46,540
Rym: Yeah, but two, it's real important to remember that you really shouldn't stop on your way to a convention.

704
00:44:47,543 --> 00:44:48,879
Scott: Unless you absolutely have to.

705
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:57,780
Rym: Yeah, but I mean, don't stop and eat breakfast on the way because you're much better off getting to the con and then hanging out with a bunch of people and eating breakfast or lunch with them.

706
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:07,300
Scott: Yeah, I mean, if you're really, if you're going early in the morning, which is what you're probably going to do because you're going to take the day off work, you pack the night before, you wake up at the crack of dawn.

707
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:17,420
Scott: If you need food, eat a breakfast at home or go to a diner like right in your hometown, then get in the car, get on the highway and go and do not stop until you get there.

708
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:23,280
Scott: And then once you're there and you get into the hotel and all that nice stuff, then you can go eat and hang out with people.

709
00:45:23,802 --> 00:45:27,680
Scott: You know, it's a lot more fun than eating with people on the road in some crummy place.

710
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:31,580
Rym: So the three cars are at this diner and they all say they want to eat.

711
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:36,932
Rym: So there are three of us in my car and we all agree that, all right, we're cutting the rope.

712
00:45:37,292 --> 00:45:37,914
Rym: Goodbye.

713
00:45:38,174 --> 00:45:38,615
Rym: Good luck.

714
00:45:38,656 --> 00:45:39,538
Rym: You have the directions.

715
00:45:39,598 --> 00:45:40,500
Rym: We get back on the road.

716
00:45:41,583 --> 00:45:42,712
Rym: They are all pissed at us.

717
00:45:42,913 --> 00:45:43,296
Rym: And you know what?

718
00:45:43,316 --> 00:45:43,740
Rym: That's fine.

719
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:45,759
Scott: We ended up getting there.

720
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,198
Rym: Three hours before them.

721
00:45:48,802 --> 00:45:49,605
Scott: Three hours.

722
00:45:49,825 --> 00:45:50,347
Scott: And you know what?

723
00:45:50,388 --> 00:45:53,640
Scott: Those were convention hours because it was a Friday, right?

724
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:54,268
Rym: Yup.

725
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,831
Scott: So we ended up getting three more hours of convention than they did.

726
00:45:58,851 --> 00:46:01,900
Scott: They pretty much didn't get any convention whatsoever on Friday.

727
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,286
Rym: Because we got there at noon.

728
00:46:04,607 --> 00:46:09,260
Rym: We checked into the hotel, which is a whole other story because the hotel was almost a disaster.

729
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:10,899
Scott: Yeah, we'll tell that story another time.

730
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:22,240
Rym: Yes, but we check into the hotel and then a bunch of our friends who are already in town call us and we all got together and got like breakfast, lunch at a bagel place and hung out and got our badges and had a good time for three hours.

731
00:46:23,441 --> 00:46:30,980
Rym: And then they showed up three hours later, miserable and hungry and tired and they'd missed the con and they hadn't had their food yet and they didn't have their badges or anything.

732
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:33,699
Scott: And being illogical, they blamed it on us.

733
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:34,540
Rym: Yeah.

734
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,925
Scott: Don't blame your own failings on someone else.

735
00:46:38,005 --> 00:46:44,600
Scott: I mean, you know, while we might feel sorry for you that, you know, yeah, you didn't have a fun time and that sucks.

736
00:46:45,281 --> 00:46:47,448
Scott: It's not our fault that you didn't have a fun time.

737
00:46:47,488 --> 00:46:50,959
Scott: It's your fault and we're not going to let you drag us down, you know.

738
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:55,099
Scott: Yeah, this dragging down thing, I think we've pretty much hammered it in.

739
00:46:55,481 --> 00:46:57,460
Rym: Yeah, but we see it happen to so many people.

740
00:46:57,761 --> 00:47:03,140
Rym: I mean, we've got some friends who when they hear this, they're probably going to call in and be like, oh, this happened to me, blah, blah, blah.

741
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:05,560
Rym: And they'll tell you a story that's even worse than the ones we've been telling.

742
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:10,400
Scott: Yeah, I've heard stories about people going to cons with like people from school or with different groups.

743
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:27,820
Rym: We're talking like fistfights in the rooms, molestations, money and food and jewelry being stolen, hotels not having the rooms because the person didn't actually get the reservations, people getting lost and actually not making it to the con.

744
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:30,788
Scott: Yeah, don't let anyone drag you down.

745
00:47:30,809 --> 00:47:32,860
Scott: I think we've hammered it in.

746
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,760
Rym: That's pretty much the primary lesson here.

747
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,823
Scott: The next thing is your hotel.

748
00:47:38,003 --> 00:47:47,760
Scott: Now, you're going to want to, depending on where the con is and how full it's going to be, you have to get the hotel well enough in advance to make sure you actually get a room.

749
00:47:48,200 --> 00:48:01,258
Rym: Now, for Otakon, Katsu, not so much KatsuCon, but for Otakon, Anime Central and Anime Boston and NekoCon, I'm not kidding when I say that six months in advance is probably the latest.

750
00:48:01,318 --> 00:48:02,360
Rym: you want to think about this.

751
00:48:03,461 --> 00:48:03,662
Scott: Yeah.

752
00:48:03,682 --> 00:48:06,490
Scott: Now, for a hotel, you're going to want to look at price.

753
00:48:07,011 --> 00:48:10,240
Scott: You're going to want to look at proximity to the con.

754
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:26,460
Scott: If it's far away from the con, it's probably not the greatest idea because you won't be able to easily walk back and forth in case you really have stuff that you need to move around or you suddenly need to change clothes or maybe you're a big cosplayer, you want to change your costumes and stuff.

755
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:31,734
Rym: Well, it depends on what kind of con it is too because some cons run 24/7 and some cons don't.

756
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:40,899
Rym: And two, a lot of people use the logic of vacations where you pick the crappiest, cheapest hotel room because all you're going to do is sleep in it.

757
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:47,020
Rym: But honestly, at cons, despite how much fun you're having, you're going to go back to the room more often than you think to just chill with people.

758
00:48:48,262 --> 00:48:50,820
Rym: And you really want the room to not be a cesspool.

759
00:48:51,602 --> 00:48:56,900
Scott: The other thing is, hotels will always tell you this room has an occupancy of blah, alright?

760
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:05,860
Scott: Basically, while you can get in trouble for breaking that rule, lie to the hotel and tell them you have whatever the maximum occupancy is.

761
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:09,076
Scott: So if it's a four people room with a double bed, say you have four people.

762
00:49:09,136 --> 00:49:09,760
Scott: Just tell them that.

763
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:15,180
Scott: But bring as many people as you can fit in there comfortably and divide the price among you.

764
00:49:15,581 --> 00:49:17,084
Rym: Now, it really depends on the hotel.

765
00:49:17,224 --> 00:49:24,800
Rym: Like, the Renaissance Hotel in Baltimore, where we usually stay, I'm not kidding when I say that their normal room can comfortably sleep eight.

766
00:49:26,142 --> 00:49:29,558
Rym: And it can sleep ten if you're a little younger and a little spryer.

767
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:36,920
Rym: And one big trick is that if you've got a lot of people, instead of getting a suite, get two rooms and ask for them to be adjoining.

768
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,366
Rym: And you can open the little door between the two rooms.

769
00:49:40,028 --> 00:49:43,500
Rym: You wouldn't believe how much more space that actually ends up giving you.

770
00:49:44,442 --> 00:49:44,805
Scott: It's great.

771
00:49:44,886 --> 00:49:46,680
Scott: You can even get, like, three rooms adjoining.

772
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:48,667
Rym: That's what we did for this coming Otakon.

773
00:49:48,707 --> 00:49:50,253
Rym: We have three rooms adjoining.

774
00:49:51,517 --> 00:49:52,220
Rym: It's gonna be nuts.

775
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:52,820
Scott: Yeah.

776
00:49:53,161 --> 00:49:57,148
Scott: Now, if it's a smaller con than Otakon, usually they're cons in hotels.

777
00:49:57,509 --> 00:50:03,200
Scott: You're probably gonna want a room in that hotel because then you can keep going back to it all the time and you can do all sorts of crazy stuff.

778
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:09,620
Rym: But at the same time, you can cram more people into the room because a lot of people are probably gonna spend all night hanging out in the con.

779
00:50:09,921 --> 00:50:10,121
Scott: Yup.

780
00:50:11,024 --> 00:50:16,040
Scott: And, you know, like at Otakon, you pretty much have to leave the con, go back to your hotel, and sleep at night.

781
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:16,670
Rym: Yup.

782
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:23,473
Scott: For the cons with the hotel room in the con, usually your hotel room turns into a party room at night.

783
00:50:23,513 --> 00:50:24,956
Scott: There isn't a lot of sleeping going on.

784
00:50:24,996 --> 00:50:26,780
Scott: It just turns into, like, a stuffed storage bin.

785
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,360
Scott: So you don't need to get as big a room when you have something like that.

786
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:29,821
Rym: Yup.

787
00:50:30,041 --> 00:50:35,120
Rym: Though if you actually want to throw a party in your room, like, not just people are hanging out, but we are having a party.

788
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,059
Scott: Public, you know, with public admittance.

789
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:43,300
Rym: We're gonna do a separate bid on that another day because we've done it many times and we can tell you exactly how to do it.

790
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,447
Rym: And let me just say that it is not for the faint of hearted.

791
00:50:46,467 --> 00:50:51,260
Rym: It is not easy, it is not trivial, you will get screwed, but it might be fun anyway.

792
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:53,560
Scott: You have to get the biggest room you can.

793
00:50:53,880 --> 00:51:02,480
Rym: Yeah, and you have to expect to spend money, and you have to be the kind of person who has no trouble lying through their teeth to a police officer.

794
00:51:04,541 --> 00:51:09,534
Scott: Now, so, to get a hotel room, figure out the best hotel proximity and price.

795
00:51:09,815 --> 00:51:11,600
Scott: Figure out how many rooms you're gonna need.

796
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:18,280
Scott: Make sure you call well enough in advance, you know, for the con, because the hotels will be sold out for big cons.

797
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,219
Rym: I mean, Otakon, three of the hotels are already sold out.

798
00:51:21,803 --> 00:51:22,412
Scott: For what, August?

799
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,620
Rym: Yes, for this coming August.

800
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:25,860
Scott: That's eight months away.

801
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:31,040
Rym: In fact, two of the hotels sold out within two weeks of the con ending last summer.

802
00:51:31,161 --> 00:51:32,533
Scott: So it was twelve months prior.

803
00:51:32,775 --> 00:51:33,400
Scott: Yeah, great.

804
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:37,856
Rym: There were people calling hotels at the con for the next year.

805
00:51:38,298 --> 00:51:38,860
Rym: I'm not kidding.

806
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:48,680
Scott: So, get them well enough in advance, make sure that you call the hotel, like, let's say you order the room four months in advance.

807
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:55,080
Scott: Call them two months later to make sure and confirm the rooms, then call them the week before the con and confirm the rooms.

808
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:59,200
Rym: Yes, and even then, when you get there, check in and confirm what you're getting.

809
00:51:59,541 --> 00:52:04,320
Rym: Because remember when I said that when we showed up three hours before our friends and we checked in, the hotel was a disaster?

810
00:52:05,302 --> 00:52:07,620
Rym: We checked in, and they gave us the key to our room.

811
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,920
Rym: Now, we had ordered a giant suite, because we had, like, twelve people come.

812
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,100
Scott: With an upstairs and a downstairs.

813
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:15,917
Rym: Yes, this hotel room has two stories inside of it, and it had, like, these utenna windows.

814
00:52:15,977 --> 00:52:16,580
Rym: It was awesome.

815
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:20,599
Rym: So we go to our room, and we open it, and it's just a tiny little room.

816
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:22,519
Rym: What the hell?

817
00:52:22,901 --> 00:52:26,837
Rym: So we go back to the front desk, and we're like, "Alright, bitches, we ordered a

818
00:52:26,917 --> 00:52:27,279
Rym: suite.".

819
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:32,419
Rym: And they're all, "Yeah, suite, uh, sold out, uh, we're

820
00:52:32,459 --> 00:52:32,700
Rym: dumb.".

821
00:52:33,523 --> 00:52:34,027
Rym: And we're like,

822
00:52:34,047 --> 00:52:34,148
Rym: "Great.".

823
00:52:36,104 --> 00:52:37,639
Scott: They ended up giving us, uh...

824
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:42,660
Rym: They gave us the guest suite, like the presidential whatever suite, for a discount.

825
00:52:43,101 --> 00:52:47,080
Rym: And they worked it out with us, because we were a large group of angry people who was going to raise hell.

826
00:52:47,943 --> 00:52:52,979
Rym: But I'll warn you that if something like that screws up, the hotel is not obligated to serve you in any way.

827
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:56,040
Rym: Hotels are not obligated to keep your reservation.

828
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,319
Rym: So keep on them and make sure you've got it.

829
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:04,860
Scott: Yeah, basically be an ass to the hotel, and keep pushing them and pushing them to make sure that what you have is right.

830
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:12,660
Scott: And there should be someone in your group who's the designated hotel-doing person, which is probably the most responsible person.

831
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:15,900
Rym: Now, make sure, one, that that person has a credit card.

832
00:53:16,183 --> 00:53:17,639
Rym: Because you have to secure the room.

833
00:53:18,702 --> 00:53:21,980
Rym: And if you have multiple rooms, you have to secure them all separately.

834
00:53:23,442 --> 00:53:26,780
Rym: And we actually have to split that between two of us, because I only had one credit card.

835
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:31,119
Rym: And because of various things on it, it could only secure one room at a time.

836
00:53:31,681 --> 00:53:34,339
Rym: Because they reserve a lot of money on your card to reserve a room.

837
00:53:35,243 --> 00:53:36,659
Rym: Because they're worried about breakage and such.

838
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:43,140
Rym: Now, as for paying for the room, basically, there are two ways to look at this.

839
00:53:43,521 --> 00:53:48,380
Rym: We trust our close friends completely, so we don't make them pay right away at all, whatever.

840
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,240
Rym: We just trust that they'll give us the money, and they all give us the money.

841
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:58,800
Rym: If there is any shadow of a doubt whatsoever, and even if they're close friends, make them pay in advance.

842
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:04,760
Rym: Either before you book the room in cash, or make them pay before you let them into the room.

843
00:54:05,661 --> 00:54:10,660
Rym: Because if someone's unreliable, and they don't pay you right away, they're never going to pay you.

844
00:54:11,101 --> 00:54:17,000
Scott: And you'll just end up having to pay hundreds of dollars to this hotel room, and someone else stayed in it for free on your bill.

845
00:54:18,365 --> 00:54:18,859
Scott: That's not good.

846
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:23,440
Rym: Be wary of people who just say they might come, and then they show up, and they want a place to crash.

847
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,800
Rym: Because that means they don't want to pay you anything, but they want to use your shower and bed.

848
00:54:27,801 --> 00:54:30,620
Rym: Now, we've never actually had this happen, but a lot of our friends have.

849
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:36,720
Rym: So this is just kind of a warning to, even though you might all be friends, work out the money ahead of time.

850
00:54:36,981 --> 00:54:39,360
Rym: Because it's real easy to lose friends over stupid things like money.

851
00:54:39,641 --> 00:54:47,500
Scott: Yep, so, checking in, you get to the hotel, you go right to the desk, you say you want to check in, you get your keys, you go to your room, you put your stuff in it.

852
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:53,114
Scott: You make sure that, you know, you keep count of people in the room, you keep track of those keys.

853
00:54:53,475 --> 00:54:55,260
Scott: Holy crap, you keep track of those keys.

854
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:59,980
Rym: Yes, if the wrong people have your keys, they'll disappear, and you can't get into the room, and you're fucked.

855
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:08,540
Scott: Make sure that whoever actually paid for the room, the hotel person, you know, whoever's the most responsible guy, he's got to have a key, whoever it is.

856
00:55:08,941 --> 00:55:09,623
Scott: Two?

857
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:13,337
Rym: Usually, you might think, "Oh, I'll give the key to the two most responsible

858
00:55:13,377 --> 00:55:13,658
Rym: people."

859
00:55:14,302 --> 00:55:16,120
Rym: Or the two people who are, like, running the event.

860
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:18,244
Rym: That's always me and Scott.

861
00:55:19,026 --> 00:55:23,660
Rym: So, it's kind of stupid for both of us to have keys, because we're both usually together at the con.

862
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:29,760
Rym: Great, so make sure you spread the keys out in a way that will inconvenience the key holders the least.

863
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:36,780
Rym: Like, if someone is a diabetic, or someone has asthma, or someone has a reason to go to the room often, they should have a key.

864
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:44,080
Scott: And, let's say there's, like, three people that are pretty much going to hang out with each other at the con, give one of those three people a key.

865
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,664
Scott: The most responsible of the three people a key.

866
00:55:47,265 --> 00:55:54,840
Scott: You know, because, you know, they'll probably be going back to the room together, and, you know, if they're not going to split up, then why give them two keys?

867
00:55:55,340 --> 00:56:04,180
Rym: Now, we used to have a lot of stuff to say about, like, radios, or how to keep in touch with people, or rendezvous points, but honestly, that's made completely moot by cell phones.

868
00:56:04,441 --> 00:56:07,500
Scott: Cell phones and Nintendo DSes pretty much eliminate any need for that.

869
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,204
Rym: Yeah, everyone we knew had a cell phone, and we all just call each other.

870
00:56:10,765 --> 00:56:19,480
Rym: Now, the one drawback of that is that, at least for us, pretty much, my phone rang about every fifteen minutes for the entire convention.

871
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:31,920
Rym: I just, like, I just set it to mute, and then I'd look, and, like, ten people have called me, trying to get into the room, or trying to find out when we're going to eat dinner, or telling me that they found something cool, or, yeah.

872
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:33,049
Rym: That's just my rant.

873
00:56:33,109 --> 00:56:34,139
Rym: That's not actually anything useful.

874
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:38,960
Scott: I get just about as many calls at cons, just from other people at the con, all over the place, doing stuff.

875
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:39,622
Scott: "Where are you?

876
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:40,565
Scott: Let's meet up and eat.

877
00:56:40,725 --> 00:56:42,491
Scott: Oh, my God, you have to come to this event.

878
00:56:42,551 --> 00:56:43,634
Scott: You know, this is going on.

879
00:56:43,654 --> 00:56:44,376
Scott: Do you want to do this?

880
00:56:44,798 --> 00:56:45,460
Scott: Oh, I saw something

881
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:45,600
Scott: crazy.".

882
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:46,301
Scott: Well, I

883
00:56:46,321 --> 00:57:05,400
Rym: guess the warning there is that, if you want to be the people like us, the ones who organize this for your group of friends, because someone has to do it, or you're going to have drama, be wary that your friends, while they're your friends, will become energy leeches, and will draw all of your energy, efforts, and attention for much of the con, managing them.

884
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:09,067
Scott: It's a good thing that, most of the time, the conventions are loud, and I can't hear my phone ring.

885
00:57:09,167 --> 00:57:15,460
Scott: So I just, I don't pick it up, not because I don't want to, but because I just don't, I really don't hear it sometimes at the con, which I guess is good.

886
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,486
Scott: You know, because then I pick it up later, and I go, "Oh, someone called

887
00:57:18,527 --> 00:57:19,048
Scott: whatever.".

888
00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:23,240
Scott: You know, and usually it's not super important, and if it is, they'll call again and again.

889
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:31,820
Rym: Now, we went real long, so we're going to wrap this up for now, but we're going to start up, where this is going to be a series every Thursday until we finish this.

890
00:57:32,281 --> 00:57:37,620
Scott: I think we might finish it next week, we're going to talk about what to do actually when you're at the con.

891
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:44,920
Rym: Yep, I'm also, next week, I want to talk about specifically how to cram a lot of people in a hotel room without getting kicked out, and without having a problem.

892
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,779
Rym: Because there's a lot of info there.

893
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:47,371
Scott: Yep.

894
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:54,420
Rym: Alright, so stay tuned next week, tell us your funny con stories, we'll probably play them if they're funny enough.

895
00:57:54,681 --> 00:57:57,147
Scott: And have fun if you're going to any convention soon.

896
00:57:57,187 --> 00:58:02,720
Scott: I think the next con I'm going to is probably going to be the New York City Comic Con in the Javits Center in February.

897
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:10,560
Rym: Yep, and I'm going to be at Katsu Con, and I may or may not be on a panel, and if I'm not on a panel, I have a friend who's definitely going to be on a panel.

898
00:58:11,101 --> 00:58:11,699
Scott: Alright, awesome.

899
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,789
Rym: And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
