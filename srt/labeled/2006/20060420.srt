1
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,672
Rym: It's Thursday April 20th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:12,692 --> 00:00:15,000
Rym: We're going to tell you how to get a job.

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:21,516
Scott: Let's do this, so I'm still not doing work at work, and they continue to pay me.

4
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:23,727
Rym: and yeah What are you gonna?

5
00:00:23,747 --> 00:00:25,419
Rym: Do if they start listening to GeekNights?

6
00:00:27,522 --> 00:00:30,056
Scott: I don't think they'll ever find it and if they do I'll just quit.

7
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,893
Rym: well I got to say my co-workers all found it and they listened to it once.

8
00:00:33,953 --> 00:00:36,831
Rym: they couldn't believe I do something like that And I think they all forgot about it.

9
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,586
Rym: That's good Yeah, especially considering.

10
00:00:39,687 --> 00:00:42,658
Scott: I'm quitting and yesterday you insulted them.

11
00:00:43,099 --> 00:00:46,450
Scott: Yes I did quite uh profoundly and I insulted them, and I didn't even know them.

12
00:00:46,851 --> 00:00:47,032
Rym: Yep.

13
00:00:47,132 --> 00:00:48,255
Rym: Well you met one of them once.

14
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:52,893
Scott: yeah great But yeah today since there was still no work.

15
00:00:53,938 --> 00:00:57,653
Scott: I Did some learning of Ruby on Rails.

16
00:00:57,693 --> 00:01:02,514
Scott: cuz I'm gonna make some Web-based board games cuz I'm not gonna work for them.

17
00:01:02,554 --> 00:01:03,277
Scott: I'm gonna work for me.

18
00:01:03,337 --> 00:01:03,598
Scott: damn it.

19
00:01:04,961 --> 00:01:16,140
Scott: So you know if I don't start getting work in the next few months you should start seeing a cool thing I'm gonna make and I'm simultaneously learning all this Ruby on Rails Ajax crap.

20
00:01:17,422 --> 00:01:18,328
Rym: Yeah, the most exciting thing.

21
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:24,048
Rym: I did today was watch some Futurama Whoa That's pretty low.

22
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:26,820
Rym: well and do a show and I guess pack for Tarkan.

23
00:01:27,181 --> 00:01:30,015
Rym: I got to put all the audio equipment away as soon as we're done recording tonight.

24
00:01:30,035 --> 00:01:31,039
Scott: Yeah already packed.

25
00:01:31,704 --> 00:01:34,891
Scott: Well at least I have a pile of clothes in the middle of my room But I just had to stick them in the bag.

26
00:01:35,355 --> 00:01:35,839
Scott: That's good enough.

27
00:01:36,801 --> 00:01:37,764
Rym: So we got some news right.

28
00:01:38,305 --> 00:01:46,104
Scott: yep, so there was a hubbub on dig today And I don't know if anyone noticed But it was pretty big.

29
00:01:46,405 --> 00:01:51,360
Rym: this hubbub even though it wasn't actually big on dig it was big on every other site on the internet.

30
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,187
Scott: Well, that's part of what the hubbub is yep.

31
00:01:53,568 --> 00:01:55,355
Rym: I don't know what the dig editors were thinking.

32
00:01:55,455 --> 00:02:00,745
Scott: I mean everyone read it all right, so Apparently I'm just gonna get.

33
00:02:00,785 --> 00:02:04,600
Scott: I'm not gonna give the specifics because those aren't really too interesting and you give the general idea.

34
00:02:05,182 --> 00:02:26,406
Scott: The way dig works is you anyone can submit as many stories as they want and then if you like a story you click Dig and and there's a number attached to the story that goes up by one and if the number gets high enough Then it'll be easier for people to find it and if the number gets high enough it gets out of the front page And then once it's on the front page It usually gets a hajillion digs, and then whatever

35
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:35,643
Rym: think slashdot only with much more democracy and thus much less control or I don't know Insightfulness in many cases.

36
00:02:35,924 --> 00:02:39,050
Scott: Yeah, it has its good points, and it's bad points kind of like Wikipedia.

37
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:46,249
Scott: and The way to get rid of a story is if a story is bad You can report it and you could report stories as inaccurate.

38
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:47,893
Scott: you can report stories as lame.

39
00:02:48,275 --> 00:02:50,080
Scott: you can report stories as old.

40
00:02:50,563 --> 00:02:51,735
Scott: There's all kinds of things right.

41
00:02:52,763 --> 00:03:00,119
Scott: I said if a story gets reported too much Then they'll bury it and that basically no matter how many digs it has they'll just bury it to the bottom.

42
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:05,980
Scott: now There have been some stories recently that say bad things about dig.

43
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:11,577
Scott: so Apparently these stories aren't making it up dig.

44
00:03:11,597 --> 00:03:15,696
Rym: well they are making it up dig until they are noticed and then they're buried.

45
00:03:15,716 --> 00:03:27,036
Scott: yeah, and Also, it seems that certain stories like this guy noticed that there were two stories on the front page and They were both submitted by the same guy.

46
00:03:27,056 --> 00:03:32,880
Scott: now You know either this guy is really good at finding news or really good at writing headlines or something.

47
00:03:33,662 --> 00:03:37,755
Scott: But he noticed something strange about these two stories submitted by the same guy first off.

48
00:03:38,277 --> 00:03:41,849
Scott: They're submitted Very close to each other time wise.

49
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,477
Scott: so he submitted them all you know.

50
00:03:43,497 --> 00:03:47,765
Scott: like he submitted one then we submit the other one and Then on the front page there in fact.

51
00:03:47,785 --> 00:03:49,993
Scott: There's only one story between these two stories.

52
00:03:50,174 --> 00:03:50,856
Scott: that what you know.

53
00:03:51,779 --> 00:03:53,225
Scott: and He looked at the first.

54
00:03:53,486 --> 00:03:57,159
Scott: you can see who digged it in what order who dug it in what order and all that.

55
00:03:57,841 --> 00:04:04,180
Scott: And he noticed that like the first 17 digs on both of these stories now 17 digs isn't enough to get into the front page.

56
00:04:04,884 --> 00:04:18,024
Scott: But if a story has it's sort of like this momentum stories have like their stories either stay at like single digit digs or Some stories like make it to like 10 or 11.

57
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,440
Rym: The more dig something has the more likely it is to get done.

58
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,958
Scott: Yeah, basically just it's like people vote for someone who's gonna win.

59
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:28,640
Scott: Yeah Yeah, it has all the same problems that the United States democracy has.

60
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:46,899
Scott: But so when a story gets like 17 digs It's very likely to just keep getting digs and digs and digs and digs and then become on the front page The first 17 digs on both of these stories submitted by the same guy 16 of the people Were than the first 17 digs of both stories in the same order.

61
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:52,018
Scott: One of those guys is the head dig dude who dug it?

62
00:04:54,624 --> 00:04:56,258
Scott: Yeah, so that's enough to make everyone go.

63
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,780
Rym: Now that itself isn't really the story.

64
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,084
Scott: No It's not so the story.

65
00:05:01,184 --> 00:05:07,669
Rym: similar things happen on slash dot where it's obvious that the moderators do a little bit But I'll roll in big pain.

66
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:10,180
Scott: All right, so here's the story.

67
00:05:11,022 --> 00:05:16,680
Scott: The guy wrote a blog post and his blog about the first 17 digs on both of these posts being the same.

68
00:05:17,824 --> 00:05:30,980
Scott: someone else Submitted that story to ding and then it you know got kicked off It got buried after it got a bunch of digs and then that guy's site his blog got banned from digs.

69
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,972
Scott: So if anyone tried to submit a story from his site, it wouldn't work.

70
00:05:34,514 --> 00:05:35,880
Rym: now enter the bloggers fear.

71
00:05:37,164 --> 00:05:55,602
Scott: So a guy immediately writes a thing in his blog about it and tries to dig it and they try to dig this guy's story and then another guy Writes a blog entry links to the one that's banned and tries to dig that and then at the end of the day there was like a recap story on someone's blog and that got dug and it just Exploded.

72
00:05:56,063 --> 00:05:59,975
Rym: and then as it became apparent that the people in charge of dig were for whatever reason.

73
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:06,202
Rym: well for very obvious reasons Blocking this it hit every other side in the world most notably slash Don's on.

74
00:06:06,322 --> 00:06:07,908
Scott: slash don't come going boring.

75
00:06:07,948 --> 00:06:11,860
Rym: slash dot is the main competitor today goes on everywhere Everywhere.

76
00:06:12,961 --> 00:06:20,499
Rym: It's obvious that the dig editors have some sort of evil way of manipulating things just like the slash dot editors Technically have unlimited mod points.

77
00:06:20,994 --> 00:06:29,419
Scott: Yeah It just shows that dig isn't really a hundred percent pure Democracy as it tries to pretend to be now wouldn't be a problem if they said that it wasn't.

78
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:33,320
Scott: you know The problem is the way they put it off like on the dig website.

79
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,447
Scott: It says dig is unlike other sites.

80
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:38,979
Scott: the users choose the content not the editors.

81
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:47,766
Rym: Well It seems that you know the editors really are sort of indirectly to not only that but I mean it's fine to do those shady Kinds of things but they were caught.

82
00:06:48,087 --> 00:06:58,280
Rym: they were very obviously caught by someone who can verify the fact they were caught and The fact that their immediate response is to do everything in their power to hide this information is laughable.

83
00:06:59,165 --> 00:07:01,560
Rym: Like I've lost significant respect for the people who run dig.

84
00:07:02,342 --> 00:07:07,397
Scott: I'm sure we'll hear I'm gonna hear them be interviewed about this on some podcast this week for sure.

85
00:07:07,417 --> 00:07:15,807
Rym: if they'll even talk Maybe they'll just get all freaky now because every time there was criticism about dig before the guy always talked What could they say other than yeah, we were stupid.

86
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,875
Scott: I don't know but we're gonna find out.

87
00:07:18,135 --> 00:07:19,340
Rym: there's really nothing they can say.

88
00:07:19,582 --> 00:07:20,374
Scott: We'll see what they say.

89
00:07:20,962 --> 00:07:22,980
Scott: They probably say something like we didn't do anything.

90
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,937
Scott: It was reported a whole bunch of times and if a site gets reported a bunch of times then we block it.

91
00:07:27,037 --> 00:07:29,379
Rym: Yeah, whatever We'll see.

92
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:31,806
Scott: But it yeah, it seems like.

93
00:07:31,846 --> 00:07:36,400
Scott: because what you can do on dig is you can see you can watch what one person is digging.

94
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:48,677
Scott: So if you're really popular and a lot of people look at what you dig then if you dig something once Then that's like you can vote with a whole bunch of digs because all the people watching you and caring about what you dig will Dig it also.

95
00:07:49,362 --> 00:07:58,276
Scott: So that's sort of what happens is the editors are so popular on their own site that when they dig something it gets a hajillion Digs kind of like when John Carmack post something on slashdot.

96
00:07:58,296 --> 00:07:59,080
Scott: He gets plus five.

97
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:03,440
Rym: You know, yep, of course his plus fives are always fully legitimate.

98
00:08:03,902 --> 00:08:08,440
Scott: Well, cuz he he doesn't seem to post on slash that unless he has something to say and it's usually about his own stuff.

99
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,497
Rym: So yeah, of course, he's not quite the expert on the gaming industry that summer Gupta is.

100
00:08:13,517 --> 00:08:19,071
Rym: no We still haven't done our whole show on summer Gupta.

101
00:08:19,252 --> 00:08:21,060
Scott: we could make this show the show on summer Gupta.

102
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:27,553
Rym: Let's not do that because I don't have all the research handy I want to go through like the Usenet post from the 80s from summer Gupta.

103
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:29,579
Rym: All right, he's been around for a long time.

104
00:08:31,161 --> 00:08:38,799
Rym: Well, cuz he worked for you know, Nintendo and Sega and Sony and Microsoft and Nokia and God Jesus Buddha.

105
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:44,273
Rym: I believe he worked for IBM in the United States military at one point Wow.

106
00:08:44,554 --> 00:08:49,166
Rym: He was a scientist at Oxford Yale Cambridge 300 years old.

107
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:51,899
Scott: or did he work at each of those companies for one minute until they fired him?

108
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,872
Rym: Obviously, he's some sort of immortal possibly a vampire.

109
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,287
Scott: Oh I'll have to get my holy waters.

110
00:08:58,588 --> 00:08:59,753
Rym: Yeah, watch out.

111
00:08:59,793 --> 00:09:00,114
Rym: Eventually.

112
00:09:00,134 --> 00:09:01,560
Rym: He's gonna have to go back to Dracula's castle.

113
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,122
Rym: I'll get some blood.

114
00:09:02,423 --> 00:09:04,512
Scott: maybe maybe not who knows anyway.

115
00:09:04,552 --> 00:09:23,780
Rym: Yeah anyway, so in other news I don't know if many of you are aware of palladium books, but they are the people who put out rifts and rift world and Basically, if you ever go into a gaming store, you know, there's the D&D section Maybe the board game section all the different sections and there's always that wall or that giant shelf full of a million rifts books.

116
00:09:24,742 --> 00:09:26,753
Scott: Well, you know, there's all kinds of different RPGs.

117
00:09:26,773 --> 00:09:28,080
Scott: there's like gurps and whatnot.

118
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,620
Scott: But yeah rifts is like the the I don't know bastard stepchild or something.

119
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,940
Rym: Well there I mean they're so big like there's always a giant section at any reasonable gaming store.

120
00:09:39,402 --> 00:09:43,820
Rym: And the thing is I'd never actually seen anyone so much as touch one of those books.

121
00:09:44,241 --> 00:09:52,200
Scott: I was slightly interested in playing them at some point because I there's always cool robots on the cover and they look sort and I Think there was even like a rifts robo tech at one point.

122
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:57,902
Rym: I'll say this now because I've known people I've met people who actually have played rifts a little bit and I know a bit I've never actually played it.

123
00:09:58,544 --> 00:10:04,520
Rym: It is probably one of the worst most poorly conceived gaming systems I've ever imagined.

124
00:10:04,909 --> 00:10:05,279
Scott: Oh, really?

125
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:18,800
Rym: The the way it was described actually fairly succinctly by someone else on slashdot When the story I'm about to talk about was posted where he basically said, you know When you were 14 and you rewrote the rules to Dungeons & Dragons and you thought you were some sort of visionary

126
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:20,219
Scott: Gee, who do I know like that?

127
00:10:23,251 --> 00:10:25,523
Rym: Well That's what rifts is.

128
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:28,231
Rym: rifts is horribly complex.

129
00:10:28,532 --> 00:10:30,377
Rym: The rules are not terribly self-consistent.

130
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:31,300
Rym: There's a million books.

131
00:10:31,341 --> 00:10:32,759
Rym: I could go on and on about the system.

132
00:10:32,921 --> 00:10:35,220
Scott: So I didn't even think the company that made wrists is still around.

133
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,109
Scott: I thought that they just kept selling old rifts books.

134
00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:42,141
Scott: because see I actually thought the same thing because I never seen a new rifts Book.

135
00:10:42,161 --> 00:10:45,980
Scott: the ones I always see in stores are like these really old ones and there's a whole bunch of them.

136
00:10:46,281 --> 00:10:59,333
Rym: well, apparently not only were they still in business, but they're shortly not going to be in business anymore and The reasons they're not going to be in business are either Farcical lies or hilarious or any combination of those three?

137
00:10:59,353 --> 00:11:01,220
Scott: Yeah, it's hard to tell at this point.

138
00:11:01,421 --> 00:11:05,784
Rym: Now the one thing I do know is that they hadn't been doing so well for a while Despite what people say.

139
00:11:05,805 --> 00:11:17,236
Rym: the people who basically are two types people in the world people who love Palladium games and books and love rifts and thus will they have nothing but good to say about it and people who have never heard Of it and don't care.

140
00:11:18,722 --> 00:11:21,896
Rym: So whenever you read anything about palladium or rifts, it's always.

141
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:22,720
Rym: oh, it's awesome.

142
00:11:23,222 --> 00:11:26,994
Rym: Oh only the awesome elite masters of gaming play rifts.

143
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,680
Rym: Oh, it's such an intricate world.

144
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,350
Scott: Isn't that what anyone thinks about whatever gaming system they play?

145
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,100
Scott: I mean, oh only the elite masters play burning wheel.

146
00:11:34,462 --> 00:11:36,559
Scott: Well, the elite masters play curbs.

147
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:48,006
Rym: So worst thing about rifts is that the system is kind of bad and the people who love it I'll always say things like yeah character creation takes eight hours and it's hellishly complex But that makes it good.

148
00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:49,974
Rym: It forces you to think about your character.

149
00:11:50,014 --> 00:11:54,169
Rym: You have to do research and shit Great and all sorts of God.

150
00:11:54,229 --> 00:11:57,699
Rym: I don't want to get into the system because it's not a show about rifts It's a show about the news.

151
00:11:58,081 --> 00:12:08,367
Rym: So the news is they're basically going bankrupt to the point that the dude the rifts dude is basically begging all of his fans to buy $50 prints that probably aren't worth $50.

152
00:12:08,367 --> 00:12:12,320
Rym: so we can get enough money to pay off some debt and not go out of business.

153
00:12:13,381 --> 00:12:21,860
Rym: Now the main reason they're going out of business aside from the fact that I have never met anyone I like to played rifts for any reasonable span of time.

154
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,051
Scott: I never met anyone I knew played rifts.

155
00:12:24,151 --> 00:12:25,920
Rym: few people at our wag had the books.

156
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,350
Rym: I'm sure they did how our wag owned most of the books.

157
00:12:28,471 --> 00:12:29,073
Scott: They did they.

158
00:12:29,214 --> 00:12:30,740
Rym: I don't know if anyone used him anymore.

159
00:12:30,921 --> 00:12:32,346
Scott: I never seen anyone play it.

160
00:12:32,467 --> 00:12:34,816
Scott: I never knew anyone who was playing it.

161
00:12:36,764 --> 00:12:45,257
Rym: Yeah, you you all out there for Scott's ranch about the comic industry in America And the fact that they only exist in order to sell products to people who are already fans.

162
00:12:45,377 --> 00:12:48,366
Rym: Yep Rifts is a lot like that.

163
00:12:48,627 --> 00:12:49,590
Scott: It's exactly like that.

164
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:52,099
Rym: Yes, and the people who play rifts keep playing rifts.

165
00:12:53,542 --> 00:13:08,720
Rym: well, the other reason that palladium wasn't doing so well and I swear this is not a joke the thing that they invested their money into and that they thought was going to save their company And revolutionize everything give them a pile of money Was a rifts game for the fucking engage.

166
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:15,820
Scott: Yeah They apparently had a deal with Nokia and to make an engage game based on rifts and not not a computer.

167
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:18,678
Scott: Yeah, they expected to get a bunch of royalties for it and stuff.

168
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:19,886
Rym: now I submit that.

169
00:13:19,947 --> 00:13:23,586
Rym: now they say like oh, it's not Nokia's fault They did their best and it's not our fault.

170
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:25,996
Rym: the the system just didn't succeed.

171
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:27,100
Rym: and that sort of thing happens.

172
00:13:27,523 --> 00:13:29,940
Scott: No, you were stupid and you invested in the engage.

173
00:13:30,005 --> 00:13:31,645
Scott: No New is gonna suck.

174
00:13:31,765 --> 00:13:35,900
Rym: no one in the world except Nokia themselves thought that the engage was going to do.

175
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,945
Rym: Well, no one.

176
00:13:37,126 --> 00:13:38,814
Scott: Well, apparently palladium did they.

177
00:13:38,955 --> 00:13:39,417
Rym: yeah, okay.

178
00:13:39,457 --> 00:13:40,040
Rym: There's two people.

179
00:13:40,322 --> 00:13:42,560
Rym: Yeah, I mean you don't know anything about video games.

180
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:50,760
Scott: If you don't know anything about video games to the point where you think the engage is gonna succeed I knew the engage is gonna succeed as it was gonna fail as soon as someone said it existed.

181
00:13:51,102 --> 00:13:55,138
Rym: Yeah, I heard about it and I thought that's probably going to fail Yep.

182
00:13:55,342 --> 00:13:58,084
Rym: and then I saw it and I thought that's Definitely going to fail.

183
00:13:58,445 --> 00:14:03,866
Rym: and then I saw the hype for it and I thought and then I knew that I was right when side Talking came out.

184
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:04,449
Rym: Yep.

185
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:06,220
Rym: That wasn't even the death knell for me.

186
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,620
Rym: The death knell for me was when it actually came out and I didn't actually notice for months.

187
00:14:11,621 --> 00:14:15,637
Rym: Yeah, like I didn't realize like it always I noticed because of side talking I'd heard.

188
00:14:15,698 --> 00:14:16,843
Rym: Oh, it's coming It's coming.

189
00:14:16,884 --> 00:14:17,929
Rym: and I thought oh, it's gonna fail.

190
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:18,533
Rym: It's gonna fail.

191
00:14:19,217 --> 00:14:24,031
Rym: and then one day I saw it failed and I thought what it came out And sure enough it had come out.

192
00:14:24,092 --> 00:14:31,839
Scott: in fact, I remember the side talking I remember the side talking but that's how I remembered when it came out is because I didn't know it came out But I knew I saw people starting to make fun of it.

193
00:14:32,312 --> 00:14:39,780
Rym: But yeah The Palladium Games people invested their money in a game for the engage and when it failed they lost a lot of money.

194
00:14:40,101 --> 00:14:47,895
Scott: Well, you see here's the thing is that that makes a lot of sense and the guy even admits like yeah You know, we tried to make an engage game and it fell through.

195
00:14:47,936 --> 00:14:48,519
Scott: so that didn't go.

196
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:51,353
Rym: well Here's where it gets interesting the guy himself.

197
00:14:52,196 --> 00:14:58,980
Rym: I forget his name It's hard to pronounce but I saw him once at a convention a long long time ago, and I don't know the dude.

198
00:14:59,302 --> 00:15:01,459
Rym: So what I'm about to say is definitely hearsay.

199
00:15:01,761 --> 00:15:05,756
Rym: But I've never met a single person on this earth who has a high opinion of that man.

200
00:15:05,776 --> 00:15:11,320
Rym: Mm-hmm He is about as respected as Steve Bennett is in the anime industry.

201
00:15:12,301 --> 00:15:19,272
Rym: So he's respected by the people who love his stuff and hated by everyone else kind of like that Harlan guy Whoever he is the penny arcade kind of owned a while ago.

202
00:15:19,292 --> 00:15:20,398
Scott: Yeah the sci-fi I think.

203
00:15:20,739 --> 00:15:24,060
Rym: yeah I actually never heard that guy didn't know anything about him until penny arcade made fun of him.

204
00:15:24,241 --> 00:15:27,340
Scott: Yeah, I knew his name and I knew he was a sci-fi writer.

205
00:15:27,421 --> 00:15:30,463
Scott: That's all I knew but I couldn't tell you one single story He wrote.

206
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:36,420
Scott: and then when penny arcade made fun of him I went to check it out and I didn't recognize any of his stories at all.

207
00:15:36,621 --> 00:15:38,151
Rym: Yeah, but a big deal is.

208
00:15:38,211 --> 00:15:39,520
Rym: it was funny like he thought he was famous.

209
00:15:39,641 --> 00:15:42,513
Rym: But now penny arcade has more hits per day than I think.

210
00:15:42,554 --> 00:15:43,940
Rym: if anyone has ever read of his fan.

211
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:48,817
Scott: Penny arcade made a shit podcast and they just finally made a feed and they jumped to number 12 on iTunes.

212
00:15:49,661 --> 00:15:51,549
Rym: Yeah, that's 12 out of all the podcast.

213
00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:57,136
Scott: if Harlan Ellison made a podcast where he read his books I think I think GeekNights would be more popular than that.

214
00:15:57,237 --> 00:16:02,676
Rym: I think so But suffice to say I made a comment on slash dot about this story.

215
00:16:02,716 --> 00:16:03,580
Rym: You can see my comment.

216
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,045
Rym: It's modded minus one flame bait.

217
00:16:05,406 --> 00:16:05,687
Scott: awesome.

218
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:06,369
Rym: Now.

219
00:16:06,811 --> 00:16:09,520
Rym: All I said was I've never seen anyone buy a rifts book.

220
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:10,671
Rym: How are they in business?

221
00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:18,360
Rym: Anyway, this was And the responses I got were from the same kinds of people who are apologists for American comic books.

222
00:16:18,982 --> 00:16:21,549
Rym: They basically said things like like what I just said.

223
00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:26,609
Rym: Oh, well, the system's complicated, but blah blah blah or You don't understand.

224
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,460
Rym: I own all the books and I'm a fan.

225
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:36,520
Rym: So, yeah Palladium books is going out of business and all I have to say about that is it's about fucking time.

226
00:16:36,682 --> 00:16:37,939
Rym: I thought you were out of business.

227
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:42,893
Scott: Yeah, and apparently the guy in charge says that the even does.

228
00:16:42,953 --> 00:16:45,300
Scott: you know that the engage and all that other stuff isn't you know?

229
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,324
Scott: That stuff was bad.

230
00:16:46,344 --> 00:16:52,291
Scott: But the real reason he's bankrupt is because there was some sort of Embezzlement theft thing he can't talk about.

231
00:16:52,351 --> 00:16:54,400
Rym: Yeah, but he says it was like almost a million dollars.

232
00:16:54,561 --> 00:16:56,775
Rym: I couldn't believe that they ever had a million dollars.

233
00:16:56,795 --> 00:16:57,640
Scott: He had a million dollars.

234
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,448
Scott: Why was he still making shitty rifts books?

235
00:16:59,749 --> 00:17:00,793
Rym: He had a million dollars.

236
00:17:00,834 --> 00:17:02,320
Rym: Why wasn't he making better rifts books?

237
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:05,551
Scott: Yeah, hire some real good people who know how to make books.

238
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,579
Rym: Yeah, I just don't.

239
00:17:08,662 --> 00:17:11,560
Rym: If anyone out there is a fan of rifts send us some audio feedback.

240
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,434
Rym: I'm really curious how anyone could like such a terrible system for any reason.

241
00:17:15,555 --> 00:17:20,653
Scott: the only reason I could see Someone liking that is the only reason I could possibly like it is the robots.

242
00:17:20,794 --> 00:17:22,599
Rym: other than that the robots are kind of terrible.

243
00:17:23,145 --> 00:17:24,660
Scott: They look cool on the cover of the books.

244
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,152
Scott: if you want just going by the pictures on the covers of the book.

245
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:31,804
Rym: if you want robots you're better off playing a mech warrior or Possibly Bezum.

246
00:17:32,406 --> 00:17:34,474
Rym: the Bezum has a decent giant robot system.

247
00:17:34,694 --> 00:17:36,240
Scott: Yeah, we should play that sometime.

248
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:41,977
Scott: We can play the d20 Bezum, we should play a Bezum super sentai whatever combining robot team.

249
00:17:42,138 --> 00:17:43,678
Scott: Ooh Yeah, that'd be fun.

250
00:17:50,584 --> 00:17:59,158
Rym: So things of the day now as since I work for IBM I work with a lot of Indians and many of them lived in India grew up in India not Native Americans.

251
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:02,888
Scott: Indians Yes Indians from India Now like a poof.

252
00:18:03,512 --> 00:18:03,714
Rym: Yeah.

253
00:18:03,935 --> 00:18:04,237
Scott: Thank you.

254
00:18:04,258 --> 00:18:04,600
Scott: Come again.

255
00:18:06,621 --> 00:18:11,680
Rym: Now the one thing that they've all pretty much unanimously said, I mean they generally like India and they're very they like America.

256
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,403
Rym: They like India too.

257
00:18:12,483 --> 00:18:29,460
Rym: No, it's not like they're apologetic or anything about anything of either of the countries but every one of them has unabashedly expressed that driving in India is crazy Like there are no lights or rules and everything just kind of goes.

258
00:18:29,921 --> 00:18:37,160
Scott: It seemed to be like a lot of countries other than like, you know real westernized countries like, you know.

259
00:18:37,461 --> 00:18:39,539
Rym: Yeah, like like, you know, mister like, you know.

260
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:52,019
Scott: It seems to me like all the non westernized countries of the non heavily westernized countries Also do not have strict traffic like well central South America mix pretty much Mexico down doesn't have strict traffic.

261
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:57,620
Scott: and You know east of Germany, I guess I'm not really sure about that.

262
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,735
Rym: But Russia actually has fairly evolved traffic.

263
00:19:00,775 --> 00:19:01,740
Scott: Russia has pretty evolved.

264
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,875
Rym: The only difference is the fact that there's a lot of open land in Russia.

265
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:08,051
Scott: Yeah, China I don't think has I think near the cities.

266
00:19:08,091 --> 00:19:10,623
Scott: The traffic is pretty good, but elsewhere I don't know.

267
00:19:10,864 --> 00:19:21,039
Rym: All I know is there's now a video on the internet of a typical intersection in India and All I have to say is that if you saw a similar scene in America hundreds would be dead.

268
00:19:21,723 --> 00:19:23,478
Scott: Well, it's just because people in America can't deal with it.

269
00:19:24,025 --> 00:19:33,196
Rym: but it's it's like Americans are so used to their perfectly regimented traffic system that if anything goes wrong if anything is out of the ordinary There's immediately an accident and a clusterfuck.

270
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:45,379
Rym: Yep I mean just today there was like a tiny little fire on the side of the road like off the road in the grass Mm-hmm, both Scott and I were backed up for like 20 minutes half-hour cuz just gawkers little rubbernecking.

271
00:19:45,499 --> 00:19:50,560
Rym: Yeah But like if a traffic, I mean there's a big power outage in New York a few years ago like power.

272
00:19:51,102 --> 00:19:55,800
Rym: You all know this power went out and basically Northeast America for many days or these us?

273
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:59,210
Scott: Yeah, Northeast America includes like Nova Scotia and shit.

274
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,895
Rym: Yeah, but parts of Canada went down too.

275
00:20:01,015 --> 00:20:14,454
Rym: Yeah, okay fine and Actually was funny because I remember I called Scott on my cell phone from work because my cell phone still worked Yep, and I said the power is out I'm going home and he said the power is out here too and he was in Connecticut.

276
00:20:14,955 --> 00:20:15,236
Rym: Mm-hmm.

277
00:20:15,276 --> 00:20:20,060
Rym: And then I thought oh, I Also thought oh, I have all the whole bunch of stories about the power outage.

278
00:20:20,181 --> 00:20:21,898
Rym: I was actually out directing traffic during it.

279
00:20:22,603 --> 00:20:30,060
Rym: the thing is it took me over an hour to drive home because People couldn't deal with the fact that there were no traffic lights, even though there wasn't that much traffic.

280
00:20:31,141 --> 00:20:37,240
Rym: It's just that people don't seem to remember that if the traffic light doesn't work every intersection is a four-way stop.

281
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:38,587
Rym: Yep, that's it.

282
00:20:38,868 --> 00:20:39,150
Rym: That's it.

283
00:20:39,411 --> 00:20:40,456
Rym: What's so hard about that?

284
00:20:40,517 --> 00:20:41,140
Scott: Of course in India?

285
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:41,977
Scott: It's a four-way go.

286
00:20:42,682 --> 00:20:55,240
Rym: the thing is everyone's going constantly and people just kind of maneuver around each other and no one got hit despite the fact that Literally, I couldn't imagine anyone doing anything anything like that in America without just death.

287
00:20:55,782 --> 00:20:59,079
Scott: Well, I think what it is is in America is because the system is so regimented.

288
00:20:59,581 --> 00:21:04,300
Scott: You just kind of put it into reflex memory in your brain and you don't have to think about it.

289
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,767
Scott: You don't have to consciously drive.

290
00:21:05,787 --> 00:21:08,600
Scott: you just sit behind the wheel and you become this machine of driving.

291
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:10,208
Rym: Yep, which I think is very good things.

292
00:21:10,872 --> 00:21:12,440
Scott: It does have its advantages and disadvantages.

293
00:21:12,681 --> 00:21:20,854
Rym: It's a good thing that that's possible because on long trips or if you're driving long distances It's very good to be able to take some of your attention away from the road.

294
00:21:21,497 --> 00:21:22,360
Scott: That is also true.

295
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:26,400
Scott: Is that in America you're gonna take a lot of long trips somewhere like Europe not so much.

296
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,300
Scott: You're gonna take a train for a long trip and most of your driving is busy city driving, which should be conscious.

297
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,920
Rym: Yeah to me the problem isn't that the our road system is set up to where it can be done semi-subconsciously.

298
00:21:36,882 --> 00:21:40,619
Rym: The problem is that many people don't know how to drive actively and consciously at all.

299
00:21:41,061 --> 00:21:44,411
Scott: Yeah, it's like when the system is, you know broken.

300
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:47,300
Scott: somehow people can't return to conscious driving.

301
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,360
Scott: They don't have the skills of conscious and reflex driving.

302
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:54,600
Rym: They only have reflex driving like if there's a car parked block kind of blocking the lane of traffic.

303
00:21:55,801 --> 00:22:00,559
Rym: Most people don't seem to realize that you just can kind of edge over in your lane a little bit and get around it.

304
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,484
Rym: Yep, instead.

305
00:22:01,524 --> 00:22:04,879
Rym: They'll give it like a 10-foot berth and cause a huge giant mess.

306
00:22:05,301 --> 00:22:18,517
Scott: Mm-hmm, but it seems like in India and other countries where traffic isn't so strict and military precision That people seem to drive consciously and you know, they look out and they avoid each other.

307
00:22:18,577 --> 00:22:23,660
Scott: and you know There's some countries where people is bumping into each other all over the place and just go hey you bumped into me.

308
00:22:25,281 --> 00:22:28,531
Scott: You know, it's just a different thing and it works differently.

309
00:22:28,551 --> 00:22:30,397
Scott: That's not better or worse a wager.

310
00:22:30,437 --> 00:22:31,400
Rym: It's a lot less efficient.

311
00:22:31,561 --> 00:22:37,100
Rym: I mean, there are a lot more cars in America and long trips and cars are really our only major means of transportation.

312
00:22:37,381 --> 00:22:38,686
Rym: Yeah, I mean we're lucky.

313
00:22:38,706 --> 00:22:42,060
Rym: we live down by New York City where there's trains and buses and all sorts of fun things.

314
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:47,119
Rym: But I mean when I grew up in Michigan, I'd never seen a train that wasn't at an amusement park.

315
00:22:47,521 --> 00:22:52,998
Rym: Yeah, I saw a freight train like once in Ohio and there were no trains.

316
00:22:53,078 --> 00:22:53,600
Rym: We had trains.

317
00:22:55,366 --> 00:23:01,540
Scott: Oh So, um, I got a thing of the day that's actually kind of old.

318
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:07,280
Scott: It's like from a week or so ago, but I wasn't here and then other better things of the day came along.

319
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,324
Rym: You're doing a Thundercats thing.

320
00:23:08,605 --> 00:23:10,071
Rym: Yeah, I can't believe you're doing that.

321
00:23:10,272 --> 00:23:10,674
Scott: Why not?

322
00:23:10,855 --> 00:23:12,160
Rym: Cuz it feels old to me.

323
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,144
Rym: We've watched it already.

324
00:23:13,344 --> 00:23:14,248
Scott: I know isn't it?

325
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,797
Scott: But there's some people who might not have seen it.

326
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:21,638
Scott: So Thundercats possibly thunder Thundercats.

327
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:26,965
Scott: Oh Possibly one of the best 80s kids shows.

328
00:23:27,146 --> 00:23:28,854
Rym: give him grant me sight beyond sight.

329
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:29,999
Scott: Yeah, that's a great way.

330
00:23:31,602 --> 00:23:38,380
Scott: There are so many things I could say about Thundercats like if I do a Thundercats show But we will do a Thundercats show great once we get the DVDs.

331
00:23:38,942 --> 00:23:41,792
Scott: Yes season two of DVDs just came out actually.

332
00:23:41,812 --> 00:23:43,377
Rym: Yeah season one is in my Netflix queue.

333
00:23:43,417 --> 00:23:44,684
Scott: Well at season two It just came out.

334
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:45,733
Rym: I will awesome.

335
00:23:45,753 --> 00:23:48,539
Scott: So Some guys got together.

336
00:23:48,841 --> 00:23:54,440
Scott: Remember that live-action Zelda movie kind of thingy that was a few minutes long those guys put together.

337
00:23:54,722 --> 00:23:56,578
Rym: Yeah, I don't know if we made it a thing of the day or not.

338
00:23:57,384 --> 00:23:59,139
Rym: Anyway, link is real doofy in it.

339
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:05,800
Scott: Yeah, so some guys got up and they they got really good Thundercats costumes like really good.

340
00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:12,960
Scott: You know Lionel has these leather hot pants, but other than that, yeah, like Lionel's hair is cost like professional cosplayer done.

341
00:24:13,141 --> 00:24:19,059
Scott: Yeah, these people look like super anime cosplayers doing Thundercats the mum ross a little weak, but whatever.

342
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:30,260
Scott: and They do this cool Trailery thing that looks like it could be a trailer for a real live-action Thundercats movie and it's really well done and pretty awesome.

343
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,653
Rym: Yep, I mean the CG is a little weak.

344
00:24:31,693 --> 00:24:32,299
Rym: But what do you expect?

345
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,536
Scott: Yeah, the CG is equal in quality to the one for that fan-made Star Wars movie.

346
00:24:37,556 --> 00:24:39,807
Scott: that actually was a whole movie You can go watch on the internet.

347
00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:40,170
Rym: Yep.

348
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:40,814
Rym: I've heard it's good.

349
00:24:40,834 --> 00:24:41,700
Rym: I haven't actually watched it.

350
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:45,132
Scott: I watched part of it and the problem I had is it looked.

351
00:24:45,433 --> 00:24:50,165
Scott: it's probably acting was real nerdy acting Better than episode 1 Possibly.

352
00:24:50,185 --> 00:24:55,751
Scott: Yeah, it all definitely but the acting was really nerdy Like I'm in a role-playing game kind of acting.

353
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:57,559
Scott: Oh and that kind of bothers me.

354
00:24:58,182 --> 00:25:00,595
Scott: But other than that, it seemed great like fear of girls.

355
00:25:00,977 --> 00:25:01,620
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

356
00:25:02,186 --> 00:25:05,126
Scott: but Yeah, this Thundercats thing.

357
00:25:05,147 --> 00:25:06,874
Scott: The only thing I can say bad about it.

358
00:25:07,377 --> 00:25:10,973
Scott: Is that Some of the fight choreography is a little bit weak.

359
00:25:11,395 --> 00:25:12,540
Rym: They picked the worst song.

360
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,568
Scott: They picked the worst song.

361
00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:14,960
Scott: they picked the Sephiroth song.

362
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:21,995
Scott: You know the song where they scream Sephiroth Sephiroth in the background Yeah, which would be an okay song if there wasn't people constantly going.

363
00:25:22,276 --> 00:25:22,999
Scott: Sephiroth.

364
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:26,092
Scott: Yeah, cuz now Sephiroth isn't here.

365
00:25:26,513 --> 00:25:28,040
Scott: You should have picked the song with no words.

366
00:25:28,261 --> 00:25:36,931
Rym: In fact, he's dead though, or maybe you should have like remixed the Thundercats theme like Or just use the extended version of it.

367
00:25:37,373 --> 00:25:38,719
Scott: Yeah, there you go or something.

368
00:25:39,942 --> 00:25:43,697
Rym: Pick some generic Latin chanting song that doesn't say Sephiroth over and over.

369
00:25:44,018 --> 00:25:46,939
Scott: Yeah At least change it to like "lion, no".

370
00:25:49,008 --> 00:25:54,926
Scott: "Tetsuo, Tetsuo" "Mumraa" "The ever-living" Ancient spirits of evil.

371
00:25:54,946 --> 00:25:56,431
Scott: Yeah, we get the idea.

372
00:25:56,732 --> 00:25:57,655
Rym: We could do a whole show on Thundercats.

373
00:25:57,675 --> 00:25:58,699
Scott: "Sword of Omens".

374
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:03,060
Scott: So anyway, let us get beyond this part of the podcast.

375
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:07,314
Rym: So we'll move on to the bit the main Thursday bit.

376
00:26:07,996 --> 00:26:09,100
Scott: What are we gonna do today?

377
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,675
Rym: Well, we weren't sure until a little while ago and it's not a cop-out.

378
00:26:12,715 --> 00:26:13,660
Rym: You mean a few minutes ago?

379
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:14,987
Rym: Yeah, it's not a cop-out.

380
00:26:15,027 --> 00:26:15,932
Rym: I mean we cop out.

381
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:20,246
Rym: It's basically a tech news roundup Or a we rant about politics.

382
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:26,186
Rym: But no, we decided because we're both kind of Doing this currently.

383
00:26:26,266 --> 00:26:31,064
Rym: It's how to look for, find, and secure a job Not a job.

384
00:26:31,145 --> 00:26:33,475
Scott: Well, we can actually cover all kinds of jobs.

385
00:26:33,736 --> 00:26:34,399
Rym: Yeah, we'll just do it.

386
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,126
Scott: Oh, these jobs that we know how to acquire.

387
00:26:36,186 --> 00:26:41,831
Scott: Don't ask me how to get a job doing like crazy stuff Like working for Blackwater.

388
00:26:42,053 --> 00:26:43,120
Scott: Yeah, I don't know how to get that job.

389
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,040
Rym: I don't know what you need on your resume to work for Blackwater.

390
00:26:45,341 --> 00:26:46,950
Scott: I can tell you how to get a computer job.

391
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:50,504
Scott: I can tell you how to get a minimum wage Manual labor job.

392
00:26:50,524 --> 00:26:54,740
Scott: I can tell you how to get a job at a college to do while you're at school.

393
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,840
Scott: Yep, I can tell you how to get any kind of job I've gotten.

394
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:05,063
Rym: Yeah, though We got to kind of mitigate our our advice because I know a lot of people have had trouble finding jobs But we really haven't.

395
00:27:05,746 --> 00:27:07,573
Scott: Maybe that's because we have a lot of skills.

396
00:27:07,974 --> 00:27:08,597
Rym: Yeah, I don't know.

397
00:27:08,637 --> 00:27:12,006
Rym: I mean I've never Really been want for having a job.

398
00:27:12,347 --> 00:27:16,820
Scott: People are still sending me job offers, and I haven't been on the job market in months.

399
00:27:17,422 --> 00:27:19,812
Rym: I still get job offers to my RIT email account.

400
00:27:19,832 --> 00:27:21,600
Scott: A year later people are sending me job offers.

401
00:27:22,681 --> 00:27:23,443
Rym: Yeah, so anyway.

402
00:27:23,704 --> 00:27:25,189
Rym: I'll say it now to get it out of the way.

403
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:26,373
Rym: Get a job.

404
00:27:26,754 --> 00:27:27,697
Scott: Yes, get a job.

405
00:27:27,737 --> 00:27:28,440
Rym: Get a job.

406
00:27:29,943 --> 00:27:30,048
Rym: Azuzu.

407
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,088
Scott: Okay, you haven't been to Pirate Universe.

408
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:36,663
Rym: All right, so I guess we could give a little bit of background on the jobs We've had.

409
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:37,408
Rym: Okay.

410
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,480
Rym: All right, my first job ever.

411
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:46,946
Rym: I actually never had a legitimate paid taxes on it job until after I graduated high school Mm-hmm at that point.

412
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:50,217
Rym: I got a job for the United States federal government working on the 2000 census.

413
00:27:51,846 --> 00:28:00,420
Rym: I actually have a whole bunch of cool Memorabilia that I didn't swipe because when the census goes it goes it finishes it shuts down and you can just everyone takes everything.

414
00:28:01,563 --> 00:28:03,534
Rym: So I have all these highlighters and pens and balloons.

415
00:28:03,555 --> 00:28:04,962
Rym: they census 2000.

416
00:28:04,962 --> 00:28:07,712
Rym: It was actually a really fun job and for being in high school.

417
00:28:07,772 --> 00:28:10,000
Rym: It paid 11 bucks an hour, which was like crazy.

418
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:15,240
Scott: My grandma worked for the census a long time ago, and it goes every 10 years.

419
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:19,375
Scott: Yeah, she did it in like the in the World Trade Center and everything is a little.

420
00:28:19,636 --> 00:28:23,040
Rym: but while it was still there Yeah, it was actually a really fun job.

421
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,115
Rym: I was an HR clerk, so I did like payroll stuff and I hired and fired and all sorts of fun things.

422
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,795
Rym: I Worked with mostly older housewives who were bored.

423
00:28:31,815 --> 00:28:37,240
Rym: Yeah Yeah, and I was probably the youngest person anywhere in that frickin facility.

424
00:28:38,062 --> 00:28:39,897
Scott: Maybe when there's another census we can go work for.

425
00:28:40,038 --> 00:28:41,002
Rym: actually I was.

426
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:46,020
Rym: I got a letter of recommendation from the guy Elmer Maui who I. he was really old.

427
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:46,850
Rym: I wonder if he's still alive.

428
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:47,639
Rym: It's been a long time.

429
00:28:48,042 --> 00:28:55,639
Rym: He was a cool dude though, and he basically told me yeah If you want to do the census in 2010 you can be like a regional manager or whatnot guy.

430
00:28:56,504 --> 00:28:59,804
Scott: Oh, then you can hire me to be the Regional computer.

431
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:00,788
Scott: whatnot guy thing is.

432
00:29:00,868 --> 00:29:03,340
Rym: I don't think the census would pay more than I make currently.

433
00:29:03,682 --> 00:29:06,420
Scott: Well, no, can't you do the census and your normal job at the same time?

434
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,347
Rym: No, the census was a 40-hour a week job.

435
00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:09,913
Rym: Oh, well now you could.

436
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:14,250
Rym: you can do like the door-to-door census Which is like 10 hours a week and weekends and fun stuff.

437
00:29:14,531 --> 00:29:17,221
Rym: Yeah, but no I did the full-on job job part Uh-huh.

438
00:29:17,402 --> 00:29:21,174
Scott: Well, so all those people must be normally unemployed people at the census.

439
00:29:21,535 --> 00:29:23,080
Rym: either that or they're people who?

440
00:29:24,021 --> 00:29:28,204
Rym: You know, they're a housewife or a house husband or something like that Or they're in school.

441
00:29:28,285 --> 00:29:29,068
Rym: It's summer vacation.

442
00:29:29,369 --> 00:29:30,514
Scott: Yeah, that makes sense.

443
00:29:30,695 --> 00:29:31,940
Rym: I mean it was before I went to college.

444
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,533
Rym: it was my first job ever and I never applied for a job before.

445
00:29:35,593 --> 00:29:36,697
Rym: like I had no idea what to do.

446
00:29:36,717 --> 00:29:44,836
Rym: and I'll say this government jobs and jobs for big corporations like big corporations are very different from.

447
00:29:44,856 --> 00:29:54,160
Rym: I don't want to say real jobs But I guess more intimate jobs or more skilled jobs in that they'll often have a very standardized way of hiring you.

448
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:58,309
Rym: They'll make you take a test or something Mm-hmm, and I had to take a test.

449
00:29:58,349 --> 00:30:00,237
Rym: It was probably the most inane test I've ever taken.

450
00:30:00,277 --> 00:30:00,699
Rym: It was 40 questions.

451
00:30:01,021 --> 00:30:01,707
Rym: I got a perfect score.

452
00:30:01,727 --> 00:30:02,494
Rym: I finished in 10 minutes.

453
00:30:02,514 --> 00:30:02,938
Rym: I turned it in.

454
00:30:04,341 --> 00:30:15,433
Rym: They called me the next day because I got the highest score out of anyone who had taken the test pretty much in the last month and There were people who failed the test meaning they got less than half the questions, right?

455
00:30:15,674 --> 00:30:16,055
Rym: Wow.

456
00:30:16,116 --> 00:30:17,140
Scott: What was the word the question?

457
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,525
Rym: They were like basic math.

458
00:30:18,565 --> 00:30:22,480
Rym: like Susie has 10 apples and she eats six of them and then loses one more.

459
00:30:22,561 --> 00:30:23,579
Rym: How many does she have left?

460
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:27,632
Rym: Three or they were like a train is going 60 miles an hour.

461
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:29,098
Rym: How long does it take to go 70 miles?

462
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,563
Scott: An hour and a bit.

463
00:30:32,185 --> 00:30:32,706
Rym: Yeah.

464
00:30:32,767 --> 00:30:35,234
Rym: Yeah, it was multiple choice and you had an hour.

465
00:30:35,254 --> 00:30:36,438
Scott: Oh my god.

466
00:30:36,498 --> 00:30:36,900
Scott: All right.

467
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:42,680
Rym: Yeah, so the it was partly people who were bored and partly the dregs of society.

468
00:30:42,981 --> 00:30:45,009
Rym: Half the people who got hired went to the trainings.

469
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:48,463
Rym: you got paid the 11 bucks an hour for the training and then they'd never Show up again.

470
00:30:48,484 --> 00:30:50,394
Rym: Yeah, and they'd collect their money.

471
00:30:50,434 --> 00:30:52,086
Rym: Just never come back Huh?

472
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:55,967
Scott: Yeah, I Figured you would actually do the job.

473
00:30:56,027 --> 00:30:57,434
Scott: The job is probably better than the training.

474
00:30:57,535 --> 00:30:58,520
Rym: Yeah, I guess they're stupid.

475
00:30:58,621 --> 00:30:59,387
Rym: The job was fun.

476
00:30:59,407 --> 00:31:03,047
Scott: All right, so Is that the only job you had?

477
00:31:03,811 --> 00:31:04,636
Rym: I had a whole bunch of jobs.

478
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,962
Rym: I guess you can do one All right.

479
00:31:06,002 --> 00:31:07,928
Scott: So my first job.

480
00:31:08,109 --> 00:31:16,371
Scott: Well, the first real job was working at a dry cleaner doing boring manual labor after after school a few days a week.

481
00:31:16,812 --> 00:31:21,963
Scott: Wow, and I got enough money there to buy a computer and That was cool.

482
00:31:22,305 --> 00:31:26,987
Rym: Yeah, I pretty much made in a few weeks over the summer before I went to RIT the money I needed to buy my computer.

483
00:31:27,591 --> 00:31:28,135
Scott: Yeah, let's see.

484
00:31:28,175 --> 00:31:28,960
Scott: How did I get the job?

485
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:29,643
Scott: I went into the.

486
00:31:30,025 --> 00:31:37,640
Scott: I went around town to all the like any place that had a Wanted, you know sign and I went around the mall to different places and it's filled out application forms.

487
00:31:37,905 --> 00:31:50,660
Rym: Yeah, that's the one thing I remember that when I was looking for like temporary or non-skilled or I'm a punk kid jobs You could just like look in the newspapers or go to places When you're looking for a not a career but like a part-time job.

488
00:31:51,423 --> 00:31:56,987
Scott: All you do is go to somewhere and fill out an application and then if they're interested they call you Yeah, even a career.

489
00:31:57,127 --> 00:32:02,720
Rym: often if it's not a technical career You'll just find like an ad in a newspaper sign up and then you'll get a career.

490
00:32:02,949 --> 00:32:03,179
Scott: Yeah.

491
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:12,553
Scott: so I went around signing up and the dry cleaner called me back and I went there and I basically Made sure that shirts didn't get lost in the laundry for a year or so.

492
00:32:12,753 --> 00:32:14,738
Scott: Wow and kind of money.

493
00:32:14,778 --> 00:32:15,200
Rym: Did you make?

494
00:32:16,002 --> 00:32:24,307
Scott: Pretty good money minimum wage plus a bit which when you're in high school and you have no expenses at all Yeah, it comes out to plenty.

495
00:32:24,468 --> 00:32:28,662
Rym: Yeah, the saddest thing in the world is I made like 11 bucks an hour doing the census in 2000.

496
00:32:28,662 --> 00:32:33,719
Rym: I Never made more money than that again until I got hired by IBM.

497
00:32:34,321 --> 00:32:40,340
Rym: Yeah, I made like seven bucks an hour at RIT and then I made like eight when I became an awesome employee.

498
00:32:41,228 --> 00:32:50,779
Scott: I also worked like two or three places as a three different camps at different times as a camp counselor in different situations.

499
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:55,934
Scott: and The thing about a camp counselor job is it's real easy to get one.

500
00:32:56,336 --> 00:32:58,483
Scott: But if you don't do a good job They don't want you back.

501
00:32:59,065 --> 00:32:59,627
Rym: Ah, that's good.

502
00:32:59,847 --> 00:33:03,700
Scott: Yeah, it's just if you're the first time they'll always let you in pretty much.

503
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:10,098
Scott: They'll stick you in like, you know Either with a good counselor or in a bunk that no one cares about or something like that.

504
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:16,237
Scott: But Camp counseling is a lot of fun because basically you're paid to play sports with kids.

505
00:33:16,739 --> 00:33:25,263
Rym: Yep Now I had a whole bunch of non real jobs like while I was in high school like I used to tutor kids in the trumpet and I charged an obscene amount of money like 15 bucks a half hour.

506
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:31,299
Rym: Yeah, and I had a small number of clients that made me quite a bit of money for very little work.

507
00:33:32,163 --> 00:33:44,175
Rym: basically Turing young kids in an instrument boils down to telling them to practice and that's really all you can do and then listening to them And telling them either good job now practice this instead or you obviously didn't practice.

508
00:33:44,195 --> 00:33:45,760
Rym: No, that was it?

509
00:33:46,701 --> 00:33:48,247
Scott: No, and then can't counseling though.

510
00:33:48,267 --> 00:33:55,538
Scott: The trick with that is because if it's a sleep-wake camp Especially they let you live there and they feed you and you get all this stuff that you know.

511
00:33:55,658 --> 00:34:02,570
Scott: kids Usually have to pay thousands of dollars to go to the camp and you're getting it for Basically, you're getting paid to do what they pay for.

512
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:05,280
Scott: that is you don't really get paid minimum wage.

513
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:13,716
Scott: It's they usually give you like one giant paycheck at the end of your time there or a paycheck Halfway through and another one at the end and it doesn't come out to minimum wage.

514
00:34:13,797 --> 00:34:15,704
Scott: because yeah Well, if it's sleep-wake can't?

515
00:34:15,724 --> 00:34:18,713
Scott: that's 24 hours times minimum wage equals.

516
00:34:18,753 --> 00:34:25,951
Scott: I'm rich and the camp goes out of business and Since you're you're not really an hourly worker.

517
00:34:26,011 --> 00:34:27,716
Scott: They don't have to pay you minimum wage.

518
00:34:27,735 --> 00:34:28,318
Scott: There's laws.

519
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,245
Rym: Yeah I remember like a waitress.

520
00:34:30,284 --> 00:34:32,735
Scott: they don't have to pay a waitress because they get tips and whatnot.

521
00:34:32,915 --> 00:34:34,241
Rym: the band camp from my high school.

522
00:34:34,261 --> 00:34:40,049
Rym: they always wanted me to come back and be a counselor and instructor there and I think they paid like $14 a day and I was like, all right now.

523
00:34:40,471 --> 00:34:47,179
Scott: Yeah, I'll make more work in construction somewhere You know it and if you want your summer whatever to be fun, it's a good job.

524
00:34:47,744 --> 00:34:49,800
Scott: But if you want to make a lot of money, it's not a good job.

525
00:34:50,561 --> 00:34:55,100
Scott: You know, you'll make more money working all day at some boring job, but it's fun.

526
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:59,753
Scott: So it you know it evens out Yeah and at the end you just had this pile of money and you didn't.

527
00:34:59,893 --> 00:35:04,413
Scott: you don't have any living expenses because You're just out of a summer camp so you just have like a you.

528
00:35:04,433 --> 00:35:06,080
Scott: basically at the end you have a fistful of dollars.

529
00:35:07,181 --> 00:35:18,800
Rym: Now I remember we got to RIT and we had to get jobs eventually to pay for the fact that we needed things like food Mm-hmm, and I remember I worked at this bar cafe in the basement of RIT called the Ritz.

530
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:25,190
Scott: Yeah I went over to the the crossroad just as a brand new food court Cafeteria and I said I wanted.

531
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:35,300
Scott: they said they basically when they were opening There was like a day where they're like we need people to work here and The just guy was just like sitting at a table out in the front just having people fill out job applications.

532
00:35:35,441 --> 00:35:37,207
Scott: I went in to build one out and I was hired.

533
00:35:37,227 --> 00:35:37,950
Scott: Yep.

534
00:35:38,231 --> 00:35:40,379
Scott: I worked there from the very first day it opened to.

535
00:35:41,164 --> 00:35:49,479
Rym: For like the rest of that year freshman year Yep Me and I stopped me and someone we used to know named Greg went to the Ritz to apply and they were like you're hired You can start today.

536
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:54,000
Rym: We're like I will start tomorrow and we started the next day and it was a terrible job.

537
00:35:54,121 --> 00:36:00,999
Rym: But I made up for that by making terrible pizza And then Greg quit like he never showed up again.

538
00:36:01,602 --> 00:36:03,589
Scott: Yeah, the crossroads is an okay job.

539
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:10,160
Scott: Like when I was making subs, you know I would always make him like these huge giant subs and which you weren't supposed to do.

540
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,785
Scott: You're supposed to weigh the meat and everything Yep.

541
00:36:12,482 --> 00:36:23,400
Scott: and then when I was in the grill I would just freaking make all kinds of burgers and stuff and then I was like cutting Up fruits and making salads and it was kind of fun because mostly it was food preparing and not much dealing with idiots.

542
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:25,689
Rym: Yeah, I had to do a lot of the other end of that.

543
00:36:25,729 --> 00:36:34,740
Rym: instead of food preparing it was either well cooking pizzas which was okay or Cleaning up like the back room, which I never really had the cleaning job other people did like the dishes and stuff.

544
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:43,860
Rym: It was actually really depressing when I had to work in the back because there were a lot of full-time people who were hired By RIT being paid almost nothing and that was their career.

545
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,540
Scott: Yeah, it was crossroads didn't have that crossroads is run almost entirely by kids.

546
00:36:48,600 --> 00:37:00,211
Scott: There were like three or four Like manager people that were sometimes there sometimes not and then there were like a couple of like cook People who were like one rung lower that were full-time.

547
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:08,680
Rym: But other than that, it was all kids Yep, and then we all had other jobs like we worked on campus for various clerical or semi-technical things.

548
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,076
Scott: Yeah, I got a getting a clerical job on campus.

549
00:37:11,116 --> 00:37:19,350
Rym: It's like oh Even though you don't get paid that much I worked with the same department for like two years and all I basically had to do was review Contracts and put them in a database.

550
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:23,560
Scott: Yeah, I work for the School of Art And I was the only one in the whole building who knew anything about computers.

551
00:37:25,161 --> 00:37:25,864
Scott: Yeah, it worked out.

552
00:37:25,884 --> 00:37:28,252
Scott: Well, yeah relatively speaking.

553
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:37,955
Rym: and then actually the summer after There was one summer where we all we lived in Rochester Like all alone with no classes really and no jobs or anything.

554
00:37:37,975 --> 00:37:39,684
Scott: I Had a job.

555
00:37:39,845 --> 00:37:40,287
Scott: I worked it.

556
00:37:40,469 --> 00:37:42,300
Scott: I was working in the art building during that time still.

557
00:37:42,501 --> 00:37:46,260
Rym: Yeah, I worked for a sub shop for a while and I worked for a temp agency where I did all sorts of fun things.

558
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:54,376
Rym: I worked in a factory one day and I decided that I was I would die before I would ever work in a factory again Like it motivated me to get my degree.

559
00:37:54,436 --> 00:37:58,877
Rym: I'll say that Yep, and I worked for like a caterer once or twice like this Jewish caterer.

560
00:37:58,918 --> 00:37:59,319
Rym: That was fun.

561
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:02,802
Rym: But all the jobs we've talked about Really don't matter.

562
00:38:03,423 --> 00:38:04,905
Rym: like the interview doesn't matter.

563
00:38:05,045 --> 00:38:12,329
Rym: All they're interviewing you for is to make sure you're not a complete reject and To narrow it down from the hundred or so people who applied.

564
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:15,902
Rym: and other than that these jobs like they're trivial and you'll get one If you try.

565
00:38:16,445 --> 00:38:23,360
Rym: well, actually the job in the art building wasn't so easy to get Yeah, but to get a job of that level you would eventually gotten a job on campus.

566
00:38:23,612 --> 00:38:25,186
Rym: Yeah probably that would have paid about the same.

567
00:38:25,206 --> 00:38:31,952
Scott: the real reason that those jobs were harder to get is because Clerical jobs on campus are in high demand and low supply.

568
00:38:31,972 --> 00:38:38,820
Scott: Yeah, because they pay slightly more Yeah, and because they're a lot easier and a lot more pleasant than working in a cafeteria.

569
00:38:39,325 --> 00:38:40,660
Rym: Yeah, but there are all sorts of job.

570
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,311
Rym: I mean basically a job of that level.

571
00:38:42,472 --> 00:38:43,540
Rym: if you want one you'll get one.

572
00:38:43,701 --> 00:38:45,850
Rym: So we're not gonna really spend much as long as you try.

573
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:51,280
Scott: Yeah, and you're not a complete rejects Yeah, if you're a read that but yeah, that's basically what it comes down to.

574
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:55,040
Rym: Yeah, if you don't if you don't know if you're a complete reject or not, you probably are.

575
00:38:55,523 --> 00:39:03,676
Scott: Yeah, if you want a part-time minimum wage job Yeah, go to places as many places as you can that you would tolerate working in fill out applications.

576
00:39:04,098 --> 00:39:04,760
Scott: Just go in.

577
00:39:05,102 --> 00:39:06,940
Scott: They'll talk to you to make sure you're not an idiot.

578
00:39:07,221 --> 00:39:12,300
Scott: They'll teach you how to do whatever the menial labor that you're gonna do is and you'll do it and then you'll get paid.

579
00:39:12,841 --> 00:39:13,243
Scott: That's it.

580
00:39:13,704 --> 00:39:14,346
Scott: That's all you got to do.

581
00:39:14,827 --> 00:39:17,917
Rym: So we're going to spend the rest of the time talking about real jobs.

582
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:22,473
Scott: Oh Wow, I've had I guess two real jobs.

583
00:39:22,633 --> 00:39:24,360
Rym: Yeah, I would say that I've had two.

584
00:39:24,822 --> 00:39:36,785
Rym: I mean I worked for the ITS which is like the IT department at RIT and When I interviewed with them, I was so highly qualified that they were like, we don't have any work for you You're you're beyond this.

585
00:39:37,307 --> 00:39:45,279
Rym: and they ended up giving me a special job where I didn't really report to anyone and I was like a project implementer and I went around like implementing projects.

586
00:39:46,542 --> 00:39:49,958
Rym: I'm not I won't go to the details of it, but it was fun and it paid decently.

587
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:54,959
Scott: Yeah, the first real job I got was a co-op with the company that our friend James works for.

588
00:39:55,401 --> 00:40:02,303
Scott: Oh, yeah, I forgot about getting that job wasn't really like getting other jobs because you know James There.

589
00:40:02,865 --> 00:40:04,710
Scott: so it was kind of like a secret in.

590
00:40:05,332 --> 00:40:07,600
Scott: so that's that's the first way to get a job.

591
00:40:08,063 --> 00:40:11,469
Scott: No, someone there get a secret in back door.

592
00:40:11,489 --> 00:40:16,660
Rym: I I would say that that is the primary way to get a good job in this world today.

593
00:40:17,062 --> 00:40:20,660
Rym: You have to have some sort of in or something or you're really kind of screwed.

594
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:22,163
Scott: Yeah, think about it.

595
00:40:22,203 --> 00:40:27,722
Scott: If someone is slightly more qualified than you and you're just going up against them like directly You're not gonna win.

596
00:40:28,224 --> 00:40:30,634
Scott: You've got a you know, no someone at the company.

597
00:40:30,935 --> 00:40:37,380
Scott: You got to maybe have a relative You know, maybe you can even find a relatives relative or a friend's friend or that stuff actually works.

598
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,609
Scott: You just talk to someone.

599
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:44,296
Scott: Yeah, they know you Someone they know better than you says good things about you and there you go.

600
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:48,580
Rym: No, really The a lot of people say oh when you're in college, you've got a network.

601
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:53,297
Rym: You've got a network and it may sound silly but that is really the primary benefit of college.

602
00:40:53,699 --> 00:41:03,880
Rym: college You'll learn stuff, but you could learn that stuff on your own College is primarily the enjoyment and the learning how to live in the real world and most importantly the meeting people.

603
00:41:04,581 --> 00:41:10,970
Rym: It's like if you have enough money to go to college you're paying for the privilege of meeting the people you'll need to know in Order to succeed later in life.

604
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:24,520
Scott: Mm-hmm They can't tell you like some of the people that I know Like from different places that later came and helped me out with something Like even like the guy who was in charge of that summer camp that I only worked at for one summer.

605
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:27,039
Scott: Like because of him I got like two jobs.

606
00:41:27,682 --> 00:41:28,505
Scott: Yep, it's like.

607
00:41:28,546 --> 00:41:32,701
Scott: all I got to do is tell someone to call him and he says these great things about me and then I Get a job.

608
00:41:33,444 --> 00:41:33,624
Rym: like.

609
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:38,300
Rym: we know some people who made friends with professors and met people then they got jobs through those people.

610
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:49,360
Rym: We also know some people who graduated with actually better grades than most of us But they didn't really know anyone and they didn't really make Like networking type friends or they didn't really meet anyone.

611
00:41:49,701 --> 00:41:54,919
Rym: I don't want to sound cynical but useful and as a result despite the fact that they're talented they'd never found work.

612
00:41:56,042 --> 00:41:57,119
Scott: Yeah, I don't get it.

613
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:03,906
Scott: There are people with the same exact degree or an equivalent degree to the one that I've got and I have a high-paying Professional technical job.

614
00:42:03,946 --> 00:42:04,388
Scott: that were.

615
00:42:04,428 --> 00:42:19,828
Scott: you know, don't talk about how my job does nothing but the fact is that someone hired me and is willing to pay me a lot of money and other people with similar qualifications did not obtain the same level of Success in this department if you consider it success.

616
00:42:19,968 --> 00:42:26,378
Rym: Yeah, and even though they might have wanted to so another little bit of advice that Grades don't matter so much.

617
00:42:27,283 --> 00:42:29,552
Scott: Yeah, there's some people who will.

618
00:42:29,572 --> 00:42:31,340
Scott: it really depends on where you're going.

619
00:42:31,501 --> 00:42:38,700
Scott: Yeah, some people if they hire someone right out of college They want to look at that GPA number and compare it to other people's GPA numbers.

620
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,254
Rym: Yep, like when I got heard by IBM, they had a policy of if you don't have a 3.4.

621
00:42:42,254 --> 00:42:48,819
Scott: We won't consider you Yep, but if you don't care about working for a big company, usually they won't care about your GPA.

622
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:57,178
Scott: Yeah, and here's another secret Once you have work experience the more work your job your GP doesn't matter anymore.

623
00:42:57,539 --> 00:42:59,577
Rym: Yep I mean why worked at IBM as a co-op?

624
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:07,459
Rym: So IBM appeared on my resume and I have not wanted for job offers since then Mm-hmm, even though I currently still work at IBM.

625
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:15,380
Scott: But it's like if your only qualification is I got a degree from college and you're going for a job You got to put that GPA on there and it better be high.

626
00:43:15,742 --> 00:43:22,431
Rym: Yeah, and if you've got any sort of special things like I was the National Merit Scholar Finalist so I stuck that on there and any kind of.

627
00:43:22,491 --> 00:43:28,194
Rym: if you're on the Dean's list stick that on there Yep, but once you have a real job somewhere anywhere, none of that stuff matters.

628
00:43:28,234 --> 00:43:30,764
Scott: erase all that stuff right off the resume Cuz no one cares anymore.

629
00:43:30,804 --> 00:43:30,945
Rym: Yep.

630
00:43:31,005 --> 00:43:33,315
Rym: In fact at that point you want to flip your resume around.

631
00:43:33,415 --> 00:43:34,540
Rym: talk about resumes real quick.

632
00:43:34,748 --> 00:43:36,846
Rym: Yeah The basic format of a resume.

633
00:43:37,308 --> 00:43:45,240
Rym: and I will say one thing that I've had a lot of people tell me Especially counselors in school like oh your resume shouldn't be the way you've done it.

634
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,800
Rym: You should do it this standard way that everyone does like the books say whatever.

635
00:43:50,042 --> 00:43:54,780
Rym: And I found that to be largely stupid because I actually have been complimented on my resume.

636
00:43:55,342 --> 00:44:03,808
Rym: So basically do whatever you think looks good and seems professional and unless an employer says something about your resume Don't listen to your counselors so much.

637
00:44:04,129 --> 00:44:07,100
Scott: Yeah, it's like the college wants to make everything real easy.

638
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:10,093
Scott: So they come up with like this standard format and they're like everyone.

639
00:44:10,375 --> 00:44:11,600
Scott: do your thing in this format.

640
00:44:11,721 --> 00:44:13,154
Scott: it works really well or whatever.

641
00:44:13,496 --> 00:44:15,520
Scott: but Employers really don't care.

642
00:44:15,681 --> 00:44:17,830
Scott: All you have to do is make sure it's readable.

643
00:44:18,312 --> 00:44:20,039
Scott: make sure it's formatted nicely.

644
00:44:20,703 --> 00:44:21,909
Rym: No spelling errors.

645
00:44:21,989 --> 00:44:24,240
Rym: if there is any typo on your resume, you won't get hired.

646
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,906
Scott: Yeah, there's some things the counselors tell you.

647
00:44:25,946 --> 00:44:28,657
Scott: that's that's that aren't stupid and that's spelling errors.

648
00:44:28,737 --> 00:44:29,460
Scott: No one will hire you.

649
00:44:29,782 --> 00:44:32,160
Rym: Yeah, don't make it more than two pages.

650
00:44:32,501 --> 00:44:33,906
Rym: Probably don't make it more than one.

651
00:44:33,946 --> 00:44:37,900
Rym: You probably want like a normal one-page resume and an extended two-page resume.

652
00:44:38,362 --> 00:44:40,591
Scott: Yeah, if you really have that much stuff to put on there.

653
00:44:40,691 --> 00:44:41,012
Rym: I do.

654
00:44:41,093 --> 00:44:48,260
Scott: Yeah, which is my resume is huge now Yeah, but yeah one pay a one-page thing is really good because then you just kind of hand them out like their business cards.

655
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:52,519
Rym: But yeah, but if you go in for the job interview you bring the extended one that has like everything in it.

656
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,463
Scott: Yeah, they're like here.

657
00:44:53,503 --> 00:44:56,653
Scott: check this out and then people go through it like oh

658
00:44:56,833 --> 00:45:08,607
Rym: now the general format that I would suggest Really depends on whether or not you have had significant work experience yet if you're in college or fresh out of college I suggest Information about your degree and about you at the top.

659
00:45:08,968 --> 00:45:14,264
Rym: Yeah, then your qualifications and skills and then Your previous work experience.

660
00:45:14,826 --> 00:45:15,006
Scott: Yep.

661
00:45:15,508 --> 00:45:19,740
Scott: That's that's what I did on my and basically one skip the jobs that were stupid.

662
00:45:20,861 --> 00:45:29,252
Scott: well, what I did is I had a whole bunch of jobs and what I did is I list the jobs in chronological order and Then I list the the skills that I got from those jobs.

663
00:45:29,292 --> 00:45:34,820
Scott: Yep, you know like at that job I learned I dealt with because you want to know what you did at the job.

664
00:45:35,162 --> 00:45:38,020
Scott: You know if you just write I was this that doesn't know don't lie.

665
00:45:38,422 --> 00:45:40,174
Rym: But and it pad it out.

666
00:45:40,215 --> 00:45:50,593
Rym: now by pad it out I mean if you were an office clerk, don't just say office clerk say what you actually did like data entry HR Management blah blah blah is an example of what you want to do.

667
00:45:50,694 --> 00:45:56,209
Scott: I was at a dry cleaner basically Sorting clothing, but I also had to deal with customers.

668
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:59,640
Scott: So I wrote gained valuable customer service.

669
00:46:00,462 --> 00:46:05,844
Scott: you know techniques or something like that, you know, I learned how to deal with people and I kind of did.

670
00:46:06,366 --> 00:46:10,240
Scott: but yeah, it looks a lot better than stood around folding shirts.

671
00:46:10,974 --> 00:46:15,059
Rym: Yes Like when I was a clerk for the IP office at RIT.

672
00:46:15,541 --> 00:46:30,886
Rym: all I really did was type things into a database and hit enter basically just data entry, but I was like alphanumeric and ten key data entry and I met all this sort of office clerical terms for all the various things I did like Filing and all that.

673
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,819
Rym: Yep pad it out, but don't pad it out stupidly.

674
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:41,356
Rym: If your job was like a server at McDonald's don't call it like interfaced with customers in a sales environment.

675
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,267
Rym: Yeah, that's that people can.

676
00:46:44,287 --> 00:46:44,568
Rym: in fact

677
00:46:44,628 --> 00:46:49,648
Scott: if you work at McDonald's don't put that on there unless you're applying to work at another McDonald's or Burger King or something

678
00:46:49,668 --> 00:46:59,066
Rym: or if you don't have any job experience at all or You work there for so long that you have to put it because employers are at this stage If you don't have a lot of work experience, there's.

679
00:46:59,307 --> 00:47:01,835
Rym: they really want to see something there that proves.

680
00:47:02,196 --> 00:47:03,400
Rym: Yeah, he can hold a job.

681
00:47:04,101 --> 00:47:05,326
Rym: Yeah, he wasn't just a bum.

682
00:47:05,747 --> 00:47:15,833
Scott: and if you have like a giant hole like let's say I did a job and then I did Another job that sucked that I did it and then I did a good job and now I'm applying for yet another job And I leave the crappy job out.

683
00:47:16,196 --> 00:47:16,880
Scott: Some guy's gonna go.

684
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:21,980
Scott: What did you do for those years in that hole there, you know, cuz you have to write down when you worked at the jobs.

685
00:47:22,281 --> 00:47:29,386
Rym: Yep, now they really won't do this again if you're inexperienced, but once you're but once you have work experience It's obvious when you left something out.

686
00:47:29,406 --> 00:47:32,560
Rym: Mm-hmm, and they really don't want to hear I was unemployed.

687
00:47:33,321 --> 00:47:37,840
Scott: Yeah, they'll be like, oh really yeah, I'm not hiring you you're gonna be unemployed for a while.

688
00:47:37,883 --> 00:47:44,459
Rym: Yes I'll say this make something up if you have to just like I was working on personal projects or I Needed a break or something.

689
00:47:44,741 --> 00:47:46,387
Rym: Don't just say I couldn't find work.

690
00:47:46,648 --> 00:47:48,114
Scott: at least come if you have to.

691
00:47:48,134 --> 00:47:53,014
Scott: you can come up with an elaborate lie Like I was on the tour the world vacation or something.

692
00:47:53,034 --> 00:47:57,289
Rym: Yeah, or a sabbatical Sabbatical is a real good word.

693
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:57,691
Scott: Yeah.

694
00:47:57,812 --> 00:47:58,757
Scott: or something like.

695
00:48:00,382 --> 00:48:16,640
Scott: You know something that sounds really interesting like I was practicing with some team Somewhere or I was developing open source Yeah, or I was researching something with some guy or I went to you know to a monastery to meditate or something.

696
00:48:16,701 --> 00:48:17,659
Scott: That'll start a conversation.

697
00:48:17,952 --> 00:48:34,060
Rym: Yeah because the main thing and I can't stress this enough you want to stand out from all the other people and I don't want to say that all attention is good attention because there are things you can do that make you stand out in a Bad way, but generally anything you do that makes you stand out at all is a good thing.

698
00:48:34,723 --> 00:48:43,277
Rym: If you don't do anything that makes you stand out get ready for a life of shit Yep, because everyone will ignore you and job interviews and you'll end up with the crap job where they want a drone.

699
00:48:43,297 --> 00:48:50,316
Scott: Yep So the stuff that makes you stand out is you know the stuff you do normally like.

700
00:48:50,356 --> 00:48:55,254
Scott: if I did a resume right now I'd put like GeekNights podcast host and all that kind of stuff.

701
00:48:55,274 --> 00:49:01,419
Rym: Yeah, I list all the websites We run and like yeah, I'd half sysadmin and half, you know, maintain the community blah blah blah.

702
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:07,203
Rym: Yeah, I put all sorts of audio engineering studio recording type stuff because outside of GeekNights I know about that.

703
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:13,489
Rym: if you have a hobby that is in any way related to work or even if it's just something Interesting or technical put it on there.

704
00:49:14,032 --> 00:49:14,173
Rym: Mm-hmm.

705
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:19,497
Rym: If you're a Professional mountain biker you could seriously put like professional mountain biker if you really are.

706
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:22,040
Scott: Yep Don't lie on the resume.

707
00:49:22,061 --> 00:49:32,520
Scott: Yeah Don't you don't want to don't say like Professional lion tamer and mountain climber because someone will catch you and you'll be screwed or even worse You'll get the job and later they'll catch you and then you'll really be screwed.

708
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:37,820
Rym: Yep, like if I got hired by someone now and say years from now the company says we want to do a podcast.

709
00:49:38,462 --> 00:49:40,269
Rym: You you know audio engineering you're on top.

710
00:49:40,289 --> 00:49:41,754
Rym: You're on top of that Brandon Rym.

711
00:49:41,775 --> 00:49:42,276
Rym: You're hired.

712
00:49:42,678 --> 00:49:46,440
Rym: do that now That's your new department and you lied and you don't know audio engineering.

713
00:49:47,221 --> 00:49:49,449
Rym: You're done you're done.

714
00:49:49,469 --> 00:49:50,091
Scott: there are laws.

715
00:49:50,131 --> 00:49:50,874
Scott: I think about that.

716
00:49:50,974 --> 00:49:51,335
Scott: actually.

717
00:49:51,395 --> 00:49:54,715
Scott: not only that but you'll be blackballed You'll be in big trouble.

718
00:49:55,099 --> 00:49:57,685
Rym: now I know I said The format of the resume.

719
00:49:58,107 --> 00:50:07,962
Rym: once you have at least one good job like a real job Like I worked for IBM or I worked for Microsoft or Google or a big company or that's what you want to put up the top there.

720
00:50:08,063 --> 00:50:09,308
Rym: at that point you switch.

721
00:50:09,951 --> 00:50:13,322
Rym: now your resume goes your name and Qualifications.

722
00:50:13,463 --> 00:50:14,205
Rym: by qualifications.

723
00:50:14,225 --> 00:50:27,209
Rym: I mean the degree you have and if you have any certifications, whatever those two and then your work experience in order and the skills you have from those jobs the duties you had in those jobs and then Skills that aren't listed there.

724
00:50:27,631 --> 00:50:28,215
Scott: You want to put.

725
00:50:28,597 --> 00:50:34,554
Scott: actually We know when I got out of college My resume was my oldest job first down to the newest one.

726
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:35,377
Scott: now flip it.

727
00:50:35,598 --> 00:50:40,100
Scott: flip it Newest job at the top because the new it the most recent job is gonna be the most awesome job.

728
00:50:40,342 --> 00:50:42,760
Rym: Yep, also that way it's a nice reverse chronological order.

729
00:50:42,981 --> 00:50:46,234
Rym: Yep, you don't want him to see office clerk for crap.

730
00:50:46,274 --> 00:50:47,740
Rym: Oh company in high school first.

731
00:50:47,921 --> 00:50:50,360
Rym: In fact, you probably want to lop all that stuff off the resume at that point.

732
00:50:50,509 --> 00:50:52,145
Scott: Yeah only put as much as you can fit.

733
00:50:52,265 --> 00:51:04,448
Scott: put all the other stuff besides the jobs in the resume in the order it has to Be in and then keep inserting jobs into that middle part until you run out of space and I'll tell you that in general No employer cares about the job.

734
00:51:04,468 --> 00:51:08,516
Rym: you had more than three jobs ago unless it's terribly relevant to the job You're gonna do now.

735
00:51:09,101 --> 00:51:19,192
Scott: Yeah, like if I was a painter and then I was a carpenter and then I was a computer guy and now I'm trying to Be a plumber they they kind of care about the old painting and carpeting jobs.

736
00:51:19,532 --> 00:51:19,953
Rym: Yeah.

737
00:51:20,194 --> 00:51:27,478
Rym: Yeah now in terms of standing out When you interview with people, there are a lot of tricks and a lot of things.

738
00:51:27,598 --> 00:51:33,117
Rym: the main thing I want to stress now is that everyone tells everyone how to dress and the counselors were notorious for this.

739
00:51:33,137 --> 00:51:33,759
Rym: because I went to.

740
00:51:33,779 --> 00:51:38,346
Rym: I went to the interview with IBM right and Everyone was dressed identically.

741
00:51:38,366 --> 00:51:45,989
Rym: they were all wearing like the exact same blue suit white shirt red tie Yes, or some minor variation thereof.

742
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:47,213
Rym: like everyone looked identical.

743
00:51:47,654 --> 00:51:49,400
Scott: I just always wore the only suit I had.

744
00:51:49,782 --> 00:51:50,164
Rym: You know what?

745
00:51:50,405 --> 00:51:52,919
Rym: I until recently never wore suits to interviews.

746
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:57,953
Rym: No Instead I wore a nice shirt good pants a thin tie and some.

747
00:51:58,033 --> 00:51:59,377
Rym: I would some sort of stylish thing.

748
00:51:59,918 --> 00:52:09,200
Rym: a lot of times I'd wear a sport jacket and a t-shirt and then nice pants Things like that because then you really stand out as you because everyone else looks like a cookie cookie cutter.

749
00:52:09,261 --> 00:52:11,560
Rym: Okay, the counselor told him to dress like that.

750
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,043
Rym: This guy's like.

751
00:52:12,063 --> 00:52:15,302
Scott: well, that's if we're going to like some sort of multiple people interview Even

752
00:52:15,322 --> 00:52:25,461
Rym: if you're not even if you're going anywhere if you look like the standard Like guy going for an interview you don't stand out and they know that you just listen to whatever website or counselor told you how To dress.

753
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:26,905
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

754
00:52:27,286 --> 00:52:30,133
Rym: I've had a lot of good luck by just dressing the way I dress.

755
00:52:30,193 --> 00:52:31,296
Rym: Anyway, just snazzier.

756
00:52:31,316 --> 00:52:37,560
Scott: I Just wore the only suit I had when I had an interview and no one seemed to care and it worked whatever.

757
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:44,877
Rym: Yeah, the other thing is if you can work into the conversation things that are fairly complementary to you.

758
00:52:44,897 --> 00:52:52,512
Rym: I Mean I really to this day think that the main reason I was originally hired by IBM way back was that I went to this like luncheon.

759
00:52:52,573 --> 00:52:58,399
Rym: IBM was putting on before and I knew that the people who were gonna be interviewing were in this room.

760
00:52:59,241 --> 00:53:08,318
Rym: So I was talking with some people just other students who were also vying for jobs and someone brought up high school and They mentioned like an AP class or something.

761
00:53:09,069 --> 00:53:15,550
Rym: so I went on a roll with that and talked about all the AP classes I took and we had this long conversation about AP classes and advanced stuff.

762
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:25,460
Rym: and I Spoke in such a way that because I noticed at this point that one of the people who I thought was recruiter was obviously Obviously listening to our conversation but trying to act like he wasn't.

763
00:53:26,981 --> 00:53:34,900
Rym: So I really talked myself up and sure enough that guy told another Recruiter about me and I got a job as a result.

764
00:53:36,461 --> 00:53:40,298
Rym: I'm reasonably certain that that was the primary thing that had caused them to have an interest in me.

765
00:53:41,422 --> 00:53:44,358
Scott: Yeah, I just never want to interviewed for the job I have right now.

766
00:53:45,203 --> 00:53:48,219
Scott: You know cuz my boss is kind of cool even though he doesn't give me any work to do.

767
00:53:48,821 --> 00:53:52,976
Scott: But he asked me questions about like, you know, so what's your favorite editor?

768
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:53,658
Scott: and you got.

769
00:53:53,698 --> 00:53:56,028
Scott: you got it You know, if you know your shit, you'll have an answer.

770
00:53:56,169 --> 00:54:00,839
Rym: But if you don't know your shit, you know, it's it's yeah No your shit because they will call you on it.

771
00:54:01,081 --> 00:54:05,179
Scott: Yeah, if you're unless if they don't call you on it, then it's not a job you want to work at.

772
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:08,353
Rym: Yeah, now they'll a lot of time like a few jobs.

773
00:54:08,413 --> 00:54:10,040
Rym: I interviewed that they they like me.

774
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:15,122
Rym: So then they called in the techie guy and they were like, all right grill him to make sure he's not bullshitting or something To that effect.

775
00:54:15,423 --> 00:54:19,257
Rym: Mm-hmm and the guy asked like just generic questions about Linux and networking.

776
00:54:19,277 --> 00:54:22,419
Rym: He was like What do you type if you want to know blood?

777
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,431
Rym: I was like well blah or blah depending on the distribution.

778
00:54:25,035 --> 00:54:28,847
Rym: He's like, all right Apache where do the log files go?

779
00:54:28,867 --> 00:54:33,178
Rym: and I was like, well, they go here or here depending on blah and he's like All right, this guy knows what he's talking about.

780
00:54:34,201 --> 00:54:35,285
Rym: If you don't know they'll know.

781
00:54:35,847 --> 00:54:36,088
Scott: Yep.

782
00:54:36,128 --> 00:54:36,711
Scott: They sure will.

783
00:54:37,052 --> 00:54:40,561
Scott: I remember when I applied to work at What was?

784
00:54:40,702 --> 00:54:42,969
Scott: it was some online store or something?

785
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:48,549
Scott: I never I didn't actually work there, but the guy asked me like all the hippies It was something kind of like hippies.

786
00:54:48,871 --> 00:54:49,655
Rym: Yeah, I remember that.

787
00:54:49,675 --> 00:55:01,160
Scott: I don't know But that guy it was it was a Java web development job and they asked me some pretty like Is the kind of questions that ask you in a test in computer science class?

788
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,765
Scott: Like what's the word for this?

789
00:55:02,845 --> 00:55:04,270
Scott: and I'm like, oh, I don't know.

790
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:08,826
Scott: or like name the three properties and I was like, uh Wow, I've never had anyone do that to me.

791
00:55:09,127 --> 00:55:11,858
Scott: and I was just like are you reading from some textbook or something?

792
00:55:11,878 --> 00:55:17,086
Scott: Geez But then the job I had now they were like, you know What languages do you know?

793
00:55:17,227 --> 00:55:23,030
Scott: this and this and this and this and this because I know a shit ton of languages Computer languages anyway, I only know one speaking language.

794
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:26,160
Scott: now just then they were like, you know pearl like.

795
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:26,983
Scott: no I don't know pearl.

796
00:55:27,003 --> 00:55:27,566
Scott: I hate pearl.

797
00:55:28,369 --> 00:55:30,700
Scott: and then they're like, do you know who wrote pearl and I'm like Larry Wall?

798
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:35,197
Scott: They're like, uh, cuz if I didn't get that if I didn't know that they would have been like you.

799
00:55:35,217 --> 00:55:37,805
Scott: just you know Some shit talking now.

800
00:55:37,885 --> 00:55:39,249
Rym: That's a big thing.

801
00:55:39,329 --> 00:55:40,573
Rym: that don't be a shit talker.

802
00:55:40,994 --> 00:55:44,903
Rym: just because you touched an HPU X system.

803
00:55:44,923 --> 00:55:52,370
Rym: let's say once or like you worked at a company that you know used web sphere Don't put web sphere on your resume unless you know it.

804
00:55:52,651 --> 00:55:53,736
Rym: god damn like.

805
00:55:54,198 --> 00:55:59,412
Rym: I know HP UX enough because I worked on a system helping some idiots fix it a bunch of times.

806
00:55:59,933 --> 00:56:01,076
Rym: so I can put it on my resume.

807
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:07,600
Rym: I Know that my department uses AIX and I have touched an AIX box once or twice.

808
00:56:08,604 --> 00:56:09,656
Rym: We use X extensively.

809
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:14,195
Rym: I don't put AIX on my resume because I am not terribly familiar with it.

810
00:56:14,577 --> 00:56:17,528
Rym: and while I could learn it I'm not gonna lie and say I know it because I don't.

811
00:56:17,789 --> 00:56:18,431
Scott: here's another thing.

812
00:56:18,893 --> 00:56:19,857
Scott: Let's say you know something.

813
00:56:19,897 --> 00:56:24,263
Scott: Let's say you know Z80 assembler.

814
00:56:24,523 --> 00:56:31,373
Scott: All right, right and you're applying for some job where they might want you to do Z80 assembler But you don't want to do it.

815
00:56:32,181 --> 00:56:38,182
Scott: or let's say you want to put your resume online, but you don't actually want to code Z80 assembler because it's it's Painful.

816
00:56:38,925 --> 00:56:39,969
Scott: don't put it on there.

817
00:56:40,411 --> 00:56:41,555
Scott: Yeah, you don't put it on there.

818
00:56:41,575 --> 00:56:42,499
Scott: No one will make you do it.

819
00:56:43,283 --> 00:56:46,558
Scott: You know if you know something that you don't want to do don't write it.

820
00:56:47,021 --> 00:56:51,376
Rym: Yep, and if you if you out there know web sphere There's a million jobs for you.

821
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:57,258
Rym: But a lot of people who know web sphere don't like it and don't want to do it So they pretend they don't know anything about.

822
00:56:57,278 --> 00:57:01,496
Scott: yeah There are a lot of things like a lot of in computers because that's what I know most about.

823
00:57:01,536 --> 00:57:08,860
Scott: there are a lot of skill Sets where if you know like a combination of things there are like a hundred high-paying jobs for you at any moment in time.

824
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:15,766
Rym: yep, the big ones right now that I've seen are good software engineer and All the things that go along with that.

825
00:57:15,886 --> 00:57:24,847
Scott: a good thing to know is if you know like Java j2e plus oracle plus You know that sort of thing.

826
00:57:24,887 --> 00:57:31,089
Rym: Yeah any sort of like enterprise style web application development using Java That'll make you a ton of money.

827
00:57:31,149 --> 00:57:33,480
Rym: J boss web sphere all those things.

828
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:38,340
Rym: You only need to know one of them because if you know one you could probably deal with the rest of them even dotnet.

829
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:40,010
Scott: There's a whole bunch of high-paying jobs now.

830
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:41,520
Scott: Here's the other thing all those jobs suck.

831
00:57:41,901 --> 00:57:44,210
Rym: Yes, writing that code sucks ass.

832
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:46,499
Rym: writing Java for a company usually sucks ass

833
00:57:47,282 --> 00:58:01,359
Scott: But those jobs are high paying and not too many people know all those things because the only way to learn those things is To either read a damn book about it or go work for a company that you know will let you do it and learn it before Hiring you to do it in the first place.

834
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:07,524
Rym: Yep, the only people who actually know web sphere are people who already work for IBM Now.

835
00:58:07,585 --> 00:58:15,640
Rym: another big one right now is databases DBAs database administrators people who do databases or maintain databases or design databases.

836
00:58:16,162 --> 00:58:22,807
Rym: And I will tell you right now that when I went to RIT they told me yeah If you concentrate in databases, you'll make six figures immediately.

837
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:25,533
Rym: and I thought ooh, and I took the introductory database class.

838
00:58:26,435 --> 00:58:29,063
Rym: I The class.

839
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:33,180
Rym: I vowed to never take a database class again, and I don't care how much money they pay me.

840
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:35,229
Rym: I would never be a DBA ever.

841
00:58:35,771 --> 00:58:36,675
Rym: It's not worth it.

842
00:58:36,715 --> 00:58:37,699
Rym: I'd rather be a ditch digger.

843
00:58:38,201 --> 00:58:41,857
Scott: Yeah, ditch digging ain't so bad actually, but um no it's like.

844
00:58:41,897 --> 00:58:42,480
Scott: I took a database.

845
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:48,460
Scott: I knew databases are big so I thought I'd go learn about him, so I took like a PHP MySQL database class.

846
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:57,200
Rym: It was actually sort of required kind of well I took like this high level like here are the fundamentals of databases and SQL and designing them and normalizing them.

847
00:58:57,621 --> 00:59:10,381
Scott: Yeah, when they get into that stuff like normalizing and optimizing and all that other like high level database stuff I can't take it, but then now my current job It's like normal level stuff like you make a table you put some data in it Yeah,

848
00:59:10,461 --> 00:59:10,803
Rym: or my

849
00:59:10,823 --> 00:59:13,093
Scott: simple select and a join that stuff.

850
00:59:13,113 --> 00:59:13,676
Scott: I don't mind.

851
00:59:13,837 --> 00:59:18,076
Rym: Yeah like one job I was looking at they said like you know databases, and I thought crap.

852
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:21,693
Rym: and I was like yeah I know database theory and I know SQL and blah blah blah.

853
00:59:21,713 --> 00:59:23,140
Rym: and they were like no we don't care about that.

854
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:27,903
Rym: Could you back up like a MySQL database, and I'm like Yeah, and they're like.

855
00:59:27,943 --> 00:59:29,367
Rym: and then they they're like well, how do you do that?

856
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:31,593
Rym: I was like my SQL dump.

857
00:59:31,613 --> 00:59:32,957
Rym: They're like oh, okay.

858
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:38,396
Scott: Yep Yeah, very few people actually want the the craziness.

859
00:59:38,939 --> 00:59:41,645
Rym: yeah And if they do they'll pay you six figures.

860
00:59:41,746 --> 00:59:42,789
Rym: databases if you have.

861
00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:50,986
Scott: it's like chartered accountancy used to be in like the 70s All right, so if you want a job Step one get skills.

862
00:59:51,228 --> 00:59:53,800
Scott: if you don't have skills no one will hire to you to use the skills.

863
00:59:54,001 --> 00:59:56,274
Scott: And you have to have something to prove you have the skills.

864
00:59:56,314 --> 00:59:57,279
Scott: you can't just say you have them.

865
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:06,900
Rym: Yep, now the only way to prove it is to either have a bunch of work experience Which I know is against 22 already yep, or have a Bachelor of Science in the technical field.

866
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:10,156
Rym: We're not talking about creative jobs because we know nothing about them.

867
01:00:10,317 --> 01:00:10,940
Scott: No not at all.

868
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:13,695
Rym: We have a lot of friends who need like portfolios and shit for that.

869
01:00:13,816 --> 01:00:14,258
Scott: I don't get it.

870
01:00:14,279 --> 01:00:22,940
Rym: yeah To all of our artist friends out there if you give us audio feedback We'll do a second series on like other kinds of jobs that we don't know about and we'll gladly play what you have to say.

871
01:00:23,222 --> 01:00:25,340
Scott: Yeah, how to make a freaking portfolio and shit.

872
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:25,922
Scott: I don't know that.

873
01:00:26,002 --> 01:00:30,680
Rym: we're talking specifically about tech jobs and like science jobs not even so much science jobs.

874
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:31,803
Rym: We don't know much about that either.

875
01:00:32,244 --> 01:00:34,952
Scott: Yeah engineer jobs or it falls in.

876
01:00:35,533 --> 01:00:38,565
Rym: yeah engineering jobs are similar to what we do pretty much Almost exactly.

877
01:00:38,666 --> 01:00:47,177
Rym: I mean we're basically engineers Just like I'm a network engineer and Scott is a software engineer, but yeah same kind of engineer computers instead of a.

878
01:00:47,478 --> 01:00:51,268
Scott: you know Chips yeah and gears, but basically it.

879
01:00:51,329 --> 01:00:58,800
Rym: the in the order of usefulness for getting jobs in a technical field are If it's a software job a master's.

880
01:01:00,222 --> 01:01:02,729
Rym: If it's not a software job a master's is almost useless.

881
01:01:03,331 --> 01:01:05,458
Rym: a master's in IT is completely useless.

882
01:01:05,498 --> 01:01:18,820
Scott: as far as I'm concerned Masters are usually good for if you want to work somewhere writing really complex fancy algorithms and things like Google Writing search if you want to be doing research or doing like pioneering new things you need your masters or a doctor.

883
01:01:19,222 --> 01:01:19,926
Scott: Yeah doctor.

884
01:01:20,046 --> 01:01:22,780
Scott: usually though you end up being a professor and not so much.

885
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:32,148
Rym: Yeah, they'll end up going into academia, which I've considered yeah, but basically for normal jobs in the normal scale a Bachelor of Science or Good work experience.

886
01:01:32,168 --> 01:01:34,019
Rym: The two of those are equal and they are gold.

887
01:01:34,663 --> 01:01:46,475
Scott: Also gold is if you have a lot of skills But you don't have a job because let's say you got the skills and you were young and you have no way to prove You have the skills to get the first job all the projects you did for yourself.

888
01:01:46,836 --> 01:01:47,840
Scott: throw them all on there.

889
01:01:48,282 --> 01:01:50,614
Rym: That'll make people go and that's also a secondary.

890
01:01:50,695 --> 01:01:53,245
Rym: if you're between jobs And you're a techie in any way.

891
01:01:53,265 --> 01:01:57,360
Rym: do stuff like just pick a board game you like and try to write it out.

892
01:01:58,322 --> 01:01:58,927
Scott: Do something.

893
01:01:59,230 --> 01:02:03,430
Scott: yeah, you're like a Engineer make a car or design something.

894
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:06,740
Scott: or if you're an architect like design a house in your spare time or whatever.

895
01:02:07,183 --> 01:02:09,820
Rym: Even if you're an artist just start working on that novel you've been putting off.

896
01:02:10,722 --> 01:02:17,651
Scott: Do something because if you don't do anything your skills will deteriorate And you won't have anything to say that you were doing.

897
01:02:18,053 --> 01:02:23,000
Rym: and yeah, yep now I said Bachelor of Science specifically for these jobs.

898
01:02:23,321 --> 01:02:29,920
Rym: There are schools out there who for various reasons will give a Bachelor of the Arts in things like computer science information technology.

899
01:02:30,002 --> 01:02:35,592
Rym: No good Seriously, if you're if you have one of those degrees you're on your way to get one.

900
01:02:35,973 --> 01:02:43,380
Rym: you got boned unless you're paying almost nothing Because that means they really couldn't get their program accredited as a science degree.

901
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:46,391
Scott: In other words they're not gonna teach you shit,

902
01:02:46,874 --> 01:02:57,114
Rym: or they'll teach you great stuff But they give you a weak degree, and then everyone's gonna ask you forever How come you have a Bachelor of the Arts and they'll give you guff about it mm-hmm

903
01:02:57,676 --> 01:02:58,859
Scott: and now lie and write a BS?

904
01:02:59,401 --> 01:03:01,848
Scott: They'll catch you on it yep, and then you're in big trouble.

905
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:04,054
Rym: IBM actually makes you show them your diploma.

906
01:03:04,575 --> 01:03:05,438
Scott: Oh really yeah.

907
01:03:05,458 --> 01:03:11,672
Rym: Wow Now a bachelor an associate's degree I Really don't want to sound condescending.

908
01:03:11,733 --> 01:03:12,800
Rym: It's almost useless.

909
01:03:12,981 --> 01:03:15,468
Rym: That's the equivalent of having like a Cisco certification.

910
01:03:15,749 --> 01:03:16,271
Scott: think about this.

911
01:03:16,331 --> 01:03:17,796
Scott: if you have an associate's degree.

912
01:03:18,197 --> 01:03:19,020
Scott: I'm gonna be your boss.

913
01:03:19,744 --> 01:03:22,060
Scott: You're basically just gonna be some lackey that I wear.

914
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:26,600
Rym: I'll put it in terms of IT if you have a master's you're working or a doctorate.

915
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:30,237
Rym: You're either at a university or you're working at Google like coming up with the new fiber.

916
01:03:30,257 --> 01:03:30,679
Rym: cool thing.

917
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:38,408
Rym: If you have a bachelors of science you are like the guy who surveys a site and says all right We need switches in these closets.

918
01:03:38,448 --> 01:03:40,520
Rym: network goes like this this kind of stuff.

919
01:03:41,266 --> 01:03:42,697
Rym: I'm gonna hire people to do this for you.

920
01:03:43,281 --> 01:03:49,749
Rym: If you have an associate's degree or like a Cisco cert you're the guy sitting in the closet making $10 an hour punching down All the cables.

921
01:03:50,216 --> 01:03:52,138
Scott: yeah Don't want to be that guy.

922
01:03:53,661 --> 01:03:59,140
Rym: Of course that is a stepping stone, but I'll warn you it's very hard to step from that into a real position.

923
01:03:59,842 --> 01:04:02,189
Rym: It's much easier to step from a real position down to that.

924
01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:03,773
Scott: so step one get skills.

925
01:04:04,014 --> 01:04:06,120
Scott: step two display skills.

926
01:04:06,442 --> 01:04:11,170
Scott: Yes step three To actually do the work of getting jobs.

927
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:14,660
Scott: put that resume online in Craigslist and other places.

928
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:15,866
Rym: Yeah, dice comm is good.

929
01:04:15,906 --> 01:04:18,540
Rym: this changes frequently, so we can't really commit to anything.

930
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:20,258
Scott: Yeah, there are a bunch of sites out there.

931
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:21,023
Scott: Whatever.

932
01:04:21,063 --> 01:04:22,671
Rym: just don't underestimate Craigslist.

933
01:04:23,113 --> 01:04:27,791
Scott: Craigslist is how I got my job And it was actually the most productive job finding place there was.

934
01:04:27,891 --> 01:04:30,400
Rym: places like monster.com are generally useless.

935
01:04:30,561 --> 01:04:32,069
Scott: They're just a sea of ads and crap.

936
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:33,739
Scott: even dice is sort of like a sea of it.

937
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:36,272
Rym: I mean basically real like the big.

938
01:04:36,453 --> 01:04:37,740
Rym: Oh find jobs through our sites.

939
01:04:38,222 --> 01:04:45,271
Rym: The only people who look at those sites are HR corporate drones who have no idea who they're trying to hire Mm-hmm people who are smart who want to hire techies.

940
01:04:45,291 --> 01:04:46,999
Rym: look on Craigslist for like the cool, dude.

941
01:04:47,542 --> 01:04:51,680
Scott: Another people that can help you are people whose job it is to hire people.

942
01:04:51,882 --> 01:04:53,379
Scott: They're a lot of headhunter types.

943
01:04:53,863 --> 01:04:58,390
Scott: Now you got to be a little careful with them because they're basically trying to hire Anyone just because they get money.

944
01:04:58,450 --> 01:05:07,038
Rym: if they find someone at the same time They don't want to put someone who sucks into a job because then they lose their reputation like oh That's the guy who gave us a shit, dude.

945
01:05:07,581 --> 01:05:13,680
Scott: So the the rule I take with them is as long as they don't want any money from you fine go along with whatever.

946
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:15,066
Scott: They say you don't have to take any job.

947
01:05:15,086 --> 01:05:18,080
Rym: You don't want to yeah, and they might charge the employer a fee.

948
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:23,108
Rym: But the employer is happy with that because actually an IT at least That's where most of the jobs are going.

949
01:05:23,429 --> 01:05:26,140
Rym: very few companies know how to hire an IT guy.

950
01:05:26,722 --> 01:05:30,237
Rym: So they hire a recruiter and say find us someone who can do this job.

951
01:05:30,278 --> 01:05:37,473
Rym: We trust you Mm-hmm, and that's how almost every job I've courted over the past few months has found out about me or forwarded me.

952
01:05:37,794 --> 01:05:40,386
Rym: some guy says I was hired to find someone to Fill this job.

953
01:05:40,649 --> 01:05:41,274
Rym: You look good.

954
01:05:41,335 --> 01:05:42,176
Rym: Let's talk Yep.

955
01:05:42,541 --> 01:05:47,034
Scott: And lastly a lot of companies is the bigger the more likely they are to have this.

956
01:05:47,235 --> 01:05:49,923
Scott: they have actual like Databases.

957
01:05:49,983 --> 01:05:55,220
Scott: they have of resumes and when they want to hire people they'll search their own personal resume database.

958
01:05:55,341 --> 01:05:56,559
Scott: So you want to you know?

959
01:05:56,700 --> 01:06:02,140
Scott: There's a chance that you might come up when someone at a company is searching for some skill set that you have.

960
01:06:02,641 --> 01:06:07,895
Scott: So submit your resumes directly to companies through their websites and many companies you'll.

961
01:06:07,915 --> 01:06:11,209
Rym: they'll say like, oh, we're not going to hire you But we'll keep your resume around.

962
01:06:11,591 --> 01:06:12,135
Scott: they really do.

963
01:06:12,235 --> 01:06:12,960
Rym: Yeah, they're not lying.

964
01:06:13,241 --> 01:06:15,391
Rym: That's part of how I got again that IBM job.

965
01:06:15,411 --> 01:06:30,580
Rym: because I was offered a job That I turned down because I admitted that the job he described to me was not the same as the job I read on the job description and I told him flat-out It's not something I could do because I thought it was a networking job and it was a network coding job.

966
01:06:31,083 --> 01:06:32,833
Rym: I'm not a great coder and I admitted straight up.

967
01:06:32,893 --> 01:06:33,859
Rym: I can't code that for you.

968
01:06:34,322 --> 01:06:35,651
Rym: I could but it'd be subpar.

969
01:06:36,014 --> 01:06:36,558
Rym: don't hire me.

970
01:06:36,578 --> 01:06:41,336
Rym: and He gave my resume to someone else who then did hire me for a different job that I wanted.

971
01:06:42,099 --> 01:06:48,265
Rym: Yep Now along the same lines if you work for a company Do good work.

972
01:06:48,967 --> 01:06:55,611
Rym: And if your managers or people in your company like you or notice you They'll tell if you're looking for a job in the future.

973
01:06:55,651 --> 01:06:57,660
Rym: They'll tell their friend who works in the other company.

974
01:06:58,264 --> 01:06:59,836
Rym: Hey, I got a guy who's leaving my company.

975
01:06:59,877 --> 01:07:00,300
Rym: He's good.

976
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:05,166
Scott: Yep Yeah, the once again networking.

977
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:10,420
Rym: I hate to sound like those counselors but Network Network Network talk to people make friends in the industry.

978
01:07:10,481 --> 01:07:12,378
Rym: That's the only way to remain employed.

979
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:19,600
Scott: One other thing is if you go to a company with your resume Like let's say I go to Joe Corp and I say hey Joe Corp hire me.

980
01:07:20,142 --> 01:07:27,913
Scott: That stands out that Joe Corp a lot more than some guy on monster because that means I'm interested in them Like I you know, it's like oh this guy came to us.

981
01:07:28,255 --> 01:07:29,440
Scott: He wants us specifically.

982
01:07:29,581 --> 01:07:33,074
Scott: Yep, even though they probably know that you're going up to a whole bunch of companies.

983
01:07:33,395 --> 01:07:34,318
Scott: It's still better.

984
01:07:34,359 --> 01:07:38,752
Rym: now Don't try to be clever like the dude who spammed his resume out.

985
01:07:38,832 --> 01:07:45,494
Rym: Well, though sometimes it's good to be clever If you're not sure if you're being clever or not, you're not and don't do it.

986
01:07:46,036 --> 01:07:47,240
Scott: All right, here's an example.

987
01:07:47,543 --> 01:07:49,440
Scott: Let's give an example a good clever and bad clever.

988
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:54,714
Rym: All right Bad clever the dude who literally hired a spamming company and spammed his resume to.

989
01:07:54,735 --> 01:07:57,671
Rym: like every recruiter in the world He is good clever.

990
01:07:58,094 --> 01:08:08,408
Scott: There's a girl I think she does from RIT because I read it in some RIT Publication who wanted to work at eBay and she found this like perfect job Description at eBay and she basically made it.

991
01:08:08,528 --> 01:08:12,700
Scott: she bought a toolbox from Home Depot and all little compartments of the toolbox.

992
01:08:13,122 --> 01:08:20,660
Scott: she put a little thing to like symbolize the skill she had and the Skill was good for the job and how it was exactly all the things on the job description.

993
01:08:21,282 --> 01:08:28,040
Scott: So she went into eBay like into the building and she like went up to the desk and was like Can you give this to the you know?

994
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:31,219
Scott: She knew the guy who was hiring for the job and was like give this to that guy.

995
01:08:31,983 --> 01:08:32,526
Scott: And you know like.

996
01:08:32,586 --> 01:08:40,600
Scott: it was like this little toolbox resume thing that was you know She custom made a thing for the one specific job that matched her exactly.

997
01:08:41,042 --> 01:08:43,979
Scott: And of course this guy gets his toolbox on his desk and he opens it.

998
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:52,412
Scott: He sees all little things and it says the girl's name and her phone number and the thing matches the job description And you get a job guaranteed pretty much.

999
01:08:52,874 --> 01:08:54,160
Rym: All right bad.

1000
01:08:54,560 --> 01:09:01,115
Rym: Sneaking into a company finding the president barging into his office and saying I'm the man for the job I mean slapping your resume on his desk.

1001
01:09:01,194 --> 01:09:01,779
Scott: Yes, not a good.

1002
01:09:02,421 --> 01:09:03,325
Scott: He was also bad.

1003
01:09:03,425 --> 01:09:11,640
Scott: calling like, you know when you call a place to to get a job You want to call him more than once, you know, you call him once to investigate.

1004
01:09:12,082 --> 01:09:14,272
Scott: You call him once to do the actual deal.

1005
01:09:14,292 --> 01:09:15,919
Scott: you do the actual deal.

1006
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:20,310
Scott: You can call one more time to say like thank you or whatever Calling more than that.

1007
01:09:20,330 --> 01:09:21,779
Scott: You think you can get annoying.

1008
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:27,675
Scott: Yep, don't be the annoying guy But do call if like you have a legitimate question.

1009
01:09:27,694 --> 01:09:28,419
Scott: Just call him and ask.

1010
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:30,464
Rym: Now good.

1011
01:09:30,906 --> 01:09:33,960
Rym: Once again putting like interesting hobbies or things on your resume.

1012
01:09:34,782 --> 01:09:37,819
Rym: I mean, I know I've talked a lot about how I used to run the RIT anime club.

1013
01:09:38,624 --> 01:09:39,671
Rym: I put that on my resume.

1014
01:09:39,691 --> 01:09:41,140
Rym: It's been on my resume for a long time.

1015
01:09:41,502 --> 01:09:44,740
Rym: I listed right up there with IBM and RIT and you know what?

1016
01:09:44,899 --> 01:09:47,799
Rym: I always get asked about it and people are always very impressed with it.

1017
01:09:48,423 --> 01:09:54,833
Rym: If you ran like a big club or something in college Or you did something big through a fraternity put it on the resume.

1018
01:09:55,154 --> 01:09:56,700
Rym: anything that involves public speaking.

1019
01:09:57,481 --> 01:10:01,300
Rym: Actual leadership skills as in you are responsible for a large number of people.

1020
01:10:02,081 --> 01:10:04,870
Rym: Anything like that is gold because very few people have those skills.

1021
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:05,493
Scott: Here's an idea.

1022
01:10:05,533 --> 01:10:06,295
Scott: do things like that.

1023
01:10:06,315 --> 01:10:11,072
Scott: Yeah Don't be just that, you know, the normal schmuck who does nothing.

1024
01:10:11,494 --> 01:10:12,840
Scott: go be that go be somebody.

1025
01:10:13,121 --> 01:10:13,322
Scott: Yeah,

1026
01:10:13,402 --> 01:10:13,623
Rym: like if

1027
01:10:13,643 --> 01:10:14,466
Scott: you nobody's fool

1028
01:10:14,827 --> 01:10:25,960
Rym: like when we refreshment we got to RIT and we're sitting at the anime club And we all knew each other and we're all sitting there and we always had this idea like wow Those guys at the front of the room like they run everything how they get where they are.

1029
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:28,084
Rym: And then we thought one day.

1030
01:10:28,185 --> 01:10:30,694
Rym: Why don't we just take over and be them?

1031
01:10:30,714 --> 01:10:31,597
Scott: Oh, we did.

1032
01:10:31,677 --> 01:10:32,360
Rym: Yeah, we then we did.

1033
01:10:33,221 --> 01:10:34,467
Rym: Don't be the guy who always thinks.

1034
01:10:34,487 --> 01:10:35,532
Rym: Oh, I wish I could be that guy.

1035
01:10:35,552 --> 01:10:36,316
Rym: Just go be that guy.

1036
01:10:36,658 --> 01:10:38,482
Scott: Yeah All right.

1037
01:10:38,502 --> 01:10:40,026
Scott: So you got the skills.

1038
01:10:40,227 --> 01:10:41,511
Scott: you showed off the skills.

1039
01:10:41,892 --> 01:10:46,404
Scott: you let people know that you're showing off the skills You go to the interview.

1040
01:10:46,424 --> 01:10:48,612
Scott: You just act like a normal person.

1041
01:10:48,833 --> 01:10:52,426
Scott: Don't be all nervous because if you're all nervous They'll be like you're a gibbering fool.

1042
01:10:52,527 --> 01:10:55,980
Rym: Yeah at the same time don't like be polite and don't be arrogant.

1043
01:10:56,121 --> 01:11:00,260
Scott: And yes, you want to be confident, but just below arrogant because if you're arrogant they go.

1044
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,629
Scott: This is some know-it-all asshole.

1045
01:11:01,810 --> 01:11:13,659
Rym: Yeah, but you really you really need some Empathy skills at this point because I recently I went to an interview where I went through four different people And I had to sit with each one of them for a half hour like the HR guy like the head IT

1046
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:15,061
Scott: guy I hate those ones I love

1047
01:11:15,102 --> 01:11:27,356
Rym: those the normal IT guy and then like someone else and that sort of thing and Every one of these people was very different and you kind of have to play off of them Like some guys will be very dour and like rah

1048
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:27,677
Scott: rah

1049
01:11:27,718 --> 01:11:28,160
Rym: rah rah blah.

1050
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:29,358
Rym: You don't want to make a joke to that guy.

1051
01:11:30,103 --> 01:11:35,029
Rym: But then there's the guy who looks at your resume and then he laughs and talks about like yeah I knew a guy who worked at that company.

1052
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:35,613
Rym: Haha.

1053
01:11:35,673 --> 01:11:39,852
Rym: You can make a joke with him Mm-hmm read the person you're with and react accordingly.

1054
01:11:40,294 --> 01:11:41,780
Rym: Don't crack inappropriate jokes.

1055
01:11:43,381 --> 01:11:47,399
Scott: You don't have anything that would get you fired normally because you just won't be hired.

1056
01:11:49,641 --> 01:11:52,079
Scott: Don't ask the hot chick interviewing you out on a date.

1057
01:11:53,053 --> 01:11:59,220
Rym: Yeah Unless she is obviously flirting with you in which case that'll probably get you starts playing footsie with you.

1058
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:01,868
Scott: Then you're hired anyway, so just say whatever you want.

1059
01:12:01,908 --> 01:12:02,128
Scott: Yeah.

1060
01:12:02,850 --> 01:12:10,660
Rym: Now the only other thing I'll really say is don't underestimate yourself Don't overestimate yourself, but definitely don't correctly estimate yourself.

1061
01:12:11,163 --> 01:12:24,060
Rym: but because this I got hit with this when I was starting to leave RIT and getting out of the real workforce and I was looking at jobs and I was thinking like I Don't have those skills they want like five years of experience in blood.

1062
01:12:24,801 --> 01:12:25,445
Rym: What if I'm not?

1063
01:12:25,887 --> 01:12:27,355
Rym: I don't know what I'm am.

1064
01:12:27,395 --> 01:12:28,280
Rym: I really qualified.

1065
01:12:28,467 --> 01:12:31,518
Rym: I mean I don't feel like I know so much about this stuff.

1066
01:12:31,539 --> 01:12:32,662
Rym: and Then I like.

1067
01:12:32,743 --> 01:12:37,465
Rym: and then I got hired by IBM and I showed up and I sat down my off and I was like Am I in over my head?

1068
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:39,270
Rym: Can I really do all this crap?

1069
01:12:39,993 --> 01:12:43,447
Rym: And then they gave me a sign was like, oh wow Yeah, I know all this stuff.

1070
01:12:43,467 --> 01:12:44,957
Rym: This is exactly what I did in school.

1071
01:12:44,997 --> 01:12:45,500
Rym: I'm badass.

1072
01:12:45,882 --> 01:12:48,540
Rym: Yep, don't don't be afraid of a job.

1073
01:12:48,841 --> 01:12:53,600
Rym: The job will always be easier than you think it will be unless you lied to get hired and then you're screwed.

1074
01:12:54,840 --> 01:13:07,560
Scott: Yeah, I noticed a lot of times when you look at jobs and you see the requirements and a lot of times online Employers are forced to write things like we need someone with five years in this and four years in that and one year in this.

1075
01:13:07,681 --> 01:13:18,002
Scott: And if you had this it would be good to don't take that So literally, you know Like I used to take it real literally and not apply to things because I had four years and not five years Experiences.

1076
01:13:18,042 --> 01:13:21,914
Rym: now I apply to jobs where I very specifically don't have one of the things they say.

1077
01:13:21,934 --> 01:13:23,820
Scott: Yeah, just apply anyway.

1078
01:13:24,041 --> 01:13:28,020
Scott: What's the worst they can do just ignore you which is what they would do anyway, if you didn't apply at all.

1079
01:13:28,201 --> 01:13:31,152
Rym: Yeah, and in fact, they'll usually think well he applied anyway, let's talk to him.

1080
01:13:31,513 --> 01:13:33,139
Rym: Yeah, so you said you don't know PHP.

1081
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:37,720
Rym: You're like, yeah, but I started learning it just now because I'm interested in this job.

1082
01:13:37,921 --> 01:13:46,750
Scott: Yeah, I'll apply to any programming job I will apply to as long as I know the concepts behind the variety of programming they want because I can learn a programming language in a week.

1083
01:13:47,053 --> 01:13:53,894
Scott: In fact, I did as James When I work for him, I learned to do language like boop because I had to.

1084
01:13:53,914 --> 01:13:55,139
Scott: I could just learn him.

1085
01:13:55,722 --> 01:13:57,860
Rym: Yeah, like one job I was looking at they needed J boss.

1086
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:05,952
Rym: So I pulled up all the books and I read the basics of how to run J boss and if I'd actually gotten hired I probably would have sat down for a week and fully learn J boss.

1087
01:14:06,254 --> 01:14:08,868
Rym: Yeah, I didn't really I did Didn't go with that job.

1088
01:14:08,888 --> 01:14:10,560
Rym: So I didn't bother because I don't like J boss.

1089
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:17,546
Scott: But yeah, you go buy a book you go online read documentation and bam you got yourself One more thing on your resume.

1090
01:14:18,048 --> 01:14:21,020
Scott: now we could go on but I think we've gone on quite a bit.

1091
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:27,509
Rym: I think we'll split this into another show because I think there's another show we could definitely do on How the corporate world actually works.

1092
01:14:28,132 --> 01:14:29,739
Scott: I'm not in the corporate world so much.

1093
01:14:29,819 --> 01:14:31,502
Scott: I'm more Corporate world.

1094
01:14:31,623 --> 01:14:36,077
Rym: I am in like the enterprise exactly like you read in comics and books and see on TV.

1095
01:14:36,157 --> 01:14:38,125
Rym: corporate world Dilbert world.

1096
01:14:38,205 --> 01:14:39,270
Rym: Yeah, I'm in the Dilbert world.

1097
01:14:39,772 --> 01:14:41,340
Scott: Uh, you know, I don't really go in the Dilbert world.

1098
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:43,239
Scott: So yeah, I'm in the sub Dilbert world.

1099
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:53,812
Rym: We're both in the working world and all I have to say is that jobs The vast majority of people who have jobs in this country at least white-collar jobs Do so little work.

1100
01:14:54,214 --> 01:14:56,542
Rym: It's amazing It's true.

1101
01:14:56,643 --> 01:14:58,510
Rym: People really aren't efficient at all.

1102
01:14:58,792 --> 01:15:00,780
Rym: And if everyone was efficient, we could all go home early.

1103
01:15:01,501 --> 01:15:03,612
Scott: Yeah, it's like or we could do more.

1104
01:15:03,632 --> 01:15:12,226
Rym: Yeah, we don't want to talk about this now We've gone on forever, but we'll do another show where I guess we're going to reveal these secrets of the real world Outside of college and how.

1105
01:15:12,286 --> 01:15:14,354
Rym: it's not nearly as difficult as you think.

1106
01:15:14,776 --> 01:15:15,740
Scott: Oh one more thing.

1107
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:20,379
Scott: So in case you know, you're still deluded by school because you're rather young.

1108
01:15:20,841 --> 01:15:25,034
Scott: Guess what your grades in elementary and middle school don't mean shit.

1109
01:15:25,154 --> 01:15:27,160
Rym: In fact your grades in high school don't mean shit.

1110
01:15:27,329 --> 01:15:31,620
Scott: Yeah The only thing your grades in high school mean is will you get into Harvard or not?

1111
01:15:31,841 --> 01:15:35,660
Scott: Unless you're going for Harvard or an Ivy League school your grades in high school don't mean shit.

1112
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:36,062
Scott: No one can.

1113
01:15:36,082 --> 01:15:42,307
Rym: and even then if you're smart your grades still won't matter because they'll see like oh you got all C's Oh, but he took all AP classes.

1114
01:15:42,749 --> 01:15:44,335
Rym: Oh, look, he was the head of the band.

1115
01:15:44,676 --> 01:15:50,360
Scott: Oh, alright, he's smart Yep, and then in college your grades really don't mean shit as long as you get the piece of paper.

1116
01:15:50,621 --> 01:15:56,862
Scott: Oh and unless you want to work for the big corporation that actually cares and so it's unless you aim for the top the number Doesn't matter.

1117
01:15:56,943 --> 01:16:00,296
Rym: and all I want to say the big corporation is not all it's cracked up to be.

1118
01:16:00,417 --> 01:16:01,802
Scott: don't work for the big Corporation.

1119
01:16:01,862 --> 01:16:02,604
Scott: Oh my god.

1120
01:16:02,625 --> 01:16:05,695
Scott: Yeah work for the smart cool guy with a small business.

1121
01:16:06,036 --> 01:16:06,859
Rym: You should hear.

1122
01:16:06,879 --> 01:16:11,500
Rym: so I mean, I can't tell a lot of these stories of what I've gone through in the corporate world.

1123
01:16:11,661 --> 01:16:14,298
Scott: See if you didn't live in the corporate world, you could tell all your stories.

1124
01:16:14,479 --> 01:16:18,499
Rym: Yeah Well, I mean there are various non-disclosure agreements and such and some stories I can never tell.

1125
01:16:18,901 --> 01:16:24,075
Rym: However, I can tell similar stories or I can tell stories that have the same moral.

1126
01:16:24,737 --> 01:16:27,478
Scott: So this guy Joey Jojo Shabbadoo.

1127
01:16:28,521 --> 01:16:33,738
Rym: So, I guess in closing I just realized that this little toad in my diorama is totally flipping me off.

1128
01:16:34,239 --> 01:16:37,778
Scott: what Awesome double deuce.

1129
01:16:40,741 --> 01:16:41,462
