1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,481
Scott: It's Tuesday, April 25th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:12,943 --> 00:00:16,135
Scott: Tonight, we talk about the amazing board game, Kalus.

3
00:00:17,534 --> 00:00:17,866
Scott: Kalus.

4
00:00:19,132 --> 00:00:20,169
Scott: Let's do this!

5
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:25,150
Rym: So now that it's spring, I'm actually really seriously looking into buying a motorcycle.

6
00:00:26,274 --> 00:00:26,650
Scott: Oh, really?

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:40,829
Rym: Yeah, considering that most of the jobs I've been looking at either aren't actually easily commutable to buy a train, or for various reasons I would need my car there, I really think in general it'd be nice to have a motorcycle to get to work every day.

8
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,205
Scott: Yeah, unless, you know, the weather's bad, or you die.

9
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:58,130
Rym: Yeah, I mean my dad used to motorcycle a lot, and Emily's sister likes motorcycles, and honestly I'm not too, I don't know, full of ego to go to class and ask for help because I have no idea how to ride a motorcycle.

10
00:00:59,211 --> 00:01:00,810
Rym: I'll be taking all the relevant classes.

11
00:01:02,031 --> 00:01:05,750
Rym: Of course, but wearing all of the relevant armors on my bits.

12
00:01:07,092 --> 00:01:30,210
Scott: Yeah, but even people with much skill in motorcycle, you know, it's like the number of motorcycle accidents when you look at, like, you know, it's always this sketchy thing when people argue about this, like, oh, they're dangerous or not dangerous, because you look at it, and it seems to be the total number of motorcycle accidents is much rarer than car accidents, but also motorcycles are much rarer than cars.

13
00:01:30,932 --> 00:01:32,070
Rym: Yeah, I'm not too worried.

14
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:40,150
Rym: I mean, I guess in the end it would be so much cheaper than driving with the gas prices, what they are, that it's worth the tiny risk to my life.

15
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:48,400
Scott: Yeah, but the thing is when there's a motorcycle accident, it's like, oh no, it's, but when there's a car accident, it's like, most, some of the time, you're just like, eh, whatever.

16
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:52,270
Scott: Even, you know, you're alive, but the car, that's another story.

17
00:01:52,572 --> 00:01:52,683
Rym: Yeah.

18
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,898
Scott: I mean, they said there was a meeting in the city.

19
00:01:54,938 --> 00:02:00,570
Scott: I was actually gonna get work to do, and right before I got on the train, email, oh, no meeting.

20
00:02:01,131 --> 00:02:02,470
Rym: So why'd you even get on the train?

21
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:10,210
Scott: Because I had this new hard drive for my work laptop, and I went to the city, because then I could get the Windows CDs and all that jazz.

22
00:02:10,971 --> 00:02:12,569
Rym: You know, I could have just given you a Windows CD.

23
00:02:13,331 --> 00:02:15,646
Scott: Yeah, get one for my work, because it's my work's laptop.

24
00:02:15,686 --> 00:02:16,189
Scott: I'm not gonna use...

25
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:17,352
Rym: Why not?

26
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,396
Rym: The CD is a CD.

27
00:02:18,436 --> 00:02:22,030
Rym: What matters is the key, which you can get from your current legal installation from work.

28
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,376
Scott: Oh, okay, hold on.

29
00:02:23,457 --> 00:02:25,007
Scott: There's a key on the bottom of this laptop.

30
00:02:25,047 --> 00:02:25,409
Scott: You see that?

31
00:02:25,716 --> 00:02:25,950
Rym: Yeah.

32
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:26,868
Scott: Doesn't fucking work.

33
00:02:27,832 --> 00:02:29,690
Rym: Um, is it for the right version of the operating system?

34
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,202
Scott: It says right on there, Windows XP Professional.

35
00:02:32,464 --> 00:02:33,589
Rym: One or two, two to you.

36
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,870
Rym: Are you sure it's not a bulk or OEM license that sometimes does require a different CD?

37
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:38,927
Scott: I have a feeling it is.

38
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,117
Rym: Well, good job.

39
00:02:40,157 --> 00:02:41,208
Rym: I could have gotten you that CD, too.

40
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:47,630
Scott: Doesn't matter, 'cause I needed some other work softwares, which I don't have.

41
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:48,876
Rym: Alright, good game.

42
00:02:48,896 --> 00:02:50,689
Rym: So you went down to the city to pick up a CD.

43
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,930
Scott: Well, and also, I'd just like to say that Windows sucks ass.

44
00:02:56,091 --> 00:02:59,849
Scott: Anyone who still thinks, like, "Okay, what does Windows have going for

45
00:02:59,890 --> 00:02:59,930
Scott: it?".

46
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:00,348
Scott: Gaming.

47
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,750
Scott: Well, that, and it has a bajillion drivers for all the hardware in the universe, right?

48
00:03:05,751 --> 00:03:10,830
Rym: Uh, also support for, uh, this little bit that I bought to recorded cons that doesn't work in Linux.

49
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,359
Scott: That's not something going for Windows.

50
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:13,770
Scott: That's something against that little bit.

51
00:03:14,391 --> 00:03:19,770
Rym: Yeah, I point out that there's no such thing as a little bit like this that works in Linux, as far as I know.

52
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:20,495
Scott: There are.

53
00:03:20,515 --> 00:03:21,468
Scott: They're just, uh, you know...

54
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,069
Rym: Expensive.

55
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:24,883
Scott: 'Cause, you know, quality.

56
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:24,984
Scott: Yeah.

57
00:03:26,195 --> 00:03:26,358
Rym: Anyway.

58
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:26,870
Rym: Besides gaming.

59
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,291
Scott: Whatever.

60
00:03:28,492 --> 00:03:32,325
Scott: The point is, is that people are always like, "Oh, it's really hard to get Linux to work on a laptop.

61
00:03:32,385 --> 00:03:33,288
Scott: It doesn't support all this

62
00:03:33,308 --> 00:03:33,509
Scott: stuff."

63
00:03:34,475 --> 00:03:35,826
Scott: And, "Oh, Windows just works great on

64
00:03:35,887 --> 00:03:36,250
Scott: laptops.".

65
00:03:36,391 --> 00:03:41,290
Scott: Well, I tried to install Windows on a laptop today, and it didn't have a goddamn driver.

66
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,063
Scott: Didn't have a driver for the network card.

67
00:03:43,103 --> 00:03:43,909
Scott: I had to go get it.

68
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:44,734
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

69
00:03:44,775 --> 00:03:52,630
Rym: I'll point out that you have an IBM ThinkPad, and usually when they install the OS on an IBM ThinkPad, they install it from the recovery disk, and it comes with everything already.

70
00:03:53,532 --> 00:03:55,129
Scott: Yeah, well, screw that.

71
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,765
Rym: Yeah, well, that's what you get for using Windows.

72
00:03:57,825 --> 00:03:58,529
Rym: It's not my problem.

73
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,382
Scott: I'm just, you know, it's not me that wants to use Windows.

74
00:04:01,402 --> 00:04:02,930
Scott: It's the work that forces me to use it.

75
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,990
Scott: Part of the reason I got the bigger hard drive is so I can throw some other OSes on the other area.

76
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,490
Rym: Wait, so, uh, why does the work force you to use the Windows?

77
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:11,849
Scott: Because the work isn't so smart.

78
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:19,089
Rym: So, uh, there's the work has a... So there's some applications that, uh, you need to use Windows for, and thus that's another...

79
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:19,735
Scott: None that I do!

80
00:04:19,755 --> 00:04:21,490
Scott: I don't know how to use shit.

81
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,578
Rym: Well, apparently you have to.

82
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,090
Rym: Otherwise, you wouldn't need Windows.

83
00:04:24,534 --> 00:04:25,360
Scott: I don't need to use shit.

84
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,530
Scott: They need to use Windows.

85
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,830
Scott: They want to be able to, you know, do their Windows thing to my computer.

86
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,970
Rym: All right, so then as a result, you have to use Windows in order to have a job.

87
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,030
Scott: Well, it's my work's computers, not my computer.

88
00:04:37,371 --> 00:04:38,069
Rym: All right, all right.

89
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:38,989
Scott: But it sucks.

90
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:43,090
Rym: Because you realize most people who use Windows are forced to use Windows for various reasons.

91
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:54,510
Scott: Yeah, but the point I'm making here is that, you know, one of the things that is often touted is the, you know, good part of using Windows is that all the hardware is easily supported and such.

92
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:55,941
Scott: Uh, it's not true.

93
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:56,630
Scott: It's just a bunch of shit.

94
00:04:57,111 --> 00:05:01,530
Scott: I could put a live CD from any Linux distribution in here and it just works.

95
00:05:01,991 --> 00:05:02,344
Rym: God damn.

96
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,689
Rym: Uh, on a lot of laptops that isn't the case, and a lot of times the wireless won't work.

97
00:05:06,231 --> 00:05:07,349
Scott: Yeah, those laptops suck.

98
00:05:08,371 --> 00:05:09,850
Rym: Yeah, you seem to think everything sucks.

99
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,141
Scott: Yeah, everything does.

100
00:05:11,161 --> 00:05:11,849
Scott: Most things suck.

101
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,899
Rym: Nah, I take a more optimistic approach.

102
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:15,990
Rym: Only many things suck, not most things.

103
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,888
Scott: Most things suck.

104
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:17,374
Scott: Nah.

105
00:05:17,993 --> 00:05:18,275
Scott: Meh.

106
00:05:18,981 --> 00:05:19,949
Scott: Yeah, most things suck.

107
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:20,830
Rym: Eh, puppies.

108
00:05:21,592 --> 00:05:21,988
Scott: They suck.

109
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:22,907
Rym: What's wrong with you?

110
00:05:24,232 --> 00:05:24,550
Rym: Uh, Firefly.

111
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:25,988
Scott: Serenity.

112
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:26,434
Scott: Sucks.

113
00:05:26,515 --> 00:05:27,428
Scott: It's the same damn thing.

114
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,030
Rym: No, no, Serenity was the movie.

115
00:05:30,111 --> 00:05:30,638
Scott: Whatever.

116
00:05:30,658 --> 00:05:31,650
Scott: It's the same shit.

117
00:05:32,434 --> 00:05:32,870
Rym: Star Trek.

118
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:34,029
Scott: All of it sucks.

119
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,049
Rym: Star Trek's awesome.

120
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:35,586
Scott: It sucks.

121
00:05:36,271 --> 00:05:37,430
Rym: What about, uh, Star Wars?

122
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:38,589
Scott: Doesn't suck.

123
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:39,529
Rym: Episode one.

124
00:05:39,912 --> 00:05:40,065
Scott: Sucks.

125
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:40,650
Scott: Okay.

126
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:44,023
Rym: Anyway, uh, all right, E.T.

127
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,430
Rym: the extraterrestrial, the movie.

128
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:46,190
Scott: Awesome.

129
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,027
Rym: The game.

130
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:49,910
Scott: It's not the worst thing ever.

131
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:51,228
Rym: Um, yes it is.

132
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,070
Scott: No, it's not.

133
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,147
Rym: I submit that Custer's Revenge had more redeeming gameplay than

134
00:05:55,228 --> 00:05:55,348
Rym: E.T.,

135
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,790
Rym: the extraterrestrial for the Atari 2600.

136
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,484
Scott: I don't know about that, but I do know that E.T.

137
00:06:00,725 --> 00:06:11,750
Rym: for the 2600, while there was a big fiasco surrounding it of cartridges in a dump- You pilot a blob into pits to pick up other blobs that you then return to a larger blob.

138
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:16,189
Rym: The control scheme consists of hitting a button repeatedly and hoping something happens.

139
00:06:17,074 --> 00:06:18,349
Scott: Isn't that most games?

140
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,247
Scott: Yes, it is.

141
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,989
Rym: Custer's Revenge had more redeeming gameplay.

142
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,790
Rym: It was also more straightforward.

143
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,369
Rym: You had to dodge those arrows and do your thing.

144
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,990
Rym: None of this falling in pits, FBI agents dragging your ass around.

145
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,007
Scott: Yes, there was more to it in E.T No, there wasn't.

146
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,529
Rym: Fall in a pit.

147
00:06:36,953 --> 00:06:37,325
Rym: Nothing here.

148
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:38,469
Rym: Fly out.

149
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,529
Rym: Fall in another pit.

150
00:06:39,772 --> 00:06:40,530
Rym: Oh, a dead flower.

151
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:41,629
Rym: I bring it back to life.

152
00:06:42,073 --> 00:06:42,549
Rym: Fall in a pit.

153
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:43,229
Rym: Oh, a blob.

154
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:43,866
Rym: I'll touch it.

155
00:06:44,351 --> 00:06:45,629
Rym: Oh, now I have a status thing.

156
00:06:45,852 --> 00:06:47,229
Rym: Oh, the G-Man came and took it away.

157
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,019
Scott: Yep.

158
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:49,015
Rym: Yeah.

159
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:55,610
Rym: Anyway, in video game news, we all remember Infineon, who- or Infinium.

160
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,149
Rym: Not Infineon, Infinium.

161
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,350
Scott: Infineon makes chips.

162
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:58,536
Scott: Yeah.

163
00:06:59,355 --> 00:07:00,089
Scott: And they have a racetrack.

164
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:09,930
Rym: Infinium made- well, said they made the Phantom Gaming Console, which was supposed to be a competitor to the PS2 and the GameCube and the Xbox.

165
00:07:11,241 --> 00:07:14,990
Rym: It was also supposed to be a competitor to every console ever.

166
00:07:15,271 --> 00:07:19,450
Rym: It was supposed to be- basically, it was touted as the most awesome, amazing, perfect console ever.

167
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,170
Rym: It'll bring a revolution to the gaming industry.

168
00:07:21,251 --> 00:07:22,449
Rym: It'll be everything you could ever hope for.

169
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,390
Scott: I thought they were just saying it was going to be a console that played PC games.

170
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,030
Scott: I thought that's what they were saying.

171
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:31,530
Rym: Well, at first, but they kept getting more and more like, "This is big.

172
00:07:32,296 --> 00:07:33,510
Rym: Ooh, it can do this.

173
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:33,922
Rym: It can do

174
00:07:33,943 --> 00:07:34,068
Rym: this.".

175
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:42,290
Rym: The specs they- when they announced it, the specs they gave, which were very vague, were well beyond what you could afford to put into a little console.

176
00:07:43,893 --> 00:07:46,410
Rym: And regardless, they never actually made the Phantom Console.

177
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:53,089
Rym: They faced bankruptcy, and there was all sorts of shenanigans going on with the fact that the company really kind of didn't actually exist.

178
00:07:54,711 --> 00:08:00,470
Rym: Well, then they straightened themselves out, and they claimed to have a real product, the Phantom Latboard.

179
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:04,670
Rym: Now, I note that the console, the one that never existed, was called the Phantom.

180
00:08:05,691 --> 00:08:08,850
Rym: Now, this Latboard, which we've seen pictures of, is also called the Phantom.

181
00:08:09,676 --> 00:08:10,710
Rym: And it seems like a cool idea.

182
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:18,190
Rym: It's a little thing you put on your lap, and it has a keyboard in it and a spot for a mouse, and is basically a way to use a computer in the living room easily without a table.

183
00:08:18,991 --> 00:08:19,428
Rym: Cool idea.

184
00:08:20,931 --> 00:08:27,509
Rym: This was the only product this company has ever produced or claimed they were going to produce and had any evidence of having a prototype that I've ever seen.

185
00:08:28,652 --> 00:08:30,149
Rym: And, uh, things were going well.

186
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:36,409
Rym: Until it was announced, recently, that this product, like the Phantom Console, has now been mysteriously delayed.

187
00:08:37,652 --> 00:08:38,000
Scott: Mm-hmm.

188
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:38,852
Scott: Hmm.

189
00:08:40,432 --> 00:08:45,130
Scott: See, this is the only good thing to come out of the Phantom, was this cool little lap keyboard thing.

190
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:49,869
Scott: The fact that it's not coming is, uh, being sad, actually.

191
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,810
Rym: I submit that other things came out of the Phantom Console.

192
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:56,570
Rym: For one, about seven Penny Arcade comics that were hilarious.

193
00:08:57,712 --> 00:08:58,989
Rym: A media shitstorm.

194
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,367
Rym: Lots of lolling.

195
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:05,830
Scott: Yeah, that, you know, there's a lot of things like that that came out of Jack Thompson.

196
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,070
Scott: That doesn't mean I still wanted to be around.

197
00:09:08,293 --> 00:09:09,570
Rym: Oh, I want Jack Thompson to be around.

198
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,090
Rym: I can't wait for my next thing of the day to be Jack Thompson.

199
00:09:13,534 --> 00:09:14,929
Scott: Uh, I, I really can get it.

200
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:16,630
Scott: Uh, I've had enough with Jack.

201
00:09:16,732 --> 00:09:17,430
Rym: I don't know what next.

202
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,090
Rym: He'd have to sue me for me to talk about him again.

203
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,190
Rym: Maybe I'll start talking about the people over at Avinium.

204
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,070
Scott: Maybe, of course, uh, they really don't care.

205
00:09:27,674 --> 00:09:28,469
Scott: I mean, they're just done.

206
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,117
Rym: Yeah.

207
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:34,490
Scott: All right, so there's some rumors going around.

208
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,550
Rym: There's some rumors going around.

209
00:09:36,812 --> 00:09:39,250
Scott: First of all, on May 9th, write that on your calendar.

210
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:39,676
Scott: May 9th.

211
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:44,329
Scott: That's the date of the Nintendo Super Press Conference at E3.

212
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:57,661
Rym: Now, I'm not gonna try to sound like a Nintendo fanboy here, and I'd say there's a small chance that this is going to be one of those moments that years from now we'll remember, and fellow geeks will ask each other, "Where were you when it was

213
00:09:57,721 --> 00:09:58,227
Rym: announced?".

214
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:01,270
Scott: I don't think it'll be quite that amazing.

215
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,169
Rym: Hence, I gave some fairly meager odds on it.

216
00:10:04,394 --> 00:10:04,521
Rym: Yeah.

217
00:10:05,374 --> 00:10:06,469
Rym: It depends on what they announce.

218
00:10:08,312 --> 00:10:10,730
Rym: If it's just the rumor that you're about to tell me, I'm not so excited.

219
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:16,970
Scott: No, no, no, but on that day, they're going to basically give the full story on the revolution.

220
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,366
Scott: There will be nothing left hidden after May 9th.

221
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,690
Scott: That all will be out in the open.

222
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:27,190
Scott: Probably the release date, the price, the feature set, some launch titles.

223
00:10:27,391 --> 00:10:29,149
Scott: Everything will be way out in the open.

224
00:10:30,132 --> 00:10:30,858
Scott: And everyone will go,

225
00:10:30,939 --> 00:10:31,525
Scott: "Woo-hoo!".

226
00:10:32,371 --> 00:10:37,988
Rym: Meanwhile, Sony, whose PS3 was supposed to be released already, has nothing for E3.

227
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,049
Scott: Yeah, well, we're not worried about that right now.

228
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:53,009
Scott: What we're worried about is the latest rumor is that one of the things that we will learn about the revolution on May 9th could possibly be, according to sources...

229
00:10:55,012 --> 00:10:56,950
Rym: Wow, I think that was enough disclaimers.

230
00:10:57,092 --> 00:10:58,050
Rym: Yeah, okay.

231
00:10:59,433 --> 00:11:02,390
Scott: You know the little nunchuck thing attached to the revolution controller?

232
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,989
Rym: Has the little directional pad on it.

233
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,190
Scott: Has an analog stick on it.

234
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:06,386
Scott: Yeah.

235
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,285
Scott: And a button under it.

236
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,329
Scott: Or two buttons under it, or something like that.

237
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:15,570
Scott: You know, you don't have to use it with the revolution controller, but you should if you're going to play like a Metroid or something.

238
00:11:16,452 --> 00:11:18,089
Scott: You move with that and you aim with the other one.

239
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:22,990
Scott: Anyway, supposedly, that will also be motion sensitive.

240
00:11:23,111 --> 00:11:30,270
Scott: Not as motion sensitive as the revolution controller itself, but motion sensitive nonetheless, adding yet another axis of control.

241
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,429
Rym: So, uh, boxing games.

242
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,548
Rym: Drumming games.

243
00:11:35,852 --> 00:11:36,550
Rym: Boxing games.

244
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,089
Scott: Anything that requires two hands.

245
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,130
Scott: Two hands shooting.

246
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:40,311
Rym: Ah.

247
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:45,330
Scott: Um, throwing two knives.

248
00:11:45,793 --> 00:11:46,089
Rym: Oh yeah.

249
00:11:46,493 --> 00:11:46,726
Scott: Oh yeah.

250
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:54,190
Rym: Yeah, you know, I also heard a rumor that the revolution is going to have a holographic 3D projector, it will fetch your mail, and fell at you regularly.

251
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,098
Scott: Oh really?

252
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,510
Rym: Yeah, really.

253
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,069
Scott: I had to get me some of that.

254
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:01,548
Rym: Yeah, basically, there's a lot of rumors and we really can't say anything until E3.

255
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,729
Rym: Which, by the way, GeekNights is not going to.

256
00:12:05,051 --> 00:12:05,988
Rym: For a number of reasons.

257
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:08,688
Scott: We're not allowed in, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

258
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,007
Rym: Yeah, even though it's not hard to get into E3.

259
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,850
Scott: Supposedly they're making it harder this year.

260
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:14,186
Rym: Good.

261
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:15,608
Scott: We'll see what happens.

262
00:12:16,651 --> 00:12:18,190
Rym: Hey, maybe one of us will win that contest.

263
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:19,870
Scott: Yeah, that would be awesome.

264
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:36,140
Scott: So, anyone who calls themselves a worthwhile geek these days knows about the DDRs and the guitar heroes.

265
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,340
Rym: Dance Dance Revolution.

266
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,219
Scott: Yeah, not double data rate or anything else that DDR stands for, because it stands for a lot of shit.

267
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:53,260
Rym: Now, there's a guy named DJ 8-Ball, who back in the day was well known as one of the best awesome DDR freestyle Funkmaster dancers ever.

268
00:12:53,861 --> 00:12:54,878
Scott: Yeah, he was pretty good at DDR.

269
00:12:55,141 --> 00:13:00,320
Scott: I mean, he probably, I don't know if he was good enough to get super perfects on every song ever.

270
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,580
Rym: Well, no, he did the freestyle.

271
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,718
Scott: Yeah, but he could do DDR and look really cool while doing DDR.

272
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,800
Scott: Like, if you took away the pads, he'd be really dancing, for real.

273
00:13:11,481 --> 00:13:14,940
Rym: Well, this guy is reminiscent of that, except for one key difference.

274
00:13:15,602 --> 00:13:16,131
Scott: He has one leg.

275
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:17,718
Rym: Really?

276
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:18,460
Scott: Really.

277
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:30,259
Scott: So, this guy is up on this DDR machine doing a somewhat difficult song on a somewhat difficult setting, and he has two crutches and one leg, and he does it rather well.

278
00:13:31,162 --> 00:13:33,059
Rym: Yeah, the video is really kind of cool to see.

279
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:50,879
Scott: Like, most people who are missing a leg or something like that, you know, it's like most of them seem to just kind of get by, you know, and try to at least bring their lives back to what they would be if they didn't have a handicap.

280
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:55,998
Scott: But, you know, it's a rare guy like this that makes his life better than what it would be, you know.

281
00:13:56,321 --> 00:13:58,339
Rym: Well, at least his life in regards to DDR.

282
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,820
Scott: Well, it doesn't look like his life's too bad.

283
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,339
Scott: He looks like he can get around pretty good.

284
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:02,684
Rym: Eh?

285
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:03,411
Rym: Well.

286
00:14:04,005 --> 00:14:04,279
Scott: Well.

287
00:14:04,921 --> 00:14:05,124
Rym: Mr.

288
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,000
Rym: Perry would be pissed.

289
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,138
Rym: You're lucky he's not here.

290
00:14:07,621 --> 00:14:08,000
Scott: Whatever.

291
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:09,460
Rym: All right.

292
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,400
Scott: He could drown in a well for all I care.

293
00:14:12,062 --> 00:14:13,560
Rym: So, why not die in a fire?

294
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,539
Scott: Well, because I wanted to use the word well.

295
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,419
Rym: Yeah, but die in a fire is the thing.

296
00:14:17,721 --> 00:14:18,999
Rym: It's the thing going around.

297
00:14:19,784 --> 00:14:20,419
Scott: It's not well.

298
00:14:21,047 --> 00:14:21,175
Rym: Yeah.

299
00:14:22,287 --> 00:14:22,559
Rym: All right.

300
00:14:23,361 --> 00:14:37,576
Rym: So, so this has been making the rounds, but I want to talk about it, partly because some of my friends had a rather poor showing on it, and two, because it's something I can put in the forum and we can all have fun with it like we did with that nerd geek dork test a while ago.

301
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,200
Scott: Yeah, because there's two answers.

302
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,359
Scott: We don't know and we want someone to tell us what they are.

303
00:14:42,001 --> 00:14:47,899
Rym: It's a simple little 8-bit test where it shows you a sprite from an 8-bit Nintendo video game and you have to say what game it is.

304
00:14:48,924 --> 00:14:50,159
Rym: I got all but two of them.

305
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:59,280
Rym: Now, keep in mind that the rules in terms of us and GeekNights on a quiz like this is you can't think for more than like 10 seconds on one and you can't like Google it.

306
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,080
Rym: So, just right off the top of your head, which ones can you get?

307
00:15:02,483 --> 00:15:03,740
Rym: I think there's 10 of them on the list.

308
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,783
Rym: 10 or 12.

309
00:15:04,783 --> 00:15:05,420
Scott: Something like that.

310
00:15:06,563 --> 00:15:07,237
Rym: I got all but two.

311
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,700
Rym: Scott got all but I think five.

312
00:15:10,181 --> 00:15:11,240
Scott: I think it's almost like four.

313
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,340
Rym: Nah, you missed.

314
00:15:12,922 --> 00:15:14,020
Scott: Some of them I should have had.

315
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,679
Scott: It was bullshit.

316
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,920
Rym: Yeah, I should have had, but you know what?

317
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,459
Scott: I give myself half credit for those.

318
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:17,932
Scott: No.

319
00:15:18,744 --> 00:15:19,831
Scott: I get half credit on the Dr.

320
00:15:19,871 --> 00:15:20,938
Scott: Mario and the...

321
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,940
Rym: Well, don't say anything because that'll ruin it for the people out there who haven't done it yet.

322
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,415
Scott: They don't know which one's Dr.

323
00:15:26,476 --> 00:15:26,740
Scott: Mario.

324
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,694
Rym: It's obvious because there's only one of them.

325
00:15:28,735 --> 00:15:29,158
Rym: it could be.

326
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,160
Scott: No, because they're not old school.

327
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,140
Rym: Besides Scott, it's obvious.

328
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,040
Rym: Besides, even then, that's the one you didn't get.

329
00:15:36,987 --> 00:15:37,559
Scott: I knew it.

330
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,119
Scott: I just didn't know it.

331
00:15:39,243 --> 00:15:39,479
Rym: Whatever.

332
00:15:39,561 --> 00:15:40,060
Rym: We'll blow it away.

333
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,417
Rym: Scott didn't get the ninja from Final Fantasy I.

334
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:43,539
Scott: Oh, come on.

335
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,298
Scott: It was such a trick.

336
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,199
Rym: No, it wasn't.

337
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,659
Rym: It was.

338
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,668
Rym: He didn't get Dr.

339
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:47,939
Rym: Mario, one of the bugs.

340
00:15:48,943 --> 00:15:50,160
Scott: It wasn't one of the bugs.

341
00:15:50,422 --> 00:15:51,760
Scott: It was the weird guy.

342
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,675
Rym: He didn't get... No, that is the big representation of the bugs that it puts under the little magnifying glass.

343
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,620
Scott: No, the bugs, that's the different bug guy.

344
00:16:01,542 --> 00:16:02,120
Scott: I'll show you later.

345
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,940
Rym: You also didn't get the eggplant wizard.

346
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,619
Scott: I never got very far in that game.

347
00:16:07,202 --> 00:16:08,940
Scott: I didn't know what the hell the eggplant wizard was.

348
00:16:09,342 --> 00:16:11,280
Scott: I recognized it as something familiar.

349
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,699
Rym: But he's even in Captain N. I mean, what the hell?

350
00:16:13,921 --> 00:16:15,639
Scott: I never really watched Captain N that much.

351
00:16:15,881 --> 00:16:21,839
Rym: Of course, our friend Scott Johnson, who was complaining earlier that he doesn't talk to us enough because he listens to GeekNights instead.

352
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:29,120
Scott: Oh, he's probably listening to this right now, which could be a different time depending on who you are and when you're listening.

353
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,238
Rym: You got less right than Scott did, I hear.

354
00:16:34,181 --> 00:16:34,979
Scott: That's what I remember.

355
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:40,860
Scott: I had to go look at the aim logs, but I'm pretty sure you had a poor showing when I sent you the link this morning.

356
00:16:41,261 --> 00:16:46,039
Rym: Yeah, I mean, almost as poor as Scott, but you got a little bit more poor.

357
00:16:46,901 --> 00:16:48,858
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty poor.

358
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,339
Rym: Anyway, yeah.

359
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,240
Scott: Now we know which Scott is more Scott and which one is not.

360
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,080
Rym: Except originally you were Scott Prime and he was Scott.

361
00:16:57,221 --> 00:16:58,100
Scott: Prime, even better.

362
00:16:58,303 --> 00:16:58,739
Scott: Optimus Prime.

363
00:16:59,387 --> 00:16:59,639
Rym: Whatever.

364
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:08,377
Rym: So anyway, it's a gaming day and we picked up a while ago a board game called Kalis, which has been much hyped.

365
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:13,140
Scott: Well, a lot of people are arguing about whether it's hype or not.

366
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:25,198
Scott: The point is, is that a lot of there's been a lot of buzz and discussion and people saying good things about this game and, you know, encouraging others to play it and saying how great it is and all that stuff.

367
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,259
Scott: The word of mouth.

368
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,959
Rym: Well, we got the game and we've played it.

369
00:17:29,161 --> 00:17:33,300
Rym: And as you read the forums, no, I'm mostly undefeated at it.

370
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,640
Scott: I haven't exactly played it that many times.

371
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:36,340
Rym: Five times.

372
00:17:36,761 --> 00:17:37,379
Scott: Different configurations.

373
00:17:37,665 --> 00:17:38,338
Rym: Five times.

374
00:17:38,982 --> 00:17:39,739
Scott: It's not very many.

375
00:17:40,481 --> 00:17:41,420
Rym: Yeah, you're just bitter.

376
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,039
Rym: But anyway, the game is actually really good.

377
00:17:44,723 --> 00:17:45,880
Scott: It's a pretty good game, yeah.

378
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,380
Rym: It is a hard board game.

379
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,519
Rym: I mean hard like Puerto Rico.

380
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:56,060
Rym: Hard as in solid, luckless, and just brains bashing against each other for an hour.

381
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,460
Scott: Yeah, if you want to play a nice light board game, you know, it's nice and easy.

382
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:04,440
Scott: Just about anyone can get into it, have a lot of fun.

383
00:18:04,844 --> 00:18:05,640
Scott: This is not the game.

384
00:18:05,903 --> 00:18:07,419
Rym: Yeah, you probably want to pick up Carcassonne.

385
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,697
Scott: Yeah, or something else.

386
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,276
Scott: Because Kalis is a lot of pain.

387
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:20,740
Rym: Kalis is one of those rare games where when you finish a game of it, you have not a headache, but definitely this feeling of mental exhaustion.

388
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,860
Rym: Like you have spent a part of your brain that now needs to recover.

389
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:25,360
Scott: I don't feel it that bad.

390
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,879
Scott: Maybe that's because I'm not trying so hard.

391
00:18:27,602 --> 00:18:27,749
Rym: Yeah.

392
00:18:29,761 --> 00:18:34,280
Scott: Anyway, so the game, the premise of the game is that King Phillip the Fair.

393
00:18:34,422 --> 00:18:36,100
Rym: Who is a creepy looking dude, by the way.

394
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,360
Scott: At least if you consider the picture on the front of the box to be a picture of him, he's ugly.

395
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,560
Rym: He is not fair.

396
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,639
Scott: No, he is not.

397
00:18:43,481 --> 00:18:46,140
Scott: So he's building a castle in France.

398
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:47,919
Scott: Ho ho ho ho, the castle.

399
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,280
Rym: Yeah, Scott is very multicultural.

400
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,733
Scott: And you are a laborer.

401
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,477
Scott: Oh, you're not a laborer.

402
00:18:55,882 --> 00:18:57,699
Scott: You're like a build master guy.

403
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,280
Rym: Yeah, like an artisan or something.

404
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,216
Scott: You're something like that.

405
00:19:01,122 --> 00:19:03,480
Scott: And you helped to build his castle.

406
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:08,000
Scott: And everyone else is of course also the same thing as you.

407
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:14,200
Scott: So you're competing to see who can build the most of the castle and gain the most favor from the king.

408
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,600
Scott: Because if the king likes you the most, then that's good for you.

409
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,880
Rym: Now it's not a victory point game, it's a prestige point game.

410
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:29,400
Scott: Yeah, they're victory points, but they call them prestige points because you're competing for prestige of the best castle builder guy.

411
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,040
Rym: Yeah, we'll probably just say victory points, but we might slip back and forth.

412
00:19:33,141 --> 00:19:34,339
Rym: Just so we don't confuse with anyone.

413
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:41,880
Scott: And the other part of it, the reason it's called Calus, is because you're building this castle next to, in, or near the town of Calus.

414
00:19:43,042 --> 00:19:44,440
Scott: Calus is a little shit village.

415
00:19:46,783 --> 00:19:48,719
Scott: Like, it's got a half horse town.

416
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:54,680
Rym: Even though it's got six buildings in it, plus an inn and a stable and a jousting field.

417
00:19:55,422 --> 00:19:56,017
Scott: That's not much.

418
00:19:56,741 --> 00:20:03,920
Scott: Oh, those buildings, the jousting field, those are things the king built while he sits there and waits for the castle people.

419
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,340
Scott: Those aren't part of the town of Calus.

420
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:05,825
Rym: Aha!

421
00:20:06,721 --> 00:20:07,638
Rym: See, this is probably the first time--.

422
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,620
Scott: That's why the bridge is there.

423
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,720
Rym: This is probably the first time you've ever paid attention to the flavor text of a game.

424
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,580
Scott: Well, I think it's kind of important for this game.

425
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,359
Scott: Not really.

426
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:29,920
Scott: Because in other games, you could replace the flavor, but in this game, it's sort of like, if you're going to put a different flavor in, because the flavor is somewhat tied into the game itself, you need to make it match.

427
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,059
Rym: You know?

428
00:20:31,462 --> 00:20:33,940
Rym: Yeah, the theme actually plays into it pretty well.

429
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,579
Rym: Like, if you think of the game in terms of the theme, a lot of the rules make sense.

430
00:20:38,843 --> 00:20:40,320
Rym: As opposed to some other games we've played.

431
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,180
Rym: Like, Tigris and Euphrates is pretty much just, yeah, I'm throwing down red tiles.

432
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,660
Scott: Yeah, you could change the theme in Tigris and Euphrates to anything you want.

433
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,940
Scott: Just replace red, green, blue, and black with anything.

434
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,480
Rym: We don't even remember what the tiles you're supposed to be representing.

435
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,036
Scott: Hemples, harvesty farms.

436
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,091
Rym: Yeah, markets and fishers.

437
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,520
Scott: Something like that.

438
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,340
Scott: It doesn't matter.

439
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:04,819
Scott: It's red, green, blue, and black.

440
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,280
Scott: Anyway, the point is Calus.

441
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:14,459
Scott: The town of Calus, the village, or should I say, that's on the other side of the bridge from the castle, has like six buildings in it.

442
00:21:15,402 --> 00:21:17,379
Scott: And after that, it's pretty much nothing.

443
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:21,660
Scott: I mean, there's a gold mine somewhere, and there's a couple other buildings, but they suck.

444
00:21:22,082 --> 00:21:25,660
Scott: Well, they don't suck, but they're not really part of the town yet.

445
00:21:26,741 --> 00:21:38,258
Scott: And what you do is while you're trying to build the castle and curry favors from the king in order to get prestige, you also have to use the people of the town of Calus to work for you.

446
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,020
Rym: Now the basic game is simply, there are a multitude of ways to gather a multitude of resources.

447
00:21:43,821 --> 00:21:49,019
Rym: You want to convert resources as efficiently as possible into prestige points over the course of the game.

448
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:55,140
Scott: Yep, I mean, you get money, you get cubes of different colors, and you get buildings.

449
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,019
Rym: You get gold, which is a special cube.

450
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:57,930
Scott: Yep.

451
00:21:58,844 --> 00:21:59,619
Scott: What else do you get?

452
00:22:01,046 --> 00:22:01,517
Rym: That's really it.

453
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,060
Rym: I mean, you get favors from the king.

454
00:22:03,381 --> 00:22:04,460
Scott: You get favors from the king.

455
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,959
Rym: Which just turn into other things.

456
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:06,426
Rym: Yep.

457
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:11,159
Scott: You can manipulate the provost and indirectly the bailiff.

458
00:22:11,822 --> 00:22:13,380
Rym: Which are just two mechanics we'll talk about.

459
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:13,727
Rym: Yeah.

460
00:22:15,122 --> 00:22:16,660
Rym: And you can screw with other players.

461
00:22:17,184 --> 00:22:18,979
Scott: Kinda indirectly screw with other players.

462
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,756
Scott: Depending on what you want to do.

463
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:28,160
Rym: Now basically all the game is, is you go around one by one, you have a bunch of workers, six right?

464
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,539
Scott: Six workers, yep.

465
00:22:29,961 --> 00:22:36,320
Rym: And you pay a gold to put a worker somewhere on a building, and then the building doesn't get activated.

466
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,200
Rym: You're just saying I'm putting a worker in that building.

467
00:22:38,581 --> 00:22:41,917
Scott: You basically pay the workers to go out and do work.

468
00:22:43,324 --> 00:22:44,900
Scott: But they don't do the work yet.

469
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:48,200
Scott: You have to pay them to go out there and then we'll see if they do work or not.

470
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,860
Rym: Now there's a nice mechanic here where it costs you say one gold to put one out.

471
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,900
Rym: Now at any time, instead of putting a worker out, you can pass and say I'm done.

472
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,479
Scott: If you can't, if you can't put a worker out, you have to pass.

473
00:22:58,886 --> 00:22:58,977
Rym: Yeah.

474
00:22:59,382 --> 00:23:00,900
Rym: Now once you pass, that's fine.

475
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,780
Rym: Everyone else can still put workers out, but now it costs two.

476
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,099
Rym: And then if someone else passes up, now it costs three.

477
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:16,580
Scott: So what that mechanic does is it says, all right, everyone's going to put out the same number, pretty much the same number of workers each turn.

478
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:24,560
Scott: And if you want to put out more workers than the other people, then you're going to have to pay up extra monies to put out more workers than the other people.

479
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:28,600
Scott: And also, there's an advantage to being the last guy to pass.

480
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:36,700
Scott: But being the last guy to pass might mean you have to put out more workers, even though you might put them on a building you don't want to use and pay extra money.

481
00:23:37,221 --> 00:23:37,606
Scott: So, ooh.

482
00:23:39,141 --> 00:23:42,040
Rym: Also, there's an incentive to pass first because you get one gold.

483
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:42,819
Rym: Yeah.

484
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:43,439
Rym: Just bing.

485
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,180
Scott: If you're really, one gold can be a big difference.

486
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,180
Scott: It can also be nothing.

487
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:55,298
Scott: But passing first gets you the one gold, you know, since passing first really doesn't help you in any other way.

488
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:02,600
Rym: So you keep going around until everyone's passed, and then you start at the castle and go down the road in order, just building, building, building.

489
00:24:03,361 --> 00:24:08,559
Rym: And each building that has a worker in it, you then activate it and do whatever the building does until you hit the end.

490
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:11,940
Rym: Then you do all the other stuff for the turn, and then the turn starts over.

491
00:24:12,001 --> 00:24:12,699
Rym: And that's the whole game.

492
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:17,579
Scott: So you just go down the road and it'll be like, there'll be a building, and someone put a worker in it.

493
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,740
Scott: You can't have two workers in this.

494
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,660
Scott: Well, some buildings can have two workers, but 90% of the buildings can have one worker.

495
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,149
Scott: So if I put a worker in this building, no one else puts a worker in that building this turn.

496
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:31,800
Scott: So you go down the road, you get to the building that says three money on it.

497
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:32,820
Scott: I have a worker there.

498
00:24:32,963 --> 00:24:33,579
Scott: I get three money.

499
00:24:34,021 --> 00:24:37,160
Scott: Go down the road some more, you see a building that says purple cube.

500
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,919
Scott: Rym has a worker in that building, he gets a purple cube.

501
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,280
Rym: That's really, that's the main part of the game.

502
00:24:42,642 --> 00:24:45,195
Scott: Yep, that's, that's pretty much 90% of the rules.

503
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:53,540
Rym: Now you get all these goods and stuff, and buildings, the game starts with a few buildings on the board that aren't owned by anyone.

504
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,098
Rym: You can build more buildings, and the buildings that are built are far superior to the buildings already on the board.

505
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,658
Scott: Infinitely superior.

506
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,660
Rym: Now when you build a building, it's your building.

507
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,379
Rym: You get points for putting it out, and you put your little housey on it.

508
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:15,478
Rym: Now the benefits of you building a building, aside from getting the points, is that one, no matter how many people have passed, it always costs you only one money to go on one of your own buildings.

509
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:29,179
Scott: So you want to kind of not put workers in your own buildings right away, because that way, if other people pass, then you can put a worker in your own building, pass later, and still not pay more money.

510
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:34,880
Rym: Now two, if anyone else puts a worker in your building, they can still use the building.

511
00:25:35,462 --> 00:25:36,659
Rym: But you get a victory point.

512
00:25:37,461 --> 00:25:37,920
Scott: Prestige point.

513
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:38,980
Rym: Victory point.

514
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:39,519
Scott: Awesome.

515
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:45,800
Scott: Yeah, so if you build a nice building, then other people might use it, and thus give you a point.

516
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:51,520
Scott: However, sometimes they'll probably get more than a point from using your building.

517
00:25:51,940 --> 00:26:00,479
Scott: So then you want to use your building right away, but then you lose the advantage of waiting until people pass to use your building, and whoa.

518
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,020
Rym: But if you have a lot of popular buildings, the victory points you get from other people using it really adds up over time.

519
00:26:06,141 --> 00:26:10,819
Scott: If you have two or three popular buildings, you're not going to want to use all three of those in the same turn.

520
00:26:11,241 --> 00:26:15,508
Scott: So maybe you'll put one of your guys in one of them right away, because you need it this turn.

521
00:26:16,002 --> 00:26:17,579
Scott: Then you'll ignore the other ones.

522
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,400
Scott: Someone else will put a guy in one of them, giving you a point.

523
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:26,760
Scott: And then after other people pass, you decide you want to stick around a little while, you'll put a guy in your third building.

524
00:26:27,783 --> 00:26:29,718
Scott: You can get a big advantage that way.

525
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,179
Scott: Not to mention the fact you get a lot of points just for building them.

526
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:33,711
Rym: Yep.

527
00:26:34,262 --> 00:26:35,160
Rym: Now that's all well and good.

528
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,700
Rym: There are a whole bunch of ways to get points there.

529
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:43,500
Rym: Some buildings turn cubes into victory points, or money into gold, and then another building turns gold into victory points, and all sorts of things.

530
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,498
Rym: And you get points for building them.

531
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:51,260
Rym: The primary way, or at least the main way, to get victory points is by actually building the castle, you know, the point of the game.

532
00:26:51,746 --> 00:26:51,860
Scott: Yeah.

533
00:26:52,981 --> 00:26:54,860
Scott: So the castle has like three pieces.

534
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,280
Scott: The dungeon, the wall, and the tower.

535
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,240
Rym: And these are just the three phases of the game, basically.

536
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,380
Scott: Yeah, it's like in the first phase of the game, you build the dungeon.

537
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:09,635
Scott: Now the dungeon's real small, but if you build a piece of the dungeon, you can get a lot of points for it.

538
00:27:10,841 --> 00:27:16,920
Scott: And you can also get a lot of favors if you build more dungeon than other people, or a significant portion of the dungeon.

539
00:27:17,384 --> 00:27:17,540
Scott: Yep.

540
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,060
Scott: I'm not going to go into the rules on that.

541
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,140
Rym: Yeah, and the favors are cool, but we'll talk about them later.

542
00:27:21,281 --> 00:27:22,300
Rym: They're a whole separate mechanic.

543
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:28,859
Scott: Then the walls are the same thing, except the walls are bigger than the dungeon, and therefore it's easier to get a piece of the wall.

544
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:34,660
Scott: But you can get more favors for building a significant portion of the wall, and it's the same rules, just slightly different.

545
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:37,079
Scott: And the tower is the same thing yet again.

546
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,760
Scott: And once the tower is finished, the game is over.

547
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,400
Rym: Now the way you build in the castle is you make batches.

548
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:51,520
Rym: And a ba- I mean, there's a whole bunch of different- there's a cloth- the cubes are cloth, gold, which is special, food, wood, and stone.

549
00:27:53,321 --> 00:27:58,740
Rym: A batch for the king consists of one food and two cubes of any other color, as long as they're different.

550
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,880
Scott: Yeah, so a food is stone is stone is not a batch.

551
00:28:02,042 --> 00:28:03,479
Scott: A food is stone and a wood is a batch.

552
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,579
Scott: A food, a gold, and a cloth is a batch.

553
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,939
Scott: A food, a wood, and a cloth is a batch.

554
00:28:08,741 --> 00:28:12,220
Scott: A stone, a wood, and a cloth is not a batch, because it doesn't have a food in it.

555
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,920
Rym: Now one of the buildings you can put a worker on is the castle.

556
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,120
Scott: And then- Yeah, if you want to submit batches to the castle, you have to put your- one of your workers in the castle.

557
00:28:20,501 --> 00:28:22,160
Rym: Any number of people can be in the castle, though.

558
00:28:22,241 --> 00:28:23,760
Rym: Everyone on the board could be in the castle.

559
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,149
Scott: Yep.

560
00:28:24,701 --> 00:28:26,419
Scott: You can always go to the castle if you want to.

561
00:28:26,661 --> 00:28:27,800
Scott: No one can block you out.

562
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:37,180
Scott: But going in the castle before everyone else has an advantage in that if you tie for most batches, whoever went in earlier wins and gets a favor.

563
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:44,580
Rym: But at the same time, going last is an advantage, because then you know what everyone else put in, and you know exactly how many you need to put in to beat everyone.

564
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:50,600
Scott: Yeah, but the advantage of that is you just don't go in if you can't beat everyone, and you wait till next turn when you have more.

565
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,859
Rym: Yep, but then it depends on if you have a whole bunch of batches, and you know you can beat everyone anyway.

566
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:58,920
Rym: You go last, beat whoever went in by one, and keep the rest of your batches.

567
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,018
Scott: Yep, yep.

568
00:29:00,421 --> 00:29:03,259
Rym: It's all- you really have to think a lot in this game about those sorts of things.

569
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:09,199
Rym: Like, there's always an advantage to doing one thing, but a similar advantage in the opposite end for doing the other thing.

570
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,040
Scott: It just depends on what you have, and the timing, and the order in which things execute.

571
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,300
Rym: Now, there's a funny little mechanic in the batches.

572
00:29:18,041 --> 00:29:23,499
Rym: If you put a guy in the castle, and then for whatever reason you don't put a batch in, you lose victory points.

573
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:24,340
Rym: Straight up.

574
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:24,902
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

575
00:29:24,942 --> 00:29:28,849
Scott: you went up to the king, and you said, "King, I have brought you pieces of the castle,".

576
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:29,740
Scott: and he goes, "Oh, really?

577
00:29:30,483 --> 00:29:30,951
Scott: I don't see

578
00:29:31,012 --> 00:29:31,379
Scott: anything.".

579
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:33,117
Rym: And then you go, "I got

580
00:29:33,158 --> 00:29:33,380
Rym: nothing.".

581
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,560
Scott: And then the king hates you, and you suck.

582
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:46,320
Rym: And you can ignore the castle, but once the part that they're building is scored, you know, when it finishes, and scoring, you don't get extra points, you usually get favors from the king.

583
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:51,000
Rym: Anyone who doesn't have any batches in each section loses even more points.

584
00:29:51,261 --> 00:29:56,340
Scott: Yeah, so if you don't build any part of the dungeon, you lose some points, but not that many, but it still sucks.

585
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,879
Rym: Yeah, and the losses increase.

586
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:04,120
Scott: If you don't build any part of the wall... Now, the wall's a lot bigger than the dungeon, so it's hard to get shut out of the wall.

587
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:08,200
Scott: I mean, you'd really have to suck to build nothing in the wall at all.

588
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,660
Scott: If you build no part of the wall, you lose even more points.

589
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:21,439
Scott: The tower... I don't know how you couldn't possibly build a piece of the tower, but if you really suck, and you don't build any part of the giant, giant tower, you lose a shit ton of points.

590
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:23,459
Scott: You're basically lost the game.

591
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,480
Rym: Now, aside from all that, we mentioned the provost and the bailiff.

592
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,300
Rym: The bailiff is basically just the march of time.

593
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:43,274
Rym: He moves inerringly toward the end of the board, and a phase can change, like the dungeon phase, it'll change when the whole dungeon is built, or when the bailiff gets past the dungeon area on the board and hits the wall area.

594
00:30:45,102 --> 00:30:47,280
Rym: Either one of those conditions triggers the scoring of the dungeon.

595
00:30:47,881 --> 00:30:53,240
Scott: I think it's when the bailiff touches the end of the dungeon area, not the beginning of the wall area, but whatever.

596
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,660
Rym: And when he touches the end part, where the tower is, that's the end of the game.

597
00:30:57,161 --> 00:30:58,439
Scott: Yeah, yep, that's the end.

598
00:30:58,761 --> 00:31:00,699
Rym: And the provost is a really cool guy.

599
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,378
Scott: He's a really cool guy.

600
00:31:03,001 --> 00:31:04,219
Scott: Now, the provost does two things.

601
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,060
Scott: Number one is people move him around.

602
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:15,139
Scott: Like, there's a building that you can use that allows you to bribe the provost, and well, it basically means you move him around for free, a whole bunch.

603
00:31:15,866 --> 00:31:17,320
Scott: And there's the bridge.

604
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:25,569
Scott: Everyone goes on the bridge when you pass, but whoever passed first pays zero, one, two, or three money to move the provost.

605
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,780
Scott: zero, one, two, or three spaces accordingly.

606
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:37,320
Rym: Now, there aren't that many spaces on the board, and if you have a game with five people, that's up to 18 spaces he could move, depending on how people move him.

607
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:37,730
Scott: Yep.

608
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:53,660
Scott: And then, of course, the guy who passed second can move the provost third, fourth, fifth, so whoever is the last person to pass on placing workers gets to move the provost last, which is a huge advantage, which means you can shut people out with him.

609
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,700
Rym: Now, you may be wondering, why would I want to move the provost?

610
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,239
Rym: What is the mechanic here?

611
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:09,500
Scott: Well, the first thing is that the provost is moved to a position on the board after the bailiff, then the bailiff will march forward two spaces that turn.

612
00:32:10,222 --> 00:32:18,040
Scott: If the provost is on the same space as the bailiff, or before the bailiff, the bailiff will only move forward one space that turn.

613
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:22,580
Scott: That's a big deal, because you can make the game move really quick.

614
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:31,660
Scott: I mean, if you keep moving the provost forward every turn, you'll finish the dungeon in three turns, which means people have three turns to get a batch in, or they're screwed.

615
00:32:32,442 --> 00:32:34,779
Scott: So, there's something big with that.

616
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,256
Rym: Now, two, the board is a line.

617
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,079
Rym: It just goes a windy line.

618
00:32:39,241 --> 00:32:40,880
Scott: Yeah, they make it windy to fit on a board.

619
00:32:41,444 --> 00:32:43,200
Scott: It could be a straight line, it wouldn't make a difference.

620
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,280
Rym: And it gets built in order, and things get activated in order.

621
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:55,100
Rym: Anything that is beyond whatever square the provost is sitting on doesn't get activated, and if you put a worker on one of those buildings, well, fuck you.

622
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:06,920
Scott: Yeah, so let's say there's a building that gives you a wood cube, and then a building that gives you a stone cube, and when we're putting workers out, you put a worker on the stone cube building.

623
00:33:07,523 --> 00:33:10,680
Scott: The provost gets moved all the way back to the wood cube building.

624
00:33:11,501 --> 00:33:13,200
Scott: The stone cube building never gets activated.

625
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:24,760
Scott: Your worker is sitting on it, you paid to put the worker there, but you're never going to get that stone cube, because the provost won't let the buildings behind him, or in front of him, depending on your point of view, get activated.

626
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,898
Rym: See, now you might have been wondering earlier, why would you go into the castle if you didn't have a batch?

627
00:33:29,361 --> 00:33:32,500
Rym: Well, you might have been expecting a batch, but then the provost cocked you.

628
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:40,896
Scott: Yeah, I put my guy out to get a food cube, because I got plenty of other cubes, and if I can get every food cube I get, it's pretty much a batch, because I have so many other cubes.

629
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:49,060
Scott: Well, the provost moves before the building that gives me food cubes, and I already put my guy in the castle, and now I'm in big trouble.

630
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:55,097
Rym: Yep, so there's a lot to think about in this game, and a lot of ways to manipulate and scheme.

631
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:06,559
Rym: I mean, it looks like in a five player game, there will often be semi-formal alliances, where, like, say I go on the go- like, we're near the gold gets there, we get close to the gold, and I put a guy on the gold.

632
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:14,138
Rym: No one wants me to have gold, and they're going to try to push the provost past the gold so I won't get it, but I want to push it beyond the gold so I'll get it.

633
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,335
Rym: Someone else might say, "Eh, Rym's trying to get the

634
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:17,717
Rym: gold.".

635
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:22,672
Rym: I'm going to put all my workers around that area in the other buildings that are close to the guy.

636
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:27,297
Rym: That way, I know Rym will fight to keep his gold, which will protect my workers, too.

637
00:34:28,385 --> 00:34:30,440
Rym: And then Scott will say, "Oh, those two fuckers are winning.

638
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,916
Rym: Everyone else, we gotta keep the provost from getting out

639
00:34:32,956 --> 00:34:33,138
Rym: there.".

640
00:34:33,561 --> 00:34:56,159
Scott: Yeah, I generally assume that any building within three spaces of the provost is a dangerous area, but if someone else puts a guy way out there in the dangerous area, I'll be willing to put a guy one or two spaces behind their guy where I normally wouldn't feel safe putting him, you know, with the knowledge that, hey, that guy is also going to move the provost away, you know?

641
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:59,534
Scott: And, of course, there's a chance that he could still be shut out.

642
00:34:59,615 --> 00:35:02,339
Scott: and I still get my building far away and we both win.

643
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:08,179
Rym: Yep, I usually seem to play very conservatively with the provost, but I have, on occasion, gone balls out and gone right up to the edge.

644
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:22,020
Scott: Yeah, I also try to be real conservative and I only go for the edge either when I really want a building and I also have a lot of money to move the provost a lot and I have the building that lets me move the provost a lot, you know?

645
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:27,064
Scott: Like, if there's a building near the edge that you want, go to the building that lets you move the provost

646
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:27,626
Rym: a lot

647
00:35:27,746 --> 00:35:40,220
Scott: first and if you get that building, then after everyone else takes their turn, you'll see, oh, okay, you know, if they put guys way out near the end, then don't put your guy way out near the end, just use that building to screw them.

648
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:47,400
Rym: Yep, putting a guy there early in the round makes, it's a big deterrent for anyone else going near the edge until you put your guys down.

649
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,039
Rym: Yeah, until you claim a spot.

650
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:54,799
Scott: And then if no one else puts their guy near the edge for you to screw them, then put your guy near the edge where he'll be perfectly safe.

651
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,060
Rym: Unless everyone gangs up on you.

652
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:03,691
Scott: Unless everyone gangs up on you, but all, it depends a lot on the number of players, like, the number of players really changes this game.

653
00:36:04,072 --> 00:36:07,144
Scott: in a four player game that's three whole spaces.

654
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:10,420
Scott: the provost can't move that he could have moved in a five player game.

655
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,400
Rym: In addition to there's so much more contention for good buildings and favors.

656
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:21,716
Scott: Yeah, there aren't any more buildings in a more player game, there's still the same number of buildings out there, but now there's a whole lot more workers going out.

657
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:26,160
Rym: Now there's only one more mechanic in the whole game.

658
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:34,200
Rym: The game's actually, it looks really complex, and it is really complex in terms of the paths to victory, but the game itself is actually very simple.

659
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:53,280
Scott: Yeah, when I tried to figure out how to play the game I was pretty confused, but then once you learn the symbols on the board, and the symbols are really self explanatory, but once you learn all the symbols, it's sort of like learning a little picturized language, once you learn them all, you know exactly how to play this game perfectly.

660
00:36:53,360 --> 00:37:01,460
Rym: Like oh, that building costs one food and one stone, it produces blah blah blah, it gives me blah victory points.

661
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:12,278
Scott: It's just, you have to know what the symbols mean, and what they mean in different contexts, so if I see that symbol here it means this, but if I see the same symbol over there it means that.

662
00:37:13,663 --> 00:37:15,740
Rym: Now the only other mechanic are the favors of the king.

663
00:37:16,385 --> 00:37:17,300
Scott: Ah, the favors of the king.

664
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,820
Rym: And they're cool, basically there's four tracks.

665
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:25,500
Rym: Victory points, money, cubes, and building buildings.

666
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:30,800
Rym: These four tracks, you have a marker on each one, and it's increasing returns.

667
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,818
Rym: The further to the right you get on these tracks, the greater the reward is.

668
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:42,240
Rym: And every time you get a favor, you pick one of those tracks, advance your little marker, and take any of the favors in that row that you are on or that are to the left of you.

669
00:37:42,461 --> 00:37:45,418
Scott: So basically the king comes to you and he says, "You have done a good job, I favor

670
00:37:46,011 --> 00:37:46,138
Scott: you.".

671
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:54,667
Scott: And you can say, "Alright king, I would like some money," or, "I would like some victory points," or, "I would like a cube," or, "I would like to build a building, can you help me

672
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:54,878
Scott: out?".

673
00:37:54,961 --> 00:37:56,299
Scott: And you know, you pick one of the four.

674
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:03,300
Scott: And depending on how many times the king is giving you a favor and you've picked the same thing, you can do it better and better.

675
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:10,299
Scott: So the first time you ask for a cube it gives you a feud cube, but like the sixth time you ask for a cube, you get a gold cube.

676
00:38:11,103 --> 00:38:13,520
Rym: And the victory points are just one, two, three, four, five.

677
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,520
Scott: And the money I think is three, four, five, six, seven?

678
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:15,970
Rym: Yep.

679
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,360
Rym: And then the building buildings, this is one kind of kicker in the game.

680
00:38:20,141 --> 00:38:21,159
Rym: You can't just build buildings.

681
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:21,611
Scott: Nope.

682
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:26,240
Rym: You can't do any action in this game without putting a worker on a building somewhere.

683
00:38:26,962 --> 00:38:29,797
Rym: So there is a building that says, "You can build a wood type

684
00:38:29,857 --> 00:38:30,179
Rym: building.".

685
00:38:31,301 --> 00:38:36,889
Rym: There is one wood type building, only one, that says, "Ah, this building lets you build stone type

686
00:38:36,909 --> 00:38:37,356
Rym: buildings.".

687
00:38:38,601 --> 00:38:42,520
Rym: There is a building that lets you build the green type buildings, the residences.

688
00:38:43,842 --> 00:38:48,395
Rym: And there is a building that lets you turn residences into blue buildings or prestige buildings.

689
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:54,300
Scott: Those are basically, those buildings don't do much, but they give you a whole lot of points when you build them.

690
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,600
Rym: Those are the big buildings.

691
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,480
Scott: The stone and the wood buildings do a whole lot of stuff.

692
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,060
Scott: The stone buildings do more than the wood buildings.

693
00:39:01,101 --> 00:39:02,240
Scott: They're like super buildings.

694
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:08,240
Scott: And the green buildings don't do anything because they're all the same, but they increase the income you get each turn.

695
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,240
Scott: So if you have a couple of them, you get a lot of money.

696
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:15,018
Rym: And they give you a place to build blue buildings, which can only be built on top of other buildings you own.

697
00:39:15,381 --> 00:39:15,859
Scott: Green ones.

698
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,220
Rym: Yeah.

699
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,279
Scott: That are yours, yeah.

700
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:25,540
Scott: The green buildings also can only be built on top of buildings you already own or the pink buildings that start out in the game.

701
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:26,012
Rym: Yep.

702
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:34,380
Rym: A common strategy I've had is to build all the buildings that make stone and then build a residence over the pink building that makes stone, thus having a monopoly on stone.

703
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:38,300
Scott: Yeah, you eliminate the competition that the board presents right at the beginning.

704
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,178
Scott: That's a good strategy.

705
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,054
Scott: But yeah.

706
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:47,860
Rym: Now the building a building favor is big because one, you can now build a building without needing those cards, those buildings.

707
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:58,878
Scott: Yeah, so let's say that the thing that lets people build stone buildings isn't on the board, but you get enough favors to build a stone building without that building that's usually on the board.

708
00:39:59,581 --> 00:40:02,059
Scott: So now you're building stone buildings and no one else can.

709
00:40:02,502 --> 00:40:05,000
Rym: Plus those favors also let you build them at a discount.

710
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,418
Scott: Yeah, you don't have to actually use a stone cube to build a stone building if you use the favors.

711
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:10,220
Rym: Yep.

712
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:16,400
Rym: Now, I mean, that favor sounds really powerful, but it's mitigated by the fact that the first space on that track is nothing.

713
00:40:16,903 --> 00:40:19,079
Rym: So taking the first favor there doesn't do anything for you.

714
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,398
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

715
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:29,840
Rym: The game is insanely well balanced with the possible exception of this one expansion building that turns gold into victory points at some sick rate.

716
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:34,180
Scott: Yeah, there was this... In the game, there's pretty much a building for everything.

717
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,520
Scott: I mean, there's a building that lets you turn money into gold.

718
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:42,340
Scott: There's a building that lets you turn money into cubes, cubes into money.

719
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:47,899
Rym: There are a lot of combos where you can take one cube and shunt it through three buildings and end up with four cubes instead, things like that.

720
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:54,740
Scott: Yeah, I like to, what I do is turn a cube into a pile of money and then turn some of that money back into like two cubes.

721
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,719
Scott: So like turn one cube into like some money and some cubes.

722
00:40:58,444 --> 00:40:59,059
Scott: It's a good move.

723
00:40:59,861 --> 00:41:03,960
Scott: Anyway, this one building that was, it's not even in the instruction book.

724
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:09,959
Scott: It was given out as an expansion at Essen, which is the German super gaming convention that I'd like to go to one day.

725
00:41:11,581 --> 00:41:17,559
Scott: They just threw it into the second printing of the game, which is what I have, without, you know, making mention of it at all.

726
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,400
Scott: And what it does is allows you, I think, to turn gold into a sick number of victory points.

727
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:26,900
Rym: Like the game we played at Gaming for Hope, it was a five player game.

728
00:41:27,403 --> 00:41:28,560
Rym: I had run away with the game.

729
00:41:28,741 --> 00:41:31,460
Rym: I was a full halfway around the board from everyone else.

730
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:41,060
Rym: There was nothing they could do about it until one guy who was, he was pretty much at the leader of the loser pack, built that building and started chunking gold into it.

731
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,197
Rym: And he almost caught up to me.

732
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,199
Rym: Like suddenly the game turned around completely for that one guy.

733
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:51,117
Scott: Yeah, the gold cubes are sort of special in that number one, they're harder to get than any of the other cubes.

734
00:41:51,524 --> 00:41:51,620
Rym: Yep.

735
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,020
Scott: And two, they only have a few uses.

736
00:41:55,161 --> 00:42:01,240
Scott: Number one, you can use them as like where you would normally use a cube as like a batch or convert it into money.

737
00:42:01,361 --> 00:42:03,960
Scott: But that's kind of silly because gold has special powers.

738
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,540
Scott: So using it for those purposes is kind of a waste.

739
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,339
Rym: Unless, you know, you need an emergency batch.

740
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:14,636
Scott: Yeah, like I would rather sacrifice the gold than get the minus two points for not having a batch.

741
00:42:15,521 --> 00:42:23,400
Scott: But anyway, what you primarily use gold for is number one, all the blue buildings require gold, the ones that you build on top of the green buildings.

742
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:28,680
Scott: So those blue buildings can give you a shit ton of points when you build them.

743
00:42:29,121 --> 00:42:31,240
Rym: So I once recently built the biggest one.

744
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:36,100
Rym: It would cost like three gold and five stone and it's worth like 25 victory points or something.

745
00:42:36,481 --> 00:42:39,260
Scott: It's insane, but you know, that's what gold is good for.

746
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:43,820
Scott: Also, at the end of the game, every gold cube you have gets you three points.

747
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:44,155
Rym: Yep.

748
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,237
Rym: Basically the game, when it ends, everything you have, there's a conversion directly into points.

749
00:42:49,673 --> 00:42:49,839
Scott: Yep.

750
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:53,280
Scott: Like every four cubes you have that aren't gold, you get a point.

751
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,900
Scott: Every three money you have left at the end of the game is a point.

752
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:56,260
Rym: Yep.

753
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:05,520
Rym: So you can use those as the, all right, is there any way before this game's end, game ends, I can turn what I've got into victory points more efficiently than that right there because that's the final value.

754
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:14,620
Scott: That's really the whole point of the game is to collect those resources and then convert them into victory points more efficiently than you would if you're holding on to them.

755
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:19,420
Scott: Like think about when you're playing the game, I'm going to about to spend three money.

756
00:43:19,881 --> 00:43:24,000
Scott: Is that going to end up getting me more than one prestige point?

757
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:31,359
Scott: If no, that's probably not a good way to spend the three money because if you just held on to that money till the end of the game, you'd get one point.

758
00:43:32,661 --> 00:43:34,559
Scott: So, you know, it's the same thing with cubes.

759
00:43:34,961 --> 00:43:36,619
Scott: I'm about to do something with four cubes.

760
00:43:37,003 --> 00:43:38,659
Scott: Am I going to get more than one point for that?

761
00:43:39,342 --> 00:43:41,440
Scott: If not, it's probably a bad idea.

762
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:42,959
Scott: Same thing with the gold.

763
00:43:43,462 --> 00:43:47,816
Scott: If you're going to turn gold into less than three points, you're probably wasting the gold.

764
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:55,020
Rym: Now the game is very, I mean, you know, I've talked a lot in various times about how some games are strategic and some games are tactical.

765
00:43:56,281 --> 00:44:02,177
Rym: As in some games, you can plan ahead and you can have like a plan, like I'm going to go for this and this and this and do this.

766
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:03,779
Rym: And some, yeah.

767
00:44:04,481 --> 00:44:08,200
Scott: And they, yeah, strategic game is, it's not because you could do that in any game.

768
00:44:08,281 --> 00:44:09,559
Scott: You could always come up with a plan.

769
00:44:09,861 --> 00:44:14,980
Scott: The point is in a strategic game, the plan you come up with beforehand is matters.

770
00:44:16,141 --> 00:44:18,960
Scott: Like if you go into, like Stratego is a game of strategy.

771
00:44:19,301 --> 00:44:21,439
Scott: Your plan is how you set up your dudes.

772
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,960
Rym: Yep, because it's all pre-planned.

773
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:30,780
Rym: And there are very few actual tactical decisions to make in Stratego because it's usually fairly obvious what you should do for a given situation.

774
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:39,719
Scott: Yeah, you just look at what the board is and you see what you've got and you know which guys, the other guy has moved and you know where some bombs are and your move is pretty obvious.

775
00:44:40,602 --> 00:44:42,140
Scott: It's all about pre-planning.

776
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:44,479
Scott: Pre-planning matters the most in a strategic game.

777
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:49,100
Rym: Then there's a game like Tigers and Euphrates, which is, leans much more heavily toward tactics.

778
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:57,200
Scott: Yeah, you can go into Tigris and Euphrates saying, I'm going to do this and this and this with a bunch of these cubes, but, or these tiles, not cubes.

779
00:44:58,301 --> 00:44:58,978
Rym: Well, you get cubes.

780
00:44:59,221 --> 00:44:59,617
Scott: You get cubes.

781
00:45:00,743 --> 00:45:02,000
Scott: But that doesn't really matter.

782
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:06,100
Scott: What matters is the decisions you make on the fly in the game.

783
00:45:06,482 --> 00:45:08,619
Scott: No matter pre-planning is going to help you win.

784
00:45:09,002 --> 00:45:16,840
Rym: Because you can plan all you want, but you have to really be able to take tactical advantage of a situation like, Oh, he just fucked up and put this tile here.

785
00:45:16,942 --> 00:45:17,818
Rym: That means I can do this.

786
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,699
Rym: My whole strategy just changed.

787
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:22,040
Scott: Yeah, it's not, you can't plan for that.

788
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:25,020
Scott: You just kind of see how things go each and every turn.

789
00:45:25,581 --> 00:45:31,674
Scott: And every time you take an action, you have to consider the situation on the fly and make the right move.

790
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,018
Rym: Kalis really seems to be a healthy balance of the two.

791
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:35,668
Scott: Yeah.

792
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:43,400
Rym: It's like, I mean, there's zero randomness other than the initial setup of the board and the initial turn order.

793
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:44,334
Rym: Yeah, but that's it.

794
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,419
Rym: Yeah, that's it.

795
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:57,720
Rym: The game is, is so precise and there's so little luck and randomness that basically you have the tactical considerations of everything that happens to me is caused by another player.

796
00:45:58,062 --> 00:45:59,640
Rym: I have to anticipate their actions and react.

797
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:04,020
Scott: I think the randomness in the game isn't, it's not gameplay related.

798
00:46:04,121 --> 00:46:07,460
Scott: What it is, is to make it so the game isn't the same game every time.

799
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:07,755
Rym: Yep.

800
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:14,400
Rym: Because if the game were set up the same way every time, then they'd be like, I'd be in the situation where, all right, I go first and the board's this way.

801
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,260
Rym: So I do this no matter what, if I go first every time I ever play Kalis.

802
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:17,790
Scott: Yep.

803
00:46:17,981 --> 00:46:18,800
Scott: It's like battle tech.

804
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:22,820
Scott: The different map doesn't make the game random, even though battle tech's a random game.

805
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,380
Rym: I mean, there's, there's no randomness at all in Kalis.

806
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:29,980
Scott: It's like Kalis, there's six buildings that start out on the board, but they start in a random order.

807
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:32,600
Scott: So how many possible starting positions is that?

808
00:46:32,941 --> 00:46:33,538
Rym: Six times six.

809
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:33,960
Scott: Yeah.

810
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:35,817
Scott: So there's 36, basically you get 36 maps.

811
00:46:36,545 --> 00:46:37,340
Rym: It's six factorial.

812
00:46:38,083 --> 00:46:38,499
Scott: Oh, that's right.

813
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:42,960
Scott: So there is six factorial "maps" in quotes in Kalis.

814
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:47,340
Rym: Yeah, but everyone knows the map and the starting order right as the game begins.

815
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:53,299
Rym: So at that point you can immediately, one, formulate your strategy, knowing exactly how the game is going to go.

816
00:46:53,580 --> 00:47:05,119
Scott: If you see like a certain building is really close to the bridge, then that building is never going to get provosted early on, which means the game is going to lean in this way, which means this is what you kind of want to lean, do.

817
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:11,740
Rym: But at the other, on the other hand, there are a lot of other players with their own strategies and they're going to try to do their thing.

818
00:47:12,341 --> 00:47:14,480
Rym: And you have to take advantage of them and not be taken advantage of.

819
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:21,660
Scott: So on any individual turn, you'll see like, okay, he has this many cubes and he's got his worker there and he has that many money and he put his worker there.

820
00:47:22,041 --> 00:47:24,520
Scott: That means if I go for that, then I'm going to get fucked.

821
00:47:24,661 --> 00:47:26,740
Scott: But if I go for that, then I can fuck them.

822
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:27,397
Scott: Let me go for that.

823
00:47:28,281 --> 00:47:29,860
Rym: It's just, it's one of those rare games.

824
00:47:29,981 --> 00:47:33,140
Rym: I can't think of many games that have a very good balance of the two.

825
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,000
Rym: Most games really lean to one or the other.

826
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:35,440
Scott: Yep.

827
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:45,520
Scott: Now, the only negative thing I can really say about this game is that at first glance, it looked like there were going to be many different ways to achieve victory points.

828
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:45,860
Rym: Yep.

829
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:47,040
Rym: Many paths to victory.

830
00:47:47,302 --> 00:47:48,700
Rym: And I still think that's true.

831
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:49,220
Scott: There are.

832
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:58,960
Scott: However, I kind of got this feeling at first that, you know, the castle seems to be like the main way, it always seems to be a main way of getting points in any game.

833
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:05,640
Scott: Like in Alhambra, the main way of getting points is most of a color in the scoring round.

834
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:07,560
Rym: Puerto Rico, it's shipping things.

835
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,140
Scott: Yeah, but there's also other ways to get points.

836
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:16,640
Scott: Like in Puerto Rico, you can also get points, you know, from doing other things like big buildings and other stuff.

837
00:48:17,161 --> 00:48:25,120
Scott: And in Alhambra, you can get points for having the longest wall, you know, that there are other ways to get points that are secondary or perhaps tertiary.

838
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:35,520
Scott: Well, it looked to me when I first started reading the instructions of Kalis that they're, you know, going for the castle, which is the main way of getting points.

839
00:48:37,743 --> 00:48:52,898
Scott: You know, there is a way to just go through the game with not completely ignoring, but largely ignoring the castle and using the other mechanisms of point getting like building buildings and getting gold and all that and coming out way ahead.

840
00:48:53,681 --> 00:49:02,960
Rym: Meanwhile, I heard the rules of the game and immediately thought, I'm going to hammer that castle relentlessly every time I play this game as hard and as fast as I can.

841
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:09,318
Scott: And it was slightly disappointing that it seems that you really can't ignore the castle all that much.

842
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:13,575
Rym: You see, I'll note that I really think you can mostly ignore the castle in a many player game.

843
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:18,600
Scott: Yeah, see, I think I was the line where you can't ignore the castle below the line.

844
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:24,960
Scott: It's like you have to do the minimum effort in the castle, which makes sense because the whole game is building the castle.

845
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:25,860
Scott: I know, I know.

846
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,860
Rym: If you're just a gold trader, why don't you go play Gold Traders of Kalis?

847
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:35,560
Scott: Because maybe I can trade so much gold that the king will go, whoa, you got so much gold, I don't give a shit about those guys building my castle.

848
00:49:35,581 --> 00:49:35,898
Scott: You know what?

849
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,700
Rym: You kind of can with that one gold building.

850
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:40,500
Scott: You can, but you know, it's not the point I'm trying to make.

851
00:49:40,781 --> 00:49:45,579
Rym: Yeah, I think the point is it's mostly that we play the two player game a bunch of times and we played the three player game once.

852
00:49:46,201 --> 00:49:54,980
Rym: And in those small player games, you can put so much into the castle because there's so little competition that the castle is really the primary means to get victory points.

853
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:00,620
Scott: I mean, putting one batch in the castle, even with the tower, gets you what, three points?

854
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:04,039
Scott: Getting a favor gets you an average three points.

855
00:50:05,081 --> 00:50:07,600
Scott: So, you know, getting a gold gets you three points.

856
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:10,600
Rym: But in the five player game, there's a lot more competition in the castle.

857
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:11,979
Scott: Huge competition in the castle.

858
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:19,279
Rym: You can either go all out for the castle or hang with the castle and go all out on like gold or all out on money.

859
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:30,080
Scott: In a more player game, you really can't go all out on the castle because there are just so many people trying to have to get their batches in that there's no room to get enough points in the castle.

860
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:33,160
Scott: All you'll do by maxing out the castle is end the game faster.

861
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:38,060
Scott: Though, you need to get the castle and points elsewhere in a more player game.

862
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:51,260
Rym: Yes, though in the one five player game we played, I won by ignoring everything but the castle, only doing the castle, and trying to end the game as fast as possible so that no one could even start all their other victory point generation schemes.

863
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:57,140
Scott: Yeah, I really don't know how... See, the problem is that a lot of the games we played are with inexperienced players.

864
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:04,000
Scott: I really want to see what'll happen if we play with like five Kalis masters or five well-learned Kalis players.

865
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:05,159
Rym: Yeah, it's like with Puerto Rico.

866
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:11,095
Rym: When we first played Puerto Rico, it was like we played... None of us knew how to play and there were obvious paths to victory.

867
00:51:11,155 --> 00:51:13,837
Rym: and "Oh, he's got the harbor captain blah blah blah, he

868
00:51:13,878 --> 00:51:14,060
Rym: wins.".

869
00:51:15,061 --> 00:51:20,980
Rym: And then as we got good at the game, it got to the point where crazier and crazier strategies kept emerging.

870
00:51:21,941 --> 00:51:27,678
Rym: And it ended up, we basically discovered that in a three player game, the factory is pretty much the way to go to win.

871
00:51:28,302 --> 00:51:29,417
Rym: Depending on the situation, but...

872
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:30,759
Scott: At least for now.

873
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,919
Rym: Yeah, in three player games too.

874
00:51:33,562 --> 00:51:35,100
Rym: Five player Puerto Rico is totally different.

875
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:40,199
Scott: That threw me off once because I was playing a perfect three player game and I forgot there were four players at once.

876
00:51:40,662 --> 00:51:43,780
Rym: And meanwhile, I realized that and bought a warehouse, which was key.

877
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:52,200
Scott: Yeah, that was a crazy game because I felt like I was doing great in this one game of Puerto Rico, but then I forgot there was a fourth player and then my game fell apart.

878
00:51:54,203 --> 00:51:55,899
Scott: If it would have been a three player game, I would have won.

879
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:05,980
Rym: Yeah, but that's one thing we miss from RIT is that our, you know, the front row crew, the people we run with are for the very... They're largely very good rote gamers.

880
00:52:06,521 --> 00:52:07,999
Rym: They're very good at German games.

881
00:52:08,663 --> 00:52:12,420
Rym: And when we get a game, we all progress at largely the same rate.

882
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,960
Rym: And we, I don't know, we're good.

883
00:52:15,041 --> 00:52:15,456
Rym: What can I say?

884
00:52:16,601 --> 00:52:22,179
Rym: We've ended up playing a lot of games with people who aren't so good lately just because of where we live and what free time we have.

885
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:29,040
Scott: And even like our crew, you know, we play the games with them and then we play the games with just us or with other people.

886
00:52:29,441 --> 00:52:36,740
Scott: So our skill level gets way ahead of theirs because the number of plays they have under their belt is significantly lower than the number of plays we have.

887
00:52:36,961 --> 00:52:40,240
Rym: Yeah, so yeah, geeks move out here and we'll play board games.

888
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:41,418
Scott: Lots of board games.

889
00:52:42,741 --> 00:52:44,280
Rym: But I guess I really like Kalis.

890
00:52:44,742 --> 00:52:45,639
Rym: I think it's a great game.

891
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,140
Scott: Yeah, really good game.

892
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:47,899
Scott: Glad I bought it.

893
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:50,479
Scott: It lives up to... I could see why everyone was talking about it.

894
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:56,100
Scott: I don't know if it's a T&E, but for the time being, it's going to get more play, I think.

895
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:01,798
Rym: Yeah, it's a long ways out to Lodacon, but we'll probably bring it and...

896
00:53:02,281 --> 00:53:02,878
Scott: Absolutely bring it.

897
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:09,500
Rym: Well, I don't know if we'll have time to play with any of our fans out there since we as the crew want to play this game, but we can at least show you the game.

898
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,918
Scott: Yeah, you can stand around and watch and talk to us.

899
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:14,340
Scott: There'll be plenty of time for talking to you.

900
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:16,820
Scott: I don't know if there'll be an hour for a Kalis game.

901
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:20,800
Rym: Yeah, though I do point out that there's the Thursday at the con.

902
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:25,000
Scott: Oh, that's true, but we're usually spending that in the hot tub.

903
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:28,000
Rym: We could play some games in the hot tub.

904
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:29,299
Scott: Not Kalis.

905
00:53:30,943 --> 00:53:33,660
Scott: Unless you want to make inflatable waterproof Kalis.

906
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:34,499
Rym: That would be awesome.

907
00:53:34,761 --> 00:53:41,340
Scott: Hit a little king's castle floating in the hot tub, throwing cubes at it.

908
00:53:42,381 --> 00:53:50,740
Rym: But anyway, since I brought up Odacon, don't forget that tomorrow, Anime Day, we're going to be bringing you our actual coverage of Toracon 2006.

909
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:57,000
Rym: And for anyone who doesn't listen to all the Days of GeekNights, yesterday we played the live show we did at Toracon.

910
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:02,080
Scott: Yeah, which didn't really have anything to do with anime, which is why we ended up deciding to play it yesterday.

911
00:54:02,221 --> 00:54:05,240
Scott: Also because we were really tired and we didn't want to do a show yesterday.

912
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:09,660
Rym: We actually, little secret for anyone who's still listening, we recorded the news yesterday twice.

913
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,779
Rym: We recorded it, we were so tired it was crap, we just re-recorded it.

914
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,620
Scott: Yep, and it was a little bit better.

915
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:17,136
Rym: Yeah.

916
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,960
Scott: Yeah, but I think we'll be good today, we'll be good tomorrow.

917
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:22,419
Scott: Well, we were good today.

918
00:54:22,922 --> 00:54:23,009
Scott: Yeah.

919
00:54:24,246 --> 00:54:25,080
Rym: We got a lot for tomorrow.

920
00:54:25,902 --> 00:54:27,920
Rym: We'll figure out what we're going to do Thursday at some point.

921
00:54:28,562 --> 00:54:30,440
Scott: Oh great, it'll probably be ass.

922
00:54:37,913 --> 00:54:39,990
Rym: And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

923
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:42,649
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

924
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:47,469
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontrowcrew.com.

925
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:51,449

00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:55,449
Scott: You can send your email feedback to geeknights@gmail.com.

Scott: And if you want, you can leave us a voicemail at 206-333-1537.

928
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:05,550
Rym: GeekNights airs every weeknight, Monday through Thursday.

929
00:55:06,253 --> 00:55:09,490
Scott: GeekNights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

930
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:13,370
Scott: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
