00:00:08,698 --> 00:00:11,510
Rym: if this goes well this may happen more times in the future.

4
00:00:12,114 --> 00:00:14,189
Rym: We have some guest hosts for the show.

5
00:00:14,913 --> 00:00:17,063
Rym: Yes, we were just at Otakon.

6
00:00:17,124 --> 00:00:22,170
Rym: it ended yesterday Which means we are not going to be able to make a podcast today.

7
00:00:22,391 --> 00:00:26,570
Rym: So we are in fact currently sleeping on the beach somewhere in Wildwood, New Jersey.

8
00:00:27,254 --> 00:00:30,129
Rym: Yeah, if you're in Wildwood, New Jersey feel free to come find us.

9
00:00:30,411 --> 00:00:33,330
Rym: We'll be here for a few more days but regardless.

10
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:47,970
Rym: Previously we offered anyone who had the ability to podcast the opportunity to create their very own GeekNights episode and We had some takers our friends over at simply syndicated who made from the movies.

11
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,827
Rym: You should see podcast which we have appeared on twice.

12
00:00:51,028 --> 00:00:59,130
Rym: yes They like our show so much that they decided to make their own episode of it And this is what you will be hearing very shortly.

13
00:00:59,472 --> 00:01:05,866
Rym: So first off if you are a new listener to GeekNights You may or may not have found us through Otakon and all of the shows and events we did there.

14
00:01:06,027 --> 00:01:13,523
Rym: be sure to check out the website www.frontrowcrew.com And bear in mind that while all this week are going to be GeekNights specials.

15
00:01:13,704 --> 00:01:19,770
Rym: if you want to listen to a more standard Normal episode look for any episode that doesn't have the word special in the title.

16
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,507
Rym: There are about a hundred and sixty of them out there either in iTunes or on the feed or on the website itself.

17
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:36,484
Rym: also if you're Looking for our Otakon coverage It will be beginning next Monday And we'll go for approximately two weeks as we are currently out of town And we don't have the ability to upload let alone edit anything together.

18
00:01:36,825 --> 00:01:52,550
Richard: thus without further ado It's Monday 7th of August and this is GeekNights.

19
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:58,670
Richard: Tonight we'll be discussing stupid dumb Apple fanboys, and why geeks make the best boyfriends.

20
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,028
Alison: Let's do this.

21
00:02:05,632 --> 00:02:08,750

00:02:13,809 --> 00:02:14,792
Alison: okay Let's do that.

25
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:20,490
Richard: so at the beginning you had just heard Rym and Scott explaining that this isn't a normal episode of GeekNights at all.

26
00:02:20,652 --> 00:02:25,762
Richard: You know we are The guest podcasters yeah, and we are part of.

27
00:02:26,143 --> 00:02:26,866
Richard: we're not all of.

28
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:28,230
Richard: we're part of movies.

29
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,989
Richard: You should see Rym and Scott have actually been on our show a couple of times anyway, so the chances are you might hurt them.

30
00:02:33,591 --> 00:02:40,310
Alison: Yeah, hurt us hurt us indeed, so hopefully you did you know because they did some really good spots for us.

31
00:02:40,992 --> 00:02:41,815
Richard: I was pleased with them.

32
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:45,567
Richard: actually last week's show last week's city of God check it out.

33
00:02:45,587 --> 00:02:46,390
Alison: It's a good show.

34
00:02:46,851 --> 00:02:48,035
Richard: We will plug later.

35
00:02:48,236 --> 00:02:48,617
Alison: Okay.

36
00:02:48,637 --> 00:02:52,370
Alison: We'll plug later, but that's those anyway Richard and Alison from movies.

37
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:52,953
Alison: You should see.

38
00:02:53,395 --> 00:02:56,789
Richard: we should say hello to Craig Mike and Tristan who are also part of it.

39
00:02:57,031 --> 00:02:58,076
Alison: Yeah, they are.

40
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,467
Alison: they should have been here tonight, but we have a little mishap.

41
00:03:00,507 --> 00:03:03,437
Alison: yesterday The clutch burn out in the car.

42
00:03:03,457 --> 00:03:06,950
Richard: well basically every one of us who owns a car has had it die in the last two.

43
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,703
Richard: That's right, so nobody's going anywhere, and we didn't want to do this over Skype.

44
00:03:11,064 --> 00:03:11,325
Alison: No.

45
00:03:11,465 --> 00:03:12,589
Richard: No that would have been crap.

46
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:16,940
Richard: so Basically, we're just gonna do a normal episode of GeekNights.

47
00:03:17,221 --> 00:03:19,770
Richard: Yeah excellent so shall we kick off?

48
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:20,232
Alison: We should.

49
00:03:20,593 --> 00:03:22,340
Richard: so we start with the news.

50
00:03:22,942 --> 00:03:25,090
Richard: okay happening well this week.

51
00:03:27,051 --> 00:03:27,954
Richard: Top of the Pops.

52
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:37,099
Richard: yeah a British institution absolutely played its last episode After 42 years, that's the significant thing I suppose.

53
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:43,038
Richard: if you don't know what top of the Pops is it's basically a weekly music show That's been on TV for the last 42 years.

54
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:47,390
Richard: Yeah, where banners go on and they do the top 10 countdown and that sort of thing.

55
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:52,097
Alison: It's basically the the TV equivalent of the chart show they tell us.

56
00:03:52,217 --> 00:03:58,530
Alison: What it's number one on a Sunday and What used to happen is top of the Pops was on a Thursday?

57
00:03:59,232 --> 00:04:04,130
Alison: And it got you geared up and buying records ready for the chart to be announced on Sunday.

58
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:15,970
Alison: so it showed you everybody who's in the chart showed you how many places that had gone up and gone down and It really was something that was really part of my childhood and my teenage years.

59
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:17,394
Richard: I never watched it.

60
00:04:17,454 --> 00:04:21,670
Richard: You know really never once have I sat through an episode of top of the Pops.

61
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:26,327
Alison: It was my entire week the focus of my week when I was a kid like 10 12 years old.

62
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:34,903
Alison: I loved that show and it would be the one thing that was guaranteed that I could watch Uninterrupted in the house.

63
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:44,650
Alison: that was my program, and I think pretty much every teenage girl That type did until something happened in the UK and music started getting really really crap.

64
00:04:45,892 --> 00:04:47,480
Richard: and oh you mean the late 80s?

65
00:04:48,184 --> 00:04:54,201
Richard: well yeah and Actually mainstream music the very late 90s up until now.

66
00:04:54,221 --> 00:05:03,710
Alison: Yeah, we had the Brit pop thing which made everything exciting again and And the MTV thing I guess took quite a bit away from shows like top of the Pops.

67
00:05:04,551 --> 00:05:05,957
Richard: Well, that's what they're saying.

68
00:05:06,017 --> 00:05:10,112
Richard: killed top of the Pops, and I think that's perfectly fair for them to say I think it's fair.

69
00:05:10,313 --> 00:05:15,330
Richard: You know who cares about a once weekly music show when we've got 24-hour music?

70
00:05:15,411 --> 00:05:23,910
Alison: Yeah, you can get to see your favorite videos 25 times a day if you channel serve the right channels And so that kind of led to the demise.

71
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:34,730
Alison: But my favorite days of top of the Pops were back when I was a child because you used to have these Horrific dancers on there were they pans people pans people.

72
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:36,616
Richard: Let's explain about pans people.

73
00:05:36,756 --> 00:05:45,169
Richard: This is a very special part of our history part of our social history British culture, and it's embarrassing it really is.

74
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:49,630
Alison: I'm sure they have kind of equivalent naffness in other countries around the world.

75
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:50,935
Alison: I think we can get away with it.

76
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,283
Richard: There was never naffness to this degree.

77
00:05:53,765 --> 00:06:05,939
Alison: right go on pans people were a group of Young women who were probably aged about 18 to 30 and and they were quite Posh, oh yeah like it.

78
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:07,002
Richard: They were a bit poncy.

79
00:06:07,203 --> 00:06:14,570
Alison: Yeah, they were dancers and Back in the days before video promos were available for pop songs in the charts.

80
00:06:15,032 --> 00:06:21,069
Alison: These women used to come on and do very literal Dancers that were about the song.

81
00:06:22,111 --> 00:06:24,578
Alison: So you got some amazing kind of dancers.

82
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,309
Alison: I can't remember what the song was but it had dogs in it.

83
00:06:29,192 --> 00:06:36,489
Alison: For some reason it had puppies in it or something like that and and sure enough They had puppies on the stage in their dance.

84
00:06:37,033 --> 00:06:43,870
Alison: It was just the most ridiculous thing ever Trying to get these shout suits to stay still while they're doing massive leg kicks and stuff.

85
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:45,089
Alison: It was horrific.

86
00:06:45,732 --> 00:06:52,110
Alison: But I think that everybody loved him because they're a bit sexy really and it was the most leg and body that had ever been.

87
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,677
Richard: Run she's thing on TV at the time by a long way.

88
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,734
Alison: Horrendous costumes.

89
00:06:58,854 --> 00:07:00,179
Richard: Oh, oh, it was horrific.

90
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,010
Richard: You're probably Google pans people and see all of this.

91
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:07,766
Alison: Yeah, I think baby doll 90s and that kind of thing very funny.

92
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:12,842
Alison: You have to see it The facial expressions to go along with this song.

93
00:07:12,903 --> 00:07:14,630
Alison: It's just cheese on a stick.

94
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:20,310
Alison: It really is expertly done, but that's kind of what made top of the pop so special.

95
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,655
Alison: It was a very British thing.

96
00:07:21,716 --> 00:07:25,250
Alison: It was very British dance troupe and it it was just the cream of cheese.

97
00:07:25,471 --> 00:07:26,154
Richard: It really was.

98
00:07:26,676 --> 00:07:27,439
Richard: you see the problem.

99
00:07:27,922 --> 00:07:29,468
Richard: Here's an issue I had with it, right?

100
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:37,220
Richard: The bands that play on top of the pops when they do so-called live Performances and doing the thingies with my fingers.

101
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,430
Richard: this speech marks with my fingers the live performances, right?

102
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,996
Richard: They're not doing live performance.

103
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:44,240
Richard: No, they were at best.

104
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:47,049
Richard: They recorded that performance earlier on in the day.

105
00:07:47,891 --> 00:07:50,098
Richard: But probably and I've seen this a lot.

106
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:51,863
Richard: They sing the album version.

107
00:07:52,164 --> 00:07:53,849
Richard: They've blatantly just brought a CD with them.

108
00:07:54,151 --> 00:07:55,176
Richard: Yeah, something like that, right?

109
00:07:55,578 --> 00:07:58,050
Richard: So they're miming and we know they're miming.

110
00:07:58,671 --> 00:08:06,199
Alison: It's happened by spectacularly on there as well where the dot machines Just gonna just sat there with blank expressions on the faces.

111
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:10,470
Alison: the song plays in the background like what's going on all about Eve.

112
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,995
Alison: That's who it happened to.

113
00:08:12,015 --> 00:08:12,898
Alison: Yeah, brilliant.

114
00:08:13,299 --> 00:08:15,466
Richard: That one's played on TV quite a lot is yeah.

115
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:24,005
Alison: Oh, yeah It's just a nice little Example of the naffness of the program, but they're miming.

116
00:08:24,427 --> 00:08:25,309
Richard: we know they're miming.

117
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:26,617
Richard: They know that.

118
00:08:27,221 --> 00:08:29,490
Richard: we know they're miming right.

119
00:08:30,752 --> 00:08:35,809
Richard: So essentially what it becomes is they're just doing a dance to their song.

120
00:08:36,734 --> 00:08:40,169
Alison: It's kind of we know it's like watching someone play a guitar.

121
00:08:40,491 --> 00:08:41,414
Richard: We know nobody.

122
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:44,206
Richard: we know there's no music being performed in front of us.

123
00:08:44,407 --> 00:08:45,050
Richard: Nothing at all.

124
00:08:45,411 --> 00:08:45,773
Richard: We know.

125
00:08:45,834 --> 00:08:48,589
Richard: essentially what they're doing is dancing for us.

126
00:08:49,031 --> 00:08:57,227
Richard: They're just dancing in a way that look that they're playing at being a band But it's getting 15 year olds a chance to have a look at.

127
00:08:57,247 --> 00:08:58,733
Richard: well That's what it's there.

128
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:05,375
Richard: Is it because the entire studio is there for you pay a fortune to get your song on top of the Pop so that it gets promoted.

129
00:09:05,857 --> 00:09:06,800
Richard: Oh, come on.

130
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,883
Alison: Is it fair to say that?

131
00:09:08,124 --> 00:09:09,909
Richard: Of course, it's perfectly fair to say that.

132
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:16,525
Richard: It's massively fair to say that because when will young one pop idol?

133
00:09:16,746 --> 00:09:24,930
Richard: Oh him there was massive Controversy over the fact that they were trying to pay for him to have two songs on the same episode, which no one has ever done.

134
00:09:25,871 --> 00:09:27,195
Alison: Was that a double-a-side job II?

135
00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:28,560
Richard: that was yes, right.

136
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,061
Alison: Okay.

137
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,766
Alison: He wants to get married actually.

138
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:31,629
Richard: Oh, let him.

139
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:33,074
Alison: That's what I say.

140
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:33,777
Alison: Yeah, what's the?

141
00:09:33,817 --> 00:09:34,459
Alison: do an album?

142
00:09:34,901 --> 00:09:37,470
Richard: We should explain for anyone that doesn't know Williams gay.

143
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:41,989
Richard: So getting there is an unusual, but he's allowed to do that here, which is special.

144
00:09:43,811 --> 00:09:44,413
Richard: Where were we?

145
00:09:44,473 --> 00:09:51,598
Richard: so yeah, so everyone who's on it is doing a little dance for us right from Christina Aguilera To the Gallagher brothers in Oasis.

146
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:54,330
Richard: They're just doing a little dance for us, which is weird.

147
00:09:54,911 --> 00:10:00,425
Richard: I find that weird because again, we all know that but we pretend that they're playing live.

148
00:10:00,786 --> 00:10:10,570
Alison: Yeah, I guess Which is just crazy and always kind of made me want to buy songs a little bit more When I'd seen them, I want to see the videos.

149
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:24,250
Alison: When videos first came out, they were amazing and you got to see things like oh god dire straits The MTV one, you know the money for nothing which was just the most amazing thing in the world when it came.

150
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,256
Richard: There was nothing like that being seen.

151
00:10:26,296 --> 00:10:31,577
Alison: so so we started replacing pop stars with videos and you wouldn't get as many live Performances at.

152
00:10:31,638 --> 00:10:32,750
Alison: well not live.

153
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:35,176
Alison: You get a video.

154
00:10:35,577 --> 00:10:38,910
Alison: you kind of felt a little while after you were being a little bit cheated.

155
00:10:39,432 --> 00:10:49,684
Richard: You actually want to see the band videos of the biggest cheat in the music industry Bar nothing because they're advertising to get you to buy the single.

156
00:10:49,985 --> 00:10:51,790
Richard: and now we're paying for videos.

157
00:10:51,972 --> 00:10:56,645
Richard: Yeah, we're paying to buy Advertising to make us buy something else.

158
00:10:56,665 --> 00:10:57,450
Alison: It's crazy.

159
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:02,610
Alison: I'd much rather see a performer actually mime in front of me then see the same video.

160
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:05,994
Richard: Dance for me.

161
00:11:06,074 --> 00:11:06,395
Richard: come on.

162
00:11:06,856 --> 00:11:07,859
Richard: Yeah, that's what we need.

163
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:12,070
Alison: I think you know in America with was it Dick Clark in America?

164
00:11:12,212 --> 00:11:20,490
Alison: he had like a show kind of like that whether you have a Band on and they come and play in front of a live studio audience and then you get to see it at home.

165
00:11:20,835 --> 00:11:29,579
Alison: It's kind of like, you know Just a live pop show and the only thing that we've got like that now in this country is like Jules Holland And he's not playing pop.

166
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,733
Richard: He's playing the stuff jazz and blues Good stuff.

167
00:11:33,814 --> 00:11:35,320
Alison: Yeah, the good stuff good stuff.

168
00:11:35,822 --> 00:11:36,986
Alison: My thing is right.

169
00:11:37,026 --> 00:11:40,249
Alison: when I was a child I thought I'd always loved Top of the Pops.

170
00:11:40,912 --> 00:11:45,745
Alison: No, I did because I thought this this rules and this is where music is.

171
00:11:45,825 --> 00:11:49,028
Alison: no, I mean, no you haven't always loved it I haven't always loved it.

172
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:54,810
Alison: I fell out of love with it when I started thinking I can't cope with British pop culture.

173
00:11:58,812 --> 00:12:00,536
Alison: Yeah, I think that's what's done it.

174
00:12:00,656 --> 00:12:07,233
Richard: in a final nail in the coffin in a program that only plays music you'd governed by What music's out.

175
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:07,635
Richard: that's.

176
00:12:07,735 --> 00:12:10,604
Richard: if there's nothing good out there's nothing you can play and nothing you can do.

177
00:12:11,226 --> 00:12:20,049
Richard: so maybe again Simon Cowell the root of all evil in the universe where the shit pop music has destroyed Top of the Pops.

178
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:25,250
Richard: if You trace every bad thing in the universe that happens it goes back to Simon Cowell.

179
00:12:27,092 --> 00:12:28,357
Alison: You really don't like him.

180
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:35,850
Richard: everything everything pick anything you want I will trace it back to Simon Cowell and the decline of the British pop music industry.

181
00:12:36,051 --> 00:12:37,896
Alison: Yeah, definitely very orange.

182
00:12:38,739 --> 00:12:41,126
Richard: He is and his waistband is far too high.

183
00:12:41,146 --> 00:12:41,627
Alison: That's right.

184
00:12:41,707 --> 00:12:47,637
Alison: And he's a No I just opposed him generally and everything about him, but enough enough.

185

Richard: Jimmy Saville, sir Jimmy said night of the realm who?

187
00:13:12,706 --> 00:13:20,490
Alison: He's the first man to get two turntables and Put two records on and try and play them simultaneously.

188
00:13:21,753 --> 00:13:24,430
Alison: So he's the first ever proper turntable DJ.

189
00:13:25,092 --> 00:13:28,704
Alison: it lasted for one song and the entire equipment blew up.

190
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:34,101
Alison: and it was Upstairs at the Otley working men's club in Leeds.

191
00:13:34,482 --> 00:13:37,291
Alison: Yeah, and it happened in 1962.

00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:38,555
Alison: I believe that's amazing.

193
00:13:38,575 --> 00:13:40,742
Alison: So for that reason alone, Jimmy Saville.

00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:51,240

Richard: I'm being overly cautious.

260
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:23,221
Alison: Oh This little video is entitled collaboration 2001.

261
00:17:23,221 --> 00:17:26,089

262
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:28,117
Richard: Okay, that's good.

263
00:17:28,137 --> 00:17:34,115
Alison: Right and And and 2001. there's quite a few files on there from collaboration.

264
00:17:34,135 --> 00:17:48,560
Alison: It seems to me I don't really know but it looks like a Korean sort of youth culture festival Korean American youth culture festival Where they go and they do street dance and that kind of thing and generally have a good time and show off their mad skills.

265
00:17:49,593 --> 00:17:56,400
Alison: and this little clip is of Three guys who do some body popping.

266
00:17:57,481 --> 00:17:59,287
Richard: It's yeah, it's body popping.

267
00:17:59,448 --> 00:18:01,274
Richard: Yeah, that's what we call it.

268
00:18:01,816 --> 00:18:02,077
Alison: Is it?

269
00:18:02,398 --> 00:18:04,704
Richard: I don't know Robotic dancing.

270
00:18:05,206 --> 00:18:08,400
Alison: I'm calling it body popping because I don't know what else to call it.

271
00:18:08,581 --> 00:18:20,200
Richard: You see we say body popping and I think Back in the 80s with all the pop in the color Which is a little bit of it is in there, but this is a master class.

272
00:18:20,521 --> 00:18:23,455
Alison: There's two guys who were on first and you think they're all right.

273
00:18:23,515 --> 00:18:24,460
Alison: You think they're pretty good.

274
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:36,929
Alison: They've got some moves and stuff and then this guy called Nathan from Santa Anna Comes on and just throws down the maddest moves I've ever seen a human being contort themselves into.

275
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:40,419
Richard: this is certainly something that has to be seen to be believed.

276
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:43,540
Alison: Yeah I think the guy's body is amazing.

277
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:53,457
Alison: He can command it to do pretty much what he wants to do and he goes up from being like a solid piece of wood To something that's liquid and melting.

278
00:18:53,477 --> 00:19:04,992
Alison: He's Absolutely astounding and I've seen it so many times now, but the guy just makes me go Every time I see it, it's awesome.

279
00:19:05,474 --> 00:19:06,980
Richard: It is it's just amazing.

280
00:19:07,382 --> 00:19:10,560
Richard: I want to say something more intelligent about it than it's just amazing.

281
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:16,440
Richard: You do get the feeling that this kid might have been in some kind of accident or something.

282
00:19:20,443 --> 00:19:33,737
Richard: I can understand the how I can't make my body do the robot bit and the dancing Yeah, but when he just try when he just puts himself into a position like when he does that bit with his shoulders Yeah, I think well, why can't I do that?

283
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,149
Richard: Cuz what is it about your body that mine doesn't have?

284
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,815
Richard: or mine has that yours doesn't?

285
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:40,039
Alison: I don't know.

Alison: You'll know it when you see it that he kind of makes like there's something underneath his jumper.

288
00:19:48,461 --> 00:19:49,504
Richard: See, that's clever.

289
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:50,889
Richard: That's skillful.

290
00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:51,490
Richard: I get that.

291
00:19:51,531 --> 00:19:52,654
Richard: I can't do that.

292
00:19:52,674 --> 00:19:53,737
Richard: I'm happy with that.

293
00:19:53,778 --> 00:19:56,645
Richard: That's okay But you know the bit.

294
00:19:56,806 --> 00:19:58,211
Richard: why can his body do things?

00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,946
Alison: That's a shocking thing about this guy.

302
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:10,230
Richard: Maybe that's what it is.

303
00:20:10,471 --> 00:20:13,642
Richard: I'm just too old and creaky and sort of Arthritis II.

304

00:22:13,405 --> 00:22:17,097
Alison: I got a video camera from somewhere and I say I don't think they're middle-class.

340
00:22:17,117 --> 00:22:18,060
Richard: you see I look at them.

341
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,574
Richard: I think your mum's an accountant your dad is a doctor and you don't like it.

342
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:24,360
Alison: You see I don't get that at all.

343
00:22:24,642 --> 00:22:33,736
Alison: I get parents are divorced Dad's not at home They're doing spliffs and fat since they were about 12.

347
00:22:45,216 --> 00:22:45,798
Alison: Yes, dear.

348
00:22:45,818 --> 00:22:46,019
Alison: Really?

349
00:22:47,621 --> 00:22:49,206
Alison: It's all kids like them.

350
00:22:49,246 --> 00:22:51,272
Alison: Let's say that kids very like them.

351
00:22:51,753 --> 00:22:59,875
Alison: Mmm, because we're talking about a particular subset of British culture here that is known as a chav We should explain the chav.

352
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:00,299
Alison: We should.

353
00:23:01,343 --> 00:23:04,143
Alison: There's a really really good website Call.

354
00:23:04,203 --> 00:23:19,206
Alison: Oh, yeah chav town.com that chav chav chav and it will tell you all about what a chav is what they wear how they speak where they go what they buy and the rest of it.

355
00:23:19,327 --> 00:23:28,240
Alison: it's an entire subculture and These choice young gentlemen that you have a particularly fine examples of breed.

356
00:23:29,289 --> 00:23:30,924
Richard: Yes It's.

357
00:23:31,085 --> 00:23:32,714
Richard: it's part of believing that.

358
00:23:33,438 --> 00:23:38,315
Richard: well Maybe that you're better at something than you perhaps are.

359
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:45,960
Alison: I think It's a striving of getting out of the crappy shitty life that you live because let's not make any bonds about it.

360
00:23:46,221 --> 00:23:51,840
Alison: I think these guys are poor and I think they come from a poor background and it's about striving to get out.

361
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:53,684
Richard: We've not even said what they do yet.

362
00:23:54,105 --> 00:23:54,807
Richard: That's my fault.

363
00:23:54,948 --> 00:23:55,449
Richard: I apologise.

364
00:23:55,469 --> 00:23:56,050
Alison: This is funny.

365
00:23:56,231 --> 00:23:57,414
Alison: They're rapping.

366
00:23:57,594 --> 00:24:00,864
Richard: It's basically a video of three kids Rapping.

367
00:24:00,904 --> 00:24:04,640
Richard: they're called the kersal massive k-e-r-s-a-l massive.

368
00:24:05,881 --> 00:24:09,154
Richard: They're three of them and in actual fact they're quite, that's massive.

369
00:24:09,174 --> 00:24:10,700
Richard: They're quite small as well.

370
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,630
Richard: Yeah, I mean especially what's his name?

371
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,480
Alison: little Kev not Kev our little Kev.

372
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:19,439
Alison: He's about 12 so we can deduce from the little video that we've got.

373
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:30,360
Richard: but this is a prime example of what happens when you give everyone a voice and As wonderful a thing as that is that we have the freedom in the world for everyone to have a voice.

374
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:35,920
Richard: We realize perhaps that not many people have a great deal to say yet say it anyway.

375
00:24:36,603 --> 00:24:38,855
Richard: Yeah, that's that's what this shows.

376
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:47,511
Richard: I think You know, I get the whole being poor and rapping your way out of the ghetto Whatever not that they live in a ghetto.

377
00:24:47,672 --> 00:24:49,540
Alison: These guys are not three M&Ms.

378
00:24:52,162 --> 00:24:56,354
Richard: M&M can do such a thing because the man is actually to be fair.

379
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:59,806
Richard: whether you write like rap music or not He's shit out of what he does.

380
00:24:59,947 --> 00:25:01,714
Richard: Yeah, you know, I couldn't do that.

381
00:25:01,815 --> 00:25:02,839
Richard: He's not in a million years.

382
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:04,693
Richard: There you go.

383
00:25:04,734 --> 00:25:05,379
Richard: You've got my time.

384
00:25:06,143 --> 00:25:09,440
Alison: These guys do this isn't M&M style rap?

385
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:23,392
Alison: This isn't like that kind of American twang rap that you know, no these guys are rapping with black British accents Which just makes it even funnier cuz they're talking in it.

386
00:25:23,573 --> 00:25:26,000
Alison: Is it all that kind of crap?

387
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,740
Richard: This is this is part of the most annoying thing that is happening in this country at the moment.

388
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:36,240
Richard: Is this this overbearing need to respond to any part of conversation with the words?

389
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:36,921
Richard: Is it?

390
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:38,707
Richard: is it hello?

391
00:25:38,928 --> 00:25:42,039
Richard: Is it no what it's always questions.

392
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:51,927
Alison: Example was that girl when I asked her where she worked and she says I'll work on one just the road daughter Dora, I don't know.

393
00:25:52,088 --> 00:25:52,530
Alison: I don't know.

394
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,213
Alison: I asked you.

395
00:25:53,233 --> 00:25:58,413
Alison: weird anyway But that's the kind of language that these kids talking.

396
00:25:58,534 --> 00:26:01,844
Alison: it's not like an American rappers Hip-hop accent.

397
00:26:02,386 --> 00:26:06,360
Alison: It's black British hip-hop accent, and it's very silly.

398
00:26:06,701 --> 00:26:09,796
Richard: Well, the thing that winds me up about it is that it's totally made up.

399
00:26:11,044 --> 00:26:25,259
Richard: It's not like it is completely Made up and it's not like these people actually have these accents or actually come from a culture like that In the backseat, yeah, cuz I ain't they're not even old enough to drive a car.

400
00:26:25,762 --> 00:26:31,124
Alison: Yeah, they're talking about the mom's clear at one point and I mean we're talking Shop a car.

408
00:26:54,142 --> 00:26:59,667
Richard: I was that guy and actually as per Either Rima Scott's recommendation.

00:29:01,592 --> 00:29:06,015
Richard: There was a little kid outside the shop and he was Little roly-poly kid.

448

Richard: And I said no look if you don't drink beer, you'll lose weight and girls will like you And you won't need to drink beer anymore with him who quite frankly looks like he's been sipping antifreeze.

454
00:29:32,496 --> 00:29:37,576
Richard: No one's gonna say to these kids Because you're the little chubby kid.

455
00:29:37,777 --> 00:29:45,600
Richard: I get it I was a little chubby kid but drinking beer outside a Convenience store is not gonna help.

456

Richard: No, that's not gonna get you.

457
00:29:47,126 --> 00:29:48,230
Alison: Anyway, it's just really annoying.

458
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:54,229
Richard: it is not the way to advance your life and Somebody needs to make this very clear to you now.

459

Alison: Yeah, I was an eight.

498
00:32:13,224 --> 00:32:16,500

Richard: you do But you know, there's I would be fair to say this far geekier than me.

509
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:43,360
Richard: There's no comic books in the toilet.

510
00:32:43,683 --> 00:32:45,300
Alison: We met a geek a few weeks ago.

00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,653
Alison: Can you remember he had like one of every computer.

512
00:32:49,156 --> 00:32:50,180
Richard: that was incredible?

Alison: Was uber geek though, wasn't he?

514
00:32:55,288 --> 00:32:58,500
Richard: Yeah, we found ourselves in this guy's house for one reason or another.

515
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:01,176
Richard: We were seeing a friend of ours who was in his house.

516
00:33:01,236 --> 00:33:06,335
Richard: Yeah And this guy we start talking and he's like you like computers.

517
00:33:06,997 --> 00:33:07,699
Richard: Oh, yeah.

518
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,560
Richard: Well, you've got to see these.

519
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:17,580
Richard: Oh One of every computer ever made pretty much most of them worked as well.

520
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:25,002
Alison: he just kept getting another one out and another one out and it'd be like from 1982 and 1987.

521
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:30,497
Richard: he had every Nintendo ever and they were all plugged in and working in his living room.

522
00:33:30,517 --> 00:33:32,088
Alison: Yeah, we were playing Donkey Kong Weren't we?

523
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,003
Alison: Yeah Fantastic.

524
00:33:34,023 --> 00:33:36,554
Alison: I mean that guy plays World of Warcraft.

00:33:37,036 --> 00:33:37,800
Alison: He's got the beard.

526
00:33:38,669 --> 00:33:39,540
Alison: He's got the anime.

527
00:33:40,323 --> 00:33:44,075
Alison: He had the most anime I've ever seen in one place at any one time.

528
00:33:44,115 --> 00:33:50,259
Richard: to be fair looking at him Where he wish to walk into a comic book store in Springfield and find him sat behind the counter.

529
00:33:52,101 --> 00:33:59,940
Richard: Now actually I my ex when I got my xbox chipped a couple of years ago The guy who did it actually was comic book guy.

530
00:34:00,261 --> 00:34:04,200
Richard: He was this big fat guy sat on the barstool behind the counter in the game show.

531
00:34:05,221 --> 00:34:09,620
Richard: He had even had the greasy ponytail and the beard and everything.

532
00:34:10,643 --> 00:34:11,688
Richard: It was fantastic.

533
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:17,935
Richard: He I can't remember what it was about But he even connected corrected my pronunciation of a technical term.

534
00:34:18,476 --> 00:34:18,998
Richard: I was in there.

535
00:34:20,081 --> 00:34:21,346
Richard: He was comic book guy.

536
00:34:21,746 --> 00:34:24,335
Richard: and you just want to say to these guys like cuz you must know.

537
00:34:24,355 --> 00:34:26,159
Richard: Yeah, he's seen The Simpsons.

538
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,851
Richard: He's seen comic book guy.

539
00:34:29,112 --> 00:34:36,780
Richard: He can probably quote every episode to me And so he must know he must sit there looking at himself at the screen at himself.

540
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,007
Alison: Do you know who I think I am?

541
00:34:38,089 --> 00:34:39,317
Alison: Comic book guy.

542
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:40,824
Richard: maybe Episode ever.

543
00:34:41,326 --> 00:34:43,976
Richard: Why are we doing bad Simpsons Impressions?

544
00:34:44,036 --> 00:34:44,800
Richard: I can't do Impressions.

545
00:34:46,003 --> 00:34:48,693
Richard: So we're talking about dumb Apple fanboys.

546
00:34:48,975 --> 00:34:49,958
Alison: We're talking about you.

547
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:55,158
Richard: This is a unique phenomenon within the technical industry.

548
00:34:55,217 --> 00:35:00,185
Richard: I believe in that Every company has its fans.

549
00:35:00,687 --> 00:35:01,027
Richard: every at.

550
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:06,020
Richard: every company who makes stuff has people who only buy people who are brand loyal.

551
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:07,606
Richard: We know what.

552
00:35:07,726 --> 00:35:10,557
Richard: Mike for example only has Sony stuff in his room.

553
00:35:10,898 --> 00:35:11,460
Alison: That's true.

554
00:35:11,701 --> 00:35:19,840
Richard: I keep trying to tell him that Sony are and the second force of all evil Other than Simon Cowell, but he keeps buying it because it's all already there and he likes it to match.

555
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:23,880
Richard: But Apple fanboys are a law unto themselves.

556
00:35:24,863 --> 00:35:30,500
Alison: This is very very true and something that is is becoming more apparent to me the longer I live with you.

557
00:35:31,722 --> 00:35:31,862
Richard: Now.

558
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:33,328
Richard: I wasn't always like this.

559
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:34,653
Richard: It has to be said.

560
00:35:34,673 --> 00:35:36,260
Alison: I know you caught a bug.

561
00:35:36,783 --> 00:35:39,950
Richard: I caught a bug about a year and a half ago I think.

562
00:35:40,030 --> 00:36:07,615
Richard: cuz I work in a production company and when we all got together to begin with out of the four of us three of us worked on PCs religiously and there was Luke who had a Mac and At the time it was this weird little g3 blue Purple kind of rather girly affair that didn't really do anything and compared to the PC I had at the time it was well shit quite frankly and it crashed all the time.

563
00:36:08,036 --> 00:36:12,580
Richard: recently we have Smashed it up with a big bat, which was quite sad.

564
00:36:13,725 --> 00:36:14,187
Richard: No, we didn't.

565
00:36:14,247 --> 00:36:17,260
Richard: we should have done that actually and put it on YouTube with this slew of other.

566
00:36:17,562 --> 00:36:19,540
Richard: Yeah, watch me smash my Mac videos.

567
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:24,415
Richard: But I think it was also then hurled off something big tired of being fun.

568
00:36:24,676 --> 00:36:25,217
Richard: It was fun.

569
00:36:25,438 --> 00:36:28,305
Richard: Yeah I've lost track now.

570
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:36,517
Richard: the g3 sat in the corner of the office the g3 sat in the corner of the office And then we we sort of bought our own or all our new equipment.

571
00:36:36,618 --> 00:36:43,020
Richard: Yeah, and Part of that was brand new spanky g5 power Mac that one that's up right there.

572
00:36:43,221 --> 00:36:52,376
Richard: No, that was that's my one the one in the office The new one and this was unlike anything I had ever seen before in my life.

573
00:36:52,837 --> 00:36:59,420
Richard: actually for the first six months We sort of we were speaking behind each of those backs about Luke going, you know, we've got to get him on to PCs.

574
00:36:59,621 --> 00:37:01,006
Richard: What's this Mac shit?

575
00:37:01,528 --> 00:37:02,251
Richard: He's got going on.

576
00:37:02,432 --> 00:37:05,993
Richard: We can't be having this, you know I don't care how compatible is.

577
00:37:06,195 --> 00:37:07,202
Richard: don't want it Don't want it.

578
00:37:07,242 --> 00:37:17,045
Richard: got to get more and then I used it and three days and nights later I was physically removed from it because other work had to be done on it and that was pretty much it.

579
00:37:17,787 --> 00:37:27,975
Richard: and then those of you who have bought one will probably relate to the Stories of going to the Apple Store page over and over again building your ideal spec.

580
00:37:28,396 --> 00:37:28,897
Alison: Oh, yes.

581
00:37:28,917 --> 00:37:31,723
Alison: I remember this Clearly.

582
00:37:31,904 --> 00:37:35,760
Richard: do I get the slightly bigger hard drive or the bigger graphics card?

583
00:37:37,061 --> 00:37:40,853
Alison: I can recall one night when you sat here and did that very task.

584
00:37:41,355 --> 00:37:50,920
Alison: over and over again over and over again We were coming up with figures that were near 12,000 pounds or that was my dream system was your dream system and you were really going for it.

585
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:54,197
Alison: you're going for the top end of everything and every add-on that you could get.

586
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:58,679
Alison: that was New and zippy and I want I still do that.

587
00:37:59,061 --> 00:37:59,644
Richard: I still do it.

588
00:37:59,866 --> 00:38:02,700
Richard: only my ideal system is now sixteen and a half thousand pounds.

589
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,770
Richard: That's just which is crazy for a computer.

590
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:07,375
Richard: I mean really what does it do?

591
00:38:07,495 --> 00:38:08,860
Richard: Is it that much faster than mine?

592
00:38:09,441 --> 00:38:10,605
Richard: Probably not to be fair.

593
00:38:10,785 --> 00:38:12,069
Alison: You can buy cars for that.

594
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:13,734
Alison: You can buy nice car.

595
00:38:13,754 --> 00:38:15,880
Richard: You can buy houses for that in some places.

596
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,602
Richard: Let's be honest.

597
00:38:16,663 --> 00:38:16,964
Richard: Yeah.

598
00:38:17,365 --> 00:38:19,191
Alison: Yeah, you can which is ridiculous.

599
00:38:19,232 --> 00:38:21,520
Richard: Do I buy a power Mac or a house?

600
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:28,026
Alison: Well given where that house would be in a really crummy area I'd actually get the Mac again.

601
00:38:28,387 --> 00:38:31,558
Richard: get the Mac and you can live in them as well.

602
00:38:31,618 --> 00:38:32,180
Richard: They're that big.

603
00:38:32,281 --> 00:38:34,340
Richard: They've got a bedroom on sweet.

604
00:38:34,724 --> 00:38:35,128
Alison: They don't.

605
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,406
Richard: The next one will have.

606
00:38:37,426 --> 00:38:38,009
Alison: no they don't.

607
00:38:38,551 --> 00:38:39,697
Richard: Steve will bring it for me.

608
00:38:39,978 --> 00:38:40,320
Alison: He won't.

609
00:38:41,262 --> 00:38:47,673
Richard: so let's talk some more about How this is, you know, the more I'm talking about it.

610
00:38:47,733 --> 00:38:49,680
Richard: I'm actually starting to feel ashamed of myself.

611
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:55,219
Alison: Oh, yeah, you see I was hoping that this might come out because this is good therapy for is it?

612
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:00,084
Richard: This is gonna make us stronger as a couple I'm hoping so.

613
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:07,259
Alison: maybe I'm hoping so because we're gonna both get to air outside of the story And you're going to realize that you're quite sad.

614
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:11,632
Richard: Well, let's explain how it starts because as I say, I wasn't always like this.

615
00:39:11,752 --> 00:39:14,400
Richard: it starts with seeing it for the first time.

616
00:39:14,621 --> 00:39:16,849
Alison: Yeah, it is a rather beautiful machine.

617
00:39:16,869 --> 00:39:18,956
Richard: No, I don't want to get into the whole.

618
00:39:18,976 --> 00:39:20,040
Richard: I think they're brilliant.

619
00:39:20,181 --> 00:39:21,468
Richard: So you should go out and buy one.

620
00:39:21,488 --> 00:39:25,149
Richard: I'm not I don't want to talk about you that a lot Yeah, but I'm not in this case.

621
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:31,320
Richard: I'm just talking about the experience of being The dumb fanboy rather that I'm not I don't want to get into which is better.

622
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,947
Alison: Just explain what it's like when you look at that.

623
00:39:34,987 --> 00:39:46,840
Richard: so for me you start building it and then it starts because You get yours and then something else comes out and you think well Wish I got that one because that's happened to you already.

624
00:39:46,961 --> 00:39:48,700
Richard: That's happened to a lot of people already.

625
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:56,520
Richard: There was Craig who bought his g5 and then the week after the new one came out Yeah, and then my dad bought one of those and then the week after the Intel one came out.

626
00:39:57,042 --> 00:39:59,329
Richard: Two very upset people who are now very happy.

627
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:02,480
Alison: you see that that marks on the downside for Apple.

628
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,513
Alison: I think the quick no, no, no, no, no, that's.

629
00:40:05,614 --> 00:40:07,120
Richard: that's completely unfair.

630
00:40:07,401 --> 00:40:12,640
Richard: How often do you let Packard release a computer with the next Intel processor in?

631
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,865
Richard: How often do they all do that?

632
00:40:15,186 --> 00:40:25,028
Richard: We only know with Apple because there's there's like two different machines and because Everybody watches them so closely Fools like me.

633
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:31,735
Richard: this is that the key RSS feed Updating every 30 minutes linked to Mac daily news.

634
00:40:31,836 --> 00:40:38,135
Richard: This is the key Richard Yeah to get rumors about things that are never ever gonna happen.

635
00:40:38,576 --> 00:40:38,857
Alison: Yeah.

636
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:46,473
Richard: Oh And it's just stupid made-up things that make the news and we get so excited But you look at them and you just go straight away.

637
00:40:46,513 --> 00:40:47,499
Alison: Well, that's not real.

638
00:40:48,102 --> 00:40:49,968
Richard: I know I do that but then I get excited.

639
00:40:50,409 --> 00:40:52,175
Richard: This is what's so stupid about it.

640
00:40:52,536 --> 00:40:53,740
Richard: I'm not a dumb person.

641
00:40:53,901 --> 00:40:59,978
Richard: I can I can read things and decide and well think with education that that's stupid.

642
00:41:00,139 --> 00:41:02,607
Alison: and You see the rabbit and you start running.

643
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:03,049
Richard: you want it.

644
00:41:05,965 --> 00:41:07,542
Richard: Yeah It's just like this.

645
00:41:07,663 --> 00:41:26,300
Richard: this latest one about the phone where there's this news report came out that this guy who knows a guy who's a Technology did a photo shoot for Apple allegedly and Allegedly photoed what he just described as the best-looking phone he's ever seen in his life.

646
00:41:26,964 --> 00:41:29,119
Richard: But it's probably a complete load of toss.

647
00:41:29,421 --> 00:41:32,312
Alison: But what did you say there was in the car going?

648
00:41:32,332 --> 00:41:34,480
Richard: I know it's probably not true, but it's coming.

649
00:41:34,541 --> 00:41:35,739
Richard: That means it's coming next.

650
00:41:38,687 --> 00:41:40,773
Richard: What the hell is this about what?

651
00:41:40,853 --> 00:41:42,256
Richard: how does it happen what?

652
00:41:42,677 --> 00:41:43,660
Richard: what has it done to me?

653
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:49,778
Alison: You've got that nice silver shiny beautiful box there and I'm going to agree with you.

654
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:52,968
Alison: it's Aesthetically a beautiful machine.

655
00:41:53,109 --> 00:42:00,918
Alison: Oh when you turn it on the screens are beautiful and You've got that and then you realize it's a beautiful thing.

656
00:42:01,842 --> 00:42:11,196
Alison: And beautiful things are very intoxicating and you want more beautiful things, especially when the beautiful thing looks rather beautiful Alongside the other beautiful things.

657
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:22,970
Alison: Yeah And then they bring out another beautiful thing that is equally beautiful alongside both of those beautiful things and suddenly have to have every beautiful thing that has an Apple logo stamped on it.

658
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:27,918
Richard: and then they give you stickers so that you can put Apple logos on Things that shouldn't have Apple logos on them.

659
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:28,782
Alison: Yeah What we got?

660
00:42:28,822 --> 00:42:34,520
Alison: we got a little girly pink paper box on the mantelpiece that's got an Apple sticker on it.

661
00:42:34,764 --> 00:42:35,418
Alison: I put it there.

662
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:40,435
Alison: I am not infected by the Apple pug, but I put that sticker on that there box.

663
00:42:40,615 --> 00:42:42,060
Richard: Frank has an Apple guitar.

664
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:45,804
Alison: No, he doesn't Gibson guitar.

665
00:42:45,824 --> 00:42:47,168
Alison: it's got an Apple sticker on it.

666
00:42:47,569 --> 00:42:48,533
Alison: What why?

667
00:42:48,553 --> 00:42:49,275
Richard: I don't know.

668
00:42:50,419 --> 00:42:51,343
Richard: I don't know I can't tell you.

669
00:42:51,363 --> 00:42:54,379
Alison: I you know, his people are getting Apple tattoos.

670
00:42:55,082 --> 00:42:57,030
Richard: Now that's too fast too far.

671
00:42:57,592 --> 00:43:01,546
Richard: You see if you come back here with no Tattoo no, it's not gonna happen.

672
00:43:01,807 --> 00:43:03,231
Alison: Yeah, they'll be trouble.

673
00:43:03,412 --> 00:43:06,100
Richard: I'd expect to be kicked out for that to be perfectly honest.

674
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:11,237
Alison: But oh, yeah, you know, yeah, I'm glad you've realized what's coming to you before so you've got.

675
00:43:11,337 --> 00:43:12,180
Richard: no I wouldn't do it.

676
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:19,232
Richard: I don't want that because the moment I get it done is the moment they bring out the I poo and Stock prices crash through the floor.

677
00:43:19,272 --> 00:43:19,775
Richard: and that's it.

678
00:43:20,057 --> 00:43:20,439
Alison: That's it.

679
00:43:20,801 --> 00:43:24,876
Richard: Although I think they could actually bring out the I poo and it would sell in its millions.

680
00:43:24,916 --> 00:43:31,172
Richard: just to poo in a box With an Apple logo on Probably would people wouldn't buy one and people would dismantle it and go.

681
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:34,723
Richard: there's clues to the new Apple phone in the firmware of the I poo, but

682
00:43:34,763 --> 00:43:44,200
Alison: the interesting thing is that before you bought it we drive 45 miles to the nearest Apple store for you to look at it in that glass box

683
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:44,300
Richard: and

684
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:48,173
Alison: Fawn over it until you've got enough money to afford

685
00:43:48,234 --> 00:43:48,294
Richard: it.

686
00:43:48,615 --> 00:43:52,788
Richard: It's not my fault That the only Apple store is 45 miles away.

687
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:54,332
Alison: It's the fawning.

688
00:43:54,593 --> 00:43:55,435
Alison: It's not the journey.

689
00:43:55,515 --> 00:43:57,300
Richard: Okay, it's on the other side of the pen lines.

690
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,605
Alison: I have no money in my pocket.

691
00:43:59,046 --> 00:44:01,555
Alison: I want deeply what is in that store.

692
00:44:01,575 --> 00:44:02,820
Richard: So I'm just gonna go and stroke one.

693
00:44:03,225 --> 00:44:04,180
Alison: I'm gonna go stroke it.

694
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:10,200
Alison: I'm gonna look at it fawn and then walk away and go and have a look in game see what secondhand games have got.

695
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,999
Alison: Yeah, because that's your other geek spot on that trip.

696
00:44:14,762 --> 00:44:22,248
Richard: That's half over because that was part of a quest to find an Xbox version of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 And you've got a very old game.

697
00:44:22,529 --> 00:44:30,180
Richard: and are you telling me now that oh, yeah The quest is half over but as soon as I get a copy of fusion frenzy, we can all relax?

698
00:44:30,962 --> 00:44:36,779
Alison: Are you telling me that when you've got fusion frenzy the frequency of your visits into not one?

699
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:42,951
Alison: Branch two branches of game with two branches of game in the same mall Are going to reduce?

700
00:44:43,253 --> 00:44:45,964
Richard: yes, I promise You promise.

701
00:44:45,984 --> 00:44:47,730
Alison: did you hear that everyone everyone?

702
00:44:47,971 --> 00:44:50,440
Alison: This is being recorded on the 7th of all.

703
00:44:50,825 --> 00:44:53,886
Richard: Don't be so Yeah, I promise.

704
00:44:54,187 --> 00:44:56,096
Richard: Yeah, and I'll stop reading my daily news.

705
00:44:56,417 --> 00:44:59,752
Richard: Yeah You see this all hit home for me right.

Alison: Get a Mac.

712
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:24,389
Richard: to the point where when I went to the Apple store last time to get my iPod sorted Which is another thing we'll talk about.

713
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:36,980
Richard: Yeah, I said to the guy behind the counter, you know I should get commission for all the max I sold and he looked at me In the most deadpan way and said have you any idea how many times I hear that every day?

714
00:45:37,623 --> 00:45:39,899
Alison: Yeah, well then there's more than you.

Richard: That since January I have had three.

720

Richard: No, that's three because three of them broken.

722
00:46:11,052 --> 00:46:13,500
Richard: That's why they haven't been dropped down the toilet.

723
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,548
Richard: They haven't been smashed or driven over the car.

724
00:46:15,869 --> 00:46:17,956

Richard: Yeah, so I don't know what it does.

735
00:46:56,512 --> 00:46:59,379
Richard: I don't think it's simply using them.

736
00:47:00,242 --> 00:47:00,804
Richard: That does it.

737
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:03,914
Richard: First of all, I don't think it actually pleases that many people.

738
00:47:03,955 --> 00:47:10,306
Richard: I think you know as even rimming Scott have said There's massive problems there.

739
00:47:10,647 --> 00:47:14,139
Richard: I think I would agree not with the iPod with the max now, right?

740
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:16,358

Richard: Did you feel how hot the kitchen?

746
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:32,494
Richard: You could have just fried an egg on the work Something out of Ghostbusters.

747
00:47:32,514 --> 00:47:33,359
Richard: You could have just done that.

748
00:47:33,881 --> 00:47:37,255
Alison: I don't know how long you've been using it for but it can't be however long.

749
00:47:37,676 --> 00:47:38,600
Richard: that was ridiculous.

750
00:47:38,942 --> 00:47:42,379
Richard: If that had been on your lap, you'd have been rubbing some aloe vera on there.

751
00:47:42,862 --> 00:47:45,900
Richard: Yeah, and believe you me that can lead to some nasty injuries.

752
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,999
Richard: If I had to pick an area of my body to burn my lap wouldn't be it?

753
00:47:50,441 --> 00:47:54,820
Alison: Well, your testicles are such a great area to be heating up anyway.

754
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:59,900
Richard: That's the age-old thing about laptops about they make you sterile and stuff like that?

755
00:48:00,141 --> 00:48:01,086
Richard: I don't believe they do.

756
00:48:01,207 --> 00:48:07,042
Richard: but the Mac book will fry your nuts right there and then I Mean the one.

757
00:48:07,303 --> 00:48:12,040
Alison: one thing about that area of the body is it's outside for a reason to cool it down.

758
00:48:12,301 --> 00:48:14,735
Alison: Yeah, last thing you want to do is heat it up.

759
00:48:15,077 --> 00:48:15,640
Alison: Yeah, really?

760
00:48:16,062 --> 00:48:21,068
Richard: Yeah, if Steve Jobs came to the door now and said I'll give you this Mac book But I'm gonna have to take a listen away.

761
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:21,952

00:48:31,161 --> 00:48:32,084
Richard: Yeah, my book Pro.

767
00:48:34,353 --> 00:48:36,260
Richard: I mean if it was just a Mac book, I'd want a big hard.

768
00:48:37,462 --> 00:48:39,231
Richard: This is I wouldn't really swap you.

769
00:48:39,272 --> 00:48:39,995
Richard: That's unfair.

770
00:48:40,015 --> 00:48:40,880
Richard: I'm only joking.

771
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,829
Richard: Geeks make the best boyfriends.

772
00:48:44,211 --> 00:48:45,498

00:50:06,621 --> 00:50:07,223

00:51:56,508 --> 00:52:05,399
Alison: Yeah, so you do y'all hook up over the internet And talk about what's come in and what could possibly be Steve saying in this time?

Alison: I can predict what he's gonna wear.

823
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,605
Richard: That's it's becoming a game now.

824
00:52:12,705 --> 00:52:13,808
Richard: It's like this big thing.

825
00:52:14,289 --> 00:52:15,993
Richard: I should do a website right here.

826
00:52:16,134 --> 00:52:17,096
Richard: is we we?

827
00:52:17,196 --> 00:52:25,920
Richard: we Wait, every time there's a big Apple event coming out people can post their like top three what I think is gonna happen.

828
00:52:26,081 --> 00:52:27,940
Richard: Yeah, and then the winner gets a prize.

829
00:52:29,185 --> 00:52:29,939
Richard: That's crap idea.

830
00:52:31,462 --> 00:52:32,264
Alison: Fund a prize.

831
00:52:32,284 --> 00:52:33,007
Alison: That's a rubbish.

832
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:37,762
Richard: Well, we get lots of hits and we make I don't know Forget it.

833
00:52:37,822 --> 00:52:39,227
Alison: Okay, we could make a prize.

834
00:52:39,287 --> 00:52:40,551
Alison: I suppose rubbish.

835
00:52:40,651 --> 00:52:43,380
Richard: But anyway, yeah, that's when my broken iPod.

836
00:52:45,481 --> 00:53:05,591
Alison: That's what you do though, I can remember I was racing back from your parents house To see the keynote live because you didn't want to wait for it and then we got back and because every Geek in the world was sat streaming the same piece of video We got about three seconds at a time before it cut again,

837
00:53:05,631 --> 00:53:08,700
Richard: but I sat there for four hours watching those three seconds of the time

838
00:53:10,642 --> 00:53:13,514
Alison: By the time we'd seen it it had been reported.

839
00:53:13,574 --> 00:53:14,538
Alison: we could have just read it.

840
00:53:14,679 --> 00:53:17,697
Richard: Yeah Well, it's reported quicker than you get the video.

841
00:53:17,758 --> 00:53:21,180
Richard: now You can read a live blog faster than they put the video.

842
00:53:21,601 --> 00:53:26,520
Richard: The thing that frustrates me is that when a new thing comes out you want to hear it on the video?

843
00:53:27,006 --> 00:53:28,039
Richard: You want to see Steve go?

844
00:53:28,361 --> 00:53:29,659
Richard: Oh, and there is one more thing.

845
00:53:30,202 --> 00:53:36,423
Richard: But by the time the videos out you've got to go to the website to get it and they've put the new thing on the front Page of the website.

846
00:53:36,604 --> 00:53:42,999
Richard: Yeah, so you've got to sort of not look at the screen and try and hit the button To go to the video page.

847
00:53:49,283 --> 00:54:02,500
Richard: If you were going to a website to watch a TV episode and on the front page of the Website was the last scene of the film Watch the first episode of 24. in the last episode Jack died.

848
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:04,247
Richard: It would be pointless.

849
00:54:04,327 --> 00:54:05,733
Richard: It's like I'm not gonna mother.

850
00:54:06,235 --> 00:54:07,059
Richard: so that's what it is.

851
00:54:07,621 --> 00:54:11,859
Richard: But we still watch and I've watched many of them several times and even old ones.

852
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,685
Richard: I know and I don't know why.

853
00:54:13,705 --> 00:54:16,854
Alison: you like his style as well as much as you hear.

854
00:54:17,155 --> 00:54:19,603
Alison: you enjoy hearing him talk about his Thing.

855
00:54:19,743 --> 00:54:20,666
Alison: you enjoy style.

856
00:54:20,766 --> 00:54:22,813
Richard: you like his present love him or hate him.

857
00:54:23,315 --> 00:54:25,020
Richard: The man is a fantastic presenter.

858
00:54:25,182 --> 00:54:26,620
Richard: He does well on stage.

859
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:32,058
Richard: Yeah More rumors surrounding the clicky thing.

860
00:54:32,845 --> 00:54:34,680
Richard: Apparently it's not an actual clicky thing.

861
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:45,494
Richard: Apparently it goes to a room behind the stage that switches a light on that says you switch that thing over now or That's just upsetting because I really wanted the clicky thing to be a real thing.

862
00:54:45,555 --> 00:54:46,357
Richard: Yeah, it's not.

863
00:54:46,398 --> 00:54:46,960
Alison: I don't know why.

864
00:54:48,621 --> 00:54:55,488
Richard: I think you see some people say there was one he did where it broke Yeah, and he had to make a joke about Apple.

865
00:54:55,528 --> 00:54:56,491
Richard: doesn't make the clicker thing.

866
00:54:56,792 --> 00:54:57,213
Richard: Whatever.

867
00:54:57,614 --> 00:54:58,757
Richard: Yeah, but I don't know.

868
00:54:59,499 --> 00:55:00,947
Alison: so Let's go back.

869
00:55:00,967 --> 00:55:03,260
Richard: You know, we've talked about this for half an hour now.

870
00:55:03,381 --> 00:55:06,719
Richard: We haven't really discovered anything new other than I hate myself.

871
00:55:07,941 --> 00:55:09,787
Alison: I'll tell you one thing that did elevate you though.

872
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:13,017
Alison: You didn't go whole hog with the old Apple thing.

873
00:55:13,037 --> 00:55:15,518
Alison: You didn't get that crappy phone.

874
00:55:16,481 --> 00:55:18,126
Richard: That oh the iTunes phone.

875
00:55:18,508 --> 00:55:19,611
Richard: no, I would I didn't get that.

876
00:55:19,772 --> 00:55:20,394
Alison: you didn't get that.

877
00:55:20,414 --> 00:55:22,300
Alison: so, you know completely suckered.

878
00:55:23,201 --> 00:55:26,758
Richard: Well, I'm sat here surrounded by a power Mac and an eyesight and an iPod in there.

879
00:55:27,805 --> 00:55:28,793
Richard: Actually, you know, that's it.

880
00:55:29,277 --> 00:55:34,212
Alison: Yeah The computer that's behind me wishing it was an iMac.

881
00:55:34,432 --> 00:55:35,796
Richard: Oh you wish it was an iMac.

882
00:55:35,856 --> 00:55:37,220
Alison: No you wish it was an iMac.

883
00:55:37,621 --> 00:55:41,660
Alison: Yeah, you want me to get an iMac more than I want to get an iMac.

884
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:44,040
Richard: It's easier if everybody's using the same.

885
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:47,612
Alison: Completely agree with you, but I am pointing out a fact here.

886
00:55:47,712 --> 00:55:49,520
Alison: You want it for me more than I want.

887
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,909
Richard: You see this is something people don't understand especially in America.

888
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:57,099
Richard: Is that I chat is an incredible instant messenger program.

889
00:55:57,179 --> 00:56:03,720
Richard: it Some I'm sure that everybody has a different opinion to me and everyone in the world who hears this is just gonna know I chat.

890
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:04,428
Richard: It's appalling.

891
00:56:04,589 --> 00:56:08,047
Alison: Oh, yeah But you like it.

892
00:56:08,148 --> 00:56:12,060
Richard: it's my favorite one, but the trouble is I can only speak to Tristan or my dad.

893
00:56:12,941 --> 00:56:14,470
Alison: Right, if I got it we could.

894
00:56:14,651 --> 00:56:18,519
Richard: and if we're in the same room Well, not just for you, but when I'm away and stuff.

895
00:56:18,821 --> 00:56:20,067
Alison: So you can speak to Tristan my dad.

896
00:56:20,087 --> 00:56:30,649
Richard: and So the plan is if I get everyone that I know on to a Mac then we can all use I chat and I don't Have to have stupid MSM messenger.

897
00:56:30,669 --> 00:56:32,780
Alison: That's so much cheaper than MSM message.

898
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:37,694
Richard: We are like the only country in the world where MSM messenger is a big thing.

899
00:56:38,496 --> 00:56:39,880
Richard: no one uses it in America.

900
00:56:40,883 --> 00:56:47,612
Richard: Yeah, they all they're all on aim on AOL and stuff which is why I chat works in America because everyone's on AOL.

901
00:56:47,952 --> 00:56:50,740
Richard: Okay, but here MSM and it sucks ass.

902
00:56:52,602 --> 00:56:54,229
Alison: Yeah, you can't use it on MSN.

903
00:56:54,249 --> 00:56:54,590
Alison: Can you?

904
00:56:54,751 --> 00:56:57,040
Richard: I can use MSM but it's like the most basic.

905
00:57:00,201 --> 00:57:02,488
Richard: So we have to do Skype for video to video thing.

906
00:57:02,508 --> 00:57:04,354
Richard: Yeah, we're not even seen that working.

907
00:57:04,374 --> 00:57:04,915
Richard: Yeah, actually.

908
00:57:05,517 --> 00:57:07,829
Richard: No, no Should we wrap up?

909
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,299
Richard: Yeah, let's wrap up.

910
00:57:09,921 --> 00:57:13,009
Alison: I mean we were gonna talk a little bit about.

911
00:57:13,109 --> 00:57:26,400
Alison: you know, the geeks do make good boyfriends and despite all your Apple love and well Apple frenzy You are a very good boyfriend for all the reasons that are on Craigslist.

912
00:57:28,126 --> 00:57:28,633
Richard: should we give a?

913
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:35,739
Richard: Basically, there's a. there's a list on Craigslist, isn't there of why geeks make of why geeks and nerds are worth it?

914
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,926
Richard: That's a very long URL to give out.

915
00:57:39,126 --> 00:57:46,327
Richard: it is but if you do it, I'm sure if you google why geeks and nerds are worth it Then you'll probably get it.

916
00:57:46,488 --> 00:57:47,774
Alison: There's plenty of reasons here.

917
00:57:47,794 --> 00:57:48,699
Alison: I mean some of them.

918
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,638
Alison: Really you all over.

919
00:57:52,701 --> 00:57:59,912
Alison: Just give me a couple And My romantics and you give them credit for really I'm yeah you are.

920
00:57:59,932 --> 00:58:00,293
Alison: Okay.

921
00:58:00,333 --> 00:58:08,580
Alison: Yeah, and it says here Okay, true their idea of romance might be to make up a spiffy web page with all the reasons why they love you.

922
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:09,744
Alison: You haven't done that.

923
00:58:10,126 --> 00:58:10,848
Richard: I'm not gonna do that.

924
00:58:10,868 --> 00:58:12,173
Alison: You've built pages and I'm on them.

925
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:13,800
Richard: Oh, that's a different thing.

926
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:14,442
