1
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,619
Rym: It's Thursday November 30th.

2
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:14,550
Rym: I'm Rym and I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:15,637
Rym: Tonight.

4
00:00:15,698 --> 00:00:21,490
Rym: we take a look back at the previous 221 episodes we've done for a little bit of meta discussion.

5
00:00:23,032 --> 00:00:23,784
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,312 --> 00:00:33,406
Rym: You know, it was kind of weird today riding my bike at night Being the fact that it's the end of November December starts.

7
00:00:33,487 --> 00:00:34,129
Rym: what tomorrow?

8
00:00:35,051 --> 00:00:36,819
Scott: Yeah, tomorrow's December 1.

9
00:00:36,819 --> 00:00:41,477
Rym: Yeah, so I'm riding my bike at night In shorts and a tank top.

10
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:48,810
Rym: I ride past a house that not only has Christmas lights up But the Christmas lights are illuminating the bright green lawn.

11
00:00:49,912 --> 00:00:51,449
Rym: Yeah, and we live in New York.

12
00:00:52,212 --> 00:00:55,703
Scott: I think the weirdest part about it is the night part because you know, it's.

13
00:00:56,224 --> 00:01:02,386
Scott: it's so weird now on the way home I got to use the headlights and it's like dark but you realize that happens every year.

14
00:01:02,447 --> 00:01:06,102
Scott: That's not weird at all I know but that's my I feel every year.

15
00:01:06,183 --> 00:01:07,690
Scott: It's like whoa drastic change.

16
00:01:08,091 --> 00:01:15,774
Rym: Okay, so you're saying it's weird that something that's happened every year since the dawn of earth Happened again this year.

17
00:01:15,794 --> 00:01:22,970
Rym: and yet I'm saying it's weird that it's basically December and I'm riding my bike at night in shorts and a t-shirt.

18
00:01:23,912 --> 00:01:24,374
Scott: Yeah, you know what?

19
00:01:24,394 --> 00:01:25,096
Scott: It means though.

20
00:01:25,116 --> 00:01:29,930
Scott: It means that we're gonna have snow and March and possibly April doesn't mean that at all.

21
00:01:30,171 --> 00:01:31,356
Rym: We don't know what it means.

22
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,605
Scott: No, but that's probably what it means.

23
00:01:33,826 --> 00:01:34,870
Rym: I'll bet it means the opposite.

24
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:40,349
Rym: I'll bet not only did when the fall basically not happen and it just stayed summer until now.

25
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:44,048
Rym: But it's probably going to be a short winter and it's gonna be.

26
00:01:45,373 --> 00:01:48,110
Scott: Until now there were a couple weeks of coldness coldness.

27
00:01:48,211 --> 00:01:54,361
Scott: It never dropped below like 50 during the day at all Even once there was a week or two where I had to wear a coat.

28
00:01:54,863 --> 00:01:56,610
Rym: what when I didn't wear a coat?

29
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:58,798
Scott: Well, this is you didn't doesn't mean everyone else wasn't.

30
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,967
Rym: Yeah, I mean Pete don't need to wear coats.

31
00:02:01,248 --> 00:02:04,924
Scott: Yeah Pete's been complaining about the cold lately because he lost weight.

32
00:02:05,004 --> 00:02:05,386
Rym: Yeah.

33
00:02:05,406 --> 00:02:06,290
Scott: All right.

34
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,224
Rym: So so yeah, apparently it frightens you that it gets dark out in the winter.

35
00:02:12,244 --> 00:02:14,070
Scott: Yeah dark is scary.

36
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,158
Scott: Warm is not scary.

37
00:02:16,198 --> 00:02:18,230
Scott: dark is even though I like dark better.

38
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:21,870
Rym: But I can think of warm things that are scary and dark things that aren't scary.

39
00:02:22,553 --> 00:02:24,661
Scott: I can think of the opposite so that doesn't mean shit.

40
00:02:24,842 --> 00:02:26,750
Rym: Anyway, it means your correlation is false.

41
00:02:27,011 --> 00:02:28,878
Scott: You know, it's scary the we froze today.

42
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:31,710
Rym: Yeah, actually that happened a little while ago.

43
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:33,755
Rym: Scott was playing bowling or something.

44
00:02:33,775 --> 00:02:39,350
Rym: I was making a D&D character and suddenly it freezes the we just freezes and starts making this noise.

45
00:02:40,055 --> 00:02:41,870
Scott: No, it wasn't actually making a noise.

46
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:48,696
Scott: What had happened was it was in the process of making a noise like out of the speakers of the TV and it froze And just held the tone.

47
00:02:48,716 --> 00:02:51,570
Rym: Uh, it sounded like that noise was coming from the unit.

48
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,862
Scott: It wasn't when I went up to the unit I listened in.

49
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,329
Scott: it was coming out of the speakers of the TV.

50
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,218
Scott: You're sure I'm a hundred percent sure.

51
00:02:57,299 --> 00:02:59,087
Rym: Okay still the point is your.

52
00:02:59,107 --> 00:03:04,170
Scott: we froze It froze up and I had to turn unplug it plug it back in and then it was all good.

53
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:05,535
Rym: What are you gonna do about that?

54
00:03:05,576 --> 00:03:06,580
Rym: What if it freezes again?

55
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,789
Scott: if it keeps freezing too many times?

56
00:03:08,809 --> 00:03:14,070
Scott: so far It's frozen once and I don't remember but I might have like banged my foot on the floor.

57
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:15,285
Scott: That could have been the cause, you know.

58
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:28,218
Scott: Considering the nature of a lot of the games that are played on the Wii I know but if it continues to freeze more times, I'll just get a new one for Nintendo Alright, so what's the over-under here?

59
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:37,954
Scott: if we were to make a wager under as to whether or not it'll freeze again If it freezes when I'm fighting a boss in Zelda and I have to redo a lot of stuff and I get pissed off Then I'll get a new.

60
00:03:38,154 --> 00:03:39,900
Rym: I'll bet that within 14 days.

61
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:40,964
Rym: It freezes again.

62
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:45,715
Rym: I just that's my hunch.

63
00:03:46,076 --> 00:03:48,685
Rym: I will go up to 14 days at a considerable sum.

64
00:03:48,705 --> 00:03:50,010
Scott: No, we'll find out.

65
00:03:50,493 --> 00:03:51,561
Rym: Well, you don't want to take the wager.

66
00:03:51,883 --> 00:03:52,709
Scott: No, not really not.

67
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,030
Rym: Because don't you trust Nintendo?

68
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:58,023
Rym: Yeah, so you don't trust Nintendo.

69
00:03:58,103 --> 00:04:02,077
Scott: I don't bet if it's not a sure thing But that's stupid.

70
00:04:02,097 --> 00:04:03,422
Scott: It's smart.

71
00:04:03,482 --> 00:04:04,144
Scott: I always win.

72
00:04:04,425 --> 00:04:06,090
Rym: No, cuz you're always betting on things.

73
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,090
Rym: You're betting that you won't crash when you drive to work.

74
00:04:08,871 --> 00:04:09,293
Scott: You're bad.

75
00:04:09,354 --> 00:04:09,816
Scott: I don't.

76
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:11,646
Rym: but you're betting it's not a sure thing.

77
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:12,410
Scott: It's a sure thing.

78
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,012
Scott: I won't crash.

79
00:04:13,093 --> 00:04:17,550
Rym: No steamroller could just pop out or a car could steamroller just pop out.

80
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,416
Scott: They're so slow.

81
00:04:18,437 --> 00:04:23,138
Rym: a car could just ram you And we could be stopped at a traffic light.

82
00:04:23,178 --> 00:04:25,407
Scott: if a guy rams me he wins.

83
00:04:25,427 --> 00:04:26,950
Rym: oh, yeah I'm not saying he doesn't win.

84
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,219
Rym: I'm saying you're betting that that won't happen cuz you could.

85
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:31,387
Rym: the only sure bet is to not go out the door.

86
00:04:31,507 --> 00:04:32,613
Scott: a sure enough Bet.

87
00:04:33,056 --> 00:04:34,909
Rym: well, so what's the threshold of so sure enough?

88
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:36,913
Rym: What's the line?

89
00:04:37,134 --> 00:04:38,518
Rym: What makes something a sure bet?

90
00:04:38,558 --> 00:04:41,870
Rym: Cuz nothing sure where I'm sure you're sure.

91
00:04:42,051 --> 00:04:45,401
Rym: So your threshold of sureness is not a hundred percent proof sureness.

92
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:46,866
Scott: No, okay.

93
00:04:47,146 --> 00:04:48,230
Rym: That's all I wanted you to say.

94
00:04:49,751 --> 00:04:51,759
Rym: Anyway, I'm actually on my way to work.

95
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,494
Rym: I passed a fatal accident again Two days in a row.

96
00:04:56,514 --> 00:05:06,987
Rym: I have passed a fatal a fatal accident today, and I'm not sure if it was a fatal accident Yesterday and they were both at approximately the same spot on my way to the commute.

97
00:05:07,047 --> 00:05:07,930
Scott: watch out for that spot.

98
00:05:08,456 --> 00:05:13,809
Rym: It's a straight road And both of them were single car accidents.

99
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:17,220
Rym: The thing is what was sad is I was.

100
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:23,895
Rym: you know the driver appeared to be fine And I'm pretty sure was the passenger who got killed And it looked like they died.

101
00:05:24,056 --> 00:05:38,281
Rym: they weren't wearing their seatbelt because the oh well the windshield where the passenger was was shattered with a more shattered a head-shaped spot and A red spot in the middle of that where you got damn seatbelt.

102
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:43,783
Rym: if you don't and you deserve what you get yeah It's just the fact that there were two acts.

103
00:05:43,823 --> 00:05:44,710
Rym: not only that there were two.

104
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:56,950
Rym: You know these two accidents at the same spot on my way to work on my way home today There was an accident at the same spot on the northbound side And again, it was a single car accident.

105
00:05:57,615 --> 00:06:04,910
Scott: I didn't see any accidents today But I saw a lot of activity of ambulances and police cars driving really fast and going somewhere.

106
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:09,366
Scott: So that's usually either an accident or a fire or something like that.

107
00:06:09,487 --> 00:06:10,430
Rym: see I knew it was a bad sign.

108
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:19,809
Rym: I was driving to work and a police car came up behind me, and I was going like 80 85 But I wasn't like I was feeding it relative to the rest of the traffic.

109
00:06:20,551 --> 00:06:22,963
Rym: Everyone was going that fast and the cop didn't pull anyway.

110
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:29,398
Rym: He just kind of pulls up behind us we all get out of his way, and he speeds off at like a hundred and Then you know I keep driving.

111
00:06:29,418 --> 00:06:35,610
Scott: then another cop car passes me And I started easy - that means there's an accident pretty much all the time.

112
00:06:36,695 --> 00:06:42,463
Rym: And sure enough five minutes later I get to this accident and the road was totally blocked a couple days ago.

113
00:06:42,523 --> 00:06:46,035
Scott: There was an accident in Connecticut on Exit 23.

114
00:06:46,035 --> 00:06:50,710
Rym: I get all I saw signs warning me about that on the way to the taconic.

115
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,354
Scott: Yeah, what I was?

116
00:06:52,615 --> 00:06:54,299
Scott: I get off exit 20 end.

117
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,746
Scott: ah which is three exits before.

118
00:06:56,806 --> 00:06:58,410
Rym: that was it blocked past your exit?

119
00:06:58,681 --> 00:07:09,118
Scott: No But when I was at exit 18 There was like this huge slow down for like half a mile that I pretty sure was a wave of Slowness caused by the accident.

120
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,468
Rym: we should talk about traffic waves sometime.

121
00:07:11,608 --> 00:07:14,416
Scott: sometime We should because actually it's funny.

122
00:07:14,576 --> 00:07:26,350
Rym: every I've I've witnessed five or six accidents during my commute and almost all of them Were caused during a traffic wave and in more than half of them the person who caused the accident had out-of-state plates.

123
00:07:26,771 --> 00:07:37,229
Rym: I think that people who aren't used to traffic waves don't expect them Because I don't think they happen in a lot of places in this country to the degree that they happen in downstate, New York.

124
00:07:38,034 --> 00:07:51,142
Rym: I mean literally you'll be driving Around here and traffic will be going 75 85 and then suddenly this wave will pass through and all the cars will be going 10 And then 30 seconds later traffic suddenly go in 75 again.

125
00:07:51,162 --> 00:07:56,390
Rym: Yeah, no reason no accident nothing There's no warning it just comes out of nowhere.

126
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:01,429
Scott: I mean there are ways to bust up a traffic wave, but you have to know it's coming and prepare for it.

127
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,239
Rym: Yeah, actually the best way to prevent traffic.

128
00:08:04,299 --> 00:08:06,045
Rym: Well, no, we'll do a show on it instead.

129
00:08:06,105 --> 00:08:11,700
Scott: lots of do lots of Don't leave lots of space between you and the car in front of you.

130
00:08:12,061 --> 00:08:14,550
Scott: Well, they're gonna eat it up at the right, right?

131
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,639
Rym: Yep, yep And yeah, of course the thing is you can't.

132
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,925
Rym: you do much to traffic waves in front of you But you can prevent them for people behind you by gunning it.

133
00:08:22,106 --> 00:08:28,184
Rym: Yeah Yeah, yeah, it's just scary how many accidents I see on the way to work.

134
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,330
Scott: All right, you got a news.

135
00:08:29,711 --> 00:08:34,409
Rym: I do have a news and I talked more about it, but I want to turn it into a regular show.

136
00:08:34,571 --> 00:08:38,489
Rym: But I don't want to do it as the show tonight because it's something that I think.

137
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:40,350
Scott: so We'll try to limit our talk about this news.

138
00:08:40,551 --> 00:08:49,067
Rym: I'm just gonna bring up the issue and I don't think I need to say What my feelings might be or what the problem here is, you know, let's try it.

139
00:08:49,348 --> 00:08:49,890
Rym: an exercise.

140
00:08:50,392 --> 00:08:55,749
Rym: I'm going to say certain facts and you can infer whatever opinions you want about these.

141
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:10,190
Rym: one according to recent data Seven million people as in one in every 32 American adults is behind bars on probation or on parole.

142
00:09:11,111 --> 00:09:21,987
Rym: alrighty one in 32 if you count our extended friend group then Statistically several of our friends should be in jail or at least on parole or probation.

143
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:29,910
Rym: Yeah probation Yeah, not that much difference As far as I'm concerned to me because it doesn't affect me because I'll never be on any of those things.

144
00:09:30,232 --> 00:09:31,019
Scott: No, probably not.

145
00:09:31,099 --> 00:09:36,389
Rym: if either of us gets arrested It'll probably be by some secret police and we'll be shot in a back alley against the wall.

146
00:09:36,871 --> 00:09:38,858
Scott: Probations really not so bad.

147
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,564
Rym: What do you know?

148
00:09:40,604 --> 00:09:41,889
Rym: Well, how does probation work Scott?

149
00:09:42,953 --> 00:09:44,350
Rym: What exactly does it entail?

150
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:47,040
Rym: How specifically is it different from parole?

151
00:09:47,261 --> 00:09:49,549
Rym: what bodies adjudicated and administer it?

152
00:09:50,491 --> 00:09:52,057
Scott: It's sort of like academic probation.

153
00:09:52,097 --> 00:09:55,210
Scott: It's like you're doing bad, but not bad enough to go to jail yet.

154
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:59,569
Scott: So we're gonna keep an eye on you to make sure you don't do anything bad.

155
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:01,998
Rym: Yeah Well probation is like yeah, you fucked up.

156
00:10:02,058 --> 00:10:02,660
Rym: You're guilty.

157
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,730
Rym: We're gonna put you on probation if you do anything wrong.

158
00:10:05,891 --> 00:10:06,994
Rym: We're throwing books at you.

159
00:10:07,014 --> 00:10:10,445
Rym: Yeah, I'm sure someone will yell at us and say that technically whatever.

160
00:10:10,465 --> 00:10:13,398
Scott: It's a good general Saying specifically what it is.

161
00:10:13,418 --> 00:10:23,322
Rym: now, I don't know specifically what it is and Generally what it rolls when you were in jail and they let you out But if you screw up you're coming right back in or something to that effect.

162
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:29,463
Scott: Yep, but one in 32 Americans Think about American adults kid, you know, that doesn't count the yeah.

163
00:10:29,483 --> 00:10:31,090
Rym: Well, the thing is it's almost all males.

164
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:35,050
Rym: So it counts the whole population, but most people in prison are males.

165
00:10:35,512 --> 00:10:40,872
Rym: So if you just look at males, then the number is significantly scarier than one in 32.

166
00:10:40,872 --> 00:10:54,528
Rym: Well, in fact and there are some areas in America not a lot But there are areas where if you're African American and you're a man It is more likely that you have been in jail or on parole than that.

167
00:10:54,548 --> 00:10:56,093
Rym: You have not Yikes.

168
00:10:56,514 --> 00:10:57,717
Rym: Yeah, not.

169
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,382
Rym: that doesn't imply any racism.

170
00:10:59,422 --> 00:11:02,350
Rym: that implies just data a lot of bad things.

171
00:11:02,713 --> 00:11:03,749
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

172
00:11:04,091 --> 00:11:12,292
Rym: But another scary statistic is that prison populations are increasing despite the fact that prison releases are also Increasing.

173
00:11:12,332 --> 00:11:18,110
Scott: that means prison entries are increasing faster than prison releases are increasing.

174
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:21,420
Rym: Yes, I don't think you needed to say the other increasing on the end.

175
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,423
Rym: I think it was implied.

176
00:11:22,443 --> 00:11:22,965
Rym: Yeah.

177
00:11:23,246 --> 00:11:23,486
Rym: Yeah.

178
00:11:23,527 --> 00:11:24,590
Rym: Yeah a little tired.

179
00:11:24,832 --> 00:11:30,550
Rym: Yeah, both of us because it's Thursday We've had a we and I didn't play Zelda today.

180
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:34,451
Scott: I played boxing a hundred times to get pro level tomorrow playing Zelda See.

181
00:11:34,552 --> 00:11:44,781
Rym: instead of doing the show like I should have been doing I was making a D&D character I was riding my bike and I was writing or playing Really cheesy rock music on this keyboard.

182
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:47,330
Scott: Okay, so what else is in your news there?

183
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:56,339
Rym: Well according to this also of the increase in prisoners a full half are Nonviolent drug of their drug related offenses.

184
00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:57,383
Rym: Uh-huh.

185
00:11:57,945 --> 00:11:58,366
Scott: All righty.

186
00:11:58,908 --> 00:12:03,049
Rym: Yeah This isn't in the article, but it's related information.

187
00:12:04,111 --> 00:12:07,764
Rym: America has the highest prison population of any country in the world.

188
00:12:08,306 --> 00:12:10,175
Rym: not per capita But raw.

189
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:13,089
Rym: we have more prisoners than China or Russia.

190
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,634
Scott: Wow It's scary.

191
00:12:15,674 --> 00:12:19,807
Rym: not people on parole actual prisoners people in jail currently behind bars.

192
00:12:19,847 --> 00:12:20,389
Rym: Can't get out.

193
00:12:21,193 --> 00:12:23,310
Rym: Now if you look at per capita, it's a little bit better.

194
00:12:24,232 --> 00:12:26,002
Rym: percentage wise we're number two.

195
00:12:26,022 --> 00:12:29,069
Rym: Oh Number one is Rwanda.

196
00:12:30,588 --> 00:12:35,849
Scott: Oh Rwanda Yeah, where they put like half the people in jail?

197
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:41,390
Rym: As far as I Rwanda could just be a giant wall around the country.

198
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:48,827
Scott: yeah, so Rwanda is the only place worse than the US in terms of locking people up.

199
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,116
Rym: now I could go on and on about these statistics.

200
00:12:51,136 --> 00:13:02,538
Rym: just read this article and I suggest you read the Wikipedia's and various statistics about prison populations and what Offenses people who are in prison Have been convicted of and the rate.

201
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:17,642
Rym: it's kind of scary and it's amazing that despite the fact that America is viewed by many As a free country we incarcerate more people than any other country in the world and most of them are incarcerated because They hurt themselves and didn't hurt anyone else.

202
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:29,477
Rym: Yeah, well, I think it was Jimmy Carter Before Congress, he was talking about the drug war and he effectively said that the punishment for doing drugs should not cause more harm Than the drugs themselves cause.

203
00:13:29,497 --> 00:13:33,470
Rym: Oh burn wiser words have not been spoken about that.

204
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:38,710
Rym: I'm not gonna say that it's cool to take crystal meth and freak out all the time.

205
00:13:38,971 --> 00:13:39,615
Scott: No, that's so.

206
00:13:39,836 --> 00:13:42,050
Rym: or or take heroin until you die in an alley.

207
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:47,380
Rym: But if you punish someone for doing that worse than the drugs were gonna hurt him in the first place.

208
00:13:48,771 --> 00:13:55,390
Scott: Man, yeah, the thing is is like it's someone doing meth right out in the middle of nowhere.

209
00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:00,526
Scott: That kind of sucks, I don't really want them doing that but they can do whatever they want.

210
00:14:00,566 --> 00:14:01,910
Scott: They're hurting themselves pretty bad.

211
00:14:02,131 --> 00:14:04,238
Rym: Yeah, well meth heads tend to hurt other people too.

212
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:08,010
Rym: There's a problem there and making meth is a really dangerous bad thing.

213
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:08,431
Scott: That's true.

214
00:14:08,532 --> 00:14:08,893
Scott: That's true.

215
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:12,185
Scott: But you know for the most part they're hurting themselves.

216
00:14:12,245 --> 00:14:18,801
Scott: most damages on them And if we you know Put them in jail, that's even more harm on to them.

217
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:21,150
Rym: But now you think these people get help when they're in jail.

218
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:27,010
Scott: But the thing is what you're really doing when you put him in jail is doing more harm to me.

219
00:14:27,332 --> 00:14:28,586
Scott: I got to pay for that jail.

220
00:14:30,191 --> 00:14:35,690
Rym: The thing is I would rather pay for free drug support programs for people.

221
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,863
Rym: I say there should anyone who wants to get off drugs go to the government and get help.

222
00:14:39,225 --> 00:14:44,200
Rym: the thing is it has to be Science help though not narking on bullshit brandy help.

223
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:55,558
Scott: Yeah, the thing is most people in prison are either drug offenders violent crazy criminals insane people and drunk people Except in many cases.

224
00:14:55,598 --> 00:14:57,570
Rym: They rarely send drunk drivers to jail.

225
00:14:57,651 --> 00:14:59,990
Rym: They just find them a bunch of money and then they end up on the road again.

226
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:05,170
Scott: Anyway, I mean like not prison but jail like overnight jail is most of what police do.

227
00:15:06,494 --> 00:15:08,140
Scott: Drunk people, you know, you're drunk.

228
00:15:08,301 --> 00:15:09,064
Scott: You're going to jail.

229
00:15:09,084 --> 00:15:10,790
Rym: Well, I think it depends a lot on the area.

230
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:14,610
Scott: It does it does but it's like we could fix some of those problems.

231
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:19,650
Scott: The only people who really need to be in a jail or jail equivalent are the crazy violent people.

232
00:15:20,313 --> 00:15:23,570
Scott: We could take all the nuts and we can you have nut houses again instead of jail?

233
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:28,130
Rym: Yep, we need nut houses drug houses and I say for nonviolent crimes.

234
00:15:28,612 --> 00:15:35,349
Rym: I mean, I'm not you know, there are some libertarians out there say things like yeah We shouldn't put people in jail and we don't need police.

235
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,238
Rym: Yeah But I am perfectly okay with police.

236
00:15:38,258 --> 00:15:46,130
Scott: people who need to be in a prison are people who would be dangerous If they were walking on the street or I would argue repeat offenders.

237
00:15:46,692 --> 00:15:57,370
Rym: Hmm I mean even if you commit nonviolent crime, yeah, if you shoplift 40 times in a row, yeah Well, I mean, it's not necessarily a violent crime that hurts people, but it is a harmful crime.

238
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:00,950
Scott: They're hurting other true true and they are causing damage repeatedly.

239
00:16:01,071 --> 00:16:12,210
Scott: I mean if someone doesn't kill people but he goes around Smashing statues or something and he keeps doing it a lot He needs to go to jail so he can see he doesn't do it anymore.

240
00:16:12,531 --> 00:16:16,750
Rym: Yeah, or the nut house depending cuz it could be a crazy statue smash course.

241
00:16:16,831 --> 00:16:19,590
Rym: We follow that other recent scientific article to come out.

242
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,185
Rym: All we need to do is make it meet a bunch of fish and I'll calm down.

243
00:16:22,205 --> 00:16:24,777
Rym: Oh god I don't know if we actually talked about that.

244
00:16:24,998 --> 00:16:25,339
Scott: I don't know.

245
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:25,842
Scott: Whatever.

246
00:16:25,862 --> 00:16:27,348
Rym: I'll save that for the prison episode.

247
00:16:27,368 --> 00:16:36,733
Rym: So Yeah, but there's violent criminals from what I've read and all these statistics seem to make up the minority of people who are convicted Of crimes.

248
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:40,570
Rym: I don't know if that has to do with plea bargains or any other shenanigans.

249
00:16:41,153 --> 00:16:43,545
Rym: I didn't look at the raw data and I really don't have access to it.

250
00:16:43,846 --> 00:16:46,678
Rym: Yeah, but I Imagine if we only locked up.

251
00:16:46,718 --> 00:16:48,950
Rym: I mean, this isn't obviously a feasible solution.

252
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:53,790
Rym: But what if we only locked up violent criminals and we had other solutions for everything else?

253
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:58,141
Scott: I wonder what if we had another solution for anything besides just prison.

254
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:01,130
Rym: Yeah, except I don't know what with a violent criminal?

255
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,802
Rym: There's really nothing you can do other than put him in a nut house.

256
00:17:03,943 --> 00:17:06,990
Rym: if they're actually nuts put him Exile.

257
00:17:07,871 --> 00:17:08,834
Rym: Where are we gonna exile him?

258
00:17:08,854 --> 00:17:09,877
Rym: - no, I mean what.

259
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:12,484
Rym: we're gonna leave him in Rwanda drop him in the ocean.

260
00:17:13,207 --> 00:17:15,392
Rym: That's basically Execution.

261
00:17:15,432 --> 00:17:16,676
Rym: why bother with the exiling?

262
00:17:16,696 --> 00:17:19,929
Scott: just kill him at that point because technically it's not an execution.

263
00:17:19,989 --> 00:17:23,609
Rym: Yeah Yeah, you know that's what Oedipus his parents thought they're like, you know what?

264
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:28,590
Rym: We're gonna kill this kid, but we don't want to actually kill him in case the gods get pissy about it.

265
00:17:28,871 --> 00:17:30,961
Rym: So we'll just leave him out in the desert.

266
00:17:31,102 --> 00:17:33,994
Rym: and if he dies Well, that's great.

267
00:17:34,074 --> 00:17:39,575
Rym: And if he doesn't die if the gods want him to live then nothing will happen to him And then we won't get in trouble.

268
00:17:40,218 --> 00:17:42,910
Rym: That's the argument you just made and you know, what happened to Oedipus?

269
00:17:43,451 --> 00:17:44,595
Scott: No, no, but that's fine.

270
00:17:44,776 --> 00:17:46,180
Rym: You want to know what happened to Oedipus?

271
00:17:46,662 --> 00:17:47,143
Scott: He made it.

272
00:17:47,785 --> 00:17:49,230
Rym: He made it in a sense.

273
00:17:50,232 --> 00:17:56,740
Rym: If I made it you mean he grew up with a gimp foot had sex with his mom Killed his dad and ended up stabbing his eyes out.

274
00:17:57,182 --> 00:17:57,925
Scott: Yeah, it's good enough.

275
00:17:58,547 --> 00:18:00,914
Scott: All right, so Here's my news.

276
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:02,038
Rym: Oh, yeah, you got some news.

277
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:02,581
Scott: I do.

278
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:03,685
Scott: I do actually have news.

279
00:18:03,806 --> 00:18:04,850
Rym: All right lay it on me.

280
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:09,063
Scott: There's this thing called if you don't know about it the Antikythera mechanism.

281
00:18:09,765 --> 00:18:11,330
Rym: I can't pronounce Greek for shite.

282
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:21,924
Rym: So I hope you pronounced it right cuz I don't know a n t i k y t h e r a. and to get there I get my Greek pronunciation from the Byzantine Empire's guy who said straight up.

283
00:18:21,944 --> 00:18:23,248
Rym: You can't pronounce words in Greek.

284
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:26,910
Scott: Yes I think Greek might be one of the only things I can't pronounce.

285
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:32,333
Scott: Well anyway This is a very very old Mechanism.

286
00:18:32,493 --> 00:18:35,464
Scott: it's like from a hundred or a hundred and fifty BC.

287
00:18:35,484 --> 00:18:37,050
Scott: This is ancient shit, man.

288
00:18:37,251 --> 00:18:39,781
Rym: Yeah, it's basically depending on how you look at it.

289
00:18:39,861 --> 00:18:41,930
Rym: One of the earliest computers, right?

290
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,074
Scott: So we had this thing.

291
00:18:43,114 --> 00:18:47,993
Scott: we found it and we knew it was some sort of ancient computer Instrument.

292
00:18:48,153 --> 00:18:52,326
Scott: well mechanical computer instrument, you know, and yes, but we just couldn't figure it out.

293
00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:53,570
Scott: Like what exactly does it do?

294
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:54,955
Scott: How does it exactly work?

295
00:18:55,437 --> 00:18:57,766
Scott: I mean we took how old was it really?

296
00:18:57,786 --> 00:19:05,615
Rym: we took x-rays of it and we saw these gears and things in there and a lot of Randy nut jobs have pointed at it as evidence of all sorts of crazy shit.

297
00:19:06,219 --> 00:19:16,037
Rym: and I hate that because They have kind of overblown this thing and made it this mystical thing and use it as the basis for a lot of their bullshit Arguments, but all that aside.

298
00:19:16,097 --> 00:19:21,778
Rym: It's still a really amazing discovery and I think them Aggrandizing it that way kind of cheapens it.

299
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:26,876
Scott: Well, anyway some guys who are researching it Think if they they're pretty sure they figured it out.

300
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:30,909
Scott: their findings showed that the inscriptions it has inscriptions on it.

301
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,287
Scott: They related to lunar solar motions and the gears.

302
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:34,770
Scott: it's full.

303
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,053
Scott: It's basically a box full of gears.

304
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:45,589
Scott: We're a mechanical representation of the irregularities of the moon's orbital course across the sky as theorized by the astronomer Hipparcos.

305
00:19:46,771 --> 00:19:51,990
Scott: So basically this Hipparcos astronomer said, oh this is how the moon goes across the sky.

306
00:19:52,612 --> 00:19:54,960
Scott: This is how the Sun goes across the.

307
00:19:55,221 --> 00:19:57,328
Scott: you know sky and etc, etc, etc.

308
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:07,448
Scott: And they made this device where they would turn knobs on it and it could track those motions So it would remember, you know where the Sun is where the moon is where it's gonna be.

309
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:08,774
Rym: So think of this.

310
00:20:09,035 --> 00:20:24,810
Rym: the allerian Romans, you know the Greeks back in early Roman times basically made mechanical computers and then a thousand years later Europe was a stinking cesspool of medieval bullshit.

311
00:20:26,094 --> 00:20:28,895
Rym: Yeah, good game Barbarians.

312
00:20:29,276 --> 00:20:36,206
Scott: and this thing had 30 possibly 37 Hand-cut bronze gear wheels and they were.

313
00:20:36,246 --> 00:20:37,050
Scott: they had an in gene.

314
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:42,970
Scott: It's a in G. I'm reading from the article an ingenious pin and slot device connecting two gear wheels.

315
00:20:43,532 --> 00:20:44,235
Scott: Something something.

316
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:45,500
Rym: see that's big stuff.

317
00:20:45,561 --> 00:20:47,649
Scott: cuz I made cuz I think about this.

318
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:51,109
Scott: This is this machine that existed in a hundred and fifty BC.

319
00:20:51,812 --> 00:21:02,367
Scott: It was this technology was lost and they had to reinvent the gear hundreds and hundreds of years later Here let alone all the mathematics that went into this.

320
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:07,830
Scott: Yeah Well Hipparcos wasn't the most exact astronomer, but it was pretty good for the time.

321
00:21:07,931 --> 00:21:13,442
Scott: You know, it's like ah I got this wicked cool mechanical computer that follows the.

322
00:21:13,502 --> 00:21:15,869
Scott: who is the guy who thought the Sun was at the middle the?

323
00:21:16,069 --> 00:21:18,824
Rym: a lot Of people thought that I know the guy who Copernicus.

324
00:21:18,905 --> 00:21:25,896
Scott: Yeah The Copernicus model and it's like oh no Well, you got a computer.

325
00:21:25,956 --> 00:21:27,825
Scott: that does it right for that wrong model.

326
00:21:27,845 --> 00:21:32,620
Rym: Oh well The wrong model of the Sun is in the center of the.

327
00:21:33,562 --> 00:21:34,947
Scott: I meant the earth isn't okay.

328
00:21:34,967 --> 00:21:35,909
Scott: Center who is okay?

329
00:21:37,491 --> 00:21:41,970
Scott: Everyone before that right, but the guy what's the guy with the us at the end of the day?

330
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,661
Rym: Copernicus?

331
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:46,490
Rym: no, what other guy?

332
00:21:47,411 --> 00:21:48,394
Scott: Damn, what's the name of it?

333
00:21:48,554 --> 00:21:50,058
Rym: What guy are you talking about?

334
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:56,230
Rym: I mean, obviously you're talking about an earth centric universe view, but Whatever.

335
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,571
Scott: I don't remember the name.

336
00:21:57,591 --> 00:22:06,298
Scott: I don't know not everyone's seen that movie.

337
00:22:06,718 --> 00:22:08,400
Rym: Everyone should have it's it should have.

338
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:22,798
Rym: yes I mean, it's in that genre of movie that we like so wonderfully amazingly much, you know all those movies like Reservoir Dogs and Snatch Lockstock.

339
00:22:22,819 --> 00:22:24,948
Scott: Oh Pretty much all made by dog Saints.

340
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:28,120
Scott: all those movies are made by maybe yeah guys.

341
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,187
Scott: Well boondock Saints is made by one other guy.

342
00:22:30,227 --> 00:22:31,772
Scott: But yeah suicide Kings.

343
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:34,240
Scott: All right, that was made by a fourth guy.

344
00:22:34,461 --> 00:22:36,269
Rym: Oh way to shoot the theory down.

345
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,339
Scott: Yeah, but the king is the only one.

346
00:22:39,081 --> 00:22:43,719
Rym: Yeah, but we really like movies that are dark humor about guys with guns.

347
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:48,014
Scott: I mean the guy who made Snatch and Lockstock was Guy Ritchie.

348
00:22:48,235 --> 00:22:49,600
Rym: He's pretty much a one-trick pony.

349
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,784
Rym: He makes that kind of movie.

350
00:22:50,825 --> 00:22:51,507
Scott: He makes it real.

351
00:22:51,547 --> 00:22:53,294
Scott: Well, but he is Madonna's husband.

352
00:22:53,334 --> 00:22:54,458
Scott: I think now what?

353
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:57,459
Scott: yeah I think he's been Madonna's husband for a long time.

354
00:22:57,901 --> 00:23:01,533
Rym: I read FARC, but I pretty much skip over anything that has to do with celebrities.

355
00:23:01,753 --> 00:23:05,685
Scott: Yeah, unless it's Jack Thompson Jack times is not celebrity.

356
00:23:06,066 --> 00:23:07,130
Rym: Yeah, but I can't talk about him.

357
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,716
Rym: He didn't do anything particularly good.

358
00:23:08,776 --> 00:23:09,840
Scott: I made Pulp Fiction again.

359
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:13,799
Rym: I don't remember Quentin Tarantino that guy.

360
00:23:15,501 --> 00:23:16,265
Scott: I knew the name.

361
00:23:16,325 --> 00:23:17,611
Scott: I just I couldn't get it to come to me.

362
00:23:17,692 --> 00:23:28,439
Rym: Anyway, Pulp Fiction is You know a long movie and it's a good movie, but you know how there's been this trend of people Remixing a movie or remixing a movie trailer or phantom edits and all these things.

363
00:23:28,961 --> 00:23:34,400
Rym: So this guy took Pulp Fiction and he cut it down to a kind of abridged version.

364
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:36,760
Rym: It has everything important in Pulp Fiction.

365
00:23:37,242 --> 00:23:42,400
Rym: If you watch this you will get everything you would you would normally get out of Pulp Fiction.

366
00:23:43,244 --> 00:23:46,020
Rym: For you see this is a cut of Pulp Fiction.

367
00:23:46,462 --> 00:23:57,200
Rym: It's a video where they've cut out any time That a character is not saying the word fuck or a short phrase involving the word fuck like motherfucker.

368
00:23:57,601 --> 00:24:05,332
Rym: Yeah, you it includes probably my favorite line in the entire movie you motherfucker when the In case you haven't seen the movie.

369
00:24:05,352 --> 00:24:10,480
Rym: I can't ruin it, but Yeah, it's good stuff.

370
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:26,167
Rym: I mean the movie is really good But watching this you get one a sense of just how many times they say the word fuck in this movie to the point that The movie makes perfect sense if you cut out every word, but fuck Yeah, if you watch this

371
00:24:26,288 --> 00:24:26,830
Scott: you'll get it you'll.

372
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:28,960
Scott: it's everything it's everything.

373
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:36,520
Scott: This reminds me that I found a long time ago like some cuts of rap songs where they only left in the word fuck.

374
00:24:36,801 --> 00:24:43,319
Scott: I remember it was like fuck the police, but it was just like but but but but but but it was good stuff.

375
00:24:45,263 --> 00:24:47,760
Rym: Yeah, actually it was Yuko who told me about this.

376
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:53,871
Rym: It's old and I believe I might have seen it or heard of it at least a long time ago And I totally forgotten about it.

377
00:24:53,932 --> 00:24:58,413
Scott: I was reminded of it again and Well, it's definitely never been used as a thing of the day.

378
00:24:58,634 --> 00:24:59,579
Rym: Yeah, that's my test.

379
00:24:59,961 --> 00:25:05,380
Rym: Well a couple of our listeners complained once that a thing of the day we used was old hat.

380
00:25:05,521 --> 00:25:08,480
Rym: They'd seen it before and that's not really the point of GeekNights.

381
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:13,100
Rym: We're not the bleeding edge news because you can just read Fark if you want the bleeding edge news.

382
00:25:13,684 --> 00:25:15,619
Rym: We just pick things we want to talk about.

383
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:16,443
Scott: Yep.

384
00:25:16,845 --> 00:25:17,106
Scott: All right.

385
00:25:17,146 --> 00:25:17,990
Scott: So check this out.

386
00:25:18,372 --> 00:25:18,895
Rym: I'm checking.

387
00:25:19,156 --> 00:25:21,524
Scott: one of my favorite Classical music.

388
00:25:21,965 --> 00:25:32,387
Scott: well guys is the Tchaikovsky dude, right and he did the Nutcracker and he did the Swan Lake which both rocked the house and Some other guy apparently likes Tchaikovsky.

389
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:41,520
Scott: Also, he decided he was gonna make play the Nutcracker suite and record it and Put it on the internet, but he didn't have any instruments didn't have an orchestra.

390
00:25:42,483 --> 00:25:42,744
Scott: I don't know.

391
00:25:42,764 --> 00:25:45,293
Scott: He must have had a computer, but I guess he didn't want to use that.

392
00:25:45,775 --> 00:25:48,159
Scott: So he decided to use a bicycle.

393
00:25:49,124 --> 00:25:53,609
Rym: Now you might think okay How the hell can you play that on a bicycle?

394
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:59,637
Rym: now my way the way I would do it is I would take a bicycle Right and I'd mount an iPod mount to it.

395
00:26:03,341 --> 00:26:09,478
Scott: Now this guy used the spokes of the bicycle as the glockenspiel and clarinet melody.

396
00:26:09,498 --> 00:26:16,559
Scott: he Had derailleur cables like, you know pole to different lengths and he plucked them.

397
00:26:17,525 --> 00:26:19,239
Scott: You know cellos and the violins.

398
00:26:19,641 --> 00:26:24,737
Rym: You could just say derailleur because the word derailleur in English means that in French.

399
00:26:24,777 --> 00:26:25,520
Rym: It doesn't matter.

400
00:26:25,741 --> 00:26:29,054
Scott: Well, the derailleur is is like the device.

401
00:26:29,094 --> 00:26:30,680
Scott: It's the actual cables that he's plucking.

402
00:26:31,262 --> 00:26:32,828
Scott: Yeah, the derailleur is like is the?

403
00:26:32,848 --> 00:26:36,805
Rym: yeah, but the derailleur cables can be called derailleur cables Don't need to say in French.

404
00:26:36,945 --> 00:26:38,291
Scott: Anyway for the triangle.

405
00:26:38,332 --> 00:26:42,385
Scott: He hit the disc brake with something and Everything else the percussion.

406
00:26:42,425 --> 00:26:43,788
Scott: he would shift the gears.

407
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:50,952
Scott: he would you know pull the brake he would pull on the chain He would spin the wheels around all kinds of stuff.

408
00:26:50,992 --> 00:26:53,100
Rym: Scott played this for me and it's pretty badass.

409
00:26:53,481 --> 00:26:58,597
Scott: Yeah, if no one told you that it was being played on a bicycle you you would might not know.

410
00:26:58,718 --> 00:27:01,627
Scott: cuz it's so Exact it sounds great.

411
00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:04,059
Scott: Yeah, it's short though, but whatever.

412
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:09,239
Rym: So today as usual for the course of Thursday, we weren't really sure what to do.

413
00:27:09,722 --> 00:27:16,976
Rym: We debated for a while kind of lazily Where we had some really gems of ideas as to what to do the show on.

414
00:27:16,997 --> 00:27:19,913
Scott: I Came up with an idea that we already did.

415
00:27:20,115 --> 00:27:23,728
Rym: Yeah Which I'd make fun of him except I've done that before too.

416
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:29,799
Rym: Yeah, I'll sit there be like, let's do a show on Big O Let's do a show about waiting in line.

417
00:27:32,903 --> 00:27:39,662
Scott: And the other thing is like he coming up with the Monday Tuesday Wednesday ideas and not so much Thursday Yeah, and I come up with Thursdays but we always.

418
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:46,619
Rym: they're always something where we want to do research and put forth a case instead of just bullshitting about it and We just don't do the research.

419
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:53,074
Scott: Yeah, like we could have just bullshitted about that whole prison thing for the whole episode But we would have got pwned because we didn't do research.

420
00:27:53,134 --> 00:28:02,635
Rym: besides that one article Yeah Cuz I'm still compiling all my evidence for when I finally do our thing on Why we hate the way the prison system works in the United States.

421
00:28:03,057 --> 00:28:12,731
Scott: fuck the police All right, so so so What are we gonna do this?

422
00:28:12,752 --> 00:28:13,560
Scott: What did we decide?

423
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:17,593
Rym: Well, we decided cuz it you know, we've done a lot of episodes of GeekNights.

424
00:28:17,673 --> 00:28:23,809
Rym: In fact, in fact, we've done 221 episodes of GeekNights not including number two to two.

425
00:28:24,129 --> 00:28:25,012
Rym: Yes, two to two.

426
00:28:25,513 --> 00:28:26,535
Rym: Ooh, very nice number.

427
00:28:26,696 --> 00:28:28,059
Scott: Yeah, very nice divisible by three.

428
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,068
Scott: Yeah, cool.

429
00:28:30,551 --> 00:28:32,684
Rym: Actually, I Impress someone.

430
00:28:32,704 --> 00:28:36,018
Rym: Well, I have a couple people in independent conversations recently.

431
00:28:36,078 --> 00:28:40,171
Rym: with that I'm gonna let you all in a little mathematical bit of magic.

432
00:28:40,232 --> 00:28:41,495
Rym: in case he didn't realize it.

433
00:28:42,017 --> 00:28:49,155
Rym: any number is Divisible by three if you can add up the digits of the number and that number is divisible by three.

434
00:28:49,676 --> 00:28:50,077
Scott: It's true.

435
00:28:50,097 --> 00:28:54,439
Rym: So Yeah, that's all I got to say about that.

436
00:28:55,405 --> 00:29:05,077
Rym: But yeah, we've done two hundred and twenty one Point-five episodes of GeekNights plus the six or seven beta episodes and all the stuff we did before.

437
00:29:05,117 --> 00:29:08,405
Rym: we even had a microphone And it's been a while.

438
00:29:08,505 --> 00:29:19,866
Rym: It's taken a lot out of us and I don't know we could talk about that in some kind of meta self introspective looking inward focused Meta blah, I said meta twice.

439
00:29:20,247 --> 00:29:22,554
Scott: Well, we've done 28 meta shows before.

440
00:29:22,574 --> 00:29:23,497
Scott: have we?

441
00:29:23,517 --> 00:29:24,340
Rym: I don't know.

442
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,836
Scott: It says meta discussion.

443
00:29:25,856 --> 00:29:26,180
Scott: You know what?

444
00:29:26,702 --> 00:29:35,799
Rym: I gotta go through and clean that up because honestly I Start originally I use tags in certain ways and I kind of use tags in different ways as the show went on.

445
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:40,475
Rym: So sometimes I would put a tag on an episode if we did a news about that topic.

446
00:29:40,836 --> 00:29:41,659
Rym: Sometimes I wouldn't.

447
00:29:42,401 --> 00:29:46,219
Rym: Lately, I've only been doing it if we did a long or an important news on that topic.

448
00:29:47,982 --> 00:29:49,192
Rym: Meta and site news.

449
00:29:49,232 --> 00:29:50,059
Rym: There's some overlap.

450
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,692
Rym: Yeah, I can fix that though.

451
00:29:52,973 --> 00:29:58,258
Rym: That was just me being lazy And I don't think one of those tags didn't exist right away and then I added it.

452
00:29:59,502 --> 00:30:03,040
Scott: Alright, so what do we got to say about us making?

453
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,037
Scott: 222 episodes of GeekNights.

454
00:30:05,118 --> 00:30:07,122
Rym: Yeah 222.

455
00:30:07,122 --> 00:30:14,720
Rym: I know a couple recent podcasts were happy about how they had almost broken a hundred and Not gonna gloat, but we're so awesome.

456
00:30:16,463 --> 00:30:18,078
Rym: Yeah, we're so totally awesome.

457
00:30:19,522 --> 00:30:21,958
Rym: Either that or we just really have no lives.

458
00:30:23,542 --> 00:30:28,319
Rym: We have lives, you know, we don't have shit to talk about, you know, we don't have fucking sleep.

459
00:30:29,186 --> 00:30:30,379
Scott: God, yeah, you know what?

460
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,566
Scott: I wake up every morning lately Like when my alarm goes off.

461
00:30:33,928 --> 00:30:36,580
Scott: I get up out of bed because my alarm is across the room.

462
00:30:36,981 --> 00:30:42,000
Scott: I turn the alarm off I get back in bed and I wake up like 10 minutes before I have to leave the house.

463
00:30:42,685 --> 00:30:44,136
Rym: I used to wake up at 6 o'clock.

464
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:51,461
Rym: Yeah, well except when I worked at IBM when I'd wake up at like 8 45 and roll into work around 9.

465
00:30:51,461 --> 00:30:52,365
Rym: Those were the days.

466
00:30:52,686 --> 00:31:03,884
Rym: but no now I get up at like 6 30 6 45 So I don't have time to shave or shower Properly and I run to the car because if I don't leave the house by 730 I'm totally fuck.

467
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:09,020
Rym: trying to drive in because everyone else who's running late is on the road and the people running late.

468
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,620
Rym: I'll drive like complete and total asshats.

469
00:31:12,501 --> 00:31:13,766
Scott: Yeah, I get up.

470
00:31:14,127 --> 00:31:15,312
Scott: I set my alarm for 630.

471
00:31:15,312 --> 00:31:18,742
Scott: I don't get up until 745.

472
00:31:18,742 --> 00:31:19,545
Scott: I gotta leave.

473
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:23,980
Scott: I'd like to leave at 8, but I've been leaving after late 8 a lot lately.

474
00:31:24,263 --> 00:31:25,496
Rym: So I guess here's something we can do.

475
00:31:25,961 --> 00:31:39,487
Rym: Let's kind of diagram a day in our lives from back before we did the podcast and a day in our lives now and then a Weekend from before and a weekend now just to illustrate to all of you out there who now we're not complaining Don't get us wrong.

476
00:31:39,528 --> 00:31:44,400
Rym: We love doing this but Doing a show like this has taken a lot out of us.

477
00:31:44,641 --> 00:31:55,300
Rym: And if you think that you could do if you want to do a podcast Just be advised that your life will be a little bit different if you're serious about it unless you do a weekly show.

478
00:31:55,821 --> 00:31:57,647
Rym: If we did a show we show.

479
00:31:57,707 --> 00:32:01,740
Rym: if we imagine if we did a weekly show, it'd be like two hours long and perfect.

480
00:32:02,283 --> 00:32:02,868
Scott: It's something like that.

481
00:32:02,908 --> 00:32:08,792
Rym: Yeah, maybe some month We'll take a month hiatus and just do a once a week like special episodes all month.

482
00:32:09,654 --> 00:32:10,296
Scott: I don't know.

483
00:32:10,456 --> 00:32:13,664
Rym: like in con season Maybe I don't know.

484
00:32:13,684 --> 00:32:15,170
Rym: I just got crazy ideas.

485
00:32:15,451 --> 00:32:19,484
Rym: I mean if we ever go out of town, you know, those aren't crazy ideas Those are lazy ideas.

486
00:32:19,685 --> 00:32:21,370
Rym: You know what crazy lazy.

487
00:32:21,571 --> 00:32:22,413
Rym: There's no difference.

488
00:32:22,433 --> 00:32:23,176
Rym: They're right there.

489
00:32:23,196 --> 00:32:24,540
Rym: They're almost the same.

490
00:32:25,142 --> 00:32:27,513
Scott: Practically the same letter makes a big difference.

491
00:32:27,533 --> 00:32:32,259
Rym: They're practically the same word Just like dick and mick.

492
00:32:33,364 --> 00:32:33,866
Rym: What the fuck?

493
00:32:33,946 --> 00:32:34,368
Rym: I don't know.

494
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:42,960
Rym: Yeah, so before we did the show I would you know, we go to work and we'd both be home by like four maybe five.

495
00:32:43,702 --> 00:32:51,220
Rym: We would cook dinner that took until about five forty five including eating and then we'd play video games for like two hours.

496
00:32:51,522 --> 00:32:53,719
Rym: We'd watch anime for like two hours.

497
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:58,332
Rym: We'd if anyone was around we'd play games with them and board games.

498
00:32:58,673 --> 00:32:59,676
Rym: I'd go out running.

499
00:32:59,816 --> 00:33:01,040
Rym: we'd ride bikes together.

500
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,224
Rym: I know so cute.

501
00:33:02,264 --> 00:33:04,751
Rym: We ride bikes together and every day was just.

502
00:33:05,092 --> 00:33:08,457
Rym: it got to the point where we didn't have enough to entertain Us in a given day.

503
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:17,884
Rym: Yeah We would sit there like nine o'clock at night bored because we'd already watched like four episodes of anime and we played every video game We wanted to play that day.

504
00:33:18,245 --> 00:33:22,519
Scott: Well, sometimes you would sit around for an hour or two just talking about bullshit.

505
00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:25,527
Rym: Wow Wow, I I can't.

506
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:28,377
Rym: it's so weird that we never just sit around anymore.

507
00:33:28,397 --> 00:33:31,450
Rym: Yeah Yeah, that's what I miss the most.

508
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:34,846
Scott: I think another thing is back in those days I was working in the city.

509
00:33:34,906 --> 00:33:37,340
Scott: So I'd get home later more like six something.

510
00:33:37,561 --> 00:33:40,210
Rym: Yeah, like when I usually sometimes even seven something.

511
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:43,040
Scott: now I get home at five something.

512
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,630
Rym: That's just cuz you show up at work late and you leave early.

513
00:33:46,052 --> 00:33:47,056
Scott: No one else is there.

514
00:33:47,156 --> 00:33:48,120
Scott: What are they gonna do about it?

515
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,103
Rym: I'd do the same thing.

516
00:33:49,424 --> 00:34:05,215
Rym: Yeah, but now well aside from the work issue because work changes just because we're Technologists and technology jobs tend to change a lot we get home we get in our hour Maybe an hour and a half of video gaming and internet doing.

517
00:34:05,757 --> 00:34:08,808
Rym: we cook dinner We do the pre-production for the show.

518
00:34:08,828 --> 00:34:10,172
Rym: We do the show.

519
00:34:10,192 --> 00:34:12,580
Rym: We read some manga and we go to sleep.

520
00:34:13,126 --> 00:34:14,119
Scott: That's pretty much what it is.

521
00:34:14,962 --> 00:34:26,619
Scott: The problem is we do a lot more cooking now than we used to actually and it takes time to cook and Usually there's something to do like dishes or some shit or some errand.

522
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,503
Scott: we go Or maybe it's a run to the grocery store Used to be.

523
00:34:29,523 --> 00:34:34,219
Scott: you could run to the grocery store cook dinner and have time to spare now if we do that.

524
00:34:34,561 --> 00:34:36,656
Scott: Well, no playing video games tonight.

525
00:34:36,998 --> 00:34:42,860
Scott: Yep So it's like I get home and I pretty much have until dinner to do anything fun.

526
00:34:43,864 --> 00:34:53,357
Scott: I can't sit on my computer at all or anything and we eat dinner We do the show and then maybe we have time to watch something while we eat.

527
00:34:53,578 --> 00:34:54,179
Scott: That's about it.

528
00:34:55,382 --> 00:34:59,394
Scott: After the show all I could do is lay in bed reading comics and then sleep.

529
00:34:59,735 --> 00:35:01,420
Rym: now the actual reality is that really?

530
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:05,900
Rym: We don't do much less when we're doing the show than we're not doing the show.

531
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,425
Rym: It's more that we seem.

532
00:35:07,445 --> 00:35:13,819
Rym: we lose a lot of the time between doing things where you Unravel a little bit and maybe relax.

533
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,585
Rym: Yeah, I mean we're.

534
00:35:16,786 --> 00:35:21,100
Rym: we get home and we immediately it's like alright, we got to start watching anime right now.

535
00:35:21,441 --> 00:35:28,640
Rym: Alright now I got to go run for 10 minutes while you do that thing And then we got to play excite truck before the show and oh we got to cook dinner.

536
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:34,696
Scott: Yeah, we you know, usually you spend a few minutes between things just sitting there thinking looking around.

537
00:35:34,736 --> 00:35:35,900
Scott: that doesn't exist anymore.

538
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,030
Scott: It's got a doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

539
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,340
Rym: Of course part of that is that in the last couple weeks?

540
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:46,100
Rym: We've been lazy and when we're doing pre-production for the show we end up putting all that time.

541
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:50,265
Rym: We would have spent doing nothing before we did the podcast Wedged into the time.

542
00:35:50,305 --> 00:35:51,510
Rym: we're trying to get the show ready.

543
00:35:51,872 --> 00:35:53,499
Rym: So we already know what we're gonna do.

544
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,266
Rym: We got the news.

545
00:35:54,286 --> 00:35:55,154
Rym: We got the things of the day.

546
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:55,800
Rym: We got the topic.

547
00:35:55,860 --> 00:36:01,237
Rym: We're ready to go and we sit there for 45 minutes watching Family Guy and Simpsons clips on YouTube.

548
00:36:01,878 --> 00:36:02,380
Scott: That is true.

549
00:36:02,442 --> 00:36:03,077
Scott: We just did that.

550
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:10,679
Rym: We do seem to waste a lot more time looking at internet shit under the guise of working on the podcast Even though we don't use any of that stuff in the show.

551
00:36:11,021 --> 00:36:17,120
Scott: Well, usually it's like as soon as we know everything we're gonna do on the show, you know, and we found news.

552
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:20,431
Scott: We found things of the day and we found the topic.

553
00:36:20,832 --> 00:36:23,220
Scott: we do the show immediately as soon as that's all set.

554
00:36:23,561 --> 00:36:30,280
Scott: Yeah, what we'll do is we'll be looking for things of the day and that's when we'll start watching videos on YouTube and wasting time.

555
00:36:30,543 --> 00:36:32,120
Scott: We won't know a main topic.

556
00:36:32,501 --> 00:36:37,200
Scott: So we'll look to our computers for inspiration and start watching videos on YouTube or playing flash.

557
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:44,734
Rym: But it's definitely subtle Subconscious procrastination because oftentimes we need a topic and we just watch Family Guy crap.

558
00:36:44,754 --> 00:36:47,486
Rym: That's not going to inspire us or Will it?

559
00:36:47,627 --> 00:36:48,454
Rym: No, it never has.

560
00:36:48,575 --> 00:37:00,979
Rym: play Jerusalem You can't plagiarize ten plagiarism owes anyway, I Just realized I hadn't make that you can't blank ten blank joke recently and I had to bring it back.

561
00:37:01,421 --> 00:37:03,574
Rym: All right, because I think that's gonna be our first t-shirt.

562
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:05,685
Scott: You can't hold ten Pokemon You can't make ten.

563
00:37:05,705 --> 00:37:06,730
Rym: you can't make ten jokes.

564
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:08,539
Rym: ten jokes make what the fuck.

565
00:37:09,262 --> 00:37:13,052
Rym: I realized that if you try to recurse that joke, it becomes infinitely recursive.

566
00:37:13,553 --> 00:37:14,115
Scott: Yeah.

567
00:37:14,636 --> 00:37:14,857
Rym: Oh, no.

568
00:37:14,897 --> 00:37:15,760
Rym: No, wait, I can break it.

569
00:37:16,261 --> 00:37:16,582
Scott: I got it.

570
00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:17,484
Scott: You can't make ten.

571
00:37:17,504 --> 00:37:18,246
Rym: make ten jokes.

572
00:37:18,808 --> 00:37:20,553
Rym: Yeah, you can't make ten.

573
00:37:20,573 --> 00:37:23,897
Rym: You can't make ten jokes ten joke Damn it.

574
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,131
Rym: Let's hear your option your way.

575
00:37:26,412 --> 00:37:27,980
Scott: Well, it's you can't blank, right?

576
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:33,139
Scott: So it's you can't you can't you can't you can't you can't you can't you can't you can't you can't you can't you can't etc.

577
00:37:33,724 --> 00:37:35,600
Rym: Well, yeah, if you do a pure recursion, yes.

578
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,371
Scott: and then if the recursion is, you know doesn't have a stopper.

579
00:37:38,391 --> 00:37:42,248
Scott: and then if there's a as soon as it's Finishes out right?

580
00:37:42,389 --> 00:37:50,800
Scott: It's if one you can't As soon as it breaks out of that, you know downward spiral, it's you can't.

581
00:37:52,424 --> 00:37:56,240
Scott: Eventually, you can't make ten except break can't you can't you can't.

582
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:03,509
Rym: Breaking out of that downward spiral is like breaking out of a point zero repeating with a one at the end of it You're never gonna get to that one.

583
00:38:03,569 --> 00:38:04,355
Rym: That one's not there.

584
00:38:04,376 --> 00:38:06,686
Scott: I know That's kind of the point.

585
00:38:07,028 --> 00:38:07,330
Rym: Wow.

586
00:38:07,792 --> 00:38:09,040
Rym: Yeah that that wasted some time.

587
00:38:11,102 --> 00:38:12,006
Rym: See that's the problem.

588
00:38:12,227 --> 00:38:20,226
Rym: when we try to be unstructured we just kind of talk about the stuff We would have talked about if there were no microphones around Which you guys seem to find entertaining.

589
00:38:20,346 --> 00:38:23,054
Rym: So now I'll get back on topic.

590
00:38:23,716 --> 00:38:33,707
Rym: that in itself that Busyness from the fact that we do the show wouldn't really affect our lives that much because one Friday through Sunday We have infinite free time.

591
00:38:34,089 --> 00:38:35,293
Rym: or we did.

592
00:38:35,694 --> 00:38:42,780
Rym: you see when he first started doing the show It didn't matter that we did the show all week because we lived out here pretty much alone.

593
00:38:43,262 --> 00:38:45,952
Rym: None of our friends lived really anywhere near us.

594
00:38:46,414 --> 00:38:51,298
Scott: So we it's like every weekend We would drive down to the mall play a bunch of DDR.

595
00:38:52,102 --> 00:38:55,519
Rym: Yeah, we used to drive to the mall and play initial D for like an hour.

596
00:38:55,962 --> 00:38:58,092
Scott: Yeah, we used to do all kinds of weird stuff around here.

597
00:38:58,112 --> 00:38:59,620
Scott: We go to the anime store all the time.

598
00:39:00,062 --> 00:39:00,785
Scott: Media play.

599
00:39:00,806 --> 00:39:02,514
Scott: remember that media play was still in business.

600
00:39:02,554 --> 00:39:03,860
Rym: Yeah, then it was going out of business.

601
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,292
Rym: We kept going up there to buy the ever-increasingly discounted crack.

602
00:39:07,312 --> 00:39:08,516
Scott: Yeah, we did all kinds of stuff.

603
00:39:08,536 --> 00:39:12,206
Scott: We went, you know now it's like Down the road one day.

604
00:39:12,246 --> 00:39:13,650
Rym: I even took Scott mountain biking.

605
00:39:14,071 --> 00:39:14,272
Scott: Yeah.

606
00:39:14,834 --> 00:39:16,940
Scott: Anyway, we did all kinds of crazy shit.

607
00:39:17,161 --> 00:39:20,279
Rym: Oh, yeah, but weekends were totally relaxing and totally free.

608
00:39:20,461 --> 00:39:25,631
Rym: I mean other than con season which Didn't hit us so bad back then because we didn't go to that many.

609
00:39:25,672 --> 00:39:27,940
Rym: we went to like maybe five or six cons back then.

610
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:30,668
Rym: Yeah, which I mean we had every weekend was free.

611
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:34,240
Rym: I'd wake up at like 11. we do whatever we wanted.

612
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,372
Rym: We stay up until like for playing video games.

613
00:39:36,392 --> 00:39:37,679
Rym: We sleep till noon the next day.

614
00:39:38,382 --> 00:39:41,171
Rym: Now all our friends live out near us.

615
00:39:41,553 --> 00:39:47,400
Rym: not that we're really complaining because it's kind of awesome No, but now we're just constantly doing shit on the weekend.

616
00:39:47,922 --> 00:39:48,725
Scott: It's like before.

617
00:39:48,745 --> 00:39:52,320
Scott: you know, it's like I need to go to Home Depot to buy something.

618
00:39:52,401 --> 00:39:53,951
Scott: Well on the weekend I could just go.

619
00:39:54,011 --> 00:39:54,756
Scott: it'd be all easy.

620
00:39:55,099 --> 00:39:57,208
Scott: now It's like I gotta run around and get.

621
00:39:57,248 --> 00:39:59,960
Scott: there's no time to get the shit done even on the weekend.

622
00:40:00,381 --> 00:40:05,380
Scott: I mean, let's say I need to take days off work if I need to go down the road to get like household goods.

623
00:40:05,621 --> 00:40:14,956
Rym: I mean we have people come over to our house or we go over to someone else's house or we go to a con Every weekend like if I need to do laundry, oh shit.

624
00:40:15,177 --> 00:40:15,680
Rym: Oh laundry.

625
00:40:17,121 --> 00:40:23,081
Rym: There was a time when the thing is and this is the one thing that really scares me and reminds me of how awesome college Was.

626
00:40:23,703 --> 00:40:28,360
Rym: we had even less time in college free really than we do now.

627
00:40:29,521 --> 00:40:31,909
Rym: Mmm, the only difference was in college.

628
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:35,140
Rym: We could skip our responsibilities in order to have fun.

629
00:40:35,742 --> 00:40:38,653
Rym: I can't skip work in order to have fun on a regular basis.

630
00:40:39,174 --> 00:40:40,640
Rym: I could skip class whenever I wanted.

631
00:40:41,084 --> 00:40:48,820
Scott: Yeah, the other thing is in college There was a lot of time between classes like I remember when I watched all of Matt cross one episode a day.

632
00:40:49,242 --> 00:40:55,453
Scott: I would watch that episode around lunchtime You know, I had my class schedule set up where it's like every day.

633
00:40:55,473 --> 00:41:01,520
Scott: I would be home at lunch I would get I'd like make a sandwich watch one episode and then go back to classes.

634
00:41:02,022 --> 00:41:06,740
Scott: Yeah, I don't have that like our breaks in the middle of the day to do stuff at home.

635
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:18,059
Scott: I mean, I'm at work I can do whatever I want there pretty much because no one else is there But I'm not at home and I can't like go out to the store or because there really aren't any stores over there.

636
00:41:18,661 --> 00:41:19,925
Scott: So it's really limiting.

637
00:41:20,045 --> 00:41:24,820
Scott: All I can do at work is do something on the internet or read something or play a DS game.

638
00:41:24,921 --> 00:41:25,243
Scott: That's it.

639
00:41:25,707 --> 00:41:27,159
Scott: It really limiting the options.

640
00:41:27,346 --> 00:41:28,925
Rym: Yeah I mean we really feel it.

641
00:41:29,005 --> 00:41:37,282
Rym: on Friday when we don't have to do a show we come home from work and we're sitting there We're watching anime and we realize that we're free Free.

642
00:41:37,382 --> 00:41:42,039
Rym: we can do whatever we want until everyone comes over to hang out like an hour later.

643
00:41:42,923 --> 00:41:46,880
Scott: Yeah, well the show's affected us in other ways besides yeah taking up time.

644
00:41:47,402 --> 00:41:59,458
Rym: Well, the way I've looked at it is that when we were in college, I mean not to self-aggrandize Really not at all, but we had a wide circle of friends, you know The front row crew was very tight and we did stuff together all the time.

645
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:08,059
Rym: but we also ran that anime club with its hundreds of members and Not that we had fans or anything like that.

646
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:17,773
Rym: But there was a large large body of people who knew us among a tiny Tiny group of very specific fan oriented people.

647
00:42:18,114 --> 00:42:20,160
Rym: we were tiny minor celebrities.

648
00:42:20,765 --> 00:42:22,800
Scott: We had a large network of acquaintances.

649
00:42:23,021 --> 00:42:25,993
Scott: Like there were a lot of people who fell into that category of like.

650
00:42:26,013 --> 00:42:29,569
Scott: hey, I know that guy that guy knows me What's up, but we're not really friends.

651
00:42:29,609 --> 00:42:30,594
Scott: They don't call each other.

652
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:31,820
Scott: I am each other or anything.

653
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:37,370
Rym: Yeah, like I never called Mitch or hung out with Mitch But I was there cheering when Mitch took on the one gallon challenge.

654
00:42:37,671 --> 00:42:38,915
Scott: I knew Mitch freshman year.

655
00:42:39,035 --> 00:42:39,938
Rym: Everyone knew Mitch.

656
00:42:39,998 --> 00:42:42,905
Scott: Yeah You know, they're a bunch of.

657
00:42:42,985 --> 00:42:44,110
Scott: we knew a lot of people.

658
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:54,520
Scott: but now, you know when you move to a new place You know your people who are your close friends will stay in contact But those that acquaintance network is pretty much disintegrated as soon as you move away.

659
00:42:54,769 --> 00:43:01,649
Rym: Yeah and I'll admit that it was kind of a blow that I went from having this club with hundreds of people in it.

660
00:43:01,951 --> 00:43:07,143
Rym: who would you know, they They would come to this thing and I would be at the front of the room and they would listen to everything I said.

661
00:43:07,163 --> 00:43:12,108
Rym: if they saw me when I was walking down the street They'd be like hey Rym blah blah blah.

662
00:43:12,168 --> 00:43:14,537
Rym: and I always thought god damn it you fanboys.

663
00:43:14,577 --> 00:43:15,440
Rym: Just leave me alone.

664
00:43:15,542 --> 00:43:16,498
Rym: I'm trying to go to class.

665
00:43:17,082 --> 00:43:21,238
Rym: But then when I didn't have that anymore after about a week, I started missing it.

666
00:43:22,001 --> 00:43:24,229
Rym: I miss those fanboys and I wanted.

667
00:43:24,249 --> 00:43:24,911
Rym: I wanted that.

668
00:43:25,011 --> 00:43:25,955
Scott: I don't miss the fanboys.

669
00:43:26,015 --> 00:43:27,520
Scott: I miss the non fanboys.

670
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,724
Scott: Yeah, this just you know.

671
00:43:28,784 --> 00:43:29,226
Scott: seeing.

672
00:43:29,286 --> 00:43:33,360
Scott: you know, it was good to walk around a place where there's lots of people, you know.

673
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,848
Scott: Instead of nowadays, I don't see people during the day.

674
00:43:35,868 --> 00:43:36,992
Scott: I don't see anyone.

675
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:39,099
Scott: so it was good to just see people.

676
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:47,659
Scott: and You know if I needed if I wanted to talk to someone, you know Usually if I walk around for ten minutes, I'm gonna find someone and be like, hey, what's up?

677
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:53,600
Rym: Yeah, I mean on any given moment we like if one of us didn't have class we'd wander into one of the eateries on campus.

678
00:43:53,962 --> 00:43:56,599
Rym: We're almost guaranteed to run into someone to hang out with.

679
00:43:57,121 --> 00:44:09,420
Scott: Yeah, and then nowadays if we go to a restaurant, you know, we're gonna be the only people there We know is us unless it's a restaurant We frequent often in which the waiters will know who we are or one of them are a few places like that.

680
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,850
Scott: But you know, there's not.

681
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:11,252
Scott: it's not like.

682
00:44:11,272 --> 00:44:12,299
Scott: hey, man, what's up?

683
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:19,420
Scott: We know you but in college, you could walk in anywhere and be like, hey, I know you let's sit together and talk about something.

684
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:26,140
Rym: Yep, plus being at college and being in these clubs and having this social network gave us an in into a lot of things.

685
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:39,539
Rym: I mean we started getting into conventions free and We started like I started giving speeches and doing panels to anime cons years and years and years ago just because I had this in from you know, the college and the people I knew and the campus and the club.

686
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:43,360
Rym: and Once you graduate you realize that you don't have access to that anymore.

687
00:44:43,927 --> 00:44:44,939
Rym: I mean, what was I gonna say?

688
00:44:45,241 --> 00:44:54,095
Rym: You know now if I didn't have GeekNights and I tried to go back to cons and be like, hey Let me run a panel at your con or let me be staff at your con.

689
00:44:54,597 --> 00:44:55,500
Rym: What's your experience?

690
00:44:56,203 --> 00:44:57,930
Rym: Three to five years ago.

691
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:00,220
Rym: I was the president of an anime club.

692
00:45:01,102 --> 00:45:02,248
Rym: What have you done since then?

693
00:45:02,812 --> 00:45:04,180
Rym: work nine-to-five?

694
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:05,780
Rym: going nowhere.

695
00:45:07,682 --> 00:45:10,200
Scott: Yeah, GeekNights has sort of been the replacement for that.

696
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,047
Scott: Yeah, how we do something?

697
00:45:12,108 --> 00:45:18,380
Scott: therefore we're worth something and we have an acquaintance network And we have a forum where people talk to us.

698
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:21,340
Rym: Yeah And I got to say we've met a lot of cool people doing GeekNights.

699
00:45:21,561 --> 00:45:24,077
Rym: Most of you people in the forums are super awesome.

700
00:45:24,278 --> 00:45:26,572
Rym: most You know who you are.

701
00:45:29,163 --> 00:45:31,139
Scott: But seriously, I mean we can't be ten cool people.

702
00:45:31,681 --> 00:45:35,375
Rym: We've met a bunch of you at various conventions and you guys are all.

703
00:45:35,575 --> 00:45:36,840
Rym: we've never met one of you.

704
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,259
Rym: That was not at least above the level of being cool.

705
00:45:40,901 --> 00:45:46,238
Scott: Another thing is that we've entered sort of like the podcast community or like not the big podcast community.

706
00:45:46,278 --> 00:45:46,940
Scott: most podcasters.

707
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:48,634
Scott: There's no clue about GeekNights.

708
00:45:48,694 --> 00:45:49,320
Scott: We're not big time.

709
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:58,500
Rym: I believe you mean the anime world order Ninja Consultants fast karate for the gentleman night shift half I happy house a hentai podcast community.

710
00:45:59,142 --> 00:46:03,680
Scott: Also, there are a few others that were loosely tied to like board games to go actually movies.

711
00:46:05,287 --> 00:46:07,096
Rym: Actually, no, it's the exact opposite of a bit shit.

712
00:46:07,116 --> 00:46:07,940
Rym: I love that podcast.

713
00:46:08,881 --> 00:46:09,464
Scott: Comic geek.

714
00:46:09,484 --> 00:46:10,569
Scott: guys know who we are.

715
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:12,700
Scott: Yeah, you know, there's a few podcasts.

716
00:46:12,801 --> 00:46:22,915
Scott: There's a lot of people, you know If we didn't make a podcast like I would be a listener of their shows Maybe because I wouldn't have known about anime world order anything.

717
00:46:22,955 --> 00:46:23,879
Scott: if I you know, they hadn't.

718
00:46:23,939 --> 00:46:32,973
Rym: yeah The only reason we even knew anything about anime world order is because Daryl Surratt Randomly interviewed me at Katsucon while I was a little bit drunk.

719
00:46:33,354 --> 00:46:33,615
Scott: Yeah.

720
00:46:33,776 --> 00:46:38,715
Rym: Yeah, and I first I was like What's this guy trying to do a podcast or something?

721
00:46:39,116 --> 00:46:39,659
Rym: What's this?

722
00:46:40,616 --> 00:46:43,851
Scott: No Hey, you're a podcaster at the time.

723
00:46:43,991 --> 00:46:45,800
Rym: Yeah, but I didn't have a recording bit or anything.

724
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:49,293
Rym: I wasn't GeekNights was hardly professional back then.

725
00:46:49,313 --> 00:46:49,935
Scott: No, it wasn't.

726
00:46:49,975 --> 00:46:51,160
Scott: Well, it's hardly professional now.

727
00:46:51,664 --> 00:46:55,060
Rym: Yeah, it's more professional than say other podcasts.

728
00:46:56,444 --> 00:46:59,740
Rym: See, I'd say here's the thing We're more professional than fast karate.

729
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:03,392
Rym: But that is not in any way disparaging to fast karate because they're.

730
00:47:03,492 --> 00:47:05,499
Rym: unprofessionalism is what makes their podcast.

731
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:07,908
Scott: Awesome It really depends on the podcast.

732
00:47:07,928 --> 00:47:11,059
Scott: how much professionalism you need or you should.

733
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:11,581
Scott: you know A lot.

734
00:47:11,621 --> 00:47:21,260
Scott: the best kind of podcast really in the world would be where everything is ultra professional But no one can tell because you're unprofessional on purpose.

735
00:47:21,521 --> 00:47:26,278
Rym: Well, like the audio quality is good and perfect, but the people are just schmucks like us.

736
00:47:26,679 --> 00:47:29,786
Scott: Yeah Yeah Well, you don't even need the perfect audio quality.

737
00:47:29,826 --> 00:47:38,214
Scott: like you can have perfect audio equipment and then intentionally like get the unprofessional sound Professionally, yeah, you know see I don't.

738
00:47:38,274 --> 00:47:39,260
Rym: I don't like things like that.

739
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:42,359
Rym: I'd rather just every podcast be perfect perfect audio.

740
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:47,255
Rym: That'd be good too because hearing something sound professional doesn't rub me the wrong way like it does some people.

741
00:47:47,275 --> 00:47:53,160
Scott: Yeah, whatever It depends really, you know some things, you know need to sound a certain way.

742
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:53,882
Scott: You know, it's like.

743
00:47:54,244 --> 00:47:54,725
Scott: it's like.

744
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:58,477
Scott: I think of it like making 8-bit music, you know as opposed to making 16-bit music.

745
00:47:59,581 --> 00:48:02,911
Rym: Yeah, I'll follow that but just don't tread into the realm of.

746
00:48:03,352 --> 00:48:07,209
Rym: I put film grain into my digital film For artistic reasons.

747
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:08,417
Scott: No, that's a bad move.

748
00:48:08,477 --> 00:48:08,940
Scott: That's a bad.

749
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:14,240
Scott: That's kind of the same thing is I'm thinking more like make a black-and-white movie with the highest end video equipment.

750
00:48:14,341 --> 00:48:15,168
Scott: You know something like that.

751
00:48:15,188 --> 00:48:22,620
Rym: That's what I'm talking about Yeah, but just I mean all these cool people we've met as a result of podcasting like HD black-and-white movie.

752
00:48:22,801 --> 00:48:25,400
Rym: But like remember we had those the two wonderful movies.

753
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:29,638
Rym: You see people were guests on our show and they did a guest episode of GeekNights.

754
00:48:29,859 --> 00:48:31,579
Scott: Yeah No one else wanted to the bums.

755
00:48:31,921 --> 00:48:38,023
Rym: No, we had a few people who wanted to but they were probably the best people to do it at the time and the most Professional.

756
00:48:38,183 --> 00:48:39,910
Scott: and yeah, they did a good job.

757
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:51,092
Scott: Like I was it was cool cuz you know Yeah, I was all excited to hear whatever they had to say what they were gonna do, you know It's cooler than listening to your own show being done by someone else.

758
00:48:51,674 --> 00:48:55,866
Scott: Yeah, it's kind of weird though It's like it's a pretty good podcast.

759
00:48:55,906 --> 00:49:04,516
Rym: Like I'll listen to it if I don't have anything else to listen to I've done that Cuz I forget what I say on the show and I go back and listen to.

760
00:49:04,556 --> 00:49:08,193
Rym: it's like wow That was kind of funny or what?

761
00:49:08,213 --> 00:49:09,739
Rym: What the fuck was I talking about?

762
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:13,134
Scott: Usually are we talking about?

763
00:49:13,355 --> 00:49:13,798
Rym: I don't know.

764
00:49:14,682 --> 00:49:15,264
Rym: It's Thursday.

765
00:49:15,304 --> 00:49:16,307
Rym: We can do whatever we want.

766
00:49:16,367 --> 00:49:18,954
Rym: Thursday is the least subscribed to night of GeekNights.

767
00:49:19,717 --> 00:49:20,800
Scott: So sad Thursday.

768
00:49:22,101 --> 00:49:27,195
Rym: Well by least subscribed I mean it has 20 less listeners than the rest of GeekNights.

769
00:49:27,697 --> 00:49:28,800
Scott: Where are those 20 people?

770
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,100
Scott: They think I listen I.

771
00:49:31,661 --> 00:49:38,580
Rym: There are 33 people who are regularly subscribed to Thursday, but that doesn't count, you know the hundred.

772
00:49:39,262 --> 00:49:41,390
Scott: It's 30 people who listen to Thursday only.

773
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:43,537
Rym: Well, they might be subscribed to like Monday Thursday.

774
00:49:43,598 --> 00:49:43,959
Rym: I don't know.

775
00:49:44,501 --> 00:49:48,582
Scott: Hey if anyone listens to Thursday only Say something.

776
00:49:48,862 --> 00:49:50,164
Rym: Yeah, leave us an audio.

777
00:49:50,204 --> 00:49:51,206
Rym: I'm curious about that.

778
00:49:51,667 --> 00:49:55,816
Scott: Yeah, I think that's another thing with the podcasting is

779
00:49:57,340 --> 00:49:58,303
Rym: Yeah,

780
00:49:58,323 --> 00:49:59,044
Scott: yeah,

781
00:49:59,566 --> 00:50:00,689
Rym: yeah used

782
00:50:00,729 --> 00:50:01,531
Scott: to forget before

783
00:50:01,912 --> 00:50:17,978
Rym: but like we have these hundreds and hundreds of people who listen to the whole week At least they subscribe to the whole feed and then we have all the feeds for the different days and the hits to those feeds very wildly and You know what if you use those specialized feeds, let us know.

784
00:50:17,998 --> 00:50:18,540
Rym: We're just curious.

785
00:50:19,162 --> 00:50:23,419
Scott: I know a few people use and there's a lot of people going for that Tuesday only feed a lot of them.

786
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,024
Rym: Yeah, that's our most popular feed.

787
00:50:25,385 --> 00:50:27,612
Scott: Well, no the the everything feed is the most.

788
00:50:27,652 --> 00:50:30,120
Rym: well, it's our most popular individual day feed.

789
00:50:30,401 --> 00:50:43,893
Rym: Yeah, even though the feed it's amazing that half of you In fact, sometimes more than half of you download the show manually from the website or from a podcast Site instead of using a pod catcher.

790
00:50:43,913 --> 00:50:45,620
Scott: You should use a pod catcher.

791
00:50:45,901 --> 00:50:50,100
Rym: Yeah, if you're downloading the site or the GeekNights from the website every day, that's awesome.

792
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:52,992
Rym: But you might be better off using a pod catcher.

793
00:50:53,374 --> 00:50:54,840
Rym: It'll make your life a lot easier.

794
00:50:55,062 --> 00:50:57,240
Scott: Yeah, I don't really care how you get the show.

795
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:02,480
Scott: I mean, that's why we make it available in so many different ways, but it's probably better for you.

796
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:03,745
Scott: I'm trying to help you out here.

797
00:51:03,765 --> 00:51:05,795
Scott: Your pod catchers make things easy.

798
00:51:05,975 --> 00:51:06,498
Scott: There's a reason.

799
00:51:06,518 --> 00:51:15,573
Rym: they exist of course, we only have the most recent 100 episodes in the feed and Episodes before that are getting a lot of downloads.

800
00:51:15,633 --> 00:51:17,100
Rym: So you guys are going through the archives.

801
00:51:17,561 --> 00:51:19,589
Scott: Yeah, I don't understand if you will go through the archives.

802
00:51:19,649 --> 00:51:21,878
Rym: I go through the archives of every podcast I listen to.

803
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:22,380
Scott: I've listened.

804
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:27,153
Scott: There's some podcast where you can go through the archives and some that you just shouldn't.

805
00:51:27,274 --> 00:51:30,204
Rym: well apparently ours you can because everyone does it I know.

806
00:51:30,324 --> 00:51:34,240
Scott: but if I was a GeekNights listener, I would not go through the archive.

807
00:51:34,401 --> 00:51:35,351
Rym: I would you know what I do.

808
00:51:35,412 --> 00:51:36,220
Rym: I'd go through the website.

809
00:51:36,341 --> 00:51:38,040
Rym: Maybe this is why we get so many web downloads.

810
00:51:38,582 --> 00:51:42,920
Rym: I would go to the website and search for things I want to hear about because odds are it's in there.

811
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,667
Scott: Oh, yeah, I mean I would go and get.

812
00:51:44,687 --> 00:51:47,277
Scott: I wouldn't listen to the whole archive straight through.

813
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:47,920
Scott: is what I'm saying?

814
00:51:48,201 --> 00:51:48,783
Rym: Well, you know what?

815
00:51:48,803 --> 00:51:52,800
Scott: I would get some choice episodes out of there, but I definitely would not listen to everything.

816
00:51:53,001 --> 00:51:55,388
Rym: I've listened to almost the whole archive of movies.

817
00:51:55,408 --> 00:51:58,016
Scott: You should see that's not the biggest archive.

818
00:51:58,056 --> 00:51:59,460
Rym: fast karate for the gentleman.

819
00:52:00,042 --> 00:52:01,125
Rym: Anime world order.

820
00:52:01,145 --> 00:52:02,368
Scott: I never will order.

821
00:52:02,388 --> 00:52:04,113
Scott: you can listen to all of pretty easily.

822
00:52:04,555 --> 00:52:07,405
Rym: Yeah, and NPR a lot of that stuff I've got.

823
00:52:07,425 --> 00:52:07,746
Scott: NPR wouldn't.

824
00:52:07,907 --> 00:52:09,636
Scott: well, it depends on the show on NPR.

825
00:52:09,837 --> 00:52:10,520
Rym: NPR politics.

826
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:12,306
Rym: I went back through as much of as I could get.

827
00:52:12,527 --> 00:52:13,551
Scott: Wow, that's scary.

828
00:52:13,771 --> 00:52:14,935
Rym: I like NVR politics.

829
00:52:14,996 --> 00:52:18,774
Scott: It's only 10 minutes long I'm just saying like onion radio news.

830
00:52:18,895 --> 00:52:21,646
Scott: I've gone through Too many of them.

831
00:52:21,746 --> 00:52:24,440
Rym: I've gone through much of the pendulette podcast archives.

832
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:29,200
Scott: Yeah, it's another one where I would just go through and get some choice episodes and not listen to all of them.

833
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,927
Rym: But yeah, anyway, I don't know.

834
00:52:31,028 --> 00:52:32,474
Rym: We weren't really trying to say anything.

835
00:52:32,494 --> 00:52:33,559
Rym: We were just kind of rambling.

836
00:52:34,021 --> 00:52:35,450
Scott: I guess you had nothing better to do today.

837
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:36,335
Scott: What do you want from us?

838
00:52:36,657 --> 00:52:40,860
Rym: Yeah, it's been Two hundred and twenty one point nine episodes of GeekNights.

839
00:52:41,782 --> 00:52:43,612
Rym: I mean that's kind of crazy.

840
00:52:43,632 --> 00:52:45,060
Rym: even every whenever I think about it.

841
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:51,936
Rym: I mean I look at the gigabytes and gigabytes of GeekNights archives I have on this computer and it's kind of staggering that I that we did that.

842
00:52:51,956 --> 00:52:55,308
Scott: All right, so Ignites, it's the second season.

843
00:52:55,488 --> 00:52:58,060
Scott: It's a second season is about a month old now, right?

844
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:01,935
Rym: Yep, as the new year comes a lot of stuff is going to happen.

845
00:53:02,055 --> 00:53:03,300
Rym: We're gonna update the website.

846
00:53:03,803 --> 00:53:11,240
Scott: Yeah, I mean it's gonna be the holidays in a couple weeks You know, this is gonna be like the GeekNights mellow month of December, right?

847
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:19,089
Scott: And then we're gonna have you know, a big New Year's party that we always have and everything, you know in January Expect like GeekNights double renewal.

848
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:22,700
Scott: We're gonna start, you know doing a push for more listeners.

849
00:53:22,801 --> 00:53:26,000
Scott: We're gonna hopefully, you know get the website nicer.

850
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:30,394
Rym: Yeah, we're gonna get our artists to finish the site design and we're gonna run an exchange.

851
00:53:30,414 --> 00:53:32,440
Scott: We're gonna start selling swag.

852
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,878
Scott: We're gonna come out with the DVDs.

853
00:53:34,181 --> 00:53:34,903
Scott: We're gonna do all.

854
00:53:34,943 --> 00:53:44,149
Rym: that awesome shit is coming up early next year and it better come early next year because also early next year Is con season dumb dumb dumb.

855
00:53:44,169 --> 00:53:49,113
Rym: see it used to be that con season for us was the summer And that was pretty much it.

856
00:53:49,133 --> 00:53:49,900
Rym: like we go to Katsu.

857
00:53:50,182 --> 00:53:56,192
Rym: I'd go to Katsu con and then we'd have con season which was like March through August and even then it was on.

858
00:53:56,212 --> 00:53:59,420
Scott: season was really February through November.

859
00:54:00,561 --> 00:54:03,589
Rym: Well, no September September it's February through September.

860
00:54:03,629 --> 00:54:06,857
Rym: so we get October November December and we January.

861
00:54:06,897 --> 00:54:08,100
Rym: we might lose January.

862
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,345
Scott: How are you gonna lose January?

863
00:54:09,385 --> 00:54:13,119
Scott: Cuz well, you know what the New York Comic Con is in January and generic on.

864
00:54:14,781 --> 00:54:19,197
Scott: Yeah, it begins con season most of the year always.

865
00:54:19,398 --> 00:54:24,240
Rym: Yep Also expect us to be doing a lot more at cons.

866
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:29,586
Rym: I mean this last year we had most cons where we did stuff we tended to do Podcasting stuff.

867
00:54:30,029 --> 00:54:30,250
Scott: Mm-hmm.

868
00:54:30,712 --> 00:54:37,358
Rym: We're gonna do a lot more Non-podcasting stuff because no one wants to hear another panel on what a podcast is.

869
00:54:37,378 --> 00:54:44,926
Scott: Yeah All right, so all you GeekNights listeners out there like, you know, get ready Yeah, and you know what?

870
00:54:45,087 --> 00:54:52,293
Rym: Thanks for listening cuz it's just awesome that you guys all listen to us Rant late into the night about often useless bullshit.

871
00:54:52,574 --> 00:54:53,698
Scott: I think you're just fucking crazy.

872
00:54:53,738 --> 00:54:54,240
Scott: I know it's wrong.

873
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:19,200
Rym: I Guess I'll end this with probably the most fitting anecdote that one of the reasons we decided to do a Podcast we've talked about this before was that when we made a bunch of new friends when they were freshmen at RIT but we were like juniors and seniors and they'd come over to our house or sleep in our apartment and They'd see us talking to each other in the bedroom and our separate beds while they were trying to go to sleep.

874
00:55:19,663 --> 00:55:21,600
Scott: And well, they see us talking at all.

875
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:28,807
Scott: We just had normal conversations in the living room and they were perfectly normal conversations to us But everyone else is laughing hysterically.

876
00:55:29,309 --> 00:55:31,920
Rym: So we realized that maybe we're funny.

877
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:41,076
Scott: Hey If we just talk the way we normally talk other people seem to really be Entertained so much so that they have nothing to say except they sit there and laugh and are happy.

878
00:55:41,557 --> 00:55:46,576
Rym: So yeah Yeah, maybe we'll turn this into an annual GeekNights retrospective.

879
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:47,038
Rym: I don't know.

880
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:48,684
Rym: May.

881
00:55:48,725 --> 00:55:52,940
Rym: maybe we'll turn it into a semi monthly one depending on how lazy we are with Thursday shows.

882
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:57,112
Scott: Yeah I got a few ideas of things that we should do in the near future.

883
00:55:57,192 --> 00:56:02,833
Scott: like every other podcast seems to do contest I think we can come up with a better contest system.

884
00:56:02,873 --> 00:56:03,797
Scott: another podcast do.

885
00:56:03,857 --> 00:56:04,460
Scott: I'm working on that.

886
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,780
Rym: Oh, you mean like anime world orders contest where they just randomly pick names.

887
00:56:08,042 --> 00:56:10,740
Scott: I'm thinking there people do better contest than that.

888
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:14,680
Scott: But I think GeekNights can have the best contest of any podcast out there.

889
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:18,254
Rym: We'd have a contest like we'll get our friend Conrad love a contest contest.

890
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:19,840
Scott: you can come up with the best contest you win.

891
00:56:20,181 --> 00:56:21,709
Rym: No, no, what do you win?

892
00:56:21,729 --> 00:56:22,633
Rym: the contest?

893
00:56:22,653 --> 00:56:23,336
Rym: you get to run it?

894
00:56:23,357 --> 00:56:23,718
Rym: I don't know.

895
00:56:23,879 --> 00:56:26,500
Scott: No No, and we're gonna come up with some good stuff there.

896
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:32,220
Rym: And yeah, plus one thing we're gonna be doing that a lot of people have asked us about is we're lining up.

897
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:37,160
Rym: I know we said this before and we did have all the these interviews lined up, but we just didn't do them.

898
00:56:37,622 --> 00:56:39,794
Rym: We're gonna actually follow through and interview all these people.

899
00:56:39,835 --> 00:56:50,500
Rym: we keep saying we will Because I mean it's fun to have us on the show all the time But it's nice to break it up And I think we've got some really cool people that we may or may not have on the show in the coming months.

900
00:56:51,144 --> 00:57:02,380
Scott: Yeah, and if you have if there's anything you want I mean One thing that a lot of other podcasts seem to be more successful at getting than we do even podcasts with lower Listenerships than we have is lots of feedback.

901
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:06,174
Scott: I think that's because we don't read feedback on the show often enough.

902
00:57:06,234 --> 00:57:12,660
Scott: like when we were doing the geek backs We started getting lots of mail and since we stopped doing the eek backs as often we get less mail.

903
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:15,892
Rym: Well, the thing is no one really comments on the show itself.

904
00:57:15,973 --> 00:57:17,860
Rym: they comment on things we've said on the show.

905
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,705
Rym: We never get meta feedback anymore.

906
00:57:19,986 --> 00:57:24,579
Rym: Yeah, like in the first month we'd get complaints like oh the audio sounded bad that day.

907
00:57:24,759 --> 00:57:28,394
Rym: or You guys should stop doing this segment because it's boring.

908
00:57:28,775 --> 00:57:29,960
Rym: No one says anything anymore.

909
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:32,854
Rym: so if you have a complaint about GeekNights lay it on.

910
00:57:33,517 --> 00:57:44,957
Scott: or if you have Suggestions and ideas and all that jazz, you know Show is not like some set-in-stone Show whatever even though it might feel like it because there's not a lot of user listener participation.

911
00:57:45,922 --> 00:57:48,080
Rym: Well, actually there is and it's all in the forums.

912
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:49,263
Rym: It is doesn't like.

913
00:57:49,685 --> 00:57:54,880
Rym: the thing is someone will say something in the forums and then our listeners will respond in the forums.

914
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,188
Rym: Then we'll respond in the forums.

915
00:57:56,490 --> 00:57:58,100
Rym: So none of that ever even hits the show.

916
00:57:58,201 --> 00:58:02,252
Scott: Well, sometimes it might hit the show but we won't let you know in the show that it came from the forum.

917
00:58:02,292 --> 00:58:08,693
Scott: like someone will say something in the forum or Send us an email and then we'll talk about something related to that in the show.

918
00:58:08,713 --> 00:58:11,990
Scott: and unless you're a forum visitor You won't know.

919
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:21,018
Rym: though The forums honestly are make me happier than anything because I wager if the show went away The community in the forums would far outlive it.

920
00:58:21,461 --> 00:58:22,225
Scott: Yeah, probably.

921
00:58:22,546 --> 00:58:25,180
Rym: and he's gotten to the point where the people in the forums are all really cool.

922
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,044
Rym: They all know each other.

923
00:58:26,064 --> 00:58:29,179
Rym: the forums have their own in jokes separate from the show.

924
00:58:30,682 --> 00:58:32,650
Rym: Yeah, all right, I think we're done.

925
00:58:32,691 --> 00:58:34,740
Rym: we actually went long for this bullshit episode.

926
00:58:35,021 --> 00:58:39,244
Scott: Yeah, I know it's kind of hard not to but so GeekNights 222 episodes behind us not yet.

927
00:58:39,284 --> 00:58:51,633
