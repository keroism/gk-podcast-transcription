1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,179
Rym: It's Tuesday May 23rd, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:17,070
Rym: We go back to German games for a bit and review an old standby Alhambra.

3
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,587
Rym: Let's do this.

4
00:00:20,991 --> 00:00:23,281
Scott: So I'm kind of bored at work with no work to do.

5
00:00:23,562 --> 00:00:30,990
Rym: as I've said many many times before I Don't have any work to do yet, but that's because I've been working at my new job a grand total of two days.

6
00:00:31,251 --> 00:00:33,443
Scott: Yeah, but at least you're not bored out of your gourd.

7
00:00:33,463 --> 00:00:34,327
Rym: No it's awesome.

8
00:00:34,387 --> 00:00:38,490
Rym: actually today I went to the data center like the main data center for my company.

9
00:00:39,951 --> 00:00:45,950
Rym: Now I have to say I mean I worked at IBM, and you'd think IBM would have like these crazy awesome data centers.

10
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,961
Scott: No, I think they have mad old shit.

11
00:00:48,644 --> 00:00:59,285
Rym: the data center I was in for my company was probably the most well organized well documented well labeled Perfectly put together well staffed awesome data center.

12
00:00:59,305 --> 00:01:05,321
Rym: I've ever seen in my life Like I think I stumbled on a gold when I took this job.

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,410
Scott: God damn you see you think it's gold, but here's the thing right?

14
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,573
Scott: On the one hand you have IBM a company that's incompetent and all you do is bitch and moan about how they could be doing Things.

15
00:01:14,613 --> 00:01:16,709
Scott: the way the company you work for now is doing them.

16
00:01:17,831 --> 00:01:24,609
Scott: But then there's the other situation where if they were doing things the way that your company does them you have no work to do.

17
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:33,085
Rym: Well actually no I have a lot of work to do because there's the big difference between where I'm working now Which is kind of a normal company in IBM at IBM.

18
00:01:33,346 --> 00:01:34,370
Rym: It was a factory environment.

19
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:38,956
Rym: I wasn't doing the fancy client facing you know Igs blah blah blah.

20
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:45,941
Rym: I was doing the keep the factory running at all cost thing Which meant that my only job was retroactive.

21
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:47,005
Rym: It was never proactive.

22
00:01:47,086 --> 00:01:48,270
Rym: I never made anything better.

23
00:01:48,371 --> 00:01:50,850
Rym: I just fixed things that were broken and maintain the status quo.

24
00:01:51,751 --> 00:01:53,558
Rym: The only goal was keep it working.

25
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,309
Rym: here the goal is always make it better make it better make it better.

26
00:01:56,329 --> 00:02:02,270
Rym: if you think of Something cool make it better mm-hmm, but how can it be better if it's already so great because they're doing more?

27
00:02:02,692 --> 00:02:03,355
Scott: Oh my god.

28
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:11,708
Scott: All right, so anyway being bored at work I my new hobby is to turn on Skype and set it to Skype me mode.

29
00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:15,890
Rym: now It's funny because Emily did that by accident when she first got Skype.

30
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:16,853
Rym: She had it set to.

31
00:02:16,874 --> 00:02:25,360
Rym: you know Skype me instead of just I'm online and I was talking to her over You know and she said these weird people keep trying to talk to me.

32
00:02:26,374 --> 00:02:29,869
Rym: I Think the same people were trying to talk to you.

33
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:38,299
Scott: So first of all if you go on Skype and you search for users that have Skype me mode enabled There are very few like a handful.

34
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:39,223
Scott: you can count them.

35
00:02:39,443 --> 00:02:49,450
Scott: There's so few yet Skype advertises in the bottom right corner that they're like six million people online With less than a hundred of them have Skype me mode enabled.

36
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:59,209
Scott: so If you turn on Skype me mode the number one Category of people that will try to talk to you by the text or voice are Chinese people.

37
00:03:00,758 --> 00:03:06,429
Rym: It's insane Chinese people or Chinese people who only speak Chinese People from China.

38
00:03:07,831 --> 00:03:08,875
Rym: Do they speak English?

39
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:12,850
Scott: I only talked to one of them and they barely spoke English.

40
00:03:13,171 --> 00:03:20,263
Scott: It seems like everyone who messages me even if they're from a foreign country Which most of them are like 90% of the people are from foreign countries.

41
00:03:21,105 --> 00:03:22,329
Scott: They want to speak English.

42
00:03:23,551 --> 00:03:39,490
Scott: So today the two best calls I got one of them wasn't a call it was a text just a chat with some truck driver from Ohio and He Seemed like he didn't like truck driving and he was bored and lonely and I was like, alright, whatever

43
00:03:39,871 --> 00:03:42,280
Rym: Did he want to make the hot online man love with you?

44
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:44,569
Scott: You know, he didn't go that far, but he's like.

45
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:47,938
Scott: You know, he started out with like a or hunk.

46
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:49,162
Scott: I'm like, okay.

47
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,068
Scott: Whoa, and then he was like.

00:03:51,128 --> 00:03:52,533
Scott: so he did I know.

49
00:03:52,634 --> 00:03:58,561
Scott: and then he was like, hey your roommates risk a cuz he he was you know He my link to my flicker was in there.

50
00:03:58,702 --> 00:03:59,990
Rym: Oh god, wait a minute.

51
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:04,810
Rym: So because of you some guy was ogling me, I guess and it was like you about it.

52
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,043
Scott: He was like a roommate who had his shirt off and I'm like whatever.

53
00:04:08,063 --> 00:04:11,417
Scott: and then he's like Where are the pictures of you with your shirt off?

54
00:04:11,477 --> 00:04:16,469
Scott: I'm like, alright, if you're if you want some porn You can just search for it on Google.

55
00:04:17,553 --> 00:04:26,232
Scott: You don't have to Skype me and waste my time Wow, so Then the best one was these two German guys Email.

56
00:04:26,252 --> 00:04:26,653
Scott: they come.

57
00:04:26,693 --> 00:04:30,266
Scott: they conferenced me in so I was talking to two German guys and one guy.

58
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:31,470
Rym: you asked him about board games.

59
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,400
Rym: Yes, did you ask them if you're saying bevagung odoric schlagen Z.

60
00:04:34,501 --> 00:04:35,003
Scott: No, I didn't.

61
00:04:35,063 --> 00:04:35,545
Rym: you should have.

62
00:04:35,565 --> 00:04:40,135
Scott: I already knew the answer to that one but you know They were like they.

63
00:04:40,396 --> 00:04:44,168
Scott: their English is really bad and they knew it and they kept talking to each other in German.

64
00:04:44,188 --> 00:04:44,670
Scott: a whole bunch.

65
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,186
Scott: I was trying to figure out what they were saying, which I did a mediocre job of.

66
00:04:48,507 --> 00:04:52,961
Scott: yeah, and Then they would like ask me a question and I would answer it.

67
00:04:53,262 --> 00:04:58,742
Scott: and then I tried to ask them some questions and I was like Brett spiel.

68
00:04:58,783 --> 00:05:05,628
Scott: well Like they were like, uh, and I was like board game Brett spiel.

Rym: And they were like you weren't like DC Dlerf on Catan?

73
00:05:21,502 --> 00:05:27,993
Scott: no, then they were like do you play World of Warcraft, I'm like no Counter-strike.

74
00:05:28,635 --> 00:05:28,936
Scott: Yes.

75
00:05:28,956 --> 00:05:30,221
Scott: Oh nice.

76
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:32,609
Scott: Not every time I said something they liked they were like nice nice.

77
00:05:33,672 --> 00:05:36,792
Rym: You know, I've heard that like the f1 people seem to say that a lot of them He was.

78
00:05:36,852 --> 00:05:38,303
Rym: I say the word nice a lot.

79
00:05:38,524 --> 00:05:39,330
Scott: Yeah, he was like nice nice.

80

00:05:45,274 --> 00:05:46,498
Scott: and one guy was like I do.

83
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,085
Scott: the other guy was like I don't he does.

84
00:05:48,426 --> 00:05:49,310
Rym: you should have told him to watch.

85
00:05:49,551 --> 00:05:50,295
Rym: Listen to GeekNights.

86
00:05:50,998 --> 00:06:01,319
Scott: I don't think they barely understood me Like we could only use words that were the same in both languages Or it wouldn't work like names of video games.

87
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:04,130
Scott: Like they were like 1.6 or source and I said both.

88
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:09,965
Scott: That was how far it went and then eventually I got bored.

89
00:06:09,985 --> 00:06:12,790
Scott: I just hung up on him, you know You could probably get him to listen anyway.

90
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:18,330
Rym: I mean, I'll note that we seem to be once again more popular with foreigners than we are with Americans.

91
00:06:18,932 --> 00:06:24,355
Rym: Yeah, I mean we thought for all of you we just got and if you're listening It's awesome because I know you're trying hard.

92
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:28,370
Rym: We got a listener in Bangkok who was complaining that he speaks English properly.

93
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,263
Rym: Yeah, he speaks English better than some of you fools in the forums now.

94
00:06:31,504 --> 00:06:34,489
Scott: No offense, but mr Period won't be hurting him anytime soon.

95
00:06:35,131 --> 00:06:41,514
Rym: but he was complaining because apparently Libsyn doesn't allow resume and all this stuff and He's in Bangkok.

96
00:06:41,555 --> 00:06:48,208
Rym: He doesn't have the best internet connection to the US Nope, but he's listening to GeekNights anyway, and he's trying to download it.

97
00:06:49,252 --> 00:06:49,994
Scott: Keep going man.

98
00:06:50,275 --> 00:06:51,419
Rym: Yeah fight the good fight.

99
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,864
Rym: get a better ISP and we'll hook up.

100
00:06:53,226 --> 00:06:56,314
Scott: Yeah, we'll go visit Bangkok We had to get.

101
00:06:56,615 --> 00:07:03,147
Scott: we're gonna have to start doing the Akamai to get people so everyone in the whole world can listen All right.

102
00:07:05,232 --> 00:07:08,384
Scott: So some news is some news is it's video game day, right?

103
00:07:08,685 --> 00:07:09,086
Scott: Well, it's a day.

104
00:07:11,573 --> 00:07:14,809
Scott: It's some DS news in Europe, I think It's your news.

105
00:07:16,575 --> 00:07:28,290
Rym: So apparently the DS light is gonna come out here in June, I think yeah I'm really I want one, but I shouldn't waste the money especially because I'm not sure when my first paycheck's coming, but I want one.

106
00:07:28,691 --> 00:07:30,680
Scott: Oh, yeah, when are you getting paid real soon?

107
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,423
Rym: It's bi-weekly.

108
00:07:31,463 --> 00:07:33,448
Rym: So at most it'll be three weeks All right.

109
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,961
Scott: So I don't want you to be without money for too long.

110
00:07:35,981 --> 00:07:39,641
Rym: if I'm without money for too long you pay rent once and then I pay you back when I get my giant check.

111
00:07:39,762 --> 00:07:43,240
Rym: Yeah, so Plus I'm getting a check from IBM Thursday.

112
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,224
Scott: No, that's good.

113
00:07:44,284 --> 00:07:45,489
Rym: I might get one next Thursday, too.

114
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:46,413
Rym: Ooh, all right.

115
00:07:46,473 --> 00:07:56,392
Scott: So Europe apparently is not only getting the DS light, you know, I think in July I didn't look but they're also getting a black DS light Huh?

116
00:07:56,472 --> 00:07:58,177
Scott: Why does Europe get the black DS light?

117
00:07:58,197 --> 00:07:58,538
Scott: How come we?

118
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,082
Rym: don't my best guess?

119
00:08:00,162 --> 00:08:03,090
Rym: This is accomplices rims speculation time.

120
00:08:03,893 --> 00:08:15,870
Rym: I think that they've realized that the DS and Nintendo in general doesn't do so well in Europe But a lot of things don't do so well in Europe mainly because Europe is kind of the last place finish of video gaming.

121
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:20,187
Scott: It seems like anywhere that's not Japan or the US is all PC gaming action.

122
00:08:20,228 --> 00:08:20,589
Scott: Mostly.

123
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:23,751
Rym: Yeah Well, I mean look at the PlayStation 3 it's gonna be the equivalent of over $800 in Europe.

124
00:08:23,772 --> 00:08:28,878
Rym: Yeah, I mean god damn All the games come there late.

125
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:31,590
Rym: all the movies from the West and from Japan get there late.

126
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,499
Rym: They really get the stick end of the stick.

127
00:08:34,162 --> 00:08:35,929
Scott: Europe should make more of its own stuff.

128
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:36,251
Scott: You know what?

129
00:08:36,272 --> 00:08:37,015
Scott: I think it is though.

130
00:08:37,034 --> 00:08:40,409
Scott: I think the problem is they get our stuff late and we get their stuff never.

131
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,250
Rym: Yeah, I mean many Americans aren't interest interested in anything foreign.

132
00:08:45,913 --> 00:08:48,785
Rym: I know some punk kids where if you told them anime was Japanese.

133
00:08:48,825 --> 00:08:49,609
Rym: They'd probably freak out.

134
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:53,854
Scott: Guess what?

135
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:57,520
Scott: All your video games are Japanese - yeah Possibly Korean.

136
00:08:58,087 --> 00:09:06,624
Rym: Yep But I could see this is Nintendo trying to do like a a little olive branch to Europe saying hey Here's something just for you.

137
00:09:07,775 --> 00:09:12,695
Scott: Yeah, they've also got this Weird European DS commercial.

138
00:09:12,715 --> 00:09:13,397
Scott: you can go watch.

139
00:09:13,437 --> 00:09:15,904
Scott: that looks like a clothing fashion commercial.

140
00:09:16,225 --> 00:09:17,930
Scott: only the people aren't wearing as many clothes.

141
00:09:18,372 --> 00:09:22,030
Rym: See it could also be part of the fact that they you know, you have to market to Europe differently.

142
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:25,050
Rym: I mean they know how to market to the US and they know how to market to Japan.

143
00:09:25,493 --> 00:09:28,089
Rym: I mean look at the commercials here versus Japan and how different they are.

144
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:32,662
Scott: Yeah, but it's weird that they're actually trying in Europe.

145
00:09:32,722 --> 00:09:33,184
Rym: You know what?

146
00:09:33,304 --> 00:09:37,238
Rym: No other video game company tries So well, no console video game company.

147
00:09:37,258 --> 00:09:43,049
Rym: So in Nintendo's trying to you know, blue water strat blue ocean They're trying to open up to as many people as possible.

148
00:09:43,632 --> 00:09:54,489
Rym: If they even nothing else all the Americans in the Japanese will try to get this black DS Early and then the sales numbers will look like they were sold from Europe and then antenna will take the lead over there to.

149
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:56,593
Rym: yeah You know also

150
00:09:56,633 --> 00:10:09,450
Scott: they're gonna put out a new Nintendo's in Europe with like a new dog and then it's sort of like the best hits where they took the most popular dogs from all the existing ones and Added like a Dalmatian and they put it out in Europe.

151
00:10:09,711 --> 00:10:10,534
Scott: They're gonna do that too.

152
00:10:10,855 --> 00:10:15,070
Rym: I think this is the beginning of a push by Nintendo to penetrate the European market.

153
00:10:15,231 --> 00:10:18,044
Rym: We'll see if it works and I did not mean any sexual metaphor there.

154
00:10:18,064 --> 00:10:26,290
Rym: I Don't know if it's gonna work You know, I mean look how they're doing now, I mean brain age and all these games for non gamers.

155
00:10:27,091 --> 00:10:30,590
Rym: I think those are the games they're really gonna push in Europe to try to make the DS sell more.

156
00:10:30,691 --> 00:10:32,990
Scott: Yeah, but I don't think people in Europe care about games at all.

157
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,983
Scott: They have better things to do because they're in fucking Europe where there are things to do.

158
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:38,321
Rym: Yeah, you know, they can live their lives They don't have to work.

159
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:40,781
Rym: For all of you European listeners.

160
00:10:40,842 --> 00:10:46,590
Rym: I'll just let you know that Americans I don't think you realize how little vacation time and free time we get in this country.

161
00:10:46,951 --> 00:10:57,104
Rym: None I get a month as in four or twenty thirty days of vacation a year And that's really kind of crazy that I get that much right now.

162
00:10:57,204 --> 00:10:58,870
Scott: I get ten days at IBM.

163
00:10:59,051 --> 00:11:00,359
Scott: I got five next year.

164
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:01,948
Scott: I'll have fifteen days five.

165
00:11:03,651 --> 00:11:08,550
Rym: Imagine if you got five days off a year, you know plus weekends and a few holidays.

166
00:11:09,212 --> 00:11:10,376
Rym: Yeah, plus the holidays.

167
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:15,029
Rym: we get off for the crap ones when everyone gets them off and you can't go anywhere because everyone's trying to go somewhere.

168
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:18,634
Rym: Yeah, it's hard we.

169
00:11:18,674 --> 00:11:20,281
Rym: it's hard for us to go on trips like.

170
00:11:20,321 --> 00:11:23,253
Rym: it's hard for us to say let's pop off to Europe and Backpack for a month.

171
00:11:23,654 --> 00:11:28,190
Scott: Yeah, but if you're in Europe, you can just take trains to the other countries to see all the castles and shit.

172
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:29,481
Scott: We can't see castles.

173
00:11:29,501 --> 00:11:31,673
Scott: No, there's no nice Over here.

174
00:11:31,693 --> 00:11:33,018
Scott: There is nothing nice here.

175
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:33,922
Rym: We've got a castle.

176
00:11:33,962 --> 00:11:34,645
Rym: We've got banner.

177
00:11:34,685 --> 00:11:35,810
Scott: It's a shit castle.

178
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:39,841
Scott: It's not a real medieval castle to shit post 1700 castle.

179
00:11:39,981 --> 00:11:40,724
Scott: Yeah 1800 castle.

180
00:11:40,744 --> 00:11:41,285
Scott: That sucks.

181
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,720
Scott: I want to see some 1200 castle to its credit.

182
00:11:45,841 --> 00:11:48,250
Scott: It's an 800 castle to bannerman castles credit.

183
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:54,190
Rym: It did explode and then burn down and now it is covered in poison ivy great and possibly wild animals.

184
00:11:54,692 --> 00:11:58,129
Scott: I want to go see the German castles and the Welsh castles.

185
00:11:59,231 --> 00:12:03,990
Rym: You know by night this time next year we have more money because we've kind of spent a lot of money lately.

186
00:12:04,472 --> 00:12:06,742
Rym: We should just go to Europe and meet all our listeners over there.

187
00:12:07,023 --> 00:12:11,469
Scott: Yeah, so there won't be Any podcast for like two weeks.

188
00:12:12,351 --> 00:12:14,468
Scott: They'll be one really long line.

189
00:12:15,812 --> 00:12:18,070
Scott: It's like here's what Rimmins got recorded while in Europe.

190
00:12:18,653 --> 00:12:19,599
Rym: Actually, I got a better idea.

191
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:24,110
Rym: if things get bad enough in this country Can we stay with one of you guys out there in the free world?

192
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,238
Scott: Maybe I don't think it's that free over there.

193
00:12:27,258 --> 00:12:28,803
Scott: It's just an illusion.

194
00:12:28,823 --> 00:12:30,750
Rym: Yeah, we could always go to Canada.

195
00:12:31,392 --> 00:12:32,635
Scott: Yeah, it's so much better.

196
00:12:32,655 --> 00:12:34,801
Rym: Yeah, it kind of is except for the weather.

197
00:12:35,262 --> 00:12:35,904
Scott: Yeah, great.

198
00:12:36,285 --> 00:12:37,649
Scott: Why can't Canada be on the bottom?

199
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:40,079
Rym: Yeah Because then it would be Mexico.

200
00:12:40,099 --> 00:12:41,407
Scott: Let's go to Mexico then.

201
00:12:41,568 --> 00:12:44,803
Rym: All right Yeah, we'd probably make a lot of money in Mexico's IT guys.

202
00:12:44,863 --> 00:12:48,497
Scott: We got to find some internets in Mexico The there's internet and learn some Spanish is.

203
00:12:49,621 --> 00:12:52,110
Rym: I know French a little I know Spanish.

204
00:12:52,332 --> 00:12:57,563
Scott: I can read a Spanish newspaper kinda Yeah, but I can't speak it a lot because I don't like.

205
00:12:57,603 --> 00:13:03,787
Scott: if I see a word I can figure out what it means But I can't just come up with the word in my brain to say it.

206
00:13:03,927 --> 00:13:08,070
Rym: Yeah Well, I'm a further step removed because I can kind of read a French newspaper.

207
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:10,962
Rym: So then a Spanish newspaper is I can kind of read.

208
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:12,850
Rym: I get almost nothing out of it.

209
00:13:13,031 --> 00:13:20,466
Rym: So you go to Canada and I'll go to Mexico All right, and then and then we'll wait for them to build that highway over the u.s.

210
00:13:20,506 --> 00:13:21,028
Rym: Between the two.

211
00:13:21,189 --> 00:13:22,673
Rym: good idea All right.

212
00:13:22,874 --> 00:13:25,365
Rym: I got a non video game news because there's no other video game news.

213
00:13:25,426 --> 00:13:26,290
Rym: I care about today.

214
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:35,090
Rym: now Microsoft supposedly is going to take administrator rights away from most of their employees on their computers.

215
00:13:35,711 --> 00:13:39,220
Scott: Why would employees have administrator rights if they're not the network administrators?

216
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:44,532
Rym: the vast majority of people who use Windows run it as administrator Always.

217
00:13:44,994 --> 00:13:46,419
Rym: you may not be called administrator.

218
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:49,170
Rym: You might be called something else, but you're probably in the administrator group.

219
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:53,170
Scott: You're basically root on your computer and that's bad for a zillion reasons.

220
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:59,030
Scott: But because Windows sucks you need to do it that way or else it's incredibly frustrating and that's why Windows sucks.

221
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,063
Rym: Yeah, well, it's not just Microsoft's fault.

222
00:14:01,103 --> 00:14:02,129
Rym: It's kind of complicated.

223
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:08,729
Rym: Yeah, that's Microsoft made because Windows 3 1 and earlier had really no permission model at all.

224
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:22,050
Rym: No You just you had a computer with NT early NT like NT 3 and such and even like early windows like Windows 95 You could futz with it to make a kind of log in as different users.

225
00:14:22,351 --> 00:14:26,104
Scott: Windows her work groups had it in the wussiest possible way.

226
00:14:26,244 --> 00:14:30,518
Rym: Yeah back with wins and all that Yeah, but even then it barely work barely worked.

227
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:33,789
Scott: Remember when Windows 95 had that inbox on the desktop.

228
00:14:33,869 --> 00:14:36,863
Scott: Yeah Yeah, no one had an email system where that would work.

229
00:14:37,064 --> 00:14:45,390
Rym: Yeah, I know to this day But When they as they added they started adding security stuff and permission stuff kind of like what?

230
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:48,038
Rym: Unix and Linux have only kinda.

231
00:14:48,499 --> 00:14:51,830
Rym: it's actually fairly robust and well done in terms of the concept.

232
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:58,150
Rym: It's just really counterintuitive and annoying and not easy or trivial to use at all.

233
00:14:58,511 --> 00:15:04,110
Rym: Like I it's not easy if you don't know about computers to deal with Linux file permissions the first few times.

234
00:15:04,814 --> 00:15:07,369
Rym: It's a thousand times harder to deal with the windows ones.

235
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,892
Scott: Well, that's because you know They came over.

236
00:15:08,912 --> 00:15:15,076
Scott: the Unix file permissions is lean years ago and there was nothing wrong with them and they haven't changed And they're not complicated.

237
00:15:15,096 --> 00:15:16,421
Rym: They're well documented too.

238
00:15:16,702 --> 00:15:18,550
Scott: Yeah, it's just a number.

239
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:19,633
Rym: Windows.

240
00:15:19,694 --> 00:15:26,719
Rym: don't don't even get me started on Windows file permissions File permissions, what are the versions for other things?

241
00:15:27,281 --> 00:15:33,830
Rym: Yeah, I have some stories about file permissions But they had the security model and it's gotten more and more robust over the years.

242
00:15:34,271 --> 00:15:55,005
Rym: but they've tried to make windows so that you don't have to run as administrator anymore or as root anymore, basically and One of the ways they've did this is they made a thing called run as where you can be a normal user But you can right-click on a program and say run this as administrator Because many programs need the access that administrator has usually

243
00:15:55,045 --> 00:15:56,430
Scott: when you're trying to install software.

244
00:15:57,072 --> 00:15:59,822
Rym: Well, yeah, but there's a lot of software that was won't run at all.

245
00:15:59,902 --> 00:16:00,825
Rym: Unless you're administrator.

246
00:16:00,865 --> 00:16:01,447
Scott: Well, it's terrible.

247
00:16:01,467 --> 00:16:02,230
Scott: That's really bad.

248
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:06,142
Scott: Yeah, mostly I've seen stuff that won't install properly unless you're administrator.

249
00:16:06,243 --> 00:16:12,460
Rym: Yeah, but lots of proprietary applications some office II things Earlier versions of narrow.

250
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,070
Rym: you had to be administrator to burn.

251
00:16:14,798 --> 00:16:21,858
Rym: Wow, yeah all sorts of stuff and One Microsoft permissions are kind of wonky.

252
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:25,067
Rym: So this run as thing doesn't work like at all.

253
00:16:25,448 --> 00:16:26,350
Rym: It's really useless.

254
00:16:26,511 --> 00:16:32,289
Rym: You still have to log in as administrator and you might as well just stay administrator because otherwise half the things you have won't work.

255
00:16:32,851 --> 00:16:46,445
Rym: Yeah to people who write programs for Windows Often don't understand how the permissions work or don't understand how to you know, write code Selena writing a program that needs administrator access to work for no other reason than that.

256
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:47,789
Rym: They're stupid and they don't know any better.

257
00:16:49,011 --> 00:16:50,828
Rym: Microsoft yells at him They don't know or care.

258
00:16:51,272 --> 00:17:02,417
Rym: But then Microsoft's thing is almost as broken and in the end You have to be administrator all the time or your Windows computer is almost useless and that leaves it Incredibly open to all sorts of security problems.

259
00:17:02,437 --> 00:17:05,724
Scott: because if anyone gets control of your computer run out there.

260
00:17:05,744 --> 00:17:12,006
Scott: the administrator and they have complete control Is if you were running as some other account and they got control of your computer.

261
00:17:12,246 --> 00:17:13,210
Scott: they couldn't do that much.

262
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:15,638
Rym: Yeah, the worst they could do is ruin your user space.

263
00:17:16,342 --> 00:17:18,490
Scott: Oh, they deleted my my documents folder.

264
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:22,502
Rym: Yeah, but if your user space is the administrator space then they're gonna raise your hard drive.

265
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:24,047
Rym: This is base includes everything.

266
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,150
Rym: Yeah every day.

267
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:32,650
Scott: See now the real reason for this that I see design wise is that in Linux ever in Unix and any Nix?

268
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,569
Scott: Everything is a file.

269
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,829
Scott: Absolutely, everything is a file.

270
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:46,919
Scott: So you only need to set a permission structure that deals with files and that can deal with everything devices Users everything because it's all files.

271
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,906
Scott: See all you need is to control the files and Windows.

272
00:17:50,307 --> 00:17:51,410
Scott: It's not just the files.

273
00:17:51,631 --> 00:18:00,249
Scott: There's all sorts of other things that aren't files and that makes it so that your permission structure has to be incredibly Complicated to deal with all sorts of different things

274
00:18:01,353 --> 00:18:08,905
Rym: Which also wouldn't be that bad Except that they don't document a lot of it because it's their proprietary secret internal closed source code

275
00:18:09,085 --> 00:18:11,931
Scott: and the implementation is really Crappy

276
00:18:12,493 --> 00:18:14,641
Rym: and kind of arbitrary kind of spotty.

277
00:18:14,782 --> 00:18:19,928
Scott: different things work in different ways for no reason Yeah, and the active directory and the domains don't help.

278
00:18:20,935 --> 00:18:23,770
Rym: Yeah, they work really well if you know what you're doing But if you know what you're doing.

279
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:27,985
Scott: You probably hate them and if you try to do anything out of the ordinary it fucks up.

280
00:18:28,126 --> 00:18:29,210
Scott: and the worst is this is a?

281
00:18:29,491 --> 00:18:37,922
Scott: Problem I think my company has is that you know you have let's say you set up an active directory and a bunch of Windows 2000 clients by the book right.

282
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,410
Scott: it's perfect glorious.

283
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:41,522
Scott: Then you start to add something.

284
00:18:41,603 --> 00:18:44,278
Scott: well you add Let's say a printer a network printer.

285
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:46,368
Scott: you add it by the book and everything's still cool.

286
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:59,561
Scott: Then add maybe a file server still cool, then you go out and you get this proprietary device that your company needs say a Fancy machine and the machine needs to get on your active directory.

287
00:18:59,601 --> 00:19:03,332
Scott: well now you need to modify your active directory somehow to accommodate This machine.

288
00:19:03,673 --> 00:19:05,620
Scott: then you get another proprietary software.

289
00:19:05,861 --> 00:19:08,329
Scott: We have to modify your active directory to accommodate that.

290
00:19:08,489 --> 00:19:08,690
Scott: yeah.

291
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,301
Scott: Then you start getting conflicts between the different accommodations.

292
00:19:11,662 --> 00:19:13,088
Scott: now other things stop working.

293
00:19:13,209 --> 00:19:16,399
Rym: so you got User needs Oracle database.

294
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,250
Rym: I defy you to install Oracle database properly without being administrator.

295
00:19:20,573 --> 00:19:22,468
Rym: Yeah, yeah, or even use it.

296
00:19:23,133 --> 00:19:35,709
Scott: That's the thing is if it was written properly then I would as if I was a sales working at a company right and I had a User account that was not administrator, and I had a properly written Oracle database.

297
00:19:35,749 --> 00:19:37,574
Scott: as soon It doesn't exist, but let's say it did.

298
00:19:38,236 --> 00:19:46,009
Scott: I should be able to install it into my my documents folder into my user space With no one else on the computer having access to it.

299
00:19:46,411 --> 00:19:47,899
Scott: That's what you're allowed to do in Unix.

300
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,170
Scott: you can install any software you want to your home folder.

301
00:19:50,491 --> 00:19:56,163
Scott: No one can stop you unless they decide that they don't want to let you write to your own home folder But that you know.

302
00:19:56,183 --> 00:19:59,800
Scott: you get the idea You can do anything you want in your little box.

303
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:05,939
Rym: now despite this most corporations still don't give their users They're run-of-the-mill users administrative access you shouldn't?

304
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,989
Rym: I have administrative access to my computer because I know what I'm doing.

305
00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:09,752
Scott: yeah They should.

306
00:20:10,074 --> 00:20:13,854
Scott: you can give them administrative access to the local machine But you should not not.

307
00:20:13,894 --> 00:20:17,466
Rym: even then most companies most companies give you nothing to your local machine.

308
00:20:17,827 --> 00:20:20,661
Scott: Yeah, yeah Well it really depends a lot of the time.

309
00:20:20,722 --> 00:20:21,446
Scott: I mean remember.

310
00:20:21,466 --> 00:20:25,147
Rym: We're tech workers We see it from the entirely different side, and they usually accommodate us.

311
00:20:25,449 --> 00:20:26,559
Scott: well Yeah, but you know that's.

312
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,749
Scott: that's besides the point now.

313
00:20:28,092 --> 00:20:40,709
Rym: I think this whole you know the actual news here is great because now Microsoft and Microsoft employees are gonna have to deal with all the brokenness of the windows Permission scheme which might drive them to try and fix it.

314
00:20:42,211 --> 00:20:42,873
Scott: It's if they got it.

315
00:20:42,913 --> 00:20:44,338
Scott: if they don't fix this in Vista.

316
00:20:44,539 --> 00:20:45,181
Scott: It's the end.

317
00:20:45,843 --> 00:20:47,047
Rym: It's the end for Vista anyway.

318
00:20:47,107 --> 00:20:47,870
Rym: I'm can I'm done?

319
00:20:48,131 --> 00:20:49,997
Scott: Yeah, I know, but it's the super end.

320
00:20:50,017 --> 00:20:52,406
Rym: I mean corporations aren't even gonna go to Vista.

321
00:20:52,687 --> 00:20:53,550
Scott: No no one is.

322
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,881
Rym: They're probably gonna stay on XP.

323
00:20:54,901 --> 00:20:55,910
Rym: they might even hire people.

324
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:56,940
Scott: You know who's going to Vista.

325
00:20:57,021 --> 00:21:05,610
Scott: the crazy Too much money buy a new computer every week from Alienware gamers because it's gonna provide some fancy words.

326
00:21:06,417 --> 00:21:13,046
Scott: You know what I'll keep playing Half-life 1 & 2 and the yuppies who you know gotta have all fancy gadgets that they don't use.

327
00:21:13,126 --> 00:21:14,410
Rym: you know we're kind of yuppies.

328
00:21:15,591 --> 00:21:17,741
Scott: We're not yuppie like those guys yeah, but we're young.

329
00:21:17,782 --> 00:21:19,490
Rym: we're upwardly mobile for professionals.

330
00:21:20,854 --> 00:21:25,860
Scott: Yeah, so so But we're not like those guys who are just like buying boats and shit.

331
00:21:26,503 --> 00:21:28,730
Rym: Yeah, well that's because we're not upper middle class.

332
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,915
Rym: We're just middle class.

333
00:21:29,935 --> 00:21:34,698
Rym: mm-hmm if you combine us, but we're there's only if we combine our salaries But there's just one of us.

334
00:21:34,738 --> 00:21:35,808
Rym: then yeah, we're upper middle class.

335
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:46,216
Rym: Yeah, yeah anyway Microsoft is probably gonna have some trouble with this new policy, and I can't wait for the hilarity Microsoft employees will be pissed.

336
00:21:46,758 --> 00:21:47,220
Rym: I'm waiting.

337
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:47,842
Scott: you know what though?

338
00:21:47,862 --> 00:21:49,910
Scott: what it's gonna happen is the Microsoft employees.

339
00:21:50,332 --> 00:21:53,007
Scott: They know how to hack windows because they get all the reports.

340
00:21:53,067 --> 00:22:03,210
Scott: if he has the new Vulnerability and then they're just gonna start hacking their own machines it might And they're not gonna want to fix those vulnerabilities because then their own hacks won't work anymore, and it'll be funny.

341
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,047
Rym: This is gonna be great all right.

342
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:13,336
Rym: My thing of the day is pretty old.

343
00:22:13,356 --> 00:22:14,663
Rym: in fact It's real old.

344
00:22:14,703 --> 00:22:18,942
Rym: we saw it way back at RIT in like 2003 2004.

345
00:22:18,942 --> 00:22:22,239
Scott: So this is like a thing of the day of ancient times.

346
00:22:22,662 --> 00:22:23,707
Rym: It's more than I realized.

347
00:22:23,768 --> 00:22:24,290
Rym: it's so old.

348
00:22:24,331 --> 00:22:30,864
Rym: it was before we started doing GeekNights And I don't know how many of you have seen it because it's kind of faded from The limelight.

349
00:22:31,065 --> 00:22:35,779
Scott: should we start doing archaeological things of the day we could do a thing of the day Dinosaurs.

350
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,791
Scott: Yeah, right all right.

351
00:22:39,374 --> 00:22:41,060
Rym: This is a series of movies.

352
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,107
Rym: I don't think it'll ever be completed, but there's four of them.

353
00:22:43,468 --> 00:22:46,919
Rym: the second one is in my opinion by far the greatest of them.

354
00:22:48,103 --> 00:23:01,980
Rym: They are Mario the story done in a super overdramatic Really really dark and serious way, but with the original sprites Like the Mario one and doki-doki panic sprites.

355
00:23:02,762 --> 00:23:08,713
Rym: The only doki-doki panic sprites are the toads which they needed to use because there was no sideways facing toad in Mario 1.

356
00:23:08,713 --> 00:23:12,230
Scott: No There was only the front facing toad at the end of the level.

357
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,717
Scott: who said the princess is another castle bitch?

358
00:23:14,877 --> 00:23:15,700
Rym: in the very least.

359
00:23:16,341 --> 00:23:18,146
Rym: Watch the second of these videos.

360
00:23:18,387 --> 00:23:21,034
Rym: the first one first works, but the second video is the best one.

361
00:23:21,175 --> 00:23:27,965
Scott: It's really really cool Yep, and if you already know as you've seen is already Yeah, it did show.

362
00:23:28,025 --> 00:23:32,640
Rym: I mean it shows the army of Koopa attacking the Mushroom Kingdom in an awesome way.

363
00:23:33,202 --> 00:23:36,472
Rym: It feels very much like the second Lord of the Rings movie hmm.

364
00:23:37,175 --> 00:23:37,395
Scott: Yeah.

365
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:41,259
Scott: Yeah with the epicness Yeah, maybe giant army all right.

366
00:23:42,243 --> 00:23:48,639
Scott: so everyone knows about YouTube and We have a lot of things of the day that are specific videos from YouTube and/or Google video.

367
00:23:49,463 --> 00:23:53,280
Scott: But today I found a crazy thing on YouTube.

368
00:23:53,721 --> 00:24:04,059
Scott: Apparently on YouTube you can make playlists of videos and Some user on YouTube named dig user as in dig.

369
00:24:04,099 --> 00:24:14,677
Scott: the website Has created a bunch of playlists and these playlists consist of numerous complete episodes of popular cartoon shows.

370
00:24:15,803 --> 00:24:22,881
Scott: And we got some item maniacs Aquitaine Batman whoo Beavis the butthead Bobby's world

371
00:24:23,404 --> 00:24:24,430
Rym: like Bobby's world

372
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:28,943
Scott: I'm not gonna read them all but we got some inspector gadgets Voltron

373
00:24:29,003 --> 00:24:30,327
Rym: captain and the game master

374
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:37,728
Scott: captain and Mario Super Show pink in the brain muppet babies x-men Mickey Mouse real ghostbusters etc.

Scott: etc.

377
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:42,330
Scott: It's a there's a lot of good stuff, and you can watch it all on YouTube.

378
00:24:42,671 --> 00:24:44,318
Scott: Hurry up and watch it before they take it down.

379
00:24:44,378 --> 00:24:45,001
Scott: Oh my god.

380
00:24:45,041 --> 00:24:47,029
Rym: Yeah, I know what I'm doing tonight.

381
00:24:47,561 --> 00:24:52,802
Scott: Yeah Yeah, we got to get one of those Firefox extensions and lets us download videos from YouTube.

382
00:24:53,163 --> 00:24:54,407
Rym: Yeah, of course.

383
00:24:54,427 --> 00:24:57,109
Scott: It is pretty slow But what it's worth it.

384
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:02,485
Scott: Yeah, I see to watch some of these old shows that aren't on DVD or won't be on DVD.

385
00:25:02,505 --> 00:25:06,938
Rym: the Super Mario Brothers show is Yeah, it's actually in the Netflix queue.

386
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,430
Scott: I think it's actually in this giant box set you can get for like 20 bucks.

387
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:15,026
Scott: Yeah, like eight discs all of the Mario Super Show 20 bucks 30 bucks.

388
00:25:15,086 --> 00:25:16,090
Scott: Maybe I don't remember.

389
00:25:17,571 --> 00:25:22,790
Rym: So we haven't talked about board games in a while mostly because there's been you know e3 and all this video game news lately.

390
00:25:23,171 --> 00:25:29,830
Scott: Yep, and recently the let's look at Mark Johnson who has the cool board games to go podcast.

391
00:25:30,191 --> 00:25:39,610
Scott: He meant she found discovered us and mentioned us in his podcast and so a lot of his listeners came over So we will entertain them with some board game talk that they have been no doubt awaiting.

392
00:25:40,651 --> 00:25:43,040
Rym: Yeah, now one of our favorite game.

393
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,490
Rym: I mean we have we have a huge pile of games.

394
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:48,800
Rym: We have more games than most people we know just piled up.

395
00:25:49,021 --> 00:25:52,472
Scott: Yeah, of course compared to super board game guys We got nothing.

396
00:25:52,914 --> 00:25:55,204
Rym: Well, partly because we don't really if a game sucks.

397
00:25:55,224 --> 00:25:56,569
Rym: We just get rid of it or we don't buy it.

398
00:25:57,073 --> 00:25:59,569
Rym: Yeah, I mean the only bad game we really have is Hellas.

399
00:26:01,251 --> 00:26:01,914
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

400
00:26:02,496 --> 00:26:04,323
Scott: Yep, and Hellas is really small.

401
00:26:04,484 --> 00:26:08,822
Rym: Yeah, physically speaking I don't really like Ticket to Ride Europe, but it wasn't that bad.

402
00:26:08,963 --> 00:26:09,846
Rym: Maybe I'll sell it someday.

403
00:26:09,867 --> 00:26:10,550
Scott: I like it.

404
00:26:11,411 --> 00:26:12,354
Rym: I don't like it.

405
00:26:12,374 --> 00:26:13,558
Scott: All right, whatever.

406
00:26:13,819 --> 00:26:15,224
Rym: I like railroad tycoon a lot more.

407
00:26:15,565 --> 00:26:17,050
Scott: Yeah, it's a different kind of game though.

408
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,826
Rym: But anyway, we realized that a lot of these games are so good.

409
00:26:20,926 --> 00:26:21,730
Rym: We play them so often.

410
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,249
Rym: We never even thought to really talk about him on the show.

411
00:26:24,451 --> 00:26:25,558
Scott: I thought to talk about him.

412
00:26:25,578 --> 00:26:31,828
Scott: the problem is he kept talking about the new games We were acquiring and we never went into the backlog of games that we've had forever.

413
00:26:31,848 --> 00:26:35,010
Rym: Yep I mean, we haven't really talked about Puerto Rico Tigers and Euphrates.

414
00:26:36,172 --> 00:26:40,290
Scott: No, none of those games that we've had for years that we played a zillion times.

415
00:26:40,872 --> 00:26:46,508
Rym: So we just we decided one game that I actually didn't play it this weekend, but all the rest of these fools did Alhambra.

416
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:57,746
Scott: Alhambra is a game that we played a whole bunch and we got it and then we stopped playing it just because we didn't have An opportunity even though we tried to play a bunch of times and then finally this weekend.

417
00:26:57,826 --> 00:26:59,050
Scott: We finally got a game out.

418
00:26:59,532 --> 00:27:03,150
Rym: It's a real handy game because the man it's two to six players.

419
00:27:03,812 --> 00:27:07,909
Scott: Yeah, the only thing with more players than that is something like Citadel.

420
00:27:07,929 --> 00:27:08,170
Rym: Citadel's.

421
00:27:10,771 --> 00:27:14,080
Scott: I think Scotland Yard is also two to six, right?

422
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,424
Scott: I think so three to six.

423
00:27:15,965 --> 00:27:17,730
Scott: Yeah, so six players is pretty good.

424
00:27:18,832 --> 00:27:28,054
Rym: Of course, I don't recommend the two-player of Alhambra because it It added it gave us an inside joke Matt Yeah.

425
00:27:28,335 --> 00:27:28,516
Scott: All right.

426
00:27:28,537 --> 00:27:29,221
Scott: Let's start with that.

427
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:35,083
Scott: Alhambra is a Yeah, Alhambra is a game where it's better to have more players.

428
00:27:35,364 --> 00:27:37,430
Scott: six players is best two players is worst.

429
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:46,744
Scott: But if you play with two players, the way it works is you're actually playing a three-player game But the third player is an imaginary player.

430
00:27:46,804 --> 00:27:50,900
Rym: He's just some guy named Matt Yeah, the book actually names him as Matt.

431
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,930
Scott: Yes, and Matt has a set.

432
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:58,010
Scott: It's sort of like black check where the dealer just follows some rules and doesn't actually play.

433
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,210
Scott: Matt is like the dealer in black check.

434
00:28:00,431 --> 00:28:04,525
Scott: He just follows the rules of Matt and makes the decisions that Matt makes.

435
00:28:04,545 --> 00:28:05,388
Rym: I don't think it really.

436
00:28:05,428 --> 00:28:06,070
Rym: it makes many.

437
00:28:06,331 --> 00:28:07,898
Rym: I think he just starts with a bunch of tiles.

438
00:28:08,058 --> 00:28:10,107
Scott: Yeah, he just starts with a bunch of tiles sits there.

439
00:28:10,127 --> 00:28:21,324
Rym: Yep He generally just makes the game crappy to play with Matt Mostly because I have to dig through the tile deck pull out X number of tiles do all this other stuff to the game before I can play it.

440
00:28:22,097 --> 00:28:26,824
Scott: yeah, so Basically you don't want even though Alhambra says two to six.

441
00:28:26,884 --> 00:28:28,490
Scott: don't mistake it for a two-player game.

442
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:38,097
Scott: The two-player game is a hack and it's not fun more unless you're in an emergency and you really have this insane Raging urge to play Alhambra.

443
00:28:38,739 --> 00:28:39,761
Rym: We've had that before.

444
00:28:39,982 --> 00:28:42,750
Scott: so yeah, we did play it with Matt once or twice.

445
00:28:43,133 --> 00:28:43,860
Rym: Yeah, it was terrible.

446
00:28:44,204 --> 00:28:44,850
Scott: Very terrible.

447
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:50,330
Rym: All right, Alhambra is a very in terms of what you need to do and know an incredibly simple game.

448
00:28:51,332 --> 00:28:51,613
Rym: It has.

449
00:28:51,653 --> 00:28:52,195
Rym: there's money.

450
00:28:52,255 --> 00:28:56,405
Rym: there are four colors of money orange blue green and yellow.

451
00:28:56,446 --> 00:29:00,714
Rym: Yeah, they're like dinars ducats Somethings and somethings.

452
00:29:01,035 --> 00:29:01,656
Rym: I don't remember.

453
00:29:01,797 --> 00:29:04,203
Scott: I heard it doesn't matter four colors of money.

454
00:29:04,464 --> 00:29:05,005
Rym: and there's what?

455
00:29:05,046 --> 00:29:06,630
Rym: five or six colors of tiles.

456
00:29:07,033 --> 00:29:09,594
Scott: I think the six and You.

457
00:29:09,936 --> 00:29:18,430
Rym: the tiles are square and they have a color on them They have a price on them and they have one two, three four or zero wall segments on them.

458
00:29:18,571 --> 00:29:19,655
Scott: They have zero one.

459
00:29:19,776 --> 00:29:21,986
Scott: Oh, yeah, they can't have four walls.

460
00:29:22,046 --> 00:29:27,429
Scott: No, they can't Have zero one two or three walls on them.

461
00:29:28,393 --> 00:29:34,898
Rym: and all you do on your turn is you either take some money from a money pool or Buy a piece and put it in your Alhambra.

462
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:42,930
Scott: Now the gimmick of this game is that You don't have money like monopoly where you make change all over the place.

463
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,402
Scott: You have cards with numbers and colors on them.

464
00:29:45,523 --> 00:29:46,889
Rym: You don't make change.

465
00:29:47,211 --> 00:29:48,357
Scott: So, let's say the only.

466
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:50,610
Scott: let's say I have a card that says nine orange.

467
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:56,167
Scott: It's a has a number nine and it's orange and I want to buy a tile that costs five orange.

468
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,598
Scott: I Can't put the nine in and take four back.

469
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:03,470
Scott: I have to pay with the nine and then take the tile.

470
00:30:03,651 --> 00:30:13,460
Scott: Yeah, the thing is if you pay with exact change Let's say I have a nine orange and the tile cost nine orange I buy it and then I get a free action.

471
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:19,040
Scott: so I could buy something and then take money on the same turn or Buy two things and take money where.

472
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:25,323
Scott: normally if you don't get any free actions Your turn is either buy something or take money.

473
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:27,370
Rym: Yeah, you get one action per turn.

474
00:30:27,932 --> 00:30:30,222
Rym: This is very much a game of when it's not your turn.

475
00:30:30,463 --> 00:30:31,729
Rym: There is nothing you can do.

476
00:30:32,311 --> 00:30:36,990
Rym: Don't try to think about your strategy because all it'll do is piss you off.

477
00:30:37,572 --> 00:30:42,710
Scott: Yeah, really in Alhambra you have no decisions and no actions that you may take when it's not your turn.

478
00:30:43,031 --> 00:30:44,113
Rym: Absolutely nothing.

479
00:30:44,174 --> 00:30:54,169
Scott: pestering people of course pestering which is key and you know paying a ten counting other people's Alhambra's and how many colors Are and then to see if you're ahead or behind and what moves you should make in the future.

480
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:56,888
Scott: But other than that, there's nothing you can do.

481
00:30:57,371 --> 00:31:03,210
Rym: Yeah, and the way the game works is every round you either draw money or buy an Alhambra tile or rearrange your Alhambra.

482
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:05,069
Rym: But that basically means wow, I suck.

483
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,837
Scott: Yeah This game is all managing actions.

484
00:31:08,218 --> 00:31:09,563
Scott: you get only one.

485
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:11,830
Scott: you get this pretty much the same number of actions as everyone else.

486
00:31:12,331 --> 00:31:14,098
Scott: You're not gonna get more or less and less.

487
00:31:14,158 --> 00:31:17,670
Scott: by some miracle the game ends on a certain players turn.

488
00:31:17,851 --> 00:31:22,388
Scott: You know and oh my god, you get maybe one extra turn of actions by.

489
00:31:22,409 --> 00:31:23,880
Scott: you know Some stroke of luck.

490
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,949
Scott: you can't count on that shit.

491
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:29,270
Rym: Yep Scoring rounds are semi random as in they occur at semi predetermined.

492
00:31:29,431 --> 00:31:42,310
Scott: Yes about one-third of the way through the game There's a scoring round and about two-thirds of the way through the game of the scoring There's a mechanic of putting the scoring rounds triggering cards in the deck at certain places and then the deck of money.

493
00:31:42,717 --> 00:31:43,389
Rym: Yeah, the deck of money.

494
00:31:43,751 --> 00:31:46,904
Scott: So the more people take money the faster the scoring grounds come.

495
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:48,230
Rym: now you take one action per turn.

496
00:31:48,451 --> 00:31:56,949
Rym: You can either take money because there are four money lying face-up and you can take any one money or any Number of money that are no more than five money's worth.

497
00:31:57,572 --> 00:32:05,503
Scott: So if there's a nine a six a two and a one out there you could take just the nine Just the six or you could take just the two or just the one.

498
00:32:05,563 --> 00:32:07,570
Scott: but you can also take the two and the one together.

499
00:32:07,771 --> 00:32:08,895
Rym: If there's all threes out there.

500
00:32:08,956 --> 00:32:10,000
Rym: just cry yourself to sleep.

501
00:32:10,301 --> 00:32:15,049
Rym: Yes, the same as if there's all like fours Yeah, or you can buy an alambra piece.

502
00:32:15,836 --> 00:32:22,189
Rym: now the way to win is To have more than other people of the various colors of alambra pieces in your thing.

503
00:32:23,351 --> 00:32:24,414
Rym: So there were.

504
00:32:24,454 --> 00:32:31,176
Rym: there are different numbers of the colors in the bag because they're secret and they're different Point values for each color.

505
00:32:31,236 --> 00:32:36,190
Rym: purple is worth the most red is worth at least but there's more purple tiles and less red tile.

506
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:39,164
Rym: Also purple tiles tend to be more aren't the blue tiles at least?

507
00:32:39,184 --> 00:32:47,411
Rym: the blue tiles at least blue Yeah, but the the better tiles the ones that there are more of and that are worth more points also tend to cost more Mm-hmm.

508
00:32:47,873 --> 00:32:52,648
Scott: So if you want there are like 11 towers in the game, but they all cost at least nine money.

509
00:32:52,668 --> 00:32:53,350
Scott: They're expensive.

510
00:32:54,592 --> 00:32:56,370
Rym: Also, we mentioned there's walls.

511
00:32:56,992 --> 00:33:03,512
Rym: There's also a game of placing your Alhambra together because you start with one open piece and you put a little color thing that says Who you are on it.

512
00:33:03,914 --> 00:33:08,970
Rym: when you buy a tile you stick it on your Alhambra and the rule of that is that walls?

513
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,569
Rym: cannot touch non walls.

514
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:14,139
Rym: You cannot have holes in your Alhambra.

515
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:17,370
Scott: Well, you can have a hole but you can't surround an empty space.

516
00:33:17,392 --> 00:33:24,490
Rym: Yes You can't have a full hole Yes, and you can't have a piece that a little dude couldn't walk to from any other part of your Alhambra.

517
00:33:24,771 --> 00:33:38,460
Scott: So if there was a purse an imaginary human being in your Alhambra and it was a real place He has to be able to walk from every place in your Alhambra to every other place in your Alhambra without Jumping over the table or jumping over a wall.

518
00:33:39,141 --> 00:33:41,647
Rym: and you can not rotate pieces.

519
00:33:42,168 --> 00:33:42,850
Scott: No, you can't.

520
00:33:44,193 --> 00:33:51,097
Rym: Unlike Carcassonne and The walls the other than making difficulty for you They are worth points.

521
00:33:51,418 --> 00:34:01,050
Rym: every time there's a scoring round in addition to all the points people get for tiles Everyone gets one point for each wall segment in their longest exterior wall.

522
00:34:01,531 --> 00:34:08,270
Rym: Yep, so there are many games in one but the games don't interfere with each other too much as long as you plan ahead.

523
00:34:08,678 --> 00:34:11,675
Scott: Yeah Alhambra is really a game about planning.

524
00:34:11,775 --> 00:34:21,889
Scott: some people will try to make a giant wall and the thing about making a giant wall Is that you lock yourself in your Alhambra becomes has a giant wall surrounding it?

525
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,469
Scott: And it becomes very difficult to add new tiles to it.

526
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:29,449
Scott: So even if you have the money to buy tiles You have nowhere to put them in the Alhambra where they will fit.

527
00:34:29,752 --> 00:34:31,324
Rym: You'll see the people who fall for this trap.

528
00:34:31,364 --> 00:34:38,760
Rym: at the end of the game they're buying pieces and putting them in their sideboard and then spending action after action trying to get these pieces into the Alhambra by Moving things around

529
00:34:38,922 --> 00:34:44,090
Scott: and in the meantime They're not buying any new tiles or getting any new money and everyone else is and they lose.

530
00:34:44,472 --> 00:34:47,429
Rym: Anytime you waste an action in this game, you just drop down a peg.

531
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:54,676
Scott: Yeah, if you ever have to rearrange your Alhambra or use the reserve board you're pretty much gonna lose unless by some.

532
00:34:54,716 --> 00:35:10,791
Scott: the only time I can see using the reserve board is if you have such a Extra mounds of money and you have it A tile that you can buy on this turn that someone else who's right up on your ass on the scoring track really needs to Win.

533
00:35:11,353 --> 00:35:21,250
Scott: you can buy that tile to prevent them from getting it and then let's say it's a tile That's going to ruin your Alhambra or it won't get you any points by adding it to your Alhambra.

534
00:35:21,531 --> 00:35:23,998
Scott: Just stick it in your sideboard and you it won't matter.

535
00:35:24,419 --> 00:35:28,090
Scott: That's the only real time I can see the reserve pile being useful.

536
00:35:29,191 --> 00:35:36,550
Scott: Other than that if you have to use that reserve board you better be scoring a zillion points with that action or else.

537
00:35:37,293 --> 00:35:40,990
Rym: Now we said there were four colors of money and there are all these colors of tiles.

538
00:35:41,512 --> 00:35:45,007
Rym: The way you buy a tile is like we said you don't get change back you whenever.

539
00:35:45,027 --> 00:35:46,454
Rym: if you pay too much You don't get it back.

540
00:35:46,514 --> 00:35:49,010
Rym: If you pay exact change you get a bonus by having another action.

541
00:35:49,931 --> 00:35:53,886
Rym: there are four colors of money and there's a little board that has four spots with the colors on them.

542
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:56,698
Rym: if A tile is sitting in the yellow spot.

543
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,329
Rym: You can only use yellow money on it.

544
00:36:00,911 --> 00:36:03,804
Scott: This is what really messes with the game is because there's no way you could.

545
00:36:03,844 --> 00:36:08,041
Scott: you can know what tile you need But you have no idea what color of money you will need to buy it.

546
00:36:08,684 --> 00:36:19,650
Scott: So you have to either concentrate on a few colors of money and hope the good tiles show up there or Just keep taking all colors of money and have a nice wide spread.

547
00:36:19,731 --> 00:36:22,207
Scott: So no matter what tile shows up you might be able to buy it.

548
00:36:22,952 --> 00:36:23,696
Scott: Of course then you won't.

549
00:36:23,777 --> 00:36:26,030
Scott: you might not have enough to buy really expensive tiles.

550
00:36:26,452 --> 00:36:28,020
Rym: So now there there is.

551
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:32,459
Rym: definitely is some luck involved in the game and you know Which tiles and which money come up when and in what order?

552
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:36,915
Scott: Yeah, there's significant luck, but it's not out of control It's it's much.

553
00:36:37,056 --> 00:36:44,290
Rym: it's less luck than even poker because as long as you're making good decisions The luck can't screw you so much and you'll do well in the end anyway.

554
00:36:44,671 --> 00:36:50,103
Rym: And if you're a better player than your friends in aggregate, you'll win more often Significantly more often.

555
00:36:50,504 --> 00:37:00,769
Scott: Yep, like people who don't know what they're doing in Alhambra will often take money when they don't need to or They will refuse to buy a tile for any exact change.

556
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:04,599
Scott: Even when it gives them a huge advantage and score wise.

557
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:13,780
Scott: or Maybe they'll hoard money hoping to buy a whole bunch of tiles, you know in the future But then they won't score in the first and second scoring rounds.

558
00:37:14,041 --> 00:37:17,080
Rym: Actually, I've done that to great effect by ignoring the first scoring round.

559
00:37:17,261 --> 00:37:20,700
Scott: Yeah, the first scoring round you can ignore but you can't ignore completely.

560
00:37:21,101 --> 00:37:26,217
Scott: Yeah, you can ignore it a little bit, but the second scoring round you can't ignore anymore because there's too many points.

561
00:37:26,418 --> 00:37:29,891
Rym: Yeah I mean the game is really fun.

562
00:37:29,972 --> 00:37:30,798
Rym: I really enjoy it.

563
00:37:31,441 --> 00:37:36,299
Rym: It starts to break down if everyone who's playing is very very very good at it.

564
00:37:36,802 --> 00:37:50,294
Scott: Yeah, if everyone is very very good at Alhambra and you're all playing together What ends up happening is the winner is determined by what money comes up Who draws what money at the beginning and what tiles show up when on which squares.

565
00:37:50,374 --> 00:37:52,220
Scott: because you can't do anything to anyone else.

566
00:37:52,381 --> 00:37:55,919
Scott: All you can do is do the best with what you get on your turn.

567
00:37:56,381 --> 00:38:10,340
Rym: but luckily it has the Carcassonne effect of even though you have very few actual decisions to make during the game and The game is very much, you know You're affected a lot by what happens and what comes up on the board and what money or what pieces appear.

568
00:38:11,702 --> 00:38:18,997
Rym: certain people still tend to win the game a lot more often than other people and The luck is really mitigated by the skill and the decision-making in the strategy.

569
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:29,017
Scott: Yep You're not gonna find a whole bunch of people who all have such a similar Strategy and thinking that they'll cancel each other out and the whole thing will come down to luck, but it could.

570
00:38:29,478 --> 00:38:34,675
Rym: it could happen Yep, and the game is definitely I mean Carcassonne is pretty much almost pure tactics.

571
00:38:34,695 --> 00:38:36,140
Rym: There's very little strategy involved.

572
00:38:36,723 --> 00:38:53,879
Rym: Alhambra is there's definitely a tactical element But it's much more strategic in that because there's so many turns and so many tiles even though you can't have a strategy turn to turn you can have a broad strategy and You'll be able to do it because the tiles will come up.

573
00:38:54,241 --> 00:39:00,707
Scott: Yeah, if you come up with a really specific strategy, like I'm going to buy all the green tiles That's not gonna do it.

574
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:11,987
Scott: a good strategy for Alhambra is I'm going to concentrate on the colors that other people don't concentrate on at least one of which will be one of the top Three colors of working points.

575
00:39:12,047 --> 00:39:20,140
Rym: Yep, or things like I'm gonna go after towers and such early in the game And then I'm gonna ignore them later in the game when everyone else is fighting over them and I'm gonna go.

576
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,599
Rym: I'm gonna go after walls for the first two rounds ignore them in the third round stuff like that.

577
00:39:24,242 --> 00:39:41,269
Scott: Or I'm gonna take a whole bunch of money early on and only buy a couple tiles in the first scoring round So that when the second score ground comes around and I have a better idea of what people have I will buy the tiles that other people don't have to Maximize my points versus them.

578
00:39:41,289 --> 00:39:43,380
Scott: So no one will be competing with me on the same colors.

579
00:39:43,641 --> 00:39:50,702
Rym: There's also the strategy of taking money and using money in such a way that you get the most number of exact change purchases Mm-hmm.

580
00:39:50,943 --> 00:39:53,633
Rym: that is key and a lot of people really forget that.

581
00:39:53,714 --> 00:40:01,146
Rym: or they'll see a piece and they want it so much They'll spend their money and buy it or they'll always take the big money when it comes up and they'll negotiate Like the little money.

582
00:40:01,186 --> 00:40:03,280
Rym: that's really useful to make exact change.

583
00:40:03,843 --> 00:40:06,980
Scott: Well, the thing about big money and little money is that in general?

584
00:40:07,882 --> 00:40:14,780
Scott: But if you take the big money You can buy the big tiles and the people who take the big money all the time will get more big tiles and more points.

585
00:40:15,021 --> 00:40:20,797
Scott: But if you get enough exact changes you can beat that and that's really the way to win.

586
00:40:20,858 --> 00:40:21,700
Scott: is the exact change?

587
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:27,970
Rym: Yeah, I found that the people who take the big money every time no matter what when it's there or when they need money They never have exact change.

588
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,017
Rym: They never win either.

589
00:40:29,037 --> 00:40:33,365
Scott: Yeah Well, you don't take the big money every time but let's you know Let's see if it you get.

590
00:40:33,385 --> 00:40:35,959
Scott: a look at what's in your hand when you take money is what it really is.

591
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:51,800
Scott: Yeah, if you've got say a four in your hand and you have a choice between Eight and a nine Well, you're gonna take the eight instead of the nine because there are there tiles out there that cost twelve and not really so Many.

592
00:40:51,841 --> 00:40:52,663
Scott: the cost thirteen.

593
00:40:53,304 --> 00:41:02,080
Rym: also if you see a situation like three one one are out there or two one one one It seems like whenever there's a situation like that people scoop it up.

594
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:08,204
Rym: Of course cuz getting all those little cards is real great to fill in the cracks between your exact change making machine Yep.

595
00:41:08,707 --> 00:41:11,142
Scott: However, here's a good example from the game I just played.

596
00:41:11,182 --> 00:41:16,140
Scott: I started the game with two yellow ones, right and I didn't spend them ever.

597
00:41:16,371 --> 00:41:19,269
Scott: No the opportunity never came up to spend those cards.

598
00:41:19,691 --> 00:41:31,280
Rym: the other problem with that is if you take a bunch of money cards that now puts a bunch of new money cards out which either may trigger a scoring round or May allow someone else to take the money you actually wanted because now they have a choice.

599
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:34,520
Scott: That's one aspect of the strategy of a lambda that I just ignore.

600
00:41:34,681 --> 00:41:41,873
Scott: I pay attention to the colors of the tiles the walls and The money and making sure I don't screw up my Alhambra and what other.

601
00:41:41,953 --> 00:41:48,156
Scott: I may pay attention to what other people have in their Alhambra, so I make sure mine isn't going to be competing with anyone who's too strong.

602
00:41:48,577 --> 00:41:49,340
Rym: See I count cards.

603
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,669
Rym: I pay attention to who's spending what colors money.

604
00:41:51,729 --> 00:41:53,957
Rym: so I know who has money what color and who doesn't.

605
00:41:54,299 --> 00:41:54,700
Scott: I pay attention.

606
00:41:55,523 --> 00:42:00,896
Rym: It's too much effort to pay attention that for me I don't keep it like specifically like I have no idea how much money someone has.

607
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:04,450
Rym: Oh, yeah I know I know trends like Pete's taking a lot of green money.

608
00:42:04,811 --> 00:42:07,160
Scott: Oh, yeah, I noticed that Scott's spending a lot of green money.

609
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:18,399
Scott: I noticed when someone takes a specific color of money a lot or I can look and see when someone is very there's a tile That's sitting out on the board and I can tell when someone really wants it and just scoop it out from under him.

610
00:42:19,182 --> 00:42:23,519
Scott: Or I can tell when a money comes up that someone really wants that particular money and I'll take it.

611
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:24,565
Scott: They don't get it.

612
00:42:24,847 --> 00:42:27,200
Rym: I really pay attention to when the scoring rounds are coming.

613
00:42:27,662 --> 00:42:31,320
Scott: I kind of pay attention when the scoring rounds are coming, but you know, it is sort of random.

614
00:42:31,701 --> 00:42:41,100
Scott: But I will look at the size of the deck and be like, okay the first scoring rounds coming up I often will take a bunch of money early on to try and blitz the first scoring round.

615
00:42:42,282 --> 00:42:44,332
Scott: That can work depending on what tiles show up.

616
00:42:44,894 --> 00:42:48,640
Rym: Yeah, I mean it once again That's a tactical decision more so than a strategic one.

617
00:42:48,981 --> 00:42:51,071
Scott: Yeah, I just kind of play it as it goes.

618
00:42:51,131 --> 00:42:56,786
Scott: every turn I look I see the four tiles I see the four money and I do the best I can Pretty much.

619
00:42:56,847 --> 00:43:03,815
Scott: if I can buy something for exact change I'll almost always do it unless it's going to screw up my Alhambra origins to useless piece.

620
00:43:04,036 --> 00:43:07,756
Scott: Yeah, there isn't like sometimes someone else will have.

621
00:43:08,862 --> 00:43:14,480
Rym: If everyone else has four three three and two towers respectively, you're not gonna buy that tower for exact change.

622
00:43:14,741 --> 00:43:17,435
Scott: I think that's all the towers in the game actually four five six seven eight.

623
00:43:17,455 --> 00:43:18,520
Scott: Yeah, there's eleven towers.

624
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,947
Scott: I think so on three three three three.

625
00:43:20,967 --> 00:43:25,520
Scott: Yeah, you know buying the one tower won't help you unless it's got some really nice walls.

626
00:43:26,681 --> 00:43:32,660
Scott: Yeah, but I think what happens is that the tiles that have more walls are cheaper than the ones that have less walls.

627
00:43:32,741 --> 00:43:34,199
Rym: Yeah, but they restrict you a lot.

628
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:45,050
Scott: So the tile that has three walls on it the pink the tower with three walls is cheaper than the tile would note the tower With no walls, but they both count equally as towers.

629
00:43:45,812 --> 00:43:55,960
Scott: So if you build your Alhambra really slick like You can fit the three walled pieces in without limiting your options and also make a nice.

630
00:43:56,502 --> 00:44:01,680
Scott: You know don't go for the longest wall because you don't get special bonus points for longest wall.

631
00:44:02,042 --> 00:44:03,770
Scott: You get points for having a wall.

632
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:06,000
Scott: So you just need to have your wall sufficiently long.

633
00:44:06,082 --> 00:44:14,525
Scott: Yeah You know increases the gap between you and the other players because you're gonna get more points from the scoring rounds than you'll ever get From the walls ever though.

634
00:44:14,545 --> 00:44:18,680
Rym: I've seen people do very well with a wall heavy but not wall centric strategy.

635
00:44:18,841 --> 00:44:21,780
Rym: Yes, I mean there are people who they don't have so much in this car grounds.

636
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:25,254
Rym: They just have this massive wall because it keeps getting points.

637
00:44:25,676 --> 00:44:28,140
Scott: Mm-hmm Yep, the wall will score points.

638
00:44:28,341 --> 00:44:29,747
Rym: No one can take those going around.

639
00:44:29,968 --> 00:44:39,460
Rym: basically if you can get a big wall in the first scoring round That's fantastic because that doesn't go away and in the first scoring round the wall is worth more than the scoring round is.

640
00:44:39,601 --> 00:44:44,649
Rym: I mean basically in the first round the first scoring round Every wall you have counts it.

641
00:44:44,709 --> 00:44:51,040
Rym: consider it three points because it's gonna be scored two more times Yeah, and then the wall becomes less and less valuable as the game goes on.

642
00:44:52,264 --> 00:45:01,359
Scott: Yeah, that's one good thing Especially because the wall tile the heavy wall tiles are cheaper and early in the game You have less money because you've been taking it for less time.

643
00:45:01,781 --> 00:45:12,780
Scott: you can buy the tiles that are wall heavy make a big wall without limiting yourself too much and Get a bunch of points and then the rest of the game buy the more expensive tiles to get the colors.

644
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:17,880
Rym: But the bigger wall you make the harder it is to expand later when you're buying a lot of tiles later.

645
00:45:18,283 --> 00:45:19,251
Rym: Yeah, I said later twice.

646
00:45:19,271 --> 00:45:19,715
Rym: Yeah

647
00:45:20,862 --> 00:45:33,549
Scott: Yeah, yeah, if you make a stupid wall that you know cuts off like the top of your Alhambra and the left of your Alhambra Well now any tiles that were that need to be attached to the top or left You're not gonna be able to put him in.

648
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:34,111
Rym: was it?

649
00:45:34,132 --> 00:45:35,780
Rym: you repeat who made the?

650
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:41,900
Rym: Alhambra that basically had three of the three wall pieces and then there's a hole in the top and they were screwed.

651
00:45:41,981 --> 00:45:42,464
Rym: I think it was paid.

652
00:45:42,484 --> 00:45:44,760
Scott: I think I did it once or Pete did it once I don't know.

653
00:45:44,861 --> 00:45:53,407
Rym: I did something similar where I Didn't have any open spaces to the top or left of my Alhambra and all the pieces that were coming out only had holes For a top or left placement.

654
00:45:53,810 --> 00:45:55,760
Rym: No, I couldn't put anything in my Alhambra.

655
00:45:56,702 --> 00:46:04,254
Scott: I think a good way to make an Alhambra is to just kind of stretch it out You know make it really long as you can and then sort of make branches.

656
00:46:04,314 --> 00:46:09,913
Scott: that way you can add any tile you want Onto the branches without needing to you know cut off.

657
00:46:09,993 --> 00:46:15,120
Scott: if you have a square Alhambra or you know Generally a blob then you can cut it off too easily.

658
00:46:15,682 --> 00:46:22,340
Scott: So if you make one that sort of branches out like a like a fractal You know just like a branch here to branch there.

659
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:26,360
Scott: Then you can attach wall pieces to those without limiting your options.

660
00:46:26,621 --> 00:46:32,480
Rym: Yep, plus I mean my general strategy there is to always have at least one hole in every cardinal direction.

661
00:46:32,942 --> 00:46:41,120
Scott: Yep, I try to keep one hole in every cardinal direction and you know Sometimes I can't and I'm willing to sacrifice one if the tile is really important.

662
00:46:41,241 --> 00:46:47,639
Scott: Yeah, especially near the end of the game when I won't be getting many more tiles But early on I really try to keep it open.

663
00:46:48,081 --> 00:46:53,817
Rym: Yep, because it's sticking on one of those wall this tiles into a hole will just suddenly open your board up like crazy.

664
00:46:54,499 --> 00:47:04,959
Rym: Yep Now in terms of rearranging your Alhambra We have yet to see an instance where doing it meant anything other than you fucked up earlier in the game And now you're losing.

665
00:47:05,582 --> 00:47:16,060
Rym: I've never seen someone win after rearranging the Alhambra ever because rearranging the Alhambra is the game Obviously is doing it as sort of a punishment, but you can still keep playing the game.

666
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,695
Rym: You're not totally done, but you still can't win.

667
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:19,319
Rym: it punishes you.

668
00:47:19,922 --> 00:47:23,880
Rym: Yeah, you can either take a piece from your sideboard and put it on your Alhambra.

669
00:47:24,762 --> 00:47:29,852
Rym: Now if you put it in the sideboard, that means it didn't fit in your Alhambra Which means it's probably not gonna fit now either.

670
00:47:29,892 --> 00:47:33,107
Rym: unless you built a whole bunch of stuff You can swap it.

671
00:47:33,509 --> 00:47:36,300
Scott: if you you know, there might be some really ever tile.

672
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:40,415
Rym: But I point out swapping a piece that just you still waste an action.

673
00:47:40,475 --> 00:47:41,679
Scott: because no waste an action.

674
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:45,098
Rym: now You've spent an action and you still have a piece in your sideboard.

675
00:47:45,319 --> 00:47:49,120
Scott: Yep It's only worth it if the piece is worth so many points.

676
00:47:49,341 --> 00:47:55,838
Scott: It's like this incredibly rare instance that you know It would be useful and they allow you to do it in that incredibly rare instance.

677
00:47:55,898 --> 00:48:03,892
Scott: that way You know in case the game gets super crazy, you don't just lose because you can't do something Yep, or you can take a piece out of your Alhambra.

678
00:48:04,273 --> 00:48:05,760
Rym: Those are the only three options.

679
00:48:06,241 --> 00:48:09,267
Rym: So it usually to do anything useful with the sideboard.

680
00:48:09,307 --> 00:48:11,071
Rym: You have to spend at least two actions.

681
00:48:11,432 --> 00:48:20,096
Scott: Mm-hmm Sideboard and that's one action and then the next turn you have to put the tiles.

682
00:48:20,176 --> 00:48:22,766
Scott: so either swap the tile Which is the best situation?

683
00:48:22,887 --> 00:48:25,679
Scott: Well, no, the best situation is not doing anything at all.

684
00:48:26,263 --> 00:48:28,200
Scott: Yeah, not using the sideboard.

685
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:33,760
Scott: But you know the next best option is you swap it and then insert the tile on the next turn.

686
00:48:34,882 --> 00:48:39,099
Scott: One good strategy I've noticed is you buy something and you put it in the sideboard and you let it sit there.

687
00:48:39,761 --> 00:48:47,710
Scott: Then you just keep playing the game as usual and eventually at some point you buy something for exact change And then take the tile from the sideboard and bring it in.

688
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,076
Rym: Yeah, that's a good strategy.

689
00:48:49,096 --> 00:48:54,260
Scott: with the free action You know, it's like I don't have a place for this now, but I need it and I'll have a place for it later.

690
00:48:55,101 --> 00:49:02,718
Scott: You know you make a place with buying something for exact change bring it in on the free action and you didn't really lose an Action for that and it's it works pretty well.

691
00:49:04,022 --> 00:49:05,130
Rym: Now there's also a fun mechanic.

692
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,540
Rym: at the end of the game the game ends.

693
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,999
Rym: I mean, there are two scoring rounds about 1/3 and about 2/3 of the way through the game.

694
00:49:10,802 --> 00:49:14,318
Rym: Then there's the final scoring round which happens when the bag of tiles runs out.

695
00:49:15,301 --> 00:49:17,409
Rym: the rule there and I just thought this was needs.

696
00:49:17,449 --> 00:49:30,527
Rym: at the end of the game when there are no more tiles left the fall the tiles that are left are put in the little buying box the little board and Whoever has the most money in their hand at the end of the game of each color Gets whatever tile.

697
00:49:30,547 --> 00:49:31,916
Rym: it was in the case of a tie.

698
00:49:31,956 --> 00:49:32,540
Rym: No one gets it.

699
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:41,143
Scott: so if you have the most green money and there's one tile left in the green spot at the end of the game you get That and the same for yellow orange blue, whatever It just.

700
00:49:41,224 --> 00:49:43,772
Rym: it makes the end game even if there's no more tiles.

701
00:49:43,832 --> 00:49:44,976
Rym: you need or you can't.

702
00:49:44,996 --> 00:49:46,884
Rym: you don't have enough money and the game Is gonna end soon.

703
00:49:47,165 --> 00:49:50,059
Rym: You can still go for that and there's still some decisions to make.

704
00:49:51,061 --> 00:49:58,652
Scott: Yeah, generally what I do is because new tiles are put into the number one spot first Which I think is I don't know what color it is.

705
00:49:58,672 --> 00:49:59,697
Scott: I don't have the board right here.

706
00:49:59,717 --> 00:50:00,770
Rym: Yeah I don't remember.

707
00:50:00,811 --> 00:50:02,203
Scott: Oh, yeah The tiles.

708
00:50:02,384 --> 00:50:08,660
Scott: when the new tiles come out they're placed in the top left spot on the little board first Which is a particular color of money.

709
00:50:09,362 --> 00:50:21,518
Scott: So towards the end of the game if you pretty much aren't buying too much any more stuff Start collecting that color of money and the second color of money because those are the spots most likely to contain a tile up For auction at the end.

710
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:27,900
Rym: Yeah, the last space is least likely because there's a bunch of mechanics to keep people from cheating or putting tiles.

711
00:50:28,081 --> 00:50:30,959
Rym: You know where they'd be useful to them on your turn.

712
00:50:31,753 --> 00:50:32,843
Rym: You know You buy your action.

713
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,710
Rym: you either buy a tile or you take a card.

714
00:50:35,072 --> 00:50:37,160
Rym: when your turn is over you replenish whatever is there.

715
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:40,120
Rym: So if you took two money cards, you draw two more money cards.

716
00:50:40,603 --> 00:50:42,780
Rym: If you bought four tiles you put out four new tiles.

717
00:50:43,382 --> 00:50:49,140
Rym: You have to place the tiles on the board in the order that you draw them in the order on the board.

718
00:50:49,862 --> 00:50:52,864
Scott: Yeah, so if you draw a tile you look at it and you say ooh I really need this.

719
00:50:52,884 --> 00:50:54,312
Scott: and then you say I have a lot of orange money.

720
00:50:54,332 --> 00:50:55,660
Scott: You just put it on the orange spot.

721
00:50:55,782 --> 00:50:56,520
Scott: Well, that's no good.

722
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:01,740
Scott: You have yet to put it in the top leftmost spot and then the top right and then the bottom left in the bottom, right?

723
00:51:02,422 --> 00:51:04,660
Scott: Depending on which ones are open and available.

724
00:51:05,622 --> 00:51:07,314
Rym: Now all in all a lumber is a solid game.

725
00:51:07,334 --> 00:51:09,283
Rym: I love it Very solid.

726
00:51:09,304 --> 00:51:10,708
Scott: so I won this field this yard.

727
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:12,093
Rym: Yeah, it's also.

728
00:51:12,113 --> 00:51:12,354
Rym: it was 2003.

729
00:51:12,354 --> 00:51:12,856
Rym: I think that it won it.

730
00:51:15,141 --> 00:51:16,645
Rym: It's also a very fun game.

731
00:51:16,666 --> 00:51:18,671
Rym: It's it's actually pretty quick.

732
00:51:19,033 --> 00:51:21,480
Rym: It's very very easy to teach to people.

733
00:51:21,902 --> 00:51:26,380
Scott: Yeah, this is a game where you don't have to be a crazy strategy gamer guy to play it.

734
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:30,586
Scott: You know families can play this game pretty easily You know, you just got to get them to do it.

735
00:51:30,827 --> 00:51:36,166
Rym: and while the strategies can be fairly complex in terms of actual thinking power The game is very light.

736
00:51:36,428 --> 00:51:38,160
Rym: You can play the game and have a conversation.

737
00:51:38,563 --> 00:51:40,999
Rym: You can play the game while people are watching a movie on TV.

738
00:51:41,442 --> 00:51:42,929
Rym: You can play the game while friends are over.

739
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:44,476
Rym: you can play the game while you're drunk.

740
00:51:44,938 --> 00:51:56,411
Scott: Yep, and While someone who's big on strategy and will win more often People who don't have a lot of strategy or thinking can still play and have fun Yep, even though they'll get their asses handed to them.

741
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:58,784
Rym: Yeah, but the way the game works You never really.

742
00:51:58,844 --> 00:52:01,600
Rym: even if you're losing you never really feel like you're wasting your time.

743
00:52:01,729 --> 00:52:11,731
Scott: Yeah Because even if you're really terrible at the game you still collect money at generally the same rate as everyone else and you still buy Tiles because no one can interfere with you.

744
00:52:11,751 --> 00:52:13,740
Scott: You just do whatever you do on your turn.

745
00:52:14,141 --> 00:52:19,360
Scott: You'll just be doing less on your turn than other people, but you'll still be buying tiles and making a happy Alhambra, which is fun.

746
00:52:19,681 --> 00:52:20,805
Rym: It's one of those rare games.

747
00:52:20,845 --> 00:52:25,885
Rym: That's very beginner friendly, but also very hardcore gamer friendly Mm-hmm.

748
00:52:26,247 --> 00:52:28,240
Scott: Now there's some expansions which I've never played.

749
00:52:29,102 --> 00:52:31,620
Rym: Yeah, they seem to be trying to pull with this what they pulled with Carcassonne.

750
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:35,755
Scott: Yeah, where they have two billion expansions, but I don't know about them.

751
00:52:35,775 --> 00:52:36,819
Scott: I haven't played them yet.

752
00:52:37,161 --> 00:52:40,755
Rym: Maybe if we ever get them, it's all you because I bought all those Carcassonne expansions.

753
00:52:41,016 --> 00:52:42,140
Scott: That's because you own Carcassonne.

754
00:52:42,401 --> 00:52:44,788
Rym: Yeah, I own a longer - that's right bastard.

755
00:52:44,969 --> 00:52:46,213
Rym: Yeah, you're not getting any.

756
00:52:46,434 --> 00:52:48,340
Scott: I don't buy games that require expansions.

757
00:52:48,461 --> 00:52:49,329
Rym: They're not for you.

758
00:52:49,349 --> 00:52:50,197
Scott: That's right.

759
00:52:51,781 --> 00:52:57,680
Scott: But he said yeah any game that requires expansions or has expansions is definitely a bad road to go down.

760
00:52:57,882 --> 00:52:58,920
Rym: Well, it's I mean Carcassonne.

761
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,271
Rym: We talked about it a while ago the inns and cathedrals.

762
00:53:02,331 --> 00:53:06,946
Rym: expansion takes a good game and makes it great Like it fixes everything with the.

763
00:53:06,966 --> 00:53:10,860
Scott: you know, if that's the thing then that should be the game and the other expansion shouldn't exist.

764
00:53:11,382 --> 00:53:12,227
Rym: Yeah, well it came out later.

765
00:53:12,247 --> 00:53:13,854
Rym: I mean look the river was an expansion.

766
00:53:13,895 --> 00:53:14,960
Rym: then they just threw it in the game.

767
00:53:15,201 --> 00:53:17,130
Scott: Yeah, and of course that's a bad expansion.

768
00:53:17,290 --> 00:53:19,460
Rym: Yeah, it's a beginner's expansion.

769
00:53:19,581 --> 00:53:21,692
Scott: I say well settlers has expansions.

770
00:53:21,954 --> 00:53:22,999
Scott: It's also a game you have.

771
00:53:23,361 --> 00:53:24,684
Rym: Yeah, but settlers is broken.

772
00:53:24,744 --> 00:53:29,496
Rym: like settlers was real fun until I got good at games and realized that settlers is broken.

773
00:53:29,816 --> 00:53:30,097
Scott: Yeah.

774
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:33,547
Rym: Oh Well, I think that the point was really driven home.

775
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:39,245
Rym: when I played in a sanctioned settlers tournament at ubercon a while ago Came down to the dice rolls.

776
00:53:39,446 --> 00:53:42,715
Rym: Yep, like the first two rounds I won but it was.

777
00:53:42,775 --> 00:53:46,468
Rym: I mean there was a wide range of skills and Decisions would end the game.

778
00:53:46,589 --> 00:53:50,939
Rym: Yeah, you make a decision you win you lose The fight the semi-finals where I got knocked out.

779
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:56,620
Rym: I will always say that every single person in my game of four was equally good and we were all just sitting there.

780
00:53:56,761 --> 00:53:58,479
Rym: No one would trade with anyone.

781
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:11,455
Rym: yeah, like there were maybe four or five trades in the whole game and the points were like three three three three three four three three three three three four And it was like nine nine nine nine and then someone got ten.

782
00:54:11,475 --> 00:54:16,917
Rym: Yeah Everyone made the exact optimal decision at every point and it just came down to the dice.

783
00:54:17,339 --> 00:54:20,380
Scott: Mmm Yeah, Alhambra doesn't have that problem.

784
00:54:20,922 --> 00:54:34,863
Rym: Yeah, I mean it seems random what tiles come up, but all the decisions are made by you and by the other players Mm-hmm, so there's not so much there's no game driven randomness so much, but there's a lot of player driven not randomness But unpredictability.

785
00:54:35,325 --> 00:54:38,397
Scott: Yeah, another thing about Alhambra is that the game itself is really nice.

786
00:54:38,417 --> 00:54:42,008
Scott: It has nice Cardboard boards has nice wooden pieces.

787
00:54:42,068 --> 00:54:43,573
Scott: The tiles are really nice.

788
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:55,449
Scott: the cards, you know, I usually hate You know, I like the cart little cardboard token money or chip money mostly and Card money is like, you know second best to that.

789
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:56,873
Rym: The worst is paper money.

790
00:54:56,913 --> 00:55:01,729
Scott: paper money is absolute crap, but the Cardboard money and Alhambra isn't bad.

791
00:55:01,769 --> 00:55:04,219
Scott: It's like great because it's like your hand of cards.

792
00:55:04,279 --> 00:55:05,665
Rym: Yes It doesn't even feel like money.

793
00:55:05,685 --> 00:55:06,890
Rym: It feels like a card game.

794
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:14,059
Scott: Yeah, it feels like I got a hand of cards in my you know Which is really cool Easy to manage everything works out nice.

795
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:18,995
Rym: Yeah, it's a cheap high production value good game for anyone of any level of board gaming skill.

796
00:55:19,356 --> 00:55:19,497
Scott: Hmm.

797
00:55:20,099 --> 00:55:22,630
Scott: Yep Alhambra.

798
00:55:22,651 --> 00:55:26,247
Rym: Oh, yeah, and We thought about talking about another game today.

799
00:55:26,287 --> 00:55:27,512
Rym: We've already gone almost an hour.

800
00:55:27,993 --> 00:55:28,716
Scott: But have we really?

801
00:55:28,817 --> 00:55:36,333
Rym: yeah, okay Which is good because that means you know a year from now We'll still have Tuesday episodes because we won't just do all of our games and run out.

802
00:55:37,035 --> 00:55:37,456
Scott: That's fine.

803
00:55:37,476 --> 00:55:38,600
Scott: We'll just have to buy more games.

804
00:55:39,082 --> 00:55:40,046
Rym: I have a feeling next week.

805
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:43,540
Rym: We'll either talk about the new Mario DS game that we both beaten.

806
00:55:43,801 --> 00:55:45,045
Scott: I think that's what we're gonna talk about.

807
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:47,675
Rym: and we'd like to talk about Stratego at some point.

808
00:55:48,056 --> 00:55:49,060
Scott: Well, yeah, we'll do that.

809
00:55:49,281 --> 00:55:50,385
Rym: It's you know, I mean, it's all crap.

810
00:55:50,405 --> 00:55:53,256
Rym: Milton Bradley game, but we bought it for like four bucks.

811
00:55:53,276 --> 00:55:54,742
Scott: It was ten bucks Oh us.

812
00:55:54,963 --> 00:55:55,887
Rym: Yeah, it's still worth it.

813
00:55:56,188 --> 00:56:03,780
Scott: And we pretty much any Milton Bradley or Parker Brothers game is $15 or less depending on the number of pieces and we played the hell out of it.

814
00:56:04,162 --> 00:56:09,170
Rym: And now that we're older and wiser and know about German games We actually have insightful things to say about Stratego.

815
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:09,752
Rym: Mm-hmm.

816
00:56:10,375 --> 00:56:11,540
Scott: All right, we can maybe do in two weeks.

817
00:56:11,782 --> 00:56:13,299
Rym: Yeah, we'll do that at some point cool.

818
00:56:14,002 --> 00:56:18,496
Rym: So once again, welcome all the new listeners from all the other podcasts who have mentioned us.

821
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:32,885
Rym: Yay Bangkok Yeah, he actually made a comment in the email he sent us about How the inside it's not.

822
00:56:32,925 --> 00:56:37,540
Rym: it's hard to tell if our inside jokes are just American isms or if it's just us being weird.

823
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:40,589
Scott: No, our inside jokes are very inside.

824
00:56:40,669 --> 00:56:43,558
Rym: Yeah, most Americans have no idea what we're talking about.

825
00:56:43,658 --> 00:56:47,174
Scott: Just geeks Yeah, but apparently even people have no idea what we're talking about.

826
00:56:47,235 --> 00:56:50,667
Scott: Think we're hysterical, you know We're not trying to be hysterical like comedians.

Scott: This is what we're always like.

828
00:56:52,433 --> 00:56:53,878
