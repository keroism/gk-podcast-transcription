1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,225
Rym: It's Monday October 30th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:14,325 --> 00:00:15,650
Rym: We whine about wine.

3
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,433
Scott: Let's do this Now.

4
00:00:20,635 --> 00:00:21,019
Rym: normally.

5
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:24,201
Rym: this is where I say We had a crazy weekend.

6
00:00:24,221 --> 00:00:25,307
Rym: We were out in blah blah blah.

7
00:00:25,327 --> 00:00:28,423
Rym: We're exhausted But I got to say for the first time in a while.

8
00:00:28,463 --> 00:00:33,729
Rym: We didn't really go anywhere We didn't really do a lot, and I'm totally well rested and ready to go.

9
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:38,704
Scott: Could that be because of our extra hour of awesome man?

10
00:00:38,724 --> 00:00:41,559
Rym: that extra hour this year was so good I mean last year.

11
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,094
Rym: I didn't even notice I totally forgot.

12
00:00:43,114 --> 00:00:44,179
Rym: I got an extra hour today.

13
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:53,470
Rym: well and yesterday in the day before that extra hour Just seemed to pervade my entire life and as a result I'm totally well rested ready to go and yet I got a lot done over the weekend.

14
00:00:54,092 --> 00:00:59,928
Scott: Not only was I real well rested not only did I get a lot done, but I didn't go to work today.

15
00:00:59,948 --> 00:01:03,143
Rym: now Why pray tell did you not Scott go to work today?

16
00:01:03,244 --> 00:01:11,934
Scott: well cuz about four in the morning I had some stomach pains And there's no way I'm going to work with stomach pains because a if I don't make it to work That's the worst thing ever.

17
00:01:12,154 --> 00:01:14,282
Rym: no because that you know not all right.

18
00:01:14,482 --> 00:01:19,058
Scott: go on because I see if I do make it to work The toilet there is the worst thing ever.

19
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:27,610
Rym: I submit that attempting to go to work with stomach problems Not making it and going home is not the worst thing in the world because it's a private shame.

20
00:01:28,452 --> 00:01:29,661
Rym: No one sees it.

21
00:01:29,883 --> 00:01:30,588
Rym: I didn't know one.

22
00:01:30,669 --> 00:01:35,018
Scott: no I don't mean it's the worst thing in the world literally But it's something I'd like to avoid.

23
00:01:35,038 --> 00:01:37,970
Scott: is the worst thing is I really don't want to poop all over my nice new car.

24
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:44,410
Rym: See the worst thing in the world to be if you're going to meet the president of the United States And the premier of China and your future girlfriend.

25
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,958
Rym: And then it happens suddenly and violently.

26
00:01:46,998 --> 00:01:55,250
Scott: and then Hitler is reanimated every orifice and shoots you and oh It's from violent for every orifice at the worst possible moment.

27
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:58,259
Scott: And then you are the resurrection of Hitler and you get shot.

28
00:01:58,741 --> 00:02:01,570
Rym: someone remind you find out that the resurrection of Hitler.

29
00:02:02,151 --> 00:02:04,497
Rym: Then you get shot by the bionic commando.

30
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:07,485
Rym: Yeah, let captain rad lad Spencer.

31
00:02:07,505 --> 00:02:09,310
Rym: Yeah exactly something like that.

32
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,456
Rym: Yeah for all Super Joe's awesome.

33
00:02:11,476 --> 00:02:13,542
Rym: He spends that whole game in a POW camp.

34
00:02:14,043 --> 00:02:22,198
Scott: anyway for all my not going to work I didn't tell anyone at my work that I wasn't coming to work today I didn't tell my boss.

35
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:28,270
Scott: usually I send him an email like hey I'm not coming to work today cuz you know I work in an office in the middle of nowhere all alone.

36
00:02:29,012 --> 00:02:30,877
Scott: I didn't say anything to anyone.

37
00:02:31,339 --> 00:02:33,264
Scott: I wasn't contacted at all today.

38
00:02:33,284 --> 00:02:35,210
Scott: No one noticed that I was gone.

39
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:36,135
Scott: I did nothing.

40
00:02:36,216 --> 00:02:41,049
Scott: I was at my house, and that was that crazy out of control.

41
00:02:41,692 --> 00:02:58,190
Rym: So anyway as most of you from last week know we got our brand new super fancy dual-chain compressor Last Thursday and bit by bit I'm learning how to use it because it has a lot more functionality and a lot more fine-tuning than the previous compressor we had.

42
00:02:59,014 --> 00:03:03,777
Scott: Yeah, it looks like it has one extra knobbly And the other compressor did.

43
00:03:03,878 --> 00:03:04,883
Rym: it also has more button.

44
00:03:04,923 --> 00:03:08,637
Scott: it also has a lot more buttons And it has two compressors not one.

45
00:03:08,778 --> 00:03:14,638
Rym: so we have a total now of three compressors one of which at one without a power cable Which we'll get eventually eventually.

46
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:27,690
Rym: so I guess my heads up now is that for the next week at least I'm going to be doing the show as normal listening to the show on my way to work and Learning how to use this compressor better because the compressor is so much more powerful.

47
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:34,550
Rym: I think at this point I can make the show sound pretty much perfect as in better than your average radio station.

48
00:03:34,972 --> 00:03:51,970
Scott: You have no idea how annoying this is for me because I'll be sitting in my room minding my own business and all I hear From Rym is he's basically screaming throughout the house Testing Moving knobbly I often Yell the most or Jack Thompson and power book.

49
00:03:52,612 --> 00:03:57,488
Scott: Yeah, he's just yelling around the house, and he's just sitting there moving knobs and yelling.

50
00:03:57,608 --> 00:03:58,170
Scott: move knobs.

51
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:04,990
Scott: Yeah, it really sucks to sit in a house trying to do something while someone else is you know moving knobs and yelling?

52
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:08,380
Scott: And I'm trying to read a book At least when I do my mind.

53
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,067
Rym: I mean that's not most of my testing.

54
00:04:10,107 --> 00:04:10,770
Rym: most of my testing.

55
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:18,230
Rym: I'm playing savage white witch at crazy volumes while fiddling with the compressor in real time and listening to it on headphones.

56
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:20,536
Scott: That's why don't you keep the headphones on?

57
00:04:20,557 --> 00:04:21,882
Rym: I have that phones on anyway.

58
00:04:22,324 --> 00:04:24,834
Scott: put up put a box over your head So I don't hear you yelling.

59
00:04:24,854 --> 00:04:26,441
Rym: Yeah, you could deal with my yelling.

60
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:30,193
Scott: Yeah, whatever old yeller Has it you are.

61
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:36,470
Rym: yeah, so we're back to normal and hopefully the show is going to sound tiny bits better day by day.

62
00:04:36,532 --> 00:04:49,490
Rym: So once again I've noticed a funny trend that About half the people who've mentioned the compressor said that you couldn't hear a difference and the other half said that the difference was noticeable And important and I noticed a distinct age correlation between the two.

63
00:04:50,891 --> 00:05:03,646
Rym: Granted my sample size is very small so all I ask is that if you notice that a particular episode of GeekNights Sounds particularly better or particularly worse or you or anything particularly annoying in the next week.

64
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:04,448
Rym: Let me know.

65
00:05:04,468 --> 00:05:08,127
Rym: otherwise I think I can handle the optimization of this thing on my own.

66
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:08,610
Rym: at this point.

67
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:15,310
Scott: Why don't we try to make like a 128 mp3 one day just to have an extra high-quality episode or something?

68
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,098
Scott: Ah, then people could really see if there's a difference.

69
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:24,626
Rym: true true because a lot of the difference will be lost in the mp3 NIST though not as much since we use a higher bitrate than most podcasts.

70
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:25,209
Scott: Yeah, we do.

71
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:26,052
Scott: Anyway,

72
00:05:26,373 --> 00:05:29,501
Rym: so you got some news being I got a science and so

73
00:05:29,842 --> 00:05:38,243
Scott: Seagate who you might remember bought max store The lot, you know with creating the largest hard drive manufacturer in the universe

74
00:05:38,363 --> 00:05:44,078
Rym: also unifying the house of Rym and Scott because I have Been a lifelong max tour user

75
00:05:44,299 --> 00:05:46,485
Scott: and I have been a lifelong Seagate user

76
00:05:46,606 --> 00:05:48,030
Rym: and with their powers combined.

77
00:05:49,043 --> 00:05:49,408
Rym: I don't know.

78
00:05:50,415 --> 00:05:51,139
Scott: It's funny though.

79
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,230
Scott: How you know, I was the Seagate user.

80
00:05:53,310 --> 00:06:00,010
Scott: You're the max store user and max store is now like the cheap value line and Seagate is the real deal.

81
00:06:00,732 --> 00:06:08,382
Rym: Anyway, I think that has more to do with the names and the target markets because both companies brought a lot of good technology to The table.

82
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:12,442
Scott: well I think what they found out was what Seagate found out when they bought max store.

83
00:06:12,462 --> 00:06:18,322
Scott: is the people who buy max store drives Really don't intersect to the people who buy Seagate drives at all.

84
00:06:18,643 --> 00:06:20,490
Scott: And that's why it was such a profitable venture.

85
00:06:20,591 --> 00:06:22,065
Scott: They got so many new customers.

86
00:06:22,408 --> 00:06:23,131
Rym: Yep Yep Plus.

87
00:06:23,151 --> 00:06:29,156
Rym: they got max tours crazy tech in addition to their own crazy tech because they both had Innovated in the hard drive market.

88
00:06:29,176 --> 00:06:32,810
Scott: Yeah, but Seagate and Hitachi really do most of the hard drive innovating.

89
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:35,699
Scott: Anyway, IBM used to yeah, they used to not anymore.

90
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,510
Scott: So Seagate is innovated yet again in hard drive technology.

91
00:06:39,671 --> 00:06:40,136
Rym: Oh, really?

92
00:06:40,237 --> 00:06:50,656
Scott: They have a new You know technology called drive trust and what this does is the hard drive is gonna encrypt itself even right now.

93
00:06:50,736 --> 00:07:06,829
Scott: if I wanted to I could set up a loopback device or Something else in order to encrypt all the data on my hard drive which means that no one can get the data off my hard drive without a key or a Password or maybe a physical key or something like that.

94
00:07:07,451 --> 00:07:20,810
Scott: so if you took my computer and ran away you couldn't get any of my personal information off the disk or if I was arrested or the FBI took my computers and they tried to figure out if I had illegal stuff on there.

95
00:07:20,871 --> 00:07:22,465
Scott: They couldn't find anything because it's encrypted.

96
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:29,790
Rym: now There are a lot of questions regarding this sort of thing and a lot of pros and cons regardless of the answers.

97
00:07:30,392 --> 00:07:35,770
Scott: Yeah, I mean right now there aren't too many details other than they're gonna put it in hard drives.

98
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:39,784
Scott: We don't know if they're gonna put in every hard drive or just some hard drives.

99
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:41,410
Scott: It's proprietary.

100
00:07:41,872 --> 00:07:46,527
Scott: But if other hard drive manufacturers want to use it, though, I guess they're gonna sell it to them.

101
00:07:46,808 --> 00:07:48,581
Rym: the technology Yeah, they'll probably license it.

102
00:07:48,723 --> 00:08:02,649
Scott: Yeah, and You're gonna have to enter the password on the computer or something like that, you know It doesn't say whether that's a BIOS level thing adjust after the BIOS thing or an OS thing.

103
00:08:03,131 --> 00:08:16,150
Rym: Well, I'll imagine that if this comes to pass then it won't be long before there are special motherboard things Where you can have a chip on the motherboard that handles all this for you And you just wherever the chip goes the hard drives will be encrypted.

104
00:08:16,933 --> 00:08:21,830
Scott: I really think the best way to go about this is to have some sort of physical like a USB key.

105
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:27,311
Scott: I was just about to say that actually little dongle, but it doesn't look like that's what it's gonna be Not yet.

106
00:08:27,372 --> 00:08:29,678
Scott: It also doesn't say the strength of the encryption.

107
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:33,549
Scott: if this encryption is weak, then what's the point really?

108
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:34,254
Rym: Well, that depends.

109
00:08:34,274 --> 00:08:36,370
Rym: I mean weak is a relative term.

110
00:08:36,496 --> 00:08:46,170
Rym: Yeah I mean if you use like standard kinds of encryption if a super government entity really wants to get your data They can get it in a reasonable amount of time in a lot of cases.

111
00:08:46,531 --> 00:09:01,130
Rym: The thing is if encryption is ubiquitous if everything is encrypted and people are always encrypting stuff It doesn't matter that a supercomputer can break one guy's encryption Because it now greatly increases the barrier to snooping on anyone.

112
00:09:01,572 --> 00:09:11,730
Scott: Yeah, also even a hundred and twenty eight bit encryption Which is pretty low considering lots of people out there using like 4096 Diffie Hellman crazy batshit stuff.

113
00:09:11,871 --> 00:09:18,150
Scott: Yeah with GPG 128 bit takes years and years and years and years and years.

114
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:22,527
Scott: There's really not a computer that can solve it in a reasonable amount of time.

115
00:09:22,668 --> 00:09:25,980
Rym: now more Importantly this kind of hardware encryption.

116
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,790
Rym: one important drawback is that let's say Something happens and the hard drive is compromised in some way physically.

117
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,350
Rym: You know you break it or something fails in it or the little encryption thing dies.

118
00:09:37,073 --> 00:09:39,303
Rym: It's gonna be a lot harder if not impossible.

119
00:09:39,324 --> 00:09:40,710
Scott: It's gonna be impossible pretty much.

120
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,723
Scott: They said it's gonna be impossible to get the data off.

121
00:09:42,844 --> 00:09:47,990
Scott: a data recovery Company will basically not be able to recover your data if something happens.

122
00:09:48,231 --> 00:09:51,630
Rym: Yeah, I mean unless I mean obviously if something happens to the encryption mechanism.

123
00:09:51,851 --> 00:09:57,270
Rym: Yeah, because if the actual key is still intact on the hardware then the company can almost always get the data off

124
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:57,711
Scott: Mm-hmm,

125
00:09:58,013 --> 00:10:10,029
Rym: but even then you have to remember that anytime you encrypt something not just in this specific instant But in general you're also increasing the chance that you will lose that data forever Because it makes it much harder to recover that data if something bad happens.

126
00:10:10,351 --> 00:10:16,030
Scott: Yeah, I mean if you set a password for the drive, and you forget the password you're pretty much screwed.

127
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:20,030
Scott: There's gonna be no way to recover that password at all.

128
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:23,724
Scott: You're gonna have to throw the hard drive out or return it to Seagate or something.

129
00:10:23,925 --> 00:10:24,648
Rym: I ran into that.

130
00:10:24,728 --> 00:10:26,564
Scott: a couple data You're certainly not gonna get back.

131
00:10:26,665 --> 00:10:41,904
Rym: at IBM We had these special chips in the motherboards of a lot of systems that were security things and you could implement high security Which meant that if anything fishy happened the computer was rendered permanently inoperable And the motherboard had to be replaced.

132
00:10:42,347 --> 00:10:43,434
Rym: Wow It was.

133
00:10:43,595 --> 00:10:45,404
Rym: that was for high security things.

134
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:46,430
Rym: that wasn't used often.

135
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:57,210
Rym: But every now and then I'd try to install Linux on some box to stick out somewhere in the factory And I'd run into that and the only option was to ship the motherboard back to the factory and get a new motherboard.

136
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,999
Scott: Alright, let me just read.

137
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:01,250
Scott: I want to read three short things from the article here.

138
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:11,990
Scott: It says even data recovery specialists would not be able to help if the assigned password somehow gets lost said Scott Shimamura Senior product manager at Seagate.

139
00:11:12,612 --> 00:11:13,474
Scott: That's the trade-off.

140
00:11:13,594 --> 00:11:18,788
Scott: anytime you introduce back doors or holes to circumvent the security then you've created vulnerability.

141
00:11:18,948 --> 00:11:27,269
Scott: He said Seagate said it is already implemented technology into one of its drives for laptops and another for digital video recorders.

142
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:28,677
Scott: So that's not so bad.

143
00:11:28,697 --> 00:11:30,550
Scott: I mean for regular computers.

144
00:11:31,172 --> 00:11:33,519
Scott: That's sort of like alright what I really need it for.

145
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:46,054
Scott: I can do it in a different way that is guaranteed to work on My computer and that you know, I'm responsible for but for a digital video recorder or a digital camera Or something like that.

146
00:11:46,074 --> 00:11:51,590
Scott: This is actually pretty good because you know, you're switching drives in and out of these things all the time.

147
00:11:51,992 --> 00:11:55,810
Scott: You know, maybe I want to take some pictures that are pretty hot and I don't want anyone to look at him.

148
00:11:56,211 --> 00:12:05,220
Scott: so I password protect my little tiny hard drive that I use in my video camera, then I take that hard drive out and You know, my Rym wants to use the camera.

149
00:12:05,401 --> 00:12:10,802
Scott: he pops his hard drive in there which has a different password So you can keep your videos secret from other people.

150
00:12:11,223 --> 00:12:13,855
Scott: that's not dependent on the camera But the drive itself.

151
00:12:13,956 --> 00:12:21,070
Rym: but at the same time this can be used by companies that want to make DVRs to make it more difficult to get at your data when they apply DRM.

152
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,469
Rym: Yeah, it also.

153
00:12:25,232 --> 00:12:35,522
Rym: Now a lot of people think oh if I ever get busted by the MPAA or the government for whatever shady things I'm doing or whatever weird illegal pornography I may have.

154
00:12:35,863 --> 00:12:36,846
Rym: I'll just have it encrypted.

155
00:12:36,907 --> 00:12:45,130
Rym: No one can get me Even if the government can't get the data if they get a hold of the hard drive and you refuse to give up the key.

156
00:12:45,672 --> 00:12:53,722
Rym: There are a lot of laws and methods where the government can punish you at least in the United States For not furnishing the key so they can access your data.

157
00:12:53,762 --> 00:12:58,830
Scott: Yeah, this sort of crazy legal stuff However, that's how the EFF got started was dealing with that issue.

158
00:12:58,970 --> 00:12:59,411
Scott: However,

159
00:12:59,632 --> 00:13:21,110
Rym: one nice thing is that in many cases though it varies widely depending on what's going on and the severity of your crime and All sorts of things it might be better off if you did something bad not giving up the key anyway Because if you've committed a bad enough crime the penalty for not giving up The key is probably less even at maximum than the penalty for whatever you're charged with.

160
00:13:21,813 --> 00:13:23,099
Scott: Yes, but I guess it's good.

161
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:29,750
Scott: then for people who want to do illegal things Seagate isn't gonna allow any backdoors into the encryption.

162
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:35,590
Rym: So the thing is I wish I had a way to verify that Seagate really wasn't putting backdoors in the encryption.

163
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:38,441
Scott: I know but it seems like I can trust them.

164
00:13:39,023 --> 00:13:40,930
Scott: There hasn't been a reason to distrust Seagate yet.

165
00:13:41,593 --> 00:13:42,699
Scott: They've done pretty good stuff.

166
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:43,885
Scott: All their drives are awesome.

167
00:13:43,945 --> 00:13:49,830
Rym: So hey So anyway in science news straight up science news for a change now.

168
00:13:50,676 --> 00:13:52,913
Rym: there has been a lot of Controversy though.

169
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:59,190
Rym: when I say controversy, I mean in the same way that there's quote-unquote controversy concerning the theory of evolution.

170
00:14:00,231 --> 00:14:13,570
Rym: There's been a big thing for a long time now about how vaccines that contain Mercury somehow cause autism in children, which I'll say right now is absolutely not true.

171
00:14:13,891 --> 00:14:26,470
Rym: There have been mountains of studies and there's crazy amounts of data saying that this is completely not true in any way shape or form And there's not only not any chance of causation, but there isn't even a correlation.

172
00:14:27,773 --> 00:14:30,550
Scott: As in there are people who didn't get vaccines and have autism.

173
00:14:30,771 --> 00:14:37,750
Rym: No as in there's no statistical link whatsoever and the people who posit this are total nutbags.

174
00:14:38,273 --> 00:14:38,776
Scott: Uh-huh.

175
00:14:38,796 --> 00:14:39,439
Rym: No credible.

176
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,310
Scott: So they have no evidence whatsoever.

177
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:49,344
Rym: Now basically what happened was in recent years autism has been on the rise Which is a very misleading thing to say though.

178
00:14:49,364 --> 00:14:50,310
Rym: It is technically correct.

179
00:14:50,813 --> 00:14:53,610
Rym: Autism has been reported more frequently in recent years.

180
00:14:54,071 --> 00:15:01,790
Rym: However, it wasn't until recently that autism was better defined and easier to diagnose and more precise to diagnose.

181
00:15:02,372 --> 00:15:17,425
Rym: so we don't know if autism is actually more prevalent or if we've just figured out better how to differentiate between someone who's mentally retarded and someone who is spectrum autistic or spectrum asperger's Asperger's asparagus errs.

182
00:15:17,727 --> 00:15:19,710
Scott: Yeah Okay, yeah.

183
00:15:20,371 --> 00:15:23,415
Rym: so now besides the thing is basically we don't know anything.

184
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:32,837
Scott: if we or we know relatively little about a lot of this stuff and Some people think that they know and they're saying what something as if it's true without any evidence whatsoever Yeah

185
00:15:33,162 --> 00:15:39,564
Rym: well I mean like 50 years ago Someone who was autistic would probably not be recognized as autistic because it didn't matter.

186
00:15:39,624 --> 00:15:46,537
Rym: the end result was that the child had severe Difficulty and they generally treated them like any other Developmentally challenged child.

187
00:15:46,918 --> 00:15:54,229
Rym: and now that there's a lot of federal funding and science has improved we are able to diagnose it more and a lot of whack jobs are saying that.

188
00:15:54,631 --> 00:15:59,832
Rym: Therefore because we're seeing more autism something must be causing it Mm-hmm.

189
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:07,870
Rym: Now we honestly as humans as scientists still don't know Exactly what causes autism spectrum disorder?

190
00:16:08,471 --> 00:16:15,690
Rym: In fact, we barely understand how it happens or what effects it has or how to treat it or anything.

191
00:16:16,212 --> 00:16:18,258
Rym: It's this huge horrible mystery.

192
00:16:18,338 --> 00:16:22,390
Scott: Is anyone studying the DNA to see as the people have different genes or something?

193
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:25,890
Rym: Yes, and there are some links but not those links are not universal.

194
00:16:25,911 --> 00:16:34,825
Rym: Oh there are genes that show a predisposition toward autism and things like that and Men are by far more likely to be autistic than women.

195
00:16:35,147 --> 00:16:38,321
Scott: Mm-hmm They should start looking in that little Y guy there.

196
00:16:39,205 --> 00:16:40,310
Scott: I bet you'll find something.

197
00:16:41,358 --> 00:16:47,069
Scott: Yeah Probably more complicated than that probably but it still sounds like a right idea to me.

198
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:57,162
Rym: Yeah So the news here is that because these autism been coming up more and more supposedly people have been looking for a scapegoat especially the parents of children who are autistic.

199
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:08,915
Rym: they want someone to blame and people preying on this have decided that the cause of autism is Mercury in the Preservatives for vaccines.

200
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:13,609
Scott: because there's something that I mean does these people really have it against vaccines?

201
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,257
Scott: Yes, are they like those Christian?

202
00:17:15,438 --> 00:17:18,597
Rym: whatever they are as many of them are but not all of them Uh-huh.

203
00:17:18,698 --> 00:17:19,390
Rym: It all comes down.

204
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:31,243
Rym: The one that gets the most press is the substance called the marisol which contains mercury and is used not only in many vaccines Especially in the third world but in all sorts of other medicines.

205
00:17:31,364 --> 00:17:35,349
Rym: It's actually fairly common Especially outside of the United States.

206
00:17:36,252 --> 00:17:38,090
Rym: It's been in vaccines for a long time.

207
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,460
Scott: So why is it more common outside the United States?

208
00:17:40,701 --> 00:17:48,590
Rym: because it's been phased out for newer better things Uh-huh in the United States, it's not used in that many vaccines anymore though for any of you who got a flu shot.

209
00:17:49,092 --> 00:17:55,750
Rym: It is in most flu vaccines and I know for a fact that it was in the flu vaccine I received as a critical care worker.

210
00:17:56,712 --> 00:18:05,917
Rym: In fact, I have a funny anecdote here where I was sitting ready to get my you know vaccine from my work and I'm sitting there and I asked the guy hey is there any the marisol in this vaccine?

211
00:18:06,639 --> 00:18:18,812
Rym: and he stops and he looks at me and he very cautiously says something like Why do you ask are you one of those people who believes that the marisol causes disorders such as Autism?

212
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:23,670
Rym: and I looked at him with a straight face and laughed and said no, I'm not one of those nut jobs.

213
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:35,910
Rym: I was just curious and he expressed to me that I was probably the first person who was not a scientist or doctor He had ever met who said the word the marisol and was not a crazy nut job.

214
00:18:37,872 --> 00:18:41,230
Scott: So did you ask him if he had actually encountered crazy nut jobs and what they were like?

215
00:18:41,491 --> 00:18:51,090
Rym: we had a little small talk and he said that he's had a lot of people refused the vaccine because they were afraid that Like guys would refuse the vaccine because they're afraid that it would give their yet-to-be-born children autism.

216
00:18:51,351 --> 00:18:59,970
Scott: I have a feeling that those people while they might believe that are actually Subconsciously coming up with an excuse because they don't want to get a shot.

217
00:19:00,613 --> 00:19:03,327
Rym: Alright, that's actually not a bad posit there.

218
00:19:03,347 --> 00:19:08,990
Rym: Yeah So anyway the news here because I've gotten kind of off topic is that this group of whack jobs?

219
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:20,686
Rym: for a long time has been seeking to force the FDA to put restrictions on or ban the use of the marisol and Finally it has been decided and the decision is now public.

220
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:29,972
Rym: the FDA Rejected it entirely and basically called them nut jobs saying that their claim has absolutely no merit and that all of the evidence points to Contrary.

221
00:19:30,434 --> 00:19:31,176
Rym: now awesome.

222
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,762
Rym: Here's where it gets interesting one.

223
00:19:32,842 --> 00:19:33,946
Rym: I'm glad the system works.

224
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:34,910
Rym: Hooray FDA.

225
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,355
Rym: Sometimes dr.

226
00:19:37,435 --> 00:19:43,680
Rym: Mark Greer one of the people on the side of the whack job says quote We're not accepting that answer.

227
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,729
Scott: what what are you gonna do?

228
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,023
Rym: I don't know.

229
00:19:47,490 --> 00:20:01,361
Rym: But the whack jobs don't accept it and they still say despite the fact that every scientist in the world with any shred of I don't know what to say.

230
00:20:01,381 --> 00:20:02,650
Rym: These people are just crazy.

231
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,642
Scott: Goddamnit frickin apple juice causes AIDS and I know it.

232
00:20:06,803 --> 00:20:10,354
Scott: you got a bad apple juice, man No more.

233
00:20:10,595 --> 00:20:14,130
Scott: Well, we're not going to because apple juice doesn't cause AIDS apple juice cause they.

234
00:20:16,914 --> 00:20:18,009
Rym: So I bring it up.

235
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:26,569
Rym: I thought I saw this in the news last week and I made it my news mostly just because this whole of the meri I mean Scott knows there are some hot buttons with me.

236
00:20:27,011 --> 00:20:29,176
Rym: There are certain topics that that were.

237
00:20:29,297 --> 00:20:40,669
Rym: the people involved are just so stupid and they just they're so unwilling to listen to logic reason or evidence that I just like my head catches on fire.

238
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:49,708
Rym: if Even if the topic comes up if Scott walks into my room, I'm trying to go to sleep and he's like the Marisol I'll just lay there and see you for another hour.

239
00:20:51,152 --> 00:21:00,456
Rym: see Things of the day.

240
00:21:00,476 --> 00:21:02,262
Scott: I got a pretty hot thing of the day.

241
00:21:02,443 --> 00:21:03,467
Rym: I got an okay thing of the day.

242
00:21:03,487 --> 00:21:05,539
Scott: Oh Okay is your thing of the day?

243
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:10,534
Rym: Well, it involves politics and pornography All right.

244
00:21:10,635 --> 00:21:12,529
Scott: Anyway, my thing it is much better than that.

245
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:17,042
Rym: Yeah, it involves a sport that probably hardly anyone listening cares about.

246
00:21:17,062 --> 00:21:17,684
Scott: it's not.

247
00:21:17,965 --> 00:21:19,048
Scott: it's not about the sport.

248
00:21:19,449 --> 00:21:32,318
Scott: Yeah Yeah, it's about even I think anyway, Michael Schumacher is Probably statistically speaking the greatest motorsport racer to ever have lived and he still lives.

249
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:43,288
Scott: he just retired a week ago or so and He is the second highest paid athlete in the entire world as of right now beaten only by what Tiger Woods.

250
00:21:43,328 --> 00:21:46,130
Scott: Tiger Woods is The only one who makes more money than Michael Schumacher.

251
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:51,110
Scott: In fact, they have a lot in common because they're both individual athletes and not team guys and whatever.

252
00:21:51,813 --> 00:22:08,879
Scott: So being retired and living in Switzerland, even though he's German Michael Schumacher one of his sponsors is shell shell gasoline and So on his day off he went to the shell station and they did some sort of promotional event there.

253
00:22:08,899 --> 00:22:18,170
Scott: and what they did is they put hidden cameras all over the gas station and Michael Schumacher did a whole bunch of funny things and they made I guess these are commercials.

254
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:37,327
Scott: I don't know if they're actually gonna use them for commercials but they made a bunch of funny little videos and the first one there's a guy pulls into the gas station and Michael Schumacher puts out the little lollipop stick that says stop just like in the pit stops and the real races and The whole pit crew jumps out and soups up this guy's car.

255
00:22:37,668 --> 00:22:44,410
Rym: granted While it is definitely filmed to look like one of those, you know sudden out of the blue catch a guy by surprise thing.

256
00:22:44,974 --> 00:22:46,950
Rym: I wouldn't be surprised if that was totally staged.

257
00:22:47,152 --> 00:22:51,538
Scott: Yeah, that one might have been totally staged But it really kind of seems like they.

258
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:57,878
Scott: the way I read the article is that they spent all day at this shell station So just doing weird stuff.

259
00:22:57,938 --> 00:23:00,270
Scott: Yeah, and then they you know, they had hidden cameras everywhere.

260
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,116
Scott: So they eventually caught a good one.

261
00:23:02,156 --> 00:23:07,962
Rym: probably my favorite one is where they've just got that little display and he's just standing in the middle Of it in the store like hey, I'm yeah.

262
00:23:08,143 --> 00:23:18,690
Scott: in the second video they just had this big red piece of cardboard and he stands there pretending to be a statue of himself and People are like looking at him and poking him and he's just standing there.

263
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:22,149
Rym: He winks at a guy once and the guy just goes like oh my god is really him.

264
00:23:22,411 --> 00:23:35,458
Rym: Yeah, see we gotta understand that while in America I'll bet most of you have no idea who Michael Schumacher is or care about him at all But in other countries, especially in Switzerland where he is right now He is he's like Michael Jackson.

265
00:23:35,618 --> 00:23:36,683
Rym: everyone who sees him goes.

266
00:23:36,743 --> 00:23:37,807
Rym: That's Michael Schumacher.

267
00:23:37,868 --> 00:23:47,808
Scott: Holy crap Yeah, imagine if he went into a shoe store and Tiger Woods was There's like a big piece of cardboard and he was standing there like a statue and you just walked in.

268
00:23:47,828 --> 00:23:49,868
Scott: you look at him And he doesn't move.

269
00:23:50,831 --> 00:23:52,258
Scott: That's exactly what this is.

270
00:23:52,358 --> 00:23:53,484
Scott: Only it's a guy you might not.

271
00:23:53,524 --> 00:23:54,469
Rym: that's what this is.

272
00:23:55,251 --> 00:24:00,769
Scott: You know Tiger Woods is probably might be the best golfer ever and this guy's the best car driver ever.

273
00:24:01,894 --> 00:24:09,609
Scott: and the third one is actually also kind of funny because he there's a guy comes up to get gas and he has like the loyalty card for shell gasoline.

274
00:24:09,629 --> 00:24:15,930
Scott: and The guy, you know points out that if he has the loyalty card he can get his picture taken with Michael Schumacher.

275
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:20,510
Scott: So it goes inside to the gas station and Michael Schumacher just like comes right up behind.

276
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,479
Scott: It was like hey what you doing?

277
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,020
Rym: The guy's like, holy crap The guy seems to lose it like he doesn't know what to do.

278
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:32,530
Scott: He's that kind of celebrity deer in headlights thing Yeah, and he gets his picture taken with him shakes hands and he goes on his way.

279
00:24:33,131 --> 00:24:38,347
Scott: But the funniest part of that is that you can see just how small Michael Schumacher is.

280
00:24:38,447 --> 00:24:42,218
Scott: tiny little dude Guys who drive an f1.

281
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:50,470
Scott: they're really fit because they have to you know Withstand all those g-forces and have quick reaction times and all that, but they're small.

282
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:56,850
Scott: I mean if you're a big guy You can have trouble fitting into a tiny tiny car and you're gonna add weight to the car.

283
00:24:56,911 --> 00:24:57,630
Scott: That's unnecessary.

284
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:10,197
Rym: See the first time I realized they were little because I just never thought about it is when I finally watched some more f1 races And I started noticing that when they bring out the magnum of champagne to spray around at the end It looks real big.

285
00:25:10,378 --> 00:25:11,340
Scott: it is pretty big

286
00:25:11,541 --> 00:25:14,610
Rym: but it looks a lot bigger than that thing should look

287
00:25:14,851 --> 00:25:22,590
Scott: especially because you only see these race car drivers outside of their cars when they're standing on the podium or they're at the press conference and

288
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:22,852
Rym: It

289
00:25:22,952 --> 00:25:25,590
Scott: is when they're standing next to each other and they're all small.

290
00:25:25,831 --> 00:25:29,850
Rym: It's like if you saw a movie about halflings and the only people in it were halflings.

291
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:36,390
Scott: They probably wouldn't know they were halflings probably not Squat but and you know wider than they are at all.

292
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:39,661
Scott: But yeah, but halflings as long as the proportions were correct, you wouldn't know.

293
00:25:39,942 --> 00:25:41,769
Rym: kind of like hobbits kind of like hobbits.

294
00:25:43,451 --> 00:25:46,220
Scott: So yeah, this is this is pretty awesome these videos right here.

295
00:25:46,802 --> 00:25:49,190
Rym: All right, so like I said politics and pornography.

296
00:25:50,072 --> 00:26:04,696
Rym: So some Republican candidate George Allen, he's the one there's even this whole thing in the Political climate and the midterm elections in the US because this is a. in the United States I know we have a lot of foreign listeners So I don't want to just act like US.

297
00:26:04,736 --> 00:26:06,682
Rym: politics is all that matters because it totally isn't.

298
00:26:07,043 --> 00:26:16,881
Rym: but we're having our midterm elections very soon which a week from tomorrow most people in America don't bother with Because you're not electing a president or anything.

299
00:26:16,922 --> 00:26:17,806
Rym: Most people care about.

300
00:26:17,846 --> 00:26:22,609
Rym: you're just electing Various members of our two houses of Congress and a bunch of local stuff.

301
00:26:23,614 --> 00:26:34,649
Rym: So this year it's really important because among other things It looks like the Republicans might lose control of our House of Representatives which has a lot of ramifications for the years to come.

302
00:26:35,551 --> 00:26:36,795
Rym: Big guns now the.

303
00:26:36,916 --> 00:26:51,348
Rym: the interesting thing is that the Republicans this year have by and large been running extremely vicious negative campaigns against the Democrats Accusing them of being pedophiles and evil Nazis on the side of al-qaeda all sorts of stuff.

304
00:26:51,408 --> 00:26:51,910
Rym: It's crazy.

305
00:26:52,693 --> 00:26:56,310
Rym: It's also kind of hilarious to people like us who don't really care about these people.

306
00:26:56,731 --> 00:27:04,475
Rym: Yeah, so this George Allen this Republican ran an ad with excerpts from his opponent's Pornography.

307
00:27:04,515 --> 00:27:09,739
Rym: you see opponent had written Some pornographic literature in his day.

308
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:13,510
Scott: Wasn't there a guy that was being investigated a while ago that wrote a porn?

309
00:27:13,612 --> 00:27:14,226
Scott: What was his name?

310
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,760
Rym: Scooter Libby, I believe yeah, that was the guy.

311
00:27:16,781 --> 00:27:18,430
Scott: he freakin wrote a porno book.

312
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:22,410
Rym: So it turns out that a lot of politicians have written pornography.

313
00:27:22,852 --> 00:27:26,085
Scott: Really maybe I should write some porn and then run for office.

314
00:27:26,306 --> 00:27:27,370
Rym: so on slate here.

315
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:31,260
Rym: They've got this fun little exercise where they list a whole bunch of politicians.

316
00:27:31,862 --> 00:27:32,503
Scott: and how many?

317
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:40,966
Rym: uh a through M. Holy shit Let's see we got Barbara boxer who I'm a fan of William Buckley Jimmy Carter written porn.

318
00:27:41,046 --> 00:27:44,689
Rym: Jimmy Carter Newt Gingrich Joseph Nye Kenneth Starr.

319
00:27:45,516 --> 00:27:46,624
Scott: They all wrote porn.

320
00:27:46,644 --> 00:27:50,322
Rym: uh Winston Churchill What so?

321
00:27:50,442 --> 00:27:51,590
Rym: and then it lists?

322
00:27:52,355 --> 00:27:57,590
Rym: for a number of Pornographic excerpts, I'm gonna flip through.

323
00:27:57,831 --> 00:27:59,717
Scott: Oh, so they didn't write actual porno.

324
00:27:59,737 --> 00:28:00,460
Rym: some of them did.

325
00:28:00,781 --> 00:28:05,839
Scott: some of them did but they might have just written a paragraph or two That could be skewed as pornographic.

326
00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:09,456
Rym: or some of them are straight-up pornographic.

327
00:28:09,718 --> 00:28:15,741
Rym: some of them just happen to have vicious or Vivid pornography in them.

328
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:17,350
Rym: They're varying levels of pornography.

329
00:28:18,052 --> 00:28:24,894
Scott: All right, all right cuz I was under the impression that all these people wrote porno books to be sold in porno stores Which is not the case.

330
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:27,709
Rym: All right, here's a. here's a quote from the first one here.

331
00:28:28,493 --> 00:28:31,748
Rym: Suddenly the pouting sex kitten gave way to Diana the huntress.

332
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:37,270
Rym: She rolled on to him and somehow was sitting a thwart his chest her knees pinning his shoulders.

333
00:28:37,732 --> 00:28:40,407
Rym: Tell me or I'll make you do terrible things.

334
00:28:40,508 --> 00:28:40,930
Rym: She hissed.

335
00:28:41,891 --> 00:28:44,549
Rym: All right, who wrote that I didn't even read the results part?

336
00:28:45,312 --> 00:28:50,050
Rym: The exercise here is that you have to match each politician with their pornographic excerpts.

337
00:28:51,470 --> 00:29:01,962
Rym: Okay, it's fun to try lol, so anyway today being science tech computers and Considering Scott had some very important success with wine.

338
00:29:02,343 --> 00:29:05,615
Rym: We would like to talk about wine Not the kinds of drink.

339
00:29:05,956 --> 00:29:17,869
Rym: No, no, no, even though the icon for the wine we're talking about is the kind of drink also, not the thing that People who are mad about this the marisol rejection rejection would do after they lost.

340
00:29:20,131 --> 00:29:23,303
Rym: That's good, yeah, I wanted to say the word rejection twice.

341
00:29:23,403 --> 00:29:25,049
Rym: I've been wanting to do that for a while now.

342
00:29:25,553 --> 00:29:27,570
Scott: Dejection is much better All right.

343
00:29:27,972 --> 00:29:31,649
Rym: So we thought we'd talk about it because a lot of people really don't know what it is.

344
00:29:32,011 --> 00:29:37,210
Rym: A lot of people who use Linux don't realize it exists and the fact that it can make their lives a lot easier or harder.

345
00:29:37,852 --> 00:29:43,554
Rym: And also it is in the recent year gotten incredibly better Incredibly better.

346
00:29:43,694 --> 00:29:48,550
Rym: like two years ago wine was very different and very less useful than it is today.

347
00:29:49,271 --> 00:29:50,314
Scott: Well, let's start at the beginning.

348
00:29:50,615 --> 00:29:56,670
Scott: recently Linux has been getting a big push mostly because of Ubuntu and edgy and such.

349
00:29:57,555 --> 00:30:04,989
Scott: Yeah, it's becoming real popular and you know I've been encouraging people to just try it out because you can pop the live CD and just try it out.

350
00:30:05,872 --> 00:30:08,500
Scott: We know now risk to your computer no money.

351
00:30:08,801 --> 00:30:11,550
Scott: it costs you one CD and a few minutes of your time.

352
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:14,963
Rym: In fact, if you really want you can get a free CD from Ubuntu.

353
00:30:15,184 --> 00:30:15,786
Scott: Yeah, they'll send you.

354
00:30:15,887 --> 00:30:16,690
Scott: I have official CDs.

355
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,514
Scott: I'll mail you one.

356
00:30:17,595 --> 00:30:18,520
Scott: I don't have too many though.

357
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,390
Scott: So I can't get too many requests.

358
00:30:20,497 --> 00:30:27,058
Rym: I mean I even gave one of my co-workers an Ubuntu CD Ubuntu and He ended up installing it on some old computer.

359
00:30:27,078 --> 00:30:30,747
Rym: he has and he loves it and he couldn't believe how far Linux has come from The last time he tried it.

360
00:30:31,011 --> 00:30:33,673
Scott: Yeah, but one One hang up.

361
00:30:33,713 --> 00:30:40,873
Scott: a lot of people have from totally switching to Ubuntu or Linux in general is that you can't run your Windows Applications.

362
00:30:40,933 --> 00:30:44,870
Scott: I mean sure let's say you used Microsoft Office in Windows.

363
00:30:45,031 --> 00:30:51,090
Scott: Well, you don't really need Microsoft Office in Linux because you have open office so big deal, but let's say you need Visio.

364
00:30:51,712 --> 00:30:56,750
Scott: Well, yeah Visio is a perfect example, even though there's a program called dia that does almost the same thing.

365
00:30:56,891 --> 00:31:03,042
Rym: Yeah, but yeah, if you use Visio at your work You can't use anything else because your files won't work with the people who have Visio.

366
00:31:03,243 --> 00:31:07,429
Scott: or let's say you have some fun games Like steam that you really want to play.

367
00:31:07,811 --> 00:31:16,050
Scott: Well, one solution is to dual boot where you reboot your computer to Windows run your Windows applications Reboot your computer to Linux use your Linux applications.

368
00:31:16,472 --> 00:31:21,170
Scott: That's not really a good thing because now you're wasting all this time rebooting.

369
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:25,345
Scott: You might as well just use Windows if you really need those applications.

370
00:31:25,445 --> 00:31:33,250
Rym: Yeah, I mean back at RIT I used Windows instead of Linux as my OS because I played more games than I did anything else on my computer back then.

371
00:31:33,553 --> 00:31:38,622
Scott: Oh, yeah, absolutely It wasn't until PC gaming slowed down that I was able to go to Linux.

372
00:31:38,662 --> 00:31:44,109
Rym: full-time like that was pretty much the hang-up Yep, but now PC gaming is starting to pick up again at least for us.

373
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,900
Scott: Well, at least it is with on Steam that there's.

374
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,808
Scott: so there's so many games on Steam now.

375
00:31:48,868 --> 00:31:49,330
Scott: Oh my god.

376
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:55,730
Rym: Well consider this depth between Def Con Half-Life 2 Counter-Strike source the ship and the upcoming natural selection source.

377
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:01,267
Rym: That's enough to make me buy a badass freaking computer and play games again.

378
00:32:01,407 --> 00:32:01,568
Rym: Yeah.

379
00:32:01,949 --> 00:32:02,170
Scott: All right.

380
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:20,335
Scott: So let's say you're really like Linux you want to use it full-time But let you have one or two Windows applications that are Windows only applications that you really need in order to continue doing business and they're preventing you from going to Linux which you might like better or Like equally or whatever.

381
00:32:20,596 --> 00:32:24,670
Rym: or you're just cheap and you don't want a pirate windows or you're cheap and you don't want a pirate windows.

382
00:32:25,591 --> 00:32:27,398
Scott: The solution is wine.

383
00:32:27,538 --> 00:32:30,790
Rym: Now wine is actually an acronym and this is very important.

384
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:38,245
Rym: We're not gonna go into technical detail But we're gonna try to explain in somewhat layman terms exactly what this does because wine stands for.

385
00:32:38,346 --> 00:32:39,970
Rym: wine is not an emulator.

386
00:32:42,111 --> 00:32:43,978
Scott: WINE is not an emulator.

387
00:32:44,058 --> 00:32:49,470
Rym: a lot of people when they hear about wine the way people describe it and I'm guilty of this Say, oh, yeah, it's a Windows emulator.

388
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:59,529
Rym: So you run it in Linux and then in that you can run Windows programs and it's like having a tiny little Windows Which is kind of true, but it's really misleading as to what wine actually does.

389
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:13,044
Scott: Yeah, that an emulator really is something that you know mimics a computer like it will emulate an actual Machine and take machine instructions and carry them out as if it were a different computer.

390
00:33:13,084 --> 00:33:15,150
Rym: Yeah, like Plex 86 is an emulator.

391
00:33:15,492 --> 00:33:18,390
Scott: Oh, yeah box Bo CHS is an emulator.

392
00:33:18,537 --> 00:33:30,609
Scott: Yes You run box on like a power PC computer and it pretty much creates an x86 computer in software and then you install an operating system on this fake computer and it.

393
00:33:32,172 --> 00:33:33,194
Rym: Well, I could go into detail.

394
00:33:33,295 --> 00:33:40,747
Rym: basically that sounds really inefficient and that's because it is really inefficient it is now What is wine if it's not an emulator?

395
00:33:40,788 --> 00:33:54,358
Scott: Well When you have a computer you have instructions that you tell that the processor, you know Chip the pen the Pentium chip at the Athlon chip, whatever you got in there that it your Frickin assembly language.

396
00:33:54,901 --> 00:33:56,770
Scott: God, why did I completely lose my mind?

397
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:00,965
Scott: I look you have a chip and you can send instructions to it to tell it to do things.

398
00:34:01,066 --> 00:34:07,070
Scott: now whether you have Windows or Whether you have Linux you have the same chip in there probably so it understands the same instructions.

399
00:34:07,291 --> 00:34:10,049
Rym: Yeah, if you wrote a program in assembler, it would just run.

400
00:34:10,342 --> 00:34:14,945
Scott: Yep The thing is is there are some instructions that you don't send directly to the chip.

401
00:34:14,965 --> 00:34:19,248
Scott: you send them to the operating system And the operating system then tells the chip what to do.

402
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:20,714
Rym: Yep Now this is basically.

403
00:34:20,734 --> 00:34:26,670
Rym: this is called an API a way to interface with the operating system Which then interfaces with all the hardware?

404
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,870
Scott: So let's say you wrote a game for Windows.

405
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:33,775
Scott: Right and in that game that when you were writing the software for the game You had an instruction.

406
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:39,661
Scott: you told Windows draw a line on the screen Right through the middle of the screen draw a black line.

407
00:34:39,681 --> 00:34:41,549
Scott: All right, and that's part of your game.

408
00:34:42,273 --> 00:34:46,250
Scott: Well, if you try to tell that to Linux Linux goes what the fuck you talking about?

409
00:34:46,438 --> 00:34:50,527
Rym: Yeah Cuz you're because Windows has a way where you say I want to have a line drawn.

410
00:34:50,569 --> 00:34:50,790
Rym: blah.

411
00:34:51,232 --> 00:34:54,065
Rym: You tell Windows draw the line the way you draw lines.

412
00:34:54,127 --> 00:34:54,529
Rym: It'll do it.

413
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:56,335
Rym: So nothing understands that.

414
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:59,405
Rym: but Windows because it makes a call to a function.

415
00:34:59,726 --> 00:35:02,490
Rym: that is in Windows It is a Windows specific thing.

416
00:35:02,891 --> 00:35:09,110
Rym: What wine does is it watches for Windows calls like that and turns them into?

417
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,380
Rym: Linux calls.

418
00:35:10,744 --> 00:35:13,440
Scott: Yeah, so You run a program on Linux.

419
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,586
Scott: That's a Windows program.

420
00:35:14,847 --> 00:35:15,330
Scott: Linux goes.

421
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:16,737
Scott: I don't know what the hell you're asking for.

422
00:35:16,817 --> 00:35:18,546
Scott: most of the time like this doesn't work.

423
00:35:18,606 --> 00:35:18,968
Scott: forget it.

424
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:25,727
Scott: But if you put it inside of wine, so you say wine space solitaire dot exe.

425
00:35:26,611 --> 00:35:32,606
Scott: Whenever solitaire wants to draw a window it tells wine and then wine says alright Linux.

426
00:35:32,706 --> 00:35:34,330
Scott: This is this guy over here.

427
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:37,022
Scott: I'm gonna translate for you what he's saying

428
00:35:37,524 --> 00:35:50,729
Rym: now because you're just Translating instructions and only the instructions that need to be translated and Because wine has been developed over the years to do it in an efficient way This is vastly better than trying to emulate an entire computer

429
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:52,753
Scott: Extremely superior.

430
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:58,450
Rym: It also basically allows you to run a Windows program in Linux as though it were in Windows.

431
00:35:58,654 --> 00:36:00,052
Rym: It doesn't care It doesn't know.

432
00:36:00,072 --> 00:36:06,388
Rym: it just opens in a window like any other program and the calls that need to be sent to a Windows thing Get sent to a Windows thing.

433
00:36:07,312 --> 00:36:11,103
Scott: Now all of the you know, the instructions are what to do.

434
00:36:11,585 --> 00:36:13,490
Scott: when certain instructions come in are in libraries.

435
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:15,500
Scott: You know those DLLs you got all over the place.

436
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:17,390
Rym: Those are called dynamically linked libraries.

437
00:36:17,611 --> 00:36:18,937
Scott: Yeah, that's where what.

438
00:36:18,998 --> 00:36:21,650
Scott: that's where the instructions are all defined and made up and such.

439
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:29,150
Scott: But if you want with wine They have a default set of open source libraries that you can use and they work really well.

440
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:36,050
Rym: A lot of these are reverse engineered or generally mimic functionality from Windows and they've been done very well, but they're not perfect.

441
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:40,526
Scott: They're not perfect all the time, but when they work they work great and seriously.

442
00:36:40,587 --> 00:36:43,179
Rym: in the last year They've come a long freaking.

443
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:44,587
Scott: they've come a long freaking way.

444
00:36:44,607 --> 00:36:44,989
Scott: good crap.

445
00:36:45,511 --> 00:36:50,110
Rym: I mean most of my job at IBM involved developing in wine, so I got some stories.

446
00:36:50,398 --> 00:37:00,238
Scott: Yeah But if you want if you have a copy of Windows you can tell wine to use the actual Libraries from Windows instead.

447
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:07,720
Rym: so go into a Windows install or search on Google and find them Get the DLLs put them in wine and tell wine.

448
00:37:07,981 --> 00:37:10,630
Rym: hey use these actual windows files now.

449
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:22,850
Rym: There are varying levels of legality in terms of this But essentially if you own a legitimate copy of Windows you are generally within your rights to use the DLLs in that way And if you do that wine will work awesomely.

450
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:26,550
Scott: But you're gonna have to put in the effort to tell wine to use all these DLLs now.

451
00:37:26,731 --> 00:37:35,109
Rym: We could do a whole show because I was basically a wine developer and Scott has done a bunch of wine stuff Recently and we could tell you exactly what to do.

452
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:44,810
Rym: But luckily for most of you there are now instructions on to internet that will tell you exactly Type this then this then this then this and this will work in wine.

453
00:37:45,533 --> 00:37:54,016
Scott: The one thing I got to say though whenever I point to anyone to a how-to Especially a Linux how-to with command-line stuff in it You know it wine.

454
00:37:54,077 --> 00:37:56,870
Scott: really you don't need so much command-line stuff these days now.

455
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,066
Rym: It used to need a lot more.

456
00:37:58,147 --> 00:37:58,329
Rym: now.

457
00:37:58,591 --> 00:37:59,577
Rym: I mean it used to be.

458
00:37:59,899 --> 00:38:03,838
Rym: you had to edit this really poorly Thought out text file.

459
00:38:04,099 --> 00:38:05,545
Rym: that didn't make a lot of sense.

460
00:38:05,646 --> 00:38:21,328
Scott: yeah now in Ubuntu You can pretty much do apt-get install wine to install wine And then you can put a program like sol dot exe on your desktop in Ubuntu Which is solitaire double click on it, and it'll run just like if it was Windows.

461
00:38:21,509 --> 00:38:24,960
Rym: yep You really only have to do anything to wine other than install it.

462
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:35,833
Scott: if you're trying to run something complicated like steam Microsoft Office yes, or Photoshop or Internet Explorer Internet Explorer is not as tricky depends Which version you want.

463
00:38:35,933 --> 00:38:36,716
Rym: it used to be.

464
00:38:37,037 --> 00:38:39,064
Rym: good fucking God it used to be.

465
00:38:39,204 --> 00:38:39,927
Scott: it used to be.

466
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:42,484
Rym: even now you got to do Some tricks usually to make I you work.

467
00:38:42,605 --> 00:38:43,069
Scott: it depends.

468
00:38:43,632 --> 00:38:44,415
Scott: there's some all.

469
00:38:44,495 --> 00:38:57,206
Scott: there's some wine based things out there like crossover and Sedaga and Basically what those are is wine plus But they're not free like Sedaga is a special is a company.

470
00:38:57,226 --> 00:39:01,410
Scott: they take wine And they add a bunch of stuff to it so that it can play a bunch of games.

471
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:04,726
Scott: But so you know do you really need it?

472
00:39:04,867 --> 00:39:05,450
Scott: is the question?

473
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:06,534
Scott: I mean I have to.

474
00:39:06,735 --> 00:39:10,370
Scott: yeah you used to really need it because it just didn't work without it nowadays.

475
00:39:10,772 --> 00:39:18,622
Scott: I just got half-life 2 to work in plain old free wine Without any windows DLLs today, and it works now.

476
00:39:18,702 --> 00:39:25,607
Rym: consider this it was about seven months ago That I tried to do the same with an older version of wine, and it just wouldn't work at all.

477
00:39:25,727 --> 00:39:26,410
Rym: it was terrible.

478
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:30,224
Scott: I mean there was the newest version of wine which I'm not even using.

479
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,629
Scott: I'm using two versions ago.

480
00:39:32,251 --> 00:39:34,358
Scott: Just added dual monitor support.

481
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:38,210
Scott: just yeah it you know it's it's a bind.

482
00:39:38,873 --> 00:39:42,290
Scott: Wine is always about a year behind the newest windows and then Vista comes out.

483
00:39:43,011 --> 00:39:46,449
Scott: Vista stuff probably won't work in wine for about a year.

484
00:39:46,952 --> 00:39:54,283
Rym: Yeah, of course I mean the same thing happened with Windows 2000 and XP But luckily well, I guess unluckily wine wasn't that good back then so it didn't matter.

485
00:39:54,303 --> 00:40:00,370
Scott: yeah now wine While I wouldn't depend heavily on wine for a whole mess of applications.

486
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:05,309
Rym: Yeah, at least not unless you have a competent wine guy who can sit there and help you.

487
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:05,490
Rym: yeah

488
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:24,250
Scott: If you've got a lot of Windows applications, and you're not you know trying to replace them with Linux alternatives or open source alternatives You probably should just be using Windows, but if you got one or two Windows applications Wine is a very reasonable and good choice of how to get those things working without having Windows.

489
00:40:24,551 --> 00:40:25,676
Rym: Yeah, and we're not kidding.

490
00:40:25,696 --> 00:40:28,770
Rym: You don't need to know much especially in Ubuntu to make it work.

491
00:40:29,151 --> 00:40:36,689
Scott: Yeah, you basically just type wine space the name of the program that you're trying to run dot exe and you press enter.

492
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:39,550
Rym: yep It'll probably just work without you doing anything.

493
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:48,310
Scott: yeah, the general rule with wine is that a program will either just work or It's gonna be a huge pain in the ass and it's not worth it.

494
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:48,492
Scott: Yeah,

495
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:53,801
Rym: if you don't get it to work with minimal effort It's probably not going to work with any amount of effort

496
00:40:53,841 --> 00:41:04,130
Scott: as unless you start writing code for wine Because the reason something usually doesn't work is because it's trying to tell Windows to do things that they haven't yet implemented in wine.

497
00:41:04,491 --> 00:41:10,604
Scott: So let's say you know you had a game that said draw a line and the guys who develop wine who are writing the wine Software didn't.

498
00:41:10,705 --> 00:41:15,600
Scott: yet You know make the draw line function Then your programs gonna do some weird shit.

499
00:41:15,781 --> 00:41:23,370
Rym: either that or it's when you've got two windows Programs that interact with each other in a not obvious or easy way like now at IBM.

500
00:41:23,611 --> 00:41:37,550
Rym: One of my main jobs was to take this terrible piece of shit old application that was written for like Windows 3 1 and Windows 95 and Make it work in Linux and this program requires the Oracle clients.

501
00:41:38,313 --> 00:41:47,530
Rym: So I had to get the Oracle client for Windows because it wasn't really Possible to make this program interface easily with the Linux version of Oracle, which works great.

502
00:41:48,353 --> 00:41:50,370
Rym: I had to get the Windows version of Oracle to work in wine.

503
00:41:50,772 --> 00:41:52,940
Rym: Then I had to get this application to work in wine.

504
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,310
Rym: Then I had to get them to talk to each other properly.

505
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:56,833
Scott: Not easy.

506
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:59,082
Rym: good fucking God it that was.

507
00:41:59,323 --> 00:42:00,929
Rym: I was paid a lot of money to make that work.

508
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:04,808
Rym: So I'm you're not gonna sit down and do that for free in my spare time.

509
00:42:04,828 --> 00:42:06,274
Scott: now There's good news though.

510
00:42:06,374 --> 00:42:08,842
Scott: And that is the other rule of wine.

511
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:11,110
Scott: Is that if something works in wine?

512
00:42:11,651 --> 00:42:12,557
Scott: There's a good chance.

513
00:42:12,678 --> 00:42:13,966
Scott: It'll work better than it does.

514
00:42:14,046 --> 00:42:17,830
Scott: on Windows I mean, you know, sometimes it's about the same.

515
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:22,510
Scott: I mean my half-life - now that I got it working works about the same as it does in Windows.

516
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:26,489
Scott: But for example, what's a good thing that works a whole lot better?

517
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:31,390
Scott: Half-life one actually works a whole lot better in wine than it does on Windows.

518
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:37,730
Scott: Yes, it's just because the software is written more efficiently than the giant bloated Windows operating system.

519
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:43,516
Rym: I think it has more to do with just the fact that when you have limited system resources Linux as a whole has less overhead.

520
00:42:43,536 --> 00:42:47,790
Scott: Yeah, and the wine is a very thin layer relatively speaking.

521
00:42:47,971 --> 00:42:57,370
Scott: Yeah, so even when you put that thin layer on top of the very efficient Linux kernel It's even it's still more efficient than Windows and all of its blob miss.

522
00:42:57,791 --> 00:43:04,956
Rym: So I guess if you've been thinking about making the switch to Linux and you only use a few Windows applications like Scott said Check out wine.

523
00:43:04,976 --> 00:43:08,490
Rym: see if you can get your stuff to work because that's one more step closer to switch it.

524
00:43:09,194 --> 00:43:10,019
Rym: Don't get us wrong.

525
00:43:10,099 --> 00:43:11,850
Rym: I mean we're computer professionals.

526
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:13,517
Rym: We're not zealots in any direction.

527
00:43:13,999 --> 00:43:16,289
Rym: use whatever operating system makes sense for what you do.

528
00:43:16,832 --> 00:43:24,462
Rym: If you're a Windows developer run Windows if you're an animator or graphic designer And you need all those programs that only run on Macs or Windows.

529
00:43:25,044 --> 00:43:27,759
Rym: use Macs or Windows Yeah, I mean.

530
00:43:27,799 --> 00:43:29,090
Scott: but wine is an option.

531
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:40,988
Scott: it does exist and it's getting better every day and we're just trying to make make sure that people Understand that it's out there and how it works and what it does and if it's good for you Maybe it's good for you.

532
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:44,003
Rym: now the thing is I want to see if we can get iTunes to work in wine.

533
00:43:44,344 --> 00:43:49,002
Scott: people have been trying and There's been mixed results because iTunes is.

534
00:43:49,303 --> 00:43:54,447
Rym: I know I'm one of those people They think the real got a broken iTunes on my Gentoo box.

535
00:43:54,487 --> 00:43:54,889
Rym: right now.

536
00:43:55,331 --> 00:44:08,601
Scott: the real problem with getting iTunes to work in wine is that the only use for iTunes is the iPod support and Getting it to work with a device like a USB peripheral is kind of tricky.

537
00:44:08,802 --> 00:44:10,910
Rym: Actually, usually it's not that tricky at all.

538
00:44:11,091 --> 00:44:11,713
Rym: Yeah, really?

539
00:44:11,954 --> 00:44:16,370
Rym: It really depends on what's going on because in many case look in the config file for wine.

540
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:22,410
Rym: I just know this because I had to make this crap old printer print through the serial ports and wine.

541
00:44:22,731 --> 00:44:31,775
Rym: Oh, you can just say come one will cat out directly and raw to serial port one Mmm, you can do things like that.

542
00:44:31,855 --> 00:44:37,030
Rym: So serial ports parallel parallel ports are more tricky because there are different standards of parallel port.

543
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:38,356
Scott: Well, these are USBs.

544
00:44:38,417 --> 00:44:44,261
Scott: So I don't know and especially since the way Linux is handling USB devices lately.

545
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:47,050
Scott: They keep changing it up with the udev and all that jazz.

546
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:48,114
Rym: So theoretically.

547
00:44:48,154 --> 00:44:51,105
Rym: now I say this with a grain of salt because I've never tried.

548
00:44:51,366 --> 00:44:52,430
Scott: I've never tried it either.

549
00:44:52,772 --> 00:45:03,777
Rym: but when it comes to parallel ports and serial ports You can make wine just talk through the serial port raw or you can send the the input and output Through a program or anywhere you want.

550
00:45:04,078 --> 00:45:07,850
Rym: because wine program programs running in wine are running in Linux.

551
00:45:07,951 --> 00:45:09,729
Rym: They can interact with Linux straight up.

552
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:15,507
Rym: You can pipe the output to places you can send stuff in any way that the program would normally accept.

553
00:45:15,869 --> 00:45:16,009
Scott: Mm-hmm.

554
00:45:16,531 --> 00:45:19,870
Rym: So physical devices are no different, but USB.

555
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:22,690
Rym: I've never actually looked at how wine supports USB.

556
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:29,772
Rym: So I can't say but I'm going to look into that soon because I have an old broken recording bit that I want to work In Linux.

557
00:45:30,254 --> 00:45:31,800
Scott: Oh, yeah, maybe that's a good idea.

558
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,145
Scott: Give me the recorded bit software.

559
00:45:33,165 --> 00:45:34,310
Scott: I'll try to get it to work tonight.

560
00:45:34,471 --> 00:45:35,096
Rym: Yeah, cuz I never.

561
00:45:35,277 --> 00:45:37,090
Rym: I never tried to get that to work in wine.

562
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:40,402
Rym: I've never tried to make USB work and I'll go for give me the CD.

563
00:45:40,423 --> 00:45:42,310
Scott: I'll do it while you're post-productioning the show.

564
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:43,876
Scott: Yeah, I'll go for it.

565
00:45:44,017 --> 00:45:49,765
Rym: We'll see if it goes and of course thus concludes Season one of GeekNights.

566
00:45:50,007 --> 00:45:52,417
Rym: Oh notice It's been a year.

567
00:45:52,578 --> 00:45:55,690
Rym: starting tomorrow is season two of GeekNights.

568
00:45:55,730 --> 00:45:58,480
Rym: We're gonna start over with episode one.

569
00:45:58,981 --> 00:46:00,125
Scott: Holy crap.

570
00:46:00,627 --> 00:46:01,550
Rym: I'm kind of excited.

571
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:03,096
Rym: We've been doing this for a whole year.

572
00:46:03,116 --> 00:46:07,835
Scott: Yeah, of course, we're slightly shit talking because we had all these plans We'd have new music.

573
00:46:07,875 --> 00:46:13,369
Scott: We you know changed the format a little and I rejuvenate the show But we're only gonna do a little bit of that not so much.

574
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:22,021
Rym: Yeah, well part of it was that a lot of people really like our music and though our opening song which we have the blessing Of DJ pretzel 4 really seems to define the show.

575
00:46:22,102 --> 00:46:23,908
Rym: So at least for another year, we're gonna keep it around.

576
00:46:23,928 --> 00:46:25,893
Scott: Mm-hmm That sounds good to me.

577
00:46:26,175 --> 00:46:26,616
Scott: Let's work.

578
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:27,058
Rym: Yep.

579
00:46:27,218 --> 00:46:36,410
Rym: And of course tomorrow to inaugurate season 2 We are going to have for you our very awesome interview with Luke crane the creator of burning wheel.

580
00:46:36,851 --> 00:46:43,455
Scott: Yes in season 2 that is one thing you can expect from GeekNights is that we will have more Interviews and Skype action.

581
00:46:43,475 --> 00:46:47,790
Scott: now, we're not gonna go crazy like other podcasts do because we know that if you're listening to the show.

582
00:46:48,212 --> 00:46:55,730
Scott: Maybe you know, if you're not if you're a new listener, this might not be true, but for our old listeners We know the reason you're probably still listening is good like listening to us talk.

583
00:46:56,272 --> 00:47:01,750
Scott: And I know from listening to a lot of podcasts that when they have interviews every day you kind of go All right.

584
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:14,404
Scott: I listen to the show because the hosts are awesome and I never get to hear them say anything, you know You know cut back the interviews a little bit guys, but we are not gonna go super crazy on the interviews But we will have some more to spice it up the show.

585
00:47:14,424 --> 00:47:18,890
Rym: Yeah starting tomorrow Yeah, we'll be bringing in whenever we need a scientific expert.

586
00:47:19,011 --> 00:47:21,866
Rym: We'll probably just Skype him right in and get him in right then.

587
00:47:21,887 --> 00:47:26,144
Rym: Yep Also, we'd like to have a lot more listener feedback on the show.

588
00:47:26,184 --> 00:47:30,970
Rym: geek back was going well But we figure it'd be better if we really only used audio feedback.

589
00:47:31,412 --> 00:47:35,270
Rym: So if you want to be on the show you have questions you want to talk to us use our audio.

590
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:41,250
Rym: We are much more likely to respond to you on the show if you send us audio as opposed if you send us an email.

591
00:47:41,351 --> 00:47:46,945
Scott: Yes, go to front row crew comm and on the right side of the page You're gonna scroll down and there's a big.

592
00:47:47,025 --> 00:47:51,346
Scott: there's a black Rectangle and it says send me an audio and it's got a little pink thing in it.

593
00:47:51,426 --> 00:47:53,755
Rym: if he can't find it If nothing else think of it.

594
00:47:53,795 --> 00:47:56,324
Rym: this way we get enough email now to where.

595
00:47:56,485 --> 00:48:02,048
Rym: while we read all of it We by far do not have the time to respond to all of it.

596
00:48:02,189 --> 00:48:10,230
Scott: Yeah It's like a lot of times I see an email and I go man I'm gonna reply to that but then I don't and it goes down by gmail and I forget about it.

597
00:48:10,611 --> 00:48:12,258
Scott: I don't put a star next to it or anything.

598
00:48:12,298 --> 00:48:15,510
Rym: So if you send us an audio, that'll really stand out from the pack.

599
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:28,140
