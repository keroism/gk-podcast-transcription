00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,746
Scott: It's Wednesday September 13th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:17,410
Scott: tonight We continue origins week with the story of how we discovered the anons.

3
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,166
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:21,012 --> 00:00:26,948
Scott: Know what I did today at work play DDR play DDR at work, so you actually pulled it off this time.

5
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:28,413
Scott: yep That's what I did.

6
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:39,496
Scott: I installed me a nice step mania on the work laptop and a bunch of songs Pretty much first mix through eighth mix and a whole bunch of the side mixes and oh yeah I got down for about an hour,

7
00:00:39,817 --> 00:00:43,289
Rym: so you didn't do the other thing you've been known to do at work when no one's there.

8
00:00:44,091 --> 00:00:46,088
Scott: No, no, I didn't I've just I just played some DDR.

9
00:00:47,211 --> 00:00:53,435
Scott: I think I'm gonna play DDR for like an hour work every day and to become the master again because I have no longer the Master I don't know.

10
00:00:53,455 --> 00:00:54,580
Rym: you seem to pick it up pretty quick.

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,508
Scott: and Wildwood when we played for three days straight Yeah, I did pick it up when he in Wildwood we play for three days straight.

12
00:01:00,568 --> 00:01:04,547
Scott: however I was not up to my previous level of awesomeness.

13
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:17,110
Scott: You know we're Maniac on everything so we're gonna get back up to that level of awesomeness and hopefully beyond that way when I go to the Wildwood will just be like yeah, Oni mode whatever and I've got all the songs for that.

14
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,989
Scott: I got the max 300s and all that jazz, so I'm gonna go for it.

15
00:01:20,585 --> 00:01:21,151
Rym: Yeah We'll see.

16
00:01:21,192 --> 00:01:27,372
Rym: cuz I know that it took me a good month of solid practice to be able to pass the trick version of all Those max.

17
00:01:27,573 --> 00:01:29,342
Scott: oh yeah, I think an hour every day is plenty.

18
00:01:30,045 --> 00:01:30,990
Scott: an hour five days a week.

19
00:01:31,816 --> 00:01:32,926
Rym: I think you should work on dropout.

20
00:01:32,966 --> 00:01:33,249
Rym: first.

21
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:35,215
Scott: I'm headed there.

22
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:37,365
Scott: I was too busy playing music and going yes.

23
00:01:37,446 --> 00:01:45,567
Rym: Yes, yes See if only the floor in our house wasn't so absolutely flimsy we could play DDR every day.

24
00:01:45,587 --> 00:01:47,487
Scott: Yeah, yeah That's that's what we do.

25
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:52,195
Rym: And you know they used to be an arcade with fourth and fifth mix right here But now there isn't.

26
00:01:52,456 --> 00:01:56,539
Rym: yeah it went out of business about a month before you moved in Awesome.

27
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,250
Rym: I used to play there almost every day.

28
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:03,809
Scott: If only we had known we could have bought their machine and put it in our house at the shaky floor And they would have crashed into the base.

29
00:02:04,272 --> 00:02:05,498
Rym: No, you know we would have done.

30
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:07,909
Rym: We would have put it on the back deck with a canopy over it.

31
00:02:08,612 --> 00:02:10,580
Scott: Yeah, cuz that works so well for our bikes.

32
00:02:11,305 --> 00:02:12,048
Rym: just your bike.

33
00:02:12,148 --> 00:02:12,329
Rym: Yeah.

34
00:02:13,131 --> 00:02:14,515
Rym: Anyway, yeah, you got some news.

35
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,402
Scott: I do indeed.

36
00:02:16,422 --> 00:02:18,670
Scott: I'm gonna appease some underwear perverts.

37
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,743
Scott: I'm gonna give an underwear pervert news sort of an underwear pervert news actually.

38
00:02:22,783 --> 00:02:23,546
Scott: It's about a comic.

39
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:24,890
Rym: I read all right.

40
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:27,478
Scott: There is a comic called runaways.

41
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:28,643
Scott: It is awesome.

42
00:02:28,924 --> 00:02:29,586
Scott: You should read it.

43
00:02:29,767 --> 00:02:32,515
Scott: It's about These kids where they're.

44
00:02:32,555 --> 00:02:36,566
Scott: they discovered that the parents were horrible evil supervillains, so they ran away.

45
00:02:36,587 --> 00:02:39,809
Scott: yeah, and It's cool.

46
00:02:40,131 --> 00:02:49,304
Scott: And it's been written until from issues like up to issue 24 by a man named Brian K Vaughn who has never written a bad comic in his life.

47
00:02:49,384 --> 00:02:52,749
Scott: I pretty much buy every single thing He writes ever and it is awesome.

48
00:02:53,532 --> 00:02:59,347
Scott: But they announced that as of issue 20 issue 24 would be his last issue and everyone went.

49
00:03:00,029 --> 00:03:06,687
Scott: no No They're the guy who was the best writer is writing one last comic.

50
00:03:06,908 --> 00:03:12,784
Scott: no now you know You know people like me and some of our friends.

51
00:03:12,865 --> 00:03:13,870
Scott: You know who also read it.

52
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,698
Scott: we're kind of like a. what do we do now?

53
00:03:15,718 --> 00:03:21,522
Scott: and then they announced the new writer and It didn't excite me as much as I know.

54
00:03:21,563 --> 00:03:22,609
Scott: it excites everyone else.

55
00:03:23,331 --> 00:03:26,700
Scott: But it's that that their Joss Whedon guy is gonna write.

56
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:31,975
Scott: really yeah, really really yeah, really oh really Yes, really see.

57
00:03:32,476 --> 00:03:34,743
Rym: I don't know why you don't like fireflies so much?

58
00:03:35,204 --> 00:03:35,665
Scott: pretty much.

59
00:03:35,786 --> 00:03:37,250
Scott: I've never read the guys comics.

60
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:43,050
Scott: I know he writes that astonishing x-men comic, but I don't like any of his TV shows so much.

61
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:47,504
Scott: So I'll probably buy like issue 25 which is his first issue to see.

62
00:03:47,784 --> 00:03:49,550
Rym: well see it depends because I love Firefly.

63
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:59,870
Rym: it's probably one of my favorite shows ever made, but I really didn't like Buffy and There was one scene in all of angel that was even worth noting.

64
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:03,483
Scott: Yeah, I pretty much have the same opinion of all that stuff.

65
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:04,970
Scott: Is that it's not bad?

66
00:04:05,091 --> 00:04:12,989
Scott: It's not like going to watch a bad like Bono's It's not Manos the hands of fate bad or the head gray digital target bad fucking awesome.

67
00:04:13,089 --> 00:04:17,740
Scott: I know It's not bad like MD guys, but it's just not.

68
00:04:18,402 --> 00:04:20,468
Scott: it doesn't make me feel like yay.

69
00:04:20,507 --> 00:04:21,130
Scott: I want to watch it.

70
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:22,755
Scott: It's just kind of a show yeah, except.

71
00:04:22,815 --> 00:04:25,744
Rym: I've noticed you say that about just about everything.

72
00:04:25,805 --> 00:04:29,037
Scott: yeah, yeah most stuff sucks Including that stuff.

73
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:31,690
Rym: see I don't know how you can be such a crotchety old man.

74
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:33,158
Scott: I'm not a crotchety old man.

75
00:04:33,178 --> 00:04:35,108
Rym: if you complain about everything.

76
00:04:35,128 --> 00:04:35,837
Scott: no I don't.

77
00:04:36,488 --> 00:04:45,090
Rym: well We'll be sitting there watching like Arrested Development And you'll be laughing hysterically and then when we're done watching you'll say that was all right because it was kind of man.

78
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:47,136
Scott: It's an okay show.

79
00:04:47,176 --> 00:04:48,020
Scott: get off my lawn.

80
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,427
Scott: It's a better show than fireflies.

81
00:04:49,447 --> 00:04:50,070
Rym: get off my lot.

82
00:04:51,331 --> 00:04:53,980
Rym: You realize you probably pissed off every single one of our listeners.

83
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,330
Scott: anyway the point is is that this is really twice.

84
00:04:58,171 --> 00:04:59,177
Rym: No, yes, you did.

85
00:04:59,297 --> 00:04:59,840
Scott: What did I say to?

86
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,589
Rym: I said the point is is that?

87
00:05:02,551 --> 00:05:04,500
Rym: Do I have to go back and play it for you?

88
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:05,625
Scott: It's not the point.

89
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:06,569
Rym: that was the point.

90
00:05:08,971 --> 00:05:14,486
Rym: He's a no Killarney in the forums who has pointed out not only every mispronunciation we've had.

91
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:15,088
Scott: yeah, what was that?

92
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:15,710
Scott: what learn?

93
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:16,914
Scott: What's wrong with saying lure?

94
00:05:16,974 --> 00:05:17,858
Scott: It's lure.

95
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:21,513
Rym: He got me for saying asbestos instead of as asbestos.

96
00:05:21,814 --> 00:05:22,316
Scott: no he got.

97
00:05:22,737 --> 00:05:25,527
Scott: the correct pronunciation is asbestos and not as best dose.

98
00:05:25,647 --> 00:05:28,336
Rym: you realize that Most people say it the latter way.

99
00:05:28,356 --> 00:05:31,545
Scott: I say it either way like or sometimes.

100
00:05:31,605 --> 00:05:32,628
Scott: I say lure sometimes.

101
00:05:32,688 --> 00:05:33,150
Scott: I say lure.

102
00:05:34,592 --> 00:05:35,357
Rym: I'm lure.

103
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:37,449
Rym: ruler of planet Omicron Persei.

104
00:05:38,031 --> 00:05:38,292
Scott: There's.

105
00:05:38,452 --> 00:05:44,730
Scott: there's a difference between a pronunciation like that like lure and lure which is sort of a dialect type of thing.

106
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:45,411
Rym: That's the point.

107
00:05:45,451 --> 00:05:48,076
Scott: I tried to make and there's another kind of mispronunciation.

108
00:05:48,117 --> 00:05:52,610
Scott: Which is like the o-taken or As opposed to o-taken.

109
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:58,632
Scott: it's like this you know that is a Mispronunciation whereas lure is like a dialect change you know.

110
00:05:59,113 --> 00:06:02,668
Rym: but in the very least he did get us a couple times when we tried To pronounce the name of that bacteria.

111
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:04,238
Scott: Yeah, well I knew the correct.

112
00:06:04,258 --> 00:06:06,571
Rym: when I see We still said it wrong.

113
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:07,600
Scott: you said it wrong.

114
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,648
Scott: I knew the name of the bacteria.

115
00:06:10,668 --> 00:06:11,532
Rym: all right lure.

116
00:06:11,552 --> 00:06:12,516
Scott: Yeah, it's right.

117
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:13,320
Scott: anyway.

118
00:06:15,162 --> 00:06:31,692
Scott: I think this is gonna be good for this comic either way because even if at the worst case scenario He completely screws up this comic At least the attention from his fame will bring people in to read the comic and they'll go and pick up the awesome 24-plus issues that the guy the good guy wrote.

119
00:06:31,873 --> 00:06:37,652
Rym: I can say with certainty that Kremlin in the forums will buy every comic that has Joss Whedon's name.

120
00:06:37,672 --> 00:06:39,879
Scott: Oh, yeah, he already knows the the score with this.

121
00:06:40,141 --> 00:06:41,919
Scott: You know I was talking about it.

122
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:44,571
Scott: Oh, I was trying to hinted that before but you missed it.

123
00:06:44,932 --> 00:06:46,760
Rym: fancy though because I actually wasn't paying attention.

124
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,880
Rym: I was pulling a Michael Godot, and I was busy reading a computer screen.

125
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,486
Scott: I actually have like the first five this.

126
00:06:51,546 --> 00:06:55,440
Scott: actually the best thing about runway runaways is that they print it in the digest.

127
00:06:55,701 --> 00:06:58,495
Scott: I mean they don't only print it in the digest, but they do so.

128
00:06:58,535 --> 00:07:01,165
Scott: it's like little manga books So it's happy to read.

129
00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:04,094
Scott: if you know you're not into the underwear perverts.

130
00:07:04,254 --> 00:07:04,796
Scott: You can pretend.

131
00:07:04,816 --> 00:07:09,674
Rym: It's a manga in color Alright, so there's this news.

132
00:07:09,735 --> 00:07:10,580
Rym: It's been going around.

133
00:07:10,781 --> 00:07:12,185
Rym: I saw it all over far can?

134
00:07:12,205 --> 00:07:15,982
Rym: people were talking about it on dig and It would have been news by itself.

135
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:20,944
Rym: the headline was IT people are twice as likely to wear heavy metal t-shirts.

136
00:07:21,286 --> 00:07:22,330
Scott: I believe it alright.

137
00:07:22,772 --> 00:07:25,885
Rym: I thought this is gonna be some interesting demographics and everyone's talking about it.

138
00:07:26,187 --> 00:07:26,950
Rym: I'll talk about it, too.

139
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,858
Rym: It'll be my news because I went in.

140
00:07:28,878 --> 00:07:37,910
Rym: they talked about how IT people are more likely to wear Black jeans more likely to have ponytails, and I'm thinking this really kind of describes me, and I'm an IT guy.

141
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,284
Scott: Hey, basically the article said the stereotype is true.

142
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:45,985
Rym: behold alright now That if that was it that would have been it and I would have talked a little bit about.

143
00:07:46,106 --> 00:07:56,040
Rym: you know they talk about things Like yeah, IT people are in the news today people from urban areas more likely to enjoy Hip-hop music, but it had stuff like.

144
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,961
Rym: IT people are more likely than business people to carry both cars both a Maglite and a Leatherman.

145
00:08:02,222 --> 00:08:03,989
Scott: I only reason I'm a Leatherman is because too much money.

146
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:09,770
Rym: I Had a Gerber which is basically the same thing as a Leatherman, but someone at IBM stole it.

147
00:08:10,632 --> 00:08:12,950
Scott: But maybe I'll just shell out and buy one one of these days.

148
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:18,947
Rym: So if any of you from IBM are listening, and you took my Leatherman, I want it back Because I know a lot of you listen.

149
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:22,017
Rym: Actually the thing is all the people who listen.

150
00:08:22,037 --> 00:08:24,970
Rym: I know they didn't steal it yeah because they were actually pretty smart anyway.

151
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:26,368
Rym: Now that would have been it.

152
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:34,309
Rym: But no it appears that no one on the internet actually read this article about IT people having long hair and ponytails and crap.

153
00:08:35,111 --> 00:08:35,753
Rym: Because one.

154
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:43,943
Rym: it was on small business IT world, but it just has a blurb there And it links to intermediate net where the actual article lies now.

155
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,030
Rym: intermediate net looks like a hosting company.

156
00:08:46,251 --> 00:08:47,958
Scott: Intermedia tenant is a hosting company.

157
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:49,345
Scott: why host exchange servers?

158
00:08:49,485 --> 00:08:50,450
Rym: host exchange server now?

159
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,583
Scott: Why would a hosting company put a news story on its website?

160
00:08:53,703 --> 00:08:54,527
Scott: that makes no sense.

161
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:54,728
Scott: now

162
00:08:54,788 --> 00:09:07,890
Rym: even better It seems like a lot of the articles of small business IT world are like this They look like an article and the blurb looks like an article But if you follow it it goes to some company's bullshit website that has some bullshit article on it that starts out.

163
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,921
Rym: I mean this article starts out.

164
00:09:08,962 --> 00:09:09,670
Rym: given all these facts.

165
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:14,086
Rym: I people type people do this and IT people do that and business people do this and that.

166
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:15,250
Rym: and here's some data.

167
00:09:15,974 --> 00:09:18,890
Scott: But intermingled sounds like a stand-up comedy routine.

168
00:09:18,971 --> 00:09:29,748
Scott: That's all racist like white man Dude, it's a black man do that and a Spanish guy do this but intermingled and all that are all of these little bits like blah blah blah blah blah.

169
00:09:30,231 --> 00:09:33,222
Rym: intermediate nets gold certified Microsoft blah blah blah.

170
00:09:33,242 --> 00:09:35,510
Rym: team was comforted by the news blah blah or.

171
00:09:36,192 --> 00:09:43,209
Rym: Many people are implementing Microsoft Exchange hosted environments blah blah blah and it's nice to know their customer demographics.

172
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:48,569
Rym: and If you haven't figured out by now, the article is complete horseshit.

173
00:09:48,932 --> 00:09:59,007
Rym: It is nothing more than a classic marketing ploy where the company takes some sort of news that they know the people they want to target would be interested in and They make up news about it.

174
00:09:59,411 --> 00:10:05,510
Rym: Then the news is actually just effectively a press release or ad copy about their company.

175
00:10:06,531 --> 00:10:09,781
Scott: You think that the hackers would be able to recognize the Trojan horse by now.

176
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:17,783
Rym: then they submit it to some other site like small Business IT world and then they submit it on that site to somewhere like dig.

177
00:10:18,064 --> 00:10:26,096
Rym: or maybe rollin pig Paley's blog Or maybe he's some here Gupta.

178
00:10:26,658 --> 00:10:30,850
Scott: ah summer Gupta probably my favorite we should do an episode on some mere good.

179
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,569
Rym: We could have Samir Gupta week.

180
00:10:33,774 --> 00:10:36,203
Rym: All right, it's an aside.

181
00:10:36,685 --> 00:10:38,050
Scott: if you don't don't it takes too long.

182
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:44,996
Rym: I'm gonna say is if you want to know ahead of time Google around for a man named Samir Gupta spelled the way you'd Think an Indian man's name Sam.

183
00:10:45,096 --> 00:10:45,900
Scott: I are Gupta.

184
00:10:46,141 --> 00:10:48,470
Scott: Yes, GU PTA Samir Gupta.

185
00:10:48,912 --> 00:10:50,057
Rym: We have things to say about him.

186
00:10:50,197 --> 00:10:56,501
Rym: we do indeed, but this is such a classic Obvious marketing ploy and the thing is this particular one isn't even done.

187
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:57,063
Rym: Well at all.

188
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,869
Rym: It's so obvious if you read the article.

189
00:10:59,912 --> 00:11:05,650
Rym: But from what I can gather no one read the article and everyone's talking about this like it's actually news.

190
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,349
Scott: News stereotype is true.

191
00:11:08,631 --> 00:11:15,210
Scott: No news companies are putting articles on their websites that are actually ads and then getting people to link to them.

192
00:11:15,631 --> 00:11:30,965
Rym: so I implore all of you if you see someone talking about this news about how IT people wear heavy metal shirts as Awesome as that idea may be Hit them and tell them that they're wrong and that this is just some company's scam to trick people into using Microsoft Exchange through them,

193
00:11:31,188 --> 00:11:46,860
Scott: you know I actually kind of blame Google because the thing is with Google is most people you search the internet with Google and you only show up in a high rank on Google if a lot of people link to you and in addition to that if you have a high rank on Google.

194
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,646
Scott: that's gonna result in a lot of money.

195
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:53,930
Scott: if you're a company because You're gonna get a lot of people visiting So no one's gonna link to just a hosting company.

196
00:11:54,051 --> 00:11:56,946
Scott: I mean, what reason do they have to link to the hosting company's website?

197
00:11:57,087 --> 00:11:57,469
Scott: Not much.

198
00:11:58,212 --> 00:12:10,409
Scott: So companies that normally would just put up a website for themselves are now putting things on their website like fake articles that are actually Ads and such in order to get links to those things to get their own Google rank up.

199
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:18,950
Rym: You know the sad thing is our Google rank at least for the forums on from recruit comm is Crazy insane and we haven't done anything.

200
00:12:19,331 --> 00:12:25,390
Scott: Well can see the thing is all that search engine optimization stuff is pretty much like hey if you do this You Google rank will go up.

201
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,008
Scott: Hey, if you do this your Google rank will go up.

202
00:12:27,652 --> 00:12:33,010
Scott: But the thing is if you actually look at the most, you know modern search engine optimization things.

203
00:12:33,713 --> 00:12:41,065
Scott: All of them involve making your bullshit spam site You know seem to the Google bot like it's more legitimate.

204
00:12:41,466 --> 00:12:49,990
Scott: if you're just legitimate You don't have to do anything because the Google bot is built to recognize and respect and pump up legitimate good websites.

205
00:12:50,151 --> 00:12:54,089
Scott: So if you run a good legitimate website, your Google rank is gonna get pumped up.

206
00:12:54,503 --> 00:13:02,349
Rym: Yeah And as a result if you search in all caps for one flew over the cuckoo's nest essay You will find the front row crew forums on the first page.

207
00:13:03,213 --> 00:13:12,284
Scott: The point is you only need search engine optimization if you have a bullshit spam Fake trying to make a lot of money website and you want your Google rank to go up.

208
00:13:12,405 --> 00:13:16,410
Scott: because if you just make one Of those kind of websites Google will shut you down the hole.

209
00:13:16,711 --> 00:13:24,579
Rym: So the moral here is simply if you want a hosted Microsoft Exchange environment Don't go to intermediate net.

210
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:28,010
Scott: no buy a computer and buy a copy of Microsoft Exchange.

211
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:30,190
Scott: And if you're smart, you won't use Microsoft Exchange.

212
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:33,001
Scott: We get like open exchange or something for free and just install it.

213
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:47,281
Rym: The problem is for most corporate environments I hate to say it but exchange is usually for what they need the best solution because the other solutions either cost more in admitting or They end up being something like Lotus Notes.

214
00:13:47,301 --> 00:13:49,568
Scott: or have you looked at open exchange lately?

215
00:13:49,749 --> 00:13:50,210
Rym: No, I haven't.

216
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:54,124
Scott: It's actually pretty much it does the same thing as exchange with open source stuff.

217
00:13:54,184 --> 00:13:55,930
Rym: It's been over a year since I looked at that.

218
00:13:56,051 --> 00:13:57,366
Scott: Yeah, it's actually pretty awesome.

219
00:13:58,072 --> 00:14:02,070
Scott: Thing is it's it's not feasible for a company already stuck with exchange to go to it.

220
00:14:02,411 --> 00:14:06,190
Scott: But if you start a new company don't buy exchange use the open exchange.

221
00:14:06,632 --> 00:14:07,054
Rym: You know what.

222
00:14:07,456 --> 00:14:10,450
Rym: use Google mail for domains, that's also a good idea.

223
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,175
Rym: So on to the main bit.

224
00:14:18,195 --> 00:14:26,010
Rym: we're going to continue origins week talking about how we got into Anime since there have been a lot of threads in the forums lately about you know, what was your first anime?

225
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:26,874
Rym: How'd you get into it?

226
00:14:26,935 --> 00:14:29,250
Rym: And considering we chose this theme for the week?

227
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,337
Rym: It seems that we will go right along with this topic.

228
00:14:31,979 --> 00:14:35,839
Rym: We've also got a special guest Emily who is back from a long stint in Japan.

229
00:14:36,003 --> 00:14:41,621
Rym: yo I'm sure in the few and sometime in the near future We're going to get her on the show to talk about her experiences.

230
00:14:41,641 --> 00:14:43,230
Emily: I want to talk about the big three.

231
00:14:43,391 --> 00:14:45,063
Emily: I really want to talk about the big three.

232
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:49,929
Emily: Yeah, big three What the big three summer anime movies that I went and saw in the theater?

233
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:58,369
Emily: So, yeah lots of news and that I figured that was the one thing I could lord over these two because it was.

234
00:14:58,429 --> 00:14:59,174
Emily: it was Kind of funny.

235
00:14:59,618 --> 00:15:06,290
Emily: like a while back in the forums I brought up the idea of recording segments and I actually did use my little you know

236
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:07,812
Rym: Headphone

237
00:15:07,892 --> 00:15:23,530
Emily: micro or headset microphone to record some little I don't know five minutes or so and They really didn't turn out that great not just because of microphone quality But just listening to me kind of rambling by myself and then putting that in the midst of the Scott.

238
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:25,948
Rym: Oh, we've we've learned that lesson.

239
00:15:25,988 --> 00:15:31,010
Rym: I mean Did you hear the episodes where Scott was by himself or where I was by myself?

240
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:35,090
Emily: We couldn't do it and I just paused for a really long time and have to cut out these.

241
00:15:35,812 --> 00:15:40,829
Rym: Yeah, when I did my first episode by myself, it took me an hour to record 20 minutes.

242
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:48,050
Emily: Yeah, so so it's tougher than it looks and I give these guys credit for maintaining the energy they do every day of the frickin week.

243
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,576
Scott: So let's.

244
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:52,327
Scott: it's just hard to do it with one person if it's two people.

245
00:15:52,387 --> 00:15:52,889
Scott: It's like we.

246
00:15:55,112 --> 00:16:05,220
Rym: It becomes more conversation than a talking to myself in the middle of my you know studio plus there's a lot less incentive to Wait a minute, I could just re-edit myself and make myself sound perfect.

247
00:16:05,943 --> 00:16:07,829
Rym: I got to keep editing because I never sound perfect on.

248
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:15,175
Emily: Oh, yeah, but so anyway The the biggest thing was that I I figured you know, I'm in Japan.

249
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:20,054
Emily: I can be this Japan correspondent But the thing is they'd they'd figure out stuff before.

250
00:16:20,134 --> 00:16:21,540
Emily: I did you know with the internet?

251
00:16:21,961 --> 00:16:22,384
Rym: What was it?

252
00:16:22,445 --> 00:16:24,140
Rym: that cup noodle thing up noodle thing?

253
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:28,586
Emily: I I go downstairs to the lobby where I got my Wi-Fi cover in mind.

254
00:16:28,626 --> 00:16:38,075
Emily: she's in Japan where all of this comes from and so I I see I'm like What could I talk about that Rym and Scott wouldn't know about through like dig and gadget or whatever.

255
00:16:38,736 --> 00:16:45,700
Emily: and I go downstairs And on the TV this amazing commercial comes on for cup noodles, you know, it's it's anime.

256
00:16:46,081 --> 00:16:48,812
Emily: It's you know 3d cell shader, which is beautiful.

257
00:16:48,892 --> 00:16:49,816
Emily: Looks like Akita.

258
00:16:49,836 --> 00:16:56,758
Emily: It's it's great and I go up and I really excited and I record this bit and I call Rym on Skype.

259
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:57,320
Emily: I'm like for him.

260
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:12,386
Emily: I have this thing It's and then I listen to the podcast and it was like the podcast that day was like, yeah cup noodle freedom Scott's like I have this thing.

261
00:17:12,445 --> 00:17:14,494
Emily: I'm like he's not gonna say it is he.

262
00:17:14,536 --> 00:17:17,400
Emily: and then he's like, yeah The Akita guy did a commercial.

263
00:17:18,462 --> 00:17:22,895
Emily: No, no, how could they possibly know about Japanese commercials before I do?

264
00:17:22,955 --> 00:17:24,339
Emily: I can understand like technology.

265
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:38,320
Scott: Well, the trick is you know, since Japan is the the place of awesome anything that's significantly awesome Like escapes Japan and comes here, you know See the trick is is that if you're there you can collect all the stuff that is just slightly less awesome.

266
00:17:38,381 --> 00:17:45,425
Scott: That doesn't make it out Like it's stuck there and you got to kind of scoop it all up so that you know people outside go There's the stuff we're missing.

267
00:17:45,466 --> 00:17:51,631
Emily: that's the thing like all the all the stuff you can get at like convenience stores Like the little Gundam candy and stuff like that.

268
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:52,876
Scott: That's not just physical things.

269
00:17:52,956 --> 00:18:00,249
Scott: It's like, you know information or you know other things like that like oh there's something that all the Japanese people know.

270
00:18:00,369 --> 00:18:07,296
Scott: or through the grapevine kind of yeah, or You know, here's the thing that Japanese people have access to that Americans don't.

271
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:15,858
Rym: seems like the only barrier We have left is the language barrier because like there's the Mario manga that no one's translating I would pay large amounts of money to read that.

272
00:18:16,018 --> 00:18:19,079
Scott: Yeah I have volume one for a dollar.

273
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,807
Emily: You know, where's the Mario manga?

274
00:18:22,848 --> 00:18:24,433
Emily: and we we found it at book off.

275
00:18:24,573 --> 00:18:26,500
Scott: Yep next to the Kirby manga.

276
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:35,472
Rym: But anyway, it's since we wanted to talk about origin stories I guess we'll begin with Scott because he is the crotchets member of the.

277
00:18:35,633 --> 00:18:35,934
Scott: what's it?

278
00:18:35,954 --> 00:18:37,018
Scott: the tragedy lately?

279
00:18:37,098 --> 00:18:39,608
Scott: first Versus the sedentary lifestyle.

280
00:18:39,668 --> 00:18:41,957
Scott: now, it's the crotchety old man next to Scott.

281
00:18:41,977 --> 00:18:44,106
Emily: You're so dead Scott.

282
00:18:44,147 --> 00:18:45,634
Scott: yeah, the corpse Scott.

283
00:18:45,654 --> 00:18:46,859
Scott: He's just dead dead.

284
00:18:46,899 --> 00:18:50,556
Rym: yet You're just an old man keeping kids off your lawn with your sedentary lifestyle.

285
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:54,188
Rym: Yeah Anyway, so how'd you get an anime Scott?

286
00:18:54,750 --> 00:19:04,502
Scott: Well, you know like most kids a little kid I'm watching me some Voltron and watching me some transformers and Thundercats and not realizing this Japanese I'm like this.

287
00:19:04,522 --> 00:19:30,100
Scott: just cartoons is what kids watch, you know, and then I think It had to be some time like late middle school early high school ish When I realized that there was a thing called anime that existed that were there were cartoons from Japan that were somehow different You know than the ones from America And you know, I knew about them and I think like there's a big deal when sci-fi was gonna show Akira because

288
00:19:31,188 --> 00:19:32,683
Rym: You know Well,

289
00:19:33,024 --> 00:19:39,720
Scott: it was all mature and stuff and like I did I kind of like watch like five minutes of it And then I went to bed at that point.

290
00:19:40,503 --> 00:19:50,060
Scott: But eventually I think I don't know remember exactly when it was but you know I was watching, you know Thundercats and stuff on Toonami when multiar was the host in high school.

291
00:19:50,241 --> 00:19:51,977
Rym: You mean the best era of Toonami?

292
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:57,117
Scott: Yes Good area of Toonami when they still had Space Ghost and Hercule Oids in the middle.

293
00:19:57,137 --> 00:20:01,497
Scott: and you know There was Dragon Ball and Sailor Moon and stuff on there, but I wasn't watching that.

294
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,644
Scott: but you know The anime was coming in, you know Sneaking in there.

295
00:20:05,547 --> 00:20:08,158
Scott: and then sci-fi channel had a week of Godzilla movies.

296
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,860
Scott: now I already like Godzilla movies.

297
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:14,468
Scott: So I watched all of them especially the best Godzilla movie Which is Godzilla versus Mothra.

298
00:20:14,689 --> 00:20:17,785
Scott: and anyone who wants to argue with me on that Head to the forums.

299
00:20:17,826 --> 00:20:18,710
Scott: cuz Godzilla verse.

300
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,439
Scott: Mothra is the best Godzilla movie ever.

301
00:20:20,861 --> 00:20:22,507
Rym: Well Mothra is the best monster ever.

302
00:20:22,527 --> 00:20:23,571
Scott: therefore no shit.

303
00:20:23,792 --> 00:20:26,160
Scott: The second best movie is Mothra.

304
00:20:28,285 --> 00:20:28,710
Scott: Take that.

305
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:35,846
Scott: so anyway I was watching that and during that because it was a whole week of Godzilla movies You know, they had ads like.

306
00:20:35,926 --> 00:20:40,389
Scott: next week is all anime movies and I'm like, okay Maybe I'll stick around and watch that.

307
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,880
Rym: So what movies did they show?

308
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:52,165
Scott: I remember seeing a Fatal Fury because you know It's that Neo Geo fighting game with the guy with the hat and I watched it and not having seen many anime movies before It was okay.

309
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:54,620
Scott: I mean, hey, I probably wouldn't watch it now.

310
00:20:55,702 --> 00:21:01,520
Scott: But I remember one scene where there was a huge fight in a giant Neo Geo arcade with arcade machines flying everywhere.

311
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,364
Scott: It's pretty awesome.

312
00:21:02,485 --> 00:21:04,817
Scott: God, and then they showed.

313
00:21:04,837 --> 00:21:07,520
Scott: eventually I think they showed the sequel and some other movies.

314
00:21:07,942 --> 00:21:14,889
Scott: But the only movie that I remember or care about was the first two Galaxy Express 3 9 movies Which were and still are awesome.

315
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,475
Rym: Yeah, we watched them again recently.

316
00:21:16,515 --> 00:21:17,800
Scott: In fact, the old the first one.

317
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,906
Scott: We don't watch the second one again.

318
00:21:19,107 --> 00:21:21,559
Scott: Well, I want to anyway, we should real soon have it.

319
00:21:21,761 --> 00:21:24,260
Rym: So see I guess I got into the game a bit earlier than you.

320
00:21:24,381 --> 00:21:26,432
Rym: I remember very very specifically.

321
00:21:26,472 --> 00:21:27,860
Rym: I posted in the forums a bit about it.

322
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,834
Rym: But my mother and she has said this to me many times in my life.

323
00:21:32,215 --> 00:21:33,500
Rym: There's gonna be something on TV.

324
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,331
Rym: That's a lot like those Castlevania games.

325
00:21:35,371 --> 00:21:36,458
Rym: You like watch it.

326
00:21:37,282 --> 00:21:45,500
Rym: She said that about the never-ending story and she said that about this thing this cartoon thing That was gonna be on the sci-fi channel when I was in fourth grade.

327
00:21:46,062 --> 00:21:53,055
Rym: So I sat down some Saturday and sure enough I catch the last Two thirds of vampire hunter D. Mmm.

328
00:21:53,075 --> 00:21:54,240
Rym: to my fourth grade mind.

329
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,605
Rym: That was the most awesome thing ever.

330
00:21:55,966 --> 00:22:00,000
Rym: D was the coolest person I'd ever seen depicted in television.

331
00:22:00,242 --> 00:22:11,880
Scott: Yeah after I saw that Galaxy Express I was trying to watch the Saturday morning anime on sci-fi as much as I could but it got canceled and they kept changing the Time around and I tried to dress up as D for like three Halloween's afterward.

332
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:16,020
Rym: But my parents always talked me out of it saying that no one would know what I was and they think I was weird.

333
00:22:16,181 --> 00:22:18,579
Scott: You just gotta have the mouth in the hand and everyone will know what you are.

334
00:22:19,115 --> 00:22:31,048
Emily: I Remember when I dressed up, um, my dad but when he went on a business trip, he bought a VHS of Princess Mononoke.

335
00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:33,858
Emily: that was like my favorite movie when I was in.

336
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:36,489
Emily: let's see I must have been in like ninth grade or something.

337
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:37,273
Emily: Oh, wow.

338
00:22:37,373 --> 00:22:38,016
Emily: Yeah, it was.

339
00:22:38,116 --> 00:22:38,960
Emily: it was a long time ago.

340
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,179
Emily: it was even before it came over to the US and we had like this raw VHS and I loved it.

341
00:22:43,199 --> 00:22:49,520
Emily: and Um, so I dressed up as son and the only person who figured out what I was.

342
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:55,440
Emily: Everybody else thought I was a cave girl and they were like the exchange student from Japan was like, oh my god.

343
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,660
Emily: So that was kind of satisfying but nobody got it.

344
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,200
Scott: I remember I discovered Princess Mononoke cuz I went to F. between high school and college.

345
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,515
Scott: I went to Israel and while we were there there was this guy named Ruben like.

346
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,520
Scott: his first name is Ruben.

347
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:14,320
Scott: My last name is Ruben, but he spells his first name differently.

348
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:23,477
Scott: Anyway, he was there and on the trip with us and he was talking about this movie Princess Mononoke I'm like, I never heard of this movie, you know, and Ian was not.

349
00:23:23,497 --> 00:23:25,868
Scott: that's where I met Ian And he was all into Gundams and stuff.

350
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:28,040
Rym: You may remember Ian from the epic smells.

351
00:23:28,301 --> 00:23:31,680
Scott: Yes, he was from the epic smells story that Ian and he was just a Gundam nut.

352
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,840
Scott: He still is a Gundam nut, but you know, he was just ranting about Gundam.

353
00:23:35,001 --> 00:23:42,220
Scott: So that's how we got into the anime discussion and then like you're passing by a movie theater in Israel And there was a poster for Princess Mononoke.

354
00:23:42,482 --> 00:23:47,020
Scott: We didn't watch it because we you know We couldn't just stay around and watch a movie in the middle of some trip.

355
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,607
Scott: But no there it was.

356
00:23:48,869 --> 00:23:52,364
Scott: and then when I got back to the US I was like, aha There we go.

357
00:23:52,847 --> 00:23:55,498
Scott: And then the anime club started like two months after that.

358
00:23:55,558 --> 00:24:07,315
Rym: So yep See after vampire hunter D I was hooked and I stayed all day and I watched like project a co and dominion tank police Robot carnival, which was the only one I didn't like an eight-man after.

359
00:24:07,335 --> 00:24:12,152
Rym: and then years later I saw the Tenchi Muyo movie and I got obsessed and I bought the entire OAV.

360
00:24:12,172 --> 00:24:19,898
Rym: and then through high school every Sunday We'd buy like two or three tapes of anime and then we'd watch them all between our two sessions of D&D.

361
00:24:21,184 --> 00:24:24,518
Rym: And I pretty much was an anime nut from fourth grade until now and I'm still an anime nut.

362
00:24:25,322 --> 00:24:30,880
Rym: Mmm, the RIT anime club did nothing except give me more access to anime because I already rented everything in blockbuster.

363
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:36,293
Scott: Yeah, I remember our blockbuster had some stuff, but I couldn't really it wasn't enough.

364
00:24:36,514 --> 00:24:38,420
Emily: Oh, oh, I have a blockbuster story.

365
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:41,350
Emily: I'm sure they've told you about video barn, right?

366
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,758
Emily: That was like the hangout of all the RIT kids.

367
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:44,320
Emily: They go there.

368
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:54,506
Emily: It's just a no-name video star with just a ton of foreign films and anime like all these cult hits all these like Really really obscure pretty much every movie ever.

369
00:24:54,887 --> 00:24:56,793
Emily: It's it's actually quite impressive.

370
00:24:56,853 --> 00:25:03,778
Rym: It's no Kim's no Kim's but it's it's pretty much single-handedly got us into Asian kung-fu action flicks.

371
00:25:05,211 --> 00:25:16,597
Emily: When I was in high school I used to beg my mom to take me to the blockbuster across the street from video barn Even though it was like half an hour away Because it had like 20 anime.

372
00:25:30,604 --> 00:25:37,731
Scott: Usually the no-name video places have crap these days, you know Yeah, but like video barn is one of those rare ones.

373
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:40,020
Scott: That's like this one per state that has everything.

374
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,700
Rym: Well, the thing was the guy who ran it knew a lot about this stuff.

375
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:47,959
Rym: I mean, he wrote things like very good sword fighting on the front of movies that had very good sword fighting.

376
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:53,016
Scott: Yeah We went to the video barn and we were like, do you have attacked the gas station?

377
00:25:53,036 --> 00:25:54,140
Scott: He just pulls it right out.

378
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,678
Scott: It's right there and I'm like she.

379
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,180
Rym: You know, you could tell he was just really into it.

380
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:02,048
Rym: You like to tack the gas station.

381
00:26:02,068 --> 00:26:13,347
Rym: they also had a real big porn section in the bag with the creepy way like the ritual of getting porn where they had like these drop boxes and you pick because we saw him and I asked the guy what they were.

382
00:26:13,911 --> 00:26:15,120
Rym: I asked the guy what the deal was.

383
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:19,740
Rym: He was like that's so people can buy porn without looking like they're buying porn or renting porn.

384
00:26:20,343 --> 00:26:23,660
Rym: You would pick out all the porn you want and put it in a cubbyhole in the bag.

385
00:26:24,021 --> 00:26:36,000
Rym: then you walk out with nothing in your hands, then you've read something normal and when you go to check up you say and Number four and then the guy would just discreetly take all the stuff from QB number four and put it in a brown paper bag.

386
00:26:36,365 --> 00:26:37,138
Rym: It's clever.

387
00:26:38,143 --> 00:26:39,637
Rym: He also had parking around back.

388
00:26:42,181 --> 00:26:46,340
Rym: Sad thing is I'll bet he made more money off of that porn than he did off of all those Asian kung-fu movies.

389
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:48,347
Scott: Yeah, well, they also had every anime ever.

390
00:26:48,969 --> 00:26:52,380
Emily: Yeah, pretty much they had like a hentai section.

391
00:26:52,501 --> 00:26:54,340
Emily: You could see it wasn't like in the porn corner.

392
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:59,020
Emily: It's like you were walking down the aisle like they literally had an anime aisle and you're walking down the aisle.

393
00:26:59,181 --> 00:27:00,365
Emily: It's like normal normal normal.

394
00:27:00,505 --> 00:27:01,589
Emily: Oh my god, scary

395
00:27:01,609 --> 00:27:03,676
Scott: titles and then the door to the

396
00:27:03,757 --> 00:27:13,839
Emily: sex taxi I haven't heard of that one Title start getting kind of surreal and I'm like

397
00:27:15,961 --> 00:27:22,476
Rym: I always hear people talk about like Oh Genki clinic or cool devices or my lady innocent or another

398
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:22,857
Scott: lady.

399
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:36,338
Scott: Well, I always hear about For men or I keep hearing like Bible black and discipline I don't know.

400
00:27:37,142 --> 00:27:41,237
Emily: Actually the the video store in Leeroy had basically no anime.

401
00:27:41,397 --> 00:27:44,627
Emily: princess Mononoke I think I had Magic Knight rareth who.

402
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:48,259
Emily: the anime I did have was like ancient like Unico and stuff.

403
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:49,946
Rym: Wow It seemed like where I grew up.

404
00:27:49,966 --> 00:27:55,216
Emily: Maybe that's why Kate new Unico and nice to go Don't know.

405
00:27:56,381 --> 00:28:00,639
Scott: She's doing it right as she listens to this, you know, you realize you probably you've primed a cake grenade.

406
00:28:02,027 --> 00:28:05,528
Emily: When you come up Sneak up behind Scott for me.

407
00:28:05,808 --> 00:28:09,340
Rym: Yeah, I think I'll try to record this horrible shriek that our friend cake.

408
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:21,238
Rym: Anyway, the the video stores near me all had the same anime because I went far and wide when I was like middle school with my parents and everyone from head like Demon City Shinjuku and Harmageddon.

409
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:28,922
Rym: Aris line was If the last episodes get crummy The thing is.

410
00:28:28,962 --> 00:28:37,468
Rym: the weirdest thing was all these stores had like three random tapes of Evangelion But they all had the three same random tapes.

411
00:28:37,488 --> 00:28:38,651
Rym: It wasn't like tape.

412
00:28:38,772 --> 00:28:44,184
Rym: one two and three was table like one four and seven And I thought it was.

413
00:28:44,486 --> 00:28:45,871
Rym: I mean I saw it and I looked at.

414
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:48,020
Rym: I was like that's some religious show isn't it?

415
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:56,720
Scott: Yeah, it was weird like I didn't even realize just how many anime things you could buy in the US.

416
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,436
Scott: I figured that you know, like you just couldn't get that stuff here.

417
00:28:59,476 --> 00:29:05,743
Scott: and then like the first Yeah, I know but I mean like the first year at RIT was like this way crazy Transition.

418
00:29:05,763 --> 00:29:17,399
Scott: because I came into RIT that first year at the beginning of the year, you know It was like here the old VHS's that we're watching from the anime club library and at the end of the year We're buying DVDs and downloading fans up.

419
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:17,941
Scott: It's like that.

420
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:25,588
Rym: all that stuff happened in that one number of two thousand while we were freshmen at RIT was when digital fans Subs suddenly exploded.

421
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,260
Scott: Yeah, it's the year 2000. all that stuff came to me.

422
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:40,220
Rym: It was when and I remember specifically because I almost got kicked out of the RIT anime club by the tape Nazi Greg Young Because the eska flown a movie had come out and it was the pretty much the first widely distributed digital fan sub.

423
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:42,920
Rym: And I found it and I oh my god.

424
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:53,267
Rym: So I made like a ten copies of it and I was given to people like check this out It's the eska flown a movie and the anime club was like that's bootlegging We're gonna kick you out of club.

425
00:29:53,287 --> 00:29:56,360
Rym: and then the next year the club was showing fan subs.

426
00:29:57,321 --> 00:29:58,384
Scott: Well, they were doing it that year.

427
00:29:58,404 --> 00:29:59,968
Scott: They had gatekeepers the first one.

428
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:14,136
Emily: I remember living in Japan that I think it was 2002 when I was checking the RIT's Watching stuff that I couldn't watch because it was on too late.

429
00:30:14,417 --> 00:30:30,659
Emily: and you know everybody was bit torrenting by this time and bit torrent got really popular like 2002 and I just remember checking the website and being like what's it watching that that hasn't even come out on video yet You know, I can't even rent it from Sataya mad, you know

430
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,943
Rym: but I mean it's.

431
00:30:32,485 --> 00:30:42,936
Rym: I love the fact that my anime fandom went from seeing horrible dubs on the sci-fi channel to Literally watching shows the day after they're aired in Japan translated into English.

432
00:30:43,237 --> 00:30:50,680
Rym: Yeah So I think Emily here has probably the most extensive and earliest history in anime compared to the two of us.

433
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:59,273
Emily: It was kind of weird because it's basically opposite of everyone that I know Because everyone's like my parents don't understand my hobby.

434
00:30:59,374 --> 00:31:01,160
Rym: I had no freaking idea what this stuff was.

435
00:31:01,441 --> 00:31:03,148
Scott: You know, my parents kind of get it.

436
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:12,520
Scott: I mean they go to the movie theater when there's a Ghibli movie out, you know Yeah, it's fine they kind of get it, you know, they're not like they don't really get it but you know, they're down.

437
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:18,056
Emily: Yeah Well, I got into honey me because of my parents and actually my extended family.

438
00:31:18,096 --> 00:31:32,592
Emily: the first manga I ever got was gotten by my uncle Dave who was he's a Comic book artist slash graphic designer lived in Chicago and he got me the Harlock Actually as an Ani manga, but it was all in Japanese.

439
00:31:32,693 --> 00:31:37,260
Emily: is I had no idea what's going on That there were Nazis and planes and aliens with blues.

440
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:51,714
Emily: But um, I remember specifically like my parents have always been really into foreign films and indie films in particular and they were shopping in the foreign film section of media play.

441
00:31:51,935 --> 00:31:52,939
Emily: may it rest in peace.

442
00:31:52,959 --> 00:32:01,080
Emily: and They came across like a very small shelf and half of it was like kind of suspicious looking porny things.

443
00:32:01,521 --> 00:32:24,008
Emily: But they're like Japanese animation and I remember them talking about a title they thought was funny was all-purpose cultural cat girl nukunuku, and they thought that was a funny title for a. But they picked up Oh my goddess and you're under arrest cuz they're like, this is the stuff Dave was talking about and it might be kind of cool But we don't know if it's scary cuz.

444
00:32:24,048 --> 00:32:34,941
Emily: like so much of that stuff looked kind of kind of sketchy Like everyone who didn't know what anime was like a small shelf and half of it was just like porn porn porn I think.

445
00:32:34,961 --> 00:32:39,057
Scott: what it was back in the day when the sci-fi channel first started picking up all this anime is.

446
00:32:39,097 --> 00:32:41,284
Scott: they were like Check out anime.

447
00:32:41,385 --> 00:32:46,319
Scott: It's this ultraviolet ultra hardcore wicked for adult animation stuff.

448
00:32:47,823 --> 00:32:52,584
Rym: They showed like vampire hunter D, but then they showed like erosa yatsura - yeah But it's like.

449
00:32:52,624 --> 00:32:53,851
Scott: that was what the ads were.

450
00:32:53,891 --> 00:32:55,320
Scott: That was how they were marketing it.

451
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,247
Scott: You know, they they pushed Akira like.

452
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:59,616
Scott: this is something kids shouldn't see but it's a cartoon.

453
00:32:59,716 --> 00:33:00,600
Scott: Oh my god.

454
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:05,715
Emily: That's from the past when I was hanging out with the a Ken the movie club when I was at Nagoya.

455
00:33:05,735 --> 00:33:09,646
Emily: I Opened a box and it broke.

456
00:33:10,068 --> 00:33:16,780
Emily: and guess what was inside like a whole stack of really really old erosa yatsura Manga, I love that manga.

457
00:33:17,144 --> 00:33:18,317
Emily: It was so funny to read it.

458
00:33:18,911 --> 00:33:25,920
Rym: in fact My friend Ken had like all of it in this giant stack of like these huge books that the binding would break pretty much immediately.

459
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:34,880
Rym: His manga was really rare when I was a kid Like in Japanese, so it was in English because that stuff was translated mad early.

460
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:37,895
Emily: Yeah, I think we have the same volume you're talking about.

461
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:38,880
Emily: That's like huge.

462
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:47,159
Rym: It's like an inch and a half thick and the whole bunch of stories from it They like took out the only the best store, you know, he was bitching about that and I didn't even know.

463
00:33:48,262 --> 00:33:50,528
Rym: All I could think was how does he know stuff's missing?

464
00:33:50,909 --> 00:34:00,940
Emily: Yeah, I noticed and that's also like when they released Maison Ikoku I realized like a few years ago that they cut chapters out of it and I was like, why'd they do that?

465
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,246
Rym: Well, it's weird where I grew up.

466
00:34:02,286 --> 00:34:04,255
Rym: I mean other people I've talked to.

467
00:34:04,295 --> 00:34:13,920
Rym: there was a lot more Anime in the stores and in the video rental places in my area than in most areas You know when I was in fourth grade, but there was zero manga.

468
00:34:14,222 --> 00:34:16,580
Rym: There was absolutely no manga anywhere.

469
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:21,620
Rym: But one time I went to Florida to March with my marching band in like the Citrus Bowl or something.

470
00:34:21,962 --> 00:34:24,600
Rym: Yeah, and we we ended up on the last day.

471
00:34:24,741 --> 00:34:29,545
Rym: Our chaperone was supposed to take us to the hard rock cafe and then wait for our plane But our plane was late at night.

472
00:34:29,565 --> 00:34:30,206
Rym: So we had all day.

473
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:35,109
Rym: our chaperone said I'll pretend you were with me all day Don't get killed.

474
00:34:35,472 --> 00:34:42,380
Rym: and he wandered off On a trip like my friend Dan and my friend Ken went down like downtown.

475
00:34:42,561 --> 00:34:43,042
Scott: we're adults.

476
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:51,911
Rym: now every trip is like that and we found this virgin mega store and we wandered in and they had a Manga or as we said a manga said god.

477
00:34:52,194 --> 00:34:53,539
Emily: God everyone does that.

478
00:34:54,063 --> 00:35:01,332
Rym: Yeah, and I remember I was in awe Absolute awe and I bought as much as I could afford to buy.

479
00:35:01,352 --> 00:35:09,880
Rym: I spent all my money buying tenji muyo manga And I read it all it like the plane trip to Chicago, but anyway.

480
00:35:11,482 --> 00:35:13,660
Emily: So I started out with oh my god.

481
00:35:13,826 --> 00:35:19,858
Emily: actually even before then we were really into Ghibli movies because my mom had rented my neighbor Totoro.

482
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:32,249
Emily: and Even before my dad started going to Japan on business trips and for a while like when I was in sixth grade we thought we were like the whole family was going to get transferred over to Japan and It didn't actually come to pass.

483
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:35,180
Emily: but my dad still goes back for business fairly frequently.

484
00:35:35,361 --> 00:35:48,879
Emily: so that's how I got like my neighbor Totoro and Majo no takibin and stuff like that and he also brought back like the raw Mononoke, which was like basically sealed my anime fandom forever.

485
00:35:48,899 --> 00:35:58,400
Emily: and as far as manga is concerned they Also bought most of my manga like my dad really likes.

486
00:35:58,661 --> 00:36:07,514
Emily: He's funny because my mom tends to go more for as far as comics go She really likes the American indie stuff more like those biography kind of.

487
00:36:08,116 --> 00:36:13,120
Rym: I just find it so cool that your parents I mean my parents I remember her buying daredevil comics.

488
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:18,280
Rym: They couldn't understand what this anime thing was or what this manga stuff was.

489
00:36:18,803 --> 00:36:24,633
Rym: My mom was convinced that the comics were just boobies Mainly because I had Tenchi Muyo, which had a lot of yeah.

490
00:36:24,874 --> 00:36:35,400
Rym: Yeah, but in the anime I remember my mom was watching beautiful dreamer while I was watching and she was doing housework and at the end She looks at me and she says wasn't this about Nazis in the beginning?

491
00:36:37,063 --> 00:36:37,245
Rym: Where?

492
00:36:37,306 --> 00:36:38,439
Rym: what's going on with this show?

493
00:36:39,521 --> 00:36:42,041
Scott: Yeah, my parents are never really into anything Like.

494
00:36:42,122 --> 00:36:46,820
Scott: I think my mom bought like an X-Files comic book once like we were just in the comic book store.

495
00:36:46,901 --> 00:36:51,330
Scott: She saw it and she went ooh, and she bought it, you know Like whatever I want.

496
00:36:51,390 --> 00:37:00,330
Scott: if I like, you know, comic books then that you know That's what we'd go get if I have a video games and we go do that too, you know, whatever geeky thing I wanted they were like, okay whether they understood it or not

497
00:37:00,471 --> 00:37:07,680
Rym: at least to my mom's credit when I one time I was 16 and I wanted a copy of dragon half because that show is fucking hilarious.

498
00:37:08,481 --> 00:37:11,775
Rym: Good God, if you haven't seen dragon half go find it dragon half.

499
00:37:11,795 --> 00:37:12,879
Scott: We got to talk about that sometimes.

500
00:37:14,369 --> 00:37:23,420
Rym: Yes If nothing else look on YouTube or Google video for the closing theme.

501
00:37:23,702 --> 00:37:25,757
Rym: In fact, that'll leave my thing of the day in the future.

502
00:37:25,777 --> 00:37:26,220
Rym: awesome.

503
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:34,618
Rym: so never mind, but the thing is it had a for adults only sticker on it because there's a Short nude scene in the very end of it.

504
00:37:35,485 --> 00:37:36,252
Scott: So scandal.

505
00:37:36,373 --> 00:37:37,240
Scott: so I got boobies.

506
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:44,955
Rym: So I went to media play and I tried to buy it and they were like you can't buy this you're 16 And I was like what I have a mustache.

507
00:37:45,197 --> 00:37:45,820
Rym: I'm not 16.

508
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:49,060
Rym: They're like, let me see some ID and like oh and I left you should have fake ID.

509
00:37:49,260 --> 00:38:02,870
Rym: So I went to my mom and I said mom buy me this show called dragon half and she goes she's like, alright She's even questioned why I'm asking her to buy this for me and she goes and she comes back with a bag and she says They said this is only for adults.

510
00:38:03,372 --> 00:38:04,759
Rym: What did you ask me to buy?

511
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:11,054
Scott: but at the same time It'd have been like you should have said watch it with me and you'll say I did.

512
00:38:11,235 --> 00:38:12,691
Rym: and at the end she said that was weird.

513
00:38:13,903 --> 00:38:20,840
Rym: Meanwhile my dad totally different story He used to sit there and watch Sailor Moon with me, which he thought it was just kind of weird and girly.

514
00:38:21,241 --> 00:38:29,396
Rym: but then one day I was watching the tenchi muyo if he's the original ryokio AV and My dad was watching it and he like he walked into the room.

515
00:38:29,437 --> 00:38:33,196
Rym: He was doing something He saw it on and he started watching and then he kept watching.

516
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:40,420
Rym: then he just sat down He watched the whole OAV with me and at the end He just looks and says that was really kind of funny and not what I expected at all.

517
00:38:40,761 --> 00:38:41,988
Rym: And since then I've been giving.

518
00:38:42,048 --> 00:38:43,817
Rym: he likes cowboy bebop and he really likes.

519
00:38:43,837 --> 00:38:44,460
Rym: read or die.

520
00:38:45,042 --> 00:38:50,039
Emily: See cowboy bebop is is like the best transitional anime to get Americans hooked.

521
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:50,440
Emily: totally.

522
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:56,001
Emily: I think it's like your friends say anime sucks and you show them bebop and then they're like, it's weird though Like.

523
00:38:56,041 --> 00:39:00,979
Scott: I have discovered a few people recently who are like, I don't like it and I'm like what the hell's wrong with you.

524
00:39:03,623 --> 00:39:10,079
Rym: Most of the people who at least know about anime and don't like how we bebop are all mod like new fans.

525
00:39:10,561 --> 00:39:12,357
Rym: well, I guess haven't seen a lot of anime yet.

526
00:39:12,377 --> 00:39:16,610
Emily: or They see like shows anything that hasn't come out yesterday.

527
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:19,900
Rym: They hate yep, or any show that isn't a thousand episodes.

528
00:39:20,081 --> 00:39:31,133
Rym: I saw some fanboys complaining in a forum about how Those old shows are only like 20 episodes long Actually really good and high-budget shows now.

529
00:39:31,153 --> 00:39:38,820
Rym: They they still limit their yeah Mm-hmm, cuz you can't tell me these kids are like in a yasha went on for a thousand episodes.

530
00:39:40,201 --> 00:39:42,876
Scott: So a thousand episodes of crap versus 26 awesome.

531
00:39:46,841 --> 00:39:48,651
Rym: Yep, I mean everyone always forgets that.

532
00:39:48,691 --> 00:39:50,119
Rym: two of the greatest anime ever.

533
00:39:50,684 --> 00:39:50,947
Rym: Thank you.

534
00:39:50,967 --> 00:40:04,688
Rym: No eska flown a and Evangelion we're both supposed to be 39 episodes and they ran out of money and they had to cut them down to 26 Which made Eva kind of incomprehensible, but on the same Wait a lot of philosophical discussion.

535
00:40:04,748 --> 00:40:12,900
Rym: Are you claiming that Ava would have been comprehensible somehow if they've been able to add more bullshit to it If they had if they'd had twice as many scenes of Shinji going.

536
00:40:23,905 --> 00:40:29,320
Scott: Dave and Joel's They had the best thing when they were talking about Shinji.

537
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:38,918
Scott: They were like if someone comes up to you and says, you know, you had to pilot the giant robot like the only two answers are like, you know, like Okay, when?

538
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,214
Scott: Or like I'm already in let's go.

539
00:40:42,841 --> 00:40:43,626
Scott: Something like it was.

540
00:40:43,706 --> 00:40:45,255
Scott: it was much more funny when they said it.

541
00:40:45,536 --> 00:40:48,590
Rym: but yeah We can't really rip them off like anime world order does.

542
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:51,140
Scott: no no, but it was quite hilarious.

543
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,631
Scott: I was laughing for like five minutes.

544
00:40:52,691 --> 00:40:56,447
Scott: I had to rewind their podcast actually the best.

545
00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:04,437
Emily: like I said, my parents are Part of the reason I got into film in the first place, but they they picked out bebop.

546
00:41:04,477 --> 00:41:05,380
Emily: They picked out Lane.

547
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,287
Emily: you know most of the stuff.

548
00:41:07,348 --> 00:41:14,657
Emily: my mom would read reviews and stuff online and She she'd pick out these shows and they were always the best shows.

549
00:41:14,797 --> 00:41:20,435
Emily: So Gay to my parents my dad Into mezani koku and yotsuba.

550
00:41:20,616 --> 00:41:21,058
Emily: Those are like.

551
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:24,356
Rym: well Yotsuba is not human.

552
00:41:24,477 --> 00:41:27,385
Rym: Yeah That's what I told the library.

553
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:34,227
Rym: even our friend Brian who like seems to really dislike all anime manga He's just like vehemently against it.

554
00:41:34,327 --> 00:41:36,253
Rym: But yet but yet yotsuba.

555
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,416
Rym: He goes nuts over.

556
00:41:37,517 --> 00:41:38,600
Rym: He just it's too good.

557
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,585
Scott: How can you know?

558
00:41:39,967 --> 00:41:44,226
Scott: I mean there are underwear perverts scary guys I know that, you know, they don't.

559
00:41:44,307 --> 00:41:46,454
Emily: the whole underwear pervert you didn't do.

560
00:41:46,494 --> 00:41:49,869
Scott: we've not explained this like ten times You didn't okay.

561
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,197
Emily: We're talking about the.

562
00:41:51,298 --> 00:41:57,980
Rym: the comic Problem is we did a show where we did a show where we talked about this as a news.

563
00:41:59,887 --> 00:42:06,135
Rym: Well, the problem is that it was common news But then it disappeared off the internet like it wasn't widely linked to and it was basically.

564
00:42:06,175 --> 00:42:14,659
Scott: it was news in the 70s But everyone forgot it until recently and Marvel and DC have trademarked the words superhero and super - hero.

565
00:42:15,461 --> 00:42:16,003
Scott: I don't forget.

566
00:42:16,023 --> 00:42:20,200
Rym: I forget which company has which word but technically we can't really use those words in that context.

567
00:42:20,941 --> 00:42:24,372
Scott: So no, so boing boing said they've discovered this recently.

568
00:42:24,432 --> 00:42:28,168
Scott: so boing boing said fine, we're not calling it superhero anymore We're calling it underwear pervert.

569
00:42:28,309 --> 00:42:29,820
Scott: So we're just going along with that.

570
00:42:29,941 --> 00:42:31,899
Scott: Yeah, and that's what that is.

571
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,340
Rym: But since we don't want to go too long in the episode one thing I find interesting.

572
00:42:35,764 --> 00:42:37,560
Rym: I always like to you know categorize things like this.

573
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:43,930
Rym: But it seems like all of us here despite the fact that we all got into anime over You know a span of many years at different times.

574
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:46,680
Rym: We're definitely I would call a second gen anime fans.

575
00:42:47,282 --> 00:42:51,858
Rym: In terms of that zeroth gen is like the people who watch star blazers in the 70s.

576
00:42:52,400 --> 00:43:00,681
Scott: Yeah the people who watch Robotech knew that it was Japanese knew that they destroyed three Japanese shows to make it and they were copying tapes at conventions back in The day.

577
00:43:00,701 --> 00:43:03,811
Rym: and zeroth gen I think even includes the people before VHS.

578
00:43:04,172 --> 00:43:06,620
Scott: Wow, they were copying beta tapes at conventions.

579
00:43:06,741 --> 00:43:08,179
Rym: No, they were copying nothing.

580
00:43:09,702 --> 00:43:11,007
Rym: But then like they stole

581
00:43:11,028 --> 00:43:13,940
Scott: some film and they were watching it in a projector at a convention

582
00:43:14,062 --> 00:43:17,240
Rym: Yeah, like these are the oldest of school Before there was downloading

583
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:21,398
Scott: Translations from the internet on paper and looking down and at them and then up at the screen

584
00:43:21,619 --> 00:43:25,147
Rym: Scott Downloading from the internet.

585
00:43:25,488 --> 00:43:33,171
Rym: No, they were getting them on paper in the mail Long long time ago and I was.

586
00:43:33,272 --> 00:43:47,760
Emily: I might have been in elementary school but we I must have been in seventh grade because we had AOL and we downloaded like a Watch a couple of shows with scripts and you know what it really sucks.

587
00:43:47,981 --> 00:43:51,815
Scott: Yeah, but then first generation you've been using gen locks to add subtitles.

588
00:43:51,836 --> 00:43:53,000
Rym: Don't get me started on gen locks.

589
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,752
Rym: I really wanted to learn about that technology until I realized that it really saw.

590
00:43:56,772 --> 00:43:57,675
Scott: now it's obsolete.

591
00:43:57,915 --> 00:44:05,480
Rym: Thank you God, but There's the first generation fans and those are basically the people who are running all of the anime conventions today.

592
00:44:06,063 --> 00:44:15,260
Rym: I mean if you listen to anime world order, they're pretty much the Trailing end of the first generation fans just as we are the bleeding edge of the second generation fans.

593
00:44:16,143 --> 00:44:18,171
Rym: Third gen are the kids coming up now watching.

594
00:44:18,231 --> 00:44:28,520
Scott: I don't know Naruto bleach Z Yep Man, I actually just remembered something that back in the day like the early 90s and I went to the comic book store.

595
00:44:28,661 --> 00:44:37,520
Scott: They had like a one little tiny shelf that had Ranma and Dragon Ball Z tapes And they had a little tiny TV that would show them and I remember I would look at it for like a minute and go.

596
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,133
Scott: I don't like that.

597
00:44:39,461 --> 00:44:43,960
Scott: That kind of like I did and I don't think they they might have had some manga on that shelf, but I don't remember it.

598
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,688
Emily: Well third gen fans.

599
00:44:45,768 --> 00:44:53,800
Emily: I always thought are people who take one Anime on television for granted like they don't remember a time where there hasn't been constant anime?

600
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:59,155
Rym: Yeah, or even better that the travesties like when Fox tried to do eskaflowne.

601
00:44:59,175 --> 00:45:03,899
Emily: or they grow up with the internet You know, they don't remember ever having say a dial-up.

602
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:09,700
Scott: Well, it's like these kids where the PlayStation was their first system and Final Fantasy 7 was the first Final Fantasy they ever played.

603
00:45:09,801 --> 00:45:10,967
Scott: It was like what's what the hell?

604
00:45:11,148 --> 00:45:18,016
Rym: but then again, there's the first gen fans who were like Yeah, you kids suck because we had to go through a lot of difficult effort to get our fandom.

605
00:45:18,056 --> 00:45:18,819
Rym: you kids just get.

606
00:45:18,859 --> 00:45:20,747
Scott: that's like We're awesome because we're right in between.

607
00:45:20,807 --> 00:45:23,660
Scott: we're not the crazy guys and we're not the young punk kids.

608
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:24,885
Scott: We're the in-between awesomes.

609
00:45:25,367 --> 00:45:27,094
Scott: No one will ever be as awesome as we are.

610
00:45:27,114 --> 00:45:28,460
Scott: We're better than everybody.

611
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,108
Rym: I think we're just the crazy punk guys.

612
00:45:30,148 --> 00:45:31,534
Scott: Yeah, the people older than us suck.

613
00:45:31,554 --> 00:45:32,660
Scott: the people younger than us suck.

614
00:45:33,001 --> 00:45:35,869
Rym: The problem is that's what everyone thinks I know isn't it great?

615
00:45:36,311 --> 00:45:39,220
Rym: except the punk kids the third-gen fans don't even know we exist.

616
00:45:39,642 --> 00:45:40,868
Rym: Yeah, they don't even notice us.

617
00:45:40,888 --> 00:45:43,380
Rym: They probably think that we're like someone's parents when we go to the con.

618
00:45:44,261 --> 00:45:47,137
Emily: It's like they don't remember a time when it wasn't mainstream.

619
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:51,093
Rym: yet I think back and I can't remember a time when I wasn't playing Nintendo games.

620
00:45:51,535 --> 00:45:52,358
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

621
00:45:52,418 --> 00:45:52,840
Scott: That's true.

622
00:45:53,061 --> 00:45:55,355
Emily: Well, it came out like the year after I was born.

623
00:45:55,375 --> 00:46:02,887
Rym: So yeah Anyway, okay This up Yeah, you want to feel old.

624
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:04,472
Scott: you're young we're the old ones.

625
00:46:04,833 --> 00:46:05,716
Rym: no, you know who's old?

626
00:46:06,036 --> 00:46:10,312
Scott: our friend Scott Johnson and the World when you and your dad brought home that modern.

627
00:46:10,372 --> 00:46:10,855
Scott: Okay tape.

628
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:11,940
Scott: I was like done with high school.

629
00:46:15,344 --> 00:46:20,180
Rym: Okay, yeah, luckily a lot of our listeners are a lot older than us which makes me feel a lot better about myself.

630
00:46:21,644 --> 00:46:26,580
Rym: Okay, once again, that was our very hastily put together origin story of anime.

631
00:46:27,264 --> 00:46:34,617
Rym: Once again tomorrow being Thursday where we can talk about anything We have a very special topic that we're not going to reveal just yet because they didn't think of it yet.

632
00:46:34,778 --> 00:46:35,240
Rym: quiet you.

633
00:46:36,181 --> 00:46:37,649
Rym: It's supposed to be some sort of mystery.

634
00:46:38,011 --> 00:46:39,097
Scott: It is a mystery to me.

635
00:46:39,318 --> 00:46:42,877
Rym: tomorrow We're gonna talk about something that we got into and how we got into it.

636
00:46:43,158 --> 00:46:50,598
Rym: Awesome It might just be like how we got into the cupboard or how we got into I don't know.

637
00:46:51,882 --> 00:46:53,140
Emily: Heap of hot water.

638
00:46:53,643 --> 00:46:56,320
Rym: Yeah, yeah, but to end with a couple quick meta bits.

639
00:46:56,901 --> 00:47:10,520
Rym: Um, if you have been for whatever reason not joining the front row crew GeekNights for a little boogers Yes, you are full of boogers But if you blow your nose, there is no reason not to join the GeekNights.

640
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:11,243
Rym: What are you doing?

641
00:47:11,544 --> 00:47:15,460
Rym: are growing to the point that we can barely contain their awesomeness?

642
00:47:16,202 --> 00:47:19,259
Rym: Their people are posting there faster than I can read.

643
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:22,592
Scott: Yeah, I used to like respond to all these threads all the time.

644
00:47:22,652 --> 00:47:23,455
Scott: now I just can't.

645
00:47:23,536 --> 00:47:29,040
Rym: it's just not possible And I'm starting to see a couple of some people who don't really even listen to GeekNights that much.

646
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,593
Rym: They just really like our forums.

647
00:47:30,915 --> 00:47:35,460
Scott: Yeah Also, I want to pimp the long neglected frapper map.

648
00:47:35,782 --> 00:47:42,460
Scott: If you go to a front row crew calm and on the right side There's a little icon II thing that says add yourself to the frapper map.

649
00:47:43,022 --> 00:47:46,520
Scott: So go do that and there'll be little push pins for all our listeners on there.

650
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:52,240
Emily: I was so sad because I wanted to be the first person in Japan and there were already like three people.

651
00:47:52,422 --> 00:47:53,680
Emily: No, there was one person.

652
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:05,134
Scott: They're actually like three or four legitimate people over there.

653
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:12,409
Rym: now hello, Japan Is an American who's teaching English there?

654
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:14,718
Rym: Yeah, we also have.

655
00:48:14,819 --> 00:48:15,160
Rym: it's funny.

656
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:19,200
Rym: We have a lot of listeners in Australia and Britain and we have a Dutch listener.

657
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,770
Scott: There was the guy from Hong Kong.

658
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:22,340
Scott: Yeah, and there was a guy from New Zealand.

659
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:25,694
Rym: I think we're more popular overseas than we are in the US.

660
00:48:26,156 --> 00:48:28,974
Rym: No, I don't think so But it's at least like 60/40 at this point.

661
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:31,465
Scott: It's like 70/30, but it's still.

662
00:48:31,506 --> 00:48:35,458
Scott: it's still a lot of international goings-on Ray for you learning English.

663
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,380
Scott: Yes Sorry, we don't know your languages except for Emily.

664
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:43,080
Rym: Anyway, since they were descending into chaos join the forums join the frapper map go to the website.

665
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:46,120
Rym: You get links to all the things we talk about like the wonderful things of the day.

00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:55,543
Rym: There's a good chance.

669
00:48:55,583 --> 00:49:00,823
Rym: We're going to be finally actually interviewing Jim Vowles the con chair of Otakon 2006.

670
00:49:00,823 --> 00:49:03,899
Rym: We interviewed him in the forums text wise which you can read that there.

671
00:49:04,481 --> 00:49:09,120
Rym: But if you have questions, you would like to ask the con chair of Otakon ask away.

672
