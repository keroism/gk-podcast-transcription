1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,710
Rym: It's Thursday June 1st, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:18,240
Rym: We were originally we're going to talk about the airline industry, but we got sidetracked by chemistry and bullies and all sorts of fun stuff.

3
00:00:19,211 --> 00:00:20,227
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:21,072 --> 00:00:27,790
Rym: So it's about a thousand degrees and the humidity is about a billion here right now, but it rained, but it didn't matter.

5
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:32,000
Rym: Yeah, it rained and the humidity got worse because the rain kind of fell and then stuck around.

6
00:00:33,172 --> 00:00:37,316
Scott: So it's it's like the air couldn't hold any more water But there was.

7
00:00:37,477 --> 00:00:39,290
Scott: it was so hot that water was evaporating.

8
00:00:40,612 --> 00:00:43,249
Scott: Then it wanted to go where there was no room for it.

9
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:51,682
Scott: So it rained to make room for new humidity that immediately Filled the vacant area where the rain used to be.

10
00:00:51,703 --> 00:00:59,850
Rym: I was walking around downstairs And there's a time you can feel the water everywhere in the carpet on the walls and all the furniture.

11
00:01:01,131 --> 00:01:03,078
Scott: We need to get us a fan down there.

12
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,327
Rym: Yeah, you know what I'm gonna stay up here in my airtight air-conditioned room.

13
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:13,486
Scott: I'm going to stay upstairs in my airtight air-conditioned room though this weekend.

14
00:01:13,526 --> 00:01:20,662
Rym: We will be at the beach unless the weather is Terrible if it's terrible if I go anyway.

15
00:01:21,325 --> 00:01:22,570
Scott: Yeah, we won't go to the beach.

16
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:23,613
Scott: We'll go to the.

17
00:01:23,734 --> 00:01:24,597
Rym: we'll go to the shore.

18
00:01:24,757 --> 00:01:25,078
Rym: Yes.

19
00:01:25,179 --> 00:01:27,466
Rym: We'll look at the beach from the from the house.

20
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:38,144
Rym: Yeah him probably play some games in other news because we've done long episodes for most of the week and Because it's late and we're tired and we're going out of town tomorrow.

21
00:01:38,185 --> 00:01:39,510
Rym: This won't be the longest episode.

22
00:01:40,054 --> 00:01:40,921
Scott: No, it won't be.

23
00:01:41,062 --> 00:01:42,793
Scott: it'll be quite Terse.

24
00:01:43,234 --> 00:01:50,354
Rym: if you wanted a long episode try listening to yesterday or the day before which were both very long At least long for us.

25
00:01:50,896 --> 00:01:51,116
Rym: Yeah.

26
00:01:51,197 --> 00:01:55,430
Rym: Well, I've noticed that the length of our episodes has been creeping upward ever slowly.

27
00:01:55,692 --> 00:01:57,369
Scott: Well, let's try to put a cap on that.

28
00:01:58,213 --> 00:02:01,625
Rym: Yeah, I mean originally it when we first started doing this it was tough to get.

29
00:02:01,665 --> 00:02:04,109
Rym: make it out to the 45 minutes We'd always kind of shot for.

30
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,155
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

31
00:02:06,235 --> 00:02:11,029
Scott: Well, you know practice and then Actually having something to talk about.

32
00:02:11,451 --> 00:02:18,088
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know when we can't think of something to talk about and we pick some crap-ass topic for the day It doesn't go very long.

33
00:02:18,451 --> 00:02:22,470
Rym: Yeah, except that we've gotten good at talking about those crap-ass topics because we've done it so often.

34
00:02:22,832 --> 00:02:26,410
Scott: Yeah, but when we talk about a real good dog, it goes even longer.

35
00:02:26,972 --> 00:02:29,139
Rym: Yeah, I mean I could have gone another couple hours on.

36
00:02:29,179 --> 00:02:30,524
Rym: an amazement great.

37
00:02:31,266 --> 00:02:33,814
Scott: I don't think anyone's dared They seem to.

38
00:02:33,974 --> 00:02:36,002
Rym: everyone seems to like to hear everything we have to say.

39
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:44,685
Scott: we might as well just sit here going Like exactly that and then I guess people will enjoy it.

40
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:45,910
Rym: yep top top dilly done.

41
00:02:47,091 --> 00:02:48,094
Scott: You got a problem.

42
00:02:49,197 --> 00:02:50,160
Rym: I like that music.

43
00:02:50,401 --> 00:02:51,083
Scott: you got a problem.

44
00:02:51,564 --> 00:02:56,329
Rym: I think I'm just gonna order the two CDs I found because I can't find them torrent wise anywhere.

45
00:02:57,272 --> 00:03:00,070
Scott: Well, you're not gonna find them on Pirates Bay at least not for a couple days.

46
00:03:00,432 --> 00:03:01,621
Rym: Yeah, that is that.

47
00:03:01,641 --> 00:03:02,306
Rym: that's not really news.

48
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:08,269
Rym: But for anyone who's following it the Pirates Bay people have stated openly that they will be back up within a few days.

49
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:10,478
Scott: woohoo, those are my kind of people.

50
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:17,227
Rym: they have also claimed that it is all a result of corruption and money and influence from foreign countries.

51
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:25,092
Rym: a They're claiming that the search was illegal and unwarranted and they're going they may possibly sue for a violation of whatever rights they have in Sweden.

52
00:03:25,736 --> 00:03:27,849
Scott: yeah, I don't know how Sweden court works though.

53
00:03:28,352 --> 00:03:31,230
Scott: Usually a lot of those European courts have the professional judges.

54
00:03:31,991 --> 00:03:32,873
Scott: So it's tricky.

55
00:03:33,293 --> 00:03:37,340
Rym: so if any of you out there in Sweden and know anything about Swedish law give us a buzz.

56
00:03:39,256 --> 00:03:43,606
Scott: I know about the Swedish law yeah.

57
00:03:46,175 --> 00:03:47,187
Rym: So you have any actual news?

58
00:03:50,391 --> 00:03:50,812
Scott: Let's see.

59
00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:55,746
Scott: oh we're going to wizard word Philly Saturday, so if you want to see us.

60
00:03:56,168 --> 00:03:56,669
Scott: We'll be there.

61
00:03:58,191 --> 00:04:04,944
Rym: If you happen to be in Wildwood, New Jersey Saturday night and Sunday Let us know before we leave and maybe we'll see you on the beach.

62
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:11,119
Scott: Yep Half-life 2 episode 1 came out today.

63
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:12,202
Scott: I'm playing it.

64
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:13,164
Scott: It's worth.

65
00:04:13,606 --> 00:04:15,049
Rym: He's playing it to the exclusion of life.

66
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,221
Rym: He basically locked himself in his room all day.

67
00:04:17,241 --> 00:04:18,910
Scott: I don't got anything else to do.

68
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,039
Scott: I mean, what would I done if I wasn't playing it?

69
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:21,882
Rym: I don't know.

70
00:04:21,942 --> 00:04:25,395
Scott: read a book go outside Do I do any of those things?

71
00:04:25,495 --> 00:04:29,570
Rym: usually you pretty much just sit in front your computer anyway, so it's a difference.

72
00:04:29,711 --> 00:04:31,769
Scott: I'm just running a different piece of software this time.

73
00:04:32,551 --> 00:04:33,395
Rym: I don't know how you can do it.

74
00:04:33,455 --> 00:04:36,569
Rym: I get sick of sitting in front of my computer after you know several hours.

75
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:42,099
Scott: Hey, as long as there's something to do on the computer There's an infinite number of things to do.

76
00:04:42,481 --> 00:04:44,410
Rym: you could never run out of things to do on a computer.

77
00:04:44,673 --> 00:04:45,870
Scott: Then why are you questioning?

78
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:51,859
Scott: I don't know how you could be so sit in front of it for so long And then immediately you answer your own question.

79
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,390
Rym: well because I find most of the things you can do useless.

80
00:04:55,334 --> 00:04:56,308
Scott: Well, I don't do those things.

81
00:04:56,852 --> 00:04:59,283
Rym: I mean I've gotten to the point where I don't even really surf the web anymore.

82
00:04:59,303 --> 00:05:03,950
Rym: now that I have a job where I actually Work as opposed to a job where I can mostly just kind of surf the web.

83
00:05:05,031 --> 00:05:06,739
Rym: I don't surf the web at all in my free time.

84
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:09,050
Scott: Yeah, I got to get one of those jobs there.

85
00:05:09,452 --> 00:05:18,570
Rym: I only look at the internet like once when I come home from work for a little bit And then right before I do the show and then if someone's online I'll chat with them for a little bit, and then I'll go to sleep.

86
00:05:19,393 --> 00:05:21,078
Scott: I just mostly only visit.

87
00:05:21,219 --> 00:05:26,655
Scott: you know this list of websites that I have feeds for and You know that's.

88
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:29,170
Scott: I just get information from those sites.

89
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,090
Scott: I don't go browsing around for new stuff all the time actually hardly ever.

90
00:05:33,372 --> 00:05:35,189
Rym: But you do seem to go to those sites a lot.

91
00:05:35,892 --> 00:05:38,982
Scott: I go to them maybe five six times a day because they update.

92
00:05:39,023 --> 00:05:41,190
Scott: you know the ones that only update once a day.

93
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,144
Scott: I read once a day, and you know like penny arcade.

94
00:05:44,184 --> 00:05:45,088
Scott: I'll go once a day.

95
00:05:45,108 --> 00:05:48,384
Rym: realize I only check FARC once a day now that.

96
00:05:48,827 --> 00:05:49,410
Rym: if that?

97
00:05:51,252 --> 00:05:52,782
Scott: Yeah, no, but I'll go to dig.

98
00:05:52,842 --> 00:05:54,813
Scott: maybe like I mean I guess six times

99
00:05:54,874 --> 00:06:05,865
Rym: poking around on the internet looking for news is fine and all if I have nothing better to do because you Know I was at work where I couldn't really do anything else Mm-hmm, but surfing the internet is pretty much at the bottom of my list over everything else.

100
00:06:05,905 --> 00:06:07,109
Rym: I could be doing with my free time.

101
00:06:08,671 --> 00:06:13,064
Scott: Yeah, I just gotta get myself up to actually making something.

102
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:14,107
Rym: just do it.

103
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:20,746
Scott: yeah You know the first step is the biggest one and as soon as I start something I can't stop doing it.

104
00:06:21,228 --> 00:06:21,609
Rym: so do it.

105
00:06:22,171 --> 00:06:23,296
Scott: I gotta actually do it.

106
00:06:23,356 --> 00:06:24,601
Rym: Well, then do it just do it.

107
00:06:25,203 --> 00:06:25,926
Rym: Why don't you just do it?

108
00:06:26,087 --> 00:06:26,810
Scott: It's not that easy.

109
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:27,252
Rym: Yes, it is.

110
00:06:27,272 --> 00:06:27,935
Rym: you could just start.

111
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:31,310
Rym: you could just sit down and say I'm going to do X and start doing it.

112
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,279
Scott: It's real hard when this is real fun game to play instead.

113
00:06:34,299 --> 00:06:37,188
Rym: Oh, so then you don't have any willpower.

114
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:39,158
Scott: Yeah, I do Don't want how.

115
00:06:39,219 --> 00:06:40,289
Scott: I'd rather play the game.

116
00:06:41,071 --> 00:06:44,044
Scott: My will makes me play the game instead of doing something else.

117
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:45,470
Rym: so then why do you want to do something else?

118
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,666
Rym: Cuz obviously the game is the only thing you really want to do.

119
00:06:47,686 --> 00:06:52,128
Scott: yeah It is what I really want to do until it's done, then I don't want to do it anymore, okay?

120
00:06:53,731 --> 00:06:55,843
Rym: I get sick of games real quick nowadays.

121
00:06:55,863 --> 00:06:57,732
Scott:  Yeah, me too.

122
00:06:57,772 --> 00:06:59,318
Scott: That's why it's a damn good game.

123
00:06:59,338 --> 00:07:02,932
Rym: Yeah, keep me interested I'll play it someday.

124
00:07:02,952 --> 00:07:06,866
Rym: I really not don't have any interest in buying a faster computer anytime soon.

125
00:07:07,047 --> 00:07:10,142
Scott: yet You just you haven't played it yet when if you actually played it.

126
00:07:10,162 --> 00:07:13,056
Rym: You'd be like oh, oh yeah It's probably a great game, but keep in mind.

127
00:07:13,076 --> 00:07:15,790
Rym: I never played half-life 1 until a few years ago.

128
00:07:16,191 --> 00:07:17,135
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't matter.

129
00:07:17,658 --> 00:07:20,309
Rym: so I'll probably play half-life 2 a few years from now.

130
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,137
Scott: Yeah, if it's still hey.

131
00:07:23,158 --> 00:07:27,269
Scott: Yes, the thing is that steam could you know at any minute disappear, then it's done.

132
00:07:28,975 --> 00:07:33,159
Scott: so for real news S&P which is standard and poor's.

133
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,870
Scott: if you did not know there's some business II group.

134
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,194
Scott: I guess they have.

135
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:41,650
Scott: you know the S&P 500 like the 500 companies that are awesome.

136
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:46,370
Rym: I guess I think everyone knows what the S&P is all right, and if they don't know they probably don't care.

137
00:07:46,572 --> 00:07:48,450
Scott: It's a business thing anyway.

138
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:54,110
Scott: What they do is they recommend which stocks you should buy and which ones you should sell.

139
00:07:54,954 --> 00:08:04,670
Scott: So you know that's that's how things work now Recommendations for stocks are largely bullshit, and I'm not going to talk about that now.

140
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:11,370
Scott: But I am going to talk about the recommendation on one particular stock by analyst John Yang.

141
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:17,690
Scott: Now the previous recommendation for this stock was the worst recommendation possible.

142
00:08:18,071 --> 00:08:19,256
Scott: Strong sell.

143
00:08:19,356 --> 00:08:20,781
Scott: that means holy shit.

144
00:08:20,802 --> 00:08:22,287
Scott: sell this thing sinking ship.

145
00:08:22,387 --> 00:08:30,761
Scott: Oh my god He has changed his recommendation to plain old sell which means alright, yeah, just sell it.

146
00:08:31,123 --> 00:08:31,626
Scott: it's no good.

147
00:08:31,646 --> 00:08:41,030
Scott: and You might have guessed already the stock that is rated so poorly is Sony.

148
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:44,964
Rym: So apparently they're getting better if it went from strong sell to sell.

149
00:08:44,984 --> 00:08:56,430
Scott: it says here Since the current price of Sony shares is near the 12-month target price of $44 They're going to make it sell whereas it was strong sell.

150
00:08:56,771 --> 00:09:06,282
Scott: But it says here we continue to believe that any potential upside in share price would be limited by a lack of visibility in Sony's games division.

151
00:09:06,704 --> 00:09:07,808
Scott: ha ha ha ha ha.

152
00:09:08,189 --> 00:09:15,027
Scott: so even Business people are saying Sony has no vision in their games division.

153
00:09:15,448 --> 00:09:17,756
Scott: vision vision No visibility in the games division.

154
00:09:17,796 --> 00:09:21,630
Scott: It doesn't matter business people think Sony's games suck, and they don't even play games.

155
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,312
Scott: They're businessmen.

156
00:09:22,352 --> 00:09:23,215
Scott: What the hell do they know?

157
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:27,350
Rym: they know about wearing suits and yelling at people yeah, and they think Sony sucks, too.

158
00:09:29,872 --> 00:09:31,742
Rym: I had to keep ripping on Sony, but no I don't.

159
00:09:31,782 --> 00:09:32,385
Rym: I freaking love it.

160
00:09:32,426 --> 00:09:33,552
Rym: I hate Sony I don't.

161
00:09:33,592 --> 00:09:34,919
Rym: he used to be all right.

162
00:09:34,939 --> 00:09:43,148
Scott: so 80s they were awesome and then in the 90s they were all right and then now in the 2000s.

163
00:09:43,188 --> 00:09:43,710
Scott: They're poop.

164
00:09:44,312 --> 00:09:46,160
Rym: Yeah, I mean it's not just that they're bad.

165
00:09:46,481 --> 00:09:50,090
Rym: if they were just a bad company that made poor decisions I wouldn't be so hard on him.

166
00:09:50,110 --> 00:10:00,870
Rym: I just say wow they suck, but they've gone out of their way to anger their Consumers and their customers that every step of the way they have put viruses on their customers computers.

167
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,229
Rym: I can't remind you of that enough.

168
00:10:03,744 --> 00:10:04,712
Scott: Yeah Think about this.

169
00:10:05,013 --> 00:10:11,030
Scott: people like Infinium labs are not as bad as Sony because Infinium while they trick idiots out of money.

170
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,153
Scott: Yeah, all Infinium.

171
00:10:12,193 --> 00:10:12,414
Scott: Did is?

172
00:10:12,474 --> 00:10:14,801
Scott: they made a phony product that doesn't really exist.

173
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:17,550
Scott: they get people to invest in the phony product.

174
00:10:17,813 --> 00:10:19,209
Scott: They're not selling it to anyone.

175
00:10:19,491 --> 00:10:24,650
Scott: They're just providing everywhere all the customers and can you know gamers out there with a lot of humorous anecdotes?

176
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:31,773
Scott: Sony is putting viruses on your computers and And Stealing your money.

177
00:10:31,794 --> 00:10:32,776
Rym: What was that?

178
00:10:32,817 --> 00:10:34,140
Rym: you were like smacking your lips.

179
00:10:34,642 --> 00:10:35,825
Scott: I burped or something.

180
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:37,370
Scott: it was kind of okay.

181
00:10:38,356 --> 00:10:40,127
Rym: I was just curious cuz that was louder than usual.

182
00:10:40,147 --> 00:10:42,614
Scott: some Gastroesophagus little movements.

183
00:10:43,096 --> 00:10:44,360
Rym: you should do something about that.

184
00:10:45,002 --> 00:10:46,647
Rym: what I don't know.

185
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:47,389
Rym: not eat.

186
00:10:48,852 --> 00:10:49,916
Rym: Maybe eat better food.

187
00:10:49,937 --> 00:10:51,584
Scott: I ain't just fine food.

188
00:10:51,604 --> 00:10:55,015
Scott: Yeah, all right Who do I eat?

189
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:55,598
Scott: that's no good.

190
00:10:55,618 --> 00:10:56,261
Scott: I don't know.

191
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,930
Rym: but whatever it is it caused you to be all burpee.

192
00:10:59,051 --> 00:11:00,054
Scott: I'm burpee all the time.

193
00:11:00,074 --> 00:11:02,843
Rym: Yeah, maybe you got a bad intestine.

194
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:03,766
Scott: No.

195
00:11:03,786 --> 00:11:04,990
Scott: I think my intestines all right.

196
00:11:07,371 --> 00:11:08,335
Rym: Anyway go on with your news.

197
00:11:08,395 --> 00:11:09,380
Rym: I wasn't trying to stop you.

198
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,203
Scott: that was my news.

199
00:11:10,223 --> 00:11:10,785
Scott: Sony sucks.

200
00:11:10,966 --> 00:11:11,729
Rym: That's all you had to say.

201
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,696
Scott: Yeah, so just you know.

202
00:11:14,917 --> 00:11:16,923
Scott: just more evidence on the on the burner.

203
00:11:17,646 --> 00:11:17,766
Rym: Well.

204
00:11:17,786 --> 00:11:19,050
Rym: I'll be real quick on my news.

205
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:44,830
Rym: there's an article on slash dot about a book and a bunch of associated articles and the gist of them is simply that Chemistry and chemistry hobbyists in the United States are fast disappearing as the government in its fear of terrorism and crystal meth as Systematically work to eliminate any venue of Americans acquiring anything remotely dangerous to themselves or others.

206
00:11:45,273 --> 00:11:46,909
Scott: God crystal meth God all right.

207
00:11:47,793 --> 00:12:00,290
Scott: It's getting so bad with this crystal meth shit that the negative effects That of the laws used to contain crystal meth are probably getting to be worse than crystal meth itself.

208
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:05,245
Rym: They're directly affecting me, which is something that doesn't have like foreign policy as despite.

209
00:12:05,265 --> 00:12:11,301
Rym: You know the horrible possible You know genocide type things going on in Iraq and all the horrible things our country does.

210
00:12:11,843 --> 00:12:18,284
Rym: it doesn't directly affect my day-to-day Life yet, no it doesn't crystal meth itself.

211
00:12:18,485 --> 00:12:27,990
Rym: people who use crystal meth Do not affect my life directly in any way But the laws trying to stop them from doing their crystal meth are screwing me repeatedly and annoyingly.

212
00:12:28,871 --> 00:12:31,846
Scott: It's I might as well just do crystal meth.

213
00:12:32,348 --> 00:12:41,067
Scott: no No, you really don't want to But it would be only slightly worse than all the things that the laws are doing to me now.

214
00:12:41,187 --> 00:12:50,930
Rym: actually to me Crystal meth is something that only exists because there is a war on drugs in the United States Because crystal meth is a terrible terrible drug.

215
00:12:51,412 --> 00:13:00,130
Rym: I mean say what you will about people who smoke marijuana and people who use cocaine But the negative health effects of marijuana at least are minimal.

216
00:13:00,771 --> 00:13:03,277
Rym: Crystal meth destroys a human being.

217
00:13:03,738 --> 00:13:09,050
Rym: no person who of any intelligence would use crystal meth if anything else were available.

218
00:13:09,752 --> 00:13:21,529
Rym: Yet people manufacture and use crystal meth and the reason they do so is that it's really one of the only drugs left in the world that any idiot can make from any chemicals they can get their hands on.

219
00:13:21,549 --> 00:13:29,650
Rym: as A result the government has tried to make these chemicals illegal Even though these chemicals are highly useful in a wide variety of industries and applications.

220
00:13:30,552 --> 00:13:46,509
Rym: So now when I want, you know Sudafed because I have a cold I have to sign a thing and show ID and I can't buy more than X amount of it and I have to go Behind the counter and a lot of places just won't stock it and a lot of drugs are Taking the Sudafed part out of their drug in order to not have to go through this.

221
00:13:48,552 --> 00:13:51,644
Rym: Luckily we stocked up on all sorts of Sudafed and Nyquil.

222
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:56,505
Rym: All right, of course I'm sure that flagged us as crystal meth manufacturers somewhere.

223
00:13:56,525 --> 00:14:05,490
Rym: All right But it just seems that I mean laws aren't keeping the crystal meth people down.

224
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,237
Scott: They're keeping normal people down.

225
00:14:07,257 --> 00:14:15,347
Rym: and it's not just that the government is really working Fervently to take away anything that could be dangerous to anyone.

226
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:23,317
Rym: now I note that for the vast majority of human existence on this earth dangerous things abounded and people died.

227
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:32,317
Rym: and I guess the modern term for it is acceptable casualties that there is a level or a rate of Accidental death in a population.

228
00:14:32,678 --> 00:14:37,010
Rym: that is acceptable because it not to sound cruel, but it weeds out the stupid people.

229
00:14:37,939 --> 00:14:41,600
Rym: It also Reminds the people who survive that you got to be careful.

230
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,864
Rym: The world isn't Disneyland.

231
00:14:43,146 --> 00:14:44,330
Rym: The world is a dangerous place.

232
00:14:44,712 --> 00:14:49,190
Rym: You can go to the grocery store and there are at least a hundred things you can buy that are deadly if used improperly.

233
00:14:49,832 --> 00:14:53,570
Scott: let's see ammonia and bleach.

234
00:14:54,571 --> 00:14:57,139
Rym: Yeah, see they worry about you know, all these things.

235
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,467
Rym: you could mix ammonia and bleach and make one hell of a chlorine gas bomb in short order.

236
00:15:03,131 --> 00:15:06,367
Scott: Yep, but hell you know what you'll fucking get shit clean.

237
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:06,930
Scott: god damn it.

238
00:15:07,651 --> 00:15:09,771
Rym: Actually, I don't think it works So well it.

239
00:15:09,871 --> 00:15:19,242
Scott: actually if you take ammonia and bleach and we're like a gas mask or something and try to clean your kitchen floor and You have a kitchen floor that won't be destroyed by ammonia and bleach together.

240
00:15:19,663 --> 00:15:20,245
Scott: God damn.

241
00:15:20,265 --> 00:15:21,510
Scott: Will that be a clean kitchen floor?

242
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:22,153
Scott: Let me tell you.

243
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:25,110
Rym: um, are you basing this on anything or is this purely anecdotal?

244
00:15:25,896 --> 00:15:32,081
Scott: I think I read a story somewhere once about Someone who is stupid and mixed ammonia and bleach and clean their kitchen floor.

245
00:15:32,101 --> 00:15:35,050
Scott: real nice, but like almost died and went to the hospital.

246
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:42,230
Rym: Great, that's the guy you want to listen to when you're looking for your advice on chlorine gas and bleach ammonia.

247
00:15:43,031 --> 00:15:48,630
Scott: Well, I know that you know, it's something you should never do but you know not about to do it to clean the floor.

248
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:52,581
Rym: Actually, I have a funny chlorine gas story from high school.

249
00:15:52,943 --> 00:15:53,344
Scott: All right, Lee.

250
00:15:53,765 --> 00:15:59,670
Rym: Yeah, we I was in a God actually was when I was in middle school, but they bused me to the high school to take biology.

251
00:16:00,331 --> 00:16:02,641
Rym: so I was over in the high school with my biology and I was.

252
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:21,303
Rym: I was like a little punk eighth grader, you know with the Tude and we're doing some lab We had nitric acid and all sorts of things and I forget exactly what was in the bottle but there was a bottle of something might have been bleach and This kid I don't know if I don't think it was bleach It was something this kid in the back of the room and we're all working around.

253
00:16:21,765 --> 00:16:32,503
Rym: I hear him say hey I wonder what'll happen if I dump this in here and I look up and I see him pouring nitric acid into an unlabeled bottle And gas started billowing out.

254
00:16:32,523 --> 00:16:42,270
Rym: Oh So I walked outside the room to the teacher and I said, I think Craig just made a bomb of chlorine gas.

255
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:46,209
Rym: And the teacher walked back into the room and said holy shit.

256
00:16:47,452 --> 00:16:51,290
Rym: And we had to evacuate the school for like two hours and he got a whole school.

257
00:16:51,632 --> 00:16:54,770
Rym: Well, they evacuated the school because they called they someone pulled the fire alarm.

258
00:16:55,332 --> 00:17:00,470
Rym: Oh and then two hours later that I lost back into the classroom and he got fucking suspended.

259
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:07,290
Rym: Of course, I know that they didn't expel him or call him a terrorist or anything like they probably would today.

260
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,656
Scott: Yeah, cuz he was just stupid.

261
00:17:08,676 --> 00:17:10,145
Scott: He wasn't trying to be all.

262
00:17:10,165 --> 00:17:12,034
Scott: a Terrorist is someone who goes.

263
00:17:12,054 --> 00:17:13,378
Scott: I got a bomb.

264
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,249
Scott: you either give me a billion dollars or I'll blow up the school.

265
00:17:17,032 --> 00:17:18,459
Scott: Someone who goes oh shit.

266
00:17:18,499 --> 00:17:20,207
Scott: I accidentally made a chlorine bomb.

267
00:17:20,308 --> 00:17:31,910
Rym: Oh, no I Mean, I guess my favorite quotation nowadays is never a sign to malice or evil What can easily be explained by stupidity?

268
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:42,161
Rym: indeed Indeed, but I mean it in general that the gist of a lot this article as I'm trying to get back to my new store Is that the government is trying.

269
00:17:42,181 --> 00:17:43,628
Rym: the government and people who are?

270
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:52,524
Rym: wusses or People who have gone through a loss and for some reason have decided this is now their crusade Are trying to make America safe from everything.

271
00:17:53,066 --> 00:17:58,750
Rym: as a result We're there's a generation of children growing up right now who don't know that the world is dangerous.

272
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:09,030
Rym: Or don't realize that it's very easy to hurt yourself and a lot of people just go down like chumps You know hit by a car fall the wrong way in the grocery store and crack your head open and die.

273
00:18:09,612 --> 00:18:12,625
Rym: People die in weird crazy sudden ways.

274
00:18:12,645 --> 00:18:22,466
Rym: read for ya God Yeah, I could spend all day reading the FARC headlines that are relevant to this discussion.

275
00:18:22,687 --> 00:18:27,327
Rym: probably yes I guess I'm really of the mind that you should.

276
00:18:27,347 --> 00:18:42,810
Rym: I mean you should obviously Try to protect the majority of people from things and you should obviously protect people from real Clear dangers like if there's a high-voltage Your fence put a sign on it that says this fence is electrified.

277
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:43,780
Scott: This is no way to know.

278
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:48,702
Rym: looking at the fence yeah, if a danger is not obvious then it you should help protect people against it.

279
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:57,250
Rym: if a danger is obvious and known and Protecting against it is more valuable to society than the benefit gained from ignoring it then go nuts.

280
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:13,050
Rym: But the moment your protections against something dangerous are worse than the actual effects of the dangerous thing Like, you know the fact that in many playgrounds nowadays kids aren't allowed to run or play tag Because running is dangerous and tag promotes fighting?

281
00:19:13,871 --> 00:19:15,036
Rym: Yeah, I'm not kidding.

282
00:19:15,076 --> 00:19:15,759
Rym: That was a story.

283
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,476
Rym: In fact, that was multiple stories about a month ago I think.

284
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:22,008
Scott: actually Penn Jillette had the greatest saying when it came to this.

285
00:19:22,048 --> 00:19:30,224
Scott: he said Let those who ride Decide and I think the problem here is that people who are not riding are deciding.

286
00:19:30,786 --> 00:19:34,984
Scott: it should be up to Bikers whether they want to wear helmets or not.

287
00:19:35,266 --> 00:19:40,490
Scott: now at the same time It should be up to kids whether they think playing tag is dangerous or not.

288
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,725
Rym: Well, if not the kit one for the helmets.

289
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:50,850
Rym: now I would be fine if I gave a city or a government passed a law saying if you would get an accident without a helmet We're not paying for your ass.

290
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:55,710
Scott: Yeah, no, the law is if you aren't wearing a helmet the cop can pull you over and write you a ticket.

291
00:19:55,951 --> 00:19:57,998
Rym: Oh, yeah, no, but I have.

292
00:19:58,038 --> 00:20:02,834
Rym: now you should have the right to choose to do something stupid that won't harm anyone But you however.

293
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:07,310
Rym: indeed there should be laws to protect society from your stupid ass.

294
00:20:07,811 --> 00:20:17,080
Scott: Yeah, but if I make a playground with swings and a seesaw and an old-fashioned jungle gym You don't have to use it if you're using it.

295
00:20:17,181 --> 00:20:18,446
Scott: You're accepting the risk.

296
00:20:18,707 --> 00:20:19,550
Rym: now I say for kids.

297
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:22,230
Rym: I mean it would be alright if the parent could make that decision for a kid.

298
00:20:22,664 --> 00:20:31,739
Scott: Yeah a parent can say I think that if I had a kid and I went to a playground that was all rusty with jagged metal shit And it was crawling with tetanus.

299
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:33,510
Scott: I'd be like you're not playing on that playground.

300
00:20:34,339 --> 00:20:39,801
Scott: but What you know, you shouldn't force every town to make stupid shit playgrounds.

301
00:20:40,122 --> 00:20:43,049
Scott: some parents want to let their kids plan real playgrounds.

302
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,555
Scott: Yeah, some kids want to play.

303
00:20:44,696 --> 00:20:48,129
Scott: all kids want to plan real playgrounds and they should be allowed to do so.

304
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:49,001
Scott: You shouldn't?

305
00:20:49,387 --> 00:21:01,083
Scott: you know It's okay to keep people safe or to decide for yourself that you don't want to do something You might think is dangerous But you shouldn't be allowed to deny other people their freedom to take risks.

306
00:21:01,564 --> 00:21:07,790
Scott: as long as those people recognize the risk They are taking and accept, you know their fault if someone gets hurt.

307
00:21:08,091 --> 00:21:12,007
Rym: Yep, the problem is a lot of people and I think this is a byproduct.

308
00:21:12,048 --> 00:21:17,930
Rym: It's like a self-fulfilling prophecy People aren't able to recognize when a situation is dangerous.

309
00:21:18,572 --> 00:21:24,250
Rym: Now the my best way to explain this with a simple kind of an analogy is you know what amusement parks how they have those?

310
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:32,370
Rym: Like gas-powered cars that you can drive them on a little track with your family But there's a like wire or a cable under it so you can't actually drive it off the track.

311
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:35,009
Rym: Yep Now those are at every amusement park and kids love them.

312
00:21:35,592 --> 00:21:42,844
Rym: But you know kids know nowadays that you're a hundred percent safe at amusement park Because you know they strap you in and everything's set up for you.

313
00:21:42,864 --> 00:21:43,889
Rym: Can't really hurt yourself.

314
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:51,309
Rym: So every kid when they're going around the corner and they see the tree They turn the wheel and go straight for the tree because they know the thing will save them.

315
00:21:51,792 --> 00:21:54,185
Rym: Mm-hmm now this is getting that way in real life.

316
00:21:54,246 --> 00:22:02,410
Rym: to people It's like people hold their hands up on a roller coaster because they know That no roller coaster would be set up so that your hands could hit and hurt yourself.

317
00:22:03,012 --> 00:22:09,436
Rym: They stick their hand as far into the lion cage as they can because they know that it's set up so the lion can't get Them in the real world.

318
00:22:09,476 --> 00:22:13,270
Rym: It's not that way and things are dangerous, and it can never be that way.

319
00:22:13,751 --> 00:22:18,730
Scott: If you did make it that way we would be the Lions in the cage and the Lions would be roaming free.

320
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:21,932
Rym: I Mean it just.

321
00:22:22,414 --> 00:22:37,969
Rym: I think that as kids grow up in these sterile environments where they're protected from every possible danger and None of them have the example of breaking their arm once and realizing that it sucks to break your arm Or having their friend break his hip and knowing that it really sucks to break your hip.

322
00:22:38,873 --> 00:22:44,475
Rym: They won't recognize danger when they're really confronted with it and as a result They're not able to deal with it.

323
00:22:45,037 --> 00:22:48,630
Rym: then as a result when you know some something finally happens.

324
00:22:49,092 --> 00:22:58,250
Rym: The survivors of them who also can't recognize danger Realize that a law needs to be passed to protect people from this and it gets worse and worse and worse.

325
00:22:58,725 --> 00:23:07,604
Scott: Yeah If you're a kid and you never relax never had a swing to jump off of then you don't really know how high you can Jump and fall off a swing without getting hurt.

326
00:23:07,725 --> 00:23:12,945
Rym: Yeah when I was a kid I learned that after about 15 feet it really fucking hurt to fall off of something.

327
00:23:13,146 --> 00:23:13,869
Rym: Yeah, and you know what?

328
00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:17,290
Rym: nowadays I know exactly how far I can fall before I risk hurting myself.

329
00:23:17,872 --> 00:23:21,124
Scott: Let me summarize this whole thing a little less eloquently.

330
00:23:21,144 --> 00:23:22,068
Scott: you ready?

331
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:22,690
Rym: I'm ready.

332
00:23:22,951 --> 00:23:25,889
Scott: You're all a bunch of sissies and if you get in my way, I'm gonna kick your ass.

333
00:23:28,212 --> 00:23:39,029
Scott: If I'm elected mayor I'll kill a lot of you and burn your town to cinders Exactly making a country of wusses as soon as uh All the old people die and we're left with just the wusses.

334
00:23:39,331 --> 00:23:42,161
Scott: Someone's gonna come over here and beat the shit out of us and we'll deserve it.

335
00:23:42,202 --> 00:23:42,704
Scott: God damn it.

336
00:23:43,105 --> 00:23:46,477
Rym: I I guess look 50 years ago.

337
00:23:46,497 --> 00:23:47,861
Rym: I mean sissies.

338
00:23:48,263 --> 00:23:50,530
Rym: not that many kids died on playgrounds.

339
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:57,830
Rym: Nowadays a tiny percentage fewer children die on playgrounds, but playgrounds suck a thousand percent more.

340
00:23:58,516 --> 00:24:21,709
Scott: yep, you know the Adults always is one of my major gripes because I come from a town that is literally 90% houses and in half those houses were families with kids and half those houses were old people and they were basically in a constant battle between the old people who didn't want to pay school tax and the families who wanted awesome family shit.

341
00:24:21,729 --> 00:24:25,118
Scott: and People always wonder why are kids doing drugs?

342
00:24:25,439 --> 00:24:28,990
Scott: Why are kids having sex and making teenage girls pregnant?

343
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,029
Scott: Why are kids getting drunk?

344
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,874
Scott: Why are kids doing all this stuff?

345
00:24:33,095 --> 00:24:38,110
Scott: because you took away everything else fun because it was extremely less dangerous.

346
00:24:38,553 --> 00:24:48,590
Rym: Yep, I mean luckily where I grew up there was though Apparently this has changed and it's actually kind of sad to me that I can think back through my life and watch the progression.

347
00:24:49,032 --> 00:24:58,449
Rym: Like when I was a kid my parents complained about how playgrounds weren't the way they used to be and then as I grew up They just got worse In schools and everything, but at least where I grew up

348
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:02,645
Scott: They got better for a short time when they built all those giant wooden castles.

349
00:25:02,805 --> 00:25:06,079
Rym: Yep, but then they took those away Yep, and then they melt really low to the ground.

350
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,988
Rym: plastic shit castles shit cells Yeah.

351
00:25:10,653 --> 00:25:16,910
Rym: But I grew up in an area where well I think it was mostly because it was Michigan where there was no mass transit or anything and there are a lot of roads.

352
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:19,217
Scott: Let's change our topic for today to just this.

353
00:25:19,538 --> 00:25:20,461
Rym: All right, then that's good.

354
00:25:20,481 --> 00:25:21,986
Rym: We'll do the airline industry some other time.

355
00:25:22,106 --> 00:25:28,030
Rym: Yes, so Everyone had cars and by the end and kids who didn't have cars new people who had cars.

356
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:34,930
Rym: so when you know, you were 12 or 13, you know a 15 year old who had a car and As a result we were mostly free.

357
00:25:35,512 --> 00:25:45,305
Rym: so we would all go hang out in an ice cream shop or we'd all drive to the amusement park on a Random day in the summer and there was stuff to do as a result in my neighborhood.

358
00:25:45,345 --> 00:25:46,690
Rym: There was very little drug use.

359
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:50,490
Rym: There was very little teenage alcoholism and things were going pretty well.

360
00:25:51,391 --> 00:25:55,065
Rym: Bit by bit parents have not allowed their kids to do anything back in my hometown.

361
00:25:55,386 --> 00:25:56,450
Rym: Well, let him drive around.

362
00:25:56,671 --> 00:26:05,890
Rym: they can't get their licenses till they're 18 now and as a result drug problems started appearing and Alcohol problems started appearing because kids had nothing to fuck do.

363
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,985
Scott: Yeah, gee, I'm bored.

364
00:26:09,045 --> 00:26:09,609
Scott: What can I do?

365
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:16,370
Scott: Well, I can play video games, but I'm a kid with no job and no money So I can't really I can't have no and video games are dangerous.

366
00:26:16,772 --> 00:26:19,290
Rym: Yeah, that video game can't buy the fun video games.

367
00:26:19,491 --> 00:26:24,990
Scott: But even when you can kids don't have enough money to buy enough video games so that they can entertain themselves all the time.

368
00:26:25,431 --> 00:26:26,796
Scott: Kids can't afford to do hobbies.

369
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:33,375
Scott: We do like building plenty of computers and you know Expensive $40 board game.

370
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:36,225
Rym: my parents would take me to an arcade like once a month.

371
00:26:36,907 --> 00:26:37,910
Scott: Yeah, I hardly ever.

372
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,669
Scott: We only went to arcades on vacations just cuz there weren't any.

373
00:26:41,711 --> 00:26:43,800
Rym: Now I mean now it's like that real-life comic.

374
00:26:44,122 --> 00:26:48,578
Rym: I can go to an arcade and spend $1,000 if I want to and no one will stop me.

375
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:49,501
Scott: Yep.

376
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:51,748
Scott: God, that's bad.

377
00:26:51,788 --> 00:26:52,470
Scott: We shouldn't do that.

378
00:26:53,651 --> 00:26:54,475
Rym: It was actually a good thing.

379
00:26:54,535 --> 00:26:55,520
Rym: I flew to an amazement.

380
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,729
Rym: It prevented me from buying anything in the dealer's room.

381
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:06,381
Scott: Mmm Yeah, so, you know the old people complain about.

382
00:27:06,441 --> 00:27:08,930
Scott: you know kids having a loud dance party.

383
00:27:09,231 --> 00:27:13,730
Scott: But if kids are smoking weed in their room, no one will know and no one will complain.

384
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:23,999
Scott: Yep, until they find out they're smoking weed and then they'll complain, you know It's this one thing that kids can do has a consequence, you know Skiing there's a consequence.

385
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:25,830
Scott: You might break your legs and die.

386
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:31,350
Scott: Yeah in the the average injury of skiing is not so bad.

387
00:27:31,532 --> 00:27:32,645
Scott: I mean you may break an arm.

388
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:38,970
Rym: Yeah, very few people die skiing unless you're skiing on like a black diamond or a double black diamond.

389
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:42,280
Scott: But you can easily prevent people from skiing.

390
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:44,086
Scott: you just close the ski mountain.

391
00:27:44,647 --> 00:27:45,410
Scott: No one can ski.

392
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:50,009
Rym: No, no, remember that Google video those kids trying to ski down that sand dune in a box.

393
00:27:50,672 --> 00:27:52,097
Scott: Yeah, but you can't get.

394
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:55,990
Scott: you know, you can easily prevent people from doing real skiing on snowy mountains.

395
00:27:56,291 --> 00:28:00,225
Scott: You turn off the snow machines you ID people before you let them on the ski lift.

396
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:01,389
Scott: It's very easy to stop.

397
00:28:02,312 --> 00:28:11,150
Scott: it's very hard to stop people from doing drugs and having sex and all sorts of other things that have much much worse consequences.

398
00:28:12,118 --> 00:28:28,986
Scott: so You know, they prevent any anything they can and the only holes they leave open are you know things that have far worse consequences and they don't realize they're basically forcing their kids to do the worst thing possible or Sit around and do nothing.

399
00:28:29,046 --> 00:28:35,621
Scott: I mean We should go find some parents who were doing this kind of shit and say well What do you think your kid should do after school?

400
00:28:35,662 --> 00:28:36,426
Scott: and that's like homework.

401
00:28:36,788 --> 00:28:40,580
Scott: All right He finishes his homework in 20 minutes because he's not an idiot now.

402
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,563
Scott: What should your kid do?

403
00:28:42,144 --> 00:28:42,646
Scott: watch TV?

404
00:28:42,886 --> 00:28:51,490
Rym: Yeah Yeah, I mean it's scary But I was actually talking a few days ago to a friend of mine who is living still in sterling heights backward.

405
00:28:51,791 --> 00:28:54,000
Rym: I don't know if he's living there now, but he was there.

406
00:28:54,121 --> 00:28:54,884
Rym: He was talking about it.

407
00:28:54,904 --> 00:29:01,708
Rym: We were catching up on your old business when I grew up you know in Detroit a new Baltimore and sterling heights and all those places.

408
00:29:01,728 --> 00:29:09,894
Rym: if I on a random summer day or a day after school just got up got on my bike and went off into the neighborhood Within about five minutes.

409
00:29:09,954 --> 00:29:17,275
Rym: I'd run into a whole pack of kids and we would roam around doing kid things all day my when I was a kid.

410
00:29:17,316 --> 00:29:34,726
Scott: on my block there was a kid who lived down one street and two kids who lived on the other street and Pretty much after school everyone would be doing something in their yard or maybe playing a video game in their house and Before you knew it, you know everyone to go around on their bikes knock on each other's doors.

411
00:29:34,786 --> 00:29:36,994
Scott: if they were inside Play wiffle.

412
00:29:37,034 --> 00:29:41,730
Scott: I remember played wiffle ball every night for a whole summer until it snowed and we couldn't play anymore.

413
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:43,053
Rym: But I mean you.

414
00:29:43,174 --> 00:29:49,878
Rym: if you walked around outside on any given nice day if the weather was nice there were kids Everywhere outside running around just doing stuff.

415
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,270
Scott: when my mom was a kid, you know, she lived in Queens, New York.

416
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:59,830
Scott: You know kids you just used to tell your eight-year-old kid go walk down the street to the grocery store and get some eggs.

417
00:30:00,393 --> 00:30:01,479
Scott: You don't do that anymore.

418
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,229
Scott: Your kid can't go out in the street alone.

419
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:07,506
Rym: Yeah, nowadays that my friend was telling me he was.

420
00:30:07,546 --> 00:30:08,530
Rym: he went back to the hometown.

421
00:30:08,631 --> 00:30:12,389
Rym: He was you know driving around just looking at the old side seeing what was built new.

422
00:30:13,332 --> 00:30:16,009
Rym: It was a beautiful sunny day, but not a kid to be seen.

423
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:21,235
Rym: There was like one kid playing catch with his dad in their front yard And other than that does nothing.

424
00:30:21,275 --> 00:30:22,018
Rym: the streets were empty.

425
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:22,720
Scott: see the front.

426
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,085
Scott: the reason the cause of this.

427
00:30:24,527 --> 00:30:29,103
Rym: as I see it All right, I think it's a combination of video games TV and mean world syndrome.

428
00:30:29,826 --> 00:30:30,990
Scott: Well, I think it's.

429
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:34,420
Scott: There's a perception that the world is more dangerous.

430
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:34,702
Rym: Yes.

431
00:30:35,003 --> 00:30:36,790
Rym: Are you have you ever heard the term mean world syndrome?

432
00:30:36,911 --> 00:30:37,615
Scott: Is that what that is?

433
00:30:37,756 --> 00:30:40,070
Rym: Yes, actually I have a book on it over there.

434
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:44,290
Rym: I'm not gonna go get it, but we studied this quite a bit in our communications classes.

435
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:56,730
Rym: basically mean world syndrome is something that has come up basically since World War two where they've really studied it where People have a perception of reality and then there's the actual reality.

436
00:30:57,493 --> 00:31:01,749
Rym: For example, they would ask people do you know or know anyone who knows?

437
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:06,369
Rym: Someone who was involved in a murder or who was murdered and think questions like that?

438
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:09,446
Rym: And they compare those and actually my answer really is yes.

439
00:31:09,466 --> 00:31:09,929
Rym: Mm-hmm.

440
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:29,410
Rym: but then they compare those answers to the actual crime statistics or You know things like that and did not get into a lot of detail in America in modern America it is shown that people perceive the crime rates and The dangers of the outside world to be far greater than the actual crime rate.

441
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:36,177
Rym: That's rather obvious and part of the reason for this and there are a lot of reason news Is that the news is number one?

442
00:31:36,598 --> 00:31:37,100
Rym: Yes one.

443
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,710
Rym: the news reports mostly on bad news.

444
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:51,190
Scott: So all you do every night is come home turn on the TV and you watch ten stories about Terrible things that happen near you and you begin to think the outside world is terrible just like the news.

445
00:31:51,531 --> 00:31:52,717
Rym: Yep, and it's not just the news.

446
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:54,164
Rym: I mean TV shows and media.

447
00:31:54,205 --> 00:31:55,170
Rym: They all play a part in it.

448
00:31:55,471 --> 00:31:56,859
Scott: I mean the most popular TV shows.

449
00:31:56,899 --> 00:31:58,749
Scott: my grandma only watches police shows.

450
00:31:59,733 --> 00:32:04,850
Scott: There are that many shows about police and criminals doing bad stuff and then going to jail.

451
00:32:05,572 --> 00:32:10,990
Rym: But it's just that people are much more afraid of the world than the world warrants at least in the United States.

452
00:32:11,451 --> 00:32:11,692
Scott: Mm-hmm.

453
00:32:12,174 --> 00:32:12,977
Scott: It's not see.

454
00:32:13,157 --> 00:32:13,318
Scott: here's.

455
00:32:13,358 --> 00:32:16,590
Scott: the other problem is you have kids playing on the block, right?

456
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:21,645
Scott: Then parents begin to think that there's dangerous child predators out there and maybe there are.

457
00:32:22,047 --> 00:32:26,005
Rym: maybe there aren't but you know What there were back in the 50s and there were back in the 1900s.

458
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:29,382
Rym: You know what there were probably the same number back in the 1800s.

459
00:32:29,402 --> 00:32:29,543
Rym: Mm-hmm.

460
00:32:31,573 --> 00:32:35,466
Scott: And so parents start to protect their kids and don't let them play outside anymore.

461
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:39,660
Scott: Well now Because there are no kids outside.

462
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,910
Scott: It becomes a more dangerous place.

463
00:32:42,552 --> 00:32:47,309
Scott: See if you go somewhere as a bunch of kids hanging out outside criminals don't go there.

464
00:32:47,711 --> 00:32:47,911
Scott: They.

465
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:53,230
Scott: that's how it is and anyone who does go over there is either a parent or a pedophile.

466
00:32:53,511 --> 00:33:06,043
Rym: Well, it's like we've said many times and this is for anyone who has never lived in a big city the dangerous neighborhoods are not the ones where dangerous minorities or Punk looking kids are hanging out in the street all the time.

467
00:33:06,183 --> 00:33:07,550
Scott: You see people hanging out in the street.

468
00:33:07,751 --> 00:33:10,705
Scott: That's an awesome party in the street neighborhood or in the very least.

469
00:33:10,765 --> 00:33:11,810
Rym: It's an okay neighborhood.

470
00:33:11,891 --> 00:33:18,273
Scott: It might be a little scuzzy, but if it's not dangerous Yeah, those might be all homeless drunk guys But even then it's.

471
00:33:18,293 --> 00:33:19,196
Rym: that's still a step up.

472
00:33:19,517 --> 00:33:23,780
Rym: the scary neighborhoods are the places where all the windows are barred and no one is Outside.

473
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:31,490
Scott: Yeah See if no one lets the kids outside Then you can't let your kid outside and be the only one because then it actually is dangerous.

474
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:39,709
Scott: There's not a bunch of kids, you know running about having fun to scare away criminals and you know Unwanted folks plus kids watch out for each other.

475
00:33:40,031 --> 00:33:52,430
Scott: Yeah, if but if everyone lets the kids outside and you have this whole block full of kids, even if it's just five kids No one's gonna come and try to molest one of the kids and you can't get all five of them.

476
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:53,654
Scott: Yeah, and what?

477
00:33:53,714 --> 00:33:57,990
Scott: just even if one of them is smart, you're okay, but little Billy might skin his knee.

478
00:33:58,252 --> 00:33:59,910
Rym: We have to protect him from the dangerous world.

479
00:34:02,071 --> 00:34:03,738
Scott: No one ever died from skinning their knee.

480
00:34:04,139 --> 00:34:06,789
Rym: in fact, oh, yeah people have died from that sort of thing.

481
00:34:07,451 --> 00:34:08,614
Scott: Well, they deserve to die.

482
00:34:08,635 --> 00:34:10,761
Rym: I mean skinning your knee.

483
00:34:10,781 --> 00:34:14,030
Rym: take that to this extreme like road rash from falling off a motorcycle.

484
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:17,380
Scott: Yeah, yeah, it's not skinning your knee from a bike crash.

485
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,244
Rym: That's skinning your knee.

486
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:23,464
Rym: It's just skinning a lot of other things - It's not to say Road rash you.

487
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:29,793
Rym: yeah I think I told that story where I skin my knees real bad to the bone and I'd ride my bike home and I was A little kid.

488
00:34:30,338 --> 00:34:33,215
Rym: Yeah, my grandma was home and she screamed Hmm.

489
00:34:33,397 --> 00:34:35,833
Rym: Yeah trail of blood You know what?

490
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:36,978
Rym: Those were good times.

491
00:34:37,058 --> 00:34:39,549
Rym: I think back upon all the times I hurt myself fondly.

492
00:34:40,072 --> 00:34:42,590
Rym: Yeah, because I never hurt myself bad enough to die.

493
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:45,608
Rym: I'm still here and the kids that did hurt themselves bad enough to die.

494
00:34:46,172 --> 00:34:49,610
Rym: I hate to say it, but actually I don't know anyone who hurt themselves and died.

495
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:57,562
Rym: I know some people who broke bones and they mostly deserved it and I think they were slightly smarter as yeah I never broke a bone, but I hurt myself plenty of times.

496
00:34:57,642 --> 00:34:59,650
Rym: I broke my pinky toe twice same pinky toe.

497
00:35:00,591 --> 00:35:02,358
Scott: Oh, no, I did but I broke my collarbone.

498
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:05,790
Rym: Yeah, I also had a bee sting that pinky bone, you know.

499
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:06,858
Scott: And that's how kids learn.

500
00:35:06,898 --> 00:35:08,550
Scott: is you get safe to do this?

501
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:14,167
Scott: It's not safe to do that and maybe there are things that aren't safe to do But then kids build the skills to do it safely.

502
00:35:14,187 --> 00:35:22,779
Scott: I remember We used to like, you know You have a you have a playground and one kid would do something on the playground and all the other kids who did have never Done that would go.

503
00:35:23,044 --> 00:35:24,413
Scott: Whoo Like?

504
00:35:24,454 --> 00:35:26,079
Scott: maybe he would like.

505
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:31,094
Scott: I had the standard swing set, you know a slide on one end and lucky

506
00:35:31,114 --> 00:35:31,977
Rym: bars down the middle a

507
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:43,078
Scott: couple swings a swinging bar, you know, and You know one of my friends went up there and he walked across the top of it Which is definitely not the purpose of it.

508
00:35:43,218 --> 00:35:46,430
Scott: now if he would have fallen he might have hurt himself pretty bad.

509
00:35:46,691 --> 00:35:52,370
Rym: Oh, he might have done like what that kid in the trampoline basketball dunk video did something similar.

510
00:35:53,634 --> 00:35:56,284
Scott: It was pretty much a 10-foot drop and then grass and dirt.

511
00:35:56,987 --> 00:35:57,870
Scott: That's what would have happened.

512
00:35:58,571 --> 00:36:10,187
Scott: So, you know we saw him do this and we're like, whoa Now, you know I went up to try and do it cuz that's what kids did in those days Unlike the wusses of today and I was like, oh shit this too dangerous.

513
00:36:10,248 --> 00:36:14,122
Scott: I stopped doing it But then eventually I could do it.

514
00:36:14,142 --> 00:36:16,833
Scott: I Didn't hurt myself.

515
00:36:17,054 --> 00:36:24,966
Rym: Yeah, like our thing was in my elementary school Green Elementary We had really tall swings like old-school giant ass swings.

516
00:36:25,006 --> 00:36:26,050
Rym: They were really big.

517
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,418
Scott: Yeah, like big swings with the big chains.

518
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:34,641
Rym: Yeah, just a piece of rubber between two long ass chains Yep, and none of that plastic over the chains or anything.

519
00:36:34,661 --> 00:36:35,445
Rym: It was just a chain.

520
00:36:35,525 --> 00:36:36,550
Rym: Yeah, there's some rust there.

521
00:36:36,931 --> 00:36:38,194
Scott: Yep, that's the stuff.

522
00:36:38,455 --> 00:36:50,648
Rym: now when I remember when recess came everyone would line up at the door and then they blow the whistle Which meant it's recess time and you would bolt like high hell because there were only like 20 swings and there were like 400 kids.

523
00:36:51,971 --> 00:36:53,922
Scott: Whoa, they let all of them out at once if you.

524
00:36:53,942 --> 00:36:56,742
Rym: well, I don't know how many they allowed at once I don't remember but crazy.

525
00:36:56,782 --> 00:36:57,670
Rym: It was a huge playground.

526
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:05,350
Rym: There's all sorts of other stuff to do and there were other swings But there were 20 of these like big swings and when you got on one of those bastards you didn't leave.

527
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,958
Rym: Now some kids would just swing normal like.

528
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:17,629
Rym: but then there were the daredevils who would either jump off Which I often did or they'd try to pull a Tarzan thing where they jump off and then try to like Tarzan himself back.

529
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:20,553
Scott: Oh, yeah That's dangerous.

530
00:37:20,574 --> 00:37:21,357
Rym: That was awesome.

531
00:37:21,417 --> 00:37:24,630
Rym: Yeah, it is now the time when it got really interesting was one.

532
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,036
Rym: There were kids who would run the gauntlet.

533
00:37:26,056 --> 00:37:28,949
Rym: Yeah, I think you can figure out what the gauntlet was.

534
00:37:30,292 --> 00:37:31,768
Rym: Many a kid got pooned.

535
00:37:33,857 --> 00:37:34,889
Rym: It was all in good fun.

536
00:37:35,171 --> 00:37:46,530
Rym: Yeah, but the worst thing was some people realized that I don't remember what they called the game But once you got swinging pretty much at the maximum level of swinging because now there's that point at which you really can't get higher.

537
00:37:46,732 --> 00:37:50,769
Scott: Yeah, you're pretty much doing the whole 178 degrees.

538
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:56,633
Rym: Yeah Like you get up like just above the bar and you go up so high that you kind of fall a little bit before the Chain catches.

539
00:37:56,694 --> 00:38:01,578
Scott: Yeah, you go up so high the chain kind of goes lax And you know what.

540
00:38:01,598 --> 00:38:05,133
Scott: you're not keeping the chain taut for the whole Swing.

541
00:38:05,434 --> 00:38:09,370
Rym: and I learned as a kid right away that once that starts happening don't try to swing higher.

542
00:38:09,771 --> 00:38:11,337
Scott: No, because you will die.

543
00:38:11,357 --> 00:38:14,510
Rym: Yeah, you always heard the stories of he's gonna go over the bar.

544
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,175
Rym: Did you hear what happened to Brian?

545
00:38:16,477 --> 00:38:18,182
Rym: He went over the bar.

546
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:20,250
Scott: No one's ever gone over the bar.

547
00:38:20,591 --> 00:38:23,522
Rym: I kid almost went over the bar and he broke his neck in my elementary school.

548
00:38:23,823 --> 00:38:25,510
Rym: Oh, yeah, he was okay.

549
00:38:25,651 --> 00:38:27,670
Rym: I mean he broke his neck, but it didn't sever the spine.

550
00:38:27,932 --> 00:38:30,630
Rym: He just had to wear this terrible monstrosity for many months.

551
00:38:30,951 --> 00:38:37,010
Rym: Yeah, he got up like like a hundred and sixty hundred and seventy degrees and then just kind of fell on his head.

552
00:38:37,652 --> 00:38:38,858
Rym: Oh, it was terrible.

553
00:38:38,879 --> 00:38:39,401
Scott: Uh-huh.

554
00:38:39,823 --> 00:38:41,089
Rym: No one ever tried that shit again.

555
00:38:42,691 --> 00:38:56,526
Scott: Cuz you know if you don't let kids swing then they don't know how high they can swing and if they don't see it See you swing this high babies Then you won't realize that you could possibly break your neck someday.

556
00:38:56,546 --> 00:38:58,474
Rym: Yep Yep.

557
00:38:58,514 --> 00:38:58,716
Scott: Yep.

558
00:38:58,737 --> 00:38:58,918
Scott: Yep.

559
00:38:58,939 --> 00:39:05,590
Scott: I Mean if you never get into a fight with anyone You don't know how to fight and if someday someone comes to kick your ass, you're fucked.

560
00:39:06,133 --> 00:39:08,123
Rym: Yeah, I got in a bunch of little fights when I was a kid.

561
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:09,269
Scott: I sure did too.

562
00:39:09,732 --> 00:39:11,019
Rym: Some of them were scrappy one time.

563
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:12,709
Rym: I got ambushed and punched in the balls.

564
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:16,823
Scott: It's like until you're punched in the face and you punch someone in the face.

565
00:39:17,164 --> 00:39:18,610
Scott: You don't know really how it goes.

566
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:26,010
Rym: Yep, you only need to do it once Yep, because one you realize if you don't punch right you'll hurt yourself more than you'll hurt them.

567
00:39:26,351 --> 00:39:32,309
Scott: And if all you know about punching is what you see on TV your impressions gonna be real wrong.

568
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:40,118
Rym: Yeah, you don't just wind up and pop a guy in the chin and then he goes down you start winding up and suddenly he's Wailing on you.

569
00:39:40,138 --> 00:39:45,672
Scott: Yeah, I think they should bring boxing back to Schools.

570
00:39:46,073 --> 00:39:47,678
Rym: if not boxing some martial art.

571
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:52,416
Scott: Well boxing is good because anyone can do it and it doesn't really you know It's not.

572
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,730
Scott: it's real simple.

573
00:39:54,511 --> 00:40:00,032
Rym: Yeah, the problem is you don't want to have kids do that a lot because boxing has a lot of long-term Consequences.

574
00:40:00,052 --> 00:40:01,156
Scott: you don't do it a lot.

575
00:40:01,237 --> 00:40:03,828
Scott: But the example is my bio teacher in 11th grade.

576
00:40:04,471 --> 00:40:09,000
Scott: I'll never forget that he told us this story Because there was some fight in the hallway and he's like.

577
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:11,030
Rym: I've actually already talked about this on the show.

578
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:11,955
Scott: That's I'm on the show.

579
00:40:11,975 --> 00:40:13,685
Rym: I'm pretty sure you told this story, but go ahead tell it again.

580
00:40:13,726 --> 00:40:14,470
Rym: Just tell the brief version.

581
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,177
Scott: I've told it to you.

582
00:40:15,278 --> 00:40:16,429
Scott: I don't know if I've told it on the show.

583
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:19,381
Rym: Yeah, I'm like 60/40 that you told it, but I don't know anyway nuts.

584
00:40:19,421 --> 00:40:20,606
Rym: We got whatever doesn't matter.

585
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:21,610
Scott: We have plenty new listeners.

586
00:40:21,831 --> 00:40:24,862
Scott: Yeah, we can reuse some stuff make clip show someday.

587
00:40:25,043 --> 00:40:27,070
Rym: Yeah, so we do this podcast, right?

588
00:40:28,091 --> 00:40:30,910
Scott: So it was a fight in the hallway and he said, you know, and he's an old guy.

589
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,476
Scott: So he's like back in my day.

590
00:40:32,717 --> 00:40:40,226
Scott: if two kids got into a fight the teachers would grab him pull him apart Bring him down to the gym put him in boxing gloves and throw him in the ring.

591
00:40:40,467 --> 00:40:43,409
Scott: then we take bets And I was like, yeah, that was great.

592
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:45,236
Scott: Two kids want to fight.

593
00:40:45,538 --> 00:40:47,910
Scott: they say none of this bullshit in the hallways.

594
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:50,209
Scott: You're gonna fight like real men and we're gonna see who really wins.

595
00:40:50,571 --> 00:40:58,730
Rym: Yep, or when I was in seventh grade and I got into a big fight with a kid and we you know beat on each Other for a while and the teachers came and they just kind of stood there until we finished.

596
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:09,978
Rym: You know kids fighting can't really hurt each other so much so they tend to just tire out and The fight becomes like you're kind of locked at the shoulders kind of pushing at each other and at that point after we tired ourselves off they broke it up.

597
00:41:11,048 --> 00:41:14,002
Rym: and Nowadays, if you get into a fight, they just fucking expel you.

598
00:41:14,403 --> 00:41:15,930
Rym: Yeah or call the police or suspend.

599
00:41:16,172 --> 00:41:16,675
Rym: You know they did.

600
00:41:17,138 --> 00:41:18,889
Rym: they suspended us both for one day.

601
00:41:19,272 --> 00:41:22,390
Rym: So for the next day we had to sit in the office next to each other quiet.

602
00:41:23,191 --> 00:41:26,396
Rym: I had that too and most of it was we totally got in a fight.

603
00:41:26,536 --> 00:41:28,198
Rym: Yeah, it was awesome.

604
00:41:28,358 --> 00:41:29,099
Rym: Yeah, it was.

605
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,105
Scott: I also had that.

606
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:34,534
Rym: so Can't do that anymore.

607
00:41:34,614 --> 00:41:42,290
Rym: zero tolerance policies, which we should do a whole show on even though we're all zero tolerance file 99% of zero tolerance policies are bullshit.

608
00:41:42,531 --> 00:41:49,765
Rym: They exist solely so that people in charge of the schools Don't have to make decisions because they're afraid that if they make a decision they might get sued.

609
00:41:50,045 --> 00:41:57,450
Scott: if they follow a policy then they Can't personally be sued and they should just make a policy besides the zero tolerance policy and follow that policy.

610
00:41:57,631 --> 00:42:00,210
Rym: The problem is they get then the school gets sued anyway and loses the money.

611
00:42:00,971 --> 00:42:04,770
Scott: Zero tolerance is like the safest way someone should sue the school for the zero tolerance policy.

612
00:42:05,373 --> 00:42:06,438
Rym: See the problem here is.

613
00:42:06,498 --> 00:42:08,730
Rym: it goes back to this parents are overprotective and stupid.

614
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:13,109
Rym: They a parent will sue the school at the drop of a hat now.

615
00:42:13,592 --> 00:42:17,210
Rym: So the school is so if they're more afraid of litigation than they are of kids hurting themselves.

616
00:42:17,834 --> 00:42:19,062
Rym: So there's an incentive.

617
00:42:19,183 --> 00:42:21,876
Rym: if a kid has problems Like say a kid is picked on.

618
00:42:22,217 --> 00:42:25,570
Rym: in the old days the school would help them or maybe they wouldn't but they do something.

619
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:30,020
Rym: Nowadays, there's a great incentive to kick that kid out of school.

620
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:35,797
Rym: the kid being picked on because he's the one that's most likely going To cause a problem either will not cause.

621
00:42:35,838 --> 00:42:37,122
Rym: the problem would be the problem.

622
00:42:37,483 --> 00:42:44,470
Rym: either his parents are gonna sue because he got picked on or He's gonna lash out or there'll be a fight and then there'll be a lawsuit or something.

623
00:42:44,631 --> 00:42:45,113
Rym: That's real.

624
00:42:45,133 --> 00:42:51,098
Scott: That's usually the reason that the kids who are picked on are Targeted by the administration.

625
00:42:51,118 --> 00:42:53,990
Scott: is because you know kids picking on each other?

626
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:54,632
Scott: Well, no one.

627
00:42:54,673 --> 00:43:01,042
Scott: there's no liability there if some kid says to another kid, you're stupid poopy pants You know that that happens all the time.

628
00:43:01,082 --> 00:43:02,370
Scott: That's no one has a problem with that.

629
00:43:02,511 --> 00:43:05,450
Rym: But then he's not a legal problem, but then that kid gets pissed off.

630
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:08,370
Scott: Yeah, but the kid who's picked on is the kid who throws the first punch?

631
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:09,495
Scott: So he's the problem.

632
00:43:09,897 --> 00:43:12,830
Scott: if they take all that there are plenty of bullies around the school.

633
00:43:13,272 --> 00:43:21,188
Scott: I mean if this one kid worthy of being picked up like Star Wars kid There's one Star Wars kid the whole class makes fun of Star Wars kid.

634
00:43:21,248 --> 00:43:23,556
Scott: together You can't.

635
00:43:23,617 --> 00:43:25,745
Scott: it's either the whole class or Star Wars kid.

636
00:43:25,905 --> 00:43:26,969
Scott: One of them has got to go.

637
00:43:28,212 --> 00:43:32,330
Scott: So it's very easy to just take all the loser kids out of your school.

638
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:36,227
Scott: There's maybe 20 of them per you know, I guess 500 kids.

639
00:43:37,811 --> 00:43:39,518
Scott: Maybe there's 20 kids being picked on.

640
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:42,068
Scott: just get rid of them and the rest of the school's fine.

641
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,466
Rym: now That's really a terrible precedent.

642
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:51,320
Rym: Yep I mean now not only are these kids kicked out of the school, even though they didn't do anything Yeah, and they're usually smarter kids.

643
00:43:51,641 --> 00:44:00,950
Rym: Yeah, they just may didn't do anything yet Yeah, but it's just the school is so afraid of litigation that they'll harm children in order to protect themselves from lawsuits.

644
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:01,461
Rym: Mm-hmm.

645
00:44:02,232 --> 00:44:03,057
Scott: But they have to do.

646
00:44:03,157 --> 00:44:04,626
Scott: is kids who are getting picked on.

647
00:44:04,786 --> 00:44:09,470
Scott: they have to Figure out why those kids are being picked on and get those kids to change their ways.

648
00:44:09,651 --> 00:44:12,730
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time people are being picked on for stupid reasons.

649
00:44:13,052 --> 00:44:15,410
Rym: Then you take care of that and you stop the bully somehow.

650
00:44:15,571 --> 00:44:16,937
Scott: Well, we think we talked.

651
00:44:16,957 --> 00:44:18,544
Scott: we had an old episode on bullying didn't we?

652
00:44:19,187 --> 00:44:19,650
Rym: Yeah, we did.

653
00:44:19,911 --> 00:44:27,129
Scott: I think the summary was if bullies cross the line then they're bad But if they don't cross the line then the picked on kid is doing something stupid.

654
00:44:27,169 --> 00:44:32,529
Rym: Yeah Well, I guess my I mean my main take on it is look at society You don't like if someone has.

655
00:44:33,551 --> 00:44:43,360
Rym: If someone has a silly belief like a stupid belief or does something stupid like say we're walking down the street and someone's like Yeah, or eggs cure cancer and they're smearing eggs into their hair.

656
00:44:43,741 --> 00:44:45,667
Rym: Yeah, just to have a crazy example.

657
00:44:46,088 --> 00:44:46,730
Scott: and they believe it.

658
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:47,117
Scott: They're not.

659
00:44:47,219 --> 00:44:47,830
Scott: they're not lying.

660
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:49,096
Rym: No They have a right to believe that.

661
00:44:49,136 --> 00:44:54,921
Rym: they have a right to do whatever they want to do because it doesn't harm me that some Guys smashing eggs into his hair all day, but you know what?

662
00:44:55,403 --> 00:44:57,049
Rym: It's my right to make fun of him.

663
00:44:57,511 --> 00:45:02,430
Scott: Freedom of speech it you do not have a right to not be offended.

664
00:45:02,771 --> 00:45:06,541
Rym: In fact, I generally think that when it comes to children and young adults.

665
00:45:06,942 --> 00:45:14,367
Rym: It's a different situation because when you're that young Bullying and picking on can actually have an effect on your life and it's a bad thing.

666
00:45:14,427 --> 00:45:15,050
Rym: and kids are.

667
00:45:15,614 --> 00:45:17,429
Rym: Kids are kids and kids do their stupid things.

668
00:45:17,972 --> 00:45:22,870
Rym: So it's a whole different ballpark and you really have to you know deal with it in ways that are complicated.

669
00:45:23,856 --> 00:45:28,865
Rym: Once you're an adult If you get picked on as an adult that's there's nothing to be done about that.

670
00:45:29,166 --> 00:45:29,809
Rym: freedom of speech.

671
00:45:30,813 --> 00:45:37,772
Scott: see I'll go so far even to say that hate speech and What's the other?

672
00:45:37,973 --> 00:45:40,361
Scott: sexual harassment speech only speech.

673
00:45:40,601 --> 00:45:46,450
Scott: you know grabbing boobies is right out, you know Burning crosses on people's lawns and lynching people is right out.

674
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:52,030
Scott: Yeah, but saying you know, I guess I'll Jewish so I can say kike on the show and no one will think I'm a racist.

675
00:45:52,131 --> 00:45:53,769
Scott: You know saying hey you dirty kikes.

676
00:45:54,971 --> 00:45:58,085
Scott: Or saying you know, what was I?

677
00:45:58,246 --> 00:45:59,170
Scott: Oh sexual harassment.

678
00:45:59,892 --> 00:46:01,075
Scott: Hey, those are some nice knockers.

679
00:46:01,095 --> 00:46:09,110
Scott: He got there mind if I grab him sometime, you know saying that it's okay to say that shit It's at least I say it's okay to say that.

680
00:46:09,571 --> 00:46:10,173
Rym: I mean it may.

681
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:18,344
Rym: it may not be okay in terms of it's tell lightness or it's not polite or it's just a Stupid and if someone says that to you, you can slap them.

682
00:46:18,485 --> 00:46:19,349
Scott: got no problem with that.

683
00:46:19,711 --> 00:46:22,989
Rym: I mean basically people have a right to be a stupid asshole or an ignorant prick.

684
00:46:23,492 --> 00:46:26,223
Scott: Yeah, freedom of speech means the right to say stupid shit.

685
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,830
Scott: No one cares if you say smart shit.

686
00:46:28,133 --> 00:46:33,189
Scott: No one's ever gonna argue with you if you say something Unless you're a stupid person.

687
00:46:34,012 --> 00:46:34,935
Rym: Yeah to you.

688
00:46:35,396 --> 00:46:35,957
Rym: evolution.

689
00:46:36,038 --> 00:46:36,358
Scott: Yeah.

690
00:46:36,659 --> 00:46:40,570
Scott: No, but the point is people are only gonna get mad at speech.

691
00:46:41,072 --> 00:46:46,430
Scott: That is disruptive speech and freedom of speech isn't the right to say the normal speech.

692
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:50,086
Scott: You don't need a right to say normal speech because it's not under attack.

693
00:46:50,146 --> 00:46:51,070
Scott: It doesn't need protection.

694
00:46:51,371 --> 00:46:54,710
Scott: You have to protect the stupid evil fucktard speech.

695
00:46:55,012 --> 00:46:57,830
Rym: I forget who it was who said this but I think it was a Supreme Court justice.

696
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:12,410
Rym: I'm pretty sure I quoted this on the show a while ago but there was someone who said I gave a long write-up of free speech and the ramifications and Basically, he came to the conclusion that freedom any freedom comes with risk.

697
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:17,069
Rym: If you give people the freedom to do X then there is the risk that doing X will cause why?

698
00:47:18,132 --> 00:47:23,126
Rym: If you give people the freedom of speech there's the chance that they'll use that freedom to do stupid horrible things.

699
00:47:23,286 --> 00:47:27,315
Rym: Mm-hmm now the Issue with a free society.

700
00:47:27,475 --> 00:47:34,350
Rym: Is that a free society is one wherein not where in people let anything happen Or where it's just crazy anarchy?

701
00:47:35,156 --> 00:47:45,350
Rym: It's a society where people Accept the risk of the freedoms they want and if they cannot accept the risk of a certain freedom Then they agree to give up that freedom to alleviate the risk.

702
00:47:45,972 --> 00:47:50,104
Rym: If you accept the risk of a freedom you have to accept the consequences.

703
00:47:50,565 --> 00:47:51,949
Rym: There's really no middle ground there.

704
00:47:53,572 --> 00:47:58,450
Scott: It seems like people want the freedom to say everything they want except the things they don't like.

705
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:00,270
Rym: Yeah, that's not cool.

706
00:48:00,551 --> 00:48:09,530
Rym: now if you don't like the idea of freedom of speech or you don't like the ID Risks of having freedom of speech you can go somewhere where there isn't freedom of speech.

707
00:48:09,771 --> 00:48:10,815
Rym: Yeah, I mean people should be.

708
00:48:10,835 --> 00:48:13,104
Rym: I should have the right to create a society for themselves.

709
00:48:13,144 --> 00:48:19,407
Rym: where you don't have a freedom if they Really are fear the consequences of that but you can't force me into your society.

710
00:48:19,427 --> 00:48:25,350
Scott: Yes You can if you don't like saying fuck you can you know?

711
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:30,950
Scott: Never say fuck and you can go somewhere where people don't say fuck make a little commune or whatever.

712
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:31,472
Scott: I don't care.

713
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:35,169
Scott: as long as you don't prevent me from saying fuck then I don't care.

714
00:48:35,631 --> 00:48:38,200
Scott: But if you want to prevent me from saying fuck well, fuck you.

715
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:42,696
Rym: in regards to saying fuck this happened a long time ago But it wasn't national news.

716
00:48:42,756 --> 00:48:46,070
Rym: It was just local news, but it made me very happy about my home state of Michigan.

717
00:48:46,891 --> 00:48:56,550
Rym: There was a case that went to the Michigan State Supreme Court many years ago where a guy was canoeing I think it was at a Belle Isle or somewhere and he flipped his canoe over.

718
00:48:57,271 --> 00:48:59,339
Rym: So he basically said fuck fuck fuck shit.

719
00:48:59,439 --> 00:48:59,761
Rym: Damn it.

720
00:48:59,821 --> 00:49:00,263
Rym: Son of a bitch.

721
00:49:00,323 --> 00:49:02,130
Rym: Fuck fuck like the stream of obscenities.

722
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:04,679
Scott: I would have said that if I put my canoe over now.

723
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,853
Rym: there were some parents with kids on the shore who overheard there.

724
00:49:08,893 --> 00:49:13,046
Rym: there was a law that you can't swear in public an old law.

725
00:49:13,532 --> 00:49:23,255
Rym: So they the parents got this guy arrested and there was this whole thing and in the end it got taken all the way up to the Supreme Court of the state and The Supreme Court rules kind

726
00:49:23,295 --> 00:49:26,285
Scott: of confusing because in New York the Supreme Court is the first court.

727
00:49:26,586 --> 00:49:27,610
Scott: Yeah, it's fucked up.

728
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:29,569
Scott: Don't don't ignore New York courts.

729
00:49:30,152 --> 00:49:33,710
Scott: Ignore that when the Supreme Court is the first court, you know, something's wrong.

730
00:49:33,992 --> 00:49:42,470
Rym: Yeah, this was the highest court in the state of Michigan There you go, and it couldn't go higher than that unless it became a constitutional issue Which it didn't because this court ruled correctly.

731
00:49:43,092 --> 00:49:54,130
Rym: They ruled either unanimously or almost unanimously that the Supreme Court precedent that obscene speech Which is one of the few types of speech that can be regulated by the government.

732
00:49:55,449 --> 00:50:07,579
Rym: It Obscene speech is only considered obscene if it is if it one appeals to a prurient nature in man and to Conveys no meaning Or conveys no actual idea.

733
00:50:08,302 --> 00:50:16,389
Rym: and they ruled that this man was conveying his anger And therefore there is nothing wrong with what he said and there can be no law abridging his right to say those words.

734
00:50:17,572 --> 00:50:21,130
Scott: Everyone should just watch the Penn and Teller bullshit episode about cursing.

735
00:50:21,614 --> 00:50:30,310
Rym: Yeah, I mean bear in mind the Penn and Teller show is great But it's definitely entertainment and they don't always I don't know fully vet out their opinions.

736
00:50:30,471 --> 00:50:32,078
Scott: Some episodes are better than others.

737
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:34,490
Scott: Yeah the episode about how college is no good.

738
00:50:34,792 --> 00:50:44,256
Scott: They spent two minutes talking about how college is no good Which I think is a pretty weak argument and spent the rest of the episode talking about how Diversity in college is stupid.

739
00:50:44,376 --> 00:50:47,405
Scott: Yeah, which they basically were redundant many times.

740
00:50:47,525 --> 00:50:48,970
Rym: or their show where they took aid.

741
00:50:49,391 --> 00:50:59,210
Rym: I mean, we are very freedom libertarian, but they took a very pro smoking stance in one of their episodes Yeah, which honestly I I mean I I agree with their ideals.

742
00:50:59,631 --> 00:51:04,810
Rym: The problem is the evidence they used to back it up was kind of flimsy and proven wrong later.

743
00:51:05,512 --> 00:51:10,970
Scott: Yeah, and the you know, their argument was like you can't prove that secondhand smoke causes cancer.

744
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:11,432
Rym: You know what?

745
00:51:11,573 --> 00:51:13,946
Rym: I can prove the secondhand smoke smells like an asshole.

746
00:51:14,348 --> 00:51:25,168
Scott: Yeah You can smoke all you want as long as the smoke never goes anywhere near me because it doesn't matter because cancer it's Unpleasant and you cannot force your unpleasantness on me.

747
00:51:25,188 --> 00:51:25,932
Rym: now You know what?

748
00:51:26,033 --> 00:51:33,085
Rym: I have a very simple solution to this and if it ever becomes an issue It's not an issue in New York State anymore because they made smoking in most places illegal.

749
00:51:33,125 --> 00:51:35,979
Rym: still sucks on the streets Yeah, but you know what?

750
00:51:36,039 --> 00:51:37,949
Rym: That's fine because I can eat in my restaurants now.

751
00:51:38,158 --> 00:51:40,720
Rym: Yeah That's the only thing I hate about going to the Jersey Shore.

752
00:51:40,961 --> 00:51:45,181
Rym: as I walk into a restaurant and they say smoking or not And I look at it for a second like what?

753
00:51:45,925 --> 00:51:49,095
Rym: Oh, right Jersey Mm-hmm.

754
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:50,749
Scott: Well, not New York.

755
00:51:50,810 --> 00:52:05,149
Rym: Yeah though a bunch of other states have banned smoking and those states and actually a lot of states haven't banned it but most Good restaurants ban it on their own anyway, because it keeps riffraff out and it keeps generally the people that suck out.

756
00:52:06,152 --> 00:52:11,550
Scott: It's where the smoking is so expensive and the only people most people do it are poor like that homeless lady on our street.

757
00:52:12,011 --> 00:52:15,922
Scott: It's like are they poor because they're smoking and spending all their money on it?

758
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:18,950
Scott: or are they smoking because their lives are poor and shitty?

759
00:52:19,494 --> 00:52:19,776
Scott: You know?

760
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:21,790
Scott: and then the rich people who smoke what are they thinking?

761
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:28,495
Rym: Oh, they're only smoking like expensive cigars, but my solution to the whole debate about secondhand smoke is very simple All right, fine.

762
00:52:28,796 --> 00:52:31,730
Rym: You can have your right to smoke cigarettes in public places around other people.

763
00:52:32,552 --> 00:52:37,587
Rym: I then have my right to burn my sulfur sticks in public places around you.

764
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:40,109
Rym: It's no different It doesn't harm you in any way.

765
00:52:40,993 --> 00:52:44,805
Scott: Yeah, I can just carry my stink bombs around while I wear my gas mask.

766
00:52:44,825 --> 00:52:46,430
Rym: Yeah, I can choose not to shower.

767
00:52:47,732 --> 00:52:49,203
Scott: Well, goddamn hippies.

768
00:52:49,788 --> 00:52:58,370
Scott: Yeah Yeah, you can choose to wear a cologne that smells terrible not showering as other effects such as spreading of disease.

769
00:52:58,753 --> 00:53:00,530
Scott: Yeah, so that's a little different.

770
00:53:00,831 --> 00:53:06,130
Rym: But I I would love to see a movement of punk kids going around to smokers in public places burning sulfur sticks.

771
00:53:06,592 --> 00:53:08,382
Scott: Let's get some fucking sulfur sticks and do it.

772
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:09,970
Rym: Well, I don't want to smell like sulfur.

773
00:53:10,091 --> 00:53:17,330
Scott: I know what we do is when there's a group of smokers standing around like a door of a building We just throw a sulfur stick on the ground and keep walking.

774
00:53:17,651 --> 00:53:24,942
Rym: Actually, we should do it Michael Moore style where we have a hidden camera and we film it and we pay punk kids to walk Over and stand there with the sulfur kit.

775
00:53:25,245 --> 00:53:27,516
Rym: Ooh Yeah, you know what?

776
00:53:27,556 --> 00:53:33,822
Rym: I think once we get that video camera, we'll have to do a few video podcasts of Michael Moore type crap, we're gonna.

777
00:53:33,842 --> 00:53:35,290
Scott: we're gonna have to buy a video camera.

778
00:53:35,471 --> 00:53:38,201
Rym: Yeah, cuz we're real good at causing scenes.

779
00:53:38,763 --> 00:53:44,429
Scott: if anyone doesn't realize this If anyone is unaware is let's end this episode soon.

780
00:53:45,031 --> 00:53:50,850
Scott: There's the episode of the Simpsons where Homer is hanging with the hippies is like Ben and Jerry or something like that.

781
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:52,699
Scott: Yeah, and he drive.

782
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,690
Scott: they drive around town freaking squares.

783
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,114
Scott: That's what we do.

784
00:53:57,174 --> 00:53:58,258
Scott: We freak the squares.

785
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,848
Rym: Yeah, both both purposefully and by accident.

786
00:54:01,049 --> 00:54:02,992
Scott: Yes Yes, we do It's.

787
00:54:03,232 --> 00:54:10,579
Rym: it's one of our one of our favorite pastimes to do something weird in public and just watch people Not know how to deal with it.

788
00:54:10,659 --> 00:54:12,469
Scott: Are you wanting to end the episode with the things of the day?

789
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:20,996
Rym: Yeah, so so much for a short episode.

790
00:54:21,298 --> 00:54:29,109
Scott: Well, our original plan was to do an episode about Airlines and public transportation in that shit, but I guess that went out the window pretty quick.

791
00:54:29,551 --> 00:54:34,169
Rym: Yeah, but as a result since we did the main bit just now we'll do the things of the day and that's it.

792
00:54:34,814 --> 00:54:37,393
Scott: I don't even know what this episode was about All right.

793
00:54:37,473 --> 00:54:39,463
Rym: So my thing of the day is real quick.

794
00:54:39,524 --> 00:54:40,770
Rym: I don't really need to say much about it.

795
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:42,399
Rym: Remember, I'm the juggernaut bitch.

796
00:54:42,962 --> 00:54:44,209
Scott: on the juggernaut bitch.

797
00:54:44,892 --> 00:54:54,126
Rym: Well those guys because I thought I mean there was a lot of there were a lot of really clever jokes in that juggernaut bit How they were just masked by the fact that the audio is kind of terrible.

798
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:55,030
Rym: It was easy to miss it.

799
00:54:55,110 --> 00:55:00,206
Scott: Yeah they were mumbling a lot and sometimes the volume was too low and I couldn't tell what they were saying.

800
00:55:00,246 --> 00:55:05,690
Scott: and sometimes what they were saying Was very quick or it cut away and it couldn't really make out the joke.

801
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:09,089
Scott: But if you pay attention, there's a lot of funny jokes in there.

802
00:55:09,611 --> 00:55:19,362
Rym: so they've gotten together again and they're going to start doing a whole bunch of episodes and they've started now with part one of The you know X-men in space series.

803
00:55:19,382 --> 00:55:20,570
Rym: They're just gonna go through the whole thing.

804
00:55:20,731 --> 00:55:23,830
Rym: Oh, yeah, and the production values have increased significantly.

805
00:55:24,791 --> 00:55:27,921
Rym: The jokes are much better and they're right.

806
00:55:27,982 --> 00:55:30,450
Rym: There are a lot of really clever little quips in there.

807
00:55:30,936 --> 00:55:31,669
Scott: Yeah, but you know what?

808
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:37,710
Scott: I don't think it's gonna fly because you need the catchphrase and there's no new catchphrase.

809
00:55:38,292 --> 00:55:40,419
Rym: No, there are however funny scenes.

810
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:45,357
Scott: See that's really why all your base took off and stuff Like are you gonna use?

811
00:55:45,397 --> 00:55:51,848
Scott: you know didn't is because all your base had Catchphrases things that people could repeat and would repeat.

812
00:55:52,129 --> 00:55:54,859
Rym: Yep I mean you can have a thing like the juggernaut thing like.

813
00:55:54,960 --> 00:56:01,565
Rym: well that that has its own, you know, I'm the juggernaut bitch Yep, but this new one it's really funny, but it's not a gestalt.

814
00:56:01,585 --> 00:56:02,770
Rym: It's not portable.

815
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:05,500
Scott: It's like Simpsons sit without.

816
00:56:05,601 --> 00:56:06,604
Scott: I Caramba Simpsons.

817
00:56:06,645 --> 00:56:07,970
Scott: Wouldn't it be here that now?

818
00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:14,810
Rym: But anyway, I'm not gonna say much more about the juggernaut thing And I'm not going to make any more of my things of the day about this.

819
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:21,849
Rym: I just wanted to note to all of you out there that this is now a continuing series that I find hilarious in a terrible terrible way.

820
00:56:22,751 --> 00:56:23,613
Scott: Yep, all right.

821
00:56:23,693 --> 00:56:24,896
Scott: My thing today is pretty cool.

822
00:56:25,417 --> 00:56:28,465
Scott: Hey Rym if you could live in any structure.

823
00:56:28,726 --> 00:56:29,969
Scott: What structure would you live in?

824
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:39,999
Rym: Variety of structure I would live in some sort of interdimensional traveling Existing has known to exist some kind.

825
00:56:40,019 --> 00:56:40,822
Scott: There you go castle.

826
00:56:41,124 --> 00:56:42,690
Rym: You're waiting for the word castle, aren't you?

827
00:56:43,011 --> 00:56:45,328
Rym: That was I almost said manor house.

828
00:56:45,348 --> 00:56:45,630
Rym: You're lucky.

829
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:47,050
Rym: I said castle cars.

830
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:49,730
Scott: How could you want to live in a manor house instead of a cat?

831
00:56:49,730 --> 00:56:52,641
Rym: You know why cuz it sucks to heat and cool castles without magic.

832
00:56:52,861 --> 00:56:55,110
Rym: so unless you teach me some magic castles suck ass.

833
00:56:55,552 --> 00:56:59,249
Scott: Castles are awesome, and if you want a castle you can go to my thing of the day.

834
00:57:00,691 --> 00:57:05,750
Scott: It's a website with a bunch of castles that you can buy and live in if you really want to.

835
00:57:06,251 --> 00:57:07,415
Scott: Some of them actually look nice.

836
00:57:07,435 --> 00:57:10,205
Scott: They all seem to have pools instead of moats though.

837
00:57:10,586 --> 00:57:17,288
Scott: I don't know what's up with that But yeah If you want to live in a castle, there's the website to hit up.

838
00:57:17,952 --> 00:57:20,266
Scott: There's even a feudal castle which is wicked cool.

839
00:57:20,286 --> 00:57:25,421
Scott: check this thing out Frickin giant ass ballroom with a long table and the giant rug.

840
00:57:25,441 --> 00:57:28,910
Rym: I wouldn't feel comfortable in a place like that without a man servant.

841
00:57:29,971 --> 00:57:31,055
Scott: It comes with a man servant.

842
00:57:31,075 --> 00:57:32,198
Scott: That's he's right there.

843
00:57:32,479 --> 00:57:35,670
Scott: cuz see there's the guy playing golf, and he's peeing into the other guy's cup.

844
00:57:37,618 --> 00:57:40,409
Rym: His name would have to be either Norman or Alfred or I wouldn't deal with it.

845
00:57:40,891 --> 00:57:43,219
Scott: Yeah, you could name whatever you want is what you're paying him.

846
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:51,554
Scott: I see this or Fred this castle costs 26 million euros, so that's more than 26 million dollars isn't it?

847
00:57:51,814 --> 00:57:52,236
