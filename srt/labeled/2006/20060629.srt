9
00:00:51,777 --> 00:00:57,969
Scott: and if you just can't get enough listening to us talk about the same old stuff over and over Again, you should go listen to that.

10
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,857
Rym: Yeah, you have interviews us and half.

11
00:00:59,897 --> 00:01:02,970
Rym: We just kind of talk about an anime next and anime cons in general.

12
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:13,453
Scott: Yeah, it shows a pretty good show and if you're into geeky things And you just can't get enough podcasting as four nights a week is enough for you add him to your little podcast Subscribe you bit.

13
00:01:13,854 --> 00:01:23,864
Rym: Yeah, also we finally started making our promos which sometime over the next week I'm going to edit and put up which means you might start hearing promos from all the shows.

14
00:01:23,904 --> 00:01:25,730
Scott: We like all the crap.

15
00:01:26,413 --> 00:01:29,666
Rym: Yeah, we've done how many episodes we never did a promo I know isn't it crazy?

16
00:01:29,867 --> 00:01:30,570
Rym: it's about time.

17
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:35,450
Scott: It also might mean there might be an influx of a bunch of new people who hear our promo on other shows.

18
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:36,735
Rym: Yeah, unlike the previous.

19
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:38,503
Rym: I don't know like five influxes.

20
00:01:38,543 --> 00:01:44,470
Scott: We've had I know right We're just waiting for the one big influx where like our listenership quintuples.

21
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,195
Rym: If anything that might be.

22
00:01:46,276 --> 00:01:48,847
Rym: once we do our live show at Otakon, it might be yep.

23
00:01:49,811 --> 00:01:52,701
Rym: But anyway, as we promised today, we're going to be doing our.

24
00:01:53,103 --> 00:01:57,362
Rym: the listeners interview us episode At least the first of these.

25
00:01:57,403 --> 00:01:59,274
Rym: we might do it again sometime Mm-hmm.

26
00:01:59,576 --> 00:02:02,090
Scott: This is very easy to do when we get a whole bunch of more listeners.

27
00:02:02,512 --> 00:02:05,228
Scott: You know they have a whole enough new questions to ask us.

28
00:02:05,811 --> 00:02:11,636
Rym: Thus we'll be kind of quick on the news and things of the day mostly because one we want to fit as many of these Questions in as we can.

29
00:02:11,938 --> 00:02:12,119
Scott: Yep.

30
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,506
Scott: We're probably gonna do all of them.

31
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:14,269
Scott: If not most of them.

32
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:23,046
Rym: Yep, and two I kind of want to get to sleep because we're basically recording two and a half Times the number of pot the amount of podcast we usually record tonight.

33
00:02:23,086 --> 00:02:23,890
Scott: Yeah, we're going it.

34
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,877
Scott: We're doing a podcast a whole shit ton of it.

35
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:29,290
Scott: going to sleep waking up going to work going to the beach.

36
00:02:29,834 --> 00:02:31,208
Scott: That's our schedule right now.

37
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:34,213
Scott: Okay So, let's see.

38
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:34,795
Scott: start with the news.

39
00:02:34,935 --> 00:02:35,919
Scott: This is a quick news.

40
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,210
Scott: There's a guy named mark pilgrim who's been a crazy Mac user.

41
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,162
Scott: He's had using Mac since 1984 when I was two.

42
00:02:42,182 --> 00:02:43,548
Rym: He has a Mac tattoo.

43
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:47,989
Scott: Yeah He's a Mac Apple tattoo on his right bicep and he's owned 50 Macs at least.

44
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:56,795
Scott: He is switching to Ubuntu after becoming fed up with proprietary Mac file formats and the increasing use of DRM Technologies in the Mac OS.

45
00:02:57,317 --> 00:03:01,030
Scott: why didn't this guy talk and do this before we bought a Mac?

46
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,719
Rym: I want to try and get him on the show Bailey.

47
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,570
Scott: that might be a good idea.

48
00:03:04,731 --> 00:03:11,783
Rym: I would like to talk to him because I want to see what he has to say because honestly though I haven't used the Mac very thoroughly like.

49
00:03:11,803 --> 00:03:21,710
Rym: I haven't used it as my Daily computer for all my normal stuff, but I used it a lot for non podcasting And I liked it except for the podcasting bit, but I didn't put it to heavy use.

50
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,197
Rym: I'm really curious what this guy has to say.

51
00:03:23,217 --> 00:03:26,978
Scott: I don't know how much he's into the podcasting So, I don't know how much insight.

52
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,629
Rym: Well, no, I mean I want to ask him about everything else.

53
00:03:28,971 --> 00:03:29,856
Scott: Yeah, everything else.

54
00:03:29,896 --> 00:03:31,243
Scott: This guy seems like a good choice.

55
00:03:31,283 --> 00:03:32,530
Scott: Maybe we should send him an email.

56
00:03:33,492 --> 00:03:35,804
Rym: If anything, I'd like to get an email response that we could read.

57
00:03:36,026 --> 00:03:36,689
Scott: that would be cool, too.

58
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:39,990
Rym: Cuz I realize you know listening to anime world order which I want to plug again.

59
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:45,306
Rym: We even we plugged anime world order on the other podcast that we were talking on God.

60
00:03:45,487 --> 00:03:46,309
Scott: Yeah, just keep it.

61
00:03:46,711 --> 00:03:49,783
Scott: It's like we don't even plug people anymore.

62
00:03:49,864 --> 00:03:51,370
Scott: But you know, I mean we are not shills.

63
00:03:51,471 --> 00:03:54,910
Scott: We do not plug people, you know out of because we want them to be promoted.

64
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,139
Scott: We're not plug people because someone paid us or told us to.

65
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,020
Scott: yeah, like when we say we mentioned something else It's because we're mentioning it.

66
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,229
Scott: we just do it so often.

67
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:10,316
Rym: Yeah And like if we ever play a promo or anything You can we can guarantee to you that we would only ever play a promo if it was a show we actually do or would Listen to.

68
00:04:10,336 --> 00:04:11,349
Scott: yeah, you know what it is.

69
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,816
Scott: It's like if I mentioned the Simpsons.

70
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:15,890
Scott: people don't go all your shilling the Simpsons because it's a popular thing.

71
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,368
Scott: You don't shill it you just refer to it.

72
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:23,407
Scott: But when you refer to something very unpopular and amateur like a podcast it comes off as a promotion.

73
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:37,050
Rym: you see Plus also while we were just on this podcast We sent a long audio feedback to anime world order and they sent us a long email response Which I then responded to with a longer email response response.

74
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,763
Scott: And then I did a little uh, you know additional punch with a tiny email.

75
00:04:40,964 --> 00:04:42,570
Scott: Yep, relatively tiny email.

76
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:47,386
Rym: Yeah, only because as Scott said the beginning of his email Rym was very thorough.

77
00:04:47,406 --> 00:04:48,209
Scott: He was indeed.

78
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:52,865
Rym: Okay So you'll be able to hear us on at least two other podcasts in the near future.

79
00:04:52,885 --> 00:04:53,387
Rym: Mm-hmm.

80
00:04:54,451 --> 00:04:56,157
Rym: But anyway, uh, that's it.

81
00:04:56,217 --> 00:04:56,879
Rym: Let's do some news.

82
00:04:57,562 --> 00:04:58,184
Scott: We did the news.

83
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,950
Scott: My news was this guy who?

84
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:01,433
Rym: Alright, right.

85
00:05:01,995 --> 00:05:03,080
Rym: Yeah, we're going kind of quick here.

86
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,370
Scott: We want to get to the questions, which is the fun part.

87
00:05:05,751 --> 00:05:07,498
Rym: Yep, you know, I don't have a news.

88
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:17,668
Rym: I'll just note that the Supreme Court of the United States Basically just told the administration President Bush that they can't keep doing this Guantanamo Bay thing.

89
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,815
Scott: Oh That was obvious.

90
00:05:20,156 --> 00:05:21,582
Rym: Yeah, but it really you know what.

91
00:05:21,602 --> 00:05:24,470
Scott: you can just go out on the street and ask any guy and they'll tell You that that's obvious.

92
00:05:26,011 --> 00:05:42,910
Rym: what surprised me was the way the Supreme Court ruled on it and also the fact that Roberts who was appointed by Bush and I really was leery of him and his leanings and how how Loyal he would be to the administration versus how loyal he would be to his judicial ethics.

93
00:05:43,793 --> 00:05:52,350
Rym: And he actually bowed out of this decision because he sat on the lower court's ruling Mm-hmm, and I just I I have a little bit more respect for this guy as a result.

94
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:57,410
Scott: Yeah, I was leery of him too at first but as time goes on I'm less worried about him.

95
00:05:57,711 --> 00:05:59,938
Scott: Yeah, but well it remains to be seen.

96
00:06:00,018 --> 00:06:01,583
Rym: still I'm more leery of skeletal.

97
00:06:01,924 --> 00:06:03,610
Scott: Yes, but you know, what do you want?

98
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:12,905
Rym: Yeah, but I'll just note that this is actually probably very important news But the consequences and ramifications will not come out for many weeks or months.

99
00:06:13,185 --> 00:06:14,469
Scott: That's always the problem with things.

100
00:06:14,831 --> 00:06:17,542
Rym: Well mainly because the Supreme Court has no enforcement power.

101
00:06:17,622 --> 00:06:18,747
Rym: I mean a long time.

102
00:06:18,767 --> 00:06:19,490
Scott: Don't they have marshals?

103
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:23,349
Rym: They have federal marshals, but it doesn't quite work the way you might think it would work.

104
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:28,628
Rym: I mean if anyone isn't really familiar with American history, there is a point where Andrew Jackson who?

105
00:06:30,553 --> 00:06:40,170
Rym: I honestly have a very low opinion of this man, though I have a high opinion of the fact that I have a high opinion of his Testicles, yeah, I have a low opinion of his ideas.

106
00:06:40,832 --> 00:06:41,755
Rym: Yeah, it's like he did.

107
00:06:42,016 --> 00:06:45,850
Rym: he was really good at doing things, but the things he did were bad.

108
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:54,910
Scott: Yeah, it's like someone who's you know knows how to get the job done and has the balls to just do the job But at the same time what his the job he tries to do is stupid.

109
00:06:55,375 --> 00:07:04,609
Rym: Well to make a long story short He wanted to wipe out the Native Americans in an area and he wanted to do something with like this National bank business all sorts of bad stuff.

110
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:08,790
Rym: well It was real bad bad stuff or at least things that weren't really so constitutional.

111
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:10,115
Rym: Yeah, and the Supreme Court.

112
00:07:10,235 --> 00:07:14,350
Rym: and John Marshall the head of the Supreme Court said the best Supreme Court justice ever.

113
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:16,438
Rym: He said no, you can't do that.

114
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:17,722
Rym: It is unconstitutional.

115
00:07:17,762 --> 00:07:18,565
Rym: the Supreme Court ruled.

116
00:07:18,585 --> 00:07:24,410
Rym: I think almost unanimously and Andrew Jackson said the famous words John Marshall has made his decision.

117
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,316
Rym: Let's see him and force it.

118
00:07:26,778 --> 00:07:30,974
Scott: yep, and the only way he can do that is with US marshals of course back Then he couldn't.

119
00:07:31,095 --> 00:07:33,710
Rym: so Jackson just marched the army out and killed all the Indians.

120
00:07:34,511 --> 00:07:39,268
Scott: Yep, it was a dark day in American history very dark, and now he's on the $20 bill.

121
00:07:39,288 --> 00:07:39,770
Scott: Andrew Jackson.

122
00:07:40,151 --> 00:07:41,315
Rym: Yeah, funny how that works.

123
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:42,478
Rym: Abraham Lincoln's on money.

124
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:43,441
Rym: He was kind of a cock.

125
00:07:43,943 --> 00:07:45,448
Rym: Thomas Jefferson got dicked with a $2 bill.

126
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,197
Scott: Yeah, Thomas Jefferson is like no money.

127
00:07:48,237 --> 00:07:50,344
Rym: What the hell Ben Franklin's okay?

128
00:07:50,645 --> 00:07:51,528
Scott: Yeah, he's on the hundred.

129
00:07:51,568 --> 00:07:52,190
Scott: That's that's cool.

130
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,076
Rym: He's on the big bill.

131
00:07:53,238 --> 00:07:54,930
Rym: Yep course then we got like grant.

132
00:07:55,913 --> 00:07:56,917
Rym: What a grant ever do?

133
00:07:57,499 --> 00:07:57,961
Scott: I don't know.

134
00:07:58,141 --> 00:07:59,988
Scott: didn't they have $50 bills before grant?

135
00:08:00,008 --> 00:08:00,450
Scott: who was on it?

136
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:04,085
Scott: Then I don't know they should take grant off and put on Teddy Roosevelt.

137
00:08:04,246 --> 00:08:05,230
Rym: Yeah, Teddy Roosevelt's the man.

138
00:08:05,491 --> 00:08:07,788
Rym: Yeah, no he should be on something weird like the three dollar at 80 cent.

139
00:08:08,131 --> 00:08:08,917
Scott: They should be on the 50.

140
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:11,360
Scott: I'm telling you the 50 just sings.

141
00:08:11,421 --> 00:08:25,798
Scott: Teddy to me All right things of the day What you got all right.

142
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:31,350
Rym: uh I didn't really have anything good for today And I thought about just skipping things of the day and getting right to the questions.

143
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:42,870
Rym: But Scott had a decent thing of the day, so I came up with something I almost made my thing of the day the picture of Lisa and James's new baby bunnies because they're adorable even though you can only see a tiny ball of fur.

144
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:45,217
Scott: Yeah, they're just indistinguishable balls of fuzz.

145
00:08:45,538 --> 00:08:47,183
Rym: so I'll make that my thing of the day once.

146
00:08:47,244 --> 00:08:49,190
Rym: They're more recognizable as bunnies.

147
00:08:50,131 --> 00:08:52,390
Rym: But instead I was poking around in the internet.

148
00:08:52,491 --> 00:09:01,450
Rym: I actually searched for Hitler in Google video just to see if anything funny would come up And I saw something that looked like it was gonna be funny like someone voiced over Hitler funnily.

149
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,014
Rym: But it just petered out and wasn't.

150
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:08,108
Rym: and then I found the entirety of one of my favorite Monty Python sketches ever mr.

151
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,560
Rym: Hilta, that's an excellent sketch yes, and I mr..

152
00:09:11,721 --> 00:09:12,685
Scott: Hilta escape.

153
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:15,597
Rym: Hi, Kay.

154
00:09:15,778 --> 00:09:17,510
Rym: That's a map of Stalingrad.

155
00:09:19,455 --> 00:09:20,446
Scott: You got the wrong map.

156
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:24,300
Rym: I Was never head of the Gestapo.

157
00:09:24,621 --> 00:09:25,484
Rym: yeah, it's just.

158
00:09:25,564 --> 00:09:26,447
Rym: it's really.

159
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:27,210
Rym: you've never seen.

160
00:09:27,412 --> 00:09:27,795
Rym: I mean a lot.

161
00:09:27,836 --> 00:09:29,290
Rym: everyone's seen the Monty Python movies.

162
00:09:29,853 --> 00:09:33,068
Rym: I know a lot of people who have never actually seen Monty Python's Flying Circus.

163
00:09:33,309 --> 00:09:39,952
Rym: whoa If any of you out there have never seen any Monty Python's Flying Circus not just the movies But Flying Circus.

164
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,617
Rym: watch my thing of the day.

165
00:09:41,857 --> 00:09:44,243
Rym: It's got Japanese subtitles in case someone wants that.

166
00:09:44,564 --> 00:09:45,607
Rym: but it's just.

167
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:46,890
Rym: it's hilarious.

168
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:48,376
Rym: I can't really say anything.

169
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:50,023
Scott: Japanese not Chinese.

170
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:50,344
Rym: Yes.

171
00:09:50,405 --> 00:09:51,710
Rym: I'm sure because I saw hiragana.

172
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:55,030
Scott: Okay, my thing day is an awesome really quick video.

173
00:09:55,692 --> 00:09:56,956
Scott: You know those firecrackers.

174
00:09:57,016 --> 00:09:57,237
Scott: they were.

175
00:09:57,257 --> 00:10:04,550
Scott: there's a string and you light the string and it goes through the firecrackers And they snap off in rapid succession as the fuse burns.

176
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,950
Scott: You know it's like crack crack crack crack crack crack crack crack crack crack crack in a line.

177
00:10:08,211 --> 00:10:08,876
Rym: Yep, like sometimes.

178
00:10:08,897 --> 00:10:10,710
Rym: I'd tear those apart to get a bunch of individual fire.

179
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,630
Scott: Yeah, you usually take get a big roll of it, and you tear it up.

180
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:18,681
Scott: You know it's like sets of like 20. you light it you throw it And then it cracks 20 times in a row.

181
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:19,768
Scott: you know that sort of thing.

182
00:10:20,973 --> 00:10:29,683
Scott: some guys took a roll of 16,000 of these things and they rolled it up real tight and they let the end of it dangle about a foot down off the.

183
00:10:29,783 --> 00:10:34,800
Scott: you know the rest of the roll and they lit it and Ran away, and it starts to go as you expect.

184
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,328
Scott: you know crack crack crack crack crack crack crack crack crack crack crack crack crack crack.

185
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:45,295
Scott: And as it gets closer to the actual roll not only does it go around the spiral But it actually starts.

186
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:59,152
Scott: you know each firecracker sets off all the adjacent ones and there is 16,000 of them and it gets crazy And I must say it is perhaps one of the greatest firecracker displays of our time It's.

187
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:00,377
Rym: I didn't really expect it.

188
00:11:00,457 --> 00:11:06,022
Rym: I thought it was just gonna Peter around and be a normal dumb video and It's it's amazing.

189
00:11:06,043 --> 00:11:06,749
Rym: It's inferno.

190
00:11:07,812 --> 00:11:09,969
Scott: Yeah, that's basically the only words I can use to describe it.

191
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:15,530
Rym: But anyway as we promised today is the ask Rym and Scott episode.

192
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,709
Scott: Hooray, this is gonna be fun a lot of fun.

193
00:11:19,393 --> 00:11:19,875
Scott: We should do that.

194
00:11:19,895 --> 00:11:22,790
Scott: wish you could do it more often, but people run out of interesting questions.

195
00:11:23,171 --> 00:11:28,136
Rym: Yep, even though I gotta make fun of a few people's questions because they weren't the best questions Well, we'll do it.

196
00:11:28,237 --> 00:11:32,600
Rym: as the questions come yep And I think we're just gonna take them in a semi random order.

197
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:38,570
Rym: and this will be an interesting thing because usually for anyone Who's noticed we don't really like when we get listener feedback?

198
00:11:38,872 --> 00:11:42,269
Rym: We tend to just say what like what the gist of what they said was and then talk about it.

199
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:55,239
Rym: but every other radio show and Podcast out there actually reads the text of the emails they get or they get more voicemails and feedbacks Which I'm thinking about getting a pay for voicemail service.

200
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:57,466
Scott: That doesn't suck like the one we had.

201
00:11:57,526 --> 00:12:01,260
Rym: that failed that's broken But the phone number is still in our closing music.

202
00:12:01,381 --> 00:12:02,506
Rym: So we hope you're not calling it.

203
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,035
Scott: Yeah But yeah, we're.

204
00:12:05,076 --> 00:12:11,369
Scott: I'm thinking about paying for a real voicemail service Maybe with a cool phone number like something something something geek or something like that.

205
00:12:11,811 --> 00:12:15,627
Rym: Of course, you can always just email us feedback at GeekNights at front row.

206
00:12:15,648 --> 00:12:18,499
Scott: crew calm Yeah, but some people don't know how to make an mp3.

207
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:20,527
Rym: I am I am you know who you are.

208
00:12:20,547 --> 00:12:24,888
Rym: Yeah So we're just gonna handle these in kind of random order.

209
00:12:24,908 --> 00:12:28,017
Scott: and Well, no particular order not random ordering.

210
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:40,576
Scott: if we don't answer your question or we didn't get to it or whatever We're sorry, just say so in the forums or via email and we will send you either an email response or a forum response Or we'll make fun of you or make fun of you.

211
00:12:40,596 --> 00:12:44,430
Rym: Alright, so I guess Scott you can start just pick one the pick one.

212
00:12:44,611 --> 00:12:46,870
Scott: Hey, yeah, I'm gonna start at the top of the list because it's easier.

213
00:12:47,211 --> 00:12:52,830
Scott: All right, your opinion on Joan and Vasquez and his works also your thoughts in the AMV hell series.

214
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,036
Scott: Well, this isn't a question.

215
00:12:55,497 --> 00:13:01,535
Scott: So if this were jeopardy you would have just failed because there are no question marks now For anyone doesn't know who mr.

216
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:09,714
Rym: Vasquez is this is the creative genius behind invader-zim Johnny the homicidal maniac At all at alia.

217
00:13:09,894 --> 00:13:10,697
Rym: Yep.

218
00:13:10,877 --> 00:13:18,249
Scott: I enjoy invader-zim as much as I enjoy other cartoons Sort of like Rocco's modern life and rest in peace, which is pretty good.

219
00:13:18,712 --> 00:13:21,928
Rym: I was very much a fan of the especially the early episodes of invader-zim.

220
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:26,486
Scott: Yep I didn't really see more than the early episodes and Johnny the homicidal maniac.

221
00:13:26,908 --> 00:13:32,365
Scott: what little of it Was moderately enjoyable But parts of it were also not enjoyable.

222
00:13:32,405 --> 00:13:32,990
Scott: It really depended.

223
00:13:33,392 --> 00:13:36,226
Rym: Yeah, I enjoy it partly because I've never met any.

224
00:13:36,286 --> 00:13:37,070
Rym: with rare exception.

225
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,688
Rym: I've never met anyone who was a fan of Johnny and who wasn't and somehow cool.

226
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:47,713
Rym: Yep I mean like you walked on you just just you yell squee at an anime con and almost anyone who yells squee back is A cool guy.

227
00:13:47,733 --> 00:13:49,243
Scott: Yep or a girl.

228
00:13:49,626 --> 00:13:58,057
Scott: Yeah Yeah, so you don't know Vasquez not the most amazing most perfect favorite awesome guy in the world But he's not bad.

229
00:13:58,118 --> 00:13:58,983
Scott: He's a good dude.

230
00:13:59,224 --> 00:13:59,787
Scott: That's good stuff.

231
00:14:01,051 --> 00:14:01,995
Scott: AMV hell series.

232
00:14:02,316 --> 00:14:05,370
Scott: I had heard of the AMV hell series and never actually watched it.

233
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:11,730
Scott: I watched AMV held your number one on YouTube and it wasn't so exciting.

234
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:13,810
Scott: It was like a bunch of really short.

235
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:18,910
Scott: It's like someone came up with a bunch of AMV ideas, but couldn't actually be bothered to make real AMVs.

236
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:32,667
Scott: so they kind of made like these 10-second AMVs that just embodied the idea they came up with strung them all together and While they were comedic they weren't comedic enough to actually get me to go even ha once.

237
00:14:33,109 --> 00:14:36,550
Scott: so Lame I call this fan crap.

238
00:14:37,072 --> 00:14:39,761
Rym: I I guess things like this are a lot more fun to us.

239
00:14:40,384 --> 00:14:43,216
Rym: before we became jaded old men We've been to a million anime.

240
00:14:43,236 --> 00:14:46,569
Scott: Yeah, you had showed me this five years ago I would have pissed my pants.

241
00:14:46,891 --> 00:14:53,029
Scott: But because I've seen so much anime and so many music videos and been to so many cons This looks like fan crap to me.

242
00:14:53,331 --> 00:15:00,841
Rym: So yeah, my advice to you is if you're not jaded or you don't know what this is At least go check it out once at a con because it is good.

243
00:15:01,042 --> 00:15:02,850
Rym: It is well executed is well done.

244
00:15:02,931 --> 00:15:04,261
Rym: It is just not our bag anymore.

245
00:15:04,382 --> 00:15:09,662
Scott: Nope doesn't doesn't Get us stirred up, but it gets the normal anime fan stirred up.

246
00:15:10,466 --> 00:15:10,666
Rym: All right.

247
00:15:10,686 --> 00:15:13,636
Rym: now there's a question I'm gonna mention but skip now.

248
00:15:13,716 --> 00:15:34,449
Rym: hasbro asked us in the forums about how we feel about the fact that anime cons have kind of become generic geek cons and just the whole all this stuff about anime culture and Everything and all I'd really like to say is that we answered this question in excruciating detail on Anime world order and very shortly they're going to be playing an episode where they respond to that and they'll play it.

249
00:15:34,971 --> 00:15:54,085
Scott: Yeah, who knows if it'll be next week or the week after but if you just listen to their show We they said some things about it two shows ago and on their most recent show and then we just responded with a flurry As we already said flurry of voice MP3s and emails and I'm sure it will come up on there, you know coming up shows

250
00:15:54,366 --> 00:15:56,434
Rym: we will definitely keep you appraised Okay.

251
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:59,310
Rym: Now since I skipped one, I'm gonna actually pick a real question.

252
00:15:59,671 --> 00:16:00,836
Rym: Okay, I'm going right down the line.

253
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:07,689
Rym: We had a question from classic bra in the forums something you wanted to ask us How important is your relationship to each other to the overall show?

254
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:11,384
Rym: Do you think that the show was more about you guys or the things you talk about?

255
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:14,858
Scott: I Think the show isn't about us.

256
00:16:15,421 --> 00:16:29,179
Scott: Well, sometimes it's about us with the geek fables type things and Sometimes it is about the things we talk about because well, you know, because we're doing lame stuff but what the show I think is really about is our Perspective on the things we talk about.

257
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:31,350
Scott: it's us plus the things equals the show.

258
00:16:31,511 --> 00:16:35,130
Rym: I mean, I guess honestly, I really think we could have done geek.

259
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:43,258
Rym: No We could have done a podcast about Just about any topic in the world and it would have been generally the same quality unless it was a topic We didn't know anything about.

260
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,450
Scott: it would be the same flavor.

261
00:16:44,957 --> 00:16:45,869
Rym: Yeah, you get the same.

262
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:54,429
Rym: You know us yelling at each other in the same jokes and most people who listen they get the informative stuff and they like our Opinions, but most people seem to listen because they think we're funny.

263
00:16:55,213 --> 00:17:04,950
Scott: Yeah, we we don't intentionally try to make jokes And actually I was in the laundromat and Letterman was on last night and it was really painful to watch that.

264
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:14,635
Scott: I mean, there's a laugh track and an applause track and it's so Scripted and written and he's trying to be funny and it's not funny at all At least not to me.

265
00:17:14,655 --> 00:17:17,490
Rym: and meanwhile the two of us when we would hang out.

266
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:24,569
Rym: I mean the reason we do GeekNights The reason we wanted to do this was that back at RIT Like we had our group of friends the front row crew and we were cool.

267
00:17:24,691 --> 00:17:41,449
Rym: But as we started meeting new people and they'd come over and visit Scott and I'd be yelling at each other or like me Scott Alex and Pete and Katsu would be yelling at each other just doing What we do normally and these people who didn't know us or who had just met us would just sit there laughing hysterically And just basically providing a laugh track to us.

268
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:45,909
Scott: Yeah, it really only worked if they were geeky people though non geeky people didn't get it.

269
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:49,630
Scott: They would just be like what the hell you talking about, but geeky people would just laugh.

270
00:17:50,191 --> 00:17:58,274
Scott: Yeah, apparently our natural way of talking and way of living is hilarious to other geeks therefore GeekNights.

271
00:17:58,636 --> 00:18:01,289
Rym: Yep, and in terms of how important is our relationship to each other?

272
00:18:01,951 --> 00:18:05,370
Rym: It's we can talk about this from a bunch of the questions, but we're very good friends.

273
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:12,542
Rym: I mean the front row crew as a whole all of us myself Scott Alex Katsu Pete, I don't want to list everyone but you're all out there.

274
00:18:13,004 --> 00:18:15,150
Rym: We really all consider each other blood family.

275
00:18:15,532 --> 00:18:16,878
Rym: Yeah, we are very close.

276
00:18:16,939 --> 00:18:19,190
Scott: Well, not blood family the the non blood.

277
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:24,801
Rym: Well, we considered each other family But I say that many of us consider it as thick and as important as blood.

278
00:18:24,861 --> 00:18:26,626
Scott: the world is a filial.

279
00:18:26,646 --> 00:18:26,706
Scott: Yes.

280
00:18:27,228 --> 00:18:31,749
Rym: Yes And as I mean if we weren't friends, we couldn't do this.

281
00:18:31,971 --> 00:18:35,185
Rym: But at the same time Scott and I argue a lot.

282
00:18:36,692 --> 00:18:40,670
Rym: You have never heard us argue fully on the show because we don't want to subject you to that.

283
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:45,270
Rym: Yes, the patent thing was it kept going for almost an hour after I cut it off.

284
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,881
Rym: Yeah, you have no idea and it got to degenerate it to.

285
00:18:47,921 --> 00:18:48,403
Rym: you're stupid.

286
00:18:48,424 --> 00:18:49,046
Rym: No, you're stupid.

287
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:49,930
Rym: You're a horrible person.

288
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:50,995
Rym: I've lost all respect for you.

289
00:18:51,055 --> 00:18:52,320
Scott: Everything comes down to that.

290
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,184
Rym: You can go to hell.

291
00:18:53,385 --> 00:18:53,646
Rym: Yeah.

292
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:54,590
Rym: Well, I should just move out.

293
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,736
Rym: Yeah, fuck the podcast.

294
00:18:55,756 --> 00:18:58,550
Scott: Yeah, I don't think we never said let's move out.

295
00:18:59,212 --> 00:19:05,220
Rym: But we've said like I should just move away the socks or I hate you and We don't care.

296
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:05,401
Rym: like.

297
00:19:05,421 --> 00:19:06,608
Rym: we've all had arguments like that.

298
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,035
Scott: But it's like on South Park.

299
00:19:08,075 --> 00:19:09,842
Scott: the kids always make fun of each other, but they're.

300
00:19:09,943 --> 00:19:11,530
Scott: you know Cartman still hangs out with them.

301
00:19:11,912 --> 00:19:24,170
Rym: Yep, but no matter how angry we are at it well the angry isn't the word no matter how heated the argument we have is we can hit record in the middle of that and It disappears and we just do a show and you wouldn't even know that we were arguing a second earlier.

302
00:19:24,491 --> 00:19:28,443
Rym: Yep, like literally we've had shows was like Scott you're a pig fucker and I hate you.

303
00:19:28,563 --> 00:19:30,770
Rym: click it's time for things of the day.

304
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,196
Scott: All right Okay.

305
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:33,229
Rym: All right, you want to pick one?

306
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:34,372
Scott: Let's just.

307
00:19:34,432 --> 00:19:37,282
Scott: I'm gonna do the next three because two of them are kind of quick.

308
00:19:37,624 --> 00:19:39,390
Rym: All right, you knew kremlians.

309
00:19:39,751 --> 00:19:43,142
Scott: Yeah, okay kremlian your thoughts on freezing time and the moral nature of it.

310
00:19:43,222 --> 00:19:52,532
Scott: Yes, you know the inside joke We had where I once to use freezing time as an example in an argument where I was trying to demonstrate no harm No foul.

311
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:54,037
Scott: Yes, that's enough of that.

312
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,586
Scott: All I can say to that is no harm.

313
00:19:56,606 --> 00:19:59,015
Scott: No foul the end Thane of Cod.

314
00:19:59,075 --> 00:19:59,858
Scott: or here's a question.

315
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,544
Scott: Where's the freakin burning wheel episode?

316
00:20:01,584 --> 00:20:03,070
Scott: I know you're not a pair of shit talkers.

317
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:07,720
Scott: Thank you for you know Continuing our definition of the word shit talkers.

318
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:07,940
Rym: Yep.

319
00:20:08,021 --> 00:20:10,210
Rym: In fact, we're very glad that you don't think we're shit talkers.

320
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:14,230
Scott: Yes, and when our vocabulary is spread among the masses that pleases us greatly.

321
00:20:15,134 --> 00:20:16,169
Scott: So when is it going to happen?

322
00:20:16,831 --> 00:20:26,270
Scott: Well, it's gonna happen two times number one when we get Luke Crane on the horn and two when we actually play a lot More burning wheel because we honestly we like it a lot and we have the books.

323
00:20:26,671 --> 00:20:29,963
Scott: We haven't played it a lot as much not as nearly as much as we want to.

324
00:20:30,044 --> 00:20:37,530
Scott: so we need more burning wheel Experience and we need to talk with the man himself and you will get more burning wheel episode and you want to do it.

325
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:44,270
Rym: Yes, once we get Luke Crane on the show, which he kind of said he was interested in the last time we talked to him I think that'll be one hell of an episode.

326
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,474
Scott: That would be one hell of an episode.

327
00:20:45,615 --> 00:20:50,090
Scott: and the third question what two subject subjects should I pick for next year film in history?

328
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:56,227
Scott: the Holocaust American Century the Hollywood industry Australian politics the politics of third world states?

329
00:20:56,308 --> 00:20:58,675
Scott: well My picks.

330
00:20:58,996 --> 00:21:08,920
Scott: if I was having to choose between those any two I would do the Hollywood industry because I would be able to argue with people in the class every day about the evil MPAA.

331
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:13,148
Scott: and Maybe I would also pick.

332
00:21:14,511 --> 00:21:17,103
Scott: I might pick the Holocaust in case of the Holocaust denier.

333
00:21:17,163 --> 00:21:18,550
Scott: That would make the class a lot of fun.

334
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:21,307
Rym: Yeah, I wouldn't make the Holocaust just because I know so much about it.

335
00:21:21,388 --> 00:21:21,770
Scott: Yeah, I do.

336
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:30,834
Scott: I also do know a lot about the Holocaust and American Century also looks good because pretty much everything interesting happened between 1900 and 2000.

337
00:21:30,834 --> 00:21:34,411
Rym: Yeah, they definitely don't mean between 1700 and 1800.

338
00:21:34,411 --> 00:21:38,826
Scott: Yeah, so that will leave a great deal of great class discussions to have.

339
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:44,583
Rym: so in the very least Let's say this you probably don't want to take the politics of third world states.

340
00:21:45,145 --> 00:21:52,950
Rym: the politics of third world states are Horrible and tedious and you just you'll lose a lot of the respect you have for fellow man.

341
00:21:53,192 --> 00:22:04,643
Scott: Yep, and while film in history you know that could be good because actually the one film class I ever took is one of the greatest classes ever took at RIT and I would take that class again if I could film in history.

342
00:22:04,703 --> 00:22:06,310
Scott: I don't know how exciting that one sounds.

343
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,595
Scott: I took fine art film art.

344
00:22:08,016 --> 00:22:09,000
Scott: So whatever.

345
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,308
Rym: Yeah, it's really hard to say do what you like.

346
00:22:11,389 --> 00:22:13,780
Rym: personally I'd look for something completely different from all of these.

347
00:22:13,881 --> 00:22:15,770
Rym: I assume you have to pick something from this list.

348
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:17,325
Scott: Yeah, so there you go.

349
00:22:18,133 --> 00:22:18,702
Scott: Okay, your turn.

350
00:22:19,107 --> 00:22:23,490
Rym: All right I'm gonna skip a bit because I want to get the good questions now or at least one really good question.

351
00:22:23,611 --> 00:22:24,356
Rym: I think it's great.

352
00:22:24,879 --> 00:22:26,450
Rym: Colin asked us again in the forums.

353
00:22:27,171 --> 00:22:30,589
Rym: You've been graduated from college and been in the real world for a while now.

354
00:22:31,591 --> 00:22:37,250
Rym: What have you had to learn during this time that you wish someone would have told you when you were younger.

355
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:46,437
Rym: I think your younger listeners would greatly benefit from this topic and we actually talked about this a bit on geek speak Just a little while ago Part one.

356
00:22:46,457 --> 00:22:53,310
Rym: the main thing is that I have to say that These aren't things that I wish someone had told me because I already figured these things out.

357
00:22:53,691 --> 00:22:55,940
Rym: I went through college knowing that my grades didn't matter.

358
00:22:56,221 --> 00:22:58,650
Rym: I went through high school knowing that nothing I did mattered.

359
00:22:59,552 --> 00:23:02,990
Scott: Yeah, I didn't go through middle school knowing that the things didn't matter.

360
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:03,713
Rym: Yeah, me either.

361
00:23:03,913 --> 00:23:09,208
Scott: if I see if I went back to tell myself something by late high school I had it figured out.

362
00:23:09,711 --> 00:23:18,026
Scott: so it would have to be me telling my early high school self or my middle or elementary school self something and Mostly it would be grades don't matter.

363
00:23:19,951 --> 00:23:21,275
Scott: Here's how to get ladies.

364
00:23:21,656 --> 00:23:24,385
Rym: don't bother going to the prom just go to a party somewhere else.

365
00:23:24,566 --> 00:23:25,810
Scott: anime conventions exist.

366
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:27,497
Scott: I could have been going to them a lot earlier.

367
00:23:27,517 --> 00:23:27,578
Scott: Yep.

368
00:23:28,642 --> 00:23:30,390
Scott: Here's how to get anime.

369
00:23:31,571 --> 00:23:33,629
Scott: You know all that sort of stuff that I just you know.

370
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,836
Scott: Get me into geekery sooner.

371
00:23:36,136 --> 00:23:41,230
Scott: get myself to play settlers of Catan sooner to play German board games sooner to see anime sooner.

372
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,836
Scott: That's the kind of stuff that I would do.

373
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:46,510
Rym: but thus we'll just make this more of a. what advice would we give to younger?

374
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:55,454
Rym: People out there now and very quickly one your grades in middle school and high school to a great degree mean Absolutely, nothing.

375
00:23:55,776 --> 00:24:01,630
Scott: unless you want to go to Harvard or MIT or so or Cal CMU you do not need great grades.

376
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:10,730
Rym: you were much better off taking AP classes, which will save you money in college or Once you graduate high school going off and just trying to make it somewhere and don't even bother with college.

377
00:24:11,132 --> 00:24:13,950
Scott: Yeah, I am becoming more and more a fan, you know Penn Jillette.

378
00:24:14,091 --> 00:24:15,116
Scott: I think you know.

379
00:24:15,157 --> 00:24:22,570
Scott: at first I thought he was crazy when he said no college and I'm beginning to think that maybe I used to think everyone needed to go to college or you'd be a loser.

380
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,979
Scott: But now I'm beginning to think maybe you don't a lot more.

381
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:33,350
Scott: if you look at the list of successful people and they you know The history of the world or important people a lot of them just didn't go to college or even high school.

382
00:24:34,311 --> 00:24:37,129
Scott: So you really got to think about what you want to do with your life?

383
00:24:37,671 --> 00:24:43,310
Scott: And if college is something that's right for you and something you want to spend four or more years of your life doing.

384
00:24:43,612 --> 00:24:46,070
Rym: Yep, I mean there you can get a lot out of college.

385
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,436
Rym: We're not saying that you shouldn't go.

386
00:24:47,496 --> 00:24:57,350
Rym: I mean going to college has made our lives Wonderful mainly because the college we went to and the people we met have pretty much sealed our fate for the rest of our lives.

387
00:24:57,511 --> 00:24:59,261
Rym: I mean we have the front row crew.

388
00:24:59,281 --> 00:25:00,649
Rym: We're big in the anime culture.

389
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:13,189
Rym: we have all these things going for us because of the people we met and the things we did in college and College is an experience that Really can't be paralleled in terms of just the lifestyle and the living and the fun.

390
00:25:13,691 --> 00:25:19,410
Scott: But at the same time Bill Gates dropped out of college and I don't think I don't know if Steve Jobs or Wozniak even went to.

391
00:25:19,871 --> 00:25:20,654
Scott: I have to go check on.

392
00:25:20,694 --> 00:25:23,645
Rym: I guess don't go to college because you think you have to.

393
00:25:23,967 --> 00:25:27,559
Rym: don't go to college Because you want to get an education alone.

394
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,770
Rym: if you just want an education you can teach yourself.

395
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,399
Rym: You can find someone to teach you.

396
00:25:32,681 --> 00:25:34,250
Rym: you can go to a community college.

397
00:25:34,452 --> 00:25:36,169
Scott: You can get a job and learn on the job.

398
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,016
Rym: You go to college to meet people.

399
00:25:38,096 --> 00:25:39,621
Rym: you go to college for the networking.

400
00:25:39,902 --> 00:25:42,270
Rym: you go to college to be social in the real world.

401
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:48,770
Scott: You go to college because you want to do something that requires college like be a doctor or a dentist or something like that.

402
00:25:48,991 --> 00:25:53,550
Rym: If you don't know what you want to do unless you have money just coming out of your ass don't go to college.

403
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:58,036
Rym: Yep, until you know what you want to do if you decide you want to be a lawyer Go to college.

404
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,322
Scott: you need to go to college to be a lawyer.

405
00:25:59,422 --> 00:26:01,030
Rym: all right unless you're just crazy and you pass the bar.

406
00:26:01,211 --> 00:26:03,547
Scott: Yeah, you could just self-study and pass the bar all right.

407
00:26:04,691 --> 00:26:06,859
Scott: What are your favorite board games at each player number?

408
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,686
Scott: your favorite light medium and heavy games?

409
00:26:08,726 --> 00:26:09,670
Scott: all right player numbers?

410
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,417
Scott: What do you say to player to player it?

411
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:14,009
Rym: There's really no good to player game.

412
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,314
Scott: well I haven't found a game.

413
00:26:15,334 --> 00:26:16,800
Scott: That's excellent to player.

414
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,081
Scott: like.

415
00:26:17,221 --> 00:26:19,610
Scott: there are some good two-player games and some bad ones.

416
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:20,497
Scott: I haven't found a game.

417
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,230
Scott: That's like an amazing two-player game.

418
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:22,993
Scott: I love to play.

419
00:26:23,073 --> 00:26:25,944
Scott: I guess the only ones I can really pick would be lost.

420
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:32,162
Scott: cities is kind of good and San Juan played two players, okay, I enjoy a Stratego.

421
00:26:32,323 --> 00:26:33,466
Rym: I enjoy Attica two-player.

422
00:26:33,486 --> 00:26:34,590
Rym: I like Stratego two-player.

423
00:26:34,992 --> 00:26:36,179
Rym: I really liked st.

424
00:26:36,259 --> 00:26:38,110
Scott: Petersburg to player until we solved it.

425
00:26:38,311 --> 00:26:41,020
Rym: We solved the game and also we discovered the game is broken.

426
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:49,670
Rym: yep three players, Puerto Rico hands down, Puerto Rico Is one probably in my eyes the most perfect board game ever constructed yep?

427
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:54,188
Rym: I can't think of any game that has even come close to the Citizen Kane of board games.

428
00:26:54,409 --> 00:27:00,584
Rym: yes Not my favorite game anymore But especially the three-player version of Puerto Rico is just this perfect perfect game.

429
00:27:00,645 --> 00:27:06,770
Scott: most people seem to like the four and five But I think it's because we played the three players so much that we're we really like that more.

430
00:27:06,971 --> 00:27:09,940
Scott: Yeah, four player Tigris and Euphrates hands down.

431
00:27:10,482 --> 00:27:12,870
Rym: Tigris and Euphrates is just an amazing game.

432
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,538
Scott: Yep, four player five player.

433
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:19,630
Rym: I would say I'm on Ray, but that's just because I haven't played Calus enough.

434
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:23,790
Scott: I think yeah, but see the thing is I would say Calus more for the six player.

435
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:26,553
Rym: Yeah It's hard to see.

436
00:27:26,573 --> 00:27:30,449
Rym: it's hard to say at that point because games that have more than four tend to have many more than four.

437
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:37,968
Scott: Yeah, I'm on Ray is good five player, but there are also you know there are games that we haven't played that you know.

438
00:27:38,109 --> 00:27:40,376
Scott: might Trump over these things.

439
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:45,596
Rym: you know it's hard to say what our favorite game is just because we like so many games And we like them all for different reasons.

440
00:27:45,837 --> 00:27:48,229
Scott: yep light medium and heavy games.

441
00:27:49,512 --> 00:27:50,987
Scott: What's light that we like?

442
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:52,916
Scott: Carcassonne is kind of light.

443
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,509
Rym: yeah, I would say it's light only because I've solved it.

444
00:27:55,971 --> 00:27:59,290
Scott: Yeah, maybe that maybe Carcassonne is medium light could be Stratego.

445
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,276
Rym: It's I mean it's hard.

446
00:28:01,316 --> 00:28:07,034
Rym: basically the way I categorize games are trivial normal and difficult As opposed to light.

447
00:28:07,074 --> 00:28:09,743
Rym: medium heavy yeah difficult is like Tigers and Euphrates.

448
00:28:10,004 --> 00:28:11,328
Rym: so Carcassonne isn't trivial.

449
00:28:11,348 --> 00:28:11,810
Scott: It's medium.

450
00:28:12,171 --> 00:28:13,776
Rym: Yeah, we don't really play trivial games.

451
00:28:14,217 --> 00:28:18,610
Scott: No we played Timbuktu once yeah, but that's not it's not.

452
00:28:19,271 --> 00:28:21,418
Scott: Yeah, that's debatable whether it's trivial.

453
00:28:21,438 --> 00:28:23,284
Scott: I would say it's not trivial to everyone.

454
00:28:23,485 --> 00:28:24,107
Rym: It's trivial.

455
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:32,489
Rym: it's something like Candyland is trivial to everyone yeah, but I would consider to a German board game or a game like Timbuktu is trivial if you're reasonably intelligent.

456
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:37,262
Rym: Deductive yeah, yeah, yeah Okay, and you understand game theory.

457
00:28:37,342 --> 00:28:38,329
Scott: Yeah, heavy games.

458
00:28:38,931 --> 00:28:43,183
Scott: I guess if you consider Tigris and Euphrates and Kayla's heavy then there you have it.

459
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:44,908
Scott: We like the German games.

460
00:28:45,469 --> 00:28:48,309
Rym: Yes Alright, I'm gonna jump around today.

461
00:28:49,012 --> 00:28:50,817
Scott: You guys planning any to chibi?

462
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:53,343
Scott: usa says you guys planning any trips to Florida.

463
00:28:53,363 --> 00:28:54,306
Rym: Are you gonna do two now?

464
00:28:54,547 --> 00:29:04,314
Scott: Yeah alright, so Yeah My grandma lives in Florida and haven't visited in a while, so I might visit her soon Maybe in the winter.

465
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:07,725
Rym: who knows all right you did too, so I'm gonna do two all right.

466
00:29:07,825 --> 00:29:12,459
Rym: I'll start off with a Rayleth in the forums asked us quote.

467
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,788
Rym: What are you guys going to do when the zombies attack?

468
00:29:14,888 --> 00:29:15,390
Rym: and it's funny.

469
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:21,990
Scott: You should ask that because we have you know how some people in their buildings or houses have a plan of fire escape.

470
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:26,002
Scott: We have a plan of zombie attack for every situation that we are ever in.

471
00:29:26,243 --> 00:29:33,448
Rym: whenever we're bored at a convention or at Wildwood, New Jersey wherever we happen to be we just debate what we would do and it did like.

472
00:29:33,729 --> 00:29:40,041
Rym: well If they're fast zombies that only infect with a bite we do this But if they're slow zombies that lunge we do this.

473
00:29:40,322 --> 00:29:44,679
Scott: and if the zombies are they aimless zombies Or they come after you eat the brain zombies.

474
00:29:44,779 --> 00:29:47,870
Rym: Yeah, are they 28 days later zombies or dawn of the dead zombies?

475
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:49,959
Scott: Yeah, it depends on a lot of things.

476
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,346
Scott: zombies eat my neighbor zombies.

477
00:29:51,487 --> 00:29:58,630
Scott: yep, and For every situation we've got a plan that usually involves motor vehicles.

478
00:29:59,192 --> 00:30:00,679
Scott: Different forms of transportation.

479
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:13,248
Rym: trains are very good for zombie attacks guns explosives chainsaws knives Chopping malls, it's not Dan everyone says the baseball bat a good bokto will serve just as well.

480
00:30:13,569 --> 00:30:15,501
Rym: indeed In fact better because you can poke it through the eye.

481
00:30:15,803 --> 00:30:18,229
Rym: yep, but anyway We're not gonna give you all the plans.

482
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,364
Rym: But suffice to say if when the zombies come we're ready.

483
00:30:21,465 --> 00:30:27,470
Rym: if you come out to the geek house We can probably protect you, but we probably won't be able to feed you unless you can fend for yourself.

484
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:28,579
Rym: We'll just eat you.

485
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:32,006
Scott: oh Yeah, come to the geek house in the zombie attack.

486
00:30:32,046 --> 00:30:35,489
Rym: Yeah Send more paramedics.

487
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:39,637
Scott: Great I'm a vegetarian zombie.

488
00:30:39,697 --> 00:30:41,424
Scott: It's an old joke great.

489
00:30:41,444 --> 00:30:53,288
Rym: I'm gonna do another one here Fantasos in the forums as this question and I bring this up only because this is an issue that we know quite a bit about And I'm surprised someone even noticed that we talked about this.

490
00:30:54,512 --> 00:30:58,069
Rym: This question has occurred to me every morning when I'm getting ready, but I keep forgetting to ask it.

491
00:30:59,554 --> 00:31:04,490
Rym: While ago, I don't know one of you made a passing remark about how deodorant was good, but antiperspirant was bad.

492
00:31:04,893 --> 00:31:07,450
Rym: It was completely tangential, and it wasn't coming on further.

493
00:31:08,653 --> 00:31:09,749
Rym: What's wrong with antiperspirant?

494
00:31:10,891 --> 00:31:13,061
Rym: Is the only people I've ever heard talk about this?

495
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,930
Rym: or crazy hippies or some sort of Randy ness?

496
00:31:15,772 --> 00:31:16,759
Rym: All right point the first.

497
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,128
Scott: I like how he said Randy ness.

498
00:31:18,268 --> 00:31:22,930
Scott: yes We're spreading the vocabulary of GeekNights even farther, and that was a great paraphrasing Rym.

499
00:31:23,311 --> 00:31:24,255
Rym: Yeah, I'm proud of that.

500
00:31:24,537 --> 00:31:25,581
Rym: I think I do a good job at that.

501
00:31:25,601 --> 00:31:27,750
Rym: You know what I'm Maggie with paraphrasing skills.

502
00:31:28,252 --> 00:31:35,433
Scott: Oh god someone else's vocabulary spreads to you, and then comes back to uh Okay, okay.

503
00:31:35,915 --> 00:31:37,160
Rym: now point the first.

504
00:31:37,622 --> 00:31:39,630
Rym: your body wants to sweat.

505
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:42,400
Rym: There is probably a reason it is trying to sweat.

506
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,343
Scott: sweating is good.

507
00:31:43,504 --> 00:31:45,210
Scott: It's like your natural coolant system.

508
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:49,130
Scott: You know what happens if you take the coolant system out of a computer or your car it catches fire.

509
00:31:50,153 --> 00:31:51,016
Scott: You want to sweat.

510
00:31:51,096 --> 00:31:53,002
Scott: that is your number one coolant system.

511
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:55,310
Scott: you need to use it if you prevent sweating.

512
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:58,081
Scott: It's like taking the heat sink off your CPU.

513
00:31:58,241 --> 00:31:59,727
Scott: very bad very very bad.

514
00:31:59,807 --> 00:32:12,214
Scott: now number two And this is more a cosmetic thing the vast majority of antiperspirants in the United States pretty much all the ones that work all the Ones that don't use this method are the bullshit hippie sea salt Crystal crap.

515
00:32:12,234 --> 00:32:13,477
Scott: that is just hippie crap.

516
00:32:13,497 --> 00:32:14,641
Scott: that doesn't work now.

517
00:32:14,661 --> 00:32:20,460
Rym: They contain one of three chemical compounds Aluminum chloride or aluminium.

518
00:32:20,661 --> 00:32:31,950
Rym: for those aluminium aluminium aluminium Chlorhydrate or aluminium zirconia notice the common ingredient in and all those now Aluminum is a wonderful metal.

519
00:32:32,251 --> 00:32:34,437
Rym: There is evidence both ways there.

520
00:32:34,457 --> 00:32:43,670
Rym: there have been some tiny links between aluminum exposure in quantity and Alzheimer's disease But I'll say right now those are not in any way statistically verifiable.

521
00:32:44,272 --> 00:32:50,610
Scott: The reason that antiperspirant is bad and the reason that aluminum is an ingredient is the way antiperspirant works.

522
00:32:50,991 --> 00:32:55,404
Scott: There are aluminum shards in the antiperspirant that clog your pores.

523
00:32:55,826 --> 00:33:02,106
Scott: now if you don't mind Aluminum shards clogging your pores be my guest and use antiperspirant personally.

524
00:33:02,126 --> 00:33:08,230
Scott: I don't like to You know destroy all the pores in my armpits with shards of aluminum.

525
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,253
Rym: Yeah, I mean quite literally.

526
00:33:09,293 --> 00:33:22,470
Rym: this aluminum reacts with your sweat and things in your sweat to form a jealous kind of plug in the Sweat gland that swells up and it it actually can damage the sweat glands indeed And that's what it's trying to do because it doesn't want you to perspire.

527
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:36,068
Rym: Using antiperspirants too much can cause you in the end to sweat more or to get to the point where if you don't wear any Perspirant you'll sweat up more than you humanly should and it's bad or you can destroy everything so you won't sweat.

528
00:33:36,148 --> 00:33:36,810
Scott: that's dangerous.

529
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,790
Rym: Now two About three I guess all these aluminum compounds will stain clothing.

530
00:33:43,111 --> 00:33:47,930
Rym: So if you have ever ruined a shirt because you got these yellow stains in the pits that is because of your antiperspirant.

531
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:51,546
Rym: No human excretion unless you have a disease will cause that.

532
00:33:51,566 --> 00:33:57,406
Rym: well pee Well human excretion from the sweat gland there you go unless you have a disease or unless you didn't shower.

533
00:33:57,727 --> 00:34:01,227
Rym: if you've ever gotten sweat Stains that is caused by any perspirants.

534
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:06,770
Rym: yep And if you have a problem with odor down there one trim the hair a little bit.

535
00:34:07,091 --> 00:34:11,728
Rym: Having less hair in the armpits means less surface area which means less order to shower down there.

536
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:14,103
Scott: three Deodorant that isn't any perspirant.

537
00:34:14,224 --> 00:34:16,717
Rym: Yes, however Hippies with their crystals.

538
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:18,382
Rym: No that doesn't work.

539
00:34:18,524 --> 00:34:26,670
Scott: No go to the store and There there aren't many of them, but there are brands of deodorant that are not antiperspirant.

540
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,976
Rym: They're actually kind of sparse now in the u.s..

541
00:34:28,998 --> 00:34:32,509
Scott: Because bars yeah the ones with baking soda are good.

542
00:34:33,312 --> 00:34:38,190
Scott: So we're the one I even know baking soda doesn't really get rid of I know, but they're still good.

543
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,696
Scott: Well, they feel they do the function.

544
00:34:39,797 --> 00:34:42,909
Scott: Yeah, they feel the rising even though baking soda doesn't deodorize.

545
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,663
Rym: I've actually had a problem where I if I find a deodorant.

546
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:50,420
Rym: I like I will use it forever Yeah, and and then they'll cancel it four times in my life.

547
00:34:50,502 --> 00:34:51,324
Rym: I found a deodorant.

548
00:34:51,364 --> 00:34:51,666
Rym: I like.

549
00:34:51,826 --> 00:34:52,248
Rym: I use it.

550
00:34:52,308 --> 00:34:53,252
Rym: It smells nice It works.

551
00:34:53,533 --> 00:34:54,217
Scott: I'm on my third.

552
00:34:54,277 --> 00:34:55,382
Scott: I'm on my fourth variety.

553
00:34:55,422 --> 00:34:58,970
Scott: if you count the one antiperspirant I used at the beginning they keep getting canceled.

554
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:02,390
Rym: Yeah, I used to use antiperspirant when I was young and you know what I sweated more.

555
00:35:02,611 --> 00:35:05,029
Rym: So I put more antiperspirant on and then I sweated more.

556
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:09,385
Scott: yep I started using ban which was just a roll on whatever.

557
00:35:09,505 --> 00:35:21,530
Scott: then I switched to Mitchum and then when I learned about the aluminum shards I switched to a Standard deodorant speed stick that was green and now I'm using this bluish green degree, which is actually pretty good.

558
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:22,957
Scott: I like it all right.

559
00:35:22,977 --> 00:35:25,128
Rym: I want to do one more question because this one will be real short.

560
00:35:26,052 --> 00:35:30,730
Rym: Amethyst home away asked us in the forums what separates you from other podcasts?

561
00:35:32,993 --> 00:35:34,229
Rym: We're good we do a lot.

562
00:35:36,196 --> 00:35:43,950
Rym: We do a lot more Podcasting than other podcasts not to sound I guess conceited, but I think we run a much more professional shop.

563
00:35:46,251 --> 00:35:53,122
Scott: Other podcasts seem to really be into the whole Podcasting thing and we're just kind of doing our own thing not caring about.

564
00:35:53,603 --> 00:35:58,762
Scott: you know the you know the quote official Podcast community and all that stuff that's going on in there.

565
00:35:58,842 --> 00:36:00,530
Scott: I just stopped paying attention to all that crap.

566
00:36:00,831 --> 00:36:04,206
Rym: Yep, I mean half of what we say is what we would have said to each other anyway if the mics weren't here.

567
00:36:04,487 --> 00:36:06,852
Scott: yep I can't.

568
00:36:06,892 --> 00:36:17,250
Rym: really it's a hard question to answer any more than that yeah, especially since I really I'm real I like self promoting like when I'm talking myself up to be on a panel or I'm interviewing for a job.

569
00:36:17,832 --> 00:36:21,123
Rym: I really feel icky self promoting for any other purpose.

570
00:36:21,323 --> 00:36:22,126
Rym: Yep, okay.

571
00:36:22,166 --> 00:36:23,370
Scott: Let's see what question we got here.

572
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:28,339
Scott: Oh The where's the one about a billion dollars?

573
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,846
Rym: It's right under that one is it?

574
00:36:30,006 --> 00:36:31,958
Rym: yeah, bald matrix Let me fight.

575
00:36:31,978 --> 00:36:33,126
Scott: I think I lost it all right.

576
00:36:33,368 --> 00:36:36,725
Scott: I'll read Oh, what would you guys do if you had a billion dollars?

577
00:36:36,845 --> 00:36:37,830
Rym: Scott can answer this first?

578
00:36:38,371 --> 00:36:40,710
Scott: I know exactly what I would do if I had a billion dollars.

579
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:44,660
Scott: I would buy exactly one thing that costs a billion dollars.

580
00:36:44,881 --> 00:36:48,410
Scott: that one thing is the cable vision corporation in New York City.

581
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:53,145
Scott: If you buy the cable vision corporation here is what you get.

582
00:36:53,205 --> 00:36:54,689
Scott: are you ready for this list of things you get?

583
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:59,582
Scott: Number one you get optimum online optimum voice optimum TV.

Scott: It's two sports teams baby and the best hockey my favorite hockey team not the best They don't.

591
00:37:19,992 --> 00:37:21,701
Scott: they did okay this season not that great.

592
00:37:22,103 --> 00:37:23,509
Scott: They got to the playoffs and then they went poop.

593
00:37:24,632 --> 00:37:25,495
Scott: But that's not the point.

594
00:37:25,797 --> 00:37:31,437
Scott: the point is the cable vision corporation is Worth about a billion dollars.

595
00:37:31,477 --> 00:37:35,790
Scott: the last time I checked I remember there was some newspaper thing about it years ago.

596
00:37:36,032 --> 00:37:38,273
Scott: It could be worth more than a billion dollars now but I don't care.

597
00:37:38,293 --> 00:37:38,875
Scott: it's not the point.

598
00:37:39,498 --> 00:37:58,797
Scott: if I own cable vision not only would the Profits coming in from such an ownership be able to buy anything else I would need but Just about anything that I could think to buy I could get and I would also own an arena where I could have awesome conventions in New York City property.

599
00:37:58,837 --> 00:38:05,979
Scott: they own a lot of property in New York City that I could live in and sports teams and TV and Internet and I would make the.

600
00:38:06,381 --> 00:38:20,106
Scott: I would be able to use Cable vision in the ISP of optimum line to push my ISP agenda and do things like Fight for net neutrality and all that other good stuff and geeks I could hook them up with.

601
00:38:20,147 --> 00:38:30,101
Scott: my awesome optimum line is penis and I could do a great service for geekery as well as living a life of luxury and then You know retire with a life of philanthropy.

602
00:38:30,543 --> 00:38:30,684
Rym: Yep.

603
00:38:30,805 --> 00:38:34,969
Rym: I think Scott's answer is real good So I won't bother answering because it's somewhat similar in what I would do.

604
00:38:35,371 --> 00:38:39,850
Rym: I can say that everyone I'm good friends with would be very well off for the rest of their lives.

605
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:43,348
Scott: Well, duh, if I was the owner cable vision, they would be all well off.

606
00:38:43,408 --> 00:38:43,830
Scott: It would be great.

607
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:44,914
Scott: No one would need to work anymore.

608
00:38:44,934 --> 00:38:45,456
Rym: All right.

609
00:38:45,537 --> 00:38:48,689
Rym: Now here's a question that was emailed to us by Joe from New York.

610
00:38:50,071 --> 00:38:51,621
Rym: Why did the two of you live together?

611
00:38:51,641 --> 00:38:53,190
Rym: rent issues close pals?

612
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:57,222
Rym: I've been wondering about this for a while now, but I never got around to actually emailing you.

613
00:38:57,924 --> 00:38:59,609
Rym: Well, there's a funny story about that.

614
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:09,990
Rym: Now when we were at RIT where the front row crew which was myself and Scott Alex our friend Pete our friend katsu and then a bunch of other people that were around but all of us were the ones who?

615
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:15,445
Rym: Were trying to kind of go into housing together Because at RIT they have this housing lottery and we wanted to get.

616
00:39:15,465 --> 00:39:35,631
Rym: it was myself Greg Alex and Scott who decided the four of us are going to get an apartment together and We got in the lottery and we were standing in line and there was a one Two-bedroom four person apartment left in all of RIT and We were up next and as we're walking in the lady walked out and she crossed it off because the people before us had taken It

617
00:39:36,253 --> 00:39:40,530
Scott: and we figured that we were gonna have to suck it up and go to live in River Hole which River Knoll

618
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:41,375
Rym: It's a hellhole.

619
00:39:41,556 --> 00:39:43,104
Scott: It sucks, but we were like fine.

620
00:39:43,185 --> 00:39:45,127
Scott: It was better than the dorm So we were gonna take it.

621
00:39:45,491 --> 00:39:52,970
Rym: So the four of us are walking over and then someone from across the room yells No one wants these two one-bedroom apartments in colony.

622
00:39:54,252 --> 00:39:54,996
Scott: No, I think it was.

623
00:39:55,076 --> 00:39:58,110
Scott: we said we'll take the River Knoll and they're like, wow, no one wants these in colony.

624
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:58,612
Scott: We're like we do.

625
00:39:59,114 --> 00:40:02,790
Rym: Yep, and what they were is actually it turned out they're all of all the apartments in RIT.

626
00:40:03,292 --> 00:40:17,383
Rym: There are only six of these and they are the best possible apartment you can get because in terms of square footage per person and price because they're one or two occupancy and There are pretty much as large as the three and four person apartments.

627
00:40:17,785 --> 00:40:19,010
Scott: They're just missing one bedroom.

628
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:21,258
Scott: They only have one bedroom instead of two.

629
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,470
Rym: so the four of us are standing there and we're like, let's do this.

630
00:40:24,591 --> 00:40:27,130
Rym: We can just live right next to each other and it'll be awesome.

631
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:27,933
Rym: It'll have more space.

632
00:40:28,474 --> 00:40:29,879
Rym: and then everyone looks everyone.

633
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:35,290
Rym: and then Greg at the time asked the important question Who's going to live with Scott?

634
00:40:37,172 --> 00:40:40,385
Rym: Everyone stood there for a minute and no one said anything.

635
00:40:40,786 --> 00:40:53,661
Rym: and finally I said Alright, I think I can deal with him because I'm real I'm real thick-headed thins thick-skulled when it comes to that sort of thing and History was decided in a minute.

636
00:40:54,003 --> 00:40:54,947
Scott: It's like a few seconds.

637
00:40:55,169 --> 00:40:59,068
Scott: Yeah If it had turned any other way, who knows what things would be like now?

638
00:40:59,088 --> 00:41:06,550
Rym: now Despite the fact that Scott and I live together all through college Effectively all of our friends lived with us because they were just in our apartment all the time.

639
00:41:06,891 --> 00:41:11,370
Rym: Most of the time our apartment was like the center of our of everyone's social lives.

640
00:41:11,691 --> 00:41:17,233
Rym: It was indeed which was funny because it was very small Small for that.

641
00:41:17,273 --> 00:41:20,184
Rym: many people like we'd have 15 like like 10 people over.

642
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:21,970
Rym: that was too much and it was just a bunch.

643
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:26,351
Rym: Everyone would sit and not move because he couldn't do anything and we'd all just kind of yell and talk and it was a good Time.

644
00:41:26,391 --> 00:41:28,261
Rym: we have a lot of stories from that apartment we do.

645
00:41:28,703 --> 00:41:28,904
Rym: so.

646
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:37,236
Rym: I moved away Oh for a while for six months to work for IBM in Poughkeepsie and I got a condo there and Scott just lived in the apartment by himself.

647
00:41:37,296 --> 00:41:38,079
Rym: I kept paying rent.

648
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:39,926
Rym: So technically I still had the apartment.

649
00:41:39,947 --> 00:41:40,710
Rym: I left all my stuff there.

650
00:41:41,651 --> 00:41:43,064
Rym: Then we all moved away for the summer.

651
00:41:43,124 --> 00:41:43,770
Rym: We all moved back.

652
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:46,509
Rym: I went back to RIT at the end of that year of RIT.

653
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:49,240

654
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:50,303
Scott: Is he graduated?

655
00:41:50,584 --> 00:41:51,307
Rym: Well, no, I didn't.

656
00:41:51,668 --> 00:41:52,110
Scott: Oh, that's right.

657
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:52,210
Scott: I

658
00:41:52,251 --> 00:42:15,110
Rym: just left RIT and I stepped down from all my positions like the anime club and I moved away to work for IBM and I eventually I lived in a whole bunch of places in the mid Hudson Valley and then Scott graduated and I eventually did graduate remotely and he went to live with his parents for a while and got a job and I was working at IBM and Eventually, I found I decided, you know, we need to get out place somewhere and I hey Scott, let's move in together.

665
00:42:42,112 --> 00:42:44,041
Rym: Also the fact that the whole front row crew is.

Rym: Yeah, also as you can tell from the show we do get along.

673
00:43:15,198 --> 00:43:15,359
Scott: Yep.

674
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,686

00:43:19,511 --> 00:43:20,012
Scott: Yeah, okay.

677
00:43:20,093 --> 00:43:22,460
Scott: Let's I'm gonna read a bunch of really quick ones ready.

678
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,550
Scott: All right your opinions on emos and their emo ness.

679
00:43:25,831 --> 00:43:28,524
Rym: All right, the word emo is stupid.

680
00:43:28,745 --> 00:43:29,569
Scott: from chemical base.

681
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:34,663
Rym: Emo is a term that appeared somewhat recently, but it's not a new concept.

682
00:43:34,884 --> 00:43:36,930
Rym: teenagers have been this way since the dawn of time.

683
00:43:37,272 --> 00:43:38,498
Rym: Nothing has changed there.

684
00:43:38,518 --> 00:43:40,930
Rym: Why is there a new word for something that has always been around?

685
00:43:41,671 --> 00:43:43,316
Scott: It's just some trendy bullshit.

686
00:43:43,356 --> 00:43:43,878
Scott: You know what?

687
00:43:44,139 --> 00:43:47,770
Scott: I just ignore and don't care about the whole emo thing.

688
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:49,055
Scott: I don't really like their music.

689
00:43:49,276 --> 00:43:50,160
Scott: I don't like them.

690
00:43:50,281 --> 00:43:50,943
Scott: They don't bother me.

691
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:51,807
Scott: I don't bother them.

692
00:43:51,948 --> 00:43:53,415
Rym: It's all good I just don't.

693
00:43:53,456 --> 00:44:00,540
Rym: I mean when I was in middle school people like that They were called the angst definite article angst Mm-hmm, and there's been all these terms over the years.

694
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,890
Rym: and someday emo will fall away and people call them something else.

695
00:44:03,452 --> 00:44:04,818
Rym: It's it's nothing special.

696
00:44:04,838 --> 00:44:07,348
Rym: it's not anything to even bother having an opinion about in my opinion.

697
00:44:07,509 --> 00:44:11,409
Scott: Yep All right, Emma this Tomoe I asked where do babies come from women's vaginas?

698
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:16,461
Scott: Kremlin asks, how about Rym actually tell us his hidden screen names.

699
00:44:16,521 --> 00:44:16,661
Scott: Yeah.

700
00:44:16,681 --> 00:44:19,610
Scott: Okay, stop asking inside joke questions.

701
00:44:20,023 --> 00:44:20,571
Rym: Yes The.

702
00:44:20,611 --> 00:44:37,187
Rym: the deal there very briefly is that I went by a lot of screen names over the years and a long time ago I kind of I kind of dated a girl and she made a website that was about me and It's gone now, so you couldn't find it even if you look for it and there's really no like.

703
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:41,182
Rym: honestly You'd think there'd be a funny story there, but it's really not.

704
00:44:41,242 --> 00:44:43,370
Rym: and if I told you more details, it would be less amusing.

705
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:48,944
Scott: Kremlin asks, how about what Scott's rat last relationship experience with a mysterious woman?

706
00:44:49,024 --> 00:44:50,889
Scott: Stop asking inside joke questions again.

707
00:44:52,333 --> 00:44:53,469
Rym: Granted that's a funny story.

708
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:59,530
Scott: It's the thing about that story is the truth is pretty tame and unfunny except for when I got you.

709
00:44:59,711 --> 00:45:05,483
Scott: Yes, but yeah, but the The story around it that isn't true is much more interesting.

710
00:45:05,765 --> 00:45:07,190
Scott: Yeah, and that'll wait for geek fable.

711
00:45:07,511 --> 00:45:11,950
Rym: Yes, suffice to say Scott mayor may not have dated and/or slept with an international terrorist.

712
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:16,830
Scott: I didn't but the story is that I did so that's a much better story than a reality.

713
00:45:17,415 --> 00:45:28,788
Rym: Though going back to Kremlin's question I'll tell you this my first handle the first name I ever used on the great white internet in God, I had like prodigy was Origins.

714
00:45:29,911 --> 00:45:36,584
Rym: Mm-hmm, because I was sitting there and I was thinking I need a handle I'm about to go onto the internet for the first time ever.

715
00:45:36,604 --> 00:45:47,145
Rym: I was really excited I was really young and I looked around the room and we had this huge book on evolution this Giant book on like evolution and evolutionary theory and it was called origins.

716
00:45:47,446 --> 00:45:48,690
Rym: something something something something something.

717
00:45:49,052 --> 00:45:51,609
Rym: So I made that my handle and I used that for many years.

718
00:45:52,092 --> 00:45:56,830
Scott: My first one was taser which I stole from an old DOS game where you couldn't type a name.

719
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:59,924
Scott: You had to pick one of the pre-made names and I always picked taser.

720
00:45:59,964 --> 00:46:01,229
Scott: cuz that let you be the green guy.

721
00:46:01,912 --> 00:46:04,621
Scott: So my AOL name was taser three one four six.

722
00:46:04,781 --> 00:46:07,290
Scott: Oh and then eventually why three one four six?

723
00:46:07,451 --> 00:46:11,415
Scott: Oh, that was the number it gave me Back in the dial-up days.

724
00:46:11,957 --> 00:46:15,349
Scott: and then I played a mod on AOL called gemstone three and I got the name I use.

725
00:46:15,389 --> 00:46:16,454
Scott: now No one else uses it.

726
00:46:16,514 --> 00:46:17,036
Scott: It's my name.

727
00:46:17,076 --> 00:46:17,899
Rym: Haha a preachy.

728
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:20,590
Scott: Yeah, however, it has no official pronunciation.

729
00:46:21,971 --> 00:46:24,501
Scott: Our Bach asks, what size boobs do you like?

730
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:25,605

00:46:32,001 --> 00:46:33,429
Scott: Um, I like.

737
00:46:34,393 --> 00:46:35,236
Scott: You know the size.

738
00:46:35,416 --> 00:46:38,085
Scott: the gigantic boobs really are just kind of.

739
00:46:38,105 --> 00:46:39,390
Scott: I don't like him so much, you know.

740
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:46,110
Scott: But at the same time the ultra flatness is also kind of no good, you know, I mean I do like boobs.

741
00:46:46,772 --> 00:46:51,990
Scott: Yeah, I think my fate the best boobs for me are the ones that are they're spherical.

742
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:55,670
Scott: now I know they're not naturally spherical that there's a bra that makes them look spherical.

743
00:46:56,252 --> 00:47:01,166
Scott: But when there's like two perfect softballs with a tight shirt, that's good.

744
00:47:01,307 --> 00:47:01,728
Scott: I like that.

745
00:47:01,989 --> 00:47:07,210
Rym: now to me I really I like the aesthetic of like the 1920s flapper body type.

746
00:47:07,551 --> 00:47:10,742
Rym: I like like small kind of close to the chest like very pert breasts.

747
00:47:11,385 --> 00:47:12,850
Rym: I just I really I like that.

748
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:16,362
Rym: I like I like the whole frapper body type flapper.

749
00:47:17,165 --> 00:47:17,927
Rym: I can't really.

750
00:47:17,947 --> 00:47:18,690
Rym: yeah flapper.

751
00:47:19,192 --> 00:47:20,476
Rym: I was thinking about frapper maps.

752
00:47:20,857 --> 00:47:27,878
Rym: Yeah, but I really I can't say any more without embarrassing either Emily or people I know.

753
00:47:27,898 --> 00:47:29,527
Rym: so I'm just going to leave it at that.

754
00:47:30,672 --> 00:47:33,002
Scott: Ninja Ned asked as a recent high school graduate.

755
00:47:33,022 --> 00:47:35,110
Scott: I was wondering what you think is the best way to prepare for college.

756
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:38,509
Scott: You already talked about deciding if you if college is even right for you.

757
00:47:38,992 --> 00:47:41,830
Scott: But if you have decided college is right for you and you want to prepare.

758
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:46,077
Scott: first You should figure out.

759
00:47:46,277 --> 00:47:55,830
Scott: you should make sure you got your shit down know how to register for classes Know your way around the school meet people at the school join clubs at the school.

760
00:47:56,753 --> 00:48:01,409
Scott: Make sure you don't forget any things, you know, you bring your mini fridge and all your college stuff.

761
00:48:02,633 --> 00:48:07,247
Scott: Make sure you call your roommate a few times before you go to college if they assigned you a dorm roommate.

762
00:48:07,588 --> 00:48:22,320
Rym: more importantly Because all the material stuff you'll figure out I Am fairly certain that once you get to college and meet real people and normal people you're you're going to lose touch with almost everyone you knew in high school and You should.

763
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:29,389
Rym: yes There are rare exceptions where you will still be good friends with someone from your high school Once you get to college.

764
00:48:29,811 --> 00:48:31,858
Rym: Don't try to cling to high school.

765
00:48:32,199 --> 00:48:35,689
Rym: the people who try to cling to their hometown tend to have a lot of trouble with college.

766
00:48:37,075 --> 00:48:39,955
Rym: Yep, all right I'm gonna go with one now.

767
00:48:40,657 --> 00:48:44,669
Rym: now baltimatrix has a question or a bunch of questions in a row and we'll just hit them all.

768
00:48:45,516 --> 00:48:47,652
Rym: These are kind of random one.

769
00:48:48,033 --> 00:48:49,437
Rym: which superpower would you take?

770
00:48:49,457 --> 00:48:52,665
Rym: the ability to fly or the ability to turn invisible?

771
00:48:52,805 --> 00:49:02,168
Rym: and then he has a note with all the You know provides those About whether yeah, like you can't fly into space your clothes turn invisible with you that sort of thing.

772
00:49:02,369 --> 00:49:04,797
Rym: Yep I Would take the ability to fly.

773
00:49:04,897 --> 00:49:06,910
Rym: I've been fascinated with flight my whole life.

774
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:11,770
Rym: I'd love nothing more than to have some sort of genetic thing where they can inject me and I'd have giant feathered wings.

775
00:49:12,231 --> 00:49:12,934
Rym: But that's just me.

776
00:49:13,556 --> 00:49:16,226
Scott: I would if only I had flying and invisibility.

777
00:49:16,306 --> 00:49:22,750
Scott: I would all I would take invisibility but if I had my choice, I would take teleportation.

778
00:49:23,272 --> 00:49:24,978
Scott: Well, it's because the flying for me.

779
00:49:24,998 --> 00:49:28,210
Scott: I could get the flying experience by skydiving.

780
00:49:28,511 --> 00:49:35,570
Scott: The flying really is about the transportation and flying isn't really any better than walking or running or driving.

781
00:49:35,711 --> 00:49:38,325
Rym: Yes airplanes one, you know quickly I could get to my work.

782
00:49:38,787 --> 00:49:39,270
Scott: That's true.

783
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:42,123
Scott: But at the same time teleportation is really what I would want.

784
00:49:42,465 --> 00:49:46,850
Scott: but invisibility versus the slightly faster transportation of flying.

785
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:55,539
Scott: Invisibility has all kinds of great uses sneaking into places sneaking out of places Stealing shit.

786
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,064
Scott: Yeah.

787
00:49:56,306 --> 00:50:05,190
Rym: All right bender Yeah See, I guess if if it was the choice between these two while I could do more with invisibility I choose flying just cuz I've been fascinated with it my whole life.

788
00:50:05,431 --> 00:50:06,395
Rym: I I would law.

789
00:50:06,475 --> 00:50:10,330
Rym: I just couldn't imagine the feeling of just like jumping off of an embankment and flying away.

790
00:50:10,691 --> 00:50:12,236
Scott: We'll just go skydiving then.

791
00:50:12,678 --> 00:50:14,725
Rym: Yeah, actually I plan to sometime in the future.

792
00:50:14,905 --> 00:50:16,230
Rym: Yeah, I've been bungee jumping.

793
00:50:16,371 --> 00:50:18,480
Rym: It's amazing, but just flight I think is neat.

794
00:50:19,063 --> 00:50:23,709
Rym: now if I had the choice of any super ability I would want the ability to cast spells and be some sort of mage.

795
00:50:24,332 --> 00:50:25,636
Scott: That's so cheating.

796
00:50:25,656 --> 00:50:26,559
Scott: why cuz?

797
00:50:26,579 --> 00:50:30,030
Scott: then you could teleport and fly and turn invisible.

798
00:50:30,211 --> 00:50:38,470
Rym: I've been the ability to transform my body because then I could turn into a snake to hide but I can also grow myself wings and fly Right.

799
00:50:41,394 --> 00:50:42,358
Rym: I can pick superpowers.

800
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:49,970
Rym: All right, and this question I think is interesting If - if you never went into computers, what course of study would you have taken?

801
00:50:51,371 --> 00:51:00,243
Rym: I personally almost I really considered going into music instead of into computing and It was really the money and the fact that RIT had a good internet connection that swayed me.

802
00:51:00,945 --> 00:51:01,106
Scott: Yep.

803
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:10,883
Scott: I might have done something like electrical engineering or mechanical engineering or microelectronic engineering now if I.

804
00:51:10,924 --> 00:51:11,125
Rym: but

805
00:51:11,205 --> 00:51:18,379
Scott: I also might have done something more artsy like Writing or something or something like that

806
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:31,098
Rym: if I knew then what I know now, I might have tried to go into radio If I knew then what I knew now and I could somehow have still had the RIT experience But yet gotten my education elsewhere.

807
00:51:31,118 --> 00:51:34,170
Rym: I would have taken that scholarship to Oxford and I would have gotten a law degree.

808
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:39,770
Scott: It does really matter and this relates to his last question if I knew early enough, I would be a race car driver.

809
00:51:40,466 --> 00:51:46,545
Scott: Yeah Because you would have told me when I was in like elementary school that there were go-karts I could drive and that's how to become a race car driver.

810
00:51:46,947 --> 00:51:50,406
Scott: I would be Probably racing f1 right now or be close to it.

811
00:51:50,909 --> 00:51:55,129
Rym: Yep I mean to me the college I went to mattered more than the degree I got.

812
00:51:55,491 --> 00:51:58,766
Rym: So I went into computing because that was the degree that RIT offered.

813
00:51:58,806 --> 00:51:59,228
Rym: that was good.

814
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:06,350
Scott: Yeah, I pretty much was gonna do computer science no matter where I went but everywhere offered computer science even the state school.

815
00:52:06,772 --> 00:52:10,068
Scott: So it was just you know, a matter of picking the college and RIT was the one.

816
00:52:10,389 --> 00:52:12,989
Rym: Yep I didn't even decide on IT until I got to RIT.

817
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:16,041
Scott: Yeah I wasn't sure if I was gonna do IT or CS a hundred percent.

818
00:52:16,162 --> 00:52:20,421
Scott: as soon as I realized there were alternatives to CS I was deciding between IT and computer engineering.

819
00:52:20,662 --> 00:52:22,089
Rym: Yep, which I'm glad I didn't go into.

820
00:52:22,296 --> 00:52:23,212
Rym: Yeah though.

821
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:32,470
Rym: actually I'm considering now getting a law degree and I've been looking at a lot of online or night classes and in that in The years to come I may become a lawyer in some fashion.

822
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:36,110
Scott: Yeah, while I wouldn't want to be a lawyer, I would want to be a judge.

823
00:52:36,352 --> 00:52:43,410
Rym: I want to be a lawyer as a Leaping stone into politics and into all sorts of industries that I currently don't have access.

824
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:45,768
Scott: Yeah, being a judge or a detective would have been cool.

825
00:52:46,931 --> 00:52:52,010
Rym: Three this question is kind of mad, but if money was no object, what car would you purchase?

826
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:53,333
Scott: well that all depends.

827
00:52:53,874 --> 00:52:59,919
Scott: see it depends if you're asking for a day-to-day car or a race car a tank kind of car.

828
00:52:59,939 --> 00:53:03,237
Rym: if From a pure game theory perspective.

829
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:09,702
Rym: I should pick an Enzo Ferrari or an f1 car sell it get the money buy the car I actually want and then have a pile of money.

830
00:53:09,782 --> 00:53:10,870
Scott: Well money is no object.

831
00:53:11,011 --> 00:53:13,750
Rym: So yeah, but maybe money is no object only for buying a car.

832
00:53:13,931 --> 00:53:15,701
Rym: Maybe I could turn that yeah money and all.

833
00:53:15,741 --> 00:53:24,620
Scott: if I wanted to get the best car I would get a 2004 f1 Ferrari the one that Michael Schumacher drove to win the championship because that is probably the fastest best f1 Car there is?

834
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,698
Rym: yeah But I say we're Fernando Alonso's current car.

835
00:53:28,099 --> 00:53:34,003
Rym: if we could just if we were just buying a car and money didn't really matter like we Could finance any car we wanted to make it a more reasonable question.

836
00:53:34,104 --> 00:53:35,290
Scott: the car for everyday use?

837
00:53:35,611 --> 00:53:42,663
Rym: Yeah, just like if I could just walk out and buy a car right now the way I just went and bought that Mac I'd either buy like a z3 or a Miata.

838
00:53:43,205 --> 00:53:54,849
Scott: I would either get a Nissan Skyline GTR or I would get a Ferrari the current one the 355 the one that's out now spider because it's yeah too cool.

839
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:58,180
Scott: I was GTR man because you don't see GTRs on the road.

840
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,828
Scott: They're not street-legal in the US, but god damn.

841
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:03,249
Rym: yep I just like really little zoomy cars.

842
00:54:04,113 --> 00:54:05,859
Scott: For how much wood can a woodchuck check?

843
00:54:06,261 --> 00:54:08,188
Scott: it can chuck less than Chuck Norris can check.

844
00:54:08,589 --> 00:54:10,977
Rym: yep My alternate answer is that's a stupid question.

845
00:54:11,077 --> 00:54:12,401
Rym: You're a stupid person for asking it.

846
00:54:13,003 --> 00:54:14,969
Scott: five rally or f1 and why?

847
00:54:15,049 --> 00:54:19,564
Scott: well It's not really a matter of or it's a matter of which one right now.

848
00:54:19,765 --> 00:54:21,430
Rym: I like them both for their own merits.

849
00:54:21,811 --> 00:54:26,690
Rym: I like f1 more now because it's more accessible to me, and it's easier to watch and I enjoy watching it a lot.

850
00:54:26,971 --> 00:54:34,580
Scott: Yep, rally is more about drivers skill and crazy downhill racing But the technical stuff.

851
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,047
Scott: and rally isn't that interesting.

852
00:54:36,067 --> 00:54:39,150
Scott: f1 I'm really interested in the technical side of it.

853
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:44,578
Scott: So it really grabs my interest and also the driver Personalities and and all that sort of thing.

854
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,604
Scott: if rally was more accessible.

855
00:54:46,625 --> 00:54:54,738
Scott: I would watch that too But it really isn't and I don't really have time to watch another racing sport, so Yeah, all right now.

856
00:54:54,759 --> 00:55:01,690
Rym: They had asked and I think this is a very good question Quoting I submit to you that real life is just like a very complex German board game.

857
00:55:02,113 --> 00:55:04,130
Rym: Clearly both Rym and Scott are outstanding gamers.

858
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:10,350
Rym: Therefore those gaming skills should transfer to real life enabling them to acquire much power and wealth in the real life game.

859
00:55:10,792 --> 00:55:16,495
Rym: So the question and it's the one that plagues Mensa members ever it doesn't plague Mensa members everywhere That's the members.

860
00:55:16,515 --> 00:55:18,670
Rym: I have my opinions on Mensa, but that's a whole lot.

861
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:19,833
Scott: That's another who have like that.

862
00:55:20,154 --> 00:55:23,826
Rym: why aren't Rym and Scott rich and powerful in real life, okay?

863
00:55:23,866 --> 00:55:31,320
Scott: Let's start by saying Okay, you might be able to say that life is German board game But there's a problem and a German board game.

864
00:55:31,441 --> 00:55:36,138
Scott: everyone starts on equal footing and has the same opportunities with minimal randomness.

865
00:55:36,379 --> 00:55:41,216
Rym: a better way to phrase the question would be life can be viewed from the Perspective of game theory?

866
00:55:41,357 --> 00:55:44,409
Scott: yes, but the thing is is that life as a game?

867
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:45,611
Scott: Isn't as?

868
00:55:45,792 --> 00:55:48,781
Scott: even as a German board game everyone starts out on different footings.

869
00:55:48,842 --> 00:55:53,081
Scott: some people might start out as the president's son some people Start out homeless in the ghetto.

870
00:55:53,645 --> 00:55:54,430
Scott: so there you go.

871
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:58,230
Scott: We started out in the suburban America, which is sort of middle-of-the-road.

872
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:01,764
Scott: Secondly there's a lot of randomness in life.

873
00:56:01,804 --> 00:56:02,670
Scott: shit just happens.

874
00:56:02,891 --> 00:56:12,130
Scott: I mean I could just go down to a casino bet my entire everything I own on black on the casino and possibly double my wealth on a roulette wheel.

875
00:56:12,631 --> 00:56:17,670
Scott: This you know, but that's an example of sort of a game of chance in your life, but there's other chance in real life.

876
00:56:17,771 --> 00:56:19,037
Scott: I mean some.

877
00:56:19,077 --> 00:56:21,570
Scott: I might find a bar of gold in the backyard.

878
00:56:21,791 --> 00:56:24,882
Rym: You might just trip on the streets of New York City fall on a spike and die.

879
00:56:25,223 --> 00:56:27,405
Scott: you might step on an electrified manhole and die.

880
00:56:28,413 --> 00:56:36,210
Scott: It's like imagine if you're playing a board game And there's a deck of cards and everyone draws the cards and some cards say you win some cards say you lose.

881
00:56:36,451 --> 00:56:37,558
Scott: They say all kinds of things.

882
00:56:37,678 --> 00:56:42,765
Scott: it doesn't really matter how good you are at games If there's that much randomness as there is in the real world.

883
00:56:43,107 --> 00:56:47,261
Rym: now three Game theory has been plagued by this problem for as long as it's existed.

884
00:56:47,301 --> 00:56:58,550
Rym: and the problem is that game theory in general the the equations assume that Everyone involved is acting to one to a common goal to a similar utility.

885
00:56:58,912 --> 00:57:01,503
Rym: But in the real world people have very different utility.

886
00:57:01,563 --> 00:57:03,050
Rym: utility is what you want out of the game.

887
00:57:03,352 --> 00:57:04,197
Rym: Some people want to be happy.

888
00:57:04,217 --> 00:57:04,901
Rym: Some people want money.

889
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:05,606
Rym: Some people want power.

890
00:57:05,626 --> 00:57:06,230
Rym: Some people want sex.

891
00:57:06,513 --> 00:57:07,830
Rym: Some people want to just take drugs and die.

892
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:08,251
Rym: There's.

893
00:57:08,613 --> 00:57:13,750
Rym: there's so many different things people want that everyone's playing a different game to right along these lines.

894
00:57:14,552 --> 00:57:20,070
Rym: It assumes that people act rationally in order to achieve their goals and that they learn from their mistakes.

895
00:57:20,655 --> 00:57:35,274
Rym: and the problem with this is that Not to disparage humankind but sociology is showed empirically that as a herd humans act against their own best interests and will often act contrary to their own goals for No reason at all.

896
00:57:35,375 --> 00:57:46,969
Scott: people who a lot of you will just don't know what they want and people who do know what they want Often don't know how to get it or Fail to or do know how to get it and fail to do what they know they got to do out of laziness or who?

897
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:47,732
Scott: Knows what?

898
00:57:48,295 --> 00:57:51,570
Scott: so it's really hard especially because there's some German board games.

899
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:54,024
Scott: You can affect other players and there's someone you can't.

900
00:57:54,507 --> 00:58:00,210
Scott: in life Anyone can pretty much affect anyone in almost any way depending on how well they're currently doing at the game.

901
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:03,630
Rym: It's a game of Tigers and Euphrates where everyone has a million catastrophes.

902
00:58:04,192 --> 00:58:10,089
Scott: Yeah, so it's really hard to win in a game because there are a lot of things I know I could do to get ahead right now.

903
00:58:10,471 --> 00:58:16,250
Scott: But I also know that if I did those things people would throw catastrophes at me and I'd be worse off than when I started.

904
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:23,649
Rym: Now also, here's our second half of the answer Which is the more this is part you actually wanted to hear because we went on about game theory and all that.

905
00:58:24,653 --> 00:58:31,142
Rym: This is a life is a game Where you I mean let's consider a game like Carcassonne or Timbuktu.

906
00:58:31,744 --> 00:58:33,749
Rym: if you play you could play the game optimally.

907
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:36,017
Rym: Yeah, meaning no matter what's going on.

908
00:58:36,057 --> 00:58:39,749
Rym: You were playing the best game you can play with the pieces you've got.

909
00:58:40,512 --> 00:58:47,910
Rym: despite that you might still lose because if other people have better pieces or Everyone's playing optimally and the game just comes down to chance.

910
00:58:48,331 --> 00:58:54,053
Rym: You could finish a game that you lost and know that is the best I could have done in any circumstances Mm-hmm.

911
00:58:54,415 --> 00:59:03,583
Rym: And secondly, we actually honestly are More rich and more powerful than the vast majority of humans have ever been.

912
00:59:03,603 --> 00:59:06,030
Rym: that is that is not a conceded statement.

913
00:59:06,351 --> 00:59:12,550
Rym: The vast majority of humanity throughout all of history and today has lived in utter squalor and filth compared to what we do.

914
00:59:12,951 --> 00:59:14,720
Rym: We have a podcast that people listen to.

915
00:59:15,082 --> 00:59:16,810
Rym: we have a six-figure income.

916
00:59:17,152 --> 00:59:18,904
Rym: We live in a wonderful free country.

917
00:59:19,105 --> 00:59:20,392
Rym: for the most part We.

918
00:59:20,613 --> 00:59:24,907
Rym: we have luxuries that are unheard of to most people humans who have ever existed.

919
00:59:25,208 --> 00:59:25,750
Scott: think about this.

920
00:59:25,992 --> 00:59:30,890
Scott: I can send a message and To publish it to everyone in the world.

921
00:59:31,492 --> 00:59:34,259
Scott: Most people who are alive today can't do that.

922
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:37,367
Scott: Do you understand how much power we have right now?

923
00:59:37,488 --> 00:59:38,290
Scott: It's insane.

924
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:45,970
Scott: We have more power in our little dinky house without a basement because an old lady living down there than most humans have ever had.

925
00:59:46,351 --> 00:59:57,950
Rym: I mean the fact that I can right now talk to my girlfriend Emily who's in Nagoya Japan just on a whim and yet there are people in Africa who can't get a message to the neighboring village and

926
00:59:58,890 --> 01:00:10,190
Scott: On the same token I could go down, you know, evilly I'm not gonna say I would do this because I'd probably go to jail but you know It is possible that we have the ability to make bombs and blow lots of things up.

927
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:14,910
Scott: We're not going to nor would we but there we have a lot of power to do many things.

928
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:18,005
Scott: There are a lot of cards in our hands that we're not playing.

929
01:00:18,045 --> 01:00:24,730
Rym: for various reasons Like for example Palestine just as an example, they have no actual military power.

930
01:00:25,071 --> 01:00:29,445
Rym: They have no normal conventional way to exert force upon on people.

931
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:30,910
Rym: They have very little technology.

932
01:00:31,393 --> 01:00:33,005
Rym: They would normally be irrelevant.

933
01:00:33,367 --> 01:00:39,610
Rym: However Individual determined people can very very greatly affect the world if they so choose.

934
01:00:40,172 --> 01:00:46,049
Rym: I'm not agreeing with what a suicide bomber does but being a suicide bomber is a very powerful thing.

935
01:00:46,651 --> 01:00:50,499
Scott: people can have a large effect on the giant game board that is the world.

936
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:59,198
Scott: and You know, we just think about what we can do and we do the best we can Considering our laziness and desires

937
01:00:59,499 --> 01:01:13,120
Rym: and I really think in terms of how what life has handed us and what we've done we are about we're doing as well and being as powerful and as influential and as rich as We can be without violating our own morals and ethical codes

938
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:16,630
Scott: or without taking unnecessarily crazy risks.

939
01:01:17,272 --> 01:01:22,510
Scott: I mean there are crazy risks we could take to like suddenly shoot to the top, but it's just not worth the risk.

940
01:01:22,811 --> 01:01:37,724
Scott: Yeah, and there are things I could do to be much more powerful that I just don't feel ethically okay with doing Yep, or there are things that we could do to become much more powerful But then other things would happen as a side effect that I don't want.

941
01:01:37,845 --> 01:01:39,570
Scott: so I have to go about it a different way.

942
01:01:40,378 --> 01:01:50,068
Rym: So to answer your question I think we are actually doing very well and we are applying game theory to our lives both consciously and unconsciously to great effect.

943
01:01:51,179 --> 01:01:53,355
Scott: alright What is on?

944
01:01:53,395 --> 01:01:55,585
Scott: Lindsay says what aren't you guys good at?

945
01:01:55,666 --> 01:01:56,610
Scott: there must be something?

946
01:01:56,871 --> 01:01:59,004
Rym: Alright, neither one of us can draw for a shit.

947
01:01:59,125 --> 01:02:00,930
Rym: I can draw stick figures I can't even do that.

948
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:06,272
Scott: I tried to learn to draw once with this little how to draw manga book and I kind of stopped pretty quickly because I was Terrible.

949
01:02:06,614 --> 01:02:09,670
Rym: Yeah, neither one of us can sing at all can't sing.

950
01:02:10,053 --> 01:02:17,690
Rym: I mean I can almost Kind of sing one Bob Seger song because he only uses like three notes and even that is pretty piss poor.

951
01:02:18,011 --> 01:02:19,375
Scott: I can't really rollers.

952
01:02:19,475 --> 01:02:23,347
Scott: skate Rym can but I really I am kind of terrible at roller skate.

953
01:02:23,367 --> 01:02:24,490
Scott: I just roll the blade.

954
01:02:25,172 --> 01:02:30,470
Rym: I'm a. I haven't rollerbladed recently just because there's no real good sidewalks around here, but I was a super avid rollerblader.

955
01:02:30,873 --> 01:02:38,730
Rym: I can't roller skate at all But I can rollerblade like you wouldn't believe and I can't really do any sort of skating or bleeding.

956
01:02:39,011 --> 01:02:41,020
Rym: Yeah, though if you want to learn yeah, I could.

957
01:02:41,361 --> 01:02:44,634
Scott: I've never skied so I don't know how I'm good at it But I probably won't ski.

958
01:02:44,815 --> 01:02:46,060
Rym: you should skings really fun.

959
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,205
Scott: No, it's super dangerous.

960
01:02:47,245 --> 01:02:49,534
Rym: I'll teach you it's really not hard It's not that dangerous.

961
01:02:49,735 --> 01:02:51,442
Scott: I think I'm gonna stay away from the super dangerous.

962
01:02:51,543 --> 01:02:52,627
Rym: It's not dangerous.

963
01:02:52,728 --> 01:02:53,190
Scott: Yeah, it is.

964
01:02:53,350 --> 01:02:57,465
Rym: It's only dangerous if you do the crazy skiing that I never really did to any great extent.

965
01:02:57,666 --> 01:02:58,569
Scott: Yeah, it's not worth it.

966
01:02:59,794 --> 01:03:00,847
Scott: What else aren't we good at?

967
01:03:02,213 --> 01:03:04,050
Rym: Well, you played the guitar a little bit, but you're not very music.

968
01:03:04,118 --> 01:03:10,350
Scott: No I played guitar in fifth grade and then I played the clarinet in sixth seventh eighth and ninth grade and I haven't played music since.

969
01:03:10,835 --> 01:03:17,610
Scott: Like I can read music You know if I if you gave me like a music book and an instrument and within like a day I could be back to.

970
01:03:17,731 --> 01:03:24,010
Scott: You know average, but I'm not super musical But I'd say I'm better than most people when it comes to music.

971
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:27,379
Rym: This will sound weird and please let me finish before you yell at me.

972
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:30,206
Rym: I'm not good at lying now.

973
01:03:30,667 --> 01:03:31,630
Rym: what I mean by that?

974
01:03:32,472 --> 01:03:36,645
Rym: What I mean by that is that I am very good at telling stories.

975
01:03:36,906 --> 01:03:38,390
Rym: I'm very good at exaggerating.

976
01:03:38,450 --> 01:03:44,770
Rym: I'm very good at taking an otherwise mundane event and turning it into an amazing story However, which Scott says is lying.

977
01:03:44,951 --> 01:03:55,270
Rym: However, what I cannot do at all and it bothers me because I'd want to and I think I have good ideas sometimes But I just can't pull it off is I can't come up with a story from nothing.

978
01:03:55,912 --> 01:03:57,479
Rym: Like if there's any grain of.

979
01:03:57,660 --> 01:04:03,663
Rym: if I ever tell a story no matter how outlandish it may seem There is a grain of truth in there somewhere because I need that grain of truth.

980
01:04:04,065 --> 01:04:06,735
Rym: if there's no truth to it at all I just can't do it.

981
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:08,742
Rym: I can't tell the story.

982
01:04:09,043 --> 01:04:10,107
Rym: I can't make up the lie.

983
01:04:10,147 --> 01:04:10,830
Rym: I just can't do it.

984
01:04:11,272 --> 01:04:14,255
Scott: Yeah, I have a lot of trouble if I try to write fiction Maybe it's cuz.

985
01:04:14,315 --> 01:04:29,330
Scott: no I haven't figured out how it's done But I can't really just come up with a good story out of nothing I end up either stealing a bunch of parts of existing stories I know or writing nonfiction or who knows but I really can't write fiction very well

986
01:04:30,551 --> 01:04:31,034
Rym: There are a lot of

987
01:04:31,094 --> 01:04:31,556
Scott: other things.

988
01:04:31,596 --> 01:04:32,541
Scott: I'm not good at like.

989
01:04:32,581 --> 01:04:34,250
Scott: I'm not good at dentistry.

990
01:04:35,451 --> 01:04:36,956
Scott: I'm not good at surgery.

991
01:04:37,036 --> 01:04:41,250
Rym: Although I probably could be but I would just boggle as much as I like to play around with electronics.

992
01:04:41,672 --> 01:04:48,010
Rym: I'm not that good at soldering and while I can passively solder something I often burn myself and I often make really poor joy.

993
01:04:48,170 --> 01:04:57,686
Scott: I don't burn myself and I can solder in a way that works, but I also make pretty poor Solders, you know big blobs instead of nice little dots.

994
01:04:58,188 --> 01:05:02,308
Scott: Yeah I think if someone showed me the right method and I practiced for an hour, I'd be down.

995
01:05:02,348 --> 01:05:05,648
Scott: though There are plenty other things that we're not good at.

996
01:05:06,332 --> 01:05:10,150
Rym: Yeah, we just we're not gonna list everything in the world that we're not good at.

997
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:12,176
Scott: I'm generally good at crafts and not good at arts.

998
01:05:12,196 --> 01:05:13,079
Scott: It's like painting.

999
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:16,790
Scott: No good putting together something or making a little tiny race car.

1000
01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:17,172
Scott: Very good.

1001
01:05:17,935 --> 01:05:18,116
Rym: Yep.

1002
01:05:18,718 --> 01:05:18,999
Rym: All right.

1003
01:05:19,281 --> 01:05:20,184
Rym: Let's see what other questions.

1004
01:05:20,204 --> 01:05:20,666
Rym: we're running low.

1005
01:05:20,686 --> 01:05:21,410
Rym: We've done most of them.

1006
01:05:21,811 --> 01:05:28,674
Rym: All right, here's an interesting one by thorn and I. we can't go into great detail on this because most of you don't care To paraphrase.

1007
01:05:28,855 --> 01:05:34,023
Rym: this probably isn't a good question for the show, but it seemed a good place to ask You mentioned a few times you've been to penguin con.

1008
01:05:34,566 --> 01:05:35,130
Rym: when were you there?

1009
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:37,235
Rym: Did you board game there?

1010
01:05:37,255 --> 01:05:42,418
Rym: I might have met you depending on which one you went to To make an actual question.

1011
01:05:42,819 --> 01:05:44,445
Rym: What do you think of penguin con?

1012
01:05:44,465 --> 01:05:46,070
Rym: What do you think of these unified cons?

1013
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:47,603
Rym: You know where there's more than one thing at it.

1014
01:05:47,623 --> 01:05:48,310
Rym: Would you go again?

1015
01:05:48,590 --> 01:05:50,296
Scott: We went to penguin con 2.0.

1016
01:05:50,296 --> 01:05:54,690
Scott: I believe the one where Neil Gaiman and Steve Jackson and who else was there?

1017
01:05:55,450 --> 01:05:56,053
Rym: Rob MALDA.

1018
01:05:56,174 --> 01:05:57,319
Scott: Rob MALDA was there.

1019
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:59,329
Scott: It was a cool Mozilla guy was there.

1020
01:05:59,631 --> 01:06:01,041
Rym: It was an amazing amazing con.

1021
01:06:01,383 --> 01:06:08,470
Rym: at least we had a lot of fun But I had a lot of fun at that and honestly we probably would have gone back every year because Novi Michigan is only about four hours from rock.

1022
01:06:08,490 --> 01:06:09,253
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't see.

1023
01:06:09,314 --> 01:06:15,510
Scott: I've looked at the websites for future penguin cons, but they didn't seem to have the guests line up But I still probably would have gone back in future years.

1024
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:21,430
Rym: The only reason we don't go is that instead of being four hours away Novi is now nine hours away.

1025
01:06:21,972 --> 01:06:23,016
Scott: That con was closer.

1026
01:06:23,076 --> 01:06:24,742
Scott: We would have kept going to it, but it's not.

1027
01:06:24,863 --> 01:06:29,359
Rym: in fact if jetblue flew to Detroit We might have been inclined to go but it's not.

1028
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:35,184
Rym: it's actually very expensive to fly to Detroit from where we are Because not many people do so now.

1029
01:06:35,807 --> 01:06:37,958
Scott: in the future We might go to a penguin con.

1030
01:06:38,139 --> 01:06:39,707
Scott: if you know, they turn out to be that much.

1031
01:06:39,868 --> 01:06:42,709
Rym: Awesome If penguin con will pay our way will be guests.

1032
01:06:43,293 --> 01:06:47,910
Scott: Oh as we should send a letter to penguin con asking, you know Actually could we could kill a bunch of birds in one stone?

1033
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:51,248
Rym: I could go visit my family and then we could do a show and yep.

1034
01:06:52,041 --> 01:07:02,390
Scott: But yeah we will tell the story of what happened to that penguin con in a geek fables episode in the future because There are many tales from that penguin con because it was really that awesome.

1035
01:07:03,371 --> 01:07:03,713
Rym: All right.

1036
01:07:04,055 --> 01:07:06,607
Rym: We've only got two or three more questions left here.

1037
01:07:06,628 --> 01:07:12,675
Rym: Cool There's a couple more on the forums, but they came kind of late and they weren't too interesting So I just kind of skipped him.

1038
01:07:13,017 --> 01:07:13,901
Scott: All right, it's all you.

1039
01:07:13,921 --> 01:07:15,449
Rym: All right, there's two more questions here.

1040
01:07:16,435 --> 01:07:18,650
Rym: Well, this question is good because I think we can talk about it a lot.

1041
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:23,169
Rym: And then I saved the best question for last because I think it's really cool that this guy listens to us.

1042
01:07:23,471 --> 01:07:29,270
Rym: Mm-hmm one Balta matrix asked what do you guys do to prepare or to do a panel at cons?

1043
01:07:29,773 --> 01:07:35,435
Rym: I asked because I'm thinking of doing a panel at a con in 2007.

1044
01:07:35,435 --> 01:07:42,059
Rym: I will say right now that I Personally don't prepare at all for any public speaking.

1045
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:44,705
Rym: I ever do see me.

1046
01:07:46,112 --> 01:07:55,209
Scott: When I was learning public speaking in my last year of high school I learned the lesson that if I prepare it's wicked awesome And if I don't prepare it's not wicked awesome.

1047
01:07:55,735 --> 01:08:11,130
Scott: But my preparations Over time have required less and less and less and after doing this podcast it really I can just write the Sparsest of notes like in two seconds and I'm good to go and even then I don't even need that most of the time.

1048
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:17,550
Rym: Yep, I mean, I guess I didn't go through that with the podcast just because I've done a lot of extemporaneous speaking in my life.

1049
01:08:17,993 --> 01:08:19,729
Rym: I mean I gave speeches in high school.

1050
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:23,303
Scott: Well, see I always I had the speaking skill and it came out when I prepared.

1051
01:08:23,344 --> 01:08:26,161
Scott: like remember when we were freshmen I ran for anime club.

1052
01:08:26,383 --> 01:08:27,130
Rym: Yeah, you almost won.

1053
01:08:27,331 --> 01:08:28,536
Scott: Yeah, see cuz they I had.

1054
01:08:28,555 --> 01:08:32,818
Scott: I was using my public speaking skills for my last year of high school And then I hadn't.

1055
01:08:32,898 --> 01:08:33,442
Scott: they gave her.

1056
01:08:33,502 --> 01:08:34,086
Scott: it's like a muscle.

1057
01:08:34,145 --> 01:08:34,629
Scott: I didn't flex.

1058
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:36,910
Rym: Yeah, I mean my only point is that I started earlier than you.

1059
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:41,719
Rym: That's the only reason that I cuz I went through the same thing I used to prepare and as I did it so much.

1060
01:08:41,738 --> 01:08:47,545
Rym: She's got to the point where give me literally you could come up to us like we could have a panel the anything panel.

1061
01:08:47,606 --> 01:08:55,010
Rym: we could sit there and Random people could walk up and say you must do this panel on X and I think we could pull off a damn good panel.

1062
01:08:55,692 --> 01:09:10,310
Scott: Yeah, pretty much no matter what X was unless it was something so complicated that we had no knowledge of whatsoever like a very specific physics topic like Super string theory something something something then we wouldn't know what to talk about but we could look it up on Wikipedia real quick.

1063
01:09:10,932 --> 01:09:11,314
Rym: I mean like.

1064
01:09:11,395 --> 01:09:20,693
Rym: I took a lot of public speaking and communications classes at university as well And I even entered in some public speaking contests and I really didn't prepare it all Like at all.

1065
01:09:20,734 --> 01:09:25,729
Rym: the most I would ever carry with me is if say I had to cite something I had to talk about something very specific.

1066
01:09:26,152 --> 01:09:30,970
Rym: I might have one index card with just the name like the actual citation because I'm not gonna remember that.

1067
01:09:31,411 --> 01:09:35,383
Scott: Yeah, like who said the quote or what book it's from on what page?

1068
01:09:35,764 --> 01:09:37,810
Rym: but we literally will sit down at a panel.

1069
01:09:38,212 --> 01:09:40,203
Rym: Well me because I got hasn't actually done a panel yet.

1070
01:09:40,224 --> 01:09:40,988
Rym: This is his first one.

1071
01:09:41,712 --> 01:09:45,629
Scott: But well, that's my second panel at a car at an anime kind of oh, yeah an anime con.

1072
01:09:46,412 --> 01:09:49,019
Rym: But I've done I've done God 15 or 20.

1073
01:09:49,019 --> 01:09:50,183
Rym: I just sit down and go.

1074
01:09:50,203 --> 01:09:52,488
Rym: I really don't even sketch anything out at all.

1075
01:09:53,111 --> 01:09:58,190
Rym: Uh, I don't recommend you do that unless you were very comfortable in your extemporaneous speaking skills.

1076
01:09:59,372 --> 01:10:02,830
Rym: I don't really have any good advice as to how to prepare because I we don't.

1077
01:10:03,970 --> 01:10:06,681
Scott: Yeah Alright, I'll read the last question.

1078
01:10:06,701 --> 01:10:08,210
Rym: Alright, cuz I think I like this question.

1079
01:10:08,391 --> 01:10:11,143
Scott: This is from Robert and he said I'm gonna read the whole thing.

1080
01:10:11,324 --> 01:10:12,590
Scott: Alright, I love your show.

1081
01:10:12,810 --> 01:10:14,356
Scott: I have been listening for about five months.

1082
01:10:14,416 --> 01:10:16,442
Scott: That was an excellent use of semicolon by the way.

1083
01:10:17,044 --> 01:10:17,747
Rym: Yes.

1084
01:10:17,847 --> 01:10:18,710
Rym: It is a lost art.

1085
01:10:19,492 --> 01:10:21,883
Scott: I try to listen every day, but I'm not an anime fan.

1086
01:10:22,024 --> 01:10:23,350
Scott: I like comics but not anime.

1087
01:10:23,471 --> 01:10:25,264
Scott: So some Wednesdays, I only listen to the beginning.

1088
01:10:25,526 --> 01:10:25,929
Scott: That's cool.

1089
01:10:26,911 --> 01:10:29,410
Scott: I'm in the military and I recently was shipped overseas.

1090
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:40,790
Scott: There was a time where I was not able to log on to iTunes for over three weeks in the travel here before I got My first chance to download your new episodes and 12 episodes downloaded at once and it took a very long time.

1091
01:10:41,171 --> 01:10:45,049
Scott: But I had to spend the next few days doing things where I'm able to keep my iPad with me.

1092
01:10:45,553 --> 01:10:47,710
Scott: So I listen to all those episodes in the span of three days.

1093
01:10:47,851 --> 01:10:52,390
Scott: Oh, you started out with such a great semicolon and then you had what can only be called a run-on sentence.

1094
01:10:52,892 --> 01:10:55,802
Rym: Yeah, I think I'll forgive that because the semicolon was so well placed.

1095
01:10:56,465 --> 01:10:59,756
Scott: My question is something I've been wondering What is your view of the military?

1096
01:11:00,398 --> 01:11:04,130
Scott: and my other question is what is y'all's favorite TV show shows?

1097
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:06,297
Rym: Alright now one I would just like to say.

1098
01:11:06,337 --> 01:11:09,290
Rym: this is a topic we could do a whole episode on our views of the military.

1099
01:11:09,391 --> 01:11:16,703
Rym: In the US military is in general Use of force in the world when it's justified when it isn't a recruitment.

1100
01:11:16,864 --> 01:11:17,866
Rym: everything about the military.

1101
01:11:17,887 --> 01:11:27,076
Scott: yet to summarize as long as there are groups of people in the world who have Military forces of some sort.

1102
01:11:27,678 --> 01:11:37,167
Scott: it is required for other groups even good groups to have their own defensive military forces of some sort if they wish to be secure in their persons.

1103
01:11:37,689 --> 01:11:44,890
Rym: and as Libertarian as I am I very much believe that there are times when force is necessary and/or justified.

1104
01:11:45,612 --> 01:12:04,370
Scott: Yes, I'm not going to talk about you know many specific times when force is and is not justified but I will say this as long as your military is voluntary and as long as it is not political and As long as it is used in a justifiable way It is a good military.

1105
01:12:04,832 --> 01:12:15,910
Rym: now to be more specific because I think you were thinking more along the lines of our views of the US military or the People in it and I will say that I have nothing but the utmost respect for anyone who has joined the military.

1106
01:12:16,091 --> 01:12:21,470
Rym: I see it as a great way for people who don't have other opportunities to better themselves to better themselves.

1107
01:12:22,032 --> 01:12:26,390
Rym: I see it as a career for people who for a great number of reasons are involved in it.

1108
01:12:26,491 --> 01:12:31,644
Rym: I actually know a lot of people are in the Navy and Really we have nothing but respect for you guys.

1109
01:12:31,664 --> 01:12:39,638
Rym: Mm-hmm I very much disagree with how the government of this country is using you guys But that is not your fault.

1110
01:12:39,859 --> 01:12:45,818
Scott: Yep, and what it all comes down to is Because we've had problems with this issue before.

1111
01:12:46,621 --> 01:12:50,968
Scott: if there was a draft tomorrow for the Iraq War We would run away.

1112
01:12:51,431 --> 01:12:54,621
Rym: In fact, we were almost attacked by someone because we stated this fact.

1113
01:12:55,042 --> 01:12:59,949
Scott: if there was a draft tomorrow for World War two We wouldn't need to be drafted because he would sign up.

1114
01:13:00,713 --> 01:13:04,010
Rym: Yep, that really kind of sums up how we feel about the military.

1115
01:13:04,151 --> 01:13:06,420
Rym: I very much believe that there are things worth fighting for.

1116
01:13:06,441 --> 01:13:08,590
Rym: Yep, and I would fight for those things.

1117
01:13:10,051 --> 01:13:22,827
Rym: It pains me that our military which is one of the few militaries in the history of the world That has remained mostly non-political I mean so many countries have a military and then as soon as something happened

1118
01:13:22,867 --> 01:13:23,810
Scott: as a military dictator

1119
01:13:24,103 --> 01:13:37,089
Rym: Yep or the military intervenes in politics and the fact that the military and the people in the military Will follow orders and do what they're told to do Even if they disagree with it is in my eyes just an amazing thing

1120
01:13:37,531 --> 01:13:45,495
Scott: Yep, even though sometimes I say to myself dang if those military people just you know, didn't do the things They knew were wrong.

1121
01:13:45,575 --> 01:14:00,213
Scott: I mean there is a line that a military can cross, you know You violate some Geneva Conventions or anything like that, you know There is a line at which a military shouldn't just do whatever it's told but on the whole as a one single unit military.

1122
01:14:00,314 --> 01:14:08,109
Scott: not you know only doing what the Rest of the government tells it to do as opposed to telling the government what it wants to do.

1123
01:14:08,330 --> 01:14:17,210
Rym: Yes, it's a good thing because I mean theoretically we're a democracy in America Which means that the military only acts if the people feel the need for it to act.

1124
01:14:17,591 --> 01:14:25,806
Rym: So theoretically the military only acts when such action is justified and thus they should always follow orders because you know That is that is what a democracy is.

1125
01:14:27,032 --> 01:14:30,110
Rym: I have my views about the politics surrounding that in current America.

1126
01:14:30,890 --> 01:14:35,390
Rym: But all of that aside I have two examples of what I feel are problem.

1127
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:38,406
Rym: I mean these these are two men are my heroes and I don't even remember their names.

1128
01:14:38,446 --> 01:14:40,278
Scott: on the Canadian guy I'm gonna find the Canadian guy right now.

1129
01:14:40,298 --> 01:14:41,990
Rym: All right, you find that I'll talk about the other guy.

1130
01:14:42,111 --> 01:14:44,186
Rym: I forget his name too, but maybe we'll look that up.

1131
01:14:45,615 --> 01:14:46,630
Rym: I believe it was in Vietnam.

1132
01:14:47,152 --> 01:15:15,222
Rym: there was a group of American soldiers who were about to just massacre a bunch of civilians and There was a man in a gunboat or a gun helicopter and he saw what was about to happen and he ordered his men to train their guns from the helicopter on these American soldiers and Ordered them despite the fact that what he was doing was it was justified under a whole bunch of military Statutes and things but it was also disobeying orders from a superior.

1133
01:15:15,663 --> 01:15:22,385
Rym: He ordered these men to stand down or be fired upon and He saved these people's lives and then he was then ostracized from the military.

1134
01:15:22,666 --> 01:15:23,630
Rym: and there's this whole story.

1135
01:15:23,650 --> 01:15:24,893
Rym: I think we'll do an episode on it someday.

1136
01:15:25,455 --> 01:15:27,059
Rym: That man is a hero as far as I'm concerned.

1137
01:15:27,079 --> 01:15:36,772
Rym: and There's also the case of Rwanda where the UN general who was there Scott's looking up his name Defied the orders of the UN.

1138
01:15:36,792 --> 01:15:53,254
Rym: the UN told him to leave to take his troops and leave Rwanda and leave these people to die and He refused the order and he was threatened and as a result him and his men Sabotage their own equipment so that they would be forced to stay in Rwanda and protect everyone they could.

1139
01:15:54,076 --> 01:15:58,029
Scott: the guy's name is Lieutenant General Romeo Alain.

1140
01:15:58,089 --> 01:15:58,731
Scott: Diado.

1141
01:15:58,751 --> 01:16:00,136
Scott: I think it's French.

1142
01:16:00,196 --> 01:16:01,300
Scott: I can't pronounce that properly.

1143
01:16:01,782 --> 01:16:05,260
Scott: He's actually a Canadian senator now, and he is a living hero.

1144
01:16:06,162 --> 01:16:07,670
Rym: Yes, and I just I don't know.

1145
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:09,600
Rym: I mean we really got on a bunch of tangents with that.

1146
01:16:10,242 --> 01:16:13,134
Rym: Yes, we very much respect the military and what it does we're.

1147
01:16:13,255 --> 01:16:14,600
Rym: I'm very glad that it exists.

1148
01:16:14,661 --> 01:16:16,199
Rym: I'm very glad that it fights for us.

1149
01:16:16,883 --> 01:16:20,280
Rym: I wish it would be used in a more responsible way by the people who have the power to do so.

1150
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:26,600
Scott: Yes, I my ideal military would act only defensively like it would be walking around the streets in the United States.

1151
01:16:26,761 --> 01:16:41,183
Scott: It would be on the coast of the United States And if anyone tried to get in and screw with us Then they would go and into action and they wouldn't be in other countries screwing around Unless there was evil there to root out such as Rwanda Darfur etc.

1152
01:16:41,204 --> 01:16:41,565
Scott: Etc.

1153
01:16:41,705 --> 01:16:41,926
Rym: Yes.

1154
01:16:42,448 --> 01:16:45,640
Rym: I'm very I very much am a proponent of peacekeeping missions.

1155
01:16:46,081 --> 01:16:55,120
Rym: I just wish they would actually be engaged properly as in send enough troops and Actually do what needs to be done to prevent people from fighting so that you can help people.

1156
01:16:55,441 --> 01:17:02,284
Rym: Yep, I mean so many times UN peacekeepers are sent somewhere and they're given such terrible Orders like you were not.

1157
01:17:02,364 --> 01:17:04,470
Rym: are such terrible parameters of conflict?

1158
01:17:04,510 --> 01:17:11,674
Rym: or what's the terms of engagement like yes protect these people But you're not allowed to fire your guns or just it's laughable.

1159
01:17:11,835 --> 01:17:12,055
Scott: Yep.

1160
01:17:12,477 --> 01:17:33,879
Scott: And one last thing I read the Wikipedia about this guy that the hero general from Canada Diarrhea, I think Dallaire I don't know is widely known for having served as a force commander of Una Mir the ill-fated United Nations Peacekeeping force for Rwanda between 93 and 94 and we're trying to stop a war of genocide that was being waged by Hutu extremists against Tutsis and Hutu moderates.

1161
01:17:35,921 --> 01:17:39,734
Scott: Guy single-handedly with a very small force tried to stop a genocide.

1162
01:17:40,075 --> 01:17:41,280
Scott: That's what a military is for

1163
01:17:41,762 --> 01:17:53,454
Rym: Yep, and the fact that being in a military like that puts you in a position P puts people normal normal humans I mean people in the military Aren't any different from us except that a lot of them are younger in fact

1164
01:17:53,575 --> 01:17:54,940
Scott: and trained in the military ways.

1165
01:17:55,182 --> 01:17:57,140
Rym: Yeah, but I mean we could have joined the military.

1166
01:17:57,220 --> 01:18:03,488
Rym: We could have been forced to join the military by economic or whatever situations Yeah, but I mean they're people just like us.

1167
01:18:03,609 --> 01:18:13,657
Rym: and yet you're in a position to do such good Mm-hmm and also such bad Yep, and I just have faith that the military of this country will in the end be used only for good.

1168
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:14,420
Scott: Hopefully.

1169
01:18:15,321 --> 01:18:23,120
Rym: Yeah, hopefully I also have the feeling that if our military was ever used in a such an egregious way I mean the Iraq War is terrible.

1170
01:18:23,201 --> 01:18:30,943
Rym: But if things got bad enough I would not only hope for but expect that members of the military would do the same things that Mr.

1171
01:18:30,963 --> 01:18:33,538
Rym: Rwanda or the person from Vietnam did.

1172
01:18:34,361 --> 01:18:45,276
Rym: Yep, because I really just like say all hell broke loose and the US government tried to deploy the military against US citizens Like say there was chaos in the country anarchy or an armed revolution.

1173
01:18:45,296 --> 01:18:50,800
Rym: I Couldn't imagine or fathom American soldiers firing on American citizens.

1174
01:18:51,302 --> 01:18:55,599
Rym: nope, and I just don't think that could ever happen because I have that much faith in our military.

1175
01:18:55,619 --> 01:19:01,056
Scott: and If they did start firing on us, I don't know whose side I'd be on.

1176
01:19:01,096 --> 01:19:02,220
Scott: it would depend on the revolution.

1177
01:19:03,925 --> 01:19:04,931
Scott: Yeah, so yeah.

1178
01:19:05,596 --> 01:19:09,191
Scott: Yeah, we asked What is y'all's favorite TV show shows?

1179
01:19:09,412 --> 01:19:15,662
Rym: All right, that's a real easy Futurama Family Guy Simpsons Firefly.

1180
01:19:15,883 --> 01:19:19,820
Rym: yes, I don't like Firefly but like we're not gonna talk about anime just TV TV shows.

1181
01:19:20,061 --> 01:19:24,220
Scott: Yep, I think the thing is that people have to know is that we don't watch television.

1182
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:27,409
Rym: However, there are TV shows we like South Park.

1183
01:19:27,549 --> 01:19:30,900
Rym: Yeah, we'll watch them on DVD because I just can't stand the advertising.

1184
01:19:31,121 --> 01:19:32,706
Scott: We have a television in our house.

1185
01:19:33,067 --> 01:19:36,919
Scott: There are video game systems and now a Mac Mini plugged into that television.

1186
01:19:37,722 --> 01:19:41,653
Scott: However, we do not get any channels via broadcast or cable.

1187
01:19:41,693 --> 01:19:44,120
Scott: we do not pay for that and we don't get any channels at all.

1188
01:19:44,201 --> 01:19:45,740
Scott: We don't watch live television.

1189
01:19:46,702 --> 01:19:52,262
Scott: All the television we watch is either downloaded off the internet or DVDs Etc.

1190
01:19:52,965 --> 01:19:54,211
Scott: Oh, we watch f1 races.

1191
01:19:54,773 --> 01:19:56,360
Scott: Yeah, we would watch hockey games.

1192
01:19:56,661 --> 01:19:59,153
Scott: Yeah, and there's that show on ESPN.

1193
01:19:59,173 --> 01:20:03,755
Scott: pardon the interruption that I would watch But now I just get an audio version of it on podcast for free.

1194
01:20:03,816 --> 01:20:04,258
Scott: So I don't.

1195
01:20:04,579 --> 01:20:06,490
Rym: yeah I would watch The Daily Show if I could just for free.

1196
01:20:06,610 --> 01:20:07,475
Scott: I'll watch The Daily Show.

1197
01:20:07,515 --> 01:20:08,460
Scott: Maybe the Colbert Report.

1198
01:20:10,144 --> 01:20:11,479
Rym: You can't be a bear.

1199
01:20:12,701 --> 01:20:13,825
Scott: What else would we watch?

1200
01:20:14,387 --> 01:20:15,491
Scott: That's that's pretty much it.

1201
01:20:15,672 --> 01:20:18,060
Rym: Well, like Battlestar Galactica, I'd probably watching.

1202
01:20:18,140 --> 01:20:21,800
Scott: Yeah, most of what I miss from television is live sports.

1203
01:20:22,561 --> 01:20:23,363
Scott: That's pretty much it.

1204
01:20:23,383 --> 01:20:25,670
Scott: Yeah, and there aren't that many live sports.

1205
01:20:25,730 --> 01:20:26,272
Scott: I would watch.

1206
01:20:26,673 --> 01:20:28,780
Scott: I would much just hockey and racing.

1207
01:20:29,121 --> 01:20:33,256
Rym: I would like to be watching new South Park's because I actually have a lot of respect for Trey Parker.

1208
01:20:33,376 --> 01:20:34,480
Rym: and what's the other guy's name?

1209
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:36,180
Rym: That's stone and I like the show.

1210
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:37,205
Rym: The show has really changed.

1211
01:20:37,225 --> 01:20:41,527
Rym: for anyone who didn't who watched the first few seasons and said oh This is just kids swearing and gave it up.

1212
01:20:41,989 --> 01:20:43,275
Rym: I think it's a very intelligent show.

1213
01:20:43,577 --> 01:20:47,119
Scott: Yep Okay, any more questions?

1214
01:20:47,623 --> 01:20:48,409
Rym: Actually, there's one more.

1215
01:20:48,429 --> 01:20:53,179
Rym: I didn't print it because it came late But it was amethyst home away again who asked why we hate advertising so much.

1216
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:57,111
Rym: Now well proud to be proud to be brief because the episodes been long.

1217
01:20:57,814 --> 01:21:04,754
Rym: very briefly one Advertising itself is okay because people advertise things that you get the word out.

1218
01:21:05,255 --> 01:21:22,800
Rym: The problem I have is that Advertising has become a business model in and of itself whereby people will give out content for free attach ads to it and somehow think that this is a viable economic model and I really don't think that it in any way can continue within the next decade.

1219
01:21:23,601 --> 01:21:23,722
Rym: Mm-hmm.

1220
01:21:23,983 --> 01:21:28,020
Rym: I have a lot of reasons for that that I wouldn't really like to get into in detail here because it would take a while.

1221
01:21:29,305 --> 01:21:35,899
Scott: Yeah really just the main problem I have with advertising is that it's so.

1222
01:21:37,081 --> 01:21:49,460
Scott: Most of it at least is not well intentioned, you know, I mean, there's nothing wrong with saying You know, even though I feel bad even doing what I would consider legitimate advertising, you know saying I have a podcast.

1223
01:21:49,562 --> 01:21:50,336
Scott: Please listen to it.

1224
01:21:50,973 --> 01:22:04,131
Scott: but You know when you go out there and you make you know You word things in a way in which you know that the average person will think you said this but technically you only said That and you're not actually lying.

1225
01:22:04,171 --> 01:22:05,600
Scott: So you can't be caught with false advertising.

1226
01:22:06,521 --> 01:22:19,060
Scott: But really you're lying to get people to spend money on something and instead of letting your product speak for itself It's all about marketing and brand rather than physical goods and services and just the intrusiveness of ads.

1227
01:22:19,180 --> 01:22:25,272
Rym: I mean advertisers do horrible things on the internet and I'll say right now I never ever ever see ads on the internet.

1228
01:22:25,333 --> 01:22:26,317
Rym: I block them all.

1229
01:22:26,699 --> 01:22:39,399
Rym: yeah I've talked to people we've known who believe that what I am doing is theft and I say to them Even if I saw the ad I would at best ignore it and at worst would note the product and vowed never to buy it.

1230
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:42,673
Scott: So in fact, you're getting helped by me blocking your ads.

1231
01:22:42,733 --> 01:22:44,160
Rym: case in point the x10 camera.

1232
01:22:44,542 --> 01:22:45,848
Rym: It's actually a really cool thing.

1233
01:22:45,869 --> 01:22:47,296
Rym: It was there's.

1234
01:22:47,356 --> 01:22:48,140
Scott: it was a cool thing.

1235
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:48,665
Rym: It was a good.

1236
01:22:48,786 --> 01:22:53,560
Rym: now logic tech makes webcams But when it came out it was this really cool piece of technology.

1237
01:22:53,961 --> 01:23:05,073
Rym: But their advertising was so ubiquitous and so annoying that I even though I wanted one chose not to buy one Specifically because I dislike their advertising practices on the streets of New York.

1238
01:23:05,113 --> 01:23:05,916
Scott: There are those people.

1239
01:23:06,016 --> 01:23:07,220
Scott: you'll see them every single day.

1240
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:14,324
Scott: they hand out little pieces of paper with menus or come eat at this place or come see this show or Anything like that.

1241
01:23:14,907 --> 01:23:22,456
Scott: if someone's handing out a piece of paper, not only do I not take it But I look and note what the piece of paper is for and I never go there.

1242
01:23:22,636 --> 01:23:27,659
Scott: wherever they're advertising I don't go because I disprove disapprove of their advertising method.

1243
01:23:29,081 --> 01:23:30,448
Rym: Alright, I think that about wraps it up.

1244
01:23:30,468 --> 01:23:33,566
Scott: Alright, there's actually a couple questions that just spots on the forums I want to answer.

1245
01:23:33,647 --> 01:23:34,596
Rym: Alright, let's be quick about it.

1246
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:37,968
Scott: Eson Lindsey says when are you going to do shows?

1247
01:23:38,008 --> 01:23:48,220
Scott: and all the things you said you'll do a show on when we remember What we said, yeah, so if you guys remember what we said, please remind us and we'll do a show on it.

1248
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:50,226
Scott: Well, maybe we should make a remind us thread.

1249
01:23:50,346 --> 01:23:53,236
Scott: and one last question, which I think actually be interesting.

1250
01:23:53,296 --> 01:23:53,698
Scott: amethyst.

1251
01:23:53,818 --> 01:23:58,553
Scott: Oh my ass Which part of your body do you value the most now?

1252
01:23:59,094 --> 01:24:00,238
Rym: I know what Scott's gonna say.

1253
01:24:00,259 --> 01:24:03,511
Rym: No No, I know you're going to say it but then you'll say haha just kidding.

1254
01:24:03,531 --> 01:24:05,399
Rym: But seriously, no now now not.

1255
01:24:06,081 --> 01:24:06,562
Rym: Oh, okay.

1256
01:24:07,064 --> 01:24:08,668
Rym: You were gonna say the penis.

1257
01:24:09,270 --> 01:24:09,430
Scott: Yeah.

1258
01:24:09,450 --> 01:24:11,034
Scott: Well, that's the obvious funny answer.

1259
01:24:11,094 --> 01:24:12,037
Scott: So the penis.

1260
01:24:12,518 --> 01:24:16,022
Rym: Alright anyway It's Hard to say.

1261
01:24:16,042 --> 01:24:19,413
Rym: I mean, I don't want to say my brain because I don't know if my brain matters or not.

1262
01:24:20,175 --> 01:24:25,020
Rym: Um, I I'd want to say my legs because they get me around once in my eyes like spirit.

1263
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:25,843
Rym: I I can't.

1264
01:24:25,883 --> 01:24:28,774
Rym: there's no part of my body that I dislike except my appendix.

1265
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:33,854
Scott: I Don't like says which part of your which one part do you value the most?

1266
01:24:33,955 --> 01:24:35,180
Scott: not which one do you dislike?

1267
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:36,207
Rym: Yeah, but I can't.

1268
01:24:36,308 --> 01:24:37,300
Rym: I value them all equally.

1269
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:40,375
Rym: I mean if I lost my sense of smell I would be devastated.

1270
01:24:40,455 --> 01:24:42,703
Rym: if I lost my sense of sight Equally devastated.

1271
01:24:43,224 --> 01:24:49,620
Scott: see that's the thing is I don't think that if I lost smell and sight they would be equally devastating devastating both.

1272
01:24:50,461 --> 01:25:02,536
Scott: But there are two parts of my body that I think are tied for first place where if I lost those it would be worse Than losing any other single part of my body and those are my eyes and my hands.

1273
01:25:03,138 --> 01:25:10,000
Rym: I honestly Even though it would be a greater inconvenience to my life and it would ruin much of what I want to do with my life.

1274
01:25:10,782 --> 01:25:19,768
Rym: I would I think I would rather lose my sight than my hearing because I love music so much that I Probably couldn't continue living without music yet.

1275
01:25:19,888 --> 01:25:29,779
Scott: I could continue living without hearing is like one like Tiny tiny fraction of a millimeter below seeing and hands on the scale.

1276
01:25:30,241 --> 01:25:34,940
Scott: But I mean, you know, of course brain because without the brain I couldn't do anything at all.

1277
01:25:35,101 --> 01:25:37,040
Scott: But that's you know, that's not the point of the question.

1278
01:25:37,461 --> 01:25:40,669
Rym: Actually, I would I don't want to say my penis but in general

1279
01:25:41,030 --> 01:25:42,213
Scott: the the penis ranks

1280
01:25:42,253 --> 01:25:56,554
Rym: highly it does but the the the ability the erogenous zones of my body in general that I I'm generally a very odd, I guess I feel weird using words like this, especially on a show like this, but a Sensuous kind of sexual person.

1281
01:25:56,695 --> 01:25:59,949
Rym: I'm very Yeah, I think there's no delicate way to put it.

1282
01:26:00,069 --> 01:26:01,574
Rym: I am a Randy dude.

1283
01:26:01,835 --> 01:26:13,340
Scott: Yeah, I think discounting the brain I think the ranking is hands and eyes Then ears, you know mouth tongue the whole head area and then you know the arms and the legs.

1284
01:26:13,521 --> 01:26:16,371
Scott: I guess if you count hands don't need to put the arms with them.

1285
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:21,304
Rym: I know cuz they could just graph the hand on the Shoulder.

1286
01:26:21,345 --> 01:26:23,139
Rym: I guess it's bones knees and bone knees into.

1287
01:26:23,179 --> 01:26:30,198
Scott: yeah Because I mean that's really as a human being the opposing thumbs and the fingers that are.

1288
01:26:30,319 --> 01:26:30,600
Scott: you know?

1289
01:26:31,365 --> 01:26:31,977
Scott: What's the word?

1290
01:26:33,921 --> 01:26:34,262
Rym: I don't know.

1291
01:26:34,303 --> 01:26:34,664
Rym: I'm done.

1292
01:26:34,684 --> 01:26:37,675
Rym: Yeah, I don't have anything more to say without hands.

1293
01:26:37,895 --> 01:26:43,416
Scott: I really can't do anything I can't make things I can't interact with things in an efficient manner.

1294
01:26:43,436 --> 01:26:49,068
Scott: you get a hook hand Yeah, but while a hook is cool I do not discount the quality of a hook.

1295
01:26:49,108 --> 01:26:55,090
Scott: like if I lost one hand and got a hook I might be okay with that But losing both hands, uh-uh.

1296
01:26:55,432 --> 01:26:56,678
Scott: No good two hooks doesn't cut it.

1297
01:26:57,803 --> 01:27:01,840
Scott: And you know if I lost one eye maybe but two eyes not a chance.

1298
01:27:02,664 --> 01:27:03,938
Scott: So there you go hands and eyes.

1299
01:27:05,362 --> 01:27:11,065
Rym: All right, we've now answered all the questions except for Kremlin's inside joke questions.

1300
01:27:11,306 --> 01:27:14,155
Scott: well he can take those inside joke questions and cram them up.

1301
01:27:14,215 --> 01:27:18,913
Rym: his inside joke though I will say he did remind me of a story that I totally forgotten about.
