00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,137
Rym: It's Monday September 11th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:12,399 --> 00:00:17,720
Rym: tonight We begin origins week bringing you the origin stories of the fabled geekly interests of Rym and Scott's.

3
00:00:19,502 --> 00:00:20,538
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:21,442 --> 00:00:25,894
Scott: So today work was crazy and usually work is nothing really.

5
00:00:26,134 --> 00:00:26,957
Rym: so did you do work?

6
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:33,055
Scott: No well I guess I did do things with my body to help the company in a way.

7
00:00:33,516 --> 00:00:34,640
Rym: What did you move furniture around?

8
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:40,859
Scott: No, but I basically I get to work and my plan today at work was to go in play DDR.

9
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:42,728
Scott: at work I had my DDR pad in the trunk.

10
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,820
Rym: Yeah, you had this crazy idea the hatch the hatch.

11
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:47,740
Rym: Yeah, bring in the DDR pad to work, which would be brilliant.

12
00:00:48,021 --> 00:00:50,429
Scott: It would have been brilliant except today of all days.

13
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,155
Scott: There was people at my work.

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,162
Scott: Oh My god.

15
00:00:54,303 --> 00:01:12,000
Scott: what they were doing is they were taking the furniture out of the office and they're sending it somewhere God knows where and they're gonna get new furniture and hopefully after they get new furniture they'll get new people besides just me, but Today I had to clear off computers from a bunch of desks so that they could take the furniture away.

16
00:01:12,602 --> 00:01:14,749
Rym: So you didn't bring the DDR pad.

17
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:16,515
Scott: I didn't bring DDR petting cuz there's people there.

18
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:17,178
Scott: They would have seen it.

19
00:01:17,318 --> 00:01:21,357
Rym: so So you've done other things with your body before.

20
00:01:21,377 --> 00:01:26,040
Scott: yeah Yeah, but people weren't there seeing it anyway.

21
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,422
Rym: How do you know?

22
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:30,240
Rym: how do you know there isn't some security camera that is in the ceiling that you don't know about?

23
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,706
Scott: How do you know?

24
00:01:31,726 --> 00:01:35,200
Scott: I know you can make real tiny cameras I'm 100% sure anyway.

25
00:01:35,623 --> 00:01:38,925
Scott: Then I had to go to my parents house to fix their computer Which is mad broken.

26
00:01:39,227 --> 00:01:43,366
Scott: and let me tell you this computer is crazy broken Crazy broken like.

27
00:01:43,627 --> 00:01:45,394
Scott: you'll turn it on and it'll work.

28
00:01:45,876 --> 00:01:49,148
Scott: then you'll turn it on again And you'll get a kernel panic right away about the.

29
00:01:49,228 --> 00:02:01,004
Scott: it'll say like the kernel tar ball is in an improper compressed format you'll reboot it again and it'll start uncompressing the kernel and then give a different kernel panic about not being able to Mount the VFS.

30
00:02:01,085 --> 00:02:07,670
Rym: know it seems like many of the computer the computers you have given to your parents have always had problems And you keep having to do things to them.

31
00:02:08,132 --> 00:02:09,759
Scott: Yeah, and then check this out.

32
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:16,506
Scott: So I try to boot in Ubuntu CD on the thing and it starts to boot the CD and then gives a kernel panic from a CD.

33
00:02:17,091 --> 00:02:23,639
Scott: from a CD I Think the last computer they had the IDE controller broke and the one they have now.

34
00:02:24,243 --> 00:02:27,180
Scott: I'm pretty sure the IDE controller broke now.

35
00:02:27,341 --> 00:02:32,489
Scott: So I'm thinking that they they have some sort of power Problems and I'm gonna buy them a UPS.

36
00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:35,320
Scott: when I cuz I ordered them a new motherboard CPU and RAM.

37
00:02:35,783 --> 00:02:52,652
Scott: By the way, the motherboard and CPU RAM I got them was a 1.6 gigahertz sempron with 512 megabytes of RAM with a motherboard that has a built-in g4 6100 micro ATX 64 bits processor for a hundred and seventy four dollars.

38
00:02:52,713 --> 00:03:03,760
Scott: that's faster than either of our computer Faster than any computer that any of my friends own period hands down and it was $174 for the motherboard CPU RAM video card sound card network card.

39
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,005
Scott: So all rolled into one.

40
00:03:05,105 --> 00:03:06,089
Rym: so who was in the forums?

41
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:08,820
Rym: who thought that building a thousand dollar computer was a good idea?

42
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,191
Scott: I don't know, but they were dumbass.

43
00:03:10,292 --> 00:03:11,863
Scott: I Mean this thing.

44
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:16,124
Scott: granted this thing has an onboard video card and it's not.

45
00:03:16,144 --> 00:03:24,410
Scott: it's a 6100 and the one in my computer is a 5900 and You're not gonna play half-life 2 at Really good speeds.

46
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,000
Scott: I mean, it'll be barely playable.

47
00:03:26,563 --> 00:03:34,457
Scott: However, you can just for a few hundred bucks slap You know a newer GeForce in the PCI Express slot and you are good to go.

48
00:03:34,557 --> 00:03:41,680
Rym: You could spend $500 on a video card and still be cheaper than that thousand dollar computer.

49
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:49,997
Scott: Yeah, not only that but you know the sempron not the fastest processor But 1.6 gigahertz 64-bit processor is enough for anything you're gonna do.

50
00:03:50,178 --> 00:03:50,560
Scott: Oh my god.

51
00:03:51,382 --> 00:03:54,740
Scott: And I only got 512 megs of RAM, but to double that add 50 bucks.

52
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:57,410
Scott: So 250 plus a video card and you're set.

53
00:03:58,073 --> 00:03:59,900
Rym: Anyway, the UPS is probably a good idea.

54
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,964
Rym: I mean we UPS.

55
00:04:00,984 --> 00:04:08,048
Scott: if I had our entire house, I'm beginning to think that's the problem because they had this really Strange old ghetto power strip.

56
00:04:08,088 --> 00:04:09,172
Scott: That was mad shady.

57
00:04:09,312 --> 00:04:10,457
Rym: Why did you let them use that?

58
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:11,380
Scott: I don't know.

59
00:04:11,642 --> 00:04:13,719
Scott: I I didn't really have much say in that matter.

60
00:04:14,001 --> 00:04:19,750
Scott: You pretty much just brought a computer to their house and it was plugged in and you didn't look at what it was plugged into In those days.

61
00:04:19,812 --> 00:04:20,740
Scott: I didn't pay much attention.

62
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:23,770
Scott: So I'm gonna replace their motherboard CPU and RAM.

63
00:04:24,272 --> 00:04:26,500
Scott: see what I can do with the old motherboard CPU and RAM.

64
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:33,340
Scott: I mean, I bought this computer for them back in the day for $400 and They never gave me the $400.

65
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,528
Rym: So it's you know what they did.

66
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:39,040
Rym: help you, you know, go to school and pay for that's all your upper side.

67
00:04:39,101 --> 00:04:39,816
Scott: Do you want here?

68
00:04:40,804 --> 00:04:41,554
Scott: That's what they say.

69
00:04:41,675 --> 00:04:50,420
Scott: Anyway the point is Is that I'm gonna fix this computer up and computers are wicked cheap and also this computer is strangely broken.

70
00:04:52,742 --> 00:04:53,505
Rym: Better call Randy.

71
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:54,369
Rym: there's a ghost in there.

72
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,197
Scott: I know it's a non-deterministic computer.

73
00:04:56,217 --> 00:04:56,880
Scott: What's the world coming?

74
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,646
Rym: We better get a skepticality on it.

75
00:04:58,807 --> 00:05:00,091
Scott: I know it's craziness.

76
00:05:00,794 --> 00:05:01,015
Rym: All right.

77
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:13,360
Rym: So anyway in the actual news Wikipedia now there's been a lot lately about how Google and Yahoo and Microsoft have been kowtowing in various ways to the oppressive regime in China.

78
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:21,685
Scott: Yeah, it seems like your choices are kowtow, which is look down upon but then you can do business in China Where there's a billion people to pay you.

79
00:05:21,705 --> 00:05:27,340
Scott: Yeah, or you cannot kowtow, which is good, but then a billion people in China.

80
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:33,580
Scott: It's like, you know, it's like what's better not to influence those people at all or to influence them in a censored way.

81
00:05:34,405 --> 00:05:41,100
Rym: Now kind of like the way I always like to break up the way France Britain Spain and Portugal treated natives they ran across.

82
00:05:41,964 --> 00:05:43,129
Rym: It seems like the companies here.

83
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:44,334
Rym: you can break it down the same way.

84
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:53,770
Rym: at the bottom end You have Yahoo who pretty much just openly collaborate Helping the Chinese find dissidents that they can then torture and kill or whatever they do to them.

85
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:01,249
Rym: then you have Google who allows the censorship and does all the censoring China wants.

86
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:09,249
Rym: but on Any time something is censored Google says hey we censored something and they only censor the Chinese one.

87
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,085
Rym: Then there is Wikipedia.

88
00:06:12,145 --> 00:06:12,910
Rym: That is the news today.

89
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:21,612
Rym: Wikipedia has given China the big double-deuce and said we're not going to censor shit anybody and You can take that.

90
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:25,780
Rym: however, you want China responded by banning Wikipedia from China.

91
00:06:27,162 --> 00:06:38,520
Scott: See here's the problem is that if there's no Chinese people on Wikipedia The Chinese Wikipedia won't be edited very much and therefore won't have much information to be censored and no one will see it.

92
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,780
Scott: So it basically makes they might as well not have the Chinese Wikipedia if they're not going to censor.

93
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,827
Rym: Well, I think they block normal Wikipedia, too Because there there's now.

94
00:06:47,847 --> 00:06:58,880
Rym: the one thing I found interesting a lot of people slash dot pointed this out was Why doesn't China let Wikipedia do whatever it wants and just edit Wikipedia to talk about how great communism is.

95
00:06:59,861 --> 00:07:00,550
Rym: There are more people.

96
00:07:02,283 --> 00:07:05,515
Rym: The Chinese government can hire more people to edit it the way they want it.

97
00:07:05,715 --> 00:07:08,505
Rym: then Wikipedia could have Preventing it from being edited.

98
00:07:08,725 --> 00:07:12,016
Scott: But Wikipedia can do is prevent it from being edited by China.

99
00:07:12,257 --> 00:07:15,640
Rym: Yeah long term There are no long term protections in Wikipedia.

100
00:07:15,781 --> 00:07:24,460
Rym: There are short-term protections for things like abuse Like if a million people suddenly decide to change an article about something stupid like to try to add bananas to an article.

101
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:29,760
Scott: Well doesn't every IP address in China begin with you know, some range of numbers that they can just block Tor?

102
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,011
Rym: Yeah, there are many ways around that.

103
00:07:32,232 --> 00:07:33,539
Scott: Do you think see this is the thing?

104
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,980
Scott: Governments like China don't seem to understand that Tor exists and that their citizens are using it.

105
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,153
Scott: How are they gonna know to use it for their advantage?

106
00:07:41,556 --> 00:07:41,978
Rym: Of course?

107
00:07:43,821 --> 00:07:45,709
Rym: Germany recently has been attacking Tor.

108
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:46,613
Scott: Oh, yeah, they.

109
00:07:46,794 --> 00:07:48,140
Scott: they took a bunch of Tor servers.

110
00:07:48,461 --> 00:07:53,160
Rym: Yeah on the auspicious grounds that child pornography might be involved in some way.

111
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:59,220
Scott: Therefore we're taking all these people's computers, even though these computers Don't actually have child pornography on them.

112
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:11,800
Rym: Not only that but if their argument were we're going to seize these computers look at the logs and track down the child porn I would while I would disagree with parts of that on fundamental, you know freedom issues at least it would make sense.

113
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,019
Rym: Good, but here's the thing There are no logs.

114
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:23,320
Rym: Seizing those computers can do nothing because there's absolutely no way from seizing one computer to find out who connected to that Tor server.

115
00:08:23,422 --> 00:08:24,298
Rym: That's how Tor works.

116
00:08:24,941 --> 00:08:34,595
Scott: yeah, the thing is you know would be cool is if I had some sort of Tor server and there was a way to tell From the logs who was a child pornographer or whatever.

117
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:35,259
Rym: Oh, I'd turn him in.

118
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,234
Scott: Yeah, I would have no problem just like setting up.

119
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,480
Scott: Here's an anonymous thing.

120
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:44,780
Scott: You can everyone can be anonymous on the internet, but I'll know if you're doing child porn.

121
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,032
Scott: That's the only thing that will show up is if you're a child pornographer then you're in.

122
00:08:48,072 --> 00:08:50,140
Scott: your anonymity will be you know destroyed.

123
00:08:50,483 --> 00:08:52,499
Scott: That way child pornographers wouldn't be able to use it.

124
00:08:52,640 --> 00:09:01,376
Rym: The problem here is just the collateral damage because it seems like whenever Governments try to tackle this problem of child porn and while I it is definitely a problem.

125
00:09:02,018 --> 00:09:02,880
Rym: It's a very bad thing.

126
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:12,139
Rym: I don't I wonder how wide spread of a problem It is that the collateral damage of all these measures governments take to prevent it are worth it.

127
00:09:12,441 --> 00:09:21,680
Scott: Well, here's what bothers me right is that they're like doing all these things You know to stop child porn and taking things down that are mostly used for non child porn.

128
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,371
Scott: I mean, I'm sure there's a torrent somewhere of a child porn.

129
00:09:24,611 --> 00:09:26,760
Scott: there has to be just because the internet exists.

130
00:09:27,342 --> 00:09:32,379
Scott: But take you know attacking bit torrent because someone made a bit torrent of a child porn is not good.

131
00:09:33,143 --> 00:09:44,580
Scott: But if you go on IRC, you know in certain IRC networks When I used to go on IRC to go to like, you know I would go to some room about a video game to get a help or I'd go to some room about Linux to ask.

132
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,780
Rym: So I used IRC for any reason other than finding illegal.

133
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:51,913
Scott: That's the only reason I used IRC and you would go in there and like.

134
00:09:51,953 --> 00:09:56,467
Scott: the top 100 rooms would all be Child porn kitty xxx.

135
00:09:56,788 --> 00:09:58,072
Rym: Well, you know what the secret there is.

136
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:00,900
Rym: every one of those rooms are full of nothing but FBI agents.

137
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:02,218
Scott: It could be.

138
00:10:03,542 --> 00:10:10,211
Scott: But the point is even if those rooms aren't just full of FBI agents Why don't they just it's so there's so many obvious.

139
00:10:10,371 --> 00:10:11,536
Scott: there's a you know, hi.

140
00:10:11,676 --> 00:10:12,740
Scott: I'm a child pornographer.

141
00:10:13,124 --> 00:10:16,880
Scott: I'm a. I look at child porn guys And they caught that kid.

142
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:22,340
Scott: Yeah, there was some kid who is on my floor and he was stupid and he didn't know how to secure his computer.

143
00:10:22,683 --> 00:10:32,080
Scott: So he accidentally was sharing One, you know a folder on his machine on you know Local network area and it had child porn in it and they busted him.

144
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:35,600
Rym: Yeah, because the way RIT works the network is pretty much the Wild West.

145
00:10:36,343 --> 00:10:50,720
Rym: So if your computer is in any way compromised and you go to RIT Everyone else in the school other than maybe the frat boys Will be in your computer rooting around looking for whatever fun stuff and usually be printed a goat siata some random shared printer.

146
00:10:50,841 --> 00:10:51,608
Rym: Yes, we did.

147
00:10:51,629 --> 00:11:14,430
Rym: Yeah Anyway, yeah, he was reported to the police like a hundred times by from all the people who found that Mmm, but anyway in the whole Wikipedia thing Jimmy Wales, you know the Wikipedia guy His quote was quote we occupy a position in the culture that I wish Google would take up Which is that we stand for the freedom of information

148
00:11:16,082 --> 00:11:16,223
Scott: Mm-hmm.

149
00:11:16,866 --> 00:11:26,067
Rym: And now the one thing I would say is I mean everyone says oh, this is great Wikipedia is standing up against China and Wikipedia is the only service that has the balls to tell China They're not going to censor.

150
00:11:26,127 --> 00:11:33,517
Rym: but at the same time I think Google's policy is also equally valid because they're basic something they basically go after.

151
00:11:33,557 --> 00:11:34,560
Rym: is that alright?

152
00:11:35,202 --> 00:11:50,559
Rym: the choice is either no one in China has any access to Google at all and they lose all that information or they will get access to everything we can give them access to and We will tell them straight up that the government is censoring everything else.

153
00:11:51,641 --> 00:11:57,240
Rym: Yeah, that's pretty much, you know, the other difference is that Google and Yahoo have a financial interest.

154
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,469
Rym: Wikipedia has no financial interest.

155
00:11:59,489 --> 00:12:04,953
Rym: So there is almost zero pressure on Wikipedia to deal with China or not deal with China.

156
00:12:04,973 --> 00:12:05,656
Rym: they could care less.

157
00:12:05,676 --> 00:12:06,540
Rym: it wouldn't affect them at all.

158
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:11,860
Rym: Mm-hmm, if Google doesn't deal in China that is going to be a serious long-term economic consequence.

159
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,940
Scott: So really neat is someone like Microsoft to not deal in China?

160
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:20,760
Scott: Yeah, this is actually one of the failings of open-source software is that you can just you use it in.

161
00:12:21,061 --> 00:12:26,680
Rym: You know remember you could have GPL but then have a clause in there that says accept the Chinese government.

162
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,840
Scott: I think that's something actually that they're talking about for GPL 3 if I recall correctly is there you know.

163
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,769
Scott: They're saying you can't use this if you're a horrible repressive government.

164
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:37,999
Rym: There's also an anti-military clause that's been propping up now and again.

165
00:12:38,948 --> 00:12:39,778
Scott: I don't know about that.

166
00:12:40,701 --> 00:12:41,042
Scott: Shouldn't be?

167
00:12:41,082 --> 00:12:44,960
Scott: you, you know, cuz you know, you could use Linux on like soldiers laptops.

168
00:12:45,022 --> 00:12:45,125
Scott: Yeah.

169
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,045
Rym: But what if?

170
00:12:46,086 --> 00:12:51,380
Rym: what if someone who made an Application decided that they didn't want soldiers to use it or they didn't want militaries to use it.

171
00:12:51,581 --> 00:12:53,247
Scott: They can add that to their own license.

172
00:12:53,328 --> 00:12:53,609
Rym: Oh, yeah.

173
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:55,999
Rym: No, it's they use the GPL plus this add-on.

174
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:56,942
Rym: Yeah, it's like.

175
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:59,331
Rym: it's like a mod to the GPL a plug-in.

176
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:01,839
Scott: Yeah, it's just kind of like I don't know.

177
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:09,269
Scott: Well, I agree with the you, you know, if your government partakes in genocide You can't use my software to aid your genocide.

178
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:19,200
Scott: that way you don't end up being IBM where everyone's like Oh IBM help Nazis but at the same time You know if some legitimate army wants to use your software, what's the difference?

179
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:27,320
Rym: I mean the question is do you when you create something that is if I'm you know Just bits you create some data or a program you arrange some bits?

180
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,909
Rym: What are the rights you have regarding how it is used?

181
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,799
Rym: because the GPL basically says that I?

182
00:13:33,802 --> 00:13:39,000
Rym: Like other people to use my stuff, but I reserve all these rights and I can fuck you if you violate.

183
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,073
Scott: Well, it's mostly if I default.

184
00:13:41,234 --> 00:13:42,140
Scott: all rights are reserved.

185
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,653
Scott: So you're saying I am NOT reserving a whole mess of rights and only reserving so.

186
00:13:45,673 --> 00:13:49,598
Rym: that means I have the right to restrict anything I make in any way I want.

187
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:58,414
Rym: so I could just say no one named Bob no women and No people with one eye are allowed to use my media player.

188
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,178
Scott: go for it.

189
00:13:59,218 --> 00:13:59,700
Scott: That'd be awesome.

190
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,508
Scott: Oh That'd be so cool.

191
00:14:02,688 --> 00:14:03,934
Scott: We should make software like that.

192
00:14:04,296 --> 00:14:09,273
Scott: so yet again They have released the list of the top 50 most expensive ad words.

193
00:14:09,413 --> 00:14:14,650
Rym: now if you don't know how Google AdWords works Mesothelioma is worth a lot of money and nothing else matters.

194
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,900
Scott: well mesothelioma was worth a lot of money.

195
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,520
Scott: Oh really the way it works is let's say you want to put an advertisement on Google in the Google Ads.

196
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:30,740
Scott: You have to pay money for every click, so let's say I want To get a hundred visitors to my website.

197
00:14:31,524 --> 00:14:37,360
Scott: I have to pay a hundred times the amount of money Depending on what words I want.

198
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:44,391
Scott: So let's say I have a video game website and the video game the word video game costs five bucks And I want a hundred visitors.

199
00:14:44,411 --> 00:14:45,619
Scott: I have to pay five hundred bucks.

200
00:14:46,363 --> 00:14:52,908
Scott: Then Google will put my ad up and keep putting it up Until there are five hundred clicks on it.

201
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,612
Rym: now there are numerous problems with this.

202
00:14:54,693 --> 00:15:07,340
Rym: mainly one thing and actually I've done this before A lot of people had little movements where say you don't like chiropractors Google for chiropractor or back pain and every time you see a chiropractor's ad word click on it.

203
00:15:07,762 --> 00:15:11,117
Rym: It took almost no effort from you, and you just cost them a reasonable amount of money.

204
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:15,373
Scott: yep And if you know sometimes the ad words are on Google.

205
00:15:15,634 --> 00:15:17,340
Scott: Google likes that because Google makes money.

206
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,596
Scott: But if the ad were if the advertisements appear on some other websites like you'll go to some.

207
00:15:21,677 --> 00:15:25,027
Scott: you know your friends Webcomic and it has Google ads on it.

208
00:15:25,648 --> 00:15:33,714
Scott: if you click on that not only you know not only does that subtract one click from The person advertising, but it gives the person with the website money.

209
00:15:34,136 --> 00:15:34,778
Scott: You know so.

210
00:15:34,859 --> 00:15:39,200
Scott: anyway This is a list of the 50 most expensive ad words.

211
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:44,164
Scott: So if you're an advertiser and you want to advertise You know specific words.

212
00:15:44,606 --> 00:15:45,930
Scott: some cost more than others.

213
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:50,223
Scott: very popular words cost a lot and very unpopular words Don't cost so much.

214
00:15:50,846 --> 00:15:52,593
Rym: so what words are currently winning?

215
00:15:53,175 --> 00:16:01,766
Scott: the currently most expensive in terms of average cost per click ad word is school loan consolidation.

216
00:16:02,007 --> 00:16:13,520
Rym: now that makes a lot of sense because interest rates are going up and A lot of people who don't know a lot about how loans work Really think that consolidating their student loans is a good idea in case the interest rates go higher.

217
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:18,420
Scott: Yep, and there's a lot of spam going on about school loan consolidation.

218
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:29,430
Rym: God you wouldn't believe how much how many letters we get in the mail that look legitimate like they act like they're from the federal Government, but they're actually just student student loan consolidation.

219
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,353
Rym: bullshit scams.

220
00:16:30,553 --> 00:16:32,820
Scott: Yeah, I mean God what?

221
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,167
Scott: It's basically it when you think about it.

222
00:16:36,388 --> 00:16:44,805
Scott: It's a sort of a good system and sort of a bad system in that one horrible spammers are able to advertise and That's not so good.

223
00:16:44,845 --> 00:16:48,218
Scott: I mean, I'll be much happier if they just got they can advertise anyway.

224
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:57,131
Scott: freedom of speech I know I know but it's like if I was running an ad system and someone came to me to buy ads and they said Yeah, I want to run this, you know scam ad.

225
00:16:57,171 --> 00:16:59,079
Scott: I would say no you can't run the scam ad.

226
00:16:59,581 --> 00:17:05,500
Scott: However, it is sort of a self filtering system because if a scam gets popular it gets very expensive.

227
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:15,760
Scott: I mean if you want to run an ad about school loan consolidation You have to pay sixty nine dollars and sixteen cents on average for one click.

228
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:21,162
Scott: That means if you want to scam a hundred people you have to pay at least Sixty nine.

229
00:17:21,202 --> 00:17:26,518
Rym: not only that I can cost you sixty nine dollars just by clicking on something in my web browser.

230
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:28,865
Scott: Yep So it does.

231
00:17:28,986 --> 00:17:35,160
Scott: it is sort of a self-fixing system and it's well the thing someone ends up paying a ton of money is basically dying anyway.

232
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:41,625
Rym: Google is looking for a way to get away from this system entirely because they keep getting sued about false clicks Like the ones I was talking about.

233
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:41,926
Rym: Yeah,

234
00:17:42,107 --> 00:17:57,634
Scott: click fraud is a huge problem and a topic for another day but the point is is that the Google ad system is where most of Google's money comes from and that's why they're so powerful and huge and This is a pretty good insight into how the system works.

235
00:17:57,734 --> 00:17:58,518
Scott: If you don't understand

236
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:18,139
Rym: not only that It's a good insight into what's going on in the world because before Mesothelioma was the number one thing because there were a lot of lawyers who were basically scamming old people who may or may not have had this cancer that is caused partially by exposure to asbestos and Getting them to try to sue the people who may have exposed them to it.

237
00:18:18,643 --> 00:18:27,260
Rym: And while the lawsuits would often be lost The lawyer would get a bunch of money from the old person and if the lawsuit won The lawyer got a whole bunch of money from the old person and from the company.

238
00:18:27,722 --> 00:18:30,600
Rym: It was win-win unless you're the old person with mesothelioma.

239
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:39,314
Scott: Yeah, if you just look at the list of the most expensive ad words, it's basically hey I wonder what the most popular scams are going on.

240
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:40,640
Scott: Oh, there they are.

241
00:18:47,723 --> 00:18:49,624
Rym: Anyway things of the day Who?

242
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:50,799
Scott: I got a good one.

243
00:18:51,103 --> 00:18:59,738
Rym: I had a good one But because of very the fact that my computer is old and busted and it's steady state meaning I'm not upgrading anything on it until I buy a new one.

244
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:03,760
Rym: Also the fact that the flash players in Linux don't work so well.

245
00:19:04,762 --> 00:19:08,059
Rym: Firefox crashed and I couldn't find this thing again.

246
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:09,724
Scott: So what are you gonna do?

247
00:19:10,105 --> 00:19:14,617
Rym: Well, I might set myself on fire and jump off of - Tereth.

248
00:19:14,638 --> 00:19:24,780
Rym: Yeah See now because my the thing of the day which was a fat scary guy who made a video Yelling at people on 4chan for messing with him on the internets.

249
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,008
Rym: Which was you got?

250
00:19:27,852 --> 00:19:29,239
Rym: this guy got old?

251
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:40,240
Rym: Okay, anyway, mm-hmm, I have to go with an old classic that I can't believe we haven't talked about on the show.

252
00:19:40,361 --> 00:19:43,124
Rym: I'm sure I've referenced it Many times.

253
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:46,940
Rym: you've probably heard me say something and you wondered what the hell I was talking about.

254
00:19:47,141 --> 00:19:47,923
Rym: There's a good chance.

255
00:19:48,004 --> 00:19:51,415
Rym: I was talking about Lord of the Rings on the go.

256
00:19:51,435 --> 00:19:59,386
Rym: Oh Yeah, now this is something that has brought belly laughs from Hundreds of people.

257
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,217
Rym: I'm in and around the front row crew for many years.

258
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,245
Scott: Then a third.

259
00:20:04,506 --> 00:20:08,500
Rym: it has brought so many inside jokes into our lives to this day.

260
00:20:08,882 --> 00:20:14,386
Rym: If I look at Lord of the Rings on the go within two pages of it I will be laughing out loud.

261
00:20:14,486 --> 00:20:15,550
Rym: Even if I try not to.

262
00:20:16,273 --> 00:20:18,019
Scott: so what is Lord of the Rings on the go?

263
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,086
Rym: Well, I'm glad you asked.

264
00:20:20,407 --> 00:20:35,429
Rym: Lord of the Rings on the go was a. it wasn't a Photoshop Friday But it was a comedy goldmine on something awful years ago like pretty much right after the third Lord of the Rings movie came out the Return of the King and What it was is that was years ago.

265
00:20:35,449 --> 00:20:37,156
Rym: Yeah, we're old.

266
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,059
Scott: Yeah, we are.

267
00:20:38,881 --> 00:20:39,645
Scott: Okay, go on.

268
00:20:40,027 --> 00:20:40,128
Rym: Yeah.

269
00:20:40,148 --> 00:20:44,994
Rym: Well my favorite thing if you want to remember how old you are The nightmare before Christmas came out more than ten years ago.

270
00:20:45,054 --> 00:20:46,180
Scott: Yeah, it sure did.

271
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:51,317
Rym: So this is a basically, you know, something awful has the amazing Photoshop contest.

272
00:20:51,337 --> 00:20:52,140
Rym: They're always hilarious.

273
00:20:52,902 --> 00:21:06,700
Rym: This was like that except instead of making good photoshops you were encouraged to make bad Photoshops not only bad photoshops, but bad photoshops involving cars and the Lord of the Rings.

274
00:21:07,982 --> 00:21:11,135
Rym: Yeah, now the it's hard to explain the humor.

275
00:21:11,175 --> 00:21:12,039
Rym: you just have to look at it.

276
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:21,018
Rym: but imagine like a car and it's crashed into another car and you see a badly photoshopped Aragorn sitting in it.

277
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,169
Rym: and Then underneath you see Pippin yelling.

278
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:28,425
Rym: He was stabbed by a four-door blade Ha ha ha.

279
00:21:28,445 --> 00:21:29,068
Scott: That was a good one.

280
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,153
Rym: Yes, it was.

281
00:21:30,574 --> 00:21:34,351
Rym: and of course the the the Triumphal moment of this entire comedy.

282
00:21:34,371 --> 00:21:35,435
Rym: gold mine though.

283
00:21:35,455 --> 00:21:38,288
Rym: There are hundreds of them Like that's no or corn.

284
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,780
Rym: one does not simply drive into mold or.

285
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,604
Rym: But there's this.

286
00:21:44,825 --> 00:21:47,836
Rym: now you all remember the scene in the Lord of the Rings the Return of the King.

287
00:21:47,856 --> 00:21:48,760
Rym: this is a spoiler.

288
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:54,340
Rym: Denethor sets himself on fire and jumps off of minus Tereth to his death.

289
00:21:54,621 --> 00:22:07,539
Rym: Yep, and despite the fact that it was a very serious scene it ended up being hilarious in the movie partly because Denethor the way The cinematography went he had to run like two minutes to get to that cliff and jump off of it.

290
00:22:08,781 --> 00:22:19,849
Scott: If you had to go all the way from the castle around the tree down the walkway and off the cliff and they showed you just Now the video or the video God the Photoshop.

291
00:22:19,889 --> 00:22:23,000
Rym: here is there is a Pinto as in the car.

292
00:22:23,743 --> 00:22:25,954
Scott: It is, you know, the one that is famous for setting on fire.

293
00:22:26,295 --> 00:22:27,160
Rym: It is on fire.

294
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:35,291
Rym: Denethor is in it as in his face is there in the driver's seat and he's screaming and he is also on fire and it is Flying off of minus Tereth.

295
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:39,792
Rym: Whoa If you want to laugh, it's much funnier if you look at it.

296
00:22:40,053 --> 00:22:41,580
Scott: Yes, and you know that you get the joke.

297
00:22:41,741 --> 00:22:46,553
Scott: It's sort of like if you don't know Lord of the Rings and you don't know cars Even just a little bit.

298
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:50,454
Scott: you need to know cars But you got to know Lord of the Rings and then this will be funny.

299
00:22:50,695 --> 00:22:52,944
Scott: if you don't know Lord of the Rings You're not gonna get any of this.

300
00:22:52,964 --> 00:22:54,007
Scott: you can go why.

301
00:22:54,107 --> 00:23:02,706
Rym: you've also got to know a lot of those funny old internet picture cliches like the guy really like a Yeah, really like there's.

302
00:23:02,726 --> 00:23:06,700
Rym: this guy was a car and he stacked too much stuff on it and the suspension is failing.

303
00:23:07,462 --> 00:23:10,899
Rym: And of course, there's the potato potato joke.

304
00:23:11,544 --> 00:23:13,540
Rym: Mmm, anyway, it is hilarious.

305
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,048
Rym: It is old if you haven't seen it before.

306
00:23:16,148 --> 00:23:18,255
Rym: welcome to the internet if you don't get it.

307
00:23:18,777 --> 00:23:19,639
Rym: Welcome to the internet.

308
00:23:20,582 --> 00:23:23,570
Scott: So my thing of the day here, I'm I like a whole lot.

309
00:23:23,871 --> 00:23:35,039
Rym: It's called Unix the whole hog H-o-l-e H-a-w-g and you'll see why that's well, I guess if you make someone a eunuch, then there's really just a hole there.

310
00:23:36,342 --> 00:23:47,809
Scott: It's it's Unix the whole hog the whole hog of operating systems by Neal Stevenson author of snow crash and diamond age and kryptonomic on and all those good books that everyone who's a geek likes.

311
00:23:47,829 --> 00:23:52,578
Scott: and this is a Short essay that you can read in a few minutes.

312
00:23:53,500 --> 00:24:00,280
Scott: Comparing this particular drill like a drill as in it makes holes in wood and other materials.

313
00:24:00,822 --> 00:24:15,631
Scott: That is made by the Milwaukee tool company called the whole hog And this drill is pretty much the motherfucker of drills I think like he in the in the piece here he tells a story about a guy who was drilling into the side of a house.

314
00:24:16,173 --> 00:24:30,094
Scott: the bit on the drill got stuck and Instead of the you know drill going digga digga digga or stopping or anything like that The drill the guy was still holding on to it spun the guy around holding the drill.

315
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:54,473
Scott: This is a motherfucker of a drill and basically, the whole thing is using this drill as a metaphor for how the Unix operating system is You know and trying to explain to normal people why people who use Unix are the way they are and why Unix is the way it is and I just want to read a short paragraph about it here.

316
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:59,306
Scott: a Smaller tool is dangerous, too but for a completely different reason.

317
00:24:59,587 --> 00:25:05,100
Scott: it tries to do what you tell it to and fails in some way that is Unpredictable and most always undesirable.

318
00:25:05,702 --> 00:25:16,940
Scott: But the whole hog is like the genie of the ancient fairy tales who carries out his master's restrictions literally and precisely and with unlimited power often with disastrous unforeseen consequences.

319
00:25:18,007 --> 00:25:19,799
Scott: And that is what Unix is like.

320
00:25:20,642 --> 00:25:27,338
Scott: So everyone should read this because it's hilarious and especially because now that I know about this drill I kind of want this drill.

321
00:25:28,001 --> 00:25:37,953
Rym: Well, like think about if you're in Unix and you type RM - RF star star and you forget that star dot star Or you you've meant to type something you type something else.

322
00:25:38,255 --> 00:25:38,677
Rym: You're fucked.

323
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:46,787
Rym: It's over Because it does exactly what you wanted it to do with unlimited power no Unforeseen consequence.

324
00:25:46,888 --> 00:25:49,639
Rym: it does what you told it to do not what you wanted it to do.

325
00:25:49,921 --> 00:25:50,282
Scott: I know he's.

326
00:25:50,322 --> 00:25:51,927
Scott: that's exactly the point of this pieces.

327
00:25:51,967 --> 00:26:03,134
Scott: He says how this drill is such a powerful incredibly dangerous You know monster of a drill that you can drill anything with it But if it fails to drill that's your fault.

328
00:26:03,235 --> 00:26:04,199
Scott: and he compares it to.

329
00:26:04,219 --> 00:26:11,860
Scott: you know He compares Windows and Macintosh to like power drills you buy in Home Depot that are basically crap compared to the whole hog.

330
00:26:12,302 --> 00:26:16,560
Scott: But with those you can't really screw up because they're nice, you know homeowner drills.

331
00:26:17,823 --> 00:26:25,268
Rym: But anyway today being Monday and being a new week We were debating what to talk about and we realized we hadn't done a theme week in a while Theme week.

332
00:26:25,692 --> 00:26:30,620
Rym: and this there's an idea We've been kicking around for a while and we decided this would be the perfect week to do it for a number of reasons.

333
00:26:30,701 --> 00:26:40,571
Rym: But we decided to do our origin stories Now not the physical origin of the front row crew which we've already done But instead the origins of all of our geekeries know.

334
00:26:40,611 --> 00:26:41,796
Rym: how did we get into computers?

335
00:26:41,836 --> 00:26:42,880
Rym: How did we get into anime?

336
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:47,536
Rym: How did we find manga or video games or the secret topic?

337
00:26:47,556 --> 00:26:48,680
Rym: We'll talk about on Thursday?

338
00:26:48,961 --> 00:26:52,935
Scott: How did we become so skilled and knowledgeable in so many different areas?

339
00:26:53,356 --> 00:26:54,340
Rym: see that's Scott's view.

340
00:26:54,802 --> 00:26:55,426
Rym: I'm looking at it.

341
00:26:55,466 --> 00:26:57,679
Rym: more is how did I become interested in this?

342
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:07,204
Scott: See, I think the thing is is that for me personally I'm interested in things that I have skills in or I build skills in things I'm interested in.

343
00:27:07,245 --> 00:27:08,391
Scott: so they kind of go hand in hand.

344
00:27:08,934 --> 00:27:09,980
Rym: What about race car driving?

345
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,075
Rym: You have no race car driving skills and you're already do I mr.

346
00:27:13,136 --> 00:27:15,646
Scott: Go kart loser One.

347
00:27:15,991 --> 00:27:24,749
Rym: those were Wildwood go-karts where the only determiner and who wins is who got the one car that doesn't Constantly backfire.

348
00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:25,776
Scott: and is it any different in f1?

349
00:27:28,962 --> 00:27:29,223
Scott: Is it?

350
00:27:29,886 --> 00:27:32,619
Rym: I don't know if Kimi and Alonzo were in the same car?

351
00:27:33,101 --> 00:27:36,773
Scott: Well next year Kimi is gonna be in a Ferrari and Alonzo is gonna be in a McLaren.

352
00:27:36,793 --> 00:27:37,676
Scott: So we'll see what happens.

353
00:27:37,736 --> 00:27:47,515
Rym: Yeah anyway Yeah, now I was also inspired to this partly because in the forums lately There seemed to be a lot of recurring threads of how did you get into anime?

354
00:27:47,736 --> 00:27:48,760
Rym: What was your first anime?

355
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,171
Scott: Yep, so we're gonna cover that Wednesday.

356
00:27:52,854 --> 00:27:56,392
Scott: Yeah today we're gonna cover How do we get into the computer gig?

357
00:27:56,413 --> 00:27:57,700
Scott: because that's our jobs.

358
00:27:58,821 --> 00:28:03,358
Rym: So anyway today computers, you know, obviously we're interested in computers.

359
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:03,760
Rym: We're geeks.

360
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:12,260
Rym: We use computers a lot and it seems like a lot of people Really take computers for granted or just you know, their tools and nothing more which I'd take that view to a point.

361
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:18,920
Rym: But at the same time I can remember precisely how I became interested in computers and how I became good at them.

362
00:28:20,162 --> 00:28:20,967
Scott: Well, how did you?

363
00:28:21,571 --> 00:28:22,759
Rym: oh so you want me to go first?

364
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:29,339
Scott: I could go first also because I also precisely remember my early interactions with computerized devices.

365
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:34,072
Rym: Yeah Well, very simply I Always wanted to get on the Internet.

366
00:28:34,393 --> 00:28:35,940
Rym: I always wanted to have a computer.

367
00:28:36,421 --> 00:28:42,498
Rym: I'd seen war games and I was absolutely convinced that I could do all of those things with a computer.

368
00:28:42,658 --> 00:28:43,320
Rym: Uh-huh.

369
00:28:43,742 --> 00:28:51,320
Rym: And then when I got to middle school, I mean we had no computers in my elementary school It was the Catholic school We had like one Apple computer and one IBM computer that they never let me touch.

370
00:28:51,723 --> 00:28:53,599
Rym: But then when I got to fifth grade, I went to public school.

371
00:28:54,061 --> 00:29:03,451
Rym: They had a lot more money and they had a whole bunch of like Windows 311 computers with a terrible word processor on them in addition to a whole bunch of terrible terrible games.

372
00:29:04,393 --> 00:29:08,826
Rym: and I remember that I had to read this book called The Bear Stone.

373
00:29:08,846 --> 00:29:09,993
Rym: it was called the Bear Stone.

374
00:29:10,093 --> 00:29:11,200
Rym: It was about air stone.

375
00:29:11,441 --> 00:29:18,157
Rym: it was about this Indian kid as a reservation Indian kid and I had to write a book report on it.

376
00:29:18,177 --> 00:29:21,100
Rym: and Because I was one of the smart kids in the class.

377
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:29,919
Rym: They let like the five smart kids go to the computer lab and use this word processor to type their book report Instead of writing it by hand.

378
00:29:31,242 --> 00:29:39,407
Rym: So I made this book report and I put a bunch of clip art in it and I used three different fonts and I thought it was really awesome.

379
00:29:39,427 --> 00:29:46,920
Rym: and I made it and there was the spell checker and that was amazing to me and I printed it out on the special printer that at the school and I brought it home.

380
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:50,400
Rym: And my grandpa is a newspaper guy as in a typesetter.

381
00:29:50,741 --> 00:30:03,300
Rym: he spent most of his life working in old-school newspapers like manual mechanical printing presses and I showed this to him and he said something to the effect of I'm glad I'm retiring because my job is now obsolete

382
00:30:04,021 --> 00:30:04,221
Scott: yeah,

383
00:30:04,623 --> 00:30:13,716
Rym: and he'd show that he took that book report and he brought it to his work and he showed it to people and he Basically said look what my grandson did he can do all the work that we do.

384
00:30:13,736 --> 00:30:17,871
Rym: Yeah Wow, but then I mean still there was no internet.

385
00:30:17,891 --> 00:30:18,895
Rym: There was no online.

386
00:30:18,976 --> 00:30:19,940
Rym: I didn't have a computer.

387
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:23,738
Rym: It wasn't until I joined the computer club at my middle school.

388
00:30:23,798 --> 00:30:30,877
Rym: now Don't be under any illusions the computer club at my middle school was quite Oregon Trail the club.

389
00:30:31,138 --> 00:30:36,700
Rym: every Monday We would hang out after school in the computer lab with the nerdy guy who ran it playing Oregon.

390
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,925
Scott: Yeah, that's right.

391
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,135
Scott: and scorched earth in Carmen Sandiego.

392
00:30:40,195 --> 00:30:40,396
Rym: Nope.

393
00:30:40,436 --> 00:30:45,152
Rym: No Carmen Sandiego We had and scorched earth and stunts 4d racing.

394
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:52,303
Rym: Oh, that was the best frickin game And lhx which was a really good 286 Helicopter fighting game.

395
00:30:52,564 --> 00:30:56,416
Rym: All right, and just even then I didn't know anything about computers.

396
00:30:56,456 --> 00:30:57,680
Rym: I barely knew how they worked.

397
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:01,460
Rym: I knew to type scorch bat and I could play scorched earth.

398
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:06,620
Rym: Yeah, and I kind of knew that the bigger the resolution was the smaller things were on the screen.

399
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,586
Rym: But I didn't know why.

400
00:31:07,606 --> 00:31:09,820
Rym: mm-hmm and I often broke the computers.

401
00:31:10,422 --> 00:31:12,832
Rym: Oh, but I bothered my parents complete.

402
00:31:12,852 --> 00:31:14,700
Rym: I wanted a computer, you know, can I have a computer dad?

403
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,284
Rym: can I have a computer?

404
00:31:15,304 --> 00:31:15,990
Rym: that have a computer?

405
00:31:16,011 --> 00:31:16,858
Rym: that can have a computer dad.

406
00:31:16,878 --> 00:31:21,167
Rym: and One day my parents decided that This that happened often.

407
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:24,360
Rym: we didn't have a lot of money, but I was a kid and I didn't know better.

408
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,425
Rym: So I thought we had a lot of money.

409
00:31:26,048 --> 00:31:28,097
Rym: So I always asked for things like give me a piano.

410
00:31:28,117 --> 00:31:33,294
Rym: I need a piano I need a computer and I usually got them and eventually my parents bought me a computer.

411
00:31:33,715 --> 00:31:39,100
Rym: So we went and we bought a Packard Bell Sx2.

412
00:31:39,602 --> 00:31:42,469
Rym: a hacker tell that was my first computer.

413
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:44,895
Rym: It came with Windows 3 1 1.

414
00:31:44,895 --> 00:31:46,580
Rym: Oh for work groups.

415
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:52,140
Rym: Well, it came with Windows 3 1 on it, but it came with the discs to upgrade that to 3 1 1 for work groups.

416
00:31:52,461 --> 00:31:56,314
Rym: Well work groups, which was the first windows that had network capabilities that worked.

417
00:31:56,635 --> 00:31:58,240
Scott: that yeah, but they were kind of useless.

418
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:03,960
Rym: They didn't actually work because I didn't have a LAN or anything Hyper terminal.

419
00:32:05,043 --> 00:32:06,336
Scott: But I got I used it.

420
00:32:07,543 --> 00:32:08,787
Rym: It came also.

421
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:12,860
Rym: Windows was not the primary operating system on this computer nor was DOS.

422
00:32:13,943 --> 00:32:21,796
Rym: They were both there but over both of them Like running on top of Windows, which itself was running on top of DOS was Packard Bell Navigator.

423
00:32:21,816 --> 00:32:26,620
Rym: Oh My god, did that make me hate computers?

424
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,379
Rym: It was the worst thing ever and it didn't make sense.

425
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:32,792
Rym: but I eventually started using DOS and learning how to do things.

426
00:32:33,194 --> 00:32:41,179
Rym: and I started learning how to actually you know install programs correctly by asking people in trial and error and breaking things and fixing things.

427
00:32:41,199 --> 00:32:47,799
Rym: and Eventually, I learned how to get on BBS's by dialing a phone number at hyper terminal.

428
00:32:47,819 --> 00:32:56,750
Rym: I Guess I'll stop there and let Scott tell his first bit before I go on about the rest because I sure we can talk a Lot about our first internet experiences.

429
00:32:57,233 --> 00:32:58,780
Scott: That's a good place right there.

430
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:09,380
Scott: So I guess I kind of knew about computers before Kindergarten like I'd seen them on TV and I had an Atari 2600 at some point and you know all that stuff.

431
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,691
Scott: So I was definitely interested in technologies and stuff.

432
00:33:11,751 --> 00:33:14,418
Scott: and you know, if you had put a computer near me I would have been like ooh.

433
00:33:15,962 --> 00:33:17,426
Scott: But it wasn't until kindergarten.

434
00:33:17,446 --> 00:33:18,509
Scott: where I actually got at.

435
00:33:18,669 --> 00:33:22,139
Scott: one is in my school elementary school.

436
00:33:23,022 --> 00:33:29,626
Scott: every single classroom in the school or at least the majority of them had an Apple - in them somewhere and there was a lab or two.

437
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:41,330
Scott: that was basically a room full of Apple - and You know, I didn't get very many opportunities to actually touch the Apple - we just kind of sat there looking at you And I remember always looking at it.

438
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:42,355
Scott: Like I want to play with that.

439
00:33:42,596 --> 00:33:43,360
Scott: I want to play with that.

440
00:33:43,701 --> 00:33:45,008
Scott: When am I gonna get to play with that?

441
00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:47,240
Scott: and day after day, you know kindergartens a half day.

442
00:33:47,361 --> 00:33:49,439
Scott: So what you know what chance are you gonna get?

443
00:33:50,640 --> 00:34:10,322
Scott: They eventually let me play with it a few times and you know All I remember from elementary school was that I pretty much used the Apple - and later on Macintosh's all throughout elementary school in school and Every chance I could and we mostly played Oregon Trail and this other really good game With dr.

444
00:34:10,362 --> 00:34:15,420
Scott: Livingston and you had to find him I presume and all sorts of other fun games.

445
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:24,513
Scott: But the one thing I remember the most was that teachers would always like slowly Oh number word munchers Fucking word munchers, man.

446
00:34:24,553 --> 00:34:25,239
Scott: That was shit.

447
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:29,934
Scott: They would always slowly explain to everyone like exactly how to use the computer.

448
00:34:29,954 --> 00:34:30,396
Scott: They'd like art.

449
00:34:30,436 --> 00:34:33,195
Scott: everyone push down All right, everyone push enter.

450
00:34:33,275 --> 00:34:33,719
Scott: and I just like.

451
00:34:35,262 --> 00:34:37,331
Scott: I just looked at it and it made sense.

452
00:34:37,371 --> 00:34:38,355
Scott: I'm like their arrows.

453
00:34:38,596 --> 00:34:39,540
Scott: that thing is highlighted.

454
00:34:39,821 --> 00:34:41,428
Scott: I pushed the number of what I want to do.

455
00:34:41,447 --> 00:34:43,235
Scott: I push enter to make things go.

456
00:34:43,538 --> 00:34:44,020
Scott: I'm all set.

457
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,054
Rym: I guess that seems to be the common thread among you.

458
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:48,708
Rym: know Geeks know about computers versus people who don't.

459
00:34:48,768 --> 00:34:51,120
Rym: is that we didn't have any inherent skill or anything.

460
00:34:51,179 --> 00:35:00,882
Rym: We just weren't afraid to dick around with a computer break it Break out try to fix it and just constantly poke at it and try to figure out why things Remember

461
00:35:00,902 --> 00:35:12,460
Scott: I was messing around with like word munchers debug menus and stuff and switching discs out and trying different things and you know Everyone else seemed to be pretty uncomfortable with me fooling around I guess because those things cost a lot of money.

462
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:18,999
Rym: Oh God when we brought the computer home My parents were like the whole family was standing around it like it was fire and we were cavemen.

463
00:35:20,281 --> 00:35:25,625
Rym: We've got it on and it's sitting there in packet Bell Navigator and my parents are like So what do we use it for?

464
00:35:26,067 --> 00:35:27,753
Rym: and I was like, I'll handle this.

465
00:35:27,773 --> 00:35:32,907
Rym: and I sat down and I knew probably 1% more about that computer than my family.

466
00:35:32,927 --> 00:35:37,159
Rym: Yeah, but because of that 1% I was God to them about it.

467
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:39,458
Rym: But yet they were afraid I was gonna break it.

468
00:35:39,821 --> 00:35:44,490
Rym: So they tell me to do something but then when I started to move the mouse around they'd yell at me Don't break it.

469
00:35:44,551 --> 00:35:45,038
Rym: Don't break it.

470
00:35:45,221 --> 00:35:47,459
Rym: You want me to do it or not?

471
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,570
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

472
00:35:49,631 --> 00:35:51,620
Scott: Yeah anyway.

473
00:35:53,141 --> 00:36:10,520
Scott: So in elementary school, I got a lot of Apple to skills and in the summer, you know a couple summers I forget which ones I went the like the local school system had like a summer program where you could like take two classes Classes and basically you spent half your day doing one thing and half your day doing another thing and then lunch in the middle.

474
00:36:10,641 --> 00:36:15,204
Scott: So I would go there and I would always choose Gym and computers.

475
00:36:15,666 --> 00:36:20,380
Scott: cuz I'd go and I spent half my day playing dodgeball and that's been half my day playing Oregon Trail.

476
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:22,809
Scott: But I also learned logo.

477
00:36:22,829 --> 00:36:24,736
Scott: I was programming from the start bitches.

478
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:25,760
Rym: I remember logo.

479
00:36:26,141 --> 00:36:28,310
Scott: I'm moving that turtle around like a nobody's business.

480
00:36:28,591 --> 00:36:30,900
Rym: I turn the turtle into a helicopter and I use that instead.

481
00:36:31,902 --> 00:36:33,556
Scott: No, no, you gotta use the classic turtle.

482
00:36:33,677 --> 00:36:38,960
Scott: I mean Anyway, I was having the turtle solve mazes and stuff all on his own and shit like that.

483
00:36:39,402 --> 00:36:40,146
Scott: I knew what I was doing.

484
00:36:40,206 --> 00:36:54,147
Scott: I was mostly getting really really good at stunts 40 racing Yeah, and then in middle school, I think around the time I was 13 we got finally a computer in our house a 486 a spectacle Graphics and sound.

485
00:36:54,508 --> 00:36:55,210
Rym: yeah, we both had 486.

486
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:55,651
Rym: Scott had a DA.

487
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:56,293
Rym: it was an IBM Aptiva.

488
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:06,460
Scott: It had a 100 megahertz 486 DX for processor with 16 megabytes of RAM.

489
00:37:06,761 --> 00:37:09,879
Scott: I had four but it started out with eight and we upgraded it to six.

490
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,640
Rym: So you started with four and for like $200 upgraded it to eight.

491
00:37:13,761 --> 00:37:15,652
Scott: It was like for a hundred to a lot of money.

492
00:37:15,693 --> 00:37:17,223
Scott: We upgraded it to 16.

493
00:37:17,223 --> 00:37:19,040
Scott: It started out with eight megabytes.

494
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:27,520
Scott: We upgraded it to 16. now this thing it came with Windows 3.1 regular Windows 3.1 But it also came with OS to warp.

495
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:32,460
Rym: I have a copy of the final version of OS to war.

496
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:32,560
Rym: now.

497
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,860
Scott: Let me say OS to warp was actually kind of good.

498
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,615
Scott: The problem was is that no so that we there wasn't OS to warp native software.

499
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:41,220
Scott: besides what came with the computer?

500
00:37:41,741 --> 00:37:48,640
Scott: So we use the OS to warp native software sometimes but most of the time, you know, I wanted to play DOS games.

501
00:37:49,281 --> 00:37:55,060
Scott: That was pretty much the purpose of this computer was DOS games and a few Windows 3.1 games and yep printing out things for school.

502
00:37:55,365 --> 00:37:56,219
Rym: We all get into games.

503
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:01,880
Rym: But good God did I have an intricate series of batch scripts that would run the various games?

504
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,084
Rym: I had in the boot disks.

505
00:38:03,164 --> 00:38:05,933
Rym: I needed they needed a boot disk to play doom - yep.

506
00:38:06,053 --> 00:38:15,340
Scott: So eventually, you know, we I Rebooted the computer into you know, DOS Windows 3.1 mode, which I don't now understand is a dual boot and how that works.

507
00:38:16,404 --> 00:38:18,100
Scott: And we kept it that way most of the time.

508
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:30,800
Scott: so the DOS games worked and we used Windows and OS 2 eventually faded and then Windows 95 came out and I Learned how to format a hard drive and install Windows 95 and then we got AOL and Netscape.

509
00:38:31,082 --> 00:38:32,874
Rym: See the Internet is the fun part.

510
00:38:32,994 --> 00:38:37,642
Rym: Yeah, we don't dwell long We don't wanna go long in this episode or get into all the various tangents We could follow.

511
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:41,760
Rym: but the Internet was always this mysterious thing to me because I always heard about it.

512
00:38:42,262 --> 00:38:42,824
Rym: The Internet.

513
00:38:43,265 --> 00:38:47,580
Rym: but no one that because I didn't know anyone who knew about computers could give me a straight answer as to what?

514
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,270
Rym: It was or how I could connect to it.

515
00:38:49,632 --> 00:38:56,780
Rym: I knew that there was Prodigy and CompuServe and AOL But I didn't know which one of those was the Internet.

516
00:38:57,582 --> 00:38:59,738
Rym: I thought that those were separate and they kind of were back then.

517
00:39:00,441 --> 00:39:09,205
Rym: Being actually on the Internet back then was not something we could really do easily And we ended up getting Prodigy Classic.

518
00:39:09,667 --> 00:39:14,066
Scott: oh my friend had that for his P IBM ps1 with my 2400 baud modem.

519
00:39:14,106 --> 00:39:14,809
Rym: that was so slow.

520
00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:16,576
Rym: I couldn't even save my game in Mad Maze.

521
00:39:17,139 --> 00:39:21,800
Rym: Wow I used to play Magic the Gathering and chat rooms on Prodigy and a little bit of trivia.

522
00:39:22,303 --> 00:39:25,520
Rym: My first screen name ever was origins.

523
00:39:27,602 --> 00:39:39,512
Rym: I got it because there's a book on evolution that was sitting on top of our computer desk called origins something something something something Wow, that's kind of crazy though my parents used that name too for a while.

524
00:39:39,553 --> 00:39:42,563
Rym: so did my brother because we had like one handle for the whole house.

525
00:39:42,603 --> 00:39:46,479
Rym: and then eventually I figured out that I could set up different accounts for everybody.

526
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:53,838
Rym: and But the funny story here is when we got internet access we got Wow, which is a little known.

527
00:39:53,878 --> 00:40:02,755
Rym: It was the first Unlimited access dial-up internet and it was really cheap and that's probably why I went out of business real quick Mmm, but I got it.

528
00:40:02,795 --> 00:40:03,440
Rym: We got the internet.

529
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:09,798
Rym: I bugged my parents about my parents and we got a better computer and we got a 33 6 modem Holy shit.

530
00:40:10,362 --> 00:40:14,076
Rym: And then I dialed in to Wow and it was on the internet.

531
00:40:14,337 --> 00:40:20,697
Rym: and I opened up Netscape and the first thing I ever did on the internet was type into the search bar in.

532
00:40:20,757 --> 00:40:22,162
Rym: I don't know what search engine I Was in.

533
00:40:22,182 --> 00:40:26,499
Rym: I think it was the Wow search quotes bomb making instruction.

534
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:34,280
Rym: Oh No, and my parents Harris and my parents who were standing behind me said these days my uncle was there too.

535
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,367
Rym: He has something to the effect of.

536
00:40:35,468 --> 00:40:47,000
Rym: I figured that's what he would search for And I pretty much spent the first month looking for it the most subversive things I could find Yeah, and I didn't find a lot because the internet wasn't actually so happening back then.

537
00:40:47,341 --> 00:40:50,031
Scott: Yeah, basically for me the internet like.

538
00:40:50,051 --> 00:40:52,400
Scott: I wasn't quite sure what the deal was at all.

539
00:40:52,480 --> 00:41:05,319
Scott: like I kind of vaguely understood that the computer was gonna connect to something to get more computer action and Like, you know information coming from somewhere into the computer, but I didn't really get it like.

540
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:08,740
Scott: oh Eventually, it was like oh shit telephone lines.

541
00:41:09,001 --> 00:41:19,583
Scott: I get it because my friend had an IBM ps1 with prodigy classic and he would you know They would call another computer on the phone and do all this prodigy stuff and I'd be like, oh It's just this program.

542
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:20,547
Scott: lets you do all these cool things.

543
00:41:21,571 --> 00:41:23,700
Scott: and the OS to warp had an icon in it.

544
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:30,460
Scott: It's an information superhighway with a little folder Picture of a car and a highway and I was like if only I could get that to work.

545
00:41:30,601 --> 00:41:33,195
Scott: But we had a 14-4 modem in the computer.

546
00:41:33,276 --> 00:41:36,093
Scott: it came with it But we didn't have a phone line if we never hooked it up.

547
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:52,386
Scott: until later We eventually got AOL and hooked it up and around that time I was you know understanding how this thing worked and you know Minimizing AOL and opening Netscape and I was disconnecting from AOL and dialing into the local library with hyper terminal To check if there were books.

548
00:41:52,587 --> 00:41:57,690
Rym: I was dialing into all sorts of wares things as I discovered There were a lot of wares BBS is about.

549
00:41:57,771 --> 00:41:59,640
Scott: yeah, I didn't quite figure out the wares.

550
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:04,180
Scott: I was mostly downloading share wares and then deleting the funny funny story about wares.

551
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:18,595
Rym: I'll talk about this more on gaming day probably but the first games I got for the computer other than the ones my parents bought Right away like with with our second computer the Pentium 200 we bought two games with it But before that the first games I got that weren't with the computer.

552
00:42:19,318 --> 00:42:26,960
Rym: some friend I met at like Starbase, which was like Space Camp Light I I went over to his house one day and he had all these games and I thought they were awesome.

553
00:42:27,322 --> 00:42:29,029
Rym: So he was like, oh here I'll give them to you.

554
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:32,483
Rym: and I was like what you'll give me these games, dude How much of these.

555
00:42:32,523 --> 00:42:35,134
Rym: cause he's like, I'm just gonna copy the disks.

556
00:42:35,174 --> 00:42:36,419
Rym: I'm not giving you the original.

557
00:42:36,439 --> 00:42:40,180
Rym: and Then at that point I didn't think but isn't that illegal?

558
00:42:40,281 --> 00:42:42,803
Rym: I thought oh games are free Mm-hmm.

559
00:42:43,124 --> 00:42:46,579
Rym: I just did never even occurred to me that you had to pay for things for computers at that point.

560
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:52,563
Scott: Well, see like I kind of understood that, you know games that came on floppy disks You just copy like.

561
00:42:52,604 --> 00:42:53,768
Scott: that's how he got Wolfenstein 3d.

562
00:42:53,848 --> 00:42:55,253
Scott: It's everyone got Wolfenstein 3d.

563
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:58,686
Scott: Yeah, but games that came on CDs It's like oh you can't copy that.

564
00:42:58,746 --> 00:43:02,180
Scott: I mean and I was like you could just copy the CD to the hard drive.

565
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,679
Scott: We all understood how you could do that, but no one had a hard drive big enough to get.

566
00:43:05,699 --> 00:43:08,306
Rym: that Drive was 540 megabytes.

567
00:43:08,326 --> 00:43:10,280
Scott: mine was seven hundred and something megabytes.

568
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,469
Scott: So but I get the OS took up too much space.

569
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:17,208
Rym: remember we knew someone who got a CD burner Real early.

570
00:43:17,248 --> 00:43:17,853
Rym: it burned at 1x.

571
00:43:19,761 --> 00:43:22,089
Scott: See I was cool cuz I had a 4x CD ROM.

572
00:43:22,129 --> 00:43:23,414
Scott: it could read at 4x.

573
00:43:23,474 --> 00:43:23,795
Scott: Damn.

574
00:43:23,855 --> 00:43:24,598
Rym: I had a 2x.

575
00:43:24,658 --> 00:43:29,354
Rym: Yeah Yeah, so see we go in leaps and we like we leapfrog past each other.

576
00:43:29,414 --> 00:43:41,380
Rym: cuz I had the crappy 46s X and Scott had the awesome DX, but then I had the Pentium 200 and then I got the Pentium 3 450 megahertz and then I got the Thunderbird gigahertz.

577
00:43:41,721 --> 00:43:43,968
Scott: Yeah, it was a good time, which I still have.

578
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:47,680
Scott: and then I got the Athlon XP, which I still have.

579
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:50,044
Scott: Anyway, yep.

580
00:43:50,325 --> 00:43:55,460
Scott: The point is is that you know after we got on the Internet's our knowledges started to increase exponentially.

581
00:43:55,942 --> 00:44:00,340
Scott: I learned mad programming skills at summer camp and school and elsewhere.

582
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:04,979
Rym: Yep, my fiddling with serial cables turned into fiddling with giant networks at IBM.

583
00:44:05,842 --> 00:44:21,693
Scott: So anyone who thinks that we don't know about technology, I've been technology and computer since kindergarten I would sit there on my 486 sx2 playing with like Presentation making software for hours.

584
00:44:21,913 --> 00:44:23,860
Scott: Yeah, I mean most of the stuff we did was games.

585
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,260
Scott: I mean, I did a whole lot of playing of CD-ROM based DOS games.

586
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:36,340
Scott: I did a lot of writing stupid things and basic Yeah, but you know while doing those things I was forced to learn about the computer.

587
00:44:36,441 --> 00:44:38,419
Scott: I mean, how am I supposed to be able to you know?

588
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:44,440
Scott: Install things and configure sound cards and all that without learning about IRQs DMA hard drives?

589
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,145
Rym: Yes, you kids are spoiled today.

590
00:44:46,165 --> 00:44:47,930
Rym: You realize before sound blaster.

591
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:49,795
Rym: There was no sound on computers.

592
00:44:50,176 --> 00:44:51,680
Rym: You couldn't play sound.

593
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:56,939
Scott: Yeah, do you guys understand what DirectX does and what you know as DL and all these other API's do?

594
00:44:57,039 --> 00:44:57,240
Scott: is that?

595
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:15,687
Scott: If I write a game I can make that game play sound by using DirectX direct sound and that way no matter what sound Card your computer has if that sound card is supported by direct sound which every sound card in the universe is pretty much The sound will work Without direct sound.

596
00:45:15,767 --> 00:45:25,507
Scott: back in the DOS days if you wanted to have a game to have sound That game had to know which sound card you had and it had to have support Specifically for your sound card.

597
00:45:25,627 --> 00:45:34,018
Rym: and then in the install you had to go and specify the IRQs and DMAs which were the interrupt requests and the direct memory access.

598
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:39,420
Scott: yeah And you know you either had to know them or you had to hope that the automatic detection worked.

599
00:45:39,662 --> 00:45:41,180
Scott: We never worked on my computer.

600
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,531
Scott: It worked all the time because my computer was awesome.

601
00:45:43,672 --> 00:45:44,175
Rym: see a lot.

602
00:45:44,255 --> 00:45:51,380
Rym: on a lot of computers though It would just crash and in fact the auto detects would usually say if nothing happens in five minutes it crashed.

603
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,022
Rym: Don't use it.

604
00:45:52,283 --> 00:45:57,200
Rym: Yep, because it would probe the hardware physically and some hardware didn't like being probed.

605
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,024
Scott: No, some hardware did not like.

606
00:45:59,425 --> 00:46:01,350
Rym: I still remember my sound blaster.

607
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:01,430
Rym: God.

608
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:04,117
Rym: I hope I got I had all this.

609
00:46:04,177 --> 00:46:07,812
Scott: is it turning into the Old-dos computer episode and not the?

610
00:46:07,872 --> 00:46:09,079
Scott: where did you learn computer?

611
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:09,220
Scott: Yeah?

612
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:13,478
Rym: I think I'll hold that off for another day because I have great stories about my old advanced wave effects.

613
00:46:13,478 --> 00:46:15,626
Scott: 32 I have mad 486.

614
00:46:15,626 --> 00:46:21,261
Rym: Oh and my friend can who had the much vaunted R64?

615
00:46:21,281 --> 00:46:26,740
Rym: whoa, yeah, like the best sound card in the world and I was so envious until now that I know more.

616
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,719
Rym: I realized that we both effectively had the same sound card.

617
00:46:29,961 --> 00:46:34,060
Scott: The point is is like a year before I got out of like my junior senior year of high school.

618
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:41,640
Scott: I think it was junior year You know I had a job and I saved up a thousand dollars and bought a computer and slowly added more and more stuff to it.

619
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:54,200
Scott: And I had Windows 95 be on there and I you know I started playing with Red Hat Linux and I had my own 56k modem in my room with my own phone line and my own internet bill and I was really doing some good stuff.

620
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:55,849
Scott: And that's where I learned most of my shit.

621
00:46:56,211 --> 00:46:58,000
Scott: At least that's where I started to learn most of my shit.

622
00:46:58,222 --> 00:46:59,893
Rym: I was looking at how to make bombs.

623
00:47:00,195 --> 00:47:15,719
Scott: Yeah Well, I think I don't remember what the first thing I did in the internet was but I do remember that I spent a lot of time on like Yahoo AltaVista GeoCities and I was either looking for games or Making HTMLs and all that sort of thing.

624
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:20,820
Scott: Yep, I learned how to make HTMLs and web pages before I had a computer with an internet connection.

625
00:47:21,132 --> 00:47:33,922
Scott: Yeah because I remember I was at summer camp and I learned HTML and C and then I got home and then we got the 486. so that's you know, and then we all know I think we had the 486 but then we got on the internet We got a. well So it was.

626
00:47:33,942 --> 00:47:45,327
Rym: I remember when someone explained to me what HTML was and he basically said oh You just write text like words and then you have these tags that you stick around that tell the computer how to show those Words and I said, oh, that's easy.

627
00:47:45,347 --> 00:47:56,257
Scott: It's really weird when I think about it now because Even pretty much up until like the second last year of high school I didn't know I wasn't like beyond the line of yeah.

628
00:47:56,297 --> 00:48:00,690
Scott: now, you know God, I wasn't until I got that Pentium 3 that I really knew.

629
00:48:01,151 --> 00:48:11,488
Scott: so it's surprising like how much I learned at RIT Even though in my mind I knew just as much now as I knew at the beginning of RIT except for what I learned in Classes, but that's so not true.

630
00:48:11,628 --> 00:48:13,639
Scott: Yeah, I learned so many things at RIT.

631
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,932
Rym: The thing is a lot of what we've learned wasn't from classes directly.

632
00:48:16,972 --> 00:48:17,454
Scott: No wasn't.

633
00:48:17,474 --> 00:48:19,040
Scott: it was just from having computers.

634
00:48:19,321 --> 00:48:23,620
Rym: Yeah, I mean I've learned more from filling with my busted ass computer here that I've learned in school.

635
00:48:23,961 --> 00:48:36,455
Scott: Yeah, I learned most of my Linux stuff from just dealing with gen 2. for God It's like four years now almost So many years of gen 2ing and Ubuntu ing and Linux ing.

636
00:48:36,716 --> 00:48:37,740
Rym: but we don't want to go long.

637
00:48:37,868 --> 00:48:38,361
Scott: No we don't.

638
00:48:38,441 --> 00:48:48,168
Rym: so stay tuned tomorrow and we'll talk in much greater detail probably about the origins of our video gaming ways or maybe our Role-playing and board gaming ways.

639
00:48:48,329 --> 00:48:49,033
Rym: Oh one of the two.

640
00:48:49,053 --> 00:48:49,696
Rym: I don't know.

641
00:48:49,716 --> 00:48:50,600
Rym: It's mystery.

642
00:48:50,865 --> 00:48:51,640
Scott: Maybe we all right.

643
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:59,722
Scott: If you we're gonna either tomorrow is gonna be an episode talking about our video game Ways or our board and role-playing game ways.

644
00:48:59,822 --> 00:49:01,704
Scott: go to the forum and vote.

645
00:49:09,009 --> 00:49:11,694
Rym: and that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

646
00:49:11,714 --> 00:49:13,822
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for our opening theme.

647
00:49:14,224 --> 00:49:18,637
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontrowcrew.com.

648
00:49:19,279 --> 00:49:21,747

Scott: You can send your email feedback to GeekNights at gmail.com And if you want you can leave us a voicemail at two oh six three three three one five three Seven.

651
00:49:33,936 --> 00:49:36,510
Rym: GeekNights airs every weeknight Monday through Thursday.

652
00:49:37,351 --> 00:49:42,846
Scott: GeekNights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience, but unlike those other talk shows.

653
00:49:43,227 --> 00:49:44,490
Scott: It's actually recorded at night.
