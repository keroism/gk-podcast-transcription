1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,992
Rym: It's Monday, May 22nd, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,373 --> 00:00:15,360
Rym: Tonight, we discuss Ubuntu.

3
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:18,193
Scott: Let's do this!

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,620
Rym: So a lot's happened since the last GeekNights.

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,240
Scott: Too much has happened.

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:33,089
Rym: We had a crazy geek end where we played Burning Wheel, found a whole bunch of anime that doesn't suck, and we got real tired and ate a lot of food.

7
00:00:33,249 --> 00:00:33,470
Rym: Yep.

8
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:34,694
Rym: I also sprained my ankle.

9
00:00:34,754 --> 00:00:35,717
Rym: It is mostly healed now.

10
00:00:35,777 --> 00:00:36,580
Rym: It is still swollen.

11
00:00:37,482 --> 00:00:38,529
Scott: Did you put ices on it?

12
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,018
Rym: No, you're really not supposed to.

13
00:00:40,761 --> 00:00:44,960
Scott: Well, you put it on, I think it's the timing and duration that you have to get right, that everyone gets wrong.

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:55,358
Rym: Yep, yep, basically what I, because I sprained my ankle earlier in the weekend, like before everyone came over, and then I re-sprained it, like I sprained it the rest of the way while we were climbing the mountains.

15
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:55,660
Rym: Oh!

16
00:00:57,101 --> 00:01:04,667
Rym: And I had to just, you know, go up the rest of the way of the mountain and then come back down, and it was all swollen, and I'm like, hmm, it's obviously sprained.

17
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:07,820
Rym: I'm going to look online and see what the internet has to say about ankle sprains.

18
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:12,018
Scott: Like back in the day, you used to just ask your mom, and now, oh, nope, computer knows best.

19
00:01:12,179 --> 00:01:12,440
Rym: Yep.

20
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,764
Rym: Well, actually, I went to a bunch of sites, and they all said the same thing, and I looked, and oh, it's a Grade 1 sprain.

21
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:18,652
Rym: Therefore, do this.

22
00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:24,637
Rym: And all the sites basically said, you can put ice on it if you want because it makes it feel good.

23
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:29,920
Rym: You can isolate it or put a wrap around it to not let the ankle move to make it feel better.

24
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:34,876
Rym: All of those things will make it heal poorly and possibly permanently damage you.

25
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:35,940
Scott: Oh, really?

26
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:47,995
Rym: Apparently, unless you have a like Grade 2 or 3 sprain, which, apparently at Grade 2, you'll have big old bruising, and it's obvious you have a bad sprain, and Grade 3 you won't be able to stand up at all.

27
00:01:48,499 --> 00:01:48,560
Scott: Oh.

28
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:55,246
Rym: But they were like, if it's a Grade 1, you should just walk it off, and in fact, move your ankle around a lot even though it hurts.

29
00:01:55,749 --> 00:02:01,474
Rym: Otherwise, when the tendons fix themselves, they won't fix themselves right, and your ankle won't be able to move that far again.

30
00:02:01,495 --> 00:02:02,237
Rym: Uh-oh.

31
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:03,000
Scott: Yeah.

32
00:02:04,486 --> 00:02:06,640
Rym: So I just walked it off, and now my ankle feels fine.

33
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,047
Scott: GeekNights, now the medical advice podcast.

34
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:14,060
Rym: Yes, so while you're at it, eat a whole bunch of uncooked beans and bean sprouts.

35
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,957
Scott: Make sure to take some garlic, put it in oil, let it sit for like a week, and then drink the whole thing.

36
00:02:19,278 --> 00:02:19,800
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

37
00:02:21,221 --> 00:02:25,359
Rym: You find a mushroom, the best way to find out if it's poisonous or not is to eat three or four of them.

38
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:30,030
Scott: When you want to cross the street, don't look both ways.

39
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,480
Scott: Just, you know, kind of walk real slow.

40
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,832
Scott: No, no, just run right out as when the car is right about to come.

41
00:02:35,852 --> 00:02:36,875
Scott: Yeah, you get the idea.

42
00:02:37,016 --> 00:02:37,277
Rym: Yeah.

43
00:02:37,337 --> 00:02:37,939
Rym: Yeah.

44
00:02:39,521 --> 00:02:41,530
Scott: Still tired, going to sleep right after this.

45
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,800
Rym: Yeah, I almost fell asleep on the way to work.

46
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,987
Rym: I almost fell asleep on the way home from work.

47
00:02:46,088 --> 00:02:47,734
Rym: Luckily, I didn't fall asleep at work.

48
00:02:48,176 --> 00:02:49,260
Scott: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

49
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:57,848
Rym: No, we're gonna do an episode on Burning Wheel soon, because we finally tried to run a game of it, even though we ran the game at about midnight.

50
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:02,480
Scott: And we ran it, I think we did, but yeah, we'll talk about it when we talk about it.

51
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:02,941
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

52
00:03:04,104 --> 00:03:09,360
Rym: But also, today was the first day of my new job, since for those of you who listen regularly, I quit IBM.

53
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,198
Scott: Sayonara International Business Machine Co.

54
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:18,611
Rym: I already like my new job a thousand times more.

55
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:20,600
Scott: All right, we'll see how long that lasts.

56
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,365
Rym: Yeah, well, one thing, I'm doing stuff.

57
00:03:22,426 --> 00:03:27,100
Rym: Like, I did more today than I did in probably the last month of working at IBM.

58
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:34,220
Scott: See, I think when I started my job, I was doing things for a good few months, and then it slowly faded into nothingness.

59
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:41,360
Scott: So, I'm thinking maybe just what we have to do as tech guys who want to work, is we have to keep switching jobs.

60
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:48,380
Scott: Get a new job, do all the work they have for you until it's all done, because we're so badass, we do it all, and then switch, get a new job.

61
00:03:49,281 --> 00:03:54,560
Rym: Well, I think with this job, the work's gonna keep coming, because it's not like my previous job, which was mostly reactive.

62
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,480
Rym: I didn't get to do anything fun, I was mostly maintaining what was already there.

63
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,473
Scott: Yep, I'm sure that some jobs, you know, will have longer durations of work to do.

64
00:04:01,553 --> 00:04:11,760
Scott: Some jobs might even have years of work to do, but I don't think there's a job out there that can provide a steady flow of work forever, that is still interesting and enjoyable.

65
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,580
Rym: But at least with this job, I won't be sitting in front of a computer all day.

66
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,600
Scott: Yep, at least not for a good long while.

67
00:04:16,701 --> 00:04:20,180
Rym: In fact, I'll be wandering around the Bronx, going to hospitals, and poking at bits.

68
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,489
Scott: Maybe I should just try to find a new job soon.

69
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:25,859
Scott: I've been kind of real lazy, like, eh...

70
00:04:26,665 --> 00:04:28,240
Rym: Do any of your coworkers listen to GeekNights?

71
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,711
Scott: They don't even know it exists as far as I know.

72
00:04:31,234 --> 00:04:32,340
Scott: If they do, they haven't said anything.

73
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,179
Rym: I know everyone I worked with at IBM who I liked knows about GeekNights now.

74
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,121
Scott: Cool.

75
00:04:38,305 --> 00:04:42,759
Scott: Yeah, what I'll probably do is I'll wait until the end of the summer, and then...

76
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,679
Rym: Yeah, after all the crazy vacation times.

77
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:49,360
Scott: Yeah, after I use all my vacations, then I'll start to look, and then maybe in the new year I can get a new job.

78
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,900
Rym: Now, the best part of all this is I quit my job, and I left Friday.

79
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:59,940
Rym: Turn in my badge, sign the forms promising not to recruit people from IBM to my new job or anything.

80
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,425
Rym: They actually made me sign a form specifically.

81
00:05:02,445 --> 00:05:07,538
Rym: They're like, "You may not for one year try to recruit IBMers to whatever job you just

82
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:07,779
Rym: got.".

83
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:08,943
Scott: That's fine.

84
00:05:09,023 --> 00:05:13,280
Scott: IBM will eventually fire them or lay them all off, and then you can recruit them because they won't be IBMers.

85
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:14,464
Rym: Or they'll quit anyway.

86
00:05:14,524 --> 00:05:18,537
Rym: I mean, for the week before I left, and people were asking me like, "Oh, what's the job?

87
00:05:18,577 --> 00:05:18,817
Rym: What are you

88
00:05:18,837 --> 00:05:19,058
Rym: doing?".

89
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:25,240
Rym: And apparently the benefits I get kick the living shit out of anything IBM offers.

90
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:27,624
Scott: Yeah, but you know what the thing is?

91
00:05:27,644 --> 00:05:32,780
Scott: To do your job, you have to be knowledgeable about technology.

92
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,947
Rym: Yeah, I mean, a lot of people at IBM are smart.

93
00:05:35,987 --> 00:05:38,255
Rym: They don't know about new technology.

94
00:05:38,315 --> 00:05:39,800
Rym: Like, they don't know about Linux, really.

95
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,620
Scott: So the only one who can hire them is IBM because they're the only ones with old technology like that.

96
00:05:44,521 --> 00:05:46,049
Rym: I think computer associates could hire them.

97
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,980
Rym: I think Platinum IT could deal with them.

98
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,546
Scott: Computer associates is kind of bleh.

99
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:54,340
Scott: They don't seem to hire so many people, and they don't have new technology.

100
00:05:54,742 --> 00:05:55,358
Rym: That's what I was saying.

101
00:05:56,561 --> 00:05:58,948
Scott: But they don't have old, busted mainframes.

102
00:05:59,008 --> 00:06:02,720
Scott: The people who do the Java eWebSphere stuff could probably do computer associates.

103
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,125
Rym: Yeah, they could do it.

104
00:06:04,145 --> 00:06:06,120
Rym: I mean, if you know Java, you can get jobs anywhere.

105
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,719
Rym: Yeah, but the mainframe people have no jobs.

106
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,690
Rym: The problem is those jobs aren't fun.

107
00:06:10,931 --> 00:06:12,419
Rym: Writing Java for people is not fun.

108
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,692
Scott: If you got a job writing Java for someone, you're not a fun person.

109
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:18,740
Scott: So you don't mind.

110
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:27,100
Rym: I think the problem is that all the people who learn Java and do web application stuff with Java, there are better ways to do it.

111
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,500
Rym: And I don't know why anyone would actually want to use Java for something like that.

112
00:06:31,302 --> 00:06:31,804
Scott: I don't get it.

113
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:34,560
Scott: It's a corporate enterprise thing.

114
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,363
Rym: Yeah, but it's not any better.

115
00:06:36,383 --> 00:06:45,520
Rym: I tried to explain this to IBM hundreds of times that Java and all this enterprise stuff is not really better than the things you can get elsewhere.

116
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:55,000
Scott: There is the advantage in that the alternatives like PHP and all that other open source stuff, you have to get an expensive open source guy to do it.

117
00:06:55,501 --> 00:07:01,080
Scott: Java is something that every computer science student in the universe is taught nowadays.

118
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:10,080
Scott: So you can get some schmo crap ass CS guy or some crap ass outsourcing co to do it for you real crapily and real cheap.

119
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,539
Scott: Because, you know, hey, they don't know about software as long as it works, blah, blah, blah.

120
00:07:15,021 --> 00:07:17,880
Scott: It has a bunch of fancy marketing words on it from Sun.

121
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,820
Rym: Yeah, the word they use the most that bothers me also the most is scalable.

122
00:07:22,223 --> 00:07:24,200
Rym: Yeah, but they never like, Oh, it's scalable.

123
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,960
Scott: But what does scalable mean?

124
00:07:26,081 --> 00:07:26,957
Rym: I don't think they really know.

125
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,179
Scott: I know what scalable means.

126
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,420
Scott: You know what's fucking scalable?

127
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,820
Scott: Standard PC equipment with MySQL and Linux.

128
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,040
Scott: That's scalable.

129
00:07:36,341 --> 00:07:40,620
Scott: You can add as many fucking machines as you want, as much hardware and as much software.

130
00:07:41,142 --> 00:07:42,459
Scott: You'll never have to take it down.

131
00:07:43,481 --> 00:07:44,859
Scott: That's scalability right there.

132
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:50,119
Rym: So now I have to go through all the adventures of trying to figure out the optimum way to drive to and from work.

133
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,043
Scott: Hmm.

134
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:57,440
Rym: Which may or may not involve leaving my car somewhere in the Bronx and taking a train to get it every day.

135
00:07:57,681 --> 00:07:58,699
Scott: Then what do you do on the weekend then?

136
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:01,799
Rym: I won't have a car here because I don't really need one.

137
00:08:02,507 --> 00:08:02,760
Rym: Okay.

138
00:08:03,663 --> 00:08:04,840
Rym: Or I'll bring it back on the weekends.

139
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,297
Rym: I don't know.

140
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,299
Scott: I could park diagonally in the driveway then.

141
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,359
Rym: Yeah, you could.

142
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:08,684
Rym: Ooh.

143
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:14,120
Rym: I'm, I'm seriously still thinking about the motorcycle while the guy I'm working under actually used to ride.

144
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,680
Rym: And when I mentioned I wanted a motorcycle, it was like, Oh, get this, this information, information.

145
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:18,258
Rym: Oh my God.

146
00:08:18,744 --> 00:08:20,539
Scott: Yeah, but you got to ask more than one guy.

147
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,200
Rym: Well, the thing is every person I've asked and every website I've read said the exact same thing.

148
00:08:25,361 --> 00:08:27,680
Scott: That's generally a good indication.

149
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:28,170
Rym: Yep.

150
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:34,260
Rym: So I'm kind of poking around for classes and everything still, but I don't have time for the next, I don't know, month before I can do this.

151
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:34,756
Scott: Yeah.

152
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,440
Scott: If anyone out there listening to GeekNights rides or has ridden.

153
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:38,780
Rym: Yeah.

154
00:08:38,821 --> 00:08:39,212
Rym: Call in.

155
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:39,948
Rym: Yeah.

156
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,460
Rym: Cause I'm like seriously probably going to get a motorcycle within the next two years.

157
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,200
Rym: Probably guaranteed.

158
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:45,949
Scott: Yeah.

159
00:08:46,281 --> 00:08:47,380
Scott: Maybe me even also.

160
00:08:47,601 --> 00:08:52,440
Scott: Or we can like buy a cheap one together to learn on it and then sell it and then buy real ones.

161
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,980
Rym: Partly cause gas is real expensive and we all drive very far to work.

162
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:06,900
Scott: Like I can balance and I've ridden mini bikes and dirt bikes once, you know, and all sorts of things, but never a real motorcycle like, you know, on the road with cars.

163
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,337
Rym: On the road again.

164
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:09,319
Scott: No, it's not.

165
00:09:09,748 --> 00:09:09,999
Scott: Okay.

166
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:11,380
Rym: Yeah.

167
00:09:12,405 --> 00:09:12,535
Scott: So.

168
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:13,528
Rym: News.

169
00:09:14,503 --> 00:09:14,939
Scott: News, news.

170
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,959
Rym: Mostly old news from over the weekend.

171
00:09:17,543 --> 00:09:18,040
Scott: That's fine.

172
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,377
Scott: You know what?

173
00:09:19,022 --> 00:09:21,220
Scott: I got enough news for the whole week today.

174
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,939
Scott: So tomorrow you're going to hear today's news and on Wednesday you're going to hear today's news.

175
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,799
Scott: And on Thursday you might even hear yesterday's news.

176
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,499
Rym: That's the thing about not being on the internet all day at a job like I used to be.

177
00:09:33,801 --> 00:09:36,900
Rym: And also having a weekend where I really didn't have a chance to sit down at the internet.

178
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,320
Rym: When I got home from work today and I got on the internet, there was an infinite flood of news.

179
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,112
Rym: And it was like, Oh my God.

180
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:43,740
Rym: And I was like, that's the news.

181
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,458
Rym: That's my thing of the day.

182
00:09:44,943 --> 00:09:45,580
Rym: That's tomorrow's news.

183
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,216
Rym: That's the next news.

184
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,576
Rym: Oh my God.

185
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:48,475
Scott: Yep.

186
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,180
Scott: I was actually catching up on all sorts of weekend-y crap while at work.

187
00:09:53,341 --> 00:09:55,340
Scott: So I kind of had that going in the afternoon.

188
00:09:56,261 --> 00:09:58,380
Rym: Uh, I was running around the Bronx looking at hospitals.

189
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,117
Scott: Great.

190
00:09:59,800 --> 00:09:59,886
Scott: Okay.

191
00:10:00,482 --> 00:10:01,299
Scott: So my news.

192
00:10:02,181 --> 00:10:04,840
Scott: Apparently the Motor City Comic Con was this weekend.

193
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,180
Scott: I guess that's a Detroit comic convention.

194
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:07,540
Rym: Yeah.

195
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,080
Rym: Detroit is the Motor City AKA Hockey Town.

196
00:10:10,522 --> 00:10:10,610
Scott: Yep.

197
00:10:11,262 --> 00:10:13,340
Scott: Um, I don't think it was actually in Detroit.

198
00:10:13,663 --> 00:10:14,800
Scott: It might've been near Detroit.

199
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:20,299
Rym: Well, remember Detroit is a, is a large metropolitan area that includes a number of smaller...

200
00:10:20,581 --> 00:10:21,519
Scott: Oh, it was in Novi.

201
00:10:21,942 --> 00:10:23,099
Rym: Oh, that's where PangoCon was.

202
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,020
Scott: But it's not in the same hotel as PangoCon.

203
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,000
Scott: It was in some...

204
00:10:26,884 --> 00:10:26,972
Rym: Yeah.

205
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:27,899
Rym: Novi is big, you know.

206
00:10:28,424 --> 00:10:28,700
Scott: Yeah.

207
00:10:29,581 --> 00:10:32,820
Scott: It says here where it was, but I'm not going to find it in the article.

208
00:10:32,922 --> 00:10:33,759
Scott: You can read it yourself.

209
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:34,775
Rym: Novi is Detroit.

210
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,595
Rym: It's just... Yeah.

211
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,640
Rym: Like, you know, it's like the boroughs in New York City.

212
00:10:38,761 --> 00:10:43,860
Rym: They're not, not quite that integrated, but when you say Detroit, you generally mean all of Southeast Michigan.

213
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,400
Scott: Oh, it was the Rock Financial Showplace.

214
00:10:50,301 --> 00:11:00,240
Scott: So, early on opening day, a bunch of police from Novi Police Department and RIA and MPAA investigators...

215
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,720
Rym: You can see where this is going.

216
00:11:02,523 --> 00:11:02,640
Scott: Right?

217
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:10,719
Scott: Well, it says they were undercover agents, but this picture here shows a guy wearing an RIA jacket, so it doesn't look very undercover to me.

218
00:11:11,162 --> 00:11:12,660
Rym: You know what the, the answer to this is?

219
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:19,700
Rym: Right away, I would have people at the door that would ask, very simply, one, are you a police officer or law enforcement officer?

220
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,120
Rym: Two, are you a member or agent of the RIAA or MPAA?

221
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:23,779
Scott: They had a warrant.

222
00:11:24,783 --> 00:11:26,200
Rym: They had a warrant, you say?

223
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,019
Scott: They had a warrant.

224
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:27,960
Rym: Then they weren't undercover.

225
00:11:28,741 --> 00:11:31,960
Scott: That's the thing that's kind of scary, weird about this article.

226
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,760
Scott: Now, this really doesn't bother me that much, because there were guys selling bootlegs there.

227
00:11:38,405 --> 00:11:38,510
Scott: Duh.

228
00:11:39,181 --> 00:12:00,760
Scott: And it's, you know, there's a difference between sharing a ten-year-old movie on Bittorrent or sharing the latest TV show on Bittorrent the day after or whatever, and copying DVDs or taking movies off of TV that aren't on DVD and then selling them for money.

229
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:01,651
Rym: Yeah.

230
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:10,080
Rym: I mean, these guys aren't like the fan-subber circles or people who would trade tapes for tapes or sell fan-subs for like a dollar a tape so they could cover their shipping costs.

231
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,060
Rym: These guys are like, we make money off of other people's work.

232
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,759
Scott: This is the dealer's room.

233
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,499
Scott: Guys in the dealer's room with bootleg DVDs selling them.

234
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,280
Rym: You know, I've noticed that almost every Comic-Con I've been to, which have been very, very few...

235
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,394
Scott: No, no, no.

236
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,040
Scott: Here, check this out.

237
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,420
Scott: If you go to Midtown Comics in New York City, which is pretty much the comic store.

238
00:12:30,202 --> 00:12:32,800
Scott: They're one of the few places that buys every comic.

239
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:45,853
Scott: If you go there, right at the front, on the right side of this... Times freaking Square, on the right side of the store, you will see all sorts of shit on DVD for sale.

240
00:12:46,054 --> 00:12:47,040
Scott: that is not legitimate.

241
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,300
Scott: I remember I went in there.

242
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,540
Scott: Remember we got the Family Guy movie off the internet?

243
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:50,845
Rym: Yep.

244
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:57,198
Scott: The next day I went in there, they had the Family Guy movie playing on their TV and they're selling DVDs of it.

245
00:12:58,105 --> 00:12:58,899
Scott: It wasn't out yet.

246
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,580
Scott: And I was like, huh, so you got that.

247
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,540
Scott: And he's like, yeah, we got it early.

248
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,038
Scott: I'm like, yeah, me too.

249
00:13:06,941 --> 00:13:09,580
Scott: And then, remember when we had that Japanese Spider-Man thing?

250
00:13:09,965 --> 00:13:10,155
Rym: Yeah.

251
00:13:10,421 --> 00:13:11,318
Scott: They were selling that.

252
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,239
Scott: They took it off the internet, burned it to a DVD and were selling it.

253
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:23,740
Scott: Hey, RIA guys, if you're listening, you know, I don't like you, but Midtown Comics is seriously like bad, worse than any of these dealers.

254
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:28,919
Rym: Look at those comic conventions we always went to in Wildwood because they always happen to be there when we're down there.

255
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:36,120
Rym: Every time we go to those though, there's always people just selling bootleg DVDs like here's all of Buffy the Vampire Slayer for 50 bucks.

256
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,319
Scott: Yeah, what the hell?

257
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,880
Rym: I mean, anime cons and even gaming cons, it's like the exact opposite.

258
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,500
Rym: I mean, Otakon, if they catch a dealer with bootlegs, they kick them out.

259
00:13:46,341 --> 00:13:47,779
Rym: The dealer gets kicked out.

260
00:13:48,145 --> 00:13:48,378
Scott: Yup.

261
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,539
Rym: They've done it before.

262
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:59,722
Scott: Yeah, at this comic con, apparently what happened is some dealers like closed as they went to the police station for interrogation and any items that were listed on the warrant were confiscated.

263
00:13:59,742 --> 00:14:05,202
Scott: and some dealers didn't actually close because they had other merchandise to sell.

264
00:14:05,985 --> 00:14:09,340
Scott: and they said most dealers were open again or later.

265
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:15,900
Scott: One guy only had 20 DVDs, like that was just a small part of his boot, so he was, you know.

266
00:14:16,381 --> 00:14:18,810
Rym: I think the undercover agents thing was probably.

267
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,352
Rym: undercover.

268
00:14:19,412 --> 00:14:23,559
Rym: agents went in, found all the bootlegs, came back out, got a warrant, and then they came back.

269
00:14:24,926 --> 00:14:25,599
Rym: That would make sense.

270
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,400
Rym: The article was probably just stupidly written.

271
00:14:27,721 --> 00:14:28,578
Scott: That makes sense to me.

272
00:14:28,783 --> 00:14:29,380
Rym: That's my guess.

273
00:14:30,106 --> 00:14:31,040
Rym: I pulled that out of my ass.

274
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,698
Rym: That's not any sort of verifiable news.

275
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:42,380
Scott: The thing that I don't like about this, because this isn't all great, is that why are there RIA and MPA agents, like official investigators?

276
00:14:42,502 --> 00:14:43,158
Scott: You're not police.

277
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,919
Scott: You're just employees of some company.

278
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,119
Rym: That's why they went and got the police, and the fact that the police went along with this is kind of surprising because the police don't care.

279
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,400
Rym: They want to write speeding tickets and get money for it.

280
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,339
Rym: They don't make any money off of bootleggers.

281
00:14:54,982 --> 00:15:01,140
Scott: Yeah, so why can't we go be like GeekNights investigators and go investigate some companies?

282
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:01,738
Rym: We can.

283
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,000
Rym: It's called investigative journalism.

284
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:04,034
Rym: You want to do it?

285
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,076
Rym: You want to pull an old school mic?

286
00:15:06,381 --> 00:15:06,858
Scott: So what do we do?

287
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,539
Scott: We drive up to the RIA building, and what do we do?

288
00:15:10,021 --> 00:15:16,659
Rym: We walk in and we try to interview people until they kick us out, and then we pull an old school Michael Moore and stand outside with some sort of spectacle going on.

289
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,220
Scott: It's not really, it doesn't really work anymore.

290
00:15:19,321 --> 00:15:20,419
Scott: They figured out how to stop that.

291
00:15:20,802 --> 00:15:21,639
Rym: Yeah, just ignore you.

292
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:22,090
Scott: Yes.

293
00:15:23,501 --> 00:15:28,140
Scott: It hasn't worked since he did it, like, was it, wow, over ten years ago, right?

294
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:28,568
Rym: Yeah.

295
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:29,777
Scott: Ancient times.

296
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,100
Rym: Yeah, Scott Johnson had all those DVDs.

297
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,439
Scott: Yeah, we need a new trick if you want to do that.

298
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:35,426
Scott: Huh.

299
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,579
Scott: There was a movie, actually, I heard of.

300
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,920
Scott: Some guy did the Michael Moore thing to Michael Moore.

301
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,780
Rym: That's fantastic.

302
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,880
Scott: And I don't know if it worked, but I don't know the name of the movie.

303
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,120
Scott: I'll find it, and I'll mention it tomorrow.

304
00:15:50,144 --> 00:15:51,280
Scott: I heard about it from somewhere.

305
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:51,900
Rym: Yeah.

306
00:15:52,421 --> 00:15:57,559
Scott: But that's awesome, that someone was like outside his house, like, why won't you talk to me about the bullshit in your movie?

307
00:15:59,381 --> 00:16:03,120
Rym: But I mean, the RIAA with their agents, it's just like the BSA with their agents.

308
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,560
Rym: I mean, they basically come to your company and demand entrance so they can audit you.

309
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:15,814
Scott: The thing is, the BSA, the RIAA and the MPA are, they're legal groups, it's like a lawyer team.

310
00:16:16,901 --> 00:16:20,899
Scott: It's sort of like the ACLU, but for record companies instead of freedom people.

311
00:16:22,062 --> 00:16:23,820
Scott: The BSA is just Microsoft.

312
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:24,648
Rym: Yeah.

313
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,860
Scott: It's really just Microsoft in disguise with a little Adobe.

314
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:35,980
Rym: I mean, if I was ever in charge of a company where the BSA came, they wouldn't get into the door, and I'd tell them to fuck off, and I'd have my lawyers ready.

315
00:16:36,368 --> 00:16:36,473
Scott: Yeah.

316
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,259
Rym: They have no right to come in and audit me.

317
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,279
Scott: Unless the police, you know, want to arrest me.

318
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,980
Rym: They need probable cause and a warrant.

319
00:16:43,204 --> 00:16:43,289
Rym: Yeah.

320
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,039
Rym: You know what we got to do with Thursday On?

321
00:16:45,401 --> 00:16:46,459
Rym: How to deal with the police.

322
00:16:47,064 --> 00:16:47,639
Scott: That's a good one.

323
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:53,920
Rym: Because I've run afoul of police officers more than once for various things that I may or may not have done.

324
00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:01,599
Scott: And there's a lot of BS on the internet about what to do when police come, and a lot of it's wrong, and people might get in trouble if they listen to it.

325
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,755
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time, there's a lot of advice.

326
00:17:03,775 --> 00:17:04,339
Rym: that's gold.

327
00:17:04,963 --> 00:17:05,219
Scott: Golden.

328
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,880
Rym: I mean, police officers are very easy to deal with.

329
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:14,640
Rym: Even if you have committed a crime, they can't do much to you, and they usually will lie to you in order to get you in trouble.

330
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,031
Scott: Yep.

331
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,280
Scott: As long as they don't have any probable cause.

332
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,079
Scott: They don't give them any.

333
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:24,858
Rym: I mean, I don't want to sound like we think all cops are bad, but 99% of cops give 1% of cops a bad name.

334
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,280
Scott: Well, it's not that cops are bad people.

335
00:17:29,401 --> 00:17:32,500
Rym: There's a system that enforces bad behavior in cops, I think.

336
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:40,120
Scott: I think there is, and I think also, like a lot of cops, if you were hanging out with them at their house or whatever, they'd be all cool.

337
00:17:40,421 --> 00:17:47,300
Scott: But then when they're at their job, they're like, the job they have to do is be an asshole.

338
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,699
Scott: So it's like they're just doing their job, and well, they just are.

339
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:56,660
Scott: But when your job is be an asshole and bother people and piss them off, that doesn't make you very popular.

340
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,039
Scott: I mean, what if it was my job to go around and hit you on the head?

341
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,638
Scott: You'd be like, "Oh, Scott's a nice guy, it's just his job to hit you on the

342
00:18:03,678 --> 00:18:03,899
Scott: head.".

343
00:18:04,242 --> 00:18:06,335
Rym: I thought you were going to say, "What if it was my job to go around and be an

344
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:06,798
Rym: asshole?".

345
00:18:07,308 --> 00:18:07,598
Scott: No.

346
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,000
Scott: No, I'd do that anyway.

347
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:10,759
Rym: If only you got paid.

348
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,435
Scott: If only.

349
00:18:13,082 --> 00:18:16,700
Rym: You know, if GeekNights got paid for doing that, we wouldn't mean to do this podcast.

350
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,338
Rym: We'd just be rich.

351
00:18:18,067 --> 00:18:18,319
Scott: Awesome.

352
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,179
Rym: Just have a mansion.

353
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,000
Scott: The asshole mansion.

354
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,460
Scott: We shape it like a giant butthole.

355
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,178
Rym: Because I'm the juggernaut, bitch.

356
00:18:24,622 --> 00:18:25,219
Scott: Okay, okay.

357
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:25,939
Scott: What's your news?

358
00:18:26,621 --> 00:18:27,379
Rym: Oh yeah, news.

359
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,640
Rym: Okay, this is actually from Friday, and it's kind of related to IBM.

360
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:38,140
Rym: This is my last IBM news, since technically I was still an employee of IBM on Friday.

361
00:18:38,921 --> 00:18:43,299
Rym: Though I do not speak for IBM, I'd like to get that out now, so they don't sue me.

362
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,460
Scott: Like some RIA dudes, or some BSA dudes.

363
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:47,973
Rym: Yeah.

364
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,536
Rym: RIA dudes, Scott has a lot of pirated MP3s.

365
00:18:51,963 --> 00:18:52,380
Scott: Not really.

366
00:18:53,188 --> 00:18:53,600
Rym: Yeah, he does.

367
00:18:54,161 --> 00:18:57,260
Scott: Actually, most of my MP3s are totally- Most, but not all.

368
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,509
Rym: And you know how much, it's like $15,000 for MP3.

369
00:19:00,162 --> 00:19:01,519
Scott: You have all my MP3s also.

370
00:19:02,081 --> 00:19:03,119
Rym: Yeah, I also have many more.

371
00:19:03,381 --> 00:19:03,815
Scott: No, there you go.

372
00:19:04,923 --> 00:19:06,380
Rym: You have like 50 movies.

373
00:19:07,622 --> 00:19:08,919
Scott: Yeah, those movies are great.

374
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:17,520
Rym: Anyway, Lenovo, for those of you who don't know, you know I say that a lot, for those of you who don't know, do you guys know or not when I ask that?

375
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,959
Rym: I'm just curious, answer in the forums.

376
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:26,160
Rym: Lenovo is- Lenovo is the company that IBM sold their PC division to.

377
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:31,531
Scott: Right, so IBM used to make those black tower PCs, and the Aptivas- And the laptops.

378
00:19:32,401 --> 00:19:37,480
Scott: Did they also sell one of those, what were those things, the Intelliswetteners?

379
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,380
Rym: Intellistations?

380
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:38,770
Rym: Yeah.

381
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,140
Rym: They sold all of their PC and laptop manufacturers.

382
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,199
Scott: Mostly the Thinkpads.

383
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,379
Scott: The Thinkpads are the big deal.

384
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,420
Rym: Now, the thing is, the products didn't change.

385
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:51,538
Rym: Nothing really changed except that now the company called Lenovo owns them instead of the company called IBM.

386
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,700
Scott: So they're no longer called IBM Thinkpads, but they're the exact same fucking thing.

387
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,740
Rym: Yeah, they're even mostly made in the same places by the same people.

388
00:19:58,901 --> 00:20:00,920
Scott: It's like if Microsoft bought Apple, right?

389
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:10,100
Scott: And they took the Apple logo off of the MacBooks and the MacBook Pros, and they put the Windows logo on there, but they didn't change the hardware whatsoever.

390
00:20:11,122 --> 00:20:11,779
Scott: Not in any way.

391
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:28,980
Rym: Now, the State Department and various government agencies have decided that because Lenovo is owned by China, and because they're paranoid and/or protectionist of American industry, Lenovo computer equipment cannot be used in government-secure networks, period.

392
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,099
Rym: They're worried about China spying on the United States.

393
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,300
Scott: They're just stupid, and they don't understand technology.

394
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:45,078
Rym: Now, either they're stupid and they don't understand technology, or this is just a smokescreen to create a protective environment for the American computer industry that they're trying to revitalize.

395
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,499
Scott: That would be fine, but if they're trying to do that, why don't they just say so?

396
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,219
Scott: Because it's illegal.

397
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,198
Scott: Because I have no problem with that.

398
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,400
Rym: They can't do that because of all the international agreements on trade we've signed.

399
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:55,511
Scott: Uh-huh.

400
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:55,945
Rym: Yeah.

401
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:06,320
Rym: That's why there's all those scandals between us and Canada over softwood and hardwood lumber, because we've been putting tariffs on it even though that's illegal under NAFTA and all these other agreements we've signed.

402
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,100
Rym: So we've skirted around with loopholes.

403
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,019
Scott: Countries are so wussy lately.

404
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,820
Scott: It used to be back in the day, if you violated a treaty with someone, they'd come and kick your ass, and then they'd shoot you and bomb you.

405
00:21:16,101 --> 00:21:17,620
Rym: Hell, France invaded Germany.

406
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,788
Rym: Well, it wasn't really Germany yet, but France invaded.

407
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:21,414
Rym: what became Germany?

408
00:21:21,876 --> 00:21:23,979
Rym: because they insulted France once.

409
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,240
Scott: So now you have a guy breaking a treaty.

410
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,687
Scott: You said, he came up to you, imagine if I came up to you and I said, "I'm going to give you this for

411
00:21:31,788 --> 00:21:32,032
Scott: free.".

412
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:34,455
Scott: Then I give it to you and I say, "Where's my fucking

413
00:21:34,475 --> 00:21:34,697
Scott: money?".

414
00:21:35,284 --> 00:21:36,298
Scott: And you don't give me any?

415
00:21:38,283 --> 00:21:40,699
Scott: And then I get all messy with you.

416
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,120
Scott: You're going to start a fight.

417
00:21:42,241 --> 00:21:42,815
Scott: That's what you do.

418
00:21:44,081 --> 00:21:44,398
Rym: No, no, no.

419
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:52,500
Rym: So you go to the United Nations and you make a complaint, and then 12 years later they issue a statement, but then it gets vetoed and overturned and nothing happens.

420
00:21:54,184 --> 00:21:55,120
Rym: What do you want?

421
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,680
Scott: If we make a deal and the other guy doesn't come through, I'd kick your ass.

422
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,260
Rym: Yeah, but you can't really kick anyone's ass anymore.

423
00:22:03,601 --> 00:22:07,439
Rym: Unless you're a poor country with no natural resources, then you can kick all the asses you want.

424
00:22:09,781 --> 00:22:14,177
Scott: See, if we weren't using our military for stupid things, we could use it for ass kicking when needed.

425
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,259
Scott: That's what militaries are for.

426
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,800
Scott: Number one, make sure your people don't die from other people trying to kick your ass.

427
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,899
Scott: Number two, kick other people's ass.

428
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:32,940
Rym: Yeah, like if North Korea had suddenly actually invaded South Korea and all the horribleness that would follow, I'd be fine with the US kicking North Korea's ass and saving everyone.

429
00:22:33,741 --> 00:22:36,340
Rym: But I'm not fine with us invading random countries for fun.

430
00:22:36,641 --> 00:22:43,520
Scott: Yeah, it's okay to attack someone in proportional to the reason for attacking them.

431
00:22:44,301 --> 00:22:48,938
Scott: It's not okay to attack someone for no reason, especially if you're going to conquer their whole country.

432
00:22:51,141 --> 00:22:55,259
Scott: Let's say China did something to us like breaking a treaty, right?

433
00:22:55,981 --> 00:22:59,700
Scott: I wouldn't go over there and blow up all of China and start a giant war.

434
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,498
Rym: You just break whatever treaty you can break.

435
00:23:01,906 --> 00:23:02,240
Scott: Yeah.

436
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:02,980
Rym: Eye for an eye.

437
00:23:03,441 --> 00:23:04,080
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

438
00:23:04,661 --> 00:23:08,219
Scott: You know, it's like, hey, if you're not going to hold up on treaty, it's Civilization II.

439
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:17,380
Rym: Except you realize in Civilization II, I've come to the conclusion that unless I kill everyone else in the world, Civilization is doomed.

440
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:25,817
Rym: Every game I've ever played, I become awesome and powerful right away because I'm good at that stupid game because I wasted most of my life playing it.

441
00:23:26,761 --> 00:23:28,000
Rym: And I'll have this nice happy place.

442
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,799
Scott: You spend more than 50% of your life playing Civilization II.

443
00:23:32,805 --> 00:23:34,339
Rym: And there's a long stretch in high school.

444
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:40,478
Rym: I'll build up a giant awesome civilization, a totally non-aggressive, I never fight with anyone.

445
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,320
Rym: When I run into civilizations, that's my border.

446
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:51,560
Rym: And I just make my cities, I have science, science, science, I make my people as happy as possible, and I try to play as though I'm a real person doing everything I can to make my people happy and prosperous.

447
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:58,539
Rym: And the other nations are always afraid of me, they don't attack me and they stay away from me because I also have the science and the gunpowder and all that.

448
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,199
Scott: And they have none of those.

449
00:24:00,782 --> 00:24:17,739
Rym: But as technology gets greater and weapons become more powerful, sure they're less powerful than me because I have all the science, but they can still do a lot of damage, so they'll start declaring war on me and attacking me, and then as soon as I strike back at all, they freak out and ask for peace.

450
00:24:19,183 --> 00:24:20,699
Rym: And then 10 years later they attack me again.

451
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,039
Rym: And if they get nukes, they nuke me.

452
00:24:23,242 --> 00:24:23,818
Rym: And that's the end.

453
00:24:24,241 --> 00:24:28,380
Rym: The only way around this is to destroy everyone before they get the chance to destroy me.

454
00:24:31,692 --> 00:24:31,860
Scott: Awesome.

455
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:37,138
Rym: If I let them have one city, it'll build a goddamn nuke, it'll send a spy, it'll march into my capital, boom!

456
00:24:38,981 --> 00:24:43,480
Scott: Yeah, so if someone breaks your treaty, don't just give 'em the finger and grunt.

457
00:24:44,381 --> 00:24:44,918
Scott: Punch 'em in the face.

458
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:50,020
Rym: Yeah, I think the time will come when someone's gonna give America a nice cock punch.

459
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:59,600
Scott: And if the RA comes to bust up your DVD bootlegging, that's your own damn fault, but if they come in to bust up your perfectly okay by Scott bootlegging, kick him in the nuts.

460
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:04,200
Rym: Yeah, well, once again I point out that the RIA isn't actually winning any of their lawsuits.

461
00:25:04,823 --> 00:25:06,840
Scott: They haven't gotten a law passed in years either.

462
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:07,348
Rym: Yeah.

463
00:25:07,901 --> 00:25:12,019
Rym: I mean, you always hear about, oh, so-and-so was sued, so-and-so settled for some obscene amount of money.

464
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:18,379
Rym: They're settling because they don't wanna risk fighting it, but the people who fight tend to win.

465
00:25:19,341 --> 00:25:21,460
Scott: I don't think anyone's actually finished fighting it.

466
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,060
Rym: Yeah, the one woman, it was overturned, but now the RA is trying to get her again.

467
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:25,965
Scott: Yep.

468
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:26,880
Scott: Doesn't matter.

469
00:25:27,761 --> 00:25:31,340
Scott: All the bad news about the RIA is they're trying to do something evil.

470
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,840
Scott: The broadcast flag is coming.

471
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:33,277
Scott: Oh, no.

472
00:25:33,764 --> 00:25:34,540
Rym: You never hear news.

473
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:40,400
Scott: Nothing bad has actually happened except since the DMCA, which has been five years, six years.

474
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,040
Rym: And the DMCA hasn't really been tested in court yet either.

475
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:51,179
Scott: Yeah, we might still have a chance to eliminate it with another means besides the means we tried once, which is I think what bad means.

476
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:57,572
Rym: The thing is, they can't arrest us all, and I don't wanna sound, you know, everyone does it.

477
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,520
Rym: The vast majority of people who have computers pirate things in some scale.

478
00:26:01,921 --> 00:26:02,599
Scott: Would they know it or not?

479
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,900
Rym: You can't arrest everyone.

480
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,519
Rym: It's over.

481
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,094
Rym: Give up.

482
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,077
Rym: Buggy whips.

483
00:26:12,762 --> 00:26:16,820
Rym: So just before this, I watched I'm the Juggernaut, bitch again.

484
00:26:17,523 --> 00:26:17,898
Scott: It's great.

485
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,891
Rym: And Scott said something to the effect of.

486
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:20,939
Rym: that should be the thing of the day.

487
00:26:22,106 --> 00:26:22,538
Scott: It should be.

488
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:23,959
Rym: Which I said it already was.

489
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:24,680
Rym: That's fine.

490
00:26:25,342 --> 00:26:27,279
Rym: It'll be my thing of the day every day for the next week.

491
00:26:28,081 --> 00:26:33,920
Scott: If you haven't seen the Juggernaut, bitch, then go to frontrowcrew.com and there should be a link somewhere.

492
00:26:34,081 --> 00:26:35,080
Rym: I recommend watching it.

493
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,360
Rym: It's stupid, but it just builds up over time.

494
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,879
Scott: It just helps a little bit if you know who some of the X-Men are.

495
00:26:41,281 --> 00:26:44,200
Rym: Even though we have no idea who the frickin' mohawk guy at the end is.

496
00:26:44,544 --> 00:26:45,240
Scott: Not a clue.

497
00:26:45,641 --> 00:26:48,200
Scott: And we didn't know who the pimp cane guy was either until someone told us.

498
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,099
Scott: She was my pimp cane.

499
00:26:49,381 --> 00:26:50,079
Scott: You're my pimp cane.

500
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:57,519
Rym: Anyway, my thing of the day is- It has nothing to do with that.

501
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:58,783
Rym: It is-.

502
00:26:58,804 --> 00:27:00,220
Rym: now this is kind of well done.

503
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,339
Rym: I was fairly impressed with it.

504
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:06,380
Rym: It is Robocop versus Neo from The Matrix.

505
00:27:06,941 --> 00:27:07,539
Scott: I picked the winner.

506
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:08,740
Rym: Correctly.

507
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,100
Rym: Now the best part is- Who's gonna win?

508
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,919
Rym: The referee is Crocodile Dundee.

509
00:27:14,441 --> 00:27:15,339
Scott: He only seat once.

510
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:15,791
Rym: Yeah.

511
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:21,400
Rym: But to spoil it slightly, so Neo is fighting Robocop and he kicks Robocop's ass.

512
00:27:22,381 --> 00:27:26,453
Rym: Then that other thing from Robocop appears along with Yoda, okay?

513
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,540
Rym: And this is really well done.

514
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,148
Rym: Just watch it.

515
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:37,800
Rym: I don't know what else I can say other than the fact that- It is a fine piece of video editing work, I must say.

516
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,820
Scott: Not the greatest I've ever seen, but far from- it's definitely above the line.

517
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:48,459
Rym: It's in the same style and the same technique as that Cowboy Bebop anime music video that everyone knows.

518
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,896
Scott: It's a little better than that, I'd say, especially- Yeah, yeah.

519
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:51,230
Scott: Yeah.

520
00:27:52,081 --> 00:27:54,358
Rym: But the same kind of tricks, like how they did it.

521
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,939
Scott: Yep, definitely an entertaining watch.

522
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,240
Rym: All right, so Scott's got a thing of the day that is absolutely hilarious.

523
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:08,959
Scott: Have you ever seen The Ten Commandments with, you know, "From My Cold Dead Hands"?

524
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:10,239
Scott: What's his name?

525
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:10,798
Rym: Heston?

526
00:28:11,061 --> 00:28:11,231
Scott: Yes.

527
00:28:13,003 --> 00:28:15,539
Scott: The long movie they show on Passover every year.

528
00:28:16,201 --> 00:28:20,839
Scott: Which is actually a pretty good movie, even if, you know, the story is made up and just a Bible story.

529
00:28:21,781 --> 00:28:22,859
Scott: I actually liked the movie a whole lot.

530
00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:24,400
Rym: Yeah, it's a good movie.

531
00:28:24,723 --> 00:28:25,479
Scott: It's got Yul Brynner.

532
00:28:26,263 --> 00:28:26,900
Rym: He's the man.

533
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,660
Scott: Yul Brynner is the man, even though he's dead.

534
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,179
Rym: I mean, he's as much the man as Sean Connery.

535
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:32,738
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

536
00:28:33,341 --> 00:28:34,538
Scott: He was also the king in King and I.

537
00:28:35,566 --> 00:28:35,979
Rym: Oh, really?

538
00:28:36,261 --> 00:28:36,678
Scott: Yeah, really.

539
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:49,398
Scott: So, anyway, some guy took The Ten Commandments, and remember that shinning thing that was big where the guy took The Shining and he made a feel-good movie trailer out of shining footage?

540
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,800
Rym: Yeah, and they turned West Side Story into a zombie movie.

541
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:57,220
Scott: Well, this guy took The Ten Commandments and turned it into a teen movie.

542
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,019
Rym: Ten Things I Hate About Commandments.

543
00:28:59,700 --> 00:28:59,790
Scott: Yeah.

544
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:00,668
Scott: Yeah.

545
00:29:01,521 --> 00:29:01,625
Scott: So...

546
00:29:02,081 --> 00:29:03,380
Rym: Moses, Moses.

547
00:29:07,365 --> 00:29:09,377
Scott: You had to see this, especially...

548
00:29:10,001 --> 00:29:11,020
Rym: Samuel L. Jackson.

549
00:29:11,381 --> 00:29:13,780
Scott: Samuel L. Jackson is Principal Firebush.

550
00:29:15,685 --> 00:29:16,659
Rym: It's really well done.

551
00:29:17,225 --> 00:29:18,437
Scott: Burning bush, oh my god.

552
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,740
Rym: It is, once again, it shows the power of editing.

553
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:22,927
Scott: Yeah.

554
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:30,700
Scott: Like, if anyone... You go to see a movie and you pay attention to special effects and the plot and that stuff.

555
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:35,498
Scott: You don't pay attention to editing so much, but that's the goddamn, one of the most important things going on.

556
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,540
Rym: I mean, editing can make it break.

557
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:41,459
Scott: If you edit poorly, the editing makes the difference between a teen movie and a Ten Commandments.

558
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,820
Scott: That's a big buck difference.

559
00:29:44,065 --> 00:29:45,040
Scott: You better edit properly.

560
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:45,428
Rym: Yep.

561
00:29:46,381 --> 00:29:51,639
Scott: So a lot of people have been trying out Ubuntu lately on our forums and such.

562
00:29:53,140 --> 00:30:00,297
Scott: And we gotta remember, because we tend to say Ubuntu, even though the correct pronunciation is Ubuntu, so we're going to try to say Ubuntu.

563
00:30:02,203 --> 00:30:02,540
Rym: Ubuntu.

564
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:03,392
Scott: Ubuntu.

565
00:30:04,881 --> 00:30:07,140
Scott: It's some African word that means humanity to others.

566
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:08,579
Scott: It's on the front page of the site.

567
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:09,800
Scott: Yeah.

568
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,500
Scott: But anyway, today we're kind of copping out because we're tired.

569
00:30:12,881 --> 00:30:14,640
Rym: And luckily we went long in the first half of the show.

570
00:30:14,928 --> 00:30:15,340
Scott: On purpose.

571
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,834
Rym: But basically, everyone always says "Oh, how should I get into

572
00:30:18,854 --> 00:30:19,095
Rym: Linux?"

573
00:30:19,135 --> 00:30:20,100
Rym: or "How do I use

574
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,525
Rym: Ubuntu?"

575
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:21,334
Rym: or "How do I start

576
00:30:21,395 --> 00:30:21,435
Rym: it?".

577
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:26,860
Rym: So we're going to go into great detail into exactly what you need to do to use Ubuntu.

578
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:32,440
Scott: Yeah, we're gonna assume that you have, well no, we can do Mac or Windows, it doesn't matter.

579
00:30:34,721 --> 00:30:41,278
Scott: We're going to tell you everything you need to do to try out Ubuntu Linux and install it if you really want to.

580
00:30:42,241 --> 00:30:51,578
Scott: It's brain dead simple, and I'm going to make this hopefully so uncomplicated that anyone who knows how to click a mouse and type on a keyboard can do it.

581
00:30:53,163 --> 00:30:54,879
Scott: So, step one.

582
00:30:55,881 --> 00:30:57,519
Scott: Look at what kind of computer you have.

583
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,139
Rym: It's either a Mac or not a Mac.

584
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,887
Scott: Well, it could be if it's an Intel Mac.

585
00:31:04,108 --> 00:31:08,380
Scott: that's different from if it's a G5 Mac or a G4 Mac.

586
00:31:08,906 --> 00:31:09,480
Scott: That's important.

587
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:13,380
Scott: Basically, there are three categories.

588
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,280
Scott: There is PC or Intel Mac.

589
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,613
Scott: Those are x86.

590
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:26,720
Scott: There is a PowerPC, which is a Mac, a G3, a G4, a G5, a PowerBook, or an iBook.

591
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,454
Scott: A MacBook is an x86.

592
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,119
Scott: A PowerBook is a PowerPC.

593
00:31:34,482 --> 00:31:39,152
Scott: Then, there's, if you have an AMD 64 or a Pentium Xeon 64 or one of those, a 64-something.

594
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,940
Scott: That's the third category.

595
00:31:45,264 --> 00:31:46,479
Scott: That's the first thing you have to know.

596
00:31:46,981 --> 00:31:49,400
Scott: So figure out which of those three categories you're in.

597
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:53,000
Scott: Normal PC or Intel MacBook, those are one category.

598
00:31:54,001 --> 00:31:57,659
Scott: Normal Mac or old school pre-Intel Mac, that's category two.

599
00:31:58,301 --> 00:32:00,019
Scott: And 64-bit is category three.

600
00:32:00,883 --> 00:32:05,593
Rym: Now, all you have to do, once you know that, is go to the Ubuntu site and download whichever one it is.

601
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,265
Scott: You go to ubuntu.com.

602
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:13,360
Scott: On the right side, there'll be a link that says Download Now.

603
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,354
Scott: You click on it.

604
00:32:15,081 --> 00:32:19,640
Scott: Then you click on one of the links that has the name of your locale.

605
00:32:20,561 --> 00:32:25,800
Scott: So Germany, France, Canada, there's like eight for the United States.

606
00:32:25,923 --> 00:32:26,637
Scott: Just pick one.

607
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:27,876
Scott: Click on it.

608
00:32:29,102 --> 00:32:32,840
Scott: That will bring you to a site that has a list of downloads.

609
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:38,640
Scott: Now, there are two CDs, the Live CD and the Install CD.

610
00:32:39,901 --> 00:32:48,260
Scott: Get, I recommend, if you've never used Ubuntu or Linux before, to get the Live CD of your appropriate architecture.

611
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:55,360
Scott: So I have a PC that runs Windows, so I would get the PC Intel x86 Live CD.

612
00:32:56,441 --> 00:33:00,960
Scott: You click on it, and you download this ISO file to your computer.

613
00:33:02,344 --> 00:33:05,100
Rym: Now, ISOs are just a list of bits, basically.

614
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,420
Rym: Don't try to open them or extract them or anything.

615
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:12,059
Rym: Just use whatever program you have that'll burn ISOs and burn it straight to a CD.

616
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:18,020
Scott: An ISO is basically a perfect image of a CD-ROM put into a file.

617
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:23,340
Scott: So you use a program like Nero or ISO burn, whatever it's called.

618
00:33:23,661 --> 00:33:29,315
Scott: There's a lot of programs out there that let you take an ISO file and put it directly to a CD.

619
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:34,180
Rym: If you use Windows, the best one, I forget the name offhand, but I use it on all my Windows PCs.

620
00:33:35,121 --> 00:33:36,700
Rym: Someone talked about it in the forums.

621
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,560
Rym: It uses the built-into Windows ISO recording that, for some reason, they never enabled.

622
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,720
Scott: Because that way, third-party software vendors aren't competing with Windows.

623
00:33:47,261 --> 00:33:50,558
Rym: And you can enable it, and then you can just right-click on an ISO and say "Burn to

624
00:33:50,578 --> 00:33:50,738
Rym: CD.".

625
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:51,459
Scott: Yep.

626
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:56,179
Scott: So take the ISO file of this live CD and burn it to the CD.

627
00:33:57,121 --> 00:33:58,319
Scott: Now blank CD-R.

628
00:33:58,724 --> 00:33:59,660
Rym: Now change your BIOS.

629
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:06,657
Scott: Okay, now reboot your computer, and when it says press whatever to enter setup, configuration, whatever.

630
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,837
Rym: Most newer computers tend to be F1.

631
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:10,760
Rym: Older ones sometimes are delete.

632
00:34:11,542 --> 00:34:12,679
Scott: Delete, F4, who knows?

633
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,438
Scott: Push whatever key it tells you to push.

634
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:15,340
Rym: Uh, trivia.

635
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:26,820
Rym: In DOS, back in the DOS days, if you held F5 during the DOS boot, DOS boots, it would not load any drivers and dump you into the barest barebones DOS you could get.

636
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,838
Rym: If you held down F8, it would go through every item in your booting process and ask you if you wanted to do it or not.

637
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:35,768
Scott: Mm-hmm.

638
00:34:36,301 --> 00:34:37,059
Scott: Those are good days.

639
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:38,279
Rym: Ah, good days.

640
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,059
Scott: Okay, so, do this.

641
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:51,172
Scott: There should be somewhere, navigate the menus, and look through all of them, and somewhere it should talk about the first boot device, the second boot device, the third boot device, etc.

642
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:59,080
Scott: Make sure that CD-ROM is the first boot device, and hard drive is the second boot device.

643
00:35:00,461 --> 00:35:02,560
Rym: Well, it doesn't really matter as long as CD-ROM is number one.

644
00:35:03,021 --> 00:35:04,800
Scott: Yeah, make sure CD-ROM is number one.

645
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:10,500
Scott: If you have a floppy drive, you should probably make floppy number one, CD number two, but no one has floppy drives anymore.

646
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:18,960
Scott: Some computers, newer ones actually, have an option where when the computer starts up, it'll say press F something for boot menu.

647
00:35:19,723 --> 00:35:20,319
Scott: That's good.

648
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,220
Scott: My parents, or boot options, my parents' computer has that.

649
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:27,559
Scott: You just push F10, and then you choose the boot device for right now.

650
00:35:28,261 --> 00:35:31,660
Scott: So if you have that option, do that and just select CD-ROM.

651
00:35:33,302 --> 00:35:36,780
Scott: You didn't take the CD out after you burned it, so just leave it in there, the live CD.

652
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,699
Scott: Leave it in the computer.

653
00:35:38,842 --> 00:35:43,480
Scott: So, you boot off of the CD-ROM after you change the settings in your BIOS.

654
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,980
Scott: Ubuntu will start with this screen.

655
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,315
Scott: Ubuntu.

656
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:53,136
Scott: We'll start, and you'll see this screen that says "ubuntu boot

657
00:35:53,177 --> 00:35:53,518
Scott: colon.".

658
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,259
Scott: Push enter at that screen.

659
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:59,700
Rym: Uh, if you have weird or old or crappy hardware, you might have to type stuff there.

660
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:00,658
Scott: That's true.

661
00:36:01,703 --> 00:36:18,691
Scott: If you're using a really old, shitty computer, or a weird laptop, or maybe you have something really crazy going on in your computer like SCSI drives will sometimes cause trouble because he drives anything really weird but maybe like a PCMCA hard drive or network card weird stuff.

662
00:36:19,153 --> 00:36:23,130
Scott: what you want to do is I think they tell you to push some key for more options.

663
00:36:23,592 --> 00:36:39,758
Scott: then you can read through the options and you want to do stuff like no FB which means no frame buffer or change the resolution to something lower in case you have a real shitty old monitor and stuff like that and all you do to do that is type the commands.

664
00:36:39,818 --> 00:36:41,988
Scott: the menu tells you to type at that same place.

665
00:36:42,028 --> 00:36:43,133
Scott: I just told you to push enter.

666
00:36:44,459 --> 00:36:46,325
Scott: once you're beyond that you just wait.

667
00:36:47,389 --> 00:37:04,890
Scott: what will happen is Ubuntu will boot and will be fully usable 100% and that will basically let you use Ubuntu and test it out for as long as you want to do for as long as you want without having to write any data to your hard drive whatsoever.

668
00:37:05,132 --> 00:37:05,433
Scott: you're not.

669
00:37:05,494 --> 00:37:06,359
Scott: you didn't install it.

670
00:37:06,439 --> 00:37:08,992
Scott: you're just running it using the RAM and the CD ROM.

671
00:37:09,032 --> 00:37:16,317
Scott: your hard drive isn't even on at this point and this lets you see if Ubuntu is the right thing for you.

672
00:37:16,337 --> 00:37:22,543
Rym: now if you like it and you want to install it you boot the install CD instead of the live CD.

673
00:37:22,643 --> 00:37:24,309
Scott: yep repeat the same process.

674
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:28,728
Scott: we just said only use the install CD instead of the live CD.

675
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,315
Rym: now you have to pick.

676
00:37:30,335 --> 00:37:32,666
Rym: you know where you want it to install at all and you can.

677
00:37:32,908 --> 00:37:36,729
Rym: you can keep your windows drives around and all that depending on what kind of thing you want to set up.

678
00:37:37,533 --> 00:37:41,153
Scott: yes I'm not going to give a big lecture about drive partitioning.

679
00:37:41,173 --> 00:37:42,219
Rym: you're on your own for that point.

680
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:43,729
Rym: we're gonna go with your bit.

681
00:37:43,769 --> 00:37:45,942
Rym: you're just wiping out a computer and building it from scratch.

682
00:37:46,143 --> 00:37:53,640
Scott: yes we're going to assume that you have a blank hard drive and you're going to erase it now if you already have windows on there somewhere.

683
00:37:54,222 --> 00:38:07,866
Scott: you need some free space not empty space on the windows drive unpartitioned space and that's not the same thing but you can get a lesson about that online and I'm not going to teach it to you.

684
00:38:08,309 --> 00:38:09,679
Rym: so we're assuming you just don't care.

685
00:38:09,799 --> 00:38:12,111
Rym: and you boot the install CD and you hit enter.

686
00:38:12,372 --> 00:38:13,899
Scott: yep you boot the install CD.

687
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,522
Scott: you hit enter.

688
00:38:15,325 --> 00:38:18,177
Scott: all you have to do now is hit enter a bunch more times.

689
00:38:18,257 --> 00:38:20,830
Scott: now it's going to ask you a few questions along the way.

690
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,539
Scott: it's going to ask you for a root pad.

691
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:23,785
Scott: no one ask you for a root password.

692
00:38:23,805 --> 00:38:25,352
Scott: I asked you to create a user account.

693
00:38:26,497 --> 00:38:35,293
Scott: it'll ask you possibly for some network configurations which should be pretty obvious you know automatically configure the network and whatnot.

694
00:38:36,638 --> 00:38:39,248
Scott: it'll ask you where you want to install Ubuntu.

695
00:38:39,289 --> 00:38:45,136
Scott: you just select that you select a hard drive and then you'll say yeah they'll completely delete that drive.

696
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:54,095
Scott: or you select some empty space and say use that empty space and Ubuntu will can recommend partitions for you or you can automatically partition.

697
00:38:54,938 --> 00:38:57,288
Scott: I recommend letting Ubuntu pick partitions.

698
00:38:57,569 --> 00:38:58,292
Scott: it's really smart.

699
00:38:58,995 --> 00:38:59,657
Scott: it knows what to do.

700
00:38:59,959 --> 00:39:06,347
Rym: yeah if you know why you want certain partitions to be certain ways you don't need to be listening to our advice right now.

701
00:39:06,528 --> 00:39:16,918
Rym: yeah this is for people who know nothing about Linux and I mean if you know that you want var log to be a separate partition in case the logs fill up because your rotators whatever then yeah go away.

702
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:19,226
Rym: no don't go away but stop listening today.

703
00:39:19,246 --> 00:39:21,954
Scott: yeah all right.

704
00:39:22,035 --> 00:39:27,700
Scott: so what this will do is you'll push enter a bunch of times and eventually Ubuntu will be installed.

705
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:31,052
Scott: Ubuntu will be now reboot.

706
00:39:31,313 --> 00:39:35,849
Scott: you'll take the CD out and reboot the computer and it'll be just like the live CD.

707
00:39:36,029 --> 00:39:40,129
Scott: only now it's on your hard drive that you have Ubuntu completely installed and working.

708
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:40,712
Rym: that's it.

709
00:39:40,933 --> 00:39:42,140
Rym: the only you've got it.

710
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,980
Rym: the only other thing I would recommend doing is there's a thing called easy Ubuntu.

711
00:39:46,241 --> 00:39:48,267
Scott: right here's how to do easy Ubuntu.

712
00:39:48,308 --> 00:39:50,455
Scott: this is see Ubuntu by itself.

713
00:39:50,475 --> 00:39:51,077
Scott: Ubuntu.

714
00:39:51,157 --> 00:40:04,276
Scott: Ubuntu by itself follows a bunch of laws that are evil and sucky and these laws make it hard for you to watch videos or use flash or Java.

715
00:40:04,637 --> 00:40:14,775
Scott: Java is the worst one yeah and all sorts of Nvidia driver that you'll need if you have an Nvidia card the official ATI driver so that your 3d will work properly.

716
00:40:14,895 --> 00:40:20,577
Scott: all that stuff is not in Ubuntu for legal reasons so you need to get those things.

717
00:40:20,637 --> 00:40:25,696
Scott: the easiest way to get those things is with a separate program called easy Ubuntu.

718
00:40:26,078 --> 00:40:31,618
Rym: all it is is a script that will very easily do all those hard things for you.

719
00:40:31,678 --> 00:40:34,232
Rym: it'll get Java and install it'll get flash and install.

720
00:40:34,252 --> 00:40:36,142
Rym: it'll do all the stuff you need to make everything work.

721
00:40:36,343 --> 00:40:44,975
Scott: yeah so go to easy Ubuntu dot free contrib org or just Google for it or Google for easy Ubuntu and go.

722
00:40:45,015 --> 00:40:48,788
Scott: you'll see a link at the top of that site that will say get easy Ubuntu.

723
00:40:49,491 --> 00:40:49,772
Scott: now.

724
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:56,197
Scott: there are three ways to get easy Ubuntu the beta release the bleeding edge and the nightly snapshot.

725
00:40:56,498 --> 00:40:58,728
Scott: get the beta release now.

726
00:40:58,849 --> 00:40:59,672
Scott: it's a little tricky.

727
00:40:59,753 --> 00:41:08,603
Scott: what you have to do is you to open a terminal because there isn't really a terminal in Ubuntu that you can get to easily press.

728
00:41:09,265 --> 00:41:12,614
Scott: remember these keys control alt f1 all at the same time.

729
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:19,860
Scott: now type in your username and then your password and then type in the commands that ease.

730
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,471
Scott: the easy Ubuntu website told you to type in.

731
00:41:22,712 --> 00:41:23,937
Rym: just follow their instructions.

732
00:41:24,419 --> 00:41:26,795
Scott: oh no actually you can't type those in a control at f1.

733
00:41:26,815 --> 00:41:29,249
Scott: you'd have to type them in X because it tries to open that thing.

734
00:41:29,269 --> 00:41:31,078
Rym: all right open a terminal.

735
00:41:31,138 --> 00:41:31,781
Rym: you can do that.

736
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:36,980
Scott: yeah has see how would you open a terminal in Ubuntu if it doesn't tell you?

737
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:44,123
Scott: I guess you have to right click on the gnome panel and add the command line to the panel.

738
00:41:44,686 --> 00:41:50,531
Rym: actually I think in known by default if you right-click one of the context no because they take that one out in Ubuntu.

739
00:41:50,692 --> 00:41:50,994
Scott: what?

740
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:56,584
Scott: yeah they take that out in Ubuntu to make it easier but it also makes it difficult to get people open a terminal.

741
00:41:56,665 --> 00:41:57,409
Scott: that's the problem.

742
00:41:58,012 --> 00:41:59,279
Rym: see I've never actually used a bunch of.

743
00:41:59,299 --> 00:42:00,365
Rym: I'm just taking with gen 2.

744
00:42:00,365 --> 00:42:04,894
Scott: yeah if you right click on the desktop in Ubuntu it doesn't give you the option to open terminal.

745
00:42:04,914 --> 00:42:05,297
Scott: all right.

746
00:42:05,317 --> 00:42:06,282
Rym: then how do you open a terminal?

747
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:16,765
Scott: I guess you have to right click on the big gray bar across the top in one of the in the open space and say add to panel and then add the command line to the panel.

748
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:20,502
Scott: this is the easiest way and this white box will appear in the panel.

749
00:42:20,742 --> 00:42:25,721
Scott: in that white box type XT ERM and press enter and a terminal will open up.

750
00:42:26,884 --> 00:42:32,363
Scott: then type the four commands you see on the easy Ubuntu website and after that you're done.

751
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,349
Rym: you've got a bunch of working.

752
00:42:33,731 --> 00:42:35,945
Scott: well this box will open up with some checkbox.

753
00:42:35,965 --> 00:42:37,979
Rym: yeah you have to answer questions to say what you wanted.

754
00:42:38,019 --> 00:42:44,493
Scott: yeah you just check the boxes of the stuff that you want to add to Ubuntu and click OK and now you have a perfect amazing Ubuntu.

755
00:42:44,734 --> 00:42:45,116
Rym: that's it.

756
00:42:45,216 --> 00:42:48,672
Rym: if you want more software than it comes with open the package manager.

757
00:42:48,692 --> 00:43:07,651
Scott: yeah if you go to system administration synaptic package manager you can go in there and search for programs that you want to add to Ubuntu and install them just by checking the boxes and clicking install and you should really shouldn't get software from anywhere else besides the package manager.

758
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:14,562
Scott: yeah don't try to install like dabs or just yeah don't go around the internet looking for software trying to install it.

759
00:43:14,602 --> 00:43:33,390
Scott: if you need more software that isn't included in Ubuntu it either a doesn't exist or B you should get it from the package manager or C. it'll be in the next version of Ubuntu which is coming soon and if you need anything beyond that just use gen 2 or go on the internets or make a Linux from scratch or search for something on the internet.

760
00:43:33,431 --> 00:43:34,234
Scott: is that to ask?

761
00:43:34,315 --> 00:43:35,118
Scott: how do I do this?

762
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:35,921
Scott: how do I do that?

763
00:43:36,142 --> 00:43:41,566
Rym: yep but I mean all in all the rooms is really really simple to use and it's really really good.

764
00:43:41,586 --> 00:43:43,737
Scott: I think I said this in the forum as well.

765
00:43:43,778 --> 00:43:45,987
Scott: say it again here back in the day.

766
00:43:46,268 --> 00:43:52,651
Scott: there the law of Linux was that if the Linux distribution was easy to use it sucked quality wise.

767
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:59,743
Scott: I mean Red Hat was easy to install and Mandrake was a little less easy to install and Mandrake was a little bit better than Red Hat.

768
00:44:00,286 --> 00:44:06,677
Scott: but they both really sucked because as a consequence of making it really easy they screwed it all up.

769
00:44:07,602 --> 00:44:16,142
Scott: Gentoo and Debian were really hard to install and you had to work to maintain them and to a certain extent you still do even though it's a little bit easier nowadays.

770
00:44:17,247 --> 00:44:19,496
Scott: but they were infinitely superior.

771
00:44:19,516 --> 00:44:20,038
Scott: they were real.

772
00:44:20,078 --> 00:44:20,941
Scott: they were real Linux.

773
00:44:21,002 --> 00:44:25,116
Scott: they work the way Ubuntu works now quality ways.

774
00:44:25,437 --> 00:44:26,280
Scott: they didn't crash.

775
00:44:26,481 --> 00:44:27,446
Scott: everything worked.

776
00:44:27,526 --> 00:44:34,685
Scott: everything was beautiful you know and a lot of people got bad impressions of Linux because they we didn't want to put the effort in to do the hard Linux.

777
00:44:34,746 --> 00:44:35,872
Scott: is that worked properly?

778
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:41,299
Scott: or they did the hard Linux is wrong and they worked improperly or they did the easy Linux isn't they sucked?

779
00:44:42,142 --> 00:44:45,698
Scott: Ubuntu is so amazing because it is the easy Linux that doesn't suck.

780
00:44:45,999 --> 00:44:50,460
Scott: it's essentially just as good as the real deal Debian when you get right down to it.

781
00:44:52,045 --> 00:45:00,035
Scott: so if you've never used Linux before Ubuntu is a good way to start and if you but you the problem is you won't learn anything about Linux.

782
00:45:00,055 --> 00:45:04,040
Scott: you'll just have Linux to be able to use which if you don't care about computers that's fine.

783
00:45:04,161 --> 00:45:08,628
Scott: yeah if you don't care about computers and you don't want to learn anything about Linux just stick with Ubuntu.

784
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:10,455
Scott: it's easy it's shiny it works.

785
00:45:10,817 --> 00:45:13,607
Scott: it's also free super everything in Linux is free.

786
00:45:14,993 --> 00:45:21,479
Scott: but if you want to learn something about Linux and be the Linux God you should try Gentoo or Debian or something.

787
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:22,686
Scott: yeah Linux from scratch.

788
00:45:22,726 --> 00:45:24,417
Scott: yeah Gentoo is probably the best way.

789
00:45:24,457 --> 00:45:27,936
Scott: they give you this handbook and you just read the handbook and follow the directions.

790
00:45:27,996 --> 00:45:35,773
Scott: now following the directions won't learn you anything unless you remember that you need to figure out and make sure you know what you're doing.

791
00:45:36,034 --> 00:45:39,715
Rym: while you read the handbook I mean like it'll say type blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

792
00:45:40,298 --> 00:45:43,216
Rym: you'll type exactly what they type but make sure you know why you're typing it.

793
00:45:43,377 --> 00:45:48,204
Scott: yeah make sure you know exactly what the commands you're typing are doing if you use the Gentoo handbook.

794
00:45:48,224 --> 00:45:50,154
Scott: that's the only way to learn what's going on.

795
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,343
Scott: the first like two or three times I did it.

796
00:45:53,025 --> 00:46:04,710
Scott: I didn't know what half the commands meant but I just didn't work cuz I didn't know what I was doing until I learned what each and everything really was and then I had it down.

797
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:07,886
Scott: now I'm the Gentoo install master even though I'm out of practice.

798
00:46:07,926 --> 00:46:09,133
Scott: I haven't done it in a couple years now.

799
00:46:09,777 --> 00:46:14,380
Rym: on that note we did this episode mostly because it's a cop-out so we can go to bed.

800
00:46:14,681 --> 00:46:15,662
Scott: whoo cop out.

801
00:46:16,003 --> 00:46:17,746
Rym: so good night yay.

802
00:46:24,997 --> 00:46:27,100
Rym: and that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

803
00:46:27,361 --> 00:46:29,793
Rym: special thanks to DJ pretzel for our opening theme.

804
00:46:30,195 --> 00:46:34,591
Scott: be sure to visit our website at www.frontrowcrew.com.

805
00:46:35,233 --> 00:46:37,580
Scott: if you like our podcast you'll love our forums.

806
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:38,525
Scott: make sure you visit them.

807
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:45,169
Scott: you can send your email feedback to GeekNights at gmail.com and if you want you can leave us a voicemail at 206-333-1537.

808
00:46:49,882 --> 00:46:52,715
Rym: GeekNights airs every weeknight Monday through Thursday.

809
00:46:53,318 --> 00:47:00,420
Scott: GeekNights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience but unlike those other talk shows it's actually recorded at night.
