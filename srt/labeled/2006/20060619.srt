1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,509
Scott: It's Monday, June 19th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,760
Scott: Tonight, we discuss switching to Mac and GarageBand.

3
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,058
Scott: Let's do this!

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,260
Rym: Well, we're back from yet another con weekend.

5
00:00:23,301 --> 00:00:25,919
Scott: Oh, and what a one-day con it was, at least for us.

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,100
Rym: Yeah, it was weird though, going to a con where we're not staff, or we're not panelists, or we were nothing special.

7
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,159
Rym: We were just a bunch of guys.

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,660
Scott: Yeah, it's like I could tell that it was a good con, and there was lots of happening stuff.

9
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:40,980
Scott: Not maybe what I expected to be happening, but good stuff.

10
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:47,557
Scott: But for us personally, you know, since we didn't know anyone there, it was kind of weird at times, you know, trying to look for something to do.

11
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:56,940
Rym: Yeah, I mean usually when I go to a con, I'm either like hanging around being security, I'm hanging around with my giant crew making fun of punk kids or something, but here it was just us and Katsu.

12
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,500
Scott: Yeah, well, we'll talk about that more on Wednesday.

13
00:00:59,841 --> 00:01:00,957
Rym: Yeah, when we actually cover it.

14
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:01,922
Scott: Yep.

15
00:01:01,943 --> 00:01:11,939
Scott: Well, we know this is a lot of new listeners, so all this week we're gonna do like a 30-second little tiny bit at the beginning of the show to help all the new listeners out.

16
00:01:12,365 --> 00:01:13,080
Scott: Hello, new listeners.

17
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,300
Rym: We figure most of you are from all the conventions we've been to lately.

18
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,766
Rym: Yeah, at least that's our guess.

19
00:01:17,806 --> 00:01:20,039
Rym: If anyone's here for some other weird reason, let us know.

20
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,564
Scott: Yeah, let us know how you got here.

21
00:01:21,785 --> 00:01:24,815
Scott: Well, first off, I'm Scott, and I'm Rym.

22
00:01:25,096 --> 00:01:26,240
Scott: So don't get confused.

23
00:01:27,107 --> 00:01:27,578
Scott: Who is who?

24
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:36,318
Rym: Yeah, we had a listener once who was like, "Eh, Rym, stop being so mean to Scott," which was kind of weird because usually it's the Eh, it goes both ways.

25
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:42,472
Scott: Second of all, we do four shows a week.

26
00:01:42,552 --> 00:01:43,995
Scott: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

27
00:01:44,296 --> 00:01:45,739
Scott: Monday is science and technology.

28
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:46,260
Scott: That's today.

29
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,108
Scott: Tuesday night is games of all sorts.

30
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,340
Scott: Wednesday is anime, manga, and comics, and Thursday is crazy.

31
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,660
Rym: Yeah, usually us yelling about things, ranting about things, raving sometimes.

32
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:06,352
Scott: Yep, so if you were downloading the show manually and are not yet into the hip, cool podcasting subscription scene, we have five different feeds.

33
00:02:06,573 --> 00:02:15,240
Scott: One feed will get you every single episode we do, and there are separate feeds for each day, you know, because a lot of people only want to listen to Tuesday or only want to listen to Thursday.

34
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,140
Rym: Yeah, your best bet is either to look for them whatever pod catching thing you use or podcast directory or just go to our website.

35
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:21,700
Rym: They're all listed.

36
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:28,539
Scott: Yeah, I'm not going to give you a tutorial on how to do this because you can just search on Google for podcasting how-tos, and it will tell you everything you need to know.

37
00:02:29,242 --> 00:02:30,666
Scott: iTunes is probably the easiest way.

38
00:02:31,088 --> 00:02:34,880
Rym: And of course if you go to the website, we have forums, we have a frapper map.

39
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:45,229
Scott: Yep, so go to www.frontrowcrew.com and all our cool stuffs are there for you to do.

40
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,656
Rym: Also our archive of, I don't know, 130 episodes or so.

41
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,174
Scott: Something crazy like that.

42
00:02:50,397 --> 00:02:50,620
Scott: Yeah.

43
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:57,800
Scott: Yeah, but make sure especially the forums and email us geeknights@frontrowcrew.com and for feedback.

44
00:02:58,581 --> 00:03:07,554
Scott: So that, you know, you can tell us stuff and then we might talk about it on the show or... I responded to like almost every email we get because we don't get too many yet.

45
00:03:08,237 --> 00:03:17,528
Rym: And speaking of feedback, let us know how the audio sounds, especially today and in the coming few days, because for those of you who do frequent the forums, I bought on Mac Mini.

46
00:03:17,991 --> 00:03:19,760
Scott: And that's what we're gonna talk about today, so hold on.

47
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:29,717
Rym: Yep, but I'll say right now that we're currently using GarageBand for the first time to record a podcast as opposed to our previous Linux box running ReSound, Audacity, Lame, and ID3v2.

48
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,201
Scott: Mm-hmm.

49
00:03:31,824 --> 00:03:33,248
Rym: And I have a lot to say about that.

50
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:34,954
Scott: Well, we'll say that all soon.

51
00:03:34,974 --> 00:03:35,054
Scott: Yep.

52
00:03:35,074 --> 00:03:35,796
Rym: First, let's...

53
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:42,120
Scott: I want to talk about something that happened recently in the forum that not everyone might be aware of.

54
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,069
Rym: Yeah, which I find this kind of hilarious.

55
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:45,195
Scott: I find it also hilarious.

56
00:03:45,577 --> 00:03:47,964
Scott: So apparently, let's start at the beginning.

57
00:03:47,984 --> 00:03:53,189
Scott: There's a guy named Thade who has a podcast that I was on once and he's in our forum and he likes our show.

58
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,260
Scott: His show's okay.

59
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:55,098
Scott: Haha.

60
00:03:57,272 --> 00:03:57,460
Scott: Lol.

61
00:03:59,162 --> 00:03:59,305
Rym: Elmo.

62
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,000
Scott: Yeah, Elmo.

63
00:04:01,521 --> 00:04:07,497
Scott: And he posted a thing in our forum saying, "This other podcast is number one on Libsyn and you're better than them.

64
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:07,778
Scott: What the

65
00:04:07,818 --> 00:04:08,119
Scott: hell?".

66
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:13,339
Rym: Now, part of that is that we've, until just now, never advertised GeekNights.

67
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:13,640
Rym: Never.

68
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:22,827
Rym: We've spread only through word-of-mouth and we've, basically, we're gearing up over these next many weeks toward Otakon, which is our, I guess, big coming out.

69
00:04:22,907 --> 00:04:27,420
Rym: That's gonna be our huge, crazy, live show in Baltimore, Maryland at the biggest anime con.

70
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,959
Scott: We're gonna do some real big promotion real soon.

71
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,570
Scott: So we're gonna, hopefully, a crap ton of listeners coming in.

72
00:04:32,811 --> 00:04:34,618
Rym: Even though we see you all kind of trickling in now.

73
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:35,080
Scott: Yep.

74
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:36,900
Scott: So that means it must be working.

75
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,718
Rym: But anyway, a lot of our current listeners are always yelling at us to get more listeners or "Why don't you

76
00:04:42,858 --> 00:04:43,460
Rym: advertise?"

77
00:04:43,621 --> 00:04:45,370
Rym: and "How come people don't talk about you

78
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:45,913
Rym: everywhere?".

79
00:04:45,933 --> 00:04:47,300
Rym: I wonder.

80
00:04:48,461 --> 00:04:57,927
Scott: But the point is that that other podcast is called The Moon Masters, which I listened to one episode, well, part of an episode, and it's just two guys talking about nothing.

81
00:04:58,207 --> 00:05:00,816
Scott: Like, we're two guys talking about stuff, geeky stuff.

82
00:05:00,856 --> 00:05:02,160
Scott: They're two guys talking about nothing.

83
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,729
Rym: So it's about the Seinfeld of podcasting?

84
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:04,394
Scott: I guess.

85
00:05:04,796 --> 00:05:05,340
Scott: I don't even know.

86
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,187
Rym: I haven't listened to it.

87
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:07,520
Rym: I have no opinion either way.

88
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,873
Scott: Yep, and basically, they got to number one on Libsyn by cheating, and they freely admit this.

89
00:05:12,953 --> 00:05:15,560
Scott: They did some sort of Fark image thing.

90
00:05:15,761 --> 00:05:16,786
Rym: It's a good way to cheat.

91
00:05:16,987 --> 00:05:17,912
Rym: I really give them props.

92
00:05:17,952 --> 00:05:19,520
Rym: I looked at what they did, and that was clever.

93
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,880
Scott: Yep, and Libsyn found out and stopped them, and whatever.

94
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,913
Scott: So, first of all, they didn't even beat us on, well, they might.

95
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:28,360
Scott: We have no idea where we are on Libsyn.

96
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:31,800
Scott: We're probably way down low because we don't use all that Libsyn stuff.

97
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:38,360
Rym: Yeah, Libsyn's always yelling at me to "Hey, update your RSS blah blah blah," but we don't use any of their features except their file storage.

98
00:05:38,682 --> 00:05:39,380
Scott: Yep, yep.

99
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:40,299
Rym: And we never plan to.

100
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,323
Scott: No, we don't.

101
00:05:43,545 --> 00:05:53,280
Scott: So, apparently, someone on our forum was on their forum also, and pointed to the thing where the Fade guy said that we were better.

102
00:05:53,641 --> 00:05:54,700
Rym: And then their forum exploded.

103
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,248
Scott: And their forum exploded a little.

104
00:05:56,368 --> 00:05:57,314
Scott: It wasn't a big explosion.

105
00:05:57,334 --> 00:05:58,360
Scott: It was a little tiny explosion.

106
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,620
Rym: It was a podcastosphere explosion.

107
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,029
Scott: Yeah, and then I went over there, and I was like, "I never listened to your

108
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:04,350
Scott: show.".

109
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:09,905
Scott: Well, I listen to it now, but at the time, I hadn't listened to the show, and I'm like, "We don't necessarily hate you,

110
00:06:10,146 --> 00:06:10,587
Scott: whatever.".

111
00:06:10,908 --> 00:06:12,773
Scott: Then they're like, "Yeah, we

112
00:06:12,813 --> 00:06:13,174
Scott: suck.".

113
00:06:13,395 --> 00:06:15,140
Scott: So they admitted that their podcast sucks.

114
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:17,548
Scott: And then they were like, "We should have a

115
00:06:17,609 --> 00:06:17,930
Scott: war.".

116
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,498
Scott: I'm like, "All

117
00:06:19,538 --> 00:06:19,698
Scott: right.".

118
00:06:20,141 --> 00:06:21,913
Rym: I guess we'll fire an opening, Salvo.

119
00:06:22,235 --> 00:06:22,819
Rym: You suck!

120
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,892
Scott: The Moon Masters is the worst podcast this side of the universe.

121
00:06:26,952 --> 00:06:29,200
Scott: It's two schmucks with bad audio quality.

122
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:29,922
Rym: I heard.

123
00:06:29,943 --> 00:06:32,214
Rym: I can't say where I heard this.

124
00:06:32,395 --> 00:06:37,620
Rym: It might just be a rumor, but I heard that the two Moon Masters can't get it up.

125
00:06:39,164 --> 00:06:40,640
Rym: And that they killed their parents.

126
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:41,860
Scott: Yeah.

127
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,720
Scott: I heard that since they live on the West Coast, everything is smaller over there.

128
00:06:49,222 --> 00:06:51,940
Rym: Okay, I feel like shock chalk radio right now.

129
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,544
Scott: Awesome.

130
00:06:53,148 --> 00:06:54,700
Scott: Let's do some news action.

131
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:55,481
Rym: Yeah.

132
00:06:55,541 --> 00:07:06,900
Rym: All right, so actually, we've been talking not really as news, but just as asides very often about HD DVD and Blu-ray, and anyone who's listened for a while knows our opinions on those two bits of technology.

133
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:16,019
Rym: But very recently, Blu-ray finally debuted in the point that now there are players available, and people have watched Blu-ray movies.

134
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:16,859
Scott: Holy crap.

135
00:07:17,681 --> 00:07:20,820
Rym: And the general response was underwhelming.

136
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,900
Scott: Well, the response to HD DVD was, "Hey, they basically gave me a Linux computer.

137
00:07:27,402 --> 00:07:29,711
Scott: It has a DVD-ROM which plays these things.

138
00:07:30,152 --> 00:07:34,374
Scott: It takes forever to start up and forever to load, but once it does, you get a really good-looking

139
00:07:34,394 --> 00:07:34,656
Scott: movie.".

140
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,736
Scott: So what is the Blu-ray response?

141
00:07:36,837 --> 00:07:37,100
Scott: Similar?

142
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:39,468
Rym: It really, really depended.

143
00:07:39,508 --> 00:07:45,760
Rym: I mean, there were a lot of the reviewers saying things like, "There was a lot of artifacting if you zoomed in or looked at some of the movies,".

144
00:07:45,942 --> 00:07:47,659
Rym: and they were really unimpressed with some of them.

145
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:53,740
Rym: However, I point out that one of the movies was The Fifth Element, which is a pretty old movie.

146
00:07:54,441 --> 00:08:04,460
Scott: Yeah, but according to some other podcast I listened to this morning, The Fifth Element is the big movie for testing out an HD TV and all that kind of video stuff.

147
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,718
Rym: Yeah, I didn't know that, so...

148
00:08:05,981 --> 00:08:06,787
Scott: I didn't know it either.

149
00:08:06,827 --> 00:08:07,693
Scott: I don't even know if it's true.

150
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:08,519
Scott: It's hearsay.

151
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:16,695
Rym: But apparently, at least one reviewer said that the best movie in terms of quality was 50 First Dates, which is that Adam Sandler movie.

152
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:17,579
Rym: I never saw it.

153
00:08:18,722 --> 00:08:20,499
Scott: What does that movie have to gain by being in HD?

154
00:08:21,664 --> 00:08:22,447
Rym: I really don't know.

155
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:29,540
Rym: I mean, to me, the only things that gain from being HD are high production value awesome movies.

156
00:08:30,401 --> 00:08:33,296
Scott: Yeah, movies like The Lord of the Rings has something to gain in HD.

157
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:44,059
Scott: There's a website that has screenshots of the difference between the HD Lord of the Rings and the film and the regular VHS or regular DVD, and it's astonishing the difference.

158
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:55,459
Rym: Even though, I'll point out that that website is a little deceptive because when you show a frame, yes, the difference is incredibly obvious, but when it's moving, it's actually very difficult to tell.

159
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:56,128
Scott: It is.

160
00:08:56,149 --> 00:08:56,474
Scott: It is.

161
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:08,123
Rym: However, the difference is still there, and I should say real quickly that high definition is awesome, and I always want technology, especially display technology, to get better and better and better.

162
00:09:08,646 --> 00:09:12,322
Rym: My issue is not that this technology is not good because I want things to get better.

163
00:09:12,904 --> 00:09:21,060
Rym: My issue is that HD DVD and Blu-ray are DRM encumbered evil crap that exists solely to milk money out of consumers who don't know better.

164
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:27,558
Scott: It's like everyone's bought the latest and greatest technology, right?

165
00:09:27,578 --> 00:09:28,962
Scott: Everyone's bought a DVD player.

166
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:30,747
Scott: There's $20 DVD players out there.

167
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:41,349
Scott: If they want to make more money, if you're in a DVD player making business, you're not going to make enough money just on selling replacements for broken DVD players.

168
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:48,340
Scott: You need to come out with something new, so you just call it, but the HD on front of it, and now you sell everyone in the world a new player.

169
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,979
Scott: You know, that's how it works.

170
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,000
Rym: Plus, I mean, the whole format war, there was no reason to have Blu-ray and HD DVD.

171
00:09:56,561 --> 00:09:59,600
Rym: It was just pride and money grubbing on both sides of that fence.

172
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,166
Scott: I don't really understand why people... It wasn't people.

173
00:10:03,267 --> 00:10:04,838
Rym: It's Sony, because Sony...

174
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:05,884
Scott: Well, it's everyone else.

175
00:10:05,944 --> 00:10:07,252
Scott: There's like two teams.

176
00:10:07,332 --> 00:10:08,720
Scott: Sony's the head of one team.

177
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,299
Rym: Yeah, but Sony's team always loses.

178
00:10:10,842 --> 00:10:14,198
Scott: Yeah, the thing I don't understand is why even have a format war?

179
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:24,220
Scott: Sure, you can do evil license fees and stuff, but if you really want to make money, just everyone standardize in an open format, and then make a better player than anyone else.

180
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:39,800
Scott: If you're fighting to make a closed format and then have that be the standard so that you can get control of the market as opposed to someone else, that tells me that you make shit players, and you don't have confidence in the quality of the hardware you make to beat out everyone else.

181
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:52,419
Scott: If there was just one standard, like if HD DVD was it, and that was the only thing, and everyone did it, then if you're fighting against it, you're telling me that you don't think you can make a better player than everyone else.

182
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:59,791
Rym: Unless the fight had nothing to do with any of that, and the fight was purely a "my format is technologically superior.

183
00:10:59,891 --> 00:11:00,172
Rym: Look at

184
00:11:00,232 --> 00:11:00,513
Rym: this.".

185
00:11:01,136 --> 00:11:02,220
Rym: But it's never been that way.

186
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:07,580
Scott: Nope, it's never been... Well, it's been that way a little bit, but it's never been such a difference to matter.

187
00:11:07,962 --> 00:11:11,560
Rym: It seems really that Sony is always the instigator here.

188
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:24,745
Rym: I mean, every time there's some sort of format, Sony always tries to make a proprietary crap one, and even though it's really good, they encumber it, and they cripple it, and they don't want other people to use it, and then everyone else standardizes on something else, and Sony loses.

189
00:11:25,107 --> 00:11:26,818
Rym: But they don't learn their lesson, and they keep doing it.

190
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:28,580
Scott: A-Track 3, anyone?

191
00:11:28,842 --> 00:11:29,339
Rym: Mini Disc.

192
00:11:30,101 --> 00:11:32,080
Scott: Well, Mini Disc is different, slightly.

193
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,640
Rym: Yeah, but it still ended up, it's pretty much dead in the US.

194
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:36,779
Rym: Yep, yep.

195
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,720
Scott: All right, so Craigslist, the amazing site for classified type ads of all sorts.

196
00:11:43,781 --> 00:11:53,420
Scott: I've always had one problem with it, and that's if you don't live in a super major city area, it's sometimes hard to get on Craigslist for any useful purpose.

197
00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:01,860
Scott: I mean, even where we live, I had to go to click on New York City, and then I had to click on Westchester, and then type in Beacon, and that's not even this county.

198
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,000
Scott: That's like a county away, is the closest I could get on Craigslist.

199
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:13,859
Rym: Yep, when I was looking for jobs way back, I found anything I found that was anywhere near the Mid-Hudson Valley, I just looked in the New York City category, and they were just all over the place randomly in there.

200
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,920
Scott: Yep, Craigslist has upgraded now, and they have added a shit ton of stuff.

201
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:25,740
Scott: They've got other countries on there, and they've added a whole bunch of cities, and I'm gonna link to a bunch of cities they added.

202
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:31,060
Scott: In New York, they've added Binghamton, New York, Long Island, there wasn't a Long Island.

203
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:34,160
Scott: If you lived in Long Island, you really couldn't use Craigslist.

204
00:12:34,786 --> 00:12:36,300
Rym: I guess Long Island is just New York City.

205
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,500
Scott: Yeah, and there's a Utica now, and there's a Hudson Valley, which is us.

206
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,020
Scott: We have our own Craigslist now, and it's really cool because it's super empty.

207
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,100
Scott: You know what we gotta do?

208
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,800
Scott: There's like seven Personals ads in there.

209
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,920
Rym: I realize right now what we need to do is put Moz in there.

210
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,520
Scott: I know, I was gonna put Moz in there when I make the announcement that there's a meeting this Saturday.

211
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,740
Rym: Yes, and promote the hell out of it, because I want to play some goddamn board games.

212
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,917
Scott: Yep, that's what I'm gonna do.

213
00:12:59,701 --> 00:13:15,479
Scott: So for anyone out there, you know, who maybe didn't know about Craigslist as the ultimate classified ads of the universe, or anyone out there who didn't use Craigslist because it wasn't supporting your geographic location, it might support your geographic location now.

214
00:13:15,983 --> 00:13:16,759
Scott: So go check it out.

215
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:26,560
Rym: And in fact, I'll note to any of you out there who may be looking for jobs in any technological field involving computers, Craigslist is pretty much the best place to get jobs.

216
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,640
Scott: I got my job through Craigslist, I posted my resume, a guy emailed me, I'm working there now.

217
00:13:31,002 --> 00:13:36,820
Rym: While I didn't get any of the jobs I've ever had through Craigslist, I've gotten countless offers directly as a result of Craigslist.

218
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:41,319
Rym: In fact, I'm still getting offers now that I already have a job that I'm not quitting anytime soon.

219
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,060
Scott: Yep, and also there is a section on Craigslist where you can supposedly get laid.

220
00:13:47,022 --> 00:13:48,959
Scott: I've never used it, but it's amusing to look at.

221
00:13:49,886 --> 00:13:50,560
Rym: Have you looked at it?

222
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,259
Scott: I looked at it once a long time ago, because someone linked to it.

223
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:02,517
Scott: Apparently it's just people saying things like, "I'm a dude, I live in this area, I'm this old, I want a girl to come suck my dick in the

224
00:14:02,537 --> 00:14:02,899
Scott: morning.".

225
00:14:03,322 --> 00:14:03,979
Rym: Wow, great.

226
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,636
Scott: And then, "I don't know if it

227
00:14:05,676 --> 00:14:05,879
Scott: works.".

228
00:14:07,543 --> 00:14:12,500
Rym: I wonder how close... I mean, I wonder how much of that edges toward prostitution.

229
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,520
Scott: I think it's consenting, non-paying adult encounter.

230
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,840
Scott: I think it's called the casual encounter section.

231
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:29,620
Rym: Oh yeah, but I just have this feeling that regardless of what actually is going on, because it's generally my opinion that any number of consenting adults can do whatever they want to each other.

232
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,078
Scott: I agree.

233
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:40,680
Rym: But I see the government, particularly certain elements of the government, and/or busybodies in local communities, once they discover this, coming down like a sack full of hammers.

234
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:45,700
Scott: It's been there for a long time, and I guess Craig has his ass covered, because no one's done anything about it.

235
00:14:45,921 --> 00:14:48,440
Scott: You have to be over 18 to go in and even look at it.

236
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:50,259
Rym: I just think the Lotites don't know about it yet.

237
00:14:50,567 --> 00:14:50,860
Scott: Maybe.

238
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:59,719
Rym: Quite frankly, because I have a feeling that if this was well-known outside of the internet world, that there would be uptight biddies with their panties and a knot over it.

239
00:15:00,881 --> 00:15:05,580
Scott: I'd imagine so, but hey, maybe I'll go search to see if anything happened about it in the past.

240
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:17,180
Rym: All right, that music, for all of our new listeners, means it's time for Thing of the Day.

241
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,060
Scott: For Things of the Day.

242
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,960
Rym: Well, my Thing of the Day, and the new Thing of the Day.

243
00:15:21,181 --> 00:15:31,480
Scott: Well, each day of the podcast, we each talk about a thing that we found somewhere, usually on the internet, that is very amusing or interesting.

244
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:37,916
Rym: I believe the official language we used when we came up with it was "the most interesting thing we've seen on the internet in the last 24

245
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:38,077
Rym: hours.".

246
00:15:39,623 --> 00:15:40,936
Scott: Well, some of these aren't from the last 24 hours.

247
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,120
Scott: I remember we did a few retro Things of the Day.

248
00:15:45,087 --> 00:15:45,559
Rym: All right.

249
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:51,360
Scott: But yeah, if you go to our website, frontroadcrew.com, you can click the links to see the Things of the Day for yourself.

250
00:15:51,781 --> 00:16:00,280
Rym: Yep, even though not that many of you seem to follow the links, and I've discovered from talking to people that most people from my links just look in my Delicious and see what I've linked to lately.

251
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:10,740
Scott: Yeah, Delicious users, if you look at our Deliciouses, then you will see the things that we Deliciouses-es, and then you will know the things of the day beforehand, most likely.

252
00:16:11,941 --> 00:16:17,020
Rym: Anyway, my Thing of the Day is a video that I found just now.

253
00:16:17,201 --> 00:16:22,438
Rym: It's been on the internet for a while, but it doesn't seem to have hit all the big sites yet, so I'm ahead of the curve here.

254
00:16:23,401 --> 00:16:40,380
Rym: It's a nice example of something that's called the "ground effect," which I'm not going to try to explain in 30 seconds, but suffice to say, it's a cool video of a guy jumping out of a helicopter at the top of a mountain without deploying his parachute for a long time, not dying.

255
00:16:41,281 --> 00:16:47,200
Scott: Yeah, he pretty much flies 15 or so feet above the snow for a good long distance.

256
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:53,180
Rym: I mean, I've seen videos of the ground effect, like little videos of like a little paper airplane doing something, or things people have made.

257
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,500
Rym: This is the most amazing ground effects video I've ever seen.

258
00:16:56,901 --> 00:16:58,920
Scott: Even more amazing than the ground effects cars.

259
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,080
Rym: Yeah, and the ground effects cars are pretty badass.

260
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,899
Scott: Ground effects cars are insane.

261
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:17,280
Scott: It's basically this wicked fast car that suction cups to the ground via ground effects aerodynamic stuff, and it can just turn on a dime while going full speed, but if anything disrupts the car, it goes flying and kills the driver.

262
00:17:17,886 --> 00:17:18,618
Rym: And anyone nearby.

263
00:17:18,881 --> 00:17:22,638
Scott: That's why they don't use them anymore, but it's basically the fastest, awesomeness car.

264
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:27,859
Rym: Yeah, so if you're ever bored, other than watching the video, just Google around for "ground effect" and read all that physics.

265
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:31,679
Scott: That's an E-F-F-E-C-T, not A-F-F-E-C-T.

266
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:32,383
Scott: Mr.

267
00:17:32,404 --> 00:17:33,760
Rym: Period will come down on you.

268
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,320
Scott: That's right.

269
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,375
Scott: My Thing of the Day is a nice little Photoshop contest on Worth 1000 called "Real Life Merit Badges

270
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,181
Scott: 3.".

271
00:17:42,181 --> 00:17:45,457
Scott: I assume there must be a Real Life Merit Badges 1 and 2, but I've never seen them.

272
00:17:46,862 --> 00:18:05,140
Scott: This really stands out because there's some good merit badges in here, like the iPod listening merit badge, the toast-making merit badge, which is ridiculously cute, the Photoshop merit badge, and it seems to be everyone's favorite that keeps showing up all over the internet.

273
00:18:05,341 --> 00:18:09,819
Scott: is this guy made the Tetris merit badge, which is way cool.

274
00:18:10,205 --> 00:18:11,060
Rym: I gotta say it was good.

275
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:16,880
Rym: I mean, Worth 1000 seems to be a little bit derided by a lot of the other places where Photoshop contests appear.

276
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,960
Rym: It's much more, I guess, mainstream.

277
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,500
Rym: A lot of times real news sites will link to it.

278
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:37,879
Scott: Yeah, but it seems to me that Worth 1000, unlike Fark, which is mostly about the comedy of your Photoshop, Worth 1000, it seems to be people priding themselves on not only the cleverness and comedy of their Photoshops, but the quality of their Photoshop skills.

279
00:18:38,101 --> 00:18:43,040
Rym: Yes, I mean, it's more heavily moderated and chosen than I'd say Photoshop Fridays are.

280
00:18:43,683 --> 00:18:49,120
Scott: But these guys will say stuff like, "Please click and see the uncompressed version of my Photoshop.

281
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,395
Scott: Compression kills the image

282
00:18:50,435 --> 00:18:50,760
Scott: quality.".

283
00:18:51,983 --> 00:18:54,720
Scott: And it's like, "All right, I don't really care about your Photoshop skills.

284
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,451
Scott: I just care if it's

285
00:18:55,512 --> 00:18:55,797
Scott: funny.".

286
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:01,339
Scott: And this is pretty amusing, so it's worth a look, especially for the Leet merit badge.

287
00:19:03,205 --> 00:19:14,920
Rym: But anyway, today, as we said in the beginning, we're going to be talking about me, a long-time Windows and primarily Linux user, who very recently switched to a Mac Mini.

288
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,140
Scott: We didn't switch, you got one.

289
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,180
Rym: Well, I switched because my Linux box is real old and real slow.

290
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,960
Scott: All right, well, let's give some backstory here.

291
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,760
Rym: All right, now I'll point out that this is mostly Scott's doing.

292
00:19:24,861 --> 00:19:26,100
Scott: All right, then I'll give the backstory.

293
00:19:26,342 --> 00:19:26,700
Rym: All right.

294
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,738
Scott: So the backstory is this.

295
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,699
Scott: Rym has a shitty old computer.

296
00:19:31,163 --> 00:19:32,259
Rym: It's over six years old.

297
00:19:32,866 --> 00:19:33,879
Scott: It's basically worthless.

298
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,220
Scott: And we use it to do the podcast.

299
00:19:36,581 --> 00:19:37,520
Rym: And it works really well.

300
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,780
Rym: It just takes about 10 minutes to encode.

301
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,479
Scott: But there were some kinks in the process.

302
00:19:41,641 --> 00:19:43,040
Scott: It wasn't perfectly smooth.

303
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,340
Scott: And I was like, "You need a new computer.

304
00:19:45,762 --> 00:19:48,040
Scott: We want to make the podcast operation smoother.

305
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,777
Scott: You know, let's do

306
00:19:49,838 --> 00:19:49,878
Scott: it.".

307
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:56,915
Scott: And I figured after a long time of thinking, "Hey, we can get those, you know, look at what Rym does with his

308
00:19:56,935 --> 00:19:57,279
Scott: computer.".

309
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:57,999
Scott: He browsed the web.

310
00:19:58,321 --> 00:19:58,980
Scott: He does IM.

311
00:19:59,803 --> 00:20:00,780
Scott: He does the podcast.

312
00:20:01,306 --> 00:20:02,519
Rym: I do mostly audio.

313
00:20:03,024 --> 00:20:03,998
Scott: He does a lot of audio.

314
00:20:05,463 --> 00:20:11,418
Scott: He, you know, he likes to play games, but because the new Intel Macs can boot camp, he can do that.

315
00:20:11,981 --> 00:20:14,860
Rym: Yep, I mean, the Mac Minis can't play Half-Life 2 at all.

316
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:15,898
Rym: They can play Half-Life.

317
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,980
Scott: Well, that's just because you bought the non-dual core.

318
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,540
Rym: No, even the dual core really can't go well.

319
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,440
Scott: Well, that's because the video card is poopy in the Mini.

320
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,440
Rym: Yeah, I'd have to get a MacBook Pro or something, but that's a whole other...

321
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,979
Scott: Well, no, a regular MacBook should do it.

322
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,360
Scott: Or maybe an iMac would do it.

323
00:20:28,441 --> 00:20:30,800
Rym: Apparently, even the MacBook Pro gets okay performance.

324
00:20:31,881 --> 00:20:37,697
Scott: Anyway, the point is, is that after thinking about it, I realized, "Hey, the Mac does everything that Rym

325
00:20:37,757 --> 00:20:38,139
Scott: needs.".

326
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:44,159
Rym: So Q. Scott starting a massive concerted campaign to convince me to buy a Mac.

327
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:46,499
Rym: He got the whole forum against me.

328
00:20:46,923 --> 00:20:47,980
Rym: He calls my girlfriend.

329
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,220
Scott: I didn't call her, but she kind of offered her services.

330
00:20:52,783 --> 00:20:57,340
Rym: I was attacked from every front to buy a Mac, and I was kind of leaning...

331
00:20:57,441 --> 00:21:01,979
Scott: The other reason was that Rym doesn't have an MP3 player, and now he has a commute in the car.

332
00:21:02,901 --> 00:21:06,020
Scott: So the thing is, should he get the iPod or not?

333
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:12,499
Scott: And the iPod really only fully works beautifully when combined with iTunes, but it is a beautiful combination when it works.

334
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,378
Rym: Yes, it is.

335
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,337
Rym: I mean, I want to do a separate show just about MP3 players.

336
00:21:16,924 --> 00:21:17,680
Scott: iPod plus iTunes?

337
00:21:18,006 --> 00:21:18,260
Scott: Yeah.

338
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:30,499
Scott: Because really, if you get a non-iPod MP3 player or use a non-iTunes podcatcher player sinker program, it is not as smooth no matter what you do.

339
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,940
Rym: iTunes and iPod are real slick.

340
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:39,440
Rym: And despite all of the other things I may say about Apple in these next 40 minutes or so, iTunes and iPod, slick.

341
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:46,120
Scott: Yes, but besides that, because you can do that with Windows, we mostly bought this Mac for the podcasting.

342
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,720
Rym: Yep, meaning GarageBand, the integrated sound card, all the fun Mac stuff, the fact that it's real fast.

343
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,960
Rym: I mean, this thing is many times faster than my current computer.

344
00:21:56,001 --> 00:21:57,339
Scott: And it's only the Core Solo, right?

345
00:21:57,622 --> 00:22:00,700
Rym: It's only the Core Solo, which is still much faster than my current computer.

346
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,834
Scott: Oh yeah, I guess you forgot to say that after much campaigning, Rym went to the store and bought a $600 Mac Mini.

347
00:22:05,822 --> 00:22:07,518
Scott: In fact, I just- And an iPod Nano.

348
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,139
Rym: Yes, and a bit to put it in my car.

349
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:22,478
Rym: I just drove to White Plains for my work, bought a Mac Mini over lunch, drove back to my work, and then I sat there at my work for the rest of the day doing work with this Mac Mini and an iPod and everything sitting there next to me.

350
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,379
Scott: I can't do that.

351
00:22:23,621 --> 00:22:26,298
Scott: On the day when the Wii comes out, I'm not going to work.

352
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:27,600
Scott: So no chance.

353
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,199
Rym: I sit there and I keep looking at it and fiddling with it.

354
00:22:30,501 --> 00:22:35,355
Rym: And finally, my boss guy, he's sitting there and he looks and he says, "What's that?

355
00:22:36,241 --> 00:22:38,156
Rym: Did you go buy a Mac over

356
00:22:38,216 --> 00:22:38,599
Rym: lunch?".

357
00:22:39,423 --> 00:22:40,739
Rym: And I'm like, "Uh, yeah, I did.

358
00:22:41,362 --> 00:22:41,995
Rym: Let me see, let me

359
00:22:42,036 --> 00:22:42,179
Rym: see.".

360
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,457
Rym: And then everyone came around, I had to open it and show it to everyone, and I didn't do any more work.

361
00:22:46,785 --> 00:22:47,171
Rym: They were all...

362
00:22:47,842 --> 00:22:48,778
Scott: You know what that tells you?

363
00:22:49,141 --> 00:22:50,999
Scott: You should just buy something every day.

364
00:22:51,821 --> 00:22:53,900
Rym: Yeah, yeah, that's a great use of all my credit.

365
00:22:54,163 --> 00:22:54,476
Scott: It is.

366
00:22:55,302 --> 00:22:56,640
Scott: And then you never have to do any work.

367
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,859
Scott: They just keep paying you to buy new things and showing it to them every day.

368
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,500
Scott: Come one day, roll an HDTV in there.

369
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,299
Rym: Honestly, this is the most non-technical job I've ever had.

370
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:06,833
Scott: Yeah.

371
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,499
Scott: Anyway, so we got the Mac and...

372
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,739
Rym: I bought it, I installed it, I plugged it in, and I was real impressed with it.

373
00:23:16,082 --> 00:23:22,959
Rym: It's real shiny, it's real simple and quick, the only thing... Now remember, this is all from my cursory, you know, the first few days of using it.

374
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:29,380
Rym: I mean, I still was doing the podcast in Linux because that was all set up, and I could knock out podcasts without even blinking.

375
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:30,980
Rym: I have everything set up so perfectly.

376
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:38,240
Rym: So on the Mac, I fiddled with it bit by bit, but I didn't get to fully use it until yesterday.

377
00:23:39,582 --> 00:23:42,420
Rym: Well, Sunday, really, and Saturday a bit.

378
00:23:43,662 --> 00:23:52,299
Rym: I didn't have any time, you know, podcast, work, all the other stuff we do, but my initial impression was great, and everyone I talked to, I told them how wonderful it was, and I loved my little Mac.

379
00:23:53,001 --> 00:24:00,380
Rym: The only problem I had of everything I did was that Mac mouse drivers are terrible.

380
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,120
Rym: Absolutely terrible.

381
00:24:02,463 --> 00:24:03,739
Rym: It was almost a deal breaker.

382
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:14,759
Scott: Yeah, it's like, I knew that Macs had a mouse problem, but it slipped my mind, honestly, when I was, you know, like, if I would have remembered it, I would have listed it in my list of reasons Rym should get a Mac.

383
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,819
Scott: I would have put one reason not to get a Mac.

384
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,059
Scott: Rym will hate the mouse.

385
00:24:18,821 --> 00:24:21,000
Rym: Now, the thing is, I'd used a lot of Macs before.

386
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:27,199
Rym: I mean, Emily has a Mac, Yuko has a Mac, Nuri has a Mac, a lot of people we know have Macs.

387
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:32,419
Rym: And most of them have the Mac mouse, you know, that funny, cool looking thing with one button.

388
00:24:33,483 --> 00:24:41,258
Rym: And whenever I use their computers, the mouse always felt really, really crappy, just really not accurate and wooshy.

389
00:24:41,925 --> 00:24:45,820
Scott: See, I didn't realize that you thought it was the actual physical mouse causing the problem.

390
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,980
Rym: I thought it was the mouse itself.

391
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,759
Scott: I knew that it was the operating system and I could have told you.

392
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,160
Rym: I thought that if I plug my awesome Logitech mouse in, it would work great.

393
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:54,780
Scott: No, I could have told you that.

394
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,420
Scott: It was terrible.

395
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,760
Scott: I guess you had to find out on your own because I forgot.

396
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,980
Rym: So then I thought, oh, Logitech makes OSX drivers.

397
00:25:01,102 --> 00:25:01,838
Rym: I'll just install it.

398
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,639
Rym: Logitech's OSX driver doesn't do dick.

399
00:25:07,003 --> 00:25:09,900
Rym: All it does is let you configure the buttons on your mouse.

400
00:25:10,725 --> 00:25:11,138
Rym: That's it.

401
00:25:12,024 --> 00:25:14,740
Scott: I guess that would be handy for my mouse, which has 12 buttons.

402
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:19,460
Scott: But for your mouse, which is a normal two button and a click wheel, it doesn't do anything.

403
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,779
Rym: I mean, I've set the mouse sensitivity on the Mac as high as it'll go.

404
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,038
Rym: And it's not even a quarter of what I want it to be.

405
00:25:25,407 --> 00:25:25,514
Scott: Yeah.

406
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,260
Scott: For anyone who doesn't realize, we set mouse sensitivities way up.

407
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,480
Rym: Like, let me put it this way.

408
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:32,019
Rym: In my old Windows box, right?

409
00:25:32,581 --> 00:25:39,400
Rym: I hacked the registry to set the absolute maximum sensitivity Windows will allow in that numeric field.

410
00:25:39,803 --> 00:25:45,439
Scott: For anyone who doesn't know what mouse sensitivity is, just in case, you can go into whatever operating system you run.

411
00:25:45,642 --> 00:25:46,099
Scott: It doesn't matter.

412
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:49,560
Scott: You can change your mouse motion speed or sensitivity.

413
00:25:50,362 --> 00:25:59,259
Scott: If it's less sensitive, that means you have to move the mouse physically very, very far to make the arrow on the screen move very, very far.

414
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:09,740
Scott: So if you put a low sensitivity, you might have to move the mouse all the way across your desk, pick it up, and move it all the way across your desk again, just to get the mouse to go across the whole monitor.

415
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:11,979
Rym: I mean, not to exaggerate at all here.

416
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:24,180
Rym: When I set up a mouse in my perfect world, and my Linux box is this way, and my Windows box is this way, I never move the mouse outside of a little bit less than an inch in any direction ever.

417
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:24,969
Scott: Yep.

418
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,860
Scott: With a high sensitivity, you can move the mouse maybe a centimeter.

419
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,799
Scott: And then it'll jump all the way across the screen.

420
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,960
Rym: I mean, literally, I only use my thumb and my pinky finger.

421
00:26:35,223 --> 00:26:36,760
Rym: And I just kind of twitch them back and forth.

422
00:26:36,821 --> 00:26:37,600
Rym: And that's how I use a mouse.

423
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,760
Rym: That's why I don't have carpal tunnel.

424
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:43,459
Scott: I just-- Somehow I don't think that's the way to avoid carpal tunnel, because I don't have it either.

425
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,740
Rym: Yeah, but you also use a very high sensitivity.

426
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:53,859
Scott: Not quite that high, but-- Yeah, but the correct ergonomic way to use a mouse according to the internet is not the way you or I use it.

427
00:26:54,280 --> 00:27:00,039
Rym: But anyway, to all of you Mac users out there, because the main part of this episode is that I have just switched to Mac.

428
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,359
Rym: And I have a lot of questions for all of you out there.

429
00:27:03,662 --> 00:27:05,739
Rym: And I'm really curious as to how you'll answer them.

430
00:27:06,605 --> 00:27:07,520
Rym: This is the first question.

431
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,060
Rym: And this is just from my preliminary usage.

432
00:27:09,342 --> 00:27:11,700
Rym: Is there any way to make the mouse better and more sensitive?

433
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:16,019
Rym: Or do you guys even realize how horribly inaccurate your Mac mice are?

434
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,680
Rym: Or is there a trick you guys know that I don't know to make it work?

435
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:25,399
Scott: Maybe this is why there are no FPSes for the Mac, because as soon as someone tries to make one, they realize, oh, shit, the mouse makes it impossible to win.

436
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,479
Scott: You'll just die.

437
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:27,460
Rym: Yeah.

438
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,720
Rym: But anyway, now, other than that, everything was great.

439
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:33,260
Rym: I mean, I was playing with widgets.

440
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,399
Rym: And they're really cool.

441
00:27:34,866 --> 00:27:35,900
Rym: And everything's really pretty.

442
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,420
Rym: And everything installed really easily.

443
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,560
Rym: And Firefox was fast.

444
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,359
Rym: And everything was great.

445
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,879
Scott: Yeah, compared to your old computer, everything would be as terrific.

446
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,939
Scott: You know, a Firefox that actually plays YouTubes without delay.

447
00:27:45,242 --> 00:27:45,330
Scott: Yeah.

448
00:27:46,501 --> 00:27:47,840
Scott: Sound that plays.

449
00:27:48,241 --> 00:27:48,819
Rym: Well, mostly.

450
00:27:49,362 --> 00:27:50,019
Rym: I'll get to that.

451
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,499
Rym: But everything just worked.

452
00:27:52,021 --> 00:27:53,500
Rym: So I told everyone, Macs are great.

453
00:27:53,762 --> 00:27:54,678
Rym: I'm really happy with this.

454
00:27:55,001 --> 00:27:56,559
Rym: And I fiddled with GarageBand a little bit.

455
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:05,720
Rym: But it wasn't until Sunday when I sat down for like five hours and tried to do all the real stuff that I do on my computer.

456
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,140
Rym: I started installing the weird stuff I use.

457
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:12,740
Rym: I started actually trying to use GarageBand to make podcasts and audio.

458
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,278
Rym: I tried using the sequencer.

459
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,079
Rym: I tried installing codecs and weird things.

460
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:18,620
Rym: I tried fiddling with everything.

461
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:34,660
Rym: And before I continue, I would like to say right now that this isn't a case of something that a lot of people accuse us of often, of trying something out, looking for anything bad, in order to have a reason to not like it, or looking for all the faults.

462
00:28:35,282 --> 00:28:37,160
Rym: I really, really want to like this Mac.

463
00:28:37,721 --> 00:28:41,900
Rym: I really, really want to be a Mac user and do this.

464
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,440
Rym: But I have a lot of issues with OS X and Apple in general.

465
00:28:47,602 --> 00:28:50,480
Rym: And they have come out in my use of this Mac.

466
00:28:50,941 --> 00:28:58,839
Rym: And I implore any Mac users out there, if you have any answers or any solutions to all of the things I bring up, I am more than happy to listen.

467
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:01,939
Rym: Because I have until next Tuesday to return this thing.

468
00:29:02,842 --> 00:29:09,419
Rym: And as much as it pains me, I am leaning, I'd say about 20% toward just returning it and being done with this.

469
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:15,940
Scott: Yeah, it looks like right now, we're either going to return it and get the money back, which actually costs 60 bucks.

470
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,519
Rym: Yeah, which saves me because for the money-- 540 bucks.

471
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,619
Rym: With 540 bucks, I could build a bad ass PC.

472
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,278
Scott: Yep, and use Ubuntu.

473
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:28,662
Rym: Well, actually, I'll probably use Gen 2.

474
00:29:28,662 --> 00:29:32,500
Scott: Anyway, or we can delegate it to being the living room PC.

475
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,979
Scott: And I'll just buy half of it from Rym, so it's fair.

476
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:39,400
Rym: Yep, which actually isn't that bad of an idea because it seems to work really well in that sense.

477
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:48,599
Scott: Yeah, as long as we can get it to play all the video codecs we want it to play, it'll be a good living room PC as opposed to a podcast PC.

478
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,318
Scott: But also, we'll have a use for going on trips because it's small.

479
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:59,797
Scott: Yep, and in trips, doing live shows at conventions, and when our Apple friends come over, they'll have a way to interface with us.

480
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:00,771
Rym: Yep, yep.

481
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:09,980
Scott: All right, so I also want to say that a lot of the problems Rym is going to complain about, I didn't know them beforehand.

482
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:16,059
Rym: Yes, to Scott's credit, when he convinced me to buy a Mac, everything he said sounded great, and I had no reason to disagree with him.

483
00:30:16,601 --> 00:30:30,659
Scott: Yeah, and many of the things I said I knew for a fact, but a couple of the things I said were based on the widely shared opinion of many, many Mac users, and I had no reason to disbelieve them.

484
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:33,240
Scott: And usually, I don't trust other people's opinions.

485
00:30:33,702 --> 00:30:36,832
Scott: If someone else gives an opinion, I said, "I don't care what you think, I'm going to go find out for

486
00:30:36,873 --> 00:30:37,217
Scott: myself.".

487
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:44,578
Scott: But I trusted that everyone was saying, "Oh, GarageBand is the greatest thing for podcasting, and why wouldn't it be?

488
00:30:45,442 --> 00:30:47,013
Scott: It's the only software in the

489
00:30:47,114 --> 00:30:47,516
Scott: universe.".

490
00:30:48,121 --> 00:31:00,919
Scott: Apple pretty much invented podcasting, not technically, that Weiner guy did, but they make all the podcasting stuff, they promote podcasting, And they sell their Macs for podcasting.

491
00:31:01,222 --> 00:31:02,159
Rym: Watch all their ads.

492
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:07,059
Rym: They sell Macs on the fact that, "Look, you can podcast with this.

493
00:31:07,521 --> 00:31:08,349
Rym: This is how you

494
00:31:08,369 --> 00:31:09,136
Rym: podcast.".

495
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:16,679
Scott: Yep, so it was just kind of obvious, without actually researching it, that GarageBand is the ultimate podcast tool.

496
00:31:17,341 --> 00:31:28,799
Rym: Now, I'd like to start with, because I have a lot of things to say, with the one thing that bothers me the most, and it bothers me not so much from a technical standpoint, because there are ways around it.

497
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,858
Rym: I can deal with it.

498
00:31:30,461 --> 00:31:34,280
Rym: It bothers me because this isn't the kind of behavior I would expect from Apple.

499
00:31:35,043 --> 00:31:36,160
Rym: I expect this from Sony.

500
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,539
Rym: I expect this from Microsoft.

501
00:31:38,261 --> 00:31:46,338
Rym: But Apple has proven to me that, in many ways, they're no better, and they're trying to lock you into proprietary crap formats, just like everyone else is.

502
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,699
Scott: In fact, I would say they're worse.

503
00:31:48,142 --> 00:31:53,995
Scott: Like, you know, people had always complained about, you know, they'll protest in front of Apple stores about iTunes DRM.

504
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,940
Scott: And I'm like, "Yeah, protest at iTunes DRM.

505
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,894
Scott: I don't buy anything from the iTunes Music

506
00:31:58,914 --> 00:31:59,217
Scott: Store.".

507
00:31:59,681 --> 00:32:03,538
Scott: You know, and if you know, if you go to the iTunes Music Store and buy music, it's DRM'd.

508
00:32:03,961 --> 00:32:06,660
Scott: And I'm against that, so I don't use the music store.

509
00:32:07,163 --> 00:32:09,140
Scott: And that's what I figured those guys are protesting.

510
00:32:09,582 --> 00:32:13,219
Scott: And not being a Mac user, I didn't realize it went much farther than that.

511
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:18,580
Rym: So, to start, in GarageBand, you say you make a podcast.

512
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:23,360
Rym: You record it, you edit, you're done with it, you're ready to make it into an actual podcast.

513
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:38,760
Rym: The only real options GarageBand gives you are to make a podcast, which means it downmixes it to a compressed AAC, which is completely incompatible with almost every MP3 player in the world except iPods.

514
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:39,422
Scott: Yup.

515
00:32:39,604 --> 00:32:40,392
Scott: How do you make an MP3, Ram?

516
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,599
Scott: Well, you know, a real file.

517
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,258
Rym: Well, the answer is you can't.

518
00:32:45,358 --> 00:32:45,440
Rym: Oh!

519
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,959
Rym: GarageBand, now you can't even pick what format it makes files in.

520
00:32:50,520 --> 00:33:02,540
Rym: Basically, it'll look at what kind of tracks you have, and it'll either make an AAC, which is compressed and Apple proprietary, or an AIFF, which is lossless, but also Apple proprietary.

521
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:08,660
Scott: Well, AACs can be played on, you know, like MPlayer and all that stuff.

522
00:33:08,841 --> 00:33:11,980
Scott: Yeah, but a lot of-- It's not an open, free format, really.

523
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,997
Rym: A lot of MP3 players can't play it.

524
00:33:15,063 --> 00:33:21,740
Rym: A lot of our listeners wouldn't be able to listen to GeekNights if we used that, especially if we used all that enhanced podcasting, blah, blah, blah.

525
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:29,479
Scott: Yeah, pretty much anyone who does do an enhanced podcast with the pictures and the links and all that other fancy stuff-- Which I think could be really cool.

526
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:29,921
Scott: Yup.

527
00:33:30,142 --> 00:33:37,891
Scott: Also releases a separate MP3 podcast, or else you're basically just saying, "If you don't have an iPod and iTunes, you can't listen to my show,

528
00:33:37,911 --> 00:33:38,195
Scott: sorry.".

529
00:33:38,802 --> 00:33:38,964
Rym: Yup.

530
00:33:39,025 --> 00:33:42,844
Rym: In fact, one of our listeners asked us why we didn't do it, and we went on a long rant as to why.

531
00:33:42,945 --> 00:33:45,440
Rym: the AAC podcast format is laughable.

532
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,198
Rym: But there's really no way to just make an MP3.

533
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,640
Rym: In fact, you can't even make a WAV file.

534
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:59,978
Rym: You can-- if you have a podcast track in the top, it'll automatically make an AAC, and you have very few options as to how you want it to make that AAC.

535
00:34:00,641 --> 00:34:03,159
Rym: It just kind of guesses as to what kind of quality you want.

536
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:15,159
Rym: If you get rid of that podcast track, then it'll make an AIFF, which is lossless, but also kind of useless, because outside of the Mac world, almost nothing supports that format.

537
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,120
Scott: Well, you can play that format, but not a whole lot of software will import that format.

538
00:34:21,341 --> 00:34:22,920
Scott: Only really proprietary software.

539
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,679
Scott: I think Audacity can import it now.

540
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,039
Rym: Yeah, if you're running it on a Mac.

541
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:26,764
Rym: Yeah.

542
00:34:27,005 --> 00:34:28,138
Scott: Well, it's, you know--.

543
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,719
Rym: Well, I guess I'll backtrack--.

544
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:32,380
Scott: It's not as good as WAV, because WAV works on anything.

545
00:34:32,722 --> 00:34:39,077
Rym: A long time ago, Emily sent me some cool things she'd done in school, some audio files, and she sent them to me as AIFFs.

546
00:34:40,024 --> 00:34:42,119
Rym: And I had absolutely no way to play them.

547
00:34:42,661 --> 00:34:51,039
Rym: And I've learned that a lot of Mac users don't realize that the rest of the world uses WAV and MP3, and AIFF is really only a Mac thing.

548
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:56,498
Scott: Yeah, I mean, if you install QuickTime on Windows, then you can play them, because that's Mac software.

549
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,118
Scott: It's QuickTime.

550
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:05,399
Rym: Oh, and going back to the whole QuickTime thing, Macs don't come with QuickTime Pro, so you can't do any of that cool stuff anyway, or converting between things.

551
00:35:05,764 --> 00:35:06,780
Rym: You have to pay for that extra.

552
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:10,260
Scott: Yeah, well, you know, it's on a Windows computer or a Linux computer.

553
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,880
Scott: There are free programs that let you pretty much convert any file format in the universe.

554
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,340
Scott: In Macs, there's QuickTime.

555
00:35:18,901 --> 00:35:22,299
Scott: And QuickTime does all your encodings and decodings and all that jazz.

556
00:35:22,741 --> 00:35:27,840
Scott: But to do super encodings and decodings of everything, you have to pay for QuickTime Pro or pirate it.

557
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:33,040
Rym: Now anyway, I simplified a little, and I want to expand on just how much this pisses me off.

558
00:35:34,224 --> 00:35:37,079
Rym: Now I said I could get AIFFs, the lossless ones out of there.

559
00:35:37,681 --> 00:35:39,040
Rym: You can't do that directly.

560
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,020
Rym: You can't just export to an AIFF on the disk.

561
00:35:42,481 --> 00:35:45,039
Rym: If you export to the disk, it makes it AAC.

562
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,580
Rym: There is no way around that that I can find.

563
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:55,676
Rym: The only way I've been able to get AIFFs out of GarageBand is to send the podcast I just made to iTunes.

564
00:35:57,441 --> 00:36:16,760
Rym: Once it's in iTunes, I then close iTunes, go to the iTunes music directory, and hidden in there is the AIFF that I then have to run a special application on to turn it into a WAV so that I can then convert it into an MP3 and then use something and then reopen it in iTunes, add the ID3 stuff, and then upload it to Libsyn.

565
00:36:17,561 --> 00:36:24,360
Scott: It seems to me like Apple, the software, really just tries to hide from you the fact that files even exist.

566
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,760
Rym: And is trying to force me to use the Apple proprietary stuff.

567
00:36:28,226 --> 00:36:31,560
Rym: and at every step of the way, they do everything they can to discourage you from using MP3s.

568
00:36:31,763 --> 00:36:36,340
Scott: They don't want you to realize that there's actually a folder full of MP3 files and AAC files somewhere.

569
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:49,640
Scott: They just want you to look in iTunes at your list of artists and albums and click on that and never actually know what's going on, which is great if you're just like my mom who can't manage a directory full of files.

570
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:53,460
Scott: But if you're a geek, you want to manage a directory full of files.

571
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,053
Scott: And if someone, you know, it's okay.

572
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:59,339
Scott: if someone tries to not show it to you or makes it so you don't have to look there.

573
00:36:59,823 --> 00:37:09,380
Scott: But to make it more difficult for you to do it when you want to or to conceal it or to put roadblocks in your way when you want to do something the real way is like grrr.

574
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:11,528
Rym: It's the worst thing.

575
00:37:11,588 --> 00:37:26,713
Rym: is that the reason I wanted to switch to a Mac is to make everything seamless because in Linux to make my podcast, I recorded in one program, exported it to a wave, opened it in another program, did stuff to it, saved it, ran a command line scripty that did all the rest of my stuff and uploaded it.

576
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:30,057
Rym: And Apple really sells their Macs.

577
00:37:30,258 --> 00:37:31,660
Rym: on the, you can just podcast.

578
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,497
Rym: It just works.

579
00:37:33,681 --> 00:37:36,200
Scott: It does if you do it Apple's way.

580
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:41,860
Rym: Meaning Apple's proprietary formats, meaning at least half the people out there can't listen to your podcast.

581
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,080
Scott: Most of the people out there can't listen to your podcast.

582
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:44,645
Rym: Yeah.

583
00:37:46,261 --> 00:37:48,400
Rym: So I have to do all these hackish things.

584
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,599
Rym: The kind of things I expect to have to do in Linux to make things work.

585
00:37:52,082 --> 00:37:52,658
Scott: Only worse.

586
00:37:53,921 --> 00:37:57,499
Scott: I mean, on Linux, if you just want to run lame, you get lame and you run it.

587
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,240
Scott: Here you have to go get this iTunes lame thing and it doesn't work quite right.

588
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,759
Scott: And you have to do stuff to it.

589
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:04,113
Rym: Yeah.

590
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:07,180
Rym: Keep in mind that iTunes has a convert to MP3 thing, right?

591
00:38:07,882 --> 00:38:09,920
Rym: One, it converts terribly.

592
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,616
Rym: It makes poor quality MP3s.

593
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,420
Rym: The internet has verified this for me.

594
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,299
Rym: I wasn't just crazy.

595
00:38:15,341 --> 00:38:18,080
Rym: Two, you can't pick what kind of MP3s it makes.

596
00:38:18,565 --> 00:38:19,519
Rym: It just picks a format.

597
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,040
Scott: Yeah.

598
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:24,219
Scott: It's like we want to make 96 kilobit per second mono MP3s.

599
00:38:24,481 --> 00:38:25,239
Scott: It doesn't let you choose.

600
00:38:25,383 --> 00:38:25,935
Scott: It just makes an MP3.

601
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,734
Rym: Now, a lot of you are going to say, "Yeah, you can choose in the import

602
00:38:28,774 --> 00:38:29,058
Rym: section.".

603
00:38:29,362 --> 00:38:29,939
Rym: You're wrong.

604
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,199
Rym: You can choose in the import section if you're ripping CDs.

605
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:39,080
Rym: If you are converting files that are in the iTunes library to MP3, that setting does nothing.

606
00:38:41,061 --> 00:38:41,360
Rym: All right.

607
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,896
Rym: So I have to do all these hacks to get an MP3.

608
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:47,799
Rym: It basically, it takes longer for me to do the podcast than it does in Linux because I have to do all this extra stuff.

609
00:38:48,582 --> 00:38:49,179
Rym: All right, fine.

610
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:55,639
Rym: But theoretically, the interface of GarageBand and the awesome that is GarageBand should more than make up for that.

611
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,038
Rym: I mean, GarageBand has all that special stuff in it.

612
00:38:59,181 --> 00:39:03,960
Rym: I submit to you that GarageBand's interface is terrible.

613
00:39:05,783 --> 00:39:07,240
Rym: I've been using it for many hours.

614
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:13,717
Rym: In fact, I've been using it for a couple days now trying to learn it, trying to use it, trying to make it do what I want to do.

615
00:39:14,601 --> 00:39:25,099
Rym: And over time, I figured out how to make it do things, but everything's just so counterintuitive and completely different from all the normal audio editing programs I've used in my entire life.

616
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:31,640
Scott: Well, I think part of it is that GarageBand is made for music composition and sequencing.

617
00:39:32,222 --> 00:39:34,140
Scott: It's really not what you want for a podcast.

618
00:39:34,381 --> 00:39:34,717
Rym: Yes, it is.

619
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,299
Rym: They bill it as a podcast program.

620
00:39:36,601 --> 00:39:36,771
Scott: They do.

621
00:39:37,301 --> 00:39:43,660
Scott: But for podcasting, what you really want is a wave editor because you're dealing with a lot of waves.

622
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:51,700
Rym: Well, in fact, I could do a whole thing and we should probably do a show on this, but to do a podcast, you need a wave editor and a sequencer.

623
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,740
Rym: You basically need these two things to do your podcast.

624
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:02,500
Rym: And GarageBand is an okay sequencer mixed with an absolutely, I'm sorry to say this, piss-poor wave editor.

625
00:40:03,023 --> 00:40:03,979
Scott: It's not just piss-poor.

626
00:40:04,181 --> 00:40:05,959
Scott: It's worse than Audacity, which is free.

627
00:40:07,102 --> 00:40:16,019
Rym: Even after practicing and practicing, I can whip together and edit a podcast in about an eighth the time on Linux than it takes me to do it.

628
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,900
Rym: In fact, I still can't do it effectively in GarageBand.

629
00:40:20,165 --> 00:40:20,599
Rym: Simple thing.

630
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:29,559
Rym: Say I have a huge hour-long MP3 and Scott has a cold, let's say, or I have a cold and I coughed a bunch of times, like 10 times throughout the podcast.

631
00:40:30,181 --> 00:40:39,119
Rym: In Linux, while I'm recording, anytime something happens that I'm going to have to edit out later, because we really don't edit much, and in fact, the show we're doing right now, we're not going to edit at all.

632
00:40:39,361 --> 00:40:41,520
Scott: Because it's too much of a pain in the ass in GarageBand.

633
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,460
Rym: It's so hard to edit things in GarageBand.

634
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:48,420
Rym: See, a lot of podcasters have come to us and said, "How the hell do you do four episodes a night an hour long?

635
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:48,748
Rym: That's just

636
00:40:48,789 --> 00:40:49,178
Rym: crazy.".

637
00:40:49,301 --> 00:40:50,360
Scott: And now I'm beginning to reel.

638
00:40:50,520 --> 00:41:00,020
Scott: And also, a lot of other podcasts seem to play music as they record, as if they were doing a real radio show where you have to do things in real time.

639
00:41:00,101 --> 00:41:02,580
Scott: And we tend to do everything in post-production.

640
00:41:02,681 --> 00:41:04,000
Scott: We add our music in later.

641
00:41:04,683 --> 00:41:06,880
Scott: We don't play the music while we're talking.

642
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:09,200
Scott: But other podcasts seem to do that.

643
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,458
Scott: And now I realize why.

644
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:12,820
Scott: Because they're using GarageBand and we're not.

645
00:41:13,403 --> 00:41:17,100
Rym: And editing things in GarageBand is just this tedious, tedious process.

646
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,100
Rym: I have to click like twice as many times to make anything happen.

647
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:24,100
Rym: And the worst thing about it is that everything's contextual.

648
00:41:24,801 --> 00:41:27,699
Rym: So the context of what I'm doing will change, but I won't notice it.

649
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,178
Rym: And suddenly something doesn't work.

650
00:41:29,861 --> 00:41:33,658
Rym: Like if you click in a certain area of the screen, now this one thing won't work.

651
00:41:34,082 --> 00:41:35,780
Rym: But if you click in this other area, now it works.

652
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,739
Rym: Because you're not supposed to use that thing if you're in one context, but you're supposed to use another context.

653
00:41:40,283 --> 00:41:45,120
Rym: Or if you drag a file into the loop thing, it'll make a loop unless you're in this context.

654
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,298
Rym: And then it doesn't make a loop.

655
00:41:46,981 --> 00:41:53,358
Rym: Or if the file you want to make the loop out of, this is the thing that really got me just now, there's a limit to how big a loop can be.

656
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:57,578
Rym: So if you try to make a loop out of a file bigger than that limit, it just doesn't work.

657
00:41:58,262 --> 00:41:59,239
Rym: It doesn't give you an error.

658
00:41:59,823 --> 00:42:01,236
Rym: It doesn't say, "Hey, this is too

659
00:42:01,276 --> 00:42:01,559
Rym: long.".

660
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:03,080
Rym: It doesn't do anything.

661
00:42:03,462 --> 00:42:05,900
Rym: It just doesn't work and doesn't tell you why.

662
00:42:06,242 --> 00:42:06,738
Scott: I saw him.

663
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,600
Scott: He dragged the loop into this area.

664
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,980
Scott: I read the documentation.

665
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,878
Scott: It said, "If you want to add a new loop, drag the file into this

666
00:42:12,999 --> 00:42:13,180
Scott: area.".

667
00:42:13,261 --> 00:42:14,680
Scott: He dragged it into that area.

668
00:42:15,142 --> 00:42:18,020
Scott: It turned into an X and floated back to where it came from.

669
00:42:18,361 --> 00:42:19,299
Scott: It didn't tell you shit.

670
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:34,860
Scott: It's trying to make it so easy for idiots who will be scared of an error message, you know, Apple's interface guidelines don't make error messages show up because they scare stupid users, that it makes it impossible for someone who knows what they're doing to figure out what the fuck is going wrong.

671
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:37,300
Scott: It just frustrates the hell out of you and you want to destroy everyone.

672
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:38,118
Rym: You know what I did?

673
00:42:38,503 --> 00:42:47,339
Rym: I sat there dragging different WAVs because I had this whole directory of WAV files from all the sound effects from the podcast from before in the Linux box that I copied over.

674
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,220
Rym: And some would work and some wouldn't.

675
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:54,675
Rym: And over the course of experimentation, I figured out that, "Oh, it just won't accept files that are longer than

676
00:42:54,837 --> 00:42:54,857
Rym: X.".

677
00:42:56,145 --> 00:42:57,279
Rym: I shouldn't have to do that.

678
00:42:57,622 --> 00:42:58,478
Rym: It should just tell me.

679
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,460
Rym: Or there should be a document or something.

680
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:09,139
Scott: Yeah, and even if I tried searching on Google and Apple's website, all it says there is, if you want to add a loop, drag it into the thing.

681
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,392
Scott: That's the only documentation you can get.

682
00:43:11,654 --> 00:43:12,700
Scott: is the stuff for idiots.

683
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:30,280
Scott: There's no specific, you know, they've set all these defaults all over the place because there's a school of user interface design, which is actually pretty smart, that says, you know, in any part of your application, you can choose between giving the user an option or setting an intelligent default.

684
00:43:31,002 --> 00:43:35,019
Scott: And it's usually better to set an intelligent default because it's more user friendly.

685
00:43:35,685 --> 00:43:40,100
Scott: You know, it takes power away from the user, but it makes everything easier.

686
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,940
Scott: And if your default is intelligent, it won't matter.

687
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,829
Scott: You know, a good example is, I can't think of a good- You know what?

688
00:43:46,849 --> 00:43:47,139
Rym: Lame.

689
00:43:47,621 --> 00:43:51,135
Rym: A lot of lame implementations, by default, will just make a good MP3.

690
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:52,179
Scott: Yep, there you go.

691
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:56,636
Scott: If you type lame space and then the MP3, by default, it makes a pretty good MP3.

692
00:43:57,181 --> 00:43:58,500
Rym: You can do stuff to make it better.

693
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:01,199
Rym: You could do stuff to make it worse, but by default, it makes a good one.

694
00:44:01,901 --> 00:44:06,200
Scott: Apple seems to say, you know, we're not going to allow you to make it better or worse.

695
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,779
Scott: We're just going to give you the intelligent default, which would be fine.

696
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,980
Scott: But nowhere does it tell you what the intelligent defaults are.

697
00:44:12,341 --> 00:44:13,799
Scott: You can't figure this shit out.

698
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,760
Scott: There's no detailed documentation.

699
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,340
Scott: It's all idiot documentation.

700
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,619
Scott: It's worse than a dummy's book.

701
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,540
Rym: I mean, literally, I really hate to sound so down on Apple, but I ran into trouble.

702
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:24,618
Rym: Like, a thing wouldn't work.

703
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:29,940
Rym: So I'd go to Apple's website and look for some documentation, because there's no good documentation built into the computer.

704
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:36,899
Rym: And every piece of documentation I find on all of Apple's sites basically just says, oh, just do this and it works.

705
00:44:37,201 --> 00:44:38,580
Rym: Or just hit export.

706
00:44:38,881 --> 00:44:39,900
Rym: Oh, it's just so easy.

707
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,940
Scott: But I want to do something more advanced than that.

708
00:44:42,021 --> 00:44:43,419
Scott: I don't want to just drag it in.

709
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,140
Scott: I want to drag it in and set a bunch of options.

710
00:44:45,262 --> 00:44:45,920
Scott: Oh, they don't exist.

711
00:44:46,062 --> 00:44:46,940
Scott: Oh, that can't be done.

712
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:47,266
Scott: Oh.

713
00:44:47,881 --> 00:44:50,700
Rym: Or they do exist, but not in the program you're using.

714
00:44:52,883 --> 00:44:56,660
Rym: And the worst part is, then I thought, all right, I'll ask those cool Mac people.

715
00:44:56,721 --> 00:45:02,800
Rym: So I went into the Apple Talk forums and I saw people asking the same questions I was asking.

716
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,439
Rym: And they were getting hostile answers.

717
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,739
Rym: People were giving them, like, why would you want to do that?

718
00:45:07,941 --> 00:45:09,579
Rym: Or, oh, obviously do this.

719
00:45:10,121 --> 00:45:12,880
Rym: Or one guy was like, I can't do what I want to do.

720
00:45:13,041 --> 00:45:14,140
Rym: I'm going to return my Mac.

721
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,799
Rym: Can anyone convince me not to?

722
00:45:17,043 --> 00:45:18,600
Rym: And the responses were like, just return your Mac.

723
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:19,437
Rym: We don't want to deal with you.

724
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:20,413
Scott: Yeah.

725
00:45:21,201 --> 00:45:25,000
Scott: People say that Mac users are all friendly, cool, hip kids.

726
00:45:25,881 --> 00:45:28,420
Scott: And Linux users are all these crazy zealots.

727
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,860
Scott: And Windows users are just boring business guys.

728
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:31,610
Scott: No.

729
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:36,780
Scott: Nowadays, the Mac users are the crazy zealots with the proprietary closed software.

730
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:40,600
Scott: The Linux people are the friendly, happy, geeky, cool people.

731
00:45:41,003 --> 00:45:42,799
Scott: And the Windows people is everyone else.

732
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,200
Rym: I mean, I guess I don't want to go too much longer.

733
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,298
Rym: This has already been a long show.

734
00:45:46,741 --> 00:45:55,720
Rym: But I can't do things that I want to do in GarageBand that I could do easily with open source free software in Linux.

735
00:45:56,237 --> 00:45:56,320
Scott: Yep.

736
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:08,360
Scott: Now here's the thing is that it is, we did find a lot of ways to do these things on Apple with either A, buying software, B, pirating the same software, or C, installing some open source software.

737
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:11,860
Scott: But if we're going to do those things, why are we buying the Apple?

738
00:46:12,341 --> 00:46:14,460
Scott: We're buying the Apple for the Apple software.

739
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:21,360
Scott: If we're going to use open source software, I might as well get a cheap PC and run Ubuntu to use that open source software that can do the things we need.

740
00:46:21,802 --> 00:46:24,460
Scott: If I'm buying the Apple, it's for the Apple software.

741
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,920
Scott: And if the Apple software doesn't cut it, why are we paying for it?

742
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:31,420
Rym: Now to its credit, GarageBand seems to do a few things very well.

743
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:40,840
Rym: By default, it sets up some filters for our voices that seem to be pretty cool, even though it's not entirely easy to tell exactly what they're doing.

744
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:45,060
Scott: Yeah, it's like if you talk into it and play it back, it sounds good like a radio guy.

745
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,859
Scott: Someone must have set up a cool filter.

746
00:46:47,401 --> 00:46:51,140
Scott: But it doesn't tell you exactly what that filter is doing frequency wise.

747
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,940
Rym: Now I found out ways to find out what it's doing.

748
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,319
Rym: And I've been poking around a bit, and it seems pretty good.

749
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:00,180
Rym: But there's no easy interface to change this stuff.

750
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:01,440
Rym: Well, there's no good interface.

751
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:04,220
Rym: Like for an example, they have a compressor.

752
00:47:05,021 --> 00:47:07,261
Rym: And all it is is a slider from 0 to 100.

753
00:47:07,261 --> 00:47:08,399
Rym: How much do you want to compress this?

754
00:47:09,621 --> 00:47:14,299
Rym: I have a real hardware compressor sitting in front of me right now that we put this show through.

755
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:15,398
Scott: What is that, five dials?

756
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:22,659
Rym: It has, well one, on a real compressor, I can set the ratio of compression, the attack speed, the decay speed.

757
00:47:23,721 --> 00:47:26,600
Rym: I can set what kind of curve I want on the compressor.

758
00:47:27,061 --> 00:47:29,660
Rym: There's all these sorts of options that mean a lot.

759
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:34,179
Rym: And I've actually, I know a lot about this stuff, and I know how to set these things to make things sound good or bad.

760
00:47:35,704 --> 00:47:39,104
Rym: And in GarageBand, it just gives you a slider from 0 to 100.

761
00:47:39,104 --> 00:47:40,400
Rym: I don't know what that slider does.

762
00:47:40,521 --> 00:47:42,280
Rym: I assume they just made a default compressor.

763
00:47:44,901 --> 00:47:48,780
Scott: Yeah, I mean, an audio professional wouldn't know what to do with it.

764
00:47:49,604 --> 00:47:51,480
Scott: Because, and an idiot wouldn't know what to do with it either.

765
00:47:51,848 --> 00:47:52,420
Scott: What's the point?

766
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:57,420
Rym: But anyway, GarageBand is good at recording a live, live, live, live podcast.

767
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:02,840
Rym: As in, we're in front of people, we're going to record from start to finish, and then export.

768
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,200
Rym: Not counting the fact that exporting doesn't work unless you use all these hacks.

769
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,140
Scott: Yep, and it does seem to be pretty good at music.

770
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:11,499
Scott: Like if you're a musician or you want to do MIDI.

771
00:48:11,921 --> 00:48:13,619
Rym: Well, I thought that.

772
00:48:14,162 --> 00:48:15,279
Rym: I'm not going to get into it now.

773
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:22,419
Rym: I don't want to talk forever about this, but I was not at all impressed with the way GarageBand handles MIDI and music.

774
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,539
Scott: Because that's what it seems to be.

775
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:33,439
Scott: Like if I look through the documentation, the podcasting part is such a small portion, and most of it is music, music, music, music, plug your instruments into it, all these tracks, blah, blah, blah.

776
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:38,220
Rym: The way it is now is podcasting seems to be the primary focus of the program.

777
00:48:38,581 --> 00:48:43,043
Rym: But the music is there, and a lot of people have told me all the cool things that it can do.

778
00:48:43,500 --> 00:49:03,839
Rym: But as I've played with it, I hate to say this, but Cakewalk Studio, not even the professional one, but the cheapo, broken one that I pirated from my friend Ken a long time ago, was more full featured, had better everything, other than possibly the sound fonts, and had all the functions that GarageBand has.

779
00:49:04,281 --> 00:49:05,359
Rym: In fact, it had more functions.

780
00:49:05,981 --> 00:49:08,680
Rym: And it was like, it cost like 50 or 60 bucks back then, I think.

781
00:49:08,741 --> 00:49:09,380
Rym: It was almost nothing.

782
00:49:09,641 --> 00:49:11,060
Scott: Yeah, you only pirated because you're in high school.

783
00:49:11,422 --> 00:49:11,510
Scott: Yeah.

784
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:13,379
Scott: If you had money in those days, you might have bought it.

785
00:49:13,782 --> 00:49:14,257
Rym: And you know what?

786
00:49:14,622 --> 00:49:17,799
Rym: If I can find my old CD, because eventually I did buy it.

787
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:23,756
Rym: And I used it at RIT, in fact, in my Windows box to compose music for music theory classes I took.

788
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,540
Scott: Well, can we say that GarageBand is better than Mario Paint music making?

789
00:49:27,921 --> 00:49:28,677
Rym: Yes, yes.

790
00:49:29,125 --> 00:49:29,380
Rym: Okay.

791
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:38,318
Rym: And the thing is, GarageBand looks like it would be really great for when we go to conventions, because we can just record a podcast live, we can have all our sound effects live, we don't have to do much.

792
00:49:39,281 --> 00:49:52,940
Rym: It's really not good for doing the day-to-day podcast, because there's so much functionality that's either left out, crippled, or it's there, but the way to do it requires much more effort than Audacity or Resound on a Linux box would.

793
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:53,432
Scott: Yep.

794
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:58,157
Scott: One example that I noticed is, let's say, if you want to cut a piece out of the podcast, just remove it.

795
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:06,780
Scott: You have to click at the beginning of that piece, push a button, click at the end of that piece, push a button, click on the piece, push yet another button.

796
00:50:06,902 --> 00:50:07,940
Scott: It's actually not buttons.

797
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,700
Scott: You have to go to the menu and click on something which doesn't have a shortcut.

798
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:19,240
Scott: Drag something else and really kind of look at it with your squinty eyes to line it up, and then click two more things and push another button.

799
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:22,860
Rym: Now, I'll compare this right now to Resound and Audacity.

800
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:24,279
Rym: Actually, I'll do it with Resound.

801
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:30,799
Rym: Resound, for anyone, because you've never heard of this, a lot of people haven't heard of Resound, is a lot like Cool Edit Pro was.

802
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:37,960
Rym: And Cool Edit Pro was an awesome, awesome, awesome wave editor and a sequencer multi-track editor.

803
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:39,920
Scott: It is now Adobe Audition, it costs a lot of money.

804
00:50:40,101 --> 00:50:48,740
Rym: It was a badass program, it was very, very cheap, the people who made it were awesome, and it was pretty much the industry standard in radio, which I didn't know until recently.

805
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,680
Scott: Yeah, just about every radio station in the country used Cool Edit.

806
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:56,379
Rym: And in fact, a lot of radio stations apparently still use it because they don't want to upgrade to Audition.

807
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:56,790
Scott: Yep.

808
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:00,720
Rym: Audition, well, Adobe bought the company that made Cool Edit.

809
00:51:00,983 --> 00:51:01,780
Scott: A good business move.

810
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:09,740
Rym: And then they destroyed Cool Edit, and then they released a product that was almost as full featured as Cool Edit, called Adobe Audition.

811
00:51:10,821 --> 00:51:15,220
Rym: And they sell it for so much more money, it makes me want to cry.

812
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,920
Scott: Yeah, what did Cool Edit cost?

813
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:23,748
Rym: Cool, like, the generally full featured version of Cool Edit that almost anyone would need was 200, 250 bucks.

814
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,040
Scott: What does Audition cost?

815
00:51:26,221 --> 00:51:27,480
Rym: God, I don't even know offhand.

816
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:28,390
Rym: It's like 600 or 700 bucks, I think.

817
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:29,469
Rym: Really?

818
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,520
Rym: Don't quote me on that, because I don't know offhand.

819
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:35,480
Scott: Someone's going to be like, "Audition only costs blah, blah, blah, well you guys are

820
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:35,603
Scott: blah.".

821
00:51:36,201 --> 00:51:41,779
Rym: And let me put it this way, the version of Cool Edit that I could do the whole podcast in cost about 70 bucks.

822
00:51:42,843 --> 00:51:44,939
Rym: And I could do a whole podcast and that's just fine.

823
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,879
Rym: But ReSound is almost as good.

824
00:51:47,901 --> 00:51:52,398
Rym: And in ReSound, if I wanted to lead a section of a podcast, I literally go click, click, delete.

825
00:51:53,502 --> 00:52:01,560
Rym: If I right click on one side, I left click on the other side, I've made my bounds, it automatically pegs the bounds to the borders in my wave.

826
00:52:01,941 --> 00:52:08,177
Rym: So it'll see if I click real close to the edge of me talking, it'll go right at the end of the talking before the noise gate clips in.

827
00:52:09,966 --> 00:52:10,680
Rym: And it just works.

828
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,080
Rym: It automatically mixes a little bit between the two.

829
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,699
Rym: It does everything for me, which is the kind of stuff I expected the Apple to do.

830
00:52:17,063 --> 00:52:18,219
Rym: But the Mac doesn't do it.

831
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,060
Rym: The open source crap program that actually has a bunch of bugs in it does it better.

832
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:32,580
Scott: Yeah, we tried to get something new and spend some money, 600 bucks of money, to not have to live with these tiny little annoying bugs that were all over open source program.

833
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:37,240
Scott: Little did we know we were trading little tiny bugs for giant fucking roadblocks.

834
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,460
Rym: These bugs don't have to be here.

835
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:44,860
Rym: There's no reason Apple has to prevent me from making WAV and MP3 files other than their own self-interest.

836
00:52:46,643 --> 00:52:49,060
Rym: And all right, I don't want to go on about GarageBand anymore.

837
00:52:49,681 --> 00:52:53,760
Rym: If anyone has any tips on how to make GarageBand not terrible, let me know.

838
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:56,940
Scott: Yeah, tell us how to not suck with GarageBand.

839
00:52:57,181 --> 00:53:01,360
Rym: I'm really asking for your advice, because I'm hoping that I'm just missing something.

840
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:02,453
Rym: Or that there's a--.

841
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:03,779
Scott: Yes, there is.

842
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:13,200
Scott: I do have this 1% feeling, because in the past, Rym has been subpar at figuring out how to use certain things.

843
00:53:13,421 --> 00:53:14,899
Rym: Well, let me at least say this.

844
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:18,320
Rym: When I first used ReSound, I said, "Oh, this is crap.

845
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,318
Rym: It's light cool edit, but it doesn't work the same

846
00:53:20,359 --> 00:53:20,500
Rym: way.".

847
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,298
Rym: And I had trouble with it.

848
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:25,120
Rym: But after an hour of using it, I'd figured out all the little differences.

849
00:53:25,882 --> 00:53:29,340
Rym: And aside from the little cosmetic differences, it was the same basic program.

850
00:53:29,923 --> 00:53:31,000
Rym: And I could do everything I needed.

851
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,700
Rym: When I used Audacity, after about five minutes, I was the master.

852
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:35,960
Rym: I could do anything in Audacity.

853
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:38,120
Scott: Audacity is kind of a good interface, actually.

854
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,260
Rym: Yeah, I prefer ReSound's interface.

855
00:53:40,862 --> 00:53:44,300
Rym: But then again, ReSound's a WAV editor, and Audacity is a multitrack editor.

856
00:53:44,481 --> 00:53:45,060
Rym: They're sequencer.

857
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:45,839
Rym: They're two different things.

858
00:53:47,481 --> 00:53:49,540
Rym: But GarageBand is just not intuitive.

859
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:51,880
Rym: I mean, ReSound is intuitive.

860
00:53:52,202 --> 00:53:57,060
Rym: If you know about audio, fiddling with it for an hour, you'll know everything there is to know about using ReSound.

861
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:58,371
Scott: Okay.

862
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,988
Scott: Adobe Audition 2.0 retail is $355 on Newegg.

863
00:54:03,761 --> 00:54:05,917
Rym: That's a lot of money for something I could buy for 70 bucks.

864
00:54:06,706 --> 00:54:06,940
Scott: Yep.

865
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:08,799
Rym: That does basically the same thing.

866
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:13,640
Rym: I mean, Adobe's added some stuff to it over the years, but I didn't need any of that.

867
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:13,980
Rym: Yeah.

868
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:24,879
Scott: But as for Rym not learning software, I refer specifically to the feed burner incident, where Rym set up the feed burner account, and I was like, "Make the feed burner account do

869
00:54:24,919 --> 00:54:25,040
Scott: this.".

870
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,940
Scott: Because he wouldn't let me do it, even though I know web stuff, and he doesn't.

871
00:54:28,121 --> 00:54:30,420
Rym: Even though I changed the password so he could just log into it.

872
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,820
Scott: Yeah, which I didn't, you know, you didn't tell me that until later.

873
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,320
Rym: Yeah, I think I did, and you forgot, or I said I told you.

874
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:35,663
Scott: Whatever.

875
00:54:35,744 --> 00:54:37,238
Scott: And then I was like, "Make it do

876
00:54:37,298 --> 00:54:37,460
Scott: this.".

877
00:54:37,561 --> 00:54:38,729
Scott: And you were like, "It can't do that.

878
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:39,294
Scott: It can't do that.

879
00:54:39,334 --> 00:54:39,757
Scott: It can't do

880
00:54:39,797 --> 00:54:39,938
Scott: that.".

881
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:45,618
Scott: I went over to it, and he logged in, and I pointed, and I said, "It's right there, you

882
00:54:45,639 --> 00:54:46,080
Scott: dumbass.".

883
00:54:46,785 --> 00:54:47,020
Rym: Yep.

884
00:54:49,222 --> 00:54:55,580
Scott: There is this one percent chance, I'm thinking, that Rym might just not be doing the obvious thing with GarageBand.

885
00:54:55,620 --> 00:55:00,780
Rym: However, I point out that it is verified that it can't make all these file formats I want.

886
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:12,939
Scott: That is true, and it's also true that after me, not using GarageBand, but searching on Google for help, wasn't able to find anything that was detailed information beyond Apple's lame-ass help.

887
00:55:13,661 --> 00:55:18,399
Rym: Yeah, now I don't want to talk more about GarageBand, because I have a lot of issues with OS X as well.

888
00:55:18,863 --> 00:55:18,977
Scott: Okay.

889
00:55:19,381 --> 00:55:20,659
Rym: And I'm going to go over these real briefly.

890
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:29,760
Rym: Point the first, Flash Audio randomly just doesn't work, which is a problem I had in Linux, and I bought a Mac because Macs just work, but it doesn't just work.

891
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:33,040
Scott: That was a problem I had when I was using Gen 2, and it was all crazy.

892
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:37,660
Scott: Now that I'm using the Ubuntu, I don't have that problem anymore, because I fixed all my Alsa audio.

893
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:47,397
Rym: So I searched around, and apparently a lot of OS X users are having this problem, and the solution that everyone gave me was run GarageBand and then close it, and that fixes it.

894
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:49,720
Rym: And sure enough it did, but what the hell?

895
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,580
Scott: Yeah, what kind of crazy problem is that?

896
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:54,340
Rym: Keep in mind, I haven't done anything weird to this Mac.

897
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,319
Rym: This is basically a straight from the Apple Store Mac.

898
00:55:58,302 --> 00:56:00,960
Rym: It shouldn't have a problem that glaring, especially on a Mac.

899
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,720
Rym: I could see that on a Windows box or a Linux box.

900
00:56:02,861 --> 00:56:05,980
Scott: I've heard about problems this glaring on Macs before.

901
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,999
Scott: Like there was that famous, you know, podcasting wubba wubba wubba issue.

902
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:18,399
Rym: Oh, speaking of wubba wubba wubba, one of the big selling features of GarageBand is that it has auto ducking like the radio uses.

903
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:25,819
Rym: Meaning, if I'm talking, or I'm playing say our opening music, as soon as I start talking, it'll duck the audio down underneath me.

904
00:56:26,361 --> 00:56:28,320
Rym: So you can hear what I'm saying, but the music's still playing.

905
00:56:28,661 --> 00:56:30,019
Rym: And when I stop talking, it comes back.

906
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:32,100
Rym: And GarageBand does this automatically.

907
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:32,879
Rym: It's this great thing.

908
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:37,380
Rym: Not only does it really not work so well, like it doesn't sound good.

909
00:56:37,862 --> 00:56:39,280
Rym: It sounds all right, but it's not great.

910
00:56:39,703 --> 00:56:42,160
Rym: You can't really customize it to make it sound better.

911
00:56:42,281 --> 00:56:43,980
Scott: It's pretty much ducking or not ducking.

912
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:44,819
Scott: Those are your choices.

913
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:55,360
Rym: And even the Apple documentation has been updated recently to say that many people find that they don't like the sound of our auto ducking.

914
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:57,800
Rym: And we recommend that you do it manually.

915
00:56:58,922 --> 00:57:02,480
Rym: So they realize from all the feedback they've gotten that it sucks.

916
00:57:02,901 --> 00:57:03,459
Scott: This is the thing.

917
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:07,620
Scott: If you want to wait for them to fix that, you're just going to be waiting and waiting and waiting.

918
00:57:08,002 --> 00:57:11,540
Scott: If you're using something open source, there would be a patch for that shit already.

919
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:14,380
Rym: Unless it's Audacity with that WXGTK bug.

920
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,158
Rym: That's right.

921
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:16,705
Scott: Yeah, that's the thing.

922
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:18,520
Scott: is Linux bugs are crazy.

923
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:33,380
Scott: It's like if you're using the Nvidia driver with an Enforce 2 integrated graphics processor on this specific version of Ubuntu without dual channeled memory running in your computer, then you will get random freezing.

924
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,960
Scott: It's crazy stuff like that.

925
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:42,079
Scott: It's never something so obvious like this program has a bug that occurs all the time because people fix that shit right away.

926
00:57:42,371 --> 00:57:42,560
Rym: Yep.

927
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:46,180
Rym: Unless it's like an unsupported program or someone's like beta pet project.

928
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:47,740
Rym: But yeah, you're not going to be right.

929
00:57:47,880 --> 00:58:01,180
Scott: But all the major, the Firefox is the audacity, the Ubuntu, the Gentoos, the Linux kernel itself, all of those giant open source projects will never have an issue as big as the one with GarageBand's auto ducking ever.

930
00:58:01,382 --> 00:58:01,580
Rym: All right.

931
00:58:02,002 --> 00:58:11,672
Rym: Now to keep getting away from GarageBand, the biggest issue I've had in terms of the Mac itself, now the OS X is great, but I bought the low end Mac Mini, the single core one.

932
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,439
Scott: The Intel Core Solo.

933
00:58:15,822 --> 00:58:16,468
Rym: With 512 megabytes of RAM.

934
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:21,020
Rym: It is massively faster than my Linux box.

935
00:58:21,601 --> 00:58:25,320
Rym: It encodes MP3s significantly slower than my Linux box.

936
00:58:25,661 --> 00:58:30,180
Rym: It mixes down to single track significantly slower than my Linux box.

937
00:58:31,282 --> 00:58:33,879
Rym: In general, it's slower than my Linux box.

938
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:55,200
Scott: Even if the software for those specific tasks was really inefficiently written, even if the software for those tasks is PVC software that has to go through Rosetta, Half Life 1 on Wine on Linux, which is essentially the equivalent of a Rosetta type of thing, is better.

939
00:58:55,542 --> 00:58:56,338
Scott: It's like, what the...

940
00:58:57,462 --> 00:59:04,020
Rym: I'm going to install Windows or Linux on this thing with Bootcamp just to see, but I have the sneaking suspicion that, well, I don't know.

941
00:59:04,341 --> 00:59:05,859
Rym: It should be really fast if I do that.

942
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:13,219
Scott: Yeah, because remember when Gabe from Penny Arcade, he did Bootcamp on his Mac to run World of Warcraft in Windows and Mac.

943
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:13,729
Scott: Ooh.

944
00:59:14,321 --> 00:59:15,520
Scott: And Mac to compare.

945
00:59:15,721 --> 00:59:16,298
Rym: I'm not editing that out.

946
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,480
Scott: We can't edit that verb out.

947
00:59:17,881 --> 00:59:22,959
Rym: I can, but I'm not going to, because I can't put markers... God, GarageBand in audacity.

948
00:59:24,203 --> 00:59:24,739
Rym: Don't resound.

949
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:26,200
Rym: I could just click.

950
00:59:27,122 --> 00:59:29,900
Rym: So while we're recording, if Scott coughed, I could click and there'd be a little queue.

951
00:59:30,606 --> 00:59:36,720
Scott: And then... That means that when we're done with the show, Rym can look at the show and there'll be these little red lines wherever he clicked.

952
00:59:37,101 --> 00:59:41,540
Scott: So he could just look and go straight to where the burps are, because there's little red lines on all of them.

953
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:41,755
Rym: Yep.

954
00:59:41,841 --> 00:59:43,199
Rym: Or I'll go and, why did I click there?

955
00:59:43,681 --> 00:59:48,120
Rym: Oh, because I coughed or my phone rang or, all right, I got to go edit that out.

956
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:49,879
Rym: Or we had a long pause because I...

957
00:59:50,262 --> 00:59:54,599
Scott: So we can remember where the spots that need editing, because he put little flags next to all of them.

958
00:59:55,481 --> 00:59:57,480
Rym: There's really no way to do that in GarageBand.

959
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:58,319
Scott: No way at all.

960
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:04,360
Rym: The best I can do is drag pictures onto the special AAC podcast track.

961
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:10,760
Scott: Or we can just, like, whenever something weird happens, we can shut up for 10 seconds to leave a bunch of silence as a marker.

962
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:11,580
Rym: But then I still have to do...

963
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:13,440
Scott: Or we can scream as a marker.

964
01:00:13,781 --> 01:00:15,960
Rym: Or I could make a sound that would play or something.

965
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:23,220
Rym: I could make a track that has sound effects that are silent, and then hit those, thereby having markers.

966
01:00:23,704 --> 01:00:27,079
Rym: But that's really a hackish... I shouldn't have to do something that hackish on a Mac.

967
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:27,920
Scott: No, you shouldn't.

968
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:29,319
Scott: It should be smooth and deadly.

969
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,780
Rym: But honestly, this computer is not fast enough for the software it has.

970
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:38,420
Rym: It slows... If I run GarageBand, everything else slows to a crawl.

971
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:45,140
Rym: If I open a whole bunch of tabs, it slows down more than my Linux box does when I open a bunch of tabs in Firefox.

972
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:50,520
Scott: Yeah, it's like the way they seem to be marketing these things is, the core solo is sufficient.

973
01:00:50,781 --> 01:00:52,960
Scott: Get the core duo if you want to be wicked fast.

974
01:00:53,122 --> 01:00:54,120
Scott: Crazy wicked fast.

975
01:00:54,524 --> 01:01:01,436
Scott: They didn't say, "Yeah, the core duo is pretty much what you need to go at a decent speed, and the core solo is just kind of if you're

976
01:01:01,457 --> 01:01:01,638
Scott: cheap.".

977
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:08,338
Rym: Yep, and after I looked around online, everyone said, "You have to have at least a gig of RAM, or GarageBand is crap and everything's

978
01:01:08,358 --> 01:01:08,560
Rym: crap.".

979
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:09,077
Rym: And you know what?

980
01:01:09,641 --> 01:01:12,160
Rym: An extra gig of RAM is a hundred bucks.

981
01:01:12,748 --> 01:01:12,939
Scott: Yep.

982
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:17,060
Rym: That immediately is not worth it, Well, at least if you buy it from Apple.

983
01:01:17,521 --> 01:01:23,159
Rym: Yeah, but if you don't buy it from Apple, it voids your warranty and all sorts of crap, and you got to get the special Mac RAM and stick it in there.

984
01:01:24,064 --> 01:01:26,339
Rym: And I got to figure out how to open this thing, which is really sleek.

985
01:01:26,541 --> 01:01:30,020
Rym: I like the physical case, but I don't feel comfortable tearing it open.

986
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:31,420
Scott: Yeah, you can go online.

987
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:32,879
Scott: There's some pictures of people opening it.

988
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:35,679
Rym: Yeah, I don't want to avoid the warranty, especially if I might return it.

989
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:36,439
Scott: Yeah, of course.

990
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:47,460
Scott: Personally, I added a wire to my car to do iPod integration via a wire instead of an FM transmitter, and now I'm completely fearless just ripping apart my dashboard.

991
01:01:48,302 --> 01:01:50,040
Scott: It's just plastic and it just rips right off.

992
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:50,497
Scott: It's great.

993
01:01:51,562 --> 01:01:54,500
Rym: Now, I've also had a lot of weird random issues.

994
01:01:54,700 --> 01:02:02,080
Rym: Like, I'll be using my computer with GarageBand and stuff open, and suddenly my dock will stop magnifying, and I can't make it do it again until I reboot.

995
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:03,109
Rym: Whoa.

996
01:02:03,541 --> 01:02:04,480
Rym: I shouldn't have to reboot.

997
01:02:04,581 --> 01:02:05,379
Rym: And I'm up to date.

998
01:02:05,881 --> 01:02:09,619
Rym: I went to the little OS X updater and updated everything as far as it could update.

999
01:02:11,445 --> 01:02:30,220
Rym: And just little things like that, little problems that I guess I was under the impression that Macs didn't have because they were so streamlined and polished, and that they were problems in Linux because Linux is kind of tough to make work, but I'm having more problems with my Mac than I do with my Linux box, except for iPod iTunes, which works perfectly.

1000
01:02:30,827 --> 01:02:31,039
Scott: Yep.

1001
01:02:31,501 --> 01:02:34,280
Rym: And actually chatting with ADM is really, really good.

1002
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:39,400
Scott: Yeah, I like the way ADM makes the chat boxes with the colors of the different people.

1003
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,400
Rym: Yeah, and Skype works fantastically.

1004
01:02:41,621 --> 01:02:44,220
Rym: I haven't used iChat much yet, but it looks really, really cool.

1005
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:55,900
Rym: In fact, we're most likely going to be interviewing Jim Vowles, the CEO, well, the head, the con chair of Oticon, this Wednesday, which we won't have that episode until next Wednesday, most likely.

1006
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:57,500
Scott: No, we're not going to do it this Wednesday?

1007
01:02:58,063 --> 01:02:58,660
Rym: I don't really want to.

1008
01:02:58,660 --> 01:02:59,480
Scott: I think we should do it right away.

1009
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,159
Scott: We can save our anime next.

1010
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,080
Scott: No one cares as much as Jim Vowles.

1011
01:03:03,341 --> 01:03:04,539
Rym: You know why I'm not going to do that?

1012
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:11,218
Rym: Because then I have to edit it that night in GarageBand, or export it to my Linux box and do it.

1013
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:28,180
Rym: Seriously, the biggest thing I can say is that I really keep having this urge to just turn on my Linux box and do the podcast, because I'll be able to just crank out a podcast with the same quality you guys are used to, which I don't know how today's will sound, but listen to all our previous episodes, and we have good quality.

1014
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:44,200
Scott: Yeah, I want everyone to go out there, take this episode, and take last Monday's episode, and listen to both of them, and listen to something that's exactly the same, like the opening and the closing, because it's the same audio, and tell us which one is better.

1015
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:55,619
Rym: Now, I'll point out that in terms of the special filters that GarageBand has built in, I looked at what they are, and I could just recreate those on my own for free and resound.

1016
01:03:56,608 --> 01:03:56,958
Scott: Why don't we?

1017
01:03:57,562 --> 01:03:58,539
Rym: I'm thinking of doing that.

1018
01:03:58,680 --> 01:03:59,300
Scott: That's a good idea.

1019
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:05,180
Rym: But I mean, I like my Apple, and if I weren't a podcaster, I'd love my Apple.

1020
01:04:05,821 --> 01:04:10,880
Rym: And it's weird to me that podcasting is the one thing I can't do on my Apple computer.

1021
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:16,360
Scott: Yeah, so all you podcasters out there, because they know a shit ton of podcasters do use GarageBand.

1022
01:04:16,682 --> 01:04:17,160
Rym: How are you doing?

1023
01:04:17,302 --> 01:04:18,840
Rym: Do you just deal with all that?

1024
01:04:19,381 --> 01:04:25,760
Scott: Do you not know that there are easier and better ways to do all these things, and you're just Apple hoes or what?

1025
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:41,760
Rym: I mean, I don't want to disparage Macs, because I really like this machine, but I'm really uncomfortable with Apple now that they're trying to force me to use their proprietary formats, and that I really feel that the processing power and abilities of the Mac Mini were grossly overstated by Apple.

1026
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:42,271
Scott: Yep.

1027
01:04:42,862 --> 01:05:03,020
Scott: I'm really just getting the feeling that a lot of the podcasters out there just don't know anything about audio, have never used a real audio-editing, wave-editing program before, so they don't know what they're missing, and they don't realize they've got complete shit, and that their lives are being made miserable, and that their editing times could be reduced to mere minutes, as opposed to the hours that they're spending.

1028
01:05:03,341 --> 01:05:04,260
Rym: Please tell me I'm wrong.

1029
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:05,679
Rym: Tell us there's something we don't know.

1030
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:09,820
Scott: Yes, I really want to know, because then we could use this thing and be all good.

1031
01:05:10,021 --> 01:05:25,979
Rym: If any of you live nearby, you know, anywhere in downstate New York, I wouldn't be opposed, if you're the GarageBand master, come over to our house, we'll do a show in GarageBand, and then you show us how to do it, and then we'll do a show in Audacity and Rezone, and we'll show you how we do it.

1032
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:30,360
Scott: Or at the least, I know that some of our listeners are podcasters who use GarageBand.

1033
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:36,499
Scott: We'll set up a time in Skype or iChat with you, and we can discuss, and you can teach us stuff.

1034
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,359
Rym: We'll also record it and put it on the show.

1035
01:05:38,721 --> 01:05:40,438
Scott: Yeah, maybe, depending on how good it is.

1036
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,080
Rym: I just, please tell me I'm wrong.

1037
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:52,640
Rym: I like my Mac, and we might well probably end up keeping it anyway, because GarageBand seems to be really good for doing a live show at a convention, mostly just because the Mac is really small and portable.

1038
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:56,540
Scott: And at a convention, you're not going to be editing and cutting and pasting.

1039
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:56,896
Rym: Nope.

1040
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,460
Rym: I mean, when we record a show at a convention, we don't edit it at all.

1041
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:03,280
Scott: We just push record, we wait, and we push stop, which is GarageBand perfect.

1042
01:06:03,561 --> 01:06:04,418
Scott: That's what they want you to do.

1043
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:05,060
Rym: Yep.

1044
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:11,680
Scott: Oh, one last thing is that the Mac Mini seems to be billed as the plug it into your TV living room computer.

1045
01:06:11,983 --> 01:06:13,000
Rym: It doesn't do that by default.

1046
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:13,820
Rym: You have to buy a dongle.

1047
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,018
Scott: You have to buy a dongle to plug it into the TV.

1048
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,929
Scott: It comes with a remote control.

1049
01:06:17,949 --> 01:06:19,740
Scott: that would be perfect with the front.

1050
01:06:20,909 --> 01:06:21,200
Rym: All right.

1051
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:23,680
Rym: You may be wondering what that abrupt cutoff was.

1052
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:26,720
Scott: Followed by a slight pause, which we left in to make you comfortable.

1053
01:06:28,703 --> 01:06:36,999
Rym: I pretty much just had it with Apple, because GarageBand decided just then that because I was out of RAM, and I looked, it had used up all of my RAM.

1054
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:38,630
Scott: More RAM than we had.

1055
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:40,339
Scott: It was swapping a little bit.

1056
01:06:40,582 --> 01:06:42,880
Rym: It refused to continue recording.

1057
01:06:43,122 --> 01:06:43,620
Rym: It just stopped.

1058
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:48,560
Rym: It didn't even give an error, or a warning, or a flashing red thing, or anything.

1059
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:50,700
Scott: Some people know how to write software these days.

1060
01:06:50,840 --> 01:07:06,720
Scott: If I wrote a program to record lots and lots of audio, I would keep maybe the latest, I don't know, minute or two of audio in RAM, and have all the old audio written to the disc, while I'm recording.

1061
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:11,477
Rym: In the very least, just have a thing that says, "You can't record longer than

1062
01:07:11,517 --> 01:07:11,678
Rym: this.".

1063
01:07:12,284 --> 01:07:14,293
Rym: Or have a thing that says, "You're about to run

1064
01:07:14,457 --> 01:07:14,559
Rym: out."

1065
01:07:14,641 --> 01:07:15,873
Rym: Or, "You can't record

1066
01:07:15,934 --> 01:07:16,259
Rym: anymore.".

1067
01:07:16,342 --> 01:07:17,773
Rym: Or, "Warning, I'm not recording

1068
01:07:17,813 --> 01:07:18,137
Rym: anymore.".

1069
01:07:18,504 --> 01:07:19,139
Rym: It just stopped.

1070
01:07:19,844 --> 01:07:25,660
Rym: The only reason we noticed it, is because I happened to look up at the computer, and see that it had just stopped recording, suddenly.

1071
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:33,940
Scott: If we hadn't looked at the Apple, like, we could have gone for a whole lot longer talking, and none of it would have been recorded, and we would have been pissed.

1072
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:34,999
Scott: Real pissed.

1073
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:35,470
Rym: Yeah.

1074
01:07:35,985 --> 01:07:51,420
Scott: And, so, I'm recording on my Linux box now, and right at this moment, the Apple is exporting the part of the show that you just listened to, to an AIFF file, and it's taking ludicrously large amounts of time.

1075
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:58,059
Rym: It's taking longer to do that on the super fast Mac, than it does- Relatively super fast Mac.

1076
01:07:58,762 --> 01:08:00,440
Rym: Super fast compared to my other computer.

1077
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:01,120
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

1078
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:04,200
Rym: Than my Linux computer takes to do something more complex.

1079
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:04,971
Scott: Yup.

1080
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:06,043
Rym: Yeah.

1081
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:07,190
Rym: Yeah.

1082
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:20,840
Rym: So apparently I can only ever record one hour, six minutes, and like 23 seconds of mono wave audio on GarageBand, without spending a hundred dollars to get more RAM.

1083
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:23,899
Scott: Now- Or buy a core duo processor, I guess.

1084
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:28,779
Rym: Now I want to point this out too, on my Linux box, has the same amount of RAM as this Mac, right?

1085
01:08:29,243 --> 01:08:30,038
Rym: It's just a lot slower.

1086
01:08:30,801 --> 01:08:36,799
Rym: I've recorded almost 900 megabytes in one go, and the Linux box didn't even hiccup.

1087
01:08:37,479 --> 01:08:49,620
Scott: I think that from a computer science perspective, that has a lot to do with the way the operating system manages memory, and the way the specific audio program itself is coded.

1088
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:57,238
Scott: Which means the reason we bought the Apple, is for the GarageBand software, and the operating system.

1089
01:08:58,023 --> 01:09:02,180
Scott: And those are the two factors here, both of which are negative.

1090
01:09:02,683 --> 01:09:07,938
Rym: We might end up keeping the Mac to do live shows, even though now- And be the living room PC.

1091
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:19,578
Rym: Even though now, if we do a live show that lasts longer than an hour, we're then going to have to stop recording, export to AIF for like 15 minutes, and entertain the crowd during that time, before we can record again.

1092
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:20,118
Rym: Yep.

1093
01:09:21,408 --> 01:09:21,598
Rym: Yeah.

1094
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:27,979
Scott: I'm sure that'll- You know, we should do that though on purpose, to be like, "Hey crowd, this is why you shouldn't podcast with Apple.

1095
01:09:28,102 --> 01:09:34,636
Scott: It's more expensive, and it's easier if you don't know what you're doing, or if you plan on doing something short, but if you plan on doing anything

1096
01:09:34,697 --> 01:09:34,920
Scott: real.".

1097
01:09:37,883 --> 01:09:40,120
Scott: And possibly something proprietary that costs money.

1098
01:09:40,621 --> 01:09:48,840
Rym: So at least for now, regardless of whether we keep the Mac or not, we're keeping it at least till Wednesday, because we're interviewing someone over iChat, and things like that might be reason enough to keep the Mac.

1099
01:09:48,901 --> 01:09:50,800
Scott: And that interview shouldn't go more than an hour.

1100
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:59,499
Rym: Of course, I've heard people have had a lot of trouble making iChat record properly in GarageBand, so I gotta test- Supposedly you just click a button.

1101
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:00,060
Rym: Yeah.

1102
01:10:00,281 --> 01:10:00,598
Scott: And it works.

1103
01:10:00,681 --> 01:10:02,080
Rym: I gotta test that tomorrow.

1104
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:02,897
Scott: Well, we'll find out.

1105
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:10,260
Rym: But yeah, as of now, today was the first, last, and only regular GeekNights episode that will be recorded in GarageBand.

1106
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:18,820
Scott: It just can't- Unless on the incredible off chance that someone comes to us and enlightens us in the ways of the band of Garage.

1107
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:21,460
Scott: And I'll say right now- Or as the Brits say, the garage.

1108
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:25,980
Rym: The answer to my current issue is not buy more RAM.

1109
01:10:26,324 --> 01:10:26,390
Scott: No.

1110
01:10:27,021 --> 01:10:31,420
Rym: Because more RAM costs $100, which means this computer now costs $700.

1111
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:41,920
Scott: For $700, we could've bought a PC with gigs and gigs and gigs of RAM that would've run Ubuntu, Dapper Drake- Ubuntu, Dapper Drake like a frickin' beast.

1112
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:43,320
Scott: Oh, it finally exported to iTunes.

1113
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:44,340
Rym: Yeah, alright.

1114
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:57,299
Rym: So now I've got to get all of these files off of my Mac onto my Linux box and Scott's Windows laptop so we can convert them to formats that you all can actually listen to as opposed to Apple proprietary cruft.

1115
01:10:57,895 --> 01:10:58,080
Scott: Yep.

1116
01:10:59,121 --> 01:11:02,319
Rym: Um, really, I implore you, tell us we're wrong.

1117
01:11:03,281 --> 01:11:13,240
Rym: You're not gonna hear any more GarageBand episodes except possibly interviews with people over Skype and iTunes or iChat and possibly live convention shows.

1118
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:16,760
Scott: Or possibly short tidbits when real lazy and don't care.

1119
01:11:17,424 --> 01:11:17,699
Rym: Yeah.

1120
01:11:18,641 --> 01:11:19,439
Rym: Alright, we're done now.

1121
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:28,060
Rym: We've done a long episode and I'm actually really angry at my Mac right now for the fact that I have to stay up for another hour or two to do all this stuff just to put a podcast up.

1122
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:31,957
Scott: Well, for once I have to stay up also because I have to convert the damn whatnots.

1123
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:34,320
Rym: Yeah, and while he's converting I'll be doing other things.

1124
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:34,820
Scott: Yep.

1125
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:35,717
Rym: But you know what?

1126
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:42,320
Rym: Just now I've realized I'm using my Linux box again and it's so much slicker at doing a podcast.

1127
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:43,760
Rym: It's so much easier.

1128
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:44,719
Rym: It's so much quicker.

1129
01:11:46,102 --> 01:11:48,000
Rym: I'm sorry to all of you who wanted me to use a Mac.

1130
01:11:48,141 --> 01:11:49,058
Rym: I really wanted to.

1131
01:11:49,522 --> 01:11:50,739
Rym: I really like the Mac.

1132
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:54,000
Rym: But GarageBand is, as far as I'm concerned, crap.

1133
01:11:55,284 --> 01:11:55,693
Scott: Uh, yeah.

1134
01:11:56,748 --> 01:11:57,159
Scott: I'll try.

1135
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:01,440
Scott: I gotta try it once, possibly this week, just to make sure Rym isn't smoking some drugs.

1136
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:03,540
Scott: But I just saw it stop recording.

1137
01:12:03,946 --> 01:12:04,117
Rym: Yeah.

1138
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:04,897
Rym: And that's all.

1139
01:12:06,223 --> 01:12:06,811
Scott: There's no doubt.

1140
01:12:10,302 --> 01:12:12,020
Rym: Alright, we're done tonight.

1141
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,160
Rym: Hopefully we'll be less angry tomorrow.

1142
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:16,739
Rym: Well, we will be because I'll be recording in my Linux box, which is easy.

1143
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:18,139
Scott: And we'll be talking about some games.

1144
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:18,709
Rym: Yep.

1145
01:12:25,912 --> 01:12:28,010
Rym: And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1146
01:12:28,292 --> 01:12:30,629
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

1147
01:12:31,130 --> 01:12:35,449
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontrowcrew.com.

1148
01:12:36,170 --> 01:12:38,510
Scott: If you like our podcasts, you'll love our forums.

1149
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:39,446
Scott: Make sure you visit them.

1150
01:12:40,030 --> 01:12:43,450
Scott: You can send your email feedback to geeknights@gmail.com.

1151
01:12:43,990 --> 01:12:46,097
Scott: And if you want, you can leave us a voicemail at 206-333-1537.

1152
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:53,530
Rym: GeekNights airs every weeknight, Monday through Thursday.

1153
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:57,470
Scott: GeekNights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

1154
01:12:58,211 --> 01:13:01,370
Scott: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
