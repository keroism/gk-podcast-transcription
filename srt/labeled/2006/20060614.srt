00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,683
Rym: It's Wednesday June 14th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,723 --> 00:00:17,089
Rym: We bring you our coverage of the mocha art festival Which we attended this past weekend.

3
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:18,987
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,708
Rym: It's real hard to do the show now that I have a Mac, and I just want to play with it all day.

5
00:00:25,974 --> 00:00:26,865
Scott: I thought what happened to?

6
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,577
Scott: Only I teased my job.

7
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:30,882
Scott: I only do it for the money.

8
00:00:30,923 --> 00:00:31,826
Scott: I don't like computers.

9
00:00:32,268 --> 00:00:33,592
Rym: Eh I Like the.

10
00:00:33,692 --> 00:00:36,950
Rym: I like the things I can do with the Mac, and I haven't even gotten to explore it yet.

11
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,889
Rym: There's all these little applications that do things and I haven't been able to do them yet.

12
00:00:40,811 --> 00:00:41,593
Scott: What happened to?

13
00:00:41,614 --> 00:00:42,798
Scott: I hate computers?

14
00:00:42,818 --> 00:00:44,142
Scott: I only do IT for the money.

15
00:00:44,162 --> 00:00:45,708
Rym: I'd only do IT for the money.

16
00:00:45,768 --> 00:00:46,209
Rym: I hate IT.

17
00:00:47,111 --> 00:00:50,889
Scott: Yet you seem to be having a lot of fun doing some IT in your house.

18
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:53,990
Rym: No, no see the thing is I don't like working for other people.

19
00:00:54,552 --> 00:00:56,558
Rym: I don't like doing the work that come.

20
00:00:56,678 --> 00:01:00,710
Rym: anything that people will pay me to do with few exceptions are things that I believe.

21
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:07,969
Scott: That when you said that you only did IT for the money You were saying how you didn't care about your computer and bla bla bla bla bla.

22
00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:10,079
Rym: now I was talking mostly about on a global scale.

23
00:01:10,139 --> 00:01:12,249
Rym: I don't care so much about computers and IT.

24
00:01:12,451 --> 00:01:13,986
Rym: I care a lot more about what they can do.

25
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:20,070
Scott: and I'm really but it was a discussion about me trying to get you to buy a new computer that which you desperately needed.

26
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:24,038
Scott: So you're arguing against buying a new computer.

27
00:01:24,058 --> 00:01:27,688
Scott: well considering that you didn't want one yet, and you're now turncoat.

28
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:29,957
Rym: Well, I didn't so desperately need it.

29
00:01:29,997 --> 00:01:34,970
Rym: considering that I'm still recording the podcast on my old Linux box It's about the only thing you're doing in the old Linux box.

30
00:01:35,091 --> 00:01:37,190
Scott: That's only cuz you didn't figure out how to use garage band yet.

31
00:01:37,512 --> 00:01:41,239
Rym: Yeah, I got to do a lot of stuff to make garage band do what I want it to do Mm-hmm.

32
00:01:42,492 --> 00:01:50,041
Scott: But yeah, I was right again okay, and speaking of Computers I got some steam to go in my Ubuntu.

33
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,570
Rym: Yeah, though apparently half-life 2 is slow as shit.

34
00:01:52,952 --> 00:01:53,736
Scott: Well, I don't know.

35
00:01:54,098 --> 00:01:56,389
Scott: It's I'm gonna restart and try it one more time.

36
00:01:57,116 --> 00:02:02,260
Scott: It worked like it ran But half-life 1 ran super smooth like perfect.

37
00:02:02,701 --> 00:02:05,690
Scott: half-life 2 didn't run so super smooth in the first go.

38
00:02:05,851 --> 00:02:09,336
Scott: So I'm gonna give it one more go to see what happens With.

39
00:02:09,376 --> 00:02:11,349
Rym: are you gonna change anything before you give it another go?

40
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:13,035
Scott: I did.

41
00:02:13,095 --> 00:02:14,510
Scott: I changed some X config stuff.

42
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,275
Scott: Okay I didn't wasn't applied.

43
00:02:16,596 --> 00:02:18,342
Rym: as long as you're not one of those people has a problem.

44
00:02:18,703 --> 00:02:23,222
Rym: and then they tried the exact same thing over And over again and wonder why the exact same thing happens over.

45
00:02:23,302 --> 00:02:29,070
Scott: also when I did try half-life 2 I was a bit hasty and I you know push some buttons that might have screwed it up.

46
00:02:30,831 --> 00:02:34,665
Scott: So I'm gonna not push those buttons this time and we'll see what happens.

47
00:02:34,685 --> 00:02:35,910
Scott: a little more patience.

48
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,976
Rym: so Yeah, we got some news though.

49
00:02:40,398 --> 00:02:41,221
Scott: Oh, we do have news.

50
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:54,270
Rym: the RIAA the Long-standing enemy of all that is good and holy Has been doing you know the typical bad thing suing people trying to extend copyright or screw copyright up hurting artists and generally being evil.

51
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,621
Rym: They recently just stated that they're not worried anymore.

52
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:05,988
Rym: They've got peer-to-peer contained and I Just started cracking up and I didn't even read the rest of it.

53
00:03:07,652 --> 00:03:08,697
Scott: They said that it door.

54
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:14,057
Rym: They said that piracy is not hurting sales anymore And then you can stop suing people.

55
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:16,806
Rym: and they said that downloads have peaked.

56
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:17,910
Rym: they flattened out.

57
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:26,689
Scott: They're not growing anymore to which the Pirate Bay getting a hajillion visitors Three times the more than what it got before people knew about it.

58
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:31,870
Rym: Well consider this the this is the first time the RIAA has lost so spectacularly.

59
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,014
Rym: I mean the Pirates Bay.

60
00:03:33,455 --> 00:03:40,479
Rym: not only did they flagrantly flaunt the fact that they were being awesome for For year for just constantly there.

61
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:41,181
Rym: No one could get him.

62
00:03:41,683 --> 00:03:42,425
Rym: No one could sue him.

63
00:03:42,747 --> 00:03:43,670
Rym: They were perfectly immune.

64
00:03:44,413 --> 00:03:54,990
Rym: They finally got gotten once and within three days They're back online fully operational and more popular than ever and they're also back up in their original country.

65
00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:00,067
Scott: So even though they were able to run away to other countries and now they're back up where they started.

66
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:01,030
Scott: Nothing has changed.

67
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:09,387
Rym: Now for any of you geeks out there who know how to do this I highly recommend you to a reverse DNS lookup of the Pirates Bay IP address.

68
00:04:09,848 --> 00:04:11,956
Rym: Mm-hmm It is quite hilarious.

69
00:04:12,317 --> 00:04:13,340
Scott: It is quite hilarious.

70
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:14,725
Scott: Hey, it has been terrific.

71
00:04:14,926 --> 00:04:23,405
Scott: I Also want to say, you know The RA does sort of have a point in that in the early days the Napster days.

72
00:04:23,445 --> 00:04:24,408
Scott: They win MX days.

73
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:33,637
Scott: I was Honestly pirating songs from them, you know constantly now Songs that my dad has on vinyl.

74
00:04:33,677 --> 00:04:34,700
Scott: so it kind of isn't.

75
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,364
Scott: it's okay kinda sorta.

76
00:04:36,806 --> 00:04:38,069
Rym: Yeah kind of sort of not really.

77
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:42,664
Scott: but The point is is that for the past?

78
00:04:42,945 --> 00:04:43,327
Scott: I don't know.

79
00:04:43,407 --> 00:04:45,273
Scott: three years There haven't?

80
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:49,104
Scott: I've already got every RIAA song I want.

81
00:04:49,225 --> 00:04:51,010
Scott: I'm not pirating their music anymore.

82
00:04:51,231 --> 00:04:54,342
Rym: there isn't so much new good music at least in our opinion.

83
00:04:54,442 --> 00:05:06,970
Scott: all the music that I'm getting now is Free music that I hear on podcasts that play free music or foreign music That's not technically illegal to foreign music that I can't obtain legally.

84
00:05:07,471 --> 00:05:13,108
Rym: So well, you could you could no don't pretend not for a reasonable price.

85
00:05:13,168 --> 00:05:13,469
Rym: Okay?

86
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:17,205
Rym: Okay there I'll give you that but don't say oh, I can't get that Japanese music.

87
00:05:17,245 --> 00:05:17,687
Rym: You can't.

88
00:05:17,727 --> 00:05:21,035
Rym: it's just $40 $40 like 50 bucks.

89
00:05:21,235 --> 00:05:22,720
Scott: Yes, screw that now.

90
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,325
Rym: I saw some discounts in that amazement.

91
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,007
Rym: I saw some $35 to make.

92
00:05:25,047 --> 00:05:35,320
Scott: see Oh $35 to me, you know, honestly though if the tables of CDs at the cons We're selling the Japanese CDs for five bucks.

93
00:05:35,681 --> 00:05:37,890
Scott: I'd probably buy a bunch of them hell even for ten bucks.

94
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:42,670
Scott: There are a few CDs I would have bought, you know, cuz while I can I get a lot of them on bit torrent.

95
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:45,119
Scott: There there's some that I just can't get.

96
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,010
Scott: they're so old or nobody's bothered to buy them at all.

97
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,876
Scott: So you can't get him now.

98
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:50,277
Scott: five bucks.

99
00:05:50,318 --> 00:05:53,288
Rym: my early Napster days downloading experience was quite different.

100
00:05:53,328 --> 00:05:54,956
Rym: in that one I had broadband right away.

101
00:05:54,996 --> 00:05:59,119
Rym: Like I was downloading mp3s before Napster even existed But I didn't.

102
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:00,490
Rym: I mean I like music.

103
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:14,850
Rym: But the only music I had were CDs that other people had bought me because I just as much as I enjoyed music I could never bring myself to spend my what I don't want to say hard-earned because I didn't earn it but spend the money I had on music on CDs.

104
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:21,529
Rym: So I go to concerts a lot and I'd get music and I'd go see like bands play and people would give me CDs.

105
00:06:22,432 --> 00:06:27,670
Rym: But I never bought music and as a result, I mostly only liked classical music and classic rock.

106
00:06:28,492 --> 00:06:35,148
Scott: Yeah, I bought music in the high school days before I broadband at least before I had brought that.

107
00:06:35,188 --> 00:06:35,890
Rym: I never bought music.

108
00:06:36,134 --> 00:06:36,889
Rym: Yeah my whole life.

109
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:40,663
Scott: But all the music I bought was always me ripping off Columbia House.

110
00:06:40,823 --> 00:06:42,770
Scott: people always said Columbia House is a ripoff.

111
00:06:43,535 --> 00:06:45,329
Scott: I figured out the way to beat Columbia House.

112
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:58,929
Scott: Occasionally, they would send these little tiny pieces of paper You had to be real clever to look for him that you would just put in a number and get a free CD and I would always calculate how much money I had given Columbia House and how many CDs I had gotten.

113
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:05,109
Scott: and By the time I was done with Columbia House, I just stopped paying attention to them, you know.

114
00:07:05,973 --> 00:07:11,804
Scott: And it turned out I paid something like four dollars for every CD I got from them For all the free ones they gave me.

115
00:07:11,904 --> 00:07:12,670
Scott: so that was you know.

116
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:17,363
Scott: And then I also got like a box set of CDs for like ten bucks.

117
00:07:17,764 --> 00:07:20,886
Scott: It's like a hundred bucks in the store stuff like that.

118
00:07:21,832 --> 00:07:36,314
Rym: But yeah, yep, but anyway once I discovered that I could download music online I in short order became very interested in a lot of foreign music and a lot of awesome music and my music tastes quintupled.

119
00:07:36,475 --> 00:07:40,581
Rym: I immediately expanded in a million directions and Well, the rest is history.

120
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:41,629
Scott: Mm-hmm.

121
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:50,601
Scott: So yeah, the oh, hey the reason if the RA has any truth in their recent statements It's the fact that no one cares about their music anymore.

122
00:07:50,621 --> 00:07:53,030
Scott: So no one's pirating it anymore, which I wouldn't be surprised.

123
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,761
Rym: There's a lot of good free music out there.

124
00:07:55,164 --> 00:07:55,386
Scott: Yep.

125
00:07:55,869 --> 00:08:07,450
Rym: Yep Yep, as I'm discovering more and more now that I have an iPod to listen to various podcasts on my way to work Yay Finally you're probably the only podcaster who didn't listen to podcast until now.

126
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:08,473
Rym: I have listened.

127
00:08:08,573 --> 00:08:12,907
Rym: I've currently listened to a grand total of six podcast episodes.

128
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:21,299
Rym: Holy crap I listened to two anime world orders way back because one I met him and they were cool and then they wanted some help with The Odean episode.

129
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,510
Rym: No, I did not but I it's going on.

130
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,305
Rym: Well, actually it's finished now because the iPods really fast, but it's on my iPod right now.

131
00:08:27,606 --> 00:08:28,590
Scott: It's a hilarious episode.

132
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:36,330
Rym: Oh Okay, I do know it's sad that now I found out that the Odean that I saw was in fact the shortened version.

133
00:08:36,592 --> 00:08:38,044
Rym: Yes, I can't imagine.

134
00:08:38,063 --> 00:08:44,820
Rym: I even imagine okay, so And I listened to a pen, you know pen radio.

135
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,367
Scott: Yeah, that's not technically a hundred percent podcast.

136
00:08:47,448 --> 00:08:47,869
Scott: It's a podcast.

137
00:08:48,451 --> 00:08:49,775
Rym: I used to listen to it on the radio.

138
00:08:49,976 --> 00:08:50,217
Scott: Yep.

139
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:56,708
Rym: Yep, and I downloaded one of artist Ally because Nury over there also asked for some audio help early on.

140
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:03,051
Rym: Yeah, seems that most of the podcast I downloaded because people asked me to listen to them and tell them how to make it sound Better.

141
00:09:03,071 --> 00:09:04,276
Scott: Yeah, that's good.

142
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:05,401
Rym: Now.

143
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:06,546
Rym: I listen to almost everything.

144
00:09:06,727 --> 00:09:11,574
Scott: Hooray Okay, my news It's a comic news.

145
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:12,437
Scott: Holy crap.

146
00:09:12,477 --> 00:09:13,621
Rym: Whoa on comic day.

147
00:09:13,782 --> 00:09:14,745
Rym: Yeah, what the hell?

148
00:09:14,986 --> 00:09:15,408
Scott: I don't know.

149
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:21,521
Scott: It's crazy now And I don't really care about superhero comics.

150
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,224
Scott: neither is Rym.

151
00:09:22,545 --> 00:09:23,950
Rym: you mean underwear pervert comics.

152
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,329
Scott: Yeah, that's right underwear perverts.

153
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:38,589
Scott: But if you care about underwear perverts the Marvel underwear perverts and you haven't read that Civil War whatever comic that came out today You probably want to fast-forward a bit because I'm gonna spoil the fuck out of it.

154
00:09:38,991 --> 00:09:41,839
Rym: All right, so fast forward until the thing of the day.

155
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:44,507
Rym: music unless you don't care about underwear perverts.

156
00:09:44,788 --> 00:09:49,009
Scott: Yep now Unless you want to laugh a whole lot cuz I'm gonna make fun of underwear perverts a lot.

157
00:09:49,452 --> 00:09:54,750
Scott: This might be hilarious Boon - so first I'm gonna explain to you the deal with the Civil War thing.

158
00:09:55,091 --> 00:09:59,130
Scott: I'm gonna in as short as possible because I personally don't even understand it that well.

159
00:09:59,271 --> 00:10:00,299
Scott: And I read the first issue.

160
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:08,550
Rym: from what little I've heard It sounds like it would kind of maybe be a neat concept in any other genre of literature.

161
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:16,910
Scott: Yeah, so what they've done is they're trying to make An analogy a metaphor of the current political situation in the u.s.

162
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:23,226
Scott: The you know privacy and civil civil liberties versus security issue.

163
00:10:23,526 --> 00:10:35,684
Scott: and what they've done is they said They took all the superheroes in the Marvel Universe, at least the ones on earth the ones that make sense Not the awesome ones in space Silver-surfer, I think this little runner.

164
00:10:35,704 --> 00:10:37,070
Scott: Oh, yeah, the Silver Surfer is not there.

165
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:39,982
Scott: There's a separate thing going on in space that he's doing what?

166
00:10:40,464 --> 00:10:42,030
Rym: how could the Civil War on earth of anything?

167
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:42,672
Scott: It's not it's.

168
00:10:42,773 --> 00:10:44,161
Scott: it's something else called annihilation.

169
00:10:44,322 --> 00:10:45,590
Scott: Okay, which I know nothing about.

170
00:10:46,491 --> 00:11:00,570
Scott: So all right, all I know is that it exists, but the Civil War storyline the major event is that the government of the United States of the world or what I don't even know is Saying that superheroes are dangerous.

171
00:11:00,631 --> 00:11:13,709
Scott: They're unlicensed Vigilantes and you know a few superheroes who are on who are making a reality TV show about themselves living it all together in a house You know do some damage and destroy a neighborhood and people get killed and it's bad.

172
00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:22,010
Scott: So the government's gonna pass a law that says superheroes have to register and get licensed and reveal their identities and all this.

173
00:11:22,211 --> 00:11:22,856
Scott: You know stuff.

174
00:11:23,098 --> 00:11:25,831
Scott: so that there aren't dangerous Superhero.

175
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,620
Scott: you can't go superheroing unless the government approves you.

176
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:31,630
Scott: that way there's liability and all that jazz.

177
00:11:32,071 --> 00:11:35,783
Rym: Yeah, so I guess if you've seen The Incredibles, I don't know.

178
00:11:35,803 --> 00:11:36,746
Scott: I never saw that.

179
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,914
Rym: It's actually a really good movie I know but I got it.

180
00:11:39,295 --> 00:11:43,030
Scott: It's weird because I know all those Pixar movies are good, but I haven't seen any sin.

181
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,788
Rym: honestly, I hadn't seen many of them either.

182
00:11:45,808 --> 00:11:50,206
Rym: and Emily who discovered this to be a travesty and after I saw many of them.

183
00:11:50,226 --> 00:11:54,866
Rym: I agreed with her Basically sat me down every chance you got and showed me almost all of them in order.

184
00:11:54,886 --> 00:11:55,890
Scott: Yeah, it's not a story.

185
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:59,422
Scott: Yeah, I didn't see Toy Story 2.

186
00:11:59,422 --> 00:12:00,506
Scott: I didn't see Monsters Inc.

187
00:12:00,546 --> 00:12:01,670
Scott: I didn't see the one with the fish.

188
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,659
Scott: I didn't see the new one with the cars.

189
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,161
Scott: fine.

190
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:05,005
Rym: It was okay.

191
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,210
Scott: I didn't see The Incredibles.

192
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:08,540
Rym: I didn't see The Incredibles is the best one.

193
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:09,424
Scott: What else is there?

194
00:12:09,444 --> 00:12:14,226
Scott: I Know I kind of want to see him, but I just have it and you know, I'll put them all in the queue.

195
00:12:14,387 --> 00:12:17,798
Rym: All right The point is I think the queue is full.

196
00:12:17,858 --> 00:12:18,159
Rym: Actually.

197
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:18,701
Rym: I got a look.

198
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:19,043
Scott: Yeah.

199
00:12:19,485 --> 00:12:20,830
Scott: Wow, you can fill a queue in Netflix.

200
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,418
Rym: It can only hold 500 per queue.

201
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:22,821
Scott: Whoa.

202
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:23,203
Scott: Okay.

203
00:12:23,223 --> 00:12:33,912
Scott: So anyway, the Civil War thing is Basically, they're trying to make a talk they're trying to make a comic about the politics of the real world by having similar politics in the Marvel Universe and having a Big deal out of it.

204
00:12:34,775 --> 00:12:39,310
Scott: and what they've done is they had this big shtick and the shtick is what side are you on?

205
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,316
Scott: You know and there's the Captain America side.

206
00:12:41,356 --> 00:12:42,018
Scott: That's all freedom.

207
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:42,841
Scott: That's the good side.

208
00:12:43,302 --> 00:12:45,750
Scott: And then there's the spider-man Iron Man side.

209
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:46,295
Scott: That's all.

210
00:12:46,637 --> 00:12:48,069
Scott: everyone better get licensed girl.

211
00:12:49,052 --> 00:12:58,246
Scott: So in the comic that came out today Civil War number two Spider-man went to I think did it said Times Square and those he had a big press conference.

212
00:12:58,286 --> 00:12:58,847
Scott: He said look at me.

213
00:12:58,867 --> 00:12:59,509
Scott: I'm Peter Parker.

214
00:13:02,254 --> 00:13:05,527
Rym: So, I guess we just spoiled the fact that Spider-man is Peter Parker.

215
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,580
Scott: Well, the point is that he told the world.

216
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:20,818
Scott: Yeah, the issue behind it is that you know Oh, he didn't he didn't want to do it because then people would know, you know Mary Jane and Aunt May and all his relatives, you know People could go to them and before they couldn't.

217
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:23,267
Scott: before and May was just some old lady.

218
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:29,500
Scott: now She's you know spider-man's aunt who can be kidnapped and used to control spider-man.

219
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:38,430
Scott: So Regardless of that what I want to talk about is a the fanboys who are all like some of them go.

220
00:13:39,293 --> 00:13:41,219
Scott: Oh, this is a travesty blah blah blah.

221
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:46,247
Scott: You can't do this state, you know the old guys back name You know, they can all shut up.

222
00:13:47,392 --> 00:13:49,321
Rym: Yeah, we don't need no small faction here.

223
00:13:49,502 --> 00:13:49,985
Scott: That's right.

224
00:13:50,527 --> 00:13:53,616
Scott: And number two Superhero comics.

225
00:13:53,697 --> 00:14:04,137
Scott: now if you look at this They're just the exact same thing you see on primetime TV all those sitcom things, you know, and all those HBO TV shows.

226
00:14:04,599 --> 00:14:06,748
Scott: these superhero comics are the same bullshit.

227
00:14:06,788 --> 00:14:18,160
Rym: now bear in mind We're talking specifically about a comic you would call a superhero comic not like I don't know ex-mock Mostly the Marvel and DC Universe Comics, I mean there are comics that involve beings.

228
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,869
Rym: you would you could call superheroes that are good.

229
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:23,603
Rym: These are underwear pervert comics.

230
00:14:23,884 --> 00:14:31,147
Scott: Yes underwear perverts more and more obvious every day that they're writing the underwear pervert comics as if they were.

231
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,354
Scott: you know Television shows.

232
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:34,758
Rym: I mean, I guess it's just.

233
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,510
Rym: it's like they don't want to give up on the fact that they have underwear perverts.

234
00:14:38,892 --> 00:14:39,876
Rym: This is a good story.

235
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,989
Rym: Why don't they just make original characters and do a comic about that?

236
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,470
Rym: Yep, or make you make up superheroes.

237
00:14:45,711 --> 00:14:49,039
Rym: Why keep using the same underwear perverts over and over again?

238
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:53,430
Scott: And why do you have to you know, keep this universe, you know?

239
00:14:54,170 --> 00:15:01,090
Scott: Make everything follow everything else and you have all this history and you have to like stick by and be all consistent and continuous.

240
00:15:01,512 --> 00:15:02,396
Scott: Why do you have to do that?

241
00:15:02,436 --> 00:15:05,170
Scott: The only people who care about that are the fanboys reading your shit.

242
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:13,310
Scott: You know what if you if you if you'd stop doing it the fanboys might get pissed But they're gonna buy it no matter what their fanboys.

243
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:25,310
Scott: you could print a picture of a piece of poop and put you know Amazing Spider-Man number whatever on the cover and They'll buy it because they have to have every single issue of Amazing Spider-Man no matter what's inside because they're fanboys.

244
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:36,232
Scott: so you might as well make the content of the comic something that everyone in the world can enjoy and Not forcing yourselves to make something that fanboys will enjoy and you'll.

245
00:15:36,252 --> 00:15:39,300
Scott: maybe you'll sell more copies and make something interesting.

246
00:15:39,762 --> 00:15:43,140
Rym: Maybe the problem is I mean it was mostly rhetorical question.

247
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:47,218
Rym: We know the answer and it's that they're milking money out of these underwear pervert fans.

248
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:51,534
Scott: Yep It just instead of getting more fans with the Nintendo strategy.

249
00:15:51,774 --> 00:15:54,083
Scott: Hey, you know Nintendo We don't know.

250
00:15:54,143 --> 00:15:55,851
Rym: instead of blue ocean is what yellow ocean?

251
00:15:55,991 --> 00:15:57,920
Scott: Yeah, it's instead of blue ocean.

252
00:15:58,161 --> 00:16:02,120
Scott: Let's get all those people who aren't our customers to become our customers to make more money.

253
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:07,160
Scott: It's let's take our existing cut loyal customers and make them give us more money.

254
00:16:08,322 --> 00:16:10,957
Scott: Hey, let's milk them for as much as you possibly can.

255
00:16:10,977 --> 00:16:11,339
Rym: You know what?

256
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:12,919
Rym: No I think I know what the real reason is.

257
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:16,440
Rym: They have these underwear perverts and they're running them until their threadbare.

258
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,509
Rym: They're doing it for the same reason.

259
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:21,140
Rym: I wore that same pair of boxers for over a decade.

260
00:16:22,163 --> 00:16:30,860
Scott: the other problem is is that Back in the day the people writing the underwear pervert comics were writing it like it was their job.

261
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,915
Scott: I mean sure there were some people who weren't but for the most part.

262
00:16:33,955 --> 00:16:34,699
Scott: This is their job.

263
00:16:35,622 --> 00:16:41,480
Scott: The people nowadays writing the underwear pervert comics used to be the fanboys of the underwear pervert comics.

264
00:16:42,222 --> 00:16:46,174
Scott: It's imagine if we let the the otaku run the anime companies.

265
00:16:46,314 --> 00:16:47,959
Scott: What kind of anime would they produce?

266
00:16:49,101 --> 00:16:51,887
Scott: Gainax people It's Gainax.

267
00:16:52,229 --> 00:16:56,386
Scott: imagine if every Anime studio was Gainax.

268
00:16:56,487 --> 00:16:57,529
Rym: No, no, not just Gainax.

269
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:01,740
Rym: Imagine if every anime studio was the people who like to Gainax's stuff.

270
00:17:03,521 --> 00:17:05,608
Scott: Well, I guess there aren't isn't enough Gainax to go around.

271
00:17:05,627 --> 00:17:06,511
Scott: so yeah, you know.

272
00:17:06,531 --> 00:17:11,627
Scott: now imagine if every movie studio in You know all the whole u.s.

273
00:17:11,727 --> 00:17:15,079
Scott: Was run by those, you know film buffs.

274
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,416
Scott: Scary isn't it?

275
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:29,937
Rym: you know, I think it also might have something to do with just the passion of the artists and the the fact that a lot of comic at least underwear pervert comics are definitely all about the money and a distributed effort among a lot of people.

276
00:17:29,957 --> 00:17:39,261
Rym: and Then look at say all the cool indie comics out there now where it's basically one guy or a small group of people who are doing something because they want to do it and They're.

277
00:17:39,342 --> 00:17:42,780
Rym: they're getting enjoyment just out of making the comic and the fact that the comic is successful.

278
00:17:43,402 --> 00:17:54,240
Scott: From listening to a lot of interviews on podcasts with the people making the underwear pervert comics they seem to enjoy it and like doing it and You know, but they also have the money factor.

279
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:13,339
Scott: It's like the guys who the management is all about money and they hire a bunch of people who are all about fanboys To do it and as a result you have a the all the creators want to stick with the status quo Because that's their favorite thing in the world and all the managers who care about money Don't want to take any risks.

280
00:18:13,621 --> 00:18:18,880
Scott: So they stick with the status quo while the reality is that taking a risk is the way to make more money.

281
00:18:19,523 --> 00:18:42,366
Scott: but the creators don't want to do that because they're fanboys and the managers don't want to do it because it's taking a risk and you know, they're okay with that because they make all their money off the movies and It was in the end result is bad comics for everyone that you know have to rely on Cares.

282
00:18:42,427 --> 00:18:43,700
Scott: it's just whatever.

283
00:18:44,681 --> 00:18:48,940
Scott: Why'd you make a comic with an interesting story and not just some crazy event?

284
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:57,839
Rym: Well, the the important question is when he took his mask off and revealed everything to the world Did he bold every third word or not?

285
00:19:06,358 --> 00:19:08,126
Rym: ah Things of the day now.

286
00:19:08,286 --> 00:19:10,293
Rym: I'm a big fan of practical jokes.

287
00:19:10,654 --> 00:19:12,400
Scott: Everyone's a fan of practical jokes.

288
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,052
Rym: No, I know a lot of people who aren't well, you know what.

289
00:19:15,132 --> 00:19:16,780
Scott: we should pull some practical jokes on them.

290
00:19:17,101 --> 00:19:19,818
Rym: Yeah, we should or pranks if you will.

291
00:19:21,102 --> 00:19:26,800
Rym: Yeah, anyways, I like pranks, especially like tire irons leg pulling All right.

292
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:32,486
Rym: Now this I'm not a hundred percent sure if this wasn't staged But I don't care because it's hilarious.

293
00:19:32,526 --> 00:19:38,771
Rym: either way and if this is actually real which I'm leaning toward it being real It's a thousand times more hilarious.

294
00:19:39,033 --> 00:19:46,860
Rym: Yeah, it was pretty funny And if anything it's a very clever practical joke that could be fairly easily replicated for humorous results.

295
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:52,159
Rym: So there's a checkout counter at a grocery store somewhere and they've got.

296
00:19:52,239 --> 00:19:57,840
Rym: you know A lot of places have the security camera and then there's a TV and you can see yourself and everything on the security camera.

297
00:19:58,683 --> 00:19:59,440
Scott: Yep, I see that.

298
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:00,840
Scott: I wonder why they do that.

299
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,302
Scott: What's the point?

300
00:20:01,322 --> 00:20:01,764
Rym: you know why?

301
00:20:01,884 --> 00:20:02,025
Rym: cuz?

302
00:20:02,065 --> 00:20:10,520
Scott: then the person who might be thinking about stealing looks up and sees themselves on camera and goes Oh, no now that you can see where the edge of the camera is so they can avoid it and steal something off-screen.

303
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:11,544
Rym: Yeah that too.

304
00:20:11,564 --> 00:20:15,300
Rym: But the thing is there's usually more cameras that they don't show you where they point.

305
00:20:15,762 --> 00:20:17,470
Scott: That's a good idea, but you know, it's just.

306
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,957
Rym: they always want to have one camera.

307
00:20:18,977 --> 00:20:19,640
Rym: That's obvious.

308
00:20:20,282 --> 00:20:26,767
Rym: In fact, I saw a documentary a long time ago where they showed that in a lot of banks You know, you see security cameras on the ceiling.

309
00:20:27,068 --> 00:20:27,730
Scott: Most of them are fake.

310
00:20:27,891 --> 00:20:29,215
Rym: They're fake and the real ones are hidden.

311
00:20:29,235 --> 00:20:30,058
Rym: Mm-hmm.

312
00:20:30,841 --> 00:20:36,536
Rym: But anyway, so they've got this camera and they've got a guy dressed up as death with a scythe.

313
00:20:37,358 --> 00:20:38,938
Rym: and then they've got this old guy.

314
00:20:42,926 --> 00:20:43,858
Rym: Then there's this guy.

315
00:20:45,853 --> 00:20:57,720
Rym: three Ubuntu Who's standing there and They have it set up so that they can overlay the death onto the camera image.

316
00:20:58,021 --> 00:21:10,002
Rym: So the person standing there if they look up at the camera, they'll see themselves standing there Reacting normally and behind them is fucking death the cream Three.

317
00:21:10,507 --> 00:21:14,151
Rym: so the first lady is standing there and she's doing her stuff.

318
00:21:14,171 --> 00:21:17,705
Rym: she looks up and she does a double-take and she looks at the cameras.

319
00:21:17,725 --> 00:21:17,967
Rym: that can.

320
00:21:17,987 --> 00:21:27,525
Rym: she moves her head a little and she turns around and They've overlaid the death over this old dude standing there with a scythe Like he's gonna.

321
00:21:27,546 --> 00:21:31,346
Scott: when she looks behind her in the real world She sees an old guy with a scythe.

322
00:21:31,728 --> 00:21:39,820
Scott: when she looks at this television with the video camera on top of it She sees herself doing exactly what she would normally be doing on the camera.

323
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:41,340
Scott: So it's a real camera.

324
00:21:41,704 --> 00:21:51,301
Rym: But she sees death Where the old man was and her reaction is she stands there for a minute and then she just kind of like puts her head Down and rubs her eyes and looks up again Mm-hmm.

325
00:21:51,702 --> 00:21:58,900
Rym: The best is this is one guy and he just stands there staring at the camera breathing really heavily and looking really really nervous.

326
00:22:01,657 --> 00:22:08,080
Scott: I This wouldn't work on me or someone like, you know any rational person But all those people who actually might think death is real.

327
00:22:08,682 --> 00:22:09,004
Rym: I don't know.

328
00:22:09,024 --> 00:22:11,413
Rym: if I would probably give me a little double-take.

329
00:22:11,453 --> 00:22:17,000
Scott: before I assumed that there was a tech ball I would well I would look to make sure my eyes weren't screwed up first.

330
00:22:17,523 --> 00:22:19,899
Scott: Then I would look at the camera and then look at the guy.

331
00:22:20,542 --> 00:22:26,586
Scott: Then I would go and push the guy while looking at the camera and see if it does the same thing And if it didn't.

332
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:32,255
Rym: I would know there was a camera trick and that would be that yeah Props if they could pull it off with a mirror or something.

333
00:22:32,275 --> 00:22:34,748
Rym: Ooh You could do that with a mirror.

334
00:22:34,768 --> 00:22:36,034
Rym: that was actually a display.

335
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:42,236
Scott: once we get display technology They set up some sort of motion capture thing like those little VR suits on the guy.

336
00:22:42,357 --> 00:22:43,300
Scott: Oh man, there is clothes.

337
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,228
Scott: Oh man, that would be the best.

338
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:48,300
Scott: Oh man, cuz that that would fool me for even more minutes.

339
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:56,129
Scott: I'd like have to take the guys clothes off before The evidence is really piling up.

340
00:22:56,149 --> 00:22:58,059
Scott: Scott, you know what if I'm dead, what does it matter?

341
00:22:59,240 --> 00:22:59,782
Scott: It's dead.

342
00:23:00,484 --> 00:23:02,831
Scott: I mean what the different possibilities are.

343
00:23:02,972 --> 00:23:05,078
Scott: a it's a trick beads death and I'm dead.

344
00:23:05,158 --> 00:23:08,053
Rym: if it's death Just beat him at twister and get on your way.

345
00:23:08,074 --> 00:23:10,760
Scott: I Don't think there was a twister in that store.

346
00:23:11,866 --> 00:23:13,785
Rym: dumb dumb All right.

347
00:23:13,805 --> 00:23:14,549
Rym: So what you think of the day?

348
00:23:15,313 --> 00:23:17,365
Rym: All right, so Seth MacFarlane Why did I ask you?

349
00:23:17,485 --> 00:23:19,860
Rym: I watched it with you right before we did the show.

350
00:23:20,161 --> 00:23:24,918
Scott: Yeah, I'm just so used to the radio, you know, it's actually a relatively old thing of the day.

351
00:23:24,938 --> 00:23:31,080
Scott: by old I mean a few days old and I saw linked to it, but ever watched it until just now by delicious did.

352
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,156
Rym: Yeah, I saw a link to just the stewie portion of it.

353
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:34,920
Scott: Oh, really?

354
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,580
Scott: Anyway, Seth MacFarlane is the guy who made family guy and he also does a lot of the voices on Family Guy.

355
00:23:39,761 --> 00:23:44,036
Scott: And I think he also made that other show that people don't like What Eric and dad?

356
00:23:44,076 --> 00:23:55,500
Scott: Yeah anyway at Harvard there's the day before graduation he went there to do some sort of What are they motivational speech of some sort?

357
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,130
Rym: Yeah, the kind of speeches they always give a keynote I guess.

358
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:00,315
Scott: Yeah, something like that.

359
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:03,384
Scott: I don't know but For the first part.

360
00:24:03,424 --> 00:24:11,060
Scott: He talked as himself Seth MacFarlane and for the second third and fourth parts He talked his three different Family Guy voices.

361
00:24:12,204 --> 00:24:27,353
Scott: So it was as if Seth MacFarlane Peter Griffin Peter Griffin Stewie Griffin and Quagmire All four of those people showed any to give speeches to Harvard.

362
00:24:27,654 --> 00:24:28,497
Scott: it's pretty funny.

363
00:24:28,778 --> 00:24:29,340
Scott: you should watch it.

364
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:30,879
Rym: Yeah, it's definitely worth watching.

365
00:24:31,624 --> 00:24:34,080
Scott: Yeah, well, you don't even really need to watch it except to go.

366
00:24:34,221 --> 00:24:35,650
Scott: Oh, that's what Seth MacFarlane looks like.

367
00:24:35,811 --> 00:24:37,099
Scott: the rest of the time you can just listen to.

368
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:39,691
Rym: yeah I did actually just because I didn't actually see it.

369
00:24:39,731 --> 00:24:46,438
Rym: I just listened to it while Scott watched it and As long as I didn't see him, I just assumed that Peter Griffin was standing up on that stage.

370
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:55,419
Scott: yep Someone should Remix this video, but with a little by putting Peter Griffin and Stewie up there and animating their mouth.

371
00:24:58,294 --> 00:25:07,758
Rym: Katie Yeah, it's kind of scary But I got kind of good at saying giga because you practiced it Partly because it's just double and triple tonguing like I used to do when I play the trumpet.

372
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:11,409
Scott: yeah You couldn't do it when you first tried.

373
00:25:11,489 --> 00:25:12,693
Rym: no I did practice a little bit.

374
00:25:12,834 --> 00:25:14,499
Scott: you practiced for many days.

375
00:25:15,402 --> 00:25:16,926
Scott: You know what increase your giga tees.

376
00:25:17,006 --> 00:25:18,129
Rym: It's a valuable skill.

377
00:25:18,831 --> 00:25:19,614
Scott: I'm sure it is.

378
00:25:19,714 --> 00:25:20,436
Rym: It'll get me far in life.

379
00:25:20,456 --> 00:25:23,287
Rym: Yep All right, Katie.

380
00:25:23,629 --> 00:25:28,749
Rym: Okay, so we're going to To this week this past weekend.

381
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:32,000
Rym: We went to it not really convention, but close enough.

382
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:36,360
Rym: So we're treating it like one the fifth annual mocha art festival in Manhattan.

383
00:25:36,923 --> 00:25:45,338
Scott: If you don't know the mocha is the Museum of Comic and cartoon art and it's a museum in the city and you can go visit it and you can join it.

384
00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:48,009
Scott: if you join It you get all kinds of goodies and it doesn't cost that much.

385
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:49,978
Scott: Yeah, I think I might actually join it.

386
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:51,745
Scott: the low Maybe the low-end membership.

387
00:25:51,985 --> 00:25:55,840
Scott: Yeah, they get a magazine and you get access to special events.

388
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,054
Rym: Yeah, these are definitely the kind of people who deserve our money.

389
00:25:58,376 --> 00:26:01,366
Scott: Yep, and You know they have exhibits there.

390
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:06,929
Scott: I think the current exhibit is a Todd McFarlane thing if I if I recall correctly I don't know offhand.

391
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,540
Scott: Yeah, but it's pretty cool.

392
00:26:09,441 --> 00:26:20,850
Scott: And they once a year their biggest fundraiser, but by no means their only fundraiser is this Arts Festival, which is pretty much a Gigantic artists alley of independent comic artists.

393
00:26:21,111 --> 00:26:29,820
Rym: I mean, there'll be web comic artists comic artists Some writers independent publishers pretty much everyone except underwear perverts.

394
00:26:30,263 --> 00:26:32,699
Scott: Yeah, even though there were a little bit of underwear pervert in his.

395
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:39,280
Rym: yeah There was one guy who was drawing a sketch of Colossus for someone and I saw that specifically and it stood out in my mind.

396
00:26:39,521 --> 00:26:39,743
Rym: Yep,

397
00:26:40,186 --> 00:26:58,539
Scott: but I mean this stuff ranges from schmuck with a webcomic to schmuck printing stuff out of a laser printer at Kinko's folding it and stapling it and then giving it to you for a Quarter to a guy who has a professionally printed book Laying it out on the table and going hey, what's up?

398
00:26:59,061 --> 00:27:09,039
Rym: And then to people who made like hand-bound art like they made a bound book by themselves There was a guy who was he painted a comic like he painted it.

399
00:27:09,681 --> 00:27:15,437
Scott: Each comic was fully handmade by him painted and he had so many of them.

400
00:27:15,618 --> 00:27:17,991
Scott: not a whole lot But you know like 20 or so.

401
00:27:19,361 --> 00:27:24,440
Scott: So he's selling them for $20 and either they see sold out where he started selling him too fast.

402
00:27:25,002 --> 00:27:27,752
Scott: So you raised it to $30 and they didn't.

403
00:27:27,832 --> 00:27:29,900
Scott: the rate of selling did not decrease.

404
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:33,896
Scott: so So then he he had one left.

405
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,588
Scott: He just kept it for himself because he wasn't gonna sell them all.

406
00:27:36,628 --> 00:27:39,820
Scott: and yeah, that's the kind of stuff that goes on here.

407
00:27:40,082 --> 00:27:41,859
Scott: It's a crazy artists alley of awesome.

408
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:49,600
Rym: Now to the person in the forums who kind of tried to lambast us for our appraisal of Philly wizard world and underwear pervert culture.

409
00:27:50,523 --> 00:27:51,934
Rym: This was a comic convention.

410
00:27:51,974 --> 00:27:52,720
Rym: this was comics.

411
00:27:53,161 --> 00:27:55,188
Rym: This was the heart of comic re and you know what.

412
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:58,740
Rym: it was completely the opposite of Philly wizard world.

413
00:27:59,162 --> 00:27:59,904
Rym: It was awesome.

414
00:28:00,246 --> 00:28:01,471
Scott: observation number one.

415
00:28:01,932 --> 00:28:06,870
Scott: There were no annoying Corporate type things going on none.

416
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:12,479
Rym: I mean even though there were some somewhat large publishing houses there They just had a little table right next to everyone else's little table.

417
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:21,154
Scott: Yep Maybe some of them had a few extra tables or a few shinier books or more books or more staff and nicer name badges and t-shirts, but that's about it.

418
00:28:21,174 --> 00:28:24,779
Scott: and Also many more ladies.

419
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,960
Scott: Yes, I'd say there were probably more ladies there than men's.

420
00:28:30,362 --> 00:28:34,119
Rym: Also along with that a distinct lack of fanboy funk.

421
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,810
Scott: Definitely no funk even though it was crowded and warm.

422
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:38,773
Scott: There was no smell.

423
00:28:38,993 --> 00:28:40,980
Scott: It was it smelled like old building in New York.

424
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:48,365
Scott: Yeah Also There were people of all ages.

425
00:28:48,425 --> 00:28:53,960
Scott: they're not just you know, the the old, you know middle-aged type of comic guy.

426
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,432
Scott: There were young punk kids there.

427
00:28:56,472 --> 00:28:57,980
Scott: I saw some like mom and mom.

428
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,370
Scott: There are a lot of moms and dads pushing babies around.

429
00:29:01,164 --> 00:29:02,478
Scott: There was some old people there.

430
00:29:02,923 --> 00:29:04,519
Scott: You had all ages at this place.

431
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:10,840
Rym: And of course finally the crowd was incredibly friendly and easygoing and everyone was very sociable.

432
00:29:11,221 --> 00:29:18,714
Scott: Yep, pretty much you said I wore a shirt That was from the webcomic boases Boa SAS

433
00:29:18,754 --> 00:29:20,301
Rym: boy on a stick and slither Which

434
00:29:20,361 --> 00:29:28,440
Scott: is a relatively popular webcomic and before I even got in the door some guy in the street Complimented me on the shirt and at least 10 other people said hey, I like your shirt.

435
00:29:28,922 --> 00:29:30,489
Scott: Hey, have you seen the guy who makes the comic?

436
00:29:30,529 --> 00:29:30,931
Scott: is he here?

437
00:29:30,951 --> 00:29:32,919
Scott: I know he wasn't there, but we'll talk about that later.

438
00:29:34,803 --> 00:29:37,620
Scott: You know, I just people kept coming up to me and saying hi, I like your shirt.

439
00:29:38,481 --> 00:29:39,243
Scott: Comic convention.

440
00:29:39,564 --> 00:29:40,708
Scott: not a single person.

441
00:29:40,768 --> 00:29:43,698
Scott: I didn't already know came up to me and talked to me.

442
00:29:44,059 --> 00:29:47,174
Rym: zero in fact, people would generally avoid my gaze.

443
00:29:47,194 --> 00:29:58,610
Scott: yep, and You know, I when I tried to interact with people they would be like You try to interact with someone.

444
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,555
Scott: it's hard to get them to shut up.

445
00:29:59,615 --> 00:30:03,879
Scott: it's like alright good I just said I now you're not going away.

446
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:09,567
Rym: And of course a general observation about the actual Exhibitors at the mocha art festival.

447
00:30:10,149 --> 00:30:11,011
Rym: No one was pushy.

448
00:30:11,372 --> 00:30:13,940
Rym: No one was bothering me or trying to get me to buy stuff.

449
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:15,952
Rym: In fact, one guy was really cool.

450
00:30:15,973 --> 00:30:17,120
Rym: I'll talk about his stuff.

451
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:25,486
Rym: I thought I saw what his books were about and I bought the first one and Someone said I think it was.

452
00:30:25,506 --> 00:30:28,515
Rym: Scott actually said yeah, you should buy all of them buy them all.

453
00:30:28,876 --> 00:30:44,164
Rym: and the artist himself said Hey, man, only buy one buy the rest later if you like that one, you know As opposed to the Philly wizard world where people were practically trying to force me to pull out my wallet and buy their $5 Crappy little comic.

454
00:30:44,585 --> 00:30:56,180
Scott: now keep in mind there were some people who did have a sales pitch But they didn't deliver the pitch until I was already Standing at their table looking at this stuff of my own free will and already interacting with them.

455
00:30:56,341 --> 00:31:01,227
Rym: Yep, like if you made eye contact with someone who obviously had a stick You know, I look at someone's table.

456
00:31:01,689 --> 00:31:03,456
Scott: They're like, you know, they give me the nod.

457
00:31:03,676 --> 00:31:04,600
Scott: then I go up, you know.

458
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,223
Scott: I look at them.

459
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:06,508
Scott: they say hey, how you doing?

460
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,320
Scott: They show me what's on their table is free samples.

461
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:14,350
Scott: I read it, you know, and then if I look please they go, you know And I start looking at something else.

462
00:31:14,431 --> 00:31:15,720
Scott: then they deliver the sales pitch.

463
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:22,460
Scott: They don't reach out into the aisles delivering the sales pitch as not everyone but some people did at wizard world Philly.

464
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:26,532
Rym: Also, there were a lot of cool free things.

465
00:31:26,773 --> 00:31:28,660
Rym: In fact one particularly cool free thing.

466
00:31:29,322 --> 00:31:33,580
Rym: I'll mention it now because honestly, I don't remember who had them at their table.

467
00:31:33,901 --> 00:31:36,010
Rym: Yeah, I feel bad because you guys were awesome.

468
00:31:36,071 --> 00:31:36,432
Rym: They were.

469
00:31:36,472 --> 00:31:39,384
Scott: they were super super awesome people Giving away.

470
00:31:39,484 --> 00:31:43,760
Scott: they made arts and crafts out of wood and they painted them and they were super cool.

471
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:54,592
Scott: And they gave out little tiny pac-man ghosts that were all unique and individually painted in different ways And they were all super cool and they were free and they were free.

472
00:31:54,732 --> 00:31:58,384
Scott: little wooden pac-man ghosts painted uniquely Not even like.

473
00:31:58,404 --> 00:31:59,991
Rym: they weren't even marked as like.

474
00:32:00,111 --> 00:32:01,296
Rym: oh they come to our thing.

475
00:32:01,356 --> 00:32:02,140
Rym: or they was just free.

476
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:03,672
Rym: They were just doing it because they wanted to.

477
00:32:03,712 --> 00:32:04,539
Rym: they were having fun with this.

478
00:32:04,861 --> 00:32:08,260
Scott: Yeah, but I forgot to take a little piece of something to say who they were.

479
00:32:08,501 --> 00:32:08,843
Rym: I did.

480
00:32:09,467 --> 00:32:11,680
Rym: I made a point of taking one of their business cards.

481
00:32:11,961 --> 00:32:15,900
Rym: The problem is I took a lot of business cards and I don't remember whose business card was.

482
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,972
Scott: We can just go to all the websites till we figure it out.

483
00:32:18,334 --> 00:32:20,147
Rym: Yeah, we can try that later So we'll post it.

484
00:32:20,268 --> 00:32:25,000
Scott: if we find out who that was We'll post in the forum because they're awesome because I really like my little ghostie.

485
00:32:25,521 --> 00:32:26,504
Scott: Love my little ghostie.

486
00:32:26,765 --> 00:32:29,814
Rym: and also one more general observation before we talk about the meat.

487
00:32:30,637 --> 00:32:40,712
Rym: at Philly wizard world When I if you wanted an autograph or if you bought something It was basically just a business transaction And if you ask someone they'd either charge you.

488
00:32:40,753 --> 00:32:42,420
Rym: it was tough to get people to sign things.

489
00:32:43,103 --> 00:32:43,606
Scott: I didn't have that.

490
00:32:44,169 --> 00:32:48,951
Scott: every time I bought something at Philly wizard world well when I bought something from the Creator they just signed it.

491
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:54,714
Scott: but you know, the Profession like the people who were there to do autographs the famous people.

492
00:32:54,794 --> 00:32:57,579
Scott: you had to get in lines get tickets Yeah, all that sort of stuff.

493
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:07,928
Rym: but not only did the people here sign things but every person with a couple exceptions who signed something for me drew an awesome sketch of somewhat complex Drawing skills.

494
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,964
Scott: Yeah, that is something that was different Is it Philly wizard world?

495
00:33:11,004 --> 00:33:15,966
Scott: and people sign things maybe because it was more, you know, they were signing more things But I don't think so.

496
00:33:15,986 --> 00:33:18,782
Scott: It was pretty crowded at mocha, you know Mean.

497
00:33:18,862 --> 00:33:22,633
Scott: so any given person was doing just as much business as they.

498
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:27,085
Scott: you know, I imagine someone at wizard world was doing They you know wizard world.

499
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:29,715
Scott: They just signed it and gave it to you at mocha.

500
00:33:29,736 --> 00:33:30,820
Scott: They tend to be personalized.

501
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,192
Scott: They would write your name and they draw a little funny picture.

502
00:33:33,253 --> 00:33:34,660
Scott: They'd ask you what you wanted to draw.

503
00:33:34,761 --> 00:33:37,379
Scott: They talked to you, you know, and then they would sign it.

504
00:33:37,522 --> 00:33:43,328
Rym: Yeah They'd spend pretty much as much time as you were willing to spend with them talking unless there was a huge line or there were People really in the way.

505
00:33:43,348 --> 00:33:43,912
Rym: and

506
00:33:43,932 --> 00:33:58,980
Scott: even when there's a huge line I remember seeing like, you know a whole bunch of people waiting to talk to someone and the guy was still personalizing and drawing little pictures and all their stuff and Even like a guy walked up with like all like all volumes of some guys thing and he did all of them.

507
00:33:59,082 --> 00:33:59,632
Scott: He didn't care.

508
00:33:59,796 --> 00:34:04,332
Scott: He was like You know wizard world they're like, alright, I can't do all these.

509
00:34:04,352 --> 00:34:06,099
Scott: you're bringing up too many.

510
00:34:07,701 --> 00:34:13,688
Rym: Now, of course Scott and I went with our friend Yuko who actually knows a lot of the webcomic artist and is a published comic Artist herself.

511
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:17,031
Rym: Yeah, so she Introduced us to a lot of awesome people.

512
00:34:17,192 --> 00:34:18,420
Scott: We had an insider

513
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,964
Rym: yep, like instead like a

514
00:34:20,004 --> 00:34:20,847
Scott: little tour guide

515
00:34:21,088 --> 00:34:32,659
Rym: like a lot of the cool wet like particularly the people who do questionable content and I'm trying to remember who else offhand before I look through all my stuff, but We got the little like they were instead of just oh, hey, we like your comic.

516
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,891
Rym: It was oh, hey, these are my friends blah.

517
00:34:35,012 --> 00:34:36,500
Rym: Ooh, and then we got to talk to him for a while.

518
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,002
Scott: Yep.

519
00:34:37,022 --> 00:34:37,886
Scott: All right.

520
00:34:37,906 --> 00:34:39,031
Scott: So let's talk about who we saw.

521
00:34:39,051 --> 00:34:43,288
Rym: All right, right, of course I want to start right away with Brian Lee O'Malley.

522
00:34:43,668 --> 00:34:50,754
Scott: Okay, because he's a little bigger than most of the other people there But yes, he is but I want to start with him because Scott pilgrim is fantastic.

523
00:34:51,315 --> 00:34:58,458
Scott: All right, so Scott pilgrim I think the aim of it is like teen girls mostly but it's fucking entertaining.

524
00:34:58,498 --> 00:34:59,140
Scott: Let me tell you that.

525
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,183
Rym: Yeah, I don't know.

526
00:35:00,283 --> 00:35:02,870
Rym: I'm not exactly sure what I like so much about it.

527
00:35:04,783 --> 00:35:10,859
Rym: I haven't I haven't thought about it enough to figure it out But for some reason it just really sucked me in and I love it.

528
00:35:11,602 --> 00:35:13,889
Scott: My favorite part was the end where it turns in like this.

529
00:35:14,431 --> 00:35:19,004
Scott: It's sort of like a big dance type of you know, it's The fighting.

530
00:35:19,165 --> 00:35:19,587
Rym: Yeah.

531
00:35:19,627 --> 00:35:25,923
Scott: Yeah, it's like normally the fighting is the worst part But here the fighting was like this huge amazing Super.

532
00:35:25,983 --> 00:35:27,750
Scott: it felt like a little party while I was reading it.

533
00:35:27,911 --> 00:35:30,019
Rym: the fact that the coins came out of the guy after he beat him.

534
00:35:30,365 --> 00:35:39,157
Rym: Yeah Yeah And the dialogue is really just funny and witty and the art style is somewhat unique.

535
00:35:39,197 --> 00:35:39,860
Rym: it stands out.

536
00:35:40,401 --> 00:35:46,400
Scott: Yeah, if you're not reading Scott pilgrim, you are a. this is a new shtick that someone else started another podcast.

537
00:35:46,521 --> 00:35:50,079
Scott: But if you're not reading Scott pilgrim, you are a fool fool.

538
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:54,040
Rym: And of course Brian Lee O'Malley himself was very cool.

539
00:35:54,141 --> 00:35:57,180
Rym: He signed the book that I didn't even buy from him at the con.

540
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,480
Rym: It was actually the book was given to me as a gift from someone else and then he signed it.

541
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:04,956
Scott: Anyway, yep, and he was selling all his books of the con even his newest volume.

542
00:36:04,976 --> 00:36:06,079
Scott: He had plenty of stock.

543
00:36:07,143 --> 00:36:08,580
Scott: Just you know all-around friendly.

544
00:36:09,806 --> 00:36:10,515
Scott: Who else was there?

545
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:12,307
Scott: Oh Here's some guys.

546
00:36:12,347 --> 00:36:14,095
Scott: We didn't even know about until we got there.

547
00:36:14,155 --> 00:36:21,499
Rym: Yeah, they basically Dragged us in and gave us some swag and then we realized what their comic was all about and that was it.

548
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:29,438
Scott: now This is pretty much if Rym has an alley This is a laser slicing that alley in perfect symmetry down the middle.

549
00:36:29,879 --> 00:36:36,749
Rym: Yeah I mean there are a lot of weird things I like but this is one avenue of humor that I for some reason just can't Get enough of.

550
00:36:36,952 --> 00:36:44,868
Scott: yes now The website is wonder mark calm W-o-n-d-e-r-m-a-r-k dot-com now.

551
00:36:45,229 --> 00:36:46,332
Scott: I don't remember the guy.

552
00:36:46,352 --> 00:36:47,434
Scott: I think his name is mark.

553
00:36:47,715 --> 00:36:48,496
Scott: That's just a guess.

554
00:36:48,616 --> 00:36:51,358
Scott: Yeah, I Really don't remember his name.

555
00:36:51,821 --> 00:37:00,387
Scott: Wonder yes, but the comic that he does at least the one that we care about is called Poop jokes and top hats.

556
00:37:00,849 --> 00:37:02,736
Scott: or was it the reverse top hats and poop jokes.

557
00:37:03,257 --> 00:37:03,759
Scott: I forget that.

558
00:37:04,565 --> 00:37:06,240
Rym: That should sum it up nicely.

559
00:37:06,862 --> 00:37:11,153
Rym: It is exactly what it sounds like and that is what Rym likes.

560
00:37:11,394 --> 00:37:13,840
Scott: Rym likes poop jokes and Rym likes top hat.

561
00:37:13,962 --> 00:37:14,553
Rym: Yes, I do.

562
00:37:15,664 --> 00:37:18,699
Scott: The the drawings the art style looks really.

563
00:37:19,841 --> 00:37:21,606
Scott: It looks like the Quaker in the haha guy.

564
00:37:21,627 --> 00:37:21,887
Scott: Haha.

565
00:37:22,108 --> 00:37:23,753
Scott: That's what it looks like.

566
00:37:24,014 --> 00:37:25,297
Rym: I'm making a poop joke.

567
00:37:25,538 --> 00:37:35,316
Scott: That's right It's all it looks like, you know, like 1800s Semi-realistic Character sketches going clever dialogue very clever dot.

568
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,400
Scott: You want me to let's read a comic?

569
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,334
Rym: All right, you have one in front of you and I don't I do.

570
00:37:39,455 --> 00:37:40,259
Rym: I'm looking at our next.

571
00:37:41,143 --> 00:37:50,640
Scott: okay, so there is a relatively normal Built man with a funny 1800 style beard, you know where there's a mustache.

572
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:53,940
Scott: But the chin is shaved and the mustache connects to the beards on the side.

573
00:37:54,121 --> 00:37:58,319
Scott: Yeah, all right, and there's a really really fat guy who looks like Taft.

574
00:37:59,228 --> 00:38:01,444
Scott: the fat guy says Pie.

575
00:38:01,584 --> 00:38:06,200
Scott: I demand pie key lime banana cream cherry apple or meringue.

576
00:38:07,181 --> 00:38:14,200
Scott: The normal guy says how tragic a victim of society's scorn you cope with the stigma by drowning your sorrows and further consumption.

577
00:38:15,007 --> 00:38:21,150
Scott: the fat guy says as Interesting as your amateur analysis may be it fails in one important respect.

578
00:38:21,571 --> 00:38:24,779
Scott: It does not in fact produce pie for me to eat.

579
00:38:26,301 --> 00:38:31,239
Scott: The skinny guy says but I understand you I accept you for who you are.

580
00:38:31,661 --> 00:38:35,033
Scott: The fat man says I'm a man who needs pie.

581
00:38:35,254 --> 00:38:40,808
Scott: That is who I am Yeah, very penny arcade esque.

582
00:38:41,109 --> 00:38:44,160
Rym: well certain I mean there's different types of penny arcade that is true.

583
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:47,211
Rym: It's the ones where taiko talks a lot penny arcade.

584
00:38:47,793 --> 00:38:54,360
Scott: Yes, that is the type of penny arcade Type comic that this is and the entertainment value is high.

585
00:38:54,421 --> 00:39:00,998
Rym: Yeah I've noticed that lately the comics we like the most at least web comic wise are the ones that we don't really.

586
00:39:01,018 --> 00:39:03,500
Rym: I mean the art Is usually stylized or something?

587
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:14,350
Rym: but the dialogue is witty to the point of being stupid like overly witty dialogue a core something that Might have a moral or a lesson but probably doesn't.

588
00:39:14,711 --> 00:39:24,998
Scott: mm-hmm like a boa says so if you're a fan of A penny arcade or top hats or poop jokes go to wondermark.com right now.

589
00:39:25,219 --> 00:39:38,747
Rym: Yep now right along those lines another hilarious little comic that we were turned on to is the mighty Skullboy army by Jacob Shabbat Shabbat Chabot Shabbot J bot.

590
00:39:39,108 --> 00:39:41,317
Rym: I don't know CH a BOT.

591
00:39:41,498 --> 00:39:43,725
Rym: Sorry Jacob Yeah, he's from beetle bug comics.

592
00:39:43,806 --> 00:39:49,909
Rym: now that I bought the little 50 cent comic and you go bought the bigger one And there's a whole bunch of in my rental.

593
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,980
Rym: I read as much of this as I could get my hands on.

594
00:39:52,702 --> 00:39:53,525
Rym: It's just hilarious.

595
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:55,390
Scott: It is pretty freaking hilarious.

596
00:39:55,411 --> 00:40:04,340
Rym: It's just this little Skullboy who honestly His personality is almost identical to black mage from 8-bit theater.

597
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:11,037
Scott: He reminds me sort of a black mage but also sort of a Dexter or a mandark from Dexter's lab.

598
00:40:11,057 --> 00:40:11,378
Scott: Yes.

599
00:40:11,479 --> 00:40:14,484
Scott: Yes or Did you ever watch?

600
00:40:14,524 --> 00:40:18,120
Scott: there was that other Cartoon Network show that was more recent that had the grim reaper on it?

601
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:28,707
Scott: And there was the girl in that show Sort of like that girl only Not as you know in Like one aspect of her not the whole character.

602
00:40:28,747 --> 00:40:30,231
Scott: Yeah, she was really smart and whatever.

603
00:40:30,251 --> 00:40:32,579
Scott: but yeah you get the idea and it's just.

604
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:37,736
Rym: it's very Simple and very hilarious and I'm not sure how much else I could say about it.

605
00:40:37,756 --> 00:40:38,720
Rym: You really just have to read it.

606
00:40:39,021 --> 00:40:52,409
Scott: It's a skull boy and he has an army which consists of a stupid robot and a smart monkey kind of and for a brief period an intern yes, and He's in school, but you know, he has his army.

607
00:40:52,429 --> 00:40:56,660
Scott: that does things and it's just hilarious situations and craziness.

608
00:40:58,306 --> 00:41:07,820
Rym: So if you're into that sort of thing Now also I ran into webcomic artist wise one of my favorite webcomic artist John Allison who does a scary-go-round.

609
00:41:08,304 --> 00:41:09,153
Scott: It's that comic you like.

610
00:41:09,173 --> 00:41:14,973
Rym: Yeah, I Recommend to everyone out there at least read a little bit of scary-go-round.

611
00:41:15,494 --> 00:41:16,136
Rym: You might like it.

612
00:41:16,177 --> 00:41:25,280
Rym: You might not but I Absolutely adore it and all I can really say about John Allison is that he is the most charmingly British person I've ever met.

613
00:41:25,644 --> 00:41:26,151
Scott: Oh, he's British.

614
00:41:26,394 --> 00:41:35,060
Rym: Yeah The comic is really really unique and it has that same kind of good dialogue thing going with it.

615
00:41:36,341 --> 00:41:37,910
Rym: Plus of course, he signed the little book.

616
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:38,573
Rym: I brought from him.

617
00:41:39,217 --> 00:41:41,868
Scott: Hooray Is it a book of scary-go-round comics?

618
00:41:41,989 --> 00:41:44,238
Scott: Of course, is it like from the beginning?

619
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:44,780
Scott: or what is it?

620
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,426
Rym: It's from mostly the beginning.

621
00:41:46,446 --> 00:41:47,249
Rym: Okay.

622
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:49,900
Scott: Did he have books for all of his scary-go-round?

623
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,200
Rym: He had a whole bunch of books.

624
00:41:51,401 --> 00:41:57,347
Rym: I would have bought more but as you know because I borrowed money from you to buy this book I didn't have so much cash on me at the time.

625
00:41:57,367 --> 00:41:59,254
Scott: Oh, yeah, you owe me 20 bucks.

626
00:41:59,335 --> 00:42:00,700
Scott: I didn't take back.

627
00:42:01,062 --> 00:42:02,634
Rym: I'll give you 20 bucks after we do the show.

628
00:42:02,655 --> 00:42:12,149
Scott: Hey better Okay Another guy people we met were Dale Baron and David Hellman Writer and artist.

629
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:18,997
Scott: of a lesson is learned Had the damage is irreversible, which is a fantastic web comic.

630
00:42:19,983 --> 00:42:21,730
Rym: It's more.

631
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,738
Rym: it's art it's it's not.

632
00:42:23,778 --> 00:42:25,243
Rym: it's all art Yeah, but it's not.

633
00:42:25,303 --> 00:42:30,980
Rym: I'm trying to think of what I would classify it as it is a comic in that there are you know?

634
00:42:31,161 --> 00:42:36,814
Scott: Panels some to kind of and There is characters a dialogue in those panels kind of.

635
00:42:36,894 --> 00:42:43,215
Rym: I'd say it's experimental But usually when someone uses that term for art what they actually mean is bad.

636
00:42:43,456 --> 00:42:44,720
Rym: Yes, and I don't mean bad.

637
00:42:44,927 --> 00:42:56,100
Scott: Yeah Instead of making a comic book with you know pages and pages of stuff with every single one of their Comics is more like a poster and that you they even sell it like that.

638
00:42:56,100 --> 00:43:01,338
Scott: You don't buy a book of all their stuff you buy a poster of the one comic they did that you like.

639
00:43:01,639 --> 00:43:06,080
Rym: in fact I bought a poster of one of my favorite comics they did about solipsistic cat.

640
00:43:06,544 --> 00:43:08,160
Scott: Well, you tried to buy it online.

641
00:43:08,301 --> 00:43:13,080
Rym: I tried to buy it online months and months ago as a gift and they just never responded in my email.

642
00:43:13,401 --> 00:43:19,496
Rym: So when I explained that to them at the con they were like, oh, we're so sorry Uh-huh, and then I bought it from them and it was awesome.

643
00:43:19,778 --> 00:43:23,854
Scott: Yep So, you know every they do basically one-shots didn't?

644
00:43:23,874 --> 00:43:27,469
Scott: they once have some continuity Like between two or three of them.

645
00:43:27,549 --> 00:43:39,424
Scott: every now and then there's a little bit a little tiny bit but usually it's they make one big thing and it's it's pretty short and meaningful and Really cleverly drawn.

646
00:43:39,464 --> 00:43:43,736
Scott: but at the con they had this thing printed on a piece of paper.

647
00:43:43,776 --> 00:43:45,380
Scott: that I think is hilarious.

648
00:43:46,444 --> 00:43:49,758
Scott: And it's it's bitches and hoes.

649
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:59,919
Scott: now it's be bitches bit c h e z and ampersand hoes h o s e.

650
00:44:00,722 --> 00:44:05,179
Rym: It's little dogs who are firemen little female dogs who are firemen.

651
00:44:05,661 --> 00:44:07,243
Rym: It's their comics are like that.

652
00:44:07,263 --> 00:44:19,008
Scott: I mean it is and hoes firemen hoes and This particular comic that they gave out for free was is called in the shower and basically the fire they show up.

653
00:44:19,749 --> 00:44:20,898
Scott: and Well, it's.

654
00:44:20,979 --> 00:44:23,394
Scott: I can read this part Bitches and hoes.

655
00:44:23,434 --> 00:44:31,009
Scott: since you're the only all-female puppies fire squad will be up to you to rescue the burning building where pretty ladies go To shower and clean their delicate bodies in the nude.

656
00:44:31,977 --> 00:44:41,002
Scott: the next panel is dogs standing next to a fire hose spraying water at a fire and all around the fire are Pretty naked ladies going.

657
00:44:41,083 --> 00:44:41,426
Scott: teehee.

658
00:44:44,072 --> 00:44:48,028
Rym: This is in fact the comic where we got the word bargo from that we use so often.

659
00:44:48,148 --> 00:44:48,530
Scott: Oh is it?

660
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:50,376
Scott: Yeah, I thought we just made that up.

661
00:44:50,617 --> 00:44:50,837
Scott: No.

662
00:44:50,878 --> 00:44:51,821
Rym: No, I think we still.

663
00:44:51,841 --> 00:44:57,587
Rym: we got it indirectly from the comic though Bargo apparently is a guy having a heart attack and not someone vomiting.

664
00:44:57,647 --> 00:44:58,109
Scott: That's fine.

665
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:14,086
Scott: And then at the end of this comic they randomly invite the bitches and hoes to a Passover Seder Which is which is pretty funny because apparently I forget which one of the guys The other writer or the artist but I talked to him a bit about.

666
00:45:14,106 --> 00:45:18,483
Scott: I was like, hey you Jewish He's like, yeah, so now, you know meeting more atheist Jews every day.

667
00:45:18,503 --> 00:45:18,563
Scott: Yep.

668
00:45:19,225 --> 00:45:22,584
Rym: Yeah You know, they were also.

669
00:45:22,644 --> 00:45:30,301
Rym: they were just really If you if you read their comic You'll probably have a idea in your head of what kind of people they are.

670
00:45:30,322 --> 00:45:32,829
Rym: and if you meet them, they're exactly like that.

671
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,057
Rym: Yep, they they they're the same.

672
00:45:35,137 --> 00:45:37,646
Rym: They're exactly the kind of people you would expect to write a comic like this.

673
00:45:37,666 --> 00:45:39,574
Scott: I Didn't really try to.

674
00:45:39,735 --> 00:45:40,098
Scott: I didn't.

675
00:45:40,219 --> 00:45:41,749
Scott: I never thought about what they would be like.

676
00:45:42,592 --> 00:45:48,170
Scott: You know when I read the comic but once I met them, uh, you know, I was like, oh you're the guys to do that.

677
00:45:49,592 --> 00:45:53,011
Rym: I really wanted to interview them because I have a lot of like.

678
00:45:53,032 --> 00:45:56,949
Rym: I could do a whole show just asking them about this comic and what they do and why and how.

679
00:45:57,029 --> 00:46:01,527
Rym: but Honestly, it was really too loud to do anything like that at the mocha art festival.

680
00:46:01,728 --> 00:46:03,874
Scott: Yeah It was cramped.

681
00:46:04,316 --> 00:46:07,310
Rym: Yeah, if I had had a booth or something, but now I just had my little microphone.

682
00:46:07,644 --> 00:46:14,038
Scott: Yeah There was a podcast there that had a booth indie spinner rack Which I listened to a few episodes of and it's pretty good.

683
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:15,883
Scott: What they do is they?

684
00:46:16,344 --> 00:46:27,869
Scott: their comics podcast only about independent comics and they'll interview independent comic artists and writers and they'll they'll review the latest independent comics that are popular.

685
00:46:27,889 --> 00:46:41,808
Scott: and so if you're interested in Non-underwear pervert comics And we don't talk about them enough or frequently enough on GeekNights So you can listen to indie spinner rack and they will cover the non-underwear pervert comics for you.

686
00:46:41,969 --> 00:46:45,870
Rym: quite Now another thing that I didn't even notice it.

687
00:46:45,950 --> 00:47:00,790
Rym: I was just walking around and I finally I was looking at someone's table and I saw this book called the collected prison funnies By chips d'arski and it said at the bottom for mature readers and has a little picture of a so obviously a prisoner on it.

688
00:47:01,691 --> 00:47:02,595
Rym: So I figure all right.

689
00:47:02,635 --> 00:47:03,398
Rym: This is interesting.

690
00:47:03,538 --> 00:47:04,421
Rym: I really like Oz.

691
00:47:04,502 --> 00:47:05,425
Rym: I like dark humor.

692
00:47:05,465 --> 00:47:09,981
Rym: Let's see what this has got and It was absolutely hilarious.

693
00:47:10,605 --> 00:47:11,650
Rym: I am quite pleased with it.

694
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:20,386
Rym: It was a whole bunch of like newspaper comics only there were horrible and about prison I mean one of them like a riot breaks out and it's just three panels of violence.

695
00:47:20,687 --> 00:47:23,974
Scott: Yeah, that's it I Mean.

696
00:47:24,014 --> 00:47:27,432
Rym: I don't want to rue or try to read them or spoil the humor from them But they're.

697
00:47:28,154 --> 00:47:29,378
Rym: I really enjoyed this.

698
00:47:29,799 --> 00:47:33,270
Rym: and then there's a whole bunch of guest comics where other artists did prison comics.

699
00:47:33,733 --> 00:47:36,630
Rym: And then there's two full-on short story comics at the end.

700
00:47:37,711 --> 00:47:39,039
Rym: That's cool all that.

701
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:47,979
Rym: and this was like three bucks four bucks Awesome, and this is the guy who when Scott prompted me to buy all his stuff He said only buy one now buy the rest later.

702
00:47:48,059 --> 00:47:50,227
Scott: Yeah, he had more funny prison stories.

703
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:51,010
Scott: You should have bought them all.

704
00:47:51,171 --> 00:47:52,476
Rym: I'm gonna order them all from his side.

705
00:47:52,516 --> 00:47:53,621
Rym: I just haven't gotten a chance to yet.

706
00:47:53,641 --> 00:47:54,384
Scott: That's a good idea.

707
00:47:54,766 --> 00:47:55,368
Rym: It's really good.

708
00:47:56,651 --> 00:47:58,179
Scott: Really isn't comic really dark?

709
00:47:58,259 --> 00:48:05,597
Rym: and apparently there's a lot of other stuff in the book Like he talks about how it was popular in prisons actually among prisoners.

710
00:48:05,617 --> 00:48:08,334
Rym: oh Yeah, there's.

711
00:48:08,494 --> 00:48:09,698
Rym: the book is really well worth it.

712
00:48:09,718 --> 00:48:10,460
Rym: At least the first one.

713
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,609
Rym: There's a lot of extra content other than just the comic.

714
00:48:14,971 --> 00:48:22,962
Scott: Yeah, that reminds me of another comic I saw there that didn't really look that interesting and I don't forget who did it But it was they had.

715
00:48:23,042 --> 00:48:29,710
Scott: he had true stories of Like undersea disaster and then true stories of wild animal disaster.

716
00:48:30,011 --> 00:48:34,206
Scott: Oh, yeah, it's sort of like those Fox shows like world's worst animal.

717
00:48:34,246 --> 00:48:35,470
Rym: world's blankie is blank.

718
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:37,638
Scott: Yeah, world's blankie is blank of comic books.

719
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:44,588
Scott: and he had a comic and the whole comic was just drawn in graphic form panels and whatnot.

720
00:48:45,472 --> 00:48:47,662
Scott: True story is a hundred percent true.

721
00:48:47,722 --> 00:48:49,430
Scott: He checked out to make sure they were all true.

722
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:59,308
Scott: He said he just kind of looked him up on the internet of real times that you know an animal mauled a person or a fish a shark bit someone or all that kind of stuff.

723
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:06,490
Scott: and I just remember that because I talked to that guy and this reminded me of that because it's also sort of true prison stories.

724
00:49:06,792 --> 00:49:08,844
Scott: Yeah, true animal mauling stories.

725
00:49:08,965 --> 00:49:12,007
Scott: Yeah world's blankie is blank of comics.

726
00:49:12,028 --> 00:49:23,289
Rym: I Also ran into at one point a booth of with a girl at it and she said that the comic like she told me this comic right here is the dirtiest comic at this entire event.

727
00:49:23,309 --> 00:49:26,953
Rym: and I said, all right I'm game.

728
00:49:27,254 --> 00:49:31,809
Rym: and I opened it up and I flipped through it and it was indeed the dirtiest comic at that entire name.

729
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,173
Scott: one Horrible thing that was in it.

730
00:49:33,474 --> 00:49:41,141
Rym: Just just naked people killing people dogs exploding Breasts, it was just insane.

731
00:49:41,763 --> 00:49:43,449
Scott: each of the killer worse or better?

732
00:49:44,455 --> 00:49:47,090
Rym: I couldn't say worse only because it wasn't that realistic.

733
00:49:47,552 --> 00:49:51,209
Rym: Uh-huh, but nothing can really get more realistic than each of the killer.

734
00:49:52,213 --> 00:49:53,899
Scott: Each of the killer isn't really realistic.

735
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,465
Rym: I think well, it's realistic.

736
00:49:55,505 --> 00:49:56,730
Rym: in terms of the portrayal.

737
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:59,567
Rym: Yeah, I mean it looks like they're doing what they're doing.

738
00:49:59,587 --> 00:50:04,404
Rym: I guess We should do a show on each of the killer.

739
00:50:04,545 --> 00:50:10,255
Rym: ooh tomorrow We could talk about yeah Okay, yeah, we got a thing.

740
00:50:10,576 --> 00:50:12,765
Rym: we do tell the whole story of that.

741
00:50:13,367 --> 00:50:14,150
Scott: oh, that's a good idea.

742
00:50:14,351 --> 00:50:15,157
Rym: That was a good story.

743
00:50:15,238 --> 00:50:16,326
Scott: We could that could be a fable.

744
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:16,588
Scott: Who knows?

745
00:50:16,668 --> 00:50:16,849
Scott: All right.

746
00:50:19,051 --> 00:50:19,954
Scott: So, let's see who else is there.

747
00:50:19,994 --> 00:50:22,825
Scott: the guy Andy runton who does owlee was there.

748
00:50:23,066 --> 00:50:24,250
Rym: owlee is fantastic.

749
00:50:25,011 --> 00:50:26,075
Rym: I I just I love owlee.

750
00:50:26,095 --> 00:50:28,785
Rym: It's very sweet and innocent and it's not really.

751
00:50:28,805 --> 00:50:32,086
Scott: and as soon as I saw the guy I was like, that's the owlee guy, isn't it?

752
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:35,241
Scott: He was just like this jovial kind of happy dude.

753
00:50:35,361 --> 00:50:38,738
Rym: Yeah, he just looks really tall and good-natured And he was very good-natured.

754
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:41,090
Scott: very it was extremely good-natured.

755
00:50:41,873 --> 00:50:45,390
Rym: He had but it was only the prototype or something.

756
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:52,156
Rym: But he had a stuffed owlee with a wormy on its head and I really wanted it But it was obvious that he only had the one.

757
00:50:52,176 --> 00:50:58,128
Scott: he had owlee t-shirts and all his books and he had the free comic book that he gave out in free comic book day.

758
00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:04,409
Scott: and You know you just talking all kinds of people hanging out drawing out leaves for people just having a good time.

759
00:51:05,371 --> 00:51:10,225
Scott: Now not owlee isn't for everyone honestly, it's it's like a nursery school comic.

760
00:51:10,325 --> 00:51:19,804
Scott: Yeah, it really isn't particularly full of depth and allegory But you know one thing is that that I always like to point out.

761
00:51:19,864 --> 00:51:22,250
Scott: is it nowadays if you look at kids television?

762
00:51:23,191 --> 00:51:26,059
Scott: It's really only kids television.

763
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,965
Scott: adults really can't watch Teletubbies.

764
00:51:28,005 --> 00:51:28,767
Scott: It's painful.

765
00:51:29,088 --> 00:51:29,730
Scott: You know what I'm saying?

766
00:51:30,291 --> 00:51:31,521
Scott: You can't watch Power Rangers.

767
00:51:31,582 --> 00:51:32,167
Scott: It's painful.

768
00:51:33,911 --> 00:51:42,476
Scott: It's stuff like owlee or stuff like the Sesame Street that I watched when I was a kid or even stuff like Rocky and Bullwink Furola, Furola Kappa, Furola Kappa.

769
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:49,217
Scott: Yes stuff like Furola Kappa or stuff like that Japanese show with the With the Rube Goldberg machines.

770
00:51:49,357 --> 00:51:55,376
Scott: Oh, yeah, you know kids watch it cuz it's it's meant for them But it's all ages.

771
00:51:55,657 --> 00:51:59,290
Scott: anyone can enjoy it and I really really like all ages stuff.

772
00:51:59,752 --> 00:52:02,727
Rym: Now actually all ages a lot anything that says all ages.

773
00:52:02,767 --> 00:52:06,923
Rym: in America It usually means aimed at little kids and only for little kids.

774
00:52:07,064 --> 00:52:14,941
Scott: Yes, I Say that, you know if something is meant for kids and adults won't enjoy it It should say kids.

775
00:52:15,303 --> 00:52:24,495
Rym: but at the same time I really don't like things that adults can't enjoy that are designed for kids because that's really just dumbing things down for kids Which isn't going to serve them?

776
00:52:24,535 --> 00:52:28,510
Scott: Well, yep, if I have kids, I don't want them to look at the stupid for kids shit.

777
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:33,129
Scott: I want them to have the all-ages shit, which is something everyone can enjoy.

778
00:52:33,591 --> 00:52:37,505
Rym: But it just seems that a lot of people on this Mario everyone can enjoy Mario.

779
00:52:37,605 --> 00:52:40,472
Scott: Yeah, Mario's all ages You know.

780
00:52:40,512 --> 00:52:44,063
Scott: and another good example of all ages actually is an underwear pervert.

781
00:52:44,525 --> 00:52:52,313
Scott: if you go read Marvel adventures Spider-man, which is the spider-man comic that has nothing to do with all the bullshit and it's just the one that you're supposed to give Your kids.

782
00:52:52,816 --> 00:53:01,947
Scott: it's actually really good no matter what age you are And it's printed in you know, manga digest format for cheapness nah and color because it's spider-man.

783
00:53:02,549 --> 00:53:05,486
Scott: spider-man He's not gay.

784
00:53:06,494 --> 00:53:07,238
Rym: No, no way.

785
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:07,961
Scott: Let's see.

786
00:53:08,042 --> 00:53:09,368
Scott: What else did we see at mocha?

787
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:10,231
Scott: There were.

788
00:53:10,251 --> 00:53:14,485
Scott: there were some good independent publishers there the Audi publisher top shelf.

789
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:15,708
Scott: They have a lot of good stuff.

790
00:53:15,749 --> 00:53:18,152
Scott: top shelf Pantheon.

791
00:53:18,212 --> 00:53:24,090
Scott: they print like all the greats like they print the rabbi's cat which is up for an Eisner.

792
00:53:24,895 --> 00:53:25,639
Scott: Not even one one.

793
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:26,081
Scott: I don't know.

794
00:53:26,544 --> 00:53:27,530
Scott: they print Mouse.

795
00:53:28,815 --> 00:53:32,215
Scott: They you know all the great Graphic novels they print.

796
00:53:32,897 --> 00:53:40,239
Scott: that's that's Pantheon books, you know the the stuff that's literature, you know I mean if there's a will.

797
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:48,414
Scott: Eisner pretty much invented writing a Graphic novel as a work of literature as opposed to you know Just a comic book or whatever.

798
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:50,320
Scott: and he died recently.

799
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:57,328
Scott: and and it's kind of sad that not too many people followed suit in writing graphic works of literature.

800
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:02,910
Scott: But some did in there, you know, they're pretty much all really awesome.

801
00:54:03,291 --> 00:54:06,441
Scott: And if they exist Pantheon books is likely the publisher.

802
00:54:07,304 --> 00:54:15,382
Scott: So that's another good company to look out for The webcomic companies or a day fee press day free press and umbrella, right?

803
00:54:15,402 --> 00:54:15,843
Rym: Yeah.

804
00:54:15,883 --> 00:54:18,650
Scott: Yeah, at least I forget which one does which stuff.

805
00:54:20,417 --> 00:54:28,104
Rym: Yeah If there's anyone we met who we forgot to mention It's just because we'd forgot to pick up a business card or we we just forgot.

806
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:28,746
Rym: We're sorry.

807
00:54:29,067 --> 00:54:30,150
Rym: We met a lot of cool people.

808
00:54:30,471 --> 00:54:36,010
Scott: Yeah, there were a whole lot of people to meet and in one day we really couldn't you know, really meet everyone.

809
00:54:36,091 --> 00:54:41,230
Rym: Yeah Especially since a lot of these people were people that we knew of but we'd never actually seen.

810
00:54:41,853 --> 00:54:45,450
Rym: Yeah as a result we met a whole bunch of people and we forgot half of them.

811
00:54:46,635 --> 00:54:54,510
Scott: You know, maybe if we would have spent all weekend there We could have you know gone to each and every spot and you know had a big old conversation with everyone.

812
00:54:54,651 --> 00:54:56,337
Scott: But you know, we had to go home.

813
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:57,582
Scott: We had stuff to do.

814
00:54:58,004 --> 00:54:58,586
Rym: Yeah, we did.

815
00:54:58,868 --> 00:55:01,868
Scott: Yeah Anything else going down there?

816
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:03,092
Rym: Well, we had.

817
00:55:03,132 --> 00:55:07,270
Rym: we finally have a good passable GeekNights flyer to pass out of cons.

818
00:55:07,874 --> 00:55:15,130
Rym: Oh, that's true because while yuko was here for the weekend We had the stick figure flyer that I had made at an amazement.

819
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:21,669
Rym: well, I had commissioned someone to make at an amazement and then I had modified and She couldn't stand for that.

820
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:34,890
Rym: So she made us an awesome awesome awesome GeekNights flyer that once we have the final version will put up on the site one so she can get credit for it and Two so anyone who feels so inclined can bring it to their favorite convention with them.

821
00:55:35,492 --> 00:55:40,331
Scott: Yeah, we got a. I gotta get a scanner and go down to my parents house because they have two and they're not using either One.

822
00:55:40,372 --> 00:55:41,858
Rym: Yeah, my scanner doesn't work anymore.

823
00:55:42,019 --> 00:55:44,570
Scott: So I'll get a skull ghost to get the scanner for my parents house.

824
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:48,437
Scott: Then we could scan the flyer in Fire in digital format.

825
00:55:48,457 --> 00:55:48,738
Scott: Yeah.

826
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:59,309
Scott: Yeah, so maybe we'll just throw it up on the website and then if you want you can print out GeekNights flyers and Give them to all your friends family and post them up around town and all that good stuff.

827
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:03,601
Rym: Yep, mostly because intent because until now we've never advertised.

828
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:04,804
Scott: Yes until now.

829
00:56:04,864 --> 00:56:11,214
Scott: The only promotion the GeekNights is done is Is Being places.

830
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:12,278
Rym: that's really it.

831
00:56:12,359 --> 00:56:27,629
Scott: places at conventions talking to other podcasters mostly other podcasters talking to us and also You know telling our friends to tell other people and of course the podcast itself Google, etc, etc.

832
00:56:28,012 --> 00:56:28,350
Scott: It's yeah.

833
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:36,602
Rym: And while I mean we we have a graph now that we have we have enough listeners now to where the statistics we get are Meaningful and it's a steady upward stream.

834
00:56:36,742 --> 00:56:38,448
Rym: Like it's a perfect correlation.

835
00:56:38,769 --> 00:56:47,050
Scott: Yep So we're going to soon create the first long delayed GeekNights promo clip of audio.

836
00:56:47,411 --> 00:56:59,769
Scott: Yeah for other podcasts to play and we're actually going to start a push to promote GeekNights and get as many listeners as we Can because you know that there are thousands upon thousands of people out there who would love to listen to you.

837
00:56:59,789 --> 00:57:02,930
Scott: guys Just don't know about it or you know don't care.

838
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:14,329
Rym: Well, especially since some of our listeners have pointed out to us that and this is not our opinion this is our listeners because as Full of ourselves as we are I would really be uncomfortable making this sort of statement about myself.

839
00:57:14,933 --> 00:57:22,346
Rym: But other people who listen to our show have told us That they like our show a lot more than they like a lot of the other very highly ranked podcasts.

840
00:57:22,527 --> 00:57:22,687

Scott: Now is the time to start Helping us promote GeekNights in whatever small or big way you can.

843
00:57:41,868 --> 00:57:48,735
Rym: Yep It's basically a ramp up until Otakon when most likely we'll do a big show and then from there We're going to go to the con.

844
00:57:48,875 --> 00:57:52,729
Rym: I mean this year we're doing the convention circuit mostly as attendees and press.

Scott: look there.

851
00:58:22,866 --> 00:58:32,719
Scott: Yeah Write reviews of our show on places like iTunes and and The reviews I actually like because that means something.

852
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:39,380
Scott: the stupid voting mechanism just means that you got your listeners to sit around all day Clicking and changing IP addresses and clicking again.

853
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:44,321
Scott: Yeah or writing bots to do that or writing bots Yeah, but the reviews mean something.

854
00:58:44,341 --> 00:58:50,750
Scott: cuz that means someone thought about it and they you know They wrote about our show and gave us a star ranking even a bad reviews better than no review.

855
00:58:51,171 --> 00:58:52,797
Rym: Yeah, cuz we want negative feedback.

Rym: Yeah, because we've tried.

859
00:58:57,996 --> 00:59:08,490
Scott: we've tried to offend as many people as we could and it seems like when we offend people They they either just keep their mouths shut or maybe they don't exist or they just leave without saying anything.

860
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:09,434
Scott: I don't know at best.

861
00:59:09,494 --> 00:59:12,386

862
00:59:12,668 --> 00:59:18,966
Scott: Yeah We need someone to be like, yeah, you guys are going to hell bla bla bla.
