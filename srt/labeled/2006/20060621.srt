1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,933
Scott: It's Wednesday June 21st, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:14,134 --> 00:00:22,580
Rym: We talk about the recent anime convention Anime next and I gotta say we were gonna have a much more exciting episode tonight.

3
00:00:23,222 --> 00:00:24,226
Scott: Oh were we ever?

4
00:00:24,768 --> 00:00:24,929
Rym: now?

5
00:00:25,049 --> 00:00:37,596
Rym: Jim Vowles is the con chair of Otakon Arguably the biggest anime convention in the world outside of Japan If not, if not the biggest in terms of area definitely in my opinion the best.

6
00:00:37,997 --> 00:00:40,859
Scott: and from talking to him He's definitely an awesome awesome, dude.

7
00:00:41,221 --> 00:00:46,818
Rym: Yeah, he even I mean he took his time to come and talk to us about Otakon and himself And we were gonna have this great interview for you tonight.

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:01:03,279
Rym: now for those of you who listen to our Monday episode I Complained quite a bit about garage band and my new Mac and how it doesn't quite work at all for podcasting Yep, even though we're still using it right now.

9
00:01:03,782 --> 00:01:09,358
Rym: Yeah, mostly because I decommissioned my old Linux box, but that's beside the point Now decommission too soon.

10
00:01:11,522 --> 00:01:12,329
Rym: So we're all set.

11
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:12,974
Rym: he's online.

12
00:01:12,994 --> 00:01:13,680
Rym: we're talking to him.

13
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,200
Rym: You know idle chat getting ready to the interview and I had tested because the way we were going to do this interview was over.

14
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,890
Rym: I chat because as far as Apple says it just works.

15
00:01:23,031 --> 00:01:23,312
Scott: Okay.

16
00:01:23,332 --> 00:01:26,100
Scott: Wait, I think this is the time for me to read Apple's website.

17
00:01:26,301 --> 00:01:26,563
Rym: All right.

18
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:29,019
Rym: This is what Apple says as to how to make this happen.

19
00:01:30,448 --> 00:01:30,798
Scott: All right.

20
00:01:31,741 --> 00:01:36,160
Scott: So even if today's guests are in Paris while you're in Peoria, you can still put on a podcast together.

21
00:01:36,602 --> 00:01:39,540
Scott: Just start an audio chat using I chat and hit record.

22
00:01:39,921 --> 00:01:49,392
Scott: Garage band simultaneously records the audio from your chat and assigns different tracks to each participant identified by buddy name and icon so you can edit everything seamlessly.

23
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:56,878
Scott: and if using eyesight cameras to conduct a video chat Garage band even captures the real-time still image every time each guest speaks.

24
00:01:57,279 --> 00:02:00,940
Scott: see Instant podcast talk show and you didn't even have to dodge a flying chair.

25
00:02:01,341 --> 00:02:09,328
Scott: That is the text from Apple's website on how to do an eye chat plus garage band Podcast internet audio interview.

26
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:11,495
Rym: now, there's no more details.

27
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,260
Rym: or here's exactly how to do it.

28
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,266
Rym: Or here is here's what to do.

29
00:02:15,547 --> 00:02:17,614
Scott: or click this then click that.

30
00:02:17,694 --> 00:02:18,537
Scott: then click this.

31
00:02:18,617 --> 00:02:19,480
Scott: then click that that.

32
00:02:19,761 --> 00:02:21,810
Scott: Instructions do not exist now.

33
00:02:22,031 --> 00:02:22,855
Rym: All right, it says run.

34
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:26,990
Rym: I chat Run garage band start start an audio.

35
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:27,471
Scott: I chat.

36
00:02:27,572 --> 00:02:28,254
Scott: we already did that.

37
00:02:28,394 --> 00:02:29,498
Scott: Yep hit record.

38
00:02:29,678 --> 00:02:30,642
Scott: We did that All right.

39
00:02:30,682 --> 00:02:34,200
Rym: Now the thing is it doesn't even say in what program to hit record.

40
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:37,570
Rym: I assumed correctly that in garage band.

41
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,736
Rym: I had to do this, but it does not actually say.

42
00:02:39,756 --> 00:02:45,079
Scott: it doesn't actually say But it does have a little picture here of the record button from garage.

43
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:48,335
Rym: Yes I figured it out when I saw that there was in fact, no record button in.

44
00:02:48,415 --> 00:02:48,736
Rym: I chat.

45
00:02:48,757 --> 00:02:49,199
Rym: Mm-hmm.

46
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:51,135
Rym: So I hit record in garage band.

47
00:02:51,639 --> 00:03:05,732
Rym: now well first off I did this yesterday evening as I said with James and Lisa to test it to make sure it works because Jim Vowles is a guy we really wanted to talk to for a while and we wanted everything to go smoothly for him because he's Taking time out of his busy schedule to talk to us and being

48
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:12,000
Scott: smart technology professionals We always test something in a development sandbox before we do the real deal.

49
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:19,657
Scott: We make sure it works in advance and then when it comes time to go for real We do it the same same exact thing we did before.

50
00:03:19,697 --> 00:03:20,019
Scott: that worked.

51
00:03:20,481 --> 00:03:28,356
Rym: So James and Lisa were gracious enough to start up a little chat and James even turned off much of his firewall to make it Because he is more security conscious than we are.

52
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:30,405
Rym: Mm-hmm And I start.

53
00:03:30,425 --> 00:03:33,637
Rym: we started a little chat and then I hit record in garage band and garage.

54
00:03:33,657 --> 00:03:39,073
Rym: then Ben said hey We noticed that you're trying to use garage band and I chat something something.

55
00:03:39,354 --> 00:03:41,400
Rym: Would you like to record your I chat conversation?

56
00:03:42,003 --> 00:03:54,703
Rym: I said yes, and then it created a nice little Podcast thing with a track for every person in the conversation recorded all of our voices perfectly and even did a little meta thing in The Podcast track.

57
00:03:55,145 --> 00:04:09,418
Rym: All right, I'm recording with them and then about seven minutes into my recording garage band suddenly says hey I can't record anymore There are too many tracks or events or something and I'm done and it wouldn't let me record more than that.

58
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:11,888
Scott: seven minutes Wow, seven minutes.

59
00:04:11,928 --> 00:04:13,455
Scott: That's a great podcast.

60
00:04:13,495 --> 00:04:14,540
Scott: seven minute interviews BAM

61
00:04:15,001 --> 00:04:30,819
Rym: I was able to extend that somewhat by deleting the enhanced podcast track the jingles track, you know every track But the one we were talking on but even then I wasn't able to test how long it would actually let me record Nor was I able to determine exactly what factor it was.

62
00:04:31,503 --> 00:04:34,520
Rym: You know what factor was using to decide I couldn't record anymore.

63
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,598
Scott: Did you change the beats per minute like the guy in our forum said to?

64
00:04:37,618 --> 00:04:38,703
Rym: yes I tried that.

65
00:04:38,803 --> 00:04:42,497
Rym: that caused all sorts of trouble, but then I finally got that to work and it didn't help.

66
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:49,980
Rym: No Okay, but I recorded a conversation and I figured I could deal with those little issues talking to Jim.

67
00:04:50,784 --> 00:04:53,439
Rym: So tonight just now a little while ago.

68
00:04:53,701 --> 00:04:59,160
Rym: This is why this episode is late because normally we'd be done by now and we just be talking about the cool interview we had.

69
00:05:00,525 --> 00:05:01,760
Rym: We start our little I chat.

70
00:05:02,221 --> 00:05:10,779
Rym: we're having some trouble because as we learn later, there are a whole bunch of terrible bugs in the newer versions of I chat and Apple won't say anything.

71
00:05:11,222 --> 00:05:22,083
Rym: but it seems like the internet is a buzz with people complaining and Saying that oh you have to use this back level of QuickTime and this different back level of I chat and this version of OS X Tiger.

72
00:05:22,103 --> 00:05:26,960
Scott: the actual problem seems to be from from doing a bit of five minutes of research.

73
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:46,600
Scott: So I'm not a hundred percent sure this is right, but after five minutes of research apparently in some version of I chat they added some quality of service packets and that means that a packet will go to the router and say I need to be sent faster and it'll get sent faster and If the router doesn't support that it she just sends it normally.

74
00:05:47,122 --> 00:05:55,099
Scott: Apparently it was screwing up some routers making the packets get sent slower So that when the packets didn't go through fast enough.

75
00:05:56,341 --> 00:05:57,244
Scott: Apple gets a message.

76
00:05:57,305 --> 00:06:03,497
Scott: the I check gets a message saying your packet didn't go fast enough and then it gives up saying oh, it's not fast enough screw that.

77
00:06:03,517 --> 00:06:09,575
Scott: I Wonder what are these programmers at Apple writing this offer?

78
00:06:09,655 --> 00:06:10,800
Scott: What the hell are they thinking?

79
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,619
Rym: Well one why were they trying to you?

80
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:22,833
Rym: I mean, it's fairly common knowledge among internet professionals that the vast majority of any QoS metadata is Ignored at best by the majority of the world.

81
00:06:22,853 --> 00:06:28,640
Rym: Mm-hmm QoS is Effectively impossible on the internet because the Internet's the Wild Wild West.

82
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:33,635
Rym: Why should I who has a router in some company somewhere let someone else tell me?

83
00:06:33,655 --> 00:06:35,300
Rym: Hey my packets important.

84
00:06:35,381 --> 00:06:42,280
Rym: Please let me through fast because if that worked Everyone in the world would tell their packets to say that and then you've defeated the purpose.

85
00:06:43,068 --> 00:06:46,171
Rym: No one plays nice on the internet So QoS doesn't work, but I'm not gonna.

86
00:06:46,191 --> 00:06:51,280
Rym: that's not the topic for today And I'm sure none of the anime fans care about the inner workings of the Internet's.

87
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:52,901
Scott: But

88
00:06:53,262 --> 00:07:06,333
Rym: anyway, despite that we had some glitches with you know, actually connecting in I chat due to this weird Bandwidth QoS problem, but we eventually got it to work and we're talking with Jim and it's going really well And he's a really cool guy and

89
00:07:06,374 --> 00:07:07,139
Scott: he was really nice.

90
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:18,792
Rym: Yeah, like we asked him all the questions we had that we weren't gonna bother with on the interview But we just wanted to know and Walt Walt Scott's talking to him I'm setting up everything and then alright, we've got the audio chat going.

91
00:07:18,932 --> 00:07:20,056
Rym: I've got garage band open.

92
00:07:20,197 --> 00:07:25,987
Rym: I got a podcast ready I hit record and The little nice dialogue doesn't pop up.

93
00:07:26,127 --> 00:07:28,616
Rym: It just starts recording as though there's.

94
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:29,639
Rym: no I chat going on.

95
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:39,515
Scott: It seems to be the case that if you have to start the audio chat with someone else You have to be the inviter in order to get the recording to start now.

96
00:07:39,695 --> 00:07:40,760
Scott: No one else invites you.

97
00:07:40,982 --> 00:07:47,579
Rym: It doesn't seem to record though I think I got it to work that way with James and Lisa But I'm not a hundred percent sure.

98
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:52,220
Rym: I'll have to do some testing with whoever is willing to run I chat and play with me later.

99
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,520
Scott: Yeah, this cannot be confirmed or denied by the internet.

100
00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:00,700
Scott: It's just a good guess because we were never able to get around that bandwidth issue when we started the chat.

101
00:08:00,902 --> 00:08:03,020
Scott: So we could never test both circumstances.

102
00:08:03,862 --> 00:08:09,896
Rym: Yes, but bandwidth aside garage band just ignored the thing and it didn't give me an error or anything.

103
00:08:10,036 --> 00:08:19,852
Rym: and the Apple documentation said Oh, it'll just work and there's absolutely no indication of what order you'd have to do anything or any possible problems you might run into.

104
00:08:19,872 --> 00:08:24,249
Scott: and Like they don't give you any more controls or options.

105
00:08:24,731 --> 00:08:27,760
Scott: all you can do is push the one button they give to you.

106
00:08:28,402 --> 00:08:33,679
Scott: It's like if there was a giant factory and the giant factory had one control big red button.

107
00:08:34,243 --> 00:08:36,294
Scott: And you hit the big red button and a car comes out.

108
00:08:36,336 --> 00:08:37,059
Scott: It's a car factory.

109
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,288
Scott: I just decided that you hit the button again.

110
00:08:39,347 --> 00:08:40,171
Scott: a car comes out.

111
00:08:40,412 --> 00:08:43,878
Scott: you hit the button again a car comes out you hit the Button a car doesn't come out.

112
00:08:44,502 --> 00:08:48,980
Scott: What can you do besides jam that big red button a million times and then kill yourself?

113
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:50,727
Scott: You don't have any other controls.

114
00:08:50,908 --> 00:08:51,771
Scott: That's all they give you.

115
00:08:51,811 --> 00:08:57,209
Scott: they made it easy and as a result They made it impossible to do anything different.

116
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:01,140
Scott: if something goes wrong figure out what goes wrong or anything.

117
00:09:01,665 --> 00:09:20,280
Rym: Now to extend that a little bit further I want to because Scott's analogy here is really good and I want to extend it because People have really seemed to express some confusion as to what I mean by Context when I'm talking about max and why the fact that max now especially not so much OS X But the applications like garage band and I chat are so contextual.

118
00:09:20,943 --> 00:09:25,180
Rym: But they're contextual in such a bad way that it just frustrates me to no end and causes trouble.

119
00:09:25,681 --> 00:09:28,870
Rym: the red button has one context the context.

120
00:09:29,211 --> 00:09:36,012
Rym: the default context meaning a context is like a Scenario or a point of view in this context.

121
00:09:36,112 --> 00:09:37,317
Rym: I hit the button a car comes out.

122
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,828
Rym: now Let's say next to the button There is a big lever and the levers.

123
00:09:41,868 --> 00:09:45,020
Rym: to the left it says car and if it's to the right it says SUV.

124
00:09:45,762 --> 00:09:48,128
Scott: So this yes, so the same control.

125
00:09:48,148 --> 00:09:53,621
Scott: the button does multiple things depending on different Contexts.

126
00:09:54,022 --> 00:09:55,165
Rym: now context is fine.

127
00:09:55,286 --> 00:10:00,240
Rym: I mean almost every computer program in the modern world uses context and that's very important.

128
00:10:00,441 --> 00:10:02,185
Rym: That's how you eyes work on.

129
00:10:02,225 --> 00:10:06,898
Rym: contextual interfaces are the cornerstone of modern gooeys and modern computing.

130
00:10:07,599 --> 00:10:09,971
Rym: now Say we've got the red button and the lever.

131
00:10:09,991 --> 00:10:11,077
Rym: this is car and SUV.

132
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:14,029
Rym: great I can look at the lever and see what state I'm in.

133
00:10:14,109 --> 00:10:18,427
Rym: I can see what context I'm in and from that I can know What the red button is going to do.

134
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,900
Rym: if I hit the red button and an SUV comes out.

135
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,540
Rym: But I wanted a car I can look and say oh the thing has to point to car not to SUV.

136
00:10:26,442 --> 00:10:27,589
Rym: Let's say that lever is hidden.

137
00:10:27,992 --> 00:10:34,299
Rym: Let's say instead of a lever there's a dude sitting in a glass room above the factory and he's watching me.

138
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:40,659
Rym: and If my hats on forward, it's an SUV button, but if my hats on backwards, it's a car button.

139
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:42,330
Scott: There's no way for you to know.

140
00:10:42,672 --> 00:10:43,860
Rym: that's what Apple seems to be.

141
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,221
Rym: Well, not.

142
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:50,177
Rym: that's what GarageBand and I chat and all these I life applications seem to be doing.

143
00:10:50,457 --> 00:10:54,900
Rym: they're super contextual But they never directly tell you what context you're in.

144
00:10:55,501 --> 00:11:02,618
Rym: Thus behavior is often unexpected or seemingly random and because there's no feedback There's no way to know what's going on or how to fix it.

145
00:11:03,261 --> 00:11:08,380
Scott: It's like if you have this side panel open and you click this button then the button does this.

146
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:18,600
Scott: But if you have this track selected and drag something into the side panel Then it does something different than if you had this track selected and you drag something into the same side panel.

147
00:11:19,322 --> 00:11:24,459
Scott: If I drag something into a panel, it should do the same thing no matter what else is going on every time.

148
00:11:25,491 --> 00:11:30,614
Rym: but anyway We as a result did not get to interview at least on the air.

149
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:44,980
Rym: Jim Vowles sorrow Though we're going to try to schedule something again in the future Once we figure out a way to make this work probably involving Skype, which is a non Apple software Which works very nicely even though it was developed by the Kazaa guys.

150
00:11:45,544 --> 00:11:53,618
Scott: While they were evil in back in the day They were very good at programming evil and they programmed a very good Skype and eBay.

151
00:11:53,678 --> 00:11:59,097
Scott: some other good Programmers bought it and made it non evil and Skype is awesome for now.

152
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:12,217
Rym: Yep So we're probably going to try to use that now, of course Jim This was like his last free night before he goes off on a flurry of conventions and leave and fun So we might not actually catch him until after Otakon at this point.

153
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:12,920
Scott: That's fine.

154
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,984
Scott: We'll get a whole bunch of.

155
00:12:14,104 --> 00:12:16,132
Scott: we can just not go to the con feedback panel.

156
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:20,749
Rym: Yeah, and it'll be pretty cool Yeah, but definitely look forward to it.

157
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:24,159
Rym: We'll keep you appraised because from what little we got to talk to him He's a great guy.

158
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:28,940
Rym: I think he'll really be able to tell you a lot of interesting things about Otakon and anime conventions in general.

159
00:12:29,603 --> 00:12:42,226
Scott: Yeah, especially the difference between Otakon and every other anime convention Which is something a lot of people don't understand and I'd rather have him explain it than me Even though I understand it perfectly now as a as a nice Bonus or a consolation prize.

160
00:12:42,507 --> 00:12:45,920
Rym: because we don't have the audio interview what I'm going to do?

161
00:12:46,321 --> 00:12:51,140
Rym: I'm not gonna talk about it on this episode, but we'll probably talk about it on the next episode.

162
00:12:52,182 --> 00:12:53,669
Rym: We got before we did this.

163
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,100
Rym: he gave us and I we did a text interview over email.

164
00:12:56,481 --> 00:13:02,380
Rym: We told him what questions we wanted to ask him and he responded an email in case we didn't hook up audio wise.

165
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:09,259
Rym: So I'm gonna put that in the forums with a link for anyone who wants to get Just basically the text of a short interview we had with Jim

166
00:13:10,221 --> 00:13:20,118
Scott: Yep, so if you're interested in seeing what Jim Vowles had to say We have some of what he had to say in our forums and you should join them if you're awesome.

167
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,800
Rym: Yes So yes, it's definitely a trick to get you to join the forums.

168
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:33,611
Rym: But also he really had some interesting answers about such topics as why the cosplay this year is going to be in the arena Which I think is awesome Mm-hmm.

169
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:34,814
Rym: All right.

170
00:13:35,095 --> 00:13:37,140
Rym: But anyway, it's we're gonna hit some news.

171
00:13:37,823 --> 00:13:41,540
Rym: I don't have a news because I'm just kind of angry at my back even though I love my Mac.

172
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:42,283
Rym: I just it's.

173
00:13:42,765 --> 00:13:46,200
Rym: it's like a puppy that's really cute and then it pees all over my floor.

174
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,104
Rym: That is so exactly what it is.

175
00:13:48,124 --> 00:13:50,970
Rym: I still love the puppy, but why won't it stop peeing?

176
00:13:52,272 --> 00:13:55,363
Scott: And everyone else has puppies and they say they're so great, but they don't.

177
00:13:55,785 --> 00:13:57,050
Scott: my puppy doesn't pee on the floor.

178
00:13:57,351 --> 00:13:58,375
Rym: Yeah, you know what either.

179
00:13:58,616 --> 00:14:02,070
Rym: you're not trying to use your puppy to make podcasts.

180
00:14:07,951 --> 00:14:12,845
Scott: They're not trying to train their dog to sit up they're just letting it roam free, you know what.

181
00:14:12,925 --> 00:14:14,450
Rym: maybe they just can't smell puppy pee.

182
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,138
Scott: Maybe they can't smell puppy pee.

183
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,507
Scott: Maybe they don't give their puppy any water.

184
00:14:19,547 --> 00:14:20,109
Scott: So it doesn't pee.

185
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:22,269
Rym: You know what?

186
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:28,916
Rym: I'm not gonna pour water in my Mac and I never thought in all my life that I would say the words puppy pee.

187
00:14:29,378 --> 00:14:35,282
Scott: on a radio show I Just pictured a bumper sticker with a puppy peeing on an apple.

188
00:14:35,302 --> 00:14:38,522
Rym: I Just picture a puppy peeing.

189
00:14:39,432 --> 00:14:40,660
Rym: Hey, I've dealt with puppies.

190
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:42,230
Scott: lift up one leg next to the tree.

191
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,393
Scott: It's all good.

192
00:14:43,413 --> 00:14:49,229
Rym: a a herd of Irish setter puppies like little tiny puppies took me out once.

193
00:14:50,451 --> 00:14:55,855
Rym: Okay, I'll tell that story some other day if we do a show on dogs But these puppies just took me down.

194
00:14:55,956 --> 00:15:01,330
Rym: Anyway, I don't have a news which is fine because rims news Rym is angry at Apple.

195
00:15:01,731 --> 00:15:16,370
Scott: Yes flash news flash Rym is still angry at Apple news at 11 And in fact, it is 11 because son of a bit running late My news Bill Gates is now slightly cooler because he is a pirate are.

196
00:15:17,011 --> 00:15:23,770
Rym: Now I want to note right now that the argument all the arguments about piracy and a little actual property.

197
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:28,870
Rym: I've just been turned a little bit on their head because Bill Gates the man who has the most money of anyone.

198
00:15:29,251 --> 00:15:35,050
Rym: He could buy a record company by musicians and he could buy to Hollywood period.

199
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,453
Rym: He could buy Everyone.

200
00:15:37,473 --> 00:15:41,046
Rym: he could buy everyone who's ever made music and hire them to make him music and play it.

201
00:15:41,087 --> 00:15:42,010
Rym: live for him every day.

202
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,578
Scott: You think like, you know rock stars are rich.

203
00:15:44,718 --> 00:15:47,045
Scott: Bill Gates could own every rock star.

204
00:15:47,085 --> 00:15:53,630
Scott: Bill Gates could buy and sell Michael Jackson Madonna the Rolling Stones the Beatles and everyone twice.

205
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:56,389
Rym: So, uh, what did Bill Gates just do?

206
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:01,124
Scott: Well, let me there was an interview between the Wall Street Journal and Bill Gates.

207
00:16:01,466 --> 00:16:02,670
Scott: Well, and yesterday.

208
00:16:02,871 --> 00:16:10,379
Rym: This is the kind of thing I expect from like a blogger who happened to allow me to read four lines So classic from this interview.

209
00:16:11,061 --> 00:16:11,322
Scott: ready.

210
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:17,266
Scott: Wall Street Journal says You watch physics lectures and Harlem Globetrotters on YouTube.

211
00:16:17,467 --> 00:16:18,029
Scott: question mark.

212
00:16:18,752 --> 00:16:24,930
Scott: Bill Gates says this social network thing this social networking thing takes you to crazy places.

213
00:16:25,914 --> 00:16:29,629
Scott: Wall Street Journal says but those were stolen, correct?

214
00:16:30,472 --> 00:16:33,628
Scott: Gates says Stolen is a strong word.

215
00:16:35,153 --> 00:16:37,507
Scott: It's copyrighted content that the owner wasn't paid for.

216
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:40,617
Scott: so yeah Yeah, yeah, mr.

217
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:44,870
Rym: Bill Gates who has all the money in the world has no reason to pirate pirates.

218
00:16:45,151 --> 00:16:50,810
Scott: I guess Bill Gates is saying it's okay to do those Windows XP and Vista torrents on YouTube on Pirate Bay.

219
00:16:51,073 --> 00:16:52,190
Scott: So let's have that now.

220
00:16:52,270 --> 00:17:09,488
Rym: I guess that the the actual serious point I would make is that look at the industry and look at this commodity of intellectual property particularly audio and Not so much full movies but snippets of movies or short films or excerpts from things digital video TV episodes.

221
00:17:10,128 --> 00:17:20,186
Rym: now Bill Gates who has infinite money found it convenient trivial And in fact, he didn't even rethink that he was doing anything wrong to just watch this stuff.

222
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,190
Rym: It's so easy to do it.

223
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,115
Rym: It's so easy to get it.

224
00:17:22,214 --> 00:17:25,030
Rym: The most convenient way to get this media is to just download it.

225
00:17:25,432 --> 00:17:33,197
Scott: I think I would just release now one of my many many arguments against Copyright or at least modern copyright.

226
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:36,970
Rym: Yeah, we're not against people getting credit for their work or even from having a small monopoly.

227
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,320
Rym: We're against modern copyright law.

228
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:39,400
Rym: Yes.

229
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,690
Scott: Let me just release one of my arguments.

230
00:17:42,671 --> 00:17:44,095
Scott: There is supply and there is demand.

231
00:17:44,275 --> 00:17:45,940
Scott: What are the rules of supply and demand Rym?

232
00:17:46,522 --> 00:17:49,029
Scott: when supply goes down when supply goes down?

233
00:17:49,931 --> 00:17:50,653
Rym: Price goes up.

234
00:17:50,914 --> 00:17:53,242
Rym: Uh-huh when price goes up.

235
00:17:53,302 --> 00:17:55,550
Rym: Well price really is the floating factor here.

236
00:17:56,611 --> 00:17:58,758
Rym: When demand goes up price goes up.

237
00:17:58,999 --> 00:18:02,370
Rym: if demand goes up and supply goes down price skyrockets.

238
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:13,730
Rym: Now if supply is infinite Meaning supply keeps going up then prices keep going down and as the supply approaches infinity the price approaches zero.

239
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:14,594
Scott: Yes.

240
00:18:14,695 --> 00:18:17,470
Scott: Now, let's say the world had infinity apples.

241
00:18:17,653 --> 00:18:18,590
Scott: There was an apple tree.

242
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:27,917
Scott: They just spewed out so many apples that if at any moment at any time during your life you wanted an apple There that rare was Apple immediately.

243
00:18:28,338 --> 00:18:29,802
Scott: and they're just there's more of them.

244
00:18:29,822 --> 00:18:32,390
Scott: There's no running out of them now in this world.

245
00:18:32,672 --> 00:18:35,310
Rym: Could you ever sell just an apple to someone?

246
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:40,627
Scott: No Because if they wanted an apple they could just snap their fingers and one falls off the infinite apple tree.

247
00:18:40,647 --> 00:18:41,189
Scott: and there it is.

248
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:48,832
Scott: So apples cause nothing when they are an infinite supply and they don't cost anything to transport and it doesn't cost anything to get Them now.

249
00:18:48,872 --> 00:19:05,970
Rym: despite this the Apple economy does not collapse because while apples are infinite and free There are still businesses now for turning those apples into pies or baking those apples making those apples into caramel apples Stacking the apples up nicely in your pantry instead of having them fall randomly.

250
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:12,868
Rym: There are still opportunities for economic advancement despite the fact that a commodity that was once limited is now unlimited.

251
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,038
Scott: now Look at the world.

252
00:19:14,058 --> 00:19:14,727
Scott: We live in today.

253
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:19,481
Scott: Recorded digital audio and video is infinite in supply.

254
00:19:19,681 --> 00:19:22,810
Scott: Therefore it is worth Jack and shit.

255
00:19:23,671 --> 00:19:24,353
Rym: It's free.

256
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,497
Scott: it's free to distribute.

257
00:19:25,718 --> 00:19:27,264
Scott: it's relatively free to distribute.

258
00:19:27,304 --> 00:19:36,973
Scott: you pay the cost of internet connection Which is already paid for and once you've paid the entry fee you live in a separate world where digital audio and video cost Absolutely nothing.

259
00:19:37,534 --> 00:19:48,590
Scott: someone going around trying to sell digital and audio and video in a world in which they are free would be like someone Going around and setting up an Apple stand where apples are a dollar in a world of infinite apples.

260
00:19:48,831 --> 00:19:52,229
Rym: I like how you've slipped into this kind of like Sunday morning TV preacher.

261
00:19:52,249 --> 00:19:52,933
Rym: boys It's good.

262
00:19:53,074 --> 00:19:53,517
Scott: Is it good?

263
00:19:53,577 --> 00:19:53,940
Rym: It's good.

264
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,470
Scott: I like it sound like a Sunday morning preacher.

265
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,668
Rym: I wasn't trying to keep doing this kind of whoa.

266
00:19:59,394 --> 00:20:00,898
Scott: I wasn't trying to.

267
00:20:01,078 --> 00:20:01,419
Rym: it was good.

268
00:20:01,459 --> 00:20:01,800
Rym: I liked it.

269
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:21,581
Rym: Okay, but anyway despite this there's still an economy around Audio, you can't sell the audio digital file because those are infinite but you can sell things like a live performance swag about the audio an interview a Compilation that's easy to get as opposed to the free ones.

270
00:20:21,601 --> 00:20:23,830
Rym: You can get you can sell your audio manipulating skills.

271
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:29,710
Scott: Let's say I'm an apple pie master, you know, the people want to hire me to make apple pies.

272
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,435
Scott: Let's say I'm a remixing master.

273
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:36,550
Scott: Someone doesn't have a remix as you know, and they want it, but it doesn't yet exist.

274
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:49,121
Scott: They pay me to take these free digital audios on the internet remix them into something new and great Which is then free, but I've been paid to make it not paid You know to give it out or for the work itself.

275
00:20:49,563 --> 00:20:51,168
Scott: I'm paid for the creation my labor.

276
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:55,573
Rym: now Let's just talk about audio right now because video is Still a whole.

277
00:20:55,673 --> 00:20:59,827
Rym: not so much video but movies and feature films are a whole nother beast for all.

278
00:20:59,887 --> 00:21:03,589
Scott: the real problem with them Is that they had they cost a lot more to make?

279
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:09,509
Scott: Modern high special effects full-length feature films where audio really doesn't cost anything to make.

280
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:14,390
Rym: yeah And we've got a lot of ideas on that that we really shouldn't get into on anime day.

281
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:23,989
Scott: yes, all I can say about that is that right now to make less than full-length feature film quality video is Cheap enough where anyone can do it and it's basically free.

282
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:36,400
Scott: However, but to make full if you want full-length feature movies You're gonna have to wait for the cost of producing them to go down or for now pay which luckily People are still paying enough to where movies keep getting made.

283
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,990
Scott: Yeah, cuz DVDs just seem to be worth it for some reason.

284
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:43,670
Rym: Yeah, I mean look people will pay the money for a DVD even though it would be almost trivial to pirate that movie.

285
00:21:44,051 --> 00:21:44,894
Rym: That says a lot.

286
00:21:45,456 --> 00:21:55,350
Scott: Yeah, there is also, you know, even today with the current downloading technologies Even the best pirated copy you can get from the internet is just not as good as a DVD.

287
00:21:55,833 --> 00:22:03,929
Scott: I mean, nah, the DVD rip is many many gigs Which no one gets and you don't get the extras and you don't get the surround sound and it just it's not.

288
00:22:04,129 --> 00:22:05,749
Scott: you know You're getting something for your DVD.

289
00:22:06,151 --> 00:22:06,251
Rym: now.

290
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:19,290
Rym: the argument people make that I want to address right now and it's so easy to squash at least for audio because The argument I always hear is but if there's no direct compensation like that that no one will make anything anymore.

291
00:22:19,651 --> 00:22:24,930
Rym: And I point out to you that Scott and I do a podcast four nights a week.

292
00:22:25,271 --> 00:22:34,450
Rym: We're pumping out hours and hours and hours of at least I think is pretty good audio content with Absolutely, not only no compensation, but no expectation of compensation.

293
00:22:34,931 --> 00:22:41,070
Scott: In fact, we discourage compensation and we have a Creative Commons license, which means you can remix this shit all you want.

294
00:22:41,171 --> 00:22:44,855
Scott: I'm surprised no one's made a Rym and Scott Funky remix track.

295
00:22:44,935 --> 00:22:54,142
Rym: I'm sure we've said enough words to where you could put the words together and make us say hilarious things Yes, or make a techno song and you know make the vocal tracks.

296
00:22:54,523 --> 00:22:58,737
Scott: Rym saying Rym doesn't give a shit Rym doesn't give or something like that.

297
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:05,832
Rym: as long as I'm wearing these I can cast two spells Simultaneously, there you go All right.

298
00:23:05,873 --> 00:23:07,843
Rym: That was the most inside joke we've ever said on the air.

299
00:23:08,064 --> 00:23:08,908
Scott: Well, is it really?

300
00:23:08,928 --> 00:23:17,992

00:25:27,412 --> 00:25:30,468
Rym: Well, I Africa - I know someone who knows someone who's living in Egypt.

351
00:25:30,509 --> 00:25:32,822
Rym: now I should ping him and tell him to listen to our show.

352
00:25:33,305 --> 00:25:33,969
Scott: Oh, that'd be great.

353
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:38,530
Rym: Anyway, yeah, so you're obviously listening.

354
00:25:39,012 --> 00:25:48,088
Rym: I'm sure many of you especially since it's anime day might have heard about us at anime next which is what we're going to talk About and if you did welcome, we're glad you saw our flyer or met us.

355
00:25:48,329 --> 00:25:51,670
Scott: Yes And right now we're gonna do the things of the day, which is every episode.

356
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,450
Scott: I already said we talked about something cool.

357
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,850
Scott: We saw on the internet one each one for him and one for Scott.

358
00:25:56,251 --> 00:26:12,689
Rym: So like I was saying my thing of the day is something that is really well known and to FARC and to a lot of Geeks, but it might have you might have missed over this one because it was kind of a flash in the pan I refer to lightning bolt lightning bolt lightning bolt lightning bolt lightning bolt sleep sleep death death death.

359
00:26:13,752 --> 00:26:14,436
Scott: That's a good one.

360
00:26:14,456 --> 00:26:20,301
Rym: Yeah, it's alright LARPing live-action role-playing which I want to say right now.

361
00:26:20,321 --> 00:26:21,545
Rym: I have nothing against.

362
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:22,870
Rym: I think it can be really cool.

363
00:26:23,552 --> 00:26:24,574
Scott: I think it's scary.

364
00:26:24,775 --> 00:26:29,648
Rym: Well, it can be really cool and I have nothing against it as an idea as a game.

365
00:26:30,952 --> 00:26:36,310
Rym: I have issue with many of the people I have met in my life who happen to do it.

366
00:26:36,751 --> 00:26:37,051
Scott: You know what?

367
00:26:37,091 --> 00:26:38,614
Scott: I think I think it's not even many.

368
00:26:38,654 --> 00:26:39,916
Scott: I think it's pretty much all.

369
00:26:40,257 --> 00:26:40,798
Rym: it's not all.

370
00:26:40,858 --> 00:26:46,054
Scott: it's like if you had A movie and the movie could be cool.

371
00:26:46,475 --> 00:26:57,029
Scott: But the problem is is the only people who ever go to see this movie are scary perverts and They jerk off to the movie all the time and no one else ever goes to see it.

372
00:26:57,311 --> 00:26:59,029
Rym: However, I would be cool.

373
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:07,532
Rym: I went to a gaming convention a long long time ago and they had a LARP D&D which was actually really really awesome Mm-hmm.

374
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:12,002
Rym: But anyway now there are some classes of LARPers just role-play.

375
00:27:12,303 --> 00:27:24,826
Rym: some of them think they're actually vampires or witches or whatever they happen to believe and some of them go out into the woods and hit each other with bafa weapons or Foam-covered weapon and some of them do all three of those things and more.

376
00:27:24,866 --> 00:27:31,044
Rym: now This is just a short video Someone took of a group of nerds and I say nerds as opposed to geeks.

377
00:27:31,084 --> 00:27:32,770
Rym: be and you'll see why when you are there nerds.

378
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:34,559
Scott: Oh, these are nerds now.

379
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,510
Rym: They're they're having some sort of D&D fight there.

380
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:45,963
Rym: It looks like some climactic battle and there's this one guy who's a wizard and he looks like like, you know Those SCA people the Society for consenting adults.

381
00:27:46,184 --> 00:27:47,349
Scott: I thought it was creative and a heck of a.

382
00:27:48,331 --> 00:27:54,270
Rym: You know what it could go either way it goes both ways like a bisexual yes - that was a joke.

383
00:27:56,033 --> 00:28:02,342
Rym: Now this guy he's For you get the vibe that he's one of them except those people are usually pretty cool.

384
00:28:02,803 --> 00:28:06,488
Rym: This guy is uh, You just have to see it.

385
00:28:06,772 --> 00:28:18,835
Rym: He's casting lightning bolt Which means he's running at this guy throwing tennis balls at him and yelling Lightning bolt lightning bolt lightning bolt lightning bolt lightning bolt and it's just a wizard can't even this is this is nerdy You ready for this already?

386
00:28:18,876 --> 00:28:21,850
Scott: You can't even cast lightning ball more than once every six seconds.

387
00:28:22,171 --> 00:28:24,983
Scott: He's obviously cheating or he's so high level.

388
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:26,470
Scott: He has some sort of metamagic feat.

389
00:28:26,832 --> 00:28:28,983
Rym: He could have a quick casting feats or something.

390
00:28:29,003 --> 00:28:29,606
Scott: That's what I said.

391
00:28:29,686 --> 00:28:33,122
Rym: metamagic feats Yeah, or it could be second edition where you can just make stuff up.

392
00:28:33,544 --> 00:28:34,729
Scott: It could be second edition.

393
00:28:36,412 --> 00:28:37,297
Scott: Then he could have haste.

394
00:28:38,001 --> 00:28:39,932
Rym: Oh real haste haste That's that's.

395
00:28:40,435 --> 00:28:43,510

00:28:44,712 --> 00:28:50,100
Scott: And then a vorpal sword and oh, yeah, I think that other guy had a verbal sword The other guy had freaking power word kill.

Scott: I went through a whole bunch of things today before I settled on one.

406
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,054
Rym: Yeah, he had something else.

407
00:29:37,135 --> 00:29:40,570
Rym: and then he found this while I was typing up the show notes for this episode.

408
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:43,581
Scott: Yeah, it was like at the last minute the best one came up now.

409
00:29:44,303 --> 00:29:45,788
Scott: Who knows the karate kid raise your hand.

410
00:29:47,711 --> 00:29:48,614
Scott: Really don't raise your hand.

411
00:29:48,714 --> 00:29:48,955
Rym: I'm not.

412
00:29:49,216 --> 00:29:50,661
Rym: I'm doing that a crane kick thing.

413
00:29:50,962 --> 00:29:51,885
Rym: Okay, I actually am.

414
00:29:52,085 --> 00:29:53,410
Scott: so I guess you're raising both hands.

415
00:29:57,899 --> 00:29:58,449
Scott: There he goes.

416
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:04,730
Scott: So there was a karate kid game for the NES and a whole bunch of kids who like the karate kid.

417
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:07,563
Scott: I actually didn't see the karate killed too much later in life.

418
00:30:07,703 --> 00:30:09,090
Scott: So I didn't like the karate kid.

419
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:15,830
Scott: But people who like the karate kid were kids obviously and they bought the NES game of the same name.

420
00:30:16,051 --> 00:30:18,590
Rym: I want to say right now that I played that game many times.

421
00:30:18,872 --> 00:30:25,306
Rym: I owned it and then I sold it back to Funko Land and Watching this video was one of the most cathartic experiences I've ever had now.

422
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:26,310
Scott: I'd never played this game.

423
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:29,449
Scott: I might have played this game once in an emulator, but that doesn't really count.

424
00:30:31,272 --> 00:30:34,324
Scott: I didn't even know I knew this game existed kind of like.

425
00:30:34,364 --> 00:30:39,385
Scott: I didn't specifically remember it But if you would have set asked me was there a karate kid NES game.

426
00:30:39,405 --> 00:30:43,802
Scott: I would have said yes, I Couldn't tell you anything about this game until watching this video.

427
00:30:44,385 --> 00:30:50,919
Scott: the kid basically And he seems like a cool kid, too Plays the karate kid NES game.

428
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:59,273
Scott: He gets pissed off at it with good reason and Then he explains why he is so pissed off in Hilarious fashion.

429
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:04,150
Rym: with video like this the best part is where he's talking about how easy it is to die.

430
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:15,710
Rym: now you keep falling into pits and enemies keep knocking into pits and you can't jump because when you jump enemies knock you into pits and Meanwhile, it just shows the guy falling into pits constantly despite playing as well as a human code.

431
00:31:15,851 --> 00:31:20,450
Scott: The last time he falls into a pit is just hilarious because he avoids it so many times before falling in.

432
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:26,887
Scott: And if you're a hard score old-school NES gamer and you see this you will go.

433
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:29,529
Rym: yes, yes Yes, that's exactly what it was.

434
00:31:29,695 --> 00:31:43,959
Scott: Yes And if you're not an old-school NES gamer if you're one of those kids where the first Final Fantasy you played had a number higher than five You know in the US Or you know a PlayStation to you is old.

435
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,950
Scott: PlayStation 1 is old school as far as you're concerned.

436
00:31:47,211 --> 00:31:50,002
Rym: Yeah, I mean to us the PlayStation 1. is this upstart.

437
00:31:50,303 --> 00:31:51,930
Rym: Yeah this punk kid that appeared.

438
00:31:52,331 --> 00:32:07,646
Scott: Yeah, or if you think Goldeneye is an FPS classic as opposed to Wolfenstein 3d or doom We lived in a world where the number one and number two gaming platforms were Nintendo and Sega Where when it was a rumor, there were only 16 bits in those days.

439
00:32:07,707 --> 00:32:12,683
Scott: back in my day We had 16 bits to run our video game systems.

440
00:32:13,003 --> 00:32:15,130
Rym: Yeah back in my he thought that was too many.

441
00:32:15,471 --> 00:32:16,595
Rym: We didn't have video games.

442
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:22,882
Rym: every morning our old man would take us out to the granny of mines and beat us with belts all Day, you know what and we liked it.

443
00:32:23,245 --> 00:32:23,929
Scott: That's right.

444
00:32:24,732 --> 00:32:29,790
Scott: But if you're a new school gamer at least newer school at least if we would consider you new school.

445
00:32:30,273 --> 00:32:32,911
Scott: If you're a punk kid as far as we're concerned Yeah Cuz we're.

446
00:32:32,931 --> 00:32:33,272
Rym: you need

447
00:32:33,312 --> 00:32:46,450
Scott: to watch this because then you will understand what NES gaming was like for the vast majority of NES games And you will see why you suck at video games because we beat these things

448
00:32:46,971 --> 00:32:51,126
Rym: Daily, I mean today like look at the new Mario game for the DS.

449
00:32:51,306 --> 00:32:54,218
Rym: you can save Your game.

450
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,509
Scott: I beat that thing in like a day or two.

451
00:32:56,951 --> 00:33:01,770
Rym: You don't in Mario 3 the best Mario ever as far as I'm concerned with.

452
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:05,370
Scott: Sometimes if I tried to beat Mario 3 first of all, it takes forever.

453
00:33:05,712 --> 00:33:07,622
Scott: Second of all, sometimes I can't beat it.

454
00:33:07,663 --> 00:33:12,699
Scott: Sometimes I die near the end Or I mess up my p-wing and then I don't have enough.

455
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,505
Scott: yep, I mean he wings.

456
00:33:14,866 --> 00:33:17,154
Rym: it used to be that Beating a game.

457
00:33:17,456 --> 00:33:21,190
Rym: it's not like now where you're pretty much guaranteed to beat the game if you play it for the records amount of time.

458
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:26,630
Rym: Back then beating a game was an event whereupon you called your friend down the street.

459
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:30,390
Rym: You don't care if it was 2 in the morning and you said oh my god, Joe you gotta go over here.

460
00:33:30,732 --> 00:33:32,964
Rym: I'm just about to be Final Fantasy 1. you got to see the end.

461
00:33:33,004 --> 00:33:33,246
Scott: Oh my god.

462
00:33:33,266 --> 00:33:33,467
Scott: Oh my god.

463
00:33:33,487 --> 00:33:33,748
Scott: Oh my god.

464
00:33:34,851 --> 00:33:39,550
Scott: Yeah, because the odds of all of your friends beating the same game we're next to nil.

465
00:33:40,112 --> 00:33:43,985
Scott: It's like everyone had Megaman 2, but I beat Megaman 2.

466
00:33:43,985 --> 00:33:44,406
Rym: Yep.

467
00:33:44,466 --> 00:33:45,630
Scott: No one else even came close.

468
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:46,836
Scott: They're busy playing other games.

469
00:33:46,937 --> 00:33:49,670
Rym: everyone specialized like Scott's the Mac master of Megaman 2.

470
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:52,790
Rym: But I am the only one in this household who can beat bionic commando.

471
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:57,521
Scott: I could be bionic commando if I tried now that because when I played bionic commando, first of all I never had it on the NES.

472
00:33:57,965 --> 00:34:01,562
Scott: second of all I didn't know you could level up until much until you showed me that.

473
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:06,290
Scott: now knowing that I can level up I could probably get significantly far by command.

474
00:34:06,372 --> 00:34:11,385
Rym: You can get to the end But I'll note that the levels with the flame at the end are not.

475
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:13,885
Scott: maybe I'd have trouble with the flame But I think I could beat the Hitler.

476
00:34:15,915 --> 00:34:16,788
Scott: You ever give it about Hitler?

477
00:34:18,553 --> 00:34:19,299
Rym: No, no, I haven't.

478
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,237
Scott: Okay, so Everyone needs to watch this thing of the day.

479
00:34:23,297 --> 00:34:26,230
Scott: It's very very important and very very amusing.

480
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:32,830
Rym: Alright now nominally we're gonna talk about anime next today, which it's gonna be a little short on the main bit.

481
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:37,248
Rym: We're gonna go a little short here for one because we weren't planning on talking about anime mag.

482
00:34:37,289 --> 00:34:39,248
Rym: next We're planning on interviewing Jim Bowles.

483
00:34:39,771 --> 00:34:52,429
Scott: But since we have to talk about anime next and we spent a bunch of time dealing with technology that sucks Apple Apple we now have to Cut this short because we're tired and I have to go to the city tomorrow for a concert.

484
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:53,857
Rym: Well, as do I but it's fine.

485
00:34:53,877 --> 00:34:56,047
Scott: How are we gonna do an episode tomorrow at some concert?

486
00:34:56,248 --> 00:34:56,409
Rym: shit?

487
00:34:56,449 --> 00:34:56,976
Rym: We might not.

488
00:34:57,545 --> 00:35:03,115
Rym: oh shit You know I don't think there's gonna be an episode tomorrow cuz we're not gonna get back home from New York City until like Late.

489
00:35:03,538 --> 00:35:05,269
Scott: Wow, there goes new listener week.

490
00:35:07,391 --> 00:35:11,245
Rym: Yeah, we're not gonna record an extra episode tonight, oh, yeah, I guess not we're not.

491
00:35:11,305 --> 00:35:12,750
Scott: I wish you would have thought about that before.

492
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,057
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

493
00:35:14,117 --> 00:35:17,922
Rym: Well, maybe we'll do an episode Friday to make up for it With people here.

494
00:35:17,942 --> 00:35:24,310
Rym: Yeah Stay tuned for a possible first use of our on the scheduled episode category.

495
00:35:25,052 --> 00:35:32,530
Scott: yeah, there might be a special GeekNights on Friday and if you only subscribe to one day of the week you won't see It.

496
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:37,170
Scott: you'll only see it if you subscribe to the total GeekNights or just go to the website and download that.

497
00:35:37,251 --> 00:35:45,010
Rym: Yeah, that works, too Yeah, but it works out because honestly anime next is a great con, but we don't have a lot to say about it.

498
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:49,610
Rym: That's particularly insightful or different from what we'd say about any other good anime con we go to.

499
00:35:49,871 --> 00:35:54,821
Scott: Yeah, I don't think there's a lot to say about anime next itself But there is stuff to say about our experience at anime next.

500
00:35:54,982 --> 00:36:02,219
Scott: true because anime next for us Was different than other cons because we didn't know anyone there We didn't have plans and we only went for one day.

501
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:02,300
Scott: Yep.

502
00:36:02,862 --> 00:36:13,304
Rym: Also, this is the first con I've gone to in a long time at least anime cons because gaming cons are different but normal anime con Where I wasn't staff, I wasn't a panelist.

503
00:36:13,545 --> 00:36:22,418
Rym: I wasn't there with the press I was just me some schmuck who paid to get in and I was also some schmuck and so was our friend katsu Yep, and I got him a bit.

504
00:36:22,458 --> 00:36:23,141
Rym: It was a little weird.

505
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:37,041
Rym: Like I'd see punk kids about to cause trouble This was the biggest thing is I'd see a group of kids running through the hall with the sword or something Something bad was about to happen and I was about to get up and run over and go All right, you guys gotta settle down blah blah blah.

506
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:39,230
Rym: then I realized I don't have any right to do that.

507
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,113
Rym: I'm just some guy.

508
00:36:40,534 --> 00:36:41,919
Scott: you are just some dumb guy.

509
00:36:42,661 --> 00:36:44,467
Rym: I don't have some badge that gives me power.

510
00:36:44,488 --> 00:36:47,376
Scott: Yep So anime next.

511
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:49,723
Scott: we were only there on Saturday.

512
00:36:49,783 --> 00:36:52,090
Scott: We stayed pretty much most of Saturday.

513
00:36:52,412 --> 00:37:00,995
Rym: Yeah from when the con started pretty much like a half-hour into it I was kind of up for saying later and going to the rave and everything But katsu and Scott weren't so much.

514
00:37:01,737 --> 00:37:05,550
Scott: Yeah, it wasn't too into the rave and Scott had to drive home.

515
00:37:05,651 --> 00:37:09,900
Rym: so I don't really feel bad for Avoiding the rave even though I kind of like this is.

516
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,710
Scott: the drive there was less than perfect.

517
00:37:12,071 --> 00:37:15,746
Rym: Yeah driving to this convention, which is hate driving in Jersey.

518
00:37:16,048 --> 00:37:16,590
Rym: It's in the metal.

519
00:37:16,751 --> 00:37:23,524
Rym: I hate driving in Pennsylvania a lot more than I hate driving in Jersey Because at least in Jersey if you can get to the Garden State, you're okay.

520
00:37:23,925 --> 00:37:24,768
Scott: at least art for ours.

521
00:37:24,788 --> 00:37:25,430
Scott: We're concerned.

522
00:37:25,671 --> 00:37:27,517
Rym: Yeah, who goes anywhere else in Jersey?

523
00:37:28,219 --> 00:37:33,943
Rym: people do yeah, we don't do actually probably will soon but anyway Yep, now getting to the Meadowlands.

524
00:37:34,144 --> 00:37:35,370
Rym: We've gone there for well.

525
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,760
Rym: I've been there for three conventions and Scott's been there for two.

526
00:37:38,402 --> 00:37:41,812
Rym: We never fail to have trouble getting there Mm-hmm.

527
00:37:42,233 --> 00:37:44,502
Rym: It's just it's a somewhat obtuse place to get to.

528
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:51,410
Scott: I think what happened is he wanted to get off exit 17 But there was traffic and I didn't see the exit sign and there was a road that was closed.

529
00:37:51,531 --> 00:37:54,429
Scott: But it wasn't really closed and it totally threw us off.

530
00:37:55,033 --> 00:37:57,769
Scott: So we had to go across a bridge turn around come back.

531
00:37:58,091 --> 00:38:08,069
Scott: There wasn't an exit 17 on the way back had to get off the road drive around on random roads Turn around in a commuter lot until eventually I was like, hey, there it is.

532
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:10,959
Rym: Yeah Just by luck the first uber con I went to.

533
00:38:10,979 --> 00:38:14,713
Rym: I got lost and it was like 2 in the morning and I ended up Just driving back.

534
00:38:14,753 --> 00:38:15,556
Rym: I like the Takani.

535
00:38:15,596 --> 00:38:21,860
Scott: at least now we know our way around the Meadowlands Mall Plaza Hotel convention area.

536
00:38:22,161 --> 00:38:25,648
Scott: Yeah, so if we're ever there again We know how to get in and out.

537
00:38:26,432 --> 00:38:33,709
Rym: Now the main guests of honor at anime next which actually was cool because we actually listen to them talk And usually I don't go to panels.

538
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:41,448
Scott: I mean I went to panels my first Otakon at least, you know famous guest panels and now I tend to not go to them because I don't find them so interesting.

539
00:38:41,468 --> 00:38:43,814
Scott: but Well, we went to one.

540
00:38:44,335 --> 00:38:50,436
Scott: Yeah the first time in a long time that this was our Rintaro and Masao Mariyama Mariyama.

541
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:50,737
Scott: Yes.

542
00:38:51,118 --> 00:39:01,450
Rym: Mariyama is gonna be at Otakon - he's he's making the rounds him now If you don't know cuz this is the kind of thing the anime world order guys They'll probably yell at us if we get it wrong, but don't yell at us, please.

543
00:39:02,017 --> 00:39:03,912
Scott: just we're gonna Notables.

544
00:39:04,493 --> 00:39:24,642
Rym: the things that Rintaro worked on include a Galaxy Express 999 bunch of Captain Harlock stuff Metropolis X I'm not gonna mention it Final Fantasy Legend of the Crystals, which is Not his fault Phoenix Dagger of Kamui one of the Phoenix anime.

545
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:26,890
Rym: Yeah all sorts of stuff like that.

546
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,843
Rym: He worked alongside Osamu Tezuka back in the day.

547
00:39:29,963 --> 00:39:31,088
Rym: who is the god of?

548
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:33,098
Rym: in fact It says here in the con book god of manga.

549
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:33,500
Scott: Yep.

550
00:39:33,761 --> 00:39:35,530
Scott: Osamu Tezuka is the god of manga.

551
00:39:35,771 --> 00:39:42,218
Rym: I mean I am in the process of getting all his manga except astro boy and I want to say that in our case That is not an opinion.

552
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:46,805
Rym: That is the accepted Nomenclature of everyone in the world who knows about manga.

553
00:39:47,207 --> 00:39:48,577
Rym: Yes No one is.

554
00:39:48,597 --> 00:39:50,550
Rym: I mean no one disagrees on that point.

555
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:58,293
Rym: I defy any of you to disagree on that point because we'll seek the anime world order guys on you and they'll find the truth Of kicking your ass

556
00:39:58,835 --> 00:40:06,297
Scott: and I will throw my volumes of Tezuka manga at you and you will feel the lump on your head And you will die in a fire.

557
00:40:06,941 --> 00:40:15,163
Rym: now the other guy Murayama parakeets Monster the TV show which I didn't like the new vampire hunter D X metropolis.

558
00:40:15,825 --> 00:40:17,510
Rym: Oh, I didn't realize he was gunslinger girls.

Scott: He's the.

561
00:40:19,682 --> 00:40:20,869
Scott: he's basically a producer.

562
00:40:21,332 --> 00:40:22,497
Scott: Rintaro is a director.

563
00:40:22,517 --> 00:40:40,140
Scott: So Rintaro makes specific shows and he directs them and Murayama is the producer of madman studios which made shows like try gun and and Yep, jubei-chan, perfect blue, card cap or Sakura Sakura Some stuff for the anime tricks he had to hand in.

564
00:40:40,401 --> 00:40:42,649
Scott: yeah, I think they produced the new Nana show.

565
00:40:43,272 --> 00:40:44,676
Rym: Yeah, Nana which I love.

566
00:40:44,796 --> 00:40:47,987

Scott: Gainax All those big anime studios madman's one of the biggest.

570
00:40:57,299 --> 00:40:59,765
Rym: now two things about their panel is that one.

571
00:41:00,106 --> 00:41:08,595
Rym: they showed us a Video clip of a whole bunch of openers to shows shows that weren't out yet in America shows Americans shouldn't know about.

572
00:41:08,676 --> 00:41:11,105
Rym: they presented as a. here's what we're working on right now.

573
00:41:11,225 --> 00:41:12,430
Rym: Here's the cool stuff from Japan.

574
00:41:12,531 --> 00:41:15,069
Scott: Here's the cool stuff that's on TV right now in Japan that we made.

575
00:41:15,331 --> 00:41:20,148
Scott: We've seen all of their shows that every show that they showed we knew about and had seen.

576
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:23,219
Rym: in fact We're watching regularly multiple numbers of them.

577
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,349
Rym: That is correct except Black Lagoon, which I have almost no interest in.

578
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:30,370
Scott: Yeah, Black Lagoon and we watched one episode and that was that we didn't even watch the whole episode.

579
00:41:30,551 --> 00:41:30,852
Scott: We did.

580
00:41:31,193 --> 00:41:32,800
Scott: we'll review that in some show coming up.

581
00:41:33,162 --> 00:41:34,990
Rym: Yeah ice once con season winds down.

582
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:37,629
Rym: So after Otakon, we're gonna start reviewing anime again.

583
00:41:37,851 --> 00:41:41,709
Scott: We'll probably crunch like a whole bunch of anime per show because we'll do all the crappy ones.

584
00:41:42,372 --> 00:41:43,798
Scott: It don't require a lot of talking.

585
00:41:44,441 --> 00:41:46,248
Rym: Yeah, cuz I think Nana is gonna get its own episode.

586
00:41:46,268 --> 00:41:48,409
Scott: at this point I think it definitely is right when it's done.

587
00:41:48,691 --> 00:41:53,292
Rym: In fact a quick aside because people have actually been asking me and we kept saying we do it But we're not.

588
00:41:53,572 --> 00:41:54,134
Rym: well we haven't.

589
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:58,870
Rym: but right now what we're watching because people have wondered what what's going on?

590
00:41:58,910 --> 00:41:59,795
Rym: Do we still watch anime?

591
00:42:00,097 --> 00:42:02,190
Rym: We're watching Nana, which is a very good show.

592
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:05,740
Rym: I highly recommend it regardless of what kind of anime you like.

593
00:42:05,941 --> 00:42:09,210
Scott: You probably will like Nana, especially if you have a vagina.

594
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:11,928
Scott: You will like Nana a lot.

595
00:42:12,089 --> 00:42:13,294
Rym: now I point you have a penis.

596
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:17,349
Scott: you will only like Nana if you can forget that you have a penis for like five minutes.

597
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:23,610
Rym: Okay, I just I find that funny coming from Scott because this normally a show.

598
00:42:23,811 --> 00:42:26,130
Rym: I mean, this is a show about two girls living together in Tokyo.

599
00:42:27,171 --> 00:42:28,717
Rym: That's the kind of show Scott would say whatever.

600
00:42:28,777 --> 00:42:29,419
Rym: that's stupid.

601
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,113
Rym: He's watching it along with me and loving every second of it Not every second.

602
00:42:33,474 --> 00:42:36,606
Scott: Yeah some parts of it are a yeah, whatever you love it.

603
00:42:36,867 --> 00:42:37,750
Scott: It's really similar.

604
00:42:38,031 --> 00:42:40,301
Scott: It's a I always seem to watch like.

605
00:42:40,441 --> 00:42:49,690
Scott: I'm big on the intellectual Animes like the stuff that Satoshi khan makes and a big on the literary manga like the stuff Tezuka makes.

606
00:42:50,393 --> 00:42:54,710
Scott: But all the time I always have one show that's like a crap.

607
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:57,057
Scott: Not intellectual show.

608
00:42:57,077 --> 00:42:59,907
Scott: that's just stuff that I watch like.

609
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:10,803
Scott: I watch initial D And then I watch Goku Sen which is about a teacher who's in the mat Yakuza and then I watch back and this is really similar to back.

610
00:43:10,823 --> 00:43:13,390
Scott: So this is my non intellectual show of the moment.

611
00:43:13,933 --> 00:43:16,630
Rym: Yeah, I love Nana and I at least watch a couple episodes.

612
00:43:16,911 --> 00:43:18,437
Rym: I almost promise you'll like it.

613
00:43:18,497 --> 00:43:21,730
Rym: if you don't like it call in give us some feedback and tell us why not.

614
00:43:22,071 --> 00:43:30,062
Scott: Yeah, and some of the I think I was that's four and five maybe six are part recap But watch them anyway, because they're recap plus plus.

615
00:43:30,282 --> 00:43:32,690
Rym: Yes, like they're they're really worth watching.

616
00:43:32,791 --> 00:43:33,838
Rym: I can't stress that enough.

617
00:43:33,959 --> 00:43:35,590
Rym: just bear with it because it's worth it.

618
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:39,261
Scott: There's payout and there's also the Nana manga, which I haven't read.

619
00:43:39,281 --> 00:43:40,927
Scott: I probably not going to.

620
00:43:40,947 --> 00:43:42,030
Scott: maybe I'll look at it in the store.

621
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:43,155
Scott: Maybe I'll buy the first one.

622
00:43:43,236 --> 00:43:44,321
Scott: Maybe I'll get rimmed to buy it.

623
00:43:44,742 --> 00:43:44,903
Rym: Yep.

624
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:46,350
Rym: Now other things we're watching.

625
00:43:46,932 --> 00:43:49,762
Rym: We've been watching ergo proxy, but we've kind of tape.

626
00:43:49,782 --> 00:43:51,187
Scott: We have a shit ton of episodes.

627
00:43:51,207 --> 00:43:51,810
Scott: We got to watch him.

628
00:43:52,131 --> 00:43:53,316
Scott: Yeah, of course, I think it's licensed.

629
00:43:53,356 --> 00:43:56,590
Scott: So maybe the DVDs will come out before we ever watch it and we'll buy him instead.

630
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:58,196
Rym: That's why we kind of tapered off on that.

631
00:43:58,938 --> 00:44:04,577
Rym: I am watching a host club or on high school host club, which And Scott's watching it off and on with me.

632
00:44:04,597 --> 00:44:09,678
Scott: Yeah, it's basically I don't really care where the show goes Because I pretty much got everything in it.

633
00:44:09,718 --> 00:44:12,470
Scott: you get out of it in the first episode, but it's funny.

634
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:17,869
Scott: So, you know, I could watch any random episode to get the comedy and I don't really need to watch the whole show.

635
00:44:18,272 --> 00:44:20,130
Rym: Yeah, it was kind of like you were with a honey or a dango.

636
00:44:20,853 --> 00:44:22,835
Scott: Yeah, exactly of course honey or a dango after the.

637
00:44:23,296 --> 00:44:26,869
Scott: you really want to watch that show the first bunch of episodes and then stop.

638
00:44:26,909 --> 00:44:32,170
Scott: because Yeah, pretty much watching watch up until shows that one with like the H or something.

639
00:44:32,491 --> 00:44:36,944
Rym: Yeah, the four F for the 4h whether it's not for age the 4f.

640
00:44:37,205 --> 00:44:37,546
Scott: Yes.

641
00:44:37,686 --> 00:44:38,529
Scott: Yeah know the f4.

642
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:49,387
Scott: Yes, Emily and I were talking about this last night because she watched the honey or a dango has a manga and a TV drama Which she just watched and an anime and doesn't have a movie.

643
00:44:49,428 --> 00:44:57,710
Scott: maybe I don't know if honey or dong is one of those things that exist in every medium in Japan and it's It's hard to say which one's the best.

644
00:44:57,810 --> 00:45:00,383
Rym: Yeah, we'll write you a whole show on it cuz there's a lot we could say about.

645
00:45:00,423 --> 00:45:02,494
Scott: we'd need to go get some manga and Something I don't know.

646
00:45:02,655 --> 00:45:04,686
Scott: Yeah, it's also called boys over flowers.

00:45:04,988 --> 00:45:08,188
Rym: Yes Now also that what was that show?

Rym: We only watched one episode.

650
00:45:13,366 --> 00:45:14,310
Rym: I want to watch more.

651
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:17,530
Rym: I just haven't gotten around to it, but it's on the list of things that I'm going to be watching.

652
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:23,120
Scott: Yeah, I don't really have an interest in watching that show more than the first episode But I do want to know what to do with the mask is.

653
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:26,336
Scott: so if anyone knows the deal with that guy's mask Like is it a demon?

654
00:45:26,396 --> 00:45:26,779
Scott: Is it a?

Rym: Don't tell me it.

658
00:45:29,794 --> 00:45:31,621
Scott: don't tell rims out when he watches the show.

659
00:45:31,942 --> 00:45:32,544
Rym: Yep.

660
00:45:32,865 --> 00:45:34,030
Rym: I haven't had a chance to watch it.

661
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:34,756

00:45:34,958 --> 00:45:38,547
Scott: Yeah, also I bought according anime world order again.

663
00:45:39,851 --> 00:45:41,297
Scott: Listen, the anime world order podcast.

664
00:45:41,337 --> 00:45:41,658
Scott: Come on.

665
00:45:41,678 --> 00:45:42,762
Rym: We don't even need to play a promo.

666
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:43,324
Rym: Just listen to them.

667
00:45:43,345 --> 00:45:43,867
Rym: They're awesome.

668
00:45:44,067 --> 00:45:53,142
Scott: Yep I Bought all of master Keaton, which is eight DVDs for in 35 episodes I think for five bucks each at anime.

669
00:45:53,162 --> 00:45:54,488
Scott: next here we go back to anime.

670
00:45:54,509 --> 00:45:58,762
Scott: next If it's not good anime world order, I'm gonna kick your asses at Otakon.

671
00:45:58,782 --> 00:46:00,006
Scott: You made me spend 40 bucks.

672
00:46:00,287 --> 00:46:04,490
Rym: now speaking of that This is a nice tangent to get us back onto our main topic anime next.

673
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:05,133
Scott: That's why I did it.

674
00:46:05,535 --> 00:46:05,696
Rym: now.

675
00:46:05,877 --> 00:46:07,585
Rym: Scott said he bought all of master Keaton.

676
00:46:08,047 --> 00:46:13,688
Rym: in addition I've we bought between all three of us myself Scott and Katsu what like 40 DVDs?

677
00:46:15,031 --> 00:46:16,797
Scott: It was a lot of DVDs compared to.

678
00:46:16,897 --> 00:46:20,990
Scott: I really don't buy anime DVDs so often anymore since initial D and Gundam seed finished.

679
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:24,460
Scott: So the fact that I bought so many DVDs is crazy.

680
00:46:24,621 --> 00:46:25,805
Rym: now we're walking around in there.

681
00:46:25,865 --> 00:46:27,210
Rym: we see a guy was a huge sign.

682
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:27,813
Scott: It's no wait.

683
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:28,858
Scott: Let's start a little before that.

684
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:31,330
Scott: We don't really go to cons to the dealers rooms anymore.

685
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:33,821
Scott: The dealers rooms are kind of and we've seen everything they got.

686
00:46:33,902 --> 00:46:34,806
Rym: we're jaded old men.

687
00:46:34,866 --> 00:46:35,770
Rym: We go to a dealers room.

688
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:36,374
Rym: We're like man.

689
00:46:36,595 --> 00:46:39,892
Rym: seen it seen it crap crap seen it crap Exactly.

690
00:46:40,052 --> 00:46:45,330
Rym: We walked into this dealers room expecting like we're gonna walk in walk out and then we'll go on with our con business.

691
00:46:45,751 --> 00:46:48,039
Rym: We ended up buying a pile of stuff man.

692
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:55,950
Scott: They had the best deals on you know, PVC figurines And and they had really good deals on little keychains.

693
00:46:56,030 --> 00:47:00,267
Rym: Yeah, I have such an awesome set of Lupin PVCs that I can't get over it.

694
00:47:00,669 --> 00:47:03,926
Scott: Yep I bought a nice link thing for my cell phone.

695
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:09,927
Scott: I have a Zelda one link stabbing the sword on my cell phone.

696
00:47:09,967 --> 00:47:13,044
Rym: not the wooden sword Not the red sword the sword the sword.

697
00:47:13,144 --> 00:47:15,675
Scott: That's a geek fable It sure is.

698
00:47:15,996 --> 00:47:18,242
Rym: All right, and I got a little lockers club.

699
00:47:18,603 --> 00:47:23,058
Rym: It's not really lockers Klein, but Screw you all it's lockers Klein.

700
00:47:23,078 --> 00:47:23,581
Scott: That's right.

701
00:47:23,702 --> 00:47:25,250
Scott: Let him see destiny does not exist.

702
00:47:25,571 --> 00:47:27,684
Rym: Yeah, as far as I'm concerned cuz I bought a little cell phone dog.

703
00:47:27,704 --> 00:47:28,790
Rym: Lena's cute lockers Klein.

704
00:47:29,072 --> 00:47:30,341
Rym: I go to the people selling like.

705
00:47:30,462 --> 00:47:31,590
Scott: well, there were two lockers Klein's.

706
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:33,117
Scott: It was a cute one and a not-so-cute one.

707
00:47:33,137 --> 00:47:37,019
Rym: I was like, give me that cute lockers Klein and they're like, oh that one That's not lockers Klein.

708
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:38,050
Rym: That's uh, what's her name?

709
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:39,135
Rym: What's her name from destiny?

710
00:47:39,155 --> 00:47:39,738
Rym: blah blah blah blah.

711
00:47:39,999 --> 00:47:43,434
Rym: and they talked and talked and talked and talked and talked and you wish they wouldn't Have said that.

712
00:47:43,575 --> 00:47:44,539
Rym: and then they were like.

713
00:47:45,181 --> 00:47:47,430
Rym: and then they reached to give me the real lockers Klein.

714
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:51,010
Rym: I was like now just give me that other girl and I'll pretend it's lockers and they're like.

715
00:47:51,917 --> 00:47:52,864
Rym: You should watch destiny.

716
00:47:52,884 --> 00:47:53,529
Rym: It's really good.

717
00:47:53,892 --> 00:47:59,984
Rym: And then they gave me their list of reasons why it's good Which was identical to my list of reasons of why I don't want to watch it.

718
00:48:00,446 --> 00:48:01,410
Scott: What was their list of reasons?

719
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:02,085
Rym: They were like.

720
00:48:02,451 --> 00:48:11,969
Rym: it's it all the cool characters from before come back and you get to see them all doing stuff again and There's all sorts of lockers and Osterota and just fan service a crap.

721
00:48:13,331 --> 00:48:15,941
Rym: Not fan service like TNA but fan service like.

722
00:48:16,584 --> 00:48:26,130
Rym: I don't want to ruin Gundam seed But Gundam seed does a thing where a character appears near the end for no purpose other than the audience to go.

723
00:48:27,992 --> 00:48:54,670
Scott: Yep, it would be like in you know If you have a show and as a favorite character and you make a character that people like and then that character, you know for some reason in the plot dies or goes away or you know does it becomes a traitor or something like that and Then in Later in the show you just make hints to that character because it you know people like the character so much they get all excited.

724
00:48:55,336 --> 00:49:04,750
Scott: So it was like if you made a show Just doing things in the plot where the plot is there only to make fans happy and not to have a decent plot.

725
00:49:05,334 --> 00:49:07,629
Scott: That's what the kind of fan service are talking about now.

726
00:49:08,071 --> 00:49:12,430
Scott: It's like if someone just wrote a fanfic of Gundam seed and call the Gundam Z destiny.

727
00:49:13,312 --> 00:49:23,565
Rym: Yeah, I mean apparently Gundam seed destiny had these other characters But no one cared about them and eventually they just brought all the original characters back in Great, that means they didn't plan it from the beginning.

728
00:49:23,626 --> 00:49:29,203
Rym: and yeah Yeah, but anyway, we bought a pot while we're buying all this crap in the dealers room.

729
00:49:29,223 --> 00:49:29,564
Rym: Just bye.

730
00:49:29,604 --> 00:49:29,724
Rym: Bye.

731
00:49:29,764 --> 00:49:29,885
Rym: Bye.

732
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:30,025
Rym: Bye.

733
00:49:30,085 --> 00:49:30,186
Rym: Bye.

734
00:49:30,226 --> 00:49:30,386
Rym: Bye.

735
00:49:31,148 --> 00:49:34,800
Rym: and then We see a big sign five dollar DVDs.

736
00:49:35,041 --> 00:49:37,790
Rym: and I think all right, that's got to be a pile of crap.

737
00:49:38,111 --> 00:49:39,175
Rym: But let's go check it out.

738
00:49:39,196 --> 00:49:41,666
Rym: There might be a gem a lot of gems.

739
00:49:41,786 --> 00:49:42,730
Rym: They were all gems.

740
00:49:43,051 --> 00:49:44,255
Rym: It was good anime.

741
00:49:44,275 --> 00:49:47,204
Rym: that just happens to be five dollars because it's old.

742
00:49:47,666 --> 00:49:48,950
Scott: got all of master Keaton.

743
00:49:49,254 --> 00:49:50,390
Rym: I got a someday dreamers.

744
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:54,630
Scott: I would have gotten three DVDs of crying Freeman, but they didn't have DVD number two.

745
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:57,924
Scott: So I only got DVD number one and I let DVD number three just sit there.

746
00:49:58,165 --> 00:49:59,330
Rym: I got a bunch of random Lupin.

747
00:49:59,793 --> 00:50:11,230
Rym: I almost bought all of MIDI got it many goddess But I wasn't sure if it was five dollars per DVD in the set or five dollars for the set And I think anything that was packaged on its own was five bucks.

748
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:14,250
Rym: The reason I was Larry's that I also saw many goddess DVDs separately.

749
00:50:15,151 --> 00:50:21,177
Rym: Oh and like it was too crowded to ask the guy and I was gonna go back and ask later when there was no one Around but I never had time for that.

750
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:22,021
Rym: So I didn't get it yet.

751
00:50:22,081 --> 00:50:23,687
Scott: Nay under seven five bucks a DVD.

752
00:50:23,747 --> 00:50:26,967
Scott: Yep Hi, Bonnie Renmei five bucks a DVD.

753
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:31,770
Rym: Yep So I bought basically the first episode of everything I could grab because I love owning the first episodes of things.

754
00:50:32,353 --> 00:50:33,359
Rym: Yep, well the first DVD.

755
00:50:34,003 --> 00:50:34,949
Scott: what else do they have there?

756
00:50:35,911 --> 00:50:37,097
Scott: Lots of old robot shows.

757
00:50:37,177 --> 00:50:44,108
Scott: I bought kitchen core if you don't know about kitchen core Aka geo armor in the United States, but it's kitchen core.

758
00:50:44,148 --> 00:50:48,644
Scott: Fuck you That is a fucking awesome show and you should get it.

759
00:50:48,684 --> 00:50:50,170
Scott: It comes in just one little box.

760
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:53,983
Scott: I think there's two or three DVDs in it with the whole show maybe six episodes.

761
00:50:54,023 --> 00:51:00,597
Scott: I think it is freaking awesome steam powered Nazi fighting robot action.

762
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:03,725
Scott: it is worth every penny five bucks.

763
00:51:04,046 --> 00:51:05,289
Scott: It's like I was robbing the guy.

764
00:51:06,072 --> 00:51:07,337
Rym: Yeah, every DVD I picked up.

765
00:51:07,378 --> 00:51:10,410
Rym: I thought I don't really want this but it's only five bucks.

766
00:51:11,553 --> 00:51:13,789
Scott: But yeah, so dealers room.

767
00:51:14,091 --> 00:51:19,510
Scott: Surprisingly jaded old men who don't care about dealers rooms found that to be one of the highlights of the con.

768
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:24,964
Rym: Also, I'll note that there was a lot of Death Note merchandise in the dealers room.

769
00:51:24,984 --> 00:51:27,210
Scott: Oh, was there ever I expect by Otakon?

770
00:51:27,391 --> 00:51:30,206
Rym: It's just gonna be a sea of Death Notes and people dressed up as Misa.

771
00:51:30,247 --> 00:51:30,548
Rym: Misa.

772
00:51:30,589 --> 00:51:32,394
Scott: now Gotta watch out for those.

773
00:51:32,414 --> 00:51:33,538
Scott: are you cosplays?

774
00:51:33,579 --> 00:51:35,627
Rym: That's the action is the first one I see.

775
00:51:35,667 --> 00:51:36,329
Rym: I'm gonna interview him.

776
00:51:36,792 --> 00:51:38,685
Scott: Yeah, how long did it take you to make this?

777
00:51:38,866 --> 00:51:39,350
Scott: You're awesome.

778
00:51:41,091 --> 00:51:41,876
Scott: Wow, that's awesome.

779
00:51:41,896 --> 00:51:42,459
Scott: You're awesome.

780
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:43,404
Rym: In fact, I should carry.

781
00:51:43,444 --> 00:51:44,228
Scott: how awesome are you?

782
00:51:45,911 --> 00:51:46,171
Scott: All right.

783
00:51:46,212 --> 00:51:46,532
Scott: Let's see.

784
00:51:46,793 --> 00:51:53,773
Scott: I'll give you $1 if this costume also does the upside down e inside out e and the twisty and the twisty Alright.

785
00:51:54,054 --> 00:51:57,430
Rym: now anyway aside from that we went to some of the panels now.

786
00:51:58,332 --> 00:52:01,490
Rym: We didn't go to many just because you know, we're only there one day and we didn't have that much time.

787
00:52:01,932 --> 00:52:02,757
Rym: But there was a panel.

788
00:52:02,857 --> 00:52:05,170
Rym: Oh, we want a revolution now.

789
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:14,055
Scott: the reason I went to this panel is because the guy on the panel was a fellow podcaster named Ian Levenstein and he does a Podcast called geek speak.

790
00:52:14,076 --> 00:52:15,119
Scott: I think his website.

791
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,567
Scott: I'm not a hundred percent sure is geek.

792
00:52:17,587 --> 00:52:20,797
Scott: speak geek Dot-com or speak geek speak.

793
00:52:21,057 --> 00:52:21,459
Rym: Oh great.

794
00:52:21,479 --> 00:52:22,000
Rym: That's helpful.

795
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:25,309
Scott: No, I think it's speak geek speak dot-com speaking geeky.

796
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:26,988
Scott: But geeky, let me try it.

797
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:30,626
Scott: You can just keep talking about the panel while I type in his URL.

798
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:32,797
Rym: Yeah Well, it was just.

799
00:52:33,602 --> 00:52:35,190
Rym: I don't know why this panel existed.

800
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:40,249
Rym: I mean no offense to the guy but it was just him talking about the Wii and what bothered me and this.

801
00:52:41,139 --> 00:52:41,969
Rym: Things like this bother me.

802
00:52:42,010 --> 00:53:02,990
Rym: It bothers me when there is someone who isn't an authority and isn't even pretending to be an authority But because they're behind the magic table of being a panelist or a staffer as opposed to a con goer Everyone who isn't on that side of the table Assumes that they're an expert and treats them as though they're like this deferred to authority figure.

803
00:53:03,237 --> 00:53:08,190
Rym: Yes Well, we're asking him questions that there's no way he could have known the answer to and he was just making it all up.

804
00:53:08,491 --> 00:53:11,610
Scott: The other thing is he doesn't know any more than we do.

805
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:15,190
Scott: In fact, we knew more than he did because we read the internet a lot more than he does.

806
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:21,762
Rym: We had to call it like we wouldn't talk to him after and he was cool but we had to call him out and point out that he had.

807
00:53:21,843 --> 00:53:34,028
Rym: they had two examples of you know, Sony's missteps with HD and blu-ray and everything and the two examples that they talked about were both Completely debunked and disproven by the internet hours after being reported.

808
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:38,810
Scott: Yep His website is speak geek speak calm and he does some podcasts.

809
00:53:39,272 --> 00:53:43,130
Rym: Yeah, we're just busting his balls because of the panel he did he seems like a cool guy.

810
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:43,653
Scott: Yeah, he is.

811
00:53:43,693 --> 00:53:46,530
Scott: He is a pretty cool guy and his podcasts aren't so bad.

812
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:51,330
Scott: He even had a nice rant on one of his recent podcasts even though I forget the topic of the rant.

813
00:53:52,674 --> 00:53:54,893
Scott: Oh I think it was the.

814
00:53:55,234 --> 00:54:01,233
Scott: it was a rant about how people just dismiss all manga as a genre as opposed to a Medium.

815
00:54:01,374 --> 00:54:02,079
Rym: that's a good rant.

816
00:54:02,301 --> 00:54:03,267
Scott: Yeah, it was a pretty good rant.

817
00:54:03,549 --> 00:54:06,561
Rym: now There was a panel we wanted to go to but didn't just because it was late at night.

818
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:08,950
Rym: bad anime bad.

819
00:54:09,313 --> 00:54:13,877
Scott: I've seen that panel listed in a lot of Con schedules, but I'd never gone to.

820
00:54:13,957 --> 00:54:19,094
Scott: it is if anyone out there has been to a bad anime bad panel Tell me about it.

821
00:54:19,194 --> 00:54:25,484
Scott: Tell me if it's worth going to because again anime world order has made it Unnecessary to check out.

822
00:54:25,524 --> 00:54:33,909
Rym: bad anime God I still it's like it's gnawing at my brain that I have to see the unedited version of that.

823
00:54:33,969 --> 00:54:34,150
Rym: now.

824
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:37,605
Scott: No, you don't know I have to bad Rym bad.

825
00:54:37,826 --> 00:54:38,569
Rym: I've gotta know.

826
00:54:39,251 --> 00:54:40,416
Rym: Okay, it's the end.

827
00:54:40,797 --> 00:54:43,509
Rym: I'll see it and then I'll kill myself and that'll be the end of it.

828
00:54:43,851 --> 00:54:47,910
Scott: Yep, the cosplay we didn't go to but it actually looked like there was some good stuff going on.

829
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:54,350
Rym: We walked in at the back and peeked in it in the middle of one of the most elaborate cosplays I've ever seen.

830
00:54:55,072 --> 00:55:04,156
Rym: Yeah, it was like this choreographed Utena set to music thing and the costumes were really good and I didn't know what was going on because I missed the beginning of It but it was cool looking it.

831
00:55:04,336 --> 00:55:07,185
Scott: usually choreographed fight cosplays are terrible.

832
00:55:07,205 --> 00:55:14,287
Scott: They're the worst cosplays imaginable But this one actually wasn't so bad Like I was like, oh, all right.

833
00:55:14,327 --> 00:55:15,532
Scott: Good job That was that was.

834
00:55:16,114 --> 00:55:19,884
Scott: see that should be the gold standard for the average cosplay.

835
00:55:20,185 --> 00:55:27,186
Scott: if you go to a cosplay at a con Every cosplay should be at least that good and then the winners should be even better.

836
00:55:27,567 --> 00:55:30,037
Scott: if it was like that I would go to every cosplay ever.

837
00:55:30,097 --> 00:55:33,069
Scott: The problem is most cosplays are far far worse than that one.

838
00:55:33,712 --> 00:55:36,910
Rym: Yep, though we have friends who do good cosplays and there are good cosplays out there.

839
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:41,487
Scott: There are good cosplays do exist, but the most cosplays do not good.

840
00:55:41,507 --> 00:55:45,932
Scott: Yeah English lose Unpossible.

841
00:55:45,992 --> 00:55:46,595
Scott: be.

842
00:55:46,615 --> 00:55:50,330
Rym: do at least with Otakon this year because the cosplay is going to be in the arena.

843
00:55:51,212 --> 00:55:53,510
Rym: I think they're gonna mitigate a lot of the line problems.

844
00:55:53,651 --> 00:55:58,470
Rym: So it might be more worth it for people who we would normally say ask if the cosplay to go check it out.

845
00:55:59,152 --> 00:55:59,894
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

846
00:56:00,195 --> 00:56:00,676
Rym: It's still.

847
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:10,350
Scott: it's both appealing to me to go to the cosplay in the arena, which will be insane But it's also appealing to hang out in the convention center while it's empty because everyone else is at the cosplay.

848
00:56:11,551 --> 00:56:13,610
Scott: Now they're actually on Saturday night, which is happening.

849
00:56:14,152 --> 00:56:18,934
Rym: I'll also just note and anime next which seems to be a trend this year and all the cons I've been to so far.

850
00:56:19,416 --> 00:56:23,010
Rym: there has been a significantly increased furry and plushie presence.

851
00:56:23,672 --> 00:56:26,602
Scott: Super doll fee presents a lot of time presence.

852
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:28,790
Rym: Yeah, but yeah, we hentai has been on the rise for a while.

853
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:29,472
Rym: I've expected it.

854
00:56:29,573 --> 00:56:37,985
Rym: I haven't expected furries to explode so suddenly into con culture it the whole perverted Aspect of the con.

855
00:56:38,025 --> 00:56:46,451
Rym: right now I'm looking at one page of the panels anime next and half of them are hentai panels or here's one the pervy plushie Workshop.

856
00:56:46,792 --> 00:56:48,277
Rym: that can be nothing but horror.

857
00:56:48,558 --> 00:56:48,899
Scott: Yes.

858
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:49,560
Scott: Now.

859
00:56:49,621 --> 00:56:55,221
Scott: Here's the thing that gets me is back in the early cons I went to like the first couple years of going to cons.

860
00:56:55,743 --> 00:56:57,290
Scott: the cons had a hentai panel.

861
00:56:57,613 --> 00:56:59,089
Scott: They had people who liked hentai.

862
00:56:59,412 --> 00:57:04,882
Scott: They had a hentai showing possibly But everything that was like that was sort of in the back.

863
00:57:05,103 --> 00:57:06,086
Scott: it was toned down.

864
00:57:06,127 --> 00:57:07,130
Scott: it was not the focus.

865
00:57:07,311 --> 00:57:15,846
Scott: It was you know, it was pushed away hidden like yes, we do this But we don't like to talk about it as it should be now nowadays.

866
00:57:15,967 --> 00:57:16,810
Scott: It's the forefront.

867
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:19,819
Scott: They push it out in the open like come on to the hentai.

868
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:23,269
Scott: We're having a yuri con a yaoi con a furry con.

869
00:57:24,731 --> 00:57:26,256
Scott: Don't let's all be perverted.

870
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:31,993
Rym: Oh Scott furry cons are old and Steeped in tradition.

871
00:57:32,374 --> 00:57:37,750
Scott: Yes, but I'm saying now the anime cons are leaning more towards the furry cons the yaoi cons.

872
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:49,250
Rym: I think what it is and I'd love to do a whole show on this is that of all the geek fandoms It seems that anime is the most universal of the most rod spread or it has the most overlap with all of the other geek.

873
00:57:50,074 --> 00:57:53,590
Rym: So if you go to a gaming con, it's pretty much all gamers go to a comic con.

874
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:56,701
Rym: It's all comic people go to an anime con con.

875
00:57:56,962 --> 00:57:59,370
Rym: It's gamers and comic people and anime people.

876
00:57:59,691 --> 00:58:02,862
Scott: It's because there's the manga which tracks taps to the comics.

877
00:58:03,223 --> 00:58:05,270
Scott: There's the anime which taps to the video games.

878
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:06,132
Scott: There's the anime.

879
00:58:06,353 --> 00:58:12,550
Scott: there's the anime that taps to Japan which taps to anything Japanese, which includes video games and live-action cinema.

880
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:15,039
Rym: There's also the furries who just go because there's a whole bunch of geeks.

881
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,850
Scott: and there's sci-fi anime which taps to real sci-fi.

882
00:58:17,991 --> 00:58:19,910
Scott: It taps into every geekery.

883
00:58:20,834 --> 00:58:26,314
Scott: Other geekeries don't do that as well as anime does, you know I just I can't stop looking at.

884
00:58:26,515 --> 00:58:35,102
Rym: there's two plush workshops and I'm not gonna explain what plushies are But they're a little bit more sinister than just stuffed animals.

885
00:58:35,704 --> 00:58:35,925
Scott: Yes.

886
00:58:36,005 --> 00:58:44,535
Scott: Now the thing is is that The anime cons most of the attendees are hormone enraged Attention whoring high school kids.

887
00:58:44,696 --> 00:58:49,110
Rym: Why couldn't these cons have been around when I was a hormone raging kid exactly hot?

888
00:58:50,231 --> 00:58:56,070
Scott: So now old men go to these things and all they see is a bunch of really horny teenagers running around being pervert.

889
00:58:58,151 --> 00:59:01,610
Scott: Now I'm not gonna say they shouldn't do that because that's what I would have done when I was a kid.

890
00:59:01,811 --> 00:59:10,030
Rym: Yeah, plus the thing is when I go to a con and I see that I don't think damn kids I think yeah, those kids look like they're having a lot of fun and they're not in my way.

891
00:59:10,432 --> 00:59:17,070
Scott: Yeah, as long as they stay out of my way, you know The worst that they can do to me is make me cringe if I see them do something terrible.

892
00:59:17,372 --> 00:59:23,940
Scott: But even then I think yeah, that's something I would have done Yeah, but I also cringe to think oh, that's something I would have done.

893
00:59:26,411 --> 00:59:28,161
Rym: You were once a kid running around.

894
00:59:28,181 --> 00:59:29,770
Scott: that is true, but think about this.

895
00:59:29,971 --> 00:59:36,950
Scott: I was once a kid doing all the same stupid things But if I could travel back in time, I would prevent myself from doing every one of those stupid things.

896
00:59:37,391 --> 00:59:38,214
Scott: Teach myself straight.

897
00:59:38,555 --> 00:59:40,241
Rym: I tell myself to do more stupid things.

898
00:59:40,663 --> 00:59:43,114
Rym: the I don't regret anything in my life But there are.

899
00:59:43,134 --> 00:59:45,656
Scott: I don't regret anything at all But there are a lot.

900
00:59:46,039 --> 00:59:47,290
Scott: it would be so much more awesome.

901
00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:49,900
Scott: Imagine if I was as awesome as I am now and I was three.

902
00:59:50,081 --> 00:59:52,230
Scott: Yeah fear that fear that shit.

903
00:59:52,391 --> 00:59:59,748
Rym: See I would go back in time and tell myself to do a lot of the stupid things that I realized were stupid and didn't Do because by doing them I'd have more stories.

904
00:59:59,789 --> 00:59:59,930
Rym: today.

905
01:00:01,832 --> 01:00:06,899
Scott: I guess I would you know be doing a different set of stupid things and perhaps a lot of Awesome things.

906
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:07,890
Scott: instead of stupid thing.

907
01:00:08,031 --> 01:00:16,026
Rym: I missed out on a lot of things that were probably would have been really stupid to do But at the same time they probably would have ended up being awesome or I would have died.

908
01:00:16,106 --> 01:00:16,970
Rym: It would have died.

909
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:23,050
Rym: Yeah, I would have been stranded like I don't know in Alabama with no money in my cars missing.

910
01:00:24,031 --> 01:00:25,938
Scott: Let's talk a little bit more about anime next.

911
01:00:26,219 --> 01:00:38,650
Scott: the thing about anime next that I think is its best Feature and its worst problem is that it's too big for its location And I think they know this because it's one of the questions on their survey.

912
01:00:39,105 --> 01:00:43,985
Rym: Yeah I mean It's pretty much as big as it can be where it is and there's nowhere to move to.

913
01:00:44,105 --> 01:00:51,647
Scott: yes the meadowlands area Plaza place which is not you know giant stadium and the continent Airlines arena.

914
01:00:51,687 --> 01:00:54,292
Scott: It's down the road from that It.

915
01:00:54,573 --> 01:00:58,045
Scott: there's a little Expo Center there, which they use the entirety of.

916
01:00:58,687 --> 01:01:07,421
Scott: there is a Embassy Suites Hotel in which they use I think three rooms and There is a Holiday Inn in which they use the whole mess of rooms.

917
01:01:07,541 --> 01:01:09,729
Scott: They had the video games over there and all that.

918
01:01:11,151 --> 01:01:16,610
Scott: The problem with that is that if the weather was bad walking from building to building would have been a nightmare.

919
01:01:17,112 --> 01:01:20,404
Rym: Luckily, the weather was nice and there was a lot of cool hanging out outside.

920
01:01:20,504 --> 01:01:20,725
Scott: Yes.

921
01:01:20,785 --> 01:01:22,010
Scott: There was basically outside.

922
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:28,790
Scott: This is an outside con which is very interesting and unique in that, you know, people only went inside to do con events.

923
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:30,698
Scott: You only went in the Holiday Inn to play video games.

924
01:01:30,878 --> 01:01:33,850
Scott: You only went in, you know, the embassy to do a panel.

925
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:37,870
Scott: You only went in the main con center to go to the dealer's room or a main event.

926
01:01:38,272 --> 01:01:47,162
Scott: other than that you hung out outside where there was lots of cosplaying and Lots of DS playing and art drawing and all sorts of con hanging out.

927
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:47,584
Rym: Yep.

928
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:57,626
Rym: Once again a quick aside just to continually Rub it in the faces of PSP people because we can and we know you'll yell at us in the forum Someone PSP, I think yeah, one guy was carrying.

929
01:01:57,666 --> 01:01:58,330
Rym: He wasn't playing it.

930
01:01:58,390 --> 01:02:04,499
Rym: We've never seen anyone playing a PSP in public, but he was carrying it around open-lit Like to show people he had it.

931
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:16,387
Scott: meanwhile up in the video game hallway There were so many DS's that the wireless went down and we had to split up and form separate land parties and we went outside Into the grass and had us a good old time playing Mario Kart and Tetris.

932
01:02:16,749 --> 01:02:27,890
Rym: Yep We played some hellish Mario Kart and some awesome Tetris that we did Proved all these young punk kids that I am the supreme almighty god of Mario Kart and I did pretty good in Tetris.

933
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:29,729
Scott: But I think this one kid was actually better than me.

934
01:02:29,971 --> 01:02:32,889
Rym: He was really good because I died early in one round and I was watching him.

935
01:02:33,292 --> 01:02:34,583
Scott: I did win a whole bunch of rounds.

936
01:02:34,603 --> 01:02:40,460
Rym: you did you did Okay But he was the only one there who probably Could have at least broken even with you given enough time.

937
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:49,383
Scott: and as of any group of punk kids most of them are annoying and There's always one smart kid Who is you know reasonable social skills and it seems like a normal person.

938
01:02:49,644 --> 01:02:49,785
Rym: Yep.

939
01:02:49,885 --> 01:02:52,435
Rym: I forget all their names, but whatever They're just punk kids.

940
01:02:52,455 --> 01:02:53,159
Rym: They might be listening.

941
01:02:53,199 --> 01:02:54,364
Rym: We gave him GeekNights flyers.

942
01:02:54,646 --> 01:02:55,088
Scott: Oh, did we?

943
01:02:55,329 --> 01:02:58,429
Scott: Yeah Hey punk kids who played DS on the lawn with us.

944
01:02:59,395 --> 01:03:00,269
Scott: One of you doesn't suck?

945
01:03:01,172 --> 01:03:02,805
Rym: Yeah, you should all join to figure out who.

946
01:03:03,168 --> 01:03:04,647
Scott: yes That is that is what you should do.

947
01:03:05,374 --> 01:03:09,700
Scott: You should come to Otakon and meet us and I remember Kind of what the one who doesn't suck looks like.

948
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:12,030
Rym: so I can point him out, but there were so many DS's.

949
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:16,610
Rym: I mean we were sitting in that we panel which no offense dude, but it was kind of boring as hell.

950
01:03:16,671 --> 01:03:22,708
Rym: so we were picked out chatting and There are all these people out who were in the panel picked out chatting with us who were like this sucks and they left.

951
01:03:22,788 --> 01:03:27,890
Scott: well one Person was in the panel picked out chatting with us and one person was in the cosplay line picked out chatting with us.

952
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:36,558
Rym: And then one guy left the panel to go get in the cosplay line Because he didn't like the panel and he kept picked out chatting and he was like, come on You should leave join us join us in line.

953
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:39,267
Scott: and I said, uh, no, I don't want to see the cosplay.

954
01:03:39,448 --> 01:03:46,770
Rym: Yeah Not a big fan of the cosplay And I mean other than that the con was just a normal good con.

955
01:03:47,232 --> 01:03:51,490
Rym: I definitely recommend anyone who lives within a couple hours at least go for Saturday.

956
01:03:52,012 --> 01:03:54,302
Scott: Yeah, if you live see that's the problem.

957
01:03:54,322 --> 01:03:58,730
Scott: It seems to be with cons if they're far away You can get a hotel and go to the get the full experience.

958
01:03:59,053 --> 01:04:04,893
Scott: But if you live close by But not so close by you can drive back and forth Like if you don't live.

959
01:04:04,933 --> 01:04:21,230
Scott: if you live within a half hour, you can drive back and forth like two or three times a day But if you live more than an hour away, it's not worth it to drive back and forth Friday Saturday Sunday But it's also not worth it to get a hotel because you're so close so you can only really go for one day.

960
01:04:21,692 --> 01:04:32,830
Rym: Well, it's like my good friend Nuri when I went to an amazement and you know staff and all that there Despite the fact that she lives somewhat like really close to the con She had a hotel room that we all stayed in because it wasn't worth it to drive back and forth.

961
01:04:32,971 --> 01:04:35,909
Scott: Yeah, well if your staff and you have to stay all three days, you know.

962
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:38,670
Scott: Then you got to get the hotel room to make it easy and convenient.

963
01:04:38,991 --> 01:04:45,337
Scott: Yeah, but I imagine if she wasn't staff and you were just attending that con we still would add hotel room Depends how cheap the hotel is.

964
01:04:45,477 --> 01:04:46,782
Scott: if the hotel is really cheap dude.

965
01:04:47,023 --> 01:04:50,052
Rym: It's not New York City or Baltimore.

966
01:04:50,273 --> 01:04:52,682
Rym: hotels are cheap as dirt in most of the world.

967
01:04:52,963 --> 01:04:53,465
Scott: You like that one.

968
01:04:53,485 --> 01:04:54,810
Scott: We stayed in when we went to RIT.

969
01:04:55,111 --> 01:04:57,238
Rym: Oh my god, that was the second cheapest hotel.

970
01:04:57,258 --> 01:04:57,981
Rym: I've ever stayed in.

971
01:04:58,162 --> 01:05:00,510
Rym: and the actually nowhere near the crappiest.

972
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:03,942
Scott: No, no, it's probably the third or fourth worst hotel.

973
01:05:03,982 --> 01:05:04,423
Scott: I've stayed in.

974
01:05:04,704 --> 01:05:08,560
Rym: I stayed at a family in Somewhere in West Virginia.

975
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:10,730
Scott: I stayed at the Paramount Hotel.

976
01:05:10,831 --> 01:05:15,592
Scott: I'll take you to the Paramount Hotel sometime when we go down Route 17.

977
01:05:15,592 --> 01:05:25,270
Rym: I just want to note that this family Inn in West Virginia was the scuzziest place I have ever slept in my life and I have slept on the streets of New York City.

978
01:05:26,132 --> 01:05:29,473
Scott: I'll show you the Paramount Hotel next time we go down Route 17.

979
01:05:29,473 --> 01:05:33,610
Scott: The Paramount is something I could do a whole geek fable episode about the Paramount.

980
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:37,149
Scott: Seriously, I stayed there many times.

981
01:05:37,712 --> 01:05:38,414
Scott: Don't ask why.

982
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:41,083
Rym: all right, what else did we do at anime?

983
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:52,430
Rym: next we met the uber con staff Which I think we're gonna try to either do a live show at one or both of the uber cons and more importantly We're definitely gonna be running some games at these cons.

984
01:05:52,892 --> 01:05:56,907
Scott: If you go to uber con we will be running German board games all day and playing burning wheel all night.

985
01:05:57,168 --> 01:06:00,615
Scott: Yes That's what we're gonna be doing.

986
01:06:00,675 --> 01:06:01,398
Rym: that's pretty much it.

987
01:06:01,759 --> 01:06:04,650
Scott: maybe doing a panel yeah, maybe doing a podcast panel.

988
01:06:05,232 --> 01:06:07,859
Scott: We met the game station radio.

989
01:06:07,899 --> 01:06:10,126
Scott: guys were aggressively marketing their podcast.

990
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:13,216
Scott: I listened to it and It was okay.

991
01:06:13,256 --> 01:06:14,501
Scott: You can go listen to it.

992
01:06:14,541 --> 01:06:15,204
Scott: See if you like it.

993
01:06:15,345 --> 01:06:16,690
Scott: It's a. it's a video game podcast.

994
01:06:17,092 --> 01:06:18,497
Rym: Yeah, no, they were marketing.

995
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:19,100
Rym: I mean, we don't.

996
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,650
Rym: we really are uncomfortable promoting ourselves.

997
01:06:21,851 --> 01:06:27,610
Scott: It's weird like we made because we hate advertisers so much that becoming a salesman becoming a pusher.

998
01:06:28,053 --> 01:06:31,721
Scott: You know, we were complaining about pushers at Wizard World Philly.

999
01:06:31,742 --> 01:06:32,789
Scott: we can't be a pusher.

1000
01:06:33,654 --> 01:06:37,010
Rym: I mean I can sell like I could sell something to one person.

1001
01:06:37,311 --> 01:06:42,449
Scott: Yeah, like if I had a job, you know in a Best Buy selling computer parts, I could do that.

1002
01:06:43,013 --> 01:06:52,343
Rym: well, even like I you know I do this panelists and staff on all these cons and I've gotten into all these positions everywhere and I every time I interview for Jobs in the IT world.

1003
01:06:52,404 --> 01:06:59,883
Rym: I always get him It's I'm really good at selling myself and selling things I do to people as long as it's on a one-on-one basis and I'm talking to someone.

1004
01:07:00,505 --> 01:07:04,195
Rym: I don't feel comfortable Advertising to mass audiences.

1005
01:07:04,657 --> 01:07:06,363
Scott: You're just walking around saying listen to me.

1006
01:07:06,463 --> 01:07:06,844
Scott: Listen to me.

1007
01:07:06,945 --> 01:07:08,470
Scott: Listen to me feels like you're a spammer.

1008
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:09,709
Rym: Yeah, I feel like a whore.

1009
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:17,215
Rym: now these guys were just handing out their flyers and we wouldn't do that like we would like hand a flyer to one guy after We talked to him for a while.

1010
01:07:17,336 --> 01:07:20,067
Scott: or you leave them on a table and let people take them as they would.

1011
01:07:20,368 --> 01:07:25,528
Scott: Yep, and These guys they gave us their flyer like three times because we ran into them.

1012
01:07:25,568 --> 01:07:31,695
Rym: the third time I was like, dude, you've already given us - he's like, oh, yep Oh Well, there were some other podcast.

1013
01:07:31,715 --> 01:07:32,919
Rym: Yeah otaku generation.

1014
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:39,260
Scott: Yeah, they had a big panel there and they had lots of fancy equipment and I listened to part of one of their episodes.

1015
01:07:39,502 --> 01:07:41,049
Scott: You can go listen to that one for yourself, too.

1016
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:43,098
Rym: I like how you're.

1017
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:47,865
Rym: you're not passing your judgment But if this is we're already at war with one podcast.

1018
01:07:47,885 --> 01:07:54,330
Scott: those stupid moon masters You know those those sons of bitch moon masters were at war with the you know, those coast retards.

1019
01:07:54,411 --> 01:07:55,330
Rym: Well, I heard what they did.

1020
01:07:55,450 --> 01:08:00,270
Scott: I don't have any resources to go fight with any other podcast if we can't fight a war on two fronts.

1021
01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:01,133
Rym: Yeah, well, you know what?

1022
01:08:01,173 --> 01:08:02,799
Rym: I at least otaku generation.

1023
01:08:02,859 --> 01:08:04,686
Rym: They uh, they kicked my dog.

1024
01:08:04,887 --> 01:08:07,557
Scott: They kicked my dog My dog.

1025
01:08:07,719 --> 01:08:08,850
Rym: that's like the oldest thing.

1026
01:08:11,492 --> 01:08:13,770
Rym: Well, I'll kick my dog but we went in and talked to him.

1027
01:08:13,770 --> 01:08:18,832
Rym: We didn't really get a chance to stay for their panel because we had to go eat steak Steak at the Outback.

1028
01:08:19,073 --> 01:08:19,716
Scott: Yep, where do we?

1029
01:08:19,736 --> 01:08:24,130
Scott: lunch meat lunch at the cheeseburger something the place with the steel drum cheeseburger paradise.

1030
01:08:24,451 --> 01:08:25,295
Rym: We were so excited.

1031
01:08:25,335 --> 01:08:28,710
Rym: We're sitting there eating and then this guy comes out and sets up steel drums.

1032
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:30,582
Rym: It looks like he's gonna do some awesome steel drumming.

1033
01:08:30,723 --> 01:08:31,729
Scott: I love me some steel drumming.

1034
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:39,109
Scott: I'm gonna go download some on YouTube and and You know Pirate Bay and all that his steel drumming was pretty mad and it ended up just being real annoying.

1035
01:08:39,231 --> 01:08:46,006
Rym: Yeah, his steel drumming was mediocre at best But I gotta say the Outback will not cook steaks as rare as I want them.

1036
01:08:46,549 --> 01:08:49,461
Rym: Nope I was like give it to me as rare as you can and it was.

1037
01:08:49,903 --> 01:08:52,720
Rym: it was cooked at least three times as long as I wanted it to be cooked.

1038
01:08:52,741 --> 01:09:08,340
Scott: Yeah, anyway Is an interesting side note while we were sitting in cheeseburger paradise eating our amazing lunches there on the TVs was the World Cup, which is relatively interesting and some boxing which is you know boxing.

1039
01:09:09,203 --> 01:09:14,330
Scott: and then we got into a discussion about Mike Tyson and I think we're gonna have to talk about Mike Tyson in the future.

1040
01:09:14,410 --> 01:09:17,501
Rym: I think we're gonna do a whole Thursday show at some point on Mike Tyson.

1041
01:09:17,682 --> 01:09:20,069
Scott: really a whole Thursday on Mike Tyson.

1042
01:09:20,310 --> 01:09:22,221
Rym: You know what I could do a whole Thursday on Mike Tyson.

1043
01:09:22,724 --> 01:09:23,669
Scott: All right, maybe we should.

1044
01:09:24,091 --> 01:09:27,423
Scott: Especially I bet you there hasn't been a podcast ever about Mike Tyson.

1045
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:34,509
Rym: Yeah, unless maybe for a second I thought I wonder if we could get him on the show and the answer was no You don't want him on the show.

1046
01:09:36,151 --> 01:09:37,215
Scott: No, definitely not.

1047
01:09:37,274 --> 01:09:42,718
Scott: but he might have been mentioned on a sports podcast at some point You know in passing or he might have been.

1048
01:09:42,898 --> 01:09:50,946
Scott: Mike Tyson's punch-out was probably mentioned on a video game podcast But I don't think anyone's ever done like an annotated biography of Mike Tyson in a podcast.

1049
01:09:51,488 --> 01:09:54,010
Rym: in the very least We'll make a thing of the day a video of him fighting.

1050
01:09:54,138 --> 01:10:11,541
Scott: Yes all I can say now is that after watching Mike Tyson fighting on YouTube and some other YouTube videos of Mike Tyson and reading Mike Tyson's Wikipedia while he is a horrible horrible man, I now view him in a different light and Respect some aspects of his life.

1051
01:10:11,923 --> 01:10:12,124
Rym: Yes.

1052
01:10:12,184 --> 01:10:13,410
Rym: I mean to his credit.

1053
01:10:13,832 --> 01:10:24,555
Rym: I really think that a lot of the problems he had and the things he did were very much a result of the culture and The way he lived.

1054
01:10:24,575 --> 01:10:28,907
Rym: I mean he'd lived by beating people up and getting beat up and that didn't affect his brain so well.

1055
01:10:29,289 --> 01:10:36,933
Rym: in addition His childhood wasn't so great and a lot of people even when he was a professional took a lot of advantage of him because he Really didn't know.

1056
01:10:36,953 --> 01:10:39,866
Rym: Yep, and not to excuse the things he did.

1057
01:10:39,886 --> 01:10:42,376
Scott: No, no That's the last thing we're gonna do.

1058
01:10:42,898 --> 01:10:46,070
Scott: but you know the thing that I like it's like with Hitler.

1059
01:10:46,432 --> 01:10:49,128
Rym: I don't like what Hitler did but I understand why he did it.

1060
01:10:49,473 --> 01:10:55,990
Scott: Yep The thing I learned most about Mike Tyson and respect the most is the fact that he knew he was bad and stupid.

1061
01:10:56,351 --> 01:10:56,773
Scott: He knew it.

1062
01:10:56,833 --> 01:10:59,783
Scott: He you know, he was sitting there saying I'm a convicted rapist.

1063
01:11:00,104 --> 01:11:03,588
Scott: I'm a terrible guy, you know I'm not an eloquent man.

1064
01:11:04,455 --> 01:11:05,382
Scott: What do you want from me?

1065
01:11:05,623 --> 01:11:06,389
Scott: And I was like, huh?

1066
01:11:06,732 --> 01:11:07,661
Scott: At least he knows.

1067
01:11:07,681 --> 01:11:09,675
Scott: at least he you know He has balls to admit it.

1068
01:11:09,736 --> 01:11:27,974
Scott: and I realized if I was ever famous like that I would probably have to deal with some of the things he deals with because I'm too brutally honest and too open and Most famous people put up this fake thing and Mike Tyson doesn't do that and it for that one thing He's I guess better than Complete shit.

1069
01:11:28,295 --> 01:11:29,279
Scott: It's better than Hitler at least.

1070
01:11:29,962 --> 01:11:35,266
Rym: Yeah, but anyway to get off that tangent Mike Tyson anime anime anime.

1071
01:11:35,286 --> 01:11:36,130
Scott: next Mike Tyson.

1072
01:11:37,272 --> 01:11:52,441
Rym: I don't know what else we can say about anime next but if any of the staff are listening because We've found that most of the cons we go to all the staff either listen or end up listening Which seemed to start with Katsu Kahn, but you guys put on a really good con And I hope you find a way to deal with your space problem.

1073
01:11:52,661 --> 01:11:52,882
Scott: Yep.

1074
01:11:52,943 --> 01:11:54,770
Scott: The con was run very well.

1075
01:11:55,091 --> 01:11:56,977
Scott: There was no problems with the running of the con.

1076
01:11:56,997 --> 01:11:58,241
Scott: registration was smooth.

1077
01:11:58,642 --> 01:11:59,706
Scott: staff were courteous.

1078
01:12:00,027 --> 01:12:01,090
Rym: There was one problem.

1079
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:02,195
Rym: Actually, I want to talk about this.

1080
01:12:02,275 --> 01:12:05,750
Rym: Okay, we went upstairs to the gaming room because we wanted to play some games.

1081
01:12:05,991 --> 01:12:06,554
Scott: You are correct.

1082
01:12:06,574 --> 01:12:07,096
Scott: There was one problem.

1083
01:12:07,277 --> 01:12:10,110
Rym: The room smelled like horrible fanboy like I gagged.

1084
01:12:10,210 --> 01:12:13,083
Scott: This is the board gaming room not the video gaming room.

1085
01:12:13,163 --> 01:12:16,050
Rym: now also in the video gaming room They had two video game rooms.

1086
01:12:16,411 --> 01:12:17,837
Rym: One of them was a normal video game room.

1087
01:12:18,199 --> 01:12:24,869
Rym: the other room which was almost as big as the first room Was just a DDR machine and the air conditioning was turned on max.

1088
01:12:25,771 --> 01:12:26,495
Rym: They are geniuses.

1089
01:12:26,515 --> 01:12:27,238
Rym: There was no smell.

1090
01:12:27,399 --> 01:12:29,970
Scott: There was no smell that the room was filled with people.

1091
01:12:30,091 --> 01:12:31,399
Scott: There was one DER machine.

1092
01:12:31,419 --> 01:12:33,210
Scott: There was a crazy air conditioner.

1093
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:36,070
Scott: There's nothing else in the room, but DDR and it was perfect.

1094
01:12:36,391 --> 01:12:41,029
Rym: But the board gaming room smelled like a fanboy who had never seen a bar of soap.

1095
01:12:42,312 --> 01:12:45,270
Scott: Yet when he returned hours later, the smell was gone.

1096
01:12:45,290 --> 01:12:47,060
Scott: There was a warning sign on the door.

1097
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,487
Scott: The room was crowded full of people.

1098
01:12:48,528 --> 01:12:49,835
Scott: gaming There was and there were.

1099
01:12:49,875 --> 01:12:51,646
Scott: there was many Lysol's and for breezes.

1100
01:12:51,666 --> 01:12:56,010
Rym: Yep So either that I think they just kicked the dude out who smelled like an open asshole.

1101
01:12:56,472 --> 01:12:57,255
Scott: I think they must have.

1102
01:12:57,275 --> 01:12:58,620
Scott: there's no other explanation for it.

1103
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:01,050
Rym: Yeah, I really that's the one thing.

1104
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:15,289
Rym: I think all conventions to take a very strong stance on that because people who don't engage in basic human hygiene Really give anime fandom and well more so gaming fandom a bad name.

1105
01:13:15,671 --> 01:13:15,852
Scott: Yep.

1106
01:13:15,893 --> 01:13:18,630
Scott: Now I think you have the freedom to not bathe.

1107
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:20,530
Scott: Do you have the freedom to smell as bad as you want?

1108
01:13:20,610 --> 01:13:32,269
Scott: But as soon as you set your stink into my nose you have how they say Had you know, they're right to swing your fist ends in my face if your smell gets in my nose that's in my face.

1109
01:13:32,824 --> 01:13:35,861
Rym: No Yeah You can make the argument that what if someone puts on too much cologne?

1110
01:13:35,881 --> 01:13:38,070
Rym: or what if you just don't like their cologne or so?

1111
01:13:38,410 --> 01:13:38,571
Rym: Really?

1112
01:13:38,892 --> 01:13:43,388
Rym: My point is more that a convention is fully within its right to kick you out if you don't wash yourself.

1113
01:13:43,548 --> 01:13:47,350
Scott: Oh hells Yes Convention is has the right to kick you out for any reason whatsoever.

1114
01:13:47,411 --> 01:13:48,910
Scott: They can kick you out because they don't like that.

1115
01:13:48,950 --> 01:13:49,372
Scott: Look at you.

1116
01:13:49,674 --> 01:13:56,616
Rym: I like to say right now at any conventions that don't feel like to have the Moxie the Cajones, well, it's not so much conventions.

1117
01:13:56,756 --> 01:14:01,670
Scott: any conventions which has them as a whole has the moxie and the hutzpah to kick people out.

1118
01:14:01,831 --> 01:14:04,626
Scott: It's the individual staffers of the convention.

1119
01:14:04,666 --> 01:14:09,789
Scott: I'll tell you all right I've never seen a con guide that doesn't say we can kick your ass out.

1120
01:14:10,871 --> 01:14:11,332
Rym: I've done it.

1121
01:14:11,532 --> 01:14:12,754
Rym: and our anime club at RIT.

1122
01:14:12,774 --> 01:14:14,456
Rym: We kicked people out who smelled.

1123
01:14:14,837 --> 01:14:16,560
Rym: Yeah in no uncertain terms.

1124
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:19,138
Rym: and Anime anime net era.

1125
01:14:19,158 --> 01:14:19,982
Rym: god an amazement.

1126
01:14:20,143 --> 01:14:22,620
Rym: all these cons start with anime So I keep mixing them up.

1127
01:14:23,569 --> 01:14:32,646
Rym: I Mentioned to a few people that perhaps they should go take a shower Mm-hmm where they DDR players or obese people, uh, you know, they weren't obese.

1128
01:14:33,007 --> 01:14:33,810
Rym: They were punk kids.

1129
01:14:33,991 --> 01:14:35,842
Rym: They had been doing something and I'm not sure what.

1130
01:14:35,862 --> 01:14:47,279
Rym: oh Okay, I don't know if they were playing games or running around or what but they smell bad bad bad smell bad very bad.

1131
01:14:48,393 --> 01:14:50,636
Scott: Okay Can we go to bed now?

1132
01:14:50,676 --> 01:14:53,589
Rym: I had to go to the city tomorrow, yeah, I got to do post-production on this bastard.

1133
01:14:53,629 --> 01:14:58,239
Rym: now Once again, we would have had Jim Vowles.

1134
01:14:58,459 --> 01:14:58,921
Rym: We're sorry.

1135
01:14:58,961 --> 01:15:00,827
Scott: We didn't sorry to Jim Vowles.

1136
01:15:00,867 --> 01:15:01,670
Scott: He wasted his time.

1137
01:15:01,893 --> 01:15:02,748
Rym: He's an awesome guy.

1138
01:15:03,111 --> 01:15:13,590
Rym: we're giving the middle finger to Apple for wasting our time and Jim Vowles time and We'll do everything we can to have an interview with him either in the very near future or after Otakon.

1139
01:15:14,091 --> 01:15:17,000
Rym: Suffice yourself by going to our forums and reading the interview.

1140
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:26,849
Rym: We already did with him which will comment on next Wednesday if we don't have the actual live interview with him because I like to comment on that interview, but not right now.

Scott: Yep, I'm gonna.

1142
01:15:28,717 --> 01:15:31,990
Scott: we should make a post that says there won't be an episode Thursday or something.

1143
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:37,970
Scott: Or maybe we should make a little tiny mp3 saying sorry no episode Thursday and put it in the Thursday feed tomorrow.

1144
01:15:38,393 --> 01:15:39,866
Rym: Yeah, we can just do it Thursday when we get home.

1145
01:15:41,131 --> 01:15:42,215
