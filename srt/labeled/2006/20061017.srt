1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,051
Rym: It's Tuesday October 17th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,071 --> 00:00:16,720
Rym: We come out of our funk to bring you Japanese style versus puzzle games.

3
00:00:18,542 --> 00:00:19,557
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:21,161 --> 00:00:28,360
Rym: The sad fact about yesterday's show is that we did a much better show after the show while we were laying around talking.

5
00:00:29,102 --> 00:00:31,551
Scott: Well, I guess it's cuz we weren't being informative.

6
00:00:31,591 --> 00:00:45,139
Scott: We were just laying around talking which is I think Getting the idea from listening to a lot of podcasts and from listening to our podcast that the entertaining bit is when People are just laying around talking and not trying too hard.

7
00:00:46,043 --> 00:00:46,726
Rym: Well, it depends.

8
00:00:46,826 --> 00:00:49,236
Rym: I mean sometimes we've been informative and it's awesome.

9
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,580
Rym: I Think it was a combination of the topic and whatever.

10
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,400
Rym: But anyway, today is a much better day for today.

11
00:00:55,802 --> 00:01:02,689
Scott: If you if you show me a show that has never had a bad episode I mean, come on, seriously, even the greatest shows.

12
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,060
Scott: there's a bad episode of cowboy bebop that one with the aliens.

13
00:01:06,804 --> 00:01:07,529
Scott: It wasn't so hot.

14
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:08,494
Rym: It was fine.

15
00:01:08,515 --> 00:01:09,340
Rym: What are you talking about?

16
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,131
Scott: So you get the point is that we don't have to make every episode amazing.

17
00:01:13,151 --> 00:01:13,553
Rym: Yeah, we do.

18
00:01:14,215 --> 00:01:14,977
Scott: All right, whatever.

19
00:01:15,298 --> 00:01:23,176
Rym: more importantly I would like to point out because a lot of people seem to have noticed that the episode didn't appear properly in the feed last night.

20
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:25,249
Rym: Yeah, all Scott.

21
00:01:25,511 --> 00:01:35,107
Rym: Yeah, I forgot to attach the category I just want to note because the one time a while ago when I went to sleep without dealing with the show properly Scott raised holy hellfire about it.

22
00:01:35,688 --> 00:01:38,376
Rym: Yeah, so, uh, I just had to bring that up.

23
00:01:38,637 --> 00:01:41,571
Rym: Okay, that's all I'm not gonna rag on him because I've done it before now.

24
00:01:41,591 --> 00:01:42,858
Rym: We're in a level playing field again.

25
00:01:43,341 --> 00:01:44,204
Scott: I know you screw up.

26
00:01:44,244 --> 00:01:45,248
Scott: I can rag on you again.

27
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:47,778
Rym: Yeah until you screw up and then we're even again.

28
00:01:47,798 --> 00:01:48,300
Rym: exactly.

29
00:01:48,563 --> 00:01:49,656
Scott: So you're the only gets rag done.

30
00:01:51,305 --> 00:01:51,998
Scott: Cuz all your fault.

31
00:01:53,061 --> 00:01:58,948
Rym: Anyway more importantly we mentioned yesterday Probably my favorite thing ever now.

32
00:01:59,028 --> 00:01:59,991
Rym: I know I say that a lot.

33
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:01,736
Rym: But this is this is particularly special.

34
00:02:02,238 --> 00:02:03,000
Rym: my man scrote's.

35
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:15,016
Scott: Okay, so you're hanging out over the weekend and our friend was showing us this game magic pencil magic Pendul a game that now like a year to have.

36
00:02:15,056 --> 00:02:19,932
Rym: two years ago He says I got this awesome game that you need to see for the ps2.

37
00:02:20,453 --> 00:02:21,777
Rym: I'll bring it when I visit.

38
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:22,840
Rym: he visited.

39
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,059
Rym: He brought the game.

40
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:27,630
Rym: He did not bring a PlayStation 2 and none of us owned one.

41
00:02:28,212 --> 00:02:30,960
Rym: Oh, well, he says he'll bring it to Otakon.

42
00:02:31,622 --> 00:02:34,049
Rym: With the ps2 forgets the ps2.

43
00:02:34,691 --> 00:02:37,860
Rym: we go somewhere where we have a ps2 forgets the game.

44
00:02:38,623 --> 00:02:40,532
Scott: He basically failed to show us this game forever.

45
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:41,919
Scott: So finally we go to his house.

46
00:02:42,785 --> 00:02:44,579
Scott: So he shows us the game now.

47
00:02:45,363 --> 00:02:52,720
Scott: The way the game was described to me is that I thought you drew some sort of two-dimensional Monster and then it came to life and fought other monsters.

48
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,054
Rym: Apparently you draw a three-dimensional monster.

49
00:02:56,094 --> 00:03:01,416
Scott: three-dimensional monster But it's not quite as freeform as I had imagined.

50
00:03:01,496 --> 00:03:02,480
Scott: but you can do a lot.

51
00:03:02,701 --> 00:03:04,210
Rym: It's very freeform.

52
00:03:04,311 --> 00:03:05,820
Rym: You can do a lot of things.

53
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:10,217
Scott: It's not as free as I hoped but it was still very free because what you hoped for was impossible.

54
00:03:10,237 --> 00:03:12,145
Rym: with that level of Technology, I guess.

55
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:16,099
Scott: but where's the ps2 supposed to be able to control icvms with nukes on them?

56
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:23,465
Rym: Um Scott we got to the moon as the United States with something less powerful than my TI 85 Calculator before I overclocked it.

57
00:03:23,826 --> 00:03:25,792
Scott: I know but remember when they could.

58
00:03:25,852 --> 00:03:27,437
Scott: they didn't want Saddam to get ps2s.

59
00:03:27,477 --> 00:03:32,110
Rym: Yeah You know what that brought back a whole bunch of sad memories.

60
00:03:32,631 --> 00:03:39,496
Rym: Yeah, but anyway, yeah for all of our political leanings Clinton was awesome, but those weren't the best president's years.

61
00:03:39,657 --> 00:03:46,298
Scott: I'll say that anyway, so He finally shows us this game and he shows us all the cool monsters.

62
00:03:46,338 --> 00:03:46,720
Scott: He's made.

63
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:52,319
Scott: He's got like Godzilla looking thing and uh, no, there's a thing that looks like the big monsters from Nausicaa.

64
00:03:52,722 --> 00:03:53,608
Rym: Yeah, he made some.

65
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:54,636
Rym: really he made a monster.

66
00:03:54,656 --> 00:03:55,180
Rym: That was himself.

67
00:03:56,121 --> 00:04:00,344
Rym: Yeah, now the thing is the monsters look pretty cool but they were alright.

68
00:04:00,846 --> 00:04:07,744
Rym: and then he showed us how you draw a monster and the monsters he drawn became a Billion times more impressive.

69
00:04:07,784 --> 00:04:13,580
Rym: because I can't imagine doing something like that in 3d with an analog thumb nub.

70
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:17,510
Scott: Yeah, I mean if there was a study this game needs a DS for real.

71
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:21,279
Scott: cuz on the ps2 you're really limited by the interface.

72
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,280
Rym: Yeah, this game on the DS would make gangbusters.

73
00:04:26,322 --> 00:04:27,680
Scott: Anyway, it would go gangbusters.

74
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,213
Scott: He starts to draw a new monster to show us what a drawing a new monster is like.

75
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:37,496
Scott: he draws a blob with blob feet And blob arms and a blob head and we're like what the hell aren't you gonna draw like a penis?

76
00:04:37,837 --> 00:04:38,520
Scott: and he?

77
00:04:39,242 --> 00:04:43,640
Scott: In all the time of owning this game for years never drew a penis, can you believe that?

78
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,000
Scott: That would be the first thing that any reasonable person would draw.

79
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,034
Rym: Yeah I mean the DS proved to the world and I started a new thing.

80
00:04:51,054 --> 00:04:55,749
Rym: where if you are given an Electronic media where in you can draw something.

81
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:59,660
Rym: the first thing any human being will draw is a penis.

82
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,010
Rym: If you do not draw a penis you were not a human being.

83
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:08,480
Scott: even Gabe who draws day in and day out You know goes up in front of a class of little kids teaches them how to draw a funny cartoon.

84
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:09,808
Scott: And what is the first urge?

85
00:05:09,948 --> 00:05:11,880
Scott: don't drop penis don't drop penis don't drop penis.

86
00:05:13,221 --> 00:05:19,778
Rym: So now I will note though that he didn't really play the game a lot since the DS came out and the DS was really the beginning of that trend.

87
00:05:20,564 --> 00:05:23,540
Rym: Yeah, I guess it was because I mean before then there was the cock boat.

88
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,260
Rym: But other than that, I didn't really draw penises on a regular basis.

89
00:05:26,883 --> 00:05:31,865
Rym: I've drawn more penises since the DS came out and then the rest of my life combined That is true.

90
00:05:31,905 --> 00:05:36,600
Rym: Yeah, including the 11 to 14 year old years, which are key for penis drawing.

91
00:05:37,543 --> 00:05:38,746
Scott: They are indeed the era.

92
00:05:38,826 --> 00:05:43,360
Scott: in fact most penises is drawn but in our times there wasn't so much penis drawing.

93
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,193
Scott: There was a lot more stick figure with boobs drawing going on.

94
00:05:46,253 --> 00:05:46,614
Rym: Really?

95
00:05:46,775 --> 00:05:49,553
Scott: Yeah, at least in my town No one could really draw.

96
00:05:49,654 --> 00:05:50,480
Rym: there wasn't much drawing.

97
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,070
Rym: The thing we would always do is we draw stick figure wars.

98
00:05:53,331 --> 00:05:58,715
Rym: you draw like a thousand stick men with white heads Fighting a thousand stick men with blackheads and they all had guns.

99
00:05:59,016 --> 00:05:59,740
Scott: Well, that was racist.

100
00:06:00,202 --> 00:06:01,005
Rym: See it wasn't.

101
00:06:01,046 --> 00:06:08,320
Rym: so much racism is that we couldn't draw and the only way we could differentiate Stickman was to color in the head or not color in the head anyway.

102
00:06:09,422 --> 00:06:13,639
Scott: So he finally drew a penis in this game made a penis monster.

103
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:27,589
Rym: now Not only did he draw a penis but the whole room the whole front row crew who was there is sitting around Directing him like make the shaft longer make the head a different color make the balls brown and gnarly put some wrinkles on him Get some veins in there.

104
00:06:28,516 --> 00:06:36,617
Scott: in the end I thought it was done, but they continued to add a bunch of scraggly nasty hair And some varicose veins of varying color.

105
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:39,536
Rym: now I'll note that every now and then he could go into this thing.

106
00:06:39,557 --> 00:06:53,780
Rym: that would show you a rough idea of how it would look when it was walking when it was dancing when it was attacking when it was sad and When once it was mostly complete and he sets it to the dancing thing Scott who was staring at the screen?

107
00:06:54,121 --> 00:07:01,639
Rym: Rapturously the entire time with rapt attention says oh Yeah, oh, yeah.

108
00:07:02,603 --> 00:07:03,827
Scott: It wasn't oh, yeah like that.

109
00:07:03,907 --> 00:07:06,556
Scott: It was oh, yeah, like oh, yeah, it's awesome.

110
00:07:06,637 --> 00:07:07,580
Scott: It was freaking awesome.

111
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,530
Rym: It was more of a oh, yeah.

112
00:07:09,852 --> 00:07:11,320
Scott: No, yeah was no.

113
00:07:12,161 --> 00:07:13,853
Scott: Considering it was it was like Kool-Aid.

114
00:07:13,994 --> 00:07:22,931
Rym: Oh, yeah No Because after you said that the entire room turns and looks at you there is exactly eight seconds of silence And then we all died roughly.

115
00:07:22,952 --> 00:07:24,400
Scott: What does that say about you guys?

116
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,740
Rym: That we figured something out about your personal life, and it was hilarious.

117
00:07:29,822 --> 00:07:32,380
Scott: But I think it's awesome when there's a hilarious dancing penis.

118
00:07:33,341 --> 00:07:39,400
Rym: So we finally start playing the game and it just gets worse because first of all he names it scrotch in the game.

119
00:07:40,022 --> 00:07:40,845
Scott: It was a perfect name.

120
00:07:41,005 --> 00:07:45,040
Rym: I suggested testicles, you know a nice regal Roman sounding name king testicles.

121
00:07:45,374 --> 00:07:47,724
Rym: But testicles croats was good.

122
00:07:48,005 --> 00:08:05,649
Rym: and scrotch comes out and then this little girl comes out with her monster to fight our Monster and this little girl's monsters this little stuffed animal and the stuffed animal like runs over and bats at the penis and does a little bit of damage and then scrotch rears up and Does a horrible motion.

123
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:15,502
Scott: it's think of M bison psycho crusher You know turns horizontal flies through the air and bangs into the enemy only it's a headbutt in a in a in a penis Sort of way.

124
00:08:16,084 --> 00:08:21,221
Rym: it just leans down and BAM or it'll do a nice spin where it kind of whips the testicles around and hits It.

125
00:08:21,684 --> 00:08:22,529
Scott: yeah, it'll.

126
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:31,580
Scott: it'll spin around really rapidly You know just with the testicles Sort of like a helicopter blade only on the bottom and then whack the bad guy a few times with the nuts.

127
00:08:31,941 --> 00:08:40,220
Rym: Because the worst thing was that as the final touch at Kate's request They added a little bit of stretchy spooge kind of hanging down from the tip.

128
00:08:40,684 --> 00:08:44,868
Scott: That was kind of nasty Unnecessary if you ask me gratuitous.

129
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:48,000
Scott: one might say yeah, it definitely made it look uglier.

130
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:49,691
Scott: I mean it looks so nice and pristine.

131
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:51,060
Scott: before they added some of that shit.

132
00:08:51,181 --> 00:08:52,551
Rym: I gotta say it was a little disturbing.

133
00:08:52,591 --> 00:08:55,306
Rym: when he goes into the pasture You know where he keeps all his monsters.

134
00:08:55,386 --> 00:08:55,868
Rym: you see it.

135
00:08:55,908 --> 00:08:58,840
Rym: Just kind of frolicking in the grass and bounding around.

136
00:08:59,842 --> 00:09:01,319
Scott: Yeah, it was rather unpleasant.

137
00:09:02,462 --> 00:09:03,669
Rym: That is the story of scrotch.

138
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:09,179
Rym: I I implore Nintendo or anyone to make a game like that for the DS.

139
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:21,706
Scott: I Think the lesson learned is if you have a game that lets you draw a penis There's really no two ways around that now, it's really hard to avoid Alright news time.

140
00:09:21,987 --> 00:09:22,429
Scott: Yeah, okay.

141
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,312
Rym: We got some news.

142
00:09:23,774 --> 00:09:25,440
Scott: so my news there.

143
00:09:25,661 --> 00:09:33,216
Scott: You may not know this, but there's something called DS homebrew, and it's this whole Sorta.

144
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:39,839
Scott: Yeah, it's this group of people and this technology that allows you to do things with your Nintendo DS.

145
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:42,029
Scott: besides What Nintendo expects you to do with it?

146
00:09:42,109 --> 00:09:42,552
Rym: Hey Scott?

147
00:09:42,652 --> 00:09:44,180
Rym: Is it a witch's home?

148
00:09:45,943 --> 00:09:48,029
Scott: No, it is not a witch's homebrew.

149
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:51,838
Scott: I got another question is it about which is homebrew?

150
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:56,216
Rym: no maybe anyway style.

151
00:09:57,913 --> 00:10:07,440
Scott: So Basically what people would do is they would use the original was the pass me device You know which would allow you to take code from your computer and play it on your DS.

152
00:10:08,204 --> 00:10:21,240
Scott: But then they went on and they got better things like the m3 And you know they got different kinds that they put like flash cartridges in the GBA slot And they'd put like boot cartridges in the DS slot that would stick out of your DS.

153
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:25,040
Scott: None of these things were very elegant and none of them were elegant solutions.

154
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,736
Scott: You know they would work, and you could play NES roms SNES roms GBA roms DS roms.

155
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:36,616
Scott: You could also do a lot of software written for the DS by just people.

156
00:10:37,038 --> 00:10:40,273
Scott: you know I mean There's a. there's a comic reading software for the DS.

157
00:10:40,293 --> 00:10:41,620
Scott: You could read comics on that thing.

158
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,780
Scott: They're mp3 players all sorts of stuff.

159
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:51,787
Rym: I gotta say the only reason I didn't get into it was that I never heard someone who had one have anything Particularly glowing to say about the one they had.

160
00:10:51,807 --> 00:10:57,080
Scott: I mean there were some people who would flash the DS itself to replace the firm.

161
00:10:57,362 --> 00:10:58,250
Rym: I'm gonna happen.

162
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:07,478
Scott: if there was a guy I saw a video of him doing it and if I had that guy do it for me I would have said okay, but I'm not gonna try that myself see.

163
00:11:07,518 --> 00:11:16,460
Rym: the last time I did anything like that was when I modded my ps1 with a six-pin mod chip Mmm, and I I can't solder anymore.

164
00:11:16,621 --> 00:11:18,569
Rym: I used to solder stuff all the time as a kid.

165
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:21,100
Rym: I you know circuits and stuff and I was playing around with electronics.

166
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,726
Rym: I was in science Olympiad.

167
00:11:23,328 --> 00:11:25,274
Rym: I can't solder anymore soldering that mod chip.

168
00:11:25,315 --> 00:11:26,880
Rym: I burned myself like nine times.

169
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,808
Scott: Yeah, I've also lost that skill mostly.

170
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:30,415
Scott: I gotta get it back.

171
00:11:30,515 --> 00:11:31,640
Rym: It's not that useful anymore.

172
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,029
Rym: It's easier just to buy a new.

173
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:34,759
Rym: whatever thing broke that you're trying to fix.

174
00:11:35,402 --> 00:11:36,967
Scott: Yeah, but what if you're trying to make something new?

175
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:42,560
Rym: I buy an IC or mod something anyway You get a mod chip the sticks on the outside.

176
00:11:42,728 --> 00:11:49,967
Scott: Yeah There are flash me's and past me's and all this dreck that you had to deal with and it was all Expensive and confusing and nothing was perfect.

177
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:50,950
Scott: now.

178
00:11:51,030 --> 00:12:01,336
Scott: There is a new thing called the DS - X dream and This is as pretty much as close as we're gonna get to perfection now.

179
00:12:01,456 --> 00:12:02,440
Scott: It's a bit expensive.

180
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,459
Scott: It's like over a hundred bucks for this thing.

181
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:05,784
Scott: But what it is?

182
00:12:05,804 --> 00:12:37,540
Scott: it's a DS cartridge that has a little tiny USB connector at the top so you can plug it into your computer and inside of this flash cartridge DS cartridge is 512 megabytes or 4 gigabits of flash memory and In that flash memory you can put DS roms mp3s And it's got a cool little you know menu system.

183
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,603
Scott: so you could.

184
00:12:38,643 --> 00:12:42,655
Scott: you know a big DS ROM usually is only about 30 megabytes.

185
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:52,240
Scott: so you can put a whole lot of DS roms inside this one DS cartridge and Put it in your DS and then choose in the menu which DS game you want to play.

186
00:12:52,802 --> 00:12:56,580
Scott: The best thing is that this fully supports, you know one cartridge play.

187
00:12:57,042 --> 00:13:00,599
Scott: So if you have a ROM of say Mario Kart you can play it with.

188
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:03,231
Scott: you know All your friends even if they don't have Mario Kart.

189
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:11,757
Scott: and pretty much these guys Tested a whole bunch of different games and the only game that didn't work right was Pokemon diamond from Japan.

190
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:28,022
Rym: Oh well Yeah, I got to say if I actually jump on this boat and get some sort of play roms on my DS Nintendo and a lot of other companies are going to lose a lot of money because I bought bionic commando for $20.

191
00:13:28,022 --> 00:13:38,540
Rym: If I could just play my ROM collection on my DS that is my roms Minus the roms that suck times $20 that they're losing and I'll say right now that I'll pirate them and I'll do that.

192
00:13:38,641 --> 00:13:39,880
Rym: And that's the end of that question.

193
00:13:40,021 --> 00:13:44,280
Scott: Yeah, the way I figured out if you want to play NES SNES.

194
00:13:44,340 --> 00:14:06,179
Scott: Well, not SNES doesn't work so well but NES, you know GBA type roms you have to do is get one of these programs for your computer and You take that program and you take say an NES ROM and you feed it into the program and the program will spit out a Nintendo DS ROM of the NES game and you load that onto the cartridge to get it to play.

195
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:08,170
Scott: and That's how these things kind of work.

196
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:12,149
Scott: but DS doom Supposedly works even though one guy couldn't get it to work.

197
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,895
Scott: Everyone else could scum.

198
00:14:14,016 --> 00:14:17,719
Scott: VM DS works So you can play monkey island on your DS of this thing.

199
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,720
Scott: Oh Yeah, this is this is a hot thing.

200
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:29,420
Rym: you see This wouldn't be an issue if these companies would all have to embrace the DS and brought out all these games that now we're pirating.

201
00:14:30,301 --> 00:14:36,080
Scott: I know why the problem is is that you know, the DS can play GBA and DS games.

202
00:14:36,321 --> 00:14:41,360
Scott: So I'm if I get one of these I'm not gonna be using it to play GBA and DS games.

203
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:42,146
Scott: Oh my DS.

204
00:14:42,347 --> 00:14:44,140
Scott: if I want to do that, I'll just buy the game.

205
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:44,422
Scott: It's.

206
00:14:44,442 --> 00:14:49,508
Scott: you know, I don't need to pirate that even though some you know I could understand 13 year old kids with no money doing that.

207
00:14:49,548 --> 00:14:51,093
Scott: I'll excuse them me.

208
00:14:51,234 --> 00:14:51,876
Scott: What do I care?

209
00:14:51,876 --> 00:14:52,057
Scott: $30 DS game?

210
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,570
Scott: It's not like there's so many DS games.

211
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,381
Scott: I already have every DS game I want.

212
00:14:56,421 --> 00:15:05,208
Rym: wouldn't need to pirate one for but like imagine if Sierra had just taken all the police quest space quest quest for glory games And put him out on the DS.

213
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:06,373
Scott: I would have bought them all.

214
00:15:06,695 --> 00:15:07,800
Scott: but no they're not doing that.

215
00:15:08,483 --> 00:15:24,729
Scott: And you know while I can get a lot of these games on my computer, you know I'm using Linux and we got a Mac downstairs and you know While I can emulate the games there or perhaps get the original versions there or get an actual like old NES out and play the old games.

216
00:15:25,031 --> 00:15:27,100
Scott: It's so much effort and it's not portable.

217
00:15:28,182 --> 00:15:30,772
Scott: If I got an NES game, I want to play it portably, you know.

218
00:15:31,113 --> 00:15:32,720
Scott: and Rym look he's willing to pay for it.

219
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,899
Scott: He just bought bionic commando for the GBA.

220
00:15:35,128 --> 00:15:42,539
Rym: Yeah but Strider counts as negative money as far as I'm concerned and mighty final fight is a pretty much useless game.

221
00:15:43,604 --> 00:15:44,749
Scott: It's worth it to play one time.

222
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,919
Rym: Oh, yeah one time I've ever I already played it.

223
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:54,020
Rym: Yep before I bought this game I played it again to remind myself that the game involves drop kick drop kick drop kick drop kick drop kick drop kick.

224
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,622
Rym: That's how you win.

225
00:15:54,964 --> 00:15:55,646
Rym: Yep right now.

226
00:15:55,727 --> 00:15:56,710
Rym: I just spoiled the game.

227
00:15:56,991 --> 00:15:59,019
Rym: if you drop kick everyone you can't lose.

228
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:09,130
Scott: but anyway, the point is is that this is awesome new cart that you can buy and You put it in your DS and you can.

229
00:16:09,572 --> 00:16:16,178
Scott: your DS basically becomes this Programmable portable computer that can do all sorts of awesome things that it's not meant to do.

230
00:16:16,499 --> 00:16:18,447
Rym: isn't James or someone gonna get this?

231
00:16:18,848 --> 00:16:20,615
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna convince someone to get it.

232
00:16:20,836 --> 00:16:22,806
Scott: now that I figured out You know how it works.

233
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:25,080
Rym: We've often used James as our testbed for things.

234
00:16:25,207 --> 00:16:31,927
Scott: Yeah I'm using him as the testbed for this department because he's a lot more interested in it than I am because he wants to program Some DS software.

235
00:16:32,048 --> 00:16:32,732
Rym: we do too.

236
00:16:32,812 --> 00:16:34,683
Rym: We just don't have time I know.

237
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:35,205
Scott: I know.

238
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:37,777
Rym: remember when we tried to get a DS dev kit Nintendo laughed at us.

239
00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:39,808
Scott: Yeah Well now who's laughing?

240
00:16:39,848 --> 00:16:43,946
Scott: now, I'm gonna get one for a hundred bucks and change You know Def Con.

241
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:46,374
Rym: Yeah Def Con on the DS.

242
00:16:47,076 --> 00:16:47,597
Scott: Oh shit.

243
00:16:47,818 --> 00:16:51,608
Rym: That would be Wow, I wonder if he thought of that.

244
00:16:51,628 --> 00:16:52,732
Scott: I don't know.

245
00:16:53,174 --> 00:16:56,788
Rym: I'm gonna email him and just say hey Did you consider putting Def Con on the DS?

246
00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:00,000
Rym: Yeah, and I'll just fill the rest of the email with dollar signs.

247
00:17:03,344 --> 00:17:14,415
Rym: All right speaking of dollar signs brand theft auto for You know, there's it's gonna have all these high-res polygons You know, I just got to say something real quick about Grand Theft Auto.

248
00:17:14,457 --> 00:17:19,520
Scott: a great I played Grand Theft Auto 1 and in its day on the PC on DOS.

249
00:17:20,002 --> 00:17:33,095
Scott: That was a fun game and then I played the expansions for Grand Theft Auto London Which is the same game only it was a little bit more fun because they said funny British things and the cars are cool And London was a lot more fun to drive around.

250
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:33,700
Rym: Why is that?

251
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,329
Rym: Why is it that British accents make things cooler at us in the

252
00:17:36,409 --> 00:17:36,791
Rym: u.s.?

253
00:17:37,172 --> 00:17:39,279
Scott: I don't know but the Austin Powers car was wicked cool.

254
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,518
Scott: anyway.

255
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:46,680
Scott: GTA 2 came out and it was basically the same game only they changed it.

256
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:51,220
Scott: It was darker and it was like it was just it wasn't good.

257
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,980
Scott: They had like these gang wars and crap and they added all this extra crap to the game.

258
00:17:55,060 --> 00:18:02,300
Scott: It was no longer simply run around, you know for fun driving and running over people, you know, it got kind of bleh.

259
00:18:03,221 --> 00:18:07,283
Scott: GTA 3 I played it once and I was like, oh well, this isn't the game It used to be.

260
00:18:07,303 --> 00:18:10,420
Scott: screw this shit, but yet somehow it's the most popular game.

261
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,563
Rym: See, I enjoyed it because it was.

262
00:18:11,704 --> 00:18:14,692
Rym: it was the first widely known sandbox kind of.

263
00:18:15,013 --> 00:18:17,480
Rym: here's the world interact with it game.

264
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,105
Scott: But GTA 1 was like that.

265
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:29,599
Scott: GTA 3 was like a worse game, but they made it 3d without, you know It's like the game itself was 3d But it was the same as the 2d game only not

266
00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:34,196
Rym: really Because the world was a lot more immersive being 3d and having better graphics and the way the game was.

267
00:18:34,256 --> 00:18:36,162
Rym: it was more immersive and you Could do more.

268
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:37,747
Scott: Hey, not much more.

269
00:18:37,847 --> 00:18:38,871
Rym: Yeah quite a bit more.

270
00:18:38,891 --> 00:18:40,034
Scott: you shot people.

271
00:18:40,074 --> 00:18:41,960
Scott: you beat people up your random over with cars.

272
00:18:42,262 --> 00:18:44,537
Rym: Yeah, it was a lot more fun to me in the 3d.

273
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,867
Rym: But then again, I played the 3d.

274
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,858
Rym: exactly how long I could have enjoyed that about two hours.

275
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:51,464
Scott: Yeah I actually beat.

276
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,011
Scott: you know GTA 1.

277
00:18:53,011 --> 00:18:53,253
Scott: Yeah.

278
00:18:53,514 --> 00:18:54,679
Rym: But anyway, that's not my point.

279
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:55,665
Rym: Yeah I don't care at all.

280
00:18:55,887 --> 00:18:59,748
Rym: People are allowed to enjoy grind theft auto Mm-hmm captain.

281
00:19:00,089 --> 00:19:02,840
Rym: any game that I don't like sucks ass and people who play it are stupid.

282
00:19:03,202 --> 00:19:04,047
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

283
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:06,200
Scott: If I don't like it, I'm gonna say it sucks.

284
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:06,663
Scott: That's how.

285
00:19:06,744 --> 00:19:08,980
Scott: that's what people say things suck when they don't like them.

286
00:19:09,227 --> 00:19:22,640
Rym: No, no Cuz you always go the step further and say and you're wasting your time and you're stupid and you are Except you I recall last week would come home from work and play Sonic the fucking Hedgehog like - Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was awesome.

287
00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:24,904
Scott: Okay, yeah.

288
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:25,927
Rym: anyway.

289
00:19:26,388 --> 00:19:31,382
Rym: now Grand Theft Auto 4 is gonna be coming out for the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.

290
00:19:31,382 --> 00:19:41,000
Rym: No kidding, but they had announced a while ago There's going to be exclusive content on the Xbox 360. if you get that version of the game you get extra.

291
00:19:42,665 --> 00:19:51,999
Rym: Now the news here is not a hundred percent verified yet, but they've got a source who they call source And I don't if whether it's true or not is not the issue.

292
00:19:52,882 --> 00:19:55,369
Rym: But this sort of thing has been happening a lot lately.

293
00:19:55,409 --> 00:20:07,383
Rym: The rumor is and I'll give it about a 75% chance being true Grand Theft Auto 4 is going to have alternate exclusive content for the PlayStation 3 release Uh-huh.

294
00:20:07,644 --> 00:20:18,939
Rym: So it's kind of like when Soul Calibur 3 or 2 2 was released on three system I'm just gonna say that and each one, you know one had link had someone else one had someone else.

295
00:20:19,545 --> 00:20:20,779
Rym: You can tell which one I cared about.

296
00:20:21,081 --> 00:20:26,120
Scott: Yeah, and much most people cared about because apparently the GameCube was the most popular Soul Calibur 2 platform.

297
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,210
Rym: Yeah to anyone who thought the GameCube didn't do well.

298
00:20:28,451 --> 00:20:34,918
Rym: I mean it outsold the Xbox worldwide and Soul Calibur 2 for the GameCube sold more than either for the other ones.

299
00:20:34,938 --> 00:20:35,280
Rym: I don't know.

300
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:42,365
Scott: I think the ps2 sold more possibly but I think that like at tournaments and stuff people always played the GameCube one.

301
00:20:42,566 --> 00:20:49,200
Rym: Well part of the thing remember it's kind of founding issues there I mean the GameCube one looked better because the PlayStation 2 was really kind of at the end of its life.

302
00:20:49,562 --> 00:20:52,940
Scott: Yeah, yeah, it's still at the end of its life, but games are still coming out for it.

303
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:54,853
Rym: Yeah, and I'll bet games will keep coming out for it.

304
00:20:55,074 --> 00:20:55,900
Scott: Yep for a while now.

305
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,940
Rym: What's bothered me now is that a lot lately people are saying?

306
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,834
Rym: Oh, this game is exclusive for three months and three months later.

307
00:21:02,855 --> 00:21:10,100
Rym: It comes out on another platform Yep, and I guess it seems like such a dishonest and crappy business practice.

308
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,319
Rym: But yet people fall for it.

309
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:17,900
Rym: There are people who buy a console because of an exclusive game even though the game will come out for another console later.

310
00:21:18,405 --> 00:21:22,608
Scott: Yeah, I mean that's the number one thing I use if I'm deciding on what console to buy.

311
00:21:22,628 --> 00:21:25,717
Scott: my number one decision factor is the exclusive games.

312
00:21:25,777 --> 00:21:36,973
Scott: because you know If there's a game that's gonna come out for the ps3 the Xbox 360 and the computer Well, and I really want the game then I'm gonna get the computer.

313
00:21:37,013 --> 00:21:37,996
Scott: Why should I buy a console?

314
00:21:38,016 --> 00:21:39,440
Scott: I have a computer, you know.

315
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,780
Scott: So it all comes down to okay.

316
00:21:42,622 --> 00:21:49,200
Scott: If I'm gonna buy a console it has to have a lot of games that I need that console in order to play.

317
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:57,920
Scott: you know that are games that I must play that I can't live without playing somehow and You know Nintendo always seems to have the exclusives.

318
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:02,000
Scott: You're not gonna see Zelda hunt anywhere else and you know, you're not gonna see it anywhere else.

319
00:22:08,751 --> 00:22:10,367
Rym: things of the day.

320
00:22:10,387 --> 00:22:14,021
Scott: I Had another thing of the day planned, but it got.

321
00:22:14,282 --> 00:22:19,830
Scott: I'm gonna push it back to tomorrow because My brother informed me I had a more important thing of the day to use.

322
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:25,592
Rym: See the thing is I could totally preempt your thing of the day now because I'm the one who found it and showed it to You.

323
00:22:25,612 --> 00:22:27,810
Rym: I build it up for a whole day.

324
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:31,084
Rym: I was like I got this awesome thing and when you see it, you're gonna go.

325
00:22:31,706 --> 00:22:32,530
Scott: it's my thing of the day.

326
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:33,375
Scott: I got dibs.

327
00:22:33,455 --> 00:22:35,990
Scott: I called dibs and I'm gonna do it tomorrow.

328
00:22:36,413 --> 00:22:36,856
Rym: But if what?

329
00:22:36,896 --> 00:22:38,810
Rym: if I do it today, you could still do it tomorrow.

330
00:22:40,464 --> 00:22:41,373
Rym: No Why not?

331
00:22:41,755 --> 00:22:42,981
Scott: because it's already been done.

332
00:22:43,001 --> 00:22:45,090
Scott: We never duplicate things of the day unless we forget.

333
00:22:45,391 --> 00:22:49,030
Rym: Well, if I do it today, then it would be your choice to duplicate it tomorrow.

334
00:22:49,931 --> 00:22:50,795
Scott: I already got dibs.

335
00:22:50,896 --> 00:22:53,286
Scott: if you violate dibs, there will be consequences.

336
00:22:53,587 --> 00:23:03,085
Rym: All right, fine I'll just say that Scott's thing of the day involves Batman Hey and Super Mario Brothers - stop giving away my things of the day.

337
00:23:03,105 --> 00:23:03,186
Scott: Yeah.

338
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:06,400
Rym: Yeah All right, you can give my things of the day away.

339
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,848
Scott: I forget everything that it is.

340
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:08,230
Scott: Really?

341
00:23:08,591 --> 00:23:09,234
Scott: Yeah, what is it?

342
00:23:09,575 --> 00:23:13,310
Rym: All right, so there's this game a little flash game that came.

343
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,520
Rym: Oh, yeah I can't remember now and Scott pointed me to it after.

344
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,075
Rym: well first he starts playing in his room and I hear him because whatever He wants attention.

345
00:23:20,738 --> 00:23:22,728
Rym: He'll talk really loudly in his room hoping I'll walk in.

346
00:23:23,796 --> 00:23:32,153
Rym: So I hear oh a game huh, oh Fuck fuck Fuck this game.

347
00:23:32,414 --> 00:23:37,794
Rym: and he runs into my room and says you got to try this game and and you tried that game this game It's just.

348
00:23:37,895 --> 00:23:40,210
Rym: you know those games where you got a little cursor and you get contribute.

349
00:23:40,331 --> 00:23:42,730
Rym: Basically, you have a block that follows your mouse cursor.

350
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:47,247
Rym: You have to move it around an obstacle course without touching anything and get it to a goal.

351
00:23:47,548 --> 00:23:48,010
Rym: No big deal.

352
00:23:49,651 --> 00:23:51,055
Rym: This one reverses your mouse.

353
00:23:51,176 --> 00:23:52,299
Rym: up is down left is right.

354
00:23:53,162 --> 00:23:54,606
Scott: It really sucks in.

355
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:55,750
Scott: it really sucks.

356
00:23:56,031 --> 00:24:02,130
Rym: Now I got to level 19 and I stopped only because it was late and we had to do the show.

357
00:24:02,792 --> 00:24:04,759
Scott: It was indeed level 19.

358
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:05,301
Scott: I saw it.

359
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:09,012
Rym: we're not lying now this game Will.

360
00:24:09,374 --> 00:24:12,130
Rym: it's painful to watch someone else play it.

361
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:20,069
Rym: It's painful to be more painful to play it because when you lose it makes this noise And you just and it's like shock therapy.

362
00:24:21,272 --> 00:24:25,166
Scott: It really is just so irritating to even be near this game.

363
00:24:25,186 --> 00:24:28,410
Rym: now something interesting Is that after I played the first two levels?

364
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:33,070
Rym: I got really really really good at it And now I can just sit down and get back to level 19 in about five minutes.

365
00:24:33,191 --> 00:24:36,163
Scott: Oh, yeah, it's really a matter of patience it beating the game.

366
00:24:36,424 --> 00:24:37,710
Rym: No, it's a matter of muscle memory.

367
00:24:38,032 --> 00:24:42,597
Rym: If you play it for like an a half hour or so You can just use a backwards mouse.

368
00:24:42,637 --> 00:24:42,898
Rym: fine.

369
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:43,059
Rym: Now.

370
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,249
Rym: I can just use a backwards mouse without even thinking about it.

371
00:24:45,853 --> 00:24:47,669
Scott: Yeah, yeah, but I mean anyone can do that.

372
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:49,217
Scott: So it's just patience.

373
00:24:49,277 --> 00:24:51,246
Scott: and are you gonna sit there and build that skill?

374
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:54,860
Scott: and once you do It's just how long are you gonna spend playing before you win?

375
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,325
Rym: I think the skill is permanent.

376
00:24:57,108 --> 00:24:57,569
Scott: I don't know.

377
00:24:58,014 --> 00:24:59,030
Rym: I'm gonna a week from now.

378
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:04,112
Rym: I'm gonna try to play the game cuz just now I played the game and I literally went level one two three four five six Seven eight.

379
00:25:04,132 --> 00:25:06,824
Rym: without even trying I could just move the mouse around backwards.

380
00:25:06,844 --> 00:25:07,467
Rym: Uh-huh.

381
00:25:08,553 --> 00:25:14,605
Rym: However, I'm not to get to that point I had to play the game for over a half hour yesterday and got fucking damn.

382
00:25:14,706 --> 00:25:15,409
Scott: Was that worth it?

383
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:16,754
Rym: Yeah, I think it was.

384
00:25:16,774 --> 00:25:18,260
Rym: All right, and you know what?

385
00:25:18,621 --> 00:25:22,932
Rym: It's more worth it than learning to type into for ack Haha.

386
00:25:23,234 --> 00:25:23,555
Rym: All right.

387
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,222
Rym: So what was your thing of the day?

Scott: All right, so today Is a special day.

00:25:28,615 --> 00:25:30,583
Scott: It is Tuesday the 17th.

390
00:25:30,603 --> 00:25:39,746
Scott: Oh shit You may not realize this but Tuesday the 17th only occurs alongside a Friday the 13th.

391
00:25:40,951 --> 00:25:43,885
Rym: It is in fact the unluckiest day of the year.

392
00:25:45,151 --> 00:25:47,440
Scott: It is indeed the unluckiest day of the year now.

393
00:25:47,801 --> 00:25:48,122
Rym: Luckily.

394
00:25:48,163 --> 00:25:49,568
Rym: We had some beef carcasses today.

395
00:25:49,588 --> 00:25:50,130
Rym: So we're okay.

396
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:52,196
Scott: We're okay with our beef carcasses.

397
00:25:52,538 --> 00:25:53,661
Scott: now my brother.

398
00:25:53,681 --> 00:25:56,430
Scott: I am me and he was like bad juju.

399
00:25:57,991 --> 00:26:07,321
Scott: That's all he said and I immediately knew what he was talking about and sent him a YouTube link To my thing of the day, which is an episode of Ren and Stimpy.

400
00:26:07,341 --> 00:26:10,190
Scott: That is very old that we both remember called.

401
00:26:11,013 --> 00:26:11,555
Scott: What's it called?

00:26:11,595 --> 00:26:15,790
Scott: like Stimpy or superstitious Stimpy is the name of the episode?

403
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,377

Rym: no anyway picture catch you catch you pitch you pitch you get you get you get snow.

408
00:26:42,671 --> 00:26:45,090
Scott: Good red red is really unlucky.

409
00:26:45,131 --> 00:26:47,356
Scott: in fact he's the unlucky beast like.

410
00:26:47,437 --> 00:26:53,890
Scott: he was born on Tuesday the 17th and he has webbed toes and They basically really make fun of superstitions.

411
00:26:54,311 --> 00:27:01,658
Scott: but they they're also true in the episode where people get hit with lightning because they do something unlucky and It's pretty hilarious.

412
00:27:02,443 --> 00:27:03,488
Scott: and today's Tuesday the 17th.

413
00:27:04,771 --> 00:27:08,287
Scott: My brother used to think he was born on Tuesday the 17th because he was born on a 17th.

414
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:12,222
Scott: But I just checked and he was born on Monday the 17th.

415
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:13,186
Rym: Whoa lucky.

416
00:27:13,448 --> 00:27:18,785
Rym: Yeah Well, if he hadn't been lucky he would have been born on this Tuesday the 17th exactly.

417
00:27:19,448 --> 00:27:22,256
Scott: just to clarify Superstitions are all bullshit.

418
00:27:22,296 --> 00:27:25,706
Rym: Yeah, except apparently throwing salt over your shoulders.

419
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:29,108
Scott: It's not a superstition It's a. it's a ritual just like pen says.

420
00:27:32,453 --> 00:27:41,950
Rym: I won't bring it up in too detail now because I don't want to go long in the episode But I recall you getting quite perturbed at one point when we prevented you from throwing the salt over your shoulder.

421
00:27:42,071 --> 00:27:44,068
Scott: You got rituals you do like what?

422
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:45,694
Rym: Stuff like what?

423
00:27:46,016 --> 00:27:46,518
Rym: I'm curious.

424
00:27:47,141 --> 00:27:48,970
Rym: I'm not denying it, but I'd like to hear some evidence.

425
00:27:50,713 --> 00:27:52,590
Scott: What are some of rims ritual?

426
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:56,594
Rym: Ha Scott can't come up with anything Besides.

427
00:27:56,976 --> 00:28:05,456
Rym: Scott is the one who was so anti Religion spirituality philosophy anything and getting through salt over his shoulder to keep the demons away It's not to keep the demons away.

428
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:08,909
Scott: There's nothing wrong with doing things as long as you don't, you know.

429
00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:16,490
Rym: Well, I'll note that the reason you gave us for many years that you did it was quote because otherwise something bad will happen.

430
00:28:16,812 --> 00:28:17,818
Scott: No, I didn't say that.

431
00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:19,409
Scott: Yes, you did said something will happen.

432
00:28:21,802 --> 00:28:23,133
Scott: Okay Something will happen.

433
00:28:23,194 --> 00:28:24,177
Scott: something always happens.

434
00:28:24,217 --> 00:28:26,232
Scott: something's happening right now Who knows.

435
00:28:26,252 --> 00:28:29,589
Rym: so it's okay to make a pedantic kind of BS argument like that.

436
00:28:30,412 --> 00:28:35,305
Scott: It's okay to have a meaningless ritual if it's not harmful.

437
00:28:35,365 --> 00:28:37,010
Rym: World of Warcraft is a meaningless ritual.

438
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:37,632
Scott: Oh, it's not.

439
00:28:37,692 --> 00:28:38,855
Scott: that takes way too much time.

440
00:28:38,995 --> 00:28:42,966
Scott: Why if all right, if you're ritual because you're wasting salts?

441
00:28:43,447 --> 00:28:44,530
Scott: salt is wasting salt.

442
00:28:45,112 --> 00:28:46,175
Rym: You're also making a mess.

443
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:47,639
Scott: that's not harmful either.

444
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,949
Scott: the salt you make things clean right whatever?

445
00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:58,477
Rym: today We're going to talk about Japanese versus puzzle games because over the weekend We didn't bring any board games to the northern geek house.

446
00:28:58,979 --> 00:29:05,018
Rym: We pretty much just played video games hung out and drank a little Yep, and we watched one movie, but I slept.

447
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,424
Rym: Yeah, it wasn't that good a movie.

448
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:07,307
Rym: I was really disappointed.

449
00:29:07,729 --> 00:29:08,780
Scott: Oh good I'm glad I slept.

450
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:19,869
Rym: Yeah For reference the movie was all the Queen's Men, which would have been a useless movie But it had Eddie Izzard in it and it had some really good lines, but the movie was overall kind of met all right.

451
00:29:20,652 --> 00:29:25,914
Scott: Anyway for those of you don't realize you know we play Tetris in this country And I think we play.

452
00:29:25,934 --> 00:29:26,415
Scott: what are the games?

453
00:29:26,435 --> 00:29:26,897
Scott: they play?

454
00:29:26,937 --> 00:29:38,969
Scott: bejeweled and you know all those puzzle games were stuff falls from the top And you guide it to the bottom or stuff falls from the top and you kind of move stuff around to arrange it in a better fashion.

455
00:29:38,989 --> 00:29:48,050
Scott: and And Well in Japan there's a lot more of those that we never get to see or They get turned into something else before they come over to this country.

456
00:29:48,431 --> 00:29:58,381
Rym: Not only that just the whole genre of that a versus style puzzle game for things fall from the sky and time as a factor Is really more advanced over there?

457
00:29:58,642 --> 00:30:03,016
Scott: Yeah, if you try to play like for example Cardcaptor Sakura Tetris.

458
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:06,189
Scott: right you play this thing on the PlayStation in Japan.

459
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:09,581
Scott: now It's Tetris only it has Cardcaptor Sakura on it.

460
00:30:09,721 --> 00:30:10,022
Scott: Okay.

461
00:30:10,123 --> 00:30:11,929
Scott: It has a nice theme very nice.

462
00:30:12,572 --> 00:30:31,850
Scott: however, if you play versus mode you actually choose a character and Depending on which character you choose when you do damage to the opponent your character will do damage in a different pattern Based on the character you choose and some characters are actually better than others and drop more dangerous patterns on the enemy.

463
00:30:32,433 --> 00:30:35,910
Scott: You know you ever play some good examples or in the u.s.

464
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:40,489
Scott: Would be super puzzle fighter where your street fighter guy does attacks to the other side.

465
00:30:41,334 --> 00:30:43,649
Scott: Only imagine the character mattering a lot more.

466
00:30:44,731 --> 00:30:46,195
Scott: Japan has a lot of games like this.

467
00:30:46,395 --> 00:30:51,370
Rym: yeah, basically I would say that these games aren't so much puzzle games as they are fighting games.

468
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:53,219
Rym: They're just abstract fighting games.

469
00:30:53,521 --> 00:30:55,270
Scott: Yeah, I guess you could look at it that way.

470
00:30:55,432 --> 00:30:56,589
Scott: You know it's a fighting game.

471
00:30:56,951 --> 00:31:00,970
Scott: We know cuz reflexes and control of the gamepad matter just as much.

472
00:31:01,732 --> 00:31:05,563
Scott: Only it's more about quick thinking and it's sort of like you know.

473
00:31:05,623 --> 00:31:09,938
Scott: you solve your puzzle in a way That you know causes an attack.

474
00:31:09,998 --> 00:31:27,182
Scott: so instead of just pushing a button to make an attack happen You sort of build an attack on in your board and then unleash it at the critical moment while your opponent might unleash attacks on you which you know mess up your board and Defeat your ability to release attacks.

475
00:31:27,282 --> 00:31:32,108
Rym: now normally we talk about how awesome We are at things, but we're not the old-school masters of these games.

476
00:31:32,148 --> 00:31:44,020
Rym: in fact I had never seen these games until I got to RIT and at the RIT Anime Club social nights I saw a lot of people older than me playing these games Very quickly and very well.

477
00:31:44,261 --> 00:31:46,290
Scott: Yeah, we suck relatively speaking.

478
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:51,649
Scott: I mean I could probably beat most of the listeners until oh wait a way to throw down my.

479
00:31:52,232 --> 00:31:54,821
Scott: Okay, I mean the listeners who?

480
00:31:55,021 --> 00:31:56,105
Scott: because who else is there this?

481
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:57,510
Scott: meet you me and the listeners, right?

482
00:31:58,073 --> 00:32:05,563
Scott: So I could buy beat most listeners who never played the game before But I imagine a lot of them would advance their skill rapidly and thwart us.

483
00:32:05,683 --> 00:32:07,047
Rym: see like we'll be.

484
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:09,917
Rym: watch our friend Adam And our friends go Joe play the game right.

485
00:32:10,058 --> 00:32:12,547
Scott: they would kick our ass every time watching them play each other.

486
00:32:12,588 --> 00:32:14,556
Rym: the game looks really Easy, and they're just throwing stuff around.

487
00:32:14,596 --> 00:32:16,003
Rym: throwing stuff around throwing stuff around.

488
00:32:16,043 --> 00:32:17,550
Rym: then five minutes later someone dies.

489
00:32:18,193 --> 00:32:21,069
Rym: So then I sit down next to him like Adam, and I play.

490
00:32:21,089 --> 00:32:25,271
Rym: I Died within 11 seconds, yeah I'm like.

491
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:30,590
Scott: I'm thinking this game is completely unfair because I have no chance to do anything at all.

492
00:32:30,811 --> 00:32:31,152
Scott: I'm like.

493
00:32:31,413 --> 00:32:32,518
Scott: this is just bullshit.

494
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:33,462
Scott: screw this game.

495
00:32:33,542 --> 00:32:34,265
Scott: It's not worth it.

496
00:32:34,848 --> 00:32:37,340
Rym: so one of the games We play this weekend was magical drop.

497
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:39,330
Scott: magical drop is a classic.

498
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:44,856
Scott: I think they're actually newer ones like magical drop F or magical drop J Or s. I don't know the letters.

499
00:32:45,137 --> 00:32:46,041
Rym: the games are that.

500
00:32:46,161 --> 00:32:47,406
Rym: the gameplay is very simple.

501
00:32:47,767 --> 00:32:48,169
Rym: you can.

502
00:32:48,912 --> 00:32:54,809
Rym: Gems of different color are coming down in pad in square patterns from the sky, and they're basically it's like Tetris upside down.

503
00:32:55,070 --> 00:33:01,701
Scott: Yep, like this is bored growing on top of you, and you can think of it like Stalag tights coming down from the ceiling.

504
00:33:02,084 --> 00:33:06,495
Rym: yeah because remember Stalagmites might hang from the ceiling But they don't right.

505
00:33:06,535 --> 00:33:10,350
Scott: and you're this little jester and the jester is at the bottom of the screen.

506
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:11,538
Rym: see I don't think you're the jester.

507
00:33:11,578 --> 00:33:19,250
Rym: I think you are the Ranging between cute and slightly edgy girl standing in the background of the jester is your minion?

508
00:33:20,311 --> 00:33:26,130
Scott: Okay, you could put it that way, but anyway you control the jester and the jester can do two things.

509
00:33:26,572 --> 00:33:38,030
Scott: He can pull balls from the top of the screen into notes Yeah into his hands skirt And he can take all the balls in his hands skirts and toss them up to the top of the screen.

510
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,384
Scott: Those are the two things he can do.

511
00:33:39,929 --> 00:33:49,343
Rym: now There's different colors, and the goal is to get what three four four in a row I think for a number in a row vertically of one color.

512
00:33:49,804 --> 00:33:57,629
Rym: if you cause that to happen then Every gemmy of that color touching those will disappear in addition to those mm-hmm.

513
00:33:58,331 --> 00:34:01,583
Scott: So let's say there's a horizontal row of blue balls.

514
00:34:02,004 --> 00:34:06,340
Scott: you you go to the far left You pick up you pull the blue ball down into your hand.

515
00:34:06,401 --> 00:34:08,909
Scott: you go right you pull down another blue ball.

516
00:34:09,273 --> 00:34:14,246
Scott: You go to the right you take the two blue balls You're holding and throw them to the top of the screen.

517
00:34:14,348 --> 00:34:17,686
Scott: now You've got three blue balls in one vertical column.

518
00:34:17,726 --> 00:34:22,925
Scott: they disappear But they're touching this horizontal row of blue balls that are still remaining.

519
00:34:23,025 --> 00:34:24,109
Scott: all those disappear as well.

520
00:34:24,391 --> 00:34:29,859
Rym: Yeah, because if blue balls are touching a horizontal row of blue balls That's the best way to get rid of blue balls of course.

521
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:33,406
Scott: now the problem is you can only hold one color ball at the same time.

522
00:34:35,311 --> 00:34:40,429
Scott: So if you're holding a blue ball you can't pull down a yellow ball or a green ball.

523
00:34:40,792 --> 00:34:43,833
Rym: So if you see you know you can say there's five blue balls You can grab.

524
00:34:43,853 --> 00:34:45,099
Rym: you go grab grab grab grab.

525
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,010
Rym: then you throw them all in one spot and make them all go away.

526
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:51,370
Scott: You got to toss up the blue balls before you can grab the green balls, and there's other things.

527
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,996
Rym: I mean depending on what character you are.

528
00:34:53,016 --> 00:35:03,575
Rym: because every time you make things go away or get combos it drops Bad things on the other person's screen the little slimes with eyeballs, and they will know that's battle That's a different game.

529
00:35:03,595 --> 00:35:03,857
Scott: All right.

530
00:35:03,877 --> 00:35:04,582
Rym: That's battle balls.

531
00:35:04,643 --> 00:35:08,290
Scott: I'm thinking wrong game Yeah, drops ice cubes and all sorts of other nasty.

532
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:11,681
Rym: It just drops other stuff on the other guy's screen does damage them.

533
00:35:11,721 --> 00:35:14,189
Rym: the pattern of the damage depends on what character you play.

534
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:17,801
Scott: for Example one character does a lot of damage in the middle.

535
00:35:18,223 --> 00:35:33,609
Scott: so if you want to defeat this character You're gonna have to have a strategy where you take balls from the middle and put them on the sides Or else the middle row is gonna get really long and come down and stab you right away When the sides are gonna be really shallow and not near killing you.

536
00:35:34,172 --> 00:35:37,746
Rym: I'll note that if you've never played these games before it doesn't matter.

537
00:35:37,806 --> 00:35:38,549
Rym: You'll just lose.

538
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:45,924
Rym: Basically yeah unless I mean when Scott and I played against each other was fine because we both really sucked and the game actually Was playable hmm?

539
00:35:46,591 --> 00:35:51,920
Scott: Well, I think what makes the games interesting in general is that if you play something like Tetris It's the same every time.

540
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,349
Scott: it's who's gonna play Tetris better.

541
00:35:53,912 --> 00:36:04,790
Scott: but these characters while they might unbalance the game at points and What they do is they force the the other the opponent to change up how they play the game in order to win.

542
00:36:05,652 --> 00:36:21,028
Scott: You know if I play the game in a certain way all the time and you use a different character it drastically changes the pattern of the pieces I have to play with and I'm forced to completely change my Strategy or lose unless you don't know what you're doing in which case it doesn't matter okay.

543
00:36:21,068 --> 00:36:23,650
Scott: the other game We played was battle balls.

544
00:36:24,656 --> 00:36:28,278
Rym: Right after we Generated and played with throats for about an hour.

545
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:34,790
Scott: right now my first playing a battle balls I was playing against someone is really good, and I couldn't do anything.

546
00:36:34,891 --> 00:36:44,289
Scott: So I thought the game was complete crap and useless And I was right about some of that and not so right about some of that You know, but it wasn't as impossible as I thought it was.

547
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:48,844
Scott: But it's still a little bit annoying and a little bit luck-based at points.

548
00:36:48,964 --> 00:36:53,480
Rym: my experience with the game was thus I have a little triangle of balls falling all right.

549
00:36:53,561 --> 00:36:54,545
Rym: I'll let him fall somewhere.

550
00:36:54,826 --> 00:36:56,554
Rym: Oh look they rolled out They spread out.

551
00:36:56,916 --> 00:36:57,620
Rym: Oh another set.

552
00:36:57,881 --> 00:36:58,062
Rym: who?

553
00:36:58,123 --> 00:36:59,329
Rym: I can get those colors to line up.

554
00:36:59,832 --> 00:37:01,842
Rym: Hey, it didn't fall where I wanted it to do.

555
00:37:02,164 --> 00:37:02,767
Rym: what the fuck.

556
00:37:02,807 --> 00:37:03,209
Rym: I'm dead.

557
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:07,237
Scott: Yeah, see the problem with this game Is that you have these balls.

558
00:37:07,498 --> 00:37:10,490
Scott: then they come down in sets of three and they're different colors.

559
00:37:11,092 --> 00:37:18,436
Scott: And if you can you know you put them down and if any of them are kind of not balanced properly They'll fall down.

560
00:37:18,496 --> 00:37:21,249
Scott: and you know roll around until they land somewhere.

561
00:37:21,269 --> 00:37:22,697
Scott: yep Yep, so think of it.

562
00:37:22,737 --> 00:37:26,135
Scott: like you know you're taking a bunch of pebbles in your hand And you just let go of them.

563
00:37:26,597 --> 00:37:29,328
Scott: you know some of them land on top of the pile and stay there.

564
00:37:29,389 --> 00:37:30,768
Scott: some of them roll down the sides.

565
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:49,578
Scott: Now if you match up enough balls of the right color touching each other they disappear And that causes the balls on top of them to fall down which in turn Hopefully will make another set of colored balls that will disappear and cause a chain reaction Eventually doing extreme damage to the opponent.

566
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:57,524
Rym: the goal of experienced players seems to be to Set up a giant combo build and build and build and build and build and build and build.

567
00:37:58,066 --> 00:38:01,115
Rym: and then it's kind of a Bringsmanship thing where both people are building.

568
00:38:02,018 --> 00:38:12,510
Rym: if you set off a combo and the other person sets off a combo while you're doing it To counter your combo They basically end up doing more damage to you than you do to them because they counter it and then they counter attack.

569
00:38:12,571 --> 00:38:16,290
Scott: Yeah, the timing has a lot to do with it Which is why you know we did say it's more.

570
00:38:16,493 --> 00:38:22,050
Scott: It's a lot like a fighting game And you know I mean normally the combo the other guy did would have just done a whole bunch of damage.

571
00:38:22,171 --> 00:38:26,109
Scott: You know if you play Tetris if I get a Tetris and Rym gets a Tetris it evens out.

572
00:38:26,591 --> 00:38:30,181
Scott: Imagine if the timing of when you set off the Tetris caused.

573
00:38:30,262 --> 00:38:34,234
Scott: you know the guy who does it at the right moment actually does More damage to the opponent.

574
00:38:34,836 --> 00:38:42,201
Scott: it adds this whole other level to the game instead of just putting the things in the right places But putting them in the right places at the right time.

575
00:38:42,241 --> 00:38:44,529
Scott: sometimes you want to go slow sometimes you want to go fast.

576
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,790
Rym: now This is the game that has that horrible damage thing.

577
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:57,496
Rym: Damage seems to come in the in the form of little slimies that fall into your board and any time They come across one of your balls They grab it and turn that color.

578
00:38:57,977 --> 00:39:02,090
Rym: now they count as walk that color and you can destroy them by destroying normal balls next to.

579
00:39:03,013 --> 00:39:04,437
Rym: But you can't destroy them on their own.

580
00:39:04,818 --> 00:39:09,907
Rym: and furthermore when you destroy them the slime goes away and the ball They originally were remains.

581
00:39:10,752 --> 00:39:16,650
Scott: Yeah, so you basically have two kinds of balls this the colored balls and there's colored balls with eyeballs.

582
00:39:17,312 --> 00:39:19,498
Scott: And if it has eyeballs that's not good.

583
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:23,049
Scott: and when you get damaged you bet your screen basically fills up with eyeballs.

584
00:39:23,189 --> 00:39:51,410
Scott: normally There's only a few eyeballs on your screen But when you get damaged there's a lot of eyeballs on your screen a whole lot of eyeballs And you can't get rid of an eyeball unless you match up some non eyeballs on top of them and Often playing against a good opponent They'll fill your screen with eyeballs to the point where you have no room on top of the eyeballs to make any matches whatsoever Unless you're really really lucky and the pieces that you get you know don't have any eyeballs in them.

585
00:39:51,952 --> 00:39:58,448
Scott: And then all the other opponent has to do is you know let's say I'm near the top of the screen but I can still make a match and clear the whole screen away.

586
00:39:58,469 --> 00:40:02,403
Scott: I Put down a piece then he drops a few more eyeballs on me.

587
00:40:02,644 --> 00:40:02,945
Scott: I'm done.

588
00:40:03,126 --> 00:40:05,193
Scott: There's no way I can win That's it.

589
00:40:05,675 --> 00:40:06,499
Scott: There's eyeballs there.

590
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:07,424
Scott: There's no way to get rid of them.

591
00:40:07,444 --> 00:40:08,449
Scott: There's no room game over.

592
00:40:08,469 --> 00:40:09,871
Scott: and That's.

593
00:40:09,891 --> 00:40:15,270
Scott: what kind of bothered me is that it felt like you know when you weren't dead you were dead anyway.

594
00:40:15,832 --> 00:40:21,750
Scott: And I really don't think a game should have that situation where you know if I have lost it should be game over.

595
00:40:22,071 --> 00:40:25,410
Scott: You know it's kind of annoying when it's game over, but it's not game over yet.

596
00:40:25,611 --> 00:40:36,170
Scott: I disagree in this game because one that situation lasts about five seconds It does But it's still annoying and I go through this five seconds of time where I'm trying to save myself.

597
00:40:36,713 --> 00:40:37,397
Rym: That's theirs.

598
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:45,510
Rym: because if you were actually good that Usually you're not as hurt and that gives you the chance to if you had a combo set up to get to it.

599
00:40:45,811 --> 00:40:48,801
Scott: Sometimes there is a small there was a small chance.

600
00:40:48,942 --> 00:40:51,250
Scott: You know and people did escape from that horrible situation.

601
00:40:52,151 --> 00:40:57,970
Scott: However it mostly depended on what balls they were given which is random and not a matter of skill.

602
00:40:59,015 --> 00:41:02,150
Rym: The situation that most lasts a few seconds is not a big deal in this game.

603
00:41:02,297 --> 00:41:02,490
Rym: Yeah

604
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:18,908
Scott: the other thing that bothered me is like you know I would set up a big combo and I would just need one particular colored Ball to set it off, and I wouldn't get that colored ball for like you know too many pieces in which case It didn't matter anymore need a completely different color And I never get exactly what I need.

605
00:41:18,928 --> 00:41:27,219
Scott: and It's just kind of annoying because you know all the timing in the world and all the nice setup in the world won't help You if the game doesn't give you the color that you want.

606
00:41:27,741 --> 00:41:32,238
Rym: it also has the interesting mechanic that the game is pretty much Symmetrical both people get the same pieces.

607
00:41:32,299 --> 00:41:39,490
Rym: imagine playing Tetris where everyone gets a square Then everyone gets a line then everyone gets another square.

608
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:42,772
Scott: Yeah, it's kind of tricky though I mean it doesn't.

609
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:52,790
Scott: you know as people really start playing you know one guy either drops away more pieces than the other guy and Then one guy gets attacked And it doesn't really you know matter so much anymore.

610
00:41:53,393 --> 00:41:56,749
Scott: And you know who knows where in the sequence of balls each guy is.

611
00:41:56,769 --> 00:42:01,229
Rym: well Yeah, but you get the same starting sequence, so you start on a perfectly level playing field.

612
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:04,710
Scott: Well, you know it's it seems perfectly level.

613
00:42:04,971 --> 00:42:08,470
Scott: But then you know a couple eyeballs will fall down and that mixes up the whole thing.

614
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:09,535
Rym: But that's after the start.

615
00:42:09,575 --> 00:42:11,985
Rym: I said you start with a perfectly even playing field.

616
00:42:12,126 --> 00:42:12,809
Scott: yeah, I guess.

617
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:14,457
Scott: so It just doesn't really.

618
00:42:14,517 --> 00:42:15,683
Scott: it's not really equal.

619
00:42:15,703 --> 00:42:20,870
Rym: It is kind You're just gonna blame because you suck at the game, and I also suck at the game.

620
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:22,658
Rym: But I accept that fact and move on.

621
00:42:22,759 --> 00:42:25,050
Scott: yeah, well I accept the fact that I suck at the game.

622
00:42:25,432 --> 00:42:26,316
Scott: I'm just pointing out.

623
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,890
Scott: You know these slight imperfections in its puzzling.

624
00:42:29,511 --> 00:42:32,369
Rym: Yeah, I mean there are a lot more games like this like put your pop and whatever.

625
00:42:33,171 --> 00:42:33,974
Scott: Yeah, put your pop.

626
00:42:33,994 --> 00:42:37,129
Scott: That's the one where you just drop the little eyeball guys and match the colors.

627
00:42:37,149 --> 00:42:37,872
Rym: now You shoot them up.

628
00:42:39,336 --> 00:42:40,940
Scott: I think I don't remember.

629
00:42:41,201 --> 00:42:42,585
Rym: There's a million of these games.

630
00:42:42,926 --> 00:42:50,848
Scott: Yeah one other one I just want to talk about real quick is panel day pawn Which you might not know as Pokemon Puzzle League for the n64.

631
00:42:51,912 --> 00:42:55,829
Scott: They changed it to Pokemon when they brought it over here because they figured otherwise no one would want it.

632
00:42:56,834 --> 00:42:59,409
Scott: But it's actually this really kind of good puzzle game.

633
00:42:59,449 --> 00:42:59,630
Scott: where?

634
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:06,130
Scott: You you know there's a bunch of squares of different colors And you kind of flip them and you try to match them up.

635
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:08,420
Scott: You know to be the same color like you know.

636
00:43:08,581 --> 00:43:10,590
Scott: oh, there's a red and a blue next to each other.

637
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:13,018
Scott: Let me you know make them switch places now.

638
00:43:13,058 --> 00:43:16,849
Scott: There's three Reds in a row, and they disappear and it came out.

639
00:43:17,753 --> 00:43:19,219
Scott: Oh, no, or did it not come out.

640
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,063
Scott: I can't remember they.

641
00:43:20,645 --> 00:43:23,035
Rym: oh if I had a thought bird It would play right now.

642
00:43:23,135 --> 00:43:26,509
Scott: They made a GBA compilation of puzzle games, and they put dr.

643
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:30,664
Scott: Mario, and it was either panel day pawn or something else on there.

644
00:43:30,965 --> 00:43:34,945
Scott: It was original Yoshi's cookie And I know she's cookie is a bad game.

645
00:43:34,985 --> 00:43:35,830
Scott: I like Yoshi's cookie.

646
00:43:36,151 --> 00:43:41,429
Scott: I think they took out panel day pawn which they were gonna put on there originally which kind of sucks because I like it.

647
00:43:42,455 --> 00:43:44,130
Scott: But yeah, that's it's another similar game.

648
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:48,670
Scott: You know you choose a character and that changes the kind of stuff that happens to the other guy.

649
00:43:49,531 --> 00:43:54,570
Rym: Yeah, if you see these games around they're the best places to find them are usually at anime conventions.

650
00:43:55,711 --> 00:43:59,103
Scott: Another good place is just anywhere you can get PlayStation roms.

651
00:43:59,123 --> 00:44:01,230
Scott: I mean we're talking about PlayStation roms anyway.

652
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:05,050
Scott: They're all Japanese games, but the menus are pretty simple.

653
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:07,159
Scott: I mean you go to one player.

654
00:44:07,179 --> 00:44:09,610
Rym: not only do you not need to know Japanese to play the game?

655
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:16,330
Rym: But even if you have trouble there are a million facts and walkthroughs and translations because these games are very popular in the u.s.

656
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:19,070
Rym: Among anime fans and hardcore gamers.

657
00:44:19,351 --> 00:44:27,030
Scott: I think most of it has to do with the fact that a lot of them like I said card captor Sakura Tetris and Game like magical drop has an anime intro to it.

658
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:33,970
Scott: You know they're all anime characters or anime style characters that you're choosing from and that really appeals to anime fans.

659
00:44:35,271 --> 00:44:41,568
Scott: Something else you just want to warn anyone about who tries to play a Japanese PlayStation game because most of these are PlayStation games.

660
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:43,352
Scott: is That in America?

661
00:44:43,673 --> 00:44:53,010
Rym: X is yes, and you know square or triangle is which I never got because I played Japanese games from PlayStation Long before I ever played an actual English game.

662
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:54,896
Rym: It makes sense.

663
00:44:55,157 --> 00:44:56,501
Rym: circle yes X no.

664
00:44:56,621 --> 00:44:57,424
Rym: why did they change it?

665
00:44:57,464 --> 00:44:58,728
Scott: in America, I don't know.

666
00:44:58,969 --> 00:45:04,473
Scott: but In Japan and all these Japanese games circle is yes And X is no.

667
00:45:04,554 --> 00:45:08,567
Scott: so when you want to go through the menu to the game you have to push circle.

668
00:45:08,647 --> 00:45:11,740
Scott: if you push X You're gonna go back out into the menu again.

669
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,504
Scott: You don't want to do that.

670
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:23,598
Scott: I Just you know it gets a lot of people the first time they sit down to play one of these things And you're trying to progress through the menu and you get to the character select screen And they push X and you're like what did you do now?

671
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:27,730
Scott: We're gonna go back push circle, and then they push X again.

672
00:45:30,633 --> 00:45:31,301
Scott: It's like goddamn.

673
00:45:31,341 --> 00:45:31,928
Scott: it don't push X.

674
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:35,899
Rym: Yeah, so you just gotta have scrotch there to tell you what to do.

675
00:45:36,581 --> 00:45:39,390
Rym: I guess I guess we're thinking scrotch should become the mascot.

676
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:43,889
Rym: We're gonna try to get a picture of him off of the PlayStation game to put up for everyone to see.

677
00:45:44,453 --> 00:45:45,318
Scott: That's a good idea.

678
00:45:45,338 --> 00:45:47,190
Scott: I think it's absolutely necessary.

679
00:45:47,552 --> 00:45:53,064
Rym: Yeah, I haven't searched to see if anyone else has done it And I'm sure Adam is working on a better version of scrotch,

680
00:45:53,506 --> 00:45:57,532
Scott: and you know if You want to make scrotch do his thing make sure you push circle,

681
00:46:04,778 --> 00:46:07,420
Rym: and that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
