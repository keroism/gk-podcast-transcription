1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,402
Rym: It's Monday October 9th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:12,923 --> 00:00:17,781
Rym: tonight being science and technology night We're going to talk about codex for audio video and images.

3
00:00:18,222 --> 00:00:25,141
Rym: if you're one of our new listeners from sitcom Remember that Tuesday's are gaming days Wednesdays or anime and Thursdays are awesome.

4
00:00:25,502 --> 00:00:28,790
Rym: the actual coverage of the convention will of course be on Wednesday nights.

5
00:00:30,292 --> 00:00:31,307
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:32,255 --> 00:00:34,208
Rym: Well, we're back from a weekend at sitcom.

7
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,473
Rym: Hey It was a good time.

8
00:00:37,514 --> 00:00:42,750
Rym: I gotta say seeing the video game pianist and entertainment system live was pretty awesome.

9
00:00:43,053 --> 00:00:44,850
Scott: Yeah, they were indeed pretty awesome.

10
00:00:44,991 --> 00:00:51,233
Scott: And the only other place you can really see the video game pianist is like video games live which I think is gonna be in Brazil next.

11
00:00:51,353 --> 00:00:54,943
Scott: so yeah, it was a rare opportunity to you know.

12
00:00:55,023 --> 00:00:58,979
Scott: see him play for a relatively low price Close up in the u.s..

13
00:00:59,462 --> 00:00:59,663
Rym: Plus.

14
00:00:59,683 --> 00:01:02,823
Rym: We had to hang out with him afterward And he's a really cool guy.

15
00:01:03,044 --> 00:01:03,890
Scott: yeah, he's pretty cool.

16
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:08,246
Scott: He's way too modest man that dead I mean modesty is all noble and all.

17
00:01:08,286 --> 00:01:12,249
Scott: but he's really gotta Be more a little confident and at it.

18
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,042
Rym: Yeah, I mean people like us think we're a lot more awesome than we are.

19
00:01:15,163 --> 00:01:16,830
Rym: this kid doesn't realize just how awesome.

20
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,262
Scott: He's pretty much more awesome than everybody But he thinks he's like whatever plus.

21
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:27,485
Rym: the best part is you know we're all hanging around We're all in our mid-20s if not greater at this table, and then someone asked me how old are you?

22
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:29,609
Rym: he's like 19 We're all like.

23
00:01:31,816 --> 00:01:37,355
Scott: And then he's like you're not so old you're not so old we're like oh, yeah, okay, mr.. Mod is saying We're not so old.

24
00:01:37,778 --> 00:01:38,403
Scott: don't be modest.

25
00:01:38,444 --> 00:01:43,843
Rym: for us We're old Yeah, but of course to all of our new listeners.

26
00:01:43,863 --> 00:01:45,310
Rym: We may have picked up at sitacon.

27
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:49,690
Rym: We will be covering sitacon on Wednesday because that is anime manga comics day.

28
00:01:50,374 --> 00:01:52,247
Scott: Yep, that's when we're gonna cover it though.

29
00:01:52,308 --> 00:01:57,990
Rym: at first I would like to explain to any new listeners partly because we've been way overusing this joke.

30
00:01:58,654 --> 00:01:59,722
Rym: But a while ago.

31
00:01:59,763 --> 00:02:11,850
Rym: We had this thing of the day Which was these guys with a Brooklyn accent kind of watching Pokemon and yelling at it and at some point during the video You think the guy says like you can't lift ten Pokemon can't hold ten Pokemon.

32
00:02:12,771 --> 00:02:15,480
Scott: So now whenever we begin a sentence with you can't?

33
00:02:15,821 --> 00:02:18,750
Scott: it just turns into you can't ten something something.

34
00:02:19,751 --> 00:02:21,116
Rym: Yeah, we were doing this panel on.

35
00:02:21,177 --> 00:02:27,400
Rym: you know your anime socks or anime you like socks and every few minutes We're just like you can't make fun of ten anime.

36
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,825
Scott: You can't verb ten nouns.

37
00:02:29,207 --> 00:02:30,010
Rym: It's a bad thing.

38
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,006
Rym: So I thought I'd explain it to all of you who were a little confused by that.

39
00:02:33,328 --> 00:02:38,456
Scott: yeah Maybe I'll look up what day that Thing of the day was.

40
00:02:38,516 --> 00:02:47,010
Scott: but when you just go look search your Pokemon on front row crew calm And you'll find it, and then you'll get the inside joke of you can't verb ten nouns.

41
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:52,930
Rym: So anyway, there's really only one news today, so Scott has a little news to get out of the way.

42
00:02:53,211 --> 00:02:57,450
Scott: Yeah, okay little news is that there was some 100% carrot juice, and I don't remember.

43
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,201
Scott: I don't have the article in front of me right now.

44
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:07,729
Scott: I read it a few minutes ago and Some people in Toronto two people were paralyzed because there was botulism in the carrot juice.

45
00:03:07,929 --> 00:03:10,506
Scott: now The interesting part is that it was organic.

46
00:03:11,712 --> 00:03:14,318
Scott: Late you know is organic carrot juice.

47
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,160
Rym: so it went.

48
00:03:15,241 --> 00:03:18,910
Rym: it didn't go through the process that would have prevented botulism from happening.

49
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:21,016
Scott: Exactly you know a lot of people.

50
00:03:21,036 --> 00:03:34,970
Scott: they've done a really good job of marketing all these organic mostly fruits and vegetables You know but also dairy and meat products You know as organic and I guess there's some organic grains, but those really don't have as much of a problem?

51
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,492
Scott: I don't think.

52
00:03:35,794 --> 00:03:36,156
Scott: I don't know.

53
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,723
Scott: I'm not an expert.

54
00:03:37,743 --> 00:03:39,892
Scott: This is secondhand knowledge here You know.

55
00:03:40,293 --> 00:03:49,445
Scott: but anyway the thing is when someone says organic that means they do less Science to it, and if you're a hippie that kind of thing sounds great.

56
00:03:49,465 --> 00:03:50,630
Scott: you'd be like oh, it's more healthy.

57
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:56,425
Scott: It doesn't have pesticides or hormones or all these sorts of evil things that other hippies come up with.

58
00:03:56,465 --> 00:03:59,976
Scott: that sound really bad because they're Chemicals and they're unnatural.

59
00:03:59,996 --> 00:04:00,900
Rym: remember at the same time.

60
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,703
Rym: It's not all bad.

61
00:04:01,723 --> 00:04:03,230
Rym: I mean some organic food is really good.

62
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,764
Rym: I mean if you get an unpasteurized orange juice.

63
00:04:05,804 --> 00:04:06,689
Rym: It's the bomb.

64
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:09,548
Scott: yeah It's a. it's the bomb for about two days before it turns into the poison.

65
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:10,814
Scott: yeah Yeah, you know.

66
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:14,050
Scott: and I yeah picking an apple off the tree is always gonna taste better.

67
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:20,913
Scott: But that's not because it's organically grown That's because you are very close to the place It is growing.

68
00:04:20,952 --> 00:04:34,825
Scott: the reason fruits and vegetables in places like the Northeast where we live the Northeast us Suck is because those things are taken off the tree You know frozen or something shipped a very long distance and then eaten.

69
00:04:34,845 --> 00:04:39,921
Scott: if you go to Florida to get oranges They're all awesome because they're freaking traveled.

70
00:04:40,202 --> 00:04:41,526
Scott: You know they're one day ago.

71
00:04:41,586 --> 00:04:42,570
Scott: They were picked off the tree.

72
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:47,650
Rym: Yep, I mean there's some hippies here who make their own locally grown salsa, and it's really freaking good.

73
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,214
Scott: Yeah Cuz it was grown right here.

74
00:04:49,435 --> 00:04:53,026
Scott: not because it's organic and organic stuff isn't any healthier.

75
00:04:53,408 --> 00:05:00,010
Scott: all that shit about Franken food where they genetically engineer it to be bigger or seedless or anything like that.

76
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,922
Scott: That's all a bunch of hokey bringing any.

77
00:05:03,163 --> 00:05:04,670
Scott: any fruit or vegetable is awesome.

78
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:08,246
Scott: You know if you eat a giant strawberry or a square watermelon.

79
00:05:08,286 --> 00:05:09,110
Scott: It's not gonna hurt you.

80
00:05:09,211 --> 00:05:11,490
Scott: It's not any different from a regular watermelon.

81
00:05:11,971 --> 00:05:15,181
Rym: But the thing is what about those poison watermelons in Iraq?

82
00:05:15,322 --> 00:05:15,783
Scott: That's true.

83
00:05:15,803 --> 00:05:17,509
Scott: You don't want to poison Iraqi watermelon.

84
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:27,783
Scott: however If something says organic on it that means that it went through less Science and our friend it went through less science.

85
00:05:27,843 --> 00:05:31,970
Scott: and our friend who's tests food Who was on the show a long time ago for a living?

86
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:47,595
Scott: He says that he would not choose to eat organic foods because while many of them probably won't hurt you the quantity of Bacteria and other things like that that are in them are higher than in the foods that went through more scientific Processes.

87
00:05:47,696 --> 00:05:49,790
Rym: I remember he's talking more about processed food.

88
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,526
Rym: I mean like if you take fruit and make a juice out of it.

89
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:59,290
Rym: organically I mean organic fruits and vegetables aren't really any different and just have less pesticide on them usually and usually.

90
00:06:00,032 --> 00:06:02,200
Scott: But you know and they also more expensive.

91
00:06:02,842 --> 00:06:12,068
Scott: the even even if you know the regular Unprocessed fruits and vegetables, you know are organic and that doesn't necessarily mean they're gonna be poison or anything like that.

92
00:06:12,148 --> 00:06:14,828
Scott: Spinach was They.

93
00:06:15,851 --> 00:06:16,694
Scott: They're too expensive.

94
00:06:17,135 --> 00:06:20,306
Rym: Yeah, whatever you can rant about organic foods as much as you want.

95
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:24,119
Scott: and yeah Those people with their organic foods they bother me.

96
00:06:24,481 --> 00:06:27,070
Rym: Well, yeah, I'm just you rant about it all the time and it's annoying.

97
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,344
Scott: Hey, they're they're worse more annoying things to rant about.

98
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:32,629
Rym: Yeah, would you often do?

99
00:06:33,412 --> 00:06:34,798
Scott: What do you want from me?

100
00:06:34,898 --> 00:06:36,083
Rym: so what's your big news?

101
00:06:36,143 --> 00:06:36,946
Rym: the one that you wanted to have?

102
00:06:36,966 --> 00:06:37,970
Rym: only one news for today?

103
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,442
Scott: Oh the 101. why I have both news is your news.

104
00:06:41,703 --> 00:06:43,270
Scott: My news is the organic carrot juice.

105
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:44,190
Rym: Alright fine.

106
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,838
Rym: Then my news is that Google bought YouTube for one point.

107
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,930
Rym: six five billion dollars in stock the biggest news on the internet in a long time, holy crap.

108
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,669
Scott: It's insane.

109
00:06:54,430 --> 00:07:03,620
Rym: Google the biggest people on the internet bought the biggest video on the internet for a lot of freaking money right after a whole bunch Analysts basically said that YouTube is worthless.

110
00:07:03,942 --> 00:07:04,705
Scott: I mean, holy shit.

111
00:07:04,765 --> 00:07:05,850
Scott: What were those guys at YouTube?

112
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:09,222
Scott: They're finally they're probably all nervous every single day of their lives.

113
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,366
Scott: Like god damn it.

114
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:11,570
Scott: We made this big monster.

115
00:07:11,671 --> 00:07:12,559
Scott: We're gonna be ruined.

116
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,104
Scott: What do we do?

117
00:07:14,911 --> 00:07:19,485
Scott: Today they probably freaking that sire a leaf just wave like I felt it over here.

118
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:20,909
Scott: It was so big.

119
00:07:22,051 --> 00:07:23,477
Scott: No, but I mean think about it.

120
00:07:23,557 --> 00:07:26,810
Scott: Most of what we do on the internet nowadays is looking at videos and shit.

121
00:07:27,633 --> 00:07:32,830
Scott: Now for both places that we get it from or combined into one.

122
00:07:33,191 --> 00:07:41,956
Rym: I mean really the only places that had good videos on the internet were YouTube and Google video and now they're gonna be one in the same presumably eventually maybe.

123
00:07:41,976 --> 00:07:49,790
Scott: and they said YouTube will retain its distinct brand identity and They're keeping you know, the employees and everything else.

124
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:53,766
Rym: But if anything I'll bet Google video will just index everything on YouTube and vice versa.

125
00:07:53,786 --> 00:07:54,810
Scott: That would be cool.

126
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,219
Scott: They were like both the same site, but you could choose the interface.

127
00:07:57,239 --> 00:08:03,218
Scott: I really hope this is just one Flash application for displaying the video.

128
00:08:03,258 --> 00:08:07,050
Scott: that's on both sites because I really like the Google video one a lot more than the YouTube one.

129
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:15,650
Scott: Yeah No But apparently the these accompanying news is all the deals that they had with legitimate entertainment companies.

130
00:08:15,882 --> 00:08:24,654
Rym: Yeah I mean Google had video or had deals with Sony BMG music and Warner music over music videos where some sort of Profit-sharing royalties thing.

131
00:08:24,734 --> 00:08:35,369
Scott: Yeah, they did that today and before that YouTube made a deal with Warner in September and YouTube also made a deal with Sony and Universal today and whatever.

132
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:38,378
Scott: They're just deals going around with all the media companies.

133
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:46,623
Scott: But the big one is the one with CBS where basically now CBS is gonna give content to YouTube.

134
00:08:47,045 --> 00:08:47,588
Scott: That's okay.

135
00:08:47,608 --> 00:08:53,322
Scott: and As If people post something on YouTube CBS is gonna look at it.

136
00:08:53,823 --> 00:09:02,787
Scott: and if it was something that was recorded off of CBS CBS is gonna be basically either get the final say as in yes, they can go on YouTube or no it can't.

137
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:09,570
Scott: and if they Say yes Then CBS is gonna get a cut of the advertising money from that page.

138
00:09:10,253 --> 00:09:16,925
Scott: So if CBS let something go online from its network Then they're gonna get money whenever people look at it.

139
00:09:17,227 --> 00:09:23,764
Rym: now on one hand It's a smart move by Google because this puts the onus of copyright enforcement on someone else.

140
00:09:24,205 --> 00:09:29,889
Rym: if CBS lets something go through Google can't be blamed because they let CBS decide if it goes through or not.

141
00:09:30,514 --> 00:09:32,689
Scott: On the other hand, we got CBS looking at all our stuff.

142
00:09:33,713 --> 00:09:35,103
Rym: Yeah, we'll have to see exact I hope.

143
00:09:35,144 --> 00:09:40,526
Rym: I mean I hope the EULA's or the various licenses around all this stuff don't change in terms of like.

144
00:09:40,586 --> 00:09:44,779
Rym: if you put a video on YouTube Then rights get transferred or yeah,

145
00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:55,461
Scott: this could be a real problem if people start feeling like you know I mean people use YouTube because a lot like the flicker of video, you know It's people putting their stuff up for other people to see.

146
00:09:55,481 --> 00:10:12,152
Scott: if the combination of Google video YouTube and all these media companies turns it into more of a Corporate kind of video thing and not you know, the people's video thing You're gonna see a lot of competitors show up and possibly kick its ass, you know, and it's on the internet We've seen.

147
00:10:12,172 --> 00:10:14,943
Scott: you know, you might think oh, no one could beat such a monster.

148
00:10:15,003 --> 00:10:15,645
Scott: It's so big.

149
00:10:15,665 --> 00:10:16,750
Scott: There's no way to win.

150
00:10:17,532 --> 00:10:19,838
Scott: It's happened on the internet a lot of freakin times.

151
00:10:19,898 --> 00:10:22,264
Scott: I mean the the friendster dead.

152
00:10:22,364 --> 00:10:24,390
Scott: myspace is the win or cut dead.

153
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:25,875
Scott: Yeah, myspace is the win.

154
00:10:25,915 --> 00:10:27,059
Scott: lots of things go down.

155
00:10:27,099 --> 00:10:30,189
Scott: I mean Alta Vista and Yahoo down Google up.

156
00:10:30,992 --> 00:10:39,267
Rym: It happens every day and it's not always like the best thing wins because no offense to people out there But myspace is the bottom of the internet.

157
00:10:39,367 --> 00:10:39,850
Scott: It's shite.

158
00:10:40,815 --> 00:10:45,918
Rym: You said shite purely because I said shite all week, that's right I don't know why for some reason all weekend.

159
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,665
Rym: I just said shite instead of shit.

160
00:10:48,007 --> 00:10:48,629
Scott: That's what you do.

161
00:10:48,911 --> 00:10:50,041
Rym: I guess it just sounded funnier.

162
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:50,425
Rym: I don't know.

163
00:10:51,171 --> 00:10:51,773
Scott: Yeah, but this is.

164
00:10:51,873 --> 00:10:56,289
Scott: this is gonna be mean big news for the future of awesome internet geekeries.

165
00:10:56,891 --> 00:11:04,790
Rym: Yeah, one company for your internet video needs one ring to rule them all and in the darkness of the style project bind them.

166
00:11:04,995 --> 00:11:06,210
Scott: Oh, no Oh god.

167
00:11:08,413 --> 00:11:14,303
Scott: Hopefully this will bring more good than bad But I feel an even dose of both coming this way.

168
00:11:14,323 --> 00:11:18,297
Rym: if anything I look at it this way Google is smart.

169
00:11:18,738 --> 00:11:22,030
Rym: the people who make decisions at Google know what they're doing.

170
00:11:22,371 --> 00:11:23,415
Scott: Yeah, they're way smarter than us.

171
00:11:23,575 --> 00:11:27,410
Rym: if Google bought YouTube Google's got something planned.

172
00:11:27,611 --> 00:11:38,381
Scott: They know exactly what they're up against all the problem Obviously done the math on some way to combine adsense and YouTube and Google video to actually make some monies.

173
00:11:38,662 --> 00:11:41,552
Rym: this will probably put the nail in the coffin of you know Cuz I don't.

174
00:11:41,592 --> 00:11:45,309
Rym: Microsoft kind of wanted to have a video thing and Yahoo wanted to have a video thing.

175
00:11:45,731 --> 00:11:47,117
Rym: Those things have no chance now.

176
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:49,930
Scott: Yeah, I think they're really how Google's doing it?

177
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:57,870
Scott: I if you see if you look at a lot of the other newses about Google It's like they're fighting for a new standard of power supplies that are just 12 volts.

178
00:11:58,293 --> 00:12:07,114
Scott: They're fighting to have these like Mainframe server farms in a box things that they can put all over the country, you know These are the kind of things they're going for.

179
00:12:07,154 --> 00:12:21,489
Scott: they're trying to find a way to make it cheaper to do things that require Insane amounts of processing and insane amounts of bandwidth all over the world and by cutting those costs They're able to do things like YouTube for less money.

180
00:12:21,851 --> 00:12:28,670
Scott: Then people like YouTube can do it for the old-fashioned way of having a billion fiber optic cables in a giant server farm somewhere.

181
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:29,473
Rym: And don't forget.

182
00:12:29,493 --> 00:12:31,502
Rym: I mean Google has all that dark fiber.

183
00:12:31,783 --> 00:12:32,426
Scott: Yeah, Google.

184
00:12:32,446 --> 00:12:33,250
Scott: Yeah, that's another thing.

185
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:36,490
Scott: They're doing the dark fiber and their own Wi-Fi, you know.

186
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:45,134
Scott: They're cutting the cost on the back end to make insane internet applications more feasible when supported merely by Google adsense ads.

187
00:12:45,295 --> 00:12:50,672
Rym: I mean Google is like a spider now and they're going out in every direction and trying to take over like Everything.

188
00:12:50,712 --> 00:12:56,230
Rym: but I mean eat for some reason unlike, you know when Microsoft and AOL have always tried to do things like that in the past.

189
00:12:57,091 --> 00:13:02,370
Rym: They're really not being evil as far as anyone can tell and everyone seems to be backing them.

190
00:13:02,932 --> 00:13:13,084
Scott: I mean if Microsoft did the same thing if Microsoft bought YouTube the news would have been Microsoft ruins YouTube, you know That wouldn't have been actually so bad if you think about it because they could have combined it.

191
00:13:13,184 --> 00:13:20,450
Scott: if if they would have handled it If they would have combined it with the Zune and the Xbox 360 then it would have been hot.

192
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:21,738
Scott: I might even go for that.

193
00:13:21,758 --> 00:13:23,770
Rym: Yeah, if I could subscribe no better yet.

194
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:29,990
Scott: You have the Zune right which is this portable thing and it has Wi-Fi and you can watch YouTube on it anywhere.

195
00:13:30,556 --> 00:13:31,629
Scott: That would have been so hot.

196
00:13:33,555 --> 00:13:36,283
Scott: Like imagine if the iPod with video could watch YouTube.

197
00:13:36,323 --> 00:13:37,005
Scott: that would be wicked.

198
00:13:37,226 --> 00:13:45,037
Rym: not even that saying my Xbox I could subscribe to like the YouTube top 100 channel and watch him in HD And just watch.

199
00:13:45,218 --> 00:13:47,789
Rym: well HD wouldn't really matter with YouTube haha.

200
00:13:48,051 --> 00:13:55,875
Scott: but I'm saying they could make it hotter for the Xbox 360 folk because they know that they're not gonna be able to pirate the Content through their Xbox granite.

201
00:13:55,895 --> 00:13:58,041
Rym: We can't speculate about that because that didn't happen.

202
00:13:58,563 --> 00:14:00,910
Rym: Oh, we know what happened and it's probably better.

203
00:14:01,422 --> 00:14:01,670
Scott: Yeah.

204
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:09,350
Rym: But I mean it is interesting that any other big company really geeks and people in the know generally don't trust them at all.

205
00:14:09,712 --> 00:14:12,350
Scott: But a lot of people keep saying they don't trust Google.

206
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:12,891
Scott: No, they don't.

207
00:14:12,932 --> 00:14:14,155
Scott: they haven't done anything yet.

208
00:14:14,195 --> 00:14:19,930
Rym: people who don't trust Google are old people and a very very vocal minority.

209
00:14:20,394 --> 00:14:24,878
Rym: Yeah, they did do that China stuff though Yeah, but look at what Yahoo did in China.

210
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:28,510
Rym: Google's policy is we're not going to harm the Chinese citizens.

211
00:14:28,691 --> 00:14:29,717
Rym: It's not their fault.

212
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,870
Rym: So what we're gonna do is censor what they want.

213
00:14:32,231 --> 00:14:36,047
Rym: Well, we'll put a big thing saying we censored something because of your government.

214
00:14:36,329 --> 00:14:39,486
Rym: Mm-hmm They turn the dude in and he got arrested.

215
00:14:39,747 --> 00:14:42,299
Rym: yeah Google is probably doing the best.

216
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:51,169
Rym: I mean the only choices here are to Either screw the Chinese people and hope that they get mad at their government or do whatever you can to help the Chinese people out.

217
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,438
Scott: Of course, you can't yell at Yahoo too much.

218
00:14:53,498 --> 00:14:58,394
Scott: They do provide flicker and delicious, which I use freaking every damn day All the time.

219
00:14:58,414 --> 00:15:01,527
Rym: I mean there was a time when Yahoo is my preferred search engine.

220
00:15:01,728 --> 00:15:12,730
Rym: Yeah in 1996 give or take 1998 after 97 or 98 Alta Vista digital started getting me bad results and every other search engine just sucked.

221
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:16,848
Scott: Yeah, remember back in the day when search engines would link you to dead sites that were 404s.

222
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:24,970
Rym: Those are crazy times or when search engines all gave you completely different results and didn't index the same pages.

223
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:26,234
Scott: Yeah, you know what.

224
00:15:26,495 --> 00:15:27,860
Scott: at the very least I think.

225
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:35,049
Scott: now searching on YouTube just searching YouTube for videos We'll get better because it'll be a Google search and not a YouTube search whatever that works.

226
00:15:35,311 --> 00:15:38,410
Rym: Let's notice how Google paid in stock and not in cash.

227
00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:42,489
Rym: So say this is a bad move and Google stock tanks.

228
00:15:43,534 --> 00:15:46,850
Rym: The more Google stock goes down the less they paid for YouTube.

229
00:15:47,424 --> 00:15:50,819
Scott: Yeah But it says right here YouTube will retain its the secret.

230
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:58,927
Scott: its backers will retain a shed load of Google shares which no doubt will be converted into readies as soon as possible.

231
00:15:59,007 --> 00:16:03,849
Scott: and There is no doubt they're selling all those shares right now.

232
00:16:04,977 --> 00:16:16,137
Scott: As soon as the market opens tomorrow Google stock price is gonna go down a bit and get cheap from those YouTube guys selling all those shares for cash and going to buy new Ferraris.

233
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,588
Scott: and then you see the Google stock will be cheap.

234
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:22,675
Scott: and Because they bought YouTube a whole bunch of stock guys are gonna buy it and it'll go back up.

235
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:33,394
Rym: Yeah things of the day Which day?

236
00:16:33,434 --> 00:16:34,561
Scott: we've been gone for three days.

237
00:16:34,581 --> 00:16:36,190
Scott: I have no idea what the hell happened in this world.

238
00:16:36,651 --> 00:16:37,193
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

239
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:39,943
Rym: It doesn't matter because something happened back at RIT.

240
00:16:40,424 --> 00:16:48,550
Rym: Now the college we went to RIT the Rochester Institute of Technology Decided while we were there to build a monstrosity.

241
00:16:49,951 --> 00:16:57,170
Rym: Now a lot of campuses have a monstrosity, you know a big ugly statue was something RIT decided to get a statue of a knight.

242
00:16:57,772 --> 00:17:04,535
Scott: But the statue of the knight I mean a statue of a knight when if you tell me that I'm like, yes That's awesome.

243
00:17:04,675 --> 00:17:05,719
Scott: a knight a knigget.

244
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:09,690
Rym: it's a knight made out of metal scrap garbage.

245
00:17:09,871 --> 00:17:11,817
Rym: Basically, it's a pile of scrap metal.

246
00:17:11,857 --> 00:17:13,021
Scott: It's a rust knigget.

247
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,125
Scott: It got rust hurricane.

248
00:17:14,224 --> 00:17:14,707
Rym: Nothing is.

249
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:15,710
Rym: it doesn't look that bad.

250
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:21,432
Rym: I mean a lot of people complained about it when it went in but that was mostly because it was RIT and the students There.

251
00:17:21,452 --> 00:17:25,969
Rym: if anything changes for the better or for the worse people will bitch about it.

252
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:30,365
Scott: Well, I mean I could kind of understand the fact that it was a lot of money.

253
00:17:30,385 --> 00:17:32,994
Scott: was like 14 million dollars Yeah, but it was.

254
00:17:33,055 --> 00:17:34,521
Scott: it was a lot of my nervous 14.

255
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:35,485
Scott: Yeah, it was millions.

256
00:17:35,545 --> 00:17:39,098
Scott: Oh, maybe was the The cop the GCIS.

257
00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:40,162
Scott: that was 14 million.

258
00:17:40,423 --> 00:17:40,684
Rym: No.

259
00:17:40,704 --> 00:17:42,572
Rym: No, the Sentinel was millions and millions It was.

260
00:17:42,653 --> 00:17:44,670
Scott: it was a lot of freaking money for this giant.

261
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,148
Rym: So the Golisano building cost a lot more than 14 million.

262
00:17:47,571 --> 00:17:50,670
Scott: Well, I think that's what Golisano gave and I don't remember exactly.

263
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,514
Scott: I'm just remembering.

264
00:17:51,514 --> 00:17:53,020
Scott: 14 million is some number.

265
00:17:53,302 --> 00:17:57,260
Rym: students complain like first they were like Oh They waste our money on this.

266
00:17:57,381 --> 00:17:58,286
Rym: and then RIT was like.

267
00:17:58,528 --> 00:18:04,110
Rym: actually That money was all donated by people specifically to build that and we didn't take any of your money at all.

268
00:18:04,392 --> 00:18:09,160
Rym: yep, and then people like well, it's ugly and It's not that ugly.

269
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,589
Scott: I mean, it's pretty bad.

270
00:18:10,871 --> 00:18:12,114
Scott: I mean the others.

271
00:18:12,154 --> 00:18:19,476
Scott: the existing statues around RIT are better like the sundial and the infinity Which are wicked cool.

272
00:18:19,536 --> 00:18:24,757
Rym: See I think it actually fits into the campus pretty well, and it's yeah ugly Like all the buildings made of brick.

273
00:18:24,877 --> 00:18:25,118
Scott: It's hot.

274
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:26,163
Scott: It's made of rusty.

275
00:18:26,223 --> 00:18:27,870
Rym: No, I don't think the buildings are ugly either.

276
00:18:27,971 --> 00:18:30,410
Rym: I think RIT's campus looks really good, especially in the summer.

277
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:34,750
Scott: It does it does it looks okay despite if you like bricks and I kind of like bricks.

278
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:40,810
Rym: But the thing is just that people at RIT complain no matter what and the only complaint I have with the Sentinel.

279
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,949
Rym: Is that what they should have built is a 90-foot tiger?

280
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:50,528
Scott: Now there's already a tiger which is the best damn tiger only because it's balls get spray-painted gold every year.

281
00:18:50,548 --> 00:18:50,990
Rym: Awesome.

282
00:18:51,251 --> 00:18:53,421
Scott: No, they should have built a freakin.

283
00:18:53,843 --> 00:18:57,969
Scott: if they built an actual night It would have been much that wouldn't have fit in at all with RIT.

284
00:18:58,951 --> 00:19:00,542
Rym: Mmm, the thing is the Sentinel fits in.

285
00:19:00,562 --> 00:19:01,790
Rym: you got it looks pretty good.

286
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,106
Scott: It kind of fits in a little bit.

287
00:19:03,329 --> 00:19:09,168
Rym: now the thing is the students regardless of how nice the Sentinel actually is bitched about it and bitched about it.

288
00:19:09,308 --> 00:19:14,600
Rym: and while we were at RIT we Inspired several times to prank it in some way.

289
00:19:14,761 --> 00:19:15,163
Scott: Well, of course.

290
00:19:15,183 --> 00:19:17,010
Scott: I said everyone was thinking all the time.

291
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,458
Rym: Yeah, we were like should we TP it?

292
00:19:18,618 --> 00:19:20,750
Rym: Nah, should we run a pirate flag up on it?

293
00:19:21,392 --> 00:19:22,676
Rym: Should we thermite it?

294
00:19:22,857 --> 00:19:26,890
Rym: Nah, and we just never got around to pranking it because we were seniors and then we all laugh.

295
00:19:26,931 --> 00:19:27,810
Rym: So we didn't care anymore.

296
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:33,650
Scott: Yeah, the Sentinel went from a thing everyone complained about to something everyone walked by on their way to class to a joke.

297
00:19:34,511 --> 00:19:39,447
Rym: Yeah, so finally now that we're gone some people actually pranked the Sentinel.

298
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:42,110
Rym: hooray now They did it in a classically geeky way.

299
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:48,469
Rym: They took a bunch of throw ease which take an LED and a battery tape them together And now you've got a little light.

300
00:19:48,891 --> 00:19:53,567
Rym: That's a throwing and you put the tape like double-sided tape on it and you throw it somewhere.

301
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:55,032
Rym: and now you got this light stuck To something.

302
00:19:55,493 --> 00:19:55,634
Scott: Yep.

303
00:19:55,955 --> 00:19:59,326
Scott: So you use the tape that you use to attach the LED to the battery.

304
00:19:59,386 --> 00:20:00,651
Scott: is also the tape that makes it Stick.

305
00:20:00,873 --> 00:20:02,846
Rym: Well, yeah, you just wrap it a double-sided tape.

306
00:20:02,987 --> 00:20:10,609
Rym: Yep, and People they cover the Sentinel in this thing and then they ran a pirate flag up it Whoo-hoo, and then they put pictures on to internet.

307
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:17,617
Rym: Of course the news is that RIT took all of them down almost immediately.

308
00:20:17,637 --> 00:20:22,311
Rym: Oh Well, the guy who did it is awesome.

309
00:20:22,452 --> 00:20:23,619
Rym: And that's my thing of the day.

310
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,830
Scott: Yeah, RIT just doesn't understand.

311
00:20:27,272 --> 00:20:29,160
Scott: They should really capitalize on that sort of thing.

312
00:20:29,441 --> 00:20:36,595
Scott: I mean if RIT left it up and even like praise the students who did it You know that would send a message to the whole world like hey come to RIT.

313
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:37,640
Scott: It's an awesome place to go.

314
00:20:37,922 --> 00:20:39,300
Rym: You know what sends the message to the world?

315
00:20:40,783 --> 00:20:44,985
Rym: The fact that they have two OC threes connected to the internet, oh It's true.

316
00:20:45,005 --> 00:20:46,538
Rym: That's the only reason I went to RIT.

317
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:50,989
Scott: That was one of that got him in this one Who they have major and I didn't even know.

318
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,140
Rym: I thought they had a t3 and I was impressed by that.

319
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:59,534
Rym: I get there like we don't have a t3 and before I could say what fuckers lied to me They said we have two OC threes and a t3.

320
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:00,420
Scott: even no one knows either.

321
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:05,119
Scott: He was where I went to ri3 and RIT and that's why I knew that's where I wanted to go.

322
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:06,365
Rym: Yeah, so what do you got?

323
00:21:07,168 --> 00:21:10,000
Scott: So this dude is this kind of technology right here.

324
00:21:10,441 --> 00:21:12,993
Scott: He you know how if you know if it's opened up a hard drive.

325
00:21:13,415 --> 00:21:18,359
Scott: first of all in any hard drive There's a wicked powerful motor that's small but spins discs really fast.

326
00:21:18,942 --> 00:21:25,518
Scott: There's also a bunch of discs usually three and they're nice heavy metal thick magnetic discs.

327
00:21:26,461 --> 00:21:30,969
Scott: they're just basically like CDs only solid metal and fat and magnetic.

328
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:39,449
Scott: and This guy takes a whole bunch of floppy drive platters Which are the discs in the floppy drives puts them on one motor?

329
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,198
Scott: Spins them up real fast and lets them go.

330
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:47,360
Scott: and then if you think about the physics You'll know what happens to them.

331
00:21:48,023 --> 00:21:49,570
Scott: and then you watch and you go.

332
00:21:49,716 --> 00:21:55,110
Scott: Oh, yeah That's what would totally happen if you did that and then he throws in a curveball at the end of the video and it's awesome.

333
00:21:55,552 --> 00:21:59,487
Rym: The video is funny and short and worth watching very worth what else can I say?

334
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:01,405
Scott: very short That's all there is to it.

335
00:22:02,812 --> 00:22:05,970
Rym: So on to the main bit which is kind of a cop-out.

336
00:22:06,613 --> 00:22:07,838
Scott: It's not really a cop-out.

337
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:10,469
Rym: today's is a cop-out because it is the overview of what we're gonna do.

338
00:22:11,165 --> 00:22:33,815
Scott: Yeah so this week and the following three weeks we're going to talk about something a lot of people don't understand and have problems with and That is dealing with many different sorts of file formats mostly video ones, but also audio and image ones Specifically the compressed formats that involve words like codec and Container and such.

339
00:22:34,196 --> 00:22:39,030
Rym: now a lot of people have trouble trouble with this and us included sometimes.

340
00:22:39,251 --> 00:22:45,166
Rym: Yeah, the thing is normally when it comes to computer stuff We always make fun of people like ah, you don't know about blah blah blah.

341
00:22:45,186 --> 00:22:45,970
Rym: You must be stupid.

342
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:53,650
Rym: but when it comes to codecs It changes so fast and so often and it's not like there's a central repository or a website.

343
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:57,309
Rym: That's like here's a list of all the codecs out there and all the containers how to use it

344
00:22:57,972 --> 00:23:07,730
Scott: And it's not like it's very easy to tell unless you're using Linux Exactly, which codec in which format a specific file is using and whether you have the right thing or not.

345
00:23:08,111 --> 00:23:13,290
Rym: yeah, plus a lot of people will download a player for a codec not knowing that they could just get the codec.

346
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,748
Rym: or Some codecs cost money.

347
00:23:16,533 --> 00:23:19,690
Rym: Sometimes it's sometimes you can play a file, but you can't make a file.

348
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:30,970
Scott: Sometimes there's different places to get the codec from like you can get the official real player or you can get some other thing That also does it and you always get the bad ones and you get stuff that doesn't work it with each other.

349
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:35,070
Scott: So then you end up being able to play certain files and not others and different players.

350
00:23:35,451 --> 00:23:40,590
Rym: Yes, a lot of programs don't like you have to install codecs in them for them to work.

351
00:23:41,194 --> 00:23:48,290
Scott: Yeah, it's a crazy mixed-up world But hopefully we will tell you the under workings and also how you can get stuff to work.

352
00:23:48,751 --> 00:23:52,968
Rym: In the very least we'll learn a lot as we do a bunch of research for all this.

353
00:23:52,988 --> 00:24:00,530
Scott: All right Well, the first thing I think we have to explain is what is the point of all these formats?

354
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:01,648
Scott: Why do they exist?

355
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,337
Rym: I mean the word is codec.

356
00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:06,050
Rym: now codec is is kind of like modem.

357
00:24:06,532 --> 00:24:07,878
Rym: modem is it's the same kind of word.

358
00:24:07,938 --> 00:24:13,113
Rym: modem is not a word so much as modulator Demodulator.

359
00:24:13,394 --> 00:24:20,443
Rym: and then they shorten that to modem because you don't want to say hey, I bought a new 336k modulator demodulator today.

360
00:24:20,463 --> 00:24:29,190
Scott: Yep codec means compressor Decompressor or coder decoder or compression decompression or encoding decoding or whatever?

361
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:32,630
Rym: This is digital compression not analog compression.

362
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:35,881
Rym: We use analog compression and digital compression to make GeekNights.

363
00:24:36,243 --> 00:24:39,254
Rym: digital compression is like making an mp3 Mm-hmm.

364
00:24:39,496 --> 00:24:40,848
Rym: In fact, that's exactly what it is.

365
00:24:41,211 --> 00:24:42,998
Scott: You see there are two steps in this process.

366
00:24:43,058 --> 00:24:47,879
Scott: really is what we're talking about is images Audio and video.

367
00:24:47,999 --> 00:24:49,570
Scott: Those are all analog things.

368
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:59,610
Scott: they involve waves slash particles of light and waves of sound and You have to convert those in order to use them in a computing environment into a zeros and ones.

369
00:25:00,171 --> 00:25:08,659
Scott: So you have an electrical signal that varies in voltage wildly and you have to turn that into an electrical signal That is either zero or five volts.

370
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:14,684
Rym: now take the uh, maybe without losing information I'll take images just because this is the best easiest one to explain.

371
00:25:14,745 --> 00:25:15,528
Rym: Is this the simplest?

372
00:25:15,709 --> 00:25:15,890
Rym: Mm-hmm?

373
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:16,634
Rym: So what do you do?

374
00:25:16,714 --> 00:25:19,890
Rym: The first early one simply would say I've got X pixels.

375
00:25:20,331 --> 00:25:26,370
Rym: I'll figure out what color each pixel would be to look as close to that thing as I can and then I'll save a file.

376
00:25:26,711 --> 00:25:31,089
Rym: That's just a line of numbers that tell what every pixels color has to be.

377
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:31,715
Scott: So like.

378
00:25:31,736 --> 00:25:36,690
Scott: let's say you have a Image file on your computer and there are two possible colors black and white.

379
00:25:37,192 --> 00:25:39,383
Scott: So the first pixel is the first bit.

380
00:25:39,423 --> 00:25:40,850
Scott: it's either a zero or a one.

381
00:25:41,292 --> 00:25:45,330
Scott: So it's just a bunch of zeros and ones and you go through one pixel at a time.

382
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,762
Scott: It goes zero black one white zero black one white.

383
00:25:48,822 --> 00:25:51,230
Scott: and that's how it's done convert analog to digital.

384
00:25:52,072 --> 00:25:59,290
Scott: The second thing you need to do is realize that hey if you get a really big picture, that's gonna be a really big file.

385
00:25:59,932 --> 00:26:08,570
Rym: Thus we have compression where they use tricks and algorithms and various things which we'll talk about in much more detail to Compress it to make it smaller.

386
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:18,649
Rym: So instead of having to say like say you have you know this picture and you can figure out looking at it mathematically that Hey, the whole second half of this thing is just ones

387
00:26:19,532 --> 00:26:30,769
Scott: It'd be easier to say yeah put a hundred ones here instead of actually having a hundred ones Because the number a hundred takes up less memory than a hundred actual ones do.

388
00:26:31,652 --> 00:26:31,893
Scott: That's.

389
00:26:32,053 --> 00:26:37,430
Scott: that's just a very simple example of the kind of things that you do to compress digital files.

390
00:26:38,012 --> 00:26:39,720
Scott: This gets even worse if you try to do.

391
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,030
Scott: video is now you don't have just one picture.

392
00:26:42,331 --> 00:26:50,619
Scott: You've got a jillion pictures like 30 pictures a second and you've got an audio track also Yep, and maybe a subtitle track.

393
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,310
Scott: Yeah, God God knows what else you've got in there.

394
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:56,709
Rym: You might have like 5.1 surround sound mixed in with all this.

395
00:26:56,831 --> 00:27:01,770
Scott: Yeah You might want to have like three different languages and five different subtitle tracks.

396
00:27:01,971 --> 00:27:04,523
Scott: You might have alternate angles on the video file.

397
00:27:04,745 --> 00:27:08,882
Scott: when you get this kind of stuff You need to take up a whole DVD with it and DVDs like 4.3 gigs.

398
00:27:09,022 --> 00:27:09,424
Scott: It's crazy.

399
00:27:11,372 --> 00:27:19,150
Rym: Plus at this point there's another step up and we talk about codex But a lot of people get confused between codex and what would actually be called containers.

400
00:27:19,451 --> 00:27:30,879
Rym: Yes, very briefly the easiest way to explain this with AVI is it used to be that AVI Was a container and a file format because it was just raw Basically pictures in a row.

401
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,490
Scott: Well, it kind of is sort of well.

402
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,958
Rym: Yeah, but I mean AVI you could tell someone.

403
00:27:36,098 --> 00:27:39,549
Rym: Oh, this is an AVI file and all AVI files were the same.

404
00:27:40,271 --> 00:27:43,921
Scott: AVI file is basically the default video file.

405
00:27:44,061 --> 00:27:47,290
Scott: It is a completely uncompressed normal video file.

406
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:50,885
Scott: We're not talking about the container, but the codex AVI is nothing.

407
00:27:50,965 --> 00:27:52,010
Scott: It's just a bunch of bitmaps.

408
00:27:52,331 --> 00:27:58,497
Rym: But the thing is now, I mean a lot of divixes are dot AVI But the codex was divix.

409
00:27:58,537 --> 00:27:59,500
Rym: So how come it's still AVI?

410
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:02,590
Rym: How come my old player can't play these new AVI files?

411
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:03,570
Rym: They have the same extension.

412
00:28:04,031 --> 00:28:09,870
Rym: Well, it turns out that the container can hold all different kinds of video streams in it.

413
00:28:10,373 --> 00:28:17,070
Scott: Yeah, you don't have to put an AVI Codex which is basically nothing because it's not compressed or decompressed at all.

414
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:21,243
Scott: It's completely uncompressed video in an AVI container.

415
00:28:21,303 --> 00:28:26,418
Scott: You can put other videos in an AVI container And that are compressed in different ways.

416
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:26,819
Rym: Yep.

417
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:28,585
Rym: I mean the first big one.

418
00:28:28,605 --> 00:28:29,890
Rym: Well, there's also MPEG and all that.

419
00:28:29,971 --> 00:28:31,190
Rym: We'll talk about that in the video day.

420
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:36,370
Rym: Yeah Divx was the one that really got this sort of thing big and that was the first one.

421
00:28:36,812 --> 00:28:40,750
Rym: That was really the first time where people actually had to do something to play a video file.

422
00:28:41,392 --> 00:28:46,050
Scott: Yeah, I mean before divx the only codex you really had in containers were.

423
00:28:47,271 --> 00:28:50,199
Scott: There was the AVI which was for micro.

424
00:28:50,219 --> 00:28:50,641
Scott: was it all?

425
00:28:50,681 --> 00:29:02,069
Scott: Microsoft stuff was AVI and it was completely uncompressed video MOV which was QuickTime and it was all the Apple stuff which barely worked If at all on PCs for a long time.

426
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:08,829
Scott: There was the real stuff which is a real container which contained compressed real video and real audio.

427
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:12,259
Scott: and There was MPEG - which is what's on DVDs.

428
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,704
Rym: Well, there was also MPEG.

429
00:29:14,005 --> 00:29:15,790
Rym: There's also the MPEG is complicated.

430
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:21,310
Rym: We'll talk about that in great detail because there are a bunch of different layers of MPEG and different types of MPEG and different.

431
00:29:22,692 --> 00:29:23,817
Rym: We can't get into it today.

432
00:29:23,937 --> 00:29:24,882
Scott: Yeah, we're gonna do that.

433
00:29:24,922 --> 00:29:29,866
Scott: The third show is video but The fourth show I guess is the first show MPEG.

434
00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:33,502
Scott: Yes So these are all the containers that there were.

435
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:48,330
Scott: and then all of a sudden someone said hey We're gonna make this new way to compress video that actually can make a really high quality video one That would normally take up gigs fit inside a hue a few hundred megs without losing significant quality.

436
00:29:48,631 --> 00:29:49,575
Scott: That was crazy.

437
00:29:49,957 --> 00:29:50,700
Scott: It was crazy.

438
00:29:50,941 --> 00:29:51,965
Scott: Absolutely insane.

439
00:29:51,985 --> 00:29:53,050
Rym: I mean the same with music.

440
00:29:53,391 --> 00:30:01,112
Rym: I mean I used to collect MIDI files and then like I had a couple of wave files of music and they were huge and my I was tiny.

441
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:11,946
Rym: and then the day when I found mp3s and I downloaded Half of this live recording of Hotel, California and I started playing it and it was.

442
00:30:12,508 --> 00:30:15,376
Rym: it was real music But it was like three megabytes.

443
00:30:15,797 --> 00:30:16,038
Rym: Yep.

444
00:30:16,579 --> 00:30:17,081
Scott: It's insane.

445
00:30:17,121 --> 00:30:20,030
Rym: an equivalent wave file would have been like 30 megabytes.

446
00:30:20,712 --> 00:30:26,755
Scott: Yep, I guess we should now talk about the difference between lossy and lossless because it's something a lot of people understand But not everyone.

447
00:30:26,815 --> 00:30:29,290
Rym: it also applies to all three of the topics.

448
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:38,550
Scott: Yes, now when someone says lossy and lossless compression They mean that you can make it smaller without losing data.

449
00:30:38,812 --> 00:30:41,670
Scott: You see an AVI file is not missing any data.

450
00:30:41,831 --> 00:30:51,150
Scott: If I take a video of Rym with a video camera and I take the AVI file out of that camera It is pretty much in that AVI file exactly what I saw in the eye hole.

451
00:30:51,692 --> 00:30:54,199
Scott: It's it's the best quality that the camera could record.

452
00:30:54,621 --> 00:31:03,950
Scott: every single bit of information is in there, you know If I compress it to make it smaller with say Divx, it will get much smaller.

453
00:31:04,271 --> 00:31:12,114
Scott: However, if you watch both videos side-by-side you would say hey that Divx one is doesn't look as good It's missing some information.

454
00:31:12,315 --> 00:31:26,430
Rym: It still looks good maybe but then again you might not because even if something is lossy It doesn't mean you can tell the difference because a lot of times what a lossy compression will do is remove Redundant data or data that your eye couldn't pick up anyway.

455
00:31:26,812 --> 00:31:36,845
Scott: Yeah, like an mp3 is lossy You are losing audio information when you turn a wave into an mp3 But you might not be able to detect that information with your ear.

456
00:31:36,906 --> 00:31:46,150
Rym: the stuff that it took out in fact the math behind MP3 originally was simply that there are obviously sounds that are in music that the human ear cannot detect.

457
00:31:46,611 --> 00:31:54,331
Rym: Therefore let's try to figure out a way to remove all the things that you can't hear and only leave in the things you can Hear.

458
00:31:54,392 --> 00:31:56,987
Rym: that way it doesn't take as much data to describe the sound.

459
00:31:57,228 --> 00:31:57,409
Rym: Yep.

460
00:31:58,232 --> 00:32:06,192
Scott: So when someone says something is a lossy, that means that when you are compressing it you're removing Information.

461
00:32:06,232 --> 00:32:10,950
Scott: there is less information in the compressed file than there is in the non compressed file.

462
00:32:11,131 --> 00:32:20,830
Rym: Yep, the information may or may not actually matter But if you compress things over and over or change from one lossy to another you keep losing more data every time you do.

463
00:32:21,031 --> 00:32:25,710
Scott: If you make something into an mp3 then an AAC then you turn that into.

464
00:32:26,412 --> 00:32:31,710
Scott: I don't know what you can turn it into after that some other crazy audio file then back into an mp3 again.

465
00:32:32,191 --> 00:32:34,458
Scott: You're losing more information each time.

466
00:32:34,478 --> 00:32:37,186
Scott: It's sort of like recording from one VCR to another.

467
00:32:37,226 --> 00:32:38,670
Scott: it just gets crappier and crappier.

468
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,267
Rym: Yeah, granted it tends to level off.

469
00:32:40,711 --> 00:32:41,754
Rym: I mean don't worry about this.

470
00:32:41,814 --> 00:32:48,229
Rym: mostly because the way the algorithms work is pretty smart and they realize hey I can't take any more data out of this.

471
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:52,090
Rym: But even then you'll get some artifacting and trouble depending on exactly what you're doing.

472
00:32:52,431 --> 00:32:58,326
Scott: Yeah, but if something is lossless it is possible to make something smaller without losing any data.

473
00:32:58,547 --> 00:33:08,340
Rym: now lossless Applies mostly to non media files because I mean say I've got a program that I've written, you know It's a bunch of instructions for the computer in a lane like assembler.

474
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,688
Scott: if one of those instructions is lost.

475
00:33:10,728 --> 00:33:11,370
Scott: It's game over.

476
00:33:11,511 --> 00:33:14,970
Rym: Yeah, if anything has changed at all, then it won't work.

477
00:33:15,331 --> 00:33:19,470
Rym: So I can only use lossless compression where nothing is actually lost.

478
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:24,510
Rym: It just uses algorithms to figure out how to express what it was smaller.

479
00:33:24,891 --> 00:33:27,501
Scott: Like if I sent an email to Rym, you know, I could.

480
00:33:27,682 --> 00:33:29,087
Scott: maybe it's a big long email.

481
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:29,528
Scott: It's 100 megabytes.

482
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,976
Scott: I need to shrink it to 500 megabytes.

483
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:33,220
Scott: I can do.

484
00:33:34,062 --> 00:33:35,005
Scott: I know I'm making it up.

485
00:33:35,045 --> 00:33:36,389
Scott: It's crazy numbers for an email.

486
00:33:36,429 --> 00:33:38,562
Rym: No Check your math there.

487
00:33:38,582 --> 00:33:43,229
Scott: Oh Yeah, I need to drink it to 50 megabytes.

488
00:33:44,911 --> 00:33:46,195
Scott: Yeah, it's a crazy email.

489
00:33:46,215 --> 00:33:49,605
Scott: I need to cut it in half, right so I will do.

490
00:33:49,765 --> 00:33:53,558
Scott: if I did a lossy compression I would shrink it to 50 megabytes.

491
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,622
Scott: Rym would get it.

492
00:33:54,802 --> 00:33:56,749
Scott: He'd open it up and half the email will be missing.

493
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:59,409
Scott: So that wouldn't really work out.

494
00:33:59,791 --> 00:34:02,618
Scott: You have to do a lossless compression like a zip file.

495
00:34:03,099 --> 00:34:10,960
Scott: a zip file will shrink another file inside of a zip and It won't lose anything when you unzip it and uncompress it.

496
00:34:11,042 --> 00:34:12,688
Scott: the whole files there just like before.

497
00:34:13,029 --> 00:34:16,389
Scott: Yep But it takes up less space and there are a lot of lossless formats.

498
00:34:16,511 --> 00:34:21,050
Rym: I mean flack is probably the most commonly known lossless audio format.

499
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:23,650
Rym: It's not used that widely but we use it on GeekNights.

500
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:29,808
Scott: Yeah I mean if you take a wave you take a CD and you rip the audio off the CD to a wave.

501
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:30,911
Scott: you haven't lost Anything.

502
00:34:30,931 --> 00:34:32,456
Scott: this perfect PCM audio.

503
00:34:32,799 --> 00:34:34,384
Scott: that wave is the same as the CD.

504
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:35,790
Scott: turn it into a flack.

505
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:40,385
Scott: You're gonna cut the size by quite a bit, but you're not gonna lose a single sound.

506
00:34:40,446 --> 00:34:41,630
Scott: It'll sound just the same as CD.

507
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:44,076
Scott: Turn it into an mp3.

508
00:34:44,136 --> 00:34:49,688
Scott: However, and it's not gonna sound the same as the CD But you might not be able to detect that with your ear.

509
00:34:50,205 --> 00:35:03,269
Rym: Yeah I mean if you can encode mp3s, you know with like 320 kbps where it's used It has so much data of stream available That really no human can actually tell the difference at that point and people who say they can't are lying to you.

510
00:35:03,732 --> 00:35:11,230
Scott: But if you encode the mp3 to say 96 kbps You can clearly tell the difference that something is missing and it will not sound as good as the CD.

511
00:35:11,671 --> 00:35:13,898
Rym: yeah, you want to see a really good example of it.

512
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:22,308
Rym: quick open a program like the GIMP or Photoshop and take an image and Then try to save it as a JPEG and usually you can pick the quality level you want.

513
00:35:22,388 --> 00:35:24,113
Rym: on the JPEG It'll show you the file size.

514
00:35:24,474 --> 00:35:32,930
Rym: It'll show you a preview of what the picture will look like and As you drag it to smaller file sizes, you can see the artifacts start appearing and the image looks worse and worse and worse.

515
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:39,211
Scott: Yes, JPEG GIF pang all of those are Lossy image compression format.

516
00:35:39,252 --> 00:35:40,379
Rym: Scott GIF is lossless.

517
00:35:42,261 --> 00:35:43,265
Scott: Well, it's not.

518
00:35:43,325 --> 00:35:50,250
Scott: if you turn like a big bitmap into a gif gif has a limited palette So it can only give as a format is lossless.

519
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:52,136
Rym: If you put something in the gift format.

520
00:35:52,457 --> 00:35:53,179
Rym: It is a perfect.

521
00:35:54,383 --> 00:36:01,268
Scott: If you take another if you take an image that the get a gif file format cannot handle Yeah, gif is only lossly lossy.

522
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:06,253
Rym: If you try to put something into it that couldn't fit into it already Yeah, it only handles like 256 colors or whatever like that.

523
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,506
Rym: Yeah, well think of it this way.

524
00:36:08,607 --> 00:36:16,520
Rym: if you have a file that has 3,000 colors in it and you want to compress it one way to compress it is to reduce the number of colors.

525
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,248
Rym: That way you need less information to describe that picture.

526
00:36:19,669 --> 00:36:27,272
Rym: So if you turn it into a gif with only 255 colors It's not gonna look the same, but it'll be smaller.

527
00:36:27,553 --> 00:36:29,280
Scott: Yes much much much smaller.

528
00:36:29,883 --> 00:36:35,384
Scott: But if you turn into a JPEG you can keep all the colors you want But you're gonna lose Pixels here and there.

529
00:36:35,404 --> 00:36:40,980
Scott: it combines pixels together and mushes them into colors and it all and I'll describe more how it works next Monday.

530
00:36:41,121 --> 00:36:45,740
Rym: Yeah, it's all this cool stuff with mathematical equations and you might have heard the term wavelets before.

531
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,971
Scott: Yeah, it gets pretty cool that.

532
00:36:48,112 --> 00:36:49,860
Scott: that's all the stuff for the next three episodes.

533
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,381
Rym: Yeah, cuz.

534
00:36:50,402 --> 00:36:53,350
Rym: then there's the frontiers of all this which is fractal compression.

535
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:56,980
Scott: Yeah, how this compression actually happens is really freaking interesting.

536
00:36:57,502 --> 00:37:20,900
Scott: like you try to figure it out on your own like go home and try to like make a way to Write some words and then try to figure out a way to put the same information that is in those words to write the same sentence with fewer letters without you know Losing any of the information so that someone else can undo it and get the same thing back.

537
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,157
Scott: You know make up like a secret code that shrinks things down and works for any sentence.

538
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:27,100
Scott: You can come up with it.

539
00:37:27,264 --> 00:37:27,778
Scott: It's pretty cool.

540
00:37:28,001 --> 00:37:35,551
Rym: Yeah, the thing is it's a lot easier to do that than to do it for a computer because if another human is reading It humans are smart and can figure things out.

541
00:37:35,651 --> 00:37:37,720
Rym: computers can't actually figure things out.

542
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,105
Rym: They have to follow a process.

543
00:37:39,506 --> 00:37:43,240
Scott: You have to be able to do it so that there's no actual figuring out involved.

544
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:49,500
Scott: It has to be a process where you know, you perform these steps in this order exactly to you know.

545
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,119
Scott: Take some information shrink it and make it big again without losing anything.

546
00:37:53,885 --> 00:38:10,113
Rym: So in the very least for the next three or four weeks We're going to be going into great detail about video audio and image codex decoders coders containers players Etc compressing decompressing playing watching listening.

547
00:38:10,314 --> 00:38:16,340
Rym: if you have any specific questions about this Are there any things you want us to cover directly post in the forums?

548
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:16,942
Rym: Let us know.

549
00:38:17,042 --> 00:38:21,199
Rym: we'll probably be able to talk about it because we'll actually have some time to think about it.

550
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:26,180
Scott: Yeah, and just to head off, you know the how do I get all these videos to play?

551
00:38:27,523 --> 00:38:28,650
Scott: There is a most.

552
00:38:28,731 --> 00:38:30,020
Scott: you are probably using Windows.

553
00:38:30,401 --> 00:38:35,100
Scott: There is a thing called the combined community codec pack aka the USSR.

554
00:38:35,803 --> 00:38:42,328
Scott: Yes, the cccp and if you go to cccp - project net Supposedly, I haven't tried it because I run Linux.

555
00:38:42,890 --> 00:39:02,617
Scott: this will help you play all your videos Specifically your anime fan subs that you downloaded legally or semi legally Animas key and that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

556
00:39:02,657 --> 00:39:04,680
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for our opening theme.

557
00:39:05,144 --> 00:39:09,548
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontrowcrew.com.

558
00:39:10,191 --> 00:39:12,560
Scott: if you like our podcast, you'll love our forums.

559
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,484
Scott: Make sure you visit them.

560
00:39:14,046 --> 00:39:20,348
Scott: You can send your email feedback to GeekNights at gmail.com And if you want you can leave us a voicemail at two.

561
00:39:20,428 --> 00:39:24,259
Scott: Oh six three three three one five three seven.

562
00:39:24,842 --> 00:39:27,380
Rym: GeekNights airs every weeknight Monday through Thursday.

563
00:39:28,261 --> 00:39:33,756
Scott: GeekNights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience, but unlike those other talk shows.

564
00:39:34,157 --> 00:39:35,400
Scott: It's actually recorded at night.
