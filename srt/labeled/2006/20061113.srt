00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,549
Rym: It's Monday November 13th.

2
00:00:12,111 --> 00:00:14,480
Rym: I'm Rym and I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:24,859
Rym: tonight we continue our series on how computers work with a new set of episodes on Hard drives and storage beginning with how to partition your hard drives.

4
00:00:26,262 --> 00:00:34,955
Rym: Let's do this You know for the last several weeks every weekend We go out and then we come back and we do this show and we say something like man.

5
00:00:35,036 --> 00:00:39,491
Scott: What a crazy weekend You know, well, I always say why can't we do nothing next weekend?

6
00:00:39,651 --> 00:00:43,124
Rym: And you know what we did this past weekend almost nothing Really?

7
00:00:43,204 --> 00:00:43,526
Rym: Nothing.

8
00:00:43,566 --> 00:00:45,336
Rym: I mean Emily and Alex came over.

9
00:00:45,356 --> 00:00:49,269
Rym: we Played some video games and some board games.

10
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,180
Scott: I put a lot of Resident Evil 4. zombies roll up in the hell, right?

11
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,325
Rym: Hey, it's on fire.

12
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:55,356
Scott: You know, I haven't seen an axe on fire.

13
00:00:55,416 --> 00:01:03,115
Rym: the whole time We watched some Harold and Kumar go to White Castle Which was 50% a good movie and 50% not so much a good movie.

14
00:01:03,376 --> 00:01:04,260
Scott: It was a stoner movie.

15
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:06,307
Rym: Yeah, we'll probably talk about that someday.

16
00:01:06,347 --> 00:01:07,852
Rym: But it was the first half was really funny.

17
00:01:08,113 --> 00:01:09,558
Scott: Yeah, kinda wasn't bad.

18
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:12,377
Rym: Yeah Scott and I played a lot of Dig Dug.

19
00:01:12,397 --> 00:01:13,882
Scott: Oh Dig Dug.

20
00:01:14,604 --> 00:01:15,668
Rym: we played some Puerto Rico.

21
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,756
Scott: I was what didn't I do that?

22
00:01:17,776 --> 00:01:18,820
Scott: I wanted to do laundry.

23
00:01:19,941 --> 00:01:20,965
Rym: Yeah, I didn't do laundry.

24
00:01:21,045 --> 00:01:22,210
Scott: I clean my room.

25
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,234
Rym: I didn't clean my room.

26
00:01:23,856 --> 00:01:26,594
Rym: clean the bathroom Yeah, you need to do that.

27
00:01:26,614 --> 00:01:32,617
Scott: Yeah Meanwhile, I've cleaned the bathroom more times than you ever cleaned it the bathrooms filthier than it's ever been.

28
00:01:32,698 --> 00:01:33,340
Scott: Oh, it's not.

29
00:01:34,843 --> 00:01:35,867
Scott: Yes, it is.

30
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:45,420
Rym: You can't clean ten bathrooms, whatever Whatever and of course, we're not going to have it anytime in the nearest near future.

31
00:01:45,922 --> 00:01:50,359
Rym: But coming with you know, the beginning of season two, we're working on a season one DVD.

32
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,486
Scott: Yeah, among other things.

33
00:01:52,727 --> 00:01:54,292
Scott: I'm probably gonna build up.

34
00:01:54,312 --> 00:01:55,536
Scott: we're gonna get swag.

35
00:01:55,657 --> 00:02:00,340
Scott: We're gonna get the DVDs We're gonna get the promo CDs and a new website and everything.

36
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:05,880
Scott: We're gonna pile it all up in a buffer and then we're gonna release it all at once in a giant GeekNights orgasm.

37
00:02:06,261 --> 00:02:07,305
Rym: It's gonna be crazy.

38
00:02:07,485 --> 00:02:18,080
Rym: Yeah, so watch out for that in some months probably next year early next year Yep, and also all this week because we haven't done it in a while other than you know making jokes about other podcasts.

39
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:22,020
Rym: But I'm gonna be playing promos all week because there are a lot of good podcasts out there that I listen to now.

40
00:02:22,502 --> 00:02:31,911
Rym: Yeah, now that I've weeded the chaff from the weed missile Yeah Yeah, yeah, all right, so what do we got in the news?

41
00:02:31,971 --> 00:02:32,734
Rym: we'll get right to it.

42
00:02:33,175 --> 00:02:34,340
Rym: we didn't do much this weekend.

43
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:36,320
Scott: No, we didn't apparently Java.

44
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:43,575
Scott: Well people have been rumouring this for a long time But Sun finally took Java and they made it open source.

45
00:02:43,635 --> 00:02:53,726
Scott: Not only did they make it open source They put it out under the GPL as opposed to one of those other licenses that Sun usually uses like the C Whatever whatever.

46
00:02:54,067 --> 00:02:56,560
Rym: you might not care, but this is kind of a big deal.

47
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:58,679
Scott: This is a pretty giant deal.

48
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,261
Rym: I mean this.

49
00:02:59,843 --> 00:03:11,660
Rym: this has implications to the point that work I did at previous employers is now no longer Necessary because it has been replaced by the fact that you don't have to work around this Java stuff anymore.

50
00:03:11,961 --> 00:03:15,650
Scott: Yep, see Sun is a company that's been around for a long time.

51
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,653
Scott: And what does Sun make?

52
00:03:16,713 --> 00:03:31,499
Scott: they make Java and they make servers and they make Solaris, which is an operator a Unix operating system and They recently took Solaris and made open Solaris because Solaris is not Linux it is Unix it it.

53
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:44,860
Scott: you know it might seem the same to if you don't know what the hell you're doing, but no it is very different and You know It was everyone who bought Sun machines for their big company server farms was using Solaris and you know is important.

54
00:03:45,423 --> 00:03:48,379
Scott: But they put out open Solaris, which wasn't GPL.

55
00:03:48,786 --> 00:03:50,102
Scott: It was you know Open.

56
00:03:50,162 --> 00:03:54,194
Scott: you could get Solaris for kind of free kind of and it wasn't.

57
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:57,184
Scott: you couldn't just take all the source code and do whatever You wanted and whatever.

58
00:03:57,947 --> 00:04:01,660
Scott: and for a long time people have been saying why don't they open source Java?

59
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:11,289
Scott: Hey and all those people who are the Linux crazies the people who refuse to use anything if it's not a hundred percent free Wouldn't use Sun Java.

60
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:14,420
Scott: That's why you would download Linux and it wouldn't come with Java installed.

61
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,000
Scott: You'd have to go out, you know and get Java and usually you wouldn't get the real Java.

62
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:24,040
Scott: You would get something like cafe or black down JRE or something like that.

63
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:38,700
Rym: Yeah That was a big deal at IBM because among other things we weren't allowed to use Actual Sun Java because as a developer some of the things in Sun's licenses from before Would in IBM's eyes kind of taint you to where if you worked on IBM stuff.

64
00:04:39,586 --> 00:04:41,579
Rym: They were worried that Sun can make claims against it.

65
00:04:42,121 --> 00:04:48,480
Rym: So they really had kind of this quarantine and I had to implement a lot of things using black down instead of using real Java.

66
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:56,852
Scott: Yeah, now when you think of Java, you might just be thinking of applets in the web browser because that's you know Most of the way normal people see Java is.

67
00:04:56,872 --> 00:04:58,760
Scott: they just see Java applets and web browsers.

68
00:04:59,202 --> 00:05:03,985
Scott: Java is a lot of places that you don't see it Like you go to your bank's website.

69
00:05:04,626 --> 00:05:09,740
Scott: is I say a 90% chance that bank's website is actually Java running on a server somewhere?

70
00:05:09,901 --> 00:05:11,374
Rym: I know a lot of you use a serious.

71
00:05:11,818 --> 00:05:13,879
Rym: Yes That's all Java.

72
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,289
Scott: Um Your cell phone all those games on your cell phone.

73
00:05:18,489 --> 00:05:22,640
Scott: Those are all Java pretty much unless you have a Windows mobile phone.

74
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,709
Rym: Yeah, in which case they're just Windows program.

75
00:05:24,749 --> 00:05:25,854
Scott: Well, they might also be.

76
00:05:25,894 --> 00:05:35,700
Rym: there's sometimes Java but Yeah, Java is freaking everywhere and it's super important now in addition to you know being awesome because this really opens up Java.

77
00:05:35,941 --> 00:05:40,320
Rym: You know Java can just come with Linux distros now Mm-hmm and all sorts of fun things.

78
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:46,402
Rym: But also now if Sun does well with this which I'm sure they will they're generating a lot of good Press.

79
00:05:46,442 --> 00:05:47,912
Rym: a lot of people are just gonna use Java.

80
00:05:47,952 --> 00:05:49,240
Rym: Java is gonna have a better reputation.

81
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:51,205
Rym: Maybe other companies will see that.

82
00:05:51,245 --> 00:05:56,540
Rym: Hey, you know what open sourcing something like that can only be good for our company.

83
00:05:57,084 --> 00:05:59,400
Scott: Well, I think the point of it is is Java is really old.

84
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:04,975
Scott: It's like 10 plus years old and it's gotten to a point where people are not so interested anymore.

85
00:06:05,035 --> 00:06:12,520
Scott: big enterprise people who are already Using Java are gonna continue using Java but new people aren't too into it.

86
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:23,780
Scott: Yeah, someone who's starting something new isn't likely to choose Java, you know, even though a lot of people out there know it It's they're better choices that are more specific to your task.

87
00:06:23,921 --> 00:06:27,140
Scott: Java is sort of like this big clunky do-it-all type of thing.

88
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:29,625
Rym: I mean Java is one of the few programming language.

89
00:06:29,726 --> 00:06:32,271
Rym: I actually learned it all and I hated it.

90
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:40,060
Rym: I Really especially gooey stuff which is really kind of not what I wanted.

91
00:06:40,221 --> 00:06:44,180
Scott: The other thing about Java is that it's not really making Sun money anymore.

92
00:06:44,401 --> 00:06:58,160
Scott: the people making money off of Java are companies like IBM, IBM with their web sphere and There's open source programs like Tomcat on Apache where you don't need Sun and all kinds of stuff like that.

93
00:06:58,381 --> 00:07:01,353
Scott: Yeah, so they weren't making money off of it, but they owned it.

94
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,605
Rym: So they're not losing anything Monetarily by opening it.

95
00:07:04,986 --> 00:07:06,149
Rym: all they're doing is gaining.

96
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,760
Rym: one industry standard disk is now for that sort of thing.

97
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:13,679
Rym: No one has any argument for using non-standard Java at all.

98
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:19,800
Rym: Mm-hmm and to a whole bunch of good press the Linux community is lauding them for being awesome.

99
00:07:20,502 --> 00:07:25,055
Scott: Not only that, but I think now that it's open source and it's not you know, this weird thing.

100
00:07:25,617 --> 00:07:34,309
Scott: You're gonna see Java included in a lot of places that before it was not included and therefore More people are gonna write in Java.

101
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:37,040
Scott: It'll probably get more popular before you know.

102
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,605
Scott: instead it is basically.

103
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:52,916
Scott: Java was on a downhill slope and by open sourcing it and allowing it to Propagate itself to wherever and also allowing open source people to improve Java and make it more awesome Because Sun hasn't really been doing anything to make it more awesome besides giving away for free.

104
00:07:53,117 --> 00:08:02,490
Scott: Yeah You're gonna start seeing it show up in a lot more places and having Java skills is gonna be a lot more important and There's gonna be a lot of awesome stuff made in Java.

105
00:08:02,932 --> 00:08:03,213
Rym: Yeah.

106
00:08:03,534 --> 00:08:04,940
Scott: Yeah, it's gonna be all good.

107
00:08:05,081 --> 00:08:06,474
Scott: There's gonna be crazy shit happening.

108
00:08:06,494 --> 00:08:06,817
Scott: Watch out.

109
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:13,078
Rym: So speaking of coding and programming and all that and actually this time my segue is kind of relevant.

110
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,484
Rym: now There's been a lot of talk about Voting machines and how they're.

111
00:08:16,725 --> 00:08:20,997
Rym: the new electronic ones are kind of either evil or poorly written or something.

112
00:08:21,037 --> 00:08:22,040
Scott: pretty sure they're just poor.

113
00:08:22,447 --> 00:08:22,916
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

114
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:30,920
Rym: Well in one of the recent elections a guy ran for mayor in a town that has 80 people in it.

115
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,933
Scott: That's a small town 80.

116
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:34,924
Scott: I thought it was a town 100 people.

117
00:08:35,225 --> 00:08:36,227
Scott: only 80 people voted.

118
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:38,235
Rym: No, the town has 80 people in it.

119
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:45,398
Rym: Okay, according to this article Okay, quote Randy Wooten figured he'd get at least one vote in his bid for mayor in this town of 80 people.

120
00:08:46,503 --> 00:08:49,483
Rym: Okay, so he voted for himself Obviously.

121
00:08:49,503 --> 00:08:52,517
Rym: and then you know the election is over and he lost.

122
00:08:52,537 --> 00:08:53,280
Rym: he expected to lose.

123
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,918
Rym: He had no illusion that he was going to win.

124
00:08:55,622 --> 00:09:00,178
Rym: the official count was that no one voted for him that his count was zero.

125
00:09:00,218 --> 00:09:02,927
Rym: now if Out of a town of 80 people.

126
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,840
Rym: I'm sure that not 80 people voted.

127
00:09:06,002 --> 00:09:07,559
Rym: So it's even less than 80 votes.

128
00:09:08,442 --> 00:09:14,780
Rym: If a vote goes missing in a sample that small something is fucking wrong with your voting system.

129
00:09:15,225 --> 00:09:16,418
Rym: That can't happen.

130
00:09:17,062 --> 00:09:17,846
Scott: Well, it could.

131
00:09:17,987 --> 00:09:25,160
Rym: if your voting machine is a shitty ass electronic voting You know how broken it would have to be for one just a number to not get count.

132
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:38,809
Scott: That could be like not even cs1 like an elementary school elementary school programming class a middle school kid you could teach him like The bare basics after I got bad eggs cue basic.

133
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,578
Scott: after yeah in basic you could write a program that could count 80 votes.

134
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,510
Scott: Easily, yeah with no problems whatsoever.

135
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:51,336
Scott: a middle school guy would write a bulletproof Vote counting program in basic.

136
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:58,100
Rym: now The best part is he says that from people he's talked to in town at least eight or nine people claim to have voted for him.

137
00:09:58,261 --> 00:09:59,550
Rym: So it's not just as one vote.

138
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:05,960
Rym: maybe I mean It's hard to say because one of the tenants of American democracy is that votes are secret.

139
00:10:06,362 --> 00:10:09,659
Rym: So you can say you voted for whoever but you have no way to prove it.

140
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:14,680
Rym: So there is a tiny chance that everyone involved is just lying.

141
00:10:15,126 --> 00:10:16,219
Scott: That's what I was gonna say.

142
00:10:16,562 --> 00:10:30,460
Scott: It could be that these people are just so smart that they want to you know Really nail this bullshit about the electronic voting machines that suck that they all voted One guy and they said they voted something else just to get the machines inspected and to start a fear.

143
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,570
Rym: The thing is I I don't know.

144
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,077
Rym: I give that maybe a 5% chance.

145
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,168
Scott: Yeah, I don't give it a strong chance.

146
00:10:36,229 --> 00:10:38,200
Scott: and just pointing out the interesting possibility

147
00:10:38,361 --> 00:10:58,529
Rym: yeah, but really this this really shakes my faith in American democracy a little bit because While I may disagree with people who get elected I think that the process of elections and the process of democracy is more important than the result in a lot of cases because at least if the democracy works people have a chance to change things.

148
00:10:58,549 --> 00:11:06,121
Rym: if Something happens and the Pete no one was involved other than a programmer who didn't pass CS 101.

149
00:11:06,121 --> 00:11:08,520
Rym: Yep, that's not cool at all.

150
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:10,303
Scott: I mean It's one thing.

151
00:11:10,464 --> 00:11:17,707
Scott: if your vote if you yell about your vote not counting because it counts so little like if you live in California your vote barely matters.

152
00:11:18,148 --> 00:11:21,700
Scott: and if you live in Wyoming your vote matters a lot more at least in a presidential race.

153
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,133
Scott: Yep, but it's another thing entirely to say my vote really doesn't matter.

154
00:11:26,574 --> 00:11:32,151
Scott: It's all up to some computer program That UFO hovering over your house getting annoying.

155
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:34,300
Rym: the impending apocalypse got you down.

156
00:11:34,743 --> 00:11:36,759
Rym: Did your horoscope tell you it's your unlucky day?

157
00:11:37,161 --> 00:11:41,179
Rym: Well, don't worry skepticality is here to remind you that sanity is only a mouse click away.

158
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:48,582
Rym: skeptical discussion rational thought and odd, but interesting news all here at Www.skepticality.com.

159
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:58,230
Rym: truth in podcasting things of the day.

160
00:12:00,614 --> 00:12:03,710
Scott: So at first I watched this thing of the day and I said to myself.

161
00:12:04,092 --> 00:12:07,870
Scott: The same thing that Rym said when he saw the thing of the day was that you can't do that.

162
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:11,830
Rym: Yeah, cuz I made the same error that Scott made when watching it.

163
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:16,024
Scott: Yeah, but then I watched it again and I realized you you definitely can do that.

164
00:12:16,586 --> 00:12:17,630
Scott: some guys their bump.

165
00:12:17,831 --> 00:12:19,298
Scott: It's a professional soccer game.

166
00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:21,749
Scott: Someone kicks the ball really high in the air.

167
00:12:22,251 --> 00:12:23,495
Scott: It goes near the goalie.

168
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:27,748
Scott: the goalie runs way away from the goal jumps up in the air and catches the ball.

169
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,013
Scott: because he's a goalie He can do that.

170
00:12:29,475 --> 00:12:33,718
Scott: He does like a flip in the air and he lands and he's on his feet, you know He's standing there.

171
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:34,910
Scott: He's looking out at the field.

172
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:39,525
Scott: He's got the ball in his hands as a guy from the other team behind the goalie.

173
00:12:39,585 --> 00:12:41,150
Scott: now play has not stopped.

174
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,137
Scott: This is this is play, you know, they're.

175
00:12:43,318 --> 00:12:44,462
Scott: the game is in motion.

176
00:12:44,923 --> 00:12:46,469
Scott: Everything is cool right now.

177
00:12:46,991 --> 00:12:48,340
Scott: You know people could do whatever they want.

178
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,970
Scott: It's uh, it's just a game of soccer.

179
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,820
Scott: It's not like a throw in or anything like that.

180
00:12:53,141 --> 00:12:54,406
Rym: See I wasn't paying attention.

181
00:12:54,466 --> 00:12:59,750
Rym: So it's not a goal kick Yeah, but when I watched it, I just wasn't paying attention and it looked like a throw in because I wasn't watching.

182
00:12:59,931 --> 00:13:00,453
Scott: Yeah, you got.

183
00:13:00,695 --> 00:13:02,182
Scott: it's not a throw in or a goal kick.

184
00:13:02,242 --> 00:13:08,810
Scott: It's the goalie caught the ball and He's standing there holding the ball and someone from the other team is standing behind him and the goal.

185
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,187
Scott: He's far away from the goal.

186
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:19,730
Scott: now He could have run back over to the goal with the ball But instead of doing that he puts it on the ground Like and then he's you know He's gonna size it up and then kick it all the way down the field.

187
00:13:20,273 --> 00:13:27,349
Scott: The guy on the other team who is hiding behind the goalie runs up in front of the goalie and kicks the ball into the wide open goal.

188
00:13:27,369 --> 00:13:33,550
Rym: and I can just imagine what's going through that goaltender's head because that's the kind of thing that happens in a cheesy soccer movie.

189
00:13:34,192 --> 00:13:36,282
Scott: Yeah, it's like or football.

190
00:13:36,342 --> 00:13:38,070
Rym: to the majority of our listeners.

191
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:42,087
Scott: It's like the old Statue of Liberty play or something like that actually working.

192
00:13:42,268 --> 00:13:43,793
Scott: Yeah It's like.

193
00:13:44,014 --> 00:13:47,044
Scott: it's like you watch a game a little league baseball and you'll never.

194
00:13:47,064 --> 00:13:48,750
Scott: you'll never see this in the major leagues.

195
00:13:49,151 --> 00:13:59,609
Scott: but in little league baseball when someone gets walked they will always run to first base and Because there's you're perfectly allowed to continue to running to second base after a walk.

196
00:14:00,654 --> 00:14:01,601
Scott: Just no one ever does.

197
00:14:01,621 --> 00:14:03,090
Rym: yeah, it's the same as stealing a base.

198
00:14:03,112 --> 00:14:09,470
Scott: Yes so in little league Kids will run to first base as always as fast as they can even if they got a walk.

199
00:14:09,711 --> 00:14:12,910
Scott: They won't just walk, you know, just because then they might steal second.

200
00:14:12,971 --> 00:14:13,498
Scott: It's like a trick.

201
00:14:13,945 --> 00:14:20,252
Rym: see now I got to say I'd be a lot more interested in Major League Baseball if people still tried to pull shenanigans like that all the Time.

202
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:23,070
Scott: I'd be a lot worse than any sport if people actually tried to pull shenanigans.

203
00:14:23,251 --> 00:14:36,099
Scott: the problem is every shenanigan has been pulled and Nowadays Since everyone has such a high level of athletic ability in professional sports shenanigans don't work because athletic ability beats shenanigans.

204
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:41,536
Rym: if a guy runs to first no matter how fast he is after a walk if he Turns and tries to go to second.

205
00:14:41,817 --> 00:14:44,807
Rym: There's no way he'll get there before they throw the ball to second base.

206
00:14:45,088 --> 00:14:50,556
Scott: Yep Pull a little league kid, but you can't fool, you know, yeah It's too bad really.

207
00:14:50,576 --> 00:14:52,725
Scott: yeah, it's like, you know what would bring baseball back.

208
00:14:52,745 --> 00:14:53,649
Scott: That's another reason.

209
00:14:53,729 --> 00:14:55,559
Scott: hockey You can't really pull shenanigans in hockey.

210
00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:57,590
Rym: The thing is hockey doesn't matter cuz hockey is awesome.

211
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:03,230
Rym: Anyway, I know but you know what would make baseball awesome if you set it up where if you were good they kicked you out.

212
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,310
Rym: Yeah Like you have to be missing at least four fingers to be able to play baseball.

213
00:15:09,891 --> 00:15:16,690
Rym: Anyway, all right, so when I found this like four days ago, it was awesome and it suddenly exploded around the internet.

214
00:15:16,811 --> 00:15:20,370
Rym: so if you've seen it before me, I Don't care.

215
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:27,549
Rym: But this is a little video that someone did for their master's thesis in animation and it's about a little Kiwi.

216
00:15:28,171 --> 00:15:30,422
Rym: I saw this now for those of you don't know what a Kiwi is.

217
00:15:30,502 --> 00:15:34,938
Rym: It's a small flightless bird That's really really cute with a long long beak.

218
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,282
Scott: It's a funny bird.

219
00:15:36,423 --> 00:15:37,566
Rym: It's a really awesome bird.

220
00:15:37,626 --> 00:15:38,790
Rym: I'd like to have a pet Kiwi.

221
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:39,673
Scott: No, not really.

222
00:15:39,714 --> 00:15:41,200
Rym: They're not that smart from what I get.

223
00:15:41,462 --> 00:15:43,210
Scott: They're not pleasant, but they they look cool.

224
00:15:43,551 --> 00:15:45,058
Rym: Well, I think they're cute whatever.

225
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,489
Rym: but yeah this video I don't want to ruin it.

226
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:58,746
Rym: You should figure out what's going on as you watch this video if you have any amount of intelligence and you'll figure it out at The end or you'll figure it out at the end end at some point.

227
00:15:58,967 --> 00:15:59,770
Rym: You'll figure it out.

228
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:06,550
Rym: It's a very cute charming video, but I'll warn you it's kind of sad, but it also says a lot.

229
00:16:06,691 --> 00:16:08,097
Rym: I think it's a very well done movie.

230
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:10,589
Scott: Yeah, I think there's not much more to say about.

231
00:16:10,609 --> 00:16:13,430
Rym: yeah I mean, I can't say what it means because that kind of ruins it.

232
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,781
Rym: But just watch it and you'll feel that feeling.

233
00:16:16,384 --> 00:16:20,200
Rym: and unless you're a cold-hearted Yeah, you have to be really cold-hearted tonight.

234
00:16:20,462 --> 00:16:22,390
Rym: Like if you get to the end of this you just start laughing.

235
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:24,018
Rym: Not a good, dude.

236
00:16:24,038 --> 00:16:26,408
Scott: I Think that should be the test.

237
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:31,568
Scott: It's like you just show someone the video and you're like, alright, is he Cartman?

238
00:16:33,852 --> 00:16:34,574
Rym: Or is he butters?

239
00:16:34,614 --> 00:16:35,798
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

240
00:16:35,818 --> 00:16:38,144
Scott: what does he say when he watches this video?

241
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,150
Scott: Ah good person Oh evil person.

242
00:16:40,752 --> 00:16:46,630
Scott: We just have every person in the world watch the video we do this video and execute the people in and the laughing test.

243
00:16:50,871 --> 00:16:54,455
Rym: All right I keep doing that all night.

244
00:16:54,957 --> 00:16:55,819
Scott: No, let's not.

245
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,381
Rym: Yeah.

246
00:16:56,401 --> 00:17:04,270
Rym: So tonight we in the vein of many things We've been doing with Mondays are going to go kind of back to our how computers work thing.

247
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:15,912
Rym: But we're gonna do a bunch of episodes about a kind of specific topic Which is hard drive partitioning formatting file systems all that jazz how to store data on Computers.

248
00:17:15,972 --> 00:17:30,430
Rym: because not only is there a lot of confusion about this and not only has it changed a lot in recent years But one of the most common sets of questions we get in our forums and in our email are either Help this file is locked and I can't unlock it or help.

249
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:34,003
Rym: I tried to install Linux and I deleted all my files or help.

250
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,508
Rym: I can't make a fifth partition.

251
00:17:35,568 --> 00:17:35,970
Rym: Why not?

252
00:17:36,371 --> 00:17:40,004
Scott: I think what it is really is if you're gonna even use.

253
00:17:40,104 --> 00:17:44,479
Scott: if you just buy a computer and use it Windows is already installed and you never have to know this stuff.

254
00:17:45,001 --> 00:17:54,223
Scott: if you're gonna tinker with your computer at all the first thing that usually comes up is that you need to learn about Partitioning and file systems and formatting and all that jazz.

255
00:17:54,264 --> 00:17:55,610
Scott: the first thing you have to learn.

256
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,759
Scott: It's the first thing that jumps into your face.

257
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:01,769
Scott: I mean if you install Windows on a computer Let's say you're just reinstalling Windows.

258
00:18:02,432 --> 00:18:12,610
Scott: The only thing you have to know about besides press enter press enter press enter is Stuff dealing with hard drives and partitioning and the question has come a lot up a lot lately.

259
00:18:13,052 --> 00:18:20,084
Scott: So we decided we're gonna do podcasts on it so that all you People who don't know what the hell's going on can hopefully be informed.

260
00:18:20,425 --> 00:18:20,566
Rym: now.

261
00:18:20,706 --> 00:18:23,476
Rym: one of the main Barriers that people have is that

262
00:18:23,998 --> 00:18:24,379
Scott: while

263
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:41,790
Rym: technology has advanced a lot in a lot of ways two things That for the vast majority of computers have not changed very much or very significantly are The way hard drives work and the way you interface with them on the low levels and the way the BIOS works.

264
00:18:42,471 --> 00:18:50,150
Rym: Yep, those two things are kind of archaic and they're really second nature to a lot of geeks in our generation.

265
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:59,256
Rym: doesn't mean Scott specifically just because we grew up in the era where computers had progressed beyond the Apple to kind of days and But they weren't easy yet.

266
00:18:59,537 --> 00:19:02,890
Rym: So we had to deal with all this stuff on a regular basis.

267
00:19:03,452 --> 00:19:09,870
Scott: Yeah, well a computer with a penny on one has significantly less features than a modern like I don't know quad core.

268
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:10,733
Scott: Whatever the fuck.

269
00:19:10,973 --> 00:19:11,616
Scott: but you had to do.

270
00:19:11,656 --> 00:19:16,190
Scott: BIOS is essentially the same max recently have done different things.

271
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,357
Scott: They have open firmware instead of BIOS.

272
00:19:18,538 --> 00:19:20,845
Scott: Yeah, and they have a different partitioning system.

273
00:19:20,885 --> 00:19:22,270
Scott: that it is just weird.

274
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,200
Rym: We're not talking about that.

275
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:24,030
Scott: We're not talking about that.

276
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,115
Scott: We're talking about this.

277
00:19:25,295 --> 00:19:32,524
Scott: the PC BIOS way of doing things that has been around For at least over a decade pretty much and it's still the stand.

278
00:19:32,584 --> 00:19:40,676
Rym: any non Mac computer You'll ever touch in your lifetime works the way we're about to describe and I'll warn you This is some archaic stuff.

279
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:48,425
Rym: The reasons things are the way they are is Arbitrary and due to the fact that there's been no reason to change this for many years.

280
00:19:48,806 --> 00:19:51,638
Rym: and don't feel bad If you don't know about this stuff.

281
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,030
Rym: a lot of times we make fun of people who don't know about things.

282
00:19:54,734 --> 00:20:01,909
Rym: Unless you grew up in our generation and you were a computer nerd There was really no reason for you to learn this stuff and I really don't blame you.

283
00:20:02,391 --> 00:20:10,330
Scott: Yeah, if you'd ever try to install an operating system or anything You're never gonna encounter this ever if you're just a computer user.

284
00:20:10,491 --> 00:20:11,776
Scott: So it's not.

285
00:20:12,459 --> 00:20:13,122
Scott: I mean, I didn't.

286
00:20:13,142 --> 00:20:16,189
Scott: even when the first time I encountered it I don't know what the hell was going on.

287
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:21,010
Scott: I had to freakin learn it on my own with huge chances of fucking up computers.

288
00:20:21,071 --> 00:20:27,023
Rym: Luckily the first time I really had to do this I built a computer from scratch and I had one hard drive and there was nothing on it.

289
00:20:27,344 --> 00:20:27,525
Scott: Yep.

290
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,572
Rym: So no trouble there Mm-hmm.

291
00:20:29,973 --> 00:20:31,659
Scott: All right, so a hard drive.

292
00:20:31,719 --> 00:20:32,663
Scott: What is a hard drive?

293
00:20:32,763 --> 00:20:33,285
Rym: Well, we're gonna.

294
00:20:33,486 --> 00:20:35,896
Rym: we're not gonna go into great detail We're not gonna go into detail.

295
00:20:35,937 --> 00:20:37,063
Scott: But you know, all right.

296
00:20:37,123 --> 00:20:37,364
Rym: All right.

297
00:20:37,425 --> 00:20:40,199
Rym: a hard drive is To skip all of the.

298
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,749
Rym: it's a thing you start data on.

299
00:20:42,694 --> 00:20:55,170
Rym: It's a bunch of platters magnetic platters that spin really fast and there's a little head and it can Put a magnetic field there or take a magnetic field away in a very controlled manner.

300
00:20:55,311 --> 00:20:58,643
Rym: It's more complicated than that and that's not exactly how it works.

301
00:20:58,744 --> 00:21:01,495
Rym: But as far as you're all concerned That's all you really need to know.

302
00:21:01,856 --> 00:21:05,170
Rym: it stores zeros and ones in magnetic fields on a spinning disk.

303
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:12,050
Scott: It's a magic little box that can hold like millions upon millions of zeros and ones now without letting go of them.

304
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:14,561
Scott: even if you turn it off those zeros and ones are still in there.

305
00:21:14,582 --> 00:21:23,555
Rym: a lot of different people make hard drives and Every hard drive the actual physical how it puts the data there is Actually a lot different.

306
00:21:23,635 --> 00:21:25,562
Rym: I mean every hard drive kind of works differently.

307
00:21:25,622 --> 00:21:28,010
Rym: different manufacturers sometimes do completely different things.

308
00:21:28,391 --> 00:21:31,504
Rym: But you know when you buy a hard drive on the outside of it or sometimes hidden inside.

309
00:21:31,545 --> 00:21:41,976
Rym: There's this big circuit board In there, it translates whatever stuff the hard drive manufacturer made into a standard that all Computers can understand.

310
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,370
Rym: So no matter what goes on inside the hard drive It all comes out the same.

311
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:49,300
Rym: So as far as you're concerned the hard drives are all the same.

312
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,491
Rym: you plug it in to whatever connector it uses and it just Works.

313
00:21:52,631 --> 00:22:02,065
Scott: Yeah, if you have a freaking hard drive for that fancy new perpendicular native command queuing all that jazz Those are just fancy words that say this hard drive is more awesome.

314
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:07,010
Scott: Yeah, you they're right Those hard drives are more awesome, but it doesn't actually change what you have to do.

315
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,485
Rym: Yeah, the connectors the same as far as you're concerned.

316
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:10,350
Rym: Everything's the same.

317
00:22:11,052 --> 00:22:15,508
Scott: If there's a serial ATA hard drive you might need a driver on Windows XP, but that's about it.

318
00:22:15,829 --> 00:22:19,569
Rym: Yeah Yeah, sometimes Linux with old motherboards with serial ATA.

319
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:33,060
Scott: Well, no if you're building the Linux kernel by hand you got to remember to include the stuff for your particular serial ATA Controller, but if you're using Ubuntu or any other Distribution that comes

320
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:33,542
Rym: with a

321
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:39,045
Scott: pre-compiled kernel for you You don't have to worry because your serial ATA hard drive will 99.9% of the time just work.

322
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:45,629
Rym: Yep, so we're not even going to talk about, you know ATA or you know SCSI or any of that.

323
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:47,438
Scott: Nope That's not what we're talking about.

324
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:49,650
Rym: We're talking about you've already got the hard drive.

325
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:50,915
Rym: You plug it into your computer.

326
00:22:51,196 --> 00:22:55,050
Rym: You flip whatever jumpers on it and go into your BIOS and you make it work.

327
00:22:55,594 --> 00:22:56,159
Rym: Now what?

328
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,490
Scott: It's a blank hard drive.

329
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,655
Scott: You turn your computer on.

330
00:22:58,675 --> 00:23:03,613
Scott: when you turn a computer on the first thing it does is it says, okay Let's turn on.

331
00:23:03,774 --> 00:23:09,513
Scott: and what it does is it looks for the first hard drive it can find or it looks for whatever you tell It to look for.

332
00:23:09,533 --> 00:23:09,734
Scott: you know.

333
00:23:09,754 --> 00:23:13,450
Scott: in the BIOS you say boot off the floppy boot off the CD, you know.

334
00:23:13,613 --> 00:23:14,468
Scott: And it goes there.

335
00:23:14,771 --> 00:23:23,575
Scott: It goes to the CD or the floppy or a USB thumb drive or usually the very first hard drive and it says Where's the data?

336
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:24,881
Scott: that tells me what to do next?

337
00:23:25,464 --> 00:23:29,580
Scott: and if there's nothing there it goes Non-system disk or disk error.

338
00:23:29,862 --> 00:23:34,250
Scott: I'm sure you've seen that at least once in your life Especially if you were back in the DOS days.

339
00:23:34,491 --> 00:23:35,133
Scott: You've seen that a lot.

340
00:23:35,233 --> 00:23:35,856
Rym: Oh god.

341
00:23:35,996 --> 00:23:39,910
Scott: In the DOS days you would see non-system disk or disk error all the time.

342
00:23:40,111 --> 00:23:46,210
Rym: I over wrote my MBR before I knew what an MBR was and I cried because I thought I'd broken my family computer.

343
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:55,670
Scott: Yep, non-system disk or disk error was a classic error from back in the day when you couldn't change the boot order on computers You'd put a floppy in there that you were using just to store some pictures.

344
00:23:55,751 --> 00:23:57,442
Scott: Yeah, and you turn the computer on.

345
00:23:57,462 --> 00:23:58,630
Scott: it would try to boot off the floppy.

346
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:03,349
Scott: They just had pictures on it and you'd be like say no non-system disk or disk error.

347
00:24:04,433 --> 00:24:06,225
Rym: Anyway, so you got this hard drive.

348
00:24:06,265 --> 00:24:06,708
Rym: you plug it in.

349
00:24:07,151 --> 00:24:13,590
Rym: There are a number of things in a very specific order that must be done to a raw hard drive to make it usable.

350
00:24:14,114 --> 00:24:23,337
Rym: the very first step aside from you know manufacturing the hard drive and putting it in a box and giving it electricity is Low level formatting.

351
00:24:23,377 --> 00:24:26,010
Rym: you might hear people use the term low level formatting.

352
00:24:26,572 --> 00:24:31,830
Rym: I will tell you right now you will never need to low level format a hard drive.

353
00:24:32,132 --> 00:24:36,468
Scott: There is one or two instances where you'll need to low level format a hard drive But they are rare.

354
00:24:36,891 --> 00:24:39,201
Rym: You'll probably sell that hard drive on eBay.

355
00:24:39,342 --> 00:24:46,570
Scott: if you were going to sell a hard drive on eBay You should probably low level format it so that no one scoops your data off of it that you left behind.

356
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:53,029
Rym: Yep But low level formatting is a thing that is done by the manufacturer to prepare the disk for data to be put on it.

357
00:24:53,411 --> 00:24:56,570
Rym: It is nothing to do with the formatting that you know and love.

358
00:24:56,711 --> 00:25:02,358
Scott: No, all they do is basically fill the drive zero with zeros And a couple other things like sometimes drives.

359
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,583
Rym: it calibrates everything.

360
00:25:03,603 --> 00:25:05,169
Rym: the heads make sure they're all lined up.

361
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,677
Rym: Yeah, some drives do like an internal diagnostic thing.

362
00:25:07,978 --> 00:25:08,720
Rym: none of that matters.

363
00:25:09,081 --> 00:25:10,645
Rym: low-level formatting pretend.

364
00:25:10,665 --> 00:25:11,528
Rym: It doesn't even exist.

365
00:25:11,708 --> 00:25:13,949
Scott: yep So what do you do after that huh?

366
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:21,165
Rym: Well, you know a drive can act like a whole bunch of different drives like you can have CD and e drive all on the same disk.

367
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:22,870
Scott: How do you do that?

368
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:29,013
Scott: See you only have one Actual physical hard drive in the computer, but your computer You know most computers.

369
00:25:29,073 --> 00:25:33,907
Scott: you have one physical hard drive desktop computers and on it'll say C Drive.

370
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:34,970
Scott: you have one hard drive.

371
00:25:35,431 --> 00:25:39,904
Scott: Well some people they have one hard drive in the computer, but it says CD EFG.

372
00:25:40,566 --> 00:25:41,188
Scott: How do they do that?

373
00:25:41,228 --> 00:25:41,428
Scott: Well?

374
00:25:41,489 --> 00:25:44,632
Rym: It's called partitioning Partitioning.

375
00:25:44,933 --> 00:25:46,158
Rym: it sounds like Sesame Street.

376
00:25:46,299 --> 00:25:46,680
Scott: as you know.

377
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,070
Scott: you put up partitions in a room to split it up.

378
00:25:49,491 --> 00:25:50,615
Scott: That's what partitions are.

379
00:25:50,895 --> 00:25:55,630
Scott: you split up the hard drive into pieces that all act as separate pieces?

380
00:25:56,292 --> 00:26:04,390
Scott: You know instead of having to go out and buy four hard drives that are 20 gigs each you can get 180 gig hard drive And split it into four 20 gig pieces.

381
00:26:04,631 --> 00:26:09,578
Scott: And it's essentially as far as the computer is the operating system is concerned It's sort of the same.

382
00:26:09,861 --> 00:26:12,296
Rym: now you might wonder Why would anyone do that?

383
00:26:12,677 --> 00:26:15,990
Rym: and the easy answer is that nobody does it anymore?

384
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,997
Rym: I mean unless you're dual booting these days.

385
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:22,126
Rym: There is almost no reason to partition a hard drive.

386
00:26:22,327 --> 00:26:26,270
Scott: well with Windows There's almost no reason to partition a hard drive.

387
00:26:26,732 --> 00:26:36,068
Scott: I mean if you're running Windows you just say and you're not doing anything else And you have one hard drive in your computer you say Windows take up the whole hard drive And you're done, and you don't do anything.

388
00:26:36,108 --> 00:26:37,501
Rym: yep You see part of the history here.

389
00:26:37,521 --> 00:26:38,409
Rym: is that back in the day?

390
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:39,151
Rym: There were.

391
00:26:39,252 --> 00:26:46,000
Rym: I mean even now there are limits as to how big a hard drive can be Because of how much you know space a computer can address.

392
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,066
Rym: and there are a whole bunch of factors there.

393
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:52,109
Rym: and a long time ago It used to be that a drive couldn't be very big at all.

394
00:26:52,632 --> 00:27:02,290
Rym: So if you had you know a four gigabyte drive you had to break it into two gigabyte Partitions because your computer could only see two gigabytes of a drive at a time.

395
00:27:02,931 --> 00:27:10,830
Scott: Mm-hmm also back in the day a lot of people you know would have a computer And they needed to have more than one operating system on the computer.

396
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:14,448
Scott: They needed you know a Unix and a DOS or something like that.

397
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:16,195
Scott: it What how could you get?

398
00:27:16,376 --> 00:27:17,862
Scott: you couldn't afford another hard drive.

399
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:18,444
Scott: god damn it.

400
00:27:18,484 --> 00:27:19,870
Scott: those things were expensive not like today.

401
00:27:20,051 --> 00:27:23,310
Scott: Hard drives are cheap as shit, and you can just get boxes full of these things.

402
00:27:23,751 --> 00:27:29,089
Scott: so people had to split those hard drives up into different pieces because you couldn't put two operating systems in the same piece.

403
00:27:29,109 --> 00:27:33,030
Scott: because Like I said before your computer turns on it looks at that hard drive.

404
00:27:33,131 --> 00:27:33,779
Scott: It wants to boot.

405
00:27:34,305 --> 00:27:34,730
Scott: so it's good.

406
00:27:34,911 --> 00:27:43,030
Scott: It you know it looks for the first partition of the master boot record Which is even before it's like the zeroth partition on a hard drive is the master boot record.

407
00:27:43,372 --> 00:27:46,989
Rym: It's kind of a hidden thing that you have to do special things to interact with.

408
00:27:47,069 --> 00:27:50,601
Scott: yeah And the master boot record doesn't exist on every hard drive in the universe.

409
00:27:50,962 --> 00:28:00,381
Scott: it can actually exist even on a CD or a floppy Drive, but it's sort of like on every and every storage Medium a CD of a hard drive a floppy.

410
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:04,232
Scott: there is space for a master boot record to go And it's either there Or it's not.

411
00:28:04,573 --> 00:28:16,583
Scott: and if it is if you put it there if you put a master boot record in the area where it belongs Which is like sort of the zeroth partition before everything else Then your computer can boot from that and it will be a system disk.

412
00:28:17,044 --> 00:28:20,709
Scott: if you do not put a master boot record there Then the computer will say I don't know how to boot from that.

413
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,416
Scott: What do you want me to do now?

414
00:28:22,457 --> 00:28:42,570
Rym: the other reasons that you'll want to partition nowadays is one Linux But I'll get to that in a minute But to a lot of people when they install Windows And this is pretty much been standard practice for me for as long as I've used Windows Which I've stopped using Windows, so it's kind of a moot point now I'd always install Windows on like a five or six gigabyte C Drive, and it would be just Windows.

415
00:28:42,692 --> 00:28:43,929
Rym: I would never put anything else there.

416
00:28:44,493 --> 00:28:49,222
Rym: Then I'd make another partition D Drive And that would be where all my applications would go.

417
00:28:49,382 --> 00:28:50,407
Rym: all my mp3s would go.

418
00:28:50,548 --> 00:28:58,542
Rym: everything else I own would go that way if I had to reinstall Windows because you know you had to do that periodically Because the way Windows was still do.

419
00:28:58,582 --> 00:29:07,979
Rym: we'll see if you had to do that with Vista I could just reinstall Windows wipe out the C Drive put a new Windows on and not have to deal with Backing up all my stuff or anything you know.

420
00:29:07,999 --> 00:29:08,180
Rym: because

421
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,421
Scott: when you

422
00:29:08,481 --> 00:29:10,228
Scott: install Windows on a partition

423
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,594
Scott: it Demands

424
00:29:11,654 --> 00:29:12,277
Scott: to completely

425
00:29:12,337 --> 00:29:13,381
Scott: erase that partition,

426
00:29:13,803 --> 00:29:15,290
Scott: so if you have important data there

427
00:29:15,551 --> 00:29:18,365
Scott: You have to back it up before you install Windows,

428
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:19,410
Rym: and that's always a pain.

429
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:22,923
Scott: It's always a pain, so if you have that data on a different partition.

430
00:29:23,003 --> 00:29:24,890
Scott: You can just not have to erase it.

431
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:25,512
Scott: It's all good.

432
00:29:25,954 --> 00:29:27,720
Rym: now on Linux a lot of you.

433
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:27,941
Rym: You know.

434
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:30,290
Scott: and Unix and any other Nix Solaris?

435
00:29:30,652 --> 00:29:31,437
Rym: Yeah, you know.

436
00:29:31,518 --> 00:29:33,490
Rym: you have in Windows your C Drive your D Drive.

437
00:29:33,591 --> 00:29:36,063
Rym: It's organized by drives or partitions.

438
00:29:36,284 --> 00:29:39,635
Rym: hmm in Linux There's a bet it's the same.

439
00:29:39,676 --> 00:29:43,024
Rym: it's there, but you don't interact with it directly.

440
00:29:43,425 --> 00:29:45,310
Rym: you don't interact per drive.

441
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:48,141
Rym: You don't care what hard drive something is.

442
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:49,947
Scott: well sometimes you do, but not as a user.

443
00:29:50,751 --> 00:29:53,250
Rym: You don't care as an administrator unless your drives are filling up.

444
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:53,512
Scott: Yeah,

445
00:29:53,854 --> 00:30:09,443
Rym: yeah, but as a user when you're using a Linux Unix Whatever you will have a file system that starts at roots and then there are folders in root and then there are folders in those folders and Instead of having a drive like you know in Windows C Drive D Drive.

446
00:30:09,483 --> 00:30:10,206
Rym: That's the bottom.

447
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:11,149
Rym: the drive starts there.

448
00:30:12,252 --> 00:30:17,029
Rym: Root doesn't really exist anywhere because the all the fault folders are in it.

449
00:30:17,511 --> 00:30:24,190
Rym: And then you can mount a drive like it was a C Drive anywhere you want hanging off of any other folder.

450
00:30:24,592 --> 00:30:26,060
Rym: I'm trying to be really non-technical here.

451
00:30:26,141 --> 00:30:27,710
Scott: so in Linux you have slash.

452
00:30:27,971 --> 00:30:29,254
Scott: Slash is the top your.

453
00:30:29,274 --> 00:30:32,604
Scott: when you're at slash you see everything and in slash.

454
00:30:32,644 --> 00:30:41,090
Scott: There's some folders like home user Var at C at you know bin and in those folders or other files now.

455
00:30:41,752 --> 00:30:43,399
Scott: Well, how do you know which hard drive it is?

456
00:30:43,439 --> 00:30:46,010
Scott: well slash needs to be on a partition somewhere?

457
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:51,386
Scott: So one of your partitions is slash and that contains everything now.

458
00:30:51,526 --> 00:30:52,750
Scott: What if you have another partition?

459
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:56,176
Scott: Well for example on my computer I have two hard drives.

460
00:30:56,417 --> 00:31:01,357
Scott: one computer is an 80. one of them is an 80 gig hard drive and one of them is 160 gig hard drive.

461
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:06,217
Scott: the 80 gig hard drive contains slash And it contains everything.

462
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:21,697
Scott: everything that you know belong all those files at C. Everything is on that 80 gig hard drive except the hundred and sixty gig hard drive is Mounted to slash home, so if I go to the home folder Which is where all the user stuff is.

463
00:31:21,737 --> 00:31:25,470
Scott: you know the users personal files and my mp3s, and you know everything.

464
00:31:26,232 --> 00:31:27,676
Scott: That's actually a different hard drive.

465
00:31:27,716 --> 00:31:30,344
Scott: now if I just used one hard drive.

466
00:31:30,885 --> 00:31:36,530
Scott: It would look no different to the user It's it would go to slash home slash their username and their files would be there.

467
00:31:36,912 --> 00:31:39,769
Scott: It would just all be on one hard drive the same hard drive as everything else.

468
00:31:40,452 --> 00:31:46,751
Scott: But what I did is I put slash home on a different hard drive which means Anything.

469
00:31:46,992 --> 00:31:52,350
Scott: files that happen to be in the slash home folder are actually on this other drive somewhere on a different partition.

470
00:31:52,695 --> 00:31:53,569
Scott: No different file system.

471
00:31:53,751 --> 00:31:56,119
Rym: There are a lot of benefits to doing this sort of thing.

472
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,070
Rym: and because you're not we're not doing this for system administrators.

473
00:31:59,291 --> 00:32:01,884
Rym: You all know the other reasons to partition and all this.

474
00:32:02,446 --> 00:32:06,350
Rym: but as a user Here's the kind of the best example as to why this is a good thing.

475
00:32:06,852 --> 00:32:11,309
Rym: And then I've got something kind of enlightening that a lot of people don't know about Windows that you might be happy about.

476
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:12,544
Rym: you might Want to play with mm-hmm?

477
00:32:13,311 --> 00:32:19,170
Rym: Let's say I have a whole bunch of mp3s, and I have one hard drive and my whole slash is my whole hard drive.

478
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,563
Rym: I just got this whole big hard drive and all my stuff is in it.

479
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:30,577
Rym: one big partition You know being simple here and all my mp3s are in slash user slash media slash share Which is where you would never put them.

480
00:32:30,678 --> 00:32:38,858
Rym: no no, but you could you could I guess yeah bad move yeah, but let's say they're there and Suddenly, I'm running out of hard drive space.

481
00:32:38,878 --> 00:32:40,483
Rym: my mp3s have filled up the whole drive.

482
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,790
Rym: say I buy a brand new 5000 gigabyte hard drive.

483
00:32:45,372 --> 00:32:57,949
Rym: So what I can do is mount that hard drive copy all my mp3s to it and then mount The unmount it from wherever I stuck it and then mount that hard drive at usershare media where all my mp3s were.

484
00:32:58,812 --> 00:33:06,950
Scott: So now all the programs like you know your music playing program And you're all your playlists that say the music isn't you as our share media.

485
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,281
Scott: You know they're used to looking there for music.

486
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:10,587
Scott: They don't have to look somewhere else.

487
00:33:10,607 --> 00:33:11,170
Scott: You know Windows.

488
00:33:11,612 --> 00:33:16,779
Scott: Let's say you had all your music and C colon something and then you got a new hard drive And you move all your music to it.

489
00:33:17,182 --> 00:33:24,350
Scott: now your music is on D Colon something and you have to tell all your programs to look somewhere else to find your music and Linux not the case.

490
00:33:24,813 --> 00:33:27,816
Rym: Yep, so now you've upgraded your space But you haven't had to.

491
00:33:27,837 --> 00:33:38,941
Rym: I mean I see a lot of people have a Windows computer and they have a drive f drive because they keep buying new computer or new hard drives and sticking them in and They don't realize that you can do the same thing in Windows.

492
00:33:38,981 --> 00:33:46,869
Rym: starting with Windows 2000 you can go to the disk manager Take a new hard drive or a partition and just mount it somewhere pretty much just like you do in Linux.

493
00:33:47,532 --> 00:33:49,099
Scott: Yeah, only if you use NTFS.

494
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:49,622
Scott: It's called.

495
00:33:50,104 --> 00:33:51,390
Scott: What is it called virtual directories?

496
00:33:52,951 --> 00:33:55,170
Rym: Yeah, you can look up how to actually do it.

497
00:33:55,331 --> 00:33:58,230
Scott: I mean in Linux and Unix.

498
00:33:58,371 --> 00:34:00,819
Scott: That's the way things work in Windows.

499
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,549
Scott: that's sort of like a hack thrown in but it does work.

500
00:34:03,831 --> 00:34:08,126
Scott: Mostly mostly not a hundred percent, but yeah, it'll work if you're just using Windows.

501
00:34:08,187 --> 00:34:11,157
Scott: It'll work just fine You won't care makes no difference to you.

502
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:19,650
Rym: now all this partitioning sounds great, but a lot of people have problems Especially if they try to make more than four partitions on a drive.

503
00:34:20,812 --> 00:34:22,178
Rym: This is the archaic part.

504
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:29,204
Rym: you see you can only have four Primary partitions on a drive period.

505
00:34:29,545 --> 00:34:30,350
Scott: yep, that is it.

506
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:31,762
Scott: That's the limit you can partition.

507
00:34:31,822 --> 00:34:32,750
Scott: you see you have a hard drive.

508
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:35,327
Scott: You can split it up into four pieces no more.

509
00:34:36,272 --> 00:34:39,764
Rym: This hearkens back to a long time ago for reasons you don't care about.

510
00:34:39,784 --> 00:34:41,753
Scott: yep now What?

511
00:34:42,255 --> 00:34:44,710
Scott: but people split up hard drives into more than four pieces?

512
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:47,121
Rym: Yeah, you can put a lot of partitions on a hard drive.

513
00:34:47,504 --> 00:34:48,610
Scott: Oh, but how do they do that?

514
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,036
Scott: We just said it could only be four.

515
00:34:50,378 --> 00:34:50,739
Rym: Yeah, well.

516
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,170
Rym: I said four primary partitions.

517
00:34:54,810 --> 00:35:01,508
Rym: Yeah, you see there are other kinds of partitions, but really there's only two kinds of partitions primary and logical.

518
00:35:01,949 --> 00:35:05,630
Rym: now To make it real simple a primary partition is a partition.

519
00:35:06,274 --> 00:35:16,672
Rym: If you if you make three primary partitions And you need more than four you make your fourth primary partition and then inside of that you break it up into logical Partitions.

520
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:21,390
Rym: as far as your computer is concerned the operating system and all that they're just more partitions.

521
00:35:21,951 --> 00:35:28,327
Rym: Whether a partition is primary or logical has no bearing on anything other than making the partition.

522
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:42,090
Scott: the only time you have to pay Attention to the primary and logical partitions is when you're actually making the partitions and configuring them because if you don't Understand the difference in primary and logical you're not going to set it up right and it's going to be all weird?

523
00:35:42,351 --> 00:35:47,050
Rym: Yeah, because if you screw up partitioning your computer is going to have trouble down the road.

524
00:35:47,392 --> 00:35:50,269
Rym: You're gonna run into problems that you are not going to expect.

525
00:35:50,771 --> 00:35:51,795
Scott: Here's the problem.

526
00:35:51,835 --> 00:35:58,880
Scott: a lot of people have a partitioning is you know they have a computer and it's already set up with a certain partition scheme and they want to change it.

527
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:16,730
Scott: and rather than just erase it and You know figure out how they want their system to be and then choosing the correct partition scheme They try to shrink a partition and then put some new ones in there And they basically keep modifying the current setup and trying to turn it into something that works.

528
00:36:17,152 --> 00:36:17,854
Scott: You can't do that.

529
00:36:18,156 --> 00:36:19,160
Scott: It really doesn't work out.

530
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:19,361
Scott: Well.

531
00:36:19,421 --> 00:36:21,570
Scott: You have to say what drives do I have?

532
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,210
Scott: What do I want to install?

533
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:28,330
Scott: How do I want to configure it and then choose the correct partition scheme?

534
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:32,104
Scott: For your needs and set it up that way from scratch.

535
00:36:32,144 --> 00:36:33,430
Scott: don't go modifying me.

536
00:36:33,731 --> 00:36:34,313
Scott: You can.

537
00:36:34,614 --> 00:36:43,050
Scott: you can shrink and resize and chop up partitions and with all sorts of partition magic tools But you're only asking for trouble in the long run if you do that.

538
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:52,769
Rym: Yeah, not only is that dangerous because that's those sorts of operations will not often, but a non-trivial amount of the time fail Wiping out your data.

539
00:36:52,971 --> 00:36:54,797
Scott: I can't tell you how many times they get a story.

540
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:58,330
Scott: some guys like I was trying to modify some partitions something something.

541
00:36:58,431 --> 00:37:07,098
Scott: No, you back up your data You could you erase all the partitions you figure out how you want the partitions set up and you make it from scratch In the correct method.

542
00:37:07,299 --> 00:37:09,369
Scott: that is the safe and good way to do it.

543
00:37:09,932 --> 00:37:13,905
Scott: So, how do you decide what partition scheme is the best for you?

544
00:37:14,206 --> 00:37:18,149
Rym: Well if you're using Windows There are a lot of ways you can go about it.

545
00:37:18,511 --> 00:37:25,930
Rym: What I recommend very generally is make a partition to install Windows on and then make other partitions for everything else.

546
00:37:26,493 --> 00:37:26,694
Scott: Mm-hmm.

547
00:37:27,017 --> 00:37:27,682
Rym: That's really it.

548
00:37:27,722 --> 00:37:28,670
Rym: You can do whatever you want.

549
00:37:29,292 --> 00:37:38,670
Rym: I would recommend that you mount new hard drives in the file system like in you would in Linux Instead of making you know e drive f drive g drive z drive.

550
00:37:39,352 --> 00:37:42,690
Scott: My suggestion for Windows would be you have a hard drive.

551
00:37:43,071 --> 00:37:48,027
Scott: You want to give like 10 to 20 gigs for your Windows part because that's gonna grow it.

552
00:37:48,248 --> 00:37:48,990
Scott: That's where your registry.

553
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:49,572
Scott: Yeah, stuff.

554
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:52,260
Rym: I usually gave six gigs, but that was with Windows 2000.

555
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:55,530
Rym: Yeah, and that was really pushing the line.

556
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:56,995
Scott: 15 is probably good.

557
00:37:57,035 --> 00:37:59,545
Scott: Yeah, cuz hard drive especially hard drives are so big nowadays.

558
00:37:59,565 --> 00:38:00,167
Scott: It won't hurt.

559
00:38:00,328 --> 00:38:04,810
Rym: you can buy a 350 gigabyte drive for very little money less than a hundred bucks.

560
00:38:05,351 --> 00:38:31,230
Scott: Then you're probably gonna want to have another drive and you want to mount that at the documents and settings folder because that way You can keep all your music and all your movies and your all your photos in the my pictures my videos my Music folders in your my documents folder, you know, you know where that is Yeah and that it'll be on that documents and settings partition that You want to make that as big as you can because that's where you're gonna put all your multimedia.

561
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,553
Scott: So now your computer

562
00:38:32,574 --> 00:38:32,754
Scott: won't

563
00:38:32,794 --> 00:38:48,420
Scott: be confused because you're not storing your music and like C colon backslash music or some other weird-ass place You're storing it in my documents my music, but if the documents and settings folder is actually another partition That's a really big and that works out really really well.

564
00:38:48,901 --> 00:38:51,770
Scott: that way, you know, if you lose your music you reinstall Windows.

565
00:38:52,353 --> 00:38:55,630
Scott: You just say hey, yeah make that the documents and settings folder again.

566
00:38:55,971 --> 00:38:59,306
Scott: All of a sudden all your settings and all your music are back where they were like nothing's happened.

567
00:38:59,707 --> 00:39:00,230
Scott: It's a good move.

568
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:03,458
Rym: Yep Though sometimes that sort of thing will give you trouble.

569
00:39:03,699 --> 00:39:09,810
Rym: if because Windows applications tend to not deal with a lot of things Well, yeah, it depends on the application.

570
00:39:10,031 --> 00:39:16,021
Rym: So if you have applications that are dodgy or that'll cause trouble, you know Applications that like to save their data in places like that.

571
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:17,488
Rym: You have to make sure it's not there.

572
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:22,406
Scott: Yeah, if you're using say Firefox iTunes G aim that kind of stuff.

573
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:23,430
Scott: It'll be happy as a clam.

574
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:32,619
Rym: Yeah, but or if you're just not comfortable doing that whole mounting drives where they're not a drive letter thing Mm-hmm, just make you know, I'll see.

575
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,609
Rym: I'll partition a C partition for Windows.

576
00:39:34,689 --> 00:39:42,253
Rym: make it You know 10 15 20 gigs by 20. make the rest of that drive your D drive and then every new hard drive make it One big partition.

577
00:39:42,634 --> 00:39:44,739
Rym: Yep, and let NTFS do its thing.

578
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,161
Scott: Yep.

579
00:39:45,662 --> 00:39:48,570
Scott: Now if you're using Linux, there's a bunch of different ways to go about it.

580
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:56,435
Scott: You're gonna have to first this the you can either make slash boot a separate partition or not And it depends.

581
00:39:56,455 --> 00:39:58,721
Scott: if you're using gen 2 it's probably a good idea.

582
00:39:58,741 --> 00:40:02,530
Scott: if using Ubuntu you won't have you really Really?

583
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:08,930
Rym: I think we'd have to do a whole separate Episode on Linux stuff because yeah, there are different ways to go about it and there's no right way.

584
00:40:09,113 --> 00:40:09,950
Scott: There is no right way.

585
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,843
Scott: You really have to know what you're using it for.

586
00:40:11,964 --> 00:40:28,250
Scott: if you have a server You really want to make /var a separate partition because if a log file gets out of control Which it happens often it could fill up your entire Partition and then nothing will be able to write to log files and your server applications will stop working.

587
00:40:28,411 --> 00:40:33,410
Rym: Yep, and then there's also the issue of you need a swap partition which Windows does swapping very differently.

588
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:36,281
Rym: You'll make a swap file on a drive.

589
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:36,622
Rym: Mm-hmm.

590
00:40:36,763 --> 00:40:38,650
Rym: And in fact, you could have multiple swap files.

591
00:40:38,973 --> 00:40:53,045
Rym: So if you have multiple physical hard drives you want to have a swap file on every hard drive so that Windows can be more efficient and access these drives simultaneously or Alternate access the swap from one while it's accessing the data from another.

592
00:40:53,467 --> 00:40:54,089
Rym: that sort of thing.

593
00:40:54,390 --> 00:41:02,350
Rym: Yep, Linux you make entire swap partitions and there's all sorts of neat stuff Like say you have you can also make swap files, but you want to make a swap partition.

594
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:03,514
Rym: But let's say you have multiple.

595
00:41:03,555 --> 00:41:05,582
Rym: Linux is installed on one computer.

596
00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:07,510
Rym: They can all share swap files.

597
00:41:07,771 --> 00:41:08,714
Scott: Yeah, you can just have.

598
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:13,270
Scott: if yeah, let's say I have three different Linuxes on the same computer on the first three primary partitions.

599
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:19,550
Scott: Well, the fourth primary partition is gonna be a swap and all the different Linuxes can use that same swap.

600
00:41:20,273 --> 00:41:24,150
Rym: It doesn't really matter because once you turn off a computer, whatever was in the swap doesn't matter anymore.

601
00:41:24,411 --> 00:41:28,250
Rym: Yeah, because if it mattered it was written out to disk in the real part of the disk where it mattered.

602
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:32,450
Scott: Now you generally want your swap partition to be twice as much as you have RAM.

603
00:41:32,591 --> 00:41:35,606
Scott: So if you have a gig of RAM you want a 2 gig swap partition?

604
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:38,129
Rym: Yeah now again There's all sorts of different things you could do.

605
00:41:38,552 --> 00:41:42,330
Rym: Like there are people who have like a solid-state drive and they put their swap there.

606
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:46,254
Rym: So it's just like more RAM and all sorts of crazy A lot of you'll put get.

607
00:41:46,294 --> 00:41:49,885
Scott: they get more RAM and they put the swap partition at a RAM Drive.

608
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:53,114
Rym: Yeah, but that kind of It does.

609
00:41:53,275 --> 00:41:55,023
Scott: you're better off just having that be RAM.

610
00:41:55,284 --> 00:41:56,269
Rym: Yeah, you really are.

611
00:41:57,032 --> 00:42:09,698
Scott: Yeah, the way the Linux kernel handles swapping versus the way the windows handles It is 10,000 times more intelligent and if you have enough RAM and you never use up all your RAM Linux will almost never use the swap.

612
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:12,910
Scott: ever windows use the swap even if you don't do anything.

613
00:42:14,251 --> 00:42:18,569
Rym: Yeah, there's also neat stuff like say you have a not pic CD or something a live CD and you want to boot it.

614
00:42:18,589 --> 00:42:19,011
Rym: use It.

615
00:42:19,414 --> 00:42:25,421
Rym: a lot of them will look and if they see a swap partition They'll just use it and your live CD will work a lot faster.

616
00:42:26,003 --> 00:42:26,825
Scott: Oh, it sure will.

617
00:42:26,886 --> 00:42:28,129
Rym: That's a big deal.

618
00:42:29,032 --> 00:42:33,584
Rym: Granted you shouldn't be using live CDs on a regular basis for computing.

619
00:42:33,764 --> 00:42:45,188
Scott: No use live CDs for oh I'm going to install an operating system or oh, I need to diagnose this computer or oh I'm in someone's house with scary spy word windows and I want to check my email exactly.

620
00:42:45,509 --> 00:42:49,350
Rym: Yeah Now we could go on and we'll probably have to break this up.

621
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:55,508
Rym: But the next show we do though There's a lot of confusion especially due to the way Windows works about file systems.

622
00:42:55,669 --> 00:42:55,910
Rym: and what?

623
00:42:56,050 --> 00:43:07,470
Rym: Formatting a drive means because in Windows when you format a drive it actually does two different things And in Linux and the red Unix and the rest of the world you do those two different things separately.

624
00:43:07,771 --> 00:43:14,670
Scott: Well, I think the reason that this confusion occurred is because back in the day, you know with DOS and whatever You would just format floppy drives.

625
00:43:14,791 --> 00:43:18,516
Scott: you format floppy disks and You just format them and you knew that.

626
00:43:18,537 --> 00:43:22,550
Scott: that meant you would completely erase the floppy disk and get it ready for being used.

627
00:43:22,951 --> 00:43:24,616
Scott: And that's all you knew about formatting.

628
00:43:25,037 --> 00:43:29,168
Scott: now the details of that are much more important and we'll get into that the next time.

629
00:43:29,209 --> 00:43:30,415
Rym: we continue This series.

630
00:43:30,495 --> 00:43:35,420
Scott: on hard drives if you have questions Ask them in the forum and ask Google.

631
00:43:35,742 --> 00:43:36,666
Scott: Yeah, Google knows all.

632
00:43:37,169 --> 00:43:43,510
Rym: yeah Probably you don't want to email us with a hard drive question because we probably won't get a chance to answer you.

633
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:45,961
Rym: But if you post in the forums, there's a good chance.

634
00:43:46,021 --> 00:43:47,187
Rym: Even if we don't get to you right away.

635
00:43:47,227 --> 00:43:47,910
Rym: Someone else will.

636
00:43:48,211 --> 00:43:53,064
Rym: Yeah, the people in our forums are pretty smart and except for one of you out there You know who you are.

637
00:43:53,145 --> 00:43:56,389
Rym: Yeah And to be honest ruins all isn't me?

638
00:43:56,651 --> 00:44:00,804
Scott: I get asked a lot of questions every day through Q new and and other places.

639
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:02,630
Rym: you mean like the GeekNights email address?

640
00:44:02,911 --> 00:44:11,223
Scott: Well, no mostly Q new only occasionally with the GeekNights email address, but most of those questions I just go to Google find the answer and tell it to the person.

641
00:44:11,444 --> 00:44:12,830
Rym: Yeah, we should start charging money.

642
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:18,170
Rym: We'll have a service where you pay us and you ask us anything and we'll answer it by going to Google and Wikipedia.

643
00:44:18,611 --> 00:44:22,321
Scott: Yes, so before you open your mouth ask Google first.

644
00:44:22,843 --> 00:44:26,942
Rym: if Google doesn't know the answer the odds are We don't either.

645
00:44:26,962 --> 00:44:37,142
Rym: Yeah This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

646
00:44:37,162 --> 00:44:39,290
