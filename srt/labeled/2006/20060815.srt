00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,997
Scott: It's Tuesday August 15th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,459 --> 00:00:17,219
Scott: tonight We bring you our coverage of gaming at Otakon and the following week of awesome.

3
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:19,256
Rym: Let's do this.

4
00:00:20,045 --> 00:00:29,144
Rym: Well, we're back and yet again I do not have a pop filter since no one seems to sell the things I need to make them other than craft stores Which I hate But he hate craft stores.

5
00:00:29,185 --> 00:00:29,907
Scott: craft stores are awesome.

6
00:00:29,927 --> 00:00:34,120
Rym: craft stores sell mostly smelly things now or things that I have no interest in.

7
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,380
Scott: It really depends on the craft store.

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:36,841
Scott: I mean the.

9
00:00:37,343 --> 00:00:52,280
Scott: Joanne mostly specializes in fabrics and all sorts of tailoring kind of stuff and Like Michaels sells all mostly arty stuff the kind of stuff that like art students need and AC Moore sells like crafty stuff.

10
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,867
Rym: Well, my beeps are that one.

11
00:00:54,068 --> 00:00:56,760
Rym: every craft store just smells really really bad.

12
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,177
Scott: They know that's because they have the the fake flower shit and they have the.

13
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:01,860
Rym: yeah, you know what?

14
00:01:02,302 --> 00:01:02,684
Rym: That's it.

15
00:01:02,844 --> 00:01:06,120
Rym: that alone is enough for me to hate craft stores, I don't like things that smell bad.

16
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,023
Rym: Yeah, he's close.

17
00:01:07,063 --> 00:01:07,926
Scott: I don't like that either.

18
00:01:07,986 --> 00:01:12,420
Scott: But you know, they sell important things, but they also sell annoying thing.

19
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,020
Rym: Well for me, they only sell one thing in the world I need and that is embroidery loops.

20
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,270
Rym: I think I'm going to buy a thousand of them.

21
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,580
Scott: I don't think you need a thousand.

22
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,787
Rym: They're three cents each.

23
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:25,074
Rym: I can buy all of them.

24
00:01:25,215 --> 00:01:26,940
Scott: Yeah, but I don't think you need a thousand.

25
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:28,327
Scott: I think ten would suffice.

26
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:29,312
Rym: I think I'll go for a hundred.

27
00:01:29,332 --> 00:01:30,840
Scott: I think that's too many.

28
00:01:31,122 --> 00:01:31,504
Rym: You know what?

29
00:01:31,706 --> 00:01:32,209
Rym: You know what I'll do.

30
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,840
Rym: I'll just buy all the embroidery loops.

31
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,324
Rym: They have.

32
00:01:34,767 --> 00:01:40,773
Scott: that way I can always make pop filters But what are you gonna do with all the ones that you're not using?

33
00:01:40,813 --> 00:01:43,743
Rym: I'll dump them in that box where I dump everything else I don't use.

34
00:01:43,763 --> 00:01:47,518
Rym: it's full of cables from old computers a bunch of my old DS games.

35
00:01:47,558 --> 00:01:48,120
Rym: I don't lie.

36
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,537
Scott: I think we're gonna have to make something out of like a hundred embroidery a hundred pop filters.

37
00:01:52,938 --> 00:01:55,729
Scott: Yeah I don't think we need a hundred pop filters.

38
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,215
Rym: I could make a condom slingshot.

39
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:58,340
Scott: That would work.

40
00:01:59,301 --> 00:02:01,931
Scott: I think we're gonna end up like having disposable pop filters.

41
00:02:01,971 --> 00:02:04,220
Scott: like we use one we throw it out kind of like razor blade.

42
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,775
Rym: You know, it's kind of a good idea because many pop filters start to smell like.

43
00:02:08,417 --> 00:02:09,020
Rym: you know those.

44
00:02:09,702 --> 00:02:11,226
Rym: We talk about these often in person.

45
00:02:11,246 --> 00:02:14,536
Rym: I don't think we've mentioned them on the show, but things called tonsilloliths.

46
00:02:15,037 --> 00:02:27,259
Rym: Mm-hmm and Eventually, well very briefly if you've ever had a pickling picking sensation in the back of your throat and eventually you coughed up a tiny Little white nodule that smelled like the worst thing you've ever smelled in your life.

47
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:28,785
Scott: That's what that is.

48
00:02:28,805 --> 00:02:29,953
Scott: It doesn't smell like the worst thing.

49
00:02:30,013 --> 00:02:30,960
Scott: It's the second worst thing.

50
00:02:31,061 --> 00:02:33,820
Scott: The worst thing would be like a rotting corpse or something like that.

51
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:34,243
Rym: I don't know.

52
00:02:34,263 --> 00:02:36,700
Rym: a rotting corpse might be somewhat pleasant compared to a tonsillolith.

53
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,606
Scott: Remember when the trash had that chicken in it.

54
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,312
Scott: that smells worse than a tonsillolith.

55
00:02:40,954 --> 00:02:46,055
Rym: True true, you know Yeah, but tonsilloliths are real bad mainly because your body makes them.

56
00:02:46,337 --> 00:02:52,518
Scott: Yep basically, what happens is shit gets in the back of your throat and your body the tonsils grab it and

57
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:01,909
Rym: Actually to be a little more specific there are like deep holes in your tonsils called I think they're called Crips at least that's what I've read them to be called

58
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:02,913
Scott: the Crip

59
00:03:03,154 --> 00:03:04,157
Rym: the Crip keeper.

60
00:03:04,177 --> 00:03:09,520
Rym: Yes and Infections and dead bacteria end up building up in there and then they're expelled in little white nodules.

61
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:22,900
Rym: The point is they smell bad and pop filters over time start to smell like that just because you're constantly talking into them Yep, and the fact that they're made out of things other than metal my microphone which is made of metal doesn't smell bad?

62
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,068
Rym: Nope, of course yours did that one time.

63
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,136
Rym: Yeah that one time.

64
00:03:28,297 --> 00:03:31,606
Rym: Yep Anyway, we got a bit of news today.

65
00:03:31,626 --> 00:03:32,570
Rym: I guess Scott can go first.

66
00:03:32,991 --> 00:03:33,914
Rym: It is video game day.

67
00:03:34,296 --> 00:03:35,400
Scott: Check out this crazy shit.

68
00:03:35,643 --> 00:03:38,446
Scott: We're always complaining that You know, we want it.

69
00:03:38,507 --> 00:03:41,360
Scott: if you want to make a PC game, you can make a PC game.

70
00:03:41,461 --> 00:03:42,933
Scott: You can make a Mac game.

71
00:03:42,953 --> 00:03:43,840
Scott: You can make a Linux game.

72
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,045
Scott: No one can stop you.

73
00:03:45,467 --> 00:03:52,430
Scott: and if you want to make a game for an older console The only reason that no one can stop you is because those computers are.

74
00:03:52,911 --> 00:03:58,047
Scott: those consoles are so old and their technology is so well-known That you can do it.

75
00:03:58,107 --> 00:04:00,500
Scott: You know there we have perfect NES emulators.

76
00:04:00,601 --> 00:04:02,699
Scott: So if you want to make an NES game, you're good to go.

77
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,759
Scott: If you want to make a TI calculator game, you're good to go.

78
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,999
Rym: In fact, a lot of people are making NES games and Atari games because it's fun to do.

79
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:12,852
Scott: Yep, someone recently released for sale a Sega Genesis game.

80
00:04:12,973 --> 00:04:13,956
Scott: I think we talked about it.

81
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:15,020
Scott: Maybe I don't remember.

82
00:04:16,202 --> 00:04:23,180
Scott: The point is is that you still can't make a GameCube game or a PlayStation 2 game.

83
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,768
Scott: I think you can make a PlayStation 2 game.

84
00:04:24,788 --> 00:04:27,300
Scott: I'm not sure you can't make an Xbox game.

85
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:30,770
Rym: Really that he said you really can't make Nintendo games.

86
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,478
Scott: You really can't make GameCube games, you know.

87
00:04:33,498 --> 00:04:41,380
Scott: and In the newest round of consoles, you know mean even people with dev kits can't make ps3 games.

88
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:48,420
Scott: No one can make a Wii game even though they said they're gonna make the dev kits for Wii and DS a lot cheaper.

89
00:04:48,782 --> 00:04:53,666
Scott: They did but they still not giving them out to average people, you know I can't go and get one.

90
00:04:53,786 --> 00:04:58,732
Rym: even if I could afford one we could get one of those bootleg ones But then we really couldn't ever release our game.

91
00:04:58,953 --> 00:05:03,911
Scott: Yeah, but Microsoft has finally done something smart way to go.

92
00:05:04,412 --> 00:05:07,020
Scott: They're having this XNA program.

93
00:05:08,301 --> 00:05:18,780
Scott: The deal is just about anyone will be able to make games for the Xbox 360 and the PC for Little to no money.

94
00:05:18,942 --> 00:05:19,879
Scott: I think you know.

95
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:27,820
Scott: I read in a couple places that it'd be free and I read in a couple other places to be like $100 a year, which is essentially Oh, whatever nothing.

96
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,508
Rym: And yeah, how much was it?

97
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:31,840
Rym: when we asked Nintendo if we could get a DS dev kit?

98
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,420
Rym: It was like 10 grand or something stupid.

99
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,782
Scott: $10,000 and $10,000.

100
00:05:35,782 --> 00:05:37,572
Rym: that's my sign.

101
00:05:37,612 --> 00:05:38,980
Scott: non-disclosure agreements.

102
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:41,871
Rym: I can buy a. pretty good you have to be a company.

103
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:44,400
Scott: the Microsoft is gonna be giving this thing out.

104
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,462
Scott: It's like college students.

105
00:05:45,582 --> 00:05:47,466
Rym: I could live off a 10 grand for a year.

106
00:05:47,486 --> 00:05:56,900
Scott: Yeah, you see and it's really cool because Because an Xbox is basically a computer with Windows and DirectX and a computer runs Windows and has DirectX.

107
00:05:57,281 --> 00:06:00,815
Scott: So if you make a game for one, it doesn't take much to make a game for the other.

108
00:06:00,975 --> 00:06:02,019
Scott: That's the exact same game.

109
00:06:02,922 --> 00:06:21,855
Scott: So this XNA development kit that Microsoft is going to be just handing out to people like willy-nilly Will allow any doofus on the street who knows how to write code to make a game once and that game will run on the Xbox 360 and The PC and that's freaking awesome.

110
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:33,910
Rym: I gotta say As much as I generally dislike Microsoft as much as I really don't particularly like the original Xbox I'm getting more and more excited about the Xbox 360 as time goes on.

111
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:37,760
Rym: Microsoft really seems to have turned itself around at least gaming wise.

112
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:41,511
Scott: Yeah, I mean as far as games go on the 360.

113
00:06:41,511 --> 00:06:48,017
Scott: I mean I was thinking about it for that Oblivion game which I don't know if I'm gonna like but it's so.

114
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:48,460
Scott: you know what?

115
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,460
Rym: I don't think you would like it at all because I remember that I was trying to get you way back to play all Those old quest for glory games and your primary I don't know.

116
00:06:55,681 --> 00:07:05,114
Rym: I think this is more like a Baldur's Gate unless like your primary complaint was that you're thrown into a world and You can go anywhere and do anything and there's no like.

117
00:07:05,154 --> 00:07:06,339
Rym: here's the thing to do next.

118
00:07:06,864 --> 00:07:16,120
Scott: Yep, that games a lot like that I know But it's first person as opposed to the because the thing I disliked about Baldur's Gate the most was the controlling the combat.

119
00:07:16,361 --> 00:07:20,680
Scott: We had like pause it and shit and it was the worst interface, but oblivion is first person.

120
00:07:20,801 --> 00:07:22,309
Scott: So I'm thinking that might have a chance.

121
00:07:22,329 --> 00:07:24,400
Rym: Have you ever played a first-person RPG before?

122
00:07:25,343 --> 00:07:27,640
Rym: Did you ever play Ravenloft or Menzoberranzan?

123
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,147
Scott: No But I've played things like dungeon master.

124
00:07:30,187 --> 00:07:37,093
Scott: the ones were like you you see like a dungeon in front of you and all you can Do is you know face nor you can change your facing north-south east.

125
00:07:37,153 --> 00:07:42,453
Rym: wait dungeon master or dungeon hack Dungeon master dungeon hack was one of the first PC games.

126
00:07:42,513 --> 00:07:45,442
Scott: I purchased legitimately Wow And you know.

127
00:07:45,462 --> 00:07:50,640
Scott: you drag the items like into the arm slot and yeah, yeah Ravenloft was kind of like that.

128
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:54,770
Rym: Those are sometimes okay, I've never played a game like that.

129
00:07:54,811 --> 00:07:55,954
Rym: that was even moderately.

130
00:07:56,074 --> 00:07:58,460
Scott: Okay, I've played two that were okay.

131
00:07:58,801 --> 00:07:59,584
Rym: I mean the best.

132
00:07:59,725 --> 00:08:09,616
Scott: one of them was a share where I got back in the AOL days downloading off AOL And the other one was I forget But it's not the point.

133
00:08:10,563 --> 00:08:11,125
Scott: The point is.

134
00:08:11,306 --> 00:08:34,106
Scott: the point is is that they're very few Xbox 360 games I'm excited about and the prospect of the fact of People around the world making a shit ton of crazy games for it for very little cost that hopefully I'll be able to download for free and possibly make my own game is Worth the price of a ps3 and the fact that it the cost of entry is the price of an Xbox 360.

135
00:08:34,106 --> 00:08:34,552
Scott: I say whoo

136
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:46,820
Rym: Plus just the fact that I think of all the crazy Awesome game ideas that the front row crew comes up with on a regular basis that we can't do solely because we don't have the And it's not worth it to make a game like that for nothing.

137
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:51,174
Scott: Like the thing is a lot of our crazy game ideas are for the DS or the Wii.

138
00:08:51,194 --> 00:09:01,900
Scott: Yeah, so it's still gonna be hard but I Note that the Xbox 360 has the steering wheel and the headset of talking which could provide for many interesting games.

139
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,133
Rym: Someone should make some sort of tie fighter ish game.

140
00:09:04,153 --> 00:09:13,019
Scott: I Predict someone is going to make some sort of beat mania or be money games involving various peripherals.

141
00:09:13,644 --> 00:09:19,899
Rym: huh Yeah, it seems like every time so he does something stupid Microsoft counters by doing something smart.

142
00:09:21,351 --> 00:09:32,204
Rym: Yep speaking of Sony Of all the people in the world who are pissed off at Sony which is rapidly growing to include every living human being EA now has a bone.

143
00:09:32,245 --> 00:09:34,732
Scott: don't make good TVs kinda sort of.

144
00:09:34,772 --> 00:09:37,219
Rym: maybe we only bought that TV because it was cheap.

145
00:09:37,721 --> 00:09:40,892
Scott: I know there are people who make better TVs, but Sony TVs ain't bad.

146
00:09:41,313 --> 00:09:42,497
Rym: Yeah, Sony DVD players.

147
00:09:42,537 --> 00:09:44,624
Rym: However, whoa Now?

148
00:09:45,066 --> 00:09:53,160
Rym: EA is slightly miffed with Sony right now because EA Wanted to invest a lot in the PSP and make a whole bunch of EA games for the PSP.

149
00:09:54,262 --> 00:09:57,400
Rym: Now the PSP is failing and even EA admits this.

150
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:06,035
Rym: In fact EA's primary complaint with Sony is that they're letting the DS beat the PSP and that the PSP is fast becoming a non viable console.

151
00:10:08,282 --> 00:10:17,940
Rym: And they're basically trying to force Sony to lower the price of the PSP lower the licensing costs and Aggressively promote the system before it dies completely.

152
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:23,820
Scott: You know what if they lower the price of the PSP enough, I'd buy one to do everything but play games.

153
00:10:24,442 --> 00:10:28,420
Rym: You know what if I didn't own an iPod, I probably would have bought a PSP if it were cheaper.

154
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,048
Scott: Yeah, I mean I was thinking today.

155
00:10:30,109 --> 00:10:37,999
Scott: Hey, you know if I had a PSP it has Wi-Fi So I could totally do stuff with it like control different things around the house and shit like that.

156
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:40,333
Scott: But it's too much money.

157
00:10:40,575 --> 00:10:43,126
Rym: Yeah, plus I mean Oh, you can listen to mp3s on it.

158
00:10:43,387 --> 00:10:44,491
Rym: Like I can in my iPod.

159
00:10:44,631 --> 00:10:47,100
Rym: Oh, you can surf the web on it without a touchscreen.

160
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:49,950
Rym: Oh the DS has an opera cartridge.

161
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,680
Scott: Yeah, the opera on the DS though hasn't been getting the greatest reviews.

162
00:10:52,781 --> 00:10:53,607
Scott: I don't think I'm really.

163
00:10:53,748 --> 00:10:55,380
Rym: I've seen a lot of people give it really good reviews.

164
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,360
Scott: I don't think I'm gonna get it just because I don't have a use for that.

165
00:10:58,621 --> 00:11:00,188
Rym: I mean I kind of do.

166
00:11:00,288 --> 00:11:02,980
Rym: I don't have a laptop or anything and I don't plan to buy one anytime soon.

167
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,420
Scott: Yeah, yeah, I guess if you have a smartphone then it's kind of silly to get it.

168
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,299
Scott: But if you don't have a smartphone or a laptop, so it might be good for you.

169
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:20,317
Rym: Yeah, cuz I am definitely cell phone wise I buy I get the freest cheapest most durable phone I can get and when it breaks I get the next cheapest most durable phone I can get.

170
00:11:20,477 --> 00:11:24,549
Rym: Yep Mainly because I beat the hell out of my phones and I tend to leave them places.

171
00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:25,612
Scott: Yeah, good job.

172
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:26,655
Rym: Yeah good job.

173
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:37,400
Scott: Oh PSP you know, I think what it is is that EA Doesn't really make hit DS games like the kind of games EA makes don't do well on the DS.

174
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:42,201
Scott: And I think that's why EA realized and they're pushing the Wii pretty hard is You know?

175
00:11:42,221 --> 00:11:44,412
Scott: like that, you know, they think they can make games for that.

176
00:11:45,116 --> 00:11:45,779
Scott: try something new.

177
00:11:46,221 --> 00:11:48,007
Scott: But yeah, you look at the hit DS games.

178
00:11:48,027 --> 00:11:49,693
Scott: There are no EA titles in there.

179
00:11:49,914 --> 00:11:51,640
Scott: EA makes games that are for the PSP.

180
00:11:51,901 --> 00:11:54,658
Rym: Well EA for the longest time mean their games are pretty formulaic.

181
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:58,860
Rym: Yeah Yeah, they've got a formula to make games that make money and the formula works really well.

182
00:11:59,282 --> 00:12:02,240
Rym: The formula doesn't work on a system that has something special going for it.

183
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,920
Scott: Yeah, that's why I think what they did is they they do have a big DS push.

184
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,235
Scott: They're making all these DS games, you know, but where they they don't have.

185
00:12:10,255 --> 00:12:13,566
Scott: I mean Wii games But they don't have good game.

186
00:12:13,907 --> 00:12:16,635
Scott: EA has Wii games, but they don't have DS games.

187
00:12:16,675 --> 00:12:18,280
Scott: So the PSP dies.

188
00:12:19,161 --> 00:12:21,840
Scott: EA's portable gaming is pretty much down the shitter.

189
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:33,156
Rym: I also have the sneaking suspicion that EA has put a lot of money into training people to develop for the PSP and That money will go completely down the tubes if the PSP actually completely fails.

190
00:12:33,356 --> 00:12:39,971
Rym: Oh, that's a good thinking Yeah, and it doesn't cost them anything to yell at Sony I mean what a press release that cost like five bucks.

191
00:12:40,252 --> 00:12:42,240
Rym: Yeah, but enough about the PSP for now.

192
00:12:42,765 --> 00:12:44,100
Rym: I have a couple of interviews.

193
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:52,131
Rym: We took at Otakon That I'll play at the end of the episode where for the first time in a long time We found people at an anime con who had PSPs.

194
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:54,580
Rym: Holy crap, and we talked pretty much.

195
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,460
Rym: I talked to almost every person who had a PSP that I saw at the con.

196
00:12:58,581 --> 00:13:08,940
Rym: I didn't interview all of them, but I interviewed a few of them and The general consensus among the PSP kids was that either they should have gotten a DS or that the PSP is kind of meh

197
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:20,920
Scott: You know the only comment I really have on this is that I learned that a lot more people do have PSPs than you'd think and Many of them are not using them to play games, you know, they're using that.

198
00:13:21,061 --> 00:13:28,060
Scott: I mean they do play games one or two games But they're mostly using them to listen to music or watch videos and stuff or emulate Nintendo games.

199
00:13:28,661 --> 00:13:36,705
Scott: However, a lot of people the reason it doesn't look like there are so many PSPs at a convention is because a lot of people They keep them hidden.

200
00:13:36,725 --> 00:13:37,529
Scott: They're not using them.

201
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:38,372
Scott: They don't have them out.

202
00:13:38,453 --> 00:13:40,140
Rym: Well, they're not really a social system.

203
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:43,000
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, there might be at a convention.

204
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:47,197
Scott: Let's say you go to a convention and half the people have DSs and half the people have PSPs.

205
00:13:47,237 --> 00:13:48,620
Scott: the people have PSPs.

206
00:13:49,002 --> 00:13:52,580
Scott: they have these things in their pockets or in their backpacks that were at their iPods.

207
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,760
Scott: I mean, you don't see a lot of iPods at a convention, but you know, there's a shit ton of them.

208
00:13:56,283 --> 00:13:58,960
Scott: It's because it's not something that you'd walk around with at a convention.

209
00:13:59,254 --> 00:14:02,015
Scott: Yeah PSP is gonna talk to people with headphones in your ear.

210
00:14:02,035 --> 00:14:02,658
Scott: you don't do that.

211
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,663
Rym: a PSP is.

212
00:14:03,804 --> 00:14:06,214
Rym: you sit there and you're bored in line with no one to talk to.

213
00:14:06,255 --> 00:14:07,460
Rym: so you play your PSP for a while.

214
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,988
Rym: Yeah a DS you don't?

215
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:11,380
Rym: you don't see many people sitting alone playing a DS.

216
00:14:12,022 --> 00:14:14,050
Scott: You'll walk through the can see them huddled in a circle.

217
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:19,942
Rym: or you see a guy with a DS and you whip yours out and you Say you want to play Bomberman and he says, oh, yeah Let's bomb it.

218
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:23,698
Rym: or you jump in a picture chat and there are 16 people drawing penises.

219
00:14:23,878 --> 00:14:34,898
Scott: Yeah Yeah, you see the DS, you know, if you're sitting at a panel No one's gonna take their PSP at a panel because that's an intention stealing device It doesn't you know, it takes you away from the panel to play PSP.

220
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,748
Scott: DS is an enhancing device.

221
00:14:37,788 --> 00:14:43,471
Scott: You can have your DS out at a panel and Picto chatting adds like a sub channel to the panel.

222
00:14:43,752 --> 00:14:45,098
Scott: It doesn't distract you from it.

223
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:51,748
Scott: So Keep even though there might be a lot of PSPs out there It doesn't seem like it because people don't whip them out.

224
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:55,339
Scott: DS is are constantly whipped out constantly all the time.

225
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,960
Rym: Anyway at the end of this episode the bonus content for this week will be that you'll get a couple of those interviews.

226
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:03,991
Rym: We did the ones that were actually legible.

227
00:15:04,031 --> 00:15:15,483
Rym: and well that legible but understandable things of the day Thingy.

228
00:15:16,274 --> 00:15:18,909
Rym: How do you always say thingy after I say things of the day?

229
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,321
Scott: Wasn't there somebody Python thing where they were like thingy thingy.

230
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:24,529
Rym: There was a fish a fish a fishy.

231
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:30,795
Scott: No, I'm pretty sure there was some sort of thingy thingy thingy Tangs, I don't remember.

232
00:15:30,835 --> 00:15:32,141
Scott: they said thingy at one point.

233
00:15:32,462 --> 00:15:32,985
Rym: I don't know.

234
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,190
Rym: I've got the whole box set.

235
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,013
Rym: We have to watch it all.

236
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:38,006
Scott: maybe it was in one of those video games or something.

237
00:15:38,026 --> 00:15:42,402
Rym: All right Anyway, I it might be there's a lot of good jokes in those video games.

238
00:15:42,563 --> 00:15:44,751
Scott: I had one for Windows 3.1.

239
00:15:44,751 --> 00:15:52,159
Rym: I had the a holy grail game and but the biggest thing I remember about it was that there was one game Where there's cows falling from the sky.

240
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:57,490
Rym: you have all these soldiers or Knights and when you click on them They go right and they turn right.

241
00:15:58,572 --> 00:15:59,906
Rym: Yeah, and that was the whole game.

242
00:16:00,777 --> 00:16:02,588
Rym: It was fantastic awesome.

243
00:16:03,652 --> 00:16:05,062
Rym: Anyway, my thing of the day.

244
00:16:05,082 --> 00:16:08,298
Rym: I Couldn't really find a good thing of the day other than that.

245
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:11,290
Rym: I have a slight correction from yesterday's thing of the day.

246
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:14,781
Rym: It was actually our good friend Kat who was the one who showed us dad's home.

247
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,997
Rym: Okay, I didn't remember and she reminded me So it was cat.

248
00:16:18,017 --> 00:16:18,584
Rym: Mm-hmm.

249
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:23,770
Rym: Anyway, I was looking for a thing of the day and I discovered something somewhat startling.

250
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,777
Rym: This is one of Scott's done this before.

251
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:29,270
Rym: it's an ad for an old video game or video game system.

252
00:16:30,151 --> 00:16:30,674
Rym: This is from the 80s.

253
00:16:30,774 --> 00:16:36,139
Rym: And it's a. it's an ad for the Atari 2600.

254
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:38,876
Scott: Oh God It's 70s commercial.

255
00:16:38,936 --> 00:16:39,860
Rym: No, it's definitely from the 80s.

256
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:48,330
Rym: All right, in fact, there are comments Talking about how the people who said is from the 70s are dumb because defender came out in the 80s for the Atari.

257
00:16:48,773 --> 00:16:50,323
Rym: Okay, among other things.

258
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:54,138
Rym: Mm-hmm All I have to say is I own in to Atari 2600 space and an

259
00:16:54,158 --> 00:16:54,960
Scott: Atari 7800 and when I was

260
00:16:55,703 --> 00:17:05,380
Rym: a small child It was my life's dream to own an Atari 5200 because for some reason I had it in my mind that that was the best gaming system ever.

261
00:17:05,623 --> 00:17:09,317
Rym: Yeah Probably because I'd never seen one or played a game on it.

262
00:17:09,637 --> 00:17:13,690
Rym: Yeah, that would probably be why it was like this rare magical thing.

263
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:21,410
Rym: No one had ever seen one, but I'd heard of them I'd seen ads about them, but I'd never actually seen touched or felt one.

264
00:17:22,932 --> 00:17:26,844
Rym: So I wanted one and then I got a Nintendo and yeah.

265
00:17:27,185 --> 00:17:28,549
Rym: Yeah, that was the end of that.

266
00:17:28,933 --> 00:17:30,068
Scott: It was indeed the end of that.

267
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:33,460
Scott: All right, my thing today is something everyone's seen by now.

268
00:17:34,611 --> 00:17:46,170
Scott: someone took Megaman X and Megaman X 2 and they turned them on at the same time and Using the magic technology of emulation.

269
00:17:46,972 --> 00:17:51,827
Scott: What they did is they basically plug the same controller into both systems.

270
00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:55,843
Scott: So they push a. You know both Megaman jump.

271
00:17:56,385 --> 00:18:00,720
Scott: if they push B Both Megaman shoot in both games.

272
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,529
Scott: if they push left both Megaman go left, etc, etc.

273
00:18:04,532 --> 00:18:06,477
Rym: Now how far does he get in these games?

274
00:18:06,858 --> 00:18:11,070
Scott: Well, it's not actually a person playing because a person playing would die.

275
00:18:12,171 --> 00:18:16,463
Scott: However, because it's not a person playing it's someone scripting all the input.

276
00:18:16,724 --> 00:18:23,414
Scott: by magic emulation technology They actually beat both games Goddamn.

277
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:37,790
Scott: Yeah, so the exact same series of input into the controller can beat either Megaman X or Megaman X 2 both games which I have beaten on separate occasions.

278
00:18:38,792 --> 00:18:42,430
Rym: Yeah, it does come down to the fact that Nintendo games are deterministic.

279
00:18:43,011 --> 00:18:52,787
Scott: Yeah, it's like if you input these buttons in this way as in, you know, hold down left for three seconds push a you know Then you'll beat the game.

280
00:18:53,792 --> 00:19:08,590
Rym: So they just figured out one possible set of inputs that would beat both games Which is pretty cool Because currently the main thing is speed runs Figuring out the exact sequence of buttons to beat the game in the quickest amount of time.

281
00:19:09,433 --> 00:19:14,390
Rym: I could see this becoming a thing where people try to find weird games that you can beat with the same input.

282
00:19:14,932 --> 00:19:22,585
Scott: See though because it's Megaman X and Megaman X 2 which are similar games with similar inputs I want to see like Tetris and Mario 1.

283
00:19:22,585 --> 00:19:25,015
Scott: Yeah, I want to see weird I want to see more than two games.

284
00:19:25,095 --> 00:19:28,567
Scott: Also, I want to see like four or five games watch every Megaman game.

285
00:19:29,028 --> 00:19:44,034
Scott: Oh No, no, but one thing they kind of do to cheat it's not really cheating is like They'll beat one level and you know in between levels there's parts of the game where no matter what button you push It doesn't do anything.

286
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:48,530
Scott: So during those times in the other game, they're going as fast as they can just straight ahead.

287
00:19:49,472 --> 00:19:52,708
Scott: You know stuff like stuff like that, but it works out in the end.

288
00:19:53,553 --> 00:20:04,237
Rym: But anyway for everyone who doesn't live under a rock we spent the last weekend prior at Otakon and then we spent the week right after that in the front row.

289
00:20:04,257 --> 00:20:11,767
Scott: crews typical yearly retreat called the week of awesome week of Awesome and this year's week of awesome was awesome.

290
00:20:11,968 --> 00:20:14,516
Rym: Yes So we've got two bits of gaming coverage.

291
00:20:14,557 --> 00:20:21,397
Rym: first gaming at Otakon as a whole which we don't do a lot of mostly because Otakon We can get gaming at any time.

292
00:20:21,418 --> 00:20:22,260
Scott: too much partying.

293
00:20:22,301 --> 00:20:23,906
Scott: No time for gaming though.

294
00:20:23,926 --> 00:20:25,110
Rym: We did play in the video game room.

295
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:29,306
Scott: Yeah, we spent more time in the video game room this Otakon than ever before.

296
00:20:29,326 --> 00:20:38,745
Rym: true though I do most of my gaming at cons at well gaming cons and Katsucon I actually game a lot because they have the old-school arcade with the old-school arcade machine.

297
00:20:38,765 --> 00:20:40,290
Scott: They had a few old-school arcade machine.

298
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:43,420
Rym: No, they had an old-school arcade at Katsucon.

299
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,550
Scott: Yeah, I know but at Otakon they did have like five or six machines.

300
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,599
Rym: They did and they had a DDR machine.

301
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,005
Rym: Yep, Dan.

302
00:20:50,045 --> 00:20:51,030
Rym: They never did that before.

303
00:20:51,713 --> 00:20:52,656
Scott: If they did we didn't notice.

304
00:20:52,677 --> 00:20:55,910
Rym: well, they usually had like red octane pads and then big projectors.

305
00:20:56,111 --> 00:20:57,336
Scott: I think they also had those.

306
00:20:57,376 --> 00:21:00,609
Scott: I'm not sure but I think it was an extreme machine, wasn't it?

307
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,976
Rym: There's no way they would have gotten a supernova.

308
00:21:03,197 --> 00:21:03,498
Scott: Yeah.

309
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,185
Scott: Yeah, we got supernova.

310
00:21:05,346 --> 00:21:05,968
Rym: Oh, yeah, we did.

311
00:21:06,491 --> 00:21:10,230
Rym: Anyway, so we'll start with Otakon now Otakon's gaming room.

312
00:21:10,491 --> 00:21:13,167
Rym: If you've never been to Otakon and it's no idea than

313
00:21:13,248 --> 00:21:14,573
Scott: most Conventions

314
00:21:14,834 --> 00:21:20,190
Rym: like both in size and a number of people and possibly in scale of events

315
00:21:20,996 --> 00:21:29,330
Scott: yeah, if you Compared to like remember went to gaming for hope that it was a LAN party and it was a bunch of video game tournaments.

316
00:21:30,073 --> 00:21:33,729
Scott: It was basically a fundraiser for child's play at the local college.

317
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,164
Rym: Yeah I'm pretty sure we talked about it on the show.

318
00:21:35,185 --> 00:21:41,840
Scott: way back We had this an episode about it and we took up the entire Gymnasium or one of the gymnasiums at the school.

319
00:21:41,961 --> 00:21:44,630
Scott: I think it was an auxiliary gymnasium, but it could have been the main one.

320
00:21:44,731 --> 00:21:47,469
Scott: I don't really know because I don't walk around the school.

321
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:49,918
Scott: The point is is that was pretty big.

322
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:56,357
Scott: the gaming room at Otakon was Six times the size of that.

323
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:03,570
Scott: maybe a little more maybe a little more say So and that was just the gaming room of Otakon.

324
00:22:04,051 --> 00:22:08,364
Scott: It took the game rule of Otakon is smaller than the dealers room of Otakon.

325
00:22:08,444 --> 00:22:13,890
Rym: when we saw a game across the room that we Thought the artist alley of Otakon is the same size as the video.

326
00:22:14,515 --> 00:22:16,149
Rym: We would see a game that was free.

327
00:22:16,571 --> 00:22:26,824
Rym: We would have to walk for at least a minute to get close enough to that game to find out if it was worth playing Or not or even what game it was and someone probably sat down in the game before you did.

328
00:22:26,844 --> 00:22:27,366
Scott: Yeah.

329
00:22:27,386 --> 00:22:29,794
Rym: Yeah Though what did we play?

330
00:22:29,814 --> 00:22:30,196
Rym: We played.

331
00:22:30,376 --> 00:22:33,910
Rym: we played this awesome Japanese wrestling game for five players.

332
00:22:33,991 --> 00:22:35,850
Scott: It was a Japanese pro wrestling game.

333
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:43,022
Scott: You basically pick a generic looking pro wrestler and then you mash buttons until you win or lose Fight.

334
00:22:43,183 --> 00:22:49,490
Rym: I lasted until the end and That's only because I figured something out right away that no one else did for a while.

335
00:22:49,781 --> 00:22:50,412
Scott: Yeah I didn't.

336
00:22:50,674 --> 00:22:52,463
Scott: it took me like a minute to figure it out.

337
00:22:52,544 --> 00:22:53,710
Rym: your wrestler gets tired.

338
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:58,576
Rym: Yeah, you hold down a button when no one's around you you can And catch your breath.

339
00:22:58,838 --> 00:23:00,930
Scott: Oh, see my guy was going.

340
00:23:01,972 --> 00:23:08,422
Rym: That meant you were over exerting and you had to rest but he wasn't Regaining any resting because you have to hold down the rest button.

341
00:23:09,045 --> 00:23:09,607
Scott: I didn't know.

342
00:23:09,929 --> 00:23:12,869
Rym: Yeah That's why I'd last until the end when we all gave up.

343
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:16,403
Scott: I also if I would have known how to play a little earlier.

344
00:23:16,443 --> 00:23:18,090
Scott: I wouldn't have gotten tired as quickly.

345
00:23:18,892 --> 00:23:20,550
Rym: Yeah, well mainly how you played this game.

346
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:28,623
Rym: We don't know what it was called or what system moves for you walk over and you hit a bunch of buttons in this Random a fashion as you can and hope that you pin a guy.

347
00:23:28,664 --> 00:23:29,990
Scott: pretty sure it was a PlayStation.

348
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,075
Scott: What PlayStation 2?

349
00:23:32,075 --> 00:23:33,259
Scott: what kind of controllers were we used?

350
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:34,183
Rym: It was something weird.

351
00:23:34,605 --> 00:23:35,348
Rym: was all I remember?

352
00:23:35,368 --> 00:23:37,816
Scott: Wow I don't even remember what controller I was using.

353
00:23:38,397 --> 00:23:38,859
Scott: crazy.

354
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:40,544
Scott: Yeah, really crazy.

355
00:23:40,644 --> 00:23:42,731
Rym: I don't think it was a turbo graphics 16.

356
00:23:42,731 --> 00:23:43,554
Scott: No, no, no, though.

357
00:23:43,594 --> 00:23:45,019
Rym: That is a five player system.

358
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:45,461
Scott: Yep.

359
00:23:45,601 --> 00:23:46,444
Scott: It is it is.

360
00:23:46,565 --> 00:23:46,685
Scott: Huh?

361
00:23:46,705 --> 00:23:50,080
Rym: Yeah other than that I mean, there's the gaming room at.

362
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,270
Rym: Otakon is a con unto itself.

363
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:58,890
Rym: I know people who go to Otakon and spend their entire con there not many but they do exist and you know what?

364
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,389
Rym: It's a pretty damn good gaming con in and of itself.

365
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:05,609
Scott: Yeah, most people just go and they sign up for one of those tournaments there or a couple of them.

366
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:12,914
Rym: Yeah, they do a lot of tournaments and the thing is Otakon tournaments are incredibly professionally run at least from what I hear I've never actually entered one.

367
00:24:13,014 --> 00:24:18,750
Scott: Yeah, so we take that with some salt grains, but you know, they don't run any interesting tournaments.

368
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:31,085
Rym: They oh, yeah They had Mario Kart double-dash Smash Brothers Melee four-player Soul Calibur 3 beat mania Street Fighter 3 Third strike pop and music Smash Brothers Melee one-on-one.

369
00:24:31,145 --> 00:24:32,249
Rym: That would've been kind of neat to watch.

370
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,640
Rym: DDR extreme DDR fifth mix and guilty gear.

371
00:24:36,661 --> 00:24:37,483
Rym: Yep.

372
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:38,767
Rym: Oh and that Naruto game.

373
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:46,599
Scott: Oh great For I'm so at least it wasn't the standard, you know, Halo What are the other ones that everyone does?

374
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:48,388
Rym: Yeah, there was no Halo tournament.

375
00:24:48,629 --> 00:24:49,516
Scott: Yep So that was.

376
00:24:49,536 --> 00:24:51,210
Scott: that was cool that there was no Halo tournament.

377
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,843
Rym: Well, the thing is it wasn't a lot of like.

378
00:24:53,884 --> 00:24:55,130
Rym: there weren't so many Xbox.

379
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:58,470
Rym: You know the modern cool games that all the punk hip kids are playing.

380
00:24:59,092 --> 00:25:01,703
Rym: It was mostly older weird games that people really liked.

381
00:25:01,723 --> 00:25:01,824
Rym: like.

382
00:25:01,844 --> 00:25:06,121
Rym: there's a lot of Bomberman around Yeah, a lot of Soul Calibur - you know, they always have.

383
00:25:06,181 --> 00:25:10,120
Scott: I think what's really popular to kind of the shmups You know, they get a lot of.

384
00:25:10,281 --> 00:25:11,830
Rym: they had a whole Karuga there.

385
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,423
Rym: There was a section of the Karuga's with TVs tilted on their sides.

386
00:25:15,644 --> 00:25:20,050
Scott: Yep, because that's the only way to play Ikaruga It was the side tilted TV and I saw people playing Ikaruga.

387
00:25:20,654 --> 00:25:28,095
Rym: basically I saw a few people who really knew what they were doing and then I saw people who play shmups the way I play shmups Trying to play Ikaruga.

388
00:25:28,537 --> 00:25:32,070
Scott: Yeah, I mean I have pride and I'm somewhere in between.

389
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:36,204
Rym: I'm humble enough to admit that I am bad at shmups.

390
00:25:36,324 --> 00:25:37,889
Rym: I cannot play them.

391
00:25:38,972 --> 00:25:43,202
Rym: The only one I've ever been even remotely passable at was area 88.

392
00:25:43,202 --> 00:25:45,828
Scott: Yeah, you can't even play raptor.

393
00:25:45,848 --> 00:25:46,630
Scott: call the shadows.

394
00:25:47,451 --> 00:25:48,814
Rym: Raptor was actually really easy.

395
00:25:48,834 --> 00:25:51,983
Rym: Yeah, I wouldn't really count that that was too easy or Galaga.

396
00:25:52,264 --> 00:25:54,069
Rym: Oh, I suck at Galaga Galaxian?

397
00:25:57,791 --> 00:25:59,741
Rym: Yeah, yeah, I suck at all those games.

398
00:26:00,203 --> 00:26:00,404
Rym: Mm-hmm.

399
00:26:00,545 --> 00:26:01,248
Rym: I just can't do it.

400
00:26:01,751 --> 00:26:06,529
Rym: Hmm, in fact having me on your team and Ikaruga as a second player only fucks you.

401
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:21,129
Rym: Yes, it does All right, but yeah Yeah outside of the gaming room There was a lot of DS gaming going on too much in fact to the point that usually at cons We do a lot of DS gaming, but we really didn't have time.

402
00:26:21,491 --> 00:26:33,160
Scott: But I can say that almost everywhere I went there was a group of people playing their DS's And whenever you turned your DS on there was a picto chat and whenever you went into a picto chat Someone was asking to play Mario Kart or Tetris or something.

403
00:26:33,581 --> 00:26:33,782
Rym: Yep.

404
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:36,210
Scott: Oh, this was definitely the biggest game.

405
00:26:36,492 --> 00:26:40,216
Rym: I don't know a lot of people were trying to play Bomberman Yeah, but I still.

406
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:43,749
Scott: Tetris has definitely been the number one game of the week and Otakon and every.

407
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,710
Rym: yeah At least for us Tetris has been the big game.

408
00:26:45,773 --> 00:26:54,609
Scott: Yeah I saw Tetris going on more than anything else even just at the con between other people because I think with the Tetris It's just so easy to do the pickup games.

409
00:26:54,730 --> 00:27:03,470
Scott: It's like up Tetris up Tetris up Tetris, you know, the other games are a little bit more difficult sometimes, you know now There's really not much more we can honestly say about the Otakon gaming.

410
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,053
Rym: Well, there is.

411
00:27:04,113 --> 00:27:06,605
Scott: there was a little gaming area for tabletop gaming.

412
00:27:07,188 --> 00:27:08,613
Rym: Oh, yeah I didn't even go over there.

413
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:15,537
Scott: Basically all that happens over there is like one company promotes the Inuyasha card game And that's about it.

414
00:27:15,999 --> 00:27:18,410
Rym: It was mostly people hanging out looking for a place to sit.

415
00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:25,973
Scott: Yeah They put that in the corner of the artists alley and it's also an area where people eat food after buying it at the nearby Concession stand.

416
00:27:26,033 --> 00:27:29,024
Scott: so, you know people aren't really into that so much.

417
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:37,457
Rym: at Otakon, which I guess is okay but I mean at other cons we go to I tend to play a lot of gaming so I can cover it and I You know, I watch the tournaments and I talk to the people running.

418
00:27:37,497 --> 00:27:38,320
Rym: I'm gonna interview people.

419
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:42,060
Rym: but at Otakon again, it's just so big I didn't have time.

420
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:56,968
Rym: so Look tomorrow for our primary coverage of Otakon And we really don't have anything else to say about video gaming at Otakon because we did most of that in Wildwood and in Beacon, ah Wildwood, New Jersey where there was so much DDR.

421
00:27:57,314 --> 00:28:06,320
Rym: Yeah so Wildwood you can tell that we were kind of we had to do the Otakon part forcibly so we could get to the Wildwood part a while back at the 4th of July.

422
00:28:06,341 --> 00:28:08,388
Scott: how many DDR supernova machines do they have?

423
00:28:08,669 --> 00:28:11,082
Rym: Oh god There's like 12 on the whole boardwalk.

424
00:28:11,102 --> 00:28:12,450
Scott: There were three in that one arcade.

425
00:28:12,611 --> 00:28:14,278
Rym: Yeah, the we played.

426
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:22,286
Rym: in fact I played more DDR in Three days in Wildwood that I have played in the last two years combined.

427
00:28:22,547 --> 00:28:23,290
Scott: Yeah, that's about right.

428
00:28:24,034 --> 00:28:24,397
Scott: I also.

429
00:28:24,498 --> 00:28:39,173
Scott: I regained my DDR skill, you know It's like, you know You play DDR and you build up to your maximum skill level and then you sort of have like this maintained level of skill Where no matter how long you go without playing you'll always be at least this good You know.

430
00:28:39,213 --> 00:29:01,650
Scott: and you slowly decline down to that level and I had declined mostly to that level and You know, so but after playing, you know, I would play a game here and a game there and that wouldn't really get me You know improved at all, but at Wildwood I played enough that I was like, aha I'm back in this and I was like I was failing some six-footers and now it's like seven foot or whatever.

431
00:29:02,091 --> 00:29:07,448
Rym: Yep, in fact by the end of the third day we pretty much maxed out our doubles skills again.

432
00:29:07,468 --> 00:29:08,836
Rym: Yep Yep.

433
00:29:08,856 --> 00:29:09,825
Scott: Yeah, I love them doubles.

434
00:29:10,268 --> 00:29:21,088
Rym: Yep but I mean we got there and We talked about it before that there's all these DDR 9th mix machines and there's one arcade that has five DDR machines all in the same area.

435
00:29:21,892 --> 00:29:25,129
Scott: Well, one of them is an in the groove - one of them is an eighth mix.

436
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:25,973
Rym: What does that make?

437
00:29:25,993 --> 00:29:26,374
Rym: seventh me.

438
00:29:26,435 --> 00:29:27,539
Scott: one of them is the seventh make.

439
00:29:27,579 --> 00:29:29,085
Rym: the other three are supernovas.

440
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:31,796
Rym: Oh supernova Good God was.

441
00:29:32,078 --> 00:29:33,985
Rym: there's so much gaming going on.

442
00:29:34,026 --> 00:29:34,929
Rym: It was just insane.

443
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:42,290
Rym: Constant DDR playing so basically for three days in a row the entire front row crew except for one day.

444
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:43,675
Rym: What about half of the front row crew did?

445
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:47,490
Rym: it would go to this arcade and for like four or five hours?

446
00:29:47,771 --> 00:29:55,330
Rym: Just constantly play DDR Like I'd play a set with say Jess and I'd finish and then I'd walk over and I see Scott about to start one.

447
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,434
Rym: So I jump on his pad.

448
00:29:56,715 --> 00:30:04,870
Rym: we finish then Scott goes and plays with James and I play with Pete and then I go play With Yuko and Jess goes plays with Lisa and we just constantly played DDR.

449
00:30:05,051 --> 00:30:06,721
Rym: I must have spent at least 60 or 70 bucks.

450
00:30:07,023 --> 00:30:15,473
Rym: I didn't spend that much money Well on all of my gaming total, but I played a whole lot of DDR there because in his first on the gaming of DDR Was air hockey.

451
00:30:15,934 --> 00:30:16,596
Scott: Oh air hockey.

452
00:30:16,676 --> 00:30:20,486
Scott: which on the last night they freaking taped up the air hockey machines.

453
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:21,128
Scott: We couldn't play.

454
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:21,810
Scott: it was bullshit.

455
00:30:22,433 --> 00:30:25,289
Rym: Yeah, you know what Rym was ahead by what three games?

456
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:28,768
Scott: Yeah, cuz I didn't get to play you on a day when I wasn't tired.

457
00:30:28,808 --> 00:30:32,018
Scott: and yeah When you were tired they taped up the machines.

458
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,903
Rym: I am confident that I would have won.

459
00:30:34,004 --> 00:30:35,829
Scott: no, I'm confident I would have won.

460
00:30:36,951 --> 00:30:38,797
Scott: When I lost I was confident I would lose.

461
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:39,961
Rym: So yeah.

462
00:30:40,101 --> 00:30:40,382
Rym: Yeah.

463
00:30:40,623 --> 00:30:41,987
Rym: The thing is I'm up over all too.

464
00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:43,432
Scott: Yeah, we'll see It doesn't matter.

465
00:30:43,452 --> 00:30:45,640
Rym: We're like Mugen and what's-his-name in samurai.

466
00:30:45,681 --> 00:30:48,190
Rym: Champloo when it comes to DDR mean air hockey.

467
00:30:48,673 --> 00:30:50,868
Scott: Yeah, when it comes to DDR, we're not that good.

468
00:30:50,888 --> 00:30:51,190
Scott: You know what?

469
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:54,020
Rym: We were that good compared to the punk kids at the shore.

470
00:30:54,402 --> 00:30:56,390
Scott: Yeah, there were a few punk kids who were actually good.

471
00:30:56,771 --> 00:31:01,110
Scott: Well, the thing is most of them are like rail grabbing teen punks.

472
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,943
Rym: Yeah, there was only one other person at the shore.

473
00:31:03,963 --> 00:31:05,370
Rym: I could see who could play DDR.

474
00:31:05,671 --> 00:31:07,537
Rym: Well without holding on to that bar.

475
00:31:07,797 --> 00:31:08,118
Scott: Yeah.

476
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,182
Rym: Yeah, of course.

477
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:11,790
Rym: There were those punk kids who gave us pogs because we were so awesome.

478
00:31:12,011 --> 00:31:13,477
Scott: Well, those were crazy pog kids.

479
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:14,421
Scott: We'll talk about Thursday.

480
00:31:14,743 --> 00:31:18,317
Rym: Yeah, I think we will because that's under the Boardwalk hacking episode.

481
00:31:18,438 --> 00:31:29,044
Rym: Yeah, but when it comes to air hockey specifically I don't think anyone in the world except maybe like the master air hockey players We obviously don't run into in our travels could beat either of us.

482
00:31:29,064 --> 00:31:30,550
Rym: The only people who can beat us are each other.

483
00:31:30,811 --> 00:31:33,200
Scott: I think that that's a great exaggeration.

484
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,870
Rym: Well, the thing is I want someone to challenge us and beat us.

485
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:42,010
Scott: I think is that we're better than average people at air hockey But people who are actually good at air hockey would kick our ass.

486
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,515
Rym: But is anyone actually good?

487
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:48,070
Rym: all of the air hockey leagues I found are completely dead or just completely terrible.

488
00:31:48,432 --> 00:31:56,970
Scott: I think that there are people who are actually good at air hockey like, you know Hit the puck over to them and then they hit it and it comes right at your goal every single time.

489
00:31:57,512 --> 00:32:09,930
Rym: The thing is I remember specifically we were like we played against each other a bunch of times and pretty much played to his tail Mate, and then our friend Katsu was like, hey I'll play with you guys and he played against Scott and Scott just kind of beat him into the ground without even blinking

490
00:32:10,131 --> 00:32:10,332
Scott: Mm-hmm,

491
00:32:10,955 --> 00:32:14,250
Rym: and then I played against him and I beat him into the ground without even blinking.

492
00:32:14,471 --> 00:32:21,321
Scott: Well, it's like this right if you go to a baseball game Is the star of the team and he's just amazing.

493
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:27,400
Scott: and there's the people who were like the bench warmers now The bench warmer in Major League Baseball.

494
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:36,730
Scott: while he may suck in terms of Major League Baseball He could beat the shit out of anyone in the stands in baseball at hands down with no without effort at all.

495
00:32:37,932 --> 00:32:40,709
Scott: But you know, they're the real players out there.

496
00:32:40,951 --> 00:32:44,743
Scott: The thing is we haven't encountered any real players because they're rare.

497
00:32:44,923 --> 00:32:46,147
Rym: So here's here's what I'll do.

498
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:46,870
Rym: I got an idea.

499
00:32:47,691 --> 00:32:49,357
Rym: We've tossed around the idea a lot of.

500
00:32:49,698 --> 00:32:54,639
Rym: if someone is so deserving of awesome someone so incredible We would night them.

501
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:56,270
Rym: we would make them a GeekNights.

502
00:32:57,134 --> 00:33:00,009
Rym: You know get geek naked kind of a play on words there.

503
00:33:00,932 --> 00:33:10,684
Rym: so I will say now that if anyone out there can challenge either of us to air hockey and Beat us in a two out of three match.

504
00:33:10,965 --> 00:33:14,040
Scott: Well, I don't think Beating us is just enough.

505
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,130
Scott: It's like you have to completely dominate us.

506
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:19,362
Scott: I mean if you're on our level, it's like okay, you're on our level.

507
00:33:19,382 --> 00:33:21,290
Scott: You have to be above us.

508
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:23,068
Rym: Yeah, they could beat both of us.

509
00:33:24,352 --> 00:33:25,698
Rym: You know two out of three match cuz.

510
00:33:25,739 --> 00:33:27,890
Rym: then at that point they're at least better than yeah.

511
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:31,464
Scott: It's like if you're also a bench warmer in the major leagues like we are.

512
00:33:31,525 --> 00:33:33,677
Scott: that's like, okay, you're cool But you're not.

513
00:33:33,858 --> 00:33:35,209
Scott: you know more awesome than us.

514
00:33:35,551 --> 00:33:39,630
Scott: You have to be like get to beat the shit out of us at air hockey like we can't beat you.

515
00:33:39,931 --> 00:33:44,268
Rym: Yeah, I don't know how we'll pull this off because there aren't so many good regulation air hockey tables about.

516
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:44,952
Scott: no There aren't.

517
00:33:44,972 --> 00:33:47,349
Scott: a lot of times you go to an arcade and they have that stupid table that goes.

518
00:33:49,291 --> 00:33:50,355
Scott: It's not a real table.

519
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:52,564
Scott: the real tables are from dynamo.

520
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:54,150
Rym: Yeah, we want a photon table.

521
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:58,450
Scott: There's photon and they make a few other tables that are official real tables.

522
00:33:59,034 --> 00:34:05,050
Scott: No other company makes real air hockey tables And the thing is the real tables are only like two or three thousand dollars.

523
00:34:05,533 --> 00:34:08,510
Scott: The freight shipping is what kills you because those things are fucking heavy.

524
00:34:08,731 --> 00:34:13,389
Rym: Yeah, though the thing is if we ever get a house with a basement, we're probably going to buy a regulation air hockey.

525
00:34:13,931 --> 00:34:16,641
Scott: It's gonna take a lot of effort to stop me from buying a regular.

526
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:17,946
Rym: good God good God.

527
00:34:18,547 --> 00:34:19,030
Rym: and you know what?

528
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,081
Rym: We'll play whatever style you play.

529
00:34:21,181 --> 00:34:22,208
Rym: clap or no clap.

530
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:24,657
Scott: Yeah If you don't know clap is.

531
00:34:24,978 --> 00:34:30,536
Scott: some people play air hockey where you can take the little The puck the the shuffler the thing.

532
00:34:30,577 --> 00:34:36,317
Scott: you hit the paddle the paddle and you can slam it down on top of the puck to Stop it in its tracks.

533
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:38,768
Scott: and some people say no you can't do that.

534
00:34:40,072 --> 00:34:43,989
Rym: It seemed at least where I grew up everyone played clap or they can just pick the thing up all the time.

535
00:34:44,292 --> 00:34:46,030
Scott: Where I grew up no one ever did that.

536
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:47,297
Scott: It was like you can't do that.

537
00:34:47,378 --> 00:34:52,429
Rym: and then yeah and some looking around online Seemed to determine that it really depends on where you grew up how you play.

538
00:34:52,871 --> 00:34:55,989
Rym: Yeah, and all the league seemed to play no clap with a couple exceptions.

539
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,315
Rym: So what we can do?

540
00:34:57,355 --> 00:34:57,576
Rym: both?

541
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:58,841
Rym: we both learn both ways.

542
00:34:58,922 --> 00:35:00,950
Rym: I taught Scott the clap and he taught me the non clap.

543
00:35:01,191 --> 00:35:03,043
Rym: Yep, and then I gave Scott the clap.

544
00:35:03,204 --> 00:35:10,300
Rym: Yeah All Right, that was a super inside joke.

545
00:35:12,661 --> 00:35:15,496
Rym: Yeah, we'll save that for an episode on RIT.

546
00:35:15,576 --> 00:35:18,704
Scott: All right What are the gaming?

547
00:35:18,725 --> 00:35:25,192
Scott: - oh well at the Shore house, we also played a bunch of GameCube games Yes, including that x-men gauntlet game.

548
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:25,795
Scott: Oh god.

549
00:35:25,815 --> 00:35:26,598
Scott: Oh god.

550
00:35:26,618 --> 00:35:29,669
Scott: All right Let's talk about the other games first cuz that one was so bad.

551
00:35:29,809 --> 00:35:30,793
Rym: Did we play anything else?

552
00:35:31,255 --> 00:35:33,880
Scott: I played a little bit of Rampart.

553
00:35:34,661 --> 00:35:35,143
Rym: No, we didn't.

554
00:35:35,504 --> 00:35:43,580
Rym: Oh, you didn't play but I know cuz you know what the one day in between the two days of DDR When I went to play DDR you guys all stayed in the house and played GameCube games.

555
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:47,190
Scott: I played rampart surround castle to stay alive.

556
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:56,383
Scott: Good job red commander, and I played a bit of sinister run coward and I played a bit of What do we play?

557
00:35:56,403 --> 00:35:57,588
Scott: we played that Star Wars game?

558
00:35:58,251 --> 00:35:59,597
Rym: Oh, yeah, you guys all played that.

559
00:35:59,677 --> 00:36:00,320
Rym: I hate that game.

560
00:36:00,882 --> 00:36:01,665
Scott: It wasn't so good.

561
00:36:01,685 --> 00:36:03,492
Rym: I mean it seems really cool.

562
00:36:03,572 --> 00:36:06,243
Scott: if it was the only space shooter in the world It would be great.

563
00:36:06,303 --> 00:36:08,672
Scott: But the fact that TIE fighter exists means the game is crap.

564
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,760
Rym: I've ever came out over a decade ago.

565
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:14,893
Scott: I know that no one has made a better free space combat game.

566
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:20,357
Scott: That's well, that's why it said well descent is okay And free space is okay, but they're not as good though.

567
00:36:20,377 --> 00:36:22,505
Rym: I mean, yeah No, I don't think so.

568
00:36:22,565 --> 00:36:23,188
Rym: Yeah.

569
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:26,258
Rym: Well, all right, then maybe it's not TIE fighter and it's like a lion.

570
00:36:27,122 --> 00:36:29,436
Rym: X-wing alliance, however is essentially the same game.

571
00:36:29,476 --> 00:36:35,180
Scott: just that up I'm not saying you're saying like, you know, the x-wing alliance is like the best and everything else sucks.

572
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:42,340
Scott: I'm saying this descent this free space and there's the x-wing TIE fighter series and there aren't any others like wing commander.

573
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,081
Scott: Fuck that shit.

574
00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:43,622
Scott: That's crap.

575
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:46,066
Rym: Well, when was the last time a free space game?

576
00:36:46,107 --> 00:36:50,224
Rym: That was actually free space came out Descent three.

577
00:36:50,566 --> 00:36:51,530
Rym: when did that come out?

578
00:36:54,737 --> 00:36:56,654
Rym: Yeah Last millennia.

579
00:36:56,914 --> 00:37:03,150
Rym: all I remember is that when I bought my sound card it came with descent 3 as a free gift.

580
00:37:03,531 --> 00:37:07,062
Scott: Yep, I bought descent 3 in the box and it was around the time.

581
00:37:07,102 --> 00:37:08,206
Scott: I got my new computer.

582
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:14,553
Scott: Well my Pentium 3 Which was 1999 or 2000 so free.

583
00:37:14,614 --> 00:37:21,325
Scott: I remember there being free space 1 free space 2 which were sort of like Descent but out in outer space instead of in a planet.

584
00:37:21,707 --> 00:37:24,867
Rym: Yeah Plus TIE fighter had that plot going for it.

585
00:37:25,128 --> 00:37:26,874
Scott: Yeah Descent had a plot.

586
00:37:27,576 --> 00:37:28,941
Rym: Yeah, x-wing alliance has a plot.

587
00:37:29,002 --> 00:37:29,764
Scott: Free space had a plot.

588
00:37:29,825 --> 00:37:31,210
Scott: if I remember I only played the demo.

589
00:37:31,252 --> 00:37:36,630
Rym: Yeah The problem with x-wing alliance was I didn't care at all about the plot because it had nothing to do with the Star Wars universe.

590
00:37:36,811 --> 00:37:39,118
Rym: It was mostly just OMG pirates.

591
00:37:39,178 --> 00:37:45,650
Scott: I think the real reason those games died is because joysticks died, you know Yeah, I mean you can't buy a good joystick anymore.

592
00:37:46,011 --> 00:37:52,190
Scott: It's really like it's weird because the first-person shooter is pretty much it destroyed those games and not anything else.

593
00:37:52,250 --> 00:38:03,590
Rym: You know, I mean back in the day for 70 bucks I bought a flight stick Pro and it was this heavy Really really durable really well constructed hard joystick and it was awesome.

594
00:38:04,712 --> 00:38:07,190
Rym: Now I go to any you know computer store.

595
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:12,590
Rym: There's not a single joystick that even comes close to the durability or the functionality of that thing.

596
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:16,280
Scott: Logitech's got a few and what's the other company?

597
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,625
Rym: but they still feel flimsy.

598
00:38:17,725 --> 00:38:19,090
Scott: they do they all feel flimsy.

599
00:38:19,251 --> 00:38:20,516
Rym: They just they don't resist me.

600
00:38:20,596 --> 00:38:23,026
Rym: The force feedback is usually negligible or broken.

601
00:38:23,368 --> 00:38:25,313
Scott: Yeah What was the?

602
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:26,297
Scott: let's see like sci-tech?

603
00:38:26,618 --> 00:38:29,370
Scott: sci-tech makes the other ones the ones with all the million buttons.

604
00:38:29,653 --> 00:38:37,990
Scott: Yeah, the buttons that break immediately Yes, I take used to make a really awesome ones But now they make these like things out of cheap plastic that just break all over the place.

605
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:40,729
Scott: And the other thing is, you know, the demand for joysticks is down.

606
00:38:41,293 --> 00:38:46,918
Scott: So the demand for those games is down and vice versa, you know It's just like these two things dragging each other down.

607
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,347
Scott: one of them needs to be boosted to boost the other one.

608
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:50,973
Rym: Oh Well, yep.

609
00:38:51,073 --> 00:39:02,690
Rym: I also played two quick two games worth of House of the Dead for Yeah, I played one game of it and I gotta say I found the game really really fun and really really easy.

610
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:05,670
Scott: Yeah, it's surprisingly you don't die so much.

611
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:08,810
Scott: I don't know if they had the machine set on easy because not a lot of people were playing it.

612
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:15,321
Rym: So maybe they set it on easy to get more quarters in Yep Or maybe it might just be that the game really really rewards you.

613
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:22,650
Rym: if you're a good shot and you know anything about zombies Pretty much headshots win the day all the time with few exceptions.

614
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:23,472
Rym: And what yep?

615
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:30,156
Rym: aim for the head and sweep or aim for the explosive thing that the zombie is carrying or aim for the explosive Thing.

616
00:39:30,176 --> 00:39:31,571
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty much you know You.

617
00:39:31,913 --> 00:39:34,645
Scott: a new kind of monster appears and you have to figure out where to shoot.

618
00:39:34,785 --> 00:39:41,885
Rym: and if you keep you know Doing the smart thing you keep going and the boss fights are pretty much hit the target enough before it damages you.

619
00:39:42,166 --> 00:39:42,347
Scott: Yep.

620
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:44,914
Scott: Oh Well, it was fun.

621
00:39:45,134 --> 00:39:47,742
Rym: Yeah, I played another round of time crisis for some

622
00:39:47,903 --> 00:39:49,026
Scott: rounds of time crisis for

623
00:39:49,046 --> 00:39:52,379
Rym: I think it's my favorite time Crisis, but I haven't played it enough to be sure

624
00:39:52,399 --> 00:39:55,874
Scott: crisis 2 is still my favorite one But I

625
00:39:56,275 --> 00:39:56,777
Rym: like the time

626
00:39:56,797 --> 00:40:00,370
Scott: crisis 4 is just I think more of time crisis 3 with some extra good.

627
00:40:00,451 --> 00:40:03,490
Rym: I just really like the fact that you use all the weapons a lot more.

628
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:05,639
Rym: You don't feel bad about wasting the ammo at all.

629
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:14,633
Scott: Yeah, I just still time crisis 2 though Just the setup of that game and the levels and the fact that it was the first one to have the two players and the Two screens.

630
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:23,425
Rym: Well, I was gonna beat time crisis 4 but then when I finally went over to display it One of the sides was broken and I didn't want to go to another arcades.

631
00:40:23,465 --> 00:40:24,490
Rym: That was the end of that pipe dream.

632
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:27,343
Scott: Yeah, you can never play that game with a broken gun.

633
00:40:27,483 --> 00:40:28,870
Scott: It's like forget it not even worth it.

634
00:40:29,533 --> 00:40:30,497
Rym: At least they taped it off.

635
00:40:30,537 --> 00:40:31,281
Rym: It was completely.

636
00:40:31,361 --> 00:40:32,627
Rym: you couldn't use that side of the game.

637
00:40:32,647 --> 00:40:36,223
Scott: Okay I guess it but it's no point in beating the game one player.

638
00:40:36,283 --> 00:40:37,166
Scott: That's even stupider.

639
00:40:37,327 --> 00:40:37,849
Rym: Yeah, just not fun.

640
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:38,994
Rym: You gotta yell at someone.

641
00:40:39,135 --> 00:40:40,400
Scott: see what they really should have done.

642
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,003
Scott: is they should at?

643
00:40:41,043 --> 00:40:42,328
Scott: they should make a time crisis.

644
00:40:42,469 --> 00:40:42,690
Scott: where?

645
00:40:43,491 --> 00:40:43,974
Scott: It's for.

646
00:40:44,054 --> 00:40:46,288
Scott: it's a four seater and it's two on two.

647
00:40:47,493 --> 00:40:48,647
Rym: That could be really interesting.

648
00:40:48,727 --> 00:40:59,159
Rym: Oh, yeah That's what they got to do like those Japanese arcade machines where instead of standing side by side It's like it everyone faces each other in the games in the middle So you can't see the other person's screens or anything exactly.

649
00:40:59,199 --> 00:40:59,621
Scott: my point.

650
00:41:00,464 --> 00:41:00,865
Rym: You know what?

651
00:41:00,905 --> 00:41:02,270
Rym: We just need Japanese arcades.

652
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:05,041
Rym: Exactly, that would make me the happiest man in the world.

653
00:41:05,302 --> 00:41:07,290
Scott: All right, so let's talk about the x-men crap game.

654
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:09,578
Rym: All right, it's pretty much gauntlet.

655
00:41:09,899 --> 00:41:11,143
Rym: only you are x-men.

656
00:41:11,545 --> 00:41:13,070
Rym: Yeah, we play have a cool game.

657
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:16,530
Scott: We played was x-men legends 2 and it's gauntlet.

658
00:41:17,012 --> 00:41:17,132
Scott: It's.

659
00:41:17,373 --> 00:41:22,569
Scott: you walk around and all you do is hold down a button and all the bad guys die and numbers go up.

660
00:41:23,034 --> 00:41:28,707
Scott: now the game has numbers go up you get more powers and all that means is you hold down the button and different shit happens.

661
00:41:28,747 --> 00:41:39,530
Rym: the game has this Leveling aspect and you can do it manually where you pick all these powers and there's this really cool stuff That really doesn't matter at all and it would appeal to me a lot more if I were ten years younger.

662
00:41:39,701 --> 00:41:47,091
Scott: Yeah It's like you can choose which mutant powers you level up over time and it's all complicated as a crazy system and you can min max it.

663
00:41:47,534 --> 00:41:54,308
Scott: the thing is it doesn't matter which mutant power you pick because They all work equally well at killing bad guys.

664
00:41:54,488 --> 00:42:06,810
Scott: So Except for things like, you know building bridges and flying over stuff Which you can do when you're level one if you choose the right mutant It really doesn't matter which mutant you pick or what powers you use.

665
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:12,448
Scott: so we just chose automatic everything and all the bad guys just got the shit kicked out of them and everything was easy.

666
00:42:12,468 --> 00:42:15,890
Scott: and All we did was walk around holding a button down and bad guys died.

667
00:42:16,011 --> 00:42:16,835
Rym: As far as I could tell.

668
00:42:16,876 --> 00:42:22,467
Rym: the only joy the game offers that if you are nightcrawler You can grab someone and then BAMF off of a cliff with them.

669
00:42:22,709 --> 00:42:26,870
Rym: Yep Or Scott Johnson can just walk off of a cliff and die.

670
00:42:27,552 --> 00:42:35,689
Scott: I say the game is slightly better than World of Warcraft, but only slightly and that you're actually kind of I don't know Walking around pushing a button.

671
00:42:36,352 --> 00:42:43,468
Rym: I'd say it's at least twice as good as gauntlet legends only in that there are more Buttons to push and more things to bump into.

672
00:42:43,629 --> 00:42:43,810
Rym: yeah

673
00:42:44,232 --> 00:42:50,814
Scott: And I'd say it's less than city of heroes because city of heroes is kind of like PvP online X-men legends -

674
00:42:51,095 --> 00:42:51,316
Rym: yeah,

675
00:42:52,018 --> 00:43:02,330
Scott: so yeah X-men legends - if you like looking at x-men Here's a game you should play If you like just holding a button down not thinking and and seeing the end of the game.

676
00:43:02,673 --> 00:43:03,807
Scott: It's also a game you should play.

677
00:43:04,612 --> 00:43:04,712
Rym: Now.

678
00:43:04,772 --> 00:43:10,130
Rym: it might seem like we have cut short on the Otakon and Wildwood and week of awesome coverage thus far.

679
00:43:10,773 --> 00:43:13,709
Rym: And I say to you now tomorrow is the day.

680
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:16,799
Rym: Tomorrow is our full coverage of Otakon.

681
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,426
Scott: Did we played a few more games didn't we?

682
00:43:18,727 --> 00:43:19,188
Rym: Not really?

683
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:20,856
Rym: No We didn't lay any board games.

684
00:43:21,218 --> 00:43:23,790
Scott: We played some Mario soccer, but we did a whole episode on that.

685
00:43:23,931 --> 00:43:25,120
Rym: Yeah, we didn't play that much of it.

686
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,490
Scott: I'm better at Mario soccer now.

687
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,023
Scott: I can actually beat the game on the second difficulty level.

688
00:43:29,183 --> 00:43:30,490
Rym: Yeah, I gotta start playing the one player.

689
00:43:30,893 --> 00:43:37,550
Rym: Yep, the third difficulty level still gets me though But tomorrow we'll have the full coverage of Otakon with all the interviews and everything.

690
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:40,250
Rym: Thursday is going to be a big episode.

691
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:45,150
Rym: We'll have our full coverage of some things we did in Wildwood, New Jersey.

692
00:43:46,311 --> 00:43:50,463
Rym: I don't want to be more specific than that because good God, this is hilarious and awesome.

693
00:43:51,025 --> 00:43:54,512
Scott: Oh, I mean I see trouble This way.

694
00:43:54,532 --> 00:43:56,177
Rym: Yeah, we caused some trouble.

695
00:43:56,718 --> 00:43:59,286
Rym: We sure did and we have pictures of the trouble being caused.

696
00:43:59,767 --> 00:44:00,308
Scott: Oh, do we?

697
00:44:00,328 --> 00:44:00,369
Scott: we?

698
00:44:01,891 --> 00:44:02,052
Rym: It's.

699
00:44:02,415 --> 00:44:04,650
Rym: it's been trying to get out of me for the last two weeks.

700
00:44:05,152 --> 00:44:11,548
Rym: I can't wait to tell all of our listeners what we did in great excruciating detail All righty.

701
00:44:12,533 --> 00:44:22,610
Rym: So without further ado here are some interviews I did at Otakon with people I found who had PSPs and Stay tuned tomorrow for the Otakon coverage that I know many of you new listeners are really really waiting for.

702
00:44:23,571 --> 00:44:30,330
Rym: All right, we're here in the pre-reg line for Otakon and for the first time in a long time We've seen a PSP at an anime convention.

703
00:44:31,552 --> 00:44:32,741
Rym: So what do you think of the PSP?

704
00:44:33,486 --> 00:44:34,030
Rym: It's all right.

705
00:44:34,231 --> 00:44:38,310
Rym: It's not as good as the DS really but I mean it's got a lot of cool features.

706
00:44:38,632 --> 00:44:41,970
Rym: It's a shame though because the US doesn't really see a lot of good games releases.

707
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,425
Rym: I mean a lot of it like.

708
00:44:44,767 --> 00:44:48,564
Scott: I know PSP max portable for the it's Korean game.

709
00:44:48,584 --> 00:44:49,869
Rym: It's supposed to be pretty cool.

710
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:55,770
Rym: I know loco roko is already out in Japan and China and everywhere else except for the US.

711
00:44:56,335 --> 00:44:56,739
Rym: So I take it.

712
00:44:56,759 --> 00:44:57,870
Rym: you got a DS and a PSP.

713
00:44:58,631 --> 00:45:00,921
Rym: No, no, it's just what a lot of seen with the DS.

714
00:45:00,961 --> 00:45:02,850
Rym: I mean Nintendo is great for the platforming.

715
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:06,110
Rym: I mean they put out a lot of great stuff and then they put out bad stuff.

716
00:45:06,331 --> 00:45:08,989
Rym: But I mean, there's a lot of great stuff to esteem themselves very high.

717
00:45:09,931 --> 00:45:13,370
Rym: Yeah, so when you come to cons with the PSP, do you bring it whenever you go to a convention?

718
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:14,934
Scott: No, not really.

719
00:45:14,974 --> 00:45:17,750
Scott: I just brought it because I thought I was gonna listen to music and everything.

720
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:20,306
Rym: But I'm here with some friends.

721
00:45:20,347 --> 00:45:22,234
Rym: So Not something.

722
00:45:22,254 --> 00:45:24,143
Rym: I was about to leave at home.

723
00:45:24,485 --> 00:45:28,222
Rym: friend took it All right, so I'm here with another person with a PSP.

724
00:45:28,242 --> 00:45:30,250
Rym: This is a record for me seeing two at a con.

725
00:45:31,611 --> 00:45:33,443
Rym: So yeah, I have a ds2 or just a PSP.

726
00:45:33,705 --> 00:45:34,429
Scott: I just have a PSP.

727
00:45:34,892 --> 00:45:38,090
Rym: I mean, it's a good system, but are there any good games for it now that you're playing?

728
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:41,363
Scott: I'm only play like only God because a lot of her friends at work at

729
00:45:41,423 --> 00:45:42,830
Rym: it and we were playing like a lot of like

730
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:48,113
Scott: Liberty City stories the multiplayer because it was fun because you know the guys sitting right across from you can laugh at him After you

731
00:45:48,133 --> 00:45:50,505
Rym: put him down, so do you come so often?

732
00:45:50,525 --> 00:45:51,510
Rym: Do you bring the PSP with you?

733
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:54,684
Scott: Um, this is the only one and only conduct I actually go to and I this.

734
00:45:54,906 --> 00:45:57,968
Scott: I brought this the first year I had it so I brought it with me just in case.

735
00:45:58,351 --> 00:46:07,350
Rym: Aha, so if you ever seen a crowd of people at like a convention spontaneously playing PSP games Not really because it's like you're either walking to go to like a panel or you're doing something else.

736
00:46:08,691 --> 00:46:10,176
Rym: Now how long you been standing in line here?

737
00:46:10,237 --> 00:46:17,077
