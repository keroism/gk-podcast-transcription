1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,083
Scott: It's Tuesday March 14th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,123 --> 00:00:15,410
Scott: We talk about our favorite video game.

3
00:00:17,112 --> 00:00:18,106
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:18,913 --> 00:00:24,984
Rym: Well, if you can hear this that means that libsyn is yet again working Adequately, I suppose it's

5
00:00:25,044 --> 00:00:35,530
Scott: quite surprising That you know there's so many people in the forums at libsyn having trouble that it would make you believe Going there that libsyn is super broken, but really all the users are just super stupid.

6
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:41,090
Rym: I mean there were a lot of problems with libsyn recently that they've also apparently recently resolved.

7
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:49,050
Scott: Yeah, but still the amount the sheer numbers of people who did not know what the hell they were doing is near staggering.

8
00:00:49,793 --> 00:01:01,928
Rym: Well, I think the main problem is that libsyn really doesn't offer any documentation whatsoever and The only support there is is hidden in their forums contributed by I guess their employees.

9
00:01:01,968 --> 00:01:02,650
Rym: I'm really not sure.

10
00:01:02,951 --> 00:01:04,155
Scott: Well, they have this there.

11
00:01:04,175 --> 00:01:04,394
Rym: you.

12
00:01:04,536 --> 00:01:07,465
Scott: libsyn is using this business model that I learned about recently.

13
00:01:07,806 --> 00:01:08,829
Scott: It's known as the.

14
00:01:10,311 --> 00:01:11,817
Scott: It's the gym membership model.

15
00:01:11,837 --> 00:01:21,090
Scott: what you do is you get a whole bunch of people to join and pay money But then only a small portion of those people actually take advantage of these services that you have sold them.

16
00:01:21,371 --> 00:01:26,638
Scott: It's like if everyone who had a membership to like Gold's gym Actually showed up to work out.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,169
Scott: They'd be out of business so fast you wouldn't even know what to do.

18
00:01:29,872 --> 00:01:37,609
Rym: You know the fact that only like they count on the fat guy who has a New Year's resolution Gets a year membership and then doesn't come back after March.

19
00:01:37,991 --> 00:01:44,559
Scott: Yeah, it's like as long as only 20% of the people go they're all set They don't have to make a bigger gym or anything.

20
00:01:45,222 --> 00:01:46,810
Scott: So libsyn is doing the same thing.

21
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,561
Scott: They're hoping all these people will pay money.

22
00:01:48,802 --> 00:01:50,030
Rym: Well, at least that's what you're assuming.

23
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:52,564
Scott: Yeah, that's that's the only way they could be making money off of this.

24
00:01:52,604 --> 00:01:53,750
Scott: giving you infinite bandwidth.

25
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:56,565
Rym: Come on infinite bandwidth isn't really that expensive.

26
00:01:56,645 --> 00:01:57,550
Scott: It's pretty expensive.

27
00:01:58,052 --> 00:02:07,290
Scott: What they do is they have a whole bunch of people who either you know say they're gonna do X podcast But do much fewer or they have many very much fewer listeners.

28
00:02:08,213 --> 00:02:12,670
Scott: Or they have people who sign up and don't actually podcast at all or stop podcasting.

29
00:02:13,391 --> 00:02:16,123
Rym: And well, you stop podcasting you stop paying almost immediately.

30
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:21,910
Rym: if you're smart enough to stop paying It's real hard to accidentally continue to pay because it's PayPal.

31
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:25,570
Scott: Alright, but doesn't it just automatically subtract everything?

32
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,981
Rym: Yeah, no one's gonna leave libsyn going if they don't have a podcast.

33
00:02:29,021 --> 00:02:31,650
Scott: people leave MMOs going and they don't know.

34
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,281
Rym: No people leave MMOs going because they don't want to lose their character.

35
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:35,325
Rym: if they ever want to play again.

36
00:02:35,385 --> 00:02:36,650
Scott: people leave libsyn going Cuz.

37
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,874
Scott: they don't lose their podcast.

38
00:02:38,295 --> 00:02:39,238
Rym: I really doubt that.

39
00:02:39,258 --> 00:02:43,070
Rym: I don't think that that's a significant number at all of their membership.

40
00:02:43,732 --> 00:02:44,074
Scott: I don't know.

41
00:02:44,256 --> 00:02:45,162
Scott: These people are so dumb.

42
00:02:45,182 --> 00:02:46,289
Scott: They don't even know how to use the thing.

43
00:02:46,796 --> 00:02:47,830
Rym: I didn't even know how to use it.

44
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,930
Rym: I had to read this forum post to try to guess at how half the libsyn crap works.

45
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:54,060
Rym: Well, okay, they don't document it at all.

46
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:58,520
Rym: You click upload you upload it Yeah, and they have all this other stuff like.

47
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:01,721
Rym: I had to go in and find the crap web page They made for us and get rid of it.

48
00:03:01,761 --> 00:03:04,450
Rym: So no one got confused All right.

49
00:03:04,553 --> 00:03:07,737
Scott: But anyway That's how they're making money is a whole day.

50
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:13,022
Scott: a few people are using it a whole lot and using a ton of bandwidth and they're Being supported by the people who aren't using so much.

51
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:14,550
Rym: Yeah, well at least that's your assumption.

52
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,414
Rym: We don't really know.

53
00:03:15,434 --> 00:03:16,922
Rym: I mean, we don't know what their books look like.

54
00:03:17,143 --> 00:03:22,225
Scott: if they're not doing it that way I can't imagine a way they are doing it and unless there's some secret to it.

55
00:03:22,306 --> 00:03:23,330
Scott: They're gonna be out of business.

56
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:26,501
Rym: I think very simply not that many people listen to podcasts.

57
00:03:26,521 --> 00:03:28,067
Rym: So it's really not that much bandwidth.

58
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:31,865
Scott: all told no They were using what was it like terabytes a day.

59
00:03:31,905 --> 00:03:35,539
Rym: I think they said yeah Yeah, whatever penny arcade gets two million unique hits a day.

60
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,883
Scott: Yeah for an image.

61
00:03:37,325 --> 00:03:41,257
Scott: Yeah, we're talking about like Zillions of mp3 minutes.

62
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,201
Rym: Yeah.

63
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:43,526
Rym: I just don't think it's really that much.

64
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:45,729
Scott: all things considered It's quite a lot.

65
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:48,516
Scott: You don't seem to understand these.

66
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:51,325
Rym: No, I just don't think that many people listen to podcasts yet.

67
00:03:51,747 --> 00:03:52,991
Scott: No, they really do Do you?

68
00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:54,738
Scott: I need to play for you the podcast they were.

69
00:03:54,778 --> 00:03:57,249
Scott: they interview the Libsyn guy and ask him how it's going.

70
00:03:57,754 --> 00:04:00,674
Scott: It's crazy Absolutely crazy.

71
00:04:00,694 --> 00:04:02,622
Rym: All right, whatever the point is we're on Libsyn now.

72
00:04:02,964 --> 00:04:03,144
Rym: Yep.

73
00:04:03,325 --> 00:04:13,370
Rym: Anyway in the news You know Sony had their dual shock patent dispute where this company called immersion For those of you who aren't familiar with this basically had a patent on.

74
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:20,649
Rym: Now this is gonna sound stupid but rumble packs at least in terms of console game controllers work all the same way.

75
00:04:21,031 --> 00:04:24,090
Rym: They have an unbalanced weight and you spin it to make a rumbling effect.

76
00:04:24,271 --> 00:04:26,530
Scott: Well, how come they're not going after a Nintendo or anyone?

77
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,472
Rym: I was about to get to that.

78
00:04:27,713 --> 00:04:33,170
Rym: this patent specifically covers having two of these devices in a controller hence dual shock.

79
00:04:34,015 --> 00:04:34,720
Scott: Oh, I didn't realize.

80
00:04:34,761 --> 00:04:36,070
Scott: the dual shock had two rumbles.

81
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:40,068
Scott: I thought it was called the dual shock because it had the two analog sticks and it had a rumble.

82
00:04:40,349 --> 00:04:48,790
Rym: now It had two rumbles that were identical And X Microsoft used the same thing in the Xbox and they settled quietly out of court.

83
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:54,327
Rym: Sony tried to fight it lost appealed and just recently lost the appeal.

84
00:04:54,347 --> 00:04:58,089
Rym: Oh They're gonna have to pay at least eighty two million dollars to the company.

85
00:04:58,311 --> 00:05:01,408
Scott: Yeah They make a lot of freaking money off of those controllers.

86
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:07,870
Rym: now Nintendo only has one gyro in there because they knew about the patent and they didn't want to infringe on it.

87
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,152
Scott: You know what?

88
00:05:08,172 --> 00:05:09,138
Rym: I gotta say for it.

89
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:11,070
Scott: I don't see how to is that much better than one?

90
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:17,790
Scott: I mean is better is two more than it for the small effect that the rumble actually gives in a game at all.

91
00:05:18,212 --> 00:05:22,130
Scott: You know the the one rumble in the GameCube controller is just fine.

92
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:27,030
Rym: I think the point was that if you have two rumbles you could control them separately and have different effects.

93
00:05:27,951 --> 00:05:33,910
Scott: Maybe but I don't really feel like I'm missing out on anything then what we're really missing out on is force feedback.

94
00:05:34,071 --> 00:05:39,770
Scott: You know why there's no force feedback controllers anymore because there's a patent and that company isn't licensing it or anything.

95
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:45,485
Rym: Well, also the fact that support for force feedback was varied and marginal at best.

96
00:05:45,585 --> 00:05:46,227
Scott: Well, they were going.

97
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:47,270
Scott: they were on the verge.

98
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,454
Scott: They were making a standard.

99
00:05:48,494 --> 00:05:51,325
Scott: they had a standard actually for how force feedback should work.

100
00:05:51,365 --> 00:05:52,730
Scott: It was in DirectX and everything.

101
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,941
Scott: Yeah, but then these patent holding bastards messed up the whole thing.

102
00:05:55,961 --> 00:05:58,148
Scott: So now there's no force feedback joysticks or anything.

103
00:05:58,329 --> 00:05:58,710
Rym: That's fine.

104
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,582
Rym: There's no joysticks.

105
00:05:59,846 --> 00:06:03,650
Rym: Yeah There's no PC games that need good joysticks.

106
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,530
Rym: There's no good joysticks.

107
00:06:04,991 --> 00:06:05,774
Rym: Force feedback doesn't.

108
00:06:05,854 --> 00:06:14,736
Scott: but there is evidence to suggest that if they had to force feedback and went through they would have made because Microsoft Was making the joysticks with force feedback Would have made the games for.

109
00:06:14,796 --> 00:06:18,630
Rym: and somehow I don't think force feedback was gonna save the PC gaming industry.

110
00:06:18,751 --> 00:06:24,200
Scott: I wasn't gonna say the PC gaming industry, but it would have saved joysticks I don't think it would have because there still wouldn't have at a market.

111
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,349
Rym: I mean how many people buy joysticks now?

112
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,297
Scott: No one cuz they don't sell them.

113
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,405
Rym: No, they sell them.

114
00:06:29,425 --> 00:06:29,888
Rym: They're out there.

115
00:06:30,412 --> 00:06:32,706
Rym: I bought one a while ago so I could play x-wing Alliance.

116
00:06:33,108 --> 00:06:37,475
Scott: awesome Yeah, but anyway it would as they would have helped Something.

117
00:06:37,857 --> 00:06:40,070
Rym: nah, I think it was too little too late.

118
00:06:40,572 --> 00:06:44,429
Rym: The problem was is that we I mean, you know, I could sit in the bottom of the Titanic with a bucket.

119
00:06:45,212 --> 00:06:45,332
Scott: See.

120
00:06:45,352 --> 00:06:50,630
Scott: the other problem is that all the force feedback you've ever experienced is the shitty kind because the good kind is super patented.

121
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:53,936
Rym: Oh, I didn't say force feedback was bad I just said that's definitely not.

122
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:58,957
Rym: that wasn't gonna help the PC gaming industry and no Force feedback would have been.

123
00:06:58,977 --> 00:07:01,530
Rym: it still would have gone away because there aren't any games.

124
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:04,019
Scott: There would have been games if there was force feedback.

125
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:04,942
Scott: that was so quality.

126
00:07:04,982 --> 00:07:08,581
Scott: people would have made games just to use that and sell It based on that gimmick alone.

127
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:11,658
Scott: Yeah It's like there was.

128
00:07:11,718 --> 00:07:14,750
Scott: no there aren't any touchscreen games and now this is touch screen.

129
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,136
Scott: So now this touchscreen games.

130
00:07:16,558 --> 00:07:18,950
Scott: well there weren't any force feedback joystick games.

131
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,706
Scott: This is no force feedback joystick.

132
00:07:20,726 --> 00:07:32,230
Scott: point out However, that there's a huge huge market for Nintendo DS game But the market did not appear until the DS is made just as the market for force feedback Joysticks would not appear until the joysticks existed.

133
00:07:32,731 --> 00:07:34,016
Scott: You have to make the product first.

134
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,119
Scott: then the market appears.

135
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:40,040
Rym: see the problem is people were moving away from the PC gaming market already And I don't think people were gonna know.

136
00:07:40,141 --> 00:07:41,329
Scott: This is a long time ago.

137
00:07:41,651 --> 00:07:42,273
Rym: Yeah, and you know what?

138
00:07:42,373 --> 00:07:44,300
Rym: PC gaming was in decline a long time ago.

139
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,765
Scott: No, it wasn't in decline.

140
00:07:45,785 --> 00:07:49,159
Scott: This was even before like You came out.

141
00:07:49,522 --> 00:07:50,410
Rym: you're entitled to your opinion.

142
00:07:51,152 --> 00:07:51,594
Scott: It's a fact.

143
00:07:51,634 --> 00:07:56,790
Scott: this was in the olden days and PC gaming was at its peak that the force feedback debacle occurred.

144
00:07:57,117 --> 00:07:57,690
Rym: Yeah, and you know what?

145
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:00,401
Rym: I didn't care about it then and then PC gaming died and I stopped caring.

146
00:08:00,441 --> 00:08:03,278
Scott: you didn't care about him because it was the stupid Dispute.

147
00:08:03,338 --> 00:08:05,030
Scott: Oh my god alright.

148
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,798
Scott: So the whole hubbub on the big the net today.

149
00:08:08,878 --> 00:08:12,670
Scott: Is that Dell may or may not be buying Alienware?

150
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,464
Rym: I haven't heard anything about this and if it's true, I don't care.

151
00:08:15,665 --> 00:08:16,430
Scott: I saw it on my play.

152
00:08:16,691 --> 00:08:18,297
Rym: I don't give a shit song if I had it finished yet.

153
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:21,790
Scott: I saw it on like 10 websites like Dell buys Alienware.

154
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,518
Rym: Question mark, why does anyone even care?

155
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:26,224
Rym: Alienware doesn't make good hardware.

156
00:08:26,525 --> 00:08:28,010
Rym: Dell makes average hardware.

157
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,709
Rym: Alienware isn't special in any way anymore.

158
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,813
Scott: That's exactly the whole story.

159
00:08:33,256 --> 00:08:34,359
Rym: is that so it's not a story.

160
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:40,350
Scott: Well, the story is is that you know people who buy pre-made computers and have too much money.

161
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:47,978
Scott: They don't have to do with all by these Alienware things and all the normal people buy the Dell things and Dell also makes this Like line of gamer computers.

162
00:08:47,998 --> 00:08:57,250
Scott: So now there's people who are like If this really happens then all those Dell gamer computers are gonna be super cheap and we can go scoop them up.

163
00:08:58,678 --> 00:09:00,875
Rym: Yeah Computers are already super cheap.

164
00:09:01,337 --> 00:09:06,071
Rym: Yeah, I mean you can build a tricked-out computer for you know, $400.

165
00:09:06,071 --> 00:09:08,139
Scott: No, these are like the insane Oh computers.

166
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,244
Rym: Oh so useless.

167
00:09:09,505 --> 00:09:10,710
Scott: Well, no not useless.

168
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:19,549
Scott: The fact is what would normally be useless because it's so expensive would become cheap because Dell would just try to get rid of that Computers to put in the new Alienware line.

169
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:23,630
Scott: But we have no idea about if this is true or not.

170
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:31,009
Scott: However, the latest evidence is that you know on to the already existing pile is that Dell has canceled some?

171
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:43,683
Scott: sneak preview press event at the game developers conference, so We'll say That's like the scandest evidence for anything else the game developers conference.

172
00:09:43,743 --> 00:09:44,406
Scott: and it's Dell.

173
00:09:44,466 --> 00:09:45,770
Scott: so Dell makes computers.

174
00:09:45,992 --> 00:09:46,860
Scott: They're gonna talk it again.

175
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:54,563
Rym: developers conference Alienware then Yeah, makes gaming computers, you know, there are very few things in this world.

176
00:09:54,624 --> 00:09:56,610
Rym: I care less about than Alienware or Dell.

177
00:09:57,373 --> 00:10:03,554
Rym: I just care a little bit about Dell because I deal with them on a regular basis, but Alien, yeah I don't really care because it.

178
00:10:04,016 --> 00:10:16,609
Scott: I don't really care because it won't affect me at all because I don't care about Dell or Alienware as far as I'm concerned, but as far as tech in general is is concerned this could cause some Changes like what?

179
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:31,750
Rym: Like you know, yeah, I'm listening Decrease Okay, so suddenly there's a flood of cheap powerful PCs and then that dries up because they're not making them anymore.

180
00:10:32,072 --> 00:10:40,809
Scott: well, no, not that but the fact that Dell buys Alienware and And now I can't think of any ramification that really matters at all.

181
00:10:41,592 --> 00:10:45,927
Scott: All those idiots buying like expensive computers, you know can't buy Alienwares.

182
00:10:45,948 --> 00:10:46,610
Scott: they have to buy Dells.

183
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:47,934
Scott: They might not want to.

184
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:52,309
Scott: they might all buy Dells in you because they're Alienwares, you know things to get weird.

185
00:10:54,091 --> 00:10:56,420
Rym: That doesn't sound so worrisome or weird.

186
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,443
Scott: or maybe they'll be all.

187
00:10:57,543 --> 00:10:59,410
Scott: maybe there'll be some sort of Intel AMD thing.

188
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:08,409
Scott: I mean AMD is currently winning now in terms of gamers and which which is faster I mean in the latest steam survey, there's more AMD's than Intel's going on.

189
00:11:09,413 --> 00:11:13,129
Scott: So maybe you know Dell doesn't really make so many AMD's as far as I know.

190
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:23,209
Scott: So if they get the Alienware, maybe they'll be less AMD's and more Intel's Yeah, or maybe this will change something in some sort of Nvidia ATI way.

191
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:24,849
Scott: Who knows?

192
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,212
Rym: All right.

193
00:11:26,696 --> 00:11:28,549
Rym: I don't think this is gonna have any effect anywhere.

194
00:11:29,551 --> 00:11:31,194
Rym: If it even happens, we'll see.

195
00:11:38,245 --> 00:11:38,626
Rym: All right.

196
00:11:38,726 --> 00:11:44,902
Rym: So my thing of the day I found this Transcript someone made of World of Warcraft.

197
00:11:45,123 --> 00:11:46,710
Rym: had it been a text adventure.

198
00:11:47,531 --> 00:11:55,490
Rym: Wait, so is it actually a text adventure you play or no, no, no No, it's just a transcript of what World of Warcraft would be like if it was a text adventure.

199
00:11:56,012 --> 00:12:00,610
Scott: Okay, so it's like N and then there's a carriage return and then it says there's a monster something like that.

200
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:11,639
Rym: All right, and basically in my opinion this distills Everything that I hate about World of Warcraft because it takes you know This abstract game and it compresses it down into.

201
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,405
Rym: here's what you're actually doing.

202
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:14,107
Rym: They're pretty.

203
00:12:14,148 --> 00:12:14,890
Rym: graphics aside.

204
00:12:15,011 --> 00:12:17,150
Rym: Here's what you were doing with your life hour after hour.

205
00:12:18,351 --> 00:12:27,770
Scott: Maybe people who played see the problem is there are a million things like this that just plainly show What's wrong with these sorts of games and people who play it read it and laugh and go?

206
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,527
Scott: Yeah, that's what it is and they keep playing.

207
00:12:30,492 --> 00:12:32,379
Scott: If someone shows me something I'm doing is dumb.

208
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,105
Scott: I stopped doing it.

209
00:12:34,748 --> 00:12:35,290
Rym: Oh, really?

210
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:42,305
Rym: Yeah I'm not gonna get into it here, but you don't make eggs.

211
00:12:42,365 --> 00:12:46,219
Scott: very well when you cook I make I like I weigh like.

212
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:48,767
Scott: I like the way you make McDonald's eggs.

213
00:12:48,787 --> 00:12:49,650
Scott: It's not a McDonald's.

214
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:55,526
Rym: Have a solid massive egg that you make hot and there's just this dense mass of a.

215
00:12:55,947 --> 00:12:56,549
Scott: that's what egg is.

216
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,573
Rym: It's not a.

217
00:12:57,674 --> 00:13:00,608
Scott: you make it hot until it's not goopy anymore and you eat it.

218
00:13:02,492 --> 00:13:02,895
Scott: That's how you.

219
00:13:02,956 --> 00:13:03,763
Scott: it's what you do with an egg.

220
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:09,527
Rym: All right Yeah, that's right, so uh, what's your thing of the day mr.

221
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:10,190
Rym: McDonald's egg?

222
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:14,190
Scott: Well Mortal Kombat 3 is sort of the not so good fighting game.

223
00:13:14,371 --> 00:13:17,001
Rym: I'd submit that it's one of the worst fighting games ever made.

224
00:13:17,202 --> 00:13:19,010
Scott: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

225
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:25,454
Scott: I said one of no in the pit of worst is definitely in the mediocre Fighting game area.

226
00:13:25,634 --> 00:13:29,825
Scott: the worst fighting game area is reserved for many games.

227
00:13:29,905 --> 00:13:31,710
Scott: I can't even mention cuz battle raper.

228
00:13:33,334 --> 00:13:35,869
Scott: Um, no, they're even worse ones than that.

229
00:13:36,852 --> 00:13:39,180
Scott: Let me think can you name Shaq foo?

230
00:13:39,521 --> 00:13:42,090
Rym: Shaq foo was kind of awesome until I wasn't a fighting game.

231
00:13:43,051 --> 00:13:47,429
Rym: It was a what it was a platformer slash walk down the street hitting things game weapon lords.

232
00:13:48,612 --> 00:13:49,819
Rym: That game wasn't so bad.

233
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,906
Scott: Oh, that was the worst.

234
00:13:50,926 --> 00:13:51,489
Scott: that all right.

235
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,995
Scott: We'll play it later and we'll see.

236
00:13:53,156 --> 00:13:55,284
Rym: I'd rather play that than Mortal Kombat 3.

237
00:13:55,284 --> 00:13:56,589
Scott: I don't know about that.

238
00:13:57,031 --> 00:14:00,729
Scott: Anyway, it was much worse than Mortal Kombat 2 and 1 for sure.

239
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:06,950
Scott: So Of course like every other Mortal Kombat game they had fatalities which are introduced in Mortal Kombat 1.

240
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,757
Scott: We're basically this little gimmick of thing.

241
00:14:08,777 --> 00:14:12,090
Scott: You know, you memorize some button pattern and you could see a cool animation.

242
00:14:12,592 --> 00:14:13,938
Rym: Yeah, it was a horrible thing.

243
00:14:14,099 --> 00:14:15,103
Rym: Basically the way it worked.

244
00:14:15,124 --> 00:14:16,550
Rym: for any of you never played Mortal Kombat.

245
00:14:16,711 --> 00:14:17,919
Rym: I mean modern fighting games.

246
00:14:18,241 --> 00:14:21,145
Rym: the combos make sense like in Soul Calibur.

247
00:14:21,165 --> 00:14:25,905
Rym: a Combo is basically just doing moves in a certain order usually or getting into a stancer make.

248
00:14:25,945 --> 00:14:27,129
Rym: there's some sort of flow to it.

249
00:14:27,612 --> 00:14:32,750
Rym: in Mortal Kombat Moves were things like up up down left down up down a be down up down left.

250
00:14:33,437 --> 00:14:34,489
Scott: No, they're simpler than that.

251
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,555
Scott: But there's something.

252
00:14:35,615 --> 00:14:36,480
Rym: everyone had a complex.

253
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,510
Scott: some of the special moves are pretty complicated.

254
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:43,565
Scott: But all the combos in Mortal Kombat 10, especially starting in Mortal Kombat 2 tended to be juggle combos.

255
00:14:43,805 --> 00:14:49,707
Rym: now until you get to fatalities Yeah, when you beat someone like beat him beat him like you've already won the fight.

256
00:14:49,747 --> 00:14:51,493
Scott: It doesn't matter now You've won the end.

257
00:14:51,895 --> 00:14:59,610
Rym: then they'll stand there all woozy and you have about three seconds to do a crazy Combo like something that's almost impossible to do with human fingers.

258
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,420
Scott: Well, some of them are simple like I remember.

259
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,170
Scott: some of them were like down down down high kick.

260
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:13,509
Rym: Yeah some of them were like up down left right circle two buttons at once and you had to be a certain distance away from the Guy and yet he's facing in the right direction and if you screw up at all, it didn't work.

261
00:15:13,852 --> 00:15:17,761
Rym: Yep, a lot of times instead of doing it You just punch the guy once and then he'd fall over and it'd be over.

262
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:25,295
Scott: or a lot of times you just uppercut the guy Or your guy would like duck and stand up and then jump and then it would be over And the other guy see.

263
00:15:25,315 --> 00:15:28,729
Scott: if you didn't do it quick enough the other guy would just fall over and the fight was over.

264
00:15:29,174 --> 00:15:33,056
Rym: but it was only really two Bands of appeal in these one.

265
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:37,670
Rym: middle school kids want to see violence and they were incredibly horridly violent.

266
00:15:38,052 --> 00:15:45,909
Rym: Oh, yeah, that's what it was about - if you're in an arcade It was just like the final stake of humiliation into the guy's throat after you beat him.

267
00:15:46,131 --> 00:15:49,353
Scott: Mortal Kombat 2 was really towards the end of the arcade days Like I remember.

268
00:15:49,394 --> 00:16:02,372
Scott: we have an arcade in our mall where I live and it's still there But it doesn't get so much action now, you know back in the Mortal Kombat 2 days and that machine was there There were people about like crazy playing Mortal Kombat 2.

269
00:16:02,372 --> 00:16:03,519
Rym: There's an arcade called tilt.

270
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:07,138
Rym: actually in the mall where I grew up There used to be water slides in the mall.

271
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,650
Rym: Whoa, and then they got rid of those water slides.

272
00:16:09,831 --> 00:16:13,986
Rym: I never got to use him because I know when I was really young I'd always see him and I never knew what they were.

273
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:22,270
Rym: and Because they were like in this special glassed-off area and before I was old enough to do it They shut it down and they put an arcade in there instead.

274
00:16:22,591 --> 00:16:23,254
Scott: No, that's not so bad.

275
00:16:23,636 --> 00:16:28,439
Rym: And so I used to hang out of that arcade, you know back when arcades were awesome They're still awesome.

276
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:38,266
Scott: Just people don't go to them Yeah, and most arcades end up not being awesome because they either go out of because no one goes to them Yeah, because they don't have good games, but they don't have good games cuz no one goes.

277
00:16:38,307 --> 00:16:38,949
Rym: Oh my god.

278
00:16:39,311 --> 00:16:40,194
Rym: Yeah, there's really.

279
00:16:40,275 --> 00:16:42,705
Rym: it's almost impossible to have a good arcade unless you're in Wildwood.

280
00:16:42,725 --> 00:16:43,347
Rym: go to Japan.

281
00:16:43,468 --> 00:16:43,990
Scott: go to Japan.

282
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,054
Rym: Yeah, yeah in the u.s.

283
00:16:45,174 --> 00:16:50,807
Scott: Mortal Kombat all I got to say about Japan's arcades Mario Kart arcade Yeah, that's all I got to say.

284
00:16:51,692 --> 00:16:57,550
Rym: So I remember when Mortal Kombat 2 like the machine came out and they got two of them in that arcade.

285
00:16:58,253 --> 00:17:06,929
Rym: There was a crowd of people so thick you could not even see the machine Does from the moment that mall opened until the moment it closed every day?

286
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:14,761
Scott: Yeah I remember when a few months after that every movie theater had a machine and there were at least two guys playing it all the Time and everywhere it was.

287
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:15,568
Scott: it was the greatest.

288
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:21,369
Scott: Well, not the greatest but anyway Mortal Kombat 3 was not quite so popular because it was after these days.

289
00:17:21,711 --> 00:17:28,410
Rym: Yeah, Mortal Kombat 1 2 & 3 are basically the same game just with more characters and moves and different characters and moves.

290
00:17:28,577 --> 00:17:33,830
Rym: Yeah But uh other games progressed in technology and Mortal Kombat did not.

291
00:17:34,071 --> 00:17:35,274
Scott: Mortal Kombat just add.

292
00:17:35,314 --> 00:17:37,079
Scott: like a Mortal Kombat 1 you had fatalities.

293
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:50,053
Scott: Mortal Kombat 2 was like the perfection of Mortal Kombat 1. in 3 they added like Babalities and animalities and friendships and all these gimmick crap crazy Nonsense.

294
00:17:50,113 --> 00:17:59,842
Scott: and you'll see in my thing of the day which we finally are getting to now is a video of every single fatality Babality animality and friendship in Mortal Kombat 3.

295
00:17:59,842 --> 00:18:06,145
Rym: so if you think Jack Thompson, you know I mean he hates grand grand theft auto because of all the violence and gore and whatever.

296
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:14,507
Rym: I Don't think the people who crusade against video games these days Remember the shitstorm that arose around Mortal Kombat when we were young.

297
00:18:14,668 --> 00:18:16,796
Scott: no, man That was the first thing they went after.

298
00:18:16,816 --> 00:18:20,570
Scott: it's just they gave up on it when other games, you know became easier target.

299
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:25,970
Rym: I watched this again, and I forgot that Mortal Kombat is still one of the most violent games I've ever played.

300
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:27,562
Scott: Yeah, it's just.

301
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:32,020
Scott: you know At least in Gran Turismo the gore makes sense.

302
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,450
Scott: It's like somewhat realistic like you shoot a guy he dies.

303
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:38,790
Rym: This is like you punch a guy you knock his head off and you grab his spinal cord and rip it out and whip it.

304
00:18:39,931 --> 00:18:45,430
Scott: Or you know you chop a guy up into ten pieces then blood blows everywhere and then his skeleton comes out.

305
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,090
Scott: There's a million Gibbs falling from the sky.

306
00:18:48,411 --> 00:18:56,079
Rym: Unless you had the SNES version of Mortal Kombat 1 then it was sweat and green slime because they weren't allowed to show blood Yep, but the Genesis.

307
00:18:56,601 --> 00:18:57,967
Scott: Oh, yeah, it was working just fine.

308
00:18:58,047 --> 00:18:58,690
Rym: blood code.

309
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,646
Scott: Of course, if you had either one of those systems, you're probably better off playing Street Fighter.

310
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:09,469
Scott:  yeah Either turbo for the SNES or championship edition for the Genesis Which were pretty much equal games.

311
00:19:10,351 --> 00:19:16,350
Rym: Alright, so it's favorites week and it's Tuesday, which means we could talk about either video games or board games.

312
00:19:16,992 --> 00:19:23,909
Scott: We're you do video games this time and board games will be saved for favorites week - yep Which will come whenever we run out of things to talk about another week.

313
00:19:24,353 --> 00:19:32,399
Scott: Yep, and now for our disclaimer Which we're going to say at the beginning of every favorites week episode because you know Some people only listen to some days of the podcast.

314
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,270
Rym: Yes, and if you don't know we have more than one day every week.

315
00:19:35,531 --> 00:19:36,936
Scott: Yep, is it?

316
00:19:36,996 --> 00:19:39,163
Scott: favorites is not the same thing as best.

317
00:19:39,826 --> 00:19:48,170
Scott: the best thing ever is Something that everyone can agree on or that you know experts can say oh that is definitely the best video game ever made.

318
00:19:48,571 --> 00:19:52,201
Scott: But it's also very okay to say something's the best and also hate it.

319
00:19:52,883 --> 00:19:55,350
Rym: Yeah, it's also very up to interpretation and argument.

320
00:19:55,471 --> 00:19:57,680
Rym: I mean Babe Ruth is the best baseball player ever.

321
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,447
Rym: No Hank Aaron's the best baseball player ever.

322
00:19:59,467 --> 00:20:00,010
Rym: You can go to hell.

323
00:20:00,191 --> 00:20:07,110
Scott: Yeah, I could argue that Babe Ruth is the best baseball player ever But at the same time not like Babe Ruth or be a fan of him at all.

324
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:11,425
Rym: Yep, so we're very much talking about our favorite things ever which means one.

325
00:20:11,445 --> 00:20:14,949
Rym: you can debate us But you can't argue with us because it's our opinion.

326
00:20:15,711 --> 00:20:16,574
Scott: Yeah, you could be like.

327
00:20:17,036 --> 00:20:20,930
Scott: the thing you think is the favorite sucks and I'll say okay that means it's not the best.

328
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,925
Scott: It doesn't mean it's not my favorite because when I say it's my favorite it is, you know, I'm lying.

329
00:20:24,945 --> 00:20:27,258
Rym: I Don't think we're gonna lie about this.

330
00:20:27,278 --> 00:20:28,103
Scott: No, I don't think.

331
00:20:28,244 --> 00:20:28,788
Scott: why would I lie?

332
00:20:29,714 --> 00:20:37,139
Scott: Big especially when I'm talking, you know If anyone who knows me will know I'm not lying when I say that the best video game Well, not the best video game.

333
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:40,013
Scott: The best video game is probably Zelda 1 or something I don't even know.

334
00:20:40,655 --> 00:20:43,343
Scott: my favorite video game ever is Mega Man 2.

335
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:46,554
Rym: this kid freaking loves Mega Man 2 in a way That is unhealthy.

336
00:20:46,594 --> 00:20:49,566
Scott: I played Mega Man 2 for the NES like a thousand times.

337
00:20:49,587 --> 00:20:54,525
Rym: I don't even know He is as much a machine at that game as I am at bionic commando.

338
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:55,790
Scott: No bionic commando.

339
00:20:56,632 --> 00:21:03,513
Scott: I got Mega Man - I got my NES the day before my birthday like April 29th some year I don't even know.

340
00:21:04,135 --> 00:21:07,388
Scott: and I got Mario Duck Hunt when I got it the next morning.

341
00:21:07,408 --> 00:21:09,404
Scott: They were like, okay Here's your birthday present is Mega Man.

342
00:21:09,424 --> 00:21:09,444
Scott: .

343
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:15,773
Scott: Mega Man - oh my god, I Nowadays Mega Man like.

344
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,747
Scott: I'm playing the Mega Man X collection right now, which I'll talk about soon enough.

345
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,799
Rym: Yeah, I have my opinions on most Mega Man games.

346
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,064
Scott: Yeah, but new.

347
00:21:23,105 --> 00:21:24,651
Scott: now it's all about figuring out It's.

348
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:31,430
Scott: it's all about knowing what order to beat the guys in knowing where the secret power-ups are the horrible and arbitrary secrets.

349
00:21:31,913 --> 00:21:33,221
Scott: Oh, they're not arbitrary secrets.

350
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:34,107
Scott: You just don't understand.

351
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:38,599
Scott: but Arbitrary secrets are like Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.

352
00:21:38,619 --> 00:21:39,682
Scott: That's an arbitrary secret.

353
00:21:40,004 --> 00:21:40,746
Scott: or ogre battle 64.

354
00:21:40,746 --> 00:21:41,228
Scott: That's an hour.

355
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:43,703
Rym: Don't get me started on that game.

356
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:49,210
Scott: All right, but Mega Man - I played that without anyone's help just all on my own.

357
00:21:49,692 --> 00:21:51,739
Scott: I beat it from start every single guy.

358
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:57,619
Scott: like when I first started playing I had no skills whatsoever And I was just trying to beat all eight robot masters.

359
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:01,130
Scott: Imagine trying to beat eight robot masters not knowing anything.

360
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,236
Scott: It's like you try all the different levels.

361
00:22:03,477 --> 00:22:08,614
Scott: you die in quick commands level because the lasers so you just give up on him and wait Until you have more powers.

362
00:22:08,895 --> 00:22:12,410
Rym: Yep, even though honestly, I always tried to beat him first when I first got that game

363
00:22:12,672 --> 00:22:23,670
Scott: Yeah, and then like with flash man I would just flash man was the first guy I could beat so it always beat flash man And then tried to beat everyone else or I'd write down my flash man password and then tried to beat everyone else.

364
00:22:23,771 --> 00:22:29,530
Scott: But then I realized I wanted to be crash man before flash man So I could break all the blocks in his level to get the E and stuff.

365
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:37,150
Scott: Yep, and what I you know, I don't think you needed to break the blocks to get the E. I think you just get the E without them, but you still wanted to break the blocks to make the level go easier.

366
00:22:38,251 --> 00:22:40,664
Scott: But yeah, wow, that game is so terrific.

367
00:22:41,066 --> 00:22:47,870
Scott: I mean Megaman one, you know Megaman 2 doesn't really have much on Megaman 1 in terms of gameplay.

368
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:54,873
Scott: It's just the level design and the bad guys and everything was just more polished You know.

369
00:22:54,893 --> 00:23:05,568
Scott: and Megaman 1 was also stupid hard and really rough around the edges you know and especially like in the later levels like guys would fly around and patterns that kind of didn't make sense.

370
00:23:05,828 --> 00:23:10,298
Rym: and You know, I never beat Megaman 1 ever.

371
00:23:10,379 --> 00:23:16,656
Scott: I beat Megaman 1 but Megaman 1 is just kind of like really bland In fact, I never beat guts man ever.

372
00:23:16,998 --> 00:23:18,602
Scott: Wow, I can be okay.

373
00:23:19,004 --> 00:23:21,291
Scott: I've gotten to the wily parts of Megaman 1.

374
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:22,796
Scott: Yeah, definitely because that's for you.

375
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:25,446
Scott: fight the yellow guy who you got the one eyeball.

376
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:27,814
Rym: Ah Yeah, I've seen I know him.

377
00:23:27,834 --> 00:23:28,557
Rym: I know what he looks like.

378
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:31,006
Scott: Anyway, yeah, that's that's Megaman 1.

379
00:23:31,006 --> 00:23:34,894
Rym: see the first Megaman game I played was Megaman 3 Megaman 3.

380
00:23:34,894 --> 00:23:45,870
Scott: a lot of people say the Megaman 3 is better than Megaman 2. and you know, that's where the slide first appeared and parts of That's our protoman appeared.

381
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:53,710
Scott: You know, I can't deny some of these things like protoman and the slide or the famous hold left on controller - yeah.

382
00:23:54,514 --> 00:23:57,869
Scott: But parts of Megaman 3 also, you know just not.

383
00:23:58,834 --> 00:23:59,597
Scott: It was just different.

384
00:23:59,637 --> 00:24:00,682
Scott: It's a whole different feeling.

385
00:24:00,722 --> 00:24:02,270
Scott: I mean you had like Gemini man.

386
00:24:02,812 --> 00:24:06,564
Scott: It's really the bad guys the eight robot master.

387
00:24:06,584 --> 00:24:10,010
Scott: That's why when you go buy a Megaman shirt This is I defeated the eight robot masters.

388
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,436
Scott: Whatever eight robot masters.

389
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:14,490
Scott: you see on that shirt the Megaman 2 robot masters.

390
00:24:14,914 --> 00:24:16,329
Scott: There's a reason for that.

391
00:24:16,731 --> 00:24:26,002
Scott: It was all about the robot masters and their levels that were so perfect and the music that was so perfect That music would be like it's still better any video game music.

392
00:24:26,022 --> 00:24:27,607
Scott: You'll ever find the Megaman 2 music.

393
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:28,349
Scott: Oh my god.

394
00:24:28,871 --> 00:24:30,396
Scott: Especially the first wily level.

395
00:24:30,777 --> 00:24:32,664
Scott: they had the best music like ever.

396
00:24:33,025 --> 00:24:34,550
Scott: They're like a thousand remixes of it.

397
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:35,074
Scott: It's so good.

398
00:24:35,577 --> 00:24:39,890
Rym: now see if we're talking that era of games You know the prime of the original NES.

399
00:24:41,151 --> 00:24:46,225
Rym: It's really a toss-up for me between Zelda 2 and bionic commando But I'm gonna have to go with bionic commando.

400
00:24:46,265 --> 00:24:46,990
Rym: that game is just fantastic.

401
00:24:48,012 --> 00:24:50,289
Scott: Yeah, people yell at you if you say Zelda 2 is good.

402
00:24:50,611 --> 00:24:53,305
Rym: Hey, I think Zelda 2 is better than Zelda 1 and you can all go to hell.

403
00:24:53,426 --> 00:25:07,962
Rym: Yeah, you got a problem But anyway bionic commando for any of you haven't played it You know, there's platformers and platformer was basically the primary genre of the original NES Because Super Mario Brothers and then everyone tried to make a game that was kind of like that.

404
00:25:08,584 --> 00:25:12,749
Rym: now bionic commando was a platformer Except you couldn't jump.

405
00:25:13,695 --> 00:25:14,983
Rym: There was no jumping in this game.

406
00:25:15,224 --> 00:25:15,667
Scott: No jumping.

407
00:25:15,888 --> 00:25:21,364
Rym: instead You had a grappling hook and this was an entirely new mode of play that created.

408
00:25:21,545 --> 00:25:21,926
Rym: Awesome.

409
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:22,828
Rym: Awesome.

410
00:25:23,009 --> 00:25:26,349
Rym: Awesome Awesome, I cannot express to you how much I love that game.

411
00:25:26,532 --> 00:25:38,168
Scott: Yeah The variety of moves and different like platform situations that can occur in bionic commando is really crazy and like you always have to figure out exactly the right way to use it to avoid getting hit and make it over the whole.

412
00:25:38,188 --> 00:25:43,310
Rym: and Like if you've seen someone playing the game versus watching say me play the game or someone else who's good.

413
00:25:43,852 --> 00:25:45,340
Rym: Normally the game you like you're very careful.

414
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,204
Rym: You're trying not to get hit.

415
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:47,028
Rym: you die all the time.

416
00:25:47,551 --> 00:25:50,950
Rym: Watching someone who's good at that game play that game is like watching a ballerina.

417
00:25:51,731 --> 00:25:53,930
Rym: Did you're flipping yourself through the air catching things?

418
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:58,229
Rym: You didn't even know you could catch flying around all over the place dodging bullets by the skin of your teeth.

419
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:12,981
Scott: Yeah, Mega Man 2 is really a game where you know, if you suck which I did back in those ancient times You know, you gradually improve your skills and it hones you into being the you know A master until what you cannot play Mega Man 2 better in any way.

420
00:26:13,182 --> 00:26:15,430
Rym: the learning curve on bionic commando is a brick wall.

421
00:26:15,571 --> 00:26:17,701
Scott: Yeah, bionic commando is like this brick wall.

422
00:26:17,741 --> 00:26:23,543
Scott: But once you mount the brick wall It's like this amazing amazingness of crazy like it took.

423
00:26:23,644 --> 00:26:25,510
Scott: limit is so high to what you can do.

424
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:34,973
Rym: It took me I think three or four months from when I first got the game Until I could get past the first half of the game because the game culminates in level 6.

425
00:26:34,973 --> 00:26:36,240
Rym: Level 6 is like the.

426
00:26:36,743 --> 00:26:37,930
Rym: this is the trial by fire.

427
00:26:38,111 --> 00:26:40,741
Rym: If you can beat this will let you play the rest of the game.

428
00:26:40,762 --> 00:26:50,368
Rym: and let me tell you the first day I beat level 6 I ran around my house screaming I couldn't believe it and then I learned that the rest of the game was twice as hard as level 6.

429
00:26:50,368 --> 00:26:55,050
Rym: Wow Of course bionic commando is also the game where at the end you kill a naked Hitler.

430
00:26:56,051 --> 00:27:00,448
Rym: yep, Hitler appears and he's naked and he says the word damn which oh.

431
00:27:02,055 --> 00:27:02,725
Rym: And then you kill him.

432
00:27:03,411 --> 00:27:12,729
Scott: Yeah, Mega Man 2 I beat it like downstairs in my living room my brother watching and we were like, oh I think it took me two tries once I finally got to the alien guy at the end.

433
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:12,950
Scott: man.

434
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:15,090
Rym: Remember those days when when you got close to beating a game?

435
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:20,456
Rym: You'd call your friend or your brother and they come and watch to kind of verify your victory The first time I beat Zelda 1.

436
00:27:20,456 --> 00:27:26,516
Scott: I did it using I think only the silver arrow in front of like a bunch of friends My brother in my room.

437
00:27:26,997 --> 00:27:27,940
Scott: That was a crazy day.

438
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,590
Scott: I remember it actually very clearly like it's crazy.

439
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:35,892
Rym: Yeah, I remember the first time I beat Final Fantasy 1.

440
00:27:35,892 --> 00:27:44,145
Rym: I screamed and my brother runs into the room and all the Texas flying by and We sat there just staring at the screen like wow, it's over.

441
00:27:44,165 --> 00:27:46,835
Scott: Mm-hmm Yeah, Zelda 1.

442
00:27:46,835 --> 00:27:47,878
Scott: I would like.

443
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:51,450
Scott: if you would have asked me ten years ago Zelda 1 would have been my favorite game.

444
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:52,193
Scott: The problem was all.

445
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:59,659
Scott: the one is that when you're a little kid and you have that like, you know Wonder and whatnot and you'll burn every bush.

446
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:03,950
Scott: You've never played Zelda 1 before you know, and you don't know everything already.

447
00:28:04,411 --> 00:28:13,985
Scott: it's so fantastic the exploring and the figuring things out and the going from level to level and Levels in any order and collecting different items and using one different things.

448
00:28:14,005 --> 00:28:15,390
Rym: I don't have time for that shit anymore.

449
00:28:15,913 --> 00:28:17,038
Scott: Yeah, it was so great.

450
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,370
Scott: But nowadays it's it's not so great anymore.

451
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:23,465
Scott: I just I can beat Zelda 1 in like 40 minutes, you know, so it's kind of like.

452
00:28:23,807 --> 00:28:29,651
Rym: and now it's just yeah And there are games that are as good and are very similar, but I just don't have the time to sit there and burn every Bush.

453
00:28:29,912 --> 00:28:41,643
Scott: Yeah, I mean the first time I beat Zelda 1 like when I finally got to level 9 I was like scared shitless with that music and I didn't know where to go and it was like, oh Yeah, but nowadays it's like doo doo doo doo.

454
00:28:41,924 --> 00:28:44,559
Scott: Let's go begin and there he is He's dead.

455
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,250
Scott: I got the princess.

456
00:28:46,311 --> 00:28:46,653
Rym: It's weird.

457
00:28:46,674 --> 00:28:47,579
Rym: I remember as a little kid.

458
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,377
Rym: I would actually get scared Endangerous parts.

459
00:28:50,457 --> 00:28:52,350
Scott: Oh, I was super scared in Zelda 1.

460
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,675
Rym: Holy shit Simon's quest.

461
00:28:53,776 --> 00:29:00,189
Rym: when I got to that because at the end of Simon's quest which Simon's quest is right up there in my Opinion that's my favorite Castlevania game ever.

462
00:29:01,131 --> 00:29:04,767
Scott: Yeah, I like Castlevania 1 the most but I'm not really the hugest Castlevania fan.

463
00:29:04,807 --> 00:29:06,896
Rym: So yeah I just really like Simon's quest.

464
00:29:06,916 --> 00:29:25,610
Rym: that game scared the hell out of me when I was a kid mainly because the game is poorly Translated right and you'll find these cryptic things around like you'll find a bunch of people just hung to death in the background And then you'll find like a cryptic poorly translated text that as a little kid It just kind of scares you know at the end of the game you walk into Dracula's castle, right?

465
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,018
Rym: But Dracula's already dead.

466
00:29:27,461 --> 00:29:28,810
Rym: So the music changes.

467
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:32,272
Rym: It's the scary music and it's this long long Castle.

468
00:29:32,292 --> 00:29:35,770
Rym: you have to walk all the way through it and up and down ladders and stairs and whatever.

469
00:29:36,592 --> 00:29:37,400
Rym: There's no monsters.

470
00:29:37,864 --> 00:29:38,510
Rym: There's no nothing.

471
00:29:38,891 --> 00:29:44,769
Rym: There's nothing in the castle, but you have to walk through it and I was scared shitless that something was gonna jump out at me.

472
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:48,740
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna talk about the scariest games legacy.

473
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,709
Scott: the wizard might be the scariest but that was just me.

474
00:29:52,311 --> 00:29:57,848
Scott: It was just so strange and sort of eerie and the way the game was and the music combined.

475
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,049
Scott: It was.

476
00:29:59,452 --> 00:30:09,470
Scott: It's like you're a little tiny guy and the game is all sort of cute and happy But you're going down and down and down to this dark scary crazy dungeon and it gets scarier and darker the more down you go.

477
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:12,988
Scott: It's like you're going all over these weird places and only certain people go.

478
00:30:13,129 --> 00:30:15,216
Scott: Oh god Play the game sometime.

479
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:18,710
Rym: Yeah, I don't like it that much just because I don't have patience for games like that.

480
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,595
Rym: But it's a game.

481
00:30:19,977 --> 00:30:20,661
Rym: I just respect it.

482
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:27,167
Scott: I just wish that like some of these games are experienced different based on your state of mind and level of skill.

483
00:30:27,288 --> 00:30:32,909
Scott: and like Nowadays, you know with the person I am the game isn't as good as if I was the person I was.

484
00:30:33,912 --> 00:30:35,685
Rym: You know, yeah, well our brains are different.

485
00:30:35,705 --> 00:30:36,450
Rym: We've experienced more.

486
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:41,808
Rym: I mean if Empire hunter D was a goddamn masterpiece when I was in fourth grade.

487
00:30:42,229 --> 00:30:45,170
Rym: now It's just a mediocre guy killing things bloodily.

488
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:50,050
Scott: It's like when you're a 20th level fighter a kobold is nothing but when you're a first level fighter a kobold is great.

489
00:30:50,251 --> 00:30:52,481
Scott: I just sometimes I'm like a 20th level fire.

490
00:30:52,521 --> 00:30:54,370
Scott: We are wishing I was a first level fighter.

491
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:59,288
Rym: So if you experience the joy of killing kobolds, we're Lena inverse and we already killed chevron igdo.

492
00:30:59,508 --> 00:31:02,459
Scott: Yeah Yeah, we're watching slayers.

493
00:31:02,881 --> 00:31:03,163
Scott: Yeah.

494
00:31:03,485 --> 00:31:05,252
Scott: Okay, so Let's see.

495
00:31:05,292 --> 00:31:08,124
Rym: All right Friday the 13th used to scare the hell out of me when I was a kid.

496
00:31:08,144 --> 00:31:11,679
Rym: Yeah the game No, not the movies.

497
00:31:11,699 --> 00:31:13,105
Scott: the game no, none of the nut.

498
00:31:13,125 --> 00:31:14,210
Scott: that really didn't get me anything.

499
00:31:15,831 --> 00:31:18,157
Scott: Alright, let's talk about some PC games.

500
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:25,976
Rym: Alright, I'd have to say my favorite PC game ever ever ever ever would have to be Quake 2 not tie fighter.

501
00:31:25,996 --> 00:31:27,140
Rym: I don't see type.

502
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,229
Rym: Alright best single-player game ever hands-down tie fighter.

503
00:31:30,811 --> 00:31:34,406
Rym: Best multiplayer game ever hands-down Quake 2 and all the associated mods.

504
00:31:34,707 --> 00:31:34,928
Rym: Mm-hmm.

505
00:31:35,731 --> 00:31:40,430
Rym: So, uh, let's start with single-player first since we've been talking mostly about single-player old-school type games.

506
00:31:40,852 --> 00:31:41,997
Scott: Oh single-player is tough.

507
00:31:42,258 --> 00:31:55,559
Scott: It might be met warrior - It might be One or half-life - Oh half-life one might be civilization - ooh It's a tough call especially if you're gonna keep it to only PC.

508
00:31:55,579 --> 00:31:57,385
Rym: I have to go with tie fighter.

509
00:31:57,505 --> 00:32:00,550
Rym: that game Destroyed my life.

510
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,197
Scott: Yeah, I didn't play tie fighter that much.

511
00:32:02,258 --> 00:32:13,723
Rym: That's why you know, I played it all the way through Beat it and then went all the way through again like destroying everything like I flew around destroying Entire like fleets with my one tie fighter.

512
00:32:13,924 --> 00:32:15,189
Rym: I got that good in that board.

513
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:21,530
Scott: Huh if I had to think of which ones like, you know had the most effect on me, especially back in the day.

514
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:21,811
Scott: It's go.

515
00:32:21,831 --> 00:32:24,159
Scott: you met courier - I mean damn.

516
00:32:24,199 --> 00:32:33,350
Scott: you had these missions and there was a story that you keep track of and you Customize the max and the missions are complex and it was a complex simulation of a giant robot and you're shooting guys.

517
00:32:34,115 --> 00:32:36,309
Scott: It's better than any other mech game that's ever been around.

518
00:32:37,013 --> 00:32:40,809
Rym: Well tie fighter is probably the best free space fighting game ever.

519
00:32:41,553 --> 00:32:44,510
Scott: Yeah, I mean basically descent - is also really good.

520
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:48,590
Rym: But it is really good, but it didn't have the Star Wars theme and high fighter was just so clean.

521
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:53,470
Rym: I mean that the basic history here is that x-wing came out and it was an amazing game.

522
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:55,417
Rym: It was fairly revolutionary is very well done.

523
00:32:55,437 --> 00:32:59,070
Rym: It was hard as hell and it had a lot of rough edges.

524
00:33:00,152 --> 00:33:04,116
Rym: So fast forward a few years and they made tie fighter Which is basically the same game.

525
00:33:04,196 --> 00:33:16,926
Rym: only now you're on the bad guys side and they polished it a bit and by a bit I mean There was a time when PC gamer the ratings that they gave to games mattered Like they were fairly objective and if they said a game was good.

526
00:33:16,946 --> 00:33:25,323
Rym: It was good they gave tie fighter the highest rating they had ever given a game and Then a few years later a game beat tie fighter.

527
00:33:25,644 --> 00:33:26,930
Rym: You know what game beat tie fighter?

528
00:33:27,871 --> 00:33:29,819
Rym: Tie fighter on a CD.

529
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,527
Rym: It was the same game just re-released.

530
00:33:31,687 --> 00:33:40,830
Rym: And yeah, I Remember that tie fighter which is so well done because on one hand you're a tie fighter pilot and you gotta you know Fight the rebels and the fighting was really good.

531
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:46,430
Rym: The missions were really good at primary and secondary objectives and you only had to do the primary objectives to continue.

532
00:33:46,792 --> 00:33:50,649
Rym: The secondary ones were just for fun or to prove how badass you were to unlock the story.

533
00:33:51,731 --> 00:33:58,554
Rym: there were also these secret missions where you could basically become a spy for the Emperor and Do crazy stuff in the game.

534
00:33:58,775 --> 00:34:03,226
Rym: Oh, you'd get tattoos if you were good and the Emperor would give you powers.

535
00:34:03,246 --> 00:34:05,498
Rym: I Love that game.

536
00:34:06,247 --> 00:34:18,094
Scott: Yeah if I had to pick a single-player FPS to say that was like Ever, you know, it's really tough because half-life 1 was like such a great Freaking game.

537
00:34:18,315 --> 00:34:20,183
Scott: Yeah, but half-life 2 single-player.

538
00:34:20,223 --> 00:34:22,110
Scott: I had I can't deny that it was better.

539
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:22,952
Scott: I mean, it's just.

540
00:34:23,474 --> 00:34:28,467
Scott: uh, I hate naming recent games because I like to be old-school but half-life 2 has to be it.

541
00:34:29,272 --> 00:34:30,277
Rym: Yeah, I haven't played it yet.

542
00:34:30,297 --> 00:34:32,592
Rym: So I can't say oh my god I can't.

543
00:34:32,773 --> 00:34:36,848
Rym: I can't pretend that quake 2 is a good FPS single-player wise because it's half-life 2 had.

544
00:34:36,888 --> 00:34:42,395
Scott: all the Feelings of half-life 1 are like, you know, you're in danger You're short on resources.

545
00:34:42,435 --> 00:34:43,178
Scott: You're running around.

546
00:34:43,217 --> 00:34:46,549
Scott: the story is is you know combined with the action?

547
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:51,663
Scott: solidly and You know you feel you you're you in.

548
00:34:51,683 --> 00:34:53,130
Scott: most FPS is like in Wolfenstein.

549
00:34:53,251 --> 00:34:55,590
Scott: I don't feel like I'm the Nazi prisoner trying to escape.

550
00:34:55,851 --> 00:34:58,770
Scott: I feel like just a crazy guy trying to kill all Nazis in doom.

551
00:34:58,851 --> 00:35:00,769
Scott: I don't feel like I'm the doom guy stuck on Mars.

552
00:35:00,971 --> 00:35:02,978
Scott: I feel like I'm just gonna kill all his demons.

553
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,210
Scott: when half-life you feel like you're Gordon Freeman, you know.

554
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:10,750
Rym: Yeah, I mean I poo-pooed it because I didn't play the game until much later like well after it had come out.

555
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:14,044
Rym: In fact, I only bought it because I wanted to play counter-strike.

556
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:15,370
Scott: You'll talk about kind of strike in a minute.

557
00:35:15,651 --> 00:35:30,429
Rym: Yeah, but as I played through half-life 1 as a cynical like yeah Whatever this game and after about the first hour of playing it and I've got you know I've progressed through the game for a while I was Gordon Freeman and I was scared shitless that the military is gonna come and kill me.

558
00:35:30,771 --> 00:35:35,930
Scott: Yeah, half-life 2 is just that and more like parts of the game aren't as good as other parts.

559
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,296
Scott: But yeah, just wow.

560
00:35:37,738 --> 00:35:38,240
Scott: Holy shit.

561
00:35:38,401 --> 00:35:40,310
Scott: You haven't played half-life 2 the single-player.

562
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:48,449
Rym: damn Now if we're talking multiplayer Honestly, I love natural selection and I love counter-strike.

563
00:35:48,469 --> 00:35:51,550
Rym: and We're not gonna talk about tribes - we'll do a whole show.

564
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:55,142
Rym: I was gonna talk about tribes - tribes - is the best game ever.

565
00:35:55,282 --> 00:35:55,804
Scott: Holy shit.

566
00:35:55,824 --> 00:35:57,650
Scott: You just can't play just doesn't exist anymore.

567
00:35:57,751 --> 00:35:58,438
Scott: It's the problem.

568
00:35:58,579 --> 00:35:59,610
Rym: Yeah, whiners ruined it.

569
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:02,781
Scott: It's like you can still play Megaman - you can still play half-life.

570
00:36:02,801 --> 00:36:06,776
Rym:  you can't play tribes - actually There are some servers out there.

571
00:36:07,038 --> 00:36:08,766
Scott: Yeah, but it's not the same as it was.

572
00:36:08,786 --> 00:36:09,530
Rym: No, it's not.

573
00:36:10,172 --> 00:36:13,444
Rym: I'd like to do a whole show on tribes - I got tribes - the day came out.

574
00:36:13,644 --> 00:36:15,190
Scott: Rym ordered it for me online.

575
00:36:15,311 --> 00:36:16,142
Scott: It was in college.

576
00:36:16,162 --> 00:36:16,790
Scott: We had two copies.

577
00:36:16,891 --> 00:36:23,268
Scott: I played it online and The first day that game came out and all those people were playing on a server with like 50 people.

578
00:36:23,308 --> 00:36:24,793
Scott: with my wicked Low-paying.

579
00:36:25,114 --> 00:36:28,343
Scott: that was like the greatest FPS team action ever.

580
00:36:28,383 --> 00:36:31,772
Rym: We walked around the campus for the next week going Pretending.

581
00:36:31,792 --> 00:36:35,909
Rym: we had jetpacks like tribes - all our friends thought we were idiots and then they all bought the game.

582
00:36:36,572 --> 00:36:40,809
Scott: God tribes - is just so freaking terrific multiplayer game.

583
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:44,850
Rym: We would come home from class and just start playing like I'd come home and start playing.

584
00:36:45,171 --> 00:36:46,819
Rym: Scott would come home from class and start playing.

585
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,169
Rym: I look up at the clock and turn the game off and go to class.

586
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:51,558
Rym: then I'd come back and start playing again and he'd still be playing.

587
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,180
Scott: Yep.

588
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:54,830
Scott: The thing is you can't play tribes - anymore.

589
00:36:54,911 --> 00:36:59,719
Scott: I mean, it's free now if you want to if you want to try it But it's just not the same as it was.

590
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:00,722
Scott: there aren't enough people.

591
00:37:00,803 --> 00:37:02,730
Scott: They don't play the same way they used to play.

592
00:37:02,992 --> 00:37:04,301
Scott: It's just not the same now.

593
00:37:04,402 --> 00:37:05,410
Rym: I've got a crazy idea.

594
00:37:05,591 --> 00:37:09,750
Scott: I would pay a lot of money to bring tribes to back or get another game going.

595
00:37:09,871 --> 00:37:12,590
Scott: That was like just basically tribes - all right.

596
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:24,604
Rym: so all of you out there who listen to GeekNights if you either one liked tribes - or - might think you might like tribes - check it out and If enough of you want us to we'll put up some sort of server somewhere.

597
00:37:24,624 --> 00:37:24,764
Rym: where?

598
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,069
Scott: where are we gonna put up a server?

599
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:26,451
Rym: I don't know.

600
00:37:26,471 --> 00:37:27,294
Rym: I'll get another hosting.

601
00:37:27,315 --> 00:37:28,680
Scott: All right, it's all you.

602
00:37:28,841 --> 00:37:36,547
Rym: we'll do something because if enough of you want to play and We you know, we can play tribes - old school all the way with the original rule set.

603
00:37:36,567 --> 00:37:40,685
Scott: Mm-hmm That'd be fun, but I don't think it would be easy to get going.

604
00:37:40,986 --> 00:37:41,870
Rym: No, I don't think it would either.

605
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:42,695
Rym: That's why I'm asking.

606
00:37:42,755 --> 00:37:43,238
Scott: I'll tell you what.

607
00:37:43,278 --> 00:37:45,410
Scott: go to the forum and we'll start it tribes to thread.

608
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:52,130
Rym: Yeah, so we're not gonna tribes - is not in the consideration because it was the best game ever, but they ruined it.

609
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,355
Scott: It's no longer playable.

610
00:37:53,436 --> 00:37:56,590
Scott: the game that it that was the best game ever does not exist now.

611
00:37:56,731 --> 00:37:59,230
Rym: Like I said, I like that and counter-strike and natural selection.

612
00:37:59,632 --> 00:38:07,129
Rym: But honestly, I spent more time in my life Playing quick - and all of its mods than I've played any other FPS ever.

613
00:38:07,893 --> 00:38:08,155
Scott: Wow,

614
00:38:08,718 --> 00:38:28,609
Rym: I mean I played quake - pretty much from the day It came out online and then lithium deathmatch and then a weapons factory action quake weapons of destruction action quake version - weapons or a weapons factory version - in fact I contend that weapons factory was better than any incarnation of Team Fortress ever.

615
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:32,289
Scott: Well, Team Fortress is sort of this on and off sort of thing.

616
00:38:33,131 --> 00:38:36,025
Rym: Yeah, I just I have so many good memories of playing that game.

617
00:38:36,045 --> 00:38:48,302
Scott: Mm-hmm Yeah, see when I first actually was able to play FPS is online for real was when I got to college because before then I had a little dial-up so I couldn't really play online so well.

618
00:38:48,402 --> 00:38:50,310
Rym: Yeah, so you kind of missed a whole era there.

619
00:38:50,711 --> 00:38:57,410
Scott: Yeah, but I played Team Fortress classic on the half-life engine and that was really not so great.

620
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:01,370
Scott: I mean it was better than anything I had previously played but it wasn't so great except for the hunted.

621
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:10,329
Scott: The hunting was terrific the hunted if you don't know is basically Counter-strike assault with the VIP trying to get to a checkpoint and then they win but if the VIP dies they lose.

622
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:17,749
Scott: Then some guys are talking about counter-strike and they said oh if you die, you're out and I'm like, oh that sucks I don't want to play something like that.

623
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:23,268
Scott: But then I realized oh you're out for the round and there's an objective and it's quick and I got it.

624
00:39:23,991 --> 00:39:27,970
Scott: Then I played counter-strike probably more than I played any other multiplayer FPS ever.

625
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:37,370
Scott: Yeah, we got really into counter-strike starting right around beta 5, I believe Yeah, the thing is counter-strike like any other multiplayer FPS or really any other multiplayer round based game.

626
00:39:37,431 --> 00:39:44,790
Scott: You can have good rounds and bad rounds, you know It could be painful to play or it could be like the best time you've had playing counter-strike ever.

627
00:39:45,051 --> 00:39:46,434
Rym: We've had some crazy times.

628
00:39:46,755 --> 00:39:53,470
Scott: crazy times, you know when crazy stuff happenings or when your team just clicks and yeah It feels really good.

629
00:39:53,651 --> 00:40:00,270
Rym: Like say you you're the defenders and you're trying to defend the bombsite and you get owned like 20 times in a row.

630
00:40:00,391 --> 00:40:13,512
Rym: They just they run in and they destroy you and then that one time Somehow your team just goes nuts and kills the entire enemy team without taking a loss and the whole server is going WTF WTF hacks or That's like.

631
00:40:13,552 --> 00:40:14,415
Rym: that's that's gold.

632
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:19,350
Scott: That's always chat actually hurt counter-strike a little bit, you know, yeah, it helped and hurt.

633
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:24,734
Scott: I mean, I think it made the game different and a lot of the end and a lot of the changes to the engine and Stuff change things.

634
00:40:24,774 --> 00:40:26,359
Rym: Well, the game was often broken.

635
00:40:26,479 --> 00:40:29,670
Scott: I mean was often broken, but sometimes when it was broken it was more fun.

636
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:31,558
Rym: Yeah, except when they first introduced the p90.

637
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:34,190
Rym: Yeah, it was basically a death machine.

638
00:40:34,792 --> 00:40:38,445
Scott: I remember a time when there was no cheating like way early on.

639
00:40:38,485 --> 00:40:41,577
Rym: Yeah, all you kids out there Yeah, people used to not cheat.

640
00:40:41,638 --> 00:40:44,510
Scott: when you play counter-strike beta 7 there was no cheating.

641
00:40:45,232 --> 00:40:45,773
Scott: They just didn't.

642
00:40:45,994 --> 00:40:47,057
Scott: you'd no one cheated.

643
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:50,186
Scott: they were just people were good and everyone got about.

644
00:40:50,306 --> 00:40:51,570
Scott: you know, pretty good scores.

645
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:53,229
Scott: That was the times.

646
00:40:53,918 --> 00:41:01,830
Rym: Yeah, well see Scott I'll just point out you know that there's an entire era of FPS gaming way before that when I was in high school.

647
00:41:01,931 --> 00:41:02,173
Rym: Oh, yeah.

648
00:41:02,456 --> 00:41:03,990
Rym: Oh, yeah, cuz thing is I was really lucky.

649
00:41:04,111 --> 00:41:06,230
Rym: I can't pretend that this was because I was awesome.

650
00:41:06,591 --> 00:41:08,277
Rym: It was just luck of where I happen to live.

651
00:41:08,718 --> 00:41:16,770
Rym: But basically I had broadband since I was a freshman in high school Like we got some of the first broadband connections in the state of Michigan.

652
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:21,142
Rym: So basically me and my friend we got cable modems because we begged our parents.

653
00:41:21,544 --> 00:41:25,277
Rym: It was like 50 bucks a month and I got pings of like 20.

654
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:26,322
Rym: I mean people.

655
00:41:27,025 --> 00:41:27,970
Rym: no one knew what to make of it.

656
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:33,825
Rym: I connect to a server and I have a ping of like, you know 20 25 and most people had dial-up and pings of like three or four hundred.

657
00:41:34,427 --> 00:41:38,882
Rym: and back then High ping meant death because ping was not dealt with at all.

658
00:41:39,143 --> 00:41:41,269
Rym: You just lagged that far behind in the game.

659
00:41:42,731 --> 00:41:50,133
Rym: But I played quake 2 weapons factory like religiously and Once again, no one cheated.

660
00:41:50,173 --> 00:41:50,294
Rym: like.

661
00:41:50,314 --> 00:41:52,720
Rym: the idea of cheating back then was just unheard of.

662
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:55,402
Rym: The thing is it was difficult to play.

663
00:41:55,503 --> 00:42:01,203
Rym: FPS is back then like, you know You play I don't quake 3 or whatever doom 3 and you can just bind keys to whatever.

664
00:42:01,725 --> 00:42:03,330
Rym: back then you couldn't do anything.

665
00:42:03,551 --> 00:42:11,150
Rym: You had to write scripts to take care of your key bindings at all times like complex difficult to manage scripts to make the game work.

666
00:42:11,671 --> 00:42:14,762
Scott: Yeah scripts that you really weren't supposed to have to write ever.

667
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:15,465
Scott: Yeah.

668
00:42:15,686 --> 00:42:18,242
Rym: I'm not saying that was good I'm just saying that's the way it was.

669
00:42:18,262 --> 00:42:19,993
Rym: Yeah, it is definitely I still have.

670
00:42:20,233 --> 00:42:31,068
Rym: I had a keyboard that I used all the way through RIT till it finally died that had all the all This marker writing over it as to what was bound to what key for different classes and I had scripts to go along with that keyboard.

671
00:42:32,714 --> 00:42:34,860
Scott: So now I'm also gonna mention natural selection.

672
00:42:35,101 --> 00:42:39,457
Scott: natural selection is a half-life 1 mod where it's kind of like an RTS Alien vs.

673
00:42:39,538 --> 00:42:40,930
Scott: Predator also FPS.

674
00:42:41,311 --> 00:42:47,790
Rym: Yeah, imagine RTS where one guy's the commander and he's doling out troops and whatever but all the troops are guys playing an FPS.

675
00:42:47,811 --> 00:42:47,935
Rym: Yeah

676
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:58,950
Scott: the thing about natural selection is that if you gave me a choice between a really good game of natural selection and a really Good game of counter-strike the game of natural selection probably more fun and more awesome

677
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:01,157
Rym: Mostly because of the community around it the

678
00:43:01,217 --> 00:43:05,230
Scott: problem with well and because the game itself I think is just inherently.

679
00:43:05,412 --> 00:43:07,088
Rym: I think the communities were really did it for me?

680
00:43:07,931 --> 00:43:14,192
Scott: but the thing about natural selection is it's so much harder to get a good game of natural selection than it is to get a Game of counter-strike.

681
00:43:14,212 --> 00:43:23,700
Scott: and I just because there are fewer players because it requires so much more effort and coordination and like one Asshole can ruin it one asshole can ruin it.

682
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,350
Scott: in counter-strike one asshole just dies every round You know or he team kills and then he dies the next round.

683
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:31,604
Rym: Yeah That's one thing counter-strike never had.

684
00:43:31,665 --> 00:43:36,830
Rym: was that Deeply rooted sense of community which may sound silly for a video game, but I swear to you it was there.

685
00:43:37,215 --> 00:43:38,170
Rym: I mean natural selection.

686
00:43:38,752 --> 00:43:43,088
Rym: It was a small group so you'd see the same people over and over and you'd start to learn who was who.

687
00:43:43,169 --> 00:43:46,719
Rym: and you'd see A guy and you know that guy always plays bender waves whenever he does.

688
00:43:46,779 --> 00:43:57,062
Rym: Well, everyone just called him bender or that guy sucks and you'd know like you'd know the guy and your friends with him, but you just know we sucked from his name and In the old old days.

689
00:43:57,082 --> 00:43:57,790
Rym: It was the same way.

690
00:43:57,871 --> 00:44:02,769
Rym: everyone kind of knew each other and Everyone was kind of cool with each other and they talked outside of the game and you know who was who?

691
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:05,198
Rym: You don't really have that in counter-strike.

692
00:44:05,841 --> 00:44:07,590
Rym: You just play with random schmucks constantly.

693
00:44:08,331 --> 00:44:10,821
Scott: Yeah, it's like sometimes I feel like I should go get.

694
00:44:10,941 --> 00:44:13,190
Scott: one of these newfangled FPS is like the battlefield.

695
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:22,830
Scott: There's something like that and you know get some people together with like a clan of non Schmucks and really try to turn it into what it was in the old days, but it's so much effort.

696
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:26,589
Scott: It's not the same and I'd had to buy a better computer and it's just you know.

697
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:27,492
Scott: I don't know.

698
00:44:27,512 --> 00:44:30,842
Scott: It's just so much trying just to get something that came easily before.

699
00:44:30,862 --> 00:44:32,005
Scott: I don't want to.

700
00:44:32,205 --> 00:44:33,790
Scott: I'd feel bad doing that.

701
00:44:34,053 --> 00:44:35,269
Rym: Yeah, I mean natural selection.

702
00:44:35,651 --> 00:44:39,950
Rym: I remember one of the defining moments for us was a game ended and I forget who had won.

703
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:54,570
Rym: but we're back in the team room, which is the the start room where basically everyone gets together and then you pick what team you want to be on whatever and everyone's standing there waiting for the next round to start and Everyone just started dancing and raving and playing music into the microphone and flashing their flashlights.

704
00:44:55,152 --> 00:45:00,370
Rym: And then in this room, don't ask me why there was a table and on table was a piece of cheese.

705
00:45:00,612 --> 00:45:01,949
Scott: I was gonna talk about the cheese.

706
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:03,318
Rym: All right, fine.

707
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,250
Rym: You can talk about the cheese.

708
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:08,270
Scott: There's a piece of cheese on the table and some guy says let's pile on the cheese.

709
00:45:08,533 --> 00:45:16,399
Scott: He gets on top of the cheese a guy gets on top of him a guy gets on top of him and everyone's jumping up and down on top of the Cheese in a giant pyramid of people meanwhile and aliens.

710
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,770
Rym: one guy goes into the game to try to start and he comes back out.

711
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:21,177
Rym: He's like and he sees the pile.

712
00:45:21,197 --> 00:45:23,730
Rym: He's like what WTF are you guys doing?

713
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,418
Rym: Don't you want to play the game?

714
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:27,210
Rym: and we're like forget you cheese.

715
00:45:29,511 --> 00:45:36,225
Rym: What kind of game can you have where everyone is more interested in hanging out with each other and piling up on cheese than they Aren't actually playing the game?

716
00:45:36,286 --> 00:45:43,850
Scott: one time I joined an NS server and there's one alien and he was playing Techno music and dancing around the ready room and he was all alone.

717
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:44,755
Scott: Everyone else is playing.

718
00:45:45,298 --> 00:45:47,590
Scott: so I went into the game for a minute and the game was kind of bleh.

719
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:54,013
Scott: So I'm back to the ready room and started dance around and bit by bit more people started going to the ready room as people Leaving the game.

720
00:45:54,033 --> 00:46:00,436
Scott: where the game ended people came to the ready room and started the techno with us and then after we've done technically We started a real game.

721
00:46:00,476 --> 00:46:01,843
Scott: That was actually good now.

722
00:46:01,903 --> 00:46:03,250
Rym: We don't really have a category for this.

723
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:10,389
Rym: I mean, it's in the bimani category, but dance dance revolution has affected us in profound ways.

724
00:46:12,031 --> 00:46:13,797
Scott: Yeah, I should get back into that.

725
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:14,479
Rym: Yeah.

726
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,081
Rym: Yeah.

727
00:46:15,382 --> 00:46:17,409
Rym: I mean basically we'd never heard a DDR.

728
00:46:18,012 --> 00:46:19,597
Rym: We had no idea about it.

729
00:46:19,638 --> 00:46:27,910
Rym: and we get to RIT and this guy has this dance man And he's dancing and there's arrows on the screen and that looked like the dumbest thing in the world to me.

730
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:29,959
Rym: Yeah, we both said this is the dumbest thing ever.

731
00:46:30,482 --> 00:46:32,230
Scott: It's like some little kids game or some shit.

732
00:46:32,454 --> 00:46:33,249
Scott: I'm not doing this.

733
00:46:33,752 --> 00:46:37,250
Rym: So then Scott goes off to play Dungeons & Dragons with all these people, but I had nothing to do.

734
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:38,054
Rym: I wasn't in that game.

735
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:40,204
Rym: So I'd started trying to play this dancing game.

736
00:46:40,244 --> 00:46:41,048
Rym: I had nothing better to do.

737
00:46:42,011 --> 00:46:51,244
Rym: Four hours later they get out of their D&D game and I'm still dancing and Scott says something to the effect of what the hell that Game looked stupid and I just looked at him and said try it and see what you say

738
00:46:51,404 --> 00:46:53,712
Scott: and I try anything once To make sure

739
00:46:54,033 --> 00:46:57,685
Rym: and sure enough not too long after I got a ps1 modded.

740
00:46:57,765 --> 00:47:04,609
Rym: it got the import games We bought dance mats we duct-taped them permanently to the floor in our apartment and we play DDR every day.

741
00:47:05,232 --> 00:47:10,231
Scott: Yeah, the thing is DDR isn't what it used to be just like it seems like everything that's our favorite isn't what it used to Be?

742
00:47:10,873 --> 00:47:12,478
Rym: yes that you know what that means.

743
00:47:12,578 --> 00:47:16,109
Rym: It either means the world is changing or we're crotchety old men.

744
00:47:16,169 --> 00:47:17,657
Scott: now I think we're just crotchety.

745
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:20,050
Rym: Yeah, I think we are because we used to be punk kids.

746
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:29,944
Scott: The way we experienced these things when they were new and awesome or you know in our youth younger days Was the way they should be experienced and for the most awesome.

747
00:47:29,964 --> 00:47:33,599
Scott: and the way we experienced them now Isn't the same as the way we experienced them then.

748
00:47:33,639 --> 00:47:36,150
Scott: so we don't like him as much now as we did then.

749
00:47:36,291 --> 00:47:38,212
Rym: Well consider this DDR.

750
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:43,590
Rym: we played it for years where we had dance mats in our apartment and that was and other than other people's apartments.

751
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:47,808
Rym: That was the only time I could ever play it and no one really was good at it because no one had it.

752
00:47:48,855 --> 00:47:56,173
Rym: Then one day an Arcade machine appeared near us Like we'd always wanted an arcade machine we never even like.

753
00:47:56,313 --> 00:48:04,290
Rym: once I'd seen an arcade machine at Cedar Point when I went back home to go on vacation with my family and One day our friend Scott Johnson calls us.

754
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:19,170
Rym: he says I heard there's a DDR machine at blah blah blah and we I just hung up because we were on our way to that place immediately and Our whole group of friends congregated at this arcade and like a shining altar in the middle of the room is a dance dance revolution.

755
00:48:19,351 --> 00:48:20,396
Rym: Fourth mix machine.

756
00:48:20,778 --> 00:48:21,984
Scott: fourth mix was where it was at.

757
00:48:22,305 --> 00:48:23,230
Rym: We about cried.

758
00:48:23,511 --> 00:48:26,844
Rym: I bought like $50 worth of tokens and I used them all.

759
00:48:26,965 --> 00:48:28,250
Scott: that was the summer of dancing.

760
00:48:28,592 --> 00:48:30,970
Rym: Yep, that was the summer of dancing in the summer of Puerto Rico.

761
00:48:31,251 --> 00:48:35,505
Scott: Yep, we all we did that summer was dance dance revolution in Puerto Rico the board game.

762
00:48:35,786 --> 00:48:35,967
Rym: Yep.

763
00:48:36,027 --> 00:48:36,830
Rym: That was a good summer.

764
00:48:37,211 --> 00:48:43,530
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I mean it does this community and happiness and fun around that one machine was just so fantastic.

765
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:46,180
Rym: Yep, like yeah, everyone knew everyone who played on the machine.

766
00:48:46,301 --> 00:48:47,586
Rym: Everyone's real polite to each other.

767
00:48:47,907 --> 00:48:48,650
Rym: No one was a jerk.

768
00:48:49,071 --> 00:48:51,801
Rym: Everyone was about the same level of skill.

769
00:48:51,861 --> 00:48:56,660
Scott: Yeah, there weren't any like, you know Asians Get it out to be racist or anything.

770
00:48:56,881 --> 00:48:57,303
Rym: get an epic.

771
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:58,590
Rym: Kaya nub exactly.

772
00:48:58,832 --> 00:49:04,424
Scott: There were none of those guys doing like the crazy hard stuff Like who look at me I'm so much better and no smelly people.

773
00:49:04,504 --> 00:49:05,770
Rym: and now there were smelly people.

774
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:08,683
Rym: I think you're that's definitely a rose-tinted glass right there.

775
00:49:09,045 --> 00:49:11,395
Rym: It might be now I remember some smelly people.

776
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:14,709
Rym: All right, and there were the people who were really good, but they weren't jerks about it.

777
00:49:15,091 --> 00:49:17,261
Scott: Yeah, because they're not like good at that one time.

778
00:49:17,281 --> 00:49:19,129
Scott: We tried to play in New York and they were jerks about it.

779
00:49:19,431 --> 00:49:20,435
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

780
00:49:20,898 --> 00:49:26,125
Rym: Yeah, though the thing is there was a point at which we got really good But that was after you know a year of playing every day now.

781
00:49:26,145 --> 00:49:26,890
Scott: We're not so good anymore.

782
00:49:27,292 --> 00:49:31,930
Rym: No, I remember this one time we were playing in our apartment and we always play in our boxers or like shorts.

783
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:37,490
Rym: Just cuz you know you get hot playing DDR and it was summer and these drunks are standing outside.

784
00:49:37,652 --> 00:49:38,930
Scott: I have been like four or five times.

785
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:45,078
Rym: Yeah And they see us in there and they couldn't figure out what we were doing and they'd start gathering a crowd and they start yelling Or cheering.

786
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,069
Rym: one guy mooned us.

787
00:49:47,051 --> 00:49:47,392
Scott: Awesome.

788
00:49:47,674 --> 00:49:51,130
Rym: Yeah, one time these drunk sorority girls wandered in and wanted to play with us.

789
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:52,533
Scott: I don't know why we didn't take advantage of them.

790
00:49:52,955 --> 00:49:55,581
Rym: Yeah, because we were more interested in playing DDR at the time.

791
00:49:56,002 --> 00:49:56,925
Scott: Yeah playing DDR.

792
00:49:56,945 --> 00:50:04,276
Rym: I Don't know there's something about a drunk sorority girl who comes into your apartment Randomly and starts hitting on you.

793
00:50:04,316 --> 00:50:09,355
Rym: that really kind of turns you off a little especially when they're not so hot More that they were so drunk.

794
00:50:09,415 --> 00:50:10,257
Rym: It was not good.

795
00:50:10,497 --> 00:50:13,365
Rym: Yeah, but they were really into DDR, I guess.

796
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:19,019
Rym: Oh, well, yeah Now DDR, I mean DDR machines were so rare.

797
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:22,170
Rym: and then suddenly there was an explosion and there were DDR machines everywhere.

798
00:50:22,792 --> 00:50:31,150
Rym: and then that next summer we went to Wildwood, New Jersey with Scott Johnson our good friend and all of our other friends and There were like 10 DDR machines on the boardwalk.

799
00:50:32,015 --> 00:50:32,719
Scott: Yeah, but there wasn't.

800
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:41,612
Rym: you didn't have the community around those DDR machine No But what you did have were slack-jawed tourists who had never seen anything like that before and no one knew how to dance on it Except us.

801
00:50:42,495 --> 00:50:45,484
Rym: and they go ooh, and ah, yeah, that's a good feeling.

802
00:50:45,544 --> 00:50:49,190
Rym: It's a silly feeling but it's a good feeling Yeah, but now it doesn't work anymore.

803
00:50:49,431 --> 00:50:55,747
Rym: Now every machine there is an 8th mix machine and it's all these epic kaya nub kids playing DDR.

804
00:50:55,787 --> 00:51:00,558
Scott: Yep Uh Why does everything have to go away?

805
00:51:00,598 --> 00:51:01,060
Scott: That's good.

806
00:51:01,523 --> 00:51:02,950
Rym: Why do we have to get old and crotchety?

807
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:03,612
Scott: I don't know.

808
00:51:04,076 --> 00:51:07,154
Rym: I mean if we were young punk kids, we'd probably be talking up Whatever the new great thing is.

809
00:51:07,576 --> 00:51:07,817
Scott: Yep.

810
00:51:08,479 --> 00:51:16,750
Rym: The new great thing is in the groove - yep I consider it the spiritual successor to Dance Dance Revolution because DDR is basically dead as far as I'm concerned.

811
00:51:17,192 --> 00:51:20,122
Rym: Yeah, well mostly because we can't find a fourth mix machine anywhere anymore.

812
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:22,130
Scott: You mean a fourth mix plus machine?

813
00:51:22,453 --> 00:51:24,270
Rym: Yeah, yeah, so it has the kpop songs.

814
00:51:24,432 --> 00:51:25,406
Scott: There was a fourth mix.

815
00:51:25,507 --> 00:51:27,537
Scott: well No The fourth mix has the kpop songs.

816
00:51:27,597 --> 00:51:30,308
Scott: fourth mix plus has the extra mix type songs and such.

817
00:51:30,429 --> 00:51:33,565
Rym: of course I have a special place in my heart for Dance Dance Revolution.

818
00:51:33,645 --> 00:51:34,470
Rym: third mix Korean.

819
00:51:34,932 --> 00:51:37,342
Rym: Yeah, because mainly there was a machine on the boardwalk.

820
00:51:37,563 --> 00:51:39,129
Rym: It was a quarter for five songs.

821
00:51:40,052 --> 00:51:43,049
Rym: Alright, once again, we could talk about this topic forever and we're gonna stop now.

Scott: Yeah, I mean I could talk about you know favorite RPG type games.

824
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:55,519

825
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,424
Rym: Yeah, Scott's real big into the shmups.
