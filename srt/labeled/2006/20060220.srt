00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,775
Scott: It's Monday February 20th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,815 --> 00:00:15,199
Scott: We do a roundup of tech news.

3
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:17,097
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:17,964 --> 00:00:29,012
Rym: so I just got back from Katsucon and I'm not gonna talk a bunch about it today because it doesn't really fit into side tech and we're really trying to keep on topic for each of the different days a little bit

5
00:00:29,253 --> 00:00:34,780
Scott: especially when we Start doing the separate feeds and people's might start heavily subscribing to them.

6
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,140
Scott: We don't want to like have people subscribing to this expecting video games all the time.

7
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:44,900
Scott: And then oh we talked about anime that day because we were whatever on a whim and then they'll be kind of disappointed.

8
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:48,510
Rym: Well that and Katsucon was freaking fantastic.

9
00:00:48,911 --> 00:00:52,220
Rym: I mean it was an amazing con at a wonderful awesome crazy time.

10
00:00:52,601 --> 00:00:56,756
Rym: I have at least three or four full podcasts to talk about worth of content from this con.

11
00:00:56,796 --> 00:00:59,998
Scott: if I really wanted to I don't Think we're gonna give you three or four podcasts to talk about.

12
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:00,180
Scott: well

13
00:01:00,522 --> 00:01:07,860
Rym: But I'm doing a full con report on Wednesday anime day And I'm going to talk a lot about the video gaming that happened at Katsucon tomorrow

14
00:01:08,586 --> 00:01:09,313
Scott: Mm-hmm

15
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:24,697
Rym: and Various other things and I would have kind of wanted to talk about more right now But I'm gonna be strangely silent through most of this podcast at least as silent as I can make myself be Mostly due to the fact that I caught some sort of throat infection at Katsucon,

16
00:01:24,838 --> 00:01:26,541
Scott: so it wasn't Perfect

17
00:01:27,164 --> 00:01:32,693
Rym: and it well it was perfect because this didn't affect me until after the con But it's actually painful for me to talk right now.

18
00:01:32,874 --> 00:01:33,800
Rym: I didn't even go to work today.

19
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:39,974
Scott: well, we'll see what happens because Next week is the New York Comic Con.

20
00:01:39,994 --> 00:01:43,649
Rym: Yeah, so All right, so you had something today.

21
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,740
Rym: well for the weekend while I was out of town.

22
00:01:45,861 --> 00:01:47,380
Scott: Oh a lot of shit happened over the weekend.

23
00:01:47,380 --> 00:02:00,456
Scott: We were out of town But most of it was just me getting my personal affairs in order or more in order than I had them before And I finished that today by getting my car inspected which past inspection being a brand new car.

24
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:01,960
Rym: No yeah, I'm not surprised.

25
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:08,501
Scott: Yeah, so um another thing happened is this podcast I listened to which It's.

26
00:02:08,622 --> 00:02:10,148
Scott: it's actually scarily popular.

27
00:02:10,187 --> 00:02:22,031
Scott: It's comic geek speak, and it's all about comic books and whatever and You know actually their forums are really awesome a lot more awesome than ours, so That's mainly because they have a bunch of people there.

28
00:02:22,052 --> 00:02:23,460
Scott: I wish we had that many people.

29
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,230
Rym: Yeah, though don't don't take that the wrong way.

30
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,040
Rym: the people who are on our forums now are awesome.

31
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:32,500
Scott: Oh, yeah, the thing is it's like What their forums are is like our forums if they were big?

32
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,000
Scott: That's why I want more people in our forum because we know you're all listening.

33
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:38,799
Rym: I can see you in feed burner, but you're not in the forums.

34
00:02:39,703 --> 00:02:40,432
Scott: Yeah, they're awesome.

35
00:02:40,472 --> 00:02:43,627
Scott: So whatever Yeah, but you get to the forums.

00:03:00,573 --> 00:03:01,520
Scott: Yeah, it looks like the forum.

43
00:03:02,942 --> 00:03:04,329
Scott: You want to know what it's gonna look like.

44
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:04,912
Scott: look at the farm.

45
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:06,259
Scott: All right, it's enough of that.

Scott: Yeah And my screen name there as Everywhere else is a PR ECHE.

51
00:03:25,776 --> 00:03:37,139
Rym: Yeah, it's weird Like my screen name is basically Rym But it's also the name I use in the real world like everyone in the world calls me Rym Except for old relatives who don't really know better and a couple people at work.

52
00:03:38,181 --> 00:03:39,325
Rym: Yeah, don't that's a long story.

53
00:03:39,365 --> 00:03:53,408
Scott: Don't anyway, that's been my screen name online for Almost ten years at least nine years probably ten I don't even know and it's I'm the only one who uses it as far as I know and It's me if you see that name somewhere.

54
00:03:53,448 --> 00:03:53,769
Scott: It's me.

55
00:03:54,371 --> 00:04:00,680
Scott: The thing is is until podcasting It's never been pronounced and I'm gonna spare you the story of where it came from.

56
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:08,253
Scott: You can read all about that like in my about page on my blog or something I don't know what somewhere or if we ever do our origin story podcast.

57
00:04:08,273 --> 00:04:10,320
Scott: Yeah, it's somewhere on my blog somewhere.

58
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,065
Rym: He was bit by a radioactive spider.

59
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:20,027
Scott: Yep, and then all of a sudden my screen name appeared before my eyes in my you know radioactive Hallucination haze.

60
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:20,812
Rym: Yeah.

61
00:04:20,911 --> 00:04:31,932
Scott: Anyway anyway, so they The cool guys in the comic podcast we're doing some casual shoutouts to other podcasts and they shout it out to us Which was nice because they didn't have to do that.

62
00:04:31,992 --> 00:04:40,178
Scott: I didn't ask them to you know They're cool, and I figured I was you know, kind of an asshole in their forms, but I'm kind of an asshole kind of an asshole everywhere.

63
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:46,946
Scott: Yeah, I Really wasn't that big an asshole.

64
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:52,270
Scott: most of my ass oneness was when they were talking about like the big comic Crossovers and all the things they like so much.

65
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:56,491
Rym: I'm like those things all suck because they do But it's got real good at that sort of thing.

66
00:04:56,732 --> 00:05:00,648
Rym: Yeah, if you guys ever meet him in person I mean, we're all good friends, but Scott's an asshole.

67
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,274
Scott: Yeah, you're an asshole, too.

68
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:02,695
Rym: Yeah.

69
00:05:02,756 --> 00:05:02,876
Rym: Yeah.

70
00:05:02,896 --> 00:05:04,020
Rym: I'm just different kind of asshole.

71
00:05:04,322 --> 00:05:11,086
Rym: Yeah, the goatee can okay Yeah, yeah, so Why are we so silly today?

72
00:05:11,106 --> 00:05:13,277
Scott: I don't know but I'm gonna finish this story real quick.

73
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:14,845
Rym: Don't worry I swear to all you guys.

74
00:05:14,965 --> 00:05:21,544
Rym: once the thing of the day music comes in we're gonna straighten ourselves up That's for sure and just do the show, okay Really?

75
00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:30,789
Scott: Yeah, really, but six so Because it's a podcast and I'm no longer You know just typing things they had to.

76
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,243
Scott: this is like the third time they've had to do this because I've sent them email before And stuff.

77
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,919
Scott: they've tried to pronounce my screen name.

78
00:05:39,141 --> 00:05:42,830
Scott: They had to say it and it's never really been said.

79
00:05:42,851 --> 00:05:48,286
Scott: and I really never said it because it's an online Text name.

80
00:05:48,447 --> 00:05:52,119
Rym: now the first time I saw it which was when we were freshmen at RIT.

81
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:58,819
Rym: God what four five six seven years ago six years ago six years ago seven who knows a long time going on.

82
00:05:58,859 --> 00:05:59,140
Scott: seven.

83
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:01,993
Scott: See when it comes to uh, it'll be seven in like September.

84
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:03,460
Rym: I think God I feel old.

85
00:06:03,701 --> 00:06:16,457
Rym: Anyway, when it comes to any sort of like online communication I am basically J Edgar Hoover and I have logs and transcripts of every I am Conversation I've had going all the way back to when I got ICQ in 1996 and I'm Richard Nixon.

86
00:06:17,501 --> 00:06:19,819
Scott: I go looking in his logs to find scary things.

87
00:06:20,401 --> 00:06:24,534
Rym: So I remember way back anyway when he messaged me and he asked me like.

88
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:33,023
Rym: he said like he was the guy from this gaming Club we've gotten together with and then I saw his screen name was a presh and I just assumed it was pronounced a presh The first time I saw it.

89
00:06:33,203 --> 00:06:33,364
Rym: Mm-hmm.

90
00:06:33,846 --> 00:06:40,960
Scott: Well, it seems that I never really decided how it should be pronounced and They couldn't seem to figure it out either.

91
00:06:41,382 --> 00:06:45,821
Scott: Like I was hoping really hoping that they would come up with some pronunciation and just be like, yep That's it.

92
00:06:45,902 --> 00:06:47,868
Scott: So then I would say, okay, whatever they said is it?

93
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:51,140
Scott: but they seem to have some trouble just as I do.

94
00:06:51,582 --> 00:06:52,264
Rym: I don't see the trouble.

95
00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:52,887
Rym: It's a presh.

96
00:06:53,691 --> 00:06:54,414
Scott: Oh, okay, whatever.

97
00:06:54,434 --> 00:06:55,498
Rym: I mean what a preshy.

98
00:06:58,341 --> 00:06:59,646
Scott: Who knows it's.

99
00:06:59,726 --> 00:07:02,135
Scott: it's up to a preach.

100
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:02,858
Scott: a I don't know.

101
00:07:02,938 --> 00:07:08,756
Scott: fate fate I Is good.

102
00:07:10,103 --> 00:07:10,485
Scott: What would they?

103
00:07:10,505 --> 00:07:14,824
Scott: let's see phonic phonetically it would be Prey.

104
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:17,949
Rym: It'd be a presh probably because that you would most.

105
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:18,712
Rym: it'd be a preach.

106
00:07:18,752 --> 00:07:20,258
Rym: actually maybe maybe I don't know.

107
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:25,759
Scott: So I started a thread on their forum entitled pronounce my name.

108
00:07:28,021 --> 00:07:32,292
Scott: Let's see, this guy says it should be appreciate without the eight.

109
00:07:32,312 --> 00:07:33,454
Scott: so that would be appreciate.

110
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:40,946
Rym: this person says Appreciate I'll preach it.

111
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:41,548
Scott: Yeah.

112
00:07:42,592 --> 00:07:45,100
Scott: Um, this guy says sounds like aftershave.

113
00:07:46,702 --> 00:07:47,848
Scott: What I don't know.

114
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:50,380
Scott: I appreciate I appreciate a preachy.

115
00:07:52,982 --> 00:07:57,218
Scott: Let's see this guy just posted a picture of the prince thing.

116
00:08:00,225 --> 00:08:01,918
Scott: The next guy says I didn't know.

117
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,794
Scott: Appreciate whatever was pronounced as.

118
00:08:04,814 --> 00:08:10,040
Scott: hey What wacky stuff can I do to get out of my incredibly shitty record contract and get lots of PR in the process?

119
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,228
Scott: That was in response to the prince logo.

120
00:08:12,388 --> 00:08:14,780
Scott: Yeah, I figured this guy says I always thought it was a presh.

121
00:08:15,701 --> 00:08:16,768
Rym: See, that's not me though.

122
00:08:17,352 --> 00:08:18,479
Scott: It's pronounced a fur.

123
00:08:22,814 --> 00:08:30,105
Rym: You know what I think what we're gonna have to do is have some sort of pole on the site of how to pronounce it and bind Ourselves to whatever the result.

124
00:08:30,165 --> 00:08:31,710
Scott: no our forum doesn't really have poles.

125
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,577
Scott: I should implement that or get a plug-in.

126
00:08:33,878 --> 00:08:36,668
Scott: this guy It's a the person who said opera che.

127
00:08:37,068 --> 00:08:41,836
Scott: he posted a thumbs up under that and this one says a prey Shay.

128
00:08:43,602 --> 00:08:44,654
Scott: Hmm, I don't know.

129
00:08:46,043 --> 00:08:47,769
Scott: We need to come to some sort of consensus.

130
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,173
Rym: Yeah, now that it really matters.

131
00:08:49,193 --> 00:08:51,080
Rym: I mean on the show your notice Scott.

132
00:08:51,602 --> 00:08:54,800
Scott: Yeah, that there's a reason for that and this is part of that.

133
00:08:56,365 --> 00:08:58,246
Scott: Plus there was a Forget it.

134
00:08:59,328 --> 00:08:59,998
Scott: What were you gonna say?

135
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:05,140
Scott: I was talking about another podcast where they started out using their online names and they gave up and use their real names.

136
00:09:05,722 --> 00:09:06,225
Rym: See, we're kind of.

137
00:09:06,406 --> 00:09:09,841
Rym: it's weird because you tell a lot of people think that Rym is an online name But it's not.

138
00:09:10,163 --> 00:09:11,106
Rym: I go by that in the real world.

139
00:09:11,126 --> 00:09:12,189
Scott: - yeah, Brandon.

140
00:09:12,591 --> 00:09:13,534
Scott: Yeah named Brandon.

141
00:09:13,815 --> 00:09:15,300
Scott: Yeah, his real name is Brandon.

142
00:09:15,381 --> 00:09:16,638
Scott: Oh my god, call him Brandon.

143
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,084
Scott: Really care the money.

144
00:09:19,104 --> 00:09:28,231
Rym: I mean the only weird thing is there was one guy at RIT who found out my name was Brandon And started calling me that and I didn't notice like.

145
00:09:28,251 --> 00:09:30,257
Rym: I didn't notice but I don't like.

146
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,005
Rym: if someone says Brandon I'm not paying attention.

147
00:09:32,045 --> 00:09:32,588
Rym: I won't look up.

148
00:09:32,628 --> 00:09:34,680
Rym: I don't even really respond to it anymore.

149
00:09:35,421 --> 00:09:39,200
Scott: Yeah, but yeah, it's like sometimes people like hey Scott, what's your middle name?

150
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,932
Scott: And I'm like Lloyd because my mom had this thing with Frank Lloyd Wright.

151
00:09:42,953 --> 00:09:44,096
Scott: So she was like Scott Lloyd Rubin.

152
00:09:44,638 --> 00:09:45,180
Scott: Frank Lloyd, right?

153
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,644
Scott: You know, uh-huh.

154
00:09:46,664 --> 00:09:53,644
Scott: So when I tell that to people they're like, okay Lloyd Lloyd Lloyd Lloyd, and then I'm like, I don't care And then they give up.

155
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:57,520
Scott: yeah, I mean those people call me Ruben but whatever I don't care about that either.

156
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,312
Rym: Yeah, well in high school, I mean some people called me room.

157
00:09:59,352 --> 00:10:00,460
Rym: Some people called me to cost her.

158
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:04,735
Rym: Yeah, the thing is I thought it was weird cuz one time I call you Thomas.

159
00:10:05,358 --> 00:10:07,715
Scott: Yeah Hey Tom, what's up?

160
00:10:08,702 --> 00:10:09,460
Rym: See actually was weird.

161
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:18,920
Rym: but one time in high school senior year after we'd all graduated me and a bunch of friends are sitting around and We've got a bonfire out in the woods and we're just kind of sitting around, you know reminiscing learn a nation.

162
00:10:19,101 --> 00:10:20,208
Rym: This is the end of high school.

163
00:10:20,248 --> 00:10:26,620
Rym: We're all gonna go on with our lives and whatever You know the thing that high school kids do before they actually leave their hometown and go to college.

164
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:33,459
Rym: None of them I'll note none of the people I've been talking about now actually graduated college.

165
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:35,002
Scott: You know what?

166
00:10:35,022 --> 00:10:39,742
Scott: I think you know what I did after high school before I went to college what I went to Israel Mm-hmm.

167
00:10:39,985 --> 00:10:41,620
Scott: I didn't sit around no bonfire in the woods.

168
00:10:41,781 --> 00:10:45,540
Scott: Well, I guess I think we might have done that at one point, but it was a desert not a woods.

169
00:10:46,321 --> 00:10:59,902
Rym: But we were talking about names and it and it came up that half the people I knew called me decoster and the other I've called me Rym and Basically, we came to the conclusion that decoster was just a real good call a guy by that name name Like it.

170
00:10:59,942 --> 00:11:00,787
Rym: just it felt right.

171
00:11:00,807 --> 00:11:01,974
Rym: So people just called me that a lot.

172
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:06,631
Rym: Mm-hmm Alright, yeah, I wasn't really going anywhere with that.

173
00:11:06,651 --> 00:11:08,920
Scott: Yeah, all my names work.

174
00:11:09,321 --> 00:11:13,500
Scott: I don't think people like saying Lloyd and I don't think people like saying my screen name either.

175
00:11:13,982 --> 00:11:19,802
Scott: Yeah, I don't even like saying it's not pleasant it doesn't roll off the tongue, yeah, so yeah I think we'll stick with.

176
00:11:19,822 --> 00:11:20,927
Scott: it's a real toothy word.

177
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:24,180
Rym: Yeah, it's not gonna be GeekNights with Rym and opera che that's for sure.

178
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:39,733
Rym: Alright that music means that it's both things of the day and that we're not gonna be silly anymore for the rest of the show Tonight, of course, that doesn't mean our things of the day aren't silly.

179
00:11:40,395 --> 00:11:43,206
Rym: Yeah, so remember way back I think it was Scott's thing of the day.

180
00:11:43,688 --> 00:11:46,900
Rym: It was a trailer video with voices to Phoenix, right?

181
00:11:47,765 --> 00:11:48,170
Scott: I don't know.

182
00:11:48,372 --> 00:11:49,020
Scott: Did we do that?

183
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:53,060
Scott: I remember we did the one where you type in words and then Phoenix Wright says them.

184
00:11:53,301 --> 00:11:55,207
Scott: I don't know if we actually did the one.

185
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:56,873
Rym: this wasn't a thing of the day then.

186
00:11:56,893 --> 00:12:00,448
Rym: it was definitely something we talked about in The pre broadcast episodes.

187
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,519
Rym: Yeah, because we did talk about it on the show.

188
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:10,900
Scott: basically, there was a flash video that was supposed to be a Preview of what Phoenix Wright gameplay was gonna look like it was from the Tokyo game show.

189
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:20,880
Scott: So if you went to the Tokyo game show to the Capcom booth and looked at the Phoenix Wright display This is the video you saw telling you all about how awesome Phoenix Wright DS was going to be.

190
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,578
Rym: well, someone has translated it and here it is fully translated.

191
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:36,291
Rym: and My favorite part is when it turns out like they're arguing about the DS and the PS or not the PSP the Game Boy Advance and the Game Boy SP and the Edgeworth.

192
00:12:36,352 --> 00:12:44,768
Rym: the prosecuting Attorney doesn't have a DS and everyone else does and then like he's yell something to the judge and the judge looks up and he's like I've got one.

193
00:12:44,888 --> 00:12:46,619
Rym: In fact, I'm playing it right now.

194
00:12:47,042 --> 00:12:48,531
Rym: Yeah, like during the trial.

195
00:12:48,693 --> 00:12:49,860
Scott: and then they're like Edgeworth.

196
00:12:49,961 --> 00:12:53,500
Scott: You have to go and get one right after this trial is over and it's like like I have any choice.

197
00:12:54,162 --> 00:12:54,804
Rym: It's hilarious.

198
00:12:54,884 --> 00:12:55,305
Rym: Watch it.

199
00:12:55,847 --> 00:12:58,595
Rym: Yeah, and buy the game if you can find it.

200
00:12:58,936 --> 00:13:01,584
Scott: if you can find Phoenix Wright Freaking get it.

201
00:13:01,704 --> 00:13:03,594
Rym: It's going for 50 60 bucks on eBay.

202
00:13:03,614 --> 00:13:04,820
Rym: Yeah, it's hard to find.

203
00:13:05,261 --> 00:13:07,148
Scott: I got some more news on Phoenix Wright tomorrow.

204
00:13:07,188 --> 00:13:07,830
Scott: So we'll hold off.

205
00:13:08,653 --> 00:13:10,399
Scott: All right, my thing of the day.

206
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:16,054
Scott: You might have seen in the past the old cliched, you know, what was it?

207
00:13:16,836 --> 00:13:18,040
Scott: I attacked the darkness.

208
00:13:18,884 --> 00:13:24,805
Scott: I cast magic missile, you know, if you don't know what that is You're lost at the internet.

209
00:13:24,825 --> 00:13:25,327
Scott: go away.

210
00:13:25,348 --> 00:13:26,633
Scott: Yeah, just forget it.

211
00:13:27,054 --> 00:13:31,033
Rym: go home fast forward Whatever if there are any girls there.

212
00:13:31,093 --> 00:13:32,320
Rym: I want to do them.

213
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:42,789
Scott: Yeah so Instead of dragging that back up Someone's made something newer and even worse yet.

214
00:13:43,009 --> 00:14:04,579
Scott: It contains far fewer cliched able repeatable Lines, which I guess is okay, but it's called fear of girls and it's live-action short movie I guess short film of Two guys, they're definitely acting pretending to be the scariest D&D players ever in this.

215
00:14:06,318 --> 00:14:10,820
Rym: The Scariest part is that I've met people just like this at gaming conventions before.

216
00:14:11,901 --> 00:14:12,603
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

217
00:14:12,624 --> 00:14:13,687
Scott: That's true.

218
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:22,353
Scott: I think the funniest bits are the larp bit the Christian Relatives bit compared to the druids.

219
00:14:22,534 --> 00:14:27,888
Scott: He's going to hell He's going to burn Whatever.

220
00:14:28,372 --> 00:14:33,826
Scott: and then the Was the homo Suggestions that they made.

221
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,313
Rym: Oh, yeah the homoerotic nature of their relationship.

222
00:14:36,794 --> 00:14:41,760
Scott: Yeah, but the mast concealed homoerotic nature of their relationship.

223
00:14:43,141 --> 00:14:43,923
Rym: You've got to see it.

224
00:14:44,325 --> 00:14:44,926
Rym: Just watch it.

225
00:14:45,348 --> 00:14:53,539
Scott: Oh my god, if you know anything about scary gamer RPG gamers then this will Disturb and amuse.

226
00:14:54,503 --> 00:14:58,920
Rym: So anyway in the news, like we said, we don't have a particular topic today.

227
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,799
Rym: So instead we're gonna round up all the recent sci-tech kind of news that we have anything to say about.

228
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:05,693
Rym: Expect a lot of opinions.

229
00:15:05,915 --> 00:15:13,809
Scott: Yeah, so Something that's been a trend lately or at least a buzzword lately is pod-fading.

230
00:15:14,597 --> 00:15:16,423
Scott: now Pod-fading it.

231
00:15:16,684 --> 00:15:18,350
Scott: I think they've decided that it.

232
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,799
Scott: I don't know who decided but the the colloquial.

233
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:34,956
Scott: they I don't know even if they can be colloquial, but they have decided that pod-fading means That Someone has started a podcast because they want to try it out and then within ten episodes.

234
00:15:35,357 --> 00:15:36,280
Scott: They just stopped doing it.

235
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:41,600
Scott: It's like someone dips their toe into the pool of podcasting and then pulls it out.

236
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:46,060
Rym: And that's like all those people who make a geocities website and then never update it again.

237
00:15:46,462 --> 00:15:49,257
Scott: It's like all the thousands of people who are like, oh, I'll get a live journal.

238
00:15:49,277 --> 00:15:54,470
Scott: I'll get a blog I'll get it and they just don't continue, you know, it's like a thing They try and then it gets boring and they stop.

239
00:15:54,691 --> 00:15:57,904
Rym: so ten episodes a yep We kick that's ass.

240
00:15:58,446 --> 00:16:00,412
Scott: That's for sure 61 already.

241
00:16:00,432 --> 00:16:03,220
Rym: I'm not even counting the like ten or so pre episodes.

242
00:16:03,381 --> 00:16:04,183
Rym: We did mm-hmm.

243
00:16:04,585 --> 00:16:05,649
Rym: that while I keep mentioning.

244
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,174
Rym: No, you're never gonna hear them.

245
00:16:08,037 --> 00:16:08,920
Scott: We got some of them, right?

246
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:09,722
Rym: I've got them all.

247
00:16:10,063 --> 00:16:12,853
Rym: Yeah, in fact, they're on the internet if you search hard enough.

248
00:16:13,295 --> 00:16:13,797
Scott: Are they really?

249
00:16:13,957 --> 00:16:14,459
Rym: Yeah, they are.

250
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:17,288
Scott: We should sell the access to them or something.

251
00:16:17,568 --> 00:16:18,050
Scott: Yeah someday.

252
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,417
Rym: Maybe we'll give away a CD with all because they're terrible.

253
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:22,240
Scott: Yeah anyway.

254
00:16:24,261 --> 00:16:30,691
Scott: So, I don't know People are like making a special name pod fading for something.

255
00:16:30,752 --> 00:16:34,180
Scott: That is just happens to anything of this nature.

256
00:16:34,942 --> 00:16:38,540
Scott: You know, I don't know what the what the deal is, but people are acting like it's a big problem.

257
00:16:38,901 --> 00:16:46,432
Rym: Yeah, I mean when geocities first offered, you know real space everyone and their mother made like a website for their family Mm-hmm, and then none of those got updated.

258
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:47,257
Rym: most of them disappeared.

259
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:49,459
Scott: Yep I think they're pretty much all gone.

260
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:51,409
Scott: now Even mild geocities site is destroyed.

261
00:16:51,831 --> 00:16:53,720
Rym: mine actually was up until at RIT.

262
00:16:53,880 --> 00:17:02,836
Rym: I needed a place to host something real quick and I remembered I had this account and I found my ass old God-awful website and I promptly deleted it and put a big file there instead.

263
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:06,973
Scott: Mm-hmm Yeah, I just stopped taking care of it.

264
00:17:07,034 --> 00:17:08,200
Scott: And then eventually it was gone.

265
00:17:09,181 --> 00:17:17,839
Scott: I think I had a geocities site and then I moved to crosswinds, which is slower but had more space and then I Eventually put it on like the RIT hosting.

266
00:17:18,941 --> 00:17:22,156
Scott: Then we had the web server in the bedroom and whatever.

267
00:17:22,438 --> 00:17:30,775
Scott: Oh, yeah Yeah but Yeah, I just like to say all you pod faders out there.

268
00:17:30,795 --> 00:17:35,105
Rym: Nice try Happens to everyone except us.

269
00:17:35,827 --> 00:17:39,980
Scott: I think it's just more evidence that as I previously claimed.

270
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,054
Scott: I don't know if I claimed it on the podcast, but my shit talking days are over.

271
00:17:43,214 --> 00:17:45,224
Scott: Well, there you go Yep, don't?

272
00:17:45,285 --> 00:17:55,225
Rym: we've said the word shit talking a lot and I guess well I'll just warn you that that I forget where it came from, but some punker was talking about punk rock one day And I happened to catch it.

273
00:17:55,787 --> 00:18:03,470
Rym: they were yelling at each other and one guy basically accused the other guy of being a shit talker Which isn't really the kind of terminology we tend to use for things.

274
00:18:03,651 --> 00:18:06,000
Scott: I imagine it's someone who talks shit exactly.

275
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,943
Rym: We tend to be very either verbose in our swearing or very to the point about it But never like.

276
00:18:10,983 --> 00:18:15,522
Rym: shit talker is really kind of a. it's more crude than we tend to be unless we're trying to be crude on Purpose.

277
00:18:16,126 --> 00:18:18,440
Scott: but shit talker very much means something specific.

278
00:18:18,661 --> 00:18:28,606
Rym: Yep, because basically the other guy's like what the hell's a shit talker and this other punk in very great detail explains The shit talker is someone who talks shit up But that never does anything.

279
00:18:28,967 --> 00:18:32,480
Scott: as in you talk the talk without walking any walks.

280
00:18:32,781 --> 00:18:35,328
Rym: Yep of walking and we realized that we have.

281
00:18:35,408 --> 00:18:43,039
Rym: we have missed the boat many times where we had an idea and we planned It all out and we just didn't execute it for various stupid reasons.

282
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,248
Scott: Well, we are not shit talkers by definition.

283
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,454
Scott: very often we have talked shit.

284
00:18:48,474 --> 00:18:51,124
Scott: we're be like, oh we're gonna do this Awesome thing.

285
00:18:51,205 --> 00:18:52,555
Scott: I got this really awesome idea.

286
00:18:52,575 --> 00:18:53,099
Scott: I'm gonna do it.

287
00:18:53,441 --> 00:18:55,327
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna do this and then we don't do anything.

288
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:58,840
Scott: We just do shit and we just talk and then we talk about it.

289
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,448
Scott: Yeah, so I you know what?

290
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:02,912
Rym: That's why this podcast is great.

291
00:19:03,193 --> 00:19:04,336
Rym: All we have to do is talk.

292
00:19:04,717 --> 00:19:05,500
Rym: So there's no more shit.

293
00:19:05,982 --> 00:19:17,858
Scott: Yeah, exactly by talking we have avoided our shit talking this And if this weekend of productivity by me is any evidence I have also avoided shit talking in other areas.

294
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:20,934
Rym: so Fair that themes actually coming along.

295
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:24,065
Scott: Yep, so We are shit talkers.

296
00:19:24,105 --> 00:19:26,313
Scott: We are not and shit talkers.

297
00:19:26,353 --> 00:19:27,478
Scott: The pod faders are.

298
00:19:27,498 --> 00:19:30,147
Rym: well You realize that we have to actually make that MMO.

299
00:19:30,188 --> 00:19:32,958
Rym: We've been talking about before we can say anything one day.

300
00:19:32,978 --> 00:19:36,528
Scott: Yeah We're not hundred percent clear yet.

301
00:19:36,548 --> 00:19:38,154
Rym: All right, so what's that next news bit you had about?

302
00:19:38,174 --> 00:19:39,520
Rym: someone stole someone's camera.

303
00:19:40,201 --> 00:19:42,290
Scott: So this lady lost a camera.

304
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:46,225
Scott: I don't know the details of how it was lost and people found it.

305
00:19:46,507 --> 00:19:56,382
Scott: it's apparently these these parents and a kid and it was like this crazy huge news on the internet that someone lost a $500 digital camera and Stay.

306
00:19:56,443 --> 00:19:59,480
Scott: she found the people who found it and they wouldn't give it back.

307
00:20:00,103 --> 00:20:13,690
Scott: they were like we already bought batteries and a memory cards for it and our kid really likes it and we don't want to take it away from him and he has diabetes and Yeah, and she's like well fuck you you suck.

308
00:20:14,211 --> 00:20:15,355
Scott: And yeah, they do suck.

309
00:20:15,896 --> 00:20:17,160
Scott: She's like I want my photos back.

310
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,308
Scott: Give me a memory cards back.

311
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:19,960
Scott: They didn't send her to the memory cards.

312
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,728
Scott: They said they needed them to operate the camera.

313
00:20:21,748 --> 00:20:24,459
Scott: They say copied her pictures to CDs and sent those to her.

314
00:20:25,204 --> 00:20:27,357
Scott: So she's kind of pissed and people on the internet were pissed.

315
00:20:27,438 --> 00:20:31,439
Scott: now I was like, yeah, that sucks those people suck.

316
00:20:31,842 --> 00:20:41,280
Scott: But I posted a comment in one or two places saying You know while those people suck in their assholes and I don't even know even the worst person I know would give the camera back.

317
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:48,647
Scott: Yeah, I don't know a person that bad but you know Finders keepers losers beepers.

318
00:20:48,687 --> 00:20:51,400
Scott: You should be more careful with your stuff if it's that important to you.

319
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,840
Scott: I mean I lose shit all the time and break my own shit all the time.

320
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,667
Scott: I mean when I do I just go up.

321
00:20:56,787 --> 00:20:57,350
Scott: shit happens.

322
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,514
Scott: What are you gonna do?

323
00:20:58,554 --> 00:21:00,758
Scott: I don't get all upset over it It's just not worth it.

324
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:05,960
Rym: I like how I just finished talking about how we're not that crude and you're immediately like yeah shit shit shit shit shit shit.

325
00:21:06,163 --> 00:21:06,899
Scott: Well, that was the point.

326
00:21:07,963 --> 00:21:08,709
Scott: It was on purpose.

327
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:13,980
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure okay Anyway, you know, but Rym here seems to say that no they have to give it back.

328
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,067
Rym: well, keep in mind that this is.

329
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:19,228
Rym: I agree with Scott in that You should do your own due diligence.

330
00:21:19,268 --> 00:21:26,108
Rym: And if you lose something don't expect to get it back, however legally just purely from a legal standpoint.

331
00:21:26,811 --> 00:21:40,019
Rym: if you find property anywhere money, whatever and You can reasonably know or assume that whoever lost it did not intend to lose it You're obligated to turn it into the police or a lost and found or something.

332
00:21:41,272 --> 00:21:43,084
Scott: see The way I was.

333
00:21:43,225 --> 00:21:45,939
Rym: the laws vary a bit from state to state, but that's basically what you have to do.

334
00:21:46,382 --> 00:21:48,380
Scott: Yeah, see if that's true then part of what I said.

335
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,180
Scott: I feel dumb now because I was acting like, you know homeless people pick shit up off the street all the time.

336
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,735
Scott: Are you saying all of them are thieves and I'm kind of like?

337
00:21:55,755 --> 00:21:56,680
Scott: that doesn't make any sense.

338
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:01,780
Scott: If someone leaves something lying around on purpose or by accident, you know, it's just the tough shit rule.

339
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,412
Scott: It sucks, but you should have been yeah, but like what's the line?

340
00:22:04,432 --> 00:22:05,235
Scott: you cared about it?

341
00:22:05,255 --> 00:22:06,300
Scott: You should watch the line.

342
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:11,222
Rym: What if you're in the library and you leave your laptop sitting somewhere while you go to pee you come back and it's gone the Art.

343
00:22:11,243 --> 00:22:20,136
Rym: if you walk up to a laptop and you find it there and it's on and word is open and you take it I mean, yeah, the person should have done their due diligence, but you're still a thief.

344
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:26,100
Scott: Oh, yeah Let's see It's kind of like I kept thinking about the beach because the beach is a place a lot of people lose things, right?

345
00:22:26,501 --> 00:22:31,920
Scott: If I'm walking down the beach and there's an umbrella and a bunch of towels and chairs and books, right?

346
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,900
Scott: Which is what you usually see if we're at the beach, right?

347
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,328
Scott: Obviously those people are in the water.

348
00:22:37,508 --> 00:22:44,483
Scott: Come on, you know and you see people in the water You don't take it because obviously there's someone there It's it's attended.

349
00:22:45,084 --> 00:22:53,259
Scott: if you're walking on the beach and there's I don't know a gold fork just in the sand alone It's yours go for it.

350
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,595
Rym: Yeah, the law is fairly vague on purpose because that way judges get to decide.

351
00:22:56,636 --> 00:23:00,029
Scott: but basically that's good That's good something a judge should decide now.

352
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:01,333
Rym: I have two anecdotes.

353
00:23:01,453 --> 00:23:05,326
Rym: Well, actually three regarding this and that's Well one.

354
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:06,091
Rym: one's real short.

355
00:23:06,514 --> 00:23:15,554
Rym: when I was a little kid We're in Meyers super stores in Michigan buying groceries and I saw a $20 bill on the ground All right, and I picked it up and I didn't say anything about it.

356
00:23:15,996 --> 00:23:16,780
Rym: And then we were in the car.

357
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:20,754
Rym: I said mom I found a $20 bill and she said awesome share it with your brother.

358
00:23:20,794 --> 00:23:23,211
Rym: We'll go to the Toys R Us tomorrow Awesome.

359
00:23:23,576 --> 00:23:25,965
Rym: Yeah So, alright, whatever.

360
00:23:25,985 --> 00:23:28,938
Rym: I technically broke the law, but I was a little kid and whatever.

361
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:29,400
Rym: it's 20 bucks.

362
00:23:30,361 --> 00:23:35,680
Rym: See, I think money is something different because no money follows under the same rules and you have to turn it into the police.

363
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:36,829
Rym: That's my second anecdote.

364
00:23:37,071 --> 00:23:37,555
Scott: It's true.

365
00:23:37,575 --> 00:23:39,645
Scott: It's true But all money.

366
00:23:39,765 --> 00:23:49,420
Scott: unless someone like I has an identifying mark on the money or remembers the serial numbers of their money They can't or remembers the amount because we were at Cedar Point like many years later.

367
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:56,708
Rym: I was still kind of young but we found we were get taking our picture in these like old-time Constantly things.

368
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:56,951
Scott: Yeah.

369
00:23:57,254 --> 00:23:57,678
Rym: Yeah, whatever.

370
00:23:57,698 --> 00:24:02,451
Rym: and We found a plastic baggie with like $300 in it.

371
00:24:02,893 --> 00:24:07,280
Rym: Oh, wow, and I was like, dude We're buying video game in the world.

372
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,619
Scott: Here's the thing is the plastic baggie is like, you know, so guy will plastic baggie had nothing to do with it.

373
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:25,360
Rym: Basically what happens is you have to give it to the police and Then say, you know, I found this here Whatever whoever lost it has an X number of days depends on the state and the town or whatever to try to claim it.

374
00:24:25,904 --> 00:24:27,860
Rym: Now basically you have to identify it in some way.

375
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,864
Rym: So say you lost money.

376
00:24:29,285 --> 00:24:35,841
Rym: you have to say within a reasonable degree of how much money you lost, you know I lost about $300.

377
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:42,242
Rym: So if you claim that you lost about $300 and the police find about $300 they give it to you Mm-hmm.

378
00:24:42,664 --> 00:24:45,738
Rym: Now if no one claims it in X days, they give it back to whoever found it.

379
00:24:46,761 --> 00:24:51,538
Rym: Some states take like a 10% finders fee or whatever, but usually they just give you all the money.

380
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:51,960
Rym: They don't care.

381
00:24:52,444 --> 00:24:53,333
Scott: Yeah, what do they you know?

382
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,234
Scott: We should start calling police station saying we lost a hundred bucks.

383
00:24:57,897 --> 00:24:58,420
Rym: You could do that.

384
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,088
Rym: The problem is odds are no one lost the amount of money.

385
00:25:01,108 --> 00:25:04,860
Scott: You're saying 20 bucks 20 dollar bills falling all over the place.

386
00:25:05,282 --> 00:25:05,845
Rym: Yeah, you know what.

387
00:25:05,885 --> 00:25:07,412
Rym: people generally don't turn that into the police.

388
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:09,625
Scott: Anyway, I know that's the problem I do.

389
00:25:09,847 --> 00:25:11,560
Rym: Well, it depends a lot on the situation.

390
00:25:11,641 --> 00:25:14,400
Scott: It does depend a lot because the third anecdote is at Katsucon.

391
00:25:14,741 --> 00:25:19,520
Rym: I was walking around the dealers room and I found a wad a small amount of money in a wad on the ground.

392
00:25:20,182 --> 00:25:32,859
Rym: I saw it there and I get bent over and I picked it up and I'm looking at it and I'm thinking to myself Wow, if this were three years ago, and I was at a con this would mean I can eat tonight And I wouldn't have given it back to anyone.

393
00:25:33,482 --> 00:25:38,520
Rym: But now that I'm fairly wealthy and you know, I mean we consider ourselves wealthy we can do everything we want to do.

394
00:25:38,942 --> 00:25:45,876
Rym: yep, like we go to cons and we buy food for all the poor fanboys and Well, not look at boys, but the the fangirls.

395
00:25:46,017 --> 00:25:54,503
Rym: Yeah and I see this girl standing there and She's kind of looking at me kind of not and I just I hold it up and I ask her Did you drop this?

396
00:25:55,426 --> 00:25:56,850
Rym: and she hesitated for a second?

397
00:25:57,252 --> 00:26:00,883
Rym: And at this point, I'm a hundred percent certain that it is not In fact her money.

398
00:26:01,285 --> 00:26:04,177
Scott: Yeah, I am also 100% certain and I wasn't even there.

399
00:26:04,639 --> 00:26:08,974
Rym: Yeah Yeah, but the thing is she hesitated and that's the reason I decided.

400
00:26:09,054 --> 00:26:14,856
Rym: all right bullshit, but then she said yeah And because I had no other way to know who's it was and I knew it wasn't mine.

401
00:26:14,916 --> 00:26:15,600
Rym: I just gave it to her.

402
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:17,059
Rym: whatever whatever.

403
00:26:18,241 --> 00:26:20,693
Scott: See, it's like if I found the plastic bag with $300 in it.

404
00:26:20,713 --> 00:26:28,979
Scott: It's like, okay Someone was that like a water park carrying their money in a plastic bag to keep from getting wet And this is all their money for the day.

405
00:26:29,522 --> 00:26:33,220
Scott: I'm gonna turn this in but if I'm walking down the street, there's a $20 bill on the ground.

406
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,025
Scott: Whatever it's mine.

407
00:26:35,407 --> 00:26:37,456
Rym: Well, it's like if a cashier gives me too much change back.

408
00:26:37,516 --> 00:26:38,460
Rym: I'll probably just keep it.

409
00:26:38,662 --> 00:26:39,630
Rym: I probably won't even notice.

410
00:26:40,175 --> 00:26:40,961
Scott: Oh my god That's.

411
00:26:41,122 --> 00:26:42,106
Scott: that's another great story.

412
00:26:42,146 --> 00:26:51,086
Scott: when I was in Boston and I was a middle school my eighth grade we're in Boston and this is the magic card days, right and Basically all we.

413
00:26:51,106 --> 00:26:53,140
Scott: there was a game store in this place in Boston.

414
00:26:53,261 --> 00:26:55,379
Scott: We went to right so we were all about that.

415
00:26:55,702 --> 00:27:02,844
Scott: You pretty much went to go to the game store But we went to get lunch at a pizza place and I gave him a five and they gave me change for a 20.

416
00:27:02,844 --> 00:27:04,656
Scott: That was a whole bunch of packs of magic cards.

417
00:27:04,696 --> 00:27:10,314
Rym: They gave me Yeah, all right, all right that was barely tech news.

418
00:27:10,334 --> 00:27:26,424
Scott: so we'll move on okay, so I don't know how tech savvy everyone is but If you are an administrator at a company you want to make it so that no one can use little USB drives and stuff on The company computers.

419
00:27:26,484 --> 00:27:31,020
Scott: the reason for this is because people will put important company documents on them and leave with them.

420
00:27:31,461 --> 00:27:39,719
Rym: See now I disagree in that if people want to steal your company's secrets like that and they're easily accessible like that Anyway, I can just get them to

421
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:41,109
Scott: Begin with

422
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:46,176
Rym: no not just your security But if your employees would want to do that something's wrong with your company in the first place.

423
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:48,769
Scott: That's also true but the the the situate.

424
00:27:48,790 --> 00:28:02,100
Scott: the specific situation is is that You have someone who is part of their job accesses, you know secure important documents But you don't want them leaving that compute computer that they're using.

425
00:28:03,303 --> 00:28:12,860
Scott: so as an administrator you're responsible to Technologically prevent the documents from leaving that computer, you know, they have to do all the work on the company's machine.

426
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:13,516
Scott: It's all you know.

427
00:28:13,785 --> 00:28:25,359
Rym: Yeah, though I will say that at like as an IT guy and I do do a lot of security work in IT Basically if someone wants to steal something from your company and they work there There's nothing you can do to stop them.

428
00:28:25,763 --> 00:28:27,820
Rym: The only real security when it comes to them.

429
00:28:28,201 --> 00:28:33,060
Rym: The only real security when it comes to documents is making sure your employees don't want to or can't benefit from it.

430
00:28:33,343 --> 00:28:38,520
Scott: Yep, that's true But anyway, it's something that you do want to at least do something to prevent.

431
00:28:38,681 --> 00:28:43,500
Scott: Usually people disable USB in the BIOS because no one's smart enough to turn that back on or something.

432
00:28:44,202 --> 00:29:05,255
Scott: but the latest problem people are talking about is pod slurping where People will come in to your company Plug their iPods in to the company computers run a program that will search for sensitive documents Put them on the iPod and then leave with the iPods to take your sensitive documents away.

433
00:29:05,396 --> 00:29:05,516
Rym: Now.

434
00:29:05,556 --> 00:29:06,620
Rym: This is nothing new.

435
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:10,068
Rym: No, people are making out like iPods of this new threat.

436
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,416
Rym: I will note that in the in the early early 90s.

437
00:29:13,436 --> 00:29:21,839
Rym: I had a game that came on two discs and I basically noticed that there was a lot of free space on the discs.

438
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:24,776
Rym: So I deleted a bunch of game files, whatever.

439
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:38,500
Rym: I basically Resurrand wrap the executable into a Trojan and I made discs that you put them in to install this game and it installs the game And while it's installing it searches your computer for a doc and text files and copies them to the disc.

440
00:29:39,142 --> 00:29:42,351
Rym: Awesome, then they give me the disc back and I have whatever documents they had.

441
00:29:43,254 --> 00:29:44,939
Rym: I made a slurping Trojan in the early 90s.

442
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,278
Rym: This is nothing new.

443
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:52,741
Scott: Yeah, this is a bit of problems ever since floppy disk existed where you could take data away from a computer and carry it with You.

444
00:29:53,202 --> 00:30:02,480
Scott: the thing is is people are talking about it now because you use an iPod to do it and iPods don't look Conspicuous and you don't consider them a security threat when you see them around your company.

445
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:05,620
Scott: It's like, you know at my company everyone has a freaking iPods.

446
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,368
Scott: I mean, I have one co-worker has on the other co-worker has one.

447
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:16,673
Scott: someone upstairs is always sharing iTunes with me, you know but now Administrators have to look at them in a different way.

448
00:30:16,693 --> 00:30:19,045
Scott: I Guess yeah, though.

449
00:30:19,085 --> 00:30:20,912
Rym: The thing is this has always been a problem with the iPod.

450
00:30:21,214 --> 00:30:22,217
Rym: It's basically just a USB hard drive.

451
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:24,625
Scott: Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

452
00:30:24,966 --> 00:30:29,280
Scott: Only the hard drive happens to come with a little decoder chip to play music.

453
00:30:30,222 --> 00:30:35,365
Rym: I mean, I remember a long time ago with the older the PlayStation, you know, it had a Broadband adapter that no one use.

454
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,131
Scott: the PlayStation 2 I think did.

455
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:40,020
Rym: now there was a thing for the PlayStation 1 was there.

456
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,186
Rym: I don't buy them in the Dreamcast.

457
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:42,151
Rym: I think was the Dreamcast?

458
00:30:42,372 --> 00:30:43,598
Scott: the Dreamcast definitely had it.

459
00:30:43,638 --> 00:30:44,614
Rym: Yes I'm pretty sure.

460
00:30:44,675 --> 00:30:51,679
Rym: anyway Someone made a disk that would basically turn your Dreamcast into a network sniffer and it would store data to cards in it.

461
00:30:52,485 --> 00:30:53,800
Scott: Yep, that sounds good.

462
00:30:53,961 --> 00:30:57,040
Rym: So you could just take a Dreamcast somewhere in a company plug it into a network jack and go nuts.

463
00:30:57,401 --> 00:30:59,229
Scott: Dreamcast is really Windows CE computer.

464
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,515
Scott: They hacked the hell out of that thing.

465
00:31:00,756 --> 00:31:03,349
Scott: Mm-hmm There were just so many hacks for the Dreamcast.

466
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,876
Scott: It was a PlayStation emulator.

467
00:31:04,916 --> 00:31:05,600
Scott: at one point even.

468
00:31:06,002 --> 00:31:09,838
Rym: yeah, I mean my whole if I had finished the song yet I play the Rym doesn't care song.

469
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:20,987
Rym: but Security really begins and ends with people and very few technological measures will actually increase your security any substantial way Beyond basic due diligence.

470
00:31:21,348 --> 00:31:24,679
Scott: Yeah, once you pretty much covered all the bases like, huh?

471
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:34,431
Scott: We don't let people just you know send packets into our network randomly and you know, we don't let people run programs They shouldn't be running and all that not.

472
00:31:34,571 --> 00:31:36,720
Scott: everything else is only like slight helps.

473
00:31:37,601 --> 00:31:40,452
Scott: You know, you know blocking iPods only helps you a tiny bit.

474
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,540
Rym: see the thing is people really have a weird.

475
00:31:42,681 --> 00:31:43,688
Rym: I should do a whole show on this.

476
00:31:43,889 --> 00:31:49,320
Rym: Yeah, we should do a show about securities next Especially since I've been doing a lot of security type work lately.

477
00:31:49,461 --> 00:31:53,139
Scott: I took a lot of security classes and I know a lot about writing secure software.

478
00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:53,943
Rym: Yeah I'm talking.

479
00:31:53,964 --> 00:32:00,936
Rym: I know a lot about like institutional security and Audit security and Sarbanes Oxley security and all that horseshit.

480
00:32:01,057 --> 00:32:01,860
Scott: All right, let's do it then.

481
00:32:02,302 --> 00:32:05,658
Rym: All right, because it's too complicated to talk about now That's for sure.

482
00:32:05,901 --> 00:32:06,002
Scott: but

483
00:32:06,022 --> 00:32:20,489
Rym: the best I can say kind of a teaser for our show is that Security is not what you think it is when it comes to IT and people really especially people who are in power in companies really don't understand it and They'll crack down on things that look like security holes that aren't

484
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,974
Scott: because magazines tell them to

485
00:32:22,054 --> 00:32:24,943
Rym: and they'll ignore things that are security holes But don't look like it

486
00:32:25,164 --> 00:32:29,120
Scott: because basically no one in a company wants to spend money on security because they don't get anything.

487
00:32:29,261 --> 00:32:33,060
Scott: They don't get money out of it or a company decides risk aversion.

488
00:32:33,561 --> 00:32:40,603
Rym: Actually a company a lot of times will decide that security is an important thing and they'll pump tons of money into it Basically ineffectively.

489
00:32:40,864 --> 00:32:45,696
Rym: Yeah, or they'll become too secure technologically and then they make their business less efficient.

490
00:32:46,037 --> 00:32:52,114
Rym: either that or worse They'll make their employees less reliable because the employees resent being treated like criminals.

491
00:32:52,715 --> 00:32:56,194
Rym: and then employees will think oh They think they can keep me from getting this data.

492
00:32:56,335 --> 00:32:58,222
Rym: I can get this data Yeah.

493
00:32:58,463 --> 00:33:00,893
Rym: Yeah, so we'll do a whole show on that cool someday.

494
00:33:00,913 --> 00:33:02,480
Scott: They might do more than one show on that.

495
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:03,688
Rym: Yeah, maybe we'll do a series.

496
00:33:04,132 --> 00:33:14,478
Scott: Anyway, next news There's this guy and I don't know a lot about him But apparently he's a funny famous British guy called Ricky Gervais, I think is the correct pronunciation.

497
00:33:15,621 --> 00:33:18,188
Rym: Wow, that was that would have been funny if you'd done it on purpose.

498
00:33:18,569 --> 00:33:20,334
Scott: I mispronounced correct pronunciation.

499
00:33:20,354 --> 00:33:20,515
Scott: Yeah.

500
00:33:20,755 --> 00:33:20,916
Rym: Okay.

501
00:33:21,116 --> 00:33:22,300
Scott: All right, Ricky Gervais.

502
00:33:23,981 --> 00:33:26,797
Scott: Anyway, he has a podcast that was number one in iTunes.

503
00:33:26,877 --> 00:33:27,380
Scott: it for a while.

504
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:31,059
Scott: It's still pretty high up there and I haven't listened to it, but it's supposedly funny.

505
00:33:32,481 --> 00:33:38,380
Scott: I'll take people's word for it because people of all shapes and sizes have been praising it.

506
00:33:39,452 --> 00:33:42,970
Scott: anyway It's been decided that starting next month.

507
00:33:43,512 --> 00:33:45,459
Scott: His podcast is no longer gonna be free.

508
00:33:45,801 --> 00:33:49,230
Scott: He's gonna charge seven dollars a month to listen to his podcast.

509
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:50,112
Rym: That's the end of that.

510
00:33:50,754 --> 00:33:53,483
Scott: Yeah, there he goes down Shitter.

511
00:33:54,749 --> 00:34:00,896
Scott: I don't know anyone who's gonna pay seven dollars a month unless He makes like a one-hour episode seven days a week.

512
00:34:01,258 --> 00:34:03,906
Scott: that's like Ridiculously pee in your pants.

513
00:34:03,946 --> 00:34:04,549
Scott: hilarious.

514
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:04,871
Rym: Now.

515
00:34:05,433 --> 00:34:06,900
Scott: I was not gonna get many buyers.

516
00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:08,913
Rym: I wonder how exactly he would do that.

517
00:34:08,933 --> 00:34:09,960
Rym: You have to buy it through iTunes.

518
00:34:10,121 --> 00:34:14,982
Scott: Yeah in iTunes, you know when you go to get a podcast it just says Subscribe.

519
00:34:15,181 --> 00:34:16,969
Scott: we're in the spot where it normally says.

520
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:18,696
Rym: All right, so it does all this through iTunes.

521
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:19,097
Rym: Yeah.

522
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:19,297
Scott: Yeah.

523
00:34:19,318 --> 00:34:21,085
Rym: Yeah See, I don't really use iTunes.

524
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:24,560
Rym: So so the way I think of a podcast I think of just an RSS feed.

525
00:34:24,822 --> 00:34:33,460
Scott: Yeah, well in iTunes Subscribing to an RSS feed for a podcast that's in the iTunes directory because you can't just cut and paste URL of a feed into iTunes.

526
00:34:34,107 --> 00:34:38,612
Scott: This is subscribe button Which is the same button that you would normally push to buy a song.

527
00:34:38,652 --> 00:34:39,978
Scott: that's that would say buy on it.

528
00:34:40,521 --> 00:34:45,818
Scott: It just in in the price where the place of the money the dollar amount usually says 99 cents.

529
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:46,300
Scott: It's it's free.

530
00:34:47,204 --> 00:34:48,289
Scott: So you see a podcast.

531
00:34:48,309 --> 00:34:52,286
Scott: you just click subscribe and you're subscribed For his.

532
00:34:52,567 --> 00:34:54,380
Scott: apparently what it's gonna say subscribe.

533
00:34:56,882 --> 00:35:02,520
Scott: So you clip subscribe you pay seven dollars through iTunes and then it gets subscribed.

534
00:35:03,322 --> 00:35:10,920
Rym: great Honestly, I'm gonna keep an eye on this but I really think that his podcast is going to completely disappear in short order.

535
00:35:11,282 --> 00:35:14,980
Scott: I think this is gonna be because it is really popular and supposedly really funny.

536
00:35:15,502 --> 00:35:21,885
Scott: I think this is gonna be the first real test of whether people are willing to pay money For audio content.

537
00:35:22,025 --> 00:35:27,199
Rym: if it's good enough, I can tell all of you out there now that GeekNights will always forevermore be free.

538
00:35:28,203 --> 00:35:35,572
Rym: Yep, we might do things to make money someday if we get crazy popular But those things would be like tell it selling t-shirts or whatever.

539
00:35:35,653 --> 00:35:37,700
Rym: We would never selling public appearances.

540
00:35:37,961 --> 00:35:41,120
Rym: Yeah, we would never ever ever make you pay for GeekNights selling our bodies.

541
00:35:42,243 --> 00:35:43,171
Rym: Yeah, at least my body.

542
00:35:43,373 --> 00:35:51,500
Scott: Yeah, whatever We might you know, even if crazy stuff happens and we still want to do this for some reason we'll do whatever.

543
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:54,892
Scott: We'll post it in foreign lands and go to Antarctica.

544
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:55,333
Scott: Who knows?

545
00:35:55,674 --> 00:35:57,380
Rym: Yeah, but GeekNights will always be free.

546
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,713
Rym: You can quote us on that forever because we're basically doing this for fun.

547
00:36:01,155 --> 00:36:05,272
Rym: any money or fame We get as a result of it is purely just awesome.

548
00:36:05,432 --> 00:36:07,119
Scott: You don't really nights is ever not free.

549
00:36:07,762 --> 00:36:11,358
Scott: Come kick me in the nuts and bring this episode of the podcast with you.

550
00:36:12,441 --> 00:36:16,460
Scott: Play me saying it and then kick me in the nuts and then do it again because there's nothing we could say to that?

551
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:19,812
Scott: No, not really that we would be pooned totally pooned.

552
00:36:20,173 --> 00:36:27,400
Rym: Yeah, I like to think that we're fairly incorruptible But I wonder what would happen if an evil man came and said here's five million dollars charge a dollar for your podcast.

553
00:36:28,362 --> 00:36:30,877
Scott: I would use the five million dollars to purchase a cup.

554
00:36:34,823 --> 00:36:35,226
Scott: All right.

555
00:36:35,509 --> 00:36:47,294
Rym: All right, so You know for someone who has a throat infection and it's incredibly painful to talk after been talking a lot Yeah, you're you know, that's why we pushed all my news is to the front.

556
00:36:47,454 --> 00:36:57,110
Rym: and now yeah, so Propaganda has always been around and The United States military makes great use of.

557
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:59,499
Scott: I don't think Hammurabi had propaganda did he?

558
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:02,240
Rym: There was propaganda in the ancient Greeks.

559
00:37:02,766 --> 00:37:04,000
Scott: Alright, that's that's early enough.

560
00:37:04,241 --> 00:37:13,840
Rym: There were a lot of things written about various cities in Greece that are very disparaging and they were mostly written by people in other Greek states, I wonder if some of the hieroglyphs in Egypt are propaganda.

561
00:37:14,702 --> 00:37:18,800
Rym: Well, you realize that there's evidence that the Egyptians had another language that they use for day to day.

562
00:37:19,161 --> 00:37:20,968
Rym: Oh, yeah, hieroglyphs were like an archival language.

563
00:37:21,329 --> 00:37:22,052
Scott: Yeah, but I'm just.

564
00:37:22,112 --> 00:37:24,140
Scott: I'm just wondering if I assume they did.

565
00:37:24,482 --> 00:37:26,413
Rym: I assume there are things like Cleopatra.

566
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:27,137
Rym: does the nasty?

567
00:37:30,543 --> 00:37:32,337
Rym: You've never seen Bubba hotep go see it right now.

568
00:37:33,441 --> 00:37:45,400
Rym: Yeah, pause the podcast go to a blockbuster rent Bubba hotep and watch it or else you won't get the following joke about Suck the dog dick of Anubis asswipe.

569
00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:50,556
Rym: So anyway propaganda, I'm not gonna talk about the history of propaganda, even though I'd like to.

570
00:37:50,576 --> 00:37:51,480
Scott: yeah, that'd be fun.

571
00:37:51,821 --> 00:37:52,926
Rym: Yeah, that'll be a show someday.

572
00:37:52,946 --> 00:37:54,855
Scott: All right, we're really good at you.

573
00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:55,418
Scott: Don't forget them.

574
00:37:55,759 --> 00:38:03,197
Rym: Yeah Yeah, let's see propaganda show because people have complained about how we talk about a show that we'll do and they say oh, that's awesome I can't wait for you to do it and then we never do it.

575
00:38:03,842 --> 00:38:11,394
Scott: yeah, go to the forums and make a list of all the shows you want us to do because We have a lot of hard times usually Monday and Thursday going.

576
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,257
Scott: what are we gonna talk about?

577
00:38:12,357 --> 00:38:19,677
Rym: I don't know All right, but basically Donald Rumsfeld to sum this up really quickly Donald asshole.

578
00:38:20,118 --> 00:38:22,283
Rym: He wants The u.s.

579
00:38:22,323 --> 00:38:24,832
Rym: To make its propaganda machine more efficient and quicker.

580
00:38:25,434 --> 00:38:27,220
Scott: Wait, so he's just like we're making propaganda.

581
00:38:28,004 --> 00:38:29,129
Rym: We need to have it quicker.

582
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:29,993
Scott: Let's do it better.

583
00:38:30,014 --> 00:38:39,722
Rym: quote the u.s Must fight back by operating a more effective 24-hour propaganda machine or risk a dangerous deficiency Uh-huh.

584
00:38:39,803 --> 00:38:47,707
Scott: How about um, just not making any propaganda and letting honesty and truth come out of Media machine.

585
00:38:47,767 --> 00:38:49,112
Rym: this really perplexes me.

586
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:51,420
Rym: So we now have a news item.

587
00:38:51,501 --> 00:38:53,038
Rym: This is in the international news.

588
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:59,100
Rym: Well, the US government admits to propagandizing the Iraqi people and talks about how they need to do it better.

589
00:39:00,141 --> 00:39:06,180
Scott: Now, uh, we're not lying to these people and convincing them and implanting our ideals in them enough.

590
00:39:06,402 --> 00:39:13,619
Rym: well, no, I don't know about you, but I can read the newspaper and some dude in Iraq can also read the newspaper.

591
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:17,531
Rym: and if he reads in the newspaper that the u.s.

592
00:39:17,652 --> 00:39:25,051
Rym: Is trying to propagandize him and Openly admits to doing so and then he turns and he sees u.s.

593
00:39:25,091 --> 00:39:25,773
Rym: Propaganda.

594
00:39:25,793 --> 00:39:28,480
Rym: I don't see it being so effective anymore.

595
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:35,100
Scott: You know you think that but the nature of propaganda these days is very different.

596
00:39:35,521 --> 00:39:36,545
Scott: It's like back in the day.

597
00:39:36,585 --> 00:39:43,635
Scott: propaganda would be like a poster saying, you know Russia bad Well now yeah now they're called like information ops.

598
00:39:43,675 --> 00:39:55,252
Scott: yet now It's like what they'll do is hire a PR guy who goes to a newspaper and talks to a journalist and that journalist writes a story for the newspaper about how you know something.

599
00:39:55,312 --> 00:40:01,779
Scott: something is so great or something something is you know, The new popular trend or a new fad and it to you.

600
00:40:02,041 --> 00:40:05,060
Scott: It looks like a normal news story and it is a normal news story.

601
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:15,473
Scott: It's not an advertisement and it wasn't paid for by anyone but some PR guy Got the journalist to write it and got to write it the way they wanted to.

602
00:40:15,573 --> 00:40:17,740
Scott: and that's how propaganda works these days.

603
00:40:17,881 --> 00:40:18,926
Scott: You can't tell.

604
00:40:18,987 --> 00:40:21,440
Scott: it's not obvious like the stuff in your social studies book.

605
00:40:21,934 --> 00:40:24,090
Rym: I mean I'm not talking about this issue because of.

606
00:40:24,191 --> 00:40:30,000
Rym: I want to talk about what's going on in Iraq Because we talked enough about our political views randomly anyway.

607
00:40:30,601 --> 00:40:31,891
Scott: Nobody in the world agrees.

608
00:40:31,911 --> 00:40:35,627
Scott: Yeah Because we just piss everyone off.

609
00:40:36,049 --> 00:40:36,270
Rym: Yeah.

610
00:40:36,531 --> 00:40:39,782
Rym: Yeah, but not to talk about Iraq but just talk about propaganda.

611
00:40:40,323 --> 00:40:43,007
Rym: and technology has really changed the way propaganda works.

612
00:40:43,528 --> 00:40:53,330
Rym: and Scott just mentioned the Media campaigns that people will do for various reasons and I will note that there is probably one going on right now That I have just picked up on.

613
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,859
Rym: so see if you can see this in the media.

614
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:00,847
Rym: curling Not curling your hair Curling the Canadian sport.

615
00:41:01,249 --> 00:41:01,831
Scott: It's Canadian.

616
00:41:02,514 --> 00:41:07,700
Scott: It's not Canadian, but where I grew up I've always known it is like a thing people only care about when it's in the Olympics.

617
00:41:08,221 --> 00:41:13,658
Rym: Oh, no where I grew up curling was fairly well known really and in Canada curling is very popular.

618
00:41:13,678 --> 00:41:14,280
Rym: Okay?

619
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:20,760
Scott: I had one friend's dad in high school and his dad curled and he has curling stone in the basement.

620
00:41:21,443 --> 00:41:22,569
Rym: I've tried it a couple times.

621
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:23,655
Scott: I never actually tried it.

622
00:41:23,735 --> 00:41:24,338
Scott: It's kind of fun.

623
00:41:24,479 --> 00:41:25,987
Scott: Yeah Well, I figure it's a lot like bowling.

624
00:41:26,007 --> 00:41:30,565
Scott: you just throw this rock down the ice and a bunch of guys do the broom You bit and you know, that's it.

625
00:41:31,146 --> 00:41:32,590
Rym: It's kind of like high-stakes.

626
00:41:32,771 --> 00:41:33,573
Rym: Awesome bocce.

627
00:41:34,114 --> 00:41:34,896
Scott: Oh bocce is cool.

628
00:41:35,097 --> 00:41:35,638
Rym: I love bocce.

629
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:39,579
Rym: Yeah Alright, I've just noticed cuz we don't watch TV at all.

630
00:41:39,901 --> 00:41:43,480
Rym: But I was in the laundromat today and I caught on the news.

631
00:41:44,082 --> 00:41:48,379
Rym: they were showing like the results of curling and then they talked about how Bush went to watch curling.

632
00:41:48,399 --> 00:41:57,480
Rym: and Then Later, I caught a commercial for another news bit where they were gonna talk about the rise of popularity and curling in the u.s.

633
00:41:57,701 --> 00:42:02,564
Rym: And like why it's becoming more popular and now they think it's gonna be popular in the south Like it's gonna move down.

634
00:42:02,885 --> 00:42:03,607
Scott: You know what that is.

635
00:42:04,008 --> 00:42:06,135
Scott: See curling isn't actually popular.

636
00:42:06,255 --> 00:42:07,740
Scott: No one gave a shit about curling.

637
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:16,840
Scott: They're making these news stories Saying people give a shit about curling and as a result of these stories people will begin to give a shit about curling.

638
00:42:17,223 --> 00:42:21,772
Scott: It's a self-fulfilling Prophecy a self-fulfilling not to disparage curling.

639
00:42:21,832 --> 00:42:22,676
Rym: I think it's a cool sport.

640
00:42:22,716 --> 00:42:24,718
Scott: Yeah, curling is not so bad It's a lot worse things.

641
00:42:24,921 --> 00:42:28,320
Rym: They're trying to make it popular for some reason and I'll bet that reason involves money.

642
00:42:28,601 --> 00:42:35,239
Scott: I bet that in reason involves the curling Association of whatever who knows paying PR guys to make this happen.

643
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:40,079
Rym: Because you could see I mean just kind of keep an eye out in the news and see if I'm right about this.

644
00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:44,137
Rym: just pay Attention watch for people talking about how popular curling is nowadays.

645
00:42:44,157 --> 00:42:47,533
Rym: Mm-hmm The same thing happened with Sudoku a while ago.

646
00:42:47,693 --> 00:42:49,120
Scott: Yeah, did you Sudoku?

647
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:54,060
Scott: Did you see a bunch of people playing Sudoku before you saw it on the news or after?

648
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,887
Rym: Yeah, there were news articles all over the place.

649
00:42:56,967 --> 00:43:00,660
Rym: suddenly like a blitz Sudoku is becoming crazy popular in the u.s.

650
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:08,255
Rym: All the smart people have been playing Sudoku in the u.s And then people started playing Sudoku and you started seeing it in supermarket.

651
00:43:08,296 --> 00:43:09,620
Scott: news started seeing it all over the place.

652
00:43:10,162 --> 00:43:13,174
Scott: It comes, you know, this isn't a chicken egg mystery.

653
00:43:13,455 --> 00:43:14,840
Scott: We know which one comes first.

654
00:43:15,042 --> 00:43:17,280
Scott: It's obvious to anyone with eyeballs.

655
00:43:18,102 --> 00:43:20,720
Scott: People were not playing Sudoku like crazy nuts.

656
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:25,293
Scott: It's a very old silly puzzle that a computer can figure it out in two seconds.

657
00:43:25,434 --> 00:43:27,540
Scott: You know, it's a simple brain task.

658
00:43:28,284 --> 00:43:29,350
Scott: Just anyone can do it.

659
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:31,100
Scott: It doesn't take a genius, you know.

660
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,333
Scott: It just makes dumb people feel smart when they fill it.

661
00:43:33,373 --> 00:43:34,238
Scott: figure it out because it.

662
00:43:34,399 --> 00:43:36,420
Scott: you know It's just a matter of time not a matter.

663
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:41,700
Scott: But anyway, the point is that they said it was popular and therefore it became popular.

664
00:43:42,242 --> 00:43:46,000
Scott: The same thing with the Tickle Me Elmo things and the Furbies and the Tamagotchis.

665
00:43:46,342 --> 00:43:47,994
Rym: They hype them up like they're gonna sell out of the note.

666
00:43:48,135 --> 00:43:48,659
Rym: They sell out.

667
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:52,392
Scott: Yeah, if they didn't say anything about the Tickle Me Elmo's on the news.

668
00:43:52,873 --> 00:43:54,057
Scott: No one would freaking want one.

669
00:43:54,097 --> 00:43:54,920
Scott: It's a stupid toy.

670
00:43:55,701 --> 00:43:56,805
Scott: Same with the Tamagotchis.

671
00:43:56,825 --> 00:43:57,990
Scott: Those things are like a waste of time.

672
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:58,572
Scott: They're boring.

673
00:43:58,592 --> 00:44:00,258
Scott: Yeah, not like the Pokemon.

674
00:44:00,299 --> 00:44:04,107
Scott: Those are Ten dogs you get the drift.

675
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:09,999
Rym: Yeah, but anyway, we'll do a whole show on this and I actually wrote it down So I won't forget because I took a lot of classes on this.

676
00:44:10,341 --> 00:44:23,949
Rym: Yeah, I mean I went to school for IT, but I kind of scanned my way around getting into classes I really shouldn't have been able to take and I ended up taking the entire professional technical communications major Which includes a lot of like persuasion propaganda type stuff.

677
00:44:24,551 --> 00:44:26,959
Rym: I could talk about this for hours, especially if my throat didn't hurt.

678
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:28,400
Scott: Yeah alright.

679
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:32,903
Rym: so Windows Vista Great again.

680
00:44:32,923 --> 00:44:34,888
Rym: Yeah, it's just the worst thing in the world.

681
00:44:35,209 --> 00:44:41,749
Rym: So Yahoo News has what looks like an op-ed about Ten reasons why you should buy Windows Vista.

682
00:44:41,969 --> 00:44:44,960
Scott: Wait, wait, there's one reason we should buy Windows Vista.

683
00:44:45,201 --> 00:44:49,840
Rym: Well, alright, so this guy claims to have ten reasons why we're buying Windows Vista is going to be alright.

684
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:50,939
Scott: Let's play a game ready.

685
00:44:51,542 --> 00:44:54,051
Scott: You say the reason and then I'll shoot it down.

686
00:44:54,092 --> 00:44:57,766
Scott: and if I fail every time I fail to shoot down a reason I'll give you a dollar.

687
00:44:57,988 --> 00:44:58,471
Rym: or how about this?

688
00:44:58,511 --> 00:45:02,588
Rym: for every reason you fail to shoot it down We'll each buy one copy of Windows Vista.

689
00:45:02,889 --> 00:45:04,334
Rym: Alright, cuz I've already read through these.

690
00:45:04,574 --> 00:45:05,417
Scott: Alright, let's go for it.

691
00:45:05,437 --> 00:45:09,870
Rym: Alright, so one Security Windows Vista is gonna be really secure.

692
00:45:10,131 --> 00:45:12,319
Rym: It's gonna come with a firewall and such.

693
00:45:13,742 --> 00:45:15,890
Scott: So wait, so it's already so insecure.

694
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:17,054
Scott: It's running all these services.

695
00:45:17,134 --> 00:45:18,479
Scott: It needs a firewall and to.

696
00:45:19,621 --> 00:45:21,048
Scott: Let's see how long it takes to hack it.

697
00:45:21,068 --> 00:45:21,711
Scott: Let's see one day.

698
00:45:21,811 --> 00:45:23,740
Rym: Well, the same claim was made about Windows XP.

699
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:25,369
Scott: Yeah, Oh Windows 2000.

700
00:45:25,369 --> 00:45:26,818
Scott: I was like security problems.

701
00:45:26,858 --> 00:45:28,505
Scott: here comes It was really well.

702
00:45:28,545 --> 00:45:32,700
Rym: while your problem they released like eight patches recently like in the last couple of weeks.

703
00:45:33,622 --> 00:45:44,480
Rym: They talk about how there's the Windows services hardening which is this buzzword thing where it prevents quote obscure background processes from being hijacked and changing your system.

704
00:45:45,464 --> 00:45:49,439
Scott: All right, we're gonna start a betting pool to see how long it takes those spyware guys.

705
00:45:49,981 --> 00:45:57,210
Rym: They've also got full disk encryption, which you might think is cool But I see it as one performance hit and two.

706
00:45:57,591 --> 00:46:00,400
Rym: if your Windows installation breaks your data is gone forever.

707
00:46:00,922 --> 00:46:01,745
Scott: Yeah, great.

708
00:46:02,006 --> 00:46:05,137
Scott: there's also another problem of full disk encryption is that you're not gonna be.

709
00:46:05,257 --> 00:46:05,980
Scott: you know your Linux.

710
00:46:06,081 --> 00:46:09,888
Scott: you're not gonna be able to mount your Vista file systems or anything.

711
00:46:09,908 --> 00:46:10,972
Scott: How are you gonna recover them?

712
00:46:11,093 --> 00:46:12,538
Scott: There's just no recovery whatsoever.

713
00:46:12,558 --> 00:46:13,902
Scott: You're screwed All right.

714
00:46:13,943 --> 00:46:18,396
Rym: Now this one shoots itself down to Internet Explorer 7 now.

715
00:46:18,456 --> 00:46:25,127
Rym: Here's the quote ie Gets a much-needed Firefox inspired makeover,

716
00:46:25,473 --> 00:46:37,680
Scott: okay while this could have something to it because ie is a little more Optimized performance wise and memory usage wise than Firefox is on the Windows platform

717
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:42,697
Rym: That's mostly because ie is also the Explorer in Windows and it's running all the time.

718
00:46:42,797 --> 00:46:52,772
Scott: Anyway, yeah And it all that causes actually a problem and that it's most of the security holes in Windows are because ie is so tied Into the OS that through the web browser.

719
00:46:52,792 --> 00:46:54,440
Scott: You can attack the operating system itself.

720
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,909
Rym: Anyway, so that's what they claim to a fix with ie7.

721
00:46:56,949 --> 00:47:04,200
Rym: They well that it runs in a reduced privilege mode So that it can't access other code and it's basically in a sandbox.

722
00:47:04,341 --> 00:47:16,180
Scott: well, that's good, but on the other hand a lot of people have been using the ie7 beta and From all every single review I've read has said it's much better than ie6, but it's still no Firefox.

723
00:47:16,622 --> 00:47:19,336
Scott: They know how to copy Firefox and they didn't quite do it all the way.

724
00:47:19,396 --> 00:47:20,060
Rym: No, here's the thing.

725
00:47:20,401 --> 00:47:21,946
Rym: There are two versions of ie7.

726
00:47:22,407 --> 00:47:24,614
Rym: You only get the real version if you're running Vista.

727
00:47:24,774 --> 00:47:28,319
Rym: No one has used the real version yet requires Vista.

728
00:47:29,361 --> 00:47:39,540
Scott: Well, if the non-real version of ie7 is not quite Firefox I can't Down the point here not the fact that it sucks in general.

729
00:47:39,761 --> 00:47:43,819
Rym: Yeah, their point is that ie7 is better because now it runs into the secure protected mode.

730
00:47:45,482 --> 00:47:54,134
Rym: In Linux and I mean Windows you're fucked anyway, but at least in Linux Firefox Already runs in a limited mode because you're not root so it can't do crap.

731
00:47:54,174 --> 00:47:55,820
Scott: You could run Firefox as a root.

732
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:56,265
Scott: You can't.

733
00:47:56,285 --> 00:47:59,407
Scott: even then You know, it can't really.

734
00:47:59,588 --> 00:48:01,800
Scott: it's still not very limited.

735
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:06,139
Rym: Well for anyone who hasn't used Linux in Windows you pretty much have to be administrator or you can't do anything.

736
00:48:06,601 --> 00:48:10,620
Rym: Hmm in Linux, you never need to be your root almost ever.

737
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:16,542
Scott: Yeah, pretty much only if you're configuring the computer installing software or something All right.

738
00:48:16,582 --> 00:48:18,409
Rym: number three because I want to get through these.

739
00:48:18,449 --> 00:48:19,051
Rym: there's a lot of them.

740
00:48:19,212 --> 00:48:21,380
Rym: All right righteous eye candy.

741
00:48:23,036 --> 00:48:31,885
Scott: Um Actually all the XGL type stuff is coming out for links actually starting to work out all the fancy 3d stuff or you know It was like all weekend.

742
00:48:32,006 --> 00:48:34,434
Scott: and yeah OS X is look good for years.

743
00:48:34,534 --> 00:48:36,180
Rym: Yeah OS X is fantastic and beautiful.

744
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:42,859
Scott: So basically they're openly admitting that Windows is ugly and that finally it's gonna look better plus they're not doing it very elegantly.

745
00:48:43,341 --> 00:48:44,144
Rym: Final quote here.

746
00:48:44,485 --> 00:48:48,639
Rym: You need powerful graphics hardware and a robust system to manage all of these effects.

747
00:48:49,282 --> 00:48:53,840
Scott: Wait, so it's actually a reason not to buy Vista because it doesn't work on shitty computers.

748
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,712
Scott: It only works on amazing computers that don't exist yet.

749
00:48:56,732 --> 00:48:58,198
Rym: All right, I'm gonna do the rest of these.

750
00:48:58,218 --> 00:49:00,314
Rym: real quick desktop search.

751
00:49:01,802 --> 00:49:02,485
Rym: Already have that?

752
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:05,640
Rym: even though I don't use Google I can already do ctrl F and search for anything.

753
00:49:05,821 --> 00:49:08,771
Rym: Yep, all they're doing is making it faster.

754
00:49:08,851 --> 00:49:10,658
Scott: They're making it Google desktop styling.

755
00:49:10,818 --> 00:49:12,919
Scott: I think better updates.

756
00:49:13,941 --> 00:49:20,120
Scott: Yeah, I heard that instead of using a web page in IE to update the OS there's gonna be a separate updating program.

757
00:49:20,481 --> 00:49:28,898
Rym: Yeah, a separate updating program that won't let you update a pirated copy of Windows, which I know most people I know have sucks more media.

758
00:49:30,781 --> 00:49:32,548
Scott: But the windows media programs suck.

759
00:49:32,588 --> 00:49:33,672
Scott: you always use some.

760
00:49:33,712 --> 00:49:35,077
Scott: you replace every single one of those.

761
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:35,840
Scott: that's the first thing you do.

762
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,234
Rym: Any media you want online is gonna be free.

763
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:42,396
Scott: Anyway, actually, I heard that when amps dead people are all using something else.

764
00:49:42,436 --> 00:49:45,910
Rym: WinAmp is dead Yeah, I've had a security hole in it recently too sucks.

765
00:49:46,392 --> 00:49:48,420
Scott: But yeah, everyone's using VLC and whatnot.

766
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,631
Scott: No one uses freaking the windows media player crap.

767
00:49:50,671 --> 00:49:54,389
Rym: I think they're talking mostly about the Proprietary protected content.

768
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:55,960
Rym: that'll only be able to be watched on this.

769
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:57,466
Scott: That's the stuff that you don't want.

770
00:49:57,526 --> 00:49:58,711
Scott: is the DRM plus.

771
00:49:58,731 --> 00:50:00,298
Rym: someone will crack it and you'll be out there for free.

772
00:50:00,499 --> 00:50:03,529
Rym: Yep Alright, um parental controls.

773
00:50:03,971 --> 00:50:04,755
Scott: That's a good thing.

774
00:50:05,096 --> 00:50:05,820
Scott: Not that I know of.

775
00:50:06,283 --> 00:50:08,017
Rym: Yeah, what do they mean by parental controls?

776
00:50:08,118 --> 00:50:13,640
Rym: I mean If you want to control your kids access you give them their own account and you just restrict it.

777
00:50:14,461 --> 00:50:20,363
Rym: If you really don't want to get access you set up some sort of net filter like net nanny or whatever if you're that much Of a horrible parent.

778
00:50:21,146 --> 00:50:25,824
Scott: Yeah, you can't freaking pay attention to what your kids are doing and make sure you know They know what they're looking at.

779
00:50:26,085 --> 00:50:36,320
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I'm not gonna get off on a rant here to you know to quote comedian but anyway My parents Dimly understood what was going on in the internet and they just gave me free rein.

780
00:50:36,741 --> 00:50:41,416
Rym: I had a full-on completely unlimited internet connection for much of my life and I turned out.

781
00:50:41,476 --> 00:50:41,797
Rym: Okay.

782
00:50:42,399 --> 00:50:50,608
Scott: Yeah I played whatever video game I want and internet did pretty much whatever I wanted and my parents would sometimes be like, alright Yeah, you probably shouldn't watch that.

783
00:50:50,688 --> 00:50:53,280
Scott: or yeah, don't go looking at porn or whatever.

784
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:59,300
Rym: But basically they're all these features that like here you can even block access to games based on the ESRB ratings.

785
00:51:00,761 --> 00:51:06,796
Scott: It's not really useful Alright, most PC games worth playing nowadays are highly rated.

786
00:51:07,217 --> 00:51:07,920
Rym: better backups.

787
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,412
Rym: They claim they made that system restore better not suck.

788
00:51:11,116 --> 00:51:12,000
Scott: All right, that's good.

789
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,005
Scott: However, are they gonna be encrypted?

790
00:51:14,025 --> 00:51:16,291
Scott: because if they aren't then that kind of do.

791
00:51:16,331 --> 00:51:18,697
Rym: more importantly that never really works.

792
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:22,099
Scott: I Think what that's what they're saying is that the new one is gonna work.

793
00:51:22,331 --> 00:51:27,265
Scott: Yeah We'll see if it actually does because backups really don't make sense anymore now that we have these gigantic Hard drives.

794
00:51:27,305 --> 00:51:28,998
Scott: you really need a hard drive to back it up.

795
00:51:29,601 --> 00:51:34,013
Scott: So there really needs to new be a new backup paradigm to.

796
00:51:34,254 --> 00:51:36,580
Rym: well, you know what my backup paradigm is raid.

797
00:51:37,581 --> 00:51:38,063
Scott: Yeah, you don't.

798
00:51:38,104 --> 00:51:41,820
Scott: mine is my important files go on a DVD and there aren't many of them.

799
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,237
Rym: Well, I guess we could do a whole show on backing up if we wanted to.

800
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:46,985
Scott: Oh God Today's thing.

801
00:51:47,086 --> 00:51:49,263
Scott: I could do a whole show on Asterisk.

802
00:51:49,304 --> 00:51:49,484
Rym: Yeah.

803
00:51:49,665 --> 00:51:51,534
Rym: Well backing up includes two different things.

804
00:51:52,117 --> 00:51:59,000
Rym: one is Backing up data so that if there's a hardware or major software failure, the data is still intact.

805
00:52:00,161 --> 00:52:09,782
Rym: the other important part is taking snapshots of a system so that if a change is made and you have to undo that change you'll Be able to undo it by reverting Mm-hmm.

806
00:52:09,943 --> 00:52:12,996
Rym: Those are two separate issues that are backed up in separate ways.

807
00:52:13,458 --> 00:52:16,047
Rym: raid covers The first one only tapes cover.

808
00:52:16,067 --> 00:52:16,629
Rym: the second one.

809
00:52:16,729 --> 00:52:18,716
Rym: only having both is expensive.

810
00:52:18,976 --> 00:52:20,744
Rym: You have to make a choice Mm-hmm.

811
00:52:21,467 --> 00:52:22,633
Rym: Yeah, we'll do a whole show on that too.

812
00:52:22,653 --> 00:52:23,759
Rym: Let me note that here.

813
00:52:24,242 --> 00:52:26,179
Scott: Well, you can use tapes for the first one, but it sucks.

814
00:52:26,723 --> 00:52:29,739
Rym: Yeah, it's not very efficient and tapes are actually very expensive.

815
00:52:29,859 --> 00:52:33,879
Scott: now They are especially those machines that move the tapes around but those are fun to watch where they go.

816
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,731
Scott: Okay All right, is that all his reasons?

817
00:52:38,114 --> 00:52:38,940
Rym: peer-to-peer collaboration?

818
00:52:39,841 --> 00:52:45,900
Rym: It claims that the windows collaboration module uses peer-to-peer technology to let Vista users work together in a shared workspace.

819
00:52:46,543 --> 00:52:51,903
Rym: now basically, this is probably the only one that has any sort of Usefulness to it at all.

820
00:52:52,284 --> 00:52:57,300
Rym: Basically, they're saying that it looks like Windows Vista is going to come with VPN ad hoc workgroup networking.

821
00:52:58,541 --> 00:52:59,004
Scott: You know what?

822
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:02,500
Scott: There are a million third-party things that have been doing this for years Hamachi.

823
00:53:03,001 --> 00:53:05,790
Scott: Yeah, there are also websites that do this sort of thing.

824
00:53:05,830 --> 00:53:08,760
Scott: You can just all visit the website and then you'll be collaborating.

825
00:53:09,225 --> 00:53:12,185
Rym: Yep, I mean, I'm not saying that It's a bad thing.

826
00:53:12,486 --> 00:53:13,390
Rym: things like this are cool.

827
00:53:13,791 --> 00:53:15,880
Rym: But why does the operating system need to do that?

828
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,477
Scott: Yeah, that should be like some piece of software that does that?

829
00:53:19,598 --> 00:53:19,899
Scott: I don't know.

830
00:53:20,761 --> 00:53:22,187
Rym: Alright, the last one is quick setup.

831
00:53:22,729 --> 00:53:25,700
Rym: They say that it takes about 15 minutes to install Vista.

832
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:27,728
Scott: It takes five minutes to install Ubuntu shut up.

833
00:53:28,089 --> 00:53:31,020
Rym: Yeah, not picks it take you hit enter or no.

834
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,367
Rym: You type install and hit enter.

835
00:53:32,729 --> 00:53:33,694
Scott: you don't even have to type in.

836
00:53:33,855 --> 00:53:34,820
Scott: Oh if you want to install it?

837
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:38,201
Rym: Yeah, if you want to install it true Okay.

838
00:53:38,502 --> 00:53:39,546
Rym: Yeah, I'm done with that.

839
00:53:39,626 --> 00:53:40,992
Rym: Windows Vista is a terrible thing.

840
00:53:41,172 --> 00:53:42,397
Scott: OS X it comes installed.

841
00:53:42,798 --> 00:53:45,986
Scott: Yeah All right.

842
00:53:47,503 --> 00:53:53,037
Scott: The last thing I've got here is this thing called feed tree Which I haven't actually used so I can't give a full review of it.

843
00:53:54,044 --> 00:53:58,926
Scott: but supposedly what feed tree is is Bit torrent for feeds.

844
00:53:59,588 --> 00:54:02,579
Scott: right now the way it works is a lot of people who are web.

845
00:54:03,182 --> 00:54:06,452
Scott: You know server guys like me know this problem.

846
00:54:06,593 --> 00:54:08,379
Scott: You have an art RSS feed.

847
00:54:09,224 --> 00:54:10,859
Scott: people subscribe to the RSS feed.

848
00:54:11,802 --> 00:54:17,711
Scott: The RSS readers check these feeds like Every five minutes to see if you posted something new.

849
00:54:18,153 --> 00:54:25,580
Scott: if you have a blog where you update once a week This can eat up a whole lot of bandwidth and you serving a whole bunch of requests that are basically useless.

850
00:54:25,901 --> 00:54:34,420
Rym: Well, I mean for our look at our site feed burner gets hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hits Just constantly, but they know that we're only updating once a day around midnight.

851
00:54:35,003 --> 00:54:37,514
Scott: So, you know, why do we have all these extra things?

852
00:54:37,594 --> 00:54:41,931
Scott: is the only way we can make it work Right now is a polling system as opposed to an interrupt system.

853
00:54:42,192 --> 00:54:43,758
Scott: computer science bla bla bla bla bla bla.

854
00:54:43,798 --> 00:54:48,580
Rym: Yeah I mean luckily all the good like feed aggregators or podcast directories.

855
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:52,640
Rym: The directory will only ping us once a day or will ping it and then it'll update.

856
00:54:52,761 --> 00:54:55,920
Scott: Yeah, the pinging us pinging the directories is a very good system.

857
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,937
Scott: Yeah, the problem there are people still subscribing to the feeds in those directories, you know asking them.

858
00:55:01,037 --> 00:55:01,579
Scott: Is there a new episode?

859
00:55:01,659 --> 00:55:01,920
Scott: is there?

860
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:13,676
Scott: So feed tree attempts to solve this problem by using the bit torrent solution Which is where the people themselves ask each other if the feed has been updated.

861
00:55:14,037 --> 00:55:16,660
Scott: and they don't really ask each other They also kind of tell each other.

862
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:30,220
Scott: so if a bunch of people use feed tree to subscribe to say the GeekNights feed and There's an update to the GeekNights feed then somehow behind the scenes instead of everyone constantly asking GeekNights Is there a new episode or is there an episode?

863
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:40,284
Scott: One guy finds out about a new episode and then he just tells all his friends who tell all their friends tell their friends And anyone else who is using feed tree and is also Subscribed to GeekNights.

864
00:55:40,325 --> 00:55:43,680
Scott: We'll find out from other people using feed tree subscribe to GeekNights.

865
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,668
Rym: I think it's a neat idea one.

866
00:55:44,809 --> 00:55:45,131
Rym: It has.

867
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:46,260
Rym: they have to make sure it's secure.

868
00:55:46,521 --> 00:55:49,678
Rym: I mean I can think of a million ways to all use that for evil.

869
00:55:49,799 --> 00:55:52,380
Scott: Yeah Oh, look, I see who's subscribing to these feeds.

870
00:55:52,561 --> 00:55:57,380
Scott: Oh, look, I tell someone that there's a new item in that feed, but then I point them to my malicious site.

871
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:03,283
Scott: I point them to my site where there's something that looks like an mp3, but it's actually a Trojan, you know All kinds of horrible things.

872
00:56:03,444 --> 00:56:08,240
Rym: Yeah, the other thing is it's encryption solves that but it solves a problem that doesn't exist yet.

873
00:56:08,742 --> 00:56:12,720
Rym: The bad RSS is used by a tiny fraction of the number of people out there.

874
00:56:13,322 --> 00:56:18,540
Scott: It is but it's also a very high percentage of bandwidth on sites that do have it.

875
00:56:18,801 --> 00:56:19,082
Scott: It is.

876
00:56:19,383 --> 00:56:23,120
Rym: if you look at a site like yes, I'm saying that I'm glad I'm not saying this is a bad thing.

877
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:39,860
Rym: I'm saying I'm glad this appeared now before the bandwidth became a real problem like a pressing issue Because now by the time people really have problems with RSS bandwidth usage This thing will already if it's as good as it claims to be be in place or be ready to be accepted.

878
00:56:40,162 --> 00:56:42,840
Scott: These people do really have problems with our this bandwidth usage.

879
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:45,749
Scott: It's not that the bandwidth usage of RSS is so much.

880
00:56:45,789 --> 00:56:46,692
Scott: They can't handle it.

881
00:56:46,793 --> 00:56:48,277
Scott: No, that's the mp3 downloading.

882
00:56:48,297 --> 00:56:49,040
Scott: They can't handle it.

883
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:49,168
Rym: Yeah

884
00:56:49,641 --> 00:57:05,852
Scott: the problem with the RSS is that the percentage of bandwidth the RSS requests are taking up are is Disproportionate to the file size and how often it actually should be requested as opposed to other things Like if you look at like just look at my blog, it's a crummy little blog.

885
00:57:05,893 --> 00:57:08,060
Scott: Maybe a hundred people subscribe to it.

886
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:08,723
Scott: I don't even know.

887
00:57:08,763 --> 00:57:09,266
Scott: I don't care.

888
00:57:09,286 --> 00:57:18,160
Scott: I don't pay attention to that so much and The RSS feed is by by far the most bandwidth and most requested thing.

889
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:22,199
Scott: There is because if one guy subscribes to it, that means he's gonna check it a hundred times a day.

890
00:57:22,982 --> 00:57:28,720
Scott: You know lately I've actually been posting something to it once a day because Rym wasn't here and I had son nothing better to do.

891
00:57:28,802 --> 00:57:31,980
Scott: but Usually I post once every few weeks.

892
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:48,759
Scott: these are people constantly downloading this one file from my website for and get nothing out of it and As opposed to like actual blog entries even ones they get crazy popular, which I've had a couple of those in my time It's nothing compared to what the feed gets, you know, it's just out of control.

893
00:57:49,222 --> 00:57:50,648
Rym: Yeah, so hopefully this will pan out.

894
00:57:50,668 --> 00:57:52,979
Rym: we'll probably report on it again once we know more about it.

895
00:57:53,342 --> 00:57:54,715
Scott: I think I'm gonna try it out tomorrow.

896
00:57:54,917 --> 00:57:58,118
Scott: Yeah I'll tell you what it what it's like if it's any if it's worth it.

897
00:57:58,705 --> 00:57:59,899
Rym: So that's all we've got for today.

898
00:58:00,382 --> 00:58:05,160
Rym: At least we've come up with a bunch of ideas for shows to do on Mondays since Mondays are always the days where?

899
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:06,704
Rym: It's easy to find news.

900
00:58:07,145 --> 00:58:11,560
Rym: It's hard to find good sci-tech stories to talk about where we could actually provide insightful commentary.

901
00:58:11,841 --> 00:58:13,309
Scott: Yeah, Oh another thing is.

902
00:58:13,329 --> 00:58:16,324
Scott: I'm thinking about having themed weeks Like.

903
00:58:16,445 --> 00:58:18,396
Scott: the one idea I came up with is a robot week.

904
00:58:18,417 --> 00:58:27,831
Scott: we're on Monday We can talk about robots and then on Tuesday, we could talk about robot games and on Wednesday We could talk about robot anime and Thursday.

905
00:58:27,871 --> 00:58:29,275
Scott: We can talk about robot something else.

906
00:58:29,296 --> 00:58:30,580
Rym: So you guys think this is a good idea.

907
00:58:30,901 --> 00:58:31,684
Rym: We'll go with it.

908
00:58:31,825 --> 00:58:41,909
Scott: Yeah, if you can think of anything else, that would be a good Themed week, you know something where we can talk about it and a science tech perspective and then it.

909
00:58:42,391 --> 00:58:50,140
Scott: you know video games containing it and then Anime and manga and comics containing it and then something else.

Scott: Then you know, I need more ideas like that.
