00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,574
Rym: It's Wednesday January 11th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,634 --> 00:00:16,869
Rym: We review two pretty terrible anime Gundam F91 and Akagi.

3
00:00:19,523 --> 00:00:20,253
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:21,712 --> 00:00:27,897
Scott: so My job sort of is gonna transfer me from the city to somewhere in the middle of nowhere.

5
00:00:28,298 --> 00:00:34,538
Rym: wow so Well one you're gonna pay me equal rent now cuz I've been kind of subsidizing you or taking that train in whatever.

6
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:42,069
Scott: but Part of the deal is I get a big raise to buy a car that can get me You know one hour each way every day.

7
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,619
Rym: You know you could just take the big raise and not buy the new car.

8
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:54,088
Scott: yeah, except my car will die within like a month if I do that because it's a piece of crap and My it'll suck driving real bad.

9
00:00:54,128 --> 00:00:57,160
Scott: if I had a new car at least it wouldn't be so bad driving every day.

10
00:00:57,522 --> 00:00:59,318
Scott: Oh, yeah, and I need a new car.

11
00:00:59,358 --> 00:00:59,540
Scott: anyway.

12
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,178
Scott: I was gonna buy one in like a couple years, but buying one now doesn't hurt, and it's it's.

13
00:01:04,358 --> 00:01:14,662
Scott: it's Technically free because you know I'll get a raise You know equal to or greater than my monthly increased cost of living, so it'll be like whoop Plus.

14
00:01:14,702 --> 00:01:15,406
Scott: you got to remember.

15
00:01:15,426 --> 00:01:17,980
Scott: I'm not gonna be paying $300 a month for a train ticket.

16
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:27,574
Scott: So you know the monthly payments less than 300 a month, and then my insurance is less than my raise And I'll basically profiting still and getting a car.

17
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:28,459
Scott: so not bad.

18
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:29,363
Rym: Yeah, we'll see.

19
00:01:29,383 --> 00:01:31,110
Rym: we'll see what your financing ends up being.

20
00:01:31,632 --> 00:01:38,958
Scott: if I get financing who knows I might lease I might go get a loan from the bank, and then just buy it with the cash from the bank loan who knows?

21
00:01:39,339 --> 00:01:40,369
Rym: yeah I don't know if I'd lease.

22
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:44,633
Scott: It's generally a bad idea You know, but it's generally a bad idea if you're.

23
00:01:44,934 --> 00:01:52,645
Scott: you know plan is for long term But you know just to get a car, and then you're you want to get rid of it in two years You know it could be alright.

24
00:01:52,665 --> 00:01:54,551
Scott: Oh, yeah, yeah plus.

25
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:55,936
Scott: You know a lot of people.

26
00:01:55,996 --> 00:02:03,339
Scott: I know like my boss he's a lot loads of money and He just constantly leases cars, which I guess is okay.

27
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:15,156
Scott: It's like give this eternal monthly payment, and you never own a car But you always have a newish you always have a like a new car like one or two years old You never have an old jalopy, and that's kind of attractive and kind of worth.

28
00:02:15,216 --> 00:02:17,326
Rym: You know yeah It's kind of attractive, but to me.

29
00:02:17,507 --> 00:02:19,760
Rym: I kind of like the fact that my car isn't new.

30
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:26,179
Rym: I mean my car's not the greatest car, but it's pretty good, and it's nice to not care about it at all.

31
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:27,243
Rym: Yeah That's true.

32
00:02:27,283 --> 00:02:33,571
Rym: like it like I cuz you put a nice little ding in my car from your door And I got no issues with that.

33
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:35,660
Rym: people bump into it and scratch it.

34
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,020
Rym: There's little paint chips on it every now and then cuz people just stupid and parking lots.

35
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,867
Scott: I don't care about that kind of stuff either.

36
00:02:41,048 --> 00:02:44,100
Rym: really yeah, you might care if you got a brand new car though.

37
00:02:44,562 --> 00:02:46,511
Scott: Well, you know not like the paint.

38
00:02:46,692 --> 00:02:50,334
Scott: I would care if there was like a dent in it You know, but if you like scratched it.

39
00:02:50,414 --> 00:02:51,260
Scott: I'd be like whatever.

40
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,020
Scott: Okay, I don't even notice scratches on cars.

41
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,524
Scott: Yeah Let alone get you know.

42
00:02:56,046 --> 00:02:59,640
Scott: plus I would probably pay the 20 bucks to get those little strips on the side.

43
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:02,251
Scott: So if you bump something into the car it'll bump into the strip.

44
00:03:02,271 --> 00:03:02,874
Scott: You know those things.

45
00:03:03,175 --> 00:03:03,938
Rym: yeah, I know those things.

46
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,236
Scott: yeah Plus, I think those actually look better than not you know.

47
00:03:07,256 --> 00:03:10,325
Scott: just a plain Body sheet see I like the plane.

48
00:03:10,345 --> 00:03:20,213
Rym: I like a really minimalistic car like I like really small really streamlined solid colors Like solid colors, but I mean money.

49
00:03:20,274 --> 00:03:22,562
Rym: I just buy a new Miata like right now It depends.

50
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:31,244
Scott: the thing is is whenever you look at the dealers or at least not the dealers the manufacturers of cars You know you're really smart about bodywork Like every.

51
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:53,912
Scott: I've gone to lots of car websites and things and customized cars and those little you know web application thingies and You just click and it every you can like change like the front grille piece You could change the little wings in the back and you could change like these runners around like pieces of body work near the doors trunk and windows and fenders and all that stuff.

52
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:58,395
Scott: and Whenever you click on the more expensive thing it just looks better.

53
00:03:58,777 --> 00:04:03,611
Scott: every time It's like oh look without the wing the car is kind of ugly.

54
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:10,770
Scott: you click add wing and it's like oh the car looks awesome Now and then it's like hi I wonder what that little piece of body around the fender is.

55
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,120
Scott: you click and it changes around the fender and you're like oh?

56
00:04:13,782 --> 00:04:14,766
Scott: That looks so much better.

57
00:04:14,807 --> 00:04:15,510
Scott: I can't believe it.

58
00:04:15,951 --> 00:04:17,457
Scott: and then by the time you've clicked all of them.

59
00:04:17,498 --> 00:04:18,324
Scott: It's like the cars $5,000 more.

60
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:23,169
Rym: Well, we'll see how it goes cuz we'll be out test driving this weekend.

61
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:25,877
Scott: Yep gonna test drive a stick.

62
00:04:25,897 --> 00:04:26,800
Scott: see how it goes.

63
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:31,851
Rym: Yeah, because both of us we usually both had stick cars like back in the day I didn't have one, but I do.

64
00:04:31,892 --> 00:04:32,740
Rym: we knew how to drive a stick.

65
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,578
Rym: Yeah, it's been a long time since either of so much has touched a clutch.

66
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:41,375
Scott: yep But the the guy said you know I was like yeah, I haven't driven one in six years.

67
00:04:41,395 --> 00:04:42,720
Scott: the guy was like oh, it's no problem.

68
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,931
Scott: I've known people come in here and after a few minutes.

69
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,580
Scott: They're all good, so it's not my car.

70
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,686
Scott: I'm gonna be test driving.

71
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:54,871
Scott: so if I destroy the transmission oops Yeah, yeah.

72
00:04:56,182 --> 00:05:00,717

Rym: and also three short OAVs.

81
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:31,787

83
00:05:33,737 --> 00:05:39,306

Scott: it's the lotus island of FMA.

86

Scott: But oh, it's the lotus island of the FMA movie.

87
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:50,239
Rym: Yes So it's all the characters that are in the movie.

88
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:54,678
Rym: So if you haven't seen all of the show there might be characters in the show that are not in this.

89
00:05:54,979 --> 00:06:05,603
Rym: yeah Yeah, and you know what if you haven't seen full metal alchemist see it because Spoilers abound and while we won't spoil it for you someone else will And the movie will.

90
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:06,526
Scott: yep.

91
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:10,457
Rym: in fact just knowing about the movie can spoil parts of it.

92
00:06:10,518 --> 00:06:12,662
Rym: so go see the show Mmm.

93
00:06:12,985 --> 00:06:17,046
Scott: Yeah, I wasn't a hundred percent sure the Movie spoiled the show.

94
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:19,495
Rym: well you obviously hadn't seen the second trailer.

95
00:06:19,535 --> 00:06:23,291
Rym: They released that showed things I don't know.

96
00:06:23,351 --> 00:06:30,320
Scott: I saw stuff and And I saw like the first few minutes of the movie, and it didn't seem to do anything, but now I'm not so sure.

97
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,629
Scott: I gotta watch this damn movie.

98
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:32,435
Scott: Why don't we just watch it?

99
00:06:32,535 --> 00:06:33,139
Rym: We've got it.

100
00:06:33,421 --> 00:06:35,809
Scott: Let's watch it like this weekend or something all right.

101
00:06:35,869 --> 00:06:38,498
Rym: We might have a review of the FMA movie real soon.

102
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,878
Scott: Yeah Then we'll know for sure.

103
00:06:47,771 --> 00:06:48,515
Rym: Well that was quick.

104
00:06:48,655 --> 00:06:49,760
Scott: not so much news today.

105
00:06:49,801 --> 00:06:51,207
Scott: You know since Apple was yesterday.

106
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:57,390
Rym: yep Yep, yep, but my thing of the day is kind of might be boring, but I think it's kind of neat.

107
00:06:57,912 --> 00:06:58,936
Rym: You've all played monopoly.

108
00:06:59,498 --> 00:07:04,918
Rym: you know that kind of terrible board game That's really popular in the US for some reason.

109
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:11,721
Rym: they make a million million knockoffs of it like Monopoly New York Edition or Monopoly RIT Edition.

110
00:07:12,001 --> 00:07:13,927
Scott: well they always call it RIT-opoly.

111
00:07:14,228 --> 00:07:19,173
Scott: Yeah, or College-opoly or Stupid-opoly.

112
00:07:19,795 --> 00:07:26,150
Rym: well, this is a nice little website that has a bunch of optional rules that make the game somewhat bearable.

113
00:07:27,191 --> 00:07:33,255
Scott: It's not hard to make the game somewhat bearable if you enable some auctioning and you get rid of Stupidity on free party.

114
00:07:33,275 --> 00:07:34,218
Rym: you know by default.

115
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:37,150
Rym: I mean most people at least that I've known who play Monopoly.

116
00:07:37,871 --> 00:07:41,545
Rym: They haven't read the rulebook since they were a little kid, and they just play it wrong.

117
00:07:41,565 --> 00:07:44,757
Scott: a lot of people Do play it wrong like I know.

118
00:07:44,777 --> 00:07:51,765
Rym: a lot of people play where all the money that goes to the bank for whatever reason goes Into the middle and if someone lands on free parking they get all that money.

119
00:07:51,986 --> 00:07:52,227
Rym: what?

120
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:54,939
Scott: yeah That's the craziest one I ever heard.

121
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:59,610
Rym: that's like the standard house rule that a lot of people I've seen crazy ones, but nothing that crazy.

122
00:08:00,172 --> 00:08:01,296
Scott: I mean the way, I've seen.

123
00:08:01,336 --> 00:08:08,470
Scott: it is like you put $100 in the middle and then if Someone lands on free parking they get the hundred dollars.

124
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:14,131
Scott: And then you take two hundred dollars from the bank and put it in the middle And then if you land on free parking you get 200.

125
00:08:14,131 --> 00:08:19,994
Rym: Yeah, a lot of people just take all the money that goes to the bank for like luxury tax or whatever And they put it in the middle.

126
00:08:20,194 --> 00:08:25,090
Rym: whoa and anyone who gets bankrupted by the by the board goes in there to all their stuff.

127
00:08:25,534 --> 00:08:26,139
Scott: That's crazy.

128
00:08:26,321 --> 00:08:31,724
Rym: yeah it is and Most people don't realize that the official monopoly rules at least a long time ago.

129
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:35,409
Rym: if you land on a property And you don't buy it it gets auctioned off.

130
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:37,982
Rym: Yep, most people don't play that way.

131
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:39,167
Scott: That's the way you should play.

132
00:08:39,448 --> 00:08:46,590
Scott: yeah I remember there was an old DOS game that used to play that way by default But with a checkbox you could turn it to the the way most people play.

133
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:56,987
Scott: But we played it with the auction method and we'd be sitting there with our fingers on like the different buttons on the keyboard And an IBM ps1 with like little colored bits appearing.

134
00:08:57,047 --> 00:09:04,198
Scott: and is a varying really monopoly is just such a It seems like with German board games.

135
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:09,195
Scott: You know there's not really a lot of effort in like Manipulating the game pieces.

136
00:09:09,837 --> 00:09:17,183
Scott: some games have quite a bit, but not so not usually a whole bunch of the time Yeah, and usually when there's a lot of manipulation in a game German board game.

137
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,950
Rym: It's always like intrinsic to the game.

138
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,414
Scott: Yeah, and monopoly.

139
00:09:20,454 --> 00:09:22,681
Scott: there's a lot of like this extra manipulation.

140
00:09:22,721 --> 00:09:32,182
Scott: like you have to fiddle with the the houses and the hotels You have to deal out all the cards of properties and flip them over You have to hand out the money is a huge pain in the ass.

141
00:09:32,223 --> 00:09:33,710
Scott: you get you know and then you get the chance.

142
00:09:34,176 --> 00:09:38,470
Rym: See if I was a little kid I never just my cards my whole family use money, and I just sat there with a calculator.

143
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,667
Scott: I was out there with a calculator calculator and the memory.

144
00:09:41,352 --> 00:09:49,689
Scott: But monopoly is really a game that I really can't stand to play it Unless you have like a real fancy set to kind of add something to it that doesn't add anything.

145
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:51,682
Scott: Yeah, no it does a little more fun.

146
00:09:51,702 --> 00:09:52,527
Rym: No it doesn't.

147
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:52,950
Rym: yeah.

148
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:56,162
Rym: You could play monopoly with pieces of paper where you wrote the numbers down.

149
00:09:56,222 --> 00:10:01,060
Scott: you could but you ever play monopoly with like the big Fancy wooden set with the gold pieces and everything.

150
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,305
Rym: no cuz that's just stupid.

151
00:10:02,807 --> 00:10:03,730
Scott: It's stupid to buy one.

152
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,296
Scott: I agree anybody buys one isn't?

153
00:10:05,316 --> 00:10:05,617
Scott: you know?

154
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:08,770
Rym: that's the equivalent of saying like yeah war or maybe a dumb game.

155
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:12,590
Rym: But uh if you play with solid gold cards it becomes awesome.

156
00:10:13,954 --> 00:10:15,350
Scott: It does become a little more interesting.

157
00:10:15,711 --> 00:10:20,408
Scott: You know what while the game is stupid dumb and boring you at least have something else to pay attention to.

158
00:10:20,429 --> 00:10:21,412
Rym: um You know what.

159
00:10:21,673 --> 00:10:26,969
Rym: if that if you actually are serious, and you're not just you know joking then you should really take up baccarat.

160
00:10:27,814 --> 00:10:28,719
Scott: What's baccarat?

161
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:30,450
Rym: baccarat is the game they play in casinos?

162
00:10:30,991 --> 00:10:35,266
Rym: And it's pretty much the epitome of the fact that you're playing baccarat, and it's all.

163
00:10:35,326 --> 00:10:38,810
Rym: fancy is the only thing It's got going for it really the stupidest game.

164
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:44,427
Rym: I'm not going to explain how to play baccarat because it's stupid like engine Bond movies.

165
00:10:44,447 --> 00:10:47,799
Rym: people play it in a movie There's always like the famous rich guy, and he plays baccarat.

166
00:10:48,141 --> 00:10:50,490
Rym: It's like in the area in casinos like behind this rope.

167
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:54,207
Rym: It's it's the stupidest game ever all right.

168
00:10:54,288 --> 00:10:57,940
Scott: Yeah But I mean if you're gonna play it just don't play it.

169
00:10:58,622 --> 00:10:59,405
Scott: Oh, yeah of course.

170
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:02,850
Rym: and if you're gonna play it I mean just play it correctly.

171
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,111
Rym: You know.

172
00:11:03,131 --> 00:11:06,808
Rym: follow the rules and maybe do some of these nice optional rules like my favorite one is.

173
00:11:07,551 --> 00:11:09,798
Rym: You know the two utilities in the game how?

174
00:11:09,818 --> 00:11:11,142
Rym: they're completely useless.

175
00:11:11,564 --> 00:11:12,486
Scott: They're mostly useless.

176
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:13,610
Rym: They're completely useless.

177
00:11:14,451 --> 00:11:16,417
Rym: There's absolutely no reason to ever buy them.

178
00:11:16,737 --> 00:11:19,004
Rym: the return on investment is pretty much nothing.

179
00:11:19,425 --> 00:11:21,030
Rym: they cannot help you win the game ever.

180
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:28,650
Rym: Well these people suggested that they should count as railroads and just extend the railroad money table accordingly.

181
00:11:29,911 --> 00:11:34,510
Rym: That's not so bad that fit because then it makes you the railroad Baron strategy a real big strategy.

182
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,857
Scott: It does Not a bad one.

183
00:11:37,917 --> 00:11:38,824
Scott: I've heard worse.

184
00:11:39,308 --> 00:11:41,013
Scott: Yep I've heard of the.

185
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:48,577
Scott: there's another one where if you go to jail you got like bail yourself out or get someone to bail you out and Jail more of a suck.

186
00:11:48,718 --> 00:11:52,150
Rym: all you have to do to fix that is if you're in jail you can't collect rent.

187
00:11:53,031 --> 00:11:54,997
Scott: Yeah, well isn't that a rule anyway?

188
00:11:55,419 --> 00:11:55,619
Rym: No?

189
00:11:56,302 --> 00:11:58,770
Scott: Oh that we've always played where if you're in jail you don't get dick.

190
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:07,130
Rym: That's a good thing to do because otherwise it's a good strategy to put yourself in jail for most of the game after all the Yeah, also you think you should make it harder to get at it.

191
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,910
Scott: Or like you know cuz what can you do to get out of jail like pay?

192
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,800
Scott: $50 or wait three turns or wait three turns.

193
00:12:12,921 --> 00:12:14,547
Scott: Oh if you roll doubles though you get out right.

194
00:12:14,688 --> 00:12:17,039
Scott: yeah That's kind of okay.

195
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,609
Scott: It should be harder to get at it or get it.

196
00:12:19,232 --> 00:12:23,990
Rym: It shouldn't be hard to get out of jail because getting into jail is completely random arbitrary and stupid.

197
00:12:24,991 --> 00:12:26,823
Rym: There's nothing you do that puts you in jail.

198
00:12:26,883 --> 00:12:27,809
Rym: It just happens to you.

199
00:12:29,031 --> 00:12:31,157
Scott: Well because the game is called monopoly right.

200
00:12:31,277 --> 00:12:42,464
Rym: so the logic is that you're committing illegal business dealings constantly Build my hotels and I provide legitimate services to people in exchange for money.

201
00:12:43,447 --> 00:12:44,470
Scott: I find that laughable.

202
00:12:46,051 --> 00:12:48,558
Rym: Hey, you ever stayed in my apartment in Baltic.

203
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,487
Scott: Yeah, what are you doing with that monocle top hat?

204
00:12:51,668 --> 00:12:52,330
Scott: sack of money?

205
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:53,415
Rym: Monocle top hat?

206
00:12:53,455 --> 00:12:55,269
Rym: what I was always the car or the little dog.

207
00:12:55,511 --> 00:12:58,824
Scott: I was always the battleship, but that's not the poor the iron, but that's not the point.

208
00:12:59,426 --> 00:13:04,469
Scott: the point is That mr.. Monopoly is an evil business fucker.

209
00:13:05,213 --> 00:13:08,289
Rym: No, what if he's one of the old-school capitalists who give money back?

210
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,174
Rym: You know the kind?

211
00:13:09,234 --> 00:13:12,753
Scott: if they were around today would also be in jail Like Rockefeller.

212
00:13:12,794 --> 00:13:21,083
Scott: he built Rockefeller Center, and so yeah he the same thing that people like Warren Buffett and Bill Gates first they do a bunch of evil and they get real rich.

213
00:13:21,103 --> 00:13:22,869
Scott: then they feel bad so they become all.

214
00:13:24,312 --> 00:13:27,220
Scott: You know the word for people who give money away philanthropy.

215
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,406
Scott: yeah, that's the one I knew.

216
00:13:29,486 --> 00:13:30,609
Scott: it was tropic something.

217
00:13:34,853 --> 00:13:35,819
Rym: See the problem is a lot of.

218
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,429
Rym: I mean back in the day there were bad people But at least there were bad people who did some good.

219
00:13:40,011 --> 00:13:45,766
Rym: It seems like most of the uber capitalists these days don't give anything back, and they're not even really capitalist.

220
00:13:45,847 --> 00:13:50,889
Scott: Adam Smith like yeah They just say the word capitalism to me, and I can do whatever I want even if it's evil.

221
00:13:52,651 --> 00:13:53,073
Rym: Yeah, we'll do it.

222
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:54,360
Rym: We'll get into that some other day.

223
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,848
Scott: Yeah, we don't do that.

224
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,362
Rym: Scott Do you have a thing of the day?

225
00:13:57,383 --> 00:13:57,464
Rym: Yeah?

226
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:06,785
Scott: I had a funny thing, but and it was a video and it was on Google videos as usual and at work I got to it just fine, but now when I get home to go check it out.

227
00:14:06,866 --> 00:14:07,549
Scott: It's like gone.

228
00:14:08,631 --> 00:14:09,635
Scott: So I had to pick something else.

229
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:12,929
Scott: That's not as cool, but also not completely lame.

230
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:15,750
Scott: You know the Hubble telescope?

231
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,670
Scott: Yeah, yeah, it's awesome, and it takes lots of nice pictures that everyone enjoys.

232
00:14:21,552 --> 00:14:26,870
Scott: It can actually take crazy high-resolution pictures, but you never see those if you're just a Joe Schmo.

233
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:36,730
Scott: Well on the hubble website They have here you can download full Hubble telescope resolution pictures.

234
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:38,448
Rym: They're big.

235
00:14:39,535 --> 00:14:43,658
Scott: the biggest one is 18,000 by 18,000 pixels.

236
00:14:43,878 --> 00:14:51,230
Rym: there's a warning on the website telling you that if you don't have a lot of RAM Don't download it because it'll probably crash your computer.

237
00:14:51,764 --> 00:15:01,809
Scott: Yeah The big JPEG file is 23 megabytes and the small one which is only six thousand by six thousand pixels Is is only like three megabytes.

238
00:15:02,674 --> 00:15:06,250
Scott: But they have TIFF images which have absolutely no compression whatsoever.

239
00:15:07,492 --> 00:15:10,486
Scott: The small one is 50 megs and the big one is almost 400 megs.

240
00:15:11,792 --> 00:15:15,302
Scott: Yeah, I don't even have 512 megs of RAM all right.

241
00:15:15,342 --> 00:15:16,466
Rym: I dare you to open that.

242
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:19,417
Scott: I could but Linux Wouldn't care, but Linux wouldn't care.

243
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:25,065
Scott: it thrash though Windows would crash on my computer But on my work laptop has two gigs of RAM, so I'd be safe.

244
00:15:25,628 --> 00:15:30,688
Rym: maybe Definitely, but still because I was thinking about Windows allocating that RAM properly.

245
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:33,259
Scott: yeah I just don't want to sit around to download a 400 meg 18,000 by 18,000 picture.

246
00:15:36,931 --> 00:15:41,810
Scott: But I did look at the low-resolution JPEG which is only eight thousand six thousand by six thousand.

247
00:15:41,931 --> 00:15:47,160
Scott: Let me tell you it's really awesome to look at this thing Like stars, which you can't even see.

248
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:52,819
Scott: you can see like a speck on this thing and Like in the nebula galaxy.

249
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,229
Scott: I think it's a nebula looked in the middle nebula to me.

250
00:15:56,053 --> 00:15:58,626
Scott: You can see like all the details of the nebula.

251
00:15:58,646 --> 00:16:07,540
Rym: It's crazy All right, so it's anime day, and we've got two anime to review and they're all pretty terrible.

252
00:16:08,446 --> 00:16:14,325
Rym: Yeah Yeah, we watched a mobile suit Gundam F91 which is a movie.

253
00:16:14,466 --> 00:16:24,010
Rym: This is a Gundam movie made in 1991 and we watched Akagi Which is some new show and we're gonna start with Gundam because I got to get this out of my head.

254
00:16:25,162 --> 00:16:32,511
Rym: Yep, so well let's talk about the movie what it is first all right well It's it's in the whatever the universal whatever got entries.

255
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:35,019
Scott: Yeah, it's the it's the default Gundam universe.

256
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,878
Scott: it story about.

257
00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:42,935
Scott: There's some space colonies and then these this pirate group called like.

258
00:16:42,975 --> 00:16:43,296
Scott: what was it?

259
00:16:43,316 --> 00:16:46,070
Scott: crossbone vanguard crossbone vanguard.

260
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:51,158
Rym: they're like like think about Revolutionary France reactionaries, that's what they're like.

261
00:16:51,439 --> 00:16:57,480
Scott: yeah So these people want to take over a bunch of space colonies because what's has been peace for so long?

262
00:16:58,162 --> 00:17:12,512
Scott: That like all the earth the big head honchos of earth are like just relaxing on earth being losers And you know being all leisurely and not being serious and You know all the normal people have to stay in the colonies.

263
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:13,940
Scott: They can't go relax on earth.

264
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:20,646
Scott: so the crossbone vanguard is like we're gonna take over a bunch of colonies and get those people to convert to our us and then go attack the earth.

265
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:29,207
Rym: now that may sound dumb and it is and it may sound like we're oversimplifying but We're not.

266
00:17:29,369 --> 00:17:30,419
Scott: well see that in itself.

267
00:17:30,741 --> 00:17:37,180
Scott: Well not exactly being the greatest plot anyone's ever come up with isn't really what makes it so incredibly dumb.

268
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,168
Rym: That's like point one percent of the show.

269
00:17:39,188 --> 00:17:43,650
Rym: see if you've seen Gundam seed or the original Gundam or any of those long Gundams.

270
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,701
Rym: you know 50 episodes of robots Mm-hmm.

271
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:51,880
Rym: imagine if they took all that plot and all those characters and all those events and scrunch them down into a little movie.

272
00:17:52,422 --> 00:17:55,559
Scott: See now this isn't like a summary movie like you know the macross movie.

273
00:17:55,921 --> 00:17:59,420
Scott: Well the macross plus movie takes the four or was it four?

274
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:08,357
Scott: I think there are four episodes of the macross plus oav and it just compresses them into a single movie and takes some you know Modifications, so it makes sense.

275
00:18:09,475 --> 00:18:13,771
Scott: the This isn't a summary of some 50 episode series.

276
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:23,500
Scott: This is a movie that was made as a movie You know with content that appears nowhere else, and they didn't like edit it into a shorter movie.

277
00:18:23,921 --> 00:18:26,009
Scott: They just literally just squished it.

278
00:18:26,451 --> 00:18:29,060
Rym: It's just scene scene scene scene scene scene scene with no breakup.

279
00:18:29,421 --> 00:18:34,380
Rym: No, we I mean honestly it may sound like real vague when we actually talk about this in more detail.

280
00:18:35,022 --> 00:18:39,738
Rym: That's because we watched it carefully and we have almost no idea as to what actually happened.

281
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:50,520
Rym: pretty much They introduced characters like so rapidly like I mean it starts out fine like there's like eight Characters that I could identify, but that's fine because there's like this hectic or scene.

282
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,938
Rym: There's all these civilians and like people are attacking the colony, and it's ignoring the war.

283
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,068
Rym: It's just showing these civilians trying to get away.

284
00:18:57,088 --> 00:19:00,283
Rym: It's real hectic and hard to follow which I thought was cool You know.

285
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:05,504
Rym: and then it stays just as hectic and hard to follow For the whole movie.

286
00:19:06,147 --> 00:19:09,660
Rym: and they introduced like nine more characters, and then two of them die like right away.

287
00:19:10,521 --> 00:19:15,120
Rym: They introduced characters that all look the same so you can't tell who's who and everyone is everyone's father.

288
00:19:15,703 --> 00:19:27,538
Scott: Yeah, and they keep referring to people like different people with different names And you're not quite sure which names go with which people yet But they're already referring to people off-screen by their name, and you're like who which one is which I don't know.

289
00:19:27,558 --> 00:19:35,434
Rym: also There ends up being to one character who has two different names, and she's confused because they're calling by name She doesn't recognize which only served to confuse us.

290
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:39,740
Scott: Yeah It's just real confusing and kind of silly.

291
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:50,780
Rym: I mean there's a guy in an orange suit who's someone's dad and we sat there watching the show debating with each other whose dad It was and then there was another guy in another orange suit.

292
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:57,187
Scott: It was also someone's dad someone else's dad and one guy was doing good and one guy was doing bad And you couldn't really tell what was going on.

293
00:19:57,207 --> 00:20:00,140
Rym: there was a significant amount of time where I thought they were the same person.

294
00:20:00,765 --> 00:20:02,155
Scott: I definitely thought they were the same person.

295
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:11,560
Rym: for a few minutes It and it just keeps going and and going and going and there's these bugs And they try to kill everyone in the colony, but and then there's this woman.

296
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,329
Rym: There's another woman who looks just like her who has nothing to do with her.

297
00:20:14,349 --> 00:20:14,931
Rym: mm-hmm.

298
00:20:15,412 --> 00:20:19,909
Rym: people defect from both sides to the other sides But they don't actually show them defecting.

299
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:22,399
Rym: they just show them on the other side, and you don't know why they're there.

300
00:20:22,741 --> 00:20:26,743
Scott: Yeah, it's like they mentioned it in like a sentence or like like.

301
00:20:26,784 --> 00:20:36,714
Scott: there are characters like The the guy the crossbone vanguard's Leader's son is like a robot pilot, and you see him like early on.

302
00:20:36,734 --> 00:20:37,456
Scott: you're like okay.

303
00:20:37,497 --> 00:20:38,520
Scott: I know that kind of character.

304
00:20:38,622 --> 00:20:43,274
Scott: That's kind of like Who's the crazy guy in Escaflowne with the white hair?

305
00:20:43,435 --> 00:20:44,078
Rym: Oh Delando?

306
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:44,380
Rym: Yeah?

307
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,380
Scott: It's kind of like that kind of character not as crazy though, but you know spills the same niche.

308
00:20:50,203 --> 00:20:54,809
Scott: You see him once then you see him again But his character doesn't develop, and you don't.

309
00:20:55,552 --> 00:20:56,355
Scott: it's just like oh here.

310
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,800
Scott: He is says a sentence about him.

311
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,162
Scott: Nothing really happens with him And it's like what.

312
00:21:00,643 --> 00:21:05,419
Scott: why did they name this character and put him there to fill my head with more things to figure out?

313
00:21:06,361 --> 00:21:07,851
Scott: When he doesn't really mean anything?

314
00:21:07,872 --> 00:21:09,120
Scott: shit has not had that character.

315
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,435
Scott: He didn't do anything for the movie, and there were a lot of characters like that.

316
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,620
Scott: Yeah shouldn't have been in there.

317
00:21:14,021 --> 00:21:14,825
Rym: It's like there's no one.

318
00:21:14,905 --> 00:21:16,091
Rym: no faceless drone.

319
00:21:16,211 --> 00:21:17,778
Rym: every single person was a person.

320
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,620
Rym: We have a 90% of the people which would have been cool if I if I'd known what the hell was going on.

321
00:21:23,441 --> 00:21:25,531
Rym: Yeah, I was never sure who to pay attention to.

322
00:21:25,892 --> 00:21:29,587
Rym: there'd be someone and you think they're important And then they just wouldn't be.

323
00:21:29,607 --> 00:21:36,111
Scott: it's like you know in a Gundam when they have like the bridge of a ship you had Of the good ship you always had the captain and the whole.

324
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:38,620
Scott: all the people in there are recognizable and constant.

325
00:21:39,421 --> 00:21:41,370
Scott: So it's like when I look at the captain of the ship.

326
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,600
Scott: I'm like oh, there's the captain of the ship.

327
00:21:43,681 --> 00:21:44,759
Scott: I got to pay attention to them.

328
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,166
Scott: That's another character to remember.

329
00:21:46,246 --> 00:21:47,271
Rym: captain does almost nothing.

330
00:21:47,351 --> 00:21:47,954
Scott: ten does nothing.

331
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,320
Scott: they didn't even need to put the captain in the words.

332
00:21:49,762 --> 00:21:53,578
Rym: The captain looks just like the female protagonist, and I thought it was her.

333
00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:53,940
Rym: at first.

334
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,956
Rym: I couldn't figure out why she was captaining a ship.

335
00:21:56,178 --> 00:21:57,644
Scott: yep It was messed up.

336
00:21:58,506 --> 00:22:03,020
Rym: and and then the female protagonist to make it worse everyone's everyone's everyone's dad and mom whatever.

337
00:22:03,862 --> 00:22:06,360
Rym: She has two dads and one of them dies suddenly.

338
00:22:06,966 --> 00:22:09,384
Rym: Yeah, and by dies suddenly I mean quite literally.

339
00:22:09,405 --> 00:22:15,433
Rym: they're talking and then he just like does a pratfall and she cries And I still don't know what the hell that was all about.

340
00:22:16,216 --> 00:22:22,155
Scott: and it's like all Usual scenes that animes have for you to figure stuff out right are removed.

341
00:22:22,356 --> 00:22:29,314
Scott: so like you know she Her dad dies she cries, but then they don't have like the mourning and consolation scenes like you.

342
00:22:29,354 --> 00:22:35,752
Scott: completely forget that like her dad died And it doesn't have any meaning because you didn't have time to like absorb that.

343
00:22:36,173 --> 00:22:40,220
Scott: it was just onto the next thing and that's never Really referred to again.

344
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:45,940
Scott: Maybe like in passing like in a sentence once and I just I didn't identify with any character.

345
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:47,340
Rym: I didn't follow any character.

346
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:55,470
Rym: I wasn't entirely sure who the protagonist was until I noticed one guy's name was said more often than anyone else's names And I figured out who that name was associated.

347
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:56,013
Scott: Yeah the problem.

348
00:22:56,093 --> 00:22:57,380
Scott: I had him figure out the protagonist.

349
00:22:57,601 --> 00:23:00,920
Scott: I did read the protagonist name on the back of the DVD case so that helped.

350
00:23:02,022 --> 00:23:12,486
Scott: But at the same time is I really didn't know which one he was because at the beginning they had The opening scene was it was a guy on stage and a guy in the crowd And they both seemed like they were main guys.

351
00:23:12,586 --> 00:23:14,952
Scott: It was Dwight and Arno right.

352
00:23:15,674 --> 00:23:16,757
Rym: I don't fucking know.

353
00:23:17,198 --> 00:23:22,279
Scott: anyway one of them Had like a dad who was a military guy and one of them was the main guy.

354
00:23:23,321 --> 00:23:35,037
Scott: But at the beginning of the show they were both had equal screen time and were doing equally important things and had equal Interaction with like the head female who was pretty quickly obviously the head female

355
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:35,679
Rym: yep

356
00:23:36,101 --> 00:23:40,098
Scott: Though I didn't know which one is the main character until like one guy just stopped showing up.

357
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:42,488
Rym: Yeah, whatever happened to him.

358
00:23:42,508 --> 00:23:44,358
Scott: I don't know don't ask me.

359
00:23:46,882 --> 00:23:52,420
Rym: The thing is that the one thing that this show had is one of the really high production values for 1991.

360
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:59,160
Scott: Yeah, it was made in 91, and it looked like it was made in like 2000 something I just wish they would have put some of that money into making it not suck.

361
00:24:00,103 --> 00:24:04,480
Scott: They put all the money into animation and robot battles which I guess is okay.

362
00:24:04,982 --> 00:24:11,080
Rym: I mean and I gotta say it had every single Gundam cliche Right down to like right away.

363
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,666
Rym: There's the the moral of the show.

364
00:24:12,706 --> 00:24:16,540
Rym: war is bad like right away someone dies and they have this moment of oh war is horrible.

365
00:24:16,641 --> 00:24:17,408
Rym: Why do people fight?

366
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:21,995
Rym: Oh my god, and Then they have a guy in a mask who's the evil guy?

367
00:24:22,015 --> 00:24:25,889
Rym: he's the square boss and then there's the guy who you think is the evil guy who isn't really.

368
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:29,948
Rym: and there's there's the guy who's gonna sacrifice himself to save everyone.

369
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,966
Scott: and Yeah, it's got everything.

370
00:24:33,608 --> 00:24:35,193
Rym: It's just it's not worth watching.

371
00:24:35,213 --> 00:24:37,300
Rym: I don't I don't know what happened.

372
00:24:37,641 --> 00:24:41,819
Rym: I bet I could watch it two more times and still have no clue how it ended or what was going on.

373
00:24:43,422 --> 00:24:44,367
Scott: You know what it's good for.

374
00:24:44,387 --> 00:24:50,175
Scott: if you just like watching robot battles This is pretty much the the most robot battle you can get.

375
00:24:50,276 --> 00:24:50,778
Scott: you know what?

376
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:56,960
Rym: yeah There's a lot of robot battle But it doesn't focus on any one robot fighting long enough for you to know what's going on in the fighting.

377
00:24:57,402 --> 00:25:01,100
Scott: Yeah, but you just like watching robot battles in their raw form.

378
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:01,963
Scott: This is the way to go.

379
00:25:02,003 --> 00:25:06,080
Rym: you can't even tell who's fighting on what side or who's winning or losing or who's shooting at who?

380
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,177
Rym: It's just robots flying around hitting each other.

381
00:25:09,182 --> 00:25:13,048
Scott: Yeah, I'm saying is that if all you want to see is robots flatter on hitting each other This is the way to go.

382
00:25:13,109 --> 00:25:14,059
Scott: it has no other purpose.

383
00:25:15,956 --> 00:25:17,429
Rym: All right also that they all.

384
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:31,520
Rym: it's also real implausible and Not just implausible in a giant robots way But implausible in that every major plot development seems to occur when someone overhears someone saying something Despite the fact that they're in space and separate mechs.

385
00:25:32,941 --> 00:25:44,732
Scott: Well, I think they say they like a mention in passing a few times like one time people had a direct wire hookup between Gundams and yeah Or something because at the end they all get psychic powers.

386
00:25:44,993 --> 00:25:46,377
Scott: Oh, yeah, there was some psychic power.

387
00:25:46,397 --> 00:25:47,520
Scott: should I completely ignored?

388
00:25:47,781 --> 00:25:54,260
Rym: Yeah, and then the the the final scene which had a chance to make the movie meaningful in some minor way and they ruined it.

389
00:25:55,445 --> 00:26:02,222
Rym: We're not gonna spoil it But if you watch this movie and you get to the end and you think wow that was kind of sad and poignant no It's stupid.

390
00:26:02,783 --> 00:26:02,964
Scott: Yep.

391
00:26:03,084 --> 00:26:03,606
Rym: They ruin it.

392
00:26:03,987 --> 00:26:05,411
Rym: so who bought this movie.

393
00:26:06,053 --> 00:26:07,958
Scott: I bought it on sale at media play so whatever.

394
00:26:08,219 --> 00:26:12,917
Scott: yeah I mean if it was full price, I would have been pissed but 40% off who cares?

395
00:26:14,681 --> 00:26:20,600
Rym: Now the other show we watched and all I got to warn you about this show is that of the three anime?

396
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,080
Rym: We watched to figure out what to talk about.

397
00:26:23,421 --> 00:26:24,746
Rym: This was the best of them.

398
00:26:25,187 --> 00:26:28,157
Rym: so beware next week when we talk about the other two.

399
00:26:28,178 --> 00:26:37,692
Scott: Yeah So this one is called Akagi like Mount Akagi from initial D Which is kind of funny because this is an initial D type show.

400
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:48,320
Scott: only it's an initial D type show about It's it's you know it's also if you don't know initial D. It's a Hikaru no go type of show or Prince of Tennis or any of those shows.

401
00:26:48,401 --> 00:26:57,612
Scott: That's like about a hobby you know and then it's people doing that hobby dramatically and with energy and Teaching you about the hobby of you know whatever it is.

402
00:26:58,375 --> 00:27:01,218
Scott: the hobby for this show is mahjong.

403
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,083
Rym: Mahjong not.

404
00:27:03,103 --> 00:27:11,052
Scott: mahjong is in what you play on your freaking Windows computer and not mahjong as in what old Jewish ladies play It's or even what old Chinese guys play.

405
00:27:11,313 --> 00:27:12,820
Scott: Yeah, it's mahjong of what?

406
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:25,078
Scott: gambling Japanese yakuza play and The thing that really got me is This not it's not like go or you could keep teaching people things for like 50 episodes or more of it.

407
00:27:25,981 --> 00:27:29,715
Rym: Explain how to teach how to play mahjong in like half the first episode.

408
00:27:29,956 --> 00:27:30,920
Scott: It's not a difficult game.

409
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:41,170
Rym: I could teach you in like five minutes I mean, but I mean there's a lot of ceremony and a lot of craft and a lot of stupid arbitrary things to remember in mahjong But it's essentially gin rummy with little tile.

410
00:27:41,311 --> 00:27:46,274
Rym: Yeah, it's not if the game is just complete lock Basically once you know the basic statistics.

411
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:47,119
Rym: It's just a game of luck.

412
00:27:47,883 --> 00:27:53,573
Scott: It's pretty much a game of luck and watching what other people put out But you can just look on the table and see what they put out.

413
00:27:53,633 --> 00:27:54,980
Scott: It's it's yeah information.

414
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,532
Scott: So it's paying attention and luck now.

415
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,340
Rym: I'll warn you ahead of time you fry don't care.

416
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,417
Rym: We're gonna spoil the first episode of the show.

417
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,896
Rym: we're gonna spoil the one plot point that we find in this show.

418
00:28:07,538 --> 00:28:09,209
Rym: because Yeah

419
00:28:10,242 --> 00:28:21,145
Scott: So the show starts out where this guy is playing mahjong against some gamblers supposedly for his light against some yakuza Supposedly for his life or at least for his debt, and he's not doing so well And he's all frustrated

420
00:28:21,245 --> 00:28:29,319
Rym: and it's going into great detail about what's going on in mahjong Hand and he's talking like I've got the blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

421
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:29,841
Rym: I don't.

422
00:28:29,881 --> 00:28:38,449
Scott: I can't say mahjong jargon fast enough, so yeah, you know just like all those other shows like oh he's you know He's got car head cam.

423
00:28:38,489 --> 00:28:38,690
Rym: Yeah.

424
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:40,076
Scott: Oh his car is turbo.

425
00:28:40,096 --> 00:28:40,780
Scott: You're not gonna win.

426
00:28:41,021 --> 00:28:43,789
Scott: You know he's gonna do the super drift technique blah blah blah.

427
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:44,813
Scott: only mahjong talk.

428
00:28:45,134 --> 00:28:51,240
Rym: Yeah, but there's no move of God and mahjong It's just pick up a tile and throw a tile down and then flip all your tiles over when you win.

429
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:53,431
Scott: Yeah, that's all it is so.

430
00:28:53,652 --> 00:28:56,324
Scott: and of course they had the gambling part Which is at least add something.

431
00:28:56,544 --> 00:29:00,436
Rym: no all it adds is flip the tiles over and then collect money from people.

432
00:29:00,797 --> 00:29:13,060
Scott: Yeah pretty much anyway, so The guy is playing for his life, and then all of a sudden this Punk kid shows up like a 13 year old punk kid just shows up at this gambling parlor.

433
00:29:13,821 --> 00:29:19,980
Scott: So the first they're like get the hell out of here, but the guy who's losing is like hey Maybe I need to take a break cuz I'm all nervous.

434
00:29:20,482 --> 00:29:22,753
Scott: Maybe I'll use this kid as an excuse.

435
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,140
Scott: You know what you know what luck.

436
00:29:24,961 --> 00:29:26,868
Scott: So he talks to the kid for like a minute or two.

437
00:29:26,948 --> 00:29:31,082
Rym: then and this is all like crazy dramatic Crazy.

438
00:29:31,142 --> 00:29:34,700
Rym: everything that happens in the show every single instant is just filled with drama.

439
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:36,907
Scott: That's what they do in these types of shows.

440
00:29:36,947 --> 00:29:39,076
Scott: We still need a word for these types of shows.

441
00:29:39,136 --> 00:29:39,679
Rym: Yeah, we do.

442
00:29:40,603 --> 00:29:42,700
Scott: I'll make one up eventually.

443
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:46,600
Rym: So he's talking to this kid and then he like the Yakuza want to play again.

444
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:53,320
Rym: They get back to playing their mahjong, and he comes to a point where he could throw out like a two or a five tile.

445
00:29:54,221 --> 00:29:59,195
Rym: And he's debating because tossing out the five tile is the like the the risky.

446
00:29:59,516 --> 00:30:02,892
Rym: if the other guy needs it he wins But otherwise I have a really good chance of winning.

447
00:30:02,912 --> 00:30:10,710
Rym: or the two tile Which is like the safe throw out and he's about to throw out the two and then the kid Yells at him like you can't do that.

448
00:30:10,951 --> 00:30:12,820
Rym: that just means you're a gambler at the end of his rope.

449
00:30:13,343 --> 00:30:14,995
Rym: You're not taking the risk blah blah blah.

450
00:30:15,035 --> 00:30:19,140
Rym: I can tell Yeah, and the guy's like what you played mahjong and he's like mahjong.

451
00:30:19,883 --> 00:30:21,078
Scott: Yeah, I never played that in my life.

452
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:26,109
Rym: I can just tell by looking at you and then the guy has this dramatic internal monologue where he's all.

453
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:31,015
Rym: oh Yes, I must take the risk blah blah blah because I am a gambler.

454
00:30:31,055 --> 00:30:34,867
Scott: then he throws out the five Mm-hmm, and he wins that hand actually.

455
00:30:35,148 --> 00:30:35,328
Rym: Yep.

456
00:30:35,368 --> 00:30:35,749
Rym: He does.

457
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:48,447
Scott: and then eventually within a minute or two this is on the first episode by the way, the kid be starts playing this game and The kids playing and he starts to kick major ass like whoa, he's winning.

458
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:54,151
Scott: Then a cop shows up and you learn the plot of the kid is that he's a bad punk kid and he's gonna get in Trouble.

459
00:30:54,612 --> 00:31:00,370
Scott: so then you have the cop hanging out with the main character guy while this kid plays mahjong against the Yakuza All right.

460
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:01,374
Rym: now what's going on here?

461
00:31:01,434 --> 00:31:02,598
Rym: because this is this is like.

462
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,566
Rym: this is what made the show go from.

463
00:31:04,666 --> 00:31:09,683
Rym: this is the stupidest thing ever - this is the stupidest thing ever with one moment that made us scream and yell and laugh.

464
00:31:10,084 --> 00:31:13,637
Scott: and it's also the one thing that Raises this above the other three shows.

465
00:31:13,677 --> 00:31:15,805
Scott: we watched by the by once nanometer.

466
00:31:15,945 --> 00:31:19,029
Rym: cuz this they do something in the show That's never really been done before.

467
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:29,703
Rym: so He's playing and he's got like the makings of an awesome awesome hand that'll like super win him the game of mahjong Yep, like a million million points like the dragon tiles.

468
00:31:29,843 --> 00:31:31,089
Scott: and the guy who's who?

469
00:31:32,232 --> 00:31:36,213
Scott: The guy who's in super debt sees the hand and he's like, oh my god He's.

470
00:31:36,414 --> 00:31:38,283
Scott: does he know this guy's never played before?

471
00:31:38,343 --> 00:31:39,730
Scott: does he know what he has in his hand?

472
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:51,646
Rym: But then the pile he needs to complete this thing and pull off the awesome passes by until eventually like multiple times Until they're all gone and there's no way he can win now and the guy watching is like what?

473
00:31:51,867 --> 00:31:53,433
Rym: Oh, no now I'm gonna die.

474
00:31:53,534 --> 00:31:54,900
Rym: He's gonna lose cuz he's stupid.

475
00:31:55,302 --> 00:31:57,210
Scott: He could have just won and gotten a zillion dollars.

476
00:31:57,313 --> 00:31:57,869
Scott: Oh my god.

477
00:31:58,151 --> 00:32:09,134
Rym: So then the cops are there and they're distracting and then he looks up and he sees the kids hand again And he sees that no the kid actually does have the whole crazy dragon hand Cuz.

478
00:32:09,154 --> 00:32:10,702
Scott: what the kid did is cheat.

479
00:32:11,164 --> 00:32:12,811
Rym: Yeah friggin cheated He.

480
00:32:12,832 --> 00:32:14,858
Scott: just he just pulled the tiles right off the table.

481
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,947
Scott: And since everyone else was worried about the cops being Yakuza.

482
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:21,616
Rym: They didn't notice Yeah, I didn't see that coming.

483
00:32:22,077 --> 00:32:25,810
Scott: Yeah, I mean imagine if initial D had cheating or if he car no go ahead cheating.

484
00:32:25,931 --> 00:32:29,249
Rym: Yeah, imagine that her car no go he just you know flipped over the other guys.

485
00:32:29,591 --> 00:32:32,383
Rym: He flipped the other guy's tile or a little a pebble off the board.

486
00:32:32,845 --> 00:32:36,349
Rym: Yep when he wasn't looking That'd be great.

487
00:32:37,112 --> 00:32:46,007
Rym: So then like eating technique go Spoilers for like the next many episodes of the show and it just follows the initial D format of.

488
00:32:46,027 --> 00:32:51,270
Rym: he fights bigger and bigger Mahjong guys as far as I can tell like and the cheating thing just keeps going.

489
00:32:51,331 --> 00:32:53,350
Rym: There's one guy who tries to cheat against him, but he'll cheat back.

490
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:58,630
Rym: Well, which I guess is all they could do because mahjong there's not much to that game.

491
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:02,330
Scott: Yeah, imagine if we made a show we should I got we should make a parody where it's coin tossing.

492
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:04,802
Scott: I am the ultimate coin tosser.

493
00:33:04,842 --> 00:33:08,857
Scott: I always know if it is heads or tails thing But I put the poison in your cup.

494
00:33:08,897 --> 00:33:10,583
Rym: therefore blah blah blah blah blah.

495
00:33:10,844 --> 00:33:11,366
Scott: Uh-huh.

496
00:33:11,687 --> 00:33:12,550
Scott: I have a two-headed coin.

497
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:14,395
Scott: Aha, but look at mine.

498
00:33:14,415 --> 00:33:20,963
Scott: It is actually a. it is it is not a two-headed coin But it has holograms on both sides so I can make it heads or tails.

499
00:33:21,024 --> 00:33:24,460
Rym: at my whim heads or tails I say it's going to land on its edge.

500
00:33:24,782 --> 00:33:25,003
Rym: what?

501
00:33:25,043 --> 00:33:26,470
Rym: but such a thing has never happened.

502
00:33:27,052 --> 00:33:28,970
Scott: I'll use my magic always lend an edge coin.

503
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:31,848
Scott: Look at my sleight of hand skill.

504
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:45,360
Scott: Apparently this thing started out in this manga that was printed in a mahjong magazine like a few pages You know in this magazine once in a while, and it got crazy popular somehow I don't know how because the arts.

505
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,149
Scott: so we should talk about the art being all weird.

506
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:49,445
Rym: It's real real weird.

507
00:33:49,525 --> 00:33:50,190
Rym: like for a second.

508
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:56,849
Rym: I thought it reminded me of a show that's old and crappy called ji baku, but I watched ji baku again And no I was just dumb.

509
00:33:57,392 --> 00:34:00,302
Scott: Imagine if everyone's real pointy and scratchy.

510
00:34:00,743 --> 00:34:02,590
Rym: pointy and scratchy with really thick lines.

511
00:34:03,471 --> 00:34:11,888
Scott: Yeah, so like the noses are like knives and the chins are like knives like they'll stab you It's just scary.

512
00:34:13,612 --> 00:34:14,335
Rym: It's worth watching.

513
00:34:14,376 --> 00:34:15,141
Rym: if you want to laugh.

514
00:34:15,161 --> 00:34:18,949
Scott: I Recommend watching at least just the first episode.

515
00:34:19,612 --> 00:34:24,389
Scott: It's like you know if you know anything about mahjong at all if you've ever seen it or even if you haven't seen it.

516
00:34:24,911 --> 00:34:30,909
Scott: Just to watch it and laugh, but to watch more than one episode you got a really like it for some reason.

517
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:34,728
Rym: Yeah, I mean even initial D Which is the same kind of show really?

518
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:40,690
Rym: When we first saw it we saw the first four episodes and we walked out of our anime club thinking that was the stupidest thing Ever.

519
00:34:40,993 --> 00:34:44,848
Rym: hmm, but I wonder if he wins and then we end up watching the whole show and loving it.

520
00:34:45,712 --> 00:34:46,174
Scott: Well, it's cuz.

521
00:34:46,214 --> 00:34:49,889
Scott: initial D. At least had music to get an energy like you could get into it.

522
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:55,530
Scott: You know it like had the suspense that you could if you if you really wanted to enjoy the show.

523
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,955
Rym: Hey, Akagi has suspense.

524
00:34:57,034 --> 00:34:58,199
Rym: It has a whole shit ton of it.

525
00:34:58,259 --> 00:34:59,323
Rym: It's nothing but suspense.

526
00:34:59,544 --> 00:35:01,029
Scott: Yeah, but it didn't have the same.

527
00:35:02,431 --> 00:35:04,677
Scott: There's just something you know granted.

528
00:35:04,717 --> 00:35:15,729
Scott: It's the same genre of show and initial D. Doesn't have much more to it than Akagi does but at least car racing at least has a little bit of.

529
00:35:16,993 --> 00:35:20,608
Scott: It's not a first of all it's not just randomness It's actually something to it.

530
00:35:21,192 --> 00:35:22,798
Scott: And it has that live action.

531
00:35:22,818 --> 00:35:26,190
Scott: like cars are driving suspense as opposed to mahjong.

532
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:28,809
Rym: We're just people sitting there and at least go and across.

533
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:30,456
Rym: well It's also just people sitting there.

534
00:35:30,476 --> 00:35:31,460
Rym: at least go.

535
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,167
Rym: has the actual strategy.

536
00:35:33,207 --> 00:35:33,730
Rym: think about it.

537
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:37,220
Scott: Yeah, every episode of a carnal go you learn like techniques and things.

538
00:35:37,781 --> 00:35:39,346
Scott: so there's actually something to that.

539
00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:43,784
Rym: Prince of tennis is kind of But whatever I don't think it's a tennis actually teaches you about ten.

540
00:35:43,804 --> 00:35:48,041
Scott: no no no I think that might not even actually be in the same genre.

541
00:35:48,322 --> 00:35:50,410
Scott: I think it's a. it's just a like a high school story.

542
00:35:50,852 --> 00:35:51,334
Scott: No, I don't know.

543
00:35:51,395 --> 00:35:52,601
Scott: I haven't really seen it.

544
00:35:52,721 --> 00:35:55,098
Rym: It is very much the same kind of show Is it really?

545
00:35:55,138 --> 00:35:56,190
Rym: it has more drama in it?

546
00:35:56,310 --> 00:36:02,108
Rym: But it's very much the prodigy kid who becomes awesome and faces greater and greater challenges, okay?

547
00:36:03,931 --> 00:36:05,037
Scott: But anyway yet it.

548
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:11,710
Scott: this show is just like all those shows except It's missing that little tiny bit of magic that makes it something you want to watch.

549
00:36:11,951 --> 00:36:15,669
Rym: I guess I was assuming that maybe they made it as a joke to make fun of those other shows.

550
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:19,362
Scott: That would it be alright, but then why do you assume that?

551
00:36:19,402 --> 00:36:21,930
Scott: because then why did we use computers to like?

552
00:36:23,751 --> 00:36:27,782
Rym: The mahjong tiles if you've seen the first season of initial D like the first half.

553
00:36:28,183 --> 00:36:30,450
Rym: It's pretty much PlayStation 1 graphics mm-hmm.

554
00:36:30,731 --> 00:36:37,503
Rym: So it's normal animation, but whenever the cars are on it's like this terrible 3d Whatever they do the mahjong tiles like that.

555
00:36:37,884 --> 00:36:42,350
Scott: Yeah, well, it's not PlayStation 1 graphics, but it's not exactly the greatest.

556
00:36:42,691 --> 00:36:48,210
Scott: It's just obvious CG for the mahjong tiles when the rest of it is the horrible pointy animation.

557
00:36:49,093 --> 00:36:53,670
Scott: It's horrible very horrible, and this is the best of the shows we watched.

558
00:36:54,493 --> 00:36:57,343
Rym: Yeah, I mean we watched a couple other shows.

559
00:36:57,364 --> 00:36:58,648
Rym: What was that wings of?

560
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:06,568
Rym: Raima Rheem Rina Rheem Rheem yeah, and then some show that ended up just being about like magical cat girls.

561
00:37:06,969 --> 00:37:09,349
Scott: Yeah We'll talk about those next week.

562
00:37:09,751 --> 00:37:15,670
Rym: Yeah, cuz if you thought Gundam f91 was confusing this wings of whatever show is like that times a million.

563
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:19,339
Rym: Exactly we pretty much sat there watching it.

564
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,261
Rym: We watched the whole.

565
00:37:20,743 --> 00:37:21,646
