1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,710
Emily: It's Monday March 6th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,835
Emily: We talk about how not to suck at podcasting.

3
00:00:15,297 --> 00:00:16,340
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:17,042 --> 00:00:21,840
Rym: So we're back after a long weekend of geek a long weekend of not enough sleep.

5
00:00:22,212 --> 00:00:26,499
Rym: Yeah What was originally gonna be two friends driving up from North Carolina to hang out?

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:37,280
Scott: ended up as all of our friends come over our house and trashing it and We didn't even get to do that much stuff because we spent a lot of time in transport and sleep and eat.

7
00:00:37,841 --> 00:00:41,994
Rym: Yeah, yeah the best part was how I lost my cell phone in Manhattan.

8
00:00:42,737 --> 00:00:48,480
Rym: good job, yeah Well, actually I found out later that I lost it on the train to Manhattan and I love technology.

9
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:54,702
Rym: So I lost my cell phone right and I keep trying to call my cell phone on someone else's cell phone all day And it doesn't answer.

10
00:00:55,624 --> 00:00:58,974
Rym: and then my Scott here gets an email or an instant message, right?

11
00:00:59,736 --> 00:01:00,518
Scott: Oh, is this a message?

12
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:12,380
Rym: Yeah So and then Scott says oh it's uh this guy aim him here and he aims me and he's like, hey I got your cell phone And I offered to give him some money and he offered to mail it to me and I should have it tomorrow.

13
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:16,619
Rym: So once again New Yorkers are awesome, and they're not as evil as all you.

14
00:01:17,381 --> 00:01:18,908
Rym: Now New Yorkers seem to think they are.

15
00:01:19,249 --> 00:01:21,740
Scott: of course, you're still pretty crummy for losing that cell phone.

16
00:01:22,342 --> 00:01:22,825
Rym: What do you want?

17
00:01:22,845 --> 00:01:24,391
Rym: I had it on a belt clip under a trench coat.

18
00:01:24,813 --> 00:01:26,380
Scott: Yeah, see I used to lose shit all the time.

19
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,471
Scott: I can't tell you how many Timex watches I've lost.

20
00:01:28,571 --> 00:01:30,180
Rym: I haven't lost my wallet since middle school.

21
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:30,862
Rym: I'm proud of that.

22
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:35,375
Scott: I lost a wallet like freshman year of college sophomore year.

23
00:01:35,435 --> 00:01:35,957
Scott: I don't remember.

24
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:38,448
Scott: It doesn't matter I haven't lost anything since then.

25
00:01:38,468 --> 00:01:40,700
Scott: so I haven't lost anything like four years before that.

26
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:48,115
Rym: I used to lose shit all the time, but the dude who found my cell phone when I was offering, you know Hey, I'll give him some money whatever since you know, I do GeekNights.

27
00:01:48,477 --> 00:01:52,952
Rym: I offered him Hey, if you have a website or anything you want to promote I'll help you out.

28
00:01:53,695 --> 00:01:57,785
Rym: and his response to that was well, actually Well, what does he want to promote?

29
00:01:57,926 --> 00:02:05,579
Rym: I don't know if any of you out there actually live in Tarrytown, New York It's a one of the burbs kind of of New York City or if you know anyone who does.

30
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:15,600
Rym: But this EF international language school is looking for host families to host Chinese and I forget what other countries exchange students.

31
00:02:16,383 --> 00:02:23,265
Scott: So if you live in Tarrytown and you have a house and you want to host an exchange student, that's a pretty Specific kind of person.

32
00:02:23,306 --> 00:02:23,828
Rym: Yeah, it is.

33
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:25,135
Rym: But I mean you might know someone.

34
00:02:25,175 --> 00:02:26,040
Rym: we've got a lot of eclectic.

35
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:28,674
Rym: I mean, we got the dudes in Australia.

36
00:02:28,695 --> 00:02:29,418
Rym: We got the guy in the UK.

37
00:02:29,843 --> 00:02:30,620
Scott: I'll tell you what.

38
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:37,946
Scott: If anyone listen to this podcast ends up hosting one of the families for this program in Tarrytown, New York I'll give you five dollars.

39
00:02:38,368 --> 00:02:40,919
Scott: All right, that's how sure I am that none of you are.

40
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:44,334
Rym: Yeah, like if you know a guy promised guy I'd plug the site.

41
00:02:44,354 --> 00:02:45,240
Rym: there's gonna be a link there.

42
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,218
Rym: So if this is at all interesting to you, check it out.

43
00:02:49,022 --> 00:02:52,878
Scott: You know, maybe from moving to Tarrytown soon or maybe you want to host an exchange student.

44
00:02:52,918 --> 00:02:55,533
Scott: so much You're gonna move to Tarrytown and get a house there.

45
00:02:55,654 --> 00:02:55,956
Rym: You know what?

46
00:02:56,036 --> 00:02:58,125
Rym: if you do that I'll give you another five dollars.

47
00:02:58,326 --> 00:02:58,968
Scott: Holy crap.

48
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:00,272
Rym: and and and we'll let you.

49
00:03:00,292 --> 00:03:01,597
Rym: we'll give you a free GeekNights' t-shirt.

50
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,564
Scott: Oh Good thing they don't exist.

51
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:03,946
Rym: Yeah.

52
00:03:04,046 --> 00:03:05,692
Rym: No, we don't get a t-shirt that says GeekNights.

53
00:03:05,793 --> 00:03:10,431
Scott: on it in some fashion I'll take one of my old dirty t-shirts with a sharpie.

54
00:03:11,054 --> 00:03:12,439
Rym: Yeah, that was the expected joke.

55
00:03:13,521 --> 00:03:13,685
Rym: Awesome.

56
00:03:13,706 --> 00:03:18,515
Scott: Yeah alright, so I don't know if you realize.

57
00:03:18,636 --> 00:03:21,299
Scott: but Firefox how much does Firefox cost?

58
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,791
Scott: Nothing, how much money does Mozilla make from Firefox?

59
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:28,660
Rym: I would assume nothing you assume wrong?

60
00:03:29,222 --> 00:03:31,309
Scott: Oh, let's start a guessing game ready.

61
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:32,433
Scott: make a guess.

62
00:03:33,015 --> 00:03:34,199
Rym: All right, how many dollars?

63
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:34,440
Scott: what?

64
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,168
Rym: All right, it's either gonna be real low or real high.

65
00:03:37,348 --> 00:03:45,539
Scott: Well, this is how much money Mozilla has made from Firefox ever as in as long as Firefox has existed ever.

66
00:03:46,567 --> 00:03:53,478
Rym: Mm-hmm a million dollars higher a billion dollars lower.

67
00:03:53,498 --> 00:04:03,539
Rym: a million dollars and a dollar 72 million dollars, that's about 72 million more than I expected, right?

68
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:05,997
Scott: So You know where this money comes from?

69
00:04:07,042 --> 00:04:07,905
Scott: It's kind of crazy.

70
00:04:08,487 --> 00:04:10,435
Scott: All right in the top right of Firefox.

71
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:11,759
Scott: You'll notice that little searchy box.

72
00:04:12,422 --> 00:04:13,666
Rym: Do people pay to be there?

73
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:17,820
Scott: No, no, no, you notice how Google is the default for that searchy box.

74
00:04:18,141 --> 00:04:30,465
Scott: all right, if I make a Google search in that searchy box, and then I get to let's say I search for I don't know fire which is my favorite Google search And I know he's not kidding.

75
00:04:30,485 --> 00:04:31,991
Rym: He searches for it fairly regularly.

76
00:04:32,012 --> 00:04:33,738
Scott: All right, so let's actually do it.

77
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,525
Scott: right now Let's go to the searchy box in Firefox and type in Fire press.

78
00:04:38,585 --> 00:04:41,035
Scott: enter on the right side of this page.

79
00:04:41,055 --> 00:04:46,091
Scott: There's an advertisement for fire Planning a career in firefighting.

80
00:04:46,232 --> 00:04:47,400
Scott: explore the possibilities.

81
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:49,486
Scott: Www.collegeboard.com.

82
00:04:49,546 --> 00:04:50,829
Rym: Is there anyone selling fire?

83
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:54,860
Scott: Yeah, there's actually a whole bunch of paid for links on the side of this page.

84
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,939
Scott: There's one two, three, four, five six eight eight sponsored links on the side of this page.

85
00:05:00,422 --> 00:05:03,300
Scott: Outstanding if I click one of these links, right?

86
00:05:04,223 --> 00:05:09,780
Scott: That means that the person who paid for that advertisement gives money to Google for that ad.

87
00:05:10,361 --> 00:05:14,794
Scott: For you know, the impression or the click or whatever does Mozilla get a cut.

88
00:05:15,696 --> 00:05:23,280
Scott: if I click on this link Then 80% of the money that that advertiser gives to Google actually goes to Mozilla.

89
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:29,679
Rym: I did not know that and I never would have guessed that This is only for the paid links on the side, of course.

90
00:05:30,201 --> 00:05:35,716
Scott: However, you know over time that has amounted to 72 million dollars.

91
00:05:35,756 --> 00:05:40,034
Rym: surprisingly when I search for a product I have more than once clicked on one of those links to get what I wanted.

92
00:05:40,436 --> 00:05:41,099
Scott: I click on them.

93
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:42,442
Scott: You know what?

94
00:05:42,503 --> 00:05:55,991
Scott: You usually happens when I'm looking to buy something like but when I'm looking for information I never click there, but I'm looking to buy a product and what will happen is usually like a specialized online Store will appear over there and that's what I want.

95
00:05:56,032 --> 00:05:56,614
Scott: That's useful.

96
00:05:56,674 --> 00:05:57,076
Scott: I don't care.

97
00:05:57,096 --> 00:06:04,766
Scott: if it's an ad it's the link I want you know, and if it saves me going to the 10th page to click where no one gets any money for the same Link, it's just stupid course.

98
00:06:04,786 --> 00:06:08,480
Rym: Sometimes I'll search for mesothelioma and click on all the links to cost evil people money.

99
00:06:08,981 --> 00:06:10,206
Scott: Yeah, that works.

100
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,139
Rym: I urge all of you to search for mesothelioma and click on all the links.

101
00:06:14,882 --> 00:06:16,910
Scott: Maybe we should do a show on mesothelioma.

102
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:18,175
Scott: And what's the other one?

103
00:06:18,195 --> 00:06:21,647
Scott: Uh, What is the other one begins with like a P?

104
00:06:22,771 --> 00:06:23,413
Rym: I don't know.

105
00:06:23,955 --> 00:06:25,540
Scott: Yeah, I don't know either.

106
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,279
Scott: I forgot it used to get posted to my site all the time.

107
00:06:28,862 --> 00:06:35,543
Rym: so I'm sure a lot of you have seen that AOL has opened up the AIM instant messaging SDK.

108
00:06:35,824 --> 00:06:41,018
Scott: finally I can freaking get a client besides the aim client and send files reliably to my friends.

109
00:06:41,179 --> 00:06:44,329
Rym: Oh, yeah Yeah, you'd think that now the headline seems great.

110
00:06:44,429 --> 00:06:44,730
Rym: All right.

111
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,234
Rym: Now there's an official SDK.

112
00:06:46,575 --> 00:06:48,020
Rym: I can officially interface with aim.

113
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,624
Rym: It'll be great.

114
00:06:49,369 --> 00:06:49,993
Rym: It won't be a hack.

115
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:52,928
Rym: It won't be reverse engineered Upon further reading.

116
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,014
Rym: it's bullshit.

117
00:06:54,034 --> 00:06:55,080
Scott: What do you mean?

118
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:55,863
Scott: How could it be bullshit?

119
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:58,273
Scott: They give you software that allows you to interface with aim, right?

120
00:06:58,294 --> 00:06:59,840
Rym: All right, they give you the software.

121
00:07:00,181 --> 00:07:06,339
Rym: However, there are a number of restrictions as to what you can actually do with that software.

122
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:10,134
Scott: now Are these license on paper restrictions or physical software?

123
00:07:10,174 --> 00:07:14,190
Rym: restrictions are license on paper You'll go to jail as opposed to physical.

124
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,680
Scott: You can just get around so I could just take the SDK and do it.

125
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,938
Rym: Anyway, you could but you get in trouble.

126
00:07:19,983 --> 00:07:24,298
Scott: Is there like some sort of key system where they know like Google has with their SDKs?

127
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:24,880
Rym: I don't know.

128
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,844
Rym: I didn't look too much into it.

129
00:07:25,964 --> 00:07:27,089
Scott: Yeah, that'd be interesting to know.

130
00:07:27,109 --> 00:07:29,820
Scott: cuz if there is then you really couldn't disobey the license.

131
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:36,719
Rym: Yeah, the gist of it is that for one you can use this for whatever you want any non-commercial purposes, but you cannot one.

132
00:07:37,702 --> 00:07:45,929
Rym: You create a client or use the SDK with a client that is quote multi-headed Meaning it can connect to more than one type of network.

133
00:07:46,471 --> 00:07:47,013
Scott: What the hell.

134
00:07:47,173 --> 00:07:48,438
Scott: that's all defeats the whole purpose.

135
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:49,140
Scott: No one's gonna use it.

136
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,124
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

137
00:07:50,164 --> 00:07:51,389
Scott: that's like if GM used it.

138
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:53,980
Rym: They'd have to drop support for I don't know everything.

139
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,480
Rym: Yeah, well, there goes that - if you're going to use it on any sort of wireless device like a PDA or a cell phone up.

140
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,008
Rym: Nope, you have to get a separate pay license.

141
00:08:03,048 --> 00:08:04,376
Scott: Oh, see that's the freaking scam.

142
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,080
Scott: I hate the worst.

143
00:08:05,483 --> 00:08:07,259
Scott: Oh my that's almost as bad as the first one.

144
00:08:07,481 --> 00:08:15,113
Scott: Oh trying to get aimed to work on anything cuz I have a Blackberry right and there's no reason that this Blackberry piece of hardware Could not be a really really good.

145
00:08:15,254 --> 00:08:16,240
Scott: I am client, right?

146
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:21,960
Scott: The problem is if all the software that makes it be an I am client costs a lot of money.

147
00:08:22,341 --> 00:08:27,400
Scott: And the only reason that costs a lot of money is because like this crazy vendor lock-in bullshit.

148
00:08:27,732 --> 00:08:31,574
Rym: Yeah so this won't solve that because you can't use the code if you're gonna do anything like that.

149
00:08:31,794 --> 00:08:36,611
Rym: such bastard number three if You want to make something for any sort of corporate use at all?

150
00:08:36,972 --> 00:08:38,480
Rym: No, you have to pay for that separately, too.

151
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,073
Scott: Well, I guess I aim doesn't want you competing with their aim corporate products.

152
00:08:42,453 --> 00:08:46,579
Scott: that makes corporate products are terrible I know but at least it makes a little more sense than the first two.

153
00:08:46,882 --> 00:08:48,119
Rym: Well the first two look at the first one.

154
00:08:48,401 --> 00:08:52,439
Rym: They don't want people to be able to connect to multiple networks because then why do they need AOL?

155
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,369
Scott: Mmm, because they're still using AOL.

156
00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:57,000
Scott: They're just also using other things.

157
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,573
Rym: Honestly, the only reason I use AOL is because some of my idiot friends won't give it up.

158
00:09:00,894 --> 00:09:01,175
Rym: Yeah.

159
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,369
Scott: Yeah use jabber Jabber jabber jabber jabber.

160
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:05,599
Scott: I'll do a show on jabber one time.

161
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,268
Rym: I'm getting evil looks from our guest who is not.

162
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:14,558
Rym: her microphone is turned off currently and it'll be turned on the second half of the show And she uses aim.

163
00:09:16,001 --> 00:09:32,181
Scott: I Don't know how old-school all the listeners be but When I had a computer it ran DOS and Windows 3.1.

164
00:09:32,181 --> 00:09:38,579
Rym: Yeah, like DOS as in there's no such thing as networking and there's no such thing as um a gooey.

165
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,329
Rym: Well, I guess you could use das shell 32 bits.

166
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:47,170
Scott: Yeah, Windows 3 1 1 and Really you only have two mouse buttons that do anything.

167
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,680
Scott: the third one just kind of does nothing unless you're playing a game.

168
00:09:50,182 --> 00:09:59,291
Rym: in Windows 3 1 1 you could minimize your whole computer and then you couldn't do anything and When you exited Windows you went to DOS instead of turning your computer off.

169
00:09:59,692 --> 00:10:00,013
Rym: Yeah.

170
00:10:00,174 --> 00:10:01,176
Rym: Yeah, that was fantastic.

171
00:10:01,196 --> 00:10:02,480
Rym: Those were awesome days.

172
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:08,482
Scott: Yeah, so, um, some people still use Windows 3.1 and I don't blame What.

173
00:10:08,865 --> 00:10:10,958
Scott: oh, well, you don't use it as your primary OS.

174
00:10:11,662 --> 00:10:15,016
Scott: Oh, oh, but some people still use it because you got to play those old Windows 3.1 game.

175
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,881
Rym: Well, I'll know to you that OS to warp kick the shit out of Windows 3 1.

176
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:23,797
Scott: Actually, I had OS to warp and Windows 3.1.

177
00:10:23,797 --> 00:10:24,400
Rym: I still have it.

178
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:31,287
Rym: In fact, I have the installers for it for the most current version that you guys can't get right now About 15 feet away from me in the closet

179
00:10:31,768 --> 00:10:32,250
Scott: and I work

180
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,996
Rym: for IBM and we still use OS

181
00:10:33,996 --> 00:10:42,011
Scott: 2 and I had DOS All on the same computer and OS 2 war worked pretty well and had some fancy stuff But it didn't have any soft software that was useful.

182
00:10:42,553 --> 00:10:43,517
Rym: Oh, it was very robust.

183
00:10:43,557 --> 00:10:44,360
Rym: It was good for servers.

184
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:50,936
Scott: So I always ended up dual booting and going back to you know, DOS windows to You know play DOS games.

185
00:10:51,036 --> 00:11:05,180
Scott: Yeah, so anyway anyway somebody Awesome made this thing called Cal Myra c a l m i r a. it's Cal Myra XP 4.0.

186
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,060
Scott: Calmyra XP 4.0 is something you can download.

187
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:17,974
Scott: Put it on your windows 3.1 computer and it makes your windows 3.1 computer Look and function as if it was Windows XP.

188
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:19,440
Rym: now Scott showed this to me.

189
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,657
Rym: He just showed me a screenshot and asked what's what's up with this picture?

190
00:11:22,677 --> 00:11:23,260
Rym: and I looked at it.

191
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,600
Rym: It was Windows XP with maybe a little skin to it and I couldn't figure it out.

192
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:33,820
Scott: It looks exactly like Windows XP and there's even a start menu and in everything and it's really scary.

193
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,765
Scott: But this computer is actually Windows 3.1.

194
00:11:35,765 --> 00:11:36,628
Scott: Now.

195
00:11:36,688 --> 00:11:46,016
Scott: It's an actual old slow computer - you know, they don't say that I have a feeling they're running Windows 3.1 on DOS box or something.

196
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:47,220
Rym: That would make sense.

197
00:11:47,883 --> 00:11:50,816
Rym: I mean not many people have 486 is kicking around that still work.

198
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:54,516
Scott: Well Yeah, it's the only explanation I can come up with for it.

199
00:11:54,597 --> 00:11:59,917
Scott: But I Just got to say Windows 3.1 like back in the day.

200
00:11:59,937 --> 00:12:03,040
Scott: It was great But if you try to use it now, you just want to kill yourself.

201
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,427
Scott: I mean They don't even have the X button on the windows.

202
00:12:05,447 --> 00:12:16,560
Scott: you had to double click in that in the top left and the little menu That was like my shape kind of thing Yeah, and like you couldn't really and you had to use the program manager for everything.

203
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:36,032
Scott: So like the desktop was always hidden behind the program manager, but the icons on the desktop you wanted to use and uh Yeah, yeah, so that's why in Windows 95 the the program manager was still there but it was hidden and they gave you the start menu instead and that's what it was all about, but Yes, and now this makes Windows 3.1 real usable.

204
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:41,860
Scott: So you can get a computer and load it up with a pile of Windows 3.1 games and you're good to go.

205
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,176
Rym: It's actually if you have a really old slow computer a lot of new Linux's.

206
00:12:45,196 --> 00:12:51,639
Rym: you can do stuff with them But Windows 3.1 actually is pretty robust for how little it is and how weak it is.

207
00:12:52,234 --> 00:13:00,824
Scott: Yeah The difference is if you install an old Linux or a Linux designed to run an old computer like Ubuntu lite or something like that You can run Firefox.

208
00:13:01,225 --> 00:13:06,560
Scott: if you decide you want to run wizards 3.1 on your old computer you have to run Netscape 2 gold.

209
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:09,121
Rym: Hey, at least you get Netscape 2.

210
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,145
Scott: You're really badass.

211
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:13,838
Scott: You can get Netscape 3 gold or Netscape 4 point Netscape.

212
00:13:13,878 --> 00:13:17,130
Rym: Whatever Yeah, that one the point at which I switch to IE.

213
00:13:17,611 --> 00:13:17,913
Scott: Yep.

214
00:13:18,073 --> 00:13:19,980
Scott: I have a Windows Netscape communicator CD.

215
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,965
Scott: God you want it?

216
00:13:22,608 --> 00:13:23,070
Rym: No sure.

217
00:13:23,211 --> 00:13:25,280
Scott: Yeah, you can run it in wine.

218
00:13:25,964 --> 00:13:28,239
Rym: Yeah, you know, that's really what I want to spend a weekend doing.

219
00:13:29,482 --> 00:13:32,840
Scott: It might be better than running Windows 3.1.

220
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:45,332
Rym: Alright, so I had one thing of the day, but I saw a new thing just before the show and Since the rule of the thing of the day is that I have to use the coolest thing I've seen on the interwebs since the last time I did a show.

221
00:13:45,352 --> 00:13:46,918
Rym: I have to use this now.

222
00:13:48,142 --> 00:13:50,539
Rym: You're all familiar with fight club and fight clubs.

223
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,612
Rym: Scott here was actually accused of being a member of it's not accused.

224
00:13:55,632 --> 00:13:59,342
Scott: I was you were questioned one level below Suspected.

225
00:13:59,462 --> 00:14:04,240
Rym: so I asked you if an injury you would sustain was due to your participation in a fight club.

226
00:14:04,401 --> 00:14:05,145
Scott: That is correct.

227
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:06,573
Rym: They use the words fight club.

228
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:07,076
Rym: Did they not?

229
00:14:07,136 --> 00:14:07,840
Scott: that is correct?

230
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,558
Rym: I find this hilarious because for any of you who actually know Scott he is weaker than a puppy.

231
00:14:13,482 --> 00:14:14,927
Scott: I'm not weaker than a puppy.

232
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,896
Scott: I could kill a puppy if I wanted to.

233
00:14:17,997 --> 00:14:18,960
Rym: I don't know.

234
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,672
Rym: I think a puppy could just worry you to death.

235
00:14:21,075 --> 00:14:21,840
Scott: Well, it depends.

236
00:14:21,881 --> 00:14:26,392
Scott: I mean if it was a wolf puppy It might bite me and claw me and it wouldn't be happy.

237
00:14:26,413 --> 00:14:28,100
Scott: and then maybe the big wolf would come and eat me.

238
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:37,599
Scott: but if it was like You know one of those little weird tiny dogs that are all scarily small if it was like a puppy one of those Then it really wouldn't have much to do.

239
00:14:40,721 --> 00:14:44,491
Rym: So anyway, this is a fight club and they have videos of their fights.

240
00:14:45,213 --> 00:14:49,551
Rym: now you might wonder why would Rym link to just a fight Club, he's not into fighting.

241
00:14:50,074 --> 00:14:54,431
Rym: Well, uh This is a nerd fight club and you have to see it to believe it.

242
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,400
Rym: Imagine nerds hitting each other with plastic knives.

243
00:14:57,982 --> 00:15:07,330
Scott: Yeah, like two nerds put on little like safety helmets and there's like an officiator and stuff to make sure no one gets hurt And whatnot and they just go at each other with plastic knives.

244
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:10,679
Scott: It's kind of it's like wow, these nerds don't get out.

245
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,639
Rym: Wow, hey, they're getting out more than some other nerds true, but not enough.

246
00:15:17,522 --> 00:15:24,080
Scott: Yeah, one foot out of the closet ain't - All right, anyway.

247
00:15:24,683 --> 00:15:27,460
Rym: So today we were debating we were gonna do a themed week this week.

248
00:15:27,841 --> 00:15:37,044
Rym: Maybe we'll still do one depending on today, but today's gonna be another one of those how not to suck days how not to suck at Podcasting.

249
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,673
Scott: now at least the technical.

250
00:15:38,713 --> 00:15:50,271
Rym: Yeah, we're not gonna talk about you know the like coming up with an idea or learning how to not say um like That's up to you.

251
00:15:50,473 --> 00:16:03,256
Rym: so yeah But just the very basics of one how to make your podcast not sound like an ass To how to use a microphone in a somewhat proper manner, you know all that sort of stuff.

252
00:16:03,356 --> 00:16:07,403
Scott: Yeah, we're not like You know the gods of radio or anything.

253
00:16:07,543 --> 00:16:09,866
Scott: No, but our podcast.

254
00:16:10,026 --> 00:16:18,260
Scott: I know from listening to a lot of podcast including ours that like Some podcasts they have some noise in the background and that's sometimes tolerable.

255
00:16:18,822 --> 00:16:22,300
Scott: You know some of them the interview parts or when they have someone on the phone, it's staticky.

256
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:25,114
Scott: That's tolerable because even real radio stations have that.

257
00:16:25,134 --> 00:16:26,180
Scott: there's nothing you can do about it.

258
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,205
Rym: Well, I'm talking about like.

259
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:30,220
Scott: I'm talking about you podcasters who are so amateur.

260
00:16:30,301 --> 00:16:54,397
Scott: I mean it's okay to be amateur But when you like the volume is in audible or when one guy on the show is Incredibly loud and the other guy is so quiet and I have to keep adjusting my volume as you both talk And I can't hear or when I have to turn the volume in my car up so high that when the next Podcast comes on that's made by someone who knows what they're doing It freaking kills my eardrums and I have to turn it all the way back down.

261
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:57,677
Rym: now We've got two respecters on this because like I said earlier we have a guest.

262
00:16:58,099 --> 00:17:04,440
Rym: now We have here a friend of ours who has been laughing hysterically at how we actually do this podcast off mic.

263
00:17:04,922 --> 00:17:06,267
Rym: But now she's got a mic in our hand.

264
00:17:06,627 --> 00:17:07,551
Rym: So we've got Nuri here.

265
00:17:07,612 --> 00:17:09,720
Rym: So you do a podcast I hear.

266
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,179
Emily: Yeah, I do a podcast about geeky art stuff.

267
00:17:13,501 --> 00:17:14,063
Rym: What's it called?

268
00:17:14,464 --> 00:17:15,810
Emily: Oh, it's called artist alley.

269
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,573
Emily: all one word.

270
00:17:16,874 --> 00:17:18,160
Rym: Yeah, cuz you know, you're getting a link.

271
00:17:18,723 --> 00:17:19,608
Emily: Yeah, I guess so.

272
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:20,979
Emily: I guess I'll be linked in the show notes.

273
00:17:21,921 --> 00:17:27,807
Scott: Tell people the URL if it cuz if they're schmucks and they don't visit the people who don't visit the website Okay.

274
00:17:27,827 --> 00:17:36,015
Emily: Well the URL is www.candycornstudios.com And the easiest way to get to it is to just click on the podcast link.

275
00:17:36,538 --> 00:17:40,138
Rym: Yeah Yeah, and Andy corn if you don't know what candy corn is.

276
00:17:40,199 --> 00:17:41,985
Rym: Well You can go to hell.

277
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,472
Emily: Yeah, there's a good story behind that.

278
00:17:43,693 --> 00:17:45,240
Scott: Oh, we'll let you know on Halloween.

279
00:17:45,601 --> 00:17:46,324
Emily: Yeah, there is.

280
00:17:46,384 --> 00:17:49,176
Emily: I don't know if you guys ever listen to Lewis black.

281
00:17:49,397 --> 00:17:49,818
Scott: Yeah, we do.

282
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:58,051
Rym: I know that I know the bit about Your body the yellow part thinking it'll taste like corn, but it doesn't.

283
00:17:58,372 --> 00:17:59,535
Rym: it tastes like ass.

284
00:17:59,676 --> 00:18:01,120
Scott: then you eat another one you fuck.

285
00:18:03,161 --> 00:18:04,164
Emily: Another detailed story.

286
00:18:04,205 --> 00:18:05,449
Emily: you can come talk to me on the website.

287
00:18:05,991 --> 00:18:08,018
Rym: Yeah, so basically we've got her here.

288
00:18:08,118 --> 00:18:14,140
Rym: one because She came up for the weekend from North Carolina to hang out in New York City, which she had never been to.

289
00:18:19,443 --> 00:18:23,060
Rym: We've got two basic perspectives here on how to make your podcast not suck.

290
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:26,458
Rym: We're gonna have the low-budget version and the no-budget version.

291
00:18:29,162 --> 00:18:30,850
Rym: Yeah, not for any bad reason.

292
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,080
Rym: just she's still in college and we're out of college.

293
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:38,585
Scott: Now the reason we've left out the high-budget version is because if you have a high budget You don't need to know shit.

294
00:18:38,605 --> 00:18:39,589
Scott: you bought stuff.

295
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:41,697
Scott: Yeah, you hired a radio guy or who knows.

296
00:18:41,818 --> 00:18:44,499
Rym: any problem You have with audio can be solved by spending money.

297
00:18:44,861 --> 00:18:52,800
Rym: Yeah, we're gonna talk about how to do it without spending money, which is key because I'm sorry I'd like to listen to podcasts, but most of you out there just don't know how to do this.

298
00:18:53,681 --> 00:19:02,195
Scott: Even it's some like some of you the content is bad, but some of you just despite your content Which I want to listen to I just can't.

299
00:19:02,718 --> 00:19:02,919
Scott: it's just.

300
00:19:04,641 --> 00:19:11,260
Rym: Yeah, we were actually watching Nury earlier on her little Mac laptop working on trying to edit one of her previous podcasts.

301
00:19:11,804 --> 00:19:13,940
Emily: Well, it's not actually that easy on a Mac.

302
00:19:14,101 --> 00:19:19,480
Emily: I my my computer does not have a microphone input or anything like that.

303
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,756
Emily: So I had to get all this crap to hook up something in there so we could it would record.

304
00:19:24,218 --> 00:19:28,219
Rym: Yeah I mean I bought a bunch of equipment, but I have more money.

305
00:19:28,722 --> 00:19:34,529
Rym: But I guess the the nice perspective here is consider this she spent pretty much no money other than you know Like minimal minimal things.

306
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,079
Emily: Well, I got some stuff for free, too.

307
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:38,792
Rym: Yeah, that always helps but you can always get stuff for free.

308
00:19:38,812 --> 00:19:42,980
Rym: if you can't get anything at all for free You might not have and you can't afford to buy anything.

309
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:51,120
Scott: You might not have the resources to do a podcast just yet You might not have any friends and if you don't have any friends That means no one likes to listen to you, which means you probably shouldn't make a podcast.

310
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:58,460
Rym: But basically we've spent Scott and I not counting hosting because actually our hosting hosts a lot more than just GeekNights.

311
00:19:59,143 --> 00:20:01,633
Rym: We spent less than $200 and that includes everything.

312
00:20:04,343 --> 00:20:05,512
Rym: Yep, Nuria spent.

313
00:20:05,552 --> 00:20:06,157
Rym: how much have you spent?

314
00:20:09,243 --> 00:20:11,333
Rym: Total based on all the podcast stuff that you bought.

315
00:20:11,354 --> 00:20:12,600
Rym: that is for the podcast.

316
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,860
Emily: Okay, I spent $40 on the little adapter thingy to connect things to my computer which you out there and probably won't need.

317
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:20,896
Emily: Yeah, unless you have a Mac laptop.

318
00:20:20,976 --> 00:20:31,740
Emily: in which case Well, at least if you have a Mac laptop you get the garage band The built-in microphone on the lap Matt the the laptops.

319
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:34,859
Emily: They sound like ass when you record with them.

320
00:20:35,161 --> 00:20:36,846
Rym: Well, actually that's the first thing we can talk about.

321
00:20:37,488 --> 00:20:39,455
Rym: if your microphone came with your sound card.

322
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,145
Rym: You can't podcast with it It'll sound like ass.

323
00:20:42,607 --> 00:20:45,700
Rym: That's right that that is a universal rule at a minimum.

324
00:20:46,202 --> 00:20:50,616
Scott: It seems to me that the lot like the 20 or 30 dollar logitech headset mics.

325
00:20:50,736 --> 00:20:51,920
Scott: Those are like the minimum.

326
00:20:52,262 --> 00:20:55,740
Scott: They said that's tolerable if you set it up with the right volume and stuff.

327
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:03,717
Emily: Yeah, the microphones that come with the computers tend to pick up so much ambient sound that you just you hear everything else That's going on in the room.

328
00:21:05,062 --> 00:21:06,813
Rym: Yeah, now I'd say what we use.

329
00:21:06,853 --> 00:21:08,600
Rym: we bought like $20.

330
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:14,513
Rym: unidirectional RadioShack mics come with little like stands and everything and If you're low budget, those are definitely the way to go.

331
00:21:14,533 --> 00:21:15,157
Rym: They're like 20 or 30 bucks.

332
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:23,584
Rym: If anything if you're not using a headset or especially if there's more than one person in the podcast get a unidirectional Microphone.

333
00:21:24,128 --> 00:21:25,115
Rym: if you don't know what that means.

334
00:21:25,155 --> 00:21:25,880
Rym: Don't worry about it.

335
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:30,040
Rym: Just get a unidirectional microphone and point it directly at the person who's talking.

336
00:21:30,261 --> 00:21:35,000
Emily: Yeah, I can speak to that because the microphones that I have are not unidirectional.

337
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:49,050
Emily: there's something called cardioid and they pick up sound not just in one direction, but in multiple directions and unfortunately, that means that it picks up all kinds of machine noise and airplanes and people honking on the highway outside and everything.

338
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:52,890
Rym: I Basically like there's omni-directional microphones which are they'll get everything.

339
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:53,755
Rym: They're like the whole room.

340
00:21:54,358 --> 00:21:58,822
Rym: any of you who might have found the lost Episodes of GeekNights that are floating out there?

341
00:21:58,882 --> 00:22:03,229
Rym: before we kind of went live We used a lot of omni-directional microphone in the middle of the room.

342
00:22:04,212 --> 00:22:04,654
Scott: Yeah, that was.

343
00:22:04,695 --> 00:22:07,490
Scott: that was pretty terrible because that was also one that came with the computer.

344
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:11,762
Rym: Yeah, in fact, I'm sitting next to my computer right now and it even looks cheap.

345
00:22:12,204 --> 00:22:13,287
Scott: Yeah, it's it's two bucks.

346
00:22:13,768 --> 00:22:14,129
Scott: It's yet.

347
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:16,600
Rym: Now there's cardioids.

348
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,929
Rym: There's hyper cardioids.

349
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:18,953
Rym: Basically.

350
00:22:19,013 --> 00:22:21,890
Rym: if you don't know anything about audio, this is really gonna be a low-tech.

351
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:26,270
Rym: We're not gonna tell you like the base details of how all this equipment works because that'll be another show.

352
00:22:26,691 --> 00:22:28,035
Rym: This is just how to not suck.

353
00:22:28,617 --> 00:22:38,241
Rym: So if you don't know anything about microphones go to RadioShack ask for a cheap unidirectional dynamic microphone And get the RadioShack brand.

354
00:22:38,281 --> 00:22:39,486
Scott: the other brands just cost more.

355
00:22:39,506 --> 00:22:40,370
Scott: They're almost the same thing.

356
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:45,666
Rym: Yeah Like if they have two microphones and they look kind of the same and once $40 and once $20.

357
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:48,550
Rym: if you don't know the difference You won't notice the difference.

358
00:22:48,811 --> 00:22:49,394
Emily: Oh pick them up.

359
00:22:49,454 --> 00:22:59,415
Emily: first though pick them up and see if it feels comfortable in your hand because if there's one that's $20 And one that's $30 and the one that's $20 is really heavy and hard to hold and the one that's $30 Feels good in your hand.

360
00:22:59,435 --> 00:23:00,498
Emily: It might be worth of 30 bucks

361
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,992
Rym: or by the same token if it feels nice and heavy and solid Yeah,

362
00:23:05,374 --> 00:23:08,529
Scott: yeah, but at the same time they might just put weights in there to confuse you

363
00:23:09,511 --> 00:23:10,134
Emily: What you like.

364
00:23:10,697 --> 00:23:12,826
Rym: actually our old DVD player.

365
00:23:12,846 --> 00:23:18,181
Rym: we bought this crap Crapo DVD player and Inside it the apex.

366
00:23:18,422 --> 00:23:27,865
Rym: Yeah, it felt kind of heavy but inside it was this tiny little like poorly soldered circuit board and Something that I'm pretty sure was just a weight to make it feel more sturdy than it was.

367
00:23:27,885 --> 00:23:30,298
Rym: I Couldn't figure out a use for it.

368
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,230
Rym: It wasn't any sort of electronic device.

369
00:23:32,451 --> 00:23:38,999
Scott: It's like when they sell those little like action figure collectible toys and to make it so you don't know what toy is in Into in each box they put weights.

370
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,245
Rym: Oh, yeah the PVCs.

371
00:23:40,306 --> 00:23:40,969
Scott: Yeah, I hate that.

372
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:43,790
Rym: Now while we're talking about microphones.

373
00:23:45,011 --> 00:23:50,170
Rym: Consider the difference between me saying Jack Thompson and me saying Jack Thompson.

374
00:23:51,313 --> 00:24:07,080
Rym: Now the latter one probably sounded a lot worse Because if you say P's T's any kind of really hard syllable B and D And yeah air comes out of your mouth and it hits the microphone like so But a pupa pupa pupa pupa pupa pupa.

375
00:24:10,095 --> 00:24:15,882
Emily: Okay, air is always coming out of your mouth But on those particular letters it comes out in a really hard fast manner.

376
00:24:15,902 --> 00:24:18,210
Emily: that makes a really loud spike in the sound volume.

377
00:24:18,611 --> 00:24:27,870
Rym: Now spikes aren't that bad normally if you have equipment in the way, but unless you're like us I mean we have a compressor which we'll talk about in a minute and we don't have to worry about it so much.

378
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:34,530
Rym: But if you're not gonna spend a lot of money at all You're probably not gonna have a compressor which means you don't want your audio to clip.

379
00:24:35,194 --> 00:24:44,759
Rym: basically the best way to make audio sound good is you want to record so that the average volume is as high as you can make it On the like the game the input meter.

380
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:50,670
Rym: as you're recording this price in whatever program uses some sort of meter You want to be very close to the top of that all the time?

381
00:24:50,913 --> 00:24:51,968
Rym: But you never want to hit the top.

382
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:56,243
Scott: So you want the vine to be as loud as you can go without going off the edge.

383
00:24:56,444 --> 00:25:12,309
Rym: now if you're popping all the time Let you know P's and T's into the microphone you're gonna have these big spikes Which means you're gonna have to set the input gain the volume you record at a lot lower which means your actual signal is gonna be a lot lower and You can say your noise floor is gonna be real high.

384
00:25:12,772 --> 00:25:17,050
Scott: Your podcast is gonna sound like ass and that's when you know your podcast is so quiet.

385
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,910
Scott: I have to turn the volume of way up in the car and it pisses me off.

386
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:20,231
Rym: Yeah Cuz.

387
00:25:20,251 --> 00:25:22,400
Rym: then you turn it up and you hear all the noise in the background

388
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:32,224
Emily: or you have to be like me and use a Noise-reduction filter and then turn up the vocals and that doesn't necessarily sound like ass But it doesn't sound as good as you wouldn't use a pop filter

389
00:25:32,746 --> 00:25:32,886
Rym: now.

390
00:25:33,007 --> 00:25:40,282
Rym: actually here I'm the only one who actually has a pop filter in front of me Nurse holding the mic about four inches from her face, which is good Scott pretty much.

391
00:25:40,302 --> 00:25:41,567
Rym: She shoves the mic into his mouth.

392
00:25:42,108 --> 00:25:46,009
Scott: Yep That now because I like to lay down and be lazy and all that.

393
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:50,530
Emily: I'm laying down and being lazy too, but I know how to not talk directly in you know towards the mic.

394
00:25:50,871 --> 00:25:53,359
Rym: Now luckily Scott actually isn't that bad about popping.

395
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,182
Rym: I'm real bad.

396
00:25:54,443 --> 00:25:56,490
Rym: just the way I talk and the way I form vowels.

397
00:25:56,611 --> 00:25:57,475
Rym: I pop all the time.

398
00:25:57,536 --> 00:25:58,622
Emily: That's cuz you're a northern hick.

399
00:25:58,964 --> 00:25:59,386
Rym: Yeah quiet.

400
00:25:59,406 --> 00:26:00,130
Rym: You're urban, Michigan.

401
00:26:01,411 --> 00:26:04,302
Rym: Hey get me drunk enough and I'll start speaking like a Michigander again.

402
00:26:04,322 --> 00:26:06,250
Scott: I'm the only civilized person here from Connecticut.

403
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:11,076
Rym: Yeah, New York Yeah, you say you were.

404
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:12,102
Rym: you lived in New York.

405
00:26:12,142 --> 00:26:13,670
Rym: you were there for what a bum.

406
00:26:14,011 --> 00:26:16,741
Scott: I lived in New York between the ages of zero and one.

407
00:26:16,962 --> 00:26:17,283
Rym: Yeah.

408
00:26:17,564 --> 00:26:22,642
Emily: It's like I was born in, Georgia Me saying I'm from Georgia, even though I haven't lived there ever.

409
00:26:22,964 --> 00:26:34,330
Scott: Well, I mean, but like, you know My immediate family lived in Connecticut almost my whole life But like cousins and grandma and all those other people lived in New York and I went there very frequently to see them.

410
00:26:34,531 --> 00:26:35,238
Scott: So it's like it's.

411
00:26:35,258 --> 00:26:41,587
Scott: you know, I'm no stranger Yeah, but anyway, if you if just record yourself lived in New York for the past six seven years.

412
00:26:41,627 --> 00:26:46,763
Rym: Yeah, you have And you even worked in New York City for a while Yep But if you have the kind of voice.

413
00:26:46,783 --> 00:26:47,750
Rym: just record yourself and listen.

414
00:26:48,212 --> 00:26:50,781
Rym: The main thing is you always have to record yourself and listen to yourself.

415
00:26:51,263 --> 00:26:56,130
Rym: if you get embarrassed listening to yourself You're probably not the best person to be doing a podcast.

416
00:26:56,592 --> 00:27:01,870
Scott: Yeah, also remember that if you've never listened to a recording of yourself before you don't sound weird.

417
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:13,204
Scott: You don't sound the way you think you sound because the sound of your voice coming through your skull to your ears is not the way it sounds to other people who have your voice going through the air to their ears.

418
00:27:13,244 --> 00:27:17,562
Rym: your voice sounds a lot deeper and more Awesome in your head than it does in the real world.

419
00:27:17,723 --> 00:27:19,070
Rym: You're gonna get over that fact.

420
00:27:19,411 --> 00:27:22,830
Scott: So when you hear yourself being recorded you hear recording of yourself.

421
00:27:23,171 --> 00:27:25,843
Scott: That's what you sound like to other people whether you know it or not.

422
00:27:25,883 --> 00:27:33,330
Emily: Yeah, there's nothing wrong with your microphone Yep, but you might think it sounds bad But other people are used to your voice and they don't necessarily think it sounds bad.

423
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:36,250
Emily: Just because you think it sounds different than your normal voice doesn't mean it's bad.

424
00:27:36,752 --> 00:27:42,170
Scott: Yeah, I still think that my voice is bad when I hear it recorded, but it sounds great coming in my head.

425
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:51,190
Rym: Yeah now later in the show we can talk more about how to make your voice sound good like really good Because my voice actually sounds quite a bit different in real life than it does in the podcast.

426
00:27:51,311 --> 00:27:52,296
Rym: But I do things to it.

427
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:59,637
Rym: You got to use your $30 an hour voice But anyway to get to what I was talking about with the popping.

428
00:27:59,938 --> 00:28:07,950
Rym: basically if you if you record yourself and you hear a lot of popping going on You can buy what's called a pop filter.

429
00:28:08,594 --> 00:28:12,875
Rym: Now the thing is a pop filter costs like 30 bucks and That's a giant ripoff.

430
00:28:13,216 --> 00:28:20,409
Rym: because in front of my mouth right now is an embroidery loop With a pair of pantyhose stretched over it if you don't know an embroidery loop.

431
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,855
Scott: Embroidery loop good game.

432
00:28:22,915 --> 00:28:25,464
Scott: Yep is this circle of wood?

433
00:28:26,006 --> 00:28:27,030
Rym: Yeah, it's a circle of wood.

434
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:31,510
Rym: I put pantyhose around it and taped it together and I just put it between me and the microphone.

435
00:28:31,992 --> 00:28:34,601
Scott: So my voice it's like a circular cloth shield.

436
00:28:34,983 --> 00:28:37,694
Rym: Yeah, basically your voice if you google for pop filters You'll see pictures.

437
00:28:38,117 --> 00:28:40,070
Rym: now my voice and the audio goes through just fine.

438
00:28:40,451 --> 00:28:44,746
Rym: But when I pop the air bounces off of this filter and doesn't hit the microphone directly.

439
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:45,950
Scott: Well, not as much.

440
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:48,758
Scott: It's not a hundred percent invincible, but it's it's good enough.

441
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:50,684
Rym: Yeah, so listen to yourself.

442
00:28:50,764 --> 00:28:52,770
Rym: And if you need a pop filter, you'll hear it.

443
00:28:52,951 --> 00:28:59,499
Rym: it's pretty obvious because you'll sound like this and People don't like that.

444
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,049
Rym: Yeah, it sounds really bad.

445
00:29:02,912 --> 00:29:04,399
Rym: All right, so you've got a microphone.

446
00:29:04,801 --> 00:29:06,530
Rym: you got to plug it to your computer somehow.

447
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:12,250
Rym: Now Nuri versus Oz do it very different ways because we record very different podcasts near a different budget.

448
00:29:12,371 --> 00:29:13,077
Rym: So I'll let you go first.

449
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:14,066
Rym: How do you connect up?

450
00:29:14,288 --> 00:29:20,310
Emily: All right Well, my microphones don't come with a cable because I got my microphones and my cables from one of my friends for free.

451
00:29:20,973 --> 00:29:30,309
Emily: So I have a microphone and I have a cable that plugs into the bottom of it And then it plugs into either in a mixer or something else on the other end.

452
00:29:30,851 --> 00:29:35,570
Emily: Well, I don't have a mixer because I couldn't find a mixer that could plug into my computer for pretty cheap.

453
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:37,750
Emily: So I just got this little thing.

454
00:29:38,851 --> 00:29:46,456
Emily: it's called a Griffin i-mic and it's just this little tiny round disc that plugs into the USB port on my laptop and Has a headphone input jack.

455
00:29:47,078 --> 00:29:58,399
Emily: So I got a little converter that lets me plug the quarter inch plug from my microphone cable into the eighth inch plug on the Griffin i-mic and I just connect it straight to my computer just like that.

456
00:29:58,579 --> 00:29:59,161
Emily: No mixer.

457
00:29:59,824 --> 00:30:01,530
Emily: No effects on it beforehand or anything.

458
00:30:01,611 --> 00:30:04,230
Emily: I do all of my editing and mixing digitally.

459
00:30:05,391 --> 00:30:07,259
Rym: Now there are both pros and cons to that.

460
00:30:07,721 --> 00:30:09,970
Rym: the pros I imagine are that it doesn't cost much.

461
00:30:10,251 --> 00:30:16,921
Emily: yeah, it's completely free except for the $40 I spent on the i-mic and the $3 I spent on the converter.

462
00:30:17,564 --> 00:30:22,186
Rym: now I could guess at the cons But I'm sure you could fill us in into all the difficulties you have with the setup.

463
00:30:22,649 --> 00:30:26,070
Emily: Yeah Well, um one of my microphone cables doesn't work so well.

464
00:30:26,251 --> 00:30:30,050
Emily: I think it only inputs on the left channel and it doesn't pick up half the audio.

465
00:30:30,271 --> 00:30:35,790
Emily: So all of my signals are really really low and there's something called a signal-to-noise ratio.

466
00:30:36,117 --> 00:30:43,786
Emily: This is key which means that You have a certain amount of audio signal going through your microphone and a certain amount of background noise picked up.

467
00:30:44,248 --> 00:30:50,430
Emily: if your background noise Is really high then your signal-to-noise ratio is really low and you don't like that.

468
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:54,402
Emily: You want it to be really high because you want much more signal than noise.

469
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,208
Emily: so you can cut it all up.

470
00:30:56,449 --> 00:30:56,870
Emily: all the noise.

471
00:30:57,492 --> 00:31:01,322
Scott: Yeah, like the best signal-to-noise ratio is like a hajillion to zero.

472
00:31:01,823 --> 00:31:02,726
Scott: that's the best you can get.

473
00:31:03,167 --> 00:31:11,658
Rym: yeah, I mean basically The more distance there is between your all your voice and the noise the easier It is to get rid of the noise.

474
00:31:12,182 --> 00:31:13,430
Rym: because you can do all that in software.

475
00:31:13,511 --> 00:31:19,750
Rym: You can buy equipment that'll do it But we don't even use equipment to do it because you really don't need that equipment for a podcast.

476
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:35,703
Scott: That's the thing is radio guys as in radio stations that you know broadcast live and such They have all this hardware equipment that you know performs audio operations to the actual Analog signal in real time and we have some of that.

477
00:31:35,903 --> 00:31:37,710
Scott: Yeah, because that's what they need to happen.

478
00:31:37,751 --> 00:31:39,170
Scott: They need it to happen immediately.

479
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:58,586
Scott: So that's why they have dials and levers and switches Because you're making a podcast and you're recording it and then distributing it You can record it onto a file on your computer and do all the stuff that the dials and switches usually do You know after the fact using some piece of software like garage band or resound or something like that.

480
00:31:58,787 --> 00:32:02,079
Rym: now as dirty can probably tell You while that works great for most cases.

481
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,947
Rym: It adds a lot of time to post-production.

482
00:32:04,128 --> 00:32:11,630
Scott: Oh god Yeah, does it add time to post-production but it only works almost as well as the actual dials and switches.

483
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:16,751
Emily: Well, if you listen my podcast, you'll notice it doesn't sound anywhere as good as GeekNights and definitely don't listen to it in your Car.

484
00:32:16,771 --> 00:32:21,550
Rym: Yeah, actually we had a lot of problems before we got a compressor with GeekNights and cars as well.

485
00:32:22,253 --> 00:32:25,687
Rym: one of our friends said that it's unlistenable in a car and sure enough it wasn't.

486
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:28,330
Scott: I Tried to listen to it in the car and it was unlistenable.

487
00:32:28,752 --> 00:32:30,120
Rym: Yeah, but we've since fixed that.

488
00:32:30,502 --> 00:32:31,870
Rym: now our input chain.

489
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:39,619
Rym: We spent I'd say a hundred by eighty about a hundred and twenty bucks on the equipment that is sitting in front of me Between my microphone and the computer.

490
00:32:40,021 --> 00:32:43,816
Emily: you also have a very different kind of computer than I do So why don't you tell them what kind of?

491
00:32:43,876 --> 00:32:53,158
Rym: yeah, so if you don't have a Mac laptop and use have a normal computer you've probably got a sound card and the sound card probably has a Core 8th inch little jack going into it.

492
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:54,423
Scott: It's called the stereo mini.

493
00:32:54,443 --> 00:32:56,210
Scott: That's the normal headphone type plug.

494
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:58,401
Rym: Yeah, anything at most normal headphones your.

495
00:32:58,522 --> 00:33:00,150
Rym: it's the thing you plug into your iPod, whatever.

496
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,134
Scott: Yep, the iPod hole.

497
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,864
Rym: now if you have that you're all set because you can.

498
00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:10,030
Rym: there you go to Radio Shack or whatever You'll see a million adapters and you'll be able to get from whatever your equipment outputs to that jack.

499
00:33:11,071 --> 00:33:14,826
Rym: Now the thing is you don't really want to plug the microphone directly into that.

500
00:33:14,866 --> 00:33:19,850
Rym: if you can help it Even it no matter what no matter how little money you want to spend unless you want to spend no money.

501
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:21,598
Rym: Yeah, we've done.

502
00:33:21,921 --> 00:33:38,030
Scott: there are decent podcasts I listen to that are literally a Logitech headset plugged directly into that hole and as long as you squiddle all your software Meters and all your volume things properly and it'll take you a couple hours It'll sound like the bare minimum of quality.

503
00:33:38,712 --> 00:33:43,370
Rym: Yeah, the main problem with it one is that you can't have guests because you have no way to have them talk.

504
00:33:43,851 --> 00:33:48,330
Scott: Actually, I know a guy who he just gets a Y adapter and plugs in more headsets.

505
00:33:48,571 --> 00:33:53,525
Scott: I could cry and then he brings the volume that it kind of works actually with my podcast.

506
00:33:53,565 --> 00:34:05,528
Emily: We only have one input So we have one microphone and we pass it around between the three of us Which means that we have to do a crapload of post-production because every time we pass the microphone.

507
00:34:05,548 --> 00:34:10,704
Emily: There's a little Sound and that means that we have to go in and cut out every single one of those.

508
00:34:11,225 --> 00:34:18,576
Rym: Oh, oh my god yeah, so our input chain is we have a Eurorack UB 802 mixer.

509
00:34:18,596 --> 00:34:25,331
Scott: we found out about that because the guy who does the Roadhouse podcast, which is awesome blues music Recommended it.

510
00:34:25,734 --> 00:34:26,737
Rym: Yeah, and it's actually very good.

511
00:34:26,757 --> 00:34:28,202
Rym: It was like 60 bucks is fantastic.

512
00:34:28,262 --> 00:34:30,550
Rym: Basically, it's got two now.

513
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:50,679
Rym: This is the reason why this segment of today's podcast might not sound as good as the previous segment before we had Nury in Because this the mixer we have is great, but it has two Pre-amplified microphone inputs meaning I plug my microphone into slot one and Scott's is plugged into slot two and There's an amplifier there before it even hits the rest of the mixer.

514
00:34:51,061 --> 00:34:53,650
Rym: that amplifies the signal from the microphone to a good level.

515
00:34:54,751 --> 00:35:02,650
Rym: Now the rest of the inputs don't have pre amplifiers So I had to turn everything else down so you could actually hear Nury talk because there's no preamp between her and you.

516
00:35:04,171 --> 00:35:06,686
Emily: That's because your mixer sucks and only has two good slots.

517
00:35:07,209 --> 00:35:10,029
Rym: Yeah Well, actually I can buy a little pre amplifier thingy.

518
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:15,190
Rym: Just we haven't gotten around to that yet because this is the first time we've had a guest on the show since we got the compressor.

519
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:20,330
Scott: I told you we should have bought the mixer with four holes, but no that mixer was like $40 more and I was cheap.

520
00:35:20,672 --> 00:35:22,403
Emily: Yeah, you guys don't have guests very often.

521
00:35:22,483 --> 00:35:23,470
Emily: So it's not that big of a deal.

522
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:27,203
Rym: Yeah, most of our guests are going to be with little handheld things at conventions.

523
00:35:27,223 --> 00:35:28,869
Rym: Mm-hmm or over the phone.

524
00:35:29,491 --> 00:35:35,450
Rym: But anyway, then I have a headphone monitor coming out of the mixer so I can listen everyone's voices and set levels before we do.

525
00:35:36,412 --> 00:35:38,321
Rym: But that's not in the signal chain.

526
00:35:38,341 --> 00:35:40,090
Rym: that's kind of like a sidechain to my ears.

527
00:35:40,873 --> 00:35:46,906
Rym: I don't wear it all the time when we talk From there the outputs of the mixer go into what's called a dynamic range compressor.

528
00:35:47,589 --> 00:35:53,910
Rym: now I'm not going to talk about the details of exactly how they work or how to pick one But we're gonna do a show on that someday.

529
00:35:54,393 --> 00:35:57,430
Rym: And if you really want to know just email us and I can send you all this information.

530
00:35:57,992 --> 00:36:07,841
Rym: but basically it takes our audio coming out of the mixer that's raw and It keeps the levels the volumes all about the same.

531
00:36:08,202 --> 00:36:14,881
Rym: so above a certain threshold it decreases the Amplification so that the louder I get in real life.

532
00:36:14,962 --> 00:36:31,128
Rym: It doesn't get quite as loud recording to the computer Which means I can set the in the gain or the input level on the computer a lot higher Which means I'm recording with a lot more data Which means I can do a lot more stuff to the audio without making it sound like ass.

533
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:37,110
Scott: Basically when you get too loud it makes you quiet and when you get too quiet it makes you loud.

534
00:36:37,532 --> 00:36:40,109
Rym: Yeah, basically this one doesn't actually make you louder.

535
00:36:41,251 --> 00:36:42,536
Rym: That's that would be a compander.

536
00:36:42,837 --> 00:36:44,664
Scott: Yeah, but that's that's the general gist of what.

537
00:36:44,725 --> 00:36:49,630
Rym: the yeah, basically if you need It's called a compressor You can do it in software after the fact.

538
00:36:50,052 --> 00:36:56,850
Rym: But compressing is the one thing of all the things you can do after the fact that It really pays to do it before it hits your computer.

539
00:36:56,991 --> 00:37:05,377
Emily: And that's important because when people listen to your show on headphones or in their car Volume jumps are gonna be really They're gonna hurt your ears.

540
00:37:05,558 --> 00:37:09,514
Emily: Even if they're a really small volume jump if you get a little bit louder It's gonna be painful here.

541
00:37:09,715 --> 00:37:11,801
Rym: I I just turned off the compressor.

542
00:37:12,262 --> 00:37:14,609
Rym: So now you're gonna hear the raw audio.

543
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:18,133
Emily: Yay Yay, whoo.

544
00:37:18,716 --> 00:37:20,162
Emily: No, it's awesome.

545
00:37:20,223 --> 00:37:20,886
Emily: I don't like that.

546
00:37:20,946 --> 00:37:21,770
Emily: I'll turn it back on.

547
00:37:22,171 --> 00:37:22,813
Rym: I turned it back on.

548
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:27,028
Rym: the difference might not be so bad because actually I didn't calibrate the mixer the compressor.

549
00:37:27,048 --> 00:37:28,615
Rym: so much Mr.

550
00:37:28,716 --> 00:37:30,230
Scott: I had all the dials perfectly set.

551
00:37:30,471 --> 00:37:32,719
Rym: I have all perfectly set when there's the two of us.

552
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:33,080
Rym: now.

553
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,650
Rym: we got this random elephant of Nury who's laying over there.

554
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:37,828
Emily: Oh, no women messing things up for you again.

555
00:37:40,533 --> 00:37:40,814
Rym: Alright.

556
00:37:40,834 --> 00:37:44,430
Rym: so we realized just now that we could talk about this forever.

557
00:37:45,192 --> 00:37:55,303
Scott: Yeah, I mean if we kept talking and talking eventually like professional radio guys to start calling us and telling us we're wrong or no You had to do this and God they would just be.

558
00:37:55,444 --> 00:38:01,810
Rym: so I promised all of you We'll do a show someday in the future in detail like the specifics of we use a kid this compressor.

559
00:38:01,911 --> 00:38:02,616
Rym: This is how it works.

560
00:38:02,676 --> 00:38:03,402
Rym: This is how you use it.

561
00:38:03,442 --> 00:38:04,409
Rym: This is why you want it, etc.

562
00:38:05,213 --> 00:38:08,910
Rym: But for now, I mean, this is just like a overview of how to not suck a podcast.

563
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:14,304
Scott: Yeah, also there's plenty of other podcasts like infinity podcasts about how to podcast.

564
00:38:14,484 --> 00:38:20,550
Emily: Oh, there's a. there's a Podcasting for dummies book that has a companion podcast.

565
00:38:21,052 --> 00:38:26,349
Emily: so if you can't go out and get the book you can go to the for dummies comm website and download the podcast.

566
00:38:26,369 --> 00:38:35,189
Emily: and It's by T Morris and Evo Tara who are both a couple of podcasters and they've got a lot of experience doing it But it's got a lot of good tips in it.

567
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:37,798
Emily: So go to your local store and check it out.

568
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:38,741
Emily: Even if you don't buy it.

569
00:38:39,002 --> 00:38:39,965
Scott: Oh, no a shill.

570
00:38:40,387 --> 00:38:44,901
Scott: Haha Yeah, there's also what's the other one podcast for one one?

571
00:38:44,941 --> 00:38:47,090
Emily: I think yeah podcast for one one is good.

572
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,921
Emily: They have interviews with podcasters every show.

573
00:38:49,941 --> 00:38:52,010
Rym: Yeah, that's how I learned about a gizmo phone.

574
00:38:52,772 --> 00:38:55,603
Emily: No, you learned about that from me, yeah, I listen to podcast for one.

575
00:38:55,623 --> 00:38:57,590
Rym: Yeah, so indirectly I learned it from them.

576
00:38:58,531 --> 00:39:02,250
Scott: Yeah, so, you know, we're only doing this because we have a lot of you know.

577
00:39:02,451 --> 00:39:14,375
Scott: It seems like every podcast has a pile of listeners who don't know about podcasting and want the one podcast They listen to to tell them, you know instead of going in listening to every other podcast in the world It does the same thing.

578
00:39:14,516 --> 00:39:17,809
Emily: It's surprising how many podcasts there are out there about podcasting.

579
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:23,270
Scott: Imagine if every TV show had to explain television because it was the only TV show that people watch.

580
00:39:23,551 --> 00:39:24,996
Rym: that was a very apt allegory.

581
00:39:25,216 --> 00:39:35,498
Scott: or like every comic book had to explain to you how to read a comic book and how it Works because a lot of the Tokyo pop manga explain it just in case Read it backwards.

582
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,667
Scott: Yeah, but that's you know, it's a one-page deal.

583
00:39:37,687 --> 00:39:39,953
Scott: That's not like an entire Explanation of like.

584
00:39:40,275 --> 00:39:43,970
Scott: here is you put a grammar book in the front of your war and peace, you know.

585
00:39:44,071 --> 00:39:48,753
Rym: The main reason we're doing this is because I'm sorry But a lot of podcasts just are Unlistenable.

586
00:39:48,974 --> 00:39:54,014
Emily: if you want to start a podcast we want you to know these basic things so that we can listen to it without Killing our yeah.

587
00:39:54,135 --> 00:39:57,190
Scott: Yeah, then we can judge you on your content and not on your inept.

588
00:39:57,551 --> 00:40:00,744
Rym: I don't care how good your content is if I can't listen to it.

589
00:40:00,804 --> 00:40:01,808
Emily: It's not gonna get listened to.

590
00:40:01,828 --> 00:40:06,847
Rym: yep No by the same token if you spend a million dollars have awesome equipment, but you're just a guy going.

591
00:40:07,249 --> 00:40:11,821
Emily: so Yeah You You have to have a solid idea.

592
00:40:14,263 --> 00:40:21,202
Emily: Yeah The better your idea is the more crap audio people are willing to put up with but there is still a level where no one's Gonna listen to it.

593
00:40:22,851 --> 00:40:30,030
Rym: Now I guess we can talk a bit about post-production before we end here and by post-production I mean all the stuff you do after you recorded the episode.

594
00:40:30,251 --> 00:40:30,392
Rym: well,

595
00:40:30,432 --> 00:40:37,932
Scott: the first thing you do is you cut it out when someone says stuff like and And Yeah, yep,

596
00:40:39,158 --> 00:40:41,329
Emily: or when you have like a half hour of just laughing

597
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:46,690
Rym: Scott and I actually cut out very little from episodes.

598
00:40:46,891 --> 00:40:50,648
Rym: I like maybe maybe a minutes worth of audio from an entire episode.

599
00:40:50,668 --> 00:40:51,090
Rym: we cut out.

600
00:40:51,531 --> 00:40:53,398
Emily: Ah, but how much did you do back when you started?

601
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:57,942
Rym: when we started we'd cut out like 20 minutes of us Just saying penis at each other.

602
00:41:00,272 --> 00:41:12,833
Rym: Usually the things we cut out are like silence Yeah saying um, or if one of us stopped talking Expecting the other person to chip in but the other person was like not paying attention which doesn't happen so often Except for just now.

603
00:41:13,255 --> 00:41:15,121
Rym: Yeah, just but we're a little.

604
00:41:15,301 --> 00:41:17,870
Rym: we've had a long weekend of geek and we're kind of tired right about now.

605
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:20,097
Scott: Yeah, and I got a busy day at work actually tomorrow.

606
00:41:20,418 --> 00:41:22,465
Rym: Yeah grown, but that's key.

607
00:41:22,626 --> 00:41:28,862
Rym: So it basically It'll take a long time when you first start podcasting no matter how good you are.

608
00:41:29,143 --> 00:41:30,246
Rym: You'll flub over words.

609
00:41:30,266 --> 00:41:33,230
Rym: You'll screw things up You'll you'll cough into the microphone.

610
00:41:33,836 --> 00:41:34,604
Rym: Everyone's looking at me

611
00:41:36,352 --> 00:41:37,416
Scott: Unless you're like who's

612
00:41:37,436 --> 00:41:38,660
Emily: been sick for two weeks.

613
00:41:38,821 --> 00:41:39,925
Rym: Yeah for all of you.

614
00:41:40,005 --> 00:41:44,650
Rym: the week after Katsucon I don't think you all understand how sick I was doing the podcast.

615
00:41:44,911 --> 00:41:54,599
Rym: Well, I was listening to them and I didn't remember saying any of that stuff was Yeah, but anyway now Nuri you do a lot more editing.

616
00:41:55,261 --> 00:41:56,904
Emily: oh, yeah, well I've only done four.

617
00:41:57,626 --> 00:41:59,270
Emily: I'm editing my fifth show right now.

618
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:04,918
Emily: So you guys have done so many more shows than me and we're still working on Building our podcasting habits.

619
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,010
Rym: Yeah, like we've got actually we're getting better about it.

620
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:10,710
Rym: But the first time we had a guest on the show the first couple times.

621
00:42:11,733 --> 00:42:21,039
Rym: I don't know what image you have of us doing GeekNights but I'm sitting with my back to almost everyone talking into a microphone and a pop filter and Staring at my computer and the show notes.

622
00:42:21,502 --> 00:42:22,950
Rym: Scott is laying on his back.

623
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:29,009
Rym: You should take a big time with the microphone like in the air over his mouth and Nuri is kind of lounging on my bed.

624
00:42:29,571 --> 00:42:30,854
Scott: We should go take a soft.

625
00:42:31,195 --> 00:42:32,078
Rym: Yeah, that's awesome.

626
00:42:32,098 --> 00:42:34,405
Rym: My bed was made in like the 1800s the late 1800s, but still I wasn't lying.

627
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:37,037
Emily: That's not important.

628
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,066
Rym: Yeah, it's not at all.

629
00:42:39,772 --> 00:42:42,409
Rym: but and People who we interview or people we have on the show?

630
00:42:42,952 --> 00:42:47,110
Rym: They expect us to be talking to each other because it sounds like we're just two guys standing room talking to each other.

631
00:42:47,472 --> 00:42:48,477
Rym: We're not looking at each other.

632
00:42:48,517 --> 00:42:50,185
Rym: We're not gesturing in any way.

633
00:42:50,205 --> 00:42:51,150
Rym: He's lying.

634
00:42:51,411 --> 00:43:01,582
Scott: Imagine like we're in a TV studio just like yeah, and we have two desks and a whole bunch of couches Between you real fancy microphones and a backdrop that looks like the Hudson River.

635
00:43:01,743 --> 00:43:04,410
Rym: our set looks exactly like The Daily Show.

636
00:43:05,994 --> 00:43:07,306
Scott: In fact, it is The Daily Show.

637
00:43:07,347 --> 00:43:09,395
Rym: Yeah John Stewart.

638
00:43:09,858 --> 00:43:10,903
Rym: Yeah, he's here right now.

639
00:43:11,205 --> 00:43:12,110
Rym: He's sitting in the corner.

640
00:43:13,351 --> 00:43:14,135
Rym: He's making this motion.

641
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:15,139
Rym: Like don't say I'm here.

642
00:43:15,641 --> 00:43:16,966
Rym: I'm supposed to be now.

643
00:43:17,006 --> 00:43:17,508
Rym: he's mad now.

644
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:17,890
Rym: He's gone.

645
00:43:18,733 --> 00:43:19,175
Rym: He left.

646
00:43:19,376 --> 00:43:19,797
Rym: I'm sorry.

647
00:43:19,817 --> 00:43:21,042
Scott: Oh, they're coming.

648
00:43:21,082 --> 00:43:22,930
Scott: I see a cane coming out from behind the curtain.

649
00:43:23,914 --> 00:43:24,747
Scott: It's around my neck.

650
00:43:24,767 --> 00:43:31,189
Scott: see I Thought that'd be funny.

651
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:33,893
Scott: I Don't care you do it everyone.

652
00:43:33,913 --> 00:43:40,967
Rym: All right, see now I'm not gonna cut out what just happened But that's the kind of thing that you can cut out like if someone makes a deadpan joke Nobody laughs.

653
00:43:41,409 --> 00:43:46,668
Rym: Yeah, or it's just not funny dong See if it were for the fact that it probably annoy you I'm can.

654
00:43:46,869 --> 00:43:54,080
Rym: I was considering just now not editing what we just recorded at All so you can hear the raw like rah rah rah podcast.

655
00:43:54,723 --> 00:43:59,357
Rym: however Most of the cuts are just silence between bits as we collect our thoughts.

656
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:00,604
Scott: one day Maybe we should.

657
00:44:00,624 --> 00:44:02,960
Scott: when we do a show we should put up like two posts.

658
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,177
Scott: We should be like post the podcast post special unedited version.

659
00:44:07,538 --> 00:44:07,980
Rym: even better.

660
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:12,478
Rym: We'll post the podcast and then we'll post a stream of all the audio that was cut out.

661
00:44:13,483 --> 00:44:13,947
Scott: They could do that.

662
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:15,580
Rym: That would be good because it's not that much.

663
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,896
Rym: That would be something trivial that I'm sure at least some of you would like to listen to.

664
00:44:18,916 --> 00:44:22,008
Rym: yeah It's mostly obscenities or silence.

665
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:25,580
Emily: Yeah back to the whole communicating with each other thing.

666
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,409
Emily: Communication between the podcasters is really important.

667
00:44:28,429 --> 00:44:30,919
Emily: I mean, I know you guys have kind of interrupting cow moo.

668
00:44:31,261 --> 00:44:38,800
Emily: Yeah, you guys have kind of How to talk to each other even when you're not looking at each other, but for my podcast we have one microphone.

669
00:44:39,163 --> 00:44:46,479
Emily: We're in a triangle staring at each other And if we want to say something we have to like stare at the person who's got the mic and hold out our hand.

670
00:44:48,601 --> 00:44:51,349
Rym: That stuff I mean a lot of podcasters is one guy.

671
00:44:51,369 --> 00:44:54,839
Rym: the more people you have the harder it is be ready for that.

672
00:44:55,642 --> 00:44:59,356
Scott: Yeah, one guy or one girl is the easiest podcast in the universe.

673
00:44:59,376 --> 00:45:07,358
Rym: Yes, two is okay But it took Scott and I about 20 episodes to get down where we don't keep interrupting each other or where one of us will stop talking.

674
00:45:07,398 --> 00:45:08,282
Rym: the other one doesn't pick Up.

675
00:45:08,808 --> 00:45:09,980
Scott: Yeah, I don't even really think about it.

676
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:20,920
Rym: It's just kind of like, you know I just do the well for anyone doesn't know us when the podcast stops We just keep talking almost exactly the way we're talking now For the next several hours without a microphone in front of our faces.

677
00:45:21,241 --> 00:45:26,640
Rym: Yeah, we could pretty much we could do a 24-hour show if you really wanted and it would be mostly interesting.

678
00:45:28,042 --> 00:45:29,808
Emily: It would be mostly Scott playing video games.

679
00:45:30,109 --> 00:45:30,991
Rym: Yeah, or so.

680
00:45:31,032 --> 00:45:32,456
Scott: I don't play that many video games.

681
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:35,460
Scott: usually just because you people are here I can't actually do any work on my computer.

682
00:45:35,801 --> 00:45:40,399
Scott: So instead you play video games exactly because then at least someone will be entertained by watching the video game.

683
00:45:41,803 --> 00:45:43,653
Scott: And you can't tell me you don't like watching video games.

684
00:45:43,733 --> 00:45:49,095
Rym: in addition to editing, you know Like actually cutting things out you have to do some sort of post-production filtering.

685
00:45:49,979 --> 00:45:50,240
Rym: I don't know.

686
00:45:50,561 --> 00:45:52,012
Emily: Yeah, you don't have to.

687
00:45:52,113 --> 00:45:57,800
Rym: you should Very simply very briefly a noise gate.

688
00:45:58,503 --> 00:46:07,960
Rym: All it does is you can say any noise below a certain volume Where this this noise or this volume lasts for a certain amount of time will be cut out entirely.

689
00:46:08,762 --> 00:46:18,937
Rym: That can cut out like breathing noises between when anyone's talking or static from your mixer or Anything like that any background noise me bumping into the microphone.

690
00:46:19,339 --> 00:46:19,399
Rym: Oh

691
00:46:20,423 --> 00:46:21,105
Scott: The problem is

692
00:46:21,687 --> 00:46:21,767
Rym: if

693
00:46:21,787 --> 00:46:35,377
Scott: you don't if you turn it up too high or if you have too much noise you'll end up either cutting out all the noise and some of your voice or You know not enough of the noise and it's really tough unless you have really behaved.

694
00:46:35,437 --> 00:46:36,240
Scott: well-behaved noise.

695
00:46:36,644 --> 00:46:37,977
Rym: Yeah now well-behaved.

696
00:46:39,081 --> 00:46:49,077
Rym: There some people get good at like the DJ voice or the radio voice and they can talk at a fairly Constant volume at around a regular at a regular rate and they hold the microphone said distance from their mouth.

697
00:46:49,318 --> 00:46:51,082
Scott: Hey everybody It's Saturday.

698
00:46:51,664 --> 00:46:52,949
Rym: A lot of people can't do that.

699
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:55,980
Rym: So the other thing you can do is called compression.

700
00:46:57,061 --> 00:46:59,574
Rym: Now I talked about compression already with the hardware.

701
00:46:59,614 --> 00:47:00,800
Rym: You can also do it in software.

702
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:06,982
Rym: I highly recommend that you do some form of compression on your podcast Software.

703
00:47:07,002 --> 00:47:09,228
Emily: do you use to do software?

704
00:47:09,529 --> 00:47:13,600
Rym: Well, I use resound which I find to be absolutely fantastic.

705
00:47:13,823 --> 00:47:22,787
Rym: But if you're a Linux awesome Yeah It's only for Linux and you might have some trouble getting it to work a hundred percent if you use any sort of Good distro except Ubuntu.

706
00:47:22,847 --> 00:47:23,771
Rym: It just works in Ubuntu.

707
00:47:24,052 --> 00:47:26,120
Scott: Yep, you can use garage band.

708
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,532
Scott: I know garage band has a very nice compression.

709
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:31,807
Rym: Yeah, if you have a bag and your lead Yeah, and you can figure it out.

710
00:47:31,908 --> 00:47:39,798
Emily: cuz I've got garage band and I don't know I don't have the garage band version that supports the make a podcast.

711
00:47:40,019 --> 00:47:43,456
Scott: Oh, yeah The real newest garage band has the podcasting stuff in it.

712
00:47:43,476 --> 00:47:44,139
Scott: So that's nice.

713
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:44,621
Emily: It'll.

714
00:47:44,702 --> 00:47:48,719
Emily: it'll actually do the noise gate while you're recording and it does like pops and stuff.

715
00:47:49,621 --> 00:47:52,179
Rym: That's a real-time audio is a pain in the ass in Linux.

716
00:47:53,261 --> 00:47:58,199
Rym: but the thing is most real-time filters don't help much because you can do them just as easily after the fact.

717
00:47:58,219 --> 00:48:04,080
Rym: and The clipping is the limiting factor in recording and your sound card can't do anything about clipping.

718
00:48:05,223 --> 00:48:07,380
Rym: That all has to be done with hardware before it hits the computer.

719
00:48:07,661 --> 00:48:14,552
Scott: Yep, the most popular podcast software seems to either be audacity Which is for all so all operating which actually we also use.

720
00:48:14,572 --> 00:48:16,760
Rym: we use both resound and audacity for different purposes.

721
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:24,460
Emily: Audacity is the free provided software online and all the podcast directories like podcast alley linked to it.

722
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,080
Rym: Yep, it's just a multitrack editors.

723
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,679
Rym: You can line up all your tracks and just export and it has compressors and stuff in it.

724
00:48:30,262 --> 00:48:34,300
Scott: The other thing a lot of people use I don't know I don't think it's a hundred percent free is cast blaster.

725
00:48:34,923 --> 00:48:45,773
Scott: cast blaster is like the one-stop shop for podcasting like it does everything from beginning to end from Recording to uploading to your website and making the post and the show notes.

726
00:48:45,893 --> 00:48:46,896
Rym: now, isn't it Windows only?

727
00:48:47,197 --> 00:48:49,379
Scott: it is Windows only Which is why we do not use it.

728
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:56,123
Rym: Yeah Then we're thinking about using it for like conventions where we won't have all our equipment with us or we won't have like my computer With us.

729
00:48:56,405 --> 00:48:56,908
Scott: Yeah, we'll see.

730
00:48:56,989 --> 00:49:02,480
Scott: it has one nice thing about cast blaster Buttons and you can assign like audio files to the buttons.

731
00:49:03,002 --> 00:49:07,119
Scott: So let's say you have a button with a funny jingle on it like Rym doesn't give a shit.

732
00:49:07,781 --> 00:49:15,848
Scott: Well while you're recording you just push the Rym doesn't give a shit button and it'll play that instead of having to add in Rym Doesn't give a shit after you're done recording.

733
00:49:16,089 --> 00:49:17,996
Rym: Yeah, you can also do that with compressors.

734
00:49:18,317 --> 00:49:19,180
Rym: It's called auto ducking.

735
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,586
Rym: I'm not gonna get into that now.

736
00:49:20,626 --> 00:49:23,659
Rym: That's well beyond what you need to know well beyond.

737
00:49:24,402 --> 00:49:30,679
Emily: Yeah, if you want to go the extra step and buy a program that's a little bit higher quality than those there's a program called.

738
00:49:31,083 --> 00:49:31,493
Emily: What is it?

739
00:49:32,243 --> 00:49:33,099
Emily: Adobe Audition.

740
00:49:33,492 --> 00:49:34,824
Emily: Yeah Windows machines.

741
00:49:34,904 --> 00:49:39,080
Rym: now Adobe Audition is actually mostly this other program called cool edit.

742
00:49:39,864 --> 00:49:42,800
Rym: If you can find a copy of cool edit for Windows use it use it use it.

743
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,907
Rym: It's fantastic don't use it does?

744
00:49:45,168 --> 00:49:47,115
Rym: Adobe bought it and raped the shell.

745
00:49:47,155 --> 00:49:48,420
Rym: That was that program.

746
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,694
Emily: Yeah, they probably charge a heck of a lot more for it, too.

747
00:49:51,077 --> 00:49:55,160
Scott: Yeah But whatever Sony also makes a program.

748
00:49:56,282 --> 00:49:59,997
Emily: I think it's called sound Forge, but it's pretty much the equivalent of the Adobe one.

749
00:50:00,017 --> 00:50:03,029
Rym: Oh I've used that in that audio class.

750
00:50:03,089 --> 00:50:05,077
Rym: I took with katsu at RIT wasn't there?

751
00:50:05,097 --> 00:50:05,679
Scott: Pro Tools?

752
00:50:07,301 --> 00:50:09,869
Rym: Is well beyond what you need to do a pod.

753
00:50:09,929 --> 00:50:12,798
Emily: Pro Tools is what professional recording studios use.

754
00:50:13,019 --> 00:50:16,207
Scott: yeah But you can use it and it'll work If you want.

755
00:50:16,227 --> 00:50:21,875
Rym: yeah if you have money Buy a firewire mixer and a Mac and Pro Tools and it'll do.

756
00:50:21,895 --> 00:50:22,899
Rym: is about everything you need.

757
00:50:23,362 --> 00:50:25,455
Scott: Sony also makes some sort of Windows software.

758
00:50:25,475 --> 00:50:35,081
Rym: I don't know what it's called now a noise gate compression and The main thing here is normalization Even if you don't do anything else Normalize.

759
00:50:35,563 --> 00:50:40,440
Rym: if the first half of your podcast is real loud the second half is quiet or every day is a different volume.

760
00:50:40,602 --> 00:50:41,655
Rym: It's just gonna piss me off.

761
00:50:42,181 --> 00:50:50,420
Scott: Yep, normalizing will at least make sure that the volume is Somewhat the same throughout, you know from day to day from minute to minute.

762
00:50:50,641 --> 00:50:54,820
Emily: So what's the difference in your waveform before you normalize and after you normalize?

763
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:59,920
Rym: Well, it depends on whether or not you do dynamic normalization now basically a normal normalizer.

764
00:51:00,342 --> 00:51:02,149
Rym: That sounded really dumb a normal normalizer.

765
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:04,640
Scott: Anyway, the standard basic normal.

766
00:51:04,821 --> 00:51:15,020
Rym: all it'll do is it'll find the loudest point in your podcast and Amplify everything in your podcast until that loudest point is as loud as a wave file can make something loud.

767
00:51:15,504 --> 00:51:16,211
Rym: that's all it'll do.

768
00:51:16,232 --> 00:51:22,540
Rym: a Dynamic one will go through your podcast and amplify different parts by different amounts to make everything louder.

769
00:51:22,941 --> 00:51:26,654
Rym: But make things that are already loud stay the current loudness and not get louder.

770
00:51:26,955 --> 00:51:29,024
Rym: to use the word loud a lot of times in one sentence.

771
00:51:29,045 --> 00:51:32,500
Scott: I Can't think of another word for loud right now.

772
00:51:34,663 --> 00:51:37,330
Rym: Loud Painful.

773
00:51:41,842 --> 00:51:42,687
Rym: Now what I do.

774
00:51:42,788 --> 00:51:44,620
Rym: just a lot of podcasts seem to do this lately.

775
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:49,486
Rym: But basically you want your podcast to be as loud as possible Not as quiet as possible.

776
00:51:49,867 --> 00:51:53,660
Rym: the standard generally in terms of audio on the internet is make it loud.

777
00:51:54,441 --> 00:52:11,419
Scott: Yeah, well the thing is is if you make it quiet that means that you know If you want people to be able to hear it They have to make it loud on their end using their stereo their iPod Whatever and if they do that what happens is all the really bad parts of the audio like the hissing and whatnot.

778
00:52:12,002 --> 00:52:18,539
Rym: Get louder also When and it's just bad you want to do as much that you can to the audio before they get to it.

779
00:52:18,579 --> 00:52:19,708
Rym: that way They don't have to do much.

780
00:52:19,729 --> 00:52:20,274
Scott: Mm-hmm.

781
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:24,650
Rym: Now in audacity a lot of podcasters seem to use the standard of.

782
00:52:25,031 --> 00:52:28,060
Rym: they'll normalize to negative point two decibels.

783
00:52:28,983 --> 00:52:30,649
Rym: If you don't know what that means, don't worry about it.

784
00:52:31,071 --> 00:52:33,580
Rym: if you normalize or amplified send it to that.

785
00:52:34,008 --> 00:52:35,961
Rym: It's a nice Baseline.

786
00:52:36,342 --> 00:52:39,633
Emily: if you the default in audacity is that normalizes to zero?

787
00:52:39,653 --> 00:52:41,800
Rym: Yeah, I do it to negative point two.

788
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,570
Rym: I've seen a lot of people do that there.

789
00:52:43,651 --> 00:52:45,139
Rym: There's almost no difference between the two.

790
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:56,018
Emily: Well, it's negative point two indeed As opposed to zero which is uh, I'm just saying if you want to use zero If you want to use audacity, you're gonna have to set that.

791
00:52:56,581 --> 00:53:01,820
Rym: Yeah, one thing you can do is just Google around online and look at what other podcasters do in terms of their settings.

792
00:53:02,323 --> 00:53:09,420
Rym: But keep in mind that if they say specific numbers They're not gonna help you much in a lot of cases because your levels are probably a lot different from their levels.

793
00:53:09,881 --> 00:53:17,540
Scott: Yeah, when people are talking about specific numbers in their settings, that's pretty much like a case-by-case basis eight six, seven five three.

794
00:53:17,741 --> 00:53:20,774
Emily: Oh, yeah, that is not Rym's phone number.

795
00:53:20,835 --> 00:53:26,352
Scott: Do not call that If anyone if anyone doesn't know what that is, you're all.

796
00:53:26,372 --> 00:53:28,780
Scott: you're going on the uncool list along with the rest of the people.

797
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:31,035
Rym: How about just born after the 80s?

798
00:53:33,481 --> 00:53:35,348
Rym: No, actually if you call it, I'm not gonna give.

799
00:53:35,408 --> 00:53:38,520
Scott: I don't know that it sounded to me like you just said uncool.

800
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:47,950
Rym: Now I'm not gonna give you my phone number But for all of since you know My phone was lost and that cool guy is sending it to me.

801
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:55,979
Rym: if you call if someone knows my phone number and calls it Some FedEx guy is gonna have a loud cell phone ringtone going off in his in the back of his truck.

802
00:53:59,016 --> 00:54:01,720
Rym: I Swear to God if my phone gets blown up because they think it's a bomb.

803
00:54:02,762 --> 00:54:04,360
Scott: Dude, I'm totally calling it tomorrow.

804
00:54:08,282 --> 00:54:10,615
Rym: All right, so we're basically done here.

805
00:54:10,655 --> 00:54:11,479
Rym: we've gone long enough.

806
00:54:12,263 --> 00:54:17,164
Rym: If your podcast sucks make it not suck and if you have a question we have for like.

807
00:54:17,184 --> 00:54:27,680
Rym: seriously if you have a question about how to do podcasts email us or post in the forums or Find Nuri's podcast which will link to and I ask her because that we all know a lot about this stuff.

808
00:54:28,102 --> 00:54:34,589
Rym: And if you have a specific question, we can answer it in fairly deep detail Because he sits at work all day and does nothing.

809
00:54:35,171 --> 00:54:37,180
Scott: quite you, you know, who else can answer the question?

810
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:39,831
Scott: Google Google can answer the question.

811
00:54:40,434 --> 00:54:41,320
Rym: Yeah, they'll be wary.

812
00:54:41,501 --> 00:54:48,413
Rym: I've seen a lot of podcasters that have a site on how to do a podcast But they don't know what they're talking about and they're just they're making shit up.

813
00:54:49,156 --> 00:54:50,100
Scott: Well, they're not making it up.

814
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:54,200
Scott: They're just you know, they think they're doing good when they're not doing so good because they're not informed.

815
00:54:54,581 --> 00:55:09,325
Scott: Yeah, it's like that guy who pretends he knows that he's talking about Samir Gupta Rym Samir Show on Samir Gupta someday and Roland pika-pam Roland peak Paley Whatever his name is.

816
00:55:09,385 --> 00:55:10,330
Rym: I don't know how to pronounce it.

817
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:11,073
Scott: I don't either.

818
00:55:11,335 --> 00:55:12,400
Emily: Yeah, it's not that hard though.

819
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:20,757
Emily: I mean you search on Google for how to make a podcast And you should be able to tell pretty quickly which sites are good which says aren't two sites that say the same thing You're on the right track.

820
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:23,189
Scott: Yeah As long as one didn't copy from the other.

821
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:28,200
Scott: another good way to tell is if a guy says something Listen to his podcast and see what it sounds like.

822
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:38,795
Rym: Yeah, if he tells you how to do a podcast and his podcast sounds like to say what I've been saying all night Yeah, what you could also do is go around listening to podcasts and find one.

823
00:55:38,956 --> 00:55:48,777
Scott: find ones that you know look good and seem like they spent the same amount of money you're gonna spend and See if they have an episode about how they do it because a lot of them do.

824
00:55:48,857 --> 00:55:51,990
Scott: I'd say about 75% of podcasts have an episode about how they do it.

825
00:55:52,151 --> 00:55:56,831
Rym: and if you're gonna spend about $100 ask us Because I think our podcast sounds really good.

826
00:55:57,173 --> 00:55:58,599
Emily: Hey, maybe you guys should have a.

827
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:05,460
Rym: Yeah, yeah, because you know everyone in the frickin world keeps asking us to do a show on it to do a post on it.

828
00:56:05,621 --> 00:56:09,329
Rym: Yeah, so God doesn't want to do it Because everyone else freaking does it.

829
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:16,905
Emily: that you know, I know another podcast But your podcast sounds better than most of the other podcasts out there that I listen to and I listen to a shitload of Podcasts.

830
00:56:17,187 --> 00:56:19,260
Rym: Yeah, so I think we should do a public service to the world.

831
00:56:20,562 --> 00:56:22,155
Rym: All right, all right anyway.

832
00:56:22,478 --> 00:56:25,777
Rym: once again I apologize if the second half of the show doesn't sound as good as you're used to.

833
00:56:25,797 --> 00:56:28,233
Scott: you know The part we talked about how to make it sound good.

834
00:56:28,816 --> 00:56:32,180
Rym: Yeah part Once I'm gonna buy another pre amplifier.

835
00:56:32,361 --> 00:56:35,699
Rym: So when we have guests on the show, we can actually use the mixer the way we're supposed to.

836
00:56:36,021 --> 00:56:37,471
Emily: Yeah, invite me back when that happens.

837
00:56:38,095 --> 00:56:42,902
Scott: Yeah You Roy Jenkins See.

838
00:56:42,922 --> 00:57:00,139
Rym: now this is the part that we cut off at the end of the show or just play the music And That was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

839
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:02,264
