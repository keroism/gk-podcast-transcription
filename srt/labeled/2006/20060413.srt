1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,287
Rym: It's Thursday April 13th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:12,609 --> 00:00:20,055
Rym: tonight We deviate from the GeekNights standard course affair and bring you a somewhat explicit and possibly interesting episode Tonight.

3
00:00:20,336 --> 00:00:22,530
Rym: GeekNights is going to discuss masturbation.

4
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,195
Rym: Let's do this Well tonight again.

5
00:00:26,215 --> 00:00:29,270
Rym: I am here alone though Scott will be joining me for the second half of the episode.

6
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:33,029
Rym: I will be doing the news anything of the day as I tend to do when Scott is not here.

7
00:00:33,952 --> 00:00:42,379
Rym: Now first off I would like to say again because while GeekNights is not an explicit or Particularly are or whatever rated podcast.

8
00:00:43,262 --> 00:00:57,263
Rym: I feel it is my duty to inform our listeners that tonight we are talking about a somewhat delicate topic and If you feel for whatever reason that you should not be listening to it Then I suggest that you do not listen to tonight's episode tonight.

9
00:00:57,303 --> 00:00:59,290
Rym: We are going to be discussing masturbation.

10
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:18,130
Rym: Now While it is my personal feeling that this is a somewhat silly topic for anyone to get bothered about or uptight or whatever There are laws in some of the more restrictive countries in this world such as the United States barring Certain people from listening to certain types of media describing certain types of things.

11
00:01:18,731 --> 00:01:31,783
Rym: Thus all I will say before we continue with the show is that quite simply if you are living somewhere in the United States Where you will violate United States law by listening to this episode Then I urge you to not listen and to not violate any laws.

12
00:01:32,204 --> 00:01:36,540
Rym: if you live outside of the United States I could care less what you do because your laws don't apply to me.

13
00:01:37,182 --> 00:01:38,527
Rym: But anyway more on that later.

14
00:01:38,587 --> 00:01:39,390
Rym: first in the news.

15
00:01:40,612 --> 00:01:48,583
Rym: I don't know how many of you are aware of this but the internet is subject to the same tax laws that the rest of the world is now.

16
00:01:48,623 --> 00:01:53,649
Rym: a lot of people buy things online and They're usually pleased when they don't have to pay any sales tax on it.

17
00:01:54,211 --> 00:02:01,005
Rym: Or sometimes I know people get miffed when they order something and for some reason that retailer seems to charge them sales tax Even though no one else does.

18
00:02:02,193 --> 00:02:10,067
Rym: Now the IRS has the right to collect sales taxes on anything sold online not just online actually but anywhere.

19
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:20,669
Rym: and The issue here is simply that due to a lot of complicated laws that I'm not going to get into Most online retailers do not charge sales tax at all.

20
00:02:21,673 --> 00:02:25,830
Rym: This is because they cannot deal with the fact that every state has different sales tax laws.

21
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:29,540
Rym: some states have no sales tax at all and some two states it shit.

22
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:58,510
Rym: it varies as low as by county or by city and the basic rule is simply that if you order something online or purchase something from a cut from a company that Does not have a significant presence or any sort of base of operations in your state Then that company is not obligated to in any way collect sales taxes from you And in fact you are obligated to report and pay those taxes to your state under what is called a use tax.

23
00:02:59,553 --> 00:03:07,949
Rym: Now many people ignore these taxes But they're actually fairly widespread and you can get into just as much trouble by not paying them as you can by not paying your other taxes.

24
00:03:08,851 --> 00:03:21,711
Rym: Anytime you purchase something outside of your state Anything that you will ever use in your state take into your state or enjoy the benefits from in your state You have to pay a use tax on it because your state didn't get its cut of the sales tax that you would have paid On it.

25
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:23,638
Rym: It's kind of a low thing.

26
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:26,910
Rym: I very much disagree with a lot of it, but there's nothing you can do.

27
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:34,768
Rym: that's the law and The news here is simply that the IRS is starting to really go after people who don't pay now.

28
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,297
Rym: This isn't really news.

29
00:03:36,418 --> 00:03:37,850
Rym: This has been going on for a long time.

30
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,070
Rym: There's always been a lot of controversy about sales tax on the internet and whatnot.

31
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:47,710
Rym: The news now is that many of the states which are experiencing some budget shortfalls or are in other ways strapped for cash.

32
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:55,510
Rym: I've decided that this is a nice untapped revenue stream and they're going to start enforcing use taxes as as fully as they can.

33
00:03:56,614 --> 00:03:57,488
Rym: Now, what does it mean to you?

34
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:07,862
Rym: It means that if you get audited the IRS can require your bank statements and credit card statements and can look through them for any Purchases you may have made out of state or out of your county.

35
00:04:08,745 --> 00:04:20,310
Rym: and if you were caught Having bought something in another state or another county or on the internet and having not paid the proper use tax on it You can be screwed just as much as if you cheated anywhere else on your taxes.

36
00:04:21,173 --> 00:04:29,047
Rym: the states are really starting to crack down or at least they say they're starting to crack down and Here is the interesting part that at least I've noticed.

37
00:04:29,912 --> 00:04:38,991
Rym: Whenever states crack down on this because states have cracked down on the use taxes once or twice in the past it seems that one they go over after businesses more than people and Two.

38
00:04:39,493 --> 00:04:49,646
Rym: while they won't go after many people directly or obviously they will make a huge public media debacle scandal whatever they'll put all the word out that hey, we're coming after you.

39
00:04:49,686 --> 00:04:50,589
Rym: you'd better come clean.

40
00:04:50,609 --> 00:05:10,988
Rym: and I really believe that the rationale here is simply that if they tell everyone that they're going to enforce it strictly and they tell Everyone that they're going to go after them then people might be more likely to just pay the tax or pay the Recommended minimum use tax in order to avoid being caught or get in trouble Despite the fact that if they just kept their mouth shut they probably wouldn't get caught.

41
00:05:11,991 --> 00:05:15,410
Rym: Now I cannot legally give you tax advice for a number of reasons.

42
00:05:15,933 --> 00:05:18,549
Rym: All I will say is that I have not paid any use taxes.

43
00:05:19,212 --> 00:05:30,090
Rym: However, I will also say that I did not last year purchase anything in any sort of very Verifiable way from any state other than New York or from any County other than the county in which I live.

44
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:47,949
Rym: ha ha Now in some more fun news South Park, which is a show that I like and I've respected more and more over time Has gotten in trouble with Comedy Central yet again And in fact Comedy Central has seen fit to censor them and prevent them from showing part of an episode that they made.

45
00:05:48,952 --> 00:05:54,310
Rym: I'm sure you're all familiar with the Muhammad image scandal where a Danish newspaper printed a few images of Muhammad.

46
00:05:55,192 --> 00:06:01,424
Rym: now to many followers or adherents of Islam an Image of any kind of Muhammad is a terrible graven whatnot?

47
00:06:01,765 --> 00:06:03,110
Rym: and it is something that cannot be done.

48
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:12,130
Rym: it is a sin to do so to have it to draw it to show it and A Danish newspaper printed a number of these characters and there was worldwide uproar.

49
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:25,253
Rym: now South Park decided that they were going to do a nice spoof on this and the episode includes all sorts of nice funny Censorship themes and it gets to a point where they're going to show an image of Muhammad instead of showing it.

50
00:06:25,534 --> 00:06:31,960
Rym: the episode was forced to show some black text saying that Comedy Central had prevented them from showing the part of the episode they plan to show.

51
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:38,367
Rym: and While technically Comedy Central is perfectly within their rights to censor an episode.

52
00:06:38,387 --> 00:06:39,170
Rym: I mean, it's their network.

53
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,254
Rym: They can do whatever they want.

54
00:06:40,515 --> 00:06:43,706
Rym: They claim that their rationale was for the good of public safety or something stupid.

55
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:53,690
Rym: I Think this is a very cowardly act on their part and that freedom of speech should always supersede When at all possible any other interests.

56
00:06:55,091 --> 00:07:02,474
Rym: now the really interesting part and I only bring this up because a few nights ago Scott and I happened to watch the episode involved.

57
00:07:02,896 --> 00:07:13,350
Rym: but almost four or five seasons ago South Park actually had Muhammad not only as an image but as a central character in one of their episodes the super best friends episode.

58
00:07:13,792 --> 00:07:21,069
Rym: That actually includes the giant Abraham Lincoln who was then killed by the giant stone John Wilkes booth that we talked about in the forums a little while ago.

59
00:07:22,171 --> 00:07:26,610
Rym: So in fact South Park has already shown images of Muhammad and Comedy Central did nothing.

60
00:07:27,336 --> 00:07:38,505
Rym: so I guess it says a lot about the Climate of the world and the tension that's around now that something that was just common and funny and no one even made a remark About it five years ago is suddenly this horrible life or death.

61
00:07:38,766 --> 00:07:39,590
Rym: We must censor it.

62
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:45,370
Rym: We must deprive you of your free speech issue And frankly, I've just lost a lot of respect for the executives at Comedy Central who made this decision.

63
00:07:52,173 --> 00:08:06,490
Rym: So my thing of the day I don't know how old this is, but I discovered it on the internet very recently It is a story written in the style of HP Lovecraft of Cthulhu fame But it is not about Cthulhu or demons or anything.

64
00:08:06,951 --> 00:08:12,450
Rym: It is a story that is written about a baby and a man who is supposed to change this baby's diaper.

65
00:08:13,172 --> 00:08:27,843
Rym: But as it is written in this Cthulhu type style, it's rather creepy and disturbing Especially if you don't actually realize what the story is about now Once again, I don't know how old this is But I noticed it today and I read it and I found it absolutely hilarious.

66
00:08:28,585 --> 00:08:40,950
Rym: and I do know that a long time ago I found a website that had a whole bunch of stories written about mundane things or about things you wouldn't expect But they were written from the style or the perspective of a famous author.

67
00:08:41,432 --> 00:08:45,150
Rym: Someone wrote one about changing a light bulb, but it was hemming away and all sorts of funny things.

68
00:08:45,612 --> 00:08:46,978
Rym: I don't know if this was part of that or not.

69
00:08:46,998 --> 00:08:49,470
Rym: I don't remember where that was, but I found this funny.

70
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:56,370
Rym: So without further ado, I now present the much awaited and much maligned GeekNights episode on masturbation.

71
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:03,867
Rym: I give one final caution that if you are in any way averse to explicit or sexual content I recommend you stop listening right now.

72
00:09:04,592 --> 00:09:08,108
Rym: now there's been a lot of hype for today's episode.

73
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:16,230
Rym: a Lot of people have been bothering us about it talking it up various things And there are also a number of terms for what we are about to discuss

74
00:09:17,236 --> 00:09:19,649
Scott: such as Fondle the fig

75
00:09:20,277 --> 00:09:21,227
Rym: Dragon the dragon

76
00:09:22,632 --> 00:09:23,318
Scott: Paddle the pickle

77
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,528
Rym: spanking the monkey

78
00:09:25,572 --> 00:09:26,534
Scott: Shoot putty at the moon

79
00:09:26,975 --> 00:09:27,737
Rym: choking the chicken

80
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,903
Scott: shaking hands with the unemployed

81
00:09:30,223 --> 00:09:32,649
Rym: beating off jerking off stroking off

82
00:09:33,275 --> 00:09:34,125
Scott: mangling the midget

83
00:09:35,353 --> 00:09:37,800
Rym: Night on the town with Pamela Anderson and her five friends

84
00:09:38,382 --> 00:09:39,445
Scott: waxing the dolphin

85
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:40,669
Rym: verbing the noun

86
00:09:41,975 --> 00:09:42,869
Scott: snap the monkey.

87
00:09:44,295 --> 00:09:51,890
Scott: tonight we're going to talk about Masturbation and if we were really cool, we could go the rest of the episode with using a different euphemism every time.

88
00:09:51,971 --> 00:09:52,768
Scott: But we're not that cool.

89
00:09:53,110 --> 00:10:01,874
Rym: Yeah, considering that googling around for masturbation euphemism gave us enough comedy fodder to last the rest of time Bludgeoning the beefsteak.

90
00:10:02,114 --> 00:10:03,559
Scott: Yeah, we would be able to do that.

91
00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:03,780
Scott: Yeah.

92
00:10:04,482 --> 00:10:07,010
Scott: So anyway, in fact, there's a Star Wars list.

93
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:11,264
Scott: It's like 15 Star Wars euphemisms for masturbation.

94
00:10:11,284 --> 00:10:16,603
Scott: You wouldn't think there'd be that many Yeah, but until you've groomed the Wookie, you know, you don't really know.

95
00:10:17,386 --> 00:10:18,550
Scott: yeah, all right.

96
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:27,564
Rym: So last week near the end of a fairly long episode we ended up deciding on the air that we were going to talk this week about masturbation.

97
00:10:28,306 --> 00:10:31,215
Rym: and the day has come and We're not ones to.

98
00:10:31,436 --> 00:10:33,284
Rym: um, as we've said before shit talk.

99
00:10:33,665 --> 00:10:34,147
Rym: So here we are.

100
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:42,148
Scott: Let's start by saying that we are experts Masters if you will.

101
00:10:42,631 --> 00:10:58,437
Scott: yeah, if you think that we're professionals and we know everything we're talking about when it comes to like how a computer works and what To buy we are double experts when it comes to this now Like relatives and things aren't listening.

102
00:10:58,578 --> 00:10:59,621
Rym: Oh, I know they all are.

103
00:10:59,882 --> 00:11:01,929
Rym: I'm sure this episode is gonna come back to bite us.

104
00:11:02,613 --> 00:11:03,016
Scott: Awesome.

105
00:11:03,137 --> 00:11:03,277
Rym: Now.

106
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:05,210
Rym: I just like to say my grandma doesn't listen.

107
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:15,301
Rym: I would like to say to anyone out there that one if you've just tuned in to GeekNights for the first time ever I'm sorry, you picked the wrong day.

108
00:11:15,361 --> 00:11:16,364
Scott: We have archives.

109
00:11:16,404 --> 00:11:18,130
Scott: You can listen to old episodes first.

110
00:11:18,531 --> 00:11:25,690
Rym: Yeah, this is a special episode and that one we said we'd do it and now we're held to doing it too.

111
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:34,482
Scott: This is probably the first and only I guess explicit GeekNights ever To figure out how to put the tag on just this episode somehow.

112
00:11:34,723 --> 00:11:36,450
Rym: Yeah, this episode will be marked separately.

113
00:11:37,151 --> 00:11:47,250
Rym: Yeah, I mean we we generally are somewhat foul-mouthed and such but this is a fairly Delicate or touchy if you will topic for many people at least for Americans.

114
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:51,187
Rym: Yeah, if you live outside of America, whatever nothing we're gonna say is new.

115
00:11:51,448 --> 00:11:54,724
Scott: Yeah so let's start at the beginning.

116
00:11:54,785 --> 00:11:57,696
Scott: when it comes to Draining the dragon.

117
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:58,098
Rym: All right.

118
00:11:58,138 --> 00:12:02,717
Rym: Now we're not going to go into a long Socio-economical whatnot?

119
00:12:02,797 --> 00:12:04,783
Rym: religion talk about masturbation.

120
00:12:04,843 --> 00:12:07,030
Rym: nor are we going to talk a lot about the biology of it?

121
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:18,354
Rym: No We're only going to talk about it from a practical human standpoint and also from a to Guy geeks who recently got out of college Standpoints.

122
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:18,957
Scott: Yes.

123
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:30,747
Rym: Well it all started when Puberty, yep I remember very clearly the day the very moment when I realized the opportunities that awaited me.

124
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:33,695
Scott: I Also remember the same thing.

125
00:12:34,197 --> 00:12:34,357
Rym: Yep.

126
00:12:34,678 --> 00:12:38,270
Rym: Now one last disclaimer is that this episode is going to be mostly personal anecdotes.

127
00:12:39,412 --> 00:12:40,757
Scott: It really can't be much else.

128
00:12:41,078 --> 00:12:45,630
Scott: Yeah, I mean an impersonal anecdote would be non masturbatory.

129
00:12:46,714 --> 00:12:50,026
Scott: I mean if someone else you can't be masturbated by someone else.

130
00:12:50,126 --> 00:12:50,407
Scott: It's just.

131
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,515
Rym: yep That's the other thing.

132
00:12:52,535 --> 00:12:55,566
Rym: We're not going to talk about sex relationships anything else.

133
00:12:55,606 --> 00:13:03,576
Rym: This is purely masturbation as it stands on its own auto-eroticism not however Autoerotic asphyxiation.

134
00:13:03,857 --> 00:13:07,190
Rym: No while I don't you wouldn't think I'd need to make that disclaimer.

135
00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:12,976
Rym: You would be surprised how often that term comes up on the internet in casual conversation Scarily often.

136
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:15,910
Rym: So anyway the exact moments.

137
00:13:16,711 --> 00:13:22,628
Scott: Well, it all started, you know my guy like to look at naked girls looking at some porn and mr.

138
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:23,270
Scott: Wee wee goes.

139
00:13:24,973 --> 00:13:27,270
Scott: It feels real good when you when you look at naked ladies

140
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:40,870
Rym: see I remember when I was very young and I was just starting to go through puberty and I'd be like I'd be swinging around on Monkey bars and I'd my pants be moving a certain way and I'd feel something like that's a good feeling whatever it is And I never quite knew where it came from and it would come and go randomly.

141
00:13:41,251 --> 00:13:54,008
Rym: Yep, and it was one day that I was sitting in my little bedroom and I'm thinking like I've heard of beating off That's what everyone called it where I was when I was young and like I'd heard this term and it wasn't really like.

142
00:13:54,068 --> 00:13:56,938
Rym: I basically Knew from sex ed in school and various things.

143
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,085
Rym: I knew what a penis was.

144
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:05,270
Rym: I knew that I had one I knew what it did in most cases and I knew that sex made babies and all that sort of thing.

145
00:14:05,975 --> 00:14:10,760
Rym: but I wasn't quite sure of the mechanics of Autoerotically arousing myself.

146
00:14:11,264 --> 00:14:12,130
Rym: I didn't really well.

147
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:18,590
Rym: I obviously didn't think of it in those terms and I just remember one day I'm sitting there and I was thinking about things.

148
00:14:19,057 --> 00:14:27,438
Rym: I was thinking about Someone I knew when I was that age and I was going through that sort of time and I thought well they call it Beating off do you hit it?

149
00:14:27,719 --> 00:14:28,462
Rym: and that didn't work.

150
00:14:28,964 --> 00:14:29,868
Rym: That was a bad idea.

151
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:40,803
Rym: And then I thought back to my little sex ed book where they talked about, you know, how sex works and I thought oh Maybe if I just kind of simulate the action of it going into something.

152
00:14:41,205 --> 00:14:41,748
Rym: What'll I use?

153
00:14:41,768 --> 00:14:42,170
Rym: What'll I use?

154
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:45,107
Rym: Well, I got this sock and the rest was history.

155
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:50,069
Scott: Yep me it was more like, you know, I knew that.

156
00:14:51,633 --> 00:15:05,330
Scott: Well at first when I was a little kid I had a little book I said how babies are made and I knew that like Sperms came out of the man and went into the woman but didn't know that they were like Actual, you know, I didn't quite grasp the concept of these physical things.

157
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:12,197
Scott: I sort of I guess when I was a little kid, I imagined them crawling across the bed Going.

158
00:15:12,258 --> 00:15:14,854
Scott: I don't know what I was thinking You know.

159
00:15:14,895 --> 00:15:21,643
Scott: and then sex ed came around that I knew that You know penis shot out white stuff and that was the sperms and all that.

160
00:15:21,844 --> 00:15:22,486
Scott: and I knew that.

161
00:15:22,867 --> 00:15:30,809
Scott: look at it Girlies made it, you know stand up and feel good and I knew that you put it in the girlie You know to make the stuff happen.

162
00:15:31,792 --> 00:15:33,566
Scott: But you know, I like how you say girly.

163
00:15:33,707 --> 00:15:36,500
Scott: Yeah But well in those days it was a girly.

164
00:15:36,922 --> 00:15:38,990
Scott: you still say was I yeah, whatever?

165
00:15:40,192 --> 00:15:49,229
Rym: But I didn't really fully realize like oh, yeah, you know, yeah Yep, I had all sorts of kind of vague notions and I really wasn't sure.

166
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:56,077
Scott: yeah So, you know, I would look at prawns on the internet and playboys or whatever and you know I didn't really do that so much.

167
00:15:56,137 --> 00:15:57,810
Rym: I just had a very active imagination.

168
00:15:58,312 --> 00:16:02,047
Scott: Yeah, even when I I would imagine also sometimes laying in bed at night and such.

169
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:02,529
Rym: Yeah.

170
00:16:02,549 --> 00:16:13,530
Rym: Yep and I think every kid has the the recurring theme of you're laying in bed and your mom opens your bedroom doors terms in and You're in a way pitching a tent.

171
00:16:13,911 --> 00:16:23,710
Rym: So what you do and I think every boy learned right away to do this is you immediately pull your knees up Yep, so you're just laying there your hands probably behind your back or behind your head like nothing's going on.

172
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:28,590
Rym: You're just kind of the knees are holding the sheets up kind of keeping everything hidden.

173
00:16:29,174 --> 00:16:30,789
Scott: You got to use a bigger tent to hide a little one.

174
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:35,869
Rym: You don't roll over on your side, but that doesn't work because then you just crush it.

175
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:41,207
Scott: Yeah, and then one time, you know, I mean I knew that there was some sort of masturbation.

176
00:16:41,247 --> 00:16:42,993
Scott: people talked about it But I never did it.

177
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:46,828
Scott: and then you know one time I like I'll touch.

178
00:16:46,848 --> 00:16:49,537
Scott: Ooh If I touch it, it feels good.

179
00:16:49,577 --> 00:16:54,579
Scott: Well, it didn't take much after that and you know I just you know, I touched it and it felt real good.

180
00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:55,041
Scott: That was that.

181
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:59,278
Scott: and then one day I was like, you know The stuff doesn't come out.

182
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:00,564
Rym: Oh, I have a story about this.

183
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:03,989
Scott: Yeah, and then I was like Stuff's supposed to come out.

184
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:11,782
Scott: Hmm what if I all right, I'm gonna do it this time I'm just gonna keep playing with it until the stuff comes out.

185
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:13,069
Scott: Yep, and it worked.

186
00:17:13,472 --> 00:17:19,380
Rym: I had the exact same thing is the first time I ever did anything and I Did it a little bit like a minute maybe and I stopped.

187
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,207
Rym: I was like that was the best thing ever.

188
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:29,143
Rym: Yep Like I don't screw video games Seriously, and I and I didn't realize that I could have kept going.

189
00:17:29,204 --> 00:17:33,659
Rym: I stopped because I was afraid I was gonna break it or Myself because it's so close to pain.

190
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,327
Rym: It's like one step before pain is awesome.

191
00:17:36,628 --> 00:17:39,549
Rym: Mm-hmm And one day I was like, what if I just keep going?

192
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:43,126
Rym: Well, they'd keep happening and I learned that no does not keep happening.

193
00:17:43,186 --> 00:17:43,930
Rym: It comes to an end.

194
00:17:44,071 --> 00:17:46,530
Rym: I make a mess and then I go to sleep exactly.

195
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:53,230
Rym: Then I decide it became integrated as it does with every young boy unless you have a very tortured childhood.

196
00:17:53,493 --> 00:17:55,030
Rym: It became integrated into my lifestyle.

197
00:17:55,706 --> 00:18:00,278
Scott: Yeah I mean You sort of have this biological need To do it every once in a while.

198
00:18:00,318 --> 00:18:04,174
Scott: if you don't it comes out at night in this in your sleep And it doesn't feel good.

199
00:18:04,194 --> 00:18:07,625
Rym: Yeah, it makes a mess all of the people who maybe.

200
00:18:07,685 --> 00:18:14,547
Rym: well if you haven't gone through puberty yet I hope you're not breaking any laws listening to this because America's actually kind of prudish about this sort of thing.

201
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:17,150
Rym: stupid America But especially for women out there.

202
00:18:17,292 --> 00:18:32,950
Rym: I hope you all realize that You might think men are vulgar for masturbating as often as we do or you may not realize how often men in general actually Masturbate, but I am not kidding when I tell you that there are consequences to not masturbating that are painful and annoying for us.

203
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:36,430
Scott: Yeah, if I don't do it after like I don't a couple weeks.

204
00:18:37,212 --> 00:18:43,030
Scott: It hurts and I get headaches and it's really uncomfortable and I'll keep getting erections all the time.

205
00:18:43,277 --> 00:18:49,374
Scott: Yes It really wants to go because it's full up with sperm and they have to get out and then eventually we'll just have a wet Drain and make a horrible mess.

206
00:18:49,675 --> 00:19:05,483
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I'd rather have some good feelings, you know while I'm awake and Be able to manage the mess in a way that is Clean then have to go to sleep not get any good feelings wake up with some goop in my pants And it's not good.

207
00:19:05,503 --> 00:19:10,102
Rym: Yep But integrating it into the lifestyle is out.

208
00:19:10,122 --> 00:19:16,950
Rym: for I mean, we have a lot of listeners not in America And I guess I would like to say that it's very different in America than it is in many other places

209
00:19:17,172 --> 00:19:18,869
Scott: Not like we know what it's like in the other places

210
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:22,343
Rym: No, but just from what we've read and what we can tell Americans are very.

211
00:19:22,363 --> 00:19:32,307
Rym: it's one of these situations where everyone does it and Despite this no one really wants to talk about it which created many awkward situations in college, which we'll get to.

212
00:19:32,327 --> 00:19:41,326
Rym: Oh, yeah Yeah, we have college stories But as it became apparent to me, especially after puberty kind of finished and I was.

213
00:19:41,888 --> 00:19:47,325
Rym: now I'm a man I am I'm manly in my ways and manner and I am fully ready to copulate and all that sort of thing.

214
00:19:47,345 --> 00:19:49,472
Rym: I Remember it.

215
00:19:50,234 --> 00:19:58,361
Rym: it took some effort to actually properly integrate it into the lifestyle in the sense that you had to hide it from everyone Despite the fact that everyone knew what you were doing.

216
00:19:58,903 --> 00:19:59,707
Scott: Yeah, it's not like.

217
00:19:59,827 --> 00:20:03,763
Scott: I could just You know whip it out and do it in the minute.

218
00:20:03,783 --> 00:20:05,090
Scott: It's not like, you know, you got to pee.

219
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,717
Scott: Well, you go up and you go to the bathroom you pee.

220
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,696
Scott: Well once a you know every few days or so You got a jerk off.

221
00:20:10,716 --> 00:20:12,890
Scott: It's not like you just get up and go jerk off.

222
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:15,726
Scott: You have to find a private place someplace secret.

223
00:20:15,766 --> 00:20:19,822
Scott: We have enough time Yeah and enough tools if you need tools.

224
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:21,830
Rym: and yeah, I'm more of two minds than that.

225
00:20:22,071 --> 00:20:25,124
Rym: I have almost never engaged in pornography.

226
00:20:25,626 --> 00:20:29,579
Rym: in terms of masturbation I usually just use my imagination which is quite fertile.

227
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:43,850
Scott: Yeah imaginations fertile, but you know, it's like catalyst porn, you know, you want to maybe speed it up or you know Get going quicker and then you know, you look at the horn to get going and then you turn it off.

228
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:47,350
Rym: There are definitely two kinds of masturbation for men.

229
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:57,170
Rym: There is the I am masturbating because I am aroused and this is the only way to sate me because I'm alone Haha, and then there is the I have to masturbate now.

230
00:20:57,351 --> 00:21:00,228
Rym: I'm going to do it and be done with it like it's a chore and then go to bed.

231
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,520
Scott: Of course just because it's a chore doesn't mean it can't be fun.

232
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,090
Rym: Yeah, but it's definitely not as good as the other kind.

233
00:21:06,492 --> 00:21:13,410
Rym: Yep, I mean there are definitely times when it's like And you do a little like two-minute quickie make a mess into a tissue and go to bed.

234
00:21:15,653 --> 00:21:21,810
Scott: I actually I would highly recommend against tissue, but we'll get into that All right, and then we get in there right now right now to deal with the mess.

235
00:21:22,202 --> 00:21:28,404
Rym: All right And the mess he also comes into play in terms of how to avoid getting caught by your parents Even though don't kid yourself.

236
00:21:28,424 --> 00:21:29,130
Rym: They know what you're doing.

237
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:29,533
Scott: Well, that's it.

238
00:21:29,594 --> 00:21:39,184
Rym: We'll do how not to get caught after we do how to clean up all right, but I will say right now your parents know what you're doing and Most kids don't realize this until long after they finished worrying about their parents.

239
00:21:39,204 --> 00:21:45,587
Rym: then they realize that wait a minute Every time I was in the bathroom for like an hour and dad was standing out there.

240
00:21:45,627 --> 00:21:51,042
Scott: He knew ah but Yeah, unless you have crazy like I don't know.

241
00:21:51,062 --> 00:21:52,226
Scott: What's the religions that care?

242
00:21:52,527 --> 00:21:53,150
Rym: whole bunch of them?

243
00:21:53,430 --> 00:22:00,547
Scott: Yeah, unless you're one of those religions that care Your parents know and just don't talk about it or if they're really cool.

244
00:22:00,567 --> 00:22:01,270
Scott: They'll talk about it.

245
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,622
Scott: That's like, you know, you got good parents.

246
00:22:02,683 --> 00:22:06,904
Scott: if they say something Yep, but if they say something like don't do that and they beat you.

247
00:22:07,024 --> 00:22:08,550
Scott: well now you have crazy religious parents.

248
00:22:08,652 --> 00:22:09,506
Scott: Yeah, you should get rid of them.

249
00:22:10,658 --> 00:22:14,538
Scott: not really All right, so how to clean up the mess?

250
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,110
Rym: well one there are many schools of thought here.

251
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:24,969
Scott: Yes, uh to be honest the first thing I tried because I didn't really under you know I didn't knew what how it was gonna come out what it was gonna be how much.

252
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:28,168
Scott: So the first time I ever did it I had a cup.

253
00:22:32,472 --> 00:22:37,666
Scott: I caught it in a cup to see what it would take so I could examine it and shit Yeah, I used the inside of a sock.

254
00:22:38,028 --> 00:22:42,161
Scott: Yep The inside of a sock is a highly recommended method.

255
00:22:42,201 --> 00:22:42,441
Scott: Yes.

256
00:22:42,562 --> 00:22:44,889
Rym: However, make sure your sock is not terribly abrasive.

257
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:50,684
Rym: Yes get to do not do not Accidentally put that sock on.

258
00:22:50,805 --> 00:22:56,490
Scott: Yeah So what you want to do is you want to find a buy all new socks or find socks?

259
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,374
Scott: So you don't wear anymore, you know You've got socks.

260
00:22:58,455 --> 00:23:03,279
Scott: like you buy socks and you buy different socks And then you still have some of the old ones.

261
00:23:03,701 --> 00:23:04,505
Scott: use those old ones.

262
00:23:04,686 --> 00:23:13,330
Rym: now in the very least Just if you have all new socks, just pick a pair put it aside treat it separately from the rest and Just keep track and use that one all the time.

263
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:13,751
Rym: Here's a.

264
00:23:13,932 --> 00:23:14,715
Scott: here's a helpful hint.

265
00:23:14,896 --> 00:23:18,610
Scott: take a sharpie put a black mark on the inside of the of the side.

266
00:23:18,651 --> 00:23:19,709
Rym: Yes, now don't write.

267
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:24,082
Scott: Masturbation saw no just like a black line in there something like that.

268
00:23:24,162 --> 00:23:25,767
Scott: I have a couple socks with a black line on him.

269
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,496
Rym: Ah Actually, what I did is I have one.

270
00:23:28,556 --> 00:23:32,990
Rym: I had a pair of boxers that was old and ratty and it was literally a loincloth.

271
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:35,802
Rym: Yeah, I had that pair though I wore that pair of boxers.

272
00:23:35,883 --> 00:23:37,490
Rym: actually that's a different pair of boxers.

273
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:49,210
Rym: Oh, wow I'm the kind of person aside from masturbation who just doesn't throw clothes away and I had a pair of underwear that I finally threw away because it was basically just a loincloth and it disintegrated entirely one day.

274
00:23:49,551 --> 00:23:59,642
Rym: No washer, but no I had one pair one pair of boxers that I always use because it was nice It was the right consistency it washed Well, it didn't stain too badly and I just always use that boxer.

275
00:23:59,843 --> 00:24:07,065
Rym: and when I was young and my mom still did my laundry I washed it on my own in the sink and made sure that she never came into contact with it.

276
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:08,390
Scott: Yeah, that's a good move.

277
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:11,262
Rym: I assume she just thought I lost that boxer if she even knew or cared.

278
00:24:11,282 --> 00:24:18,210
Scott: That's the thing about a sock is if you You can sometimes get your mom to clean the socks because she won't know that they're any different from any other socks.

279
00:24:18,835 --> 00:24:20,330
Scott: Or she might know and not say anything.

280
00:24:20,571 --> 00:24:27,398
Rym: She probably knows probably because if you think you're all clever wad the sock up She'll flip it out and she'll know right away.

281
00:24:27,639 --> 00:24:29,926
Scott: Yeah, if your mom's cool, she won't say anything.

282
00:24:29,946 --> 00:24:33,507
Rym: if your mom's if your mom's awesome She'll say I'll buy you a frickin rag.

283
00:24:33,548 --> 00:24:36,428
Scott: Just don't Don't lay socks.

284
00:24:38,111 --> 00:24:40,727
Scott: Yeah, if your mom's uncool she'll yell at you or something.

285
00:24:40,989 --> 00:24:52,330
Rym: now I very much love the mind though when I was very young I often did it in bed just because I couldn't get away with doing anywhere else But bed still a good place because I'm of the opinion that if you're reclining it is much more pleasurable.

286
00:24:52,712 --> 00:24:54,841
Rym: Yes, though often I found that standing is very good.

287
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:56,850
Scott: And as a result, I have a trouble with the standing.

288
00:24:57,212 --> 00:25:00,164
Rym: I primarily masturbate in the shower something.

289
00:25:00,204 --> 00:25:02,691
Rym: I never thought I'd say on the internet Hmm.

290
00:25:03,092 --> 00:25:03,774
Scott: Well, there you have it.

291
00:25:03,994 --> 00:25:14,109
Rym: Yep, almost always I I don't want to say that every time I take a shower but 90% of the time when I take a shower in my own home.

292
00:25:15,835 --> 00:25:17,387
Scott: Yeah, well, let me quote the man show.

293
00:25:17,508 --> 00:25:25,830
Scott: actually I remember I was watching the man show when it was old and good and One guy from the audience asked if I go to like my friend's house, you know, and he has a wife.

294
00:25:27,072 --> 00:25:35,710
Scott: I never I didn't see this but I've heard this one like if he's the guy basically was gonna sleep over at a friend's house and the friend had a wife and kids and everything and He's like is it you know?

295
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:37,857
Scott: Is it good etiquette for me to masturbate in the shower?

296
00:25:37,917 --> 00:25:52,478
Scott: and the man show said and I agree and I think everyone else will too That not only is it okay to masturbate in the shower, but that is in fact the good etiquette I mean, we're also gonna masturbate the kids bedroom You know like a sign of respect.

297
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:57,597
Scott: yeah, the shower is the best place because number one The mess goes away.

298
00:25:57,617 --> 00:25:58,321
Scott: You don't worry about it.

299
00:25:59,004 --> 00:26:01,800
Scott: Yep, usually number two No one's gonna bother you in the shower.

300
00:26:01,981 --> 00:26:02,363
Scott: privacy.

301
00:26:02,544 --> 00:26:06,786
Rym: now number three Not only is it easy cleanup, but you've got a lot of water there.

302
00:26:06,826 --> 00:26:07,550
Rym: That's very handy.

303
00:26:07,953 --> 00:26:09,930
Rym: You can direct that showerhead in certain ways.

304
00:26:11,311 --> 00:26:14,701
Rym: You got some conditioner there, which I highly recommend using conditioner.

305
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:17,770
Scott: Nick soaps good depending not depends on the soap.

306
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:18,653
Scott: Yes on the soap.

307
00:26:18,693 --> 00:26:20,138
Scott: soap soaps will fuck you.

308
00:26:20,299 --> 00:26:21,503
Scott: some soaps will be just great.

309
00:26:21,764 --> 00:26:23,470
Rym: Yeah when in doubt use conditioner.

310
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,460
Rym: It's probably the most benign substance in there.

311
00:26:25,762 --> 00:26:27,270
Scott: Yeah, baby lotions good.

312
00:26:27,872 --> 00:26:30,600
Scott: Yeah, just water though not good.

313
00:26:30,901 --> 00:26:33,790
Rym: No no just water is worse than nothing.

314
00:26:34,091 --> 00:26:35,236
Scott: Yeah, just water.

315
00:26:35,457 --> 00:26:38,470
Scott: It'll be all dry and chafee and you'll hurt yourself.

316
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:44,370
Rym: Yeah, like literally just water you'll feel like it's all lubricated, but no you're basically just scraping it all off.

317
00:26:44,571 --> 00:26:52,008
Scott: You're scraping that skin right away And you'll come out and you have this red stick right in front of you And you go ow every time something touches it and you'll put underwear on.

318
00:26:52,048 --> 00:26:52,370
Scott: it'll hurt.

319
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,904
Scott: Yeah, don't use just water.

320
00:26:55,607 --> 00:26:58,596
Scott: I mean a Plain hand with hand oil that's.

321
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:02,268
Scott: the other thing is in the shower your the oils on your hand have been washed off.

322
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:08,570
Scott: that Really, it's better to do with a bare hand on a bare penis than a wet hand on a wet penis.

323
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,759
Rym: Yep, now we said the mess goes away, and that's usually true.

324
00:27:10,819 --> 00:27:13,489
Rym: however one because we've run a follow this before one.

325
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:21,780
Rym: I do not masturbate in other people's showers actually or in hotels or any any place where I'm with other people Masturbated in a hotel.

326
00:27:22,122 --> 00:27:32,681
Rym: once however Someone we don't know who when we were at Otakon two years ago masturbated in the shower and left some leavings.

327
00:27:33,795 --> 00:27:34,408
Scott: Don't do that.

328
00:27:34,883 --> 00:27:35,672
Rym: Yeah When you make the

329
00:27:35,712 --> 00:27:39,425
Scott: shower head off and aim it at it and disintegrate it and make it sure it goes down

330
00:27:39,506 --> 00:27:44,447
Rym: because unless because most People I assume are not staring at their own penis when they're masturbating

331
00:27:44,869 --> 00:27:46,314
Scott: nope I

332
00:27:46,736 --> 00:27:59,358
Rym: would I would probably say that many of you especially if you're new at this I don't know May not realize the force with it with which it is ejected and the fact that it will go far and beyond Anything you could imagine.

333
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:01,190
Rym: you will find it in the damnedest of places.

334
00:28:01,571 --> 00:28:10,821
Scott: this is a fact if your penis was the width and girth of a fire hose and You jerked it off aiming it at a steel door.

335
00:28:11,142 --> 00:28:13,089
Scott: You would knock that door down.

336
00:28:14,052 --> 00:28:22,240
Rym: I have hinges and all I have anecdotes that I probably would not want to share because they're not directly related to masturbation But let me just say that it goes quite far.

337
00:28:22,621 --> 00:28:33,443
Scott: Yep, and with quite a bit of force It's all sort of Gaussian in its push push push push push push push go Like a gauss rifle only without magnet.

338
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:34,710
Scott: It's a gauss rifle without magnets.

339
00:28:34,771 --> 00:28:35,665
Scott: That's exactly what it is.

340
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:42,610
Rym: But yeah If you for whatever reason decide to masturbate in someone else's shower make sure you didn't leave anything behind.

341
00:28:43,172 --> 00:28:44,217
Rym: That's all I ask.

342
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:50,004
Scott: Yeah, cuz if people see that, you know Whether their opinions about masturbation are doesn't matter.

343
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:52,813
Scott: They're gonna be like, oh You're disgusting person.

344
00:28:53,214 --> 00:28:59,131
Rym: Oh, yeah, because once again even me and Rym will say you the basic etiquette of masturbation seems to be everyone Does it.

345
00:28:59,252 --> 00:29:04,350
Rym: everyone knows everyone does it but don't talk about it and more importantly don't get caught doing it.

346
00:29:04,731 --> 00:29:08,382
Scott: Yeah, even if you don't talk about it getting caught doing it is just.

347
00:29:08,703 --> 00:29:10,910
Scott: you know, people don't care that you do it.

348
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:15,939
Scott: They care that they had to see you doing it and even though I don't want to see you doing it unless you're a hot girl.

349
00:29:17,872 --> 00:29:28,841
Rym: Talking just about male masturbation here though I will point out that more than one of our female friends when they heard that we were doing this episode said that they're going To record or do their own sort of female version of this for us.

350
00:29:29,383 --> 00:29:29,684
Scott: Awesome.

351
00:29:29,925 --> 00:29:30,787
Rym: That is awesome.

352
00:29:31,128 --> 00:29:36,700
Scott: Totally awesome But that's something I need to know more about As does the world.

353
00:29:36,801 --> 00:29:37,589
Rym: but I digress.

354
00:29:38,915 --> 00:29:39,709
Rym: Where was I going?

355
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:41,315
Scott: You were jerking it.

356
00:29:41,515 --> 00:29:42,398
Rym: No, I really wasn't.

357
00:29:42,418 --> 00:29:44,043
Rym: I'm wearing my dog Zelda pajamas.

358
00:29:44,304 --> 00:29:46,330
Scott: Yeah, you know what those are for actually?

359
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:46,834
Rym: No, they're not.

360
00:29:46,854 --> 00:29:48,123
Rym: I wouldn't want to defile these.

361
00:29:48,143 --> 00:29:53,733
Scott: I know I know All right, so we talked about how to prevent the mess You can use.

362
00:29:53,753 --> 00:29:55,879
Scott: a sock is good a tissue is bad.

363
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,026
Scott: toilet paper is bad because they disintegrate.

364
00:29:58,387 --> 00:29:58,527
Scott: not

365
00:29:58,567 --> 00:30:17,458
Rym: only they disintegrate But usually in the heat of your you know Self-inflicted passion you will end up holding the wad of tissue or whatever directly against the penis and as a result you will come if you will if I may if I might and The tissue will now be effectively rabbit.

366
00:30:17,518 --> 00:30:33,950
Scott: you might glued to the end of your penis or worse The moisture from the gisms will disintegrate the you know paper Because it's a weak-ass paper like a tissue or a toilet paper and little bits of it will get stuck all over the place.

367
00:30:34,371 --> 00:30:44,963
Rym: Also, you now have to dispose of the tissue and I'll tell you that if you just put it in the garbage Everyone knows if they see your garbage full of a thousand tissues and you don't have allergies.

368
00:30:44,984 --> 00:30:46,167
Rym: You're done.

369
00:30:46,187 --> 00:30:48,134
Rym: I Have allergies.

370
00:30:48,435 --> 00:30:51,209
Rym: I'd have an excuse even though I never I've never used a tissue in my life.

371
00:30:51,431 --> 00:30:52,878
Scott: And what are those box of tissues right there?

372
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,125
Rym: I have allergies.

373
00:30:54,426 --> 00:30:58,370
Rym: All right I masturbate into those boxers that are in my hand.

374
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,990
Scott: Anyway Yeah paper towel works.

375
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:08,805
Scott: Okay in a pinch because it doesn't disintegrate and it absorbs and it's a lot bigger.

376
00:31:08,845 --> 00:31:13,406
Rym: and if you can catch it with however Do not use the paper towel in any way to stimulate.

377
00:31:13,426 --> 00:31:16,240
Scott: no No, no paper towel will chafe you to hell.

378
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,290
Rym: paper towel is just high-grade sandpaper.

379
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,876
Scott: Yeah, you want to keep the paper towel.

380
00:31:19,896 --> 00:31:27,285
Scott: what you do generally is you jerk it with some other means which we will explain and Then at the last second you grab the paper towel and hold it in front.

381
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:32,905
Rym: Yep Now we said we were gonna talk a bit about how to avoid getting caught and such.

382
00:31:32,965 --> 00:31:39,066
Rym: now growing up I remember it was very much a game of cat and mouse and luckily I had my own room.

383
00:31:39,507 --> 00:31:40,370
Scott: So my room is key.

384
00:31:40,511 --> 00:31:43,389
Rym: Yeah, so I'd go into my room and I actually had a lock on my door.

385
00:31:43,711 --> 00:31:51,376
Rym: So there were other than the few times when I didn't lock the door and even that I never really got caught because I was Very quick about it about putting my.

386
00:31:51,497 --> 00:31:56,310
Rym: oh, I was very quick about putting my stuff away or some way hiding what I was doing.

387
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:10,299
Scott: Yeah, the key to not getting caught is if you're in a house with a family or something You're that young you want to do it in bed under the blanket late at night or something like that when no one's home.

388
00:32:11,103 --> 00:32:11,765
Scott: All that good stuff.

389
00:32:12,468 --> 00:32:15,239
Rym: Um, I've known people who would when they were in the bathroom.

390
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:19,197
Rym: anyway You know as a number two sitting there, they try to kill two birds with one stone.

391
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:19,760
Rym: bad move.

392
00:32:20,182 --> 00:32:24,036
Rym: It's a bad move mostly because one everyone's gonna wonder why you were in the bathroom for an hour.

393
00:32:24,056 --> 00:32:26,413
Rym: Mm-hmm Number two, you're probably gonna make a mess.

394
00:32:26,434 --> 00:32:27,100
Rym: You didn't realize.

395
00:32:27,881 --> 00:32:38,179
Rym: mmm number three This has happened to people I'd never happened to me or anyone I knew but I've heard many Anecdotes of people who I mean a lot of people will often be very tired or fall asleep after they finish.

396
00:32:39,161 --> 00:32:46,426
Rym: Nothing is worse than falling asleep in your bathroom and being woken up an hour later by your mom and you're laying there with your Penis in your hands.

397
00:32:46,446 --> 00:32:58,948
Scott: or you're sitting just asleep and you got poop in the toilet and there's some white stuff on the wall and There's a really funny image in my head, yeah That should be in a movie or something.

398
00:32:58,988 --> 00:33:01,140
Rym: There's actually a webcomic that did that exact thing.

399
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,171
Scott: Yeah now in college, which is probably the next phase of your life.

400
00:33:04,332 --> 00:33:06,400
Scott: Yes, you uh, it's pretty easy.

401
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,954
Scott: You're gonna do it either in the shower.

402
00:33:08,115 --> 00:33:08,620
Scott: Just all right.

403
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:15,599
Scott: Just make sure you wash it away because you're sharing showers in a dorm Or you do in your dorm room in which case the roommate is there now?

404
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,166
Rym: Despite the fact that everyone's in college.

405
00:33:18,528 --> 00:33:21,380
Rym: Everyone is a freshman and thus no one knows the etiquette.

406
00:33:21,981 --> 00:33:26,713
Rym: Luckily the etiquette is passed down from upperclassmen unto the freshmen fairly quickly.

407
00:33:26,874 --> 00:33:29,179
Scott: step one share your schedule with your roommate.

408
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,548
Rym: now No one says here's my schedule.

409
00:33:31,608 --> 00:33:32,892
Rym: make your masturbation schedule.

410
00:33:33,193 --> 00:33:33,916
Rym: what happens?

411
00:33:34,317 --> 00:33:40,819
Rym: and and it's funny Oh every guy in college does this like automatically or if they don't the upperclassmen mention it and then they do it.

412
00:33:41,642 --> 00:33:43,909
Rym: You put your schedule just somewhere in public.

413
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:46,437
Scott: you print it out and you like bulletin board.

414
00:33:46,497 --> 00:33:50,060
Scott: you put it on a bulletin board And it looks like it's the for you to reference.

415
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:58,037
Rym: But really now you assume that the other person will do the same and they will Because they want the same thing you want unless they're one of those crazy religious people.

416
00:33:58,257 --> 00:34:00,771
Rym: in which case Well, we won't get into that.

417
00:34:00,892 --> 00:34:09,692
Rym: Yeah, we have stories But then all you do is look at their schedule and say oh, all right He has an economics class from 6 to 10 every Wednesday.

418
00:34:10,112 --> 00:34:11,880
Rym: That is now masturbation day for him.

419
00:34:12,081 --> 00:34:16,420
Scott: Now what you got to do here is he's not gonna go to that class on 6 to 10 every Wednesday.

420
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,434
Scott: He might skip it and that's where you got trouble.

421
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:25,300
Scott: What you do is You don't do it until 7. if he's not there at 7 that means he went to the class.

422
00:34:25,882 --> 00:34:28,532
Scott: If he is there at 7 that means he's not going to the class.

423
00:34:28,552 --> 00:34:32,525
Scott: you say yep, or you might say hey Don't you have a class or something?

424
00:34:33,168 --> 00:34:38,826
Scott: You know, maybe well if he skips one class, you know He's probably not gonna skip the next one now.

425
00:34:39,348 --> 00:34:43,639
Scott: There are some specific situations such as a roommate skips every class.

426
00:34:44,271 --> 00:34:47,347
Scott: You know You have two or three roommates.

427
00:34:47,387 --> 00:34:49,393
Rym: Oh my god, we can tell the story about Greg.

428
00:34:49,714 --> 00:34:56,353
Rym: Yeah our friend Greg The poor bastard he had a roommate who didn't do anything but play.

429
00:34:56,373 --> 00:34:57,557
Rym: What was the Asheron's call?

430
00:34:57,738 --> 00:35:04,879
Scott: played Asheron's call He went to class He slept barely and he would go to the food place get food bring it back and play Asheron's call.

431
00:35:04,899 --> 00:35:13,957
Rym: while eating He was basically always in the room to the point that our friend could probably not ever masturbate Effectively or I mean he really had no way to do it easily.

432
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:19,597
Rym: Yep Yeah, he was not a happy person Unhappy as hell because once again headaches.

433
00:35:20,983 --> 00:35:27,193
Scott: What you can try to do is wait until you know The other guy is a hundred percent asleep and then try to do it under the covers.

434
00:35:27,233 --> 00:35:27,735
Rym: I've done that.

435
00:35:28,116 --> 00:35:28,337
Rym: Yep.

436
00:35:28,738 --> 00:35:30,476
Rym: It's fine Yeah, it's the other guys.

437
00:35:30,981 --> 00:35:32,246
Rym: It because there was one.

438
00:35:32,266 --> 00:35:33,069
Rym: there were a couple times.

439
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:37,130
Rym: I'd be laying in my bunk and I'd be just laying there and I'd hear And it's obvious to me.

440
00:35:37,271 --> 00:35:39,202
Rym: All right, that dude's masturbating I'm just gonna.

441
00:35:39,523 --> 00:35:43,118
Rym: not I'll ignore it because he was probably awake a few nights ago when I did it.

442
00:35:43,459 --> 00:35:53,905
Scott: Yep now if someone uh, you know, if you're in a dorm room and some guy says you jerking it just be like Just be like, yeah, what of it?

443
00:35:54,667 --> 00:35:57,354
Scott: Yeah, I'll be like, you know, like you do it too.

444
00:35:57,955 --> 00:35:58,717
Scott: What down man.

445
00:35:58,878 --> 00:36:03,530
Rym: now when I did it I learned right away that if I'm gonna do it I wouldn't just jump into my bed and lay there and do it.

446
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:06,430
Rym: because if he walks in and I'm laying in my bed at Like 4 in the afternoon.

447
00:36:06,612 --> 00:36:09,470
Scott: Yeah No, you do it at night when everyone's asleep.

448
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,576
Rym: That's actually like.

449
00:36:10,636 --> 00:36:11,460
Rym: I knew he'd be at class.

450
00:36:11,641 --> 00:36:19,840
Rym: So what I do is I'd sit in my computer chair and I'd open like slash dot Just so it'd be there ready and I have the mouse ready and I do my thing.

451
00:36:19,921 --> 00:36:23,123
Rym: but I have my pants kind of like down a bit but Ready because it.

452
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:29,805
Rym: basically there was always a thump and then a click and I had about four seconds between when I heard a noise Until the door could actually be opened.

453
00:36:30,427 --> 00:36:34,360
Rym: Mm-hmm, and I was the Mac master of pulling my pants up pulling my shirt down.

454
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,386
Rym: I'd looks like I'm surfing slash dot once.

455
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:39,917
Scott: I was almost saved by the chain because we have a chain the door.

456
00:36:39,957 --> 00:36:43,834
Scott: that way at The absolute worst he opens the door.

457
00:36:43,934 --> 00:36:44,456
Scott: It's chained.

458
00:36:44,477 --> 00:36:47,657
Scott: He can't get in I have to unchain it after getting my pants on.

459
00:36:47,878 --> 00:36:52,690
Rym: however Bear in mind that in college if your door is chained That means I was just masturbating.

460
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:58,799
Scott: and I have now told you exactly the one time I got the pants on and I took the chain off and then you open the door.

461
00:37:00,043 --> 00:37:01,191
Scott: It was it was masterwork.

462
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,323
Rym: I Remember one time.

463
00:37:03,343 --> 00:37:06,053
Rym: I'm pretty sure he'd figured out what I was doing because I pulled my.

464
00:37:06,194 --> 00:37:21,387
Rym: I did my you know standard trick and I'm surfing slash shot and he walks in and he stops a second and he looks at me and I'm sitting there and I'm just kind of moving the wrong mouse around cuz I'm like And I click on a link And he just walks by me with this.

465
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:21,749
Rym: he did.

466
00:37:21,789 --> 00:37:23,234
Rym: he knew it's obvious.

467
00:37:23,255 --> 00:37:24,620
Scott: He knew he knew something was up.

468
00:37:24,941 --> 00:37:28,498
Rym: Yeah, I don't know what he thought I was doing, but he probably thought I was masturbating.

469
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:33,357
Rym: Yep And once you're out of college, well, once you're out of freshman year, it changes.

470
00:37:33,377 --> 00:37:39,346
Scott: Oh, yeah Well, it depends if you move if you're still in a dorm or if you're living with someone, you know Or who they are because

471
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:44,187
Rym: after our freshman year all of us all of our all of us who were good friends the front Row crew as it is today.

472
00:37:44,509 --> 00:37:59,233
Rym: We all moved in together not in one place but we all like lived with other members of the crew and At that point there was a there basically came a time fairly early on when everyone one day someone just like all right I'm gonna masturbate so you stay in that room.

473
00:37:59,635 --> 00:38:03,447
Scott: Yeah, like literally I just like Rym can you just stay in the bedroom there?

474
00:38:03,487 --> 00:38:06,560
Scott: I got a gonna jerk it and the etiquette disappeared.

475
00:38:06,821 --> 00:38:11,838
Rym: Well that etiquette disappeared and from this day forth the etiquette is simply been I'm gonna masturbate.

476
00:38:11,858 --> 00:38:13,524
Scott: don't bother me Yeah, you just say it.

477
00:38:13,605 --> 00:38:18,979
Scott: I mean the other guy doesn't care, you know, and if the other guy, you know You should want to make friends with people who don't care.

478
00:38:19,261 --> 00:38:26,480
Rym: Yeah, if your friends care that you masturbate like actually care unless you also care you're probably not really good friends.

479
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,720
Rym: It there's probably something wrong.

480
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,229
Rym: I mean, it's one thing to be like.

481
00:38:29,249 --> 00:38:32,471
Rym: you don't want to be that guy who runs around like masturbate.

482
00:38:33,782 --> 00:38:38,480
Scott: Yeah, and if they are really good friends, but no one, you know masturbation seems sort of taboo.

483
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:43,500
Scott: Just start talking about it and make it not taboo by talking about it, but don't go overboard.

484
00:38:43,581 --> 00:38:44,451
Rym: You don't want to be that guy.

485
00:38:44,471 --> 00:38:52,763
Scott: You don't want to be that guy who's just like constantly talking about sex, but You know make it not taboo in your group to say yeah I'm gonna jerk it.

486
00:38:52,924 --> 00:38:58,127
Scott: or you know start a conversation about jerking techniques or Listen to this episode with all your friends.

487
00:38:58,789 --> 00:39:00,092
Rym: Oh my god techniques.

488
00:39:00,494 --> 00:39:02,660
Rym: Okay, take now time before.

489
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:11,853
Rym: techniques vary greatly based on geography and knowledge passed on by older kids and Experimentation and websites that are no longer existing.

490
00:39:12,335 --> 00:39:13,580
Rym: You got some burping problems.

491
00:39:13,761 --> 00:39:15,408
Scott: I do hate those hot dogs and whatnot.

492
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:19,555
Rym: Now when we were in college, I believe it was sophomore year Maybe junior your price.

493
00:39:19,576 --> 00:39:23,804
Rym: sophomore year We discovered a website that no longer exists in the form It used to exist in.

494
00:39:24,326 --> 00:39:26,054
Scott: it now exists as a shitty pay site.

495
00:39:26,135 --> 00:39:27,220
Scott: Don't pay attention to it.

496
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,198
Scott: We're not even gonna link to it.

497
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:33,716
Rym: Yeah, no, but it used to be Jack insider calm and it was quite literally a masturbatory resource.

498
00:39:33,796 --> 00:39:36,802
Scott: Is the IMDB of Dragon draining?

499
00:39:37,123 --> 00:39:39,990
Rym: quite well dragon dragon dragon dragon.

500
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:40,512
Scott: Yeah.

501
00:39:40,612 --> 00:39:40,933
Scott: Yeah.

502
00:39:40,973 --> 00:39:41,234
Scott: Yeah.

503
00:39:41,294 --> 00:39:41,595
Scott: Okay.

504
00:39:41,735 --> 00:39:43,460
Rym: Well, I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.

505
00:39:47,040 --> 00:40:00,914
Rym: So anyway This website introduced us to a variety of techniques that we were dubious of but I will say that I did in fact Experiment with to great success the rosy palm and my personal favorite chopsticks chopsticks.

506
00:40:00,974 --> 00:40:03,782
Scott: All right chopsticks work for there's also the banana Which we'll talk about.

507
00:40:03,843 --> 00:40:04,545
Rym: god the banana.

508
00:40:04,926 --> 00:40:07,535
Scott: All right, first, let's talk about some some general things.

509
00:40:07,615 --> 00:40:13,203
Scott: if you want to end it quickly Just go nuts go Until you're done.

510
00:40:13,243 --> 00:40:13,404
Rym: Yep.

511
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:17,500
Rym: No, I don't think we need to explain to the guys out there how the penis works.

512
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:23,120
Rym: I don't think we need to say that the glands and it does this and this part does this.

513
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:28,809
Rym: The only thing I can say is that I do not know How foreskin comes into it because I do not have any.

514
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:32,200
Scott: I also do not have foreskin and therefore cannot comment on it.

515
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,323
Scott: Well, I can comment.

516
00:40:33,604 --> 00:40:39,040
Scott: I looked on the internet for pictures of foreskin to see what I was missing foreskin org and despite what?

517
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:43,312
Scott: You know Randy and all those people say yes circumcision doesn't prevent disease.

518
00:40:43,372 --> 00:40:50,917
Scott: I know yeah religious bullshit about it, whatever Penises with foreskin or nasty looking and penises without foreskin look nice though.

519
00:40:51,017 --> 00:40:59,340
Rym: I would say that They're probably only quote nasty looking unquote because they're alien and you're not used to them.

520
00:40:59,781 --> 00:41:01,289
Scott: That could very well be true.

521
00:41:01,389 --> 00:41:03,480
Scott: And in fact, I'm pretty sure it is but I don't care.

522
00:41:03,781 --> 00:41:06,809
Scott: It's my opinion that I dislike penises with foreskin.

523
00:41:06,929 --> 00:41:08,453
Rym: Well, I generally just like penises.

524
00:41:08,874 --> 00:41:09,716
Scott: Oh that that true.

525
00:41:09,977 --> 00:41:10,980
Rym: I really only like mine.

526
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:18,199
Rym: Yeah, my name and mine is generally annoying because he's often Bothersome when I am NOT in the mood to be bothered by him.

527
00:41:18,521 --> 00:41:23,880
Scott: I mean, I like the feelings that mine generates but as a a work of art mine isn't really the great.

528
00:41:24,903 --> 00:41:27,059
Rym: Oh mine is like a like a Greek God.

529
00:41:27,942 --> 00:41:36,397
Scott: Well, maybe mine is a Greek God in size and shape But alright so much We'll get this out right now.

530
00:41:37,182 --> 00:41:42,909
Rym: We always have a joke in our group where you know, two people are arguing and someone will say alright Just get the rulers bring them out and measure them.

531
00:41:43,291 --> 00:41:43,492
Scott: Yep.

532
00:41:43,653 --> 00:41:44,035
Scott: So we did.

533
00:41:44,337 --> 00:41:56,518
Rym: one day we did Basically, we both went into opposite rooms with rulers Got it to an erect state Put the ruler on Walk back out holding the ruler so that the amount of ruler protruding from our fist was the length of our penises.

534
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:56,899
Rym: and we

535
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,277
Scott: came up with a measurement standard like we're gonna measure from this spot to this spot

536
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:00,740
Rym: and we're like

537
00:42:00,981 --> 00:42:01,282
Scott: Ha

538
00:42:01,703 --> 00:42:06,479
Rym: and I will say right now that Scott's penis is almost exactly one centimeter longer than mine

539
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:15,654
Scott: one centi Yeah, so ladies if one centi means a lot You can you know call

540
00:42:16,096 --> 00:42:16,599
Rym: yeah, mr.

541
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,025
Scott: That's Rym's not even single.

542
00:42:18,106 --> 00:42:22,543
Scott: So if you know if you want to call anyone I'm free.

543
00:42:22,985 --> 00:42:26,780
Rym: Yeah, Scott Scott's a little free and desperate and such not so desperate.

544
00:42:27,121 --> 00:42:29,410
Scott: I mean if I was desperate I would be putting some more effort into it.

545
00:42:29,711 --> 00:42:34,712
Scott: Also, if you're like not of age I'm not a pedophile and I don't like little girlie.

546
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,480
Scott: So I don't know who's listening.

547
00:42:37,404 --> 00:42:38,577
Scott: Yeah, college girls are nice.

548
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,706
Scott: Anyway graduated girls are nicer.

549
00:42:41,766 --> 00:42:44,395
Rym: All right, we're talking about masturbation not finding you a girlfriend.

550
00:42:44,556 --> 00:42:50,019
Rym: Yeah, okay Well, I could do a whole show on finding you a girlfriend god damn, but anyway.

551
00:42:54,500 --> 00:43:00,960
Scott: So the general technique you want to do to make it feel really good is hold out as long as possible.

552
00:43:01,422 --> 00:43:08,920
Rym: Yep, in fact one of the techniques that was listed on Jack insider Which I used a great effect was the alarm clock method where you would masturbate.

553
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:16,234
Rym: However, you would look at a clock and basically every other minute on the digital clock You were not allowed to touch your penis at all.

554
00:43:16,255 --> 00:43:18,280
Scott: No matter what It's a good method.

555
00:43:18,421 --> 00:43:26,340
Rym: so you go and you're going you're getting close and then the minute changes and you just pull your hand away and Resist any urge to touch it and after about a half hour of that you'll go insane.

556
00:43:27,141 --> 00:43:32,900
Scott: Yeah, basically what happens is is just the tension builds and builds and builds and builds and builds over a long period of time.

557
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:38,842
Scott: so you have a whole bunch of time where you feel really good the whole time and you keep feeling better and better and Better.

558
00:43:38,923 --> 00:43:47,405
Scott: and then finally, you know It's it's like when you put a kink in the hose and this giant giant balloon fills up and you let the kink go when it Finally can't hold out any longer.

559
00:43:47,425 --> 00:43:49,734
Rym: now while we're not talking about sex.

560
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:51,400
Rym: We may someday do an episode on sex.

561
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,255
Rym: I mean, I don't know how popular this particular episode is going to be.

562
00:43:54,276 --> 00:44:02,853
Rym: Mm-hmm But I will say that the tech the the thing we just talked about is very Pertinent to sex as well.

563
00:44:02,914 --> 00:44:13,680
Scott: Not just masturbation Yeah, when if you want to make someone feel good during sex make that happen to them You know make it so they don't finish and you just keep holding out all that on and explode.

564
00:44:14,121 --> 00:44:20,340
Rym: Yeah, except for the one in wonderful thing that women can have many orgasms as opposed to our one.

565
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:22,474
Rym: Yeah, yeah bastards.

566
00:44:22,796 --> 00:44:36,195
Scott: Yeah alright, so another good thing is The tip is the sensitive area as I assume, you know And the shaft is sensitive but much less sensitive and the balls are nice to play with.

567
00:44:36,275 --> 00:44:41,119
Rym: and well, you know, yeah I think we should go into all the unique techniques that we know.

568
00:44:41,582 --> 00:44:44,718
Scott: Alright, but generally if you go for the tip, you're gonna.

569
00:44:44,919 --> 00:44:48,736
Scott: you know It's like put on the afterburner sort of it so to speak.

570
00:44:49,298 --> 00:44:58,359
Scott: Yes So you gotta you gotta manipulate the throttle properly to stay at the right speed And then you cross the finish line when you know, you're ready.

571
00:44:59,361 --> 00:45:04,140
Rym: Now there were two techniques in particular that I remember from Jack insider that were used to great effect.

572
00:45:04,341 --> 00:45:08,135
Rym: One was the rosy palm, which honestly I use to this day.

573
00:45:08,155 --> 00:45:09,520
Scott: The rosy palms a good one.

574
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,327
Scott: I use it a few times.

575
00:45:11,448 --> 00:45:19,160
Rym: the basic of the rosy palm is that you masturbate as normal One-handed, however, you avoid the tip and the most sensitive parts.

576
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:22,659
Rym: But you generally masturbate when you're getting close and you're getting near the end.

577
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:33,600
Rym: And once you cross the line because guys know this girls may not men have a line There is an a dead exact line and we know the exact instance that we cross it.

578
00:45:34,266 --> 00:45:35,519
Rym: It is the line of no return.

579
00:45:36,202 --> 00:45:46,763
Rym: once you cross that line one you were done sexually for at least a few minutes after that because you're Something's going to happen - you're going you you're going to have your orgasm No matter what.

580
00:45:46,925 --> 00:45:48,817
Scott: you can't prevent it and hold out any longer.

581
00:45:48,877 --> 00:45:49,199
Scott: you're done.

582
00:45:49,681 --> 00:45:52,070
Scott: Now the problem is pink in the hose has been let go.

583
00:45:52,732 --> 00:45:57,500
Rym: the best analogy I come up with for the line is Landing a jet on an aircraft carrier.

584
00:45:58,402 --> 00:46:02,240
Rym: Now landing a jet normally you throttle down you slow down you come into a nice landing.

585
00:46:03,182 --> 00:46:09,487
Rym: If you're landing a jet on an aircraft carrier, you have to come in at full throttle Full full throttle.

586
00:46:09,728 --> 00:46:12,060
Rym: if you let off on the throttle, you're probably going to die.

587
00:46:13,042 --> 00:46:20,314
Rym: Now when it comes to masturbation if you let up at all Once you've crossed that line the orgasm is gonna be so unsatisfying.

588
00:46:20,354 --> 00:46:21,980
Rym: You might as well have not even masturbated.

589
00:46:22,046 --> 00:46:22,134
Rym: Yeah

590
00:46:22,284 --> 00:46:27,977
Scott: basically all feeling will immediately evaporate and the stuff will come out really weekly and you'll be done and

591
00:46:27,997 --> 00:46:28,960
Rym: you'll feel kind of a

592
00:46:29,501 --> 00:46:36,934
Scott: Yeah, like you won't feel like because when you you jerk it you sort of have this tension that builds up and then the release is the great part.

593
00:46:37,276 --> 00:46:45,314
Scott: if you don't release properly then this does remaining tension and Like some of the goop might not even make it all the way out.

594
00:46:45,374 --> 00:46:46,580
Scott: you have to pee it out or something.

595
00:46:46,781 --> 00:46:48,272
Scott: Yeah, and that's that's terrible.

596
00:46:48,413 --> 00:46:49,299
Scott: Don't even try it.

597
00:46:49,541 --> 00:46:56,163
Rym: So I guess this also applies to sex in that once you get to that point Don't back off.

598
00:46:56,464 --> 00:46:57,126
Rym: Don't stop.

599
00:46:57,829 --> 00:46:59,193
Rym: You must finish it to the end.

600
00:46:59,273 --> 00:47:04,806
Rym: now this creates interesting situations when say Someone's knocking on your door at the exact wrong moment.

601
00:47:04,926 --> 00:47:07,451
Rym: Yes, because you really have no choice but to finish up.

602
00:47:08,734 --> 00:47:12,307
Scott: I Let go.

603
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,008
Scott: Then yeah, then I realized wait a minute.

604
00:47:16,169 --> 00:47:17,192
Scott: who says I had to let go.

605
00:47:17,433 --> 00:47:24,760
Scott: you get to the line and you just go at It more than ever and you just you're over the line and you can keep running and running and running for five minutes.

606
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,955
Scott: You can't turn around but you can keep going.

607
00:47:27,298 --> 00:47:36,667
Rym: Yep Now the rosy palm technique is that you're doing the normal masturbation and you're avoiding the tip and right when you're about to hit the line Especially right when you hit the line.

608
00:47:37,049 --> 00:47:40,949
Rym: now, I'm assuming you're right-handed your right hand Wow, we're going into great detail.

609
00:47:40,989 --> 00:47:47,703
Rym: here is gripping the shaft The in a in a in a in a grip type fashion like you're holding a staff Mm-hmm.

610
00:47:47,884 --> 00:48:01,639
Rym: I like how I use staff as opposed to stick or penis and then the left hand you take the palm and you put it over end of the penis and just kind of Rub the palm and kind of need yourself into it and finish yourself off all at once.

611
00:48:02,263 --> 00:48:03,167
Scott: Yeah, you got to watch out.

612
00:48:03,268 --> 00:48:05,680
Scott: one thing with the rosy palm is you don't want to get the goop on your hand.

613
00:48:05,981 --> 00:48:09,520
Scott: Well, you're gonna get it on a head anyway, but you could but you do it properly.

614
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:12,392
Scott: Yeah, but you don't want someone to catch you with goop on your hand.

615
00:48:12,733 --> 00:48:14,300
Rym: Yeah, make sure you can wash your hand.

616
00:48:14,481 --> 00:48:17,933
Rym: You don't want to start the rosy palm until you're over the line or at the line.

617
00:48:18,034 --> 00:48:19,820
Rym: Otherwise, you're just going to hurt your penis.

618
00:48:20,821 --> 00:48:21,806
Scott: Yeah, that's one thing.

619
00:48:22,529 --> 00:48:27,452
Scott: if you can't get some sort of lubrication or whatever You have to be really careful not to chafe your penis.

620
00:48:27,834 --> 00:48:34,890
Scott: at least once in my life I've chafed some skin off and I got like a red Sort of mark and it hurts to touch it there.

621
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:39,386
Scott: and then you can't jerk it because if you do it hurts Because you scraped your skin off.

622
00:48:39,486 --> 00:48:44,936
Rym: that only happened to me once and that was after I ran like two or three miles one day in silk boxers.

623
00:48:46,081 --> 00:48:49,059
Rym: Don't ask me why I don't know what I was thinking.

624
00:48:49,862 --> 00:48:57,809
Scott: So you got to be real careful if you start to like burn the flesh off of your wiener stop Or get some sort of goop or something.

625
00:48:58,130 --> 00:48:59,235
Rym: Now the chopsticks method.

626
00:48:59,255 --> 00:49:02,105
Rym: I was also very fond of Basically, this is very simple.

627
00:49:02,145 --> 00:49:09,560
Rym: You take your two fingers like you're making a peace sign or a V sign and You just put it on either side and just kind of go up and down.

628
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:12,800
Rym: But the rule is you can never use anything other than the middle of those two fingers.

629
00:49:13,721 --> 00:49:13,842
Rym: Mm-hmm.

630
00:49:14,124 --> 00:49:21,151
Rym: It makes a very slow leisurely yet strangely powerful Session to use the term session.

631
00:49:21,977 --> 00:49:27,700
Scott: Yeah You know, generally what I do is, you know, you start out slowly like, you know little chopsticks going.

632
00:49:29,785 --> 00:49:30,698
Rym: Why that song?

633
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,846
Rym: I don't know All.

634
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:35,537
Rym: I thought I just pictured clowns and that's not what I want to picture.

635
00:49:35,737 --> 00:49:36,360
Scott: No, it's not.

636
00:49:36,661 --> 00:49:37,564
Rym: I don't like clowns.

637
00:49:37,705 --> 00:49:41,700
Scott: but then you know, you go a little faster, you know a little more contact.

638
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:49,088
Scott: I mean, it's a you know little curve exponential growth Log arithmetic, I guess not like really.

639
00:49:49,128 --> 00:49:51,817
Rym: Yeah math get it log arithmetic.

640
00:49:52,358 --> 00:49:59,257
Scott: Oh Okay The other method that was in jack and cider that caught our attention, but I've never tried it.

641
00:49:59,277 --> 00:50:00,040
Scott: you ever tried the banana?

642
00:50:00,684 --> 00:50:03,019
Rym: I'd like to say yeah, I did but no I really didn't.

643
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:09,200
Scott: Okay So I'm gonna describe the banana But I cannot attest to the quality of the banana because I've never done it and rims never done it.

644
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:19,927
Rym: We will say however that the people who responded because jack and cider had forums and all sorts of things the response was Overwhelmingly enthusiastic to this method.

645
00:50:20,008 --> 00:50:22,980
Rym: many described it as perhaps perfection in masturbation.

646
00:50:24,201 --> 00:50:32,460
Scott: And as soon as you hear the method if you're a guy, I'm sure you can Imagine what it will feel like and it'll probably feel really good.

647
00:50:32,781 --> 00:50:34,389
Rym: So do you want to describe the method?

648
00:50:34,951 --> 00:50:36,780
Scott: you take a banana a banana?

649
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:41,435
Scott: Hopefully that is larger than your penis if you cannot find one.

650
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:42,879
Rym: I don't know what to say to you.

651
00:50:43,262 --> 00:50:44,372
Scott: Yeah, get a plantain.

652
00:50:44,433 --> 00:50:44,776
Scott: I don't know.

653
00:50:48,402 --> 00:50:51,180
Rym: See the problem I had is that it's really difficult to import girls to me.

654
00:50:51,261 --> 00:50:55,065
Rym: Yeah Yeah, we made a joke.

655
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:57,450
Scott: we're gonna do an episode about bananas we're not joking?

656
00:50:57,851 --> 00:51:00,718
Scott: yeah, really okay, so take the banana.

657
00:51:01,439 --> 00:51:06,407
Scott: cut microwave the banana for like Five seconds ten seconds.

658
00:51:06,447 --> 00:51:08,133
Rym: Yeah, 30 most don't make it hot.

659
00:51:08,313 --> 00:51:10,200
Rym: Don't burn yourself for the love of God.

660
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,353
Scott: Yeah, make the banana warm and mushy.

661
00:51:13,198 --> 00:51:16,519
Scott: now Chop the end off the banana like you're circumcising it.

662
00:51:18,064 --> 00:51:21,632
Scott: Then you want to chop up the end that has the little twig guy on it.

663
00:51:21,873 --> 00:51:27,027
Scott: obviously stem chop it off then Don't break the banana peel apart.

664
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:31,120
Scott: Just squeeze all the banana fruit out of it.

665
00:51:31,501 --> 00:51:34,980
Scott: You know sort of like you squeezing the toothpaste out of a tube of toothpaste, right?

666
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:47,195
Scott: Take the remaining intact peel and you now have a warm and squishy synthetic fruit based vagina have at it.

667
00:51:48,661 --> 00:51:49,725
Rym: I'm not you normally.

668
00:51:49,785 --> 00:51:52,033
Rym: I always ask our listeners when we talk about something.

669
00:51:52,053 --> 00:51:56,425
Rym: We haven't tried to try it out and let us know I can't recommend you try this.

670
00:51:56,726 --> 00:52:04,539
Rym: no however if anyone is if anyone has already tried this for whatever reason Feel free to I don't know.

671
00:52:05,363 --> 00:52:11,958
Rym: Tell us how well it works Maybe in the forums, but don't bring anything horrible into my forums, please.

672
00:52:12,259 --> 00:52:18,150
Scott: yeah I'm telling you I don't recommend you do it, but if you do do it Against my recommendation.

673
00:52:18,211 --> 00:52:19,137
Scott: I would like to hear about it.

674
00:52:20,801 --> 00:52:21,986
Rym: That's probably the best way to put it.

675
00:52:22,588 --> 00:52:25,760
Scott: Yeah, and I feel really bad for the banana.

676
00:52:26,322 --> 00:52:30,300
Scott: So make a banana bread out of the fruit that is untarnished.

677
00:52:31,262 --> 00:52:35,543
Rym: Now in terms of lubrication a lot of people use baby oil works really well baby I was good.

678
00:52:36,187 --> 00:52:39,144
Rym: if you have any astroglide works Fantastically.

679
00:52:39,265 --> 00:52:47,392
Rym: however it has the distinctive smell - it makes a mess Yes, so only use a more advanced lubrication.

680
00:52:47,412 --> 00:52:48,555
Scott: You know like Ky.

681
00:52:48,595 --> 00:52:50,059
Scott: Which is designed for this sort of thing.

682
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:56,020
Scott: if You can clean it up, and you know you're prepared like it's gonna be a big production.

683
00:52:57,142 --> 00:52:59,278
Scott: You don't want to use it for like a quick one-off here and there.

684
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:02,617
Rym: yeah You save this for the special occasions like the fine wine.

685
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:09,212
Scott: yeah Do not ever think.

686
00:53:09,373 --> 00:53:10,899
Scott: okay, I had a friend is a true story.

687
00:53:12,836 --> 00:53:16,715
Scott: He He was in a locker room after a sport a school sport.

688
00:53:16,775 --> 00:53:17,337
Scott: I think it was track.

689
00:53:17,438 --> 00:53:19,415
Rym: Oh god I remember this story.

690
00:53:19,617 --> 00:53:19,799
Scott: any.

691
00:53:20,742 --> 00:53:21,184
Scott: He had some.

692
00:53:21,385 --> 00:53:22,933
Scott: you know Ben gay I see hot.

693
00:53:22,973 --> 00:53:26,589
Scott: it was actually I see hot in this case But Ben gay and other similar products.

694
00:53:27,212 --> 00:53:28,156
Scott: They're all the same.

695
00:53:28,176 --> 00:53:29,160
Scott: I think you know where this is going.

696
00:53:30,444 --> 00:53:44,751
Scott: Now if you don't know about these products They're basically ointments which are supposed to like ease like strained muscles after intense physical exertion and They generally like they're hot.

697
00:53:44,892 --> 00:53:51,360
Scott: like you if you put Ben gay on your arm It'll sort of sting and make it really warm and relax your muscle over there.

698
00:53:51,842 --> 00:53:55,499
Scott: Like if you put Ben gay on someone's nose their nose will hurt like ow.

699
00:53:56,703 --> 00:54:04,889
Scott: So this guy had some icy hot and he thought hmm icy cool refreshing hot warm tingly sensational.

700
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:10,272
Scott: I Think I'll take a big wad of this and put it on my balls.

701
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:15,729
Rym: if you can't guess what happened Go try it go nuts.

702
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:16,131
Rym: No.

703
00:54:16,151 --> 00:54:17,820
Scott: This is something you really don't want to do.

704
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,064
Scott: I recommend the banana.

705
00:54:19,104 --> 00:54:24,279
Scott: before recommending this he lost like a layer of skin from his scrotum just came off.

706
00:54:24,802 --> 00:54:26,252
Scott: He was screaming and up like.

707
00:54:26,655 --> 00:54:27,380
Scott: it's terrible.

708
00:54:28,102 --> 00:54:34,080
Scott: Yeah, take sure that when you choose a lubrication you choose something that is not going to harm you physically.

709
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:39,220
Rym: Let me put it this way if you ever decide to do something that you and any point think wait a minute.

710
00:54:39,362 --> 00:54:40,359
Rym: This might be dangerous.

711
00:54:40,821 --> 00:54:41,223
Scott: Don't do it.

712
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:46,180
Rym: No Google for it because someone else already did it and wrote an entire site about why you shouldn't do it.

713
00:54:46,723 --> 00:54:48,997
Scott: Uh, a good tool is an ice cube.

714
00:54:49,078 --> 00:54:49,420
Scott: actually.

715
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:53,773
Rym: Actually ice is very useful in a number of bits of play.

716
00:54:54,094 --> 00:54:55,420
Scott: Yeah, go ice.

717
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,449
Rym: Yes, be careful with ice as usual.

718
00:54:58,630 --> 00:54:59,694
Scott: We're not talking about icy hot now.

719
00:54:59,714 --> 00:55:01,120
Scott: We're talking about actual ice cubes.

720
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:07,119
Rym: Yes, a single ice cube can be used to great effect because hot cold is not a stimulation you would normally get from.

721
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:08,410
Rym: you know Your right hand.

722
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,278
Rym: Mm-hmm.

723
00:55:09,801 --> 00:55:11,448
Scott: So like, you know, you're getting pretty close.

724
00:55:11,729 --> 00:55:13,355
Scott: Just drop an ice cube on there.

725
00:55:13,475 --> 00:55:18,720
Scott: rub an ice cube around Maybe a little on the tip or something, you know, and then whoo you can get somewhere.

726
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,026
Scott: But of course watch out.

727
00:55:20,046 --> 00:55:23,000
Scott: remember what I said about water before that ice cube melts on there.

728
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:24,546
Scott: You could be heading to chafe city.

729
00:55:24,887 --> 00:55:33,356
Rym: Yep any other Excellent techniques that we run out of things to talk about in regards to masturbation.

730
00:55:33,737 --> 00:55:34,440
Scott: I don't think we did.

731
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,609
Scott: I just think they're not coming to mind right now.

732
00:55:36,629 --> 00:55:37,191
Scott: Yeah.

733
00:55:37,211 --> 00:55:42,489
Rym: Well, we've talked for over 45 minutes Entirely on the topic of male masturbation.

734
00:55:43,091 --> 00:55:43,412
Rym: awesome.

735
00:55:43,813 --> 00:55:47,569
Rym: I think that's a new internet low though I know it's not because I've read websites.

736
00:55:47,609 --> 00:55:50,040
Scott: I'm sure there are other podcasts already discussing this topic.

737
00:55:50,823 --> 00:55:53,051
Scott: I just haven't found any of them or search for any of them.

738
00:55:54,215 --> 00:55:55,680
Rym: I like how you had to add that second part.

739
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:03,340
Scott: Yeah, it's like You haven't found any because not having found any and searching is something different from not finding and not searching.

740
00:56:03,581 --> 00:56:07,074
Rym: But I guess my final thoughts here would be simply that everyone does it.

741
00:56:07,496 --> 00:56:09,985
Rym: It's perfectly natural Go nuts.

742
00:56:10,065 --> 00:56:11,108
Rym: Have at and have fun.

743
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:14,038
Rym: Yeah, however, do not be the guy who?

744
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,398
Rym: Masturbates to the exclusion of I don't know the rest of your life.

745
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:26,020
Scott: yeah, and If someone else is doing it don't get all a yeah, let him masturbate.

746
00:56:27,242 --> 00:56:28,878
Scott: Be free feel good.

747
00:56:30,901 --> 00:56:33,854
Rym: And thus concludes the first controversial episode of GeekNights.

Scott: It seemed like everyone wanted to hear it.

750
00:56:36,509 --> 00:56:38,259
Scott: Kind of actually would mean that someone was against it.

00:56:38,781 --> 00:56:39,905
Rym: I'm sure there are people against it.
