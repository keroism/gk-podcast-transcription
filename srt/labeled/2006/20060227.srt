00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,201
Rym: It's Monday February 27th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,582 --> 00:00:17,819
Rym: Tonight with our new dynamic range compressor, we talk about Listile.

3
00:00:18,322 --> 00:00:19,349
Scott: Let's do this!

4
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:27,012
Rym: So sitting here in front of me is a shiny metal blue new piece of equipment that I've been fiddling with for the last several hours.

5
00:00:27,514 --> 00:00:31,589
Scott: And he'll probably continue to fiddle with it forever and ever and ever unless I stop him.

6
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:36,770
Scott: And if he ever stops, all I have to do is get him another box with some lights on it and some knobblies.

7
00:00:37,313 --> 00:00:39,408
Rym: It's got lights, and I can fiddle with it.

8
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:53,510
Scott: I'm telling you, if they just made boxes with like a bunch of different colored LEDs and like knobs that you turned that modified the illumination of those LEDs, Rym would sit there forever just playing with those knobs.

9
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,710
Rym: Well, see actually these LEDs actually do do something.

10
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:10,270
Rym: I mean, it's a compressor, and it gives me all the levels and tells me how much it's compressing the audio, and for the next two weeks at least, to vary slightly so from episode to episode as I tune.

11
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:17,277
Rym: I mean, I'm using one of the preset values on this thing now, and I did a rudimentary leveling before I did it all.

12
00:01:17,317 --> 00:01:19,709
Rym: Scott was actually yelling at me for taking too long to do it.

13
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:21,350
Rym: But I'll fill some more later.

14
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:25,270
Scott: If anyone can tell the difference in a double-blind hearing test, I'll give you money.

15
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,018
Rym: Well, they'll be able to tell some obvious differences.

16
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,270
Rym: Like if one of us is a lot louder than the other person or anything.

17
00:01:31,771 --> 00:01:38,810
Scott: I meant between, like, you know, not between now and before, but between like today and tomorrow and the next day and the next day.

18
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:48,169
Rym: I can think of one thing that'll probably change significantly, and that's gonna be the amount of noise, which will take me a while to hammer out.

19
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,829
Rym: Because, I mean, we've asked so many times for audio, for feedback on the audio, how good it is.

20
00:01:53,490 --> 00:02:00,270
Rym: Only one person has ever actually given us any useful feedback when they said that it sounds like ass in their car.

21
00:02:00,674 --> 00:02:02,029
Scott: It sounds like ass in my car, too.

22
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:08,869
Rym: Yep, so we discovered that it does indeed sound like ass in a car, and we knew exactly why, and that's why I got this shiny piece of equipment in front of me.

23
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:09,690
Rym: Mmm.

24
00:02:09,971 --> 00:02:15,510
Rym: So, I won't talk about it anymore until eventually I do that show I keep talking about on how we do the podcast.

25
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,629
Scott: But now I have to suffer him sitting in here going, "Ah, ah, ah,

26
00:02:20,649 --> 00:02:20,709
Scott: ah!".

27
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,214
Rym: Yeah, for the last hour.

28
00:02:22,234 --> 00:02:23,759
Scott: While twiddling with knobs.

29
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:27,450
Rym: I didn't have any good source of audio.

30
00:02:27,571 --> 00:02:30,570
Rym: I basically need a recording of myself yelling to make this easier.

31
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:35,730
Rym: So I would sit here, and I yell into the microphone watching levels, fiddle with the knob, and then yell again.

32
00:02:36,371 --> 00:02:37,850
Rym: And Scott in the other room had to listen to that.

33
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,729
Scott: We should have a betting pool of when he'll stop fiddling with the knobs.

34
00:02:42,611 --> 00:02:45,810
Rym: I'll bet on myself that within two weeks, I'll be done fiddling.

35
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,350
Scott: Then I'll just get you, and I'll just move one of the knobs, and then you'll sit there for another two weeks.

36
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:55,050
Rym: Yeah, you see, the knobs all have numbers on them, so I could just move it back.

37
00:02:55,931 --> 00:02:59,953
Scott: Some of them are sort of gradual with, you know, not very... You know what?

38
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:01,629
Rym: I'll make a mark on it with a sharpie.

39
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:03,789
Scott: I'll erase it and move it up.

40
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,109
Rym: You can't erase a sharpie mark.

41
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,129
Scott: Oh, yeah, you can.

42
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,110
Rym: Yeah, what's... you gonna get some butane?

43
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:09,422
Scott: I've done it.

44
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:11,356
Scott: Before.

45
00:03:13,712 --> 00:03:26,169
Rym: All right, so anyway, in the news, our good friends Diebold, you know, the people who made the cheating, broken, fake voting machines that barely work and are crappy, and Scott and I could have made a better voting machine in our spare time.

46
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:33,290
Scott: Well, the thing is, there's one thing that Diebold does very well, and that is make boxes and things that are hard to open.

47
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:38,609
Scott: You know, like a box that you put an ATM machine in, or a box you put your money in.

48
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,250
Rym: I mean, the lock boxes they make, you're not gonna get into them easy, and if you do, it's tamper-evident.

49
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,089
Rym: They do a good job at that.

50
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:51,659
Scott: Yep, they make big, heavy, metal boxes with latches and locks and keys and fireproof and...

51
00:03:52,351 --> 00:04:03,790
Rym: I think the problem is that they hired all these coders to write the stuff for their voting machines, but the people in charge of the companies are thinking of these things like they're still just a big, solid, lock box kind of deal.

52
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:11,279
Scott: Well, they made the box really well, but they need a little voting machine to go in the box, and they hired someone to write software for a voting machine.

53
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:17,103
Scott: Now, I don't know about you, but I can get CS1 students to write a voting program that works.

54
00:04:17,164 --> 00:04:18,269
Scott: You have two buttons.

55
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,060
Scott: If you click one, one number goes up.

56
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,789
Scott: If you click the other one, the other number goes up.

57
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:28,210
Scott: And you store those numbers in memory, and then when someone types the secret code or pushes the third button, the numbers appear.

58
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,011
Rym: Oh, you know what?

59
00:04:29,413 --> 00:04:35,170
Rym: Also, to add the paper trail, just everything cats out to, you know, a little printer somewhere, a little serial printer.

60
00:04:35,611 --> 00:04:35,792
Scott: Yep.

61
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:37,458
Rym: Just with that long ribbon of paper.

62
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:38,422
Scott: Like a little receipt printer.

63
00:04:38,603 --> 00:04:39,105
Rym: Something like that.

64
00:04:39,205 --> 00:04:40,390
Scott: And then someone reloads the paper.

65
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:41,863
Rym: See, I'm not even CS.

66
00:04:41,944 --> 00:04:42,309
Rym: I'm IT.

67
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:49,370
Rym: I learned in school, when I went to RIT, the language that IT people use for most of their classes was Visual Fucking Basic.

68
00:04:50,052 --> 00:04:51,330
Rym: And I could have written- Which is pretty useless.

69
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,870
Rym: Yeah, but I could have written a better voting machine than D-Bolton.

70
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:57,430
Scott: Oh, in Visual Basic, you can write a voting machine program in five minutes.

71
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:01,270
Scott: In fact, I can teach someone who doesn't- who never programmed a computer in their lives.

72
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:06,838
Scott: You had to have used a computer in your life, because I can't teach how to use the mouse and keyboard, but- Well, he could, but he wouldn't.

73
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,149
Rym: He'd just get too pissed at you.

74
00:05:08,713 --> 00:05:15,190
Scott: Yeah, but if you knew how to use a mouse and a keyboard, I could teach you to write a voting machine program in five minutes with Visual Basic.

75
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:21,830
Rym: So we're not going to get into the whole thing about what D-Bolton did and why they're evil, but everyone knows that they're pretty much a bad company.

76
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,730
Rym: There's a chance that they might have tried to rig elections, whatever.

77
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:29,809
Rym: But the point is, our government has been kind of standing by them and using them.

78
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:35,329
Rym: Well, a while ago, a guy named Stefan Heller, who worked for them, or worked for some- His name's Heller.

79
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,470
Rym: Huh, yeah, Heller.

80
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:37,395
Scott: That can't be bad.

81
00:05:37,435 --> 00:05:38,722
Scott: His name be- I mean, it can't be good.

82
00:05:38,762 --> 00:05:39,365
Scott: His name begins with

83
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:39,607
Scott: "hell.".

84
00:05:40,595 --> 00:05:41,002
Scott: It's like, "bad

85
00:05:41,023 --> 00:05:41,328
Scott: guy.".

86
00:05:41,511 --> 00:05:42,249
Rym: That wasn't funny.

87
00:05:44,193 --> 00:05:46,990
Scott: It's like the mark of a bad guy when his name has something bad in it.

88
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:51,847
Scott: Like, if his name was, like, Joe Satanor, it's like,

89
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:52,369
Scott: "alright.".

90
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:53,655
Rym: Alright, tell you what.

91
00:05:54,198 --> 00:05:59,610
Rym: If anyone out there listening is named Joe Satanor, I'd like you to come in and talk to us, 'cause I bet you're not a bad guy.

92
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,548
Scott: Joey Jojo Shevadoo.

93
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:02,397
Rym: Yeah.

94
00:06:03,092 --> 00:06:03,328
Rym: Alright.

95
00:06:03,892 --> 00:06:04,910
Scott: It's a waste name, I have a hood.

96
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:10,630
Rym: This guy, I'm not gonna tell you the whole story, because you can read the link I put on the website.

97
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:26,810
Rym: And if you're not going to the website, and you haven't been to our website, I'll point out that we have links to everything we talk about, so if we talk about something and you don't know what the hell it is, or it's just we talk about it in too vague or too whatever, there's a link there that'll explain it in great detail.

98
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:32,710
Scott: Yeah, if you're one of those people who found us on iTunes or something, and you subscribe and you never go to the website, go there.

99
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:33,909
Rym: Yeah, there's stuff.

100
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,168
Scott: FrontRowCrew.com.

101
00:06:37,593 --> 00:06:37,889
Rym: Yeah.

102
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,990
Scott: You can throw a www at the beginning, that's probably a good idea.

103
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:41,790
Scott: I don't know.

104
00:06:42,232 --> 00:06:43,610
Scott: It's not necessary, but it's good.

105
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,370
Rym: It's unnecessary for now, 'cause we only have one server, but someday.

106
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,160
Scott: Yeah.

107
00:06:49,011 --> 00:06:52,989
Rym: But anyway, I'm gonna skip all the long story, you know, reading the article to you.

108
00:06:53,450 --> 00:07:08,150
Rym: But basically this dude found some documents within Diebold that basically explained that they knew their voting machines were crappy, that they weren't certified, that it was illegal to use 'em, but they were gonna use 'em anyway, and all sorts of just damning, incriminating evidence.

109
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:08,989
Scott: Alright, now here's the thing.

110
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,690
Scott: When you're a company and you do so-- alright, so you're a company.

111
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,208
Scott: You decide to do something bad.

112
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:17,930
Scott: Why do you write down that you did a bad thing on any document ever?

113
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,910
Rym: Yeah, alright, Scott, pretend you're my secretary and I'm the high-ranking CEO.

114
00:07:21,312 --> 00:07:21,550
Rym: Okay.

115
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,130
Rym: Uh, secretary, I'd like to take a dictation.

116
00:07:23,578 --> 00:07:23,790
Rym: Okay.

117
00:07:23,932 --> 00:07:24,349
Rym: Alright, begin.

118
00:07:24,991 --> 00:07:27,164
Rym: I am an evil fuck and I just stole $10,000 from the company.

119
00:07:28,673 --> 00:07:29,530
Rym: I then killed a baby.

120
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:31,670
Rym: Alright, that sounds good.

121
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,290
Rym: Uh, yeah, print that and hide it somewhere.

122
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,250
Rym: I mean, what the hell are they thinking?

123
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:37,187
Scott: I don't know.

124
00:07:37,652 --> 00:07:38,026
Scott: I don't get it.

125
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:41,090
Scott: I never understood this-- this, like, they had to destroy documents.

126
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:42,810
Scott: Why did they create documents?

127
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:47,630
Scott: Well, I mean-- And if you create a document and you did something bad, you don't write it in the document.

128
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:51,810
Scott: It's, you know, it may be you're forced to write certain documents for accounting or something.

129
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,449
Scott: Write down that you did a good thing.

130
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,368
Scott: Write down that you did what you're supposed to do.

131
00:07:57,056 --> 00:07:57,569
Scott: Just lie.

132
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,410
Scott: Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie.

133
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,369
Rym: Well, I guess there is precedent for this.

134
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:10,750
Rym: I'm gonna godwin our own podcast, but if you go back to the Nazis, they wrote down the names of everyone they killed and had these nice little organized "here's everything evil we did" in order.

135
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,309
Rym: Serialized, even.

136
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,770
Rym: Yeah, but the Nazis didn't exp-- you know, they weren't-- They didn't expect to lose.

137
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:21,550
Scott: Yeah, it's like, the Nazis, they were in charge of everything that they were doing.

138
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,130
Scott: There wasn't anyone really above them.

139
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,550
Scott: There was no, like, world leader.

140
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,570
Scott: They were expecting to become the world leader.

141
00:08:27,778 --> 00:08:27,866
Scott: Yeah.

142
00:08:28,031 --> 00:08:29,649
Scott: They were number two, pretty much.

143
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:34,350
Scott: You know, well, actually, they were number one on their own, but everyone else together beat them out.

144
00:08:34,734 --> 00:08:34,830
Scott: Yeah.

145
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:39,409
Scott: Kind of like the US is number one in terms of any country, but all of Europe can kick our ass together.

146
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:40,429
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

147
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:44,550
Scott: So, um, you know, they didn't have-- they didn't answer to anyone.

148
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,850
Scott: They weren't in fear of being caught.

149
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,750
Scott: They were already shooting people.

150
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,010
Rym: I got this question for you.

151
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,290
Rym: If anyone who works at Diebold listens to GeekNights.

152
00:08:53,195 --> 00:08:53,448
Scott: Hahaha.

153
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:53,999
Scott: Lol.

154
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:54,579
Rym: Yeah.

155
00:08:56,031 --> 00:09:00,630
Rym: Um, you're not the Nazis, and there are people who can just come in and read all your stuff.

156
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,090
Scott: And put you all in jail.

157
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,429
Rym: Yeah, but here's the problem.

158
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:08,489
Rym: Here's why this is news, and here's why we're talking about it.

159
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,370
Rym: It's not that he found these documents.

160
00:09:10,572 --> 00:09:11,470
Rym: I just find that amusing.

161
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:18,290
Rym: They are now pressing charges against the dude who found these documents and gave them to the public and gave them to the police.

162
00:09:18,811 --> 00:09:21,830
Rym: Because he got them in a way that might have been illegal.

163
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,870
Scott: But isn't there the whistleblower action?

164
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:24,323
Scott: Yeah.

165
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:29,090
Rym: Now, it's complicated because there are a whole bunch of laws to protect what are called whistleblowers.

166
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,990
Rym: Now, these are people-- these laws were written basically for-- say you work in a factory.

167
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,768
Rym: You're an auto worker.

168
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:39,850
Rym: And there's a machine that just isn't-- like, it isn't safe and it cuts people's hands off.

169
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,730
Scott: And they tell-- Wouldn't there be a lot of workers' comp cases real quick?

170
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:45,189
Rym: Yeah, but say they hush it up.

171
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,510
Rym: Or say, like, they know it's a dangerous situation and they just don't say anything about it.

172
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,188
Scott: And no one gets hurt.

173
00:09:49,498 --> 00:09:49,610
Scott: Yeah.

174
00:09:49,851 --> 00:09:52,090
Rym: Because if someone got hurt, obviously everyone would know about it.

175
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,310
Rym: But say it's illegal.

176
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,370
Rym: Like, it's an illegal machine.

177
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,430
Rym: And it's obviously illegal.

178
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,130
Rym: It doesn't meet OSHA.

179
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,189
Rym: It's a dangerous piece of shit.

180
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:08,206
Rym: And you go to the feds or whoever, whatever, you know, OSHA, let's say, and you tell them, "Hey, Ford or GM or whatever company I work for is doing something dangerous and evil right

181
00:10:08,247 --> 00:10:08,487
Rym: there.".

182
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:15,670
Rym: Now, these laws protect you from being fired or otherwise harassed by the company you're blowing the whistle on.

183
00:10:16,431 --> 00:10:17,469
Rym: Hence, a whistleblower law.

184
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:20,810
Scott: You know, if I did that, I probably wouldn't want to work for that company anymore.

185
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,784
Scott: Or I'd quit and then blow the whistle and quit.

186
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,910
Rym: But let's say the company, like, blacklists you for other companies.

187
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,930
Rym: Or they do some sort of, you know, they try to kill your family, I guess.

188
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:30,324
Rym: I don't know.

189
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:31,768
Rym: Anything they try to do to you.

190
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:35,010
Rym: Or say they try to sue you for defamation or something.

191
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:37,149
Rym: These whistleblower laws can help protect you.

192
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:44,650
Rym: Now, it's a gray area with this guy because he got the documents in an illegal way, technically.

193
00:10:46,491 --> 00:10:54,889
Rym: But he had the documents, and even though he wasn't allowed to disclose them, he decided to for the greater good because the documents document an evil that was done.

194
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,104
Scott: Does he have good lawyers?

195
00:10:57,145 --> 00:10:57,490
Scott: He better.

196
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:03,610
Rym: All I know is that we'll follow up on this because on April 24th, which isn't that far away, he's going to have the first hearing.

197
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:10,546
Scott: Now, if he gets-- I'm sure that there are plenty of lawyers who are awesome who are going to go, "We'll help you for free because

198
00:11:10,566 --> 00:11:10,646
Scott: fair.".

199
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:12,686
Rym: Yeah, I hope so.

200
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:25,050
Rym: Though the thing is, Diebold got screwed over the documents he released, and worst case scenario, say they throw the book at him as hard as they can, he's only up for three years, eight months at most.

201
00:11:26,411 --> 00:11:27,374
Rym: So, I mean, that would suck.

202
00:11:27,414 --> 00:11:33,801
Rym: I'm not going to pretend that a few years in prison is some trifle or something just to be laughed at, but it's not being shot.

203
00:11:33,942 --> 00:11:35,290
Rym: It's not being thrown in jail forever.

204
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:48,650
Rym: If that's the worst Diebold can do to him, and he basically shed light on this huge, horrible conspiracy/evil, I have a lot of respect for this dude, and if he goes to jail, I'll be kind of mad.

205
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,235
Scott: Yeah, that always sucks.

206
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:56,749
Scott: Try to do good, and you get the stick, and the guy's doing bad, they go, "Wee hee

207
00:11:56,769 --> 00:11:56,890
Scott: hee!".

208
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,014
Rym: See, that's the world today.

209
00:11:58,054 --> 00:12:01,630
Rym: There's a stick just waiting to fall on us anytime we try to do anything.

210
00:12:02,512 --> 00:12:05,430
Rym: The man's standing there with the stick, and he's keeping us off his lawn.

211
00:12:07,892 --> 00:12:09,350
Scott: We gotta set fire to his lawn.

212
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:22,690
Scott: A few weeks ago, maybe days ago, I don't know, I wasn't paying attention, but this link appeared to something called origami, which is usually the art of folding paper into cool shapes.

213
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:29,910
Rym: The thing that we're going to talk about, I'd heard of, but I didn't connect that it was called origami.

214
00:12:30,031 --> 00:12:35,416
Rym: I just knew that something like this was coming out, so Scott asked me right before the show, "Hey, want to do the origami

215
00:12:35,436 --> 00:12:35,737
Rym: thing?".

216
00:12:35,878 --> 00:12:36,962
Rym: and I asked, "What?

217
00:12:37,504 --> 00:12:38,428
Rym: What the hell are you talking

218
00:12:38,448 --> 00:12:38,649
Rym: about?".

219
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:48,510
Scott: So it was this website that was really sort of vague about what it was referring to, but somehow, people seemed to get the idea that it was about something really important.

220
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:53,306
Scott: I have the idea that people from origami, or working with origami...

221
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,670
Rym: Wow, we're really dancing around actually saying what it is.

222
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,232
Rym: Yeah, we are.

223
00:12:57,534 --> 00:13:03,129
Scott: That's because I'm trying to give people the feeling of what it was like to see it come out, because they were really dancing around what it was.

224
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:09,884
Rym: Yeah, because once I saw a picture of it, the moment I saw a picture and it all clicked together, I thought, "Wow, that's actually kind of

225
00:13:09,925 --> 00:13:10,126
Rym: cool.".

226
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:15,297
Scott: So, basically, it came out onto the net.

227
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:19,784
Scott: I'm pretty sure, on purpose, they marketed it in an underground fashion on purpose.

228
00:13:24,091 --> 00:13:28,189
Scott: So it looked like bloggers were discovering it, but really, the people were promoting it.

229
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,709
Scott: Anyway, it was pretty much first, it was origami, ooh.

230
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,250
Scott: Then it was, it's Microsoft.

231
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,176
Rym: Gabbo!

232
00:13:36,237 --> 00:13:36,783
Rym: Gabbo!

233
00:13:36,864 --> 00:13:37,228
Rym: Gabbo!

234
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,620
Scott: Ooh, so now everyone's like, "Microsoft?

235
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:41,543
Scott: Origami?

236
00:13:41,563 --> 00:13:42,908
Scott: Hmm, what could it

237
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:43,088
Scott: be?".

238
00:13:43,771 --> 00:13:45,689
Rym: They've got a patent on paper, I'm telling you.

239
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:50,690
Scott: Yeah, so people knew that Microsoft was going to compete with the iPod.

240
00:13:53,274 --> 00:13:54,864
Scott: They were like, "Okay, maybe that's what this

241
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:55,085
Scott: is.".

242
00:13:56,492 --> 00:14:02,570
Scott: And now, what it's looking like right now is, number one, Microsoft is going to do something tomorrow.

243
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:04,094
Scott: For sure.

244
00:14:04,518 --> 00:14:05,930
Scott: They're making some sort of announcement.

245
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:06,791
Rym: All right.

246
00:14:07,154 --> 00:14:09,790
Rym: Well, I guess they're at least going to continue being a monopoly.

247
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,094
Scott: Oh, yeah.

248
00:14:11,315 --> 00:14:14,630
Scott: If you didn't know, Apple is also making an announcement tomorrow.

249
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:15,393
Scott: Ooh.

250
00:14:18,097 --> 00:14:19,689
Rym: See, I'm more interested in the Apple one.

251
00:14:20,233 --> 00:14:26,109
Rym: Even though, I mean, you know, for all the You Heroes, me and Scott arguing, I'm real cynical about gadgets that come out.

252
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:31,468
Rym: Like, I see the new iPod or whatever, and I think, "Wow, that's cool, but screw that, I don't want

253
00:14:31,508 --> 00:14:31,549
Rym: it.".

254
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,210
Rym: But I still think it's cool, so don't get me wrong.

255
00:14:34,551 --> 00:14:37,729
Rym: I'm excited about what Apple's going to announce, but I'm probably not going to buy whatever it is.

256
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:40,301
Scott: Anyway, so everyone is like,

257
00:14:40,321 --> 00:14:40,442
Scott: "Ooh.".

258
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:49,170
Scott: But the latest thing going around the net, and I haven't read enough to be 100% sure, is there's this device.

259
00:14:50,251 --> 00:14:54,570
Scott: And it's like, it's bigger than a PSP, but it didn't seem too thick.

260
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,750
Scott: And the whole thing is like a screen, but there's like a few buttons on the side.

261
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:00,750
Scott: And I think it's a touchscreen.

262
00:15:02,932 --> 00:15:06,849
Scott: And it's a Microsoft device, and it seems to, it's not running Windows CE.

263
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:11,089
Scott: If it's running Windows CE, it's running like a really, really powerful Windows CE.

264
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:12,529
Scott: Like, holy crap.

265
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:19,426
Scott: Because apparently it can do MP3s, and play freaking Halo, and be a PDA, and play videos.

266
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,550
Scott: It's supposed to be freaking everything.

267
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,038
Rym: So yeah, it's basically a handheld device.

268
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,230
Rym: that's kind of between a PSP and a small laptop.

269
00:15:32,251 --> 00:15:35,650
Scott: It's like between a PSP and a tablet PC.

270
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,665
Scott: Think of a tablet PC only weak, but not like the OQO.

271
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,549
Scott: Bigger than that, and not as sucky.

272
00:15:42,111 --> 00:15:48,890
Rym: Now the main thing that got me was that the price point looks like it's going to be significantly under $1,000.

273
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:49,910
Scott: Significantly under $1,000.

274
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,018
Rym: Like they said, $600 to $800 I saw on one site.

275
00:15:53,030 --> 00:16:01,590
Scott: Yeah, if you've seen the Nokia something 700 or whatever, it's like this Linux tablet thing that's meant for your living room.

276
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,930
Scott: Like you can browse the web on it, and you can IM on it, and it has a touchscreen, and Nokia makes it.

277
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,010
Scott: The people who make those cellphones.

278
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:11,149
Rym: Yeah, we kind of want one to be like a semi-remote control, but that's us.

279
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:18,930
Scott: Well actually, there's another device I forgot the name of, but I've seen it and used it, that's actually better.

280
00:16:19,673 --> 00:16:21,029
Scott: It's a living room Linux thing.

281
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,901
Scott: Oh, I don't know why it can't come to mind.

282
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,690
Scott: I had like a little postcard with an ad board.

283
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:31,665
Rym: Yeah, you've brought it up like three or four times in the past when I'd complain about the wireless keyboard downstairs, and you'd say, "Oh, let's just get a

284
00:16:31,705 --> 00:16:31,988
Rym: blah.".

285
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,910
Scott: Yeah, but the problem is that thing's overpriced.

286
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,431
Scott: If it was like $500, I would get it, but it's like $800.

287
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:42,950
Rym: Yeah, now this thing is $600 to $800, but it has many more functions other than just that.

288
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,750
Scott: Yeah, you could like replace, it's just, I don't know, we'll see what happens.

289
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,948
Scott: I have a feeling it's going to be loaded with mad DRM's.

290
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:53,390
Rym: Yeah, but we'll see if it's loaded with mad crackzzz too.

291
00:16:53,910 --> 00:17:14,030
Scott: Yeah, so keep your eyes wide open for something called Origami from Microsoft, because it might be something that, you know, pushes out the PSP and the iPod a little bit, and possibly even like start pushing on things like trios and, you know, sidekicks and whatnot.

292
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:21,010
Rym: I mean, it definitely completes, it competes with the PSP, I'm pretty sure, because the PSP is not a gaming system anymore.

293
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:23,709
Rym: It's basically an MP3 player and a movie watcher.

294
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,210
Scott: Don't forget ROM player.

295
00:17:25,452 --> 00:17:25,910
Rym: Yeah, ROM player.

296
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,410
Scott: Number one function, it's a ROM player.

297
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:33,770
Rym: Now, yeah, ROM player, I mean, I'm really thinking of getting a PSP once they get cheaper, because I want a ROM player that's portable.

298
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,530
Scott: I think that by the time the PSP is cheap enough to be a ROM player.

299
00:17:37,731 --> 00:17:38,429
Rym: There'll be a ROM player.

300
00:17:38,732 --> 00:17:39,910
Scott: The DS will be a ROM player.

301
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:44,870
Scott: Or you can just buy a ROM player, like a bootleg Chinese thing full of ROMs.

302
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,829
Rym: Yeah, that should exist, and if it doesn't, it will soon.

303
00:17:48,551 --> 00:17:49,288
Scott: I'm pretty sure it does.

304
00:17:49,711 --> 00:17:52,410
Scott: If it doesn't, let's make it and import it illegally.

305
00:18:00,003 --> 00:18:01,259
Rym: So, things of the day.

306
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:09,159
Rym: Now, this isn't the newest thing, because I saw it earlier, but I know that it happened recently, so it can't have been on the internet that long.

307
00:18:09,921 --> 00:18:11,540
Rym: But, Biscuit City.

308
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:19,120
Rym: Someone in London, I think it was a Chinese guy, made a small city, little model of a city, almost entirely out of biscuits.

309
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:24,520
Rym: And by biscuits, I used the British, so really, you know, like little crackers and cookie type things.

310
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:25,799
Scott: All different kinds.

311
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,799
Scott: As opposed to gingerbread and frosting.

312
00:18:28,324 --> 00:18:28,659
Scott: And candy.

313
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:30,679
Rym: So he basically made a Biscuit City.

314
00:18:31,281 --> 00:18:35,020
Rym: I saw some jelly beans in there, I think he used them as water, because they were blue or whatever.

315
00:18:35,661 --> 00:18:37,260
Rym: But, it's kind of cool.

316
00:18:37,622 --> 00:18:43,099
Rym: And the coolest thing was, a bunch of people then came in and were allowed to eat the city, since it was entirely edible, being biscuit.

317
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,791
Scott: Wouldn't you want to keep the city?

318
00:18:44,852 --> 00:18:45,074
Scott: I mean...

319
00:18:45,701 --> 00:18:46,774
Rym: Well, no, it's made of biscuit.

320
00:18:46,815 --> 00:18:47,220
Rym: It would rot.

321
00:18:48,042 --> 00:18:50,179
Scott: But usually when you make a gingerbread house, you don't eat it.

322
00:18:51,284 --> 00:18:52,320
Rym: Ah, I eat gingerbread houses.

323
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,498
Scott: I mean, you make a little one and you eat it, but usually people make them and then they...

324
00:18:57,042 --> 00:18:57,648
Rym: That's stupid!

325
00:18:57,668 --> 00:18:58,900
Rym: Then why make a gingerbread house?

326
00:19:00,082 --> 00:19:04,680
Scott: I remember in elementary school, we would make gingerbread houses, and then we never ate them.

327
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,960
Scott: They always went somewhere, they sat around the room and then they did something with them.

328
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,358
Rym: Yeah, I'd make one and sit around the room for like a week, and then I'd eat it.

329
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,260
Scott: I don't remember ever eating the gingerbread houses.

330
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:20,820
Scott: Although, while we made the gingerbread houses, I partook of much gingerbread... Well, graham crackers and frosting.

331
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,640
Scott: Because it was weird, they always called them gingerbread houses, but you never made them out of gingerbread.

332
00:19:25,863 --> 00:19:26,239
Rym: I did.

333
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,279
Scott: You made them out of graham crackers and frosting.

334
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,000
Scott: Yeah.

335
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,840
Rym: Though the funniest thing is, I don't know why the article went into this much detail.

336
00:19:33,322 --> 00:19:37,620
Rym: But then it talked about how they're providing tea to anyone who wants to eat the biscuit city.

337
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:43,877
Rym: But they said, and they said specifically in the article, "But we don't know what kind of tea they're going to

338
00:19:43,998 --> 00:19:44,239
Rym: offer.".

339
00:19:44,782 --> 00:19:45,639
Rym: Like, that's a big deal.

340
00:19:46,021 --> 00:19:46,545
Scott: It's British.

341
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:48,600
Scott: What do you expect?

342
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,640
Scott: In Britain, the tea is important.

343
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:56,820
Scott: So, um, I don't know how many of you out there are super smart scientists.

344
00:19:58,604 --> 00:20:00,078
Rym: Well, we know at least three of you are.

345
00:20:00,762 --> 00:20:04,019
Scott: Yeah, but I don't think they're quantum physicists-ists.

346
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:11,660
Rym: No, but quantum theory at least is, I mean, I'm not going to claim that I'm an expert by any stretch, but I know a decent bit about it.

347
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,480
Rym: I know more about it than I do about viruses.

348
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,519
Scott: I think there was this great quote I heard once.

349
00:20:16,921 --> 00:20:19,300
Rym: Anyone who claims to understand quantum physics doesn't.

350
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:21,340
Scott: It was something along those lines.

351
00:20:22,261 --> 00:20:28,700
Scott: Like, you know, it was pretty much like no one who claims to understand quantum physics does.

352
00:20:29,804 --> 00:20:32,060
Scott: And, you know, anyone who does doesn't claim.

353
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:37,140
Scott: It was some paradoxical two-sentence thing that pretty much amounted to no one freaking understands quantum physics.

354
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,240
Rym: Yeah, because it really doesn't make a lot of sense.

355
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,482
Scott: Yeah.

356
00:20:40,502 --> 00:20:46,660
Scott: So, um, there is one thing about quantum physics that's pretty much like the fundamental experiment.

357
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:53,180
Scott: The same way that, like, you know, the apple falling in Isaac Newton's head is the fundamental experiment of gravity.

358
00:20:53,760 --> 00:21:05,540
Scott: And Galileo throwing a bowling ball and, like, a pebble out the window of his tower is the fundamental- It's the diffraction grating experiment that shows that electrons behave in strange ways.

359
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,281
Scott: Yeah.

360
00:21:06,863 --> 00:21:22,899
Scott: So I found, by random chance, not minutes ago, this CG video, it's completely computer-generated, of this crazy CG scientist explaining to you this experiment with a very good and graphical demonstration of it.

361
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:29,016
Scott: So, if, you know, what happens often is people will say, "Ooh, this is something quantum!

362
00:21:29,036 --> 00:21:29,819
Scott: Bleh!".

363
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:34,620
Scott: And they just tell you something's quantum and you believe it because you don't understand it for crap.

364
00:21:35,341 --> 00:21:39,880
Scott: If you watch this, maybe you'll have a better idea of what quantum physics is about.

365
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:46,977
Scott: And when people start talking about quantum crap, if they're just making, you know, bullshit up, you'll be like, "Hey, you're just making bullshit

366
00:21:47,077 --> 00:21:47,137
Scott: up.".

367
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,886
Rym: Because quantum theory is mostly math.

368
00:21:50,906 --> 00:21:55,637
Rym: A lot of people like to say things like, "Oh, I understand the theory of quantum blah blah blah.

369
00:21:55,977 --> 00:21:56,659
Rym: I just don't know the

370
00:21:56,699 --> 00:21:57,020
Rym: math.".

371
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,814
Rym: Or, "I like all the theory of physics, but I don't like the

372
00:21:59,854 --> 00:22:00,136
Rym: math.".

373
00:22:01,283 --> 00:22:01,989
Rym: It is the math.

374
00:22:02,191 --> 00:22:03,279
Rym: The math is all that matters.

375
00:22:04,921 --> 00:22:08,268
Scott: Well, it's really that a lot of quantum physics you can't really do.

376
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:13,520
Scott: You just work with numbers and then stuff seems to work out in the numbers and then somehow it matches something.

377
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:25,300
Rym: And then other people can do, but the do is very not... You'd think it'd be interesting to watch, like, a video of scientists doing, like, you know, particle accelerators slam two things together and look at what comes out.

378
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,081
Rym: No.

379
00:22:26,563 --> 00:22:27,607
Rym: No, it's not interesting.

380
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:31,240
Rym: I did a tour of a particle accelerator at a university a long time ago in high school.

381
00:22:32,444 --> 00:22:37,600
Rym: It was cool when they talked about it, but then they showed it to us and the guy went, "Click," and we heard a noise.

382
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:43,488
Rym: And then he said, "That was it.

383
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,357
Rym: Now we spend the next eight hours analyzing the data.

384
00:22:46,618 --> 00:22:47,059
Rym: Are there any

385
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:47,340
Rym: questions?".

386
00:22:49,021 --> 00:22:49,281
Scott: Yup.

387
00:22:50,043 --> 00:22:51,166
Scott: That's pretty much how it goes.

388
00:22:51,206 --> 00:22:55,697
Scott: So here's a video with a crazy scientist and at least the CG guy will entertain you.

389
00:22:56,579 --> 00:22:56,860
Scott: Hopefully.

390
00:22:57,742 --> 00:22:59,353
Rym: So, moving on to the main bit.

391
00:22:59,896 --> 00:23:00,460
Rym: ListAll.

392
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,573
Scott: Alright, so, this is a thing called ListAll.

393
00:23:04,834 --> 00:23:05,376
Scott: L-I-S-T-A-L.

394
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,968
Rym: Not L-I-S-T-A-L-L.

395
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,880
Rym: That will get you a whole bunch of spam crap.

396
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,504
Scott: Yeah, www.listall.com.

397
00:23:14,967 --> 00:23:23,920
Scott: I want to talk about it because I've been using it for a long time and there are not many things that I end up using for quite as long as I use ListAll, so I figure it's worth talking about.

398
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,382
Rym: I'd say so.

399
00:23:25,402 --> 00:23:29,050
Rym: I mean, I don't use it, but I've watched you use it and it's at least interesting.

400
00:23:29,752 --> 00:23:33,100
Rym: And depending on how it goes, I may eventually jump on board.

401
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:37,100
Scott: Yeah, well, I'm going to tell you about all these new features that are reasons that you want to use it.

402
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,200
Rym: So how new are these features?

403
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,625
Scott: This is what this episode is going to be.

404
00:23:39,645 --> 00:23:43,060
Scott: If I can convince Rym to use ListAll, that it's somehow useful to him.

405
00:23:44,661 --> 00:23:51,353
Rym: Basically, if he is not successful in convincing me to use it, that does not mean that you shouldn't.

406
00:23:51,714 --> 00:23:55,120
Rym: Because it is hard as hell to convince me to do just about anything.

407
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,400
Scott: Yeah, because remember, Rym just doesn't care.

408
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,187
Rym: Yeah, I'm still working on that song.

409
00:23:59,247 --> 00:23:59,790
Rym: There's going to be the.

410
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,800
Rym: Rym Doesn't Give a Shit song any week now.

411
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:07,700
Scott: And if anyone can send us a Rym Doesn't Give a Shit song before we make one, we'll compensate you.

412
00:24:07,924 --> 00:24:08,678
Rym: I won't give a shit.

413
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,849
Scott: So, anyway, you know, nowadays there's all kinds of websites that do all sorts of things.

414
00:24:15,889 --> 00:24:23,340
Scott: You know, Flickr does your photos, and Gmail does your mail, and, you know, the bloglines does your feed reading.

415
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,847
Scott: ListAll manages your stuff.

416
00:24:27,811 --> 00:24:30,440
Scott: You know, a lot of people like to make databases of, like, their stuff.

417
00:24:30,982 --> 00:24:36,700
Rym: Yeah, our friend Scott Johnson, way back, always made a database of all the comics he had, and all the comics he needed.

418
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:42,558
Rym: That way, he could just have a little list when he went to conventions, and go through the backorder bins like "blup, blup, blup, blup, blup, I need this

419
00:24:42,719 --> 00:24:42,799
Rym: one.".

420
00:24:43,301 --> 00:24:45,380
Scott: Yep, and then he would check things off and whatever.

421
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,920
Rym: Well, more manga than comics, but yeah, it doesn't matter.

422
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:54,100
Scott: Yeah, but anyway, ListAll can't help you with your comic books, but it can help you with your DVDs.

423
00:24:54,921 --> 00:24:58,076
Scott: That's a problem, because it doesn't do VHS, and it doesn't do anything else.

424
00:24:58,116 --> 00:24:58,820
Scott: It does DVDs.

425
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,362
Scott: Your books.

426
00:25:00,944 --> 00:25:05,200
Scott: This is anything with an ISBN number that is, you know, pretty much anywhere.

427
00:25:05,582 --> 00:25:06,679
Scott: It's books, books, books.

428
00:25:07,501 --> 00:25:07,923
Scott: Music.

429
00:25:08,485 --> 00:25:11,540
Scott: Pretty much music really only encompasses CDs.

430
00:25:12,401 --> 00:25:13,940
Rym: Great, because we own so many CDs.

431
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,490
Scott: I actually don't use the music portion.

432
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:18,980
Scott: I have exactly one thing in the music portion.

433
00:25:19,441 --> 00:25:25,298
Rym: Thing is, we don't need a music portion, because I have ID3s and a giant file system full of MP3s.

434
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:31,220
Scott: And the last thing it lets you keep track of is your video games, which is very, very useful.

435
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:38,833
Scott: So, what ListAll does is you go into it, and you just enter into it, "I own this DVD.

436
00:25:39,074 --> 00:25:39,855
Scott: I own that DVD.

437
00:25:40,076 --> 00:25:40,837
Scott: I own that DVD.

438
00:25:41,158 --> 00:25:41,839
Scott: I own this DVD.

439
00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:42,200
Scott: I own this

440
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:42,380
Scott: book.".

441
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:49,520
Scott: And you can enter things in by ISBN number, by Amazon ID, after you make an account, of course.

442
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,159
Rym: I'll bet if you had a barcode scanner, it'd make it real easy.

443
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:56,920
Scott: Maybe if the barcodes read out the ISBN numbers instead of some SKUs.

444
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,540
Rym: Yeah, even SKUs can usually be used to correlate in some way.

445
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:08,740
Scott: It's actually sort of tedious to enter in all the stuff, you know, into ListAll in the first place.

446
00:26:09,181 --> 00:26:14,360
Scott: Like, it took me a couple hours to enter in all the books I had in my room, you know?

447
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:21,560
Scott: And then, like, I had to keep-- and then, like, I would try to enter in all the DVDs I had, but I had to keep going downstairs to look at them, because I forgot what I had.

448
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,720
Scott: But anyway, eventually, you put-- let's say-- let's just concentrate on the books, because that's what I use the most of.

449
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,851
Scott: It's the same for DVDs, music, and games.

450
00:26:29,373 --> 00:26:30,660
Scott: You know, there's really no difference.

451
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,173
Scott: There's just the four-- there's just four categories.

452
00:26:33,193 --> 00:26:34,240
Scott: they separate your stuff into.

453
00:26:35,201 --> 00:26:42,140
Scott: So in ListAll, you enter in every book you own, and you have a list of every book you own with a nice little picture and everything.

454
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:44,275
Scott: And it tells you who the author is.

455
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:52,300
Scott: Then, you can rate everything you own on a scale of zero-- which means you didn't rate it yet-- to ten stars.

456
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:58,240
Scott: So now, not only do you have a list of everything you own, you have a list of everything you own with a ranking.

457
00:26:58,862 --> 00:27:04,939
Scott: So then you can sort it, showing, like, put my favorite stuff on top, or show me the crap that I own so I know what to get rid of.

458
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,759
Scott: You know, all that sort of thing.

459
00:27:08,203 --> 00:27:09,740
Scott: Then, you can tag stuff.

460
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,966
Scott: So, manga are books.

461
00:27:12,448 --> 00:27:15,280
Scott: I mostly use-- you track, like, manga and trade paperbacks.

462
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:18,120
Scott: You can't use it for comic books, because they don't have ISBN numbers.

463
00:27:18,841 --> 00:27:22,680
Scott: But you can use it for the, you know, collections of comic books and trades, because those are books.

464
00:27:24,422 --> 00:27:27,619
Scott: And you tag it, so I tag all my manga with a manga tag.

465
00:27:28,222 --> 00:27:32,798
Scott: So, then, whenever I want to see a list of all my manga, I just say, "Show me all my

466
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:33,139
Scott: manga!".

467
00:27:33,784 --> 00:27:34,899
Scott: And it makes a list of my manga.

468
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,477
Scott: And you can sort things by the date you added, so, "Show me my recent

469
00:27:39,517 --> 00:27:39,698
Scott: stuff."

470
00:27:40,322 --> 00:27:41,532
Scott: Or, "Show me my favorite

471
00:27:41,552 --> 00:27:41,835
Scott: manga.".

472
00:27:42,865 --> 00:27:44,280
Scott: Now, this is sort of useful.

473
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:49,480
Scott: And, you know, I guess some people would be happy with just that.

474
00:27:50,542 --> 00:27:51,699
Scott: But that's not quite enough.

475
00:27:52,681 --> 00:27:56,080
Scott: So the next thing Listal does is it lets you have a wanted list.

476
00:27:56,902 --> 00:27:59,598
Scott: You go in and you say, "I don't own that, but I want

477
00:27:59,618 --> 00:27:59,658
Scott: it.".

478
00:28:00,081 --> 00:28:01,694
Scott: You say, "I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want

479
00:28:01,734 --> 00:28:01,774
Scott: it.".

480
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:07,120
Scott: So now, for DVDs, books, music, and games, you have an owned list and a wanted list.

481
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:14,840
Scott: And, in the wanted list, you can also rate things on a scale of 1 to 10 stars and tag things and the whole shebang.

482
00:28:15,622 --> 00:28:16,398
Scott: It's just a separate list.

483
00:28:18,261 --> 00:28:29,799
Scott: Oh, I forgot to mention, you can also, in addition to ranking things from 1 to 10 stars, you can say, you know, for books, you can say, "I read the book, I didn't read the book, or I'm currently reading the

484
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:29,940
Scott: book.".

485
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:31,739
Scott: It's sort of useful.

486
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:32,406
Rym: Nah.

487
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,235
Scott: That's why you can say, "Show me my unread

488
00:28:35,275 --> 00:28:35,577
Scott: books."

489
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:40,158
Scott: And you get a list of the books you haven't read yet, and you're like, "Oh, okay, which one am I gonna read

490
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:40,419
Scott: first?".

491
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:45,938
Rym: I'll admit, that is more efficient than my current method of, "There's a pile of books next to my bed, and I'm reading the one on

492
00:28:45,999 --> 00:28:46,239
Rym: top.".

493
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:46,879
Scott: Yeah.

494
00:28:47,981 --> 00:28:50,500
Scott: So, here's, I'm gonna get to the useful stuff now.

495
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,000
Scott: So, currently ListAll is a database, DVDs, books, music, and games.

496
00:28:54,280 --> 00:29:02,200
Rym: Alright, so, so far, in the tally of Rym, uh, it's very interesting, I think it's cool, I think anyone who uses it is pretty cool, but I don't see any reason for me to use it yet.

497
00:29:02,381 --> 00:29:02,900
Scott: Okay, ready?

498
00:29:03,286 --> 00:29:03,519
Scott: Alright.

499
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,079
Scott: Let's start getting into the good stuff.

500
00:29:05,622 --> 00:29:06,258
Rym: Let's do this.

501
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:06,567
Scott: Yeah.

502
00:29:07,741 --> 00:29:12,319
Scott: ListAll, you can, alright, so my account name is A-P-R-E-C-H-E.

503
00:29:13,223 --> 00:29:14,538
Rym: Any of you- And how do you say that?

504
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:15,559
Scott: No one knows.

505
00:29:16,762 --> 00:29:18,955
Scott: You can go to A-P-R-E-C-H-E dot.

506
00:29:18,975 --> 00:29:19,800
Scott: ListAll dot com.

507
00:29:20,004 --> 00:29:20,719
Scott: Go there right now.

508
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:22,220
Scott: I know you're near a computer, probably.

509
00:29:22,462 --> 00:29:22,776
Scott: I don't know.

510
00:29:23,162 --> 00:29:23,555
Scott: You might be.

511
00:29:24,361 --> 00:29:25,619
Scott: And you'll see my stuff.

512
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:32,260
Scott: So now, other people can look at my wanted list, and they can look at the stuff I own, and they can see what I think about it.

513
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,200
Rym: Alright, point the first.

514
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:39,460
Rym: What if you have a lot of porno or something horrible that you want to put in there, but you don't want other people to see it?

515
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,460
Rym: Can you make something private?

516
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:47,740
Scott: You know, I've never even thought about that, but you might be able to, and if not, uh, I'll go ask about that.

517
00:29:48,062 --> 00:29:48,808
Rym: Yeah, I'm just curious.

518
00:29:48,969 --> 00:29:50,359
Rym: It's not a make-or-breaker on this.

519
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:54,659
Scott: Yeah, um, if you have a bunch of porno, you should be showing off that collection, yo.

520
00:29:55,264 --> 00:29:56,160
Rym: Like our friend Dave.

521
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:02,100
Rym: Yeah, you- You got- Alright, should we tell the porno story or save that for a story day?

522
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,340
Scott: We can tell it after I'm done talking about ListAll.

523
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,479
Rym: Eh, let's save it for another day.

524
00:30:06,082 --> 00:30:06,659
Scott: Do whatever you want.

525
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:06,978
Scott: Yeah.

526
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,360
Scott: Okay, so you can show it to your friends.

527
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,600
Scott: That's useful.

528
00:30:11,863 --> 00:30:14,080
Scott: Now, what if your friends join ListAll?

529
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,392
Scott: Well, now you have a whole 'nother?

530
00:30:16,452 --> 00:30:17,759
Scott: load of stuff coming in on you.

531
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:26,840
Scott: You can use ListAll to keep track of what you've loaned to your other ListAll friends and what you've borrowed from your other ListAll friends.

532
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:35,220
Rym: Whoa, whoa, alright, I gotta say, the meter was zero, it's at one now, toward me using this.

533
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:42,340
Rym: Because I can't describe to you the hundreds and hundreds of dollars of books I've lost 'cause I freaking lent it to someone and I forget I even owned it.

534
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,186
Scott: You can also go and look at your friends and say, "Hey, he's got that book that I wanna borrow.

535
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,229
Scott: Request that I can borrow it from

536
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:49,389
Scott: him.".

537
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,168
Scott: And I can say, "Oh, but someone else is currently borrowing it from them.

538
00:31:00,469 --> 00:31:02,895
Scott: And three other people requested to borrow it from them.

539
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,358
Scott: I guess I'm low on the list

540
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:04,819
Scott: waiting.".

541
00:31:05,241 --> 00:31:07,980
Rym: I guess I'd better buy it and then lend it to other people.

542
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,180
Scott: You know, but you put it in your wanted list and maybe someone will notice and buy it for you on your birthday.

543
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:20,080
Scott: So it's really, if all you and all your friends use ListAll and recognize each other as friends, now you're getting into the good stuff.

544
00:31:20,521 --> 00:31:21,420
Rym: Alright, so here's a question.

545
00:31:22,662 --> 00:31:23,406
Rym: I use Netflix.

546
00:31:23,607 --> 00:31:26,200
Rym: I mean, we both use Netflix, but I own the account.

547
00:31:26,982 --> 00:31:29,760
Rym: And I'm the one who sets up the list and I see all our friends.

548
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:38,760
Rym: And by the way, anyone who wants to be a Netflix friend with GeekNights, our house, just send us an email and I'll set all that up offline.

549
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,560
Rym: Because actually a lot of our friends who are doing this with us are seeing awesome movies because we see 'em.

550
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,620
Rym: But anyway, Netflix has two things going for it.

551
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,240
Rym: It has the first thing kind of like just now where it'll show you what all your friends are watching, you can see all your friends have all rated things.

552
00:31:53,101 --> 00:32:01,440
Rym: More importantly, based on what I've seen and what I claim to like, and based on the data it has, it recommends other things that I might like.

553
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,288
Scott: Alright, alright, there is something like that.

554
00:32:04,328 --> 00:32:06,980
Scott: It's not quite as automatic and awesome as Netflix.

555
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,459
Scott: They might be working on something quite like that, but here's what you can do.

556
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:15,151
Scott: If you don't have an item, there are plenty of items.

557
00:32:15,191 --> 00:32:17,740
Scott: This thing pretty much categorizes everything from Amazon.

558
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,448
Scott: It gets most of its data from Amazon.

559
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:22,240
Scott: So that's pretty much a whole shit ton of data.

560
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:29,561
Scott: Now if you don't have something in your collection or your wanted list, you can't rate it on a scale of 1 to 10.

561
00:32:29,561 --> 00:32:33,739
Scott: But you can tag it, or at least you can look at the other things people have tagged it as.

562
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,806
Scott: And you can recommend it to a friend.

563
00:32:36,847 --> 00:32:43,446
Scott: So you can say, you can go looking around for books that you neither own nor want and say, "Oh, Joe might like this.

564
00:32:43,868 --> 00:32:47,078
Scott: Let me recommend this book that I just found to Joey Jojo

565
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:47,439
Scott: Shavadou.".

566
00:32:47,881 --> 00:32:53,880
Rym: Alright, that's kind of cool, because actually I've recommended a movie called City of God to almost everyone on my list and they've all loved it.

567
00:32:54,140 --> 00:33:02,103
Scott: Yeah, so even if you don't own it or want it, you can go in and recommend it and, you know, send it to people and say, "Hey, you might like

568
00:33:02,143 --> 00:33:02,324
Scott: this.".

569
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:06,120
Scott: You can also review and comment on just about anything.

570
00:33:06,782 --> 00:33:15,984
Scott: So if you see a book and you want to say something about it, in addition to tagging it and recommending it to people or not recommending it to people, you can write a little review of it.

571
00:33:16,044 --> 00:33:22,219
Scott: So if something sucks, there really is no option to do an anti-recommendation or a warning, "Don't read

572
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:22,420
Scott: this.".

573
00:33:22,682 --> 00:33:23,399
Rym: They should add that.

574
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,500
Scott: Yeah, but you can do a review saying this and you can rate it in the review.

575
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:27,921
Rym: You know what?

576
00:33:28,162 --> 00:33:34,440
Rym: That's another plus one for me using this, because I'm going to say that I own the Penny Arcade Card Game and then say exactly...

577
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,989
Scott: The Penny Arcade Card Game isn't in here.

578
00:33:36,009 --> 00:33:37,620
Scott: It's not a book, DVD, music, or game.

579
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,640
Rym: But it has an SKU and a serial number.

580
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,979
Scott: It doesn't have an ISBN number.

581
00:33:42,281 --> 00:33:44,560
Scott: It only does DVDs, books, music, and games.

582
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,580
Rym: It's got to do more.

583
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:49,715
Scott: I've asked for VHS, I've asked for comic books, I've asked for board games.

584
00:33:50,036 --> 00:33:50,940
Scott: I can't get those.

585
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:54,020
Rym: I really want board games and... I want games in general.

586
00:33:54,580 --> 00:34:00,442
Scott: Yeah, games is only video games, but it pretty much covers... I haven't been able to not find... Okay, no.

587
00:34:00,683 --> 00:34:02,848
Scott: Actually, it doesn't have old, old video games.

588
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:07,739
Scott: It has Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Game Boy DS...

589
00:34:08,081 --> 00:34:10,460
Rym: Anything I could have bought on Amazon at some point.

590
00:34:11,101 --> 00:34:14,940
Rym: You could never buy old NES games on Amazon back in the day, because it didn't exist.

591
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,520
Scott: Anything that Amazon has ever sold, I think, is in there.

592
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:21,699
Scott: So you got your... I think it has... It doesn't have Super Nintendo, I don't think.

593
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,940
Scott: I think it has N64, PlayStation, and that stuff, and newer.

594
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:25,831
Rym: Uh-huh.

595
00:34:26,703 --> 00:34:27,458
Scott: That's what's in there.

596
00:34:27,821 --> 00:34:33,938
Scott: So, yeah, and there's really no way to add in your own stuff, because that would just screw everything up.

597
00:34:34,683 --> 00:34:35,739
Scott: So, whatever.

598
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:42,320
Scott: You also can't add, like, vinyl records and cassette tapes and VHS, which is... and 8-tracks, which is something that I kind of wanted.

599
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:43,850
Scott: I also have a problem.

600
00:34:43,931 --> 00:34:44,719
Scott: I have a book with no...

601
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,040
Rym: What about my gramophone?

602
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,280
Scott: Yeah, I have a book with no ISBN number on it, and I can't add it to my own list.

603
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:50,956
Scott: What book?

604
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,190
Scott: It's a really old book.

605
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,059
Scott: I bought it at a used bookstore.

606
00:34:54,141 --> 00:34:55,230
Rym: Huh, I got some old books.

607
00:34:55,251 --> 00:34:56,299
Rym: I'll have to see if they're in there.

608
00:34:56,641 --> 00:35:00,680
Scott: Yeah, I mean, this book is real old, like, real tattered and everything.

609
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:08,180
Scott: So... But, okay, now, you can review anything and rank anything, and you can even invite friends to join ListAll.

610
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:13,020
Scott: You can just go into ListAll and type in email addresses, and it'll send, you know, things to people.

611
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,898
Scott: Now, here's... there's two more features of ListAll that are new.

612
00:35:18,201 --> 00:35:21,500
Scott: The thing they just added, at least as far as I know, is the Groups feature.

613
00:35:22,222 --> 00:35:29,420
Scott: I am in the Comics and Manga group, so anyone who enjoys Comics and Manga, whether they're your friend or not, can join any group they want.

614
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:37,079
Scott: So you join the Comics and Manga group, and the Comics and Manga group, it says who started it, when it was started, how many members there are, et cetera, et cetera.

615
00:35:38,061 --> 00:35:45,400
Scott: And there's a forum for each group, so you can talk to other people on ListAll who are in the same group, in a little forum, which is a pretty good forum.

616
00:35:46,821 --> 00:35:51,540
Scott: And, you can recommend things to the group, and get recommendations from the group.

617
00:35:52,780 --> 00:36:02,680
Scott: So, you join groups based on what your general interests are, and then all the people on ListAll who are in those groups are all recommending things to you, and you're recommending things to them.

618
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:10,919
Scott: So, if your friends aren't really recommending a whole lot, you know, you all join the same group, and then, "Oh, look at all this stuff in here that other people say is

619
00:36:10,959 --> 00:36:11,199
Scott: good.".

620
00:36:11,605 --> 00:36:11,935
Rym: Aha!

621
00:36:12,701 --> 00:36:14,125
Scott: Like, "Oh, let's look at the Comics and Manga

622
00:36:14,145 --> 00:36:14,306
Scott: group.".

623
00:36:14,326 --> 00:36:18,700
Scott: Let's see, Watchmen is recommended, Lupin III is recommended.

624
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:27,560
Scott: Let's see, I re- I'm already- I already have or have read one, two, three, four out of the seven recommendations in here.

625
00:36:28,521 --> 00:36:30,520
Scott: There just aren't a lot of people in the group, that's why there aren't.

626
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:50,540
Rym: Yeah, though I gotta say, that was the one thing that made me realize that Netflix's recommending thing was so good, was simply that I put- I started rating movies that I'd watched, and every time I refreshed the page, it recommended basically five movies that I'd already seen and loved, and every time I rated those and refreshed the page, it showed me five more movies that I'd already seen and loved.

627
00:36:51,481 --> 00:36:58,740
Scott: Yeah, that's part of what this does, but I think the other thing is, like, here, look, there's a French film group, it only has one guy in it.

628
00:36:59,124 --> 00:36:59,560
Rym: Oh, great.

629
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:04,840
Scott: But he's recommending three movies here, only one of which I've ever heard of, I've actually seen and heard of.

630
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:05,859
Rym: What, Amélie?

631
00:37:06,162 --> 00:37:06,248
Rym: Yeah.

632
00:37:06,941 --> 00:37:14,740
Scott: But he's got two other ones here, A Very Long Engagement and La Burge Espagnole, the Spanish apartment.

633
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:15,979
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

634
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,302
Scott: So maybe I'll go see those.

635
00:37:17,362 --> 00:37:27,779
Scott: if this guy recommends them, you know, and if I really like French movies and I start to get a lot of them, I'll join the French film group and there's discussions in there and whatever- Discussions, there's one guy.

636
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,139
Scott: Well, you know, eventually there'll be more guys.

637
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,859
Rym: No, just one guy talking to himself.

638
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,700
Scott: The second biggest group is the anime fans group, actually.

639
00:37:36,044 --> 00:37:37,180
Rym: Yeah, didn't see that coming.

640
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,180
Scott: Yeah, were they all recommending anime DVDs to each other?

641
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:40,793
Scott: Hey, someone-

642
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:53,640
Rym: No, honestly, that's a point against for me, I mean, well, not a point against, really, but while I'd love to do something like that, I could really own, I don't own much anime because Netflix, I hate to keep bringing up Netflix, it's just so similar, killed it for me.

643
00:37:54,201 --> 00:37:56,438
Rym: I used to buy a lot of anime because I wanted to see it.

644
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:01,080
Rym: Now, if I want to see an anime, I rent it because that cost me almost nothing.

645
00:38:01,387 --> 00:38:01,580
Rym: Yeah.

646
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,979
Rym: And I buy, like, the fewest of few anime DVDs now.

647
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:25,400
Scott: See, but it's not so much about, you know, part of it is keeping track of the collection of stuff you have, which is, you know, that's pretty much the primary function, but now it seems like, really, those tabs are on the left, and the friends and groups tabs are on the right, so it seems now like it has these two functions that are sorta tied together and sorta not.

648
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:50,080
Scott: Like, your collection is sorta like, now, instead of being a program where you keep track of your collection and that's what it does, and you share your collection with other people, now it's a program where you make groups and you recommend things to each other and you have a forum and you discuss things, and then your profile just happens to include your entire collection of stuff and your ratings of it and everything.

649
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:50,500
Rym: Huh.

650
00:38:51,241 --> 00:38:54,900
Scott: You know, it's just like you have this giant profile that happens to be full of your entire collection.

651
00:38:56,142 --> 00:38:59,280
Scott: The last thing they actually added recently was mail.

652
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,080
Scott: You can just send messages to people in the system willy-nilly.

653
00:39:03,221 --> 00:39:03,819
Rym: Eh, that's alright.

654
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:04,640
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

655
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,900
Rym: I have so many systems like that already.

656
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:16,200
Rym: I mean, every now and then I log, 'cause I don't actually log into my Delicious often, I just post to it, and I looked in there the other day, and a whole bunch of people have sent me links that I never even noticed.

657
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:16,860
Scott: Mhm.

658
00:39:17,361 --> 00:39:22,460
Rym: Or, I'll log into, like, Orkut, and a million people have tried to say something to me, and I just haven't looked there.

659
00:39:23,151 --> 00:39:23,298
Scott: Yeah.

660
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:26,337
Scott: The thing is, Lestalle isn't really, you know, 100% perfect.

661
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:31,740
Scott: There's a lot of things they could add to it, like VHS, you know, I already talked about all of that.

662
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:37,972
Scott: And they could add some sort of automatic recommendation system, like, "Oh, you seem to match up with those people, huh?

663
00:39:38,032 --> 00:39:40,758
Scott: Maybe you should, you know, get on with

664
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:41,019
Scott: that.".

665
00:39:41,882 --> 00:39:43,640
Scott: But, you know.

666
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:48,000
Rym: See, that'd be tough for me, because while I like a lot of things, I don't purchase a lot of things.

667
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:52,580
Scott: It doesn't matter if you purchase a lot of things, 'cause you can go and rate and review things that you haven't purchased.

668
00:39:53,047 --> 00:39:53,800
Rym: Yeah, I guess not a lot.

669
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:57,680
Scott: You can go in and say what you want, whether you've purchased it or not, you know?

670
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:02,619
Scott: So, even if you don't have a lot of stuff, it can also look at, "Oh, he liked all this

671
00:40:02,659 --> 00:40:02,860
Scott: stuff.".

672
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:04,719
Scott: And you can go and review and talk.

673
00:40:05,887 --> 00:40:06,359
Scott: And share.

674
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,639
Scott: And keep track of borrowed goods.

675
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,540
Rym: Yeah, the keeping track of borrowed goods, especially books, is very much a point four.

676
00:40:14,046 --> 00:40:14,217
Scott: Yeah.

677
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:20,940
Scott: The only prob- the one problem I have with Lestalle, and I don't think there's any way to really fix this, is I have to do it.

678
00:40:21,281 --> 00:40:26,720
Scott: Like, whenever I buy books or video games or something, I come home, I have to remember to go to Lestalle and type it all in.

679
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:32,999
Rym: Now, it seems like this- like, the initial pain would just be, "Alright, I'm on Lestalle, I have to go through everything I own and type it

680
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:33,100
Rym: in.".

681
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:33,421
Scott: Yeah.

682
00:40:33,661 --> 00:40:41,340
Scott: Once everything you own is in, you know, you buy a few things at a time, and it's pretty pleasurable to add, like, you know, you go to the bookstore, you buy three books, you add 'em in.

683
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,208
Scott: One, two, three.

684
00:40:42,391 --> 00:40:42,819
Scott: That's fun.

685
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:47,000
Scott: Adding in the hundred books you already own that aren't in there, that's the painful part at the beginning.

686
00:40:47,881 --> 00:40:54,235
Scott: You know, but as long as you have, like, a numpad, and you type those ISBNs pretty quick, you know, you- ISBN, enter.

687
00:40:54,476 --> 00:40:55,158
Scott: ISBN, enter.

688
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:56,200
Scott: ISBN, enter.

689
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,672
Scott: Then- then, you know, eventually it's over and you go,

690
00:40:59,476 --> 00:40:59,556
Scott: "Ahh."

691
00:41:00,628 --> 00:41:01,120
Scott: And you're all good.

692
00:41:02,901 --> 00:41:05,849
Scott: You can also make- I think there are some other features I don't use so often.

693
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:09,400
Scott: Like, you can make, uh, special lists of stuff.

694
00:41:10,081 --> 00:41:19,240
Scott: Like, I could make a list, like, you know, um, "Awesome Metroid Games" or something, and I just make a custom list and I give it a name.

695
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,039
Scott: You just make lists of things.

696
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:21,677
Scott: Uh-huh.

697
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,976
Scott: You know, "Things I got this

698
00:41:24,056 --> 00:41:24,258
Scott: week.".

699
00:41:24,681 --> 00:41:26,013
Scott: "Things I'm going to buy next

700
00:41:26,073 --> 00:41:26,275
Scott: week.".

701
00:41:27,102 --> 00:41:28,451
Scott: "Things I want you to buy me for my

702
00:41:28,492 --> 00:41:28,915
Scott: birthday.".

703
00:41:30,044 --> 00:41:31,074
Scott: Uh, "Things Rym doesn't

704
00:41:31,135 --> 00:41:31,398
Scott: like."

705
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:33,680
Scott: Things Rym doesn't care about.

706
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,600
Scott: I just make a list of, you know, games, books, movies, and music that Rym doesn't like.

707
00:41:39,221 --> 00:41:47,460
Scott: You just make a list, and then people can look at the lists and share them with each other, and, you know, you can rate the things in the lists, and... You can pretty much do anything.

708
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,619
Scott: Except, uh, VHS tapes.

709
00:41:50,701 --> 00:41:51,864
Rym: Well, is that all your pitch?

710
00:41:51,964 --> 00:41:56,980
Rym: 'Cause then, like, uh, the Phoenix Wright judge, I will consider all the evidence and pass my judgment.

711
00:41:57,565 --> 00:41:58,096
Rym: Mm-mm-mm-mm.

712
00:41:58,468 --> 00:41:58,680
Rym: Alright.

713
00:41:58,940 --> 00:41:59,028
Rym: Yeah.

714
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:04,280
Rym: I'd slam the table, but I got the amplification really up, so that would just make a loud annoying noise into the microphone.

715
00:42:04,861 --> 00:42:13,920
Scott: Yeah, but this is for all you other people out there, if you have a lot of stuff, or you want to keep track of your stuff, and... Especially, come and join me, I think I'm one of the most active Listala users, I mean...

716
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,416
Rym: You might be.

717
00:42:14,962 --> 00:42:17,048
Rym: I have, like... You gave a good sales pitch for it.

718
00:42:17,189 --> 00:42:19,200
Rym: I mean, it's free, but you sold it to me.

719
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:24,393
Scott: I got 55 video games in there, one music, 205 books, and 42 DVDs.

720
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:28,659
Rym: Not too shabby.

721
00:42:29,304 --> 00:42:30,219
Scott: And, of course, one book.

722
00:42:30,501 --> 00:42:34,039
Scott: I actually have more books that are at my house, my parents' house, that aren't in there.

723
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:34,260
Scott: Oh!

724
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:40,440
Rym: Oh, God, I just remembered the hundreds of books that are in boxes in Arizona that I gotta get out here somehow.

725
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,600
Scott: Yeah, see, there you go, even though you're not buying any, you can just add all those in there.

726
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:48,500
Rym: Yeah, I'm really looking forward to having those shipped out here, and how much money that's gonna cost.

727
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,108
Scott: There's one more thing it actually does.

728
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:54,531
Scott: If you click on the main page for, like... I'm gonna click on the main page for books, right?

729
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:55,960
Scott: The book home page, right?

730
00:42:56,146 --> 00:42:56,400
Scott: Alright.

731
00:42:56,801 --> 00:42:59,690
Scott: It says on the left are the custom lists.

732
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:02,780
Scott: Of course, I don't have any custom lists, I never made any, so there's nothing there.

733
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,584
Scott: Then it says "My Tags".

734
00:43:05,046 --> 00:43:09,240
Scott: So, the tags is when you make your own categories for books, right?

735
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:17,540
Scott: So, the categories that I've made are there in alphabetical order, and next to each one is a parenthesis with the number of things in that category.

736
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:18,360
Scott: Alright.

737
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:29,260
Scott: Under that, it says "My Authors", and based on the number of things I own from each author, their name is bolder and closer to the beginning of the box.

738
00:43:29,961 --> 00:43:35,260
Rym: Weren't you the one who just recently, you were reading a bunch of comics that you thought were all great, and then you noticed that they're all by the same guy?

739
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,480
Scott: Yeah, you mean the guy who's the fourth on my list here, Brian K. Vaughan?

740
00:43:40,061 --> 00:43:52,520
Scott: You know, it's like, so what can happen with this is, let's say you're the kind of, like, before I started listening to these Comic Guys podcasts, I didn't pay attention to who wrote or drew comic books or anything, I didn't care.

741
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:57,840
Scott: You know, and maybe you read manga or you read books or you buy DVDs, you know?

742
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:00,040
Rym: Yeah, I never really paid attention to any of that myself.

743
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:06,600
Scott: Yeah, and you don't pay attention to who directs them or who acts in them or anything like that, right?

744
00:44:06,961 --> 00:44:09,527
Scott: Well, if you just add in your collection, look at here.

745
00:44:09,827 --> 00:44:10,790
Scott: DVD directors.

746
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:14,097
Scott: Mitsuo Fukuda is my number one director.

747
00:44:14,398 --> 00:44:15,280
Scott: Let's see what he directs.

748
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,429
Scott: Oh, he directed the ten Gundam Seed DVDs that I got.

749
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,653
Scott: Alright, let's see.

750
00:44:19,713 --> 00:44:25,228
Scott: Noboro Mitsuo, oh, he directed Initial D. Alright, because those are the DVDs I have the most of.

751
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:29,800
Scott: Oh, apparently someone different directed the first season of Initial D as opposed to the second.

752
00:44:30,361 --> 00:44:31,619
Rym: You know, that explains a bit.

753
00:44:31,981 --> 00:44:32,181
Scott: Yeah.

754
00:44:33,163 --> 00:44:34,225
Scott: John Walker the 18th.

755
00:44:34,305 --> 00:44:35,668
Scott: Oh, he directed Transformers.

756
00:44:36,129 --> 00:44:38,032
Scott: Alright, so you get the idea here.

757
00:44:38,112 --> 00:44:42,140
Scott: You know, you add in your collection and then, boop, oh, those are the directors I like.

758
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:47,940
Scott: And then you can go search for those directors, see what else they directed, add that stuff to your wanted list, et cetera, et cetera.

759
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:51,752
Scott: You know, like, I don't know actors and actresses either, but, oh, here they are.

760
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,417
Scott: Oh, Donnie Yen.

761
00:44:53,938 --> 00:44:54,300
Scott: I know him.

762
00:44:55,281 --> 00:44:55,473
Scott: Uh-huh.

763
00:44:55,947 --> 00:44:56,480
Scott: You know, he's in there.

764
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:02,500
Rym: Maybe if you, uh, do this more and more, you'll be able to pass that Anime World Order test that I failed so miserably at Katsu-kan.

765
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:03,201
Scott: Yeah, probably.

766
00:45:03,241 --> 00:45:04,344
Scott: It's the same with music, too.

767
00:45:04,405 --> 00:45:09,700
Scott: Like, you add your albums and it tells you what artists, you know, you can see which artist, visibly, you got more of.

768
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,418
Scott: And video games, it does it for systems, which isn't so useful.

769
00:45:13,478 --> 00:45:15,980
Rym: Not even- Huh, we have mostly GameCube and DS games.

770
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:20,729
Scott: Actually, Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Color, GameCube and DS are equally bold.

771
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:26,200
Scott: Then PC is slightly less bold, PlayStation is slightly less bold, and the original Game Boy is tiny.

772
00:45:26,741 --> 00:45:27,082
Rym: All right.

773
00:45:27,502 --> 00:45:30,868
Rym: So, all that considered, I will pass my judgment.

774
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:37,760
Rym: There are many points for, and I am one tiny step away from jumping into this with both feet.

775
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,143
Rym: It's awesome.

776
00:45:39,163 --> 00:45:39,926
Rym: I think it's really cool.

777
00:45:40,288 --> 00:45:42,800
Rym: The only thing is that it doesn't have board games.

778
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,360
Scott: Yeah, I know, right?

779
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:51,520
Rym: Like, if it had board games, if when I asked about board games, you would have said, "Yeah, it has board games," I would have been making an account right now while I'm talking.

780
00:45:51,942 --> 00:45:52,007
Scott: Yep.

781
00:45:52,881 --> 00:45:57,620
Rym: But I'm real close, and if there's ever a hint that board games are coming, I think I'm going to be a list dollar.

782
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:05,437
Scott: Yeah, we just, you know, I keep going into their forum and pushing, like, "Hey, you guys need to add other stuff besides these four things,".

783
00:46:05,517 --> 00:46:06,379
Scott: and I don't know.

784
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:11,020
Scott: They seem like they just want to keep it simple, which is understandable from a design perspective.

785
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,832
Rym: Well, I also wonder, what's their privacy agreement?

786
00:46:13,852 --> 00:46:15,800
Rym: Do they sell the data to marketers or anything?

787
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,520
Scott: Oh, no, there's just some guy making a thing.

788
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:18,840
Rym: But does he have a policy?

789
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,880
Rym: Hmm, let me- Does he have a written privacy policy?

790
00:46:22,361 --> 00:46:23,002
Rym: I'm just curious.

791
00:46:23,302 --> 00:46:35,860
Rym: I mean, I don't care if some secret government agency or some horrible marketing company knows that I like Harris Greenwood, and I tend to watch a lot of shoujo crap anime, but I'd like to know that they know.

792
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:40,799
Scott: Um, it doesn't actually say anywhere, but it does say this.

793
00:46:42,421 --> 00:46:44,726
Scott: Um, "Lestalle was created by Tom Maschord.

794
00:46:45,187 --> 00:46:49,417
Scott: He's been involved in a number of web projects, most notably Dark Galaxy, an online

795
00:46:49,437 --> 00:46:49,718
Scott: game.".

796
00:46:49,878 --> 00:46:50,540
Scott: Alright, whatever.

797
00:46:51,322 --> 00:46:59,738
Scott: "Over the last few years, he was fascinated with the development of so many different social websites like Flickr, Friendster, and Delicious, he decided to just create one centered around media

798
00:46:59,758 --> 00:47:00,259
Scott: collections.".

799
00:47:01,421 --> 00:47:02,787
Scott: That's it, it's just some guy made it.

800
00:47:03,189 --> 00:47:10,780
Rym: It's not anything corporate, or there's no one- No, no, it's not anything corporate, but there's nothing prohibiting him from just selling all the data to people willy-nilly.

801
00:47:12,006 --> 00:47:14,400
Scott: Let me see if there's a EULA when you click the sign up button.

802
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,784
Scott: Okay, wow, wow, wow, wow.

803
00:47:19,368 --> 00:47:24,140
Scott: No, there really is nothing, no agreement whatsoever when you join Lestalle at all.

804
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:31,380
Scott: I just typed in, like, FUBAR and some crummy password, and in two seconds I had an account and I was logged in, and he didn't even have to do a confirmation email.

805
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:32,483
Scott: Great.

806
00:47:32,503 --> 00:47:32,886
Scott: Or anything.

807
00:47:33,814 --> 00:47:34,460
Scott: It's that easy.

808
00:47:35,461 --> 00:47:36,384
Rym: Um, alright.

809
00:47:36,665 --> 00:47:42,631
Rym: The only thing I wonder about is what he does with the data, or if he's ever gonna- I don't think he does anything with the data, I think it just-.

810
00:47:46,481 --> 00:47:50,259
Scott: Well, also, we didn't, you know, explicitly give him permission to do it, either.

811
00:47:54,921 --> 00:47:55,563
Rym: Hmm, that's fine.

812
00:47:55,603 --> 00:47:56,245
Rym: What do I care?

813
00:47:56,326 --> 00:48:07,220
Rym: if someone knows- Oh yeah, I'm not saying I care, it's not even a strike against, but if I were him, and he's really just a cool hobbyist, he should put something up.

814
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:11,420
Rym: He should put some sort of "I'm not gonna use your data for this" or something.

815
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,546
Scott: I think he's just never come up.

816
00:48:13,827 --> 00:48:16,800
Scott: Maybe I'll go say something in the forum, I'm sure he'll take care of that right away.

817
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,560
Rym: Let's find out, maybe we'll interview him on the show.

818
00:48:18,942 --> 00:48:19,049
Scott: Maybe.

819
00:48:19,681 --> 00:48:20,096
Rym: I'd like to.

820
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:20,606
Scott: Yeah.

821
00:48:21,461 --> 00:48:26,300
Rym: Alright, we thought we were gonna also talk about Delicious today, but we've already done a whole show on Lestalle.

822
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:27,519
Scott: Did we really do a whole show?

823
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:28,539
Rym: Yeah, we pretty much did.

824
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:28,785
Rym: Wow.

825
00:48:29,121 --> 00:48:33,000
Rym: We've been going long for the last week, so this episode's actually back to the normal length for now.

826
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:37,820
Scott: Going long is good because then, um, we don't have to come up with more crap.

827
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:47,169
Rym: And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

828
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:49,760
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

829
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:54,559
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontrowcrew.com.

830
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,579
Scott: If you like our podcasts, you'll love our forums, make sure you visit them.

831
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:02,540
Scott: You can send your email feedback to geeknights@gmail.com.

832
00:49:03,101 --> 00:49:05,208
Scott: And if you want, you can leave us a voicemail at 206-333-1537.

833
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,660
Rym: GeekNights airs every weeknight, Monday through Thursday.

834
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,600
Scott: GeekNights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

835
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:20,480
Scott: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
