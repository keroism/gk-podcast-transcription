1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,451
Scott: It's Monday October 16th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,093 --> 00:00:24,700
Scott: Tonight, we have a really boring conversation Well, if you can call it a conversation where we read about image file formats from Wikipedia Because we didn't do research and we were lazy.

3
00:00:25,563 --> 00:00:33,459
Scott: So if you really care about image file formats listen beyond the things of the day, but if not Yeah, get ready for some boring times.

4
00:00:34,922 --> 00:00:35,958
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:37,381 --> 00:00:46,385
Rym: Well, it's Monday so obviously what I'm about to say is the thing I've said every Monday for the past couple months We're back from somewhere And you know what?

6
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,653
Scott: I was a little tired earlier.

7
00:00:47,693 --> 00:00:48,619
Scott: I'm not so tired right now.

8
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:54,859
Rym: Yeah, I got a little bit of an adrenaline rush from eating food and moving around, but I think I'm gonna crash in a little bit.

9
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,286
Scott: Yeah, as soon as it shows over.

10
00:00:57,427 --> 00:00:59,093
Scott: I'm hitting some hay.

11
00:00:59,234 --> 00:01:00,980
Rym: I almost fell asleep with a big mallet.

12
00:01:01,281 --> 00:01:06,080
Rym: I almost fell asleep driving to work and I almost fell asleep driving home from work and I took an hour nap at work.

13
00:01:06,482 --> 00:01:14,920
Scott: I remember driving to and home from work and on Monday, you know I kind of like Monday at work because time just freakin flies like whoosh.

14
00:01:16,182 --> 00:01:24,379
Rym: Though of course we spent the weekend at the northern geek house Which is very similar to our geek house only it's in Albany and it's got a lot more crap in it.

15
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,847
Scott: Yeah, and it's you know newer.

16
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:31,060
Rym: Well, there's some stories from it that are all going to be saved for various geek fables.

17
00:01:32,021 --> 00:01:39,740
Rym: Good good, and of course, I think tomorrow we're going to have to tell the tale of perhaps my favorite video game character ever Scrote's.

18
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,987
Rym: Scrote's growth is a hero.

19
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:42,931
Scott: Yeah, what the hell.

20
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:44,417
Scott: who cares about freaking Mario?

21
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,240
Scott: It's all about screw.

22
00:01:45,482 --> 00:01:46,630
Rym: I gotta say scrote's.

23
00:01:46,932 --> 00:01:48,080
Scott: he needs to be in Smash Brothers.

24
00:01:48,281 --> 00:01:51,070
Rym: I think scrote's is gonna be the the mascot of GeekNights.

25
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:52,113
Scott: That's not good.

26
00:01:52,334 --> 00:01:52,695
Rym: Why not?

27
00:01:52,796 --> 00:01:54,020
Rym: I would wear a scrote's t-shirt.

28
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:55,849
Scott: Okay, you can wear the scrote's t-shirt.

29
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:58,000
Rym: who would not wear a scrote's t-shirt?

30
00:01:59,402 --> 00:02:02,760
Scott: Someone who wouldn't wear a goat's e t-shirt, it's nothing like goat's e.

31
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,151
Rym: It's just a cute little fighting thing from a ps2 game.

32
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:08,138
Scott: Yeah called screw.

33
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:20,350
Rym: Yeah Yeah names can be unfortunately ironic But it's not ironic because it is what you expect not the opposite a cute funny Monster that fights by swinging its little tail.

34
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:22,860
Scott: I thought you wanted to save the story of scrote's to for tomorrow.

35
00:02:22,961 --> 00:02:24,589
Rym: I'm not gonna actually tell the story of scrote's.

36
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,499
Rym: All right, I just you know led up to it.

37
00:02:27,202 --> 00:02:28,526
Rym: Uh-huh create a bit of buzz.

38
00:02:28,967 --> 00:02:30,452
Scott: I'm sure all right fine.

39
00:02:30,472 --> 00:02:31,234
Rym: Then what are you on the news?

40
00:02:32,097 --> 00:02:32,619
Scott: Oh the news.

41
00:02:32,679 --> 00:02:36,079
Scott: well McDonald's in Japan.

42
00:02:37,662 --> 00:02:50,012
Scott: they gave away mp3 players as Prizes in a coca-cola promotion or something and it was like this little tiny USB Stick that you could also put headphones in and play mp3s.

43
00:02:50,373 --> 00:02:52,100
Scott: Mm-hmm, which is not you know, so bad.

44
00:02:53,227 --> 00:03:07,256
Scott: but Apparently when you put this thing in your computer It has ten songs on it, which is cool but it also has horrible horrible Trojan on it called QQ pass.

45
00:03:07,538 --> 00:03:07,920
Rym: Wait a minute.

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,359
Rym: So McDonald's gave away an mp3 player that already had a virus on it.

47
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,030
Scott: Yeah, so you plug it in.

48
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:29,520
Scott: if you take this USB stick That's also an mp3 player that has ten songs on it already and plug it into any Windows computer It gives that Windows computer the QQ pass Trojan, which is intended to steal login data.

49
00:03:30,783 --> 00:03:31,166
Rym: You know what?

50
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:33,460
Rym: It's a great type of DRM there.

51
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:42,432
Rym: I mean if you try to get those songs off of this mp3 player, oh you get a virus it punishes you know I guess it is it's.

52
00:03:42,512 --> 00:03:42,613
Scott: it's.

53
00:03:44,661 --> 00:03:50,649
Scott: Wow, if you want to call it DRM because it doesn't actually stop you from sharing the music You know what.

54
00:03:50,790 --> 00:04:08,900
Scott: neither does DRM oh No, but the point is is that you know in Windows it's really hard to be secure from USB stick vert What I call it vector the USB vector of virus and Trojan infection.

55
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:16,119
Rym: Well considering that Windows will pretty much if it sees a USB device Probe it open it and execute anything it sees.

56
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:32,100
Scott: Yeah, I know Linux does the same thing but only for users in certain groups and only in certain, you know, you can actually easily Secure a Linux system against USB devices, you know It's trivial to make a Linux system that won't even have support any USB whatsoever.

57
00:04:32,221 --> 00:04:34,495
Scott: You just recompile the kernel without USB.

58
00:04:34,777 --> 00:04:35,159
Scott: There you go.

59
00:04:35,641 --> 00:04:37,206
Rym: Well furthermore, I mean you really can't.

60
00:04:37,386 --> 00:04:46,838
Scott: Trojans don't work in Linux unless you're running as root, which you're not Yeah, but I mean even in Windows if you weren't running as root this Trojan would still get you.

61
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:48,203
Rym: oh, yeah That's the way Windows is.

62
00:04:48,343 --> 00:04:53,060
Rym: Yeah, because there's really no you have to run as root in Windows or things don't work.

63
00:04:54,201 --> 00:04:59,300
Rym: Even in the newest version of Windows XP run as another you know, I wonder if they'll fix that shit in Vista.

64
00:04:59,682 --> 00:05:00,526
Rym: I highly doubt it.

65
00:05:00,748 --> 00:05:09,536
Scott: Yeah, it just reminds me at that time that the The the company was a security consultant and they were testing the company to see how secure their systems were.

66
00:05:09,696 --> 00:05:10,258
Rym: what company?

67
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,562
Scott: I forget It was a story.

68
00:05:11,623 --> 00:05:16,180
Scott: I was at news a long time ago when and they left USB sticks like lying outside the company.

69
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:17,639
Rym: Oh, yeah, I think we talked about on the show.

70
00:05:18,563 --> 00:05:20,751
Scott: Like I just said half the employees picked him up.

71
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:21,393
Rym: Yes.

72
00:05:21,433 --> 00:05:23,300
Scott: They just picked him up and stuck him in their computers.

73
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,015
Rym: Yeah, people just security has nothing to do with the pcs at this point.

74
00:05:28,035 --> 00:05:29,179
Rym: It just has to do with the users.

75
00:05:29,822 --> 00:05:33,679
Scott: Yeah, but here's a case where you know, it's not even someone trying to hack.

76
00:05:34,482 --> 00:05:36,360
Scott: Maybe someone did try to put these on there.

77
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,747
Rym: No, you can't get a Trojan by accident.

78
00:05:38,867 --> 00:05:49,100
Rym: either someone at the place where they were making them was evil or got paid off or Someone was really stupid and left the system that was flashing all these things insecure.

79
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,799
Scott: That I think that might make sense.

80
00:05:52,181 --> 00:05:54,851
Scott: You know someone who was make said it putting all the music on here.

81
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:56,980
Rym: probably had he had a compromised box.

82
00:05:57,201 --> 00:06:01,160
Rym: Yeah, of course, even then it had to be set as auto executable on the USB.

83
00:06:01,481 --> 00:06:05,120
Rym: So it really I'm pretty sure it was intentional by someone in the chain.

84
00:06:05,882 --> 00:06:12,100
Scott: It could have been but you know, it won't be hard to find out who it was, you know McDonald's subcontracted that out.

85
00:06:12,481 --> 00:06:13,386
Scott: Oh, definitely.

86
00:06:13,546 --> 00:06:14,451
Scott: Well, it's coca-cola.

87
00:06:14,471 --> 00:06:15,978
Scott: Maybe also it was a team-up.

88
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:21,456
Rym: Yeah Yeah, they contracted out to somewhere in India probably maybe China and the just people didn't care.

89
00:06:21,536 --> 00:06:22,559
Rym: They weren't being paid much.

90
00:06:23,643 --> 00:06:29,319
Rym: I mean I can tell you right now the amount of care I put into work I do is directly proportional to how much money I'm paid to do it.

91
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:38,005
Scott: Well anyone who wants to get a lot of credit card data, here's what you do Give out free mp3 players that are also USB sticks and Don't even give them out.

92
00:06:38,025 --> 00:06:39,795
Rym: Just leave them laying around in a Starbucks.

93
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:40,800
Scott: even better.

94
00:06:41,021 --> 00:06:42,284
Rym: Not even just flash drives.

95
00:06:42,325 --> 00:06:52,679
Rym: just buy 32 megabyte flash drives and just leave them lying around with a funny Embarrassing sounding love letter on them and some random mp3s and a bunch of Trojans.

96
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,225
Rym: It's foolproof.

97
00:06:54,325 --> 00:07:01,060
Rym: No, no one with a Windows computer can protect against that except, you know Not putting a USB device in your computer.

98
00:07:02,261 --> 00:07:08,600
Scott: Yeah, there isn't even a crazy news story going around on the normal news saying don't put random USB drives in your computer.

99
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:14,240
Scott: I think this hell, you know, we could probably leave like floppy disks and CDs lying around and people will do it.

100
00:07:14,563 --> 00:07:16,441
Rym: Oh, yeah, that was a big thing back in the day I used.

101
00:07:16,481 --> 00:07:22,240
Rym: in fact, I used to leave floppy disks around my middle school that had various Trojans and viruses on them.

102
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:34,148
Rym: Awesome in addition to games Yeah, in fact, I made a version of LHX a special disk where you put it in and you start it up Right, and it'll act like it's installing LHX.

103
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:53,759
Rym: But while that little status bar I made in the batch script is going along It's also searching your computer for dot doc files dot text files in certain directories based on where people would very likely have them Compressing them copying them to the disk over writing the game files to make up more space as it puts the game files on the PC

104
00:07:54,781 --> 00:07:54,983
Scott: Yeah,

105
00:07:55,284 --> 00:07:57,557
Rym: then making them hidden and then they give the disk back to me.

106
00:07:58,322 --> 00:08:01,920
Rym: Yeah, I used it on a few people and I got nothing interesting.

107
00:08:04,682 --> 00:08:11,805
Rym: All right, all right, so in the news a while ago this French study and I wanted to talk about it for a while I just never really got the chance today.

108
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:12,608
Rym: I can finally bring it up.

109
00:08:13,511 --> 00:08:22,903
Rym: the study basically tried to correlate cognitive ability intelligence a form of intelligence with Obesity.

110
00:08:23,365 --> 00:08:25,232
Scott: Well, it's really easy to measure obesity.

111
00:08:25,252 --> 00:08:26,216
Scott: I mean you look at someone.

112
00:08:26,557 --> 00:08:31,920
Rym: well, not really No, what they used is the BMI which is not the best metric in the world.

113
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,606
Rym: But here's the thing that bothers me.

114
00:08:34,087 --> 00:08:38,785
Rym: every time BMI comes up on like Fark it's like Farks the worst place.

115
00:08:38,806 --> 00:08:39,932
Rym: but slash dot and dig to.

116
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:53,880
Rym: a Whole bunch of really really fat people will come in and say BMI is crap It breaks down if you're actually really really strong or you're actually super super super in shape or you're really really really really really.

117
00:08:54,161 --> 00:08:55,749
Scott: These are really really really fat people.

118
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,035
Scott: So what do you care if it's wrong?

119
00:08:57,096 --> 00:08:57,719
Scott: It's right for you?

120
00:08:58,281 --> 00:09:02,373
Rym: Well, the thing is a lot of people say oh BMI is worthless.

121
00:09:02,413 --> 00:09:14,659
Rym: Therefore, even though it says I'm obese I know that I'm healthy when the truth is most people if you are above the line for obesity Under BMI, you're probably obese.

122
00:09:15,662 --> 00:09:22,779
Scott: Yeah, it's like uh that measurement there, you know that that measurement doesn't work on some other group of people that aren't me.

123
00:09:22,859 --> 00:09:25,426
Scott: therefore I don't get measured by it.

124
00:09:25,627 --> 00:09:29,302
Rym: Well, the thing is bodybuilders always say yeah BMI is crap, too But that's just.

125
00:09:29,363 --> 00:09:30,487
Rym: I don't know why they even care.

126
00:09:30,507 --> 00:09:33,560
Scott: Yeah, why if you're a bodybuilder, what do you care?

127
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,705
Scott: If you know a measurement for fat people isn't correct about the other fat You're a mad muscle man.

128
00:09:38,825 --> 00:09:43,300
Rym: The other point is that BMI is not really useful for an individual.

129
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:56,664
Rym: It's more of a statistical thing to track obesity and track trends because while it'll pull in, you know Really really fit people they're the minority and it's a very good metric for determining how obese a population is or Correlating things.

130
00:09:56,925 --> 00:10:00,618
Scott: but alright, let's say that really really in shape people weren't the minority.

131
00:10:00,638 --> 00:10:01,180
Scott: then what we do?

132
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:02,648
Rym: We'd use other metrics.

133
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:03,413
Rym: There are other metrics.

134
00:10:03,453 --> 00:10:04,941
Rym: BMI is just the simplest Uh-huh.

135
00:10:05,162 --> 00:10:10,658
Rym: All it really is is a ratio between height and weight and age is an agent.

136
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:12,706
Rym: Oh, no No, it's really simple.

137
00:10:12,867 --> 00:10:14,132
Scott: All right, there was another one with age.

138
00:10:14,172 --> 00:10:15,980
Rym: I thought there are hundreds of them Scott.

139
00:10:16,161 --> 00:10:19,275
Rym: Anyway, now the study here just had a court.

140
00:10:19,315 --> 00:10:20,400
Rym: They did a bunch of study.

141
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:25,623
Rym: I think they studied two thousand three thousand people and they gave him tests and then they followed up I think five years later.

142
00:10:25,924 --> 00:10:39,420
Rym: I don't have the article in front of me, but I read it last week and they found a Fairly significant though not directly applicable correlation between lack of intelligence and obesity.

143
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:45,111
Scott: Now I could have told you that that alone wouldn't have really been news.

144
00:10:45,171 --> 00:11:01,731
Rym: cuz alright one study where it found a slight correlation but apparently there have been a whole bunch of studies and all of them point to the fact that either people who are obese are made less intelligent by it or People who are less intelligent are more likely to become obese.

145
00:11:02,373 --> 00:11:04,180
Rym: or there might be a third confounding factor.

146
00:11:04,701 --> 00:11:11,200
Scott: Yeah, it's tough to say, you know, but you look around and I it seems like you think about it you go.

147
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:21,178
Scott: Yeah, all the stupid people seem to be fat, you know, it's like you see a stupid guy usually also a fat guy But at the same time a lot of some smart people seem to be fat, too.

148
00:11:21,761 --> 00:11:23,910
Scott: So, I don't know if it's the.

149
00:11:24,252 --> 00:11:26,160
Scott: if the fat actually causes the stupid.

150
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,813
Scott: I think it might be more.

151
00:11:27,873 --> 00:11:28,740
Scott: the stupid is the fat.

152
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,940
Rym: I'm pretty sure stupid causes fat because the things that cause fat are pretty much as ignorant stupid or lazy.

153
00:11:34,603 --> 00:11:36,190
Rym: Yeah, those three will cause fat.

154
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,500
Rym: or or you know, the very rare medical condition.

155
00:11:39,463 --> 00:11:44,180
Scott: It seems like fat can invades all groups, you know from the dumbest to the smartest.

156
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,220
Scott: It's just that the dumber you are the more likely you are to be fat.

157
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:56,547
Scott: Like I'd say just shoot numbers like of stupid people like 80% are also fat and of smart people Maybe like 40%.

158
00:11:56,547 --> 00:12:05,940
Rym: course relatedly there's been a lot of talk lately about how this whole obesity thing is overrated and we shouldn't worry about it because a lot of People are just a little overweight and that won't hurt him.

159
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,440
Rym: But there was a study that I just listened to on BBC News Where they basically found a correlation that now this is a very specific study.

160
00:12:14,182 --> 00:12:21,007
Rym: It was women who got pregnant and then at some point in the future got pregnant again And they followed this them for a while.

161
00:12:21,669 --> 00:12:34,660
Rym: and if you now they're not counting weight gain by pregnancy itself But a weight gain of as little as seven pounds between two pregnancies Greatly greatly greatly greatly enhances your chances of getting diabetes and all sorts of other diseases.

162
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,756
Scott: Wow, yes seven only in between pregnancies though.

163
00:12:38,816 --> 00:12:39,840
Rym: Well, that was just the study.

164
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:48,198
Rym: They were testing a bunch of other things and then they found this very clear correlation between small weight gain and massive chances of disease later on.

165
00:12:49,046 --> 00:12:50,820
Scott: Wow, but only between pregnancies.

166
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:57,520
Scott: So like it did not has anything to do with men or women with just one pregnancy or it's kind of it was one study.

167
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:57,881
Rym: It just.

168
00:12:57,962 --> 00:12:59,045
Rym: they found this correlation.

169
00:12:59,086 --> 00:12:59,728
Rym: That's all I said.

170
00:12:59,748 --> 00:13:00,230
Rym: Yeah.

171
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,080
Scott: I'm just wondering like about the in-between pregnancy part of it.

172
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,024
Scott: It's kind of weird.

173
00:13:04,245 --> 00:13:04,948
Rym: Well, they were.

174
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,837
Rym: they were testing a lot of things about.

175
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:15,973
Rym: you know Lifestyle changes between pregnancies or does pregnancy have an effect on the body things like that Tricky stuff, you know science.

176
00:13:16,154 --> 00:13:16,696
Rym: Yeah.

177
00:13:17,038 --> 00:13:18,925
Scott: Yeah No, but it's it's.

178
00:13:19,307 --> 00:13:23,946
Scott: the thing is if people want to say oh, it's okay to be fat blah blah blah blah blah I'm like, all right fine.

179
00:13:24,026 --> 00:13:25,960
Scott: You can all be fat, but you don't get health care.

180
00:13:26,363 --> 00:13:28,099
Rym: Well, no, they should be able to pay for their own health care.

181
00:13:28,473 --> 00:13:31,756
Scott: Yeah and they should charge them out the ass and they should be allowed to charge them out the ass.

182
00:13:31,836 --> 00:13:32,258
Scott: and it's not.

183
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:36,338
Scott: it shouldn't be Against the law to discriminate against fat people in situations.

184
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:36,699
Scott: It's not.

185
00:13:37,664 --> 00:13:38,388
Scott: Well, it is some.

186
00:13:38,408 --> 00:13:39,031
Scott: no it isn't.

187
00:13:39,132 --> 00:13:41,482
Scott: they always complain and make a deal It is not.

188
00:13:41,562 --> 00:13:48,423
Rym: it is only illegal to discriminate for for certain things like housing employment There's a few things.

189
00:13:48,483 --> 00:13:50,570
Rym: it varies a little bit state-by-state in the United States.

190
00:13:51,051 --> 00:13:54,080
Rym: You cannot discriminate based on age race gender.

191
00:13:55,802 --> 00:14:02,513
Rym: Hmm pretty much anything else is open game Including sexual orientation because of the way the laws are stupidly written.

192
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:03,055
Rym: Yeah.

193
00:14:03,557 --> 00:14:04,359
Rym: Yeah, that's not cool.

194
00:14:05,582 --> 00:14:09,480
Scott: But I mean there needs to be a lot more obesity discrimination, I think there isn't enough.

195
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:10,239
Rym: You know what?

196
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,347
Rym: There is a lot of Cedar Point there.

197
00:14:12,387 --> 00:14:15,097
Rym: there is because the thing is the hunter.

198
00:14:15,137 --> 00:14:15,940
Rym: how much they argue.

199
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,500
Rym: I remember I saw this first hand.

200
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:30,225
Rym: We were in line for the Raptor at Cedar Point and this really really really fat woman gets up there with her kid And she they won't let her on and she's screaming like you can't discriminate against me This is discriminatory.

201
00:14:30,265 --> 00:14:41,538
Rym: and she she wasn't using the word discriminatory because I don't think that word was in her vocabulary But she was saying but slightly yet another example of stupid fact slightly less syllabic words.

202
00:14:41,778 --> 00:14:52,147
Rym: and finally Yeah Anyway, the Cedar Point employer walks over and he says all right You can ride and she's you know, huff-puff.

203
00:14:52,729 --> 00:14:56,920
Rym: and she's tries to squeeze herself into the little seat and pull the thing down and she can't.

204
00:14:58,502 --> 00:14:59,528
Rym: And no one said anything.

205
00:14:59,548 --> 00:15:04,630
Rym: the Cedar Point guy just stood there and watched her and She's trying and pulling it down and it won't go.

206
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:08,946
Rym: and she asked for help and he pulls it up And then he says wow, you just don't fit.

207
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:10,872
Rym: I can't close the latch.

208
00:15:11,313 --> 00:15:13,620
Rym: if I run the rollercoaster, you'll fall out and die.

209
00:15:14,062 --> 00:15:15,712
Rym: I'm sorry, but you can't ride.

210
00:15:16,255 --> 00:15:24,780
Rym: and she just looked so Angry, but she didn't say a word because there was nothing she could say and she dragged her son out of the park.

211
00:15:25,161 --> 00:15:29,220
Rym: Yeah, I just feel bad for the kid cuz he wasn't fat and he didn't get to ride a rollercoaster.

212
00:15:30,242 --> 00:15:39,180
Scott: poor kid They really should just take the kid away from a parent like that Just to let him ride the rollercoaster, you know, there's a chance it was his grandma or an aunt or something.

213
00:15:39,582 --> 00:15:39,803
Scott: I'm not.

214
00:15:39,863 --> 00:15:40,887
Scott: I'm done saying that I'm just.

215
00:15:41,088 --> 00:15:43,740
Scott: you know, yeah, they should get the kid to roll the rollercoaster.

216
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,623
Scott: You shouldn't be allowed to.

217
00:15:44,824 --> 00:15:45,768
Scott: you know, that's child abuse.

218
00:15:45,808 --> 00:15:48,679
Scott: taking a kid out of amusement park like that without riding any rides.

219
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:00,540
Scott: things of the day Man I changed my thing today up at the last second.

220
00:16:00,842 --> 00:16:02,910
Rym: Yeah, because you found something mildly amusing.

221
00:16:03,372 --> 00:16:05,700
Scott: Well, the thing before was not amusing at all.

222
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,764
Rym: What was the thing before?

223
00:16:07,326 --> 00:16:11,057
Scott: it was it was a DS flash cart home.

224
00:16:11,197 --> 00:16:13,445
Rym: Oh, yeah, we could just do an episode on DS homebrew.

225
00:16:13,626 --> 00:16:15,654
Scott: as soon as I get one of these things I'm gonna cuz.

226
00:16:15,956 --> 00:16:17,303
Scott: it's a really crazy world.

227
00:16:17,323 --> 00:16:17,947
Scott: Let me tell you.

228
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:21,722
Rym: Yeah I want scrotch to be my thing of the day, but I don't have a picture of him.

229
00:16:21,943 --> 00:16:23,710
Scott: No, too bad too bad.

230
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:27,889
Scott: You and your obsession with scrotch may know how obsessed Rym is with scrotch.

231
00:16:28,411 --> 00:16:49,482
Rym: Um, I would just like to point out and I have a lot of people to back me up that when scrotch was finally unveiled after the final important bit was added to scrotch the first person in the room to react was Scott who said the words, ah, Yeah If anyone is a fan of scrotch, it's my friend Scott here.

232
00:16:49,502 --> 00:16:51,610
Scott: Well, let me tell you I did not obsess about screw.

233
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,254
Scott: It's long after his demise.

234
00:16:53,495 --> 00:16:57,286
Rym: like you I'm sure you're saving that for tonight.

235
00:16:57,687 --> 00:16:57,847
Scott: Yeah.

236
00:16:58,228 --> 00:17:04,424
Scott: Yeah anyway, so my new thing of the day is a crazy Japanese TV show.

237
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:09,569
Scott: OMG Ha who knows what's going on with this crazy Japanese TV shows?

238
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:19,474
Rym: Like they'll bring a girl out and they'll strap some meat to her head and sticker it stick it in a cage with a iguana Or something that was only the one famous Morning Musume show.

239
00:17:19,797 --> 00:17:23,589
Rym: Yeah, but I have a feeling somehow become the stereotype of Japanese television.

240
00:17:24,092 --> 00:17:29,890
Rym: The thing is I decided when I saw that the first time all I could think seeing I've seen crazier Japanese stuff than this.

241
00:17:30,211 --> 00:17:34,665
Scott: Yeah for me the stereotype of Japanese television is Takeshi's castle.

242
00:17:35,247 --> 00:17:39,008
Scott: No, it's Tokyo breakfast.

243
00:17:40,552 --> 00:17:41,295
Scott: Is that what it's called?

244
00:17:41,736 --> 00:17:49,730
Rym: Yeah Tokyo breakfast the thing we almost got kicked out of the anime club for yep That's search for Tokyo breakfast, but anyway, we'll make that a thing of the day.

245
00:17:49,939 --> 00:17:52,096
Scott: Yeah Today's thing of the day a classic thing of the day.

246
00:17:52,538 --> 00:18:00,969
Scott: today's thing of the day is a guy flying a helicopter a real Helicopter, you know the kind that they use to check on traffic and weather and all that crap.

247
00:18:01,771 --> 00:18:07,769
Scott: but this helicopter has a camera and a bottle opener attached to one of the.

248
00:18:08,453 --> 00:18:09,660
Scott: What are the little things called that?

249
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,209
Scott: it lands on the landing bit the ski?

250
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:15,650
Scott: So the front of one of the skis the technical term is landing bit.

251
00:18:16,371 --> 00:18:17,756
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what.

252
00:18:17,776 --> 00:18:19,361

265
00:18:45,346 --> 00:18:47,055
Rym: watch finally We'll talk about something.

266
00:18:47,075 --> 00:18:48,221
Rym: None of our listeners know about.

267
00:18:48,281 --> 00:18:50,030
Scott: he don't know about helicopters.

268
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:51,314
Rym: I know a little bit.

269
00:18:51,595 --> 00:18:52,017
Rym: I know the.

270
00:18:52,739 --> 00:18:57,297
Rym: I know the how to pilot one, but let me qualify that I know how to pilot.

271
00:18:57,377 --> 00:18:57,699
Rym: Wow.

272
00:18:57,759 --> 00:18:57,980
Rym: I did.

273
00:18:58,261 --> 00:19:00,170
Rym: I do not have the ability to pilot.

274
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,818
Scott: I just realized I know less about helicopters than I thought.

275
00:19:02,858 --> 00:19:06,590
Scott: maybe we should buy the $30 remote-control Pico Z remote control.

276
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,690
Rym: That's gonna end with one of us losing an eye.

277
00:19:09,032 --> 00:19:11,546
Scott: I think I'm gonna get it now just so I could learn about how I got.

278
00:19:11,566 --> 00:19:11,948
Rym: well buy him.

279
00:19:11,968 --> 00:19:13,136
Rym: tomorrow We're going to Radio Shack.

00:19:14,628 --> 00:19:17,187
Scott: So On the front right ski, right?

282
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:18,916
Rym: I gotta warn you all.

283
00:19:18,956 --> 00:19:21,450
Rym: now Scott and I are buying remote-controlled helicopters.

284
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:25,242
Rym: There might not be a show tomorrow because we might be dead anyway.

285
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:36,082
Scott: on the front of the right ski He's got a camera and a bottle opener and they've got these two platforms and on each platform are like six or seven bottles of beer.

286
00:19:36,644 --> 00:19:41,740
Scott: and he flies a real helicopter and Opens up all these bottles of beer.

287
00:19:42,163 --> 00:19:55,286
Scott: It's quite impressive like wow, he's controlling a large device a large piece of flying equipment with the precision of Not a scalpel of a surgeon.

288
00:19:55,306 --> 00:19:57,096
Scott: but No, you don't be more.

289
00:19:57,116 --> 00:20:00,410
Rym: maybe the hammer of a carpenter if there was a scalpel stuck to the end of that.

290
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,601
Scott: Then he did a surgery did a surgery.

291
00:20:02,621 --> 00:20:04,089
Scott: He removed an appendix.

292
00:20:05,252 --> 00:20:08,570
Scott: See, you know you do attach a wiimote to the helicopter, right?

293
00:20:09,071 --> 00:20:12,444
Scott: And then he plays duck hunt or trauma center with it.

294
00:20:13,207 --> 00:20:22,148
Rym: back when I was growing up I knew a couple of helicopter pilots and then in high school My stepdad got a remote-controlled helicopter from my mom as a gift and he was learning how to fly it.

295
00:20:22,993 --> 00:20:25,250
Rym: Helicopters are freaking hard to fly.

296
00:20:26,151 --> 00:20:28,898
Rym: Yeah, so this is especially amazing.

297
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:31,846
Rym: Don't think that helicopters are easy because they're not.

298
00:20:32,067 --> 00:20:33,190
Scott: the airplanes are easy.

299
00:20:33,471 --> 00:20:36,023
Scott: Yeah, airplanes are really and that's yet to fly by instruments.

300
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,268
Scott: That's what most airplane training.

301
00:20:37,328 --> 00:20:40,662
Rym: honestly You know, it's the first time I actually flew a plane.

302
00:20:40,682 --> 00:20:42,530
Rym: I was really short because I was a kid.

303
00:20:42,911 --> 00:20:50,858
Rym: So I'm up there and I'm flying and after about 20 minutes the guy who was teaching me turns and says You can't see out the front window.

304
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:51,680
Rym: Can you?

305
00:20:52,282 --> 00:20:54,327
Rym: and I said, nope, I'm short.

306
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:55,150
Rym: I'm a kid.

307
00:20:55,732 --> 00:20:58,670
Rym: Yeah, I didn't actually say that but I said something to that effect.

308
00:21:00,312 --> 00:21:03,890
Scott: Yeah, I mean it's not really that hard to fly by instruments.

309
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:09,443
Scott: You know, you got the one that shows how much the plane is tilting this way in that way and the other one We don't know anything about planes either.

310
00:21:09,463 --> 00:21:15,650
Scott: Yeah But you know, it's when you can't see anything and you try to look out the window and it's just gray.

311
00:21:16,096 --> 00:21:23,027
Scott: That's when there could be trouble From what I understand from listening because apparently a lot of the big-time podcasters are pilots.

312
00:21:23,207 --> 00:21:24,010
Scott: They all like to fly.

313
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,596
Rym: Well, I was taking flying lessons.

314
00:21:25,656 --> 00:21:26,097
Rym: I was young.

315
00:21:26,117 --> 00:21:31,438
Rym: the problem was it costs a lot of money And we are poor.

316
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,390
Scott: Well, we're not poor but we're not that rich.

317
00:21:33,972 --> 00:21:41,301
Rym: Yeah, I mean if we didn't do geek not what we don't have time we didn't do GeekNights We could take flying lessons, I guess but we couldn't afford them.

318
00:21:41,461 --> 00:21:44,150
Scott: Yeah, we could maybe yeah, I'd have to give something up.

319
00:21:44,855 --> 00:21:48,317
Rym: Yeah, give up podcasting All right.

320
00:21:48,499 --> 00:21:51,196
Scott: Yeah Who do you have a thing today?

321
00:21:51,437 --> 00:21:51,658
Scott: Why?

322
00:21:51,778 --> 00:21:54,870
Rym: I do indeed and it's very much related to science and technology.

323
00:21:54,890 --> 00:22:08,590
Rym: I mean I worked at IBM for many years and one of the areas I had to manage and deal with was a raised floor room Which is you'll have servers, right and they'll be in big racks and the floor is a fake floor and it's these tiles.

324
00:22:08,731 --> 00:22:09,817
Scott: Well, it's not a fake floor.

325
00:22:09,838 --> 00:22:10,824
Scott: I mean you could stand on it.

326
00:22:11,568 --> 00:22:15,106
Rym: Yeah It is a floor but there is another floor under.

327
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:15,890
Scott: it's a trick floor.

328
00:22:15,971 --> 00:22:16,796
Scott: It's not really there.

329
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:18,730
Scott: you step into the room and you fall down and kill yourself.

330
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:30,109
Rym: It's comprised of basically two foot by two foot tiles and you have a little suction thing You can use to pull them up and you put all the wires between all the computers and the networking stuff under there.

331
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:44,810
Rym: Also, you'll usually have big refrigerator things or the H vacuums be plugged into it and that will force cold air under there And then the high pressure will force the cold air through holes in these tiles into the racks to cool down the servers.

332
00:22:45,671 --> 00:22:47,677
Rym: That is how big data centers work.

333
00:22:47,998 --> 00:22:53,189
Rym: if you have data somewhere and it's real data and you're paying a lot of money for it It's probably in a raised floor.

334
00:22:54,651 --> 00:23:02,714
Rym: Most raised floors have drains in this under floor area for such eventualities as Floods.

335
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:06,429
Rym: the data center you were about to see in my thing of the day did not.

336
00:23:06,449 --> 00:23:18,270
Rym: Oh Water got in through a pipe that wasn't sealed properly and It's kind of like Venice only with a lot of people crying.

337
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:24,150
Scott: I'm trying to find out what the parts of a helicopter are on Wikipedia, and I'm not succeeding.

338
00:23:24,432 --> 00:23:24,875
Rym: Well, you know what?

339
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:26,789
Rym: That's fine because it's time for the main bit.

340
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:36,750
Scott: All right, so today we are going to talk to you about image file codec compression formats.

341
00:23:38,253 --> 00:23:39,456
Rym: That was a really lame opener.

342
00:23:39,536 --> 00:23:40,779
Rym: Okay, let's try that again.

343
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,825
Rym: So in continuing our series on codecs.

344
00:23:43,906 --> 00:23:45,890
Rym: We're going to talk about images.

345
00:23:47,372 --> 00:23:47,873
Rym: Was that better?

346
00:23:48,314 --> 00:23:56,449
Scott: I guess I'm gonna talk about all the different image file formats which are used raster image file form It's not vector image file formats.

347
00:23:57,192 --> 00:24:02,010
Rym: Now the reason we're starting with images even though you probably don't care and it doesn't matter to anyone anymore.

348
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:10,860
Rym: It's very simple and easy to go into a lot of detail and all of the concepts we'll talk about today are pretty much the Same when it comes to audio and video.

349
00:24:10,921 --> 00:24:16,010
Scott: Yeah, and before you listen to this episode You should probably listen to part one, which is last Monday.

350
00:24:16,856 --> 00:24:18,247
Scott: Would you ever talk about you know?

351
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,957
Scott: Compression and digital compression.

352
00:24:20,977 --> 00:24:22,502
Rym: Well, we talked about codecs.

353
00:24:22,923 --> 00:24:24,930
Rym: Yeah and lossy and lossless and all that.

354
00:24:25,111 --> 00:24:28,110
Scott: Yeah, we're not gonna re-explain lossy and lossless and other things like that.

355
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:28,792
Scott: You can forget that.

356
00:24:28,852 --> 00:24:39,422
Rym: so for all you young kids out there the internet the world wide web specifically used to not have pictures Used to be text hypertext and nothing more.

357
00:24:39,442 --> 00:24:40,305
Rym: there was you couldn't.

358
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:47,530
Rym: maybe there's an ASCII art But there weren't many pictures, you know computers used to not have pictures.

359
00:24:47,972 --> 00:24:56,990
Scott: It used to just be you know an Apple - which would have green text And if you wanted you could you know, turn some pixels on and off to try to draw something.

360
00:24:57,473 --> 00:25:04,430
Scott: But that was it, you know wasn't until Like the Macintosh computer that you could really have a picture.

361
00:25:05,093 --> 00:25:17,670
Rym: Yeah, and then even then in the early days of the Internet, I mean nowadays It's just oh people use JPEGs gifs pangs But there really weren't a lot of useful widely available formats or image editing programs.

362
00:25:18,373 --> 00:25:25,103
Scott: Yeah, I mean when my got my 486, you know It had OS 2 and it came with this picture of a parrot.

363
00:25:25,164 --> 00:25:26,730
Scott: that was that I guess in those days.

364
00:25:26,772 --> 00:25:37,350
Scott: You know I remember it looking really good because it was one of those multi colored parrots and it was this bitmap of a parrot and it Took up a lot of hard drive space and it was just there, you know to show off the computer.

365
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,415
Scott: Like look at this computer.

366
00:25:38,858 --> 00:25:41,189
Scott: Look how cool a picture of a parrot it can show you.

367
00:25:42,372 --> 00:25:49,235
Scott: and it was just a bitmap of a parrot and the only real image formats then were Bitmap and that was it.

368
00:25:49,596 --> 00:25:49,797
Rym: Yep.

369
00:25:49,837 --> 00:25:51,282
Rym: You might remember it as dot BMP.

370
00:25:51,322 --> 00:25:54,953
Rym: now bitmap is very self-descriptive Bitmap, right?

371
00:25:55,435 --> 00:25:56,117
Rym: What do you think it is?

372
00:25:56,177 --> 00:25:57,321
Rym: It's a map of bits.

373
00:25:57,421 --> 00:26:03,889
Rym: It's just a grid of bits of Pixels that it tells you what color the pixel is.

374
00:26:04,971 --> 00:26:11,970
Scott: Yeah, I mean you have let's say you have three colors, right then you just start, you know, you have a hundred pixel picture.

375
00:26:12,394 --> 00:26:14,229
Scott: It's just a hundred numbers.

376
00:26:14,953 --> 00:26:17,764
Scott: Some of them will be one some of them will be two and some of them will be three.

377
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:20,080
Scott: and you just start drawing in The bottom left.

378
00:26:20,101 --> 00:26:20,689
Scott: you go, right?

379
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:21,787
Scott: Then you go back up.

380
00:26:22,191 --> 00:26:35,970
Scott: You go up one and all the way to the left like a typewriter and then all the way to the right again Drawing, you know red green blue blue blue red red, you know Depending on what the numbers are a bitmap works that way only it can have a lot more than three colors.

381
00:26:36,753 --> 00:26:39,023
Rym: Well, I mean there are different ways to have a bitmap.

382
00:26:39,103 --> 00:26:40,650
Rym: It's just it's more a generic concept.

383
00:26:40,971 --> 00:26:54,088
Scott: Yes, but in terms of the actual bitmap file format, you know, the Microsoft Windows bitmap You know, it can have anywhere between 2-bit or 1-bit which is black and white all the way up to 24-bit color.

384
00:26:54,791 --> 00:27:00,690
Scott: It can't really have alpha channel, which is what let you know, 32-bit color is where you can do transparency.

385
00:27:01,613 --> 00:27:06,750
Scott: But there is a version with transparency that no one uses except for like the Windows startup screen.

386
00:27:07,011 --> 00:27:08,256
Scott: That's where you're gonna see that now.

387
00:27:08,296 --> 00:27:09,561
Rym: You might think hey, that would be fine.

388
00:27:09,622 --> 00:27:11,650
Rym: Why bother using anything else?

389
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:14,132
Rym: I mean it describes an image Theoretically.

390
00:27:14,173 --> 00:27:21,629
Rym: it could describe any image and in order to make the image more good or more precise or more accurate Just increase the number of bits.

391
00:27:22,592 --> 00:27:29,650
Rym: It gets real big real fast large bitmaps that aren't compressed are very large and bitmaps really aren't compressed.

392
00:27:29,951 --> 00:27:34,830
Rym: So you can't say you have a bitmap that is a million pixels by a million pixels and it's red.

393
00:27:35,231 --> 00:27:36,878
Rym: The whole thing is red.

394
00:27:37,099 --> 00:27:38,525
Rym: There's nothing but red pixels.

395
00:27:39,188 --> 00:27:39,750
Rym: by default.

396
00:27:40,131 --> 00:27:44,829
Rym: You can't take advantage of the fact that it's really simple to say what color all the pixels are.

397
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:54,807
Rym: So in the end the file ends up saying pixel 1 is red pixel 2 is red Pixel 3 is red until the 1 million times 1 millionth pixel.

398
00:27:55,288 --> 00:28:00,888
Scott: Yep And if you really if you want to see how big a bitmap can be do some math.

399
00:28:01,189 --> 00:28:04,197
Scott: take a 24 bits which is 3 bytes and then an 800 by 600 image is a 24,000 or 240,000.

400
00:28:04,197 --> 00:28:14,480
Scott: I'm not Yeah 240,000 or 24 that I'm not sure.

401
00:28:14,861 --> 00:28:21,761
Scott: I'm not doing it right now captain math captain math for the win But yeah times 3 bytes.

402
00:28:22,463 --> 00:28:23,407
Scott: That's a lot of bytes.

403
00:28:23,608 --> 00:28:26,769
Scott: That's like 60,000 but that's a lot of bytes.

404
00:28:27,731 --> 00:28:30,863
Rym: Let's just not use examples with numbers Scott.

405
00:28:31,064 --> 00:28:31,505
Scott: Okay.

406
00:28:32,027 --> 00:28:39,630
Rym: Yeah, so Why do we have codecs same reason as with anything else to make things smaller?

407
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,196
Scott: Yeah, there's a reason that you know.

408
00:28:42,357 --> 00:28:45,429
Scott: only MS paint really uses bitmap and nothing else.

409
00:28:46,573 --> 00:28:46,894
Scott: All right.

410
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:48,841
Scott: So what did they come up with next?

411
00:28:49,303 --> 00:28:52,466
Scott: they came up with the TIFF TIFF TIFF TIFF.

412
00:28:53,252 --> 00:28:59,030
Scott: The TIFF is the tagged image file format and it's actually a lot more like a bitmap than you think.

413
00:28:59,752 --> 00:29:05,490
Scott: What they were trying to do is they wanted to make a format of image file for scanning.

414
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:10,949
Scott: They're like anyone who would scan anything in would get a TIFF, you know, that way all the scanners would work together.

415
00:29:11,873 --> 00:29:14,462
Scott: the thing is everyone decided to do something different with TIFF.

416
00:29:15,265 --> 00:29:19,797
Scott: as the name implies it's The tagged image file format.

417
00:29:19,998 --> 00:29:31,330
Scott: a TIFF can actually contain a whole bunch of different pictures and tags that Specify all sorts of different things and different people would make up new tags to do different things in the image file.

418
00:29:32,174 --> 00:29:41,710
Scott: But in the end, you know, they decided okay This guy's using that tag and this software only supports these tags and that guy's ignoring that tag over there.

419
00:29:42,092 --> 00:29:44,769
Scott: These are the only tags we're gonna use and no mother ones.

420
00:29:45,472 --> 00:29:52,494
Scott: So TIFF doesn't do a lot of the amazing things it could do but it still does some pretty cool stuff in General.

421
00:29:52,596 --> 00:29:55,421
Scott: TIFF doesn't is actually Non-compressed.

422
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:56,469
Scott: they're still really big.

423
00:29:57,372 --> 00:30:02,088
Scott: But if you want you can apply what is known as the LZW lossless data compression.

424
00:30:02,108 --> 00:30:08,090
Rym: now I mean there are compression methods for bitmap - don't get us wrong there are but no one really uses them so much.

425
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:12,550
Rym: Well, LZW is fairly widely used in a widely well-known way to compress data.

426
00:30:12,851 --> 00:30:19,730
Scott: Yeah, LZW compression is the thing that made the gift patent and I don't know we can explain how LZW works.

427
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:21,562
Scott: You want to we could.

428
00:30:21,603 --> 00:30:28,070
Scott: it's a little complicated You know what in a computer science way, it compresses things in a way that can now be done better.

429
00:30:28,491 --> 00:30:33,530
Scott: Yeah, basically, I mean it makes it any any data you have no matter what the data is.

430
00:30:34,072 --> 00:30:39,430
Scott: You can use LZW to turn it into less data without losing any information.

431
00:30:39,973 --> 00:30:46,337
Scott: That and LZW is a specific way of doing it with a table and Matching things and it's kind of tricky.

432
00:30:46,678 --> 00:31:02,780
Rym: Yeah, the way most compression format will lossless compression formats work is that they will figure out a pattern that is commonly occurring or a thing that commonly occurs and come up with a shorter way of expressing that a Simple one I could come with right now.

433
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,069
Rym: I'll make up a compression scheme.

434
00:31:04,934 --> 00:31:10,357
Rym: Say you look at an image a bitmap and anytime Multiple pixels in a row.

435
00:31:10,397 --> 00:31:22,082
Rym: anytime a whole line is the same color You have a special number and if you put that number as a pixel It says the whole line that this pixel is in is one color.

436
00:31:22,203 --> 00:31:26,938
Rym: and skip to the next line and then the decoder that's reading This bitmap sees that bit and goes.

437
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,686
Rym: Oh, I know what to do when I see that bit.

438
00:31:29,107 --> 00:31:33,736
Scott: Well that bite Yep Alright, so that's what TIFF is.

439
00:31:33,997 --> 00:31:42,410
Scott: It's basically it's lossless but and it's fancy bitmaps And they're usually also used for like printing and scanning and all that sort of jazz.

440
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:46,884
Rym: Alright, here's the stuff you care about because this is what is on most of the internet.

441
00:31:46,964 --> 00:31:47,887
Rym: gifts and JPEGs.

442
00:31:48,168 --> 00:31:53,130
Scott: the gift Well, we'll talk about the gift the ping and then the JPEG because the get the ping is a lot more similar to the gift.

443
00:31:53,231 --> 00:31:54,849
Rym: Yeah, but the ping is not widely used.

444
00:31:55,271 --> 00:32:00,245
Scott: No, the ping is not as widely used as it should be but it is used very relatively.

445
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:01,950
Scott: what more widely now than before?

446
00:32:02,734 --> 00:32:07,890
Scott: anyway The GIF which is technically the correct pronunciation of GIF is GIF.

447
00:32:08,151 --> 00:32:14,170
Rym: However, that is according to the zealots who decided that sort of thing and the guy who made up the image file format.

448
00:32:14,331 --> 00:32:20,864
Scott: Yeah, but I'm not gonna get into the argument not getting the army But in my opinion GIF is the name of a brand of peanut butter.

449
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:24,915
Scott: Therefore GIF graph Graphics not graphics.

450
00:32:25,336 --> 00:32:30,350
Scott: if it was graphics interchange format, it would be GIF but it's graphics interchange format.

451
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,561
Rym: Therefore yeah, because it's not a word.

452
00:32:32,661 --> 00:32:33,606
Rym: It's an acronym.

453
00:32:33,927 --> 00:32:34,249
Scott: That's right.

454
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:38,743
Rym: Furthermore the vast majority of people in the world say GIF.

455
00:32:38,943 --> 00:32:40,227
Rym: very few people say GIF.

456
00:32:40,247 --> 00:32:42,809
Rym: there have been numerous surveys to this effect.

457
00:32:43,664 --> 00:32:49,550
Scott: anyway What a GIF is is it's just like the other image file formats.

458
00:32:49,731 --> 00:32:53,586
Scott: It's sort of a bitmap, but it saves space in a few ways.

459
00:32:53,747 --> 00:32:54,470
Scott: It doesn't actually.

460
00:32:56,132 --> 00:32:58,903
Scott: It's not a lossy compression it is lossless compression.

461
00:32:59,024 --> 00:33:00,490
Scott: GIF does not lose data.

462
00:33:00,851 --> 00:33:02,697
Scott: Whatever the GIF is is what the GIF is.

463
00:33:02,717 --> 00:33:06,390
Scott: you're not you know, if you turn something into a GIF you don't lose anything.

464
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:09,169
Scott: But there's some limitations.

465
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:12,635
Scott: GIF Can use any.

466
00:33:12,735 --> 00:33:28,540
Scott: you know, there are 24-bit color, which is 16.7 million possible colors You can use but in any one GIF file you can only use 256 colors, so if I were to say draw I don't know.

467
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:36,526
Scott: I take a picture of a flower right and there were 257 shades of green in the leaf of the flower.

468
00:33:37,206 --> 00:33:38,248
Scott: one of them has to go.

469
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:45,230
Scott: that's not compression That's just a limitation of GIF saying you cannot use two more than 256 colors in one GIF picture.

470
00:33:45,451 --> 00:33:51,182
Rym: Now what a lot of people would do is effectively compress an image themselves Like say I have an image that I want to make a GIF out of.

471
00:33:51,504 --> 00:33:58,508
Rym: you can run various Algorithms that will take an image that has more colors figure out a way to express the image in less colors.

472
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:04,830
Rym: now It's lossy because you lose information in the picture, but then you can save it as a GIF which itself is lossless.

473
00:34:05,171 --> 00:34:11,815
Rym: It makes a perfect copy of the lossy thing that you just made Exactly, so you know it.

474
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:17,110
Scott: it's like the GIF format itself is not lossy, but it can't hold a lot.

475
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:21,630
Scott: So you have to cut stuff off of whatever you're working with if you want to stuff it into a GIF.

476
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:29,690
Scott: Now the other thing GIF does is it implies the LZW that we just talked about to make it even smaller.

477
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:34,924
Scott: So you know that was the problem with the whole patent dispute that was going on.

478
00:34:34,964 --> 00:34:40,850
Scott: remember how there was a news a little while ago about all the GIF patents finally expired and now no one cares anymore.

479
00:34:41,971 --> 00:34:45,746
Scott: That was a patent on something in the LZW by the Unisys company.

480
00:34:45,806 --> 00:34:46,469
Scott: blah blah blah blah.

481
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:47,333
Rym: Yeah, don't worry about it.

482
00:34:47,632 --> 00:34:48,155
Rym: No one cares.

483
00:34:48,215 --> 00:34:48,877
Rym: It's gone forever.

484
00:34:49,098 --> 00:34:49,379
Rym: Yep.

485
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,385
Scott: It doesn't mean anything anymore.

486
00:34:51,826 --> 00:34:52,869
Scott: use GIFs all you want.

487
00:34:53,953 --> 00:34:54,717
Rym: Now JPEG.

488
00:34:55,118 --> 00:34:55,902
Scott: well well ping.

489
00:34:55,962 --> 00:34:57,167
Rym: Oh, yeah, you want to talk about ping.

490
00:34:57,207 --> 00:34:58,391
Scott: just a little bit It's all you.

491
00:34:58,732 --> 00:35:02,462
Scott: ping came about because of the patents on GIF.

492
00:35:02,743 --> 00:35:12,480
Scott: all the open source people well a bunch of them Didn't want to use GIF because of those patents that you know wouldn't go away, so they made ping which is portable network graphics.

493
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:22,092
Scott: a Lot of people say PNG because they don't want you to think that they're talking about the program that goes ping ping but most people say ping.

494
00:35:22,132 --> 00:35:27,208
Scott: most people say ping and It's also lossless just like GIF only.

495
00:35:27,368 --> 00:35:31,037
Scott: it can hold any number of colors any number of colors.

496
00:35:31,819 --> 00:35:37,856
Scott: it can also Do what is known as alpha transparency which is 32-bit color.

497
00:35:38,378 --> 00:35:39,040
Scott: see normally?

498
00:35:39,883 --> 00:35:50,199
Scott: When you want to show true color or what is known as true color is 24-bit color two bytes for red two bytes for blue and two bytes for green.

499
00:35:51,121 --> 00:35:56,760
Scott: 32-bit color has two bytes for the alpha channel, which is the amount of transparency.

500
00:35:57,444 --> 00:36:03,839
Scott: See in a GIF you can do transparency But all you can say is this pixel is transparent or it's not?

501
00:36:04,341 --> 00:36:11,068
Rym: So basically what you usually do is just make the background of your GIF the transparent color And now you have a GIF that'll fit in with something.

502
00:36:11,108 --> 00:36:25,716
Scott: yes, but for a ping file since you actually have 32-bit actual alpha you know blending going on you can make some pixels more or less transparent than others Which is really really cool and useful.

503
00:36:26,158 --> 00:36:33,127
Scott: however Internet Explorer doesn't support this as it should so It's not as useful as it could be.

504
00:36:33,247 --> 00:36:36,637
Scott: there was actually a problem like an Internet Explorer 6 and blower.

505
00:36:36,657 --> 00:36:42,184
Scott: if you tried to Use a transparent ping it would just all the transparent parts to be gray And it would suck.

506
00:36:42,808 --> 00:36:58,501
Scott: in Internet Explorer 7 it works better But still not correctly and it really just kind of sucks Because it would be cool if it worked and a lot more people would use ping because it is Technologically superior to GIF, but hey what you gonna Do?

507
00:36:59,003 --> 00:37:01,936
Rym: a lot of things are technologically superior to other things.

508
00:37:01,976 --> 00:37:02,740
Rym: that doesn't mean much.

509
00:37:02,941 --> 00:37:09,279
Scott: I know it's sort of like yeah blu-ray is technologically superior So is the ps3 doesn't mean people are gonna use it.

510
00:37:10,082 --> 00:37:16,203
Rym: So outside of pretty much 4chan at this point the gold standard of images on the internet is of course JPEG.

511
00:37:16,564 --> 00:37:20,855
Scott: yes JPEG is actually useful for photos because it can have lots of colors.

512
00:37:21,176 --> 00:37:24,145
Scott: however it is lossy Dun-dun-dun.

513
00:37:24,386 --> 00:37:28,640
Rym: now lossy is a misnomer not really a misnomer, but a lot of people don't understand.

514
00:37:28,761 --> 00:37:30,390
Rym: They hear lossy, and it freaks them out.

515
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:35,127
Rym: We talked about this last week, but Generally lossy compression formats.

516
00:37:35,408 --> 00:37:38,880
Rym: one can't be applied to data because then you lose the data and the files useless.

517
00:37:39,181 --> 00:37:40,246
Scott: Yeah, I mean you all.

518
00:37:40,286 --> 00:37:43,760
Scott: let me lossy compress my executable for my game.

519
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:47,714
Scott: Oh the game doesn't work because I lost part of it oops.

520
00:37:48,115 --> 00:37:49,420
Scott: That was a good job there.

521
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:55,679
Rym: Yeah, but what it'll usually do is you try to remove data that doesn't matter that you couldn't see.

522
00:37:57,041 --> 00:38:04,046
Rym: So like in an mp3 file it removes the sounds that no human ear could hear anyway or sounds that would be covered up By other sounds and an image.

523
00:38:04,388 --> 00:38:07,219
Rym: it gets rid of fine details that you would never see unless you zoomed in.

524
00:38:07,902 --> 00:38:12,404
Scott: Yeah, if you zoom in on a JPEG it is pretty freakin horrendous Let me tell you.

525
00:38:12,484 --> 00:38:15,779
Scott: but if you look at it just a normal zoom level looks pretty good.

526
00:38:16,402 --> 00:38:37,956
Rym: Yeah, the method that JPEG uses is kind of complicated but the best way I can describe it without going into details that imagine you've got an image and you try to come up with like equations or things that can represent the image with less data required and at the same time you Modify the image slightly to better fit these equations.

527
00:38:37,976 --> 00:38:47,147
Rym: you've come up with Yeah, you do a little mix of both and then you come up with something that you need very little information But yet it'll describe a very big thing.

528
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:48,912
Scott: Yeah, so let me try.

529
00:38:48,932 --> 00:38:51,580
Scott: I'm gonna give you this isn't actually how it works exactly.

530
00:38:51,721 --> 00:38:56,980
Scott: But let's say you've got a picture of a tree right and the tree has brown bark.

531
00:38:57,821 --> 00:39:02,360
Scott: So if you zoom in on the picture of the tree, each pixel is gonna be like a slightly different shade of brown.

532
00:39:03,025 --> 00:39:15,200
Scott: Well, let's say you take a whole bunch of those You take a big piece of the tree there and you average, you know Pick one shade of brown and apply that to the whole area.

533
00:39:15,782 --> 00:39:19,900
Scott: So you're kind of cutting the resolution a bit, you know and getting rid of some of the colors.

534
00:39:20,522 --> 00:39:36,477
Scott: But you change, you know different blocks next to each other so that in the end when you zoom out It looks mostly the same Even though you've you know removed a lot of little dots of different shades and replace them with you know Slightly bigger blocks of similar shades.

535
00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:44,240
Rym: now We talked way before about you know container formats or a format that isn't itself a thing and JPEGs kind of the same way.

536
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:48,030
Rym: The method JPEG uses to do all this isn't actually JPEG.

537
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,113
Rym: It's called what like J fifth.

538
00:39:49,755 --> 00:39:51,540
Scott: I'm not sure it's all crazy.

539
00:39:52,241 --> 00:39:52,783
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

540
00:39:52,803 --> 00:39:57,342
Rym: The thing is I'll tell we'll talk about that a lot more when it comes to video because it matters a lot More.

541
00:39:57,663 --> 00:39:59,512
Scott: yeah container formats don't really matter.

542
00:39:59,552 --> 00:40:00,718
Rym: I mean well for images.

543
00:40:00,758 --> 00:40:08,719
Rym: It doesn't matter I'll know JPEGs just work and there are different ways to make JPEGs different kinds of JPEGs But the truth is they all work.

544
00:40:09,001 --> 00:40:15,479
Rym: You don't have to worry about it pretty much ever unless you're you know in an industry where it matters and then you'll already know.

545
00:40:16,607 --> 00:40:25,260
Scott: the thing is is that JPEG doesn't support, you know, the transparency and stuff that gif does and that's why they still use gifs on the internet.

546
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:34,299
Scott: You know because for a photograph a gif is awesome because in a photograph you've got way too much data that no one could possibly handle and you've got a whole mess of colors.

547
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:39,226
Scott: and The colors aren't always in stark contrast They're usually really close to each other.

548
00:40:39,527 --> 00:40:42,739
Scott: so a JPEG can save you a lot of space while having it still look good.

549
00:40:43,882 --> 00:40:51,260
Scott: But for say images to make up the design of your web page are usually lots of solid colors and different colors and straight lines.

550
00:40:51,541 --> 00:40:56,160
Rym: Yeah, I wasn't really listening to you because I'm poking around on my desk, but I think you said gif and then JPEG.

551
00:40:56,562 --> 00:40:56,925
Scott: Did I?

552
00:40:56,945 --> 00:40:59,260
Rym: I think I'm not gonna stop recording and look back.

553
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:03,059
Scott: JPEG is for photos and gif is for web page design whatever.

554
00:41:03,741 --> 00:41:10,919
Rym: Gif has had a huge resurgence because gif has one thing that JPEG doesn't have you can make animated gifs.

555
00:41:11,322 --> 00:41:12,080
Scott: That's right.

556
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:20,666
Scott: The one advantage of gif is that you can animate it and there is some types of animated pings But no one uses them and nothing supports them.

557
00:41:21,007 --> 00:41:23,756
Rym: And if you want animated JPEG, that's called MPEG.

558
00:41:24,237 --> 00:41:28,670
Rym: Yeah, basically basically We'll get into that in the video days.

559
00:41:28,871 --> 00:41:30,480
Scott: We will get into that in the video days.

560
00:41:31,343 --> 00:41:38,307
Scott: But yeah, there is one new thing called JPEG 2000, which is a new kind of JPEG They came out with in 2000.

561
00:41:38,307 --> 00:41:39,310
Rym: It uses wavelets.

562
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:42,200
Rym: If you want to sound smart just say a wavelet based compression.

563
00:41:42,421 --> 00:41:44,128
Scott: yeah, it's really fancy.

564
00:41:44,329 --> 00:41:53,971
Scott: like you can look at pictures all over the internet and Technically on paper JPEG 2000 is the hot shit Like if we actually use this.

565
00:41:54,272 --> 00:41:56,160
Scott: pictures on the internet would look way better.

566
00:41:56,607 --> 00:42:01,119
Scott: the thing is No one really supports it and no one uses it.

567
00:42:01,601 --> 00:42:03,807
Scott: So it's just sitting around waiting to be used.

568
00:42:04,589 --> 00:42:08,579
Scott: if you want to experiment with it you can but you're on your own.

569
00:42:09,504 --> 00:42:10,127
Rym: I guess the moral.

570
00:42:10,148 --> 00:42:11,475
Rym: I mean we could have skipped this episode.

571
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:12,199
Rym: Here's the moral.

572
00:42:13,141 --> 00:42:18,920
Rym: Image formats and images on computers are actually kind of complex and there's a lot of different formats.

573
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,669
Rym: I mean, there's a lot of things we didn't even talk about.

574
00:42:20,991 --> 00:42:26,449
Scott: like Photoshop has its own internal PSDs gift the GIMP has one.

575
00:42:26,831 --> 00:42:27,593
Scott: What do they call those?

576
00:42:27,654 --> 00:42:28,115
Scott: I forget.

577
00:42:28,135 --> 00:42:34,860
Rym: Yeah, but there's p.m And there's all these different types and there's container formats and some things are used some way and some are used the other ways.

578
00:42:35,121 --> 00:42:38,480
Rym: Sometimes files have the same extension, but they're actually different inside.

579
00:42:39,262 --> 00:42:43,593
Rym: The thing is because images are really mature technology.

580
00:42:43,613 --> 00:42:46,100
Rym: They've been around a long time and the industry is converged.

581
00:42:46,723 --> 00:42:48,915
Rym: They all just work and you don't have to worry about it.

582
00:42:48,955 --> 00:42:53,291
Rym: for the most part We're not there yet when it comes to video.

583
00:42:53,552 --> 00:42:55,600
Rym: we're almost there when it comes to audio.

584
00:42:56,921 --> 00:43:09,473
Rym: So a lot of people now are running into a lot of trouble with video because new codecs come out all the time and things are changing a lot and I Guess someday video might be the way images are.

585
00:43:09,895 --> 00:43:18,702
Rym: but there's also the problem that codecs for video were coming out a lot more frequently than image things did because a lot of us stopped caring about images getting better or Compressed.

586
00:43:19,103 --> 00:43:24,661
Scott: Yeah, that's why if people actually still cared about images that'd be a JPEG 2000 would be used a lot more I think.

587
00:43:24,922 --> 00:43:30,160
Rym: see it's kind of the problem of once things are good enough for them the 85th percentile of people.

588
00:43:30,722 --> 00:43:33,370
Rym: There's not enough pressure to ever go better than that.

589
00:43:33,731 --> 00:43:36,780
Rym: That's part of the reason why I think HDTV is gonna do so poorly.

590
00:43:37,921 --> 00:43:41,373
Scott: Yeah, I mean people are pretty satisfied with their regular old TVs.

591
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:46,140
Scott: how people are satisfied with like, you know If they get a 720p going on they're excited.

592
00:43:46,461 --> 00:43:51,178
Rym: Well, the video store near us has a lot of VHS is they sure do?

593
00:43:51,278 --> 00:43:54,348
Rym: yeah Yeah, I mean VHS is still around.

594
00:43:54,649 --> 00:44:00,715
Rym: DVD is universal blu-ray and HD DVD Aren't selling at all because I mean they're better.

595
00:44:00,816 --> 00:44:01,620
Rym: They're clearly better.

596
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:10,453
Rym: I'll say right now that they're better technology than DVD in many ways just like JPEG 2000 is better than JPEG, but no one cares.

597
00:44:10,513 --> 00:44:13,766
Rym: It's not better enough to change Video codecs.

598
00:44:13,946 --> 00:44:16,539
Rym: everyone that comes out is better enough and people all jump ship.

599
00:44:16,921 --> 00:44:26,526
Scott: Yep, but I think the other thing that support and understand is you know, the major image file formats BMP TIFF gif ping and JPEG.

600
00:44:26,967 --> 00:44:42,120
Scott: you have to understand how each of those is used and how they you know represent images in data and how if they you know Decrease or the amount of data that is stored in order to represent the same image how they do that.

601
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:47,740
Scott: So, you know which format is right for your purpose and the particular image you are handling, you know.

602
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,900
Scott: And whether you want to you know, maybe you have a picture you took and you don't want to lose any resolution.

603
00:44:53,121 --> 00:44:58,160
Scott: Well, you might want to save it as a bitmap and not put it in a JPEG and lose a bunch of your resolution.

604
00:44:58,683 --> 00:45:10,280
Rym: Well, I mean what most people do and I do this with audio too like I do GeekNights and I save the Original edited file that was all waves as a flack which is a lossless thing and I have this flack archive.

605
00:45:11,123 --> 00:45:19,580
Rym: And then the if the ones I give to people or put online I can press lossily with mp3 But I keep my master lossless around in case I want to do something someday.

606
00:45:19,932 --> 00:45:23,792
Scott: Yep It's important to understand the uses of these different formats and how they work.

607
00:45:24,073 --> 00:45:34,400
Scott: if you plan on doing anything with images on Computers or else you're gonna have some troubles along the way now if you found that boring at all That's probably because we stretched it into a longer episode.

608
00:45:35,341 --> 00:45:37,469
Rym: Then we otherwise would have had we sure did.

609
00:45:37,549 --> 00:45:44,314
Scott: the other thing is we know a lot more about video and audio than we know About images partly because images stop being an issue in the 90s.

610
00:45:44,495 --> 00:45:54,914
Scott: Yeah, so I stopped paying attention I stopped learning about them because it was just sort of this obvious duh kind of thing I mean, I remember like reading about JPEG and using JPEG and I was amazed by it.

611
00:45:54,955 --> 00:45:56,499
Rym: and now I just don't give a shit.

612
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:06,099
Scott: Yeah now it's like back in the days that when I was trying to make web pages with geocities I would have to pay attention to like how big my gifts were and make them smaller because they wouldn't fit.

613
00:46:06,462 --> 00:46:07,880
Scott: Yeah, two megabytes of space.

614
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:15,604
Rym: I'd sit there for five minutes saving a picture and all these different levels of JPEG compression until it was just good enough to Get the smallest picture.

615
00:46:15,624 --> 00:46:18,734
Scott: I could trying to upload my 500k JPEG up there.

616
00:46:18,754 --> 00:46:23,778
Scott: I'd be like, holy crap I'm wasting a quarter of my space just so I can have one photo on the page.

617
00:46:23,939 --> 00:46:27,135
Rym: yet Now I upload 50 megabyte mp3 files and don't even blink.

618
00:46:27,617 --> 00:46:33,160
Scott: Yeah, so It's just something that people stop caring about but it's still important to know.

619
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,007
Scott: I mean, I don't even pay attention anymore.

620
00:46:35,067 --> 00:46:36,773
Scott: Like hey, are they using gifs?

621
00:46:36,854 --> 00:46:37,636
Scott: Are they using JPEGs?

622
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:41,594
Scott: I don't know, but it used to be an image used to be an image.

623
00:46:41,876 --> 00:46:45,068
Scott: It used to be Important he used to be an issue.

624
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:46,493
Scott: It's just not an issue anymore.

625
00:46:46,754 --> 00:46:50,386
Rym: Yeah, it also doesn't help that we're Absolutely exhausted.

626
00:46:50,787 --> 00:46:52,874
Scott: Yeah, we kind of you know, whatever.

627
00:46:52,914 --> 00:46:54,680
Rym: I think this episode was boring as shit.

628
00:46:55,081 --> 00:46:55,784
Scott: Yeah, it was.

629
00:46:55,904 --> 00:46:57,730
Scott: it wasn't exciting as it could have been.

630
00:46:58,051 --> 00:46:59,557
Rym: so I guess what do you guys want on Mondays?

631
00:46:59,597 --> 00:47:00,500
Rym: informative or funny?

632
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,829
Rym: Cuz I'm fine with just skipping this whole Kodak business.

633
00:47:03,311 --> 00:47:03,612
Scott: I don't know.

634
00:47:03,652 --> 00:47:05,540
Scott: I still think we should the audio in the video.

635
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,968
Scott: I think we have better stuff to say.

636
00:47:07,088 --> 00:47:09,199
Rym: I don't have anything interesting to say about the audio.

637
00:47:09,962 --> 00:47:18,947
Rym: I could either talk and because I actually know a lot about the audio I could talk in stupid mathematical detail about mp3s or I can just not talk about it.

638
00:47:19,007 --> 00:47:19,911
Rym: There's really nothing.

639
00:47:20,654 --> 00:47:22,080
Rym: I don't think any of you'll be interested in.

640
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,091
Rym: I mean are you do you want to know a lot about how mp3 works?

641
00:47:24,111 --> 00:47:26,325
Scott: I Think people are.

642
00:47:26,365 --> 00:47:27,674
Scott: they seem to be interested before.

643
00:47:27,695 --> 00:47:28,420
Rym: I don't know.

644
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,700
Scott: I just think it's like I don't want to think of something else to talk about on Monday.

645
00:47:31,821 --> 00:47:35,240
Rym: Well, just tell geeky stories or something about computers.

646
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:37,687
Scott: geeky story where I think I just.

647
00:47:38,029 --> 00:47:44,230
Rym: I just think and I want to hear what our listeners think that today's episode was Incredibly boring and not at all entertaining, but that's just me.

648
00:47:44,451 --> 00:47:45,373
Scott: Yeah, I think it was.

649
00:47:45,393 --> 00:47:49,586
Scott: I mean, but I don't think it's because It's about codex.

650
00:47:49,606 --> 00:47:52,200
Scott: I think it's about you know, just the image ones in particular.

651
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,990
Rym: We know because I don't think we'll be any better with audio or video.

652
00:47:55,291 --> 00:47:55,893
Scott: I think we will.

653
00:47:56,094 --> 00:48:05,700
Scott: I definitely won't be with video Yeah, it'll just be informative Yeah, but that's something people really want to know about the video that's that's what they all have problems with.

654
00:48:06,001 --> 00:48:09,596
Rym: Yeah, except whenever people ask you for help with codex you just say yeah, you're stupid.

655
00:48:09,696 --> 00:48:10,520
Rym: You don't actually help them.

656
00:48:10,901 --> 00:48:15,760
Scott: That's because the answer is it's going to be a problem unless you use Linux or something.

657
00:48:16,425 --> 00:48:18,300
Rym: That's then our episode is gonna be useless.

658
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,280
Scott: Well, I'm not gonna tell them how to get codex.

659
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,685
Rym: I think that's the only thing people want to know.

660
00:48:22,067 --> 00:48:24,616
Rym: you realize that most people couldn't give a shit.

661
00:48:24,938 --> 00:48:26,583
Rym: what any Codec out there is.

662
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:27,527
Rym: they only care about.

663
00:48:27,807 --> 00:48:29,914
Rym: how come the MKV file I have won't play?

664
00:48:30,195 --> 00:48:31,620
Rym: how come the subtitles won't play?

665
00:48:31,841 --> 00:48:33,066
Rym: How come this is?

666
00:48:33,106 --> 00:48:34,794
Scott: but this isn't a show for most people.

667
00:48:34,814 --> 00:48:35,457
Scott: This is Monday.

668
00:48:35,517 --> 00:48:36,260
Scott: This is GeekNights.

669
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,870
Scott: It's a science technology or you teach you about science technology.

670
00:48:39,131 --> 00:48:41,160
Scott: No the stuff that nerds and geeks care about.

671
00:48:41,783 --> 00:48:44,859
Rym: Yeah, except I don't think people want to hear us be informative about stuff like that.

672
00:48:45,801 --> 00:48:47,269
Scott: So do you want to not have Monday?

673
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:49,140
Rym: No, I'm saying I don't think cuz I don't know.

674
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,509
Rym: I want to hear what our listeners have to say.

675
00:48:50,529 --> 00:48:56,700
Rym: Yeah, Monday is fine But being dry and informative and not even that informative about a topic that's really boring.

676
00:48:57,365 --> 00:48:58,857
Scott: Well, this this is a you know images.

677
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,490
Scott: I think we is pretty boring because we didn't know.

678
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:03,660
Rym: I think if we knew more then why do we even do it?

679
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:09,220
Scott: This is all you because that we had to do, you know, try it was a trifecta the whole episode.

680
00:49:09,341 --> 00:49:13,160
Rym: All I was trying to do is rationalize the fact that we were doing this boring ass episode.

681
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:16,137
Scott: Well, I think also part of the episode was that you weren't paying attention you were.

682
00:49:16,217 --> 00:49:16,559
Scott: I am in.

683
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:18,527
Rym: people Say I didn't read anything.

684
00:49:18,567 --> 00:49:19,471
Rym: I was working all day.

685
00:49:19,591 --> 00:49:21,660
Rym: I don't care about these formats at all.

686
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:25,313
Scott: So you're like, oh this episode is boring because I didn't put any effort in.

687
00:49:25,333 --> 00:49:26,095
Rym: Yeah, but here's the thing.

688
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:31,420
Rym: even if it was informative I like if I was listening to it because I really didn't know I wouldn't have been I wouldn't have cared.

689
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,270
Rym: It's kind of podcast.

690
00:49:32,331 --> 00:49:32,978
Rym: I would have turned off.

691
00:49:33,441 --> 00:49:35,186
Scott: Maybe if you know you would have put.

692
00:49:35,266 --> 00:49:39,719
Scott: you're complaining about an episode that you didn't put any effort into or contribute anything to.

693
00:49:39,739 --> 00:49:42,788
Scott: yeah You're like, hey, I didn't do anything for this episode.

694
00:49:42,809 --> 00:49:46,219
Rym: therefore it sucks now cuz if I contributed more would have been just as boring.

695
00:49:47,981 --> 00:49:50,512
Rym: Yeah, okay, whatever cuz we would have said the same stuff.

696
00:49:50,532 --> 00:49:51,597
Rym: just I would have said half of it.

697
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,640
Rym: Yeah anyway Tell us what you think about this episode.

698
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:00,440
Rym: And if you want us to keep going with this codec thing that I think is kind of boring we need Monday ideas.

699
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:05,926
Scott: And I'm I think that when you talk about audio and video It won't be as boring.

700
00:50:06,067 --> 00:50:13,637
Scott: only if we talk about how to get the codecs and install them You go and download them and install them from where from any number of websites.

701
00:50:13,657 --> 00:50:14,400
Scott: No people don't know.

702
00:50:15,662 --> 00:50:18,193
Rym: You know how many people have trouble playing MKV files?

703
00:50:18,213 --> 00:50:20,886
Scott: I Don't know what their problem is.

704
00:50:21,026 --> 00:50:22,313
Rym: Yeah, but Scott the thing is use it.

705
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:25,670
Scott: don't use Windows Media Player Don't use QuickTime player.

706
00:50:25,952 --> 00:50:27,360
Scott: Don't use real player.

707
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:29,586
Scott: Use VLC or M player.

708
00:50:29,867 --> 00:50:31,491
Scott: There you go the end.

709
00:50:32,032 --> 00:50:32,434
Scott: Okay.

710
00:50:32,855 --> 00:50:34,740
Rym: Anyway, anyway, just tell us what you think.

711
00:50:35,522 --> 00:50:36,204
Rym: I'm curious.

712
00:50:36,264 --> 00:50:38,109
Scott: lots of Monday and Thursday ideas.

713
00:50:38,149 --> 00:50:39,754
Scott: We don't need Tuesday and Wednesday ideas.

714
00:50:39,794 --> 00:50:40,616
Scott: that seems to be all.

715
00:50:40,696 --> 00:50:41,739
Scott: anyone can provide us.
