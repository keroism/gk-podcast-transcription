00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,957
Rym: It's Wednesday July 26th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,379 --> 00:00:18,940
Rym: tonight We give you an overview of all that is slayers that classic fantasy comedy franchise.

3
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:21,137
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:22,168 --> 00:00:29,220
Rym: If I sound slightly weird today It's because the novocaine from when I went to the dentist earlier hasn't quite worn off and part of my mouth feels kind of weird.

5
00:00:29,922 --> 00:00:32,549
Scott: So who had zero cavities when they went to the dentist?

6
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,985
Rym: actually Scott the thing is my cavity Grim.

7
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,179
Rym: the funny thing is this this cavity.

8
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:48,160
Rym: I basically for the last like six or seven years every dentist I've had has always said I want to keep an eye on this one tooth.

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,418
Rym: it looks like it's gonna get a cavity soon, but they kept saying that and it never got a cavity.

10
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,360
Rym: and Finally my latest dentist I went in and he said the same thing and I said you're sure it's not a cavity.

11
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,705
Rym: He said it's real close.

12
00:01:00,745 --> 00:01:01,568
Rym: It's hard to tell.

13
00:01:01,588 --> 00:01:03,936
Rym: and I said, you know what just fill it in.

14
00:01:04,277 --> 00:01:04,938
Rym: So he filled it in.

15
00:01:06,243 --> 00:01:07,940
Scott: You see I've had two different.

16
00:01:08,342 --> 00:01:11,634
Scott: I've noticed two different ways that dentist can tell if it's a cavity or not.

17
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,905
Rym: the first he did the x-ray because he couldn't tell From looking at it.

18
00:01:14,025 --> 00:01:16,000
Scott: Yeah, there's the x-ray which is the easiest way.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,160
Scott: You just freakin look which is almost the same as looking at it.

20
00:01:19,241 --> 00:01:29,755
Scott: but yeah the the other way is they have this little sonar device that they can use and they hope they put it on your tooth and They push a button and a number shows up on this little LCD screen.

21
00:01:29,855 --> 00:01:30,096
Scott: Really?

22
00:01:30,116 --> 00:01:31,220
Rym: I've never seen anything like that.

23
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:38,209
Scott: They used it on me once and if it beeps and the number goes over a certain I guess I don't know what the limit is like 70 or 80.

24
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:38,851
Scott: I don't know.

25
00:01:39,213 --> 00:01:40,980
Scott: then it's a cavity that needs filling.

26
00:01:41,442 --> 00:01:46,985
Rym: I remember when I was a kid the way the dentist seemed to do it was he'd scrape metal over my teeth and anytime it Stuck somewhere.

27
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:49,199
Rym: He'd examine that area more closely and look for a cavity.

28
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,734
Rym: Yeah Yeah, but the thing was I had my teeth sealed.

29
00:01:54,795 --> 00:01:55,980
Rym: we talked about this in the dentistry episode.

30
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:57,038
Rym: I got sealants back there.

31
00:01:57,642 --> 00:02:02,680
Rym: The cavity is right at the edge of the sealant and it looks like because the sealant so old that it had retracted.

32
00:02:02,842 --> 00:02:08,009
Rym: So there was a hole there And there's no way you can brush a hole in your tooth.

33
00:02:08,371 --> 00:02:09,693
Scott: I see you have an excuse.

34
00:02:09,734 --> 00:02:10,055
Scott: Mr.

35
00:02:10,235 --> 00:02:10,596
Scott: Brush.

36
00:02:10,917 --> 00:02:11,799
Scott: Yeah brush a lot.

37
00:02:12,221 --> 00:02:15,695
Rym: However, however, I don't have an excuse for like the other four cavities.

38
00:02:15,755 --> 00:02:16,900
Rym: I got like nine years ago.

39
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,093
Scott: Yeah, I still have only had two and the first one was when I was 21.

40
00:02:21,093 --> 00:02:27,070
Rym: So I've got a grand total of Seven But two of those are technically sealants.

41
00:02:27,752 --> 00:02:34,460
Rym: Anyway, I have two other Leading bits that I would like to talk about because today wasn't a very interesting day.

42
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:49,812
Rym: We made BLT's for dinner and they were awesome, but mmm inexplicably Somehow despite the fact that Scott and I probably eat more bread in our household than any other household near us You know, it's the bottom of the food pyramid.

43
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,540
Scott: You're supposed to eat more bread than anything else.

44
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,488
Rym: Yeah, but what about Atkins?

45
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:55,336
Scott: Oh, it's bullshit.

46
00:02:55,356 --> 00:03:08,348
Rym: Oh Yeah, so I now make lunches at work because there's a fridge and I wanted to save some money and also because the food near my work is A lot more expensive than the food near IBM used to be.

47
00:03:09,111 --> 00:03:11,439
Rym: so I took my loaf of bread from home to work.

48
00:03:12,162 --> 00:03:20,146
Rym: Scott also took his loaf of bread from home to work and when we went to make BLT's we had no Bread no B.

49
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:21,512
Scott: It was just gonna be an LT.

50
00:03:21,612 --> 00:03:22,757
Rym: Well, the B stands for bacon.

51
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,048
Rym: All right You know, you know what?

52
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:31,675
Rym: I'd make plenty of bacon I'd make fun of you But I was about to say the exact same thing and the only reason I didn't say it?

53
00:03:31,695 --> 00:03:35,158
Rym: because you said it first and my brain Figured out what was wrong with that statement before?

54
00:03:37,444 --> 00:03:42,606
Scott: so so we were gonna make some BB LT's and Well, well a to be BLT.

55
00:03:43,027 --> 00:03:44,250
Rym: So I lost our to be.

56
00:03:44,431 --> 00:03:47,820
Rym: I made a bblc instead with some cucumber because we didn't have any tomato.

57
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:52,440
Scott: Either I had one piece of tomato on each because you stole it from the salad.

58
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:52,922
Rym: I made.

59
00:03:52,943 --> 00:03:56,259
Scott: that's right and the tomatoes on the plant on the back porch aren't ready yet.

60
00:03:56,782 --> 00:04:00,519
Rym: So I ran to the local key food to get some bread.

61
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:04,811
Rym: now I don't want to rip on mom-and-pop chains or anything.

62
00:04:04,831 --> 00:04:07,079
Scott: So key food isn't a mom-and-pop chain.

63
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:10,040
Rym: Yeah Well, I didn't realize that until I saw one in New York City.

64
00:04:10,243 --> 00:04:11,218
Rym: I didn't know it was a chain.

65
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:19,613
Rym: But people who visited us asked us why we don't go to the local grocery store and why we drive You know 15 minutes away to bigger grocery stores.

66
00:04:20,255 --> 00:04:21,360
Scott: key food sucks.

67
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:26,740
Rym: Every time we've gone there something horrible has happened.

68
00:04:27,243 --> 00:04:29,399
Rym: I mean the first time we ever went to this key food.

69
00:04:30,022 --> 00:04:34,280
Rym: They didn't have a price on something that I wanted to buy and then they didn't know what to do.

70
00:04:34,461 --> 00:04:42,500
Rym: So they were like, well, we can't sell it to you even though you know It was out in a display and it was a thing I needed to barbecue and I was only buying stuff to barbecue.

71
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:46,040
Rym: So I basically said well if you can't sell me that I don't need any of this stuff.

72
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,956
Rym: And they got really mad and they just they couldn't deal with this situation.

73
00:04:50,176 --> 00:04:51,060
Rym: They could have named a price.

74
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,965
Rym: I probably just paid it.

75
00:04:52,829 --> 00:05:06,820
Rym: then we went a couple weeks later and Someone in the parking lot rammed a shopping cart into Scott's old car like straight up and they yeah, I remember no They backed up and they jammed a parking shopping cart into the back of your car.

76
00:05:07,202 --> 00:05:08,933
Rym: And then we talked about how much we hated the key food.

77
00:05:08,954 --> 00:05:12,379
Scott: I Remember that particular incident, but okay, you really don't remember that.

78
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,192
Rym: No, it scratched the hell up out of your bag bumper and everything that remember.

79
00:05:16,212 --> 00:05:18,600
Rym: you bitched about it for like a day did?

80
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,142
Scott: I don't remember.

81
00:05:19,162 --> 00:05:19,745
Rym: Yes, you did.

82
00:05:19,805 --> 00:05:20,669
Scott: I think you're making it up.

83
00:05:20,749 --> 00:05:22,516
Rym: No, I'm really not doesn't matter.

84
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:23,420
Scott: That was an old shit guy.

85
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:24,291
Rym: Yeah, it was.

86
00:05:24,331 --> 00:05:27,967
Rym: it was the old tempo Anyway, and food sucks every time.

87
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:31,540
Scott: I didn't even have all the different like grocery products that we need.

88
00:05:31,941 --> 00:05:35,878
Rym: so today I go there to buy bread and I see oh I'll buy some Kaiser rolls and they're in these bags.

89
00:05:35,938 --> 00:05:40,526
Rym: and I look and the bag is buzzing and Look and there's a fly in it.

90
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:44,358
Rym: and then I look closer and there's a million baby flies in it, too.

91
00:05:45,222 --> 00:05:47,659
Rym: And I know there's probably maggots in there as well.

92
00:05:48,383 --> 00:05:57,970
Rym: And I I just stared at it in disbelief Went and found some bread that there's no way the key food could have tainted Bought it and I'm never going back to that place.

93
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,098
Scott: No matter what bread from a commercial bakery.

94
00:06:00,118 --> 00:06:02,734
Rym: Yes I am never going back to that grocery store.

95
00:06:02,815 --> 00:06:06,504
Scott: Good God Uh Key food.

96
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:09,875
Scott: and in Queens, New York key food is like the grocery store.

97
00:06:09,915 --> 00:06:11,360
Scott: There isn't any other choice.

98
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,844
Rym: Really, I drive past two key foods when I go between my office and Yonkers and one of the hospitals I work at in the Bronx.

99
00:06:16,884 --> 00:06:19,133
Scott: Yeah, it's like this supermarket, but it's not super.

100
00:06:19,193 --> 00:06:22,320
Rym: It's just a regular market Yeah, but it's not good.

101
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:29,347
Rym: Like usually when I think of a market I think of like those small specialty markets that have higher prices But higher quality specialty goods.

102
00:06:29,447 --> 00:06:31,798
Scott: No, those are like the ultra small market.

103
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,064
Scott: Yeah That's a small market.

104
00:06:34,425 --> 00:06:35,629
Scott: we go to a large market.

105
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:36,492
Scott: this is just a market.

106
00:06:36,914 --> 00:06:38,740
Rym: but I got another quick story today.

107
00:06:38,801 --> 00:06:39,900
Rym: You know all these balloons.

108
00:06:43,062 --> 00:06:53,411
Rym: So as you all know I work in hospitals and today I had to go to a neurological intensive care unit which was one Exactly the way you see these sorts of things in movies.

109
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:55,340
Rym: It was really kind of cool to be in there though.

110
00:06:55,501 --> 00:06:56,084
Scott: Hey weren't there?

111
00:06:56,466 --> 00:06:59,220
Scott: isn't that where they put brain-dead people and all sorts of things?

112
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,320
Rym: It was people who had a lot like head injuries and all sorts of stuffs and final injuries.

113
00:07:03,922 --> 00:07:07,394
Rym: I felt bad because at one time I wanted to be professional because this is.

114
00:07:07,414 --> 00:07:13,548
Rym: I'm sent here to meet with these very well-known Very skilled doctors like this.

115
00:07:13,628 --> 00:07:15,695
Rym: nobody knows like these doctors are.

116
00:07:16,276 --> 00:07:24,520
Rym: I guess they're not famous But within the community of the specific things they do they're fairly well known for their research and they're really knowledgeable really smart dudes.

117
00:07:25,165 --> 00:07:31,740
Rym: They're also really a lot older than me and Even though I'm a technology Professional like this is my job and I do this sort of thing all the time.

118
00:07:32,183 --> 00:07:38,754
Rym: When I walked into this room and I was standing around there's all these Doctors who save lives every day and they all introduce themselves like hi.

119
00:07:38,855 --> 00:07:40,320
Rym: I am doctor blah blah blah blah PhD.

120
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:48,484
Rym: Hi, I'm doctor blah blah blah specialist and blah and I'm like, hey, I'm the computer guy And you know what.

121
00:07:48,684 --> 00:07:53,760
Scott: you might not know anything about neurological whatnot, but I'm sure they don't know jack about computers.

122
00:07:54,002 --> 00:08:03,880
Rym: no, they don't but you know what I. It's weird, but I don't begrudge them not knowing about computers at all because they know that they're so smart.

123
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:06,360
Scott: They should just be able to figure out the basics of compute.

124
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:06,982
Scott: You know, like.

125
00:08:07,484 --> 00:08:15,986
Scott: they don't have to be experts like we are but they have to know more than the average person just by their Shear, you know Minimal level of intelligence.

126
00:08:16,187 --> 00:08:18,113
Rym: It seems that they from what I gather.

127
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:20,200
Rym: I don't think they even have time to use computers.

128
00:08:20,441 --> 00:08:22,187
Scott: Wow, the how do they do doctoring?

129
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:25,440
Rym: because they do the doctoring and other people take care of all the paperwork.

130
00:08:26,761 --> 00:08:51,699
Rym: But there they were really smart dudes and it was just weird to be in this in this place Which is a foreign and somewhat frightening sad place full of very injured people Talking to a bunch of extremely highly paid extremely well-educated intelligent men, and I'm just the computer, dude I'm dressed in like a silk black shirt and I got my little locus klein pin and they're all in Business suits with lab coats over them and it was fun

131
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:53,543
Scott: Mm-hmm.

132
00:08:53,764 --> 00:08:54,347
Scott: What did they say?

133
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,620
Rym: a bunch of stuff that no one cares about?

134
00:08:57,841 --> 00:09:02,635
Rym: I'd have to tell you the details of my job, which is actually not that interesting and probably very tedious.

135
00:09:02,655 --> 00:09:03,799
Scott: Did they say anything doctory?

136
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,011
Rym: Actually before they started the thing talking to me.

137
00:09:08,372 --> 00:09:17,280
Rym: They were in the middle of a conversation and I Barely unders like now I know how a lot of our friends who aren't so technological as us feel When they're sitting in the room.

138
00:09:17,346 --> 00:09:31,074
Rym: well like me and Scott and Alex and James are talking about this stuff because I was standing there politely waiting for them to be finished and I understood all of the individual words they said but combined they meant almost nothing to me.

139
00:09:31,094 --> 00:09:31,936
Rym: Haha.

140
00:09:32,378 --> 00:09:32,799
Scott: It's another.

141
00:09:32,859 --> 00:09:36,798
Rym: it's like Okay, yeah, I'm done with that.

142
00:09:37,864 --> 00:09:39,069
Rym: That story doesn't actually go anywhere.

143
00:09:39,229 --> 00:09:40,234
Rym: I just thought it was interesting.

144
00:09:40,776 --> 00:09:41,640
Scott: You know what I got today.

145
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:45,480
Scott: I did more work today than I've done any day in the past many months.

146
00:09:45,822 --> 00:09:47,734
Rym: You know what going to that meeting was the only work.

147
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:53,272
Rym: I really did today Because all the work I've got to do was canceled or delayed or something.

148
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:53,753
Rym: I got nothing.

149
00:09:54,034 --> 00:09:55,117
Scott: Yeah Wow.

150
00:09:55,357 --> 00:09:57,524
Scott: Yeah, just wow All right.

151
00:09:57,584 --> 00:10:07,280
Scott: Anyway, you got some anime news, I believe All right, the Fullmetal Alchemist movie which the verdict is sort of out on whether it's actually worth watching or not.

152
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:13,240
Rym: Yeah, we haven't seen it yet So we can't make an opinion, but I have not heard anyone say anything positive about it.

153
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:15,813
Scott: Yeah, you think like with some anime movies.

154
00:10:15,873 --> 00:10:17,160
Scott: Everyone's all excited about it.

155
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,166
Scott: You know the heat talking about it and I was.

156
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:28,116
Scott: I was really before the movie came out people were saying ooh a Fullmetal Alchemist movie but it was emphasis on the Fullmetal Alchemist like hooray Fullmetal Alchemist.

157
00:10:28,156 --> 00:10:34,294
Scott: we like that a lot and There wasn't so much, you know after the movie came out people going.

158
00:10:34,535 --> 00:10:35,558
Scott: Oh, you got to see this movie.

159
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:37,528
Scott: It's so great It just kind of people stop talking.

160
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:47,840
Scott: Yeah, everyone who saw it basically told us The point is is that Funimation Films is putting it out in movie theaters in the US.

161
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:58,427
Scott: We don't know what theaters but we do know that the show times are Friday August 25th at 930 at night Saturday August 26 at 2 p.m.

162
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:03,840
Scott: And Saturday August 26 at 930 p.m There's gonna be basically three showings.

163
00:11:04,721 --> 00:11:06,431
Scott: Hopefully there's a theater near you.

164
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:07,719
Scott: if you want to go see it.

165
00:11:08,121 --> 00:11:11,352
Rym: Well, hopefully it'll be in New York City cuz I'll probably head down there and see it.

166
00:11:12,055 --> 00:11:13,440
Scott: Maybe it depends how much it is.

167
00:11:14,601 --> 00:11:15,324
Rym: It's New York City.

168
00:11:15,344 --> 00:11:16,468
Rym: It'll be like 15 bucks.

169
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:17,311
Rym: Like every movie is.

170
00:11:17,331 --> 00:11:18,958
Scott: I don't know if it's worth 15 bucks.

171
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,704
Scott: 15 bucks I could buy the damn DVD.

172
00:11:20,965 --> 00:11:22,010
Rym: Yeah, I mean it is.

173
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,680
Rym: I mean apple seed was really worth seeing in the theater.

174
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:30,049
Rym: I mean that was really cool and ghost in the shell innocence was Absolutely worth seeing in the theater.

175
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:32,000
Rym: That movie was just a spectacle of animation.

176
00:11:32,843 --> 00:11:34,347
Rym: I don't know about the FMA movie in terms.

177
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:34,909
Rym: I mean it doesn't.

178
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,700
Rym: it's not like FMA was particularly pretty or well drawn.

179
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,959
Rym: It was actually very generic in the way it was drawn.

180
00:11:41,482 --> 00:11:45,238
Scott: Well, the the trailer for the movie makes it look a lot better.

181
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:45,961
Rym: true It does.

182
00:11:45,981 --> 00:11:47,768
Scott: the movie was a much higher production value.

183
00:11:48,109 --> 00:11:48,451
Scott: Of course.

184
00:11:48,471 --> 00:11:58,139
Rym: The new Funimation trailer is kind of like Yeah, like trailers I'd seen before made me more excited and then that trailer made me less excited.

185
00:12:00,736 --> 00:12:02,830
Rym: Yeah Yeah, once we see the movie we'll review it.

186
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:06,990
Rym: we've had it on our computer for a long time But we never actually watched it.

187
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:15,139
Rym: and then we finally said alright tonight's the night We're going to watch it and then we learned that the subtitle track was broken and then I fixed it But it was then and watched it since then.

188
00:12:15,245 --> 00:12:21,837
Rym: Yeah We like we the the spark of let's watch it came and then we failed at watching it and then the spark died and I don't Think it's coming back.

189
00:12:22,702 --> 00:12:25,600
Rym: But anyway instead of a second news now you'll all groan.

190
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:30,036
Rym: I have a geek back and the verdict seems to be that most of you don't like the geek back so much.

191
00:12:30,096 --> 00:12:32,411
Rym: or you want him at the end of the Show or something or you want him if it doesn't.

192
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:33,599
Rym: take away from the news, but one.

193
00:12:34,441 --> 00:12:36,747
Rym: There wasn't so much anime news that we would talk about.

194
00:12:36,807 --> 00:12:41,924
Rym: interestingly - there wasn't enough news in the real world that we're ready to talk about.

195
00:12:41,965 --> 00:12:42,453
Rym: yet today.

196
00:12:43,382 --> 00:12:47,240
Scott: Yeah, there are some big news is but I think they're gonna wait till tomorrow and next Monday.

197
00:12:47,441 --> 00:12:56,519
Rym: yeah, cuz I guess I've gotten to the point where I kind of want to save news that are worthwhile and Especially until everyone out there who listens knows something about it or at least has heard of it.

198
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:02,838
Rym: that way We don't have to spend so much time explaining what the news is and we can spend more time talking about the ramifications And or arguing with each other.

199
00:13:04,441 --> 00:13:08,360
Rym: But before I do this geek back, I'd like to say that we may have gotten our first hate mail.

200
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:19,949
Rym: Yeah, someone did send us something that is kind of like a hate mail But it it's weird because one he accused us of being homosexuals awesome And - he makes some pretty.

201
00:13:19,969 --> 00:13:24,863
Rym: I guess I don't want to say valid but definitely Understandable criticisms.

202
00:13:25,324 --> 00:13:27,710
Scott: Yeah, I I replied and started a little conversation.

203
00:13:28,961 --> 00:13:32,653
Scott: Just to you know, add some meat to the email and we'll get to it tomorrow.

204
00:13:32,874 --> 00:13:37,824
Rym: Yes, we will but suffice to say It's gonna be fun Mm-hmm.

205
00:13:38,368 --> 00:13:39,920
Rym: I don't know if it's actually a hate mail or not.

206
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:46,324
Rym: I'm still not absolutely sure if he's kidding or what but he did say that it was more of an Irritation mail.

207
00:13:46,364 --> 00:13:53,169
Scott: like a hate mail is usually when someone hates you this guy is sort of Irritated with us, but he still is a fan of our show.

208
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:56,220
Rym: So yeah, well, he didn't actually sign his email either.

209
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:59,693
Rym: Yeah, he did what like an uppercase I or a lowercase L.

210
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,540
Scott: Yeah, that's his is like screen name or whatever.

211
00:14:02,263 --> 00:14:03,447
Rym: That's not a screen name.

212
00:14:03,568 --> 00:14:05,054
Rym: one character is not a screen name.

213
00:14:05,074 --> 00:14:06,640
Scott: Well, you can see it in his email address.

214
00:14:07,044 --> 00:14:08,620
Rym: Yeah, but still okay, whatever.

215
00:14:09,143 --> 00:14:16,838
Rym: Anyway, this is an old geek back We got a while ago and it's also kind of a news because anime Expo happened and we did weeks

216
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:17,520
Scott: and weeks ago

217
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:28,600
Rym: and we didn't really talk about it so much and we got a feedback from one of our listeners Colin who was actually there and He gave us pretty much his short rundown of what anime Expo was to him.

218
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,740
Scott: Yeah, meanwhile comic-con just finished, you know, which is also on the west coast and we haven't talked about that really either.

219
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:36,340
Rym: So we'll talk about that after Otakon.

220
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,275
Scott: Yeah It's like if a con is on the east coast we cover it the day after.

221
00:14:40,335 --> 00:14:43,608
Scott: if a con is on the west coast It gets delayed about like a month or two.

222
00:14:43,688 --> 00:14:44,712
Scott: Then we'll talk about it.

223
00:14:45,113 --> 00:14:46,418
Scott: those west coast conventions.

224
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:46,900
Scott: They're crazy.

225
00:14:46,981 --> 00:14:55,747
Rym: Yeah, well, I'm gonna skip over some of this but I'm really just gonna focus on the anime Expo stuff because we have a lot of opinions about anime Expo and This email is mostly a.

226
00:14:55,988 --> 00:14:57,374
Scott: we've never been to anime Expo.

227
00:14:57,394 --> 00:14:58,780
Scott: So we can't really yes say them.

228
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,649
Rym: Our opinions are based mostly on hearsay.

229
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:04,165
Rym: Yep, but this is a Very this is an email.

230
00:15:04,185 --> 00:15:05,449
Rym: that's right along our opinions.

231
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:06,814
Rym: Hi Rym and Scott.

232
00:15:07,014 --> 00:15:08,660
Rym: I wanted to share my thoughts on anime Expo.

233
00:15:08,821 --> 00:15:09,589
Rym: Thanks for the heads up.

234
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:13,758
Rym: as to the size of the con I've been to many sci-fi and comic-con starting in the late 70s.

235
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,857
Rym: I must say that I concur with your comments as to the type of people who attend anime cons versus other cons.

236
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,940
Rym: I Found the anime folks to be much more open and friendly.

237
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:26,840
Rym: There are people playing ps2s and gameboys groups of people watching anime on portable DVD players.

238
00:15:27,181 --> 00:15:31,120
Rym: Others are playing card games and/or being much more outgoing than the average con goer in my genre.

239
00:15:31,623 --> 00:15:34,318
Rym: The people waiting in all the lines were very friendly and outgoing, too.

240
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:39,907
Rym: Thanks Scott for telling me about the updated Japanese version of Gigantor Blah blah blah blah blah.

241
00:15:39,927 --> 00:15:40,711
Rym: skip a bit skip a bit.

242
00:15:41,414 --> 00:15:49,280
Rym: as for the con itself It was one of the worst run major cons I have ever been to comparable to the stories you told about comic-con in New York.

243
00:15:49,942 --> 00:15:55,500
Rym: I got there 30 minutes before opening and the entire parking lot parking area around Anaheim Convention Center was already full.

244
00:15:56,184 --> 00:15:58,540
Rym: They must have had many more people show up than they expected.

245
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:04,160
Rym: They use chairs to mark the rows for ticket lines But they ran out of tape to roll off all the areas.

246
00:16:04,523 --> 00:16:06,560
Rym: There were no free goodie bags once you got your tickets.

247
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:07,724
Rym: No program either.

248
00:16:07,744 --> 00:16:10,112
Rym: the freebie table wasn't even in a huge weight.

249
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:11,678
Scott: There was no program.

250
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:13,668
Rym: apparently He says there was no program either.

251
00:16:13,688 --> 00:16:15,920
Rym: They ran out or they didn't give anyone anything.

252
00:16:16,502 --> 00:16:22,588
Scott: Okay, I mean it's one thing cuz you know people have been saying that the goodie bags have been drying up But for no program.

253
00:16:22,628 --> 00:16:23,050
Scott: whoa?

254
00:16:23,412 --> 00:16:32,320
Rym: also the fact that it's anime Expo I mean ConnectiCon had a lot of really valid reasons for the anime Expo is supposedly the anime con of this hemisphere.

255
00:16:32,707 --> 00:16:33,440
Rym: Well, it's also well.

256
00:16:33,602 --> 00:16:34,959
Rym: I would say Otakon is but yeah.

257
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,975
Scott: But well the thing is that anime expos more of a trade show and Otakon is more of a.

258
00:16:39,075 --> 00:16:41,566
Rym: but anime Expo has such Support from the industry.

259
00:16:41,646 --> 00:16:44,257
Rym: I can't believe that the industry would chaff them on that.

260
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:46,611
Rym: yeah I mean can I got had good reasons.

261
00:16:46,691 --> 00:16:47,920
Rym: anime Expo is no excuse.

262
00:16:48,101 --> 00:16:51,311
Scott: Anime Expo is sort of like the e3 and Otakon is sort of like the packs.

263
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:52,315
Rym: Yeah.

264
00:16:52,656 --> 00:16:53,298
Rym: I love packs.

265
00:16:53,398 --> 00:16:53,820
Rym: I want to go.

266
00:16:54,022 --> 00:16:55,200
Scott: Yeah, we love it.

267
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,927
Rym: We haven't been to it right to keep going on this.

268
00:16:57,369 --> 00:17:00,788
Rym: the freebie table wasn't even in the huge hall where people checked in Out or bought their tickets.

269
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:03,206
Rym: it was off in the corner somewhere And you actively had to search it out.

270
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:06,260
Rym: the ACC is multiple stories high.

271
00:17:06,621 --> 00:17:10,613
Rym: Signs for the various events only said things like second floor third floor etc.

272
00:17:10,934 --> 00:17:11,234
Scott: They didn't.

273
00:17:11,336 --> 00:17:12,680
Scott: they didn't say what room quote.

274
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,065
Rym: They didn't tell you the room number.

275
00:17:14,105 --> 00:17:15,589
Rym: you are you sure?

276
00:17:15,931 --> 00:17:18,540
Rym: you had to ask a staff member and some of them didn't know.

277
00:17:18,882 --> 00:17:20,919
Rym: There were other examples too, but you get the idea.

278
00:17:21,902 --> 00:17:24,997
Rym: He also made a whole bunch of copies of our flyer and spread them around.

279
00:17:25,037 --> 00:17:26,804
Rym: Thanks for that He.

280
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:31,620
Rym: Everything else he says is just telling us cool stuff about us or other stuff that isn't related to the con.

281
00:17:32,021 --> 00:17:36,378
Rym: He was happy that we pronounce his name correctly, which mostly is because we had a friend named Colin.

282
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:39,010
Scott: Yeah Oh, I know how to pronounce the name Colin.

283
00:17:39,272 --> 00:17:39,895
Scott: It's not howdy.

284
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:40,920
Scott: How are you gonna pronounce it?

285
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,188
Rym: He says here people pronounced it Colleen or Colin.

286
00:17:44,609 --> 00:17:58,154
Scott: Well, it could be Colin, but that's Colin Powell and and if it's Colin, it's a female and Colleen's usually Co le en Co le en.

287
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,419
Scott: that could be a good one, too.

288
00:18:01,042 --> 00:18:01,766
Scott: See, that's another thing.

289
00:18:01,786 --> 00:18:02,932
Scott: I just remembered about Otakon.

290
00:18:02,952 --> 00:18:04,239
Scott: is they had that information desk?

291
00:18:04,944 --> 00:18:07,140
Rym: Yeah, and the people there always know what's going on.

292
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:14,328
Scott: They know everything at the information desk and I've used it at least once every year for some random thing Like even if it's just oh I shit.

293
00:18:14,368 --> 00:18:17,120
Scott: I forgot what room I'll just happen to be near the information desk.

294
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,948
Scott: so I'll say hey what room is X in?

295
00:18:18,988 --> 00:18:26,638
Scott: and they'll be like room number number number number and It's a lot of conventions don't have an information desk like that, you know, right?

296
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:31,078
Rym: Yeah I mean, I'd like to go to anime Expo maybe once to confirm.

297
00:18:31,138 --> 00:18:39,180
Rym: but If any of you have been to anime Expo and had a positive experience Please let us know because I have never really heard good things about this convention at all.

298
00:18:39,594 --> 00:18:44,216
Scott: Yeah It's like the good things you hear about the convention are always in the press releases.

299
00:18:44,236 --> 00:18:50,820
Scott: or yeah You never hear good stuff like people's you know excited about anime Expo that are fans.

300
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,300
Scott: Like if you go to a fan forum, there isn't a lot of anime Expo excitement.

301
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:59,698
Rym: In fact, the best I've seen is I've seen some people who would say they had a good time at it mostly in anime Expo forums.

302
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,893
Rym: But mostly these are people who had never never been to Otakon and vice versa.

303
00:19:04,374 --> 00:19:06,260
Scott: So it's like we've never been to anime.

304
00:19:06,382 --> 00:19:07,340
Rym: So yes far away.

305
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:13,900
Rym: It's possible that we just really underestimate that con and they just really underestimate our cons, but I don't know.

306
00:19:14,683 --> 00:19:15,467
Scott: It's a tough girl.

307
00:19:15,828 --> 00:19:18,240
Rym: Yeah, but if everything he said in this email is true.

308
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:26,420
Rym: That's really kind of sad because I mean I expect even small conventions to be better than that and they almost all are.

309
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:31,154
Scott: Yeah, I mean ConnectiCon even told you what rooms and they had a program.

310
00:19:31,415 --> 00:19:35,270
Scott: Yeah, I mean a program That's not perfect is better than no program.

311
00:19:35,511 --> 00:19:37,480
Rym: Yeah, I just wondered did they run out of programs?

312
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,648
Rym: Which means they didn't come make enough?

313
00:19:39,889 --> 00:19:42,480
Rym: or did they not have one which means they're having other problems?

314
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,110
Rym: Or did they have them and screw up distributing them?

315
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,455
Rym: So people who wanted them didn't get them.

316
00:19:46,475 --> 00:19:49,805
Scott: I have no idea But it's not good.

317
00:19:50,005 --> 00:19:53,740
Rym: Yeah, so if anyone has anything positive to say about anime Expo, please let us know.

318
00:19:54,141 --> 00:19:56,669
Scott: Yeah, and maybe we'll go to it sometime.

319
00:19:56,709 --> 00:19:59,780
Rym: Yeah, maybe you can use that audio link on the website to send us some audio.

320
00:20:00,521 --> 00:20:09,417
Scott: Oh, I got an owl of the day.

321
00:20:09,818 --> 00:20:10,419
Rym: Oh, really?

322
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,617
Rym: Yeah Did you say that specifically to bait me into saying?

323
00:20:13,657 --> 00:20:13,979
Rym: Oh, really?

324
00:20:16,003 --> 00:20:17,777
Rym: Maybe I see what you did there.

325
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,051
Scott: So This is a. It seems like a Japanese TV show.

326
00:20:25,071 --> 00:20:26,438
Scott: Of course, it could be Korean.

327
00:20:26,478 --> 00:20:26,820
Scott: Who knows?

328
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:27,422
Rym: You know what?

329
00:20:27,462 --> 00:20:30,240
Rym: I generally assume that anything like that is a Japanese TV show.

330
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,754
Scott: It's got to be and there's an owl and he's sitting on a log and he's all like yeah.

331
00:20:34,774 --> 00:20:35,376
Scott: I'm an owl.

332
00:20:35,737 --> 00:20:36,740
Scott: Yeah, that's right.

333
00:20:37,043 --> 00:20:37,911
Scott: what you gonna do about it?

334
00:20:38,699 --> 00:20:47,234
Scott: and this guy comes up with a little jack-in-the-box and the jack-in-the-box goes off and Then hilarity ensues and I'll leave it at that.

335
00:20:47,495 --> 00:20:48,520
Rym: Yeah, watch this owl.

336
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:56,391
Rym: I just I love watching birds react to things because they're smart and they react in Almost human-like ways in the way they look at.

337
00:20:56,451 --> 00:20:58,640
Scott: most birds are just kind of it but owls.

338
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,524
Scott: Well, yeah something else.

339
00:20:59,704 --> 00:21:01,030
Rym: owls and parrots and smart bird.

340
00:21:01,071 --> 00:21:03,140
Rym: I mean, there are dumb birds starlings not so bright.

341
00:21:04,644 --> 00:21:05,898
Scott: It's all about the owls, baby.

342
00:21:07,281 --> 00:21:07,863
Scott: Yeah, really?

343
00:21:08,284 --> 00:21:08,846
Rym: Yeah, really?

344
00:21:09,046 --> 00:21:09,307
Rym: Okay.

345
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:21,108
Rym: All right now I this is something I found kind of randomly because I was actually looking for video of my old marching band because a couple of people had asked me about it and Actually all my friends in the van.

346
00:21:21,128 --> 00:21:23,760
Rym: I've been asked him around and no one has the videos anymore.

347
00:21:24,163 --> 00:21:25,958
Rym: So I'm trying to hunt down like some videos.

348
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:41,538
Rym: But anyway, and I found this kind of randomly and it's basically a guy who plays a trumpet duet but it's just one guy and He does the old trick of hold two trumpets one in each hand on two parts of your lips and play a song on both Trumpets playing different notes on both of them.

349
00:21:42,681 --> 00:21:46,694
Rym: It's not that difficult to do but it's really difficult to do so.

350
00:21:46,734 --> 00:21:51,049
Rym: it sounds like anything other than crap And it's just really cool.

351
00:21:51,069 --> 00:21:51,432
Rym: Check it out.

352
00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:55,174
Scott: Oh You know, it's like those guys who play two guitars.

353
00:21:55,194 --> 00:21:56,280
Rym: Yeah, I like stuff like that.

354
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,699
Rym: I really like watching people do cool things with instruments.

355
00:22:00,104 --> 00:22:06,619
Scott: you know, it really always bothers me like You know, how long has it been since someone's invented a new instrument, you know?

356
00:22:07,141 --> 00:22:14,619
Rym: Well, keep in mind that the vast majority of instruments that have been invented over the years have been ignored for good reason That that is absolutely true.

357
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:22,560
Scott: But you know, you can't tell me or convince me that there isn't a useful instrument that hasn't yet been created.

358
00:22:23,222 --> 00:22:29,506
Rym: Yeah, well there I mean over the years have been a lot of things like trombones and trumpets and French horns have evolved considerably and Gotten better and better and better.

359
00:22:29,907 --> 00:22:42,234
Rym: Of course new instruments has appeared like the sousaphone Was a new instrument that Basically how new a Long time ago centuries John Philip Sousa days.

360
00:22:42,515 --> 00:22:44,160
Rym: Yeah, hence sousaphone.

361
00:22:44,481 --> 00:22:47,370
Scott: Yeah, so so it's not a new instrument.

362
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:48,232
Rym: It's new.

363
00:22:48,313 --> 00:22:49,597
Scott: I think the newest instrument.

364
00:22:49,637 --> 00:22:54,900
Scott: That's Theremin is the theremin or perhaps the electronic keyboard the synthesizer.

365
00:22:55,841 --> 00:23:08,159
Scott: See, oh, you know, there's new synthesizers every day true Maybe that's why there's no new Instruments because people just make a new synthesizer to sound make a new sound if they come up with one and That we don't need an actual instrument for it anymore.

366
00:23:09,161 --> 00:23:11,472
Rym: Yeah, I mean there's already a million kinds of trumpets.

367
00:23:11,512 --> 00:23:13,340
Rym: I can't think of a different kind of trumpet.

368
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:20,125
Scott: I would want to know a different mechanism like not a woodwind instrument not a brass instrument a new kind of instrument that works on A different principle.

369
00:23:20,205 --> 00:23:27,006
Rym: All right, so other than something vibrating at the end of a tube Yeah, okay How about hitting something?

370
00:23:27,046 --> 00:23:27,850
Rym: we got that covered?

371
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:33,051
Scott: We've got the hitting we've got the string plucking We've got the the blowing into something.

372
00:23:33,312 --> 00:23:35,379
Scott: We need a. we need a fourth way to make music.

373
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:38,669
Rym: Hmm, maybe we should read the fourth way.

374
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,635
Scott: No because I'm gonna do with music.

375
00:23:40,796 --> 00:23:41,739
Rym: Yeah, but the moon might know.

376
00:23:42,647 --> 00:23:44,922
Scott: No, it's just gonna eat your soul Alright.

377
00:23:44,963 --> 00:23:46,329
Rym: now to the geek back.

378
00:23:46,349 --> 00:23:48,780
Rym: We got a while ago complaining about inside jokes.

379
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:51,427
Rym: That was a fucking inside joke right there.

380
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:52,269
Rym: Holy shit.

381
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:53,191
Scott: Was that inside?

382
00:23:53,292 --> 00:23:55,738
Rym: Yeah, so, uh, I'll leave it at that.

383
00:23:55,758 --> 00:23:58,885
Rym: today We're going to talk about Slayers.

384
00:23:59,327 --> 00:24:00,291
Rym: it kind of in general.

385
00:24:00,311 --> 00:24:10,980
Scott: we're not Slayer as in the band Not Slayer as in I'm going to slay you or don't forget people who ride sleighs.

386
00:24:13,122 --> 00:24:16,458
Rym: Yeah, you know arrow of slaying versus arrow of slaying right.

387
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:22,455
Scott: so The Slayers that we're talking about are these slayers as in the anime mostly.

388
00:24:22,475 --> 00:24:24,560
Scott: the anime mostly but also the manga.

389
00:24:24,901 --> 00:24:30,339
Rym: We're not reviewing it so much because I've only seen the first layers and most of slayers.

390
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:36,479
Rym: next God has only seen the first layers and a bunch of the OAVs and neither of us have read the manga at all.

391
00:24:37,262 --> 00:24:38,989
Rym: I bought a bunch of it, but I haven't even looked at it yet.

392
00:24:39,089 --> 00:24:41,660
Scott: I haven't read a single slayers manga.

393
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:46,155
Scott: now Let's let's first talk about What slayers things exist.

394
00:24:46,296 --> 00:24:46,720
Scott: there are?

395
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,540
Scott: two mangas, yep, there are.

396
00:24:50,632 --> 00:24:52,416
Scott: There is a prequel movie.

397
00:24:52,816 --> 00:24:54,380
Scott: there is another as a prequel OAV.

398
00:24:55,224 --> 00:24:58,140
Scott: There are one two three four sequel movies.

399
00:24:58,802 --> 00:25:11,039
Scott: There's the original slayers TV show 26 episodes is slayers next which is the second TV show also 26 and there is a third slayers TV show slayers try which is 24 episodes and then some crap.

400
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:13,612
Scott: Yep, yep.

401
00:25:13,653 --> 00:25:13,814
Scott: Yep.

402
00:25:13,834 --> 00:25:13,996
Scott: Yep.

403
00:25:14,922 --> 00:25:19,738
Scott: So slayers is about mostly this one girl Lena inverse.

404
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,400
Rym: now She is a magic user.

405
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:28,271
Rym: She is a high-level magic user in a world that is basically Dungeons & Dragons Made real this.

406
00:25:28,331 --> 00:25:29,740
Scott: this is exactly Dungeons & Dragons.

407
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:34,254
Scott: I mean imagine who made slayers were D&D players and this was like one of their campaigns.

408
00:25:34,274 --> 00:25:36,200
Rym: like imagine a world where you're the world.

409
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:43,932
Rym: it's just like D&D and people can just cast fireball and High level people just kick the living hell out of anyone who's lower level.

410
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,460
Rym: Yeah, there's big baddies and you fight them.

411
00:25:46,942 --> 00:25:49,820
Scott: Now there are two types of slayers shows and manga.

412
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:56,059
Scott: They're the Lena inverse with Naga the serpent and there is Lena inverse with everyone else.

413
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,591
Rym: now I greatly prefer the latter of the two.

414
00:25:58,953 --> 00:26:00,380
Scott: I greatly prefer the former.

415
00:26:01,103 --> 00:26:03,473
Rym: Yeah, see they're both good shows and they're both good.

416
00:26:03,493 --> 00:26:05,140
Rym: They're just there's a very different feeling.

417
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:11,571
Rym: I mean the theoretically slayers with Naga Occurs way before she meets up with all these other people.

418
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:19,720
Scott: Yes slayers with Naga is what you're gonna see in All the prequel movies and and like the OAVs most all that stuff.

419
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,433
Scott: Yep, the actual TV shows you're not gonna see Naga the serpent.

420
00:26:23,714 --> 00:26:25,400
Rym: She's not there which is fine by me.

421
00:26:25,641 --> 00:26:28,633
Scott: Okay, so Naga the serpent let's talk about her first cuz it's simple to explain.

422
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:30,320
Scott: All right now get the surface.

423
00:26:32,602 --> 00:26:33,551
Scott: That's Naga the serpent.

424
00:26:33,611 --> 00:26:40,460
Scott: she is Incredibly tall has gigantic boobs and black hair and she's a powerful sorceress.

425
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:46,822
Scott: Yeah And see here's there's Lena inverse is short has small boobs and is an even more powerful Sorcer seems.

426
00:26:46,882 --> 00:26:54,766
Rym: the general differences between the Naga slayers and the everyone else layers is that the former tends to rely mostly on Boob jokes.

427
00:26:55,169 --> 00:26:56,579
Rym: My boobs are small OMG.

428
00:26:59,486 --> 00:27:01,480
Rym: And then they blow stuff up and make puns.

429
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:04,156
Rym: Yep, the latter is more.

430
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:06,099
Rym: We're hungry.

431
00:27:06,802 --> 00:27:07,806
Rym: Chaos ensues.

432
00:27:08,187 --> 00:27:10,013
Scott: we go to an inn we eat.

433
00:27:10,134 --> 00:27:11,960
Scott: the inn is blown up by a dragon.

434
00:27:12,121 --> 00:27:13,570
Scott: We go to another in to eat.

435
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,080
Scott: It is blown up by a dragon.

436
00:27:15,784 --> 00:27:18,318
Scott: They cannot eat at an inn without it being blown up.

437
00:27:19,523 --> 00:27:23,859
Rym: Yeah, yeah, if you haven't figured it out, these shows are nothing but comedy.

438
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:31,640
Scott: Slayers is perhaps the perennial Fantasy D&D adventuring comedy series of all anime and manga.

439
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:39,849
Rym: I mean lotus war is looked to by many as the earliest really good fantasy Like high production value anime of the modern era.

440
00:27:39,969 --> 00:27:42,658
Scott: Yes slayers is hilarious lotus war.

441
00:27:42,739 --> 00:27:44,023
Rym: Yes It's fine.

442
00:27:44,124 --> 00:27:47,517
Rym: I find it funnier than lotus island and I really like lotus island.

443
00:27:47,858 --> 00:27:49,985
Scott: Oh, man Slayers just you know.

444
00:27:50,266 --> 00:27:52,052
Scott: lotus island is made to be cute.

445
00:27:52,373 --> 00:27:54,600
Scott: lotus war but slayers the whole thing.

446
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,490
Scott: He's just meant to be as funny as possible.

447
00:27:56,711 --> 00:27:58,500
Scott: Even at the incredibly serious parts.

448
00:27:58,669 --> 00:27:58,839
Rym: Yes

449
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,706
Scott: they make jokes that are just stupid like

450
00:28:00,766 --> 00:28:10,094
Rym: it gets to the point where the show like starts getting serious and then something stupid happens and They break the fourth wall all the time and they'll turn to you and be like, yeah There's no way they let the show get that serious.

451
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:18,036
Scott: Haha Yeah, it'll be like they'll fighting the the super serious bad guy and this is a super serious awesome fight.

452
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:22,231
Scott: music and you know They're gonna save the world or a bunch of people are gonna die.

453
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:24,420
Scott: and then some guy would be like, yeah, whatever.

454
00:28:25,441 --> 00:28:29,134
Rym: Now the best part about slayers that they kind of mean every.

455
00:28:29,154 --> 00:28:39,179
Rym: a lot of things in slayers are very cliche but a lot of the cliches and slayers were not so cliched when they were done and they've become cliches more so since.

456
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:56,312
Rym: and also there's one moment in the original season of slayers that to me just defines part of the awesome of the show where There's the big bad guy and he's about to do his big bad thing and the hero show up to stop him and he's like You cannot stop me and he sends a monster for them to fight.

457
00:28:56,352 --> 00:29:08,299
Rym: now in any typical fantasy Whatever the bad guy would stand there watching While the you know, the good guys fought his giant monster and then when they beat the giant monster There'd be some sort of epic final conflict.

458
00:29:09,343 --> 00:29:16,836
Rym: The bad guy as soon as he sticks the monster Immediately runs away locks the door does his evil ritual and completes it as fast as he can.

459
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:19,912
Rym: Yep The show is just awesome.

460
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:21,120
Scott: It's very awesome.

461
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,849
Scott: There are a lot of other things that make it awesome.

462
00:29:23,391 --> 00:29:30,120
Scott: like Rym is talking about some of the cliches You know how many animes have you seen where the cat the main care group of characters is always hungry and they you know?

463
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:35,100
Scott: Once in a while they get money and food like samurai Champloo and kawaii boppin.

464
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:40,526
Scott: Yeah, all those slayers I think is the first show to have that I'm sure anime world order is gonna send us.

465
00:29:41,108 --> 00:29:42,331
Rym: Oh you forgot about Poland.

466
00:29:42,351 --> 00:29:44,999
Scott: Oh, we sure did damn Poland.

467
00:29:46,756 --> 00:29:53,180
Rym: Uh Yeah, I mean once again, we're not reviewing slayers because I think we're gonna review each season and each bit of slayers independent.

468
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,888
Scott: Yeah this is an introduction to the world of slayers.

469
00:29:55,968 --> 00:30:07,279
Scott: for those of you who don't know of it cuz slayers is a really old show that was super popular and they licensed the hell out of it and they distributed all over the US and then After they sold it to everyone.

470
00:30:07,782 --> 00:30:14,324
Scott: It's been kind of forgotten in favor of newer shows and I think even some of the licenses lapsed and were Re-picked up and

471
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:26,440
Rym: I mean it used to be back in the day when you went to a Suncoast or somewhere that actually sold Anime, they would have VHS's of Ranma and then a VHS's of slayers like those two were always there everywhere.

472
00:30:27,781 --> 00:30:32,540
Scott: And nowadays a lot of new fans don't even know slayers or they know of it, but they've never seen it.

473
00:30:32,972 --> 00:30:48,719
Rym: Yeah and honestly I I have to admit that I hadn't seen that much of the first season of slayers and it wasn't until Scott and I actually Watched it all the way through That it was actually weird to see the characters before they met each other because I'd seen so much of slayers where they're all already together.

474
00:30:49,505 --> 00:30:50,309
Scott: Yeah, it was deaf.

475
00:30:50,893 --> 00:30:51,980
Scott: It's always weird to watch.

476
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,385
Scott: You know what happened before.

477
00:30:53,405 --> 00:30:59,900
Scott: if you if you already know what happened after Star Wars Oh God Yeah, let's talk about this one.

478
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,615
Scott: If you're gonna watch any slayers the movie the movie is what you have to write now.

479
00:31:03,715 --> 00:31:13,180
Rym: when we say the slayers movie We mean the one that you'll see in the anime store on DVD the one that is right there everywhere It is everyone knows it as the slayers movie.

480
00:31:13,441 --> 00:31:17,874
Scott: It says on the DVD case slayers the motion picture now.

481
00:31:18,255 --> 00:31:23,929
Rym: It is a Lina and Naga and This is where many of our inside jokes come from.

482
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:24,692
Rym: surprisingly.

483
00:31:24,712 --> 00:31:28,145
Scott: There is the main joke in this the bit.

484
00:31:28,165 --> 00:31:38,447
Scott: the plot of the movie is that this is island Mipros Island and Lena inverse is on this island and there's something bad going on there and She has to figure it out and stop it.

485
00:31:38,487 --> 00:31:40,235
Scott: and she's a super powerful sorceress.

486
00:31:40,255 --> 00:31:41,119
Scott: So that's not a problem.

487
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,953
Scott: Yeah It's mostly the figuring it out.

488
00:31:43,014 --> 00:31:46,294
Rym: That's the problem Yeah, plus she doesn't really care until they bribe her with a lot of money.

489
00:31:46,495 --> 00:31:47,460
Scott: exactly, you know.

490
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:55,667
Rym: But keep in mind that this movie is a lot different from the slayers TV shows and that it's very surreal and weird Very at least at some parts of it.

491
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:59,020
Rym: Yeah, but overall I mean compared to the TV show which is very straightforward.

492
00:32:00,161 --> 00:32:08,629
Scott: So early on in the movie some guy shows up and he's like he's fighting he's gonna fight with Lena and he says I'm the Fifth strongest man on Mipros Island now ha ha ha ha ha.

493
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:12,300
Rym: I highly recommend you watch the dub because it's pretty well done.

494
00:32:12,883 --> 00:32:15,980
Rym: And I got to admit hearing someone yell in English, huh?

495
00:32:16,263 --> 00:32:17,860
Rym: I am the fifth strongest man on Mipros Island.

496
00:32:18,643 --> 00:32:19,728
Rym: Just I can't.

497
00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:21,214
Rym: I can't help but laugh at that.

498
00:32:21,335 --> 00:32:27,600
Scott: and then a little while later She runs into the fourth strongest man on Mipros Island and well, you can see where it goes from there.

499
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:34,540
Scott: But when we talk about being the ex strongest something in something we're making fun of the first slayers.

500
00:32:34,681 --> 00:32:36,128
Scott: Well the slayers movie.

501
00:32:36,268 --> 00:32:36,510
Rym: Yes.

502
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:42,033
Rym: Now if you've never seen any slayers If nothing else pick up this movie because it is very funny.

503
00:32:42,053 --> 00:32:48,640
Rym: It'll introduce you to the world It'll introduce you to all the kinds of jokes and you don't have to invest in an entire TV show.

504
00:32:48,769 --> 00:32:50,626
Scott: Yeah This is a completely self-contained movie.

505
00:32:50,666 --> 00:32:55,001
Scott: someone who knows jack and shit about slayers will laugh their ass off at this thing if you like It.

506
00:32:55,161 --> 00:33:03,618
Rym: either Netflix or buy the first season of slayers because it's really easy to come by nowadays Mm-hmm, and it should be even easier to come by as time goes on.

507
00:33:04,001 --> 00:33:08,067
Scott: Yeah, no one's printing more of it But no one's buying it and the price is just gonna drop.

508
00:33:08,448 --> 00:33:12,822
Rym: now the TV show as opposed to the movies and OAVs and such the.

509
00:33:13,003 --> 00:33:16,699
Rym: I mean it gets very serious at times, but it always fades back to funny.

510
00:33:16,719 --> 00:33:22,518
Rym: and Then slayers next which is the sequel to slayers and it takes place pretty much right after.

511
00:33:22,538 --> 00:33:23,100
Rym: it just keeps going.

512
00:33:24,244 --> 00:33:25,399
Rym: It kind of widens the gap.

513
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,286
Rym: There's more serious but even more funny.

514
00:33:27,306 --> 00:33:39,835
Rym: and then slayers try which I actually didn't like so much and I didn't even see all of it Takes it to the extreme and it has the crazy Stupid funny and the crazy serious and it the dichotomy almost gets too big.

515
00:33:39,895 --> 00:33:41,560
Rym: but luckily the show didn't progress beyond that.

516
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:47,500
Scott: Yeah, another warning for anyone who's gonna watch slayers is that there's a lot of running gags and repetitive humor.

517
00:33:47,681 --> 00:33:53,760
Scott: You'll see the same you'll see a joke and then they'll keep going with that same joke and never change it ever.

518
00:33:54,061 --> 00:33:55,688
Rym: Though the thing is it's usually still funny.

519
00:33:55,708 --> 00:33:58,720
Scott: to me it is it's still a little bit funny every time.

520
00:33:59,001 --> 00:34:04,913
Scott: but if you're the kind of person who groans and moans when they've you know, Some character has a shtick like.

521
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:05,980
Scott: what's a good example?

522
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,190
Rym: Amelia falls on her face when she tries to jump into the heat of battle.

523
00:34:09,451 --> 00:34:17,460
Scott: exactly Amelia whenever she's about to enter a fight She climbs up somewhere very high and then she jumps into the fight and then she lands on her face every single goddamn time.

524
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,726
Scott: So it's funny as hell.

525
00:34:19,746 --> 00:34:21,734
Scott: the first three times is you realize?

526
00:34:21,873 --> 00:34:23,420
Scott: aha she falls in her face all the time.

527
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,819
Scott: But then in in future episodes, she just keeps falling on her face.

528
00:34:27,442 --> 00:34:32,260
Rym: Now the thing is that type of humor seems to be a mainstay of a lot of the early anime comedies.

529
00:34:32,641 --> 00:34:40,235
Rym: So if you can't deal with it in slayers You really shouldn't watch any of the early anime comedy shows because they're all like that.

530
00:34:40,697 --> 00:34:44,049
Scott: Yeah So many jokes like that in slayers.

531
00:34:44,109 --> 00:34:48,364
Scott: I mean every time they're eating food in and in it explodes Or sets on fire.

532
00:34:48,806 --> 00:34:51,359
Rym: Who knows what the hell things get blown up all the time.

533
00:34:52,022 --> 00:34:53,568
Rym: Yeah, and there's also a lot.

534
00:34:53,608 --> 00:35:01,993
Rym: if you play Dungeons & Dragons or any kind of fantasy role-playing You will appreciate these shows on such a higher level than if you don't.

535
00:35:02,815 --> 00:35:04,680
Rym: I mean Lena needs money at one point.

536
00:35:04,901 --> 00:35:07,940
Rym: So she sits there like basically making magic items to sell in town.

537
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:21,052
Scott: Yeah They actually animate that whole scene where like she gets some equipment and she goes out to like some shrine and she starts casting Metamorphosis spells to turn some dreck into some gems and then she sells them at a store in town.

538
00:35:21,233 --> 00:35:24,708
Rym: or she gets some magic items and they start selling them You know like to take magic.

539
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:26,860
Rym: Ooh, this one's worth this much and tries to sell it to people.

540
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,700
Scott: It's yeah, isn't there some episode later on where they go somewhere where there's no magic and they're ridiculously powerful.

541
00:35:33,141 --> 00:35:34,925
Rym: Yes in slayers try see it.

542
00:35:35,146 --> 00:35:36,590
Rym: They're ridiculously powerful.

543
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:40,740
Scott: Anyway, these are slayers is a story about high-level characters.

544
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:46,500
Scott: They're stupid powerful like saving the world from the most powerful demon god powerful.

545
00:35:46,741 --> 00:35:47,363
Rym: Yeah, they are.

546
00:35:47,484 --> 00:35:51,740
Rym: I mean D&D terms their 9th to 12th level even more than that.

547
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,451
Rym: Well Lena probably more but everyone else seems to be there.

548
00:35:54,471 --> 00:35:55,154
Rym: They're high level.

549
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,580
Rym: They're definitely not epic level yet.

550
00:35:56,921 --> 00:36:02,220
Scott: No, they're not gods, but they can stave off gods through the use of incredibly powerful artifacts.

551
00:36:02,387 --> 00:36:08,232
Rym: Yes kill a couple of gods even yeah, but it Actually slayers try had something really good going for it.

552
00:36:08,252 --> 00:36:14,294
Rym: that part of the plot there is that They end up in a world where there is no magic like people don't like.

553
00:36:14,374 --> 00:36:23,720
Rym: magic is this crazy rare thing and I don't really want to ruin much but there's not much to ruin in slayers really and They still have all their powers because they know how to cast spells.

554
00:36:24,142 --> 00:36:38,547
Rym: So like there's a part where one of the characters at like goat like has one of the townspeople lead him to like this ancient ruin of the ancient masters like this Secret Forbidden Palace that has been sealed by something and hasn't been open for thousands of years And he's like is this a place?

555
00:36:38,567 --> 00:36:40,797
Rym: the guys like yes, and he just kicks the gate open walks in.

556
00:36:40,817 --> 00:36:43,557
Rym: he's like oh All right, he grabs some artifacts like this is pretty weak.

557
00:36:44,562 --> 00:36:50,874
Rym: Another character flies up on the top of building to look around and all the townsfolk think that she's gonna jump to her death And just funny stuff like that.

558
00:36:53,382 --> 00:36:53,643
Rym: Of course.

559
00:36:53,703 --> 00:37:01,644
Rym: layers next has probably my favorite joke in all of slayers the the whole thing with trying to find the Claire Bible the Claire bevel the Claire bevel I don't even know.

560
00:37:01,664 --> 00:37:03,232
Rym: I've never actually seen the sub of slayer.

561
00:37:03,272 --> 00:37:04,699
Scott: One of my favorite jokes is the fish men.

562
00:37:06,283 --> 00:37:07,049
Scott: There there are these.

563
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,340
Scott: this is race of creatures.

564
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:19,240
Scott: There are a lot of different races of creatures as in any Fantasy universe and one of the races of creatures in slayers are the fish men and they're basically fish with cartoon arms and legs.

565
00:37:19,902 --> 00:37:23,937
Rym: They're ugly as hell and you get the sense that they smell bad and they're all evil.

566
00:37:23,957 --> 00:37:27,691
Rym: yet They're all silly also kind of stupid.

567
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:33,034
Scott: Yeah, they're stupid evil and silly And they show up when you at least expect them.

568
00:37:33,074 --> 00:37:34,240
Rym: It's like like altros.

569
00:37:34,481 --> 00:37:36,851
Scott: Yeah, it's like you're walking around and there's a fish man.

570
00:37:36,911 --> 00:37:37,514
Scott: What the hell?

571
00:37:37,534 --> 00:37:41,270
Rym: Oh my god Remember the fish man that was flying around like a bullet.

572
00:37:41,652 --> 00:37:42,737
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

573
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:43,520
Scott: What was his problem?

574
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,653
Rym: I think the funniest part of that was you said why don't they just do this?

575
00:37:46,754 --> 00:37:49,718
Rym: and then they just did that and it killed the fish man immediately.

576
00:37:51,841 --> 00:37:53,047
Rym: That's one nice thing about the show.

577
00:37:53,107 --> 00:37:58,940
Rym: the characters always seem to act intelligently Like they were being played by real people in a D&D game.

578
00:37:59,441 --> 00:38:02,930
Scott: Yeah, but sometimes they also act stupidly, you know, like.

579
00:38:03,271 --> 00:38:10,760
Scott: well stupid characters do like they get lost and then they can't find each other Again, you know it they'll get into trouble and then they won't be able to get out.

580
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,459
Scott: But as long as they stick together, they can just keep acting smartly and do the right thing.

581
00:38:16,501 --> 00:38:24,059
Scott: There are other sort of annoying things like I think for a stretch of episodes in the original slayers It just every episode seemed like it was the same thing.

582
00:38:24,423 --> 00:38:32,896
Scott: They would be in a different place But they would fight the same bad guys and then those bad guys would run away and the next episode they'd be in a different Place and then to fight those same bad guys again.

583
00:38:32,916 --> 00:38:36,398
Rym: Yeah Well, the thing is I really enjoy like I just like it.

584
00:38:36,418 --> 00:38:40,920
Rym: slayers The original series has a really good nice place in my heart and I really enjoy it.

585
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:44,720
Rym: It's one of my favorite old shows, but I enjoyed slayers next a lot more.

586
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,420
Rym: So I think Scott when you see slayers next you your love of slayers will come to a whole new level.

587
00:38:50,171 --> 00:38:50,456
Scott: I don't know.

588
00:38:51,042 --> 00:38:58,489
Scott: I'm still more a fan of the naga the serpent because that stuff is just all-out Hilarity and doesn't doesn't even bother with the serious.

589
00:38:58,509 --> 00:38:59,933
Scott: then hilarity then serious.

590
00:38:59,993 --> 00:39:05,179
Rym: It's just all funny jellyfish in the sea cucumbers Exactly or the giant golems.

591
00:39:07,081 --> 00:39:10,220
Rym: Okay, yeah if you want to see really silly stuff get all the slayers.

592
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:19,920
Rym: Yeah, yeah, yeah God yeah slayers must be good because we just keep laughing as we remember scenes from it.

593
00:39:21,602 --> 00:39:28,107
Scott: yeah, so anyone out there who doesn't know of slayers or Maybe you know of it and you've never seen it.

594
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:31,760
Scott: It is an anime that all should see an experience.

595
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:33,529
Rym: I mean, it's definitely not.

596
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:36,137
Rym: I don't think in my top 5 or top 10 No, no, no.

597
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,049
Rym: But it is definitely on the list of.

598
00:39:38,391 --> 00:39:44,320
Rym: if you consider yourself an anime fan But not like as in you would define yourself as a fan or anime is your thing.

599
00:39:44,902 --> 00:39:46,949
Rym: You really have no excuse to have not seen slayers.

600
00:39:46,969 --> 00:39:47,090
Rym: you.

601
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:47,652
Rym: that is like.

602
00:39:47,732 --> 00:40:00,411
Rym: I must see anime because so much comes from slayers that is in modern anime and it was such a good show when it came out and the fact that It's still a pretty good show all things considered even today.

603
00:40:00,471 --> 00:40:03,180
Rym: It would even stand up to a lot of modern shows.

604
00:40:04,041 --> 00:40:12,580
Scott: And the thing is even though some slayers OAVs and movies are better than others They're all at least at the bare minimum funny.

605
00:40:12,781 --> 00:40:17,159
Scott: You will laugh it no matter which one you watch and if you don't laugh, you're not gonna laugh any of them.

606
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,900
Rym: Yeah, and if you don't laugh at them, there's a lot of anime you're not gonna like.

607
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,660
Scott: There are also some slayers video games.

608
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:26,040
Scott: I know there's an SNES game, but they're all Japanese and I don't think they've been translated.

609
00:40:26,261 --> 00:40:29,310
Rym: Yes, any s game has been but not officially there have been.

610
00:40:29,331 --> 00:40:30,434
Scott: it's not a fun game.

611
00:40:30,534 --> 00:40:32,361
Rym: Anyway, well, it's like Final Fantasy 6.

612
00:40:32,361 --> 00:40:38,474
Rym: It's a lot like Final Fantasy 6 in fact And I played through a little bit of it and then the translated ROM I was using.

613
00:40:38,534 --> 00:40:43,879
Rym: it turns out that whatever fucker Translated it translated the first bit and then just stopped.

614
00:40:44,701 --> 00:40:51,506
Rym: So fine one day I get to a village like I get somewhere and I talk to someone and it's just gibberish and not even Japanese characters are just gibberish.

615
00:40:51,967 --> 00:40:56,781
Rym: Yeah, and then everyone I talked to was gibberish and I couldn't forget through the game anymore Uh-huh.

616
00:40:57,484 --> 00:41:00,074
Scott: Yeah, I wouldn't really recommend it as a game.

617
00:41:00,094 --> 00:41:09,739
Rym: You should play unless you're Japanese though I can't verify this cuz I didn't play through the game and I'm not gonna look it up or anything, but I heard There's some slayers trivia for you that you know.

618
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:16,577
Rym: Naga and Lena adventure and then later Naga and Gauri and everyone else adventure and there's really no overlap at all.

619
00:41:16,597 --> 00:41:26,475
Rym: Like there's no Continuity directly between the two and Apparently in the video game Gauri and Naga meet one another.

620
00:41:26,495 --> 00:41:27,659
Scott: Oh my god.

621
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,720
Rym: now That is nothing but hearsay.

622
00:41:31,384 --> 00:41:38,380
Rym: I will not back that statement up at all But more than one person has told me this and I've never bothered to look it up.

623
00:41:39,781 --> 00:41:41,988
Scott: Yeah, like I said before, you know some slayers.

624
00:41:42,028 --> 00:41:52,960
Scott: things are Lena inverse and Naga the serpent and no one else except for the bad Guys, of course and the rest of slayers is Lena inverse and an entire party of adventurers, but not Naga the serpent.

625
00:41:53,683 --> 00:42:03,999
Rym: Yeah, I'd go through all the characters because I could say a lot about him, but even describing it now He's a fighter there's well, it's saying the names of certain characters ruins things that oh that guy's not a villain.

626
00:42:04,642 --> 00:42:05,084
Scott: It's true.

627
00:42:05,164 --> 00:42:15,020
Rym: cuz I'm assuming that people who are gonna go out and watch the show because of us They haven't seen it and they won't know that that one guy is actually a really cool main character or that that other guy dies.

628
00:42:15,624 --> 00:42:22,160
Scott: Yeah, it's it's generally there's a fighter There's a guy who's a magician, but he's a different kind of magician like a druid type.

629
00:42:22,268 --> 00:42:29,946
Rym: Yeah They there's a lot of clarity in the magic like there's a rogue type of person kind is Dungeons & Dragons style magic.

630
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:33,860
Rym: you say the spell it happens and the fireball.

631
00:42:35,001 --> 00:42:44,326
Rym: The spells follow the same kinds of rules that D&D spells would and in fact the characters explain this stuff all the time Like they explain it to each other.

632
00:42:44,346 --> 00:42:47,720
Rym: they'll explain what spells do just this for the benefit of the Watchers.

633
00:42:48,402 --> 00:42:51,595
Scott: They'll lose their spell powers during that time of the month.

634
00:42:51,836 --> 00:42:59,016
Rym: Yes, which It's a really freakin good show, I don't know how many times I need to say that.

635
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:00,908
Scott: all right I think that covers it.

636
00:43:01,331 --> 00:43:12,446
Rym: Yeah under the few meta bits Don't forget that next week is the last week before we go to Otakon and the week after that We can't promise that there will be Episodes.

637
00:43:12,748 --> 00:43:25,439
Rym: Yes, most likely the week after Otakon they're going to be some short like five to ten minute GeekNights specials that we're going to record ahead of time and Set up to automatically upload because we're not going to be able to do the shows from the beach.

638
00:43:26,461 --> 00:43:31,720
Scott: Well, I mean we probably could but it'd be too much effort going to McDonald's and using the Wi-Fi and plus.

639
00:43:31,861 --> 00:43:45,534
Rym: I got to tell you once we get back the week after that We are going to have almost a month worth of content from all the interviews and the coverage of Otakon and the coverage of Wildwood and all the crazy things we're going to do.

640
00:43:45,594 --> 00:43:46,940
Rym: We're bringing all this equipment.

641
00:43:47,301 --> 00:43:52,054
Rym: We're gonna record almost everything we do throughout this entire two weeks of awesome.

642
00:43:52,315 --> 00:43:54,080
Scott: It's gonna be pretty freakin crazy.

Scott: So don't be disappointed about.
