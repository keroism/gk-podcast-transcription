Rym: This is yet another GeekNights special.

5
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:25,509
Rym: We are out of town as part of Otakon and the week of fun that follows it every year.

6
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:35,604
Scott: Yeah By the time you're listening to this Otakon will be over and we will be far away on a beach or something And we won't be able to record anything.

7
00:00:35,704 --> 00:00:41,707
Rym: So yeah, yes Hence we thought we'd do these short specials to one fill out the feed while we're gone and two.

8
00:00:41,827 --> 00:00:43,092
Rym: so you guys don't forget We exist.

00:00:43,955 --> 00:00:46,062
Scott: if this is the first time you're listening to GeekNights.

10
00:00:46,102 --> 00:00:47,668
Scott: This is not normal GeekNights.

11
00:00:47,768 --> 00:00:48,330

Rym: Hence is a GeekNights special.

14
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:57,145
Rym: if you want to know what the show is all about I suggest you look for any episode that doesn't have the word special in the title.

15
00:00:57,326 --> 00:00:58,350
Scott: That would be a good idea.

16
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,220
Rym: There are about a hundred and sixty of them.

17
00:01:00,924 --> 00:01:01,789
Scott: Who knows how many?

18
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:07,266
Scott: I Think we should just stop using episode numbers and use the numbers that we use on the.

19
00:01:07,587 --> 00:01:13,386
Scott: we don't use episode numbers Anyway, I know but like stop counting the episodes just actually say episode.

20
00:01:13,466 --> 00:01:13,868
Scott: Oh six.

21
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:16,319
Rym: Oh, whatever We just say what day the episode is.

22
00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:18,630
Rym: Anyway, we've never said what the episode number was ever.

23
00:01:18,891 --> 00:01:19,734
Scott: I think we did like.

24
00:01:20,235 --> 00:01:20,657
Rym: no we didn't.

25
00:01:20,677 --> 00:01:26,574
Scott: we've never introduced the show that way not introduced the show that way but talking about it That way at all Okay.

26
00:01:26,937 --> 00:01:29,690
Rym: Yeah, the only one who's ever done that is you maybe.

27
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:38,686
Rym: Anyway, since it's anime day our special will involve a story from the days when we used to run the RIT anime club.

28
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:40,490
Scott: scary days.

29
00:01:40,932 --> 00:01:52,475
Rym: well, they were good days, but one time we were at this convention and Some people from case Western who they also also have a fairly large anime club, you know We met him and they're talking to our club people.

30
00:01:53,077 --> 00:01:55,324
Rym: and after a while they realized wait a minute.

31
00:01:55,645 --> 00:01:57,070
Rym: You're the RIT anime people.

32
00:01:57,876 --> 00:01:59,147
Rym: We have a warning for you.

33
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:04,126
Rym: And they were dead serious like the tone because cease to become jovial.

34
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,070
Rym: and they were dead serious.

35
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,985
Rym: They said we've got this guy and his name is Steve.

36
00:02:09,187 --> 00:02:12,073
Scott: and we said whoa We have Steve's.

37
00:02:12,414 --> 00:02:13,839
Scott: yeah know all about Steve's.

38
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,150
Rym: we know everything there is to know about guys named Steve and anime clubs.

39
00:02:17,432 --> 00:02:24,830
Rym: In fact, we had two of them and they said no this guy And they couldn't really even describe him.

40
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:30,634
Rym: They just said he's going to RIT next year and we said, oh great We'll have three Steve.

41
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:36,595
Rym: and then they said we felt the need to warn you about this guy And we totally blew these guys off.

42
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:41,090
Scott: Yeah, we're like, okay if you know if this isn't just complete BS either.

43
00:02:41,231 --> 00:02:47,876
Scott: Okay, we have two Steve's already a third Steve isn't you know, whatever we if we can handle the two We got we can handle a third one.

44
00:02:48,157 --> 00:02:53,621
Rym: now to back up a bit the whole thing about Steve's there were we know a bunch Of people named Steve and one of which is good.

45
00:02:53,802 --> 00:02:55,250
Rym: Yeah, one of which is a very good friend of ours.

46
00:02:55,671 --> 00:02:57,817
Rym: There are a couple other Steve's we know who are general.

47
00:02:57,898 --> 00:02:58,499
Rym: Okay people.

48
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:19,660
Rym: Mm-hmm, but in the anime club, it seemed that a Greater number of people than is statistically probable who were named Steve were also fanboys of the highest order as in Bonboys as in my favorite anime is the baby Anime Like to watch it all night.

49
00:03:19,821 --> 00:03:21,270
Scott: I sit in my room with no friends.

50
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,882
Rym: Yeah, one of them actually used to follow us around describing hentai to us.

51
00:03:25,364 --> 00:03:27,170
Rym: Yeah, like you think we're kidding.

52
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:42,750
Rym: But no, no, you just follow us around like yeah, he told me remember one day I was trying to eat my brunch at Gracie's and he starts telling me about this Disembodlement porn that he'd been looking at the previous night and I was like, ah Something I need to do and I got up to leave and I hadn't even finished my food and he's like, oh, what are you?

53
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:47,529
Rym: Up to I'll follow and I was like Something you can't come along to do.

54
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:52,705
Scott: Eventually, we got rid of that Steve by saying no one likes you.

55
00:03:52,886 --> 00:03:58,264
Rym: go well no No, we got rid of him because Pete who is not a spineless coward told him.

56
00:03:58,425 --> 00:03:59,247
Rym: No one likes you.

57
00:03:59,408 --> 00:04:00,130
Rym: Please go away.

58
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,259
Rym: Yeah, yeah, the rest of us just stood there.

59
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:02,339
Rym: Yep.

60
00:04:03,705 --> 00:04:04,750
Rym: That's the story for another time.

61
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,382
Rym: I don't know if we actually told that one or not either.

62
00:04:06,402 --> 00:04:10,990
Rym: Yeah, it doesn't matter But all of these Steve's were fanboy fanboy fanboy.

63
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,700
Rym: We were used to running this huge club and run.

64
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,390
Rym: dealing with fanboys was just the power and cars were par for the course.

65
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:17,062
Rym: We were used to it.

66
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:21,279
Rym: then Club starts up the next year and lo and behold.

67
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:23,107
Rym: There's a new member and his name is Steve.

68
00:04:23,448 --> 00:04:25,734
Scott: Oh and They weren't lying.

69
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:37,130
Rym: He's wearing this bicycle helmet, which he wore all the time as far as I could tell and This guy was a scruffy looking fanboy, but whatever a lot of people in the anime club were kind of scruffy looking.

70
00:04:37,873 --> 00:04:39,489
Rym: Then he opened his goddamn mouth.

71
00:04:40,252 --> 00:04:45,610
Scott: Got damn is not even close to the correct words that need to be used to describe his mouth.

72
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:50,466
Rym: I mean there were people before us like before the front row crew took over this club.

73
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:52,312
Rym: the crew before that They all had like.

74
00:04:52,332 --> 00:04:59,518
Rym: there was God boy and fanboy and art boy and fanboy was a slightly derogatory term But it wasn't a bad word.

75
00:04:59,558 --> 00:05:02,110
Rym: like calling someone a fanboy wasn't a terrible offense.

76
00:05:02,732 --> 00:05:06,284
Rym: We felt that this word did not do this person justice not at all.

77
00:05:06,445 --> 00:05:07,850
Rym: So we did not call him fanboy.

78
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:12,617
Rym: We called him Fanboy with with a huge emphasis.

79
00:05:12,677 --> 00:05:14,784
Rym: I mean that was his name as far as the entire.

80
00:05:14,804 --> 00:05:17,052
Scott: if you just say fanboy That's not.

81
00:05:17,092 --> 00:05:17,794
Scott: no that's not him.

82
00:05:17,975 --> 00:05:20,162
Scott: That's some other word fanboy.

83
00:05:20,182 --> 00:05:21,767
Scott: That's the correct way to say his name.

84
00:05:22,128 --> 00:05:29,410
Scott: this dude motherfucking insane Holy shit, and there's stories of him doing crazy shit outside of anime club, too.

85
00:05:29,691 --> 00:05:34,670
Rym: Yeah, like banging his head against the wall in the lab and freaking out lab attendants and screaming and yelling.

86
00:05:35,091 --> 00:05:38,060
Scott: He was a CS student and see the way CS.

87
00:05:38,221 --> 00:05:42,770
Scott: a lot of CS projects go at RIT is they have a date and then They have like a minimum due date.

88
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:55,710
Scott: And if you don't get the minimum requirement in by the minimum date Then you don't pass the class and all this stuff and you have to submit your project Electronically and this computer tests your program to make sure it works properly and all this stuff.

89
00:05:57,772 --> 00:06:00,044
Scott: So, you know, he was having trouble with his project.

90
00:06:00,084 --> 00:06:01,150
Scott: He was probably gonna fail.

91
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:11,376
Scott: I don't know if he did or not But you know, he was in this lab full of people working on their projects and you know And obviously he had some sort of social Disorder.

92
00:06:11,396 --> 00:06:17,434
Scott: Yes, it's called being a fun boy Yeah, and he was like getting up and screaming and you know The little the.

93
00:06:17,655 --> 00:06:28,459
Scott: there was like some girl who is running the lab at the time and you know She's just a person who watches the computer lab, you know and hands you your piece of paper after you print it out and you know Restarts the computer if you have trouble.

94
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,750
Rym: that was the most sought-after job in all of RIT.

95
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,710
Rym: Nothing, except your homework and you got paid.

96
00:06:34,132 --> 00:06:49,708
Scott: I mean she knows something about computer science because you know, it's a CS lab but She's not just gonna she's not supposed to tell the guy how to do his project or anything like that and this guy's like screaming and yelling and he's going crazy and he's hitting things and he hits his head against the wall.

97
00:06:49,788 --> 00:06:51,419
Scott: and Crazy guy.

98
00:06:51,742 --> 00:06:56,350
Rym: now at the anime club He was generally just disruptive and bothersome and he yelled a lot.

99
00:06:56,971 --> 00:07:00,270
Rym: I talked a lot and he talked about hentai and things we didn't want to hear about.

100
00:07:00,971 --> 00:07:10,790
Scott: Yeah, the general rule at anime club was you know, you're not supposed to talk during the show But if you have something incredibly clever to yell out, right then it's all good.

101
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:16,205
Scott: And the way you can tell this is you yell something out and if everyone laughs that was good.

102
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:19,433
Scott: if people groan That was bad.

103
00:07:19,453 --> 00:07:24,470
Scott: if people don't say anything that's also bad and it's generally sort of a one-strike deal.

104
00:07:24,991 --> 00:07:32,149
Scott: You know if you if you say funny things all the time and you don't do it too often to be annoying then You know, you got a free pass.

105
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:36,835
Scott: This guy everything he said was a groan Absolutely everything.

106
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:37,979
Rym: He just yelled stuff out.

107
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:42,681
Rym: at any anime we showed like two girls would see each other and he'd be like Oh boy, Yuri time.

108
00:07:42,701 --> 00:07:50,950
Scott: Yeah, and Generally as soon as you get one groan you're supposed to shut up forever forever and ever and ever.

109
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,436
Scott: Yeah, I mean didn't shut up.

110
00:07:52,636 --> 00:07:57,758
Rym: the primary means of punishment in the club were simply social ostracizing Ostracizing.

111
00:07:57,981 --> 00:08:03,322
Rym: Yep Ostracification There's not really a word that we wanted to use there.

112
00:08:03,342 --> 00:08:09,534
Scott: I Guess there isn't no ostracization, I guess That's what he was.

113
00:08:09,594 --> 00:08:10,739
Scott: He was ostracized.

114
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:12,044
Rym: Yeah, that didn't stop him.

115
00:08:12,204 --> 00:08:13,550
Rym: That didn't stop him.

116
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:24,430
Scott: no, he would just come up to you and try to talk about things that you didn't care about and Scary scary anime stuff and yep, like I'd be ready to start the the anime club meeting, you know, yell my classic.

117
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:25,516
Rym: Hi everybody.

118
00:08:25,536 --> 00:08:26,400
Rym: Hi Rym.

119
00:08:26,642 --> 00:08:28,150
Rym: Welcome to anime club blah blah blah blah.

120
00:08:28,471 --> 00:08:39,350
Rym: He would just kind of be standing in front of me at the front of the room and he you know The other couple hundred people are sitting down and he's just kind of standing right in front of me in my way And I'm like, could you please sit down so I can start the meeting?

121
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:48,650
Rym: now also as Fanboys do he often would work up a sweat and then there were oh, yeah, that was the same dude.

122
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,016
Rym: Yeah, it was the same dude.

123
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:52,348
Rym: So there'd be odors associated with the sweat.

124
00:08:52,388 --> 00:08:56,270
Rym: and okay Yeah, well we I'll start the first and Scott can finish what actually happened here.

125
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,759
Rym: All right We had a very strict policy on smell.

126
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:06,495
Rym: if you smell bad a member of our Administration would take you aside and tell you that you smell bad that you need to go home and shower or you're gonna be kicked Out of the club.

127
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,310
Scott: It's not kicked out of the club.

128
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,455
Scott: I thought out of the meeting.

129
00:09:09,776 --> 00:09:11,825
Rym: if you kept doing it you would be barred from the club.

130
00:09:11,845 --> 00:09:13,070
Rym: We never had to bar anyone.

131
00:09:13,275 --> 00:09:20,050
Scott: It's basically He has a crowded room full of people watching something on a screen or a crowded room full of people playing games or dancing.

132
00:09:20,673 --> 00:09:28,207
Scott: If you were giving off an odor and the people around you were disturbed we said, all right You have to leave the room and you can't come back and say you no longer give off an odor.

133
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:35,403
Rym: now We had those hundreds of pounds of soap that we had Commandeered from RIT at one point.

134
00:09:35,484 --> 00:09:40,421
Scott: basically you're out of college so they get all sorts of free shit to give out to students all the time.

135
00:09:40,662 --> 00:09:46,139
Scott: and somehow we ended up with 44 pound boxes of zest soap.

136
00:09:46,179 --> 00:09:49,270
Scott: now it was shitty soap zest rainforest, whatever.

137
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,602
Rym: This is crap soap, but they were all individually wrapped.

138
00:09:52,702 --> 00:09:54,750
Rym: and think 44 pounds per box.

139
00:09:55,172 --> 00:09:56,197
Rym: I took a box for me.

140
00:09:56,238 --> 00:09:57,263
Rym: Scott took a box for him.

141
00:09:57,323 --> 00:09:58,530
Rym: Our friend Pete took a box for him.

142
00:09:58,691 --> 00:09:59,195
Scott: So that was no.

143
00:09:59,235 --> 00:10:00,163
Rym: Pete took two boxes.

144
00:10:00,223 --> 00:10:00,848
Rym: I think Diddy.

145
00:10:00,888 --> 00:10:05,619
Scott: So 8860 76 boxes of pounds of soap.

146
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:05,901
Rym: Yep.

147
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:08,010
Scott: I mean we couldn't almost 200 pounds of soap.

148
00:10:08,091 --> 00:10:09,690
Rym: We couldn't even carry it back to the dorms.

149
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:23,131
Rym: We stashed it under some stairs in the liberal arts building and we wrote like some bullshit on them like I put a piece of paper on him and I wrote like temporary storage care of and I made up a name and then I put a number on it and I figured that would look official enough To.

150
00:10:23,151 --> 00:10:24,416
Rym: people would leave it alone and they did.

151
00:10:24,678 --> 00:10:24,939
Scott: Yeah.

152
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,330
Scott: Hey, no one took any soap out of it besides us.

153
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,595
Rym: Yeah, every time I needed soap.

154
00:10:28,655 --> 00:10:31,205
Rym: I just stopped by there open one up take whatever soap I needed.

155
00:10:31,487 --> 00:10:36,563
Scott: Yeah, so We had this soap and one of the boxes belong to the anime club.

156
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:39,816
Scott: and if someone gave off an odor You know, we try.

157
00:10:39,857 --> 00:10:44,296
Scott: we said hey we can use this soap really discreetly, you know Just kind of hand someone a soap and that's like.

158
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:45,982
Scott: now they know that they smell.

159
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:53,610
Scott: they have to go without saying you smell And everyone around here as you say it now, what would a normal human being do when given a bar of soap?

160
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:54,476
Scott: They would go.

161
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:59,962
Rym: Oh And leave shower and come back hopefully with the soap or some other kind of soap.

162
00:11:00,403 --> 00:11:00,563
Scott: Yep.

163
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:02,870
Rym: What did fanboy do?

164
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:07,149
Scott: Well, he took the soap and he rubbed it in his underarms.

165
00:11:07,512 --> 00:11:09,488
Scott: immediately a dry bar of soap.

166
00:11:09,508 --> 00:11:14,710
Rym: and Then he said thanks We were we were dumbfounded.

167
00:11:16,031 --> 00:11:19,506
Scott: This is not a. was he a homeless person before going to college.

168
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:20,430
Rym: I don't know.

169
00:11:20,811 --> 00:11:22,318
Rym: I have no idea what his deal was.

170
00:11:22,418 --> 00:11:24,970
Rym: I never will know I'll probably never see him again.

171
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,457
Scott: Yeah, thankfully very thankfully.

172
00:11:28,478 --> 00:11:31,887
Rym: I mean he really was probably the the epitome of all.

173
00:11:31,927 --> 00:11:32,770
Rym: that is fun boy.

174
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,882
Scott: Yeah, as soon as we had him the other Steve's were like, okay cool.

175
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:37,890
Scott: Yeah, you know talk about hentai whatever.

176
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:39,409
Scott: You're not rubbing soap under your arm.

177
00:11:42,391 --> 00:11:47,930
Rym: Yeah, luckily I mean smell is a problem apparently with a lot of anime clubs, but we really kind of had it under control.

178
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:50,597
Scott: Yeah, well, it's cuz he recognized the problem.

179
00:11:50,617 --> 00:11:56,349
Scott: a lot of other anime clubs and conventions where smells a problem They kind of ignore it or they don't recognize it.

180
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,430
Rym: I think a lot of those cons because they were run by people who also gave off those smells.

181
00:12:00,571 --> 00:12:02,882
Scott: Yeah, but you know by bringing the problem out into the open.

182
00:12:02,902 --> 00:12:04,509
Scott: We really were able to manage it.

183
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:09,330
Rym: Yeah, plus honestly, nothing will make a fanboy shower faster than public humiliation.

184
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:24,982
Rym: So in closing I urge you if you're at Otakon or any other big anime convention and a dude smells like an open sewer full of cheese tell him that openly Loudly and the people if you're playing DDR, it's inevitable.

185
00:12:25,022 --> 00:12:27,288
Scott: You're going to smell that's okay.

186
00:12:27,308 --> 00:12:27,890
Scott: That's okay.

187
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,645
Scott: It's just when you're done playing DDR go back to your hotel.

188
00:12:31,705 --> 00:12:32,750
Scott: Take a shower and come back.

189
00:12:33,111 --> 00:12:34,436
Rym: Yeah, I swear to God.

190
00:12:34,456 --> 00:12:38,997
Rym: if you play DDR for two hours and then you're sitting next to me at the cosplay I'm going to kill you.

191
00:12:39,017 --> 00:12:40,949
Scott: And also some people are fat.

192
00:12:41,466 --> 00:12:43,042
Scott: well you shouldn't be but you know.

193
00:12:43,143 --> 00:12:56,550
Scott: if you're fat and if you sweat a lot and smell a lot and you're waiting in line for two hours in the heat of Baltimore or wherever else your Convention may be and thus you sweat and smell after you get your badge go take a shower.

194
00:12:57,453 --> 00:13:00,683
Rym: If you don't and you're sitting next to me at the cosplay, I will kill you.

195
00:13:00,703 --> 00:13:06,968
Scott: I'll publicly humiliate you as well Which might be worse than killing considering there's tens of thousands of people there.

196
00:13:08,362 --> 00:13:24,860
