1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,700
Rym: It's Monday April 10th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,110
Rym: We talk about home networking and a bunch of other meta bits.

3
00:00:17,312 --> 00:00:18,043
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:19,511 --> 00:00:24,647
Rym: So as I've mentioned several times in the past I like to edit Wikipedia articles.

5
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,990
Rym: now I don't usually write like entirely new content.

6
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:36,530
Rym: I usually go through and fix you know Terrible grammar or people who just don't know what they're talking about or people who say that indigo children are real.

7
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,275
Rym: Yeah, that's like my pet article.

8
00:00:38,315 --> 00:00:39,899
Rym: I keep going back there and fixing it.

9
00:00:40,281 --> 00:00:43,570
Rym: But anyway, I never had an account on Wikipedia.

10
00:00:43,931 --> 00:00:50,004
Rym: I just decided that I would always just do it anonymously and I didn't really care like I never participate in the talk pages or anything.

11
00:00:50,085 --> 00:00:57,910
Rym: I just edit and The other day I was at work and I was doing something that didn't require my input and I was waiting for it to finish.

12
00:00:58,232 --> 00:01:05,128
Rym: so I'm sitting there and I decided to go check on some Wikipedia and I found an article that had a fairly glaring typo in it.

13
00:01:05,913 --> 00:01:14,646
Rym: so I go and I try to change it and I submit and Then a message pops up at the top when I reload the page saying something about an edit.

14
00:01:14,706 --> 00:01:27,790
Rym: I made recently as bad and I look and In my history page, which is basically if you don't log into Wikipedia Logging in is actually more anonymous than not logging in because if you log in you have a username.

15
00:01:28,475 --> 00:01:36,669
Rym: if you don't log in it tracks you by IP address and The IP address that I connect to Wikipedia from work with is shared by a lot of people through a net.

16
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:47,750
Rym: and I discovered that countless Indians in IBM have been writing countless Terrible articles about countless Indian things all over Wikipedia.

17
00:01:48,172 --> 00:01:58,835
Rym: They've been just like writing stuff like writing an article that has nothing in it Making new articles that are empty or just full of gibberish like all over the place to the point that the IP address I was using is being watched.

18
00:01:59,317 --> 00:02:08,509
Scott: really people from who work at IBM who are from in the country of India I say writing bad articles on on Wikipedia and in great number or is this one guy?

19
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:13,149
Rym: I think it's a bunch of guys because the topics were wide and varied over a long period of time.

20
00:02:13,571 --> 00:02:23,230
Rym: Maybe it's one guy who just like is writing about everything Indian over time Possibly but I I wish I could show you guys the page that shows my history.

21
00:02:23,451 --> 00:02:34,553
Rym: I really don't want to give away all the IP address I connect from but Suffice to say there are numerous and it's not like people are writing bad things like making up stuff about Pakistan or like just lying About India.

22
00:02:35,014 --> 00:02:39,510
Rym: It's like broken articles with bad HTML or bad wiki code.

23
00:02:40,413 --> 00:02:43,409
Scott: Wow So why does he keep doing it?

24
00:02:43,974 --> 00:02:44,627
Rym: I don't know.

25
00:02:45,051 --> 00:02:52,690
Rym: All I know is I stopped editing Wikipedia from work because I don't want my awesome edits to be intermingled with this guy's IP address.

26
00:02:53,851 --> 00:03:00,147
Scott: That's the trouble of net which we will discuss in this episode, yep I'm actually considering getting an account on Wikipedia.

27
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:09,370
Rym: now I'm waiting whether or not I'm going to get an account like just with a crazy strings I don't know who I am or if I'll just use Rym and then you guys could see what I actually do on there.

28
00:03:09,631 --> 00:03:10,413
Scott: Yeah, do that?

29
00:03:10,433 --> 00:03:17,739
Scott: you pick some crazy name and then if someone ever complains about it, you know, like anything you write Just pick a new crazy name.

30
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:20,010
Scott: Ah, just keep picking different crazy names.

31
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,719
Rym: People who complain are the Inigo children people.

32
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,309
Rym: well good they can shove it because I think they've noticed that it's always me.

33
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:29,466
Rym: Yeah, but anyway you had some medivids - didn't you?

34
00:03:29,828 --> 00:03:33,710
Scott: yes Everyone who is listening to eat nights.

35
00:03:33,871 --> 00:03:40,186
Scott: I'm gonna probably have to say this every day this week just for the people who listen to only one day Even though we learned there aren't so many of you.

36
00:03:40,792 --> 00:03:41,479
Scott: No, not it.

37
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:42,570
Scott: Well, that's another good thing.

38
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,437
Scott: You reminded me of the first thing.

39
00:03:44,697 --> 00:03:50,190
Scott: everybody here who is listening to eat nights go right now Or the next time you're sitting in the computer.

40
00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:55,486
Scott: Go to front row crew calm and on the right side of the page.

41
00:03:55,847 --> 00:03:56,629
Scott: There is a poll.

42
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:58,614
Scott: Answer this poll.

43
00:03:59,035 --> 00:04:07,758
Scott: We want to know and the poll will probably change every few weeks or so, so Repeatedly go to front row crew calm many many times.

44
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:08,159
Rym: Yes.

45
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,050
Rym: I imagine the polls will eventually include controversial topics that will then rant about.

46
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:16,829
Scott: Yes, but for now there are things that we need to know to make the podcast better for you.

47
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:19,446
Rym: So yep, mostly because it's difficult to track stats.

48
00:04:19,788 --> 00:04:25,050
Scott: Yes So if you want the podcast to improve go and vote in the polls on the side of the page.

49
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:25,893
Rym: Well, how could it improve?

50
00:04:25,953 --> 00:04:26,454
Rym: It's perfect.

51
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,119
Rym: I mean no one ever complains ever.

52
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,389
Scott: Maybe people should complain by sending email to us.

53
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:33,696
Scott: Nights at front row crew calm.

54
00:04:33,917 --> 00:04:37,046
Rym: In fact tonight's episode is proof that we do in fact read the email.

55
00:04:37,487 --> 00:04:37,748
Scott: Yes.

56
00:04:37,989 --> 00:04:49,168
Scott: Anyway so the forum Our forum is a little different and a little more advanced and a little less advanced in some ways than PHPBB and VBUL and then all those other forums.

57
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:53,069
Rym: Yep I will say that most of the people who use it seem to really like it once they get the hang of it.

58
00:04:53,330 --> 00:05:00,351
Scott: Yeah, our forum runs on lusimo vanilla software, which is wicked almost web 2.0.

59
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:01,899
Scott: Awesome forums of crazy.

60
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:06,281
Rym: You can say lusimo, but you don't say Ubuntu Ubuntu Ubuntu.

61
00:05:06,483 --> 00:05:22,062
Scott: All right anyway The way this forum works is instead of just joining you apply for membership and then within like a few hours I noticed that you applied for membership and I click approve and you get an email saying You are welcome to the forums.

62
00:05:22,163 --> 00:05:23,129
Scott: come back and sign in.

63
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:35,950
Scott: Well, it seems that some people have some sort of bad spam filter that will filter out Completely not spam, you know because some people are dumb with email they use like hotmail or stupid shit like that.

64
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:47,746
Scott: So to the following people you have been approved and you have accounts on our forum Come sign in and talk with us many times because it should just work.

65
00:05:47,786 --> 00:05:49,150
Rym: We didn't deny you or anything.

66
00:05:49,150 --> 00:06:08,044
Scott: Yeah, and to all those people who like do have accounts and have logged in at least once bookmark the forum and keep coming back and to anyone doesn't have an account in the forum come and apply and if you don't get An email within like eight hours saying you have been approved membership Just send us an email and I will tell you if I approved you so far.

67
00:06:08,144 --> 00:06:09,970
Scott: I have not rejected anybody.

68
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,514
Scott: Yep, it's basically.

69
00:06:11,555 --> 00:06:15,887
Scott: I'm only gonna reject you if you're obviously someone who's gonna spam the forum or something.

70
00:06:16,148 --> 00:06:16,729
Rym: and don't worry.

71
00:06:16,769 --> 00:06:19,318
Rym: Mr Period does not have the power to deny you.

72
00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:20,021
Scott: No, he doesn't.

73
00:06:20,482 --> 00:06:22,329
Scott: So yeah, these are the people right now.

74
00:06:22,892 --> 00:06:36,682
Scott: ace bellarm Colin Burkett see dac rule 427 The Roach digital monkey fuzzy Ed spirit fiend Z-mang 86 or Z-man g86.

75
00:06:36,803 --> 00:06:46,028
Scott: I don't know the reviewer Manda, but M&D are in little square brackets and there's someone who's obviously really really trying to get into the forums.

76
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:49,449
Scott: first He tried to sign in as like flammer guy.

77
00:06:50,132 --> 00:06:56,130
Scott: Then he tried to get another account as the flaming geek and I think he thinks he was rejected because he hasn't been back.

78
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,637
Scott: But I approved both of those accounts.

79
00:06:59,138 --> 00:07:01,986
Scott: pick one of them sign in and I'll delete the other one.

80
00:07:02,468 --> 00:07:04,000
Scott: you were approved You're not rejected.

81
00:07:04,182 --> 00:07:04,567
Scott: come back.

82
00:07:05,144 --> 00:07:05,290
Rym: Yeah.

83
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:12,059
Rym: And for anyone who joined the forums like early early on a long time ago when we first started and thought hey There's no one here and never came back.

84
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:13,690
Rym: There's a lot of people in there.

85
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,440
Rym: In fact, someone just someone on their own started a new flame war.

86
00:07:16,941 --> 00:07:21,413
Scott: Yeah, there is a talking in the forum Pretty much on the hour.

87
00:07:21,973 --> 00:07:28,085
Scott: So if more people come they'll be talking on the half-hour perhaps on the 10-minute and It'd be cool.

88
00:07:29,111 --> 00:07:36,010
Rym: So anyway in the news we have only one news today because we got some audio feedback from our GeekNights resident scientist Peter Olson.

89
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:41,298
Rym: hooray Now first off the news.

90
00:07:41,941 --> 00:07:42,182
Rym: we didn't.

91
00:07:42,303 --> 00:07:43,710
Rym: I mean there was a lot of news over the weekend.

92
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:49,455
Rym: We could talk about any number of things and I think we're going to spread about over the week because they're all fairly Relevant or important.

93
00:07:50,076 --> 00:07:54,590
Rym: but this one isn't really a news per se just a topic that's been coming up more and more lately.

94
00:07:55,250 --> 00:08:00,581
Scott: black hats That means those Hackers that aren't cool you.

95
00:08:00,602 --> 00:08:05,947
Scott: they don't want to be your friend They want to spam you and zombie you and all those other bad things see.

96
00:08:05,967 --> 00:08:10,746
Rym: a long time ago It used to be that hackers were the good guys who messed with technology and they

97
00:08:10,786 --> 00:08:11,690
Scott: still are the good guys

98
00:08:12,113 --> 00:08:18,550
Rym: And this is the old terminology the way I mean There are some people who really have a bug up their butt about this and hackers were the good guys.

99
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,553
Rym: They mess with technology.

100
00:08:19,573 --> 00:08:21,278
Rym: They protect you from crackers.

101
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:29,742
Rym: crackers were the guys who broke into things and did evil and The terms all got mixed up and then new terms came out now.

102
00:08:29,822 --> 00:08:31,829
Rym: It's a white hat as in the good guys.

103
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:34,317
Rym: Black hat as in the bad guys.

104
00:08:34,758 --> 00:08:38,409
Rym: red hat is in that crappy Linux distribution and ass hat.

105
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:44,250
Scott: You forgot gray hat those guys who are like good guys, but then they're also bad guys.

106
00:08:45,451 --> 00:08:57,594
Rym: Yeah, you can make up your own hats but black hat is very well-defined and it basically means people on the internet or Alvar networks or in some way evil Usually spammers.

107
00:08:58,177 --> 00:09:07,669
Rym: Yeah, that's pretty much the primary thing spyware dudes And there's been a lot of news about attacks and extortion and DD OS's and things cropping up again.

108
00:09:08,212 --> 00:09:11,429
Rym: Yeah, this really hasn't been an issue for a long time and it's starting to come back.

109
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:39,210
Scott: Well, the primary attack vector seems to be get a bunch of Windows machines and put a virus on them which is not too hard to do and Connect them with some sort of IRC bot thing So that you go to an IRC channel and you type in some secret commands there and the bots You know all those thousands of window machines talk back to you in that IRC channel and you can control them and make them do Your bidding, you know, you can say all you Windows machines that I have collected DDS that guy

110
00:09:40,332 --> 00:09:41,099
Rym: OS stands for

111
00:09:43,413 --> 00:09:44,630
Scott: Denial absurd distributed

112
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,555
Rym: Distributed denial of service.

113
00:09:47,736 --> 00:09:52,766
Rym: It's like say you got a thousand pcs under your control and you tell them all to ping one, dude until he goes down.

114
00:09:53,432 --> 00:10:11,110
Scott: imagine if there was like a guy who had a grocery store and you basically Brainwashed a million people on the street and you said hey grocery store guy either you give me all your money or I'm gonna fill Your grocery store with a million of these zombie people I brainwashed and no one's gonna be able to shop in your store ever again.

115
00:10:11,591 --> 00:10:13,619
Rym: It's a decent analogy and that's pretty much what happens.

116
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:13,960
Rym: Yep.

117
00:10:14,221 --> 00:10:17,253
Rym: It's more common than you'd think a lot of times.

118
00:10:17,273 --> 00:10:23,896
Scott: what happens is the people who are threatened or Blackmailed or whatever you extorted.

119
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:30,950
Scott: they won't say they were extorted because well, you know If they do the guy will just send the zombies anyway.

120
00:10:31,611 --> 00:10:40,223
Rym: Yep, plus I mean there's been a lot a lot of talk about banks and financial institutions lately and about course This is kind of an old problem how they won't let on.

121
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:47,813
Rym: if they get compromised They'll just pay the guy because the police aren't gonna track him down and if they admit that they got hacked That's the end of that bank.

122
00:10:48,395 --> 00:10:55,201
Scott: Yeah, if a banks like yeah, we were hacked by this guy and he took a zillion dollars No one's gonna put their money in that bank anymore.

123
00:10:55,241 --> 00:11:02,408
Rym: Everyone's gonna be like, well, I'll put my money That and every hacker in the world is get well cracker in the world is gonna attack that bank.

124
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:03,992
Scott: Yep Oh, really?

125
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:08,925
Scott: Your your bank was hacked a and successfully and you paid the guy off, huh?

126
00:11:09,446 --> 00:11:10,048
Scott: Oh, you know what?

127
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,135
Scott: I Won't even bother hacking you.

128
00:11:12,176 --> 00:11:14,447
Scott: I'm just gonna call you up and say I hacked you and ask for money.

129
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:26,107
Rym: now There was a time I don't think many of our listeners are old enough to remember but the the early middling days of IRC When IRC was like the primary mode of cool internet guy communication.

130
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:29,960
Rym: now IRC is a cesspool but and that it was a summer.

131
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,284
Scott: It's okay, but not much.

132
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,708
Rym: Yeah, it's mostly a cesspool.

133
00:11:32,989 --> 00:11:37,703
Scott: mostly There is a few places that are like, you know cordoned off or like.

134
00:11:37,723 --> 00:11:38,947
Scott: there's an open source area.

135
00:11:39,007 --> 00:11:45,570
Scott: That's kind of okay Yeah, and there's some like, you know specialized geek channels here and there but a lot of comics.

136
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,814
Scott: Most of it is just blah.

137
00:11:47,136 --> 00:11:53,939
Rym: Yeah, and back then there was this rise of script kitty Horrible assholes who would just?

138
00:11:53,959 --> 00:12:02,543
Rym: they basically had gang turf wars in IRC over channels and they'd fight each other with these botnets and scripts and everything and it got really bad.

139
00:12:02,904 --> 00:12:15,860
Rym: and then as technology improved and a Lot of normal people who don't know about that sort of thing flooded the internet and IRC died the problem disappeared or at least retreated to the fringes of the internet and If the news is to be believed it's coming back.

140
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:17,462
Scott: Awesome.

141
00:12:17,622 --> 00:12:21,614
Rym: now, I'm of two minds on this because one I haven't been attacked at all.

142
00:12:21,935 --> 00:12:23,500
Scott: Like we won't be we're running Linux.

143
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:26,919
Scott: It's kind of a very very difficult to attack us.

144
00:12:27,744 --> 00:12:43,977
Rym: But - I just I wonder because when you see these articles I almost get the feeling that they're being written by people who are being paid by various anti spyware or Antivirus companies or firewall companies who want people to be afraid so that they'll buy their products.

145
00:12:44,840 --> 00:13:01,066
Scott: I Agree, especially since Microsoft seems to actually be upping the security a little bit and as time goes on sure, there is still a hajillion Windows machines out there being compromised, but It's not because people don't have anything available them to secure themselves.

146
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:02,809
Scott: It's because people are stupid.

147
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:09,108
Scott: So as Used to be everyone was vulnerable even us, you know using Windows to play games or something.

148
00:13:09,128 --> 00:13:10,390
Scott: We'd be out in the open and fucked.

149
00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:22,690
Rym: But now the only people out in the open and fucked are the people are stupid and it's decreasing daily because honestly one thing that's Really prevented attacks on most normal people out there is war routers and net which we're going to talk about today.

150
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:35,670
Rym: Hooray, if you're behind a router and the routers running that so your computer is not directly connected to the internet with a bare IP You're safe from 90% of the non user initiated attacks that are out there.

151
00:13:35,798 --> 00:13:49,289
Scott: Yeah The only way someone can get you then is if they trick you with something stupid like you visit a website with ie that's got a thing on it or you Download an email attachment or you click on a phishing scam or something like that.

152
00:13:49,616 --> 00:14:02,810
Rym: Yep But I just I want to warn people that even though I think a lot of this Blackhat resurgence is overhyped and possibly false The internet if you go at it like a direct connection to the internet is basically the Wild West.

153
00:14:03,353 --> 00:14:06,450
Rym: It is just that it is filled with the sea of dangerous things.

154
00:14:07,191 --> 00:14:07,894
Scott: there are these things.

155
00:14:07,974 --> 00:14:08,978
Scott: this is pieces of software.

156
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:11,670
Scott: not gonna explain too much of this because you can try to do a whole episode.

157
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:21,230
Scott: and called honeypots and think of a honeypot is like this you um Let's say that it was pirate town and you had a treasure chest, but the church just had didn't really have treasure in it.

158
00:14:21,511 --> 00:14:22,939
Scott: It just looked like it had treasure in it.

159
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:31,670
Scott: Yeah, whenever a pirate came to get the treasure There was a little man inside the church just to write down which pirate came to check the treasure and what he tried to do.

160
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:33,790
Rym: So after a month, you've got a list of all the pirates.

161
00:14:34,192 --> 00:14:35,537
Scott: Yeah, you got a list of all the pirates.

162
00:14:35,638 --> 00:14:38,430
Scott: You got a list of the techniques pirates are using to steal treasure.

163
00:14:39,116 --> 00:14:40,850
Scott: You got all kinds of information on pirates.

164
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:46,229
Scott: So people put these honeypots out there and on the internet and try to see who tries to hack it.

165
00:14:46,691 --> 00:14:48,942
Rym: Millions and millions and millions.

166
00:14:49,344 --> 00:14:54,924
Scott: Yeah, we're talking Insane like within days you'll get crazy hacking attempts.

167
00:14:55,245 --> 00:14:56,249
Scott: Just I don't know where.

168
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:01,830
Scott: Successful ones who knows but just packing attempts come all the time to random brand new computers.

169
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,204
Scott: They've never been on the internet before.

170
00:15:03,608 --> 00:15:07,366
Scott: guys We'll just discover these computers and hack them when we move back into RIT.

171
00:15:07,386 --> 00:15:10,320
Rym: in our apartment Scott Ed was building a new Windows XP.

172
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,004
Scott: Well, that was cuz.

173
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:12,230
Scott: I did it at a bad time.

174
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,635
Scott: It was there was a worm going around.

175
00:15:13,675 --> 00:15:17,330
Rym: Yeah, but even then it's still pretty dangerous out there.

176
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,270
Scott: It's real dangerous.

177
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:23,105
Rym: Of course either running Linux or being behind a firewall saves you from 99% of that or both.

178
00:15:24,974 --> 00:15:26,429
Scott: Yeah, both is very good.

179
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:32,187
Rym: But anyway that aside the other we don't have another news today instead.

180
00:15:32,227 --> 00:15:33,170
Rym: We have the audio feedback.

181
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,339
Rym: Like I said now, I believe was last Thursday.

182
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:42,430
Rym: We talked a lot about evolution and various Quote-unquote missing links that have been discovered recently seems to be the hot topic of the past year.

183
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:46,925
Rym: So yep, and Peter had something interesting and enlightening to say about that.

184
00:15:47,427 --> 00:15:50,750
Guest: Hooray Hey guys, it's Pete.

185
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:59,264
Guest: Just thought I'd chime in about the topic of evolution since it's come up this past Thursday and it's been in the news quite a bit this past week and shed some light on it.

186
00:15:59,284 --> 00:16:04,390
Guest: do a little explaining and Just generally kind of expound a bit on evolution.

187
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:06,137
Guest: I guess I'll start by defining it.

188
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:13,565
Guest: evolution the word as in the phenomenon of Evolution is defined as changes in the allele frequencies of a population over time.

189
00:16:13,846 --> 00:16:15,110
Guest: That's the modern definition.

190
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,295
Guest: It used to be a lot simpler.

191
00:16:16,495 --> 00:16:20,230
Guest: simpler just, you know changes in organisms that sort of thing.

192
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,729
Guest: But it's very specifically changes in allele frequencies.

193
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,049
Guest: Alleles are basically settings of genes.

194
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,016
Guest: You know genes are the unit of inheritance.

195
00:16:29,057 --> 00:16:33,109
Guest: That's how characteristics get passed from one organism to its successive generation.

196
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:39,910
Guest: and Allele of a gene is sort of like a setting basically of that gene like an option for that gene.

197
00:16:40,391 --> 00:16:41,474
Guest: Good example is eye color.

198
00:16:42,316 --> 00:16:47,730
Guest: if you have one gene that controls the eye color you will have several alleles of that gene.

199
00:16:49,171 --> 00:16:52,402
Guest: Each instance of the eye color will be its own allele.

200
00:16:52,783 --> 00:16:57,218
Guest: So you have like a blue allele or a red allele Or green allele or something like that.

201
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:12,587
Guest: So changes in the allele frequencies of a population over time really just means sort of changes in the proportion of the proportion of How often a given characteristic is expressed in a population.

202
00:17:12,646 --> 00:17:16,618
Guest: if something becomes More dominant while something else becomes less dominant.

203
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:28,323
Guest: Well, that's that's a form of evolution and it's in a population of organisms this is key to note population, which is not necessarily a species as a whole and just refers to a Subset of a species.

204
00:17:28,404 --> 00:17:31,001
Guest: It's typically Geographically located.

205
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:31,929
Guest: something like that.

206
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:46,749
Guest: The way evolution works the theory of evolution Describes the mechanisms by which it occurs And we have quite a bit of information as to that, you know genetic inheritance and mutations and all this stuff.

207
00:17:47,532 --> 00:17:54,115
Guest: It's important to note that the way evolution works is by making several successive small changes Over a period of time.

208
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:56,424
Guest: that eventually adds up to larger changes.

209
00:17:56,444 --> 00:18:10,556
Guest: It's actually a quote from Darwin about how you could Show his theory wrong and if it would be demonstrated that any complex organ existed Which cannot possibly have been formed by numerous successive slight modifications My theory would absolutely break down

210
00:18:10,837 --> 00:18:11,319
Scott: which is true

211
00:18:11,781 --> 00:18:17,875
Guest: if you could have something that would not have evolved by this this Successive changes.

212
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:20,488
Guest: and it's it's a blow to evolution.

213
00:18:20,528 --> 00:18:21,593
Guest: there That's.

214
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:22,777
Guest: there's basically how it operates.

215
00:18:22,818 --> 00:18:25,930
Guest: a lot of people separate micro evolution and macro evolution.

216
00:18:27,074 --> 00:18:28,829
Guest: This is something I'll clear up for your benefit.

217
00:18:29,751 --> 00:18:34,830
Guest: Micro evolution usually refers to evolution in microorganisms small like bacteria and such.

218
00:18:35,231 --> 00:18:39,583
Guest: Macro evolution is evolution as it applies to large animals and such.

219
00:18:39,864 --> 00:18:43,735
Guest: they're the same process exactly the same 100% same process.

220
00:18:44,197 --> 00:18:51,670
Guest: the reason that people separate it out is because you can actually see evolution And observe it very readily in microorganisms.

221
00:18:52,273 --> 00:18:54,784
Guest: That's because they have very quick generation times.

222
00:18:55,346 --> 00:19:02,790
Guest: in 24 hours You can increase the population of a culture of E. Coli by several orders of magnitude just overnight.

223
00:19:03,212 --> 00:19:07,930
Guest: You can't exactly increase the population of elephants by several orders of magnitude overnight.

224
00:19:08,493 --> 00:19:11,650
Guest: That's kind of why you don't see great sweeping.

225
00:19:11,871 --> 00:19:24,337
Guest: You know you won't see changes coming about that quickly in organisms that have long gestation periods that sort of thing Because obviously the only way these traits are arise will arise is with Reproduction and such.

226
00:19:24,377 --> 00:19:29,796
Guest: that's how genes get carried forward and expressed And that's that's that.

227
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:57,989
Guest: so the the idea of evolution think the idea that that organisms change over time has been around since about the mid 1700s and basically the idea arose from observing like the fossil record and Doing studies of animals and such and what scientists found is that there's a lot of Ancestor species a lot of stuff they observed and you know fossils from a long time ago.

228
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:05,656
Guest: These organs are these structures are analogs of these structures exist in creatures today and they said I wonder why that is.

229
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:20,347
Guest: and the from that evolution kind of came about and Basically we've had tons of evidence that that changes actually occur and that we have shared Characteristics and shared structures and common ancestry for some time.

230
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:29,210
Guest: as I said Studying structures of past organisms very specifically if you study if you were to look at say the skeleton of a fish.

231
00:20:30,351 --> 00:20:34,104
Guest: you'll notice it has some structures that look very similar to the things you would see in a human.

232
00:20:34,124 --> 00:20:40,430
Guest: it has like a definable ribcage in the spine and stuff and Actually fish have a structure known as gill arches.

233
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:44,949
Guest: They're kind of like these basically rib like things that are used to support the gills themselves.

234
00:20:45,552 --> 00:20:48,061
Guest: Humans actually have that structure in them.

235
00:20:48,161 --> 00:20:54,775
Guest: It's it's up in the neck region I believe it's kind of those those cartilaginous rings Around your trachea.

236
00:20:55,197 --> 00:20:57,266
Guest: Those are um, those are gill arches.

237
00:20:57,386 --> 00:20:58,210
Guest: That's exactly what they are.

238
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:02,328
Guest: They don't do anything for you because you know, you don't have gills, but that's exactly what they are.

239
00:21:04,651 --> 00:21:09,610
Guest: There's a species of fish and forget what it is off the bat, but it basically has a shoulder for its front flippers.

240
00:21:09,992 --> 00:21:18,990
Guest: it's kind of this round nub to which a fin is attached and That structure was carried through to tetrapods and such.

241
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,898
Guest: That's actually in the one animal.

242
00:21:21,938 --> 00:21:26,470
Guest: that Rym mentioned on Thursday the link between seagoing creatures and land-based creatures.

243
00:21:26,851 --> 00:21:27,554
Guest: It's kind of what it is.

244
00:21:27,594 --> 00:21:31,770
Guest: It's like this fish like thing with some limbs to it basically or limb like things.

245
00:21:32,272 --> 00:21:35,650
Guest: Well, really your arm is just a heavily modified fin.

246
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:46,123
Guest: that's all it really is and the shoulder structure has been around for some time and Skeletons and such to see these very similar structures.

247
00:21:46,786 --> 00:21:48,989
Guest: I mentioned the appendix on the forums.

248
00:21:49,915 --> 00:22:00,610
Guest: The appendix is a vestigial structure in humans But it actually has function in some species today and it had function in previous herbivorous species progenitor organisms.

249
00:22:01,455 --> 00:22:02,220
Guest: But it's this thing.

250
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,870
Guest: We've just had kicking around for all this time.

251
00:22:05,131 --> 00:22:07,840
Guest: So evolution that's you know, just how evolution occurs.

252
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:14,263
Guest: you start with one thing you modify it a little bit and it gets passed on The link.

253
00:22:14,605 --> 00:22:23,156
Guest: these these links that have been recently found they always talk about missing links and such are Really great to have like the link between homo erectus and homo sapiens.

254
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:31,380
Guest: It's great to have But for most scientists, it's not really like necessary evidence that we've been digging for forever.

255
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:38,260
Guest: We just keep digging for more evidence to further solidify our theories, but it's been a pretty solid theory for some time.

256
00:22:38,882 --> 00:22:42,180
Guest: You know, we've known that that links like that have existed.

257
00:22:43,002 --> 00:22:48,519
Guest: We even have living organisms that are kind of links themselves the lungfish for example.

258
00:22:49,961 --> 00:22:59,224
Guest: that's that's a great link between a Seagoing creatures and and current land-based creatures.

259
00:22:59,405 --> 00:23:05,648
Guest: can you know jump from pond to pond if it has to and when a pond dries up and can bury itself Mud keeps up moist and breathe air.

260
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:08,360
Guest: It's an air-breathing fish has limb like fins.

261
00:23:09,841 --> 00:23:19,520
Guest: So really these discoveries that Rym is brought up while they're uh, they're nifty and such Scientists haven't had a problem believing that evolution is occurring.

262
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:32,247
Guest: It's really only the creationists and other people like that that really seem to have a problem with it despite all scientific evidence that's been shown at them and It's probably gonna stay that way for a while.

263
00:23:32,307 --> 00:23:36,580
Guest: every time some discovery like this is made most people just basically move the goalposts.

264
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:44,637
Guest: They say well You can't you can't you know, you don't have a species in between these two now And then you won't have a species in between those two and etc, etc.

265
00:23:46,581 --> 00:23:51,894
Guest: But the theory itself the concept that evolution occurs has been set in science for some time.

266
00:23:51,914 --> 00:24:02,590
Guest: I mean, it's widely accepted and the Being studied and we have a pretty good working of working understanding of that.

267
00:24:03,332 --> 00:24:07,989
Guest: So, uh, don't be too thrown off by Anything you might read any time.

268
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,560
Guest: the media says we were missing link discovered.

269
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,448
Guest: Just remember that there really aren't missing links.

270
00:24:12,488 --> 00:24:13,290
Guest: There are just links.

271
00:24:13,671 --> 00:24:15,315
Guest: We've known about them for some time.

272
00:24:16,017 --> 00:24:19,221
Guest: So, uh, that's it and Yeah, I'm out.

273
00:24:26,227 --> 00:24:26,968
Rym: So that aside.

274
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:28,229
Rym: What is your thing of the day?

275
00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:32,039
Scott: Oh, that's right We can't get enough of Chuck Norris, can we?

276
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,950
Scott: god damn it god damn god damn.

277
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:39,148
Scott: I got another check Norris thing of the day and there's not a god damn thing you can do about it.

278
00:24:41,171 --> 00:24:44,524
Scott: This Chuck Norris thing of the day is brought to you by Soul Calibur 3.

279
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:44,846
Scott: Oh, really?

280
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:47,100
Scott: Oh, yeah, really cuz.

281
00:24:47,161 --> 00:24:53,870
Scott: in Soul Calibur 3 Apparently you have the ability to create brand new characters that look like you want and fight like you want and all that good stuff.

282
00:24:53,995 --> 00:24:58,295
Scott: so someone had the Foresight to create Chuck Norris.

283
00:24:58,917 --> 00:25:01,323
Rym: now Chuck Norris seems to only have one move.

284
00:25:01,343 --> 00:25:03,770
Scott: Oh, I wonder what move it could be.

285
00:25:04,521 --> 00:25:04,929
Rym: I don't know.

286
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:11,258
Rym: All I know is that if you watch the video you will see that Chuck Norris can defeat any opponent with one Swiftly placed roundhouse kick to the face.

287
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,105
Scott: really does he have any other moves?

288
00:25:13,747 --> 00:25:14,410
Rym: I don't think so.

289
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,155
Scott: No, how much damage did it do?

290
00:25:16,757 --> 00:25:18,363
Scott: all of it all of it.

291
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:19,868
Rym: you say yes all of it.

292
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:35,309
Scott: Ah well, you know what if I was Wanting to have any chance of surviving the pending Chuck Norris apocalypse I would watch this video because it's really the only thing you can do to Prepare yourself for the impending roundhouse doom.

293
00:25:35,651 --> 00:25:38,359
Rym: just remember if you can see Chuck Norris he can see you.

294
00:25:38,379 --> 00:25:47,209
Scott: if you cannot see Chuck Norris were seconds from death and If anyone tries to play with Chuck Norris in a Soul Calibur 3 tournament, I'll just forfeit right away.

295
00:25:48,997 --> 00:25:54,627
Rym: This is not fair All right, so along the line we have two video game things today here now.

296
00:25:54,727 --> 00:25:59,989
Rym: mine though I guess I mean Scott's was Chuck Norris related and mine is actually more baseball related.

297
00:26:00,871 --> 00:26:02,601
Scott: Baseball just started like days ago.

298
00:26:02,883 --> 00:26:03,104
Rym: Yeah.

299
00:26:03,366 --> 00:26:17,115
Rym: Well, basically someone took the game six of the 1986 World Series between The Mets and the Red Sox and they reenacted it in NES RBI baseball.

300
00:26:17,136 --> 00:26:18,881
Scott: well, they reenacted the last inning.

301
00:26:19,182 --> 00:26:21,970
Rym: now for anyone who doesn't know it looks like they reenacted the entire game.

302
00:26:22,151 --> 00:26:22,673
Scott: Oh, really?

303
00:26:22,733 --> 00:26:23,658
Scott: Yeah, just skip to the left.

304
00:26:23,698 --> 00:26:24,883
Rym: I skipped all around.

305
00:26:25,165 --> 00:26:25,647
Scott: Oh, wow.

306
00:26:25,687 --> 00:26:25,928
Scott: It's long.

307
00:26:26,591 --> 00:26:39,570
Scott: Okay, because for anyone who doesn't know basically at the very last thing in this game if the Red Sox had won this game They would have won the World Series in 1986 and the curse would have been defeated then instead of two years ago.

308
00:26:40,553 --> 00:26:41,722
Scott: So, you know who won already?

309
00:26:41,763 --> 00:26:42,589
Scott: I guess I spoiled it.

310
00:26:43,132 --> 00:26:45,203
Scott: The only reason I know this is because I'm a Mets fan.

311
00:26:45,284 --> 00:26:47,856
Scott: if it was any other World Series I would have known dick about it.

312
00:26:48,418 --> 00:26:52,816
Rym: Yeah, all these guys did is they took the radio Commentary from the game.

313
00:26:52,897 --> 00:26:54,944
Scott: I think it was the TV commentary doesn't matter.

314
00:26:55,386 --> 00:27:01,186
Rym: They're usually similar Yeah, and they took RBI baseball and they reenacted the game play for play.

315
00:27:01,849 --> 00:27:06,369
Rym: That's it yeah, and it's it's kind of fascinating to watch.

316
00:27:06,389 --> 00:27:17,029
Scott: and the scary part is they must have like Saved state and redid each thing until they got exactly the ball hit, you know the way they wanted to.

317
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,677
Rym: yeah Because it's pretty much dead on.

318
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:21,190
Scott: it's really dead on except for one thing.

319
00:27:21,757 --> 00:27:22,809
Scott: This is how close it is.

320
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:28,949
Scott: The only difference was in the ninth inning the guy the first baseman makes like an error and the ball goes by him.

321
00:27:29,892 --> 00:27:33,662
Scott: Instead of that the ball like was in front of him instead of behind him.

322
00:27:34,023 --> 00:27:34,826
Scott: Yeah, that's how.

323
00:27:34,926 --> 00:27:36,190
Scott: that's how accurate this is.

324
00:27:36,835 --> 00:27:42,075
Scott: so if you've never Experienced the Insane tension that this amazing.

325
00:27:42,095 --> 00:27:43,902
Scott: This is was a pretty good game of baseball.

326
00:27:44,143 --> 00:27:47,254
Scott: I mean in terms of games of baseball in history This is a pretty good one to watch.

327
00:27:47,795 --> 00:27:51,567
Scott: So this is a pretty entertaining way to watch it if you've never seen it.

328
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:54,876
Rym: Yep Now anyway moving on to our main bit.

329
00:27:55,699 --> 00:27:59,430
Rym: I believe we actually got the idea for this from some reader feedback.

330
00:27:59,772 --> 00:28:08,981
Scott: Yeah, someone finally listened to us and emailed us Like I've been telling you to do I don't know how many times this episode Because this is the Scott tells everyone to do feedback episodes.

331
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:11,890
Rym: So here is proof that if you email us we read it.

332
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,617
Rym: We don't always respond, but we read it.

333
00:28:13,738 --> 00:28:14,521
Scott: Yep this more.

334
00:28:14,561 --> 00:28:15,284
Scott: I just responded.

335
00:28:15,384 --> 00:28:18,403
Scott: actually this today I got an email from Greg Carpenter.

336
00:28:18,483 --> 00:28:19,229
Scott: Hey Greg, what's up?

337
00:28:20,112 --> 00:28:34,030
Scott: Yo, he gave us some ideas for some Monday episodes some of which were good and some of which were not so good, but Anyway, there's a. we're gonna do two of them today one Because one of them is actually a good one and the other one will take us five seconds.

338
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,255
Scott: So he figured why the hell not?

339
00:28:35,396 --> 00:28:35,637
Scott: All right.

340
00:28:35,697 --> 00:28:38,630
Rym: So Scott, why don't you ask us the question that he asked?

341
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:39,995
Scott: Well, he didn't ask a question.

342
00:28:40,035 --> 00:28:42,690
Scott: He just gives ideas for Monday idea Monday shows.

343
00:28:43,271 --> 00:28:49,950
Scott: So the first idea for Monday shows I want to talk about was what certifications do you recommend people get now?

344
00:28:50,792 --> 00:28:58,053
Scott: if you don't know a certification is Like this a-plus and Cisco and MS whatever MSCE.

345
00:28:58,315 --> 00:29:11,410
Scott: what it is is if you're a computer or IT professional You can go pay money to study this thing and take a test and when if you pass the test You get like this little badge of honor that you can put on your resume and your business card and all that.

346
00:29:11,811 --> 00:29:19,892
Scott: You can say I am a Microsoft certified computer engineer or I am a Cisco certified blah blah blah One.

347
00:29:20,072 --> 00:29:21,738
Rym: they cost a lot of money to.

348
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:24,246
Rym: the tests aren't really that difficult.

349
00:29:24,286 --> 00:29:25,169
Rym: They're just annoying.

350
00:29:25,189 --> 00:29:30,850
Rym: and Three the only companies that care about them are companies that you probably don't want to work for.

351
00:29:31,151 --> 00:29:43,496
Scott: yeah, basically if you're going to be working for a smart person someone who knows about Computers and is not a giant evil company or a giant pile of stupid crap You don't need a certification.

352
00:29:43,556 --> 00:29:50,429
Scott: In fact, those people smart people would look and say wow, you have a bunch of certifications You must be stupid as shit.

353
00:29:50,851 --> 00:29:59,274
Rym: Yep, I mean basically if you have a degree as in a Bachelor of Science in computer technology or IT or information technology computer Science anything like that.

354
00:29:59,676 --> 00:30:00,519
Rym: You're pretty much golden.

355
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:05,299
Rym: Anyway, if you don't have a degree Certifications are better than nothing.

356
00:30:05,581 --> 00:30:06,929
Rym: if you have a degree they're useless.

357
00:30:08,031 --> 00:30:18,456
Scott: Yeah, I mean if you have a chance to get one for relatively little money and little time spent like if there's someone giving out like free tests or Certification test five bucks or

358
00:30:18,476 --> 00:30:23,155
Rym: your company says hey take the certification and we'll promote you and we'll pay for all the time You spend learning it.

359
00:30:23,477 --> 00:30:29,446
Scott: Yeah, go for it, but Getting certifications to like try to boost your resume.

360
00:30:29,466 --> 00:30:30,170
Scott: It's not a good idea.

361
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:42,482
Rym: Yeah, in fact, even if you have certifications, I'd put them on your resume But I wouldn't put them in any sort of place of honor and I wouldn't bring them up while I was at the interview Unless someone asked about them in which case I'd be perfectly honest.

362
00:30:42,522 --> 00:30:46,438
Scott: I would say oh those certifications Yeah, I just took that one cuz someone paid for it.

363
00:30:46,518 --> 00:30:49,128
Scott: And yeah, that one was really easy.

364
00:30:49,209 --> 00:31:02,026
Scott: Whatever Yeah, or if the company you're applying for is dumb Yeah if basically if I was hiring someone and you came in and introduced yourself as As I am a someone someone certified I'd be like, all right, you're done.

365
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:06,518
Scott: Yeah, pretty much Okay, that's all I got to say on certifications.

366
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:06,799
Rym: Yep.

367
00:31:06,859 --> 00:31:09,870
Rym: So we killed a show and now we can do another show on home networking.

368
00:31:10,111 --> 00:31:10,292
Scott: Yep.

369
00:31:10,413 --> 00:31:12,644
Scott: Oh, well first I forgot to mention the movie guys.

370
00:31:12,945 --> 00:31:15,398
Scott: All right, right This is probably the last time you mentioned them.

371
00:31:15,438 --> 00:31:18,252
Scott: unless we interact with them again, which I'm sure we will I'm sure we will.

372
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:18,774
Rym: they're cool.

373
00:31:18,955 --> 00:31:21,323
Scott: Yeah, so remember last week.

374
00:31:21,403 --> 00:31:29,350
Scott: You might not have listened to the episode but The guy rich from our forum who also does a podcast of his own called movies.

375
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:32,461
Scott: You should see where they talk about movies that you should see.

376
00:31:32,983 --> 00:31:36,437
Scott: there are a bunch of middle-aged British people And you said middle-aged again.

377
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:37,462
Rym: She's gonna freaking kill you.

378
00:31:37,522 --> 00:31:38,386
Scott: I know isn't that great?

379
00:31:38,627 --> 00:31:40,534
Rym: See I'm okay I agree with her now.

380
00:31:40,875 --> 00:31:42,459
Rym: It's not 32 isn't middle-aged?

381
00:31:42,881 --> 00:31:45,167
Rym: because the count of Monte Cristo was badass.

382
00:31:45,207 --> 00:31:45,889
Rym: He was like 40 something.

383
00:31:46,632 --> 00:31:48,760
Scott: Yeah, I think your people live to like 80 90 these days.

384
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,241
Scott: So 40 45 is middle-aged.

385
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:54,624
Rym: Mathematically speaking I get my line.

386
00:31:54,905 --> 00:31:55,849
Rym: old is older than me.

387
00:31:56,271 --> 00:31:57,634
Scott: Yeah, so we're.

388
00:31:57,754 --> 00:32:00,060
Scott: I'm gonna be 24 in less than a month.

389
00:32:00,601 --> 00:32:04,050
Scott: So if you're 30 something you're old to me.

390
00:32:04,993 --> 00:32:08,748
Scott: You might be young to my mom who's like 50 something but you're old to me.

391
00:32:08,988 --> 00:32:13,190
Rym: so yeah I think I'm pretty much the line because of the inner group of the front row crew.

392
00:32:13,651 --> 00:32:20,740
Rym: I'm the oldest one of this generation and then I mean we have our friends like Scott Johnson's a little older and Collins like a thousand.

393
00:32:20,761 --> 00:32:22,070
Scott: he's like 10 billion.

394
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:28,167
Scott: But the way I see it, you know if my mom is 50 something she's old and I'm 20 something and I'm young.

395
00:32:28,187 --> 00:32:31,249
Scott: if you're 30 Something you're in the middle middle age.

396
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:36,186
Scott: Anyway, all right that that was a tangent and a tangent of attention.

397
00:32:36,628 --> 00:32:37,090
Scott: Oh my god.

398
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,209
Scott: All right back to the back to the point.

399
00:32:39,771 --> 00:32:46,010
Scott: We did a guest spot on their movies podcast where we talked about a attack the gas station, which is awesome.

400
00:32:46,231 --> 00:32:47,057
Rym: Yes, you should see it.

401
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:47,621
Rym: It's a movie.

402
00:32:47,641 --> 00:32:48,124
Rym: You should see.

403
00:32:48,406 --> 00:32:59,450
Scott: yes attack the gas station is a movie everyone should see especially if you're a geek and If anyone he is here because you know, they listen to movies you should see and they told you to come listen to us.

404
00:32:59,491 --> 00:33:00,169
Scott: Well, that's awesome.

405
00:33:00,961 --> 00:33:03,798
Scott: but Now, you know, we works both ways.

406
00:33:03,818 --> 00:33:06,930
Scott: if you listen to us and you like movies go listen to movies.

407
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:11,524
Scott: You should see if you can go to simply syndicated comm slash movies.

408
00:33:11,564 --> 00:33:13,590
Scott: You should see that HTML plus.

409
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:22,523
Rym: It's very good that we know of these people and they're cool because now we are much less inclined to do our Thursday cop-out Which is if it's Thursday, and we don't want to do a show.

410
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,910
Rym: We'll just talk about a movie we've seen.

411
00:33:24,272 --> 00:33:26,209
Rym: Yeah, now we probably won't do that.

412
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:32,128
Scott: Yep, I mean we were gonna do probably do at some point and attack the gas station episode, but now we don't have to.

413
00:33:32,349 --> 00:33:34,254
Scott: yeah So there you go.

414
00:33:34,495 --> 00:33:38,670
Rym: Plus their commentary was slightly more erudite than what we would say about attack the gas station.

415
00:33:39,011 --> 00:33:48,983
Scott: Yes, but I was surprised they did not know what mise en scene means which is the first thing I learned in the only film Class I've ever taken and they didn't even pronounce it correctly yet.

416
00:33:49,043 --> 00:33:51,250
Scott: They think they should be able to have a movie podcast.

417
00:33:51,671 --> 00:33:53,155
Rym: Oh, you're bringing out the smack talk.

418
00:33:53,175 --> 00:33:58,410
Scott: Well, no, actually they they recognize in their podcast that who are we to have a movie podcast?

419
00:34:00,493 --> 00:34:01,879
Scott: And of course, who are we to have a?

420
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:04,730
Scott: oh wait no, we are professionals at GeekNights, yeah.

421
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:13,130
Scott: So, yes, we are the ones to have a geeky podcast being professional geeks of the highest alpha geek character.

422
00:34:13,434 --> 00:34:15,473
Rym: Yeah, we'll stand by that too If anyone wants to.

423
00:34:15,614 --> 00:34:22,069
Scott: uh, if anyone wants to challenge us to like a geek duel to see you know Who is geekier and more intelligent and all that?

424
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:33,909
Scott: Unless you're like some crazy super geek unless you have a webcomic that gets more than 1 million readers per day Yeah, but then we'll only bow to you in certain areas.

425
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:37,483
Scott: Like if Gabe came up to us, we would only bow to his art geekness.

426
00:34:37,524 --> 00:34:38,969
Scott: We would not bow to anything else.

427
00:34:39,793 --> 00:34:42,145
Rym: His video game geek is something to be feared.

428
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:43,150
Scott: Oh, it is true.

429
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,719
Scott: His video game geek is feared, but I don't know.

430
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:50,159
Scott: It's probably equal to my only does have more hours But he plays a lot of crap games.

431
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,110
Scott: see it comes down to that sort of thing.

432
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:59,561
Scott: Yeah, but we could probably beat 90% of geeks in any geek category not to be you know Full of hubris or anything.

433
00:34:59,581 --> 00:35:14,664
Scott: if we ever have our own Convention the gax if you will Then We will have to have the geek megathon where people will have to challenge us to like ten tests of geek skill And I'm sure they're all losing the board game round.

434
00:35:14,684 --> 00:35:15,328
Scott: So it doesn't matter.

435
00:35:16,671 --> 00:35:19,285
Scott: Anyway, right our episode is on home networking.

436
00:35:20,311 --> 00:35:26,809
Rym: Yeah, if you've listened through all that just because you wanted to get to the home networking part I'm sorry, but it's Monday and Mondays tend to have a lot of cruft.

437
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,413
Scott: Yeah We're gonna.

438
00:35:28,433 --> 00:35:35,349
Scott: basically what we do is we have the cruft on Monday and then we summarize the cruft Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday into smaller bits.

439
00:35:36,214 --> 00:35:37,160
Scott: Sorry Monday guys.

440
00:35:37,623 --> 00:35:45,670
Rym: Yep, but today is home networking day and one because we got the Question in the feedback email and two because it worked today.

441
00:35:46,212 --> 00:35:51,150
Rym: I was asked some fairly mundane questions about home networking by my office mate the cool Korean guy.

442
00:35:51,371 --> 00:35:55,350
Scott: You seem to get that asked quite a bit or at least you say you do well because one.

443
00:35:56,053 --> 00:36:05,147
Rym: While I do system administration and like a lot of Linux and server stuff Where I work at IBM and pretty much all the jobs I've had I went to school for networking.

444
00:36:05,769 --> 00:36:15,009
Rym: I concentrated in like networking Architecture and like high-level awesome cool routing stuff and I've never actually done that for money.

445
00:36:15,634 --> 00:36:17,590
Scott: I was just about to say how often have you used that now?

446
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:26,830
Rym: I mean I I am capable on my own of fully planning out Architecting and wiring like all the way down to pulling the cables if I have to like an entire office building.

447
00:36:27,212 --> 00:36:28,778
Rym: But now I don't do any of that.

448
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:31,790
Rym: I admin frickin Linux servers and databases and crap.

449
00:36:31,891 --> 00:36:39,230
Scott: Yeah, it does seem to be a common question now Like if someone has something wrong with their you know computer or they find out you're a computer guy.

450
00:36:39,732 --> 00:36:43,810
Scott: One of the first things I seem to get asked all the time is I just bought a wireless router.

451
00:36:43,931 --> 00:36:46,209
Scott: How do I make it go or that sort of thing?

452
00:36:46,891 --> 00:36:54,245
Rym: Now I could go on and on about tech support for people who aren't Technological and we're gonna do a whole episode on that someday because I have thousands of anecdotes.

453
00:36:54,707 --> 00:36:55,590
Scott: Oh my god millions.

454
00:36:55,731 --> 00:37:00,090
Rym: The only thing I'll say now is that you don't ask your dentist friend to rip your tooth out at a party.

455
00:37:00,372 --> 00:37:02,269
Rym: Don't ask me to fix your router at a party.

456
00:37:02,552 --> 00:37:05,170
Rym: I'll charge you the same amount the dentist charges exactly.

457
00:37:05,812 --> 00:37:16,242
Rym: But anyway, even though I end up helping people anyway, because it's usually not that difficult and cuz it doesn't require materials like a dentist Usually I've had people ask me to like wire their house.

458
00:37:16,844 --> 00:37:18,730
Rym: Oh and that requires a lot of equipment.

459
00:37:18,993 --> 00:37:20,430
Scott: I just give you two middle fingers, right?

460
00:37:22,558 --> 00:37:34,210
Rym: But home networking Anyone who's considering building home network who has a home network and doesn't know if it's good or it has problems The best thing I can tell you right now is that it's a good time to be alive.

461
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:39,933
Rym: networking unless you need to do something interesting is Incredibly simple.

462
00:37:39,993 --> 00:37:49,090
Scott: nowadays most devices that you buy are literally just plug it in and it works Especially if you got Windows or a Mac and if you have Linux you already smart enough.

463
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:53,687
Rym: You don't need to know about whatever and even if you don't I mean leaving like Ubuntu just freakin works.

464
00:37:53,867 --> 00:37:54,228
Scott: Yeah.

465
00:37:54,349 --> 00:38:03,456
Rym: Yeah Yeah, but I'm gonna talk mostly about the actual infrastructure of a home network, you know cable modem routers wireless Switches and hubs and why?

466
00:38:03,596 --> 00:38:06,566
Rym: one of them is spawn of Satan and one of them is the holiest of Holies.

467
00:38:06,586 --> 00:38:07,870
Scott: the holiest of Holies.

468
00:38:08,792 --> 00:38:10,376
Rym: I really like switches wires.

469
00:38:10,797 --> 00:38:12,762
Rym: Yeah, what kind of wires?

470
00:38:12,822 --> 00:38:19,230
Rym: all the cable II crap network cards because I mean It's really simple to me and people who have studied this sort of thing.

471
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:22,181
Rym: But while it's simple just plug the stuff in and make it work.

472
00:38:22,261 --> 00:38:23,084
Rym: It's not trivial.

473
00:38:23,566 --> 00:38:24,590
Rym: You have to know something.

474
00:38:25,114 --> 00:38:26,828
Rym: So hopefully I can shed some light on this topic.

475
00:38:27,811 --> 00:38:29,839
Rym: Now one I'm gonna assume you have broadband.

476
00:38:30,281 --> 00:38:32,490
Rym: if you don't have broadband you don't have a home network.

477
00:38:32,813 --> 00:38:36,053
Scott: Yeah, if you have dial-up, um What the hell?

478
00:38:36,093 --> 00:38:37,659
Scott: How are you downloading podcasts?

479
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:37,900
Scott: Yeah.

480
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,610
Scott: Wow, you must be really freaking dedicated got them.

481
00:38:41,332 --> 00:38:44,602
Rym: We did have one guy download our podcast dial-up a couple times really.

482
00:38:44,742 --> 00:38:46,488
Rym: Yeah a guy at work who doesn't have broadband.

483
00:38:46,568 --> 00:38:47,190
Scott: Holy shit.

484
00:38:47,311 --> 00:38:51,743
Rym: Yeah, Wow He said he'd ever he'd listen again if we ever got James Randi on the show.

485
00:38:52,326 --> 00:38:58,710
Scott: She'd give him a CD Instead of you know, it's not a bad idea DVD man, whatever.

486
00:38:59,495 --> 00:39:02,110
Rym: Anyway home networking so broadband.

487
00:39:02,511 --> 00:39:08,008
Rym: I'm also not going to talk about the different types of internet connections or broadband because it doesn't matter.

488
00:39:08,088 --> 00:39:10,910
Rym: we could do a whole separate Episode on that and it's actually complicated.

489
00:39:11,312 --> 00:39:18,300
Rym: But you've got some sort of networking some sort of DSL modem or cable modem or something And there's a little cat5 cable that comes out of it.

490
00:39:18,501 --> 00:39:23,729
Scott: a cat5 cable looks like a phone cable But it's bigger and has eight little wires in it.

491
00:39:24,232 --> 00:39:37,762
Rym: Now the only other thing I want to say before I get started is that if you have any sort of USB Network thing if you plug into any networking equipment with a USB cable That's bad and you should probably not do it that way.

492
00:39:37,802 --> 00:39:39,027
Rym: You should listen to me and do it the way.

493
00:39:39,068 --> 00:39:39,630
Rym: I'm about to say

494
00:39:39,982 --> 00:39:54,293
Scott: Yeah If you'll have a cable modem or a DSL or something and it's connected to your computer with a wire That is similar to the one your mouse and your keyboard and your printer and your scanner use and it's not doesn't look like a phone Cable, that's bad.

495
00:39:54,314 --> 00:39:59,929
Rym: I just had this horrible image of someone using like ps2 or AT connections.

496
00:39:59,949 --> 00:40:06,161
Scott: a USB has this little three Simply with an arrow and a god.

497
00:40:06,181 --> 00:40:08,509
Scott: if you don't know what USB is go to Wikipedia and type in USB.

498
00:40:09,011 --> 00:40:09,773
Rym: You know what USB is.

499
00:40:09,793 --> 00:40:10,977
Rym: stop listening to GeekNights.

500
00:40:11,057 --> 00:40:13,044
Scott: Yeah, I mean come on these GeekNights Mondays.

501
00:40:13,184 --> 00:40:17,830
Rym: Yeah, all right, so It's a. I mean I could talk about so much.

502
00:40:17,991 --> 00:40:18,757
Rym: It's so simple.

503
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,255
Rym: quite literally if you have one computer We'll start with that.

504
00:40:21,275 --> 00:40:24,555
Rym: If you have one computer and you wanna hook it up to the internet You have your cable modem.

505
00:40:25,258 --> 00:40:28,550
Rym: now, you're gonna want to plug a network cable a normal network cable.

506
00:40:29,131 --> 00:40:32,010
Rym: Don't worry about any special you just need a normal network cable.

507
00:40:32,111 --> 00:40:33,398
Rym: Anything you buy in the store will work.

508
00:40:33,579 --> 00:40:43,075
Rym: as long as it does not say crossover Mm-hmm You plug it into the hole in there in the cable modem or DSL modem and then you plug it into the uplink hole on Your router.

509
00:40:43,761 --> 00:40:46,093
Rym: if you don't have a router Buy a router.

510
00:40:46,113 --> 00:40:47,017
Rym: if you yeah.

511
00:40:47,037 --> 00:40:48,363
Scott: Well, you should buy a router.

512
00:40:48,463 --> 00:40:55,530
Scott: I recommend the Linksys WRT 54 G. that is probably the best router you can buy for home network.

513
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:57,679
Rym: Yeah, and it's not like we're paid to shill or anything.

514
00:40:57,799 --> 00:40:59,145
Rym: Everyone agrees on the internet.

515
00:40:59,245 --> 00:41:00,510
Rym: It's it's the best router.

516
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:05,908
Scott: It's actually because links is used Linux for the software of the router and it's all open source.

517
00:41:05,948 --> 00:41:07,411
Scott: and there's a million Firmwares.

518
00:41:07,512 --> 00:41:08,675
Scott: and this router is just awesome.

519
00:41:08,715 --> 00:41:09,959
Rym: It's also really cheap.

520
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:10,741
Scott: It's really cheap.

521
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:11,884
Scott: It does everything you need.

522
00:41:12,005 --> 00:41:12,546
Scott: It's perfect.

523
00:41:12,586 --> 00:41:13,850
Scott: They sell it everywhere.

524
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:15,260
Scott: It just get it.

525
00:41:15,683 --> 00:41:16,629
Scott: it's easy it works.

526
00:41:17,292 --> 00:41:19,020
Rym: Alright now you have the router.

527
00:41:19,241 --> 00:41:21,510
Rym: you've bought the cable modem into the uplink port of the router.

528
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:30,609
Rym: It'll say uplink on it and then you plug your PC into one of the other ports on the router doesn't matter which one and Everything will probably just work if it doesn't just work.

529
00:41:31,312 --> 00:41:35,002
Scott: Your links is router comes to directions read those directions and do what they say.

530
00:41:35,143 --> 00:41:37,590
Scott: usually involves putting in a CD and pushing two buttons.

531
00:41:38,064 --> 00:41:47,570
Rym: Yep Now what I'm gonna keep doing is I'm gonna explain just kind of describe all the different Setups and then I'll go and explain what each of the things is and how it works on a very broad level.

532
00:41:48,613 --> 00:41:55,669
Rym: Now if you say you have two computers This is when it gets a little tricky because at this point you're going to need something else.

533
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:59,708
Rym: now You can just plug two computers into the router and that'll work fine.

534
00:42:00,353 --> 00:42:07,989
Rym: however, the router Has a switch in it if you use a normal router just because that makes things easier.

535
00:42:08,832 --> 00:42:14,934
Rym: However, the switch is usually using logic in the router or it's somehow Taxing the router.

536
00:42:14,954 --> 00:42:18,810
Rym: you're basically putting more stress on the router and as a result your connection might be a little slower.

537
00:42:19,691 --> 00:42:21,499
Rym: But if you don't care, it doesn't matter.

538
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:24,110
Rym: you can plug as many computers into your router as it has holes.

539
00:42:24,532 --> 00:42:28,810
Scott: Yeah, well except of course for the one hole that goes to the cable modem or DSL modem.

540
00:42:28,981 --> 00:42:37,939
Scott: Yep The thing is is it won't make it that much slower unless you plan on having everyone do something Bit torrent at the same time.

541
00:42:37,959 --> 00:42:39,165
Scott: It's not gonna hurt you.

542
00:42:39,567 --> 00:42:40,190
Rym: Don't worry about it.

543
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:43,450
Rym: Now if you have a bunch of computers in your house, you're gonna want some switches.

544
00:42:44,391 --> 00:42:46,379
Rym: Now the setup here is very simple.

545
00:42:46,419 --> 00:42:48,909
Rym: again cable modem to your router.

546
00:42:49,652 --> 00:42:54,150
Rym: Then one cable from your router to the switch in the uplink part of the switch.

547
00:42:54,732 --> 00:42:56,640
Scott: So in the you have the.

548
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,890
Scott: the kid modem still goes to the uplink on the router.

549
00:42:59,271 --> 00:43:08,330
Scott: but then you take a cable from any of the normal computer holes on the router to the uplink on the switch and then Plug every computer you have into all the other ports on that switch.

550
00:43:08,591 --> 00:43:14,910
Rym: Mm-hmm, if you have too many computers plug another switch into that switch or plug another switch into the router.

551
00:43:15,091 --> 00:43:22,493
Rym: Yep, the key here is that you can basically just keep expanding your network as much as you want as long as you use switches Mm-hmm.

552
00:43:22,894 --> 00:43:30,478
Rym: Not many people sell hubs anymore, but don't buy a hub make sure it says the word 10 100. it might say a thousand switch.

553
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,666
Rym: you also wanted to say full duplex.

554
00:43:33,167 --> 00:43:34,870
Rym: if you buy a link sis You can't go wrong.

555
00:43:36,032 --> 00:43:38,930
Rym: In fact, I would recommend buying link sis for everything in your house.

556
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:41,490
Rym: They pretty much make the best home networking equipment at the best price.

557
00:43:41,711 --> 00:43:46,248
Scott: Yeah, I mean sometimes you can get a cheap net gear thing, but that's like big and metal and it.

558
00:43:46,409 --> 00:43:49,250
Scott: you know It can scratch furniture and whatever.

559
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:51,356
Rym: But what I just said, that's it.

560
00:43:51,457 --> 00:43:53,406
Rym: That's basically all you have to do to have a home network.

561
00:43:53,989 --> 00:43:55,817
Rym: now You might wonder well, right?

562
00:43:55,857 --> 00:43:57,705
Rym: Why are you gonna talk about it or rib?

563
00:43:57,785 --> 00:43:58,689
Rym: My network doesn't work.

564
00:43:59,335 --> 00:44:00,385
Rym: Here's where the fun parts come in.

565
00:44:01,191 --> 00:44:03,200
Rym: Now a router the links.

566
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:10,050
Rym: this router that you've got between you and the cable modem Does a lot of things you might not realize and you might have to set some of these up again.

567
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:11,816
Rym: There are instructions that came with your router.

568
00:44:11,877 --> 00:44:12,800
Rym: It's very simple to do.

569
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,370
Rym: I'm not going to explain the commands you type or whatever.

570
00:44:16,471 --> 00:44:19,358
Rym: What the router does is you get an IP address?

571
00:44:19,499 --> 00:44:23,950
Rym: I assume you know what an IP address is from your internet provider.

572
00:44:24,853 --> 00:44:30,084
Rym: They give it to you via a protocol called DHCP dynamic host configuration protocol.

573
00:44:30,526 --> 00:44:37,247
Rym: usually yeah 99% of the time again your ISP will also give you instructions as to how you'll get your IP address.

574
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:38,170
Rym: follow their instructions.

575
00:44:38,572 --> 00:44:42,210
Rym: Yep, now you'll get an IP address and that is your IP to the world.

576
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:43,155
Rym: That is your address.

577
00:44:43,215 --> 00:44:47,936
Rym: as far as the internet is concerned when you talk to someone else It goes from that IP address.

578
00:44:48,217 --> 00:44:53,015
Rym: when someone talks to you if they ever dial in that IP address It goes to your computer.

579
00:44:53,497 --> 00:44:59,220
Scott: if you have five computers as far as the Internet's concerned All those five computers are sharing that one IP it.

580
00:44:59,240 --> 00:44:59,341
Scott: Well.

581
00:44:59,381 --> 00:45:02,836
Rym: I'm getting to that because as far as the internet concern is concerned There's only one computer.

582
00:45:02,856 --> 00:45:03,741
Rym: There's no sharing.

583
00:45:03,802 --> 00:45:04,224
Rym: That's true.

584
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,110
Rym: now That's fine.

585
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:12,230
Rym: If you have one computer now if you have two computers And you want them both to be on the internet at the same time that's not going to work.

586
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:20,280
Rym: You only have one IP address and until recently your only option was to buy another IP address From your internet service provider.

587
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,244
Scott: that sucked ass.

588
00:45:21,264 --> 00:45:27,022
Rym: you can still do it actually yep And sometimes it's useful but it usually cost quite a bit of money and it sucks ass.

589
00:45:27,162 --> 00:45:35,165
Rym: and then you needed a switch or something so you could all plug into the cable modem and Depending if you know that you need an IP address for something then you know about.

590
00:45:35,185 --> 00:45:36,390
Rym: don't bother listening to the rest of this.

591
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:41,341
Rym: you Know what you're doing, but if you have no idea what I'm talking about right now It's good to be alive.

592
00:45:41,361 --> 00:45:54,120
Rym: like I said before Nowadays instead of having to buy one IP address for every computer you have you buy the router that Scott just mentioned and you plug it in just like I said and The router will do something called network address translation or net.

593
00:45:54,862 --> 00:46:02,042
Rym: now technically what it does is port address translation But I've never talked to an actual network professional who uses those terms.

594
00:46:02,183 --> 00:46:03,747
Rym: they use net to mean everything.

595
00:46:03,948 --> 00:46:04,469
Scott: it has Pat.

596
00:46:07,073 --> 00:46:08,360
Scott: Way to go Pat now.

597
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:16,007
Rym: basically what it does is Computers have ports on IP addresses, so you connect to a website.

598
00:46:16,047 --> 00:46:18,274
Rym: You know you type in www.whatever.com.

599
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:32,090
Rym: the DNS resolves that name to a IP number an IP address and then you connect to that computer on Port 80 because Port 80 is the port that everyone agreed is where web pages will come from and There's a different port for every protocol.

600
00:46:32,551 --> 00:46:39,188
Rym: And then there's thousands and thousands and thousands of high or they're called ephemeral ports that you just use whenever you need to use a port for something.

601
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:45,330
Rym: Anytime you ever connect to another computer you do it on one of their ports from one of your ports.

602
00:46:46,632 --> 00:46:50,950
Rym: Now this is very handy that there's so many of them because you only have one IP address to the outside world.

603
00:46:51,473 --> 00:46:55,514
Rym: But that IP address has a whole bunch of ports 65,000 something.

604
00:46:55,534 --> 00:46:57,251
Scott: yeah, yeah 65,535.

605
00:46:57,251 --> 00:47:01,890
Rym: give or take Unsigned integer yeah.

606
00:47:03,031 --> 00:47:07,443
Rym: Now what it'll do and I'm gonna explain this as non technically as I can.

607
00:47:08,105 --> 00:47:11,875
Rym: you have you have your IP address to the Internet Inside of your network.

608
00:47:12,216 --> 00:47:15,990
Rym: all of your computers have other IP addresses that usually your router will just give to you.

609
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:21,504
Rym: You don't have to worry about it Because basically you can set your router up to do the DHCP thing that I said earlier.

610
00:47:21,785 --> 00:47:23,130
Rym: read the instructions for your router.

611
00:47:24,012 --> 00:47:26,330
Rym: So you'll have for say you have four computers.

612
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:33,710
Rym: You'll have four IP addresses that are internal to your network using special IP addresses that only exist inside of little networks like yours.

613
00:47:35,211 --> 00:47:38,430
Rym: These addresses are special in that they're not routable on the Internet.

614
00:47:38,951 --> 00:47:42,962
Rym: Nothing on the Internet can ever route these special IP numbers.

615
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:45,669
Rym: so your network is basically completely on its own.

616
00:47:46,492 --> 00:47:53,629
Rym: now say 10 dot 10 dot 10 dot 10 dot 1 is the IP address of your first computer and You want to connect to slash dot?

617
00:47:54,551 --> 00:47:55,435
Rym: So you're the right.

618
00:47:55,455 --> 00:48:02,728
Rym: it'll go to the router and the router will perform a translation on it And it'll so say it comes out of port a thousand on your computer.

619
00:48:02,768 --> 00:48:06,006
Rym: your computer Just picks that port and it connects to the net.

620
00:48:06,046 --> 00:48:06,770
Rym: it goes to the router.

621
00:48:07,291 --> 00:48:14,032
Rym: The router will say all right ten dot ten dot ten dot one wants to connect to slash dot on port 80.

622
00:48:14,032 --> 00:48:18,630
Rym: I will send this thing to slash dot on port 80 from me from my port.

623
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:28,517
Rym: Now every time something comes back to the router from the outside internet on port 9,000 it knows all right.

624
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:35,909
Rym: anything coming on port 9,000 is supposed to go back to computer ten dot ten dot ten dot one Because he's the one I gave that port to.

625
00:48:37,175 --> 00:48:38,109
Rym: I hope that made sense.

626
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:41,999
Rym: basically, it'll divvy up ports and it'll take.

627
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:49,729
Rym: it'll basically take care of the traffic that's going in and out and it'll on its Own know which of your computers the traffic from the outside needs to go to.

628
00:48:50,251 --> 00:48:53,282
Rym: That way all of your computers can share one IP address on the internet.

629
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:55,309
Rym: Yep, every router does this.

630
00:48:56,193 --> 00:49:03,222
Scott: I don't know, but if you decide that you want to have 70,000 computers on your network all visit a web page at the same time.

631
00:49:03,904 --> 00:49:05,710
Scott: You're not going to do with that little router.

632
00:49:06,452 --> 00:49:08,990
Rym: Yeah, well if you've got that many you really need some Cisco hardware.

633
00:49:09,151 --> 00:49:11,358
Rym: Yeah, you need something else even though our link.

634
00:49:11,378 --> 00:49:14,088
Scott: This is Cisco links is technically is Cisco.

635
00:49:14,128 --> 00:49:29,481
Rym: That is correct Yep, so when I say Cisco hardware, I mean routers bigger than my computer exactly now net I mean almost all of you out there are probably using net and there are a lot of Problems that people have with the internet that they don't realize.

636
00:49:29,762 --> 00:49:33,785
Rym: like they'll wonder why bit torrent is slow on their computer but it's fine for all their friends.

637
00:49:33,805 --> 00:49:41,240
Rym: or If I'm playing a game on half like a half-life game on Steam How come John in the other room can't connect?

638
00:49:41,421 --> 00:49:44,029
Rym: but as soon as I disconnect he can stuff like that.

639
00:49:44,992 --> 00:49:48,290
Rym: And it all comes down to the fact that port address translation is not perfect.

640
00:49:48,912 --> 00:50:00,043
Rym: the main thing is if a request comes in if someone tries to connect to you and There's not a connection already established by the net in the router The router doesn't know what to do with that packet.

641
00:50:00,084 --> 00:50:00,667
Rym: So it drops it.

642
00:50:01,432 --> 00:50:15,930
Rym: So if you're running a game or something like bit torrents a good example Your bit torrent needs to be able to receive connections from the outside world Meaning a random person will connect to your IP address on a certain port and say hey, I'm here to do some bit torrent with you.

643
00:50:16,352 --> 00:50:23,965
Rym: I'm gonna give you some files and seed woohoo now Because you don't know that guy's gonna connect to you and you haven't connected to him before it comes in.

644
00:50:24,086 --> 00:50:31,126
Rym: on whatever port you've got Set up for bit torrent and Your router doesn't know who that port belongs to which your for computer should he send it to?

645
00:50:31,186 --> 00:50:32,150
Rym: he can't send it to everyone.

646
00:50:32,211 --> 00:50:32,836
Rym: That's dangerous.

647
00:50:33,098 --> 00:50:33,804
Rym: So he just drops it.

648
00:50:34,268 --> 00:50:42,103
Rym: Yep So if you've ever if you have bit torrent and I know a lot of people use a serious I'll use that as an example and you only get the yellow smiley faces.

649
00:50:42,324 --> 00:50:43,870
Rym: You never get the green smiley face ever.

650
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:45,229
Rym: That's your problem.

651
00:50:45,651 --> 00:50:53,292
Rym: it means that you can still use bit torrent but you can't ever get an unsolicited connection from someone else to you and The way around.

652
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:56,486
Rym: this is called port forwarding or port tunneling.

653
00:50:57,410 --> 00:51:00,470
Rym: I Can't really tell you how to do it because it's another thing.

654
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:03,304
Rym: You'll have to read the manual for your router or search on the internet.

655
00:51:03,706 --> 00:51:04,450
Rym: It's very simple.

656
00:51:05,092 --> 00:51:06,997
Rym: All it does is you'll be able to specify.

657
00:51:07,017 --> 00:51:15,170
Rym: Hey anything that comes in on port whatever to the router Automatically goes to that same port on whatever computer I specify.

658
00:51:15,792 --> 00:51:22,571
Scott: So in other words, let's say I want to run a game server and the game server runs on port 6969.

659
00:51:22,571 --> 00:51:32,350
Scott: I tell the router hey if anyone comes around to this router and they want to talk to port 6969 You tell them to go to that computer over there because that is the game server.

660
00:51:32,751 --> 00:51:37,124
Scott: Yeah, the problem with this is if another computer wants to use port 6969.

661
00:51:37,124 --> 00:51:38,529
Scott: Well, you can't do that.

662
00:51:38,569 --> 00:51:38,810
Scott: Really?

663
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:45,950
Rym: Yep Now it I want to get into the details of that because technically it could but not it's really complicated.

664
00:51:46,031 --> 00:51:47,849
Scott: That's the part you don't need to know.

665
00:51:47,978 --> 00:51:56,427
Scott: Yeah That's the part I need to know because I'm the one who sets all this crap up for you'll never have that problem if you Ever run two game servers put one on six nine six nine and one on six nine seven.

666
00:51:56,547 --> 00:52:00,382
Scott: Oh, yep You'll be just fine now 65,000 to choose from.

667
00:52:00,422 --> 00:52:01,168
Scott: you can't go wrong.

668
00:52:02,611 --> 00:52:11,390
Rym: Now the best advice I can give right here in terms of problems with Nat and Pat and all that sort of thing is that Here's a list of the applications that tend to be affected by this sort of thing.

669
00:52:11,832 --> 00:52:20,970
Rym: So if you have if you're running something like this and you have trouble Involving connecting to people or getting connections or slow connections or what have you it's probably a nat issue.

670
00:52:21,351 --> 00:52:24,786
Rym: Google around on port forwarding and port tunneling and fig and then you'll be able to fix it.

671
00:52:25,669 --> 00:52:37,870
Rym: a lot of voice over IP stuff like Skype bit torrent II things any sort of peer-to-peer application Instant messenger file transfers tend to be hit by this a lot.

672
00:52:38,131 --> 00:52:42,027
Rym: Oh, yeah certain kinds of FTP servers actually get hit by this.

673
00:52:43,292 --> 00:52:46,123
Rym: Yeah, I don't know how many of you know, but FTP everyone uses FTP right.

674
00:52:46,665 --> 00:52:50,099
Rym: there's two kinds of FTP Passive mode and active mode.

675
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:55,218
Rym: I'm not even gonna explain the differences But sometimes FTP doesn't work.

676
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:59,110
Rym: And if it doesn't a firewall or a net is probably the reason.

677
00:52:59,691 --> 00:53:06,348
Rym: Mm-hmm and games game servers and even a lot of game clients steam in particular has a lot of trouble with ports.

678
00:53:06,689 --> 00:53:12,870
Scott: anything that Any program where it's like you don't really know what port stuff is using.

679
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:19,664
Scott: but if there's a program that says I use port this number or You know, which port number do you want to use?

680
00:53:19,684 --> 00:53:20,870
Scott: because it asks you for a number?

681
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:23,859
Scott: Those are the programs to watch out for other programs.

682
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:25,965
Scott: They don't really care what port they use.

683
00:53:26,005 --> 00:53:26,627
Scott: They'll just do it.

684
00:53:27,169 --> 00:53:31,239
Rym: Yep, and Generally, it's programs that in any way act as a server.

685
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:39,250
Rym: any program that wants someone else to be able to connect to you Unsolicited from the outside needs some sort of tunnel through the net to work.

686
00:53:39,531 --> 00:53:43,968
Scott: Yep, so with a net you can go to every computer out on the internet and say hey, what's doing?

687
00:53:43,988 --> 00:53:44,430
Scott: Hey, what's doing?

688
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:45,032
Scott: Hey, what's doing?

689
00:53:45,233 --> 00:53:49,070
Scott: But if anyone wants to come to you and say hey, how you guys doing over here?

690
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:50,949
Scott: That's when the net gets in the way.

691
00:53:51,371 --> 00:53:58,140
Scott: so if you want people on the internet to be able to come over to you and talk to you without you going and Inviting them or talking to them first.

692
00:53:58,422 --> 00:53:59,769
Scott: That's where the net gets in the way.

693
00:54:00,171 --> 00:54:05,430
Rym: Yep, if anything else if you know, you have a problem like this find some geek and say hey I'm having trouble with my net.

694
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:10,370
Rym: That way he'll probably be able to help you instead of saying hey my game server doesn't work.

695
00:54:10,511 --> 00:54:12,260
Scott: Then they really don't know what your talk could be.

696
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:12,864
Scott: You're just stupid.

697
00:54:12,884 --> 00:54:14,010
Scott: You don't set up a game server.

698
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:21,853
Rym: Yeah, plus as a geek I will say that the more effort and due diligence a person puts in before they come to me for help the more likely I Am to help them.

699
00:54:22,275 --> 00:54:22,797
Rym: Mm-hmm.

700
00:54:22,958 --> 00:54:25,510
Rym: Like if someone says my internets down, I'll punch them.

701
00:54:25,932 --> 00:54:29,470
Rym: But if someone says my internets down I tried rebooting my router.

702
00:54:29,852 --> 00:54:31,980
Rym: I tried unplugging everything and plugging it back in.

703
00:54:32,262 --> 00:54:35,818
Rym: I tried doing that IP release renew thing You told me about and it still doesn't work.

704
00:54:36,341 --> 00:54:37,326
Rym: Then I'll probably help.

705
00:54:37,969 --> 00:54:40,615
Scott: Yep One more cool thing.

706
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:44,270
Scott: I've talked a lot about hamachi all over the place.

707
00:54:44,753 --> 00:54:47,592
Scott: I'm probably a good place to tell people what hamachi does Yep.

708
00:54:47,873 --> 00:54:52,350
Rym: Now one if you're using Linux you might have you have to do some kernel things to get it working sometimes.

709
00:54:52,511 --> 00:54:59,279
Scott: So yeah, if you don't have the tunnel kernel module, whatever but ignore that I'm not only gonna talk about it on the home networking level.

710
00:54:59,601 --> 00:55:00,243
Rym: Yeah, not windows.

711
00:55:00,324 --> 00:55:01,388
Rym: It's so trivial to use.

712
00:55:01,448 --> 00:55:01,870
Rym: I could cry.

713
00:55:02,131 --> 00:55:05,603
Scott: Yes, so there's a thing called a virtual private network a VPN.

714
00:55:05,724 --> 00:55:06,727
Scott: people have talked about it.

715
00:55:06,787 --> 00:55:07,389
Scott: you might have heard it.

716
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:10,500
Rym: Yep, your router might actually have stuff to do it built in.

717
00:55:10,841 --> 00:55:11,403
Scott: or your writer.

718
00:55:11,544 --> 00:55:16,489
Scott: your routers usually don't have stuff to do it But what they usually have is a thing that allows it to happen.

719
00:55:16,751 --> 00:55:19,620
Scott: Yeah, you have the other tools that make it go.

720
00:55:19,821 --> 00:55:21,727
Rym: you can even buy special VPN boxes.

721
00:55:21,767 --> 00:55:22,610
Rym: That'll do it all for you.

722
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:24,420
Scott: You can buy hardware things that do it.

723
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,190
Scott: You can buy all kinds of software that does it.

724
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:27,294
Scott: There are a million ways to do it.

725
00:55:27,314 --> 00:55:30,346
Scott: But hamachi I say is the best way because it is free and perfect.

726
00:55:30,888 --> 00:55:32,638
Rym: now anyway Well, remember how I said that.

727
00:55:32,719 --> 00:55:34,370
Rym: would you have your private network behind the net?

728
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:39,230
Rym: You have your own special IP addresses that no one else can see and they're secret and not routable.

729
00:55:40,251 --> 00:55:49,020
Rym: This basically lets you even if you're out on the internet connect to your little private numbered Network all by itself as though you were there physically.

730
00:55:49,321 --> 00:55:50,746
Scott: So here's an example in our house.

731
00:55:50,766 --> 00:55:51,810
Scott: I have a web server.

732
00:55:52,473 --> 00:55:53,820
Scott: You can't visit this web server.

733
00:55:54,001 --> 00:55:55,850
Scott: It has web pages on it, but you can't visit it.

734
00:55:56,011 --> 00:55:58,592
Rym: In fact, it has prototypes of GeekNights it does.

735
00:55:58,612 --> 00:56:05,442
Scott: if you were to find out the IP address of our cable modem and Visit it with your web browser.

736
00:56:05,483 --> 00:56:15,336
Scott: You would get nothing because the web server is hidden behind the network and you're coming around asking for stuff and We didn't forward the port.

737
00:56:15,958 --> 00:56:24,069
Scott: if I forwarded the port and I said hey router if anyone comes looking on port 80 Send them to the web server on port 80 then you would be able to see what was going on.

738
00:56:24,711 --> 00:56:29,710
Scott: Now if you use hamachi, this is really cool or any other VPN if you can get one to work.

739
00:56:29,811 --> 00:56:31,409
Scott: But hamachi I already said is the best.

740
00:56:32,132 --> 00:56:37,990
Scott: What it does is there's some hamachi server out on the internet somewhere and you say hey hamachi server blah blah blah.

741
00:56:38,491 --> 00:56:40,217
Scott: It talks a bunch of mystic crap.

742
00:56:40,277 --> 00:56:42,023
Scott: It's all magic that we don't understand.

743
00:56:42,063 --> 00:56:42,645
Scott: We don't care.

744
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:43,247
Scott: Yeah, you don't care.

745
00:56:44,131 --> 00:56:45,450
Rym: Yeah, we understand it mostly.

746
00:56:45,721 --> 00:56:45,805
Rym: Yeah.

747
00:56:46,431 --> 00:56:58,016
Scott: And what happens is you turn hamachi on and all of a sudden like magic your computer is now somehow Not really, but essentially Inside our network.

748
00:56:58,278 --> 00:57:00,790
Scott: It's as if you plug your computer into our router.

749
00:57:01,031 --> 00:57:04,810
Scott: But no you're far away on the other side of the world and don't be scared by hamachi.

750
00:57:05,071 --> 00:57:12,774
Rym: It's really really really simple to use and as far as we can tell and as far as a lot of experts can tell it's Really really really secure.

751
00:57:12,794 --> 00:57:13,335
Rym: Yep.

752
00:57:13,737 --> 00:57:18,250
Scott: The only problem with it is is now you're exposing all your ports to our network.

753
00:57:18,371 --> 00:57:25,949
Rym: So if you come on to our network with you know through hamachi Then it's just like your computers in the next room and I could do all sorts of things to you.

754
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:32,441
Scott: So you want to be nice and tight before you hamachi with some strange people and if you're gonna use hamachi So you can get into your own.

755
00:57:32,481 --> 00:57:33,389
Scott: that's what I use it for.

756
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:40,394
Scott: So when I'm out and about the world I can get into the home network and do things on all the computers in the house From far away.

757
00:57:40,414 --> 00:57:45,429
Scott: if you were gonna do that make sure that you know Your computer is in your house.

758
00:57:45,751 --> 00:57:51,310
Scott: If anyone accidentally busts into your hamachi and comes inside your house you they don't have much to do.

759
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:52,253
Rym: Yep.

760
00:57:52,695 --> 00:57:54,882
Rym: Now there are software solutions to this too.

761
00:57:55,023 --> 00:58:03,228
Rym: I mean this is hamachi is a software solution Yeah, but I mean there are other like direct software solutions of take control of a computer screen scraper type things.

762
00:58:03,749 --> 00:58:12,803
Rym: Yeah Yeah, yeah VNC was popular VNC PC anywhere, but yeah We're not really gonna talk about those because hamachi in my opinion makes most of them obsolete.

763
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:13,546
Scott: Yep.

764
00:58:13,566 --> 00:58:22,724
Scott: I mean if you use hamachi Linux and xdmcp or hamachi and windows remote desktop I don't think anyone who's still listening know what knows what that is.

765
00:58:23,106 --> 00:58:24,010
Scott: windows remote desktop.

766
00:58:25,054 --> 00:58:28,191
Rym: No, the other one Xdmcp.

767
00:58:28,774 --> 00:58:30,099
Scott: anyone who uses Linux knows it.

768
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:32,670
Rym: Yeah, anyone who uses Linux probably isn't still listening to this episode.

769
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:36,260
Scott: Yeah, but the people use windows using remote desktop and terminal services.

770
00:58:36,641 --> 00:58:38,687
Scott: use those combined with hamachi and you're set.

771
00:58:39,028 --> 00:58:51,206
Rym: Yep Now in terms of the home network and we talked about how to get to your network from the outside and about kind of how It works and the troubles Wired and wireless and moving the wires around is probably the last big thing.

772
00:58:51,286 --> 00:58:52,250
Scott: Oh, we gotta talk about wireless.

773
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:55,250
Rym: Yeah, because anything else you can just read your manual.

774
00:58:55,571 --> 00:58:57,900
Rym: I mean seriously most of the information that I didn't say.

775
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:01,350
Rym: I didn't say it because it's right there in the frickin manual for whatever You just bought.

776
00:59:02,336 --> 00:59:07,292
Rym: now There are crossover cables and there are straight through cables on Networking.

777
00:59:07,673 --> 00:59:17,849
Rym: if you can find any geek near you to make the cables for you ask them to and pay whatever they ask you to Pay because network cables literally cost me about two cents a yard to make.

778
00:59:18,491 --> 00:59:20,757
Scott: Network cables at Staples are a ripoff.

779
00:59:20,838 --> 00:59:31,269
Scott: network cables at Home Depot are great because what you do at Home Depot is you buy like a Mile of network cable in a giant spool and then you put the little plastic caps on the end of it and you cut it.

780
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:41,905
Scott: In fact if you don't have the skill or the tools to cut it and put the plastic bits on the ends of the cables Properly then you need someone else to do and the tools are actually kind of expensive.

781
00:59:41,945 --> 00:59:45,287
Scott: if you want ones that work Yeah, but once you get one tool, you don't need any more.

782
00:59:45,307 --> 00:59:45,367
Scott: Yep

783
00:59:46,032 --> 01:00:01,389
Rym: now there's actually a funny story about that because I bought a giant like thousand foot spool of network cable back at RIT and I stuck it under my desk and One day I was sitting on slash dot and Scott was sitting next to me on his computer on slash dot and the new poll Appeared and it was how much cable is under your desk?

784
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:06,665
Rym: I remember that now they obviously meant like all the cables connecting all your crap together.

785
01:00:07,026 --> 01:00:08,952
Rym: and I'm sitting there and I'm thinking and I I'm like.

786
01:00:09,394 --> 01:00:13,308
Rym: I got about 10 15 meters of cable and I said this out loud.

787
01:00:13,328 --> 01:00:13,830
Rym: Scott looks at me.

788
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:15,054
Rym: He's like a Rym.

789
01:00:15,495 --> 01:00:19,767
Rym: look at your feet and I look down and my feet are resting on this thousand foot spool of cable.

790
01:00:20,309 --> 01:00:22,655
Scott: Yep I still have it.

791
01:00:22,856 --> 01:00:23,700
Scott: We haven't used it all yet.

792
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:24,303
Scott: Have we?

793
01:00:24,343 --> 01:00:25,528
Rym: we're down to the last like 50 feet.

794
01:00:26,671 --> 01:00:27,557
Rym: I'm gonna buy another one.

795
01:00:28,282 --> 01:00:31,454
Rym: All right now Get the cable.

796
01:00:31,474 --> 01:00:31,715
Rym: somehow.

797
01:00:31,735 --> 01:00:33,001
Rym: if you get a geek to make him make him.

798
01:00:33,322 --> 01:00:36,982
Rym: if you want to learn how to make them yourself It's pretty easy to do so on the internet.

799
01:00:37,042 --> 01:00:38,410
Rym: I'm not going to explain it here.

800
01:00:38,511 --> 01:00:39,381
Rym: Maybe I'll show someone.

801
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:46,654
Scott: if we ever do a video Google and type in how to make cat5 had a crimp cat5 cable how to make network cables You'll find it pretty easily.

802
01:00:46,895 --> 01:00:48,581
Scott: You just have to remember the order of the colors.

803
01:00:48,601 --> 01:00:49,344
Scott: That's the tricky part.

804
01:00:49,645 --> 01:00:49,805
Rym: Yep.

805
01:00:49,946 --> 01:01:00,598
Rym: It's Green green and white red red and white orange brown brown bottom fucking now white and orange orange white and green blue white and Blue green white and brown brown.

806
01:01:00,659 --> 01:01:01,182
Scott: Yeah that one.

807
01:01:01,383 --> 01:01:02,430
Rym: That's the B one.

808
01:01:02,571 --> 01:01:05,080
Scott: I knew it was green and white and brown and shit.

809
01:01:05,261 --> 01:01:05,521
Rym: Yeah.

810
01:01:05,682 --> 01:01:07,810
Rym: All right, which which colors are used and which ones aren't?

811
01:01:08,772 --> 01:01:09,421
Scott: Every other one.

812
01:01:09,442 --> 01:01:13,881
Rym: now Orange white and orange green white and green are used.

813
01:01:14,001 --> 01:01:16,210
Rym: Nothing else is used in a standard Ethernet.

814
01:01:16,471 --> 01:01:24,799
Rym: Well power over Ethernet the others get you some yeah or in like the old way to do gigabit over cat3 and all sorts of crazy, yeah, they're just a.

815
01:01:24,819 --> 01:01:27,068
Scott: here's a geeky fact that you may not know.

816
01:01:27,088 --> 01:01:29,348
Scott: a Network cable has eight wires in it.

817
01:01:29,691 --> 01:01:34,890
Rym: Only four of them are actually used and each wire is not actually a wire used on itself.

818
01:01:35,031 --> 01:01:37,789
Rym: It's a wire that is used in pair with another wire.

819
01:01:38,251 --> 01:01:43,749
Scott: so instead of the uses two wires to make one base of its magic and for the wires aren't used at all.

820
01:01:43,769 --> 01:01:47,803
Rym: and Well except in special circumstances that you'll never run into.

821
01:01:47,923 --> 01:01:49,610
Scott: for now at least you'll never run into.

822
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:52,827
Scott: However, if someone gives you a network cable and only has four wires in it.

823
01:01:52,888 --> 01:01:58,090
Rym: Don't worry However, it is mandated by the standard that all eight wires be there for various reasons.

824
01:01:58,532 --> 01:02:02,890
Rym: So if you get a cable that only has four in it, that means whoever made it skimped their ass off.

825
01:02:03,291 --> 01:02:05,300
Scott: Yeah, and you should probably just you know use it.

826
01:02:05,441 --> 01:02:07,470
Scott: It'll work but replace it when you have time.

827
01:02:07,591 --> 01:02:10,650
Rym: Yeah, cuz that means it's a cheap cable keeps super cheap crap.

828
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:15,070
Rym: Now when it comes to buying cable one regardless you want straight through cables.

829
01:02:15,744 --> 01:02:19,698
Rym: No normal person will ever Actually need a crossover cable.

830
01:02:19,918 --> 01:02:19,959
Rym: a

831
01:02:19,999 --> 01:02:25,198
Scott: crossover cable is like if you want to plug two computers together Directly and do something stupid or

832
01:02:25,239 --> 01:02:36,730
Rym: if you want to plug a computer directly to the Ethernet adapter on a real giant like in the closet router Mm-hmm because the rotten I mean the router that a router is basically a computer.

833
01:02:37,354 --> 01:02:41,650
Rym: So if you want to connect to a router directly you have to use a crossover cable In fact, if you want to be really cool.

834
01:02:41,871 --> 01:02:42,815
Scott: You don't need to buy a router.

835
01:02:42,895 --> 01:02:46,510
Scott: just buy a computer and put a bunch of network cards in it and then Linux on it.

836
01:02:46,610 --> 01:02:49,280
Rym: Even if I mean IP changed IP tables, I could do a whole episode.

837
01:02:49,361 --> 01:02:49,802
Rym: how to set that?

838
01:02:49,842 --> 01:02:50,063
Scott: is it?

839
01:02:50,103 --> 01:02:53,472
Scott: there's a Linux distribution called IP cop.

840
01:02:53,673 --> 01:02:57,064
Scott: Yeah, you install that it turns your computer into a router slash firewall.

841
01:02:57,084 --> 01:02:57,927
Rym: It's really good.

842
01:02:57,947 --> 01:02:58,930
Scott: It's really good.

843
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:04,010
Scott: It's really easy, but you have to know about networking to make use of it and you have to sacrifice an entire computer.

844
01:03:04,473 --> 01:03:06,970
Scott: Yeah, and you have to have a whole bunch of network cards in that computer.

845
01:03:07,652 --> 01:03:15,769
Rym: But basically the routers that you buy from Linksys actually have a switch in them and then the routers like inside and you never Connect directly to the router.

846
01:03:16,732 --> 01:03:19,290
Rym: So you don't need a crossover cable in that situation.

847
01:03:19,732 --> 01:03:23,310
Rym: In fact, like I said, you'll never need a crossover cable unless you connect two computers together.

848
01:03:23,731 --> 01:03:25,677
Rym: All the other situations are things you'll never run into.

849
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:28,004
Rym: so you want straight through to.

850
01:03:28,084 --> 01:03:33,883
Rym: you want category five type E cat 5e cat 6 cat 7 cat 8.

851
01:03:33,883 --> 01:03:34,646
Scott: some of them are real.

852
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:35,468
Scott: some of them are fake.

853
01:03:35,529 --> 01:03:35,930
Scott: ignore them.

854
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:36,884
Scott: They're trying to get your money.

855
01:03:37,108 --> 01:03:40,041
Rym: Yeah I mean if the if the cost is the same or almost the same.

856
01:03:40,061 --> 01:03:44,070
Rym: you might as well get cat 6 because it'll run gigabit more reliably.

857
01:03:45,171 --> 01:03:50,310
Rym: But you're probably not even gonna run gigabit to begin with because basically there's cat 3 and there's cat 5.

858
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:51,534
Rym: Those are the two standards.

859
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:53,259
Rym: right now cat 3 is obsolete.

860
01:03:53,781 --> 01:04:02,448
Rym: There are two speeds that are used commonly in Ethernet 10 base T and 100 base T. the standard is rapidly becoming 100 base.

861
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:05,687
Rym: You need at least cat 5 to run 100 base.

862
01:04:06,571 --> 01:04:09,303
Rym: You do not need more than cat 5 to run 100 base.

863
01:04:09,625 --> 01:04:12,817
Scott: if you have cat a billion It'll still run at a hundred.

864
01:04:12,898 --> 01:04:13,962
Scott: It won't go any faster.

865
01:04:13,982 --> 01:04:22,749
Rym: Yep, and while gigabit, you know 1000 base T is coming out and it's becoming more and more accepted If you don't know you have a reason to get it.

866
01:04:23,211 --> 01:04:24,579
Rym: You don't have a reason to get it.

867
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:25,684
Rym: as of now.

868
01:04:25,745 --> 01:04:27,974
Rym: that might change rapidly But right now you don't really.

869
01:04:28,034 --> 01:04:34,940
Scott: the only reason to ever have gigabit is if you're doing crazy things on your network because to fill That 100 is insane.

870
01:04:35,382 --> 01:04:42,149
Scott: Like you would have to do forwarding of 3d applications over the network to use the all of the hundred.

871
01:04:42,169 --> 01:04:45,520
Scott: and In fact, if you're doing that you should probably get the thousand.

872
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,969
Scott: but other than that a thousand is just a waste of your time.

873
01:04:49,210 --> 01:05:01,136
Rym: Now if you're going to run cable like actually run it through your walls I'm gonna have to do a whole nother episode on that because there's all sorts of fire codes and safety and all sorts of Stuff that you'd have to worry about.

874
01:05:01,276 --> 01:05:02,099
Scott: call a professional.

875
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:09,230
Rym: Yep, like me or an electrician if you're interested I could do an episode on how to do that because I know how to do that very well.

876
01:05:09,290 --> 01:05:21,864
Rym: I've run cable in walls before but the only thing I'll say right now is that if Anything else if you don't remember anything if you're ever gonna run cable inside your walls There are two basic grades of cable to worry about.

877
01:05:22,125 --> 01:05:26,769
Rym: if you buy a spool somewhere There's plenum grade and there's riser grade.

878
01:05:27,472 --> 01:05:30,020
Rym: Riser grade is what you plug your computer into.

879
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:33,050
Rym: that's what you see across the ceiling in a computer lab somewhere.

880
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:34,354
Rym: That's what you see laying on the floor.

881
01:05:34,915 --> 01:05:46,630
Rym: The only difference is that plenum grade will not give off toxic gases if it catches fire Yep, so if you're running wires through your house in the walls, you must use plenum grade.

882
01:05:46,971 --> 01:05:48,175
Rym: I cannot stress this enough.

883
01:05:48,496 --> 01:05:52,670
Rym: It is dangerous to use anything else because it does not meet fire code and you can get in trouble.

884
01:05:53,412 --> 01:05:54,877
Rym: Yep, also you could die.

885
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:55,620
Rym: not really.

886
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,927
Rym: it's not really that dangerous but it's bad.

887
01:05:58,007 --> 01:05:58,790
Rym: It's as dangerous.

888
01:05:58,890 --> 01:06:00,938
Scott: It's bad enough that someone to make a law about it.

889
01:06:01,018 --> 01:06:03,949
Rym: It's about as dangerous as semi shoddy electrical work would be.

890
01:06:04,895 --> 01:06:06,710
Rym: There's also shielded and unshielded.

891
01:06:08,052 --> 01:06:09,176
Rym: You need unshielded.

892
01:06:09,236 --> 01:06:18,830
Rym: You don't need shielded unless you're doing something interesting like Magnets or running it through a wall where there's power or all sorts of things.

893
01:06:19,171 --> 01:06:23,089
Rym: If I do when we do our stuff on how computers work our big series that's coming up.

894
01:06:23,392 --> 01:06:24,970
Rym: I'll go into great detail about the cables.

895
01:06:25,211 --> 01:06:29,225
Scott: Yeah, just if you're doing wiring between computers and the router all over your house.

896
01:06:29,747 --> 01:06:30,730
Scott: Try to keep it simple.

897
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:33,544
Scott: You know if you can find a way to just go through one wall do that.

898
01:06:33,624 --> 01:06:36,198
Scott: if you can find a way to go around The edge of the room do that.

899
01:06:36,761 --> 01:06:38,170
Scott: try not to go in the walls.

900
01:06:38,351 --> 01:06:41,505
Scott: It's a lot easier and it leaves you a lot more options.

901
01:06:41,525 --> 01:06:49,390
Rym: if you want to move stuff around Yeah If you're going through the walls You basically have to plan that from the start and you'll basically want to build a wiring closet and all sorts of fun stuff.

902
01:06:49,611 --> 01:06:54,026
Scott: Yeah, or get a house that's already wired and then put your computer near all the jacks in the walls.

903
01:06:54,347 --> 01:07:02,632
Rym: now the basic advice I'll give for running wires You have a lot of computers is that you want to have your big old switch in a central location and run all the cables To that.

904
01:07:03,094 --> 01:07:08,958
Rym: the only exception is if say the cable modem comes in upstairs like in our house And you've got two computers up there.

905
01:07:08,998 --> 01:07:12,898
Rym: They plug in directly to it, but then downstairs You've got three more computers.

906
01:07:13,401 --> 01:07:19,005
Rym: instead of running three cables down there You know all over the stairs or whatever run one and put a switch on the end of it.

907
01:07:19,246 --> 01:07:19,507
Rym: Yep.

908
01:07:20,109 --> 01:07:21,937
Rym: Yep Yep, other than that.

909
01:07:21,958 --> 01:07:24,670
Rym: I mean wiring is pretty simple unless you want to do it all fancy-like.

910
01:07:25,871 --> 01:07:29,786
Rym: Now the other option if you don't want to run wires is wireless wireless rule.

911
01:07:29,867 --> 01:07:31,372
Rym: now if you have a laptop It'll just work.

912
01:07:31,413 --> 01:07:32,015
Rym: don't worry about it.

913
01:07:32,637 --> 01:07:41,528
Rym: If you have a PC and you want to put a wireless thing in it I'll warn you that wireless network cards for PCs are expensive and they suck most of them.

914
01:07:41,909 --> 01:07:44,695
Rym: Yep Now the other option there is.

915
01:07:44,716 --> 01:08:01,393
Rym: you can buy a wireless bridge which will basically you put one end of it upstairs Where your connection comes in plugged into your router or sometimes the router will do it you put the other end Downstairs and a wire comes out of it or if there's a switch on it and basically it acts like a wireless wire between those Two points.

916
01:08:01,574 --> 01:08:01,816
Rym: Yep.

917
01:08:02,158 --> 01:08:11,110
Rym: A lot of them use 802.11 a. Whoo Now I'm not gonna go into great detail about wireless in general other than a. here's a few basic things to keep in mind.

918
01:08:11,752 --> 01:08:16,145
Rym: One the things that block wireless signals are one water two metal.

919
01:08:19,231 --> 01:08:20,755
Scott: No, I'd paint bad.

920
01:08:20,774 --> 01:08:23,140
Scott: Yep, plumbing bad plumbing.

921
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:24,124
Rym: Not so bad.

922
01:08:24,163 --> 01:08:38,317
Rym: It's a little bad plumbing will cause other problems yeah, but the main thing that blocks it really is meshes of metal and Also old buildings tend to have a lot of steel reinforced whatnots inside of them which will block signals even more.

923
01:08:38,778 --> 01:08:45,679
Scott: if your wire if Your windows have chicken wire You're not gonna get your wireless to your neighbor's house unless you open the window and yet the router in the window.

924
01:08:45,738 --> 01:08:52,234
Scott: if you want To know why Google for the words Faraday cage Yep, and if you don't know how to spell Faraday Google will tell you now.

925
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:59,460
Rym: basically the advice there Is that the older your house is or the older your apartment is the more likely your walls are to block your signal?

926
01:09:00,734 --> 01:09:07,240
Rym: To You want to put the wireless access point with the little rabbit ears or whatever in a somewhat central location?

927
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:11,837
Scott: The farther away you are from that the less likely your wireless will be to work.

928
01:09:12,139 --> 01:09:19,890
Scott: three Oh if you want to do it if you want to be in your bedroom with your laptop in your living room Put the wireless between the bedroom and living room somewhere.

929
01:09:20,171 --> 01:09:22,939
Rym: three secure your wireless access point.

930
01:09:23,202 --> 01:09:24,800
Rym: There will be instructions in your router.

931
01:09:24,961 --> 01:09:26,486
Rym: There are also instructions online.

932
01:09:26,807 --> 01:09:31,643
Rym: if you don't know what I'm talking about in the very least Google for WEP WEP.

933
01:09:31,984 --> 01:09:33,728
Rym: learn how to turn it on and turn it on.

934
01:09:33,988 --> 01:09:38,240
Scott: in fact use WPA instead of WEP wherever possible.

935
01:09:38,421 --> 01:09:44,460
Scott: Yes, you have a Nintendo DS then use WEP because Nintendo DS doesn't support WPA.

936
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:48,720
Rym: Yeah, but at least use WEP because that works fairly well.

937
01:09:48,819 --> 01:09:53,060
Scott: It'll keep most a million ways to break it, but random idiots won't be able to break it.

938
01:09:53,361 --> 01:09:57,680
Rym: And you're much more worried about random idiots than you are about hackers because a hacker will get in anyway.

939
01:09:57,961 --> 01:09:59,707
Scott: Yeah, there's not much you can do about the hacker.

940
01:10:00,189 --> 01:10:06,274
Scott: You know WPA can stop them from getting in by the wireless way But there's so many other ways You know.

941
01:10:06,902 --> 01:10:16,054
Rym: But I guess my last bit here because we have gone on fairly long about this is that if you're setting up wireless there Are three types of wireless networking that exists now that you will run into.

942
01:10:16,716 --> 01:10:19,566
Rym: there's 802.11 a Which is old.

943
01:10:19,767 --> 01:10:21,515
Rym: it's somewhat obsolete now.

944
01:10:21,535 --> 01:10:28,060
Rym: It uses a lot of power And it's generally only used for point-to-point links or wireless bridges like I talked about just a little while ago.

945
01:10:28,823 --> 01:10:30,972
Rym: You probably won't even see that there's 802.b and 802.g.

946
01:10:33,382 --> 01:10:34,566
Rym: B is the older one.

947
01:10:34,667 --> 01:10:35,630
Rym: G is the newer one.

948
01:10:36,012 --> 01:10:43,685
Rym: G is fully backward compatible with B. B is not always forward compatible with G Mm-hmm.

949
01:10:43,705 --> 01:10:47,360
Rym: so and there are access points that will do B G or both.

950
01:10:48,022 --> 01:10:56,480
Rym: When in doubt get the higher one because a G router will work just fine with your B laptop But your and your G laptop will work just fine with your B router.

951
01:10:57,122 --> 01:11:04,530
Rym: But your B laptop will not work with your G only router Which usually those things aren't very common anymore.

952
01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:05,373
Scott: G routers don't.

953
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:07,180
Scott: G only routers don't really exist.

954
01:11:07,461 --> 01:11:13,240
Scott: Yeah, I've seen them, but yeah the thing you really have to know is that you know B or G will work.

955
01:11:13,521 --> 01:11:17,457
Scott: But ideally you want a G router and G computer to get maximum speed.

956
01:11:17,598 --> 01:11:21,260
Scott: yes You know if either end is B. It'll work, but it'll be the slower.

957
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:23,542
Scott: It'll always default to B Which is slower.

958
01:11:23,883 --> 01:11:24,566
Scott: G is faster.

959
01:11:24,586 --> 01:11:30,128
Rym: you want G now with B and in general you're going to have at some point when you set This up, and you'll follow the instructions.

960
01:11:30,168 --> 01:11:31,980
Rym: It'll ask you what channel you want to use.

961
01:11:32,402 --> 01:11:36,722
Rym: I'm not going to explain why but your options are 1 6 or 11.

962
01:11:36,722 --> 01:11:37,506
Scott: I like 11.

963
01:11:37,506 --> 01:11:38,552
Rym: don't pick anything else.

964
01:11:39,255 --> 01:11:44,335
Rym: if you're having trouble Find out if any of your neighbors have wireless access points and set it to a different channel.

965
01:11:44,475 --> 01:11:46,607
Scott: if your neighbor uses one your other Neighbor uses six.

966
01:11:46,748 --> 01:11:47,655
Scott: eleven is the way to go.

967
01:11:47,676 --> 01:11:49,559
Scott: yep I get three neighbors.

968
01:11:50,725 --> 01:11:55,757
Rym: If you really want to know Google around or ask me and I'll explain in the forums Why you pick one six or eleven.

969
01:11:55,918 --> 01:11:56,100
Rym: yeah?

970
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:57,064
Rym: It's kind of complicated.

971
01:11:57,104 --> 01:12:00,338
Scott: don't pick two three four five seven eight nine ten.

972
01:12:00,379 --> 01:12:02,220
Scott: well But don't don't pick them.

973
01:12:02,281 --> 01:12:02,737
Scott: They're bad.

974
01:12:03,241 --> 01:12:06,591
Rym: But in general wireless networking like wired networking.

975
01:12:07,172 --> 01:12:09,940
Rym: in this modern day with links this stuff tends to just work.

976
01:12:10,201 --> 01:12:18,857
Scott: Yep, and once you have the wireless part working your computer will act just like every other computer That's plugged in with a wire only its wireless, and you can walk around with it.

977
01:12:19,339 --> 01:12:20,705
Rym: Yep I mean that should be it for today.

978
01:12:21,027 --> 01:12:24,000
Rym: This was a very very brief and cursory overview.

979
01:12:24,241 --> 01:12:26,011
Scott: Oh, there's one last thing to know about wireless.

980
01:12:26,413 --> 01:12:34,068
Scott: if you have a wireless access point It's G right and you're a bunch of friends over and everyone has a G laptop But one guy has a B laptop.

981
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:37,820
Scott: it'll work, but now everyone is gonna be brought down to be.

982
01:12:38,961 --> 01:12:45,799
Scott: So if you have like ten friends and one guy has B because he sucks Don't let him on your network cuz you're gonna slow everyone else down.

983
01:12:47,681 --> 01:12:59,759
Rym: But basically if you're interested in all the nitty-gritty because I actually found it difficult to talk about this without going into insane detail We're starting up at some point soon our long ongoing series on how computers work.

984
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:02,359
Rym: on fundamental exact details.

985
01:13:02,561 --> 01:13:11,180
Scott: We're gonna start with the lowest possible level Electricity and go up to the highest possible level playing 3d games of surround sound on the crowd.

986
01:13:11,521 --> 01:13:19,760
Rym: Oh, and part of that is going to be a very long tedious section on networking Maybe more than one section on networking.

987
01:13:20,181 --> 01:13:23,493
Rym: So if you have any very specific questions, you can ask me.

988
01:13:23,874 --> 01:13:31,120
Rym: but just know that at some point in the future I'm going to do a fairly detailed show where I won't have to keep stopping myself to think of a simpler way to explain something.

989
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:37,461
Scott: I mean, we'll probably do like a whole episode on email and a whole episode on web and a whole episode on all kinds of Stuff.

990
01:13:37,562 --> 01:13:40,078
Rym: Yep our RAM as someone asked about in the forums.

991
01:13:40,138 --> 01:13:49,918
Scott: Yep We'll probably do memory twice because one time we'll talk about memory on the hardware level and then we'll talk about Memory usage when we talk about operating systems.

992
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:59,240
Rym: Yep If there's one thing you want to take away about memory as a nice little tidbit before we go One of the things that makes Linux so good compared to Windows is that Linux handles memory really really well.

993
01:13:59,561 --> 01:14:01,932
Scott: Yeah, Linux isn't stupid when it comes to RAM.
