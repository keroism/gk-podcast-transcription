Scott: Where did burning wheel originate from?

92
00:05:24,061 --> 00:05:25,730
Scott: like when did you first get the idea?

93
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:30,790
Scott: How did you actually you know go from thinking about it to actually doing it?

94
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:34,250
Scott: Because that seems to be most people's problem taking the idea, you know execution.

95
00:05:36,231 --> 00:05:40,421
Scott: Let's see Who what why once we already know who.

96
00:05:40,662 --> 00:05:52,790
Guest 0: I had a bad role-playing game session And I got really mad and I dragged my friend Dan out to a restaurant in the east West Village West Village called dojo's and I sat down and I said Dan we need to make our own game.

97
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,573
Guest 0: This game sucks.

98
00:05:54,537 --> 00:05:55,420
Guest 0: and Dan said okay.

99
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:56,043
Guest 0: Awesome.

100
00:05:56,645 --> 00:05:57,870
Guest 0: We should use eight-sided dice.

101
00:05:58,432 --> 00:06:00,258
Scott: So what happened between then?

102
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:03,970
Scott: and publishing books and running around to every convention in the universe?

103
00:06:04,852 --> 00:06:06,322
Scott: And being interviewed on podcast?

104
00:06:06,322 --> 00:06:13,503

105
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:20,363
Guest 1: Oh Well, originally I mean you didn't even intend to publish burning wheel.

106
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,754
Guest 0: that's right, that's right Burning right.

107
00:06:23,775 --> 00:06:25,990
Guest 0: burning wheel was just made to fix problems at my table.

108
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,220
Guest 0: It wasn't even called burning mill to start.

109
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,430
Guest 0: It wasn't even a fantasy game to start.

110
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,018
Guest 0: It was a science-fiction role-playing games.

111
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:34,115
Guest 0: this it was a science-fiction role-playing game We didn't intend to publish.

112
00:06:34,135 --> 00:06:37,468
Guest 0: it was just to fix our deal to fix our damage.

113
00:06:37,528 --> 00:06:37,809
Guest 0: damn it.

114
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:53,109
Guest 1: Actually, it was really neat last year when we held the release party for burning wheel revised and Luke brought out all of the old editions of burning wheel Everything from the pamphlets to the little black cover books.

115
00:06:54,431 --> 00:06:59,080
Guest 0: How many yeah, I would basically Every six months or a year.

116
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,510
Guest 0: I would rewrite the whole game.

117
00:07:01,771 --> 00:07:03,638
Guest 0: Actually, I kept translating it at one point.

118
00:07:03,658 --> 00:07:06,709
Guest 0: I was translating it back from fantasy to science fiction science fiction.

119
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:08,908
Guest 0: I just rewrite the whole thing each time.

120
00:07:10,091 --> 00:07:12,744
Guest 0: It's a good good exercise actually a painful, but good.

121
00:07:12,784 --> 00:07:15,416
Guest 0: and then I would stay in Starting like 96.

122
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:20,305
Guest 0: I would start printing them myself I would do kinko's versions of the books and just print out.

123
00:07:20,345 --> 00:07:21,772
Guest 0: print like a run of 12.

124
00:07:21,772 --> 00:07:25,629
Guest 0: And I was so excited and I give them out to my friends and we'd have big burning wheel parties and play it.

125
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:26,272
Guest 0: That's fun.

126
00:07:27,137 --> 00:07:28,686
Guest 0: It was terrible, but I mean it was fun.

127
00:07:28,927 --> 00:07:29,229
Guest 0: fun to do.

128
00:07:30,211 --> 00:07:34,610
Scott: So what makes burning wheel different and more awesome than every other role-playing system?

129
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,859
Scott: Because I agree that it is different and more awesome.

130
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,683
Scott: other role-playing system.

131
00:07:38,703 --> 00:07:46,652
Scott: a lot of people go and they say I'm gonna make my RPG system and I'm gonna fix D&D cuz these are all the problems with it and they completely and utterly fail and no one plays Their game.

132
00:07:46,752 --> 00:07:48,979
Guest 0: tour tours gonna answer this question doors gonna feel this one.

133
00:07:49,862 --> 00:07:56,032
Guest 0: I met Tori at uber con and this very hotel Four years ago three years ago Three or four years ago, I think.

134
00:07:56,193 --> 00:07:56,433
Guest 0: All right.

135
00:07:56,633 --> 00:08:03,807
Guest 0: So right so and Torah since become pretty much my right leg Kicking me in the ass.

136
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,374
Guest 0: So alright, so tour what makes burning wheel special and rad.

137
00:08:07,394 --> 00:08:27,348
Guest 1: Well, I think for me it's about the focus on I guess choices and consequences and I think that's the essence of good drama and The fact that burning wheel really supports that and Pushes you toward that Is is what makes it really special.

138
00:08:27,488 --> 00:08:29,676
Guest 0: So how does it support choices and consequences?

139
00:08:29,696 --> 00:08:30,900
Guest 0: better than well?

140
00:08:31,183 --> 00:08:31,849
Guest 1: I think that it's.

141
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:32,919
Guest 1: it's simply the focus.

142
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:38,535
Guest 1: I mean first you've got your beliefs which are really what drive play.

143
00:08:38,677 --> 00:08:57,855
Guest 1: every character has them every player writes them for his character and they're really about how the character gets rewarded and The GM is there to test those beliefs and you've constantly got to make choices About how strongly you believe in something and whether that belief is is worth it.

144
00:08:58,658 --> 00:08:58,999
Guest 0: Sure.

145
00:08:59,059 --> 00:08:59,982
Guest 0: Sure Interesting.

146
00:09:00,284 --> 00:09:02,636
Guest 0: So alright, then that's pretty good.

147
00:09:02,656 --> 00:09:06,912
Guest 0: I actually agree with Tor But you you played in my game last year.

00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,380
Rym: I said what whatever it's for some nerds making some things by terrible.

153
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:39,543
Guest 0: You were sure you were right because I've run into a bunch of terrible systems me too I'm one of them.

154
00:09:39,724 --> 00:09:42,296
Rym: and then you actually came out and convinced me like hey, come here.

155
00:09:42,317 --> 00:09:43,000
Rym: We're gonna do a demo.

156
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,785
Rym: We need a third person.

157
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:44,671
Guest 0: Oh great.

158
00:09:44,953 --> 00:09:45,900
Rym: Yes, I sat down.

159
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,537
Rym: It was elves fighting dwarves and I thought this is dumb.

160
00:09:48,557 --> 00:09:48,980
Rym: This is dumb.

161
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:59,200
Rym: This is dumb until we actually started using the game mechanics and I just thought wow a really big Combat took like a minute and a half to resolve.

162
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,103
Guest 0: That's amazing.

163
00:10:01,766 --> 00:10:08,460
Rym: And then I'd look at it more and you said that there was a social conflict Thing and the idea of that was just fascinating.

164
00:10:08,601 --> 00:10:12,140
Rym: I'd never seen a system that incorporated that before and it just it drove me wild.

165
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,840
Rym: So when I saw you were at this con the next year, I grabbed all my friends that we have to play this game.

166
00:10:17,261 --> 00:10:18,646
Guest 0: Right, right.

167
00:10:18,806 --> 00:10:30,100
Scott: Yeah, I know that rims biggest peeve is that whenever we play D&D it's you know Normal role-playing because we're okay role players and then as soon as there's a combat It's five hours of rolling dice and moving guys around a map.

168
00:10:30,282 --> 00:10:38,800
Scott: So, you know See the fact that burning wheel compresses that into like ten seconds of people standing up and yelling instead of people lazing about bored.

169
00:10:39,022 --> 00:10:42,323
Guest 0: Well, I mean ten seconds is perhaps But

170
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,571
Scott: relatively yeah,

171
00:10:46,193 --> 00:10:48,800
Guest 1: but we definitely have some knockdown drag-out fights.

172
00:10:49,242 --> 00:10:59,799
Guest 0: Yeah, every so often there's an aberrant burning wheel combat that will take three hours But more often than not maybe maybe an hour at the most and you're done and hard.

173
00:11:00,421 --> 00:11:07,304
Scott: I guess what I really noticed about it is I played the the demo with like the thief You play the sword.

174
00:11:07,525 --> 00:11:13,630
Scott: Yeah the sword and you know, it didn't you D&D It's really if the players are work.

175
00:11:13,671 --> 00:11:14,900
Scott: You have to kind of work together.

176
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:18,693
Scott: Oh, it's like a party but in burning wheel you can all it's.

177
00:11:18,974 --> 00:11:29,639
Scott: you're fighting the other PCs But you're all really going towards the same goal, which is not necessarily to achieve an in-game goal But to have an awesome role-playing game sure no matter what the result is.

178
00:11:30,081 --> 00:11:41,440
Guest 1: Running the sword is really interesting actually because you can actually see When a person's comprehension there's lights up that they don't have to just go along with what everyone else is doing, right?

179
00:11:42,121 --> 00:11:42,444
Guest 0: Right, right.

180
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:42,605
Guest 0: Right.

181
00:11:42,646 --> 00:11:43,473
Guest 0: Yeah, it's not about that.

182
00:11:43,513 --> 00:11:43,957
Guest 0: It's about.

183
00:11:45,062 --> 00:11:48,019
Guest 0: It's about getting what you want and making it cool for everyone else.

184
00:11:49,382 --> 00:11:54,840
Guest 0: And I mean that's not the only way to play burning wheel But it's definitely a way that it supports and it's functional and it's fun.

185
00:11:55,562 --> 00:11:59,353
Rym: I mean playing that specific demo with Scott and Pete and you it did I had.

186
00:11:59,393 --> 00:12:03,871
Rym: the revelation I had was that there can be Interpart or intra party conflict.

187
00:12:04,152 --> 00:12:05,820
Rym: that doesn't ruin the game, right?

188
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,800
Rym: Then you can have characters that don't like each other and that fight with each other and that can make the story better.

189
00:12:11,081 --> 00:12:11,806
Rym: Yes worse.

190
00:12:12,027 --> 00:12:15,404
Guest 0: Yeah, and I actually try to foster that In my games.

191
00:12:16,128 --> 00:12:18,820
Guest 0: I always have and I design burning wheel around that play priority.

192
00:12:19,021 --> 00:12:21,189
Guest 1: Well part of that is just that you had players that would do that.

193
00:12:21,249 --> 00:12:24,020
Guest 0: Anyway, yeah, my players are bastards.

194
00:12:24,964 --> 00:12:26,450
Guest 0: So right, but I but I like it too.

195
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:41,680
Guest 0: I would I would engender it and you know It was one of my play priorities as a as a GM because one of the things that I just intuitively realized I did not I was not able to articulate until a few years ago Is it really the only thing happening at the table is the interaction between the players?

196
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:46,137
Guest 0: That is almost always the most exciting thing, you know, and the GM is a player.

197
00:12:46,157 --> 00:13:03,377
Guest 0: in this case Sometimes every so often the GM hauls out some awesome description and everyone's like, yeah But other times, you know tour and I are going at it or arguing or whatever like torn I. actually we were playing a game recently and we clashed and got to a tussle and fought and and One of the other players thought it was over thought it was like the whole game was gonna end.

198
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:08,176
Guest 0: You know cuz you know, we threw each other into the into the bay or whatever.

199
00:13:08,236 --> 00:13:09,542
Guest 1: We were having a blast Yeah, right.

200
00:13:09,602 --> 00:13:10,666
Guest 0: or and I were like, right?

201
00:13:10,687 --> 00:13:12,373
Guest 0: We were red-faced and bad.

202
00:13:12,474 --> 00:13:15,972
Guest 0: But afterwards I was like, no, that was awesome That was totally what we would do and it was great and like.

203
00:13:16,013 --> 00:13:16,818
Guest 0: and now we move on.

204
00:13:17,942 --> 00:13:18,947
Guest 0: You know wasn't the end of the game.

205
00:13:18,988 --> 00:13:25,980
Guest 0: It wasn't bad feelings, you know tour and I weren't Firing off angry emails to each other and it's been coloring everything that we've been playing since right.

206
00:13:26,442 --> 00:13:36,479
Guest 0: so yeah that kind of conflict and strife or what it's all about for me and to Get that energy between the players and that kind of electricity going I think adds a lot to the game.

207
00:13:37,563 --> 00:13:44,670
Scott: Yes, definitely what I felt when I played inheritance because usually, you know role-playing game is fun No matter which one you're playing, but it was always kind of easygoing.

208
00:13:44,731 --> 00:13:47,580
Scott: No one was really passionate about what happened.

209
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:59,240
Scott: But when we played inheritance, we were screaming like someone would when someone was gonna roll an important role the whole table would stand Like a you know what a full count at a baseball game, you know with two outs.

210
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,998
Scott: Yeah, like come on and they're like sixes would come out to be screaming and yelling.

211
00:14:03,018 --> 00:14:08,480
Guest 1: Yeah Yeah, that also brings up the other side of the equation that I mentioned earlier, which is choices and consequences.

212
00:14:09,442 --> 00:14:11,434
Guest 1: Failure really means something in burning wheel.

213
00:14:11,474 --> 00:14:18,891
Guest 1: There are consequences and It's interesting that failure can drive the game a lot of times.

214
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:29,175
Guest 1: you're moving from failure to failure and that's what's causing the players To send their characters in different directions different interesting directions that are really fascinating.

215
00:14:29,476 --> 00:14:29,677
Guest 0: Yeah.

216
00:14:29,697 --> 00:14:33,812
Guest 0: Yeah in our recent game I would so I was kind of irritated with a lot of forum posts recently.

217
00:14:34,153 --> 00:14:44,799
Guest 0: just people not kind of not getting the Not getting the failure stuff on the forums when I'm really just not getting the basic like die rolling stuff and burning wheel like Surrounding intent and task and failure and stuff like that.

218
00:14:45,081 --> 00:14:51,428
Guest 0: So I made a character destined to fail and everything he did and I have so much fun playing this guy and he's not a Fuck-up, he's got dreams.

219
00:14:51,448 --> 00:14:52,173
Guest 0: He's a real character.

220
00:14:52,194 --> 00:14:56,193
Guest 0: You know, he's got a little depth I feel but you know, I love going.

221
00:14:56,213 --> 00:14:59,850
Guest 0: I love saying, you know, alright I want to take this test and I know I'm gonna fail.

222
00:14:59,891 --> 00:15:01,740
Guest 0: and I'm just looking at the GM with big puppy-dog eyes.

223
00:15:02,122 --> 00:15:02,968
Guest 0: Please screw me.

224
00:15:03,672 --> 00:15:04,618
Guest 0: Tell me what happens now.

225
00:15:06,982 --> 00:15:20,380
Guest 1: As a matter of fact one of the first things that Luke did with that character was to make a circles role Which is a mechanic that allows you to bring in a new NPC And you get to describe how much you want to be able to determine about the NPC.

226
00:15:21,122 --> 00:15:26,200
Guest 1: But if you fail the GM takes over and he can decide and he can invoke something called the enmity clause.

227
00:15:26,641 --> 00:15:39,458
Guest 1: So Luke set himself up to fail that role and one die to roll one d6 Brought in a great villain that has been part of the game now for three four sessions.

228
00:15:39,819 --> 00:15:44,900
Guest 0: Yeah Oh, yeah, I basically just threw a softball to the GM our friend my urn and he just hit it out of the park.

229
00:15:46,486 --> 00:15:51,976
Guest 0: Just like yeah this dude You know just gave this dude a little character a name and a little character and so much fun.

230
00:15:52,197 --> 00:15:52,719
Guest 0: all from failure.

231
00:15:53,201 --> 00:16:00,557
Guest 1: I'm failure and the fact that we created him Just makes it really personal like we really care right what this guy does, right?

232
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:02,405
Guest 0: Oh, I like it Like I want to be him.

233
00:16:03,047 --> 00:16:13,665
Scott: So anyway, so that blah blah blah boring bring real stuff boring boring boring Alright, so for someone out there who you know may or may not already be a gamer or not What do you suggest they do?

234
00:16:13,725 --> 00:16:17,917
Scott: if they want to learn burning wheel get into it start playing it.

235
00:16:17,997 --> 00:16:25,539
Guest 0: They should play If they're not a gamer if they are or they aren't well things if they're not a gamer they should play.

236
00:16:26,181 --> 00:16:28,067
Guest 1: Prime time in prime time inspectors.

237
00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:29,633
Guest 0: Yeah by Jared Sorenson.

238
00:16:29,653 --> 00:16:35,345
Guest 0: prime time adventures by Matt Wilson dust devils by Matt Snyder writer.

239
00:16:35,545 --> 00:16:41,533
Guest 0: Yeah other small press games which are designed for elegance and simplicity And but they have the same.

240
00:16:41,574 --> 00:16:46,699
Guest 0: they have a very similar Aesthetic is burning wheel surrounding beliefs and consequences and stuff like that.

241
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:53,559
Guest 0: But they do not have the say tactical depth that my game Slavishly reproduces at the table.

242
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,165
Scott: I have to check those out and never heard of them.

243
00:16:56,386 --> 00:16:57,228
Guest 0: Oh, yeah.

244
00:16:57,248 --> 00:17:02,566
Guest 0: Yeah, they fantastic games really the pinnacle of Contemporary game design.

245
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,079
Guest 0: excellent stuff inspectors is is in my opinion.

246
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:09,873
Guest 0: Well up till very recently was the best game best role-playing game ever produced.

247
00:17:10,012 --> 00:17:11,738
Guest 0: that may still be damn inspectors.

248
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:12,138
Guest 1: Damn it.

249
00:17:12,681 --> 00:17:13,564
Guest 1: Are you thinking of lacuna?

250
00:17:13,645 --> 00:17:16,276
Guest 0: I love lacuna Jared my friend Jared Sorenson's new game.

251
00:17:16,497 --> 00:17:17,180
Guest 1: He's a rock star.

252
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,325
Guest 0: He is a game rock star.

253
00:17:18,365 --> 00:17:20,415
Guest 0: this game you play these.

254
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:21,480
Guest 0: it's so easy.

255
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,153
Guest 0: I actually introduced someone to role-playing with it recently.

256
00:17:23,173 --> 00:17:23,920
Guest 0: with using lacuna.

257
00:17:26,021 --> 00:17:35,248
Guest 0: You play members of this mysterious company who have tapped the collective unconsciousness and you lie down on these like Slabs and they hook into your dreams.

258
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:42,399
Guest 0: and then you go into this into the collective unconsciousness and you eradicate aberrant personalities from people like you're like.

259
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,229
Guest 0: so you lie next to the slab like you're.

260
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:45,616
Guest 0: you're all in your slabs and the.

261
00:17:45,717 --> 00:17:53,460
Guest 0: basically your Target is lying on a slab next to you And who's like a psychotic or you know, you know, hyper neurotic or something or schizophrenic or whatever.

262
00:17:53,721 --> 00:17:59,240
Guest 0: And then you go into the collective unconsciousness you hunt down their aberrant personality and you destroy it and cure them.

263
00:17:59,541 --> 00:17:59,681
Guest 1: Right.

264
00:17:59,862 --> 00:18:01,308
Guest 1: Did you see the quotation marks there?

265
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:02,874
Guest 0: And oh, yeah, can you hear the quote?

266
00:18:02,894 --> 00:18:03,777
Guest 0: you hear the quotation marks?

267
00:18:03,818 --> 00:18:04,038
Guest 0: Thank you.

268
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:10,509
Guest 0: And the way gameplay works is It's all based on your heartbeat.

269
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:11,555
Guest 0: Anytime you want to do something.

270
00:18:11,595 --> 00:18:12,280
Guest 0: You're just trying to.

271
00:18:14,362 --> 00:18:15,919
Guest 0: Anytime you do something you increase your heart rate.

272
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:17,344
Guest 0: And so it.

273
00:18:17,745 --> 00:18:22,380
Guest 0: it is incredibly simple incredibly elegant and it's so much fun to play.

274
00:18:22,885 --> 00:18:26,227
Guest 0: It's got a great element of mystery But the GM actually can't make any rolls.

275
00:18:26,488 --> 00:18:28,375
Guest 0: the GM can introduce tests and conflicts.

276
00:18:28,415 --> 00:18:29,800
Guest 0: the GM doesn't actually roll anything.

277
00:18:30,262 --> 00:18:31,248
Guest 0: It's so neat.

278
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:33,359
Guest 0: It's such a simple neat game design.

279
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:42,406
Guest 0: and so yeah, I've run it twice recently and had a blast yet or played in both games and I just Will find that and link to it.

280
00:18:42,527 --> 00:18:43,391
Guest 0: Yeah lacuna.

281
00:18:43,531 --> 00:18:44,034
Guest 0: Absolutely.

282
00:18:44,275 --> 00:18:47,885
Guest 0: Um on Memento Mori Yeah, it's 20 bucks.

283
00:18:47,945 --> 00:18:50,796
Guest 1: It's I'm telling you guys you can find inspectors there too.

284
00:18:50,877 --> 00:18:53,959
Scott: Yeah, it's All right.

285
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:59,680
Scott: so if someone's already played these amazing games and they want to play burning wheel because they're listening to this show and they've been.

286
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,984
Scott: Somehow can sure sure.

287
00:19:01,004 --> 00:19:01,165
Guest 0: Sure.

288
00:19:01,185 --> 00:19:01,365
Guest 0: Sure.

289
00:19:02,128 --> 00:19:05,619
Guest 0: My first recommendation is come to a convention even one that.

290
00:19:07,362 --> 00:19:09,709
Guest 0: Go to a convention and play games with other people.

291
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,592
Guest 0: go to convention.

292
00:19:10,652 --> 00:19:13,080
Guest 0: ask people if they know about other games burning wheel or whatever.

293
00:19:14,168 --> 00:19:14,719
Guest 0: What I found.

294
00:19:15,902 --> 00:19:18,078
Guest 0: I've been doing the convention circuit for about four years now.

295
00:19:18,984 --> 00:19:21,218
Guest 0: It conventions are a great way to meet other gamers.

296
00:19:21,318 --> 00:19:21,459
Guest 0: who?

297
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:28,978
Guest 0: Suit your gaming type and get in games that you would not normally get because your group well, you know They like playing this one game.

298
00:19:29,642 --> 00:19:30,405
Guest 0: So go to a convention.

299
00:19:30,446 --> 00:19:31,088
Guest 0: try other things.

300
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:31,932
Guest 0: try new things.

301
00:19:32,073 --> 00:19:33,740
Guest 0: push the limit if you see burning wheel.

302
00:19:36,181 --> 00:19:44,804
Guest 1: But specifically for burning wheel if you can't get the full Luke crane experience we recommend going to our wiki and Downloading our demo the sword.

303
00:19:44,925 --> 00:19:53,609
Guest 1: Yeah and running it for the group or players for players for pre-made characters You can run it in two to four hours.

304
00:19:54,031 --> 00:19:54,853
Guest 0: Yeah, depending.

305
00:19:55,014 --> 00:20:00,277
Guest 1: Yeah, it's a small commitment But it it will show you the possibilities.

306
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:00,992
Guest 0: Yeah Yeah.

307
00:20:01,281 --> 00:20:08,265
Rym: So when you run these games at conventions and usually the scenarios you set up seem to be very much centered around Conflict within the party.

308
00:20:08,626 --> 00:20:14,618
Rym: Yeah, you seem to act more like a director than a dungeon master Like these are people playing out a play out.

309
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:23,180
Rym: Just talk a little bit about how you get people to roleplay and how you draw out of them these emotions Just what you're thinking while you're running sure.

310
00:20:23,861 --> 00:20:33,278
Guest 0: Yeah, I don't know how I get people to do anything really but um First of all, we start it starts at burning wheel headquarters with me and tour.

311
00:20:34,543 --> 00:20:35,067
Guest 0: I'm serious.

312
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:45,074
Guest 0: and we where we design these characters we really carefully design the characters to make sure that all of the characters have a reason to be in the scenario and That we try to tie them all to each other.

313
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:45,940
Guest 0: Why?

314
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:56,060
Guest 0: One because my my goal at these demos is to teach people The game and to have them rolling dice in as much as possible using the mechanics of the game.

315
00:20:56,905 --> 00:21:06,140
Guest 0: Now if I do that in a traditional game format You guys know there's a lot of like waiting your turn and stuff in a traditional game format Especially when you do not know the rules and you're not comfortable with the game.

316
00:21:06,321 --> 00:21:06,884
Guest 0: So you're kind of like.

317
00:21:06,924 --> 00:21:07,507
Guest 0: can I do this?

318
00:21:07,547 --> 00:21:08,935
Guest 0: Can I do you know, so you're.

319
00:21:09,015 --> 00:21:09,920
Guest 0: so there's waiting involved.

320
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:12,048
Guest 0: So I was like so I I ran the.

321
00:21:12,249 --> 00:21:19,837
Guest 0: my initial demos were traditional role-playing games, you know We're you know traditional like go and solve this thing and get into a fight and win.

322
00:21:19,877 --> 00:21:22,209
Guest 0: and Godin's predicament I'm going to predicament was the original one.

323
00:21:22,571 --> 00:21:24,020
Guest 0: You had to rescue some guy from the roof of a house.

324
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:24,833
Guest 0: There were orcs in the house.

325
00:21:26,381 --> 00:21:28,528
Guest 0: So and I was like, this is boring it sucked.

326
00:21:28,568 --> 00:21:32,661
Guest 0: people were sitting around waiting their turn and and so I tried I tried something Different.

327
00:21:32,681 --> 00:21:33,023
Guest 0: I tried to.

328
00:21:33,687 --> 00:21:35,356
Guest 0: I tried the original poisonous ambition.

329
00:21:35,376 --> 00:21:41,540
Guest 0: I tried to turn I tried to give them an external goal and an internal goal and it just lit on fire.

330
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:52,636
Guest 1: so poisonous ambition was a scenario in which you all played the members of an orc clan that was disintegrating just falling apart and the power structure was failing.

331
00:21:52,656 --> 00:21:59,800
Guest 1: right and Everybody had you know a reason to go in there and just really tear stuff apart, right?

332
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,193
Guest 0: Right, and so I mean right.

333
00:22:02,213 --> 00:22:07,932
Guest 0: you tell people right orcs Disintegrating clan, you know power struggle and immediately everyone gets it and they go.

334
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:21,955
Guest 0: I mean, yeah, the scenario was problematic but regardless though by basically giving all the players a stake giving them a tie to another character and Encouraging that behavior I if you played with me, you know, I go around.

335
00:22:21,996 --> 00:22:22,999
Guest 0: I whisper in your ear.

336
00:22:23,461 --> 00:22:24,385
Guest 0: Why are you sitting there?

337
00:22:24,767 --> 00:22:25,470
Guest 0: What are you doing?

338
00:22:25,871 --> 00:22:26,434
Guest 0: What do you want?

339
00:22:26,494 --> 00:22:26,775
Guest 0: I looked.

340
00:22:26,876 --> 00:22:29,110
Guest 0: I had players tonight whisper You freaking yell at people.

341
00:22:29,553 --> 00:22:30,380
Scott: What's wrong with you?

342
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:39,900
Guest 0: I get as the night goes on I I get a little testy but because I get Frustrated bored like you guys do and you guys have all the power in these scenarios.

343
00:22:40,182 --> 00:22:41,230
Guest 0: But tonight there were.

344
00:22:41,814 --> 00:22:42,600
Guest 0: I tried with two kids.

345
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:51,499
Guest 0: I did not succeed but I looked them in the eye and I said they were they were turtling they were sitting there just like Oh, and I said, what do you want from this?

346
00:22:52,461 --> 00:22:53,545
Guest 0: What do you want to happen?

347
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:57,100
Guest 0: and they were like I want him to be punished then do it fight for it.

348
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,990
Guest 0: Don't back down and you know, they it.

349
00:23:00,633 --> 00:23:01,576
Guest 0: this works and you know.

350
00:23:01,616 --> 00:23:15,209
Guest 0: talking players is saying, you know And saying reminding players people that you can get what you want in the next four hours and you can have fun doing it Of course because you know you guys have played, you know, all right I'm gonna go for what I want and suddenly you get Sideswiped by someone else who want.

351
00:23:15,229 --> 00:23:19,934
Guest 0: you know who wants something different or wants what you want But then somebody's saying well, but but wait you want that?

352
00:23:19,955 --> 00:23:22,766
Guest 0: Well, then I'll ally with you I'll help you and suddenly you're in the mix.

353
00:23:22,846 --> 00:23:23,087
Guest 0: Suddenly.

354
00:23:23,107 --> 00:23:23,709
Guest 0: You can't get out.

355
00:23:23,729 --> 00:23:25,234
Guest 0: It works really well.

356
00:23:25,414 --> 00:23:35,513
Guest 0: It's it's really just by right knitting everything together with with beliefs and goals and Relationships and relationships right right and making everyone, you know, like I'm your son.

357
00:23:35,654 --> 00:23:36,818
Guest 0: I'm your second-in-command.

358
00:23:36,878 --> 00:23:37,460
Guest 0: I'm this on that.

359
00:23:38,722 --> 00:23:39,627
Scott: It's hard to explain.

360
00:23:39,948 --> 00:23:41,818
Scott: Um, so Burning Empires is your new.

361
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,930
Scott: Can you tell us a little about where that came from?

362
00:23:47,231 --> 00:23:47,672
Scott: What it is?

363
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,295
Guest 0: Didn't you see the obelisk?

364
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:50,778
Scott: I did see the obelisk.

365
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:51,560
Scott: It was impressive.

366
00:23:53,322 --> 00:23:55,012
Guest 0: Burning Empires is an evolution.

367
00:23:55,053 --> 00:23:58,062
Guest 0: It's basically Burning Wheel 3.0.

368
00:23:58,062 --> 00:23:58,866
Guest 0: So it is.

369
00:23:59,107 --> 00:24:12,942
Guest 0: it's Burning Wheel that uses science fiction rules has vehicles and firefights and psychic powers and aliens and space and stuff and it's a It's.

370
00:24:13,363 --> 00:24:14,970
Guest 0: but it's also an experimental game design.

371
00:24:15,432 --> 00:24:23,983
Guest 0: We decided Tor and I Last year we said if we were gonna do this game based on these these comic books these burned these iron empires comic books Awesome.

372
00:24:24,244 --> 00:24:24,987
Guest 0: Yeah, great.

373
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:25,549
Guest 0: Great comic books.

374
00:24:25,629 --> 00:24:27,897
Guest 0: We needed to make the game different.

375
00:24:27,937 --> 00:24:32,225
Guest 0: We needed to push Kind of push the envelope of design.

376
00:24:32,486 --> 00:24:41,739
Guest 0: so so burning empires ended up being a game that combines strategy game elements And role-playing game elements and it works.

377
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:42,541
Guest 0: It's fun.

378
00:24:42,862 --> 00:24:43,745
Guest 0: It's hard though.

379
00:24:43,806 --> 00:24:47,559
Guest 0: It's like it's like you come out of that game and you're like damn that took a lot out of me.

380
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:49,543
Guest 0: Yeah, I mean you're.

381
00:24:50,025 --> 00:24:54,600
Guest 0: it engages you on levels that that it uses muscles that you're not used to using in role-playing games.

382
00:24:54,700 --> 00:25:08,477
Guest 1: well, I mean part of what we really consciously tried to do with this game was to Create the rules so that people who played it had to play the way that we play At our table, right which drives people drive some people crazy.

383
00:25:08,517 --> 00:25:09,139
Guest 1: Some people love it.

384
00:25:09,461 --> 00:25:18,453
Guest 1: Yeah, so I mean we really you know we set up this whole scene structure and that sort of thing to really pass the spotlight around and And make people really drive toward conflict, right?

385
00:25:18,494 --> 00:25:19,740
Guest 1: Just like we do at home, right?

386
00:25:19,941 --> 00:25:21,420
Guest 0: Yeah, that was one of our main conceits.

387
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,840
Guest 0: It was like people can run can turtle and run away from conflict and burning wheel and we're like Let's see if we can build it into the game design.

388
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:35,544
Guest 0: We literally cannot escape the spotlight where you know, you are thrust into the fire like, you know at every step And pretty a person's.

389
00:25:35,564 --> 00:25:36,709
Guest 0: a pretty damn good attempt at that.

390
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:39,600
Guest 0: not perfect but pretty damn good attempt in that regard.

391
00:25:40,841 --> 00:25:49,420
Scott: And it's got pretty art All right, so you talk about you know, how you trying to make people game the way you game at your table.

392
00:25:49,521 --> 00:25:51,040
Scott: How do you game at your table?

393
00:25:51,320 --> 00:26:00,599
Scott: And it's like I feel myself like like I want to gain like I can get an idea of the way you game at your Table even though I've never been there and like I want to get there but now I'm somewhere else.

394
00:26:01,241 --> 00:26:13,848
Scott: What advice did you give someone who wants to game as awesomely as you do and just doesn't have the Cojones, all right Every game at our table is super hot.

395
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:14,269
Guest 0: Awesome.

396
00:26:14,691 --> 00:26:17,519
Guest 0: Ah, you know, we we do the best we can with what we have.

397
00:26:18,426 --> 00:26:28,220
Guest 0: Like all good things that arose from boredom We just basically got bored of fucking around and jerking off at the gaming table and we became conscious of these moments in play That we liked and we kind of look at each other.

398
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,819
Guest 0: So how can we keep doing the thing that we like to do and cut out the boring part?

399
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:45,320
Guest 0: and You know if and in my opinion if you play burning wheel as written Again, if you can like if you literally could void your mind of all the other concepts you have a role-playing that would happen.

400
00:26:45,942 --> 00:26:46,685
Guest 0: Whether or not that's true.

401
00:26:46,725 --> 00:26:51,783
Guest 0: I don't know but you know in my little imaginative game designer world That's what happens.

402
00:26:51,823 --> 00:27:05,479
Guest 0: but I mean ultimately it comes down to a little a little communication Saying these are the things I would like in this game And then honestly the guts or the balls to step up and go for what you want.

403
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:09,914
Guest 1: I think it really comes back to the choices and consequences that I mentioned earlier.

404
00:27:09,934 --> 00:27:23,575
Guest 1: We really try to To build those into each character and the GM is there to really focus on the Choices and consequences that you're interested in by looking at your beliefs and trying to challenge them.

405
00:27:23,695 --> 00:27:26,827
Guest 1: right GM's gotta have balls, too and part of it is the.

406
00:27:26,928 --> 00:27:42,920
Guest 1: the players have to have some empathy for each other and really focus on on what On the arc that someone wants for their character and try to shove them into the spotlight and make them make You know the hard choice that's really going to illuminate what that character is all about.

407
00:27:43,381 --> 00:27:48,820
Guest 0: Yeah, I read this one a actual play report from a group out in like Arkansas or something.

408
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,208
Guest 0: These guys are really cool.

409
00:27:51,173 --> 00:28:15,109
Guest 0: I ended up meeting them afterwards But they like they got it this they got the style of play when they realized that it was okay to build characters Destined to succeed or fail basically to end right and they played a game and they'd set up this big epic game and they were gonna play for months and they finish it in like three or four games and like Wham-bang crazy conflict like and the GM.

410
00:28:15,129 --> 00:28:24,531
Guest 0: like realized at one point like somebody confronted like the Baron and it was his father and like You know like the Baron was there, and he's yelling at you and like the other player kind of you know I read this AP report.

411
00:28:24,612 --> 00:28:25,280
Guest 0: kind of like got it.

412
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:31,359
Guest 0: He's like wait now is my chance like I have this belief about confronting my father And you know not letting him be an evil man.

413
00:28:31,801 --> 00:28:32,705
Guest 0: well now is my chance.

414
00:28:32,785 --> 00:28:39,469
Guest 0: right now and the boom game explodes things go crazy and it's over and Afterwards like they posted they were like they were delirious.

415
00:28:39,489 --> 00:28:40,313
Guest 0: They're like oh my god.

416
00:28:40,895 --> 00:28:41,819
Guest 0: That was it we get it.

417
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,342
Guest 0: We were like.

418
00:28:42,362 --> 00:28:48,108
Guest 0: you know we we wrote you know we decided we want to play a game like this And we didn't pussyfoot around.

419
00:28:48,188 --> 00:28:49,194
Guest 0: we did it you know.

420
00:28:49,234 --> 00:29:01,660
Guest 0: and they said afterwards like wow well It could have gone longer would have been cool, but it's also cool that we Set out what we accomplished to set out and you know so they had a great understanding like oh well So we if we sculpt our goals in this particular way, then we can extend it we can make it longer.

421
00:29:02,064 --> 00:29:05,777
Guest 0: I was like oh, yeah You know I'm just reading this I had nothing to do with that.

422
00:29:06,421 --> 00:29:08,890
Guest 1: I I think actually that clarifies a point.

423
00:29:08,911 --> 00:29:21,120
Guest 1: I was trying to make earlier, and maybe I didn't quite succeed in that Make characters that are in conflict with themselves That have competing goals that are mutually exclusive.

424
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:27,240
Guest 1: Yeah, eventually that character is gonna have to make a choice yeah, and go one way or the other and man that choice is awesome.

425
00:29:27,442 --> 00:29:29,803
Guest 0: Right I mean in doing that it was something I realized recently.

426
00:29:30,084 --> 00:29:34,679
Guest 0: doing that is making your character vulnerable rather than making a character with a tight concept.

427
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,123
Guest 0: rather You know I'm the loner.

428
00:29:36,304 --> 00:29:36,926
Guest 0: I'm competent.

429
00:29:37,106 --> 00:29:38,531
Guest 0: I can do everything I can handle it.

430
00:29:38,711 --> 00:29:39,353
Guest 0: No problem.

431
00:29:39,975 --> 00:29:40,537
Guest 0: That's cool.

432
00:29:40,898 --> 00:29:41,420
Guest 0: That's fine.

433
00:29:41,581 --> 00:29:42,527
Guest 0: That's for another game.

434
00:29:42,688 --> 00:29:43,795
Guest 0: That's not for burning wheel.

435
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:53,010
Guest 0: a Character in burning wheel is vulnerable is at risk is at risk in himself is at risk in his environment Because that's where the tension comes from in these games.

436
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:53,773
Guest 0: is that because you're gonna

437
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:54,897
Scott: have to test to get by this

438
00:29:55,138 --> 00:30:26,594
Guest 0: you're gonna have To push it you're gonna have to sweat it to do it And you know and it takes a little trust in yourself and a little trust in your other players to make your character Vulnerable to make your character open to danger and like whether it be like right you know getting pressured by your mom To do something that you don't want to do or like you know or starting off saying well You know I can make this character super badass swordsman But it would be much more interesting and dangerous to start as a guy who wants to be a badass swordsman you know and and Shove that into play or is pretending to be a badass swordsman and see it.

439
00:30:26,634 --> 00:30:28,220
Guest 0: You know see if I can pull it off.

440
00:30:30,202 --> 00:30:45,419
Guest 1: Well one of the character that I'm playing right now in the game that I'm playing with Luke is The only character in the group that has a combat skill, but it's a really really really low combat and You know and he's a character that wants to do the right thing.

441
00:30:45,981 --> 00:30:55,630
Guest 1: But in the world that we're in doing the right thing all often means waiting into combat and pirates Terrifying every time.

442
00:30:55,852 --> 00:31:08,026
Guest 1: every time I weighed in You know it could be the time that I die right you know and and I'm not very good at combat And I'm also You know I don't have very high steel.

443
00:31:08,046 --> 00:31:10,253
Guest 1: steel is the morale mechanic in burning will.

444
00:31:10,674 --> 00:31:13,424
Guest 1: so if I if I ever get wounded or Anything like that.

445
00:31:13,444 --> 00:31:15,055
Guest 1: I'm gonna run right.

446
00:31:15,578 --> 00:31:15,860
Guest 0: It's great.

447
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,663
Guest 0: And so it like.

448
00:31:16,723 --> 00:31:22,870
Guest 0: on the other side of that we think of him as our hero and our you know and our you know Our heavy whatever, so we're like.

449
00:31:22,971 --> 00:31:30,549
Guest 0: you know he'll take care of it He'll do it, but at the same time because of the way we've sculpted our world In order to create additional tension we hate him for it.

450
00:31:31,272 --> 00:31:33,260
Guest 0: You know we hate that he kills people.

451
00:31:33,581 --> 00:31:35,310
Guest 0: We don't none of our other characters kill anyone.

452
00:31:35,431 --> 00:31:37,582
Guest 1: He hates himself for killing people too, right I mean.

453
00:31:37,642 --> 00:31:44,251
Guest 0: so like you know we just we try to just knit together all these various motivations And and you know all these various vulnerabilities for the characters.

454
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:46,360
Guest 0: and just just see what happens to see.

455
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,071
Guest 0: See if it it's any more interesting than the shit.

456
00:31:49,092 --> 00:31:50,478
Guest 0: We basically been doing for 20 or 30 years.

457
00:31:52,403 --> 00:31:56,588
Guest 0: Wow depending how old you are That's the heavy shit all right.

458
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:57,532
Scott: Let's get.

459
00:31:57,573 --> 00:31:59,220
Scott: let's get geeky and fun great.

460
00:31:59,366 --> 00:32:04,179
Scott: Let's If it's not the funniest time tell us a funny story from a session.

461
00:32:04,942 --> 00:32:13,155
Scott: Jesus like something hilarious that happened like where everyone was just laughing for 10 minutes and couldn't stop one time when we were playing D&D.

462
00:32:15,102 --> 00:32:17,112
Guest 0: This was after burning wheels already in development.

Guest 0: come on coolest snake man with snake head You know with scimitars, and he was a sorcerer.

466
00:32:30,294 --> 00:32:34,928
Guest 0: and I Recited an entire Slayer song.

467
00:32:36,253 --> 00:32:41,488
Guest 0: I got up on the chair and screamed out No, what's it called?

468
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:43,177
Guest 0: the witch one on raining blood?

469
00:32:46,023 --> 00:32:49,815
Guest 0: I know the words each layer, and I know the words, but I'm not gonna recite them now regardless.

470
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:58,007
Guest 0: I okay Slayer sound like Slayer Don't just not know this don't diss Slayer.

471
00:32:58,388 --> 00:32:59,471
Scott: No you have no idea.

Scott: Good very good.

476
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:08,978
Guest 0: so I recited the whole Slayer song and then I rolled a 20 and I started running around screaming and like was awesome.

477
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:13,171
Guest 0: and then My and all they're all laughing at me all my players laughing at me.

478
00:33:13,271 --> 00:33:20,275
Guest 0: and my friend Andy turns to my friend Pete and says Pete the chairs are empty for meaning basically.

479
00:33:20,376 --> 00:33:27,659
Guest 0: I'm in the room alone and you know just playing by myself and and and pretty much it was true.

480
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,397
Guest 0: and And we we all laughing.

481
00:33:34,365 --> 00:33:40,276
Guest 0: Hey, yeah, so there you go Slayer empty chairs alone.

482
00:33:42,003 --> 00:33:43,051
Scott: You have a different one.

483
00:33:43,091 --> 00:33:51,940
Guest 1: better I think that my funniest moment was probably during a kill puppies for Satan game.

484
00:33:53,040 --> 00:34:00,083
Scott: No, I never heard of this game, but I suddenly have an urge by Vincent by Vincent Baker the same guy that did The vineyard.

485
00:34:00,404 --> 00:34:06,039
Guest 1: yeah awesome, but kill puppies for Satan is is a different game than than dogs in the vineyard.

486
00:34:06,401 --> 00:34:11,130
Guest 1: Yeah, you play loser Satanists who kill Fluffy little animals for Satan.

487
00:34:11,311 --> 00:34:12,960
Guest 0: yeah, because that's all they can really master.

488
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,520
Guest 0: Anyway, go on come on tell the fucking story.

489
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,795
Guest 0: So don't milk it.

490
00:34:19,164 --> 00:34:26,379
Guest 1: So near the near the end of the session someone has gotten the Necronomicon, and this is summoned this big massive demon.

491
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:30,772
Guest 1: and This guy was his total cut up during the entire game.

492
00:34:30,792 --> 00:34:32,498
Guest 0: He was hysterical boy named Jill right.

493
00:34:32,518 --> 00:34:35,039
Guest 1: yeah We were laughing non-stop.

494
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:45,745
Guest 1: So at one point someone goes to command the demon and he just steps forward and and rubs out the circle Right Protecting the demon.

495
00:34:46,067 --> 00:34:48,300
Guest 1: and is this dog demon type thing?

496
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:57,679
Guest 1: Tentacles also tentacles, and I don't know who said what but his response was well fuck me.

497
00:34:57,699 --> 00:35:00,148
Guest 1: and And the demon did.

498
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:01,759
Guest 1: Luke jumped up on the table.

499
00:35:03,821 --> 00:35:06,329
Guest 1: Yeah, and did you hump his leg?

500
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:06,952
Guest 1: I got behind him.

00:35:06,992 --> 00:35:13,674
Guest 1: I crawled over him got behind him And yeah, I think I think we were laughing non-stop for about 10 minutes.

502
00:35:13,975 --> 00:35:15,060

503
00:35:15,845 --> 00:35:17,434

00:46:56,761 --> 00:46:57,146
Guest 1: Dalek.

740
00:46:57,308 --> 00:47:01,998
Guest 1: I listen to Saul Williams New hip-hop artists.

741
00:47:04,002 --> 00:47:05,996
Guest 0: There's all our geeky boring details.

742
00:47:06,076 --> 00:47:08,627
Guest 0: man See I got a really that on fast.

743
00:47:08,647 --> 00:47:09,631
Scott: I got a random question.

744
00:47:09,892 --> 00:47:11,699
Scott: Where's the burning wheel logo come from?

745
00:47:11,799 --> 00:47:12,040
Scott: obviously?

746
00:47:12,101 --> 00:47:13,220
Scott: It's a wheel on fire.

747
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:16,129
Scott: But is there like some sort of symbolism with the with the?

748
00:47:16,289 --> 00:47:19,719
Scott: you know one cog or something or the spoke or is it just?

749
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:26,700
Guest 0: Some guy Did some guy design it yet some guy obviously pretty wheel is not a unique symbol.

750
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:29,935
Guest 0: It's not an original symbol as evidenced by Chris Muller's comics.

751
00:47:30,317 --> 00:47:35,194
Guest 0: the burning wheel The burning wheel is a symbol into bedding mythology.

752
00:47:35,214 --> 00:47:36,339
Guest 0: There's a wheel of life.

753
00:47:36,802 --> 00:47:39,176
Guest 0: There's the wheel of fate in medieval Europe.

754
00:47:39,558 --> 00:47:43,958
Guest 0: one of the reasons Why I wanted this symbol, and I actually it was a symbol in my game before it was anything else.

755
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:47,292
Guest 0: I'm not getting all dreamy like looking out there into the past.

756
00:47:47,593 --> 00:47:49,180
Guest 1: It was actually an artifact in your game, right?

757
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:51,260
Guest 0: It was a symbol first and then an artifact.

758
00:47:53,083 --> 00:48:02,733
Guest 0: The design is based on a sketch by Joseph Campbell in Primitive mythology I think from a rock found at Lake Baikal.

759
00:48:02,873 --> 00:48:15,180
Guest 0: I'm fairly certain and it is essentially You know imagine the imagine the wheel But with just the the lines pointing inward just like it was if someone just scratched it in without actual the wheel circumference.

760
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:22,860
Guest 0: And he said basically the that the spiral and the star and whatnot were symbols of gateways to the other world placed at gravesites.

761
00:48:24,385 --> 00:48:27,700
Guest 0: and so I said I Let's say that's fucking awesome.

762
00:48:27,841 --> 00:48:29,397
Guest 0: And so I made a stylized version of that.

763
00:48:29,861 --> 00:48:31,651
Guest 0: And and this so I made a solid version.

764
00:48:31,671 --> 00:48:38,340
Guest 0: I introduced it as an artifact in the game And it just stuck it just and it this thing became a symbol of gateway to the other world.

765
00:48:38,963 --> 00:48:42,139
Guest 1: And your players totally geeked out when you actually named your game that.

766
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:47,994
Guest 0: Yeah Kind of I got mixed reviews, then they gave me skeptical looks.

767
00:48:48,557 --> 00:48:49,280
Guest 0: they were too close to it.

768
00:48:49,501 --> 00:48:54,157
Guest 0: Yeah, I've actually I've never released the stats for the damn wheel I keep meaning to.
