1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,090
Rym: It's Wednesday, January 25th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,430
Rym: Tonight, we talk about Last Exile and Kagehime.

3
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,068
Scott: Let's do this!

4
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:22,750
Rym: So you might have noticed that the show, uh, didn't get uploaded till this morning.

5
00:00:23,531 --> 00:00:25,850
Scott: Uh, screw you, Optimum Online.

6
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,589
Rym: Yeah, it's not even that Optimum Online went down.

7
00:00:29,591 --> 00:00:31,410
Rym: I mean, I would have understood if they just had a problem.

8
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:39,829
Rym: They had planned maintenance from midnight till 6 AM, and the show was done, and I was just about to upload it, and then, uh, my internet died.

9
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:45,329
Scott: And, uh, it's fine if they want to have their maintenance, but they should freakin' tell someone.

10
00:00:46,031 --> 00:00:56,430
Scott: I had to wake up when I was sleeping at, like, midnight, and Rym was bothering me about the internet being down, saying it was this and that and this and that, and it took me, like, ten minutes to figure out it was Cablevision.

11
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,629
Rym: It took him a few minutes to, uh, wake up enough to realize I was talking, first off.

12
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:01,518
Scott: Yeah, all right.

13
00:01:01,781 --> 00:01:02,530
Rym: And then it took me--.

14
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,069
Rym: Did you realize what answers you gave me when I said the internet is down?

15
00:01:07,091 --> 00:01:10,648
Rym: You were laying there, and you're like, "In five minutes, it'll...".

16
00:01:11,331 --> 00:01:14,109
Rym: And then, you just, like, trail off and roll over.

17
00:01:16,071 --> 00:01:19,430
Scott: Well, that's what happens when you try to wake me up at the freakin'... whatever.

18
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:20,920
Rym: It was, like, 12, 15.

19
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,190
Rym: It wasn't that late.

20
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,644
Scott: I was trying to get sleep.

21
00:01:23,704 --> 00:01:24,170
Scott: I'm tired.

22
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,888
Scott: I'm gonna go to sleep early today, probably, too.

23
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:26,450
Scott: Yeah.

24
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:27,468
Scott: As soon as you're done with this.

25
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:33,350
Scott: But anyway, uh, it freakin' sucked, and they should freakin' tell me when they're gonna do maintenance.

26
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,689
Scott: If they planned it out, they should tell me.

27
00:01:35,952 --> 00:01:38,029
Scott: That way I know, and I don't rely on it.

28
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,370
Rym: Yeah, some small measure of professionalism is all I ask from people.

29
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,570
Scott: Uh, I guess they kinda have us over a barrel, though.

30
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:54,970
Rym: Well, I guess I've discovered that, despite what people tell you when you're a child, when you grow up, don't expect anyone to actually act in a professional manner about anything.

31
00:01:55,331 --> 00:01:56,250
Rym: Almost no one does.

32
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,295
Scott: Except for yourself.

33
00:01:57,336 --> 00:01:59,770
Scott: You should expect yourself to act in a professional manner.

34
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:04,230
Rym: Well, yeah, but I've learned that I can't trust other people to ever handle things professionally.

35
00:02:04,713 --> 00:02:04,875
Scott: Nope.

36
00:02:05,942 --> 00:02:07,070
Scott: That's what makes us awesome.

37
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:13,790
Rym: And speaking of professionals who can't handle themselves professionally, uh, we all know that politicians lie.

38
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:14,888
Scott: All the time.

39
00:02:15,251 --> 00:02:17,710
Rym: And that politicians, uh, ignore facts.

40
00:02:18,051 --> 00:02:18,428
Scott: All the time.

41
00:02:18,851 --> 00:02:20,849
Rym: Well, uh, now there's scientific backing to this.

42
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:22,533
Scott: Ah.

43
00:02:22,554 --> 00:02:22,594
Scott: Uh.

44
00:02:23,015 --> 00:02:26,165
Scott: So, the facts which they ignore say they ignore facts.

45
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:26,887
Scott: So, yeah.

46
00:02:28,451 --> 00:02:42,670
Rym: Yeah, but basically they did this study where they would give a politician various data that were true, or that were false but were part of the study, about an opponent and about a political ally.

47
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,025
Rym: Things like that.

48
00:02:44,771 --> 00:02:55,470
Rym: And they discovered that, even if they weren't intending to, politicians tended to greatly gloss over any factual information that was damaging to their cause or to anyone they cared about.

49
00:02:56,671 --> 00:03:00,089
Scott: You know, um, you really can't blame 'em.

50
00:03:00,853 --> 00:03:11,925
Scott: If you don't want to be damaged, and there's a fact that is damaging to you, you know, your choices are either say that you suck and hurt yourself, or ignore it.

51
00:03:12,751 --> 00:03:21,280
Scott: I mean, if someone comes in-- It's like if there's a knife about to stab you, and somehow ignoring the knife prevents it from stabbing you, then, yeah.

52
00:03:23,873 --> 00:03:31,090
Rym: Well, I mean, part of it was at one point, they were given statements by either George Bush, if they were Republican, or John Kerry, if they were a Democrat.

53
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:37,449
Rym: And they would play two statements by the people in rapid succession that clearly contradicted each other.

54
00:03:38,491 --> 00:03:41,270
Rym: And then they were asked to consider and rate the discrepancy.

55
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:48,710
Rym: They always rated the discrepancy of their opponent hundreds of times higher than the discrepancy of the guy they're supporting.

56
00:03:50,192 --> 00:03:53,490
Scott: Ah, so basically, they don't consider what the facts actually are.

57
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,302
Scott: They just say, "Oh, that's my side, blah.

58
00:03:55,322 --> 00:03:56,148
Scott: That's their side,

59
00:03:56,168 --> 00:03:56,409
Scott: blah.".

60
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,810
Rym: Yeah, they seem to pick their side and stick to it no matter what.

61
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,549
Rym: No matter what evidence is presented, they just don't even remember the evidence that is against them.

62
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:10,789
Scott: So, they're just unthinking, uh, useless people who just-- They're automatons.

63
00:04:11,071 --> 00:04:11,670
Scott: Yeah, basically.

64
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,430
Scott: They're programmed to be on one side or the other, and they're just stuck on that side.

65
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,689
Scott: They don't actually think about issues or anything like that.

66
00:04:18,334 --> 00:04:18,608
Rym: Yeah.

67
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:19,209
Rym: Yeah.

68
00:04:19,471 --> 00:04:20,610
Rym: You know, that's just fantastic.

69
00:04:21,891 --> 00:04:28,808
Scott: I think, uh, anyone who doesn't know how to use the internet should not be allowed to govern, because it seems that-- How is-- wait, wait, wait.

70
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:31,169
Rym: How is using the internet-- Well, no, no, no.

71
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,890
Rym: -any precursor to intelligence?

72
00:04:33,453 --> 00:04:38,490
Rym: It's not, but the thing is-- I submit to you Myspace, 4chan, The Style Project, and FARC.

73
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:53,829
Scott: But I submit to you that, uh, even the punk kids who argue about whether, uh, the PS3 or the Xbox 360 is gonna be better, or which one's worth more, put more thought into it than these politicians are putting into their positions.

74
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:58,890
Rym: Now, one interesting bit, they also discovered in this study that apparently Tom Hanks is awesome.

75
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,570
Scott: Is he really that awesome?

76
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:06,129
Rym: No, but what they did is they also-- they used Tom Hanks as a neutral person when they were doing this study.

77
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:12,210
Rym: And the politicians on both sides tended to rate his statements equally.

78
00:05:13,071 --> 00:05:13,358
Scott: Mm-hmm.

79
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:19,289
Rym: So they really only showed their bias when it was against, uh, if they're a Republican or Democrat, or if they're a Democrat or Republican.

80
00:05:19,712 --> 00:05:28,150
Scott: Did they-- did they try having people who were, um, like, not Democrat or Republican, say things that were very Republican or very Democratic?

81
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:33,604
Scott: Like, have-- have Tom Hanks say, you know, "Healthcare for everyone is great," or "War is

82
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:33,805
Scott: great."?

83
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,829
Rym: No, they were only evaluating statements of fact.

84
00:05:37,653 --> 00:05:38,098
Scott: Oh, okay.

85
00:05:38,382 --> 00:05:38,726
Scott: I get it.

86
00:05:39,591 --> 00:05:46,490
Scott: That would've been interesting, though, to see them evaluate, you know, political statements said by people who weren't associated with either side.

87
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:53,128
Scott: You know, that way to see if they're actually even thinking about the issue at all or just totally basing it on the person who says it.

88
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,370
Rym: I mean, I don't know the-- many of the details of the study.

89
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,990
Rym: That's just what I get from the article that I'm, uh, linking to here.

90
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:00,471
Scott: Yeah.

91
00:06:00,713 --> 00:06:07,983
Scott: I mean, like, imagine if, like, Bush went around-- Let's say you got a recording of Bush or a fake recording of Bush saying, you know, "Universal healthcare is

92
00:06:08,023 --> 00:06:08,246
Scott: great.".

93
00:06:08,671 --> 00:06:13,186
Scott: Would Republicans go, "Yeah, just 'cause Bush was saying it," or they'd be like, "Uh, no, because I'm a

94
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:13,629
Scott: Republican.".

95
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:14,448
Rym: I don't know.

96
00:06:14,891 --> 00:06:17,029
Scott: Yeah, that-- that's what I really want to see, that kind of thing.

97
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:21,410
Scott: 'Cause then you'll know, are they actually thinking about the issues at all?

98
00:06:22,351 --> 00:06:24,750
Scott: Or are they just following in tow?

99
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:27,109
Rym: I'm gonna go with no on that.

100
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:27,717
Scott: Yeah.

101
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,610
Scott: But I still want to see, get some facts and not guesses.

102
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,149
Rym: But at least there's some good news.

103
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:37,830
Rym: West Virginia is taking steps to, uh, fight childhood obesity in an awesome way.

104
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:38,993
Scott: Hooray!

105
00:06:39,013 --> 00:06:39,276
Scott: Obesity sucks.

106
00:06:39,296 --> 00:06:42,510
Rym: They're using Dance Dance Revolution in their gym classes, officially.

107
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,490
Rym: They have a three-year deal with Konami.

108
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:56,250
Scott: Yeah, well, there used to be, um, I think a bunch of schools and gym teachers all over the place figured out that DDR is a way to get kids to move their ass, and it worked at getting kids to lose weight.

109
00:06:57,251 --> 00:07:03,621
Scott: So, but West Virginia is the first place to say, "All right, we're gonna do this big time in all the schools that we can,

110
00:07:03,742 --> 00:07:04,124
Scott: everywhere."

111
00:07:05,231 --> 00:07:08,629
Scott: Where as opposed to just, you know, a few lucky schools had cool gym teachers.

112
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:13,490
Scott: Now it's all the lucky schools in West Virginia are gonna have some DDR action.

113
00:07:14,251 --> 00:07:17,850
Rym: It seemed to have come out of the fact that DDR was extremely successful.

114
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:26,650
Rym: Kids actually are, were more fit in the school, and they, uh, they didn't really give us any good data since we're not in West Virginia.

115
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,229
Rym: It's definitely local news to them.

116
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:37,949
Scott: Yeah, well, you think about this, right, if I remember high school gym class, right, the kids who were all sporty would, let's say you were gonna run the mile, 'cause you ran the mile every gym class, right?

117
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,729
Scott: They would, uh, the kids who were all sporty would be like, "Yeah, let's go," and they'd run.

118
00:07:43,113 --> 00:07:46,150
Scott: And the fat kids would be like, "I don't wanna," and they might not even do it.

119
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:51,910
Scott: They would just, they would either just sit there, or they would just walk, or they would barely run and not even try.

120
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,849
Rym: Wow, so I never talked to them in high school, so I really have no idea.

121
00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:05,850
Scott: Yeah, they had, they had absolute, well, also in middle school and elementary school, the kids who didn't have athletic ability were not motivated to do athletics and thus remain without athletic ability.

122
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,297
Rym: Huh.

123
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:23,329
Scott: You know, so DDR, I think, works great because it's something that kids who have no athletic ability will still want to do and be good at because it's a fun video game, and thus they will gain athletic, uh, abilities and lose weight and such.

124
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:31,525
Rym: Well, I'm glad that people are at least taking a creative approach to this instead of just doing the same old "make 'em play dodgeball" or "force 'em to

125
00:08:31,565 --> 00:08:31,806
Rym: run.".

126
00:08:32,793 --> 00:08:44,250
Scott: Yeah, see, dodgeball is great and fun, and I, you know, I think every kid should still play it once in a while in gym class, but it really doesn't, you know, make anyone have better, uh, health.

127
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:50,349
Scott: 'Cause if you're, you know, some fat kid, you don't really move, you just get hit right away and then you sit down, you know?

128
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:56,370
Rym: Of course, I mean, honestly, to me, I don't think gym class should really be the, the operative factor here.

129
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:00,929
Rym: I don't think a kid who has a bad lifestyle is gonna suddenly turn around because they're taking a gym class.

130
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:07,930
Scott: No, they won't turn around because of the gym class, but actually, if, you know, I'm two ways about it.

131
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:11,450
Scott: On the one hand, you know, I'm like, "Oh, we shouldn't have gym class in school.

132
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,038
Scott: "School's for

133
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:12,386
Scott: learning.".

134
00:09:12,631 --> 00:09:18,568
Rym: Yeah, I was that way when I was a kid and I didn't take gym 'cause they just, I didn't need to, so from fifth grade on, I just never took a gym class.

135
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:29,649
Scott: But at the same time, there is significant scientific evidence to suggest that when you have better, you know, physical health and such that can, you know, be gained from a gym class, that you have better mental health,

136
00:09:30,814 --> 00:09:33,329
Rym: I know, I just, honestly, I think that that's the realm of the parents.

137
00:09:34,312 --> 00:09:39,650
Rym: And if parents are raising their kids so poorly that the kids are unfit, well, the parents need to be in trouble.

138
00:09:40,552 --> 00:09:42,750
Scott: Yeah, of course, but, you know, you could say the same thing.

139
00:09:43,011 --> 00:09:46,349
Scott: If parents are raising their kids so dumbly that they're dumb-- Yeah, and you know what?

140
00:09:46,474 --> 00:09:46,705
Rym: I do.

141
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,990
Scott: Then why even have school in the first place?

142
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:54,049
Rym: Honestly, I've got a lot of gripes with the current public education system in the US.

143
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:57,389
Scott: Oh yeah, I got gripes with it, but I'm not saying that there should be no public education system.

144
00:09:57,752 --> 00:09:58,570
Rym: No, I'm not saying that either.

145
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:07,029
Scott: Yeah, so, no matter how broken it may be, I do think that some sort of physical gym activity is important and should be had.

146
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,089
Scott: And it has a lot of benefits.

147
00:10:10,295 --> 00:10:24,576
Scott: You know, people always put it down like, oh, look at all the evils of school sports in contrast to like, you know, 'cause it takes away from the other good things like the school music program or education time and too much emphasis is put on this high school football team.

148
00:10:24,617 --> 00:10:25,829
Scott: that doesn't mean anything, really.

149
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:26,710
Scott: It's just BS.

150
00:10:27,592 --> 00:10:28,667
Scott: And there's something to that.

151
00:10:29,431 --> 00:10:37,849
Scott: But don't rub that off onto the perfectly good gym class, which, you know, might be the one chance you have to make the fat kid not fat.

152
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:55,708
Scott: You know, and people do get, you know, they've done, like, it's true, schools that have gym every day, even if it's like 15 minutes, half hour gym classes, those schools have a lot smarter kids than the schools that don't have so much gym or have gym less.

153
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:04,889
Rym: I mean, honestly, the only reason I never took gym was that I didn't want to get all sweaty in school and my schools never gave you enough time to actually take a shower.

154
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,149
Scott:  Oh, okay.

155
00:11:07,112 --> 00:11:19,270
Scott: In our school, everyone had to take gym, normal gym, but if you wanted to, you could take, like, special gym, like net games where you'd play any game involving a net, which was like, you know, ping pong, tennis, badminton.

156
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:30,289
Rym:  I technically took a class called Individual Sports that was supposed to be about, like, badminton and ping pong and tennis and whatever, but I never actually attended it and I still passed.

157
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,570
Rym:  I just kind of signed up for it and then I just hung out in other places in the school during that period.

158
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:43,427
Scott:  They had some other games, like, where you'd play all the games that involved going from back and forth, basketball, hockey, soccer, all those.

159
00:11:44,091 --> 00:11:49,569
Scott: So you could take a special gym class, you know, just to play the things you wanted, or you could take the general gym class where you just did whatever.

160
00:11:50,591 --> 00:11:54,510
Scott: And I always took the general gym class and I think it was like, it was every day, right?

161
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:55,467
Scott: I think it was every day.

162
00:11:58,054 --> 00:12:09,350
Scott: And, you know, you would go to the gym class and there was a locker room and you'd change your clothes and you had a locker, and then you did gym, then you came out and you showered and you changed your clothes and you left.

163
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,009
Rym:  There was no frickin' time to shower.

164
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,710
Scott:  I don't know, how many periods a day did your school have?

165
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,204
Rym:  We had eight, in my high school, we had eight periods a day, 45 minutes each.

166
00:12:16,957 --> 00:12:17,268
Rym: That was it.

167
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,349
Scott:  Oh, we had seven.

168
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,189
Scott: So you had more time.

169
00:12:20,691 --> 00:12:23,030
Scott: You had time, it was like 10 minutes in between each one.

170
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,869
Rym:  What, we only got five minutes in between each one.

171
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:28,448
Rym:  I realized I showed up to school at like 7.30 and I was out by two.

172
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:31,750
Scott:  We showed up at 7.30 and we were out a little after two.

173
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,370
Rym:  Yeah, and I could take eight classes and I got a 45 minute lunch, if I wanted it.

174
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,469
Rym: Lunch was just a class and you took it if you wanted it whenever you wanted it.

175
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,850
Scott:  See, ours was a little different than that.

176
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:44,330
Scott: But I guess, you know, we had time to shower, it was all good, and gym was actually a lot of fun.

177
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,188
Scott: Like, I didn't like gym so much in middle school, it was just kind of boring.

178
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:53,348
Scott: And they always made us do just like boring exercise things and stuff like that.

179
00:12:53,571 --> 00:12:56,470
Scott: But in high school we had a lot of fun in gym doing all kinds of sports.

180
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:00,349
Scott: We played like floor hockey and speedball and all kinds of stuff.

181
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:16,270
Rym:  So my last several things of the day, for those of you who've been paying attention, have been things that in some way angered me and have driven me to a righteous indignation at minimum.

182
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:17,226
Scott:  Anger.

183
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:21,429
Rym:  Yeah, though at least I got a lot of positive feedback on my chiropractic bit.

184
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:27,689
Rym: But today I have something that is the exact 180 degree opposite of that.

185
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:32,330
Rym: These kids and what they did brought a little tiny man tear to my eye.

186
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,669
Scott:  I like how you call them kids when they're like college kids.

187
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,568
Rym:  I consider myself a kid when I talk about things like this.

188
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:38,210
Scott:  All right.

189
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,609
Rym:  But I mean, these guys are the definition of testicular fortitude.

190
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,290
Scott:  They are awesome.

191
00:13:45,857 --> 00:13:46,248
Scott: Fear them.

192
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:50,718
Rym:  So basically, Alberto Gonzalez, you know, Mr.

193
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:52,050
Rym: Torture is perfectly legal.

194
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,850
Scott:  The Attorney General of the United States of America.

195
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:58,289
Rym:  Yeah, I'm not gonna mince words, he's a giant asshole.

196
00:13:58,930 --> 00:13:59,329
Scott:  He sucks.

197
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:07,609
Rym:  Political, however you wanna slice it, whichever side of the fence you're on, Alberto Gonzalez is a terrible man and should not be holding that office.

198
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,630
Scott:  I don't care who you are, if you say torture is awesome.

199
00:14:12,591 --> 00:14:17,350
Scott: First off, God, torture isn't even useful as an interrogation mechanism.

200
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:23,425
Rym:  Yeah, I tried to explain, of course I tried to have this argument with some people at my job, and they're like, yeah, we should torture the terrorists to protect me.

201
00:14:24,132 --> 00:14:34,610
Rym: And they didn't seem to believe me when I told them that there are in fact scientific studies done by the CIA back when they used to torture people, and they discovered that torturing people is so useless, you actually get worse information.

202
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:38,110
Scott:  Yeah, 'cause when you torture someone, all they want you to do is stop torturing them.

203
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:43,129
Scott:  They'll say whatever you want, they think that they have to say to make you stop torturing them.

204
00:14:43,552 --> 00:14:48,910
Scott: They'll say, yes, I did it, he did it, they don't care, they'll make up anything, you won't know what's true and what's a lie.

205
00:14:49,410 --> 00:15:02,930
Scott: So the CIA doesn't wanna do torture, the NSA doesn't wanna do torture, no one who's actually in the interrogation business wants to torture because they know it's useless and stupid and wrong, and yet, Gonzalez says we should and it's okay.

206
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:05,669
Scott: This is a bad man, a very bad man.

207
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:20,030
Rym:  Well, he was at Georgetown University, and it's a school, obviously, and he was giving a little talk on a panel about the NSA spying and how it's a good thing, and people are worked up about it for no good reason.

208
00:15:20,732 --> 00:15:25,430
Rym: And in the middle of it, all these punk kids pull out a little bit of civil disobedience.

209
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:26,420
Scott:  Woot.

210
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:43,436
Rym:  And I don't know all the details because this is just some live journal post about it, but apparently they made a ruckus and then a whole bunch more of 'em stormed the room with a giant banner that has my favorite quote from Ben Franklin ever, "Those who would sacrifice liberty for security "deserve

211
00:15:43,517 --> 00:15:43,881
Rym: neither.".

212
00:15:44,731 --> 00:15:46,689
Rym: This huge friggin' banner and they held it up.

213
00:15:47,770 --> 00:16:01,302
Scott:  Actually, I think what it was is a bunch of them stood up and turned their backs to him, like, you know, he was giving a speech to a room full of people sitting facing towards him, so people standing up and facing away all in unison is kinda like, "Eh, what's goin'

214
00:16:01,443 --> 00:16:01,504
Scott: on?".

215
00:16:02,651 --> 00:16:09,290
Scott: And then kids all dressed in black with like little cowls on came in with the banner from an outside room.

216
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:15,649
Rym:  Oh, I just looked at it, they're wearing the outfit that the one, you know the famous picture of the Iraqi being tortured with the black hood on?

217
00:16:16,193 --> 00:16:17,009
Rym: They were wearing those.

218
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:17,674
Scott:  Ah.

219
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:22,128
Rym:  I didn't notice that, I was just lookin' at the picture in greater detail here.

220
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:27,429
Scott:  Yeah, so they came in like that, carrying this banner, and then they all unfurled it and held it, so.

221
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:28,153
Scott:  Now,

222
00:16:28,618 --> 00:16:43,562
Rym: once someone on the panel, well, I don't need to read all the quotes from the site because you have the same link I have, but David Cole, who was a professor, a law professor at this school after seeing this said, "In light of this, I'm proud of the very civil, "civil disobedience that was shown here

223
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:43,865
Rym: today.".

224
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,870
Scott:  Yay, civil, civil disobedience.

225
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:53,229
Rym:  So, my thing of the day was awesome, but Scott's, I gotta admit, is equally awesome in a completely different way.

226
00:16:53,690 --> 00:17:00,110
Scott:  This thing of the day, when I saw it this morning, I was like, oh my God, that is like one of the top 10 things of the day ever.

227
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:09,950
Rym:  Now, we're pretty sure that it was at least mostly staged just because the thing that they dug up in the desert, as far as we know, was ground up into bits before it was buried.

228
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,410
Scott:  Yeah, well, let me explain the whole story.

229
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,663
Scott: For those of you who don't know, there was an

230
00:17:13,865 --> 00:17:14,107
Scott: E.T.,

231
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,355
Scott: as in E.T.

232
00:17:15,395 --> 00:17:18,598
Scott: the extraterrestrial, the Steven Spielberg movie with, you know, E.T.

233
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:20,661
Scott: telefono la casa, I mean, E.T.

234
00:17:20,701 --> 00:17:21,189
Scott: phone home.

235
00:17:21,432 --> 00:17:23,790
Rym:  What is it with you in the Spanish version of that movie?

236
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:26,470
Scott:  They made us watch it in Spanish class in high school.

237
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,849
Rym:  We watched The Lion King in French.

238
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:29,835
Scott:  E.T.

239
00:17:29,876 --> 00:17:31,149
Scott: telefono la casa.

240
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:35,475
Scott: Anyway, so, they made a game for the Atari called

241
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:35,838
Scott: E.T.,

242
00:17:36,282 --> 00:17:45,630
Scott: based on the movie, and everyone says it was a terrible, terrible game, and you know what, it is a bad game, but I think it is slightly less terrible than everyone else thinks it is.

243
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,989
Rym:  See, have you actually played that fucker?

244
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:47,769
Scott:  Yes, I have.

245
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,830
Rym:  It's mostly unplayable.

246
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:54,669
Scott:  It is mostly unplayable, but it is slightly less terrible than everyone else says it is.

247
00:17:54,710 --> 00:18:01,169
Rym:  The cognitive dissonance between what I think I should be doing to win and what I actually need to be doing to win is immense.

248
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:08,175
Scott:  Anyway, it's a terrible game, and they thought they were gonna sell a hajillion copies of it 'cause it was so awesome, and E.T.

249
00:18:08,216 --> 00:18:13,570
Scott: was like the most popular thing in the world in that time, but they made more copies than there were Ataris.

250
00:18:14,792 --> 00:18:16,169
Scott: They just made too many copies of it.

251
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,049
Rym:  Millions of 'em didn't get sold.

252
00:18:18,911 --> 00:18:21,728
Scott:  Yeah, and the fact that it was a bad game didn't help it.

253
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,490
Scott: They didn't even sell a copy for every Atari.

254
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,510
Scott: Yet everyone with an Atari seems to have one.

255
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:27,529
Rym:  'Cause there's so many.

256
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:28,829
Scott:  I know, so-- - I have one.

257
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:29,394
Rym:  Yeah.

258
00:18:29,414 --> 00:18:30,349
Rym:  It's sitting right there.

259
00:18:31,191 --> 00:18:38,323
Scott:  So, what ended up happening is not only did they lose a shit ton of money, but all these extra E.T.

260
00:18:38,404 --> 00:18:42,869
Scott: for the Atari cartridges were put in a landfill, and we're pretty sure that they were ground up.

261
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,308
Scott: Nah, but we don't know that for sure.

262
00:18:46,352 --> 00:18:48,390
Scott: So, this band wrote a song.

263
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,989
Scott: There's just some band, I don't know who they are.

264
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:50,525
Scott: I don't care.

265
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:58,888
Scott: They made a song, and their music video was all about this Atari game, and it shows footage of them playing it.

266
00:19:02,676 --> 00:19:06,546
Scott: I like the parallel where it shows them digging up the landfill to get E.T.

267
00:19:06,587 --> 00:19:08,577
Scott: cartridges, and it shows E.T.

268
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:12,070
Scott: in the game going into a pit to collect a piece of his spaceship.

269
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:13,188
Rym:  Just watch it.

270
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:15,949
Rym: It's got really high production values, and it's really well done.

271
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,449
Scott:  Yeah, it's really cool.

272
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,566
Rym:  And it'll tell you in greater detail than we did the actual story of the E.T.

273
00:19:21,607 --> 00:19:21,890
Rym: cartridge.

274
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:26,224
Scott:  And if you are someone who already knows the story of the E.T.

275
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:29,630
Scott: cartridge, it will still entertain you and make you feel good.

276
00:19:31,892 --> 00:19:35,549
Rym: So, today being anime day, we have two anime to talk about.

277
00:19:35,831 --> 00:19:40,845
Rym: We're gonna take a look at Kagehime Monogatari A.Q.

278
00:19:41,026 --> 00:19:41,630
Rym: Ellis Rondo.

279
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:43,750
Rym: Most people just call it Kagehime.

280
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,310
Scott:  Yeah, that's the name that was on the torrent.

281
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:51,370
Rym:  Yeah, we only watched one episode, and suffice to say that's all we need to watch of that show.

282
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,350
Rym: We'll get into that in a minute.

283
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:58,610
Rym: And we're gonna talk about, we'll actually review Last Exile, which we're more than halfway through currently.

284
00:19:59,110 --> 00:19:59,868
Scott:  That's a good show.

285
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:09,029
Rym:  'Cause basically we've decided that in terms of the way we talk about anime, there are three types of discussions we're gonna have from this point on.

286
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,548
Rym: We'll try to be very clear about what they are.

287
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:15,790
Rym: Well, if we watch just like one episode, we're just gonna talk about our impressions of the show.

288
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,248
Rym: It's like a look or a preview or something like that.

289
00:20:19,211 --> 00:20:22,409
Rym: Once we've seen enough of the show to review it, we'll do a full-on review.

290
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:27,370
Rym: And then when we've seen the end of a show, we'll always do a sort of final thoughts.

291
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:28,489
Scott:  Well, if it's a good show.

292
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,610
Rym:  Yeah, if it's a show that's worth talking about.

293
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,389
Scott:  We're not gonna do final thoughts and something that was crap.

294
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:31,829
Scott:  Yeah.

295
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:35,510
Scott:  We're not even gonna do a review if the preview was, you know.

296
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,049
Rym:  Kagehime's not getting a review.

297
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:41,350
Scott:  That's a good way to tell how good we think a show is, is how many times we'll talk about it.

298
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:43,369
Rym: At most, we can talk about it three times.

299
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,670
Scott:  Yeah, and that would be like the best show in the world.

300
00:20:45,751 --> 00:20:46,728
Scott: we talk about three times.

301
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:58,770
Rym:  Now, the reason that we're splitting up the review and the final thoughts, just in case you're curious, is simply that we wanna have a review of the show that anyone can listen to, that won't ruin anything.

302
00:20:59,431 --> 00:21:05,269
Rym: But when we talk about a show that we've seen all of, we want to have the ability to spoil it so we can actually talk about it.

303
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:12,110
Scott:  So basically, the purpose of previewing a show is to know whether you should start watching it now or not.

304
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:23,230
Scott: The purpose of a review of a show is, you know, once enough of it is out, that's pretty much like, all right, is it a good show or is it a bad show after you've seen enough of it to make good judgment.

305
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:29,769
Scott: And you know, if you're really, you know about a show and you wanna know whether it's good or not, the review is what you're looking for.

306
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:34,350
Scott: And the final thoughts is like more of a discussion of the show itself.

307
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:41,849
Scott: So if you've already seen the show and you wanna hear us talk about why, what happened in the show in a nerdy discussion, that's what final thoughts is for.

308
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:46,949
Rym:  Yeah, and if you want a nice example of that, go back to the one we did about Big O2, the end of that one.

309
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:51,496
Rym: We ranted for like an hour about the existential blah, blah, blah.

310
00:21:51,516 --> 00:21:52,890
Scott:  Allegory, whatever.

311
00:21:53,933 --> 00:21:56,289
Scott: Yeah, I think we should do the same thing for, you know, video games and stuff.

312
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,790
Rym:  Yeah, I think that'll be our terminology from now on.

313
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,550
Rym: We'll probably make a post or a forum thing about it at some point.

314
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,130
Scott:  Yeah, board games don't really need that.

315
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,949
Scott: Board games, pretty much, you played it, you can talk about it, you know.

316
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:11,850
Rym:  Now, like we said, we'll talk about Kagehime first, and this is a first look or a preview.

317
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:15,230
Scott:  Right, so Kagehime was a pretty normal magical girl show.

318
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:18,729
Rym:  It looked like it had potential just based on the opener and the first little bit of it.

319
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:25,709
Scott:  Yeah, I mean, the girl had bunny ears and stuff, and there was a guy and another girl and whatever, and there was a school, I think, but the school didn't play into it so much.

320
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:28,410
Rym:  Yeah, it started out really kinda weird.

321
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:34,390
Scott:  And they had this really blatant Alice in Wonderland metaphor, but it was actually a big part of the show.

322
00:22:34,531 --> 00:22:42,150
Scott: They would just keep saying Alice, Alice, Alice, and they, you know, Looking Glass, and there were rabbits everywhere, and clocks and pocket watches.

323
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:55,030
Rym:  But it's actually quite literally, they're looking for, basically they're looking for the way to make the Lost Alice, or the Infinite Alice, which is the last book in the Alice in Wonderland series that was never written.

324
00:22:55,170 --> 00:23:00,610
Scott:  Yeah, 'cause it's Alice in Wonderland, then there's Alice in the Looking Glass, and there's some imaginary third book.

325
00:23:01,271 --> 00:23:03,728
Scott: So the point of the show is that they're trying to get the third book.

326
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:12,630
Rym:  Now, the show wouldn't have been that bad, 'cause I mean, I'm a man who sat through all of Sailor Moon, so I can take a magical girl show pretty handily.

327
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:18,769
Scott:  Yeah, I'm not a fan of magical girl shows, but I wouldn't mind watching Fancy Lala to find out what happens with those dinosaurs.

328
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:27,189
Rym:  Now, Akagi Hime wouldn't have been that bad, except that it had 100% more horrible rape than I expect from a magical girl show.

329
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,429
Scott:  Yeah, and it wasn't even a hentai, man.

330
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:30,548
Rym:  Oh my God.

331
00:23:32,213 --> 00:23:46,729
Rym: I'm not sure what to say other than that in the first five minutes of the first episode, the main character magical girl horribly rapes another magical girl with a giant key, and then the same thing happens again near the end of the episode.

332
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:47,850
Scott:  Yeah, we're not even joking.

333
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:58,889
Scott: Like, he takes this giant key, we're talking, like, Kingdom Hearts key, jams it into this girl's chest, and starts turning it, and the girl is just crying and whimpering as if she is being raped.

334
00:24:00,237 --> 00:24:04,170
Rym: I really don't know how to, it's like the most, it's horrible.

335
00:24:05,992 --> 00:24:12,589
Rym: We were watching it, and we're looking at each other, and we're like, this is just a rape scene that doesn't involve rape.

336
00:24:12,931 --> 00:24:14,409
Rym: It's just, I don't know what to say.

337
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:18,449
Scott:  There were some, there were even up skirts and boobage and everything, so it's kinda like, ugh.

338
00:24:19,031 --> 00:24:19,629
Scott: Made it even worse.

339
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:26,110
Scott: I mean, you thought like the man-loving, what was it, cluster edge is bad.

340
00:24:26,352 --> 00:24:27,469
Scott: That doesn't even come close.

341
00:24:27,913 --> 00:24:30,550
Scott: I would take that in a second over this key rape business.

342
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:31,408
Rym:  Oh my God.

343
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:31,799
Rym:  Yeah.

344
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:41,809
Rym:  I mean, it's still just a happy, cute, magical girl show, but all the magical girls, and there's a whole bunch of 'em, and they're all trying to get these pages of the book, and you know how they get the page of the book?

345
00:24:42,211 --> 00:24:52,709
Rym: First, they rape the other girl with the key in this horrible way, and then apparently a book pops out of their chest, and it's like their actual life story, like all their innermost secrets.

346
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,087
Rym: Then she flips through it, finds a piece she likes, rips it out, and takes it.

347
00:24:57,392 --> 00:24:59,183
Rym: Meanwhile, the other girl's screaming, "Please don't read my

348
00:24:59,224 --> 00:24:59,469
Rym: secret.".

349
00:25:00,034 --> 00:25:01,969
Rym: It's rape on every level that you can have rape.

350
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:08,230
Scott:  They should just call it rape-a-hime, or kage rape, or something.

351
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:09,650
Rym:  I mean, I wish I was kidding.

352
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,510
Rym: Don't fucking watch this show.

353
00:25:11,591 --> 00:25:12,370
Rym: It's just terrible.

354
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:17,349
Scott:  Unless you really, really like magical girls, or raping people with keys.

355
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,150
Scott:  Yeah.

356
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:19,410
Scott:  If you have a key rape fetish.

357
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:20,865
Rym:  I mean.

358
00:25:23,797 --> 00:25:24,810
Rym: We were a little taken aback.

359
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,030
Scott:  Yeah, so kage-hime, not good.

360
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:35,670
Rym:  Yeah, it's not, unless you wanna see what we're talking about, because the show is really kind of, Watch the first episode.

361
00:25:35,931 --> 00:25:36,770
Scott: Go ahead, be my guest.

362
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:40,390
Rym:  Yeah, 'cause you might be thinking, there's no way they're serious.

363
00:25:40,491 --> 00:25:43,322
Rym: There's no way there's actually rape in that cute magical girl show.

364
00:25:43,342 --> 00:25:44,290
Rym: that's not at all hentai.

365
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:44,800
Rym:  Oh.

366
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:45,710
Scott:  No, yeah.

367
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,869
Scott:  Oh, and it's not hentai, by the way, for real.

368
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,149
Scott:  Yeah, it's really not hentai.

369
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:51,710
Rym: Nothing bad is shown other than the horrible rape.

370
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:52,230
Scott:  Yep.

371
00:25:53,851 --> 00:25:58,850
Scott:  So, nothing bad is shown except the horrible rape.

372
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,489
Rym:  It's, yeah.

373
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:01,969
Scott:  I think that's enough of that.

374
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,689
Rym:  All right, I wanna talk about a real show now.

375
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:06,810
Scott:  Last Exile, it's on DVD now, all of it.

376
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,210
Scott: It's been out for a while, actually.

377
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,369
Scott: We're just slow in watching it.

378
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:13,810
Rym:  I mean, I hadn't really seen any of it until we started watching it recently.

379
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:20,150
Scott:  I hadn't seen the first DVD, and I knew it was good, but it always got put down on the list under other stuff.

380
00:26:20,271 --> 00:26:23,568
Scott: And then when I started watching Fullmetal Alchemist, I just had no time to watch this one.

381
00:26:24,411 --> 00:26:27,429
Scott: So, it fell by the wayside, and now we picked it up again.

382
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:30,390
Rym:  And I gotta say, it's regrettable that it fell by the wayside.

383
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,450
Rym: Last Exile is fairly awesome.

384
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,530
Scott:  It's damn awesome.

385
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,129
Scott: Holy crap, awesome.

386
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:42,829
Rym:  Pretty much, it has all the tidings of an A anime, of a good, engaging, solid show.

387
00:26:43,652 --> 00:26:45,330
Rym: It starts right away with a good plot.

388
00:26:45,751 --> 00:26:47,790
Rym: The plot makes sense, the plot's contiguous.

389
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:48,970
Scott:  The characters are good.

390
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:52,609
Rym: There are so many characters, and they're all fleshed out and unique.

391
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:58,530
Scott:  And it's not like those other animes we talked about recently, where you didn't get to know the characters, 'cause they were in it for two seconds.

392
00:26:59,271 --> 00:27:04,090
Scott: There's the right number of characters that you can know them all, and they're cool, most of them.

393
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:08,250
Rym:  And the thing is, even the characters you don't get to know they're still really fleshed out.

394
00:27:08,471 --> 00:27:14,829
Rym: There's this one character, you only see him three or four times in the whole show, at least as far as we've seen.

395
00:27:15,252 --> 00:27:21,486
Rym: And you don't know much about him, but he does things, and he's about as developed as that kind of character can be.

396
00:27:23,691 --> 00:27:33,630
Scott:  The thing is, the one thing that bothers me about the show is that it's so, it feels like someone wrote an RPG, and then decided they couldn't make an RPG and made an anime instead.

397
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:37,449
Rym:  The thing is, I kinda like that, 'cause it feels like an RPG.

398
00:27:38,173 --> 00:27:40,129
Rym: Oh, now they're playing the Getting Fish game.

399
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:44,448
Rym: Oh, now they're like, it's RPG anime style music, is through the whole thing.

400
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:54,789
Scott:  Well, it's good, because RPG plots tend to be good and enjoyable, and there's nothing more that I want than to get an RPG plot without actually having to push A a thousand times in the combat system.

401
00:27:55,750 --> 00:28:07,027
Scott: But at the same time, the parts of the show that are just so blatantly mini-game are a little bit, it's not painful, but it's a little twinge.

402
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,564
Scott: It's like, oh, RPG, it doesn't really fit in.

403
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,608
Rym:  I think, haha, RPG.

404
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:22,990
Scott:  Well, if they did it more blatantly, instead of this trying to be subtle, but not really, and they did it less often, I think it would be actually good.

405
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:26,309
Scott: It would add to the show, but the way it's done, it kinda minuses.

406
00:28:27,092 --> 00:28:33,310
Scott: One time they're having a race, oh, that's right, the show is about these kids who fly these things called Vanships.

407
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:39,468
Rym:  Well, basically, I'll say a bunch of words, and these words together really tell you what the show is about.

408
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:46,149
Rym: Steampunk, air pirates, that's all you need to know.

409
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:47,490
Rym: It's steampunk air pirates.

410
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:50,730
Scott:  Yeah, so basically they have these things called Vanships, Vanships, whatever.

411
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:56,469
Scott: They're basically fighter planes, but they look different and work on a principle of made-up fantasy.

412
00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:00,589
Rym:  Yeah, but it seems a lot like a helium-filled thing, or a hydrogen-filled thing.

413
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,970
Scott:  As far as you're concerned, it's just fighter pilots.

414
00:29:03,372 --> 00:29:04,090
Scott: It just looks different.

415
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:07,950
Rym:  It's got a lot of the same feeling that Crimson Skies does.

416
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:20,649
Scott:  So there's a scene where they're racing them, and it's just so blatant that someone wanted to have a racing minigame in the RPG, and there's another part where it's just real RPG, especially the music and stuff.

417
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:21,949
Rym:  Which is really cool.

418
00:29:22,571 --> 00:29:31,669
Rym: The only thing that bothers me in that aspect is that while the overarching plot is not at all predictable, as in I have no frickin' idea what's actually going on yet.

419
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:34,530
Scott:  Yeah, I mean, it's not that it's not predictable.

420
00:29:35,352 --> 00:29:37,230
Scott: It's that you don't have any information.

421
00:29:37,311 --> 00:29:38,589
Scott: You can't even follow it, really.

422
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:44,570
Rym:  But while the overarching plot is unknowable currently, but I don't feel bad about not knowing it, 'cause there's no way to know it.

423
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:45,630
Rym: I could just make crazy guesses.

424
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:51,162
Rym: Even though, honestly, the show's a lot like Scrap Princess, and I think it's gonna go the same way.

425
00:29:51,203 --> 00:29:53,389
Rym: Scrap Princess does, for anyone who's seen that.

426
00:29:53,852 --> 00:29:54,427
Rym: That's my guess.

427
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:59,490
Scott: But anyway-- - From what I know about Scrap Princess, I think that it's pretty true.

428
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,429
Rym:  Well, let me put it this way.

429
00:30:01,772 --> 00:30:08,710
Rym: I watched Scrap Princess while I was at RIT, basically on my computer, instead of doing a lab that I had to do to graduate.

430
00:30:09,511 --> 00:30:12,070
Rym: I graduated anyway, but barely.

431
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,190
Rym: But Scott didn't actually watch the show.

432
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:16,169
Rym: He just caught bits of it while I was watching it.

433
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:17,528
Scott:  I saw the first few episodes.

434
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:24,436
Rym:  Yeah, so when I said the show's a lot like Scrap Princess, Scott says, "Oh, so you mean the girl's gonna explode "or

435
00:30:24,477 --> 00:30:24,808
Rym: something?".

436
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:25,342
Scott:  Yeah.

437
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,910
Rym:  Yeah, so if you've seen Scrap Princess, I found that funny.

438
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:32,430
Scott:  'Cause it does seem like the girl's gonna explode in Last Exile, but we don't know yet.

439
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:33,108
Scott: We haven't finished it.

440
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:38,909
Rym:  But to get to my point, the individual plot points within the show are very predictable.

441
00:30:39,953 --> 00:30:45,129
Rym: It's very much the principle of, if you don't see someone die, they're not dead, but everyone's gonna think they're dead.

442
00:30:45,471 --> 00:30:49,110
Rym: That way you get to have all the character development of them dying, but yet you get to keep 'em around.

443
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:50,730
Scott:  They do that a lot.

444
00:30:50,951 --> 00:30:52,790
Scott: That's a mechanism a lot of animes use.

445
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:55,509
Rym:  It's one of those shows that gives you the sense of no one can die.

446
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:57,410
Rym: Like, everything's just always perfect.

447
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:58,930
Scott:  You know that people are gonna die.

448
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,130
Rym:  Yeah, but it's all gonna come in the end.

449
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:01,910
Scott:  If the series is good anime, someone always dies.

450
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:06,589
Rym:  Yeah, the thing is, we've picked out all the people we think are gonna die, and I think we're gonna be pretty accurate on that.

451
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:17,329
Rym: Like, one character, he's been kinda quiet for most of the show, and then he's about to do something awesome, and we looked at each other, and we praised each other and said, well, he just sealed his fate, and sure enough.

452
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,489
Scott:  Yep, we were just dead on.

453
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:24,330
Scott: That guy, but he was still cool the way he did it.

454
00:31:24,351 --> 00:31:24,870
Scott: He was awesome.

455
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:36,130
Rym:  Now, one thing that I really like is that the technical bits, like the ships and all the technology in this world is really well-drawn and well-defined and self-consistent.

456
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:37,899
Scott:  Oh yeah, it's very, like.

457
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,210
Scott: the consistency is really great.

458
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:48,610
Scott: You ever see like a racing show, and like every car, like F-Zero is a great example, where every car seems to be working on some different mechanical mechanism.

459
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:53,210
Scott: You know, it's like one has a giant engine sticking out the front, one has a rocket in the back.

460
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,429
Scott: You know, it's all different stuff.

461
00:31:55,091 --> 00:32:03,410
Scott: This one, it's like everything, you know, it seems like they have a consistent universe with a consistent laws of physics, and they all have the same kind of engine.

462
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:12,809
Scott: It's like, you even see this sort of flying propulsion mechanism on the Vanships, and then the giant capital ship, the Urbanus, has just a giant one sticking out of it.

463
00:32:13,212 --> 00:32:14,069
Scott: You know, it's pretty cool.

464
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:29,349
Rym:  Now, the really cool thing about that is they never come straight out and say how everything works, but throughout the show, they always show you like bits of when they're repairing something, or when they're talking to each other, and basically you figure out how this stuff all works throughout the course of the show.

465
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:43,848
Scott:  It's like, if you didn't know anything about cars, but you just sat in the mechanic's garage and watched him and listened to what he was saying, you know, you kinda eventually figure out, oh, so there's this internal combustion going on, you know?

466
00:32:44,431 --> 00:32:46,190
Scott: So, it's sort of like that thing.

467
00:32:46,471 --> 00:32:53,430
Scott: All the characters know how everything works, and they just talk to each other about stuff the way they normally would, as if they knew how it worked.

468
00:32:54,271 --> 00:32:56,089
Scott: And then, by listening to them, you figure it out.

469
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:05,887
Rym:  Now, one thing I gotta say is that, at first, because the individual plot point's very predictable, and I got the feeling that the love interest romance angle was gonna be predictable, too.

470
00:33:06,992 --> 00:33:08,029
Rym: Oh my god, it's not.

471
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,190
Scott:  No, no it wasn't.

472
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:18,669
Rym:  Basically, all the romance you think is going to happen, because that's what happens in any anime like this, not at all, it's all completely backwards, and everyone likes everyone else different, and it's complicated and awesome.

473
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:19,889
Scott:  Well, except for the one guy.

474
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:20,880
Scott:  No.

475
00:33:20,941 --> 00:33:22,589
Scott: (laughs) - The musketeer guy.

476
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:23,910
Rym:  Yeah, that guy's great.

477
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:29,128
Scott:  Actually, I thought he was the main character of the show, if you've never seen it before, 'cause he's the first one you see.

478
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:45,810
Rym:  Yeah, he's just this musketeer, because the show starts, we're in the middle of this conflict between two fleets in the sky, and they're fighting in a very chivalrous, like French-era Napoleon-style of two armies standing there, shooting muskets at each other, not moving.

479
00:33:47,172 --> 00:33:54,745
Rym: And it's really cool, but the main character, that you think is the main character, at least, is standing there, before the battle, just chanting to himself, "The bullets will pass me

480
00:33:54,806 --> 00:33:55,067
Rym: by.".

481
00:33:55,793 --> 00:33:56,681
Rym: "The bullets will pass me

482
00:33:56,721 --> 00:33:57,004
Rym: by.".

483
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:14,929
Scott:  And then later, he becomes a not-main character, but his big thing is he has these survival medals, 'cause he said that one in three musketeers dies in every battle, so after three battles, you're probably gonna die, yet he survived a whole shit-ton of 'em.

484
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:25,489
Rym:  Yeah, the show definitely has this whole chivalry, nobility, royalty, noble blood, we're going to talk about that in a metaphorical way, angle going to it.

485
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,070
Scott:  And it seems to be against the chivalry, very much.

486
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:35,150
Rym:  Well, it seems to be very much for honor and nobility, and very much against blood, nobility, and silliness.

487
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:41,829
Scott:  Yeah, 'cause it seems like they're trying to say, like, "Hey, look, this chivalry is pretty dumb, you know?

488
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:47,266
Scott: "Look at this, just people standing there, "shooting each other, just right out, it's really

489
00:34:47,327 --> 00:34:47,649
Scott: stupid.".

490
00:34:47,951 --> 00:34:50,005
Scott: And you say to yourself, "Yeah, that is really

491
00:34:50,045 --> 00:34:50,367
Scott: stupid.".

492
00:34:50,871 --> 00:34:59,603
Scott: But then they show you this war without chivalry, where there's lots of killing, and cannons, and people just cheating and killing each other, and you're like, "Oh, that's even

493
00:34:59,644 --> 00:34:59,926
Scott: worse.".

494
00:35:00,672 --> 00:35:06,410
Scott: But at the same time, it's not, because it's not, it's sort of less pointless, but more destructive.

495
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:21,789
Rym:  Now, I don't know how much more we can really say, 'cause like we said, we're trying to really avoid spoiling anything, and normally we could talk a lot about the plot of a show without spoiling it, but half of watching Last Exile is just figuring everything out on your own, and watching it unfold before you.

496
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:22,529
Rym: It's like an adventure.

497
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:24,528
Rym: It's like playing an RPG.

498
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:26,709
Scott:  Without having to push the buttons.

499
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:31,910
Rym:  Yeah, so I can't really say much, give you more information, other than just watch the show.

500
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:35,730
Rym: Last Exile is well worth watching, and I regret the fact that I hadn't seen it sooner.

501
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,170
Scott:  Yeah, if you haven't seen the show, get right on that.

502
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,810
Rym:  I mean, I've even got a little stuffed Lavi.

503
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,330
Rym: Lavi's the female protagonist.

504
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:47,450
Scott:  We got it for a dollar at an out of business media play.

505
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:52,570
Rym:  Yep, we went to media play the day before it went out of business for good, 90% off, and I got a little stuffed Lavi.

506
00:35:54,470 --> 00:36:00,430
Scott:  Okay, so there's this comic that I knew about for quite a while, I just didn't pick up, called Owly.

507
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:01,149
Rym:  Oh really?

508
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:02,270
Scott:  Yeah, really.

509
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,949
Scott: It's called Owly, O-W-L-Y.

510
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:05,630
Rym:  Oh really?

511
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,330
Scott:  Like a cute owl, yeah really.

512
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:16,670
Scott: So, I got it this week because there really weren't that many new comics this week, so I said, you know what, I can get something old, I'll get Owly.

513
00:36:17,231 --> 00:36:22,250
Scott: I got the first volume of Owly, which is called The Way Home and the Bittersweet Summer.

514
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:29,229
Scott: Oh, I guess those are the names of the two stories contained in it, and it's drawn and written completely by this one guy, Andy Runton.

515
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,970
Rym:  It's really light, quick reading.

516
00:36:31,151 --> 00:36:34,310
Rym: I flipped through it and read it in like two minutes while I was doing my laundry today.

517
00:36:34,711 --> 00:36:41,850
Scott:  Yeah, I read it on the train in like maybe five minutes, but that's 'cause I took my time and tried to absorb the insane amounts of cute.

518
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:48,270
Rym:  I don't know how to describe how cute, there is as much cute in this as there is rape in Kagehime.

519
00:36:49,110 --> 00:37:00,230
Scott:  No, no, I think the amount of cute in Owly would, in this one volume of Owly, it equals the amount of rape in the entire show of Kagehime, every single episode of it.

520
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:01,869
Rym:  Now, there's no dialogue in Owly.

521
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:04,490
Scott:  Well, there is dialogue, it's just very awesome dialogue.

522
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:07,270
Rym:  Yeah, instead of having words, there'll just be a little picture.

523
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:12,050
Scott:  So, for example, Owly meets up with Wormy.

524
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:14,250
Scott: Wormy's the best character, at least my favorite character.

525
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:14,968
Rym:  He's a little worm.

526
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,008
Scott:  He's really cute.

527
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:24,269
Scott: Like everything else in the comic, but Wormy is like, Owly's like, what happened to you?

528
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:27,949
Scott: He doesn't actually say what happened to you, but he's like, there's a question mark.

529
00:37:29,393 --> 00:37:37,548
Scott: And then, Wormy has speech bubbles, and there's like a picture of Wormy getting rained on, and his little dirt comb.

530
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:41,629
Rym:  Well, basically skip a bit to the actual, try to explain it better.

531
00:37:42,491 --> 00:37:45,310
Rym: Owly asks the worm where he's from, where he lives.

532
00:37:45,854 --> 00:37:51,028
Rym: And the way he says that is the speech bubble shows like, tree equals house, picture of a tree equals picture of a house.

533
00:37:52,011 --> 00:37:54,888
Rym: And then, Wormy's like, picture of a little mud hut equals house.

534
00:37:55,954 --> 00:37:56,630
Rym: And they're like, oh, okay.

535
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:02,550
Scott:  Yeah, it's like they don't actually use words in the speech bubbles, they just use pictures and symbols.

536
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:17,649
Scott: Like, instead of affirmative, they'll be like, an exclamation point, and you reading it just from the pictures, 'cause it's so, the art isn't really complicated, awesome art, but the way it's drawn is like, all the meaning comes across in the picture itself.

537
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:27,069
Scott: So the exclamation point, like, speaks, you know, just volumes and volumes of text about what the guy said, and you get the full meaning without actually having a word there.

538
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:28,770
Rym:  It's really cute and lighthearted.

539
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,028
Scott:  And if you're illiterate, you can still read it.

540
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:38,230
Scott: So the first story in Owly is about how Owly, well, he's this owl, and he's really cute, and he's the main character.

541
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:43,769
Rym:  You know, I would just like to say that, considering how simple it is, I don't think we should really go into a plot synopsis.

542
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,269
Scott:  You know how to do a plot synopsis?

543
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,744
Rym:  That would kind of ruin Owly.

544
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:50,067
Scott:  I guess, yeah.

545
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:53,070
Rym:  Even though it's fairly predictable, as one would expect.

546
00:38:54,551 --> 00:38:58,050
Scott:  All right, just, if you like cute.

547
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:05,829
Rym:  It's real cute, I enjoyed it, it was worth the, well, I didn't spend any money on it, it was worth the money Scott spent on it.

548
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:06,969
Scott:  That's for sure.

549
00:39:08,191 --> 00:39:14,770
Scott: I recommend, if you get it, and then share it with everyone, like little kids, parents, grandma.

550
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,629
Rym:  Honestly, I think this would be an excellent book for a small child.

551
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:19,510
Rym:  Yeah.

552
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:20,909
Rym:  It's also an excellent book for me.

553
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:22,650
Scott:  It's an excellent book for everybody.

554
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:24,748
Rym:  Unless you hate owls.

555
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:32,070
Rym: I mean, if you really hate owls, and worms, and little raccoon florists, you're not gonna like Owly.

556
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:34,570
Scott:  Yeah, if you don't like hummingbirds, you won't like Owly either.

557
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:37,630
Rym:  Oh, the hummingbirds, they're the best characters as far as I'm concerned.

558
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:43,170
Scott:  Nah, it's all about wormy, but the, if you don't like cute things, I think, I don't think you'll like Owly.

559
