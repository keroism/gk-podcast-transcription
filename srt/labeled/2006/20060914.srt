00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,200
Rym: It's Thursday September 14th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,428
Rym: We conclude origins week with how we got into atheism.

3
00:00:18,971 --> 00:00:20,007
Rym: Let's do this.

4
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,819
Scott: Today sucked now.

5
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,784
Rym: Why would today suck?

6
00:00:24,804 --> 00:00:25,809
Rym: I had a pretty good day today.

7
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:31,028
Scott: Well, I went to work and I played DDR at work as usual, but wait a minute.

8
00:00:31,068 --> 00:00:33,328
Rym: Wait a minute You already had a better day.

9
00:00:34,295 --> 00:00:41,008
Scott: and then after that I Went to do the finishing fixing of my parents computer.

10
00:00:41,048 --> 00:00:44,854
Scott: now That sucked ass.

11
00:00:45,255 --> 00:00:45,977
Scott: like you know how.

12
00:00:46,058 --> 00:00:59,653
Scott: if you do something for the first time like build a computer and you're learning all kinds of Stuff it's a lot of fun, but then if you do it again, and you're not learning anything It's just a pain in the ass You know because all I wanted to do is finish fixing it and get home But I couldn't.

13
00:00:59,774 --> 00:01:04,910
Scott: it just took so goddamn long like it took me from like three or four hours to do this stupid computer.

14
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:15,359
Scott: Uh, oh, yeah, but the worst part is nobody told me and I didn't know about ATX 2.0 power supply connectors.

15
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:25,369
Scott: apparently on newer 64-bit motherboards The ATX motherboard power connector has four more pins on it.

16
00:01:26,113 --> 00:01:31,426
Scott: So I was trying to put a new motherboard in an old case With an old power supply and it didn't work.

17
00:01:31,728 --> 00:01:38,670
Scott: No I had to go out to the store and buy a new case with a new style power supply to plug in the stupid.

18
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:41,598
Scott: Oh god Grumble grumble.

19
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:41,740
Rym: see.

20
00:01:41,760 --> 00:02:00,222
Rym: it just goes to show that while everything in computer consumer computing technology has increased exponentially in the past six years in terms of the Actual, you know standards or things you need or requirements or prerequisites for everything There's really no centralized repository of that information.

21
00:02:00,603 --> 00:02:02,570
Scott: it's mostly concerning the power supplies.

22
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:04,870
Scott: I mean everything else is sort of a no-brainer.

23
00:02:05,012 --> 00:02:06,429
Scott: You just match up the letters, you know.

24
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:10,229
Scott: You buy one part and you buy another part that has the same set of letters on it.

25
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,829
Scott: You know PCI Express card for a PCI Express slot on the motherboard, you know, you match it up.

26
00:02:16,311 --> 00:02:21,010
Scott: But for the power supplies, it's not obvious how many watts you need.

27
00:02:21,151 --> 00:02:27,990
Scott: It's not obvious which power supply you need, you know You can't tell like could I have bought one a hundred watts less and save money?

28
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,344
Scott: Could I you know or did I need the hundred watts more it?

29
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:41,870
Scott: It's very difficult to find that information and it depends on so many factors that it's quite difficult to calculate Especially since a lot of the information isn't available anywhere.

30
00:02:42,693 --> 00:02:47,630
Scott: So it kind of sucks, you know considering the power supply is such an important part of the computer.

31
00:02:48,072 --> 00:02:51,929
Rym: Well, the conventional wisdom was always to buy the largest power supply you could afford.

32
00:02:52,692 --> 00:02:56,924
Scott: Yeah, the problem with that now is that there are 1000 watt power.

33
00:02:56,944 --> 00:02:58,830
Scott: Yeah, there are stupid power supplies now.

34
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,010
Scott: I mean like pretty much if you're making a desktop computer.

35
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:12,110
Scott: I would say that like a four hundred and fifty to a five hundred and fifty watt power supply depending on how many drives and Stuff you have is going to be enough most of the time.

36
00:03:12,612 --> 00:03:16,870
Scott: But I see people now with like these seven hundred and fifty watt power supplies eight hundred watt.

37
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,753
Scott: It's crazy.

38
00:03:18,235 --> 00:03:25,669
Scott: and you know, especially if you don't want to pay for your electric bill, you know If you get a power supply, that's more than you can afford more than you need.

39
00:03:26,211 --> 00:03:31,910
Scott: Not only are you paying more for the power supply itself, but that's going to in the long run be relative little.

40
00:03:33,351 --> 00:03:37,030
Rym: Are you saying that the the power supply the larger wattage power supplies draw more power?

41
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:38,594
Scott: Well, it depends.

42
00:03:38,614 --> 00:03:39,076
Scott: they might.

43
00:03:39,156 --> 00:03:41,807
Scott: they might be shittier, you know, cuz a lot especially a lot.

44
00:03:41,907 --> 00:03:43,696
Rym: I'm just curious Do you know how that works?

45
00:03:43,736 --> 00:03:44,962
Rym: How about what a power supply does?

46
00:03:44,983 --> 00:03:46,410
Scott: Yeah, I know how it does.

47
00:03:46,531 --> 00:03:49,070
Scott: But if you plug more stuff into it, then it draws more power.

48
00:03:49,231 --> 00:03:58,352
Rym: If you don't plug more stuff into it, then it doesn't draw more power Alright, so in that case then why would be having a large power supply affect you negatively other than the fact that you spent a Lot of money on it?

49
00:03:58,473 --> 00:04:04,704
Scott: because it seems to me that like a lot of these power supplies with the incredibly large wattage numbers On them are sort of like.

50
00:04:04,804 --> 00:04:08,620
Scott: not, you know They're not like the high quality looking ones that you get in the.

51
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,554
Scott: you know, the the mean wattage numbers They look all shady.

52
00:04:12,754 --> 00:04:15,184
Rym: So you're saying that the cheap power supplies leak a bunch of power.

53
00:04:15,626 --> 00:04:18,629
Scott: Yeah, okay At least that's what it looks like to me.

54
00:04:19,011 --> 00:04:22,466
Scott: I really I really wish that someone would do some research on this.

55
00:04:22,486 --> 00:04:37,545
Scott: so we could you know like get a whole bunch of power supplies and get like an Intel machine an AMD machine and then like dual cores of each and then you know compare like which power supplies on which boards and how much power they draw and how much is needed.

56
00:04:37,605 --> 00:04:42,287
Scott: with like just keep adding hard Drives until the power supply goes down and see how many you could add.

57
00:04:42,508 --> 00:04:51,000
Rym: or you know You can look at the specs of say your processor and your hard drives and see how much power they draw and then Choose accordingly, but the problem is here.

58
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:52,567
Scott: if you do that is number one.

59
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,230
Scott: It's not obvious.

60
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,477
Scott: You have to actually do some work.

61
00:04:54,538 --> 00:04:56,650
Rym: Well - I'm pretty sure it's still there.

62
00:04:56,852 --> 00:05:04,750
Rym: I haven't looked at AMD's site in a long time But AMD used to have a large matrix that showed if you have this chip get a power supply at least this big.

63
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:06,821
Rym: Yeah, this chip get a power supply at least this big.

64
00:05:06,861 --> 00:05:08,028
Scott: thing is the video cards.

65
00:05:08,088 --> 00:05:10,270
Scott: nowadays Some of them need their own power.

66
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,897
Scott: some of them don't you know?

67
00:05:11,957 --> 00:05:19,939
Scott: some things draw a lot more than other things do like Some of the CD roms and DVD burners nowadays draw a lot more power than some other models.

68
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:29,249
Scott: and The other thing is a lot of power supplies lie sort of like how those monitors lie About their dot pitch and stuff like that.

69
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:36,769
Scott: There are a lot of power supplies out there that are lying and they just you know Put kind of budged up numbers on them because no one can actually call them on it.

70
00:05:37,672 --> 00:05:44,473
Rym: Yeah, I guess this is all you because I haven't even bothered looking at the current standards of computers because I'm not building my computer Until next year.

71
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:52,750
Rym: All I'm saying is that I if someone knows of a guy All you're saying is that you screwed up and you didn't buy what you needed.

72
00:05:53,254 --> 00:05:54,547
Scott: so I went to the store and bought one.

73
00:05:54,588 --> 00:06:03,608
Rym: but But I believe that's the gist of the story that Scott the computer expert bought the wrong component because they changed the technology without telling me You didn't look.

74
00:06:04,852 --> 00:06:07,570
Scott: Anyway, there needs to be a guide about power supply purchasing.

75
00:06:07,811 --> 00:06:11,969
Rym: Yeah, because because anyways is a valid deflection of the fact that you just you screwed up.

76
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:13,717
Scott: Are you trying to put this on me?

77
00:06:13,737 --> 00:06:14,942
Rym: because it was your fault.

78
00:06:15,062 --> 00:06:15,846
Scott: you would have screwed up.

79
00:06:15,926 --> 00:06:16,729
Scott: also you didn't know.

80
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:17,736
Scott: What do you mean?

81
00:06:17,796 --> 00:06:18,461
Scott: I would have looked.

82
00:06:18,843 --> 00:06:19,709
Scott: you didn't know.

83
00:06:20,372 --> 00:06:22,562
Rym: You didn't know I would have looked.

84
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,953
Rym: the thing is I haven't even looked at Motherboards in months.

85
00:06:26,354 --> 00:06:33,195
Rym: you didn't know that would have screwed you to now because when I realize every time I build a computer I do about a.

86
00:06:33,216 --> 00:06:34,461
Scott: but I wasn't building a computer.

87
00:06:34,501 --> 00:06:36,630
Scott: I was replacing a motherboard and a CPU.

88
00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:40,961
Rym: So the thing is you you did a computer upgrade without any planning.

89
00:06:41,282 --> 00:06:42,285
Scott: I had the plan.

90
00:06:42,305 --> 00:06:45,535
Rym: apparently it was a shitty plan Doesn't matter.

91
00:06:45,555 --> 00:06:47,261
Rym: your plan was by component.

92
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:47,943
Rym: that won't work.

93
00:06:48,345 --> 00:06:49,689
Rym: bitch about it on GeekNights.

94
00:06:53,857 --> 00:07:00,800
Rym: Yeah, you know you give me a hard time when you give me a hard time like if I see something on the internet five Minutes after you do.

95
00:07:00,961 --> 00:07:11,630
Rym: Yeah, that's right Even though Yesterday and this is a total aside before we do the news, but Scott is Laughing at his computer, and he turns to me.

96
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,898
Rym: He says did you see this guy?

97
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:17,230
Rym: and I are see you hacked himself with the loopback address?

98
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:23,090
Rym: And I looked at him and I said Scott that was on bash.org like six years ago.

99
00:07:23,251 --> 00:07:24,958
Scott: I wasn't on bash.org six years.

100
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:27,167
Rym: That was all over the internet six years ago.

101
00:07:27,207 --> 00:07:30,039
Rym: That is You want to talk about old news.

102
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:32,830
Rym: that is like the oldest thing fuck ever.

103
00:07:33,492 --> 00:07:34,435
Scott: I wasn't in that crowd.

104
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:35,599
Scott: I didn't see that kind of stuff.

105
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,068
Scott: I was like I was like six months too late for that.

106
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:47,010
Scott: yes Like when that came out I was still playing like you know one player games at my computer.

107
00:07:48,371 --> 00:07:56,639
Rym: Anyway to use Scott's deflection anyway to move on to our news We got one awesome news and one news that'll just piss you off And I'll do the piss off news first.

108
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,470
Rym: okay as I found out about this just now.

109
00:07:59,631 --> 00:08:04,907
Rym: Now the I'm not gonna go over the exact details because you probably don't care which senator did what or who.

110
00:08:05,088 --> 00:08:06,230
Rym: what's going on specifically?

111
00:08:06,371 --> 00:08:19,810
Rym: But great the gist of the story is that the FCC commissioned a study with taxpayer money to figure out if a Concentration of media ownership would harm local content and harm local markets.

112
00:08:20,331 --> 00:08:30,218
Rym: Because the FCC for a while has been trying to change the rules to let fewer companies own more TV and radio stations Or and newspapers and all the base.

113
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,730
Scott: It's so clear Channel and News Corp and all them.

114
00:08:32,938 --> 00:08:34,655
Rym: Yeah Basically it would allow Turner.

115
00:08:34,977 --> 00:08:38,710
Rym: it would allow the number of companies that run the major media in the u.s.

116
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,246
Rym: To be consolidated even further.

117
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:47,007
Rym: Monopoly I mean currently I don't remember the numbers, so I'm gonna make one up, but it's the last thing I remember.

118
00:08:47,048 --> 00:08:53,126
Rym: reading was that Effectively, I think five companies controlled 95% of the media in the u.s..

119
00:08:53,206 --> 00:08:54,269
Scott: The mass media at least.

120
00:08:54,289 --> 00:08:58,903
Rym: yeah TV radio newspapers yeah, not counting pirate radio or anything.

121
00:08:59,004 --> 00:09:07,030
Rym: not counting pirate radio not counting internet Just you know, but anyway the point is the FCC commissioned this study in order to you know find out if this would be harmful.

122
00:09:08,132 --> 00:09:19,828
Rym: When the draft of the study came back, and they discovered that the study said yes It would be harmful their answer was to stop funding the study and then destroy all copies of it all right now.

123
00:09:19,848 --> 00:09:22,396
Scott: all right Obviously number one.

124
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:26,070
Scott: I'm against destroying information of any sort if possible.

125
00:09:26,492 --> 00:09:27,596
Rym: I have a much simpler point.

126
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:33,743
Rym: the FCC is supposed to be doing the common good And it seems like they're not doing the common good.

127
00:09:33,763 --> 00:09:35,069
Rym: They're doing their agenda.

128
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:36,749
Scott: well That's obvious also.

129
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:46,178
Scott: But here's the thing if you just want you know if you already know what you want to do And you just want to create evidence Why fund a real study?

130
00:09:46,238 --> 00:09:48,870
Scott: why not just write something that looks like you want to know why?

131
00:09:49,191 --> 00:09:56,569
Rym: Because when the FCC has been trying to pull some of these shenanigans recently Congress has been saying no Good, they're doing their job.

132
00:09:56,851 --> 00:09:57,755
Rym: So the episode.

133
00:09:57,956 --> 00:10:03,763
Rym: so the FCC wanted evidence and when the evidence wasn't there Hey, you just got rid of it and swept it under the rug.

134
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:04,869
Rym: now the cool thing is.

135
00:10:05,573 --> 00:10:19,230
Rym: The only reason we know about this is because someone in the FCC who was disgruntled Sent a copy of the study along with all of this stuff to senator Barbara Boxer Who you may remember for periodically being very awesome and periodically being crazy.

136
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:32,084
Rym: Yeah, one of those half-and-half senators She is one of the few senators who seems to actually at least stand up for what she believes in regardless of what people pay Her to say yep, that's pretty much it, but yeah There's not much more to it than that.

137
00:10:32,346 --> 00:10:37,108
Rym: the FCC Commissioned to study the study didn't say what they liked so they destroyed the study and tried to pretend it never happened.

138
00:10:37,128 --> 00:10:43,770
Scott: all I'm gonna Say is I hope that disgruntled guy gets transferred to other federal agencies and disgruntled all of them.

139
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,060
Rym: I hope that disgruntled guy becomes president.

140
00:10:46,201 --> 00:10:46,784
Scott: that too.

141
00:10:47,085 --> 00:10:48,914
Scott: He should be the president He should be like.

142
00:10:48,974 --> 00:10:50,240
Scott: I'm the disgruntled guy.

143
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:50,802
Scott: vote for me.

144
00:10:51,164 --> 00:10:51,787
Scott: I'm disgruntled.

145
00:10:51,847 --> 00:10:52,410
Scott: I'll vote for you.

146
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:54,291
Scott: Everyone.

147
00:10:54,311 --> 00:10:55,455
Scott: vote for disgruntled gay.

148
00:10:55,917 --> 00:10:59,410
Rym: now of course you know politics, and you know our actual lives.

149
00:10:59,652 --> 00:11:02,110
Rym: That's not real news the real news that the Wii was announced.

150
00:11:08,215 --> 00:11:12,542
Scott: So Last night at least last night in the US.

151
00:11:12,743 --> 00:11:17,390
Scott: It was like 2 p.m.. In Japan They had the Japanese Wii press conference.

152
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:27,335
Rym: If you have read the coverage of the Wii thing I suggest now that you read it again because all of the preliminary Reports were mostly horseshit.

153
00:11:27,736 --> 00:11:36,147
Rym: Yeah, well no the only preliminary port that there was a all the ones I saw were like it's gonna come with two emotes, and it's gonna be.

154
00:11:36,408 --> 00:11:37,592
Scott: well Here's what happened.

155
00:11:37,713 --> 00:11:48,670
Scott: is the New York Times had an article ready because they had the inside scoop because that the New York Times and The information in the New York Times article was not all of the information.

156
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:58,069
Scott: But the information in it was correct And they put it out a little bit early and then in the Seattle newspaper Picked it up and put it online a little bit early.

157
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:21,270
Scott: So everyone knew the price and the release date of November 19th and the price of $250 early Before the press conference, but anyway the Japanese press conference is at 2 p.m.. In Japan last night Which it's gonna be 2 p.m.. In Japan pretty soon from the recording time of this and They're getting it on December something like December 2nd or something like that.

158
00:12:21,431 --> 00:12:28,810
Scott: I forget I don't have the date in front of me for all about the same price and All I got to say is wow we get it first pun.

159
00:12:29,412 --> 00:12:41,174
Rym: It seems one that all of the companies are kind of focusing much more on America than Japan Which is understandable from an economic perspective because the gaming market in America is Freaking massive

160
00:12:41,535 --> 00:12:41,795
Scott: yep,

161
00:12:42,397 --> 00:12:47,590
Rym: though it still surprises me that Sony turned their back on probably their most loyal fans.

162
00:12:48,272 --> 00:13:00,320
Scott: Well, I think what Nintendo's starting to realize is that you know they support Japan so well with a whole mess of games and a Whole mess of everything and America gets the shaft And that's why they don't kind of go with the Nintendo.

163
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:02,710
Scott: well whereas the PlayStation and the Xbox get like these.

164
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,674
Scott: You know gets the shaft Europe You're every.

165
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:11,270
Rym: all three companies gave Europe the big finger and said hey, you'll get our system someday.

166
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,262
Scott: Well everyone else gets the major shaft no matter what like the whole.

167
00:13:14,764 --> 00:13:16,430
Scott: think about the people in South Africa.

168
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,397
Scott: Are they getting Xbox 360s now?

169
00:13:18,918 --> 00:13:20,283
Scott: think about that or then?

170
00:13:20,303 --> 00:13:22,370
Rym: There's the people in Brazil are playing their master systems.

171
00:13:22,711 --> 00:13:23,574
Scott: Yeah way to go.

172
00:13:23,674 --> 00:13:27,689
Scott: master systems and Sega Genesis in Brazil and Sega Saturns possibly so.

173
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:33,729
Rym: anyway I'm sure many of you probably haven't but we're not gonna rattle off all the informations.

174
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,276
Rym: But the relevant bits.

175
00:13:35,637 --> 00:13:36,521
Scott: yeah the relevant bits.

176
00:13:36,742 --> 00:13:38,027
Scott: it comes with Wii Sports.

177
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:52,749
Rym: hooray I think this is a great move on Nintendo's part, but one now when it's sitting in the store and Mother who just now found out she can't get a PlayStation 3 sees that that Nintendo thing is real cheap And it comes with a game.

178
00:13:53,011 --> 00:14:00,789
Scott: Yep, the other thing is I was kind of on the edge about Wii Sports because it looked like it wasn't much of a game But I kind of wanted it you know.

179
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:04,130
Scott: But I didn't really think that it was gonna be worth paying out.

180
00:14:04,231 --> 00:14:06,730
Scott: You know a game price for it like not even 30 bucks.

181
00:14:06,831 --> 00:14:19,652
Scott: It was maybe worth 20 bucks from what I had seen but they added bowling and boxing to it, which is awesome because I guarantee bowling is gonna be the most fun and They're giving it away with the system, so it's like hooray That's just what I wanted.

182
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:22,480
Rym: it also resets a precedent that has long disappeared.

183
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,049
Rym: Consoles don't come with games anymore.

184
00:14:25,372 --> 00:14:25,755
Scott: Well they.

185
00:14:25,896 --> 00:14:29,078
Scott: what happens is they do come with games But not at the original release.

186
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:37,110
Scott: like the GameCube didn't come with a game at release But then eventually they had like buy the GameCube that comes with Wind Waker buy the GameCube that comes with Metroid Prime.

187
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,999
Scott: Yeah, the GameCube that comes with bongos.

188
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,470
Scott: You know like the n64 they did the same thing.

189
00:14:41,691 --> 00:14:50,209
Scott: There was the n64 that came with nothing and later on there was the n64 that came with Pokemon Stadium And the one that came with Donkey Kong 64 and all that stuff.

190
00:14:50,812 --> 00:14:54,710
Rym: But like none of the modern says this is the only system now that comes with a game.

191
00:14:55,152 --> 00:14:59,310
Scott: Yeah, they really should bring and it comes with a controller and a nunchuck.

192
00:14:59,772 --> 00:15:01,619
Scott: They really just need to throw a memory card.

193
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:04,030
Scott: I mean and all that stuff in there be cool.

194
00:15:04,794 --> 00:15:06,021
Rym: Yeah, I think they comes with enough.

195
00:15:06,062 --> 00:15:07,430
Rym: it comes with more than I expected.

196
00:15:07,913 --> 00:15:10,510
Scott: It definitely comes with a lot and I hear it's gonna be profitable.

197
00:15:10,691 --> 00:15:13,790
Scott: So I think what they did is they put in as many accessories and stuff as they could.

198
00:15:14,273 --> 00:15:16,749
Scott: Without you know, we'll still keeping a profit going.

199
00:15:17,063 --> 00:15:27,287
Rym: Yep Now the actual we modes are kind of pricey, but they're not more expensive than like Xbox 360 wireless controllers by far Yeah, and you know, you're gonna have to buy them eventually.

200
00:15:27,367 --> 00:15:31,020
Scott: So whatever now here's some other good really crazy news.

201
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:43,410
Scott: the the GameCube version of Zelda Twilight Princess is gonna come out like a week before The Wii and when the Wii comes out the Wii version of Zelda Twilight Princess will come out at the same time.

202
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:51,832
Rym: This is in my opinion while it is somewhat evil like it pisses me off like goddamn you but it's brilliant I can.

203
00:15:51,912 --> 00:15:53,979
Scott: uh, it's a brilliant move of business.

204
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:57,190
Scott: because the thing is who's gonna buy the GameCube Zelda?

205
00:15:57,551 --> 00:16:02,070
Scott: Why would you buy that when you can get the Wii one and you're probably the Wii is backwards compatible.

206
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,298
Scott: So why you know so many people?

207
00:16:04,378 --> 00:16:07,609
Scott: everyone is a GameCube is gonna get away, you know, eventually I'm pretty sure.

208
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:11,146
Scott: So, you know who's gonna buy that GameCube Zelda?

209
00:16:11,187 --> 00:16:11,850
Scott: not many people.

210
00:16:12,011 --> 00:16:19,119
Scott: Well, if they can get it a week before they can get the Wii one a whole week They might do it because you could beat that game in a week.

211
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:19,682
Scott: Probably.

212
00:16:20,043 --> 00:16:28,267
Rym: Yeah, you couldn't do everything in the game I thought I saw but dedicated number of fans buying it or the GameCube beating it and then not right.

213
00:16:28,328 --> 00:16:33,410
Rym: not buying the new Zelda game again for the Wii right away, but buying it used later.

214
00:16:33,985 --> 00:16:55,270
Scott: Yeah I see a lot of people buy the GameCube one play it when they get a Wii they'll put it in the Wii because they Backwards compatibility and continue playing it and then like way in the future because there's no way that There's not going to be a point in history in the future of this world where that is, you know before Armageddon where you will not be able to get a copy of Zelda Twilight Princess.

215
00:16:55,451 --> 00:16:58,350
Scott: Yeah, I mean it's not gonna be a hard game to get ever.

216
00:16:58,973 --> 00:17:01,304
Scott: You can go to the store and buy Wind Waker now for like 10 15 20 bucks.

217
00:17:02,531 --> 00:17:05,809
Scott: So you can go to the store and get Twilight Princess at any time.

218
00:17:06,353 --> 00:17:09,900
Rym: Now the other interesting bit was that it looks like Unless Sony.

219
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,029
Rym: he drops the ball again.

220
00:17:11,411 --> 00:17:14,912
Rym: The Wii is going to come out a few days after the PlayStation 3.

221
00:17:14,912 --> 00:17:18,102
Scott: I am still not confident the PlayStation 3 is gonna come out.

222
00:17:18,463 --> 00:17:20,589
Scott: Oh me either but few days before the Wii.

223
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,150
Rym: I wonder what Nintendo's motivation is.

224
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:28,550
Rym: I can think of a lot of ideas as to why they're choosing to do it that way and they all seem plausible.

225
00:17:28,953 --> 00:17:31,670
Rym: But I wonder what Nintendo's thinking because they're not stupid.

226
00:17:32,192 --> 00:17:36,090
Scott: Well, I think what it is is because they're focusing on the US where they're gonna release most of their systems.

227
00:17:36,612 --> 00:17:43,561
Scott: They want to make sure that they get all the systems they can to the US, you know That's that's why they're going there first and also because the US.

228
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:45,630
Scott: you have a thing called Thanksgiving which they don't have.

229
00:17:46,091 --> 00:17:51,588
Scott: you know in Japan a Black Friday and all that and then at least not the way Americans have it right.

230
00:17:51,768 --> 00:17:57,890
Scott: and then You know a few weeks later, they're gonna go to Japan with all the rest of the systems, you know.

231
00:17:58,492 --> 00:18:02,910
Scott: Like if they don't have enough it might be okay to shortchange Japan a little but I think they'll have enough.

232
00:18:03,052 --> 00:18:13,470
Rym: well, there's also and people in slashdot have been talking about this and it seems Plausible and in the very least even if it wasn't intentional the effect will probably happen nonetheless.

233
00:18:14,031 --> 00:18:30,900
Rym: but if there are well if when there are widespread ps3 shortages and Many many people go to the store before Christmas trying to buy the new PlayStation 3 for their kid and they can't get one And then they see the Wii they hear.

234
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,389
Rym: Oh that Nintendo system came out just now.

235
00:18:33,832 --> 00:18:35,101
Rym: Hey, those are in the stores.

236
00:18:35,161 --> 00:18:36,209
Rym: I can get one of those.

237
00:18:36,892 --> 00:18:37,795
Scott: Yeah, huh?

238
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,489
Scott: Who knows all I'm saying is it's pre-order time.

239
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,277
Scott: Everyone pre-order you ease.

240
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:44,578
Rym: Yep.

241
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:51,054
Rym: It also might have the effect of the PlayStation 3 comes out There's the press frenzy because you know The system actually comes out.

242
00:18:51,656 --> 00:18:57,974
Rym: then the Wii comes out the PlayStation press disappears because now the Wii is the hot press It could be.

243
00:18:57,994 --> 00:19:00,661
Rym: that is I think is what Nintendo's intention is.

244
00:19:00,902 --> 00:19:05,239
Rym: or the other possibility that someone posited on slashdot And FARC do different people.

245
00:19:05,259 --> 00:19:16,939
Rym: I'm pretty sure was that Nintendo is Confident that the PlayStation 3 is going to ship is going to slip its shipping date and as a result They'll get the announcement of wait.

246
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,910
Rym: Why is Nintendo going after the PlayStation then later?

247
00:19:20,431 --> 00:19:21,997
Rym: Oh, no, the PlayStation slipped.

248
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:24,950
Rym: now the Nintendo is coming out first and they get more press as a result.

249
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:28,394
Scott: Yeah, that's my that's my guess right there There's no way.

250
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:29,196
Scott: I mean, come on.

251
00:19:29,216 --> 00:19:33,670
Scott: There's no way the ps3s are gonna show up with games to play in November.

252
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:38,202
Rym: I mean yet anyone ever reported if the finalized dev kit ever got out.

253
00:19:38,402 --> 00:19:41,350
Scott: Yeah, it's like what no one's finished a PlayStation game.

254
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,444
Scott: No, it's like what are they gonna do?

255
00:19:43,927 --> 00:19:44,350
Scott: What do you think?

256
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:55,290
Scott: I mean, they've got working wheeze that they're traveling around the world with you know had letting people play As anyone played a PlayStation 3 other than a game developer or a Sony employee anyone.

257
00:19:56,411 --> 00:19:57,135
Scott: There's no way.

258
00:19:57,255 --> 00:19:59,767
Scott: I mean, I just don't believe that they could have it.

259
00:19:59,807 --> 00:20:07,630
Rym: from what I've read They were pretty much done Testing the Wii itself and they've been testing the controllers and making sure the controllers are perfect for a long time now.

260
00:20:07,911 --> 00:20:12,690
Scott: Yeah, they've been spending like months and months just honing and not you know developing.

261
00:20:12,831 --> 00:20:19,670
Rym: It seems like the PlayStation 3 is spending the rest of this time Developing and not so much the honing not so much with the honing.

262
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:29,709
Scott: No, I mean, of course, I did hear one rumor that the Wii is gonna ship with like a firmware update disc, you know but You know, that's a good idea.

263
00:20:29,971 --> 00:20:34,209
Scott: Well, it's like, you know you buy and then you put this disc in it to get it updated right away.

264
00:20:35,352 --> 00:20:36,969
Rym: That is a good idea for a lot of.

265
00:20:36,989 --> 00:20:42,050
Scott: well No What it means is that they didn't have time to flash them first and that you have to flash it when you buy it.

266
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,429
Scott: So they threw a disc in every box.

267
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:50,907
Rym: Well, what it also means is that they anticipate minor tweaks coming up But they didn't want to push back the date and they came up with a fairly elegant solution to that.

268
00:20:51,148 --> 00:20:55,970
Rym: Yeah Whatever, I mean better than forcing a download or something unreliable.

269
00:20:56,432 --> 00:20:57,437
Scott: Yeah, cuz a lot of be.

270
00:20:57,497 --> 00:21:05,691
Scott: I mean the Wii is gonna be all about the connecting to the Internet's but a lot of people aren't gonna connect theirs to the internet because you don't know how they can't even get their wireless laptop to Work.

271
00:21:05,851 --> 00:21:07,055
Rym: and that's one thing about Nintendo.

272
00:21:07,075 --> 00:21:11,470
Rym: They'll always do, you know, they'll try new things and they'll do interesting things like that.

273
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:16,350
Rym: You know the internet access, but they always make sure to take care of all of their fans.

274
00:21:16,731 --> 00:21:26,349
Scott: Yeah, so even if you don't use all the stuff you're taking care of You know a lot of people out there with DS is playing one-player games not using Wi-Fi not using nothing.

275
00:21:33,562 --> 00:21:40,941
Rym: Anyway things of the day Since we don't want to go too in-depth on the Wii and since Rym forgot to put the things of the day in the show Yesterday.

276
00:21:40,961 --> 00:21:41,503
Scott: Yeah.

277
00:21:41,663 --> 00:21:43,889
Rym: Well, the thing is because we had a guest on the show Emily.

278
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:49,880
Rym: I Guess but we hadn't had a guest in a while.

279
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,876
Rym: So I forgot to take that little thing of the day wave and stick it in the middle.

280
00:21:53,158 --> 00:21:53,540
Scott: Good job.

281
00:21:54,143 --> 00:21:57,480
Rym: So as a result, I'm going to put yesterday's things of the day one.

282
00:21:58,142 --> 00:22:02,159
Rym: It'll be in the archive when we eventually release, you know season one of GeekNights.

283
00:22:02,803 --> 00:22:10,296
Rym: eventually, I'm gonna re-fix the episode and Additionally, I'm going to put the things of the day as a special probably this weekend.

284
00:22:10,899 --> 00:22:10,959
Scott: Mmm.

285
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:16,798
Rym: Anyway, we do have things today for today and because they're part of the main bit There is no way they will not be in the show.

286
00:22:17,321 --> 00:22:21,634
Rym: hooray, and mine is also very very quick and somewhat relevant at the topic at hand now.

287
00:22:22,497 --> 00:22:27,098
Rym: a while ago in Afghanistan a soldier an American soldier was killed.

288
00:22:28,022 --> 00:22:38,200
Rym: this American soldier happened to be a member of the Wicca religion and As he was dead his family and as he had wished wanted a pentacle on his military tombstone.

289
00:22:39,681 --> 00:22:43,033
Rym: There was all sorts of rabble rousing by people who said you can't do that.

290
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:44,780
Rym: You can't put that on there.

291
00:22:45,622 --> 00:22:50,306
Rym: it's not an official recognized symbol and There was a shitstorm and then it disappeared.

292
00:22:50,386 --> 00:22:53,780
Scott: atheists have a symbol Wicca's can have a six have a symbol.

293
00:22:54,101 --> 00:23:04,880
Rym: yeah, there are I think 32 symbols that are recognized by the military and Just now now they haven't agreed to put it on the actual tombstone yet as far as I can tell but that's coming.

294
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:07,625
Rym: but his memorial plaque is art.

295
00:23:07,665 --> 00:23:08,307
Rym: they're putting the.

296
00:23:08,327 --> 00:23:15,301
Rym: in fact, they already made it a Glad.

297
00:23:15,382 --> 00:23:21,118
Rym: like every every now and then I get angry about how annoying politics are in this country America and how things are going.

298
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:27,260
Rym: and Whenever I get frustrated like that, it's always nice that at least every now and then someone does something right or something smart.

299
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:35,759
Scott: Yeah, they let us win those small into consequential Inconsequential completely meaningless battles when we lose all the actual meaningful ones.

300
00:23:36,522 --> 00:23:37,164
Rym: It's something.

301
00:23:37,465 --> 00:23:38,087
Rym: it's something.

302
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,560
Scott: it's something that doesn't really matter except, you know, you know what it meant.

303
00:23:42,543 --> 00:23:56,060
Rym: I've always noticed that the American military Throughout history has always been in many ways much more progressive than society in general I mean when it came to blacks during, you know after the Civil War and during segregation.

304
00:23:56,602 --> 00:24:00,074
Rym: The military is one of the first organizations to say we need soldiers.

305
00:24:00,134 --> 00:24:01,218
Rym: I don't care what color you are.

306
00:24:01,258 --> 00:24:01,760
Rym: Here's a gun.

307
00:24:02,383 --> 00:24:10,420
Scott: Well, the military is sort of like, you know You can look at it if you want the American military as like the experiment for American society.

308
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:18,725
Scott: It's like where they try shit out before they let they try it on the real people, you know They try out all our other real people like yeah It's like the the internet.

309
00:24:19,248 --> 00:24:26,320
Scott: they made the internet and then they gave it to the citizens and then you know They may they let black people in and then they let the black people in in the regular society.

310
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,736
Scott: It's like they see how shit works in the in the military.

311
00:24:28,756 --> 00:24:30,800
Rym: I Think it's much more simple.

312
00:24:31,187 --> 00:24:41,173
Rym: I think Many of the people in the military by nature of their job are very pragmatic and practical when it comes to doing Whatever works in a situation supposed to give a reasonable explanation.

313
00:24:41,193 --> 00:24:42,176
Scott: You're supposed to give a funny one.

314
00:24:42,196 --> 00:24:42,758
Scott: What's wrong with?

315
00:24:42,778 --> 00:24:43,726
Rym: alright fine You know what?

316
00:24:43,969 --> 00:24:44,739
Rym: Here's the funny bit.

317
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:53,018
Rym: I'm gonna join the military and die somewhere in some hellhole Just so a flying spaghetti monster can be on my tombstone damn straight.

318
00:24:53,138 --> 00:24:55,189
Rym: Okay So what do you got?

319
00:24:55,209 --> 00:24:55,250
Rym: so?

320
00:24:57,981 --> 00:25:03,263
Scott: You know the kind of music with like the surf the Japanese surf guitar and the flute, you know You get the.

321
00:25:03,766 --> 00:25:05,132
Scott: you know what that sound of music.

Scott: that then I do.

323
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:06,136
Rym: I don't know.

324
00:25:06,156 --> 00:25:08,505
Scott: if our listeners do Well, you're gonna listen to it.

325
00:25:08,525 --> 00:25:26,340
Scott: cuz my thing of the day some guy the great Japanese guitarist Takeshi Terayuchi and his band the bunnies have played many many classical Melodies with the Japanese surf guitar of awesome.

326
00:25:27,323 --> 00:25:30,574
Scott: It's sort of like, you know, if some guy to you know, does a bunch of rock versions.

327
00:25:30,634 --> 00:25:32,280
Scott: This guy did surf guitar versions.

328
00:25:33,501 --> 00:25:38,137
Scott: It's way cool and there's a lot of songs and they're all free mp3 downloads that are legitimate.

342
00:26:03,683 --> 00:26:04,390
Scott: I'll bet on it.

343
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:06,726

345
00:26:11,064 --> 00:26:12,027

346
00:26:12,147 --> 00:26:13,090
Scott: No, I'm not.

347
00:26:13,451 --> 00:26:13,933
Rym: Oh, okay.

348
00:26:13,953 --> 00:26:16,460
Scott: He's got the fur Elise on here and saber dance.

349
00:26:17,003 --> 00:26:17,647
Scott: It's good stuff.

350
00:26:17,707 --> 00:26:18,533
Scott: You should listen to it.

351
00:26:18,633 --> 00:26:19,619
Scott: It's awesome free music.

352
00:26:20,001 --> 00:26:24,917
Rym: But actually if you you all have heard the saber dance when you hear it, you'll go.

353
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:25,800
Rym: Oh, it's that song.

354
00:26:26,444 --> 00:26:28,800
Scott: Yeah, that's generally how a lot of classical songs are.

355
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:35,265
Scott: It's like, you know people hear it like someone will go And you'll go.

356
00:26:35,587 --> 00:26:39,007
Scott: I fucking know that song and you'd be like, yeah What song is it?

357
00:26:39,047 --> 00:26:41,440
Scott: and only smart people go in the hall of the Mountain King?

358
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:42,723
Scott: Everyone else goes.

359
00:26:42,743 --> 00:26:47,103
Scott: I have no idea but I know the song just like chromatic episode 2.

360
00:26:47,103 --> 00:26:53,359
Rym: You know the story of like the story behind the song in the hall of the Mountain King Like what story the song is trying to portray?

361
00:26:53,680 --> 00:27:02,013
Scott: there was a mountain and there was a. there's a hall in the mountain with the king in it and there was like a An elf or some shit going to meet him or something and died.

362
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:02,836
Scott: and I don't know what.

363
00:27:02,856 --> 00:27:03,800
Scott: I don't know.

364
00:27:03,861 --> 00:27:06,367
Scott: Just make it shit up That's not it at all.

365
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,400
Rym: I just wondered maybe I'll do a show on something like that.

366
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,928
Scott: You do a whole show on the hall of the Mountain King.

367
00:27:12,109 --> 00:27:13,172
Scott: Yeah, I'll spell.

368
00:27:13,212 --> 00:27:17,530
Scott: I'll talk about this old DOS game I played that was a had.

369
00:27:17,571 --> 00:27:25,999
Scott: that song was the only music and you were like this elf guy walking around with a net and you would capture things and then you would answer questions and then.

370
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:30,440
Rym: so It's not like that DOS or that ASCII dwarf game that our people in our forums are playing.

371
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,770
Scott: No, it's not like that at all.

372
00:27:31,811 --> 00:27:32,959
Scott: This is like a children's game.

373
00:27:34,702 --> 00:27:44,249
Rym: Anyway Anyway, the main bit today if you couldn't tell from the opener is we're going to because we couldn't come up with what we were Going to talk about today.

374
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:45,360
Scott: We thought we had no idea.

375
00:27:45,481 --> 00:27:51,966
Rym: We thought origins week was great And then last night we finished the episode and I turned to Scott and I said What are we gonna do tomorrow?

376
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:54,677
Rym: and he didn't say anything and I didn't say anything.

377
00:27:54,697 --> 00:27:56,905
Rym: and then we both Simultaneously said fuck.

378
00:27:57,166 --> 00:28:02,806
Scott: Yeah, it was like we're gonna do the origins of how we got into sports and I was gonna be like I was right.

379
00:28:02,907 --> 00:28:05,880
Scott: I'm a hereditary fan of New York sports teams.

380
00:28:06,121 --> 00:28:17,740
Scott: yeah, the end and I talked about like how I got into music as a musician, but Scott's not a musician or Unless I'm more of a musician than most people but less of a musician than musicians.

381
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:22,580
Rym: I mean there weren't many things that we could both talk about that any of you would care about.

382
00:28:22,861 --> 00:28:26,199
Scott: Yeah, and then that Rym was enlightened.

383
00:28:26,219 --> 00:28:33,098
Rym: I Thought of it only because you know, I'm not sure why I thought of it probably are crazy forums.

384
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:37,450
Scott: possibly This episode is basically fan service for the forum folk.

385
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:40,738
Scott: And if you like this episode, you'll probably like the forum.

386
00:28:40,758 --> 00:28:41,360
Scott: So go join.

387
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:46,000
Rym: Yeah, the forums are getting to the point where I can't deal with them on my own anymore.

388
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,687
Scott: Yeah, like it used to be like like it.

389
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:55,120
Rym: let me put it this way if Scott and I stopped doing GeekNights I'll bet the forums would keep going for a while a long while.

390
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:00,260
Scott: The thing is there's some forums I go to on the internet where I read only like a few stories, you know.

391
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,799
Scott: And there's some forums I go on the internet where no one's there.

392
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:07,111
Scott: Our forums are like on this borderline now where they're either growing.

393
00:29:07,131 --> 00:29:09,598
Scott: it used to be that I could read every story.

394
00:29:09,618 --> 00:29:15,460
Scott: now I can still read every post on our forums, but it's a lot and I'm getting tired.

395
00:29:15,621 --> 00:29:18,652
Scott: So eventually real soon probably in a few weeks.

396
00:29:18,753 --> 00:29:20,640
Scott: I won't be able to read the whole forums anymore.

397
00:29:21,002 --> 00:29:22,268
Scott: I'll have to let some of it go.

398
00:29:22,288 --> 00:29:24,258
Rym: Well, the thing is you all know, mr.

399
00:29:24,298 --> 00:29:28,332
Rym: Period There's a good chance that he will be joined by mr.

400
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:29,235
Rym: Question mark.

401
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:29,717
Rym: Mr.

402
00:29:29,777 --> 00:29:33,770
Rym: Comma, mr Semicolon in the future because we and mr.

403
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:36,580
Rym: Period are not enough to handle the forums anymore.

404
00:29:36,922 --> 00:29:39,640
Scott: No, it is getting out of control, but we digress.

405
00:29:40,441 --> 00:29:41,372
Rym: Therefore no God.

406
00:29:43,261 --> 00:29:47,615
Scott: Okay, there be no God anyway zero that the topic here.

407
00:29:47,815 --> 00:29:48,096
Rym: We're good.

408
00:29:48,116 --> 00:29:53,200
Scott: We're not gonna talk about Philosophy, yeah, we're not gonna argue for or against atheism.

409
00:29:53,421 --> 00:30:00,807
Scott: We're going to talk about how we became to have the beliefs that we do have and first to define that was a great sin That was beautiful.

410
00:30:00,848 --> 00:30:01,392
Scott: That's awesome.

411
00:30:01,513 --> 00:30:13,520
Rym: before we do anything I want to define the terms and I'll use the definitions the simplified definitions that we are going to use now because This is one of those topics where the exact nature of what you say means a lot.

412
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:22,794
Rym: I mean, there's a huge difference between saying there is a God there might be a God there Can't be a God or there probably isn't a God and there isn't.

413
00:30:22,814 --> 00:30:27,371
Scott: there's a huge Demarcation there and you could even get more specific.

414
00:30:27,391 --> 00:30:28,456
Scott: you'd be like there never was.

415
00:30:28,516 --> 00:30:31,394
Scott: there is now There isn't now there used to be.

416
00:30:31,475 --> 00:30:34,207
Rym: there will be If you really want to get into it.

417
00:30:34,227 --> 00:30:35,973
Scott: there might have been but there isn't now.

418
00:30:36,374 --> 00:30:55,410
Rym: if you guys really want to have this argument Someday, or you really want to learn a lot about this read up on agnosticism as in what agnosticism really means and then Gnosticism and what that really means and then solipsism and what that really means and it's all philosophy Which Scott says is BS and I say is the only truth.

419
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,333
Scott: Yeah.

420
00:30:56,453 --> 00:31:06,176
Scott: Oh and also I just want to note that Richard Dawkins has a new book I don't know if it's out yet or just recently out or coming soon called the God's illusion, which you should read.

421
00:31:06,196 --> 00:31:09,459
Rym: I Thought you're gonna mention a different book that he wrote a while ago.

422
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:13,275
Scott: No, the one that he's kind of like the newest hot one the God's illusion is his new one.

423
00:31:13,295 --> 00:31:18,420
Rym: Yeah, but anyway We're not talking about spirituality personal belief.

424
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:23,994
Rym: We're mostly talking about atheism and theology in regards to religion now.

425
00:31:24,014 --> 00:31:41,819
Rym: I posted in the forums the thing but to reiterate Spirituality or Gnosticism are much more in line with philosophy and thought exercises than with practical applications Because they tend to fall along the lines of there may be a god or I feel that there is a god or I feel That there is something out there, but I can't prove it.

426
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:49,464
Rym: Therefore it's not scientific and it's not something that can apply to the real world or it doesn't have to exist because I exist Whether or not I believe in it.

427
00:31:50,126 --> 00:31:51,350
Rym: Yeah, but religion is.

428
00:31:51,832 --> 00:31:55,064
Rym: when you take that and you put a specific belief behind it It's no longer.

429
00:31:55,466 --> 00:31:58,681
Rym: there might be a creator or there might be a demiurge It's now.

430
00:31:59,243 --> 00:32:07,543
Rym: there is a specific god named Bob and he lives in the sky and his son ate peas on Thursday And that's why dogs have tails Ever.

431
00:32:07,784 --> 00:32:12,320
Scott: people only exist because a flying spaghetti monster created us with this noodly appendage.

432
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:20,120
Rym: So just don't forget that while we talk about this that we're talking about religion not philosophy not spirituality.

433
00:32:20,402 --> 00:32:21,470
Rym: Those are different topics.

434
00:32:21,893 --> 00:32:24,785
Rym: So anyway You want to start or shall I?

435
00:32:24,946 --> 00:32:26,149
Scott: I'll start because I'm a Jew.

436
00:32:26,169 --> 00:32:29,920
Rym: Yeah, you were also much closer to anti theism than I am.

437
00:32:30,141 --> 00:32:38,880
Scott: Yeah slightly but Anyways, I was born a Jew from Queens now culture nice Jewish boy by blood and by culture.

438
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,474
Scott: Well, I was you know, yeah, but I mean I was born that way.

439
00:32:42,595 --> 00:32:46,673
Scott: but then you know I was a Jew, you know, and it kind of just like.

440
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,020
Scott: I didn't think about it that much.

441
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,071
Scott: I wasn't like, you know, it's an Orthodox Jew or you know, it's not.

442
00:32:51,151 --> 00:32:55,290
Scott: it was kind of like yeah, I'm Jewish I didn't think about God.

443
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:58,122
Scott: I didn't you know think about Religion.

444
00:32:58,162 --> 00:33:07,480
Scott: I thought about video games and cartoons and shit, you know when I was a little kid and I mean You know, he went to the synagogue and we did the Jew stuff, but I didn't think much of it.

445
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:15,277
Scott: It was just like a thing we do, you know, like, you know other kids did church and we did Jewish temple because that's the way it is.

446
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,809
Scott: you know these people do this those people do that.

447
00:33:17,849 --> 00:33:18,311
Scott: who cares?

448
00:33:18,713 --> 00:33:20,019
Scott: and I was a little kid I didn't care.

449
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:27,080
Scott: and Then you know, like I just lived my life as if I wasn't very religious.

450
00:33:27,341 --> 00:33:32,317
Scott: I didn't believe in anything magical, but I didn't you know say I am an atheist.

451
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:33,200
Scott: Ah ha ha ha ha.

452
00:33:33,481 --> 00:33:36,200
Scott: I just kind of didn't do or care.

453
00:33:36,601 --> 00:33:52,172
Scott: I even did a lot of stuff hanging out with Jews and going to Israel and doing Jew trips and Making Jew friends and going to Jew temples and celebrating Jew holidays, but I didn't really ever you know Believe strongly or at all.

454
00:33:52,193 --> 00:33:58,000
Rym: It was just kind of a Now what about things like Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny or Hanukkah Harry?

455
00:33:58,802 --> 00:34:01,854
Scott: Yeah, Hanukkah Harry was just a joke that I discovered in high school.

456
00:34:02,034 --> 00:34:03,299
Scott: It was always just kind of a joke.

457
00:34:04,066 --> 00:34:10,860
Scott: I just like saying Hanukkah Harry Yeah, Santa Claus the Easter Bunny tooth fairy all that stuff like when I was a little kid.

458
00:34:11,302 --> 00:34:15,380
Scott: I don't think there was ever a point at which I just said yes it where I believe that it was true.

459
00:34:16,025 --> 00:34:18,163
Scott: I was pretty much like Questioning it.

460
00:34:18,203 --> 00:34:20,431
Scott: I was like, I don't know.

461
00:34:21,174 --> 00:34:28,246
Scott: I don't know That's really that was one thing.

462
00:34:28,306 --> 00:34:30,351
Scott: is that the problem with Jewish white?

463
00:34:30,532 --> 00:34:33,100
Scott: I've noticed that lately there are a lot of Jewish atheists.

464
00:34:33,281 --> 00:34:39,800
Scott: They're like even like atheist rabbis like, you know, they're they're rabbis, but they don't believe that there's anything supernatural.

465
00:34:40,127 --> 00:34:40,679
Scott: It's crazy.

466
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,101
Scott: Well,

467
00:34:41,222 --> 00:34:56,686
Rym: I I just note that we I mean we go to conventions a lot and there are many times We'll meet like a webcomic artist or we meet someone cool we know and they're they're obviously Jewish and Scott will say something like hey Something something Jew and they'll be like, yep something something Jew.

468
00:34:56,706 --> 00:35:09,775
Rym: and then Scott will pause a minute and he'll say Atheist Jew and without fail they've always said right on or yes or something to that effect Yeah, it's it's what I think my current theory not even very high.

469
00:35:09,795 --> 00:35:11,240
Scott: not this is non theistic Jew.

470
00:35:11,441 --> 00:35:12,245
Rym: Yeah, put it that way.

471
00:35:12,325 --> 00:35:15,340
Scott: my current hypothesis about the atheist Jews is that?

472
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:34,300
Scott: Judaism is really a religion about studying this old and false book full of good stories and as a result modern Jews strongly emphasized to their children education like education the most important thing in the world like a Jewish mother cares more about the grades of their children, you know.

473
00:35:34,461 --> 00:35:38,280
Scott: I think the only thing they care more about the grades of their children is the health of their children.

474
00:35:38,541 --> 00:35:39,284
Scott: It's like are you eating?

475
00:35:39,324 --> 00:35:40,751
Scott: Well, did you get an a?

476
00:35:41,253 --> 00:35:42,900
Scott: it's like that's the heads that that's the list.

477
00:35:43,201 --> 00:35:45,227
Rym: You look a little thin you only got an a-minus.

478
00:35:45,347 --> 00:35:46,169
Scott: yeah, I know right.

479
00:35:46,631 --> 00:36:02,060
Scott: so as a result the kid Jewish kids You know, especially recent ones my generation and newer are very very educated and when you're very very educated You tend not to be as religious, you know, I mean sure there are very educated religious people.

480
00:36:02,642 --> 00:36:08,640
Scott: But as a whole, you know, if you look most non religious people tend to be more educated.

481
00:36:08,901 --> 00:36:11,132
Scott: Well, actually that's why it's only a hypothesis.

482
00:36:11,192 --> 00:36:13,866
Scott: I don't have a I don't have a causation I only have a correlation.

483
00:36:13,907 --> 00:36:16,080
Rym: I bring up a couple of interesting studies over the years.

484
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:30,215
Rym: Well, there have been many studies showing that the prison population is in America At least the most religious group of people in the country Mm-hmm if you're people in prison are more likely to be Christians than they are to be any.

485
00:36:30,235 --> 00:36:31,800
Scott: but is it because they're in prison?

486
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,786
Scott: And then they become religious or they?

487
00:36:33,866 --> 00:36:34,549
Rym: it's hard to say.

488
00:36:34,649 --> 00:36:38,000
Scott: Yeah, see there's another correlation without cozy, you know, but yeah.

489
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:43,339
Rym: But there are other correlations like the more the higher degrees a person has the less religious they tend to be.

490
00:36:43,622 --> 00:36:44,696
Scott: Yeah stuff like that.

491
00:36:44,838 --> 00:36:58,572
Scott: Yep I remember reading this great article about a guy who was a super Christian and then he had like he got many many PhDs in like theology and then he just had to become an atheist and he was kind of sad about having to you know Stop believing of

492
00:36:59,058 --> 00:36:59,180
Rym: course.

493
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:07,459
Rym: then there was the Emperor Julian of Byzantine who was sent to study Christianity and he studied it more and more and more and the More he studied it the more he thought it was wrong.

494
00:37:07,841 --> 00:37:09,908
Rym: But instead of saying I'm an atheist.

495
00:37:10,068 --> 00:37:13,118
Rym: He said I'm going back to worship the Roman gods.

496
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:13,720
Rym: I'm a pagan.

497
00:37:14,061 --> 00:37:16,147
Scott: Yeah, all right anyway, then he got killed.

498
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:20,960
Scott: The point is is that you know, I never really believed strongly in any of it.

499
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:29,759
Scott: I mean, I'm a huge fan and still a huge fan of like, you know Culture and heritage of Jews because I think everyone should be a fan of their own heritage.

500
00:37:29,799 --> 00:37:33,472
Rym: in college I never would have guessed from the Israeli flag that you hang in your bedroom.

501
00:37:33,572 --> 00:37:37,665
Scott: I only it's not there anymore actually, but Yeah, I bought it.

502
00:37:37,685 --> 00:37:39,131
Scott: but you know, I'd like flags.

503
00:37:39,292 --> 00:37:41,260
Scott: so when I went to Israel there was an Israeli flag.

504
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,349
Scott: So and it's a cool flag.

505
00:37:42,389 --> 00:37:43,700
Scott: So I bought it and I hung it up.

506
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,380
Scott: It was you know, some people thought it was like in college.

507
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,240
Scott: I remember some Israeli came up to me and he's like, hey you from Israel and I'm like, no, I just bought it there.

508
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,986
Scott: I think it's cool.

509
00:37:53,328 --> 00:38:00,828
Rym: Yeah, I wasn't trying to make a statement or anything Actually in my bedroom in high school for the longest time at a Russian flag, not the Soviet Russian flag But the modern Russian flag.

510
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:05,360
Scott: Yeah, because I was a fan of their hockey team It's not as cool as the one with the sickle and the hammer and the stars.

511
00:38:05,522 --> 00:38:10,620
Rym: Yeah, I know I know I couldn't find the communist one easily to purchase but I had a Russian flag.

512
00:38:10,701 --> 00:38:15,587
Scott: No, because you'd only find that in like a commie store Anyway, or on the internet.

513
00:38:15,868 --> 00:38:21,026
Scott: so not ever really having believed strongly, you know I just kind of didn't care.

514
00:38:21,226 --> 00:38:29,111
Scott: and then you know in recent years like I'd say within the past four to five years Mostly at college, you know religions started doing bad things.

515
00:38:29,151 --> 00:38:31,358
Scott: We started seeing terrorists blow shit up.

516
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:35,573
Rym: We started I think it's more that you noticed religion was doing bad thing.

517
00:38:35,633 --> 00:38:44,319
Scott: that also, you know And I noticed like I watch I was heavily influenced by like, you know, Randy Which I started reading the amazing Randy James Randy Randy org.

518
00:38:44,641 --> 00:38:50,524
Scott: Yeah, I started noticing all these, you know, like I used to just ignore that stuff, you know Like it was like.

519
00:38:50,544 --> 00:38:56,126
Scott: at one point I had the attitude of I'm not sure these herbal medicines are doing anything I don't believe in that.

520
00:38:56,266 --> 00:38:57,313
Scott: Yeah, I don't you know.

521
00:38:57,394 --> 00:38:59,229
Scott: and other people would be like no What are you talking about?

522
00:38:59,269 --> 00:39:00,964
Scott: And then I was like wait a minute They really don't.

523
00:39:01,004 --> 00:39:01,930
Scott: these people are crazy.

524
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,359
Scott: and I just started seeing.

525
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:09,880
Scott: You know faith and just belief in stuff without proof causing all sorts of harm everywhere.

526
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:12,372
Scott: So I'm like, alright now I'm now I'm pissed off.

527
00:39:12,413 --> 00:39:13,518
Scott: So I'm actually gonna care.

528
00:39:14,342 --> 00:39:16,493
Scott: It was like I was an atheist, but I wasn't really.

529
00:39:16,533 --> 00:39:19,144
Scott: I just didn't care at all I didn't even have an opinion.

530
00:39:19,204 --> 00:39:23,540
Scott: and then I started noticing that the non atheist was causing a problem.

531
00:39:23,641 --> 00:39:27,019
Scott: So I had to you know move slightly to the other side and go girl.

532
00:39:27,361 --> 00:39:30,439
Rym: So basically you were an atheist who became also a skeptic.

533
00:39:30,686 --> 00:39:31,722
Scott: Yeah Something like that.

534
00:39:32,284 --> 00:39:38,120
Rym: see my story is much more complicated partly because on my father's side the family is Catholic from Belgium.

535
00:39:38,782 --> 00:39:39,706
Scott: Mm-hmm, though.

536
00:39:39,807 --> 00:39:42,539
Rym: I don't think my father ever actually believed in it.

537
00:39:43,234 --> 00:39:43,721
Scott: Yeah I don't.

538
00:39:43,922 --> 00:39:54,560
Rym: it's kind of hard to gauge how much my family and I know my mom was both a hippie and a witch and A pagan and all sorts of fun stuff when she was younger and I don't think she ever quite gave up on all that.

539
00:39:54,922 --> 00:39:57,075
Rym: Yeah, but I mean I went.

540
00:39:57,236 --> 00:39:57,880
Rym: I lived in Detroit.

541
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:03,200
Rym: I was born in downtown Detroit, which basically meant being a frail nerdy white boy.

542
00:40:03,481 --> 00:40:06,209
Rym: There is no way I could go to public schools.

543
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:09,719
Rym: No offense to Detroit, but those schools would have killed me.

544
00:40:10,401 --> 00:40:23,367
Rym: so my parents spent a lot of money to send me to a Catholic school and as a result, I one had to attend religion classes and I had to go to church and we had to go to church every Sunday and I Never actually really believed it.

545
00:40:23,728 --> 00:40:32,900
Rym: I mean I kind of when I was very young, you know, like elementary school like first grade I kind of just you know, my parents would say, you know Hey, we gotta go to church and I'd go to school.

546
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:36,480
Rym: They'd be like, ah Jesus did this and I just didn't question it because no teachers know everything.

547
00:40:37,421 --> 00:40:43,559
Rym: And then I started noticing right around around second grade that a lot of it didn't make sense particularly this whole heaven business.

548
00:40:44,582 --> 00:40:50,440
Scott: Yeah, I remember like the weirdest thing was that when I was in school like public school learning history, right?

549
00:40:50,801 --> 00:40:59,600
Scott: And then we'll go to Hebrew school and learn history and I'd be like, alright, I try to match up the years I'd be like, alright, so what did Moses come before after this, you know?

550
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,606
Scott: I'd be like what the Egyptians are doing this.

551
00:41:02,088 --> 00:41:05,700
Scott: I could never match up the timelines and then eventually I figured it out.

552
00:41:05,983 --> 00:41:07,519
Scott: Oh those things didn't happen.

553
00:41:08,344 --> 00:41:09,733
Scott: Yeah, those are just made up.

554
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,846
Scott: Oh But that's why it doesn't matter.

555
00:41:12,886 --> 00:41:12,986
Scott: the

556
00:41:13,026 --> 00:41:28,738
Rym: things that really struck me was that one if there's this all-powerful God Why does he care if I waste two hours of my Sundays my free time to sit in a box and listen to someone talk about things I don't care about and then give me some bread a little bit of wine.

557
00:41:28,758 --> 00:41:38,116
Rym: and Then more importantly the idea of heaven was what bothered me the most because I thought about it and I realized that the concept Of heaven was frightening.

558
00:41:38,176 --> 00:41:51,360
Rym: to me It sounded like the most horrid boring terrible thing that could ever happen because according to at least Catholic mythos If you heaven is where you will go and sing the hosannas to the highest forever.

559
00:41:51,761 --> 00:41:57,159
Rym: basically, if you are good here, you'll see get sent to heaven where you can spend the rest of your life worshiping someone.

560
00:41:57,179 --> 00:42:04,159
Rym: and at that point I thought straight up and this is like second grade if that's what heaven is I'd rather go to hell.

561
00:42:04,179 --> 00:42:15,402
Rym: and Then I thought about hell and I realized wait a minute I'm only on earth for at most like a hundred and thirty years probably more like 60 or 70.

562
00:42:15,402 --> 00:42:18,197
Rym: So, uh, let's say I do bad things in this God's eyes.

563
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:27,025
Rym: All right If I do bad things, he's gonna send me to hell forever Forever because I did one bad thing even I did a million bad things.

564
00:42:27,065 --> 00:42:31,999
Rym: forever seems like a lot for a million bad things because it's infinitely bigger than a million.

565
00:42:32,019 --> 00:42:37,694
Rym: and then I thought but the whole idea is kind of stupid because if there's a God and he made me.

566
00:42:38,096 --> 00:42:40,230
Rym: why would he make me just so we can throw me in fire?

567
00:42:40,251 --> 00:42:45,159
Rym: and Then from there, I pretty much thought oh there probably just isn't a God.

568
00:42:45,179 --> 00:42:52,231
Rym: see I think that's one of the reasons that I just kind of just it didn't make sense Yeah, or I like the more I studied it the more I thought about it.

569
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,519
Rym: and this is like a second grader.

570
00:42:54,821 --> 00:43:03,540
Rym: So most of the answers I got were I'd ask a teacher Who was a nun and they would give me some bullshit answer and then I'd say that answer doesn't make sense and they'd hit me.

571
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:15,917
Scott: Or they'd say well don't question it I Don't really like in least in the conservative Jewish temples, you know and all that stuff that I went to.

572
00:43:15,957 --> 00:43:16,900
Scott: they don't really teach.

573
00:43:17,623 --> 00:43:18,991
Scott: You know like stuff like that.

574
00:43:19,192 --> 00:43:20,780
Scott: I mean what you learn in Hebrew school.

575
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:26,217
Scott: I mean other than people saying there is God he's ever, you know, they didn't even say he.

576
00:43:26,257 --> 00:43:28,022
Scott: they said there's a God It's everywhere.

577
00:43:28,042 --> 00:43:28,824
Scott: It's omnipotent.

578
00:43:28,865 --> 00:43:29,446
Scott: It's omniscient.

579
00:43:29,546 --> 00:43:35,143
Scott: Whatever the they don't really say, you know, like yeah, Adam and Eve is true Believe it.

580
00:43:35,203 --> 00:43:36,369
Scott: Yeah, all this stuff is true.

581
00:43:36,409 --> 00:43:36,751
Scott: Believe it.

582
00:43:36,791 --> 00:43:39,985
Scott: They say let's learn Hebrew Let's learn the Hebrew alphabet.

583
00:43:40,026 --> 00:43:41,492
Scott: Let's memorize these songs.

584
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:42,596
Scott: Let's sing and dance.

585
00:43:42,737 --> 00:43:43,460
Scott: Let's eat food.

586
00:43:43,729 --> 00:43:52,248
Scott: You know They don't really teach all this kind of stuff that I was able to question at least not at the age that I was still You know going and attending and all that stuff.

587
00:43:52,288 --> 00:43:54,898
Scott: So there really wasn't anything to make me go.

588
00:43:54,958 --> 00:43:58,432
Scott: Wait a minute You're you're full of shit because they didn't say anything.

589
00:43:58,613 --> 00:44:00,260
Scott: They just taught me the Hebrew language.

590
00:44:00,564 --> 00:44:01,599
Scott: They only taught me how to read it.

591
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,477
Scott: I don't understand most of the words but

592
00:44:03,739 --> 00:44:06,619
Rym: yeah Catholics were much different in that they would say like

593
00:44:07,001 --> 00:44:07,422
Scott: literally,

594
00:44:07,482 --> 00:44:15,459
Rym: this is what happens and this is this and Jesus did this and God did this and the Holy Spirit is this and They just it didn't make any sense at all.

595
00:44:15,721 --> 00:44:24,880
Scott: Yeah, the worst that we would get is yeah Moses parted the sea and I was like, oh You know, it was only like a little things here and there which I kind of ignored didn't really care.

596
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:25,343
Rym: Well, you know what?

597
00:44:25,363 --> 00:44:25,746
Rym: It's like.

598
00:44:25,968 --> 00:44:26,874
Rym: it's like what do you want him in?

599
00:44:26,894 --> 00:44:27,680
Scott: This is a pretty good movie.

600
00:44:28,482 --> 00:44:34,880
Rym: When you watch utenna and something fucked up happens and you just think it's anime stuff like that happens.

601
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,620
Scott: Yeah, that's exactly what you don't question.

602
00:44:36,761 --> 00:44:51,347
Scott: They tell me this story about you know, two people and you know One guy cheats on another guy and then guy does a bad thing and then you know And it's like other than like Noah's Ark which I guess, you know is kind of believable because I didn't imagine like some You know non possible flood.

603
00:44:51,407 --> 00:44:52,691
Scott: I imagined a normal flood.

604
00:44:52,792 --> 00:45:01,959
Scott: So, you know, it's kind of like You know, they tell these stories and I would imagine them in a way that you know made sense without you know.

605
00:45:02,019 --> 00:45:07,380
Rym: crazy I'd imagine them and I couldn't possibly conceive of a way for them to make sense in a rational world.

606
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:07,741
Rym: So like

607
00:45:07,922 --> 00:45:19,560
Scott: the Noah's in the ark like I imagine that there weren't that many people because it was so early in the history of The world that you know They were like all in one spot and then it all got flooded in one area where they were and then the flood went away.

608
00:45:20,082 --> 00:45:27,020
Scott: So I remember one day this is the second or third grade the two animals though I did I just kind of didn't think about that the two of every animal.

609
00:45:27,442 --> 00:45:30,156
Rym: I just remember there was a point at which I was sitting down.

610
00:45:30,176 --> 00:45:32,650
Rym: I was in church I didn't want to be there and it was hot and it sucked.

611
00:45:33,093 --> 00:45:34,038
Rym: and I just thought you know, what?

612
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:35,922
Rym: There's no God.

613
00:45:36,303 --> 00:45:42,120
Rym: and then I thought I got last chance if you're there do something awesome right now.

614
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,851
Rym: Otherwise, you don't exist and nothing happened.

615
00:45:45,871 --> 00:45:46,554
Rym: and I thought all right.

616
00:45:46,935 --> 00:45:52,239
Rym: and the next day I told my parents yeah, so I don't want to go to church anymore and my parents didn't seem to care at all.

617
00:45:52,259 --> 00:46:00,386
Rym: and They I think like I went to catechism when I moved out of public school or out of private school into public school For like a month.

618
00:46:00,406 --> 00:46:01,853
Rym: and then I was like, this is horseshit.

619
00:46:02,154 --> 00:46:03,340
Rym: I'm not going to this anymore.

620
00:46:03,882 --> 00:46:08,899
Scott: Yeah, my parents like I don't think my dad really cares and I'm pretty sure my grandpa doesn't see anything.

621
00:46:09,281 --> 00:46:11,780
Rym: I know at least my grandma was really religious.

622
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:17,280
Scott: Yeah, my grandma's not really religious, but I do think that she believes in some sort of you know, spiritual God.

623
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,520
Rym: Well, my grandma was always warning when I was a little kid to not get into all that occult stuff.

624
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:23,789
Rym: Cuz they'll steal my soul and sacrifice me to the devil.

625
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:29,019
Scott: Yeah, and all I thought my grandma says Why don't you find and marry a nice Jewish girl?

626
00:46:30,381 --> 00:46:32,129
Rym: You get married a nice Jewish girl.

627
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:33,334
Rym: I get the devil will get you.

628
00:46:33,575 --> 00:46:34,800
Rym: Yeah, don't do that occult stuff.

629
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,009
Rym: Of course, all I thought is the kid was.

630
00:46:36,049 --> 00:46:37,420
Rym: but that occult stuff sounds awesome.

631
00:46:37,646 --> 00:46:46,404
Rym: Yeah Because I gotta say I really like a lot of the cultural aspects of not so much the modern religions But the older religions like.

632
00:46:46,445 --> 00:46:50,760
Rym: there are things in them that I really like and I like cultures in general.

633
00:46:51,403 --> 00:46:53,194
Rym: So, I mean I do a lot of silly things.

634
00:46:53,395 --> 00:46:59,280
Rym: like whenever I drink wine I always leave a little bit of my glass with glass which nominally is for the fairies, which I know.

635
00:46:59,681 --> 00:47:02,751
Rym: Yeah, they're not out there, but I still I thought I'd like to think like it's cool.

636
00:47:02,771 --> 00:47:05,059
Rym: It's kind of a cultural thing an affectation.

637
00:47:05,624 --> 00:47:10,666
Scott: It's because you're a fairy And I'm very philosophical.

638
00:47:10,947 --> 00:47:14,900
Rym: I still I think a lot, you know, I I have existential crises pretty much every day.

639
00:47:15,281 --> 00:47:16,887
Rym: But I think a lot about philosophy.

640
00:47:16,928 --> 00:47:18,775
Rym: and what am I and where did I come from?

641
00:47:18,815 --> 00:47:21,566
Rym: But the thing is No religion.

642
00:47:21,968 --> 00:47:29,897
Rym: There's never been evidence in all of history For the existence of any of the supernatural things that any known religion has ever claimed.

643
00:47:30,017 --> 00:47:38,840
Rym: never yet Every religion known to man you can find historical origins of it and those historical origins have always been secular.

644
00:47:39,221 --> 00:47:43,880
Rym: You can see the political and the cultural and the social forces that brought about these religions.

645
00:47:44,482 --> 00:47:49,800
Scott: Yeah, like it the the Old Testament is like the easiest one cuz like okay is this book?

646
00:47:50,381 --> 00:47:51,686
Scott: Let's see where it came from.

647
00:47:51,746 --> 00:47:53,131
Scott: Let's see where each part came from.

648
00:47:53,271 --> 00:47:58,619
Scott: Oh, well, look, here's a part that's called in a Apocryphal text that didn't make it that used to be in the book.

649
00:47:59,181 --> 00:48:05,140
Scott: Oh, here's a part Deuteronomy that was written by these guys the Deuteronomist in year X. They were just some guys.

650
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,287
Rym: Well, here's here's a really really useful anecdote.

651
00:48:07,307 --> 00:48:12,859
Rym: because this was I got in trouble for laughing out loud in class And I wouldn't tell my teacher why in high school.

652
00:48:13,602 --> 00:48:24,268
Rym: But we were sitting in a social studies class and we were talking about India and and like reverence for cows panacheads and things like And things like that, you know where that comes from?

653
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:27,260
Scott: now someone where I got that from right someone.

654
00:48:29,562 --> 00:48:30,465
Rym: I'm just letting that go.

655
00:48:30,706 --> 00:48:31,227
Scott: Why don't you?

656
00:48:31,328 --> 00:48:33,394
Scott: why don't you share with the class?

657
00:48:33,434 --> 00:48:35,200
Scott: Why why I said who panacheads?

658
00:48:36,242 --> 00:48:41,489
Rym: So, oh, come on you suck We'll have to forums to meter that one out.

659
00:48:41,609 --> 00:48:42,091
Scott: All right, we'll see.

660
00:48:42,131 --> 00:48:43,376
Scott: if they guess why I can't.

661
00:48:43,436 --> 00:48:44,380
Scott: I came to mind suddenly.

662
00:48:44,942 --> 00:48:47,389
Rym: So we are talking about and he's talking about.

663
00:48:47,409 --> 00:48:58,123
Rym: the cows were sacred but that came about because Invading forces realized that I forget the exact details that the cows were more useful in a famine Situation.

664
00:48:58,183 --> 00:49:03,539
Rym: for their milk and the pen they're dung and then they were for their meat and if you killed them It was a waste of a resource.

665
00:49:04,082 --> 00:49:05,728
Rym: So they're sacred now there.

666
00:49:05,788 --> 00:49:10,999
Scott: that way people won't kill them and people will be better off a lot of yeah A lot of stuff in the in the Old Testament's like that too.

667
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,786
Scott: Like, you know don't eat pig.

668
00:49:12,947 --> 00:49:16,459
Scott: was because in those days gnosis if you ate a pig you got your kenosis.

669
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:19,812
Scott: Sure to eat a pig.

670
00:49:19,993 --> 00:49:32,497
Rym: I don't remember the details But I remember that we had this discussion and then this girl raised her hand in class and she said and I remember it very clearly Well, so you're saying that their religious thing just came from what some guy said to trick them.

671
00:49:32,738 --> 00:49:34,644
Rym: and the teacher says yeah We have a lot of evidence this.

672
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:37,435
Rym: and she says well, why do they still believe it?

673
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:38,338
Rym: Didn't anyone tell him?

674
00:49:39,604 --> 00:49:42,747
Rym: And I Remember that she was a Christian and I was.

675
00:49:42,847 --> 00:49:45,695
Rym: I just I started laughing cuz I didn't.

676
00:49:45,796 --> 00:49:51,455
Rym: I just wanted to stand up and say Christians are just Joe's but they were just uprisings in Judea.

677
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:52,660
Rym: They came from this cult.

678
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,348
Rym: We know exactly where it came from.

679
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:55,434
Rym: It's no different.

680
00:49:55,675 --> 00:49:56,379
Rym: What the hell?

681
00:49:58,363 --> 00:49:58,804
Rym: It was the most.

682
00:49:58,844 --> 00:50:06,173
Rym: it was so ironic your religion came from some guy just saying stuff - aha Or it might have come from some guy writing stuff.

683
00:50:06,676 --> 00:50:09,626
Scott: Oh Huh doesn't matter either way.

684
00:50:09,746 --> 00:50:12,035
Scott: Yeah, I could have come from some girl right and stuff.

685
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:18,100
Rym: Yeah, but in terms all this I mean, I never believed in Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny or any of that at all.

686
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,609
Rym: I pretty much knew from the start.

687
00:50:19,629 --> 00:50:30,844
Rym: It was my parents at least from the moment I was sentient yeah, and I played along because I knew that my parents were trying to do this thing and I kind of gathered what it was like The idea of it.

688
00:50:31,246 --> 00:50:33,236
Rym: and also I had a little brother and I wasn't gonna ruin it for him.

689
00:50:33,256 --> 00:50:36,020
Rym: So I Pretended to go along with it.

690
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:42,900
Rym: But I knew and I always used to set little like traps because I knew it would catch my parents.

691
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:46,160
Rym: So like I'd string tripwires the night before Christmas in the living room.

692
00:50:46,644 --> 00:50:48,439
Rym: Yeah, just cuz I knew a trip my dad up.

693
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:54,020
Scott: The only thing really a bit magical about Hanukkah is where the hell did she hide those presents in the basement?

694
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:54,803
Scott: I couldn't find them.

695
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,029
Scott: I looked down there the day before.

696
00:50:56,089 --> 00:50:56,832
Scott: where were they see?

697
00:50:56,973 --> 00:50:58,460
Rym: I knew where my parents had the presents.

698
00:50:58,581 --> 00:50:59,886
Rym: I didn't look at him out of respect.

699
00:50:59,987 --> 00:51:02,960
Rym: I don't because I didn't want to ruin that moment of finding out what they were.

700
00:51:03,422 --> 00:51:03,824
Scott: I never.

701
00:51:04,165 --> 00:51:05,551
Scott: I knew they were hidden in the basement.

702
00:51:05,591 --> 00:51:08,706
Scott: because you know eight days of presents and every night We're standing in the kitchen.

703
00:51:08,846 --> 00:51:10,334
Scott: Mom goes down to the basement.

704
00:51:10,394 --> 00:51:11,480
Scott: We watch her go down there.

705
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,690
Scott: She comes back up with presents.

706
00:51:12,771 --> 00:51:13,295
Rym: you go down there.

707
00:51:13,315 --> 00:51:13,880
Rym: You couldn't find him.

708
00:51:14,181 --> 00:51:17,900
Scott: I would go down there like, you know the day before Hanukkah look at that couldn't find shit.

709
00:51:18,021 --> 00:51:18,966
Scott: I'd go down there during.

710
00:51:18,986 --> 00:51:19,570
Scott: I couldn't find shit.

711
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:21,139
Scott: I don't know where the hell she hid those things.

712
00:51:21,462 --> 00:51:22,250
Scott: I still don't know.

713
00:51:22,392 --> 00:51:26,080
Rym: Maybe I should ask her Yeah, I I knew where my parents hit all of them.

714
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:26,884
Rym: I just didn't look at him.

715
00:51:27,024 --> 00:51:30,640
Scott: they hid it in the basement some tricky place and it's you know, it was of course.

716
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:37,160
Rym: I remember my parents taking me to see Santa Claus and I remember every time just thinking why are they putting me through this?

717
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,971
Rym: It's obviously some fat old guy making minimum wage.

718
00:51:39,991 --> 00:51:42,260
Scott: Yeah, I always knew it was a fat old guy making minimum wage.

719
00:51:42,401 --> 00:51:43,490
Scott: There was no question about that.

720
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:53,600
Rym: Yeah scary Yeah, but also a nice little aside here in terms of the word atheism a lot of people confuse it.

721
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,679
Rym: Atheism is not anti theism.

722
00:51:56,462 --> 00:51:57,204
Rym: They're similar.

723
00:51:57,444 --> 00:52:13,617
Rym: but anti theism is the belief that there is nothing supernatural or at least that there are no religious things or no No gods or however you want to define theism atheism is Effectively the belief that there aren't anything because there's no evidence or it's.

724
00:52:13,878 --> 00:52:17,398
Rym: there's the similar Agnosticism that you believe you can't know and therefore you don't care.

725
00:52:18,304 --> 00:52:18,727
Scott: Yeah to me.

726
00:52:18,787 --> 00:52:20,620
Scott: I really I don't care what you believe.

727
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:26,065
Scott: I mean if you believe in the Flying Spaghetti Monster for real or if you believe in the Christian guy It doesn't matter.

728
00:52:26,166 --> 00:52:27,620
Scott: What matters is how you live your life.

729
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:59,456
Scott: You know if you live your life as if there is an all-powerful All-seeing God who will punish you and you do and the actions you take are based on Your fear of some imaginary thing then you're living your life in a very different way from someone who makes decisions based on things that happen in the real world and real consequences and One kind of person is very dangerous and one kind of potentially very dangerous and the other kind is Quite likely much less dangerous and in fact beneficial to the world as a whole.

730
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:04,480
Scott: and you know That's what really matters to me is it's like are you a crazy nut who's gonna you know?

731
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:13,439
Scott: Go blow up an abortion center because you believe some crazy batshit or you someone who's gonna go You know research some science because you know that there ain't other shit out there.

732
00:53:15,002 --> 00:53:20,145
Rym: You know that was almost eloquent until you said the words there ain't other shit out there There ain't other shit out there.

733
00:53:20,185 --> 00:53:21,792
Rym: That was that was horrid.

734
00:53:21,812 --> 00:53:23,780
Rym: Yeah, I don't know what to say to that.

735
00:53:23,881 --> 00:53:24,874
Rym: That was just horrid.

736
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:27,766
Rym: Yeah And I'm just.

737
00:53:27,867 --> 00:53:29,720
Rym: I mean, I'm very much more philosophical.

738
00:53:29,841 --> 00:53:34,200
Rym: I mean, I think I think a lot about what where's my consciousness come from and where is it going?

739
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:34,581
Rym: And where?

740
00:53:34,701 --> 00:53:36,167
Rym: what did anything make it?

741
00:53:36,227 --> 00:53:37,051
Rym: Was it always there?

742
00:53:37,111 --> 00:53:37,793
Rym: Was it formed?

743
00:53:37,834 --> 00:53:38,637
Rym: Is it just physical?

744
00:53:38,697 --> 00:53:39,480
Rym: is some quantum thing?

745
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,317
Rym: I don't know about.

746
00:53:41,263 --> 00:53:42,440
Rym: And you know all those sorts of things.

747
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:47,818
Scott: I'd like the answers to those questions, but really even if I had all of them, they really wouldn't affect.

748
00:53:48,079 --> 00:54:01,133
Rym: you know I guess you know what I think I that's that's one of the big parts of not a Idea that if if there is a creator or if there isn't a creator It doesn't matter because what you're observing happens the same.

749
00:54:01,474 --> 00:54:07,400
Rym: and the theory you have about what you're observing Doesn't require the creator because you found another alternate solution.

750
00:54:07,821 --> 00:54:09,969
Rym: Therefore it doesn't matter if the creator exists or not.

751
00:54:09,989 --> 00:54:11,334
Rym: So you don't have to worry about it.

752
00:54:11,876 --> 00:54:12,097
Scott: Yeah.

753
00:54:12,277 --> 00:54:14,205
Scott: Yeah You know, I'm not.

754
00:54:14,245 --> 00:54:15,249
Rym: I mean, I'm not a Gnostic.

755
00:54:15,289 --> 00:54:17,860
Scott: I'm just saying that's why I'm not a hundred percent with that.

756
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:19,246
Scott: But I can't.

757
00:54:19,367 --> 00:54:22,120
Rym: I am a philosophical solipsist and basically nothing.

758
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,716
Scott: It's mostly that I care about the physical world that I'm.

759
00:54:24,917 --> 00:54:25,320
Scott: I know.

760
00:54:25,521 --> 00:54:25,621
Scott: I'm.

761
00:54:26,143 --> 00:54:34,979
Scott: I can know that the the physical real world that we are living in and podcasting in Is true a lot more than I can know that some made-up idea of a god is true.

762
00:54:35,301 --> 00:54:39,817
Scott: So I'm gonna go with that and atheism really fits with that and the other things don't see.

763
00:54:39,837 --> 00:54:42,929
Rym: but I'm also a very Speculative theologist like I always wonder they like.

764
00:54:42,949 --> 00:54:45,700
Rym: I'll just sit around and think like what if this was true?

765
00:54:45,941 --> 00:54:47,366
Rym: What if this thing was happening out there?

766
00:54:47,406 --> 00:54:48,892
Rym: What if there were gods but they were like this?

767
00:54:48,972 --> 00:54:49,333
Rym: or what if?

768
00:54:49,996 --> 00:54:51,160
Rym: what if I'm God?

769
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,507
Rym: Or what if Scott Scott or what?

770
00:54:52,648 --> 00:54:53,171
Rym: What's going on?

771
00:54:53,292 --> 00:54:53,855
Scott: I am God.

772
00:54:53,935 --> 00:54:54,719
Scott: I didn't let you know.

773
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:57,050
Rym: Oh shit, see the sad truth is that I'm God.

774
00:54:57,090 --> 00:54:59,160
Rym: I made you think you're God so you wouldn't bother me shits.

775
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:06,680
Scott: Or I thought I made you think you were God you could think well, you know what I put the poison in both cups.

776
00:55:06,824 --> 00:55:20,666
Rym: Oh crap yeah, but I think about those things a lot and I don't I mean I said this a lot in this episode but I got To say it again because people always seem when we have these arguments in the forums to Selectively read what we post like.

777
00:55:20,727 --> 00:55:23,594
Rym: I'll say something like religion is like.

778
00:55:23,734 --> 00:55:26,824
Rym: it's not true and someone will be like blah blah blah Blah blah blah blah.

779
00:55:26,844 --> 00:55:27,307
Rym: There's a chance.

780
00:55:27,327 --> 00:55:27,770
Rym: There's a chance.

781
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:29,200
Rym: There's a chance philosophy philosophy.

782
00:55:29,802 --> 00:55:33,074
Rym: And I have to say something like I didn't say no philosophy.

783
00:55:33,114 --> 00:55:33,677
Rym: No philosophy.

784
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:34,620
Rym: There's no chance of a god.

785
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:38,540
Rym: I said what you just said is not true and here's evidence for that.

786
00:55:38,861 --> 00:55:44,860
Scott: Yeah, people really gotta pay attention to specific wordings of things when it comes to philosophical debates.

787
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:49,940
Rym: Yeah, believing something might exist is far different from being convinced something specific exists.

788
00:55:50,321 --> 00:56:02,140
Scott: Yeah, I mean if someone says to me, you know, yeah, there might be God I'll go like yeah There's a you know I'll give my argument about the chance of there being one so infinitesimally small that it's stupid to bet on it.

789
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:04,228
Scott: But it isn't false that there could be.

790
00:56:04,248 --> 00:56:10,579
Scott: there could be some God some all-powerful force Who's making everything the way it is right now and is invisible to us?

791
00:56:10,765 --> 00:56:21,879
Rym: Yeah I'm much more like and I think is much more feasible the idea that there are probably beings that are I don't want to say higher or lower because that's all relative but more powerful than us.

792
00:56:22,381 --> 00:56:24,970
Rym: But we're not interacting with them in any way we know.

793
00:56:25,031 --> 00:56:28,924
Rym: so even if we are interacting with beings like that somehow We don't know it.

794
00:56:29,204 --> 00:56:30,067
Scott: We can't know it.

795
00:56:30,287 --> 00:56:34,038
Rym: We can't show it therefore effectively whether or not they exist or not.

796
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:38,399
Rym: It doesn't matter Yeah, but the I still like to think about whether or not they exist.

797
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:47,174
Scott: Yeah, my point is is that if someone comes up to me and says, you know There is this there is a guy named Jesus and he did this and this and this.

798
00:56:47,215 --> 00:56:48,920
Scott: that is such a specific thing.

799
00:56:49,421 --> 00:56:52,209
Scott: It's not just like yeah, there might be something it's.

800
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:56,380
Scott: this specific thing is true with no evidence for it whatsoever.

801
00:56:56,662 --> 00:56:58,335
Scott: It's like no you're an idiot.

802
00:56:58,355 --> 00:57:02,378
Scott: Shut up You know, it's like goddamn what what how could you uh?

803
00:57:03,441 --> 00:57:07,119
Scott: That's what I'm against is when someone has a you know, this is the way it is.

804
00:57:07,582 --> 00:57:11,819
Scott: I got no way to prove it, but that's the way it is And if you say otherwise, you're wrong and you go to hell.

805
00:57:12,441 --> 00:57:14,588
Rym: Well, we could talk about this forever.

806
00:57:14,648 --> 00:57:18,420
Rym: And I know this was kind of fragmented partly because we're actually really fucking tired.

807
00:57:18,941 --> 00:57:20,505
Scott: I'm so goddamn tired one.

808
00:57:20,546 --> 00:57:24,657
Rym: This topic was a cop-out because we couldn't think of anything else tonight - we're really.

809
00:57:24,677 --> 00:57:25,760
Scott: it's also fan service.

810
00:57:26,121 --> 00:57:30,575
Rym: Yeah, it's fan service because if you've been in our forums you see that we we have discussions like.

811
00:57:30,595 --> 00:57:33,403
Scott: it's a popular topic of debate But it's not.

812
00:57:33,484 --> 00:57:34,868
Rym: there's not a lot of debate.

813
00:57:34,948 --> 00:57:38,940
Rym: There's mostly a lot of philosophical pondering and then a lot of jokes.

814
00:57:39,781 --> 00:57:40,708
Scott: That's the best way.

815
00:57:40,769 --> 00:57:41,535
Scott: That's the way it should be.

816
00:57:41,757 --> 00:57:45,720
Rym: but a Final closing bits here not about this topic, but about GeekNights in general.

00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:40,587

842
00:58:59,889 --> 00:59:01,840
Rym: in case you want to see what we're gonna talk about ahead of time.

843
00:59:02,201 --> 00:59:15,544
Scott: I think the last thing I got to say is that next week our favorite sport ice hockey begins the 2006-2007 NHL.

844
00:59:15,564 --> 00:59:18,558
Scott: I think it starts on like Tuesday or Wednesday the first NHL games.

845
00:59:18,919 --> 00:59:20,339
Rym: now We often do themed weeks.

846
00:59:20,662 --> 00:59:23,860
Rym: But we're not going to do a hockey themed week because we know a lot of you don't care about hockey.

847
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,399
Scott: Yeah, and there's not much to say about hockey.

848
00:59:25,439 --> 00:59:26,003
Scott: me What are we gonna?

849
00:59:26,023 --> 00:59:29,320
Scott: we're gonna turn this into like the sports show where we give the results of the games.

850
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:30,728
Scott: I mean you could listen to ESPN for that.

851
00:59:30,768 --> 00:59:34,306
Scott: Yeah, plus I mean and they're better than we are You're not big hockey role.

852
00:59:34,347 --> 00:59:35,713
Rym: Not we're not big sports fans.

853
00:59:35,753 --> 00:59:37,340
Rym: We're a much bigger video game fans.

854
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:40,940
Scott: Yeah, we're not gonna all of a sudden Thursday and a sports day or anything.

855
00:59:41,121 --> 00:59:42,686
Rym: But what we are going to do?

856
00:59:42,927 --> 00:59:53,800
Rym: because things of the day along these lines have been popular in the past and several people have Suggested this we are going to do hockey fight week or things of the because everyone knows the best part of hockey is the fighting.

857
00:59:53,961 --> 01:00:02,170
Scott: So all next week all next week all eight things of the day are going to be hockey fights nothing But hockey fights nothing but hockey fights.

858
01:00:02,873 --> 01:00:08,820
Scott: In fact, I one of them is in fact They're going to be the top eight hockey fights that we can find on YouTube and Google video.

859
01:00:09,041 --> 01:00:11,510
