1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,100
Scott: It's Tuesday, June 27th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,980
Scott: Tonight, we give a session report on our weekend of board gaming.

3
00:00:18,362 --> 00:00:19,053
Scott: Let's do this!

4
00:00:20,942 --> 00:00:22,180
Rym: It's Monkey Tuesday!

5
00:00:22,581 --> 00:00:23,010
Rym: Doo doo doo doo doo.

6
00:00:23,985 --> 00:00:24,515
Scott: Doo doo doo doo doo.

7
00:00:25,661 --> 00:00:39,839
Rym: Alright, Juan, if any of you don't listen to Penn Jillette's podcast, or radio show, whatever, on free FM, free FM, lightning lightning, here you can be free, whatever, yeah, well one, check it out.

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,339
Rym: Two, check it out on Tuesdays if you do nothing else.

9
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,959
Scott: They should have a separate Tuesday only feed for that show.

10
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,420
Rym: Monkey Tuesday!

11
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,288
Rym: Doo doo doo doo doo.

12
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,740
Rym: Well anyway, he has Monkey Tuesday, which is, it's just monkeys.

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,899
Rym: They'll talk about monkeys every Tuesday.

14
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:07,800
Scott: Listeners will all call in or mail in stories about monkeys that are humorous, usually involving smoking monkeys, monkey hiring a prostitute, that sort of thing.

15
00:01:08,021 --> 00:01:11,660
Scott: All kinds of craziness, and it's high-larious.

16
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:21,620
Rym: Now for the 4th of July, because he went on about how Monkey Tuesday falls on the 4th of July this year, he is looking for patriotic monkey stories.

17
00:01:22,304 --> 00:01:22,698
Scott: Holy crap.

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:36,799
Rym: Now Scott and I, this was Scott's idea, and I think it's a wonderful idea, we are going to try to make up the most hilarious and awesome, patriotically themed monkey story in the world, record it, send it to Penn, and see if he'll play it on the air.

19
00:01:37,561 --> 00:01:43,799
Scott: Yup, or read it on the air if it's an email, or maybe he'll call us when he's on the air because we won't be in the car or anything.

20
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,260
Rym: Yeah, no, I'll be at work or something.

21
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,317
Scott: Yeah, something like that.

22
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:47,733
Scott: Yeah.

23
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,917
Scott: No, but, yeah, he actually said, you know, if you don't have any stories, make them up and send them in.

24
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:56,479
Scott: He won't check to see if it's the real deal.

25
00:01:57,243 --> 00:01:58,620
Rym: Our story's gonna have freaking monkeys.

26
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:06,660
Scott: I was thinking it'd be an open air circus, monkeys, fireworks, yeah you get the idea.

27
00:02:07,581 --> 00:02:10,960
Rym: We're talking about monkeys liberating their fellow monkey friends with fireworks.

28
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,840
Scott: On the 4th of July, at a circus.

29
00:02:14,006 --> 00:02:14,420
Rym: Alright.

30
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,479
Scott: Monkey Tuesday.

31
00:02:19,443 --> 00:02:31,660
Rym: Anyway, in the actual non-monkey related news, the Supreme Court in 1989 ruled that flag burning is constitutionally protected free speech.

32
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,819
Scott: Yup, I mean, it's just a cloth with a design on it.

33
00:02:36,161 --> 00:02:39,540
Rym: Yeah, and burning it, I mean, as long as you don't burn someone else's flag.

34
00:02:40,121 --> 00:02:45,679
Scott: Or as long as you don't set anything else on fire, or harm anyone with the fire, you're allowed to make fires.

35
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:48,840
Rym: Well, a lot of places you aren't, but that's a whole different-

36
00:02:48,880 --> 00:03:04,542
Scott: As long as you don't, if you make a fire somewhere, you're not allowed to make a fire because it's dangerous, you know, but you can start a fire in your backyard, or on a campground, or in the street, as long as it's, you know, not like a fire, like a campfire in the middle Or what,

37
00:03:04,582 --> 00:03:07,580
Rym: I could burn a tiny little flag, and then it's no more dangerous than a cigarette.

38
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,276
Scott: There you go.

39
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,298
Scott: You're allowed to do that.

40
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:22,500
Rym: Well, for anyone who isn't aware of this, very periodically, the Congress of the United States will rally around, particularly around election times, and try to pass a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning.

41
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:28,360
Rym: This has been coming up every single election year in some form for a long time.

42
00:03:29,294 --> 00:03:29,640
Scott: Mm-hmm.

43
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:40,499
Rym: The difference is that just today, the Senate voted on whether or not they should put forth the measure that would actually put the flag burning amendment to a ratification bid.

44
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,060
Scott: Now, if you don't know, flag burning is still okay, which means this still, this has never passed.

45
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,580
Scott: They tried a zillion times, and it's never passed.

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,796
Rym: This time, the vote was 66 in favor of the amendment, 34 against.

47
00:03:54,301 --> 00:04:01,958
Scott: So only one, you're one guy away, one senator away from possibly not being allowed to burn flags.

48
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:10,160
Rym: Now, even scarier than this, it turns out that about 56% of Americans fully support this amendment and want flag burning to be banned.

49
00:04:10,921 --> 00:04:14,485
Scott: If anyone comes up to me and says they want flag burning to be banned, I'll say, "You hate

50
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:14,772
Scott: freedom.".

51
00:04:16,242 --> 00:04:24,480
Rym: Now, the interesting thing is that there were three Republicans who voted against this, and one of them was the Republican whip, Mitch McConnell.

52
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,380
Rym: Mitch, one-gallon-challenge McConnell.

53
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:29,620
Scott: That's an inside joke about another guy named Mitch.

54
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,060
Rym: Yeah, we know this guy Mitch, who is not a senator.

55
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,680
Scott: No, but he did do the one-gallon challenge.

56
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,339
Rym: Well, he attempted the one-gallon challenge.

57
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,499
Scott: Yes, anyway, that's why it's a challenge.

58
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,540
Rym: I wonder if Mitch McConnell's ever attempted the one-gallon challenge.

59
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:44,837
Rym: Might have to get him on the show and ask him.

60
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:45,395
Scott: Yep.

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,498
Rym: God, if we got Mitch McConnell on the show.

62
00:04:47,841 --> 00:04:48,417
Scott: That'd be crazy.

63
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:50,340
Rym: We'd just ask him that one question.

64
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:58,331
Scott: Well, we'd also be like, "Hey, so, uh, congratulations for having some nuts, unlike your other friends there in the

65
00:04:58,391 --> 00:04:58,594
Scott: Senate.".

66
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:11,740
Rym: Yeah, but I mean, he's the whip of the Republicans, and he voted against this, but other than that, it was pretty much a straight party-line vote, and the fact that it was only one vote away from going to a ratification bit kind of scares me.

67
00:05:12,141 --> 00:05:15,400
Scott: It's kind of frightening, and it's kind of weird that, you know, what is it?

68
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,600
Scott: Democrats voting for freedom?

69
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,300
Scott: That's kind of frightening.

70
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:31,020
Scott: Well, I mean, the Republicans- They're usually, like, if you look at what should be the official Democratic party line, the Republicans are actually supposed to be more freedom than the Democrats.

71
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:31,462
Rym: Yeah, well, isn't?

72
00:05:31,482 --> 00:05:46,980
Rym: it used to be that the conservatives and the Republicans will cut taxes and save money and be frugal, and the Democrats are tax-and-spend liberals, but it's gotten now to where the Democrats are the fiscally conservative ones, and the Republicans are tax-and-spend.

73
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,999
Rym: Well, no, no, no, they're tax-cut-and-spend.

74
00:05:50,241 --> 00:05:51,578
Scott: The other guys are tax-and-spend.

75
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,939
Scott: Spending is across- we need a no-spend party to get voted in.

76
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,800
Rym: The problem is, we can't cut spending on most things without creating holy hellfire.

77
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:08,281
Scott: Oh, you're just gonna have to deal with some holy hellfire now, or, in the future, you won't-.

78
00:06:08,422 --> 00:06:12,440
Scott: you know, if we have a little bit of holy hellfire now, we can survive later.

79
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:12,876
Scott: Oh, yeah.

80
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,610
Scott: If we don't have holy hellfire now, later we're doomed and there's no way we can fix it.

81
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:25,400
Scott: It's either suffer now to fix it forever, or for a long time, or we're gonna get to a point where it can't be fixed and it's all over.

82
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:32,040
Rym: I guess it just frightens me that the government in general has been more and more attacking the First Amendment from every possible front.

83
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,900
Rym: I mean, the FCC's powers have been expanded recently.

84
00:06:35,402 --> 00:06:40,760
Rym: They've greatly increased the fines for, you know, speaking obscenities on the radio, fuck.

85
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:41,698
Scott: Fuck.

86
00:06:42,388 --> 00:06:42,759
Scott: Fuck them.

87
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:52,420
Rym: And, now, this bill almost passed that would further- I mean, it would pass an amendment to restrict the First Amendment.

88
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:10,200
Scott: You know, it's really so dumb, it's like, I can't tell if the people who are voting for this amendment, maybe some of them really are for flag burning and for freedom, and they just know that if the amendment passes, that there will be a glut of extra flag burning.

89
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,320
Scott: 'Cause right now, there isn't a problem with flag burning.

90
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,100
Rym: I gotta say, if that amendment passed, I would be out on the street burning flags.

91
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,699
Scott: You know what, I would start a company to sell flags made out of extremely flammable materials.

92
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,920
Rym: No, you gotta make 'em out of a special wick so they burn for a long time.

93
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:29,739
Scott: Well, they would be, but they would be easy to light on fire, they would burn safely- To sell flags.

94
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:32,940
Scott: They would burn safely, slowly, and brightly.

95
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,619
Scott: Special burning flags.

96
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,419
Rym: Just make flags that have wicks on 'em.

97
00:07:36,842 --> 00:07:36,931
Scott: Yeah.

98
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:42,960
Scott: Well, no, they'd also be all, like, waxed up, and they'd have some pyro in them to get, like, red, white, and blue fire.

99
00:07:43,762 --> 00:07:44,739
Scott: It'd be so great.

100
00:07:45,942 --> 00:07:48,520
Rym: I think that would be patriotic, having a red, white, and blue fireball.

101
00:07:49,185 --> 00:07:49,269
Scott: Yeah.

102
00:07:50,943 --> 00:07:51,217
Rym: Yeah.

103
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:51,629
Scott: Yeah.

104
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:58,259
Rym: Now, I could talk more about this, but it's just a news bit, and not a- What if a firework I buy has a little tiny flag on it?

105
00:07:58,664 --> 00:07:59,880
Scott: Like, on the cardboard?

106
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:01,458
Rym: You know what?

107
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,500
Rym: It depends on the specific wording of the amendment, and the laws that would thereby be passed.

108
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:15,800
Rym: Though I'll note, I'll note that if this were passed, there has only been, in the history of this country, one other amendment ever that restricted freedom.

109
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,140
Scott: Every amendment- Prohibition.

110
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:21,858
Rym: Every amendment we've ever had has either increased freedom, or had nothing to do with freedom.

111
00:08:22,247 --> 00:08:22,439
Scott: Yup.

112
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:28,280
Rym: And the only amendment that ever restricted freedom was the Prohibition.

113
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,440
Scott: And when Prohibition said, "You can't drink alcohol," and you know what?

114
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,400
Scott: There was more alcohol drinking during Prohibition than ever.

115
00:08:35,003 --> 00:08:36,360
Rym: And the fact that it was repealed.

116
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:36,751
Scott: Yeah.

117
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:46,738
Scott: So, if there was a flag burning amendment, I bet you there would be more flag burning than has ever happened in the history of the world within a week, and then they would have to repeal it.

118
00:08:47,082 --> 00:08:49,720
Scott: Or, they would be putting so many people in jail.

119
00:08:51,682 --> 00:08:55,460
Scott: Yeah, we really, we should start a company now that makes special burning flags.

120
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:56,840
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

121
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,019
Rym: Though, if something like that ever actually passed, I don't know what I'd do, other than burn flags.

122
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:02,859
Scott: I'd burn a lot of flags.

123
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,159
Rym: Yeah, but what else?

124
00:09:05,141 --> 00:09:08,660
Rym: What deeper inner meaning could we impart into that flag burning?

125
00:09:09,521 --> 00:09:11,639
Scott: I would burn lots and lots of flags.

126
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,396
Scott: Big ones.

127
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,360
Scott: All right, so I'd burn- In crazy places, in crazy creative ways.

128
00:09:16,561 --> 00:09:17,534
Scott: I'd burn a thousand flags.

129
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:25,399
Scott: I would make little paper airplanes out of flags and throw them through fire hoops and all kinds of crazy stuff.

130
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,059
Rym: So what would you call this act of yours?

131
00:09:29,427 --> 00:09:29,980
Scott: The aristocrats.

132
00:09:31,843 --> 00:09:33,759
Rym: See, without any prompting, I'm just glad you said that.

133
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,055
Rym: Yep.

134
00:09:34,445 --> 00:09:34,535
Rym: Okay.

135
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,000
Rym: Anyway, I have nothing else to say about this unless I did a whole episode on it.

136
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:45,779
Rym: I'm not going to get into a political rant, but goddamn, one vote, just now, Senate, first amendment, bye bye.

137
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,879
Scott: Thank you, One Gallon Challenge Mitch.

138
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,840
Rym: Yes, you're my man, Mitch One Gallon McConnell.

139
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,660
Scott: Yes, you saved me a lot of money on flags and matches.

140
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:02,480
Scott: Okay, meanwhile, the Supreme Court and the other one third of our government- Yeah, I don't think we need to talk about the administrative branch.

141
00:10:02,721 --> 00:10:03,119
Scott: No, we don't.

142
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,540
Scott: You mean the executive branch.

143
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,038
Rym: Yeah, well, they're also administrative to a degree.

144
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:18,217
Scott: So they are going to do some judgment, as judges do, on this case of KSR International Incorporated versus Teleflex.

145
00:10:18,881 --> 00:10:19,279
Rym: Oh, really?

146
00:10:19,645 --> 00:10:19,798
Rym: Yes.

147
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:20,612
Scott: Really?

148
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:30,050
Scott: Teleflex, apparently, has a patent covering, quote, "gas pedal," quote, "technology for cars and light

149
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:30,414
Scott: trucks.".

150
00:10:31,402 --> 00:10:34,999
Rym: Um, uh, what could this possibly be?

151
00:10:36,883 --> 00:10:38,900
Scott: I think they've really just patented the gas pedal.

152
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:56,479
Rym: You know, I gotta say, it doesn't surprise me, because I mentioned this before, but when I worked at IBM, I did, you know, crap for them all the time, and after I left, they emailed me, and they needed my information, my contact info, because they were trying to patent one of the things I had done for them.

153
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:05,180
Rym: Something that was trivial and just like part of my normal duties, like, I wouldn't even consider signing my name on what I had done.

154
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,379
Rym: It was like a bash script.

155
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,248
Rym: Mm-hmm.

156
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,700
Rym: But no, they want a patent on it, and it'll probably pass.

157
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:22,860
Scott: Yeah, okay, so, KSR, the good company, has argued that the Federal Circuit, which is all the federal courts, have been improperly interpreting patent law for years when it comes to deciding whether an invention is obvious.

158
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:24,760
Scott: I agree.

159
00:11:25,404 --> 00:11:25,700
Scott: Do you agree?

160
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,120
Rym: Yeah, but I wonder what the Supreme Court's gonna rule.

161
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:43,920
Scott: Well, the court has ruled in the past, for instance, that even a combination of preexisting, off-the-shelf components, in which each component performs exactly the same function that it had been known and was designed to perform, could be patentable.

162
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,100
Scott: Such an interpretation, KSR argued--I'm reading the article.

163
00:11:48,722 --> 00:11:49,600
Rym: Oh, obviously.

164
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:58,040
Scott: Such an interpretation, KSR argued, isn't consistent with the provision of federal patent law that dates to 1952, which I actually kind of like.

165
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,010
Scott: It says, "A person having ordinary--".

166
00:12:02,311 --> 00:12:09,838
Scott: uh, okay, "An invention is not eligible for a patent if a person having an ordinary skill in the art would consider it

167
00:12:10,058 --> 00:12:10,400
Scott: obvious.".

168
00:12:11,007 --> 00:12:11,819
Scott: I think that's pretty good.

169
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:17,400
Rym: Yeah, the problem is that people in the patent office aren't skilled in any art that would be patented.

170
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:23,940
Scott: Exactly, but all they have to do is call up one guy who is a person having ordinary skill in the art and ask him if that's obvious or not.

171
00:12:24,102 --> 00:12:25,053
Rym: They could call me.

172
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:26,939
Scott: They could call me.

173
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,278
Scott: I mean, the thing is-- If it's a car thing, call Joe the Mechanic, you know?

174
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,320
Rym: Yeah, though what do you do if it's an art where everyone is very intelligent?

175
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:42,120
Scott: If you call Joe the Mechanic and say, "Hey, Joe the Mechanic, uh, look at this design for a gas pedal.

176
00:12:42,482 --> 00:12:43,411
Scott: Is that--is that

177
00:12:43,532 --> 00:12:43,875
Scott: obvious?".

178
00:12:44,522 --> 00:12:45,420
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty obvious.

179
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,119
Scott: Okay, no patent.

180
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,380
Scott: Takes five seconds.

181
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,680
Scott: Five seconds to call Joe the Mechanic.

182
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:56,679
Rym: Yeah, but first they gotta vet out Joe the Mechanic's credentials, make sure he's a real mechanic, get the opinions of five other mechanics, then do the whole thing again?

183
00:12:56,699 --> 00:12:57,780
Rym: because No, you don't!

184
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,440
Scott: If you could just walk to a mechanic shop and show him the thing, that's all you need!

185
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,539
Rym: You realize the government can't do anything unless they can fully document the process from start to finish.

186
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:10,671
Scott: I went to Joe the Mechanic on Fourth and Main--.

187
00:13:10,712 --> 00:13:14,880
Rym: No, no, as in, what is the specific procedure for finding a specific mechanic for each patent?

188
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:19,480
Scott: This is the problem we have, is there's too much just useless paperwork in the way.

189
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,240
Rym: That's not even paperwork, it's just you gotta have some sort of procedure.

190
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:28,460
Scott: Yeah, the procedure is, you call someone who is having ordinary skill in the art.

191
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,079
Rym: Who do you call?

192
00:13:29,801 --> 00:13:31,260
Scott: Anyone in the Yellow Pages.

193
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,020
Rym: Um, what do you mean "anyone in the Yellow Pages"?

194
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,700
Rym: There's a lot of non-mechanics in the Yellow Pages.

195
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,400
Scott: Anyone who has ordinary skill in the art.

196
00:13:38,921 --> 00:13:40,880
Rym: How do you determine who has ordinary skill in the art?

197
00:13:41,101 --> 00:13:44,080
Scott: If it's a mechanic, you look under the mechanics section in the Yellow Pages.

198
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:49,338
Rym: What if it's a mechanic who happens to specialize in jaguars, and he doesn't know anything about any of their cars?

199
00:13:50,181 --> 00:13:52,877
Scott: Then you call-- if he knows about any car, he knows about gas pedals.

200
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,000
Scott: What if he just lies?

201
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,424
Rym: What if you call a mechanic and just some punk kid who works there answers, he says, "Yeah, I'm Joe,".

202
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,076
Rym: and then he just says, "Yeah, that's obvious,

203
00:14:00,117 --> 00:14:00,439
Rym: whatever.".

204
00:14:02,013 --> 00:14:02,160
Scott: Alright.

205
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:03,399
Rym: Fun.

206
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,180
Rym: No it's not.

207
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:04,759
Rym: Yes it is.

208
00:14:04,962 --> 00:14:05,720
Rym: It doesn't matter!

209
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:08,960
Scott: I'm not even Joe the Mechanic, and the gas pedal is obvious.

210
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:10,220
Scott: It's obvious.

211
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:10,951
Scott: Yeah.

212
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,700
Scott: Oh my god, who the hell is working in the patent office?

213
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:14,358
Scott: Retards?

214
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,279
Scott: What the fuck?

215
00:14:15,642 --> 00:14:16,440
Scott: It's a gas pedal.

216
00:14:17,047 --> 00:14:17,520
Scott: It's obvious.

217
00:14:17,961 --> 00:14:18,880
Scott: Every car has one.

218
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:19,856
Scott: You can't patent it.

219
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,019
Scott: Oh my god.

220
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,400
Rym: Scott, have you ever read a patent?

221
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,439
Scott: It's not-- I've seen a few.

222
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:39,659
Rym: It's not obvious when something is obvious, because if you actually read a patent, the way patents have to be written, and many of them are written this way specifically to prevent the USPTO from investigating them, patents are written in a way that is almost indecipherable to normal humans.

223
00:14:40,261 --> 00:14:43,720
Scott: I say if a patent is indecipherable to normal humans, it's immediately void.

224
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,360
Rym: No, because they won't accept patents that aren't written that way.

225
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:46,958
Scott: They shouldn't.

226
00:14:47,182 --> 00:14:48,900
Scott: There should be a new way of submitting patents.

227
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,390
Rym: What do you mean?

228
00:14:49,411 --> 00:14:49,699
Rym: a new way?

229
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,214
Scott: You write one paragraph that describes in plain English what your invention is, the end.

230
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:53,959
Rym: That doesn't work at all.

231
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,740
Rym: We're going to dive one picture.

232
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,780
Rym: Because what a patent is is you have to describe in excruciating detail what something does.

233
00:14:59,060 --> 00:14:59,418
Scott: You know what?

234
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:06,719
Scott: If your thing is only different from other things in a very small, very, very tiny way, then it's not different enough, fuck you.

235
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:12,720
Rym: I submit that with many very intricate manufacturing processes, in fact, it is very different.

236
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,535
Scott: You shouldn't be able to patent stuff like that.

237
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:15,658
Rym: Why not?

238
00:15:16,524 --> 00:15:19,819
Scott: I think you should only be able to patent physical inventions, that's it.

239
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,458
Rym: They are physical inventions.

240
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,320
Scott: What kind of physical invention is it, a machine?

241
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:31,019
Rym: A physical invention of a type of machine that can create a certain kind of glass-ceramic hybrid chip.

242
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,000
Scott: Good, here are the plans for my machine, there it is, the end.

243
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,180
Rym: Okay, what if I make a machine that's better, or does something in a new, innovative way?

244
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:44,020
Scott: The patent office gets the plans for the new machine, compares them to existing machine plans.

245
00:15:44,141 --> 00:15:45,840
Rym: They have no idea how this stuff works.

246
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:51,996
Scott: You look at the plans for the machine, you look at all the other plans for machines, you say, "Oh, it's not the same as all these other machines,".

247
00:15:52,016 --> 00:15:52,379
Scott: there you go.

248
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,439
Rym: What if they are the same, and they're just written differently?

249
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:01,640
Rym: What if they are substantially similar, or in fact, derivative, and you just didn't notice because you didn't vet the whole thing out fully?

250
00:16:02,321 --> 00:16:06,180
Rym: It's not an easy problem to solve, and I think you're really taking a naive viewpoint.

251
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,859
Scott: When it's a gas pedal, it is.

252
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:08,865
Scott: Yeah.

253
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,780
Scott: You shouldn't have to do all the bullshit for the gas pedal patent.

254
00:16:12,122 --> 00:16:15,619
Rym: See, I'm very much of the mind that the government should have to do all of the bullshit for everything.

255
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:16,425
Scott: No.

256
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,150
Scott: Yes.

257
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,320
Scott: Less bullshit is better.

258
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,320
Scott: No, because-- More common sense is needed.

259
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,260
Rym: Common sense is never going to enter into it.

260
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,800
Rym: There's no common sense in anywhere.

261
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,659
Scott: So-- There is common sense right here.

262
00:16:26,542 --> 00:16:28,000
Rym: Yeah, that doesn't work on a mass scale.

263
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,399
Rym: I'd like to see you try to run the country.

264
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:31,679
Scott: I could run the patent office real easy.

265
00:16:32,168 --> 00:16:32,298
Rym: Nah.

266
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,039
Scott: In fact, I could do every patent, put them all on my desk.

267
00:16:35,821 --> 00:16:39,499
Scott: Um, do you know-- I'll take every single one, I'll have a yes stamp and a no stamp, and you know what?

268
00:16:39,781 --> 00:16:42,500
Scott: That no stamp's gonna wear out real quick, so get me like 20 of 'em.

269
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,280
Rym: Do you know how many patents are submitted to the patent office?

270
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,499
Scott: Thousands upon thousands.

271
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,900
Rym: So what, you're just not gonna read 'em?

272
00:16:48,484 --> 00:16:48,917
Scott: I'll read 'em.

273
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,260
Scott: If they each get 10 seconds.

274
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:51,820
Rym: That's terrible.

275
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,820
Rym: I hope you're not serious.

276
00:16:53,081 --> 00:16:53,579
Scott: I'm serious.

277
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,219
Scott: That's a terrible-- If your invention is an obvious, so pain--.

278
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:03,420
Scott: See, here's the problem, is that we-- we're trying to weed out the patents that are obviously not patentable.

279
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,040
Scott: I say, your invention has to be so obviously new and amazing.

280
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:17,540
Rym: If it's not incredibly new and amazing, fuck it, if it's only slightly new and amazing, A lot of things wouldn't be in any way amazing to you, because they increase the yields of a factory by 0.8%.

281
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,699
Scott: That's not patentable, fuck you.

282
00:17:19,281 --> 00:17:19,699
Rym: Why not?

283
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,980
Rym: It's just as complex, in fact, more complex, and more valuable.

284
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,079
Scott: Has nothing to do with complexity or value.

285
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:26,039
Rym: Then what's it have to do with?

286
00:17:26,521 --> 00:17:29,040
Scott: Has to do with usefulness on a whole to people.

287
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,567
Rym: That's a huge usefulness.

288
00:17:30,587 --> 00:17:32,940
Rym: to be able to increase the efficiency of a factory by that much?

289
00:17:33,981 --> 00:17:34,276
Scott: Whatever.

290
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,075
Rym: I just really don't think you thought this through.

291
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:41,218
Scott: People like that, you shouldn't be patenting it, it should be given away to everyone, so everyone can do it.

292
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,040
Rym: Oh, so you just-- why even have patents then, because you seem to want to not have them.

293
00:17:44,661 --> 00:17:46,079
Scott: You have patents for certain things.

294
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,400
Rym: But you just said if anything's actually valuable, you have to give it away to the people.

295
00:17:49,822 --> 00:17:50,459
Scott: That useful?

296
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:52,520
Scott: I don't think it is that useful.

297
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,618
Rym: So what's the line then?

298
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,659
Scott: The line is what Scott says.

299
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,040
Rym: That's a terrible idea, because you don't know anything about most patents.

300
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,405
Scott: That's why you haven't--.

301
00:18:00,545 --> 00:18:07,933
Scott: I could do all the computer patents, definitely, and you'd have someone else just like me, who just knows something about mechanics, who knows something about factories.

302
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,700
Rym: Scott, how do we decide which person?

303
00:18:10,902 --> 00:18:11,779
Scott: It's someone who knows.

304
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:13,800
Scott: It's obvious when someone who knows.

305
00:18:13,901 --> 00:18:14,920
Rym: Who decides that?

306
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,760
Scott: The same way it's obvious when a gas pedal patent is obvious.

307
00:18:17,901 --> 00:18:19,159
Rym: Who decides that?

308
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:23,740
Scott: You don't need someone to decide, you say, look, here's a mechanic, he knows how to fix cars.

309
00:18:24,122 --> 00:18:24,639
Rym: Who says that?

310
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,460
Rym: Who picks the mechanic?

311
00:18:25,821 --> 00:18:26,118
Scott: Anyone.

312
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:26,811
Scott: What do you mean?

313
00:18:26,913 --> 00:18:27,180
Scott: anyone?

314
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,400
Scott: Anyone can do it.

315
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,400
Scott: Any Joe on the street could pick out a mechanic.

316
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,740
Rym: So you're saying Congress should pass a law where they pick a guy off the street and then he goes and picks a mechanic.

317
00:18:35,363 --> 00:18:35,758
Scott: That works.

318
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,858
Rym: That's the stupidest thing.

319
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:46,279
Scott: I guarantee it, 99 million times out of 100 million times, most of the time you're going to get someone who's going to pick someone just fine.

320
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,699
Rym: One, I highly doubt that.

321
00:18:48,101 --> 00:18:50,099
Rym: Two, that would never work in the real world.

322
00:18:50,403 --> 00:18:50,999
Scott: Yes, it would.

323
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:51,267
Scott: No.

324
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,239
Scott: It would work just fine.

325
00:18:52,560 --> 00:19:00,480
Scott: All right, we'll go on the street and we'll ask someone who's not a crazy old person from the crazy old folks' home and we'll say, all right, can you find a mechanic?

326
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,580
Scott: Where's the closest mechanic?

327
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,600
Scott: And the point at the gas station, we'll go there and we'll say, is there a mechanic here?

328
00:19:04,661 --> 00:19:05,258
Scott: And there will be.

329
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,360
Scott: And he'll be just a fine mechanic and he'll be able to pick out all the obvious mechanic patents.

330
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,337
Rym: One, are you going to pay him?

331
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,040
Scott: If you make that his new job, then yeah.

332
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,740
Rym: That's still, you'll need more than just him to look at all these patents.

333
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,740
Rym: Two, what if he makes a mistake?

334
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,596
Rym: Who is he accountable to?

335
00:19:21,322 --> 00:19:23,200
Rym: Is there any sort of peer review here at all?

336
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,980
Rym: Who gives you the authority to pick the guy off the street?

337
00:19:28,443 --> 00:19:29,420
Scott: It's just obvious.

338
00:19:29,741 --> 00:19:30,860
Scott: Everything is obvious here.

339
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,059
Scott: It's all about obviousness.

340
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,079
Rym: That doesn't work on a large scale at all.

341
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,280
Scott: We don't need all this bullshit.

342
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,200
Scott: We need to get rid of the bullshit and it's obvious to everyone.

343
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,439
Scott: No, it's not.

344
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,019
Scott: Who is it not obvious to?

345
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,500
Scott: Those are the people in the patent office.

346
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,938
Scott: That's who it's not obvious to.

347
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,479
Rym: I really think you haven't thought this through at all.

348
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:49,527
Scott: I think it's just fine and

349
00:19:49,547 --> 00:19:50,149
Scott: that anyone

350
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:50,692
Scott: who doesn't

351
00:19:50,752 --> 00:19:52,077
Scott: have enough common sense

352
00:19:52,398 --> 00:20:05,200
Scott: to be able to say, yes, that person knows what they're talking about and that person doesn't, shouldn't be involved in the patent process anyway and the rest of us can go about it in a completely normal, cheap, and efficient fashion.

353
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,420
Rym: An individual person may be able to say that, but that's their belief.

354
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,880
Rym: That doesn't in any way reflect the beliefs of the masses in a democracy.

355
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,280
Rym: You have to have some sort of process to put this all in place.

356
00:20:17,121 --> 00:20:25,280
Scott: So it doesn't make, so you're saying we have a process, then no matter what process it is, if we have one, then that will uphold the beliefs of the democracy?

357
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,940
Rym: How would you implement your idea?

358
00:20:27,923 --> 00:20:30,320
Rym: You haven't given any actual useful details.

359
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,499
Scott: Pick a random person.

360
00:20:32,581 --> 00:20:33,319
Scott: It doesn't matter who.

361
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:33,899
Scott: How do you pick?

362
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:34,187
Scott: Me.

363
00:20:34,682 --> 00:20:35,138
Scott: I do it.

364
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,239
Scott: It doesn't matter.

365
00:20:36,582 --> 00:20:36,818
Rym: Scott, no.

366
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,718
Scott: The president does it.

367
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,479
Scott: The secretary of something does it.

368
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,398
Scott: It doesn't matter who.

369
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:49,820
Scott: Anyone who's not retarded, anyone who doesn't work for the patent office because they're obviously retarded, and anyone who isn't evil and corrupt and paid for by any weird company.

370
00:20:50,141 --> 00:20:51,219
Rym: How do you determine that?

371
00:20:52,124 --> 00:20:52,680
Scott: Any way you want.

372
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,340
Scott: You can elect them.

373
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:53,669
Scott: What do you mean?

374
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:54,040
Scott: any way you want?

375
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,159
Scott: The president can appoint them.

376
00:20:55,281 --> 00:20:56,000
Scott: It doesn't matter.

377
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,355
Rym: No, pick a way because you haven't.

378
00:20:57,842 --> 00:20:58,500
Scott: It doesn't matter.

379
00:20:58,641 --> 00:21:00,059
Scott: Any of those ways is equally good.

380
00:21:00,241 --> 00:21:00,918
Scott: No, they're not at all.

381
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,040
Scott: They're all equally good.

382
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,739
Rym: That's just pathetic.

383
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:03,248
Scott: No.

384
00:21:04,784 --> 00:21:06,039
Scott: If we elect someone, it's fine.

385
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,160
Scott: If the president appoints someone, that's fine.

386
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,940
Scott: If Congress picks someone, that's fine.

387
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,500
Rym: Because there's a whole procedure in place and there's a lot of peer review and debate and there's a very specific way to do all of those things that is well documented and well understood.

388
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,408
Scott: And it's not working.

389
00:21:18,448 --> 00:21:19,700
Scott: so we should throw it the fuck out.

390
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,800
Rym: It works fine for the vast majority of people.

391
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,459
Scott: No it doesn't.

392
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,300
Scott: It works horribly.

393
00:21:24,323 --> 00:21:25,158
Scott: You'll look through the patents.

394
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,260
Scott: 99% of patents are just useless.

395
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,700
Rym: Oh, you're talking about patents specifically.

396
00:21:29,062 --> 00:21:32,957
Rym: Even then, it works fine for the vast majority of people because the vast majority of people don't care.

397
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,279
Scott: Which means they shouldn't care about it.

398
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,218
Scott: They got nothing to do with it.

399
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,538
Scott: We're the only ones who have to deal with this.

400
00:21:39,121 --> 00:21:40,399
Scott: So we should be the ones deciding it.

401
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:44,760
Scott: If you don't care and you don't care about something, you have no say in it.

402
00:21:45,141 --> 00:21:46,720
Scott: Only the people who care should have a say.

403
00:21:47,424 --> 00:21:48,338
Rym: One, that's not the way it is.

404
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,318
Scott: That's how it should be.

405
00:21:49,681 --> 00:21:50,859
Rym: How are you going to make it be that way?

406
00:21:51,381 --> 00:21:52,359
Scott: That's the way it should be.

407
00:21:52,781 --> 00:21:55,000
Rym: I really think arguing ideals like that is silly.

408
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,560
Rym: You gotta have some sort of actual plan or there's really no use in it.

409
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,338
Scott: Here's my plan, we go set all the patents on fire and we start from scratch and Scott's in charge.

410
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,140
Rym: Yeah, that's a terrible idea.

411
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,080
Scott: I become the new patent general guy and I'm in charge of everything.

412
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,760
Rym: Anyway, no one wants to hear you yell about your crazy plans.

413
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,759
Rym: Let's talk about games.

414
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,800
Scott: Things of the day.

415
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:21,920
Scott: Alright.

416
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:27,297
Scott: I got this, for anyone who doesn't know, there's another game that's not DDR.

417
00:22:27,477 --> 00:22:29,779
Scott: that's a lot like DDR called Pump It Up.

418
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,638
Rym: Which honestly I'm not really a fan of.

419
00:22:32,621 --> 00:22:46,180
Scott: You know, the thing about Pump It Up is the songs aren't as good, the game as a whole isn't as good of a game, but because of the arrows set up, if you get into it, there is greater capability of awesome dancing.

420
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:55,360
Scott: But you know, there's this capability for awesome dancing in DDR too, just Pump It Up has a little bit more because it has four diagonal arrows and a big circle in the middle.

421
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:59,418
Scott: So there's, you know, more things you can do, especially with a two pad set up.

422
00:23:00,801 --> 00:23:08,639
Scott: So here's this video on YouTube of a guy doing a song, I think the song's called Don't Bother Me because that's the name of the YouTube video.

423
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:15,980
Scott: And he does, basically if you took the pad away and you just saw him dance, you wouldn't know that he was doing a dancing game.

424
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,139
Scott: It's so awesome.

425
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,820
Scott: Not to mention that, but not only is he dancing, he's dancing amazingly.

426
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,939
Scott: Like I want to learn how to dance like that.

427
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,678
Scott: Holy crap.

428
00:23:26,287 --> 00:23:27,400
Rym: I mean, it's a good dance.

429
00:23:27,902 --> 00:23:29,840
Rym: I've seen a lot of other people do similar things before.

430
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,432
Rym: It's not really...

431
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:32,879
Scott: I have, but I think this is the best one I've seen.

432
00:23:33,723 --> 00:23:35,820
Rym: It only stood out because it was a Pump It Up video, honestly.

433
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,415
Scott: I don't know, I think it's just...

434
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:42,139
Rym: That and the fact that the crowd was giving him crap before he started dancing, and then they shut up.

435
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:42,514
Scott: Yeah.

436
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:54,058
Scott: Well, I mean, I've seen other videos of like DJ 8-Ball doing DDR, and he's really good, but you know, compared to the videos of him that I've seen, you know, there might be videos I haven't seen.

437
00:23:54,922 --> 00:23:57,499
Scott: And this video, I'd have to say this video is number one right now.

438
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,380
Rym: Yeah, you know what though, compared to actual dancers, he's got nothing.

439
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,440
Scott: Well, because actual dancers, just dancing period, of course.

440
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,599
Scott: They are the best.

441
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,034
Scott: Yeah.

442
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,900
Scott: Because you don't have to be confined to some arrows at all.

443
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,540
Scott: They're just dancing without arrows.

444
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,269
Scott: But apparently, the Pump It Up World Championship last year had $8,000 for first place, and this year is $30,000 for first place.

445
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,579
Scott: This guy entered last year and didn't win.

446
00:24:20,421 --> 00:24:27,479
Scott: So I wanna see the guy who did win last year, and who does win this year, because if it's better than this, holy crap.

447
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:34,640
Rym: I remember when we found, we didn't have DDR in Rochester, but there was this crap, crap arcade place that had a Pump It Up machine.

448
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,230
Scott: Yup, that place, yeah.

449
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:49,720
Rym: It was a broken Pump It Up machine, it was a terrible arcade, it wasn't really an arcade, it was kind of a family center, and it eventually got shut down because a bunch of kids came from the inner city for an event, and they trashed the place, and the police came.

450
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,148
Scott: Yup.

451
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,353
Rym: And after that, the police were like, "You can't have this place anymore, it causes

452
00:24:53,373 --> 00:24:53,635
Rym: trouble.".

453
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:02,900
Scott: Why does everything, you know, see our rant about old people taking away the fun things for kids to do, and then kids becoming drug dealers.

454
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,460
Rym: Yeah, yet in this case, the kids pulled knives on each other, and there was a big fight.

455
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:11,676
Scott: Yeah, see, because the kids didn't have anything fun, so they didn't know how to handle a fun thing.

456
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:17,880
Scott: It's like, if a kid's never had a playground, and then all of a sudden you gave them one, you know, they'd go on it and hurt themselves.

457
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,319
Scott: Like, you know, if they had a playground all along, then it wouldn't have happened.

458
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:28,757
Rym: Anyway, so, there's this guy here, on my thing of the day, who had never played Mario 1, ever.

459
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:29,399
Rym: Ever?

460
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:30,079
Rym: Ever.

461
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,520
Scott: How could you, okay, how old was he?

462
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,740
Rym: No, no, second, he was Japanese.

463
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:36,660
Scott: Whoa, whoa, so had he seen Mario?

464
00:25:36,982 --> 00:25:37,559
Rym: I don't think so.

465
00:25:38,107 --> 00:25:38,880
Rym: It was hard to follow.

466
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:46,328
Rym: It was, basically, they're on this talk show, and he's, you know, "This guy's never played Mario, blah, blah, blah, let's watch him play,".

467
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:54,934
Rym: and they show his face in the upper left-hand corner of the screen, and then the rest of the screen is him playing Mario, and he doesn't know what to do.

468
00:25:55,941 --> 00:26:07,895
Rym: He barely gets by the first Goomba, and he doesn't hit any blocks, and he's like cautious and cautious, and he almost falls off of things, takes a while to jump over a pipe, and then he dies on a Goomba, and he's like, "Oh, son of a

469
00:26:07,915 --> 00:26:08,196
Rym: bitch!".

470
00:26:09,541 --> 00:26:12,199
Rym: The best part is the second time through, he dies on the first Goomba.

471
00:26:13,262 --> 00:26:15,100
Scott: Dying on the first Goomba is always hilarious.

472
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,298
Rym: Then they're yelling at him, "Hit the blocks, hit the question mark blocks,".

473
00:26:18,318 --> 00:26:31,080
Rym: and he hits one, and this mushroom comes out, and it comes around, and it's coming down at him, and you can see him panic, and he's running away from it because he's afraid he's going to get him, and he barely jumps over it, runs away, and meanwhile the crowd's just exploding with laughter.

474
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:37,199
Scott: See, so I guess it is rare for someone in Japan, you know, everyone there knew how to play Mario.

475
00:26:37,361 --> 00:26:37,958
Rym: Except this guy.

476
00:26:39,283 --> 00:26:48,642
Scott: As a related note, actually, I just remembered that the three last polls on GameFAQs, which are always interesting, in fact, that's probably the best part of GameFAQs.com, is the polls, the three

477
00:26:48,702 --> 00:26:49,687
Scott: last polls were,

478
00:26:49,988 --> 00:26:51,536
Scott: "Have you ever played the original Mario

479
00:26:51,556 --> 00:26:51,918
Scott: Bros.,

480
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:56,100
Scott: have you ever played the original Final Fantasy, and have you ever played the original Legend of

481
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:56,490
Scott: Zelda?".

482
00:26:56,841 --> 00:26:57,798
Scott: You know what the results are?

483
00:26:59,241 --> 00:27:00,932
Scott: Have you ever played the original Super Mario

484
00:27:00,973 --> 00:27:01,134
Scott: Bros.?

485
00:27:01,134 --> 00:27:02,942
Scott: ? 47.67%

486
00:27:02,942 --> 00:27:19,559
Scott: say yes, and I still own the original cartridge, 42.58% say yes way back on the NES, about 13% say yes on an emulated version, and about, let's see, six, seven and a half percent say no.

487
00:27:20,261 --> 00:27:21,715
Scott: They've never played Mario.

488
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,779
Rym: Pretty much every gamer in the world has played Mario.

489
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:30,845
Scott: Well, actually, 1.36% have never played a single Mario game ever, any Mario game at all.

490
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:31,584
Rym: Huh.

491
00:27:31,584 --> 00:27:36,080
Scott: 6% say they played another Mario game, but not the original.

492
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:36,731
Rym: Yeah.

493
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:44,904
Rym: Well, it was just, it was crazy that this guy had never played Mario, because he looked like a young, kinda hip dude, and just the video of watching someone play it for the first time, even

494
00:27:44,944 --> 00:27:45,165
Scott: though, I

495
00:27:45,628 --> 00:27:47,900
Rym: gotta say, I wasn't that bad the first time I played Mario.

496
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,500
Scott: I wasn't that bad the first time I played Mario either.

497
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:54,200
Rym: I figured it right the fuck out, hit those question marks, get big, jump on things, get a fire flower.

498
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,180
Scott: Yep, I saw someone do it once before me, a little mediocrely, and then I was set.

499
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:05,540
Scott: As soon as I, my hard try was getting the controls, because I'd never used a gamepad before in my life, but as soon as I got that down, I was set.

500
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,959
Scott: I knew exactly what I wanted to do.

501
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,460
Rym: I found the first Warp Zone on my first time through that level.

502
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:10,080
Scott: Awesome.

503
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,799
Rym: 'Cause I saw I could jump up there, so I was like, ooh, maybe I'll break the game, and I jumped up there and there's a thing.

504
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:20,259
Scott: Yep, the Warp Zone, I think the first Warp Zone in 2-1 was the first thing I found on my own, a secret in any game.

505
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,200
Rym: Were y'all excited, and then you found out that everyone in the world knew about it?

506
00:28:24,501 --> 00:28:30,419
Scott: Nah, you know, it was still, I think it still had this sort of like, gleam, like ooh, the Warp Zone, even though everyone knew about it.

507
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,477
Scott: You know, it's like, ooh, you went to the Warp Zone, ooh!

508
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:40,540
Rym: Those are back in the days when I would throw the holy water in Castlevania 2 at every single goddamn brick in every single square of that game, looking for anything I could find.

509
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:44,000
Scott: You wanna hear the results of the other polls about Zelda and Final Fantasy?

510
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,779
Scott: They're gonna make you feel real bad.

511
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:49,000
Rym: Eh, we could save that for a show we should do on old school gaming.

512
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,579
Scott: Well, let me just, I'll just do it real quick.

513
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,259
Rym: Real quick!

514
00:28:51,381 --> 00:28:52,780
Rym: Okay, have you ever- 'Cause the show's already long.

515
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,440
Scott: I know, have you ever played the original Legend of Zelda?

516
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,198
Scott: There are, let's see.

517
00:28:57,222 --> 00:28:58,437
Scott: I'm just gonna do the no's.

518
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,920
Scott: Assume everyone else is yes, alright?

519
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:07,418
Scott: Anyone who isn't no either owns the cartridge, played it on the NES, or has a remade, emulated version.

520
00:29:07,418 --> 00:29:14,976
Scott: 17.33% say no, they have never played the original Zelda, but they've played other Zelda games.

521
00:29:14,976 --> 00:29:17,609
Scott: 6.5% have never played a Zelda game, ever.

522
00:29:20,861 --> 00:29:22,320
Rym: That's better than I expected.

523
00:29:22,544 --> 00:29:23,480
Rym: That's not so bad, really.

524
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,100
Scott: Original Final Fantasy.

525
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:33,617
Scott: 28.82% have never played the original Final Fantasy, but have played other Final Fantasy games.

526
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,640
Scott: About 13% have never played a Final Fantasy game, ever.

527
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:43,080
Rym: Eh, once again, kind of expected, considering that these games came out a long time ago.

528
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:48,080
Scott: I know, but only 26% of people have played Final Fantasy 1 on the original NES.

529
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:48,387
Scott: Yeah.

530
00:29:49,002 --> 00:29:49,699
Scott: Oh my god.

531
00:29:50,202 --> 00:29:52,559
Rym: I guess I'm no longer- Most people haven't.

532
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,679
Rym: I'm no longer jaded by those sorts of things.

533
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:03,920
Scott: Uh, uh, I'm telling you, nowadays in schools, you know, they give you the classic books to read, you know, the Shakespeares.

534
00:30:04,621 --> 00:30:07,039
Scott: In the future, they're gonna give you the classic video games.

535
00:30:07,501 --> 00:30:09,000
Scott: You gotta play Zelda, that's your homework.

536
00:30:09,481 --> 00:30:10,619
Scott: Bring it back and write an essay.

537
00:30:10,865 --> 00:30:11,058
Rym: Yeah.

538
00:30:11,662 --> 00:30:12,599
Scott: After you beat Ganon.

539
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:22,320
Rym: So anyway, we, we're gonna do something a little different today, because over the weekend, we had all but one member of the original, original core front row crew over.

540
00:30:23,461 --> 00:30:26,200
Rym: And we played games all weekend.

541
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,498
Scott: A whole lot of games.

542
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:42,879
Rym: Now, instead of reviewing all the games, or just talking about the weekend in general, which we might do another day, we're just really gonna go through every game we play the weekend, in order, and kind of do a half session report, half just thoughts on the game while we played it, what happened.

543
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:49,320
Scott: Yeah, we're gonna, you know, basically how our instance of the game happened and what we did and how other people played.

544
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:59,360
Rym: So I guess just consider this as a look into the gaming lives of Rym, Scott, Alex, Pete, and while Katsu wasn't there this weekend, he is very often right there with all of it.

545
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,919
Scott: And one guy at Moz.

546
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:01,509
Rym: Yeah.

547
00:31:02,424 --> 00:31:03,399
Rym: We'll just dig right into this.

548
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,380
Scott: Okay, so we get to Moz, which is where we played our first game.

549
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,900
Rym: Yep, it's a gaming group that we run the website for, it's actually on the same hosting.

550
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:10,293
Rym: Yep.

551
00:31:11,001 --> 00:31:15,538
Scott: And this guy there had a game that we'd never played before that looked kind of interesting called Timbuktu.

552
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:19,860
Rym: Now, he warns us ahead of time, "This game's a real brain buster.

553
00:31:20,321 --> 00:31:21,195
Rym: This game made my brain

554
00:31:21,236 --> 00:31:21,399
Rym: hurt.".

555
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,219
Scott: It's a deductive game.

556
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,780
Rym: It'll blow your mind, it's so difficult, you'll need a pen and paper.

557
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:32,475
Scott: And we were like, "Wait a minute, unless the instruction book says we can have pen and paper, we can't have

558
00:31:32,496 --> 00:31:32,536
Scott: it.".

559
00:31:32,883 --> 00:31:33,559
Rym: And it did say.

560
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,419
Scott: It did say we could have pen and paper, so okay.

561
00:31:35,741 --> 00:31:37,994
Rym: I was a little worried, I thought, "Is this game gonna be real

562
00:31:38,055 --> 00:31:38,678
Rym: complicated?".

563
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:44,919
Scott: Yeah, 'cause it didn't look that complicated, and then, you know, we actually got down to it and I read the rules.

564
00:31:45,402 --> 00:31:48,137
Scott: I was trying to ignore the guy explaining the rules, 'cause he's not good at explaining.

565
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:52,577
Scott: And I read them, and I was like, "Oh, this game is simple as all

566
00:31:52,598 --> 00:31:52,819
Scott: hell.".

567
00:31:53,140 --> 00:32:04,599
Rym: Now, we actually played the game, and we, you know, we start going through, and let's see, the game was, at least to me, well, you know what, I'll give my impression of it, then Scott can give his.

568
00:32:05,161 --> 00:32:06,200
Rym: The game was laughable.

569
00:32:07,281 --> 00:32:17,599
Rym: Before we even started playing, when I sat down and the cards were in my hand, and it clicked, and I realized how the game worked, I had fully, fully mathematically solved the game in my head.

570
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:23,558
Rym: I knew exactly what to do to win, no matter what, unless everyone else did the exact same thing.

571
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:25,100
Rym: And then it would be random chance.

572
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:30,300
Rym: I perfectly solved the game, and I made no decisions for the entire game.

573
00:32:30,441 --> 00:32:32,259
Rym: I just did exactly what the odds told me to do.

574
00:32:32,861 --> 00:32:33,451
Rym: And I won.

575
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,700
Rym: I had more points than everyone else combined.

576
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,336
Rym: I won.

577
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,740
Scott: You didn't have more points than everyone else combined.

578
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:45,140
Rym: I had over a hundred, I had like 170 points, and the rest of you, like one guy had 40.

579
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,540
Scott: We had like 90 something points.

580
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,033
Scott: Barely.

581
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,920
Scott: I think I had over a hundred points.

582
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:50,960
Rym: No one broke a hundred.

583
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:51,576
Rym: Except me.

584
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,040
Scott: We had lots of points.

585
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,340
Rym: In fact, I think I have the scores written down, because it was amazing.

586
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,200
Scott: It doesn't matter.

587
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,500
Scott: You didn't have more than everyone else combined.

588
00:32:57,721 --> 00:32:58,539
Rym: I'm pretty sure I did.

589
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:58,870
Scott: No.

590
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,859
Rym: None of you broke a hundred.

591
00:33:00,764 --> 00:33:01,474
Scott: We had 90s of points.

592
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,759
Scott: We had plenty of points.

593
00:33:02,901 --> 00:33:04,860
Rym: I only lost five goods in the whole game.

594
00:33:05,142 --> 00:33:05,229
Scott: Yeah.

595
00:33:06,362 --> 00:33:10,020
Scott: I, on the other hand, I figured the game out after the first round.

596
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:19,220
Scott: So the way the game kind of works, I'm just gonna be real quick, is you have these camels and you move them forward and you get these cards that tell you where the thieves are.

597
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,480
Scott: And you want to move the camels into places where there are no thieves.

598
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:30,940
Rym: Basically you just logically think and you know if you have a 150 or 25 percent chance of being thieved of any number of goods on a certain square.

599
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:31,819
Rym: And you just act accordingly.

600
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:31,905
Rym: Yep.

601
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,800
Scott: You know where one thief is and then eventually you know where three thieves are.

602
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,818
Scott: Three out of five thieves.

603
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:42,979
Rym: There was absolutely no decision making at all in this game, unless you really aren't smart enough to figure the game out.

604
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:50,640
Scott: In the first round, I just kind of... The problem was is that my initial placement of guys was really crummy.

605
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:59,431
Scott: So in the first round, after the first move and the first time I saw another thief, I was like, "Oh,

606
00:34:00,016 --> 00:34:00,359
Scott: okay."

607
00:34:00,782 --> 00:34:03,580
Scott: And then I knew exactly where to move all my guys for the rest of the game.

608
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:08,219
Scott: The problem was is my initial placement was terrible, like absolutely terrible.

609
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:19,299
Scott: So I ended up either having to pay a whole bunch of, you know, lose a whole bunch of goods to get my guys out of harm's way, or just lose a whole bunch of goods and it was about equal.

610
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:26,259
Scott: So in the first round, I lost a whole bunch of goods because my initial placement was based on basically randomness because I didn't know what to do then.

611
00:34:26,782 --> 00:34:30,580
Rym: Yeah, though honestly, initial placement doesn't seem to be a big deal.

612
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,440
Scott: It doesn't, but I put them all like in the same row.

613
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:34,438
Scott: That was my problem.

614
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:44,500
Rym: Granted, I'll note that in the third camel round, all but one of my camels were in fact in the same row, and I didn't have information about the two rows I could get to from there, and I still didn't lose any goods.

615
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:48,280
Scott: Yeah, well, that's actually the situation that happened to me in the final round, see.

616
00:34:49,647 --> 00:34:50,599
Scott: The game is five rounds.

617
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,760
Scott: So in round one, I lost a bunch because I didn't know what I was doing.

618
00:34:54,402 --> 00:34:59,200
Scott: In rounds two, three, and four, I didn't lose a single good because I knew what I was doing then.

619
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,340
Rym: But it was too late because I had lost no goods in the first round, too.

620
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:02,840
Scott: Yup.

621
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:08,040
Scott: So, and then in the final round, I ran into the same situation that RimRent just said.

622
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,400
Scott: he ran into where all his guys were in the same row and he had no information.

623
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:15,240
Scott: So I ended up losing two goods in the final round.

624
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:23,220
Scott: If I had known what I knew in the second round before the game started, I probably would have lost just as many goods as Rym lost.

625
00:35:23,584 --> 00:35:25,100
Rym: So the game was basically a no-brainer.

626
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:30,020
Rym: It was just, play the game, and the game is just the same thing, iterated five times.

627
00:35:30,641 --> 00:35:33,920
Scott: So once you-- You could play the game four, you could just do four rounds if you wanted to.

628
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:38,918
Rym: Once you've solved the game, like once you figure out how to win every time, there's no reason to ever play the game again.

629
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:39,472
Scott: Yup.

630
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,100
Rym: By the end of the game, we'd all figured it out and we were just done.

631
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:48,520
Scott: There was a different way to play the game where instead of starting with the default goods, you draft goods.

632
00:35:49,245 --> 00:35:55,820
Scott: And I'm trying to figure out if that will-- All that'll do is change your starting goods in addition to your starting position.

633
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,240
Rym: To me, all it does is make the deduction a lot easier.

634
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:04,418
Scott: I think it does make it a lot easier because you can either A, give your guys a bunch of diverse goods.

635
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:10,940
Scott: That way, if other people lose a whole bunch of goods, then you'll always have whatever's worth a lot.

636
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:16,139
Rym: Actually, I don't want to describe it now, but I thought about that and I came up with what I'm pretty sure is the optimal draft.

637
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:16,839
Scott: Yup.

638
00:36:17,144 --> 00:36:18,480
Rym: Or at least an optimal draft.

639
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:28,691
Scott: Because then I was thinking what you could do is, let's say your guy was gonna get thiefed of a valuable gold, you could instead sacrifice one of his worthless peppers to go somewhere else.

640
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,098
Rym: Well, yeah.

641
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,440
Rym: I'm just saying we probably shouldn't go into that much detail.

642
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,280
Scott: I'm not gonna go into that much detail, but yeah, that's Timbuktu.

643
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,598
Scott: It's a game worth playing once.

644
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:36,879
Rym: Once and only once.

645
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,360
Rym: There's no reason to ever play it again.

646
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,800
Scott: And then maybe, if you really want to, play it again with the draft rule.

647
00:36:42,223 --> 00:36:42,960
Rym: I just found it funny.

648
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:48,419
Rym: I mean, the guy we play with, the Moz guy, he's a cool guy, but he kept talking about how hard the game was.

649
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,660
Scott: And it wasn't hard at all.

650
00:36:49,921 --> 00:36:57,140
Rym: And I think he was kind of miffed that at the end of the game he was trying to talk about his strategy, and all four of us were like, "The game is just this.

651
00:36:57,462 --> 00:36:58,200
Rym: It's this equation.

652
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,299
Rym: It's this thing.

653
00:36:59,721 --> 00:37:00,376
Rym: There's nothing to

654
00:37:00,458 --> 00:37:00,499
Rym: it.".

655
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,028
Rym: And he was like,

656
00:37:01,048 --> 00:37:01,089
Rym: "Eh."

657
00:37:01,866 --> 00:37:02,080
Rym: Yup.

658
00:37:02,622 --> 00:37:04,460
Scott: It's sort of a wide open game.

659
00:37:05,203 --> 00:37:05,333
Scott: Yeah.

660
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,500
Scott: Alright, what do we play next?

661
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,560
Scott: We play Tinkers and Euphrates.

662
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,016
Scott: Yup.

663
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,260
Rym: One of our favorite games.

664
00:37:10,202 --> 00:37:11,759
Rym: I'd say it's my favorite game right now.

665
00:37:12,086 --> 00:37:12,319
Scott: Alright.

666
00:37:12,744 --> 00:37:14,140
Scott: We haven't played it in a while, though.

667
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,039
Rym: Yeah, and it felt real good to play it again.

668
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:16,565
Scott: It did.

669
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:17,658
Scott: It was pretty good.

670
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,571
Rym: Tinkers and Euphrates is a very difficult, complex game.

671
00:37:22,153 --> 00:37:24,300
Rym: to not explain how it works.

672
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:33,240
Rym: And once again, I ran away with the game, partly because I made a good position early on, and I made it so it wasn't easily attacked.

673
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:38,240
Rym: Scott and Alex and Pete, none of them attacked me, and then it was too late.

674
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:43,360
Scott: See, the thing is, I was getting ready to attack you, actually, with a black external conflict early on.

675
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,980
Rym: But I didn't put any black tiles in there.

676
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:49,679
Scott: No, I had my black guy down low, and all I needed was water tile tile to come in and get you.

677
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,059
Rym: Oh yeah, but I didn't put black tiles in there, specifically so you couldn't get any points from that.

678
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:58,218
Scott: I know I wouldn't get points from it, but I would get the half of the monument, which is good enough for me.

679
00:37:58,581 --> 00:38:01,080
Rym: I probably would have just internaled right back in, because I had four red tiles.

680
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,599
Scott: Yeah, but I had all my red guys.

681
00:38:03,266 --> 00:38:03,880
Scott: It doesn't matter.

682
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:10,195
Scott: The point was, is that, you know, Rym had the monument early, we could have challenged it, we didn't.

683
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,254
Rym: Honestly, Pete could have beaten me, because Pete did the same thing.

684
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:19,380
Rym: I did, almost, in the other corner of the board one round after me, and the game was just between me and Pete.

685
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:28,720
Scott: Yeah, I just, I was gonna build a monument, like, a turn or two later, and then someone put some tiles in the way of it or something, and I couldn't do it.

686
00:38:28,821 --> 00:38:29,579
Scott: It was really annoying.

687
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:29,933
Scott: Yeah.

688
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,900
Scott: But they didn't even realize they were blocking my monument, I don't think.

689
00:38:33,342 --> 00:38:38,859
Scott: I just had, like, two greens adjacent, I had two greens in my hand, and somehow, like, a black tile got over there in the way.

690
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:43,720
Rym: Yeah, well part of it is that I played a really completely off strategy from the way I usually play.

691
00:38:44,244 --> 00:38:46,560
Scott: I played off strategy, I played the way Pete usually plays.

692
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:51,020
Rym: Yep, and I played a new way, because usually I play the way Rym plays, which no one played that way this game.

693
00:38:51,300 --> 00:39:03,460
Scott: You know what, the way you played reminds me of the, now that I think about it, and I'm remembering, because he hadn't played it in so long, that was the way that I was playing right before we stopped playing, where I was building monuments right away and being all crazy.

694
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:10,040
Rym: Yep, though I know a good counter to it, but I didn't have to do it because no one else did what I did, except Pete, and he was too far away to use the counter.

695
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,820
Scott: I think I gotta go back to playing like that.

696
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,238
Scott: You know why?

697
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:19,280
Scott: Because not only, even if it doesn't win all the time, it's definitely more successful than playing the way I just played, and it's a lot more fun.

698
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:29,300
Rym: Yeah, well the way you played works really well, but the problem is, strategy, you can't just strategize outside the game, because wherever everyone starts initially, the game is totally different.

699
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:29,774
Scott: Yep.

700
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:36,559
Rym: Like, the strategy I picked worked so well, I think, mostly because no one else was in that area of the board.

701
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:42,000
Scott: So I should have really started in, when you didn't pick the normal middle starting place You should have started there.

702
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:42,698
Scott: I should have started there.

703
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,019
Scott: Because that's a damn good place.

704
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,280
Scott: I was, I was thinking of starting there with the green guy to scoop up treasures.

705
00:39:47,580 --> 00:40:01,180
Rym: Because I almost always start in this one place with my black and red guys, like I always start the exact same way, and the fact that I didn't, I chose a less optimal starting point, and no one chose the optimal starting point, at least the optimal in my mind.

706
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,540
Rym: You know, optimal to my strategy, not optimal to the game.

707
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:13,500
Scott: You know what else, if I think about this game that we just played, usually it feels like games have more and bigger conflicts than the one we just played has.

708
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:22,739
Scott: Well, I think that might be the fact that- The game did, if you think about it, it did have a bunch of conflicts that made the board crazy, but it didn't feel like the conflicts you usually have.

709
00:40:22,961 --> 00:40:28,419
Rym: Well, because Pete and I kept, you know, just pulling out whenever there was about to be a conflict, because we didn't want to give anyone else points.

710
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,320
Rym: Anytime anyone got close to me, I just abandoned a kingdom.

711
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:31,999
Rym: I just run away.

712
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,960
Scott: Yup, that was also part of the strategy I was using.

713
00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:36,640
Scott: I gotta go back to that.

714
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:43,196
Rym: Plus, honestly, while it didn't make me win, the fact that I had like 11 blue tiles in a row.

715
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,085
Scott: Yeah.

716
00:40:44,881 --> 00:40:47,521
Scott: I just- That was the thing, is another time in the game.

717
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:58,736
Scott: I was gonna go, "That's right, early on in the game I had 3 blue tiles, and I was gonna come after you, and then, as the turn, I was gonna do it, you laid out 3 blue tiles in the river behind

718
00:40:58,777 --> 00:40:58,858
Scott: you.".

719
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,355
Scott: And I said, "Okay, next

720
00:41:00,415 --> 00:41:00,658
Scott: turn.".

721
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:03,060
Scott: And then you laid out 3 more, and I was like- Well,

722
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:03,501
Scott: 2. 2

723
00:41:03,501 --> 00:41:04,287
Scott: more, and I was like,

724
00:41:04,751 --> 00:41:05,677
Scott: "Nooooo.".

725
00:41:06,081 --> 00:41:07,280
Rym: I just kept jumping those bastards out there.

726
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,860
Scott: And you just kept putting them out in the river, and I was like, "Well, there goes my

727
00:41:10,361 --> 00:41:10,446
Scott: plan.".

728
00:41:10,821 --> 00:41:15,740
Rym: I just kept drawing them, and I was pissed, because I needed red tiles, because I wanted to internal Pete out of his monument.

729
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,890
Scott: I so wanted to come after you with the blue, and you just kept laying them down, it was ugh.

730
00:41:20,081 --> 00:41:22,540
Rym: I didn't even put a blue guy in there for a while.

731
00:41:23,345 --> 00:41:24,260
Scott: It was just bad.

732
00:41:24,661 --> 00:41:27,660
Rym: I was hoping that you would connect our two kingdoms, right?

733
00:41:28,301 --> 00:41:36,340
Rym: And then you'd have the blue army, and then I was gonna pull my black dude out of his massive red fortification, internal your blue guy out, and then put my black dude back in.

734
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:36,827
Scott: Yeah.

735
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,220
Rym: But anyway, the game, that was a good game.

736
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,300
Scott: That was a good game.

737
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:40,959
Scott: What did we play next?

738
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,179
Rym: Then we played Attica.

739
00:41:42,942 --> 00:41:43,720
Scott: Oh, right, Attica.

740
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,560
Rym: Which was, the game basically was just between me and Alex, as to who would win.

741
00:41:47,925 --> 00:41:48,597
Scott: Yeah, you know.

742
00:41:49,581 --> 00:41:56,520
Rym: Well I don't wanna sound, I don't wanna gloat, but I'm pretty sure I've solved Attica, 'cause I've won like every time we've played it in recent memory.

743
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,220
Scott: Yeah, the thing about Attica is, I just, it's not my favorite game.

744
00:42:00,542 --> 00:42:00,817
Scott: Honestly?

745
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:08,000
Rym: I discovered, 'cause I was looking for a review of it to link to, and I just linked to Board Game Geek, but two people compared Attica to Puerto Rico.

746
00:42:08,608 --> 00:42:08,880
Scott: Really?

747
00:42:09,403 --> 00:42:11,318
Rym: Yeah, which I'm not- That's really weird.

748
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:18,379
Rym: Yeah, they, in terms of the level of thought and strategy and tactics, and I'm not sure if I agree with them at all.

749
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,119
Scott: I don't think I agree with them one bit.

750
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:24,160
Scott: Attica is so much less than Puerto Rico in terms of strategy and tactics.

751
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,020
Rym: See, I'm not sure yet.

752
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:37,619
Rym: The only thing I know is that about ten games ago, maybe eight or nine, I came up with a ratio of drawing and playing tiles, and a ratio of cards in my hand- Well, two to three, right?

753
00:42:38,025 --> 00:42:38,458
Rym: Actually, no.

754
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:38,727
Rym: Yeah.

755
00:42:39,161 --> 00:42:41,040
Rym: It changes as the game, it's really complicated.

756
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,660
Rym: I really can't write it down, but if you want, we could sit down and I could show it to you.

757
00:42:46,029 --> 00:42:46,217
Scott: Alright.

758
00:42:46,701 --> 00:42:55,099
Rym: And the ratio changes depending on how many of each Amphora-generating bit I've got, and based on how many cards are in my hand and whatever.

759
00:42:56,121 --> 00:42:58,779
Rym: And I play by this formula, and I always win.

760
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:00,340
Rym: But that was two player.

761
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:07,220
Rym: Then we played this four player game, and it worked just as well, except Alex went for the connect two temples and win strategy.

762
00:43:07,321 --> 00:43:08,059
Scott: Yeah, there you go.

763
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:12,560
Rym: And he was right there, and he almost did it, and basically, I couldn't stop him.

764
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,799
Rym: Pete could have stopped him, but chose not to.

765
00:43:15,242 --> 00:43:19,198
Rym: So, Scott, the only reason he stopped him is because he had a way to do it that didn't really hurt him.

766
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:23,239
Rym: It was neutral to Scott, and it prevented Alex from ending the game right then.

767
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,240
Rym: Which eventually caused me to win.

768
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:30,739
Scott: See, that's the thing I like about Attica, is the territory and the placement of the buildings.

769
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:41,779
Scott: What I don't like is that if the placement of the buildings just ends up kinda bleh, the game just turns into a race, and a race isn't really that fun to see who can build everything quick.

770
00:43:41,943 --> 00:43:42,740
Scott: It's kinda boring.

771
00:43:43,202 --> 00:43:47,240
Rym: Yeah, but the thing is, the race is usually over really quickly because there aren't many decisions to make.

772
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:47,839
Scott: I know, that's why.

773
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:55,460
Scott: I wish that the playing, the positioning of tiles was more important and more throughout the game.

774
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,680
Rym: See, I think it is more important.

775
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,760
Rym: The thing is, usually, the game is a foregone conclusion at some point.

776
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,600
Rym: There's a point at which you can say, "Alright, Scott's gonna win," or "Alright, Rym's gonna

777
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:04,670
Rym: win.".

778
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:09,580
Scott: Yeah, because it's only as if it doesn't matter where you place your late things.

779
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:13,739
Scott: Where you place your early things and where other people place the early things is what matters a lot.

780
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,660
Scott: And where the tiles are added can kind of matter a lot.

781
00:44:17,241 --> 00:44:21,900
Rym: I guess I wanna play the game more before I say if there's a lot to the game or not, but I do really like the game.

782
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,140
Scott: Yeah, I kinda like it.

783
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,080
Scott: It's not a bad game.

784
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:27,178
Scott: You know, I enjoy playing it, but it's not like, "Woo hoo, let's play

785
00:44:27,258 --> 00:44:27,520
Scott: Attica!".

786
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:28,333
Scott: It's like, "Alright, I'll play

787
00:44:28,354 --> 00:44:28,537
Scott: Attica.".

788
00:44:28,846 --> 00:44:29,079
Rym: Yeah.

789
00:44:29,682 --> 00:44:30,780
Rym: I guess I'm done two player.

790
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,660
Rym: I've solved two player.

791
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:34,320
Rym: I'm not sure yet if I've solved four player, so I wanna play it more.

792
00:44:34,644 --> 00:44:34,731
Rym: Yeah.

793
00:44:35,322 --> 00:44:50,680
Scott: I just wish that, you know, if it mattered where you put each and every building throughout the game and sort of like a territorial combat type of thing, that if it was more territory grabbing and less race to build everything, I would like it more.

794
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,819
Rym: Though I kinda like the race to build everything.

795
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:58,877
Rym: But that partly because it's like this mathematical web and I can just get my mind around it and it's fun.

796
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:02,500
Rym: But it's not fun because I'm playing a game with other people.

797
00:45:02,561 --> 00:45:04,779
Rym: It's fun because I'm doing all this math, which is weird.

798
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,740
Scott: Like I could play- The race, to me, feels no better than Candyland.

799
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:13,599
Rym: This'll sound weird, but I think I could play Attica with myself and enjoy it.

800
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:18,097
Rym: I think I could sit there and control all four guys and have a hell of a time playing that game.

801
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,679
Rym: Which, actually, I think I might do.

802
00:45:21,147 --> 00:45:21,359
Scott: Okay.

803
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,020
Rym: 'Cause I did that once with Settlers to prove to myself that the game was completely broken.

804
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:25,469
Rym: Yep.

805
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:26,191
Rym: Yeah.

806
00:45:26,783 --> 00:45:26,935
Scott: Okay.

807
00:45:27,604 --> 00:45:28,700
Rym: Then, that was the end of Moz.

808
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,160
Rym: We went and got Indian food.

809
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,240
Rym: Scott didn't eat much because he was- No, it'd be recent bargaining.

810
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:39,180
Scott: But I had a mango lassi, which is, you know, it's worth going to the Indian restaurant just for a mango lassi.

811
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:39,718
Rym: Yes, it is.

812
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,259
Rym: Actually, I really wish I could have one right now.

813
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:41,880
Scott: Yeah, that'd be good.

814
00:45:42,001 --> 00:45:42,840
Scott: We should learn how to make them.

815
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,560
Scott: It's just like yogurt and mango and something.

816
00:45:44,803 --> 00:45:44,894
Scott: Yeah.

817
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:47,419
Rym: It's just like, we could make- I'm sure we could make one.

818
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,960
Scott: It's yogurt, mango, and ice, and maybe something else.

819
00:45:50,303 --> 00:45:50,600
Scott: You know what?

820
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:50,891
Scott: A straw.

821
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,100
Rym: Let's try to figure that out before the weekend.

822
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:53,597
Scott: Good idea.

823
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:54,580
Rym: And then we'll make them at the shore.

824
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:55,679
Scott: We need mangoes.

825
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:56,518
Scott: We need yogurts.

826
00:45:56,841 --> 00:45:57,398
Rym: That'll be badass.

827
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:58,480
Scott: That would be badass.

828
00:45:58,563 --> 00:45:58,857
Scott: And ice.

829
00:45:59,540 --> 00:45:59,760
Rym: Alright.

830
00:45:59,901 --> 00:46:02,779
Rym: Anyway, then we went home after that.

831
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:03,837
Rym: We hung out a bit.

832
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,760
Rym: Then we played Four Swords.

833
00:46:06,728 --> 00:46:07,460
Scott: Oh, Four Swords.

834
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:10,080
Rym: Now, we're not going to talk in depth about Four Swords.

835
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,900
Scott: Not the Four Swords for the GBA, the Four Swords for the GameCube.

836
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:19,520
Rym: Suffice to say, Alex hadn't played it before, so he was not quite aware.

837
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:24,459
Scott: For a little while, before he got the hang of the game, he was sort of a ball and chain on the rest of us.

838
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,800
Rym: But then he figured it out right away.

839
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,420
Scott: Then he figured it out within a couple minutes and we were good to go.

840
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:32,576
Rym: But then we got to see his reactions to things like, "Oh shit, Rym has

841
00:46:32,736 --> 00:46:33,419
Rym: bombs."

842
00:46:33,806 --> 00:46:33,890
Rym: Or...

843
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:50,660
Scott: Yeah, it was kind of disappointing because we started our saved game in Death Mountain World 3 and there was no fire rods and barely any bombs and there wasn't any level 2 bombs and anything that's really exciting and crazy in that game didn't happen.

844
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:55,740
Rym: Granted, the fucking searchlights and the fact that we broke the game, but that's a story for another time.

845
00:46:55,840 --> 00:47:11,980
Scott: Yeah, Four Swords is great, but sometimes the only way we would make Four Swords perfect is if there are some times where you just get stuck and you don't know how to proceed and you need to solve some sort of non-obvious, it's not a typical Zelda puzzle.

846
00:47:12,922 --> 00:47:15,420
Scott: It's sort of like this weird mystery thing.

847
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:23,799
Scott: Like that one town in Faxanadu that was all misty and it wasn't just obvious how to get out of there and keep going in the game.

848
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:28,519
Rym: Yeah, at least most of the puzzles, if you just walk around, you'll figure it out.

849
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:36,860
Rym: Except we found one that we couldn't figure out and then it turned out that the game had broken and the key had disappeared and eventually the game just glitched itself to death.

850
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:42,045
Scott: Yeah, but there were other puzzles that we were stuck in, like running around looking for a moon.

851
00:47:42,086 --> 00:47:43,820
Scott: pearl took us a long time.

852
00:47:45,001 --> 00:47:48,500
Rym: Part of that was because we were infighting and yelling at each other a lot.

853
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,099
Scott: That is true, but that's supposed to happen.

854
00:47:50,582 --> 00:48:02,359
Scott: The thing is, the only thing that keeps that game from being super amazing instead of just awesome is the fact that sometimes you sit around for a long time milling about trying to figure out what to do next.

855
00:48:03,461 --> 00:48:06,520
Rym: Wii plus DS's could be like the baddest of ass.

856
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:10,840
Scott: If there was four swords for the DS or the Wii or a combination of both.

857
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,514
Rym: Hell yeah, just the DS.

858
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:12,820
Scott: Yeah, just the DS.

859
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:13,760
Scott: That would be the best.

860
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:17,859
Rym: Anyway, we should do a whole show on that, but we played this for hours yelling and screaming at each other.

861
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:18,953
Scott: Then we went to bed.

862
00:48:18,994 --> 00:48:19,219
Scott: I think.

863
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:19,928
Rym: Yeah.

864
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:20,594
Rym: Did we?

865
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,367
Rym: Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

866
00:48:21,387 --> 00:48:22,419
Rym: we just went to bed after that.

867
00:48:22,785 --> 00:48:22,999
Rym: Okay.

868
00:48:23,281 --> 00:48:26,160
Rym: Well, in addition to staying up late yelling at each other some more.

869
00:48:26,322 --> 00:48:26,640
Rym: Of course.

870
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:27,476
Rym: Yeah.

871
00:48:28,241 --> 00:48:28,800
Rym: So sad.

872
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:29,939
Rym: Well, then the next day.

873
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:31,900
Scott: What did we do the next day?

874
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:32,659
Scott: We played some games.

875
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:33,780
Rym: Yeah, we played a whole bunch of games.

876
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:34,639
Scott: What games do we play?

877
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:35,293
Rym: Vinci.

878
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:42,180
Scott: That's right, because Alex had purchased Vinci at the Dragon's Den store where Ma's meets.

879
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:42,612
Rym: Yep.

880
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:44,214
Rym: In fact, we might have played that Saturday night before.

881
00:48:44,234 --> 00:48:44,759
Rym: we played four swords.

882
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:59,740
Scott: It was a game that was on the discount rack and I had heard about this game on the Board Games To Go podcast and I was kind of interested in it, but I didn't buy it because someone told me there was something wrong with the version that was on sale there or something.

883
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,140
Rym: You know what?

884
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,300
Rym: The thing wrong with it is just a misprint in some of the rules.

885
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,000
Scott: Yeah, we printed out the rules from BoardGameGeek and we were good to go.

886
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:09,960
Scott: If there's anything else wrong with it, I'd like to know because we totally missed it.

887
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:20,457
Rym: We won't talk about the specifics of the game because that's going to be a whole episode, but it's basically build civilizations, decline those civilizations, drop them into decline, and then start new ones.

888
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:38,853
Scott: The idea is that declining civilizations that are big can still get you points, so you want to start declining your civilization while it's at its maximum, so that way you get points from your new civilization and you continue getting points from the old one at the same time because it's a race to see who gets 120 points first.

889
00:49:40,521 --> 00:49:53,297
Scott: So if you decline your civilizations at the right times and build your new ones well and get good ones, then you can get more points in less turns than everyone else and therefore win.

890
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:58,620
Rym: Now we're not entirely sure how deep the game is yet, but it's very fun, it's very challenging.

891
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,759
Rym: Pete won the first game and Alex won the second game.

892
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:12,200
Scott: I came real close to winning both times and I think that the difference between me winning and losing was, like, I could see very small things around the game that would have made the difference.

893
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:15,971
Rym: Yup, and a lot of it seems to be the actions of other players and the placement on the board.

894
00:50:16,525 --> 00:50:17,400
Scott: Like, in the second game.

895
00:50:17,441 --> 00:50:18,680
Scott: In the second game Rym got fucked.

896
00:50:19,001 --> 00:50:20,420
Rym: I was way ahead.

897
00:50:20,861 --> 00:50:27,265
Rym: I had made an awesome civilization and then I made another awesome civilization with rebirth and I was just shooting away.

898
00:50:27,285 --> 00:50:40,658
Rym: and then Pete had these mountain militia type guys and he in one round busted into the mountains, destroyed pretty much my entire civilization, and then just destroyed me.

899
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:42,260
Scott: And then I destroyed you a bit more.

900
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:47,460
Rym: And then Scott, like, swept up the remains and I went from winning to losing in one round.

901
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:56,560
Scott: Yeah, I think what this game comes down to is, you know, you look at the civilizations and what we've been doing is picking civilizations based on their merits alone.

902
00:50:56,860 --> 00:51:05,720
Scott: I think what you have to do is pick civilizations not just based on that, but based on the current situation of the board and based on what other players' civilizations have.

903
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:27,580
Scott: If everyone else has the extra point civilizations, like farming, mining, agriculture, you want to take the barbarians and that sort of, and the revolutionaries, to just destroy them so they don't get points and make a giant civilization that reduces them and then decline that and then take the points getting civilizations.

904
00:51:28,201 --> 00:51:34,480
Rym: But, I mean, anyway, the game's a lot of fun and we played it twice because it was that good and it was new and then Alex took it home with him so we couldn't play it again.

905
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:36,920
Scott: It is really good and I want to play Vinci a lot more.

906
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:42,445
Scott: You can play it online at this French website, but it has such a bad interface, it's not worth it.

907
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:47,000
Scott: It's not worth playing on the French website because the interface is so bad.

908
00:51:48,026 --> 00:51:48,519
Rym: It's a stinker.

909
00:51:48,961 --> 00:51:49,559
Scott: It's real bad.

910
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:50,456
Rym: All right.

911
00:51:50,761 --> 00:51:52,800
Rym: Now, we played a game of Fury of Dracula.

912
00:51:53,601 --> 00:51:54,177
Scott: Oh, Dracula.

913
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:56,680
Scott: Yeah, that wasn't the first thing we were playing.

914
00:51:56,921 --> 00:52:01,300
Rym: Well, Scott was the Dracula the first time we played way back and then I was a Dracula.

915
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:05,480
Rym: Pete was the most veteran of all of us who had not yet been Draculas.

916
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,259
Rym: We made him Dracula.

917
00:52:06,561 --> 00:52:07,840
Scott: And he sucked at playing Dracula.

918
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:08,358
Rym: We're sorry, Pete.

919
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:08,818
Scott: And he knows it.

920
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:10,880
Rym: You were the worst Dracula ever.

921
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:17,920
Scott: He was so, he was worst, I accidentally cheated as Dracula, but he freaking just cheated as Dracula like terrible.

922
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:18,578
Rym: But you know what?

923
00:52:18,782 --> 00:52:19,520
Rym: That didn't matter.

924
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:24,140
Rym: He would have lost anyway because he, all right, the hunters start in four places, right?

925
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:35,239
Rym: Now, he started, there were basically two cities, two places that were like the obvious places Dracula could start because they were the two points that were furthest away from all the hunters.

926
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:41,396
Rym: And instead of doing something clever or starting somewhere weird, he started in the most obvious place.

927
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:47,280
Rym: And basically I had decided, you know, I had a little plan and I was going to just march over that way and sweep.

928
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:51,216
Rym: And I marched straight over to him and unearthed him and he was like, "Ah, shits,".

929
00:52:51,738 --> 00:52:56,339
Rym: and I attacked him and he ran away to the sea and then he cheated by accident because he screwed up.

930
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:59,080
Scott: He thought that two seas were adjacent when they weren't.

931
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:04,900
Rym: And then he ran away more and then he cheated again and we killed him and there was no contest.

932
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,080
Rym: At no point could he shake us from the trail.

933
00:53:08,142 --> 00:53:09,600
Scott: No, he really, he had no chance.

934
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:16,299
Scott: As soon as he cheated that first time and we knew where he was, it was game over because he just pounced on him and chopped him up.

935
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,820
Scott: I think what really helped us win, and I think this is going to be the hunter strategy in the future.

936
00:53:20,902 --> 00:53:21,540
Rym: The starvation?

937
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:22,093
Scott: Yes.

938
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:25,800
Scott: You take events and items as much as you can in the early game.

939
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:35,540
Scott: As soon as you see Dracula and you're getting ready to deal with him, and you have enough events that you can beat Dracula, because we drew some pretty good events early on.

940
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:36,155
Scott: We loaded up.

941
00:53:37,621 --> 00:53:42,180
Scott: Use the events you have sparingly and don't draw new ones unless you're forced to.

942
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:46,680
Rym: Now I'd suggested this idea half-heartedly several times, but we'd never gone along.

943
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,019
Scott: We'd never really done it.

944
00:53:48,201 --> 00:53:50,197
Rym: This time we all looked at each other and we're like, "Let's do

945
00:53:50,217 --> 00:53:50,257
Rym: it.".

946
00:53:50,706 --> 00:53:50,959
Scott: Yup.

947
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:51,799
Rym: And it worked.

948
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:57,580
Scott: We just didn't take any events at all, and Dracula was totally starving for events.

949
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:58,639
Scott: He didn't have any.

950
00:53:58,980 --> 00:53:59,800
Scott: He couldn't escape.

951
00:54:00,341 --> 00:54:03,280
Scott: All he could use were his normal powers and his normal weapons.

952
00:54:04,403 --> 00:54:06,160
Rym: He must have felt such a different game.

953
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,060
Scott: And he drew really bad encounters.

954
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:15,680
Rym: When I played Dracula, I felt so powerful, and I was just walking around having my way with the board and just killing anyone who could hear me.

955
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:24,160
Scott: I felt so powerful, like I was doing all sorts of mischievous things, but I also felt so weird that I was me versus everyone, you know?

956
00:54:25,121 --> 00:54:26,940
Rym: So everyone won that game except Pete.

957
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:40,239
Scott: I think that the way I have to look at Dracula now is not as a game of hunters versus Dracula, but Dracula is the DM creating a good hunting experience for the hunters, and that's what it's really about.

958
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:54,219
Scott: So if someone's really good at staying away and keeping the hunters on edge, like maybe Dracula sometimes should let the hunters catch onto his trail a little bit to keep the game from getting sour, just to make it more fun.

959
00:54:54,560 --> 00:55:01,100
Scott: I think that's the way the game has to be looked at for maximum fun, because if you just look at it as plain versus, it's not so great.

960
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:04,400
Rym: Now the last game we played is one of our old favorites.

961
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:05,399
Scott: Well, you played Vinci again.

962
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,980
Rym: Well, yeah, but I said we played that twice.

963
00:55:07,741 --> 00:55:08,635
Rym: We played Amoré.

964
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:10,307
Scott: Amoré.

965
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:14,360
Rym: That is our favorite five player game, even though we played it four player, which is just as good.

966
00:55:14,703 --> 00:55:16,619
Scott: It's pretty close, but it's real damn good.

967
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,677
Rym: I can't think of a five player game I like more.

968
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,977
Scott: Uh, Calus is pretty good, but that's six players actually.

969
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:25,240
Rym: Amoré maxes out at five.

970
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:26,339
Scott: Yeah, so, hey.

971
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:33,637
Rym: Now, I won this one handily, because I tried a completely new strategy, well not a new strategy, but a strategy that-.

972
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,180
Scott: Well, first of all, we hadn't been playing Amoré correctly.

973
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:37,720
Rym: Yeah, a long time.

974
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:41,760
Rym: This time is the first time I had ever played the game correctly with the real rules.

975
00:55:41,981 --> 00:55:46,159
Scott: I think we played it correctly early on and then accidentally forgot the rules and messed them up.

976
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:47,020
Rym: Yeah, we just sucked.

977
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:49,940
Scott: And then playing it online, I learned the real rules.

978
00:55:50,500 --> 00:56:01,042
Rym: Yep, but I went with a whole new strategy this time, because way back we played a game with someone we really don't like and don't know anymore, but he- I don't know if he didn't understand the-.

979
00:56:01,062 --> 00:56:07,440
Rym: I'm not sure if he did this by design or by accident, but he didn't get a single victory point in the first kingdom.

980
00:56:08,181 --> 00:56:09,820
Rym: Then it ended and it was scored, he had zero.

981
00:56:10,621 --> 00:56:14,658
Rym: Then in the second kingdom he had a pile of money and he almost won the game, he came in second place.

982
00:56:15,941 --> 00:56:24,820
Rym: So, I played the strategy of get as much money as I can, I fucked the gods every step of the way, and I got all the money I could in the first kingdom.

983
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:29,331
Rym: And I built a bare minimum, I just built three pyramids, and I got some power cards and that was it.

984
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,720
Scott: Yeah, it was good to buy two power cards though.

985
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:33,009
Scott: Yes.

986
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,160
Scott: That's what I tried to do, is buy more power cards.

987
00:56:35,281 --> 00:56:38,100
Rym: I specifically avoided places that wouldn't let me buy more than one.

988
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:38,556
Scott: Yep.

989
00:56:40,524 --> 00:56:44,060
Rym: And I just ripped everyone's asses in the second kingdom.

990
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:49,060
Rym: I bought all the best provinces and I built giant piles of pyramids on them with my giant piles of money.

991
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:52,740
Scott: I'm beginning to think that's the way to go, because- Unless everyone goes that way.

992
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:59,900
Scott: Yes, that's true, but it seems from playing online, you know, like I really just not winning, but I'm doing okay.

993
00:57:00,761 --> 00:57:07,799
Scott: And I've won a couple times, but I try- I use the same strategy here that I use online, which doesn't really result in winning, I really should change it.

994
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:15,840
Scott: But for some reason it just doesn't, like when it comes to my turn to make a move, I look and I go, well that's the obvious move, and obviously that's not the right move.

995
00:57:16,281 --> 00:57:21,200
Rym: Well, I used to play the way where I'd try- I'd always try to build the most pyramids on at least one side in the first kingdom.

996
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:27,880
Scott: I did try to build the most pyramids on one side in the second kingdom, and the first kingdom, but- I think you got it in the first kingdom.

997
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,699
Scott: I did get it in the first kingdom, then in the second kingdom I got punned.

998
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:38,419
Scott: I was able to buy back my place that I had all those pyramids in, but the other places I built a ton of pyramids, I wasn't able to get back.

999
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:39,009
Rym: Yep.

1000
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:43,120
Rym: Mainly because I had so much money, and Pete also had an insane amount of money.

1001
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:56,420
Scott: I think what I should've done is put all those pyramids from the first kingdom in one place instead of getting the sets of pyramids, then I could've just gotten the one place and been set.

1002
00:57:56,780 --> 00:58:00,400
Rym: And Alex did really well because he got all the temples the first time around.

1003
00:58:01,288 --> 00:58:01,739
Scott: That's right.

1004
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:02,820
Scott: Got a pile of points.

1005
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:13,420
Scott: The one time I did win online was- no, the two times I won online were because of temples, and the thing- I was trying to get the temples, but Damanhur never came up, and there were only four players.

1006
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:23,260
Scott: See, Amun-Re with four players, not every province comes up, and that really screwed with me, 'cause online, every province always comes up, so I can just say, "I'll get Damanhur,".

1007
00:58:23,321 --> 00:58:24,620
Scott: and then it doesn't- it's not in the game.

1008
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:25,116
Scott: What do I do?

1009
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:25,648
Rym: Yep.

1010
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:30,320
Rym: Plus, now that I've played the game more, I've realized that bidding is a lot more important than I ever really decided.

1011
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,360
Scott: Bidding is very important.

1012
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:35,260
Scott: And I'm now willing to spend so much more to get the right province.

1013
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:40,259
Rym: I mean, I'd throw down 10 and 15 on provinces that only had, like, two pyramids on 'em.

1014
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:40,826
Scott: Mm.

1015
00:58:41,963 --> 00:58:42,399
Rym: That's true.

1016
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:42,849
Rym: Yeah.

1017
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:47,540
Rym: But it was a fun game, and we played it, and I think that was all the major gaming we did.

1018
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:48,759
Scott: Besides playing Vinci again.

1019
00:58:49,268 --> 00:58:49,500
Rym: Yeah.

1020
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,820
Scott: But I think we actually talked about both times he played.

1021
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:52,358
Rym: Yes, we did.

1022
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:55,700
Scott: I think the first time we played, we all just kinda fooled around.

1023
00:58:56,186 --> 00:58:56,439
Rym: Yep.

1024
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:57,037
Scott: Yeah.

1025
00:58:58,202 --> 00:59:00,319
Rym: Yeah, Vinci's the only- I didn't win Vinci, either time.

1026
00:59:01,122 --> 00:59:02,780
Scott: I think I wanna play that game a lot more.

1027
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,439
Rym: I do, 'cause I haven't figured it out at all.

1028
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,280
Rym: I got some vague notions.

1029
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,780
Scott: I got a little bit better than vague notions.

1030
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:15,360
Scott: I've got some right ideas about the timing of choosing declines, and how to choose your next civilization.

1031
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:23,840
Scott: Well, when we realized- But anything but end, I can kinda figure out, you know, the thing I'm unsure on is where the best place is to put civilizations, you know?

1032
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:29,438
Scott: Is it good to go after- is it better to just build a big place, or to screw someone else who's ahead of you?

1033
00:59:29,944 --> 00:59:31,157
Scott: That's a tough call, you know?

1034
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:38,180
Scott: Like, should you just screw over each player once, that way, you haven't been screwed?

1035
00:59:38,481 --> 00:59:39,300
Scott: Is that a good idea?

1036
00:59:39,582 --> 00:59:39,956
Scott: I don't know.

1037
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:50,000
Rym: Yeah, all I know is that we realized that it's kinda like F1, in that you have a pit strategy, because- That's definitely the- Declining a kingdom is like going into the pit.

1038
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,660
Rym: You can go with a three-pit strategy, or a four-pit strategy, and you gotta decide.

1039
00:59:54,720 --> 01:00:07,458
Scott: Yeah, it's kinda crazy that in a board game, the strategy of when and how many times to decline your civilizations is the same exact strategy as in Formula 1 racing of when to go into the pits.

1040
01:00:09,001 --> 01:00:11,531
Rym: We realized that, and it's gotten ahead a moment of, "Ahhhh...".

1041
01:00:13,821 --> 01:00:16,273
Scott: If only that, you know, your civilization went fa-.

1042
01:00:16,373 --> 01:00:17,398
Scott: Oh, your civilization does-.

1043
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:17,760
Scott: No.

1044
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:22,720
Scott: Civilizations seem to go faster when they have lots of fuel, not low on fuel, so it's sorta backwards.

1045
01:00:23,142 --> 01:00:23,228
Scott: Yeah.

1046
01:00:23,621 --> 01:00:29,240
Scott: When it's low on, you know, it's like, your civilization goes faster when it has more fuel.

1047
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:29,680
Rym: You know what?

1048
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:30,939
Rym: They're electric F1 cars.

1049
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,119
Scott: Yeah, awesome.

1050
01:00:33,742 --> 01:00:35,178
Scott: Awesome, that's exactly what they are.

1051
01:00:36,622 --> 01:00:38,460
Rym: Yeah, we played a whole bunch of board games.

1052
01:00:39,122 --> 01:00:40,840
Scott: And we just told you about all the ones we played.

1053
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:46,218
Scott: Okay, on Thursday of this week, so not tomorrow, but the next day- On to the Metabits.

1054
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,360
Scott: Yes, we are doing an episode of Ask Rimm and Scott.

1055
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:56,120
Scott: You can send in any question via audio feedback, email geeknights@gmail.com.

1056
01:00:56,501 --> 01:00:59,520
Scott: If you want audio feedback, just attach an MP3 or something to that.

1057
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:01,400
Rym: Also geeknights@frontrowcrew.com.

1058
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,139
Scott: Alright, geeknights@frontrowcrew.com.

1059
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:03,880
Rym: They're both the same.

1060
01:01:04,001 --> 01:01:04,499
Scott: They're the same.

1061
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:05,524
Scott: The front row crew.

1062
01:01:05,584 --> 01:01:09,240
Scott: one's probably better, 'cause that one's more guaranteed to work in the distant future.

1063
01:01:09,483 --> 01:01:09,675
Scott: Yes.

1064
01:01:10,461 --> 01:01:14,996
Scott: Or go to our forum, join, and there's a thread that says, "Ask Rimm and

1065
01:01:15,036 --> 01:01:15,357
Scott: Scott.".

1066
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:20,240
Scott: Ask any question you want, and we will spend all Thursday answering people's questions.

1067
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,180
Rym: We've got a lot of good questions, but we want more.

1068
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:26,460
Scott: We want as many questions as you can get, and we will try to answer as many as we can.

1069
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:27,130
Rym: Yep.

1070
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:36,338
Rym: Also, because we were asked to, and I would like to say this, even though this will be more of my news tomorrow, but for any of you who are considering going to Otakon, pre-register now.

1071
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:40,680
Rym: The deadline for the discount for early registration is the 4th of July.

1072
01:01:41,121 --> 01:01:51,640
Scott: Yeah, so if you do not go to the Otakon.com website and register for the convention now, or before January, July 4th, you will have to pay more money if you decide to go.

1073
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,720
Rym: Yes, it's definitely worth it to pre-register.

1074
01:01:55,501 --> 01:02:00,600
Scott: In fact, you should pre-register for Otakon as soon as possible to pay the least amount of money possible.

1075
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:04,460
Rym: Yeah, the only exception to that is if you are someone who does panels at cons.

1076
01:02:04,822 --> 01:02:05,900
Scott: In which case, you get in for free.

1077
01:02:06,021 --> 01:02:07,899
Scott: Or if you're press, legitimate press.

1078
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,100
Rym: You can't be pressed at Otakon.

1079
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:10,200
Rym: You can't be a bear.

1080
01:02:10,361 --> 01:02:15,120
Scott: Or if you're a guest, or if you're staff, then you don't have to register.

1081
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:15,536
Scott: Yeah.

1082
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:18,100
Scott: But all you normal people have to register.

1083
01:02:19,062 --> 01:02:21,220
Rym: A lot of their muggles out there.

1084
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:21,672
Scott: Yep.

1085
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,360
Rym: The unwashed masses.

1086
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:24,063
Scott: Mmm.

1087
01:02:25,525 --> 01:02:26,399
Scott: Any other bits?

1088
01:02:27,241 --> 01:02:32,179
Rym: I think that's it until tomorrow when we're going to do something we haven't been able to do in a long time.

1089
01:02:32,606 --> 01:02:33,039
Scott: What's that?

1090
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:34,489
Rym: We're going to review some goddamn anime.

1091
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:37,760
Scott: Holy crap, what anime are we going to review?

1092
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:38,680
Rym: I have no idea.

1093
01:02:38,903 --> 01:02:39,219
Scott: Awesome.

1094
01:02:40,942 --> 01:02:42,448
Rym: We have a backlog of all this stuff.

1095
01:02:42,468 --> 01:02:48,220
Rym: we watched months ago before con season started, and we haven't gotten around to doing any of it because we keep going to cons.

1096
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:51,980
Rym: And in fact, after the 4th of July, we're going to a con.

1097
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:52,967
Scott: Great.

1098
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:54,079
Rym: Yeah, Kinetacon.

1099
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:54,959
Scott: Okay.

1100
01:02:55,901 --> 01:03:00,199
Rym: And then we got Otakon coming up, and then it'll be Fall again, and all the Fall cons come.

1101
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,739
Rym: You know, Ubercon, and all those other ones.

1102
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:03,884
Scott: Uhhh.

1103
01:03:05,421 --> 01:03:05,898
Scott: Alrighty then.

1104
01:03:06,363 --> 01:03:06,577
Rym: Yeah.

1105
01:03:07,322 --> 01:03:07,759
Rym: We're out.

1106
01:03:15,641 --> 01:03:17,740
Rym: And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1107
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:20,379
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

1108
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:25,179
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontrowcrew.com.

1109
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:28,240
Scott: If you like our podcasts, you'll love our forums.

1110
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:29,177
Scott: Make sure you visit them.

1111
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,179
Scott: You can send your email feedback to geeknights@gmail.com.

1112
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,827
Scott: And if you want, you can leave us a voicemail at 206-333-1537.

1113
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:43,280
Rym: GeekNights airs every weeknight, Monday through Thursday.

1114
01:03:43,981 --> 01:03:47,220
Scott: GeekNights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

1115
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:51,080
Scott: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
