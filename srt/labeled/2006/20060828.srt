1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,990
Scott: It's Monday August 28th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,897
Scott: We talk about the miraculous bit.

3
00:00:16,258 --> 00:00:16,579
Scott: tauren.

4
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:21,768
Rym: Let's do this Well independently of one another.

5
00:00:21,848 --> 00:00:23,698
Rym: all three of us went out of town last weekend.

6
00:00:24,341 --> 00:00:25,304
Scott: Yep, yep, yep.

7
00:00:26,066 --> 00:00:30,560
Rym: I went to Albany to help our friend our friends Kate and Adam move into their new townhouse.

8
00:00:31,521 --> 00:00:33,870
Scott: I would have done that if I didn't go home to my parents house.

9
00:00:34,151 --> 00:00:36,259
Rym: Yep, and Alex also went out to his parents house.

10
00:00:36,744 --> 00:00:42,060
Rym: Holy crap It was a lot of heavy lifting on my part and it took until about two in the morning.

11
00:00:42,562 --> 00:00:47,240
Scott: I did a lot of heavy lifting at like IKEA, but I forgot an important piece to my bookshelf.

12
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:52,840
Rym: Oh, you mean the piece that the instructions say you have to buy the piece that is pictured and everything that you purchase the piece.

13
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,366
Rym: That was obviously necessary.

14
00:00:54,386 --> 00:00:54,647
Rym: Yeah.

15
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:57,236
Scott: Well, you know, I didn't know how to shop at IKEA.

16
00:00:57,377 --> 00:00:58,140
Scott: So what do you want from me?

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,084
Rym: Could I ask someone?

18
00:00:59,326 --> 00:00:59,647
Rym: I did.

19
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:00,592
Scott: they weren't very helpful.

20
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:01,940
Rym: What did you ask them?

21
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:05,699
Scott: I asked them where little metal bits were that held the shelves on.

22
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:08,808
Rym: I Didn't realize and he answered didn't?

23
00:01:08,848 --> 00:01:10,836
Rym: he told you where to buy the wall mounts.

24
00:01:11,157 --> 00:01:14,872
Rym: Yeah You didn't ask him where the cross braces were.

25
00:01:15,053 --> 00:01:16,499
Scott: I didn't know I needed a cross race.

26
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,073
Rym: Nor did you ask him if you had everything you needed?

27
00:01:19,756 --> 00:01:27,940
Scott: No, no No, so the blame falls squarely on Scott Lloyd Rubin also making IKEA not the easiest place to shop.

28
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:29,720
Rym: I thought it was perfectly easy.

29
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:39,740
Rym: You look in the instructions and it says pretty much if you bake this kind of shelf You need a cross brace and then in the picture of the shelf you're making it shows the cross brace.

30
00:01:39,821 --> 00:01:41,815
Scott: I didn't really read the direction so well.

31
00:01:42,097 --> 00:01:47,899
Rym: Oh, oh Yeah Good game Scott.

32
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:59,159
Rym: But to not bore you with all the details of our mostly unexciting weekends other than the fact that we just got a new board Game that we've been playing a lot and it's a lot of fun, but we're not sure if we like it or not yet.

33
00:01:59,882 --> 00:02:03,052
Scott: Well, I think I like it in terms of it's fun to play.

34
00:02:03,192 --> 00:02:05,439
Scott: the question is how long will it be fun to play?

35
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,092
Scott: and The strategy but that's for a Tuesday.

36
00:02:08,455 --> 00:02:13,571
Rym: It is though I will note that I just creamed in fact between me Alex and Scott.

37
00:02:13,652 --> 00:02:16,620
Rym: Scott only got three points higher game.

38
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,349
Scott: Well, I won the first time we played the second time we played.

39
00:02:19,369 --> 00:02:20,292
Scott: I had a good showing.

40
00:02:20,353 --> 00:02:26,695
Rym: the latest time we played I got hosed See in the three times we play I was in dead.

41
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:27,840
Rym: last by a lot.

42
00:02:28,302 --> 00:02:31,960
Rym: I was in the middle of the road pretty much right in the middle and then I won by a lot.

43
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,770
Scott: So my performance was inversely proportional to yours.

44
00:02:36,111 --> 00:02:36,773
Rym: Yeah, pretty much.

45
00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:38,858
Rym: and then Alex just did really well.

46
00:02:39,038 --> 00:02:39,560
Rym: Yeah, generally.

47
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,523
Scott: Yeah, I think so.

48
00:02:41,964 --> 00:02:42,626
Rym: All right.

49
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:43,609
Rym: Anyway in the news.

50
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:47,300
Rym: This is a little bit old, but it's something that really bothered me.

51
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:58,283
Rym: I mean everyone who knows me in the real world nor in meatspace Knows that there are certain issues that even if I don't say anything or if I just let it got by You know There's that glimmer of.

52
00:02:58,644 --> 00:03:04,359
Rym: if I felt like it there would be a torrent of me talking about the topic ad nauseum.

53
00:03:05,484 --> 00:03:06,709
Rym: Maybe a bit of frustration.

54
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,920
Rym: Usually these things are pseudoscientific things.

55
00:03:10,022 --> 00:03:11,909
Scott: We just can't stop yelling about those.

56
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:19,591
Rym: I mean someone says the word chiropractic and I just think And it really it really takes effort to not say anything.

57
00:03:19,611 --> 00:03:20,193
Rym: Mm-hmm.

58
00:03:20,715 --> 00:03:23,822
Rym: And another one of those issues is Ecoterrorism.

59
00:03:24,244 --> 00:03:29,947
Rym: now not the fact that it exists or when people talk about it But when it affects the world or when it happens.

60
00:03:30,047 --> 00:03:35,785
Rym: and recently the world has lost a great scientist due to eco terrorism What did they kill him?

61
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:50,940
Rym: Well, basically Dario Renok I don't know if I'm pronouncing his name, right but he is a well-respected Neuroscientist from UCLA and from what I read on slashdot and articles about him I don't remember exactly what he did and I don't feel like doing any fact-checking tonight.

62
00:03:51,662 --> 00:04:02,139
Rym: But I read that he has done all sorts of fantastic things and he has put forth a lot of Somewhat significant advancements in the various fields surrounding neuroscience new neuroscience.

63
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,371
Rym: Yeah I can't go into more detail than that because I don't know.

64
00:04:05,391 --> 00:04:07,720
Scott: I don't know anything about neuroscience either.

65
00:04:07,944 --> 00:04:13,039
Rym: See, I looked it up at work But then I got distracted by you know work and then I never bothered to finish looking it up.

66
00:04:13,661 --> 00:04:13,962
Rym: Awesome.

67
00:04:14,102 --> 00:04:23,066
Rym: But anyway, he and his family had been harassed or much of his career by eco terrorists and Why would they be harassing a neuro sign?

68
00:04:23,086 --> 00:04:27,760
Rym: Well, because he's a neuroscientist who among other things occasionally experimented on monkeys.

69
00:04:27,981 --> 00:04:28,787
Scott: Well, you need to.

70
00:04:28,807 --> 00:04:30,619
Scott: you're gonna test on human brains.

71
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:32,684
Rym: see, I'm not gonna.

72
00:04:32,965 --> 00:04:53,233
Rym: I'm not gonna worry about the issues of you know, why eco terrorists do what they do or Why people care other than the fact that to all the people out there who are staunchly against animal testing in any form I'll know that animal testing has come a long way and it's really not as bad as groups like PETA really want to portray it as.

73
00:04:53,253 --> 00:04:59,049
Scott: and I say no matter how bad it is one Person greater than animal see I disagree.

74
00:04:59,149 --> 00:05:02,620
Rym: I've met a lot of people where I would put a puppy's life ahead of them.

75
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,954
Rym: No, there were pretty bad people are pretty annoying people.

76
00:05:06,617 --> 00:05:07,140
Rym: You would have to.

77
00:05:07,684 --> 00:05:11,688
Rym: Alright, here's a question for you Who would you rather have living in our house right now?

78
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:15,989
Rym: a puppy that was quiet and well-behaved that I had trained Didn't even poop in the house.

79
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:17,018
Rym: I've did everything outside.

80
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:21,679
Rym: or He who shall not be named he who lived with Pete.

81
00:05:22,702 --> 00:05:34,130
Scott: It would be more interesting to have he who shall not be named Because unlike some other people who would allow their lives to be ruined by he who shall not be named I would ruin the life of he who shall not be named.

82
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,080
Scott: I don't think you could and achieve great entertainment from it.

83
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,127
Rym: That's like saying I'm gonna hurt that masochist.

84
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,392
Rym: I'm gonna hurt him real bad.

85
00:05:40,412 --> 00:05:41,415
Rym: That's right.

86
00:05:41,616 --> 00:05:42,399
Scott: That's what I'm gonna do.

87
00:05:42,881 --> 00:05:55,020
Rym: Alright, how about a nice well-behaved clean puppy or an amalgam of stinky Rob's body Dwayne's brain pre giving up marijuana and Hitler's mustache?

88
00:05:56,403 --> 00:05:57,429
Scott: Hey Hitler's mustache?

89
00:05:57,489 --> 00:06:01,653
Scott: interesting that would definitely Be more interesting.

90
00:06:01,753 --> 00:06:06,890
Rym: Well anyway Nothing I mean, I mean I am against.

91
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,060
Rym: you know there I mean there is some gratuitous animal research out there.

92
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:28,140
Rym: Luckily that is diminished over the years and a lot of places like cosmetics a lot of cosmetics aren't tested anymore because they're using Really well-known chemicals that have been tested in the past and there's really no reason to test these things further Mmm, so if someone was still testing, you know, like I'm gonna keep injecting this deodorant into this rate.

93
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,289
Rym: These are cats eyes for a hundred years.

94
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:31,032
Rym: Let's just stupid.

95
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:38,022
Rym: Mmm or a guy who's like I'm gonna boil a monkey just to see what happens that that's not cool Point.

96
00:06:38,063 --> 00:06:40,995
Rym: other than I'm sure pen would have a lot to say about that.

97
00:06:41,015 --> 00:06:42,260
Rym: I'm sure he would laugh hysterically.

98
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:48,018
Rym: I don't think that it is worth either the monkeys pain or the possible entertainment pen would get.

99
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:55,758
Scott: yeah I I'll agree that you know, okay if I have a choice between saving a person and saving a monkey I'm probably gonna say it's time for the monkey to go.

100
00:06:56,462 --> 00:07:01,238
Scott: But if you're just gonna kill a monkey for no reason, I'm gonna say what the hell don't kill that monkey.

101
00:07:01,258 --> 00:07:07,663
Scott: for no reason We might be able to use that monkey's life to save a human life or possibly Another monkey's life.

102
00:07:07,703 --> 00:07:13,040
Rym: I mean there are cats that get insulin shots because they have diabetes.

103
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,326
Rym: Wow, yeah, so it.

104
00:07:15,506 --> 00:07:17,391
Rym: animal testing also helps animals.

105
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:19,155
Rym: to all you dirty hippies out there.

106
00:07:19,196 --> 00:07:20,579
Scott: Did the cats hurt when they pee?

107
00:07:23,063 --> 00:07:24,356
Rym: Take it out of my wife and dog.

108
00:07:25,781 --> 00:07:26,407
Scott: How's the cat?

109
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:27,334
Scott: take it out of the dog?

110
00:07:27,374 --> 00:07:28,060
Scott: That's interesting.

111
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:32,211
Rym: I You know what I've noticed.

112
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:38,355
Rym: we can't with diabetes While we're losing it today, it's over.

113
00:07:38,515 --> 00:07:39,400
Scott: it's a cat with diabetes.

114
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:47,193
Rym: I Tell you now out there seriously that we don't find diabetes funny.

115
00:07:47,353 --> 00:07:48,918
Scott: Yeah, my grandpa had diabetes.

116
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:56,879
Scott: Yeah I'm not kidding But a cat with diabetes is hilarious anyway.

117
00:07:58,141 --> 00:08:16,050
Rym: There's the thing is I trust the scientific community and the people who do this research because I know people personally who do Research like this or who facilitate this research that the scientists do it because they feel that what they are doing will benefit the world or benefit mankind and It is they.

118
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,080
Rym: they put a lot of thought into it.

119
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,380
Rym: There are a lot of ethics involved and a lot of scientists will refuse to do research.

120
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:26,820
Rym: That is just obviously stupid or harmful without any reasonable benefit or gratuitous or whatever.

121
00:08:27,362 --> 00:08:33,931
Scott: It's not like back in the day when you had like crazy Russian and you know Nazi scientists who would just do whatever the hell they want to do.

122
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,380
Scott: mad science, you know, it doesn't happen anymore.

123
00:08:36,982 --> 00:08:40,539
Scott: Scientists actually know what they're doing and they won't do bad things.

124
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,889
Scott: I mean someone who's sitting around going.

125
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:45,920
Scott: I need to cure AIDS trying to figure out how to cure AIDS.

126
00:08:46,001 --> 00:08:49,060
Scott: It's gonna be like let me totally mutilate some monkeys.

127
00:08:50,121 --> 00:08:50,783
Rym: Boil a monkey.

128
00:08:50,803 --> 00:08:51,887
Rym: see if that kills the AIDS.

129
00:08:52,088 --> 00:08:55,180
Scott: Yeah, they're not doing that shit because they're smart now.

130
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:06,060
Rym: Despite this this this man who apparently had tested on monkeys was a well-respected well-known Neuroscientist who'd contributed volumes of work and data and experience and knowledge to the scientific community and it advanced mankind.

131
00:09:06,722 --> 00:09:13,345
Rym: he'd been harassed and his family had been harassed for years by various activists and Just recently.

132
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:15,780
Rym: He decided that he's going to retire.

133
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:25,869
Rym: He's given in to these effectively terrorist demands or feared not so much for fear of his life and not even so much for Family's life but for fear for the lives of people around him.

134
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:41,600
Rym: because just recently these eco terrorists tried to firebomb Something it was either his house or facility he worked at and they accidentally left one of their Molotov cocktails on just like a neighbor's porch and He said he's had enough.

135
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,558
Rym: He's not going to risk people's lives for his research and he's given up.

136
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:48,653
Rym: The world is lost to scientists because of what are effectively terrorists.

137
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:49,656
Scott: Okay.

138
00:09:49,696 --> 00:09:53,929
Scott: Well number one How can you tell someone that they're bad?

139
00:09:54,089 --> 00:10:03,260
Scott: for even if he was killing monkeys just killing tons of monkeys How can you tell you him that he's bad when you're fire bombing people with Molotov cocktails?

140
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,579
Rym: I guess their rationale is that if I kill this one man, I'll save a whole bunch of monkeys.

141
00:10:08,282 --> 00:10:15,400
Scott: Okay, number two if I was this guy, I would say I was quitting science and continue science in secret.

142
00:10:16,263 --> 00:10:17,067
Rym: Oh, maybe he is.

143
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:18,111
Rym: he's smart.

144
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:18,974
Rym: He's smarter than us.

145
00:10:19,557 --> 00:10:25,437
Scott: number three If a guy was outside my window with Molotov cocktails, I would shoot him.

146
00:10:25,457 --> 00:10:27,971
Rym: now The thing that bothers me is not.

147
00:10:28,031 --> 00:10:29,259
Rym: I mean not only.

148
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:35,000
Rym: I mean I don't want to use the word hippies because hippie is a really broad term and I don't now it's a broad term.

149
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,947
Scott: Yeah, it used to be more specific.

150
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:40,920
Rym: Yeah, so I guess I want to use the phrase dirty hippies when I answer.

151
00:10:41,201 --> 00:10:49,212
Rym: When I say dirty hit the one I don't even really mean people who just happen to not bathe and happen to be very free Or happen to be very spiritual.

152
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:49,433
Rym: Yes.

153
00:10:49,493 --> 00:10:50,379
Scott: Those are plain hippies.

154
00:10:51,383 --> 00:10:56,800
Rym: When I say dirty hippie, I effectively mean eco terrorists pseudo scientists and all that tomfoolery.

155
00:10:57,582 --> 00:11:00,260
Rym: Yeah, and they they do these things.

156
00:11:01,121 --> 00:11:05,254
Rym: Yet they're really not given the label terrorists despite the fact that they're terrorists.

157
00:11:05,555 --> 00:11:07,300
Scott: Well, some of them are given the label terrorists.

158
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:07,983
Rym: Well, here's the thing.

159
00:11:08,526 --> 00:11:25,398
Rym: There are organizations a lot of them in the u.s That pretty much promote all of these terrorist acts straight up and openly Mm-hmm, but yet they always say and the courts always hold up that they're not responsible when these things happen because they didn't Directly do it.

160
00:11:25,681 --> 00:11:33,080
Rym: They just happen to post this guy's address and they just happen to post molotov cocktail Instructions and someone just happened to follow these instructions.

161
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,891
Rym: They didn't take direct action and very rarely.

162
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:38,300
Rym: but then how come like how can we go after Hezbollah?

163
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,562
Scott: Yeah, well, how come?

164
00:11:40,184 --> 00:11:44,637
Scott: I say all sorts of things, you know, sometimes like oh what if I did this?

165
00:11:44,697 --> 00:11:47,731
Scott: and you always say But then you're telling someone to do that.

166
00:11:47,751 --> 00:11:49,340
Scott: You can't tell someone to do bad things.

167
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,971
Rym: See, there's a real fine line and a couple of these people have gone down before.

168
00:11:53,091 --> 00:12:01,813
Rym: no, but the sad fact remains that you know Hezbollah maybe might not do anything directly But then someone does something in their name and then oh we can't blame Hezbollah.

169
00:12:01,913 --> 00:12:10,409
Rym: or the thing is we do blame Hezbollah but then someone does something in the name of the animal liberation front and Oh, well, that wasn't us.

170
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:11,494
Rym: That wasn't them.

171
00:12:11,555 --> 00:12:12,499
Rym: That was just some crazy.

172
00:12:12,801 --> 00:12:21,317
Scott: What bothers me more right is of course the people doing Terrorist acts like bombing stuff are way out of control and you know, that's a separate thing.

173
00:12:21,538 --> 00:12:21,959
Scott: forget them.

174
00:12:22,662 --> 00:12:31,000
Scott: It's the people right under them the people who sort of agree with what those Terrorists are fighting for but aren't evil and doing terrorism.

175
00:12:31,461 --> 00:12:47,813
Scott: The problem I have is that those hippies that aren't actually terrorists but agree that you know You shouldn't test on monkeys or whatever Those are generally good people with good intentions, you know, like they want good Yeah, I don't want evil but they're just.

176
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:57,870
Scott: they don't understand They're ignorant or they're dumb or they're doing used or they're being used like someone is just you know Feeding them false information.

177
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:03,833
Rym: petta petta Michael Moore Even though Michael Moore is not nearly so bad cuz at least he's entertaining.

178
00:13:03,853 --> 00:13:05,017
Rym: There's nothing funny about PETA.

179
00:13:05,138 --> 00:13:10,860
Rym: That's true But you know and oh as an aside don't forget the head of PETA is diabetic.

180
00:13:12,366 --> 00:13:13,552
Rym: She uses insulin.

181
00:13:13,632 --> 00:13:15,400
Rym: Oh, but we tested insulin on animals.

182
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:25,780
Scott: Yeah But the point is is that these people if you know anyone else had, you know Given them the correct information would be on the good road.

183
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,800
Rym: They'd all be cool or in the very least they might say be rational about it.

184
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:39,620
Rym: Like I still disagree with the animal testing because I am against science and whatever But I'm not going to kill people because my belief the thing is is you know, someone could be evil.

185
00:13:40,268 --> 00:13:45,660
Scott: someone could be Rationally or irrationally evil and it doesn't matter either way because the result is the same.

186
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:52,080
Scott: Well, yeah, but someone can be rationally or irrationally good and it's the irrationally good people that it's like.

187
00:13:52,544 --> 00:13:53,618
Scott: What do I do with you?

188
00:13:53,921 --> 00:13:59,211
Scott: You won't listen to me because you're not Rational, but you're not doing good like you want to.

189
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:02,080
Scott: you're doing bad because you don't know any better.

190
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:06,297
Rym: I mean, there are a lot of environmentalists that really care about the environment.

191
00:14:06,337 --> 00:14:09,199
Rym: they get active, you know They work on recycling programs and they do good things.

192
00:14:09,903 --> 00:14:13,280
Rym: Then there are a lot of environmentalists who they don't know much about it.

193
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,620
Rym: So like they'll campaign against nuclear power because they think it's dangerous.

194
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:21,596
Rym: They think they're doing a good thing when really nuclear power is probably the cleanest form of energy.

195
00:14:21,636 --> 00:14:25,720
Scott: We have yep It's like oh, I just don't know what to do with those people.

196
00:14:25,881 --> 00:14:29,781
Scott: The worst part is it's like I'd rather have the rational evil guy Cuz.

197
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:33,620
Scott: at least I can talk to him and he'll talk back in a way that makes sense.

198
00:14:33,721 --> 00:14:44,069
Rym: Yeah, and if he's saying the wrong thing, I mean if you went up to Emperor Palpatine You know after you know in the fourth fifth sixth movies of Star Wars and you say you know, you said hey You're an evil fuck.

199
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:49,420
Scott: He would say Yep, and then he'd zap you with his lightning and you'd say yeah, that's about what I expect.

200
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,896
Scott: Yeah, you might say at least you know what you're getting, you know, the irrationally good people.

201
00:14:54,197 --> 00:14:56,646
Scott: It's like oh They hurt so much.

202
00:14:57,107 --> 00:14:58,191
Rym: now that the worst part is.

203
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:05,677
Rym: I mean at least I can almost Understand what went through these guys tiny little brains because you know, he's testing on monkeys.

204
00:15:05,717 --> 00:15:10,329
Rym: So we'll kill him Apparently in 2001. the ELF.

205
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,033
Rym: I don't know what that stands for.

206
00:15:12,054 --> 00:15:12,896
Rym: It's one of those groups.

207
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:20,579
Rym: It stands for elf, you know, like Rivendell they bombed a facility at the University of Washington for kind of the same reasons.

208
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:26,240
Rym: now You might think oh was it the facility of monkey testing or the facility of crushing cats?

209
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,287
Scott: It was like a planetarium or something wasn't it?

210
00:15:28,307 --> 00:15:36,108
Rym: It was the University of Washington Center for Urban horticulture Plants nothing but plants.

211
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:48,300
Rym: they were studying how to grow plants in cities, basically But they happened to have done a little bit of genetic engineering on these plants.

212
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,418
Rym: That is why these dirty hippies bombed it.

213
00:15:54,265 --> 00:16:09,720
Rym: Yeah, I don't think I need to go in anymore because I don't want to turn this into the episode of Rym bitches about eco Terrorists dirty hippies and pseudoscience, but suffice to say I really don't like eco terrorists dirty hippies pseudoscience and I was gonna say someone's name just to be funny, but never mind.

214
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:13,256
Scott: Well get ready for fun cuz we're gonna bitch and moan about DRM now.

215
00:16:13,296 --> 00:16:13,959
Rym: God damn it.

216
00:16:15,821 --> 00:16:28,900
Scott: So Windows Microsoft Windows and Windows Media format have a DRM Schema, I guess you would call it known as plays for sure plays the number four and then sure as opposed to Apple's fair play.

217
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,768
Rym: All right, that's somewhat painful because it's not even lead speak.

218
00:16:31,808 --> 00:16:34,295
Rym: It's just like cutesy aim speed.

219
00:16:34,656 --> 00:16:39,638
Scott: Yeah, so if you buy you know an mp3 player that supports plays for sure.

220
00:16:39,658 --> 00:16:44,685
Scott: or you have Windows Media Player or You know anything like that.

221
00:16:44,825 --> 00:16:48,276
Scott: you can get plays for sure DRM files and play them.

222
00:16:48,436 --> 00:16:49,460
Rym: do those files even exist?

223
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:53,140
Scott: Yes, you can get plays for sure DRM files.

224
00:16:53,301 --> 00:16:58,620
Scott: I think if you sign up to Napster or a couple other of the you know, those pay services.

225
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:01,379
Scott: I think they provide you with plays for sure files.

226
00:17:02,423 --> 00:17:13,460
Scott: now the way some of those services work is you basically pay monthly to like maintain your account and Then you get so many songs, but you can also buy more songs.

227
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,209
Scott: I'm not exactly sure if they specific.

228
00:17:15,229 --> 00:17:15,791
Rym: is this one of those?

229
00:17:15,813 --> 00:17:17,180
Rym: when you stop paying you lose access.

230
00:17:17,563 --> 00:17:19,940
Scott: Exactly when you stop paying you lose your songs.

231
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:25,152
Rym: That's such a bad idea for so many reasons no matter how you feel about DRM.

232
00:17:25,172 --> 00:17:26,015
Rym: That's a bad idea.

233
00:17:26,175 --> 00:17:27,298
Rym: Yep now can't okay.

234
00:17:27,378 --> 00:17:35,185
Scott: anyway some guy came up with this program called fair use the number four and then the WM.

235
00:17:35,246 --> 00:17:37,240
Scott: so fair use for Windows Media.

236
00:17:38,281 --> 00:17:42,920
Scott: It removes the encryption and the DRM from plays for sure files.

237
00:17:44,061 --> 00:17:44,502
Rym: You know what?

238
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:51,500
Rym: This guy is probably one of the closest men or women to being given the title of a GeekNights.

239
00:17:52,022 --> 00:17:53,527
Scott: Yeah, it's like DVD yawn.

240
00:17:53,547 --> 00:17:54,972
Scott: and then this guy.

241
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:57,200
Rym: Yeah, I'm real happy with this guy.

242
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:03,800
Rym: In fact, I think he I'm going to nominate him as the first possible candidate for this year's GeekNights possibly possibly Anyway.

243
00:18:04,941 --> 00:18:12,225
Scott: So like one guy was writing an article like please Microsoft don't patch The DRM.

244
00:18:12,285 --> 00:18:14,975
Scott: to fix this we want to be able to use this program.

245
00:18:15,015 --> 00:18:16,059
Scott: Please don't patch it.

246
00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:18,467
Rym: Wait, please Microsoft.

247
00:18:18,808 --> 00:18:23,806
Rym: Don't fix this obviously glaring hole in your failing DRM scheme Exactly.

248
00:18:23,846 --> 00:18:41,240
Scott: Well as we know it is Technologically impossible to create a DRM scheme that is foolproof because you are essentially giving someone something but you're giving it to them inside of a safe and then you're giving them the key and You just have you know some sort of mechanism on the safe where the key only works at certain times.

249
00:18:41,683 --> 00:18:43,760
Scott: But they have the key and they have the safe.

250
00:18:44,101 --> 00:18:52,069
Scott: So eventually they're going to figure out how to open the safe and keep it open and even then you can always figure it out Because of the analog hole.

251
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,657
Rym: I think I need an analog hole.

252
00:18:53,677 --> 00:18:54,420
Scott: Yeah, there's a hole.

253
00:18:54,721 --> 00:19:00,305
Scott: There's a hole in the back of the safe that they can peek into and eventually they'll figure out how to suck Whatever's in there out that hole.

254
00:19:00,325 --> 00:19:03,115
Rym: if anyone feels like it try to make us an audio.

255
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:06,548
Rym: That is some sort of booming Analog hole thing.

256
00:19:06,588 --> 00:19:12,013
Scott: we should just turn on the echo effect and say analog hole analog hole.

257
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:15,471
Rym: Yeah Alright, I think that's what we'll do.

258
00:19:15,512 --> 00:19:16,397
Rym: We'll get someone who can sing.

259
00:19:17,381 --> 00:19:24,960
Scott: Yep, the point is now is that maybe if Microsoft doesn't patch this is it now smart to sign up for like the new?

260
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,820
Scott: Napster and get a crap ton of music that is not DRM.

261
00:19:30,042 --> 00:19:30,565
Rym: You know what?

262
00:19:31,168 --> 00:19:33,300
Rym: Most of the music I like isn't on Napster anyway.

263
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,344
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

264
00:19:34,384 --> 00:19:37,816
Scott: But for other people who are into the current music, you know,

265
00:19:38,398 --> 00:19:58,238
Rym: maybe I mean I guess my opinion is that I mean early on I hated the RIA and you know Bastards and I'd always fight it and I fired everything and I realized that the vast majority of the music I was pirating had almost nothing to do with any of this because most of the music I like is either foreign old or Obscure.

266
00:19:59,121 --> 00:20:06,655
Scott: Yeah, I mean all the old music that was RAA I got in the Napster days and the win Mx days and now there really isn't.

267
00:20:06,796 --> 00:20:10,827
Rym: you know, you can't make what we've got Every little we've got every Rolling Stones.

268
00:20:10,867 --> 00:20:13,233
Scott: No one's making more old music.

269
00:20:13,454 --> 00:20:14,777
Scott: It's already existing.

270
00:20:14,818 --> 00:20:15,580
Scott: That's why it's old.

271
00:20:16,141 --> 00:20:17,968
Scott: I've already got all of it that I want.

272
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,737
Scott: if I want more I can go and get like.

273
00:20:20,838 --> 00:20:31,720
Scott: I can go buy UCDs rip them and get them back to the UCD store or I can go to my dad's, you know Take a you know, his turndable and a vinyl record and take them off with the analog hole.

274
00:20:32,949 --> 00:20:37,853
Scott: but You know the new music I don't care about but some people do.

275
00:20:38,275 --> 00:20:39,960
Rym: and thus well, I care about new music.

276
00:20:40,121 --> 00:20:42,190
Rym: I don't care about top 40s new music.

277
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:42,551
Scott: Yeah.

278
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:44,399
Scott: Yeah, that's what I mean by new.

279
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,408
Scott: I mean, I gotta say music in the u.s.

280
00:20:46,749 --> 00:20:50,143
Rym: Total aside, but I have fallen in love with the cat Empire All right.

281
00:20:50,706 --> 00:20:52,574
Scott: I don't care so much for the cat Empire.

282
00:20:52,634 --> 00:20:52,815
Scott: Yeah.

283
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:59,320
Rym: Well, you don't like ska Kinda you don't even like any of the sky I've played except for like that one song from snatch.

284
00:20:59,722 --> 00:21:01,330
Scott: There's a few skies.

285
00:21:01,351 --> 00:21:04,848
Rym: this town is looking like a ghost town Whatever.

286
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:07,947
Scott: Okay So that's that's the news.

287
00:21:08,148 --> 00:21:09,532
Scott: That's the kind of an old news.

288
00:21:09,672 --> 00:21:09,953
Scott: Actually.

289
00:21:10,013 --> 00:21:12,400
Scott: It's like from a while ago, but from that long ago.

290
00:21:12,581 --> 00:21:13,589
Scott: It's like August 25th.

291
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,603
Rym: Oh Whatever.

292
00:21:15,663 --> 00:21:16,688
Rym: What day is today sky?

293
00:21:16,748 --> 00:21:17,591
Scott: It was three days ago.

294
00:21:17,933 --> 00:21:18,555
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

295
00:21:18,635 --> 00:21:19,740
Rym: When was the last time we did a show?

296
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:29,718
Rym: Uh Yeah, we pretty much broke this news as soon as we could without doing a GeekNights on the scheduled news bulletin Which we've never had cause to do yet.

297
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:38,819
Rym: Yep, rest assured though if something crazy ever happens There's gonna be a GeekNights about it right away unless we're dead or we're there or we caused it.

298
00:21:47,624 --> 00:21:48,577
Rym: Things of the day.

299
00:21:48,881 --> 00:22:01,186
Rym: All right This one's a bit old but I don't think a lot of people out there have seen it and I think it's pretty cool partly Because I did something similar though on a much lower scale than this, dude Now I'm sure.

300
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:04,979
Rym: well, I hope because I realized that a lot of our listeners are younger than us.

301
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:12,420
Rym: There was this golden age of nerf when we were kids because when I was young the nerf bow and arrow debuted.

302
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,629
Rym: It was a one-of-a-kind toy.

303
00:22:15,271 --> 00:22:19,150
Rym: It was the first toy like that and It was amazing.

304
00:22:19,211 --> 00:22:20,040
Rym: It sold out immediately.

305
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:26,958
Rym: There was crazy runs on it like there were for Cabbage Patch Dolls back in the day and I don't know tickle me elbows and all that crap.

306
00:22:28,081 --> 00:22:30,408
Rym: In fact, it was so bad that on Christmas.

307
00:22:30,448 --> 00:22:33,396
Rym: My brother got one, but there weren't anymore.

308
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,640
Rym: So I didn't get one.

309
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:39,860
Rym: I got this knockoff Robin Hood bow and arrow with terrible foam arrows that barely worked.

310
00:22:40,482 --> 00:22:45,720
Scott: See we had very little nerve stuff, you know, because at first my parents were like apprehensive.

311
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:50,305
Scott: They were like, I don't know if we're gonna get you nerve what but then you know Eventually, we got some.

312
00:22:50,345 --> 00:22:52,315
Scott: we just didn't get a giant arsenal.

313
00:22:52,476 --> 00:22:54,453
Scott: nerf was no one I knew actually had an entire.

314
00:22:55,683 --> 00:22:59,519
Scott: Most people just had like a bow and arrow and a ball Zuka and that was it where I grew up.

315
00:23:00,021 --> 00:23:01,846
Rym: Everyone had an arsenal of nerf.

316
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:04,955
Rym: nerf was such a pivotal part of my childhood.

317
00:23:04,975 --> 00:23:16,260
Rym: In fact, I would say nerf Nintendo slash Atari, uh old like Hitchcock Vincent Price movies and Damn Dungeons & Dragons pretty much define my childhood.

318
00:23:17,942 --> 00:23:23,859
Rym: And I had like every good nerf thing because nerf started out great and all the original nerfs were awesome awesome awesome.

319
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:40,970
Rym: and Then they fell to super soaker syndrome because the I'd say that the some of the original super super soakers Much like the original nerf were far superior to the products that came out later and they kept discontinuing good products and then releasing Crappy breakable big pieces of plastic products.

320
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:43,700
Scott: Yeah nerf did over time decrease in quality.

321
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:47,698
Scott: The early nerf stuff was light on the plastic and was very functional.

322
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:50,002
Scott: later There was a lot of flair Like.

323
00:23:50,042 --> 00:23:55,771
Scott: I remember that we had a nerf gun with like a LED sight that would kind of work like a laser But it was.

324
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:56,237
Rym: I don't get it.

325
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:01,719
Rym: The nerf bow and arrow was a fantastic toy and I never understood why they discontinued it and why they made just crap.

326
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:01,940
Rym: nerf.

327
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,749
Rym: Yeah, they're disappeared nowadays.

328
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:06,240
Scott: They still have nerf but barely Yeah.

329
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:13,840
Rym: and when I was a kid like we would have wars where Everyone was art like I have a nerf bow and arrow on my back and I'd have to like single shot pistols.

330
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:16,570
Scott: It was all about the at six shooter of arrows.

331
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,195
Scott: It had six big arrows.

332
00:24:18,235 --> 00:24:19,319
Scott: anyone doo doo doo doo doo.

333
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:24,399
Rym: Yes, that was in fact the best nerf gun and that was like the m16 of nerf.

334
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,560
Scott: It fired six arrows and all you did was pull the trigger six times.

335
00:24:27,643 --> 00:24:32,292
Rym: Oh, no, no No That one is crap compared to the original incarnation of that where it was a pump.

336
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:37,680
Rym: you basically pulled it back and then it fired And then you pushed it forward and it rotated the Gatling gun mechanism.

337
00:24:38,163 --> 00:24:39,453
Scott: Yeah, that's the what the Gatling good.

338
00:24:39,493 --> 00:24:41,062
Rym: It didn't have a trigger I thought you.

339
00:24:41,143 --> 00:24:42,567
Scott: you pumped it and then you pulled it.

340
00:24:42,608 --> 00:24:42,768
Scott: No.

341
00:24:42,788 --> 00:24:43,751
Rym: No, you didn't pull the trigger.

342
00:24:44,253 --> 00:24:46,180
Rym: Anyway, I know my nerf.

343
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,323
Scott: Yeah, I didn't have it.

344
00:24:47,364 --> 00:24:49,270
Rym: So it was called the nerf arrow store.

345
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,033
Scott: That was the one.

346
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,240
Rym: it was the best nerf gun ever made.

347
00:24:52,361 --> 00:24:53,570
Scott: Yeah, that's the one now.

348
00:24:53,691 --> 00:25:00,900
Rym: Anyway, I Somewhat modified my arrow storm because later this thing I think was called a razorback came out and it was actually.

349
00:25:01,342 --> 00:25:05,440
Rym: That was the beginning of the end of nerf because that was the first bad nerf product.

350
00:25:06,601 --> 00:25:07,866
Rym: It was a Gatling gun.

351
00:25:08,528 --> 00:25:09,974
Rym: that well, it wasn't really a Gatling gun.

352
00:25:09,994 --> 00:25:12,145
Rym: It was a chain fed machine gun How's that?

353
00:25:12,165 --> 00:25:13,840
Rym: and it had this plastic chain?

354
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:20,841
Rym: you loaded it with these orange suction darts and you cranked it and it just spat out arrows like bit a bit a bit a bit a bit a bit a bit a bit a bit a bit a Problem.

355
00:25:20,861 --> 00:25:22,346
Rym: was it jammed like a motherfucker.

356
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:23,551
Rym: It barely worked.

357
00:25:23,571 --> 00:25:26,220
Rym: It didn't shoot very hard or very far and the chain would just break.

358
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:35,539
Rym: but the arrows I noticed fit inside of the Launchers for the arrow storm because normally you would put a big yellow arrow over the arrow storm.

359
00:25:36,242 --> 00:25:39,618
Rym: Instead I'd shove these tiny little orange arrows into the launcher.

360
00:25:40,642 --> 00:25:44,479
Scott: Yeah, so it used to be an arrow with a hole in it and you would stick a little.

361
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:48,420
Scott: you know A blower of air would blow air into the arrow.

362
00:25:48,962 --> 00:25:52,879
Scott: Now you're stuffing that blower with an arrow in it.

363
00:25:53,201 --> 00:26:05,975
Rym: I also opened the thing and put a bigger spring in it Now when I would shoot it at people because the people come into my basement and I'd be like check out my nerf gun and they'd always say that doesn't look like and then I'd shoot him with it.

364
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:15,344
Rym: and As far as I can gather because I was never personally shot with my own gun, but apparently it hurt a lot And it was fantastic Awesome.

365
00:26:15,585 --> 00:26:18,760
Rym: Now this guy did something times a million to get back on track.

366
00:26:19,041 --> 00:26:21,992
Rym: He made a bonafide nerf sniper rifle.

367
00:26:22,494 --> 00:26:23,096
Scott: Holy crap.

368
00:26:23,116 --> 00:26:24,080
Rym: You have to see this thing.

369
00:26:24,181 --> 00:26:25,463
Rym: This is a sniper rifle.

370
00:26:27,122 --> 00:26:29,780
Scott: It's quite large and quite high quality.

371
00:26:30,141 --> 00:26:33,731
Scott: Like usually you see someone make a mod and it's slightly shoddy.

372
00:26:34,032 --> 00:26:35,776
Scott: This thing is polished.

373
00:26:36,197 --> 00:26:37,140
Rym: It looks really good.

374
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,660
Rym: The guy doesn't look like a super nerd and the thing looks like it really really hurts.

375
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:46,454
Scott: Yeah, and you can tell by the way he loads the arrow bolt into it how quality it is.

376
00:26:46,655 --> 00:26:48,059
Rym: Yeah, so check this video out.

377
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:49,422
Rym: Hmm.

378
00:26:49,884 --> 00:26:50,065
Rym: All right.

379
00:26:50,085 --> 00:26:50,486
Rym: What do you got?

380
00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:59,686
Scott: Okay, so this isn't really the greatest thing of the day but it's it's a good example of Linux Discrimination if you will.

381
00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:01,796
Rym: Ah, you're doing my classic.

382
00:27:01,896 --> 00:27:02,700
Rym: I don't have a thing of the day.

383
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:06,674
Rym: I'll take a news and just kind of jam it into the thing of the day spot sort of.

384
00:27:06,735 --> 00:27:15,816
Scott: it's not really a news so much Yeah, anyway at New York Times com the website of the New York Times.

385
00:27:15,937 --> 00:27:21,720
Scott: they have some videos and Some of these videos are in different sections on the site.

386
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,472
Scott: Now these videos play with the flash player.

387
00:27:25,552 --> 00:27:27,380
Scott: It's it's sort of like YouTube, you know.

388
00:27:27,721 --> 00:27:33,699
Scott: It's it's flash video with a slightly different piece of you know, not the same as YouTube, but it's the same thing.

389
00:27:34,967 --> 00:27:41,148
Scott: anyway If you want to watch a video on the front page It just shows up and you click play and you watch it.

390
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:52,920
Scott: It works fine in every web browser and every operating system as long as you have a New enough version of flash that supports flash video and it doesn't matter if you're using Firefox or IE or whatever.

391
00:27:54,646 --> 00:28:05,768
Scott: however For some reason on Linux if you decide to go to the video section of the New York Times website it It won't work.

392
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:11,024
Scott: It won't actually let you go there even if you know You have.

393
00:28:11,044 --> 00:28:15,740
Scott: you know, obviously your computer can play the video because it's playing the video on the front page.

394
00:28:16,502 --> 00:28:22,660
Scott: But if you go to the video page where there are more videos, it won't let you go there now, uh, it gets better.

395
00:28:24,191 --> 00:28:24,498
Scott: It does.

396
00:28:25,281 --> 00:28:29,620
Rym: Yeah, because you realize it only looks at the user agent string and if you change that it works just fine in Linux?

397
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:30,775
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

398
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:42,180
Rym: So there's absolutely no reason for it to not work in Linux except that all they do is they check to see if you're using Linux and if you are they make it break on purpose.

399
00:28:42,963 --> 00:28:45,153
Scott: Yeah, well it's it's not if you're using Linux.

400
00:28:45,213 --> 00:28:46,760
Scott: it doesn't say if Linux don't work.

401
00:28:47,141 --> 00:28:59,096
Scott: It says if you're not using Internet Explorer if you don't have a new enough flash And if you're you know, not using Netscape 6.2 or higher then don't let them view this page.

402
00:28:59,116 --> 00:29:00,439
Scott: show them this error message instead.

403
00:29:00,499 --> 00:29:02,693
Scott: now For me, I just tried it.

404
00:29:02,714 --> 00:29:03,340
Scott: It just worked.

405
00:29:03,481 --> 00:29:09,300
Scott: I don't know if they change something or if my user agent is lying or well This is all you with the new with this thing.

406
00:29:09,743 --> 00:29:12,219
Rym: If you got some bad reporting and it's not true it's not it.

407
00:29:13,683 --> 00:29:16,120
Scott: If it's not true anymore, then it's changed very recently.

408
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:32,100
Scott: The point is Rob limo an old slashdot guy made a video on his computer of him You know falling into this trap on Linux and you can watch this video Which is the thing of the day the video itself where he shows the blatant discrimination by the New York Times against Linux.

409
00:29:33,261 --> 00:29:39,120
Scott: So it's like, you know, it's bad enough that a lot of people don't make things for Linux, you know, or whatever.

410
00:29:40,062 --> 00:29:46,820
Scott: But someone to make a website that Linux would normally work just fine on but they purposefully filter you out.

411
00:29:46,981 --> 00:29:54,813
Scott: It's like uh, all I got to say is that no website Anywhere ever any more Ellie in the past.

412
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:56,720
Scott: It was okay to do this, but not anymore.

413
00:29:57,141 --> 00:30:07,600
Scott: You should never check to see what you know operating system and browser Your visitors are using and then decide not to let them see your content.

414
00:30:07,801 --> 00:30:09,305
Rym: You should just you could warn them.

415
00:30:09,666 --> 00:30:12,213
Rym: Hey, I suck and the site might not work with you.

416
00:30:12,233 --> 00:30:12,795
Rym: Yep.

417
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:28,917
Scott: You can also, you know Change the content differently like let's say, you know If someone has IE then you want to use this CSS and if they're using Firefox you want to use this CSS because it'll make the page look correct because the browsers do CSS differently.

418
00:30:28,998 --> 00:30:38,480
Scott: That's fine But you should never block anyone From seeing your site based on the browser or else you're an ass because that's not necessary anymore.

419
00:30:39,102 --> 00:30:50,460
Scott: they might have a browser that will be able to render your content just fine and You're gonna prevent them from seeing it because you're not sure if it will work or because you don't know about their obscure browser.

420
00:30:50,903 --> 00:30:52,839
Scott: Screw you screw you with a hose.

421
00:30:54,163 --> 00:30:58,046
Scott: so this video demonstrates Exactly this principle in action.

422
00:30:58,948 --> 00:30:59,449
Rym: and so on.

423
00:30:59,469 --> 00:31:02,237
Rym: to the actual main bit today something we kind of spoke.

424
00:31:02,337 --> 00:31:03,440
Rym: Scott said we talked about it.

425
00:31:03,642 --> 00:31:05,518
Rym: I didn't say anything, but it's something we could do.

426
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:12,500
Scott: Yeah It's easy and it's informative and a lot of people seem to not quite grasp this concept that I thought was common knowledge.

427
00:31:12,832 --> 00:31:15,450
Rym: Yes Now we're going to talk today about bit torrents

428
00:31:15,852 --> 00:31:17,699
Scott: something you should already have known about

429
00:31:18,261 --> 00:31:22,474
Rym: Partly because there are a lot of misconceptions as to what bit torrent is and who it benefits

430
00:31:22,835 --> 00:31:29,175
Scott: and what it's for and how it Even though all of this is widely publicized and talked about.

431
00:31:29,395 --> 00:31:32,426
Rym: so first I guess a bit of history Okay.

432
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:54,114
Scott: Well back in the day occasionally, there would be a very popular file that people would want to download like perhaps the latest update to counter-strike or a large ISO to a new version of a Linux distribution or a Final Fantasy 5 translated ROM That's a personal story.

433
00:31:54,235 --> 00:31:58,319
Scott: I got boned Anyway, or a new anime fan sub.

434
00:31:59,521 --> 00:32:00,664
Scott: Now the solutions.

435
00:32:01,105 --> 00:32:13,123
Scott: in the past this would cause a problem because if a lot of people all wanted the same file at the same Time you needed a gigantic computer to be able to serve it to all of those people Gigantic.

436
00:32:13,905 --> 00:32:18,960
Scott: now sometimes you could set up some mirrors and people would you know disperse themselves among the mirrors?

437
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:19,948
Scott: However, they wanted.

438
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:28,300
Scott: but this is bad, too Because now everyone has to go to all these mirrors and some people hit all the mirrors because you can't stop them from doing that You know.

439
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:36,754
Rym: So that didn't work out either and there was also the issue that it's not like these files would be Downloaded like this all the time and you needed this horsepower all the time.

440
00:32:37,216 --> 00:32:38,682
Rym: It would be a swarm You know.

441
00:32:38,782 --> 00:32:44,922
Rym: a million people try to download the file over the course of a week and then five people try to download it a Month later.

442
00:32:45,043 --> 00:32:48,760
Scott: Yeah, so it's like you buy a gigantic computer to serve one file and then nothing.

443
00:32:49,522 --> 00:32:55,020
Scott: I mean sure someone could start a business where they have giant computers that they rent out, but that's not ideal either.

444
00:32:55,923 --> 00:32:58,552
Scott: You know, there are other people set up systems of cues.

445
00:32:58,673 --> 00:33:00,640
Scott: read wait in line and then get the file.

446
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,685
Rym: That's just piss people off.

447
00:33:01,725 --> 00:33:08,240
Rym: Yeah with things like hotline or different IRC f-serve File planet pretty much only exists because of this problem.

448
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,451
Scott: Yeah, but they came up with file planet which used to be.

449
00:33:11,471 --> 00:33:14,140
Scott: you just go to file planet and get video game files.

450
00:33:14,262 --> 00:33:15,157
Scott: That's how it used to be.

451
00:33:15,863 --> 00:33:21,253
Scott: Now if you want to go to file planet and you don't want to pay money You have to wait in line to get a file.

452
00:33:21,434 --> 00:33:25,000
Scott: if you want to pay money You can just get the file right away because barely anyone pays money.

453
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,402
Rym: You know what.

454
00:33:25,482 --> 00:33:27,652
Rym: don't go to file planet never go to file planet.

455
00:33:27,692 --> 00:33:30,551
Scott: unless there's absolutely nowhere else you can get the file you want.

456
00:33:30,652 --> 00:33:34,358
Scott: and if you Really really really need it and can't get it anywhere else.

457
00:33:35,622 --> 00:33:36,386
Rym: So what to do?

458
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,620
Scott: Yes what to do about this problem?

459
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:50,100
Scott: if only there was some way that you know, we could all get a file at the same time and Without having anyone need a gigantic server and a gigantic bandwidth bill.

460
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:59,691
Rym: now this is where BitTorrent comes in because essentially in a very high level what it does is if One person wants to download a file.

461
00:34:00,274 --> 00:34:01,219
Rym: They get it from the server.

462
00:34:02,303 --> 00:34:07,559
Rym: If two people want to download the file, they both get different parts from the server, then they share those parts.

463
00:34:08,027 --> 00:34:08,233
Scott: Mm-hmm.

464
00:34:08,661 --> 00:34:14,201
Rym: If a hundred people want to get a file from a server a hundred people are all getting different parts and sharing them with each Other.

465
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:25,659
Rym: so the server is effectively in this high-level somewhat optimal theoretical situation Only giving the file out once and then it's being shared by everyone else in a swarm.

466
00:34:26,161 --> 00:34:32,280
Rym: Yeah, more people download the faster it gets and the server no matter how many people are downloading it sees almost no traffic.

467
00:34:32,824 --> 00:34:34,279
Scott: Yeah, let's be a little more specific.

468
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,445
Scott: Let's say you have a file.

469
00:34:36,485 --> 00:34:38,532
Scott: That's a hundred megabytes right now.

470
00:34:38,612 --> 00:34:40,719
Scott: You need to give it to a whole mess of people.

471
00:34:41,581 --> 00:34:47,060
Scott: What you do is you break it into smaller bits, let's say each of them is one megabyte and there's a hundred of them.

472
00:34:47,161 --> 00:34:48,248
Scott: I'm just making up numbers.

473
00:34:48,268 --> 00:34:52,899
Scott: They're probably much smaller and You need to give this to a thousand people.

474
00:34:53,241 --> 00:34:57,279
Scott: Well first you give one packet, you know one megabyte to one guy.

475
00:34:58,022 --> 00:35:02,340
Scott: Then you give a different piece to a different guy and a different piece to a different guy.

476
00:35:02,843 --> 00:35:04,880
Scott: Then they share the bits among themselves.

477
00:35:05,101 --> 00:35:09,439
Scott: So everyone is out there saying I need this bit and then someone gives them that bit.

478
00:35:09,761 --> 00:35:11,066
Rym: So I have one in three.

479
00:35:11,166 --> 00:35:12,191
Rym: Scott has two and four.

480
00:35:12,673 --> 00:35:17,673
Rym: I give him the ones he needs and he gives me the ones I need and eventually everyone has all the ones they need.

481
00:35:17,733 --> 00:35:19,480
Scott: but they don't all get them from the server.

482
00:35:19,922 --> 00:35:21,790
Scott: They don't all get them from one person.

483
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:24,060
Scott: They all get them from different people over time.

484
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:33,008
Scott: So, of course the actual download speed is going to be slower because you're losing time Trying to figure out who to get the next bit from.

485
00:35:33,068 --> 00:35:36,740
Scott: you're getting different bits from different people who transfer the bits at different speeds.

486
00:35:37,383 --> 00:35:39,495
Scott: You know, it's not good at the same time.

487
00:35:39,535 --> 00:35:39,736
Rym: now.

488
00:35:39,757 --> 00:35:45,057
Rym: one You're downloading all these different bits at the same time up to the cap of your bandwidth and their bandwidth.

489
00:35:45,298 --> 00:35:47,988
Rym: Mm-hmm And two there's no waiting.

490
00:35:48,429 --> 00:35:51,420
Scott: Yes, you know, that was the biggest problem was the waiting?

491
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:57,031
Scott: I mean sure back in the day downloading a counter-strike update as soon as you actually started downloading.

492
00:35:57,152 --> 00:36:03,459
Scott: it would be as fast as you and that server could go and it Would go to done because it would just send you the whole file in a straight shot.

493
00:36:04,142 --> 00:36:11,144
Scott: But you had to wait so long and you had to keep clicking on different mirrors until you found a link that worked and it Was just a pain in the ass.

494
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:22,018
Scott: with bit torrent you click once and you wait and you leave, you know You don't have to sit there doing things You just get up and leave you come back and it will eventually be there and it's all happy.

495
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,929
Scott: Okay, let's talk a little bit about Where bit torrent came from?

496
00:36:28,371 --> 00:36:28,692
Rym: All right.

497
00:36:28,733 --> 00:36:30,079
Rym: Well, you're the one who looked all that up.

498
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:31,860
Rym: Yes, I didn't remember who made bit torrent.

499
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:39,656
Scott: I used to know his name because it used to Bram Cohen like I thought yeah there's a guy named Bram Cohen and he worked for a company called mojo nation.

500
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:55,120
Scott: that was Basically, they were making a system that allowed people to break up files into little bits and encrypt them and then Distribute those encrypted bits over computers running them, you know mojo nation software.

501
00:36:56,321 --> 00:37:01,840
Scott: So it was sort of like this security thing where files got broken into bits and then sent in bits.

502
00:37:02,244 --> 00:37:06,440
Scott: You know like, you know different chunks That were encrypted for security.

503
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:12,466
Scott: So that way no one could spy on your file because they only had a small portion of it Which is useless, you know.

504
00:37:12,506 --> 00:37:18,156
Scott: and those small portions would all go to different places on the internet and eventually You know end up where they were supposed to be.

505
00:37:19,421 --> 00:37:27,739
Scott: He left that company and made bit torrent which does you know breaks things into bits to share them instead of you know encrypting them all secret like.

506
00:37:28,921 --> 00:37:30,285
Scott: And we have bit torrent today.

507
00:37:30,907 --> 00:37:36,023
Scott: now today bit torrent is like an actual company that does things Instead of just.

508
00:37:36,405 --> 00:37:39,960
Scott: it used to be one guy asking for donations and getting a lot of publicity.

509
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:45,880
Scott: Now it's a whole company with businessmen and all sorts of fanciness and that's a good thing.

510
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:48,794
Scott: I say it's I mean the guy Bram Cohen's still the CEO.

511
00:37:48,814 --> 00:37:52,278
Scott: So The key invented it pretty much all on his own.

512
00:37:53,183 --> 00:37:57,220
Rym: Now I've noticed a lot of people lately partly in our forums and partly on the internet.

513
00:37:57,621 --> 00:38:02,980
Rym: They'll complain about bit torrent in that they'll say things like oh, I want to download this anime.

514
00:38:03,141 --> 00:38:07,220
Rym: That was on anime Sookie a month ago, but there's no seeds and it's downloading really slowly.

515
00:38:07,301 --> 00:38:09,098
Rym: I thought bit torrent was supposed to make this fast.

516
00:38:09,782 --> 00:38:12,213
Scott: Yeah, bit torrent wasn't supposed to make it fast.

517
00:38:12,253 --> 00:38:18,500
Rym: It was supposed to make the files available And basically it's faster the more people are downloading it.

518
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:32,655
Rym: so if something's not popular anymore it's going to be at best as fast as that server could have served it on his own and probably broken because For various reasons mostly involving copyright law torrents tend to be very ephemeral.

519
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,440
Rym: They come and go and then they're gone.

520
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:48,359
Scott: Yeah, something you have to understand about bit torrent is The cedars and leechers and back in the day leecher meant you know someone who downloaded a whole bunch and never uploaded anything on a network like Napster or something.

521
00:38:48,379 --> 00:38:58,470
Scott: and You know leecher and bit torrent doesn't mean exactly the same thing, but it's pretty close in in its meaning except It's not really a bad thing because it's just how it works.

522
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,780
Rym: I mean a lot of people can't really serve so much.

523
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:07,166
Scott: Yeah, leecher used to be a bad saying like hey, you're downloading a whole bunch of stuff off Napster But you're not sharing anything.

524
00:39:07,186 --> 00:39:09,578
Scott: you've got, you know, and that wasn't cool.

525
00:39:10,321 --> 00:39:15,014
Scott: But nowadays leecher me in bit torrent when you're downloading something.

526
00:39:15,075 --> 00:39:17,000
Scott: You're also uploading at the same time.

527
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,484
Scott: So a leecher isn't a total leecher.

528
00:39:20,225 --> 00:39:21,807
Scott: There's also a cedar.

529
00:39:21,828 --> 00:39:26,789
Scott: a cedar is Someone who's already downloaded the entire file.

530
00:39:27,372 --> 00:39:35,450
Scott: but they are continuing to send chunks out to people who need those chunks and that More cedars that you can find on a torrent the faster it will go.

531
00:39:35,611 --> 00:39:39,614
Scott: So leechers help a bit because you know They're uploading and downloading.

532
00:39:39,975 --> 00:39:45,090
Scott: but cedars help a whole lot because you can ask a cedar and you know, he'll have whatever chunk you need.

533
00:39:46,211 --> 00:39:50,364
Scott: So the more cedars and the more leechers out there the faster the torrents gonna be.

534
00:39:50,484 --> 00:39:51,929
Scott: but that's not the only factor.

535
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:55,168
Scott: a lot of People still complain, you know that a torrent isn't working.

536
00:39:55,208 --> 00:39:58,350
Scott: Well Even when there are a whole bunch of cedars and leechers.

537
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,894
Scott: Well, it could.

538
00:39:59,954 --> 00:40:12,383
Scott: a torrent could work really well when there's only one cedar in leecher if that cedar is your next-door neighbor Because you're gonna be able to get all the chunks from him right away and you won't need to worry about anyone else in the Whole world, you know.

539
00:40:13,531 --> 00:40:22,428
Scott: But you know, there could be a hundred cedars on the other side of the world Which means it's gonna be slow because no matter who you're getting the chunks from they're on the other side of the world.

540
00:40:22,729 --> 00:40:28,770
Rym: or there Could be one cedar who's well, he's seeding for you and he's really really fast, but he only has half the file.

541
00:40:29,212 --> 00:40:31,543
Rym: Yeah, and the rest of the file is all coming.

542
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,969
Rym: Everyone is getting the file from the.

543
00:40:32,989 --> 00:40:34,617
Scott: well He's only got half the file.

544
00:40:34,637 --> 00:40:35,280
Scott: He's not a cedar.

545
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:35,902
Scott: He's still leecher.

546
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:36,766
Rym: Oh, yeah, but he's all.

547
00:40:36,786 --> 00:40:45,210
Scott: you can also be serving Yep, and you know and the thing is is when someone makes a new bit torrent what they do is they take a file That's already completed.

548
00:40:46,151 --> 00:40:48,510
Scott: They then create a torrent file.

549
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:55,166
Scott: Then that torrent file is a small tiny file that anyone could download in like a second from a website.

550
00:40:55,246 --> 00:41:09,410
Scott: if they're so small and insignificant I think if you're on dial-up, it would take you less than a minute to download a torrent file and You give that torrent file to your torrent client and that tells the torrent client how to start how to find the tracker and how?

551
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:14,350
Scott: To get those chunks of the file and you know who's seeding it and who's leeching it and all that stuff.

552
00:41:14,852 --> 00:41:17,201
Rym: We could go into more detail, but you probably don't care.

553
00:41:17,301 --> 00:41:18,144
Rym: if you guys really care.

554
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:18,606
Rym: Let us know.

555
00:41:18,646 --> 00:41:19,550
Rym: We'll do another episode.

556
00:41:20,292 --> 00:41:24,969
Scott: Yeah, pretty much what it is is the tracker tells you where the other bit torrent are.

557
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:32,010
Scott: Torrent errors are for the file and then you know, the torrent file tells you what the file looks like.

558
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:44,668
Scott: That's why when you start a new bit torrent the file appears right away because the bit torrent file tells you how big the file is and what its name is and all that good stuff and Then it just fills the file with data as it does its torrent thing.

559
00:41:44,688 --> 00:41:52,488
Rym: now There are also ways to do like trackerless torrents, which basically it doesn't mean trackerless Actually, it means that everyone is a tracker basically.

560
00:41:52,608 --> 00:42:02,990
Rym: Yep Yep and the the only thing you need to know is that there are two ways to go about this the Normal way that every bit torrent client in the world except one uses and then the azure is way.

561
00:42:04,691 --> 00:42:09,810
Scott: Yeah, the way that every other bit torrent client in the world uses is the one that is recommended.

562
00:42:09,912 --> 00:42:10,422
Rym: What DH?

563
00:42:12,151 --> 00:42:14,879
Scott: DHT is developed by the bit torrent company.

564
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,129
Scott: So it's the official way and that's the way you probably want to do it.

565
00:42:18,752 --> 00:42:20,398
Rym: Yeah, because if you do it the azure is way.

566
00:42:20,438 --> 00:42:22,827
Rym: you can only take advantage of this with other.

567
00:42:22,887 --> 00:42:23,730
Rym: azure is users.

568
00:42:23,879 --> 00:42:28,385
Scott: Yep Now a lot of people get confused and they think a tracker is the same thing as like a listing.

569
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,553
Scott: a listing is not the same Thing as a tracker.

570
00:42:31,155 --> 00:42:35,470
Scott: all the tracker does is it tells you where the other people are torrenting?

571
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:39,050
Scott: You never look at a tracker only the bit torrent client talks to the tracker.

572
00:42:39,131 --> 00:42:40,763
Scott: it's not something you see with your eyeballs.

573
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:58,758
Scott: generally a Listing is a place where you get torrent files and torrent files are listed and those are like, you know websites like, you know mini Nova and torrent spy and torrent box torrent reactor torrent reactor and The the ill-fated Loki torrents.

574
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,282
Rym: I remember Loki torrents.

575
00:43:00,422 --> 00:43:01,926
Scott: Yep, then they got hosed by course.

576
00:43:01,986 --> 00:43:02,327
Rym: Luckily.

577
00:43:02,367 --> 00:43:03,410
Rym: We have the Pirates Bay.

578
00:43:04,172 --> 00:43:05,996
Rym: The Pirates Bay will never die.

579
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:08,944
Scott: the king of torrent tracker not torrent listings.

580
00:43:09,064 --> 00:43:10,989
Scott: Yes, not track the pirate listing.

581
00:43:11,229 --> 00:43:12,890
Rym: Yes exactly.

582
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:19,898
Rym: Anyway now in terms of actually using bit torrent I assume all of you out there can do it.

583
00:43:19,918 --> 00:43:27,743
Rym: you download a bit torrent client now and get the Bit torrent client if you want, there are also a million other bit torrent clients.

584
00:43:27,923 --> 00:43:29,990
Scott: I prefer the bit torrent client.

585
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:33,489
Scott: However, you can also get a serious which is a big Java thing.

586
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:36,259
Rym: Yep, a serious is really really simple to use.

587
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,082
Scott: you can get.

588
00:43:37,102 --> 00:43:41,230
Scott: a very popular one is micro torrent Which is not actually micro torrent.

589
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:48,336
Scott: It's like, you know mu the little micro Greek letter and that's the word torrent that you with the long thingy coming off the left Side.

590
00:43:48,377 --> 00:43:52,689
Rym: Yeah Scott why did the cat fall off the slanted roof?

591
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:55,418
Scott: Why did the cat fall off?

592
00:43:55,458 --> 00:43:57,249
Rym: because it lost its mu?

593
00:43:58,391 --> 00:43:59,554
Scott: Don't do.

594
00:43:59,674 --> 00:44:01,639
Rym: mu is the coefficient of friction.

595
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,522
Scott: Yes, it is.

596
00:44:03,404 --> 00:44:04,728
Rym: I made a physics joke.

597
00:44:05,008 --> 00:44:09,560
Scott: Oh, no Yeah, that's a very popular one.

598
00:44:10,102 --> 00:44:14,800
Scott: that is a very popular joke a Very popular, but I'm torrent client.

599
00:44:15,503 --> 00:44:16,729
Rym: I should be all Groucho Marx.

600
00:44:17,392 --> 00:44:24,570
Scott: There are other bit torrent clients out there and you can use any one of them, you know And they'll probably all work just fine.

601
00:44:25,252 --> 00:44:35,713
Rym: Now one last bit about using bit torrent clients is that and where we're gonna do a whole show on this because no one Out there seems to understand it unless you know They're technologists.

602
00:44:36,234 --> 00:44:44,097
Rym: and yet it's something that you all should really know about because almost everyone accesses the internet through a net now a router That basically gives you different IP addresses.

603
00:44:44,819 --> 00:44:48,049
Rym: if you don't know what that means don't worry about it, but you probably have it anyway.

604
00:44:49,034 --> 00:44:51,590
Rym: The thing is there's something called port forwarding.

605
00:44:53,011 --> 00:45:00,190
Rym: To not go into any technical detail, even though I will someday I will go into excruciatingly boring technical detail if you want.

606
00:45:01,192 --> 00:45:28,910
Rym: but you need to forward ports TCP ports on your router to whatever computer or computers you want to use bit torrent with and Different bit torrent clients can use different numbers of ports The ray if you're using the normal bit torrent client and you have only one computer that wants to download torrents forward ports six eight eight one through six nine nine nine to the computer that is running bit torrent.

607
00:45:29,091 --> 00:45:31,989
Rym: Assuming that that computer is somewhat secure.

608
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:39,688
Rym: Mm-hmm bit torrent will run just fine If you don't use any of this port forwarding But it'll be a lot faster and better if you do.

609
00:45:40,491 --> 00:45:46,954
Rym: If you use a serious the easiest way to know if you've got this set up or not is if you've ever seen a green Smiley face, you're okay.

610
00:45:47,416 --> 00:45:50,989
Rym: If you've only ever seen yellow, you probably don't have port forwarding set up.

611
00:45:51,772 --> 00:46:16,308
Scott: Another thing to note is that if you have universal plug-and-play UP and P enabled on your router and your OS supports it then most bit torrent clients Especially the default one take advantage of that and will be able to get you the green smiley faces by telling the router to open the ports, however You P&P is not the most secure thing in the world so turn it on with much hesitation.

612
00:46:16,509 --> 00:46:26,518
Scott: Yes Usually you P&P will cause you problems if someone gets access to your network and then opens up ports to the outside world and then Comes in through those ports.

613
00:46:27,122 --> 00:46:28,409
Scott: That's that's what you got to worry about.

614
00:46:28,845 --> 00:46:28,950
Rym: Yeah.

615
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:33,751
Rym: And of course one nice advantage of a serious if you don't want to really bother with this so much is that you can tell It.

616
00:46:34,193 --> 00:46:38,049
Rym: use this one port for all that crap and then just open that one port.

617
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:43,349
Rym: And in a lot of ways that is probably how the bit torrent client should be.

618
00:46:44,071 --> 00:46:53,305
Rym: But I guess because the bit torrent client is written by someone who's technical and because this solution works just fine for technical people There is no reason to make a single port solution.

619
00:46:53,788 --> 00:46:58,525
Rym: Yeah I am an advocate of single port solutions in most applications as an IT major.

620
00:46:58,545 --> 00:47:01,900
Scott: I Think it's just the way the software is written.

621
00:47:01,921 --> 00:47:03,710
Scott: It's faster and more efficient this way.

622
00:47:03,971 --> 00:47:05,861
Rym: Yeah, I mean you can make arguments both ways.

623
00:47:06,082 --> 00:47:07,127
Rym: He chose to do it this way.

624
00:47:07,147 --> 00:47:09,920
Scott: I'm not gonna argue I think it's mostly because you don't know about coding.

625
00:47:10,181 --> 00:47:13,837
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time to look at the software You don't know about networking so much.

626
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:15,363
Scott: I know about network coding.

627
00:47:15,664 --> 00:47:17,170
Scott: I know how to code network applications.

628
00:47:17,351 --> 00:47:19,300
Rym: I took classes on coding network applications.

629
00:47:19,602 --> 00:47:20,365
Scott: Yeah, me too.

630
00:47:20,566 --> 00:47:20,828
Scott: Yeah.

631
00:47:21,009 --> 00:47:21,230
Scott: Yeah.

632
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:26,870
Rym: Anyway, anyway, that is all you need to know about bit torrent unless you want to know more.

633
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:32,890
Scott: Yeah, if you don't know how to like specifically use bit torrent, I mean, it's so dead simple.

634
00:47:33,031 --> 00:47:35,470
Scott: You can find it on the internet at the bit torrent website.

635
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:45,350
Rym: And if you guys really want to hear a more technical discussion like specifically You know why these ports need to be open or how a tracker works or what like what protocols are used or how does it?

636
00:47:45,691 --> 00:47:48,550
Rym: Know that the pieces you're getting from other people aren't broken.

637
00:47:49,277 --> 00:47:55,050
Rym: We could do a show about that But we found in the past that the shows we did that were overly technical did not go over so well.

638
00:47:55,211 --> 00:47:59,430
Scott: Yeah, people seem to go like hey you talked over my head and I'm like, well, it's tech day.

639
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:05,579
Rym: I figure people who listen on tech day want to talk about you know I think the people who listen on tech day want to learn about tech stuff.

640
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:09,270
Scott: Yeah, they got to understand the over-the-head talk.

641
00:48:11,233 --> 00:48:13,975
Scott: Yeah, all right Bit torrent is awesome.

642
00:48:14,316 --> 00:48:17,005
Scott: You should use it, but it does not replace napster.

643
00:48:17,105 --> 00:48:19,095
Scott: It is not a napster replacement It does.

644
00:48:19,398 --> 00:48:21,373
Scott: it is not a Kazaa replacement It's all.

645
00:48:21,454 --> 00:48:25,090
Scott: it serves a different purpose and solves a different problem and it is awesome.

646
00:48:25,451 --> 00:48:31,730
Rym: In fact, it solves a problem that many of you young kids probably never saw because it was a problem that came and went on.

647
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:36,690
Scott: Yeah, I think that's why a lot of people don't understand it because they never experienced the problems.

648
00:48:37,032 --> 00:48:39,224
Rym: They never experienced the Golden Age of peer-to-peer.

649
00:48:39,727 --> 00:48:40,250
Scott: That is true.

650
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:48,481
Rym: I mean we lived through the dawn birth Rennet of rise Renaissance death Renaissance death Renaissance and death of Napster.

651
00:48:48,823 --> 00:48:49,809
Scott: that is correct.

652
00:48:50,892 --> 00:49:05,530
Rym: there was a time when I would go on to my computer start Napster and Every song in the world that I could ever dream of was available Immediately at insane speed and as far as the world was concerned.

653
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:06,292
Rym: It wasn't illegal.

654
00:49:06,333 --> 00:49:08,620
Rym: the recording industry barely even knew this existed.

655
00:49:08,921 --> 00:49:09,322
Scott: Yep.

656
00:49:09,824 --> 00:49:11,710
Rym: It was just this crazy thing.

657
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:12,930
Rym: No one was getting sued.

658
00:49:13,031 --> 00:49:16,610
Rym: No one even thought of the possibility that you might be sued.

659
00:49:17,051 --> 00:49:20,742
Rym: Most people just assumed it was legal if they even knew anything about copyright law.

660
00:49:20,983 --> 00:49:21,945
Scott: It was good times.

661
00:49:22,367 --> 00:49:23,530
Rym: It was crazy time.

662
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:30,131
Scott: Yeah, oh and one more thing that you know, a lot of people I know complain about bit torrent again thinking it's Napster Cuz.

663
00:49:30,151 --> 00:49:32,063
Scott: they say I can't get individual songs.

664
00:49:32,144 --> 00:49:33,090
Scott: I can only get albums.

665
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:33,593
Scott: Well, it's like.

666
00:49:33,634 --> 00:49:36,030
Scott: first of all, why don't you want the album instead of the original song?

667
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:38,483
Scott: If you're not if you're gonna steal it, why not steal the whole thing?

668
00:49:38,804 --> 00:49:40,894
Scott: steal as much as you can Yeah, the old pack right?

669
00:49:40,914 --> 00:49:41,757
Rym: Where's mentality?

670
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:43,504
Rym: if I can download it, but damn it.

671
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:45,494
Rym: It's worth archiving on my raid Yeah,

672
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:52,971
Scott: and if you just want one song Well if bit torrents the easiest way to get it download the whole album and delete everything but the one song Yeah,

673
00:49:53,232 --> 00:49:56,183
Rym: or if you just want the one song you could use the iTunes store for a dollar

674
00:49:56,544 --> 00:49:58,676
Scott: and of course deal with DRM's And whatnot.

675
00:49:58,757 --> 00:50:01,719
Rym: Yeah, but then you hack the DRM Can't hack the iTunes here.

676
00:50:01,739 --> 00:50:01,981
Scott: I'm right.

677
00:50:02,001 --> 00:50:06,570
Scott: Yeah, you can't analog hole But the way to do it now is to burn a CD and then rip it off the CD.

678
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:10,786
Scott: Yeah, the pseudo Danna log costs one CD and then a dollar.

679
00:50:11,048 --> 00:50:21,410
Scott: But anyway no, but The reason that is is because putting incredibly small files on bit torrent is kind of pointless unless it's an incredibly popular file.

680
00:50:21,712 --> 00:50:25,578
Scott: I mean, yeah, if you have a three megabyte mp3 You can.

681
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:32,607
Scott: nowadays that everyone has Broadband because realistically bit torrent doesn't work if you don't have broadband with dial-up.

682
00:50:32,668 --> 00:50:33,390
Scott: It's basically used.

683
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:33,712
Rym: You know what?

684
00:50:33,752 --> 00:50:36,388
Rym: If you have dial-up one, you're probably not listening to geek.

685
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:38,054
Rym: not though I know we have a few listeners.

686
00:50:38,154 --> 00:50:38,716
Rym: use dialogue.

687
00:50:38,776 --> 00:50:39,438
Rym: Seriously.

688
00:50:39,458 --> 00:50:43,930
Scott: I can't expect anyone to even download mp3s at all.

689
00:50:44,111 --> 00:50:45,138
Scott: I'm dial-up granted.

690
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:46,830
Rym: I downloaded mp3s over time.

691
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:53,232
Scott: That's like someone driving on the highway where the speed limit is 65, but their car can't get over 40.

692
00:50:53,232 --> 00:50:54,760
Scott: It's like you shouldn't be on this highway.

693
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:55,243
Scott: get off.

694
00:50:55,263 --> 00:50:55,605
Scott: You're gonna.

695
00:50:55,665 --> 00:50:56,510
Scott: you're being dangerous.

696
00:50:56,590 --> 00:51:02,597
Rym: I remember when downloading and successfully getting a three megabyte mp3 Was this crazy deal.

697
00:51:02,617 --> 00:51:06,170
Rym: and then you would break it up onto a floppy disk and give it to your friend.

698
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:11,366
Scott: I downloaded open office over 56 K and brown three or four CDs or something.

699
00:51:11,647 --> 00:51:12,630
Rym: I lived in the promised land.

700
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:13,915
Rym: I had a cable modem pretty much.

701
00:51:13,955 --> 00:51:15,522
Scott: I don't remember it was just one CD.

702
00:51:15,582 --> 00:51:17,550
Scott: It was big hundreds of megabytes.

703
00:51:17,691 --> 00:51:19,359
Rym: I had a cable modem pretty much forever.

704
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:29,290
Scott: Yeah, but the point is If you have broadband sending a three megabyte mp3 to like a whole mess of people takes like five seconds each.

705
00:51:29,431 --> 00:51:31,330
Scott: So you don't really need bit torrent for that.

706
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:36,726
Scott: You could just have a FTP server and it wouldn't have a problem doing it even if a thousand people showed up.

707
00:51:37,451 --> 00:51:50,150
Scott: The problem is if you want to have a 500 megabyte or two gigabyte game demo that you have to distribute to people Then it takes so long to do it that bit torrent actually makes things go faster and not slower.

708
00:51:50,451 --> 00:51:58,639
Scott: So that is why people only distribute entire albums and movies and TV shows on bit torrent and not Individual songs because it's pointless.

709
00:51:59,302 --> 00:52:04,199
Rym: Well, hopefully we've dispelled some of the Myths rumors and misunderstandings about bit torrent.

710
00:52:04,641 --> 00:52:09,050
Rym: as always if you want to argue with us or anything You can hit the forums the four.

711
00:52:09,172 --> 00:52:10,070
Scott: Oh also one note.

712
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:18,138
Scott: I keep forgetting to say this if you apply for membership to the forum and you do not receive an email that says Congratulations.

713
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:23,750
Scott: You are a member of the forum Come back to the forum and try to sign in with the name and password you chose.

714
00:52:24,352 --> 00:52:33,730
Scott: there is a hundred percent chance that you were approved and you just didn't get the email because you use hotmail or something stupid like That and the spam filter is overly aggressive.

715
00:52:34,031 --> 00:52:42,090
Rym: Not only have we never denied entry to anyone but we've only ever Banned one person and good God was that kid annoying?

716
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:47,950
Scott: Yes, and if you would like to apply for membership to the forum if you wait, maybe I don't know.

717
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:57,539
Scott: There's a hundred percent guarantee that within 12 hours you are going to get approved if anything by the next episode of GeekNights.

718
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:06,205
Scott: if there is an episode of GeekNights that was not pre-recorded and You hear it and you applied for the forums before that episode airs.

719
00:53:06,586 --> 00:53:07,730
Scott: You are now a member of the forums.
