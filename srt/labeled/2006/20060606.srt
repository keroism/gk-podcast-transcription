00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,531
Rym: It's Tuesday June 6th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:15,500
Rym: We review the new Super Mario Brothers for the DS.

3
00:00:17,061 --> 00:00:18,078
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:19,241 --> 00:00:22,453
Rym: So today I was walking around at my job doing various things.

5
00:00:22,473 --> 00:00:28,900
Scott: I ended up sitting in a waiting room for a while While you work at the hospital and you had to sit in the waiting room with the patients.

6
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:31,234
Rym: Well, no not with patients with other employers.

7
00:00:31,274 --> 00:00:32,299
Rym: Oh, it was a waiting room.

8
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:33,377
Rym: It was not the waiting room.

9
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:41,660
Rym: So I'm sitting in there and people are talking about the fact that today is 6606, you know the devil's day and all that bullshit.

10
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:51,900
Rym: Now a couple of the people were funny and they were like, oh, yeah, haha, but one girl woman was Kind of like no, but seriously, it's a bad day.

11
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,724
Rym: It's not over yet.

12
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:56,059
Rym: And this other guy was trying to explain to her that you know.

13
00:00:56,963 --> 00:01:00,256
Rym: The calendars moved all around and for all you know, it could have been any day.

14
00:01:00,276 --> 00:01:01,340
Rym: It wasn't really this day.

15
00:01:01,521 --> 00:01:03,026
Scott: It could have been four years ago.

16
00:01:03,046 --> 00:01:04,110
Scott: the calendar messed up.

17
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:05,474
Scott: It could be six one.

18
00:01:05,535 --> 00:01:06,660
Scott: six is the real number.

19
00:01:07,302 --> 00:01:09,189
Scott: So it's not even today.

20
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,077
Rym: and but the woman was like, it's a bad day.

21
00:01:11,097 --> 00:01:11,880
Rym: It's a bad day.

22
00:01:12,021 --> 00:01:13,430
Rym: I'm just going straight home and going to bed.

23
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:14,659
Rym: I don't want anything bad to happen.

24
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:19,668
Rym: Okay, yeah That's that's all I got.

25
00:01:19,688 --> 00:01:26,599
Scott: I got some real news, but Wow I know people who are a little bit, you know superstitious.

26
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:27,902
Rym: Scott.

27
00:01:27,942 --> 00:01:28,183
Rym: mr.

28
00:01:28,223 --> 00:01:29,406
Rym: Throw salt over his shoulders.

29
00:01:29,446 --> 00:01:30,971
Scott: No superstition associated with it.

30
00:01:31,352 --> 00:01:33,760
Rym: Wait, wait, wait, wait, you're saying so why do you throw salt?

31
00:01:34,703 --> 00:01:36,400
Rym: I got to bring this up now that I got an audience.

32
00:01:37,062 --> 00:01:44,360
Rym: Why do you when you knock salt over and spill some choose to waste more of it by throwing it over your shoulder?

33
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,940
Scott: I got a new explanation for this one because my other explanations weren't good enough for you.

34
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,649
Rym: Well, your other explanation was because something bad would happen.

35
00:01:52,669 --> 00:01:54,395
Scott: No, it wasn't my other explanation at all.

36
00:01:54,435 --> 00:01:55,739
Rym: What was your other explanation then?

37
00:01:56,941 --> 00:01:57,443
Scott: Doesn't matter.

38
00:01:57,463 --> 00:01:58,448
Scott: I have a new explanation.

39
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:04,740
Rym: Okay tradition tradition Tentacles tentacles.

40
00:02:06,563 --> 00:02:08,120
Rym: Yeah, Scott's got his salt superstition.

41
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:09,806
Scott: It's not as superstition as it is.

42
00:02:09,847 --> 00:02:15,849
Rym: you you used to tell us that you throw the salt over your shoulder because something bad might Happen if you don't but you wouldn't say what might happen.

43
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,997
Scott: if I do it's not gonna change the odds.

44
00:02:18,258 --> 00:02:18,860
Rym: then why do it?

45
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,164
Rym: You're doing something.

46
00:02:21,345 --> 00:02:24,879
Rym: You're doing something suboptimal and wasting resources because I like to.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,528
Scott: Okay Not allowed to like doing something.

48
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,237
Rym: could you deal with not doing it?

49
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:35,919
Rym: You seem to get agitated if it doesn't happen or if someone prevents you from doing it.

50
00:02:38,029 --> 00:02:40,637
Rym: Man Yeah, that was that was a good answer.

51
00:02:42,043 --> 00:02:49,375
Rym: Yeah, I I I encourage everyone in the forums, you know Especially since someone yelled at me for making fun of Scott on the show too much.

52
00:02:49,476 --> 00:02:50,540
Rym: So I'm gonna lay in today.

53
00:02:51,022 --> 00:02:52,810
Scott: Why do you put your pants on right leg first?

54
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,196
Scott: Why don't you put on left leg first?

55
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:57,088
Rym: Oh, um I usually put them on both legs at the same time.

56
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:58,735
Scott: Oh, why don't you do one leg at a time?

57
00:02:58,895 --> 00:02:59,518
Rym: Sometimes I do.

58
00:02:59,538 --> 00:03:01,346
Rym: Oh You know what though?

59
00:03:01,627 --> 00:03:03,580
Rym: Nothing bad will happen if I put my body.

60
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:07,616
Scott: Why do you put the bits of lettuce in the in a celery in the salad?

61
00:03:07,656 --> 00:03:08,720
Scott: that shouldn't go in the salad?

62
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,185
Rym: They should go in the salad.

63
00:03:10,205 --> 00:03:10,929
Rym: Oh, there's no greens.

64
00:03:11,271 --> 00:03:12,980
Scott: No restaurant puts that in the salad.

65
00:03:13,141 --> 00:03:14,819
Rym: You're the same person who won't eat dandelions.

66
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,445
Scott: Ten lines aren't food.

67
00:03:16,465 --> 00:03:20,439
Scott: head lines are most definitely only if you're a dirty hippie who will eat grass and shit.

68
00:03:20,941 --> 00:03:33,192
Rym: Anyway, I would just like to behoove all of our wonderful forum people out there especially the people who have argued with Scott about religion or superstition in the past months to uh Talk about his salt superstition.

69
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:34,540
Scott: It's not a superstition.

70
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,725
Rym: Yeah, all right.

71
00:03:37,288 --> 00:03:43,793
Rym: then in some real news the six bone Which I'll explain what that is in a minute is finally going away.

72
00:03:43,994 --> 00:03:52,401
Scott: It's not the sixth bone in your body No, nor does it have anything to do with paleontology or archaeology or Anatomy.

73
00:03:52,602 --> 00:03:57,656
Rym: it however has a lot to do with my experiences at RIT as an IIT student.

74
00:03:58,438 --> 00:03:59,180
Rym: You okay there Scott?

75
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,647
Scott: I'm still laughing from one of the things.

76
00:04:01,728 --> 00:04:05,205
Scott: I laugh too hard at one of the things of the day and I screwed up my Throat, uh-huh.

77
00:04:05,266 --> 00:04:06,130
Scott: So I'm coughing a lot.

78
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,360
Rym: It could be the chemicals wafting in from the hallway.

79
00:04:09,141 --> 00:04:27,740
Rym: So I went to RIT to study information technology and as a result I did a lot of networking stuff and a project that I actually never completed because I dropped out of the class But I started it low involved ipv6 Which is the theoretical successor to ipv4, which is what is currently running the internet.

80
00:04:28,683 --> 00:04:34,380
Rym: Now I could go into great detail about this But I'm sure none of you care because it's not tech day or anything and you're just here for your gaming.

81
00:04:35,461 --> 00:04:43,139
Rym: But you know IP addresses, you know, like 129 21 21.1 Though there aren't that many of those.

82
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:46,412
Rym: There are only so many of those numbers that we can use and we're running out.

83
00:04:47,135 --> 00:05:03,420
Rym: The proposed solution is ipv6 or IP version 6 as opposed to version 4 which Basically gives you enough IP addresses to assign Millions of them to every square meter of the Earth's surface including the oceans and still have plenty of spare.

84
00:05:04,943 --> 00:05:13,740
Scott: so the idea of ipv6 is that Every single electronic device in the entire world could have an IP address and it wouldn't matter.

85
00:05:14,263 --> 00:05:21,759
Scott: even if you had everyone carried around like a hundred devices and They were all like minuscule nano devices.

86
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:23,787
Scott: It wouldn't matter.

87
00:05:24,109 --> 00:05:37,190
Rym: It also solves a lot of the problems we currently have with IP like multicasting doesn't work so well and load balancing has to be done in kind of hackish ways and DHCP which is a way to get IP addresses out of the ether.

88
00:05:37,732 --> 00:05:38,435
Rym: We need that.

89
00:05:38,495 --> 00:05:41,990
Rym: while an ipv6 you could really set up a network where that's not necessary.

90
00:05:42,653 --> 00:05:50,681
Rym: IPv6 is all-around good, but for a variety of reasons No one has really gotten into it and it really hasn't taken off in the real world.

91
00:05:51,383 --> 00:06:03,758
Rym: The six bone was a testbed a branch of IPv6 that was dedicated to students and professors and technical experts to study play with test and generally muck around with ipv6.

92
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:12,435
Rym: I Myself had a fairly large swath of six bone addresses to use in a project for a class I was taking at RIT.

93
00:06:12,656 --> 00:06:18,314
Scott: considering there are millions and millions and millions and millions of addresses Billions of addresses.

94
00:06:18,414 --> 00:06:22,770
Scott: even having a large swath of them is not difficult to get I hooked to quill.

95
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,758
Rym: It was difficult to get if you weren't in a school.

96
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:27,650
Scott: Oh, yeah, of course, but if you ask they just gave you look.

97
00:06:28,293 --> 00:06:31,850
Rym: Yeah, but you had to be going to a school that had the ability to ask of course.

98
00:06:32,031 --> 00:06:32,955
Rym: I mean went to RIT.

99
00:06:33,015 --> 00:06:34,943
Rym: We had the friggin best internet connection in the world.

100
00:06:34,984 --> 00:06:40,963
Rym: there close to it We had two oc3s a t2 t3s and a bunch of asdl backups.

101
00:06:41,464 --> 00:06:42,367
Scott: Yeah a DSL.

102
00:06:42,587 --> 00:06:42,788
Scott: Yeah.

103
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:50,416
Rym: Yep But anyway, I then dropped out of that class and didn't do much with the six bone though I did connect two computers to it at one point.

104
00:06:50,697 --> 00:06:53,126
Rym: Ooh, and now it's going away.

105
00:06:53,186 --> 00:06:54,210
Rym: They're finished testing.

106
00:06:54,371 --> 00:06:55,920
Rym: They no longer need the six bone.

107
00:06:56,323 --> 00:06:56,846
Rym: It is gone.

108
00:06:57,007 --> 00:06:57,449
Rym: It is dead.

109
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,274
Scott: IPV6 isn't dead.

110
00:06:59,434 --> 00:07:07,630
Rym: You can still do it the right way even though no one is really doing it and IPV6 Probably isn't going to take off anytime soon.

111
00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:11,549
Scott: Yeah If you really want to do experiments with IPV6 the thing is out there.

112
00:07:12,271 --> 00:07:16,946
Scott: Pretty much all the software in the world supports it at least all the good software now have.

113
00:07:16,986 --> 00:07:18,290
Rym: most software doesn't support it.

114
00:07:18,712 --> 00:07:27,690
Scott: Oh, if you have a Linux machine, it supports it 90% perfectly But the actual internet doesn't support it and nor does your internet service provider.

115
00:07:28,352 --> 00:07:33,490
Scott: So what you can do is you can set up a LAN in your house that uses IPV6 all you want.

116
00:07:34,592 --> 00:07:35,517
Scott: You just can't.

117
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,707
Scott: you know, the internet isn't running IPV6 yet.

118
00:07:38,712 --> 00:07:41,790
Scott: They'd need to upgrade all sorts of routers and things which isn't gonna happen.

119
00:07:43,211 --> 00:07:45,397
Scott: Okay, I got two combined.

120
00:07:45,457 --> 00:07:46,220
Scott: news is here.

121
00:07:46,681 --> 00:07:48,486
Rym: Yeah, he changed his news suddenly on me.

122
00:07:48,988 --> 00:07:49,529
Scott: That's fine.

123
00:07:50,414 --> 00:07:54,850
Scott: first news some guy in with the Ukraine Kiev Kiev.

124
00:07:56,156 --> 00:07:56,559
Rym: He

125
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:13,730
Scott: went to a lion cage and He was going down a rope into the lion cage and he said if a god exists he won't let me die or something like that probably in Russian and He was mauled and killed immediately by the Lions who slit his jugular vein.

126
00:08:14,852 --> 00:08:18,910
Scott: Okay, God did not protect him from the Lions.

127
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:33,649
Scott: another story Unrelated but related There was a big storm somewhere and this woman went outside to pray That her family would be protected from the storm.

128
00:08:34,611 --> 00:08:36,590
Scott: She was immediately struck by lightning.

129
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,616
Scott: There was no God.

130
00:08:39,381 --> 00:08:39,764
Scott: I don't think.

131
00:08:39,825 --> 00:08:46,410
Rym: I don't think that's news But I think you're discounting the possibilities that there is a God and he's an asshole That there is a God and he has a sense of humor.

132
00:08:47,051 --> 00:08:58,430
Rym: That there is a God and he wanted to make an example out of these people That there are a whole bunch of gods and they weren't paying attention That there's a great dragon in the sky and he was just pissed at this woman.

133
00:08:59,411 --> 00:09:05,761
Scott: Yeah, you know what believing any of those things is better than what most of the religious not bags believe because they don't believe any of that.

134
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:07,473
Rym: So that's your news.

135
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,316
Scott: Yep.

136
00:09:08,737 --> 00:09:09,419
Rym: All right, great.

137
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:10,623
Rym: Let's go to things today.

138
00:09:10,924 --> 00:09:12,187
Scott: Like there wasn't any gaming news.

139
00:09:12,207 --> 00:09:12,829
Scott: What do you want from me?

140
00:09:19,674 --> 00:09:29,149
Rym: I got a thing today here and Once again, I haven't found anything really particularly new or exciting on the internet in quite some time And I've run out of cool retro things to link to.

141
00:09:30,073 --> 00:09:44,716
Rym: So I just wandered around and I stumbled upon an old Photoshop or not actually Photoshop Friday But a comedy goldmine on something awful truth in gaming and it's you know, just funny, you know cover of a game and The truth about that game.

142
00:09:44,897 --> 00:09:45,719
Scott: well board games.

143
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:47,605
Rym: Yeah, it could have been any game.

144
00:09:47,645 --> 00:09:55,748
Rym: just no one did video games But the best one far and away was to Magic the Gathering and it was money the wasting.

145
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:59,177
Rym: ha ha That's the best I can do.

146
00:09:59,237 --> 00:10:01,689
Rym: the internet has not amused me in several weeks.

147
00:10:02,496 --> 00:10:03,869
Scott: There are some other good ones in there.

148
00:10:04,351 --> 00:10:07,923
Scott: I did learn from this Photoshop that clue.

149
00:10:08,305 --> 00:10:12,170
Scott: the game of clue is Actually called clue do in Britain.

150
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:17,150
Scott: It was originally a British game and they changed it to clue when they brought it over to America.

151
00:10:17,774 --> 00:10:20,009
Scott: I will now forever call the game clue do.

152
00:10:21,011 --> 00:10:23,939
Scott: Also, they changed the guy, you know, mr.

153
00:10:23,979 --> 00:10:25,744
Scott: Body include the guy who gets killed.

154
00:10:26,165 --> 00:10:27,469
Scott: apparently he's really named.

155
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:28,212
Scott: Dr Black.

156
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:29,637
Scott: I will now call him.

157
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:30,300
Scott: Dr.

158
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:30,681
Scott: Black.

159
00:10:30,862 --> 00:10:32,830
Rym: Well, you couldn't have a racist game in the US.

160
00:10:32,991 --> 00:10:36,283
Rym: I mean who dies first the black dude, but you have mrs.

161
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:36,784
Scott: White.

162
00:10:37,126 --> 00:10:38,230
Rym: Yeah, that's fine.

163
00:10:38,851 --> 00:10:41,298
Scott: What about general Custer Colonel custard?

164
00:10:41,338 --> 00:10:42,622
Rym: Well, he'll go out mustard.

165
00:10:42,762 --> 00:10:45,350
Rym: He'll go after miss Scarlett because she's you know red.

166
00:10:46,651 --> 00:10:50,790
Rym: Yeah, yeah, I I'm not sure why they actually changed the name.

167
00:10:51,011 --> 00:10:54,230
Rym: I wouldn't be surprised if it was some sort of fear of racism charges.

168
00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:57,458
Scott: Why did they just call him doctor?

169
00:10:58,099 --> 00:10:59,883
Scott: I don't know some other color that wasn't in there.

170
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:00,545
Scott: Dr.

171
00:11:00,605 --> 00:11:01,708
Rym: Orange, dr.

172
00:11:01,908 --> 00:11:04,513
Rym: African Dr.

173
00:11:04,553 --> 00:11:06,080
Rym: Black bastard, dr.

174
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,481
Scott: Gray.

175
00:11:06,501 --> 00:11:10,319
Rym: Ah, yeah anyway You got a thing of the day.

176
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,146
Rym: Oh, yeah.

177
00:11:12,591 --> 00:11:17,310
Scott: So there's these two videos not sure if they were actually real commercials or if they were just made.

178
00:11:17,431 --> 00:11:20,910
Scott: I think they were made by a marketing company, but they're pretty funny.

179
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,158
Scott: They're commercials for Street Fighter or some Street Fighter game.

180
00:11:24,258 --> 00:11:26,925
Scott: Probably I think a Street Fighter alpha anthology of some sorts.

181
00:11:27,065 --> 00:11:27,426
Scott: I don't know.

182
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,640
Scott: and The funny one is two of them.

183
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:32,170
Scott: One of them is less funny.

184
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,408
Scott: I'll let you watch that on your own.

185
00:11:33,811 --> 00:11:38,550
Scott: The first one this guy makes a popcorn in the microwave and it explodes.

186
00:11:38,992 --> 00:11:40,017
Scott: I think it's a jiffy pops.

187
00:11:40,037 --> 00:11:41,584
Scott: You're not even supposed to put it in a microwave.

188
00:11:41,745 --> 00:11:42,770
Rym: Well, yeah, it was metal.

189
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:43,794
Rym: I think that's the point.

190
00:11:43,914 --> 00:11:48,409
Scott: Yeah, so after it explodes it says on the screen bad move.

191
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:58,930
Scott: then he goes and he puts the popcorn on the counter and he Hadouken's it and a little fireball comes out and it hits the popcorn and it turns into a bowl of popcorn.

192
00:11:59,231 --> 00:12:02,100
Scott: After the Hadouken hits it and says good move.

193
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:05,270
Rym: Honestly, uh these I didn't really find these that funny.

194
00:12:05,812 --> 00:12:09,746
Rym: They happen to reference the game and that's really the only thing they have going for him.

195
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:10,870
Scott: Oh, I think it's funny.

196
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,335
Scott: Yeah, I didn't see it coming.

197
00:12:12,355 --> 00:12:15,350
Rym: Yeah, I saw it coming because I knew what they were ahead of time.

198
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:19,145
Scott: Yeah, plus it was just kind of forget what I said and go click on the link.

199
00:12:19,226 --> 00:12:20,130
Rym: It was just kind of lame.

200
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:20,693
Rym: I'm sorry.

201
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:21,516
Scott: No, you suck.

202
00:12:21,998 --> 00:12:23,365
Rym: We haven't had good things of the day lately.

203
00:12:23,465 --> 00:12:24,570
Scott: It is going after me today.

204
00:12:25,951 --> 00:12:26,954
Scott: You're thinking today sucked.

205
00:12:27,215 --> 00:12:27,677
Rym: Yeah, I did.

206
00:12:27,737 --> 00:12:28,781
Rym: I fully admitted to it.

207
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:29,523
Rym: Yeah.

208
00:12:29,764 --> 00:12:31,310
Rym: I just couldn't find anything funny on the internet.

209
00:12:31,491 --> 00:12:33,178
Rym: There wasn't old-school like.

210
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:35,730
Rym: I've seen it a million times and it's all I mean I could do Numa Numa.

211
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,298
Rym: Yeah, we've never linked to Numa Numa.

212
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:41,250
Scott: Maybe we should start having a like users submit.

213
00:12:41,411 --> 00:12:43,099
Scott: Oh, no, give users submit thing of the days.

214
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:44,044
Scott: They'll just submit things.

215
00:12:44,084 --> 00:12:45,270
Scott: We've seen a hundred times.

216
00:12:46,393 --> 00:12:47,121
Scott: Well think of something.

217
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:47,829
Rym: Yeah.

218
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:55,249
Rym: Anyway today being gaming day We decided we would talk about the new Mario game for the DS that came out since we both finally fully beaten it.

219
00:12:55,852 --> 00:12:59,408
Scott: Yep, I've beaten every level but I'm still working on getting all the big coins.

220
00:12:59,729 --> 00:13:02,870
Rym: Yep I've eaten every level and I haven't had time to bother with going after the coins.

221
00:13:03,552 --> 00:13:05,801
Scott: Alright, so let's talk about the game a bit.

222
00:13:06,303 --> 00:13:11,249
Rym: It's a standard 2d Platformer old-school kind of Mario with a little bit of twists.

223
00:13:11,872 --> 00:13:18,170
Scott: Well, the first thing that's different from normal Mario is that not only can you jump and shoot fireballs?

224
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:27,433
Scott: But you can do a lot of the moves that you can do in Mario 64 like triple jump ground pound ground pound wall jump Etc.

225
00:13:28,095 --> 00:13:32,750
Scott: that helps a lot and provides for a lot of interesting new things.

226
00:13:33,352 --> 00:13:46,234
Scott: There are a lot of maps where if you were say Mario from Mario 3 It would just be impossible because you don't have the moves to do the map or you don't have the moves to get the coins In certain places,

227
00:13:46,696 --> 00:13:53,029
Rym: but at the same time the control which we'll talk about more later Mario's a little bit full of momentum and a little loose.

228
00:13:53,772 --> 00:14:00,090
Scott: Yeah in Mario 3 you would let go of the arrows and Mario would stop like very quickly like stopped.

229
00:14:00,665 --> 00:14:10,958
Scott: You know I mean if you went if you're running right and you push left Mario would go and stop almost immediately and this one Mario kind of Slows down like whoa.

230
00:14:10,978 --> 00:14:11,501
Scott: Whoa.

231
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:11,802
Scott: Whoa.

232
00:14:11,822 --> 00:14:12,043
Scott: Whoa.

233
00:14:12,123 --> 00:14:20,089
Scott: It's it's you're on ice Basically on a little bit of ice constantly until you get to the ice world until you're on the ice world Then you're on super ice.

234
00:14:21,174 --> 00:14:32,630
Scott: You get used to it after a while But the first time you play if you're used to other Mario games It can be slightly annoying and yet to just keep playing until you get used to it and then it's alright.

235
00:14:32,992 --> 00:14:35,164
Rym: The main effect of this is that playing the game is more.

236
00:14:35,204 --> 00:14:36,611
Rym: I mean Mario 3.

237
00:14:36,611 --> 00:14:45,770
Rym: The cool way to play and really all the Mario's was to generally be running all the time and going through the game very quickly But also getting all the important secrets.

238
00:14:46,272 --> 00:14:54,452
Scott: So if there were two paths one with coins and one without you would jump and get the coins And if there was a pipe you would stop and go in it Etc.

239
00:14:54,532 --> 00:15:01,848
Rym: But at the same time you could also almost always like if a thing looked dangerous Stop and do it real slowly and carefully and almost always get through it.

240
00:15:02,371 --> 00:15:06,849
Rym: Yep, the new Mario game because you're so full of momentum and so kind of loosey-goosey.

241
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,779
Rym: I don't know why I said loosey-goosey.

242
00:15:09,001 --> 00:15:10,187
Rym: That's a terrible thing to say.

243
00:15:10,267 --> 00:15:13,137
Rym: It's fine It really enforces the.

244
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:21,521
Rym: you have to be pretty much running through the game at full tilt and any time you hesitate the game Punishes you and I think what happens is early.

245
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:33,322
Scott: when I was first playing that's what the situation was But later on as I got used to these slight loosey-goose enos I would stop earlier and I had better control over it.

246
00:15:33,463 --> 00:15:40,099
Scott: So I was able to stop and do certain things but overall Is an example.

247
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:47,950
Scott: there's a part in the game where you know The spiky ceiling comes down and goes up and there are areas that you make it from one safe area to the next.

248
00:15:48,954 --> 00:15:52,790
Scott: You can run from one safe area to the next but it's kind of crummy.

249
00:15:53,351 --> 00:15:59,590
Scott: It's actually easier to run like go full tilt and do every second or every third safe area.

250
00:16:00,495 --> 00:16:06,381
Scott: You know if you try to stop and do it carefully It's more likely that the spikes will get you then.

251
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:08,930
Scott: if you were to just run run run run run jump stop.

252
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:12,489
Rym: Now the game also adds two new items.

253
00:16:13,352 --> 00:16:15,921
Rym: I mean Mario 3 was famous because I added a whole bunch of items.

254
00:16:15,981 --> 00:16:19,773
Rym: know the frog suit the tanuki suit the hammer suit The leaf.

255
00:16:20,475 --> 00:16:23,203
Rym: yeah, this game goes back to the basics with two little twists.

256
00:16:23,965 --> 00:16:25,510
Scott: Well three three twists.

257
00:16:25,973 --> 00:16:31,665
Scott: Oh, yeah, there's the mushroom duh There's the fire flower duh, there's the star duh.

258
00:16:32,731 --> 00:16:34,897
Scott: The first twist is the mega mushroom.

259
00:16:34,957 --> 00:16:38,126
Scott: now, you've probably seen the mega mushroom in action.

260
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:43,438
Scott: It makes Mario or Luigi Ridiculously huge and they smash everything.

261
00:16:43,678 --> 00:16:52,047
Rym: you get a meter at the top while you're big and it goes up the more things you smash And then you get a bunch of one-ups based on how much stuff you've destroyed while you were big.

262
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:53,534
Scott: Yep No, it's not.

263
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:53,734
Scott: it's.

264
00:16:53,835 --> 00:16:56,666
Scott: it's a lot of fun, but it's not everything.

265
00:16:56,826 --> 00:17:02,470
Rym: It's cracked up to be It's not useful in most worlds and it doesn't really do much for you.

266
00:17:03,192 --> 00:17:10,890
Scott: Yeah, I mean there are some worlds where at the beginning of the world there'd be a million bricks and bad guys And it's like the perfect spot to use the mega mushroom.

267
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:22,419
Scott: but there are other worlds where you know, even though giant Mario or giant Luigi can just kick pipes out of the way and Completely destroy any bad guys and bricks and whatnot.

268
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,781
Scott: There will be holes.

269
00:17:23,821 --> 00:17:25,867
Scott: You can't get over or there will be.

270
00:17:25,887 --> 00:17:31,845
Scott: you know Whole places you can't fit into because you're too big and you can't get.

271
00:17:31,905 --> 00:17:33,250
Scott: you can't proceed in the levels.

272
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:36,950
Scott: You just have to wait for the giant mushroom to wear off before you can keep going.

273
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:41,609
Rym: Luckily the game won't let you pick up a big mushroom if you're in an area where you couldn't use it at all.

274
00:17:42,011 --> 00:17:43,096
Scott: Yeah, but it won't hurt you.

275
00:17:43,136 --> 00:17:47,816
Scott: if you try to use your big mushroom and somewhere you can't it won't take it away from you It just won't let you use it.

276
00:17:48,278 --> 00:17:50,829
Rym: Now the item number two they added is the turtle shell.

277
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:54,305
Scott: Turtle shell is sort of its ass.

278
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:55,450
Scott: It's a double-edged sword.

279
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:58,424
Scott: It's a double-edged sword if you practice like hell.

280
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:07,000
Rym: you could become good at it but you'll beat the game into the ground long before you would have practiced it enough and The multiplayer is not that good as we'll get to.

281
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,290
Rym: so there's really no purpose to ever use the shell.

282
00:18:09,663 --> 00:18:11,828
Scott: Okay There are two purposes for the shell.

283
00:18:12,395 --> 00:18:13,569
Scott: first purpose for the shell.

284
00:18:14,172 --> 00:18:16,700
Scott: It lets you go if you're in the water a water level.

285
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,950
Scott: the shell is awesome because Mario can swim like a mofo with the shell.

286
00:18:20,695 --> 00:18:28,879
Scott: Yeah, even though I'd rather still have my fire flower I would I'd say the fire flower and the shell are equal But it does depend on the water level.

287
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:36,749
Scott: if there's a lot of cheeps and a lot of bloopers you want the fire But if it's one with a lot of blowing pipes, then you want the turtle shell.

288
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:51,370
Scott: The turtle shell also is used to get into some secrets on occasion and that can be useful and certain levels are designed With hills in such a way that the shell can let you just burn right through and kill a bunch of bad guys.

289
00:18:51,972 --> 00:18:56,530
Scott: But that really very few levels are like that other than that if you use the shell.

290
00:18:57,252 --> 00:19:02,530
Scott: The way it works is that you run full tilt and then you duck into the shell and now you don't even have to duck.

291
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,520
Rym: If you start running fast enough you automatically shell.

292
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:15,870
Scott: yeah, you turn into a turtle shell you'll bounce off walls You can jump But you can't really change direction or slow down and you can undo the shell at any time and turn back into Mario.

293
00:19:16,432 --> 00:19:20,270
Rym: But the action to do it is kind of counterintuitive, and I've never done it reflexively.

294
00:19:20,431 --> 00:19:22,942
Scott: Yeah, you do it by I think letting go of B right.

295
00:19:23,484 --> 00:19:26,198
Rym: I think in hitting out for something You just let go of B.

296
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:32,850
Scott: The thing is when I'm in the shell You know it's kind of I feel like I'm ducking and I want to push up to get out of the shell.

297
00:19:33,534 --> 00:19:35,508
Scott: So it's like I have to consciously think let go of B.

298
00:19:36,711 --> 00:19:41,290
Rym: Most likely if you're in shell mode you will go you bump bump into a hole.

299
00:19:41,732 --> 00:19:43,058
Scott: That's what happens most of the time.

300
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,570
Rym: luckily you don't really need the shell for anything.

301
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,614
Rym: It's just something to play with.

302
00:19:46,855 --> 00:19:54,870
Rym: you do need it to get a few of the secrets like the cannons in certain levels Yeah, but you can do that with a bunch of turtle shells and a lot of tenacity.

303
00:19:55,771 --> 00:20:01,470
Scott: Well what I do is I keep a turtle shell in the reserve I get to the secret I turn the turtle shell on I get the secret

304
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:04,922
Rym: I just go harvesting Koopa Troopas and throwing them at whatever secret it is and then

305
00:20:05,343 --> 00:20:09,323
Scott: there are some secrets where you can't get The the Koopa Troopa near it.

306
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:14,567
Scott: like there are secrets They make the level in such a way where the only way to get through is if you have the turtle shell.

307
00:20:14,668 --> 00:20:18,847
Rym: yeah luckily I beat almost the entire game, and I just ignored all those secrets, and I didn't miss much.

308
00:20:19,249 --> 00:20:22,620
Scott: yep They're mostly warp zones and that sort of thing.

309
00:20:23,403 --> 00:20:26,174
Scott: some of them will help you get to there.

310
00:20:26,194 --> 00:20:34,580
Scott: basically a lot of secrets that get you the same result and Some secrets will get you the result easier or more Difficultly and you can pick either one you want.

311
00:20:35,042 --> 00:20:42,629
Rym: the last item is the mini mushroom Which is basically only a skip levels real easily and go to secret areas item.

312
00:20:43,394 --> 00:20:52,349
Scott: Yeah, the mini mushroom makes you really really small Which helps you get into secret areas where the there's a really really small hole or an extra small pipe to go into.

313
00:20:52,389 --> 00:20:54,699
Rym: now being Small any hit kills you.

314
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,070
Rym: you can't even squash goombas.

315
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:05,669
Rym: Yeah, if you jump on a goomba you just bounce off you can ground pound the goomba though You could jump really really high and really really far and you can fit into holes.

316
00:21:06,073 --> 00:21:07,206
Rym: Mm-hmm that's it.

317
00:21:08,093 --> 00:21:17,230
Scott: Yeah, it basically makes playing the game normally harder But it allows you to play the game differently where you can go real far real fast and go into secrets.

318
00:21:17,753 --> 00:21:31,830
Scott: There are quite a few secrets that require the mini mushroom Because you need to kick off a wall and go flying really far to reach an opposite ledge with the mini mushroom Or in fact the two secret worlds that they're on the board.

319
00:21:31,871 --> 00:21:35,560
Rym: They're not much of a secret But you know there's world one two three four five six seven eight.

320
00:21:36,021 --> 00:21:39,733
Rym: two of the worlds are optional four and well Three and four.

321
00:21:39,834 --> 00:21:46,794
Scott: it's one then two then three or four kind of like outrun where if you go left you go to world Three and you go to.

322
00:21:46,915 --> 00:21:48,362
Scott: if you go right you go to world four.

323
00:21:48,784 --> 00:21:52,963
Scott: well to get to world four You have to beat world three as micro Mario.

324
00:21:53,285 --> 00:21:54,430
Rym: Yeah the same with world seven.

325
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:58,550
Scott: There is another way to get to world seven with a cannon and that's how I got there.

326
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,330
Rym: Yeah, I got there the normal way because it was easier.

327
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:05,550
Scott: Yeah, I got there by using a turtle shell on a secret which actually wasn't too hard because I had the shell in the reserve.

328
00:22:05,932 --> 00:22:16,150
Rym: So I got to the secret normally and then but I like the way the game clues you in because you beat You know the final castle area against a kid Koopa, and then you write like he runs off and you run after him.

329
00:22:16,531 --> 00:22:19,242
Rym: But right there before he runs off.

330
00:22:19,262 --> 00:22:21,169
Rym: There's a little hole that Mario just runs over.

331
00:22:21,972 --> 00:22:28,581
Rym: So I thought to myself huh, and I beat it again as a little Mario and instead of going across He fell in the hole and went to a different world.

332
00:22:28,843 --> 00:22:29,850
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty obvious.

333
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,863
Scott: You had to be an idiot not to realize it.

334
00:22:32,003 --> 00:22:34,435
Scott: when you see it You know she'd beat world two.

335
00:22:34,917 --> 00:22:36,101
Scott: you would see that secret.

336
00:22:36,141 --> 00:22:37,165
Scott: you'd go back to world two.

337
00:22:37,185 --> 00:22:39,393
Scott: you'd get the secret the same thing in World five.

338
00:22:39,856 --> 00:22:42,067
Scott: you would do the same exact thing to get to world seven.

339
00:22:42,408 --> 00:22:45,529
Rym: these worlds Don't unlock anything other than you get to play the world and they're fun.

340
00:22:46,151 --> 00:22:48,277
Scott: You really need to play all the worlds.

341
00:22:48,518 --> 00:22:48,658
Scott: what?

342
00:22:48,699 --> 00:22:51,506
Scott: level seven is a really really crazy world.

343
00:22:51,547 --> 00:22:56,038
Scott: level seven is great All right, what else serious about this game?

344
00:22:56,058 --> 00:22:56,741
Scott: now?

345
00:22:56,822 --> 00:22:57,746
Rym: the gameplay itself.

346
00:22:57,826 --> 00:22:58,609
Rym: I mean the game is fun.

347
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:02,902
Rym: It's I'd say it's a lot easier than say Mario 3.

348
00:23:02,902 --> 00:23:05,550
Scott: Oh, it's hella easier than Mario 3 or Mario world.

349
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:09,084
Scott: It has a lot of levels, but once you get the hang of it.

350
00:23:09,104 --> 00:23:10,289
Scott: You can just blow right through it.

351
00:23:10,651 --> 00:23:13,630
Rym: Yeah, I mean I blew through the game to the end in a couple days.

352
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:21,858
Scott: Yeah I think it took me under a week And I beat the game and then I unlocked World seven and I beat every world in that.

353
00:23:21,978 --> 00:23:31,230
Rym: so and the game has some decent replay value because you can go around and try To get all the big coins, which you you basically just used to unlock areas on the map that are obvious like mushroom houses.

354
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:42,210
Scott: Another thing is that the this big replay value and that if you burn through all the levels you didn't really fully Experience them and they have a lot more to offer than just running through them quickly.

355
00:23:42,753 --> 00:23:45,229
Scott: So by the time you've beaten the game you have a lot of skill.

356
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:53,197
Scott: So going back and playing all the levels over trying to collect the three giant coins in each level You'll actually then you will.

357
00:23:53,558 --> 00:24:05,209
Rym: it will be the first time you play out the levels and don't want to do them anymore But at the same time I don't find the game as expansive or as long-term replayable as Mario 3 and Mario World.

358
00:24:05,712 --> 00:24:07,137
Scott: No, I definitely don't.

359
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,250
Rym: I mean Mario world is just massive.

360
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:18,445
Rym: There's so much to that game and Mario 3. there are so many levels you almost never played because you know You can't save your game or anything.

361
00:24:18,465 --> 00:24:21,418
Scott: Yep I think that in.

362
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,338
Scott: I think whether they're like 80 levels in this game or something crazy like that You know, I don't even know.

363
00:24:26,378 --> 00:24:27,264
Rym: I just blew through it.

364
00:24:27,284 --> 00:24:28,050
Rym: I didn't really notice.

365
00:24:28,792 --> 00:24:29,595
Scott: I think that's what they said.

366
00:24:29,615 --> 00:24:36,837
Scott: there's something like 80 levels, but it does doesn't feel as big as Mario World or Mario 3.

367
00:24:36,837 --> 00:24:40,630
Rym: I mean Mario 3's levels are actually really really short compared to this game.

368
00:24:41,252 --> 00:24:44,602
Scott: Yeah, and they're really complex too, but I don't know.

369
00:24:44,823 --> 00:24:54,717
Scott: I played Mario 3 a zillion times But this game after I get all we'll see how long I can keep Collecting giant coins before I get sick of it.

370
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:59,489
Rym: Yeah, I mean I got sick of collecting stars in Mario 64. right quick Oh, yeah.

371
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:07,256
Scott: Well the first time I played Mario 64 I beat it and then I started collecting stars But I never got all of them.

372
00:25:07,316 --> 00:25:10,730
Scott: I got bored around star 90 or 80 or something like that.

373
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,799
Rym: Yeah, I think I made it on the DS.

374
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:17,579
Scott: I collected like two extra stars and I was done Yeah on the DS once I beat the game.

375
00:25:17,639 --> 00:25:18,302
Rym: I didn't bother.

376
00:25:18,342 --> 00:25:19,285
Rym: I never got another star.

377
00:25:19,687 --> 00:25:29,976
Scott: Yeah this game I'm still collecting the big coins because a lot of levels it is ran through just trying to get to the end and There's a lot more in those levels.

378
00:25:30,076 --> 00:25:37,266
Scott: So it's kind of like I'm still playing them for the first time But eventually I'm gonna when there's no more to experience.

379
00:25:37,326 --> 00:25:38,089
Scott: It's gonna dry up.

380
00:25:38,632 --> 00:25:45,690
Rym: I guess I just I was so used to you know old Mario games that the game is great and fun But it's really really easy at least to me.

381
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:51,650
Scott: Yeah, I wish there was some sort of hard mode like you beat it and then all the goombas turned to beetles.

382
00:25:51,953 --> 00:26:01,249
Rym: You know just like Mario 1 that would have been cool Yeah, or like Mario World where if you want you can go to the crazy star world and beat those Ridiculously difficult levels that they just threw in at the end.

383
00:26:01,972 --> 00:26:07,369
Scott: I really think that they should have added some sort of unlocked a bunch of extra stuff when you beat it.

384
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:14,047
Scott: Granted if it was just the original Mario or maybe the original Mario 2 or something.

385
00:26:14,749 --> 00:26:17,200
Rym: Yeah, I don't know I mean granted I haven't looked on game facts or anything.

386
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,170
Rym: I don't know what all is in there to unlock.

387
00:26:19,815 --> 00:26:21,870
Scott: I don't think there's that much more than what I've already got.

388
00:26:22,031 --> 00:26:30,336
Scott: I'm going to try to get all the big coins But I am gonna look on game facts to see what that gets me because if it's not a big prize I'm probably gonna stop eventually.

389
00:26:30,898 --> 00:26:33,590
Rym: now the game also comes with all the mini.

390
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:37,750
Rym: Well, most of the mini games from the original Mario 64 port to the DS.

391
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:43,135
Scott: Yeah, Mario 64 DS had a bunch of touchscreen demo games Which are little tiny mini games that were.

392
00:26:43,596 --> 00:26:48,130
Scott: they're just kind of thrown in there on the main menu screen like oh by the way.

393
00:26:49,392 --> 00:26:53,604
Rym: Now the one nice thing the upgrade I guess from the original 64 DS was that one.

394
00:26:54,066 --> 00:26:55,510
Rym: most of these games are multiplayer.

395
00:26:56,411 --> 00:27:00,101
Scott: I think there's more multiplayer games than there are single-player minigames.

396
00:27:00,142 --> 00:27:02,769
Rym: Yeah, and two there the games are somewhat better.

397
00:27:04,151 --> 00:27:10,110
Scott: Yeah, they took out my favorite game the shell bowling but they added quite a few other games that are real good.

398
00:27:10,351 --> 00:27:11,434
Rym: Yeah, the Othello is alright.

399
00:27:11,976 --> 00:27:15,830
Scott: Well, the Othello I think is one of the ones is only in multiplayer, but it's Bob-omb Othello.

400
00:27:16,211 --> 00:27:20,306
Scott: Yeah, I'll get four people playing Othello on the same map with four color Bob-ombs.

401
00:27:20,727 --> 00:27:21,390
Scott: That's cool.

402
00:27:22,253 --> 00:27:30,489
Rym: now the other multiplayer the actual like touted multiplayer that everyone was talking about is Kinda-ass.

403
00:27:31,112 --> 00:27:33,759
Scott: It's I think what it is disappointing.

404
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:38,111
Rym: It's it's no better or worse than the multiplayer in Mario 64.

405
00:27:38,111 --> 00:27:51,370
Scott: Yes, see when I saw the screenshots in the videos, I thought oh look at that You're going to have Mario and Luigi play the actual game cooperatively with two DS's wirelessly.

406
00:27:51,932 --> 00:27:54,403
Scott: So like me and Rym could team up to beat the game.

407
00:27:54,824 --> 00:27:56,009
Scott: that is not the case.

408
00:27:56,632 --> 00:28:02,837
Rym: It is just a four tiny maps and Mario and Luigi run around Collecting stars and fighting with each other.

409
00:28:03,178 --> 00:28:05,989
Rym: the fighting becomes whoever gets the fire flower first wins.

410
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:16,381
Scott: Yeah, if you jump on the other guy if you turtle shell the other guy if the other guy falls in a hole if the Guy dies if you fireball then a star pops out of his head.

411
00:28:16,923 --> 00:28:17,965
Scott: you collect the star.

412
00:28:18,126 --> 00:28:19,529
Scott: now you have one more star.

413
00:28:20,392 --> 00:28:26,550
Scott: Also stars appear in the level in random locations if they happen to appear near you and far away from the other guy.

414
00:28:27,034 --> 00:28:27,701
Scott: Good for you now

415
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:42,321
Rym: granted I learned because I played this game a bit multiplayer with Adam for a while and I discovered that if you set it to where you need like ten stars to win like a huge number of stars and you give Each other like three lives because you can give it.

416
00:28:42,362 --> 00:28:44,210
Rym: so people have lives and when you die you lose.

417
00:28:44,852 --> 00:28:50,994
Rym: It'd be the stars are there and everyone's going after them, but it's more a game of kill the other person Which is much more entertaining.

418
00:28:51,636 --> 00:28:54,123
Scott: yeah, but even that runs dry pretty quick.

419
00:28:54,645 --> 00:28:58,189
Rym: Yeah, it's just a quick quick pickup game Like you can just play it a little bit and then be done with it.

420
00:28:59,234 --> 00:29:00,749
Scott: It doesn't have a long term.

421
00:29:00,971 --> 00:29:05,970
Scott: It's not something you're gonna keep breaking out at conventions like Mario Kart or Tetris.

422
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:08,706
Rym: It's something you'd use to show people the game, and that's probably it.

423
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:14,516
Scott: yeah The multiplayer doesn't have a lot of reuse But you will play it a few times.

424
00:29:14,857 --> 00:29:19,350
Rym: it does have a really awesome loading screen if you play single cart mode.

425
00:29:20,193 --> 00:29:20,695
Scott: That is true.

426
00:29:20,896 --> 00:29:22,423
Rym: I'll let you discover that on your own.

427
00:29:22,443 --> 00:29:23,970
Rym: Yep, okay?

428
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,600
Scott: What else does new Mario have to offer?

429
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,210
Scott: a lot of retro awesomeness?

430
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,056
Rym: Yeah, like if you beat.

431
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:31,430
Rym: you know in the original Mario you get fireworks.

432
00:29:32,454 --> 00:29:38,210
Rym: This isn't for a prize or anything But if someone could post how you got fireworks in Mario brought when Super Mario Brothers one.

433
00:29:38,992 --> 00:29:46,899
Scott: I know how you get fireworks in all the Mario games that have fireworks yep as do I and you know what they're in this Game too, and they actually do something.

434
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:49,890
Scott: you can strategically get fireworks to help you out in your game.

435
00:29:50,351 --> 00:29:55,370
Rym: Yeah, well they just make mushroom houses appear and give you points and different kinds of mushroom houses room on the numbers.

436
00:29:55,490 --> 00:30:01,970
Scott: So if you need a big giant mushroom you can go for the big giant mushroom house by hitting the flag at a certain time.

437
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:04,744
Rym: And yeah, they also extended the flag.

438
00:30:05,025 --> 00:30:08,137
Rym: it is no longer Trivial to get to the top of the flag.

439
00:30:08,639 --> 00:30:12,954
Scott: yeah in Mario Super Mario Brothers if you were good You got what was.

440
00:30:12,995 --> 00:30:14,581
Scott: the top of the flag is 5,000 right?

441
00:30:14,601 --> 00:30:14,742
Rym: Yep?

442
00:30:14,802 --> 00:30:31,097
Scott: Yep now the flag goes 4,000 8,000 one up and also you know 2000 100 500 yeah all that crap pretty pretty much in every level you're either going to get low on the flag or Ridiculously high in the flag one time.

443
00:30:31,137 --> 00:30:35,030
Rym: I jumped way way over the flag and you got a one up.

444
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:41,430
Scott: Yeah, you can actually go down the other side of the flag to know if you jump just right.

445
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:44,053
Rym: Yep, I mean, that's it.

446
00:30:44,073 --> 00:30:45,217
Rym: It's just it's a Mario game.

447
00:30:45,317 --> 00:30:46,861
Rym: It's definitely worth buying.

448
00:30:47,463 --> 00:30:48,526
Scott: I'd say it's worth buying.

449
00:30:48,907 --> 00:30:56,890
Scott: if you're not a huge Fan of 2d platform games, then you should wait until the price goes down a little bit or maybe buy a used copy.

450
00:30:57,371 --> 00:30:59,398
Scott: But yeah, if you got a DS.

451
00:30:59,678 --> 00:31:03,370
Scott: You should get this and it will entertain you when you are bored alone.

452
00:31:04,311 --> 00:31:10,618
Scott: Not so much the multiplayer definitely not the multiplayer, but once you beat it You're pretty much done with it, but that's okay.

453
00:31:10,659 --> 00:31:11,964
Scott: cuz Phoenix Wright is the same way.

454
00:31:12,105 --> 00:31:13,210
Rym: yeah, and you know what's right?

455
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:13,996
Scott: It's freaking awesome.

456
00:31:14,157 --> 00:31:15,830
Rym: Yeah, I still think back to Phoenix.

457
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:29,068
Rym: I mean now it's weird, but I get a replay value from Phoenix right not for me playing it But from other people playing it and they'll say oh, I just got to the part where blah happens And I can say you haven't met blah yet.

458
00:31:30,653 --> 00:31:35,766
Scott: Oh, yeah new Mario doesn't have that but it is a great one-player DS game.

459
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:39,310
Rym: yes now That was a kind of a short episode which is fine.

460
00:31:39,651 --> 00:31:45,417
Rym: We've been doing long episodes almost every night for quite some time now Rims being a wuss and he wants to go to bed.

461
00:31:45,698 --> 00:31:48,950
Rym: well that and we kind of exhausted our topic earlier than we expected.

462
00:31:49,831 --> 00:31:50,915
Rym: Yep, there wasn't too much to say.

463
00:31:50,935 --> 00:31:55,730
Rym: the game is just a solid game with nothing special at all to it other than I just remembered.

464
00:31:55,912 --> 00:32:07,618
Rym: There's one really cool thing The mechanic of killing Bowser in the castles is the same in this game as it was in Super Mario Brothers 1 Except Bowser's in the castle.

465
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:10,890
Rym: at the end of the first world you've knocked that bridge out from under him.

466
00:32:11,193 --> 00:32:12,589
Rym: He falls in the lava and sinks.

467
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:13,752
Rym: Now.

468
00:32:14,114 --> 00:32:17,690
Rym: the other game didn't really address the physics of what happens if you fall into lava.

469
00:32:18,532 --> 00:32:29,890
Rym: So then a second later his dry dry bones float back up and then sink down and Bowser is dead Like dead as in dead and buried in bone, and that's the plot of the game.

470
00:32:30,175 --> 00:32:34,810
Scott: Yeah Like who would think that a side-scrolling game like this would have plot during the game?

471
00:32:35,011 --> 00:32:35,676
Scott: I mean Mario.

472
00:32:35,757 --> 00:32:41,443
Scott: all the other Mario games had plot But the plot was taken care of in the instruction book and at the ending.

473
00:32:41,804 --> 00:32:42,968
Scott: it was never taken care of.

474
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:52,769
Scott: in the middle of the game This Mario side-scroller actually has plot that it takes place at the first boss I think the and at the end of the game.

475
00:32:53,692 --> 00:32:54,274
Rym: Yeah, there's not.

476
00:32:54,294 --> 00:32:59,629
Rym: I mean there's not much there don't go expecting like a masterpiece of subtle allegory.

477
00:32:59,649 --> 00:33:10,305
Scott: no No, you won't but it's pretty interesting what goes on and it explains away Something in the original Super Mario Brothers that has everyone, you know that you might say.

478
00:33:10,346 --> 00:33:11,770
Scott: Hey, how did that make sense?

479
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:14,821
Scott: Well, here you go Sort of a back fix.

480
00:33:15,364 --> 00:33:16,128
Rym: Yeah, something like that.

481
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,674
Scott: So the story of Mario.

482
00:33:18,075 --> 00:33:22,650
Rym: unlike Princess Peach, which has a long unskippable opener that shows you all the plot.

483
00:33:23,211 --> 00:33:28,450
Rym: This game has the shortest flimsiest get-right-to-the-point opener ever.

484
00:33:28,931 --> 00:33:30,516
Rym: It shows Mario and the princess.

485
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:31,941
Rym: the princess gets kidnapped.

486
00:33:32,262 --> 00:33:33,245
Rym: Mario goes to save her.

487
00:33:33,706 --> 00:33:33,847
Scott: Yep.

488
00:33:34,067 --> 00:33:36,094
Rym: Go go go Oh and one last.

489
00:33:36,134 --> 00:33:36,756
Rym: you can skip it.

490
00:33:36,776 --> 00:33:37,539
Scott: You just push start.

491
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,810
Scott: you can turn this game on to be playing Mario in seconds.

492
00:33:41,731 --> 00:33:47,030
Rym: I'm gonna reveal a secret that was revealed to us when we beat the game and I thought I'd like the way it was.

493
00:33:47,232 --> 00:33:48,870
Scott: Everyone knows the secret but that's okay.

494
00:33:49,031 --> 00:33:53,050
Rym: Not if they haven't beaten it and they're not assholes who look at game facts before they play a game.

495
00:33:54,492 --> 00:33:58,767
Rym: But after you beat the game if you you know, all the credits roll by and it says the end.

496
00:33:58,807 --> 00:33:59,530
Rym: you can continue.

497
00:34:00,152 --> 00:34:14,777
Rym: But if you notice the background image because they don't say it anywhere just the background image real lightly says over and over again like L plus R plus A equals Luigi huh Isn't it just L plus A?

498
00:34:15,181 --> 00:34:16,629
Rym: Yeah, I think you just hit L R and A.

499
00:34:17,152 --> 00:34:17,514
Scott: I don't know.

500
00:34:17,654 --> 00:34:19,282
Scott: I can't remember if there's an R. try both.

501
00:34:19,563 --> 00:34:20,889
Scott: Yeah, regardless R couldn't hurt.

502
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:24,469
Rym: Yeah, if you do it and you hit A and you start your game you get to be Luigi.

503
00:34:24,911 --> 00:34:28,405
Scott: Yeah, I saw it in the background when I beat the game and I was like, huh?

504
00:34:28,565 --> 00:34:40,369
Scott: And then I was like, oh And then and then I did it and then I was like, yeah, I'm Luigi Yes, and then after I turned it off and came back to play again, I completely forgot about it.

505
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:44,041
Scott: Yeah, and I hadn't been Luigi until recently when I remembered again.

506
00:34:44,061 --> 00:34:48,069
Rym: I played Luigi pretty much constantly afterwards And I didn't look yet.

507
00:34:48,831 --> 00:34:51,079
Rym: I don't think Luigi is different.

508
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,094
Scott: Luigi is absolutely not different in any way other than color and Psychosomatic effects.

509
00:34:56,757 --> 00:34:59,610
Rym: that is the best he feels different even though he isn't.

510
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:03,864
Scott: He's green which is infinitely better than red and the way they draw him.

511
00:35:03,904 --> 00:35:06,953
Rym: He feels taller even though he isn't Nope hit by.

512
00:35:06,993 --> 00:35:08,098
Scott: everything's the same about him.

513
00:35:08,379 --> 00:35:10,770
Scott: You can duck under the same stuff and everything.

514
00:35:11,575 --> 00:35:19,575
Scott: One thing that actually adds to this game a lot I think are the is new interesting twists on the bad guys true like this.

515
00:35:19,655 --> 00:35:24,026
Scott: cool booze cool bloopers cool bullet bills for sure.

516
00:35:24,507 --> 00:35:38,847
Rym: cool hammer brothers you know the game is just incredibly solid and well put together like Remember when the GameCube came out and then smash brothers melee came out and that game was just like so well put together and so Good at what it was.

517
00:35:39,731 --> 00:35:43,369
Rym: Yep, this game's like that like every little element is put exactly where it should be.

518
00:35:43,832 --> 00:35:44,760
Rym: It's as good as this game.

519
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:49,623
Scott: will ever know how Smash Brothers Melee was so much better than Smash Brothers original on the 64.

520
00:35:49,623 --> 00:35:51,510
Scott: It was just that kind of improvement.

521
00:35:52,032 --> 00:35:57,573
Scott: this is that kind of improvement on Super Mario Brothers 1 yeah, and That's it.

522
00:35:57,915 --> 00:36:00,310
Rym: We got a bunch of meta bits though because we forgot to talk about him yesterday.

523
00:36:00,913 --> 00:36:02,403
Scott: Oh meta bits good thing you remember.

524
00:36:02,483 --> 00:36:10,686
Rym: Yep, first off Welcome to all of our new listeners who are finally Coming out of their lurking depths because we can see your IP addresses and joining the forums.

526
00:36:16,946 --> 00:36:25,529
Rym: We have said that before and For those of you who've been paying attention for quite some time now We've been having our logo contest for GeekNights because we don't have a good logo.

527
00:36:26,931 --> 00:36:28,277
Rym: We have a deadline now.

Scott: Well, no fortune just just fame and $50.

532
00:36:44,752 --> 00:36:46,035
Rym: That's a fortune to some people.

533
00:36:46,196 --> 00:36:47,740
Rym: All right, especially college bums.

534
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,868
Rym: Yeah, imagine back if we were at RIT and someone gave us 50 bucks.

535
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:57,335
Rym: Yep But Midnight on Sunday 1159 p.m.

536
00:36:57,657 --> 00:37:02,436
Rym: This Sunday the contest is over Over over over and done.

537
00:37:02,477 --> 00:37:03,803
Rym: You cannot enter it after that.

538
00:37:03,843 --> 00:37:05,169
Rym: I don't care how awesome it is.

539
00:37:05,911 --> 00:37:13,335
Scott: Yeah until somewhat recently we had a lot of we had we had enough submissions, but none of them really were like, okay That's the one now.

540
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:15,703
Scott: We've got some that are like, alright, we can go with that.

541
00:37:16,085 --> 00:37:17,570
Rym: Yep, and we've been sitting on them for a while.

542
00:37:17,651 --> 00:37:19,170
Rym: We just we got to pick a logo.

543
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:23,310
Rym: We got to move with this because I want to make my business cards and t-shirts and all that other good stuff.

544
00:37:23,531 --> 00:37:30,924
Rym: Yep, and once again once we have all our merch because we'll definitely have some awesome t-shirts and things I'll tell you right now that we're going to sell them at cost.

545
00:37:30,964 --> 00:37:32,109
Rym: We're not gonna make money off of them?

546
00:37:32,571 --> 00:37:34,016
Scott: Yeah, no, at least not for now.

547
00:37:34,237 --> 00:37:34,698
Rym: Not not.

548
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:37,206
Rym: if we ever do start making money off and we'll tell you.

549
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:41,184
Rym: but right now We're more interested in getting cool stuff to people than we are in making money.

550
00:37:41,887 --> 00:37:42,430
Scott: That is true.

551
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:45,535
Scott: What are the meta bits do we have?

552
00:37:46,379 --> 00:37:46,820
Rym: not so much.

553
00:37:46,881 --> 00:37:48,788
Rym: people are joining the forums like we told them to yep.

554
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,296
Scott: Visit the website Recruit.com.

555
00:37:52,678 --> 00:37:59,378
Rym: Yep Libsyn informed me that we had our 10,000 unique IP hit in Some amount of time.

556
00:37:59,398 --> 00:38:01,329
Rym: I don't know what the crap was about that.

557
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:07,610
Scott: So there are theoretically 10,000 people in the world that have heard at least one of ours or downloaded at least one of our shows.

558
00:38:07,751 --> 00:38:11,546
Scott: But who knows how many people have used like 10 IP addresses each?

559
00:38:11,887 --> 00:38:18,409
Rym: Yeah, so It's weird looking at the stats for episodes because we still we have a lot of listeners.

560
00:38:18,449 --> 00:38:26,169
Rym: now We're starting to have enough people to where the data we get from the site actually is useful Like we can spot trends now that aren't just aberrations.

561
00:38:26,912 --> 00:38:32,170
Rym: It's just still weird how some episodes get downloaded like a lot more than others, but it's not a pattern.

562
00:38:32,491 --> 00:38:36,610
Scott: Yeah, we can't seem like if an episode is downloaded a hundred more times than another episode.

563
00:38:36,952 --> 00:38:40,428
Scott: I try to find maybe a popular site linking to it and I never do.

564
00:38:41,633 --> 00:38:43,447
Scott: There's no rhyme or reason to it Yeah.

565
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:48,490
Rym: But yet we noticed like one time someone must have submitted us to fart because we got a bunch of hits from total fart.

566
00:38:48,811 --> 00:38:54,428
Scott: Yep, but one of our I think whatever most popular episode was the favorite video games episode.

567
00:38:54,528 --> 00:38:55,170
Scott: What's all that?

568
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:59,023
Rym: Yep, and actually of toys of our youth was real huge.

569
00:38:59,143 --> 00:39:00,970
Scott: Yeah, that's another very popular episode.

570
00:39:01,332 --> 00:39:08,340
Rym: interestingly enough the way I can we can usually tell if an episode was Popular for its subject matter as opposed to for some other.

571
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:16,970
Rym: weird reason was that every time an episode gets a whole bunch of crazy Downloads, it's almost always people clicking on the link on the web page and not using the feed or iTunes or anything.

572
00:39:17,311 --> 00:39:22,145
Rym: Yep, and on that note tomorrow Wednesday being anime manga comics day.

573
00:39:22,587 --> 00:39:23,730
Rym: We went to another convention.

574
00:39:24,192 --> 00:39:27,268
Rym: We didn't talk so much about going to this one as we have about other ones.

575
00:39:27,791 --> 00:39:31,024
Rym: No, but we will have our full coverage of Wizard World Philly.

576
00:39:31,486 --> 00:39:31,767
Scott: Yep.

577
00:39:31,847 --> 00:39:32,430
Scott: That is correct.

578
00:39:32,811 --> 00:39:36,883
Rym: I got some interviews in the spirit of the anime world order guys.

579
00:39:37,204 --> 00:39:40,789
Rym: I did my own little search for the truth comic search for the truth.

580
00:39:41,331 --> 00:39:48,575
Rym: I discovered a truth about comic fans as opposed to anime fans and how there are two very distinct geekeries Mm-hmm.

581
00:39:49,058 --> 00:39:55,686
Rym: And while there are a lot of Anime fans who like comics there aren't so many comic fans who like anime.

582
00:39:56,248 --> 00:39:56,890
Scott: That is true.

583
00:39:57,492 --> 00:40:04,691
