1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,610
Rym: It's Monday August 14th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,131 --> 00:00:14,957
Rym: tonight after an almost two-week hiatus.

3
00:00:14,997 --> 00:00:17,760
Rym: We bring you our live podcasting panel from Otakon.

4
00:00:20,162 --> 00:00:21,197
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:22,144 --> 00:00:25,199
Rym: Well after almost two weeks of hiatus GeekNights is back.

6
00:00:25,983 --> 00:00:33,710
Rym: Beware we live we hunger Run coward run run run see.

7
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,820
Rym: I thought about putting the actual wav files in but that was so much more fun.

8
00:00:37,101 --> 00:00:41,375
Rym: Yeah, I guess you can put them in near the end of the episode for funnies or randomly throughout.

9
00:00:41,756 --> 00:00:49,039
Rym: ooh also funnies But anyway for anyone who isn't aware Meaning mostly people who may be new listeners since we seem to have a lot of you.

10
00:00:49,702 --> 00:00:57,480
Rym: We were at Otakon and Wildwood and Atlantic City and Beacon for the last two weeks pretty much collecting content for podcasting.

11
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:03,138
Rym: We have enough content to do the next three weeks handily.

12
00:01:03,158 --> 00:01:06,140
Rym: at this point I'd say we have enough content to the next three months.

13
00:01:08,086 --> 00:01:12,360
Rym: Now instead of doing one or two massive massive episodes are going really long all week.

14
00:01:13,042 --> 00:01:13,163
Rym: The

15
00:01:13,203 --> 00:01:19,314
Rym: plan is that we are just going to use all of these stories from Otakon and the week of awesome Throughout the next several weeks as we

16
00:01:19,355 --> 00:01:19,677
Rym: see fit

17
00:01:21,021 --> 00:01:27,460
Rym: Which means you are in store for many many entertaining episodes of GeekNights instead of one incredibly stupid long one

18
00:01:27,842 --> 00:01:36,320
Rym: Now for all of you who are looking for our Otakon coverage or all of that business We are going to have our main Otakon con report this Wednesday on anime manga comics day.

19
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:40,013
Rym: Tomorrow we're gonna talk about just the gaming that

20
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,440
Scott: we did over the past two weeks

21
00:01:41,741 --> 00:01:42,323
Rym: I think right

22
00:01:42,444 --> 00:01:51,080
Rym: which was mostly the gaming room at the con that we did check out and play a bunch of games in and Then playing DDR for pretty much three days non-stop in Wildwood.

23
00:01:51,582 --> 00:01:54,073
Rym: We also played some D&D for a bit.

24
00:01:54,454 --> 00:01:55,820
Rym: sure we did a bit, but we fell asleep.

25
00:01:56,901 --> 00:01:58,606
Rym: It's right about halfway through the one shot.

26
00:01:58,847 --> 00:02:01,615
Rym: yeah right after we fought and failed to kill that dragon.

27
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:02,597
Rym: good job.

28
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:06,718
Rym: Thursday We will reveal the new motto of the front row crew.

29
00:02:06,858 --> 00:02:13,460
Rym: yes We will have to give mad props to the two people who are somewhat together responsible for the new motto the front row crew.

30
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,670
Rym: But suffice to say we enacted the motto to its fullest.

31
00:02:16,811 --> 00:02:25,530
Rym: we have done not one not one, but two Um Dumb things that are going to be all over the internet.

32
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,492
Rym: I guarantee it.

33
00:02:26,974 --> 00:02:34,260
Rym: Hopefully we can use the Incredible internet popularity of the dumb things we have done to bring in new listeners.

34
00:02:34,542 --> 00:02:36,050
Rym: I mean honestly we did these things.

35
00:02:36,292 --> 00:02:37,780
Rym: just they're the kind of things we would do anyway.

36
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,210
Rym: We found them hilarious, but then afterward we realized that they're exactly the things we always see on Boing.

37
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:53,738
Rym: Boing Yeah I mean the other day I was going around the internet, and I saw a link to a blog story about leet license plates.

38
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:55,708
Rym: hello I have a leet license plate.

39
00:02:55,748 --> 00:02:59,187
Rym: you have the most basic leet license And why wasn't I on there?

40
00:02:59,267 --> 00:03:01,679
Rym: what the hell you're also in one of the most populous states.

41
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,955
Rym: Yeah, the fact that no one got that before you I guess.

42
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,100
Rym: oh well I was neglected.

43
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:13,318
Rym: But we will generate two awesomes to counteract my lack of leet license plate.

44
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:24,880
Rym: knowing Now if you notice that I particularly sound a lot different than usual one We completely lost our voices at Otakon as in Scott, and I could not talk at all.

45
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:27,306
Rym: Now you're going today.

46
00:03:27,326 --> 00:03:32,486
Rym: what we have for you is actually a recording of our Otakon panel Which was Sunday morning.

47
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,900
Rym: now we lost our voices sometime around the middle of Saturday.

48
00:03:35,944 --> 00:03:45,871
Rym: Yes We drugged ourselves with the halls and menthol in order to actually do the show and it was painful as in the moment the panel Was over I couldn't talk at all anymore.

49
00:03:46,032 --> 00:03:55,517
Rym: Yes, so thanks to the halls of medicine We did our panel and thus destroyed our throats and vocal cords Which is part of the reason why the panel is going to sound bad now?

50
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,238
Rym: Additionally we'll talk about the rest of the problems with the panel recording when we actually play it.

51
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:11,422
Rym: yeah Yeah, additionally you might notice that I sound different because my pop filter Which I brought to Otakon to show to all of the other podcasts is nice homemade Embroidery loop.

52
00:04:11,983 --> 00:04:16,094
Rym: yes the one that was featured on the creative mom podcast the same.

53
00:04:16,615 --> 00:04:18,519
Rym: it has been lost somewhere.

54
00:04:18,861 --> 00:04:24,460
Rym: Therefore I'm currently angling the microphone oddly in order to minimize the popping that I normally make.

55
00:04:25,382 --> 00:04:25,823
Rym: Good job.

56
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:30,019
Rym: Yeah, so I'm gonna have to stop somewhere and buy a new pop filter sometime soon.

57
00:04:31,081 --> 00:04:40,248
Rym: Yeah, we'll probably buy those new microphones that the audio guy at Otakon told us to get and then we'll buy pop filters for them Yes, or buy more embroidery loops.

58
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:43,380
Rym: also the fact that the audio guy at Otakon laughed at our mixer.

59
00:04:43,521 --> 00:04:44,673
Rym: We're going to upgrade the mixer.

60
00:04:44,976 --> 00:04:50,865
Rym: Yeah Yeah, especially since there's nothing really wrong with the mixer itself except It doesn't have enough holes.

61
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:53,355
Rym: we used all of them at Otakon.

62
00:04:53,657 --> 00:04:57,720
Rym: yep in fact We recorded a whole bunch of awesome interviews that are going to be played all week.

63
00:04:58,163 --> 00:05:01,363
Rym: We also survived an assassination attempt Which will be.

64
00:05:01,825 --> 00:05:05,120
Rym: we actually have audio of that which will be played at some point in the next two weeks.

65
00:05:05,382 --> 00:05:07,036
Rym: Yeah, probably a week from Wednesday.

66
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,551
Rym: I'm guessing Fucking clown pistols.

67
00:05:09,773 --> 00:05:12,303
Rym: Oh my god All right.

68
00:05:12,925 --> 00:05:13,145
Rym: All right.

69
00:05:13,206 --> 00:05:16,597
Rym: Anyway to not go too on about all of our crazy stuff.

70
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:17,520
Rym: That'll come during the week.

71
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:18,859
Rym: We have the news as usual.

72
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:23,760
Rym: Wow, there was a lot of news in the past two weeks that we didn't talk about at all.

73
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,342
Rym: And you know what?

74
00:05:24,764 --> 00:05:29,440
Rym: I didn't even bother to go back on dig to see every news story of the past two weeks.

75
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,536
Rym: Yeah, I basically just picked out the one that kind of stood out in my head.

76
00:05:32,737 --> 00:05:33,682
Rym: and yeah This is.

77
00:05:33,722 --> 00:05:39,210
Rym: this is the time when podcasts like twit come in handy, you know, cuz they're weekly They just summarize the whole week.

78
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:45,097
Rym: So listening to two twits today I was completely caught up even though that's what all of you seem to want us to turn GeekNights into.

79
00:05:45,117 --> 00:05:46,343
Rym: yeah It's like what.

80
00:05:46,484 --> 00:05:49,500
Rym: if you want to listen to it, seriously, just listen it to it.

81
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,759
Rym: I do note that most of the people who suggest that said that they like us more than they like to it.

82
00:05:54,382 --> 00:05:59,320
Rym: Some of the people yeah, but how come twit has a whole jillion listeners and we don't ah, we'll get on that.

83
00:05:59,621 --> 00:06:00,544
Rym: Yeah, all right.

84
00:06:00,584 --> 00:06:04,277
Rym: So mine's real simple because I don't think I need to do much commentary on this.

85
00:06:04,317 --> 00:06:07,916
Rym: This is pretty Obvious now self-explanatory.

86
00:06:08,057 --> 00:06:12,998
Rym: Sony Kinda sucks and blu-ray has pretty much been a train wreck from the start.

87
00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:21,042
Rym: now recently the blu-ray drives the first of the blu-ray drives have come out and Alright cool.

88
00:06:21,985 --> 00:06:38,778
Rym: It came to the attention of the internet that these drives cannot actually play commercially released blu-ray discs due to problems with the copyright and DRM stuff and as well due to problems with the software and The fact that HDCP does not really work on computers.

89
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:38,979
Rym: yet.

90
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:52,500
Rym: Basically the way it is you buy a blu-ray drive for your computer because you want to burn blu-ray discs play Blu-ray movies on your computer something whatever you want to do store data on them because they're marginally larger.

91
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,432
Rym: Maybe you have a blu-ray disc and you want to play.

92
00:06:55,894 --> 00:06:57,180
Rym: you want to get data off of it.

93
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,939
Rym: It's a data blu-ray disc and put it on your computer except no one has those.

94
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:04,511
Rym: yet The only blu-ray discs are commercially released movies that don't work.

95
00:07:04,652 --> 00:07:07,040
Rym: on the only drives that exist right now.

96
00:07:07,523 --> 00:07:20,980
Rym: The drive can play the movies But what it does is it requires that you have this DRM called HDCP which is high definition content protection in your video card and I think even in your monitor, right?

97
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:29,880
Rym: Yes now to the best of my knowledge unless something's changed or I haven't googled around too closely There don't appear to be any video cards that have HDCP support.

98
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:36,380
Rym: There were many that said they had HDCP support over HDCP ready, but none of them actually were.

99
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:42,499
Rym: Yeah, so if you want a blu-ray drive don't buy one they don't work.

100
00:07:43,424 --> 00:07:54,040
Rym: Well, you can buy one as long as you know that in the future You're going to have to buy a new video card that has this DRM in it and a new monitor that has this DRM in it.

101
00:07:54,683 --> 00:08:02,600
Rym: If that even comes to pass or if they don't change HDCP or if they don't just completely redo the format or all the other possible problems.

102
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:16,760
Rym: Yeah it's like you need to have a video card that has DRM a monitor that has DRM a special cable and then This blu-ray drive and some of those things exist and some of those things don't or at least they're not all commercially available.

103
00:08:17,641 --> 00:08:24,660
Rym: therefore it Effectively the D hit the blu-ray drive for your computer cannot play blu-ray movies.

104
00:08:25,462 --> 00:08:28,040
Rym: So I hate to be the Deadpool dead horse, and I'm not gonna go.

105
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,900
Rym: I'm really not gonna talk about blu-ray again because there's.

106
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:33,323
Rym: It's kind of like Jack Thompson.

107
00:08:33,344 --> 00:08:38,078
Rym: Yeah, I only talk about blu-ray or Jack Thompson if they top themselves somehow.

108
00:08:38,803 --> 00:08:41,597
Rym: And so a lot of Jack Thompson lately, but it's nothing out of the ordinary.

109
00:08:41,616 --> 00:08:42,200
Rym: It's nothing new.

110
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,768
Rym: He's just been in the news more.

111
00:08:43,928 --> 00:08:44,250
Rym: Yeah.

112
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:44,471
Rym: Yes.

113
00:08:44,531 --> 00:08:48,899
Rym: I mean he would have to pretty much kill a baby For me to talk about him, didn't he?

114
00:08:51,184 --> 00:08:53,700
Rym: Yeah, but I I'm very much.

115
00:08:53,820 --> 00:09:01,298
Rym: I'm pretty much 90% certain that blu-ray as a format is going to fail and That I was about 80% certain until this news came out.

116
00:09:01,681 --> 00:09:04,294
Rym: So we'll see if anything can make that percentage ever go down again.

117
00:09:04,937 --> 00:09:06,745
Rym: We'll see All right.

118
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:10,766
Rym: So also in the news What was my news again?

119
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:11,710
Rym: Good job.

120
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:12,433
Rym: Good.

121
00:09:12,473 --> 00:09:14,200
Rym: You finally get back after two weeks.

122
00:09:14,662 --> 00:09:17,537
Rym: I just reminded myself like two minutes ago of what it was.

123
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,085
Rym: Oh Right the RAA.

124
00:09:20,587 --> 00:09:21,790
Rym: Oh they exist.

125
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,619
Rym: Yeah, they're still around doing stupid shit and they're suing people as always.

126
00:09:26,502 --> 00:09:31,435
Rym: So they sued this guy and while they were suing this guy he died.

127
00:09:31,756 --> 00:09:33,300
Rym: He suddenly died of an aneurysm.

128
00:09:33,622 --> 00:09:38,031
Rym: Yep, so they said ah shit How are we gonna sue a dead man?

129
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:40,080
Rym: You know what they're going to sue a dead man.

130
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:52,299
Rym: They're continuing with the lawsuit and they're forcing the family He bereaved family including the man's children to submit deposition so that they can that they can then prosecute and then Extract money from his estate.

131
00:09:53,262 --> 00:09:56,160
Rym: Yep, so they basically said alright the guy died.

132
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:59,876
Rym: We'll give you 60 days to mourn on the 61st day.

133
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:04,119
Rym: We want you to come in and give deposition so that we can take his money.

134
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,378
Rym: um, I don't know what to say to that.

135
00:10:07,418 --> 00:10:10,940
Rym: that's That's the worst PR move in the world.

136
00:10:11,302 --> 00:10:19,937
Rym: I mean they've already sued old ladies young kids single moms College students and now they're suing a dead man and they're making his children testify against it.

137
00:10:19,957 --> 00:10:20,840
Rym: Well, I mean think about this.

138
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,794
Rym: Let's say you had a legitimate lawsuit against someone like a really legitimate one.

139
00:10:24,934 --> 00:10:27,603
Rym: say, I don't know What's something you would see.

140
00:10:27,643 --> 00:10:32,700
Rym: you stole a million dollars from me straight up by violating a contract and then you died.

141
00:10:33,161 --> 00:10:33,663
Rym: There you go.

142
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,147
Rym: I should be able to get that money back.

143
00:10:35,307 --> 00:10:44,080
Rym: You should but sometimes, you know, if it's not a big deal Even though you have a legitimate case, you'll let it go because the guy died.

144
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:47,935
Rym: Yeah, I mean the RIAA obviously is not suing people to get money.

145
00:10:48,035 --> 00:10:49,340
Rym: getting money is just a byproduct.

146
00:10:49,701 --> 00:10:58,188
Rym: They're suing people in order to scare people into not downloading things which isn't working at all - they've never actually won a lawsuit.

147
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,459
Rym: They just get people to settle and everyone who's ever fought them has won.

148
00:11:01,479 --> 00:11:06,580
Rym: and Three they're not going to scare any more people by continuing to sue this dead daddy.

149
00:11:07,144 --> 00:11:09,479
Rym: All they're going to do is piss more people off.

150
00:11:10,122 --> 00:11:19,657
Rym: all I can hope is that because of the attention brought to this case of Where the guy died that some of those lawyers who won cases for other people will go help.

151
00:11:19,698 --> 00:11:23,419
Rym: these people Prevent the RIAA from taking money from the estate.

152
00:11:24,681 --> 00:11:30,680
Rym: Because I'm thinking what the RIAA is thinking is that hey look there's an estate and no one to defend it.

153
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:35,540
Rym: Maybe we can loot it and they won't feel bad because they're looting a dead man who isn't there to care.

154
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,747
Rym: I don't think they're thinking that at all.

155
00:11:36,828 --> 00:11:46,441
Rym: I think very simply they'll just sue anyone They have a case against I don't know and then if the person fights back They'll probably just immediately drop the suit as they tend to do Whatever.

156
00:11:46,823 --> 00:11:47,445
Rym: They're evil.

157
00:11:47,586 --> 00:11:49,332
Rym: They're more evil every day.

158
00:11:49,353 --> 00:11:51,320
Rym: They haven't let up, you know.

159
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,638
Rym: Wow, so the news today was Sony is incompetent and the RIAA is evil.

160
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,982
Rym: Seems like nothing much changed while we were away for two weeks.

161
00:12:00,062 --> 00:12:00,803
Rym: Fantastic.

162
00:12:07,568 --> 00:12:08,969
Rym: Things of the past two weeks.

163
00:12:09,349 --> 00:12:12,870
Rym: Things of the day Alright for all of our new listeners.

164
00:12:13,613 --> 00:12:24,710
Rym: We're not gonna annoy all of our current listeners as we have in the past when we get a bunch of new listeners by explaining The entire show every day for an entire week, but I think it warrants explanation that what we're about to do is something we do.

165
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:30,647
Rym: it's a bit on every show where we Show you and then talk about whatever thing we found on the internet in the last 24 hours.

166
00:12:31,371 --> 00:12:34,309
Rym: That was awesome enough to share with anyone on the internet.

167
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,677
Rym: It's probably something you've already seen.

168
00:12:36,717 --> 00:12:40,550
Rym: if you're the type of person who reads lots of websites like dig and slash

169
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:47,850
Rym: Many of our listeners do not do these things and they're often new and sometimes our listeners send us things that we have not seen

170
00:12:48,492 --> 00:12:49,154
Rym: Very rarely

171
00:12:49,476 --> 00:12:51,302
Rym: maybe once or twice ever though actually

172
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:52,266
Rym: over

173
00:12:52,326 --> 00:13:03,232
Rym: the week of awesome Which actually we'll talk about in great detail on Thursday because that's where all the hijinks took place Our friend showed us a good number of things that we had missed over the course of the internet that we are now going to Share.

174
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:13,270
Rym: yep, and you know sometimes, you know I think the real point of the thing of the day is that We're gonna tell you about cool things on the internet that you'll probably find out about in a couple weeks.

175
00:13:13,651 --> 00:13:20,718
Rym: But since you find out about them now you kind of keep pace with us a little bit plus You know you get all of our witty commentary.

176
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:22,686
Rym: Yeah, it's really all about the witty commentary.

177
00:13:22,947 --> 00:13:25,339
Rym: So this video I forget who exactly showed it to us.

178
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:30,542
Rym: It was either Jess or Yuko, I believe I don't actually remember because I walked into the room and it was playing.

179
00:13:31,265 --> 00:13:37,690
Rym: it's called dad's home And it is this cute awesome animation kind of reminds me of the Perry Bible Fellowship.

180
00:13:38,612 --> 00:13:46,570
Rym: yeah, and it's just a father comes home and Goes on a destructive rampage, and then he saves the day by rocking out hard.

181
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:49,058
Rym: I can't describe it any other way other than that.

182
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,704
Rym: It is exactly my kind of humor.

183
00:13:50,824 --> 00:13:52,410
Rym: Wow that was some witty commentary.

184
00:13:52,793 --> 00:13:58,002
Rym: It's so worth listening to this show Because they couldn't figure that out just by watching it.

185
00:13:58,624 --> 00:14:10,369
Rym: well the thing is it's it's that humor That's kind of offbeat and hard to follow like the guy's head catches on fire randomly and then self referentially and then he gets isolated laser eyes for no reason.

186
00:14:11,672 --> 00:14:14,650
Rym: So one if you're a fan of the Perry Bible Fellowship watch this video.

187
00:14:15,252 --> 00:14:17,640
Rym: If you're not a fan of Perry Bible Fellowship go read it.

188
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,750
Rym: if you like this video go read the Perry Bible Fellowship.

189
00:14:20,851 --> 00:14:27,669
Rym: Go read the Perry Bible Fellowship No matter what if you can read the English language even if you can't read the English language.

190
00:14:28,311 --> 00:14:38,627
Rym: Though on a completely side note that I'll talk about again whenever we do playback the our webcomic roundtable that we did at Otakon I might have added a new webcomic to my list of webcomics.

191
00:14:39,109 --> 00:14:40,938
Rym: Oh Yeah, cuz I've known.

192
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,950
Rym: you know I've met Michael Mookie.

193
00:14:43,691 --> 00:14:44,113
Rym: I don't know.

194
00:14:44,153 --> 00:14:51,454
Rym: actually I'd never known his last name until just now when I'm looking at the book in front of me, but Dominic Deegan Oracle for Hire I'd never read.

195
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,523
Rym: I just kind of knew the guy who wrote it.

196
00:14:53,644 --> 00:15:01,884
Rym: as in I ran into my cons all the time And you go gave me the book of the first I guess season of his webcomic, and I think for the first time since dr.

197
00:15:01,924 --> 00:15:02,366
Rym: McNinja.

198
00:15:02,426 --> 00:15:03,609
Rym: I'm going to read a new webcomic.

199
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:07,318
Rym: Only thought of that because of Perry Bible Fellowship.

200
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,869
Rym: I think it's a good enough time to say mad props to the dr.

201
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,544
Rym: McNinja cosplayer at Otakon.

202
00:15:11,725 --> 00:15:16,668
Rym: Oh, yes I think I was the only one who recognized his costume because I walked out to him like are you dr.

203
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:20,890
Rym: McNinja, and he was like oh, yeah, and we shook hands, and he was all good time.

204
00:15:21,051 --> 00:15:23,102
Rym: He reacted exactly the way he should have.

205
00:15:23,303 --> 00:15:25,556
Rym: there was a picture of him in my flicker So you go check that out.

206
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:26,462
Rym: definitely good in fact.

207
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:33,230
Rym: go check out the flicker And you might be able to surmise Some of the things that have gone on that we were going to be talking about over the next two weeks.

208
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:38,670
Rym: You'll probably be able to surmise more from our friends flickers than from ours because I don't take very many pictures.

209
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:47,580
Rym: Yeah though all of you who are savvy to the forums will probably easily find the other flicker that has the pictures of us doing the Dumb things we did last week.

210
00:15:47,801 --> 00:15:54,850
Rym: Yeah, the things we will talk about Thursday All right my thing of the day is I'm sure everyone has seen this by now because it's at the top of YouTube.

211
00:15:56,391 --> 00:16:04,283
Rym: It's an old man on YouTube like a 79 year old man, and he's from Britain Which is awesome because that means he talks in a cool way.

212
00:16:04,303 --> 00:16:05,832
Rym: is he actually 79 Or did you?

213
00:16:05,872 --> 00:16:07,738
Rym: he really is like 79 years old.

214
00:16:07,778 --> 00:16:09,925
Rym: you keep saying like is he or is he not 79 79 years old, okay?

215
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:29,444
Rym: And because you said like 79 lies in he's like 80 or he's like 90, but the fact that you used 79 specifically 79 years old okay I think what the deal was is YouTube profile says 78, but in one of the videos He says 79. so he must have joined YouTube before his birthday.

216
00:16:29,584 --> 00:16:30,468
Rym: damn you internet.

217
00:16:30,648 --> 00:16:40,109
Rym: Yeah Anyway this old guy apparently he used to be a biker but not he doesn't have tattoos or anything and he used to be pretty hardcore.

218
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:59,190
Rym: and now he's an old man in Britain and he likes blues music which is awesome because I like blues music and he likes YouTube and he's one of the few old people who actually knows enough to Go on YouTube and look at stuff, and he thinks it's really cool that all the cool videos that young people are making.

219
00:17:00,055 --> 00:17:16,069
Rym: So he decided that he would try to make a YouTube video and he pretty much set up a webcam and he played some blues music and He talked about being an old cranky guy And he figures he'll impart some of his old man wisdom onto the YouTube kids out there.

220
00:17:16,431 --> 00:17:22,628
Rym: I have so much respect for this man, and he succeeds in becoming the most popular thing on YouTube.

221
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:27,219
Rym: I mean 79. think about how old that is.

222
00:17:27,661 --> 00:17:35,130
Rym: think about how different the world was when he was a punk kid and Now he's managed to get on YouTube and become stupid pop.

223
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:38,627
Rym: I mean, I know a lot of people my age who couldn't get on YouTube.

224
00:17:38,889 --> 00:17:39,029
Scott: yep

225
00:17:39,473 --> 00:17:57,937
Rym: So I've linked you to his first video Which is called first try and there's a lot of comments and a lot of there even videos people have put up in response To this video, but he also if you go to the guy's YouTube page Which I can't seem to find because I don't know how to use YouTube There is you can see all the videos.

226
00:17:57,978 --> 00:17:58,519
Rym: He's made.

227
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,226
Rym: He's got like episodes going on.

228
00:18:00,386 --> 00:18:02,955
Rym: It's sort of like a. It's more like a vlog.

229
00:18:03,396 --> 00:18:04,800
Rym: you know a vlog.

230
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,502
Rym: I like that.

231
00:18:05,582 --> 00:18:06,304
Rym: It's a vlog.

232
00:18:06,425 --> 00:18:11,742
Rym: That's a terrible word that should never be you I know, but that's the most accurate word for what this old man is making.

233
00:18:11,843 --> 00:18:15,718
Rym: you know what you're allowed to say vlog because I've Said blog o sphere more than once

234
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,401
Rym: all right,

235
00:18:16,522 --> 00:18:17,727
Rym: and I said pot is fear once -

236
00:18:17,747 --> 00:18:17,968
Scott: yeah

237
00:18:18,571 --> 00:18:27,730
Rym: I normally wouldn't say vlog for something like ask a ninja or whatever But this is a vlog an awesome old man vlog that is deservedly at the top of YouTube.

238
00:18:28,573 --> 00:18:33,130
Rym: All right now before we go into the podcasting panel at Otakon first off a bunch of meta bits.

239
00:18:33,632 --> 00:18:38,390
Rym: Stay tuned once again all this week for all of our Otakon and Wildwood and Atlantic City coverage.

240
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:41,383
Rym: We have so many funny stories to tell.

241
00:18:41,403 --> 00:18:44,677
Rym: you have no idea Not a single idea.

242
00:18:44,738 --> 00:18:47,570
Rym: unless you were with us, then you already know all these stories.

243
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:48,876
Rym: We did some dangerous things.

244
00:18:49,218 --> 00:18:51,890
Rym: we gambled and won a decent sum of money.

245
00:18:52,311 --> 00:18:53,054
Rym: Don't give it away.

246
00:18:53,074 --> 00:18:54,861
Rym: Yeah, that wasn't giving anything away.

247
00:18:54,881 --> 00:18:55,765
Rym: I was giving something away.

248
00:18:55,865 --> 00:18:56,950
Rym: It was giving a tiny bit away.

249
00:18:57,793 --> 00:19:00,595
Rym: someone ate something Not someone else.

250
00:19:00,615 --> 00:19:01,781
Rym: the kind of stuff you got to give away.

251
00:19:01,821 --> 00:19:03,409
Rym: someone had something made.

252
00:19:04,912 --> 00:19:05,958
Rym: People bought things.

253
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,306
Rym: yes people bought things.

254
00:19:07,387 --> 00:19:10,138
Rym: indeed People did not buy things.

255
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:13,370
Rym: um some things that were bought involved eyeballs and robots.

256
00:19:14,671 --> 00:19:18,370
Rym: People engaged in activities and said things which were humorous.

257
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,914
Rym: There is a thing that exists.

258
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:25,670
Rym: it is called a clown pistol, and it is weighed heavily on my mind all right, okay?

259
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:27,233
Rym: Now the panel.

260
00:19:27,895 --> 00:19:32,930
Rym: we were asked to do a poll actually we asked to do and then Otakon said this is a great idea.

261
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:41,378
Rym: Please do it a panel on podcasting as in how to listen to podcast what they are how to do them And all that sort of thing at Otakon this year,

262
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:48,150
Rym: and it was scheduled for Sunday morning, which means Everyone is checking out at their hotels and isn't going to come to your panel.

263
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,505
Rym: But regardless of that like a good number of people showed up.

264
00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:54,075
Rym: Yeah, it was also Interestingly enough scheduled.

265
00:19:54,195 --> 00:20:01,222
Rym: I mean there are four panel rooms at Otakon this year two of which are the standard panel rooms one of which is like the tiny panel room.

266
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:05,677
Rym: they give to unpopular things and They put us in the panel room.

267
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,563
Rym: that was pretty much massive.

268
00:20:07,743 --> 00:20:09,008
Rym: I would use the word ginormous.

269
00:20:09,048 --> 00:20:16,790
Rym: Yes this year They've destroyed main events They what used to be main events which is this tremendous ballroom on the top floor of the Convention Center.

270
00:20:17,452 --> 00:20:28,745
Rym: They removed that entirely because the only reason they had main events was for the cosplay and they didn't really Anything else they used it for did not use even half the space of main events now.

271
00:20:28,825 --> 00:20:30,470
Rym: This may not happen next year.

272
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,276
Rym: Yeah, we don't know.

273
00:20:31,336 --> 00:20:31,739
Rym: next year.

274
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,170
Rym: We will have much to say about.

275
00:20:34,157 --> 00:20:38,918
Rym: Yes And on Wednesday we give our general con report.

276
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:44,080
Rym: so because they move main events to the arena down the street They split.

277
00:20:44,181 --> 00:20:44,929
Rym: they split up.

278
00:20:45,513 --> 00:20:47,529
Rym: They moved the cosplay to the arena down the street.

279
00:20:48,071 --> 00:20:55,939
Rym: Main events was split up and they cut it in half and one half of it was theater is now theater one Which is a showing theater for movies and stuff.

280
00:20:56,581 --> 00:20:58,829
Rym: The other half was split in half yet again.

281
00:20:59,652 --> 00:21:01,919
Rym: One of those quarters I think was a video room.

282
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:06,272
Rym: Yeah, it was like video seven or something or video six I don't remember.

283
00:21:06,312 --> 00:21:06,914
Scott: I don't remember.

284
00:21:07,415 --> 00:21:12,430
Rym: but the other quarter so a former quarter of main events became panel four.

285
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:13,614
Rym: Now us.

286
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,644
Rym: there was a massive sound system in there to the point.

287
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:19,448
Rym: now some of its cut out But you can still hear the echo.

288
00:21:20,091 --> 00:21:26,750
Rym: We were on stage with the microphones and it was so loud and echoey that it sounded fine in the place for the audience.

289
00:21:27,312 --> 00:21:32,969
Rym: But because we were on stage we could not actually hear what anyone in the audience was saying to us.

290
00:21:33,451 --> 00:21:38,950
Rym: Yep, so eventually at some point in the podcast we get off the stage and then we can hear people.

291
00:21:39,171 --> 00:21:40,663
Rym: Yes, now there is a feedback.

292
00:21:40,784 --> 00:21:46,106
Rym: at one point I forget who walked in front of the speaker, but he walked in front of the speaker.

293
00:21:46,387 --> 00:21:48,617
Rym: whoever they are They are a fan boy or girl.

294
00:21:48,738 --> 00:21:49,642
Rym: if I listen to it.

295
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:51,130
Rym: I could probably figure out who it was.

296
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,777
Rym: I don't remember now.

297
00:21:52,817 --> 00:21:56,070
Rym: The other part of this is that the audio equipment was very expensive and fancy.

298
00:21:56,634 --> 00:21:58,569
Rym: It was also old and broken.

299
00:21:59,012 --> 00:22:07,686
Rym: So as a result the raw recording of the panel, which sounded really good Otherwise because they used really good microphones and everything was top-notch has this.

300
00:22:10,971 --> 00:22:28,883
Rym: Yeah, basically what happened is there was already existing awesome audio equipment in the panel more than we will ever need for GeekNights and we asked the guy the audio engineer in charge of the room if we could have a cable that would you know we could plug into our Mac and our mixer and record from it and he did.

301
00:22:28,963 --> 00:22:37,330
Rym: he gave us a cable but the cable went And there's really nothing to do about it and it was pretty low and it was pretty consistent.

302
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:39,510
Rym: So whatever we decided to record anyway.

303
00:22:40,671 --> 00:22:47,910
Rym: Now the choices in terms of playing this panel back for you were either one leave that noise in which was not what you want.

304
00:22:48,311 --> 00:22:53,410
Rym: No, I tried to listen to it with that noise and it is painful wicked painful.

305
00:22:53,832 --> 00:23:06,693
Rym: Now the other option was to do a simple noise gate wherein I cut out these Whenever no one's talking, but that means that you hear it whenever we talk and it made me sound weird Not good.

306
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:17,127
Rym: the third option which we went with was to basically use the audacity noise reduction thing because while I could have done It manually Scott did not want to sit there for an hour or more while I did it.

307
00:23:17,449 --> 00:23:28,773
Rym: Yep plus I've never done that on such a terrible source of noise before and I removed all of the frequencies that the Was on.

308
00:23:29,295 --> 00:23:32,946
Rym: as a result, we sound slightly like robots and we're slightly echoey.

309
00:23:33,247 --> 00:23:34,050
Rym: Well, the echoes were there.

310
00:23:34,491 --> 00:23:36,216
Rym: I know it's doubly echoey.

311
00:23:36,838 --> 00:23:41,070
Rym: Yes, and so it's it sounds a lot better than some podcasts.

312
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:41,872
Rym: I've listened to it.

313
00:23:42,273 --> 00:23:44,038
Rym: So you can't complain to me about this.

314
00:23:44,078 --> 00:23:56,478
Rym: Yes, your only other option besides a slightly robotic sounding Podcasting panel was to have no Podcasting panel and we would now be talking about something else unprepared.

315
00:23:57,022 --> 00:24:06,187
Rym: now as a result We are going to have next week on Monday a discussion on the difficulties of doing live shows as opposed to recorded shows in our studio.

316
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:16,110
Rym: There's a big difference between performing live and not performing live And there's also a big difference between performing live with your own equipment and performing live with other people's equipment.

317
00:24:17,951 --> 00:24:27,979
Rym: Also, there's a big difference between being well-rested and being hungover with a sore throat a broken voice and a bloodshot eye Two bloodshot eyes here.

318
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:29,570
Rym: Yeah, but no hangover.

319
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:34,770
Rym: So I'll warn you now we sound weird because our voices are completely gone and we've taken drugs in order to be able to speak.

320
00:24:35,771 --> 00:24:41,576
Rym: We are so tired and broken because we had to get up at 6 in the morning to prepare for this and to get out Of our hotel room.

321
00:24:41,596 --> 00:24:42,121
Rym: Mm-hmm.

322
00:24:42,363 --> 00:24:46,058
Rym: We had slept exactly 3.5 hours in the 48 hours prior to this panel.

323
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:53,682
Rym: Yeah Yes now as it despite all that I think it was a pretty good panel.

324
00:24:53,802 --> 00:24:55,610
Rym: It was definitely not our best work.

325
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:57,820
Rym: I was much happier with the podcasting panel.

326
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,286
Rym: We did at Tora con last year.

327
00:24:59,307 --> 00:25:01,316
Rym: Mm-hmm Yeah, that was definitely.

328
00:25:01,437 --> 00:25:02,462
Rym: it was more fun at least.

329
00:25:02,985 --> 00:25:13,689
Rym: Yeah, I mean, this is fun But I think if they had given us a better time like maybe like Friday late later Friday or earlier Saturday Also, if I hadn't been hungover that would have really helped.

330
00:25:14,226 --> 00:25:17,421
Rym: Yeah Then we could have had more people in there and then it would more exciting.

331
00:25:17,923 --> 00:25:29,111
Rym: now also the one thing that would be nice Is I think instead of doing an informative panel, even though everyone seemed to really like I mean We got a lot of really good questions and a lot of people tried to bother us after the show to ask us more questions Which?

332
00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:31,438
Rym: because at that point we couldn't talk anymore.

333
00:25:31,459 --> 00:25:33,204
Rym: We were unable to answer all of your questions.

334
00:25:33,826 --> 00:25:39,298
Rym: if you have questions Send us email send us an audio Audio also.

335
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:50,748
Rym: Yeah, Odeo is awesome But I think next year we're going to try to do a more less informative more fun panel as in Rym and Scott talk about something unrelated to podcasting loudly for an hour on Friday night.

336
00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:55,759
Rym: Ah Something possibly making fun of hentai And I don't want to do one of those.

337
00:25:55,779 --> 00:26:00,610
Rym: not as in we watch hentai and make fun of it But we get people to come and we make fun of them for liking hentai.

338
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,201
Rym: Mmm, I can think of something better than that.

339
00:26:04,221 --> 00:26:05,730
Rym: It's given a given a year.

340
00:26:05,871 --> 00:26:07,890
Rym: I'm guaranteed to come up with something non anti-relate.

341
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:14,710
Rym: It's got to be something that'll fit into the over 18 late-night crowd at Otakon as opposed to the hungover Sunday morning crowd.

342
00:26:15,484 --> 00:26:15,790
Rym: All right.

343
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:24,210
Rym: And Also the final bit before we play this the other things that we recorded Otakon are a whole bunch of interviews that we're going to Play all throughout the week whenever they're relevant.

344
00:26:24,872 --> 00:26:30,990
Rym: We did a webcomics roundtable with a whole bunch of webcomic artists and it turned out really well.

345
00:26:31,613 --> 00:26:34,608
Rym: all I have to do is do stuff to it and then we'll play it probably next week.

346
00:26:34,629 --> 00:26:41,649
Rym: and We recorded a short roundtable with the folks at anime world order and the folks at ninja consultant and who else was there?

347
00:26:42,713 --> 00:26:43,837
Rym: Fast karate for the gentle.

348
00:26:43,878 --> 00:26:46,990
Rym: Yes, we will be playing that probably next Wednesday.

349
00:26:47,371 --> 00:26:56,438
Rym: Yes, if you visit all of those podcasts the anime world order the ninja consultant and the fast karate for the gentleman Those are like the primary podcasters.

350
00:26:56,478 --> 00:27:04,646
Rym: We were down with at the con so their latest Episodes have stuff possibly relating to us that you might be interested in.

351
00:27:04,866 --> 00:27:08,654
Rym: Yes, and during the next week We will have stuff related to all of them Mm-hmm.

352
00:27:09,015 --> 00:27:23,034
Rym: So thus without further ado and once again, I apologize This is as good as I could make this sound the Monday after the week of awesome the podcasting and internet radio panel from Otakon 2006.

353
00:27:23,034 --> 00:27:23,177
Scott: whoo.

354
00:27:24,573 --> 00:27:26,222
Rym: Well, we've got a stellar crowd here.

355
00:27:26,262 --> 00:27:27,649
Rym: So I suppose we will just begin.

356
00:27:29,671 --> 00:27:35,048
Rym: My name is Rym, I'm Scott and we are the hosts of GeekNights the late-night podcast for geeks.

357
00:27:35,609 --> 00:27:39,287
Rym: now This is a panel not about GeekNights our podcast.

358
00:27:39,327 --> 00:27:41,256
Rym: what about Podcasting in general?

359
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:49,209
Rym: how to listen if anyone's interested how to make a podcast What this whole thing's about and then we'll probably just descend in general chaos as the panel goes on.

360
00:27:50,192 --> 00:27:51,436
Scott: So thank you all for coming.

361
00:27:51,456 --> 00:27:53,843
Scott: I know it's not easy to wake up.

362
00:27:53,943 --> 00:28:00,881
Scott: It's Sunday at 10 in the morning after Yeah after a raucous Saturday night, so thank you.

363
00:28:00,901 --> 00:28:03,890
Rym: All right, so how many of you listen to podcasts?

364
00:28:05,191 --> 00:28:07,602
Rym: All right, how many of you have never heard of a podcast?

365
00:28:07,622 --> 00:28:11,455
Rym: you just wandered into this room whoo All right.

366
00:28:11,697 --> 00:28:13,170
Rym: Do any of you actually do a podcast?

367
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:14,471
Rym: Really?

368
00:28:14,531 --> 00:28:19,548
Rym: All right, we will do some shoutouts at the end to get you to pick your podcast since we got to represent here No to con.

369
00:28:20,571 --> 00:28:30,270
Rym: But for all of you who have no idea about podcasting or how to listen We'd like to go through kind of what podcasting really is and the fact that you don't need an iPod to be a part of podcasting.

370
00:28:30,731 --> 00:28:37,510
Scott: Well, technically a podcast is an RSS feed with enclosures pointing to multimedia coded files.

371
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,954
Scott: But what that means?

372
00:28:38,994 --> 00:28:44,070
Rym: that means in English if you have an mp3 player and any kind of pod catching software.

373
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:46,339
Rym: There are millions of applications out there that all do it.

374
00:28:46,499 --> 00:28:47,463
Rym: iTunes iTunes.

375
00:28:47,523 --> 00:28:49,110
Rym: Pardon me is the one most people know.

376
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,119
Scott: There's a juice receiver.

377
00:28:51,139 --> 00:28:57,290
Rym: you subscribe to a radio show online So you go to their website and subscribe and then every time they make a new episode.

378
00:28:57,651 --> 00:29:01,181
Rym: It's automatically downloaded the next time you plug in your mp3 player.

379
00:29:01,401 --> 00:29:04,510
Rym: It's automatically put on the mp3 player and then you listen to it.

380
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:07,882
Rym: It's like a radio show plus a TiVo on the internet.

381
00:29:08,505 --> 00:29:10,010
Scott: Yeah, but you don't even need an mp3 player.

382
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:18,715
Scott: I mean most people just listen on their computers with whatever Windows Media Player iTunes or whatever music player they have, you know And you don't even need.

383
00:29:18,815 --> 00:29:21,104
Scott: all you need is a computer and an internet connection.

384
00:29:21,124 --> 00:29:23,816
Scott: if you listen to us with dial-up I don't know what's up with that.

385
00:29:24,439 --> 00:29:26,390
Rym: people listen to us with dial-up in foreign countries.

386
00:29:26,451 --> 00:29:27,528
Rym: I don't know how they manage that.

387
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:32,163
Scott: Yeah, and a podcast isn't necessarily just audio even though it's usually audio.

388
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:39,850
Scott: There are plenty of video podcasts out there and Yeah, we don't make those because they're very difficult and time-consuming and bandwidth intensive.

389
00:29:40,432 --> 00:29:41,154
Rym: Yeah, though one of them.

390
00:29:41,274 --> 00:29:44,202
Rym: I mean ask a ninja is a very popular video podcasts.

391
00:29:45,065 --> 00:29:46,268
Rym: one person recognized.

392
00:29:46,348 --> 00:29:49,098
Rym: ask a ninja All right.

393
00:29:49,379 --> 00:29:50,223
Rym: I know it's Sunday morning.

394
00:29:50,243 --> 00:29:50,604
Rym: wake up.

395
00:29:51,448 --> 00:29:55,439
Rym: Give me a Leroy Jenkins.

396
00:29:58,512 --> 00:29:58,814
Rym: All right.

397
00:29:58,834 --> 00:29:59,698
Rym: All right.

398
00:30:00,081 --> 00:30:02,954
Rym: I've never had such a stellar crowd before Mm-hmm.

399
00:30:03,619 --> 00:30:09,246
Rym: I will take some questions in a minute But is anyone everyone kind of clear on how to like what podcasts are how to listen to them?

400
00:30:09,286 --> 00:30:11,532
Rym: It's just internet radio At all.

401
00:30:12,194 --> 00:30:13,858
Scott: Yeah, that's exactly what it uses.

402
00:30:13,918 --> 00:30:26,900
Scott: In fact, it's not a podcast if it doesn't use real simple syndication, you know I'll repeat because he wanted to know if the subscribing to podcast is using RSS real simple really simple syndication, which yes that's the only way.

403
00:30:26,921 --> 00:30:37,950
Scott: and Basically someone makes you know an RSS feed and in each item in the feed They put what's called an enclosure which is just a URL to an mp3 or a video file.

404
00:30:38,512 --> 00:30:54,049
Scott: and then if you use a piece of software like iTunes or juice receiver or iPod or or any of those things it recognizes the enclosure and When there's a new item in the feed and the enclosures there it automatically will get the episode for you And you can listen to it whenever you want.

405
00:30:54,532 --> 00:31:08,849
Rym: And also what a lot of people do is if they don't want to install anything on their computer or they don't have an mp3 player you can go to like Odeo or Yahoo podcasts and they have players or things built into the web browser Or you just go to a website and you can just stream the audio directly from there.

406
00:31:09,291 --> 00:31:15,050
Scott: I mean half our listeners don't even use the RSS feed or you know any of the podcasting features at all.

407
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:25,850
Scott: They just visit our website four days a week Click on a link and download an mp3 and then play in their player without using anything fancy Though more than half of our listeners use Firefox.

408
00:31:29,071 --> 00:31:31,018
Scott: Yeah, if you use Firefox, it's pretty easy.

409
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:33,687
Scott: You can subscribe to podcasts with the live bookmarks.

410
00:31:33,707 --> 00:31:34,409
Scott: It works pretty well.

411
00:31:35,388 --> 00:31:38,618
Rym: now Podcasting really I mean webcomics.

412
00:31:38,678 --> 00:31:46,009
Rym: now webcomics started out kind of this obscure thing and then they kind of ballooned and then one day they Exploded and suddenly mega Tokyo and penny arcade and all this is just huge.

413
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,489
Rym: Podcasting hasn't quite reached that point yet.

414
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:51,200
Rym: There are probably more people reading a popular webcomic.

415
00:31:51,521 --> 00:31:53,610
Rym: then listen to all the podcasts combined.

416
00:31:54,952 --> 00:31:59,477
Scott: There's some crazy popular podcasts, but they're usually Associated with big media.

417
00:31:59,577 --> 00:32:03,150
Scott: I mean you don't see big media going into the web comics industry so much.

418
00:32:03,551 --> 00:32:09,810
Scott: But there are podcasts of like major league baseball official podcasts ABC NBC CBS NPR.

419
00:32:10,091 --> 00:32:13,890
Scott: All have official podcasts, you know, and those have a whole mess of listeners.

420
00:32:14,071 --> 00:32:18,204
Scott: But those people, you know, they're only listening usually to that specific thing.

421
00:32:18,224 --> 00:32:20,170
Scott: They're not into the podcasting scene.

422
00:32:21,252 --> 00:32:27,964
Rym: But among the non huge podcast the best thing I mean you're all here at an anime concert Obviously some stretch of either nerd or geek, which is awesome.

423
00:32:28,004 --> 00:32:29,290
Rym: Those are not bad words anymore.

424
00:32:29,913 --> 00:32:33,468
Rym: There are more geekly podcast I think than there are anything else out there.

425
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,719
Rym: I mean how many video game podcasts are there?

426
00:32:35,981 --> 00:32:37,348
Scott: too many and none of them are good.

427
00:32:40,632 --> 00:32:47,510
Scott: Yet generally what happened is because early in the podcasting days The only people who knew how to use RSS and all this stuff were geeks.

428
00:32:47,831 --> 00:33:02,483
Scott: So the podcast that became the most popular and got the most attention early on were the podcast targeted towards the geek demographic podcasts like twit, I got it, you know, like a hajillion listeners and You know all the podcasts that are sort of there.

429
00:33:02,603 --> 00:33:04,270
Scott: I mean there are crazy podcasts out there.

430
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:07,744
Scott: There's one that's like about Australian real estate market and stuff.

431
00:33:08,106 --> 00:33:09,029
Scott: It gets kind of crazy.

432
00:33:09,733 --> 00:33:11,443
Rym: But you think you just made up that weird example.

433
00:33:11,483 --> 00:33:12,650
Rym: That's a big podcast.

434
00:33:13,272 --> 00:33:14,676
Scott: It is a pretty happening.

435
00:33:14,696 --> 00:33:19,430
Scott: this is a podcast about like financial aid for colleges, that's all they talk about like every week.

436
00:33:20,372 --> 00:33:20,895
Scott: It's crazy.

437
00:33:21,116 --> 00:33:24,816
Rym: And of course, I know the question burning on everyone's mind Are there anime podcasts?

438
00:33:25,298 --> 00:33:27,125
Rym: and the answer is there's an infinite number of them.

439
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:31,570
Rym: I Actually, they're here and they're supposed to be at this panel with us.

440
00:33:31,911 --> 00:33:34,378
Rym: We don't know where they went but anime world order.

441
00:33:34,418 --> 00:33:35,922
Rym: You might have seen their flyers.

442
00:33:36,263 --> 00:33:36,824
Rym: They're here.

443
00:33:37,346 --> 00:33:37,807
Rym: Are they here?

444
00:33:37,827 --> 00:33:39,317
Rym: I Didn't see them.

445
00:33:39,541 --> 00:33:40,070
Rym: I still don't see.

446
00:33:40,382 --> 00:33:43,054
Rym: Okay There's some work on.

447
00:33:43,094 --> 00:33:46,346
Rym: they were in our room last night and despite their assassination attempt.

448
00:33:46,387 --> 00:33:47,210
Rym: We were still here today.

449
00:33:47,632 --> 00:33:49,319
Scott: That's right a clown.

450
00:33:49,339 --> 00:33:50,887
Scott: We are immune to clown pistol.

451
00:33:50,907 --> 00:33:56,586
Rym: Yeah I was shot in the face with a clown pistol after Daryl Surratt screamed six-center tyrannous last night.

452
00:33:56,646 --> 00:33:59,288
Rym: Yeah, I Got a little bruise still.

453
00:34:00,432 --> 00:34:03,410
Scott: Yeah, the anime podcast pretty much fall into two categories.

454
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:06,390
Scott: There's the ones that's one fanboy going.

455
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:12,565
Scott: Yeah, my favorite anime is this and it was so great and you don't listen to those worst anime ever.

456
00:34:13,348 --> 00:34:18,505
Scott: and then there's like The three or four ones that are actually intelligent like ours.

457
00:34:21,132 --> 00:34:23,170
Rym: Ours really goes beyond an anime podcast.

458
00:34:23,291 --> 00:34:25,159
Rym: We're kind of well, we'll get it up.

459
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:27,469
Rym: you guys actually are you interested in how to like how we do this?

460
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,429
Rym: How people make podcast how this all works?

461
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,983
Rym: All right, I don't know if they picked it up but everyone yelled.

462
00:34:33,003 --> 00:34:34,089
Rym: Yeah, so we'll get right into that.

463
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:37,085
Rym: We do a show called GeekNights.

464
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:44,190
Rym: now We do it four nights a week for about an hour every night, which is crazy by most people's standards.

465
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:45,949
Scott: I mean, they're like, how do you do it?

466
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:48,569
Scott: And we're like we sit down and talk for an hour every night.

467
00:34:49,132 --> 00:34:52,130
Rym: See the thing is I mean, we're really not trying to diss anyone or anything.

468
00:34:52,150 --> 00:35:02,629
Rym: But in terms of podcasting it seems like a lot of the podcast has started early on Or I'm people who really knew a lot about what they wanted to talk about Not so much about the audio or the tech or all that stuff.

469
00:35:03,051 --> 00:35:11,622
Rym: so a lot of podcasts have a lot of good content, but they're hard to listen to either because of audio problems or Their website is difficult to use if the RSS feeds are broken.

470
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:18,010
Rym: a lot of good podcasts don't show up in iTunes Just because people don't know how to do all the stuff to make it show up in iTunes.

471
00:35:18,471 --> 00:35:23,590
Scott: Yeah, there's some podcasts that I honestly want to listen to but they don't even have it a feed with enclosures.

472
00:35:23,771 --> 00:35:24,073
Scott: It's just.

473
00:35:24,153 --> 00:35:38,990
Scott: I would have to go to their website every once in a while to Maybe find a new episode if I'm lucky and it's just not worth the effort no matter how good their show is The effort of constantly checking a website all the time for a new episode.

474
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:42,230
Rym: Yeah, I mean some people listen to one or two podcasts.

475
00:35:42,371 --> 00:35:49,296
Rym: Yeah, they'll just go to the website every day and download the episode But if the episode gets uploaded an hour later Then they'll miss it till the next day.

476
00:35:49,316 --> 00:35:54,510
Rym: or if you listen to 20 podcasts and they update every day Why not just have it all automatic?

477
00:35:55,350 --> 00:36:04,450
Rym: So if one podcast isn't automatic they really lose out on listenership just because a lot of like most people who listen to the podcasts They don't even know that you can listen to them outside of iTunes.

478
00:36:05,192 --> 00:36:07,164
Rym: So it doesn't show up in iTunes as far as they're concerned.

479
00:36:07,184 --> 00:36:07,989
Rym: It doesn't even exist.

480
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:11,199
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty sad that you know it.

481
00:36:11,821 --> 00:36:14,575
Scott: It was a big mistake when they came up with the word podcast It's like.

482
00:36:14,636 --> 00:36:22,417
Scott: at first they thought all right That's the perfect word, and then they're like oh wait now We have to tell everyone a thousand times that you don't need an iPod You don't need iTunes.

483
00:36:22,497 --> 00:36:25,210
Rym: and yeah, how many times when we tell someone one of our old friends?

484
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,121
Rym: Hey, we do a radio show now a podcast.

485
00:36:27,584 --> 00:36:30,536
Rym: Oh, I don't have an iPod You don't need one.

486
00:36:30,717 --> 00:36:35,030
Scott: if you can play an mp3 and download an mp3 you can listen to podcasts.

487
00:36:36,032 --> 00:36:36,374
Scott: That's it.

488
00:36:36,979 --> 00:36:43,943
Rym: Yep now in terms of actually Recording or doing this it seems There's a lot of bad information out there on the internet.

489
00:36:44,004 --> 00:37:04,044
Rym: if you just think like oh I'm gonna do a podcast and Google around or look at what other people have said they've done I hate to say it But most of the guides out there Really give terrible advice as to how to make your audio sound good or how to use the applications properly or actually This is kind of an aside, but the worst thing is that Apple seems to really push a lot of their solutions like buy a Mac.

490
00:37:04,084 --> 00:37:11,887
Rym: It's really easy to podcast and We found by doing it four nights a week that Macs are really not a good solution for podcasting at all.

491
00:37:11,987 --> 00:37:15,437
Rym: and GarageBand Which is really promoted as this podcasting tool.

492
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:22,160
Rym: if you go beyond the most amateur level in the world like if you try to go Anywhere beyond that it's pretty much unusable.

493
00:37:22,984 --> 00:37:32,150
Rym: It just it doesn't have the functionality It doesn't have the features it has arbitrary limits in it Like you can't even record an episode as long as you want because it'll arbitrarily say oh that was too long.

494
00:37:32,212 --> 00:37:32,787
Rym: I'm stopping you.

495
00:37:33,452 --> 00:37:48,432
Scott: The worst thing about if you use GarageBand to make a podcast and you don't know what you're doing if you just follow the instructions That Apple gives you you will accidentally make a podcast that really does need an iPod or iTunes to listen to and that's really Really bad.

496
00:37:48,472 --> 00:37:54,854
Scott: you're basically saying oh those millions of people with windows and whatever they can't listen to my show Screw them.

497
00:37:55,055 --> 00:37:58,490
Scott: only Apple people can listen to my show which is not very good.

498
00:37:58,872 --> 00:38:00,300
Rym: Yeah, one of our listeners wants asked us.

499
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,110
Rym: Why don't you do the Apple enhanced podcast?

500
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,428
Rym: I think it would be really cool.

501
00:38:03,831 --> 00:38:09,548
Rym: We had to explain to him that that would alienate at least half of our listeners who don't have Apple don't have iPods And they still want to listen.

502
00:38:10,232 --> 00:38:11,274
Scott: Yeah, also the.

503
00:38:11,475 --> 00:38:21,570
Scott: if you could we could do some people put an enhanced podcast and a normal mp3 podcast up together But that doubles the amount of bandwidth and storage we need and it really really sucks.

504
00:38:22,452 --> 00:38:24,241
Rym: Now what we use to actually record the show.

505
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:25,810
Rym: we'll take a whole bunch of questions in a little bit.

506
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,850
Rym: We've got a lovely assistant here Nury.

507
00:38:28,191 --> 00:38:36,624
Rym: We'll be going around with a microphone at some point because we are recording this and it's all going to go up on our show After we get back from the Jersey Shore at some point.

508
00:38:38,891 --> 00:38:46,389
Rym: But we've got a Linux box actually running Gentoo and on that we run a program called resound Which is if anyone has ever heard of it?

509
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:58,610
Scott: It's like an old program called cool edit Pro or cool edit 2000 Which yeah, if you can get cool edit Pro or cool edit 2000 Those are the ultimate wave editing programs ever created and you can make awesome podcasts with that.

510
00:38:58,691 --> 00:39:00,490
Scott: But it's they don't make it anymore.

511
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:08,359
Scott: What happened was Adobe bought it and then they removed a bunch of good stuff from it and added a bunch of other Crap that you don't care about to it.

512
00:39:08,419 --> 00:39:10,370
Scott: and they called it audition and they doubled the price.

513
00:39:11,071 --> 00:39:16,450
Rym: So I mean cool edit really was the industry standard for a lot of radio stations like professional ones for the longest time.

514
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:21,830
Rym: But resound is an open source program that it mimics almost all the functionality of cool edit.

515
00:39:22,513 --> 00:39:27,071
Rym: And it's actually got to the point now where there are many cases where it goes beyond what cool edit can even do in the first Place.

516
00:39:27,693 --> 00:39:30,141
Scott: Yeah, but if you're loaded you can buy audition.

517
00:39:30,381 --> 00:39:33,110
Scott: if you're poor you can install Linux and get resound for free.

518
00:39:33,672 --> 00:39:38,970
Rym: Now what most people use who do podcasts actually is a program called audacity, which is also open source.

519
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,978
Rym: But you can run it on Windows Linux.

520
00:39:40,998 --> 00:39:44,230
Rym: you can even run it on Macs if you want and it's really easy to use.

521
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:44,631
Rym: It's got.

522
00:39:45,093 --> 00:39:49,990
Rym: basic functionality is there to where you could put a pretty good podcast with it even not knowing a lot about audio.

523
00:39:50,751 --> 00:40:00,827
Scott: Yeah, but if you get really if you get more advanced audacity will eventually not have the features you're looking for and you know Some of the filters in it, you might want to do something different and it just doesn't have.

524
00:40:00,847 --> 00:40:07,310
Scott: you know The controls that you want and you know, so if you keep it simple and audacity is probably all you're ever gonna need.

525
00:40:07,451 --> 00:40:10,570
Scott: But if you want to do fancy stuff, you're gonna need something else like resound.

526
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:16,789
Rym: I mean really in terms of what you use to do a podcast you have to decide Are you doing this just for fun?

527
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:19,790
Rym: Do you really want to learn about how to do this the professional way?

528
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:21,736
Rym: How deeply do you want to get into this?

529
00:40:22,037 --> 00:40:24,769
Rym: because the scale of money you can spend is from five bucks to?

530
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:28,664
Rym: Tens of thousands of dollars on fancy equipment like a certain podcast.

531
00:40:28,684 --> 00:40:30,170
Rym: We know that still doesn't sound so good.

532
00:40:30,411 --> 00:40:33,345
Scott: Yeah, I mean look at all this equipment those guys have over there.

533
00:40:33,406 --> 00:40:36,349
Scott: if we had that stuff We could make some crazy freaking podcast.

534
00:40:36,711 --> 00:40:40,550
Rym: The AV guy who sets up this room was actually laughing at our tiny little mixer we have here?

535
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:46,830
Scott: Yeah, instead we have like a hundred dollars worth of junk on the floor, which is more than most people have.

536
00:40:47,051 --> 00:40:53,889
Rym: Yeah, yeah, we'll go through all the hardware in a minute and we try to show it to you But it's all plugged in but after the panel we can totally just show you like everything we've got.

537
00:40:53,929 --> 00:41:00,271
Rym: now It's plugged in but in terms of actually doing the podcast and you know how deeply you want to get into it There's.

538
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:17,136
Rym: you have to learn a lot about audio and if you use like resound or audacity and you get Audio textbooks and you actually try to learn how to do it better as opposed to using an apple Which will make it sound pretty good to start, but you really can't go anywhere from there You'll learn a lot about audio.

539
00:41:17,157 --> 00:41:20,410
Rym: You'll learn a lot of valuable skills that maybe you could use in a job someday.

540
00:41:20,491 --> 00:41:23,550
Rym: I mean you can put audio engineer on your resume there.

541
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:27,849
Rym: You've already gained something from podcasting even if your podcast pod fades as they like to call it.

542
00:41:28,372 --> 00:41:30,159
Scott: Yeah, and I mean even if you.

543
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,470
Scott: there's also this web hosting side of it.

544
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:33,514
Scott: You know, there's a lot of.

545
00:41:33,916 --> 00:41:35,443
Scott: you need to manage blog software.

546
00:41:35,463 --> 00:41:39,790
Scott: you need to manage the RSS feed You need to manage all those podcast directories.

547
00:41:40,132 --> 00:41:43,790
Scott: So in addition to getting audio engineering skills, you're getting a lot of webmastering skills.

548
00:41:44,432 --> 00:41:47,423
Scott: If you don't have the webmastering skills, your podcast isn't going to work.

549
00:41:47,986 --> 00:41:57,250
Rym: Yeah, like most podcasters they either use something like libsyn which has a good service for doing podcasts or They'll use wordpress.com and then feed burner to run the feed.

550
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:03,230
Rym: We'll talk about all that stuff in detail, but we actually because we're technologists I mean, we're both computer professionals.

551
00:42:03,853 --> 00:42:11,570
Rym: We have our own hosting as in we have our own Linux box in the sky that we run our own Everything on our own web server our own forums our own jabber server.

552
00:42:12,272 --> 00:42:16,527
Scott: Yeah, it's a lot of fun to actually manage everything on the low level that way.

553
00:42:16,647 --> 00:42:26,570
Scott: if something goes wrong I know it's my fault and I know I can fix it instead of having to wait for some guy Who might be on vacation to come and do something to some computer somewhere?

554
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:28,969
Rym: But at the same time it takes a lot more work.

555
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:37,997
Rym: I mean if you're just using like libsyn and libsyn goes down all you do is email libsyn and say hey my podcast disappeared WTF and maybe it'll come back up at some point.

556
00:42:38,499 --> 00:42:40,044
Rym: we if it goes down.

557
00:42:40,265 --> 00:42:41,629
Rym: we have to sit there and try to fix it.

558
00:42:42,571 --> 00:42:47,310
Rym: But at the same time by dealing with all that you'll learn a lot and your podcast will get better and better and better.

559
00:42:47,411 --> 00:42:51,721
Rym: it'll sound better it'll look more professional and You'll learn a lot.

560
00:42:51,741 --> 00:42:52,167
Rym: What can I say?

561
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:58,329
Scott: Yeah, so if you actually want to make a podcast, you know, you get the software we just described to you.

562
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:02,224
Scott: You plug a microphone into the computer and you push record.

563
00:43:02,244 --> 00:43:03,830
Scott: It's really that easy.

564
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:09,350
Rym: Microphones are a big source of confusion for a lot of people because most people you buy a computer.

565
00:43:09,852 --> 00:43:15,630
Rym: It either has a microphone built into it or it comes with like that tiny little white stick microphone that comes with most sound cards.

566
00:43:16,394 --> 00:43:19,349
Rym: You really me you really can't use that.

567
00:43:19,851 --> 00:43:25,390
Rym: I mean it's cheap, but your podcast will sound terrible like if anyone listened to the first penny arcade podcast.

568
00:43:26,111 --> 00:43:29,810
Rym: They basically use something like that sitting on one side of the room and it just it was almost unlistenable.

569
00:43:30,711 --> 00:43:32,276
Rym: But that doesn't mean you have to spend a lot of money.

570
00:43:32,617 --> 00:43:36,250
Rym: We have $20 RadioShack microphones and our broadcast sounds pretty good.

571
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:41,616
Rym: I think I could say yeah, I think we need to buy some of these things though We got to upgrade at this point.

572
00:43:41,817 --> 00:43:51,330
Scott: Yeah, since we have this giant crowd here, obviously Please don't spend more money than your skill allows.

573
00:43:51,471 --> 00:44:00,557
Scott: I mean a lot of people will you know, they get in, you know They get into something and then they buy fancy equipment like guys will get into golf and then they'll buy a fancy set of golf Clubs thinking it'll make them better at golf.

574
00:44:01,018 --> 00:44:02,564
Scott: The same thing is true with podcasting.

575
00:44:02,584 --> 00:44:04,110
Scott: a lot of people get into podcasting.

576
00:44:04,373 --> 00:44:09,667
Scott: They spend thousands of dollars Like I get a fancy microphone at a big mixer and they don't know really how to use it.

577
00:44:09,727 --> 00:44:13,410
Scott: that well So it doesn't help their audio quality that much.

578
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:21,569
Scott: We've done the opposite where we spend the minimum Possible and we use our knowledge to bring the quality up above a lot of the people who spend more money than we do.

579
00:44:22,353 --> 00:44:26,070
Rym: Because really I mean podcasting is fun and great and you can just do it in your spare time.

580
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:33,268
Rym: But it will take a lot of time and a lot of effort at least initially as you Learn how to edit audio and you learn what sounds good and what doesn't.

581
00:44:33,328 --> 00:44:46,083
Rym: I mean When we started doing the show it would take me about three hours after every episode to Do all the stuff to it to make it sound good to you guys, you know post-production editing out, you know Scott coughing or Scott burping or Scott dropping the microphone

582
00:44:46,303 --> 00:44:47,588
Scott: Rym hacking up a loogie.

583
00:44:47,829 --> 00:44:57,679
Rym: Yeah Yeah, or when we forget something or you forget what we're talking about or we forget the mics aren't actually on and we talk for An hour or you accidentally delete the whole episode.

584
00:44:57,699 --> 00:44:59,987
Rym: that only happened two or three times.

585
00:45:00,228 --> 00:45:10,778
Rym: Yeah okay, and As it goes on it's gotten to the point now where it takes us literally maybe two minutes worth of Editing to make the show ready to go yet.

586
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:14,410
Scott: What really takes the longest now is the actual computer processing.

587
00:45:14,491 --> 00:45:15,054
Scott: I mean Rym's.

588
00:45:15,095 --> 00:45:17,370
Scott: computer is a half on one gigahertz.

589
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:20,604
Scott: It takes you know, he clicks make mp3 and we wait ten minutes.

590
00:45:20,805 --> 00:45:22,050
Scott: It's it's really kind of painful.

591
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:23,796
Rym: Hey, I built that computer for $4,000 in like 1999.

592
00:45:23,796 --> 00:45:29,492
Rym: It's time to buy a new box Now.

593
00:45:29,512 --> 00:45:37,870
Rym: I suppose I mean we could ramble on a lot about all the specific details of what we use for hosting what we use Equipment wise but I guess at this point we could send our lovely assistant.

594
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:43,925
Rym: And if you guys have specific questions since it's kind of a small crowd I guess we can really address all of you almost individual.

595
00:45:43,966 --> 00:45:44,550
Rym: if you really want.

596
00:45:44,731 --> 00:45:45,455
Scott: Yeah, we'll get all nice.

597
00:45:45,495 --> 00:45:47,024
Rym: and yes, that was indeed your cue.

598
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:49,156
Rym: Oh lovely assistant This is Mary.

599
00:45:49,176 --> 00:45:51,530
Rym: by the way, who does a podcast called artists alley?

600
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,994
Scott: Don't turn it on in front of the speakers or we'll all die.

601
00:45:57,175 --> 00:45:59,995
Rym: Yes walk it Walk across then turn it on.

602
00:46:01,702 --> 00:46:02,327
Rym: See it's amazing.

603
00:46:02,367 --> 00:46:03,980
Rym: I do just doing this for so long.

604
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,280
Rym: You'll learn so much about how to deal with all this audio stuff or like how to hold a microphone properly.

605
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,814
Rym: We've Scott still kind of struggling with from time to time.

606
00:46:12,156 --> 00:46:12,679
Scott: What can I say?

607
00:46:15,094 --> 00:46:17,309
Scott: Hello You were mentioned.

608
00:46:17,369 --> 00:46:21,291
Scott: you were talking earlier about Enhanced podcast Apple enhanced podcast.

609
00:46:21,331 --> 00:46:23,420
Scott: What's the difference between an enhanced podcast?

610
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:27,278
Scott: I think okay our podcast is an mp3 file.

611
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:30,809
Scott: You can play it on anything that plays an mp3.

612
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:33,697
Scott: an enhanced podcast is an Apple.

613
00:46:33,777 --> 00:46:34,900
Scott: It's a special Apple thing.

614
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:35,804
Scott: That's Apple only.

615
00:46:35,844 --> 00:46:41,097
Scott: so you need iTunes or an iPod and what they do is first It's an AAC file and not an mp3.

616
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:45,593
Scott: So you need some software that can play an AAC in order to hear the audio.

617
00:46:45,934 --> 00:46:52,791
Rym: now a lot of modern even not iPods But mp3 players will play AAC But not everything and there are people who actually couldn't listen to now.

618
00:46:52,831 --> 00:46:58,940
Scott: in addition what it does for you is if you have this Normal AAC is which are just audio and that's not a big deal.

619
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:01,250
Scott: But an enhanced AAC does.

620
00:47:01,793 --> 00:47:02,817
Scott: it does three things for you.

621
00:47:02,877 --> 00:47:03,359
Scott: number one?

622
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:06,760
Scott: You can put like these markers within your podcast.

623
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:11,780
Scott: So for example our podcast starts out with the news and the thing of the day than the main bit.

624
00:47:12,222 --> 00:47:22,258
Scott: We can put little markers at the beginning of each segment that allow people using the enhanced Podcast to skip around to different segments, so it's like chapter markers on exactly.

625
00:47:22,278 --> 00:47:28,300
Scott: it Also allows you to put different images album covers for different parts of the podcast.

626
00:47:28,461 --> 00:47:34,602
Scott: so if you're talking about a race car in the first part of the episode you can have a picture of a race car as The album art.

627
00:47:34,683 --> 00:47:39,602
Scott: and then later on you're talking about the or really owl and you have a picture of an owl is the album Art.

628
00:47:40,205 --> 00:47:42,479
Scott: and the third thing it does is it allows you.

629
00:47:43,362 --> 00:47:46,791
Scott: It allows you to put a link to a website in the album art.

630
00:47:46,832 --> 00:47:57,220
Scott: so if someone's listening with iTunes, and you start talking about Otakon then there'll be a picture of the Otakon logo down there with a link to Otakon.com right there.

631
00:47:57,441 --> 00:48:01,966
Scott: So if someone's listening and they go oh, that's pretty interesting they look over in the corner They see a link.

632
00:48:02,006 --> 00:48:02,651
Scott: they click on it.

633
00:48:02,692 --> 00:48:03,700
Scott: it opens up in their browser.

634
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:11,020
Scott: It's actually pretty cool, but you're alienating so many listeners by doing it that it's kind of not worth it.

635
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:12,660
Rym: Yeah, I mean we're not saying don't do it at all.

636
00:48:12,741 --> 00:48:14,210
Rym: We're just saying we don't do it because of our.

637
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:15,820
Rym: we really kind of have a broad appeal.

638
00:48:15,981 --> 00:48:22,306
Rym: But in terms of there are a lot of podcasts that make very good use of that like podcasts that tried to teach you Japanese which there are a lot of.

639
00:48:22,828 --> 00:48:27,820
Rym: they'll show the Kana or they'll show kanji while they talk about him And it's a great method of learning all the kanji.

640
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:38,741
Rym: you know if you see the kanji there in your iPod and it's telling you about the kanji and then the next one back and forth or Technology podcast they'll show the schematic diagram of whatever thing they're talking about while they're talking about it Which

641
00:48:38,901 --> 00:48:50,099
Scott: yeah, I find it's really good for music podcast because you you know as you listen to different songs throughout the podcast You'll see the cover of the album that they're playing and you'll have a link to the band's website And all that kind of cool stuff.

642
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:53,948
Scott: But yeah If you have a lot of money and a lot of bandwidth.

643
00:48:54,068 --> 00:49:02,620
Scott: you can do a normal mp3 and an enhanced podcast for the people Who want the enhanced podcast, but if you can't afford you know double?

644
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:07,899
Scott: Bandwidth and double the storage for all your podcasting needs, then you probably should just make an mp3.

645
00:49:08,682 --> 00:49:13,099
Rym: Yeah, I mean we already spend over a thousand dollars a year just on bandwidth and hosting at this point.

646
00:49:13,601 --> 00:49:15,090
Rym: Yeah, we'd add in two feeds.

647
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:15,975
Rym: We'd have double that.

648
00:49:16,257 --> 00:49:22,470
Scott: yeah All right question Dylan time.

649
00:49:23,981 --> 00:49:25,679
Scott: Actually sort of a direct question.

650
00:49:26,601 --> 00:49:29,358
Scott: I've just started listening to your podcast, so I haven't caught up yet.

651
00:49:30,203 --> 00:49:37,286
Scott: By now has somebody told you what the duty of grand Fenwick is The touchy of grand Fenwick.

652
00:49:37,828 --> 00:49:40,498
Rym: we had a couple people answer the question which made me very happy.

653
00:49:40,538 --> 00:49:52,079
Rym: good Yeah, our podcast has actually gotten a somewhat interesting community around it to the point that our forums are basically a whole Text-based show I mean unto themselves.

654
00:49:54,230 --> 00:50:15,677
Scott: Yeah All right, I have a Convention well a meeting and we want to podcast those two people who were not able to attend that and we have Some background hiss from our audio equipment Because again we couldn't afford to bring big stuff.

655
00:50:17,301 --> 00:50:19,263
Scott: Is there software to take out that?

656
00:50:19,283 --> 00:50:23,088
Scott: yes before we actually broadcast it and what?

657
00:50:23,108 --> 00:50:24,270
Scott: how difficult is that to do?

658
00:50:25,334 --> 00:50:35,441
Rym: There I could go into excruciating detail into how to Like how to take the hiss out how to get rid of noise all that stuff And I'll try to keep it as informative and yet light as I can.

659
00:50:35,541 --> 00:50:41,150
Rym: but basically there are a couple of ways to deal with Noise, I mean you know most of you've ever tried to record something on your computer.

660
00:50:41,511 --> 00:50:49,108
Rym: There's that hissing noise in the background or a low hum sometimes or your voice is just really scratchy I hope sounds like those.

661
00:50:50,132 --> 00:50:54,847
Scott: Or you breathe into the microphone you know because you hold it next to your face all the time like that.

662
00:50:57,210 --> 00:50:59,140
Scott: Yeah, or the speaker.

663
00:50:59,944 --> 00:51:05,552
Scott: some of them are nailing the mic Microphone.

664
00:51:05,612 --> 00:51:07,903
Rym: discipline is a very important part of podcasting.

665
00:51:07,943 --> 00:51:09,189
Rym: How annoying is this right now?

666
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:11,587
Rym: Would you listen to a podcast that did this for an hour?

667
00:51:13,391 --> 00:51:19,081
Rym: There are so many to do and I hate it because I like the podcast But I just can't listen to him because they keep going like this.

668
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,790
Rym: I have no idea what they're actually talking about.

669
00:51:21,673 --> 00:51:35,689
Rym: But in terms of like hisses and noise If you the hardware solution is something called a noise gate which in its simplest form is a tiny little thing that says whenever the Audio level is below a certain threshold it gets rid of all the audio there at all.

670
00:51:36,131 --> 00:51:40,070
Rym: So if there's a low hiss whenever you're not talking that low hiss disappears.

671
00:51:40,291 --> 00:51:44,047
Rym: And then when you amplify the whole podcast it doesn't amplify that hissing.

672
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:44,770
Rym: you make it a louder hiss.

673
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:47,323
Rym: More advanced ways to get rid of noise.

674
00:51:47,383 --> 00:51:54,670
Rym: if you use audacity It has a nice function where you highlight an empty part of your podcast like while you're recording you record 10 seconds of silence.

675
00:51:55,137 --> 00:52:02,221
Rym: You highlight it And then you kick a. they call it a noise signature And it'll try to figure out what frequencies all the noise are in.

676
00:52:02,622 --> 00:52:07,782
Rym: and then you can remove that from the rest of the show Which works with varying degrees of success.

677
00:52:07,963 --> 00:52:09,208
Rym: you really have to experiment with it.

678
00:52:09,731 --> 00:52:13,222
Rym: Generally the more noise you remove the more you sound like a robot on the show.

679
00:52:14,125 --> 00:52:16,666
Scott: I can't tell you how many robot podcasts I've listened to it.

680
00:52:19,031 --> 00:52:20,114
Rym: The hardware in general.

681
00:52:20,154 --> 00:52:26,034
Rym: in terms of this sort of thing a hardware solution is always better than a software solution in terms of quality And ease of use.

682
00:52:26,457 --> 00:52:28,990
Rym: but a software solution is usually free.

683
00:52:30,393 --> 00:52:30,900
Rym: That is key.

684
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:31,690
Rym: I mean a noise gate.

685
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:39,809
Rym: You know twenty thirty dollars But it all adds up as you buy noise gates compressors for every audio problem you have there's a piece of hardware That'll make it go away.

686
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:48,350
Scott: But that's one more chunk of money you have to spend and even when there is a piece of hardware that can make your problem You're gonna have to spend some time learning to use that piece of hardware.

687
00:52:48,531 --> 00:52:49,859
Scott: I mean a noise gates.

688
00:52:49,879 --> 00:52:54,059
Scott: pretty simple I could set one of those up But a compressor is a lot more difficult.

689
00:52:54,179 --> 00:52:56,969
Scott: if you don't know about audio engineering you're gonna have to read some books.

690
00:52:57,857 --> 00:53:07,915
Scott: Yeah Actually when we did record this we had it compressed and that was part of the problem because it was a little bit of a noisy Mixer.

691
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:10,328
Scott: so it did bring the floor up and that brought the noise up.

692
00:53:11,075 --> 00:53:19,279
Rym: Actually if you have a big problem with noise There's a hardware thing or actually you can do this in software in a lot of programs called an expander Which obviously opposite of a compressor.

693
00:53:19,842 --> 00:53:21,770
Rym: now actually I'll talk about this now.

694
00:53:21,971 --> 00:53:26,886
Rym: It's a nice segue because this is really an important part of podcasting that very few podcasts.

695
00:53:26,906 --> 00:53:27,950
Rym: You know how to do properly.

696
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:37,510
Rym: There there are two ways to deal with noise and two ways to deal with audio levels But generally you want everything in a podcast to be about the same volume.

697
00:53:37,651 --> 00:53:39,629
Rym: It's not music or there's a quiet part in a loud part.

698
00:53:40,011 --> 00:53:44,589
Rym: You don't want one guy in a podcast to be really loud and one guy to be really quiet because that's annoying.

699
00:53:44,609 --> 00:53:51,524
Rym: and a compressor what it does is It'll once the audio gets above a certain loudness.

700
00:53:51,946 --> 00:53:57,070
Rym: It'll start Decreasing the amplitude or reducing the gain on that audio further.

701
00:53:57,151 --> 00:54:00,109
Rym: So the louder I talk the more it turns the volume down on me.

702
00:54:00,511 --> 00:54:04,450
Rym: So in the end no matter how much I yell the podcast it still sounds pretty much the same.

703
00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:05,965
Rym: it doesn't get that much louder.

704
00:54:05,986 --> 00:54:13,030
Rym: and The problem with this is that you're making the whole thing quieter as a result because all they can do is take away audio.

705
00:54:13,813 --> 00:54:17,590
Rym: Now you have noise like the hissing the hum and all that and that's really low.

706
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:21,465
Rym: That's like this low level like you look at a picture of a wave, you know, the actual audio.

707
00:54:21,826 --> 00:54:35,530
Rym: There's this low-level warbling going on when no one's talking and If you compress the highest vocal points the highest Amplitude of the wave the points where you're talking the loudest are far away from that noise.

708
00:54:36,052 --> 00:54:38,180
Rym: That way the noise is overpowered by your voice.

709
00:54:38,622 --> 00:54:43,349
Rym: when you compress you make that How I'm trying to do this in such non-technical terms.

710
00:54:44,313 --> 00:54:46,964
Scott: If you fail miserably, you're bringing those peaks down.

711
00:54:47,024 --> 00:54:51,181
Rym: you're bringing your audio level down Which means my voice is now closer to that noise.

712
00:54:51,683 --> 00:54:53,250
Rym: So you've brought the noise floor up.

713
00:54:53,912 --> 00:54:58,250
Rym: The floor below which the noise is is higher and as a result, there's more noise in your podcast.

714
00:54:58,571 --> 00:55:04,695
Scott: it makes a lot more sense when you look at some of the waves from when you talk and then you can see ah Someone shows you a picture of.

715
00:55:04,735 --> 00:55:08,930
Scott: this is what a good wave should look like and this is what you have recorded.

716
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:10,239
Scott: You're like, oh my god.

717
00:55:10,299 --> 00:55:11,085
Scott: It's so bad.

718
00:55:11,105 --> 00:55:15,830
Rym: Oh Just basically it if Scott yells it turns the volume down on him automatically.

719
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:17,770
Rym: Now an expander is what you need.

720
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:19,517
Rym: It does the exact opposite it.

721
00:55:19,778 --> 00:55:22,168
Rym: the louder something is the louder it makes it.

722
00:55:22,429 --> 00:55:26,321
Rym: so it Expands the audio and it amplifies everything except the noise.

723
00:55:26,662 --> 00:55:29,170
Rym: it amplifies everything that's above a certain threshold.

724
00:55:29,612 --> 00:55:35,240
Rym: so the noise or the hiss which is below that won't get picked up and That would probably deal with the problem.

725
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:39,791
Rym: you have at least to some degree All right more questions.

726
00:55:44,917 --> 00:55:47,320
Rym: I swear to God if we get feedback in this room, I'll scream.

727
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:56,515
Scott: hi Um, yeah, my question is that say like that a couple of my friends of mine want to do a pocket but we want for example interview somebody but they're not in the same room.

728
00:55:56,555 --> 00:55:57,098
Scott: as I say like.

729
00:55:57,118 --> 00:56:00,877
Scott: they're like Oh Just like in another state or something.

730
00:56:02,246 --> 00:56:03,320
Scott: What's for PC users?

731
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:06,008
Scott: What's the best software you recommend for that?

732
00:56:06,309 --> 00:56:09,740
Scott: to do a conference and report a podcast before you're interviewing someone?

733
00:56:10,482 --> 00:56:11,674
Rym: Well, there's a story here.

734
00:56:12,037 --> 00:56:12,299
Scott: Okay?

735
00:56:13,982 --> 00:56:18,559
Scott: There are many many ways and as always a lot of money will make it really easy.

736
00:56:19,082 --> 00:56:21,914
Rym: Well, did we tell the funny story first about how we failed at this?

737
00:56:22,336 --> 00:56:23,180
Scott: All right, tell the story.

738
00:56:23,321 --> 00:56:24,347
Rym: It's Otakon related.

739
00:56:24,689 --> 00:56:27,929
Rym: So about two months ago We did what.

740
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:31,388
Rym: we did a bunch of stuff on Otakon The artist alley fiasco.

741
00:56:31,408 --> 00:56:43,540
Rym: that happened when there was the misunderstanding and as a result we ended up talking to Jim bottles a bunch the con chair of Otakon this year and He expressed interest in having us interview him on the show and we thought this is gonna be fantastic.

742
00:56:43,661 --> 00:56:44,525
Rym: The con chair of Otakon.

743
00:56:44,565 --> 00:56:45,249
Rym: we get to talk to him.

744
00:56:45,269 --> 00:56:46,918
Rym: We're gonna ask him so much stuff off the record.

745
00:56:46,958 --> 00:56:47,320
Rym: Oh my god.

746
00:56:48,441 --> 00:56:55,272
Rym: So we get him on and he doesn't want to use Skype because for various reasons Skype is good But it's also bad and he had a Mac and we had.

747
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:55,835
Rym: we didn't.

748
00:56:55,875 --> 00:56:56,720
Rym: we had a Mac eventually.

749
00:56:57,161 --> 00:57:01,878
Rym: So we decided to try to use I chat which supposedly integrates with garage band.

750
00:57:01,978 --> 00:57:08,148
Scott: Yes Theoretically if you have I chat your garage band And so it is the other person you can.

751
00:57:08,329 --> 00:57:11,300
Scott: I chat with each other and garage band will record your conversation.

752
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:17,359
Scott: That will fail if they have a really really old version of I chat like Jim bowels does.

753
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:21,055
Scott: Now some other solutions are you can get.

754
00:57:21,075 --> 00:57:28,937
Scott: I forget what the name of it is but this is telephone bridge where you can actually use an actual telephone and plug the telephone cable into something.

755
00:57:28,978 --> 00:57:32,640
Scott: that then goes into your Computer and you can record it as if it was a microphone.

756
00:57:32,801 --> 00:57:36,320
Scott: But it's a telephone and then you just call them on the phone and start talking.

757
00:57:36,884 --> 00:57:38,779
Rym: Now the audio that way is usually pretty bad.

758
00:57:39,261 --> 00:57:46,405
Scott: I think you have to know a lot about audio to make that work properly and even then just telephones in general a very Low audio quality.

759
00:57:46,445 --> 00:57:51,459
Rym: I mean we did some interviews over cell phones and it was listenable, but it sounded pretty bad.

760
00:57:51,559 --> 00:57:51,940
Rym: overall.

761
00:57:52,682 --> 00:58:06,039
Rym: I'd say the best solution if you don't have a lot of equipment You have a lot of PCs is something called gizmo phone Which is a lot like Skype voice over IP, but it has recording built into it So you can just record the whole conversation without having to do anything special.

762
00:58:06,843 --> 00:58:14,311
Rym: Skype has no built-in way to record what you're talking about and There are no really easy ways to get around that that.

763
00:58:14,471 --> 00:58:26,740
Scott: your choices for recording Skype are pretty much there's like a couple programs called like hot recorder or turbo recorder or something like that and They have ads and you have to pay their shareware and they will record Skype.

764
00:58:26,967 --> 00:58:27,380
Scott: They you know.

765
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:31,494
Scott: You just open Skype start talking push the button in the recorder and it will record.

766
00:58:32,056 --> 00:58:33,260
Rym: what some people do is they'll.

767
00:58:33,881 --> 00:58:46,788
Rym: They'll do the Skype where one person records what comes out of their speakers the other person records that comes out of their speakers and then they mix it together and that is the most tedious and Terrible way you could possibly do it But a lot of podcasts do it that way.

768
00:58:46,948 --> 00:58:51,635
Scott: now the correct way to record Skype is Actually somewhat difficult to set up.

769
00:58:51,756 --> 00:58:57,202
Scott: audio wise I mean if you don't have you need a mixer you need a bunch of cables you need two Computers

770
00:58:57,542 --> 00:58:58,164
Rym: on your end

771
00:58:58,625 --> 00:59:07,615
Scott: and what you do is you have a computer that records the audio you have a computer that only does Skype and you treat the output of the computer.

772
00:59:07,635 --> 00:59:12,860
Scott: that does Skype as You know a person with a microphone and you plug them into your mixer.

773
00:59:13,302 --> 00:59:22,335
Scott: The thing is you then have to send back what you say to the Skype computer So the person can hear you talking without sending them back what they say.

774
00:59:22,536 --> 00:59:27,272
Scott: because then you know If they talk it comes into your computer then goes back out to them.

775
00:59:27,312 --> 00:59:29,900
Scott: They hear everything they say and it really screws it up.

776
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,364
Scott: So you need a mixer.

777
00:59:31,384 --> 00:59:34,113
Scott: I need to fiddle with the auxilary settings and it's.

778
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:38,160
Rym: there's no way I can explain easily Without showing you how to do it.

779
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:43,894
Rym: But after the panel anyone wants to see come on up and I'll show you exactly How we do that and where the cables go and how it all works.

780
00:59:43,995 --> 00:59:44,920
Scott: There is an episode.

781
00:59:45,061 --> 00:59:48,593
Scott: There is a TV show I think I'm revision 3.com or whatever.

782
00:59:48,633 --> 00:59:52,424
Scott: the URL is called system Systm and they have.

783
00:59:52,605 --> 00:59:57,103
Scott: there was an episode where they went to this guy Leo Laporte who's a big-time Podcasting guy.

784
00:59:57,123 --> 01:00:05,200
Scott: they went to his house and he showed everyone like the ISDN box He had and this giant mixer and how he set up Skype and that's how we figured out how to do it.

785
01:00:05,281 --> 01:00:06,498
Scott: We saw exactly what he did.

786
01:00:07,428 --> 01:00:24,132
Scott: my question is When it comes to Group environments where you have multiple people talking in a room at the same time You have a group discussion and you can't get individuals up to the microphone one at a time Do you have an arrangement for that a solution for that?

787
01:00:24,192 --> 01:00:25,457
Scott: Well, there are two ways.

788
01:00:25,477 --> 01:00:33,080
Rym: Well, actually we had a lot of experience with that last night and Generally, I mean we do the show together.

789
01:00:33,181 --> 01:00:38,857
Rym: We also live together in college for a long time A lot of listeners seem to think that we are gay which was kind of Larry's.

790
01:00:38,877 --> 01:00:39,943
Scott: we're not gay We're just.

791
01:00:40,366 --> 01:00:41,573
Rym: well, what was the term from clerks?

792
01:00:42,257 --> 01:00:57,440
Rym: I don't know But we've been friends for so long and actually all these people that we know too when we record a show We just we have these cues and even for all in the room together talking It's really no big deal in terms of cutting people off.

793
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,890
Rym: There's just kind of this vibe and flow and especially us.

794
01:00:59,931 --> 01:01:03,928
Rym: when we get a third person on our show as a guest They can't get a word in edgewise.

795
01:01:04,169 --> 01:01:06,520
Rym: we have to force ourselves to shut up and let them talk.

796
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:14,820
Scott: Yes, some people like invited us onto their podcasts and you know inviting one of us is okay But if they invite both of us, it basically becomes an episode of our show.

797
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:21,476
Rym: Yeah What we were with them is the guess we appeared on what geek speak and it was just us talking to each other for an Hour and him kind of like.

798
01:01:21,759 --> 01:01:24,943
Scott: yeah Yeah, if you want to record a group There's two ways you could do it.

799
01:01:24,983 --> 01:01:29,677
Scott: number one you get a mixer and a whole bunch of microphones one for everybody.

800
01:01:29,778 --> 01:01:31,724
Rym: again money can Every problem.

801
01:01:32,286 --> 01:01:37,384
Scott: number two you can get I haven't actually found one yet up for sale But you can get them.

802
01:01:37,504 --> 01:01:45,620
Scott: there are these omni directional mics that you can put in the middle of a table that you know They use them for like teleconferencing and offices and things and if you get one of those it might call.

803
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:46,486
Scott: I don't know how much they cost.

804
01:01:46,506 --> 01:01:47,453
Scott: They're probably a lot of money.

805
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:53,684
Scott: 60 70 bucks Yes But if they if you get one of those you put it in the middle of table and you Everyone's voice will come through.

806
01:01:53,744 --> 01:01:58,360
Scott: the quality won't be amazing, but it'll be decent enough to share with everyone.

807
01:01:58,442 --> 01:02:00,966
Rym: It'll be pretty bad Over all things considered.

808
01:02:01,508 --> 01:02:03,234
Scott: It'll sound like an office teleconference.

809
01:02:03,535 --> 01:02:04,680
Rym: I mean generally what we did.

810
01:02:05,023 --> 01:02:06,700
Rym: I think the best will just what we did last night.

811
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:10,514
Rym: We had a whole bunch of people trying to be on our show and we only had three.

812
01:02:10,875 --> 01:02:15,450
Rym: see there are two kinds of microphones Basically, they're omni directional and uni directional.

813
01:02:16,112 --> 01:02:20,967
Rym: now an omni directional mic records the same Volume from any direction.

814
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:24,320
Rym: so you stick it in the middle of four people and they can just all kind of talk at it.

815
01:02:24,461 --> 01:02:28,946
Rym: Or you hand it to someone and if they don't know how to hold a microphone It doesn't matter how they're holding it.

816
01:02:28,986 --> 01:02:29,909
Rym: They'll still sound the same.

817
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:33,380
Rym: The problem is it picks up all the noise in the room.

818
01:02:33,581 --> 01:02:36,258
Rym: so if someone's you know fiddling with something in the corner, it'll pick that up too.

819
01:02:36,278 --> 01:02:41,340
Rym: and Unidirectional mics really only pick up sound from essentially one direction.

820
01:02:41,501 --> 01:02:46,860
Rym: So you have to point it very specifically at yourself in a certain way And it won't pick up any noise.

821
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:53,292
Rym: Like if I had a unidirectional mic and Scott's talking to me Scott wouldn't even get picked up on the mic, but I would be picked up perfectly.

822
01:02:53,312 --> 01:02:55,099
Scott: These are unidirectional.

823
01:02:55,119 --> 01:03:01,580
Scott: So if I But if it was omni directional you'd still be able to hear me if I was like this side of it.

824
01:03:02,123 --> 01:03:10,280
Rym: So what we did is we had the three unidirectional mics and we gave those two I guess the three people we thought were the coolest or whoever had the best voices and then everyone else.

825
01:03:10,701 --> 01:03:16,944
Rym: We just stuck one omni directional mic and we recorded that on a separate track Because it was so noisy.

826
01:03:17,406 --> 01:03:21,440
Rym: and then what I can do in post-production now is the three people on the good mics.

827
01:03:21,581 --> 01:03:29,274
Rym: I just throw them in and then I only bring in the track from the other omni directional mic When people on that track are talking and otherwise I quash it out.

828
01:03:29,334 --> 01:03:39,100
Rym: so no the noise comes through In terms of dealing with a bunch of people as in terms of who talks when You just have to designate someone as the moderator.

829
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:42,874
Rym: I mean we had I basically did the whole first roundtable.

830
01:03:42,894 --> 01:03:44,300
Rym: we did Scott wasn't in the room so much.

831
01:03:44,703 --> 01:03:46,640
Rym: So I moderated the whole thing, you know, I asked people questions.

832
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:48,587
Rym: I would cut people off if they were talking too long.

833
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:51,879
Rym: then when we did the thing where you know, the assassination attempt occurred.

834
01:03:53,793 --> 01:03:55,200
Rym: We Scott we were tired.

835
01:03:55,280 --> 01:04:01,174
Rym: So Scott and I just kind of did it and there's really no true moderator and it kind of descended into chaos until we got shot.

836
01:04:02,962 --> 01:04:06,120
Rym: But in general it if you ever want to have a whole bunch of people recorded.

837
01:04:06,562 --> 01:04:13,772
Rym: Someone needs to be the moderator someone you everyone needs to agree that they will take that person's direction No matter what they say until the recording stops.

838
01:04:14,133 --> 01:04:18,460
Scott: Yeah, I mean some podcasts, you know Don't have a moderator and everyone's polite and they know each other.

839
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:20,990
Scott: So they know, you know only talk at once.

840
01:04:21,071 --> 01:04:27,079
Scott: if people are interrupting each other or talking over each other It becomes unlistenable because you know one person just keep talking over each other.

841
01:04:27,202 --> 01:04:30,994
Scott: Yeah Well one person is this loud and another person is exactly as loud.

842
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:35,126
Scott: if they both talk at the same time It gets double loud and not good.

843
01:04:37,632 --> 01:04:38,073
Rym: I can't believe.

844
01:04:38,093 --> 01:04:38,914
Rym: that's all the questions.

845
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:39,295
Rym: No.

846
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:40,278
Scott: No, I've got the mic.

847
01:04:41,019 --> 01:04:46,480
Rym: Ah Understand that hosting and the RSS feed is basically an art form.

848
01:04:46,701 --> 01:04:51,520
Scott: Constantly developing sounds like two of you are having far more fun than should be allowed.

849
01:04:51,922 --> 01:04:54,679
Scott: Did you share with us some of your experiences with that?

850
01:04:55,900 --> 01:05:07,140
Scott: Okay, what I do is we have hosting from a company called line ode which is not for the faint of heart If you cannot administer a Linux system on your own do not get a line ode.

851
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:19,364
Scott: But I have a line ode because I can do that and what I did is install the patchy the web server PHP, you know the programming language system and WordPress WordPress.

852
01:05:19,564 --> 01:05:27,339
Scott: if you make a blog post in WordPress and you link to an mp3 It will automatically make the RSS feed and the enclosure and do everything for you.

853
01:05:27,922 --> 01:05:34,900
Scott: If you don't want to you can go to wordpress.com and get your own WordPress blog But your URL is going to be something dot wordpress.com.

854
01:05:35,742 --> 01:05:44,419
Scott: Then what we did is you need special things in your feed for iTunes to recognize it because iTunes is screwed up And they like to do their own thing.

855
01:05:45,265 --> 01:05:58,191
Scott: so if you want iTunes and Apple to recognize You know all the information about your podcast and you want them to put your podcast in their directory properly You need to add all this stuff to your feed Which there's two ways you can do it.

856
01:05:58,252 --> 01:06:02,858
Scott: if you're using WordPress number one you can get a WordPress plug-in that allows you to do it.

857
01:06:02,878 --> 01:06:05,460
Scott: or You can use feed burner.

858
01:06:05,661 --> 01:06:06,664
Scott: What feed burner does?

859
01:06:06,684 --> 01:06:10,096
Scott: is they provide a service where you give them an RSS feed.

860
01:06:10,116 --> 01:06:10,878
Scott: then they?

861
01:06:11,642 --> 01:06:20,131
Scott: Tidy up your RSS feed into something perfect And then you share the feed burner feed with everyone because you know that one always works Just fine, and that's that's what we do.

862
01:06:20,533 --> 01:06:20,674
Rym: Yeah.

863
01:06:20,715 --> 01:06:21,480
Rym: They're very good.

864
01:06:21,621 --> 01:06:27,038
Rym: I mean, I'd say I'm not quite the majority of podcasts now Or it's moving to feed burner just because it's so easy.

865
01:06:27,802 --> 01:06:34,050
Rym: I mean like we're Linux admins and all that and dealing with email is such a pain that we just use Gmail And it's kind of the same deal.

866
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:35,399
Rym: It's a pain to deal with RSS.

867
01:06:36,221 --> 01:06:40,120
Rym: So if you just use feed burner they take over everything for you, and you don't have to worry about all that.

868
01:06:40,342 --> 01:06:44,628
Scott: There are a lot of people out there who are scarily Manually editing their RSS feeds.

869
01:06:44,768 --> 01:06:48,220
Scott: if you're manually editing your RSS feed you are doing something wrong.

870
01:06:48,321 --> 01:06:54,300
Scott: You should have a piece of software that is doing that for you automatically Or else I don't know why you're wasting your time.

871
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:59,059
Rym: Yeah I mean the RSS exists to make podcasting or anything like this easier to do not harder to do.

872
01:06:59,842 --> 01:07:06,380
Scott: And as for the hosting there are a lot more companies now used to be just Libsyn really But now there's a whole bunch of competitors.

873
01:07:06,581 --> 01:07:22,486
Scott: I think that pod show company has something and there's a few others and The way they seem to work for podcasts is you can upload so many megabytes of podcasts per month and then infinity downloads Which is which is good because you know if you get a hundred million listeners all of a sudden You don't want to be screwed.

874
01:07:22,888 --> 01:07:25,080
Rym: Yep, and they keep your archives as long as you keep paying them.

875
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:26,452
Rym: so everything stays up forever.

876
01:07:26,472 --> 01:07:32,300
Rym: and All told we spend about a hundred and twenty dollars a month on all of our hosting.

877
01:07:32,621 --> 01:07:39,502
Scott: Yeah, I think our Libsyn is 40 bucks and the line out hosting is 80 bucks But in terms of anyone else out there I mean one.

878
01:07:39,803 --> 01:07:47,172
Rym: we do four shows a week, and they're all about an hour long - we record pretty high quality and we use 96 kilobits per second.

879
01:07:47,634 --> 01:08:01,860
Rym: for various reasons and For anyone else out there who isn't insane like we are If you do like a weekly or a monthly podcast you could easily get away with spending ten or fifteen dollars a month and be Perfectly fine and ready to go in case you get slashed on it or parked or something.

880
01:08:02,101 --> 01:08:05,260
Scott: Yeah, Libsyn actually provides a total podcasting solution.

881
01:08:05,421 --> 01:08:10,440
Scott: So if you're not doing a whole lot of podcasting you can just pay them and everything will work.

882
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:11,865
Scott: You won't need any other hosts.

883
01:08:11,925 --> 01:08:12,889
Scott: You won't need anything else.

884
01:08:12,929 --> 01:08:15,740
Scott: You'll probably need a domain name from someone, but that's about it.

885
01:08:16,081 --> 01:08:21,979
Rym: I don't personally terribly recommend using Libsyn for that because their technological service is very good.

886
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:30,630
Rym: Their customer support is kind of lacking and if you don't know about the technology and you need help Libsyn generally can't provide it very easily or very well.

887
01:08:31,171 --> 01:08:32,676
Scott: It's sort of like using GarageBand.

888
01:08:32,716 --> 01:08:33,420
Scott: You know it works.

889
01:08:33,761 --> 01:08:37,560
Scott: It's everything in one, but at the same time you can't really do anything with it.

890
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:40,479
Scott: You're trapped inside the noobs world the low end.

891
01:08:41,182 --> 01:08:46,727
Rym: I generally recommend using WordPress in some form either on whatever hosting you already have or WordPress.com.

892
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:50,466
Rym: it's easy to use you'll learn a lot And it's really the best solution.

893
01:08:50,506 --> 01:08:51,169
Rym: as far as I can see.

894
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:55,265
Scott: there are other blog softwares that are just as good like movable Type or type.

895
01:08:55,386 --> 01:08:56,470
Scott: I don't know what they're called.

896
01:08:56,712 --> 01:08:58,139
Scott: I don't use them, but they're out there.

897
01:09:00,082 --> 01:09:00,344
Scott: Hey guys.

898
01:09:00,365 --> 01:09:02,076
Scott: Hey, what's up um?

899
01:09:02,899 --> 01:09:06,009
Scott: By podcast we use Skype and Audacity.

900
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:19,676
Scott: simply because one of our new one of our hosts is in England and The other programs don't work so well over there We're running into a problem rather severe problem where two of us there are four of us total.

901
01:09:19,796 --> 01:09:28,663
Scott: two of us sound great The other two sound awful, and if we put it into a car they become unhearable There.

902
01:09:29,145 --> 01:09:32,138
Rym: it's always twos with us apparently, but there are two things that cause that.

903
01:09:33,261 --> 01:09:41,555
Rym: Early on we record everything where we can coded everything to 64 kilobit per second mp3s which is pretty much as low as you would ever want to go for voice.

904
01:09:41,575 --> 01:09:48,218
Rym: and Because of the way our levels are we didn't realize that you know listening to our masters everything that I mean.

905
01:09:48,238 --> 01:10:04,133
Rym: it sounded pretty good to us, but then one of our listeners told us one day that in the car we sound like two robots killing each other and Those are basically the artifacts from encoding something to an mp3 or in skype's case What skype uses to compress the audio to send it across.

906
01:10:04,816 --> 01:10:05,700
Rym: the best solution?

907
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:11,680
Rym: I mean in terms of encoding you can't do much about Skype because Skype changes how it encodes depend on your bandwidth.

908
01:10:12,143 --> 01:10:14,699
Rym: So there's nothing you can do about that except buy more bandwidth.

909
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:26,000
Rym: in Terms of dealing with the fact that they sound bad the best thing you can really do is have them on two separate tracks and Then do a separate set of filters to the bad sounding one to try to smooth it out a little.

910
01:10:26,261 --> 01:10:29,000
Scott: Yeah, also two guys sound bad and two guys sound fine.

911
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,628
Scott: There's probably something wrong with their end.

912
01:10:30,668 --> 01:10:32,960
Scott: Maybe they have a sound card with a lot of noise on it.

913
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:35,128
Scott: Maybe they didn't set their levels properly.

914
01:10:35,469 --> 01:10:38,480
Rym: I think it sounds like his problem is very specifically an encoding issue.

915
01:10:38,741 --> 01:10:42,536
Rym: Yeah, because that kind of noise really only comes up when you're compressing something.

916
01:10:42,557 --> 01:10:45,605
Scott: all right MP3 before you upload.

917
01:10:46,027 --> 01:10:49,780
Scott: you should probably upload all the waves and combine them and make an MP.

918
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,889
Rym: You never want to transcode anything.

919
01:10:51,929 --> 01:10:52,673
Rym: I mean real.

920
01:10:52,693 --> 01:10:55,628
Rym: briefly in case anyone isn't fully aware of this There are two ways always two.

921
01:10:56,333 --> 01:11:04,258
Rym: you can encode audio losslessly like in flack or essentially a wave file where it's perfect or an mp3 where it's small because it's lossy.

922
01:11:04,358 --> 01:11:05,582
Rym: information is Destroyed.

923
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:09,092
Rym: if you encode something to mp3 some information is lost.

924
01:11:09,694 --> 01:11:13,108
Rym: if you encode that to an mp3 again More is lost.

925
01:11:13,550 --> 01:11:17,027
Rym: so if you encode to mp3 upload it And then he makes an mp3 from that.

926
01:11:17,449 --> 01:11:25,388
Rym: that is probably where almost all of your problems are coming from Especially if he's using a bitrate less than 96 It's just like if you ever use Photoshop.

927
01:11:25,408 --> 01:11:27,756
Scott: you want to do everything in what the PSD format.

928
01:11:27,796 --> 01:11:32,460
Scott: that is completely lossless Until the very last minute you make your JPEG or your paying or your gift.

929
01:11:32,922 --> 01:11:33,423
Scott: It's the same thing.

930
01:11:33,443 --> 01:11:38,983
Scott: you want to keep everything as a wave file, or if you're using an Apple they have those lossless Files.

931
01:11:39,023 --> 01:11:45,420
Scott: yeah, whatever they're called you want to make everything you know lossless until the very last minute you make your mp3 or your AAC.

932
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:47,123
Scott: Anyone else?

933
01:11:47,785 --> 01:11:52,581
Rym: we're almost out of time, so I have a question about the new video Podcasts.

934
01:11:52,902 --> 01:11:57,059
Rym: I know you guys aren't too involved, but I'm guessing that you know more than most.

935
01:11:57,361 --> 01:12:00,477
Rym: We've been debating doing it and the only limiting factor is money.

936
01:12:00,518 --> 01:12:04,674
Rym: at this point The only video podcast I watch is ask a ninja.

937
01:12:05,176 --> 01:12:07,216
Scott: Yeah, I mean Think of it.

938
01:12:07,843 --> 01:12:13,320
Scott: I'm listening to the audio podcast because while I work I'm a computer programmer so I could sit in work and listen at the same time.

939
01:12:13,421 --> 01:12:14,689
Scott: It was a video podcast.

940
01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:16,400
Scott: you know I'd have to stop work.

941
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:21,330
Rym: Yeah, I mean I work in the Bronx, and I live an hour north of it So I drive to work an hour one way every day.

942
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:23,460
Rym: I can listen to podcasts in the car just fine.

943
01:12:24,043 --> 01:12:25,471
Rym: I can't watch a movie in the car.

944
01:12:25,491 --> 01:12:25,632
Rym: Well.

945
01:12:25,692 --> 01:12:26,396
Rym: I can but it's fine.

946
01:12:26,416 --> 01:12:29,684
Rym: I have a good idea But in turn I mean it.

947
01:12:30,066 --> 01:12:36,352
Rym: video podcasting is really I don't think going to take off soon because It's really just the barrier to entry and the amount of effort.

948
01:12:36,814 --> 01:12:42,084
Rym: I mean think you've got blogging podcasts video casts and Blogging.

949
01:12:42,104 --> 01:12:43,579
Rym: the barrier to entry is really small.

950
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:45,166
Rym: I mean blogs are free.

951
01:12:45,628 --> 01:12:48,720
Rym: all you have to do is type whenever it takes almost no effort.

952
01:12:48,801 --> 01:12:50,794
Rym: Just type whatever you want audio now.

953
01:12:50,815 --> 01:12:51,600
Rym: You know this equipment.

954
01:12:51,741 --> 01:12:52,806
Rym: You need to learn about audio.

955
01:12:52,826 --> 01:13:03,939
Rym: you need to actually sit down and record the audio Usually late at night when I need to go to bed because I've worked in the morning And Pardon me now, and you have to worry about the noise in the room and all that video.

956
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:13,171
Rym: now You also have to worry about lighting about bandwidth about makeup about all these other things, and it's just it becomes an Exponentially increasing amount of effort.

957
01:13:13,292 --> 01:13:18,474
Scott: yeah, I mean with audio You know the mp3 is gonna work on everyone's computer pretty much if you use video.

958
01:13:18,494 --> 01:13:21,972
Scott: you got to worry about the mpeg 4s What's it called the h.264?

959
01:13:23,284 --> 01:13:24,730
Scott: And the iPod formats.

960
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:30,613
Scott: at the PSP formats the Divix the expid There's so many different video formats the QuickTime the windows media.

961
01:13:31,236 --> 01:13:33,468
Scott: It's really just a pain in the butt I think.

962
01:13:33,488 --> 01:13:34,758
Rym: maybe give it three or four years.

963
01:13:34,798 --> 01:13:39,299
Rym: video Podcasting is bandwidth increases as long as you know the internet isn't made up of a series of tubes.

964
01:13:41,541 --> 01:13:48,039
Scott: Yeah as digital cameras get cheaper and as Google turns on more dark fiber you're gonna see a lot more video podcasting.

965
01:13:50,071 --> 01:13:53,190
Scott: All right, I think we're out of time anyway, so we're not on time just yet.

966
01:13:53,351 --> 01:13:54,115
Rym: We got to wind down.

967
01:13:54,498 --> 01:13:56,530
Rym: Yeah, I don't think we have any more questions.

968
01:13:57,412 --> 01:14:02,907
Rym: I guess at this point everyone who does a podcast come on up here And we'll well yell and scream and be if someone will take a picture.

969
01:14:04,971 --> 01:14:05,473
Scott: Make a line.

970
01:14:06,014 --> 01:14:09,184
Rym: come on up as long as you actually do a podcast.

971
01:14:09,204 --> 01:14:10,047
Rym: I'll know if you're lying.

972
01:14:10,669 --> 01:14:10,970
Rym: I'll know.

973
01:14:15,711 --> 01:14:18,563
Rym: And there are no freaking clown pistols allowed up here.

974
01:14:19,327 --> 01:14:22,694
Scott: good God Oh We should pimp ourselves first.

975
01:14:23,096 --> 01:14:24,140
Rym: Oh, yeah once again.

976
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:24,943
Rym: I'm Rym.

977
01:14:25,124 --> 01:14:28,037
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights Front row crew.

978
01:14:28,359 --> 01:14:29,927
Rym: calm we got fires for everyone.

979
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:30,470
Scott: Yeah, we do it.

980
01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:31,194
Scott: We have a flyer.

981
01:14:31,234 --> 01:14:35,458

1018
01:17:04,209 --> 01:17:06,487

1024
01:17:25,797 --> 01:17:34,650
Rym: See I didn't really warn him But you learn a lot about audio and the first thing you'll learn when you start doing live shows anywhere Is that you never walk in front of those big things because they'll hurt you.
