1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,758
Scott: It's Thursday December 7th.

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,950
Scott: I'm Scott and I'm Rym and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,850
Scott: We discuss gift giving and receiving.

4
00:00:19,932 --> 00:00:20,965
Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:23,283 --> 00:00:33,000
Rym: Well seeing is how the first annual GeekNights Well, not really geek guys, but front row crew holiday party hosted by the Macross is is happening this weekend.

6
00:00:33,482 --> 00:00:40,359
Rym: Scott and I went out to buy our gifts for the secret Santa that is being run and boy Did we get some awesome shit?

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,059
Rym: Yeah I mean driving up the road.

8
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:51,916
Rym: You know on our way cuz we have to when we decide to go Consumering as opposed to just our normal shopping, you know Like going to the mall or go into those stores that sell coffee in addition to whatever they have.

9
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:52,880
Rym: It's a deal.

10
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:53,647
Rym: It's a big deal.

11
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:54,858
Rym: Like we get ready we go.

12
00:00:55,503 --> 00:00:58,420
Rym: We venture out into consumer land with all the appropriate weapons.

13
00:00:58,801 --> 00:01:06,200
Rym: We shield ourselves from the horrible radiation of edge with our eyes and you know as we were driving up We didn't really know what to get.

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:16,913
Rym: we were kind of really at a loss as we'll talk about during the main bit, but once we got to a store and We started seeing items we could purchase and ways we could combine them.

15
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:20,627
Scott: It really started to click Yeah on the way up.

16
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:23,160
Scott: We said hey, why don't we go and check out that place?

17
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,411
Scott: We hadn't been to in a while.

18
00:01:24,431 --> 00:01:25,380
Scott: or how about that place?

19
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,349
Scott: You know because we got the road we want to.

20
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,077
Scott: it takes a while to get up there like 10-15 minutes.

21
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:35,340
Scott: So we want to make sure that if there's someplace to go up there We go there all at once to make as few trips as possible.

22
00:01:36,064 --> 00:01:38,117
Scott: And I don't think we're going back up there for a while.

23
00:01:38,137 --> 00:01:38,197
Scott: god.

24
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,447
Rym: No, not until after the new year at least.

25
00:01:40,627 --> 00:01:44,040
Rym: I will not go anywhere near a mall from this point forward me either.

26
00:01:44,361 --> 00:01:54,917
Rym: But not only do I have my secret Santa collection, but I have an entire Presentation ready as I will unveil each item and explain its purpose.

27
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:59,514
Scott: Wow I I just got some really awesome stuff and I'm not gonna make a present.

28
00:01:59,535 --> 00:02:06,979
Rym: Scott stuff is pretty awesome And I hope that whoever gets it will allow us to use some of it in some way for a future.

29
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:07,380
Rym: awesome.

30
00:02:08,601 --> 00:02:17,020
Scott: I just hope whoever gets it appreciates it because I know some people would appreciate that sort of thing and be like ah Yeah, and some people would be like WTF mate.

31
00:02:17,483 --> 00:02:30,735
Rym: Well, you know it's like at my work when I worked at IBM We did a secret Santa thing for the department holiday party which actually that was a really good time hanging out with those people and I Gave see a lot of people really like alcohol there.

32
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:35,520
Rym: So I got a bunch of Alcohol, but not really there was actually no alcohol.

33
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,820
Rym: There were old wine and liquor bottles filled with water hidden in a bag.

34
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:42,160
Rym: So it was obvious that it was liquor, but it wasn't really liquor.

35
00:02:43,343 --> 00:02:45,257
Rym: And hidden inside was an anime DVD.

36
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:49,360
Rym: The guy you got it was kind of pissed.

37
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:54,800
Scott: So in other words you were guaranteed to give anime to the biggest alcoholic there something like that.

38
00:02:55,861 --> 00:03:07,490
Rym: Well, of course the other guy who knows a bit about geekery and all that who actually ended up with the anime DVD his gift was actually The Star Wars Christmas special in the Ewok adventure.

39
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,552
Scott: He is the winner.

40
00:03:08,573 --> 00:03:11,099
Rym: I don't think anyone realized why that was funny except me.

41
00:03:12,543 --> 00:03:14,276
Scott: I'm sure they did once they tried to watch it.

42
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,490
Rym: God I watched the Ewok adventure on TV.

43
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,554
Rym: Wow.

44
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,438
Rym: Have you ever seen it?

45
00:03:21,563 --> 00:03:22,828
Scott: Kind of it's just.

46
00:03:22,948 --> 00:03:24,113
Scott: I know what it looks like.

47
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,418
Rym: It looks like he walks.

48
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,793
Rym: Yes And kids have an adventure.

49
00:03:27,814 --> 00:03:32,730
Rym: Yeah Yeah, so anyway, I'll let Scott do his news first.

50
00:03:33,252 --> 00:03:35,940
Scott: My news should have been a thing of the day, but it's Thursday.

51
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,648
Scott: So you're basically getting two things of the day.

52
00:03:38,668 --> 00:03:47,674
Rym: Yeah, we had two news isn't two things of the day, but then Scott Discovered another thing of the day and there was no way to delay this.

53
00:03:47,774 --> 00:03:56,160
Rym: and in fact, I will say right now To anyone in the front row crew and extended front row crew is going to be at the Macross holiday extravaganza this weekend.

54
00:03:56,762 --> 00:04:07,020
Rym: You will not say a word about Scott's thing of the day to anyone Unless you know that they have listened to this episode of GeekNights because I imagine we are going to attempt this.

55
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,260
Rym: But anyway, Scott can do his news first.

56
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,075
Scott: Yeah, my news is apparently in Toronto where you do not want to go.

57
00:04:14,236 --> 00:04:15,660
Rym: I don't want to go to Toronto.

58
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,204
Scott: I don't want to go.

59
00:04:17,445 --> 00:04:18,589
Rym: children do not have faces.

60
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:19,873
Rym: They have cigarette ads.

61
00:04:20,113 --> 00:04:20,474
Scott: Yes.

62
00:04:20,615 --> 00:04:21,999
Scott: It is a bad place.

63
00:04:24,503 --> 00:04:29,700
Scott: And that tax on wicker goods, yes, I do not want to tax on my wicker good so I will not go to Toronto.

64
00:04:29,944 --> 00:04:49,242
Scott: I do not want this Unless it is this one specific case in which I would go to Toronto where they have not 100 not 200 250 no, but 1,200 people playing capture the flag downtown In

65
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:50,947
Rym: in the streets running around

66
00:04:51,468 --> 00:04:55,520
Scott: as in exactly in the streets running around like lunatics.

67
00:04:56,307 --> 00:04:59,453
Rym: that sounds like unmitigated awesome.

68
00:05:00,118 --> 00:05:02,931
Scott: it Appears to be unmitigated awesome.

69
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:04,860
Scott: It looks like unmitigated awesome.

70
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:13,900
Scott: The idea is unmitigated awesome and for some people like us it would be unmitigated awesome But in reality it is mostly a fucking mess.

71
00:05:14,641 --> 00:05:20,682
Rym: Yeah, but it's that good kind of mess that involves the crowds of people out in the street who aren't rioting Exactly.

72
00:05:20,722 --> 00:05:26,804
Rym: I mean if you see a crowd of people in the street like a big crowd of people standing on cars yelling Especially in the u.s.

73
00:05:26,824 --> 00:05:31,519
Rym: Setting fires to cars tipping them over odds are any group of people that's yelling is trouble.

74
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:41,140
Rym: Seeing a group of people yelling that not only was not trouble but was in fact Anti trouble at least as far as I'm concerned probably not as far as the authorities were concerned.

75
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:47,800
Scott: Yeah, either way capture the flag is awesome for many reasons and we should do a whole episode on capture the flag because I could.

76
00:05:48,442 --> 00:05:53,260
Scott: Yeah, all I'm gonna say is that I'm watching this video and I'm looking at their rules for capture the flag.

77
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,477
Scott: You know, you can only have five people guarding the flag, etc, etc.

78
00:05:57,784 --> 00:05:59,895
Scott: They didn't have the best rules for a 1,200 man game.

79
00:06:01,081 --> 00:06:05,060
Rym: They probably didn't put that much thought into it compared to the amount of thought that should have been put into it.

80
00:06:05,521 --> 00:06:14,549
Scott: This was actually, you know, it was probably a better flash mob an idea that it was a game of capture the flag And I can't really blame them for that.

81
00:06:14,589 --> 00:06:17,980
Rym: Well capture the flag in its purest form Really?

82
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:35,451
Rym: I mean unless you modify the rules or Do something fun like full contact or make the rules very clear and codified as to what constitutes someone being captured and Exactly what you have to do to get the flag and all those sorts of things The game ends up being a very arbitrary messive.

83
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:36,415
Rym: I got you.

84
00:06:36,615 --> 00:06:37,238
Rym: now you didn't.

85
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:42,434
Scott: yeah The best catch of the flag ever played was at summer camp, but that's a story for another time.

86
00:06:42,494 --> 00:06:52,197
Scott: Yeah, I'll tell summer camp was fascist about its capture the flag which Ironically was called revolution and they play it on the 4th of July every year.

87
00:06:52,217 --> 00:06:58,360
Rym: Ooh Yeah, we played a lot at band camp and when I was a Cub Scout at a Boy Scout camp once that ended it.

88
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,328
Rym: Well, we'll tell those stories on another day.

89
00:07:00,348 --> 00:07:00,408
Scott: Yes.

90
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:03,260
Scott: Yeah along with some dodgeballs.

91
00:07:03,843 --> 00:07:07,180
Rym: Now the sad thing is it said well, I guess it's good for Canada.

92
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:15,739
Rym: It says a lot about the people of Toronto even though their children have cigarette ads instead of faces They all wear three-piece suits and they carry black balloons.

93
00:07:16,241 --> 00:07:29,086
Rym: But in Toronto the fact that this flash mob happened and the riot squad didn't appear I mean this shit would not go down in the US if you tried to get this together on the streets of New York or LA or Detroit

94
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:33,827
Scott: not in a smaller city like a Rochester or Buffalo.

95
00:07:33,847 --> 00:07:44,560
Rym: police would be there in a second and even if they didn't bust heads thinking it was a riot They would probably cite you for creating a public nuisance or a danger or there'd be liability issues.

96
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,764
Rym: You'd all get sued.

97
00:07:45,824 --> 00:07:57,974
Scott: I can almost guarantee that someone would be in jail not prison not prison But jail like in the police station overnight for a few hours Yeah, I would pretty much put the odds of that at a hundred to zero.

98
00:07:58,094 --> 00:08:06,758
Rym: yeah so I can use the nullity Right Cuz I got some actual news here.

99
00:08:07,522 --> 00:08:25,475
Rym: so a lot of us in the IT and CS world and basically a lot of people in the corporate world have realized that for the most part the corporate world is a scam in that your job performance is Generally tied to how many hours you work and how many asses you kiss as opposed to how good you are.

100
00:08:25,936 --> 00:08:42,398
Rym: Yes now doubly, so is the problem that let's say you're really really good at your job and They would give you an assignment that they assume would take I don't know 16 hours to and some and change full working days to complete.

101
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:48,000
Rym: now Let's say you're an intellectual powerhouse and you complete that job in a half hour.

102
00:08:48,562 --> 00:09:00,040
Rym: Now in the current corporate world your options at this point if you don't have other projects to work on is to Sit there and look busy because if they know that you're not working, they'll think you're a slacker.

103
00:09:00,161 --> 00:09:01,860
Rym: They won't think oh, I should give him more work.

104
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:11,402
Rym: They'll just think you're a slacker and if you leave early, they'll probably fire you Mm-hmm now and if you start doing things that aren't work, hey, they'll fire you Yep.

105
00:09:11,683 --> 00:09:14,680
Rym: Now a lot of companies handle this in better ways like IBM where I worked.

106
00:09:15,123 --> 00:09:17,500
Rym: It was it wasn't full flex time or anything.

107
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:23,880
Rym: But there was generally this sense of show up when you need to leave when you need to if you get your work done.

108
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:24,466
Rym: That's great.

109
00:09:24,588 --> 00:09:25,679
Rym: And that's all we care about.

110
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,089
Rym: So you work long hours when long hours were needed.

111
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:30,999
Rym: you leave early when you've done everything and there's nothing to do.

112
00:09:31,602 --> 00:09:40,820
Rym: Some companies take it a lot further and say that you can work whatever Hours you want at any time during the week as long as you put in your 40 hours over the course of the week.

113
00:09:41,502 --> 00:09:52,360
Rym: Best buy of all companies has taken this perhaps to the most awesome extent It could be taken and I will wait anxiously for the results of this widespread social experiment.

114
00:09:52,481 --> 00:09:55,320
Rym: You see in their corporate headquarters, they're experimenting.

115
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:04,735
Rym: Apparently they've been doing this on different scales for some time with total flex time Not even work whenever you want as long as you get your 40 hours in it's purely.

116
00:10:05,136 --> 00:10:06,500
Rym: you have a list of tasks.

117
00:10:06,963 --> 00:10:08,251
Rym: Complete these tasks.

118
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:15,797
Rym: That is all Wow, so if you decide to work, you know 12 hours Monday and Wednesday.

119
00:10:15,897 --> 00:10:16,800
Rym: get all your work done.

120
00:10:17,182 --> 00:10:24,136
Rym: Maybe you show up Friday morning for a meeting once a week And other than that, you don't work as long as you're completing all the tasks you're assigned.

121
00:10:24,637 --> 00:10:25,220
Rym: They don't care.

122
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:28,099
Rym: In fact, they're heavy with you because all they want is the work.

123
00:10:28,481 --> 00:10:32,635
Rym: They don't care to have you in the office wasting your time and their time doing nothing.

124
00:10:32,876 --> 00:10:37,280
Scott: Yeah, I wouldn't If I had that job, that'd be the best job in the whole world.

125
00:10:37,521 --> 00:10:40,840
Scott: I basically do all the work as quickly as I possibly could working.

126
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,485
Scott: You know reasonable hour days.

127
00:10:42,505 --> 00:10:52,019
Scott: if I couldn't if they gave me more work that I could finish in a few eight hour days You know from working nine to five with an hour lunch break, then there's a problem getting too much work.

128
00:10:52,922 --> 00:11:03,960
Scott: But if I could finish the work, which I bet I could I just wouldn't come back in unless there's a meeting and I'd wear some sort of Emailing mobile device to know if I had to do anything.

129
00:11:04,642 --> 00:11:12,877
Rym: Yeah, I mean that's the one thing I miss about IBM that now that I'm working in other industries I can't really work from home and I can't.

130
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:21,100
Rym: Most of my throughput and output is more dependent upon other people and them actually doing their piece of something than on my awesome.

131
00:11:21,623 --> 00:11:30,599
Rym: I can do all of my work in fairly short order and It would be great if I could just leave work early whenever I wanted but yet still show up when I need to do work.

132
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:41,599
Rym: hmm and Best buy seems to be having a lot of success with this and I don't see too many drawbacks other than Obviously, you'll probably have some people who will scam the system and not do any work.

133
00:11:42,182 --> 00:11:49,435
Scott: You'll obviously have some people who you know You'll quickly realize people who aren't coming in don't have enough work to do.

134
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:55,100
Scott: You'll give them more work You know, which is not the greatest always because you might give them too much work and such.

135
00:11:55,401 --> 00:12:02,179
Rym: Yeah, well the way around that is say you've already got a level of productivity with your current In a I don't know nine to five eight to four hours.

136
00:12:02,942 --> 00:12:06,392
Rym: So you don't ever assign more work than that.

137
00:12:06,613 --> 00:12:08,860
Rym: You already have a baseline that works for your company.

138
00:12:09,302 --> 00:12:15,939
Rym: So by providing the flex time and asking for the same amount of work All you're doing is making happier more productive employees as a whole.

139
00:12:16,722 --> 00:12:20,200
Rym: I'll bet they'll end up doing more work just because they have the freedom.

140
00:12:20,471 --> 00:12:28,880
Rym: Yeah If I knew I could leave work whenever I wanted and show up whenever I wanted I'd be much less averse to pulling late hours when they needed it and just making the time up later.

141
00:12:29,302 --> 00:12:30,870
Scott: Mm-hmm on the other hand though.

142
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,920
Scott: I could see a problem in this system.

143
00:12:33,222 --> 00:12:35,660
Scott: You're really dependent on having your managers be smart.

144
00:12:35,783 --> 00:12:46,380
Scott: for example if we were managed by someone in a system like this and we got all our work done in like Really quickly and the manager was dumb and he sees that we don't show up for two weeks.

145
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,003
Scott: He's like, huh?

146
00:12:47,525 --> 00:12:49,234
Scott: Those guys don't have any work to do.

147
00:12:49,314 --> 00:12:50,580
Scott: I don't have any work for them to do.

148
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,671
Scott: They haven't been here in two weeks.

149
00:12:51,712 --> 00:12:52,480
Scott: What do we need them for?

150
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,059
Scott: Let's fire them and then they've just fired the smartest people there.

151
00:12:55,401 --> 00:13:01,200
Rym: Well, see this what the smart people do is you figure out right away Who the smart people are in your organization?

152
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:11,110
Rym: Who you need to actually care about and who you can ignore and most importantly whether or not your direct report boss is smart or not And you tailor your activities accordingly.

153
00:13:11,451 --> 00:13:13,720
Rym: if they are smart you do exactly what you would have done.

154
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:27,022
Rym: Anyway, if they're not smart you uh pad it out and you finish the work, but you turn it in Way late when it was expected to be turned in and you show up occasionally and pay lip service to the fact that you might Be working.

155
00:13:27,103 --> 00:13:28,610
Scott: Yeah, I just hate having to do shit like that.

156
00:13:28,811 --> 00:13:30,840
Rym: Yeah, but you'd have to do it a lot less under the system.

157
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:31,369
Scott: It's true.

158
00:13:31,674 --> 00:13:34,448
Scott: It's true and you know what the best part is.

159
00:13:34,468 --> 00:13:39,805
Scott: I can actually fucking get shit done like cleaning the house or Doing laundry.

160
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:45,580
Rym: I get the feeling that people who don't do or people have trouble with work.

161
00:13:45,921 --> 00:13:52,525
Rym: You know people who a lot of people who do work at jobs as opposed to people like us Many cases don't have to do so much.

162
00:13:53,026 --> 00:13:56,275
Rym: They actually do need the full 40 hours to do their given job.

163
00:13:56,756 --> 00:13:57,317
Scott: Some people do.

164
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:57,357
Scott: I

165
00:13:58,822 --> 00:14:12,526
Rym: Think most of the people I've worked with in the course of my life have used most of the time Doing the same amount of work I did but they took the full 40 hours and I would usually do it in a lot less time Or they'd be really slow about it.

166
00:14:12,546 --> 00:14:30,599
Rym: Like we need this done and they won't just immediately get out it and finish it right away They'll be like, okay, and then a week later they'll look at it and then a couple days later They'll go out and look at the place They're supposed to do the thing and then they'll go to the water cooler and talk for a while And then they'll just do a voltage of BS and finish the work, you know a month later

167
00:14:31,062 --> 00:14:31,263
Scott: Yeah,

168
00:14:31,684 --> 00:14:31,825
Rym: I'll.

169
00:14:31,865 --> 00:14:34,457
Rym: literally if I'm given an assignment I do it as fast as possible.

170
00:14:34,477 --> 00:14:35,120
Rym: So I'm done with it.

171
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,407
Rym: I don't have to care about it anymore.

172
00:14:36,427 --> 00:14:37,051
Rym: Mm-hmm.

173
00:14:37,674 --> 00:14:38,660
Scott: I wish I had assignments.

174
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:41,531
Rym: Yeah, actually works really ramping up.

175
00:14:41,551 --> 00:14:44,704
Rym: They're starting to give me actual Interesting work to do.

176
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:46,089
Rym: I've been rather pleased with this.

177
00:14:46,249 --> 00:14:56,006
Rym: I hope this trend continues until you finish all the work Yeah, but even when I finish all the work if I ask for more work I've been given it in recent memory You got to be careful.

178
00:14:56,046 --> 00:15:00,920
Scott: if your company just turns into a bunch of people who outsource all the labor You might end up doing the work of the whole company.

179
00:15:01,523 --> 00:15:01,906
Rym: You know what.

180
00:15:01,926 --> 00:15:04,299
Rym: then I'll demand a huge raise because I now have a high truck factor.

181
00:15:04,662 --> 00:15:05,810
Scott: I just demand to be to see.

182
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,280
Scott: you'd be like I do all the work here.

183
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,185
Scott: I should be in charge.

184
00:15:08,245 --> 00:15:08,908
Scott: make me the CEO.

185
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:11,120
Rym: actually the CEO is pretty smart.

186
00:15:11,261 --> 00:15:13,159
Rym: I gotta hand it to him and he's here.

187
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,870
Rym: Honestly, he's a lot smarter than some of the upper management.

188
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,235
Rym: I have met in other companies.

189
00:15:18,295 --> 00:15:18,938
Rym: I've worked for.

190
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:19,540
Scott: that's cool.

191
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:21,020
Rym: So I have no beef with him.

192
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,520
Rym: I wouldn't want to be in charge of the company because I don't know enough about business to do that.

193
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,067
Scott: I'm sure you'd want to make his monies.

194
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:27,112
Rym: Oh, yeah.

195
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:28,660
Rym: Yeah, I'd be happy to be the CIO.

196
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,860
Scott: Yeah, if you made his money's like I could just stop working.

197
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,135
Scott: We could all stop working and we could just podcast all day.

198
00:15:34,376 --> 00:15:35,100
Scott: We had bunnies.

199
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:39,856
Rym: Yeah, or maybe some radio station will pick us up and we'll go pro and that'll be the end of that.

200
00:15:39,976 --> 00:15:52,400
Rym: Well, I You can't do ten atomic sit-ups You don't want to do even one.

201
00:15:53,261 --> 00:15:55,149
Rym: So tell us about your thing of the day Scott.

202
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,640
Scott: Okay, my thing is better than yours, so I should go second.

203
00:15:58,042 --> 00:15:58,927
Rym: Oh, you want me to go first?

204
00:15:59,469 --> 00:16:01,420
Scott: You want to do an atomic sit-up first be my guest.

205
00:16:02,222 --> 00:16:02,886
Scott: I'm not doing any.

206
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:03,410
Rym: so.

207
00:16:03,873 --> 00:16:04,980
Rym: a small town somewhere.

208
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:10,419
Rym: I'm not gonna bore you with all the intimate details of this story because the overall message is the important part.

209
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:17,560
Rym: The basic gist of it is that a town had a backpack mail system where kids going to school.

210
00:16:18,142 --> 00:16:23,220
Rym: They would come home like once a week with a folder with flyers and announcements and stuff from the town.

211
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,309
Rym: You know community groups the city government all those things.

212
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:28,416
Rym: they would send information home with school kids.

213
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:30,383
Scott: when I was in elementary school We did that.

214
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:34,866
Scott: you'd get all kinds of flyers that you would bring home and you know Most of them you just threw out.

215
00:16:34,906 --> 00:16:38,120
Scott: but some of them are important like the Little League sign-up sheet and stuff like that.

216
00:16:38,982 --> 00:16:43,213
Rym: So a long time ago since this town is very small and super Christian and conservative.

217
00:16:43,695 --> 00:17:05,147
Rym: a lot of the church groups got together and along with help from Jerry Falwell's organizations and various groups like that put forth lawsuits and demanded that local churches and local religious groups be able to use this system because it's open to the community as a community service and therefore They shouldn't exclude religious things from that.

218
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:08,579
Rym: the town caved in instead of fighting and just let them do it.

219
00:17:09,201 --> 00:17:09,944
Scott: See our town.

220
00:17:09,964 --> 00:17:13,099
Scott: I don't think religious stuff went out in the school papers.

221
00:17:13,421 --> 00:17:16,010
Rym: Oh, no, but this town allowed it under the guise of free religion.

222
00:17:16,371 --> 00:17:17,053
Scott: All right, whatever.

223
00:17:17,133 --> 00:17:18,036
Rym: That's not the story.

224
00:17:18,518 --> 00:17:27,089
Rym: this year A local pagan group decided to send out their flyer through the thing advertising a Yule Festival.

225
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:35,357
Rym: for anyone who was interested in learning about alternative Cultures and the way they celebrate holidays around Christmas, you know a really cool thing for those types of people.

226
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:41,837
Rym: the Christians in the town are Super super crazily outraged about this.

227
00:17:42,058 --> 00:17:46,907
Rym: Yes So the town came back and said well You're the ones who allow this to happen.

228
00:17:47,288 --> 00:17:49,335
Rym: either all religions get it or none of them.

229
00:17:49,376 --> 00:17:50,500
Rym: Do you decide?

230
00:17:51,801 --> 00:17:53,230
Rym: Huzzah, and that's it.

231
00:17:53,331 --> 00:17:54,680
Rym: I just find it utterly hilarious.

232
00:17:55,062 --> 00:17:59,400
Rym: It is not often that you see someone so duly and dutifully hoisted by their own petard.

233
00:17:59,702 --> 00:18:06,347
Scott: We should need to send out some atheist flyers home with the kiddies Except our town doesn't do anything like that.

234
00:18:06,548 --> 00:18:07,371
Rym: So we don't have to worry.

235
00:18:07,793 --> 00:18:08,837
Rym: We already won that battle.

236
00:18:09,018 --> 00:18:09,519
Rym: Hooray.

237
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:29,420
Scott: Anyway, so I had never before today heard of that which is known as the atomic sit-up and I am sorry That I have not for if I had learned it many years before if I mean if I had learned this in middle school There are probably like a hundred opportunities in my life to do this to people who wouldn't have known what was coming

238
00:18:29,862 --> 00:18:30,586
Rym: God and it

239
00:18:30,606 --> 00:18:35,400
Scott: would have been the most hilarious thing ever because I would have been the guy Who does the atomic sit-up to people?

240
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,000
Rym: It's almost as bad as the guys in my high school who got people to do the elephant dance all the time.

241
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:40,964
Scott: Where's the elephant dance?

242
00:18:41,447 --> 00:18:44,380
Rym: The elephant dance is too complicated to explain without diagrams.

243
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,954
Scott: All right, as long as it's not as bad as the cookie we can let it go.

244
00:18:48,974 --> 00:18:50,097
Rym: It's nothing like that.

245
00:18:50,418 --> 00:18:59,380
Rym: All right, so Before Scott goes on I just want to say again to any front row crew members and friends We're going to be at the Macross party.

246
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:11,959
Rym: Don't mention to anyone what an atomic sit-up is or act like, you know, and like it's not a big deal Because depending on the crowd and the circumstances we might attempt this.

247
00:19:12,481 --> 00:19:16,814
Scott: It'll probably require some people to be slightly intoxicated, but that will just make it better.

248
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:18,620
Rym: It's Scott Johnson Scott.

249
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,865
Rym: Yeah, he's not even gonna be there.

250
00:19:20,066 --> 00:19:20,528
Scott: No, he's not.

251
00:19:20,568 --> 00:19:20,729
Scott: Huh?

252
00:19:21,171 --> 00:19:31,956
Scott: So the I will describe to you now What an atomic sit-up is and you will watch this College humor video to get the full effect of just how hilarious this can be.

253
00:19:32,097 --> 00:19:32,960
Rym: you can't do ten of them.

254
00:19:33,523 --> 00:19:34,006
Scott: No, you can't.

255
00:19:34,751 --> 00:19:36,240
Scott: this is how you do an atomic sit-up.

256
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:36,661
Scott: You're ready.

257
00:19:37,002 --> 00:19:47,478
Scott: first you find someone who is reasonably athletic and wants to take a dare, you know in this video They use military man, and you say I bet you can't do an atomic sit-up.

258
00:19:47,538 --> 00:19:49,304
Scott: and they go What's an atomic sit-up?

259
00:19:49,465 --> 00:19:51,611
Scott: and you can't eat a hundred peeps exactly.

260
00:19:52,173 --> 00:20:00,425
Scott: and you say this is what you tell them that All they have to do is do a sit-up while you hold their head down to the ground with like a towel over their Eyes or something like that.

261
00:20:00,686 --> 00:20:06,097
Scott: All right or a pillow on their faces, you know, not suffocating them Just like the top of their head and they you know.

262
00:20:06,681 --> 00:20:08,287
Scott: so you get them lying on the ground.

263
00:20:08,768 --> 00:20:18,834
Scott: you make sure they put their arms down on the ground and their knees are up and You hold their feet down like they're gonna do a sit-up and then you take a towel or a t-shirt And you put it over their eyes and you hold their head against the ground.

264
00:20:18,894 --> 00:20:19,095
Scott: right.

265
00:20:19,256 --> 00:20:19,919
Rym: so far so good.

266
00:20:20,643 --> 00:20:21,990
Scott: Here's the part where you trick them.

267
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:22,372
Scott: You're ready.

268
00:20:22,433 --> 00:20:22,975
Scott: Here's the thing.

269
00:20:23,016 --> 00:20:25,042
Scott: You can't spoil someone.

270
00:20:25,062 --> 00:20:36,740
Scott: a daring person hopefully a fat person fatter the better will stand and Straddle the person laying down and reveal their buttocks in a prime position.

271
00:20:37,781 --> 00:20:48,257
Scott: Then you say alright go and the person will attempt to sit up Not being able to see and you will resist their head with the towel or a t-shirt or whatnot.

272
00:20:48,798 --> 00:21:01,509
Scott: then as Their face is pushing towards the buttocks you release said shirt or towel sending their face into yon crack of doom releasing much hilarity for all.

273
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:07,268
Rym: now the scream of humor and Horror that comes from this group of people.

274
00:21:07,288 --> 00:21:09,374
Scott: what you have is humor and horror.

275
00:21:09,695 --> 00:21:10,457
Scott: both are key.

276
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:14,913
Rym: I Seeing this live is one of my life's minor ambitions.

277
00:21:14,953 --> 00:21:30,578
Rym: now, I agree though I'm going to go one step further and I think that perhaps the perfect thing to add to this is just the barest barest touch of chocolate pudding real chocolate pudding to the affected area so that the person goes.

278
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:38,660
Rym: ah And I realized that instinctually I would reach for my face and wipe it off is kind of a I don't know primitive cleansing measure.

279
00:21:39,282 --> 00:21:51,409
Rym: If I was subject to this joke and I did that and my butt my face touched someone's butt in that manner You know the nose basically going between the cheeks I would immediately grab my nose between my cheeks.

280
00:21:51,810 --> 00:22:03,020
Rym: now if I pulled my hand away from my face and saw Anything that hinted at any sort of contamination of any kind I would probably vomit.

281
00:22:05,661 --> 00:22:06,925
Rym: This is comedy gold.

282
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:08,651
Scott: it is comedy gold.

283
00:22:08,691 --> 00:22:11,159
Scott: indeed college humor is the win.

284
00:22:11,903 --> 00:22:12,286
Rym: I mean what?

285
00:22:12,306 --> 00:22:14,680
Scott: where the atomic sit-up this weekend?

286
00:22:16,161 --> 00:22:16,664
Scott: I hope not.

287
00:22:16,804 --> 00:22:20,219
Scott: I hope there are plenty of people who don't listen to this episode so that we can pull it off.

288
00:22:23,486 --> 00:22:25,491
Rym: Yeah, so anyway our main bit today.

289
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:26,554
Rym: we were inspired.

290
00:22:26,574 --> 00:22:27,637
Rym: I mean we had a whole other thing.

291
00:22:27,657 --> 00:22:31,629
Rym: we were gonna talk about Self-appraisal and how important that is.

292
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:38,495
Rym: now a lot of people are bad at it and now there's scientific evidence Pointing to why people are bad at it, but I'm not gonna talk about that.

293
00:22:38,515 --> 00:22:39,740
Rym: That's too serious and real.

294
00:22:40,241 --> 00:22:48,393
Rym: We're gonna talk about holiday gifts because as we said before we spent the last couple hours seeking out Holiday gifts for a secret Santa.

295
00:22:48,513 --> 00:22:49,520
Rym: that is supposed to be funny.

296
00:22:49,962 --> 00:22:59,479
Scott: Well, I think there's a one thing that I really want to discuss and that Mostly personally is the worst thing that can possibly happen in terms of gifts.

297
00:22:59,499 --> 00:23:02,070
Scott: You see I'm not big on the gifts.

298
00:23:02,151 --> 00:23:06,360
Scott: I mean when I was a kid sure I love getting toys cuz I didn't have money and I you know.

299
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:11,657
Scott: But now I have money and I buy myself almost everything I want so I don't care about gifts so much.

300
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:18,400
Scott: However Almost the worst thing in the world is when someone gets me a gift that I don't want.

301
00:23:18,781 --> 00:23:28,565
Scott: You know cuz I don't want to return it and I hate being dishonest and Saying I like it when I don't because that usually means I'm gonna get more of it And I also.

302
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:29,529
Rym: it's just like.

303
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,260
Scott: I also hate being honest and saying this sucks.

304
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,220
Scott: You suck buying me gifts when someone was trying to do good.

305
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:46,100
Rym: It's just like the old episode of Andy Griffith where aunt B makes her famous pickles and they taste like kerosene Exactly and no one wants to eat him but then and veal feel bad.

306
00:23:46,621 --> 00:23:56,240
Rym: So they decide the solution is to eat all the pickles and act like they love him and eat so many of them That she runs out of pickles and isn't able to enter the pickles in the pickle contest.

307
00:23:56,501 --> 00:24:01,570
Rym: Therefore she's happy that people liked her pickles, but yet no one else is subject to them And then they won't have to eat them ever again.

308
00:24:01,711 --> 00:24:02,295
Scott: So she makes more.

309
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:06,170
Rym: Yes She makes a lot more because they liked him so much exactly.

310
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:09,180
Scott: So what do you do in this situation personally?

311
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:17,000
Scott: I haven't done this yet So I don't know how it'll work out But I'm thinking about taking a policy because it works for my mom.

312
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,530
Scott: Like if you get my mom a gift she doesn't like she'll.

313
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:27,173
Scott: she won't actually be like, oh, I love it She'll be kind of like And no one seems to have a problem with that.

314
00:24:27,254 --> 00:24:27,837
Scott: Maybe that's cuz.

315
00:24:27,857 --> 00:24:28,440
Scott: she's a Jewish mom.

316
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,460
Rym: I was about to say she can get away with it.

317
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:34,800
Scott: It's because she's a Jewish mommy and somehow if you get her a gift she doesn't want it's your fault.

318
00:24:35,123 --> 00:24:37,040
Scott: So I got to try and make people feel like that.

319
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:44,248
Scott: I got to make people feel guilty for getting the bad gift as opposed to Feeling bad when someone gives me the bad gift.

320
00:24:44,308 --> 00:24:45,412
Scott: I got to do the reversal.

321
00:24:45,793 --> 00:24:46,355
Scott: What do you think?

322
00:24:46,717 --> 00:24:51,220
Rym: See honestly That hasn't happened to me in a long time.

323
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,409
Rym: I mean it used to happen occasionally when I was.

324
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,739
Scott: it hasn't happened to me much, but it does happen.

325
00:24:56,301 --> 00:24:58,168
Rym: Well, the thing is gifts have my.

326
00:24:58,348 --> 00:25:04,660
Rym: the way I receive gifts and the way gifts work in my life has changed a lot since I you know moved out of my family's house when I was in high school.

327
00:25:05,222 --> 00:25:10,480
Rym: See now I really generally dislike giving gifts because of a holiday.

328
00:25:10,601 --> 00:25:15,465
Rym: Like I hate it when I'm obligated to give a gift like oh, it's Christmas me I have to get you a gift.

329
00:25:15,645 --> 00:25:23,088
Scott: an arbitrary date on the calendar is not a reason that I should be somehow forced to Give someone money or goods or service.

330
00:25:23,108 --> 00:25:25,797
Rym: that it's more that I get people gifts fairly often.

331
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:26,700
Rym: I like getting people gifts.

332
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,138
Rym: I like buying things that people like or getting someone something that I know they'd like.

333
00:25:30,178 --> 00:25:34,000
Rym: but I Hate it when I have to give a gift when I'm not inspired to give one.

334
00:25:34,161 --> 00:25:44,740
Rym: I don't have a thing in mind already Like if I see something that I know someone's really gonna like and I want to get it for him I just get it like alright, this would be great and it might be like the middle of March.

335
00:25:44,861 --> 00:25:46,859
Rym: I don't know and I just give him this gift like hey check this out.

336
00:25:47,402 --> 00:26:00,203
Rym: But if it's suddenly Christmas and I don't have anything in particular to buy them It seems like anything I get would be hollow Because I kind of just bought it because it was the holiday as opposed to buying it because I knew it was something they really Desired.

337
00:26:00,544 --> 00:26:05,360
Scott: I think that's also partially because the holidays are hollow to us because we don't give a shit about them.

338
00:26:05,761 --> 00:26:17,904
Scott: But to someone who cares about the holidays the gift won't be hollow, you know I mean, it'll still be hollow to us because we'll still feel like it's a gift with nothing But that nothing when they get the gift will be filled with this holiday They care about.

339
00:26:17,964 --> 00:26:18,848
Rym: don't be using the royal.

340
00:26:18,888 --> 00:26:23,271
Rym: we here I as even though, you know, it's super atheist I am I still like Christmas.

341
00:26:23,351 --> 00:26:23,794
Rym: It's a real.

342
00:26:23,814 --> 00:26:24,640
Rym: it's a good time of the year.

343
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:35,580
Rym: it always meant getting together with friends and family and having a good time and eating a lot of food and I don't even mind Christmas gifts, especially in the manner that we are giving gifts this weekend, but we'll talk about that later.

344
00:26:35,707 --> 00:26:46,319
Rym: yeah, well That's something different and like Thanksgiving I celebrate and a few Bert will actually only one Maybe two birthdays do I actually celebrate and no one of them is not my own.

345
00:26:46,921 --> 00:26:48,848
Scott: I'm not really a fan of birthdays either.

346
00:26:48,868 --> 00:27:02,386
Rym: Well, the thing is and this will sound bad, but last year I Honestly forgot about my birthday yeah, and I just went to work and I did all my business and I came home and someone mentioned that was my birthday and I was like what.

347
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,702
Rym: Oh crap it is Like.

348
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:11,139
Rym: once I turned 22, I just stopped paying attention and I often forget within one year how old I am.

349
00:27:11,722 --> 00:27:14,432
Scott: I forgot how old I was for a while like between 23 and 24.

350
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:20,282
Scott: It was like Now I'm currently 24 we're 24.

351
00:27:20,282 --> 00:27:21,406
Scott: We're almost 25.

352
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,050
Rym: I'm gonna be 25 in January.

353
00:27:23,111 --> 00:27:24,234
Scott: I mean 25 in April.

354
00:27:24,274 --> 00:27:24,976
Rym: Yeah, we're young ins.

355
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:26,220
Scott: Not really now.

356
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:27,304
Rym: Yeah, we're pretty young.

357
00:27:27,324 --> 00:27:30,116
Rym: We're only a quarter maybe a third of the way through our life.

358
00:27:30,136 --> 00:27:30,980
Scott: It feels like yesterday.

359
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:36,020
Scott: I was like, ah, there's no way it's gonna be forever until my car insurance gets cheaper.

360
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,268
Scott: Now my car insurance you deeper in like five months.

361
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:41,360
Rym: I feel like like a week ago.

362
00:27:41,882 --> 00:27:45,260
Rym: I was in high school thinking wow, the good days will never end.

363
00:27:45,601 --> 00:27:53,566
Rym: I can't imagine having a real job somewhere or having responsibility and it seems like five minutes ago I was at RIT going.

364
00:27:53,907 --> 00:27:55,254
Rym: these are the best days of my life.

365
00:27:55,314 --> 00:28:00,757
Rym: Fuck if they're ever gonna end Game over.

366
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:04,587
Rym: See that's why we're doing this podcast.

367
00:28:04,848 --> 00:28:05,290
Rym: GeekNights.

368
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,675
Rym: for us is just a continue.

369
00:28:07,077 --> 00:28:13,060
Scott: Yeah, hopefully It's more like putting quarters in a different game because one machine broke.

370
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:15,570
Scott: I thought we could play Dig Dug forever.

371
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,260
Scott: But no now we must play Galaxian.

372
00:28:17,543 --> 00:28:32,100
Rym: Yeah, though to be perfectly honest I would say that my life and probably your life too are just as good as they were in college just in Different ways like some areas on the web graph That is our lives went down and others went up and the same area is covered by the graph.

373
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,299
Scott: I like those other areas better.

374
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:34,502
Scott: Maybe.

375
00:28:34,904 --> 00:28:37,879
Rym: see remember what areas do we have now that we didn't have before?

376
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:43,097
Rym: Lottie money fans every convention we ever wanted to go to?

377
00:28:44,146 --> 00:28:45,618
Scott: No homework.

378
00:28:46,401 --> 00:28:49,258
Rym: Remember as much as we loved college and as awesome as it was.

379
00:28:49,821 --> 00:29:01,139
Rym: Remember though when we paid for all that all that slacking off at the end of the quarter where there would be two weeks straight Of us doing homework and labs, you know, I just really don't remember the homework like everything was easy.

380
00:29:01,861 --> 00:29:04,137
Scott: Anyway, every now and then talk about some gifts some more.

381
00:29:04,258 --> 00:29:08,736
Rym: Yeah But it just it's hard for me to give a gift if I'm not inspired to get a gift like.

382
00:29:08,776 --> 00:29:14,546
Rym: I'll see something and think Wow, that'd be the perfect gift for so-and-so and Then I get it for him.

383
00:29:14,948 --> 00:29:15,169
Scott: Yep.

384
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,160
Scott: I did the same thing only don't actually buy it.

385
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,380
Scott: I tell someone else to buy it.

386
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:29,247
Rym: He luckily and I'm very glad that a while ago for the most part my family used to always send me cards and gifts even after I'd graduated college and Over time they've stopped doing.

387
00:29:29,307 --> 00:29:35,320
Rym: I mean I still talk to my family a lot and I want to visit them and fly out to Arizona and fly out to Michigan and have them come out here and all that.

388
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:40,641
Rym: I talked to my grandpa as often as I can and I like my family But I don't like the whole gift thing like.

389
00:29:40,681 --> 00:29:49,089
Rym: I hate it when a relative I haven't talked to in a long time sends me a check for 20 bucks or Mails me just like a Christmas card that they signed.

390
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,172
Scott: Yeah, like.

391
00:29:50,212 --> 00:29:52,800
Rym: it doesn't feel like that means anything to me at all.

392
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,245
Scott: Yeah cards or something else.

393
00:29:54,285 --> 00:30:00,460
Scott: I mean my mom always see she's got like this hang up with the cards, you know It's like whenever it was any kind of thing.

394
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:05,110
Scott: She would always call me and be like, you know, it's such-and-such send a card, you know It's such-and-such send a car.

395
00:30:05,191 --> 00:30:06,400
Rym: See I don't do the card thing anymore.

396
00:30:06,541 --> 00:30:11,640
Rym: Oh if I want to if I have a holiday thing, I'll call someone or I'll call people or maybe I'll give them a gift.

397
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,228
Rym: But I'm never just gonna send it.

398
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,133
Rym: Maybe I'll write a letter.

399
00:30:14,153 --> 00:30:18,810
Rym: a letter is fine But a hallmark card to me is just like.

400
00:30:19,172 --> 00:30:24,008
Scott: well the most the biggest thing I have against the cards is that you're paying $4 for a piece of cardboard.

401
00:30:24,049 --> 00:30:26,900
Scott: some I mean if they're on sale $2 for a piece of cardboard.

402
00:30:27,222 --> 00:30:27,302
Scott: Now

403
00:30:27,343 --> 00:30:43,900
Rym: that's not to say that I haven't gotten some very awesome cards in my day But I will say that every card I've gotten that I cared about Wasn't just some hallmark card that someone signed like I'm holding one right now that I got from Emily a while ago and it's actually a whole letter in here just happens to be on a card and that is awesome.

404
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:49,840
Rym: I but a lot of relatives seem to just send me a hallmark card with maybe a really lame joke on the front.

405
00:30:50,324 --> 00:30:58,700
Scott: Yeah, some of the jokes are funny But if I wanted to be entertained like that I could read a webcomic or I could just go to the card store and read the cards.

406
00:30:59,202 --> 00:31:02,640
Scott: Yeah, I mean maybe it's it's the 90% of the cards are lame.

407
00:31:03,302 --> 00:31:09,500
Rym: See once I got to college I stopped celebrating most holidays other than you know, like around Christmas time.

408
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,660
Rym: I'd go see my family, but I wouldn't celebrate Christmas.

409
00:31:11,781 --> 00:31:27,960
Rym: I just celebrate being with my family and that was the time I went to see them and then I moved out of college and I stopped even celebrating that I really the only holidays I celebrate are yellow the sky day international talk like a pirate day Thanksgiving because Thanksgiving is a holiday that involves eating a lot of food.

410
00:31:28,742 --> 00:31:29,708
Rym: That's a great holiday.

411
00:31:29,869 --> 00:31:38,518
Scott: see before college We celebrated a shit ton of holidays because it was a Jew and Jews have a shit ton of holidays Just so we can get out of doing other stuff.

412
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:40,165
Rym: Yeah Well, we I mean we weren't.

413
00:31:40,506 --> 00:31:43,015
Rym: my family was very much not very Christian.

414
00:31:43,116 --> 00:31:47,237
Scott: if they really weren't Christian You aren't really Jewish except for celebrating holidays.

415
00:31:47,257 --> 00:31:56,120
Rym: Yeah Yeah, it was the same thing like we celebrated Easter and Christmas and all those things partly because when I was young I went to a Catholic school, but we didn't celebrate him for religious reasons.

416
00:31:56,442 --> 00:31:58,112
Rym: No one said the word Jesus on Easter.

417
00:31:58,153 --> 00:32:00,387
Rym: They said the word Easter Bunny mmm.

418
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:09,113
Scott: Anyway, when I first started going to college, you know, they tried to keep up the holiday action But they pretty much gave up on that pretty quickly.

419
00:32:09,474 --> 00:32:22,800
Scott: and now that I'm out of college I mean now there are some holidays where in college I wouldn't go home or anything and now I will go home because home is just an hour and a half away or so But not really any more celebratory in any sort of way.

420
00:32:23,121 --> 00:32:25,595
Rym: Well, I celebrate but I celebrate different ways.

421
00:32:25,675 --> 00:32:27,283
Rym: like this year Christmas I'm still seeing.

422
00:32:27,323 --> 00:32:29,492
Rym: hopefully I'm gonna fly out to Arizona to see my mom.

423
00:32:30,054 --> 00:32:30,316
Scott: Uh-huh.

424
00:32:30,356 --> 00:32:31,380
Scott: I thought you weren't gonna do that.

425
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:31,804
Rym: I want to.

426
00:32:31,865 --> 00:32:33,220
Rym: it's just a matter of getting good airfare.

427
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,307
Rym: If I don't I'm gonna.

428
00:32:34,608 --> 00:32:36,339
Scott: shouldn't you have bought the tickets a while ago?

429
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:42,480
Rym: No, because actually deals flying out there on jetblue come up fairly frequently at the last minute.

430
00:32:42,622 --> 00:32:48,037
Rym: Uh-huh Plus the the real plan is because I haven't seen a good deal like even way back when I was looking.

431
00:32:48,077 --> 00:32:49,384
Rym: I never really caught The deal.

432
00:32:49,404 --> 00:32:51,299
Scott: you're gonna just have to shell out if you want to go.

433
00:32:52,282 --> 00:33:02,640
Rym: My plan and I've done this before is that instead of going out on the actual holiday when everyone else in the world Including all those people who don't know how to deal with an airport are flying.

434
00:33:03,262 --> 00:33:06,110
Rym: I'm gonna go out in January when no one's flying.

435
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:06,772
Scott: How's your plan?

436
00:33:06,812 --> 00:33:07,795
Scott: last year and it didn't work?

437
00:33:08,015 --> 00:33:09,460
Rym: Yeah, because the airlines suck.

438
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:11,807
Scott: Whose fault is that?

439
00:33:11,968 --> 00:33:12,712
Scott: the airlines?

440
00:33:12,752 --> 00:33:14,160
Scott: you for taking the shit airline?

441
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:17,434
Rym: Because I'm not gonna pay I don't care how much I want to do something.

442
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:20,739
Rym: if it costs more than $300 to fly somewhere I pretty much won't go.

443
00:33:21,641 --> 00:33:22,464
Scott: You're stuck in the u.s.

444
00:33:22,505 --> 00:33:23,047
Scott: Forever then.

445
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:28,700
Rym: yeah, well, I mean, I'm maybe I'm special occasion like a holiday Like if I was traveling somewhere for a month, it'd be okay.

446
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,392
Rym: But if I'm flying somewhere for a weekend, maybe a three-day weekend.

447
00:33:32,753 --> 00:33:34,037
Rym: I'm not paying more than $300 to fly there.

448
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,645
Rym: I don't care what it is.

449
00:33:36,149 --> 00:33:37,276
Scott: Yeah, I guess that's all right.

450
00:33:37,377 --> 00:33:44,267
Rym: I mean I paid $160 to fly to Raleigh for an amazement and That really really sucked.

451
00:33:44,328 --> 00:33:54,418
Rym: I felt so bad about paying that cuz I could have driven there for less And it would have taken less time after all the delays at the airport, but I digress dun dun dun.

452
00:33:54,438 --> 00:33:55,039
Scott: I digress.

453
00:33:57,148 --> 00:34:01,974
Rym: gifts gifts So probably my favorite kinds of gifts to get now because I really don't give holiday.

454
00:34:01,994 --> 00:34:04,545
Rym: gifts are gifts for someone I really care about.

455
00:34:04,565 --> 00:34:12,337
Rym: that means something to them or to me or to both of us, you know like a gift that just comes up that's natural and makes sense or a hilarious gifts.

456
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:19,760
Rym: Hilarious gifts are the best you see at the Macross party and it seemed like a lame idea until we all really got into it.

457
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,993
Rym: We're having a secret Santa and being the front row crew.

458
00:34:23,053 --> 00:34:31,780
Rym: I'm gonna call it the secret Hanukkah, Harry everyone's putting a lot of Humorous thought into exactly what they are buying for this party.

459
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:39,275
Scott: Yeah I mean the problem is if you're not giving a gift Specifically to a person you need to get something that could be good for anybody.

460
00:34:39,696 --> 00:34:42,130
Scott: and that's kind of hard to do Because what's good for everybody?

461
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:49,790
Scott: Well a book Even a video game a really good one isn't good because they might have it Yeah, or they might not have the system.

462
00:34:49,971 --> 00:34:54,954
Rym: now people might say oh a gift certificate That's perhaps the lamest gift you can give someone.

463
00:34:54,994 --> 00:34:56,079
Rym: that's worse than cash.

464
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:59,820
Scott: better Give them money if you're gonna do that because at least then they can choose the store.

465
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,083
Scott: I mean if someone gave me like a Walmart gift certificate, I'd be like, I'm not going to Walmart You just gave me nothing.

466
00:35:04,484 --> 00:35:07,533
Rym: but that's also kind of I mean just even cash is really lame.

467
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,500
Rym: now say they were creative about it.

468
00:35:09,801 --> 00:35:14,336
Rym: Say the limit on the Secret Santa was 25 bucks and you give someone $25 worth of pennies.

469
00:35:15,626 --> 00:35:17,063
Scott: hilarious exactly.

470
00:35:17,103 --> 00:35:19,330
Scott: now see that's what it really is about gifts is.

471
00:35:19,752 --> 00:35:28,480
Scott: as a kid gifts are important because they're your Primary means of acquiring goods mostly entertainment goods that you cannot acquire on your own.

472
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,620
Rym: Yeah, I hate to say it but when I was a little kid Christmas was a spawn point.

473
00:35:31,821 --> 00:35:36,526
Scott: Yeah as an adult with money Gifts really hold.

474
00:35:36,948 --> 00:35:38,232
Scott: it's not like I need stuff.

475
00:35:38,312 --> 00:35:40,560
Scott: if I need something I can get it on my own.

476
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,860
Scott: I don't need someone to give me a gift to give me physical goods because I've got them.

477
00:35:45,381 --> 00:35:57,940
Scott: so if you're going to give me a gift the actual giving of the gift has to have some sort of humorous or entertaining or Emotional value of some sorts, you know, like yeah, I could have bought it at the store.

478
00:35:58,088 --> 00:36:06,829
Scott: but because you are giving it to me at this moment of in time in this fashion and because of what it is and the method of Delivery we are all happier for it.

479
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:09,380
Scott: And that is that is what you must execute with an adult gift.

480
00:36:09,548 --> 00:36:16,763
Rym: Yeah like I mean Emily gave me her old keyboard a while ago as you heard on the show and I've been playing with it a lot and I Think it's really awesome.

481
00:36:17,165 --> 00:36:17,365
Rym: Now.

482
00:36:17,847 --> 00:36:24,499
Rym: I own a piano and if I wanted to buy a keyboard I would have gone out and bought one and I didn't really need one to buy it.

483
00:36:24,941 --> 00:36:31,405
Rym: But the fact that she gave it to me and that was a thoughtful gift and that I've gotten so much Enjoyment out of it.

484
00:36:31,767 --> 00:36:32,590
Rym: That was a good gift.

485
00:36:33,052 --> 00:36:46,032
Rym: or like if someone goes on a vacation and They bring back like a really cool little souvenir and they give it to someone like I bought this in London in a blah and it's shaped like a blah.

486
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:47,056
Rym: Oh my god.

487
00:36:47,176 --> 00:36:48,160
Rym: That's an awesome gift.

488
00:36:48,421 --> 00:36:49,666
Scott: Yeah, a lot of times it's not.

489
00:36:49,686 --> 00:36:52,740
Rym: it depends with the souvenirs because no it has to be a good super.

490
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:59,482
Scott: Yeah Sometimes people go somewhere and they'll come back and they'll be like here's a t-shirt with the name of the place I went to.

491
00:36:59,663 --> 00:37:00,184
Scott: oh, no, no.

492
00:37:00,225 --> 00:37:03,898
Rym: No, I'm talking like the the DS eraser that you were given.

493
00:37:04,118 --> 00:37:06,317
Rym: Yeah Yeah, little things like that.

494
00:37:07,022 --> 00:37:10,960
Rym: Like actually I remember when Dan went to Japan way back.

495
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:20,120
Scott: We heard our IT and he came back and he got me just a little Totoro pencil board And I think he actually bought like a whole pile of cheap crap and gave different things to different people.

496
00:37:20,301 --> 00:37:22,067
Scott: Yeah, as he didn't actually plan it out.

497
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:23,372
Rym: Yeah, but it was still cuz.

498
00:37:23,613 --> 00:37:27,266
Rym: back then I didn't own any anime stuff I didn't have any pencil boards or anything.

499
00:37:27,788 --> 00:37:38,455
Rym: and he gave me this little trinket from Japan and I learned at that point that I really like little trinkets from Japan as you can tell if you look at my desk Which has almost as many trinkets from Japan as it does useful things.

500
00:37:38,515 --> 00:37:39,699
Scott: man trinkets from Japan.

501
00:37:40,222 --> 00:37:45,226
Scott: It's like I really hate getting useless stuff, but god damn you Trinkets in Japan.

502
00:37:45,246 --> 00:37:47,380
Rym: It's like give me a loose useless piece of plastic whatever.

503
00:37:47,721 --> 00:37:52,315
Rym: But if that useless piece of plastic is of a Japanese animated character, it's awesome.

504
00:37:52,616 --> 00:37:53,620
Scott: I don't know what's up with that.

505
00:37:56,344 --> 00:37:58,280
Scott: Yeah, there's no logic behind that one.

506
00:37:58,321 --> 00:37:58,877
Scott: It's not good.

507
00:37:59,401 --> 00:38:07,190
Rym: but I think really my my favorite kind of gift-giving is the humorous gift-giving, you know, the Secret Santa the Bachelor party joke gift.

508
00:38:07,732 --> 00:38:08,877
Scott: Oh, that's a party joking.

509
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:11,453
Rym: granted those can also be really lame.

510
00:38:11,493 --> 00:38:18,180
Rym: a lot of people go to like Spencer's and they buy like the over-the-hill toilet paper or the over-the-hill cane.

511
00:38:18,501 --> 00:38:20,026
Scott: Well, I think it's the stuff that's.

512
00:38:20,729 --> 00:38:26,220
Scott: if it's a generic gift if the gift would work for anyone Then a lot of it is pretty much lost.

513
00:38:26,381 --> 00:38:31,040
Scott: It has to be like a specific and personal thing for anything to come of it.

514
00:38:31,381 --> 00:38:35,031
Scott: You know, it's like you got to buy something like ah, there's something about that.

515
00:38:35,092 --> 00:38:35,874
Scott: that makes it funny.

516
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:47,299
Scott: Like if I bought a Pokemon doll and just gave it to you not funny, but if I bought you ten Pokemon Holding each other now that is something to it.

517
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:51,515
Rym: That's that's probably the perfect example exactly or like in our group.

518
00:38:51,877 --> 00:38:52,660
Rym: I'm not gonna do this.

519
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,800
Rym: This isn't my Secret Santa gift, but I talked it up and I actually kind of got the benefit by talking this gift up.

520
00:38:58,542 --> 00:39:04,461
Rym: I effectively got to give two gifts because the comedic value of the gifts is far greater than the monetary value Mm-hmm.

521
00:39:04,864 --> 00:39:08,883
Rym: So my real gift I have and is ready to go the gift I talked about.

522
00:39:09,184 --> 00:39:12,035
Rym: see we have an inside joke in the crew about hobo wine.

523
00:39:12,175 --> 00:39:13,841
Rym: I think we've talked about it before Mm-hmm.

524
00:39:14,262 --> 00:39:22,079
Rym: after yuko bought us some $2 MD 2020 that we all sampled and it was quite Ode hobo.

525
00:39:23,163 --> 00:39:25,229
Rym: It was really not good.

526
00:39:25,289 --> 00:39:25,911
Rym: Yeah, but it was.

527
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:27,455
Scott: I feel like drinking some right now.

528
00:39:27,575 --> 00:39:28,017
Scott: Just kidding.

529
00:39:28,217 --> 00:39:30,023
Rym: We've got it still Do we really?

530
00:39:30,164 --> 00:39:31,269
Scott: Yes, it's still good.

531
00:39:31,289 --> 00:39:32,735
Rym: I don't think it goes bad.

532
00:39:32,755 --> 00:39:34,000
Scott: Why has to go bad?

533
00:39:34,321 --> 00:39:34,642
Rym: I don't know.

534
00:39:34,702 --> 00:39:36,368
Rym: might not refrigerated alcohol.

535
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:37,572
Scott: We'll check it.

536
00:39:38,073 --> 00:39:39,799
Rym: Yeah, I don't know how we'll tell.

537
00:39:41,061 --> 00:39:42,006
Rym: Give it to a hobo.

538
00:39:42,408 --> 00:39:43,392
Rym: I know some hope but let's just.

539
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:44,317
Rym: I got it.

540
00:39:44,437 --> 00:39:44,819
Rym: I got it.

541
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:50,080
Rym: Let's just leave it on the street corner because those hobos walk by all the time.

542
00:39:51,161 --> 00:39:52,225
Rym: Let's see if someone takes it.

543
00:39:52,245 --> 00:39:55,015
Scott: We'll watch it where the camera some weekend.

544
00:39:55,055 --> 00:39:56,260
Rym: Yeah, we'll just keep an eye on it.

545
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,232
Scott: Let's go get a camera.

546
00:39:57,515 --> 00:40:02,916
Scott: Yeah Yeah That's the only thing of monetary value other than a Ferrari in a house that I don't have.

547
00:40:02,996 --> 00:40:06,960
Scott: and a new computer that I don't Have is a nice video camera because I have no clue.

548
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:09,538
Scott: It's not that I can't afford one It's I have no clue what to get.

549
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:13,040
Rym: But the hobo wine thing became kind of an inside joke for the crew.

550
00:40:13,481 --> 00:40:23,613
Rym: so I thought my secret Santa gift would be a ratty flannel shirt tied to the end of a stick like a bindle and Inside of it would be $20 worth of hobo wine.

551
00:40:24,215 --> 00:40:25,580
Scott: It's a lot of fucking hobo wine.

552
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,010
Scott: Yeah, you couldn't lift that in the flannel shirt.

553
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:28,853
Rym: I could lift it.

554
00:40:29,274 --> 00:40:30,640
Scott: I don't know the stick would break.

555
00:40:30,821 --> 00:40:32,507
Scott: You need a big seemed like a 2x4.

556
00:40:32,808 --> 00:40:34,112
Rym: I got I had the stick ready.

557
00:40:34,132 --> 00:40:35,096
Scott: Did you really?

558
00:40:35,116 --> 00:40:40,427
Rym: Yeah, wow that stick I was I was playing with on the back deck that big thick thing That could do it.

559
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:42,180
Scott: That would be kind of crazy though.

560
00:40:42,401 --> 00:40:46,040
Rym: Yeah, but see the idea of that joke is really funny, especially to someone in the crew.

561
00:40:46,602 --> 00:40:51,620
Rym: So I already got all the benefit of actually getting that gift without having to do anything exactly.

562
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:55,594
Scott: I mean, you know, you don't actually need to give physical goods.

563
00:40:55,614 --> 00:40:57,140
Scott: That's not what it's about anymore.

564
00:40:57,221 --> 00:41:03,996
Rym: You know, it sounds stupid But it's the thought that counts is probably the biggest axiom of gift-giving in the world.

565
00:41:04,056 --> 00:41:06,203
Scott: unless you're a little kid in which case Goddamn it.

566
00:41:06,223 --> 00:41:08,391
Scott: You need some fucking video games and not underwear.

567
00:41:08,531 --> 00:41:09,194
Rym: Yes socks.

568
00:41:09,435 --> 00:41:10,599
Rym: Press a. what the hell is this?

569
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:22,704
Scott: And I think that's the problem is you know Until kids until there's no more child labor laws and kids can go work and make their own money and buy their own games You we need to give them.

570
00:41:22,804 --> 00:41:28,460
Scott: goddamn gifts and if a kid already has everything well your kid doesn't need me more stop giving them.

571
00:41:30,901 --> 00:41:39,272
Rym: But yeah, I mean the the the sentiment behind a gift or the thought behind a gift and I guess now that we're adults matters A hell of a lot more than what the gift is.

572
00:41:39,594 --> 00:41:43,311
Rym: and as a result Instead of giving gifts we seem to have much more fun.

573
00:41:43,351 --> 00:41:46,082
Rym: Just getting together with our friends Mm-hmm.

574
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:50,095
Scott: I mean if we could all just think of hilarious gifts and tell them to each other.

575
00:41:50,115 --> 00:41:51,600
Scott: That would be just as good.

576
00:41:51,685 --> 00:41:54,869
Rym: Yeah So we're having this holiday party and pretty much no one's.

577
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:56,093
Rym: not many people are given.

578
00:41:56,153 --> 00:42:00,600
Rym: other people like I got this gift for you I got this gift for you and I got this gift for you.

579
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,082
Rym: It's just.

580
00:42:01,484 --> 00:42:04,399
Rym: we're all gonna present our hilarious gifts to the group.

581
00:42:04,781 --> 00:42:08,779
Rym: Disseminate them however, we will and then play guitar heroes too while we're drunk.

582
00:42:09,845 --> 00:42:11,622
Scott: Mm-hmm Sounds good.

583
00:42:11,944 --> 00:42:13,269
Rym: Yeah, you won't be drinking though.

584
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:13,710
Scott: Nope.

585
00:42:14,493 --> 00:42:16,120
Rym: Ah, what if I get some grog?

586
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,366
Rym: Some my hobo wine.

587
00:42:18,647 --> 00:42:18,969
Scott: It's all right.

588
00:42:18,989 --> 00:42:20,035
Rym: You tried the hobo wine.

589
00:42:20,136 --> 00:42:24,791
Rym: It was bad Real bad, I've drank worse things.

590
00:42:24,851 --> 00:42:29,289
Scott: I should go buy some grape juice In the bend the glass bottle and drink that.

591
00:42:29,711 --> 00:42:33,664
Rym: I got some sparkling apple juice for the people who don't want to drink champagne But it's sparkling.

592
00:42:34,225 --> 00:42:35,690
Rym: That's the point of champagne.

593
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:37,074
Scott: I don't like sparkling.

594
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:38,098
Rym: Why not?

595
00:42:38,218 --> 00:42:38,800
Scott: it fizzes.

596
00:42:39,141 --> 00:42:40,206
Rym: And what's wrong with fizz?

597
00:42:40,346 --> 00:42:41,552
Scott: It's you know, it's wrong with it.

598
00:42:41,753 --> 00:42:43,339
Rym: I'd like you to say it out loud on the air.

599
00:42:43,601 --> 00:42:46,812
Scott: That's what I was just trying to make sure that people understood that.

600
00:42:47,013 --> 00:42:47,917
Scott: that that you already knew.

601
00:42:47,937 --> 00:42:51,792
Scott: Yeah I already know is a it is not comfortable.

602
00:42:52,033 --> 00:42:53,920
Rym: So what do you mean by not comfortable?

603
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,995
Rym: You're saying that fizzy beverages beverages that are carbonated in some way harm you.

604
00:42:58,437 --> 00:42:59,080
Scott: they do indeed.

605
00:42:59,481 --> 00:43:12,280
Rym: so you're saying that you feel physical pain when a carbonated beverage is placed into your mouth a Carbonated beverage that the vast majority of Americans drink on a daily basis and love.

606
00:43:13,503 --> 00:43:14,311
Scott: Many do yes.

607
00:43:14,573 --> 00:43:23,073
Rym: Yes And this causes you physical pain in a very small way But enough of a pain to where you refuse to drink any such thing.

608
00:43:23,093 --> 00:43:24,499
Scott: I'd like to avoid it.

609
00:43:25,342 --> 00:43:27,353
Rym: Okay, I just wanted to get that out there.

610
00:43:27,614 --> 00:43:27,775
Rym: Yeah.

611
00:43:28,217 --> 00:43:28,358
Rym: Yeah.

612
00:43:29,821 --> 00:43:34,857
Rym: So I guess in closing you can look ten gift horses in the mouth, but you can't fool them twice.

613
00:43:35,398 --> 00:43:35,880
Scott: What the fuck?

614
00:43:37,923 --> 00:43:39,668
Scott: Are there two birds in the bush or three?

615
00:43:39,688 --> 00:43:42,297
Rym: I don't know but I killed more than one of them with a stone.
