1
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,982
Scott: It's Monday July 31st, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:14,022 --> 00:00:16,690
Scott: We go over a list of our favorite Firefox extensions.

3
00:00:18,171 --> 00:00:19,186
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:27,890
Rym: Well for anyone who's been living under a rock and hasn't actually been listening to us recently We're going to Otakon this weekend woohoo.

5
00:00:28,851 --> 00:00:33,390
Rym: Now Otakon is probably the highlight of our year for the front row crew every year.

6
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,243
Rym: It is also our largest gathering.

7
00:00:35,767 --> 00:00:40,520
Scott: next year It might be different because we were probably gonna go to other places perhaps Vegas perhaps yerp.

8
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:55,984
Rym: Well the thing is it's more that no matter what any of us do the front row crew always comes together every year at Otakon and then everyone who can swing it we go to the beach and Or other fun places for what we call the week of fun directly after a week

9
00:00:56,024 --> 00:00:56,546
Scott: of awesome.

10
00:00:56,827 --> 00:00:58,332
Rym: Oh, yes the week of awesome That's right.

11
00:00:58,372 --> 00:01:03,010
Rym: You know what they've been calling it the week of fun and the internal secret front row crew forums lately heathens.

12
00:01:03,492 --> 00:01:07,749
Rym: Yeah, I got to get on that because I realized mr.. Perry doesn't have access to that stuff.

13
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:16,197
Rym: no, cuz I the other day one of our friend see we have a forum just for you know like our private stuff and There was a point at which someone.

14
00:01:16,217 --> 00:01:19,128
Rym: I'm not gonna say who made a typo, and I was like god.

15
00:01:19,168 --> 00:01:19,409
Rym: Why isn't?

16
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:19,470
Rym: mr.

17
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,373
Rym: Perry had fixed this.

18
00:01:20,453 --> 00:01:24,446
Rym: it's been here forever, then I realized oh, oh he can't see that cuz he's.

19
00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:27,510
Scott: he's not in the front row crew anyway.

20
00:01:28,751 --> 00:01:33,770
Rym: Now that means that Thursday morning, we're going to Baltimore, so there's going to be no episode on Thursday.

21
00:01:34,312 --> 00:01:47,262
Rym: Oh sucks to be a Thursday only listener, and we're going to be out of town all next week Meaning instead of having normal GeekNights We're going to have GeekNights specials every day of the week that we're going to upload.

22
00:01:47,743 --> 00:01:49,267
Rym: actually they were uploaded yesterday.

23
00:01:49,287 --> 00:01:52,540
Rym: Oh They're already ready to go.

24
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,990
Scott: the illusion has been destroyed.

25
00:01:54,317 --> 00:01:56,815
Rym: Yeah Considering in every one of them.

26
00:01:57,056 --> 00:01:59,306
Rym: We basically say something to the effect of burn out here.

27
00:01:59,326 --> 00:02:07,290
Scott: now The specials are going to be basically short episodes by us except for the Monday special.

28
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,014
Rym: Yeah, Monday something really cool is.

29
00:02:09,215 --> 00:02:11,060
Scott: Monday is extra special.

30
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:19,905
Scott: so you being a Monday GeekNights listener you Probably want to listen to next Monday because it's going to be very interesting.

31
00:02:19,985 --> 00:02:21,450
Scott: I'm very interested to hear what it is.

32
00:02:21,893 --> 00:02:22,417
Rym: I'm excited.

33
00:02:22,578 --> 00:02:23,889
Scott: What can I say very excited?

34
00:02:24,831 --> 00:02:25,975
Scott: We'll let it stay a surprise.

35
00:02:26,377 --> 00:02:30,754
Rym: Yes, though also bear in mind that we I have appeared on Movies.

36
00:02:30,794 --> 00:02:32,830
Rym: you should see a podcast we both enjoy.

37
00:02:33,671 --> 00:02:35,902
Scott: Yeah, that that's all we're going to say about that.

38
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:37,610
Rym: Yes their episode about city of God.

39
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:39,722
Rym: We had some things to say about city of God.

40
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:48,110
Scott: I Think we also did another episode a long time ago attack the gas station Which if you were listening to GeekNights back then you already knew about.

41
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:53,157
Rym: Yeah, I see in regards to hate mail last week you were still a slow talker.

42
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:55,120
Rym: yes low talking I don't know.

43
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:56,553
Scott: I don't know either.

44
00:02:56,573 --> 00:02:57,075
Rym: All right.

45
00:02:57,255 --> 00:03:01,590
Rym: Anyway, it is Monday, you know science tech sci-fi day all those things.

46
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,641
Rym: We've got some newses like we always do.

47
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:04,304
Rym: no geek backs.

48
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,329
Rym: No geek backs.

49
00:03:06,132 --> 00:03:10,889
Scott: No, there's probably gonna be a shit ton of geek back type action coming after Otakon.

50
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:14,188
Scott: Oh good God, so two weeks from now will be the geek back times.

51
00:03:14,268 --> 00:03:14,489
Scott: now.

52
00:03:14,751 --> 00:03:15,293
Scott: No geek back

53
00:03:15,774 --> 00:03:30,049
Rym: and don't be surprised if today or tomorrow we go a little bit short just because basically Otakon has gotten to the point where it takes us an entire the entire week before Otakon to prepare for Otakon and Then the entire two weeks after Otakon to recover from Otakon.

54
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:37,450
Scott: So this week is gonna be oh no Thursday episode He already said but in fact Wednesday is going to be nothing more than the Otakon pregame.

55
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,470
Rym: It will be the beginning of our Otakon coverage exactly.

56
00:03:41,753 --> 00:03:43,650
Rym: So without further ado my news.

57
00:03:43,971 --> 00:03:55,940
Rym: I'm not gonna go over the details of this because similar stories to this one have been cropping up all over the place in the past several years and it's an issue that is Really starting to bother me and it's somewhat technologically related.

58
00:03:56,001 --> 00:03:58,207
Rym: So I got an excuse now.

59
00:03:58,528 --> 00:04:03,182
Rym: at Penn State not too long ago very recently in fact, there was something going on.

60
00:04:03,223 --> 00:04:04,386
Rym: some police were doing something.

61
00:04:04,406 --> 00:04:08,750
Rym: a Kid walked out of his parents house and saw these police doing something.

62
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,665
Rym: So he opened his cell phone and took a picture a few minutes later.

63
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:15,229
Rym: The police came over Arrested his ass took him to jail.

64
00:04:15,812 --> 00:04:21,290
Rym: They're charging him with other than this law about taking pictures of police, which is clearly unconstitutional.

65
00:04:22,055 --> 00:04:34,370
Rym: they also, you know obstruction of justice and interfering with investigation and all sorts of bullshit charges If that judge actually or lawyer jury or whoever actually convicts him on those charges.

66
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:35,393
Scott: That's heinous.

67
00:04:36,036 --> 00:04:40,070
Rym: at least at least the ACLU is all about this.

68
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:46,942
Scott: Yeah, there are a bunch of crazies in the ACLU and they often fight for crazy things But for sure, this is something that they're in the right on.

69
00:04:47,183 --> 00:04:49,312
Scott: Yeah, they are in the right quite often They came.

70
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:57,650
Scott: I don't think I've ever disagreed with them fighting for something because even though I've wanted to once or twice They were on the side of a court case and I was like, what are you doing?

71
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,468
Rym: well, I disagree with a lot of the people they defend.

72
00:05:00,488 --> 00:05:05,504
Rym: ah But I agree with the principles they stand for fully.

73
00:05:05,685 --> 00:05:09,298
Scott: yeah see that but the times that That I was saying what are you doing?

74
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:11,970
Scott: It was actually people that I kind of was on there.

75
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,369
Scott: So hey, yeah, it was just I was like, yeah, they broke the law.

76
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,026
Scott: But what can you do?

77
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,810
Rym: But the ACLU made a statement right away and they basically said that this is crap.

78
00:05:23,494 --> 00:05:31,990
Scott: And yeah, I've heard of you know people getting you know By police officers for taking pictures or told by security cards to move along.

79
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,518
Scott: You know all right, sir.

80
00:05:33,598 --> 00:05:35,870
Rym: I'm gonna need to ask you to move along.

81
00:05:36,181 --> 00:05:44,617
Scott: Yeah But I've never actually seen anyone go this far to arrest someone on the spot and charge them with all these extra Stupid excessive charges.

82
00:05:44,838 --> 00:05:53,728
Rym: now this story would have angered me greatly as it stands but there have been four or five almost identical stories over the past several months.

83
00:05:53,989 --> 00:05:56,190
Rym: and No, this was just the last straw for me.

84
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:56,852
Rym: This is just.

85
00:05:57,575 --> 00:06:01,290
Rym: I urge all of you if you see a police officer in public to take his picture.

86
00:06:01,451 --> 00:06:02,218
Scott: So here's the thing.

87
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:09,821
Scott: if you go look at my flicker You'll see one day when I was walking to I think I told this story on an early episode of the mugger Yeah, the purse snatcher.

88
00:06:10,365 --> 00:06:11,150
Scott: I was why I would live.

89
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:17,470
Scott: I worked in the city at the time and I was walking to my office from the train station And I heard some girl scream and I couldn't believe it.

90
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,920
Scott: There was a freaking purse snatcher and I went oh shits.

91
00:06:20,643 --> 00:06:26,730
Scott: and of course the first instinct is go Catch him and beat him up because someone else, you know, but they beat me to it.

92
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,540
Scott: So I said what do I do now?

93
00:06:29,284 --> 00:06:30,470
Scott: Uh, I know I'll take a picture.

94
00:06:31,174 --> 00:06:33,387
Scott: So I took a picture of the purse snatcher a couple of them.

95
00:06:33,407 --> 00:06:36,990
Scott: They're on my flicker You can find them and the cop was just like yeah, whatever

96
00:06:37,852 --> 00:06:42,025
Rym: I get the impression that the only police officers who have a problem with you taking are

97
00:06:42,045 --> 00:06:43,810
Scott: the ones who do things wrong

98
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,298
Rym: Yes or the ones who really shouldn't be police officers

99
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:54,104
Scott: or the ones who were poorly trained or their noobs or Perhaps they've done other things wrong.

100
00:06:54,506 --> 00:07:01,210
Rym: and yeah I mean people have commented that it seems as though I generally take a very adversarial position on the police.

101
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:08,292
Rym: I mean on FARC I once posted an extensive guide on how to avoid the police if you were on a bicycle Mm-hmm.

102
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:13,589
Rym: due to some personal experience the statute of limitations is over almost over on but I digress.

103
00:07:14,632 --> 00:07:25,425
Rym: I have also generally encouraged people to not speak to the police unless they have a warrant or they're arresting you and I guess or unless you're gonna be friendly with them like hey, man, what's up?

104
00:07:25,606 --> 00:07:26,450
Rym: Yeah, which I've done often.

105
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,302
Scott: I mean, hey, can I can you tell me how to find this train station?

106
00:07:29,423 --> 00:07:38,030
Rym: actually the police and Beacon are really cool Partly because they really don't go after stupid traffic laws and they actually seem to only exist to protect people.

107
00:07:38,652 --> 00:07:45,210
Scott: Yeah, well the beacon, you know beacon has some not-so-nice people in it true and some uncouth individuals.

108
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:48,161
Scott: So the police mostly have their hands full with those types.

109
00:07:48,562 --> 00:07:50,650
Scott: So people like us you're just like whatever.

110
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,769
Scott: Hey, how's it going?

111
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:58,690
Rym: Plus there's no major road going through beacon that would require that would be able to generate ticket revenue on any reasonable basis.

112
00:07:58,851 --> 00:08:01,902
Rym: Oh 52, I guess no cuz not know so many people go through.

113
00:08:01,962 --> 00:08:04,010
Rym: fish kill is where they get everyone in the road.

114
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:10,390
Rym: We live on me now because no one drives through beacon 90 maybe now cuz no one goes through that far.

115
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:11,676
Scott: No, whatever.

116
00:08:12,078 --> 00:08:14,470
Rym: Yeah, plus there's nowhere on that road for a cop to sit.

117
00:08:15,491 --> 00:08:16,857
Scott: They could do it on the beacon bridge.

118
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:17,460
Rym: Yeah.

119
00:08:17,601 --> 00:08:19,670
Rym: Yeah, I don't think they have the authority to do so.

120
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:20,795
Scott: I don't know.

121
00:08:21,176 --> 00:08:24,190
Rym: I'm pretty sure they don't because that's because I saw that that bridge is.

122
00:08:25,411 --> 00:08:31,531
Rym: I don't know what the deal is, but there's a federal thing that you can't take pictures from or of the bridge next to our House.

123
00:08:31,832 --> 00:08:32,433
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

124
00:08:32,514 --> 00:08:32,735
Scott: is it?

125
00:08:32,775 --> 00:08:40,136
Scott: we could a state cop do it possibly but I guess it might have to be some weird River type maybe the Port Authority.

126
00:08:40,217 --> 00:08:41,422
Scott: No, they're in New York City thing.

127
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:41,962
Scott: I don't know.

128
00:08:42,284 --> 00:08:43,890
Rym: Yeah, it's it's just in general.

129
00:08:44,332 --> 00:08:53,340
Rym: I. my theory on police is very simply that 99% of police give the 1% a bad name but the 1% are the ones doing the most stuff.

130
00:08:53,380 --> 00:09:02,550
Rym: cuz 99% of them are just sitting around like Andy Griffith show I just it's at the point in this country where I'm actually always and I'm dead serious.

131
00:09:03,034 --> 00:09:12,130
Rym: I am more afraid of being accosted Harassed or molested by police officers in this country than I am about any criminals any terrorists anyone else in the world?

132
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:19,170
Rym: Yeah, yeah because actually police bother me on a fairly regular basis mostly because I do things that probably stand out to them.

133
00:09:19,213 --> 00:09:24,915
Rym: I mean I'll be on my bike in the middle of the night or I'll be out for a walk like in the middle of a snow Storm at night.

134
00:09:24,995 --> 00:09:27,070
Rym: Usually I'm just out at night and police are like, what are you doing?

135
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,881
Rym: Yeah to which I say officer unless you're arresting me.

136
00:09:30,981 --> 00:09:34,232
Rym: I would like to go on my way and not say another word to you Mm-hmm.

137
00:09:34,836 --> 00:09:36,610
Rym: Well do what we've said it before and I'll say it again.

138
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,445
Rym: We'll do a whole show on how to deal with the police someday.

139
00:09:38,626 --> 00:09:43,248
Scott: Okay, so GPL three draft number two is out.

140
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:52,820
Scott: and for the non lawyers including myself and Rym I have read some Journalists describe what it says.

141
00:09:53,122 --> 00:10:03,316
Rym: Well first the GPL the GNU general public license is a license you can use to just basically anything you create ever is For the most usually software.

142
00:10:03,617 --> 00:10:05,646
Rym: Well anything in general though is copyrighted by default.

143
00:10:06,128 --> 00:10:18,410
Rym: There's a copy Okay, and no one has the right to use what you created except in certain commonly accepted Ways fair use and eventually public domain without your permission.

144
00:10:19,031 --> 00:10:35,870
Rym: Now the GPL and similar things like Creative Commons are Ways are easy ways that are already written and tested by lawyers So that the legalese is already in there where you can say the thing I just created is released under this license meaning you all out there can use it for all these purposes.

145
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,225
Rym: You don't have to bother me about it and it's perfectly legal.

146
00:10:38,245 --> 00:10:41,370
Scott: Mm-hmm Well, sometimes the license says you have to tell me about it.

147
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,758
Rym: Well, yeah, you can change.

148
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:43,684
Rym: you can do whatever you want.

149
00:10:43,704 --> 00:10:52,490
Rym: You can alter the license But in general it's a way to allow other people to use what you have created While not giving up all of your rights to what you just created.

150
00:10:52,884 --> 00:11:02,134
Scott: Yeah So I mean you could just put something in the public domain right away Or you could say I want to keep like one of the rights that I have but I want to give the rest of them Plus the.

151
00:11:02,174 --> 00:11:09,050
Rym: the one thing about public domain is that once something is in the public domain You could like say I wrote a book and I put it in the public domain.

152
00:11:09,552 --> 00:11:13,045
Rym: Scott could take the book say he wrote it and there's nothing wrong with that.

153
00:11:13,346 --> 00:11:16,135
Rym: public domain means 100% public right?

154
00:11:16,215 --> 00:11:19,463
Scott: Well, the GPL is bit is licensed that Linux uses.

155
00:11:19,543 --> 00:11:24,295
Scott: It's the license that most Linux software uses and The gist of what it says.

156
00:11:24,335 --> 00:11:28,890
Scott: the main point of it that way is that this this software is open source.

157
00:11:29,593 --> 00:11:34,513
Scott: You can sell it you can copy it you can share it with friends you can modify it.

158
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:42,041
Scott: if you choose to modify it it that modification also has to be open source and That's what it says.

159
00:11:43,051 --> 00:11:43,814
Scott: GP cart.

160
00:11:43,854 --> 00:11:48,671
Scott: right now Linux and everything else uses GPL version 2.

161
00:11:48,671 --> 00:11:51,608
Scott: GPL version 3 has two important changes.

162
00:11:53,453 --> 00:12:01,770
Scott: The first important change has to do with DRM and DRM is that stuff that makes you not able to copy iTunes files and play them on non iPods.

163
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,877
Rym: Yeah, DRM is such a terrible misnomer.

164
00:12:03,897 --> 00:12:10,477
Rym: I mean, it's called digital rights management when really it's more like digital Digital copyright restriction blah blah blah.

165
00:12:10,617 --> 00:12:15,532
Scott: Yeah, the point of it is is that GPL version 3?

166
00:12:15,532 --> 00:12:20,826
Scott: Says you basically can't do DRM with a GPL software.

167
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:25,140
Scott: now in so many words That's so wrong because I generalized it so much.

168
00:12:25,261 --> 00:12:32,802
Scott: but to give a specific example ready Let's say I'm TiVo and I use Linux on my TiVo.

169
00:12:32,962 --> 00:12:35,208
Scott: now, of course, I have to open source that software.

170
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:35,890
Scott: That's a given.

171
00:12:36,014 --> 00:12:36,508
Scott: That's fine.

172
00:12:37,431 --> 00:12:43,990
Scott: Let's say I make it that I only want people to run this particular version of software on TiVo's.

173
00:12:45,091 --> 00:12:51,197
Scott: So I put something in the hardware and I put something in the software that is Technologically similar to DRM.

174
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:57,610
Scott: that way people can't run other software on their TiVo's They can only run the TiVo software on the TiVo's.

175
00:12:58,992 --> 00:13:01,309
Scott: GPL version 2 allows that just fine.

176
00:13:01,891 --> 00:13:16,201
Scott: GPL version 3 does not and therefore the people who make GPL version 3 which include Richard Stallman in the new Whatever the free software foundation disagree with Linus Torvalds who says he was on the side of TiVo.

177
00:13:16,281 --> 00:13:22,096
Rym: Linus is the one who maintains the Linux kernel Yeah and He says that GPL version 3 sucks.

178
00:13:22,277 --> 00:13:26,450
Scott: Linux is gonna keep using number 2 and the people from the free software foundation are all like.

179
00:13:27,711 --> 00:13:47,585
Rym: Now I'm fairly ambivalent because on one hand I see where RMS at all are coming from because they are basically of the mind that DRM is an evil and This will prevent people who want to use this evil from also using open source thus limiting their options and making it harder for People to use DRM and DRM encrypted software.

180
00:13:47,987 --> 00:13:48,128
Scott: Mm-hmm.

181
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:58,910
Rym: But at the same time Linus is arguing that by doing so you're preventing people who would all Otherwise use open source software from using it because you're not allowing them to use it for their purpose

182
00:13:59,231 --> 00:13:59,451
Scott: Mm-hmm,

183
00:13:59,812 --> 00:14:04,926
Rym: and they both have valid points and I think that people should use whichever version of the GPL they want to.

184
00:14:05,568 --> 00:14:06,370
Scott: here's the problem.

185
00:14:07,051 --> 00:14:25,570
Scott: the free software foundation recommends that when you right now if you were to say release a piece of software and you wanted to do it under the GPL and you followed the FSF recommendations exactly they recommend the use that you license your software as GPL version 2 or greater.

186
00:14:26,253 --> 00:14:30,932
Scott: Linus had the foresight to license Linux as GPL version 2 Period.

187
00:14:31,494 --> 00:14:34,585
Scott: a lot of people have licensed it as GPL version 2 or greater.

188
00:14:35,087 --> 00:14:35,930
Scott: That's problem.

189
00:14:36,314 --> 00:14:43,388
Rym: Well, the thing is if it's 2 or greater Then that means that generally if you use something that is licensed under that you can choose which of the two you want.

190
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:46,422
Rym: and since The later one is more restrictive.

191
00:14:46,924 --> 00:14:56,894
Rym: There's really no problem I think unless it says unless it very specifically says or greater in the sense that the newest version is always the one this Is licensed on.

192
00:14:56,914 --> 00:14:59,370
Scott: I think this is the second one, although I'm not a hundred percent sure.

193
00:14:59,511 --> 00:15:00,114
Rym: See, I don't think so.

194
00:15:00,135 --> 00:15:02,610
Rym: But even if that were the case, it's still your thing.

195
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:07,890
Rym: It might be 2 and greater like GeekNights, right GeekNights is released under the Creative Commons license with a few.

196
00:15:08,536 --> 00:15:09,588
Rym: We've got a whole thing about it.

197
00:15:10,232 --> 00:15:10,433
Scott: but

198
00:15:10,915 --> 00:15:15,594
Rym: if we wanted to change that we could change it just like that and Anything that anyone

199
00:15:15,634 --> 00:15:16,336
Scott: here's the thing

200
00:15:16,436 --> 00:15:26,110
Rym: thing that has already been released is already can already be used under the old license But it could also be used under the new license if we said so because we have full rights to whatever we want.

201
00:15:26,411 --> 00:15:26,531
Scott: Mm-hmm.

202
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:27,395
Scott: All right.

203
00:15:27,515 --> 00:15:30,929
Scott: Anyway, these another problem with the GPL version 3 and it has to do with patents.

204
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:40,530
Scott: and What it all comes down to is that Sure, the FSF guys they who make the GPL want there to be less software patents.

205
00:15:40,911 --> 00:15:43,178
Scott: So it doesn't exactly say this.

206
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:52,306
Scott: but in so many words if you want to make something patentable You can't you know patent open source software with GPL version 3.

207
00:15:52,306 --> 00:15:57,229
Rym: now take everything I just said and apply it to this because it's the same issue.

208
00:15:58,032 --> 00:16:07,299
Scott: Yeah, in fact HP has said yeah, we don't like this GPL version 3 because we want to make open source stuff but we want to put our patented stuff in there also.

209
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:19,670
Rym: and see now the thing is I Generally err on the side of freedom But at the same time the people doing all of these software patents and DRM are in my eyes to a certain extent evil.

210
00:16:20,372 --> 00:16:24,126
Scott: yeah, it's like the GPL guys writing the GPL.

211
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:29,222
Scott: they want to Help stop these evil things that we recognize are bad things.

212
00:16:29,262 --> 00:16:39,469
Scott: DRM and software patents bad and bad however By the problem is is that if governments legislate software patents and DRM, that's bad.

213
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:47,481
Scott: But at the same time if they put DRM or software patents in the license Even though they're on the side of good.

214
00:16:47,501 --> 00:16:49,730
Scott: That's also bad for other reasons.

215
00:16:50,795 --> 00:16:56,337
Scott: the best thing that people could possibly do with DRM and Software patents is nothing.

216
00:16:56,999 --> 00:17:03,317
Rym: now bear in mind that when we say I'm not saying that we're against copyright There's a whole different argument very specifically.

217
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:04,138
Rym: It's DRM.

218
00:17:04,219 --> 00:17:04,881
Rym: That is the evil.

219
00:17:05,102 --> 00:17:21,342
Rym: Mm-hmm because DRM basically creates a situation wherein Information that was created and exists can be locked down Destroyed and lost forever at the whims of the people who created it while I'm of the mind that information that is created Should never be allowed to be destroyed.

220
00:17:21,362 --> 00:17:27,829
Scott: Yeah, imagine if George Lucas made Star Wars in the time of DRM.

221
00:17:28,732 --> 00:17:39,490
Scott: He would basically with a wave of his hand eliminate every single copy of the the original First three episodes four or five and six and we wouldn't have you know, the copies that we have today.

222
00:17:39,739 --> 00:17:53,557
Rym: Yeah I mean look quite literally if the DRM vision of the future of computing came through and this has happened back Then George Lucas could have snapped his fingers and no one would ever again be able to see The scene where Han Solo shoots first.

223
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:57,550
Rym: and in fact, there would be no way to prove that Han Solo did in fact shoot first.

224
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:58,751
Scott: Absolutely.

225
00:17:58,771 --> 00:17:59,413
Scott: No way.

226
00:17:59,594 --> 00:18:00,997
Scott: that is why DRM is bad.

227
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:11,861
Rym: or what if the government decided that they were gonna use DRM to protect all their voting Records and then on a whim they could just delete the voting records or change the voting records and there's no way for anyone to Ever prove otherwise.

228
00:18:11,982 --> 00:18:12,730
Rym: Yeah, no one could.

229
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:23,570
Scott: Nowadays, you can technically Freedom of Information Act and all this stuff But you know that none of that will help you if they've just deleted all the evidence and it's not there anymore.

230
00:18:23,691 --> 00:18:28,419
Rym: Yeah, because there are currently legal Restrictions on getting information to disseminating information.

231
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:33,777
Rym: DRM is another step with physical permanent restrictions Mm-hmm, not good.

232
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:42,510
Rym: and in regards to patents, which is a whole other issue I think I can say with certainty that the official position of GeekNights is that software patents are bollocks.

233
00:18:43,012 --> 00:18:43,715
Scott: They are indeed.

234
00:18:43,735 --> 00:18:46,988
Rym: How can you patent a large number that may or may not be prime?

235
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:53,506
Scott: Yeah I mean If you saw a lot of this problem with software patents is it's sort of like patenting screws.

236
00:18:53,646 --> 00:18:59,390
Scott: if you patent the screw Then no one can make a machine with a screw in it without paying you money.

237
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:07,598
Rym: And in fact, I am under no obligation to let you even though say I invented the screw and I patented it I don't have to let you use my screw or anything.

238
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:17,071
Rym: Yeah, you'd have to invent some sort of other mechanical Device or bit to make our machines and we're not gonna get into it now because this is a new is not a thing of The day.

239
00:19:17,111 --> 00:19:34,666
Rym: but I can tell you with but with the full backing of my professional education and career That if software patents had existed and what had been used during the early years of computing Software and technology related to computing would not have progressed even a quarter as far as it has.

240
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:41,888
Rym: you wouldn't be podcasting right now Mostly because mp3s where mp3s were probably never because none of none of what we have now would have happened.

241
00:19:42,089 --> 00:19:52,552
Scott: Nothing things of the day Thingy thingy thingy.

242
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,564
Rym: Well, why do you always do that?

243
00:19:54,604 --> 00:19:55,486
Rym: Well, what is that from you?

244
00:19:55,506 --> 00:19:59,544
Rym: just say that or I don't know Thingy thingy thing.

245
00:19:59,584 --> 00:20:02,778
Scott: It's like you say things of the day and then I just have an urge to say something.

246
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:04,585
Scott: So What do you want?

247
00:20:04,827 --> 00:20:06,238
Rym: Where could he be?

248
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,247
Scott: That's fishy fishy fishy.

249
00:20:08,629 --> 00:20:09,977
Rym: Well, no, no, no, it's thing of the day.

250
00:20:10,037 --> 00:20:10,540
Rym: thing of the day.

251
00:20:11,324 --> 00:20:12,238
Scott: What is your thing of the day?

252
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:25,790
Rym: My thing of the day is something pretty awesome that Lisa actually sent me a link to and it's on a live journal Which I bristle at because I don't like live journal, but at the same time This is the most awesome Cthulhu doll I've ever seen.

253
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:29,620
Rym: it is made entirely out of leather and it is a sight to behold.

254
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:31,348
Rym: I highly recommend you click on this link.

255
00:20:31,408 --> 00:20:35,318
Rym: And if you don't know what Cthulhu is, I Think you're a lost cause.

256
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,624
Rym: Okay, that's all I got.

257
00:20:38,684 --> 00:20:39,046
Rym: I'm quick.

258
00:20:39,567 --> 00:20:44,602
Scott: okay, my thing of the day is actually technological which is good for a Monday Boom.

259
00:20:44,622 --> 00:20:55,586
Scott:  now this I'm gonna actually do a somewhat technical explanation But for the non-technical of you, I will give a one sentence Some summary at the end.

260
00:20:55,807 --> 00:20:57,113
Rym: Yeah, were you gonna say summation?

261
00:20:57,334 --> 00:20:57,595
Rym: Yes.

262
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:58,238
Rym: Why didn't you?

263
00:20:58,398 --> 00:21:00,064
Scott: I don't know All right.

264
00:21:00,104 --> 00:21:04,500
Scott: So this guy had problems with his neighbors accessing his wireless network.

265
00:21:05,402 --> 00:21:14,940
Scott: So he modified his DHCP servers configuration to put them all the people on the open wireless network with different Mac addresses onto a separate sub network.

266
00:21:16,103 --> 00:21:30,535
Scott: then using IP tables He rerouted all incoming traffic Going to the untrusted Separate subnet through a squid proxy server on the squid proxy server.

267
00:21:30,575 --> 00:21:40,580
Scott: He wrote a redirection script that combined with image magic would flip all images coming down over the internet.

268
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:52,239
Scott: So to summarize that when his neighbors used his wireless network to browse the web all Pictures were upside down, but everything else was fine.

269
00:21:52,861 --> 00:21:55,709
Rym: Yep, that is beautiful.

270
00:21:55,769 --> 00:21:59,680
Rym: That is an absolutely beautiful thing and I don't know what I can say.

271
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:06,786
Scott: He was also able to do other things because you know image magic is a command-line program that can pretty much modify an image Any way you want.

272
00:22:07,129 --> 00:22:08,800
Scott: he made all the images blurry.

273
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,853
Scott: He could monochrome all the images.

274
00:22:12,174 --> 00:22:13,620
Rym: now think about some Luddite dude.

275
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:13,941
Rym: He can.

276
00:22:14,002 --> 00:22:18,180
Scott: he can negative all the images to make them crazy colors about some dude who doesn't know much about tech.

277
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:25,864
Rym: but he's got his laptop and he's connected to this wireless and all the pictures on his internets are blurry and He can't figure out why.

278
00:22:25,964 --> 00:22:27,268
Rym: he's probably getting really agitated.

279
00:22:27,288 --> 00:22:27,750
Scott: and they're all.

280
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:31,602
Scott: it's only on in web pages and any images that come From the internet.

281
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:37,640
Scott: it basically filters all gif paying JPEG images coming from the internet and flips them upside down.

282
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:42,359
Scott: That's just beautiful Fantastic, I think we should do something like that.

283
00:22:42,668 --> 00:22:54,413
Rym: Yeah plus remember kids having a wireless access point Always gives you an excuse to not get gotten by the RIAA and the MPAA Because there's no way they can prove that it was you downloading or uploading dick.

284
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:56,180
Rym: Yep, the more, you know.

285
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:04,688
Scott: Yeah, this is a lot more interesting for someone who understands the technology behind it because you see how clever he was in the way He did it.

286
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:07,740
Rym: Yes Mad props very mad props.

287
00:23:08,545 --> 00:23:19,873
Rym: Now anyway today being Monday in tech day We decided we were going to talk a bit about Firefox extensions the ones we use the ones that are good and the ones that are crap All the ones I don't use a crap.

288
00:23:20,155 --> 00:23:24,820
Rym: Yes All right I don't use nearly as many as Scott.

289
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:31,579
Scott: So, you know, I have a lot of them that I use very little but I have them because that one time they're gonna be useful.

290
00:23:31,981 --> 00:23:33,326
Scott: Wham there they are.

291
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:41,140
Scott: Well the one that comes with Firefox the DOM inspector, which is wonderful It's only really good if you're a web developer who's doing a lot of JavaScript type stuff.

292
00:23:41,561 --> 00:23:50,680
Rym: Yeah, but my most used extensions are very easily and simply the delicious one Which lets me right click on a page and add it to delicious and do all the delicious stuff.

293
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:55,117
Scott: Yeah, I use the official delicious extension, which you know, I only use it for one thing.

294
00:23:55,217 --> 00:23:55,960
Scott: I'm at a web page.

295
00:23:56,121 --> 00:23:57,349
Scott: I want to add it to my delicious.

296
00:23:57,389 --> 00:24:04,436
Scott: I push the delicious button thing Much easier than copying the URL going to delicious opening it pasting it.

297
00:24:04,456 --> 00:24:07,655
Scott: I Just push one button and I'm all good.

298
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:14,187
Rym: Yep I like it mostly because I use it to keep track of all the things I've seen during the week that I'm going to talk About on GeekNights.

299
00:24:14,228 --> 00:24:15,400
Scott: That's what I use it for.

300
00:24:15,601 --> 00:24:20,020
Rym: So if you really want to be ahead of the game, you could watch my own people are ahead of the game.

301
00:24:20,124 --> 00:24:25,080
Rym: Well, yeah I know some people try to guess at what my thing of the day is based on what I've put in my delicious recently.

302
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:30,690
Scott: Mmm, I tag all my things of the day with the tag thing of the day But you never know which one I'm gonna use.

303
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,700
Scott: or maybe I'll use something that isn't tagged.

304
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:35,851
Rym: Sometimes I do sometimes I don't sometimes I take things GeekNights.

305
00:24:35,911 --> 00:24:36,633
Rym: Sometimes I don't.

306
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:39,298
Rym: I guess it depends on how sure I am That I'm going to use it.

307
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:45,260
Scott: Yeah, it's like I'd like to go through my delicious and sort of make all the tags uniform again, but nah screw them.

308
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,090
Rym: Oh god, my tags have diverged so much.

309
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:53,757
Rym: my tags are just so crazy and out there I mean, I have a. I looked and I saw that the majority of tags I have were only ever used once.

310
00:24:54,219 --> 00:24:58,880
Rym: Wow Yeah, me.me also I think the one thing I do is I do tag a lot of my things with FARC.

311
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,951
Rym: So any FARC tag is usually prevalent in delicious.

312
00:25:01,971 --> 00:25:04,219
Rym: for me, you know sad scary amusing asinine.

313
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:06,488
Scott: All right All right up more Firefox extensions.

314
00:25:06,608 --> 00:25:06,829
Rym: All right.

315
00:25:06,889 --> 00:25:08,034
Rym: Well, that was a nice segue.

316
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:09,480
Rym: I was gonna do until you ruined it.

317
00:25:10,021 --> 00:25:15,999
Rym: Oh now my favorite and most used extension other than adblock which we'll talk about in a minute is FARC.

318
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:18,226
Rym: it which is simple and beautiful.

319
00:25:18,648 --> 00:25:31,694
Rym: see on FARC now in in terms of levels of Technology and Interestingness involved in creating places for people to discuss things on the internet FARC is pretty much only one step above chaos.

320
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:39,046
Rym: I Mean that the bottom FARC us at the bottom is 4chan 4chan I can't follow.

321
00:25:39,066 --> 00:25:42,599
Rym: I have never seen a coherent conversation in 4chan.

322
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:55,489
Rym: I don't think it's for coherent conversation But I have never seen a single post that looked like it in any way was related to any other post other than the fact that occasionally there would be a picture of something pornographic.

323
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:59,720
Rym: that was appeared to be related to the previous picture of something pornographic.

324
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:05,194
Rym: But the next step above that is FARC now slashed out is moderated and dig has you know?

325
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,864
Rym: moderate you can dig people up and down FARC.

326
00:26:08,327 --> 00:26:11,844
Rym: the only moderation is if you post something illegal You will be deleted.

327
00:26:12,346 --> 00:26:16,603
Rym: other and they block out a few words that would get you you know if you were in work.

328
00:26:17,024 --> 00:26:25,489
Rym: other than that if you post something it appears and It's just it's a string of guys name what he posted guys name what he posted and that's it.

329
00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:33,690
Rym: and It's a fine art to be able to read all the different simultaneous Conversations that are going on in FARC because there's absolutely no way to separate them.

330
00:26:33,871 --> 00:26:39,339
Scott: Yeah, if they had some threading in there, it would make it easier to read But I think it would also destroy the whole that is FARC.

331
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,570
Rym: Yes, it would because it's really it's a skill And I put far more points into it than I should have.

332
00:26:44,802 --> 00:26:56,470
Rym: Yes But FARC it is a beautiful extension that you highlight because a lot of times you want to reply to someone and there's an etiquette Where if you want to reply to what someone said you take their name you put it in bold then you would enter twice.

333
00:26:56,831 --> 00:26:58,981
Rym: Then you take whatever you wanted to quote from them.

334
00:26:59,021 --> 00:26:59,905
Rym: you put in italics.

335
00:26:59,925 --> 00:27:00,989
Rym: you would enter twice again.

336
00:27:01,512 --> 00:27:02,395
Rym: Then you respond.

337
00:27:02,737 --> 00:27:05,949
Rym: that way you go into the thread and you want to see anyone responded to you.

338
00:27:06,477 --> 00:27:14,425
Rym: I hit you know Slash or control F or whatever you use and I type my name and then I look for instances of my name in order to See if anyone responded to me.

339
00:27:15,392 --> 00:27:16,656
Rym: FARC it automates this.

340
00:27:16,957 --> 00:27:22,436
Rym: if you highlight text anywhere on FARC and you right-click it adds FARC it and you click on that.

341
00:27:22,777 --> 00:27:25,105
Rym: it creates all the HTML and everything and you're.

342
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:27,606
Rym: all you have to do now is type your Posts and then hit enter.

343
00:27:28,753 --> 00:27:34,330
Scott: Aha, so it adds features to FARC that should be in the FARC website itself, but you just use an extension instead.

344
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:42,710
Rym: Well, the thing is FARC gets so much traffic that I don't think it would be economically feasible to add any sort of anything to FARC other than the static text you get.

345
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,590
Scott: I think that they could add a quote button without hurting themselves.

346
00:27:47,092 --> 00:27:48,598
Rym: They don't even have HTML buttons.

347
00:27:48,859 --> 00:27:49,501
Rym: If you don't know.

348
00:27:49,682 --> 00:27:51,630
Rym: if you don't know HTML, you're just fucked on FARC.

349
00:27:53,211 --> 00:27:53,974
Scott: Alright, let's see.

350
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,279
Scott: Let's talk about adblock.

351
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,390
Rym: Alright adblock is the single most important extension in the world.

352
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:02,383
Scott: Yeah, well, there are actually two extensions is adblock and adblock plus.

353
00:28:02,785 --> 00:28:05,454
Scott: as far as I'm concerned They're equivalent.

354
00:28:05,594 --> 00:28:10,129
Scott: However, a lot of people adblock plus does have more features and a lot of people prefer it.

355
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:13,869
Scott: I personally don't care which whichever I use whichever one suits my whim.

356
00:28:14,512 --> 00:28:19,950
Scott: Yeah, but some people say adblock plus all the way and some people say adblock plus sucks adblock all the way.

357
00:28:20,271 --> 00:28:20,652
Scott: I don't care.

358
00:28:21,014 --> 00:28:21,777
Scott: No, they're the same.

359
00:28:21,817 --> 00:28:30,150
Rym: before we talk about the filter set G adblock by itself All it is is say you see an ad you right-click on the ad and you say adblock.

360
00:28:30,551 --> 00:28:35,388
Rym: it opens a little dialog and it shows you the URL of the ad and you can tie.

361
00:28:35,408 --> 00:28:38,890
Rym: you can Cut it short or add wildcards do whatever you want to do.

362
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:45,010
Rym: You're basically creating a rule that says any image that follows this rule will not be shown to me ever again.

363
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:49,743
Scott: So for example, let's say your favorite website is Rym and Scott.com.

364
00:28:50,284 --> 00:28:54,318
Scott: and Rym and Scott.com have a bunch of advertising images and they keep them at.

365
00:28:54,378 --> 00:28:59,155
Scott: Rym and Scott.com slash ads slash Name of the ad gift.

366
00:28:59,717 --> 00:29:00,559
Scott: you make a rule.

367
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,930
Scott: That's Rym and Scott.com slash ads slash star.

368
00:29:04,552 --> 00:29:09,810
Scott: That way any images that are at Rym and Scott.com slash ads you won't see them ever.

369
00:29:10,252 --> 00:29:11,538
Scott: They just won't be visible to you.

370
00:29:11,879 --> 00:29:12,884
Rym: It also has two options.

371
00:29:12,904 --> 00:29:18,682
Rym: You can tell it to either Download the ads but don't show them to me or don't download them at all.

372
00:29:18,983 --> 00:29:19,946
Rym: and both are valid.

373
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:25,303
Rym: because in the first case if You pick the don't download them, especially you have a slow connection.

374
00:29:25,343 --> 00:29:27,010
Rym: It saves you a lot of speed and bandwidth.

375
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:31,725
Scott: Yeah, dial up people that's very key is to use adblock with the don't download the ads.

376
00:29:31,946 --> 00:29:35,237
Rym: also if you're at work or something It cuts down on the number of weird domains.

377
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:39,290
Rym: Your browser may be hitting while you're at work when you should be working.

378
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:44,286
Scott: Yeah, cuz you know, you might visit Rym and Scott.com but it gets an advertisement from Penn Island.

379
00:29:44,426 --> 00:29:45,550
Scott: Yeah, Penn Island.com.

380
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:51,614
Scott: and then And it downloads.

381
00:29:51,674 --> 00:29:53,400
Scott: and you know, you might not see the ad.

382
00:29:53,441 --> 00:30:00,890
Scott: but if it downloaded the people watching what you do at work We'll see that you went to Penn Island net or calm or whatever, but you might not have wanted to go to.

383
00:30:01,392 --> 00:30:03,364
Scott: You didn't want to go to Penn Island, it's not a good place.

384
00:30:03,424 --> 00:30:06,496
Scott: Oh, it's not Unless you know you're into that sort of thing.

385
00:30:06,737 --> 00:30:08,202
Rym: Yeah, if you really like pens.

386
00:30:08,704 --> 00:30:09,526
Rym: Yeah islands.

387
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:18,709
Rym: Yeah Now the benefit of using it the other way is that some sites usually terrible sites You wouldn't want to go to anyway.

388
00:30:19,091 --> 00:30:24,450
Rym: Try to set up some logic where if the dads don't get downloaded it makes sure you can't see the content either.

389
00:30:24,972 --> 00:30:31,094
Rym: This way one you can rip off all the advertisers who I think are dumb for trying to advertise the internet in the first place By.

390
00:30:31,395 --> 00:30:32,801
Rym: they'll think you downloaded the ad.

391
00:30:32,841 --> 00:30:35,771
Rym: they'll think you saw the ad but you didn't know.

392
00:30:35,992 --> 00:30:41,636
Rym: and two if they're checking to see if you saw the ad as far as they're concerned you did and there's no way for Them to know otherwise.

393
00:30:41,837 --> 00:30:47,370
Scott: the other advantage of this method is Sometimes you'll block an ad but it's not really an ad.

394
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:53,850
Scott: Like for some website might use some pictures for its navigation and you'll accidentally add block all of them.

395
00:30:54,314 --> 00:31:00,170
Scott: Well now you've downloaded them You can just click a couple times and they'll appear instead of having to go and download them.

396
00:31:00,793 --> 00:31:04,270
Rym: Yeah, or you know refresh the page after adding a rule or removing a rule.

397
00:31:04,512 --> 00:31:06,449
Scott: Yeah, so that that's also helpful.

398
00:31:06,771 --> 00:31:10,990
Rym: Now the only drawback is that you have to do it manually which I prefer to do for a number of reasons.

399
00:31:11,775 --> 00:31:13,750
Scott: I prefer not to do it manually because I'm lazy.

400
00:31:14,231 --> 00:31:19,526
Rym: yes, also, I dislike seeing advertisements so much on the internet mostly because they annoy me.

401
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:23,750
Rym: and It's got to the point where I use such a broad brush.

402
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:27,103
Rym: Like if I see an ad I blocked the whole domain that ad came from.

403
00:31:27,966 --> 00:31:31,899
Rym: with rare exceptions I Mean I most sites I see.

404
00:31:31,939 --> 00:31:34,810
Rym: now I block almost every picture on them all those every news site.

405
00:31:35,092 --> 00:31:36,299
Rym: I just see the text.

406
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:37,003
Scott: see.

407
00:31:37,023 --> 00:31:46,506
Scott: I used to do stuff like that but then eventually a lot of sites became unnavigatable and then my rules became unmanageable and it just wasn't worth the time and effort anymore.

408
00:31:46,647 --> 00:31:48,073
Rym: see to me Unnavigable sites.

409
00:31:48,113 --> 00:31:56,103
Rym: don't bother me because I rarely ever navigate a site unless it's a site that I go to regularly in which case it's In my ad block whitelist or it usually doesn't have bad ads.

410
00:31:56,886 --> 00:32:06,318
Rym: if I go to a new site For example, I will only ever get to a news site from Google News or from Fark or from slash out or from some guys Blog and I'll only go to the one page.

411
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:06,900
Rym: They took me to.

412
00:32:07,061 --> 00:32:09,169
Scott: it's usually the blogs though that I had the problem on.

413
00:32:09,835 --> 00:32:15,470
Rym: See, I don't navigate the blogs either though I only I'll only ever get to a blog if I get to it from Fark or slash time.

414
00:32:15,611 --> 00:32:26,690
Scott: See what it is is not a common occurrence But you know once in a every week or two I like I'll find a podcast which is a blog Basically, and I'll try to go look at his old episodes and then it won't work and I'll be screwed.

415
00:32:26,991 --> 00:32:37,450
Rym: This may sound evil but for my for my perspective if I can't navigate a site Because my ad blocker your site is so much like an advertisement that my site my ad blocker blocks you.

416
00:32:38,234 --> 00:32:39,643
Rym: I don't care what you have on your site.

417
00:32:40,367 --> 00:32:43,478
Scott: All right Anyway, so how does Scott do it?

418
00:32:43,658 --> 00:32:46,346
Scott: If Rym does it manually and Scott does it automatically?

419
00:32:46,366 --> 00:32:47,730
Scott: How does Scott do it automatically?

420
00:32:48,011 --> 00:32:54,306
Scott: Well with another extension the ad block filter set dot G Updater all this is.

421
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:56,476
Scott: It's basically an extension.

422
00:32:56,516 --> 00:33:01,721
Scott: You don't have to look at or do anything with you install it you click OK and you're done what it does in.

423
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:16,049
Scott: If you have ad block or ad block plus already installed which you have to have in order for the filter set G updater to Work it will automatically manage and update your set of rules for blocking ads to block Most of the ads on the internet.

424
00:33:16,874 --> 00:33:19,227
Scott: Well, very rarely blocking things that are not ads.

425
00:33:19,629 --> 00:33:25,270
Rym: now I will note that I'm Phil just said geez great and I use it at work actually in addition to adding things manually.

426
00:33:26,111 --> 00:33:29,502
Rym: But I don't use it at home and Scott used it but way back.

427
00:33:29,542 --> 00:33:34,564
Rym: we played a game for a while called Kingdom of Loathing Mm-hmm, which is a really funny awesome game.

428
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:35,369
Rym: You've never heard of it.

429
00:33:35,932 --> 00:33:38,824
Rym: I highly recommend you play it until you get sick of it, which won't take long.

430
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:40,310
Rym: I guarantee but it's really fun.

431
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:43,330
Scott: Yeah, it's worth it for the humor and then it's not worth it anymore.

432
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:49,524
Rym: then it becomes a waste of time because then you might understand why we mispronounce certain words like Zmabi and lick.

433
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:55,864
Rym: Yes also Now anyway, the game had really funny graphics because the game is stick figures.

434
00:33:55,964 --> 00:33:57,168
Rym: Everything is poorly drawn.

435
00:33:57,228 --> 00:34:06,830
Rym: stick figures Scott because he was using the filter set G It thought that all of these pictures were ads and blocked many of them.

436
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:09,860
Rym: Thus Scott had missed much of the humor of Kingdom of Loathing.

437
00:34:10,362 --> 00:34:12,230
Scott: I did indeed miss many of the pictures.

438
00:34:12,331 --> 00:34:21,460
Rym: I saw many pictures But I also missed many of them which interestingly enough is proof to me that the pictures added something to the game because Scott Scott and I started the game at about the same time.

439
00:34:21,522 --> 00:34:23,030
Rym: I started one day after he did.

440
00:34:23,813 --> 00:34:31,665
Rym: He stopped playing about two weeks before I stopped playing And I think the only reason I played two weeks more is because the pictures were that entertaining.

441
00:34:31,705 --> 00:34:34,076
Rym: they were two weeks worth of entertainment Maybe.

442
00:34:34,096 --> 00:34:35,264
Rym: I think that's it.

443
00:34:35,567 --> 00:34:38,197
Rym: It could be See honestly though.

444
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:40,853
Rym: There aren't really many other extensions I use.

445
00:34:40,873 --> 00:34:43,949
Scott: I use a lot, but all of them see are pretty small.

446
00:34:44,371 --> 00:34:53,706
Scott: But the biggest one and the newest one that is the most important is the Google browser sync Which I've been using the hell out of lately the Google browser sync.

447
00:34:54,612 --> 00:35:08,550
Scott: what it does is you and let's say you have a laptop and a desktop and a work and a computer at work three computers Now five five five computer now three computers now you want to have the same bookmarks on all those computers.

448
00:35:09,153 --> 00:35:12,248
Scott: You want to have the same cookies on all those computers you want to have.

449
00:35:12,268 --> 00:35:12,510
Scott: you know?

450
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:19,835
Scott: Cuz like sometimes you log into a forum at home and then you want to go read the forum on your laptop But you won't be logged in.

451
00:35:19,975 --> 00:35:25,359
Scott: so you log in on the laptop and then you go back to the desktop and you're not logged in anymore over there, it's annoying.

452
00:35:25,379 --> 00:35:34,614
Scott: and You know some people save their passwords for website in Firefox and some people, you know, you'll visit a website at home You'll be at work.

453
00:35:34,895 --> 00:35:38,650
Scott: you want to look in your history to figure out what website you visited your history.

454
00:35:38,831 --> 00:35:50,070
Scott: Also, you know you want on all your computers the Google browser sync what it does when you close your web browser Takes your history your save passwords your cookies, you know all that stuff.

455
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:51,496
Scott: You can choose which ones you want.

456
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:53,325
Scott: You can actually say just do my history.

457
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:54,490
Scott: Just do my cookies.

458
00:35:55,152 --> 00:36:01,550
Scott: Just do my cookies and my bookmarks, you know, and it will take all those things and send them to Google encrypted.

459
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,798
Scott: So Google isn't looking at them, you know.

460
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:06,568
Scott: as a privacy thing, you know, it's really encrypted.

461
00:36:06,588 --> 00:36:11,907
Scott: I checked and You know, they just hold on to them for you at Google and then you visit another.

462
00:36:11,947 --> 00:36:16,590
Scott: you go home You know from work after adding a bookmark you open Firefox at home.

463
00:36:17,211 --> 00:36:23,730
Scott: It goes to Google gets your bookmarks your history and all that stuff and updates it on your home computer.

464
00:36:24,231 --> 00:36:31,650
Scott: That way all your firefoxes and all your computers will have the same bookmarks the same history the same everything and it will all stay Together and be cool.

465
00:36:32,313 --> 00:36:39,158
Scott: The only problem with this extension is that it takes longer to start up and shut down Firefox because it's talking to Google.

466
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,322
Scott: other than that.

467
00:36:40,482 --> 00:36:42,810
Scott: It's perfect and amazing and holy crap.

468
00:36:43,252 --> 00:36:46,846
Rym: I haven't used it yet, but no one's really said anything bad about it as far as I can see.

469
00:36:46,866 --> 00:36:48,973
Scott: Yep Let's see.

470
00:36:48,993 --> 00:36:51,590
Scott: What other others go down the list because a lot of these are quick nothings.

471
00:36:52,612 --> 00:36:57,700
Scott: This flash block flash block All it does is it blocks all flash.

472
00:36:58,182 --> 00:37:00,690
Scott: all flash is blocked unless you click on it.

473
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:01,112
Rym: Now.

474
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:05,130
Rym: that's great because 99% of flash on the internet is ads or crap.

475
00:37:05,907 --> 00:37:13,410
Scott: Yeah The only problem with flash block is that sometimes a website will use flash for navigation in which like the viz website is particularly bad.

476
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:16,099
Scott: So you have to say, you know, it's a flash block.

477
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,030
Scott: allow the viz.com website to use flash.

478
00:37:19,231 --> 00:37:21,143
Scott: You know allow this website to use flash.

479
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:29,370
Rym: now to me the flash It's mostly redundant because ad block for me blocks by default flash from any domain that even looks like it's an ad domain.

480
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:33,650
Scott: Yeah, the thing is that when ad block blocks flash, it makes it completely disappear.

481
00:37:34,312 --> 00:37:39,728
Scott: flash block is Sometimes we visit a website and the flash will just start playing and you wanted to.

482
00:37:39,889 --> 00:37:45,610
Scott: you know You have it in some hidden tab and you want to watch it later and then it starts spewing audio out and it's annoying.

483
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,641
Scott: You know, like I'll open up ten tabs.

484
00:37:47,681 --> 00:37:49,008
Scott: two of them have videos in them.

485
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:51,545
Scott: now I have to go find the tabs with the videos.

486
00:37:51,606 --> 00:37:52,170
Scott: stop them.

487
00:37:52,632 --> 00:37:55,730
Scott: This makes it so the flash won't start playing and true click on it.

488
00:37:55,870 --> 00:38:01,450
Scott: That's why I use flash block not to block the flash from my view but to prevent it from automatically playing right away.

489
00:38:01,851 --> 00:38:07,590
Rym: Now also bear in mind that if your website requires flash for navigating you've got problems and you shouldn't be on the internet.

490
00:38:07,631 --> 00:38:08,789
Scott: You definitely shouldn't be doing that.

491
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:15,766
Scott: I mean you can make what if someone went to your website with links or if they were blind or if they were using an old Netscape 2 or 3?

492
00:38:15,766 --> 00:38:16,390
Rym: I mean in general.

493
00:38:16,451 --> 00:38:18,310
Rym: I mean you can make cool websites with flash.

494
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:23,690
Rym: But you have to just remember that whenever you use flash you were greatly limiting your possible audience.

495
00:38:24,252 --> 00:38:30,010
Rym: You're also making it far more difficult for search engines to index your content and thus making it harder for people to find you.

496
00:38:30,231 --> 00:38:32,630
Scott: Yep, another extension to use is sage.

497
00:38:33,253 --> 00:38:36,369
Scott: It's just an RSS reader that goes in the sidebar on the left.

498
00:38:36,671 --> 00:38:39,245
Scott: You know where the bookmark sidebar and the history sidebar are.

499
00:38:39,265 --> 00:38:48,439
Scott: I mean It's a little bit more efficient for reading things like blogs that you read every day than the Firefox live bookmarks are But it's not that much better.

500
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:49,845
Scott: I just like it.

501
00:38:50,146 --> 00:38:50,789
Scott: It's it's up to you.

502
00:38:51,031 --> 00:38:54,468
Rym: Yeah, I've actually got that at work because the Firefox live bookmarks thing is kind of meh.

503
00:38:55,193 --> 00:38:57,310
Scott: It's a little bit meh and the sage is a lot.

504
00:38:57,691 --> 00:39:02,929
Rym: I think part of the problem is that RSS to me is mostly meh except in the context of podcasting.

505
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:06,469
Scott: Whatever bug me not bug me not is huge.

506
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,990
Scott: You know, yes, you know how you go to New York Times or some other news website?

507
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,999
Scott: And they say you must log in to read this story.

508
00:39:13,461 --> 00:39:16,330
Scott: Well, you don't want to go and actually register.

509
00:39:16,672 --> 00:39:17,616
Scott: It takes too damn long.

510
00:39:17,677 --> 00:39:19,546
Scott: It's not you don't want to give them your information now.

511
00:39:19,586 --> 00:39:26,250
Rym: in the old days Slash dot 2000 is a username and slash dot slash dot 2000 is a password almost always worked on every site.

512
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:31,710
Scott: Yep, but now those news websites clear out these fake passwords and usernames that everyone shares.

513
00:39:32,691 --> 00:39:35,107
Scott: So what you have to do is use bug me not.

514
00:39:35,288 --> 00:39:41,470
Scott: bug me Not is a database of names and passwords for news websites and other websites and you can just add things to it all the time.

515
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:45,150
Scott: Yeah, you can go and let's say you make a name and a password for some website.

516
00:39:45,512 --> 00:39:52,130
Scott: You can just go put it on bug me not and then other people can use bug me not To get that name and password and log in to that website.

517
00:39:52,852 --> 00:40:03,425
Scott: So let's say you go to New York Times com and it says please log in you just right-click in the username box where you would normally type in your username and click bug me not and it will go to the bug me not.

518
00:40:03,465 --> 00:40:03,967
Scott: database.

519
00:40:04,148 --> 00:40:08,607
Scott: get a name and A password and type it in for you and you just click login and you're all good to go.

520
00:40:08,627 --> 00:40:18,840
Rym: now I'll note also that there are many pay or restricted access sites that for whatever reason People have put usernames and passwords in for.

521
00:40:18,941 --> 00:40:23,676
Rym: so if you ever find a site that won't let you in and The Google cache also won't let you in.

522
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:25,181
Rym: try bug me not.

523
00:40:25,522 --> 00:40:27,650
Rym: I once got into total FARC for a few minutes with it.

524
00:40:28,031 --> 00:40:30,605
Scott: Yeah, I once got into experts exchange for a few minutes.

525
00:40:30,705 --> 00:40:39,215
Scott: Yeah, and Porn sites man, you know, it works occasionally very rarely It's it's not.

526
00:40:39,436 --> 00:40:44,256
Rym: it got I think by occasionally you mean every night from 7 and 715.

527
00:40:44,256 --> 00:40:48,772
Scott: no, no, but no, I wouldn't waste your time Willie's time I wouldn't.

528
00:40:48,972 --> 00:40:53,170
Scott: I wouldn't waste your time trying to every porn site in the universe to see if you can log in with bug me.

529
00:40:53,230 --> 00:41:01,289
Scott: Not because that's probably not worth it But if you happen to end up at a porn site that says please log in it doesn't hurt to click click bug me not.

530
00:41:02,373 --> 00:41:08,878
Rym: Now there are a million things like save tabs when you close or things that the Firefox I mean the Google browser sync.

531
00:41:08,898 --> 00:41:09,280
Scott: does that?

532
00:41:09,742 --> 00:41:09,863
Rym: Yeah.

533
00:41:09,883 --> 00:41:15,503
Rym: Well, there were a lot of extensions that Originally were extensions and then eventually things that are obviously useful.

534
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:17,570
Rym: It can just be added into Firefox every time.

535
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:25,161
Scott: Yeah, Firefox 2.0 is gonna have a spell checker making the spell check extensions useless and it's gonna have I think the tab saving when you crash.

536
00:41:25,526 --> 00:41:34,849
Rym: so Yeah things that used to be extensions are now gonna be in Firefox though I got to say a crash because I had for various reasons the computer I do GeekNights on.

537
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:43,250
Rym: I Haven't updated anything on it in over a year With few rare exceptions because the computer is honest last legs.

538
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:52,109
Rym: Anyway, it's stable and working and is behind a firewall and I'm not going to risk screwing up The only computer I have that is set up to do GeekNights until I have a new computer.

539
00:41:52,911 --> 00:41:55,844
Rym: So this computer is basically in its end-of-life steady-state cycle.

540
00:41:56,628 --> 00:42:02,006
Rym: as a result I have an old version of Firefox an old version of flash and occasionally flash will cause Firefox to crash.

541
00:42:02,046 --> 00:42:08,370
Scott: that happens to me, too Now with my new Firefox great less often than it used to the way to flash 9.

542
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:08,992
Rym: That'll solve every.

543
00:42:09,012 --> 00:42:10,619
Scott: flash 9 for Linux will solve everything.

544
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:14,974
Rym: but now I have the same flash problems in OS X. So no one gets naughty.

545
00:42:15,396 --> 00:42:16,861
Rym: only windows does flash work fully.

546
00:42:17,242 --> 00:42:19,248
Scott: Yeah, it's macro meet Adobe's fault.

547
00:42:19,409 --> 00:42:23,549
Scott: Sorry Yeah, it does nothing to do with Firefox or Windows or any operating system.

548
00:42:23,911 --> 00:42:38,790
Rym: but I was writing a post somewhere and I was kind of writing it on the fly and the post was kind of meant like it wasn't my usual it wasn't to my usual standard of posting and Then Firefox crash and it was a long post and I lost it and I was pissed.

549
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:43,567
Rym: But then I realized that it forced me to rewrite it and I rewrote it much better than it would have been.

550
00:42:43,628 --> 00:42:48,047
Rym: so the Firefox Crash made a small amount of content that I added to the world slightly better.

551
00:42:48,068 --> 00:42:55,258
Scott: Mm-hmm All right, let me just run down the rest of these real quick cuz I don't I feel bad if I left any of them out Especially for those extension creators out there.

552
00:42:55,699 --> 00:42:58,870
Rym: Yeah, by the way mad props to everyone whose extension we've talked about.

553
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:00,570
Scott: Yeah, IE tab.

554
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:06,390
Scott: This is a Windows only extension and you know Sometimes you visit a website and it doesn't work without IE IE tab.

555
00:43:06,491 --> 00:43:08,689
Scott: Just you click a button and it opens in another tab.

556
00:43:09,071 --> 00:43:14,210
Scott: But that tab even though it's in Firefox is actually IE and it works perfectly.

557
00:43:14,812 --> 00:43:16,095
Scott: So it's really great.

558
00:43:16,155 --> 00:43:20,267
Scott: instead of having to go open up Internet Explorer copy the URL blah blah blah blah blah.

559
00:43:20,448 --> 00:43:21,149
Scott: This just works.

560
00:43:22,251 --> 00:43:26,970
Scott: Web developer what this does is it adds a whole mess of buttons to the top of Firefox?

561
00:43:27,552 --> 00:43:30,460
Scott: That let you do various things which are very useful.

562
00:43:30,561 --> 00:43:41,690
Scott: if you're a web developer like you can turn the CSS off You can edit the CSS in real time You can disable Java disable JavaScript change the resolution all sorts of crazy stuff.

563
00:43:42,171 --> 00:43:42,813
Scott: So you can.

564
00:43:43,094 --> 00:43:46,606
Scott: if you're making websites, that's an essential tool.

565
00:43:46,726 --> 00:43:47,549
Scott: You can't be without it.

566
00:43:48,756 --> 00:43:50,470
Scott: Here's a little tiny one colorzilla.

567
00:43:51,092 --> 00:43:56,298
Scott: Sometimes you'd be at a website and there's a color in an image or in the text and you say wow That's a nice color.

568
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:57,229
Scott: What the hell color is that?

569
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:01,063
Scott: You just click this little eyedropper in the bottom left of Firefox.

570
00:44:01,144 --> 00:44:03,594
Scott: you click on the color and colorzilla It tells you what color it is.

571
00:44:04,116 --> 00:44:05,803
Rym: I forgot that existed until just now.

572
00:44:06,084 --> 00:44:07,630
Scott: Yeah, it's the greatest thing.

573
00:44:07,831 --> 00:44:11,470
Rym: I gotta get that again because I got it way back when you told me about it the first time and it was badass.

574
00:44:11,591 --> 00:44:14,810
Scott: I hardly ever use it, but you know that two times that I use it.

575
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:16,530
Scott: It's worth having this little tiny extension.

576
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:17,509
Rym: You know when it's really great.

577
00:44:17,891 --> 00:44:24,415
Rym: When you want to make an avatar for a forum somewhere and you want your avatars background to match the background of the forum Because they don't.

578
00:44:24,455 --> 00:44:28,110
Rym: let you use transparent ping bastards which a lot of sites don't best.

579
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:28,855
Rym: It's a lot of sites.

580
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,507
Rym: make you use JPEG or gif bastards.

581
00:44:31,215 --> 00:44:33,032
Scott: Okay, anyway Linky.

582
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:39,669
Scott: now linky is a thing that lets you do a whole bunch of different stuff with links But I really only use one feature of it text.

583
00:44:40,691 --> 00:44:40,951
Scott: No.

584
00:44:41,493 --> 00:44:42,797
Rym: Oh, that's the only thing I used it for.

585
00:44:43,078 --> 00:44:47,010
Scott: Okay, I use it for open selected links in tabs.

586
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:48,309
Rym: Oh, yeah that too.

587
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:58,686
Scott: Let's say you go to slashdot and there's a. there's an article and the article has like six links in it and you go geez And you would have to click six times to open up six tabs one with each of the articles.

588
00:44:59,188 --> 00:45:02,222
Scott: with linky You can just select the whole art.

589
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:11,350
Scott: the whole little slashdot thing You know is a big Highlight the whole thing and click two times and it'll open up all the links in the highlighted area in new tabs.

590
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:13,285
Scott: That's it saves so many clicks.

591
00:45:13,346 --> 00:45:13,829
Scott: It's crazy.

592
00:45:15,251 --> 00:45:17,990
Scott: Here's one that not a lot of people know about which is pretty clever.

593
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:24,049
Scott: It's FXIF and it allows you to view the EXIF data in images.

594
00:45:24,109 --> 00:45:25,433
Scott: now friend who doesn't know?

595
00:45:25,533 --> 00:45:28,662
Scott: EXIF is sort of like ID3 for pictures.

596
00:45:29,203 --> 00:45:43,109
Scott: if you go on flickr and you start looking at the EXIF of different photos you'll see You know who what camera took the pictures who took them maybe what time they were taken all sorts of information.

597
00:45:43,149 --> 00:45:47,509
Scott: So It's really funny to go to like a news website and you look at the EXIF.

598
00:45:47,871 --> 00:45:55,368
Scott: Or you go to a blog and you look at the EXIF on their images and you go Aha, and occasionally it's very very interesting most of the time.

599
00:45:55,408 --> 00:46:00,729
Scott: It's just boring Yeah, but you know when there's a picture roaming around the internet you can say where did that come from?

600
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:02,376
Scott: Aha, that's where it came from.

601
00:46:02,959 --> 00:46:03,903
Scott: I know what that is.

602
00:46:03,923 --> 00:46:05,370
Rym: I see what you did there.

603
00:46:05,511 --> 00:46:08,266
Scott: Yeah, so like if you found the original goatse you can see who took it.

604
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:11,515
Scott: maybe yeah Reload every.

605
00:46:11,656 --> 00:46:16,697
Scott: now, sometimes you visit a website that doesn't update on its own But you know, you're like.

606
00:46:16,877 --> 00:46:23,759
Scott: maybe it says like in 10 minutes the grand opening and you know You want to watch and wait you're waiting on a website for something to happen.

607
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:30,516
Scott: You can say reload this tab every 10 seconds and Reload every allows you to do that.

608
00:46:31,098 --> 00:46:34,209
Scott: It's not useful often, but sometimes very very useful.

609
00:46:34,229 --> 00:46:39,669
Scott: a Lot better than sitting around going reload reload, you know when I use that last e3.

610
00:46:40,911 --> 00:46:42,175
Rym: Yeah, I haven't used it since.

611
00:46:42,436 --> 00:46:46,710
Scott: that's when I used it on e3 because there was a. that was that website with all the e3 news.

612
00:46:46,991 --> 00:46:52,934
Scott: I uninstalled it after e3 and I said reload this every minute and then every time there was new e3 news I went there.

613
00:46:52,955 --> 00:46:56,253
Scott: it is Screen grab.

614
00:46:56,333 --> 00:46:58,359
Scott: this is actually pretty useful because what it does?

615
00:46:58,379 --> 00:47:02,350
Scott: it allows you to take a screenshot of just the website you're on.

616
00:47:03,152 --> 00:47:09,010
Scott: So, you know how sometimes you want to take a screenshot of a website you take a screenshot of the Firefox window.

617
00:47:09,131 --> 00:47:17,310
Scott: Then you to cut the website out or maybe the website is so long You'd have to take a screenshot of the website scroll down take another screenshot paste them together.

618
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:18,815
Rym: I hate doing that so much.

619
00:47:19,177 --> 00:47:23,010
Scott: screen grab allows you to just take the screenshot of the whole website in one click.

620
00:47:23,091 --> 00:47:24,525
Scott: but there it is perfect.

621
00:47:24,546 --> 00:47:30,170
Scott: and The last extension I have is dig this which is just like delicious, but it digs.

622
00:47:31,251 --> 00:47:36,330
Scott: That's all it does is it is one button to go to your dig and a button to dig something great.

623
00:47:37,073 --> 00:47:48,029
Scott: I don't think we have any meta bits for today simply because we're mostly preparing for Otakon Yep, so if any of those Firefox extensions dry strike your fancy go install them from add-ons not my zilla org Yep.

624
00:47:48,231 --> 00:48:06,342
Rym: and if once again if you're interested in seeing Scott and I live either go to Otakon or Don't see us live until the next con we go to and that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
