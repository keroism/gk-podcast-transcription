1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,010
Scott: It's Thursday, February 23rd, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:17,160
Scott: Tonight, we talk about how not to suck at driving.

3
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,298
Scott: Let's do this!

4
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,600
Rym: So yesterday, I did my Katsucon coverage, and I was sick, and I'm slightly less sick today.

5
00:00:24,921 --> 00:00:28,336
Rym: And there's one quick thing I forgot about, and that's- You forgot about something.

6
00:00:28,376 --> 00:00:29,260
Rym: Yeah, I forgot one thing.

7
00:00:29,601 --> 00:00:30,063
Scott: Oh my god.

8
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:32,994
Rym: MC Chris did a concert at Katsucon.

9
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:34,400
Scott: That's the guy who sings Fett's Vet.

10
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,550
Rym: Yeah, Fett's Vet and Robitussin.

11
00:00:37,373 --> 00:00:40,588
Scott: That guy's- if you haven't heard this guy, he sings mad nerdy raps.

12
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:41,493
Rym: Awesome style.

13
00:00:41,573 --> 00:00:41,935
Rym: And you know what?

14
00:00:41,955 --> 00:00:43,060
Rym: He's a mad nerdy guy.

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,019
Scott: It's awesome.

16
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,046
Rym: So the concert was awesome.

17
00:00:46,066 --> 00:00:56,852
Rym: I mean, he got up on stage, he did a full set, which basically is him, he'll sing a song, and then he'll basically- his thing seems to be like Black Power, Black Panthers, only replace that with the word

18
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:57,297
Rym: "nerd.".

19
00:00:57,761 --> 00:00:58,183
Scott: Oh, right.

20
00:00:58,264 --> 00:00:59,512
Scott: So, wait, wait, wait, wait.

21
00:00:59,532 --> 00:01:00,780
Scott: So, Black Nerds?

22
00:01:01,181 --> 00:01:02,324
Rym: Nah.

23
00:01:02,965 --> 00:01:06,513
Rym: It was basically like, "Burn the frat houses down!

24
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:07,135
Rym: Yeah!

25
00:01:07,436 --> 00:01:08,278
Rym: Nerd power!

26
00:01:08,598 --> 00:01:08,899
Rym: Nerd

27
00:01:08,919 --> 00:01:09,280
Rym: power!".

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,289
Rym: And he was working the crowd up, and then he'd sing a song, then he'd give another inflammatory speech, and then he'd sing another song.

29
00:01:14,873 --> 00:01:24,040
Rym: Alright, so- And after he did his set, he walked off, and people were screaming his name, and he walks back on, and he does one more song, and then- Of course, you gotta do that.

30
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:29,846
Rym: And then he announces to the crowd that he will not leave until he has shook everyone's hand who is currently in the concert.

31
00:01:30,349 --> 00:01:33,770
Rym: And then he sets up a table, and everyone in the concert follows by and shakes his hand.

32
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:34,980
Scott: Alright.

33
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,679
Rym: And he was signing stuff, and he got a few things for sale, I think.

34
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,139
Rym: I actually didn't stand in line, because I had other things to do.

35
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,211
Scott: You shake his hand?

36
00:01:41,232 --> 00:01:41,477
Scott: Nah.

37
00:01:42,221 --> 00:01:44,400
Scott: Oh, but he- guys, he's still sitting there, right?

38
00:01:45,441 --> 00:01:49,640
Rym: Well, he left when the line ended, and by the time the line ended, I was already off doing other things at the con.

39
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:50,183
Scott: Ah.

40
00:01:50,921 --> 00:01:53,095
Rym: It was late at night on Saturday, I was a little bit drunk.

41
00:01:53,195 --> 00:01:53,940
Rym: By little, I mean a lot.

42
00:01:54,922 --> 00:01:57,040
Rym: I was wandering around interviewing people for GeekNights.

43
00:01:58,082 --> 00:02:04,480
Rym: So about the time when he finished was about the time I was wandering around in the sub-basement, interviewing all those hotel staff that I talked about yesterday.

44
00:02:05,582 --> 00:02:05,622
Scott: Mm.

45
00:02:05,702 --> 00:02:09,600
Scott: We'll have to give a link to him, and I think he has some MP3s for download on his site.

46
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:14,180
Scott: Download at least the Fets Vet MP3, which is his best song.

47
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,920
Rym: Yeah, Fets Vet, as in Boba Fett financing his vet, as in Corvette Vroom.

48
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,396
Scott: As in that thing that, you know, takes off and fly- you know.

49
00:02:21,496 --> 00:02:21,999
Scott: Yeah, you get it.

50
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,719
Scott: What's his ship called again?

51
00:02:24,282 --> 00:02:25,420
Rym: Oh, hah, Slave One.

52
00:02:25,602 --> 00:02:26,678
Scott: That's right, that's right.

53
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,308
Rym: I can't believe you didn't remember that.

54
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:29,819
Rym: You're like the biggest Boba Fett fan.

55
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,886
Scott: I'm not the biggest Boba Fett fan.

56
00:02:31,927 --> 00:02:35,305
Scott: I mean, he just looks cool, and he has some cool weapons, and- Oh, here's a question.

57
00:02:35,346 --> 00:02:37,200
Rym: When in Star Wars did Boba Fett first appear?

58
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,320
Rym: What was his first appearance in the Star Wars universe?

59
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,400
Scott: Well, it was in Episode 4, when Darth Vader was interviewing all the bounty hunters, right?

60
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:44,620
Scott: Ah, maybe.

61
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,361
Scott: Oh, wait, wait, wait, was that Episode 5?

62
00:02:46,361 --> 00:02:47,380
Scott: Okay, no, no, no, that's right!

63
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:54,639
Scott: In Episode 4, in the added scene, at the end of the added scene in the special edition, he comes at the end of the added scene and just looks at the screen.

64
00:02:55,202 --> 00:03:05,280
Scott: In Episode 5, you first see him when Darth Vader's interviewing bounty hunters, to auditioning bounty hunters, I guess, to go get, um, you know, the good guys.

65
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,620
Rym: Well, um, I'm not gonna answer the question as to when he actually appeared.

66
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,920
Rym: We'll see if any of our listeners will post in the forum.

67
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:16,359
Scott: He might have appeared- you know what, if someone's nerdier than me, they'll know that he appeared in, like, the background of some scene.

68
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,720
Rym: Or in, like, the, uh, Christmas special, or something.

69
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,123
Scott: The Christmas special didn't come before Episode 5.

70
00:03:23,123 --> 00:03:23,433
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

71
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,219
Scott: I don't think it did, anyway, there's no way.

72
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,940
Scott: All I'm saying is that- It couldn't have, because there were Ewoks in it, right?

73
00:03:28,282 --> 00:03:28,999
Scott: No, no, were there?

74
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:29,778
Scott: There were at least Wookies.

75
00:03:30,261 --> 00:03:31,119
Rym: There were a lot of Wookies.

76
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,099
Scott: Too many Wookies.

77
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:35,779
Scott: [laughter] We'll talk about that some other time.

78
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,130
Rym: Yep.

79
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,399
Rym: The Okazukan's done, but we got many more conventions coming up.

80
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:39,789
Rym: Yep.

81
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,460
Scott: This Saturday- I don't know, I've said it enough times, but in case- this is the only- if you're brand new to the podcast, guess what?

82
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,899
Scott: This Saturday, as in, uh, what- Two days from now.

83
00:03:51,102 --> 00:03:51,191
Scott: Yeah.

84
00:03:51,805 --> 00:03:53,440
Scott: Well, the convention actually starts tomorrow.

85
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,809
Scott: But, uh, today is February 23rd.

86
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:06,220
Scott: From February 24th through the 26th, the New York Comic Con is happening at the Jacob Javits Center in New York City.

87
00:04:07,026 --> 00:04:08,879
Rym: I will be there- I might be there.

88
00:04:09,261 --> 00:04:14,073
Scott: On the 25th, Saturday only, because- Why do I wanna go all three days?

89
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:14,416
Scott: I don't know.

90
00:04:16,021 --> 00:04:21,639
Scott: Uh, expect to see me hanging out with people who, uh, listen to Comic Geek speak, because I listen to them too.

91
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,759
Rym: And he wants to yell at them, and they'll yell back at him.

92
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,880
Scott: Yeah, and expect me to, uh, Douglas Rushkoff's gonna be there, so I'm gonna probably go see him sometime.

93
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,537
Rym: Well, you won his contest, so...

94
00:04:31,941 --> 00:04:34,580
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure- I think he kinda knows who I am, kinda.

95
00:04:35,821 --> 00:04:38,457
Rym: If you say, "Hey, I won your contest, I wrote about, uh,

96
00:04:38,477 --> 00:04:38,739
Rym: yeah.".

97
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:43,080
Scott: He has a panel, but I don't think I'm gonna go to his panel, but I'll go- I think he's signing stuff.

98
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,280
Scott: I'll get him to sign, uh, his comic that he's writing.

99
00:04:48,243 --> 00:04:54,999
Scott: And Minmay, AK- uh, well, actually, it's, uh, Mari Ichima- I think that's how you say her name, I don't know.

100
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:06,478
Scott: The original Lin Minmay from Macross, who's also currently, uh, doing, like, a big US tour to pimp her music, and the redubbing of Macross by ADV.

101
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:11,420
Scott: She's gonna, like, sing some songs around noon, I think, in, like, the lobby or something.

102
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:22,939
Scott: But, uh, she's also- they're doing this anime exodus thing at night, where they're gonna bust people over to the knitting factory for, like, her singing, and someone else singing, and then DJing.

103
00:05:23,901 --> 00:05:28,119
Scott: And I kinda wanna go, and I would go if I brought people with me.

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,240
Scott: The problem is, I'm gonna have a bunch of comic shit carrying, and I don't really wanna carry it to this nightclub.

105
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,745
Rym: Huh.

106
00:05:35,987 --> 00:05:38,699
Rym: See, I'm not gonna really buy anything at the concert, I don't have to worry about that.

107
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:44,780
Scott: Yeah, it's just, you know, even if I just- it'll fit in a backpack, probably, but I don't wanna go to a nightclub with a backpack.

108
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:47,480
Rym: You could rent a locker at the Port Authority.

109
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,600
Scott: Yeah, I don't really wanna do that.

110
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,418
Rym: Oh, rent a bus locker?

111
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,266
Scott: That's, like, out of the way.

112
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:55,980
Scott: The knitting factory's way down, and the Javits Center's in the middle, and the Port Authority's up from there.

113
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,700
Rym: I'm sure there's somewhere else you can rent a locker.

114
00:05:58,721 --> 00:06:04,900
Scott: You know, this is- a lot of people I know get memberships at, actually, the New York Sports Club, because you can get showers and lockers there.

115
00:06:05,321 --> 00:06:08,806
Scott: But I don't- I wouldn't- I don't go there often enough for it to be worth it now, and- Oh, yeah.

116
00:06:09,961 --> 00:06:10,242
Scott: You know.

117
00:06:10,564 --> 00:06:13,979
Scott: Even when I worked there, I would've used that maybe four times, five times.

118
00:06:14,643 --> 00:06:18,419
Rym: Well, you know, I've gone to many a back- oh, a nightclub with a backpack, and it's not that big a deal.

119
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,800
Scott: Yeah, it- it just might suck, so I don't- We're not gonna be rockin' to Lynn Minmay so much.

120
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:33,860
Scott: Yeah, but, you know, if I go, I might wanna stay for all the DJ happening, because then it's- you have to pay fifteen extra dollars to do this, in addition to your con membership.

121
00:06:34,141 --> 00:06:37,840
Rym: You know, I've paid more to get into crappier clubs for less, uh, stellar events.

122
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,160
Scott: Yeah, maybe I can go, and, like, she'll sing, and I'll stand around while she sings.

123
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:50,499
Scott: You know, just, like, sit in the back and not really be into it, and then leave after- but when the DJing starts, 'cause then I can go home or- I will see, the trains run until one-thirty, so.

124
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:57,339
Scott: Oh, yeah, if we stay for all the DJing, we're totally gonna be, uh, Sleeping on the streets of New York City like we did for the, uh- Yeah, missing all the trains.

125
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:57,751
Rym: Yeah.

126
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:06,620
Scott: So, actually, no wait, my cousin lives now on, like, First or Second Avenue, so if I went all the way- What, in Manhattan?

127
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:07,690
Scott: Yeah, I'm like- Really?

128
00:07:08,901 --> 00:07:13,120
Scott: Yeah, she lives in, like, a tiny box with, like, three other girls, but it's, like, a really nice building.

129
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,139
Rym: Three other girls, eh?

130
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:16,099
Scott: Or two or three other girls, I don't know.

131
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:16,326
Scott: Eh.

132
00:07:17,142 --> 00:07:21,340
Rym: I have no idea, but- Alright, well, that's all, you know, stuff we'll talk about after we finish recording.

133
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,223
Scott: Yeah, that's not the point.

134
00:07:22,344 --> 00:07:29,099
Scott: Saturday, as two days from now, New York Comic Con, if you'll be there, uh, Saturday, you can find us.

135
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,160
Scott: We're- it might be really crowded, but we're obvious.

136
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,720
Rym: Yeah, we're- I mean, we- like I said, we ran into some people who knew us at KatsuCon.

137
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:38,860
Rym: Me and the other Scott, not this Scott.

138
00:07:39,222 --> 00:07:41,920
Rym: But it's real hard to miss us at any public event.

139
00:07:43,267 --> 00:07:44,178
Rym: Just trust me.

140
00:07:45,860 --> 00:08:01,480
Rym: Alright, so, in the news, Gervais Markham, who is the licensing dude for the Mozilla Free Software Foundation, or the Mozilla Foundation, got an email from a woman who works for the trading standards department in the UK.

141
00:08:02,561 --> 00:08:08,740
Rym: And she was very happy that they had caught some retailer, or someone, selling Firefox CDs.

142
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,560
Rym: And she wanted to get their permission to press charges and confiscate them and go through all that rigmarole.

143
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,840
Scott: But you're allowed to sell Firefox CDs.

144
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,253
Rym: Yeah, so he responded to her, saying, "Um, they're perfectly within their rights to do that.

145
00:08:21,474 --> 00:08:23,580
Rym: As per our license, there's no problem.

146
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:27,737
Rym: Uh, please, if you confiscated anything, give it back and let them do whatever they want to

147
00:08:27,777 --> 00:08:27,857
Rym: do.".

148
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:28,565
Scott: Mhm.

149
00:08:29,282 --> 00:08:31,531
Rym: Um, this was not well received, apparently.

150
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:41,554
Rym: And her reply, now here's a quote, "I can't believe that your company would allow people to make money from something that you allow people to have free access to.

151
00:08:41,976 --> 00:08:42,677
Rym: Is this really the

152
00:08:42,697 --> 00:08:42,998
Rym: case?".

153
00:08:44,345 --> 00:08:45,216
Scott: People just don't get it.

154
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,059
Scott: Free means free, as in, you can do whatever the hell you want with it.

155
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:59,700
Scott: And because it clashes with their preconceived notions of, you know, being a greedy assfuck, they just can't believe that anyone is really that benevolent.

156
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,400
Rym: No, she went on, "If Mozilla permit the sale of copyrighted versions...".

157
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,210
Rym: This is all, uh, in context.

158
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,059
Rym: I'm not altering the grammar in any way.

159
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:21,979
Rym: "If Mozilla permit the sale of copied versions of its software, it makes it virtually impossible for us, from a practical point of view, to enforce UK anti-piracy legislation, as it is difficult for us to give general advice to businesses over what is and is not

160
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:22,260
Rym: permitted.".

161
00:09:23,185 --> 00:09:23,699
Scott: That's true.

162
00:09:24,142 --> 00:09:28,157
Rym: Now, at this point, Gervais, I mean, he is the guy for the Mozilla Foundation.

163
00:09:28,358 --> 00:09:28,840
Rym: He's the dude.

164
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:34,700
Rym: So he starts telling her about all the other free software out there, and how it's not just Mozilla.

165
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,020
Rym: He talked about OpenOffice, he talked about Linux, and she didn't believe him.

166
00:09:39,441 --> 00:09:42,300
Rym: In fact, she didn't even believe, at this point, that he actually worked for Mozilla.

167
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:51,317
Rym: She thought he was some sort of imposter, and he had to convince her that he really was the guy, and that he- Just send her a copy, send her a link to the new public license version 2, and say, "Read it.

168
00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:52,160
Rym: Read what it

169
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:52,280
Rym: says.".

170
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,520
Rym: This woman doesn't sound so bright.

171
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,008
Scott: Oh yeah, but get your ear, get your lawyer to read this and ask them.

172
00:09:57,288 --> 00:10:01,299
Scott: Don't even, you know, doesn't matter what I say, there's the official thing, right there, read it.

173
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:11,900
Rym: So basically, it seems like people out there in the industries really can't seem to grasp the fact that things aren't the way they used to, and there are indeed things that are free.

174
00:10:12,581 --> 00:10:13,179
Rym: Actually free.

175
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:25,920
Scott: Well, this reminds me of actually a story, but it's not really a story, it's when I was taking this class called Computer, I think it was Computer Security something.

176
00:10:27,261 --> 00:10:31,920
Scott: It was actually a liberal arts class, with this, the teacher was the original McGruff.

177
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,700
Scott: He was like a cop, and then he was in charge of cyber crime, I was right, it was the frickin' class, cyber crime something.

178
00:10:40,462 --> 00:10:45,840
Scott: He was in charge of cyber crime for the entire federal government, you know, something, justice department.

179
00:10:46,821 --> 00:10:51,900
Scott: He was a real important guy, and he became an RIT professor, and he was in charge of the security club, and whatever.

180
00:10:52,921 --> 00:10:57,300
Scott: So, in this class, they spent like a day or two talking about free software.

181
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:04,559
Scott: So of course, you know, I gave everyone the lowdown, there were probably two or three other kids in the class who could have done it as well, you know, as RIT.

182
00:11:07,182 --> 00:11:13,240
Scott: So, there was one sort of older lady in the class, like 30, 40, old, you know, a middle-aged woman.

183
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:18,200
Rym: You know, not to stereotype, but I have many stories about those types who were in my IT classes, and they always cause trouble.

184
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:24,140
Scott: Oh yeah, because they don't learn as easily as us, you know, punk kids, and they have their old ways.

185
00:11:25,062 --> 00:11:27,199
Rym: That wasn't what I was going to say, but go with that.

186
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:35,335
Scott: Yeah, so after I explained it, she was like, "So, so why do you do, why do you give it away for free?

187
00:11:35,355 --> 00:11:37,740
Scott: You do this hard work, why don't you get money for

188
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:37,800
Scott: it?".

189
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,078
Scott: I'm like, "Because I'm not a greedy ass

190
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:40,280
Scott: fuck.".

191
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,040
Rym: Did you actually say "greedy ass fuck" in class?

192
00:11:43,282 --> 00:11:43,649
Scott: I think I said

193
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,139
Scott: "asshole.".

194
00:11:44,701 --> 00:11:45,859
Rym: Alright, good, good, good.

195
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:53,220
Scott: You know, and she was just like completely dumbfounded, and the explanation the teacher gave, whether it's true or not, seemed really smart.

196
00:11:54,022 --> 00:12:00,015
Scott: He was comparing the hacker ethic to the old-fashioned Christian work ethic.

197
00:12:00,115 --> 00:12:02,200
Scott: Not Christian as in the religion, but, you know.

198
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,600
Rym: You know, quote Christian, like the old Puritan work ethic, all that.

199
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:16,399
Scott: Yeah, so, and he was like, "These people still have that old work ethic, and you people have the hacker ethic, and the world's changing to the hacker ethic, and that's the way it

200
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:16,540
Scott: is.".

201
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,327
Rym: I mean, the hacker ethic is very simple.

202
00:12:18,668 --> 00:12:21,519
Rym: Don't hurt other people, do what you find fun, help people when you can.

203
00:12:22,246 --> 00:12:23,519
Rym: Oh, and tinker with things.

204
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,716
Scott: Yeah, there's more to it, but...

205
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,920
Rym: Yeah, the hacker ethic is very broad and ill-defined.

206
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:34,000
Scott: Well, no, there's like a list, you can pretty much make like a list of things that define each of these two things and compare them, and they're pretty much the exact opposite.

207
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:43,134
Scott: So go online, and go read about the Christian work ethic and the hacker ethic, and there's actually a book all about the hacker ethic.

208
00:12:43,394 --> 00:12:46,038
Scott: you can go read, and it's pretty good, actually.

209
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:46,980
Scott: I read part of it once.

210
00:12:47,841 --> 00:13:04,300
Rym: Though I wonder if incidents like this, because I found it disturbing that this woman and this institution, it looks like it's a UK government institution, was giving advice to businesses on what they can or cannot do with regards to software and copyright, but they were assuming that all software is proprietary and can't be copied.

211
00:13:04,721 --> 00:13:09,080
Rym: And they basically didn't seem to be aware of the fact that free software exists at all.

212
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:15,898
Scott: Well, I think they were aware of the fact that free software existed, because she said, "People are selling something you give away for

213
00:13:15,938 --> 00:13:16,098
Scott: free!".

214
00:13:17,761 --> 00:13:24,075
Scott: And the advice they were probably giving to companies was, "For open source software, use it all you want.

215
00:13:24,155 --> 00:13:26,080
Scott: For proprietary software, don't buy

216
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,160
Scott: it.".

217
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:36,678
Scott: And because people might be selling free software, now it gets really difficult to explain to a company easily what to do.

218
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,144
Rym: It's like, "Should you buy this?

219
00:13:39,164 --> 00:13:39,866
Scott: Should you get it for

220
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:40,227
Scott: free?".

221
00:13:40,327 --> 00:13:45,038
Scott: That means you have to pretty much give companies a list of all the software in the world, which you can't do.

222
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:45,680
Scott: It's not reasonable.

223
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,442
Rym: Well, you know what that means?

224
00:13:46,482 --> 00:13:52,880
Rym: It means our copyright law is so Byzantine that there's really no way to simply summarize it to anyone anymore.

225
00:13:53,381 --> 00:13:54,299
Scott: No, no there isn't.

226
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,964
Rym: Because we could license GeekNights however we wanted.

227
00:13:57,285 --> 00:14:05,820
Rym: We could say that you have to give us a one-legged dog for every episode that we let you listen to, and if you cut off your finger, you're allowed to spread that episode to two other people.

228
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,402
Scott: Let's do it.

229
00:14:07,642 --> 00:14:11,132
Rym: Now, you might say, "No, that's stupid," but that's fine.

230
00:14:11,413 --> 00:14:13,639
Rym: It's our right to give a stupid license, it's your right to ignore it.

231
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:19,200
Rym: Luckily, for all of you who don't know, we're out under the Creative Commons license, almost entirely unrestricted.

232
00:14:20,161 --> 00:14:22,951
Rym: You can do anything you want with GeekNights, anything in the world.

233
00:14:23,252 --> 00:14:25,600
Rym: The only restriction is that you have to share and share alike.

234
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:34,657
Scott: Yeah, so if you start giving GeekNights to people, then those people have to also be willing to give GeekNights to other people.

235
00:14:34,697 --> 00:14:36,000
Scott: They can't keep it to themselves.

236
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,160
Rym: Well, I guess they can keep it to themselves because they're not forced to give it to other people.

237
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:39,838
Rym: That's true.

238
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,749
Rym: But if you created a derivative work, like say you remixed something we said into a techno song.

239
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,480
Rym: That's fine, but other people are allowed to remix your techno song into other techno songs now.

240
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:55,097
Scott: Yeah, and you can't make a techno song remix of what we say and then charge a dollar for it.

241
00:14:55,137 --> 00:14:56,260
Scott: You have to just give it away.

242
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,240
Rym: Unless we gave you permission, because we can give permission for anything we want.

243
00:14:59,400 --> 00:14:59,841
Scott: Oh, yeah, sure.

244
00:15:00,182 --> 00:15:03,069
Scott: The other thing is you have to sell people where it came from.

245
00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:04,793
Scott: You have to be like, "This is GeekNights, Scott and

246
00:15:04,834 --> 00:15:05,014
Scott: Rym.".

247
00:15:05,034 --> 00:15:06,678
Scott: You can't be like, "Yeah, this is me.

248
00:15:06,758 --> 00:15:06,999
Scott: I did

249
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:07,199
Scott: this.".

250
00:15:07,501 --> 00:15:09,380
Rym: Yeah, we're not a public domain.

251
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,153
Scott: Yeah, you have to tell people who it is.

252
00:15:12,193 --> 00:15:12,475
Scott: That's it.

253
00:15:12,535 --> 00:15:13,380
Scott: You can do anything else you want.

254
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:14,302
Rym: You know what?

255
00:15:14,322 --> 00:15:18,874
Rym: I hereby state that the following four words I say are in the public domain.

256
00:15:19,796 --> 00:15:21,460
Rym: I couldn't even think of four funny words to say.

257
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,819
Scott: Well, it's the four words you just said.

258
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:23,999
Rym: I couldn't even think.

259
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:24,468
Scott: Yeah.

260
00:15:27,442 --> 00:15:28,566
Rym: All right, so what's this other news?

261
00:15:28,586 --> 00:15:30,272
Rym: you got about some DHCP Linux?

262
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:32,420
Rym: Something most of our listeners don't know or care about?

263
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,923
Scott: Well, okay, they might know or care.

264
00:15:35,524 --> 00:15:39,430
Scott: DHCP, if you don't know, is the way your computer gets an IP address.

265
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:46,020
Scott: You might do it the old-fashioned way, where you just type in an IP address, and that's the one your computer tries to use, but no one does it that way anymore.

266
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,435
Scott: The way it works, basically, is the DHCP server, you say, "Hey, what IP address are you going to give

267
00:15:50,455 --> 00:15:50,555
Scott: me?".

268
00:15:50,595 --> 00:15:51,800
Scott: It gives you one, and that's the one you get.

269
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,134
Rym: Yep, if you're using an ISP or anything, they just do that automatically.

270
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,420
Rym: You probably don't even have to do anything.

271
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:08,260
Scott: Most people don't even know what the hell this is going on, but the point of it is, whenever you connect a computer to the internet, it uses DHCP to get the IP address, whether it's a wireless, a wire, whatever, okay?

272
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:24,280
Scott: So, in Linux, you have this weird kind of setup, where the kernel knows how to do DHCP, but you have to have a userland program to actually tell the kernel to do DHCP and, you know, all that stuff.

273
00:16:24,921 --> 00:16:33,478
Scott: So the program that you use when the computer starts up to talk to the Linux kernel to tell it to use DHCP, and it talks back to you and says, "This happened,".

274
00:16:33,518 --> 00:16:34,240
Scott: and you talk to it.

275
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:42,080
Scott: Now, the way it's worked for a while now is the only DHCP program that was worth a shit is DHCP CD.

276
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,319
Rym: So if you're running Linux, I guarantee to you that's what you're using right now.

277
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:52,695
Scott: Yeah, there's a program called DHCP CD, and what it does is it says, "Hey, kernel, I want an IP address.

278
00:16:52,775 --> 00:16:53,897
Scott: Hey, kernel, I want an IP address,".

279
00:16:53,917 --> 00:16:54,558
Scott: and then it gets one.

280
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:55,099
Scott: It says, "I got an IP

281
00:16:55,119 --> 00:16:55,300
Scott: address.".

282
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,605
Scott: And then it says, "Hey, kernel, is it working?

283
00:16:57,665 --> 00:16:58,187
Scott: Hey, kernel, is it

284
00:16:58,207 --> 00:16:58,368
Scott: working?".

285
00:16:58,388 --> 00:17:01,800
Scott: It just keeps asking the kernel to make sure the DHCP server is all right.

286
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:09,380
Rym: Now, it works, but it doesn't work as well as it could, and there are a lot of annoyances in that it doesn't always react to IP address changes.

287
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:15,339
Rym: Like, you know in Windows, you unplug your network cable, you plug it right back in, everything just starts working again?

288
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:24,498
Scott: In Linux, if you unplug your network cable and plug it back in, you have to tell DHCP CD, "Hey, we lost the connection there, and we lost the IP address.

289
00:17:24,617 --> 00:17:25,138
Scott: Get a new

290
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:25,359
Scott: one.".

291
00:17:25,701 --> 00:17:27,819
Scott: It doesn't get a new one on its own, because it doesn't know shit.

292
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:35,920
Scott: Now, a lot of people use ifplugd, which is a program that watches to see if the wire gets unplugged.

293
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:42,140
Scott: And if the wire gets unplugged, then ifplugd automatically tells the DHCP thing to do its trick.

294
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,640
Rym: Now, that's fine, but that is very obviously a hackish way of getting around this problem.

295
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,065
Rym: Yeah, you're using two programs.

296
00:17:47,286 --> 00:17:50,860
Scott: One program's purpose is just to watch and manage this original program.

297
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,124
Rym: Actually, I got a thing.

298
00:17:52,164 --> 00:17:56,700
Rym: I can't really give the details, but at work, we have a web server that's old and crappy, and it's going to go away soon.

299
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,419
Scott: And you have a program that watches it, and when it goes down, it restarts it?

300
00:17:59,604 --> 00:17:59,816
Scott: Yes.

301
00:18:00,222 --> 00:18:00,588
Scott: Awesome.

302
00:18:00,812 --> 00:18:01,259
Scott: I love those.

303
00:18:01,701 --> 00:18:07,020
Rym: We have the web server, then we have this thing we call keepwebalive, and it checks the web and keeps it alive.

304
00:18:07,981 --> 00:18:08,500
Rym: It's hilarious.

305
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,299
Scott: You know, I bet you half the time, it's checking brings it down.

306
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,647
Rym: No, no, we actually know that it works pretty well.

307
00:18:13,687 --> 00:18:15,957
Rym: This server is old and crap, and it's going away, so...

308
00:18:16,864 --> 00:18:17,138
Scott: All right.

309
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:17,453
Rym: Yeah.

310
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:26,720
Scott: So, some guys in the Linux kernel department, I think in the very recent version, like 2.6.17, which I'm not even using a new one like that yet.

311
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:37,820
Scott: I'm using like 2.6.15, is making it so that when the network connection goes down, the kernel will actually tell the DHCP program, "Hey, the connection went

312
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,020
Scott: down.".

313
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:46,260
Scott: So the DHCP program now can do and get IP addresses and re-get them and retry all on its own in a smart, intelligent way.

314
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,699
Rym: Now, some people aren't very happy with this.

315
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:59,200
Scott: Well, the thing is, is the DHCP CD, the current DHCP program, isn't updated, so it doesn't give a shit about the kernel telling it that the connection went down.

316
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,243
Scott: It just doesn't do anything.

317
00:19:00,544 --> 00:19:05,840
Scott: You know, it's not programmed to do anything when it gets those commands from the kernel.

318
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:12,011
Scott: So, one guy says, "Let's write a new DHCP program and get rid of DHCP

319
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:12,411
Scott: CD.".

320
00:19:12,972 --> 00:19:15,798
Scott: And I said to this, "Hooray!

321
00:19:15,818 --> 00:19:15,958
Scott: Woo-hoo!".

322
00:19:17,081 --> 00:19:19,076
Rym: But some other people said, "You can't do that.

323
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:19,317
Rym: That's

324
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:19,680
Rym: stupid.".

325
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,249
Scott: Well, they didn't say, "You can't do

326
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:21,389
Scott: that.".

327
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,616
Scott: They said, "You shouldn't do

328
00:19:22,656 --> 00:19:22,797
Scott: that.".

329
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:34,659
Scott: Now, some of the guys have a somewhat legitimate thing to say, and that's, "Why bother writing a new one when you could just add the feature to DHCP

330
00:19:34,699 --> 00:19:34,899
Scott: CD?".

331
00:19:35,481 --> 00:19:36,745
Scott: And I said, "Okay.

332
00:19:37,769 --> 00:19:38,894
Scott: That makes a little sense.

333
00:19:39,215 --> 00:19:39,415
Scott: Yeah.".

334
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:49,620
Scott: And another guy says, "The old DHCP client has a lot of features and other things in use, and it'll take quite a bit of time to update

335
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:49,760
Scott: them.".

336
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:56,960
Scott: So, I don't really understand what that complaint is, because, well, sure, it's gonna take time to write it.

337
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,409
Scott: You keep using the old one until the new one's done.

338
00:19:59,429 --> 00:19:59,830
Scott: What do you think?

339
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,620
Scott: You just start using a new one before it's finished?

340
00:20:03,381 --> 00:20:06,840
Rym: I mean, it takes time to do just about anything, so that's not really a good argument.

341
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,849
Rym: That's like saying, "Hey, I'm gonna make a cure for

342
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:09,291
Rym: cancer.".

343
00:20:09,552 --> 00:20:10,216
Rym: Man, fuck that.

344
00:20:10,256 --> 00:20:11,160
Rym: That'll take time.

345
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,348
Scott: Yeah, I mean, what are we gonna do until then?

346
00:20:14,369 --> 00:20:17,740
Scott: We're gonna have to keep using these current cures for cancer.

347
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,834
Scott: Or we're gonna use your experimental thing you're working on?

348
00:20:20,915 --> 00:20:22,060
Scott: It's like, no, you just keep--.

349
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:31,160
Rym: Actually, I'm not gonna get into this a lot, but there's a logical fallacy around that idea that I've seen a lot on the internet lately, and it's starting to tick me off.

350
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,540
Rym: So, I think next Thursday, we're gonna do a show on all the logical fallacies and how you can avoid them.

351
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,163
Scott: That's a good one.

352
00:20:36,183 --> 00:20:37,008
Rym: Or use them to your advantage.

353
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:37,772
Rym: With that German book.

354
00:20:38,415 --> 00:20:39,320
Rym: Yeah, that German book!

355
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:39,860
Scott: Yeah.

356
00:20:40,140 --> 00:21:01,060
Scott: Alright, so anyway, the point is, if you're a Linux user or thinking about becoming one, in the near future, probably like the next release or two of Ubuntu, you'll start seeing the kind of things like unplugging and replugging into different networks, just switching your network with the cable, and going on and off of different wireless networks.

357
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:10,500
Scott: Like, if you walk around somewhere and there's a bunch of wireless networks, it'll start getting really easy just to switch networks all the time with laptops and stuff, as soon as they figure this stuff out.

358
00:21:11,921 --> 00:21:16,940
Scott: And all these nerds who think that we shouldn't implement this feature and make life easier can shove it.

359
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:21,878
Rym: Well, this is like that nerd way back when you were talking about with Gentoo, how, "Why isn't there a nice GUI

360
00:21:21,898 --> 00:21:22,399
Rym: installer?".

361
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,724
Scott: And he said, "Don't make a GUI

362
00:21:23,764 --> 00:21:24,265
Scott: installer!".

363
00:21:24,285 --> 00:21:24,727
Scott: I'm like, "Why?

364
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:25,890
Scott: No one's making you use it.

365
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,538
Scott: They're still gonna have the old, busted installer for

366
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:28,699
Scott: you.".

367
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,032
Scott: And he's like, "But those people working on it could be working on something

368
00:21:32,072 --> 00:21:32,212
Scott: else.".

369
00:21:32,253 --> 00:21:34,020
Scott: And I'm like, "Well, first of all, what are you working

370
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,120
Scott: on?".

371
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,499
Scott: And two, "No, they couldn't be working on something else, 'cause they're only gonna work on what they want

372
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:38,620
Scott: to.".

373
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:45,080
Rym: See, that's another, actually, that's another very similar logical fallacy that I've also seen a lot on the internet, particularly on FARC.

374
00:21:45,566 --> 00:21:45,819
Rym: Yeah.

375
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,145
Rym: Where someone will say, like, "Scientists discover

376
00:21:48,165 --> 00:21:48,506
Rym: something.".

377
00:21:49,028 --> 00:21:51,354
Rym: And people will say, "That was a waste of time.

378
00:21:51,554 --> 00:21:53,098
Rym: They could've been working on this problem

379
00:21:53,138 --> 00:21:53,479
Rym: instead.".

380
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,330
Scott: Why, why is Stephen Hawking worrying about black holes that don't bother us?

381
00:21:57,571 --> 00:21:59,376
Scott: He could be working on the cure for AIDS.

382
00:21:59,577 --> 00:22:00,740
Scott: No, he doesn't know shit about the cure for AIDS.

383
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,831
Rym: Rym and Scott, why are you working on a podcast?

384
00:22:02,891 --> 00:22:04,460
Rym: You could be giving food to homeless people.

385
00:22:05,181 --> 00:22:06,104
Scott: Yeah, right.

386
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:07,711
Scott: Okay.

387
00:22:08,173 --> 00:22:09,740
Scott: So, I think that's enough of that.

388
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:28,380
Rym: So, my, uh, thing of the day, it's real short, real quick, but basically I found this cool site where some guy and his wife, every year since 1976, on a specific day, June 17th, take a picture of themselves and everyone in their family.

389
00:22:28,762 --> 00:22:32,960
Rym: So, now they have this cool time-lapse progression of their families or the ages.

390
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,438
Scott: That's pretty cool.

391
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,430
Rym: Yeah, I don't have much else to say about that.

392
00:22:37,014 --> 00:22:37,839
Rym: I think it's a neat idea.

393
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,493
Scott: I wish, uh, maybe I'll start doing something like that.

394
00:22:41,634 --> 00:22:42,800
Scott: You want to start doing it tomorrow?

395
00:22:43,223 --> 00:22:43,560
Rym: We could.

396
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:44,615
Rym: Yeah, well.

397
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:51,300
Rym: It reminds me a lot of, on FARC every now and then, people linked to this old one about, there was this woman who was a meth addict.

398
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:52,228
Rym: Whoa.

399
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,559
Rym: And every time she got arrested, they took a picture of her.

400
00:22:54,903 --> 00:22:55,398
Rym: Oh, I saw that.

401
00:22:55,781 --> 00:23:04,140
Rym: Someone found all these pictures of the same woman, and they made this animation of through the years, and it'll scare anyone in the world away from taking crystal meth.

402
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,178
Scott: That's for sure.

403
00:23:06,641 --> 00:23:08,879
Scott: It gets really scary when she has like no teeth and shit.

404
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,340
Rym: Yeah, meth mouth.

405
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:11,166
Scott: Ugh.

406
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,803
Rym: Man, freaking meth heads.

407
00:23:12,904 --> 00:23:17,360
Rym: I don't care that you're destroying your brain, and that you're screwing yourself up, and dangerous chemicals, whatever.

408
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,300
Rym: But because of you, I have to sign a form to get my freaking Sudafed.

409
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:25,900
Scott: Yeah, I don't take Sudafed, but Nyquil is now harder to get too, so.

410
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,640
Rym: Yeah, we stocked up on the old Nyquil because of you bastards.

411
00:23:28,902 --> 00:23:29,239
Scott: Yeah, did we?

412
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,020
Rym: Yeah, I got two big jars of the old Nyquil.

413
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:37,120
Scott: Yeah, now, okay, so we bought two big things of the old Nyquil, now they think that we're meth machine makers.

414
00:23:38,002 --> 00:23:39,560
Scott: Do you think we got a meth lab going?

415
00:23:41,124 --> 00:23:41,800
Scott: Alright, anyway.

416
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,520
Rym: Dude, don't tell them about our meth lab.

417
00:23:45,548 --> 00:23:47,460
Scott: Uh, we don't make meth here.

418
00:23:49,505 --> 00:23:50,539
Scott: Uh, please stay away.

419
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:51,077
Scott: Yeah.

420
00:23:53,248 --> 00:23:53,956
Scott: We won't let you in.

421
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:54,260
Scott: Okay.

422
00:23:55,180 --> 00:24:08,060
Scott: So, I'm from the Northeast United States, and, you know, nowadays we have Best Buy and Circuit City and whatnot, but back in the day we had stores like The Wiz, and, you know, I guess some others, but...

423
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,860
Rym: Yeah, where I lived we had ABC Warehouse.

424
00:24:10,426 --> 00:24:10,512
Scott: Yeah.

425
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,879
Rym: And Ernest P. Worrell was the advertising spokesman for them.

426
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:14,883
Scott: Oh, okay.

427
00:24:15,586 --> 00:24:18,140
Scott: Oh, wait, Ernest, as in like Ernest something something?

428
00:24:18,444 --> 00:24:18,698
Rym: Yes.

429
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:19,204
Scott: Wow.

430
00:24:20,163 --> 00:24:24,320
Scott: Alright, so, we had one store called Crazy Eddies.

431
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:35,340
Scott: Now, Crazy Eddies was, they didn't have one near me until like just when, I would always see the commercials on TV for Crazy Eddies.

432
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:39,997
Scott: Like, you would see like one during every show, you know, on any channel.

433
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:40,800
Scott: Just guaranteed.

434
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:46,180
Scott: But we never actually went to that store until they opened one up like right next to our house.

435
00:24:46,383 --> 00:24:46,633
Scott: Uh huh.

436
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,995
Scott: I remember when I went there, it was like, it was really crazy, like they gave everyone this yellow t-shirt.

437
00:24:51,035 --> 00:24:52,300
Scott: I wonder if we still have it somewhere.

438
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,092
Scott: There's a picture of the t-shirt online, you can see it.

439
00:24:55,876 --> 00:24:56,500
Scott: It's one of the links.

440
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,955
Scott: And, like, they gave out all this free shit, and it was really pretty crazy.

441
00:25:02,316 --> 00:25:03,500
Scott: You know, they went along with the theme.

442
00:25:04,641 --> 00:25:10,572
Scott: And, you know, Crazy Eddies wasn't really special, but the commercials were kind of crazy.

443
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,976
Scott: They had this guy, the guy wasn't Crazy Eddy.

444
00:25:13,076 --> 00:25:15,040
Scott: Crazy Eddy was some like Jew from Brooklyn.

445
00:25:16,642 --> 00:25:22,000
Scott: Uh, the commercials, though, were this other guy, I don't know his name, but it's on the website somewhere.

446
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:33,860
Scott: And he would be like, you know, "Crazy Eddy, blah blah blah blah blah blah, our prices are so low, we got this and this and this and this, oh my god, it's the summer, we got air conditioners and fans, air conditioners and fans, oh my god, oh my

447
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,000
Scott: god.".

448
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:37,355
Scott: And then at the end of every commercial, he would say, "And the prices are

449
00:25:37,455 --> 00:25:38,460
Scott: insane.".

450
00:25:39,141 --> 00:25:45,336
Rym: I mean, you might have seen a lot of spoofs of this kind of ad in recent years, or even, you know, ten years ago, whatever, they're all over the place.

451
00:25:45,737 --> 00:25:46,960
Rym: This guy was one of the originals.

452
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,845
Scott: Yeah, this guy is like the real deal.

453
00:25:48,905 --> 00:25:53,340
Scott: I mean, they even did jokes about this guy and like Futurama and shit.

454
00:25:54,861 --> 00:26:07,500
Scott: So, by happenstance, on the internet today, I came across, you know, like the official Crazy Eddy, like, tribute site, and on YouTube, I found a bunch of videos of Crazy Eddy commercials from back in the day.

455
00:26:08,281 --> 00:26:09,243
Scott: And they're pretty hilarious.

456
00:26:09,904 --> 00:26:12,889
Scott: Now, the final story of Crazy Eddy is that he had two stores.

457
00:26:12,929 --> 00:26:19,800
Scott: There was Crazy Eddy's, which is an appliance store like Best Buy, and there was Crazy Eddy's Record and Tape Asylum.

458
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:20,501
Scott: You get it?

459
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:26,636
Scott: Crazy Eddy's, Price is Insane, Record and Tape Asylum, where he would sell records and tapes.

460
00:26:26,697 --> 00:26:28,080
Scott: It was like a music store.

461
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:28,957
Rym: I think we all get it.

462
00:26:29,661 --> 00:26:34,911
Scott: And, um, in the end, Crazy Eddy went to, he was a criminal.

463
00:26:35,192 --> 00:26:39,280
Scott: He basically cooked the books, and he cheated on taxes, and he cheated on inventory.

464
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,539
Rym: Good deal!

465
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,688
Scott: It was like far more times ten, except, you know, whatever.

466
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:49,980
Scott: He ran away to Israel, but then they extradited him, and he changed, you know, he got mad busted.

467
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,222
Scott: He's in jail.

468
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:56,733
Scott: I think he had to pay $150 million in criminal fines, and then, like, a billion dollars in civil suits.

469
00:27:01,226 --> 00:27:01,519
Scott: Aha!

470
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,688
Scott: Yeah, he got totally pooned.

471
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,120
Scott: If it was Detter's Prison, he would just kill himself.

472
00:27:08,482 --> 00:27:15,800
Scott: But there is one thing I noticed in the commercial, in one of the commercials I watched, for the Record and Tape Asylum, that I want to talk about for a little bit.

473
00:27:16,481 --> 00:27:18,243
Scott: The prices on his records and tapes.

474
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:29,820
Scott: He was selling, now this is Crazy Eddy's, so the prices are a little low, you know, but the, uh, the records and tapes were selling for, like, six, seven bucks a record.

475
00:27:30,264 --> 00:27:31,158
Rym: Now, what year was this?

476
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,838
Scott: Nineteen, late eighties.

477
00:27:34,488 --> 00:27:35,339
Scott: Mid to late eighties.

478
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,259
Rym: So inflation does definitely not account for all of that.

479
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:44,800
Scott: Mid to late eighties, entire albums were selling for in between five and ten dollars.

480
00:27:45,482 --> 00:27:50,720
Scott: And this is at Crazy Eddy's, so you can add a buck or two to get to the, you know, what other stores are selling it for.

481
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,099
Rym: Now, what do CDs sell for nowadays?

482
00:27:52,860 --> 00:28:02,580
Scott: More than fifteen dollars for, like, brand new, amazing hot ones that are pop whatevers, and between ten and fifteen for your average ones, I guess.

483
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,324
Scott: And they're selling a dollar a song on iTunes.

484
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:12,960
Scott: A dollar a song on iTunes is a shittier deal than what you would get at a normal record store for a vinyl in the mid to late eighties.

485
00:28:13,583 --> 00:28:16,900
Rym: Uh, actually, I'll bet if you count inflation, they're probably about the same.

486
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,880
Scott: Maybe, let's see, a dollar a song if an album has fifteen songs.

487
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,590
Rym: An album has fifteen songs on it?

488
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,113
Rym: Are you kidding?

489
00:28:23,173 --> 00:28:24,099
Rym: Most albums have six.

490
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:25,441
Scott: Six?

491
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:27,305
Scott: Holy shit.

492
00:28:27,986 --> 00:28:30,872
Scott: But these were vinyl records that you were buying in the mid to late eighties.

493
00:28:30,892 --> 00:28:34,880
Scott: They had an A side and a B side with, like, six songs per side.

494
00:28:35,201 --> 00:28:35,459
Rym: No, no.

495
00:28:35,501 --> 00:28:35,999
Scott: At the minimum.

496
00:28:36,421 --> 00:28:38,880
Rym: The average album nowadays has six or seven songs on it.

497
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,046
Scott: Alright, nowadays, I'm talking in the mid to late eighties.

498
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,674
Scott: So, in the mid to late eighties, you were getting more songs for your money.

499
00:28:44,536 --> 00:28:45,398
Scott: More songs for your money.

500
00:28:45,438 --> 00:28:45,960
Scott: What the hell?

501
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,932
Scott: They're wondering where, alright, here's the proof.

502
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:49,020
Scott: Right there, black and white.

503
00:28:50,101 --> 00:28:51,751
Scott: You were getting an A side and a B side.

504
00:28:51,811 --> 00:28:53,220
Scott: Nowadays, you just get an A side?

505
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,419
Rym: Actually, that commercial was in color.

506
00:28:55,043 --> 00:28:55,256
Scott: Yeah?

507
00:28:56,385 --> 00:28:56,900
Rym: Black and white.

508
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,280
Scott: What are you talking about, black and white?

509
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,151
Rym: You said there's the proof in black and white.

510
00:29:00,312 --> 00:29:01,640
Rym: It's not black and white, it's in color.

511
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,658
Scott: Alright, you can shut up.

512
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:03,986
Rym: Hey, it wasn't me.

513
00:29:04,027 --> 00:29:05,660
Rym: You're the one who made the false claim here.

514
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:06,742
Scott: Whatever.

515
00:29:07,424 --> 00:29:12,140
Scott: There used to be two sides to a record and they were cheap and, god damn it, the record companies are dumb.

516
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,095
Scott: They jacked up their prices and people stopped buying.

517
00:29:15,115 --> 00:29:15,659
Scott: and they wonder why.

518
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:18,540
Rym: Well, people didn't stop buying until they could get it for free.

519
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:30,968
Scott: Yeah, but seriously, if you want me to, if they were charging six bucks for an entire album of DRM-free, CD-quality music, and there were- CD-quality?

520
00:29:31,131 --> 00:29:31,638
Rym: Hardly.

521
00:29:32,662 --> 00:29:34,840
Scott: And, well, CD, you know, perfect CD-quality.

522
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,239
Rym: These weren't CDs.

523
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,860
Scott: Oh, you meant the vinyls weren't CD-quality.

524
00:29:39,921 --> 00:29:40,606
Scott: Oh, well that's true.

525
00:29:40,707 --> 00:29:42,300
Scott: But even vinyl quality's alright.

526
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:43,539
Rym: Eh, not really.

527
00:29:43,821 --> 00:29:45,720
Scott: He was also selling tapes, tape, you know.

528
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,579
Rym: Tapes were worse.

529
00:29:47,061 --> 00:29:48,400
Scott: Well, professional tapes are okay.

530
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,237
Rym: No, even professional tapes, because you can only master a tape.

531
00:29:51,277 --> 00:29:51,720
Rym: so far.

532
00:29:52,501 --> 00:30:01,060
Scott: Yeah, but even still, if they're selling that many songs for that few dollars, I might even buy some occasionally.

533
00:30:01,561 --> 00:30:03,198
Scott: A few, maybe two or three a year.

534
00:30:03,686 --> 00:30:03,916
Rym: Uh-huh.

535
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,046
Scott: As opposed to zero.

536
00:30:05,066 --> 00:30:06,615
Scott: So, yeah.

537
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,520
Rym: Wow, you talked for about seven minutes on your thing of the day.

538
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:16,818
Scott: Well, I had to tell the whole story of Crazy Eddie or else there would be absolutely no context to it and everyone would go, "What the fuck is

539
00:30:16,838 --> 00:30:16,998
Scott: this?".

540
00:30:17,701 --> 00:30:18,103
Rym: Eh, maybe.

541
00:30:18,123 --> 00:30:21,480
Rym: I like how mine at least is fairly self-explanatory this time.

542
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,360
Scott: Yeah, I'll get a better self-explanatory one next week.

543
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,319
Rym: Well, I didn't do that chess game thing I was gonna do.

544
00:30:27,561 --> 00:30:29,199
Scott: And I didn't do that other video I saw.

545
00:30:29,721 --> 00:30:30,136
Rym: Which one?

546
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,300
Scott: Uh, I'm gonna keep that a secret.

547
00:30:34,052 --> 00:30:34,900
Rym: Oh, that one, okay.

548
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,510
Rym: So anyway, today, we couldn't come up with much to talk about.

549
00:30:40,554 --> 00:30:41,737
Rym: And at least I'm not sick anymore.

550
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:42,520
Rym: At least not that sick.

551
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,500
Rym: So we decided, since we both commute every day by car.

552
00:30:47,022 --> 00:30:48,179
Scott: No longer taking the train.

553
00:30:48,621 --> 00:30:50,900
Rym: And it's Thursday, so we can talk about whatever we want.

554
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,078
Scott: We're gonna bring back our old segment, "How Not to

555
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:54,320
Scott: Suck.".

556
00:30:55,161 --> 00:31:04,740
Rym: Now, we're not gonna talk about speeding or the whole relationship between cops extorting people for money with speeding tickets to pay small towns to pay their salaries.

557
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:11,680
Scott: Yeah, because I think we said we were planning on talking about that before, and we will talk about that in the future, but we actually expanded our plans for that.

558
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:15,420
Rym: Yeah, and we're not gonna talk about all our crazy ideas about driving and speeding.

559
00:31:15,801 --> 00:31:23,220
Scott: This is advice to you on how not to suck at driving, because a lot of people suck at driving and they can't drive for shit.

560
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:33,660
Scott: And there are things you can do other than, you know, improving your hand-eye coordination and such to be a better driver and not fuck up the road and not get in my way.

561
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:44,200
Rym: Now, of course, I guess what we could start with is we can just go through a lot of the little things that people probably don't realize they're doing or don't realize are bad and talk about them.

562
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,645
Scott: Well, let's start simple.

563
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,080
Scott: Always use your signal lights.

564
00:31:49,461 --> 00:31:52,475
Rym: Yeah, seriously, if you're turning, turn on your turn signal.

565
00:31:52,796 --> 00:31:53,540
Rym: It's not that hard.

566
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:04,980
Scott: If you're merging into a lane or changing lanes, turn your signal on, then start to think about, you know, it's like decide you're gonna change the lane, turn the signal on, then wait for the opening and go.

567
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:17,560
Rym: I mean, I see people who they use their signals, and I'm making little quote-y marks with my fingers, because if I use my signal, I mean they'll start merging into the lane, turn on the signal for a second, and then turn it off and finish merging.

568
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:26,497
Scott: Yeah, the idea is you want to tell the guy behind you and the people to the back and the sides that, hey, I'm coming this way, watch out, and then you come that way.

569
00:32:26,557 --> 00:32:27,840
Scott: You don't start going and then signal.

570
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,748
Scott: The other thing is, on the way to work, here's a good example.

571
00:32:31,768 --> 00:32:34,153
Scott: There's a road, Route 121, alright?

572
00:32:34,734 --> 00:32:37,120
Scott: And it kind of makes his left turn at some point.

573
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,700
Scott: And coming off the elbow of the turn is route something else, right?

574
00:32:43,281 --> 00:32:50,194
Scott: Now, basically, you're either going, it's a fork in the road, essentially, but to the left fork, you're not actually changing roads.

575
00:32:50,875 --> 00:32:53,380
Scott: If you're not changing roads, you don't need to signal left.

576
00:32:54,641 --> 00:33:00,100
Scott: You're staying on the same road, you're not stopping at a stoplight sign or a light and turning, you just keep going straight.

577
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,505
Rym: I guess that's not so bad.

578
00:33:01,565 --> 00:33:04,980
Rym: I'd rather someone signal when they don't have to than not signal when they should.

579
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,282
Scott: It is not so bad.

580
00:33:06,322 --> 00:33:17,138
Scott: It is much more important to always signal when required to, but at the same time, signaling when not required, well, doesn't have really negative consequences.

581
00:33:17,198 --> 00:33:18,240
Scott: It's not perfect driving.

582
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,104
Rym: See, I don't even care about that.

583
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,948
Rym: I'm looking for, use your signals.

584
00:33:22,048 --> 00:33:26,560
Rym: I don't care if you use your signal when you shouldn't, unless you have your signal on and you don't intend to turn.

585
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,702
Scott: Oh, God, yeah.

586
00:33:28,782 --> 00:33:43,460
Scott: If your signal doesn't automatically turn off, you know, because usually if you spin the wheel a lot, like you're taking a right turn, and you have a right signal, and you let go of the wheel and it rotates back to going straight, the signal will un-pop, you know, and stop blinking.

587
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:52,696
Scott: But sometimes, if you make like a little turn or a little lane change, it doesn't stop on its own, and in that case, un-freaking-click it.

588
00:33:53,778 --> 00:33:54,960
Scott: Like, don't leave it on.

589
00:33:55,280 --> 00:34:16,280
Rym: Now, if you're wondering, like, why should you care about that specific thing, it varies from state to state, but in most states, if you have your turn signal on, and there's an intersection coming up, or anywhere you could have turned your car to, and you keep going straight, and someone pulls out in front of you and you hit them, it's 100% your fault and you'll get the ticket, because you were signaling that you were going to turn.

590
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,341
Scott: Yeah, here's an example.

591
00:34:17,481 --> 00:34:20,985
Scott: I was, there's a road, think of a T in the road, right?

592
00:34:21,205 --> 00:34:33,138
Scott: And I'm on the vertical part of the T, so there are cars going across the top of the T in both directions, and I'm trying to get onto the top of the T. I'm trying to turn left onto it, right?

593
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:34,540
Scott: And go off the left side.

594
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:38,483
Scott: A guy is coming across the T from the left to the right.

595
00:34:38,603 --> 00:34:41,606
Scott: He's going to pass in front of me if he continues to go straight.

596
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,449
Scott: He has his signal on that says he is turning right.

597
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:49,774
Scott: I safely assume he's going to turn right and thus not go in front of me.

598
00:34:49,853 --> 00:34:58,925
Scott: He's going to go down to the bottom of the T, which means it's free for me to turn left onto the T. He, in fact, does not turn right and continues to go straight.

599
00:34:58,966 --> 00:35:00,749
Scott: He just had his signal on like an asshole.

600
00:35:02,193 --> 00:35:05,540
Scott: If he did that, he would just slam right into the side of me when I came out.

601
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,360
Rym: And it would be 100% his fault, and he would get a ticket, and you could call the police.

602
00:35:10,003 --> 00:35:10,340
Rym: Mm-hmm.

603
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,079
Rym: Now, the problem with this is that if you're the only one in your car, and he's the only one in his car...

604
00:35:15,522 --> 00:35:16,398
Scott: You don't have enough witnesses.

605
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,362
Rym: You need a witness.

606
00:35:17,963 --> 00:35:26,300
Rym: Bear in mind that even if someone does something stupid, but it's like, say you see the guy has his turn signal on, but he's going 80 and he's obviously not slowing down.

607
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,063
Scott: Yeah, don't pull out in front of him.

608
00:35:28,323 --> 00:35:34,577
Rym: I mean, you're technically in the right, but when you involve yourself with a stupid person, you cannot benefit from it.

609
00:35:34,657 --> 00:35:36,000
Rym: It can only hurt both of you.

610
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:42,760
Scott: Whenever I see someone coming with the signal on like that, I always wait for them to slow down before I come out.

611
00:35:43,102 --> 00:35:46,420
Scott: Because at least if they slow down, I can step on it and get out of the way.

612
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,284
Rym: See, at least you're more forgiving in that sense.

613
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:54,540
Rym: If I ignore signals completely, if I see what someone's signal on, I assume that they're not going to follow it.

614
00:35:54,721 --> 00:35:58,220
Rym: And if I don't see a signal, I assume that they could turn in any direction at any time.

615
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,651
Scott: No, if I don't see a signal, I assume they're going to go in any direction at any time.

616
00:36:02,832 --> 00:36:05,820
Scott: And I kind of watch the movements of their car to try to guess where they're going to go.

617
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,520
Rym: Yeah, you can usually tell pretty well, because a lot of people swing out before they turn or other bad things they'll get into.

618
00:36:11,861 --> 00:36:12,484
Scott: Yeah, alright.

619
00:36:13,267 --> 00:36:15,495
Scott: Here, I know what we could talk about for like ten minutes.

620
00:36:15,576 --> 00:36:15,877
Scott: Right-of-way.

621
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,111
Rym: Alright, how do we start?

622
00:36:19,131 --> 00:36:20,560
Rym: We could start with a four-way stop.

623
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,469
Scott: Well, let's start with talking about what right-of-way is.

624
00:36:22,711 --> 00:36:24,339
Scott: People don't understand right-of-way.

625
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:32,439
Scott: The right-of-way is when one or more cars wants to occupy the same spot on the road, you have to take turns.

626
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,780
Scott: Whoever has the right-of-way gets to occupy that space first.

627
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,660
Rym: Now, airplanes and boats have the same thing, but the rules are different.

628
00:36:39,922 --> 00:36:42,056
Scott: And we don't even know the rules for boats, 100% of the rules.

629
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,358
Rym: I know I'm a little, because I grew up on the lakes, but...

630
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,620
Scott: Yeah, big boats have right-of-way.

631
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,740
Rym: Well, basically that's just because, yeah, they can't stop.

632
00:36:48,024 --> 00:36:48,111
Scott: Yeah.

633
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,633
Rym: But on the road, now, you might think, alright, so if I have right-of-way, I can go.

634
00:36:53,774 --> 00:36:55,980
Rym: And if I don't have right-of-way, I have to let the other person go.

635
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:56,344
Rym: Mmm.

636
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,061
Rym: No.

637
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:59,490
Rym: If you don't have right-of-way, you can't go.

638
00:36:59,831 --> 00:37:02,100
Rym: But if you have right-of-way, you must go.

639
00:37:02,641 --> 00:37:03,579
Scott: You must go.

640
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:11,180
Rym: If you give up your right-of-way to let someone else go, not only are you breaking the traffic pattern, but in many places you're breaking the law.

641
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:23,477
Scott: Yeah, and not only that, but breaking the traffic pattern, you might think you're real nice, like, "Oh, I'll stop in the middle of the road to let this guy out, because there's no way he can get out, you know, because there's so many cars.

642
00:37:23,717 --> 00:37:25,019
Scott: I'll be nice and I'll wave him

643
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:25,240
Scott: out.".

644
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:31,580
Scott: You're actually fucking up the traffic royally and making a much more dangerous situation, no matter how nice you think you are.

645
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:37,440
Rym: Not only that, if he gets into an accident because you let him in that way, you're at fault no matter what he did.

646
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:48,116
Scott: Yeah, if you wave someone, never wave anybody, ever, for any reason, if you wave someone, if someone waves me, I go, no matter what.

647
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:50,760
Scott: Because if something happens to me, they're at fault.

648
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,720
Rym: See, I don't do that, because I'd rather not get hit, and I'd rather let some other stupid person.

649
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,288
Scott: Oh, well, I obviously don't do it.

650
00:37:56,329 --> 00:37:58,400
Scott: if there's obviously a dangerous situation.

651
00:37:58,601 --> 00:38:01,936
Scott: Sometimes I'll stop and I'll sit there and be like, "No, I'm not going.

652
00:38:02,097 --> 00:38:02,418
Scott: You keep

653
00:38:02,458 --> 00:38:02,780
Scott: waving.".

654
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:06,660
Rym: It would surprise you how many times I run into people on the road who just don't understand this.

655
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:13,200
Rym: Like, I used to have a long commute through all these different backroad, like, county route whatevers, up to Poughkeepsie, from where I worked at IBM.

656
00:38:14,321 --> 00:38:22,320
Rym: And there was one part where I took this little shortcut through a tiny subdivision, and then there's a freeway, a 55 mile an hour highway, and I have to turn left onto it.

657
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,283
Rym: It's a little two-lane thing.

658
00:38:23,985 --> 00:38:24,828
Rym: There's just a stop sign.

659
00:38:24,848 --> 00:38:28,278
Rym: So basically, I had to sit there for like five minutes and then fight my way on.

660
00:38:28,398 --> 00:38:28,900
Rym: That's fine.

661
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:40,300
Rym: At least once or twice a month, I'd be sitting there, and someone going 55 toward the left or the right would slow down and stop and then wave me through like, "Hey, I'm going to let you

662
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:40,440
Rym: go.".

663
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:46,840
Rym: Meanwhile, traffic's now backing up behind them, people are going into the shoulder trying to get around them, no one knows what's going on.

664
00:38:47,161 --> 00:38:51,900
Rym: They're honking at me, getting mad because I'm not taking advantage of their stupid kindness and going.

665
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:57,877
Scott: Yeah, because they tried to be nice to Rym, they screwed 30 people behind them in traffic.

666
00:38:58,579 --> 00:38:58,740
Rym: Good job.

667
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:03,079
Rym: So I guess the moral here is, if you have the right of way, you are obligated to take it.

668
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:12,360
Rym: And if someone has the right of way, and they defer it to you, unless you're sure that nothing's going to happen, like it's the only other car on the road, don't go.

669
00:39:12,681 --> 00:39:17,460
Rym: Just sit there, and if they get mad at you, tough, because this is their problem, let them figure it out.

670
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:23,260
Scott: Yeah, and I'm not going to bother going over what right of way is in every possible situation.

671
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:30,860
Scott: Go to like the DMV website for your state or something and find the rules about right of way, and just read the list and memorize it.

672
00:39:31,181 --> 00:39:33,660
Scott: It'll surprise you when you have right of way and when you don't.

673
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:39,740
Rym: Though very simply, like in the most summary of summary, void where prohibited may not apply in all states.

674
00:39:40,582 --> 00:39:43,771
Rym: If you're on a road, that's the most right of way you can have.

675
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:47,380
Rym: Whoever's already on a road and already moving has the most right of way.

676
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:58,960
Rym: After that, whoever is turning right, well, whoever's going straight has right of way, whoever's going right has right of way, whoever's turning left typically has the least right of way in any situation.

677
00:39:59,368 --> 00:39:59,538
Scott: Yep.

678
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,344
Rym: Typically now.

679
00:40:00,746 --> 00:40:02,880
Rym: I mean, four-way stops and all that are completely different.

680
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:03,501
Scott: Mhm.

681
00:40:03,822 --> 00:40:08,580
Scott: Four-way stops, whoever gets there goes first, but if a male truck gets there, he goes first.

682
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,510
Rym: Only if he arrives simultaneously.

683
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,360
Rym: That's kind of an apocryphal thing.

684
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:17,360
Scott: Oh yeah, but like if a fire and, oh, okay, no wait, emergency vehicles always have right of way.

685
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,279
Scott: Their lights are on.

686
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,819
Rym: Let's talk about emergency vehicles.

687
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:20,290
Rym: Yes.

688
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:25,020
Rym: Because I actually was almost involved in an accident about two years ago because of a dumb shit.

689
00:40:25,406 --> 00:40:25,680
Scott: Okay.

690
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:35,220
Rym: So I'm on a 55 road, I'm driving somewhere, and it's a two-lane road, and I'm going, and I see an ambulance coming in front of me, like down the road coming toward me.

691
00:40:35,802 --> 00:40:41,040
Rym: Now, unless a road is divided, and be worried because in some states, even if it's divided, you still have to pull over.

692
00:40:42,062 --> 00:40:45,879
Rym: I'm actually not sure if New York is that way, but- But you pull over no matter what.

693
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:53,800
Rym: Basically, if you see flashing lights on the same road you are- Or if you hear sirens and then you look in all your mirrors to look for flashing lights, you know?

694
00:40:53,820 --> 00:41:00,440
Rym: So basically, I see the ambulance coming in the opposite lane toward me, so I did the right thing, I pulled half off the road and stopped.

695
00:41:01,281 --> 00:41:10,599
Rym: Car coming up behind me sees the ambulance, because the ambulance is obviously coming, almost hits me, sits behind me, honking at me, and then starts to try to go around me.

696
00:41:11,503 --> 00:41:12,879
Rym: Just as the ambulance gets there.

697
00:41:13,164 --> 00:41:13,440
Scott: Great.

698
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:20,200
Rym: The ambulance swerves out of the way, he like freaks out, everyone barely misses each other, and then he passes me, flips me off, and keeps going.

699
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,052
Scott: Yeah, uh, you have to pull over if there's an ambulance coming.

700
00:41:24,433 --> 00:41:25,135
Scott: Or else, you know what?

701
00:41:25,236 --> 00:41:26,440
Scott: You might end up in that ambulance.

702
00:41:26,661 --> 00:41:34,260
Rym: You wouldn't believe how- I mean, it happens to me constantly, because for some reason, there's like a major ambulance throughfare on the road I take to the freeway to work every day.

703
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,512
Scott: Yeah, I think there's a hospital right there, actually.

704
00:41:36,532 --> 00:41:37,720
Scott: There was one on the way home today.

705
00:41:38,623 --> 00:41:41,520
Rym: Well, there's also that old folks' home and that veterans' hospital right here.

706
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,001
Rym: Yeah.

707
00:41:42,844 --> 00:41:45,635
Scott: An ambulance came by on the way home today, I saw it, came up behind me.

708
00:41:45,876 --> 00:41:46,760
Scott: Everyone pulled over, though.

709
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,880
Rym: So, for the love of God, pull over for emergency vehicles trying to get through.

710
00:41:51,121 --> 00:41:57,580
Scott: Yeah, and if you hear sirens, look in all your mirrors constantly until you no longer hear the sirens, because you have no idea where that can be.

711
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:04,618
Scott: Sometimes, I've been caught once or twice where I hear sirens, and I go, "Oh, that's way off back to the right, it's not near me, it's on some side

712
00:42:04,678 --> 00:42:04,879
Scott: road.".

713
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,758
Scott: "No, oh, there they are, let me pull

714
00:42:06,819 --> 00:42:06,920
Scott: over.".

715
00:42:07,601 --> 00:42:08,789
Scott: You know, you gotta keep the eye out.

716
00:42:09,292 --> 00:42:10,299
Scott: They might sneak up behind you.

717
00:42:11,941 --> 00:42:13,860
Scott: Alright, let's talk about headlights.

718
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,086
Rym: Alright, headlights are real simple.

719
00:42:16,428 --> 00:42:19,099
Rym: They light up your way, and they let other people see you.

720
00:42:19,882 --> 00:42:23,853
Scott: Even if it's not dark out, it's good to turn them on.

721
00:42:23,893 --> 00:42:26,340
Scott: It's actually, it's never wrong to have your headlights on.

722
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,869
Rym: Yes, when in doubt, turn your lights on automatically.

723
00:42:28,889 --> 00:42:31,560
Rym: It doesn't cost you anything, it doesn't slow your car down.

724
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:31,943
Rym: Yeah.

725
00:42:31,963 --> 00:42:32,879
Rym: They don't burn out.

726
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:39,920
Scott: Even if it's bright daylight in the middle of the summer on a sunny Sunday drive, having your headlights on, there's nothing wrong with that.

727
00:42:40,101 --> 00:42:41,920
Scott: In fact, I won't tell you to turn them off.

728
00:42:42,261 --> 00:42:49,300
Rym: I'll point out that in Canada, at least, all cars for a long time have been required to have daytime running lights.

729
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,080
Rym: Meaning, the lights are on, kind of dim, but they're on no matter what when the car is on.

730
00:42:54,060 --> 00:43:03,200
Rym: Now, they're starting, they're coming over to the US a lot, and I'll tell you this, Geico gave me like a hundred bucks off every two months or so, because I have daytime running lights.

731
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:08,180
Scott: Yeah, I'd like to have daytime running lights, but my car doesn't have it, and I wasn't going to change cars over that little thing.

732
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,040
Scott: But I turn them on all the time.

733
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:18,960
Rym: Now, the reason is, because in Canada, they've had this for so long, and studies have shown that cars with daytime running lights are involved in like half the accidents.

734
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,900
Rym: Because, I mean, alright, I don't want to go into this in great detail.

735
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:23,899
Scott: People can see you coming.

736
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:38,000
Rym: Well, basically, driving in normal situations, whenever there's nothing abnormal going on in the road, you know, basically clear weather, you're driving, there's no emergency vehicles, there's no accidents, there's no broken down things, no pedestrians.

737
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:40,669
Rym: Driving is fairly automatic, a robot could do it.

738
00:43:41,191 --> 00:43:43,780
Rym: There's yellow lines to your left, there's white lines to your right.

739
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:49,880
Rym: Stay between the lines, there are signals that tell you exactly when to go, how fast to go, when to stop, what to do at all times.

740
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,920
Rym: Driving is completely automatic.

741
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:00,100
Rym: And people who drive for years and years and years get good at that, like you know you've been driving on a long trip, on a freeway for hours and hours.

742
00:44:00,541 --> 00:44:02,119
Scott: And not even thinking, you're just magically going.

743
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,640
Rym: You're just kind of zoned out and going.

744
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:09,800
Scott: It's like DDR, you don't even think about the arrows after a certain point, they just, the arrows go in your eyes and come out your legs like magic.

745
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:17,996
Rym: Now there have been a lot of studies on this, and basically the more cues there are, cues, I mean, things that tell your brain what to do.

746
00:44:18,337 --> 00:44:19,540
Rym: so you don't have to know what to do.

747
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,139
Rym: Like, you know, there's the yellow line on the left and the white line on the right.

748
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:27,040
Rym: Notice how on freeways they also have the yellow reflectors and the white reflectors off the side of the road.

749
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:35,720
Rym: And all those sorts of things just add more and more cues to kind of train your brain, so even if you're not paying attention, your car is probably going to keep going the direction you want it to go.

750
00:44:36,941 --> 00:44:40,519
Rym: Red lights in the back of a car and white lights in the front of a car are part of that.

751
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:45,400
Rym: Seeing two white lights immediately cues you in, whether you're conscious of it or not, that there's a car coming.

752
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:52,280
Rym: So having two white lights in your car at all times greatly increases the visibility of your car, even on a sunny day.

753
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:57,970
Scott: Alright, so here's the rules for when you absolutely must have your lights on.

754
00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:02,840
Scott: I don't care if you have them on when the sun's out, but there are some times where if you don't have them on, I'll kill you.

755
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:08,720
Rym: And also, I'll note, at least in New York State, it is illegal to drive your car without your lights on in many of these situations.

756
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,310
Scott: Situation number one, the sky is overcast.

757
00:45:12,511 --> 00:45:15,160
Scott: If you can't see any sky, you better have those lights on.

758
00:45:16,161 --> 00:45:25,180
Scott: Number two, if there is any amount of precipitation of any variety, snow, rain, hail, sleet, I don't care what the hell it is, you better have your lights on.

759
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:26,547
Rym: That's a state law here.

760
00:45:26,607 --> 00:45:27,674
Rym: They can actually pull you over.

761
00:45:27,714 --> 00:45:28,560
Rym: It's a fairly big ticket.

762
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:30,500
Scott: I saw a guy who was pulled over for it today.

763
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:31,013
Scott: Alright.

764
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:33,820
Scott: The state law is wipers on, lights on.

765
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:37,620
Rym: So theoretically, you could not use your wipers, then you don't have to turn your lights on.

766
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:41,860
Scott: But not using your wipers in the rain will get you a ticket also, because that's reckless driving.

767
00:45:42,242 --> 00:45:46,920
Rym: No, no, reckless driving is actually if you commit multiple other traffic offenses within a certain set of time.

768
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,500
Scott: But it's still a traffic offense if you just let your windshield get obscured.

769
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,100
Rym: Well, yeah, but that's a, that, yeah, I forget what that one's called.

770
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:59,635
Scott: But seriously, if the cop sees that you just don't have your wipers on and it's raining, he'll be like, "Um, how are you driving?

771
00:45:59,655 --> 00:46:00,296
Scott: Are you okay?

772
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:01,479
Scott: What's going on

773
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:01,660
Scott: here?".

774
00:46:01,901 --> 00:46:03,219
Rym: Yeah, but turn your lights on.

775
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,406
Scott: Yeah, uh, let's see.

776
00:46:05,707 --> 00:46:07,753
Scott: If there is fog, turn your lights on.

777
00:46:07,874 --> 00:46:09,860
Scott: And if you have fog lights, turn those on too.

778
00:46:10,061 --> 00:46:12,591
Rym: Now, if there's fog, don't turn your brights on.

779
00:46:12,771 --> 00:46:13,675
Rym: That's not gonna help.

780
00:46:13,936 --> 00:46:14,960
Rym: That's gonna make you see lights.

781
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,724
Scott: Okay, I'm gonna talk, that's.

782
00:46:15,744 --> 00:46:18,660
Scott: the third thing I'm gonna talk about is different types of headlights, so we'll get to that.

783
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:30,920
Scott: Uh, if it's nighttime, as in the sun is getting close to the edge of the sky, or is, basically, it's starting to be obscured by trees and landscape.

784
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:31,911
Rym: Yeah.

785
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:32,887
Rym: That's the law here.

786
00:46:33,028 --> 00:46:34,339
Rym: At dusk, the lights have to come on.

787
00:46:34,601 --> 00:46:39,300
Scott: Yep, and if the sun isn't out yet in the morning, you also gotta have 'em on.

788
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,866
Scott: Now, the different kinds of headlights.

789
00:46:41,967 --> 00:46:45,320
Scott: A lot of people seem to be having this problem, it's just, I see it more and more every day.

790
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,833
Rym: Yeah, we keep seeing people driving around with their parking lights on.

791
00:46:47,994 --> 00:46:48,919
Rym: Or, God, alright.

792
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:54,211
Scott: Okay, so your car, whether you know it or not, has three, three light settings.

793
00:46:54,412 --> 00:46:55,314
Scott: Every single car.

794
00:46:55,414 --> 00:46:58,140
Scott: Even my piece of shit '91 Tempo had three light settings.

795
00:46:58,180 --> 00:46:58,461
Rym: At least three.

796
00:46:58,481 --> 00:47:02,501
Rym: There might be more, but these are the three that are common to every car made after, like, 1970.

797
00:47:02,501 --> 00:47:03,584
Scott: There is parking lights.

798
00:47:03,724 --> 00:47:09,600
Scott: Usually parking lights is the same dial or knob used to turn on headlights, but it's not all the way.

799
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:14,060
Scott: So it'll be, like, one, two, and one is parking light, and two is headlights.

800
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:18,160
Rym: Now, that doesn't turn on your headlights, that turns on all those, like, yellow lights around the edges of your car.

801
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:24,240
Scott: Yeah, turning on the parking lights will turn on all the lights on the inside of your car, so you can see the dashboard.

802
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:25,021
Rym: What?

803
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:26,272
Rym: Oh, yeah, well, it depends on the car.

804
00:47:26,312 --> 00:47:27,119
Rym: Not all cars do that.

805
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:32,313
Scott: Oh, most cars do it, but it'll turn on the yellow lights on the corners of your car, just stay on.

806
00:47:32,634 --> 00:47:34,920
Scott: It'll turn on, like, the red lights in the back of your car.

807
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,080
Scott: Parking lights are for when you're in a parking lot.

808
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:42,915
Rym: And they're only there so you can see without blinding pedestrians in the parking lot.

809
00:47:43,116 --> 00:47:44,280
Rym: That is their only purpose.

810
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:51,099
Scott: Yep, the only purpose of parking lights is if you're driving slowly, parking lights.

811
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:51,882
Rym: Parking lights.

812
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:52,767
Rym: They're called parking lights.

813
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:53,371
Rym: You park with them.

814
00:47:53,431 --> 00:47:54,880
Rym: Parking, parking, parking, oh my God.

815
00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:02,738
Scott: So that if you're driving around a parking lot really slow, you can see, and people can see you, but no one goes, "Ah, headlights, my

816
00:48:02,978 --> 00:48:03,139
Scott: eyes!".

817
00:48:03,802 --> 00:48:05,679
Scott: Usually use it when evacuating hockey games.

818
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:12,800
Rym: Now, a lot of people seem to think that these are dusk lights, like, it's not so dark, I'll turn on these other headlights that I have.

819
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:15,160
Scott: No, you turn the headlights on, goddammit.

820
00:48:15,241 --> 00:48:17,315
Rym: Yeah, or they'll say, "Oh, it's raining, I'll turn on the parking

821
00:48:17,355 --> 00:48:17,617
Rym: lights.".

822
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,700
Scott: Well, they don't even, I don't even know if they think they're parking lights.

823
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:20,480
Scott: I don't know what they think they are.

824
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,619
Scott: I think they're, like, half headlights, or headlights setting one, as opposed to...

825
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:25,162
Rym: They're nothing.

826
00:48:25,242 --> 00:48:26,327
Rym: They don't count as anything.

827
00:48:26,407 --> 00:48:29,220
Rym: If you're driving at night with those things on and you get pulled over, that's a ticket.

828
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:34,040
Scott: Having parking lights on is essentially having nothing on, unless you're in a parking lot, and you don't...

829
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:39,640
Rym: They're also, they're good emergency lights if, like, say your headlights stop working and you have to get to the mechanic or something.

830
00:48:40,321 --> 00:48:42,359
Rym: If you don't have any other lights, turn those on at least.

831
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,880
Scott: Yeah, 'cause then people see something.

832
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:51,160
Rym: But if you use those for any actual purpose other than parking, you're breaking the law in most states, for one, and two, you're a dumbass.

833
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:51,573
Scott: Yeah.

834
00:48:52,061 --> 00:48:55,620
Rym: This is turning into a rant, but we really hate people who can't drive.

835
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:57,087
Rym: Unless you don't have a reason to drive.

836
00:48:57,107 --> 00:48:58,676
Rym: Like, if you live in the city, or, you know...

837
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:04,940
Scott: Oh, no, I hate people who do drive, as in they are driving and they are not doing a good job of it.

838
00:49:05,144 --> 00:49:05,316
Rym: Yes.

839
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:08,135
Scott: If you don't drive at all, then I don't care if you're terrible at it.

840
00:49:08,155 --> 00:49:08,900
Scott: That doesn't matter to me.

841
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:12,360
Scott: But if you're terrible at it and you get behind the wheel, I'm coming to get you.

842
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:16,140
Rym: No, terrible as in I'm learning how to drive or I haven't driven in ten years.

843
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:20,420
Scott: Yeah, but then you'll be in a driver's ed car, or you'll have someone next to you showing you what to do.

844
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,332
Rym: Yeah, like, say you're not driving perfectly.

845
00:49:22,393 --> 00:49:23,480
Rym: You're not a great driver.

846
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:24,082
Rym: Fine.

847
00:49:24,344 --> 00:49:26,380
Rym: As long as you follow all the rules, I'm okay with you.

848
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:34,900
Scott: Oh, yeah, the things that aren't like, let's say, you know, if you can't make it between all the cones and do a nice four-wheel drift and go on a racetrack, that's fine.

849
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:37,648
Scott: As long as you, you know, obey right of way.

850
00:49:37,668 --> 00:49:39,514
Scott: It doesn't take skill to obey right of way.

851
00:49:39,534 --> 00:49:41,240
Scott: It just takes knowledge and caring.

852
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:44,260
Rym: Yeah, because honestly, driving, being good at driving, only comes with time.

853
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:49,940
Rym: I mean, when I first got my license, I wasn't that great a driver, and over the years, I got better and better just because I did it so much.

854
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:58,419
Scott: Well, I wasn't a great a driver when I was born, but by the time I got my license, I was an awesome driver because a lot of video game racing made me...

855
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,520
Rym: Yeah, because that's so realistic.

856
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,231
Scott: Well, actually, I played a whole lot of racing simulators in my younger days.

857
00:50:04,452 --> 00:50:06,318
Scott: Like, I could tell some stories.

858
00:50:06,479 --> 00:50:06,760
Scott: Anyway...

859
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,217
Rym: All we're saying here is that we're not saying you all have to be, like, awesome drivers.

860
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:11,800
Rym: That's a whole other...

861
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,654
Scott: If you're not Michael Schumacher, that's okay.

862
00:50:13,775 --> 00:50:14,360
Scott: I'm not either.

863
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,379
Rym: As long as you follow the rules, I'm okay with you.

864
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:16,701
Rym: Yep.

865
00:50:17,304 --> 00:50:18,088
Scott: Alright.

866
00:50:18,189 --> 00:50:20,300
Scott: The third headlight setting is your brights.

867
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:29,280
Scott: You might not know this, but the brights on some cars are actually separate bulbs, but really what they are is they shine the headlights at a different angle, a wider angle.

868
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,151
Rym: Yeah, they're usually not actually brighter.

869
00:50:31,292 --> 00:50:32,640
Rym: They're just at a higher angle.

870
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,372
Scott: And they light up a wider area, and they aim the bulbs higher.

871
00:50:37,733 --> 00:50:40,580
Scott: See, you might not realize this, but your headlights are aimed at the ground.

872
00:50:41,061 --> 00:50:46,174
Scott: The guy driving in front of you doesn't get his headlights, like, on his, you know, rearview mirror.

873
00:50:46,435 --> 00:50:48,460
Scott: They go onto the ground, they don't bother him so much.

874
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:52,380
Rym: Yeah, and also the guy oncoming in traffic doesn't get blinded by your freakin' lights.

875
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,604
Scott: Yeah, that's 'cause they're aimed down.

876
00:50:55,166 --> 00:51:01,120
Scott: The brights, also sometimes referred to as the, uh, I don't know, the high beams.

877
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:02,017
Rym: Yeah, high beams.

878
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:08,968
Scott: Uh, but basically they aim straight forward and sort of up and down and all around.

879
00:51:09,309 --> 00:51:17,439
Scott: So if you turn them on, anyone looking at them or anyone driving in front of you gets those things right in the eyes, and they go, "Ah, fuck,

880
00:51:17,859 --> 00:51:17,919
Scott: ow!".

881
00:51:18,621 --> 00:51:20,280
Rym: Now, these lights have two purposes.

882
00:51:21,524 --> 00:51:21,939
Scott: One purpose?

883
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:26,320
Rym: Well, first of all, in many cars now, especially more modern cars, there are two ways to use them.

884
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:27,800
Scott: Uh, my car has two ways to use them.

885
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,770
Rym: Yep, you can usually tap something and they'll flash once.

886
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:33,460
Rym: Or you can do something else to make them turn on.

887
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:40,567
Scott: Now, the number one, the original purpose of brights, uh, high beams, was to turn them on and keep them on.

888
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:49,857
Scott: You use this when you are alone in the dark at night with a road that has absolutely no street lights and you can't see shit.

889
00:51:50,097 --> 00:51:52,920
Scott: and there are no cars in front of you and no cars oncoming.

890
00:51:53,501 --> 00:51:56,292
Scott: So, it's pitch freakin' black and you can't see anything.

891
00:51:56,533 --> 00:51:58,200
Scott: You turn those on and now you can see.

892
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:03,200
Rym: Well, basically the etiquette of using brights is that you can use them anytime as long as there's no oncoming traffic.

893
00:52:03,882 --> 00:52:04,699
Scott: And no one in front of you.

894
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:05,461
Rym: Yeah.

895
00:52:05,481 --> 00:52:10,795
Rym: However, now, first off, for oncoming traffic, whenever an oncoming car comes, you have to turn your brights off.

896
00:52:11,376 --> 00:52:12,880
Rym: And then once they pass, you turn them back on.

897
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:12,984
Rym: Yep.

898
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:22,600
Rym: Now, if someone, well, I'll talk about signaling later, but the other thing is that, say there's three or four cars in a line going in the same direction on a freeway in the middle of the night.

899
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:32,640
Rym: Etiquette states that the person in the front will have his high beams on so that everyone can see the road better, but everyone else has them off so they're not blinding him through his rearview mirror.

900
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:33,380
Scott: Mm-hmm.

901
00:52:34,201 --> 00:52:36,703
Rym: Now, the other purpose of these lights is for signaling.

902
00:52:37,044 --> 00:52:38,505
Rym: I said earlier that you can flash them.

903
00:52:39,006 --> 00:52:51,558
Rym: There are all sorts of standards all over the world for how you can signal people, but basically what I've come to learn is that you flash them once to tell someone else, "Hey, asshole, your high beams are on and they're blinding me.

904
00:52:51,638 --> 00:52:52,899
Rym: Turn them off before I shoot

905
00:52:52,939 --> 00:52:53,040
Rym: you.".

906
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:59,176
Scott: Also, it's very good to signal people like, "Hey, asshole, you have your parking lights and/or no headlights on.

907
00:52:59,216 --> 00:52:59,898
Scott: Turn them the fuck

908
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:00,219
Scott: on.".

909
00:53:00,801 --> 00:53:07,060
Rym: Actually, I've seen that lately a lot of people, when they want to signal someone to turn their lights on, they turn their lights off and then back on.

910
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,598
Scott: Sometimes that's a good one, too.

911
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:18,640
Rym: That one's good because it doesn't misconstrue because universally, the one universal use of high beam lights flashing them is if you're trying to pass someone, you flash them twice.

912
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:19,040
Scott: Yep.

913
00:53:19,221 --> 00:53:25,757
Scott: If you're behind someone on the road, say in the left lane, and you want to go around them, but there is no left lane.

914
00:53:25,777 --> 00:53:26,840
Scott: You're in the left lane already.

915
00:53:27,241 --> 00:53:34,635
Rym: Or it's a two-lane road, literally two lanes opposing directions, and you're behind someone and you're about to pass them over a dotted yellow.

916
00:53:34,975 --> 00:53:36,939
Rym: You just flash twice to say, "I'm going to pass

917
00:53:36,979 --> 00:53:37,059
Rym: you.".

918
00:53:39,361 --> 00:53:40,383
Scott: It's also a good one.

919
00:53:40,523 --> 00:53:47,118
Scott: If someone's going really slow and you're stuck behind them in the left lane, you can blink them like, "Hey, asshole, get the fuck out of my

920
00:53:47,158 --> 00:53:47,399
Scott: way.".

921
00:53:48,521 --> 00:53:55,773
Rym: A lot of people, at least in America, seem to take offense to being flashed their bites at, but I actually learned about all this in Driver's Ed.

922
00:53:55,793 --> 00:53:58,978
Rym: This is real.

923
00:53:59,018 --> 00:53:59,659
Rym: This is a standard.

924
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,180
Rym: This is what you do.

925
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:04,950
Rym: If someone behind you flashes their lights at you twice, they're not being an asshole.

926
00:54:05,632 --> 00:54:07,897
Rym: They're not trying to intimidate you or anything, usually.

927
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:09,100
Rym: They just want to pass you.

928
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:11,411
Scott: If they're honking their horn, that's something else.

929
00:54:11,632 --> 00:54:13,000
Scott: Let's talk about horn honking next.

930
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:15,800
Rym: Yeah, we'll talk about that next because people really overuse the horn.

931
00:54:16,021 --> 00:54:17,913
Scott: And some people underuse the horn, like me.

932
00:54:18,336 --> 00:54:19,000
Scott: I underuse the horn.

933
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:20,705
Scott: Okay, so, brights.

934
00:54:20,825 --> 00:54:24,600
Scott: If someone flashes their brights at you, they're trying to tell you something, check your stuff.

935
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:31,957
Scott: Sometimes they'll flash their brights like, "Hey, your trunk's open," or, "Hey, shit's falling off your car," or, "Hey, your gas cap is open," or, you know, all kinds.

936
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,100
Scott: They're trying to tell you something.

937
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,924
Rym: Now, here's the kind of standard I've learned.

938
00:54:35,165 --> 00:54:37,712
Rym: Flash once usually means your high beams are on.

939
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:38,213
Rym: Turn them off.

940
00:54:38,774 --> 00:54:40,198
Rym: Flash twice is, "I want to pass

941
00:54:40,218 --> 00:54:40,319
Rym: you.".

942
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,951
Rym: Three times usually means there's a cop up the road with a speed trap.

943
00:54:45,773 --> 00:54:48,440
Rym: I've seen that one often, and everyone always does three flashes.

944
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:58,377
Scott: Another good signal for, "Hey, there are cops," is if you're on a highway or a fast, fast road, and people way ahead of you all turn their brake lights on in succession.

945
00:54:59,139 --> 00:54:59,720
Rym: That's cops.

946
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,720
Scott: Or blinky brake lights, like blinky blinky blinky blinky blink.

947
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:07,939
Rym: Honestly, if I see a speed trap, I'll tap my brakes a whole bunch of times just so I'll warn people behind me.

948
00:55:08,402 --> 00:55:10,680
Scott: Yep, after I slow down to avoid the ticket.

949
00:55:12,921 --> 00:55:18,900
Rym: Now, if anyone flashes them more than three times, they're probably trying to tell you that your car's on fire or your muffler fell off or something.

950
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:26,080
Scott: Basically, whenever you see in your rearview mirror lights that are annoying you, check everything you can possibly check in your car.

951
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:27,379
Rym: Yeah, look at all your gauges.

952
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:35,880
Scott: Pull over into the right lane, start smelling stuff, start looking around, pay attention to what the hell's going on, and forget the radio and forget everyone in your car.

953
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:36,945
Rym: 'Cause most people aren't jerks.

954
00:55:36,986 --> 00:55:38,896
Rym: They're not just flashing their bikes at you for the hell of it.

955
00:55:38,916 --> 00:55:39,740
Rym: They notice something.

956
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,404
Scott: Get in the right lane and check everything you can check.

957
00:55:42,545 --> 00:55:50,400
Scott: And the other thing is, if you get in the right lane, sometimes the person, if they're behind you, will pull up to the left of you and try to communicate with you if there's something really going on.

958
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:54,219
Rym: Yeah, they'll give you the nice point to your trunk, so you know, "Alright, something's--oh, yeah, my trunk's open.

959
00:55:54,279 --> 00:55:54,400
Rym: Great.".

960
00:55:54,400 --> 00:56:01,620
Scott: Yeah, so if that kind of thing happens, you know, then you can pull over and fix it and get back on the road instead of driving shittily for a long time.

961
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,322
Rym: Now, horn honking.

962
00:56:03,422 --> 00:56:06,286
Rym: A lot of people use honking the horn to get someone's attention.

963
00:56:06,787 --> 00:56:10,232
Rym: Never honk your horn to, you know, get around someone or anything.

964
00:56:10,512 --> 00:56:16,280
Rym: There is one and only one use for honking your horn, and that is to warn other drivers of immediate impending danger.

965
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:27,377
Scott: Or, at the same time, when you're warning someone of immediate impending danger, you're also, you know, what would we say, scolding the person who caused the immediate danger.

966
00:56:27,497 --> 00:56:29,240
Scott: if there was a person causing immediate danger?

967
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,503
Rym: Yes, but that's a side effect.

968
00:56:30,603 --> 00:56:32,628
Rym: Never use the horn just to scold someone.

969
00:56:32,969 --> 00:56:37,520
Rym: If someone cuts you off and the danger is already averted, don't honk your horn at them after the fact.

970
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:49,520
Scott: Yeah, but if someone is, like, in the right lane and you're in the left lane and they start coming in on you, like they're gonna ram into you from the side, which means they obviously don't see you there, start honking because that'll wake them the fuck up and they won't hit you.

971
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,420
Rym: Yep, or in the very least, it'll cause them to hesitate just long enough for you to slow down and get out of their way.

972
00:56:54,681 --> 00:56:57,439
Scott: Or speed up and get out of their way, or swerve and get out of their way.

973
00:56:58,061 --> 00:57:03,331
Scott: I see a lot of people when a dangerous situation happens, like someone's about to cut them off.

974
00:57:03,732 --> 00:57:08,040
Scott: The only reaction they ever have is slam on the brakes, which I guess is good if you have anti-lock brakes.

975
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,680
Rym: Yeah, but sometimes that's bad.

976
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:10,741
Scott: Sometimes it's bad.

977
00:57:11,222 --> 00:57:23,540
Scott: Always never neglect the possibility that stepping on the gas and/or, very important, in fact, the best possible thing you can do when there's danger is steer out of the way with the wheel.

978
00:57:24,241 --> 00:57:30,900
Scott: The gas and the brake come second because, you know, usually speeding up to get out of the way and slowing down to get out of the way are pretty equal.

979
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:34,579
Scott: Depending, unless, you know, the danger is right in front of you, then you want to slow down, but...

980
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:39,460
Rym: Yeah, but when in doubt, don't slam on the brakes, but slow down and turn away from whatever the danger is.

981
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:48,200
Scott: Turning away from the danger can save, that's really the purpose of a seatbelt, is not to keep, is, yeah, okay, it keeps your head from smashing into shit and all that.

982
00:57:48,541 --> 00:57:55,780
Scott: The real purpose of the seatbelt is to keep the driver in the driver's seat in a position in which they can still control the vehicle.

983
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:58,305
Scott: That is the number one purpose of the seatbelt.

984
00:57:58,746 --> 00:58:04,840
Scott: So, if you're the driver and you're in a position, you know, where you can control the vehicle, use the steering wheel.

985
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:06,068
Scott: That's the number one thing.

986
00:58:06,088 --> 00:58:07,419
Scott: That's why it's up where your face is.

987
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,763
Rym: Now, we'll do another episode.

988
00:58:08,803 --> 00:58:14,920
Rym: I could talk forever on all the different, like, situations, or say you're skidding, how to get out of it, depending on your car.

989
00:58:15,381 --> 00:58:19,589
Rym: But, to put it very briefly, most people in this country now have a front-wheel-drive car.

990
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:34,140
Rym: If you have a front-wheel-drive car, and you're in any sort of skidding, swerving danger, the best generic advice, if you don't know how to drive better, is to look in the direction you want the car to go in, and turn the wheel in the direction you want the car to go in.

991
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:43,860
Rym: Because front-wheel-drive cars tend, in a very general sense, to go in the direction, well basically, a front-wheel-drive car will go in the direction the wheels are pointed.

992
00:58:44,181 --> 00:58:47,327
Rym: And a rear-wheel-drive car will go in the direction the car is pointed.

993
00:58:48,169 --> 00:58:49,332
Rym: That's a big distinction.

994
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:53,240
Rym: But if you have a rear-wheel-drive car, you probably know more about driving it, so I don't have to go into it.

995
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:56,567
Scott: Yeah, rear-wheel-drive cars, you probably don't have a rear-wheel-drive car.

996
00:58:56,668 --> 00:58:57,530
Scott: If you do, you know it.

997
00:58:57,550 --> 00:59:02,020
Scott: We're talking about things like a Ford Mustang is like the minimum rear-wheel-drive car.

998
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:02,672
Rym: Yeah, like an RX7.

999
00:59:03,421 --> 00:59:12,815
Scott: A Mazda RX7, a lot of Ferraris, Corvettes are rear-wheel-drive, Dodge Vipers, you probably don't have a rear-wheel-drive car.

1000
00:59:13,196 --> 00:59:15,379
Scott: If you have a four-wheel-drive car, whatever, you know.

1001
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:20,280
Rym: Yeah, now four-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive are very different, but that's beyond the scope of this show.

1002
00:59:21,341 --> 00:59:29,940
Scott: Yeah, all I want to say is that just because you have four-wheel-drive, and it's snowing, that doesn't mean you can go faster than anyone else.

1003
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:30,442
Rym: Yeah, you can.

1004
00:59:30,462 --> 00:59:32,029
Rym: You can get faster real quick.

1005
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:34,460
Rym: You can't stop any faster, and you can't turn any better.

1006
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:36,263
Scott: It's not really that much safer.

1007
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:45,498
Scott: All it does is help you go so your car won't get stuck in a parking spot full of snow, but don't drive it on the road like, "Oh, it doesn't matter if there's snow on the road.

1008
00:59:45,578 --> 00:59:45,759
Scott: I have

1009
00:59:45,799 --> 00:59:46,600
Scott: four-wheel-drive.".

1010
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:51,400
Scott: No, you still have the same amount of rubber touching the ground with the same amount of friction as everyone else.

1011
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:56,368
Rym: Yep, because say I've got two-wheel-drive, and both my wheels are on a frictionless surface.

1012
00:59:56,709 --> 00:59:57,490
Rym: I can't go anywhere.

1013
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,676
Rym: If the road is ice and you've got four-wheel-drive, well, guess what?

1014
01:00:00,696 --> 01:00:02,519
Rym: You've got four wheels on a frictionless surface.

1015
01:00:02,539 --> 01:00:03,340
Rym: You're not getting anywhere.

1016
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:04,620
Rym: Yep, all right.

1017
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:11,120
Rym: All right, the last thing we're going to talk about, because we've gone kind of long here, and we'll definitely, if you guys like this, do more things on driving.

1018
01:00:11,901 --> 01:00:21,100
Rym: But basically, and this doesn't apply to a lot of places in the South and in Jersey, where for some reason they put yield signs and stop signs in just ass places.

1019
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:22,442
Scott: Oh yeah, I hate that shit.

1020
01:00:22,602 --> 01:00:31,400
Scott: But when merging onto a highway, now this is sort of like the trickiest thing about highway driving, because once you're on a highway, it's easy as hell.

1021
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,845
Scott: And exiting from a highway is also easy as hell.

1022
01:00:33,865 --> 01:00:36,170
Scott: You just turn right and stop, you know, and slow down.

1023
01:00:36,691 --> 01:00:40,380
Scott: But getting onto a highway is really the only tricky part of highway driving.

1024
01:00:41,301 --> 01:00:47,660
Scott: Getting onto a highway, there's a ramp, usually, if there's no stop sign or yield sign, in which case, you know, just stop or yield.

1025
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:49,065
Rym: Now we're talking very generically.

1026
01:00:49,105 --> 01:00:50,672
Rym: There are some highways that may be different.

1027
01:00:50,732 --> 01:00:52,700
Rym: Just do whatever the situation deems appropriate.

1028
01:00:52,720 --> 01:01:03,540
Scott: Yeah, we're talking about when there's a nice long ramp, and then, you know, there's a merge lane, so you merge into traffic that's already going, you know, by going left in the United States.

1029
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:06,267
Rym: First off, say you're on a highway and someone's trying to merge.

1030
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:10,940
Rym: Unless you have a reason not to, move one lane to the left and let them in for free.

1031
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:11,392
Scott: Yep.

1032
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:14,059
Rym: Like, that's even a law in some states.

1033
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:23,640
Scott: If you can't do that, either speed up or slow, you know, usually you want to speed up if you can, but if you can't speed up or go, if you can't go to the left lane, speed up.

1034
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:27,100
Scott: If you can't speed up, slow down to give them a spot to enter the highway.

1035
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:33,180
Rym: Yep, because right-of-way on a freeway is tricky when it comes to merging, because basically you're obligated to let people merge.

1036
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:38,814
Rym: Unless, of course, there's big traffic, and traffic just- If there's big traffic, in many states, you're obligated to let them zipper in.

1037
01:01:38,835 --> 01:01:40,040
Rym: You have to let at least one person in.

1038
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:40,601
Scott: Yeah.

1039
01:01:41,183 --> 01:01:45,016
Scott: That's generally the etiquette is let one in, then go, let one in, then go, but whatever.

1040
01:01:45,277 --> 01:01:46,060
Scott: Traffic, who cares?

1041
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:54,100
Scott: We're talking about in normal situations, to merge onto a highway, while you're on the ramp, step on the freaking gas.

1042
01:01:54,762 --> 01:02:00,460
Scott: You have to be going as fast as everyone is going on the highway before you get onto the highway.

1043
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:06,956
Scott: I see too many people, just today, there was a guy on the highway on ramp, he was going 20, 20 miles an hour.

1044
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:14,520
Scott: The speed limit on this highway was officially 55, most people drive 70 or 80.

1045
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:21,880
Scott: So he was getting into the right lane of a highway that goes, you know, people driving 65, usually, going 20.

1046
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:28,577
Scott: That means he gets on the highway going 20 miles an hour in front of someone else going 65, and then he accelerates.

1047
01:02:29,118 --> 01:02:29,960
Scott: That's not good.

1048
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,640
Rym: That's dangerous as hell.

1049
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,082
Scott: That's super dangerous.

1050
01:02:33,223 --> 01:02:38,493
Scott: I literally- almost literally stopped behind this guy on the on-ramp, so that I could use the-.

1051
01:02:38,674 --> 01:02:41,840
Scott: you know, I didn't eat up all my space on the on-ramp, so I could accelerate.

1052
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:48,138
Scott: When you get to the end of the on-ramp, you should be going the speed that everyone on the highway is going, which is, you know, 65, whatever.

1053
01:02:50,023 --> 01:02:51,800
Scott: On the on-ramp, step on the gas.

1054
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:58,660
Scott: If you don't hear your car going, "Ehh, ehh, ehh, ehh," and faster and faster, you're doing something wrong.

1055
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:10,540
Rym: I mean, obviously, like, some trucks can't do that, and basically- Whenever there's a car in front of you that can't speed up like that, don't just sit right behind them all the way up the ramp, hang back a bit so that you'll have space to accelerate.

1056
01:03:12,141 --> 01:03:20,140
Scott: And then, once you get to the end of the ramp, so you're going- let's say you're going 65, and the cars in the right lane of the highway are going 65, and you want to get in between them.

1057
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:29,738
Scott: Find an open spot, and don't use the brakes so much as you use the accelerator to kind of shift back and forth, because they're not going to stop going 65, you know?

1058
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:35,480
Scott: So, if you let go of the accelerator, they'll go a little faster than you when you can get in behind them.

1059
01:03:35,901 --> 01:03:38,699
Scott: Or if you want to get in front of them, step on it a little more and get in front of them.

1060
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:44,920
Scott: But always keep one eye looking forward and one eye looking to the left, because you might run out of ramp, and then you'll die.

1061
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:51,400
Rym: Now, also, this is another situation, the other use for flashing lights, and usually people use two flashes for this.

1062
01:03:52,061 --> 01:04:01,759
Rym: If you're behind someone, and they have their signal on, or they're trying to merge in front of you in any way on a freeway, you flash your lights twice to say, "I'm clear of you, it's okay for you to get in front of

1063
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:01,880
Rym: me.".

1064
01:04:02,641 --> 01:04:11,780
Rym: So, if you see someone trying to merge, and they're not merging, but you've given them enough space, they might not be able to tell that you've given them enough space, because cars are kind of long, and sometimes you can't see.

1065
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:17,358
Rym: Flash them twice, that means, "Hey, I'm behind you, I can see that you have enough space, get in front of

1066
01:04:17,399 --> 01:04:17,459
Rym: me.".

1067
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:25,700
Scott: Oh, and as soon as you get, actually before, while you're going on the on-ramp, as you're accelerating, turn on your little left signal light.

1068
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:30,560
Scott: That way, people know you're trying to get into the highway, because sometimes people get on and get off and don't even bother to merge.

1069
01:04:30,961 --> 01:04:38,380
Scott: And in that case, don't put the signal light on, and that way people will know they don't have to make room for you, because you're just getting right off, you're just going on the ramps for fun.

1070
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:41,908
Scott: But yeah, when you're getting onto a highway, signal.

1071
01:04:42,129 --> 01:04:45,379
Scott: That tells the guys, "Oh, this guy's trying to get in here, we need to make

1072
01:04:45,419 --> 01:04:45,580
Scott: room.".

1073
01:04:46,681 --> 01:04:49,719
Rym: So, we've talked about this probably longer than you care to listen to it.

1074
01:04:50,806 --> 01:04:51,039
Scott: Awesome.

1075
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:55,445
Rym: But I imagine, if you guys like this at all, we'll definitely do it again.

1076
01:04:55,506 --> 01:05:02,355
Rym: We can talk in more detail about ways to avoid accidents, what to do if you're in an accident, all sorts of driving stuff.

1077
01:05:02,395 --> 01:05:05,840
Rym: that, while, I mean, this stuff should all be taught in Driver's Ed.

1078
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:08,532
Scott: This stuff should all be on some car podcast somewhere.

1079
01:05:08,753 --> 01:05:10,080
Scott: We're a geek podcast, what the hell?

1080
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:13,580
Rym: Yeah, you know what, it's Thursday, it's Non-Geek Day, it's whatever we want to talk about day.

1081
01:05:14,121 --> 01:05:15,900
Scott: Well, I guess there are car geeks, that counts.

1082
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:16,472
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

1083
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:17,498
Scott: Driving geeks.

1084
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:18,895
Scott: Nichelle D.

1085
01:05:19,401 --> 01:05:22,722
Rym: Yeah, but I mean, in the end- Thursdays are free-for-alls.

1086
01:05:22,782 --> 01:05:31,680
Rym: We talk about whatever, because, basically, we couldn't come up with a fourth geekery that we were in-depth enough about, or that we had enough to say about it.

1087
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:33,159
Scott: Yeah, every week.

1088
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:33,847
Rym: Yeah.

1089
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:34,228
Rym: Yeah.

1090
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:36,970
Rym: I mean, this is our 64th episode.

1091
01:05:37,372 --> 01:05:40,220
Scott: We put out more podcasts- Ooh, 64, that's a power of 2.

1092
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:40,273
Rym: Ah.

1093
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:40,843
Rym: Woot.

1094
01:05:41,491 --> 01:05:42,340
Rym: Powers of 2.

1095
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:45,941
Rym: We're not celebrating powers of 10, we're celebrating powers of 2.

1096
01:05:45,941 --> 01:05:46,986
Scott: 64th episode, what up?

1097
01:05:47,489 --> 01:05:49,459
Scott: We gotta celebrate in the 128th episode, the 256th episode.

1098
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,620
Rym: You know what, we're not gonna have so many celebrations.

1099
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:53,059
Scott: That's cool, that's cool.

1100
01:05:54,080 --> 01:06:03,736
Scott: 'Cause then we could, after like, the 256th episode, we might make it to the 512th episode, but there's no way we're gonna make it to like, the 2048 or the 50... 86, or whatever.

1101
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:08,376
Rym: I don't know, I could see that, if we keep doing this for the next 10 years.

1102
01:06:09,843 --> 01:06:12,020
Scott: I don't think we'll make it to like, the 2048.

1103
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:12,383
Rym: Why not?

1104
01:06:12,565 --> 01:06:13,855
Rym: How long has Penny Arcade been going?

1105
01:06:13,956 --> 01:06:14,460
Rym: Webcomics?

1106
01:06:15,401 --> 01:06:16,304
Scott: I don't know, but still.

1107
01:06:17,207 --> 01:06:21,100
Scott: Anyway, we're not gonna make it to the, uh, the Gigabyte episode.

1108
01:06:21,342 --> 01:06:21,939
Rym: I think we will.

1109
01:06:22,701 --> 01:06:24,540
Scott: Maybe the Gigabit episode, but not the Gigabyte.

1110
01:06:26,881 --> 01:06:31,640
Rym: Alright, so once again, we'll be, at least Scott, maybe the rest of us will be at the New York Comic Con this weekend.

1111
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:32,084
Rym: Mhm.

1112
01:06:33,221 --> 01:06:35,197
Rym: And we'll let you know about all the other cons we'll be at.

1113
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:35,766
Rym: Yep.

1114
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:39,820
Rym: It was cool to meet fans at KatsuCon, I hope you meet fans at every other con I go to.

1115
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:40,230
Rym: Yep.

1116
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:48,560
Rym: And, once again, sometime soon we're gonna get all of our new audio equipment, and expect a drastic improvement in the audio quality.

1117
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:57,919
Scott: Oh, also, um, there's a Frapper map, which is like this little pushpin map, where you say, "I'm a listener of GeekNights, and this is where I am in the

1118
01:06:57,959 --> 01:06:58,160
Scott: world.".

1119
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:05,340
Rym: Yeah, there's a link to the right, and Scott will probably post something in the forums about it again, but go ahead and use it, 'cause I forgot it was there until Scott mentioned it.

1120
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:05,902
Scott: Yeah, I keep forgetting.

1121
01:07:05,943 --> 01:07:09,720
Scott: I set this thing up, and I just remembered it today, and there were some new people on there, which is pretty cool.

1122
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:11,736
Scott: Like a guy in Australia, and a guy in Britain, so...

1123
01:07:12,382 --> 01:07:14,360
Rym: Yeah, those two guys are like some of our first listeners.

1124
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:15,359
Scott: Yeah, they're awesome.

1125
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:15,660
Scott: Yeah.

1126
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:26,997
Scott: So, if you're, uh, if you're listening to this show, or you ever listen to our show, uh, go to this little webpage in the forum, or it's also on, there's a link on the right-hand side of frontrowcrew.com.

1127
01:07:27,478 --> 01:07:28,900
Scott: that's under, uh, my links.

1128
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:31,140
Rym: Yeah, we'll probably move it somewhere once we redo the set.

1129
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,699
Scott: Yeah, it says Frapper map.

1130
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:39,820
Rym: Basically, it just puts a dot, you can say where you are, and it puts a dot there, so you can see a dot of all the GeekNights listeners who have bothered to do this.

1131
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,992
Scott: Yeah, so, go and put a dot there, 'cause then it'll be awesome.

1132
01:07:43,554 --> 01:07:44,960
Scott: And you can also put your picture in a saying.

1133
01:07:45,302 --> 01:07:45,739
Rym: If you want.

1134
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:46,440
Scott: If you want, whatever.

1135
01:07:46,481 --> 01:07:47,199
Rym: I don't know if I did.

1136
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,320
Scott: I didn't put a pic- oh, you did, you put a shitty picture of you where you still had a mustache.

1137
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:50,668
Scott: I did?

1138
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,440
Scott: From, like, high school or something.

1139
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:53,168
Rym: High school?

1140
01:07:53,208 --> 01:07:54,060
Rym: I thought it was from high school.

1141
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:55,219
Scott: It might've been from high school.

1142
01:07:55,725 --> 01:07:56,239
Rym: I doubt it.

1143
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,720
Scott: It might've, or, either that, or it was early, early, early college.

1144
01:07:59,361 --> 01:08:03,040
Rym: I'll bet it was from, there was that time Steve Pomeroy was at our house and took a bunch of pictures of us.

1145
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:04,686
Scott: I don't know, this seems earlier than that.

1146
01:08:04,887 --> 01:08:06,273
Scott: It was bright behind your head.

1147
01:08:06,313 --> 01:08:06,895
Scott: Go look at it.

1148
01:08:07,216 --> 01:08:08,120
Scott: We'll talk about it one day.

1149
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:08,976
Rym: Alright, alright, yeah.

1150
01:08:08,996 --> 01:08:09,200
Rym: We're out.

1151
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:09,697
Rym: We're out.

1152
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:19,349
Rym: And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1153
01:08:19,609 --> 01:08:21,939
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

1154
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:26,759
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontrowcrew.com.
