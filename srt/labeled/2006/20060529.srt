1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,370
Rym: It's Monday May 29th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:12,932 --> 00:00:24,630
Rym: I have just returned from an amazement and as it is the holiday and in addition We are both very tired from the weekend today is somewhat of a cop-out episode though We do have a fairly interesting discussion on patents during the news bits.

3
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:32,688
Rym: For any and all of our new listeners who are coming here looking for actual coverage of an amazement It will be on Wednesday, which is our normal anime day.

4
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,358
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:35,378 --> 00:00:40,183
Rym: I Am back from a crazy ass weekend.

6
00:00:40,384 --> 00:00:41,850
Rym: I'm absolutely exhausted.

7
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:49,819
Rym: I flew in early afternoon on a little prop plane puddle jumper that took me back to Stewart Airport And then I slept until I heard Scott come home.

8
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:55,203
Scott: You know I came home well before you awoke and You were still sleeping.

9
00:00:55,263 --> 00:01:00,214
Scott: so well I was awake, and then I went back to sleep now because I came in the house And you were.

10
00:01:00,356 --> 00:01:05,470
Scott: you were completely knocked out And then you didn't make a noise until I opened the door to look at you.

11
00:01:05,591 --> 00:01:08,144
Rym: Well actually I woke up, and I saw your.

12
00:01:08,224 --> 00:01:09,270
Rym: I woke up, and I looked out the window.

13
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,922
Rym: I saw your car pulled in then I went back to sleep.

14
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:17,965
Scott: uh-huh yeah Cuz see I opened your door, and then I closed it and then you made a noise And then you didn't come out.

15
00:01:19,071 --> 00:01:23,670
Rym: I spent the last five days getting not enough sleep and doing craziness.

16
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:26,836
Scott: I did a bunch of stuff while you weren't here.

17
00:01:26,856 --> 00:01:34,330
Scott: I did more in like Friday night than you did all weekend man Yeah, but all you did was you went to an anime convention.

18
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,234
Scott: I did stuff.

19
00:01:35,716 --> 00:01:36,459
Rym: Yeah, you did all right.

20
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:36,840
Rym: I didn't.

21
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,366
Scott: just it's like saying man.

22
00:01:38,386 --> 00:01:39,290
Scott: I went on vacation.

23
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:48,590
Rym: I did so much yeah, except let me put it this way I will have my coverage of an amazement on Wednesday anime day though first I'd like to say an amazement was freaking amazing.

24
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:50,989
Rym: It was an amazing

25
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:53,255
Scott: Not funny,

26
00:01:53,858 --> 00:02:10,630
Rym: but it was a really freaking awesome convention And I basically went from just being some schmuck going to being a panelist to being full-on staff over the course of maybe Six hours, and I ended up basically being crowd control and security for the entirety of the convention.

27
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:12,997
Scott: It's good to be awesome.

28
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:24,029
Rym: Yeah, and I was surprised they were Really impressed with the way I handled lines and crowd control and security and I you know the kinds of stuff We just kind of did back at RIT all the time.

29
00:02:24,591 --> 00:02:30,613
Scott: Yep, you know some things come naturally to some people or you know how to do something in other people You know.

30
00:02:30,754 --> 00:02:32,327
Scott: not so many people know how to do it.

31
00:02:32,871 --> 00:02:36,246
Scott: So you come across someone who's never seen anyone do it properly.

32
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:37,210
Scott: see they don't know.

33
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:41,850
Scott: What's the real deal is you come around with what you consider to be basic skills?

34
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:49,230
Scott: And you know it's like this one village or everyone has a bow and arrow And they know how to use it and the other village No one's ever seen a bow and arrow in their lives.

35
00:02:49,571 --> 00:02:52,043
Scott: So you go to the other village, and they think you're some kind of crazy.

36
00:02:52,063 --> 00:02:53,490
Scott: God with your bow and arrow skills.

37
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,935
Scott: And yeah, it's a good analogy.

38
00:02:55,955 --> 00:03:09,689
Rym: I think yeah, I mean they actually they do one thing really really well in terms of how they Actually set up lines and prevent people from standing in line that I'm gonna really try to push to make Otakon do Because holy shit did it save time.

39
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:11,956
Scott: Always good to save time.

40
00:03:12,016 --> 00:03:14,708
Rym: Yeah, they have this system of how to get people lined up for the cosplay.

41
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:15,250
Rym: That's just fantastic.

42
00:03:17,011 --> 00:03:17,773
Scott: Systems are good.

43
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:25,575
Scott: the problem is as you know if the system requires more work the more people you have the more breaks down Like trying.

44
00:03:25,655 --> 00:03:26,680
Scott: it's like when you try to get people.

45
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:27,986
Scott: is another analogy ready.

46
00:03:28,006 --> 00:03:28,649
Scott: It's analogy day.

47
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:36,429
Scott: When you go to a Sporting event the more people you try to get to chant something in unison the less complex that thing has to be.

48
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:37,994
Rym: But yet this system.

49
00:03:38,315 --> 00:03:49,855
Rym: I'll talk about it in great depth on third on Wednesday, but basically it seems to scale I'll say it linearly With the number of people.

50
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:53,307
Rym: so for every you know a hundred people in line you directly over maybe 200 people in line.

51
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,127
Rym: You'll need one staffer to manage them.

52
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:57,596
Rym: Give or take.

53
00:03:57,616 --> 00:04:00,050
Rym: that's my assessment, and I'm pretty sure it's a linear relationship.

54
00:04:00,711 --> 00:04:03,969
Rym: That's good, so I'll we'll see I'll push for it.

55
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:09,110
Rym: But the the staff of an amazement was awesome, and I will go every year forever more.

56
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:17,548
Scott: I will have crazy coverage including all the interviews I did on Wednesday, so actually gonna do it or you cut up all that audio Or are you just gonna pretend that you're gonna do it?

57
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:20,884
Rym: Well, I did it last time for the other time at our con.

58
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,029
Scott: didn't it take you two weeks?

59
00:04:22,651 --> 00:04:22,912
Rym: What?

60
00:04:23,253 --> 00:04:26,061
Scott: no no no remembering incorrectly Katsucon was the one.

61
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:29,110
Rym: it was trouble because right I used Scott Johnson had a paper car.

62
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:29,862
Scott: That's right.

63
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:30,370
Scott: That's right.

64
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:35,870
Rym: I remember I was sitting there trying and we discovered that I don't have a single working tape player in this house.

65
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:39,908
Rym: That's right as I took apart every single one of them and found them all to be broken.

66
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:42,136
Scott: yep Yeah, I think we got it straight now.

67
00:04:42,497 --> 00:04:43,500
Rym: I got some good interviews.

68
00:04:44,544 --> 00:04:46,129
Rym: I don't want any one particularly interesting.

69
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:53,390
Rym: Actually I interviewed a gaggle of somewhat cute to incredibly cute fangirls and one fanboy.

70
00:04:53,571 --> 00:04:54,437
Scott: That's not very good.

71
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,001
Rym: No.

72
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,270
Rym: It's actually a really good interview.

73
00:04:57,191 --> 00:05:02,190
Rym: Everyone was very excited about being interviewed for anything so I tried to not do my standard.

74
00:05:02,331 --> 00:05:07,794
Rym: You know ask them about the con itself, and I try to ask him more general questions about you know Why do you like anime?

75
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:08,879
Rym: Why do you go to conventions?

76
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,462
Rym: Why are you here?

77
00:05:09,502 --> 00:05:10,889
Rym: Why are you dressed up as a cat boy?

78
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:25,610
Rym: And I got the same answer from everyone even people who didn't know each other And they gave the same answer that we always give because it geeks come together And this is the only place where geeks can just be geeks and meet other geeks and be within our own culture.

79
00:05:27,372 --> 00:05:28,456
Rym: So yeah, I got some good interviews.

80
00:05:28,477 --> 00:05:31,910
Rym: I met some interesting people and the con was freaking amazing.

81
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:40,970
Rym: now today's episode is going to be a little short partly because a Drawback of the con being amazing is that I didn't really sleep much for the last five days

82
00:05:41,894 --> 00:05:49,138
Scott: and I've been doing all sorts of other shit like being on other people's podcasts and Playing board games

83
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:49,701
Rym: yeah

84
00:05:49,861 --> 00:05:58,610
Scott: and driving to my house And yeah, so I don't have that much to go and we don't have a main bit planned.

85
00:05:58,831 --> 00:06:01,402
Rym: Yeah, today's gonna be a little bit of a cop-out, but tomorrow.

86
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:03,270
Rym: We'll have a bunch of stuff Wednesday.

87
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,136
Rym: It's gonna be super long Thursday.

88
00:06:05,176 --> 00:06:11,296
Scott: We'll probably have a bunch of stuff, so I'll probably just do news thing of the day and then Something else.

89
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,968
Rym: we'll talk until we run out of time.

90
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:17,062
Rym: yep To any of our new listeners out there because I know a lot of people.

91
00:06:17,123 --> 00:06:19,070
Rym: I I printed out some flyers for GeekNights.

92
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:19,653
Rym: I forgot there.

93
00:06:19,673 --> 00:06:22,988
Scott: already one person already joined the forum who saw your flyer really cuz.

94
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:27,726
Rym: I Forgot to bring my stuff with me to the convention like I left it here.

95
00:06:27,806 --> 00:06:28,790
Rym: I had a flyer already.

96
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:32,166
Rym: I was gonna you know print at the hotel and pass out like a nice one now.

97
00:06:33,431 --> 00:06:47,658
Rym: So I actually commissioned an artist who was sitting next to me in the artists alley while I was manning the artist alley stafftable for a while and I commissioned her for the price of one coffee to dry me up a Crick crick stick figure little figure

98
00:06:47,878 --> 00:06:48,199
Scott: thing

99
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:54,425
Rym: and then I went to the hotel and actually got the business travelers Discount and made a bunch of copies and put them all over the event.

100
00:06:54,465 --> 00:06:55,530
Scott: you should have commissioned a logo.

101
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:56,754
Scott: We still need logo.

102
00:06:56,774 --> 00:06:59,203
Rym: I wasn't gonna condition anything big.

103
00:06:59,263 --> 00:07:01,210
Rym: I was mostly busy doing other things.

104
00:07:01,872 --> 00:07:02,834
Scott: Yeah, we're still.

105
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:06,925
Scott: you know we're getting some a couple more entries, but there's still nothing.

106
00:07:06,965 --> 00:07:07,666
Scott: that's like aha.

107
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:08,408
Scott: That's the one.

108
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:12,669
Rym: yeah We've got one that we're real close to picking, but it really we want to see more.

109
00:07:13,373 --> 00:07:15,204
Rym: Remember there's prizes involved and fame.

110
00:07:15,627 --> 00:07:17,669
Scott: yes cash.

111
00:07:21,451 --> 00:07:21,832
Scott: Well how come?

112
00:07:21,892 --> 00:07:29,063
Scott: every other podcast in the world gets like original theme music right away and An original cool logo right away, and we don't have that.

113
00:07:29,103 --> 00:07:30,208
Rym: we'd have plenty of original music.

114
00:07:30,248 --> 00:07:34,310
Rym: the problem Is we want jazz music which I don't have the means to just create on my own.

115
00:07:34,491 --> 00:07:38,590
Scott: But every other podcast in the universe got like a real slick logo real quick and easy.

116
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,474
Scott: How come we can't do this?

117
00:07:39,494 --> 00:07:42,650
Rym: because we care a lot more about what our logo looks like and we're real.

118
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,989
Rym: But they have good logos too, and yeah, we're all picky and anal even when we like one.

119
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:53,679
Rym: We're like We're I mean like people were posting.

120
00:07:53,739 --> 00:08:02,530
Rym: I look through the forum briefly after my five-day Absence and people seem to always talk about how we care a lot about production values and quality and professionalism.

121
00:08:04,411 --> 00:08:04,773
Rym: What do you want?

122
00:08:04,793 --> 00:08:07,130
Rym: We're nuts for fastidious fastidious?

123
00:08:11,133 --> 00:08:15,595
Rym: Yeah consider them fastidious From tomorrow until Thursday.

124
00:08:15,716 --> 00:08:20,830
Rym: consider this to be our week's coverage of the Memorial Day weekend because we both had crazy weekends.

125
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:26,429
Rym: Yes, we did and once again like I was saying before we got sidetracked to all of our new listeners coming from an amazement.

126
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:45,890
Rym: I If you don't realize who I was at the convention I was the long-haired staffer guy who was pushing people into lines and sitting in the artists alley and many of you remember me as that tree guy or that elf guy in the tree because I was Quite literally sitting in a tree for much of the con.

127
00:08:46,931 --> 00:08:50,186
Scott: And if you don't know who I am, I was the guy who wasn't there.

128
00:08:50,206 --> 00:08:54,902
Rym: Yeah Though really you should come to an amazement next year.

129
00:08:54,942 --> 00:08:56,510
Rym: That was a freaking awesome con.

130
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,024
Scott: I'm probably gonna go to all the cons next year.

131
00:08:59,124 --> 00:08:59,949
Scott: Just not this year.

132
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:04,947
Rym: Well, see I'm laying the groundwork cuz we're probably gonna go to every con now as panelists staff or guests.

133
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:11,733
Rym: Mm-hmm I mean every time we've been to so far has invited us back except uber con, but they don't know that we were there Mm-hmm.

134
00:09:11,955 --> 00:09:13,769
Rym: I never actually told them lol.

135
00:09:15,251 --> 00:09:15,693
Rym: Doesn't matter.

136
00:09:15,714 --> 00:09:17,222
Rym: I actually don't want to do stuff at uber con.

137
00:09:17,243 --> 00:09:18,450
Rym: I want to play games at uber con.

138
00:09:18,671 --> 00:09:19,656
Scott: Yeah, tell me about it.

139
00:09:19,877 --> 00:09:21,727
Rym: If we did stuff at uber con we couldn't play games.

140
00:09:21,787 --> 00:09:22,149
Rym: We'd be doing.

141
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:25,021
Scott: no I'm probably gonna run some German board games at uber con.

142
00:09:25,102 --> 00:09:28,369
Rym: Yeah, if we get good enough by then We should try to run a burning wheel.

143
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,617
Scott: You really can't compete.

144
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:33,069
Scott: when the met with the master if he wasn't there I would do it.

145
00:09:33,352 --> 00:09:40,921
Rym: No, even if he was there I have this feeling that if we tried to run a burning wheel and Luke Crane knew about that He he would probably help out or think it was awesome.

146
00:09:41,383 --> 00:09:43,270
Scott: No, he'd come over and be like you guys doing it all wrong.

147
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,477
Scott: Okay, let me show you how it's done.

148
00:09:44,658 --> 00:09:45,121
Scott: That's fine.

149
00:09:45,161 --> 00:09:45,825
Scott: Maybe like thanks.

150
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:51,728
Rym: Yeah All right, anyway like today's a cop-out as you said multiple times.

151
00:09:53,052 --> 00:09:54,769
Rym: Yep, so we got some news though.

152
00:09:55,731 --> 00:10:02,990
Scott: Okay, my news apparently DirectX 10 will be available only on Windows Vista.

153
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:10,070
Rym: Alright, I guess I won't ever be seeing DirectX 10 related things me either.

154
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:24,230
Scott: It's kind of weird since everything else that Windows Vista is bringing such as support for well like Internet Explorer 7 those Windows photo files all this other stuff that they're putting into Vista.

155
00:10:24,571 --> 00:10:36,249
Scott: They're releasing packages so that you can install it on XP and it's like the new Windows Media Player I think is gonna be for XP, you know but They're not bringing DirectX 10 to XP.

156
00:10:37,052 --> 00:10:48,167
Scott: this means that if when their games will eventually come out that require DirectX 10 and Those games won't work on Windows XP period.

157
00:10:49,571 --> 00:10:58,410
Scott: Also, if you get a video card that say DirectX 10 features You won't be able to take advantage of those features without Windows Vista.

158
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:11,470
Scott: You'll basically be stuck in DirectX 9 land forever and you might as well just buy the best DirectX 9 video card in the universe and use that and Never get a better one unless you're gonna get Vista.

159
00:11:12,152 --> 00:11:22,530
Rym: See I'm starting to think that for a long time people would use Windows and people use Linux and most people who use Linux Would use both and it wasn't that hard to do and that way you could get the best of both worlds.

160
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,803
Rym: And there were things you needed Windows for and there wasn't that much of a divergence.

161
00:11:25,863 --> 00:11:31,230
Rym: like people who use Linux primarily Still used Windows fairly often for some things like games.

162
00:11:32,175 --> 00:11:48,450
Rym: I think we're going to start seeing with Vista the beginning of a Actual schism where people use Linux don't have access to Windows at all Mm-hmm, and I wonder if that's going to segment the market or force maybe change on the behalf of Microsoft or developers.

163
00:11:48,971 --> 00:11:53,805
Scott: Well, there are really only two things that tie people to Microsoft Windows anymore.

164
00:11:53,866 --> 00:12:09,009
Scott: those two things are one PC games now the Xbox 360 is doing a lot to fix that problem and two are those proprietary applications you need at work such as my uncle with the dentist's office and the software that gets the pictures out of the x-ray.

165
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,616
Scott: or You work for the real estate agent.

166
00:12:11,636 --> 00:12:15,570
Scott: You have these special real estate software that only works on Windows or all that.

167
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:23,389
Rym: Yeah, that tab work crap had to deal with them and those things are slowly and frequently being replaced with SQL.

168
00:12:24,572 --> 00:12:27,709
Scott: You know databases with websites, you know lamp things.

169
00:12:28,212 --> 00:12:29,417
Scott: I mean that's what my company does.

170
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,711
Scott: we have a lot of those things and they just keep replacing a lot of the shit with Lamp.

171
00:12:33,193 --> 00:12:48,770
Scott: someone makes a database and web interface and it replaces that proprietary real estate Application or it replaces that x-ray application and as people do that more and more It doesn't matter what their client machines are and is more people get 360s and wheeze and whatnot.

172
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:52,308
Scott: it doesn't matter what their client computer is.

173
00:12:52,328 --> 00:13:04,930
Scott: and As the same, you know more and more frequently we see no matter what computer you have Mac Windows Linux You're on Firefox no matter what computer you have using aim, you know, no matter what computer you have using Gmail.

174
00:13:05,573 --> 00:13:08,648
Scott: so it matters a lot less what the OS is nowadays.

175
00:13:08,669 --> 00:13:18,688
Scott: and Microsoft is really gonna have to rely on things like office Which is why they're scared to shit from the of the open document format cuz that'll be the end of office also.

176
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:30,760
Scott: Yep So yeah, I'm not gonna get Vista which means any game that requires DirectX 10 will only be played by me if it's Xbox 360 and I actually buy one of those things.

177
00:13:31,081 --> 00:13:33,069
Rym: Yeah, which is very that we're considering it.

178
00:13:33,851 --> 00:13:37,602
Scott: Well, cuz $400 seemed like so much until this ps3 came along.

179
00:13:38,103 --> 00:13:38,885
Scott: it was actually up.

180
00:13:38,945 --> 00:13:40,470
Scott: then there's actually a poll.

181
00:13:40,851 --> 00:13:45,085
Scott: Not it wasn't a super scientific poll, but it was better than just a shit website poll.

182
00:13:45,506 --> 00:13:46,630
Rym: It wasn't a slashdot poll.

183
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,314
Scott: No, was it?

184
00:13:47,354 --> 00:13:49,848
Scott: No, and they asked people what system they planned on buying.

185
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:53,444
Scott: now I'm not sure what the sample was, but it was pretty big sample.

186
00:13:53,485 --> 00:13:59,105
Scott: I think it was mostly gamers and 50% of people said they're gonna have an Xbox 360 and a we.

187
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:03,598
Scott: 25% of people said we only.

188
00:14:03,618 --> 00:14:07,537
Scott: oh Yeah, that's looking good to me.

189
00:14:07,838 --> 00:14:08,420
Rym: I'm feeling it.

190
00:14:09,191 --> 00:14:19,324
Rym: No, actually, I'll note that the demographics, you know, there's been a lot of debate in our forums lately about PSP use versus DS use and the popularity they're in.

191
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:29,088
Rym: and I am there of Yeah, yeah, all right mister and and and yeah, you know, yeah like, you know, yeah.

192
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:30,338
Rym: Mm-hmm All right.

193
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:44,450
Rym: All right It's a lazy day, uh I saw about 10 DS's and two PSP's at an amazement Which is the highest ratio of PSP to DS I've ever seen at a con.

194
00:14:44,731 --> 00:14:45,675
Scott: That's more than I ever seen.

195
00:14:46,177 --> 00:15:01,089
Rym: and I guess I've noticed that yeah outside of the major Like large conventions urban centers in the Northeast and urban centers in the Midwest and you know, California the PSP does seem to be more more popular outside of those areas and less popular in those areas.

196
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:09,107
Scott: but when it comes down to straight numbers The other thing is the DS is popular where you have friends in the middle of nowhere.

197
00:15:09,127 --> 00:15:09,830
Scott: You have no friends.

198
00:15:10,051 --> 00:15:21,507
Rym: So a PSP, you know, that's where it has an advantage in the middle of no, honestly I did notice one thing interesting and every other kind I've gone to there'd always be like huge circles of people playing DS's together.

199
00:15:21,527 --> 00:15:28,304
Rym: I Came across one such circle at amazement and I thought all right I'll sit down and you know play some games with these kids and then interview them.

200
00:15:28,445 --> 00:15:29,510
Scott: little Tetris little Mario Kart.

201
00:15:29,873 --> 00:15:31,990
Rym: They were all playing one with one exception.

202
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:35,220
Rym: They were all playing like one player games on their own and two of them.

203
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,229
Rym: I think they were Animal Crossing trading, huh?

204
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:43,870
Rym: However later to make up for that because I thought oh maybe people here aren't so much into the gaming.

205
00:15:44,293 --> 00:15:49,016
Rym: While I was sitting in that tree watching the cosplay line There was this huge group of people all playing Bomberman.

206
00:15:49,317 --> 00:15:50,379
Scott: All right Bomberman.

207
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:51,060
Rym: Haha.

208
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:56,563
Rym: I Do it in the same way that we are.

209
00:15:56,583 --> 00:16:00,644
Scott: All right Yeah, I got I really don't for the crown or where they go in for the.

210
00:16:00,664 --> 00:16:02,090
Rym: I think they were playing.

211
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:07,848
Rym: They were playing random meaning every round was different and they were screaming and walking around in line and it was good.

212
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:09,814
Scott: Oh good All right.

213
00:16:09,834 --> 00:16:10,397
Scott: That's my news.

214
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:10,880
Scott: What's your news?

215
00:16:11,162 --> 00:16:11,805
Rym: Oh, yeah news.

216
00:16:12,248 --> 00:16:12,852
Rym: Mm-hmm All right.

217
00:16:12,893 --> 00:16:17,035
Rym: Well, this is real quick and this is actually from Friday But there's been a lot of talk about.

218
00:16:17,055 --> 00:16:19,201
Rym: I mean JPEG the image format.

219
00:16:19,241 --> 00:16:22,790
Rym: that is pretty much the standard on the internet for many things.

220
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,660
Scott: Oh, yeah, you don't know that.

221
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:31,116
Scott: on Friday Thursday I talked to when you weren't here talked about the windows Media photo or the window.

222
00:16:31,136 --> 00:16:31,819
Scott: There's a new.

223
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,328
Scott: Microsoft wants to make a new format to replace.

224
00:16:34,348 --> 00:16:34,730
Rym: Yeah, I did.

225
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,320
Rym: No, I didn't listen to the episode, but I read your post.

226
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,930
Rym: Okay, and in addition to that I read an article about it.

227
00:16:40,192 --> 00:16:41,305
Scott: Yeah, I talked about how?

228
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,174
Scott: JPEG puns?

229
00:16:43,696 --> 00:16:44,981
Rym: good now, I don't have to talk about it.

230
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:45,282
Rym: Yeah.

231
00:16:45,302 --> 00:16:45,824
Rym: All right.

232
00:16:45,864 --> 00:16:46,768
Rym: Yeah JPEG puns.

233
00:16:46,788 --> 00:16:56,847
Rym: Okay I It's not the greatest thing in the world, but in term I guess in terms of bang for your buck JPEG is pretty solid.

234
00:16:57,168 --> 00:17:01,943
Scott: Yeah You know Windows Media, whatever it's gonna be called photo.

235
00:17:01,963 --> 00:17:07,176
Scott: This is called Microsoft photo format Might be better technologically than JPEG.

236
00:17:07,478 --> 00:17:10,386
Rym: You know what VQF was better technologically than mp3.

237
00:17:10,465 --> 00:17:11,007
Scott: That's right.

238
00:17:11,248 --> 00:17:20,030
Rym: Haha Betamax And Yeah, but anyway the problem with JPEG which was also a problem with GIF back in the day.

239
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:20,692
Scott: You mean GIF.

240
00:17:21,153 --> 00:17:22,978
Scott: it's GIF GIF and Ubuntu.

241
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:23,921
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

242
00:17:24,161 --> 00:17:27,230
Rym: I've never met anyone who called him a GIF not ironically.

243
00:17:27,571 --> 00:17:31,090
Scott: Well, GIF is actually the correct pronunciation if you search for it on the internet.

244
00:17:31,271 --> 00:17:36,592
Rym: Oh, yeah, according to the that's like the people who say no, it's the new Linux That's the sits.

245
00:17:36,632 --> 00:17:37,194
Rym: the same deal.

246
00:17:37,254 --> 00:17:39,080
Rym: No one in the real world says GIF.

247
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:43,113
Scott: Yeah, but GIF is the technical correct pronunciation You know, it's.

248
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:45,703
Rym: I find it interesting that when it comes to GIF versus GIF.

249
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:57,770
Rym: It's been my experience that super super nerds not to disparage anyone out there and People who are not technological at all are the primary people who say GIF as opposed to GIF.

250
00:17:58,152 --> 00:17:58,493
Scott: You know what?

251
00:17:58,534 --> 00:18:00,403
Scott: GIF is a peanut butter brand.

252
00:18:00,665 --> 00:18:01,348
Scott: That's what GIF is.

253
00:18:02,671 --> 00:18:05,278
Rym: GIF is some popcorn, you know, jiffy puff.

254
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:06,221
Rym: Yep.

255
00:18:06,381 --> 00:18:06,581
Scott: Yep.

256
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,690
Scott: GIF doesn't mean anything except image format.

257
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:17,814
Rym: Therefore if they whoever I get very simple you realize that GIF stands for a graphical or graphics interchange format Ga graphic.

258
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:24,534
Rym: Yeah, it's a hard G. You don't alter the pronunciation of a letter in an acronym Woohoo.

259
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:28,942
Rym: Well, I am straight And while we're at it is garymandering you pig fuckers.

260
00:18:29,023 --> 00:18:34,544
Scott: and here it comes everyone with their Counter-examples of where do we do it the wrong way?

261
00:18:34,684 --> 00:18:35,447
Rym: Yeah, which is fine.

262
00:18:35,588 --> 00:18:37,272
Scott: That's fine Nothing.

263
00:18:37,292 --> 00:18:39,098
Scott: there's nothing wrong with being a hypocrite.

264
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:42,572
Scott: if you see if you accept it who booed - boo boo Do.

265
00:18:42,713 --> 00:18:45,310
Rym: yeah from now on we're gonna call it GNU Linux every time.

266
00:18:47,511 --> 00:18:54,030
Rym: No, sorry GNU Linux up yep, yep, because his name is Linus or I've heard I've heard him say it because I saw it.

267
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,375
Rym: It was like Linux once.

268
00:18:55,756 --> 00:18:56,820
Scott: Yeah, I'm not sure we're gonna.

269
00:18:57,161 --> 00:18:57,522
Scott: that's the thing.

270
00:18:57,563 --> 00:19:01,598
Scott: is every interview with with Linus Torvalds I've ever heard I've never heard one.

271
00:19:01,658 --> 00:19:02,762
Scott: I've always read one.

272
00:19:02,903 --> 00:19:04,730
Scott: Yeah, I've never heard him talk ever.

273
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:09,130
Rym: I heard one once but I'm not sure if it was him or someone paraphrasing because it was a short bit.

274
00:19:09,813 --> 00:19:13,890
Scott: We got to get some audio of him saying and whoever he says it is the correct way.

275
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:14,352
Scott: You know what?

276
00:19:14,432 --> 00:19:15,337
Scott: I might not accept it.

277
00:19:15,377 --> 00:19:20,248
Scott: I might still say gif even though I know gif is correct But I just want to hear it to know.

278
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:28,530
Rym: Anyway, there's there were patent concerns because people own the rights to gift back then and there are people who have patents that cover stuff.

279
00:19:28,571 --> 00:19:34,563
Rym: That's in JPEG One of the major one of those patents that this company looks like they're trying to use.

280
00:19:34,623 --> 00:19:39,909
Rym: this to make people pay for the fact That they use JPEG was totally thrown out by the patent office.

281
00:19:40,231 --> 00:19:44,270
Rym: Haha, so I believe the company's name was faux gents and they had a patent that covered JPEG.

282
00:19:44,431 --> 00:19:47,390
Scott: Are they just one of those patent companies or that actually an image company?

283
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,272
Rym: Well, the reason.

284
00:19:48,593 --> 00:20:00,330
Rym: I think this will answer that the reason it was thrown out is that prior art existed, which is fine and They might not have thrown it out right away or they might have allowed them to amend it or something.

285
00:20:01,072 --> 00:20:06,470
Rym: But it was shown that they were fully aware of that prior art and chose not to disclose it to the patent office.

286
00:20:07,793 --> 00:20:10,707
Rym: Yeah, there is no chance that they were not up to something.

287
00:20:10,747 --> 00:20:11,049
Rym: shady.

288
00:20:13,031 --> 00:20:18,846
Rym: See the patent office is good when someone like points out to them that a patent is bad and there's money involved because then they'll Deal with it.

289
00:20:19,211 --> 00:20:29,941
Scott: The problem is is that there's so many things that are patented that there isn't a wide enough body of knowledge at The patent office to know about every single patent.

290
00:20:29,982 --> 00:20:33,976
Scott: So when they get a patent about Image file formats.

291
00:20:34,016 --> 00:20:36,664
Scott: There isn't an image file format expert at the patent office.

292
00:20:36,684 --> 00:20:37,366
Scott: So they don't know.

293
00:20:37,386 --> 00:20:38,570
Scott: Yeah, they just say yes.

294
00:20:39,294 --> 00:20:44,790
Rym: Now they have a solution to this I talked about in the news a while ago But real briefly spent for anyone who didn't who didn't catch that episode.

295
00:20:45,591 --> 00:20:48,842
Rym: They've got an idea to kind of have an open source.

296
00:20:49,384 --> 00:20:49,685
Rym: they call it.

297
00:20:49,705 --> 00:20:51,070
Rym: they call it this open something initiative.

298
00:20:51,130 --> 00:21:12,250
Rym: I forget exactly the details, but they want to have pending patents and patents that exist available on the website and Have bounties for experts with free time like, you know us when we sit around bored to read over patents that are in our field of expertise and Just point out prior art problems or here's why this patent is stupid or here's why this patent should be invalidated.

299
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:22,281
Scott: See if they would have set that up when I was in college I would have spent my time going over there finding bogus patents and then eventually, you know They'd probably realize hey this guy like did this a thousand times.

300
00:21:22,522 --> 00:21:25,772
Scott: Yeah, I'd be a patent clerk right now instead of Nothing.

301
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,417
Rym: Yeah Einstein was a patent clerk.

302
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:29,983
Scott: He was that he was very good playing.

303
00:21:30,364 --> 00:21:48,030
Rym: I call this Johnson's theory of relativity Yeah, but in terms of patents, I mean I think you all know my opinions on the curtain patent system Especially considering that my former company is still trying to get a patent for me on something that I did for them.

304
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:51,302
Rym: That is basically 15 or 20 lines of bash scripting.

305
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:53,490
Scott: I got one thing to say about the patent system.

306
00:21:54,191 --> 00:21:56,668
Scott: It's no worse than the copyright system.

307
00:21:59,591 --> 00:22:14,606
Rym: You know what I would submit that the patent system as it is is more damaging to the economy and to the betterment and advancement of humankind than copyright is because Violating copyright has only actually hurt in terms of people who violate it get caught.

308
00:22:15,087 --> 00:22:27,790
Rym: very few people mean when when property rights that are intellectual as opposed to real or involving something scientific are Violated the it's very hard to actually gauge how many losses there are.

309
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:32,030
Rym: I mean, how can you say how many copies of a CD would have sold if you couldn't get it free?

310
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:32,782
Rym: There's no way to know.

311
00:22:33,692 --> 00:22:43,235
Rym: With patents people are prevented from taking a thing that is known how to make and making it better or manufacturing it or Advancing it in any way.

312
00:22:43,255 --> 00:22:44,498
Scott: That's correct.

313
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,290
Rym: I mean, they're not technically prevented, but you're allowed to advance it.

314
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,475
Scott: You're just not allowed to.

315
00:22:49,616 --> 00:22:52,570
Rym: well, even if you advance it, you still have to pay license fees for the original thing.

316
00:22:52,842 --> 00:22:56,849
Scott: Yeah Yeah As long as you don't utilize the original within a certain amount of time.

317
00:22:57,311 --> 00:22:58,737
Scott: Good thing is though that patent.

318
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:02,050
Scott: the term of a patent is rather short relative to a copyright.

319
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,119
Scott: It doesn't take long for the patent to run out.

320
00:23:04,501 --> 00:23:05,846
Scott: So everyone can make it for free.

321
00:23:06,027 --> 00:23:06,690
Rym: It's still too long.

322
00:23:06,812 --> 00:23:07,690
Scott: It is still too long.

323
00:23:07,771 --> 00:23:09,452
Scott: It should be a year You know.

324
00:23:09,592 --> 00:23:15,850
Scott: as technology progresses faster and faster the term should get shorter and shorter or if we had money to pay the patent office.

325
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:27,878
Rym: People properly make it an indeterminate sum with a minimum and a maximum and then the patent office decides how long the patent should be based on the merits of the invention and the Economic and scientific situation at the time.

326
00:23:28,419 --> 00:23:40,373
Scott: Yeah, if you look at something like the washing machine The washing machine hasn't really changed technologically rather long time, you know, and it's pretty economically Important.

327
00:23:40,915 --> 00:23:45,610
Scott: I mean there's a big business around washing machine making and you know, it's still the same business.

328
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,855
Scott: It was a bunch of years ago.

329
00:23:46,935 --> 00:23:52,945
Scott: So that could be a rather long patent, but something like I don't know That's something that should be a long patent though by long.

330
00:23:52,985 --> 00:24:06,678
Scott: I mean five years by long, I mean the limit they have now not 50 years or 100 years, but something like An image file format or Something that's gonna you know needs to change really quickly.

331
00:24:06,698 --> 00:24:08,384
Scott: Let me like mp3 files.

332
00:24:08,444 --> 00:24:09,467
Scott: that patent should last.

333
00:24:09,828 --> 00:24:10,109
Scott: I don't know.

334
00:24:10,129 --> 00:24:12,989
Scott: week You know you get the idea.

335
00:24:13,331 --> 00:24:22,945
Rym: Yeah, I mean in the very least if they were just if they could look at the patents and decide which ones are actually patentable as opposed to which ones aren't and really do that instead of just kind of rubber

336
00:24:22,965 --> 00:24:26,402
Scott: and also you shouldn't be able to Patent something without physically having it.

337
00:24:26,442 --> 00:24:27,568
Scott: none of this patenting.

338
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,520
Scott: You know perpetual motion machine business that everyone does.

339
00:24:31,801 --> 00:24:37,621
Scott: if you can't produce it physically right now You can't patent it or at least that's what Scott says.

340
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:39,750
Rym: I say you could if you can show that it can be done.

341
00:24:39,931 --> 00:24:40,476
Scott: Yeah, okay.

342
00:24:40,496 --> 00:24:41,849
Scott: You don't actually have to do it.

343
00:24:42,131 --> 00:24:43,999
Scott: It just has to be able to be done.

344
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:55,530
Scott: because let's say I invented a machine in you know mechanical desktop Which is a program kind of like CAD that lets you draw machines and actually make the machines work on the computer.

345
00:24:56,275 --> 00:25:03,519
Scott: If I can make it in mechanical desktop and You know there exist Manufacturing processes to create the device.

346
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,290
Scott: I just don't have the five million dollars required to create the machine.

347
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,237
Scott: I should still be able to patent it.

348
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:12,690
Scott: It just has to be able to be made right now.

349
00:25:13,191 --> 00:25:22,750
Scott: So let's say I make a machine on the computer, and I design it and it requires you know Some metal that we can't actually produce.

350
00:25:23,593 --> 00:25:27,390
Scott: Then that doesn't count because we can't actually produce it no matter how much money we have.

351
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:30,900
Rym: But as soon as we I'm going to patent having an adamantium skeleton.

352
00:25:31,121 --> 00:25:31,702
Scott: exactly.

353
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:32,525
Scott: you can't do that.

354
00:25:32,645 --> 00:25:34,290
Scott: you can patent having an iron skeleton.

355
00:25:36,231 --> 00:25:37,937
Scott: Yeah, I don't know why you'd want to.

356
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:43,930
Rym: well the other really ass thing about the patent system Is that say Scott and I are both you know?

357
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:51,982
Rym: We're rivals and we're working on patents for I don't know magic light bulb thingy, and we're both like working on the invention Medicine.

358
00:25:52,203 --> 00:26:00,105
Rym: now say I Finish like I come up with it, and I make it work But I don't know five minutes before Scott does.

359
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,870
Rym: Scott lives in California I live in New York and I mind works.

360
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:07,050
Rym: I'm done And I run out the door to the patent office and Scott finishes his five minutes later.

361
00:26:07,131 --> 00:26:08,450
Rym: He runs out to the door to the patent office.

362
00:26:08,871 --> 00:26:10,638
Rym: But I got to the patent office first.

363
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:11,942
Rym: I get the patent.

364
00:26:11,962 --> 00:26:16,399
Rym: he gets nothing is absolutely no rights and in fact It is illegal for him to continue doing what he just did.

365
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:17,141
Scott: yep.

366
00:26:17,804 --> 00:26:18,486
Rym: That is crap.

367
00:26:18,647 --> 00:26:19,450
Scott: It is total crap.

368
00:26:20,331 --> 00:26:25,399
Rym: In the very least there should be a system of if people discuss develop something independently Then they should be able to.

369
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:26,790
Scott: there needs to be a window.

370
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:35,830
Scott: So if someone comes up with something right and submits it to the patent office Because the way patents work is once a patent is is going they show it to everyone.

371
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,739
Scott: It's not like copyright where you keep it secret.

372
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:40,472
Scott: a patent is shown to the world You know.

373
00:26:41,014 --> 00:26:44,910
Scott: so if I patent some machine you can go to the website and get the design for that machine.

374
00:26:44,991 --> 00:26:50,350
Scott: You can go to the patent office and say hey Can I look at this patent and they'll show you the complete plans to my patented machine?

375
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,150
Scott: Let us show it to you.

376
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:51,713
Rym: It's the exact.

377
00:26:51,733 --> 00:26:55,370
Rym: I mean the two ways to protect something in the corporate world are patents and trade secrets.

378
00:26:55,731 --> 00:26:57,941
Rym: No patent is what Scott just said a trade secret.

379
00:26:58,323 --> 00:27:01,717
Rym: you choose not to patent it meaning It's not protected in any way.

380
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:08,270
Rym: and if someone figures it out or steals it from you They can use it with just as much rights as you have, but you're keeping it secret.

381
00:27:08,371 --> 00:27:11,866
Scott: And if anyone steals the secret with corporate espionage That's criminal.

382
00:27:12,432 --> 00:27:15,405
Scott: So they have to come up with it on their own or they can steal it.

383
00:27:15,446 --> 00:27:19,422
Rym: if they do it in certain ways I mean you know legal loopholes and all that stuff or they pay you for it.

384
00:27:19,703 --> 00:27:28,714
Scott: Yeah, yeah, but anyway What they should do is when you submit a patent it should stay secret for some period of time if anyone else is known To be working.

385
00:27:29,035 --> 00:27:32,070
Scott: you know especially if anyone else is known to be working on similar things.

386
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:45,750
Scott: Or maybe you can tell the patent office Hey I'm working on something kind of like this and if a bunch of people say they're doing that and Then they get all the submissions within a certain window of time then you know you get a part of all the same patent.

387
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:49,148
Scott: They make a big one big patent and you all share it or something like that.

388
00:27:49,791 --> 00:28:00,769
Rym: But I guess my main beef is that the Constitution and the way the patent system was originally set up Was that and copyright too was that is supposed to be to foster innovation and generally work toward the common good?

389
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:06,370
Scott: Mm-hmm it says that right in the Constitution and in fact under the powers of Congress enumerated.

390
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:09,460
Rym: I really don't care how the patent system is set up.

391
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:12,129
Rym: all I care about is that at least the people who?

392
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:27,461
Rym: Enacted or who run it or who decide how it is done if they would just think to themselves or at least Say that what they're doing they think it's for the common good or try to do things to for the common good as opposed to Just doing it for money or maintaining the status quo mm-hmm.

393
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:30,229
Rym: I give someone credit if they try and fail than if they never try.

394
00:28:31,133 --> 00:28:43,019
Scott: Usually usually I think the argument that I've made before is that if This very day we completely eliminated patents and copyrights It wouldn't hinder the fostering of innovation.

395
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:49,217
Scott: really that much people are innovating of their own will without Copyrights or patents at all.

396
00:28:49,498 --> 00:28:49,599
Rym: well.

397
00:28:49,639 --> 00:28:52,550
Rym: It's like the people who don't understand how open-source software can exist.

398
00:28:52,951 --> 00:28:55,097
Rym: I only bring it up because I came up over the weekend.

399
00:28:55,118 --> 00:28:56,261
Scott: Oh really.

400
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:56,803
Rym: Yeah.

401
00:28:56,823 --> 00:28:57,625
Scott: Tell me about that.

402
00:28:57,866 --> 00:28:59,230
Rym: Yeah, it's kind of relevant.

403
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:02,803
Rym: I'll talk about it, and I haven't had a. he works for some people and basically they.

404
00:29:03,425 --> 00:29:08,629
Rym: he was explaining to someone Open-source free software, and how it's free and she didn't believe him.

405
00:29:09,093 --> 00:29:15,002
Rym: She didn't believe that people would actually make Things without compensation simply be for the joy of it.

406
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:16,489
Scott: a lot of old people don't believe it.

407
00:29:17,053 --> 00:29:17,599
Scott: They they like.

408
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:18,550
Scott: why would you do that?

409
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:26,850
Scott: We're like because we're not fucking evil fucks who care about only money in ourselves And we like to share just like you told us on Sesame Street.

410
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:28,198
Rym: No in fact you know what we are.

411
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,889
Rym: we're my thing of the day bitch.

412
00:29:38,696 --> 00:29:46,020
Rym: So with my unsubtle segue you probably all remember, I'm the juggernaut comma bitch Which was my thing of the day a while ago?

413
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,799
Rym: I'm the juggernaut bitch you shoot with my pimp cane.

414
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:59,828
Rym: Yeah, well it's back, and I'm sure you might have seen this in the news, but if not I Went to see probably the worst movie.

415
00:29:59,989 --> 00:30:02,276
Rym: I have ever sat through in a theater.

416
00:30:02,657 --> 00:30:03,118
Rym: x-men 3 okay.

417
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,100
Scott: So it's not the worst movie ever seen it's just the worst you've sat all the way through in the theater.

418
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:13,912
Rym: Yeah, I mean I've walked out of movies before I've turned movies off that I sat all the way through Clifford But that wasn't in a theater.

419
00:30:13,952 --> 00:30:15,522
Rym: that was in my house Mm-hmm.

420
00:30:15,944 --> 00:30:18,454
Rym: this movie was asked for reasons that I won't get into.

421
00:30:18,515 --> 00:30:22,109
Rym: maybe we'll do a show on Comic book movies someday, maybe.

422
00:30:22,149 --> 00:30:23,534
Scott: yeah be pretty good in fact.

423
00:30:23,594 --> 00:30:23,915
Scott: I will.

424
00:30:23,976 --> 00:30:25,682
Scott: I haven't seen many of them I've seen.

425
00:30:25,702 --> 00:30:29,700
Scott: I saw the first x-men and didn't know why everyone else liked it a lot more than I did.

426
00:30:30,421 --> 00:30:32,488
Scott: I saw hellboy, which is kind of normal ish.

427
00:30:32,629 --> 00:30:33,311
Rym: We saw V.

428
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,720
Scott: V was a. it was probably the best one.

429
00:30:36,322 --> 00:30:36,704
Rym: You know what.

430
00:30:36,764 --> 00:30:38,973
Rym: well I'll put in the Netflix queue, and I'll put him to the top.

431
00:30:39,274 --> 00:30:41,303
Rym: all the comic book movies We haven't seen.

432
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,612
Scott: you have to see some of the old Superman movies.

433
00:30:43,692 --> 00:30:44,495
Rym: I've seen some of them.

434
00:30:44,917 --> 00:30:47,570
Scott: Yeah You didn't see enough of them.

435
00:30:47,711 --> 00:30:47,852
Rym: No.

436
00:30:47,872 --> 00:30:48,236
Rym: I haven't.

437
00:30:48,357 --> 00:30:49,625
Rym: yeah I'll put all those.

438
00:30:49,645 --> 00:30:52,439
Rym: I haven't seen enough of them either, and then we'll do a show on that.

439
00:30:53,482 --> 00:30:57,160
Scott: If anyone out there really all said to see our isn't the second spider-man movie supposed to be good?

440
00:30:57,361 --> 00:30:57,783
Scott: Yeah, it is.

441
00:30:57,843 --> 00:30:58,909
Scott: the first one was good.

442
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:00,336
Scott: I didn't see the second one.

443
00:31:00,376 --> 00:31:01,020
Scott: is there a third one?

444
00:31:01,301 --> 00:31:01,964
Rym: I don't know.

445
00:31:01,984 --> 00:31:04,715
Rym: I'm out of the movie loop, but x-men 3 is terrible.

446
00:31:04,756 --> 00:31:05,519
Rym: Don't go see it.

447
00:31:06,101 --> 00:31:08,132
Scott: They too late they already went to see it.

448
00:31:08,453 --> 00:31:11,348
Rym: Well if you didn't go to see it yet I'm going to spoil it right now.

449
00:31:11,931 --> 00:31:13,820
Rym: spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler.

450
00:31:13,881 --> 00:31:18,572
Rym: I was gonna loan gunman it But I decided not to because we do have some new listeners who don't realize how.

451
00:31:19,033 --> 00:31:21,419
Rym: I don't know assholes we are sometimes Okay.

452
00:31:22,182 --> 00:31:29,659
Rym: Jean Grey is killed by Wolverine but she tries to have sex with him and they kill Scott Summers in the very beginning of the movie and just for no reason.

453
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,639
Rym: and They kill Professor X and they take away Magneto's powers and the movies just dumb yeah.

454
00:31:35,781 --> 00:31:44,360
Scott: But anyway, I just want to say anyone out there if you have never read x-men comics So you haven't read x-men comics contain?

455
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:49,339
Scott: You know old ones containing the real x-men stories because modern x-men comics aren't the real deal.

456
00:31:50,184 --> 00:31:55,708
Scott: Go to like borders and they have these big black books And they say essential x-men on the side of them.

457
00:31:56,009 --> 00:31:57,794
Scott: not essential uncanny x-men.

458
00:31:58,175 --> 00:32:01,186
Scott: not essential x-men classic Just essential x-men.

459
00:32:01,788 --> 00:32:07,173
Scott: the second volume of that is 10 bucks Just 10 bucks possibly even less than 10 bucks.

460
00:32:07,937 --> 00:32:08,500
Scott: It's huge.

461
00:32:08,782 --> 00:32:14,436
Scott: It's got like a hajillion comics in it And it contains the real x-men stories that you need to read.

462
00:32:14,536 --> 00:32:18,742
Scott: once you read those Go back and watch these movies a little bit You know what.

463
00:32:18,762 --> 00:32:21,975
Rym: if you want to see the best x-men that's in my opinion ever really been done.

464
00:32:21,995 --> 00:32:24,145
Rym: check out the Fox cartoon Fox Cartoon rules.

465
00:32:24,225 --> 00:32:25,954
Rym: that was x-men as far as I'm concerned.

466
00:32:26,115 --> 00:32:35,320
Scott: as far as I'm concerned Because yeah the x-men that I read it was the x-men of the early 90s Which a lot of people consider to be the worst x-men, but that was when I was a kid.

467
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,319
Scott: So that's what I you know think is the real deal.

468
00:32:38,205 --> 00:32:42,010
Rym: but anyway Obviously while it is Monday, and it is science and tech day.

469
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,094
Rym: We were just kind of rambling.

470
00:32:43,697 --> 00:32:45,927
Scott: yay rambling Oh my thing of the day.

471
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:47,213
Rym: I didn't even do my thing of the day.

472
00:32:47,554 --> 00:32:49,343
Rym: Oh, I didn't say anything yet I just said okay.

473
00:32:49,423 --> 00:32:49,905
Rym: Okay.

474
00:32:49,925 --> 00:32:50,548
Scott: We'll finish it up.

475
00:32:50,708 --> 00:32:51,351
Rym: so in this movie.

476
00:32:51,472 --> 00:32:55,799
Rym: the juggernaut is in it and You've all seen my on the juggernaut bitch video.

477
00:32:57,101 --> 00:33:00,490
Rym: In the movie the juggernaut says the line.

478
00:33:01,092 --> 00:33:04,060
Rym: don't you know who I am I'm the juggernaut bitch.

479
00:33:04,902 --> 00:33:17,340
Rym: Awesome, I'm reasonably certain that the scene where the juggernaut says this was Added into the movie because of the on the juggernaut bitch movie that has been out on the internet.

480
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:26,119
Rym: I'm very certain that it was not the other way around because the people who made that video There's no way they could have known that that line was in the movie.

481
00:33:27,221 --> 00:33:31,820
Scott: I don't think there was a way they knew either unless the video was made by someone who works on the movie.

482
00:33:32,781 --> 00:33:40,490
Rym: Yeah, I'm just because the whole the x-men movie was really there were so many things they threw in that were just for super nerds Like those are the Morlocks aren't they?

483
00:33:40,973 --> 00:33:42,540
Rym: yeah, but they don't even say anything about that.

484
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,283
Rym: They're just there.

485
00:33:43,303 --> 00:33:46,680
Scott: it seems like a lot of the comic book movies.

486
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:51,520
Scott: They want to bring in the mass populace, but they don't want to alienate the nerds.

487
00:33:51,902 --> 00:34:06,697
Scott: So they take all the nerdy stuff and they put it in the background Where the nerds go ooh and ah and get crazy over it and in the foreground is just the normal stuff that the normal people Can get and without being alienated and scared away by scary nerdy things,

488
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:11,920
Rym: but yeah I linked to the clip from the x-men movie of the juggernaut saying his line

489
00:34:12,563 --> 00:34:12,864
Scott: Awesome,

490
00:34:13,367 --> 00:34:14,634
Rym: that's pretty much the only now.

491
00:34:14,654 --> 00:34:18,474
Rym: the best part was we're in the theater you know me Evan and Nury and we're watching this after the con.

492
00:34:18,494 --> 00:34:21,623
Rym: so we're all exhausted and The movie was asked.

493
00:34:21,664 --> 00:34:25,920
Rym: we're just sitting there periodically looking at each other when something stupid happens like what?

494
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:34,733
Rym: But then when the juggernaut said that line We exploded laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing anyone else.

495
00:34:35,033 --> 00:34:37,300
Rym: no awesome the entire theater.

496
00:34:37,641 --> 00:34:38,706
Rym: Everyone turned around.

497
00:34:38,726 --> 00:34:39,914
Rym: they were looking at us with this.

498
00:34:40,094 --> 00:34:40,940
Rym: What the fuck?

499
00:34:42,161 --> 00:34:43,840
Scott: What have not been on to Internet?

500
00:34:45,181 --> 00:34:48,840
Rym: I don't think I think we were the only three people in the theater at any idea why that was funny.

501
00:34:49,822 --> 00:34:50,507
Scott: That's awesome.

502
00:34:51,112 --> 00:34:59,980
Scott: Okay, so I Always go for the Nintendo commercials and whenever I can and here is yet another one, but this isn't advertising Nintendo.

503
00:35:00,161 --> 00:35:01,908
Scott: Well, I guess it kinda is indirectly.

504
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:03,555
Scott: This is an advertisement.

505
00:35:03,575 --> 00:35:04,880
Scott: so for some furikake.

506
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:07,934
Scott: Furikake is some sort of rice topping.

507
00:35:07,954 --> 00:35:09,280
Scott: you put it on rice.

508
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:12,708
Scott: No, it's furikake anyway.

509
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:32,605
Scott: This is a food ad for some brand of furikake in Japan and the ad features animated Mario And it's a pretty funny advertisement because apparently it's not mushrooms, but furikake that makes Mario grow big And the guy.

510
00:35:32,685 --> 00:35:36,380
Scott: it's funny when the Japanese guy says super Mario brothers furikake.

511
00:35:37,362 --> 00:35:38,007
Scott: It's hilarious.

512
00:35:38,933 --> 00:35:39,840
Rym: I gotta keep resisting.

513
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,780
Rym: I keep like wanting to talk about the convention, but I'm gonna try to save that for my actual coverage on Wednesday.

514
00:35:45,041 --> 00:35:45,302
Scott: All right.

515
00:35:45,362 --> 00:35:47,430
Scott: Well, we don't have a tech topic today.

516
00:35:47,491 --> 00:35:47,872
Scott: Sorry.

517
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:48,334
Scott: You know what?

518
00:35:48,475 --> 00:35:49,820

Scott: I'm sure now he's going to listen to this and tell me that's right.

534
00:36:28,181 --> 00:36:36,440
Scott: Yeah, anyway, if you want to hear me in my terrible logitech headset audio quality Of course, his audio quality is great.

535
00:36:36,601 --> 00:36:39,371

547
00:37:34,902 --> 00:37:40,580
Scott: Yep, pretty much as soon as you left this insane heat and humidity set in right behind you.

548
00:37:40,861 --> 00:37:46,556
Rym: Yeah, I mean I came home and I walked into the house and I said wow and I immediately put my air conditioner in the window.

Scott: Yeah, yeah, my screen was is downstairs in the under the stairs room.

555
00:38:11,925 --> 00:38:13,350
Rym: so I have a towel stuck in there now.

Rym: Mm-hmm.

560
00:38:18,801 --> 00:38:19,805
Scott: So air conditioners.

561
00:38:20,026 --> 00:38:21,874
Scott: you everyone should have an air conditioner.

562
00:38:21,934 --> 00:38:24,045
Scott: unless you live somewhere awesome We're.

563
00:38:24,126 --> 00:38:25,899
Scott: no wait somewhere sucky cuz it's cold.

564
00:38:26,621 --> 00:38:29,080
Rym: Honestly, I don't really like to use air conditioners much.

565
00:38:29,201 --> 00:38:29,865
Rym: I'd rather get the.

566
00:38:29,885 --> 00:38:32,380
Rym: you know, the nice smells outside of the nice breeze at night.

567
00:38:32,841 --> 00:38:37,616
Rym: I really only use an air conditioner if it's hot and humid and I'm trying to sleep.

568
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,964
Rym: I Don't mind just hot humid.

569
00:38:40,105 --> 00:38:41,592
Rym: I don't even use the air conditioner.

570
00:38:41,612 --> 00:38:43,400
Rym: my car broke and I could have fixed it.

571
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:43,984
Rym: It would have been cheap.

572
00:38:44,024 --> 00:38:49,959
Scott: I just never bothered because I don't care to be honest I put the air conditioner in my room this weekend more for the computers than for me.

573
00:38:50,382 --> 00:38:53,199
Rym: Yeah, your room is basically our data center right now.

574
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:59,434
Scott: I mean I was a little bit hot but I wasn't too, you know A fan would have done just fine at one point.

575
00:38:59,494 --> 00:39:00,720
Scott: It got a little cooler outside.

576
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:06,407
Scott: I opened the window I was just fine, but the computer was getting pissed off Really pissed off.

577
00:39:06,668 --> 00:39:07,311
Scott: So I'm like fine.

578
00:39:07,331 --> 00:39:08,617
Scott: I'll put the damn air conditioner in.

579
00:39:08,858 --> 00:39:09,180
Rym: you know what?

580
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:12,453
Rym: Yeah, just think about when we started the podcast so long ago.

581
00:39:12,815 --> 00:39:13,920
Rym: that wasn't during the heat.

582
00:39:14,562 --> 00:39:19,438
Rym: So the listeners have never heard the alarm on my computer that goes off when it starts overheating.

583
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:24,995
Scott: Oh You know if that alarm goes off, the only thing we can do is restart your computer and wait.

584
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:27,383
Rym: so don't know I already fixed that.

585
00:39:28,246 --> 00:39:30,292
Rym: I set the threshold significantly higher.

586
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:32,218
Rym: All right, and the alarm stopped going off.

587
00:39:32,298 --> 00:39:37,879
Rym: That's right Just like I solved the loud case fan problem by unplugging the case fan.

588
00:39:39,481 --> 00:39:44,500
Rym: Luckily my computer's so old and slow it hasn't complained much and it's really not overheating.

589
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:48,400
Scott: Well, I don't think it's gonna be a problem since you have the side of the case open and the air conditioning on.

590
00:39:48,941 --> 00:39:50,686
Rym: Yeah, yeah, though.

591
00:39:50,706 --> 00:40:03,540
Scott: I mean many a time I'd be playing counter-strike at RIT where we didn't have air conditioning and suddenly It's really when you try to use the video card, but remember your GeForce 2 isn't in there anymore.

592
00:40:03,721 --> 00:40:04,947
Rym: Yeah, because it exploded.

593
00:40:05,228 --> 00:40:05,710
Rym: now I got.

594
00:40:05,871 --> 00:40:07,620
Scott: that's gonna help out a lot with the heat problem.

595
00:40:07,881 --> 00:40:12,819
Rym: Yeah, cuz I've noticed I only ever had heat problems when I played games and the CPU and the video card were both maxed out.

596
00:40:13,081 --> 00:40:13,342
Scott: Yep.

597
00:40:13,463 --> 00:40:16,240
Scott: Now you have a shitty TNT - and there that doesn't make heat.

598
00:40:16,561 --> 00:40:21,078
Rym: Yeah, your TNT - actually which was one hell of a piece of equipment back in the day.

599
00:40:21,098 --> 00:40:22,222
Scott: Oh, man Was that thing?

600
00:40:22,342 --> 00:40:22,663
Scott: Awesome.

601
00:40:23,185 --> 00:40:23,987
Scott: It's still awesome.

602
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:25,010
Scott: I can play.

603
00:40:25,051 --> 00:40:27,920
Scott: you can play half-life 1 and lesser games with it.

604
00:40:28,381 --> 00:40:33,140
Rym: Yep, I currently can't get the 3d to work in Linux, but that's partly because I didn't try.

605
00:40:33,922 --> 00:40:35,854
Rym: And there's something funky with the Nvidia driver.

606
00:40:35,894 --> 00:40:41,020
Rym: I'm using currently Yeah, because I had to use a special Nvidia driver to make my GeForce 2 GTS work.

607
00:40:41,501 --> 00:40:50,776
Scott: So my parents have the onboard video card in their computer and it has a little problem I think because these green dots all over the screen and it doesn't matter what monitor you use.

608
00:40:50,796 --> 00:40:55,020
Scott: There's still green dots So I think I'm gonna buy them an AGP card to go in the slot.

609
00:40:55,401 --> 00:40:57,749
Rym: I am the GeForce 4 that we got downstairs.

610
00:40:57,769 --> 00:40:59,917
Scott: that thing has some GeForce 4s for 25 bucks.

611
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,435
Scott: I'm thinking about buying two or three of them.

612
00:41:02,476 --> 00:41:02,859
Scott: What do you think?

613
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,426
Rym: Yeah, I'll probably go in on that.

614
00:41:04,446 --> 00:41:06,252
Rym: It's good to have a couple video cards laying around.

615
00:41:06,272 --> 00:41:07,256
Scott: Yeah, they're $25 AGP video cards.

616
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,403
Scott: I think we should buy a couple.

617
00:41:09,744 --> 00:41:09,985
Rym: Hmm.

618
00:41:10,887 --> 00:41:15,060
Rym: We got to buy more network cable - yeah, I'll get on that at some point.

619
00:41:17,288 --> 00:41:19,340
Rym: Yeah, so anyway, we're gonna wrap it up today.

620
00:41:19,521 --> 00:41:24,800
Rym: Normally, the show is a little more structured, but we at least once or twice a month have a cop-out day.

621
00:41:25,601 --> 00:41:29,177
Scott: Yeah, you try doing a podcast four nights a week and never copping out.

622
00:41:29,338 --> 00:41:30,803
Scott: and yeah Try to you.

623
00:41:31,566 --> 00:41:38,018
Scott: even every webcomic does some sketch day even penny arcade and they only do three nights You know with the penny arcade comics.

624
00:41:38,862 --> 00:41:41,730
Scott: So imagine doing four once in a while.

625
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:44,076
Scott: You got to just not do a real episode.

626
00:41:44,096 --> 00:41:44,417
Scott: You're glad.

627
00:41:44,437 --> 00:41:45,440
Scott: you should be glad we do anything.

628
00:41:45,761 --> 00:41:52,060
Rym: Yeah, I mean we debated early on like we considered dropping back early on to three shows a week instead of four.

629
00:41:52,723 --> 00:41:54,231
Scott: Yeah, it's Memorial Day.

630
00:41:54,251 --> 00:41:55,980
Rym: Yeah, we don't stop for anything.

631
00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:05,790
Rym: 117 times about an hour worth of original internet content Plus all the extra episodes that you'll never hear.

632
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:11,310
Scott: Yeah, a lot of those five day a week podcasts They don't actually do full hours of podcasting.

633
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:12,213
Scott: They do crap.

634
00:42:12,314 --> 00:42:13,879
Scott: They do like a minute show or something.

635
00:42:14,662 --> 00:42:18,195
Rym: Yeah, we're mainly show rationalizing the fact that we do all this work for all of you.

636
00:42:18,516 --> 00:42:19,942
Rym: Yeah, it's fun We like it.

637
00:42:19,982 --> 00:42:22,892
Rym: We wouldn't be doing if we didn't like it and see what else.

638
00:42:23,313 --> 00:42:28,752
Rym: we're also padding out this episode a little bit So we're kind of just drawing on anything we can think of.

639
00:42:28,873 --> 00:42:29,796
Scott: Yep on Saturday.

640
00:42:29,856 --> 00:42:30,940
Scott: I played board games all day.

641
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,145
Scott: I could talk about that on Tuesday.

642
00:42:32,165 --> 00:42:33,470
Scott: Yep, Wednesday.

643
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:44,790
Scott: I will talk about an amazement on Sunday and today I was at my parents house and I ate food hung out Set someone up with DSL on Thursday.

644
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:46,495
Rym: I'd like to talk about the airline industry.

645
00:42:46,515 --> 00:42:48,060
Scott: Do you want to talk about airlines?

646
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:51,278
Rym: Yes, I want to talk about airlines because I didn't talk about it today.

647
00:42:51,298 --> 00:42:57,100
Rym: and God damn as I have I never in my life flown anywhere without complications.

648
00:42:57,321 --> 00:43:00,433
Scott: God damn if I never had a complication while flying.

649
00:43:00,493 --> 00:43:01,457
Rym: cuz you fly jet blue.

650
00:43:01,477 --> 00:43:02,962
Rym: Yep Yeah, you know what.

651
00:43:02,982 --> 00:43:04,347
Rym: jet blue doesn't go to half the places.

652
00:43:04,387 --> 00:43:04,868
Rym: I want to go.

653
00:43:04,888 --> 00:43:07,135
Scott: I don't go to those places.

654
00:43:07,155 --> 00:43:10,298
Scott: I Just go wherever jet blue takes me.

655
00:43:10,541 --> 00:43:14,909
Rym: Oh, you know if you want to go to all these cons with me next year You're gonna be flying on some not jet blue Airlines.

656
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:15,873
Scott: Yeah, but you know what?

657
00:43:15,953 --> 00:43:17,640
Scott: I'm not gonna be flying on the broken flight.

658
00:43:17,722 --> 00:43:18,558
Scott: It's gonna be perfect.

659
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:20,767
Rym: Yeah, we'll see about that.

660
00:43:20,868 --> 00:43:21,893
Scott: yeah, we will see.

661
00:43:21,913 --> 00:43:22,717
Scott: you'll see how I do it.

662
00:43:24,381 --> 00:43:26,267
Rym: We're flying out of Stewart for everything first off.

663
00:43:26,287 --> 00:43:27,230
Rym: Just screw JFK.

664
00:43:27,451 --> 00:43:27,772
Scott: Nope.

665
00:43:27,792 --> 00:43:28,153
Scott: Screw that.

666
00:43:28,173 --> 00:43:28,895
Scott: I'm going to JFK.

667
00:43:29,257 --> 00:43:29,477
Rym: What?

668
00:43:29,778 --> 00:43:32,691
Scott: All right, fine That way I won't have the shitty as delayed broken flights.

669
00:43:32,932 --> 00:43:34,860
Rym: Actually the delays had nothing to do with Stewart.

670
00:43:34,981 --> 00:43:36,230
Rym: The delays were just us air.

671
00:43:36,251 --> 00:43:39,085
Scott: No There's your mistake right there.

672
00:43:39,386 --> 00:43:47,500
Rym: us air as the cheapest flights and they're the only ones who fly to the places I wanted to go with the times I wanted to go for I'm willing to pay a little bit more to have a flight that doesn't have a problem.

673
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:50,420
Rym: No, you realize you don't get to pick if it has a problem or not.

674
00:43:51,021 --> 00:43:53,187
Rym: Yeah, I do and it's not a little bit more.

675
00:43:53,247 --> 00:43:57,217
Rym: the the difference between flying us versus flying someone else was like $200 more.

676
00:43:58,922 --> 00:43:59,344
Scott: We'll see.

677
00:43:59,404 --> 00:44:02,358
Scott: maybe we'll have a little competition where we both fly from.

678
00:44:02,378 --> 00:44:07,599
Scott: you know Wherever we want to the same destination and see who gets there first leaving this house at the same time.

679
00:44:08,583 --> 00:44:12,799
Rym: That doesn't work because I take flights based on price not on when they leave.

680
00:44:12,979 --> 00:44:16,519
Rym: hence I went to an amazement Thursday morning and I came back today.

681
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,587
Rym: Yeah, well is that that saved me another couple?

682
00:44:19,607 --> 00:44:21,994
Rym: it would have been to get the exact perfect flight.

683
00:44:22,275 --> 00:44:32,598
Rym: the flight that went there Thursday night and came back Monday morning and Was a direct flight and everything would have cost me about six hundred dollars round trip.

684
00:44:33,882 --> 00:44:41,319
Rym: Instead I paid about two hundred dollars round trip Mm-hmm, and all I had to do was get delayed for an hour in Philly and then get delayed for an hour in Philly.

685
00:44:43,082 --> 00:44:44,731
Rym: I got delayed going in got delayed coming back.

686
00:44:44,952 --> 00:44:46,319
Rym: Both delays were exactly one hour.

687
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,550
Scott: Yeah You got a DS.

688
00:44:48,692 --> 00:44:49,279
Scott: It's all good.

689
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:56,620
Rym: Yeah I also got free drinks on the flight back to Stewart as a Consolation for the fact I was in an episode on new Mario Brothers have wing now.

690
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:00,660
Rym: But we'll probably do that later because I'm sure we'll have enough gaming to talk about tomorrow as it is.

691
00:45:01,561 --> 00:45:06,558
Rym: Because remember I'm gonna cover the video gaming at an amazement tomorrow as I those video gaming there.

692
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:13,899
Rym: Oh, yeah My last bit about an amazement because I it's all trying to just spew out of my mouth and I'm trying to hold it in.

693
00:45:14,241 --> 00:45:16,440
Rym: Plus I want to go over my notes to make sure I didn't forget anything.

694
00:45:17,624 --> 00:45:18,900
Rym: An amazement is a small con.

695
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:22,754
Rym: Remember we did our series on anime conventions and we kind of broke it up into.

696
00:45:22,794 --> 00:45:28,079
Rym: there's three levels of convention Like the small con the mid-sized con and then the gargantuan con.

697
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:35,997
Rym: like Early, Ohio con it is the lower one may anime central is the mid one and like Otakana anime Expo or the third ones.

698
00:45:36,378 --> 00:45:38,143
Rym: Mm-hmm An amazement is.

699
00:45:38,244 --> 00:45:43,498
Rym: the is as big and awesome as a small con can be.

700
00:45:43,558 --> 00:45:46,148
Rym: it's like the Absolute top of a one hotel.

701
00:45:46,208 --> 00:45:46,791
Rym: small con.

702
00:45:46,811 --> 00:45:47,373
Rym: Mm-hmm.

703
00:45:47,513 --> 00:45:50,243
Rym: They have you know about 3,000 Change.

704
00:45:50,283 --> 00:45:55,219
Rym: people show up that they really can't expand without becoming the next level of convention.

705
00:45:56,382 --> 00:45:57,726
Scott: I guess they might have to step it up.

706
00:45:58,047 --> 00:45:59,973
Rym: The thing is because they're that big yet.

707
00:45:59,993 --> 00:46:00,956
Rym: There's still a small con.

708
00:46:00,976 --> 00:46:15,870
Rym: They have all the benefits of a big con, you know the full-on gaming room the the of the good cosplay the I Don't want to say good but as good as they're going to be given how good and these are today and the contest.

709
00:46:17,414 --> 00:46:19,109
Rym: And they're actually some clever ways of funny.

710
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:27,898
Rym: Actually the best music video at all of the con and I'll leave you all with this was to char from Original Gundam.

711
00:46:28,059 --> 00:46:38,488
Rym: great and it was just some polka song The Gundam polka I Got I could offer to a two-hour show on Wednesday.

712
00:46:39,412 --> 00:46:44,828
Scott: Well good, then we'll have to talk so much and then I can come back next week with some big something's.

713
00:46:45,089 --> 00:46:47,916
Rym: Yep Once again, welcome all of our new listeners.

714
00:46:48,578 --> 00:46:48,798
Scott: Yep.

715
00:46:49,259 --> 00:46:57,039
Scott: If you're a new listener, make sure you go to front row crew calm Yes and join the forum which actually is very lively.

716
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:59,486
Scott: Yeah more people keep joining constantly.

717
00:46:59,747 --> 00:47:00,870
Scott: It's getting out of control now.

718
00:47:01,271 --> 00:47:07,410
Rym: Yeah, I mean we started the forum way way back when we started GeekNights and we told all our friends to join and

719
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:11,539
Scott: It's slowly Kind of didn't do anything because

720
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:11,941
Rym: our friend

721
00:47:11,981 --> 00:47:12,905
Scott: is like a false start

722
00:47:13,046 --> 00:47:14,980
Rym: because our friends all talk We all just talk to each other.

723
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:22,150
Rym: We don't need a forum Yeah, and then we started getting listeners and after a couple of weeks all these people we didn't know join the forums.

724
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:24,236
Rym: And now the forums are self-sustaining.

725
00:47:24,277 --> 00:47:28,128
Rym: like I come back after five days and there's all these posts and they're opposed.

726
00:47:28,189 --> 00:47:28,590
Rym: It's great.

727
00:47:29,631 --> 00:47:31,582
Scott: I check it every day just cuz I have nothing to do at work.

728
00:47:31,944 --> 00:47:33,069
Rym: Yeah, I got stuff to do at work now.

729
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:36,162
Rym: Yep, plus I haven't even followed up on the news from the weekend.

730
00:47:36,262 --> 00:47:38,109
Rym: I didn't even check my email until I got back.

731
00:47:38,591 --> 00:47:42,870
Rym: Oh, yeah, and I saw there's a bunch of emails from fans and listeners.

732
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:45,202
Rym: Did Scott did you take care of those?

733
00:47:45,242 --> 00:47:46,290
Rym: Did you answer him or anything?

734
00:47:47,151 --> 00:47:47,513
Scott: Some of them.

735
00:47:47,533 --> 00:47:49,403
Scott: Yeah, all right the ones that were important.

736
00:47:49,423 --> 00:47:51,213
Scott: I Actually went.

737
00:47:51,374 --> 00:47:54,710
Scott: Oh, I actually read a bunch of fan emails on Thursday.
