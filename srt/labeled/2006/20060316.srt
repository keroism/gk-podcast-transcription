00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,357
Rym: It's Thursday March 16th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:12,659 --> 00:00:18,439
Rym: tonight We discuss a topic that normally and traditionally falls outside of the realm of geekery our favorite sports.

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,467
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:27,699
Scott: so an email late Yesterday night, I think and it said we're gonna start having weekly staff meetings.

5
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:31,197
Scott: now That's bad news for me because it currently have zero meetings at all.

6
00:00:31,217 --> 00:00:39,495
Scott: wow I have at least five meetings a week, and I'm in this middle of nowhere office all alone Which means the only way I'm getting to the meeting is by calling in on telephone.

7
00:00:39,776 --> 00:00:40,720
Rym: Oh, that's fantastic.

8
00:00:41,021 --> 00:00:43,091
Rym: Just call in and put the phone down.

9
00:00:43,473 --> 00:00:46,775
Scott: the meetings at 8 30 a.m I have to be at the office at 8 30 a.m.

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,907
Scott: When I'm usually there at 9.

11
00:00:48,907 --> 00:00:51,158
Rym: call it from your cell phone in the car in the car.

12
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,775
Scott: when New York I'll get a ticket, and I can't pay attention to driving.

13
00:00:53,795 --> 00:00:55,799
Rym: well You're not gonna actually gonna listen to this.

14
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,372
Rym: I mean you don't really want to go to the meeting do you know?

15
00:00:58,412 --> 00:01:02,812
Scott: but I if I don't have a hands-free I kind of had you know if I don't go to the first one.

16
00:01:02,852 --> 00:01:04,440
Scott: They'll be like hey, where's Scott girl?

17
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:06,485
Rym: Well get a hands-free.

18
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:09,573
Scott: I got it before tomorrow at 8 3 a.m..

19
00:01:09,994 --> 00:01:10,956
Rym: You could the mall still?

20
00:01:10,996 --> 00:01:12,380
Rym: oh, no the malls closed now.

21
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:15,132
Rym: Yeah, okay, the mall was open an hour ago.

22
00:01:15,172 --> 00:01:20,339
Scott: You could have gotten night's genius Not geek afternoon while the mall is still open.

23
00:01:21,701 --> 00:01:24,512
Rym: You know we could have done it earlier if you'd actually helped me do the show.

24
00:01:24,572 --> 00:01:27,748
Scott: instead of playing video games video games I have to play for the show.

25
00:01:27,768 --> 00:01:34,480
Rym: yeah, yeah, all right I love how almost everything we do in our lives now is research for our show as opposed to just screwing around.

26
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:41,557
Scott: I used to just sit there and couldn't figure out what geekery to indulge in and now I force myself to indulge in some sort of geek.

27
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,326
Scott: I'm accomplishing a Nothing something.

28
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:48,759
Rym: I'm not sure what I think of that.

29
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:54,713
Rym: So I actually have standing meetings like many days of the week.

30
00:01:55,054 --> 00:01:56,819
Rym: in fact today, I skipped them both.

31
00:01:58,162 --> 00:02:01,293
Rym: But I theoretically had two required meetings to attend.

32
00:02:01,575 --> 00:02:04,570
Rym: awesome, but anyway well that day I'm getting a new job somewhere soon anyway.

33
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,033
Rym: I don't care.

34
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:08,369
Scott: Yeah, I learned a long time ago I want a job with as few meetings as possible.

35
00:02:09,032 --> 00:02:10,559
Rym: It depends meetings mean less work.

36
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,327
Scott: No, cuz I don't have work anyway.

37
00:02:13,668 --> 00:02:17,120
Rym: Yeah, all right, so I had my own bit of annoyance driving into work today.

38
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:24,420
Rym: I usually listen to NPR Mostly because I hate the radio and everything on it and the CD player in my car doesn't work if it's cold outside.

39
00:02:24,881 --> 00:02:27,449
Scott: Sounds like a job for an iPod and I trip.

40
00:02:27,911 --> 00:02:29,456
Rym: I'm probably gonna buy an iPod.

41
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:34,898
Rym: I trip real soon Especially if I end up commuting on the train into the city every day.

42
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:37,389
Scott: well You don't need an i-trip if we're on the train you just need so well.

43
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,880
Scott: Here's the thing Eddie modick 6i headphones.

44
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:46,487
Rym: It's not worth a couple hundred bucks to get a good job Car stereo to replace my busted one.

45
00:02:46,587 --> 00:02:46,888
Scott: Oh hell.

46
00:02:46,908 --> 00:02:50,300
Scott: No well actually it sometimes best buy has it for like a hundred bucks.

47
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,165
Rym: It's still not worth it.

48
00:02:51,325 --> 00:02:53,879
Rym: Yeah, it's not worth it to fix that because it works half the time.

49
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,810
Scott: Okay, so you only get one if it's 50 bucks now.

50
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,262
Rym: I would pay the cost of an i-trip to have a working car stereo Mm-hmm.

51
00:03:01,443 --> 00:03:04,475
Rym: so if I already have an iPod buying an i-trip is a no-brainer.

52
00:03:04,555 --> 00:03:05,700
Scott: I trips less than 50 bucks.

53
00:03:05,941 --> 00:03:07,485
Scott: Yeah, you know what I discovered.

54
00:03:07,546 --> 00:03:08,729
Scott: my i-trip is the best thing.

55
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:13,653
Scott: I always tune it to eighty seven point nine to that's NPR around here.

56
00:03:13,673 --> 00:03:22,294
Scott: I Actually know it's nothing right in front of the house Yeah, but drive a little ways that way and it's something I don't know it works all the way to all the way to work.

57
00:03:22,516 --> 00:03:22,817
Scott: It works.

58
00:03:22,837 --> 00:03:23,340
Scott: Just fine.

59
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:32,935
Scott: I think it works so fine that all the people who have serious satellite radio are also using 87.9 to get it from their receiver to their car stereo.

60
00:03:33,076 --> 00:03:33,397
Scott: great.

61
00:03:33,678 --> 00:03:41,439
Scott: so When I drive around like every other day, I'll hear like five minutes of Howard Stern as someone with serious drives by me.

62
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:46,833
Scott: It's like all these people who have serious satellite radio only listen to Howard Stern.

63
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:47,816
Scott: They don't listen to anything else.

64
00:03:48,357 --> 00:03:52,312
Rym: like I swear to God Man that means the I trips real weak.

65
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:53,640
Scott: It is pretty weak.

66
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:53,801
Scott: It's.

67
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:57,720
Scott: it's supposed to be strong enough for just your car, but so is serious.

68
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,572
Scott: Well, the thing is I think the serious is a little more powerful.

69
00:04:00,914 --> 00:04:02,280
Rym: Well, the I trip should be more powerful.

70
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,340
Scott: Yeah, there was a hack for the one of the older I trip minis that I where you could make it more powerful.

71
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,079
Scott: I'm waiting for the I trip nano hack to make it more powerful.

72
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:11,282
Scott: We'll see.

73
00:04:12,004 --> 00:04:17,000
Rym: But anyway, I'm listening to NPR on the way to work and they're doing this bit about survivalist nonsense.

74
00:04:17,261 --> 00:04:19,333
Rym: You know, what are you gonna do if there's a bird flu pandemic?

75
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:20,539
Scott: There's a bullshit about that.

76
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:25,273
Rym: Yeah, I'm not going to get into the details of the stupidity I witnessed.

77
00:04:25,694 --> 00:04:30,049
Rym: but during this someone called in And I'll get to the details of this other stupidity.

78
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:30,511
Rym: I witnessed.

79
00:04:30,531 --> 00:04:32,880
Rym: that's mostly unrelated to the previous stupidity.

80
00:04:33,664 --> 00:04:46,332
Rym: so this old lady calls in and she starts talking about how scientists long ago discovered that olive leaves are an antiviral and that they curates and The government hushed it up because you know patent whatever.

81
00:04:46,512 --> 00:04:48,520
Scott: So why did the screeners even let this lady through?

82
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,773
Rym: Because they don't really screen so much and think of it this way.

83
00:04:52,034 --> 00:04:57,520
Rym: say you're screening anyway And someone calls your radio show and says I want to ask a question about blah.

84
00:04:57,943 --> 00:04:59,860
Rym: They say all right, and they put you in the queue.

85
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:03,278
Rym: Then you get on the show and you instead ask a question about blah.

86
00:05:03,298 --> 00:05:04,625
Rym: blah There's nothing they can do.

87
00:05:04,645 --> 00:05:14,039
Rym: but they push the button and you stop talking or they say oh, it's nice to hear from you click Yeah, but the thing is she sounded sane at first but they'd let her talk too long and then she turned crazy real quick.

88
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:18,140
Rym: One of those now, I don't mind the fact self nutcase.

89
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:29,400
Rym: She was just a crazy randy lady who seemed to believe that olive leaves will cure Asian bird flu if you get it and That you should stock up on olive leaves or olive leaf extract pills for the coming apocalypse.

90
00:05:29,922 --> 00:05:35,040
Scott: We should put some Asian bird flu in her house and see what happens now be like, hey, how's olive leaves doing?

91
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,731
Rym: Yeah, now here's what bothers me.

92
00:05:37,234 --> 00:05:41,360
Rym: I don't mind When someone like that has a crazy batshit belief.

93
00:05:41,962 --> 00:05:43,549
Rym: What bothers me other than it?

94
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:46,160
Rym: maybe they hurt someone with that belief or they hurt themselves with that belief?

95
00:05:46,624 --> 00:05:52,150
Rym: But when they present this belief To a public figure in a public forum who knows better?

96
00:05:52,471 --> 00:05:57,678
Rym: because the lady who was moderating all this on NPR obviously knows better She's an intelligent person.

97
00:05:58,322 --> 00:06:04,187
Rym: Instead of telling this lady exactly that she was wrong or this is complete bullshit She basically just fluffed it off.

98
00:06:04,267 --> 00:06:06,314
Rym: as you know, I'm not really familiar with the research.

99
00:06:06,354 --> 00:06:08,040
Rym: But yeah, it's a good thing to know.

100
00:06:08,141 --> 00:06:09,298
Rym: Thanks for your information.

101
00:06:10,063 --> 00:06:14,020
Scott: Well, that's the difference between mainstream media and blog type stuff.

102
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:18,078
Scott: If you're in the mainstream media, you had to be all polite and all this, you know, see ice.

103
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:27,670
Rym: I think that's a big fallacy not only on the part of greater human good, you know spreading truthful information instead of lies But more importantly from a money perspective.

104
00:06:28,072 --> 00:06:32,854
Rym: Look how well all the shock jock crap Oh people do compared to mainstream media in terms of money.

105
00:06:32,874 --> 00:06:34,583
Scott: Yeah, but it's NPR You have to.

106
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:37,799
Scott: you know, if you start doing that kind of stuff in NPR will be fired.

107
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:39,529
Rym: Oh, yeah, but here's the thing.

108
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:43,447
Rym: if NPR started doing that sort of thing How many new listeners would they get to the radio?

109
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:48,144
Scott: Yeah, but then how credible would it be to all the NPR people?

110
00:06:48,344 --> 00:06:49,388
Scott: they would think it's all.

111
00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:53,059
Scott: oh, it's just a one of those crap lowbrow things.

112
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:54,745
Scott: now It can't be respected.

113
00:06:54,826 --> 00:06:55,689
Rym: See this is the problem.

114
00:06:55,749 --> 00:07:03,260
Rym: I have is I am by no means a right-winger In fact, I'm the exact opposite of that in many ways in almost always.

115
00:07:03,763 --> 00:07:09,780
Rym: However, I am NOT a traditional Liberal at least in terms of how what people mean by the word liberal nowadays.

116
00:07:10,182 --> 00:07:12,375
Rym: I'm definitely not a leftist either dirty hippies.

117
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:19,060
Rym: now It seems to me that a lot of the people who listen NPR seem to be leftist in the leftist leftist sense.

118
00:07:19,401 --> 00:07:21,267
Rym: Left on every issue liberal on every issue.

119
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:29,360
Rym: and because I've noticed that NPR carries a lot of not ads But you know promotional consideration kind of deals which are basically just ads.

120
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,483
Scott: I thought it was accurate.

121
00:07:30,524 --> 00:07:32,711
Scott: does all the promotional considerations for NPR.

122
00:07:33,212 --> 00:07:41,692
Rym: They get a lot of very stupid sounding herbal remedy Organic whatever bullshit lately, really?

123
00:07:41,713 --> 00:07:46,380
Scott: Yeah Wow Those people shouldn't be allowed to advertise.

124
00:07:46,822 --> 00:07:51,580
Rym: Yeah, more importantly NPR regardless of whether or not they need the money should really not be catering to this.

125
00:07:51,962 --> 00:07:54,079
Rym: The thing is I think that their listeners want it, too.

126
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:57,972
Scott: Yeah, that's well, it's all about if they're marketing it on NPR.

127
00:07:57,992 --> 00:07:59,517
Scott: They must be getting results in NPR.

128
00:07:59,597 --> 00:08:01,944
Scott: Yep, so That's the thing.

129
00:08:01,964 --> 00:08:02,568
Scott: That's so great.

130
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:15,820
Scott: Why I don't really listen to the radio or Watch TV anymore and I go all for the internet and podcasts and all that sort of thing is because when you go there Someone's not afraid to say you're batshit crazy.

131
00:08:16,962 --> 00:08:25,320
Scott: Yeah, I know it was just an article today where this guy You know was said one Randy at the end and I was like actually know that Randy's false.

132
00:08:25,902 --> 00:08:30,178
Scott: And then I went somewhere else and there was someone else in a comment saying yep that Randy's fault.

133
00:08:30,278 --> 00:08:36,278
Scott: Haha It's like, you know, there's no comment section on an NPR radio show or on a TV show.

134
00:08:36,337 --> 00:08:40,131
Scott: on TV You know and it's all filtered and crap on the internet.

135
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:53,129
Scott: You're gonna get you know, the truth Might not you know, not everything on the internet is true But the truth is there somewhere and if you put in effort you can dig it up and if you're smart You'll recognize it plus on the internet.

136
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,840
Rym: People are very much willing to give you your bad medicine.

137
00:08:56,522 --> 00:09:00,714
Scott: Yeah, if someone comes around and says olive leaves will heal you bla bla bla bla bla.

138
00:09:00,734 --> 00:09:02,700
Scott: a thousand people will say you're fucking nutcase.

139
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:10,369
Rym: The problem is and when we get to my thing of the day a lot of people even though they're told that there's fucking nutcase And there's evidence everywhere.

140
00:09:10,409 --> 00:09:11,115
Rym: They still believe it.

141
00:09:11,397 --> 00:09:20,020
Scott: Yes However, the fact that there will be a story that says olive leaves and then a million comments the same nutcase That person might stay in that case.

142
00:09:20,301 --> 00:09:24,260
Scott: But at least people coming along seeing those comments won't also become nutcases.

143
00:09:24,581 --> 00:09:29,560
Scott: Sometimes sometimes more often than if NPR says olive leaves are good.

144
00:09:30,021 --> 00:09:34,957
Rym: I submit that if you read Fark more you'd have a much more cynical view of your fellow man.

145
00:09:34,977 --> 00:09:44,270
Scott: Oh it's cynical, but I also like Darwinism Because you know creationism sure isn't real.

146
00:09:44,872 --> 00:09:45,192
Rym: All right.

147
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:47,920
Rym: So anyway in the news, right Sony?

148
00:09:48,061 --> 00:09:57,577
Scott: Now all of you know that blu-ray While it's supposedly better This is the same Sony that hasn't done anything successful since like the ps2.

149
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:04,280
Rym: Yeah Yeah The Sony that stock is dropping like a rock that doesn't have their next-gen game console out.

150
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,668
Rym: That looks like they're gonna be competing not with Microsoft but with Nintendo Or their launch window.

151
00:10:09,989 --> 00:10:10,250
Scott: Awesome.

152
00:10:10,773 --> 00:10:20,988
Rym: And now that I think they Alright, so blu-ray was originally and still does Have DRM in it all sorts of DRM.

153
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:34,552
Rym: now one aspect of this has a bit in it where if you Use this token in your media and the media is played out of any Output that is either analog or not fully protected by HDMI.

154
00:10:34,993 --> 00:10:43,920
Rym: It will pretty much cut the resolution of your signal in half Mm-hmm in order to prevent HD copies of anything from getting out into the real world via the analog hole.

155
00:10:44,525 --> 00:10:50,880
Rym: All right now I Consider this to be a very terrible thing and so do you know all the people who have previous?

156
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,912
Rym: Generation HD TVs who won't be able to watch HD blu-rays because of this?

157
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:56,398
Scott: all the intelligent people.

158
00:10:56,638 --> 00:11:04,822
Rym: Yeah now Sony just recently backpedaled and said we're not gonna use that we're not gonna have it and That's half true.

159
00:11:05,103 --> 00:11:08,472
Rym: slash dot once again had a slightly misleading headline.

160
00:11:09,214 --> 00:11:09,736
Scott: Oh, wow.

161
00:11:09,776 --> 00:11:11,240
Scott: This is a big surprise.

162
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:22,534
Rym: So basically all Sony said is Media that we release will not in the foreseeable future Use the capability that blu-ray has to down.

163
00:11:22,554 --> 00:11:23,417
Rym: sample your media.

164
00:11:23,437 --> 00:11:24,160
Rym: Mm-hmm.

165
00:11:24,581 --> 00:11:34,679
Rym: So basically they're trying to trick everyone who hates DRM into adopting blu-ray with an empty promise that oh, don't worry Yeah that DRM features in there, but it's not gonna be used.

166
00:11:35,151 --> 00:11:35,460
Scott: You know what?

167
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:40,440
Scott: I get the feeling that my my prediction and guess is that they're going to not use it.

168
00:11:40,841 --> 00:11:48,927
Scott: That way people will buy blu-ray and they'll have all this hot HD TV and then after blu-rays been adopted Then they'll bow to the media companies.

169
00:11:49,027 --> 00:11:53,780
Scott: and well, they are a media company and thank you captain obvious of the redundancy team squad.

170
00:11:54,061 --> 00:11:54,865
Scott: Yeah, there you go.

171
00:11:55,348 --> 00:12:05,799
Scott: All right as someone who doesn't watch TV I'm real happy if I can download TV shows on the internet Especially if it's some legitimate thing that doesn't cause money or is very reasonably priced.

172
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,779
Scott: AOL has this thing called into TV that everyone is kind of going nuts about.

173
00:12:12,362 --> 00:12:12,522
Scott: Cuz.

174
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:14,771
Scott: they got some good shows here available.

175
00:12:15,032 --> 00:12:16,075
Scott: Absolutely for free.

176
00:12:16,256 --> 00:12:17,220
Rym: What shows do they have?

177
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:22,580
Scott: Well, the one that caught my eye was the one at the top of the list adventures of Briscoe County, June.

178
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,285
Rym: Haha, the show was awesome.

179
00:12:24,426 --> 00:12:25,208
Scott: Super awesome.

180
00:12:25,288 --> 00:12:29,602
Scott: All right, they got some nerds might like Babylon 5.

181
00:12:29,602 --> 00:12:31,487
Rym: I was all right the Beetlejuice cartoon.

182
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:32,851
Rym: That was actually terrible.

183
00:12:32,871 --> 00:12:33,934
Rym: I wish it would die.

184
00:12:34,315 --> 00:12:34,656
Scott: f-troop.

185
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:41,442
Rym: I Used to watch f-troop, but I don't know if I liked it because I was a little kid at the time freakazoid Freakazoid.

186
00:12:41,704 --> 00:12:44,739
Rym: Yeah freaky you freaking me hanging with mr.

187
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:44,980
Scott: Cooper.

188
00:12:46,701 --> 00:12:54,484
Scott: Alright, so they've got awesome old TV the fugitive I think is the best one and they got some other stuff like pinky in the brain Whatever.

189
00:12:55,029 --> 00:12:56,079
Scott: Alright, so they got good stuff.

190
00:12:56,981 --> 00:13:03,198
Scott: The problem here is that the only way to watch it is if you have Windows XP what Windows Media Player 10?

191
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:03,498
Scott: what?

192
00:13:03,518 --> 00:13:08,011
Scott: and Yeah, it's all DRM didn't shot to hell.

193
00:13:08,051 --> 00:13:11,100
Scott: it's high quality like they're really high quality videos and everything.

194
00:13:11,521 --> 00:13:18,720
Scott: But they're so DRM that like almost no one can actually watch them and you can't like download and put on your iPod or anything.

195
00:13:19,121 --> 00:13:19,784
Rym: I wonder.

196
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:22,675
Rym: I wonder if I could run Windows Media Player 10 in wine.

197
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,486
Scott: Maybe it would be tough.

198
00:13:27,727 --> 00:13:31,220
Scott: You need like the active X bullshit and there's a bunch of DRM and crap.

199
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:35,980
Scott: Yeah, and then you're gonna have to find a way to take that and encode it to like a divx or whatever.

200
00:13:37,101 --> 00:13:38,327
Scott: God, it's just not worth it.

201
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:39,452
Scott: There's so much DRM.

202
00:13:39,473 --> 00:13:40,860
Scott: It becomes difficult to watch.

203
00:13:41,881 --> 00:13:42,424
Scott: It's terrible.

204
00:13:43,068 --> 00:13:43,832
Scott: It's like they ruined it.

205
00:13:44,013 --> 00:13:45,220
Scott: They could have had it just perfect.

206
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:49,160
Scott: Just you know, like a YouTube or a Google video where you go and click and it plays.

207
00:13:49,487 --> 00:13:49,979
Rym: Well, you know what?

208
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,314
Rym: I hate to sound like a shill for Netflix, but we can see all those shows in Netflix.

209
00:13:53,695 --> 00:13:54,700
Scott: are all those shows on DVD?

210
00:13:54,981 --> 00:13:56,729
Rym: Almost all of them are hotness.

211
00:13:57,252 --> 00:13:58,397
Scott: I'm totally gonna rip them all.

212
00:13:58,698 --> 00:14:00,719
Scott: Yeah All right.

213
00:14:01,703 --> 00:14:02,469
Scott: Second thing here.

214
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,699
Rym: Yeah three news is today.

215
00:14:04,901 --> 00:14:11,900
Scott: You may or may not know there's going to be this is not some bullshit thing a star to Star Wars television shows.

216
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,125
Rym: now I have mixed feelings about this.

217
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:22,378
Rym: either we're gonna get awesome Star Wars action on a regular basis or This is going to be the worst thing that has ever happened.

218
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:33,365
Scott: Well the if you other than episode 1 if you ask Lucas arts, they'll say there are a lot of people who want more Star Wars and We're not gonna make any more movies.

219
00:14:33,867 --> 00:14:35,132
Scott: So we're gonna make a TV show.

220
00:14:35,313 --> 00:14:38,341
Rym: What about episode 7 8 & 9?

221
00:14:38,341 --> 00:14:40,788
Scott: They should have made those like in the 90s.

222
00:14:40,969 --> 00:14:41,611
Scott: If you ask me.

223
00:14:41,852 --> 00:14:44,499
Rym: Yeah, I want to see some Vice Admiral Thrawn coming back.

224
00:14:44,983 --> 00:14:46,699
Scott: Dude, who should be Vice Admiral Thrawn?

225
00:14:48,902 --> 00:14:51,274
Scott: I can't even think of a person who could be Vice Admiral Thrawn.

226
00:14:51,294 --> 00:14:51,757
Rym: There's no one.

227
00:14:51,797 --> 00:14:52,299
Rym: scary enough.

228
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,512
Rym: Maybe von Karma could have pulled it off.

229
00:14:54,673 --> 00:14:55,779
Scott: von Karma is not real.

230
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,133
Scott: Exactly, all right.

231
00:14:58,234 --> 00:15:02,980
Scott: anyway The articles I've read suggested there's gonna be two shows.

232
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:13,593
Scott: one of them is a. it says it's gonna be a CG computer animated show set during the Clone Wars, but Isn't there already the Clone Wars cartoon that was on Cartoon Network?

233
00:15:13,633 --> 00:15:15,300
Scott: Are they talking about the same thing or something new?

234
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:15,762
Scott: I don't know.

235
00:15:15,963 --> 00:15:21,671
Scott: Yeah, it could be something new that's computer-generated Animation or it could be that's.

236
00:15:21,752 --> 00:15:23,360
Scott: they were talking about the show that already exists.

237
00:15:23,762 --> 00:15:31,715
Rym: I don't think they're talking about the one that already exists because that one was very much not computer-generated Yeah, or it might have been really computer helped animation.

238
00:15:31,755 --> 00:15:32,157
Scott: I don't know.

239
00:15:32,177 --> 00:15:32,840
Scott: very good though.

240
00:15:33,001 --> 00:15:36,242
Scott: Yeah, so if you want if you like Star Wars You're.

241
00:15:36,664 --> 00:15:43,202
Scott: actually the Clone Wars cartoon is better than episodes 1 2 or 3.

242
00:15:43,202 --> 00:15:44,638
Scott: For absolutely sure.

243
00:15:44,638 --> 00:15:56,680
Scott: 100% is gonna be a live-action Star Wars TV show and they've already got Guaranteed they're going to be at least a hundred hours of this show in existence.

244
00:15:56,961 --> 00:15:58,810
Rym: Do they have the same actors for the parts?

245
00:15:59,171 --> 00:16:00,959
Scott: We don't know anything about it.

246
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,720
Rym: If you if you and McGregor isn't in it, I'm not watching.

247
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:13,072
Scott: the only thing we know about it is it's going to be taking place between episodes 3 & 4. so That's the part of everyone wants to know about.

248
00:16:13,494 --> 00:16:14,780
Scott: you know, what goes on between?

249
00:16:15,362 --> 00:16:21,446
Scott: You know Yoda goes to Daiglebaugh and then you know Luke Let him beat you.

250
00:16:21,486 --> 00:16:23,976
Scott: you had to let him defeat you.

251
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,682
Scott: you had to Okay, go crazy.

252
00:16:26,762 --> 00:16:27,002
Scott: I went.

253
00:16:34,569 --> 00:16:35,810
Rym: so things of the day.

254
00:16:37,235 --> 00:16:41,741
Scott: well, I just talked about Star Wars and My thing of the day also involves Star Wars.

255
00:16:41,962 --> 00:16:42,465
Rym: Oh, really?

256
00:16:42,485 --> 00:16:43,330
Scott: Yeah, really?

257
00:16:44,412 --> 00:16:47,569
Scott: It's a little quiz online and it's a pretty simple quiz.

258
00:16:47,931 --> 00:16:52,830
Scott: There's a long list of words on the left and for each word you have two choices.

259
00:16:53,673 --> 00:17:02,167
Scott: You can either say that word is the name of a Star Wars character Or you can say that word is the name of a web 2.0 application.

260
00:17:02,749 --> 00:17:05,782
Rym: now This is a lot harder than you would think.

261
00:17:06,224 --> 00:17:10,261
Scott: All right, let's do a few flicker.

262
00:17:10,281 --> 00:17:17,829
Scott: a web 2.0 Django spelled J A N G O obviously Star Wars.

263
00:17:18,911 --> 00:17:20,496
Scott: DJ A N G O.

264
00:17:20,776 --> 00:17:25,449
Rym: now, I'm gonna say web 2.0, but I have no idea what the hell that is.

265
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:27,222
Scott: It's a web 2.0 application.

266
00:17:27,242 --> 00:17:27,906
Scott: I don't know what it does.

267
00:17:29,013 --> 00:17:34,266
Rym: squid ooh That's a web 2.0 Thrawn.

268
00:17:34,934 --> 00:17:38,464
Rym: Ha we just talked about thrawn Pando.

269
00:17:39,651 --> 00:17:41,858
Rym: That's a Star Wars Meebo.

270
00:17:41,878 --> 00:17:45,569
Rym: I know it's web 2.0 only because you mentioned it earlier.

271
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,393
Rym: Fauveur Let's go.

272
00:17:48,474 --> 00:17:49,077
Rym: Star Wars.

273
00:17:49,138 --> 00:17:49,620
Rym: Whatever.

274
00:17:49,842 --> 00:17:51,250
Rym: I don't think we need to go through the whole survey.

275
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:54,561
Scott: Yeah, let me just say web 2.0 applications have.

276
00:17:54,722 --> 00:17:57,030
Scott: a lot of them have similar names to Star Wars characters.

277
00:17:57,091 --> 00:18:05,749
Rym: Let me put it this way I recognized a grand total of one thing on that entire list that I knew what it was if it wasn't Star Wars.

278
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:10,410
Scott: Wow, I got about four or five that weren't Star Wars.

279
00:18:10,852 --> 00:18:11,294
Rym: I was still.

280
00:18:11,394 --> 00:18:14,930
Rym: I did really well on the actual quiz part just because I know Star Wars real well.

281
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,762
Rym: So anything I didn't recognize the Star Wars.

282
00:18:16,823 --> 00:18:18,211
Rym: I said it was web 2.0.

283
00:18:18,211 --> 00:18:27,864
Scott: Yeah, I pretty much picked all the ones that I knew and the rest randomly, you know, cuz one of the two shot I got a 29 which is I think that says too much Kool-Aid.

284
00:18:27,884 --> 00:18:30,472
Rym: I Also got a 29.

285
00:18:30,472 --> 00:18:35,969
Scott: Yeah, the ideal score is between 11 and 20 because then you get the result of revel in it.

286
00:18:36,471 --> 00:18:42,008
Scott: You've achieved a rare Zen balance of pop culture knowledge and techno prowess and apparently still have a life to boot.

287
00:18:42,449 --> 00:18:50,330
Rym: Yeah It's not like that nerd geek dork survey where almost everyone who listens to GeekNights came up as a modern cool nerd.

288
00:18:50,735 --> 00:18:51,386
Scott: I'm a pure geek.

289
00:18:52,102 --> 00:18:52,430
Scott: Yeah.

290
00:18:53,592 --> 00:19:01,261
Rym: so for the most of you know that every now and then my thing of the day is something that just generally pissed me off as Opposed to something awesome and today is one of those days great.

291
00:19:01,903 --> 00:19:02,103
Rym: Now.

292
00:19:02,565 --> 00:19:10,170
Rym: This is on actually last week's JREF newsletter, so you might have already read it, but I think it bears repeating.

293
00:19:10,971 --> 00:19:13,622
Rym: Now there's this woman and her name is dr.

294
00:19:13,682 --> 00:19:18,328
Rym: Kaz DeMille Jacobson and she was going around speaking at churches.

295
00:19:18,348 --> 00:19:20,335
Rym: and Well here, you know what?

296
00:19:20,355 --> 00:19:20,576
Scott: I'm gonna.

297
00:19:20,596 --> 00:19:21,904
Scott: that's a warning sign right away.

298
00:19:21,924 --> 00:19:22,649
Rym: You know what I'm gonna do.

299
00:19:23,232 --> 00:19:27,170
Rym: I'm gonna go through a list of things that she's claims as a speaker.

300
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:32,730
Rym: These are things that she actually claimed to have done or known or been in the course of her life.

301
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:43,150
Rym: Okay, and here's the thing the people who listen to her and believe her They believed all of the things that I'm about to say and this is a non trivial number of people.

302
00:19:43,772 --> 00:19:44,072
Scott: All right.

303
00:19:44,634 --> 00:19:44,975
Rym: All right.

304
00:19:45,376 --> 00:19:48,987
Rym: She is the illegitimate grandchild of film director Cecil DeMille.

305
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:49,950
Scott: Wait, what's her name?

00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,935
Rym: Kaz DeMille Jacobson.

307
00:19:53,536 --> 00:19:53,897
Scott: All right.

308
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,946
Scott: Is that a real name or did she change her name or what?

309
00:19:57,287 --> 00:19:58,070
Rym: No one knows.

310
00:19:58,513 --> 00:19:58,835
Scott: Great.

311
00:19:59,319 --> 00:19:59,642
Scott: All right.

312
00:19:59,682 --> 00:20:00,690
Scott: She's got something.

313
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:06,930
Rym: All right, she was married to famous pop star Fabian and then later to Roberto Andretti.

314
00:20:08,271 --> 00:20:08,993
Scott: Who's Fabian?

315
00:20:09,013 --> 00:20:11,160
Rym: Uh, I don't know Fabio.

316
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,565
Rym: I don't know Fabio.

317
00:20:12,725 --> 00:20:20,670
Scott: I think if she was married to the Fabio That's that really big like yeah see romance novel but Roberto Andretti is of the famous car racing family.

318
00:20:21,061 --> 00:20:25,163
Scott: Yeah Mario and Michael are much better racers and no one knows about Roberto.

319
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:27,692
Scott: if she would have said Michael or Mario people would have been Like that's a lot.

320
00:20:27,732 --> 00:20:28,295
Scott: You're lying.

321
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:29,399

00:20:37,626 --> 00:20:38,770
Scott: Well, you could just look that shit up.

325
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:43,648
Rym: Yeah, well someone did look that up and I'll let you guess as to what the results were.

326
00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:47,620
Rym: Okay She founded worldwide charitable organizations.

327
00:20:47,861 --> 00:20:50,050
Rym: very easy to you know, just make up.

328
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,095
Scott: I just found it too.

329
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,587
Rym: She has a net worth of over a hundred million dollars.

330
00:20:53,768 --> 00:20:54,010
Scott: Me too.

331
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:59,130
Rym: She has been on presidential advisory committees under three American presidents.

332
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:01,858
Scott: Is that written down somewhere also?

333
00:21:01,878 --> 00:21:02,862
Rym: All right, here's where it goes.

334
00:21:02,922 --> 00:21:04,770
Rym: batshit like crazy.

335
00:21:05,414 --> 00:21:07,830
Scott: She was anyway, it's not crazy batshit already now.

336
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:16,870
Rym: Keep in mind that up till this point I could understand how some fairly ignorant people could believe this woman But the rest of these they also believed.

337
00:21:17,452 --> 00:21:23,208
Rym: She was in the elevator in the North Tower of the World Trade Center when the planes hit it on September 11th.

338
00:21:25,071 --> 00:21:36,301
Rym: Although horribly wounded she courageously led others to safety running out of the tower just as it collapsed Yeah while hospitalized from her 9/11 wounds.

339
00:21:36,522 --> 00:21:38,047
Rym: She was clinically dead for 28 minutes.

340
00:21:42,391 --> 00:21:44,196
Rym: While dead she came.

341
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:47,386
Rym: she was taken to heaven where she met Jesus and God.

342
00:21:47,446 --> 00:21:48,268
Scott: what what.

343
00:21:48,449 --> 00:21:49,397
Scott: okay Wait a minute.

344
00:21:49,417 --> 00:21:54,584
Rym: when she came back to life She had a rock in her hand given to her by Jesus himself.

345
00:21:54,845 --> 00:21:55,588
Scott: Where's the rock?

346
00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:03,985
Rym: Oh NASA tested the rock and said it was not of the earth nor of the moon and then refused to give it back and deny All existence of it.

347
00:22:04,896 --> 00:22:06,088
Scott: Why would NASA do that?

348
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:15,107
Rym: President Bush sent for her and he and mrs Bush heard her wonderous story and then they knelt down in front of her and asked her forgiveness for letting 9/11 happen.

349
00:22:16,995 --> 00:22:17,505
Scott: Mm-hmm.

350
00:22:18,553 --> 00:22:28,413
Rym: Now this woman was going around speaking at churches and the churches she was she was speaking at were very Excited to have such a famous and important person coming to their church and they believed every word She said.

351
00:22:28,453 --> 00:22:30,470
Rym: they considered her a wonderful promotional speaker.

352
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:37,690
Scott: Well, I mean if you're at a church that means you already believe that there's some crazy Jesus magic dude somewhere.

353
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:42,670
Scott: so It's not hard to convince those people of just about anything else.

354
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:49,215
Scott: I mean once you believe in something completely made up like I could get those people to believe in dragons and fairies and God knows what.

355
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:50,220
Rym: well, what was that quote?

356
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,170
Rym: because it came up today when we were arguing online.

357
00:22:52,351 --> 00:22:55,090
Rym: Uh, I submit that you were just as much an atheist as me.

358
00:22:55,371 --> 00:23:03,200
Rym: I just believe in one fewer God than you and when you realize why you don't believe in all those other gods You'll realize why I don't believe in yours.

359
00:23:03,502 --> 00:23:03,683
Scott: Yep.

360
00:23:03,723 --> 00:23:04,226
Scott: That's the one.

361
00:23:04,507 --> 00:23:06,868
Rym: Yeah That's the one.

362
00:23:07,563 --> 00:23:10,545
Rym: Yeah Yeah that there was a little inside joke.

363
00:23:10,947 --> 00:23:11,470
Scott: I got a plan.

364
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:17,730
Scott: Oh, let's go around to churches claiming all kinds of crazy shit and then big mischief.

365
00:23:18,132 --> 00:23:22,810
Scott: See my I note that for the entertainment of people like us everywhere.

366
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:28,070
Rym: How many times have we run across something like this where we realized how trivial it would be for the two of us?

367
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:32,964
Rym: To give up on our technology careers do whatever scam we're talking about and make millions.

368
00:23:33,726 --> 00:23:34,890
Scott: Oh, we're not evil fuckers.

369
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:36,916
Rym: I mean audiophile stuff.

370
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:41,649
Rym: You wouldn't believe the magic wood paper, whatever I could build and sell to people on.

371
00:23:41,709 --> 00:23:43,657
Scott: dude I'm gonna make wooden volume knobs.

372
00:23:43,938 --> 00:23:48,374
Scott: They decrease bad vibrations in your Sound system.

373
00:23:48,435 --> 00:23:48,675
Scott: Oh, no.

374
00:23:48,716 --> 00:23:50,422
Rym: No, they also add tonal clarity.

375
00:23:50,943 --> 00:24:00,189
Scott: Okay and bring out the rich Bases and they're made with special wood from rare trees and like the tropics and they're only five hundred dollars each.

376
00:24:00,832 --> 00:24:01,515
Scott: Buy one now.

377
00:24:01,877 --> 00:24:04,490
Rym: remember when we wanted to sell magic fairy powder on eBay.

378
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:08,082
Rym: Yeah, I remember that we were gonna grind up some sidewalk chalk.

379
00:24:08,383 --> 00:24:08,644
Scott: Yep.

380
00:24:09,286 --> 00:24:10,109
Scott: We should still do that.

381
00:24:10,573 --> 00:24:12,290
Rym: See, we just have too many scruples.

382
00:24:12,531 --> 00:24:21,318
Rym: But the thing is a lot of people out there don't have any scruples or they are scruples that didn't make sense I know because those people don't make sense.

383
00:24:22,081 --> 00:24:23,827
Rym: That was the dumbest analogy ever.

384
00:24:23,847 --> 00:24:26,493
Scott: you suck I'm just trying to be silly.

385
00:24:26,513 --> 00:24:29,581
Scott: We're talking about grinding up sidewalk chalk and selling it as fairy dust.

386
00:24:29,641 --> 00:24:29,822
Scott: All right.

387
00:24:33,532 --> 00:24:41,214
Rym: So anyway, it's Thursday, which means we can talk about whatever the hell we want and it's favorites week Which means it has to be something that we like Now.

388
00:24:41,655 --> 00:24:45,730
Rym: we debated for a while because there are basically infinite number of topics we could have talked about.

389
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:49,358
Scott: Yep, I mean it was really hard to pick one.

390
00:24:49,418 --> 00:24:49,599
Scott: like.

391
00:24:49,639 --> 00:24:49,779
Scott: what?

392
00:24:49,819 --> 00:24:50,582
Scott: favorite movies.

393
00:24:50,882 --> 00:24:52,808
Scott: Yeah fair books favorite anything.

394
00:24:52,828 --> 00:24:53,490
Rym: favorite geekery?

395
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:55,708
Rym: I thought about favorite women.

396
00:24:57,452 --> 00:24:59,801
Rym: We ended up on sports now.

397
00:24:59,821 --> 00:25:02,010
Rym: I justify this in that one.

398
00:25:03,151 --> 00:25:11,801
Rym: We actually liked sports more than you would think and I think that a lot of geeks out there actually enjoy certain sports more Than you would expect of the stereotypical geek nerd, whatever.

399
00:25:11,821 --> 00:25:20,090
Scott: I think what it really is is that People who are more nerdy or geeky like some of them are just like anti sport, which is fine.

400
00:25:20,592 --> 00:25:24,610
Scott: Some people are just like yeah, we don't care about sports at all, which is fine.

401
00:25:25,372 --> 00:25:30,530
Scott: But it seems like there's a large population of people that like care about one or two sports and not any others.

402
00:25:31,213 --> 00:25:36,523
Scott: When as opposed to the typical American like look at my dad my dad But no matter what time of the year it is.

403
00:25:36,543 --> 00:25:39,480
Scott: He's got one or two sports He's watching no matter what cuz that you know.

404
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,083
Scott: when he grew up.

405
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:41,330
Scott: He was all sports action.

406
00:25:41,601 --> 00:25:52,009
Rym: Yep The other thing is that it seems like non geeks tend to rally around sports as a safe topic to talk about at work And a lot of people seem to care about it way too much.

407
00:25:52,451 --> 00:26:08,090
Scott: Well, that's because geeks have other things they care about in their lives like their comic books or their video games or their whatnot Whereas normal folk who don't have any hobbies and aren't geeks, you know There's not much for them to go on except for TV shows and sports.

408
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:20,589
Rym: I mean, this is kind of sick and sad but where I work the after the Red Sox won the World Series a Lot of people didn't come in to work the next day because they were Yankees fans and they couldn't deal with it.

409
00:26:21,311 --> 00:26:22,114
Scott: Well, okay.

410
00:26:22,355 --> 00:26:26,830
Rym: Yeah, they may they took sick days because they couldn't deal with the fact that their team lost.

411
00:26:27,413 --> 00:26:38,749
Rym: I think that they're just using that as an excuse to Know you'd be these people when when something crazy happens in sports They get loud and angry and passionate about it.

412
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:46,470
Rym: They get more passionate about sports than they get about the war Iraq drugs, whatever and that's the reason that those sports exist.

413
00:26:47,235 --> 00:26:48,584
Rym: Yeah, well bread and circuses.

414
00:26:49,048 --> 00:26:49,269
Scott: Yep.

415
00:26:50,271 --> 00:26:57,056
Rym: So one thing we've noticed over the years is that there seem to be a certain number of sports At least we're mainstream sports first.

416
00:26:57,077 --> 00:27:00,287
Rym: then we'll get into the more esoteric sports that geeks and seem to really love.

417
00:27:00,909 --> 00:27:07,185
Rym: that Geeks tend to flock around more than maybe other people and definitely more so these sports than other sports.

418
00:27:07,746 --> 00:27:10,749
Rym: Mm-hmm number one Surprisingly seems to be hockey.

419
00:27:11,711 --> 00:27:12,553
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

420
00:27:12,593 --> 00:27:12,794
Scott: yeah.

421
00:27:12,814 --> 00:27:15,661
Scott: baseball basketball football ice hockey.

422
00:27:16,102 --> 00:27:17,946
Scott: ice hockey seems to be like.

423
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:19,652
Scott: I Don't know.

424
00:27:19,673 --> 00:27:21,089
Scott: Maybe it could be the violence.

425
00:27:21,672 --> 00:27:26,470
Rym: It could be the fact that a lot of tech schools originally were up in the north where hockey was big anyway.

426
00:27:27,816 --> 00:27:32,528
Scott: It could be that Hockey is only played above the Messier line where people are smarter.

427
00:27:34,351 --> 00:27:40,190
Rym: Also, I just note that all the old engineering school, you know MIT Caltech MIT doesn't have the greatest hockey.

428
00:27:40,431 --> 00:27:48,118
Rym: No, they don't have the greatest hockey, but the people who go to MIT love their hockey kinda RIT real big into the hockey.

429
00:27:48,138 --> 00:27:48,901
Scott: Yeah, it's where he went.

430
00:27:49,685 --> 00:27:50,890
Scott: So that's our big into hockey.

431
00:27:51,331 --> 00:27:56,390
Rym: Yeah, well, I was big into the hockey pretty much my whole life mostly because I was born in hockey town, you know Detroit.

432
00:27:56,892 --> 00:27:59,483
Scott: Well, yeah, but I was also, you know, I wasn't born.

433
00:27:59,503 --> 00:28:04,350
Scott: I was born in Queens, New York You know, I was born in a city that calls itself hockey town.

434
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,398
Scott: Yeah, my family is all Rangers fans, right?

435
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:10,487
Scott: But we're also Mets fans and Giants fans and all sorts of you know New York teams, right?

436
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:16,001
Scott: but of all those things Back in like the 60s.

437
00:28:16,082 --> 00:28:16,626
Scott: It must have been the 70s.

438
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:27,781
Scott: Maybe my family actually had season tickets to go to Madison Square Garden and watch Rangers games for like a couple years or so And like no other sport did they ever buy season tickets or anything?

439
00:28:28,122 --> 00:28:30,249
Scott: So I guess it's also a family thing.

440
00:28:31,132 --> 00:28:33,723
Rym: Well plus just hockey wise a lot of geeks I've known.

441
00:28:33,823 --> 00:28:35,470
Rym: I mean, we're not like really into hockey.

442
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:42,646
Rym: I mean, we love it and we'll watch it, but we don't you know obsess over stats or Actually care who wins outside of the game.

443
00:28:42,666 --> 00:28:43,510
Rym: We're watching at the moment.

444
00:28:43,852 --> 00:28:46,730
Scott: Yeah, like if you know if I'm watching a game right now, I care who wins.

445
00:28:46,851 --> 00:28:48,530
Scott: Maybe I won't if the teams or whatever.

446
00:28:48,597 --> 00:28:55,250
Rym: Yeah But if we're at a game at RIT watching RIT play We want to win so we can ridicule the people sitting on the other side of the ice.

447
00:28:55,451 --> 00:29:01,590
Scott: Yeah, and I wouldn't mind if like, you know, the team that I'm going for wins the World Championship or whatever.

448
00:29:01,871 --> 00:29:02,774
Rym: We're not skipping work.

449
00:29:02,814 --> 00:29:07,930
Scott: if our team loses no and you know, but if they lose whatever I don't really care.

450
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:10,099
Scott: It's just some guys somewhere that I don't even know.

451
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:17,558
Rym: I've just I've run into a lot of geeks who like hockey and I think definitely Statistically beyond random chance.

452
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:19,263
Scott: Yeah hockey is awesome.

453
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:21,169
Rym: Now aside from hockey at least us.

454
00:29:21,189 --> 00:29:26,730
Rym: personally I have no more geek correlations other than ice hockey, but we generally enjoy f1 racing.

455
00:29:27,393 --> 00:29:31,450
Scott: F1 racing if you don't know like it's not just a thing you see in video games.

456
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:35,929
Rym: There actually is Formula One racing and the thing is it's hard as hell to actually watch it.

457
00:29:36,631 --> 00:29:42,350
Scott: It's only only way you can see it in the United States is on speed TV or the Pirates Bay?

458
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:49,050
Scott: Well, I only I think the only time I've never seen it on the Pirates Bay before the race that just happened last weekend.

459
00:29:49,632 --> 00:29:53,530
Rym: And if this is a trend expect us to be talking about f1 races periodically.

460
00:29:53,932 --> 00:30:00,605
Scott: Yeah, if you want to see an f1 race, you can either watch speed TV this Sunday I think and like 2 a.m.

461
00:30:00,686 --> 00:30:08,050
Scott: Yeah Or curse they'll rerun the race at like sane hours on Sunday or just search on the Pirates Bay for Formula One.

462
00:30:08,231 --> 00:30:10,550
Scott: Well, no, you're gonna want to search for Malaysia.

463
00:30:10,812 --> 00:30:11,315
Rym: Well, you know what.

464
00:30:11,355 --> 00:30:13,287
Rym: search for Bahrain because that one's out there we know.

465
00:30:13,308 --> 00:30:15,008
Scott: yeah Well, who knows that torrents still up?

466
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:24,245
Scott: But yeah search for Bahrain to see the first race of this season or search for Malaysia Sometime after Sunday to this weekend and you can see the second Grand Prix.

467
00:30:24,446 --> 00:30:25,630
Rym: Yeah now we're not gonna talk about.

468
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:28,330
Rym: I mean we could do a whole episode on the sport just like we could do a whole.

469
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:31,141
Scott: That's all you have to know about Formula One is the following.

470
00:30:31,684 --> 00:30:40,687
Scott: They are the fastest most technologically advanced Four-wheeled motor vehicles on the face of the earth that run on gasoline and can turn.

471
00:30:40,947 --> 00:30:45,830
Scott: and they turn left They turn right they go up hills and they go down hills.

472
00:30:46,674 --> 00:30:47,055
Scott: That's it.

473
00:30:47,497 --> 00:30:50,169
Scott: It's the best NASCAR can suck its dick.

474
00:30:52,316 --> 00:30:57,850
Rym: Yeah, Formula One racing I mean I I've always enjoyed it as like as an idea as like the ultimate in racing.

475
00:30:58,493 --> 00:31:03,259
Rym: But I never really liked it because mostly because I never really was able to watch it I was never able to.

476
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:03,784
Scott: I used to why.

477
00:31:03,804 --> 00:31:13,227
Scott: I Remember there was like Indy racing and then Indy split up into Indian cart Which is now champ car and then open-wheeled racing which is you know race.

478
00:31:13,267 --> 00:31:19,170
Scott: those low Indy style race cars that where you can see the wheels they're sticking out of the sides are taller than the car.

479
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:20,494
Scott: That's open-wheel racing.

480
00:31:21,316 --> 00:31:25,630
Scott: that kind of died in the US and NASCAR took over with its stock car racing.

481
00:31:26,031 --> 00:31:35,270
Rym: so actually I used to live up in the mountains in poke way while I was still working for IBM as a co-op and The lady I lived with actually races open-wheel Ford at lime rock.

482
00:31:35,651 --> 00:31:38,383
Rym: Yeah, so she had all her race cars in the garage and I got to look at.

483
00:31:38,403 --> 00:31:48,430
Scott: I remember in like my younger days Like I always you know, I would watch racing, you know He'd watch like the Indy 500 and the Daytona whatever until my dad eventually really got into NASCAR type of stuff, you know.

484
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:54,164
Scott: Yeah But you know, I always liked the Indy stuff more because it was really.

485
00:31:54,244 --> 00:31:56,669
Scott: it was just a lot more interesting and they were going a lot faster.

486
00:31:57,711 --> 00:32:00,510
Scott: But then it kind of died because like, you know bullshit.

487
00:32:00,911 --> 00:32:11,177
Scott: and then I finally found f1 racing was real like Three years ago just by chance flipping through the channels at home You know and now it's I'm all on it.

488
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:12,681
Rym: if we had more money.

489
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:15,670
Rym: We'd totally get into go-kart racing, which is not a stupid sport.

490
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:18,579
Rym: It's actually very difficult enjoyable and awesome.

491
00:32:18,879 --> 00:32:26,315
Scott: F1 racing is really just go-kart racing with a freaking jet engine Instead of a you know Lawnmower engine.

492
00:32:26,757 --> 00:32:28,142
Scott: that's all f1 is really.

493
00:32:28,623 --> 00:32:28,744
Rym: now.

494
00:32:28,824 --> 00:32:31,595
Rym: as for the rest of the traditional sports I could really take him or leave him.

495
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:33,564
Rym: I mean American football.

496
00:32:33,684 --> 00:32:35,030
Rym: I enjoy occasionally.

497
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:38,429
Rym: I usually enjoy the marching band halftime shows more.

498
00:32:39,371 --> 00:32:40,497
Scott: Yeah, I mean like.

499
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:47,710
Scott: I enjoy a good game of football, you know But I don't really and I'll go to usually like one a year because my dad gets tickets or whatever.

500
00:32:47,811 --> 00:32:49,119
Scott: I think I went to two last year.

501
00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:56,790
Scott: It's like a Giants game and a Patriots game But like, you know, I don't really care and watch the Super Bowl and watch the Super Bowl in like six years.

502
00:32:57,535 --> 00:32:59,269
Rym: I actually really enjoy watching tennis.

503
00:33:00,151 --> 00:33:01,216
Scott: No, I don't tennis.

504
00:33:01,719 --> 00:33:03,690
Rym: I think the only reason I enjoy is that I used to play it.

505
00:33:03,811 --> 00:33:04,940
Rym: I I don't play it much anymore.

506
00:33:04,961 --> 00:33:05,748
Rym: I just don't have time.

507
00:33:05,828 --> 00:33:10,778
Scott: but Yeah, I don't like tennis Baseball, I don't mind going to baseball.

508
00:33:10,818 --> 00:33:13,769
Scott: But yeah, I'm not that and I'm gonna watch baseball on TV.

509
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:23,568
Scott: Ah, but I really what I do really like to watch is if if I had TV I would watch ESPN Sports Center during baseball season and you see all the crazy baseball plays in like two minutes.

510
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:25,977
Scott: It's the best Because that's all you really want.

511
00:33:25,997 --> 00:33:30,036
Scott: because you know, most of baseball is they're standing around Pitch throw it back.

512
00:33:30,378 --> 00:33:31,263
Scott: pitch throw it back you.

513
00:33:31,323 --> 00:33:36,102
Scott: if you cut all that out Sports Center shows you like the amazing baseball moments of the day.

514
00:33:36,142 --> 00:33:36,704
Scott: It's terrific.

515
00:33:37,205 --> 00:33:38,590
Rym: See what I like about a baseball game.

516
00:33:38,711 --> 00:33:43,590
Rym: I don't mind going to one because it's half, you know There's a sport going on and half just hanging out eating peanuts with all your friends.

517
00:33:43,811 --> 00:33:51,380
Scott: yeah, and baseball is really cheap compared to the other sports because there's so many games and Unless you're going to Fenway Park, it's not gonna sell out.

518
00:33:52,062 --> 00:33:58,166
Scott: So, you know, you can just Have fun Basketball, I just have zero interest in.

519
00:33:58,186 --> 00:34:00,174
Scott: yeah I think basketball.

520
00:34:00,676 --> 00:34:05,410
Scott: the real thing behind that is at some colleges like they get all excited about it.

521
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:09,870
Scott: And then I can see me going to basketball for the you know school spirit excitement.

522
00:34:10,071 --> 00:34:17,755
Rym: Yeah, I guess if RIT had an awesome basketball team instead of an awesome hockey team Yeah, you know you go for the school spirit But the sport itself.

523
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:31,208
Scott: the problem I have with it is that if they just score so often That it's completely unexciting and the only Potential excitement in a basketball game is if the score is close at the end.

524
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:37,536
Rym: There's opposed to hockey where if someone scores you jump up and scream Yeah, because when do they score?

525
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:38,018
Scott: in hockey?

526
00:34:38,058 --> 00:34:41,550
Scott: You're lucky if you get three goals in a game, that's crazy.

527
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:43,965
Rym: Yeah, they've actually been scoring quite a bit more lately.

528
00:34:44,065 --> 00:34:48,929
Rym: by quite a bit more I mean maybe four or five goals a game up to seven now, but that's just because they changed some of the rules.

529
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:52,141
Scott: It's like, you know That's the other thing football has going for it.

530
00:34:52,161 --> 00:35:01,587
Scott: when someone gets a touchdown in football You know in baseball they you know, you know, they score one run.

531
00:35:01,608 --> 00:35:06,120
Scott: you'd be like, yeah sometimes but Basketball it's like yay.

532
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:09,133
Scott: Yay Yay, yeah.

533
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:09,856
Rym: Yay.

534
00:35:09,977 --> 00:35:10,579
Rym: Well football.

535
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:12,970
Rym: The only thing I really don't like about it is the culture around it.

536
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,055
Rym: I mean go into a football game.

537
00:35:14,075 --> 00:35:17,129
Rym: You're surrounded by drunk loud idiots who care more about the game than you do.

538
00:35:17,734 --> 00:35:18,382
Scott: Yep, that's true.

539
00:35:18,402 --> 00:35:18,989
Scott: That's true.

540
00:35:19,491 --> 00:35:25,830
Scott: But it's actually strange because the fact that the ticket prices are so high at these events actually has a side effect.

541
00:35:26,171 --> 00:35:33,050
Scott: See I never go to any professional sporting event unless the tickets are free, which I happen to get quite often actually through precarious means.

542
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:38,953
Rym: Yeah, I used to go to games that we paid for back when I lived in Detroit when the Red Wings but that was expensive As hell.

543
00:35:38,993 --> 00:35:42,930
Scott: I would never pay for a professional sports ticket unless there was a damn good reason.

544
00:35:43,653 --> 00:35:47,289
Rym: We paid to see the Stanley Cup finals when the Red Wings won for the first time.

545
00:35:47,309 --> 00:35:48,935
Scott: yeah Yeah, that's it.

546
00:35:49,076 --> 00:35:50,524
Scott: You know, there's a damn good reason.

547
00:35:50,544 --> 00:35:54,570
Scott: Yeah, but You know what happens is these high prices?

548
00:35:55,431 --> 00:35:59,023
Scott: They still sell out because you know, it's about supply and demand and capitalism.

549
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,910
Scott: So the high prices are justified.

550
00:36:01,091 --> 00:36:05,885
Scott: They fill their arena with people but at the same time it keeps poor people out.

551
00:36:05,946 --> 00:36:10,266
Scott: now, you know I don't know what the discriminating against poor people say.

552
00:36:10,286 --> 00:36:10,950
Scott: whatever you want.

553
00:36:11,592 --> 00:36:14,381
Rym: But it may think there's a very simple politically correct way to state this.

554
00:36:15,044 --> 00:36:19,899
Rym: not all poor people are asshats But most asshats are poor people exactly.

555
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:34,150
Scott: So when you go to sporting events nowadays, you know professional ones Especially if you have really good seats, you know, the people might be drunk guys But they're like drunk business guys and not like big fat smelly drunk guys.

556
00:36:34,912 --> 00:36:39,750
Scott: You know like when they show you on TV like the five scary fat guys this stuff painted on their chest.

557
00:36:40,193 --> 00:36:46,886
Scott: Those guys are in the way upper deck all alone and there's only one set of them or they're at the NASCAR or they're at the NASCAR.

558
00:36:46,947 --> 00:36:49,037
Scott: NASCAR has That's not that's.

559
00:36:49,077 --> 00:36:51,229
Scott: here's something you want to get some perspective going.

560
00:36:53,372 --> 00:36:58,468
Scott: The average like stadium can hold like tens of thousands of people at NASCAR.

561
00:36:59,372 --> 00:37:09,584
Scott: They have grandstands that hold hundreds of thousands of people and they're just wooden benches that go way Up and the tickets are actually real cheap.

562
00:37:09,664 --> 00:37:10,710
Scott: No, they're really not.

563
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:14,850
Rym: Well, they're they're real cheap if you sit in the crapo area and you don't have to drive to the place.

564
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,029
Scott: Yeah, depending on where you sit.

565
00:37:16,231 --> 00:37:22,290
Scott: I mean if you sit way in the shitter in a NASCAR track, you can maybe spend 20 bucks.

566
00:37:22,711 --> 00:37:23,394
Rym: Yeah, what's I'm saying?

567
00:37:23,494 --> 00:37:25,201
Rym: It's because there's so many seats.

568
00:37:25,241 --> 00:37:29,707
Rym: There are a lot of cheap seats available to cheap people Yeah, but they usually sell out most of their.

569
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:34,164
Scott: oh, yeah F1 is is so international that it depends.

570
00:37:34,205 --> 00:37:35,330
Scott: it goes from country to country.

571
00:37:35,411 --> 00:37:40,657
Scott: Like if you go to see like the middle of nowhere Grand Prix in the country, no one cares about.

572
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:49,668
Scott: it's gonna be pretty much empty, but if you go to see the Like the the European Grand Prix or the Monaco Grand Prix, it's sold out.

573
00:37:49,708 --> 00:37:52,759
Scott: Forget it Actually, I think you can still get tickets to Monaco.

574
00:37:52,799 --> 00:37:54,124
Scott: But how you gonna get there?

575
00:37:54,506 --> 00:37:55,490
Rym: Yeah, where are you gonna stay?

576
00:37:56,331 --> 00:37:58,180
Rym: Yeah, there are two places in Monaco.

577
00:37:58,482 --> 00:38:08,317
Rym: There is the rich place Meaning orders of magnitude more money than you'll make in a year just to stay there for a week Or the poor place.

578
00:38:08,377 --> 00:38:10,746
Scott: there really is no poor hotel.

579
00:38:10,927 --> 00:38:16,029
Rym: No, no by poor I mean the shanty town on the other side of the mountain where all the servants live.

580
00:38:16,773 --> 00:38:18,421
Scott: Yeah, you know, you can't actually stay there.

581
00:38:18,441 --> 00:38:19,507
Scott: this there's no hotel there.

582
00:38:19,849 --> 00:38:22,162
Rym: Oh, yeah You'd have to sleep in the street and be eaten by dogs.

583
00:38:22,323 --> 00:38:25,318
Scott: Yeah, if you don't know about Monaco I'm sure there's a Wikipedia page about it.

584
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:27,890
Scott: You can learn all about the principality of Monaco.

585
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:35,090
Scott: It's basically a little tiny place that's full of casinos and hotels and fanciness and they have a race in the street there.

586
00:38:35,311 --> 00:38:39,850
Rym: Imagine if the riches of Dubai and the poverty of Rwanda were next to each other.

587
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,616
Scott: Well the pie it's not that poverty.

588
00:38:41,696 --> 00:38:42,699
Rym: No, but it's down there.

589
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,683
Scott: It's like Mexico.

590
00:38:43,703 --> 00:38:45,850
Rym: No Mexico's got a lot of nice places.

591
00:38:46,111 --> 00:38:48,346
Scott: Well, you know, it's like Mexican workers poverty.

592
00:38:48,547 --> 00:38:50,502
Rym: Nah It's a little worse than that.

593
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:51,590
Rym: I think I don't know.

594
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:54,243
Scott: I've never actually seen it because you can't get a picture of it.

595
00:38:54,424 --> 00:38:55,610
Rym: I remember we read a Wikipedia.

596
00:38:55,811 --> 00:38:58,941
Rym: It's probably a slot like maybe one step above city of God.

597
00:38:59,322 --> 00:39:01,690
Rym: Yeah, I were just talking on our asses at this point.

598
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:08,356
Scott: Yeah Pretty much all you have to know about if you want to actually go to an f1 race is let's say I wanted to go To the Montreal Grand Prix.

599
00:39:08,376 --> 00:39:09,863
Scott: It's in Montreal not too far away.

600
00:39:09,883 --> 00:39:11,490
Scott: It would cost me thousand dollars.

601
00:39:13,192 --> 00:39:14,362
Rym: There are thousand dollars.

602
00:39:14,443 --> 00:39:15,290
Rym: I could go to Japan.

603
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:24,316
Scott: Yeah that includes getting there staying in the hotel and the way they price the tickets is You basically don't buy the race.

604
00:39:24,356 --> 00:39:26,362
Scott: you buy the race weekend because it's more.

605
00:39:26,442 --> 00:39:28,850
Scott: it's just stupid not to and you have to go.

606
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:29,231
Scott: you Go to.

607
00:39:29,271 --> 00:39:33,350
Scott: you end up going to two practice sessions the qualifying and the race, you know.

608
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:39,159
Scott: So you're there for like Friday Saturday Sunday going to all these different things And it cost you a thousand dollars in total.

609
00:39:39,742 --> 00:39:40,003
Rym: All right.

610
00:39:40,023 --> 00:39:43,716
Rym: So anyway, let's talk a bit about Non-traditional non mainstream sports.

611
00:39:44,037 --> 00:39:48,147
Scott: Well, maybe let's try to keep it to things that are actually sports.

612
00:39:48,368 --> 00:39:50,133
Rym: Oh, yeah, definitely sports We're not going to talk about.

613
00:39:50,153 --> 00:39:51,679
Rym: you know, playing FPS is online.

614
00:39:51,819 --> 00:39:54,550
Rym: Yeah, or DDR but still competitive events.

615
00:39:55,051 --> 00:40:01,647
Scott: Well sports are specifically like games that involve physical activity or athletics in some way.

616
00:40:01,908 --> 00:40:02,589
Scott: That's how I put it.

617
00:40:03,171 --> 00:40:09,887
Rym: Well, I just want to bring up because I think one of our favorite sports and both of us actually are big fans of this Trobriand Island cricketing.

618
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,858
Scott: Trobriand Island cricket is freaking swear.

619
00:40:13,099 --> 00:40:17,452
Rym: now to put it very very briefly the Trobriand Islands The.

620
00:40:17,733 --> 00:40:25,642
Rym: it was the British who were there for a long time and I think they eventually left and the Islander natives Watched them play cricket and they liked the game a lot.

621
00:40:25,682 --> 00:40:27,529
Rym: They used to learn how to play cricket from those guys.

622
00:40:28,053 --> 00:40:30,510
Scott: Actually, I think the cricket they play is kind of broken, but doesn't matter.

623
00:40:30,699 --> 00:40:43,819
Rym: Yeah so then those guys left and they kept playing cricket and They did because of their culture and this whole aspect of community, you know, the whole community should participate Whole towns and villages in these islands.

624
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:57,502
Rym: basically a team of cricket will consist of everyone in the village yep, and they'll go and they'll put like a hundred people on the field and They do these crazy crazy Dances and rituals during the game and it's just awesome.

625
00:40:57,904 --> 00:40:59,410
Rym: Look around try to find videos of it.

626
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,656
Rym: It's quite a sight to see.

627
00:41:00,757 --> 00:41:03,028
Scott: and they actually use this like instead of war.

628
00:41:03,791 --> 00:41:05,921
Scott: Yeah, like you have they used to stab each other.

629
00:41:06,082 --> 00:41:07,830
Scott: now, they just play cricket and accounts.

630
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:12,709
Scott: Yeah, imagine if we could go play cricket with like Iraq and then when we won we own them.

631
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:17,525
Rym: Awesome, of course, we saw how that ended with the Zulu's.

632
00:41:17,988 --> 00:41:22,050
Rym: Yeah The thing is I don't think the Trobri and Islanders are gonna stop playing their cricket anytime soon.

633
00:41:22,191 --> 00:41:23,296
Scott: I don't think they are now.

634
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:25,588
Scott: Maybe there's a video going somewhere in the internet.

635
00:41:26,892 --> 00:41:28,461
Scott: Now there must be an article in the internet.

636
00:41:28,521 --> 00:41:29,165
Rym: There's got to be.

637
00:41:29,205 --> 00:41:29,829
Rym: there's got to be.

638
00:41:30,851 --> 00:41:40,750
Rym: Now, I know we've talked a bit about curling lately and I just want to say independent of the fact There's obviously a marketing blitz going on now trying to get people to like cricket for some similar reason.

639
00:41:41,254 --> 00:41:44,153
Rym: cricket curling I've played.

640
00:41:44,334 --> 00:41:45,880
Rym: I've curled before and it's fun.

641
00:41:46,362 --> 00:41:50,378
Rym: It's not fun to watch in my opinion But if you ever get a chance, it's fun to play.

642
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:50,779
Rym: It's.

643
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:55,075
Rym: it's as fun to play as like shuffleboard or bocce It's pretty much shuffleboard on ice.

644
00:41:55,477 --> 00:41:57,945
Scott: Not not chess on ice shuffleboard.

645
00:41:57,966 --> 00:42:03,790
Scott: Yes on ice my ass Yeah, and shuffleboard actually, you know, I'm not some word isn't the greatest thing ever.

646
00:42:04,392 --> 00:42:08,810
Scott: But if I'm hanging with my grandpa down in Florida, I'll play shuffleboard with the old man a couple times.

647
00:42:08,871 --> 00:42:11,513
Scott: Why not, you know, whatever It's cool.

648
00:42:12,355 --> 00:42:16,064
Scott: So I just occurred to me that there are a lot of sports.

649
00:42:16,104 --> 00:42:28,740
Scott: We've neglected very very important ones such as dodgeball dodgeball and Speedball wall ball kickball.

650
00:42:29,021 --> 00:42:34,799
Rym: kickball isn't one of my favorite sports ever and It requires almost no skill almost no athletics.

651
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,749
Rym: a bunch of guys get together play about half a game then give up and go home.

652
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:41,964
Rym: wiffle ball used to play mad wiffle ball when I was a kid.

653
00:42:42,145 --> 00:42:43,110
Scott: wiffle ball rocks.

654
00:42:45,752 --> 00:42:48,824
Scott: You know all the things that nerds actually like to play instead of just watch.

655
00:42:48,864 --> 00:42:50,672
Scott: I mean we don't play f1 racing We don't.

656
00:42:50,973 --> 00:42:53,910
Scott: I guess we could play hockey, but we don't really play ice hockey, you know.

657
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:56,161
Scott: But yeah, we can play all these things.

658
00:42:56,261 --> 00:42:57,990
Rym: I used to used to play a lot of roller hockey.

659
00:42:58,491 --> 00:43:01,340
Scott: Roller hockey you could play but ice hockey not so much.

660
00:43:01,821 --> 00:43:02,102
Rym: Actually.

661
00:43:02,122 --> 00:43:04,830
Rym: Yeah, cuz you know, I lived in the frigid wastelands of Michigan.

662
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,317
Scott: Yeah, but I don't see you doing it.

663
00:43:07,477 --> 00:43:09,145
Scott: You don't even have a hockey skate.

664
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,288
Rym: Well part of it Is that I don't have free time anymore, too.

665
00:43:13,511 --> 00:43:19,768
Rym: There aren't just like ponds and lakes all over the place where you can just play hockey Around here like there were where I grew up.

666
00:43:20,211 --> 00:43:24,425
Scott: whatever the point is is that I'm talking about the the geeky sports that you can actually play.

667
00:43:24,465 --> 00:43:30,009
Rym: that got to give a nod to a Marching band drill core stuff, which a lot of guys a lot of geeks in high school really get into.

668
00:43:31,091 --> 00:43:32,396
Scott: I don't think it's really.

669
00:43:32,597 --> 00:43:33,521
Rym: I consider it a sport.

670
00:43:33,581 --> 00:43:33,782
Rym: It's the.

671
00:43:33,822 --> 00:43:40,570
Rym: it's a sport in the same way that uh, synchronized swimming or Yeah skating anything like that figure skating.

672
00:43:41,113 --> 00:43:47,100
Scott: I don't know if those are really sports because to me a sport is like, you know It's like a game but it involves physical activity.

673
00:43:47,141 --> 00:43:48,165
Scott: Those aren't really games.

674
00:43:48,205 --> 00:43:48,546
Rym: They are.

675
00:43:48,566 --> 00:43:54,476
Rym: they're more like Shows, they're also competitions Petitions with definitive rules.

676
00:43:54,978 --> 00:43:58,210
Scott: Yeah, but it's like you get a. it's like a subjective score from a judge.

677
00:43:58,271 --> 00:44:05,470
Scott: It's it's as if like two people put on Movies and then someone like decided scored the movies according to some system and decided who was the winner.

678
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:06,233
Rym: Well, here's the thing.

679
00:44:06,374 --> 00:44:07,719
Rym: There's a system and it's at.

680
00:44:07,759 --> 00:44:10,450
Rym: the system itself is actually very objective in most ways.

681
00:44:10,812 --> 00:44:12,060
Rym: It comes down to you have.

682
00:44:12,523 --> 00:44:23,454
Rym: it varies from sports to sport but a lot of sports like this you start with a perfect score or A near perfect score and you lose points if you do specific things in specifically wrong ways Mm-hmm.

683
00:44:23,856 --> 00:44:26,210
Scott: So it's a showcase like I would just go out and come back.

684
00:44:26,371 --> 00:44:27,588
Scott: I would just go out there and get.

685
00:44:27,628 --> 00:44:28,352
Rym: well Here's the thing.

686
00:44:28,573 --> 00:44:33,470
Rym: you also get points for take for actually pulling off difficult maneuvers more.

687
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:35,140
Scott: But I thought you said you start with the perfect score.

688
00:44:35,241 --> 00:44:36,670
Rym: It depends on the sport.

689
00:44:36,811 --> 00:44:44,050
Rym: I'm not gonna get into the details of all these different sports Mm-hmm, but or in the very least you start with a perfect score and there's a list of things that you must do.

690
00:44:45,731 --> 00:44:46,615
Rym: Aha things like that.

691
00:44:46,696 --> 00:44:53,770
Rym: It's actually much less subjective than a lot of people think and Marching band actual like drum corps competitions are the same way.

692
00:44:54,091 --> 00:45:01,190
Rym: I mean it depends if you didn't go to a high school that actually competed in you know Like national or at least state like marching band competitions.

693
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:08,509
Rym: You probably didn't get any of this But there is a fairly fierce competitive marching band circuit out there and you can watch him on TV.

694
00:45:09,932 --> 00:45:12,987
Scott: I don't have TV now and I've never seen it on TV ever.

695
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:13,550
Scott: really.

696
00:45:14,193 --> 00:45:16,465
Rym: I can pull up a whole ton of them if you want to watch him.

697
00:45:16,666 --> 00:45:17,390
Scott: No, not really.

698
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:18,908
Rym: In fact, they were my thing of the day a while ago.

699
00:45:19,791 --> 00:45:21,759
Scott: Yeah, you know what cheerleading is on TV.

700
00:45:21,799 --> 00:45:22,843
Scott: I've seen that on TV.

701
00:45:22,903 --> 00:45:23,224
Scott: You know what.

702
00:45:23,244 --> 00:45:23,666
Scott: they know what.

703
00:45:23,726 --> 00:45:24,630
Scott: that's not a sport either.

704
00:45:24,831 --> 00:45:27,130
Rym: Well, I consider it generally a stupid sport.

705
00:45:28,271 --> 00:45:30,898
Rym: It's basically the same as all those others in terms of how it's judged.

706
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,483
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

707
00:45:32,804 --> 00:45:35,773
Scott: that just doesn't fit into Scott's Definition of sport.

708
00:45:35,914 --> 00:45:36,938
Rym: Well, it fits into Rym's.

709
00:45:37,078 --> 00:45:40,050
Scott: It's got to be a game and it's got to involve athletics.

710
00:45:40,331 --> 00:45:41,896
Rym: It's a game and it involves athletics.

711
00:45:42,017 --> 00:45:42,899
Scott: It's not a game.

712
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:43,843
Scott: It's it's a show.

713
00:45:43,863 --> 00:45:44,625
Scott: That's right.

714
00:45:44,706 --> 00:45:45,388
Rym: It's judges though.

715
00:45:45,428 --> 00:45:46,030
Rym: It's competitive.

716
00:45:46,653 --> 00:45:48,380
Scott: Yeah, it's just not a game.

717
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,204
Rym: how is it not a game?

718
00:45:49,264 --> 00:45:49,867
Rym: it's competitive.

719
00:45:49,907 --> 00:45:50,510
Rym: someone wins.

720
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:52,675
Scott: It doesn't matter if someone wins.

721
00:45:52,715 --> 00:45:54,539
Rym: someone wins by an objective measurement.

722
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:55,601
Scott: No.

723
00:45:55,802 --> 00:45:56,143
Rym: Yeah.

724
00:45:56,584 --> 00:45:57,285
Scott: Oh look sub.

725
00:45:57,305 --> 00:45:57,827
Scott: It's not.

726
00:45:58,388 --> 00:45:58,909
Rym: he's got 98 points.

727
00:45:59,551 --> 00:46:01,417
Rym: Oh, he flubbed his double half turn.

728
00:46:01,437 --> 00:46:01,557
Rym: Now.

729
00:46:01,577 --> 00:46:02,741
Rym: He's got 96 points.

730
00:46:02,961 --> 00:46:04,045
Rym: No, what do you mean?

731
00:46:04,085 --> 00:46:05,630
Scott: No, it's not the same.

732
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:06,112
Rym: Why not?

733
00:46:06,414 --> 00:46:07,258
Scott: It's a whole different thing.

734
00:46:07,298 --> 00:46:07,640
Rym: What do you mean?

735
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,524
Rym: It's a whole different thing.

736
00:46:08,624 --> 00:46:09,730
Rym: I said that it's no different.

737
00:46:10,214 --> 00:46:19,236
Scott: Wait, you're saying that that You know you doing something and then some people judge you and give you a score is not is the same thing?

738
00:46:19,336 --> 00:46:26,970
Scott: is you play a game based on rules and you know, you The game progresses and then you know, whoever scores the most points wins?

739
00:46:27,291 --> 00:46:33,279
Rym: I say they're fundamentally the same because you if the game progresses whoever scores the most points wins based on a mostly objective System.

740
00:46:33,746 --> 00:46:34,030
Scott: All right.

741
00:46:34,131 --> 00:46:43,731
Scott: so now we're gonna make a German board game where you know We all just play and then at the end someone comes over and you know Looks at how he played and then gives us this well That

742
00:46:43,771 --> 00:46:49,010
Rym: person has to have a predefined system that we all know and understand as to how he's going to determine the winner.

743
00:46:49,251 --> 00:46:50,615
Scott: Then why even have the judges?

744
00:46:50,655 --> 00:46:54,868
Rym: if there's a predefined system then because the judges are just the people who enact that system.

745
00:46:54,929 --> 00:46:58,581
Scott: you idiot Yeah, but you don't need people to enact the system.

746
00:46:58,602 --> 00:46:59,746
Scott: and like a game of baseball.

747
00:46:59,766 --> 00:47:00,690
Scott: It's just you score points.

748
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:02,946
Scott: You say up we got three and you see the three points.

749
00:47:02,966 --> 00:47:03,470
Scott: There they are.

750
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:10,430
Rym: Yeah, you realize the judges are basically just like the referees in a game of hockey They facilitate and they did and they take care of the scoring.

751
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:17,068
Scott: So, you know theoretically you could just have a competition without judges and you would know exactly how many points you got.

752
00:47:17,489 --> 00:47:25,391
Rym: actually Yeah, depending on the sport some sports I mean some of those sports are very subjective and I don't really consider them in this but the ones that have objective systems of Scoring.

753
00:47:25,411 --> 00:47:30,250
Rym: Yes, I don't know multiple judges would come up with the same score unless they screwed up.

754
00:47:30,917 --> 00:47:32,030
Rym: That's why they have multiple judges.

755
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:36,268
Rym: So you can like if three judges say one thing and once there's the other thing it all evens out in the end.

756
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:38,630
Scott: How does that even happen if it's objective?

757
00:47:39,931 --> 00:47:41,405
Scott: If it's objective, how can it happen?

758
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:41,829
Scott: that you know?

759
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:49,259
Rym: Just because something's objective doesn't mean you might not miss something one judge might not notice that he screwed that he did something wrong In a specific way.

760
00:47:49,562 --> 00:47:52,475
Scott: one judge might sneeze See, but you can't mess.

761
00:47:52,515 --> 00:47:53,881
Scott: a game of baseball is a game.

762
00:47:53,921 --> 00:47:54,664
Scott: You can't mess up.

763
00:47:54,724 --> 00:47:57,040
Scott: the guy steps on the plate You know, all right, you can.

764
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,112
Rym: they often mess up There.

765
00:47:59,173 --> 00:48:02,250
Rym: it's very vague often as to exactly when something's a strike or not.

766
00:48:02,371 --> 00:48:06,578
Rym: A lot of times a ref will make a bad call Determining in what the call is.

767
00:48:06,699 --> 00:48:08,710
Scott: once you know what the call is you there it is.

768
00:48:08,730 --> 00:48:09,754
Scott: You have a scorecard.

769
00:48:09,834 --> 00:48:11,480
Scott: anyone at the game can keep score.

770
00:48:11,841 --> 00:48:14,049
Rym: Yeah, you know what anyone at watching eyes are.

771
00:48:14,551 --> 00:48:16,922
Rym: Figure skating can keep score too if they know the system.

772
00:48:17,725 --> 00:48:18,509
Scott: I don't know about that.

773
00:48:20,392 --> 00:48:21,816
Scott: Anyway, I don't consider those sports.

774
00:48:22,177 --> 00:48:27,158
Rym: All right, so now they're like performances of some side disagree with you And I consider them sports.

775
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:28,690
Rym: sports to me is a very broad.

776
00:48:29,332 --> 00:48:32,584
Scott: I think if you weren't a marching band fanboy, you would not consider it.

777
00:48:32,624 --> 00:48:42,569
Scott: as I point out that I considered cheerleading Which I think is stupid just as much only to support your argument of marching band being actually I'll take everything in the same category and say it is just to hold it up.

778
00:48:42,931 --> 00:48:47,490
Rym: See actually now I just consider sport to be a very broad category and then within that there are subcategories.

779
00:48:47,511 --> 00:48:55,194
Rym: Yeah I mean marching band and figure skating and cheerleading and all that are definitely not in the same category as you know ice hockey But they're still sports.

780
00:48:55,776 --> 00:48:58,144
Scott: Nah, not their athletic performances.

781
00:48:58,164 --> 00:48:59,087
Scott: They're not even athletic.

782
00:48:59,127 --> 00:49:01,194
Scott: It's just a performance Actually, they're very athletic.

783
00:49:01,234 --> 00:49:02,097
Rym: figure skating is.

784
00:49:02,157 --> 00:49:05,730
Rym: it is extremely extremely brutal on the body?

785
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:07,748
Scott: Not any more than dancing.

786
00:49:08,393 --> 00:49:11,890
Rym: Dancing is also extremely difficult and brutal on the body and athletic.

787
00:49:12,411 --> 00:49:14,958
Scott: No, only if you're doing like crazy-ass dance.

788
00:49:15,159 --> 00:49:18,568
Scott: that requires like jumping around or breakdancing or something.

789
00:49:18,849 --> 00:49:21,118
Rym: Wow Anyway, whatever I disagree with you.

790
00:49:21,138 --> 00:49:23,930
Rym: You're entitled to your opinion, but we've rambled about this too long.

791
00:49:24,031 --> 00:49:25,443
Rym: So I think that's the end of the show for tonight.

792
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:40,230
