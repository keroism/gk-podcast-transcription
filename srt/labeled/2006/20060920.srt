1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,777
Scott: It's Wednesday September 20th.

2
00:00:12,038 --> 00:00:13,603
Scott: This is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:13,623 --> 00:00:19,126
Scott: We discuss the anime kimono zoom a. Let's do this.

4
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:27,318
Rym: Finally finally we're back to a normal episode where we're not tired We're not trying to do anything stupid, and I don't have to make a stupid voice.

5
00:00:27,718 --> 00:00:32,177
Rym: Yeah, yeah Okay, and that puzzles.

6
00:00:32,217 --> 00:00:33,644
Rym: Rome is still staring me in the face.

7
00:00:33,845 --> 00:00:35,916
Scott: Oh wow you didn't put it away Did you know I didn't?

8
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,050
Scott: I think you're turning into a rummy.

9
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:40,109
Scott: I mean most of the stuff in that closet is rum.

10
00:00:40,971 --> 00:00:41,734
Rym: Yeah, surprisingly.

11
00:00:41,754 --> 00:00:42,416
Rym: I have a lot of rum.

12
00:00:42,477 --> 00:00:45,810
Rym: however not surprisingly much of it is owned by Scott Johnson.

13
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:48,376
Scott: Well, you know if I did like alcohol.

14
00:00:48,537 --> 00:00:52,810
Scott: You know I think rum would be the alcohol of choice cuz I mean it's sugar.

15
00:00:53,051 --> 00:00:54,117
Scott: What's better than sugar?

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,082
Rym: I don't know.

17
00:00:55,183 --> 00:00:57,373
Rym: I really like whiskey and Various.

18
00:00:57,393 --> 00:01:00,050
Scott: the queue is that that's corn and stuff.

19
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:03,948
Scott: I mean if you're gonna make alcohol out of something it better be sugar or at least fruit.

20
00:01:03,968 --> 00:01:05,394
Rym: well You'd probably a wine drinker.

21
00:01:05,434 --> 00:01:05,976
Rym: You know grapes.

22
00:01:06,418 --> 00:01:07,020
Scott: grapes are good.

23
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,590
Scott: That's good as sugar though sugar is like the pure.

24
00:01:10,192 --> 00:01:11,015
Scott: You know you can't.

25
00:01:11,376 --> 00:01:12,079
Scott: it's tough to beat.

26
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,324
Scott: That's all I can say.

27
00:01:13,464 --> 00:01:14,990
Scott: there's a reason they make candy out of sugar.

28
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:16,648
Scott: All right.

29
00:01:17,571 --> 00:01:19,157
Scott: So what's happening in the news?

30
00:01:19,197 --> 00:01:19,338
Scott: this.

31
00:01:19,418 --> 00:01:20,141
Scott: it was real slow.

32
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:22,510
Scott: There's no real anime and manga comics news out there.

33
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:29,170
Rym: Yeah, my news the only reason I even bring it up is because I was reading slash dot and the sheer number of people who?

34
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:34,250
Rym: Are there misinformed or just stupid about the issue was driving me nuts, but all it's got to his news first all right.

35
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:39,442
Scott: Well about a year ago There was a study called debunking the game rating myth.

36
00:01:39,542 --> 00:01:40,786
Scott: do game ratings matter?

37
00:01:40,907 --> 00:01:55,267
Scott: and they looked at 260 different video games and they compared how well the games were rated in gaming magazines versus How well the games performed in the marketplace how many copies they sold how much money they made and all that.

38
00:01:55,628 --> 00:01:56,430
Rym: so what was the?

39
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,594
Rym: Correlation they gathered.

40
00:01:57,634 --> 00:02:01,430
Scott: well last year they did the study and it turned out that game ratings don't matter.

41
00:02:02,092 --> 00:02:12,376
Scott: So they did the study again this year and instead of doing it with 260 games they did it with 1200 games and You know what the results were.

42
00:02:12,898 --> 00:02:14,685
Scott: no, I don't game ratings don't matter.

43
00:02:14,706 --> 00:02:18,438
Scott: now I know you and you know me.

44
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,526
Scott: you know that we don't really pay attention or care about game ratings.

45
00:02:21,647 --> 00:02:22,670
Scott: one shit in fact.

46
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:32,018
Rym: the Last game rating that was that actually mattered was way back in the day when TIE fighter got 97% in PC gamer.

47
00:02:32,038 --> 00:02:34,809
Rym: that was probably the most accurate rating a game has ever been given.

48
00:02:35,552 --> 00:02:38,924
Scott: Yeah, I'm not saying the game ratings are inaccurate or accurate or whatever.

49
00:02:38,964 --> 00:02:43,070
Scott: I'm just saying that you know People like us tend to not give a shit about them.

50
00:02:43,251 --> 00:02:45,459
Scott: We don't use them to make our purchasing decisions.

51
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:53,570
Rym: honestly the thing is during the early PC gaming era I think a lot of us did look at those ratings because there was no way to try out a lot of PC games before.

52
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,690
Rym: You bought him sort of pirating them, but a lot of your friends didn't have the same games you had.

53
00:02:58,332 --> 00:03:05,590
Rym: So a lot of people would read the reviews of games to figure out what to play and There was really only a few sources of reviews.

54
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:13,990
Rym: So I think a lot of people were influenced whether they realized it or not But I don't think that that has been the case for at least seven or eight years.

55
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,180
Scott: Yeah, well, I mean there is one situation.

56
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:18,090
Scott: I can see myself looking at game reviews.

57
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:26,109
Scott: let's say I was going to buy a game like I don't know a Baseball game a realistic baseball game.

58
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:29,110
Scott: well There's a whole bunch of those and I don't know anything about those games.

59
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:35,050
Scott: So I might look at the reviews of every possible new baseball game this year and compare them.

60
00:03:35,391 --> 00:03:38,927
Scott: The thing is I don't really buy those kinds of games, so I don't look at the review.

61
00:03:38,967 --> 00:03:45,390
Rym: more importantly I would never trust a review by any sort of commercial company because oh no absolutely not.

62
00:03:45,531 --> 00:03:53,803
Rym: It seems that there's a lot of evidence that either the companies often send you know Slightly different versions or they'll send the game along with.

63
00:03:53,843 --> 00:03:57,094
Rym: you know some fancy new toys Right now.

64
00:03:57,175 --> 00:04:00,130
Scott: This is the exactly why I wanted to talk about this news.

65
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:04,130
Scott: Is that game companies think that the ratings are important?

66
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:13,821
Scott: So they're basically bribing and finagling and public relations in all the gaming media into giving them high review scores When the reviews don't actually matter.

67
00:04:13,882 --> 00:04:15,289
Scott: Why are you wasting your time and effort?

68
00:04:16,053 --> 00:04:17,017
Rym: Probably the same reason.

69
00:04:17,038 --> 00:04:19,450
Rym: a lot of people advertise on sites like slash dot.

70
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,129
Rym: I mean the people who are most likely to run adblock.

71
00:04:23,149 --> 00:04:27,924
Scott: I guess I guess but I guess the the ads on slash.

72
00:04:27,964 --> 00:04:33,910
Scott: that though tend to be Ads that people who run adblock even if they saw the ads wouldn't be interested.

73
00:04:34,412 --> 00:04:39,389
Scott: So those ads are actually going to appeal to the person who visits last night without an ad block.

74
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:44,186
Rym: well I think another factor and it may sound funny especially people who don't know a lot about.

75
00:04:44,507 --> 00:04:45,530
Rym: you know webcomics or anything.

76
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:49,123
Rym: But I think penny arcade has single-handedly had a lot to do with this.

77
00:04:49,805 --> 00:05:03,325
Rym: Oh really well for one It's I've found that most serious gamers these days or at least a majority of them seem to get almost all of their gaming Related news or the important stuff from penny arcade.

78
00:05:03,706 --> 00:05:04,690
Rym: at least opinion wise.

79
00:05:06,096 --> 00:05:07,470
Scott: I don't know penny arcade really.

80
00:05:08,032 --> 00:05:09,680
Scott: I think what it is is like.

81
00:05:09,861 --> 00:05:15,301
Scott: I read blogs like joystick Kotaku go Nintendo all that sort of stuff.

82
00:05:15,341 --> 00:05:23,570
Scott: right, but those people they don't give you the information They don't cover every single game, and they don't tell you the release dates of everything and all that stuff.

83
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:27,724
Scott: They just you know they hit the high points and they put out interesting stuff.

84
00:05:27,765 --> 00:05:29,310
Scott: and penny arcade is sort of the same way.

85
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,809
Scott: When there's something to say you know the top story they cover it.

86
00:05:33,231 --> 00:05:47,264
Scott: But I think that most people not me But most gamers out there seem to always go to IGN or GameSpy or whatever website like that To get you know the complete breadth of information on all the games.

87
00:05:47,304 --> 00:05:49,230
Scott: You know what games are coming out this week.

88
00:05:49,531 --> 00:05:50,635
Rym: Oh, yeah for game information.

89
00:05:50,655 --> 00:05:53,304
Rym: I'm talking about purely trying to find out whether a game.

90
00:05:53,324 --> 00:05:54,810
Rym: You've never played is worth playing.

91
00:05:55,131 --> 00:06:05,380
Scott: Hmm, I think another thing is is that we aren't like super video gamers who buy video games every week and play And trade in games constantly.

92
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:05,440
Scott: we

93
00:06:05,501 --> 00:06:05,983
Rym: were we were but

94
00:06:07,892 --> 00:06:23,350
Scott: We were never at the point where we were like going to EB twice a week trading in games buying more beating them in a Couple days and rinsing and repeating we were never like that and people like that I think you know tend to do the game reviews and the IGN a lot more than us who just buy all the hits.

95
00:06:23,812 --> 00:06:28,429
Scott: You know I don't care so much about all the other video games because you know time for them.

96
00:06:29,372 --> 00:06:34,969
Scott: The point is just that video game reviews don't matter and stupid people at game companies think they do.

97
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:41,850
Rym: yeah I was stretching for anything to say because I didn't really care at all about Scott's news Because I haven't looked at a video game review in over a decade.

98
00:06:42,413 --> 00:06:42,655
Rym: I just.

99
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:48,566
Scott: I only looked at the most recent video game review I looked at was in the EGM which he got for free, and I didn't read it.

100
00:06:48,687 --> 00:06:49,350
Scott: I just kind of went.

101
00:06:50,716 --> 00:06:52,223
Rym: It was a terrible magazine.

102
00:06:52,303 --> 00:06:53,830
Scott: It took me five seconds to read the whole mag.

103
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:56,724
Rym: Anyone who pays money for that magazine is just an idiot.

104
00:06:56,744 --> 00:06:57,970
Scott: Yeah, I only got it cuz it's free.

105
00:06:58,211 --> 00:07:00,642
Rym: I mean, it's just there's nothing in it at all.

106
00:07:00,682 --> 00:07:01,686
Rym: It was just worthless.

107
00:07:01,706 --> 00:07:04,558
Scott: There was nothing I didn't already know from the Internet's at all.

108
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:07,330
Scott: there were some pretty pictures and a whole bunch of ads all right.

109
00:07:07,391 --> 00:07:11,539
Rym: So I'll get to my news Which is it actually is something that I was a little bit bothered by.

110
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,009
Rym: now the news and the way it was portrayed was that?

111
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,321
Rym: Vinyl record sales are skyrocketing.

112
00:07:18,542 --> 00:07:20,310
Scott: why no one has a vinyl record player?

113
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,698
Scott: How can that be now?

114
00:07:22,101 --> 00:07:23,610
Rym: the news was that vinyl records are?

115
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,251
Rym: Skyrocketing.

116
00:07:24,552 --> 00:07:44,601
Rym: and then the talk about the news and all the buzz about the news and the articles were implying that this is partly a Revolt against the whole digital music medium where you get a music or a piece of music but you don't own the physical thing to go with it and that the ritual of the Record is the reason that these sales are so high.

117
00:07:44,621 --> 00:07:46,810
Rym: suddenly the kids are rebelling against this new culture.

118
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,580
Scott: Kids are rebelling against the ritual the record.

119
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,908
Scott: we hate the ritual of the record.

120
00:07:49,928 --> 00:08:01,241
Rym: now No, and a lot of the talk went on especially in the slashdot comments about how furthermore records were Superior technology.

121
00:08:01,864 --> 00:08:02,869
Scott: Oh you want to talk about that?

122
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:08,489
Rym: Well, I want to talk about all aspects of this because one the news was completely misrepresented.

123
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,020
Rym: Yes, record sales were up.

124
00:08:11,462 --> 00:08:15,695
Rym: They were all the way up to 1998 levels this year.

125
00:08:15,715 --> 00:08:17,640
Scott: Yeah, which means almost dick.

126
00:08:18,102 --> 00:08:18,623
Rym: furthermore.

127
00:08:18,643 --> 00:08:25,056
Rym: The only records that are selling at all are singles which Singles aren't really selling.

128
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:34,702
Rym: It's just that single sells so poorly that if a record sells like 5,000 copies that's a crazy deal because single no one buys singles anymore.

129
00:08:34,943 --> 00:08:37,269
Scott: Wow, that sounds like comic book sales numbers.

130
00:08:38,013 --> 00:08:38,809
Rym: It really.

131
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:52,350
Rym: We sold 5,000 copies of the white stripe single and that's like such a tiny percentage of record sales and Not many copies of the white stripes album for sold in vinyl at all.

132
00:08:52,892 --> 00:08:56,162
Scott: Yeah, I actually have seen a vinyl white stripes album in a store.

133
00:08:56,263 --> 00:08:58,410
Scott: once it was kind of freaking me out.

134
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:06,870
Rym: I was like, whoa Well, you know this new stuff this one really reeks of a marketing effort to try to get kids to think add vinyl.

135
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,196
Scott: That's what I was gonna say.

136
00:09:08,216 --> 00:09:10,124
Rym: It's hip and cool so that they'll buy it.

137
00:09:10,164 --> 00:09:11,530
Rym: It's kind of how Sudoku got popular.

138
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,807
Rym: They tell everyone that it's popular assuming that people will then buy it because it's popular.

139
00:09:16,349 --> 00:09:18,630
Scott: Yep I think we've talked about this on the show a lot.

140
00:09:18,954 --> 00:09:28,270
Scott: I like the trend of you know A lot of people don't recognize when a news story is actually trying to change the opinion that it professes already exists.

141
00:09:28,852 --> 00:09:34,310
Scott: And I am making my mission to whenever this comes around make it a news story on GeekNights and point it out to you.

142
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:42,393
Scott: And this is I'm 75% sure this is a case of them trying to make vinyl big as opposed to vinyl being big and then Them reporting on it.

143
00:09:42,734 --> 00:09:46,387
Rym: Yeah, I mean the news really made it out like vinyl is having its best year.

144
00:09:46,427 --> 00:09:47,933
Rym: It's skyrocketing It's crazy.

145
00:09:47,953 --> 00:09:51,810
Rym: And no it just did slightly less ass than it's done for the past decade.

146
00:09:52,151 --> 00:09:53,616
Scott: Yeah, which means still crap.

147
00:09:53,656 --> 00:10:05,864
Rym: now before I get a little sweeter before I get to the factual You know objective part about the technology about the technology of vinyl I want to give my opinion as to who buys vinyl.

148
00:10:05,904 --> 00:10:07,330
Rym: This is not based on any research.

149
00:10:07,711 --> 00:10:16,255
Rym: This is based on my opinion based on my anecdotal observations and is based on my assumptions and inferences Based on the data I have seen.

150
00:10:16,275 --> 00:10:16,857
Rym: Mm-hmm.

151
00:10:17,258 --> 00:10:23,405
Rym: The following types of people are the people who buy vinyl one very old people.

152
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:26,959
Scott: Well for us that means 50 plus.

153
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,430
Rym: Yes, very very old people.

154
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,076
Scott: There are people like my parents.

155
00:10:32,116 --> 00:10:36,050
Scott: they buy CDs, you know, I tell them not to and they know but they do it anyway.

156
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:41,230
Scott: But if there was a CD they were going to buy, you know, they still have this nostalgic feel for vinyl.

157
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:45,650
Scott: They have so many vinyls from their younger days like hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them.

158
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:49,777
Scott: And if I was a lot if I was you know alive when they were alive I would also have fun.

159
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:56,741
Scott: I thought you're gonna say if I was alive today No, if I was alive in their age Then I would also have as many vinyls as they have.

160
00:10:56,821 --> 00:11:16,770
Scott: but if they went to a store today And they had a working turntable Which they probably will soon now that I got my dad a new receiver and they saw a vinyl of the CD They were going to buy for about the same price I imagine they might buy the vinyl and consider buying it just for that Nostalgic feeling it gives them, you know that they've had vinyl most of their lives and that's what they like.

161
00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:21,270
Rym: Yes, now I do also think that that constitutes a somewhat small amount of the vinyl purchases.

162
00:11:21,531 --> 00:11:23,179
Scott: Oh, it does consider very small.

163
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:28,879
Rym: second type of person are Breakbeat DJ types.

164
00:11:29,482 --> 00:11:29,603
Scott: Mmm.

165
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:30,830
Scott: I didn't think of them.

166
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:31,331
Scott: That was smart.

167
00:11:31,652 --> 00:11:37,168
Rym: That is the primary market for vinyl today, and I don't know how often I've talked about that.

168
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:49,346
Rym: I'm not going to talk about my opinions of that kind of DJing other than the fact that they buy a lot of vinyl and That's probably one of the last legitimate uses of vinyl.

169
00:11:49,748 --> 00:11:52,702
Scott: Yeah, okay I think we'll leave it at that because what's the concept?

170
00:11:52,722 --> 00:11:54,350
Scott: you would not sway too far after it.

171
00:11:54,390 --> 00:12:04,518
Rym: Yes, now the third group of people who are buying vinyl are people who for whatever reason have decided that it is culturally cool to be retro and they think that it's hip to purchase vinyl.

172
00:12:04,778 --> 00:12:14,382
Rym: and I note that most of the vinyl that is not made for DJs is of Underground indie whatever rock emo and nothing else.

173
00:12:14,723 --> 00:12:15,265
Scott: That's fine.

174
00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:23,121
Rym: They can buy they can you know Style it up all they want but it seems that most of the people who buy it They buy what they'll say.

175
00:12:23,161 --> 00:12:32,750
Rym: they have reasons for buying it But it seems obvious that the only reason they buy Vinyls is so that people will see them buying vinyls and they can talk about their vinyl collection.

176
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,862
Scott: Yeah Another thing is vinyls are real big.

177
00:12:35,285 --> 00:12:39,081
Scott: so, you know You know, you can just now leave them in your house and people lose them.

178
00:12:39,322 --> 00:12:41,210
Rym: Most vinyl sales are singles and they're little.

179
00:12:43,038 --> 00:12:45,578
Scott: Anyway And what is the fourth group?

180
00:12:45,618 --> 00:12:47,870
Scott: the fourth group which you're gonna spend most of the time talking about?

181
00:12:48,452 --> 00:12:52,407
Rym: We have a fourth group the audio files, okay, I wasn't gonna see.

182
00:12:52,427 --> 00:12:53,070
Rym: those aren't people.

183
00:12:53,611 --> 00:12:53,972
Scott: Okay.

184
00:12:54,032 --> 00:12:54,193
Scott: Okay.

185
00:12:54,213 --> 00:12:54,614
Scott: All right.

186
00:12:54,814 --> 00:13:00,990
Rym: The fourth group are the audio files who claim that records sound better now.

187
00:13:01,091 --> 00:13:03,563
Rym: They don't just claim that it sounds better in a subjective.

188
00:13:03,805 --> 00:13:04,850
Rym: I like the sound of it way.

189
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:07,399
Rym: They claim that it is because that that's perfectly okay.

190
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,029
Scott: Some people like the crackling noise, you know, it gives them a thing.

191
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,640
Rym: Oh though to all you audiophile fuckers.

192
00:13:12,861 --> 00:13:29,962
Rym: before I get on to the actual meat of this I want to note that when records started improving in the early days of records audiophiles bitch then saying that those records weren't as good as the earlier records because they had less distortion and it sounded too sterile and cold and mechanical.

193
00:13:30,283 --> 00:13:34,666
Rym: the exact same bullshit arguments You've been making about CDs and debt and everything now.

194
00:13:35,853 --> 00:13:36,195
Scott: Yep.

195
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:36,798
Rym: Yep.

196
00:13:36,838 --> 00:13:37,200
Rym: Yep.

197
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:38,990
Rym: Don't just don't lie to yourselves.

198
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,557
Rym: You got accustomed to a type of sound.

199
00:13:40,577 --> 00:13:41,542
Rym: you like that type of sound.

200
00:13:41,582 --> 00:13:43,771
Rym: you buy vinyl because the vinyl gives you that type Of sound.

201
00:13:44,313 --> 00:13:47,021
Rym: don't pretend that vinyl has higher fidelity.

202
00:13:47,101 --> 00:13:47,663
Rym: It does not.

203
00:13:48,004 --> 00:13:50,050
Rym: it empirically does nots.

204
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:57,649
Rym: There are so many things I can describe and explain as to why vinyl has terrible fidelity compared to CDs.

205
00:13:58,716 --> 00:14:13,375
Scott: Yeah, I mean you could theoretically store digital PCM data on a vinyl record and have a needle that physically feels the pits and converts that to zeros and ones and Generates a perfect wave.

206
00:14:13,997 --> 00:14:16,666
Scott: Okay, but that is not how vinyl works.

207
00:14:16,887 --> 00:14:18,713
Scott: So it doesn't matter One.

208
00:14:19,014 --> 00:14:22,930
Rym: they claim that vinyl has a warmer sound that cannot be reproduced any other way.

209
00:14:23,692 --> 00:14:36,010
Rym: My claim account my counter claim is simply that that sound can be very very easily Recreated digitally because all it is is dynamic distortion and a bunch of noise and hisses and pops.

210
00:14:36,313 --> 00:14:37,322
Rym: It's nothing special.

211
00:14:37,402 --> 00:14:45,282
Scott: a very small Algorithm could turn a perfect CD track into a track You could not distinguish from a vinyl track in a double-blind test.

212
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:58,579
Rym: - they claim that vinyl Because it's an analog medium is not limited in fidelity while CDs and digital media Because of the sampling and the fact that they're digital will sound hard and cold Because they miss out on parts of the audio.

213
00:14:58,841 --> 00:15:00,850
Rym: my counter claim is very simple.

214
00:15:01,391 --> 00:15:07,007
Rym: You can't make a physical medium with a little needle vibrating back and forth that precise.

215
00:15:07,388 --> 00:15:13,646
Rym: you lose most of the high-end to hissing and you can't have sounds below about 30 Hertz because they.

216
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:14,769
Rym: well that.

217
00:15:15,713 --> 00:15:19,810
Rym: So I'm not gonna get in all the technical details because I was about to talk about like five different frequency ranges.

218
00:15:19,991 --> 00:15:24,396
Scott: Yeah, the reason is that if you have a super audio CD I'll shove it up your ass.

219
00:15:24,537 --> 00:15:31,529
Rym: if you have a whole bunch of bass for example And you try to put that on a record it'll knock the needle out of the track.

220
00:15:32,352 --> 00:15:38,267
Rym: Yeah, and in order to overcome the massive hissing and noise you have to use an equalizer.

221
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:44,470
Rym: when you're putting the audio on the Vinyl do super duper amplify the high-end, so it'll even sound it all over the noise.

222
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:53,130
Rym: Now that is the counterclaim to the next argument They make that it's higher fidelity that it actually has better sound quality.

223
00:15:53,432 --> 00:15:56,709
Rym: That is more true to the original sound that you heard in the room.

224
00:15:57,794 --> 00:15:58,949
Rym: That is complete horseshit.

225
00:15:59,971 --> 00:16:00,755
Rym: Vinyl records.

226
00:16:00,796 --> 00:16:07,044
Rym: you might like the way they sound but they do not sound Anymore like what you heard in the room than a good digital recording.

227
00:16:07,325 --> 00:16:08,249
Scott: in fact you know what?

228
00:16:09,437 --> 00:16:16,370
Scott: All my life I would notice this incredibly huge gap between the sound of a live performance and a recorded performance.

229
00:16:16,811 --> 00:16:20,800
Scott: It wasn't until I started getting flack downloads of.

230
00:16:21,832 --> 00:16:34,878
Scott: You know like live recordings and other you know high-quality Superaudio CDs and playing them on my surround sound thing that the drums sound like drums because I have a giant subwoofer but nothing else sounds live.

231
00:16:35,522 --> 00:16:41,250
Scott: and that's with you know a 5.1 surround sound system and a fancy computer and a fancy sound card.

232
00:16:41,631 --> 00:16:48,350
Scott: So there's no way your vinyl which I listen to plenty of vinyl in my life sounds even close To what it sounds like when you're in the recording studio.

233
00:16:48,992 --> 00:16:54,910
Rym: You also in addition to having to you know super equalize the sound by cutting off the bass and pumping up the high-end.

234
00:16:55,473 --> 00:17:01,949
Rym: You have to usually do a whole bunch of tricks to make it sound like anything Rational coming out of that record because the medium is just so horrible.

235
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:08,570
Rym: Finally last and certainly not least records degrade Rapidly.

236
00:17:08,872 --> 00:17:13,143
Rym: the claim that records last longer on the shelf than CDs is complete.

237
00:17:13,163 --> 00:17:13,523
Rym: BS.

238
00:17:13,845 --> 00:17:18,164
Rym: records are so prone to heat damage Moisture damage dust damage.

239
00:17:18,184 --> 00:17:19,109
Rym: you wouldn't think about that.

240
00:17:19,391 --> 00:17:28,130
Rym: But they collect a lot of static electricity and as a result dust Very small dust will get in the grooves and stick to the record in a way that is almost impossible to remove.

241
00:17:28,391 --> 00:17:32,230
Scott: Yeah, that's another thing and you have something that's an analog storage format.

242
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:41,010
Scott: It degrades as in it plays, you know Well, then it plays kind of okay that in fact there were standards for how rapidly records would decay.

243
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,532
Rym: You know what?

244
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:45,022
Rym: There's noticeable decay on the first playing of a record.

245
00:17:45,103 --> 00:17:47,470
Rym: Yep, a noticeable and significant decay.

246
00:17:47,962 --> 00:17:49,895
Scott: However CDs are digital.

247
00:17:49,975 --> 00:17:51,239
Scott: they either work or they don't.

248
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:58,770
Scott: you either hear the sound that's on the CD perfectly or it Skips and a lot of the sound is missing which means it's broken and scratch.

249
00:17:59,193 --> 00:18:01,327
Scott: Those are the only two possibilities of the CD.

250
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:22,670
Rym: now There is one other reason that a lot of people like vinyl and are moving toward vinyl and in fact Well, not a lot of people but these people and this is something that a lot of DJs are doing these days Where they'll make a mix track or something and they'll make a Small dub vinyl usually in a custom shop or in their own home equipment to give to other DJs to use in their mixes.

251
00:18:23,472 --> 00:18:35,919
Rym: They do this in order to make it more difficult for people to take their beats and play them too much Because they're afraid that if their beats are played too much They'll become overplayed and therefore unpopular and stupid.

252
00:18:36,321 --> 00:18:37,424
Scott: if you're an awesome DJ.

253
00:18:37,444 --> 00:18:39,190
Scott: You should be making new beats more often.

254
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:39,571
Scott: That's all.

255
00:18:39,611 --> 00:18:41,457
Rym: no, no, not even that not even that.

256
00:18:41,878 --> 00:18:45,048
Rym: that argument is stupid because they claim.

257
00:18:45,168 --> 00:18:51,649
Rym: Oh, all right So you made this record of your thing and they always say yeah If you try to convert that record to digital you lose something.

258
00:18:52,025 --> 00:18:52,491
Rym: No you don't.

259
00:18:52,812 --> 00:19:01,289
Rym: you can perfectly recreate that first playing if you record it to a good set of digital equipment and then You now have a digital copy that will never degrade again forever.

260
00:19:02,372 --> 00:19:05,246
Rym: It in no way protects your media from anyone copying it.

261
00:19:05,548 --> 00:19:07,612
Rym: Yeah Yeah.

262
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:17,410
Rym: to move on I just want to say that this whole news about vinyl becoming more popular is pretty much complete Horseshit, it is not becoming more popular.

263
00:19:17,751 --> 00:19:19,517
Rym: It just had a slight upswing in sales.

264
00:19:19,717 --> 00:19:32,298
Rym: that is being used by the PR marketing machine to try to get you the youth of America to purchase more vinyl albums when in fact The only people actually purchasing them in any significant quantity are DJ and those the only people who shit.

265
00:19:39,408 --> 00:19:40,590
Rym: hockey fights of the day.

266
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:46,141
Scott: Oh, it's still hockey fight week And I think the hockey has begun as of right now.

267
00:19:46,161 --> 00:19:48,330
Scott: all the preseason hockey has begun now.

268
00:19:48,672 --> 00:19:57,030
Rym: We'll go kind of briefly but the two hockey fights I chose now I chose two today for a very important reason illustrate probably all of the important aspects of hockey fighting now.

269
00:19:57,633 --> 00:20:09,190
Rym: the Detroit Red Wings and the Colorado Avalanche had a Bitter bitter rivalry going on between them, you know, that's one of the big things about hockey is the rivalries between all the teams.

270
00:20:10,391 --> 00:20:12,217
Scott: As in any sport rivalries are key.

271
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:13,983
Rym: Yes, of course in most sports.

272
00:20:14,003 --> 00:20:16,090
Rym: They don't come into straight-up fistfights.

273
00:20:16,978 --> 00:20:17,207
Rym: now.

274
00:20:18,173 --> 00:20:20,801
Rym: the Red Wings and the and the ABS were fighting.

275
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:22,105
Rym: if they were fighting lose.

276
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:32,617
Rym: there's a fight going on and For various reasons Mike Vernon the Red Wings goalie and Patrick Waugh the other goalie charged each other and had a knockdown.

277
00:20:32,778 --> 00:20:33,359
Rym: drag him out.

278
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:42,685
Rym: goalie fight in the middle of this other massive fight where the benches were cleared and The whole time the commentators like what's going on the red the goalies are fighting.

279
00:20:42,725 --> 00:20:44,230
Rym: Yeah, it's crazy.

280
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,116
Rym: Happily Vernon kicks the guy's ass.

281
00:20:47,256 --> 00:20:55,002
Scott: Well, it's super rare for a goalie fight, you know, cuz a goalie is covered in like armor Serious armor, so no one's gonna fight with that guy.

282
00:20:55,023 --> 00:20:57,873
Scott: cuz you're putting even if he's you know Kind of weak relative.

283
00:20:57,933 --> 00:20:59,579
Rym: not only that but think of this.

284
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,995
Rym: the goalie's job is to stand there and get shot by pucks Constantly.

285
00:21:04,398 --> 00:21:06,250
Rym: you think you can punch faster than a puck?

286
00:21:07,012 --> 00:21:09,862
Scott: Yeah, you're not gonna scare him with your fist if you know.

287
00:21:10,725 --> 00:21:12,270
Scott: if he's he's not afraid of pucks.

288
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:14,437
Rym: so they have this big fight and not one.

289
00:21:14,477 --> 00:21:24,410
Rym: the video really illustrates a big big important part about hockey and hockey fights is that If you keep watching the video after the fight cools down a bit You see two guys who had been beating the hell out of each other.

290
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:32,457
Rym: They're both bleeding and broken and they're standing there kind of sitting around hold down to each other and they're not fighting anymore They're talking.

291
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,410
Rym: They're just talking like two dudes.

292
00:21:34,631 --> 00:21:37,402
Rym: They're probably saying man, that was a great fight.

293
00:21:37,984 --> 00:21:43,950
Scott: That's that's how hockey works And that's why fighting is okay in hockey and they don't just arrest everyone for assault and throw them in jail.

294
00:21:44,171 --> 00:21:48,367
Scott: Yeah, like they would if say two basketball or two baseball players got into a fight.

295
00:21:48,427 --> 00:21:49,050
Rym: Of course they do.

296
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:54,709
Rym: I mean there there have been incidents where someone started a hockey fight that was actually completely uncalled for.

297
00:21:55,631 --> 00:21:58,739
Scott: Yeah, but you know when that happens everyone recognizes.

298
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,727
Scott: Oh that guy's really fighting and not hockey fighting.

299
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:02,970
Scott: We better get something about it.

300
00:22:03,252 --> 00:22:09,410
Rym: Usually what they do is if that guy has ever led to play hockey again He gets attacked and pretty much every game he plays until he quits the sport.

301
00:22:09,972 --> 00:22:13,429
Scott: Yeah, you don't want to have you know, it's a self-regulating industry.

302
00:22:13,469 --> 00:22:27,860
Rym: now I'll skip all that because the father important part of everything in the day is that almost exactly one year later Now Chris Osgood who in the previous year was Mike Vernon's jr Is now the Red Wings goalie and Patrick Waugh is still their goalie.

303
00:22:28,382 --> 00:22:44,455
Rym: and sure enough during this big fight Waugh comes out of the on the ice and this ref is trying to hold him back like no You don't want to do this Go back to your side of the rink and sit there and then he kind of misdirects the ref when he's distracted and he charges Chris Osgood and he skates

304
00:22:44,536 --> 00:22:44,716
Scott: around.

305
00:22:44,737 --> 00:22:48,230
Scott: This guy just like wants to have goalie fights probably because he thinks it's like a novelty.

306
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,018
Scott: So he's like I'm gonna be the goalie who fights.

307
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,437
Rym: Well, he was also pissed at Osgood for a number of reasons I won't get into.

308
00:22:53,478 --> 00:22:54,649
Rym: he was also mad at the Red Wings.

309
00:22:55,491 --> 00:22:59,610
Rym: So he's circling around over there and Osgood is still wearing all of his gear.

310
00:22:59,771 --> 00:23:02,200
Rym: He's standing there like I don't want to fight you what the hell.

311
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:08,222
Rym: so finally Osgood's like, all right And he rips his mask off takes his gloves off and skates out.

312
00:23:08,282 --> 00:23:10,750
Rym: now Chris Osgood is about two feet shorter than this guy.

313
00:23:11,051 --> 00:23:12,036
Rym: He's a tiny little dude.

314
00:23:12,056 --> 00:23:12,377
Rym: I met him.

315
00:23:12,397 --> 00:23:13,081
Rym: He's shorter than me.

316
00:23:13,342 --> 00:23:14,949
Rym: He's this tiny tiny little dude.

317
00:23:15,471 --> 00:23:22,130
Rym: He's also I'm pretty sure had never been in a fight in hockey at least not in the NHL up until this point.

318
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:23,980
Scott: Yeah, I mean imagine that not.

319
00:23:24,021 --> 00:23:26,778
Scott: you've been playing hockey for a long time But you were never in a fight.

320
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:33,870
Scott: and then all of a sudden, you know You've been playing for years then all of a sudden a fight and this really big guy comes over to kick your ass.

321
00:23:34,235 --> 00:23:35,010
Scott: That's a scary thing.

322
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:45,470
Rym: Let me tell you Osgood does a classic boxer strategy when someone is longer reach than you he moves in and as close as he Can and absorbs a bunch of blows on purpose trying to get close?

323
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:51,385
Rym: Because the closer you get the less hard the guys hitting you and then he proceeds to thoroughly kick.

324
00:23:51,726 --> 00:23:52,970
Rym: Patrick was ass.

325
00:23:53,613 --> 00:23:54,800
Scott: That's pretty unexpected.

326
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,430
Scott: I mean, you know, you've never been in a fight.

327
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:57,756
Scott: You don't want to be in a fight.

328
00:23:57,797 --> 00:24:02,909
Scott: some guy comes over and challenges you, you know You reluctantly go into a fight and then you win.

329
00:24:03,552 --> 00:24:15,662
Rym: I was watching that game on TV when it happened as a child and you can even hear in this video the entire arena chanting Ozzy Ozzy Yeah, that people will get up if there's a goalie fight.

330
00:24:15,742 --> 00:24:20,645
Rym: people were freaking get excited like no They didn't call the audience that the crowd down for at least 20 minutes.

331
00:24:20,665 --> 00:24:21,449
Rym: It was just chaos.

332
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:27,750
Scott: If I was a goalie in hockey I would if anyone like came and messed with me.

333
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:31,389
Scott: I would start a fight with him because you know if it was if he was worth it.

334
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,523
Scott: You know just because everyone would get all excited that my team would win.

335
00:24:34,644 --> 00:24:36,030
Scott: at least it was at home away.

336
00:24:36,151 --> 00:24:36,853
Scott: I would never do that.

337
00:24:37,436 --> 00:24:40,750
Rym: now before I let Scott go there's one other nice trivia bit about Chris Osgood.

338
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:41,750
Rym: This is very interesting.

339
00:24:42,071 --> 00:24:48,350
Rym: He was the either second or third goalie ever to be credited with a goal scored in the NHL.

340
00:24:48,831 --> 00:24:52,644
Scott: Yeah, I remember Martin Brodeur was like the champion of scoring goals.

341
00:24:52,764 --> 00:24:54,489
Scott: as a goalie he would like go for it.

342
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:57,650
Scott: No, you like other goalies would like it might happen by accident.

343
00:24:57,993 --> 00:25:04,310
Scott: Brodeur used to go for it Like if there was an empty net he would try to get the puck and shoot it all the way down the ice.

344
00:25:04,511 --> 00:25:07,221
Scott: Yep, he did it like two or three times - I think he was.

345
00:25:07,302 --> 00:25:10,410
Rym: I think I'm pretty sure Osgood was if he wasn't the Second person to do it.

346
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:16,469
Rym: He was the second person to do it on purpose and be the single sole person who scored the goal on purpose.

347
00:25:17,251 --> 00:25:18,435
Rym: He saw an opening he shot.

348
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,017
Rym: He got a goal.

349
00:25:19,579 --> 00:25:19,859
Scott: Mm-hmm.

350
00:25:20,381 --> 00:25:23,010
Scott: Yeah goalies have gotten plenty of assists in the day.

351
00:25:23,435 --> 00:25:24,470
Scott: Yeah, okay.

352
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:33,983
Scott: So this hockey fight which I present to you today is a classic not so much because of the fight itself Even though the hockey fight itself is quite a marvel to behold.

353
00:25:34,204 --> 00:25:38,077
Rym: Yes, if you've ever seen Family Guy Hoedown hootenanny, hoedown hootenanny.

354
00:25:38,178 --> 00:25:39,121
Rym: It is that kind of fight.

355
00:25:39,462 --> 00:25:41,229
Scott: That is exactly what this fight is.

356
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:44,741
Scott: and What makes it more entertaining is the announcer.

357
00:25:45,022 --> 00:25:51,930
Scott: now the guy isn't that great of an announcer But when this fight starts he goes, you know, the two guys fighting are Tasker and Sen.

358
00:25:52,071 --> 00:25:53,302
Scott: I don't know what teams they're on.

359
00:25:53,322 --> 00:25:54,109
Scott: I don't really care.

360
00:25:54,420 --> 00:26:00,210
Rym: You know I've only seen this fight on the internet a million times because it's widely regarded on the internet is the best hockey fight ever.

361
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:11,190
Scott: yeah, and Basically the guy starts, you know when he's announcing he's like tasker with a right Sen with a right Tasker with another right a right and a right and a right and right and right and right and it's just hilarious.

362
00:26:11,391 --> 00:26:13,837
Scott: But because they are is they're basically both.

363
00:26:14,459 --> 00:26:23,824
Scott: each guy is holding the other guy's jersey with his left hand and then throwing haymakers Repeatedly and rapidly directly into the face of the other guy.

364
00:26:23,844 --> 00:26:25,110
Rym: They're all connecting.

365
00:26:25,231 --> 00:26:28,594
Rym: It's just BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM And they're both hitting.

366
00:26:28,634 --> 00:26:32,730
Scott: they're swinging it exactly the same speed and power just over and over again.

367
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:35,630
Scott: Just punch to the face punch to the face punch to the face punch to the edges.

368
00:26:35,931 --> 00:26:41,327
Rym: It's so great and you can see their faces becoming more and more bloodied and purple as this.

369
00:26:41,447 --> 00:26:44,082
Scott: it's like these guys But you know, they kind of size each other up.

370
00:26:44,123 --> 00:26:49,824
Scott: They take the gloves off You know, they're putting up the Dukes and their faces are nice and well as nice as hockey.

371
00:26:49,904 --> 00:26:51,710
Scott: hockey players faces can be fighters.

372
00:26:51,951 --> 00:26:55,726
Scott: Yeah hockey players faces are yeah without teeth or anything.

373
00:26:55,766 --> 00:27:05,968
Scott: and then you know They just go wham wham wham and the faces just turn red and then purple and then god knows I wouldn't know what have been either one of these guys, but I love watching them.

374
00:27:07,131 --> 00:27:08,863
Scott: It's just like the best hockey fight.

375
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:13,397
Scott: You got to see it All right, anyway on to the main bit.

376
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:16,810
Rym: today we're going to go back to our traditional actually reviewing anime.

377
00:27:17,891 --> 00:27:19,818
Scott: Oh my god, you're reviewing an anime.

378
00:27:19,858 --> 00:27:21,083
Scott: I wonder who's gonna be happy.

379
00:27:21,103 --> 00:27:22,427
Scott: our listeners.

380
00:27:22,468 --> 00:27:32,850
Scott: Hooray Okay, the anime we chose to review today is called Kemo nozume and I think Rym wants to avoid saying the name out of fear of saying it improperly.

381
00:27:33,091 --> 00:27:37,470
Rym: Actually, just cuz I didn't write it down in front of me and I can't easily use my computer while I do the show.

382
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:43,190
Scott: Yes, Kemo nozume is a brand new show this season and we watched two episodes.

383
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,102
Scott: This is like a two episode review here.

384
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:46,290
Rym: Yeah, and there are two episodes out.

385
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:51,830
Rym: So it's more of a preview than a review, but I have high hopes for the show and I'm going to watch it all.

386
00:27:52,031 --> 00:27:54,723
Scott: Yeah, I'm almost definitely going to keep watching the show.

387
00:27:54,743 --> 00:28:02,189
Scott: There's a 90% chance I'll watch it all but it is possible that somehow the show could take a wrong turn and end up God knows where.

388
00:28:02,209 --> 00:28:09,926
Rym: now It's directed by a Masaki Yuasa who as far as I can tell Hasn't done anything of note other than be a key animator all over the place.

389
00:28:10,509 --> 00:28:20,577
Scott: Yeah I mean, it looks like he's done, you know a few shows and he's been like an episode director or you know a Storyboard guy or a layout guy.

390
00:28:20,597 --> 00:28:25,290
Rym: I think he designed a character here and there but this is the first show where he really it's all.

391
00:28:25,651 --> 00:28:26,613
Rym: This is his show.

392
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:30,644
Scott: He's directed like two movies, but this is his TV show.

393
00:28:30,664 --> 00:28:31,627
Scott: He's the director.

394
00:28:31,887 --> 00:28:34,155
Scott: He wrote some scripts He directed some episodes.

395
00:28:34,195 --> 00:28:35,078
Scott: He did storyboards.

396
00:28:35,118 --> 00:28:36,202
Scott: He's all over this show.

397
00:28:36,362 --> 00:28:38,149
Scott: This is basically belongs to him.

398
00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:40,696
Scott: and As part of what studio?

399
00:28:40,736 --> 00:28:41,941
Scott: madhouse, I think right?

400
00:28:42,402 --> 00:28:42,623
Scott: Yep.

401
00:28:42,724 --> 00:28:44,290
Scott: It's a it's a madhouse production.

402
00:28:45,074 --> 00:28:48,110
Scott: Those are the same people who brought you all sorts of other awesome shows.

403
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:54,610
Rym: Now the the main notable things because if the show had been presented any other way it probably wouldn't have been so good.

404
00:28:54,690 --> 00:29:05,523
Rym: but it's a combination really of the style of animation the presentation of the plot and The the elements that are in the show as a result of this plot a monkey.

405
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,390
Rym: Yeah, I was gonna get to the monkey.

406
00:29:07,531 --> 00:29:08,858
Rym: Okay, doo doo doo doo doo.

407
00:29:11,452 --> 00:29:14,105
Rym: And I had a third thing but Scott won't shut up about the monkey.

408
00:29:14,266 --> 00:29:15,170
Scott: we the monkey.

409
00:29:15,932 --> 00:29:17,622
Rym: Let me just say that the show has a monkey in it.

410
00:29:17,642 --> 00:29:18,930
Rym: We'll get to that in a moment.

411
00:29:19,611 --> 00:29:20,195
Scott: Yes, we will.

412
00:29:20,416 --> 00:29:22,770
Rym: now the plot is actually very simple though.

413
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,637
Rym: First of all, the opener is very stylized.

414
00:29:25,657 --> 00:29:30,430
Rym: the moment you start watching this show you realize that this is not like other anime.

415
00:29:31,232 --> 00:29:43,050
Scott: yeah, the opener kind of reminds me of the cowboy bebop opener a little bit in like the way the colors are used and the Way, you know that it like breaks it up into panels and the style of music a little bit.

416
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,440
Rym: I really like the opening song.

417
00:29:44,581 --> 00:29:45,749
Scott: Yeah, it's it's a good song.

418
00:29:46,232 --> 00:29:55,144
Scott: It's all jazzy and hip and cool and everything unlike a lot of other, you know Typical j-rock j-pop, you know idol openers or the.

419
00:29:55,164 --> 00:29:57,110
Scott: you know, boring atmospheric opener.

420
00:29:57,571 --> 00:30:03,029
Scott: This is actually, you know something I'd want to listen to and it's I won't skip over the opener every time I watch the show.

421
00:30:03,785 --> 00:30:21,848
Rym: Yep now it starts up with this pretty boy and this ugly guy sitting in some fancy fancy club and they're sitting there talking and the Pretty boy is talking about his taste in women and he likes the younger girls and he gets them all the time and he keeps talking and the more he talks it starts getting more and more disturbing.

422
00:30:21,868 --> 00:30:26,603
Rym: and Finally in the end you realize that he's not talking about sexual con.

423
00:30:26,684 --> 00:30:28,690
Scott: Oh, yeah, we're gonna spoil like the first episode.

424
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:36,998
Rym: Yeah, he is talking about killing and eating them because he is in fact a Shoku jinky a monster yep, a flesh eater.

425
00:30:37,078 --> 00:30:46,930
Scott: the story of this world is that there are people and They're also flesh eaters these horrid monsters from ancient times that eat people.

426
00:30:47,773 --> 00:30:52,650
Scott: Yep, and there is a group of swordsmen the key fukan the key fukan.

427
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,857
Scott: They have the key fukan technique or the key.

428
00:30:55,018 --> 00:30:57,205
Scott: I don't know whatever you want to call it style.

429
00:30:57,365 --> 00:30:59,492
Scott: Yeah key fukan style whatever.

430
00:30:59,974 --> 00:31:05,029
Scott: and these are swordsmen martial artists who basically their job is to fight flesh eaters.

431
00:31:05,049 --> 00:31:08,540
Scott: and You know occasionally I like how.

432
00:31:09,062 --> 00:31:13,760
Scott: it's never actually about the fight, you know Like other fighting shows it'd be like oh, here's a fight.

433
00:31:14,262 --> 00:31:17,655
Scott: in this show fights are just kind of like yeah They kill the flesh eater.

434
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:18,439
Scott: Oh look here.

435
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:19,524
Scott: They are fighting a flesh eater.

436
00:31:19,564 --> 00:31:20,730
Scott: It doesn't happen too often.

437
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:27,590
Scott: It's mostly about the lives of people whose job it is to fight flesh eaters because they treat it like a straight-up job.

438
00:31:27,771 --> 00:31:30,399
Rym: I mean, it's literally this nine-to-five thing for these guys.

439
00:31:30,941 --> 00:31:33,890
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, they'll just be out in the field casually.

440
00:31:34,151 --> 00:31:36,579
Scott: You know, there's a monster they chase it down.

441
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,004
Scott: They use their weapons on it.

442
00:31:38,065 --> 00:31:39,289
Scott: They kill it and there you go.

443
00:31:39,891 --> 00:31:45,330
Rym: Now it turns out that the ancient flesh eaters were somewhat different from the ones today.

444
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:50,110
Rym: And now there's this new kind of flesh eater that's appeared that looks just like a human.

445
00:31:50,552 --> 00:31:54,490
Rym: And in fact when you kill them they turn back into humans and there's no way to know they were once a flesh eater.

446
00:31:55,431 --> 00:32:01,920
Scott: Yeah, and it gets kind of tricky because you know, they'll be walking down the street They'll be a person and they might not know the person's a flesh eater.

447
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:03,746
Scott: and then oh someone got eaten.

448
00:32:04,168 --> 00:32:04,750
Scott: What are you gonna do?

449
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:10,330
Rym: Now if that were just it the show would have been okay because it's got this interesting style and this interesting plot.

450
00:32:11,032 --> 00:32:17,090
Rym: But before we talk about the plot further First there is this scene with a monkey.

451
00:32:18,651 --> 00:32:20,880
Scott: Well, it's basically the second half of the first episode.

452
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,530
Scott: the second half of both episodes was the monkey.

453
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:29,130
Rym: Yeah, so far the monkey is really kind of there in a big way in every episode.

454
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:31,278
Scott: It's like we're watching the first episode halfway through.

455
00:32:31,298 --> 00:32:33,707
Scott: this monkey shows up and he's there until the end of the episode.

456
00:32:33,747 --> 00:32:39,690
Scott: the second episode The monkey shows up halfway through the episode and he keeps poking his head in until the end of the episode.

457
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:43,750
Scott: I think the monkey is like he takes over in the second half of every episode.

458
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:46,902
Rym: I cannot spoil for you what the monkey does.

459
00:32:47,283 --> 00:32:53,769
Rym: watch the first episode of this show And once you see the monkey know that something awesome is about to happen.

460
00:32:54,050 --> 00:33:06,827
Scott: The monkey is high Larry's as any so cute to the way they draw him and if you go to the official Japanese website This is really cute Like 3d animation of the monkey where when like you hover over the menu items the monkey like changes his pose.

461
00:33:07,348 --> 00:33:07,870
Scott: It's so great.

462
00:33:08,914 --> 00:33:21,450
Rym: Now in addition to that the monkey I mean the monkey pushed the show from pretty good - I have to watch all this by itself Mmm, but also so they fight this flesh eater and they kill it the you know, the pretty boy who was killing the girls.

463
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:22,734
Scott: Oh that reminds me the.

464
00:33:23,175 --> 00:33:27,368
Scott: the name of the show is kenno music a kimonos kimono zoom.

465
00:33:27,428 --> 00:33:32,224
Scott: a good job Yeah, and that apparently means like monster claw or something like that.

466
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:33,568
Rym: I believe it was Emily who told us that.

467
00:33:33,648 --> 00:33:38,050
Scott: yes, and The way they kill these monsters is by cutting the hands off.

468
00:33:38,218 --> 00:33:40,075
Rym: Yes Their claws are very powerful like.

469
00:33:40,095 --> 00:33:48,944
Rym: that's the source of their power and that plays a lot into how they animate the flesh eaters later - yeah, it's like the claws is like where the mo it's like the weak point.

470
00:33:49,044 --> 00:34:00,550
Scott: if you were fighting them in a video game you would shoot all your bullets at the claws and When people who are actually flesh eaters in disguise Transforming the flesh eaters like the hands are the first part to turn into claws, you know.

471
00:34:00,711 --> 00:34:09,072
Rym: Now if you look at the cover art for the show You can see that drawn out very explicitly when it shows a girl who is beginning the transformation Mm-hmm.

472
00:34:09,534 --> 00:34:12,524
Rym: Now the other point in which the show became awesome is so far.

473
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:20,429
Rym: It's animated in this really I don't want to say low-budget, but just really interesting style where the characters are all kind of ugly.

474
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:24,007
Scott: Yeah, well, it kind of reminds me a little of doctor cats and that you have these.

475
00:34:24,168 --> 00:34:30,630
Scott: non They're not like these clear super pristine lines that you get in most other anime these days.

476
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:41,389
Scott: they're kind of wiggly and moving and no care, you know, every character is identifiable by their hairstyle and their Complexion and the size and shape of their body, but they're not static.

477
00:34:41,471 --> 00:34:48,302
Scott: They're kind of you know moving around and you know They're not always drawn with the exact same lines in the exact same place.

478
00:34:48,924 --> 00:34:55,350
Scott: and it kind of also reminds you that windy tales Anime, yeah, I think that's the only other animation I've ever seen that's like this.

479
00:34:56,411 --> 00:34:58,241
Rym: Now there's so so far the show goes on.

480
00:34:58,281 --> 00:34:59,970
Rym: they they have this fight with the flesh eater.

481
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:06,830
Rym: Now the main character toshihiko who is the like master of the style other than the father who actually runs the school?

482
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,734
Rym: He has a problem.

483
00:35:09,317 --> 00:35:15,550
Rym: whenever he is about to put the killing blow down on a flesh eater He gets crippling stomach cramps and diarrhea.

484
00:35:16,251 --> 00:35:20,750
Scott: Yeah, the way they animate it is pretty hilarious, but it they never really explained why it happened.

485
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:23,927
Rym: But the thing is it happens and everyone we've shown the show to goes.

486
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:24,470
Rym: what?

487
00:35:25,371 --> 00:35:26,970
Rym: Why did they just show what's going on?

488
00:35:27,951 --> 00:35:31,122
Rym: Right away in the next scene the the one of these guys walks over.

489
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:33,450
Rym: he's like man you always have diarrhea.

490
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,654
Rym: We're just when you can.

491
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:39,090
Scott: I know it's like he can't control his bowels when he's about to kill a flesh eater.

492
00:35:39,491 --> 00:35:40,193
Scott: I don't know what's wrong.

493
00:35:40,654 --> 00:35:46,972
Scott: I think it's going to be a major plot point later on but in the meantime, it's strange yet hilarious Yep.

494
00:35:47,334 --> 00:35:53,140
Rym: So anyway after the fight now, they beat this flesh eater and they go back to the school and they're talking about yes Flesh eaters are back.

495
00:35:53,382 --> 00:35:53,543
Rym: Now.

496
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:54,350
Rym: We have a purpose.

497
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,518
Rym: We're going to go do our thing and save people.

498
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,815
Rym: and then the other main male I guess the.

499
00:36:00,895 --> 00:36:04,793
Rym: I forget his name, but the silver haired guy who was kind of a silver haired guy I think is his brother.

500
00:36:04,813 --> 00:36:06,238
Scott: Yes stepbrother.

501
00:36:06,298 --> 00:36:06,719
Scott: Who knows?

502
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,582
Rym: Well, no, he's the.

503
00:36:07,662 --> 00:36:13,013
Rym: I think he's a legitimate brother or the legitimate heir At least and toshihiko seems to be adopted Uh-huh.

504
00:36:13,113 --> 00:36:17,390
Rym: I wouldn't be surprised if toshihiko were a flesh eater and didn't know it or something weird like that.

505
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:19,139
Scott: I don't know either what's good.

506
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:19,662
Rym: I got a lot of.

507
00:36:19,762 --> 00:36:21,190
Rym: I got a lot of speculation about it.

508
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:26,330
Scott: It seems to be though that most of the family is able to like detect a flesh eater even if they're in disguise.

509
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:31,250
Scott: You know, it's like they just kind of know and they can figure it out real quick because that's what they've been doing for centuries

510
00:36:32,152 --> 00:36:56,149
Rym: Yep, but they're having this talk about you know fighting the flesh eaters and suddenly this guy and like one of his subordinates they start an argument and they stand up and they actually Have ready and waiting a 3d PowerPoint style presentation showing how this giant robot Powered armor that this guy is designed is the way to really fight these things and this pussy sword technique is Useless and they should get rid of it and use this robot.

511
00:36:56,169 --> 00:36:57,381
Scott: Yeah Well see part of that.

512
00:36:57,543 --> 00:37:00,218
Scott: if there's two Sides to that there's actually three sides.

513
00:37:00,278 --> 00:37:00,579
Scott: kind of.

514
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,929
Rym: I really felt like Daryl Surratt when I was saying that part cuz.

515
00:37:02,949 --> 00:37:03,953
Rym: that's the kind Of thing he would say.

516
00:37:04,033 --> 00:37:07,770
Scott: Yeah, is that the toshihiko guy who's gonna like inherit the family?

517
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:12,245
Scott: Whatever he actually is better at sorting than anyone else.

518
00:37:12,526 --> 00:37:18,330
Rym: despite his diarrhea He's pretty much better at sorting than everyone else in the family combined except for the father.

519
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:23,969
Scott: So this guy who's second best at sorting is, you know, he wants to get with the roboting.

520
00:37:24,009 --> 00:37:24,350
Scott: instead.

521
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,057
Scott: He's like you're better at sorting.

522
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:26,880
Scott: That doesn't mean anything.

523
00:37:26,941 --> 00:37:29,250
Scott: I'll do roboting and my roboting will beat your sorting.

524
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:30,119
Scott: this is what I can do.

525
00:37:30,139 --> 00:37:33,237
Scott: and There's another aspect is he's kind of an ass.

526
00:37:33,277 --> 00:37:38,957
Scott: when he does this the character reminds me very much of sayonji from utana Kinda, yeah a little bit.

527
00:37:39,037 --> 00:37:41,090
Scott: Well the way that guy from gassaraki like that?

528
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,970
Scott: Yeah, like the younger brother who's kind of like girl.

529
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,917
Scott: Why is the older brother so much better?

530
00:37:45,937 --> 00:37:49,690
Rym: just sayonji in terms of the way he talks and the ways inflection and the way he?

531
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:50,393
Rym: Holds himself.

532
00:37:50,614 --> 00:37:52,945
Scott: Yeah, he's being kind of an ass.

533
00:37:52,986 --> 00:37:58,250
Rym: but on the third He's arrogant because he's actually kind of self-conscious.

534
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:58,689
Scott: Yeah.

535
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:00,998
Scott: But the third point is that he's kind of right.

536
00:38:01,038 --> 00:38:04,630
Scott: the robot does kick ass and it'll probably kill a lot more flesh-eaters than swords.

537
00:38:04,691 --> 00:38:06,345
Scott: Well, you know go with the robot.

538
00:38:06,386 --> 00:38:09,322
Rym: Whoo-hoo Yeah, but then that you know the father.

539
00:38:09,363 --> 00:38:11,595
Rym: they always say things like ah But you don't understand.

540
00:38:11,635 --> 00:38:19,629
Rym: and they actually make a point of talking about how the name of their style Has many meanings and one of the meanings is keeping your inner demons contained.

541
00:38:21,931 --> 00:38:26,084
Scott: Yeah, so perhaps using the robot would be putting the demons in the robot and not containing them.

542
00:38:26,124 --> 00:38:31,450
Rym: or maybe because I always have I'm The one always puts forth the crazy guests at the beginning of like every show before I know anything.

543
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:36,806
Rym: Maybe everyone has the potential to be a flesh eater and everyone has that darkness in their heart.

544
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:37,910
Rym: and that's the point of the whole.

545
00:38:38,091 --> 00:38:40,260
Rym: Oh god, that's my that's.

546
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,545
Scott: we would have seen that coming.

547
00:38:41,566 --> 00:38:44,581
Scott: Yeah You know who would have Rym on GeekNights?

548
00:38:44,641 --> 00:38:45,305
Scott: Yeah, that's right.

549
00:38:45,345 --> 00:38:46,008
Rym: I got it right here.

550
00:38:46,952 --> 00:38:53,179
Scott: So anyway, the main plot of the show now, this is a spoiler for the first episode But it is not a spoiler for the show.

551
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:53,743
Scott: It is basically.

552
00:38:53,803 --> 00:38:57,188
Scott: if this show came out This is what would be on the back of the DVD.

553
00:38:57,269 --> 00:39:06,753
Rym: Yes We're not going to ruin what happens in the second episode when that plot gets resolved in terms of you wonder Which way the show is gonna go once we explain what like

554
00:39:06,793 --> 00:39:12,517
Scott: episode 1 tells you what the show is about and episode 2 shows you how The show is gonna be about that.

555
00:39:12,598 --> 00:39:15,512
Rym: cuz they could have gone in all sorts of directions It could have.

556
00:39:16,274 --> 00:39:23,289
Rym: now toshihiko is really frustrated because of his bowel problems his brother problems and there's a girl a really cool girl Although there's the monkey.

557
00:39:24,212 --> 00:39:24,855
Rym: Yeah, there's the monkey.

558
00:39:24,915 --> 00:39:27,790
Rym: I'm not gonna talk about how we you know, I'm not gonna ruin the monkey plot point.

559
00:39:28,031 --> 00:39:31,130
Rym: All right, I was talking about him and the reason he's kind of distraught.

560
00:39:31,672 --> 00:39:38,349
Rym: There's a girl that he was betrothed to when he was young and it looks like it was an arranged marriage that was canceled and She likes it and he doesn't like it.

561
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:45,032
Rym: Yeah Well, he is just devoted to the sword and she likes him and she's also devoted to the school and the sword to a degree But not as much.

562
00:39:45,293 --> 00:39:51,919
Scott: she likes him and he doesn't like her and it was an arranged marriage and everyone else seems to want them To get married except for him.

563
00:39:52,141 --> 00:39:53,550
Scott: toshihiko doesn't want to get married.

564
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:57,703
Scott: So even though his wife is you know supposed supposed to be wife does so.

565
00:39:57,803 --> 00:40:04,323
Rym: one thing leads to another and he is almost landed on By this parachuting woman named Yuka who is in terms of this animation.

566
00:40:04,383 --> 00:40:06,750
Rym: She is obviously in a very beautiful woman.

567
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:08,730
Scott: He's obviously some hot blonde chick.

568
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:17,396
Rym: She is she's presented and drawn as incredibly beautiful and he falls in love with her immediately and she obviously At first sight has feelings for him.

569
00:40:18,018 --> 00:40:20,867
Scott: Yep, and then you know things go.

570
00:40:20,887 --> 00:40:27,610
Rym: now at this point The first thing I thought when I saw this woman's face was there is no way on this green earth that she is not a flesh.

571
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,356
Scott: Yeah, well it says that in.

572
00:40:29,517 --> 00:40:31,283
Scott: yeah, that's what the show is about.

573
00:40:31,343 --> 00:40:41,150
Scott: is a guy who fights flesh eaters Randomly by chance falls in love with a flesh eater without knowing it, but then he knows later and you know stuff happens.

574
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:41,932
Rym: Well, the thing is the.

575
00:40:42,113 --> 00:40:44,499
Rym: the first episode ends on they.

576
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,502
Rym: he's met this woman.

577
00:40:45,823 --> 00:40:46,986
Rym: They end up being together.

578
00:40:47,367 --> 00:40:58,590
Rym: They're in his bedroom They're making love and then there's a flash because there's a storm going outside and as soon as the lightning flashes her mouth She starts to transform a little bit and then she goes back to normal.

579
00:40:58,751 --> 00:41:02,464
Scott: Yeah, she kind of contains it so that he doesn't know he's a little preoccupied.

580
00:41:02,565 --> 00:41:13,997
Rym: Yes, so he doesn't notice He's quite preoccupied, but she is obviously trying to resist the fact that she is about to transform into a partial flesh eater Yep, or a complete flesh eater and then eat him Yeah, and then the episode ends.

581
00:41:14,358 --> 00:41:19,969
Rym: and I don't want to ruin anything about what happens after but I think it's obvious that the show Could have gone in any number of directions from that point.

582
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:24,163
Scott: Yes The direction that it will go in is determined in the second episode and beyond.

583
00:41:24,183 --> 00:41:24,725
Scott: that we don't know.

584
00:41:24,806 --> 00:41:24,966
Scott: cuz.

585
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:27,423
Scott: no no episodes are out yet, so what can we tell you?

586
00:41:28,109 --> 00:41:29,629
Rym: I Really like this show.

587
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:41,129
Rym: I mean pretty much the shows right now that I really like are Nana or on high school host club and Possibly the new mushishi probably the new mushishi and this show right here.

588
00:41:41,537 --> 00:41:52,569
Scott: Yeah this show right here is definitely what I'm looking forward to and the new death note is coming in October 3rd is when episode 1 is To have an opinion on that because I'm worried that it won't be good.

589
00:41:53,012 --> 00:41:54,481
Scott: I am hopeful that it will be good.

590
00:41:54,501 --> 00:41:58,650
Scott: at the very least It'll be some cool animation of Ryuk which will make me happy.

591
00:41:59,051 --> 00:42:04,810
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I guess my problem is the death note is almost entirely people thinking about things a lot.

592
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:06,317
Scott: Yeah, I'm wondering what they're gonna do.

593
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:09,370
Scott: I'm thinking of watching it with the manga in front of me to compare.

594
00:42:10,754 --> 00:42:25,304
Scott: You know like I won't do that the first time I watch it But like I'll watch episode 1 again While holding the manga to see if they do things in the same order or if they leave things out and all that sort of stuff, but anyway, yeah Kemo Nozomi very cool show.

595
00:42:25,384 --> 00:42:26,390
Scott: you should definitely watch it.

596
00:42:26,611 --> 00:42:30,069
Scott: It's about a guy who fights flesh eaters who ends up going out with a flesh eater.

597
00:42:31,512 --> 00:42:32,778
Rym: The show is really neat.

598
00:42:33,442 --> 00:42:34,930
Rym: I don't care what kind of anime you like.

599
00:42:35,392 --> 00:42:40,290
Rym: I think there's a chance you'll like this because it doesn't really fit into a lot of the other stereotypes of anime.

600
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:51,579
Scott: Yeah, this seems to me more like the thing that would have ended up as a very cool Manga that I would buy every volume of sort of like monster a little bit You know, but it ended up as an anime.

601
00:42:51,619 --> 00:42:54,549
Scott: so way to go awesome and there isn't a manga for it.

602
00:42:55,071 --> 00:42:58,830
Rym: Plus there are only two episodes out and it's very easy to get on anime ski.

603
00:42:59,151 --> 00:43:02,610
Scott: Yep, so go get these episodes and watch them for awesome.

604
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:07,927
Scott: I mean, even if you don't care about fighting monsters or drama of dating a monster.

605
00:43:07,947 --> 00:43:08,990
Scott: There's a cute monkey.

606
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:10,755
Scott: You gotta watch for the monkey.

607
00:43:11,036 --> 00:43:13,042
Rym: Yes, if nothing else the monkey is.

608
00:43:13,443 --> 00:43:15,188
Rym: the monkey is worth the rest of the show.

609
00:43:15,228 --> 00:43:16,310
Rym: so far Yeah.

610
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:20,884
Scott: So even if you hate the rest of the show the style makes you nauseous and all that.

611
00:43:21,385 --> 00:43:23,818
Scott: at least watch the first episode For the monkey.

612
00:43:24,504 --> 00:43:26,473
Scott: All right Got anything.

613
00:43:26,594 --> 00:43:27,739
Scott: I think we got some meta bits.

614
00:43:27,819 --> 00:43:30,390
Rym: actually we have meta bits a few like what?

615
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,930
