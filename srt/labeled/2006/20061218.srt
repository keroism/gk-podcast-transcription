Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:28,379
Rym: I Can't express to the masses out there The teaming mass is listening to the show how great it was to have a weekend where I didn't have to do anything, but relax.

6
00:00:29,617 --> 00:00:33,716
Scott: Oh Man, I slept until there were two digits on the clock.

7
00:00:33,816 --> 00:00:35,142
Scott: That was the awesome Yeah.

8
00:00:35,424 --> 00:00:42,736
Scott: at the first half of the clock the second half of the clock, whatever The second half of the clock is always two digits, even if one of them might be a zero.

9
00:00:42,957 --> 00:00:47,219
Rym: now Saturday I woke up when I wanted to wake up and then we spent the whole day playing board games.

10
00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:52,936
Scott: It was a good day interspersed only by ice hockey also eating out one time.

11
00:00:53,157 --> 00:00:55,998
Rym: Oh, yeah, we did eat out Yep, and we did a little bit of shopping.

12
00:00:57,542 --> 00:00:59,006
Scott: We went to Staples didn't buy anything.

13
00:00:59,066 --> 00:00:59,307
Rym: Yeah.

14
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:03,640
Rym: Yeah, that's the closest shopping as we ever get and we didn't go to the clothing store.

15
00:01:04,102 --> 00:01:05,908
Rym: Yeah, well we tried to but then we saw those.

16
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:11,087
Rym: see we keep forgetting that there's this Jesus holiday Christmas And all the festivities around it.

17
00:01:11,107 --> 00:01:20,338
Scott: Yeah, I remember last year there was a date and on that date We said we're not going up that road until the next year because it's not worth it with all these crazy people.

18
00:01:20,378 --> 00:01:24,000
Rym: and in Rochester We used to do that every year pretty much right after Thanksgiving.

19
00:01:24,161 --> 00:01:27,755
Rym: We would not go to the mall under any circumstances until the day after New Year's.

20
00:01:28,196 --> 00:01:30,040
Scott: but well We didn't go to the mall.

21
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,120
Scott: But we definitely went up the road and got real close to the mall closer than we've been in a long time.

22
00:01:35,602 --> 00:01:39,959
Rym: The stores are just crazy like we couldn't even shop at other places because it just wasn't worth it.

23
00:01:40,281 --> 00:01:41,164
Scott: No, definitely not.

24
00:01:41,546 --> 00:01:43,795
Scott: I didn't even get to go to the GameStop and use the gift card.

25
00:01:43,835 --> 00:01:45,826
Rym: I get all right You got that gift card.

26
00:01:46,128 --> 00:01:46,813
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna go get.

27
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:52,371
Scott: metal slug is Probably the first day that it's not stupid crazy to go to a GameStop.

28
00:01:52,592 --> 00:01:55,039
Scott: Yeah, and then I'm probably not gonna go to GameStop again.

29
00:01:56,141 --> 00:01:57,250
Scott: Read today's penny arcade.

30
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,036
Scott: You'll find out why.

31
00:01:58,056 --> 00:02:05,760
Rym: yeah And Sunday was doubly awesome since I. finally I watched the end of Gundam seed again and Emily saw it for the first time.

32
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:23,237
Scott: Yeah, you know when you don't watch an anime or you watch it one time you get the general gist of how it ended But you forget the details and I walked in for like two seconds at a critical moment and I remembered this Small detail that is crazy awesome about the end of that show.

33
00:02:23,257 --> 00:02:26,168
Rym: Yeah Oh, yeah, holy shit cuz.

34
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:31,492
Rym: I forgot about a lot of things and I remembered things that happen But I forgot how absolutely intense they were.

35
00:02:31,512 --> 00:02:32,015
Rym: Yep.

36
00:02:32,356 --> 00:02:37,000
Rym: It's not just anime It's basically any movie or TV show or anime or anything manga?

37
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:38,565
Rym: That's really good.

38
00:02:39,047 --> 00:02:42,280
Rym: You should always do yourself a favor and read it or watch it twice.

39
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:52,500
Scott: Yeah, I mean if something it depends on how many stars is mean if it's like three or four stars good Then you don't really have to watch it again, but anything that's five stars good, you know.

40
00:02:52,922 --> 00:03:00,717
Scott: Especially if you haven't seen it in a while or read it in a while You should definitely go back because there are awesome bits you forgot that you will like to remember.

41
00:03:01,018 --> 00:03:05,119
Rym: in fact I think the most telling evidence of that was it was a while ago months ago.

42
00:03:05,581 --> 00:03:12,724
Rym: Emily was here visiting but she was up in the studio here working on an animation project and homework for school That she had to do.

43
00:03:13,105 --> 00:03:17,479
Rym: meanwhile Scott and I are downstairs and we decided to watch Star Wars Episode 4 again.

44
00:03:18,106 --> 00:03:19,140
Scott: That was a long time ago.

45
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,828
Rym: Yeah, it was but even to this day.

46
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:23,660
Rym: how many times have we each seen Star Wars Episode 4?

47
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,253
Scott: I could watch Star Wars Episode 4 or 5 or 6.

48
00:03:26,253 --> 00:03:29,440
Scott: It doesn't matter which one of those three I could watch each one a thousand time.

49
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,143
Scott: I could probably sit there for the rest of my life watching them in a loop and I would never Wouldn't get old.

50
00:03:34,323 --> 00:03:42,491
Rym: but even then no matter how many times I've seen those movies when we watch Episode 5 and he kills like the Second Admiral, it's still like.

51
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:48,559
Rym: I remembered that happened But I forgot how it happened and it was almost as amusing as the first time I saw it.

52
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:51,893
Scott: Yeah, it's like I totally didn't get that joke when I was a little kid.

53
00:03:51,954 --> 00:03:53,903
Scott: cuz I did it over my head when I was A little kid.

54
00:03:53,923 --> 00:03:55,151
Rym: I was just afraid of Darth Vader.

55
00:03:55,171 --> 00:03:58,591
Rym: I Wasn't afraid of Darth Vader like I was like woohoo.

56
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:00,480
Rym: I mean all I could think was on the screen.

57
00:04:00,681 --> 00:04:02,247
Scott: Oh, why isn't he on the screen more?

58
00:04:02,528 --> 00:04:05,280
Rym: Like I didn't think it was funny that he kept killing those admirals.

59
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,893
Rym: I thought it was just like Siri like dead serious and I was just like whoa.

60
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,319
Rym: He just killed that dude.

61
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,182
Rym: now I'm older.

62
00:04:11,202 --> 00:04:13,955
Rym: It's like yeah, good job Admiral so-and-so.

63
00:04:13,975 --> 00:04:19,339
Scott: Yeah Cuz he said cuz he kills a guy who's an act cuz you don't really pay attention.

64
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:27,668
Scott: Usually you're like when I was a kid of me to pay attention like which guy's the Admiral and when which guy's the Grand Moff And which guy's the talking was the Grand Moff?

65
00:04:27,688 --> 00:04:31,720
Rym: which guy's the commander which was a political appointment and not a military position.

66
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,383
Scott: That's correct.

67
00:04:33,045 --> 00:04:38,384
Scott: But now that I pay attention to that sort of thing, you know, I noticed that he kills Admiral what's-his-face.

68
00:04:38,525 --> 00:04:46,372
Scott: and then he goes to the guy who is the second in command and he says, you know Proceed as planned admiral something something.

69
00:04:46,432 --> 00:04:48,380
Scott: and I was like, oh he just promoted that guy.

70
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:55,115
Scott: I Didn't get that until I don't know high school days.

71
00:04:55,175 --> 00:04:55,880
Scott: I didn't get that joke.

72
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:58,774
Rym: Yeah, plus being older a lot of those things became quotes.

73
00:04:58,834 --> 00:05:06,399
Scott: I mean if this is a Get that joke into high school, but it wasn't funny until real recently.

74
00:05:07,082 --> 00:05:14,188
Rym: but mainly it seemed to become funny with the advent of the quotable memes and Exactly can't quote end Star Wars.

75
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:18,946
Scott: Yeah, I mean like in the early days of college No one was like where is the ambassador?

76
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,614
Scott: But nowadays where's the ambassador?

77
00:05:21,935 --> 00:05:23,660
Rym: I find your lack of faith disturbing.

78
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:24,985
Rym: Okay, right.

79
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,249
Rym: This isn't the Star Wars show.

80
00:05:26,269 --> 00:05:29,662
Rym: No, no, we've talked about Star Wars multiple times already Have we?

81
00:05:29,682 --> 00:05:31,028
Scott: I thought we only talked about it one time.

82
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,238
Rym: I'm pretty sure we've brought up Star Wars.

83
00:05:33,258 --> 00:05:42,640
Scott: Okay It's hard not to bring up Star Wars on fucking GeekNights not to mention on Science fiction day in addition to science day.

84
00:05:42,841 --> 00:05:46,340
Scott: I mean the only reason that we don't bring up Star Trek every two seconds because I don't like it.

85
00:05:46,761 --> 00:05:51,460
Rym: I however really like Star Trek and you can die in a fire captain doesn't like Firefly.

86
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:54,596
Scott: Yeah, I don't like that either or battle star Galactica.

87
00:05:54,676 --> 00:05:55,179
Scott: Not a fan.

88
00:05:56,382 --> 00:05:57,628
Rym: See the thing is I like the new best.

89
00:05:57,668 --> 00:05:58,191
Rym: I'm like.

90
00:05:58,231 --> 00:05:59,337
Scott: I'm not a nerd.

91
00:05:59,357 --> 00:06:00,963
Rym: No, no No, you'd only be.

92
00:06:01,063 --> 00:06:06,980
Rym: I'd only be a nerd if I like Star Wars or Star Trek or I don't know underwear perverts.

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,143
Scott: Well, maybe I am a nerd cuz I do like like really old shitty sci-fi like Lost in space.

94
00:06:14,163 --> 00:06:14,685
Rym: Wait a minute.

95
00:06:14,725 --> 00:06:15,227
Rym: Wait a minute.

96
00:06:15,588 --> 00:06:18,840
Rym: If you like all that, how come you don't like the original Battlestar Galactica?

97
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:20,825
Scott: I never really saw too much really.

98
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:25,100
Scott: Yeah, I saw like two episodes of whatever Battlestar Galactica is up your alley.

99
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:30,780
Rym: It is what only cheesy people blowing stuff up and flying around and stuff up is good.

100
00:06:30,881 --> 00:06:32,478
Rym: There's a lot of people blowing stuff up.

101
00:06:32,941 --> 00:06:36,674
Rym: You'd probably identify with the main character cuz he's pretty much just a woman iser.

102
00:06:36,694 --> 00:06:38,179
Scott: I'm not a woman iser.

103
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,419
Rym: Well, not there any fault of trying.

104
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:44,931
Scott: Not a woman eyes here in the classic sense.

105
00:06:45,092 --> 00:06:46,719
Scott: I'm a woman eyes or the humorous sense.

106
00:06:48,602 --> 00:06:51,531
Rym: Anyway We got some kind of big news today.

107
00:06:51,551 --> 00:06:52,980
Rym: I'll let Scott take it.

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,411
Rym: It was gonna be my news, but then I saw your news first.

109
00:06:55,813 --> 00:06:57,079
Rym: Well, alright, I'll do my news.

110
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,694
Rym: My news was gonna be the thing.

111
00:06:59,714 --> 00:07:00,680
Rym: that's gonna be Scott's news.

112
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:11,829
Rym: But then I realized again that there's this news that angered me Much more so than the other news and lightened me or made me happy To not go into all the details.

113
00:07:12,352 --> 00:07:14,040
Rym: a school and this isn't in the Bible belt.

114
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:19,037
Rym: This is pretty much right near us in the civilized part of downstate, New York.

115
00:07:19,137 --> 00:07:21,720
Rym: Actually, it's in New Jersey But yeah, ten miles west of Manhattan.

116
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:27,340
Rym: So up here You can't knock this off as being somewhere out in the middle of nowhere in a rural community or like Utah.

117
00:07:27,801 --> 00:07:37,348
Rym: Yeah teacher respected teacher teacher who probably has tenure at a fancy-pants school a good school a public school Supposedly also a good teacher.

118
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:53,651
Rym: Yeah loved by the students begins his studies by going on crazy Evangelical rants about how Adam and Eve lived with the dinosaurs and Noah's Ark was real and a Muslim girl in class is gonna go To hell and the Big Bang Theory and evolution are bullshit.

119
00:07:54,234 --> 00:07:55,580
Scott: now one kid?

120
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,109
Rym: No, not not even a science teacher.

121
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,980
Rym: This is like a AP government class or something.

122
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,937
Scott: Wow, so one kid in the class is awesome.

123
00:08:05,037 --> 00:08:07,024
Scott: He's a hero Definite hero.

124
00:08:07,104 --> 00:08:22,700
Rym: Yeah, this kid saw what was going on and rightfully so thought that this is wrong Possibly illegal or at least contrary to the ideals of the Constitution of the United States and the principles of the separation of church and state and Really made him uncomfortable.

125
00:08:23,242 --> 00:08:29,820
Rym: so he brought and he didn't see he would have just a normal kid would have just complained to his parents or complained to the School or written a letter or call a lawyer.

126
00:08:30,366 --> 00:08:32,243
Rym: This kid was smart The got.

127
00:08:32,283 --> 00:08:36,419
Rym: the teacher was so crazy and what he was saying that the kid didn't think that anyone would believe him.

128
00:08:36,961 --> 00:08:39,871
Rym: So we stuck a tape recorder into class and recorded this.

129
00:08:39,912 --> 00:08:42,280
Rym: teachers batshit rants about religion.

130
00:08:42,962 --> 00:08:51,200
Scott: Now some people accuse the kid because I mean the teacher obviously must have done it one or two times on his own In order to prompt the kid to bring in the tape recorder.

131
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:57,380
Scott: People accuse the kid of like baiting the teacher to make him talk about religion more like for the recorder.

132
00:08:58,002 --> 00:09:06,355
Scott: But if you actually listen to the recordings the kid never starts any of the conversations, although he does further their.

133
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:10,016
Scott: He extends them by furthering the line of questioning.

134
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,423
Scott: if you will See now.

135
00:09:11,463 --> 00:09:22,811
Rym: this is why the news and I bring it up as such a big deal because it's not just That this teacher was crazy and doing these crazy things because that alone Happens with a variety of subjects on a semi-regular basis.

136
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:24,195
Rym: There are crazy teachers out there.

137
00:09:24,636 --> 00:09:25,940
Rym: There are teachers who have bad days.

138
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,889
Rym: There are teachers who were just nutty but have tenure.

139
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:30,420
Rym: I had a teacher once who was so senile.

140
00:09:30,942 --> 00:09:32,991
Rym: I don't think he even knew where he was, but he had tenure.

141
00:09:33,011 --> 00:09:34,940
Scott: Yeah, I've had nutty teachers.

142
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:51,360
Scott: But you know, I realized looking back like a lot of things teachers said when I was a student I didn't realize that they were like avoiding talking about religion or anything, you know, yeah Now I realize oh those teachers said those things because of this and those teachers are hippies and those teachers aren't.

143
00:09:51,380 --> 00:10:01,602
Rym: well I had one teacher in middle in high school who was a 100% died in the wool red communist straight-up communist.

144
00:10:01,683 --> 00:10:02,325
Scott: I never had.

145
00:10:02,366 --> 00:10:05,338
Scott: all my teachers are pretty much capital, but he definitely.

146
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:14,120
Rym: he Presented the material, you know in social studies in an objective and non-biased manner and you wouldn't know he was a communist at all.

147
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,437
Rym: He just seemed like a really good teacher and he was really good.

148
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:34,811
Rym: But because then he'd take the kids he thought were smart to the side and like give him a copy of various Literature and talk to them about communism, but he was really cool, dude I had a lot of fun with him But despite the fact that he had very deeply held convictions about certain things He kept that out of the classroom and just taught the objective.

149
00:10:35,172 --> 00:10:39,651
Rym: at least as objective as history can be truth He taught what the curriculum told him to.

150
00:10:40,093 --> 00:10:42,182
Scott: now there's a problem with the curriculum So be it.

151
00:10:42,644 --> 00:10:43,667
Rym: but now what's?

152
00:10:43,928 --> 00:10:57,815
Rym: the issue here is not so much that this happened or that the kid was smart but that the majority of the students in the school and the administration and the community are backing the teacher and Ostracizing this kid for stepping forward.

153
00:10:58,499 --> 00:11:12,378
Scott: now I can understand that if someone goes against a well-liked teacher But when there's evidence right there and it's clearly illegal and the judge and everyone is like, yeah That's not cool and it's oh god

154
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:20,010
Rym: now I mean this kid's family even received at least one death threat from local People who are mad about the fact that they step forward.

155
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:21,896
Rym: the police are currently investigating that.

156
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:25,370
Rym: yeah now I'm sure that is not the majority.

157
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:32,857
Rym: I'm not going to cast any wide dispersions here But I'm betting it's a Christian person who thinks they're all good or at least someone who thinks they're Christian.

158
00:11:32,957 --> 00:11:37,292
Rym: Yeah But what's the line of thinking that goes from?

159
00:11:37,312 --> 00:11:41,816
Rym: yeah, I'm a Christian turn the other cheek, uh threaten a guy with death.

160
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:44,345
Scott: What's the line there?

161
00:11:44,486 --> 00:11:47,300
Scott: Yeah, isn't he going to hell supposedly on his own?

162
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,591
Scott: What do you need to help him along for shouldn't?

163
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,080
Scott: isn't God gonna smite him?

164
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,264
Scott: What do you know?

165
00:11:52,285 --> 00:11:53,793
Scott: you're gonna go to hell for killing someone.

166
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,140
Scott: thou shalt not kill what the fuck?

167
00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:03,540
Rym: Well, I remember even when I went to Catholic school when I was a young kid And you know, I wasn't a Catholic by any stretch, but I would pay it like we'd have to take religion class.

168
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,824
Rym: That was part of going to a Catholic school.

169
00:12:05,286 --> 00:12:09,660
Rym: My only other option was to go to Detroit Public Schools, which was not an option.

170
00:12:10,443 --> 00:12:11,446
Scott: It was an option.

171
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:13,092
Rym: No, it was not an option.

172
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:15,160
Rym: It wasn't even on the list of options.

173
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,140
Scott: It just wasn't good.

174
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:19,059
Rym: It was not an option.

175
00:12:20,022 --> 00:12:21,187
Rym: They would have killed me.

176
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,774
Rym: I would have died.

177
00:12:23,055 --> 00:12:23,999
Rym: There would have been no Rym.

178
00:12:25,023 --> 00:12:40,471
Rym: There might have still been a Rym Yeah But even then I remember that one of the points that the nuns always drilled into us aside from Don't write with your left hand and don't masturbate Was that you can't ever.

179
00:12:40,531 --> 00:12:46,200
Rym: you're not supposed to punish someone for sinning Because God will take care of that and you're just supposed to let people be and do your own thing.

180
00:12:47,681 --> 00:12:50,593
Scott: So wait, but then the nuns punished you for supposedly sinning, didn't they?

181
00:12:50,753 --> 00:12:52,400
Rym: The nuns punished me for a lot of things.

182
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,868
Scott: So what didn't you say to the nuns?

183
00:12:54,928 --> 00:12:56,293
Scott: I thought you're not supposed to punish.

184
00:12:56,313 --> 00:12:58,380
Rym: Don't get me started on Catholic school.

185
00:12:59,401 --> 00:13:02,058
Rym: Alright, the only nun that was nice was the one who gave me a gerbil.

186
00:13:03,721 --> 00:13:04,485
Scott: Wait a minute.

187
00:13:04,866 --> 00:13:05,128
Scott: What?

188
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:06,494
Scott: The nun gave you a gerbil.

189
00:13:06,514 --> 00:13:07,659
Scott: Where did she give you the gerbil?

190
00:13:08,701 --> 00:13:15,134
Rym: The school had with the one nun Had a whole bunch of gerbils in the classroom this giant like maze.

191
00:13:15,154 --> 00:13:16,740
Scott: and what were the gerbils for?

192
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:22,877
Rym: They were for looking at and playing with and one time one of them got stuck in a cardboard tube.

193
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:25,638
Rym: No in his cage.

194
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,040
Rym: I woke up one day ready to go to school.

195
00:13:29,222 --> 00:13:38,187
Rym: I was in third grade, you know The nun did with those gerbils after school and I heard a noise and I look and one of the gerbils is stuck in a Cardboard tube like his butts hanging out.

196
00:13:38,468 --> 00:13:40,838
Rym: and he's stuck and we're trying to get him out.

197
00:13:40,878 --> 00:13:41,400
Rym: He's freaking out.

198
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,411
Rym: We can't pull him out.

199
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:43,179
Rym: That's not gonna work.

200
00:13:43,603 --> 00:13:44,813
Rym: So my dad comes in.

201
00:13:44,853 --> 00:13:45,438
Rym: we're looking at it.

202
00:13:45,781 --> 00:13:51,460
Rym: My dad picks up the cardboard tube Puts his mouth up to the other end and just goes whoo and blows into it.

203
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,659
Rym: The gerbil just pops out the other side like a blowgun.

204
00:13:54,586 --> 00:13:55,279
Rym: Gerbil was fine.

205
00:13:56,442 --> 00:13:57,610
Scott: Her dad blows gerbils.

206
00:13:58,154 --> 00:13:59,000
Rym: Yeah, he does.

207
00:13:59,742 --> 00:14:04,560
Rym: the point is that this whole situation is just kind of crazy and I can't believe that.

208
00:14:05,921 --> 00:14:11,160
Rym: Not not that anyone would argue against the separation of church and state because there are people who do argue against it.

209
00:14:11,621 --> 00:14:19,109
Rym: The fact that so many people are on this teacher's side and not only don't want the teacher to be punished But commend him for doing the things he did.

210
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:21,780
Scott: there are people who want this kid to be expelled.

211
00:14:21,923 --> 00:14:22,658
Scott: It's like what the fuck?

212
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:29,348
Rym: I mean if these reports have been believed he told the class that a Muslim girl in the class is going to hell because she's Not Christian.

213
00:14:29,794 --> 00:14:32,969
Scott: Yeah That is not acceptable under any stretch.

214
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:39,500
Scott: I would send someone to like the local jail for a week for that kind of action.

215
00:14:40,162 --> 00:14:44,957
Scott: I would just fire the judge if I were firing the teacher is a given.

216
00:14:44,977 --> 00:14:47,287
Rym: Yeah That's all I do.

217
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:48,191
Rym: I wouldn't do anything else.

218
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:49,800
Rym: I wouldn't take any sort of punitive step.

219
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:54,760
Scott: I'm starting to think that there's a possible sentence that could be given out in this country.

220
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:57,577
Scott: Often that has never been given out as far as I know.

221
00:14:57,597 --> 00:15:00,328
Scott: ridicule No prison for a day.

222
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,419
Scott: send someone to the worst prison for a day.

223
00:15:04,141 --> 00:15:05,888
Scott: Most people will learn their fucking lesson.

224
00:15:05,908 --> 00:15:10,364
Rym: if you know what I would learn my lesson cuz I go I drive past a prison And I learned my lesson.

225
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:11,107
Scott: Yeah, I know.

226
00:15:11,187 --> 00:15:17,631
Rym: so when our one of our friends works in a prison and She has some fucking stories.

227
00:15:17,732 --> 00:15:22,680
Rym: Yeah talking to her for five minutes You would kill yourself before you go to a federal prison exactly.

228
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,182
Scott: So why?

229
00:15:23,202 --> 00:15:30,920
Scott: there are a lot of people that do things that aren't so bad and you know They're basically good people, but they screwed up and they need to be taught a lesson.

230
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,480
Scott: And since we can't you know beat them with a cane or anything like they do in some other countries.

231
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:37,531
Scott: Why not actually for a day?

232
00:15:37,732 --> 00:15:46,760
Rym: actually there's been an uptick in judges ordering people to non-conventional punishments really and most Recently a guy was caught.

233
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,056
Rym: He was parking in handicapped spots like a chronic guy.

234
00:15:50,076 --> 00:15:50,920
Rym: He did it more than well.

235
00:15:50,981 --> 00:15:53,200
Scott: He did it all the time so he could just park close.

236
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,137
Rym: Well, he did it enough to where the judge decided that a fine wouldn't be enough.

237
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:07,712
Rym: all right He had to stand at the store where he did it with a sign on saying that I am NOT handicapped yet I park in handicapped spaces for like a whole day at the handicapped space.

238
00:16:08,254 --> 00:16:12,109
Rym: so people who parked there legitimately could Have words with him.

239
00:16:12,129 --> 00:16:16,048
Rym: Uh-huh And they did a cop.

240
00:16:16,068 --> 00:16:17,496
Scott: stand there and make sure you didn't.

241
00:16:17,516 --> 00:16:18,019
Rym: yes, yes.

242
00:16:18,961 --> 00:16:27,128
Rym: and there was another one recently where a shop a chronic shoplifter was caught and had to stand in the store with a placard saying That I'm a shoplifter for like a week.

243
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:28,392
Scott: I'm liking this action.

244
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,940
Scott: Yeah, I mean still prison for a day.

245
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,482
Scott: That's a good one.

246
00:16:31,502 --> 00:16:31,924
Scott: Don't you think?

247
00:16:32,105 --> 00:16:34,194
Rym: well my philosophy on the we.

248
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:46,180
Rym: we should do a whole show on this Like we keep saying well, but very very briefly before we go on to the other news I am of the mind that there should be two forms Really three forms of punishment and they should be totally different for crimes.

249
00:16:46,762 --> 00:17:01,535
Rym: the first one and the one that should be used most often should be pure rehabilitation and if in the very least the redressing of Grievances as in if someone causes damage they have to repair the damage and if someone does something bad you try to make it so that they won't do anything bad again.

250
00:17:01,936 --> 00:17:09,760
Rym: because that you want people to be good people and But screwing people over for minor crimes is not going to help them be a good person If anything is going to make them a worse person.

251
00:17:09,961 --> 00:17:17,354
Scott: Most people are good people and there's a lot of people out there who might you know Repeatedly commit minor crimes like an awesome graffiti artist or something.

252
00:17:17,675 --> 00:17:20,400
Scott: Just make them clean it up But what the hell man?

253
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:29,537
Rym: Well, if I mean generally if anyone on nonviolent crime if you're caught once I think Rehabilitation is should always be the primary form of punishment.

254
00:17:29,618 --> 00:17:29,778
Rym: Yep.

255
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:31,699
Rym: Yep Not really don't even call the punishment.

256
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:31,981
Rym: Just.

257
00:17:32,402 --> 00:17:37,458
Rym: the first goal should always be to get someone back into society and undo whatever harm they did.

258
00:17:37,478 --> 00:17:37,899
Rym: Mm-hmm.

259
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:47,673
Rym: However, failing that like if our chronic offender like someone who keeps parking in handicapped spaces for years and years and years And he just pays the fines and keeps going about it.

260
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,926
Rym: or people who just keep doing thing Keep robbing people keep mugging people.

261
00:17:51,448 --> 00:17:55,682
Rym: then you go to phase two where you don't you're still trying to rehabilitate them But you punish them.

262
00:17:55,983 --> 00:18:03,219
Scott: punitive you've got because you if someone's recurring like that, you know that letting them out into the world They're only going to do it more.

263
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,595
Scott: So you have to keep them out of society to fix them as opposed to letting them be in.

264
00:18:07,656 --> 00:18:12,055
Rym: so it's phase one is Give them a way to write themselves and be a good person.

265
00:18:12,075 --> 00:18:13,100
Scott: This is gonna turn into the whole episode.

266
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:13,541
Scott: Let's hurry down.

267
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:13,762
Scott: All right.

268
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:15,366
Rym: phase one positive reinforcement.

269
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:17,632
Rym: phase two negative reinforcement.

270
00:18:17,893 --> 00:18:20,340
Rym: phase three scientific research or execution.

271
00:18:21,281 --> 00:18:23,880
Scott: Phase four if they're a nutcase put them in a nut house.

272
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:28,700
Scott: Well, yeah, but that's a lot of people who are nut cases and they need to be put in nut houses But you don't have anymore.

273
00:18:28,744 --> 00:18:34,937
Rym: Yeah The sad thing is that most of those people now are either homeless on the street and don't realize they can get help or they're in jail.

274
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:37,164
Scott: Yeah, all right.

275
00:18:37,565 --> 00:18:41,295
Rym: Anyway, the more important news today Oh more important.

276
00:18:41,315 --> 00:18:41,596
Scott: Yes.

277
00:18:41,977 --> 00:18:42,940
Scott: Well to us, okay.

278
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:50,280
Scott: So perhaps the most important website of the past year or so is dig.com.

279
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,098
Scott: Basically, we used to have sites like slash stop meme pool, etc, etc.

280
00:18:55,122 --> 00:18:55,623
Rym: They're gone.

281
00:18:55,683 --> 00:18:59,473
Scott: now dig I mean FARC is still around a bit.

282
00:18:59,634 --> 00:19:01,960
Rym: and what do you mean if a FARC is strong as ever?

283
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,453
Scott: Well, yeah slash dot you could say as strong as I know if I wanted to.

284
00:19:05,473 --> 00:19:08,243
Rym: slash shot is rapidly In trouble.

285
00:19:08,464 --> 00:19:18,995
Scott: drudge is still around, you know, this site still exists, but dig is swiftly and has been swiftly Conquering all of them like a mighty stomping Monty Python foot.

286
00:19:19,035 --> 00:19:20,300
Scott: Just squish squish squish.

287
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:26,470
Rym: Yeah dig is kind of like slowly becoming the convergence of all Popular internet culture.

288
00:19:26,491 --> 00:19:35,469
Scott: Yeah, and Whereas sites like slash went without feature updates or anything for years and years and years and years, you know Where they didn't even change it.

289
00:19:35,489 --> 00:19:45,450
Scott: to goddamn thing Dig seems to be upgrading with completely new versions that add vast new amazing features for the improvement of everything every few months.

290
00:19:46,499 --> 00:19:51,266
Scott: and today surprise surprise Dig calm I think it's 3.0.

291
00:19:51,266 --> 00:19:54,536
Rym: Yeah, I remember I was at work and I was.

292
00:19:54,897 --> 00:19:57,340
Rym: I had some free time So I went to dig and I dug some things.

293
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,700
Rym: I was looking for news to talk about today and then I went out and did something.

294
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:08,160
Rym: I came back to my desk and I just hit f5, you know Refresh dig before I go about my business and a black screen came up that said dig is currently upgrading.

295
00:20:08,655 --> 00:20:14,520
Scott: Yeah Usually they have like the dig the little guy with the shovel and he says we're under construction or something's going on.

296
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,040
Scott: We'll be back up soon and it's got a few links to stuff.

297
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,675
Scott: But this one was like upgrading bitches.

298
00:20:20,158 --> 00:20:26,820
Rym: Oh shit Yeah Now we're gonna talk about probably at least the most important to us aspect of the upgrade as the main bit.

299
00:20:27,322 --> 00:20:43,740
Rym: But suffice to say if you don't use dig at all, or you don't have an account on dig I highly recommend you get one because it's getting to the point where dig is actually a useful Usable wonderful site that will probably make your internetting experience a much better thing.

300
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:50,580
Scott: Yeah, I mean there's a lot of things to be said about dig that are negative but as I said dig keeps changing.

301
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,080
Scott: They're trying to make things better unlike other sites where people complain and the site would never change.

302
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,079
Scott: It would just keep adding news without changing the site itself.

303
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:10,040
Scott: Dig is always growing and growing better and growing more awesome all the time And it is basically the center of all that is importance on the Internet's as far as we are concerned.

304
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:22,613
Rym: Now the the thing that we really want to talk about we'll bring it up now Then we'll go in depth in the news segment is simply that they have added Podcasts to dig as an official legitimate fully supported thing.

305
00:21:22,653 --> 00:21:24,379
Rym: It's beta now, but it's there.

306
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:41,478
Rym: Yes they opened it up today and You had to like we everyone had to submit podcasts to it and there was some trouble because it looks like and we're not sure That they are manually verifying and placing every podcast Like they're verifying that they're legitimate.

307
00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:47,839
Scott: also I'm sure it takes quite a while for their software to you know, grab all the episodes in your feed, etc, etc, etc.

308
00:21:48,634 --> 00:21:51,108
Rym: Yeah Cuz there's also the way dig is doing.

309
00:21:51,148 --> 00:22:02,220
Rym: podcast is really different from the way anyone else is doing them Which I think is a wonderfully fantastic thing because I have beefs with things like podcast pickle or what's that?

310
00:22:03,061 --> 00:22:09,297
Scott: Podcast alley podcast alley or pop currents odeo What are some other ones?

311
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,186
Rym: Yahoo podcasts podcast like.

312
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,232
Rym: they all had serious issues.

313
00:22:14,453 --> 00:22:19,109
Rym: that then they really made him pretty much at least to me Unusable or not worth even going to.

314
00:22:19,189 --> 00:22:21,620
Rym: but dig seems to have it down already.

315
00:22:21,829 --> 00:22:25,008
Scott: Yep So dig has added a dig style podcast directory.

316
00:22:25,068 --> 00:22:31,694
Scott: now the most important feature of dig actually is that they've split off the video Section because what was happening?

317
00:22:31,714 --> 00:22:32,620
Scott: there are two things.

318
00:22:33,147 --> 00:22:43,471
Scott: first of all videos are getting a lot more digs than any other news stories or anything else and they were upsetting to dig out of the rhythm because it's hard to tell when to bring something to the front page.

319
00:22:43,913 --> 00:22:57,099
Scott: if a video is likely to get way more digs than A news story and they followed the same rule for getting to the front page Well, then these moderately popular videos are getting up there with the very popular blog entries and it doesn't really work out.

320
00:22:58,322 --> 00:23:01,780
Scott: So they put videos in their own section just like podcasts are in their own section.

321
00:23:02,443 --> 00:23:17,140
Scott: The other thing that dig has done is you know for a while Dig has had a feature where if you link to YouTube or wherever it would put a link so you could go directly to the You know video from and it would have a little preview of the video like one little picture.

322
00:23:17,582 --> 00:23:36,657
Scott: They still have that but now you can watch the video in Dig, you don't have to go to YouTube and then watch it Yes, so now You know You can just watch all the amazing videos of the day from dig with no need to go to YouTube or Google video or any Of those other places depending on if it's supported by dig.

323
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:56,080
Rym: now of course the the selfish part is to follow and We've said before that we don't ever want to promote ourselves like, you know Go to podcast alley and vote for us because those sites are kind of crap and it's really crap to Be a podcast and have to ask your listeners to go do something like that on a regular basis just to make you more popular.

324
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,708
Scott: Yeah to make us more popular.

325
00:23:57,809 --> 00:23:59,900
Scott: It should be us doing things not you.

326
00:24:00,261 --> 00:24:03,653
Scott: It's not your obligation to do things to make us more popular.

327
00:24:03,773 --> 00:24:05,780
Rym: Especially not a recurring thing.

328
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,419
Scott: Yeah, if you want to you know, go do things to promote us.

329
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:10,863
Scott: That's cool.

330
00:24:10,964 --> 00:24:13,835
Scott: But we're not going to you know, ask you to do it.

331
00:24:13,976 --> 00:24:20,820
Scott: It's yeah, it's up to you If you think we're good which you're gonna spread the word about us many views without us telling you.

332
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:28,979
Rym: I mean, we've had people email us asking if they would be allowed to distribute our flyers at conventions They go to that are too far away for us to attend.

333
00:24:29,321 --> 00:24:33,100
Rym: Yeah, and that they that I mean people they ask like would you mind if we did this?

334
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,880
Scott: We're always like no do whatever the hell you want.

335
00:24:36,305 --> 00:24:37,519
Scott: It's like if I read a book.

336
00:24:38,062 --> 00:24:38,885
Scott: I don't need the odd.

337
00:24:38,965 --> 00:24:45,070
Scott: if the author comes and tells me hey you like my book and I'm like well kinda he's like Go and tell people to buy my book.

338
00:24:45,392 --> 00:24:46,799
Scott: Well now I'm not gonna bitch.

339
00:24:47,702 --> 00:24:50,460
Scott: It's like if he would have just not said anything and I like the book.

340
00:24:50,661 --> 00:24:54,495
Scott: I would have naturally spread the word just the way you spread the word about anything you like.

341
00:24:54,736 --> 00:24:59,619
Rym: but more that's yeah Yeah, but more specifically the things like podcast alley where they make you keep going back.

342
00:25:00,161 --> 00:25:11,600
Scott: Yeah, it's like not only what an is it an ass for an author to come and tell me to go and promote his book For him, but now he's gonna tell me that I have to do something every single month to promote his book for him.

343
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:13,506
Scott: Well, fuck you two times bitch.

344
00:25:13,988 --> 00:25:17,320
Scott: That's why we don't ask you to go to podcast alley like other podcast.

345
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:21,313
Scott: If I am all our friend podcast, yeah every other podcast out there.

346
00:25:21,373 --> 00:25:23,400
Rym: Yeah, I don't think Dave and Joel do that.

347
00:25:23,621 --> 00:25:24,545
Scott: No, I don't think they care.

348
00:25:24,826 --> 00:25:25,288
Scott: Oh, I don't know.

349
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:26,051
Scott: We'll see.

350
00:25:26,232 --> 00:25:27,920
Rym: Well, they're 40 listeners might get mad.

351
00:25:29,043 --> 00:25:30,695
Rym: I can't make fun of another podcast really.

352
00:25:30,735 --> 00:25:32,763
Scott: Yeah, they deserve 40,000 listeners.

353
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:39,280
Rym: Yeah can say well considering that both us and anime world order blatantly steal their brand of humor whenever possible.

354
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:42,210
Scott: Yeah, but I don't know whatever.

355
00:25:42,551 --> 00:25:42,752
Rym: I mean.

356
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:45,160
Rym: it's hard to not make jokes about space dollars.

357
00:25:46,301 --> 00:25:57,223
Rym: Anyway, anyway, the point is that if you we're going to ask this now mostly because dig is doing it Right, and you only have to do it once and if you don't use dig yet You should be using dig.

358
00:25:57,244 --> 00:25:59,774
Rym: So one if you don't have an account on dig.

359
00:25:59,814 --> 00:26:01,040
Rym: I highly recommend you check it out.

360
00:26:01,462 --> 00:26:02,025
Scott: Yeah, this is.

361
00:26:02,086 --> 00:26:04,400
Scott: this is not like dig telling us to promote dig.

362
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:07,580
Scott: I don't think dig even really needs promotion because it's so huge now.

363
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:16,472
Scott: But if you're an internet person or a geek, you should probably have a dig account and you should probably be using dig Day at least daily at least once a day.

364
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:17,720
Scott: You should be going there and checking stuff.

365
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:28,420
Rym: I mean if you want to know everything that's going on in the internet really quick and you don't want to deal with bark Just go to dig once a day and you'll be pretty much as on top of things as we are.

366
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,208
Scott: Yeah, uber geeks like me and Rym.

367
00:26:30,228 --> 00:26:37,820
Rym: We know everything that was important on the internet Because we read a lot of websites and spend a lot of time reading those websites.

368
00:26:37,989 --> 00:26:45,643
Scott: Yeah and dig is pretty much the easy way to skim off the top unlike us where we go all the way down and we check Out everything.

369
00:26:46,186 --> 00:26:49,180
Scott: if you just want to know we can't give everything to you in this podcast.

370
00:26:49,321 --> 00:26:51,370
Scott: You can only give you two news and two things of the day.

371
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:51,792
Scott: That's it.

372
00:26:52,294 --> 00:26:53,038
Rym: There's a lot of 10 news.

373
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:53,801
Rym: There's

374
00:26:53,821 --> 00:27:02,052
Scott: a lot more than two news and two things of the day out there and you're missing them if you're not going to certain Websites, but if you go to dig you're not gonna miss much

375
00:27:02,414 --> 00:27:06,348
Rym: now - and once again We'll never ask anyone to do this again and want to.

376
00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:09,681
Rym: and also remember that we're only asking this if you actually agree with It.

377
00:27:09,721 --> 00:27:18,612
Rym: if you like us you like GeekNights and you happen to have a dig account I would recommend I would suggest that you dig GeekNights.

378
00:27:18,672 --> 00:27:23,021
Rym: We're in there in addition to all of our feeds and I Have.

379
00:27:23,362 --> 00:27:24,546
Rym: being high up on.

380
00:27:24,566 --> 00:27:28,700
Rym: dig would make us and any other good podcast very popular.

381
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:34,779
Rym: In fact, the fact that a lot of our friend podcasters have not yet submitted themselves to dig is kind of amazing to me.

382
00:27:35,382 --> 00:27:41,011
Scott: No, I guess they're just not as geek because I thought like I'm not on top of this stuff cuz I was like Oh, alright this dig thing.

383
00:27:41,031 --> 00:27:42,079
Rym: We're on there and I dug us.

384
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:52,460
Rym: I was like, alright now I'm gonna dig all my favorite podcasts and super pods on there and 12 is Dean Emperor's got a bajillion day because it's a freaking awesome podcast and escape pods on there.

385
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,708

386
00:27:54,728 --> 00:27:55,491

Scott: I got a look.

00:28:01,698 --> 00:28:02,642
Rym: Hold on No, what?

395
00:28:02,683 --> 00:28:06,420
Rym: last time when I first searched we were the only anime podcast there for a while.

396
00:28:06,781 --> 00:28:08,367
Rym: Well, and then now there's two.

397
00:28:08,608 --> 00:28:11,519
Rym: well, there's one other anime podcast because there are three and two of them are us.

00:28:12,142 --> 00:28:13,065
Scott: Let's see anime.

399
00:28:13,105 --> 00:28:15,253
Scott: I just searched for anime on dig podcast.

400
00:28:15,313 --> 00:28:16,497
Scott: GeekNights with Roman Scott.

401
00:28:16,818 --> 00:28:18,944

Scott: all dig.

404
00:28:20,809 --> 00:28:21,431
Scott: r5 central.

405
00:28:21,972 --> 00:28:23,596
Scott: That's that guy who does it with the weird voice.

406
00:28:23,616 --> 00:28:28,611
Scott: Oh It's Mike Dent and a cyber assistant AI.

407
00:28:28,631 --> 00:28:30,900
Rym: wow, we're just promoting people left and right today.

408
00:28:31,021 --> 00:28:33,220
Scott: Yeah, they always play that promo on anime world order.

409
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:41,452
Scott: I've listened to the show once and I think it's a show that like that we fit in with and Like that we would be friendly with these guys.

410
00:28:41,572 --> 00:28:43,542
Scott: if it's more than one guy or just one I don't know.

411
00:28:44,345 --> 00:28:46,573
Scott: but listening to the show is really kind of weird.

412
00:28:46,774 --> 00:28:47,075
Scott: Whatever.

413
00:28:47,115 --> 00:28:48,480
Scott: This is an r5 central review.

414
00:28:48,721 --> 00:28:49,263
Rym: Yeah, I know.

415
00:28:49,323 --> 00:28:53,379
Rym: Well, I'll say that I know a lot of podcasters and I'm friends with him, but I don't listen to their shows.

416
00:28:53,682 --> 00:28:54,978
Rym: I'll be perfectly honest.

417
00:28:55,302 --> 00:29:02,159
Scott: Well, I mean seriously I'd like to be friends with hundreds of podcasters because podcasters tend to be awesome people but I can't listen to 100 shows.

418
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,684
Scott: You can't listen 100 shows.

419
00:29:03,724 --> 00:29:06,513
Scott: So yeah, it you're always gonna feel bad.

420
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:08,700
Scott: So you're best off just you know, accepting the truth.

421
00:29:09,222 --> 00:29:14,244
Rym: So once ever only if you were on dig dig GeekNights.

422
00:29:14,404 --> 00:29:15,768
Rym: and it'll make us more popular.

423
00:29:16,149 --> 00:29:19,478
Rym: and the more popular we get the more quickly we'll get swag out to you.

424
00:29:19,498 --> 00:29:22,899
Rym: and The more quickly we get swag out to you the more quickly you can wear it.

425
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:39,115
Rym: Things of the day Oh hot damn We're gonna be real quick about the things of the day because I just noticed by looking at the time that we actually went way Long on the first half of the show tonight.

426
00:29:39,357 --> 00:29:39,680
Scott: Ah shit.

427
00:29:40,181 --> 00:29:44,776
Rym: So, uh, I got a video about an awesome parrot and I recommend that you watch it.

428
00:29:45,298 --> 00:29:45,840
Scott: That was quick.

429
00:29:46,181 --> 00:29:47,044
Rym: Hey, what else can I say?

430
00:29:47,064 --> 00:29:47,646
Rym: It's a cool parrot.

431
00:29:48,007 --> 00:29:49,332
Scott: Okay, I got a video.

432
00:29:49,352 --> 00:29:53,667
Scott: some guys use jet engines to make their bicycles Go and what's way cool about it.

433
00:29:53,747 --> 00:29:57,240
Scott: Is there not evil kenevils trying to go really fast and hurt themselves?

434
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,051
Scott: They just go at normal speed which is wicked.

435
00:29:59,151 --> 00:29:59,433
Scott: Awesome.

436
00:29:59,855 --> 00:30:00,419
Rym: We should do that.

437
00:30:00,941 --> 00:30:04,354
Scott: Yeah, go like 45 60 miles an hour down the road on bicycles.

438
00:30:04,434 --> 00:30:06,923
Scott: perfectly safe cool stuff I did.

439
00:30:07,123 --> 00:30:12,100
Rym: I got up to like 42 miles an hour going on a downhill on my bike once.

440
00:30:12,361 --> 00:30:18,579
Rym: Imagine going 60 without having a pedal kind of like riding the cheapest motorbike in the world.

441
00:30:20,161 --> 00:30:28,683
Scott: Actually, it's kind of better because you just have this heat exhaust going up behind you instead of like this thunder in your pants I imagine.

442
00:30:28,703 --> 00:30:32,134
Scott: I think part of the experience of riding a motorcycle though is the Thunder in the pants.

443
00:30:32,917 --> 00:30:37,878
Rym: I have a Sneaking suspicion that the range of the rocket-powered bike was not so far.

444
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,900
Scott: Yeah, probably went through that kerosene pretty quickly All right.

445
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:53,680
Rym: Anyway, we said before that we would talk about podcast directories and mostly we want to talk about how dig is handling the whole Podcasting thing because they're really doing it better than anyone else has so far.

446
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:57,254
Scott: Let's talk about how people did it in the past so that we have something to compare to all right.

447
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,238
Rym: first there was iTunes.

448
00:30:59,242 --> 00:31:02,153
Scott: Well, no first iTunes didn't come until actually later.

449
00:31:02,595 --> 00:31:04,281
Scott: all those other sites came before I.

450
00:31:04,401 --> 00:31:09,600
Rym: before then is like the prehistory when there were like eight podcasters and nine podcast listeners.

451
00:31:10,082 --> 00:31:12,470
Scott: Yeah, I know but no there was podcast alley.

452
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:25,740
Scott: now podcast alley was just a site that lists Podcasts and what you do is if you go there every month you can vote for a podcast and to vote for a podcast You have to like type in your email address.

453
00:31:26,443 --> 00:31:29,756
Scott: Then it sends you an email and everything and it's kind of annoying.

454
00:31:29,776 --> 00:31:30,600
Rym: now think about that.

455
00:31:30,981 --> 00:31:34,439
Rym: You've got to go there every month and keep voting for something you like.

456
00:31:35,141 --> 00:31:40,640
Scott: Yeah, and if you vote for it enough, it'll show up in like the top 10 for a category.

457
00:31:40,781 --> 00:31:42,780
Scott: So let's say you're in the gaming category.

458
00:31:43,281 --> 00:31:49,820
Scott: Then people who go and look at the gaming podcast might see that podcast in the top 10 if it got enough votes.

459
00:31:50,362 --> 00:31:53,352
Rym: Now we don't need to tell you why this business model is stupid.

460
00:31:53,452 --> 00:32:02,340
Rym: most of the it's simply that this was done I don't know 10 years ago in the where's scene and it was just a corrupt thing then and it's just a stupid thing now.

461
00:32:02,765 --> 00:32:03,740
Scott: Yeah, it's real stupid.

462
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:09,400
Scott: I mean if you get enough votes you can get on the front page of podcast alley, but who goes to podcast alley?

463
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,831
Scott: It's like this site that people go to in order to vote for a podcast.

464
00:32:13,112 --> 00:32:15,640
Scott: No one goes there to actually find new podcasts.

465
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:26,212
Scott: It's just a site that podcasters go to to vote for themselves and see how many votes they got and a site where podcast Listeners go to vote for the podcast that they already listen to.

466
00:32:26,572 --> 00:32:29,279
Scott: it's really just this stupid kind of circular.

467
00:32:29,984 --> 00:32:31,720
Scott: See now this was like a circle jerk, really.

468
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:34,593
Rym: But this was tried before in the some of the early days of the internet.

469
00:32:34,633 --> 00:32:36,240
Rym: before search engines worked really well.

470
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,715
Rym: There were a lot of alternative means to search engines.

471
00:32:38,735 --> 00:32:46,606
Rym: there were directories there were web rings and there were a lot of top 100 sites and basically, you'd have the same thing.

472
00:32:46,626 --> 00:32:51,209
Rym: you'd have to go to the site every month and vote for your favorite sites and then they would go near the top.

473
00:32:51,796 --> 00:32:54,404
Rym: and It's like it's just.

474
00:32:54,444 --> 00:33:04,639
Rym: they're trying to get themselves free advertising in order to be popular on this site You have to force your listeners to go there Even though they probably don't want to actually go there and click on something for you.

475
00:33:05,462 --> 00:33:21,560
Scott: yeah, I think the big mistake that all these voting sites make that dig doesn't make and I guess delicious doesn't make it either is That it's a site where the only functionality is the only real functionality I mean, there's other stuff you can do here, but it's not useful is voting.

476
00:33:22,162 --> 00:33:31,660
Scott: It's like you have to provide a useful functionality that is improved by voting Like I dig sites to remember them and that happens to be a vote.

477
00:33:32,022 --> 00:33:34,500
Scott: Yeah, I guess the alley you vote for the sake of voting.

478
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,085
Scott: It's kind of what the hell.

479
00:33:36,225 --> 00:33:46,200
Rym: a site like this can only be actually truly useful and have any sort of longevity If people would go there Independent of just voting if they would go there on their own anyway.

480
00:33:46,461 --> 00:33:52,134
Scott: Yeah, and I'm sure there are people who go to podcast alley to find new podcasts But they are not large in number.

481
00:33:52,194 --> 00:33:58,260
Rym: by anything plus I mean It doesn't really select for the best podcast or the most popular podcast or the most relevant podcast.

482
00:33:58,621 --> 00:34:04,060
Rym: It selects for the podcast that does the best job of tricking its listeners into going there every month and clicking on something.

483
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:10,420
Scott: Yeah, number one is muggle cast, which I sell which I assume is some Harry Potter podcast.

484
00:34:11,221 --> 00:34:14,252
Scott: Number five is Snape cast and number three is Potter cast.

485
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:16,239
Scott: Well, they're number one is muggle cast.

486
00:34:16,661 --> 00:34:22,054
Scott: So obviously the Harry Potter fans are very rabid and they like to vote for their pie.

487
00:34:22,074 --> 00:34:23,318
Rym: Well, no, it's probably all.

488
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:32,123
Rym: generally Clusters of podcasts will get on the top of that site all the time as they all concertedly try to get all their listeners to collectively Vote for.

489
00:34:32,244 --> 00:34:35,514
Scott: I see so that all the Harry Potter fans listen to all the Harry Potter.

490
00:34:35,534 --> 00:34:42,100
Rym: give it a couple months and they all vote Collectively, yeah, so give it a couple months and they'll all fall off the ranking and some other cluster will move up to the top.

491
00:34:42,321 --> 00:34:48,380
Scott: Yeah, it's not really the most useful thing in the world, especially when you consider what really is the number one podcast.

492
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:50,830
Scott: Podcast alley doesn't match that so well.

493
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:57,000
Rym: Yeah, then there's iTunes which Doesn't really let you have much real input.

494
00:34:57,271 --> 00:35:00,468
Scott: well the iPod the iTunes directory is funny because it's.

495
00:35:00,689 --> 00:35:08,660
Scott: it's actually useful directory for finding new podcasts and Listening to them and downloading them if you are an iTunes iPod user.

496
00:35:09,384 --> 00:35:16,200
Scott: But in terms of it listing the best Podcasts, you know, it's not it doesn't have the best.

497
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:25,580
Rym: It basically ends up listing one the curt the most popular Podcast which rarely changes because they're kind of entrenched and they're always huge compared to everything else.

498
00:35:26,283 --> 00:35:35,636
Rym: And two it'll pick based on various secret algorithms Upcoming new podcasts that might not be popular that it wants to promote for whatever reason.

499
00:35:36,118 --> 00:35:36,840
Rym: and I hate to say it.

500
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:44,060
Rym: But I found that in many cases I mean the ones that are on top are usually well worth listening to and they usually deserve their spot.

501
00:35:44,662 --> 00:35:50,400
Rym: But a lot of times a podcast will be featured in a category on iTunes, but it'll totally suck balls.

502
00:35:51,424 --> 00:36:00,785
Rym: Yeah, I'm not gonna name names but I tried three different podcasts that purport to teach you French or Japanese or a language or something and They were featured meaning.

503
00:36:00,885 --> 00:36:06,906
Rym: Oh, they must be good or there must be something to them and they were crap like Absolute crap.

504
00:36:07,307 --> 00:36:17,120
Scott: Yeah, the podcast there that show up and like the top podcast Those are the ones that have a lot of people subscribing to them recently the ones that show up as featured.

505
00:36:17,581 --> 00:36:27,840
Scott: I think they're I'm pretty sure they're actually editors of the iTunes podcast directory who pick those Manually, I have words for some of the people who have picked some of those podcasts.

506
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,108
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what method they use to pick them.

507
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:31,894
Scott: I'm sure there's money involved.

508
00:36:31,974 --> 00:36:33,038
Scott: It's for some of them.

509
00:36:33,138 --> 00:36:47,360
Scott: I'm sure associations with existing Organizations matters a lot because you notice like ESPN is placed very highly Often and not that I listen to one ESPN podcast is really good But it's really just a recording of a really good TV show.

510
00:36:48,641 --> 00:36:51,595
Scott: But ESPN to Disney to Steve Jobs to Apple.

511
00:36:51,615 --> 00:36:51,937
Scott: Hello.

512
00:36:52,278 --> 00:36:53,924
Scott: Come on It's obvious.

513
00:36:53,984 --> 00:36:59,120
Rym: plus again iTunes is totally useless to everyone who doesn't use an iPod iTunes combo.

514
00:36:59,742 --> 00:37:00,203
Scott: Yep, it's.

515
00:37:00,444 --> 00:37:08,148
Scott: it's basically the I. the iTunes podcast directory is a tool for iPod iTunes users to subscribe to podcasts.

516
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:19,460
Scott: not really useful for figuring out which podcasts are the best Yeah, or discovering new things not the greatest but it's still compared to a lot of other things that are out there good enough.

517
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:25,880
Rym: It's okay, then like Libsyn has its directory and feedburner has its stuff, but those aren't really useful at all.

518
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,048
Scott: No, I don't even know why they even bothered.

519
00:37:28,309 --> 00:37:29,153
Scott: It's like Libsyn.

520
00:37:29,293 --> 00:37:30,117
Scott: The thing that you do.

521
00:37:30,177 --> 00:37:31,000
Scott: Well is hosting.

522
00:37:31,081 --> 00:37:32,712
Scott: Why are you trying to make a directory?

523
00:37:32,753 --> 00:37:33,800
Scott: That's just sort of attacked.

524
00:37:34,181 --> 00:37:35,967
Rym: Most people use Libsyn.

525
00:37:36,228 --> 00:37:42,702
Rym: use the full Libsyn gambit with all the stuff they offer Which is great if you don't know anything about the internet Mm-hmm.

526
00:37:42,983 --> 00:37:47,716
Rym: I mean, it's a really easy service for anyone to use but their their their community is really like.

527
00:37:47,756 --> 00:37:54,960
Rym: the people in their forums Are some of the scariest dumbest people not the moderators, but doesn't matter because people are gonna podfade.

528
00:37:55,583 --> 00:37:56,649
Rym: Yeah, a lot of them do.

529
00:37:56,669 --> 00:37:58,520
Rym: I think that's part of Libsyn's business model.

530
00:37:58,701 --> 00:38:00,028
Scott: I think that is the Libsyn's business model.

531
00:38:00,048 --> 00:38:02,138
Scott: is the same business model that like.

532
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:11,714
Rym: Well, you know If a podcast is kind of lame and has like 10 listeners even if they go forever That bandwidth is not costing Libsyn anything.

533
00:38:11,935 --> 00:38:14,847
Scott: No, it's the same Business model as gyms.

534
00:38:14,908 --> 00:38:18,000
Scott: you go to a gym and they sell you a membership for a year.

535
00:38:18,501 --> 00:38:25,360
Scott: If you if everyone who bought a gym membership actually showed up every day to work out the gym would go out of business.

536
00:38:25,782 --> 00:38:35,140
Scott: They make their money on people who buy gym memberships and maybe they'll go a few times But they don't show up for the whole year that they paid for and that's how the gym rakes in the dough.

537
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:41,440
Rym: Now then there's like podcast pickle which has a lot of the same problems as podcast alley just in a different angle.

538
00:38:41,792 --> 00:38:52,180
Scott: Yeah Podcast pickle actually tries to be a site that you can find new podcasts at and you can like mark podcasts as your favorite and whatever.

539
00:38:53,101 --> 00:38:55,855
Scott: But you know, it's really what.

540
00:38:55,915 --> 00:38:56,760
Scott: why would you go there?

541
00:38:57,922 --> 00:38:59,551
Scott: You can find podcasts elsewhere.

542
00:38:59,632 --> 00:39:01,318
Scott: You don't need to go to podcast pickle Yeah.

543
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:08,859
Rym: and then there's all the promo sites where podcasts will trade promos and you can go there and listen to promos and all that sort of thing.

544
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:16,720
Rym: and I'll say pretty openly that the vast majority of promos every podcast including us has ever done is terrible and lame.

545
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:22,300
Scott: Someone really has to figure out a formula for good podcast promos because I mean while I hate them.

546
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:33,293
Rym: Well, I think the problem is when I used to listen to the radio there was never ever in the history of my listening to the radio ever an Advertisement on the radio that didn't sound lame.

547
00:39:33,313 --> 00:39:34,520
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

548
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:38,139
Scott: There has to be a way to make a radio.

549
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:41,740
Rym: There is you know you do you do what we do and we don't play promos anymore.

550
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:47,557
Rym: We just say hey, I listen to anime world order the podcast about anime and worlds.

551
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:49,639
Rym: Oh Put it in order.

552
00:39:51,241 --> 00:39:52,023
Rym: Well, this is Monday.

553
00:39:52,043 --> 00:39:53,026
Rym: I'll suit a pod.

554
00:39:53,106 --> 00:39:56,936
Rym: is a good horror fantasy mostly horror fiction.

555
00:39:57,337 --> 00:39:57,537
Scott: Yep.

556
00:39:57,898 --> 00:39:58,299
Rym: Check it out.

557
00:39:58,882 --> 00:40:01,180
Rym: See so much easier than a stupid promo.

558
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:12,100
Rym: Yeah they could have had this like a guy pretending to be HP Lovecraft telling a story about Cthulhu and then oh It's about a podcast but that would have been totally lame and it's only at a place in our podcast.

559
00:40:12,281 --> 00:40:15,291
Scott: It's like ruin some of your podcast to help ours out.

560
00:40:15,652 --> 00:40:18,140
Scott: Yeah, you ever discovered a podcast via a promo?

561
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:22,160
Rym: I have never listened to a promo and thought hey, I should listen to a show.

562
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:26,053
Rym: In fact, I did it once and then I you were sorely disappointed.

563
00:40:26,133 --> 00:40:28,160
Scott: Well, I wasn't but it didn't last very long.

564
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:36,789
Rym: Every podcast I've been referred to it's because someone a podcast I trust said like hey I listen to blah not because they played the promo.

565
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:40,141
Rym: Yeah, and in fact there have been numerous promos I've heard.

566
00:40:40,222 --> 00:40:44,674
Rym: that just steal my conviction to not listen to those podcasts.

567
00:40:44,915 --> 00:40:46,560
Rym: They might be good in plenty of those.

568
00:40:47,143 --> 00:40:50,160
Rym: Yeah, so what is dig doing right here with their podcast?

569
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:55,440
Rym: Number one dig has a massive community already built around it.

570
00:40:55,761 --> 00:40:59,820
Rym: There are a lot of people who go to dig on a like hourly basis.

571
00:41:00,642 --> 00:41:06,080
Scott: Yep, number two digs podcast directory is primarily about usefulness.

572
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,660
Scott: It's hey Are there any you know?

573
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:13,780
Scott: Cuz you go to dig you don't go to dig to vote on things or to make things more popular.

574
00:41:13,901 --> 00:41:14,524
Scott: Some people do.

575
00:41:14,825 --> 00:41:17,960
Rym: we forgot to talk about Yahoo podcasts, but they're not that useful.

576
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:21,392
Scott: Well, Yahoo podcast is really the same as pretty much.

577
00:41:21,713 --> 00:41:23,820
Scott: Let's forget Yahoo podcast all the rest.

578
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,530
Scott: There are lots of podcast directories out there lots of them.

579
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:30,940
Scott: There's pod Nova Odeo Yahoo podcast, etc.

580
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:31,559
Scott: Etc, etc.

581
00:41:32,363 --> 00:41:40,331
Scott: And all of them are basically the same goddamn thing with slight variations in interface Like a little bit of tagging or a little bit of this.

582
00:41:40,411 --> 00:41:43,443
Rym: or they took away that you can listen to the shows live Whatever.

583
00:41:43,463 --> 00:41:47,560
Scott: pretty much what most of them have in common is you can listen to the shows on those pages.

584
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:54,844
Scott: So it's for inept people who don't have mp3 players and don't know how to use or for people who are looking For a new podcast.

585
00:41:54,905 --> 00:41:58,400
Rym: instead of subscribing going through all that you just listen to a snippet and if you like it you subscribe.

586
00:41:58,801 --> 00:42:06,424
Scott: Yeah, that that is a good use of those sites, but there's so many of those sites and all of them have Just there's.

587
00:42:06,444 --> 00:42:07,768
Scott: so I don't know.

588
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:09,072
Scott: They don't do any.

589
00:42:09,112 --> 00:42:10,196
Scott: there's no reason to go to them.

590
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:10,717
Scott: Basically.

591
00:42:10,838 --> 00:42:17,540
Rym: Yeah now dig Meanwhile has integrated all the useful functionality of pretty much every one of these sites and more.

592
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:25,295
Scott: Yeah, you go to like I was saying you go to dig not to vote for things But you go to dig to find new information and entertainment.

593
00:42:25,395 --> 00:42:26,500
Scott: That is the purpose of dig.

594
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:32,480
Scott: It filters the information and entertainment provided by the world wide web into one site.

595
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,990
Scott: So you can find links to it all and dig.

596
00:42:35,191 --> 00:42:37,440
Rym: does it with podcast fully integrated?

597
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:38,684
Rym: So there's a dig.

598
00:42:38,785 --> 00:42:40,031
Rym: you can dig a podcast.

599
00:42:40,312 --> 00:42:43,767
Rym: you can also within that podcast Dig individual episodes.

600
00:42:44,089 --> 00:42:46,840
Rym: if you go to a podcast it lists all the episodes they've got out.

601
00:42:47,261 --> 00:42:53,282
Rym: It also lists on the right sidebar the top 10 most dug episodes of that podcast Mm-hmm.

602
00:42:53,704 --> 00:43:04,576
Scott: Now if you go to the front page of dig podcast, so what you're going to see is Basically the most popular podcasts in all categories which are pretty much all the dig podcasts.

603
00:43:04,676 --> 00:43:06,040
Scott: dig nation is number two.

604
00:43:06,441 --> 00:43:08,369
Scott: Wait, dig nation is number one.

605
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:09,775
Scott: Twit is number two DL.

606
00:43:09,815 --> 00:43:12,903
Scott: that TV is number three Etc etc.

607
00:43:13,224 --> 00:43:17,900
Scott: It's it's obviously hey, those are the podcast that would be popular in the dig community.

608
00:43:18,343 --> 00:43:25,216
Scott: Duh, hey, but when you go to the subcategories Right now you start to see some action going on.

609
00:43:25,698 --> 00:43:31,520
Scott: Oh, wow You know if you go to the gaming and hobby subcategory right now, not only is GeekNights there.

610
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,693
Scott: But so is GeekNights Tuesdays on the front page.

611
00:43:34,894 --> 00:43:36,260
Rym: No, I gotta hand it to our listeners.

612
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:37,181
Rym: I've.

613
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:41,820
Rym: we found out about this dig podcast right away and Scott and I both went immediately on our own.

614
00:43:42,301 --> 00:43:48,920
Rym: Well, I'd better submit GeekNights and we both were cock-blocked by the fact that our listeners had all already done it.

615
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,173
Scott: I know who it was because they fessed up in the forum.

616
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:53,223
Rym: Yeah, but other listeners What'd you do?

617
00:43:53,605 --> 00:43:54,408
Rym: other listeners were like.

618
00:43:54,468 --> 00:43:57,159
Rym: I tried to submit you but I guess you already were on top of that.

619
00:43:57,581 --> 00:43:57,942
Scott: That's cuz.

620
00:43:57,962 --> 00:44:01,856
Scott: our listeners are all hip internet people who are on top of that dig every minute.

621
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:08,155
Scott: Yeah kudos to you guys Losers who you know where we say some old news from last week and they go why?

622
00:44:08,597 --> 00:44:09,720
Scott: what did that happen?

623
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,280
Scott: No, our people are on top of shit.

624
00:44:11,361 --> 00:44:12,319
Scott: They know what's going on.

625
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:20,637
Scott: But now the other thing that makes it really useful Because I mean knowing what the most popular podcasts are in all categories is not so useful.

626
00:44:20,717 --> 00:44:26,880
Scott: I mean, come on I don't need to see dig nation twit and DL TV, you know, I already know about those.

627
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:28,353
Scott: You're either listening or you're not.

628
00:44:28,394 --> 00:44:32,210
Scott: at this point What you need to know are on the right side.

629
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:33,575
Scott: is that all the useful stuff.

630
00:44:33,896 --> 00:44:38,520
Scott: the first thing it shows you Are the episodes recently dug by your friends?

631
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:46,520
Scott: So if one of your friends found a really awesome episode of some podcast like holy shit some podcast random podcast had an amazing episode.

632
00:44:47,181 --> 00:44:51,760
Scott: You'll see that over there that your friend dug it and you should make friends with all the people that you know.

633
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:56,880
Scott: Use dig that you know because then you know if they like the same stuff as you and they dig something you'll find out about.

634
00:44:57,221 --> 00:44:59,147
Rym: They're also really trying to foster this whole.

635
00:44:59,549 --> 00:45:02,278
Rym: they want a community around podcast within dig.

636
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:02,759
Rym: Mm-hmm.

637
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,703
Rym: So they're setting up I mean they set ups.

638
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:12,170
Rym: you can comment just like a dig article on every single individual episode of a podcast and on the podcast Itself, you know, I don't think you can comment.

639
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:13,840
Scott: you can comment on the podcast itself.

640
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,420
Rym: I'm pretty sure I wasn't able to when I wanted to earlier when I was fiddling with it.

641
00:45:17,541 --> 00:45:18,389
Scott: Let me check it right now.

642
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:19,480
Scott: You talk about something.

643
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,764
Rym: well well Scott checks it out.

644
00:45:20,804 --> 00:45:31,583
Rym: the one thing that I really want to bring up because I think this is probably the thing the one Factor aside from the fact that dig is already popular like beyond that that's going to make this dig podcast thing So amazing.

645
00:45:32,205 --> 00:45:35,420
Rym: every podcast directory has the problem of how do you pick?

646
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:40,778
Rym: what podcasts are good and which ones aren't which ones are popular and which ones aren't and which one should be listened to.

647
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:44,393
Rym: and Some people try to do it manually by having people like editors pick them.

648
00:45:44,714 --> 00:45:46,020
Rym: some people let you just vote raw.

649
00:45:46,361 --> 00:45:50,152
Rym: Some people make you go through hoops to vote to try to prevent vote spam dig.

650
00:45:50,172 --> 00:45:53,000
Rym: any logged in user can dig anything.

651
00:45:53,482 --> 00:45:54,808
Rym: So podcasts are no exception.

652
00:45:54,908 --> 00:45:57,600
Rym: if you dig a podcast it's dig count goes up by one.

653
00:45:57,701 --> 00:45:59,498
Rym: It is dug is now listed under your dude.

654
00:45:59,982 --> 00:46:03,399
Rym: Yeah, it says that you have dug this podcast and list all the people who have dug it.

655
00:46:04,482 --> 00:46:14,967
Scott: If you are not an active user of dig meaning you don't log in Periodically at least every two weeks like let's say I make a dig account just to dig my podcast But then I'm not actually a dig user.

656
00:46:15,008 --> 00:46:16,353
Scott: I don't use dig every day.

657
00:46:16,434 --> 00:46:17,258
Scott: You know, I don't I don't.

658
00:46:17,478 --> 00:46:18,705
Scott: what the hell Do I care about this site?

659
00:46:18,725 --> 00:46:21,340
Scott: I just came to make my podcast more popular and now I'm gone.

660
00:46:21,681 --> 00:46:31,013
Rym: Now what dig does is if you dig a podcast specifically if you are podcast episode Yeah, and you don't log in for two weeks day or use dig for two weeks.

661
00:46:31,495 --> 00:46:32,860
Rym: It will take away your dig.

662
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:38,940
Rym: It'll keep it listed in your profile and everything but your dig will not count in terms of how popular that podcast is.

663
00:46:39,522 --> 00:46:49,600
Rym: so if you want to spam podcast votes you have to Regularly maintain all of the accounts on dig you made and log into them all the time and be active on them.

664
00:46:49,861 --> 00:46:50,282
Scott: You have to.

665
00:46:50,322 --> 00:46:55,497
Scott: basically it only counts the digs for active real dig users.

666
00:46:55,578 --> 00:46:57,739
Rym: No, it's not awesome It's not stupid about it.

667
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:03,018
Rym: So let's say I use dig and I don't log in for a month because I'm living in Germany for a month.

668
00:47:03,038 --> 00:47:03,580
Rym: for some reason.

669
00:47:04,262 --> 00:47:14,353
Rym: If I then come home and I log back into dig after it's all over as soon as I log in all the podcasts I dug that lost my vote automatically get my vote back because I came back to dig.

670
00:47:14,734 --> 00:47:16,720
Scott: Yeah, it's actually pretty cool.

671
00:47:16,983 --> 00:47:18,360
Scott: There's a plus and a minus to it.

672
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:24,964
Scott: The plus is that you don't have to keep digging stuff and you actually get a pretty good fair popularity measure.

673
00:47:25,004 --> 00:47:26,148
Scott: that is difficult to scam.

674
00:47:26,629 --> 00:47:40,088
Scott: the minus is that you're only finding out what Podcasts are the most popular in the dig community and not what podcasts are the most popular period but that is definitely digs goal In in pot in this podcast thing and dig in general.

675
00:47:40,168 --> 00:47:43,419
Rym: dig wants its own community and it's it has its own community now.

676
00:47:44,083 --> 00:47:46,699
Scott: So you should be in that community because that's where the action is.

677
00:47:47,021 --> 00:47:52,680
Rym: So when they make like this podcast thing, they're made very specifically making it so anyone can use it.

678
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:53,524
Rym: I mean, it's beta now.

679
00:47:53,584 --> 00:47:54,428
Rym: So you need an account.

680
00:47:54,488 --> 00:47:56,739
Rym: even look at it, but eventually accounts are free.

681
00:47:57,222 --> 00:48:00,720
Rym: Yeah, sign up like every other web and eventually it's just gonna be on the site.

682
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:11,737
Rym: You don't even need to log in to look at it, too But you have to be an active dig participant in order to have a say on did Mm-hmm, and that seems to be digs biggest strength.

683
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,627
Scott: Yep Now the two other.

684
00:48:13,788 --> 00:48:14,291
Rym: yeah, we won't.

685
00:48:14,311 --> 00:48:25,900
Scott: we don't need to talk about digs specifically now but the two other features of the Podcasting thing that I think really make it shine and make it useful for finding new podcasts or number one It shows you up and coming podcast.

686
00:48:26,061 --> 00:48:40,140
Scott: So, you know, of course the front page is only gonna have the awesome stuff of all time But if something recently is like gaining a lot of ground down in the grassroots and it has a lot of digs Relative like it's getting digs at a rapid rate If not in great quantity.

687
00:48:40,661 --> 00:48:50,538
Scott: You'll see it show up there and then you might find it and start digging it which will then cause it to come up and that's a thing a lot of other websites have not done.

688
00:48:50,619 --> 00:48:55,520
Scott: is Provided some it's basically impossible for the podcast that starts small to get big.

689
00:48:55,681 --> 00:48:57,779
Scott: It keeps the big guys up in the small guys down.

690
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:03,240
Scott: This allows the small guys to get up while keeping the big guys on top where they rightfully belong.

691
00:49:03,461 --> 00:49:15,338
Rym: but yet at least so far it seems like the ones that get the up and coming are Ones that are actually good and up and coming and not iTunes where a lot of times ones that are listed as new or up and coming Not so much.

692
00:49:15,822 --> 00:49:22,642
Scott: The other thing that I like that it does is if you click on a podcast It shows you on the right hand side If like.

693
00:49:22,703 --> 00:49:32,664
Scott: if I go to the page for GeekNights on the right side You'll see the most popular episodes of GeekNights because when you find a new podcast you listen to what the most recent episode Which is good and bad.

694
00:49:32,684 --> 00:49:36,060
Rym: I mean, sometimes you get the gold but sometimes you get like our throwaway Thursday.

695
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:38,307
Scott: Yeah, sometime you listen to the most recent episode.

696
00:49:38,347 --> 00:49:40,193
Scott: Sometimes you might listen to the first episode.

697
00:49:40,254 --> 00:49:44,360
Rym: this bit me with dragons landing because Multiple people were telling me to listen.

698
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:48,937
Rym: So I finally check out dragons landing right and it was kind of meh and I was like what.

699
00:49:48,977 --> 00:49:49,700
Rym: that wasn't so good.

700
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,604
Rym: That was kind of boring.

701
00:49:51,045 --> 00:49:53,836
Rym: and then Scott's like which episode did you listen to?

702
00:49:53,856 --> 00:49:54,700
Rym: and I'm like, oh this one.

703
00:49:55,081 --> 00:50:03,374
Rym: And it turned out that the one episode of all the episodes they had up that I listened to Happened to be a special episode with two guest hosts.

704
00:50:03,535 --> 00:50:04,440
Rym: It wasn't a normal dragon.

705
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:10,139
Scott: Notice how when we don't have a normal GeekNights we say at the beginning of the episode This is not a normal GeekNights.

706
00:50:10,363 --> 00:50:11,239
Scott: They didn't do that.

707
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:16,776
Scott: So Rym thought it was a normal dragons landing when it was actually other people doing dragons landing.

708
00:50:16,796 --> 00:50:21,300
Scott: like the one time the movies You should see people did GeekNights, which once again was fantastic.

709
00:50:21,681 --> 00:50:25,416
Scott: Awesome, but we had to put a disclaimer letting people know it was going on.

710
00:50:25,456 --> 00:50:26,420
Scott: so they weren't confused.

711
00:50:26,661 --> 00:50:29,595
Rym: How come ribbon Scott are British and Scott's a woman?

712
00:50:29,675 --> 00:50:30,720
Rym: and what's going on?

713
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:38,139
Scott: Yeah but dig when you click on a podcast it shows you on the right hand side the most popular episodes of that podcast.

714
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:39,384
Scott: so You know this.

715
00:50:39,585 --> 00:50:48,800
Scott: this is why this is so good is because number one if you find a new podcast You can listen to the best episode right away and you'll know if that's something you're gonna listen to or not based on one episode.

716
00:50:49,661 --> 00:51:03,413
