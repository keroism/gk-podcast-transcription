1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,849
Scott: It's Tuesday, August 22nd, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,371 --> 00:00:17,000
Scott: Tonight, we discuss ludicrously casual role-playing games.

3
00:00:18,461 --> 00:00:19,478
Scott: Let's do this!

4
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,120
Rym: Well, I am the proud winner of a game of Amon Raye by exactly one point.

5
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,134
Scott: Ehh... I just, I tried to get money, but I couldn't.

6
00:00:28,898 --> 00:00:29,280
Scott: I don't know.

7
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:36,499
Rym: Well, not to imply anything, but Scott was not in second place since Alex is living with us currently, and uh... It was between me and him pretty much.

8
00:00:37,062 --> 00:00:37,864
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

9
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:42,860
Scott: There's just something with Amon Raye, like, I kind of know what to do, but I just can't.

10
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,526
Scott: I mean, if you really think about it, I was, uh... Let's see, maybe 12 points behind.

11
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:52,397
Scott: It is possible that I could have gotten four power cards.

12
00:00:52,437 --> 00:00:53,220
Scott: that would have put me up.

13
00:00:54,061 --> 00:00:56,860
Rym: You weren't eligible, however, for any power cards.

14
00:00:57,442 --> 00:00:59,100
Scott: I was in the first kingdom.

15
00:01:00,683 --> 00:01:02,719
Scott: I just didn't get the ones I was eligible for.

16
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:04,620
Scott: But, eh, what are you gonna do?

17
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:05,230
Rym: Lose.

18
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:05,361
Rym: Yep.

19
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,053
Rym: Yeah, that was really the only leader bit I had today.

20
00:01:09,074 --> 00:01:09,939
Rym: It was kind of a slow day.

21
00:01:11,361 --> 00:01:12,506
Scott: It was really slow today.

22
00:01:12,526 --> 00:01:16,200
Scott: I mean, I didn't even... I don't think I did anything today until the fight.

23
00:01:17,746 --> 00:01:18,178
Scott: Pretty sad.

24
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,588
Rym: Uh, yeah, you didn't really do anything.

25
00:01:20,608 --> 00:01:22,820
Rym: I came home, and you're already sitting in your room doing nothing.

26
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,693
Scott: You think I was doing something in the room.

27
00:01:25,754 --> 00:01:26,520
Scott: I don't remember what.

28
00:01:27,681 --> 00:01:28,263
Rym: Yeah, whatever.

29
00:01:28,283 --> 00:01:29,850
Rym: We have some news at least.

30
00:01:30,212 --> 00:01:38,100
Rym: Now, this again is somewhat old news, but I think I have to talk about it, and I have to talk about it for the same reason that I occasionally still have to talk about Jack Thompson.

31
00:01:39,161 --> 00:01:44,739
Rym: In fact, I recently posted on Slashdot to describe the Jack Thompson rule of media, which I now ascribe to.

32
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:57,900
Rym: Essentially, when someone like Jack Thompson or Sony is so stupid, and they do stupid things in the news all the time, you can't report on them every time they do something stupid anymore, because that's just, well, stupid.

33
00:01:58,922 --> 00:02:01,799
Rym: So what you do is you report on the first stupid thing they do.

34
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:13,879
Rym: If they do something else stupid, and they keep doing stupid things, you can't talk about it or say anything on the air or write a comment about it, unless the thing they just did tops everything else they've done.

35
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,710
Scott: Well, occasionally, I mean, someone does one stupid thing in their life.

36
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,896
Scott: You say, "That guy did a stupid

37
00:02:19,917 --> 00:02:20,118
Scott: thing.".

38
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:26,259
Scott: Then if they start a cycle of stupidity after like three or four things, that's when you stop doing each individual one.

39
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,680
Rym: If it's technical, you could say there's this equation and all these factors.

40
00:02:29,781 --> 00:02:33,440
Rym: There's a number, and if the number is above a threshold, you can talk about it.

41
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:42,760
Rym: And the stupidity of the act that would warrant being spoken of would decrease over time the longer it's been.

42
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,799
Rym: So if Sony didn't do anything stupid for a year, and then they did something stupid, it could be a much less stupid thing, and I'd still talk about it.

43
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:58,000
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it does get kind of tricky, though, because let's say you have someone like Jack Thompson, who just does things that are more and more incredibly stupid.

44
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,480
Rym: At this point, Jack Thompson would have to kill a child for me to talk about it.

45
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,720
Scott: Yeah, I mean, but everything, let's say, you know, he just keeps doing stupider and stupider things, right?

46
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,739
Scott: And you won't report on the mildly stupid things he does.

47
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,320
Scott: I mean, relative to the, you know, it's like, yeah.

48
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:25,160
Rym: See, with the Jack Thompson rule, if you have invoked it on something, then you can assume that that entity or person has been doing constant, minor, stupid things for the entirety of the time.

49
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:25,421
Rym: Right,

50
00:03:25,462 --> 00:03:43,297
Scott: but what I'm saying is a minor, stupid thing for Jack Thompson, you know, compared to Jack Thompson's other stupid acts, and then you take that same minorly stupid act on the Jack Thompson scale and compare it to a stupid act of some other person, and that other person might have done only one stupid thing.

51
00:03:43,358 --> 00:03:47,700
Scott: that was basically nothing compared to the average stupidity of Jack Thompson.

52
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,796
Scott: So do you not report on the other person's...

53
00:03:50,361 --> 00:03:56,420
Rym: No, no, it only applies to one entity, because once someone-- But now you're not reporting on these incredibly stupid things.

54
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:11,295
Rym: No, it doesn't matter, because once you've invoked the Jack Thompson rule, you're basically telling the world, "The person I am no longer talking about is so stupid, you could probably just make up a stupid story every day, and it's probably true, or at least true in

55
00:04:11,356 --> 00:04:11,839
Rym: magnitude.".

56
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:19,140
Rym: That is the Jack Thompson rule, and Sony has once again allowed me to make fun of the PS3 launch.

57
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:20,200
Scott: Oh my god.

58
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:27,199
Rym: By admitting a few days ago to GameSpot that they have not, in fact, started production of the PS3.

59
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:28,386
Scott: Wow.

60
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:34,097
Rym: They have not yet begun to start making PlayStation 3s.

61
00:04:35,704 --> 00:04:36,734
Rym: It's the end of August.

62
00:04:38,724 --> 00:04:39,763
Scott: They said-- But you know what?

63
00:04:39,823 --> 00:04:43,100
Scott: No, it's cool, because look, it's gonna come out in November, right?

64
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,220
Rym: Alright, alright, they said they're going to have two million units.

65
00:04:49,104 --> 00:04:50,500
Scott: I don't think they're going to have two million units.

66
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:55,680
Scott: I think they're going to have the exact same number of units as people demand, which is very few.

67
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:02,678
Rym: See, now a lot of people were trying to justify this, saying that, "Oh, it's just-in-time manufacturing, and this is planned from the

68
00:05:02,718 --> 00:05:03,000
Rym: start.".

69
00:05:03,901 --> 00:05:13,058
Rym: And there are a lot of reasons why I'm dubious of this claim, and all I'd really like to say is that I really think Sony fucked something up, and they don't know what to do.

70
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,560
Scott: Sony's just fucking everything up.

71
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:18,360
Scott: Is there an intelligent person at that company at all, anywhere?

72
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:26,699
Rym: Uh, you know, the people who design Sony hardware tend to be pretty smart, because a lot of Sony hardware would be really cool if they didn't cripple it with DRM.

73
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:28,300
Scott: Yeah, I guess, maybe.

74
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:35,079
Rym: Except for this recording bit, which was cool, except one, it had DRM, and then two, Adam dropped it and it immediately broke.

75
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,499
Rym: Uhh... Immediately.

76
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,068
Scott: Yeah, well, you know what I heard?

77
00:05:39,592 --> 00:05:43,320
Rym: I heard that-- Sony can't have an orgasm unless it kills a dog.

78
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,674
Scott: Well, no, I heard that Nintendo's making, like, hoechillion Wiiis, and they're already making Wiiis right now.

79
00:05:48,855 --> 00:05:49,299
Scott: Lots of 'em.

80
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,260
Scott: And we're gonna be-- we're gonna have more Wiiis than we know what to do with.

81
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,520
Scott: You're gonna be able to just go to the store and get one without worry.

82
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,459
Rym: It'll be like that guy on Farqua had two Wiiis.

83
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,220
Scott: Heh, lol.

84
00:05:59,922 --> 00:06:04,437
Rym: You know, I don't think I like this trend of you saying "lol" in a non-ironic way when you're not typing it.

85
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,560
Scott: Speaking of Wiiis, I got a Wii News.

86
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,657
Rym: A Wii News?

87
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,791
Scott: Nintendo hired this company.

88
00:06:11,812 --> 00:06:12,820
Scott: I forget the name of the company.

89
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,149
Rym: Yup.

90
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:19,420
Scott: And the company's job is to throw these exclusive, private, secret parties.

91
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:21,640
Scott: And they're Wii parties.

92
00:06:22,681 --> 00:06:31,780
Rym: And I think the way it works, according to what I've read-- All I can say is that if I were throwing a Wii party, it would probably not be anything like what Nintendo thinks a Wii party is.

93
00:06:31,983 --> 00:06:32,217
Scott: Yeah.

94
00:06:32,681 --> 00:06:37,620
Scott: I think the way it works, based on what I read, is that this company goes around picking people they know are cool.

95
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:43,280
Scott: And each of those cool people gets to invite, like, 30 friends to the Wii party.

96
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,052
Scott: And then they, you know, get a bus, and they bus the people "rave

97
00:06:48,072 --> 00:06:48,172
Scott: style."

98
00:06:50,803 --> 00:06:51,600
Scott: Rave style?

99
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,359
Scott: Rave style.

100
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,140
Rym: What the hell is rave style?

101
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,900
Scott: I don't know, but I guess they bus people to raves.

102
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,000
Rym: I've seen ravers rent school buses because I once or twice have seen a school bus full of ravers drive by.

103
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:11,060
Scott: Maybe, but they bus people rave style to a secret location where there are Wiiis to play and a party going on.

104
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:17,480
Rym: All right, now I can see partly why you might want this to be the news, because we're kind of cool.

105
00:07:18,341 --> 00:07:28,120
Rym: So if any of our listeners out there are going to one of these Wii parties and have 20 or so invitations, the front row crew would love to make an appearance.

106
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:36,240
Scott: What's happening is on the internet, people are posting the places and the times-- well, the cities and times of the Wii parties.

107
00:07:36,341 --> 00:07:38,680
Scott: But of course, no one knows the exact location.

108
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,238
Rym: Yeah, that's real-- New York City, 8 o'clock.

109
00:07:41,741 --> 00:07:46,959
Scott: That's pretty much what they're posting on the net, and people are trying to go to the Wii parties now.

110
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,860
Scott: They're not so secret, but I think that was sort of intentional.

111
00:07:51,085 --> 00:07:51,940
Rym: Yeah, it's one of those--.

112
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:56,720
Scott: It's like, you know there's a secret, but you can't find out all the information to take advantage of it.

113
00:07:56,961 --> 00:07:57,276
Rym: Ah ha ha.

114
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,619
Rym: It's a secret to everyone.

115
00:07:59,100 --> 00:07:59,500
Scott: Exactly.

116
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,280
Rym: Things of the day.

117
00:08:09,261 --> 00:08:13,720
Rym: Wow, usually you say something after I say that wacky radio "things of the day" kind of thing.

118
00:08:13,841 --> 00:08:16,660
Scott: I tried not to say something this time, and I succeeded.

119
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:17,479
Rym: Yeah, you did.

120
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,600
Rym: You succeeded in not saying anything.

121
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,045
Scott: Thingy.

122
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,178
Rym: Thingy, thingy, thingy, patang, zoop.

123
00:08:25,224 --> 00:08:35,139
Rym: All right, now back when we were at RIT and we were sophomores, we watched this video-- we might have been juniors, I don't remember-- but we were in our apartment, and someone showed us this Counter-Strike video.

124
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,779
Rym: It was basically a few-minute movie with incredibly high production values.

125
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:43,500
Rym: I mean, it was basically the theatrical Counter-Strike.

126
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:52,240
Rym: It was really badass, it ended in a crazy knife fight, and I wanted that to be my thing of the day today, except I don't remember what it was called at all.

127
00:08:53,461 --> 00:08:54,306
Rym: There's no way.

128
00:08:54,326 --> 00:09:01,899
Rym: I have my browsing history from what would be half a decade ago, and I have absolutely no way to find this video.

129
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,560
Rym: So instead, I found this other Counter-Strike video.

130
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,018
Scott: Well, I found it and showed it to you.

131
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:13,839
Rym: All right, what was just cut out there was Scott trying to claim that he showed me this video, when in fact, I found it independently of him.

132
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:20,879
Scott: Well, I saw it before he did, and then he saw it, and because I had seen it already, and then I thought I showed it to him.

133
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:25,779
Rym: Huh, so once again, the faulty memory comes up, and you remember something incorrectly.

134
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:26,538
Scott: Whatever.

135
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,085
Scott: Yeah.

136
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,359
Rym: Anyway, I found this other Counter-Strike video while I was looking for that first Counter-Strike video.

137
00:09:33,242 --> 00:09:37,940
Rym: This video was not nearly as high quality, but it is absolutely hilarious.

138
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,220
Rym: Just skip the first, I don't know, 30 seconds of it.

139
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:46,960
Scott: Yeah, at the beginning of the movie, it shows this kid playing Counter-Strike, and he slowly transforms into a counter-terrorist.

140
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:53,600
Scott: Yeah, wait-- But you get the idea pretty much right away, but they spend like a minute or two, and it drags out.

141
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,680
Rym: Yeah, way to go, Captain Director.

142
00:09:56,061 --> 00:09:57,700
Rym: We know that you've learned all these film techniques.

143
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,359
Rym: You really should have cut that scene into about a quarter of what it was.

144
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,779
Scott: Yeah, but as soon as he becomes a counter-terrorist, hilarity ensues.

145
00:10:04,142 --> 00:10:07,880
Scott: So just skip ahead until you see guys with guns.

146
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:13,338
Rym: Now, one, this is not at all amusing unless you have played Counter-Strike enough to get all the jokes.

147
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:14,619
Scott: Pretty much.

148
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,640
Rym: I mean, I was watching it.

149
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,279
Rym: It was funny, but it was standard, typical high quality video funny.

150
00:10:21,241 --> 00:10:31,719
Rym: Until about halfway, maybe 2/3 of the way through, when there are a whole bunch of inside Counter-Strike jokes all in a row about hostages and such, and I lost it.

151
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,080
Scott: Yeah, it was pretty awesome.

152
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,680
Scott: It was really good.

153
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:52,559
Rym: But if anyone knows anything about the other Counter-Strike video that I just mentioned, the crazy, realistic one that ends in the awesome knife fight and the counter-terrorist getting his throat slit, let me know, because not only will that be a thing of the day, but I will give you some sort of non-monetary, non-tangible reward.

154
00:10:53,683 --> 00:10:56,980
Scott: Oh, I'm sure that'll bring him out.

155
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,340
Rym: Well, the thing is, we haven't made our swag yet.

156
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,140
Rym: We've already promised swag to a lot of people.

157
00:11:01,522 --> 00:11:05,339
Rym: So I'm going to hold off on promising more swag until we actually have swag.

158
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,360
Scott: All right.

159
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:12,520
Scott: So my thing of the day is stand-up comedy from Japan.

160
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,580
Scott: Well, it's more like sit-down comedy, because the guy isn't actually standing.

161
00:11:16,624 --> 00:11:19,260
Scott: But this guy's on stage, and he's got a projector there.

162
00:11:20,022 --> 00:11:25,399
Scott: And he has a game of white color, and he's playing Tetris, or at least he's pretending to play Tetris.

163
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,420
Scott: And on the projector, you can see the game of Tetris he's playing.

164
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,879
Scott: Now, it starts out in level one, and he drops a piece, and it disappears.

165
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,120
Scott: He drops another piece, and it disappears.

166
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:43,760
Rym: And of course, if you've ever played Tetris, which if you haven't played Tetris, why the hell are you listening to GeekNights?

167
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,738
Scott: What the hell's wrong with you?

168
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:45,720
Rym: Good God.

169
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:52,540
Rym: It's like saying I've never seen Star Wars, or-- I've never eaten an apple or a banana.

170
00:11:53,923 --> 00:11:54,699
Scott: That's what it's like.

171
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,199
Rym: Well, there's one guy on Far Crystinly who was insisting, and he was an old man.

172
00:11:58,461 --> 00:11:59,580
Rym: He was an old man.

173
00:11:59,621 --> 00:11:59,990
Rym: He was in his 30s.

174
00:12:00,801 --> 00:12:04,560
Rym: He was insisting that he had never in his life played any form of video game.

175
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,597
Scott: Oh, that's fun.

176
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,000
Rym: Yeah, well, I found it dubious, and I figured he was a troll.

177
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,260
Rym: And two, I couldn't really care so much.

178
00:12:12,221 --> 00:12:13,080
Rym: Anyway, anyway.

179
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,119
Scott: Anyway, so it starts off like that.

180
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,019
Scott: So then he gets pissed off, and he says some funny things in Japanese.

181
00:12:19,181 --> 00:12:21,840
Scott: And if I understood Japanese, it'd probably be even more funny.

182
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:22,717
Rym: You know what?

183
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:29,080
Rym: Knowing Japanese or not knowing Japanese has almost no impact on finding this hilarious or not finding this hilarious.

184
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,540
Scott: It's funny if you don't know Japanese, but if you do, I'm sure it's more funny.

185
00:12:33,104 --> 00:12:34,020
Scott: It's kind of like a booster.

186
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:34,659
Rym: See, I don't know.

187
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,980
Rym: By the same token, it might be less funny.

188
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,120
Scott: If you find people saying things in Japanese funny, then yes.

189
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:46,480
Rym: Well, no, I mean, let's say that-- a good example is there are some songs I like in Japanese.

190
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,219
Rym: There are a couple songs that I really, really like, and I thought they were really cool.

191
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:57,539
Rym: And one day, I read what the lyrics actually meant, and they were the most vapid, asinine crap I'd ever seen.

192
00:12:58,183 --> 00:13:03,579
Rym: And until I knew what the words were, I had such a greater appreciation for the song.

193
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:08,320
Scott: Yeah, but I think, according to some people who do know Japanese, they said the guy was saying funny things.

194
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,700
Rym: Yeah, the guy seemed pretty funny.

195
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,600
Scott: Anyway, so in level two, he starts playing.

196
00:13:14,062 --> 00:13:15,879
Scott: He got pissed off at the game, and he plays level two.

197
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,800
Scott: And a horizontal line comes down the screen, lands, and disappears.

198
00:13:22,361 --> 00:13:23,680
Rym: Now, it just goes on from there.

199
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,659
Rym: It's basically stand-up comedy, where he's pretty much just playing Tetris funnily.

200
00:13:30,201 --> 00:13:34,000
Scott: Yeah, basically he's playing Tetris, but each level is screwed up in some way.

201
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:38,220
Rym: And it's-- It's screwed up in a way that would be funny to a gamer.

202
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,740
Scott: It would be funny to someone who played Tetris.

203
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:50,600
Scott: And you know what's the greatest part about this is it shows that that kind of thing in America is only funny to gamer nerds, the kind of people who make Katamari balls and roll them down the street.

204
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,639
Scott: But in Japan, that's like prime time TV.

205
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:55,700
Scott: Everyone finds it funny.

206
00:13:56,681 --> 00:14:00,580
Rym: Yeah, we could make all sorts of generalizations about the two cultures at this point.

207
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,338
Scott: And America sucks.

208
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:08,460
Rym: Well, I guess the best way to show-- I mean, it's so obvious that there's this link here, because look at American geek culture.

209
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:16,740
Rym: Japanese culture and Japanese things figure very highly into many, many, many geeks' lives in America.

210
00:14:17,683 --> 00:14:20,060
Scott: Yep, mostly in the anime and video game departments.

211
00:14:20,241 --> 00:14:21,940
Scott: Not so much the role-playing game departments.

212
00:14:22,022 --> 00:14:22,698
Rym: No, not so much.

213
00:14:23,222 --> 00:14:25,139
Scott: No, but mostly the animes and the video games.

214
00:14:25,301 --> 00:14:27,580
Rym: Yeah, but those are two of the pillars of geekery.

215
00:14:27,921 --> 00:14:29,759
Scott: And also the live-action Asian cinemas.

216
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,900
Rym: Yes, which also seem to overlap heavily with the former two.

217
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:33,232
Scott: Yep.

218
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,394
Scott: OK.

219
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:44,280
Rym: Now, speaking of role-playing games, today we decided to depart a little bit from reviewing serious hardcore German board games or serious hardcore video games.

220
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,799
Scott: You mean Nintendo video games.

221
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,028
Scott: Yes.

222
00:14:46,941 --> 00:14:52,817
Rym: Well, someday we should do a whole show on what the words "Nintendo hard" mean to people who were born in the '80s.

223
00:14:53,844 --> 00:14:54,816
Rym: But that's a separate day.

224
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,359
Rym: Today, you want to introduce it?

225
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:57,996
Scott: All right.

226
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:06,500
Scott: Today we are going to talk about the genre of role-playing games which are not so serious.

227
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:28,080
Rym: Now, these range from games like Paranoia that are funny, but yet also social commentary and can be played seriously, to games like Hall that not only cannot be played, not only are the rules so utterly asinine that you cannot play them, but they were actually not meant to be played.

228
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,779
Rym: They were sold as rule books that were to be read for entertainment alone.

229
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:43,139
Scott: Yeah, I mean, sometimes when you want to do some tabletop role-playing, you want to do something serious with a fantasy, or you get a GURPS, or you get a D20 system game.

230
00:15:43,322 --> 00:15:43,899
Rym: Or a Burning Wheel.

231
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,253
Scott: Or a Call of Cthulhu, or a 7th Sea, or an L5R.

232
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:49,920
Rym: You make real characters.

233
00:15:50,663 --> 00:15:51,980
Rym: You look into the backstories.

234
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,480
Rym: There's a complex rule system that actually works through the story you're trying to tell.

235
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,219
Rym: And as a group, you tell your story.

236
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,800
Rym: And it's usually really good, and series end takes forever.

237
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:02,448
Scott: Yep.

238
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,080
Scott: But sometimes, you get a group of people together.

239
00:16:07,165 --> 00:16:12,380
Scott: You want to do some role-playing, but you don't have time to sit around for hours making characters.

240
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:13,300
Scott: It's late at night.

241
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,180
Scott: You don't already have a campaign running with these people.

242
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,600
Scott: And you're not in the mood for something serious.

243
00:16:19,984 --> 00:16:21,400
Scott: You're in the mood to laugh a whole lot.

244
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,119
Scott: You're being silly.

245
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,857
Scott: You're getting drunk.

246
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,520
Rym: Yep, you got a heterogeneous group, or maybe not everyone knows the same systems.

247
00:16:27,961 --> 00:16:31,659
Rym: Or there are people who aren't comfortable making a D&D character on their own.

248
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,540
Scott: Maybe there's people who haven't role-played before.

249
00:16:33,841 --> 00:16:35,840
Scott: You know, you got to introduce them to tabletop gaming.

250
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,200
Scott: This is when you bust out the stupid game.

251
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,495
Rym: Now, you might be thinking, "Oh, they're just talking about beer and pretzels

252
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:42,798
Rym: D&D.".

253
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:50,419
Rym: No, this is definitely one step below beer and pretzels D&D, because beer and pretzels D&D is very rules-heavy.

254
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:51,915
Scott: Mm-hmm.

255
00:16:52,321 --> 00:16:54,580
Rym: We're talking, I mean, Kobolds Ate My Baby.

256
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,680
Scott: Yeah, we're going to go over a few examples of the ones that we've played.

257
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,840
Scott: There are a lot more out there.

258
00:16:59,203 --> 00:17:00,180
Scott: We just don't know a lot of them.

259
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,440
Rym: Yeah, well, I mean, I've played Paranoia.

260
00:17:02,787 --> 00:17:02,938
Rym: Yep.

261
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,660
Rym: And I've played Kobolds Ate My Baby.

262
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:04,936
Rym: Yep.

263
00:17:05,261 --> 00:17:06,560
Rym: You have played Pokethulu.

264
00:17:06,821 --> 00:17:07,780
Scott: I've played Pokethulu.

265
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,116
Rym: And Scott Johnson and I have read Hall.

266
00:17:11,262 --> 00:17:14,579
Rym: I have never met a human being who has tried to play Hall.

267
00:17:15,063 --> 00:17:16,239
Scott: I'm sure we'll find one.

268
00:17:17,021 --> 00:17:31,520
Scott: If any of you out there have played Hall, you will get some sort of non-monetary-- All right, so before we go and talk about some of the actual games themselves, let's talk about a few things that are common across the board in this genre of non-serious role-playing.

269
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:34,640
Rym: Even though there are great exceptions to probably everything we're about to see.

270
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:34,836
Scott: There are.

271
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,540
Scott: But in general, the rules of all these games are very simple, you know?

272
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,440
Rym: Or very complex, but not really.

273
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,879
Scott: Yeah, like if they're complex, they're not actually complex.

274
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,860
Scott: They're just, they seem complex, you know?

275
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,860
Scott: Like, they'll just make up crazy bat shit, you know?

276
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,180
Scott: But playing the game isn't actually difficult or time consuming.

277
00:17:56,762 --> 00:17:58,140
Scott: It's just crazy to be silly.

278
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,139
Scott: It's not actually crazy difficult, like, you know.

279
00:18:01,461 --> 00:18:07,496
Rym: Yeah, actual events in the game will usually come down to something like, "Roll a D6, oh, you catch on

280
00:18:07,697 --> 00:18:08,119
Rym: fire."

281
00:18:08,445 --> 00:18:08,959
Rym: Exactly.

282
00:18:09,543 --> 00:18:11,320
Rym: Or, "Everyone points at someone.

283
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,774
Rym: "and whoever got pointed at the most

284
00:18:12,976 --> 00:18:13,360
Rym: dies.".

285
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:27,872
Scott: These games are generally very, very simple to play and someone who's never played a role-playing game before can pretty much pick it up, read the book in about, I don't think I've ever seen a book for any of these games that was meant to be played.

286
00:18:27,892 --> 00:18:29,899
Scott: that takes, you know, too long to read.

287
00:18:30,202 --> 00:18:32,660
Rym: I mean-- I never even looked at the book, The Cobalt's Ate My Baby.

288
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,399
Scott: Yeah, The Cobalt's Ate My Baby.

289
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,540
Scott: I mean, there's one, there's a hardcover one you can buy, but I have the original one here.

290
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:39,979
Scott: At least I think it's the original one.

291
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,999
Scott: It's just a little orange pamphlet, baby.

292
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,740
Scott: It's smaller than a Passover Seder booklet, a Haggadah.

293
00:18:47,243 --> 00:18:49,718
Scott: If you're a Jew, you know what that is and it's a small little book.

294
00:18:50,841 --> 00:18:53,934
Scott: It's basically a brochure if you really wanna get right down to it.

295
00:18:55,604 --> 00:19:06,240
Rym: Now, another big thing about these games that in many cases, they're designed so that the only person who actually needs to have even ever seen the rule book is the person running the game.

296
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,439
Rym: I mean, Cobalt's Ate My Baby, especially Paranoia.

297
00:19:09,924 --> 00:19:19,830
Rym: You can play Paranoia seriously where everyone knows their stuff and everyone makes a character, but most games of that are run where one guy says, "I'm gonna run a game of

298
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:20,436
Rym: Paranoia.".

299
00:19:20,921 --> 00:19:22,555
Rym: Five other people say, "What's

300
00:19:22,615 --> 00:19:23,180
Rym: Paranoia?".

301
00:19:23,502 --> 00:19:25,054
Rym: And then the first guy says, "Sit your ass

302
00:19:25,095 --> 00:19:25,437
Rym: down.".

303
00:19:26,002 --> 00:19:30,380
Scott: Yeah, that's one big thing about it is you're playing D&D, a D20 system game.

304
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,280
Scott: Anyone who's playing kinda needs to know how to play.

305
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,040
Scott: I mean, they have to know what spells they have available or else how do they know that they can cast them.

306
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,499
Scott: They have to know what actions are available for them to take.

307
00:19:41,382 --> 00:19:45,199
Scott: They have to know when they roll a D20, what numbers should they add to it.

308
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,260
Scott: so they report the correct number to the DM.

309
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,360
Rym: - Yep, or the exact opposite, which is just as tedious.

310
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:55,940
Rym: Everyone has to role play really, really well and play a really story-driven game.

311
00:19:56,021 --> 00:19:57,379
Rym: that takes a lot out of you mentally.

312
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,340
Scott: - In these sorts of games, the player doesn't have to know anything.

313
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:07,220
Scott: The DM will command them to roll dice and then tell them what happens as a result.

314
00:20:08,201 --> 00:20:14,099
Scott: Players basically just say whatever they wanna do and something works out because it's lighthearted and no one cares.

315
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:33,040
Rym: - Another big hallmark of these games is that they are often not directly competitive, but definitely there is some form of competition either among the players or the situation where it is the Dungeon Master versus the players as opposed to it is the Dungeon Master facilitating role playing for the players.

316
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,198
Scott: - Yes, it is always quite amusing to.

317
00:20:36,238 --> 00:20:45,080
Scott: you know, where the DM can control you know, many, many silly things and create lots of humorous situations which the players must fight.

318
00:20:46,503 --> 00:20:48,540
Scott: You know, it really depends, but yeah.

319
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,979
Rym: - Yeah, when there's four kobolds and one baby, you can bet that one of those PCs is going to get killed.

320
00:20:53,180 --> 00:21:01,260
Scott: - Yeah, that is the, I say the chief hallmark of this genre of game is frequent and repeated player death.

321
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:06,080
Rym: - And not along the line, I mean in most role playing systems, death is this big deal.

322
00:21:06,802 --> 00:21:07,454
Rym: My character died.

323
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,000
Scott: - There are people who consider dying in D&D to be losing.

324
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,098
Scott: I mean for people who think you can win and lose at D&D.

325
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,600
Rym: - Yeah, we've known some people over the years who couldn't deal with a character dying.

326
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,700
Rym: But then there are people, I mean they just take it really seriously.

327
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:30,080
Rym: A character dies and they treat it like a character in an anime they've been watching for two years died or a relative died in some cases.

328
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:37,140
Scott: - Yeah, but in these games, you pretty much die and respawn or die and make a new character all the time.

329
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:49,160
Rym: - In fact, in many cases, silliness is often encouraged to the point that a character will put themself in a situation knowing that they're going to die expecting some sort of hilarity to ensue.

330
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:50,951
Scott: - Yes, that is how we...

331
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,380
Rym: - These games are games where characters will often die on purpose.

332
00:21:55,921 --> 00:22:00,739
Scott: - Yep, they'll die for great justice and for the great humor of everyone else.

333
00:22:01,961 --> 00:22:09,520
Scott: - All right, let's start talking about Cobalt's Ate My Baby, which has a tagline of the beer and pretzels role playing game.

334
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,740
Scott: They're saying the as if it's the only one.

335
00:22:12,382 --> 00:22:15,240
Rym: - Yeah, no I think the beer and pretzels is Hackmaster.

336
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,118
Scott: - It could be, it could be.

337
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:22,640
Rym: - Even though Hackmaster, when I read it, I actually thought it was fake and that no one played it.

338
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,820
Rym: And the fact that people play it really frightens me a little bit.

339
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,260
Scott: - Yeah, but anyway, Cobalt's Ate My Baby is really simple.

340
00:22:29,401 --> 00:22:38,780
Scott: I mean, you make a Cobalt, which has six stats, strength, dex, agility, speed, com, I forget what com is, combat and intelligence.

341
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,220
Rym: - Now it's a lot like D&D at first in that you have these stats and you roll them up and you play.

342
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:49,240
Rym: The difference is that the Cobalt's, the way you generate them, are weak as shit.

343
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,680
Scott: - Yeah, they're basically nothing.

344
00:22:51,301 --> 00:22:55,400
Scott: I mean, you roll a bunch of random stats for your Cobalt, but really?

345
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:03,512
Rym: - Like if it were D&D, imagine if you were a character who has one hit point and has a rusty dagger that can do 0D4 damage.

346
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:12,800
Scott: - Yeah, every Cobalt has four skills by default, which is climb, hide, cook, and tumble.

347
00:23:12,944 --> 00:23:13,438
Scott: I got hiccups.

348
00:23:14,581 --> 00:23:16,379
Scott: And then they get two more random ones, I think.

349
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:17,818
Scott: You have traits.

350
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:24,600
Scott: Every Cobalt has the trait of bark like a Cobalt and heightened sense of smell, but then they get another random trait.

351
00:23:25,182 --> 00:23:27,739
Scott: And they have bogeys, which are sort of like negative traits.

352
00:23:28,101 --> 00:23:33,940
Scott: And every Cobalt has Fearless and tastes like chicken, 'cause Cobalt's tastes like chicken.

353
00:23:35,342 --> 00:23:37,419
Scott: And they get a random bogey, I guess.

354
00:23:38,362 --> 00:23:41,939
Scott: And you get weapons and armor and equipment and magic and all that kind of good stuff.

355
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,999
Rym: - The basic premise of the game is that you as the PCs are all Cobalt's.

356
00:23:46,705 --> 00:23:47,900
Rym: You want to eat babies.

357
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,180
Scott: - Well, you don't want to eat babies.

358
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:55,459
Scott: You want to get babies for the King Cobalt to eat at the ball or something like that.

359
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,279
Rym: - Yeah, well, you have to--.

360
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:59,140
Scott: He is having a party and he wants to have it tomorrow.

361
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,600
Scott: You need babies, big fat, tasty human babies.

362
00:24:02,643 --> 00:24:08,220
Rym: - So your goal is to bust into this village full of humans with big swords and pointy bits.

363
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,300
Scott: - And dogs.

364
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,940
Rym: - Guard dogs and--.

365
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:11,479
Scott: - And babies.

366
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,320
Rym: - Fucking hate guard dogs.

367
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,637
Scott: - Yeah, yeah.

368
00:24:16,242 --> 00:24:19,240
Scott: And you gotta get the babies and get them out.

369
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:27,479
Rym: - Now, basically, if a human sees you, your options are basically die or die in a funny way.

370
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:32,620
Scott: - Or don't die, but then die afterwards.

371
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,200
Scott: Delay death is another option.

372
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:41,420
Rym: - Yeah, and wasn't there some sort of system of points where whoever brings back the most babies wins and all sorts of weird stuff.

373
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:48,655
Scott: - Yeah, there's combat between the DM, who is called the mayor of the town 'cause he controls the townsfolk?

374
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:52,520
Scott: and such, to prevent the kobolds from getting enough babies.

375
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:57,699
Scott: There's also competition between the kobolds to get more babies than each other and all that sort of stuff.

376
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:10,779
Scott: And, you know, let's see, the default map has, what is this, 19 squares and each square contains, is a five by five grid of spots to stand on.

377
00:25:11,482 --> 00:25:15,839
Scott: And then in the back of the book, there is flavor text for all the different squares to tell you what's there.

378
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:24,360
Rym: - You know what, that's really another hallmark of games like that, in that in a normal game, the DM creates this vast world for you and he describes everything and you really get in the mood.

379
00:25:25,161 --> 00:25:30,299
Rym: This is the kind of game where the players will say, all right, I go to the village, give me some flavor text.

380
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:40,679
Scott: - Yep, exactly, and the flavor text is all there and it's really, you know, you don't have to be a good DM to run one of these things because generally the book is all you need.

381
00:25:41,141 --> 00:25:50,140
Scott: And that is a problem sometimes because you're relying on the humor of the author of the book to make this an enjoyable experience.

382
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:56,760
Scott: And once you've, you know, used all of that stuff with the same group of people, it's not going to be funny again.

383
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,553
Rym: I mean-- - We played "Cobalt's Eat My Baby" 1.5 times.

384
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:15,420
Scott: - Yeah, I mean, you play "Cobalt's Eat My Baby" with your friends and then it's not gonna be fun to play it again unless you make a new map or you come up with new jokes, you know, but the point is the game's fun because some really funny guy wrote the game.

385
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,279
Scott: Who did write this game?

386
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,499
Scott: Landis and O'Neill of the 9th Level Games.

387
00:26:20,502 --> 00:26:20,760
Scott: All right.

388
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:30,780
Rym: - Now the other fun, say, you know, you have eight friends and four of you have played "Cobalt's Eat My Baby" a bunch of times and then you play it with you four and then with these four newbies who have never seen the game before.

389
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,658
Scott: - Then it's gonna be fun.

390
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,060
Rym: - As long as there's one person who has never played whatever game it is, it is always hilarious.

391
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,240
Rym: - But it's gotta be a good person.

392
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,629
Scott: If it's a schmuck who's not into it, then it's not gonna work.

393
00:26:39,649 --> 00:26:40,560
Scott: - Well, yeah.

394
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:45,800
Rym: I mean, we played this game with Stinky Rob and despite that, it was great fun.

395
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:55,020
Scott: - Yep, another good idea is to, you know, you play it, you put it on the shelf and then a few years when everyone's forgotten it, you whip it out again and have the fun again.

396
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,418
Rym: - I gotta say, I'm kind of in the mood to play "Cobalt's Eat My

397
00:26:57,438 --> 00:26:57,519
Rym: Baby.".

398
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,800
Scott: - I am also kinda in the mood.

399
00:26:59,181 --> 00:27:02,099
Scott: The other thing is everyone really has to get into it and be silly.

400
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:12,080
Scott: If the people aren't acting silly, if they're kinda tired and bored, don't waste your time because you're just gonna use up all the well-written humor in the book and it's gonna go to waste.

401
00:27:12,781 --> 00:27:15,320
Scott: You know, you've gotta time it just right.

402
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,660
Rym: - Yep, it's a great game if you're in college to play on like a Saturday night.

403
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,340
Scott: - Yep, yep, perfect.

404
00:27:21,881 --> 00:27:22,679
Scott: With beer and pretzels.

405
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,397
Rym: - Yes.

406
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,339
Scott: - Many beer and pretzels.

407
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:32,019
Scott: I mean, just to give you an idea of something in this game, kobolds have magic, right?

408
00:27:32,702 --> 00:27:40,820
Scott: And basically, whenever they cast a spell, and all the spells are hilarious and result in hilarious effects, but if you cast a spell, you die.

409
00:27:41,844 --> 00:27:46,040
Scott: You check off a box on your kobold horrible death record.

410
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:52,360
Scott: In the bottom right of your character sheet, there's this little grid of squares called the kobold horrible death record.

411
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,919
Scott: And whenever you die, you just kinda check off a box.

412
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:55,660
Rym: - Yeah.

413
00:27:56,382 --> 00:27:57,340
Scott: - It's pretty awesome.

414
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:03,020
Rym: - Now, a much more serious game in some ways is Paranoia.

415
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,000
Scott: - Paranoia actually has a very large, like a book.

416
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,980
Scott: It's the same size as the D20, you know, Dungeons and Dragons Player's Handbook.

417
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:20,012
Scott: However, the first section of the book, I'd say the part that every player has to read is maybe 75 pages long.

418
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:21,900
Scott: - Yeah.

419
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,039
Scott: - And the rest of the book is for the GM.

420
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:36,920
Rym: - Now, you can play Paranoia very seriously, because Paranoia is a game that is basically set in a 1984, like, Brazil kind of dystopian big brother future.

421
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,280
Scott: - Yeah, I lied, it was 48 pages for the players to read.

422
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:54,879
Rym: Like imagine the most, like North Korea times a million, the most horribly oppressive 1984 world you can imagine, where this computer, this all powerful computer controls everything, and you live in this super, super terrible world.

423
00:28:55,902 --> 00:29:03,240
Rym: And there are people who play this game seriously, or who play this game straight up, and that is not what we're going to talk about right now.

424
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:07,140
Scott: - No, we were going to talk about the way we play Paranoia, which is for awesome.

425
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:15,559
Scott: See, the world of Paranoia is set up sort of like, I don't know, I can't really compare it to anything, like Paranoia.

426
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,160
Scott: - Yeah.

427
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,780
Scott: - There are colors for everything, and the lowest of low colors, I think, is orange.

428
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:21,579
Rym: - Ultraviolet.

429
00:29:22,301 --> 00:29:23,718
Rym: - No, ultraviolet is the worst.

430
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,340
Scott: - No, I think orange is even lower than infrared.

431
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,240
Rym: - No, it's not, it starts at infrared.

432
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,200
Rym: 80% of the citizens are infrared.

433
00:29:31,524 --> 00:29:33,919
Rym: They are drugged all the time, they're the menial proletariat.

434
00:29:34,521 --> 00:29:36,360
Rym: Then it is red, then it is orange.

435
00:29:36,601 --> 00:29:38,500
Rym: It follows in Roy G. Bibb fashion.

436
00:29:38,701 --> 00:29:39,658
Rym: I can't believe you.

437
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,900
Scott: - Oh, I don't really remember, but anyway.

438
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,480
Rym: - Of course, you actually hadn't heard of Paranoia until Luke ran that game.

439
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,479
Scott: - Yeah, that's right, and I got the book, but I haven't read a single word of it yet.

440
00:29:48,021 --> 00:29:49,099
Scott: I'm sitting here with it right now.

441
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,080
Scott: But anyway, Ultraviolet is the highest setting.

442
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:56,519
Rym: - Yeah, see, the thing is, I had known about Paranoia for a long, long time, and I thought it was awesome.

443
00:29:57,422 --> 00:30:01,240
Rym: Mostly because I'd gone to a lot of gaming conventions when I was very young, before I went to college.

444
00:30:02,002 --> 00:30:07,873
Rym: And I always met people who would talk about this game, Paranoia, and I'd always hear jokes like, "The computer is our

445
00:30:07,934 --> 00:30:08,319
Rym: friend.".

446
00:30:08,924 --> 00:30:12,540
Rym: And I started understanding all this funniness about this game that I'd never played.

447
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:17,860
Rym: And it wasn't until college, when our friend Luke ran a game of Paranoia, that I actually played it.

448
00:30:18,743 --> 00:30:20,960
Scott: - Yep, now, the colors are rankings.

449
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:28,080
Scott: And basically, if you're a rank, you have access to everything that is your rank and below, as makes sense.

450
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:35,218
Rym: - You are also immune to laser blasts from standard issue guns from anyone who has a rank lower than you.

451
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,000
Scott: - Yeah, so let's say I'm orange, and Rym is red.

452
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,639
Scott: Rym can touch red things.

453
00:30:41,221 --> 00:30:43,139
Scott: He can also touch infrared things.

454
00:30:43,701 --> 00:30:46,719
Scott: If he touches an orange thing, he is very likely to die.

455
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,879
Rym: - Unless no one sees.

456
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,939
Scott: - Unless no one sees.

457
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:56,740
Scott: Of course, the computer is watching, and you wouldn't disobey the computer, because touching an orange thing when you're red is disobeying the computer.

458
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,140
Rym: - Well, yes, the computer is my friend, and I am a happy citizen.

459
00:30:59,200 --> 00:30:59,695
Scott: - There you are.

460
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,320
Rym: - Are you a happy communist?

461
00:31:01,822 --> 00:31:03,274
Rym: - Oh, but--.

462
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:22,479
Rym: - Now, the basic, I'm not gonna go into the great detail here, and I might be a little off on the exact details, too, because it's been a while, but the premise of the world is that people built a supercomputer to run society and control the nukes, and there was a huge shelter underground to save people in the event of nuclear war.

463
00:31:23,201 --> 00:31:33,260
Rym: The computer's instructions were protect the people forever, there are communists out there, the communists want to destroy your people.

464
00:31:34,741 --> 00:31:52,299
Rym: Now, the computer sits there, all right, fine, I will protect everyone, and then it realizes that logically, it has to protect the people forever, and there are communists out there, they might attack, therefore, given infinite time, they will attack, therefore, I have to nuke everyone right now.

465
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:53,357
Scott: - And it did.

466
00:31:53,940 --> 00:32:01,240
Rym: - And then the computer is the only power in the world, so it now controls the entirety of society in the Alpha Complex, which is where you live.

467
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:11,040
Scott: - Yep, now, back to the colors, you know, you have the ultraviolet people, I don't know, I just lost where I was going completely.

468
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:19,180
Rym: - Yeah, we don't need to talk about the mechanics of the game very much, and in fact, I don't want to talk a lot about how paranoia works for one main reason.

469
00:32:19,921 --> 00:32:29,580
Rym: It seems that paranoia, the best way to experience this game is to not know anything about it, and have one person who knows everything about it.

470
00:32:29,722 --> 00:32:30,699
Rym: run a game for you.

471
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,560
Scott: - Yeah, I guess that is sort of true.

472
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:40,520
Rym: - Because paranoia, at least one of the great joys of the game is learning about the world, discovering how this fucked up world works.

473
00:32:41,040 --> 00:33:22,440
Rym: I mean, I'll ruin one tiny thing, that a lot of people will play this game, and this is how Luke ran the game for us, semi-LARP style, where you're sitting around a table, and there's all these things on the table, and those things are part of the game, you know, you say you gotta get instructions from the computers, you go to a kiosk, and you hit the button, and the instructions come out, so Luke being the computer, what he did is the instructions were written on a piece of paper, so he takes his hand in front of me, and he starts rolling the piece of paper out, like it's a kiosk, I go to grab it, and he starts rolling it back in, 'cause the computer broke, and I go, shit, and I try to grab it from him, and it rips, and now I have half a piece of paper, and it says like, the other half of a number, now what?

474
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:23,705
Scott: - Yeah.

475
00:33:23,726 --> 00:33:23,888
Scott: -

476
00:33:23,949 --> 00:33:38,160
Rym: Stuff like that, and as you, like, you'll learn how the game works by dying a lot, and I'd say that is probably the greatest joy of this game, is learning how the game works, and playing it for the first time, with a bunch of people who have never played before.

477
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:46,560
Scott: - Yeah, another thing you have to remember in this game is if you wanna play it correctly, everyone has a six-pack, a six-pack of beverages.

478
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,460
Rym: - Some sort of caffeinated beverage, usually.

479
00:33:48,940 --> 00:34:00,820
Scott: - Usually, something that's gonna make you pee, that's the idea, something that's gonna make you have to get up and go to the bathroom and leave the game, because what happens is every time you die, you open up one item in your six-pack.

480
00:34:01,202 --> 00:34:04,320
Scott: If you don't have anything left in your six-pack, you're done, go home.

481
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:13,299
Rym: - Because in the game, everyone is a clone, and any time a clone is made, there's a clone template, and one clone will be recreated up to six times.

482
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:24,139
Rym: So basically, you're walking, I keep saying basically, you're walking around outside, and your friend accuses you of being a communist, which you have to be wearing red, so you're kinda fucked at this point.

483
00:34:26,581 --> 00:34:29,099
Rym: So the computer sends a tactical nuke and kills you.

484
00:34:30,842 --> 00:34:32,335
Rym: And the rest of the party's like, "All right,

485
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:32,638
Rym: great.".

486
00:34:33,081 --> 00:34:39,380
Rym: And then two minutes later, the computer launches a capsule out with another clone of you, and the clone walks out and goes, "You bastards,".

487
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,159
Rym: and then you keep going.

488
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:49,539
Scott: - Yeah, and basically, when you die, you open up one of the beverages in your six-pack in real life, and you start drinking it.

489
00:34:49,802 --> 00:34:52,659
Scott: And when you finish drinking it, that's when you come back into the game.

490
00:34:52,800 --> 00:35:01,959
Scott: So if you wanna get back in the game real quick, you'll chug real fast, but if you wanna take your time, you'll just sip and wait for the right moment to finish off that last drop.

491
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:08,799
Rym: - Now, the game is called Paranoia, because one, you are afraid that the computer is going to see you do something bad and kill you.

492
00:35:09,303 --> 00:35:14,640
Scott: And if the game is run properly, it's almost impossible to not do something bad.

493
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:19,340
Scott: I mean, the computer will give you instructions, and you must obey the computer, or else you'll die.

494
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:25,060
Scott: But in order to execute those instructions, you'll have to do all sorts of other things, which disobey the computer.

495
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:31,660
Rym: - Now, in addition, usually the game is run wherein every one of the PCs has an ulterior motive.

496
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,699
Rym: I mean, you'll be given a mission.

497
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:38,694
Rym: You are basically, in most Paranoia games, a troubleshooter, meaning you are sent out to find trouble and shoot it.

498
00:35:40,481 --> 00:35:43,639
Rym: And as a result, you're out there, and you have your mission from the computer.

499
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:53,440
Rym: But in addition, a lot of people like to say that the Alpha Complex is a world where the computer protects everyone from the communists, yet everyone is secretly a communist.

500
00:35:54,542 --> 00:36:03,199
Rym: So every character will be given an ulterior mission, or they're a member of a secret cult or a secret society, or they're actually a communist, or they're a mutant or something.

501
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:09,659
Rym: So like, one character's mission is to kill this other character, but they can't just kill the other character outright, 'cause then they'll be killed.

502
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,720
Scott: - And the guy will come back six times, and you come back six times.

503
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,100
Scott: You can't just shoot him with a laser.

504
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:23,180
Scott: You gotta set up situations to force the other guy like, you know, to do something he's not supposed to do, or force him to disobey the computer.

505
00:36:23,842 --> 00:36:29,180
Scott: It's all about, you know, contradictory goals and being forced in a difficult situation.

506
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,473
Rym: - Yeah, like the simple ones, you walk up to someone and you say, "Are you a happy

507
00:36:32,534 --> 00:36:32,900
Rym: communist?".

508
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:34,155
Rym: And someone says, "What,

509
00:36:34,277 --> 00:36:34,479
Rym: no!".

510
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,831
Rym: And then you say, "You're not

511
00:36:35,912 --> 00:36:36,315
Rym: happy?".

512
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,350
Rym: "No, no,

513
00:36:37,391 --> 00:36:37,493
Rym: no!".

514
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,779
Rym: So then you're a communist, you point your finger, and then the computer kills them.

515
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,480
Scott: - Exactly.

516
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,397
Rym: - Things like that.

517
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,039
Scott: - That one gets a little old, though.

518
00:36:45,160 --> 00:37:02,040
Rym: - Well yeah, the thing is, early on, I don't wanna ruin, 'cause one thing about paranoia, and I've actually learned a lot of these secrets from playing in the game once and listening to other people talk, but there are a lot of things that the runner of the game is encouraged to do in order to make the game awesome.

519
00:37:02,682 --> 00:37:11,195
Rym: And the thing is, these things will only work once on a given person, 'cause then, if they ever play paranoia again, they'll know, "Oh, he's just doing the blah, blah, blah

520
00:37:11,236 --> 00:37:11,478
Rym: trick.".

521
00:37:11,887 --> 00:37:12,078
Scott: - Yup.

522
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:23,340
Scott: - But the one I think I can-- - That is why the first 48 pages of the Paranoia Rules book are infrared, and the GM section, which is the entire rest of the book, is ultraviolet.

523
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:32,239
Rym: - Now, the one I'll ruin, just to give you an example of how it works, this is a really basic one, is put the players in a dark room early on.

524
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,019
Scott: - Yup.

525
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:40,499
Rym: - Basically, put the players in a situation where they can get all that, "Oh my god, I really wanna kill someone," out of their system.

526
00:37:40,981 --> 00:37:48,360
Rym: So, you put 'em in a situation where the computer's not watching, and it is guaranteed that within a minute, probably everyone is going to die.

527
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:52,200
Scott: - So, they don't want to-- - Without any DM intervention.

528
00:37:52,623 --> 00:37:53,840
Rym: They're just gonna all kill each other.

529
00:37:54,001 --> 00:38:01,299
Scott: - Now, you can see why this is awesome, because, check it out, everyone wants to just escape the computer, because the computer will kill them if they do certain things.

530
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,019
Scott: So, as soon as they escape the computer, what do they all do?

531
00:38:04,242 --> 00:38:04,837
Scott: They all die.

532
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:10,590
Rym: - And then, basically, you all die, and you can say something like, "What did you

533
00:38:10,631 --> 00:38:10,937
Rym: learn?".

534
00:38:11,526 --> 00:38:18,300
Rym: And then the game continues, and there are a lot of tricks like this that make the game so awesome for someone who's never played it before.

535
00:38:19,301 --> 00:38:23,740
Scott: I guess the problem is, if you wanna run a campaign, it gets silly, but it's great for one shot.

536
00:38:24,564 --> 00:38:25,620
Scott: It takes a few hours, though.

537
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,580
Scott: It's not like a quick thing.

538
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:30,299
Scott: Like, "Cobalt's Ate My Baby," you can play in maybe a couple hours, maybe even one hour.

539
00:38:31,006 --> 00:38:31,660
Scott: It's pretty short.

540
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:36,300
Scott: But paranoia, you can get a whole night of action with one game of paranoia.

541
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:36,975
Rym: - Easily.

542
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:37,720
Scott: - Very easily.

543
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:41,200
Scott: If it's run well, and people don't die too often.

544
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:46,600
Scott: I mean, you gotta die a lot for paranoia to be awesome, but the idea is to have a lot of players.

545
00:38:46,721 --> 00:38:58,619
Scott: That way, someone is always dying, but it takes a very long time, hours, for people to actually be eliminated from the game entirely, unless someone is incredibly stupid, and then they must die right away.

546
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:10,640
Rym: - The best paranoia game seems to be where it ends, where maybe two of the original eight or 10 players are still alive, because the people who are dead, it is still hilarious to watch what is going on, even if you are out of the game.

547
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,520
Scott: - Even if you didn't start in the game.

548
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:20,159
Scott: If you're just a passerby, and you see some people playing paranoia, sit down and watch, because if they're doing a good job, it's gonna be high-larious.

549
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:24,520
Rym: - Now, if you ever go to a gaming con, now, I don't even mean like UberCon.

550
00:39:24,721 --> 00:39:29,020
Rym: I mean like an old-school pay-for-slots gaming con.

551
00:39:29,901 --> 00:40:03,020
Rym: Almost every one of them, in fact, every one I've ever been to, had a live-action paranoia that was going on continuously throughout the convention, which, you know, it would involve, I couldn't even go on to the hilarity, but don't think that paranoia ends once you've played it a couple times and you've learned all the tricks, because then you can play the next stage of paranoia, which is playing a game where everyone knows what's going on, and then it's either a battle of wits between all the players, which can be really cool, or it's a semi-serious or just much more streamlined game, and it's still really fun and a good one-off.

552
00:40:04,324 --> 00:40:11,900
Rym: If you're a nut, you can continue to the somewhat serious paranoia gaming, where you play campaigns, and it, that's a whole different topic.

553
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:25,140
Scott: - Yeah, and even if you don't plan on playing paranoia ever, hell, even if you don't plan on playing Caldwell's Eat My Behavior, any of the other games, I mean, we're gonna talk about Pocathulu quickly, get the books and read them, because they're hilarious to read, I mean--.

554
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:29,479
Rym: - However, if you ever plan to play paranoia, don't read the back of the paranoia book.

555
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,700
Scott: - Unless you're gonna be running the game.

556
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:40,760
Rym: - Yeah, but try to find someone else to run you a game first, otherwise you'll never get to experience that joy of having the computer totally fuck you in a way you've never anticipated.

557
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:54,259
Scott: - Yep, exactly, exactly, and you know, can we, Rym talked before about how games like Hall, you're not, you know, it's not meant to be played, you just read the book for humor, and the book happens to be an RPG rule book that is humorous.

558
00:40:55,260 --> 00:41:09,419
Scott: You know, the other games like Paranoia are also, you know, RPG rule books that are humorous, but they can be played, you know, it's so, you know, it's humorous to just read it, but also playing it is good, whereas Hall, humorous to read, don't play.

559
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:20,940
Rym: - Now, Pocathulu, we'll talk about briefly, I forget, I think I was on a date or something, but I wasn't around when everyone else played Pocathulu, I think it was you and Pete, and maybe Frank.

560
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:21,859
Scott: - I don't remember.

561
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,460
Rym: - I know it was you and Pete, at least.

562
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:27,198
Scott: - I was a little pirate kid with a little pirate boat and a little pirate Pokemon, Pocathulu.

563
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:33,718
Rym: - I remember that you guys explained how the game went, and that you had met a little girl and immediately killed her.

564
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,779
Scott: - Yep, something like that.

565
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,520
Rym: - It is basically Pokemon plus Cthulhu.

566
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:50,980
Scott: - Yes, it is, you were playing an RPG that's incredibly simple, I think it was like four small stats, and I forget what dice you used, 'cause I don't have the rule book, but I don't know what happened to that rule book that we had, it's a cheap game, you can buy it.

567
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,299
Rym: - It's like five or six bucks, I might just buy it again.

568
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,119
Scott: - Yeah, I mean, I think I might buy the better version of Cobalt's Ape My Baby also.

569
00:41:59,242 --> 00:42:13,340
Scott: But it's, you know, you're a trainer, you have some trainer stats, but you can't really do much, everything you do is your Pocathulu, which is a Pokemon, for all intents and purposes, only it's a very macabre Pokemon.

570
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,200
Rym: - Yeah, we're talking dark, with tentacles and killing.

571
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:24,580
Scott: - You know, normally Pokemon have stat, you know, they have a stat, or traits like fiery, or, you know, four-legged or flying.

572
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:32,860
Scott: You know, Pocathulu have those traits too, but they also have other traits like Squamous, and Tentacled, and other such things.

573
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:33,880
Rym: - Squamous.

574
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,260
Scott: - Yes, Squamous Pokemon, Pocathulus.

575
00:42:37,461 --> 00:42:55,338
Scott: So, you know, you're just playing a fun game in whatever kind of Pokemon trainer combat world you want, only all the Pokemon are Lovecraftian and kind of freaky, and you end up making a lot of jokes about tentacles and all that sort of stuff.

576
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:59,258
Rym: - Now, if you haven't ever read the works of H.P.

577
00:42:59,298 --> 00:43:03,360
Rym: Lovecraft and the Cthulhu Mythos, one, why are you listening to GeekNights?

578
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,479
Rym: Go read those books now.

579
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,540
Scott: - Yeah, seriously, I mean, have you never eaten bread?

580
00:43:08,941 --> 00:43:09,840
Scott: Why have you not read?

581
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:12,437
Rym: - Actually, we should do a show on H.P.

582
00:43:12,477 --> 00:43:12,880
Rym: Lovecraft.

583
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,279
Scott: - Write that down, someone.

584
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,480
Scott: - I re-stikied the thread because you guys complained.

585
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:21,040
Rym: - Well, the reason I un-stikied it-- - 'Cause there were just too many sticky threads.

586
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:21,723
Rym: - Yeah, that.

587
00:43:21,783 --> 00:43:29,559
Rym: and because it got a post pretty much every day because we always talk about something, but then the forums exploded last weekend and pushed that off the front page.

588
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:30,938
Scott: - Yep, so I re-stikied it.

589
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:32,758
Scott: You know, be joyous.

590
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:33,531
Scott: Anyway.

591
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,811
Rym: - Yeah, Pocathulu is just silly and fun, and H.P.

592
00:43:36,852 --> 00:43:37,480
Rym: Lovecraft is great.

593
00:43:37,843 --> 00:43:39,500
Rym: Now, we're not gonna talk much about Hall.

594
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,560
Rym: Hall stands for Human Occupied Landfill.

595
00:43:43,281 --> 00:43:48,340
Rym: I learned about it because I read a review about it in Dragon Magazine, and it sounded so hilarious.

596
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,040
Scott: - Are you sure it's pronounced Hall and not Hole?

597
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,319
Rym: - I've heard it, Hall.

598
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:52,054
Scott: - I don't know.

599
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:52,938
Scott: Who cares?

600
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:56,660
Rym: - Some scary old gamer at Michicon said Hall.

601
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,279
Scott: - Okay.

602
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:02,100
Rym: - Because he made a joke about the title of the chapter on combat in the game.

603
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:02,639
Scott: - All right.

604
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:09,880
Rym: - And the funny thing is that our friend, Scott Johnson, I mean, I've never met anyone else other than Scott and the scary old guy who really knew about Hall.

605
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,899
Rym: So if any of you have ever read it, let me know, 'cause that's cool.

606
00:44:14,001 --> 00:44:18,540
Rym: And if you haven't read it, and you see it for cheap, I'd recommend picking it up, 'cause it's kind of funny.

607
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:19,140
Scott: - Yeah.

608
00:44:20,142 --> 00:44:27,119
Scott: I'm sure there are lots of other games in this very important and very revered genre of RPGs, but I don't really know any of them.

609
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:32,120
Scott: But I'm sure if you look on Google and the internet, you'll find a whole mess of them.

610
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:33,679
Scott: I mean, I've seen some in the store.

611
00:44:34,281 --> 00:44:38,580
Scott: What was the, there was like, I'm trying to remember that one I saw on the shelf.

612
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:39,196
Scott: What was it?

613
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:40,920
Rym: - I don't think you're gonna remember.

614
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,459
Rym: If I had a thought bird, I'd play it.

615
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:43,180
Scott: - Yeah.

616
00:44:43,922 --> 00:44:51,080
Scott: There were some involving like mermaids, sluts, and another one involving like cows of some sort.

617
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:56,696
Rym: - Well, there's also this whole sub-genre of one-off party LARPs.

618
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:05,020
Rym: One, I forget what it was called, but there's one, the mermaid thing you said reminded me, where if you have a pool party, there's this LARP where everyone's a fish.

619
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:06,960
Scott: - Oh, it's like the shrimp whatever or something?

620
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,880
Rym: - I forget what it's called, but everyone gets a character with motives and there's barely any rules.

621
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,399
Rym: Like you paper rock scissors for anything and there isn't even much.

622
00:45:15,301 --> 00:45:19,599
Rym: And it's just this silly LARP that you can play while you happen to be in a pool for a few hours.

623
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:24,459
Scott: - Yeah, it's like a one-off fun time party in a box.

624
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:30,720
Rym: - I guess in closing, these games are absolutely fantastic.

625
00:45:31,221 --> 00:45:41,199
Rym: And if you really like role-playing, but you're not around people to role-play regularly anymore, but you see each other like once a month or once a year, that's when to bust these things out.

626
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:51,520
Scott: - Yeah, or if you're at a party and people are drunk, but not vomit drunk, or you're just, people are, they're kind of bored.

627
00:45:51,781 --> 00:45:53,379
Scott: There's nothing really happening at the party.

628
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,879
Scott: Everyone's just kind of sitting around, looking around.

629
00:45:56,925 --> 00:45:57,899
Scott: This is what you want to bust.

630
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:58,820
Rym: - Looking around, looking around.

631
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:04,980
Scott: - Exactly, I mean, sometimes you can bust out something like apples to apples, but that can only support so many people reasonably.

632
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:11,299
Rym: - Yeah, plus we can do a whole separate episode, again, all these other episodes, on party games, which are somewhat distinct from this.

633
00:46:11,801 --> 00:46:17,900
Scott: - Yes, but you can bust one of these types of things out and you'll create a good time out of nothing, easily.

634
00:46:19,001 --> 00:46:21,919
Scott: Especially if you got a bunch of nubs, especially non-gaming nubs.

635
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:33,080
Rym: - Well, anyway, to close out, tune in tomorrow, where once again we won't have news or thing of the day because we're going to finish our coverage of Otakon 2006.

636
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:43,180
Rym: Including, among other things, our long rant that I barely remember because it was very late when we recorded the most of it, about panels at cons and how we're not too happy with them anymore.

637
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:46,019
Scott: - Yeah, a lot of people seem to be agreeing with us, so.

638
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:52,359
Rym: - And I'm going to do everything I can with my staff-ly powers at the cons I have any influence over to try to rectify this.

639
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,140
Scott: - Yeah, there has to be a way.

640
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,700
Scott: The thing is, every, yeah, okay.

641
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,380
Scott: We'll let it be for tomorrow.

642
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,540
Rym: - Yes, so in closing, trust the computer.

643
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:01,119
Rym: The computer is your friend.

644
00:47:01,824 --> 00:47:02,054
Scott: Obey.

645
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:05,730
Rym: - Put on those sunglasses.

646
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:11,770
Rym: - And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

647
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:14,409
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

648
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:19,209
Scott: - Be sure to visit our website at www.frontrowcrew.com.

649
00:47:19,931 --> 00:47:22,270
Scott: If you like our podcasts, you'll love our forums.

650
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:23,206
Scott: Make sure you visit them.

651
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:27,190
Scott: You can send your email feedback to geeknights@gmail.com.

652
00:47:27,751 --> 00:47:29,851
Scott: And if you want, you can leave us a voicemail at 206-333-1537.

653
00:47:34,591 --> 00:47:37,310
Rym: GeekNights airs every weeknight, Monday through Thursday.

654
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:41,250
Scott: - GeekNights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

655
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:45,110
Scott: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
