1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,452
Scott: It's Wednesday, October 11th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:12,973 --> 00:00:14,960
Scott: Tonight we talk about CITACON!

3
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:18,518
Scott: Let's do this!

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,840
Rym: So for the first time in like a month we had a thunderstorm.

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,665
Scott: Yeah, it was kind of weird today.

6
00:00:24,705 --> 00:00:30,187
Scott: how, you know, the weather wasn't all sunny like it's been the past couple days but I didn't feel bad.

7
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:33,520
Scott: Usually when it's all gray, I'm like, uh, it's gray.

8
00:00:35,123 --> 00:00:41,318
Scott: And you get that sort of winter semi, you know, less happy than in the summer business going on.

9
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:44,937
Scott: But I was pretty happy with the bad weather today.

10
00:00:44,957 --> 00:00:45,359
Scott: I don't know.

11
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,300
Rym: See the thing is the winter around here doesn't bother me nearly as much as it did in Rochester.

12
00:00:50,364 --> 00:00:52,460
Rym: Well, because it's sunny here in the winter.

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,574
Rym: Well, there'll be a foot of snow, but it'll be sunny.

14
00:00:55,635 --> 00:00:56,580
Rym: The sun will be out.

15
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,340
Scott: Well, I mean the cold bothers me, but today it was great.

16
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,084
Rym: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

17
00:01:00,325 --> 00:01:03,220
Rym: So the cold bothers you yet you get pissed off if the sun is out.

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,740
Scott: Well, because I don't like the brightness of the sun, but I like the warmth of the sun.

19
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,678
Rym: What kind of fungus are you?

20
00:01:10,742 --> 00:01:15,980
Scott: Anyway, it was gray and dank, but I was kind of happy because it was a change of pace.

21
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:17,158
Scott: You know, I like change.

22
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:26,900
Rym: See, I like change, but when it comes to the weather, I would love it to be like 89 degrees dry and brutally sunny every single day.

23
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,635
Scott: Oh, just something about today's weather felt good.

24
00:01:29,655 --> 00:01:30,320
Scott: I don't know what it was.

25
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,080
Scott: I bet you if the same weather was tomorrow, I probably wouldn't feel good about that.

26
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,614
Rym: You know, the same weather is going to be tomorrow.

27
00:01:34,634 --> 00:01:35,139
Rym: In fact, worse.

28
00:01:35,921 --> 00:01:38,180
Rym: It's going to be rainy and miserable for the next couple days.

29
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,470
Scott: Yeah, see rain, I like, I love rain when I'm inside.

30
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,440
Scott: Rain is the best thing in the universe, and I'm outside, rain is the worst thing ever.

31
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,750
Rym: See, I like rain outside.

32
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:46,860
Rym: I like to go for walks in the rain.

33
00:01:47,421 --> 00:01:48,159
Scott: You go do that.

34
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:49,725
Rym: I have in the past.

35
00:01:49,926 --> 00:01:53,160
Rym: In fact, I remember one time you locked me and Emily out of the house when we did so.

36
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:54,965
Scott: Yeah, yeah I did.

37
00:01:55,266 --> 00:01:58,200
Scott: You wanted to be in the rain, but then, oh, you wanted to be inside.

38
00:01:58,622 --> 00:01:59,840
Scott: I thought you liked it in the rain.

39
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:02,620
Rym: I did, and you know what, it wasn't raining anymore and we were done.

40
00:02:03,163 --> 00:02:03,706
Scott: Uh-huh.

41
00:02:04,309 --> 00:02:06,120
Scott: Well, uh, yeah, you get what you deserve.

42
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,785
Rym: Anyway, we got some news.

43
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:11,340
Rym: Being Anime Manga Comics Day to all of you new Cinecon listeners.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,320
Scott: Yeah, well, we were at Cinecon this weekend, but while we were at Cinecon, there was another con going on in New Jersey called Manga Next.

45
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:26,480
Rym: Which we kind of wanted to go to, and we might have gone for a, in fact, we probably would have gone for a day if Cinecon hadn't been, you know, awesome and went there instead.

46
00:02:26,821 --> 00:02:32,480
Scott: Yeah, but, uh, Manga Next is apparently the sister, brother, companion convention to Anime Next.

47
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,840
Scott: It's in the same place, run by the same people, but it's manga instead of anime.

48
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,240
Rym: Now, I don't know what the hell that's all about.

49
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,357
Scott: I don't know, what do you do at a manga convention that's different from an anime convention?

50
00:02:43,377 --> 00:02:43,920
Rym: I don't know.

51
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,560
Rym: I mean, that's like having a video game convention and then a DDR convention.

52
00:02:48,521 --> 00:02:53,853
Scott: I mean, if it was Japan, there's enough manga where you could have a manga convention.

53
00:02:53,893 --> 00:02:57,100
Scott: that was a lot like, you know, a comic convention.

54
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,659
Rym: Well, I mean, here, most of the manga I like hasn't been released in the US.

55
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:01,840
Scott: I know, right?

56
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,300
Rym: Or has been released in such a limited quantity with no advertising that no one's ever heard of it.

57
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,620
Scott: Yeah, it's like you could have a complete manga convention for me with like one table full of manga, and that would be all of it in the US.

58
00:03:13,302 --> 00:03:18,119
Scott: But anyway, there were two industry panels at this convention where they announced some stuff.

59
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:27,020
Scott: Del Rey manga announced three new series, Kitchen Princess, Momote, Lollipop, and Shugochara.

60
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:29,800
Rym: Alright, that last one doesn't have something weird in the name.

61
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,960
Scott: Shugochara is by Peach Pit, who is the people who did Dearest and Rose and Maiden.

62
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:36,486
Rym: God.

63
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:37,316
Rym: Yeah.

64
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:37,957
Rym: God.

65
00:03:39,082 --> 00:03:42,700
Rym: Dear, don't even get me started on that goddamn manga.

66
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:57,740
Scott: In addition to the nine volumes of Genshiken that Del Rey will ultimately publish, you know, because they already published some of them here, there's going to be a Genshiken fan book, and there's going to be some Kuujibiki Unbalanced something something.

67
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,680
Rym: I like Kuujibiki Unbalanced more than I like Genshiken.

68
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:03,560
Scott: Yeah, there's going to be some Unbalanced action.

69
00:04:03,741 --> 00:04:04,659
Rym: I'm all about that.

70
00:04:05,061 --> 00:04:11,880
Scott: And also the famous Carl Horn, friend of Anime World Order and anime podcasts, you know, I think he works for Dark Horse.

71
00:04:14,141 --> 00:04:19,760
Scott: He says that Del Rey will be releasing an encyclopedia covering every manga that has been published in English.

72
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:25,460
Scott: We'll see if that's true, because, you know, a guy from Dark Horse announces something about Del Rey.

73
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,937
Scott: That's like Sony coming out of the press conference and being like, "Nintendo's coming out with this controller that you can move

74
00:04:30,998 --> 00:04:31,379
Scott: around.".

75
00:04:32,804 --> 00:04:34,060
Scott: So who knows if we can trust that.

76
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,760
Rym: But yet at the same time, you stand to gain nothing by lying about another company.

77
00:04:39,484 --> 00:04:39,690
Rym: I mean...

78
00:04:40,242 --> 00:04:42,138
Scott: All you do is stand to lose when they sue you.

79
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,216
Rym: Or worse, when they come out and say, "No, we're

80
00:04:45,256 --> 00:04:45,598
Rym: not.".

81
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:46,318
Scott: Yeah.

82
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,057
Rym: What the hell?

83
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:49,900
Scott: But if there is such a thing, I will totally buy that.

84
00:04:50,302 --> 00:04:51,180
Scott: I'll have to see it first.

85
00:04:51,261 --> 00:04:51,780
Rym: In a second.

86
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,199
Scott: Yeah, but if I saw it and it was good, I would get it.

87
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,299
Rym: I'm curious to see if, you know, my sanctuary will be in there.

88
00:04:58,022 --> 00:05:00,100
Scott: Sure, it has to be, because it was a manga published in English.

89
00:05:00,743 --> 00:05:04,719
Rym: I'm sure they'll leave something out, and some fanboy will complain about it, and that fanboy might be me.

90
00:05:06,483 --> 00:05:10,340
Scott: Oh, and the other panel at the convention that was industry was Vertical.

91
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:16,760
Scott: You might not have heard of Vertical, because they aren't a big manga publisher like, you know, Tokyo Pop and Viz and such.

92
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,300
Scott: But they do publish Osamu Tezuka's works that aren't already published by Dark Horse and Viz.

93
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:24,659
Scott: Mostly Buddha.

94
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,639
Scott: They've already published eight hardcover volumes of Buddha, which is all of it.

95
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:32,460
Scott: And they are now publishing the paperback versions, which is what I'm buying.

96
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,118
Scott: I already have three of them, out of eight.

97
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:42,460
Scott: And they are going to release, I've already preordered it, another Osamu Tezuka manga, Ode to Kirihito.

98
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,620
Scott: Which is, I guess, awesome, because it's a Tezuka manga.

99
00:05:46,961 --> 00:05:53,580
Scott: And they are also going to add to their catalog all of Keiko Takamiya's works.

100
00:05:54,223 --> 00:05:58,020
Scott: First they're going to do Two Terra, which is three volumes.

101
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,960
Scott: And then they're going to do some other stuff in the future.

102
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,519
Scott: One they mentioned was Shounenai Song of Wind and Trees.

103
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,179
Rym: Don't they call that a seminal Shounenai work?

104
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,438
Scott: Yeah, something like that.

105
00:06:10,742 --> 00:06:15,560
Scott: One that was visibly mentioned by name is the seminal Shounenai Song of Wind and Trees.

106
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:16,745
Rym: Huh.

107
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:17,607
Rym: Yeah.

108
00:06:18,263 --> 00:06:18,350
Rym: Yep.

109
00:06:19,143 --> 00:06:19,280
Scott: Yep.

110
00:06:20,724 --> 00:06:21,298
Scott: There you have it.

111
00:06:21,824 --> 00:06:23,720
Scott: One other thing, while we're talking about manga.

112
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:32,100
Scott: In two months from now, December, you can preorder it now because you preorder comics and stuff, you know, from Diamond two months in advance.

113
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:37,620
Scott: Dark Horse is putting out Gunsmith Cats Volume 1 Omnibus.

114
00:06:38,261 --> 00:06:39,120
Rym: Hot damn.

115
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:46,360
Scott: It's 460-something pages, and if you preorder it from DCBService.com, it's eight bucks.

116
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,214
Scott: If you buy it at the store, I think it might be 15, 20 bucks.

117
00:06:49,081 --> 00:06:50,439
Rym: I need a lot more Omnibuses.

118
00:06:50,962 --> 00:06:56,060
Scott: It's freaking a whole shit ton of Gunsmith Cats manga for not a lot of money.

119
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,239
Scott: So either preorder it now or in December, go to the bookstore and buy it.

120
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,860
Rym: See, I'm waiting for someone to re-release all of Urusei Atsara.

121
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,517
Rym: I mean, my friend Ken had a whole thing.

122
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,700
Scott: I would buy one volume of that, but I don't know if I'd buy all of it.

123
00:07:10,981 --> 00:07:13,800
Rym: I'd buy it all, because that show has a special place in my heart.

124
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,300
Scott: There's got to be a lot of Urusei Atsara manga.

125
00:07:17,463 --> 00:07:19,080
Rym: There is a lot of that manga.

126
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,880
Scott: There's a lot of long-running manga series, and I learned my lesson from One Piece.

127
00:07:24,741 --> 00:07:26,170
Scott: I probably don't want to buy them all.

128
00:07:26,231 --> 00:07:27,519
Scott: Just buy enough of it.

129
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:33,520
Rym: The thing is, I read a lot of the manga, and it never really got old.

130
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:38,597
Rym: It changed itself up more than Ranma, even to the point that it was usually always funny.

131
00:07:40,606 --> 00:07:41,140
Scott: You got news?

132
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,268
Rym: Yeah, I got news.

133
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:43,239
Rym: Real quick, little news.

134
00:07:43,861 --> 00:07:47,160
Rym: There's been all this talk about the trouble with the PS3 launch.

135
00:07:47,582 --> 00:07:50,480
Rym: Well, not really the launch, but the pre-launch, the pre-orders.

136
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,360
Rym: Now, they sold out immediately, and now they're all on eBay, but eBay's shutting them down, but no one cares, and they're going to come back up, whatever.

137
00:07:57,541 --> 00:08:01,240
Rym: Meanwhile, Nintendo, which says they're going to have, what, like 9 million Wiis or something stupid?

138
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,640
Scott: There's like a hajillion freaking Wiis going to be out there.

139
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,474
Scott: If you want a Wii, you're going to get one, if you've got the dinero.

140
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,857
Rym: So, the Nintendo store in New York City, in Manhattan, where Scott pre-ordered the Wii a while ago... Weeks ago.

141
00:08:13,261 --> 00:08:17,360
Rym: A while ago, yeah, has quietly started taking pre-orders again.

142
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,920
Scott: Yeah, it's like they took pre-orders from me and a whole bunch of other people, and then they stopped.

143
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:25,220
Scott: And then they started taking them again without any announcement at all.

144
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,180
Rym: Yeah, and also currently with no limit.

145
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:31,820
Rym: And they haven't said how many they're going to allow to be taken before they stop, but...

146
00:08:31,961 --> 00:08:34,715
Scott: But a guy said... A guy on the street said...

147
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:37,839
Rym: Yeah, well actually, apparently he asked the Nintendo store guy.

148
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:42,918
Scott: An employee at the Nintendo store told the guy who told the internet who told us...

149
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:51,280
Rym: So, while it's total hearsay, I don't doubt this for a second, that currently more than a thousand have already been pre-ordered to be picked up...

150
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,408
Scott: No, that's not what he said.

151
00:08:52,912 --> 00:08:53,940
Scott: That's not what he said at all.

152
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,760
Rym: What was just cut out there was me showing Scott the website and proving that I was right and he was wrong.

153
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:01,838
Scott: What do you want from me?

154
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:12,520
Rym: They have indeed sold, as of press time of that article on Kotaku, more than one thousand Wii pre-orders at the Nintendo store, and there's no stopping in sight.

155
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,328
Scott: How could they sell a thousand Wiis?

156
00:09:15,369 --> 00:09:17,840
Scott: I'm going to wait in line with a thousand people for Wiis.

157
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,180
Scott: Well, the thing is, you don't have to wait in line.

158
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,313
Scott: How many Wiis are they going to have?

159
00:09:20,354 --> 00:09:20,860
Scott: Two thousand?

160
00:09:21,282 --> 00:09:21,959
Rym: Probably more than that.

161
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,065
Scott: I wonder, here's the thing though.

162
00:09:24,225 --> 00:09:25,389
Scott: They got a thousand Wiis.

163
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,780
Scott: They better have a thousand Zelda Twilight Princesses there, or else.

164
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:30,066
Rym: You know how many?

165
00:09:30,086 --> 00:09:32,840
Rym: They're probably going to print extra of everything, because it doesn't matter.

166
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,134
Scott: I mean, they're going to need like eight thousand Wiimotes there.

167
00:09:37,435 --> 00:09:38,760
Scott: Where are they going to put all this shit?

168
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:41,004
Rym: Uh, you know what?

169
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:42,389
Rym: I'm sure they've got a contingency.

170
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,160
Rym: I'll bet they've got a giant freaking warehouse somewhere in that building.

171
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:50,200
Scott: They've got to have it somewhere in the basement or something, because goddamn, that's a lot of Wiimotes.

172
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:55,280
Rym: Yeah, see, I'm torn now, because I want to go down to the Nintendo store for what might be the crazy launch.

173
00:09:55,722 --> 00:09:58,480
Rym: But at the same time, our friend's throwing a party out in Philly.

174
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,750
Scott: Yeah, well, his party's on Saturday.

175
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,094
Scott: The Wii launch is on Sunday.

176
00:10:03,134 --> 00:10:04,800
Scott: You can show up at any time on Sunday.

177
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,199
Scott: I'm not going to go at midnight, even if Reggie's going to be there.

178
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,920
Rym: What if Reggie and Miyamoto were going to be there, and they would fellate you?

179
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,439
Scott: It would have to be something like that.

180
00:10:25,411 --> 00:10:26,710
Rym: Things of the day!

181
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,370
Scott: We're going to replace you saying things of the day.

182
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,070
Rym: With an echoey version of me saying things of the day.

183
00:10:32,271 --> 00:10:36,050
Scott: Yeah, but hopefully a recorded one, so you don't have to say it every day, and it'll sound better.

184
00:10:36,714 --> 00:10:38,149
Rym: I think it sounds fine the way it is for now.

185
00:10:38,951 --> 00:10:41,090
Rym: I'm not adding any of that stuff until season 2 anyway.

186
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,509
Scott: Yeah, we got to do something then.

187
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,130
Rym: We got a lot more important things to change than that.

188
00:10:46,051 --> 00:10:47,349
Scott: So, what kind of thing of the day you got?

189
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,010
Rym: Mine actually is a very personal thing of the day.

190
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,149
Rym: You see, being at Sitacon, no, nothing like that.

191
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,989
Rym: It's not a video of anything large that may be associated with me.

192
00:10:59,131 --> 00:11:07,070
Rym: So we were at Sitacon, and we had the video game pianist, Martin Lung, and entertainment system doing concerts there.

193
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:12,450
Rym: Scott recorded one of the songs that the video game pianist did from the audience.

194
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:20,210
Scott: On my shitty, shitty, shitty digital photo camera, which happens to have a video function just in case.

195
00:11:20,571 --> 00:11:27,830
Rym: Yep, now I was actually much further away in the booth dealing with the spotlight and the stage lights and the house lights during his concert.

196
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,509
Scott: I don't know why you were doing that.

197
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,650
Rym: Because no one else would.

198
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:31,910
Scott: So, just leave it alone.

199
00:11:33,915 --> 00:11:35,550
Scott: You couldn't hear the concert properly from that case.

200
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:40,230
Rym: Actually, I could because as soon as I set the lights, I just stood in the back like I used to at club all the time, and it was great.

201
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:40,815
Scott: Uh-huh.

202
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:46,206
Rym: It was mostly just because no one else knew what settings to put the house lights.

203
00:11:46,286 --> 00:11:47,109
Rym: at once he walked in.

204
00:11:47,672 --> 00:11:50,709
Rym: Because I just happened to be in the room when we set it up the first time.

205
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:52,327
Scott: Uh-huh.

206
00:11:52,348 --> 00:11:52,470
Scott: Anyway.

207
00:11:53,071 --> 00:11:55,357
Rym: But, this kid is amazing.

208
00:11:55,377 --> 00:11:59,970
Rym: We'll talk about him when we talk about the actual con, but here's an actual video of the concert we saw.

209
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,689
Rym: At least a tiny, tiny portion of it.

210
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,790
Scott: Yeah, a very tiny portion at the beginning.

211
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:11,190
Scott: Alright, my thing of the day, I don't know if I used this already, but I looked on our website, and it wasn't listed as the thing of the day already.

212
00:12:12,073 --> 00:12:14,110
Scott: And, so I'm gonna use it, screw everybody.

213
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,870
Scott: Even if we talked about it on the show somehow, you're gonna hear about it again.

214
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,489
Rym: Hey Scott, it's all you.

215
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,190
Scott: Yup, it is all me, whatever.

216
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:32,290
Scott: So, there's a game show in Japan, and the way the show works is they show the contestants fun video trivia things, and then they have this "Hey" button.

217
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,749
Scott: And they kinda hit the "Hey" button a bunch of times.

218
00:12:35,411 --> 00:12:38,930
Scott: If it's something they like, they give it more "Hey's" with the button.

219
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:46,610
Scott: And that's all it really is, and one of the segments they showed the contestants on the show was the voice actor of Doraemon.

220
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:51,510
Scott: And she can apparently beat Arkanoid on one credit.

221
00:12:52,770 --> 00:13:00,210
Scott: And they show you this woman, this like middle aged woman, who's a voice actor of a big blue magical cat.

222
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,350
Rym: She's a little frumpy and surly looking.

223
00:13:02,571 --> 00:13:08,310
Scott: Yeah, they show her beating all of Arkanoid on one credit.

224
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,630
Scott: And they fast forward through a bunch of boring parts.

225
00:13:10,931 --> 00:13:12,609
Scott: So you see her playing really really fast.

226
00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:15,161
Scott: And at one point her hand gets big.

227
00:13:15,644 --> 00:13:16,510
Scott: It's kinda scary.

228
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,870
Scott: But yeah, I didn't even know Arkanoid had a boss or anything.

229
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,530
Scott: Yet this lady can just freaking beat the crap out of the whole game.

230
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:28,690
Rym: Yeah, and of course the song played during the boss is in fact one of the songs that Entertainment System played at the con.

231
00:13:30,171 --> 00:13:33,490
Rym: It's also one of my favorite early video game songs.

232
00:13:33,972 --> 00:13:37,230
Scott: Yeah, it's a really recognizable video game song that everyone knows.

233
00:13:37,631 --> 00:13:41,890
Scott: But very few people, relatively speaking, recognize it from Arkanoid.

234
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:02,560
Rym: Well I was playing it shittily on the piano for pretty much the last month because it was stuck in my head.

235
00:14:03,261 --> 00:14:04,878
Rym: And Scott was always like "What fucking game is that

236
00:14:04,918 --> 00:14:05,080
Rym: from?".

237
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:05,705
Rym: And I was like "I don't

238
00:14:05,725 --> 00:14:05,947
Rym: know.".

239
00:14:05,967 --> 00:14:06,774
Rym: I heard it.

240
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,200
Rym: Because I heard an overseas remix while I was laying in bed one day and I didn't look up at what it was.

241
00:14:11,461 --> 00:14:15,396
Scott: Yeah, it's one of those songs where you could play it for someone and they go "I know that!

242
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,099
Scott: That's from that video

243
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:16,320
Scott: game!".

244
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:16,764
Scott: "What video

245
00:14:16,784 --> 00:14:16,966
Scott: game?".

246
00:14:17,472 --> 00:14:17,815
Scott: "Uhhh...".

247
00:14:19,142 --> 00:14:20,780
Scott: And then Arkanoid is the correct answer.

248
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,720
Rym: Anyway, so, Citicon 2006 at the SUNY Institute of Technology in Utica, New York.

249
00:14:29,407 --> 00:14:29,611
Scott: Mm-hmm.

250
00:14:30,461 --> 00:14:31,900
Rym: Not gonna talk a lot about the campus.

251
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:39,480
Rym: And it looks like a really nice school, but god damn is it a barren wasteland in Utica.

252
00:14:40,024 --> 00:14:41,880
Scott: Yeah, Utica is not the greatest town.

253
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:50,220
Scott: I mean, if anyone is complaining about, you know, Baltimore being bad, or Jersey sucking, or any other town sucking for conventions...

254
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,340
Rym: You can shut your pie holes.

255
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,940
Scott: Utica is perhaps the worst place to have a convention ever.

256
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,067
Rym: I mean, it seemed alright.

257
00:14:56,087 --> 00:14:57,860
Rym: You know, we show up, you know, Friday evening.

258
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,464
Rym: Now first we drive in Friday, right?

259
00:15:00,226 --> 00:15:02,292
Rym: No one is on this campus.

260
00:15:02,452 --> 00:15:05,260
Rym: I mean, not a single god damn person.

261
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,660
Scott: Well, they had a four day weekend apparently for Columbus Day, which I did not know until later.

262
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:16,440
Scott: But apparently that made most of the 2,500 students on campus leave and head for the hills.

263
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,240
Rym: Yeah, I mean, RIT, all the unhit people would leave whenever there's a break.

264
00:15:20,582 --> 00:15:23,940
Rym: And all the awesome people would stay on campus and make even more mischief than usual.

265
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,620
Scott: Unless they were forced to leave, which were on occasion.

266
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,023
Rym: Yeah, so, but whatever.

267
00:15:28,043 --> 00:15:34,540
Rym: You know, we show up and we walk in the door and there's this school store right next to the artist alley where we have all our equipment set up.

268
00:15:34,841 --> 00:15:37,880
Rym: And they sell Red Bull and balls and food and everything we thought we would need.

269
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:43,920
Rym: Turns out, they closed at 5pm on Friday and are not open on weekends.

270
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,860
Rym: Thus cutting us off from any source of nourishment.

271
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,279
Scott: We had to drive to get anything and the only place to get anything in this town was Walmart.

272
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,138
Rym: In fact, we asked around and everyone we talked to said, "You can go to the

273
00:15:57,178 --> 00:15:57,580
Rym: Walmart?".

274
00:15:58,502 --> 00:15:59,980
Rym: There's a McDonald's in the Walmart.

275
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,146
Rym: Wow.

276
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,360
Scott: Just wow.

277
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,517
Rym: Of course, the sad thing is, you know, everyone we talked to was like, "Yeah, there's nowhere to

278
00:16:05,638 --> 00:16:05,758
Rym: eat.".

279
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:11,800
Rym: But then we drive over to the hotel with the con chair and there's a million restaurants that they just were stupid and didn't tell us about.

280
00:16:12,581 --> 00:16:13,770
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what's wrong with these people.

281
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,120
Scott: Maybe they're a freshman without cars.

282
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,560
Rym: Yeah, because I mean, there's a Delmonico's and a bunch of pizza places and a couple bars.

283
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:24,880
Scott: Yeah, there was a lot of fast food over there too, but you know, there were places to eat.

284
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,880
Scott: Not many, but they were there and there were enough of them to get us through a weekend.

285
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:36,780
Rym: The only point I want to make, and we're going to do a whole show on this in the near future, is that SUNY IT is probably a great school to learn about IT and computer stuff.

286
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:45,240
Rym: But to all of you people at RIT who might complain about the tuition at RIT, you get what you fucking paid for.

287
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,485
Scott: Holy shit do you get what you paid for.

288
00:16:47,846 --> 00:16:52,740
Scott: There were things at RIT that I took for granted, like having projectors in every classroom that work.

289
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:58,120
Scott: You know, having very fast internet connections everywhere, having wireless everywhere.

290
00:16:58,303 --> 00:16:59,218
Rym: Having a tech crew.

291
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:05,540
Scott: Having a tech crew, having large classrooms that can support having lots of people in them.

292
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:12,480
Rym: Having coffee shops with subsidized coffee open on campus pretty much 24/7 and grocery stores on campus.

293
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:19,160
Scott: Having a big ass library and lots of computer labs and more than three non-residential buildings.

294
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,819
Rym: Having soda machines that don't completely run empty before Friday night at a con.

295
00:17:25,422 --> 00:17:30,480
Scott: Having cards that you can buy things with and multiple places to eat food from.

296
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,478
Scott: Having a gym that's separate from the SAU.

297
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:34,532
Scott: Anyway.

298
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,198
Scott: Yeah, you get what you pay for.

299
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,458
Rym: Yeah, so quit your bitching about RIT.

300
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,460
Scott: That's right.

301
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,662
Rym: But on to the con.

302
00:17:41,963 --> 00:17:48,080
Rym: Now, showing up at the con, I mean it was a really short drive, was a very heartening experience because we had no idea what to expect.

303
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:55,740
Rym: Cidicon had come out of the blue and asked us to come to the convention and then went so far as to offer to pay all of our expenses.

304
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:56,959
Scott: So of course we went.

305
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,211
Rym: Yeah, I mean forget MangaNext.

306
00:17:59,352 --> 00:18:00,559
Rym: We would have had to pay to get in there.

307
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,378
Rym: What kind of panel could we do?

308
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,240
Scott: Nothing.

309
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,240
Rym: Yeah, so we show up and we have no idea what to expect at all.

310
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,960
Scott: Well, I expected it to be a relatively small con.

311
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:13,320
Scott: Like if more than 300 people showed up, I would have been like jumping out of my socks surprised.

312
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,260
Rym: Yeah, but I mean in terms of like people or anything, we didn't know what was going on.

313
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,539
Scott: We had no clue, not at all.

314
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:27,000
Rym: So we walk into the, you know, the only building and there are like 15 people wearing red staff shirts standing there like they're waiting for us.

315
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,795
Scott: Yep, so we're like, "Hey, what's

316
00:18:28,896 --> 00:18:28,998
Scott: up?".

317
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,010
Rym: Yeah, and I gotta say the convention was really professionally run.

318
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:39,180
Rym: The con chair, Corbin, really had his act together and it was- Well, Andrew Corbin, but Corbin's his last name.

319
00:18:39,884 --> 00:18:41,259
Rym: I can't call him anything but Corbin.

320
00:18:41,461 --> 00:18:42,600
Scott: Me either, me either.

321
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,800
Rym: God, you know how many times I made multi-pass jokes this weekend?

322
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,418
Rym: Multi-pass.

323
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:47,360
Rym: Multi-pass.

324
00:18:49,248 --> 00:18:50,000
Rym: Hi, I'm Corbin Dallas.

325
00:18:51,221 --> 00:18:59,100
Rym: Anyway, but yeah, he ran a tight ship and his staff was pretty competent and this con was run better than some much bigger cons I've been to.

326
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:10,480
Scott: Imagine if you went to Otakon and there was the same number of staff and, you know, there was the same, everything that happens at Otakon was the same, only there were half as many people there.

327
00:19:11,021 --> 00:19:20,700
Scott: So you got, you know, you didn't have to, all the problems caused by lots of people, you wouldn't be a panel you couldn't get into, you could sit right at the front of every concert and event.

328
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,226
Scott: You know, you could get whatever you wanted in the dealer's room.

329
00:19:24,647 --> 00:19:30,480
Scott: All those problems caused by too many people in competition among con members, go away.

330
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,443
Scott: That is what Cinecon was like.

331
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:41,945
Scott: It was a convention that was run for, they could have handled, you know, the only reason I would say they couldn't have handled a thousand people is because the main auditorium couldn't hold that many people.

332
00:19:42,587 --> 00:19:48,420
Scott: So they could have handled easily three to five hundred people and there were maybe a hundred to two hundred people.

333
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:53,710
Rym: Yep, but they ran everything as though, I mean they ran a tight ship regardless of how many people were around.

334
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:58,700
Rym: They'd go to a panel room and do everything to make it happen even if one guy showed up to it.

335
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,805
Scott: Yep, I mean we were lazier than they were.

336
00:20:02,246 --> 00:20:08,699
Scott: By Sunday we had given up and we went to our panel room and said, "If you're here for our panels, go to Artist Alley, that's where we

337
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:08,880
Scott: are.".

338
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,500
Rym: Granted, Sunday was a pretty dead day, understandably.

339
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,466
Scott: It was a very dead day.

340
00:20:13,486 --> 00:20:16,680
Scott: They really should have made it a one day con, really.

341
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:21,675
Rym: Yeah, or what I would have done is I would have made it a Friday night through Sunday morning con.

342
00:20:21,695 --> 00:20:23,420
Rym: Like it stops at 4am on Sunday.

343
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:37,580
Scott: Yeah, going all day Sunday was, I mean, sure it made up for not going all day Friday and only doing Friday night, but really Sunday afternoon, there's a reason cons end in the middle of the day on Sunday, even really big ones.

344
00:20:38,042 --> 00:20:41,056
Scott: It's because no one hangs around late on Sunday.

345
00:20:41,076 --> 00:20:41,779
Scott: They have to go home.

346
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:55,280
Rym: So also, aside, another aside, not really related to the con, but for probably the first time in a long time, other than maybe KatsuCon where I do this, we had a hotel room that was just me and Scott and there were two beds in it.

347
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,094
Rym: We didn't have the whole entourage of the front row crew with us.

348
00:20:58,134 --> 00:20:59,059
Rym: We had a private room.

349
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:08,638
Scott: Now usually our plan ever since the college days was to cram as many people as we could into as few hotel rooms as we could comfortably sleep.

350
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:09,820
Scott: to save money.

351
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:15,831
Scott: You know, if a hotel room is $100 a night and it's one person in it, that's like $300 for one guy.

352
00:21:16,412 --> 00:21:20,399
Scott: If there's 10 people in it, well, that's $30 per person.

353
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:20,840
Scott: Awesome.

354
00:21:21,161 --> 00:21:28,800
Rym: I mean, the way we run Otakon, it typically costs $100 per person to stay in the rooms with us from Thursday until Sunday.

355
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:36,008
Rym: Yet, having a room to yourself is something that is worth all of the money.

356
00:21:36,148 --> 00:21:40,354
Rym: And I think at Otakon next year, we are going to get four rooms.

357
00:21:40,794 --> 00:21:45,000
Rym: One of those rooms is just going to be like me and Scott and maybe one or two other people at most.

358
00:21:45,362 --> 00:21:47,620
Rym: And then we're going to cram everyone else into the other three rooms.

359
00:21:48,241 --> 00:22:02,320
Scott: It was definitely awesome to have an entire bed to myself, be able to throw my shit everywhere without worrying about it getting mixed up with anyone else's shit and not having to wait for the shower or having to worry about other people delaying my con doings.

360
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:16,280
Rym: Yeah, I mean at Otakon, I mean, it sucks, but I have to wake up two hours before I want to get up, take a shower, and then coordinate everyone else showering in some sort of optimal manner or the room goes to shit and no one gets to the con.

361
00:22:16,748 --> 00:22:16,920
Rym: Yeah.

362
00:22:17,183 --> 00:22:19,000
Rym: At this con, I woke up and I got right in the shower.

363
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:27,959
Scott: If we had our own room at Otakon or any other convention, we could get up, shower, and leave, and leave everyone else with their own devices and be like, "Screw you

364
00:22:27,999 --> 00:22:28,300
Scott: guys.".

365
00:22:28,564 --> 00:22:28,712
Scott: Yeah.

366
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,410
Scott: Because everyone would have keys to those rooms and whatever.

367
00:22:32,711 --> 00:22:34,960
Scott: We got our own room, we got our own keys, we don't need you.

368
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:41,940
Rym: So before we continue, we set up in the artist alley with a pirate flag and a bunch of apples and all our stuff and our flyers and everything.

369
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,219
Scott: And we brought all this equipment there.

370
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,964
Rym: That we didn't use, though we could have.

371
00:22:46,145 --> 00:22:52,200
Rym: I mean, entertainment system wanted to be interviewed, the video game pianist wanted to be interviewed, pretty much a lot of people wanted to be interviewed.

372
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,673
Rym: We just didn't really feel like doing it at the con.

373
00:22:55,733 --> 00:22:57,340
Rym: It really, it would have gotten in the way of the fun.

374
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:07,440
Scott: Yeah, like the Night Shift guys did a 20, 30 minute podcast at the con and I listened to it and it was good, but no one else really felt like doing any podcasting.

375
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:17,560
Scott: I mean, Happy House of Hentai podcasted all their panels, you know, and it's relatively easy for them because they're way low tech and low effort in their podcast.

376
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,600
Rym: Luckily they make up for it with funniness.

377
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,865
Scott: They make up for it with funniness and spades.

378
00:23:21,945 --> 00:23:27,058
Scott: I was sketchy, I was like, "Happy House of Hentai, those sound like they're going to be scary

379
00:23:27,098 --> 00:23:27,660
Scott: perverts.".

380
00:23:27,881 --> 00:23:29,059
Rym: And they ended up being awesome.

381
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,401
Scott: They ended up being awesome.

382
00:23:30,622 --> 00:23:31,763
Scott: All the guests were awesome.

383
00:23:32,243 --> 00:23:47,600
Scott: Basically at this con, sure there were some awesome con attendees, but most of the con for us was a bunch of awesome guests and some awesome staff hanging out, being awesome together, while all occasional people milled about around us.

384
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:54,280
Rym: Yep, I mean one of the panels we got dragged into doing, and it was just us and Corbin, was basically Your Favorite Anime Sucks.

385
00:23:54,802 --> 00:23:59,159
Scott: He kind of dragged us into it and we were kind of like, "Eh, whatever, alright, we got nothing better to

386
00:23:59,199 --> 00:23:59,320
Scott: do.".

387
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,100
Rym: And we did Late Late Night on Saturday.

388
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,700
Scott: And he liked doing it so much, he made us do it again the next day.

389
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:11,360
Rym: And the thing is, the people who were there liked it so much that they all came back to see it again in the morning.

390
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,660
Scott: Yeah, and then we remembered to actually tell them to listen to GeekNights.

391
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,400
Rym: Yeah, because we totally didn't plug ourselves, we just did stuff at the con.

392
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:25,160
Rym: But yeah, I mean, the panels we ran, like the podcast using Nightpannel or the Your Favorite Anime Sucks panel.

393
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,459
Scott: We didn't record any of these panels.

394
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:33,720
Rym: But they were awesome, because it was basically just us hanging out in front of the room and people listening to us and being entertained.

395
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:41,780
Scott: Yeah, so from now on, if you guys out there listening to the show, you're not going to have the luxury of hearing all our con panels podcasting anymore.

396
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,410
Scott: We're not going to podcast all of them.

397
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,040
Scott: In fact, we're not going to podcast most of them.

398
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,440
Scott: So you're going to have to come to cons to hear us now, or you're missing out on something.

399
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,240
Rym: Yeah, though we did record the Podcasters Unite panel.

400
00:24:53,081 --> 00:24:57,240
Rym: I'm trying to clean it up, because for various reasons it couldn't be recorded very well.

401
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,700
Rym: Because all the other podcasters want it, but I'm not going to bother with trying to plan it on our show.

402
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,266
Scott: No, we're not going to plan it on our show.

403
00:25:03,286 --> 00:25:06,440
Scott: You're going to have to listen to one of the other podcasters who was at the con.

404
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,579
Scott: They might put it up if they think it's okay with them.

405
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:14,240
Rym: So I guess before we continue, the guests we hung out with at the con were all awesome.

406
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:15,600
Scott: Everyone was awesome.

407
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:21,040
Rym: We had, of course, Dave and Joel from one of my favorite new podcasts, Fast Karate for the Gentlemen.

408
00:25:21,761 --> 00:25:27,940
Scott: Dave and Joel, Fast Karate for the Gentlemen is two guys who are hilarious talking about, I guess, anime.

409
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,030
Scott: And making lots of awesome, hilarious jokes.

410
00:25:31,511 --> 00:25:33,760
Scott: You know our joke about you can't attend Pokemon.

411
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,977
Rym: You can't attend Pokemon.

412
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,520
Scott: It's kind of like that styling, which is why it's so awesome.

413
00:25:38,682 --> 00:25:40,520
Rym: Yeah, their style of humor is infectious.

414
00:25:41,121 --> 00:25:45,460
Rym: And also, we ran an anime match game, which went over really, really well.

415
00:25:45,721 --> 00:25:47,679
Rym: We're going to try to do this at Otakana Katsukan now.

416
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,380
Rym: But they were panelists, and good God are those guys hilarious.

417
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,000
Rym: I want them to be celebrity panelists any time I ever run that game show forever.

418
00:25:58,043 --> 00:25:58,428
Scott: I agree.

419
00:25:59,238 --> 00:25:59,420
Rym: Okay.

420
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,416
Rym: Yeah, we also had half of the Ninja Consultants.

421
00:26:02,516 --> 00:26:03,080
Rym: Noah was there.

422
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,079
Scott: Yeah, Noah is the male half of the Ninja Consultants.

423
00:26:06,461 --> 00:26:11,160
Scott: And, you know, I'd met him before and hung out with him a little bit, but never for real, like this time.

424
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,319
Scott: And he's actually way more awesome in person than he is on his podcast.

425
00:26:15,863 --> 00:26:17,578
Scott: Not that his podcast is bad, but...

426
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,619
Rym: Just that he's a cool dude.

427
00:26:18,962 --> 00:26:19,880
Scott: He's pretty damn cool.

428
00:26:20,702 --> 00:26:22,320
Rym: Also, we had a Weekly Anime Review.

429
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:29,060
Scott: Weekly Anime Review is a podcast I listened to once when they interviewed Corbin, the con cherub zinacon.

430
00:26:29,701 --> 00:26:34,180
Scott: And I knew about it, but I never listened to it because I didn't really have a need for a Weekly Anime Review.

431
00:26:35,342 --> 00:26:37,619
Scott: But Aaron and Diana were actually pretty cool.

432
00:26:38,822 --> 00:26:40,879
Scott: It was like, I didn't know what to expect from them.

433
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,700
Scott: You know, I figured a kind of laid back, normal anime watching guy.

434
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,035
Scott: Which he kind of was, but he wasn't a loser.

435
00:26:48,055 --> 00:26:48,960
Scott: He was awesome.

436
00:26:50,421 --> 00:26:53,020
Rym: I love how... You never give anyone a compliment.

437
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,575
Rym: The best you'll say about someone is usually, "They weren't

438
00:26:55,837 --> 00:26:56,058
Rym: shit.".

439
00:26:56,467 --> 00:26:56,740
Scott: Yeah.

440
00:26:58,022 --> 00:26:58,779
Scott: No, they were way cool.

441
00:26:59,904 --> 00:27:04,540
Scott: I think they were like the only... them, Noah, and Corbin were the only people who didn't smoke.

442
00:27:05,421 --> 00:27:07,940
Rym: Yeah, and they were also the only ones who actually watch a lot of it.

443
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,160
Scott: Martin Long didn't smoke either.

444
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,229
Rym: Yeah, of course.

445
00:27:10,249 --> 00:27:11,380
Rym: We'll get to the little smoking thing.

446
00:27:12,041 --> 00:27:18,020
Rym: And of course, Lord K and Hello Kitty from Happy House of Hentai were hilarious and awesome.

447
00:27:18,582 --> 00:27:20,000
Scott: Even if you're not a pervert.

448
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,119
Scott: If you don't like hentai, like us, we don't like hentai.

449
00:27:23,481 --> 00:27:25,720
Scott: We think it's perverted and kind of sick.

450
00:27:25,881 --> 00:27:29,338
Scott: And if you tell us you watch hentai, we'll kind of be like, "Okay,

451
00:27:29,378 --> 00:27:29,640
Scott: dude.".

452
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,760
Rym: Granted, I've watched some hentai and it's usually hilarious.

453
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,940
Scott: These people, they don't concentrate on the perverted part of hentai.

454
00:27:37,181 --> 00:27:39,620
Scott: They concentrate on the hilarious part of hentai.

455
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:47,120
Rym: Yeah, I mean, they did a panel and at one point, all they did was describe straight up the plot of a hentai.

456
00:27:48,021 --> 00:27:52,396
Rym: And listening to that being described, especially by them and the way they did it, was just...

457
00:27:54,361 --> 00:27:57,340
Scott: It's comedy gold and they've podcasted all those things.

458
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,080
Scott: So if you go to Happy House of Hentai, you should be able to listen to that stuff pretty soon, if not already.

459
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:09,200
Rym: Yep, and of course, last and certainly not least, we had the Night Shift podcast, who I hadn't heard of or anything until this con.

460
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,260
Scott: Well, I heard of the Night Shift podcast from the Citicon website when they announced them as guests.

461
00:28:13,601 --> 00:28:19,080
Scott: So I went and I checked out one of their episodes and they talked about cheap beer, one of which was steel reserve.

462
00:28:19,683 --> 00:28:21,390
Scott: And I was like, "Okay, whatever.

463
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,197
Scott: I wonder what those guys will be

464
00:28:23,258 --> 00:28:23,479
Scott: like.".

465
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,889
Scott: But they were actually awesome guys.

466
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:28,160
Scott: We talked a whole lot with them about all kinds of stuff.

467
00:28:28,702 --> 00:28:31,880
Scott: And they brought a computer and they were running all the main games on it.

468
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,938
Rym: Man, we spent so much of Sunday playing absolutely shitty old fighting games with each other.

469
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:37,380
Rym: It was great.

470
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:42,280
Scott: Yeah, they brought this main cabinet and everyone was hanging around playing games on it all the time.

471
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,560
Scott: They were definitely wicked smart.

472
00:28:44,401 --> 00:28:46,930
Scott: And their podcast, I listened to some other episodes.

473
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:49,720
Scott: It was much better than their beer episode.

474
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,420
Rym: Well, it actually came up in the Podcast Using Night panel.

475
00:28:52,780 --> 00:29:04,198
Rym: Every podcaster out there, especially the people who are weekly or monthly instead of daily like us, everyone always worries about, "What if I get a new listener and they listen to the one shit episode out of the hundred good

476
00:29:04,339 --> 00:29:04,499
Rym: ones?".

477
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,724
Rym: Yeah, exactly.

478
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:09,740
Scott: These guys, I think they do twice weekly is the rate of doing their show.

479
00:29:10,121 --> 00:29:13,899
Scott: And it's pretty short and it's mostly, you know, hilariousness.

480
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,001
Rym: Yep.

481
00:29:15,061 --> 00:29:18,100
Rym: Now, of course, the other two guests, Entertainment System.

482
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:23,540
Rym: If you've never heard of them, we've talked about them before, they are a Nintendo metal band.

483
00:29:24,442 --> 00:29:28,560
Scott: Yeah, we met Entertainment System at Otakon two years ago.

484
00:29:28,781 --> 00:29:29,107
Rym: I think so.

485
00:29:29,147 --> 00:29:29,840
Rym: They did a concert.

486
00:29:30,341 --> 00:29:35,700
Scott: They performed at Otakon to a middling crowd, which we were prominent members.

487
00:29:35,921 --> 00:29:39,440
Rym: To say prominent, all right, first off, we're yelling and screaming.

488
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:45,260
Rym: And then we started a mosh pit, which was broken up by Otakon staff within eight seconds.

489
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:53,200
Scott: Yeah, these guys, they got a rhythm guitarist who's the lead guy, two lead guitars, a bassist and a drummer.

490
00:29:53,320 --> 00:30:00,140
Scott: And they freaking just, they have, they're not actually just, you know, playing Nintendo songs on rock instruments.

491
00:30:00,542 --> 00:30:03,500
Scott: They actually have composed, you know, pieces of music.

492
00:30:03,981 --> 00:30:14,080
Scott: Yeah, arranged pieces of music based on old Nintendo songs, you know, and what their new songs like Mega Man three for three, which is three Mega Man, three songs combined into one.

493
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,480
Rym: And their 007 song is really hard and great.

494
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,000
Scott: Yeah, their Goldeneye, you know, from the frigate stage is actually really, really good.

495
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:25,455
Scott: Like I didn't, I was like, I've heard rock James Bonds before.

496
00:30:25,515 --> 00:30:26,560
Scott: How good is yours going to be?

497
00:30:26,841 --> 00:30:28,049
Scott: Oh, it's real good.

498
00:30:28,069 --> 00:30:28,855
Scott: Oh, yeah.

499
00:30:30,341 --> 00:30:40,760
Rym: But at Otakon, we made such a stink at their, at their show that later on we were going to see, I think we talked about this on the show before, but briefly we were going to see a show like a violent movie.

500
00:30:41,342 --> 00:30:46,040
Rym: and they come up and they point us, they're like, it's those guys, those guys are awesome.

501
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,420
Scott: And we said, it's those guys, those guys are awesome.

502
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,200
Rym: And it's two groups of guys who were being fannish at each other and it was hilarious.

503
00:30:53,044 --> 00:30:56,440
Scott: And then we saw, we saw them at a Citicon.

504
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,251
Scott: They actually showed up to do their shows and everything.

505
00:30:59,271 --> 00:31:01,280
Scott: And you know, we rocked out.

506
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,006
Scott: They did two concerts, actually one in sort of an open room, and then one right before.

507
00:31:06,026 --> 00:31:09,160
Scott: the video game pianist did his thing after and after the cosplay.

508
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,960
Rym: So of course we know here's the difference between Otakon and Citicon.

509
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,008
Rym: At Otakon, the staff broke up our mosh pit.

510
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:18,940
Rym: At Citicon, the staff started their own mosh pit.

511
00:31:19,262 --> 00:31:22,117
Scott: Yeah, we were just rocking out with the staff at the first concert.

512
00:31:22,137 --> 00:31:22,780
Scott: It was way cool.

513
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:26,380
Scott: And then we went out to him after and he's like, yeah, I remember you guys from Otakon.

514
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,340
Rym: And they gave us free t-shirts.

515
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,440
Scott: They gave us t-shirts because we rocked out the most, more than anyone else at their concert.

516
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:40,060
Rym: So if you at all like video game music or metal, I highly suggest you check out Entertainment System.

517
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,420
Scott: Myspace.com/entertainment-system.

518
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,609
Rym: They got some CDs out.

519
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:45,200
Rym: Apparently they sell out constantly.

520
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,746
Scott: Yeah, the CD is constantly sold out.

521
00:31:46,786 --> 00:31:53,758
Scott: They're gonna do a big show in State College, Pennsylvania, which is where Penn State is, and that's October 28th.

522
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,270
Scott: So if you're gonna go, if you're anywhere near Penn State, State College, Pennsylvania, go there and see the show.

523
00:32:00,693 --> 00:32:01,720
Scott: It's gonna be their biggest show.

524
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,240
Scott: And then they're going to the West Coast apparently.

525
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,620
Rym: Yeah, and hopefully I'd love to see him play out here.

526
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,900
Rym: I'm gonna see if I can get him into RIT or something for some big gig somewhere.

527
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:10,980
Scott: That would be pretty awesome.

528
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,360
Rym: Yeah, I mean, a band like that at RIT would just go crazy.

529
00:32:15,627 --> 00:32:16,339
Scott: They would indeed.

530
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:24,278
Rym: Yep, and in addition to them, we had Martin Leung, I hope I'm pronouncing his last name wrong, the video game pianist.

531
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,006
Scott: You might remember this guy.

532
00:32:26,046 --> 00:32:33,040
Scott: He was famous on YouTube and E-Bombs World and everything because he played Mario blindfolded and backwards and everything like that.

533
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:47,879
Rym: Yeah, in addition to being a classically trained, damn fine pianist, I mean, to put it in perspective, he is, and not to knock piano squall at all, but he is as better than piano squall as piano squall is better than me.

534
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,140
Rym: This kid is amazing.

535
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,460
Rym: He is freaking amazing.

536
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,179
Rym: Because I'm a shit piano player.

537
00:32:52,782 --> 00:32:55,600
Scott: And I'm not a piano player at all.

538
00:32:56,581 --> 00:33:00,980
Scott: I mean, I guess I'm better than absolute zero, but it's like one degree.

539
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:07,120
Rym: So, you know, he's famous on the internets now and he plays all these big things and they flew him out to Sitacon to play a concert.

540
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,072
Scott: And he's not lying about his skills.

541
00:33:10,253 --> 00:33:11,780
Scott: Let's just put it that way.

542
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:14,720
Rym: Yeah, if anything, this kid is way too humble.

543
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:18,819
Rym: He deserves to have a little bit more ego about how cool he is.

544
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,517
Scott: Not like us, where we're like, "Oh, we're so awesome and we're only mostly

545
00:33:22,657 --> 00:33:22,939
Scott: awesome.".

546
00:33:23,181 --> 00:33:24,636
Rym: Yeah, we're like, "We're so awesome, blah, blah,

547
00:33:24,657 --> 00:33:24,960
Rym: blah.".

548
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,450
Rym: And he's like, "Eh, I just do what I do.

549
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,875
Rym: I'm an okay student at my

550
00:33:28,956 --> 00:33:29,257
Rym: school.".

551
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,719
Scott: You know what I mean?

552
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:34,420
Scott: He said there were 40 other students studying classical piano at his school.

553
00:33:34,981 --> 00:33:36,351
Scott: And I was like, "Well, are you better than them?

554
00:33:36,412 --> 00:33:36,996
Scott: Are they better than

555
00:33:37,036 --> 00:33:37,177
Scott: you?".

556
00:33:37,661 --> 00:33:39,599
Scott: Apparently he's been playing piano since he was four.

557
00:33:41,022 --> 00:33:43,680
Scott: And he just, you know, he wouldn't say anything so great.

558
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,577
Scott: We're like, "Oh, we're so

559
00:33:44,597 --> 00:33:44,700
Scott: old.".

560
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:46,512
Scott: 'Cause we asked him how old he was.

561
00:33:46,533 --> 00:33:47,281
Scott: He said 19.

562
00:33:47,281 --> 00:33:48,292
Scott: And all of us were like, "Aw,

563
00:33:48,494 --> 00:33:48,757
Scott: shit.".

564
00:33:49,642 --> 00:33:50,779
Rym: 'Cause we were all in the mid-20s.

565
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,353
Scott: He's gonna be 20 real soon, though.

566
00:33:52,514 --> 00:33:53,380
Scott: He's almost 20.

567
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:53,960
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

568
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,797
Scott: But the point is, he's like, "Oh, you guys aren't so

569
00:33:56,918 --> 00:33:57,059
Scott: old.".

570
00:33:57,261 --> 00:33:57,868
Scott: We're like, "Shut up,

571
00:33:57,909 --> 00:33:58,010
Scott: you.".

572
00:33:58,901 --> 00:34:00,933
Rym: So, he put on a great concert.

573
00:34:00,953 --> 00:34:02,200
Rym: I mean, the crowd loved it.

574
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,900
Rym: And there was a pretty big crowd for this concert.

575
00:34:04,145 --> 00:34:04,337
Rym: Yeah.

576
00:34:04,481 --> 00:34:05,540
Rym: It was after the cosplay.

577
00:34:06,141 --> 00:34:06,985
Scott: After the cosplay.

578
00:34:07,106 --> 00:34:10,000
Scott: It was cosplay, entertainment system, Martin Long.

579
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:10,540
Rym: Yep.

580
00:34:10,641 --> 00:34:15,252
Rym: And then, after that, of course, us and the con chair, and what was the other guy's name?

581
00:34:15,293 --> 00:34:15,880
Rym: The other staffer.

582
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,768
Rym: Uh... Oh, I'm sorry, dude.

583
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:19,958
Rym: We forgot your name, but you were cool.

584
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:30,498
Rym: So, us, the con chair, Corbin, this other cool guy, and the video game pianist, went out to Delmonico's to get some steak for dinner 'cause we hadn't eaten anything of note all day.

585
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:32,600
Scott: Yeah, and that was a good time, eating dinner.

586
00:34:32,982 --> 00:34:37,380
Rym: Yeah, of course, the con could barely function without Corbin there to run everything.

587
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:38,185
Scott: That was fine.

588
00:34:38,225 --> 00:34:39,659
Scott: Nothing much was going on at that time.

589
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:40,446
Rym: Yeah.

590
00:34:41,822 --> 00:34:43,900
Rym: So, they had a cosplay in addition to all this.

591
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,146
Scott: All right, the cosplay.

592
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,080
Scott: We're going backwards in time to the cosplay.

593
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,989
Rym: Yeah, every con has a cosplay.

594
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:52,760
Rym: Every con that's good has a cosplay, despite what Anime World Order would say about cosplay.

595
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:53,587
Scott: Uh-huh.

596
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:58,660
Rym: And I gotta say, the people who entered the cosplay were pretty high quality.

597
00:34:58,941 --> 00:35:02,750
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I expected it just to be like a bunch of kids going, but it wasn't.

598
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:03,820
Scott: It was actually kinda okay.

599
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:09,940
Rym: Yeah, no offense to my old alma mater, but they had better, well, at least more people at their cosplay than Tarkon had.

600
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:16,039
Scott: Yeah, I must say, though, there weren't any super amazing skits, but what can you expect?

601
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:25,240
Rym: Yeah, though, of note, I mean, 'cause actually, it was funny, Corbin walks by Scott at some point during Saturday, 'cause the cosplay's Saturday night, and he basically says-- It was early Saturday.

602
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:28,980
Rym: Yeah, and he's like, "So, uh, you can run the cos--".

603
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,474
Rym: You're like, "You're set for the cosplay, right?

604
00:35:30,534 --> 00:35:31,019
Rym: You're gonna run

605
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:31,119
Rym: it?".

606
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:32,099
Rym: And then he kinda ran away.

607
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,020
Scott: He's like, "Yeah, we're doing this cosplay.

608
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,474
Scott: You guys wanna do something for it?

609
00:35:35,514 --> 00:35:35,898
Scott: Help us

610
00:35:36,019 --> 00:35:36,080
Scott: out?".

611
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,017
Scott: I'm like, "Well, what do you want me to

612
00:35:37,037 --> 00:35:37,078
Scott: do?".

613
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,397
Scott: And he's like, "Here's what we got so

614
00:35:38,437 --> 00:35:38,599
Scott: far.".

615
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,555
Scott: And he shows me the page in the con book that has the cosplay rules, and then he leaves, and I'm like, "Uh,

616
00:35:43,636 --> 00:35:43,838
Scott: dude.".

617
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,714
Rym: So Scott comes over to me like, "I think we're running the

618
00:35:46,775 --> 00:35:47,539
Rym: cosplay.".

619
00:35:48,306 --> 00:35:49,137
Scott: And I was like, "All

620
00:35:49,157 --> 00:35:49,360
Scott: right.".

621
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:56,020
Rym: All I can picture is the sound from Anime World Order when Daryl Surratt ran that cosplay.

622
00:35:57,042 --> 00:35:58,000
Scott: Oh, that was great.

623
00:35:58,505 --> 00:35:59,360
Scott: And the truth died.

624
00:36:01,103 --> 00:36:04,574
Scott: So I called Corbin eventually, and I was like, "All right, what exactly do you want us to do for the

625
00:36:04,594 --> 00:36:05,160
Scott: cosplay?".

626
00:36:05,261 --> 00:36:07,500
Scott: And in the end, we ended up just judging it.

627
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:14,980
Scott: It was fine, because the part that I didn't want to handle was lining the people up and figuring out who goes on when and who's who and all that jazz.

628
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,360
Rym: Yeah, but again, props to Citicon for having the staff.

629
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,099
Rym: Everything was totally organized and set up.

630
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,020
Scott: Yeah, I was kind of amazed.

631
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:26,540
Scott: Usually a cosplay will start, like, way after the, you know, allotted time.

632
00:36:26,882 --> 00:36:31,639
Scott: Their cosplay started ten minutes after they said it was gonna start, which is basically on time.

633
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,279
Rym: Yeah, especially considering the sheer number of people in the cosplay compared to the size of the con.

634
00:36:37,262 --> 00:36:46,777
Scott: Yeah, like, the whole front two rows of the auditorium were filled with cosplayers once they were all done, and about slightly more than that number of people were in the audience.

635
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:53,560
Rym: Yep, now, on the cosplay panel, we had a bunch of people, like staffers, and the guys from, what, Caffeinated Press?

636
00:36:53,842 --> 00:36:57,740
Scott: There was one guy from Caffeinated Press, one staffer, and both of us were the judges.

637
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,840
Rym: Yep, and luckily, I've judged cosplays before.

638
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,459
Rym: In fact, I learned a lot about cosplays from text back at RIT.

639
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,340
Rym: So we were okay to handle this, because Scott, we've talked about cosplays before.

640
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:08,957
Rym: We know what to do.

641
00:37:09,701 --> 00:37:15,540
Rym: And we both kind of filled in everyone else, like, here's how you actually judge a cosplay versus what everyone thinks a cosplay is judged by.

642
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,120
Scott: Yeah, but screw that cosplay.com buy-the-book stuff, you know.

643
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:19,699
Scott: See, here's the thing.

644
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:23,279
Rym: I like that kind of cosplay, but I like the free form, too.

645
00:37:23,521 --> 00:37:28,520
Rym: Basically, as long as everyone involved in a cosplay knows exactly what to expect, I'm okay with it.

646
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,519
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

647
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:34,080
Scott: So all we had to really do was, you know, every cosplayer had a number.

648
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,200
Scott: We had to take their number and assign the numbers to the awards.

649
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:48,420
Rym: Now, of course, this isn't really Corbin or anyone's fault, but they didn't really... I don't think they knew how cosplay judges need to do their thing.

650
00:37:49,221 --> 00:38:07,079
Rym: As in, he didn't set it up so we could look at the costumes like one-on-one with the people or interview them backstage, which, honestly, the reason I don't fault him is because when I ran that cosplay at RIT when I was president right before I left RIT, you know, that spring cosplay, I totally didn't do that for my judges and Tex yelled at me.

651
00:38:07,864 --> 00:38:09,139
Rym: So that's why I knew to do that.

652
00:38:10,301 --> 00:38:14,111
Rym: And the other thing was, you know, judges like to interview like, "So, did you make that yourself?

653
00:38:14,172 --> 00:38:14,878
Rym: What fabric did you

654
00:38:14,939 --> 00:38:15,040
Rym: use?".

655
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:15,599
Rym: All that stuff.

656
00:38:16,223 --> 00:38:18,300
Rym: He wanted us to do that in front of the crowd.

657
00:38:18,521 --> 00:38:19,739
Scott: Which is really kind of eh.

658
00:38:20,222 --> 00:38:29,580
Rym: Well, it was fine, except that after the first three people, I didn't want to ask the fourth person a question and none of you fuckers decided to ask a question.

659
00:38:29,801 --> 00:38:30,717
Scott: Well, there wasn't much to ask.

660
00:38:32,622 --> 00:38:36,496
Scott: Some costumes have something to ask like, "How do you get those wings to stay

661
00:38:36,618 --> 00:38:36,699
Scott: up?".

662
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,697
Scott: or "What's that weapon made out

663
00:38:38,819 --> 00:38:38,859
Scott: of?".

664
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,076
Scott: or "How long did it take to make that really

665
00:38:41,137 --> 00:38:41,520
Scott: intricate?".

666
00:38:41,661 --> 00:38:44,418
Scott: or "Is that sewed on or is that painted

667
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:44,679
Scott: on?".

668
00:38:44,801 --> 00:38:45,698
Scott: You know, that sort of stuff.

669
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,839
Rym: Though Scott asked probably the best question in this one group.

670
00:38:49,887 --> 00:38:50,559
Scott: What question was that?

671
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,100
Scott: The magic.

672
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:57,879
Scott: Okay, so this group gets up and there are these people, I think they were like evil guys from Kingdom Hearts or something like that.

673
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:03,360
Scott: And they do this magic trick, which I saw, which is so transparent.

674
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,620
Rym: But the thing is, their stage presence was really good.

675
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:12,980
Scott: Their stage presence was really good and they were pretty cool, you know, in their costumes were above average and everything.

676
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,698
Scott: And I was like, "Can I come up there and do the magic

677
00:39:15,738 --> 00:39:15,939
Scott: trick?".

678
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:18,077
Scott: You know, I was like, "Yeah, I'll come and do

679
00:39:18,137 --> 00:39:18,177
Scott: it.".

680
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:19,452
Scott: And then they were like, "Uh...".

681
00:39:20,241 --> 00:39:22,997
Scott: When they realized that I had figured it out, they were like, "Uh, no,

682
00:39:23,198 --> 00:39:23,359
Scott: no.".

683
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:29,740
Rym: But they handled it in character because they were kind of these evil, think like a Gestapo kind of thing, like the aura they were putting on.

684
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,100
Scott: We got to play Kingdom Hearts so we know what the hell these people are talking about.

685
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,900
Rym: Yeah, I really want to play Kingdom Hearts.

686
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,097
Rym: But they pulled off this very, "There will be no more magic

687
00:39:37,137 --> 00:39:37,419
Rym: tricks!".

688
00:39:37,849 --> 00:39:38,080
Scott: Yeah.

689
00:39:38,707 --> 00:39:39,254
Rym: "This showing is

690
00:39:39,396 --> 00:39:39,578
Rym: over!".

691
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:43,400
Rym: And they handled it so well that we all voted for them for best presentation.

692
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:52,460
Scott: Yeah, and the thing was after the cosplay, after people were done doing whatever they were doing on stage, they sat down in the front rows to watch the rest of the cosplay.

693
00:39:53,380 --> 00:40:00,779
Scott: And after those people sat down, the female, who was sort of the lead of their group, was yelling like the greatest shit at all the other cosplayers.

694
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,480
Rym: Like the kind of stuff we always yell.

695
00:40:02,902 --> 00:40:04,680
Scott: Yeah, so I thought they were way cool.

696
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:05,903
Rym: Yep.

697
00:40:05,964 --> 00:40:13,600
Rym: Also of note, there were three girls from Quebec who came to this con and cosplayed as very well-done Shinsengumi.

698
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,660
Scott: Yeah, it was kind of crazy.

699
00:40:15,321 --> 00:40:17,559
Scott: Wow, you came from Quebec to Sitakan.

700
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:22,100
Rym: Yeah, but it was really cool because we met him and they had really interesting accents.

701
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,674
Rym: And I thought like, "Wow, they're speaking French?

702
00:40:24,754 --> 00:40:25,479
Rym: I wonder if they're...".

703
00:40:25,801 --> 00:40:27,999
Rym: And then I talked to him and one of them didn't speak English at all.

704
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,040
Rym: And then I figured out they were Quebecois.

705
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:34,200
Rym: And haltingly in French, I talked to him a little bit and it was barely enough.

706
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,979
Rym: But luckily two of them spoke English really well.

707
00:40:36,303 --> 00:40:36,420
Rym: Yep.

708
00:40:36,761 --> 00:40:37,659
Rym: But they were really cool.

709
00:40:38,101 --> 00:40:40,280
Rym: And then they won an award too for craftsmanship, I believe.

710
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:44,240
Scott: Yeah, because we gave the person who had the best craftsmanship best in show.

711
00:40:44,403 --> 00:40:52,720
Scott: so we get, you know... Normally we would have given... If we would have allowed ourselves to give more than one award to one person, one person would have gotten like four awards.

712
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,640
Rym: Yeah, there was this one girl and she was absolutely adorable.

713
00:40:56,801 --> 00:40:59,440
Rym: And I mean that in an entirely innocent way.

714
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,030
Rym: Yeah.

715
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:05,460
Rym: She was just really cute and she had this costume and it was just absolutely adorable.

716
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:06,819
Scott: Oh, God.

717
00:41:07,484 --> 00:41:08,192
Rym: What was it from?

718
00:41:08,212 --> 00:41:08,880
Rym: I don't even remember.

719
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,599
Scott: I think it was just some thing.

720
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,940
Rym: She had a reference picture, but I didn't look at that.

721
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,660
Rym: It was just... And she did this dance kind of kick thing on stage.

722
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,480
Rym: It was just awesome.

723
00:41:17,921 --> 00:41:20,680
Rym: All the judges voted for her in like eight categories.

724
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,460
Rym: Like everything.

725
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,093
Scott: Yeah.

726
00:41:22,861 --> 00:41:24,440
Scott: It was sort of an obvious cosplay.

727
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,699
Scott: Like anyone could figure out who was supposed to win.

728
00:41:27,361 --> 00:41:28,089
Scott: It was just like, "Oh,

729
00:41:28,251 --> 00:41:28,736
Scott: obviously.".

730
00:41:29,163 --> 00:41:29,314
Scott: Yep.

731
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,980
Rym: But I mean other than that the cosplay went really well.

732
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,099
Rym: There was a big crowd for it.

733
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,980
Rym: A lot of parents in the audience because their kids were in the cosplay.

734
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:42,359
Scott: Yeah, it seemed like a lot of high school kids from nearby came to this thing and their parents were with them and then the parents took them home.

735
00:41:42,602 --> 00:41:44,339
Scott: So they didn't stay for the Late Night Awesomes.

736
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:49,880
Scott: Which I guess is good because we didn't actually strictly check IDs for all that stuff.

737
00:41:50,265 --> 00:41:50,310
Rym: No.

738
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,720
Scott: Like when we talked about hentais and stuff.

739
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,399
Rym: Yeah, so Saturday night there was a lot of awesome going on.

740
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:01,500
Rym: I mean, Happy House of Hentai did their Late Night Hentai panel, which was hilarious.

741
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,938
Rym: And there were a lot of people there.

742
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:13,480
Rym: And then after that the three of us, me, Scott, and Corbin, did Your Favorite Anime Sucks to pretty much until I think 2 a.m we did that for everyone who was left.

743
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,039
Scott: No, we did it way too much.

744
00:42:15,522 --> 00:42:16,260
Rym: It was great though.

745
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,680
Rym: I got to say that's a real easy panel to run and it's really funny.

746
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,920
Rym: And of course, Scott and I have seen mostly the same anime.

747
00:42:23,462 --> 00:42:25,456
Rym: So someone would say, "Make fun of Tenchi

748
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:25,778
Rym: Muyo."

749
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,957
Rym: "Make fun of Evangelion and Kawaii

750
00:42:27,977 --> 00:42:28,260
Rym: Bebop.".

751
00:42:28,321 --> 00:42:29,199
Rym: And we'd go nuts.

752
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:36,379
Rym: But then every time someone said an anime that neither one of us had seen and we give each other the look of, "Aw shit, this thing's breaking

753
00:42:36,399 --> 00:42:36,500
Rym: down.".

754
00:42:37,181 --> 00:42:40,479
Rym: Corbin would bust out and he'd know about the anime and he'd talk about it.

755
00:42:44,069 --> 00:42:45,080
Scott: Yeah, it was generally fun.

756
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:53,360
Scott: I mean, I'd like to see the actual, you know, Your Favorite Anime Sucks panel, whatever.

757
00:42:53,763 --> 00:42:54,639
Rym: Ah, ah, ma.

758
00:42:55,481 --> 00:42:58,159
Scott: Yeah, that way I could get a better idea of what I was supposed to do.

759
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,879
Scott: But just making it up as we went along worked pretty well.

760
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:07,879
Rym: Yeah, the crowd loved it so much that we ran it again in the morning and almost everyone who was there that night came back to see it again.

761
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:23,099
Scott: Yeah, it was pretty surprising that, you know, even though we did almost the same thing because they yelled out the same anime, I think what we need to do is we need to figure out which anime people will call out no matter what and write something really clever to say for every one of those.

762
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,940
Rym: Yeah, except we already had really clever stuff to say for all the big ones.

763
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,780
Scott: So we just need to write it down so we can, you know, save it again.

764
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,300
Rym: Yeah, I mean, we talked about Naruto for like a half hour at night.

765
00:43:32,521 --> 00:43:41,760
Scott: You know, that would actually be a good podcast, would be like, Your Favorite Anime Sucks, the podcast, where every week they just pick a new show and for five minutes they say why it sucks.

766
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:42,128
Scott: Huh.

767
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:48,719
Scott: And just keep going until you've done all the shows because there isn't a new anime every week, so you'd eventually get to them all.

768
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:58,860
Rym: Of course, the Sunday morning panel, we also went on a lot of tangents and talked a lot about just random funny con stories and actually a lot of stories we haven't told on the show yet.

769
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:06,779
Scott: Yeah, I think that's what you really have to do, though, for that panel because just saying why animes suck can get a little old because a lot of them is the same reason.

770
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:11,400
Scott: It's like, Naruto sucks are the same reason that Dragon Ball sucks and Bleach sucks.

771
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:13,619
Rym: And Yu Yu Hakusho, don't forget Yu Yu Hakusho.

772
00:44:14,013 --> 00:44:14,140
Rym: Yup.

773
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,380
Rym: That show had so much promise.

774
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:19,440
Scott: Yu Yu Hakusho is basically exactly like Naruto in its suckiness.

775
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:22,300
Scott: Early episodes, really promising, really good.

776
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,399
Scott: Then it turns into stupid fighting in the end.

777
00:44:25,441 --> 00:44:31,480
Rym: So, on Saturday we also ran the Anime Match Game which we had run often at the RIT Anime Club.

778
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,300
Scott: Didn't we talk about this already?

779
00:44:33,022 --> 00:44:34,040
Rym: We didn't talk about it in detail.

780
00:44:34,202 --> 00:44:34,479
Scott: Oh, okay.

781
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,759
Rym: We just talked about how Dave and Joel were really funny on it.

782
00:44:36,982 --> 00:44:37,259
Rym: Oh, okay.

783
00:44:37,962 --> 00:44:40,300
Rym: And we ran it, you know, it's the old 70s match game game show.

784
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:56,699
Rym: We have a bunch of celebrity guests up and Scott was one of them and I was the host and we'll say something like, "Ninja blank" and then the contestant says like, "Star" but then the other people write like, "Gaiden" or "Scroll" and then you have to match the celebrities and get points.

785
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:01,940
Scott: If you've ever watched the 70s game show, I think it's the 70s game show, it might be 60s, who knows?

786
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,260
Rym: No, it was 60s and it sucked and then it was redone in the 70s and it was hilarious.

787
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,240
Rym: It's one of the most famous game shows ever.

788
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:12,860
Scott: Yeah, it's a famous game show that kids nowadays don't know about unless they watch the Game Show Network which shows all the old game shows.

789
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:18,740
Rym: I felt so old that I actually had to explain the rules to this game show, this super popular game show.

790
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:24,240
Scott: It doesn't matter because it's real simple to understand and once people get what's going on, it's really entertaining.

791
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:30,120
Scott: It's really, it's not a show about winning and losing because there's really no skill or anything involved.

792
00:45:30,522 --> 00:45:33,380
Scott: It's just entertaining the audience with funny matches.

793
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:44,519
Rym: Yep, I mean especially when one comes out of nowhere where, you know, a guest puts down a really weird answer but then the contestant says something really weird and it works out and they win.

794
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:45,173
Scott: Yeah.

795
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,420
Rym: The crowd ate it up and we had a big crowd.

796
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,380
Rym: We're totally running this at a bunch of other cons.

797
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,639
Scott: We gotta run an anime match game wherever we can.

798
00:45:51,926 --> 00:45:52,011
Scott: Yeah.

799
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:53,900
Scott: We're gonna spread it around like a fire.

800
00:45:54,801 --> 00:45:55,399
Scott: A big fire.

801
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:00,020
Scott: Alright, so the con had a dealer's room which really wasn't so big.

802
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:06,540
Scott: There were one, two, three real dealers like that were selling merchandise that I can remember.

803
00:46:07,162 --> 00:46:12,600
Scott: There was the caffeinated press guys who we met and they were kind of okay cool dudes and they have a business.

804
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,179
Rym: Kind of okay cool dudes?

805
00:46:14,784 --> 00:46:18,380
Scott: They weren't, you know, 'cause we said so many other people are awesome.

806
00:46:18,904 --> 00:46:21,140
Scott: so I don't wanna say everyone's awesome.

807
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,559
Rym: You don't wanna dilute the awesome pool.

808
00:46:22,823 --> 00:46:23,240
Scott: Exactly.

809
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,260
Scott: They were cool guys though.

810
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:33,837
Scott: They were cool guys and they were taking pictures of people in cosplay and then selling them prints of the pictures with their little photo printer there and that's a cool thing to do.

811
00:46:34,722 --> 00:46:38,620
Scott: Then you think, you know, other cons, you know, most cons don't have someone doing that.

812
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,300
Scott: You know, Otakon has someone doing that.

813
00:46:40,441 --> 00:46:42,179
Rym: Well, most cons do, Scott.

814
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:43,769
Scott: No, what?

815
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:44,800
Scott: Most cons don't have that.

816
00:46:45,142 --> 00:46:47,500
Rym: Well, every middling to large con does.

817
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:55,160
Rym: The thing is it's usually set up in a very specific way and it's usually-- The only con that I've been to that has that is Otakon.

818
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,959
Rym: Otakon, KatsuCon, Anime Central, OhioCon had it.

819
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,178
Scott: OhioCon didn't have it.

820
00:47:01,061 --> 00:47:01,508
Rym: Yeah, it did.

821
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:02,380
Rym: OhioCon 2.

822
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,120
Rym: There was a photo suite.

823
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:10,160
Scott: Yeah, there's a photo suite, but it's not where you can get your picture taken and then they sell you a print.

824
00:47:10,662 --> 00:47:14,260
Scott: They take your picture and then they put it on their website or in their whatever and they show it to you.

825
00:47:14,743 --> 00:47:15,899
Rym: Yeah, they usually give it to you too.

826
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,539
Rym: Yeah, they do have the unique thing that they actually give you prints of it.

827
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:21,580
Scott: Yeah, they're selling you prints of the photos.

828
00:47:21,681 --> 00:47:35,078
Scott: I mean, you can go to a con like Anime Next, a fans view is there and you could go into the photo suite and a fans view would take your picture and put it on their website, but they weren't selling you printouts of your photo, you know, which is what these guys do.

829
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:43,419
Scott: And basically they're hoping that cons in the Northeast will outsource their photo suite to them for awesome, which is a great plan.

830
00:47:44,563 --> 00:47:49,880
Scott: And also in the dealer's room was this guy, I forget his name, I have his card I think, or Rym has his card.

831
00:47:49,941 --> 00:47:53,360
Rym: Yep, I got his card laying around in the pile of business cards I took from this guy.

832
00:47:53,620 --> 00:48:01,559
Scott: Yeah, he was an awesome guy and we started talking to him about how he went to, he was in Australia fighting whaling ships and he was a crazy awesome guy.

833
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:03,100
Rym: And he was promoting a Comic Con.

834
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:08,260
Scott: He was promoting the Syracuse Heroes Expo, which is what I was looking up when I was saying um before.

835
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,460
Rym: Yep, which we would have gone to if we didn't have prior commitments.

836
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:25,613
Scott: Yeah, so if you are anywhere near Syracuse and you like comics, anime, robots, anything like that, that's nerdy, go to SyracuseHeroesExpo.com and this guy was promoting it.

837
00:48:25,674 --> 00:48:28,480
Scott: so it must be good and it does actually look like a good time.

838
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:31,380
Scott: There's some people there that actually know.

839
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:37,480
Rym: And we're totally gonna get this guy on the show and interview him about just what he was doing in the waters of Australia.

840
00:48:38,321 --> 00:48:39,455
Scott: Yeah, oh that's right, C.B.

841
00:48:39,475 --> 00:48:40,880
Scott: Cebulski is gonna be there I think.

842
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,499
Scott: He's the guy who wrote X-Men Fairy Tales and he used to work for CPM.

843
00:48:46,301 --> 00:48:46,620
Rym: Yep, yep.

844
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:56,259
Scott: He's basically the guy who bridges the gap between the American underwear pervert comics and the world of manga and Japanese stuff.

845
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:02,800
Scott: He actually has a comic coming out in December that I called Wander Lost.

846
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,759
Scott: It's sort of semi-autobiographical deal.

847
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:08,439
Scott: I'm getting to the first issue just to see what's up.

848
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:11,280
Rym: Yep, but anyway the dealer's room was pretty small and typical.

849
00:49:11,561 --> 00:49:14,274
Rym: They would have liked to have more dealers to the point that we have friends.

850
00:49:14,294 --> 00:49:23,820
Rym: Luke and Gabby run an anime store in Rochester and when he heard that, he was willing to call them Friday night and invite them to come to the con and vent on Saturday.

851
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:26,480
Scott: Yeah, he really wanted more people in the dealer's room.

852
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:33,400
Rym: The thing is, not to disparage the dealers that were there, but Luke and Gabby's store could have blown them out of the water.

853
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:48,800
Scott: Yeah, they didn't have any really interesting stuff except one group was selling these really old Tops cards, these Tops collectible cards from Mario and Donkey Kong, the Mario and Donkey Kong game packs.

854
00:49:49,621 --> 00:49:54,560
Scott: And I bought two packs of Mario and a pack of Donkey Kong and they're really awesome.

855
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:55,758
Rym: It had the gum in it.

856
00:49:56,120 --> 00:50:04,480
Scott: Well, the Donkey Kong pack had the gum in it and I was gonna challenge someone to eat the gum or eat it myself, but part of the gum was brown.

857
00:50:05,341 --> 00:50:06,939
Scott: Yeah, there was either-- I still have the gum.

858
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:11,380
Scott: There was either something growing on it-- It's not getting any worse than it was three days ago.

859
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:15,080
Rym: Or some kind of industrial solvent has leaked into that shit.

860
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,380
Scott: I mean, this pack of gum is already really, really old.

861
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:21,440
Scott: It's not getting much older.

862
00:50:22,161 --> 00:50:28,080
Rym: But actually, the one dealer had Death Notes and he had a bunch of Nana stuff and I almost bought some.

863
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,920
Rym: And a Lockus Kline tumbler that I almost bought.

864
00:50:31,121 --> 00:50:32,479
Scott: A Lockus Kline tumbler, you say?

865
00:50:32,641 --> 00:50:33,279
Rym: It was pretty cool.

866
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,680
Rym: The problem with it was it looked really cool.

867
00:50:35,801 --> 00:50:45,199
Rym: except at the very bottom, there's a hint, I'm pretty sure that that was from some sort of not very kosher picture of Lockus.

868
00:50:45,883 --> 00:50:48,080
Rym: But that part was cropped out, so it looked cool.

869
00:50:48,481 --> 00:50:54,540
Rym: But I got this idea that it was probably taken from a not-so-savory picture of Lockus Kline.

870
00:50:54,741 --> 00:50:58,700
Scott: I was looking for some magnets, like refrigerator magnets of anime, and I didn't find any there.

871
00:50:59,642 --> 00:51:09,199
Scott: Oh, and also, Broccoli Entertainment sent Citicon a bunch of merchandise and they sold it at the Citicon table in the dealer's room along with the Citicon stuff.

872
00:51:10,943 --> 00:51:12,054
Scott: That was about the dealer's room.

873
00:51:12,316 --> 00:51:12,619
Scott: That's it.

874
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:18,700
Rym: Now, the rest of the con, they had a whole crazy ton of anime showings and they had a whole crazy ton of gaming.

875
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,756
Rym: They had a lot of video.

876
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,499
Scott: Yeah, there was a whole lot of Fullmetal Alchemist trading card game going on.

877
00:51:23,883 --> 00:51:24,574
Rym: And a lot of D&D.

878
00:51:25,461 --> 00:51:34,200
Scott: Yeah, there was a whole D&D campaign going on and I saw six or seven people in there playing it, which is a lot of people for a small convention like this.

879
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:39,360
Rym: I mean, you'd be in the artist alley, which was basically podcast alley, and there'd be no one around.

880
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:39,955
Rym: You're like, "What the

881
00:51:39,976 --> 00:51:40,059
Rym: hell?".

882
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:43,138
Rym: But then you go over to the other building and, "Oh, that's where everyone from the con

883
00:51:43,159 --> 00:51:43,260
Rym: is.".

884
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:46,260
Scott: There were always four guys playing Smash Brothers.

885
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:51,619
Scott: There were always two people playing DDR without pads using game pads instead of foot pads.

886
00:51:52,381 --> 00:51:58,880
Scott: And there were always six people playing D&D and five guys playing FMA, the trading card game, at all times.

887
00:51:59,681 --> 00:52:06,500
Rym: And a lot of people had DSs, but not as many people as other big cons, but there wasn't really so much opportunity to play DS games.

888
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,740
Scott: Yeah, we were too busy hanging out with all these guests, doing awesome stuff and talking about awesome stuff.

889
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:13,040
Scott: There wasn't a lot of DS playing.

890
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:19,159
Scott: Although the Night Shift podcast guy who hadn't really used a DS, he pickedo chatted.

891
00:52:19,802 --> 00:52:20,611
Scott: And he was like, "Aw,

892
00:52:20,631 --> 00:52:21,198
Scott: mans!".

893
00:52:21,867 --> 00:52:22,699
Scott: He was all about it.

894
00:52:23,442 --> 00:52:24,159
Rym: So much for the PSP.

895
00:52:24,861 --> 00:52:25,679
Scott: So much for it.

896
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:30,080
Scott: Yeah, he said he used the PSP and wasn't interested, so I think he might be going to get a DS.

897
00:52:30,321 --> 00:52:34,478
Scott: If someone can demonstrate to him that there's some games he'll like, he'll go for it.

898
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:42,339
Scott: I think he's an RPG guy, too, so there's some RPGs on the DS, especially when Children of Mana comes out and stuff.

899
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,760
Rym: Now here's an interesting thing that we noticed.

900
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:48,800
Rym: All the guests who were coming from the South smoked.

901
00:52:49,841 --> 00:52:50,940
Scott: Yeah, it was kind of crazy.

902
00:52:51,422 --> 00:52:55,219
Scott: Because up here in New York-- I don't think-- Happy House of Hentai, I don't think they smoked anything.

903
00:52:55,521 --> 00:52:56,260
Rym: I wasn't paying attention.

904
00:52:56,481 --> 00:52:57,279
Scott: Yeah, I don't think they did.

905
00:52:57,722 --> 00:52:58,580
Rym: I think one of them might have.

906
00:52:58,682 --> 00:52:59,599
Scott: Oh, one of them might have, yeah.

907
00:52:59,722 --> 00:53:00,440
Rym: That doesn't matter.

908
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:02,739
Rym: All entertainment systems smoked.

909
00:53:03,642 --> 00:53:07,354
Rym: But it was weird because they were complaining, "How can New York have these no-smoking

910
00:53:07,395 --> 00:53:07,677
Rym: laws?".

911
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:12,396
Rym: And all us New Yorkers were like, "New Jersey does, too, because not that many people smoke up

912
00:53:12,436 --> 00:53:12,577
Rym: here.".

913
00:53:13,342 --> 00:53:15,420
Scott: Yeah, we should have a thread on the forums.

914
00:53:15,781 --> 00:53:21,380
Scott: Tell us where you live, and tell us how many people smoke relative to the population.

915
00:53:21,701 --> 00:53:28,459
Rym: Granted, my assessment of bars in New York City before the smoking ban was a little biased in that I would never go into a smoking bar.

916
00:53:28,802 --> 00:53:30,620
Rym: And all the non-smoking bars are really nice.

917
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,300
Rym: There weren't really any non-smoking dive bars.

918
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:40,460
Rym: But by the same token, I saw a thing that less than 30% of New Yorkers smoke, and the smoking ban was a great thing.

919
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,719
Rym: Bars are making more money now.

920
00:53:42,301 --> 00:53:57,020
Scott: The thing is, you go on the street of New York City and walk around, it feels like there's a lot of smoking going on, because one guy smokes, the whole radius around him is coughing, and all these people can't smoke inside, so they're all on the street.

921
00:53:57,121 --> 00:54:01,039
Scott: So the sidewalks have a lot of smoke on them in general, especially near building entrances.

922
00:54:01,623 --> 00:54:08,560
Scott: But if you actually count the people, smoking and non-smoking, not too many people smoke up here in the Northeast in general.

923
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,740
Scott: I mean, sure they do, but not a lot.

924
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:14,980
Rym: Yeah, not nearly as much as the South, which I noticed the same thing at Animazement.

925
00:54:15,101 --> 00:54:18,260
Rym: A lot of the people coming to the con smoked outside.

926
00:54:18,921 --> 00:54:21,180
Rym: But at Otakon, I mean, hardly anyone smokes.

927
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:27,840
Scott: Yeah, if you looked at the people at this convention, total, it didn't seem like the con staff was smoking.

928
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,140
Scott: It didn't look like the con goers were smoking.

929
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:34,140
Scott: It was the guests that were from far away were like unanimously smoking.

930
00:54:34,941 --> 00:54:36,119
Rym: And bitching about New York.

931
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:44,720
Scott: And bitching about New York that, you know, we walked into Denny's and the guy was like, smoking, smoking, smoking, and we're like, there is no smoking section at all.

932
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,800
Rym: There hasn't been for a long time.

933
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:48,140
Scott: There hasn't been for years.

934
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:49,792
Scott: They're like, no way, dude.

935
00:54:49,812 --> 00:54:50,640
Scott: We're like, yeah, way.

936
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:56,397
Rym: Yeah, we're like, not only, but New York City had an even stricter law before the state one was passed and everyone was fine with it.

937
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:56,921
Scott: Yup.

938
00:54:58,218 --> 00:54:58,339
Scott: So.

939
00:54:59,385 --> 00:55:00,420
Rym: It was just interesting.

940
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:07,240
Scott: Yeah, it's like I haven't, you know, I had been away from smoking for a long, you know, a long time.

941
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:12,500
Scott: Like, I stopped noticing it because it was so, such a minor portion of the population.

942
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:20,018
Rym: Yeah, I mean, when I went to Raleigh for Animazement, and we went to a restaurant, and the waitress said smoking or none, and I was dumb, I was taken aback, like, what?

943
00:55:20,663 --> 00:55:22,839
Rym: Because no one has asked me that question in years.

944
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,670
Scott: Yeah, I remember when they stopped asking the question, I was like, ooh.

945
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:29,219
Scott: And then it took about two weeks to get used to not being asked.

946
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,980
Scott: And now when people ask, it's all weird all of a sudden.

947
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:37,220
Rym: Luckily, almost every place I go on a regular basis has banned smoking.

948
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:48,019
Scott: Yeah, I mean, but you look at my work day for the past six months is drive to the middle of nowhere alone where there's no smoking in my car, there's no smoking at my work where I'm alone, no smoking on the way back.

949
00:55:48,423 --> 00:55:50,420
Scott: I don't encounter smoke now, really.

950
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:53,400
Rym: See, I do, but that's because I go down to the Bronx and Yonkers.

951
00:55:55,480 --> 00:56:01,000
Rym: Interestingly, not a lot, but I'd say about 10% of the people at my company smoke.

952
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,617
Rym: I don't think anyone at my company under the age of 40 smokes.

953
00:56:05,547 --> 00:56:05,800
Scott: Wow.

954
00:56:06,021 --> 00:56:10,099
Rym: All the old men smoke and the old women smoke, but none of the younger people do at all.

955
00:56:11,023 --> 00:56:11,206
Scott: Huh.

956
00:56:11,612 --> 00:56:11,999
Scott: Alrighty then.

957
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:17,519
Rym: Yeah, anyway, the one thing I'd like to say is that Corbin, we've mentioned him a bunch of times, the con chair.

958
00:56:19,604 --> 00:56:23,179
Rym: We're not making fun of SUNY IT at all, but he is definitely a big fish in a small pond.

959
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:38,839
Scott: Yeah, I know, just with my assessment of people based on three days of interaction, Corbin and maybe three or four of the staff guys and girls that I noticed were awesome, big fish type people like us.

960
00:56:40,422 --> 00:56:42,920
Rym: We're not talking in terms of big ego or anything like that.

961
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:49,418
Rym: Just in terms of if they had been at RIT, they would have been pretty much guaranteed members of the front row crew.

962
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:49,962
Rym: Yeah.

963
00:56:49,982 --> 00:56:50,760
Rym: Without question.

964
00:56:51,361 --> 00:56:52,045
Scott: Look at Corbin.

965
00:56:52,085 --> 00:56:54,480
Scott: This guy is the president of the anime club.

966
00:56:54,741 --> 00:56:57,779
Scott: He's on their student government equivalent, whatever they call it.

967
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:02,520
Scott: He's running this big con pretty much all by himself and he's doing a really good job of it.

968
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,163
Rym: Yeah, a con.

969
00:57:03,203 --> 00:57:13,960
Rym: and honestly, it's interesting that this con in this little school had more staff and more stuff than ToraCon run by the biggest freaking anime club in the country.

970
00:57:14,701 --> 00:57:15,002
Scott: Yeah.

971
00:57:15,926 --> 00:57:21,120
Scott: If we had the people who attended ToraCon going to Sitacon, that would have been awesome.

972
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:24,620
Rym: Yeah, if ToraCon were staffed by the people from Sitacon, that would be one fuck of a con.

973
00:57:24,861 --> 00:57:26,420
Scott: It would be one hell of a con for sure.

974
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:33,140
Scott: But yeah, this guy was so awesome, yet the area he was in was so lame, he was like the king there.

975
00:57:33,841 --> 00:57:47,156
Rym: Yeah, I gotta say, after hanging out with him, I mean, no one really knew each other, but after we did one event and Corbin saw what we were all about and we talked a bit, we were fast friends and we'll probably be hanging out with this dude at any convention we all go to for

976
00:57:47,176 --> 00:57:47,600
Scott: the rest of the time.

977
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:52,199
Scott: Yeah, I imagine whenever we go to a con in the Northeast area, we'll be like, "Hey Corbin, you wanna go to this con?

978
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:52,834
Scott: Hang out with

979
00:57:52,896 --> 00:57:52,938
Scott: us?".

980
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:53,874
Scott: He'll be like, "Yeah, what's

981
00:57:53,976 --> 00:57:54,037
Scott: up?".

982
00:57:54,281 --> 00:57:57,420
Rym: Yeah, I'm definitely gonna drag him in if we get panels at bigger cons.

983
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:59,170
Scott: That's definitely a good idea.

984
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:00,540
Scott: Definitely a good idea.

985
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:07,580
Rym: I mean, all in all, Sitacon was well worth going, mostly for us because it was free and if nothing else...

986
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:10,360
Scott: Yeah, I don't know if it would have been worth it with the money you had.

987
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:14,859
Scott: Well, no, it would have been worth it simply because of the entertainment system and the video game pianist.

988
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:17,920
Rym: Yeah, that alone was worth more than what we would have paid to get in.

989
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:24,540
Scott: I think that if I lived where I live now, if I lived closer to the con, I would have gone all three days and done everything I could.

990
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:38,699
Scott: If I was an attendee of the con, living where I live now, I probably would have gone, paid the fee, just gone on Saturday, and mostly went to the concerts and the cosplay and not much else.

991
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:41,619
Rym: But from what I can... I mean, that seems what a lot of people did.

992
00:58:41,741 --> 00:58:45,539
Rym: But from what I can gather, the con was successful enough that they can probably throw it again.

993
00:58:46,102 --> 00:58:54,200
Rym: And now that it was successful, once, and that everyone who went seemed to have a really good time, I mean, no one was complaining about this con at all, from what I could see.

994
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:58,940
Scott: And next year, they'll pick a date that doesn't conflict with other cons in the area.

995
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:08,200
Scott: I mean, he tried to pick a date that didn't conflict with other cons, and then MangaNex jumped on him, which has pushed because he goes with AnimeNex, which is already an established con.

996
00:59:08,721 --> 00:59:10,940
Rym: But I think this con is going to be a phenomenon.

997
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:15,460
Rym: I mean, I think it's going to get big in the coming years, or at least it's going to stay and get more people and slowly grow.

998
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,500
Scott: It's pretty much going to be the New York State Anime Convention.

999
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:19,658
Scott: That's what I think it can be.

1000
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Rym: Yeah, because there aren't really any big cons upstate.

1001
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:26,460
Scott: Yeah, and mostly because New York City can't have anime cons.

1002
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:28,500
Rym: You can't have ten anime cons.

1003
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,534
Scott: Yeah, and the... Is there a Buffalo Anime Con?

1004
00:59:31,554 --> 00:59:32,179
Scott: I don't think so.

1005
00:59:32,341 --> 00:59:33,140
Rym: Yeah, there's Yubicon.

1006
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:33,843
Scott: Oh, is there?

1007
00:59:33,863 --> 00:59:36,100
Scott: That's right, but that's really small.

1008
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,580
Rym: Last time, Yubicon was... Or maybe it was two times ago.

1009
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:49,860
Rym: Yubicon was at the same time as Toricon, and all I remember is that I knew people who went to both, and I was at Toricon, and everyone who went to Yubicon came back and bitched that they should have went to Toricon instead.

1010
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:53,918
Scott: Yeah, the only other cons in the area would be...

1011
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:54,900
Rym: Well, Anime North.

1012
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:58,099
Scott: There's Anime North, which is in Canada, and that's about it.

1013
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:15,180
Scott: So I really think Cidicon, if they promote themselves more on the internets, because they didn't see them on Anime News Network or any of the other usual places, and if they run the con as well next year as they did this year, they can really basically get every anime fan in New York State to show up.

1014
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:18,940
Rym: And I can guarantee that we'll go to pretty much any Cidicon.

1015
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:21,920
Scott: Yeah, especially if they pay us to go and have us as guests.

1016
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,520
Rym: Even if they didn't, this con is... I mean, the hotel's in the air.

1017
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,320
Rym: You get a hotel for like 50 bucks a night.

1018
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,720
Scott: Yeah, there was a shady hotel for 54 bucks a night.

1019
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,520
Scott: But it wasn't that shady.

1020
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:34,040
Scott: Like, if you paid them 54 bucks, they would have given you a bed for a night.

1021
01:00:34,322 --> 01:00:37,500
Rym: Yeah, it's not going to be some kind of Monte Cristo thing where they kill you for your diamonds.

1022
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,959
Scott: Yeah, that was not what it was going to be, no.

1023
01:00:40,482 --> 01:00:41,560
Scott: But it was a little bit shady.

1024
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:46,840
Rym: And of course, to wrap up, we see we gained a bunch of listeners from Cidicon.

1025
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:48,359
Rym: We're glad you liked the show.

1026
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:49,240
Rym: Welcome.

1027
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,220
Scott: Yeah, listen to other episodes.

01:00:58,742 --> 01:01:00,420
Rym: Our forums are rocking.

1032
01:01:01,001 --> 01:01:02,019
Rym: There's a lot of people there.

1033
01:01:02,282 --> 01:01:04,100
Scott: There's a lot of people joining the forums lately.

1034
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:11,600
Scott: And all you people, if you join the forums and you don't get an email saying, "Congratulations, you have joined the forums," you're probably using Hotmail.

1035
01:01:12,401 --> 01:01:12,999
Scott: And guess what?

1036
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:14,559
Scott: Congratulations, you've joined the forums.

01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:15,256

01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,459
Rym: We personally approve them all.

1041
01:01:21,801 --> 01:01:23,700
Rym: We have never saw fit to turn someone away.

1042
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,460
Rym: And furthermore, we've only ever banned one person ever.

1043
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,280
Rym: And goddamn, was that kid annoying.

1044
01:01:28,763 --> 01:01:29,660
Scott: He was real annoying.

1045
01:01:31,687 --> 01:01:32,419
Rym: I think that's it.

1046
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:33,237
Scott: Yeah, I yawned.

1047
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:33,719
Scott: It's over.

1048
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:34,378
Rym: Yeah.

1049
01:01:35,923 --> 01:01:37,940
Rym: Stay tuned tomorrow when we'll talk about something.

1050
01:01:38,383 --> 01:01:38,738
Scott: Oh, God.

1051
01:01:46,021 --> 01:01:48,120
Rym: And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1052
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:50,759

1060
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:21,480
Scott: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
