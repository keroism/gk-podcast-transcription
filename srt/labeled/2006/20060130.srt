00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,757
Rym: It's Monday January 30th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,159 --> 00:00:13,440
Rym: tonight.

3
00:00:13,982 --> 00:00:19,840
Rym: We were going to talk about something else, but we end up just arguing with each other about Wikipedia for pretty much the entire episode.

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,538
Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:30,306
Rym: So as you all know I was out of town for the weekend back at my old alma mater or RIT in New York And I was sitting at home.

6
00:00:31,028 --> 00:00:35,540
Rym: Yeah, though magically I still did the episode fancy how that happened.

7
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,795
Scott: You know technology we have magical powers.

8
00:00:39,297 --> 00:00:39,860
Rym: actually it's funny.

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,900
Rym: We've always tried to get ahead on GeekNights like we try to record like bits to have around for days when we're tired.

10
00:00:46,061 --> 00:00:48,199
Scott: Or we record the bits and then we use them immediately.

11
00:00:49,121 --> 00:00:50,346
Rym: There was a time when we were ahead.

12
00:00:50,386 --> 00:00:55,544
Rym: we had three extra bits waiting around for whenever we had a day Or we didn't have enough stuff to talk about.

13
00:00:56,126 --> 00:00:59,859
Rym: we used them all almost immediately, and we've never gotten ahead since then.

14
00:01:00,746 --> 00:01:02,179
Scott: I don't think we're gonna get ahead ever.

15
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:17,780
Rym: But anyway I went to see the old RIT anime club and Despite the fact that I haven't been the president of that club for two years now The fact that I walked up on stage and everyone knew my name without me having to introduce myself made me feel very happy.

16
00:01:18,483 --> 00:01:21,799
Rym: But more importantly and well, I'll talk about this in much more depth tomorrow.

17
00:01:22,302 --> 00:01:31,704
Rym: But regarding the DS versus the PSP in terms of games I've got to say that the DS seems to be coming ahead as the clear winner In terms of games.

18
00:01:31,744 --> 00:01:40,427
Scott: I mean the PSP is a great video player, and I guess podcast receiver But I mean this anime club.

19
00:01:40,448 --> 00:01:47,709
Rym: there's you know 150 people give or take at the meeting and Many many many of them had their DS's with them.

20
00:01:48,392 --> 00:01:55,608
Rym: as in I tried to join a Mario Kart game And it filled up to the point that three or four people were like hey who's in this game?

21
00:01:55,628 --> 00:02:07,952
Rym: because I didn't make the cutoff and I was at the front of the room You know a big auditorium, and I just said to someone casually like all these kids with Mario Kart I'll school them and half the room yells what a bet.

22
00:02:08,032 --> 00:02:12,928
Rym: and they all whip out their DS's like bring it Yeah, and they got schooled.

23
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,760
Rym: I imagine yeah, I quite thoroughly hosed them.

24
00:02:16,162 --> 00:02:18,819
Scott: I just I don't think anyone just understands how to play that game.

25
00:02:19,302 --> 00:02:30,540
Rym: I mean honestly I just today I tried to play online and of the four races I did three of them ended with everyone I was racing against disconnecting before the end And one of them the last guy didn't disconnect.

26
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:38,060
Rym: So I actually got to finish it and rack up some victories And I think the only reason he stayed was because I kind of held back and let him win a couple races.

27
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:39,358
Rym: So he would think he had a chance.

28
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:41,849
Rym: Wow people just don't drift.

29
00:02:42,131 --> 00:02:43,620
Rym: They don't even read the instruction book.

30
00:02:45,301 --> 00:02:50,740
Scott: How did they beat like the 50 100 and 150 CC and all that stuff if they don't know what the hell?

31
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,184
Scott: They're doing.

32
00:02:51,385 --> 00:02:52,172
Rym: I don't think they did.

33
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:59,180
Scott: oh See if I was making the game I just wouldn't let you do online play until you or I would have come on.

34
00:02:59,601 --> 00:03:03,632
Scott: It's like everyone else has learned all these lessons of making online playable games.

35
00:03:03,692 --> 00:03:09,215
Scott: like you know even Warcraft would it be like Ranking the players and only people of certain rank.

36
00:03:09,235 --> 00:03:12,585
Scott: you would match them up People playing against noobs.

37
00:03:12,886 --> 00:03:22,039
Rym: no the reason there was a lot of reasons that can't work partly just because the games are real quick and There aren't that many people playing Mario Kart DS online at any given time.

38
00:03:22,561 --> 00:03:27,520
Rym: There are plenty of people playing Mario Kart DS to match up into quick games because people want to play almost immediately.

39
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:27,862
Rym: They're not.

40
00:03:28,185 --> 00:03:32,813
Rym: people don't want to sit around and wait a couple minutes While it finds good people for them to race.

41
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:33,898
Rym: They just want to race whoever's there.

42
00:03:34,743 --> 00:03:37,640
Rym: So it's not going to do a lot of matching up skills.

43
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,394
Scott: They should let you do the manual matching up like every other freaking game.

44
00:03:41,414 --> 00:03:42,840
Rym: Oh, this is a console thing.

45
00:03:42,961 --> 00:03:46,823
Rym: I don't think any DS games are going to do it the way you seem to expect In the way.

46
00:03:47,244 --> 00:03:55,492
Rym: every multiplayer game every multiplayer PC game where it's a completely different and Xbox Which is also a completely different type of game.

47
00:03:56,034 --> 00:03:57,240
Scott: It's not different at all.

48
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,996
Rym: Yeah, there's active servers, but you join as opposed to just randomly hooking up with people out of the blue.

49
00:04:02,016 --> 00:04:05,528
Scott: No There's no on the Xbox.

50
00:04:05,568 --> 00:04:06,632
Scott: There are no servers.

51
00:04:06,672 --> 00:04:07,716
Rym: Yeah, I didn't say Xbox.

52
00:04:07,736 --> 00:04:08,760
Rym: Let's talk about just PC games.

53
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:09,865
Scott: I'm just saying and yet.

54
00:04:09,885 --> 00:04:10,729
Scott: There's no reason.

55
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,286
Scott: there's no technological reason or Reason.

56
00:04:14,366 --> 00:04:16,616
Rym: there's a lot of logistical reasons like what.

57
00:04:16,898 --> 00:04:22,841
Rym: the main reason I think is that most people who seem to have the DS aren't very tech savvy and don't know or care about any of that Stuff.

58
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,598
Scott: they can see a list of games and join it.

59
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:29,540
Scott: I mean MSN zones and Yahoo games have lists of games and you join one.

60
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,440
Rym: You know we work for Mario Kart the way it's set up Mario Kart you race for racing is done.

61
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,303
Rym: It takes about five minutes.

62
00:04:34,323 --> 00:04:39,905
Scott: if someone clicks create new race and then beat three people join it and then they click go And then it.

63
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:42,340
Scott: you know if you see one that you want to play and you click on it.

64
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,310
Rym: Nintendo wanted this to be so simple.

65
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,260
Rym: you don't even have to do anything you just yeah.

66
00:04:46,341 --> 00:04:47,026
Scott: But there's a point.

67
00:04:47,147 --> 00:04:52,636
Scott: you know making it simple is all good You know, but there's a point at which you make it so simple that it's not.

68
00:04:52,736 --> 00:04:53,660
Rym: I have no problem with that.

69
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,098
Rym: The only problems I have with the game or that most of the people who play are just terrible.

70
00:04:57,179 --> 00:05:00,612
Scott: yes And the way to solve that problem is to do exactly what I say.

71
00:05:00,632 --> 00:05:02,820
Rym: no cuz I don't think that would help all right.

72
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,269
Scott: So what do you think would help mr.. Genius?

73
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:04,873
Rym: I don't care.

74
00:05:04,893 --> 00:05:06,000
Rym: I just don't care.

75
00:05:07,021 --> 00:05:07,423
Rym: Wait wait.

76
00:05:07,623 --> 00:05:08,085
Scott: so you're like.

77
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,009
Scott: I have one like.

78
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:12,424
Scott: I don't think that your your suggestion is a solution I don't care.

79
00:05:12,444 --> 00:05:15,040
Rym: There is no solution cuz I didn't say it as it's a problem.

80
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:15,563
Rym: It's just that's.

81
00:05:15,824 --> 00:05:16,307
Rym: there's one.

82
00:05:16,488 --> 00:05:18,398
Rym: the only thing that's bothered me about the game.

83
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,911
Scott: wait I thought you didn't care, but now you're saying it bothers you.

84
00:05:20,931 --> 00:05:24,086
Rym: I Don't care as in it's not an issue.

85
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:24,889
Rym: I worry about.

86
00:05:25,251 --> 00:05:30,238
Rym: it's just like oh this game is perfect except for this one thing but it's not anything that I care enough about to worry about.

87
00:05:30,258 --> 00:05:37,183
Rym: and Mostly considering the fact that the game's out And it can't be changed unless they release a new game It doesn't matter at all.

88
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:41,437
Scott: no in the future the other games should do things properly and not be all.

89
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:43,757
Rym: yeah third parties Well, I don't think Nintendo games will.

90
00:05:44,474 --> 00:05:45,884
Scott: Yeah well Then they're gonna have a problem.

91
00:05:45,904 --> 00:05:54,340
Rym: because I've noticed the only people who really care about this seem to be the crazy fanboys in Like a few sections of the game facts forums and everyone else just seems kind of different.

92
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,480
Scott: They just play well because you know they play But they keep quitting and jumping out.

93
00:05:59,102 --> 00:06:08,134
Rym: Discover that most of the people who quit do so actively because they they have this thing against people who snake or people who mini-turbo And if they see you do it they quit immediately because they.

94
00:06:08,275 --> 00:06:08,999
Rym: that's what if?

95
00:06:09,059 --> 00:06:20,580
Scott: anyway I see if Nintendo keeps doing this sort of automatic matching up You know thing with all their games, and they don't have you know proper matchups or something proper in your eyes anyway.

96
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:24,368
Scott: If they don't do that think about when like Smash Brothers Revolution is gonna come out.

97
00:06:24,408 --> 00:06:26,200
Scott: people are gonna be dropping out all over the place.

98
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:36,040
Scott: You're never gonna be able to get a game on and people will say you know I really love playing Smash Brothers online But it really sucks because you can't really get a game going on because people just quit all over the place.

99
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:43,997
Scott: They need to learn the lessons that everyone else has already learned in the past Fundamentally different types of games, and it's not fundamentally different.

100
00:06:44,058 --> 00:06:45,643
Rym: anyway I thought it's a game.

101
00:06:45,704 --> 00:06:46,546
Scott: just play it online.

102
00:06:46,566 --> 00:06:47,991
Rym: look at counter-strike counter-strike.

103
00:06:48,011 --> 00:06:48,693
Rym: You have a server.

104
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:50,679
Rym: That's going constantly and people come and go.

105
00:06:51,705 --> 00:06:52,189
Rym: Mario Kart.

106
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:53,419
Rym: you can't just have people come and go.

107
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:55,793
Rym: Everyone has to start at the same time and end at the same time.

108
00:06:56,195 --> 00:06:59,775
Rym: yeah, so So you'd have to completely rework how it works.

109
00:06:59,815 --> 00:07:00,358
Rym: you have to make it.

110
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,548
Scott: look at Yahoo games backgammon.

111
00:07:02,568 --> 00:07:04,838
Scott: everyone joins at the same time and ends at the same time.

112
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:07,730
Scott: yeah Yeah, any yahoo game you know everyone.

113
00:07:08,192 --> 00:07:15,598
Scott: some guy says new game people join it It fills up the guy who started it clicks start everyone plays and then when it's over.

114
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:15,940
Scott: It's over.

115
00:07:16,362 --> 00:07:20,280
Rym: Yeah, there's more overhead for a real-time game like Mario Kart as opposed to backgammon.

116
00:07:21,022 --> 00:07:30,732
Scott: There are real-time games on Yahoo games and msn zones and all those other stupid little online things that If you're gonna complain about it then do something.

117
00:07:30,752 --> 00:07:31,715
Rym: complain to someone who cares.

118
00:07:32,136 --> 00:07:44,895
Scott: I'm worried because I Think what's gonna happen is if Nintendo keeps the system this way the Nintendo online experience will continue to be Subpar and eventually people will be like oh who cares if it has Wi-Fi?

119
00:07:44,915 --> 00:07:48,919
Scott: the Nintendo Wi-Fi sucks You can never get a game on and it's always a bunch of losers and quitters.

120
00:07:49,382 --> 00:07:54,787
Rym: See I think part of the problem is just the types of people who are on the Wi-Fi are Generally poor as I've discovered.

121
00:07:54,868 --> 00:07:56,695
Scott: yes, and there's no way to control that.

122
00:07:56,815 --> 00:07:57,598
Scott: so you have to have.

123
00:07:57,618 --> 00:07:59,669
Scott: you know You did some sort of system.

124
00:07:59,709 --> 00:07:59,870
Scott: Well.

125
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:00,816
Rym: You know what my system is.

126
00:08:00,937 --> 00:08:01,460
Rym: I play with people.

127
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,493
Rym: I know I am in counter-strike and natural selection.

128
00:08:04,895 --> 00:08:06,100
Rym: I didn't just join random servers.

129
00:08:06,241 --> 00:08:08,920
Rym: I found a few servers that always had good people, and I was always join them.

130
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:11,801
Scott: Yeah, I did that too, but the thing is so with this I just.

131
00:08:11,882 --> 00:08:12,986
Rym: I only play with my friends.

132
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:13,589
Rym: like I am.

133
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:14,372
Rym: I am someone.

134
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:22,060
Rym: hey you want to play Mario Kart alright Get whoever I can get together, and we just play yeah, but eventually they gets pretty old and people aren't always available play.

135
00:08:22,723 --> 00:08:25,760
Rym: I have enough people on my list now to where people are pretty much always available to play.

136
00:08:26,302 --> 00:08:27,829
Scott: But they're not also choosing friends.

137
00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:28,552
Scott: They're choosing other.

138
00:08:28,572 --> 00:08:31,840
Rym: knowing as in I I am them and say hey Let's all play and then we all pick friends.

139
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,809
Rym: No one just picks friends and goes there.

140
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:34,775
Rym: aren't a people in your friends list.

141
00:08:34,796 --> 00:08:37,378
Scott: for that to ever work You could have a crazy friends list.

142
00:08:37,398 --> 00:08:38,082
Scott: well I hope there's a.

143
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,942
Rym: there's a very small limit to how many people can be in your friends list and then it starts knocking them Off.

144
00:08:42,224 --> 00:08:43,130
Scott: it's pretty big though.

145
00:08:43,171 --> 00:08:44,460
Scott: It's like 40 or something.

146
00:08:44,661 --> 00:08:45,645
Rym: It's not that many people.

147
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:49,140
Rym: the odds of four of them being online at any given time are pretty slim.

148
00:08:49,482 --> 00:08:50,509
Scott: It's like 40 years.

149
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,214
Scott: That's

150
00:08:51,255 --> 00:08:51,960
Rym: not so many

151
00:08:52,921 --> 00:09:07,980
Scott: It's plenty because what people do is they join me they go online and they whatever website that they're affiliated with they you know add Everyone on that site to their friends list and they all do it for each other and they lock them in and then they always Say all right everyone always pick friends whenever you play, and they always seem to get games together.

152
00:09:08,663 --> 00:09:09,486
Rym: You haven't done it at all.

153
00:09:09,526 --> 00:09:11,332
Rym: You just you're using anecdotal evidence there.

154
00:09:11,694 --> 00:09:12,135
Rym: You don't know.

155
00:09:12,256 --> 00:09:13,340
Rym: you don't know people are doing it.

156
00:09:14,142 --> 00:09:15,316
Rym: Most of the people I see do it.

157
00:09:15,336 --> 00:09:18,208
Rym: they Organize games in real time as an art.

158
00:09:18,248 --> 00:09:20,236
Rym: Let's play now, or they schedule a game.

159
00:09:20,276 --> 00:09:21,100
Rym: Let's play it this time.

160
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,125
Scott: Yeah, that's your people.

161
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:22,848
Scott: That's not the people.

162
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:24,677
Rym: I see yeah, you didn't play the game.

163
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:25,179
Rym: What do you know?

164
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,347
Scott: Yeah, there's a reason.

165
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:26,753
Scott: I don't play.

166
00:09:26,773 --> 00:09:29,607
Scott: the game is Impossible to get a game online together.

167
00:09:29,647 --> 00:09:30,310
Scott: that doesn't suck.

168
00:09:30,451 --> 00:09:32,720
Rym: Oh you won't play against us when we're over either.

169
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,475
Rym: I think it's because you're not so good anymore because I'm disillusioned with it.

170
00:09:35,515 --> 00:09:36,239
Scott: It's not so great.

171
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,832
Rym: Yeah, I think Where you were saying it's the greatest Mario Kart ever.

172
00:09:42,033 --> 00:09:42,696
Scott: cuz it was.

173
00:09:42,717 --> 00:09:43,420
Rym: and the game.

174
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,871
Rym: The game is the same game that you said was awesome.

175
00:09:46,911 --> 00:09:48,820
Scott: nothing changed because I hadn't played the whole game.

176
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,725
Scott: It's like a magic.

177
00:09:49,765 --> 00:09:51,153
Rym: I mean you hadn't played the whole game.

178
00:09:51,313 --> 00:09:52,480
Scott: I hadn't played the whole game at that.

179
00:09:52,863 --> 00:09:53,670
Scott: I just got it.

180
00:09:53,992 --> 00:09:54,839
Rym: What hadn't you played?

181
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,531
Scott: Most of the game, what do you mean, so you met.

182
00:09:57,551 --> 00:09:58,918
Rym: you found a track that you didn't like?

183
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:01,184
Rym: No, there was.

184
00:10:01,445 --> 00:10:03,492
Rym: you discovered a character that ruins the game.

185
00:10:03,572 --> 00:10:09,912
Scott: barely played it online at that point and The I at that point it didn't even work online.

186
00:10:09,952 --> 00:10:15,875
Scott: at first the online was completely broken Right and - I don't even beat the game, so I didn't know what was like.

187
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:16,900
Scott: a man doesn't do anything.

188
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:21,919
Scott: Yeah, it does you figure out what it's like on the the faster modes and such?

189
00:10:22,961 --> 00:10:25,713
Rym: Okay And it was a fully play.

190
00:10:25,754 --> 00:10:31,120
Scott: the entire game There's a lot of you know is like no one can watch the first five minutes of a movie And it's the greatest thing in the road.

191
00:10:32,361 --> 00:10:37,320
Rym: Playing playing even one of the 50cc isn't much different from playing the hardest hundred and fifty CC.

192
00:10:38,842 --> 00:10:40,212
Scott: My impression of the game changes.

193
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:41,280
Scott: I played more and more of it.

194
00:10:41,421 --> 00:10:44,799
Rym: I think your impression of the game changed as you got worse and worse at it compared to everyone else.

195
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:46,172
Scott: No, I don't think so.

196
00:10:46,192 --> 00:10:58,778
Scott: uh-huh I think that You know just cuz I don't want to play a game because I don't like it and you really want to play against me And I don't want to see you come up with some thing you know to try to be like.

197
00:10:59,946 --> 00:11:01,719
Scott: If you're not playing with me that must mean you suck.

198
00:11:02,181 --> 00:11:07,446
Rym: Well, I mean I noticed that you've wanted to play with me all the time when the game first came out until I beat you And then you never.

199
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:08,735
Rym: you haven't played me since that one time.

200
00:11:08,775 --> 00:11:11,748
Scott: I pick your ass Nothing to do with it.

201
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,420
Rym: I just seems quite a coincidence.

202
00:11:13,802 --> 00:11:19,718
Rym: You know you're kicking my ass you're beating me, and then one day I kick your ass into the ground, and then you never play again.

203
00:11:21,201 --> 00:11:23,898
Scott: Because maybe that just happened to be the time and I have other stuff to do.

204
00:11:25,943 --> 00:11:27,392
Rym: All right you had other things to do.

205
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:28,379
Rym: it just happened to coincide.

206
00:11:28,661 --> 00:11:29,143
Scott: What am?

207
00:11:29,203 --> 00:11:31,133
Scott: I had free time to play this movie game.

208
00:11:31,535 --> 00:11:32,319
Rym: plenty of free time?

209
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:32,400
Scott: No?

210
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:32,741
Scott: I don't.

211
00:11:32,762 --> 00:11:33,869
Scott: what do I have free time?

212
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:35,440
Rym: He sat around for hours today?

213
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,271
Rym: Just watching last exile and dickin her.

214
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:38,660
Scott: I was watching last exile.

215
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,858
Scott: Yeah, whatever, and then I was eating dinner, and then I was doing groceries, and I was doing laundry pizzas.

216
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:44,826
Scott: Yeah, now.

217
00:11:44,847 --> 00:11:50,479
Scott: I'm making a podcast All right, and then I gotta go mess with my video card, and then I had to go to bed.

218
00:11:51,203 --> 00:11:57,274
Rym: Oh, I guess that's at least somewhat topical because well, it's not video game day It is sci-tech day, and I guess there's technology involved in the DS.

219
00:11:57,716 --> 00:12:05,969
Rym: Yeah Though the only other thing I did in Rochester is I caught an Amex game hockey for those of you who don't know Mm-hmm, and that's one like.

220
00:12:05,989 --> 00:12:10,890
Rym: I've seen a bunch of different types of hockey different leagues whatever But I'd never seen that level of hockey.

221
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:11,633
Scott: Yeah, you had.

222
00:12:11,693 --> 00:12:13,540
Scott: we went to it in Bridgeport, Connecticut.

223
00:12:14,103 --> 00:12:14,826
Scott: Did we win?

224
00:12:15,288 --> 00:12:17,860
Scott: we went to see the Hartford Wolfpack play the?

225
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:19,960
Scott: Bridgeport Sound Tigers.

226
00:12:21,602 --> 00:12:22,466
Scott: Yeah, well we did.

227
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:23,250
Scott: you were there.

228
00:12:25,431 --> 00:12:33,900
Rym: Yeah And the Amherst won, but I got to say that hot level of hockey is really not so great.

229
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:35,583
Scott: Yeah, it is.

230
00:12:35,944 --> 00:12:40,400
Rym: they were pretty terrible like I've seen the high school and college teams that just had better puck control.

231
00:12:40,841 --> 00:12:41,945
Scott: Well the Amherst were the.

232
00:12:42,467 --> 00:12:44,132
Scott: I think they won last year didn't they?

233
00:12:44,152 --> 00:12:47,600
Rym: yeah, and you know what they're doing pretty poorly And they were on a losing streak.

234
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,839
Rym: And then they beat this team by as far as I can tell sheer lock and just by out shooting him.

235
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:59,340
Scott: Maybe they lost with the good players last year because they won so that all their players went to the NHL or something who knows?

236
00:12:59,460 --> 00:12:59,721
Rym: I don't know.

237
00:12:59,762 --> 00:13:01,628
Rym: It was still fun though the coolest thing was there.

238
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:07,210
Rym: We had an exchange student with us and He'd never seen hockey before never seen hockey.

239
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:07,671
Scott: where's he from?

240
00:13:07,691 --> 00:13:08,996
Scott: oh god.

241
00:13:09,016 --> 00:13:09,960
Rym: I don't remember South America.

242
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,545
Scott: I think they don't have hockey.

243
00:13:12,087 --> 00:13:13,130
Rym: most people don't have hockey.

244
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,237
Rym: hockey is not popular in most of the world.

245
00:13:15,558 --> 00:13:17,919
Rym: in fact the majority Of the world is and they don't even know what exists.

246
00:13:18,141 --> 00:13:19,680
Rym: They don't even know what exists in most of the world.

247
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:25,740
Scott: I mean I did searches for hockey in strange places, and I found like weird scary hockey leagues in like Japan.

248
00:13:25,981 --> 00:13:30,100
Rym: Oh, yeah, but as far as the world's concerned most people just don't care at all about hockey.

249
00:13:30,301 --> 00:13:31,707
Scott: Well those people don't care about most sports.

250
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:37,140
Rym: Hockey is very much a northern American Canadian Russian and northern Europe.

251
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:47,179
Scott: There's a Harris poll the other day, and it was like how many people you know care about sports, and it was like 20% 80% of people just don't care about any sports at all just that.

252
00:13:48,201 --> 00:13:49,307
Rym: But he'd never seen hockey before.

253
00:13:49,849 --> 00:13:51,980
Rym: so we were describing it to him because he really liked soccer.

254
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,679
Rym: He's good at soccer.

255
00:13:52,981 --> 00:14:02,255
Rym: It's almost saying that it's a lot like soccer and that it's low scoring and goaltending means a lot and breakaways blah blah blah Mm-hmm, and then we described yeah, but there's like and he's.

256
00:14:02,315 --> 00:14:06,760
Rym: he heard that it's violent But he'd heard a little bit like he'd heard of hockey, and he knew it was violent.

257
00:14:07,523 --> 00:14:09,303
Rym: So we explained yeah It's real violent.

258
00:14:09,564 --> 00:14:22,175
Rym: in fact if two guys get into a fight on the ice the refs aren't allowed to break it up until someone Wins mm-hmm and sure enough not five minutes into the second period Two guys throw down their gloves and duke it out all right.

259
00:14:22,336 --> 00:14:23,180
Rym: It was fantastic.

260
00:14:23,581 --> 00:14:24,424
Scott: That's what's all about.

261
00:14:25,046 --> 00:14:29,360
Scott: you go to the shittiest talking game in the world the worst teams ever and a fight will break out.

262
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,946
Scott: It'll be worth the price.

263
00:14:30,986 --> 00:14:34,420
Rym: It was a fun game, and I won the lottery at it of all things.

264
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:39,217
Rym: Oh really yeah lottery for what New York State Lottery was there or something?

265
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:43,477
Rym: and this there You know the t-shirt girls that come out of sporting events, and they throw t-shirts if you mean Stephanie.

266
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,910
Rym: yeah Well I caught a t-shirt, and I was very happy with it, and I opened it.

267
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,640
Rym: It's just a math tax shirt uh-huh.

268
00:14:53,281 --> 00:14:58,209
Scott: Well you can proudly wear that at your next Bingo night or whatever.

269
00:14:58,249 --> 00:15:03,779
Rym: yeah, yeah, hi Rola Big winner no whammy no whammy no whammy stop.

270
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,148
Scott: Well, and let's see what did I do this weekend?

271
00:15:07,168 --> 00:15:08,032
Scott: I sat around.

272
00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:08,935
Rym: didn't you buy a car?

273
00:15:08,955 --> 00:15:10,060
Scott: Yeah, I bought a car.

274
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:15,031
Scott: I went to those board game guys played some nice new board games.

275
00:15:15,633 --> 00:15:16,897
Scott: You know met some people.

276
00:15:17,038 --> 00:15:17,580
Scott: they were cool.

277
00:15:18,406 --> 00:15:19,353
Scott: The board games are fun.

278
00:15:21,381 --> 00:15:23,227
Rym: If I talk about them tomorrow and gaming day.

279
00:15:23,247 --> 00:15:25,495
Rym: yeah, cuz we already talked today about the DS.

280
00:15:25,515 --> 00:15:26,438
Rym: I don't need to repeat that.

281
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:40,260
Scott: no You know pretty usual sitting around looking around great walking around looking around That sort of thing yeah, I had to defrag the hard drive in this computer windows box.

282
00:15:40,701 --> 00:15:45,738
Rym: Yeah, this laptop here the work one see I'm not used to the idea of defragging anymore.

283
00:15:45,758 --> 00:15:46,119
Rym: neither.

284
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,948
Scott: It was like don't use windows like oh, yeah, so apparently unless you have 15% of your hard drive for you Can't really defrag properly.

285
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:55,827
Rym: Oh, yeah system administration That's like the number one thing.

286
00:15:55,847 --> 00:16:03,740
Rym: if you want to defrag a server's hard drive That's because a lot of servers just having to be windows for various reasons You usually just copy all the data to another drive and then back.

287
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,293
Rym: That's the by far the best way to defragment a hard drive in Windows.

288
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:15,219
Scott: Yeah, so I Can't get enough data deleted off of this to defrag it properly.

289
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:18,493
Rym: well Then buy an external drive copy everything to it and copy it back.

290
00:16:18,513 --> 00:16:19,256
Rym: It's not my.

291
00:16:19,276 --> 00:16:20,240
Scott: this is a works computer.

292
00:16:20,301 --> 00:16:22,099
Rym: I'm not doing shit and tell them to do that.

293
00:16:22,622 --> 00:16:30,094
Scott: I'm gonna tell that I'm probably just gonna get a new hard drive for it and take the one out of here and put a new one in Whatever whatever because it's really too small.

294
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:30,537
Scott: It's only 40 gigs.

295
00:16:31,681 --> 00:16:32,326
Rym: That's plenty.

296
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,100
Rym: you shouldn't need to have much on that laptop.

297
00:16:34,268 --> 00:16:36,748
Scott: No It's full of shit from the guy who had it before me.

298
00:16:36,988 --> 00:16:38,493
Rym: delete all that I can't.

299
00:16:38,614 --> 00:16:39,095
Rym: why not?

300
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:43,515
Scott: because it's like Licensed software and company crap and it sucks.

301
00:16:43,575 --> 00:16:49,019
Scott: it sucks having a computer That's not yours and having to use just booted Ubuntu live CD every time you want to use it.

302
00:16:49,623 --> 00:16:51,035
Scott: I can't cuz actually stuff on it.

303
00:16:51,075 --> 00:16:52,942
Scott: I have to use Wine.

304
00:16:52,982 --> 00:16:53,284
Rym: man.

305
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:56,820
Scott: no like blackberry shit.

306
00:16:58,001 --> 00:16:59,326
Rym: Get all that to work in one.

307
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:00,049
Scott: not really.

308
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:01,052
Rym: yeah, you ever tried.

309
00:17:01,514 --> 00:17:01,675
Scott: No.

310
00:17:01,715 --> 00:17:02,437
Scott: It's not worth it.

311
00:17:02,718 --> 00:17:04,364
Rym: I could look I'm kind of a wine expert.

312
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:06,010
Scott: Yeah for real.

313
00:17:06,712 --> 00:17:08,519
Rym: It's pretty much my job at IBM lately.

314
00:17:09,386 --> 00:17:09,993
Scott: sucks to be you.

315
00:17:11,023 --> 00:17:17,839
Rym: But anyway to actually move into our real news We got one bit since we figured we'd talk long after the long weekend.

316
00:17:18,261 --> 00:17:21,654
Rym: But Wikipedia has had some trouble like in the past.

317
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:23,300
Rym: You know there's people who vandalize Wikipedia.

318
00:17:23,401 --> 00:17:33,100
Rym: They'll go into a post about I don't know Strawberries and just add like aliens to it or just they'll replace an entire article with the word fuck.

319
00:17:33,281 --> 00:17:35,200
Rym: You know just people vandalizing for no good reason.

320
00:17:36,161 --> 00:17:40,297
Rym: Lately the people who have been vandalized in Wikipedia have been wait for it.

321
00:17:41,421 --> 00:17:43,831
Rym: Members of the Congress of the United States of America?

322
00:17:43,971 --> 00:17:45,758
Scott: well not personally, but their staff.

323
00:17:45,979 --> 00:17:49,290
Rym: yeah They're staffers sometimes on their orders sometimes on their own.

324
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,999
Rym: It's it really is a tricky situation here.

325
00:17:52,862 --> 00:17:59,500
Scott: But basically Wikipedia has articles on just about everything and absolutely everything even scary things you didn't know about.

326
00:17:59,802 --> 00:18:03,524
Rym: Yep, and as you all know I often write for Wikipedia though I do so anonymously.

327
00:18:03,825 --> 00:18:09,634
Rym: usually I find pseudoscience, and I flag it as such as Vitriloquy as I possibly can.

328
00:18:09,675 --> 00:18:10,339
Scott: that's not a word.

329
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,406
Rym: Vitrilo is a word.

330
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:18,240
Scott: add suffixes to words you don't say Vitriloquy you say with much vitriol.

331
00:18:19,324 --> 00:18:21,860
Rym: Yeah, you know what it has the same meaning and you know what I meant.

332
00:18:22,422 --> 00:18:28,700
Rym: And I feel that making a word like that by adding suffixes and or prefixes is perfectly grammatically legitimate.

333
00:18:28,961 --> 00:18:31,874
Scott: Well, then you can't yell at me when I do it anymore.

334
00:18:32,095 --> 00:18:33,140
Rym: I don't yell at you when you do that.

335
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,436
Rym: Yeah, I yell at you, and you freaking make up words or use adverbs and adjectives incorrectly.

336
00:18:37,496 --> 00:18:38,460
Scott: you just made up a word.

337
00:18:38,641 --> 00:18:39,269
Scott: So there you go.

338
00:18:40,241 --> 00:18:45,783
Rym: There's a difference in making up a word and they can have a word and making up a word You just make up.

339
00:18:46,165 --> 00:18:49,960
Rym: I mean adding a suffix to a word is not in the same class as stringing eight letters together.

340
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:51,010
Scott: Yeah, it is.

341
00:18:51,091 --> 00:18:51,960
Scott: It's making up a word.

342
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,703
Scott: It's not a word.

343
00:18:52,824 --> 00:18:53,366
Scott: you made it up.

344
00:18:53,747 --> 00:18:58,906
Rym: you realize a large portion of the words in English language Would wouldn't really be in the dictionary.

345
00:18:58,946 --> 00:19:01,052
Rym: They're just a root word plus a prefix or suffix.

346
00:19:01,514 --> 00:19:03,580
Rym: Yeah, or they're just completely made up.

347
00:19:05,241 --> 00:19:08,354
Rym: No a lot of words in English that we use today were made up.

348
00:19:08,434 --> 00:19:09,840
Rym: Shakespeare made up a whole bunch of words.

349
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:11,992
Scott: Oh Shakespeare was allowed to make a whole bunch of words.

350
00:19:12,093 --> 00:19:13,300
Scott: Why cuz he was Shakespeare?

351
00:19:13,846 --> 00:19:15,140
Scott: Yeah, you're not.

352
00:19:16,464 --> 00:19:17,391
Rym: We'll see about that.

353
00:19:17,754 --> 00:19:30,059
Rym: Yeah, well Where your collected works, but anyway among all the articles Wikipedia has they obviously have articles about politics and political parties and members of Congress and things of that nature.

354
00:19:30,626 --> 00:19:52,751
Rym: Mmm, well Members of Congress who say do something bad and then that something bad is in an article on Wikipedia Had their staffers go around either deleting it or deleting the articles entirely or creatively editing articles about them to make them look better or Astro turfing or all sorts of just nefarious activity.

355
00:19:52,771 --> 00:20:08,536
Rym: and it's actually fairly widespread to the point that Wikipedia Considered it an emergency as they tend to consider things like that and they blocked the Congress's IP addresses from accessing Wikipedia or editing Wikipedia for a week while they debate what to do about it.

356
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:11,249
Scott: Awesome Give them what for I?

357
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,836
Scott: really think that I don't know.

358
00:20:14,897 --> 00:20:19,220
Scott: it's like There should be some sort of a system in Wikipedia where?

359
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:29,797
Scott: There's some sort of nomination and election, you know how like Gentoo works where each package has a maintainer, you know There's an official maintainer of the package, right?

360
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:39,420
Scott: and So like there's an e-build for the gimp and there's some guy who Jahu's job It is is to maintain that e-build.

361
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:48,080
Scott: So when the gimp is updated he has to update the e-build and if there's something wrong with the e-build He has to fix it and it's all his job and he's assigned to it.

362
00:20:48,261 --> 00:20:53,122
Scott: Sure, you can edit the e-build and you could send in like a submission to him like hey check this out You could do.

363
00:20:53,162 --> 00:20:55,091
Scott: this is better, but it's up to him.

364
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:56,839
Scott: He's the man for that piece.

365
00:20:57,402 --> 00:20:58,165
Rym: Well, there's a lot.

366
00:20:58,386 --> 00:21:01,479
Rym: I see where you're going with this and there are a lot of reasons why that wouldn't really work.

367
00:21:02,203 --> 00:21:05,016
Rym: One it's kind of I've you ever written for Wikipedia.

368
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:14,587
Rym: Yeah Well, if you write on similar articles a lot, you know Every other's an article and then every article has a talk page associated with it Mm-hmm and that's where the authors all talk to each other.

369
00:21:14,788 --> 00:21:31,018
Rym: Yep, and I found through all my editing that most pages Have a small group of people who have just come to be in charge of that page Unofficially and they always watch it and they add it and they talk about it constantly And every page seems to have this sort of organization on its own ad hoc.

370
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:39,205
Rym: Yep And I don't know if I'd like the idea of making anything like that official because the main thing about Wikipedia Is that it's really just any.

371
00:21:39,246 --> 00:21:43,419
Rym: Joe Schmoe just edits it whenever he wants without even like wondering or thinking about it.

372
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:48,415
Scott: Well see what this with the idea that I have is you would still have any.

373
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:49,759
Scott: Joe Schmoe edits it, right?

374
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:53,833
Scott: But then it would be sort of like the like.

375
00:21:53,873 --> 00:22:02,959
Scott: there would be drafts and revisions So you just go in and edit the current working draft whenever you want it And then the guy who's in charge of that page would do you know would say?

376
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:09,140
Scott: Ah, and then you would write it in a way that is written properly and not just people hacking sentences into each other.

377
00:22:09,481 --> 00:22:10,324
Rym: No that that you know.

378
00:22:10,525 --> 00:22:10,946
Rym: see they've.

379
00:22:11,086 --> 00:22:17,835
Rym: they've considered that a lot and I see that same idea proposed on talk pages Constantly and even the high of Wikipedia.

380
00:22:17,855 --> 00:22:18,580
Rym: people have a lot.

381
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:23,338
Rym: I mean, I don't remember all their reasons, but they talked about a very specifically like it's a bad idea.

382
00:22:23,378 --> 00:22:24,000
Rym: for these reasons.

383
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:29,360
Rym: They're like one to the rise tons of reasons and they've aided it to death and they decided it's just it's not gonna happen.

384
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:35,720
Scott: I think as long it cuz then Wikipedia would only have to monitor this one set of people who are in charge of pages.

385
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:38,768
Rym: You know see Wikipedia doesn't monitor anything really.

386
00:22:38,788 --> 00:22:40,793
Rym: they just watch for abuses that are obvious.

387
00:22:41,274 --> 00:22:47,440
Rym: like if the same IP address Reverts a page three times one the page immediately becomes protected.

388
00:22:47,581 --> 00:22:49,508
Rym: No one can screw with it until someone looks at it.

389
00:22:49,989 --> 00:22:55,079
Rym: and two it just automatically prevents that IP address from editing anymore And all sorts of protections like that.

390
00:22:56,345 --> 00:23:04,015
Rym: And I've noticed that most Errors like this like even these Congress things get noticed almost immediately by just people reading Wikipedia and fixed.

391
00:23:04,757 --> 00:23:27,647
Rym: and whenever there's a war You know when someone makes an edit and someone else edits back and someone else edits back It seems that people notice that right away there are flags that it'll automatically flag an article that this article is being fought over and then it comes to the attention of the People who are a couple of steps up from me in terms of writing for Wikipedia Who really care about it a lot and they'll swoop down and fix it and set it straight And it all just seems to work out.

392
00:23:27,727 --> 00:23:30,399
Rym: I've never run into a page that was broken beyond repair.

393
00:23:31,301 --> 00:23:36,167
Scott: I've run into some pages that are pretty scary or Pages who are like the worst.

394
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:42,488
Scott: what's worse than something that's broken is when someone comes in and writes a page That's like a sentence and that's it.

395
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:45,640
Scott: and it's like you didn't even put any effort into that at all.

396
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,685
Scott: Why it's like God.

397
00:23:46,705 --> 00:23:47,690
Rym: you know what they do.

398
00:23:48,152 --> 00:23:49,740
Rym: pages like that are still marked as stubs.

399
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:52,572
Scott: No no no no no no no like.

400
00:23:53,155 --> 00:23:56,179
Scott: it's actually an article But it's it's barely even anything.

401
00:23:56,441 --> 00:24:05,602
Rym: And you know what when that happens as soon as someone finds that article and sees that there's almost nothing in it They mark it as a stub even though there's content there Mm-hmm.

402
00:24:05,762 --> 00:24:08,412
Rym: so it'll have the stub thing at the top and then whatever was already written.

403
00:24:09,235 --> 00:24:13,990
Rym: or if an article is poorly written Though it'll be flagged as warning this article is poorly written.

404
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,234
Rym: We're looking for people to edit it.

405
00:24:15,294 --> 00:24:16,116
Scott: see but who's doing this?

406
00:24:16,136 --> 00:24:17,119
Scott: flagging anyone?

407
00:24:18,528 --> 00:24:19,299
Scott: I don't see any of that.

408
00:24:19,702 --> 00:24:29,940
Rym: I see it often in fact many of the pages I edit since I tend to edit Various pseudoscience things where there are a lot of crackpots out there who are trying to edit back the pages get these flags all the time

409
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:31,502
Scott: Mm-hmm

410
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:48,433
Rym: like if you if a page is recommended for deletion It'll be shown that this page is recommended for deletion discuss And then people can eventually come to a consensus and then it'll be it of a permanent flag saying on such-and-such date This article was put up for deletion and deletion was voted against.

411
00:24:48,994 --> 00:24:50,579
Rym: so people don't bring it up again stuff like that.

412
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:58,090
Scott: Yeah, Wikipedia I still say was more useful like two years ago and when Before all the crazies in the world started messing with it.

413
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,053
Rym: see I have.

414
00:24:59,294 --> 00:25:03,969
Rym: I have not found any major Inaccuracies in Wikipedia in my recent reading at all.

415
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:05,955
Scott: It's not so much inaccuracies.

416
00:25:06,096 --> 00:25:10,509
Scott: It's it's like Because things are being fought over and whatnot.

417
00:25:10,589 --> 00:25:12,094
Rym: not much is being fought over.

418
00:25:12,114 --> 00:25:18,171
Rym: a very surprisingly small Amount of Wikipedia is subject to any excessive abuse.

419
00:25:18,672 --> 00:25:21,360
Scott: Yeah, but that's because that's the flagged part.

420
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,285
Scott: That's what you can count.

421
00:25:22,586 --> 00:25:23,129
Scott: the rest of it.

422
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:25,300
Scott: No one's paying attention to because it's not controversial.

423
00:25:25,823 --> 00:25:28,777
Scott: But the stuff that's not you know right there that just no one notices.

424
00:25:28,797 --> 00:25:30,888
Rym: because yeah And you know what people eventually notice it.

425
00:25:30,908 --> 00:25:34,326
Rym: because honestly part of what I do is when I'm bored I'll just randomly.

426
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:36,979
Rym: I'll just go to random Wikipedia pages and give them a quick once-over.

427
00:25:37,646 --> 00:25:38,680
Rym: I'll just fix a little grammar.

428
00:25:40,561 --> 00:25:44,980
Scott: The worst though is the stuff where you you have no way of knowing whether it's right or wrong.

429
00:25:45,121 --> 00:25:45,544
Rym: You know what?

430
00:25:45,846 --> 00:25:50,510
Rym: if you have no way of knowing whether it's right or wrong Then that's not the kind of thing you look up on Wikipedia.

431
00:25:50,871 --> 00:25:52,517
Scott: Wikipedia, but that's the but.

432
00:25:52,538 --> 00:25:53,180
Scott: then what's the point?

433
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,428
Scott: The point is to find out stuff.

434
00:25:54,468 --> 00:25:56,140
Scott: I don't know not to go find stuff.

435
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,389
Scott: I do know if I do know it.

436
00:25:57,409 --> 00:26:04,019
Rym: I don't need to look it up on Wikipedia Yeah, but if you're a hundred percent ignorant on a topic, you're probably want to gonna want to do some more.

437
00:26:04,872 --> 00:26:10,039
Scott: Of course Verifiable research of course, but then you know then what's the use of Wikipedia then?

438
00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:17,702
Rym: well You know what the use of Wikipedia is that despite all this I have never had a problem with the accuracy of the information I've sought Ever.

439
00:26:17,903 --> 00:26:22,455
Rym: I have never once run into a problem with using Wikipedia for research.

440
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,691
Scott: I Haven't had any specific problems, but it's like sometimes I'll go to look there, and it's just.

441
00:26:29,771 --> 00:26:30,960
Scott: it's just not helpful at all.

442
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:36,080
Scott: I haven't had like a problem where oh, I went to a page, and it was full of crap.

443
00:26:36,522 --> 00:26:38,008
Scott: You know the word fuck a hundred times.

444
00:26:38,068 --> 00:26:40,720
Rym: What have you been searching for in Wikipedia that you have all this trouble?

445
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:42,104
Scott: I don't know.

446
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:43,351
Scott: I don't remember last time.

447
00:26:43,371 --> 00:26:45,160
Scott: I went there was like a few days ago, but okay.

448
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,005
Rym: And what did you look for?

449
00:26:46,025 --> 00:26:46,951
Rym: I don't remember.

450
00:26:47,132 --> 00:26:48,520
Rym: so you're saying there's these problems?

451
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,638
Scott: Yeah, I remember going there for like three different things ending up with like just useless empty page.

452
00:26:53,658 --> 00:26:55,043
Rym: one things I don't remember.

453
00:26:55,084 --> 00:26:55,606
Scott: What do you want?

454
00:26:55,767 --> 00:26:56,972
Scott: me think I am like a freaking.

455
00:26:57,354 --> 00:26:58,459
Rym: uh so you've got.

456
00:26:58,499 --> 00:27:00,380
Rym: no Don't even have anecdotal evidence.

457
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,805
Rym: You're just saying stuff just cuz.

458
00:27:01,845 --> 00:27:03,190
Scott: I don't remember what it was.

459
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:05,437
Scott: just cuz I don't remember what I was searching for.

460
00:27:05,518 --> 00:27:10,600
Scott: doesn't mean That my memory of the fact that I searched and what the result was is invalid?

461
00:27:11,362 --> 00:27:12,025
Rym: It might be cuz.

462
00:27:12,045 --> 00:27:18,739
Rym: I'm curious as to whether you actually had a problem or what articles you saw that for whatever reason I mean why were these articles bad?

463
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:22,820
Scott: They were just like one sentence, and it was completely useless.

464
00:27:23,504 --> 00:27:24,571
Rym: What were you searching for?

465
00:27:24,611 --> 00:27:25,115
Rym: and if it was just?

466
00:27:25,135 --> 00:27:25,880
Rym: I don't remember.

467
00:27:26,301 --> 00:27:27,606
Scott: I just remember what there is.

468
00:27:27,907 --> 00:27:29,473
Scott: the result was like and that it was.

469
00:27:29,493 --> 00:27:34,132
Rym: you're saying that you found it on a whole article Not marked as a stub a separate article.

470
00:27:34,434 --> 00:27:35,599
Rym: that was just a sentence.

471
00:27:36,222 --> 00:27:38,833
Rym: Yeah, show me an example of this and maybe we'll talk.

472
00:27:39,194 --> 00:27:40,600
Rym: did you look on the discussion page?

473
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,484
Rym: Maybe they were.

474
00:27:41,604 --> 00:27:47,853
Rym: they just deleted it because they were rewriting something Whenever someone person there wasn't any little notices at the top or anything.

475
00:27:48,295 --> 00:27:48,616
Rym: all right.

476
00:27:48,656 --> 00:27:49,820
Rym: Did you look at the talk page?

477
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,820
Scott: No, I never look at the talk page the talk page.

478
00:27:51,880 --> 00:28:05,098
Rym: We always have to look because whenever an article is being edited heavily What they'll do is they'll copy well They'll cut and paste all the stuff out of the article into the talk page and take it off of the article And then they'll edit it there, and then they'll put it back when it's readable or good.

479
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:10,380
Rym: Hmm, so maybe you just found pages that were in transition and weren't flagged yet.

480
00:28:10,621 --> 00:28:11,605
Scott: But see if things are moving.

481
00:28:11,786 --> 00:28:18,747
Scott: see that's also annoying because if things are moving around all the time Then it's you know it's like I have no trouble.

482
00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:19,995
Rym: things are moving around.

483
00:28:20,015 --> 00:28:23,520
Scott: you look in the talk page And you see I have to go and look in the stupid talk page.

484
00:28:23,741 --> 00:28:25,868
Rym: Yeah, you see research isn't easy.

485
00:28:26,028 --> 00:28:31,139
Rym: it never has been and it never will be because you can't trust many sources And you have to back things up constantly.

486
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,046
Rym: Wikipedia is the same way.

487
00:28:33,388 --> 00:28:38,973
Rym: if you want to use Wikipedia for more than just a cursory Glance of some information you have to look at the talk page.

488
00:28:38,993 --> 00:28:40,640
Rym: you have to look at who's been editing the article.

489
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:48,527
Rym: You have to look at what's going on And you have to think to yourself whether or not this article seems legitimate and possibly do a little bit of side research to Make sure that it is in fact.

490
00:28:48,567 --> 00:28:50,360
Scott: I don't use Wikipedia for anything serious.

491
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,087
Scott: I use use it if there's like a fact or two.

492
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:56,426
Scott: I want to know you know and if there's no facts there whatsoever It's like.

493
00:28:57,032 --> 00:28:58,060
Scott: it's just not worth the effort.

494
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,586
Scott: You know it's like I want.

495
00:28:59,646 --> 00:29:00,409
Scott: it's the point isn't?

496
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,232
Scott: I want to.

497
00:29:01,775 --> 00:29:06,162
Scott: if I'm doing real research I'm going to go to the library or Realize that.

498
00:29:06,182 --> 00:29:14,069
Rym: the other point is if you search for something on Wikipedia, and there's no information there about it Then that's your problem not Wikipedia's.

499
00:29:14,349 --> 00:29:16,937
Rym: you should step up and write the article do the research and write it.

500
00:29:17,117 --> 00:29:21,279
Scott: you know if I'm Looking for something that's because I don't know it.

501
00:29:21,481 --> 00:29:23,700
Scott: So I'm not really the person to write the article on it.

502
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:29,680
Rym: Yeah, so if you don't find the answer on Wikipedia But you still want to find the answer and you eventually do you should go back and put it in Wikipedia.

503
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,332
Scott: The thing is if I if I really want to know the answer.

504
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:33,940
Scott: I'm not going to be looking on Wikipedia.

505
00:29:34,062 --> 00:29:35,319
Scott: I'm going to be reading a book on it.

506
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:39,860
Scott: I look on Wikipedia when I'd like to know the answer and it's not really worth that much to me.

507
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,064
Scott: But Wikipedia is really easy.

508
00:29:41,084 --> 00:29:45,058
Rym: it takes a second, but you realize that there was a time when there was nothing on Wikipedia.

509
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:48,032
Rym: now There's more, but if you find something that isn't there.

510
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:49,600
Rym: That's not a problem.

511
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,940
Rym: Wikipedia is not perfect, and it doesn't have all the information in the world in it.

512
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,010
Rym: There's no way it can ever have all the information in the world.

513
00:29:56,311 --> 00:29:58,759
Rym: there will always be something you can search for that won't be on Wikipedia.

514
00:29:59,984 --> 00:30:08,350
Rym: Yeah The point is most things are there most things people search for are there and Most things that people search for are there and fairly accurate and good.

515
00:30:09,172 --> 00:30:11,460
Scott: I still think it's getting more messed up over time.

516
00:30:12,765 --> 00:30:13,660
Rym: I'd say just the opposite.

517
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:20,140
Rym: I'd say the most as times gone on especially in the last six or seven months the quality of many articles has improved precipitously.

518
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:25,384
Scott: No, that's not what I see because I remember articles that you're reading I don't even know.

519
00:30:25,404 --> 00:30:26,086
Scott: I remember because

520
00:30:26,106 --> 00:30:44,230
Rym: you realize I make it a point if I read one Wikipedia article every single day Just as part of my editing and I've I can think of one or two articles in the past several months that had any Major problems with them or any sort of bad grammar beyond just things that I wouldn't expect people to worry about.

521
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:49,434
Scott: I Remember like in my late college years Wikipedia was like amazing and everything on there was great.

522
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:53,686
Scott: and lately all there is is you know People yelling about it, and what do you mean?

523
00:30:53,706 --> 00:30:54,648
Rym: Where are these people yelling?

524
00:30:54,668 --> 00:30:55,390
Rym: What are you talking about?

525
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,240
Scott: Isn't that just the story that we were talking about?

526
00:30:59,542 --> 00:31:03,924
Rym: Some people some people were defacing some pages and Wikipedia blocked all.

527
00:31:03,965 --> 00:31:07,620
Scott: there was a story a couple weeks ago where another guy was defacing a page about himself.

528
00:31:07,861 --> 00:31:19,960
Scott: There was one man, and there were pseudo science people messing with pages and putting lies on them And there are culties going in there religious people going in there And you realize that's a small fraction of the total of Wikipedia.

529
00:31:20,783 --> 00:31:24,597
Rym: And there there are thousands and thousands thousands of articles that aren't contested at all.

530
00:31:24,637 --> 00:31:33,600
Rym: like the other day I was reading out of the article on rabbits Just rabbits the animal and I was reading the article and going through it and the talk page had almost nothing in it.

531
00:31:33,841 --> 00:31:35,570
Rym: There was nothing controversial about rabbits.

532
00:31:36,053 --> 00:31:37,380
Rym: No one was fighting about rabbits.

533
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:38,749
Rym: No one is even defacing rabbits.

534
00:31:38,789 --> 00:31:40,360
Rym: It was just a useful article on rabbits.

535
00:31:40,682 --> 00:31:41,184
Scott: How do you know?

536
00:31:41,245 --> 00:31:42,150
Scott: but see here's the thing.

537
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:44,080
Scott: there's no way to verify what you know?

538
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:51,494
Scott: I could have gone into the rabbit page and written something like see there I could have made up a species of rabbit photoshopped a picture of it put it on.

539
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:58,932
Scott: there wrote that that rabbit eats I don't know cats and There would be no talk or discussion on it because no one cares about rabbit.

540
00:31:58,952 --> 00:32:02,768
Rym: see there probably would be because that thing that sort Of thing does happen from time to time.

541
00:32:02,809 --> 00:32:04,157
Rym: We're a completely benign article.

542
00:32:04,177 --> 00:32:16,760
Rym: some Article was recently but there was one where someone just added something crazy to it just randomly and they just slipped it in and it Looked legitimate, but people reading the article picked up on it immediately and it was a fairly obscure article.

543
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,933
Rym: I'll try to dig it up and I'll post it if I find the link.

544
00:32:18,953 --> 00:32:23,712
Scott: I Know what losers are out there going around Wikipedia looking for stuff like that.

545
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,720
Scott: I am no way to go.

546
00:32:26,682 --> 00:32:29,358
Rym: Every day I read at least one article and then I edit it if necessary.

547
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:32,920
Scott: Yeah, cuz you know about whatever you're reading there.

548
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,259
Rym: Well, the thing is I generally have a sense of it's fair.

549
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,810
Rym: It's usually fairly obvious because I'm fairly knowledgeable about a lot of topics.

550
00:32:39,191 --> 00:32:44,059
Rym: if something is BS or it'll set off the wait a minute Sense and I look it up further.

551
00:32:44,441 --> 00:32:45,867
Scott: Well, I have that I can do that too.

552
00:32:45,968 --> 00:32:49,000
Scott: But I mean, you know, if I'm not the authority on something, what's my business?

553
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:49,682
Rym: I mean, what's your point?

554
00:32:49,703 --> 00:32:53,540
Rym: You're really knocking Wikipedia, but I think Wikipedia does is very good at what it does.

555
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,106
Scott: It's less useful than it used to be.

556
00:32:55,528 --> 00:32:57,436
Rym: I don't I say just the opposite.

557
00:32:57,496 --> 00:33:00,550
Rym: the more I use Wikipedia I think it's improving greatly in recent months.

558
00:33:00,992 --> 00:33:02,700
Scott: Well, that's not been my experience.

559
00:33:02,841 --> 00:33:10,307
Scott: My experience is you know a couple years ago whenever I look something up I would always find something great and lately whenever I look something up I always been looking up to.

560
00:33:10,327 --> 00:33:12,960
Scott: I defy you in the next just cuz I don't remember what I've been looking up.

561
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,489
Rym: I really don't believe you because you have nothing.

562
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:18,540
Scott: Yeah, cuz I'm just making it up that you know, I wouldn't put it past you.

563
00:33:18,901 --> 00:33:19,523
Scott: Yeah, okay.

564
00:33:19,784 --> 00:33:21,209
Scott: I mean really you're just making it up.

565
00:33:22,032 --> 00:33:24,260
Rym: I look at the Wikipedia article on rabbits, which I just read.

566
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,164
Rym: It was fantastic.

567
00:33:25,405 --> 00:33:26,209
Rym: Look at the talk page.

568
00:33:26,611 --> 00:33:30,913
Rym: Look at the Wikipedia article on indigo children Which I just edited fairly heavily not too long ago.

569
00:33:30,933 --> 00:33:31,777
Rym: It's fine.

570
00:33:32,421 --> 00:33:33,960
Rym: No one's even tried to revert the chain.

571
00:33:34,301 --> 00:33:39,519
Rym: Someone tried to revert the changes I put in once and someone else who's smart just fixed it and there hasn't been a problem since.

572
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,606
Rym: hmm Recently, I read one on the Gulf War.

573
00:33:43,948 --> 00:33:47,200
Rym: the Wikipedia article on the original Gulf War is extremely accurate and well done.

574
00:33:47,882 --> 00:33:49,469
Scott: Yeah, cuz you're an expert in the Gulf War.

575
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:52,040
Rym: I know enough about it to know if an article is accurate or not.

576
00:33:52,666 --> 00:33:54,502
Scott: You might know some parts are accurate but you don't know.

577
00:33:54,703 --> 00:34:03,507
Rym: plus you realize everything in any Wikipedia article has to be backed up by a citation and a link to that citation and It's very easy to look at the citations.

578
00:34:03,788 --> 00:34:04,931
Rym: See if those are legitimate.

579
00:34:05,132 --> 00:34:06,116
Rym: See if they actually back up.

580
00:34:06,196 --> 00:34:07,360
Scott: Not everything is cited.

581
00:34:09,445 --> 00:34:13,940
Rym: If there's something that's unsighted It Wikipedia policy it either has to be cited or deleted.

582
00:34:14,442 --> 00:34:26,159
Rym: In fact, there's a specific rule against original research if there is no site or if anything's original It cannot be on Wikipedia and it will be deleted as per Wikipedia's policy if something isn't cited there.

583
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,224
Scott: Where are these citations?

584
00:34:27,244 --> 00:34:37,500
Scott: because sometimes I'll see like at the bottom of the page some links or you know, some bibliography Yeah, but there aren't like, you know little footnotes and citations in every single sentence on many many articles.

585
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,579
Rym: There are numerous numerous numerous citations dozens and dozens.

586
00:34:41,382 --> 00:34:45,060
Scott: I don't see him and I don't see every single fact and every single paragraph being cited.

587
00:34:45,241 --> 00:34:51,129
Rym: You do realize that if there's a site at the end of a paragraph Oftentimes that site relates to the entire paragraph.

588
00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:51,429
Scott: Yes.

589
00:34:51,551 --> 00:34:54,420
Scott: I know this but many many paragraphs just don't have anything.

590
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,005
Scott: It's just paragraphs of information.

591
00:34:56,165 --> 00:34:57,609
Rym: Um, that's not been my experience.

592
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:01,160
Rym: I found that almost everything I read on Wikipedia is actually fairly well cited.

593
00:35:02,162 --> 00:35:04,236
Scott: I don't even know where the citations are half the time.

594
00:35:04,277 --> 00:35:07,124
Scott: They're just like bottom under Citations.

595
00:35:07,265 --> 00:35:10,839
Scott: Yeah, a lot of times will be this giant article and at the bottom They'll be like two things.

596
00:35:11,321 --> 00:35:17,260
Rym: Um, if that's true point them out to me and I'll fix them or I'll delete them because that's the exception to the rule.

597
00:35:18,301 --> 00:35:18,783
Scott: I don't know.

598
00:35:18,884 --> 00:35:19,687
Scott: It's not what I see.

599
00:35:19,787 --> 00:35:20,932
Rym: then didn't point it out to me.

600
00:35:21,153 --> 00:35:21,534
Rym: Show me.

601
00:35:21,916 --> 00:35:22,840
Scott: Why do I have to show you?

602
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,027
Scott: Why don't you show me all the the whatevers?

603
00:35:25,148 --> 00:35:28,420
Rym: All right, look at all the ones I just described - - that's a great.

604
00:35:28,541 --> 00:35:30,051
Scott: You know sample size there.

605
00:35:30,071 --> 00:35:34,195
Rym: All right, let's see I read one on the Crimean War which I actually know quite a bit about.

606
00:35:34,256 --> 00:35:35,060
Rym: it was very well done.

607
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,699
Rym: It was a little short, but it was about what you get from high school history book.

608
00:35:38,922 --> 00:35:45,552
Rym: I read one recently on the Articles of Confederation From you know, but they document the US used before the Constitution.

609
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,680
Rym: It was actually extremely well written and accurate.

610
00:35:48,802 --> 00:35:50,592
Rym: I read one on the Civil War not too long ago.

611
00:35:50,874 --> 00:35:54,400
Scott: That one was fairly well cited But you're not an expert in any of those things.

612
00:35:54,520 --> 00:36:08,889
Rym: Actually, I know I'm not an expert but I know a lot about the Civil War because my grandfather is is very I wouldn't say Nutty, but he's extremely interested in and well versed in the American Civil War Partly because his family's from Tennessee and he's just.

613
00:36:09,351 --> 00:36:10,958
Rym: he's really big on American history like that.

614
00:36:12,741 --> 00:36:16,475
Scott: See your grandpa would be able to say whether it is that doesn't say anything about you.

615
00:36:16,495 --> 00:36:18,583
Scott: I Mean, I could.

616
00:36:18,623 --> 00:36:22,216
Rym: I wasn't using these as examples of oh I read this article and it's perfect as in.

617
00:36:22,537 --> 00:36:24,464
Rym: I'm using them as examples Of oh, I read this article.

618
00:36:24,785 --> 00:36:26,692
Rym: It was really good and here.

619
00:36:26,712 --> 00:36:28,800
Scott: Oh, look, here's the one about rabbits.

620
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:32,320
Scott: Let's see where I can find a citation.

621
00:36:33,302 --> 00:36:34,769
Scott: No, there aren't any citations yet.

622
00:36:35,392 --> 00:36:36,980
Scott: No, there's still no citations.

623
00:36:38,323 --> 00:36:41,400
Scott: Still no citations Still none.

624
00:36:42,204 --> 00:36:48,210
Scott: There are three links there in the middle of the page Under the human relationships with rabbits.

625
00:36:48,351 --> 00:36:52,621
Scott: There's three links at the bottom of it Uh-huh.

626
00:36:53,904 --> 00:36:54,787
Scott: I don't see any footnotes.

627
00:36:54,847 --> 00:36:56,150
Scott: I don't see any citations.

628
00:36:56,691 --> 00:36:56,932
Scott: Nothing.

629
00:36:56,952 --> 00:36:57,173
Scott: Nothing.

630
00:36:57,213 --> 00:36:57,774
Scott: Nothing.

631
00:36:58,636 --> 00:36:58,877
Scott: Nothing.

632
00:36:58,897 --> 00:36:59,137
Scott: Nothing.

633
00:36:59,178 --> 00:36:59,418
Scott: Nothing.

634
00:36:59,438 --> 00:36:59,879
Scott: Nothing.

635
00:37:01,361 --> 00:37:07,099
Scott: They're inter Wikipedia links and at the bottom of the page, there are two external links and three see.

636
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:15,925
Scott: also I don't see any citations as in this book this page or this scientific Journal entry this anything.

637
00:37:16,648 --> 00:37:21,167
Scott: so according to you we should delete most of this but also according to you It's well-written.

638
00:37:21,309 --> 00:37:22,080
Scott: Where are the citations?

639
00:37:22,781 --> 00:37:25,860
Rym: Most of that information comes from the links at the bottom.

640
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,595
Rym: They don't didn't cite everything because a lot of the information but it's not in both cited.

641
00:37:29,856 --> 00:37:35,040
Scott: a citation means Parentheses with telling me where that information comes from.

642
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:39,760
Rym: How do I know which of these paragraphs of information you realize comes from which link you realize that?

643
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:43,840
Rym: Citation is not a formal word and that there are many different kinds of citation.

644
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:51,113
Rym: There's MLA citation, which is a very specific in exactly what the formatting of the site It also has to do with what information you include in the citation.

645
00:37:51,635 --> 00:37:53,162
Rym: There's a Citation.

646
00:37:53,202 --> 00:37:56,393
Scott: means you say which information came from which source.

647
00:37:56,795 --> 00:37:59,066
Scott: all this says is no Citation.

648
00:37:59,086 --> 00:38:00,879
Rym: just means you say where the information came from.

649
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,928
Rym: That could be a very vague broad fantasy.

650
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:08,492
Scott: which information came from where you can't just say yeah You call this information came from either here or here.

651
00:38:08,532 --> 00:38:09,376
Scott: That's not citing.

652
00:38:09,477 --> 00:38:09,859
Rym: Why not?

653
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:14,157
Rym: That's you may not consider that citing but the definition of citation is fairly broad.

654
00:38:14,177 --> 00:38:20,429
Rym: All right Well, let's look at this link rabbit org, which is the primary Cited reference for the Wikipedia article.

655
00:38:21,011 --> 00:38:26,779
Rym: it contains in extreme detail everything included in the Wikipedia article and more.

656
00:38:27,981 --> 00:38:29,989
Scott: So why even bother having the Wikipedia article?

657
00:38:30,471 --> 00:38:34,690
Rym: Wikipedia article is just a Useful reference and it points you in the right direction.

658
00:38:35,031 --> 00:38:39,520
Rym: if you want more than what's on the Wikipedia article Then you can follow the links for the more exact information.

659
00:38:39,921 --> 00:38:43,294
Scott: See now, how do I know which information on this rabbit page came from?

660
00:38:43,314 --> 00:38:43,675
Scott: which of those?

661
00:38:43,695 --> 00:38:44,077
Scott: what?

662
00:38:44,277 --> 00:38:44,880
Rym: if you don't know?

663
00:38:45,300 --> 00:39:06,560
Scott: Then just don't use Wikipedia so you may have noticed around various websites on the internet is a lot of supposed pictures of what the User interface on the revolution is going to look like the virtual console or whatever you want to call it.

664
00:39:07,823 --> 00:39:12,919
Scott: pretty much all of them are fake and In fact, the one I've linked to is fake confirmed.

665
00:39:14,001 --> 00:39:23,093
Scott: But the point is is that people are talking like ah is Nintendo Just making a whole bunch of these and flooding the internet with them to create some hype.

666
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:25,580
Scott: Are they doing it to?

667
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,967
Scott: You know get people confused.

668
00:39:28,068 --> 00:39:30,740
Scott: So if the real one ever gets out there people won't believe it.

669
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:35,512
Scott: Or is this some guy doing it on purpose to be silly?

670
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,479
Scott: or you know, there's all kinds of stuff.

671
00:39:38,322 --> 00:39:40,911
Rym: Yeah, it's hard to say but all the ideas we see.

672
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:41,091
Rym: one.

673
00:39:41,111 --> 00:39:42,516
Rym: These photoshops are really well done.

674
00:39:42,636 --> 00:39:43,579
Scott: They're really well done.

675
00:39:44,062 --> 00:39:49,367
Rym: I mean we look at this one like they even get it where you see like the Projected image on the guy standing in front of the screen.

676
00:39:49,588 --> 00:39:50,871
Scott: Yeah, it's really good.

677
00:39:51,734 --> 00:39:59,640
Rym: and two all these things are kind of badass Like they're all products that ooh or ideas that ooh, they make me get all the Twitter about Nintendo.

678
00:40:00,581 --> 00:40:07,679
Scott: Yeah, you know and it's the one that that looked the most believable to me was the one that looked a lot like the DS interface.

679
00:40:08,527 --> 00:40:16,440
Scott: but I have a feeling that the Revolution interface is going to utilize the revolution controller in some way like aiming and shooting or some such like that.

680
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,415
Scott: Yeah, you know perhaps something 3d could be done with the new controller.

681
00:40:20,476 --> 00:40:21,520
Scott: That would be about mad cool.

682
00:40:22,644 --> 00:40:24,759
Scott: You know cuz 3d interfaces right now all suck.

683
00:40:25,884 --> 00:40:26,451
Rym: Yeah, pretty much.

684
00:40:27,928 --> 00:40:34,513
Rym: Though for me over the weekend I had the pleasure of seeing a movie that not many people in the world have seen.

685
00:40:35,215 --> 00:40:37,260
Rym: it's it was never released ever.

686
00:40:37,884 --> 00:40:39,820
Rym: It's had a few special screenings.

687
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:43,869
Rym: In 1984 it was shown in Seattle for four days.

688
00:40:44,351 --> 00:40:47,040
Rym: It was shown one day in New York City a few years ago.

689
00:40:47,461 --> 00:40:53,540
Rym: It was shown in Rochester, New York over this past weekend once and the movie is called nothing lasts forever.

690
00:40:54,841 --> 00:41:02,424
Rym: It was basically, you know Saturday Night Live like old Saturday Night Live back when like John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd All them were on it.

691
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:04,734
Scott: So not super old just semi old.

692
00:41:04,774 --> 00:41:06,280
Rym: Yeah, like the golden age.

693
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:19,439
Rym: Well part of it is that back then the original concept for SNL included having short films In every episode like there'd be the musical act and the comedy bits and then short film Mm-hmm, and there was this guy.

694
00:41:20,202 --> 00:41:27,287
Rym: His name was Tom Schiller and he made a bunch of these movies and anyone who's old enough to remember the old SNL I remembers these movies.

695
00:41:27,328 --> 00:41:29,260
Rym: They're just little shorts and they're often hilarious.

696
00:41:30,361 --> 00:41:31,806
Rym: One was kind of scary and prophetic.

697
00:41:31,886 --> 00:41:46,304
Rym: It showed all the characters from SNL dead except John Belushi And he was walking over all their graves like yeah Fellow this one died of this and blah blah blah and then a lot of them ended up actually dying early Including John Belushi,

698
00:41:46,445 --> 00:41:46,745
Scott: yeah,

699
00:41:47,327 --> 00:41:53,200
Rym: but this movie has all those people in it like every big name for I mean Bill Murray Dan Aykroyd.

700
00:41:54,161 --> 00:41:58,717
Rym: John Belushi was gonna be in it, but he actually died right before Bill Murray.

701
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:00,469
Scott: You said him.

702
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:07,807
Rym: Yeah, I said him But I really can't describe this movie other than that.

703
00:42:07,847 --> 00:42:09,590
Rym: it was odd and hilarious.

704
00:42:11,191 --> 00:42:15,950
Scott: It's hard to not be hilarious with that kind of lineup, I mean I just to give a small sampling.

705
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,599
Rym: I mean, there's a transit strike, right?

706
00:42:19,001 --> 00:42:21,530
Rym: So the New York Port Authority takes over Manhattan.

707
00:42:23,331 --> 00:42:28,373
Rym: Okay, yeah, and then they go to the moon on a bus and There's the already bus.

708
00:42:29,014 --> 00:42:34,890
Rym: No, but then there's these bums that are living under the city and they're actually the secret masters of the universe.

709
00:42:36,439 --> 00:42:41,110
Rym: All right And Bill Murray plays this guy and he's odd.

710
00:42:42,173 --> 00:42:43,810
Rym: I'm really not sure how to describe it at all.

711
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:44,954
Rym: I could the movies.

712
00:42:44,994 --> 00:42:47,402
Scott: it is a reason that no one's seen it and no one wants to see it.

713
00:42:47,683 --> 00:42:48,606
Rym: It's really good.

714
00:42:48,707 --> 00:42:58,060
Rym: It's hilarious and it wasn't released only because Warner Brothers didn't like it and There's a lot of like stock footage used in it.

715
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,209
Rym: So they're copyright issues with actually releasing it.

716
00:43:00,892 --> 00:43:08,240
Rym: But if you have one if any of you out there have a copy of this movie That isn't that one screener bootleg that's going around.

717
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,063
Rym: that's unwatchable.

718
00:43:09,685 --> 00:43:10,909
Rym: I'll probably pay good money for it.

719
00:43:11,872 --> 00:43:13,436
Scott: I'm sure there has to be a way.

720
00:43:13,938 --> 00:43:18,792
Rym: there's a horrible broken screener that you can buy and it's just like Unwatchable.

721
00:43:19,374 --> 00:43:21,581
Rym: it was aired once on Australian television.

722
00:43:22,304 --> 00:43:24,090
Rym: It was aired once on German television.

723
00:43:24,914 --> 00:43:27,044
Scott: I'm sure we can get it up from Australian television.

724
00:43:27,064 --> 00:43:28,330
Rym: I don't know if anyone taped it.

725
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:29,396
Rym: I don't think it was ever aired again.

726
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,065
Scott: There's got to be something.

727
00:43:31,085 --> 00:43:31,810
Scott: there can't be Epps.

728
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:32,433
Scott: I mean you.

729
00:43:32,554 --> 00:43:34,063
Scott: you just watched it the other day, right?

730
00:43:34,083 --> 00:43:34,868
Scott: You just saw it, right?

731
00:43:35,049 --> 00:43:36,782
Scott: Yeah The means is a film that exists.

732
00:43:36,843 --> 00:43:37,589
Rym: Oh, yeah, there's film.

733
00:43:38,172 --> 00:43:41,890
Rym: It has to be a narrow transfer of some sort somewhere something.

734
00:43:42,832 --> 00:43:46,609
Scott: It might require great pizza of Lupin, but there's a way to get this movie and watch it.

735
00:43:47,171 --> 00:43:52,090
Rym: Yeah, so if anyone out there has seen this movie one, I'd love to get some audio feedback from you.

736
00:43:52,210 --> 00:44:00,797
Rym: Maybe you can describe the movie in a more coherent way than I am able to - if you find the movie I'm prepared to pay you handsomely for it.

737
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,545
Scott: It's just bit torn it.

738
00:44:02,645 --> 00:44:03,087
Scott: Come on.

739
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:07,250
Rym: Yeah If you find it on bit torn God.

740
00:44:07,852 --> 00:44:17,968
Rym: Yeah, this movie just fantastic and it's weird and it's kind of a backhanded thing of the day because while one It's this awesome thing that I want you all to see there's almost no way for you to see it.

741
00:44:18,854 --> 00:44:20,224
Scott: Yeah, I really hate it.

742
00:44:20,265 --> 00:44:26,550
Rym: when things are Lost yeah, like all those episodes of Doctor Who that the BBC just destroyed and they're gone forever.

743
00:44:27,011 --> 00:44:28,736
Scott: Yeah, when things are gone forever it sucks.

744
00:44:28,756 --> 00:44:32,987
Scott: and that's why copyright sex because it makes things get lost forever.

745
00:44:33,007 --> 00:44:37,120
Scott: without copyright Nothing would ever get lost because some nothing that matters.

746
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,147
Scott: I'm not would make a billion copies of it.

747
00:44:39,167 --> 00:44:40,070
Scott: Hold on to it forever.

748
00:44:41,232 --> 00:44:42,964
Rym: Well things that didn't matter would get lost but there's cuz.

749
00:44:42,984 --> 00:44:43,770
Rym: no one would like them live.

750
00:44:43,831 --> 00:44:45,310
Scott: No one likes them deserve to get lost.

751
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:48,000
Rym: You can't find even one guy willing to hoard what you did.

752
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,730
Rym: It probably isn't worth knowing about a thousand years from now.

753
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:54,870
Scott: Yeah, seriously, there are people who collect like I don't know spoons.

754
00:44:55,732 --> 00:45:00,757
Scott: If there's a guy who's willing to hold on to a spoon and he's not willing as some there's no one willing to hold on To what you made?

755
00:45:01,242 --> 00:45:01,969
Scott: Wow, it sucks.

756
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:09,050
Scott: Wow, or it doesn't suck enough because if something really sucks people will hold on to it for its novelty like hard rock zombies.

757
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:10,505
Scott: Yeah like that.

758
00:45:11,261 --> 00:45:17,689
Rym: but Yeah, we're not gonna do our main bit today just because we yelled at each other for 45 minutes about other things.

00:45:17,729 --> 00:45:18,656
Scott: pretend That's the main bit.

760

763
00:45:36,945 --> 00:45:37,546

Rym: Yeah, and there's this big rigmarole.

770
00:46:03,191 --> 00:46:10,509
Rym: Lisa they had to lock the thread twice because people just were screaming about it and every forum where people find out about this is just going nuts.
