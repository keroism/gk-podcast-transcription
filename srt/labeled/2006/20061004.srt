00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,456
Rym: It's Wednesday October 4th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:17,600
Rym: tonight We have Emily on the show and we finally get around to talking about Scott Pilgrim.

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,885
Rym: Let's do this For some reason.

4
00:00:21,925 --> 00:00:22,769
Rym: Scott's tired.

5
00:00:22,809 --> 00:00:24,800
Rym: I'm not really sure why cuz he doesn't do much.

6
00:00:25,061 --> 00:00:30,592
Scott: I told you I woke up early right and you know sometimes in the middle of the night you wake up And then you go back to sleep right away, right?

7
00:00:30,672 --> 00:00:30,975
Scott: You know what?

8
00:00:30,995 --> 00:00:38,179
Rym: when that happens It's usually like one of those magic nights where you know maybe it's a six-hour night But it ends up feeling like you know a year or two.

9
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:40,440
Scott: No that that happens to me a lot.

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,260
Rym: You know you wake up, and then you fall asleep And then you wake up, and you feel like you slept all night, and it's been like ten minutes.

11
00:00:46,002 --> 00:00:53,360
Scott: Yeah, that happens to me a lot, but anyway this morning I woke up like an hour or so early and I woke up and my windows are wide open.

12
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:55,840
Scott: You know cuz I have my new furniture arrangement.

13
00:00:56,262 --> 00:01:00,840
Scott: So I'm looking out the window, and I see this fog and it's a crazy fog.

14
00:01:01,284 --> 00:01:02,680
Rym: Yeah, this is a new fit.

15
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:09,371
Rym: I mean we've lived here for long enough to have gone through all the seasons But we've never had a fog season before.

16
00:01:09,733 --> 00:01:11,540
Rym: I think there's an extra season in Beacon.

17
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:17,600
Scott: I think it goes spring winter summer fog fall yep, so you know there's a crazy fog.

18
00:01:17,983 --> 00:01:20,160
Scott: So I'm kind of tired and falling back to sleep.

19
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,160
Scott: But then I keep looking at this crazy fog, and I can't stop looking at it.

20
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,887
Scott: It's so crazy, and I'm like man.

21
00:01:25,907 --> 00:01:28,739
Scott: I hope that fog stays so I could drive in it.

22
00:01:29,021 --> 00:01:38,760
Rym: Yeah, you know what I did drive through it and It was really cool for about I don't know eight minutes Mm-hmm, and then it just made traffic go really slow.

23
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:45,905
Scott: Yeah, by the time I woke up and got in the car the fog wasn't as full as it was when I woke up You know earlier.

24
00:01:45,925 --> 00:01:56,080
Rym: yeah, see the thing is I got up early to go to work early So I could leave work early, but for various reasons there wasn't much work to do today, so getting there early served no purpose.

25
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,372
Rym: I Mean I got there early like I'll get some work done.

26
00:02:00,393 --> 00:02:05,140
Rym: There was nothing to do like damn it And I had stuff in the afternoon all canceled.

27
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:11,379
Rym: Yeah, I got a new project, and then the project was canceled before they finished giving it to me.

28
00:02:12,705 --> 00:02:27,459
Rym: So I thought all right fuck it I'm gonna play Defcon cuz I got a Windows computer here And I ran into the problem that apparently like five percent of people have Where if you have a certain sound card whatever that game just won't fucking work.

29
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,750
Scott: Why just disable the sound card in the bot the BIOS?

30
00:02:31,131 --> 00:02:32,636
Rym: I can't really do that.

31
00:02:32,716 --> 00:02:34,924
Scott: about the device manager I don't.

32
00:02:35,064 --> 00:02:35,325
Rym: well.

33
00:02:35,526 --> 00:02:37,533
Rym: I need the sound card for other work stuff.

34
00:02:37,954 --> 00:02:39,479
Scott: You need the sound card for your work.

35
00:02:39,862 --> 00:02:48,080
Rym: They're voice over IP crab and I mean I could but it would be such a job great at DirectX stuff.

36
00:02:48,503 --> 00:02:49,349
Rym: Everything's up-to-date.

37
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:57,749
Rym: a lot of people have this problem And it no one's really sure what causes it and all the workarounds work for some of the people But not other people, and it's just.

38
00:02:57,789 --> 00:02:58,232
Rym: it's annoying.

39
00:02:58,312 --> 00:02:59,680
Scott: it sounds like a crazy problem.

40
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,342
Scott: Well the thing is.

41
00:03:00,422 --> 00:03:05,840
Rym: apparently the other game Darwinia that they made has the exact same problem.

42
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:07,806
Scott: Then why didn't they fix it for Darwinian?

43
00:03:07,867 --> 00:03:14,908
Rym: probably because it mostly affects people who aren't gamers because I think the kind of hardware it Effects is hardware that gamers wouldn't willingly use.

44
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:20,565
Scott: but the point of their games is that they run on 600 megahertz CPUs with 128 Meg's.

45
00:03:20,585 --> 00:03:21,830
Scott: I don't know.

46
00:03:22,112 --> 00:03:24,060
Rym: all I know is I didn't get to play DEFCON at work.

47
00:03:24,402 --> 00:03:27,260
Rym: So I ended up not doing what you should have played my thing of the day.

48
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:33,340
Rym: Now you'd think gladiator gladiator gladiator that okay?

49
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,748
Rym: I could have done a lot for GeekNights.

50
00:03:34,768 --> 00:03:35,895
Rym: You know found some news.

51
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:47,970
Rym: no You know what a lot happened in the world today and Fuck all of it had anything to do with anime Or manga or comics or anything.

52
00:03:48,392 --> 00:03:49,596
Scott: yeah, that was really nothing.

53
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:50,439
Rym: so I was.

54
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:53,798
Rym: I thought Oh, I'll do a news about the fact that the Gitmo inmates are all fat.

55
00:03:54,883 --> 00:04:02,550
Rym: And while that's funny and all and I could make a lot of jokes there I'm gonna save that for not a Wednesday.

56
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:11,571
Rym: instead my news is that this weekend October 6th 7th and 8th We are going to be running crazy events in Utica, New York.

57
00:04:11,871 --> 00:04:20,786
Rym: also at the same time at the same place There happens to be an anime con called CITACON S I T A con.

58
00:04:21,308 --> 00:04:22,331
Rym: we're gonna be guests there.

59
00:04:22,592 --> 00:04:24,940
Rym: We're gonna be running crazy awesome events.

60
00:04:25,463 --> 00:04:26,930
Rym: I absolutely guarantee.

61
00:04:27,051 --> 00:04:33,100
Rym: if you go and you find us And there's no way you won't find us a good time will be had or your money back.

62
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:35,831
Scott: Well there is a way by your money back to find us.

63
00:04:35,911 --> 00:04:38,120
Scott: if you are blind and deaf you might not find.

64
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:49,253
Rym: yeah, I mean if you go to this con just kind of walk around and wait for a ruckus to happen or look for loud people and We will probably be at the center of both the ruckus and the loudness.

65
00:04:49,534 --> 00:04:58,978
Scott: now because of this convention Rym is thinking about copping out of a show tomorrow, so I said hey instead of doing a show Why don't you put up the?

66
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,807
Scott: Infamous clown pistols all right?

67
00:05:01,947 --> 00:05:04,094
Rym: now the reason Scott brings us up is one.

68
00:05:04,114 --> 00:05:08,346
Rym: a lot of people have been asking about this and I've Responded to most of you just privately.

69
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:10,852
Rym: the fact is that we recorded it.

70
00:05:11,393 --> 00:05:16,688
Rym: the recording wasn't so great because we use GarageBand and One of the microphones was shitty.

71
00:05:16,748 --> 00:05:18,416
Rym: so it required a lot of editing.

72
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,240
Rym: also It was on the Mac in some Mac format.

73
00:05:22,843 --> 00:05:37,280
Rym: So Scott went through a lot of effort to get it into a wav format And it sat on my hard drive being neglected because I didn't feel like sitting down for an hour and editing the thing Because it'll take me more time to edit that down to be listenable then it takes me to do a month's worth of GeekNights

74
00:05:38,044 --> 00:05:38,164
Scott: Mm-hmm.

75
00:05:38,607 --> 00:05:39,411
Rym: so all right Scott.

76
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:40,235
Rym: I have the wav file.

77
00:05:40,255 --> 00:05:42,014
Rym: so a couple weeks ago I thought I'm gonna do it.

78
00:05:42,902 --> 00:05:50,948
Rym: And then I discovered that Scott through no fault of his own made the wav file wrong and it ended up being one channel Which defeated the purpose of having two channels?

79
00:05:50,988 --> 00:05:52,111
Scott: Yeah, it was Apple's fault.

80
00:05:52,312 --> 00:05:53,776
Rym: Yeah, it was GarageBand's fault.

81
00:05:53,877 --> 00:06:01,780
Scott: Yeah, but anyway Everyone go and pester Rym to edit the clown pistol and you'll be able to hear it tomorrow night.

82
00:06:02,921 --> 00:06:06,814
Scott: Us yeah, that's right rims gonna do that for you tomorrow.

83
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:08,098
Scott: You're gonna hear the clown pistol ing.

84
00:06:08,178 --> 00:06:10,229
Rym: finally Here's the deal.

85
00:06:10,451 --> 00:06:11,400
Rym: I'll do the clown pistol.

86
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:15,760
Rym: I will do what it takes to put up the clown pistol and all that tomorrow.

87
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:19,069
Scott: Aha, but but what in exchange?

88
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:22,919
Rym: you have to take care of getting all those flyers copied for the con.

89
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:25,756
Scott: alright Give me the I'll go print them out of the copier at work.

90
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:27,042
Scott: alright I can't be.

91
00:06:27,143 --> 00:06:28,928
Scott: I can't vouch for the quality of the copies.

92
00:06:29,109 --> 00:06:34,299
Rym: well make one copy make sure sure it's not shitty And then make a whole bunch more.

93
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:39,514
Rym: Maybe I will and if that fails well there aren't any kinkos anywhere near us.

94
00:06:39,674 --> 00:06:40,276
Scott: No there aren't.

95
00:06:40,296 --> 00:06:41,840
Scott: I'm sure there's one in Utica.

96
00:06:41,981 --> 00:06:43,367
Rym: Well, no there's a bunch of coffee places around.

97
00:06:43,387 --> 00:06:43,950
Rym: go find one.

98
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,020
Rym: Yeah, I don't think our listeners want to hear this part.

99
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,186
Rym: No, they don't though actually in the future.

100
00:06:48,206 --> 00:06:57,378
Rym: We're gonna start putting up as a special occasionally the pregame Where we actually do the you know pre-production stuff for the show because the people have been asking about that.

101
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:59,313
Scott: yeah So anyway, I got a news.

102
00:06:59,555 --> 00:07:00,060
Scott: you got a news.

103
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,287
Scott: Yeah, you remember the X Prize the you know.

104
00:07:02,307 --> 00:07:10,295
Scott: they gave them millions of dollars to whoever can make like a reusable Spaceflight vehicle whatever and someone won the prize.

105
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,988
Scott: Yeah, yeah Oh, they have a new X Prize.

106
00:07:13,048 --> 00:07:21,419
Scott: the X Prize Foundation has a new prize And they will give it ten million dollars to any team who takes X server and makes it work.

107
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:31,277
Scott: well no that can completely decode the genes of a hundred people in ten days and It ain't like ten days from now like you've got.

108
00:07:31,297 --> 00:07:39,904
Scott: no In a period of ten days, so you'd have to basically decode ten complete DNA is per day You know.

109
00:07:39,924 --> 00:07:42,540
Rym: so it's make an awesome computer.

110
00:07:42,981 --> 00:07:46,793
Scott: Yeah, it's basically make a way to decode genes really fast.

111
00:07:46,953 --> 00:07:47,876
Rym: you heard it here first.

112
00:07:48,057 --> 00:07:49,180
Rym: I'm based on things.

113
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:55,060
Rym: I know I'm going to hazard a bet that IBM is going to win the X Pro.

114
00:07:56,182 --> 00:07:59,457
Scott: Well now I think there's more to it than just the computer part.

115
00:07:59,537 --> 00:08:13,764
Rym: Oh no no no I can't say, but I'm basing this on knowledge as to specific applications That IBM is known to be using cell processors for either way very Specific application.

116
00:08:13,884 --> 00:08:23,258
Scott: if you win they'll pay you another million dollars to decode another hundred gene people people's genes in another ten days.

117
00:08:23,278 --> 00:08:25,061
Scott: I Don't know.

118
00:08:25,081 --> 00:08:25,664
Scott: it doesn't say that.

119
00:08:25,724 --> 00:08:38,315
Scott: but the point of it is I want our much smarter Biologist listeners who I know exist who you know have decoded DNA before Unlike us who haven't decoded any DNA at all.

120
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:41,926
Rym: actually I've done electrofluoresis About ten times in my life.

121
00:08:42,227 --> 00:08:46,119
Scott: how long does it take to decode one person's genes in the entirety?

122
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:46,159
Scott: I?

123
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,854
Rym: Can say that it took me?

124
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:55,000
Rym: Four attempts to correctly set up electrofluoresis where the gel didn't just suck.

125
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,345
Scott: Well if you know what the hell you're doing You know that's the people.

126
00:08:58,385 --> 00:09:02,439
Rym: also electrofluoresis is not really anything compared to what they're doing.

127
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:04,798
Scott: yeah What is that the best you know?

128
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:07,889
Scott: Equipment in the world of the best lab in the world.

129
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,973
Scott: how long does it take?

130
00:09:09,294 --> 00:09:11,180
Rym: yeah Pete you ever all remember Pete?

131
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,428
Rym: He's been on the show a couple times.

132
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:16,350
Rym: He's the GeekNights resident scientist To help us out here.

133
00:09:16,411 --> 00:09:17,438
Rym: We'll do a show on this.

134
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,101
Scott: yeah And how?

135
00:09:18,463 --> 00:09:22,760
Scott: how hard would it be to do ten full people's DNA in a day here?

136
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,660
Rym: I got the rip the scrim prize forget the X prize.

137
00:09:26,303 --> 00:09:36,174
Rym: I will give a dollar to the first person who sends us a Succinct Comprehensive explanation of what it takes to do what the X prize is asking.

138
00:09:36,335 --> 00:09:38,180
Scott: yep all right things of the day time.

139
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,193
Rym: Yeah, so Pete come and get your dollar.

140
00:09:40,214 --> 00:09:52,580
Rym: Yeah, I expect Lisa dancing things of the day.

141
00:09:54,253 --> 00:10:00,738
Rym: Now of course we've got three things of the day, and I guess I'll start with mine because it's totally not Anime manga or comic related.

142
00:10:00,758 --> 00:10:01,179
Scott: that's fine.

143
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,308
Scott: mine is an anime manga or comic related.

144
00:10:03,429 --> 00:10:04,368
Scott: either Fantastic

145
00:10:06,613 --> 00:10:25,467
Rym: Alright, so actually Scott found this but I watched it and it really exemplifies everything that I strive to be in my life, or it is a 18-minute video of Moderately clever to incredibly hilarious pranks being pulled on people now not like the Japanese toilet prank Which while probably the second funniest prank ever

146
00:10:25,528 --> 00:10:25,689
Scott: done?

147
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,277
Scott: It was just downright cruel.

148
00:10:28,297 --> 00:10:28,959
Scott: It wasn't cruel.

149
00:10:28,979 --> 00:10:29,642
Scott: That was awesome.

150
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,450
Rym: It was cruel in an awesome way.

151
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:36,045
Emily: You know they never showed any women did they like?

152
00:10:36,085 --> 00:10:39,201
Emily: there were some girls who went into it But they didn't show it when it came out though.

153
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,630
Rym: Yeah, cuz they took those videos home.

154
00:10:44,898 --> 00:10:47,485
Scott: No, but these the practical jokes in this video are actually.

155
00:10:47,826 --> 00:10:49,190
Scott: a lot of them involve fursuits.

156
00:10:49,551 --> 00:10:52,740
Rym: Yeah, they're not so much the kind of pranks like we usually.

157
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:57,636
Rym: you know a guy skeleton on a motorcycle scaring some homeless guy Best one ever.

158
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,749
Rym: it is much more along the muss.

159
00:11:03,051 --> 00:11:03,914
Rym: It's very much more.

160
00:11:03,975 --> 00:11:07,588
Rym: this idea of freaking squares, I mean the first one really exemplifies.

161
00:11:07,628 --> 00:11:08,070
Rym: What's going on?

162
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,149
Rym: No one gets hurt or anything.

163
00:11:09,532 --> 00:11:19,543
Rym: It's a guy just walking down the street and then suddenly about a hundred Fursuiters just suddenly run around the corner and chase him down totally out of the blue.

164
00:11:19,563 --> 00:11:25,190
Rym: or There's a display of a Santa Claus, and then he beats up this other guy just totally out of the blue.

165
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:28,082
Rym: It's almost more like performance art than a prank.

166
00:11:28,363 --> 00:11:31,400
Scott: Yeah, it's 18 minutes long though So it is prepared for a sit.

167
00:11:31,662 --> 00:11:32,709
Rym: It's well worth it.

168
00:11:33,212 --> 00:11:42,390
Rym: In fact, if you watched the owned video the own compilation This is probably that quality only pranks instead of people hurting themselves severely.

169
00:11:43,272 --> 00:11:46,869
Emily: Okay, but some of them I must admit we're pretty good All right.

170
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:53,209
Scott: So my thing today is this flash game called swords and sandals and it's about gladiator gladiator.

171
00:11:55,052 --> 00:11:58,528
Scott: Yeah, it has this music where that goes gladiator gladiator gladiator.

172
00:12:00,071 --> 00:12:02,639
Scott: Yeah, it's kind of cat really fucking annoying.

173
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,030
Scott: Yeah, but the way the game works really mostly because Scott keeps singing.

174
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:09,807
Emily: Yeah, I was gonna say I didn't hear the game, but I heard Scott in his room going.

175
00:12:09,907 --> 00:12:13,714
Rym: gladiator I'm sitting at work.

176
00:12:13,794 --> 00:12:15,480
Rym: I was wondering what that was all about.

177
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:20,140
Emily: Like I'm sitting out there reading a comic and I hear from the Gladiator I'm like Scott.

178
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:29,609
Rym: He doesn't even if no one's around Messaged me at work to say the word gladiator And then he said it again.

179
00:12:29,971 --> 00:12:40,508
Scott: so this is a really simple flash game where you have a gladiator that you customize and level up and buy equipment for and then You fight against other gladiators in the arena and you try to beat all the gladiators.

180
00:12:40,568 --> 00:12:41,010
Scott: and you know what?

181
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,759
Scott: It's impossible to win without cheating.

182
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:44,490
Scott: So cheating is very easy.

183
00:12:44,991 --> 00:12:46,455
Scott: Let me tell you the secret to cheating.

184
00:12:46,997 --> 00:12:52,010
Scott: create a new HTML file and embed the flash game in that HTML file.

185
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:59,570
Scott: Modify the 8th the script that embeds the flash to allow you access to the full flash menu.

186
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:04,110
Scott: Enter the arena right click on the flash game and click forward.

187
00:13:04,611 --> 00:13:11,209
Scott: This will take you from the arena to the screen which allows you to give your gladiator three skill points.

188
00:13:12,615 --> 00:13:18,582
Scott: Yes, you can repeat this indefinitely to give your Infinity skills.

189
00:13:18,663 --> 00:13:19,588
Rym: Let me get this straight.

190
00:13:19,728 --> 00:13:24,523
Rym: you Sat around with this impossible to beat flash game.

191
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:29,281
Rym: Mm-hmm and Wasted time figuring out how to cheat at a single player.

192
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:32,089
Scott: a forum gave me the idea so I didn't.

193
00:13:34,011 --> 00:13:36,019
Scott: You have no life.

194
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:36,441
Scott: what do?

195
00:13:36,501 --> 00:13:37,024
Scott: I was doing?

196
00:13:37,044 --> 00:13:37,767
Scott: nothing at work?

197
00:13:37,787 --> 00:13:38,409
Scott: What do you want from me?

198
00:13:39,513 --> 00:13:41,367
Rym: I'd say do work, but I didn't do anything.

199
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:41,669
Rym: today.

200
00:13:42,171 --> 00:13:43,917
Emily: You guys are crazy.

201
00:13:43,937 --> 00:13:45,943
Rym: It's like oh, I have no work.

202
00:13:46,044 --> 00:13:46,947
Rym: I'm miserable.

203
00:13:47,047 --> 00:13:47,970
Emily: They pay me to do.

204
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:52,069
Scott: It's really fun to cheat in this game because I mean you walk up to a guy.

205
00:13:52,774 --> 00:13:54,310
Scott: I had so much strength.

206
00:13:54,470 --> 00:14:02,258
Scott: My gladiator was twice the size of the enemy gladiators and I poked them with a sword and they fly across the screen Into a spiky pit.

207
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:08,950
Scott: it it was pretty funny I'll show you later.

208
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:17,096
Scott: But I yelled at a guy with the taunt command and that taunt caused the guy to fly back 20 feet and land in a spiky pit.

209
00:14:17,096 --> 00:14:19,222
Scott: 20 feet really far.

210
00:14:19,543 --> 00:14:22,150
Rym: Okay, not like 15 feet a bajillion feet.

211
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:27,186
Scott: It's 20 feet all the way across the arena 40 feet from one side of the Coliseum to the other great.

212
00:14:27,487 --> 00:14:28,089
Scott: That's how far.

213
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,394
Scott: It was awesome Paunting.

214
00:14:31,514 --> 00:14:32,618
Emily: it was crazy.

215
00:14:32,658 --> 00:14:37,914
Emily: if they could do that in baseball games like, you know, I want to see that Flies.

216
00:14:37,975 --> 00:14:38,701
Scott: Yeah, that's right.

217
00:14:38,782 --> 00:14:46,510
Emily: If you're doing it in hockey There wouldn't even be any fights because people would be you know Thing to that I came was I mean RIT hockey was went to the men's hockey games.

218
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:55,730
Rym: but our senior year we started going to some of the women's hockey games and I mean our women's hockey team was really good, but no one went to see the game as they can't fight.

219
00:14:56,073 --> 00:15:05,109
Rym: Yeah, they can't check check They can't fight and honestly the best player on the team was actually pretty piss poor Compared to even like the worst high school hockey player.

220
00:15:05,512 --> 00:15:08,311
Rym: Yeah, I really felt that but it was still fun to go because you know They.

221
00:15:08,613 --> 00:15:11,470
Rym: they really liked if people actually showed up and cheered and it was really a cool thing.

222
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:16,086
Rym: But I always brought my trumpet because I was the bugle boy in RIT.

223
00:15:16,186 --> 00:15:17,130
Rym: I played the bugle.

224
00:15:17,493 --> 00:15:21,538
Rym: You know when the other team was losing by a lot I'd play taps over on their side that kind of crap.

225
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:28,379
Rym: and if I played my trumpet at the girls hockey games Effectively everything stopped because it was so loud.

226
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,126
Rym: No, it's no one knew what to do.

227
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:34,816
Rym: It was like What's going on.

228
00:15:34,997 --> 00:15:37,409
Emily: it's kind of funny and sad at the same time.

229
00:15:38,052 --> 00:15:42,747
Rym: At least our girls hockey team kicked the asses of any other girls hockey team that they did.

230
00:15:42,968 --> 00:15:43,510
Scott: that they did.

231
00:15:45,035 --> 00:15:45,821
Emily: They had fun playing.

232
00:15:46,505 --> 00:15:55,494
Emily: Um Well, so I was at my friend and former roommate Macy's house last weekend in Long Island and her sister's a major Jayrock fan.

233
00:15:55,936 --> 00:15:58,750
Emily: so we ended up hanging out on the computer a long time.

234
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:04,779
Emily: well, Macy counseled her friend who was having issues with and So I was hanging out with younger sisters.

235
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,322
Emily: Okay.

236
00:16:05,563 --> 00:16:06,830
Emily: Okay, that's that's unimportant.

237
00:16:06,971 --> 00:16:09,829
Rym: But so anyway, I don't like the phrase issues with stuff.

238
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,544
Emily: You know a public forum here.

239
00:16:14,644 --> 00:16:23,947
Rym: so, you know respecting privacy and all that you really in the future We have a week planned called the worst people we know personally by name.

240
00:16:24,489 --> 00:16:25,353
Rym: Oh You know.

241
00:16:28,485 --> 00:16:35,694
Emily: so So I was watching internet videos with the little sister and she showed me this Abridged yugioh.

242
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:54,330
Emily: and the guy is actually pretty ambitious, you know, cuz he takes an episode a week Shortens it down to about five minutes three minutes or such and dubs it and it's it's sort of one of those Evangelion we death, you know Nescaflowne kind of dubbing parodies, but it's it's pretty well done.

243
00:16:54,671 --> 00:16:56,076
Emily: And even though it's pretty lame.

244
00:16:56,156 --> 00:16:58,644
Emily: There's at least one good laugh per episode.

245
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,209
Scott: So check it out.

246
00:17:00,651 --> 00:17:07,509
Scott: Yeah, I just watched part of one of the episodes and there was a. there was a ridge racer joke And also the dubbing is really good.

247
00:17:07,771 --> 00:17:15,138
Emily: The best part are the intros because every time they'll do like it will be in Spanish Or they'll do it like a soap opera or something like the.

248
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,424
Emily: the intros are the parts.

249
00:17:16,464 --> 00:17:18,290
Emily: They really mix up and screw around with.

250
00:17:19,952 --> 00:17:22,842
Emily: Yeah, this is kind of a time waster, but you can check it out.

251
00:17:23,364 --> 00:17:27,126
Rym: You know, we're all about time wasters Things that the day are for.

252
00:17:27,165 --> 00:17:27,510
Scott: it's funny.

253
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:28,987
Rym: All our other friends complain about.

254
00:17:29,008 --> 00:17:35,390
Rym: you know I have a job where they work me to death for no money and we if Josh we don't do anything We get a lot of money and we're just as angry and unhappy.

255
00:17:35,571 --> 00:17:37,720
Scott: I'm telling you that's how it's the scale of business.

256
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,090
Scott: the guy who gets paid dick the janitor, right?

257
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:44,419
Scott: You know, you'll miss him if he's gone But you pay him shit and he works real hard.

258
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,484
Scott: the CEO.

259
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:49,838
Scott: if they change the CEO You won't notice a difference at all, but he gets paid the most and does nothing.

260
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,663
Rym: Well, he does things.

261
00:17:51,884 --> 00:17:52,225
Rym: Yeah.

262
00:17:52,265 --> 00:17:53,368
Scott: Yeah, like I do things.

263
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:53,849
Scott: Yeah.

264
00:17:55,571 --> 00:18:09,717
Rym: Anyway today we're talking about perhaps the greatest English literature ever produced by the world Onto man and beast Ever put out by a man named Brian.

265
00:18:09,758 --> 00:18:10,520
Rym: Hey, man.

266
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,061
Emily: Hey, man.

267
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:14,010
Emily: Is it more discouraging than chickens as literature?

268
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,596
Emily: I heard a great you be white quote.

269
00:18:16,677 --> 00:18:19,489
Scott: It's it's good, but it's not that good.

270
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:22,825
Rym: You see I was building up to a joke that you really kind of killed.

271
00:18:22,885 --> 00:18:25,060
Rym: Yeah, but yeah I was gonna make a joke.

272
00:18:25,121 --> 00:18:26,030
Rym: There was a joke at the end of that.

273
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,797
Rym: Scott Pilgrim is not the best thing ever.

274
00:18:27,837 --> 00:18:29,684
Rym: However, Scott Pilgrim is pure love.

275
00:18:29,965 --> 00:18:32,034
Scott: It's Awesome.

276
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:37,416
Rym: now if you've not read Scott Pilgrim, we're not gonna spoil much Probably gonna spoil a couple things.

277
00:18:37,757 --> 00:18:39,722
Rym: but most importantly go read Scott Pilgrim.

278
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,370
Rym: There are only three trades out right now.

279
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,616
Rym: You can just go buy them all.

280
00:18:43,878 --> 00:18:44,039
Rym: Mm-hmm.

281
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:46,150
Scott: Yeah, they look like manga, but they're not.

282
00:18:46,932 --> 00:18:55,289
Emily: Yeah, I picked it up in the bookstore cuz it was you know in the manga shelf and I saw Scott pilgrims precious little life And I was like, that's a great title for a comic book.

283
00:18:55,611 --> 00:18:57,618
Emily: so I picked it up and I leave through it and it.

284
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:07,090
Emily: the art is what really first caught my eye because it was the Eyes are drawn very big and circular like his very very highly stylized and drawn with like a brush.

285
00:19:07,652 --> 00:19:11,250
Emily: So it's like this ink ink strokes very thick lines and stuff.

286
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:16,142
Emily: And so it's got certain manga stylings, but really it's.

287
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,970
Emily: it's very unique and as far as its art style.

288
00:19:20,074 --> 00:19:21,549
Emily: But what really makes it is the script?

289
00:19:22,531 --> 00:19:28,910
Rym: Yes, I mean it's hard to explain what is like what it is like why this is different from other comics.

290
00:19:29,011 --> 00:19:31,726
Rym: It's about kids in a rock band.

291
00:19:31,746 --> 00:19:40,738
Scott: Yeah It's also River City Ransom, it's also Freaking every awesome video game pair.

292
00:19:40,778 --> 00:19:44,530
Emily: Yeah, it's a million bajillion Nintendo games like old school.

293
00:19:45,632 --> 00:19:50,992
Rym: And the plot the actual plot of Scott Pilgrim is very simply okay It's not.

294
00:19:51,033 --> 00:19:52,460
Rym: pilgrim likes a girl.

295
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,129
Scott: No, Scott pilgrim is awesome.

296
00:19:55,391 --> 00:19:57,095
Emily: Okay, Scott pilgrim is awesome.

297
00:19:57,135 --> 00:20:00,424
Emily: Scott pilgrim is dating a high schooler is the first lie.

298
00:20:00,485 --> 00:20:02,310
Rym: In fact, that's the name of the first chapter.

299
00:20:05,852 --> 00:20:06,674
Emily: Set up right.

300
00:20:06,835 --> 00:20:07,035
Rym: Yep.

301
00:20:07,677 --> 00:20:09,724
Scott: Scott pilgrim has a gay roommate who's awesome.

302
00:20:09,764 --> 00:20:11,810
Emily: Who's also all this is the best character.

303
00:20:12,031 --> 00:20:18,229
Scott: I I say Scott pilgrim is in a band called Sex Bob-omb, which is an obvious homage to.

304
00:20:18,269 --> 00:20:19,489
Scott: yes There are other bands.

305
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:28,797
Rym: There are other bands in this comic called such things as clash at demon head Which if you don't know what that is, you are not from the video game generation Sonic and Knuckles.

306
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:33,011
Emily: Yeah, all the bands are named after old Frickin.

307
00:20:33,152 --> 00:20:38,946
Rym: everything this is nothing but references to pop geek culture from the mid 80s to the mid 90s.

308
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:50,529
Scott: Basically the the course of the story is that there is a girl Ramona flowers who Scott pilgrim kind of digs more than Knives chow who's in high school?

309
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:54,478
Emily: She's a delivery girl for Canadian amazon.com.

310
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:55,822
Scott: amazon.ca.

311
00:20:55,902 --> 00:20:58,590
Rym: Well, you know, yeah dot ca.com.

312
00:21:00,355 --> 00:21:01,350
Rym: Okay, we're not really good.

313
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:08,550
Rym: I mean we could talk a lot about the specifics because the way he actually meets her Really kind of sets the stage for what this kind of comic is.

314
00:21:09,152 --> 00:21:10,916
Scott: The whole plot is there.

315
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:19,121
Scott: she Ramona flowers has seven evil ex-boyfriends and Scott pilgrim Has to fight all of them in order to date her.

316
00:21:19,342 --> 00:21:21,290
Rym: Yep, but she totally likes Scott pilgrim.

317
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,659
Scott: So she totally does and he totally likes her.

318
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:26,108
Scott: but he still has to fight the seven evil ex-boyfriends.

319
00:21:26,148 --> 00:21:31,367
Scott: in each volume Some evil ex-boyfriend or boyfriends show up and are fought.

320
00:21:31,949 --> 00:21:35,482
Rym: now I mean, it's even finding the point that they don't say right away seven.

321
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,430
Rym: They're kind of vague like five or six.

322
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,136
Scott: He's like not to fight them all at once.

323
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:42,770
Scott: Well, maybe not all at once, but maybe not one at a time either.

324
00:21:42,971 --> 00:21:47,694
Rym: Yeah, now this comics put up by Brian Lee O'Malley Draws it and he writes it.

325
00:21:47,734 --> 00:21:50,502
Rym: It's being published by oni press who's awesome.

326
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:53,030
Rym: It's coming out real slowly.

327
00:21:54,494 --> 00:22:09,155
Emily: You know, I I'm not a fan of LiveJournal or stalking people on LiveJournal, but after you read the comic I'd suggest checking out his blog because he does this thing called annotated Scott pilgrim and he puts up all his reference photos Explains what you know.

328
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:12,063
Emily: all the settings and characters and stuff are based on like.

329
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:24,856
Emily: it's so full of inside jokes Like not even just Nintendo jokes and stuff, but he gives a lot of props to his friends in there, you know He's like, oh, you know, I'm gonna write my like his roommates based on an old roommate He used to have.

330
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:26,125
Emily: you know, I'm not sure if they wait a minute.

331
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:26,508
Emily: Wait a minute.

332
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,055
Emily: So no Wallace.

333
00:22:28,115 --> 00:22:29,841
Scott: Wallace is a real guy.

334
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:32,170
Rym: There's a real guy out there who's like Wallace.

335
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:35,690
Emily: Yeah, I don't know if they actually like shared the same mattress or anything.

336
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,187
Rym: Homosexuality plus plus.

337
00:22:42,312 --> 00:22:43,841
Rym: Now Wallace is the man.

338
00:22:43,921 --> 00:22:45,390
Rym: in fact probably my favorite.

339
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:50,043
Scott: Almost every character is the man even if they're the woman.

340
00:22:50,465 --> 00:22:53,395
Rym: but what my favorite scene in the whole thing Barnon is.

341
00:22:53,536 --> 00:22:56,530
Rym: Scott is laying on the ground and he's sad and he's pissed off.

342
00:22:56,811 --> 00:23:02,110
Rym: He's miserable and the world's sad and he's laying there and he's like, you know, what sucks everything everything sucks.

343
00:23:02,471 --> 00:23:06,347
Rym: And Wallace is standing there and he's making bacon and he says listen to this.

344
00:23:06,408 --> 00:23:10,381
Rym: Okay, just listen You hear that that's market bacon hitting the pan today.

345
00:23:10,401 --> 00:23:13,210
Rym: A child is born unto us and his name will be bacon.

346
00:23:13,953 --> 00:23:14,355
Rym: Smell it.

347
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:17,149
Rym: Do you smell that smell that everything does not suck?

348
00:23:19,911 --> 00:23:20,373
Scott: It's true.

349
00:23:20,393 --> 00:23:30,490
Rym: I mean the humors all like that is kind of this low-key but yet at the same time Completely out of the blue out of the water over the top people flying through the air throwing knives at each other.

350
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:38,480
Scott: Yeah I think I think what makes this comic more than anything else are all the characters that are awesome and the dialogue Interaction just has a really nice flow to it.

351
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,910
Emily: It's like a lot of back-and-forth kind of banter.

352
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:45,626
Rym: It's very much the kind of banter that you hear between two people playing a video game.

353
00:23:45,686 --> 00:23:45,927
Emily: Yeah.

354
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:52,314
Rym: Yeah Now the thing is it starts out really kind of mundane, you know, there's a little weirdness But it's kind of just a story.

355
00:23:52,956 --> 00:23:55,604
Rym: and then it gets more and more video gamey.

356
00:23:55,624 --> 00:23:59,328
Rym: like at one point Scott beats this guy The best part.

357
00:23:59,388 --> 00:24:02,261
Rym: I love One guy and money falls out.

358
00:24:02,281 --> 00:24:03,790
Rym: He's like sweet like a dollar.

359
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:08,886
Rym: But then he beats one guy and his own head appears floating and he freaks out.

360
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:10,070
Rym: He's like the hell is this?

361
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,940
Rym: It's creeping me out and they're like, it's an extra life dude.

362
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,804
Emily: He's like, oh sweet.

363
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,326
Rym: He grabs it.

364
00:24:14,346 --> 00:24:16,933
Emily: I Still think the funniest thing.

365
00:24:16,993 --> 00:24:18,396
Emily: Well other than the coins falling down.

366
00:24:18,437 --> 00:24:23,016
Emily: It's like spare chains falling down and My favorite one was there.

367
00:24:23,216 --> 00:24:26,747
Emily: They're in a club like before a gig and so they're all waiting around.

368
00:24:26,768 --> 00:24:34,398
Emily: and there's this He looks over in the corner and there's this white glowy spot, you know This is before he's going to talk to his ex-girlfriend.

369
00:24:34,438 --> 00:24:37,650
Emily: So he's really nervous and he sees his white glowy spot in the corner.

370
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,573
Emily: He's like, what's that?

371
00:24:38,914 --> 00:24:40,319
Emily: Is it a safe spot?

372
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:43,590
Emily: and Kim is like, yeah, it's a safe spot and he makes for it.

373
00:24:46,231 --> 00:24:47,215
Rym: Gotta go and see.

374
00:24:47,335 --> 00:24:55,210
Rym: it's like this normal world with normal people except at the same time It's this video game world and got like magic portals and like super excited.

375
00:24:56,151 --> 00:25:04,275
Scott: Yeah, my favorite video game joke is when he says so are you guys an item and he's his items and you see a mushroom A star and a flower.

376
00:25:04,396 --> 00:25:04,897
Scott: that's like.

377
00:25:04,938 --> 00:25:06,563
Rym: that's all he can think about.

378
00:25:06,643 --> 00:25:07,967
Scott: Yeah, he's like.

379
00:25:08,027 --> 00:25:08,810
Scott: no not that item.

Rym: You can't have 10 pokemons.

383
00:25:12,605 --> 00:25:13,850
Rym: You can't read 10 Scott pilgrims.

384
00:25:14,051 --> 00:25:16,359
Scott: You can't read 10 Scott phone cuz it's only three Scott pilgrims.

385
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,704
Rym: There's going to be only six.

386
00:25:17,764 --> 00:25:18,828
Rym: It's already halfway over.

387
00:25:19,089 --> 00:25:21,282
Scott: wait But I thought there were seven evil ex-boyfriends.

388
00:25:21,303 --> 00:25:21,886
Scott: What's up for that?

389
00:25:21,906 --> 00:25:22,228
Scott: Huh?

390
00:25:23,471 --> 00:25:29,129
Emily: Let's see, he's already beaten three of them and that you we know spoilers OMG.

391
00:25:34,512 --> 00:25:41,809
Scott: They did say that Scott pilgrim was like the best fighter in like the area There's so many is up against vegans.

392
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:45,523
Scott: Scott pilgrim is just that.

393
00:25:45,563 --> 00:25:52,068
Rym: no, it's not that vegans have psychic powers It's just that the guys like watch out this guy's a vegan and everyone knows just like.

394
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,977
Rym: oh He's got vegan powers then.

395
00:25:53,997 --> 00:25:55,443
Rym: Yeah, and it's just straight-up.

396
00:25:55,483 --> 00:25:56,407
Rym: vegans have powers.

397
00:25:56,749 --> 00:26:01,646
Rym: Yep I mean that he'll throw in all this weird stuff, but it's so mundane.

398
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:03,593
Rym: You just it's just part of it You don't even wonder.

399
00:26:03,614 --> 00:26:10,149
Rym: I mean the first guy he fights the first ex-boyfriend Just summons a bunch of demon hipster girls and then they have a dance-off.

400
00:26:11,411 --> 00:26:18,774
Emily: It's one of those things where he achieves a remarkable level of suspension of disbelief, you know Good way to put it.

401
00:26:18,874 --> 00:26:28,030
Emily: funniest thing is it's been optioned for a film and you know It was rumors on the internet and it's even on his site and I checked on studio systems and it's got.

402
00:26:29,131 --> 00:26:29,271
Emily: It's.

403
00:26:29,472 --> 00:26:33,302
Emily: it's not been written yet, but it's got a script writer assigned and it's been optioned.

404
00:26:33,363 --> 00:26:39,910
Rym: and everything in 2005 Universal announced I'm coding Wikipedia that they have optioned the property for a possible future film adaptation.

405
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:44,330
Rym: Edgar Wright is attached as director and Michael Bacall is to write the screenplay.

406
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:46,319
Emily: So I'm looking forward to this.

407
00:26:46,379 --> 00:26:50,889
Emily: if it's ever done as animation it could be really slick Yeah, or even live-action might work.

408
00:26:51,211 --> 00:26:58,954
Emily: Yeah, actually, it might be really really funny as live-action considering the whole sort of magical realism video game world Maybe.

409
00:26:58,974 --> 00:27:01,688
Scott: I think you would just it would definitely because animation is the way to go.

410
00:27:02,271 --> 00:27:13,399
Emily: I mean the art style is so cute, you know, it'd be a damn shame not to see that It would be hard to do all the brush lines Mmm, you couldn't just animate it the way it's drawn.

411
00:27:13,419 --> 00:27:14,784
Emily: Yeah, it would be.

412
00:27:14,804 --> 00:27:16,470
Emily: it would be more difficult.

413
00:27:17,072 --> 00:27:22,210
Rym: Think how about with computers if they just made models and stuff course then because the art changes a lot.

414
00:27:22,271 --> 00:27:22,593
Rym: It's real.

415
00:27:22,613 --> 00:27:24,489
Rym: the character designs are really kind of loose.

416
00:27:24,592 --> 00:27:30,707
Scott: Yeah sometimes I get a little bit confused as to who's who because there's no color and you need to kind of it.

417
00:27:30,727 --> 00:27:42,930
Emily: sometimes they'll point out Like they'll draw a little line and say she dyed her hair Like Ramona is kind of like me cuz I'm always doing weird stuff with my hair and You know dyeing it and chopping it off and stuff.

418
00:27:43,231 --> 00:27:49,910
Emily: And so Ramona is doing the same thing and she's got a different hairstyle every chapter and it does get a little bit confusing.

419
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:52,798
Scott: Yeah, I made like Scott Pilgrim here.

420
00:27:52,899 --> 00:27:56,070
Scott: He worries about a haircut and then you know, they make a big deal out of it.

421
00:27:57,052 --> 00:27:58,538
Emily: He doesn't like getting its hair cut.

422
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:00,708
Rym: He also doesn't realize that bread can make you fat.

423
00:28:02,311 --> 00:28:03,414
Rym: I'm just I'm flipping through it.

424
00:28:03,675 --> 00:28:06,182
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot of things he doesn't realize.

425
00:28:06,363 --> 00:28:08,710
Rym: Yeah now, I mean all the characters are awesome.

426
00:28:09,232 --> 00:28:10,777
Rym: We should probably talk about him a little bit.

427
00:28:10,797 --> 00:28:12,102
Rym: I mean, there's Scott Pilgrim.

428
00:28:12,343 --> 00:28:13,647
Emily: Let's do an introduction.

429
00:28:13,828 --> 00:28:22,214
Rym: Scott Pilgrim He is the best fighter around even though he actually seems to kind of suck and everything And he doesn't.

430
00:28:22,354 --> 00:28:30,700
Emily: he's actually kind of soft-hearted and he doesn't want to fight Sometimes and he won't hit girls and that was a big thing.

431
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:39,742
Emily: a bunch of evil girls jumped out of movie posters and attacked him and he refused to hit him and and Ramona had to come and kind of wasn't that in like a web thingy.

432
00:28:39,822 --> 00:28:41,548
Emily: No, that wasn't free comic day.

433
00:28:41,568 --> 00:28:42,070
Emily: Yeah, that's right.

434
00:28:44,253 --> 00:28:45,730
Rym: That's actually how I found.

435
00:28:47,973 --> 00:28:51,729
Rym: It was I do who kept telling me read Scott Pilgrim read Scott Pilgrim.

436
00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:52,652
Emily: I know Yeah, she was.

437
00:28:52,954 --> 00:28:56,648
Emily: she'd like do little things of her characters in the same style and stuff.

438
00:28:56,929 --> 00:29:00,681
Rym: Yeah She's probably the biggest guy I know I've ever seen.

439
00:29:00,701 --> 00:29:06,182
Rym: and she telling me read Scott Pilgrim read Scott Pilgrim And then she introduced us to Brian Lee O'Malley.

440
00:29:06,463 --> 00:29:07,467
Rym: We got to meet him.

441
00:29:07,568 --> 00:29:08,130
Scott: Oh, that's right.

442
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:11,260
Scott: He probably wouldn't recognize if we met him again.

443
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,425
Emily: He did a little sketch.

444
00:29:12,465 --> 00:29:13,730
Rym: There's a little Ramona sketch.

445
00:29:13,891 --> 00:29:14,533

Rym: Mm-hmm But yeah, and then I got free comic book day.

448
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:25,582
Rym: There was the free scout pilgrim and it was unmitigated awesome.

449
00:29:26,184 --> 00:29:27,710
Scott: It's all of its unmitigated awesome.

450
00:29:28,172 --> 00:29:38,748
Rym: So Ramona flowers pretty much a ninja delivery girl Also has seven evil ex-boyfriends and wants to date Scott and she's not stupid as Scott.

451
00:29:38,808 --> 00:29:39,530
Scott: She's pretty smart.

452
00:29:39,751 --> 00:29:46,584
Rym: She is a really cool well-rounded Character with a secret history that is obviously going to come into play with this guy.

453
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,648
Scott: Yeah, she's got that's.

454
00:29:47,668 --> 00:29:50,470
Scott: the only thing wrong With Ramona is that she has like these secrets.

455
00:29:50,631 --> 00:29:52,600
Scott: I don't know what the secrets are like.

456
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,670
Scott: she could be up to no good, but she's probably not.

457
00:29:55,396 --> 00:29:56,869
Emily: Oh, I don't think she's up to no.

458
00:29:57,891 --> 00:30:12,156
Rym: She's got a past and she's trying to you know, she's trying to leave it behind But yeah, but there are references to the fact in the third one that she might actually be evil and this is all some sort of Yeah, I didn't get that.

459
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:13,945
Emily: that's gonna have to read it again.

460
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:15,110
Rym: I was getting yeah.

461
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:22,875
Scott: It's kind of sketchy like because you could try to get stuff but it's not so Fleshed out fully.

462
00:30:22,975 --> 00:30:31,305
Rym: so you're kind of iffy on a lot of especially when again it is hard sometimes to tell Exactly, like you'll change pages and the scenes all switched around.

463
00:30:31,365 --> 00:30:32,330
Rym: It's hard to tell who's who.

464
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:35,310
Scott: Yeah It's so low is sometimes a little messed up.

465
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:41,450
Rym: My advice is to not try to figure out what's happening or not what's happening, but what's going on and just roll with it.

466
00:30:42,892 --> 00:30:45,139
Emily: You'll get a city action like there's a.

467
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,809
Rym: you could figure out a whole bunch of stuff and it's totally not worth it.

468
00:30:48,772 --> 00:30:59,990
Rym: So then there's knives child the 17 year old girl that Scott Pilgrim was dating in high school Who and I think Emily agrees with me is probably the best representation of a high school girl I've ever seen in a comic.

469
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:00,833
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

470
00:31:00,914 --> 00:31:03,082
Rym: It's so accurate as to what high school girls are like.

471
00:31:03,123 --> 00:31:06,698
Rym: no offense to our high school girl listeners But you were all like this girl.

472
00:31:06,979 --> 00:31:07,682
Rym: Yeah, pretty much.

473
00:31:07,742 --> 00:31:09,430
Rym: I mean good God all of them.

474
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:12,301
Emily: Maybe they don't go around attacking people with.

475
00:31:12,361 --> 00:31:21,829
Scott: you know, ah, I knew a girl in high school But Scott Pilgrim dates knives chow and you know, then he kind of doesn't.

476
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:30,281
Emily: yeah She does the Asian Asian gossipy thing where she's like reward as a fat white girl Yeah, and Bobby's kind of Fabi and stuff like that.

477
00:31:30,762 --> 00:31:32,046
Emily: She talks like some people.

478
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:41,387
Rym: I know it's so funny But I mean while she's an annoying high school girl But your character is also very cute and endearing and very sweet when she's not stabbing people.

479
00:31:41,407 --> 00:31:45,969
Scott: She's not bad He's just you know, he's just the way high school girls are.

480
00:31:46,692 --> 00:31:53,230
Rym: Yeah, and of course the only reason this mom of this comic actually exists and the only reason to live Wallace Wells Scott's gay roommate.

481
00:31:53,312 --> 00:31:56,019
Scott: Oh my god Rims gave her me.

482
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:01,539
Rym: there's a section of like 10 Parts of this manga where I keep calling it a manga.

483
00:32:01,579 --> 00:32:04,730
Emily: It's not it's a kind is I mean they classify it in the manga section?

484
00:32:06,072 --> 00:32:08,020
Rym: Yeah, but I mean they all put it in the manga section.

485
00:32:08,321 --> 00:32:09,345
Rym: it sounds like manga.

486
00:32:09,405 --> 00:32:10,530
Rym: a lot of people call it manga.

487
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:12,679
Rym: Yeah, the word is kind of broad.

488
00:32:12,719 --> 00:32:15,129
Rym: It's a graphic novel, but there's this whole.

489
00:32:16,012 --> 00:32:24,761
Rym: They very often will have a little black box next to a character with like their name their age And then something about him relevant to the scene.

490
00:32:24,821 --> 00:32:25,866
Rym: and it happens all the time.

491
00:32:25,926 --> 00:32:26,710
Rym: It's like a running gag.

492
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:35,830
Scott: Well, I'd say at the beginning of every book the first time you see a character, you know in each volume They'll put a little black box telling you the characters name and a sentence about them.

493
00:32:36,171 --> 00:32:41,629
Rym: Yeah, but they also do it sometimes randomly and almost always Wallace gets incredibly gay.

494
00:32:43,096 --> 00:32:44,170
Emily: No, pretty dang game.

495
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:51,794
Rym: And then it'll point to Scott Pilgrim like not gay or or the other Scott What was it?

496
00:32:52,456 --> 00:32:53,620
Emily: He doesn't have a last name.

497
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,764
Emily: They just call him the other.

498
00:32:54,864 --> 00:32:56,469
Emily: Oh, that's also done one.

499
00:32:58,052 --> 00:33:03,314
Rym: Now that would be school, yeah, especially in the third when they introduced all these other characters that totally don't matter But they all get a name.

500
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:10,686
Emily: Yeah and a funny bit about them, but like so many He actually knows and the places are just you know.

501
00:33:10,746 --> 00:33:13,235
Emily: on his on his blog He posts up all these like.

502
00:33:13,316 --> 00:33:18,574
Emily: this was taken from this place and it's just all his old hunts in Toronto.

503
00:33:18,935 --> 00:33:22,869
Rym: it's kind of funny but Wallace Wells is easily the funniest character in this comic.

504
00:33:23,411 --> 00:33:26,879
Emily: He's very kind he's got kind.

505
00:33:26,979 --> 00:33:31,270
Emily: he'll kind of tease Scott and pick on him, but he's very generous.

506
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,416
Rym: He's also Scott's kind of Yoda.

507
00:33:33,436 --> 00:33:35,041
Rym: He teaches Scott.

508
00:33:35,082 --> 00:33:35,884
Rym: He guides him.

509
00:33:36,004 --> 00:33:37,409
Emily: Yeah, it's kind of like Scott's.

510
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:37,931
Emily: He's.

511
00:33:38,111 --> 00:33:39,938
Emily: he's clueless but endearing.

512
00:33:40,139 --> 00:33:41,846
Emily: Yeah, it's kind of like Oh Scott.

513
00:33:41,866 --> 00:33:42,950
Emily: You're being a dick again.

514
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:43,733
Emily: Why are you doing that?

515
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:47,066
Emily: And then like Wallace Ramona will talk some sense into him.

516
00:33:47,126 --> 00:33:47,849
Emily: That's kind of nice.

517
00:33:48,631 --> 00:33:50,215
Scott: Yeah, it's a voice of reason.

518
00:33:50,235 --> 00:33:56,030
Scott: it seems like those are the only two characters who are really like smarter than Scott and everyone else is.

519
00:33:56,150 --> 00:34:02,650
Scott: You know, it's like Scott is in the middle and everyone else is either like stupid normal or evil in some way.

520
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,801
Rym: Well, then there's the other only character.

521
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:06,410
Rym: I really want to talk about Kim pine.

522
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:11,045
Rym: Kim is good who is easily the smartest character in the comic.

523
00:34:11,065 --> 00:34:12,270
Rym: She's very grumpy.

524
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:15,021
Rym: She doesn't care at all about any of this going on.

525
00:34:15,061 --> 00:34:17,230
Rym: She's the one who's always like it's a one-up.

526
00:34:17,592 --> 00:34:19,049
Rym: Yeah, it's a save point.

527
00:34:19,732 --> 00:34:21,518
Emily: Scott's high school girlfriend.

528
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:22,822
Emily: Yeah kind of sullen.

529
00:34:22,922 --> 00:34:25,050
Scott: and now she's the drummer for sex Baba.

530
00:34:25,451 --> 00:34:31,550
Rym: She's kind of surly and she reminds me of some people we know because she's surly in the not actually surly kind of way.

531
00:34:31,811 --> 00:34:32,877
Emily: Am I surely?

532
00:34:32,897 --> 00:34:32,937
Emily: no.

533
00:34:33,581 --> 00:34:34,204
Emily: Oh good.

534
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:34,626
Emily: Okay.

535
00:34:34,928 --> 00:34:41,547
Rym: I was referring See again the privacy because I'm saving it all.

536
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:46,670
Emily: or When you come out with the episode that just disses everyone our friends.

537
00:34:47,635 --> 00:34:53,987
Rym: Lee Nesbitt 41 Rochester Street was a total dick to us when we were sophomores in college.

538
00:34:54,168 --> 00:34:58,548
Scott: Oh, yeah Rym pine was this total dick.

539
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,799
Scott: Kind of jokes got me some real tires.

540
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,830
Emily: That's kind of like kind of like a dream sweepers greatest hit.

541
00:35:12,292 --> 00:35:14,309
Rym: Kind of joke your mom makes when she's tired.

542
00:35:20,311 --> 00:35:29,928
Emily: My favorite joke was when he's complaining as the bus drives away like I think Wallace Tells him he can't come home or he's having somebody over so he has to go to.

543
00:35:30,571 --> 00:35:33,890
Scott: Yeah, that's always an issue is like when Scott wants to have a girl over.

544
00:35:34,973 --> 00:35:39,387
Emily: He doesn't even have his own bed and one time they have a diagram of the room and it's just.

545
00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:47,070
Emily: you know, like Wallace's TV It labels everything and tells who the owner is and it's less just like Wallace Wallace Wallace Wallace.

546
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:49,577
Emily: And then it's like mess on the floor Scott.

547
00:35:49,978 --> 00:35:52,485
Emily: Don't be poster Scott and that's like the only thing.

548
00:35:52,645 --> 00:35:56,928
Emily: so basically he's just Borrowing all his roommates things.

549
00:35:58,195 --> 00:35:58,864
Rym: No, Scott feel good.

550
00:35:58,884 --> 00:36:01,899
Emily: I mean I think that shirts mine.

551
00:36:02,601 --> 00:36:02,943
Emily: It is.

552
00:36:02,963 --> 00:36:03,705
Emily: Yeah.

553
00:36:03,725 --> 00:36:04,889
Emily: Well, I wore it yesterday.

554
00:36:05,854 --> 00:36:09,550
Rym: Yeah, the comic keeps alluding to things in the past that it doesn't explain at all.

555
00:36:09,831 --> 00:36:14,670
Rym: So it's pretty much totally open and they can just make up whatever they need to make up whenever they need to make anything.

556
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:15,714
Scott: Uh, who's they?

557
00:36:15,794 --> 00:36:17,440
Scott: he one guy makes the whole thing.

558
00:36:17,601 --> 00:36:19,828
Rym: We have like the characters themselves couldn't make it.

559
00:36:19,869 --> 00:36:24,190
Rym: Oh, yeah Yeah, it's just totally up in the air as to what's actually going on at any point.

560
00:36:25,271 --> 00:36:27,381
Emily: That makes it sound just too random though.

561
00:36:27,401 --> 00:36:40,087
Emily: It is really kind of random Yeah, but you know in a way that doesn't drive you off like some things stay there too Fragmented and it's really hard to follow any sort of through line of the characters.

562
00:36:40,167 --> 00:36:40,650
Emily: Where's this?

563
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:43,895
Emily: Yeah, that's the point.

564
00:36:43,975 --> 00:36:45,942
Emily: Yeah, that's just nonsensical Monza.

565
00:36:45,962 --> 00:36:53,550
Rym: I kind of yeah, but like it's got pilgrim Don't try to read it like you would read a deep work of comic literature.

566
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:58,687
Rym: Don't like puzzle over every page and read every word like huh Scott said this.

567
00:36:58,747 --> 00:37:03,247
Rym: I wonder if that means blah Just run with it read the whole book in one go and then go.

568
00:37:03,267 --> 00:37:03,930
Rym: that was awesome.

569
00:37:04,911 --> 00:37:07,239
Scott: Yeah, I think that's really the only problem with it, you know.

570
00:37:07,299 --> 00:37:10,549
Scott: other is that it's kind of disjointed and it doesn't you know.

571
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:23,750
Scott: I mean the pacing of it is good like the rate at which things happen, you know, and depending on what's happening is really good Except sometimes you can get lost because sometimes someone will say something that feels like it should be a page ahead.

572
00:37:24,234 --> 00:37:25,769
Scott: You know, it feels like you lost a page.

573
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:27,859
Scott: You're like is a page torn out of the book what happened?

574
00:37:28,241 --> 00:37:30,190
Scott: or sometimes you'll feel like you went back a page.

575
00:37:30,674 --> 00:37:37,195
Scott: you know, it gets a little weird but Other than that, it's it's fantastic Very inventive.

576
00:37:37,717 --> 00:37:38,119
Emily: things like.

577
00:37:38,179 --> 00:37:44,510
Emily: I like the one where he does the little Panels as I was gonna say that before things that I thought were funny.

578
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:57,390
Emily: But as as well as says you can't come home You got to go over to Ramona's place and the bus is driving away and the panels just like divide by half And they get really really tiny and you have to have practically a magnifying glass to read the last one.

579
00:37:57,852 --> 00:38:00,343
Emily: It's just like him insulting Wallace's go in.

580
00:38:00,423 --> 00:38:04,588
Emily: It's just kind of like as the bus goes Insults - they're my they were good in size.

581
00:38:05,513 --> 00:38:08,407
Rym: So if nothing else, you'll get a lot of good insults out of this.

582
00:38:08,648 --> 00:38:18,026
Scott: Yes Now especially if you're in high school, these won't work so well outside of high school But in high school these apart, I think they'll work really well among our demographic.

583
00:38:18,247 --> 00:38:20,155
Scott: They will indeed That's another thing.

584
00:38:20,195 --> 00:38:20,899
Scott: Is this comic?

585
00:38:21,462 --> 00:38:22,849
Scott: if you're not in the geek?

586
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:23,994
Scott: Demographic.

587
00:38:24,054 --> 00:38:25,403
Scott: this might not hit home.

588
00:38:25,423 --> 00:38:28,860
Rym: you weren't born between 1979 and 1989.

589
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,269
Rym: Scott Pilgrim will make no sense to you most likely.

590
00:38:31,971 --> 00:38:33,597
Emily: So this is this is a great part.

591
00:38:33,637 --> 00:38:37,910
Emily: Wallace is heckling this one band from the balcony and they play really really passes.

592
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:40,200
Emily: it's not a race guys and the.

593
00:38:40,562 --> 00:38:42,169
Emily: the girl who's the vocalist is.

594
00:38:43,251 --> 00:38:46,404
Emily: The song is for the guy who keeps yelling from the balcony and it's called we hate you.

595
00:38:46,444 --> 00:38:51,235
Emily: Please die one, two, three Goofy little things like that.

596
00:38:51,255 --> 00:38:53,765
Rym: Yeah, every joke is the throwaway joke.

597
00:38:53,925 --> 00:38:55,090
Rym: Yeah, there's a million of them.

598
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:59,770
Scott: Now if you don't it seems like the whole thing is just an excuse to pile on these throwaway jokes.

599
00:38:59,911 --> 00:39:04,578
Rym: But yet the story is Pretty good like at its core.

600
00:39:04,618 --> 00:39:08,690
Rym: the actual story if you take it at face value seems like a good story.

601
00:39:09,092 --> 00:39:10,438
Rym: It's not even story.

602
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:12,689
Emily: It's more like the emotions behind it.

603
00:39:12,971 --> 00:39:15,021
Emily: It's like Scott being lost.

604
00:39:15,062 --> 00:39:16,650
Emily: you really feel for the characters.

605
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:23,890
Emily: It's not even so much you're engaged in a in a story as you're engaged with the feelings of the characters and you empathize with them.

606
00:39:25,171 --> 00:39:37,890
Rym: Yeah, I mean there's a scene in the third one where a character was a bad person and everyone agrees and that character gets kicked in the nuts And that is such a moment of vindication in that comic.

607
00:39:38,191 --> 00:39:38,913
Rym: It is in deal.

608
00:39:39,234 --> 00:39:41,200
Rym: you're right there with everyone in the crowd really.

609
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,604
Rym: Yeah, that guy got kicked in the nuts.

610
00:39:43,226 --> 00:39:44,129
Rym: Totally deserved it.

611
00:39:45,772 --> 00:39:48,122
Rym: now if you don't believe us is how awesome Scott Pilgrim is.

612
00:39:48,524 --> 00:39:53,563
Rym: I'll note that it was a Nominated for two Eisner Awards two Eagle Awards.

613
00:39:53,603 --> 00:39:54,486
Rym: it didn't win any of these.

614
00:39:54,566 --> 00:39:55,690
Rym: it was nominated for all of them.

615
00:39:56,396 --> 00:40:03,457
Rym: O'Malley won the Outstanding Canadian comic book cartoonist award and The dog right award.

616
00:40:03,517 --> 00:40:05,263
Rym: Yeah for best emerging talent.

617
00:40:05,343 --> 00:40:10,101
Scott: If you go to the official Scott Pilgrim website I'm sure there are some free previews of Scott Pilgrim.

618
00:40:10,181 --> 00:40:11,285
Scott: so you can read some.

619
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:22,709
Scott: Scott Pilgrim before You know buying Scott Pilgrim and then after you decide that you like it because you're not gonna come to any other conclusion You're gonna go to the store and buy all three volumes that are out right now.

620
00:40:23,243 --> 00:40:24,955
Rym: Yeah now don't make the mistake.

621
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:25,558
Rym: I did cuz.

622
00:40:25,899 --> 00:40:29,211
Rym: for some reason there seemed to be a lot more copies of three around than there are of Two.

623
00:40:29,695 --> 00:40:32,030
Rym: so I had one and I didn't see two anywhere.

624
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,054
Rym: But I saw three.

625
00:40:33,074 --> 00:40:36,607
Rym: so I bought it and it sat there and I couldn't.

626
00:40:36,647 --> 00:40:41,570
Rym: I didn't have two Available and I kept saying I'll just read one page of three and put it down.

627
00:40:42,431 --> 00:40:47,350
Rym: I'll just read one more page and I read the whole thing before I read two and it didn't make any sense.

628
00:40:49,898 --> 00:40:53,230
Scott: All right Cinecon.

629
00:40:58,082 --> 00:41:04,809
Rym: So we're pretty much gonna wrap this up because we do have to prepare for Cinecon which again will be going to this weekend October 6th 7th and 8th.

630
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,109
Rym: I promise I won't plug it anymore because I don't need to.

631
00:41:08,169 --> 00:41:08,671
Rym: we're going.

632
00:41:08,811 --> 00:41:09,293
Rym: it's coming.

633
00:41:09,494 --> 00:41:10,638
Rym: It's done tomorrow.

634
00:41:10,698 --> 00:41:11,360
Scott: clown pistols.

635
00:41:11,962 --> 00:41:13,126
Rym: Yeah, clown pistols.

636
00:41:13,989 --> 00:41:14,872
Emily: I'm sad.

637
00:41:14,892 --> 00:41:20,574
Emily: I didn't get to talk about my movie to start your own podcast Suck.

638
00:41:22,101 --> 00:41:26,514
Scott: I didn't get to talk about the boob sword or the boobs or wait a minute.

639
00:41:26,574 --> 00:41:27,537
Rym: Wait a minute.

640
00:41:27,557 --> 00:41:30,810
Scott: There's a boob So I can't say anything.

641
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:32,076
Emily: We've run out of time.

642
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:32,900
Emily: It's impossible.

643
00:41:33,281 --> 00:41:45,153
Emily: what I really wanted to say though is it was funny because I was on the forums after I did the show last time and I was Incredibly amazed because people are like that Emily lady should come back on.

644
00:41:45,173 --> 00:41:45,615
Rym: I was like.

645
00:41:45,695 --> 00:41:47,240
Rym: I have never blessed so hard.

646
00:41:47,521 --> 00:41:48,286
Rym: We got more.

647
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:54,980
Emily: I can't be back about Emily being on the show I was like and you said I had an accent which I thought was funny.

648
00:41:55,382 --> 00:41:56,085
Rym: Well, you kind of do.

649
00:41:56,507 --> 00:41:58,055
Rym: it seems to be more pronounced when you use.

650
00:41:58,135 --> 00:41:59,140
Scott: I don't think you have an accent.

651
00:42:00,501 --> 00:42:02,809
Scott: Sometimes you don't talk normally like you're right now.

652
00:42:02,849 --> 00:42:05,940
Scott: You're talking and like kind of like the cute voice intentionally.

653
00:42:06,242 --> 00:42:06,724
Emily: No, I'm not.

654
00:42:06,805 --> 00:42:09,540
Emily: Well, that was that was when I was talking normally.

655
00:42:11,961 --> 00:42:13,286
Emily: That's like cute small voice.

656
00:42:13,648 --> 00:42:19,860
Emily: people say I have a different voice when I talk in Japanese - My voice gets higher, which I think is funny.

657
00:42:20,469 --> 00:42:26,748
Rym: Anyway, yeah We're going to have Emily on the show in the future because many of you have expressed interest in a couple of topics and I'm going to Finland.

658
00:42:26,769 --> 00:42:48,305
Rym: so Finland Finland the land full of They something something All right From Japan.

659
00:42:48,385 --> 00:42:51,279
Rym: that is some way moving pictures on a screen.

660
00:42:52,244 --> 00:43:00,675
Rym: So if you have questions about Emily in Japan Yes questions questions about living in Japan because the thing is like.

661
00:43:00,715 --> 00:43:06,459
Emily: I said, I tried to record stuff before But I think I couldn't do a podcast, you know, I tried to do it.

662
00:43:06,841 --> 00:43:16,820
Emily: It just felt and none of us didn't have any energy at all And so I can't just sit here Especially when these two are around and talk about things that they are not able to have input on.

663
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,786
Emily: So it's even though I want to talk about.

664
00:43:18,827 --> 00:43:20,693
Emily: these three movies are actually four.

665
00:43:21,154 --> 00:43:21,816
Emily: No, no, no, no.

666
00:43:21,917 --> 00:43:26,812
Emily: five movies No, six six movies five is right out.

667
00:43:27,093 --> 00:43:31,106
Emily: No anyway, um, I Wanted to talk about these these films.

668
00:43:31,186 --> 00:43:33,173
Emily: I saw they haven't seen them yet.

669
00:43:33,293 --> 00:43:34,558
Emily: So on one hand.

670
00:43:34,638 --> 00:43:42,689
Emily: I'm like, haha I know something you don't know but on the other hand, it doesn't make the show this this woman You would not believe when full metal.

671
00:43:42,809 --> 00:43:43,633
Rym: Oh, that was great.

672
00:43:43,653 --> 00:43:44,115
Rym: I was like.

673
00:43:44,155 --> 00:43:45,200
Emily: you have no idea.

674
00:43:47,281 --> 00:43:49,088
Rym: Thing of if someone sees something.

675
00:43:49,128 --> 00:43:52,580
Rym: before someone say the only thing you can say is you have no idea.

676
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,745
Scott: Yeah, oh my god.

677
00:43:54,766 --> 00:43:55,669
Scott: You have no idea.

678
00:43:55,729 --> 00:43:56,291
Scott: Holy crap.

679
00:43:56,311 --> 00:44:02,979
Rym: So of course because Emily understands Japanese She was watching Full Metal Alchemist almost a week ahead of all of us.

680
00:44:03,602 --> 00:44:05,489
Rym: So every week I get a phone call.

681
00:44:05,951 --> 00:44:06,734
Rym: you have no idea.

682
00:44:06,754 --> 00:44:08,320
Rym: I'm like, yeah, I have no idea.

683
00:44:09,143 --> 00:44:10,972
Rym: I get it son of a bitch.

684
00:44:10,992 --> 00:44:18,439
Rym: I Was tempted to rosh bras, but that doesn't work so well because I only understand the useless parts of the language.

685
00:44:19,442 --> 00:44:21,408
Scott: I also understand all of the useless parts.

686
00:44:21,729 --> 00:44:26,205
Emily: I'm also happy cuz my comics cost half as much or less True.

687
00:44:26,225 --> 00:44:27,114
Emily: I bought.

688
00:44:27,276 --> 00:44:30,375
Rym: I bought Eva comic Scott and I have talked about this on the show before.

689
00:44:30,415 --> 00:44:31,320
Rym: if we could afford.

690
00:44:31,461 --> 00:44:32,005
Rym: Well one.

691
00:44:32,045 --> 00:44:35,444
Rym: if we could read Japanese if I could read I would buy so much manga.

692
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:43,153
Emily: I would oh It's kind of like me me when I was in Japan.

693
00:44:43,193 --> 00:44:46,446
Emily: I was like, oh I get the Discount at the bookstore.

694
00:44:46,506 --> 00:44:54,640
Rym: So I'm gonna buy all these models actually like, you know There would be a pile of every piece of gecky guy in the world in this house.

695
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:10,359
Scott: I would go like there's so many manga that I'd like can't read now and aren't gonna be out here for years like 20th-century boys and other stuff and like they're like 30 plus volume relations are Yeah, I don't go for that.

696
00:45:11,803 --> 00:45:14,073
Rym: You read almost all of Death Note scans lated.

697
00:45:14,173 --> 00:45:15,679
Scott: Yeah, but it wasn't so great.

698
00:45:16,341 --> 00:45:18,227
Rym: Yeah, it was you raved about it every day.

699
00:45:18,287 --> 00:45:20,733
Emily: The funniest thing is some of the translators.

700
00:45:20,934 --> 00:45:23,060
Rym: you got caught saying something that wasn't fully true.

701
00:45:25,983 --> 00:45:39,260
Emily: This this might sound kind of you know You know But some of the scans laters they I don't know if they have English as a second language or what but it's kind of hard.

702
00:45:39,521 --> 00:45:43,320
Emily: Understand some of the dialogue on some some of these translations.

703
00:45:43,926 --> 00:45:55,459
Emily: It's almost more straightforward If you'll know Japanese to just buy the one dollar comic off the internet or off a book off if you live in a city And and read that instead It's a learning experience.

704
00:45:56,344 --> 00:46:14,709
Rym: So anyway, come to Cinecon, especially if you're Australian And if you have questions for Emily about Japan anime in Japan Japanese culture Upcoming live-action adaptations of anime or Anything along those lines post them in the forums.

705
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:15,211
Rym: We'll do.

Rym: so get them in quickly and There will probably be a recording of me being shot in the face with a clown pistol tomorrow.

708
00:46:25,501 --> 00:46:27,449
Scott: I also got shot in the face with the clown pistol.

709
00:46:27,529 --> 00:46:35,420
Rym: Yes, but slightly after me slightly after Yeah, and also I don't think as much of the powder went in your goddamn eyes cuz I saw it coming a mile away.
