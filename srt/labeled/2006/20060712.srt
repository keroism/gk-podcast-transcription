1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,122
Rym: It's Wednesday July 12th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:14,162 --> 00:00:16,730
Rym: We speak at great length about our experiences at ConnectiCon.

3
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,467
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:22,152 --> 00:00:30,377
Rym: So uh I grew up in a place where tornadoes were commonplace Kansas Texas, Michigan, Oklahoma.

5
00:00:30,658 --> 00:00:36,665
Rym: lots of tornadoes to the point that I mean tornadoes and thunderstorms And we just didn't really care because they tended to follow the roads.

6
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:50,429
Rym: and not too much damage Not too many tornadoes in New York, Connecticut, I mean there may be one every couple years, but not too many Yeah, which I found funny because when there was like a tornado watch and people in my work were all a tornado.

7
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:53,479
Rym: oh No, what do we do?

8
00:00:54,002 --> 00:00:55,770
Rym: and I was like why do you sit in your basement?

9
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,039
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty much what you do.

10
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,488
Scott: tornado warning in the basement.

11
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:11,901
Rym: But it was gone out of the basement despite the fact that so many tornadoes and storms that come through and I grew up with No tornado had ever Affected my life because the where I grew up tornadoes were common.

12
00:01:11,961 --> 00:01:16,976
Rym: so everything was kind of designed in a way that Tornadoes really didn't affect your daily life.

13
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:25,682
Rym: if a tornado came through it didn't knock the power out it didn't do anything It just kind of went through disappeared knocks a couple trees down everyone on with their lives.

14
00:01:26,444 --> 00:01:31,587
Rym: It took me today five hours to get home from work.

15
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:48,509
Rym: For five hours I was sitting in my car because a tornado momentarily ripped through some parts of downstate, New York which Crippled the entire road infrastructure of New York City to the point that no one could leave the city.

16
00:01:49,031 --> 00:01:51,539
Rym: Every road going north was closed.

17
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:53,967
Rym: not only were they closed, but I got.

18
00:01:54,007 --> 00:02:01,280
Rym: I was driving home I left work early, and I'm driving and then Suddenly traffic is stopped up ahead, and there's no egg.

19
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,510
Rym: There's an exit like a mile past this stop, so all right I figured this prime accident.

20
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:11,109
Rym: I'll get off on this exit right there that I can practically see the exit because it's right there.

21
00:02:12,604 --> 00:02:19,707
Rym: and No, no traffic didn't move at all as in it Just didn't move for two hours couldn't you go in the median and get?

22
00:02:19,727 --> 00:02:20,892
Rym: there's no median It's the.

23
00:02:21,033 --> 00:02:22,619
Rym: it's a parkway in New York City.

24
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,145
Rym: There's a giant cement divider.

25
00:02:24,406 --> 00:02:25,310
Rym: the lanes were narrow.

26
00:02:25,631 --> 00:02:32,846
Scott: It was brick wall lane lane brick wall, haha You couldn't put the tire on the grass or anything.

27
00:02:32,906 --> 00:02:33,430
Rym: no grass.

28
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:39,449
Rym: Oh, I turned my car off and sat there listening to podcasts and reading a nancy boys for two hours.

29
00:02:39,852 --> 00:02:44,757
Scott: Uh-huh, then I spent the next three hours, and if I was stuck in there I probably could have finished a stupid lensman book.

30
00:02:45,179 --> 00:02:46,724
Scott: that isn't really so stupid.

31
00:02:46,844 --> 00:02:50,696
Rym: three hours trying to get home I eventually got home.

32
00:02:50,857 --> 00:02:51,298
Rym: It sucked.

33
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:57,337
Rym: so basically my entire day consisted of work Driving podcast soon-to-be sleep.

34
00:02:57,798 --> 00:02:59,744
Scott: Yeah, you know that's the thing is in New York.

35
00:03:00,165 --> 00:03:00,927
Scott: You know it's sort of.

36
00:03:01,588 --> 00:03:05,730
Scott: it's like this up It's like a triangle with the pointy bit at the bottom and then New York City.

37
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:15,110
Scott: So everyone's trying to get from this is crammed into the bottom of the pointy part of a triangle and then Spreading out to this wide part of a triangle.

38
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:22,334
Scott: But there's really only like three or four roads that go north and like two of them to go northeast which aren't so useful for us.

39
00:03:23,006 --> 00:03:32,143
Scott: so Since it's still kind of narrow if a tornado goes horizontal perpendicular to those roads Which it did along 287 then there's really difficult to go north.

40
00:03:34,111 --> 00:03:42,296
Rym: and then I called Scott and we're going back and forth trying to figure out how I can get home since he's sitting there with Google Maps being my navigator and Every road was closed.

41
00:03:42,357 --> 00:03:45,226
Rym: It was like 684. now something's crazy.

42
00:03:45,286 --> 00:03:47,172
Rym: It's closed 84.

43
00:03:47,172 --> 00:03:49,038
Rym: Oh shit truck exploded on it.

44
00:03:49,218 --> 00:03:52,950
Rym: Yeah, which is not a joke a sewage truck exploded.

45
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:58,004
Rym: Then the driver drove the truck away, and they eventually caught him somewhere in Connecticut.

46
00:03:58,044 --> 00:04:00,130
Scott: I thought they he drove it away.

47
00:04:00,472 --> 00:04:04,049
Rym: Well, it's just like it broke and spilled it everywhere, and he didn't want to deal with.

48
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,492
Scott: oh So he unhitched the trailer, and he drove his truck away I think.

49
00:04:07,532 --> 00:04:10,350
Rym: so they caught him at some diner a rest stop or something okay?

50
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:14,270
Scott: Cuz I mean it's one thing if he was dragging or exploded sewage truck around.

51
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,798
Scott: But it's like your trailer explodes.

52
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,605
Scott: you just unhitch your truck and keep going.

53
00:04:18,785 --> 00:04:22,290
Rym: that's different yeah, but anyway I'm not gonna bore you with the details of that.

54
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:26,023
Rym: Maybe I'll talk about it on a Thursday or something when it's on the national news.

55
00:04:26,043 --> 00:04:33,859
Rym: go to Google News and search in New York Talk about my experiences seeing in a car for five hours And all the fun.

56
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,332
Rym: I had there yep Tell.

57
00:04:36,352 --> 00:04:38,985
Rym: the longer went on the less clothed that I was.

58
00:04:39,005 --> 00:04:43,379
Rym: no Like it started out like I'm were there police everywhere?

59
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,610
Scott: there were police everywhere, so why would you take your clothes?

60
00:04:47,052 --> 00:04:48,457
Rym: Because I was really hot.

61
00:04:48,617 --> 00:04:51,026
Scott: now all right you have no air condition didn't matter.

62
00:04:51,106 --> 00:04:53,716
Rym: even if the air conditioning works There's no way I could have used it.

63
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:57,509
Rym: sitting stopped like that with air conditioning for that long We just overheat the car.

64
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:02,846
Rym: You know many cars overheated caught fire or just broke sitting there for all those hours.

65
00:05:02,906 --> 00:05:05,145
Rym: cuz idiots wouldn't just turn them off their AC.

66
00:05:06,212 --> 00:05:08,169
Rym: Sit in a parked car with the AC for two hours.

67
00:05:08,532 --> 00:05:10,870
Scott: Well, you can't not for two hours, but for a little while again.

68
00:05:11,092 --> 00:05:12,204
Scott: Yeah, maybe like 20 minutes.

69
00:05:12,891 --> 00:05:23,372
Rym: But the nice benefit of all this is once I got past Tarrytown where the real damage was There was not a car on the road and not a cop on the road because all the cops were dealing with the crisis down South.

70
00:05:23,855 --> 00:05:26,170
Scott: well, he's the state cops which are the man the local cops.

71
00:05:26,713 --> 00:05:27,960
Rym: It was all local cops.

72
00:05:28,503 --> 00:05:29,690
Rym: I didn't see a single state cop.

73
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:36,435
Rym: Well, those are the ones you got to worry about now because they were busy dealing with other more important disasters like on Route 6 And 202 and all that area.

74
00:05:36,496 --> 00:05:40,349
Rym: uh-huh, so I went pretty much a hundred miles an hour the rest of the way home.

75
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:44,001
Rym: It was real fun because there was no one on the road.

76
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:46,448
Rym: no no stoplights because they were all broken.

77
00:05:46,468 --> 00:05:48,392
Scott: no Danger.

78
00:05:48,592 --> 00:05:49,817
Rym: no because there's no traffic.

79
00:05:50,057 --> 00:05:50,639
Rym: There were no lights.

80
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:51,502
Rym: There was no one.

81
00:05:51,783 --> 00:05:52,766
Rym: the road was empty.

82
00:05:52,787 --> 00:05:53,710
Rym: It was just me.

83
00:05:54,151 --> 00:05:56,057
Rym: I didn't see another car for 20 minutes.

84
00:05:56,257 --> 00:05:56,819
Scott: Uh-huh.

85
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,922
Rym: It was awesome.

86
00:05:58,344 --> 00:06:00,230
Rym: I was like I was in my own personal rally race.

87
00:06:01,331 --> 00:06:01,592
Scott: Great.

88
00:06:02,014 --> 00:06:02,255
Rym: All right.

89
00:06:02,356 --> 00:06:05,269
Rym: Anyway, once again, I won't bore you with all the details of that.

90
00:06:05,753 --> 00:06:13,058
Scott: Maybe I'll do a minute by minute accounting of it someday Someday hopefully a long time from now When we don't have to sit around going.

91
00:06:13,621 --> 00:06:15,469
Scott: so I was sitting in the car not doing anything.

92
00:06:16,052 --> 00:06:17,438
Scott: I was sitting in the car not doing anything.

93
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:20,329
Scott: Yeah, I was sitting in the car still not doing anything.

94
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:28,550
Rym: All right, so it's anime day and instead of a normal new well anime manga comics day, but there's no manga in comics.

95
00:06:28,871 --> 00:06:32,706
Rym: Well, yeah, it's anime manga comics day, but we're talking mostly about anime today.

96
00:06:32,746 --> 00:06:33,650
Rym: So I'll call it anime day.

97
00:06:33,992 --> 00:06:45,249
Rym: Hmm, but yeah for the benefit of our new listeners We should call it the actual thing because if you are a new listener and you're listening right now just for the ConnectiCon Feedback slash coverage keep in mind that we go four nights a week.

98
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:48,518
Rym: Mondays are science and tech Linux computers all that.

99
00:06:48,859 --> 00:06:51,125
Rym: Tuesdays are gaming of all kinds.

100
00:06:51,546 --> 00:06:53,250
Rym: Thursdays are anything geeky.

101
00:06:53,972 --> 00:06:55,248
Rym: Wednesdays are obviously anime.

102
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,599
Scott: yep, and You know, that's how it goes.

103
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:06,430
Rym: Yeah, but instead of a normal news I have kind of a generic bit of talking to do mostly about anime world order.

104
00:07:07,872 --> 00:07:10,240
Rym: Now we sent them a an audio feedback.

105
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,765
Scott: Oh, I know we talked about them so much.

106
00:07:11,786 --> 00:07:13,050
Scott: Do you want to play their promo?

107
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,437
Scott: We've never played a promo before.

108
00:07:14,678 --> 00:07:16,710
Rym: Yeah, I think I'll add a promo in tonight.

109
00:07:17,053 --> 00:07:18,690
Rym: I'm not sure how to deal with promos yet.

110
00:07:19,011 --> 00:07:24,351
Scott: I think we just take it and we'll put it after the things of the day and before the main bit just paste it in There.

111
00:07:24,753 --> 00:07:28,010
Rym: yeah, either that or I'll stick them at the end and is good, right?

112
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:28,553
Rym: We'll try.

113
00:07:28,593 --> 00:07:33,740
Rym: we'll try because the thing is at least keep in mind if we play a promo That means that we're in some way endorsing it.

114
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,090
Rym: We won't just play a promo because someone else played our promo.

115
00:07:36,234 --> 00:07:36,689
Scott: That's right.

116
00:07:36,911 --> 00:07:44,933
Rym: Now we're gonna play the anime world order one because while we disagree on almost every fandom topic There is about anime.

117
00:07:44,953 --> 00:07:48,463
Scott: Oh, no, not everything but we well we're.

118
00:07:48,804 --> 00:07:51,756
Rym: we have this mutual kind of respect cuz they're really cool guys And a girl.

119
00:07:52,019 --> 00:08:06,292
Rym: we just disagree with them a lot Yeah, but they did one our audio feedback which was real good on their previous episode episode 26 And if you like what we say now, you should probably listen to that special episode, but more importantly they reviewed Md.

120
00:08:06,413 --> 00:08:06,915
Rym: Geist.

121
00:08:07,217 --> 00:08:17,125
Rym: Yeah, and Not only was that the best segment ever done on anime world order But that was one of the funniest things I've ever heard on a podcast.

122
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:25,448
Rym: I Was also Roveling mightily cuz I had seen like the first half hour of MD guys not even like the first 20 minutes.

123
00:08:25,869 --> 00:08:28,863
Scott: I May or may not have seen MD guys.

124
00:08:28,924 --> 00:08:31,750
Scott: if I had seen it I didn't remember any of it.

125
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:38,799
Scott: But I have seen and heard of MD guys like I've seen the box and I've heard of the show Like we.

126
00:08:38,881 --> 00:08:39,730
Rym: I rented it from blood.

127
00:08:39,831 --> 00:08:48,107
Rym: I knew it was bad and me and my brother watched in a while and we were just like wow This is crap and we turned it off and I didn't know that it ended that way.

128
00:08:48,148 --> 00:08:51,360
Rym: you guys My god, it's still.

129
00:08:51,481 --> 00:08:53,790
Scott: it's not as bad as great the digital target.

130
00:08:54,031 --> 00:08:56,842
Rym: No, cuz I don't think MD guys is bad as an unwatchable.

131
00:08:56,882 --> 00:09:00,035
Rym: I think it's bad as an awesome I don't know.

132
00:09:00,235 --> 00:09:02,303
Rym: just if anything listen to that review.

133
00:09:02,645 --> 00:09:13,210
Rym: if you even if you hate anime You're just listening to today because you're one of those vivacious ravenous GeekNights fans and you Listen to the anime roller or to review of MD guys.

134
00:09:13,873 --> 00:09:17,250
Scott: Yeah, it was two episodes ago because they just released an episode today.

135
00:09:17,411 --> 00:09:18,559
Rym: Y'all link to it episode 26.

137
00:09:33,835 --> 00:09:50,669
Scott: and yeah, you know in the Oscars when people say I'd like to thank the Academy Well, the Academy is really just a bunch of movie people actors directors Executives producers writers special effects guys all that sort of stuff musicians.

138
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,237
Rym: now They're the ones who decide who actually wins those things.

139
00:09:53,257 --> 00:09:55,786
Scott: Yeah, they nominate and vote on Oscars.

140
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:56,930
Scott: That's what the Academy is.

141
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:17,590
Scott: Well, they've decided to a. they used to be that the Academy was like more and more exclusive and getting smaller but they've decided reason in recent years that they're going to a grow the Academy by about 30 members a year and Also when people retire and or die they will replace them as well.

142
00:10:18,213 --> 00:10:28,290
Scott: Finally now most of the people in the Academy are from the US But they do have many international people and they have also raised the standards of quality.

Scott: now they actually only pick the best people from the list even if they met the qualifications.

145
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:44,612
Scott: and Our good friend from Japan Miyazaki.

146
00:10:44,934 --> 00:10:48,185
Rym: we use our good friend in the royal we sense not in the.

147
00:10:48,245 --> 00:10:49,269
Rym: we know the dude since.

148
00:10:49,369 --> 00:10:52,861
Scott: no He don't know me as Aki, but if we did wouldn't we be awesome.

149
00:10:53,102 --> 00:10:54,065
Rym: Oh, yes quite quite.

150
00:10:54,206 --> 00:10:56,937
Scott: Yeah, we know him Yeah of him.

151
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,430
Rym: He came over and used my bathroom.

152
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:11,230
Scott: Yeah, so Miyazaki has been invited to the Academy which means that There is a chance because generally he's one of the animators in the Academy.

153
00:11:11,451 --> 00:11:13,416
Scott: So usually they have more.

154
00:11:13,436 --> 00:11:21,589
Scott: I think they have it's kind of a secret, but they definitely have more push in you know Nominating works of animation and voting on them.

155
00:11:22,071 --> 00:11:29,799
Scott: So hopefully he can put in some sort of influence and maybe there will be some more Anime Oscars in the future in the very least.

156
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:38,119
Rym: I'm just very happy that the Academy and these people have decided to Recognize the vast vast Talent that is Miyazaki.

157
00:11:38,501 --> 00:11:41,954
Scott: Yeah now if only they would get you know Cuz I mean some of the.

158
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:54,250
Scott: there are other animators in Japan besides Miyazaki who are better than some animators in the Academy Not to say that animators in the Academy besides Miyazaki are bad because I'm sure there are a jillion great ones there.

159
00:11:54,772 --> 00:11:59,730
Scott: But you know to have one guy represent all the greatness that is over there.

160
00:12:00,031 --> 00:12:03,730
Scott: I mean I can think of at least three or four more guys who need to be brought over.

161
00:12:04,374 --> 00:12:06,810
Scott: I got some guys have been brought over in their day.

162
00:12:07,171 --> 00:12:09,439
Rym: I can think of some guys who shouldn't be brought over to.

163
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:14,125
Scott: oh I can think of plenty of those as well, so There you have it.

164
00:12:15,912 --> 00:12:19,009
Rym: So you want to hear people talk about Japanese cartoons, you know.

165
00:12:20,153 --> 00:12:22,900
Rym: But you think the other anime podcasters just aren't nerdy enough.

166
00:12:23,341 --> 00:12:37,827
Rym: sounds like you need to join forces with the anime world order Where each week three self-proclaimed experts offer you reviews of titles both new and classic news and commentary Rants convention reports interviews with fandom and some hentai and yaoi.

213
00:16:14,213 --> 00:16:29,416
Rym: the thing was it was like a black power rally, but it was nerd power and he gave a Fiery burn the frat houses down speech to a screaming crowd of nerds and then proceeded to sing and it was bad ass Bad ass indeed.

214
00:16:29,998 --> 00:16:30,299
Scott: Hence.

215
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:32,266
Scott: You should go get these torrents now.

216
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:35,990
Rym: Scott had a new thing of the day So I've countered that with an old thing of the day.

217
00:16:36,492 --> 00:16:45,210
Rym: This is something that way back we were doing kind of retro things of the day, you know things like coin bad Dinner today and lobster magnet.

218
00:16:47,051 --> 00:16:56,139
Rym: That had been forgotten or unknown to many of the younger people online and this isn't that old but it is quite well known among most people.

219
00:16:56,179 --> 00:17:03,003
Rym: but I have a feeling some people might have missed it and The fact that I forgot to bring it up during our retro weeks was a crime.

220
00:17:03,183 --> 00:17:05,470
Scott: Yeah, this one was sort of under the radar.

221
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:12,498
Scott: I mean I had seen it once after Rym showed it to me and then he mentioned it and I was like I Kinda remember, I don't know maybe.

222
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:15,310
Scott: and then he showed it to me and I was like, oh, yeah that thing that I saw once.

223
00:17:15,611 --> 00:17:18,060
Rym: Yeah, because someone in the forums was like how come you didn't do dr.

224
00:17:19,003 --> 00:17:19,646
Rym: Tran?

225
00:17:19,988 --> 00:17:25,871
Rym: and I said Because I totally forgot and I'll do it tomorrow Dr.

226
00:17:25,891 --> 00:17:28,196
Rym: Tran, I don't want to ruin what dr.

227
00:17:28,237 --> 00:17:30,423
Rym: Tran is just go to the link and watch it.

228
00:17:30,463 --> 00:17:31,265
Rym: But dr.

229
00:17:31,325 --> 00:17:32,829
Rym: Tran is a real doctor.

230
00:17:33,691 --> 00:17:36,646
Rym: That's all I got to say about that a kick-ass doctor.

231
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:36,747
Scott: What?

232
00:17:38,113 --> 00:17:41,166
Scott: Well, he has a PhD and kicking your ass, who are you?

233
00:17:41,266 --> 00:17:41,989
Rym: what is going on?

234
00:17:42,793 --> 00:17:43,175
Scott: Alright.

235
00:17:43,276 --> 00:17:43,477
Scott: Alright.

236
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:52,430
Rym: Alright, so I without further ado We spent the previous Saturday at Connecticut in the Connecticut Convention Center in Hartford, Connecticut.

237
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:54,819
Scott: Hartford is the capital of Connecticut.

238
00:17:54,879 --> 00:18:04,750
Rym: for you people who do not know about small states Hartford is also as far as I can tell Nothing, but a convention center surrounded by an industrial and commercial zone.

239
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:10,069
Scott: You you were far away from the actual city of Hartford which is a moderate city.

240
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,450
Rym: Ah, so the convention center is just in the middle of nowhere.

241
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:16,750
Scott: Yeah, the convention center is on like the edge of the city where the industrial stuff is.

242
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:20,023
Scott: It's not in the middle of the city where the tall tall buildings are.

243
00:18:20,685 --> 00:18:45,521
Scott: But yeah, it's sort of like Think of it as a mini Albany, you know It's got a lot of state buildings in it and only like a couple businesses not really any major super headquarters You know, I mean the super major headquarters that are Near Hartford are in like the outskirts like my dad works at like the ultra super campus of the Cigna insurance Company which is way out in the middle of the woods.

244
00:18:45,581 --> 00:18:47,650
Scott: It's not in a big tall building in the city.

245
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:49,693
Scott: So, you know a Hartford it.

246
00:18:49,854 --> 00:18:53,480
Scott: the city itself is kind of not the biggest most amazing.

247
00:18:53,981 --> 00:19:13,820
Scott: It's actually got quite a West Hartford or kind of you know suburb II and then East Hartford is kind of slummy Yep, but anyway, we were at Connecticut and Connecticut which is not really an anime convention It's more of a webcomic convention.

248
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:15,707
Scott: What does it actually say?

249
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,854
Scott: Cuz it says Connecticut.

250
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:22,930
Scott: well, no, it said on the banner they like listed all the things that the con has.

251
00:19:23,351 --> 00:19:23,974
Rym: Well, the thing is it.

252
00:19:24,516 --> 00:19:33,830
Rym: it plays out like an anime con because anime cons Are tend to be very general nowadays and very broad and it had all the trappings of an anime con.

253
00:19:34,211 --> 00:19:36,842
Rym: The same kind of people went that the cosplayers.

254
00:19:36,862 --> 00:19:39,010
Rym: it had the masquerade the AMV contest.

255
00:19:39,633 --> 00:19:40,919
Rym: It felt like an anime con.

256
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:47,130
Rym: It did not feel like any of the other kinds of cons Mm-hmm, but the one thing it had going for it was that it had gaming.

257
00:19:47,531 --> 00:19:50,299
Rym: In fact, it had better gaming than a lot of gaming cons.

258
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:54,130
Rym: I've been to which was quite surprising and welcome.

259
00:19:54,852 --> 00:20:04,008
Scott: Yeah, it definitely had better gaming than anime next which is surprising cuz you know anime next is a bigger convention than Connecticut at least as far as I could tell.

260
00:20:04,551 --> 00:20:09,930
Rym: Yeah, but anyway, we actually talked about the gaming at Connecticut yesterday on our gaming podcast night.

261
00:20:10,272 --> 00:20:15,295
Scott: So we're just gonna go over what went down at Connecticut in Chronological order.

262
00:20:15,436 --> 00:20:18,230
Scott: Yep, more or less and we'll leave out the gaming parts.

263
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,429
Scott: I'll pretty much say this is the time when I played the game.

264
00:20:20,771 --> 00:20:29,650
Rym: We might make a little nods to it because I do want to say one That the gaming at Connecticut for anyone who was listening today just because of our report was fantastic.

265
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:35,008
Rym: It was very well done and I give mad props to everyone involved in the gaming at this convention Mm-hmm.

266
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:43,394
Rym: However in regards to the rest of the convention despite anything we say I want to say right now that Connecticut was by no means A bad convention.

267
00:20:43,756 --> 00:20:46,143
Rym: We've only been to one bad convention.

268
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:50,364
Scott: That was Ohio con - yeah Pretty sure we went to Ohio con number two.

269
00:20:50,505 --> 00:21:03,250
Scott: And yeah Ohio con - had great moments for us like a Mario Yeah, and it's like a lot of Nintendo related things the midget and the prostitute in the prostitute playing settlers of guitar.

270
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:07,054
Scott: but the con itself was Bad.

271
00:21:07,074 --> 00:21:09,081
Rym: now ConnectiCon was not bad.

272
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,610
Rym: don't at any point think that we were saying it's bad.

273
00:21:11,731 --> 00:21:13,148
Rym: We went we had a good time.

274
00:21:13,671 --> 00:21:19,129
Rym: But as it'll be apparent while we talk about ConnectiCon that it does a lot of things.

275
00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:28,341
Rym: well But it does a lot of things Not as well as it could which any one of them or a few of them in and of themselves would have been fine But add it up.

276
00:21:28,401 --> 00:21:35,329
Rym: They really Detract from the experience a lot and we I guess we mean this more as constructive criticism than anything.

277
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:37,636
Scott: Yeah Here's my my two explanations.

278
00:21:37,716 --> 00:21:42,490
Scott: It's sort of like it's not down to the level where it's like a smelly turd.

279
00:21:43,111 --> 00:21:53,508
Scott: It's sort of like an unpolished gemstone and you're sitting there going polish it polish it polish it polish it polish it polish it Fix it fix it fix it fix it fix it fix it exactly exactly.

280
00:21:54,251 --> 00:22:01,329
Scott: and it's also sort of like if you're watching someone play Mario 1 and they run into the first Goomba and Then you watch him and they do it again.

281
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:05,967
Scott: Or you're watching someone play Tetris and they keep putting blocks in suboptimal places.

282
00:22:05,987 --> 00:22:06,609
Scott: You're just going.

283
00:22:06,629 --> 00:22:09,539
Scott: ah Why aren't you playing a perfect game?

284
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,805
Scott: I could play a perfect game.

285
00:22:11,066 --> 00:22:13,256
Scott: Ah, so The con.

286
00:22:13,557 --> 00:22:23,740
Scott: while not so bad that it was a terrible convention Some of the parts of the convention were screwed up in certain ways Which we'll get to the specifics as we go on now.

287
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,270
Scott: some of them we could feel that we could have fixed.

288
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:37,809
Rym: Yeah, most mainly because I mean we go to so many conventions or we you know staff or panelists and so many conventions that I guess ConnectiCon had problems with things that almost every other major con solved a long time ago.

289
00:22:38,211 --> 00:22:41,630
Rym: Yep, and they're simple things that would be almost trivial to fix.

290
00:22:41,831 --> 00:22:46,368
Rym: I mean one dude in two minutes could have fixed a lot of the problems they had.

291
00:22:46,508 --> 00:22:46,950
Scott: That's true.

292
00:22:47,352 --> 00:22:49,642
Rym: But we'll get to that and I just it was a good cut.

293
00:22:49,662 --> 00:22:51,289
Scott: a lot of it was lack of foresight.

294
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:56,325
Rym: ConnectiCon has a lot of potential and I think if they polish it then it can.

295
00:22:56,586 --> 00:22:57,850
Rym: it can be a fantastic con.

296
00:22:58,071 --> 00:22:58,757
Scott: Yep, I agree.

297
00:22:58,878 --> 00:22:59,261
Scott: First off.

298
00:22:59,361 --> 00:23:13,486
Rym: I was gonna go Friday Okay, and because I accidentally got the day off work And the only reason I didn't because actually our friend we're gonna go meet our friend Yuko There and hang out at her table and her boyfriend Brian was also cool.

299
00:23:13,868 --> 00:23:15,410
Rym: and then on Saturday We're gonna meet our friend cat.

300
00:23:15,571 --> 00:23:17,479
Rym: So we had reasons to go other than just the con.

301
00:23:18,102 --> 00:23:24,165
Rym: and the only reason I didn't go Friday Was that my car doesn't have air and conditioning and it was real hot outside.

302
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:25,610
Scott: I think that's a good reason.

303
00:23:25,991 --> 00:23:30,170
Rym: Yeah that and I didn't actually technically have a place to stay at the con.

304
00:23:31,151 --> 00:23:41,049
Rym: So while I would have loved to just bum with someone I Would have been interesting because it's been a long time since I went to a convention without having a hotel room lined up

305
00:23:41,431 --> 00:23:46,130
Scott: Yeah, and he while you might have been a little bum with someone you might have been on a floor or who knows

306
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:54,907
Rym: Yeah, plus actually I had a really good day Friday that involved things I shouldn't talk about on the air because they were illegal but some urban exploration that was most excellent,

307
00:23:55,248 --> 00:23:55,630
Scott: whatever.

308
00:23:56,332 --> 00:24:03,030
Rym: Anyway, so Saturday morning we get up and we'd start driving drive drive drive drive drive completely uneventful.

309
00:24:03,532 --> 00:24:06,645
Rym: We get there around what we didn't get lost at all.

310
00:24:06,785 --> 00:24:07,368
Scott: We just went up.

311
00:24:07,408 --> 00:24:07,790
Scott: There it is.

312
00:24:07,891 --> 00:24:08,283
Scott: We went in.

313
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:16,053
Rym: yeah, because one thing that Connecticut has going forward is that the Connecticut Convention Center is right off of i-84 and 91.

314
00:24:16,053 --> 00:24:17,417
Scott: you can't miss it.

315
00:24:17,478 --> 00:24:21,750
Scott: It's like 84 91 they meet and the Convention Center is right there.

316
00:24:21,951 --> 00:24:26,728
Scott: You can't fail to get in or out of the place on to the freeway in the direction you want to go in.

317
00:24:26,768 --> 00:24:30,623
Rym: unless you're An idiot we had more trouble parking than we did getting there.

318
00:24:31,025 --> 00:24:31,306
Scott: Yes.

319
00:24:31,406 --> 00:24:32,290
Scott: Let's start with the parking.

320
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,056
Scott: So we drive up the parking lots.

321
00:24:34,116 --> 00:24:38,210
Scott: easy to find the entrance easy to find as a lady and she says are you here for?

322
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:46,665
Scott: The anime and I'm like, yes, she says $8 all day and I'm like wonderful I gave her $8 and we go into the parking lot.

323
00:24:46,906 --> 00:24:56,766
Rym: now at this point I would like to say that pretend you're listening to an audio drama and Right after Scott said that there was a dire chord played like that was important.

324
00:24:56,866 --> 00:24:58,229
Rym: that will come into play at the end.

325
00:24:58,811 --> 00:25:09,668
Scott: Yeah, so remember we paid $8 for parking all day and we go into the parking lot and it's kind of hard to find a Spot because the the signs in the parking lot conflict each other.

326
00:25:09,869 --> 00:25:13,330
Rym: Yes It's a parking garage, but it's not a normal parking garage.

327
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:20,170
Rym: It is definitely a stadium style parking garage wherein it is designed to have people with flags putting everyone into a space.

328
00:25:20,691 --> 00:25:21,654
Rym: Mm-hmm without that.

329
00:25:21,794 --> 00:25:23,018
Rym: It is a chaotic labyrinth.

330
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:34,781
Scott: And while there were people with flags there weren't enough people with flags and It basically drove up and up until you found a place to park and then you just got the hell out of there as quick As you could.

331
00:25:34,801 --> 00:25:44,156
Rym: yeah we're not gonna talk about all the times we got lost or couldn't find the car in the parking lot because it doesn't really matter as Nothing to do with the con but just so you know The parking lot is interesting.

332
00:25:44,217 --> 00:25:50,198
Rym: if you ever go to Connecticut or the heart or the Connecticut Convention Center Do not forget where you are parked.

333
00:25:50,278 --> 00:25:53,248
Rym: There is no way to rectify that situation.

334
00:25:53,268 --> 00:26:03,373
Scott: Nope Alright, so then we followed the signs to the convention center not hard and we started walking towards what seemed to be the growing number Of cosplayers.

335
00:26:03,474 --> 00:26:09,754
Rym: now there was some other con going on in the bottom floor of the center something to do with military Contractors and Marines.

336
00:26:10,134 --> 00:26:12,038
Rym: Yep, and the other than that.

337
00:26:12,058 --> 00:26:14,866
Rym: I mean the place was absolutely Sparse and empty.

338
00:26:14,926 --> 00:26:19,061
Scott: there was almost no one around but it's also new and fancy and shiny I mean.

339
00:26:19,081 --> 00:26:34,780
Scott: the first thing I noticed was that there were like these TV displays all over the convention center and like at the doors of all the rooms and The displays were listing all the events times and rooms for the whole con which is very snazzy.

340
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:47,615
Scott: yeah, usually, you know you go to a convention or you go somewhere and they have facilities like electronic LED signs or TV monitors and the convention that you're going to doesn't take advantage of these facilities.

341
00:26:47,656 --> 00:26:51,126
Scott: and you wonder does any Convention actually take advantage of these things?

342
00:26:51,707 --> 00:27:00,105
Scott: and the fact that Connecticut actually did use the things the convention center had to offer was like Oh, all right Yeah Even though it was really empty.

343
00:27:00,406 --> 00:27:05,860
Scott: and eventually we see some people standing around and to be honest those those TVs showing all the events.

344
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,763
Scott: Weren't that useful?

345
00:27:07,164 --> 00:27:11,760
Rym: No, they weren't but you know, but we see this big stairway and we hear the convention upstairs.

346
00:27:11,861 --> 00:27:12,795
Rym: So, all right, there's the con.

347
00:27:12,835 --> 00:27:13,139
Rym: Let's go.

348
00:27:13,522 --> 00:27:20,440
Rym: We start walking up and these people who I don't know if they were staff or not But they were not identifiable as staff started yelling at us and saying no you got to go that way.

349
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,834
Scott: Well, they said where's your badge and I'm like, I want to get one.

350
00:27:23,995 --> 00:27:25,240
Scott: They said go out there.

351
00:27:25,541 --> 00:27:26,165
Scott: Yeah, go out there.

352
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:27,773
Rym: They just they didn't look like staff.

353
00:27:27,793 --> 00:27:29,060
Rym: They looked like just some some guy.

354
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,304
Scott: I think it was a security guy.

355
00:27:30,665 --> 00:27:33,494
Scott: Anyway, we went outside and there was a little tiny line.

356
00:27:33,534 --> 00:27:35,340
Scott: Maybe I don't know 20 people.

357
00:27:35,681 --> 00:27:42,734
Scott: Yeah, really small and we're on these stairs outside waiting in line And we're standing and waiting and we met some people from RIT.

358
00:27:42,935 --> 00:27:44,040
Scott: What's up, RIT people?

359
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:48,740
Rym: Yep, that was not entirely surprising because RIT is one of the geekiest places in the world.

360
00:27:49,121 --> 00:27:56,742
Scott: Yep, so we met our RIT friends and they waited in line with us and eventually they said alright now you can go inside Yep.

361
00:27:56,762 --> 00:27:59,051
Rym: Now they gave us a little after filling out the form, of course.

362
00:27:59,192 --> 00:27:59,352
Rym: Yep.

363
00:27:59,493 --> 00:28:05,111
Rym: It wasn't stupid like the Philly wizard world forum that asked us really intrusive questions.

364
00:28:05,592 --> 00:28:08,320
Scott: Yeah about the how much money do you plan to spend here?

365
00:28:08,722 --> 00:28:09,872
Rym: Well, zero now bitches.

366
00:28:10,054 --> 00:28:10,700
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

367
00:28:11,202 --> 00:28:18,420
Rym: But the one thing was that it had a decent idea where they asked for emergency contact information Which I could see for, you know kids going to a con and whatnot.

368
00:28:18,883 --> 00:28:22,679
Rym: but they gave me a little grief when I didn't fill it out and They were like, why didn't you fill this out?

369
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,754
Rym: And I had to say because there's no one who lives anywhere near here.

370
00:28:25,774 --> 00:28:26,899
Rym: who would care if I died?

371
00:28:27,682 --> 00:28:28,833
Scott: It's like who are they gonna call me?

372
00:28:29,076 --> 00:28:29,460
Scott: who's here?

373
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:34,015
Rym: Yeah, and if I got blown up odds are Scott gets blown up to Emily who's in Japan.

374
00:28:34,115 --> 00:28:35,560
Scott: Yeah, there's no one else here.

375
00:28:35,801 --> 00:28:36,727
Scott: Who's he gonna call?

376
00:28:36,747 --> 00:28:45,445
Scott: Well, I guess our other friends who were also at the con Yeah, but I mean like the next person you could calls maybe our friend in Albany who doesn't have a car Yeah, so what's he gonna do?

377
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,617
Scott: But whatever my parents you could tell my parents.

378
00:28:48,657 --> 00:28:49,299
Scott: That'd be okay.

379
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:52,717
Rym: I guess we run into the first problem of ConnectiCon.

380
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:56,832
Rym: now ConnectiCon is very expensive compared to other cons.

381
00:28:56,872 --> 00:28:58,840
Rym: It costs the same as Otakon.

382
00:28:59,701 --> 00:29:06,640
Scott: Yeah, it was a lot of money 50 bucks for the weekend at the door and Otakon is 50 bucks if you pre-register.

383
00:29:06,781 --> 00:29:08,472
Scott: And this thing is way smaller.

384
00:29:08,673 --> 00:29:14,240
Scott: and let you know It's not an insult to say some con is not as awesome and big as Otakon.

385
00:29:14,542 --> 00:29:16,032
Rym: Yeah, because no con can be.

386
00:29:16,072 --> 00:29:24,683
Scott: that's like saying, you know Going up to some Little League team and saying you're not as good as the team that won the World Series last year You saw.

387
00:29:24,783 --> 00:29:30,600
Scott: yeah, it's not really an insult if I say you don't play basketball as well as Michael Jordan.

388
00:29:31,224 --> 00:29:33,219
Scott: Yep, you can't beat up Mike Tyson.

389
00:29:34,381 --> 00:29:35,484
Rym: It's $50 at the door.

390
00:29:35,504 --> 00:29:51,200
Scott: Mm-hmm, or or it's $35 for a Saturday only now Anyone who knows anything that's a DS game and a DS game and some and like five bucks and change.

391
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:58,823
Rym: But anyone with half a brain knows that the vast majority of ATMs in the world dole out $20 bills Mm-hmm.

392
00:29:59,085 --> 00:30:05,962
Rym: Now the price for a Saturday admission was therefore on Saturday.

393
00:30:06,103 --> 00:30:21,520
Rym: at a convention like this when the majority of people buying basses are going to be buying day passes or Saturday and Sunday passes which also is a multiple of $5 and not $20 You'd better have a whole bunch of $5 bills ready for change.

394
00:30:21,872 --> 00:30:27,133
Scott: Yes Anyone who has run enough conventions has the foresight to realize something like that.

395
00:30:27,513 --> 00:30:36,668
Scott: if I was running that convention or running the registration I would have had someone go to the bank and get I don't know $10,000 in $5 bills or you know a lot of $5 bills.

396
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:46,162
Rym: or if that wasn't feasible I would have either raised the price to $40 or lowered it to $30.

397
00:30:46,162 --> 00:30:50,520
Scott: I think lowering it to $30 actually would have been the best solution because it is overpriced.

398
00:30:50,701 --> 00:30:55,439
Scott: But then they need tens then they do need tens but tens or you know, you would need less of them.

399
00:30:56,102 --> 00:30:57,869
Rym: Well, no, you would need the same number of them.

400
00:30:58,571 --> 00:31:02,755
Scott: Maybe a captain math, but it would cost More money, whatever.

401
00:31:05,481 --> 00:31:08,158
Rym: Anyway, but not only they didn't plan for this.

402
00:31:08,419 --> 00:31:10,767
Rym: now we got there really really really early.

403
00:31:10,808 --> 00:31:14,540
Rym: like not many people could have gone through that line before we got to the front of.

404
00:31:15,303 --> 00:31:18,860
Rym: And yet they were out of fives as in completely out of fives.

405
00:31:19,041 --> 00:31:21,631
Scott: There was not a single $5 bill to be had.

406
00:31:21,711 --> 00:31:28,859
Rym: they could not register us because they did not have change and we only had 20s and they refused to accept credit cards.

407
00:31:28,879 --> 00:31:31,759
Rym: and I said something like why didn't you?

408
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,049
Rym: It's $35 Didn't you guys think that everyone's gonna have 20s?

409
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:41,733
Rym: and the staffers were real kind of indignant like well Yeah, we had we didn't have enough.

410
00:31:41,995 --> 00:31:42,579
Rym: leave us alone.

411
00:31:43,141 --> 00:31:49,340
Scott: Yeah, it's like whenever you you know point out that someone didn't have foresight, you know, it's like, you know.

412
00:31:49,421 --> 00:31:55,578
Scott: They think that you know because obviously if you're in that position if someone comes up to you and it's like didn't you see this problem?

413
00:31:55,658 --> 00:31:58,950
Scott: and it's like Yeah, you have you know the 2020 hindsight.

414
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,254
Scott: we didn't have foresight.

415
00:32:00,274 --> 00:32:01,238
Scott: That's not really fair.

416
00:32:01,318 --> 00:32:01,900
Scott: get away from me.

417
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,619
Scott: But yeah, but we would have had foresight.

418
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:09,300
Rym: I could have told you that because I mean that's one of the first thing I think of whenever you know a convention or anything.

419
00:32:09,481 --> 00:32:11,552
Rym: If I were planning it is quite literally.

420
00:32:11,572 --> 00:32:16,039
Rym: All right, we're going to charge X If people are paying in 20s, how do we deal with that?

421
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,858
Scott: Yeah, well at least you know when I was taking.

422
00:32:18,999 --> 00:32:20,849
Scott: you know You do each part of the convention.

423
00:32:20,909 --> 00:32:27,960
Rym: when I was going thinking about registration That would come up almost or even when I was thinking pricing because pricing determines how much money you need.

424
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:37,484
Rym: Yep but the only way we got registered at that point was that we combined ours and we paid and I believe Scott still owes me like 10 bucks because of that.

425
00:32:37,926 --> 00:32:40,317
Scott: maybe I think they gave me like five ones.

426
00:32:40,337 --> 00:32:40,960
Scott: I don't remember.

427
00:32:41,382 --> 00:32:45,860
Rym: Yeah, it was a giant pain because we had to pay together so they wouldn't need fives for change.

428
00:32:46,241 --> 00:32:51,682
Rym: But then the people behind us couldn't pay and I hear the reg line took a long long time And not.

429
00:32:51,843 --> 00:33:12,680
Scott: and the other part of the reg line was that we went over and there were two lots, you know we went from the outside line which was short to the inside line, which was two short lines and We didn't realize right away because the signs were hidden by people but one One line said pre reg and one line said reg and we didn't find out until a bunch after a bunch of shifting happened.

430
00:33:13,081 --> 00:33:17,580
Rym: Yeah, because the signs were on the bottom of the table where people would always be standing in front of them.

431
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:25,793
Rym: So I only noticed it because someone moved and I saw the word pre for a second Yep, and then I finally, you know realized they sold.

432
00:33:25,813 --> 00:33:26,355
Scott: they told us.

433
00:33:26,616 --> 00:33:27,780
Scott: Yeah, you can use either line.

434
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,427
Scott: I'm like then why do you have that sign there?

435
00:33:29,447 --> 00:33:32,380
Scott: Yeah, why why take it down?

436
00:33:33,221 --> 00:33:34,003
Rym: Yeah, it just the.

437
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:36,873
Rym: now the registration was just a big blob and there was still.

438
00:33:36,893 --> 00:33:40,487
Rym: everyone was grumbling because the line was taking forever Because they didn't have change for five.

439
00:33:40,648 --> 00:33:46,460
Scott: It was a very small registration line That was still moving much much too slow.

440
00:33:47,042 --> 00:33:50,234
Scott: You know that they need to streamline that shit now.

441
00:33:50,535 --> 00:33:51,780
Rym: then I moved to get my badge.

442
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,207
Rym: The badge was typical and nice.

443
00:33:53,248 --> 00:33:54,434
Rym: It was you know, a good combat.

444
00:33:54,454 --> 00:33:58,191
Scott: Yeah, they took a piece of paper They laminated in one of those hot laminating machines.

445
00:33:58,231 --> 00:33:59,436
Scott: They poked some holes in it.

446
00:33:59,697 --> 00:34:06,028
Rym: There you go Yep, but then we got our goodie bags and um Best Buy was one of the sponsors.

447
00:34:06,088 --> 00:34:06,269
Rym: Okay.

448
00:34:06,289 --> 00:34:08,417
Scott: Yeah, this con had a bunch of official sponsors.

449
00:34:08,456 --> 00:34:08,938
Scott: Who were they?

450
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,260
Rym: Best Buy and Funimation.

451
00:34:14,482 --> 00:34:18,900
Scott: They're all Icons on the badge of all the official sponsors.

452
00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:23,560
Rym: Yeah, but the bag, you know, every con has Sarge's comics, which is a comic book store.

453
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,331
Rym: I go to Otakon to give you the bag full of goodies.

454
00:34:25,371 --> 00:34:26,780
Rym: go to Kotsukon to give you a bag for the goodies.

455
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,739
Rym: This bag was not a bag full of goodies.

456
00:34:30,202 --> 00:34:35,219
Rym: It was a yellow plastic Best Buy bag as in the bag they give you when you buy batteries at a Best Buy.

457
00:34:35,581 --> 00:34:40,860
Scott: Yeah, or the alternative was the clear Best Buy bag, which I guess would have been useful in the dealer's room.

458
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,072
Rym: Yep, but in the bag there was nothing but the con book.

459
00:34:45,433 --> 00:34:46,315
Scott: There was the con book.

460
00:34:46,536 --> 00:34:50,389
Scott: There's a piece of paper with changes to the con schedule and such.

461
00:34:50,891 --> 00:34:58,137
Scott: there was a piece of paper that was an advertisement and I think there was one more piece of paper for something else that no one cared about.

462
00:34:58,258 --> 00:34:58,619
Rym: that was it.

463
00:34:59,042 --> 00:35:01,600
Rym: There was nothing in the in the bag, which I don't really care.

464
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,040
Scott: But yeah, it's like usually the bag is full of advertisements and I go yeah, whatever.

465
00:35:05,202 --> 00:35:11,939
Scott: But the point is is like hey You had all these official sponsors and they didn't fill the bag up with stuff and there's no.

466
00:35:12,562 --> 00:35:19,393
Scott: The thing that I really wanted was a mini con book the one that just you know You just have a little pocket schedule, but they didn't have that I had to look.

467
00:35:19,554 --> 00:35:26,880
Scott: use the giant con You know official program to get the schedule which we'll talk about in a moment which we will yes.

468
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:29,945
Rym: but the other thing was that The bags were.

469
00:35:30,066 --> 00:35:32,133
Rym: they felt so cheap and ever.

470
00:35:32,194 --> 00:35:38,159
Rym: almost everyone just took the bag Took the con book out threw the bag away because it was a cheap nasty bag.

471
00:35:39,281 --> 00:35:41,551
Rym: Unless Best Buy forced them to they really shouldn't have bothered.

472
00:35:41,893 --> 00:35:43,219
Rym: Yeah, that just wasn't worth it.

473
00:35:43,822 --> 00:35:51,080
Scott: I mean, it's like you got someone to sponsor the bag But you didn't get anyone to put anything in the bag to make it worth carrying a bag.

474
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,048
Rym: Also, the bag is a flimsy plastic Best Buy bag.

475
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:54,850
Scott: Yeah.

476
00:35:55,231 --> 00:35:55,653
Scott: Yeah.

477
00:35:55,673 --> 00:35:58,320
Rym: All right, but whatever that doesn't detract from the con.

478
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,825
Rym: Now then we open up the book.

479
00:36:00,865 --> 00:36:12,140
Rym: now the book the convention book had been talked up to us at anime next by ConnectiCon staffers Because the whole book is full color and apparently it didn't cost him very much to make the whole book.

480
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,680
Scott: Yeah, the guy was like, oh for only a few hundred dollars more.

481
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,090
Scott: We got a full color con book.

482
00:36:16,111 --> 00:36:16,574
Scott: So we did it.

483
00:36:16,856 --> 00:36:17,380
Scott: We're awesome.

484
00:36:17,781 --> 00:36:27,335
Rym: Now the one thing I wonder and this is pure speculation because I don't know about Kinetic ons fiscal practices, but I wonder if the it's only a few hundred dollars.

485
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:28,017
Rym: Let's do it.

486
00:36:28,238 --> 00:36:33,900
Rym: policy Applied to multiple things and maybe that's the reason why this convention is so expensive.

487
00:36:34,642 --> 00:36:44,184
Rym: Maybe maybe but the book itself is full color and it's printed very well, but it was put together pretty Poorly yes.

488
00:36:44,465 --> 00:36:49,240
Rym: No, I don't mean any offense to whoever designed it but go to any other con and look at their con book.

489
00:36:50,022 --> 00:36:50,704
Scott: There's a reason.

490
00:36:50,785 --> 00:36:55,479
Scott: first of all, the other con books print their books in black and white because a they are bigger.

491
00:36:56,162 --> 00:36:58,554
Scott: B they have more information and more content.

492
00:36:58,594 --> 00:36:59,840
Scott: and see they have a lot more ads.

493
00:37:01,701 --> 00:37:07,107
Scott: Basically the page count of this is low and That low it's okay.

494
00:37:07,127 --> 00:37:07,409
Scott: It's not.

495
00:37:07,449 --> 00:37:08,252
Scott: it's not that low.

496
00:37:08,313 --> 00:37:09,799
Rym: all the information is in here.

497
00:37:10,221 --> 00:37:14,202
Rym: The problem is that one the well wonder mistakes in it Like we're.

498
00:37:14,222 --> 00:37:17,820
Rym: the one very specifically is our friend Yuko who is you know?

499
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:22,780
Rym: She was a pan well a panelist and an artist and everything there and she's a webcomic artist.

500
00:37:23,262 --> 00:37:26,296
Rym: They had her name wrong in the book, but you know minor thing.

501
00:37:26,316 --> 00:37:27,120
Rym: things like that happen.

502
00:37:27,562 --> 00:37:31,060
Scott: Another thing is that there there's schedules for everything in this visit.

503
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:37,659
Scott: You know the set and they separated the schedules and the schedules are printed in a way I like they're easy to read and figure out what's going on.

504
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,514
Scott: The thing is is that they printed all the schedule.

505
00:37:41,675 --> 00:37:43,000
Scott: that schedules take up a lot of room.

506
00:37:43,502 --> 00:37:46,940
Scott: So there's like two or three pages of panels and workshops schedule.

507
00:37:47,342 --> 00:37:51,980
Scott: Then there's two or three pages of board gaming schedule four pages of board gaming schedules.

508
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:56,220
Scott: So it's like you have to find out what you want to do and then look at the schedule.

509
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:04,670
Scott: It's really hard to you know, I like to see at one o'clock I could be doing this or this or this or this or this as Opposed to saying what do I don't want to do?

510
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,219
Scott: and then what time is it now?

511
00:38:07,645 --> 00:38:16,784
Rym: It was really kind of confusing and not just to us because Several of the people who were with us at the Connor we talked to expressed various amounts of frustration with yeah It was set up the

512
00:38:16,824 --> 00:38:24,160
Scott: way a con schedule has to be in specifically a pocket schedule because you know No one's get camp can keep whipping out this giant book at a con.

513
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,768
Scott: They need a little tiny pocket thing.

514
00:38:25,948 --> 00:38:28,360
Scott: You had to be able to whip it out and say it's one o'clock.

515
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,965
Scott: What's happening at the con right now?

516
00:38:30,026 --> 00:38:30,628
Scott: And there it is.

517
00:38:30,648 --> 00:38:32,735
Scott: Yeah, that is the perfect con schedule.

518
00:38:33,116 --> 00:38:35,779
Scott: This does not function Is that at all?

519
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:41,120
Scott: Second of all, it's like you can see in the schedule the names of the events.

520
00:38:41,722 --> 00:38:51,876
Scott: But then to actually find a description of the event you have to go sifting through this giant book, which is not the greatest Though at least the the actual descriptions are pretty good.

521
00:38:52,157 --> 00:38:52,740
Rym: I didn't read them.

522
00:38:52,780 --> 00:39:03,446
Scott: Yeah, and they have a you know a big section like even describing every board game in the gaming room and having all the guests have a big paragraph and a Picture every single anime.

523
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:07,620
Rym: they show that a picture and a big paragraph and they obviously put a lot of effort into the book.

524
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,593
Scott: But yeah, it was just tricky to find any one of those things.

525
00:39:10,653 --> 00:39:12,039
Scott: But once you found it, well there it was.

526
00:39:12,582 --> 00:39:16,600
Rym: So I guess my suggestions for this are one does it really need to be color?

527
00:39:17,181 --> 00:39:18,505
Rym: And is it worth the money?

528
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:20,593
Scott: and to even if it's one dollar?

529
00:39:20,673 --> 00:39:23,583
Scott: if the if the color doesn't do anything for you Why do it?

530
00:39:23,623 --> 00:39:24,265
Scott: just because?

531
00:39:24,868 --> 00:39:26,112
Rym: well, it's a I mean a dollar.

532
00:39:26,132 --> 00:39:26,815
Rym: it did really.

533
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:29,559
Rym: it's a cost-benefit analysis And yeah, they need to look at that.

534
00:39:29,841 --> 00:39:35,700
Rym: But more importantly have a separate pocket schedule, even if it's just a piece of paper with small text on it.

535
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,851
Scott: Yeah, just I recommend a piece of cardboard that folds in half.

536
00:39:39,012 --> 00:39:39,714
Scott: That's the best.

537
00:39:40,397 --> 00:39:52,160
Rym: Yeah, cuz and Look at other conventions like Otakon or Katsucon does a really good job with their schedules and look at what they do And then put that in your con book instead of the format you use because it was just really not the best.

538
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,743
Scott: Yeah, yep.

539
00:39:53,803 --> 00:39:54,004
Scott: Yep.

540
00:39:54,044 --> 00:39:54,204
Scott: Yep.

541
00:39:54,585 --> 00:39:59,400
Rym: But anyway, we flip through that and we saw hey, there's an anime club panel.

542
00:39:59,781 --> 00:40:03,436
Rym: I had right when we arrived basically a how to run an anime club, right?

543
00:40:03,456 --> 00:40:04,300
Scott: You went to the bathroom.

544
00:40:04,857 --> 00:40:11,332
Rym: Yeah I went to the bathroom first and also the map in the book was actually really good Except that it was wrong about where the food was.

545
00:40:11,936 --> 00:40:12,620
Scott: That's correct.

546
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:20,290
Scott: It was wrong about where the food was but everything else about the book what the map was, correct and good Yes, but we saw this panel.

547
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:30,326
Rym: that was right when we were ready to go on how to run an anime club how to start an anime club, which I thought would be interesting because I Run along with my friend Scott Johnson.

548
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:31,610
Scott: that not me.

549
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:32,974
Rym: Yeah, the other Scott.

550
00:40:33,376 --> 00:40:34,760
Scott: Yeah, I think I'm not on this show.

551
00:40:34,901 --> 00:40:36,680
Rym: I think anime world order got a little confused.

552
00:40:36,841 --> 00:40:44,497
Rym: I think they thought that me and Scott of GeekNights were a new type when in fact It was me and Scott of not GeekNights who are in new type.

553
00:40:44,678 --> 00:40:47,007
Scott: That's correct But anyway, I'll be a new type soon enough.

554
00:40:47,328 --> 00:40:54,976
Rym: those of us me and the other Scott run that exact pad And they'll say positive things about me because they only say positive at every large economy.

555
00:40:54,996 --> 00:40:59,735
Rym: We run it at Otakon We ran it at Ohio con anime central Katsucon.

556
00:41:00,037 --> 00:41:00,880
Rym: We run it everywhere.

557
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,830
Rym: It's like it's our thing and I was curious know.

558
00:41:03,891 --> 00:41:05,336
Rym: All right, these people are doing their own.

559
00:41:05,376 --> 00:41:06,279
Rym: Let's see how it goes.

560
00:41:06,299 --> 00:41:08,129
Rym: and it started late.

561
00:41:08,574 --> 00:41:13,216
Rym: and Then the girl doing it starts explaining that she was kind of thrown into it at the last minute.

562
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:17,120
Rym: She was a staffer and They just kind of needed to fill in the schedules.

563
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:20,803
Rym: So they made up this panel and threw her on it and she didn't really know a lot Mm-hmm.

564
00:41:20,843 --> 00:41:21,124
Rym: Well, she

565
00:41:21,144 --> 00:41:25,078
Scott: knew something cuz she did run an anime club, but I forget where she said she was from

566
00:41:25,259 --> 00:41:26,788
Rym: true But after I think

567
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:28,580
Scott: I'll look up her panel actually in the night

568
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:38,420
Rym: but while you do that after the second questioner show, so I answered one of the questions that someone had because She was doing a pretty good job and I give her credit especially for being thrown into this in the last minute.

569
00:41:38,962 --> 00:41:43,340
Rym: But she gave dangerously illegal advice as to how to run an anime club.

570
00:41:43,781 --> 00:41:53,680
Rym: There was a specific point in which she suggested that you show some anime and charge some money to see it And at that point I couldn't just sit there and wash and I had to stand up and say that that's super illegal.

571
00:41:54,041 --> 00:41:55,407
Rym: You can get into super trouble.

572
00:41:55,768 --> 00:41:56,551
Rym: You can't do it.

573
00:41:57,093 --> 00:42:06,300
Rym: And then I explained who I was and then Basically, the rest of the panel was people asking me questions as opposed to asking her and it was a pretty good panel.

574
00:42:06,964 --> 00:42:14,157
Rym: I wouldn't mind coming back to run the panel at Connecticut if they need someone to do it, but the panelist was Brittany Davis.

575
00:42:14,659 --> 00:42:24,235
Rym: Yep I mean really I had it to her for pulling off that panel on no notice with very little preparation or information Yeah, but we ended up answering a lot of the questions there.

576
00:42:24,717 --> 00:42:43,273
Rym: Yeah, I don't know what else I can say, but it was interesting because Ohio con and Otakon four years ago were the two other cons where I went to an anime club panel and The person who was supposed to run it wasn't there or No one was really ready to run it and this was the first time.

577
00:42:43,374 --> 00:42:45,542
Rym: I didn't just stand up and try to take it over Immediately.

578
00:42:45,562 --> 00:42:54,171
Scott: Yeah, you know, I think it is is that imagine if you were going to give a panel on Physics and then Stephen Hawking shows up in the audience.

579
00:42:54,191 --> 00:42:54,934
Scott: It's like what do you do?

580
00:42:55,074 --> 00:42:55,556
Rym: I would say.

581
00:42:55,777 --> 00:42:57,225
Rym: All right, Stephen This is your panel.

582
00:42:57,265 --> 00:42:58,150
Rym: I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

583
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:00,041
Scott: Yeah, it's you know, that's what it was Like.

584
00:43:00,081 --> 00:43:03,400
Scott: it's like she was trying to give a panel and then up me and Rym showed up in the audience.

585
00:43:04,462 --> 00:43:12,632
Rym: Yeah, but actually a lot of people in the panel seemed really interested what we had to say and At the end they all requested our little business cards.

586
00:43:12,692 --> 00:43:14,660
Rym: So I'm curious if we'll get a lot of questions.

587
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,549
Scott: Maybe some of them are listening to GeekNights right now.

588
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:27,820
Rym: Yeah also at the at the panel There was one guy who asked a question that in all my years of running club summits No one has ever asked anything even close to it and at some point I would love to interview this.

589
00:43:27,961 --> 00:43:30,138
Scott: I give him the award for best question ever.

590
00:43:31,023 --> 00:43:44,849
Rym: To sum it up real brief at a club at an anime club panel This guy is a trucker as in drives trucks for a living But he has a degree a master's degree in aerospace engineering from MIT And he's a big anime fan.

591
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:49,179
Rym: and he knows a bunch of other truckers who are big anime fans At least, you know adult swim fans.

592
00:43:49,451 --> 00:44:00,314
Rym: Yeah He wanted to form an anime club for truckers and some way where truckers on the road could meet up at rest stops and such while they're trucking and Anime and talk about anime.

593
00:44:00,899 --> 00:44:09,120
Rym: and That was the first time I didn't have any great advice for someone and I've been thinking on it long and hard Because I really want to help these guys out these guys.

594
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:17,680
Scott: Yeah, the only advice I could really give him is a use the internet a lot Yep, be maybe put signs up in truck stops if that's possible.

595
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:22,883
Scott: Yeah, he when I said that he's like if you ever been in a truck stop and I'm like, no, not really I've been in some.

596
00:44:22,903 --> 00:44:27,820
Scott: I've been I've been kind of in some you know, like those little travel centers that on the highway?

597
00:44:27,981 --> 00:44:29,070
Rym: Those are no no, no, no.

598
00:44:29,131 --> 00:44:32,188
Rym: a truck stop has Lounges and showers.

599
00:44:32,288 --> 00:44:33,636
Rym: I've showered in truck stops.

600
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:39,406
Scott: Oh Yeah, okay, and then What was the last suggestion?

601
00:44:39,446 --> 00:44:39,948
Scott: a hand form?

602
00:44:39,988 --> 00:44:44,148
Scott: All right, get a projector and put the you know The anime on the side of your truck.

603
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:46,400
Scott: Yep, sit outside on little lawn chairs.

604
00:44:46,663 --> 00:44:51,371
Rym: Well, I just thought that was really interesting And now I am prepared to answer that question.

605
00:44:51,431 --> 00:45:00,775
Scott: if anyone ever asks it again watch next time Someone's gonna come out and be like, yeah, I'm in the Antarctic expedition, how do I start an anime club?

606
00:45:00,936 --> 00:45:01,760
Rym: Oh, I can handle that.

607
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:07,344
Rym: Yeah, I just couldn't handle the truckers because get the penguins to watch with you All right.

608
00:45:07,767 --> 00:45:09,780
Rym: Yeah, so after that we wandered around a bit.

609
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:13,076
Rym: We met our friend cat who showed up a little later and we hung out with her.

610
00:45:13,136 --> 00:45:16,152
Rym: She's an awesome person Mm-hmm, and then we went in the dealers room.

611
00:45:16,635 --> 00:45:17,499
Scott: Mmm the dealers room.

612
00:45:17,942 --> 00:45:20,840
Rym: It was a typical anime club deal or anime con dealers room.

613
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:24,755
Scott: There were a lot of dealers who were at anime next and I knew cuz I was like.

614
00:45:24,815 --> 00:45:26,080
Scott: I saw you at anime next.

615
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:26,943
Scott: What are you doing here?

616
00:45:27,004 --> 00:45:31,060
Rym: Yep, our friends Luke and Gabby who run a big anime store in Rochester, New York.

617
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:31,903
Rym: We're actually there.

618
00:45:32,083 --> 00:45:33,829
Rym: Yep, which was a total surprise.

619
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:36,840
Rym: like we're walking and suddenly I hear oh my god.

620
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,570
Rym: And I look and I go oh my god.

621
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,320
Scott: Yeah, they are who we didn't know.

622
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,951
Rym: The other guy was coming and it was several minutes of hey.

623
00:45:43,052 --> 00:45:43,775
Rym: Hey, what's up?

624
00:45:43,876 --> 00:45:44,338
Rym: I don't know.

625
00:45:44,358 --> 00:45:45,623
Rym: Oh my god We're at a con.

626
00:45:45,884 --> 00:45:46,507
Rym: Yeah.

627
00:45:46,808 --> 00:45:49,117
Scott: Yeah, we both went to the same con without knowing.

628
00:45:49,137 --> 00:45:49,438
Scott: Holy crap.

629
00:45:50,589 --> 00:45:54,254
Rym: also all the Big name web comics that were at the con.

630
00:45:54,275 --> 00:45:55,300
Rym: This is a webcomic convention.

631
00:45:55,381 --> 00:45:58,000
Rym: We're set up in the dealers room instead of in the artist colony.

632
00:45:58,085 --> 00:46:07,913
Scott: Yeah the artist colony was a hallway of tables as opposed to a room of tables which kind of worked and All the big web comics guys weren't in the artist colony.

633
00:46:07,933 --> 00:46:09,680
Scott: They were in the dealers room at tables.

634
00:46:09,961 --> 00:46:14,960
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I wasn't sure if the con gave in those tables if they bought them or whatever, but that's how it was.

635
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:21,889
Rym: Yep, not to sound elitist, but it was definitely all of the well-known major Acclaimed web comics were in the dealers room.

636
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:22,151
Scott: Yep.

637
00:46:22,171 --> 00:46:23,699
Scott: The first guy I think we saw was dr.

638
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:24,482
Scott: McNinja guy.

639
00:46:24,703 --> 00:46:27,010
Rym: Yeah, which we didn't have much to say to him other than your comics.

640
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:27,552
Rym: Great.

641
00:46:27,792 --> 00:46:29,357
Rym: Yeah, I really like dr.

642
00:46:29,377 --> 00:46:30,220
Rym: McNinja a lot.

643
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:30,822
Scott: I like dr.

644
00:46:30,862 --> 00:46:34,656
Scott: McNinja a lot too, but you know, he was a normal cool guy and we're normal.

645
00:46:34,716 --> 00:46:35,017
Scott: Dr.

646
00:46:35,078 --> 00:46:36,826
Scott: McNinja readers What do we have to say to him?

647
00:46:37,329 --> 00:46:38,798
Rym: Yep, so we went around all the webcomics.

648
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:41,388
Rym: a lot of them We'd already met or talked to at mocha.

649
00:46:41,448 --> 00:46:42,994
Rym: So we didn't really need to say hey again.

650
00:46:43,014 --> 00:46:44,500
Scott: Yeah, it's like oh I seen you.

651
00:46:44,923 --> 00:46:52,445
Scott: Oh, I seen you and I could waste your time though We had a fun bit with Greg Dean of real-life comics, yes see Greg Dean of real-life comics I've been reading.

652
00:46:52,465 --> 00:46:57,669
Scott: I'm gonna be honest real-life comics Isn't my absolute favorite webcomic?

653
00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:00,960
Scott: not every single comic makes me laugh and roll all over the floor.

654
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:01,605
Rym: Yeah, I got to admit.

655
00:47:01,625 --> 00:47:08,758
Scott: I liked it a lot more several years ago Yep, but it's still a good comic and I've been reading it for a long time because it's never been.

656
00:47:08,778 --> 00:47:10,003
Scott: you know Some comics.

657
00:47:10,063 --> 00:47:12,833
Scott: they just you know, they get bad and then you stop reading them.

658
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:15,083
Scott: real life has been good enough You know.

659
00:47:15,103 --> 00:47:17,257
Scott: on average throughout the years I just keep reading it.

660
00:47:17,539 --> 00:47:20,600
Rym: Yep It's got a lot of momentum a lot of history and it's a good comic.

661
00:47:20,721 --> 00:47:23,700
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty good and it always you know, it kind of follows the guy's life, too.

662
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:31,651
Scott: So as his life changes so does the comic and since we're slightly younger than him I think then, you know, it kind of fits our lives as well.

663
00:47:31,752 --> 00:47:33,780
Rym: Anyway, Scott had this shirt.

664
00:47:34,402 --> 00:47:38,460
Scott: I had this shirt when I was a freshman in college, which is about when I started reading real life.

665
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:42,382
Scott: So that was in 2000. good God, maybe 2001 Maybe.

666
00:47:42,904 --> 00:47:45,212
Scott: I bought a shirt from real-life comics.

667
00:47:45,233 --> 00:47:45,353
Scott: now.

668
00:47:45,413 --> 00:47:47,240
Scott: at the time real life was much smaller.

669
00:47:47,381 --> 00:47:59,607
Scott: it was like still a keen spot or he possibly not even keen spot yet and The shirt was from cafe press and it has characters on it that aren't in the comic anymore doing things that the comic is no Longer about now.

670
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:00,754
Rym: It's a really good shirt though.

671
00:48:00,854 --> 00:48:05,493
Rym: Now it is Baited stained somewhat smelly and generally wrinkled.

672
00:48:05,553 --> 00:48:07,360
Scott: Yeah, it's a. it's a kind of shirt you wear to bed.

673
00:48:07,461 --> 00:48:08,800
Scott: It's not a kind of shirt you wear around.

674
00:48:08,885 --> 00:48:13,148
Scott: Of course I did wear it around at many Conventions and it gets a lot of compliments.

675
00:48:13,168 --> 00:48:16,980
Scott: like that shirt and my new Boas's shirt tend to get mad compliments.

676
00:48:17,121 --> 00:48:17,883
Rym: Yeah, hint hint.

677
00:48:17,943 --> 00:48:19,148
Rym: remake the shirt hint hint.

678
00:48:19,348 --> 00:48:22,520
Rym: Yeah, make it like a vintage tee or something something like that.

679
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,484
Scott: You know higher quality.

680
00:48:23,504 --> 00:48:25,271
Scott: I'll buy it cuz now you sign this one.

681
00:48:25,291 --> 00:48:27,219
Scott: So I'm not really gonna get my sweat all over it.

682
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:30,552
Scott: Yeah Anyway, the point is is I went up to the guy.

683
00:48:30,572 --> 00:48:35,531
Scott: the first thing I said to him which is kind of asshole Kinda was you know how long I've been reading your comic?

684
00:48:36,054 --> 00:48:36,757
Scott: and he was like what?

685
00:48:36,797 --> 00:48:37,219
Scott: two days.

686
00:48:38,521 --> 00:48:40,591
Scott: And I was like and I'm like no you gotta check this out.

687
00:48:40,993 --> 00:48:42,340
Scott: and I went and I took out the shirt.

688
00:48:42,481 --> 00:48:45,982
Scott: He was like god damn Holy shit.

689
00:48:46,705 --> 00:48:48,493
Scott: I was like when was the last time you saw one of these?

690
00:48:48,553 --> 00:48:50,300
Scott: and he's like, well, I got one in my closet.

691
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,959
Scott: I'm like, I know you got one in your closet.

692
00:48:54,481 --> 00:48:59,620
Rym: He was just I mean of all the webcomic artists we talked to at conventions other than the ones we know really really well.

693
00:49:00,141 --> 00:49:03,512
Rym: He was probably one of the most personable and just hey, what up?

694
00:49:03,773 --> 00:49:12,445
Scott: Yeah, he was very normal sociable, you know And it was kind of it was cool to meet him at you know, such a con like ConnectiCon because he's from freakin California.

695
00:49:12,465 --> 00:49:14,480
Scott: so he came all the way across the country for this.

696
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:20,020
Scott: So I figure hey, you know and then we actually had a lot to relate to him with you know talking about podcasting.

697
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:24,279
Scott: He does a lot of podcasting internet radio stuff, you know, he's into that.

698
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:33,062
Rym: So, you know we talked about that for a few minutes and then we parted ways Yep, and we didn't actually go back into the dealers room because I did want to go back and talk to some other people there But whatever.

699
00:49:33,523 --> 00:49:36,472
Scott: Yeah, we pretty much did all the dealing that was necessary at the.

700
00:49:37,114 --> 00:49:39,300
Scott: buy one manga get two free table.

701
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,006

Scott: Buy one get two free.

710
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:58,135
Scott: that would have been.

711
00:49:58,315 --> 00:49:59,260
Scott: Scott goes home poor.

712
00:49:59,642 --> 00:50:00,426
Rym: Yeah, no, that would have.

713
00:50:00,547 --> 00:50:03,322
Rym: I would have been like, you know Scott That would have been.

714
00:50:03,363 --> 00:50:05,754
Rym: Scott drives home in his car Rym drives home in the u-haul.

715
00:50:05,774 --> 00:50:06,880
Rym: We rented exactly.

716
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,400
Scott: I would have been like, you know, I already have all of Eagle, but you know what as well buy it again.

717
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,529
Rym: So I have a lender copy and a keeping copy.

00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:18,648
Scott: Hey, you know what that LuPone manga They got like in the GTO.

719
00:50:18,688 --> 00:50:20,860
Scott: They've got like 30 volumes of that stuff.

720
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:27,696
Scott: How much money will I save if I buy it all it only cost me to see 10 times a hundred bucks for 30 volumes Huh?

721
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:39,840
Scott: Anyway, now it was only on CPM manga because CPM is laid laid off all their staff If you recall a news from a few weeks ago, so yeah, they're kind of going out of business.

722
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,120
Scott: So their manga was on the super discount as well as some other manga.

723
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:50,691
Rym: No, it was a lot of bad manga a lot of great manga a lot of manga that's bad But I like anyway like geo breeders, which is just terrible, but I love it.

724
00:50:50,872 --> 00:50:53,420
Scott: Yeah, I forgot exactly which manga I bought.

725
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:59,160
Scott: Oh, I bought some manhwa which is hard-boiled angel because I got volume one of that for cheap.

726
00:50:59,361 --> 00:51:01,188
Scott: I figured why not get two and three?

727
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:06,259
Scott: I got next world, which is a Which was an overpriced?

728
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,173
Scott: Tezuka manga from Dark Horse, but at buy one get two free.

729
00:51:10,193 --> 00:51:15,791
Scott: It was no longer overpriced and I got like fist of the blue sky.

730
00:51:15,851 --> 00:51:20,142
Scott: I think it was by the same publisher who published first.

731
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:28,833
Scott: president of Japan in the US and it looks to be sort of a fist of the North Star but Also Yakuza type of thing more of the Yakuza.

732
00:51:28,853 --> 00:51:29,656
Rym: I like Yakuza.

733
00:51:29,737 --> 00:51:31,253
Scott: I like Yakuza a lot So I picked it up.

734
00:51:31,801 --> 00:51:46,738
Rym: So then we went out from there hung around with cat for a bit and then we went over to the gaming room Which if you want to hear about the gaming experiences at ConnectiCon beyond the fact that they were awesome and well done And I give mad props check out yesterday's episode.

735
00:51:46,919 --> 00:51:51,520
Scott: Yes This is the point at which I played Puerto Rico and Rym went to his uber comic panel.

736
00:51:51,793 --> 00:51:57,760
Rym: Yep Now ConnectiCon has a thing that me and cat went to this because Scott was playing Puerto Rico and yuko was still busy.

737
00:51:58,201 --> 00:52:00,608
Rym: But they their stick like the thing.

738
00:52:00,668 --> 00:52:19,669
Rym: the special thing they do is that all the webcomic artists are there like anyone who does a Webcomic can become a guest at ConnectiCon and they do a huge uber web comics panel where Every web comic artist they have there gets on stage at once and I had heard very mixed reviews of this concept But most of them have been very positive.

739
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:24,751
Rym: So I decided alright in the interest of journalism I will sit there and cover this now.

740
00:52:24,812 --> 00:52:38,515
Rym: the first thing which I talked about yesterday But I'll mention briefly is that there were an infinite number of Nintendo DS is there and there was an entire Metaconversation Simulcast of the entire panel going on in Picto chat.

741
00:52:39,037 --> 00:52:40,000
Rym: It was insane.

742
00:52:41,102 --> 00:52:55,452
Rym: Beyond that the panel I was really really underwhelmed with which I Don't want to say this but it really was kind of boring and luckily I have a lot of constructive criticism on how to fix this now.

743
00:52:55,573 --> 00:52:58,288
Rym: It was a lot of webcomic artists I think.

744
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:04,199
Rym: after I talked about it I'll say who was all up there because I think I'd like to go through the list of all the webcomics that were at the Con and talk about them a bit.

745
00:53:04,683 --> 00:53:12,466
Rym: But they had a whole bunch of people up there half of whom were Really really funny and personable and had a funny joke or a story for just about any question Anyone asked.

746
00:53:12,749 --> 00:53:14,322
Rym: half of them are real quiet Whatever.

747
00:53:14,823 --> 00:53:19,580
Rym: some of them said things that made the crowd get a little antsy or they'd no one really booed.

748
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:21,410
Rym: But they there were definitely some grumbles.

749
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:25,768
Scott: after a few things some comic artists said Oh, could you give an example of a grumbling comment?

750
00:53:26,009 --> 00:53:26,411
Rym: Oh why?

751
00:53:26,551 --> 00:53:29,180
Rym: I have a perfect example that I'll talk about later.

752
00:53:29,461 --> 00:53:37,314
Rym: Awesome when it becomes relevant because that was one of the few Embarrassing things that has ever happened to me in my life.

753
00:53:37,958 --> 00:53:38,862
Rym: I mean wow I can't.

754
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:42,335
Scott: I can't really possibly be embarrassed like even if that happened to me.

755
00:53:42,375 --> 00:53:46,190
Rym: I would have been like oh no I wasn't embarrassed, but it was an embarrassing moment.

756
00:53:46,572 --> 00:53:48,580
Rym: Uh-huh like it was a thing that could cause embarrassment.

757
00:53:48,943 --> 00:53:50,720
Scott: It was someone else would have been embarrassed.

758
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:51,302
Rym: It was also.

759
00:53:51,322 --> 00:53:57,825
Rym: it is rare where I will anger someone unintentionally like if I want someone to be angry I make them angry.

760
00:53:58,146 --> 00:54:04,736
Rym: if I'm in a political argument, and I want to pull an and culture I'll make someone angry, but I made someone angry unintentionally.

761
00:54:04,756 --> 00:54:07,535
Scott: You don't make them angry No, I that they get angry.

762
00:54:07,555 --> 00:54:08,120
Rym: fine fine fine.

763
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:12,555
Rym: I create a situation where in another person of reasonable intelligence will likely become perturbed.

764
00:54:12,635 --> 00:54:14,020
Scott: there you go anyway.

765
00:54:14,442 --> 00:54:14,985
Scott: That's the one.

766
00:54:15,367 --> 00:54:15,488
Rym: now.

767
00:54:15,528 --> 00:54:36,079
Rym: the way they ran the panel was everyone sat up there And they had a couple mics and they had a guy who was kind of an emcee But he really just kind of stayed away And they take a question from the crowd or from a pre-defined list of questions And they'd ask it to the web comics panel And then they would pass the mic around and every single person would answer it sometimes at length.

768
00:54:36,641 --> 00:54:37,507
Rym: Then they would ask another.

769
00:54:37,527 --> 00:54:39,199
Scott: some of the people just go like yep, what he said?

770
00:54:39,239 --> 00:54:49,640
Rym: yep But he said no in fact almost everyone answered everything with a funny quip like well I forget all the questions, but there was something like what motivates you or whatever and one guy's like cocaine.

771
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:56,144
Rym: I Can't really get all the humor that was at this thing out But it was.

772
00:54:56,345 --> 00:55:07,316
Rym: there were many hilarious moments and many of these people would do very well to run their own panels on unrelated topics and just be funny at a con or Say be on a podcast and tent

773
00:55:07,658 --> 00:55:08,040
Scott: yeah

774
00:55:08,501 --> 00:55:17,932
Rym: but the fact remains that despite the funniness there was a lot of man and a lot of just shuffling time as the mic got passed around and When they took questions from the audience.

775
00:55:18,274 --> 00:55:32,097
Rym: there were a lot of questions I would have wanted to ask but I couldn't because you couldn't really ask a question to an individual person or if you asked any Difficult question that would kill the panel because now every one of them is going to answer.

776
00:55:32,137 --> 00:55:36,536
Rym: it is going to take forever And it was just kind of unmoderated and chaotic and what they should have done.

777
00:55:36,556 --> 00:55:38,463
Rym: This is my Professional opinion.

778
00:55:38,905 --> 00:55:43,700
Rym: they should have had a master of ceremonies and in addition to that a couple of guys who were question takers.

779
00:55:44,122 --> 00:55:49,840
Rym: Now the master of ceremonies should have stood up front and moderated and the way I would have done it now Were other ways people could disagree.

780
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:55,580
Rym: This is just the way I would have run the panel if I were in charge of it And I were staff at Connecticut.

781
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,610
Rym: I would have had all the webcomic artists up because I'd like.

782
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:01,520
Rym: the idea of the uber panel of everyone is on this panel.

783
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:02,444
Rym: It's the giant thing.

784
00:56:02,464 --> 00:56:03,509
Rym: they made a big deal about it.

785
00:56:04,011 --> 00:56:05,880
Scott: Yeah, that's what attracts people to the panel.

786
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:09,120
Scott: That's what brings it to main events instead of just a normal panel room.

787
00:56:09,261 --> 00:56:12,479
Scott: So you can't really give that up or else the point is lost.

788
00:56:12,901 --> 00:56:17,180
Rym: Now one the MC had that we should have memorized who everyone was and either introduce them all.

789
00:56:17,461 --> 00:56:18,806
Scott: MC didn't knew who everyone was.

790
00:56:19,148 --> 00:56:20,272
Rym: the MC didn't bother with that.

791
00:56:20,312 --> 00:56:22,139
Rym: They just kind of move the mics around on their own.

792
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:23,864
Rym: I'm just saying what I would do.

793
00:56:24,306 --> 00:56:31,372
Rym: I'm really not covering exactly what they did because it was kind of met and Because actually when they started introducing themselves, they said their name.

794
00:56:31,873 --> 00:56:33,559
Rym: They didn't say what comic they did.

795
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:40,580
Rym: Yeah, which didn't work because while I know the names of all the comics I know I don't know what your comic is if I don't read your comic.

796
00:56:40,881 --> 00:56:45,780
Scott: Yeah, so everyone really should have said their name what comic they do now what comics they've done.

797
00:56:45,901 --> 00:56:48,099
Rym: They self-corrected on that after about four people.

798
00:56:48,424 --> 00:57:00,440
Rym: but I would have then had an MC and taken questions in the audience and I would have had a Laundry list of backup questions in case the audience didn't have anything to ask and always ask the most interesting question on the list.

799
00:57:00,941 --> 00:57:26,899
Rym: Now what I would have done then is I would have taken a question from the audience and then I would have given it To one two or three of the people on the panel and I would have chosen semi randomly and uniformly except for cases when either a an artist signaled that they have a really good story to answer this question or Someone had already answered it a million times and I wasn't gonna have them say the same thing or you know things like that.

800
00:57:27,282 --> 00:57:31,329
Rym: But like say someone asked Where do you get your inspiration for webcomics?

801
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:34,707
Rym: I would have said all right, Brian Clevenger What do you have to say about this?

802
00:57:34,747 --> 00:57:35,633
Rym: blah blah blah blah blah blah.

803
00:57:35,935 --> 00:57:39,633
Rym: All right, and I'm trying to think of someone who I am NOT of someone.

804
00:57:39,653 --> 00:57:42,527
Rym: I don't know Chris Malone How about you handle this question?

805
00:57:42,968 --> 00:57:44,073
Scott: or just look at the con guy.

806
00:57:44,133 --> 00:57:50,534
Rym: there's a billion webcomic artists in there Yeah, but I would have taken each question and handed it to a handful of artists.

807
00:57:50,855 --> 00:57:52,440
Rym: that way you could get more questions out.

808
00:57:52,902 --> 00:57:59,867
Rym: I also would have accepted specific questions to specific artists as long as they were interesting or If they could have had relevance to where.

809
00:58:00,229 --> 00:58:04,144
Rym: then I could pick another person to answer the question further Even if they weren't related to it.

810
00:58:04,365 --> 00:58:14,040
Scott: Mm-hmm, and I'm sure that whatever answer one artist would give that The the there would be many tangents spewing from their answer that other artists would love to jump on.

811
00:58:14,104 --> 00:58:16,833
Rym: Yeah And you let them go with that and you make sure there's a lot of humor in there.

812
00:58:17,014 --> 00:58:22,056
Scott: as long as it stays interesting It's as soon as it's not interesting and people stop laughing and stop enjoying themselves.

813
00:58:22,096 --> 00:58:23,019
Scott: Then you got to push it.

814
00:58:23,516 --> 00:58:30,919
Rym: Yeah The basic point is that I would get someone who's very skilled at being an emcee or a moderator and have them moderate it In whatever way they see fit.

815
00:58:31,282 --> 00:58:43,479
Rym: I kind of gave a brief overview of how I would have because that's what I do when I run panels like that But as they just should have had someone who was experienced at that to run it and I think it would have been a lot Smoother it was a lot more entertaining and overall would have been a lot better.

816
00:58:43,941 --> 00:58:48,000
Scott: Yeah, I mean the panel only has so many minutes to it, you know total.

817
00:58:48,161 --> 00:58:55,660
Rym: so just so much of the time was wasted passing the mic around everyone and A lot of people gave really like a lot of you'll get funny answers.

818
00:58:55,740 --> 00:59:18,740
Rym: But a lot of questions like all the funny answers were taken and people would either try to give another funny answer which would fall over flat or Give a boring serious answer that no one cared about or talk at length about a semi unrelated topic and then they and then when they would stop talking there'd be silence for a while and then someone would say Yeah, and then the panel would get back on track.

819
00:59:19,263 --> 00:59:25,059
Scott: So as soon as I finished playing the game of Puerto Rico I walked in the hallway pulled out my cell phone and attempted to call Rym.

820
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:27,028
Scott: and Who is standing right in front of me?

821
00:59:27,411 --> 00:59:28,780
Rym: me about to call Scott?

822
00:59:29,242 --> 00:59:29,683
Scott: Look at that.

823
00:59:30,326 --> 00:59:33,196
Rym: now at this point we I forget exactly what we did.

824
00:59:33,216 --> 00:59:33,698
Scott: I think we were starving.

825
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,626
Rym: Yeah, we went to get food.

826
00:59:35,928 --> 00:59:38,720
Rym: We finally ran into yuko who we'd been trying to see for the whole combo.

827
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:39,644
Scott: She was always rented.

828
00:59:39,925 --> 00:59:40,407
Scott: Oh, he did right?

829
00:59:40,427 --> 00:59:40,889
Scott: Yeah, that's right.

830
00:59:40,969 --> 00:59:41,913
Rym: Yeah, she was trying to.

831
00:59:42,154 --> 00:59:43,460
Rym: she was helping Brian with something.

832
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:44,547
Rym: So we didn't get to see her yet.

833
00:59:44,949 --> 00:59:46,740
Rym: So we ran by her artist colony table.

834
00:59:47,302 --> 00:59:48,888
Rym: We then immediately ran away to get food.

835
00:59:48,908 --> 00:59:49,409
Rym: Mm-hmm.

836
00:59:49,811 --> 00:59:51,075
Rym: That was an adventure.

837
00:59:51,115 --> 00:59:51,637
Rym: We went out.

838
00:59:51,677 --> 00:59:52,380
Rym: We couldn't find the car.

839
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:57,956
Scott: Well, no first I went and asked a guy in the parking lot, you know Can I leave and come back with this parking ticket?

840
00:59:57,997 --> 00:59:58,480
Scott: He said yes.

841
00:59:58,981 --> 01:00:00,064
Rym: So we got in the car.

842
01:00:00,085 --> 01:00:04,801
Scott: we after we found the car now It's like.

843
01:00:04,841 --> 01:00:07,048
Scott: I remembered that I parked in d2 r2 d2.

844
01:00:07,068 --> 01:00:07,128
Scott: Yep.

845
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:09,394
Scott: We didn't go to r2 or c3 or anything.

846
01:00:11,505 --> 01:00:12,944
Scott: But yeah He went to d2.

847
01:00:13,345 --> 01:00:19,619
Scott: and the thing is he couldn't find d2 because the signs in the parking lot lied Like actually they were wrong.

848
01:00:19,901 --> 01:00:25,102
Rym: There was a sign that said D this way and another sign that said D this other way and one of those signs was not Correct

849
01:00:25,464 --> 01:00:32,319
Scott: and we ended up at the complete opposite end of the parking lot from D And then we ended up at the correct D and we found the car.

850
01:00:32,661 --> 01:00:36,375
Rym: But that has nothing to do with Connecticut and I can't blame the con for that.

851
01:00:36,415 --> 01:00:37,962
Rym: That is just the convention center Yep.

852
01:00:38,345 --> 01:00:45,940
Rym: Now luckily our friend cat he died Is somewhat of a native so she was able to direct us to food which meant we had to get on the freeway.

853
01:00:46,182 --> 01:00:53,180
Scott: Yes near the convention center There is very little to eat so a lot of people ended up eating the convention center overpriced food.

854
01:00:53,722 --> 01:00:56,109
Rym: Now Otakon has finally solved this problem.

855
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:59,740
Scott: They well, we think they're going to solve this problem.

856
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:09,630
Rym: Well thing I trust what Jim Vowell said and I trust everything I've read that supposedly at Otakon this year the food at the convention is going to be good affordable and Asian Mm-hmm.

857
01:01:09,873 --> 01:01:14,320
Scott: now Why would anyone eat it when you can walk across the skywalk to the mall?

858
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:19,200
Rym: Why what if it's the same price or only a tiny bit more expensive, but you don't have to go anywhere?

859
01:01:19,441 --> 01:01:21,189
Scott: That would that might do it.

860
01:01:21,269 --> 01:01:23,700
Scott: that would have to be as good because there's good food over there.

861
01:01:24,042 --> 01:01:24,729
Rym: Yeah, so we'll see.

862
01:01:24,789 --> 01:01:33,529
Rym: but the thing is this con either didn't have enough clout with the convention center to demand something like that or They just didn't even think about it.

863
01:01:33,549 --> 01:01:35,380
Scott: You weren't allowed to bring in outside food.

864
01:01:35,541 --> 01:01:47,137
Rym: Yeah now it theoretically at Otakon and all these other cons You're also not allowed to bring outside food in but they had prominent signs all over the place You cannot bring food in and security guards preventing you from bringing in food.

865
01:01:47,237 --> 01:01:49,966
Scott: Otakon You quote can't bring in food.

866
01:01:50,006 --> 01:01:51,109
Scott: people bring in freaking.

867
01:01:51,189 --> 01:01:51,811
Rym: now keep in mind.

868
01:01:51,831 --> 01:01:53,496
Rym: This wasn't Connecticut security.

869
01:01:53,536 --> 01:01:55,100
Rym: This was convention center security.

870
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:57,259
Scott: Yeah, nothing to do with Connecticut just convention center.

871
01:01:57,722 --> 01:02:02,580
Scott: Yeah, but the thing is never anal because it's a brand new convention center and they're trying to make their money back on it.

872
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:06,029
Rym: Yeah, it was six dollars for a burger not even a cheeseburger.

873
01:02:06,070 --> 01:02:12,343
Rym: just a burger was four dollars for a hot dog a Shitty hot dog.

874
01:02:12,423 --> 01:02:18,770
Rym: and the fact is many of the people of the con didn't have cars or couldn't drive or whatever And they were really forced to eat that food.

875
01:02:18,810 --> 01:02:20,960
Rym: and I felt bad for him because I know they don't have a lot of money.

876
01:02:21,341 --> 01:02:25,780
Scott: Yeah, I mean especially after you pay so much money to get to the con, you know the registration.

877
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:26,823
Scott: So

878
01:02:27,317 --> 01:02:40,471
Rym: yeah but then we ate our food and we came back and then we hung out with you go at our artist alley table for a While and chilled and talked about web comics and fun and we looked around in the artist colony Which sad to say was really kind of lackluster.

879
01:02:40,491 --> 01:02:42,559
Rym: I expected a lot more from a web comics con.

880
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:50,580
Scott: Yeah I mean there was the same girl I always see who has the cute buttons and there was a guy making some statues and who's really good at making statues.

881
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:57,829
Scott: But to be honest his painting of the statues was while not crappy and much better than I could ever do It wasn't as good as some of the work.

882
01:02:57,869 --> 01:03:00,583
Scott: I've seen from some of the people I know Yeah, it was just.

883
01:03:00,945 --> 01:03:04,780
Rym: it really was a far cry from like katsu con or Otakon's artist colony or artists.

884
01:03:05,001 --> 01:03:12,587
Scott: It was basically just one hallway of tables with the manga library at the end of it and in the manga library wasn't anything special It's just a manga library.

885
01:03:12,607 --> 01:03:15,882
Rym: Yeah, I just expected such a bigger artist alley and I'm surprised it was so small.

886
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:23,120
Scott: and also you figure for a web comics panel that like all these aspiring web comicists would be in there but Not so many really.

887
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:39,720
Rym: Well, I think what really hurt it too was that for whatever design or reason it was all the big name like well-known I don't want to say good but just well-known popular comics were in the dealers room and It seems like all the unknown or second tier or smaller comics for the most part were in the artist colony.

888
01:03:40,262 --> 01:03:44,920
Rym: So all the people who wanted to talk to webcomic people were hanging out in the dealers room all day.

889
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:50,539
Scott: It's funny how at Otakon the tables for an artist's alley are arranged much more like a colony.

890
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:55,924
Scott: yet It's called artists alley and here where they're arranged literally almost in an alley It caught the artist colony.

891
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:57,009
Rym: katsu con was both.

892
01:03:57,350 --> 01:04:04,938
Rym: it had the hallway leading to the artist Alley was full of tables along the wall and then there was a room full of normal shape tables.

893
01:04:05,239 --> 01:04:07,853
Rym: Wow Yeah, Katsu kana is a big artist alley.

894
01:04:07,974 --> 01:04:09,060
Scott: I like big artists alleys.

895
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:10,780
Scott: That's becoming the best part of the con.

896
01:04:10,981 --> 01:04:16,219
Scott: You know that most of the cons I go to because it's the part that has the interesting new stuff and the right.

897
01:04:16,239 --> 01:04:17,222
Scott: the dealers Rooms are just.

898
01:04:17,563 --> 01:04:21,455
Scott: I've seen all these half these dealers before or I've played all these games before.

899
01:04:21,556 --> 01:04:22,860
Scott: I've heard all these panels before.

900
01:04:23,261 --> 01:04:28,492
Rym: now I'd like to go through because they have all the web comics here and I don't want to sound elitist.

901
01:04:28,512 --> 01:04:29,440
Rym: I'm not making fun of anyone.

902
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:34,580
Rym: I just want to go through and you know note the comics that I know and the comics that I'd never heard of.

903
01:04:35,202 --> 01:04:35,523
Scott: All right.

904
01:04:35,804 --> 01:04:36,086

Rym: I gotta say Shawn Wang the guy who does this comic.

989
01:07:18,774 --> 01:07:19,840
Rym: he was sitting on the end.

990
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:25,520
Rym: He was like the first guy introduced in the web comics panel and he seemed really quiet like he didn't say much.

991
01:07:25,882 --> 01:07:28,680
Rym: But then when he finally said something he was really funny and awesome.

992
01:07:29,102 --> 01:07:33,020
Rym: So I just want to say he was kind of like that white dressed Yakuza guy in that Simpsons episode.

993
01:07:33,684 --> 01:07:35,433
Scott: Oh, I love that white Yakuza guy.

994
01:07:35,534 --> 01:07:37,630
Scott: That's one of my favorite bits Staccato.

995
01:07:37,650 --> 01:07:40,439
Scott: All right I never read this and I never heard of it.

996
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:54,325
Scott: but I was informed that the funny shirts the ones with the katamari balls that say this is how I roll and The one that I have which is a picture of a Nintendo cartridge that says blow me These guys make those shirts.

997
01:07:54,466 --> 01:07:56,613
Rym: apparently, yes, you should probably check out the comic.

998
01:07:57,034 --> 01:07:58,198
Rym: Mm-hmm stuff sucks.

999
01:07:58,599 --> 01:08:00,829

1001
01:08:03,661 --> 01:08:05,527
Scott: Yeah, and wasteland never heard of it.

1002
01:08:05,888 --> 01:08:09,579
Rym: Now the one cool thing and it's both a pro and a kind of web of kinetic.

1003
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:15,000
Rym: on That they put everyone and anyone who's a webcomic artist is a guest.

1004
01:08:15,523 --> 01:08:17,899
Rym: Anyone who is a webcomic artist is on the uber comic panel.

1005
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:22,194
Scott: You could draw a stick figure webcomic and get on the webcomic panel and it's awesome.

1006
01:08:22,215 --> 01:08:30,970
Rym: because I love this idea of Inclusion and that I mean it's a chance for people who maybe have a not so well-known comic to get themselves Well-known because if they're good, they'll explode.

1007
01:08:30,991 --> 01:08:33,001
Rym: I mean, that's just the way webcomics work Mm-hmm.

1008
01:08:33,242 --> 01:08:36,433
Rym: It just surprised me that I mean I am really into webcomics.

1009
01:08:36,453 --> 01:08:46,380
Scott: I'm constantly looking for new ones to read and I'm not constantly looking but I read them ones that I read every day and I just I like it when new Amazing ones fall into my lap.

1010
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:52,700
Scott: The problem is I'm kind of reading like the cream of the crop with like penny arcade and Boasis and such.

1011
01:08:53,263 --> 01:09:01,638
Scott: So it's really hard for new ones to make it through Especially because they have to compete with stuff that I don't read anymore like bad boys a computer side.

1012
01:09:01,658 --> 01:09:10,380
Rym: Yeah I guess it's just that I'd never heard of more than half of these comics Despite the fact that I'm a massive massive fan of webcomics.

1013
01:09:10,982 --> 01:09:21,505
Rym: And I wonder if it's due to the fact that the comics that made it big early are just these juggernaut behemoths that everyone reads and maybe there's just no room or I don't know.

1014
01:09:21,586 --> 01:09:25,500
Scott: I'd like to I got to think about maybe the way, you know People just don't look for new webcomics.

1015
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:36,038
Rym: or maybe it's hard to find a new webcomic unless you go to those sites where they're all linked together like You damn kid as a bunch of other comics on the side or a dumbbrella or things like that.

1016
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,046
Scott: It's just really hard to make an.

1017
01:09:38,327 --> 01:09:47,193
Scott: you know, if the thing is a lot of the good webcomic artists are Already making webcomics and they're not making new ones.

1018
01:09:47,214 --> 01:09:48,680
Scott: They're making more of the same comic.

1019
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:49,542
Scott: I mean penny arcade.

1020
01:09:49,563 --> 01:09:57,888
Scott: they just they're just keep making penny arcade for years and years and years and there aren't that many New webcomic artists, you know because it was.

1021
01:09:58,169 --> 01:10:01,440
Scott: it broke out where there was, you know, all of a sudden there's a new thing.

1022
01:10:01,962 --> 01:10:18,840
Scott: So every webcomic artist in the world, they didn't know they were webcomic artists yet they all broke out simultaneously, so there were hundreds and hundreds of webcomics, but you know The rate at which new webcomic artists are generated is years and years and years For actually good ones to come through the line.

1023
01:10:19,322 --> 01:10:23,720
Rym: But anyway, I hate to push us along but we've gone a long time talking about this con and we still got a lot to say.

1024
01:10:23,901 --> 01:10:24,925
Scott: Okay, so let's move on.

1025
01:10:25,006 --> 01:10:26,915
Rym: Yeah, we might have to cover the rest of it tomorrow.

1026
01:10:26,975 --> 01:10:28,680
Scott: No, no, we'll finish it All right.

1027
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:33,660
Rym: Anyway, um after that we're gonna skip the next four hours of the con because he played Age of Steam.

1028
01:10:33,801 --> 01:10:35,449
Rym: We played Age of Steam in that four hours.

1029
01:10:35,489 --> 01:10:37,480
Rym: if you want to hear about that listen to yesterday's show.

1030
01:10:38,063 --> 01:10:40,837
Scott: And then we went back to the artists alley to hang out some more.

1031
01:10:40,858 --> 01:10:42,384
Rym: Yep now we were at this point.

1032
01:10:42,424 --> 01:10:43,970
Rym: we were going to leave the con.

1033
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:49,045
Rym: our friend Kat had already left because she found a ride home and Our friend Yuko and Brian.

1034
01:10:49,105 --> 01:10:51,132
Rym: they were out getting dinner or something.

1035
01:10:51,514 --> 01:10:52,256
Rym: So I called them.

1036
01:10:52,317 --> 01:10:53,260
Rym: They're like, hey reading really?

1037
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:56,840
Rym: I was like, hey, we're gonna leave soon and oh we miss you all.

1038
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:57,338
Rym: We'll see you soon.

1039
01:10:57,683 --> 01:10:58,813
Rym: Then I go and meet Scott cuz.

1040
01:10:58,854 --> 01:11:08,686
Rym: he was still Cleaning up the Age of Steam game while I was going to see what was going on with our friends And then we decided that we might as well stick around until they get back and hang out and then leave because we're in no Rush.

1041
01:11:08,850 --> 01:11:09,033
Scott: Mm-hmm.

1042
01:11:09,483 --> 01:11:15,905
Rym: And I gotta say After those two got back and we hung out in the artist colony for the rest of the night We had some good times.

1043
01:11:16,388 --> 01:11:18,116
Rym: That was probably the highlight of the con.

1044
01:11:18,558 --> 01:11:21,947
Scott: probably Yeah, just the part I remember the most besides playing Age of Steam.

1045
01:11:22,167 --> 01:11:37,154
Scott: just me Scott Brian and Yuko hanging out talking about everything Talking about like we met lots of people walking by and the thing was is when people came by I struck try to strike up Conversations with them, you know about because you're promoting their comic and our podcast.

1046
01:11:37,194 --> 01:11:42,973
Rym: Yeah, because actually Yuko had a table and In the artist colony, but she didn't really bring much to do with it.

1047
01:11:43,053 --> 01:11:44,520
Rym: So she offered it to us to use.

1048
01:11:44,709 --> 01:11:44,838
Scott: Yep.

1049
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:50,940
Scott: So we were promoting our podcast in their comic and I asked people do you listen to podcasts and are you going to Otakon now?

1050
01:11:51,241 --> 01:11:54,097
Scott: This and I expected people to say what's a podcast?

1051
01:11:54,258 --> 01:11:55,785
Scott: Hell's yes I'm going to Otakon.

1052
01:11:56,287 --> 01:12:00,753
Scott: the thing is is that pretty much everyone said yeah I listen to a few podcasts.

1053
01:12:00,955 --> 01:12:08,052
Scott: or oh, yeah I listen to a lot of podcasts or yeah something, you know They definitely were into podcasting and no I can't go to Otakon.

1054
01:12:08,112 --> 01:12:09,156
Scott: or what's Otakon?

1055
01:12:09,216 --> 01:12:10,580
Scott: or where is Otakon?

1056
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:16,699
Rym: More people didn't know what Otakon was or where it was or anything about it then knew about it.

1057
01:12:17,024 --> 01:12:22,315
Scott: But they all knew Podcasting and I said, yeah If you want to listen to us two schmucks talk you can go to that website.

1058
01:12:22,436 --> 01:12:25,066
Scott: and now the guy was like I love listen to geeks talk.

1059
01:12:25,487 --> 01:12:29,040
Rym: I have a theory and I'm gonna talk about this in depth someday.

1060
01:12:29,141 --> 01:12:31,696
Rym: Maybe someone should remind me hypothesis when I forget.

1061
01:12:32,018 --> 01:12:36,660
Rym: Yes Well theory in the colloquial sense hypothesis in the scientific sense exactly.

1062
01:12:36,983 --> 01:12:47,511
Rym: But it seems to me based on all of my anecdotal evidence and all my many years are going to cons that there are Circles of people like in burning wheel who go to certain sets of cons.

1063
01:12:47,912 --> 01:12:56,160
Rym: because for the longest time I went to Otakon Anime Central Otakon anime central and a lot of the same people went to both.

1064
01:12:56,581 --> 01:13:02,663
Rym: So I met people at anime central and then I'd hang out with him at Otakon and then I hang out with him again At the next anime central.

1065
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:05,813
Rym: then I discovered that Katsucon is in the same circle.

1066
01:13:06,154 --> 01:13:10,007
Rym: when I went to Katsucon almost everyone I talked to goes to Otakon.

1067
01:13:10,247 --> 01:13:14,180
Scott: a lot of people were well because that's in closed geographical proximity to Otakon.

1068
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,969
Rym: So true true, but and uber khan?

1069
01:13:17,230 --> 01:13:30,239
Rym: a lot of people who go to Otakon and all these cons go to uber khan But almost no one who goes to like ConnectiCon and anime next and all these other circle of cons goes to Otakon or Katsucon.

1070
01:13:30,259 --> 01:13:38,440
Rym: and I'm really not sure exactly if it's distance or time and I've got to sit down and think about it and look at maps and See if I can come up with any rationale for this.

1071
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:43,000
Rym: But it's like the people who go to all the small cons don't go to the big cons.

1072
01:13:43,282 --> 01:13:45,520
Scott: I think that it's really just a geographic thing.

1073
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:54,978
Scott: Like you could put blobs on the map as to where the fan Populations live my own and then you can see aha this percentage of that one goes to these cons.

1074
01:13:55,038 --> 01:14:00,540
Rym: and you know My only argument against that is that anime central is definitely in the Otakon Katsucon circle.

1075
01:14:00,822 --> 01:14:02,320
Rym: Yeah, and that is fuck far away.

1076
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:05,520
Scott: Well, at least the people that you talk to I mean there are thousands of people at these things.

1077
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:08,152
Scott: There's no way that you can actually figure that out.

1078
01:14:08,192 --> 01:14:08,474
Scott: Hence.

1079
01:14:08,534 --> 01:14:16,840
Rym: It was the the Weak-weak hypothesis based on anecdotal evidence and I'm gonna I think I'll do a search for the truth to try to figure this out.

1080
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:17,744
Scott: Maybe all right.

1081
01:14:17,884 --> 01:14:21,118
Scott: Anyway, some other funny things happened while we were sitting there hanging out.

1082
01:14:21,439 --> 01:14:26,140
Scott: Yep We met some annoying fanboys came up and they bothered us and we got them to go away.

1083
01:14:26,241 --> 01:14:28,900
Rym: Yep, we discovered the best way to promote GeekNights.

1084
01:14:29,562 --> 01:14:33,793
Rym: We were sitting there and we were talking to rusty holler who is.

1085
01:14:34,134 --> 01:14:36,786
Rym: he was a guest at the con and he did all sorts Of cool things.

1086
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:38,120
Rym: I'm not gonna try to read this.

1087
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:52,113
Scott: Yeah, he was a comic artist and he makes some comic called ace and Queenie Which I looked at it and you know, the art was pretty good music good artist, you know But it's sort of an anthropomorphic thing published in furlough.

1088
01:14:52,253 --> 01:14:54,240
Scott: So make of that what you will.

1089
01:14:55,261 --> 01:15:01,683
Rym: But the thing is he totally surprised us with his awesome knowledge of anime and we had a really good discussion of all the old School awesome anime.

1090
01:15:01,864 --> 01:15:05,696
Scott: Yeah at first it's like oh, it's a comic artist who draws something furry.

1091
01:15:05,957 --> 01:15:06,900
Scott: Oh, wait a minute.

1092
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:09,837
Scott: He wants to talk about all sorts of awesome Tezuka stuff that I don't know.

1093
01:15:09,937 --> 01:15:14,019
Scott: Yes Yes, me and your wise ways of the Tezuka things that I do not have yet.

1094
01:15:14,452 --> 01:15:31,100
Rym: Yep now the cool thing is we were talking to him and we're you know loud boisterous people and he was pretty loud to people walking by would stop and start listening to us and Then once they started listening to us we could impress upon them that hey we do a show.

1095
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:36,400
Rym: You can listen to this all the time and that got more people interested in GeekNights than anything we've ever done at a con.

1096
01:15:36,841 --> 01:15:39,890
Scott: I was so entertained just standing here listening to you.

1097
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:43,320
Scott: two guys talk and now I can do it four days a week.

1098
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:45,368
Rym: Yeah, one person even said something along those lines.

1099
01:15:45,408 --> 01:15:46,472
Rym: Like I would listen to this.

1100
01:15:46,953 --> 01:15:48,700
Rym: Yep, and I was like, well now you can.

1101
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:49,386
Rym: Here's a website.

1102
01:15:49,587 --> 01:16:00,147
Scott: Yeah, and they were like, oh You know people like, you know, usually you give us, you know it's like when someone gives me a piece of paper and says go check this out, I'm like, yeah and obviously, I know that they're.

1103
01:16:00,328 --> 01:16:17,002
Scott: they know that I'm probably not gonna and You know I think that's why I don't hand things out because I always figure people are gonna be like yeah and not actually go see it And it's a waste of time, but it seemed like everyone who I gave a flyer or whatever was genuinely interested.

1104
01:16:17,063 --> 01:16:29,509
Rym: like most of the flyers we gave away were because people asked us specifically how they could listen or How they could get in touch with us or if we had a business card or a flyer Mm-hmm, or they'd ask like can I have one of those?

1105
01:16:29,529 --> 01:16:31,899
Scott: Yeah, it's like they thought it wasn't free.

1106
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:36,660
Rym: Also, we got some compliments on it because also Yuko who we were hanging out with she did the art for it.

1107
01:16:37,023 --> 01:16:38,660
Rym: I finally uploaded it to the server.

1108
01:16:38,801 --> 01:16:45,304
Rym: So anyone who wants to promote GeekNights in any con you go to you can just print out that flyer Make some copies cut it up.

1109
01:16:45,344 --> 01:16:45,785
Rym: Give it out.

1110
01:16:46,106 --> 01:16:46,889
Rym: Mm-hmm.

1111
01:16:47,109 --> 01:16:48,233
Rym: You don't have to we don't care.

1112
01:16:48,293 --> 01:16:51,743
Scott: But yeah now another funny thing Happened while we were there.

1113
01:16:51,803 --> 01:16:52,144
Rym: Okay.

1114
01:16:52,465 --> 01:17:02,860
Rym: Now I was talking about the uber web comics panel while we were in the artist alley Yep, the artist colony and at one point one of the artists said something about furrydom.

1115
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:04,987
Rym: now The question was what is what?

1116
01:17:05,047 --> 01:17:05,469
Rym: what is there?

1117
01:17:05,489 --> 01:17:05,991
Rym: anything you want?

1118
01:17:06,031 --> 01:17:07,476
Scott: point at the uber comic panel?

1119
01:17:07,516 --> 01:17:08,720
Scott: Someone said something about furry.

1120
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:10,588
Rym: Yeah well first there was a question of you were coming panel.

1121
01:17:10,608 --> 01:17:14,216
Rym: that led to this where they asked like what do you hate or like What do you hate about doing a comic?

1122
01:17:14,257 --> 01:17:14,419
Rym: or wait?

1123
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:16,419
Rym: Well, like have you ever gotten hate mail something like that?

1124
01:17:16,780 --> 01:17:18,004
Rym: Mm-hmm, and there were funny stories.

1125
01:17:18,365 --> 01:17:25,233
Rym: and then this one webcomic artist says and I didn't recognize her comic or anything And she said I'm not even sure which comic it is.

1126
01:17:25,273 --> 01:17:28,386
Scott: now that I'm looking through the con guide I'm trying to figure out which one and I can't.

1127
01:17:28,647 --> 01:17:29,830
Rym: she said something about.

1128
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:46,711
Rym: I hate it when people see a comic that is anthropomorphic art and associate it with furry culture and went on this whole rant about like yif piles or fur piles and all that stuff and the crowd was like grumble grumble grumble grumble grumble and there was.

1129
01:17:46,852 --> 01:17:58,546
Rym: there were a lot of disparaging comments made in the picto chat and after she stopped there was a silence for a while like it really killed the momentum and One I guess The story I was gonna tell.

1130
01:17:58,687 --> 01:18:02,622
Rym: and I was telling this to everyone who didn't go to the uber con uber comic God.

1131
01:18:02,842 --> 01:18:07,496
Rym: the uber comic web comic the uber webcomic panel at Connecticut not uber con.

1132
01:18:08,037 --> 01:18:08,960
Rym: I'm not gonna cut that out.

1133
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,194
Rym: I'm gonna leave that in for all of you who you.

1134
01:18:11,234 --> 01:18:14,951
Rym: we don't edit the show much But that was a spectacular stumbling over a word.

1135
01:18:14,991 --> 01:18:15,573
Rym: I'm proud of it.

1136
01:18:15,934 --> 01:18:17,440
Scott: Okay, that was a new enterprise.

1137
01:18:17,982 --> 01:18:25,069
Rym: Alright, so the uber webcomics panel and I was gonna use that as an example of how a good MC Could have kept the momentum going.

1138
01:18:25,390 --> 01:18:40,125
Rym: but while I was telling the story Before I had gotten even halfway through it this person who is sitting at the adjacent table Drawing and not saying anything turns around and says that was me blah blah blah Blah blah.

1139
01:18:40,306 --> 01:18:41,472
Scott: I thought she just said fuck you.

1140
01:18:41,592 --> 01:18:42,617
Rym: Yeah, it was a really like.

1141
01:18:42,637 --> 01:18:43,120
Rym: she was pissed.

1142
01:18:43,381 --> 01:18:47,340
Rym: Yeah, and I think she thought that I was really gonna rag on her about furried him or something.

1143
01:18:47,581 --> 01:18:48,947
Scott: Well, we were kind of ragging on her.

1144
01:18:49,028 --> 01:18:51,820
Scott: I was like, did you tell him did you yell out and scream?

1145
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:53,188
Scott: You know screw you furries.

1146
01:18:53,208 --> 01:18:57,099
Scott: Did he yell out and you know, yep I hope you're saying bad stuff about furries.

1147
01:18:57,534 --> 01:18:58,382
Rym: Yep and I'll.

1148
01:18:58,723 --> 01:19:01,030
Rym: I would like to do a show on this at some point because because

1149
01:19:01,130 --> 01:19:03,397
Scott: burries deserve bad stuff being said because

1150
01:19:03,558 --> 01:19:16,131
Rym: this is a it's a thing that's actually coming up more and more at conventions and it's getting to the point where Anime con people who run conventions have to deal with this that there is anthropomorphic art Which I actually am a big fan of there.

1151
01:19:16,191 --> 01:19:21,354
Rym: and then there is furry Culture which is a whole different arena.

1152
01:19:21,635 --> 01:19:27,918
Rym: That is more of a fetish culture than an art culture and people confuse the two.

1153
01:19:27,938 --> 01:19:38,956
Rym: and The problem is that people who are a member of the non perverted part seem to feel really persecuted And as a result tend to be very vocal and as a result tend to be very annoying.

1154
01:19:38,976 --> 01:19:45,160
Rym: and as a result There's a lot of hate some of it warranted and some of it unwarranted for furries out there.

1155
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:48,252
Scott: Yeah, because it starts out with a hate against the furry culture.

1156
01:19:48,293 --> 01:19:57,600
Rym: that's perverted sex fetish Yeah, and it's not like, you know Like it's a. it's a fetish where I can see these psychological roots in many cases being not good.

1157
01:19:57,881 --> 01:20:05,140
Rym: Yeah, as opposed to something like BDSM where I don't really care, you know, like I don't I don't begrudge anyone their fetish.

1158
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,384
Scott: I mean whatever floats your boat.

1159
01:20:06,706 --> 01:20:12,247
Scott: The problem is is you know, if the culture around your fetish is Not good.

1160
01:20:12,388 --> 01:20:12,589
Rym: Yes.

1161
01:20:12,629 --> 01:20:14,820
Rym: It has nothing to do with the fact that it's anthropomorphic.

1162
01:20:14,961 --> 01:20:18,959
Scott: Yeah, I mean you can still do it all you want, but I'm going to make fun of you.

1163
01:20:19,534 --> 01:20:21,505
Scott: Yes That is what I am going to do.

1164
01:20:21,907 --> 01:20:26,645
Scott: and really the beef is and I am also not going to respect you or be friends with You.

1165
01:20:27,176 --> 01:20:34,860
Rym: yes and I mean just the beef here is that We're not saying anything about anthropomorphic art or furry art or whatever or even about the people who get off on that.

1166
01:20:35,201 --> 01:20:49,939
Rym: It's about the culture of people who have a fetish and they're very vocal about having the fetish and then they wonder Why people bother them about it because if you are very vocal about having any fetish There's a lot of people are going to bother you about it.

1167
01:20:50,301 --> 01:21:05,759
Scott: Yeah, most people who have fetishes besides furriness like, you know, SNM people very few of them go around You know yelling about how I'm an SNM guy Except when they go to their conventions, yeah, you know, it's like they just keep it.

1168
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:10,080
Scott: You know that they're normal people except for when they're doing their thing, which is when you're not around.

1169
01:21:10,401 --> 01:21:12,768
Scott: They don't you know, they don't care to get you involved.

1170
01:21:12,788 --> 01:21:13,651
Scott: there's nothing to do with you.

1171
01:21:14,172 --> 01:21:21,400
Scott: furries kind of like push their fetish out and They're fans of this art, which is also trying to push itself as art.

1172
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:26,140
Scott: So it's sort of like they're dragging this bad baggage along with them for the ride.

1173
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:31,920
Rym: It's like we've got good independent comics coming out in America now, but there's also all the underwear perfect comics.

1174
01:21:32,341 --> 01:21:35,313
Rym: So when someone says hey, do you read comics?

1175
01:21:35,795 --> 01:21:37,240
Rym: to someone new who doesn't read comics?

1176
01:21:37,582 --> 01:21:41,560
Rym: They think of the underwear perfect comics and they don't know about their good comics.

1177
01:21:41,782 --> 01:21:43,058
Rym: Yep, it's the same deal.

1178
01:21:43,561 --> 01:21:50,799
Rym: but and then she like she just yelled at us and then turned away and the whole area is silent and we're all like.

1179
01:21:51,363 --> 01:21:58,548
Scott: That was awkward And I was like we're gonna talk about that on the show and here we are.

1180
01:21:58,568 --> 01:22:05,760
Rym: and then we just kind of Picked back up with our conversation and then everyone else kind of picked back up and she just sat there for a while.

1181
01:22:06,122 --> 01:22:07,148
Scott: I was like, what's she gonna do?

1182
01:22:07,188 --> 01:22:08,435
Scott: She's just some furry girl.

1183
01:22:08,455 --> 01:22:16,248
Rym: Yeah But then I apologize afterward because I tried to explain to her that I was actually going somewhere with that And I wasn't disparaging you.

1184
01:22:16,268 --> 01:22:17,919
Rym: I don't even know your comic never heard of it.

1185
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:20,787
Scott: Yeah, I hate that when people take something personally.

1186
01:22:21,168 --> 01:22:32,340
Scott: if someone doesn't know you it's not possible for them to give a personal Insult, you know, it's like if you we don't know who this girl is You still don't know her name or what comic she draws or anything?

1187
01:22:32,823 --> 01:22:36,000
Scott: So, how is it possible for us to personally insult her?

1188
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:38,648
Scott: Obviously, we're talking about something else.

1189
01:22:39,030 --> 01:22:43,827
Rym: No, if she if you happen to be listening At some point I just burped.

1190
01:22:44,108 --> 01:22:47,840
Rym: we are going to do a show on furrydom because I did someone put that in the forum.

1191
01:22:48,165 --> 01:22:52,869
Rym: yes, but the thing is Since we've got this Skype set up.

1192
01:22:52,889 --> 01:22:54,035
Rym: That's probably going to work.

1193
01:22:54,055 --> 01:22:55,000
Rym: We're gonna test it tomorrow.

1194
01:22:55,101 --> 01:23:03,600
Rym: Probably I wouldn't mind having you and other people like that on the show When we do time if you're listening and you don't hate us even if you hate us we want hate mail.

1195
01:23:04,162 --> 01:23:05,446
Rym: Yeah, you've never gotten hate mail.

1196
01:23:05,466 --> 01:23:06,349
Rym: We're waiting for it.

1197
01:23:06,630 --> 01:23:11,125
Rym: If you want to call in and yell at us for 20 minutes We'll put that right on the air.

1198
01:23:11,527 --> 01:23:17,648
Scott: Oh, that'll go in the air so much faster than like Riven Scott are the best That you know Riven Scott are the best.

1199
01:23:17,688 --> 01:23:20,500
Scott: we'll just kind of stay on our hard drives and get listened to once a day.

1200
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:27,196
Scott: But yeah Riven Scott our assholes who should die is gonna get put on the air You'll get an interview right away and no faking it.

1201
01:23:27,236 --> 01:23:28,863
Scott: We can tell Yep, yep.

1202
01:23:28,903 --> 01:23:37,814
Rym: Yep, because really we we want to get opposing viewpoints out because when we argue with each other We always argue over the same things and I know a lot of our listeners like the arguments.

1203
01:23:38,195 --> 01:23:41,569
Rym: the best way for you to hear An argument is for you to hear us arguing with someone else.

1204
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:46,447
Scott: Yeah, because it's a tag team effort, you know And I don't want to say this.

1205
01:23:46,547 --> 01:23:54,360
Scott: but if me and Rym agree on whatever it is We're not gonna use evil editing tactics like some people on TV and radio.

1206
01:23:55,022 --> 01:24:04,054
Scott: But if someone comes up against us and it's us versus them The chances of them winning are not good.

1207
01:24:04,556 --> 01:24:05,780
Scott: now me and Rym agree.

1208
01:24:05,941 --> 01:24:08,822
Rym: Honestly, it really doesn't even depend on the kind of debate I mean.

1209
01:24:08,842 --> 01:24:16,960
Rym: there is debate where people are trying to come to a truth Wherein I think we will prove our point but perfectly or near enough for the other person has no recourse.

1210
01:24:17,301 --> 01:24:24,650
Rym: There is also debate where you're trying to win over a crowd, which I think we have pretty well down Considering the crowd is fans of us.

1211
01:24:25,313 --> 01:24:27,040
Scott: It's not hard to win you guys over.

1212
01:24:27,321 --> 01:24:30,360
Rym: Well also just that Scott is better at the former and I'm better at the latter.

1213
01:24:30,761 --> 01:24:35,980
Rym: So if we agree on something we can use all of those tools combined like a giant robot.

1214
01:24:36,322 --> 01:24:46,779
Scott: Yeah, it's sort of like if you want to see a very Mike Tyson fight in argument form Try to argue against both of us in something.

1215
01:24:47,662 --> 01:24:52,280
Rym: Yep, and some people on the forums is seen though It's more difficult on the forums because I can't check it so often.

1216
01:24:52,400 --> 01:25:00,080
Rym: So I'll see an argument that I think is bad and before I can respond to it ten people post and then alright I'm not gonna dig up old news, whatever

1217
01:25:00,421 --> 01:25:04,820
Scott: I mean, yeah, if you want to see an example look at the sports argument that we had today in the forum

1218
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:07,089
Rym: Yep, or the libertarianism argument.

1219
01:25:07,169 --> 01:25:08,615
Scott: All right, let's finish the con.

1220
01:25:09,117 --> 01:25:09,640
Scott: All right, okay.

1221
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:18,269
Scott: So we hung out for a few hours more hanging out talking with cool people about cool stuff And then we finally said, okay, we must go.

1222
01:25:18,811 --> 01:25:20,315
Rym: All right now we're leaving.

1223
01:25:20,436 --> 01:25:21,840
Rym: the con doesn't go 24/7.

1224
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:23,652
Rym: It was gonna close down in an hour at 1 a.m.

1225
01:25:23,712 --> 01:25:24,014
Scott: Or so.

1226
01:25:24,195 --> 01:25:27,102
Scott: Yeah, and it was like 1145 ish.

1227
01:25:27,724 --> 01:25:29,169
Scott: now we found the car.

1228
01:25:29,449 --> 01:25:37,000
Rym: what is about to happen is not the fault of the con But remember when I said to remember something at the beginning of this rant.

1229
01:25:37,462 --> 01:25:42,559
Scott: Yep, we go we get in the car and we leave the parking lot.

1230
01:25:42,599 --> 01:25:49,025
Scott: now There is a guy in a booth at the exits of the parking lot and there's like six cars in front of us trying to Get out and they're not moving.

1231
01:25:49,406 --> 01:25:51,252
Scott: as in they're having to stop and wait.

1232
01:25:51,292 --> 01:25:55,144
Scott: and I'm like what is taking them so long to Pay and get the hell out of here.

1233
01:25:55,224 --> 01:26:00,700
Rym: and it looked like the guy was arguing with every single person in front of us.

1234
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:02,079
Scott: Yeah, we're like what's going on?

1235
01:26:02,180 --> 01:26:10,348
Scott: And then I remembered oh I paid already and we paid as soon as we got into the parking lot for eight Dollars all day.

1236
01:26:10,449 --> 01:26:11,473
Scott: and I said wait a minute.

1237
01:26:11,674 --> 01:26:14,642
Scott: I looked at the clock and it said 1158.

1238
01:26:14,642 --> 01:26:16,268
Rym: I was like son of a bitch.

1239
01:26:16,308 --> 01:26:24,816
Rym: if they try to charge us because they made us wait in line past the deadline We're driving through that dead block and I sure as hell was gonna drive right through that stick.

1240
01:26:24,856 --> 01:26:25,478
Scott: They got nothing.

1241
01:26:25,558 --> 01:26:31,420
Scott: So I got up there and I hand the guy the ticket and what does he say?

1242
01:26:31,540 --> 01:26:35,476
Scott: He says not what I expect which is this expired a minute ago.

1243
01:26:35,497 --> 01:26:36,300
Scott: You have to pay money.

1244
01:26:36,481 --> 01:26:39,522
Scott: It was this expired at 8 p.m To which

1245
01:26:39,603 --> 01:26:49,206
Rym: Scott immediately says the lady this morning said it was all Day and the guy looked at us and I think he got the hint that we were not going to back down And he said

1246
01:26:49,348 --> 01:26:55,698
Scott: whatever he got here He called someone on his walkie-talkie and he had them push a button which opened the gate and we left

1247
01:26:56,099 --> 01:26:56,260
Rym: now

1248
01:26:56,602 --> 01:26:59,599
Scott: And I would not have given him a goddamn penny.

1249
01:26:59,639 --> 01:27:04,281
Rym: now I saw that some of the people in front of us argued and argued and didn't pay but I saw that a lot of people Did.

1250
01:27:04,842 --> 01:27:18,384
Rym: either the convention center was trying to rip these anime fans off by being very very Misrepresentative of the cost of parking or Someone was incompetent.

1251
01:27:18,865 --> 01:27:19,126
Scott: Yep.

1252
01:27:19,346 --> 01:27:20,289
Scott: There was it was really.

1253
01:27:20,309 --> 01:27:24,340
Scott: I think what it was is that you know the convention center, you know.

1254
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:29,820
Scott: They basically said yeah these people you should give a deal for like all-day parking a flat fee and you know.

1255
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:30,898
Scott: They thought that was a good idea.

1256
01:27:31,504 --> 01:27:41,885
Scott: But I don't think the people in the parking lot Management realized that the con went until one so that if you wanted to give an all-day parking you would have had to give someone Parking from the right hours.

1257
01:27:41,925 --> 01:27:42,767
Scott: there wasn't enough.

1258
01:27:43,148 --> 01:27:50,892
Scott: there obviously wasn't a significant amount of communication and coordination between the convention and the parking and such.

1259
01:27:51,273 --> 01:27:57,800
Rym: I was kind of disappointed because I saw that Everyone in front of us argued with this guy at length and I was waiting to argue.

1260
01:27:58,201 --> 01:28:06,750
Rym: I was all ready to call the police and tell them that a parking garage that we had already paid for was refusing to let Us leave and create some all sorts of a shitstorm.

1261
01:28:07,051 --> 01:28:14,133
Scott: Mm-hmm and the guy backed right down and yeah I was like the lady said this morning that this was for all day.

1262
01:28:14,234 --> 01:28:14,675
Rym: Yes.

1263
01:28:14,695 --> 01:28:16,240
Rym: That was Scott priming.

1264
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:31,553
Rym: I could tell because his voice changes when he's about to start an argument because he'll stop and very calmly He will say the crux of the argument the point at which if he'd if anyone disagrees with this point The argument will begin and I could see it in his eyes.

1265
01:28:31,594 --> 01:28:32,578
Rym: He was waiting for it.

1266
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:34,946
Rym: Yeah, and I was all ready to back him up.

1267
01:28:35,548 --> 01:28:39,280
Scott: I had my cell phone out and the guy opened the gate and we left.

1268
01:28:40,933 --> 01:28:43,626
Scott: so Let that be a lesson to all of you.

1269
01:28:43,907 --> 01:28:47,980
Scott: learn our ways and you will escape from parking lots with wallets intact.

1270
01:28:48,181 --> 01:28:53,522
Rym: In fact at for the red Otakon last won't even have to open your Jimmy Otakon.

1271
01:28:53,542 --> 01:28:54,806
Rym: parking is very expensive.

1272
01:28:54,886 --> 01:28:56,171
Rym: second only to Katsucon.

1273
01:28:56,311 --> 01:28:57,174
Scott: Oh mad expensive.

1274
01:28:57,315 --> 01:28:58,198
Scott: Oh, it's a great story.

1275
01:28:58,238 --> 01:28:58,860
Scott: We got to tell it, right?

1276
01:28:59,020 --> 01:29:00,765
Rym: Yes, I think we told it once before but whatever.

1277
01:29:01,186 --> 01:29:07,105
Rym: so we we stay Thursday morning through Sunday afternoon At Otakon.

1278
01:29:07,165 --> 01:29:09,940
Scott: now we park in the parking lot attached to our hotel.

1279
01:29:10,281 --> 01:29:15,518
Rym: Very expensive like it costs like between 40 and 60 dollars depending on various factors.

1280
01:29:15,579 --> 01:29:22,440
Scott: every year For four days of just moving your car your car sits in there for a long time.

1281
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:24,240
Rym: Yeah, cuz it's a primo parking place.

1282
01:29:24,340 --> 01:29:27,033
Rym: I mean you could park cheaper far away, but we don't care.

1283
01:29:27,174 --> 01:29:31,772
Rym: even when we were dirt poor We would park there and then not have because it was just so convenient.

1284
01:29:31,813 --> 01:29:32,555
Scott: We didn't care.

1285
01:29:32,575 --> 01:29:33,679
Scott: Let them rip us off.

1286
01:29:34,143 --> 01:29:35,517
Rym: So we lost that.

1287
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:40,820
Rym: Well, I lost the ticket that you have to use to prove how long you were in there and I actually lost it.

1288
01:29:40,820 --> 01:29:41,924
Rym: This wasn't a scam though.

1289
01:29:42,005 --> 01:29:42,145
Rym: Now.

1290
01:29:42,205 --> 01:29:43,490
Rym: I know that I can make it a scam.

1291
01:29:43,531 --> 01:29:47,968
Rym: Yep, and I pull up to the booth And it's Sunday and we're about to drive to Wildwood.

1292
01:29:48,028 --> 01:29:52,695
Rym: So we're like, whatever we'll pay whatever stupid fine They want us to pay and get the hell out of here.

1293
01:29:52,937 --> 01:29:57,960
Rym: Yep So roll down the window and he's like take it and I'm like I lost the ticket and he's like, when did you get here?

1294
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:01,712
Rym: I was like Thursday morning and he stands there for a second doesn't say anything.

1295
01:30:01,732 --> 01:30:09,959
Rym: then he says 20 bucks and I said Alright, and I gave him 20 bucks and he waved me through and I'm reasonably certain that he pocketed it.

1296
01:30:10,762 --> 01:30:18,307
Scott: I think the strategy here is if there's ever parking lots where you get a ticket on the way in And you pay on the way out

1297
01:30:18,688 --> 01:30:20,031
Rym: and it's not in your hometown

1298
01:30:20,172 --> 01:30:26,310
Scott: and it's not in your hometown or anywhere near your home Somewhere you're not likely to park again frequently.

1299
01:30:26,350 --> 01:30:28,396
Scott: I mean we park in this place annually.

1300
01:30:28,416 --> 01:30:29,900
Scott: They're not gonna remember us for shit.

1301
01:30:29,981 --> 01:30:31,594
Rym: Plus we take a different car every year.

1302
01:30:31,614 --> 01:30:34,032
Scott: Yeah, I know different car everything.

1303
01:30:34,052 --> 01:30:36,967
Scott: we Go there at the exit.

1304
01:30:37,589 --> 01:30:40,900
Scott: throw your ticket like in like a bin somewhere, right?

1305
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:42,828
Scott: But don't lose it but pretend to lose it.

1306
01:30:42,909 --> 01:30:45,320
Scott: hide it in your glove box cuz you want to have it as a backup.

1307
01:30:45,541 --> 01:30:47,932
Scott: Yeah, so go up and say I lost my ticket.

1308
01:30:47,972 --> 01:30:48,434
Scott: I can't find.

1309
01:30:48,656 --> 01:30:49,580
Scott: I can't find my ticket.

1310
01:30:50,101 --> 01:30:56,960
Scott: And if they say when did you get here, you know say the trick here is like if they say when did you get here?

1311
01:30:57,621 --> 01:31:00,820
Scott: It's are you gonna say be honest or are you gonna say this morning?

1312
01:31:01,220 --> 01:31:05,400
Rym: Cuz you have to be willing to go all the way with whatever you just tried.

1313
01:31:05,621 --> 01:31:10,380
Rym: Because if you say this morning and he says I have video of you driving in Wednesday, you're fucked.

1314
01:31:10,983 --> 01:31:13,895
Scott: Yeah, if he says, you know, well you need to find the ticket.

1315
01:31:13,935 --> 01:31:15,060
Scott: Can you look for it?

1316
01:31:15,140 --> 01:31:15,924
Scott: Maybe it can't be.

1317
01:31:15,944 --> 01:31:17,934
Scott: you know, you parked in here and you didn't go anywhere.

1318
01:31:18,054 --> 01:31:19,240
Scott: How far could the ticket have gone?

1319
01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:22,191
Scott: Yeah, so if there and then you take the ticket out and he sees that you lied.

1320
01:31:22,211 --> 01:31:24,580
Rym: Oh, I recommend not lying.

1321
01:31:24,861 --> 01:31:26,631
Scott: I also recommend not lying now.

1322
01:31:26,952 --> 01:31:32,180
Rym: the key you got to play up here Is that this guy is probably making minimum wage or thereabouts?

1323
01:31:32,961 --> 01:31:42,117
Rym: So if he lets you go and you pay like half of what you owed But he just keeps it that just tripled his hourly wage.

1324
01:31:42,982 --> 01:31:44,929
Rym: Uh-huh, so and he has no incentive.

1325
01:31:44,949 --> 01:31:48,480
Scott: He doesn't care and the guy who owns the parking lot is making megabucks.

1326
01:31:48,741 --> 01:31:53,374
Scott: Anyway, so you're kind of stealing but you're not doing the stealing kind of steam.

1327
01:31:53,414 --> 01:31:55,600
Scott: you are going to pay the honest price.

1328
01:31:55,882 --> 01:31:58,520
Scott: It's the guy in the little booth who's doing this.

1329
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:03,180
Rym: Yeah, I gotta say that is the same logic from American gods when they pull like the violin scan.

1330
01:32:03,461 --> 01:32:04,464
Scott: I know isn't it great?

1331
01:32:04,544 --> 01:32:04,865
Scott: It is.

1332
01:32:05,046 --> 01:32:05,748
Scott: It's perfect.

1333
01:32:05,828 --> 01:32:06,611
Scott: It's flawless.

1334
01:32:06,731 --> 01:32:07,955
Scott: There's not a single hole.

1335
01:32:07,975 --> 01:32:09,480
Scott: It is cheddar not Swiss.

1336
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,586
Rym: No, here's the legal side.

1337
01:32:12,887 --> 01:32:15,777
Rym: I do not actually geek dice does not recommend you attempt this.

1338
01:32:15,817 --> 01:32:16,600
Rym: it is against the law.

1339
01:32:17,202 --> 01:32:19,569
Scott: It's not actually against the law.

1340
01:32:19,630 --> 01:32:21,977
Rym: It depends on how you go about it exactly.

1341
01:32:22,037 --> 01:32:26,149
Scott: if you lie It's probably kind of in the gray area.

1342
01:32:26,210 --> 01:32:27,253
Rym: Don't rationalize it.

1343
01:32:27,293 --> 01:32:29,860
Rym: You you are stealing just whatever.

1344
01:32:30,522 --> 01:32:35,114
Rym: I'm just noting that by accident we ended up paying far less than we should have.

1345
01:32:35,455 --> 01:32:35,716
Scott: Yes.

1346
01:32:35,856 --> 01:32:37,200
Scott: This is a completely honest.

1347
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:38,444
Scott: We weren't trying to scam.

1348
01:32:38,484 --> 01:32:43,499
Scott: we literally lost the ticket and we said when we got there honestly and the guy said 20 bucks.

1349
01:32:44,462 --> 01:32:45,949
Scott: So we gave him 20 bucks and we left.

1350
01:32:46,210 --> 01:32:48,500
Rym: Yep, and I even said, you know, we got here Thursday morning.

1351
01:32:48,761 --> 01:32:50,267
Rym: I was all set to pay everything.

1352
01:32:50,488 --> 01:32:50,709
Scott: Yep.

1353
01:32:51,191 --> 01:32:51,453
Rym: Now.

1354
01:32:52,356 --> 01:32:53,220
Scott: I don't have anything pretty much.

1355
01:32:53,341 --> 01:32:56,620
Scott: They can't make you pay more than you legally owe them.

1356
01:32:57,202 --> 01:33:01,280
Scott: You know unless maybe there was like a discount that you're getting they could take away a discount.

1357
01:33:01,420 --> 01:33:06,418
Scott: So if you're already getting a legitimate discount don't go for more because then you'll end up losing what you already got.

1358
01:33:06,739 --> 01:33:12,980
Scott: Yep But they can't charge you more than you know what you're already supposed to be paying.

1359
01:33:12,980 --> 01:33:17,690
Rym: Well, no, cuz some garages have like a $100 flat rate if you lose the ticket.

1360
01:33:17,810 --> 01:33:18,473
Scott: Oh, that is true.

1361
01:33:18,533 --> 01:33:18,915
Scott: That is true.

1362
01:33:18,935 --> 01:33:22,427
Scott: That's when you whip out the ticket You're like, oh here it is right here.

1363
01:33:22,929 --> 01:33:27,383
Scott: You know, if what you do is you drive up here, let's pretend you'll be the Guy, right?

1364
01:33:27,403 --> 01:33:27,985
Scott: All right.

1365
01:33:28,266 --> 01:33:28,547
Scott: Okay.

1366
01:33:29,068 --> 01:33:29,870
Scott: I lost my ticket.

1367
01:33:30,352 --> 01:33:32,157
Rym: No ticket crash.

1368
01:33:32,739 --> 01:33:36,311
Scott: Oh, no No, and then he tells me there's a hundred dollar fine.

1369
01:33:36,351 --> 01:33:38,500
Scott: so I go oh shit, let me try to look for it some more.

1370
01:33:38,540 --> 01:33:38,781
Scott: I can't.

1371
01:33:38,802 --> 01:33:39,646
Scott: I don't have a hundred bucks.

1372
01:33:39,847 --> 01:33:40,370
Scott: I look for it.

1373
01:33:40,450 --> 01:33:41,717
Scott: Oh, I got it.

1374
01:33:41,757 --> 01:33:43,363
Rym: Hooray Fantastic, sir.

1375
01:33:43,384 --> 01:33:46,835
Rym: Yeah, I'm glad you weren't trying to defraud me in any way.

1376
01:33:46,855 --> 01:33:49,402
Rym: Yes your actual bill $60.

1377
01:33:49,402 --> 01:33:49,864
Scott: Here you go.

1378
01:33:49,864 --> 01:33:50,506
Scott: 60 bucks.

1379
01:33:50,546 --> 01:33:51,369
Scott: See you granted.

1380
01:33:51,629 --> 01:33:53,897
Rym: There was also the strategy of now given on.

1381
01:33:53,917 --> 01:33:54,880
Rym: we've never tried any of these.

1382
01:33:54,940 --> 01:33:59,437
Rym: We came up with all of these on the way to Wildwood after we accidentally scammed the guy.

1383
01:33:59,458 --> 01:34:10,172
Rym: Mm-hmm Alright he tells you to look for it rummage around and rummage around and keep rummaging around and act all nervous But don't ever find anything and there's a good chance.

1384
01:34:10,213 --> 01:34:11,819
Rym: the guys can say god, whatever just go.

1385
01:34:12,301 --> 01:34:16,675
Rym: Yeah that that happened to me once when I actually lost a ticket on the New York State Thruway.

1386
01:34:17,117 --> 01:34:18,723
Scott: the worst though Here's the worst.

1387
01:34:18,743 --> 01:34:19,144
Scott: you're ready.

1388
01:34:19,546 --> 01:34:22,296
Scott: the automated parking lots where there are no guys.

1389
01:34:22,356 --> 01:34:23,360
Scott: There's only a gate.

1390
01:34:23,761 --> 01:34:26,911
Rym: They got me with that at Stewart fucking Airport when I didn't fly.

1391
01:34:26,931 --> 01:34:28,115
Scott: Remember when we had to deal with that?

1392
01:34:28,155 --> 01:34:34,615
Scott: in Rochester, New Jillians Little tiny parking lot have enough quarters to open the damn gate.

1393
01:34:34,976 --> 01:34:36,420
Scott: We couldn't get out or in.

1394
01:34:36,660 --> 01:34:38,567
Rym: Yeah, that was fantastic.

1395
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:43,150
Scott: We finally found a quarter under Rym seat and we're like, yeah, I said it like we Was great.

1396
01:34:44,826 --> 01:34:46,799
Scott: We were able to escape the parking lot of doom.

1397
01:34:47,687 --> 01:34:48,858
Rym: Anyway enough about parking.

1398
01:34:49,441 --> 01:34:50,485
Rym: ConnectiCon was alright.

1399
01:34:50,967 --> 01:34:54,360
Rym: It really in my eyes just wasn't worth the money.

1400
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:56,871
Rym: I mean it cost almost pretty much the same as Otakon.

1401
01:34:56,911 --> 01:35:01,939
Rym: yet it had while it had good things going It didn't have enough to justify the cost in my eyes.

1402
01:35:02,020 --> 01:35:10,080
Scott: Yeah and you know since Even though if you took the con if it was run perfectly as in everything there was more staff.

1403
01:35:10,582 --> 01:35:16,230
Scott: You know things were run smoother, you know, they didn't have the some of the problems They had that were easily solved.

1404
01:35:16,472 --> 01:35:22,292
Scott: even if all those things were fixed There wasn't enough happening there to be worth one other thing.

1405
01:35:22,934 --> 01:35:25,000
Rym: their musical guest canceled at the last minute.

1406
01:35:25,222 --> 01:35:25,826
Scott: Oh, yeah, that's right.

1407
01:35:25,947 --> 01:35:27,520
Rym: So they didn't have bad luck performing.

1408
01:35:27,581 --> 01:35:40,140
Rym: Yeah, they had piano squall but I just find it funny that they they're like piano squall appears the musical guest at the anime convention Otakon where he performed for an audience of 3,000. now I just want to say it as a side.

1409
01:35:40,521 --> 01:35:54,484
Rym: It was only 3,000 and that was mostly because piano squall appeared like on Sunday in a non main room At Otakon, I think they might be referring to the time when piano squall they say specifically 2005.

1410
01:35:54,484 --> 01:35:55,175
Scott: Oh, do they really?

1411
01:35:55,215 --> 01:36:03,986
Scott: Yes Okay, because I think at 2004 piano squall performed at the intermission of the cosplay which would have been too much more than 3,000 probably.

1412
01:36:04,006 --> 01:36:08,265
Rym: I guess he's a smart guy and I respect what he does, but I'm not a big fan It's it's not that special.

1413
01:36:08,366 --> 01:36:11,156
Scott: Yeah, it's sort of like oh that guy makes a good something.

1414
01:36:11,196 --> 01:36:12,360
Scott: his works of art are good.

1415
01:36:12,521 --> 01:36:13,384
Scott: I do not enjoy them.

1416
01:36:13,705 --> 01:36:14,207
Scott: Let him be.

1417
01:36:14,227 --> 01:36:17,620
Rym: well, I guess I would enjoy him except it doesn't really change so much.

1418
01:36:17,681 --> 01:36:19,500
Rym: It's just piano squall.

1419
01:36:20,780 --> 01:36:34,960
Rym: Exactly now also there was a masquerade which looked It must have been good because it was standing room only even after more than half of it had elapsed Usually a lot of people walk out of a small cons masquerade about halfway through.

1420
01:36:34,980 --> 01:36:39,334
Scott: Yeah, I knew that the masquerade was going on because the hallways were empty.

1421
01:36:39,856 --> 01:36:46,375
Scott: Of course, there is another Hypothesis I have as to why it was so crowded because the con really didn't I mean an anime.

1422
01:36:46,395 --> 01:36:48,040
Scott: next everything was happening at night.

1423
01:36:48,262 --> 01:36:54,800
Scott: You know during the day there wasn't so much happening But at night the con was happening at ConnectiCon other than the gaming room.

1424
01:36:54,900 --> 01:36:57,068
Scott: The con really wasn't happening at all.

1425
01:36:57,530 --> 01:37:00,540
Scott: So that you know, the masquerade was an actual happening.

1426
01:37:00,661 --> 01:37:04,399
Scott: So everyone flocked to it like finally yes, something is going on.

1427
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:07,394
Rym: Yeah, because honestly there just wasn't much to do for for me.

1428
01:37:08,542 --> 01:37:21,420
Rym: I mean I like going to panels and just not many of the panels really interested me and the fact that the only panel I well the First panel I went to was the anime comic or anime can our club panel that I talked about.

1429
01:37:21,943 --> 01:37:25,000
Rym: That really led me away from wanting to go to any other panels.

1430
01:37:25,436 --> 01:37:40,980
Scott: Yeah I mean if the con had a problem where they didn't have enough panelists and they had to push staff when they were short on Staff into doing panels and to just fill up the schedule Then obviously a lot of the panels aren't probably going to be the best ways to spend my time

1431
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:41,141
Rym: Now.

1432
01:37:41,181 --> 01:37:43,653
Rym: there may or may not been true, but that was the impression I got.

1433
01:37:43,914 --> 01:37:45,120
Scott: that is the impression I got.

1434
01:37:45,582 --> 01:37:47,231
Rym: And also I'll note that they had a dance.

1435
01:37:47,291 --> 01:37:56,419
Scott: Of course that was from one panel Yeah, but that's but also from the horse's mouth of one of the staff people Yep, because she said there were numerous panels like that.

1436
01:37:56,647 --> 01:38:03,125
Rym: Yep and also just people like our friend cat looked at a bunch of panels and said they're all kind of man and No one like.

1437
01:38:03,145 --> 01:38:06,922
Rym: I didn't see anyone coming out of a panel like whoa Yep.

1438
01:38:07,203 --> 01:38:09,313
Scott: Yeah, the panels all seems sparsely populated.

1439
01:38:09,373 --> 01:38:16,620
Scott: people milling in and out and you know Closed doors like the way that the cut the build would walk right past all the panel rooms not know they were there.

1440
01:38:16,922 --> 01:38:18,736
Scott: Yeah, that's another thing is like an Otakon.

1441
01:38:18,776 --> 01:38:19,240
Scott: they you know.

1442
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:28,900
Scott: If there's a panel going on and the panel is you know opening or closing the doors are open so you can you know You walk by and a panel catches your eye at this con.

1443
01:38:29,644 --> 01:38:34,068
Scott: They kind of had to because the way everything was, you know Laid out in the building.

1444
01:38:34,349 --> 01:38:36,480
Scott: you had to keep those doors closed or else it'd be trouble.

1445
01:38:36,901 --> 01:38:40,997
Scott: But you'd walk by and you just walk down the hallway past a bunch of closed doors.

1446
01:38:41,057 --> 01:38:42,700
Scott: you had no idea There was a panel in there.

1447
01:38:42,781 --> 01:38:49,889
Scott: It wouldn't catch your eye you wouldn't hear Someone talking in a room and then be lured in by the interesting things They were saying.

1448
01:38:49,909 --> 01:38:56,620
Scott: you know And I think we probably missed out on a lot of stuff going on simply because we didn't pass by and catch it.

1449
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:59,610
Scott: We passed by a closed door with a silence behind it.

1450
01:39:00,233 --> 01:39:20,280
Rym: now in regards to saying the con was overpriced I just I wish I could look at their books or see what they spent their money on because I my best guess and this is completely out of the air out of my ass because I have to guess about Every possible thing because I have no information about how much anything cost how much money they had or anything

1451
01:39:20,541 --> 01:39:21,706
Scott: I know the thing we could have.

1452
01:39:21,987 --> 01:39:25,884
Scott: it could have been true that like the gaming room cost a billion dollars We don't know.

1453
01:39:26,448 --> 01:39:34,140
Rym: but it is my guess that ConnectiCon is not actually big enough to warrant being in that Convention Center.

1454
01:39:34,281 --> 01:39:44,520
Scott: And it is also my guess that that Convention Center being new Fancy and Union and not used a great deal is very very expensive.

1455
01:39:44,981 --> 01:40:00,605
Rym: I have a feeling that if ConnectiCon we're in a large hotel cluster as opposed to this Convention Center It would be cheaper and much better because this is one of those cons that lends itself to People getting together and hanging out all night long Which is very

1456
01:40:00,646 --> 01:40:04,299
Scott: especially with the awesome gaming room because they could keep that open all night long.

1457
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:10,900
Scott: It would be relatively good, you know average slightly above average video game room, which they could have gone all night long.

1458
01:40:11,364 --> 01:40:14,469
Rym: It would have been a fantastic Fantastic all night con.

1459
01:40:14,529 --> 01:40:19,560
Scott: I know if I could have played games all night That would have been like woohoo if I would have stayed especially if it cost less money.

1460
01:40:19,701 --> 01:40:22,180
Rym: We probably left sometimes Sunday instead of Saturday night.

1461
01:40:22,361 --> 01:40:26,960
Scott: I would have paid in all a three-day if I would have known the gaming was that good before I had gone there.

1462
01:40:27,161 --> 01:40:31,660
Rym: Yeah, but I mean, it's just I. I wonder why they're in the Convention Center.

1463
01:40:32,142 --> 01:40:34,088
Rym: I mean, is there a reason they need to be there?

1464
01:40:34,148 --> 01:40:40,272
Scott: did they know they weren't using the whole Convention Center, you know It's like they had more room than they needed.

1465
01:40:40,393 --> 01:40:46,020
Scott: and really cons They you know a lot of cons skimp and that's the thing cons need to skimp.

1466
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:48,040
Scott: You need to spend as little money as possible.

1467
01:40:48,140 --> 01:40:54,500
Scott: If you have more than you need that's a problem because you're costing all your member your members money.

1468
01:40:54,881 --> 01:40:59,839
Scott: You need to have be like right on the edge exactly what you need not more not less.

1469
01:41:00,482 --> 01:41:06,105
Rym: and I just I also wonder if the high cost has anything to do with the Budgetary problems.

1470
01:41:06,145 --> 01:41:07,792
Rym: ConnectiCon faced last year.

1471
01:41:07,812 --> 01:41:10,827
Scott: Yeah ConnectiCon you know That's the only thing I knew about.

1472
01:41:10,867 --> 01:41:13,240
Scott: ConnectiCon before going to it was it was a convention.

1473
01:41:13,762 --> 01:41:14,606
Scott: It was in Connecticut.

1474
01:41:15,048 --> 01:41:27,760
Scott: a lot of webcomic people went to it and last year They had problems because either a they didn't read the contract They signed with the Convention Center or be the Convention Center screwed them and they should have gotten a lawyer.

1475
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:29,927
Scott: So either way they screwed up.

1476
01:41:30,188 --> 01:41:33,579
Rym: Yeah, we don't know the details specifically so we can't say yes.

1477
01:41:33,860 --> 01:41:45,979
Scott: But from the internet news that I read I remember the clue conclusion We came to based on that news was either a they were dumb and they didn't read a contract or B They were dumb and they should have gotten a lawyer.

1478
01:41:46,501 --> 01:41:53,500
Rym: Yeah, because there's really I can't foresee any other situation that could have led to the thing they had to face.

1479
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:59,979
Scott: Yes, if someone knows more about that situation and would like to clarify and or correct us feel free.

1480
01:42:00,340 --> 01:42:05,200
Scott: Yes I would love to get feedback on this because that this is a great thing to talk about is is this kind of stuff?

1481
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:11,420
Rym: I would love to have enough information to one to be able to give advice Because I really think that I give good advice when it comes to conventions.

1482
01:42:11,801 --> 01:42:16,380
Scott: Yeah, I think that you know, all this con really needs is polish, you know, it's it's a good con.

1483
01:42:16,441 --> 01:42:17,739
Scott: I mean they had a great gaming room.

1484
01:42:18,182 --> 01:42:18,644
Scott: They had.

1485
01:42:18,925 --> 01:42:25,420
Scott: they had some other good stuff like the bunny bucks, which he talked about yesterday Yep, and lots of good stuff going on a lot of webcomic.

1486
01:42:25,480 --> 01:42:31,140
Scott: And if you're getting guys from California where webcomic art is to come to your con, you know, it's good stuff.

1487
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:34,371
Rym: But also bad stuff like, you know the money situation.

1488
01:42:34,391 --> 01:42:37,080
Scott: you just had to get the con to run smoother.

1489
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:48,620
Scott: You need to make it cheaper and you know, maybe change the location, you know I think if the con went somewhere else and then outgrew that somewhere else it could move back to the Convention Center.

1490
01:42:49,223 --> 01:42:52,318
Scott: You know and I'll see it's really all it needs is just some polish.

1491
01:42:52,599 --> 01:42:58,040
Rym: Yeah I just I really wonder where the money goes because they spent the money which Supposedly wasn't so much to get the full-color con book.

1492
01:42:58,100 --> 01:43:07,365
Rym: but what if instead of getting the full-color con book they could have used that money to buy better signage for something or a Bunch of fives or something.

1493
01:43:07,586 --> 01:43:09,312
Scott: Yeah, I mean they.

1494
01:43:09,372 --> 01:43:11,418
Scott: I think the guy said something like it was only 400 bucks.

1495
01:43:11,980 --> 01:43:14,048
Scott: So 400 bucks is how many $5 bills?

1496
01:43:14,409 --> 01:43:16,416
Rym: Well, 400 bucks could have done a lot of things.

1497
01:43:16,456 --> 01:43:18,523
Scott: Yeah, you know It's like.

1498
01:43:18,724 --> 01:43:21,558
Scott: they say oh, it's only 400 bucks to get full color.

1499
01:43:21,658 --> 01:43:22,563
Scott: and you know You hear that.

1500
01:43:22,624 --> 01:43:24,576
Scott: and you say well printing cost thousands of dollars.

1501
01:43:24,596 --> 01:43:25,200
Scott: That's a great deal.

1502
01:43:25,300 --> 01:43:27,569
Rym: But 400 bucks could have paid for another guest.

1503
01:43:27,931 --> 01:43:30,260
Scott: Yeah, 400 bucks could have paid for a lot of things.

1504
01:43:30,793 --> 01:43:38,363
Scott: so You just you got to wonder what this con is doing and what goes on there and what the staff and the chair and whoever What they're all up to.

1505
01:43:38,403 --> 01:43:43,960
Scott: and remember the guy who came up to us late at night and he was in charge of what?

1506
01:43:44,540 --> 01:43:47,152
Rym: Oh, he was in charge of fuck everything.

1507
01:43:47,312 --> 01:43:49,020
Rym: Yeah, everything involving webcomics.

1508
01:43:49,141 --> 01:43:50,809
Rym: He was some staffer and he seemed like a cool guy.

1509
01:43:50,970 --> 01:43:52,900
Scott: and I was like, well, do you have any staff under you?

1510
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:54,265
Scott: He's like no, it's just me.

1511
01:43:54,627 --> 01:43:57,800
Scott: and I was like, oh my god, you're running half this con all by yourself.

1512
01:43:58,223 --> 01:43:59,980
Rym: Yeah, ConnectiCon needs a lot more staff.

1513
01:44:00,040 --> 01:44:05,500
Rym: I mean it takes a lot of staff to run an anime con and they did not have enough at all.

1514
01:44:05,641 --> 01:44:08,080
Rym: In fact the ConnectiCon cost so much money.

1515
01:44:08,220 --> 01:44:20,520
Rym: but almost any problem a con faces during the convention itself can be solved by having either a More well-trained or experienced staffers or be more staffers.

1516
01:44:21,023 --> 01:44:32,510
Scott: Yeah, you can either have an army of gophers or one or two really awesome staff people with loud voices or megaphones or See both both both both.

1517
01:44:32,912 --> 01:44:36,755
Rym: Yep, like just there's a whole bunch of tiny little things I really don't want to get into because we've gone on forever.

1518
01:44:36,795 --> 01:44:37,460
Rym: It's after midnight.

1519
01:44:37,581 --> 01:44:40,399
Rym: I had a five-hour drive home and I'm very tired.

1520
01:44:41,245 --> 01:44:54,079
Rym: but a whole bunch of little things like traffic flow and walking was very difficult a lot of areas and it would have been trivial if you had enough staff to have a Sweeping that hallway making sure everyone kept moving a little things like that.

1521
01:44:54,482 --> 01:45:08,053
Rym: maybe I would have put that narrow business outside because I I'm proud that you had something cool like that at your con because many cons wouldn't even begin to think about the liability of Having a bunch of kids hitting each other with boffin weapons in convention space

1522
01:45:08,113 --> 01:45:09,398
Scott: as an official thing.

1523
01:45:09,499 --> 01:45:10,905
Scott: as you know I mean a lot of conventions.

1524
01:45:10,945 --> 01:45:13,800
Scott: just kids decide that they're gonna go outside and hit each other with sticks.

1525
01:45:14,343 --> 01:45:16,900
Scott: But this is an official like con thing.

1526
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:18,387
Scott: It's on the map of the convention.

1527
01:45:18,427 --> 01:45:21,180
Scott: Like here is the area of the convention where people hit each other with sticks.

1528
01:45:21,802 --> 01:45:25,978
Rym: I would never have sanctioned that if I were staff or security at a convention.

1529
01:45:25,998 --> 01:45:29,219
Scott: I would have put it I mean the Nero guys are having people sign waivers and stuff.

1530
01:45:29,381 --> 01:45:36,140
Scott: But I would have been like no you can come to the convention You cannot have hitting each other with sticks as an official convention event.

1531
01:45:36,622 --> 01:45:42,786
Scott: You know you could but I would have it outside unless you sign this contract accepting all liability and have it outside Which they may have.

1532
01:45:42,826 --> 01:45:50,520
Rym: but even then it just seemed like Especially since they were doing the fighting in the middle of a crowded room with just a rope on the floor around everyone.

1533
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:54,420
Scott: Yeah, but there was a kind of a. the spectators made a little wall around them.

1534
01:45:54,580 --> 01:45:55,744
Rym: so yeah, but it just.

1535
01:45:55,864 --> 01:46:05,083
Rym: it seemed like a situation that could have turned bad at any second and I Would have handled it differently, but it was definitely sketchy Definitely sketchy.

1536
01:46:05,163 --> 01:46:07,210
Rym: I I guess I'm I've been doing this for so long.

1537
01:46:07,250 --> 01:46:09,397
Rym: I really tend to edge on the side of safety.

1538
01:46:09,417 --> 01:46:10,924
Scott: Mm-hmm Definitely.

1539
01:46:10,944 --> 01:46:14,160
Rym: All right, except except when it comes to fireworks.

1540
01:46:14,801 --> 01:46:16,948
Rym: Of course, that's a completely unrelated episode.

1541
01:46:17,029 --> 01:46:19,136
Scott: Do we do have anything else to say about ConnectiCon?

1542
01:46:19,577 --> 01:46:20,300
Rym: Uh, really?

1543
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:25,826
Rym: I don't other than that unless either the price comes down or They invite us as panelists.

1544
01:46:26,428 --> 01:46:29,500
Rym: I really couldn't see myself paying to go back to ConnectiCon.

1545
01:46:29,740 --> 01:46:38,119
Scott: Yeah, unless they lower their price or they do some changes to their con or something I'm not gonna go back if I have to pay.

1546
01:46:38,662 --> 01:46:43,760
Rym: I mean all they need is a little bit of extra planning and someone who's good at being an emcee and more staff.

1547
01:46:44,262 --> 01:46:48,780
Rym: Yeah, that's really it and I have a lot of advice on how to handle all of those.

1548
01:46:48,860 --> 01:46:54,660
Rym: But if anyone wants to hear that maybe I'll do a GeekNights special or something because I'm tired and I think we're done.

1549
01:46:55,084 --> 01:46:56,053
Scott: Yeah, how long is this gun?

1550
01:46:56,093 --> 01:46:56,619
Scott: It's a long one.

1551
01:46:57,121 --> 01:47:00,877
Rym: We've gone over an hour and a half just on the bit starting with the thing of the day.

1552
01:47:00,897 --> 01:47:08,596
Rym: Cool Yeah, luckily we went short on the news and we're running out of lips in actually No, because lips and finally caught up suddenly on the archiving.

1553
01:47:08,757 --> 01:47:13,380
Rym: Hooray I think we're gonna push it now because of this super long episode that we just made great.

1554
01:47:13,862 --> 01:47:15,028
Rym: But we're we're fine.

1555
01:47:15,108 --> 01:47:15,470
Scott: Let's end it.

1556
01:47:15,510 --> 01:47:15,851
Scott: Let's end it.

1557
01:47:16,213 --> 01:47:16,957
Rym: All right, it's over.
