1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,628
Rym: It's Wednesday, December 27th.

2
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:12,693
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,853 --> 00:00:13,415
Scott: And I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:14,560
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,540
Rym: Tonight on the manga front, we preview Emma and Ode to Kirihito.

6
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:22,234
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:30,000
Rym: So we almost didn't do a show tonight because we're tired and we're planning for our New Year's bash.

8
00:00:30,761 --> 00:00:33,312
Scott: And it's much later than we usually record shows.

9
00:00:33,332 --> 00:00:36,407
Scott: I mean usually we would have been done recording about now, but we're just starting.

10
00:00:36,668 --> 00:00:37,534
Rym: See we were on track.

11
00:00:37,574 --> 00:00:38,400
Rym: We were all set to go.

12
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:51,045
Rym: I stopped at the home despot to pick up a new key for the house because a bunch of people are coming over and I figured some of them need keys in case we're not here because people are staying longer than the party as our parties tend to go.

13
00:00:51,065 --> 00:00:54,399
Scott: Some people are getting here before the party which means we have to go to work and they have to stay here.

14
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,383
Scott: They might want a key.

15
00:00:55,665 --> 00:00:58,135
Rym: And some people are staying long after the party.

16
00:00:58,717 --> 00:01:01,394
Scott: And some people really like bats in Zelda.

17
00:01:01,414 --> 00:01:01,980
Scott: They need some keys.

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,726
Rym: That was pretty sad.

19
00:01:04,747 --> 00:01:05,328
Scott: What do you want?

20
00:01:05,388 --> 00:01:06,232
Rym: I don't know that really hurt.

21
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,340
Rym: That hurt me in a profound way Scott.

22
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,957
Scott: But anyone who got, see the thing is that was a bad joke, but anyone who got it is awesome.

23
00:01:12,098 --> 00:01:12,540
Rym: That is true.

24
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,369
Rym: But in addition to that, all right, so that's good.

25
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:15,891
Rym: I come home.

26
00:01:16,373 --> 00:01:17,197
Rym: We're cooking dinner.

27
00:01:17,217 --> 00:01:17,820
Rym: We're ready to go.

28
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:28,108
Rym: Our friend Alex comes over and instead of doing all the stuff we were gonna do we end up hanging out with him and watching a bunch of Ghost in the Shell and basically dicking around for several hours.

29
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:29,052
Scott: Like two.

30
00:01:29,072 --> 00:01:34,091
Rym: In addition to me doing laundry, then finding out the key didn't work and Scott needed butter.

31
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:38,059
Rym: So we go out on the road again and now it's 1030 and we haven't even started the show.

32
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:39,082
Scott: It's 1021.

33
00:01:39,082 --> 00:01:40,828
Scott: We're starting the show right now.

34
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:41,671
Rym: It's 1027.

35
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:43,236
Scott: That's good enough.

36
00:01:43,296 --> 00:01:43,898
Scott: It's but not 1030 yet.

37
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:46,742
Scott: Yet.

38
00:01:47,184 --> 00:01:48,147
Rym: Yeah, all right.

39
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:50,295
Rym: I guess we could just bust right into the news.

40
00:01:50,315 --> 00:01:51,800
Scott: Yeah, let's bust right into this business.

41
00:01:52,480 --> 00:02:10,737
Scott: Alright, so I'm reading this article here that was on the Anime News Network where all anime news comes from and it's from Business Standard, which I guess is some big-time newspaper in India and the article says "Indian bookstores are stacking up with graphic novels in the Japanese

42
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,159
Scott: genre.".

43
00:02:11,681 --> 00:02:16,600
Scott: And I said, "Oh, you know, we always keep thinking about Japan and the U.S.

44
00:02:17,202 --> 00:02:23,206
Scott: and we don't think, you know, we keep seeing all this Japanese culture coming over to the U.S You know, the sushi already came over.

45
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,534
Scott: You know, the anime has pretty much come over.

46
00:02:25,714 --> 00:02:27,400
Scott: The manga is coming over pretty strong.

47
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:35,240
Scott: They're just selling us all their culture, but we don't really think that Japan or anyone else so much exporting the culture elsewhere.

48
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:41,220
Scott: I mean, you don't read articles about manga in South Africa or popularity of manga in Russia.

49
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,886
Scott: So this really kind of opened my eyes to, "Hey, manga is popular in India.

50
00:02:47,147 --> 00:02:48,031
Scott: That makes sense.

51
00:02:48,554 --> 00:02:49,960
Scott: I should have realized that before.

52
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,308
Scott: I wonder where else manga is popular besides U.S.

53
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,655
Scott: and India and maybe Britain and

54
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,057
Scott: Canada.".

55
00:02:56,237 --> 00:02:57,160
Rym: I'd imagine France.

56
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,423
Scott: I imagine Mexico.

57
00:02:58,443 --> 00:03:02,518
Scott: Cause anime's always been- There's probably some big-time manga going down in Mexico and South America.

58
00:03:02,538 --> 00:03:02,679
Scott: Yeah.

59
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,639
Scott: Possibly the France.

60
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:05,702
Rym: You know what?

61
00:03:05,863 --> 00:03:14,126
Rym: I hate to say it, but I get a feeling that what a lot of what you'd find in Mexico would be- Remember all those Chinese comics we found at the shore?

62
00:03:14,146 --> 00:03:19,523
Scott: I don't know, because Dragon Ball was real big in the Spanish-speaking You know what?

63
00:03:19,845 --> 00:03:23,540
Rym: Dragon Ball is honestly a lot like those Chinese comics.

64
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:31,000
Scott: I'm just saying, I remember Dragon Ball was always on the Spanish, you know, channel on the cable network where I lived and it was really popular.

65
00:03:31,662 --> 00:03:36,060
Scott: And I always, like Hispanic kids that I knew, were always Dragon Ballers.

66
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:42,870
Rym: Well, I remember Anime World Orders always talking, because they were asking a while ago about, you know, people in different countries and how they watch anime.

67
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,846
Rym: And they've gotten a bunch of responses that I don't remember, so I can't say anything about them.

68
00:03:47,027 --> 00:04:00,383
Scott: The other interesting thing about this article is after they talk about how, you know, manga is so popular in India and it's getting bigger and stuff, they list some manga that you should buy and their recommendations are excellent.

69
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:02,490
Scott: The first recommendation is Akira.

70
00:04:02,631 --> 00:04:03,032
Rym: Of course.

71
00:04:03,093 --> 00:04:03,936
Scott: Followed by Buddha.

72
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:04,457
Rym: Of course.

73
00:04:04,518 --> 00:04:05,200
Rym: Crying Freeman.

74
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:05,500
Scott: Yep.

75
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:06,644
Scott: Lone Wolf and Cub.

76
00:04:07,045 --> 00:04:10,796
Scott: And then Othello, which I think I've seen in the stores and never run, never read.

77
00:04:11,257 --> 00:04:17,702
Scott: It's some j-rock teen manga, but the first four were all hardcore, real-deal mangas.

78
00:04:18,123 --> 00:04:28,120
Scott: And I think it's pretty cool that, you know, over here, it's the schoolgirl crap that's popular, but apparently over there in the big-time newspaper in India, they're pushing the good stuff.

79
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,640
Scott: Well, I think part of the reason the- Kazuo Koikei's and the Tezuka's and the Otomo's.

80
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,095
Rym: You know, whenever I hear Koikei's name, I can't help but laugh.

81
00:04:36,115 --> 00:04:37,100
Rym: It has nothing to do with his name.

82
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,989
Scott: Have you ever seen a picture of Kazuo Koikei?

83
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:39,672
Rym: No, I haven't.

84
00:04:39,692 --> 00:04:41,260
Scott: You should go look because you'd laugh two times.

85
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:43,200
Rym: I don't need that in my life.

86
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,222
Rym: Yeah, you do.

87
00:04:44,362 --> 00:04:52,838
Rym: I laugh enough at the content of all that he has done and the vibe I get from that classic, magical name.

88
00:04:54,063 --> 00:04:54,578
Rym: That man.

89
00:04:56,401 --> 00:04:57,707
Rym: It's kind of like with Robin Williams.

90
00:04:58,128 --> 00:05:06,674
Rym: No matter what he does, no matter what role he's playing, no matter what the situation is, it could be a World War II movie and genocide everything.

91
00:05:07,276 --> 00:05:12,180
Rym: If I see Robin Williams, I can't help but laugh or at least suppress a laugh.

92
00:05:13,761 --> 00:05:14,483
Rym: I don't know why.

93
00:05:14,503 --> 00:05:20,280
Rym: I just can't help but laugh when I see him, and I can't help but laugh when I hear about Koikei.

94
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,180
Scott: That's him on the left, on the right.

95
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:26,996
Rym: You know, in a sick way, he looks exactly the way a man like that should.

96
00:05:27,016 --> 00:05:28,060
Scott: I like the beard.

97
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,949
Scott: The beard really puts the whole thing together.

98
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:38,860
Scott: Especially with the glasses, he reminds me of someone- He's sort of like got like this Buddha-shaped head with this like a sort of American-style like gray old man hair.

99
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,856
Rym: These little tiny circle glasses, his big nose- You know what he kind of reminds me of?

100
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:44,940
Rym: Ichijima.

101
00:05:46,402 --> 00:05:46,985
Rym: Eh, kinda.

102
00:05:47,005 --> 00:05:49,154
Rym: A little bit, like maybe a younger Ichijima.

103
00:05:49,174 --> 00:05:50,097
Rym: Maybe, maybe.

104
00:05:51,286 --> 00:05:51,560
Rym: Anyway.

105
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,259
Scott: Oh, what's your news?

106
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,763
Scott: Oh, that guy on the left?

107
00:05:58,944 --> 00:05:59,706
Scott: That's Carl Horn.

108
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:01,652
Rym: That's what Carl Horn looks like?

109
00:06:01,872 --> 00:06:02,494
Scott: Apparently.

110
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:04,460
Rym: He doesn't look nearly as cool as Kazuo Koikei.

111
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,926
Scott: No, he doesn't look cool at all.

112
00:06:05,946 --> 00:06:09,080
Rym: Granted, I think not many human beings look cooler than Kazuo Koikei.

113
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,808
Scott: I think a lot of people look cooler than Kazuo Koikei.

114
00:06:11,828 --> 00:06:13,273
Scott: He doesn't look very cool, but- I don't know.

115
00:06:13,293 --> 00:06:15,340
Scott: He definitely looks like Kazuo Koikei does.

116
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,287
Rym: Alright, so this is- I'll link this to anime, alright?

117
00:06:21,888 --> 00:06:28,280
Rym: This is something that, if it is followed all the way through, will allow more anime to be shown in America uncensored.

118
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,124
Scott: What?

119
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:29,599
Scott: Okay.

120
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:35,509
Rym: So the FCC is one of my most hated government entities in the United States.

121
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:41,240
Rym: You see, they're responsible for pretty much anything that has to do with communications in the United States.

122
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:56,017
Scott: Well, their original purpose was Congress said, "Hey, you know, this sucks that we have all these radio things, and they keep changing, and it sucks to have more than one person use the same frequency, so we need to find a way to dole out the frequencies, and we can't be bothered to do it ourselves.

123
00:06:56,037 --> 00:06:58,079
Scott: Let's make a federal agency to just take care of

124
00:06:58,139 --> 00:06:58,199
Scott: it.".

125
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:58,860
Scott: And they did.

126
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,123
Rym: Now, regulating that sort of thing is okay.

127
00:07:01,183 --> 00:07:10,360
Rym: I mean, you'd have to be quite a libertarian wackjob to argue against the idea that the airwaves should be at least moderated in some degree.

128
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:13,000
Scott: Yeah, or otherwise they just become useless.

129
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,710
Rym: It would just be absolute chaos.

130
00:07:14,992 --> 00:07:19,820
Scott: I mean, already on the borders of America- That's like saying there shouldn't be any traffic laws at all, just roads.

131
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:35,680
Rym: I mean, already on the borders of America, particularly the southern border, there are radio stations in Mexico broadcasting at unbelievably powerful, powerful rates into the United States, because there's nothing we can do about it.

132
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,309
Scott: Yep.

133
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:39,646
Rym: And in fact, you're usually broadcasting American content.

134
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:46,900
Rym: I learned that recently, and I found it hilarious from someone I know who's living down there.

135
00:07:47,120 --> 00:08:01,560
Rym: But the FCC has grown to basically, in addition to regulating the airwaves, violating the First Amendment on a regular basis by censoring pretty much anything that is broadcast on any medium over which they have control.

136
00:08:02,401 --> 00:08:08,308
Rym: Now, the way they get around this is that they're not technically censoring because there is no prior restraint.

137
00:08:08,548 --> 00:08:18,319
Rym: They will never go to someone and say, "You can't say X on your radio show," or "You have to show us this crazy thing and then we'll say if it's okay or

138
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:18,520
Rym: not.".

139
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,906
Rym: In fact, they won't even say what's okay or not.

140
00:08:21,147 --> 00:08:25,620
Rym: There's actually no official public list of what's okay and what's not okay.

141
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,839
Scott: Because if there was a public list, that would be blatantly against the First Amendment.

142
00:08:29,859 --> 00:08:30,180
Scott: censorship.

143
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:30,573
Scott: Yeah.

144
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,259
Scott: And they can't do it.

145
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,128
Rym: So they can't have the prior restraint or anything, and they can't have any sort of prior review either.

146
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:38,852
Rym: So what they do is they just wait.

147
00:08:39,374 --> 00:08:43,039
Rym: And if Howard Stern accidentally says something that sounds like fuck...

148
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,375
Scott: Well, he's not on the radio anymore, but...

149
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:50,760
Rym: Remember, pretty much the only reason he actually left radio was because the FCC wouldn't leave him alone.

150
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,110
Scott: Yeah.

151
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,000
Rym: But I'll get to all that, because it's... I could do a whole show on this business.

152
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,354
Scott: We could.

153
00:08:56,922 --> 00:08:57,619
Rym: We probably should.

154
00:08:58,043 --> 00:08:58,400
Scott: Eventually.

155
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,300
Rym: Maybe, someday.

156
00:09:01,163 --> 00:09:04,420
Rym: So say he says fuck by accident, or someone calls in and says...

157
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,339
Scott: Oh, he can say fuck!

158
00:09:06,161 --> 00:09:06,723
Rym: Ain't it great?

159
00:09:07,685 --> 00:09:09,029
Rym: Fuck, fuck, fuckity fuck.

160
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,697
Rym: Okay, I got it out.

161
00:09:11,737 --> 00:09:12,620
Rym: I got them all out today.

162
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:13,359
Scott: Alright, bitches.

163
00:09:14,681 --> 00:09:18,049
Rym: So someone calls in and says it on the show, or something happens.

164
00:09:18,731 --> 00:09:21,899
Rym: And the FCC can just come back and be like, "Yeah, that's a million dollar

165
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,200
Rym: fine.".

166
00:09:23,261 --> 00:09:25,069
Rym: But he didn't violate any public rule.

167
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:27,640
Rym: There was no official thing he wasn't allowed to do.

168
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:31,860
Rym: They just decided, arbitrarily, after the fact, to fine him.

169
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:43,060
Rym: And in fact, in many cases, they would make an arbitrary rule and wait a week until a radio show such as Howard Stern had violated that rule five, six, seven times, and hadn't been warned.

170
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:48,936
Rym: And then suddenly they say, "Oh, by the way, million dollars per instance, and oh, you did it seven times this week.

171
00:09:49,498 --> 00:09:49,999
Rym: How about

172
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:50,240
Rym: that?".

173
00:09:51,682 --> 00:09:55,060
Rym: And the worst part is that the FCC doesn't actually do any of this on their own.

174
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,280
Rym: There is a very, very small number of right-wing Christian groups.

175
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,740
Rym: And I forget, there's basically three groups, and you can find their names easily on the internet.

176
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,420
Scott: There's like Parents something...

177
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,360
Rym: The Parents Television Console, something like that.

178
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,639
Scott: I don't know, there's a whole bunch of them.

179
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,440
Rym: But there's like two or three big ones.

180
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:18,980
Rym: And what they do is anytime, they watch TV, and when they find anything that they find offensive.

181
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,960
Rym: You know, basically anything funny, interesting.

182
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,139
Scott: So basically one person is watching television.

183
00:10:23,345 --> 00:10:23,518
Scott: Yeah.

184
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:31,640
Scott: And then when they see something that they don't like, they tell all the other people who are just going about their daily lives that that show had something bad.

185
00:10:32,002 --> 00:10:35,000
Scott: And then all those people write letters to the FCC complaining.

186
00:10:35,282 --> 00:10:35,719
Scott: Most of them?

187
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,660
Scott: The FCC gets a thousand letters.

188
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,271
Rym: Most of them now are internet form letters.

189
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:39,500
Rym: They're not even real letters.

190
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:45,096
Scott: And they're all from the same, you know, it looks like, "Oh shit, we got a thousand letters about this show.

191
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:46,260
Scott: We should go do something about

192
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:46,320
Scott: it.".

193
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,760
Scott: But really, it's from one group sending all those letters.

194
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,499
Rym: Now not only that, that's horseshit right there.

195
00:10:53,980 --> 00:11:02,600
Rym: But they're unpublished, they're effectively censoring by just fucking you after the fact if you say the word "fuck" and taking away all your money and doing all these evil things.

196
00:11:03,222 --> 00:11:04,598
Rym: And they're totally getting away with it.

197
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:17,880
Rym: Until now, the networks are starting to not take this anymore, especially with the fact that Sirius Radio and XM Radio, which aren't bound by FCC rules, are basically destroying terrestrial radio.

198
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,099
Scott: And podcasting.

199
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,440
Rym: Yes, podcasting too is destroying radio, so you're a part of this.

200
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,642
Scott: I mean, think about it.

201
00:11:24,324 --> 00:11:30,479
Scott: You go out there, you know, and if you ask people on the street, most of them will say, "Yeah, kids shouldn't be listening to

202
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:30,660
Scott: that.".

203
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:45,300
Scott: But if you actually look at the listening and viewing habits of entertainment of most people in this country, violent, sexy, swearing stuff is what people want to see, it's what they pay to see, it's what more people go to see, it makes the big money.

204
00:11:46,144 --> 00:11:46,897
Scott: That's where it's at.

205
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:53,700
Scott: The number of people who are actually, you know, against that stuff is a minority, not the majority.

206
00:11:54,322 --> 00:12:01,560
Rym: And yet the FCC will find someone a million dollars based on the complaints of a thousand people, only one of whom probably actually saw the offending item.

207
00:12:03,501 --> 00:12:12,578
Rym: To cut a long story short, people have been taking the FCC to court, and it's starting to look like, in Gandalf's words, "We're at the turn of the

208
00:12:12,618 --> 00:12:12,898
Rym: tide.".

209
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:29,940
Rym: Judges have basically been practically flat out yelling at the FCC and calling them out on all the things I just said, and how they're effectively using a loophole and pedantic arguments to get around the First Amendment and censor people to their heart's content.

210
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,339
Scott: Yeah, that's what they're doing.

211
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:43,400
Rym: And if these judges are backed up by other judges, and if this gets to high courts, it may be that the FCC will lose its power of enforcing obscenity, decency, and blasphemy laws.

212
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,705
Scott: That's bad news for us.

213
00:12:44,725 --> 00:12:47,536
Scott: People start listening to us through radio again.

214
00:12:47,556 --> 00:12:48,500
Scott: Oh, shits.

215
00:12:49,421 --> 00:12:50,287
Rym: What's in the news, Rob?

216
00:12:50,307 --> 00:12:50,630
Scott: Oh, Howard!

217
00:12:54,144 --> 00:12:55,714
Rym: I don't find Howard Stern funny at all.

218
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:56,540
Rym: I'll say that straight up.

219
00:12:57,221 --> 00:12:58,083
Scott: I know.

220
00:12:58,925 --> 00:13:04,300
Scott: His TV show is okay because then you can see on the occasion when he does something crazy in the studio.

221
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,816
Scott: Better than that is just a guy going, "Hey, I have a great radio voice.

222
00:13:07,837 --> 00:13:07,997
Scott: What's

223
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:08,239
Scott: up?".

224
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,026
Rym: You know how he has the great radio voice?

225
00:13:10,226 --> 00:13:13,960
Rym: He basically sticks the microphone in his mouth, down his throat, and into his lungs.

226
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,740
Scott: He also has been a radio guy forever, and he trained to be that radio guy.

227
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,146
Rym: But I think his show is pretty crap and pretty not funny.

228
00:13:21,206 --> 00:13:29,960
Rym: However, that man is one of the few people who is in a position to fight for the First Amendment and is fighting for the First Amendment at every opportunity.

229
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,920
Rym: Things of the day!

230
00:13:39,064 --> 00:13:39,700
Scott: You wanna go first?

231
00:13:40,301 --> 00:13:41,226
Rym: Alright, I can go first.

232
00:13:41,246 --> 00:13:43,720
Rym: 'Cause mine is not in any way anime-related.

233
00:13:44,048 --> 00:13:44,232
Scott: Okay.

234
00:13:45,185 --> 00:13:48,857
Scott: I guess you could consider-- Mine is kind of Japanese, sorta.

235
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,840
Rym: Well, it has a relevant anime-related anecdote.

236
00:13:52,681 --> 00:13:53,018
Scott: I guess.

237
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,820
Rym: I mean, it almost changed the course of our lives.

238
00:13:57,524 --> 00:13:57,959
Scott: No, it didn't.

239
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,618
Rym: Yeah, it did.

240
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,298
Scott: Alright, well, I don't know what you're talking about, so.

241
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,380
Rym: Alright, alright, so we're fans of Penn and Teller, the musical act, and we're-- The musical act, really?

242
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,720
Rym: The kind of musical.

243
00:14:09,104 --> 00:14:09,376
Scott: I don't know.

244
00:14:09,702 --> 00:14:10,668
Rym: Magical act!

245
00:14:11,192 --> 00:14:12,319
Rym: The magic act.

246
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:16,680
Rym: And, you know, Penn Jillette, the dude, and Teller, the dude, 'cause they do that show.

247
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:22,060
Rym: Bulls hit, or as we can say without the FCC breathing down our necks, bullshit.

248
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,140
Rym: Well, one of the things they do is that they do pretty awesome magic.

249
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,620
Scott: And unlike other magicians, they're not afraid to-- Unlike other magicians, they do their show every night.

250
00:14:32,501 --> 00:14:37,440
Rym: They're not afraid to reveal to the world exactly how they do their tricks.

251
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:47,340
Scott: Well, some of the tricks they don't tell just because they want to keep the act-- They want to keep you coming to the show, 'cause if you know how they do everything, the show is not interesting anymore.

252
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,368
Rym: Well, yeah, but in general, they very much play the angle of, "We're doing tricks.

253
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:52,377
Rym: See if you can figure it

254
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:52,640
Rym: out.".

255
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,533
Rym: Or, "Yeah, we did a crazy trick.

256
00:14:54,553 --> 00:14:55,520
Rym: There's no magic here.

257
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,398
Rym: It's just a lot of work and effort and cool sleight of

258
00:14:58,418 --> 00:14:58,700
Rym: hand.".

259
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,456
Scott: Yeah, like, "Hey, check out this cool trick I can

260
00:15:00,496 --> 00:15:00,577
Scott: do.".

261
00:15:01,745 --> 00:15:02,972
Scott: "Ah, isn't that entertaining?

262
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:04,340
Scott: Good, you paid me for that entertainment.

263
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,431
Scott: That's right, now I'm rich.

264
00:15:05,512 --> 00:15:05,613
Scott: Ha

265
00:15:05,694 --> 00:15:05,977
Scott: ha.".

266
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:14,799
Rym: But a lot of times-- I mean, they've revealed many times exactly how tricks are done to the world, and a lot of other magicians have seemed to have gotten kind of mad about this.

267
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,620
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, there are the tricks that you can learn by going to any magic store, and there's just the book that tells you how to do it.

268
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,760
Scott: They usually reveal the tricks that are just, like, one step above that.

269
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:29,880
Scott: They never reveal, like, the big time stuff that, you know, the big time tricks that only super professional magicians know how to do.

270
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,138
Rym: Well, pretty much the ones that only they do.

271
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:31,919
Scott: Exactly.

272
00:15:32,301 --> 00:15:34,196
Rym: But they'll reveal someone else's trick.

273
00:15:34,216 --> 00:15:34,619
Rym: They don't care.

274
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,574
Scott: I guess.

275
00:15:35,655 --> 00:15:35,960
Scott: Whatever.

276
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:46,879
Rym: Yeah, but, I mean, one of the things is they point out that a good trick is one that is just as impressive if you know exactly how they do it, because then it's not a matter of, "Wow, how'd they do

277
00:15:46,939 --> 00:15:47,080
Rym: that?".

278
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:49,235
Rym: It's a matter of, "Holy shit, they did

279
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:49,577
Rym: that?".

280
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:50,463
Scott: Yeah.

281
00:15:50,644 --> 00:15:54,633
Scott: It's also, you know, you look at the guy doing it, and you're like, "Whoa, that takes a lot of effort.

282
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:55,016
Scott: I couldn't do

283
00:15:55,057 --> 00:15:55,178
Scott: that.".

284
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,420
Rym: Yep, because they'll talk about how, like, a trick that takes ten seconds on stage takes fourteen hours of preparation.

285
00:16:00,847 --> 00:16:01,017
Scott: Yep.

286
00:16:01,462 --> 00:16:04,700
Rym: But this is a video from some show, and it doesn't matter.

287
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,580
Rym: Just forget all, doesn't matter the context or anything.

288
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,294
Scott: Yeah, don't worry why Regis Philbin's there.

289
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:09,840
Scott: Just ignore him.

290
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:15,459
Rym: They show you a trick, and then they do the trick again where everything's transparent so you can see exactly how they did it.

291
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:24,299
Rym: Granted, it wasn't the biggest trick, and if you have any amount of brain, you'll figure out exactly how they did the trick well before they show you how they did the trick.

292
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:32,820
Scott: It's funny because they have this music that plays when they do the trick, and then the lyrics to the song change when they show you the trick revealed, and it's pretty hilarious.

293
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,679
Rym: If by hilarious you mean so lame it hurts.

294
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,420
Scott: In other words, hilarious.

295
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,220
Scott: It's so lame that it's actually funny.

296
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,260
Rym: Right, so get to your semi-anime-related thing of the day.

297
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,480
Scott: Okay, I'm bringing it back with a thing of the day classic.

298
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,057
Scott: We need a thing of the day classic here.

299
00:16:49,704 --> 00:16:50,360
Scott: Lightning, lightning.

300
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,384
Scott: This thing of the day is from, God, 2000?

301
00:16:54,384 --> 00:16:56,020
Rym: We were freshmen in college.

302
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,840
Scott: It had to be the year 2000.

303
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,619
Scott: We're not exactly sure what it is.

304
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:03,540
Scott: We're pretty sure it's a trailer, not a trailer.

305
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,660
Rym: A trailer for an epic movie.

306
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:16,859
Scott: It's a pilot for a Japanese sitcom or comedy sketch show that never got turned into a real show, but it's in English.

307
00:17:17,742 --> 00:17:21,378
Scott: All the actors speak in English, and there's some Japanese subtitles going on.

308
00:17:22,143 --> 00:17:25,380
Scott: And yeah, October 20th, the year 2000.

309
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,119
Scott: Pilot Tokyo Breakfast.

310
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:30,920
Scott: Now you might already know what this is because it's been around for seven years.

311
00:17:31,781 --> 00:17:33,499
Scott: But you might not know what it is.

312
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,215
Scott: Let me tell you.

313
00:17:34,741 --> 00:17:42,000
Scott: It is a six-minute long comedy sketch involving a Tokyo family with a mom, a dad, a grandpa, a son, and a daughter.

314
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:46,140
Scott: And it is so racist, good God.

315
00:17:47,104 --> 00:17:48,060
Rym: You think you know racism?

316
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,160
Scott: You think you know racism?

317
00:17:49,881 --> 00:17:54,040
Scott: I am a fan of the type of comedy done by people such as Richard Pryor.

318
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,644
Scott: You know, "Black man do this.

319
00:17:56,186 --> 00:17:57,390
Scott: White man does that.

320
00:17:57,992 --> 00:17:59,035
Scott: Black man do this.

321
00:17:59,576 --> 00:18:00,479
Scott: White man does

322
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:00,720
Scott: that.".

323
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,160
Scott: And that's a little bit racist, but it's not insulting racist.

324
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,380
Scott: It's like, yeah, that's a racial stereotype, and it is funny to think about it.

325
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,820
Scott: This is so racist.

326
00:18:12,102 --> 00:18:17,700
Scott: I guess it's not KKK racist, but it's more racist than people are in their everyday lives.

327
00:18:17,801 --> 00:18:20,055
Scott: It crosses the line to where you go, "Whoa,

328
00:18:20,096 --> 00:18:20,418
Scott: dude.".

329
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:27,214
Scott: If someone acted like this, like hanging out with you, you'd be like, "Oh, dude, you can't be doing that.

330
00:18:27,254 --> 00:18:27,597
Scott: That's not

331
00:18:27,637 --> 00:18:27,879
Scott: cool.".

332
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,482
Rym: Yeah.

333
00:18:29,004 --> 00:18:33,793
Rym: Now granted, we saw this RIT and for a while we all sat around and we're like, "Is this funny or

334
00:18:33,834 --> 00:18:34,138
Rym: wrong?".

335
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,815
Rym: And we laughed at half of it and half of it, and we're just like,

336
00:18:36,835 --> 00:18:36,936
Rym: "Wow.".

337
00:18:38,481 --> 00:18:46,040
Scott: It doesn't matter because nowadays it's all hilarious because I've seen it so many times, the racism effect doesn't work on me anymore.

338
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,417
Rym: You gotta reveal what it is at all or should we just let people see it?

339
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:56,958
Scott: It's Japanese people speaking English, being racist, and funny.

340
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:58,602
Rym: Yeah.

341
00:18:58,865 --> 00:19:00,380
Rym: Well, I'll just put it this way.

342
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,620
Rym: The way that this almost changed our lives is that we were freshmen and we all watched it, and then the next day we all went to anime club.

343
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:17,000
Rym: And after anime club, we're standing in tape checkout, and one of us yells out to our group in the corner one of the taglines from this little sketch comedy.

344
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,997
Rym: And then the rest of us shout back, "We

345
00:19:21,057 --> 00:19:21,580
Rym: did!".

346
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:29,758
Rym: And we do a little bit from it and we're all laughing, and the administration of the club comes down, and they almost kicked us out of club right there.

347
00:19:31,881 --> 00:19:34,740
Rym: Granted, it wasn't the first time they'd tried to kick us out of club.

348
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,980
Scott: You failed everything except animation.

349
00:19:40,088 --> 00:19:40,400
Scott: Okay.

350
00:19:42,162 --> 00:19:48,280
Rym: If you are offended by racism to an extreme level, I highly recommend you do not watch this.

351
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:57,980
Scott: Yeah, if you are the kind of person who watches white men do this, black men do that comedy, and you do not find it funny, and you're all insulted, you're going to be super insulted at this.

352
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,266
Rym: But granted, this isn't that bad.

353
00:19:59,307 --> 00:20:01,620
Rym: It's not like, I don't know, ku klux ken evil.

354
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,700
Scott: It's not ku klux ken evil, no.

355
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,487
Rym: It's not that bad.

356
00:20:05,588 --> 00:20:08,360
Rym: It's just not that good either.

357
00:20:08,743 --> 00:20:10,199
Rym: But it is kind of funny.

358
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:11,566
Scott: It's really funny.

359
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:13,335
Scott: Especially at the end.

360
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,260
Scott: The end is hilarious.

361
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,468
Scott: Like the joke, it's a running gag.

362
00:20:16,528 --> 00:20:19,240
Scott: The same racist joke pervades the whole six minutes.

363
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:29,540
Scott: But there's a couple of other jokes that come up in the middle of it, and then at the end, there's a super payoff, even if the joke gets wearing thin in the middle.

364
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:36,409
Rym: Like it wears thin to the most it could wear thin, and then, I don't know, they must have just found this guy on the street and been like, "You American, come

365
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:36,631
Rym: here.".

366
00:20:38,184 --> 00:20:40,157
Scott: We need a gaijin for our pilot.

367
00:20:40,278 --> 00:20:40,539
Scott: Get here.

368
00:20:42,122 --> 00:20:43,895
Rym: I imagine they just gave this guy like 10,000 yen.

369
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,534
Rym: They're like, "Say this line and carry this

370
00:20:46,595 --> 00:20:46,897
Rym: box.".

371
00:20:48,001 --> 00:20:48,664
Scott: Alright, that's enough.

372
00:20:49,046 --> 00:20:52,799
Scott: This is a classic thing of the day that we hold dear, and you should all see it.

373
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,040
Rym: Yeah, it's a tiny piece of front row crew history.

374
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,908
Rym: You see, that was from before.

375
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,540
Rym: funny internet videos were easy to come by.

376
00:20:59,981 --> 00:21:00,871
Scott: It was, it was.

377
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:01,600
Scott: You are correct.

378
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:11,460
Rym: I mean, you could go to College Humor, which had like- I think the only things competing with this were all your base and- Uh, maybe Hyaku Goju-Ichi, but I think that was actually later.

379
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,794
Scott: Yeah, I think that was later.

380
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:13,240
Scott: I'm not sure.

381
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,418
Scott: I had to go look at the dates.

382
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,099
Rym: Yeah, this is, I mean, there was no YouTube back then.

383
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:26,780
Rym: If you found something funny on the internet, you could guarantee that everyone you knew would see the exact same video and you would laugh about it hysterically because it was the only entertainment you had.

384
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:31,340
Scott: Yeah, and finding out about it was even more difficult because there weren't even blogs back then.

385
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,938
Scott: I mean, Slashdot was the only thing you had.

386
00:21:33,482 --> 00:21:36,179
Rym: God, I started reading Slashdot when I got to RIT.

387
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:41,799
Scott: I read Slashdot like a few months before I got to RIT, but I started really reading it when I got to RIT.

388
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,459
Rym: Right, so we were gonna do the show on Initial D.

389
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,239
Scott: Which is gonna be a great show.

390
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:53,340
Rym: However, since it's late and we're tired, we were not prepared to put forth the requisite effort to do Initial D justice.

391
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,600
Scott: Initial D requires great justice.

392
00:21:56,542 --> 00:22:13,238
Scott: You may or may not like our take on Initial D, but suffice to say- I have a feeling it is an area of contention with the other anime podcasts and most anime fans out there with our stance on Initial D.

393
00:22:13,702 --> 00:22:19,837
Rym: I have a feeling that we're going to win that battle, not in the first place or the second place, but in the third place.

394
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:25,035
Scott: Not in the straightaways or the corners, but in the third place.

395
00:22:26,205 --> 00:22:27,580
Scott: But we're not talking about that today.

396
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,058
Scott: No, we're not talking about Initial D. We're gonna do a two for two.

397
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,860
Rym: Kinda like the old format of the show before we switched it up a bit.

398
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,907
Rym: So this is kind of a throwback to the way GeekNights was, I don't know, 220 episodes ago.

399
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:45,379
Scott: Yeah, Rym's gonna do one manga, and I'm gonna do one manga, and then we're gonna go to fucking bed.

400
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,220
Rym: Yeah, we're not really reviewing, so don't worry about that.

401
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,531
Rym: No spoilers or anything.

402
00:22:49,551 --> 00:22:54,213
Rym: This is more of a preview, meaning we're gonna basically let you know- Like, "Hey, I read this manga.

403
00:22:54,234 --> 00:22:54,477
Scott: Check it

404
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:54,659
Scott: out.".

405
00:22:54,801 --> 00:22:58,558
Rym: -if this is the kind of thing you would like and if it was the kind of thing that we'd like.

406
00:22:59,180 --> 00:22:59,415
Rym: Mm-hmm.

407
00:22:59,801 --> 00:23:02,880
Rym: And Scott's is very highbrow, I guess.

408
00:23:03,101 --> 00:23:04,059
Scott: And yours is mediumbrow.

409
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,479
Rym: Yeah, definitely not lowbrow.

410
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:06,660
Scott: No, it's not lowbrow.

411
00:23:06,848 --> 00:23:06,892
Scott: No.

412
00:23:07,404 --> 00:23:09,080
Rym: All right, you wanna go first?

413
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:09,683
Scott: I don't know.

414
00:23:09,704 --> 00:23:10,533
Scott: Mine's bigger than yours.

415
00:23:10,614 --> 00:23:11,140
Scott: I should go second.

416
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:16,220
Rym: All right, mine's really little, so... That'll be taken out of context.

417
00:23:16,924 --> 00:23:17,498
Scott: Oh, yeah.

418
00:23:17,721 --> 00:23:26,700
Rym: Right, so for Christmas, in addition to another amazing gift, Emily got me a copy of Emma, which is a manga by Kaoru Mori, who is a woman.

419
00:23:27,721 --> 00:23:30,899
Rym: A lot of people think that the manga artist here is a man.

420
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:33,793
Rym: Numerous people have stated as such, and that's not true.

421
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:34,120
Rym: It's a woman.

422
00:23:34,742 --> 00:23:48,800
Scott: See, I knew about this because I watched part of the first episode of the fan sub of the anime, and then I found out it was a manga, and all I knew about it was that it was a manga about maids, but it was not a perverted manga about maids.

423
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,659
Scott: It was seriously about maids.

424
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,820
Rym: Yeah, like, you know most crap anime, like, a character's dressed as a maid.

425
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,359
Rym: Paromatic.

426
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,099
Rym: Only they're all, like, pink or something, and then they have sex with each other, or something horrible.

427
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:00,758
Scott: Every hentai.

428
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:07,300
Rym: Emma is set, and this is how Emily actually sold it to me, by telling me about this way, way even before.

429
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:14,718
Rym: It's a show about maids that's set in Victorian England, and is actually about realistically portrayed maids.

430
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:15,227
Scott: Yeah.

431
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,120
Rym: Like, it's a straight up drama, romantic comedy.

432
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,940
Rym: None of that, no perversion, none of that stupid crap.

433
00:24:23,142 --> 00:24:25,120
Scott: No revealing cleavage, no up skirts.

434
00:24:25,582 --> 00:24:28,740
Rym: It's a period piece that is generally very faithful to the period.

435
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:37,480
Rym: I mean, as faithful as something like this can be, and apparently the mangaka is actually, I guess I would describe her as an anglophile.

436
00:24:38,684 --> 00:24:40,220
Rym: That might be an understatement.

437
00:24:40,701 --> 00:24:47,879
Rym: She really freaking likes England, and English history, and this era, and she is super super super into this, according to everything I read about her.

438
00:24:48,502 --> 00:24:54,575
Rym: And according to the things she writes about herself, in the little, uh, hello, welcome to my manga bit at the end of this.

439
00:24:55,161 --> 00:25:03,060
Scott: Yeah, I noticed that in a lot of manga, uh, like at the end of every volume, there'd be like a couple, you know, like a few pages of just silly manga.

440
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:03,907
Scott: Like, hee hee hee.

441
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,297
Scott: Like Fullmetal Alchemist has it, Trigon has it.

442
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:06,439
Scott: Yep.

443
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,699
Scott: You know, uh, I wonder what's up with that.

444
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,351
Scott: Like, you don't see that.

445
00:25:10,472 --> 00:25:12,272
Scott: It's not a convention from American comics.

446
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:12,980
Rym: And you know what?

447
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:13,746
Rym: I really like it.

448
00:25:13,968 --> 00:25:16,531
Scott: I do like it, but I'm just saying I wonder where that came from.

449
00:25:16,571 --> 00:25:17,480
Scott: I'd like to learn more about it.

450
00:25:17,722 --> 00:25:24,840
Rym: I will say this, the after manga, or the afterword manga in Emma, is absolutely hilarious.

451
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,603
Rym: Kinda like the, uh, uh, Cromartie after manga.

452
00:25:27,663 --> 00:25:28,026
Rym: I don't know.

453
00:25:28,046 --> 00:25:30,370
Scott: It's tough to compete with the Fullmetal Alchemist after manga.

454
00:25:30,512 --> 00:25:30,939
Rym: I don't know.

455
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,172
Scott: Is that what we're gonna call it?

456
00:25:32,192 --> 00:25:32,780
Scott: The after manga?

457
00:25:33,101 --> 00:25:34,534
Scott: Someone tell us the correct word.

458
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:35,120
Scott: I feel bad.

459
00:25:35,381 --> 00:25:38,431
Rym: Well, it's called afterword manga in Emma.

460
00:25:38,795 --> 00:25:39,299
Scott: Okay, that's fun.

461
00:25:39,921 --> 00:25:43,100
Rym: It's also called Gentleman's Fancy Maids in Black.

462
00:25:43,361 --> 00:25:46,075
Rym: And then there's the word "theme" and an arrow pointing at it.

463
00:25:48,045 --> 00:25:55,379
Rym: Uh, and just a little bit here, there's these funny Indian girls who don't talk, and they're probably one of the funniest bits in this manga so far.

464
00:25:56,403 --> 00:25:59,195
Rym: And the mangaka is like, "No one gets the purpose of the Indian

465
00:25:59,235 --> 00:25:59,498
Rym: girls.".

466
00:25:59,802 --> 00:26:02,857
Rym: And then a little text at the bottom, "Actually, I just kinda like this kind of

467
00:26:02,877 --> 00:26:03,200
Rym: character.".

468
00:26:05,582 --> 00:26:08,124
Rym: But Emma is the story of a maid.

469
00:26:08,185 --> 00:26:13,080
Rym: A pretty, uh, but, you know, pretty but plain maid in the typical maid sense, I guess.

470
00:26:13,763 --> 00:26:21,580
Rym: And in addition, a young gentleman named William, who is wealthy, but not a nobleman, but wealthy enough to where he can have all the pretensions of a nobleman.

471
00:26:21,661 --> 00:26:24,780
Rym: and he's young and his father is a wealthy, wealthy, wealthy businessman.

472
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,532
Scott: And she's their maid?

473
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:27,239
Scott: No, no, no.

474
00:26:27,541 --> 00:26:27,824
Scott: Oh, okay.

475
00:26:27,904 --> 00:26:29,580
Rym: She's the maid of a friend of the family.

476
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,042
Scott: Oh, okay.

477
00:26:30,915 --> 00:26:32,493
Rym: And there's a few other characters.

478
00:26:32,533 --> 00:26:38,108
Rym: There's this really funny, hilarious Indian prince who comes and stays with him for a while and all this stuff.

479
00:26:38,593 --> 00:26:43,480
Rym: And it's basically just a cute, charming love story set in the period.

480
00:26:44,504 --> 00:26:48,791
Rym: I mean, I could go on in much more detail, but I really don't want to ruin anything about this.

481
00:26:48,912 --> 00:26:50,489
Rym: It's heartwarming.

482
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:51,945
Rym: At times, it's serious.

483
00:26:52,390 --> 00:27:02,430
Rym: It's mostly funny but not in the stupid slapstick funny but more in the subtle kind of, uh, very underplayed and well executed humor.

484
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,539
Scott: Give an example of a joke.

485
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:08,047
Rym: Well, like, whenever, you know, William obviously fancies this girl, Emma.

486
00:27:08,148 --> 00:27:11,120
Rym: It's obvious from the start and it's actually portrayed kind of realistically.

487
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,763
Rym: You know, when two people are really, like, they like each other.

488
00:27:13,905 --> 00:27:16,108
Scott: Well, in those days, they had to be all courting and shit.

489
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:22,299
Rym: So they're a little flirty but they can't be too flirty and, like, you accidentally touch hands then you're both blushing back away.

490
00:27:23,402 --> 00:27:24,653
Scott: That's the anime for you.

491
00:27:24,855 --> 00:27:31,037
Rym: But the way it is portrayed and the way it is drawn and the way they talk to each other while they're doing this is just really fun.

492
00:27:31,078 --> 00:27:33,904
Rym: Like, the expressions on the character's faces really make it.

493
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:34,793
Rym: Kind of like in Nana.

494
00:27:35,096 --> 00:27:38,208
Rym: How half of Nana's humor is just the way the character's faces change.

495
00:27:38,551 --> 00:27:41,440
Scott: With those perfectly circular eyes or the dot in the middle, like,

496
00:27:41,682 --> 00:27:41,723
Scott: "Oh?".

497
00:27:42,229 --> 00:27:43,199
Rym: Yeah, this doesn't do that.

498
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:48,572
Rym: It does for really big eyes and characters on frame but they're looking down.

499
00:27:48,653 --> 00:28:04,299
Rym: or they're looking up or their eyes are cocked to the side and for some reason that with tiny realistic sweat drops together and charming dialogue are kind of this, it's funny but not in a laugh out loud way but in a, you're generally amused at all points.

500
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:05,642
Rym: Yes.

501
00:28:06,491 --> 00:28:13,119
Rym: Of course, this is interspersed by periodic moments of absolute crazy comedy gold.

502
00:28:13,683 --> 00:28:15,140
Rym: I'll ruin this because this isn't a big deal.

503
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:18,609
Rym: This Indian prince who is actually friends with William comes to visit.

504
00:28:19,113 --> 00:28:19,880
Rym: Incognito.

505
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:25,019
Rym: And by incognito meaning the next day the newspaper prince that he is visiting, incognito.

506
00:28:27,782 --> 00:28:28,085
Scott: Awesome.

507
00:28:28,348 --> 00:28:32,107
Rym: And then, you know, he gets off and he's got all these elephants with him because he's royalty.

508
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,983
Rym: He can bring elephants with him.

509
00:28:34,044 --> 00:28:34,893
Rym: He's got these elephants.

510
00:28:35,439 --> 00:28:38,372
Rym: And William is like, "You can't bring elephants into my house.

511
00:28:38,574 --> 00:28:39,665
Rym: You can't bring them here.

512
00:28:40,029 --> 00:28:40,292
Rym: This is

513
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:40,817
Rym: dangerous.".

514
00:28:41,141 --> 00:28:44,008
Rym: And the prince is like, "Elephants are perfectly docile and

515
00:28:44,049 --> 00:28:44,433
Rym: peaceful.".

516
00:28:45,101 --> 00:28:51,140
Rym: While he's saying this, one of the elephants goes berserk and starts attacking people and going on a rampage.

517
00:28:51,641 --> 00:28:54,453
Rym: And the whole time, he's chasing it down and trying to stop it.

518
00:28:54,655 --> 00:28:57,626
Rym: He's yelling back to William like, "This never happens.

519
00:28:57,666 --> 00:28:58,980
Rym: They're perfectly peaceful.

520
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,619
Rym: Nothing bad ever happens.

521
00:29:01,382 --> 00:29:02,272
Scott: This, this, blah blah

522
00:29:02,292 --> 00:29:02,555
Scott: blah.".

523
00:29:03,505 --> 00:29:10,916
Scott: Do you think that the mangaka was, you know, recognized that the maid fetish existed and sort of made this to be like, "Ha ha!

524
00:29:10,956 --> 00:29:11,299
Scott: Look at that!

525
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,064
Scott: Take that,

526
00:29:12,105 --> 00:29:12,409
Scott: bitches!".

527
00:29:12,571 --> 00:29:15,520
Rym: I get the impression that the mangaka has a maid fetish.

528
00:29:16,182 --> 00:29:16,304
Scott: Oh.

529
00:29:16,325 --> 00:29:16,916
Scott: Okay.

530
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:21,580
Scott: I thought it was more of like a, you know, "You crazy maid cafe people!

531
00:29:21,681 --> 00:29:24,952
Scott: I'm gonna make a maid manga that's serious and then you'll buy it by accident.

532
00:29:24,993 --> 00:29:25,316
Scott: Take that,

533
00:29:25,356 --> 00:29:25,638
Scott: bitches!".

534
00:29:25,881 --> 00:29:26,226
Rym: Well, no.

535
00:29:26,267 --> 00:29:33,240
Rym: She also did something else called Shirley, apparently, according to Wikipedia, which is also set in the similar time period.

536
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:33,866
Scott: Oh, okay.

537
00:29:34,209 --> 00:29:42,513
Rym: And if you read the little after manga, she basically is like, "I really like maids, and I really like England, and I wanted to make a manga about

538
00:29:42,574 --> 00:29:42,634
Rym: it.".

539
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:48,617
Rym: And she gets really, really excited about little things like, the littlest, So it's basically a fangirl made this?

540
00:29:48,678 --> 00:29:48,880
Scott: Yes.

541
00:29:49,081 --> 00:29:49,325
Scott: Okay.

542
00:29:49,977 --> 00:29:50,120
Scott: Cool.

543
00:29:51,142 --> 00:29:52,272
Rym: I don't want to ruin any more.

544
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:54,048
Rym: I don't want to talk about it in depth.

545
00:29:54,694 --> 00:29:59,100
Rym: I can't think of a single human being who wouldn't enjoy reading Emma.

546
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,679
Rym: They might not like enough to buy it all.

547
00:30:01,104 --> 00:30:02,379
Rym: Might not like enough to even buy it.

548
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:10,940
Rym: But if you get a chance, read the first volume of Emma, and I guarantee you'll smirk at least a couple times, and come out of it being enjoyed, being enjoyed?

549
00:30:11,341 --> 00:30:13,104
Rym: Come out of it feeling very happy.

550
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,223
Scott: There's also an anime.

551
00:30:15,587 --> 00:30:15,830
Scott: Yes.

552
00:30:16,032 --> 00:30:16,436
Scott: Pretty new.

553
00:30:16,497 --> 00:30:16,820
Scott: Real new.

554
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:25,736
Rym: I haven't seen the anime at all, but I looked at some screen captures that compared it to scenes in the manga, and at least as far as the style is concerned, they are dead on.

555
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,194
Rym: Dead freaking on.

556
00:30:28,315 --> 00:30:29,083
Rym: Kind of like Indiana.

557
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:29,770
Scott: Alright.

558
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:30,377
Scott: Alright.

559
00:30:30,457 --> 00:30:33,773
Scott: I'm gonna tell you about something that you might not know exists.

560
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:38,055
Scott: Well, I mean, you're either in the category of people who are like, "How could you not know about

561
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:38,379
Scott: that?".

562
00:30:38,702 --> 00:30:39,651
Scott: It's, like, obvious.

563
00:30:40,196 --> 00:30:42,540
Scott: Or you're in the category of people with, "What the fuck are you talking about?

564
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,328
Scott: I never heard of that in my

565
00:30:43,368 --> 00:30:43,570
Scott: life.".

566
00:30:44,338 --> 00:30:50,019
Scott: I'm gonna talk about Ode to Kirihito by the god of manga, Osamu Tezuka.

567
00:30:50,660 --> 00:31:04,260
Scott: Now, this, it's from vertical publishing, which is the same people who's publishing Buddha, and they're publishing Tutera, and the Guin Saga, and basically they publish all the really really highbrow manga.

568
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:05,166
Scott: All of it.

569
00:31:05,349 --> 00:31:06,100
Scott: Most of it, anyway.

570
00:31:07,063 --> 00:31:09,020
Scott: Whatever they have that someone else didn't already publish.

571
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,404
Scott: Now, Ode to Kirihito is something that has never been in English, ever.

572
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:16,879
Scott: It was written in, let's see, what year does this say?

573
00:31:16,879 --> 00:31:18,861
Scott: 1970 and 1971.

574
00:31:18,861 --> 00:31:25,778
Scott: It was published by Osamu Tezuka in Bigu Komiku Shogakan.

575
00:31:27,824 --> 00:31:29,516
Scott: And it didn't get here until now.

576
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:33,612
Scott: Ode to Kirihito is one giant manga.

577
00:31:33,672 --> 00:31:34,460
Scott: It's all one book.

578
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,175
Scott: You can't buy separate volumes of it.

579
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:37,972
Rym: It's one of those "hit someone over the head with it" books.

580
00:31:38,093 --> 00:31:38,760
Scott: It's pretty big.

581
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,440
Scott: I mean, it takes up your whole hand.

582
00:31:40,782 --> 00:31:41,671
Scott: It's kinda hard.

583
00:31:41,894 --> 00:31:43,873
Scott: This thing's like two inches thick, what are you saying?

584
00:31:43,893 --> 00:31:44,580
Scott: Two and a half, maybe?

585
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,003
Rym: More than that.

586
00:31:45,387 --> 00:31:45,629
Scott: Yeah.

587
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,740
Rym: But at least it's bound well.

588
00:31:47,123 --> 00:31:47,750
Rym: Not like Erze Asura.

589
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,852
Scott: Yeah, it's not gonna fall apart when you read this thing.

590
00:31:49,892 --> 00:31:53,851
Scott: It's also got a pretty cool cover where this thing slides back and forth.

591
00:31:53,952 --> 00:31:55,406
Scott: It's really a high quality production.

592
00:31:55,912 --> 00:31:59,479
Scott: Of course, it is $25, but I got it at a discount because I'm awesome.

593
00:32:00,883 --> 00:32:09,508
Scott: It is a medical drama from 1970, before shows like ER and whatever other medical dramas you watch today existed.

594
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:18,660
Scott: You know, you read stuff like Blackjack, which is also by Tezuka, or you play Trauma Center, or what other medical dramas are out there.

595
00:32:18,721 --> 00:32:19,651
Scott: I can't even think of any.

596
00:32:20,278 --> 00:32:23,575
Scott: But as far as I know, this house I don't know what house is.

597
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,700
Scott: Is it a medical drama?

598
00:32:26,564 --> 00:32:27,654
Rym: I don't know, whatever.

599
00:32:27,674 --> 00:32:34,036
Scott: But this, it's like you know, you play Knifey Spoonie, like you know, oh, this is a knife.

600
00:32:34,137 --> 00:32:35,873
Scott: No, this is a knife.

601
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,160
Rym: I see you've played Knifey Spoonie before.

602
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,520
Scott: Someone comes up and says, this is a medical drama.

603
00:32:40,621 --> 00:32:43,698
Scott: I say, no, this is a medical drama.

604
00:32:44,903 --> 00:32:45,611
Scott: Oh, Monster.

605
00:32:45,692 --> 00:32:50,379
Scott: Monster, if you read Ode to Kirihito, Monster is going to seem half as good as it is.

606
00:32:51,146 --> 00:32:55,409
Rym: Yeah, so if you're currently reading Monster, finish it before you pick this up.

607
00:32:55,692 --> 00:33:00,177
Scott: That's right, because you're going to read this and then you're going to go back to Monster and be like, wow, that was a ripoff, wasn't it?

608
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,459
Scott: Well, Monster's ripoff of this.

609
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:11,124
Scott: Oh, and one other thing I just had to say before I tell you about what actually goes on in this manga, is that it is left to right, but it doesn't matter.

610
00:33:11,468 --> 00:33:26,663
Scott: You know, vertical doesn't seem to go along with the whole flipping the pages, well, not flipping the pages that you can read right to left, but if you can freaking read it, everything makes sense, you know, and the translations are of the highest quality and the fonts are really good.

611
00:33:27,127 --> 00:33:32,039
Scott: You can give this to someone and you know, they probably would never know that it was originally in Japanese.

612
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,187
Scott: Well, I guess, you know, you can kind of tell from Tezuka's art style that it's kind of Japanese, but whatever.

613
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:38,540
Rym: Or from the name Kirihito.

614
00:33:39,202 --> 00:33:40,680
Scott: Right, yeah, that would do it too.

615
00:33:40,901 --> 00:33:42,785
Rym: I mean, they could completely anglicize it, I guess.

616
00:33:42,805 --> 00:33:44,885
Scott: Or the fact that it says so right in front of the book.

617
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:49,089
Rym: See, if they remade it, you know, and localized it, it'd be owed to John.

618
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:49,190
Rym: Yeah.

619
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:53,288
Scott: Anyway, the story is about a doctor, Dr.

620
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,330
Scott: Kirihito.

621
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:55,676
Scott: Oh.

622
00:33:56,241 --> 00:33:56,644
Scott: And Dr.

623
00:33:56,685 --> 00:33:58,239
Scott: Kirihito is an awesome doctor.

624
00:33:58,884 --> 00:34:01,894
Scott: And basically, he's working on this patient.

625
00:34:02,257 --> 00:34:04,200
Scott: And this patient is in room 66.

626
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:04,422
Scott: Dum, dum, dum.

627
00:34:07,466 --> 00:34:12,219
Scott: And the patient has a really strange disease that turned it into a beast of some sort.

628
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:15,672
Scott: And his whole head is becoming malformed.

629
00:34:15,693 --> 00:34:16,905
Scott: He's growing hair all over.

630
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:20,925
Scott: And he's basically becoming a horrible monster, and he's also dying.

631
00:34:21,551 --> 00:34:29,309
Scott: So the doctor is really struggling to discover more about this disease, find a cure for it, what causes it, et cetera.

632
00:34:29,856 --> 00:34:37,409
Scott: There's big arguments going on in the medical community, whether it's a virus, or a bacteria, or if it's endemic, or who knows.

633
00:34:38,138 --> 00:34:47,454
Scott: And it gets pretty intense, because people are all corrupt, you know, and they're trying to screw other people out of research, and you know, all kinds of stuff.

634
00:34:47,614 --> 00:34:51,107
Scott: Mishandling the patients, doing all sorts of shady dealings.

635
00:34:52,257 --> 00:35:07,308
Scott: And basically, stuff, I don't want to know how much I want to go and spoil it, but the doctor ends up going on a crazy quest around the world in all sorts of different crazy situations, you know, that are very intense.

636
00:35:07,815 --> 00:35:10,219
Scott: Pretty much every moment is intense throughout this whole thing.

637
00:35:10,781 --> 00:35:13,191
Scott: You're constantly going, "What's going to happen now?

638
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:14,038
Scott: What's going to happen

639
00:35:14,058 --> 00:35:14,240
Scott: there?".

640
00:35:16,107 --> 00:35:16,956
Scott: And it's wow.

641
00:35:18,985 --> 00:35:20,060
Scott: It's really heavy shit.

642
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,927
Scott: Not only is the paper heavy, but the story is heavy as well.

643
00:35:22,947 --> 00:35:23,533
Scott: Well, consider this.

644
00:35:23,553 --> 00:35:28,219
Rym: Scott was reading it off and on while we were at the Northern Geek House having a party.

645
00:35:28,522 --> 00:35:28,705
Rym: Yep.

646
00:35:28,988 --> 00:35:33,979
Rym: And the fact that he could be distracted from a party by a manga says a lot.

647
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:46,585
Scott: And not only is there the story of the doctor on his adventure around the world to, you know, deal with his problems, but there's all these other sort of peak characters that have their own story.

648
00:35:46,605 --> 00:35:49,837
Scott: It's like, you know, there's the corrupt doctor still back in Japan.

649
00:35:49,938 --> 00:35:50,645
Scott: What's he doing?

650
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:56,930
Scott: Then there's the, you know, the other kind of sketchy doctor who's kind of bad and kind of good.

651
00:35:56,971 --> 00:35:57,638
Scott: What's he up to?

652
00:35:58,261 --> 00:36:05,667
Scott: Then, you know, you've got his quest to find the disease, but you've also got his wife or his fiancé.

653
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:06,460
Scott: What's she doing?

654
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,320
Scott: stuck in Japan after he ran away?

655
00:36:09,081 --> 00:36:11,250
Scott: You know, and all this crazy stuff goes on.

656
00:36:11,311 --> 00:36:15,309
Scott: And in the end, after the end of how many pages of this freaking thing?

657
00:36:15,895 --> 00:36:16,460
Rym: A lot.

658
00:36:16,661 --> 00:36:17,348
Rym: I would wager 600.

659
00:36:17,348 --> 00:36:19,728
Rym: It's 822 pages.

660
00:36:19,748 --> 00:36:20,400
Rym: Yeah, it was close.

661
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,652
Scott: They actually managed to tie everything together.

662
00:36:23,713 --> 00:36:24,400
Scott: It's like a miracle.

663
00:36:25,001 --> 00:36:25,507
Scott: Damn.

664
00:36:25,568 --> 00:36:31,066
Scott: And you've got to read, when you're reading this thing, not only do you have to realize, this whole thing is by Osamu Tezuka, one guy.

665
00:36:31,209 --> 00:36:31,900
Scott: Art and story.

666
00:36:32,344 --> 00:36:34,020
Scott: You know, just like all of other Tezuka's works.

667
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:42,243
Scott: But if you've read other Tezuka stuff like Buddha or Phoenix or Astro Boy, I've read a lot of it.

668
00:36:42,485 --> 00:36:45,939
Scott: And this, I'd have to say is the most polished of all of them.

669
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,439
Scott: You know, the other ones have a few, you know, silly bits here.

670
00:36:49,923 --> 00:36:53,174
Scott: Or they have, you know, some kind of sketchy stuff there.

671
00:36:53,296 --> 00:36:56,546
Scott: Sometimes something doesn't make complete sense in one spot or another.

672
00:36:56,566 --> 00:36:59,229
Scott: This is freaking polished.

673
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:04,506
Scott: It's as if he wrote the whole thing and double checked everything and made sure it was all perfect.

674
00:37:05,314 --> 00:37:11,480
Scott: And I don't know, I don't know if it's the best Tezuka work, because Phoenix is just so much more epic in its scope.

675
00:37:12,042 --> 00:37:17,360
Scott: But the quality level is the same if the plot is not as epic.

676
00:37:18,061 --> 00:37:28,769
Scott: If you like doctors or, you know, I don't know, science fiction stories that are, you know, all giving you a big message.

677
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:30,672
Rym: If you like dramas and thrillers.

678
00:37:30,956 --> 00:37:31,260
Scott: Yeah.

679
00:37:32,404 --> 00:37:33,640
Scott: This is where it's at, people.

680
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:39,218
Rym: Anything dramatic thriller, doctor, gun, running, science, fighting spy.

681
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:40,868
Scott: Anything like that.

682
00:37:40,888 --> 00:37:41,620
Scott: And it doesn't have too much spy.

683
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,299
Scott: It has a little bit of spy at one point.

684
00:37:44,024 --> 00:37:52,869
Scott: But yeah, world hopping, crazy medical adventures of, you know, Jekyll and Hyde type stuff, Frankenstein type stuff.

685
00:37:53,373 --> 00:37:54,222
Scott: This is where it's at.

686
00:37:54,363 --> 00:37:56,646
Scott: This is like 1970.

687
00:37:56,646 --> 00:38:07,112
Scott: And the scary thing is, you look at this, in 1970, someone was writing one of the most serious and revolutionary medical drama stories ever in a graphic novel.

688
00:38:07,657 --> 00:38:14,179
Scott: Meanwhile, in 1970, the comic books in the United States were the corniest, corny, cornball crap you ever saw.

689
00:38:14,701 --> 00:38:15,760
Scott: So this is worth reading.

690
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,440
Scott: Because you'll fucking learn something.

691
00:38:18,581 --> 00:38:26,748
Rym: So just as an aside, before we close out this week of us being tired between one holiday and another holiday, Katsucon!

692
00:38:26,768 --> 00:38:28,388
Rym: In February.

693
00:38:28,792 --> 00:38:29,480
Rym: It's a ways off.

694
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,339
Rym: We're not going to talk about it a lot yet.

695
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:37,940
Rym: But it looks like we are going to be emceeing the video game room in some capacity.

696
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:53,051
Rym: Meaning that if you come to Katsucon, we will be in the video game room making noise, running panels, doing game shows, having trash talk Mario Tennis tournaments, doing interviews, and generally making a ruckus for the whole con.

697
00:38:53,274 --> 00:38:57,279
Scott: We're going to be doing more at Katsucon than at any con we have done previously.

698
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:04,019
Rym: Yeah, I mean, we'll get you more details once we hammer them out with the con, but they asked us, you know, what can you do?

699
00:39:04,181 --> 00:39:09,740
Rym: And we sent back the list of like, well we can do this kind of event, we can do this kind of event, or we can do this kind of layout and this kind of thing.

700
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,979
Rym: You know, the stuff we send to cons.

701
00:39:11,681 --> 00:39:13,113
Rym: And they got back to us and they basically said,

702
00:39:13,134 --> 00:39:13,194
Rym: "Yes.".

703
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:20,728
Rym: So we still have to deal with all the logistics of getting down and we have to do all our stuff.

704
00:39:20,748 --> 00:39:24,326
Scott: Yeah, the thing about Katsucon is the hotel that Katsucon is in is in Washington,

705
00:39:24,346 --> 00:39:24,711
Scott: D.C.,

706
00:39:24,731 --> 00:39:25,359
Scott: which kind of sucks.

707
00:39:26,003 --> 00:39:27,460
Scott: And it's sold out, which kind of sucks.

708
00:39:28,082 --> 00:39:31,312
Scott: So if you want to go, you're going to have to stay in this overflow hotel.

709
00:39:31,352 --> 00:39:34,747
Scott: that's a mile away and it's not going to be the greatest thing in the world.

710
00:39:35,091 --> 00:39:35,960
Rym: But that won't be so bad.

711
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:42,199
Rym: I mean, I kind of counted on our friends having a room because they usually get one every year, but they ended up only having two spots.

712
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,577
Rym: And along with Scott Johnson, there are three of us.

713
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,692
Rym: Thus, no go.

714
00:39:46,896 --> 00:39:47,099
Scott: Yep.

715
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:48,771
Rym: But it won't be a big deal.

716
00:39:48,811 --> 00:39:49,498
Rym: We'll deal with it.

717
00:39:50,163 --> 00:39:52,371
Rym: Because there's no way we're missing in Katsucon.

718
00:39:52,633 --> 00:39:54,640
Scott: Not with the kind of stuff that they're going to let us pull there.

719
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:58,738
Rym: I've gone for the last few years and this will be Scott's first Katsucon, but I think he'll really like it.

720
00:39:59,462 --> 00:40:04,658
Rym: Especially if we're in the video game room showing punk kids what it really means to be good at Mario Tennis.

721
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:09,948
Scott: Yeah, it's basically a portion of Katsucon will be Heek Knight's Con and you can all come and enjoy it.

722
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:13,360
Scott: Yeah, I mean, our plan is Not to mention the rest of Katsucon, which will probably be great.

723
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,460
Rym: Yeah, Katsucon is really freaking awesome.

724
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:17,199
Rym: It's one of my favorite cons.

725
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,138
Scott: We should bring Katsu.

726
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:24,959
Rym: I mean, honestly, of all time, Otakon Katsucon Anime Central are probably my three favorite cons ever.

727
00:40:25,943 --> 00:40:26,185
Scott: Alright.

728
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:31,460
Rym: So we'll get you more details as they come out, but You can always go to the Katsucon website.

729
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:38,231
Rym: Yes, you can, and if you live anywhere in the southeastern United States Southeastern?

730
00:40:38,251 --> 00:40:41,500
Rym: You mean mid-eastern, where Maryland is.

731
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:41,824
Rym: You know what?

732
00:40:41,946 --> 00:40:43,080
Rym: Anywhere east of the Mississippi.

733
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,826
Scott: Katsucon 13 Omni Shoreham Hotel, Washington D.C.

734
00:40:47,907 --> 00:40:49,281
Scott: February 16th through 18th, 2007.

735
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:52,778
Scott: Katsucon.com There you go.

736
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:53,381
Rym: Yes.

737
00:40:54,027 --> 00:40:55,420
Scott: Cosplay registration is closed.

738
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,339
Scott: Artist Alley is full.

739
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,146
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

753
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,398
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

754
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,113
Scott: I don't know what I'm going to give away.

755
00:42:30,315 --> 00:42:30,699
Scott: We'll see.

756
00:42:31,202 --> 00:42:32,279
Rym: Oh, you're going to give something away?

757
00:42:32,622 --> 00:42:32,985
Rym: I don't know.

758
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:34,480
Rym: On Things of the Day?

759
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,579
Scott: They're going to get no job.

760
00:42:36,441 --> 00:42:37,490
Scott: They're going to go to school.

761
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,519
Scott: They're going to get no job.

762
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,939
Rym: Alright, we should probably explain what that was.

763
00:42:42,501 --> 00:42:43,240
