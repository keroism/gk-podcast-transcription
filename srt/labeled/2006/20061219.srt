1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,527
Rym: It's Tuesday December 19th.

2
00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:14,457
Rym: I'm Rym and I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:15,159 --> 00:00:19,639
Rym: tonight We talk a bit about what makes good board games good and fun board games fun.

4
00:00:20,962 --> 00:00:21,956
Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:36,560
Rym: So despite the fact that the computer is sitting next to my computer the one I do the podcast on the computer That is you know one gigahertz that is old as hell Barely functions has no case fans.

6
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:45,109
Rym: In fact, the only fan in the entire case that's spinning is the CPU pan fan, which periodically stops spinning a computer is no good.

7
00:00:45,732 --> 00:00:54,640
Rym: yet that computer is Noticeably and significantly faster and better performing than the fastest computer in our house.

8
00:00:55,406 --> 00:01:06,091
Scott: I think there's just something wrong, you know I mean while the CPU in that computer is the fastest CPU in our house that is currently active Actually, it's the fastest CPU in the house period.

9
00:01:06,614 --> 00:01:06,935
Scott: I don't know.

10
00:01:06,955 --> 00:01:08,040
Scott: Maybe the Wii is faster.

11
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,965
Rym: No, who is not faster than this?

12
00:01:10,185 --> 00:01:12,371
Scott: Who knows a sempron 2500 plus?

13
00:01:12,712 --> 00:01:12,872
Rym: Yeah.

14
00:01:12,992 --> 00:01:18,225
Scott: Anyway, the sempron 2500 plus is in a $20 motherboard.

15
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:40,720
Rym: now, I don't see any reasonable situation or circumstance that would cause a CPU that happens to be in a cheap motherboard as opposed to a good motherboard to max out at a hundred percent When I do such complex tasks as clicking on a link in Firefox Moving a mouse in Firefox looking at Firefox or loading a web page in fire.

16
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,640
Scott: It is also a CPU that was damaged by heat at least now again heat damage to CPU.

17
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,600
Rym: We're generally not cause that type of problem.

18
00:01:49,881 --> 00:01:56,380
Scott: I'm just saying is that there are many many hidden factors far beyond our vision that could be causing this problem.

19
00:01:56,621 --> 00:01:57,084
Rym: I don't know.

20
00:01:57,104 --> 00:01:57,668
Rym: I don't know.

21
00:01:57,688 --> 00:01:58,654
Rym: I got a plan.

22
00:01:58,674 --> 00:02:04,660
Rym: if I ever have time I want to build a Gentoo on it and see if there's a software issue or a hardware issue.

23
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:15,237
Scott: My guess is that is a combination software hardware issue where because it is a $20 motherboard The software does things in such a way and they $20 actually perhaps out of the way.

24
00:02:15,317 --> 00:02:16,180
Rym: what I would blame?

25
00:02:16,341 --> 00:02:18,180
Rym: I hate to say this but I might blame Ubuntu.

26
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:20,364
Rym: Now here's one dude.

27
00:02:20,404 --> 00:02:25,779
Rym: Remember we tried to install edgy on this computer and it totally bit the bullet and fucked up.

28
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:32,444
Rym: So we had the motherboards $20, uh, yeah, so we installed the older Ubuntu Dapper Drake.

29
00:02:32,726 --> 00:02:34,836
Rym: Mm-hmm, and then we upgraded to edgy.

30
00:02:34,856 --> 00:02:35,499
Rym: Mm-hmm.

31
00:02:35,846 --> 00:02:37,840
Rym: I'm Would wager that?

32
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:44,520
Rym: Upgrading to edgy brought with it a bunch of performance problems the same likes of which we saw when we tried to originally install edgy.

33
00:02:44,722 --> 00:02:55,940
Rym: but if you think those The problems we had when we tried to originally install edgy were that it was slow as hell Installing and then would crap out which is the same thing that this PC is doing now randomly and periodically.

34
00:02:56,304 --> 00:02:57,899
Scott: But that's totally unrelated.

35
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:03,294
Scott: The pro there's nothing to do with it because the live CD of edgy was not slow.

36
00:03:03,314 --> 00:03:04,096
Rym: Yeah, it was.

37
00:03:04,798 --> 00:03:05,240
Scott: no was.

38
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:13,592
Rym: yeah I was the edgy live CD barely booted and maxed out the CPU and anyway Any dapper CD is what I used to do anything on the box.

39
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:15,560
Scott: if that is the case that you know?

40
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,326
Scott: For some reason edgy is slow.

41
00:03:17,346 --> 00:03:19,414
Scott: edgy is not slow on my computer.

42
00:03:19,434 --> 00:03:19,776
Scott: Therefore.

43
00:03:19,796 --> 00:03:20,860
Scott: It's not a problem with edgy.

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:30,112
Scott: It is as I said a combination of edgy and the 20 other board is a problem with edgy not supporting a otherwise generally standard motherboards.

45
00:03:30,112 --> 00:03:33,304
Scott: $20 shitty ass Motherboard.

46
00:03:33,304 --> 00:03:34,447
Rym: $20 motherboard should work.

47
00:03:34,487 --> 00:03:37,094
Scott: what you fucking pay for mean what you paid for.

48
00:03:37,114 --> 00:03:38,216
Scott: That's right.

49
00:03:38,998 --> 00:03:39,540
Rym: Good job.

50
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:42,970
Scott: Hey, we wanted it to be as cheap as possible.

51
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:43,632
Scott: That's what we got.

52
00:03:43,792 --> 00:03:44,314
Scott: It works.

53
00:03:44,334 --> 00:03:44,997
Scott: You know, it doesn't.

54
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:46,000
Rym: it's useless.

55
00:03:46,341 --> 00:03:46,843
Scott: It works.

56
00:03:46,863 --> 00:03:49,772
Scott: You should be happy that a $20 motherboard even work.

57
00:03:49,853 --> 00:03:51,919
Rym: Oh, no, the motherboard works, but the PC is useless.

58
00:03:53,702 --> 00:03:53,782
Rym: It.

59
00:03:54,124 --> 00:03:55,027
Scott: it was 20 bucks.

60
00:03:55,147 --> 00:03:56,051
Scott: you can't complain.

61
00:03:56,151 --> 00:03:58,419
Rym: I'd rather have the 20 bucks then the computer sitting here now.

62
00:03:58,841 --> 00:04:00,548
Scott: What the fuck for 20 bucks?

63
00:04:00,628 --> 00:04:02,476
Scott: What other but better a computer you're gonna get.

64
00:04:02,496 --> 00:04:05,551
Scott: that's the best computer You can get in the whole world for $20.

65
00:04:05,551 --> 00:04:06,415
Rym: It wouldn't be worth it.

66
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:07,139
Rym: It doesn't work.

67
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:09,688
Scott: It works just fine.

68
00:04:09,728 --> 00:04:10,655
Scott: You're browsing the web.

69
00:04:10,715 --> 00:04:11,359
Rym: Oh, no, I'm not.

70
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:13,145
Rym: Firefox is crash.

71
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:16,320
Rym: It's just sitting there because the page that I want to do my news from is still open.

72
00:04:16,641 --> 00:04:18,327
Scott: It's not crash it.

73
00:04:18,406 --> 00:04:22,200
Rym: if I try to move between tabs it'll sit there for like five minutes.

74
00:04:22,501 --> 00:04:23,445
Scott: It won't sit there for five.

75
00:04:23,465 --> 00:04:23,707
Scott: Yeah.

76
00:04:23,767 --> 00:04:26,459
Scott: Well, no, it won't anyway, that's so hyperbole.

77
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,930
Rym: now All right, any of our listeners live near us.

78
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,240
Rym: come over and I'll show you this shit piece of a computer.

79
00:04:32,162 --> 00:04:36,445
Scott: It's just the slightest bit of slowness Upset slightest bit of slowness.

80
00:04:36,706 --> 00:04:46,080
Rym: It's less than a quarter as fast at encoding mp3s or Processing wav files as my crap as seven year old barely functioning computer.

81
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,127
Scott: $20 motherboard.

82
00:04:47,147 --> 00:04:51,548
Rym: Yeah Anyway, what you got in the news?

83
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:52,892
Rym: This isn't tech day.

84
00:04:52,932 --> 00:05:06,793
Scott: I imagine a lot of our listeners have no idea what we're talking about right, so today after a long period of waiting the we weather channel is Available and working for free and you know what?

85
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:08,760
Scott: It's not so exciting.

86
00:05:09,364 --> 00:05:10,873
Rym: Well, it's exactly what I expected.

87
00:05:10,913 --> 00:05:11,980
Rym: It's not supposed to be exciting.

88
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:21,900
Scott: No, well, I mean it's like you sit there and you have this we and it says weather channel coming soon and you're like Ooh, I can't wait for the weather channel to be available.

89
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:28,560
Scott: Finally, here it is the weather channel and you go and you look at it and it's just the fucking weather.

90
00:05:29,301 --> 00:05:31,251
Scott: It takes you about like five minutes and you go.

91
00:05:31,311 --> 00:05:35,796
Scott: Ooh, look I can spin the globe around I can see the weather in Antarctica and that's fun once.

92
00:05:37,182 --> 00:05:38,907
Scott: Now you have the weather.

93
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:44,618
Rym: the purpose of it is to be able to easily look at the weather on your john your TV and That it does.

94
00:05:45,322 --> 00:05:54,267
Scott: Well, I mean if you want to find out what the current weather is not so useful because like I looked at it Just now at 6 p.m.

95
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:59,147
Scott: And it gave me the wet the current weather in Poughkeepsie from 6 a.m.

96
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:03,280
Scott: So that wasn't too helpful, but the five-day forecast was kind of useful.

97
00:06:03,521 --> 00:06:06,530
Scott: I was like, hey, it's gonna it's gonna be rainy and snowy on Saturday.

98
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:17,099
Rym: Uh, really because the NOAA doesn't say that at all Let me go see because I looked at the NOAA this morning for Yonkers Which is close to here and it said it was gonna be warm all weekend.

99
00:06:18,082 --> 00:06:20,494
Scott: I know the NOAA agrees Saturday 60% rain likely, huh?

100
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,379
Scott: Because this morning I looked at Yonkers said sunny all weekend weather and Yonkers is not the weather in beacon in Poughkeepsie.

101
00:06:28,481 --> 00:06:30,568
Scott: It's a different place except it's real close.

102
00:06:30,809 --> 00:06:31,852
Scott: It's pretty close.

103
00:06:32,193 --> 00:06:33,578
Rym: We'll see if it actually rains though.

104
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:34,280
Scott: We'll see.

105
00:06:34,522 --> 00:06:35,490
Scott: It's 60% chance.

106
00:06:35,531 --> 00:06:36,499
Scott: So I'll bet you.

107
00:06:38,082 --> 00:06:40,130
Rym: I thought you didn't bet unless it was a sure deal.

108
00:06:40,331 --> 00:06:42,480
Scott: It's a sure deal if I bet on six to four odds.

109
00:06:43,122 --> 00:06:44,967
Rym: No, it's not six to four.

110
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:47,714
Rym: That means that there's a chance that the four odds will win.

111
00:06:47,895 --> 00:06:49,740
Rym: There's a 40% chance that you'll lose.

112
00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:51,664
Rym: It's not a sure thing.

113
00:06:51,684 --> 00:06:54,092
Rym: I don't know what definition a sure thing you're trying to.

114
00:06:54,172 --> 00:06:57,098
Scott: sure enough because the bed is exactly the same as the odds.

115
00:06:58,521 --> 00:07:00,266
Rym: That logic does not follow the.

116
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:05,440
Rym: the gains of a bed and the chance of winning the bed are mute are not.

117
00:07:05,964 --> 00:07:08,559
Rym: They're completely separate things whatever.

118
00:07:10,242 --> 00:07:13,139
Rym: By that lock, I'm not gonna get into what that logic entails.

119
00:07:14,824 --> 00:07:16,360
Scott: Yeah, but no the Weather Channel.

120
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:20,933
Scott: I mean You're gonna look at it right away because it's something new and interesting to do on the Wii.

121
00:07:21,355 --> 00:07:27,014
Scott: on the Wii and the channels Are the most fun part of the Wii but the Weather Channel is not gonna be.

122
00:07:27,596 --> 00:07:29,462
Scott: it's not the entertainment channel It's it's.

123
00:07:29,864 --> 00:07:33,920
Scott: you're gonna go there maybe once in a while to see what the weather is.

124
00:07:34,443 --> 00:07:35,249
Rym: Yeah, I don't know what.

125
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,780
Rym: that's exactly what I expected it to be.

126
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,260
Rym: I figured if we had people over and you know, hey Rym, let's climb the mountain tomorrow.

127
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,245
Rym: What's the weather gonna be like?

128
00:07:42,305 --> 00:07:42,667
Rym: I'd go?

129
00:07:42,988 --> 00:07:44,234
Rym: Hey we what's the weather gonna be?

130
00:07:44,254 --> 00:07:46,123
Rym: and the Wii would turn me and say it's gonna Be sunny Rym.

131
00:07:46,143 --> 00:07:52,118
Rym: We're gonna climb that mountain and I would say see and that is pretty much the maximum enjoyment I expected to get out of that.

132
00:07:52,781 --> 00:08:00,520
Scott: that's about all you're gonna get because the only other thing you can do is As a globe that you can spin around and check the weather in different parts of the world.

133
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,626
Rym: You sound so disappointed like you expected more.

134
00:08:02,646 --> 00:08:04,231
Rym: Yeah, what did you expect?

135
00:08:04,271 --> 00:08:04,893
Rym: What were you?

136
00:08:05,013 --> 00:08:06,237
Rym: What did you think was gonna come?

137
00:08:06,257 --> 00:08:06,277
Rym: I?

138
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,115
Scott: Wanted to have that globe part be a little more interesting.

139
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:10,900
Rym: How so?

140
00:08:12,621 --> 00:08:17,420
Scott: Have like little pictures of ice climbers in the Himalayas that I could find like a secret.

141
00:08:17,822 --> 00:08:18,144
Rym: How do you know?

142
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:18,666
Rym: they're not there?

143
00:08:18,747 --> 00:08:19,611
Rym: used didn't look hard enough.

144
00:08:19,672 --> 00:08:19,953
Scott: I did.

145
00:08:19,993 --> 00:08:21,099
Scott: I looked I zoomed in all the way.

146
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:27,300
Rym: You you're telling me that you actually sat there and looked at all the pixels in the Himalayas.

147
00:08:28,261 --> 00:08:29,647
Scott: You really can't zoom in that far.

148
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,275
Scott: So it didn't take very long.

149
00:08:31,295 --> 00:08:32,419
Rym: Yeah, they might be tiny.

150
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:33,686
Scott: You want to look.

151
00:08:33,826 --> 00:08:35,615
Rym: you might have to click on something special.

152
00:08:36,097 --> 00:08:36,679
Scott: Why don't you go?

153
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,340
Scott: Look, why don't you zoom in on Canada and see if there's an ice hockey player?

154
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,446
Rym: Do you know where the Himalayas are?

155
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:41,432
Scott: Yeah, they're in Tibet.

156
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:45,307
Scott: Okay, okay I know I know where the shit is.

157
00:08:45,327 --> 00:08:46,833
Scott: Oh, you know what?

158
00:08:46,933 --> 00:08:51,832
Scott: I did learn one thing from Google not Google.

159
00:08:52,095 --> 00:08:52,560
Scott: we weather.

160
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:57,596
Scott: Okay, what I learned that Easter Island is I didn't actually know where it was like.

161
00:08:57,656 --> 00:08:58,820
Scott: I thought I knew but I was wrong.

162
00:09:00,622 --> 00:09:03,220
Scott: Now I know where Easter Island is so we can go there.

163
00:09:03,802 --> 00:09:04,626
Scott: Do you want to go there?

164
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:05,128
Scott: Not really?

165
00:09:05,268 --> 00:09:06,855
Scott: No, no now that I know where it is.

166
00:09:06,915 --> 00:09:15,027
Scott: I kind of don't want to go Like where I thought before it was closer to Europe, but now that I realize it's to the west of South America So screw that.

167
00:09:17,882 --> 00:09:24,831
Scott: The other news that's more interesting is we finally have Confirmation on the deal with the Opera browser for the Wii.

168
00:09:24,992 --> 00:09:25,534
Rym: it's coming.

169
00:09:25,996 --> 00:09:27,220
Scott: It's coming on Friday.

170
00:09:27,682 --> 00:09:32,500
Scott: Well, first of all opera put out this cute little comic with a little red ninja to tell us all about it and a spider.

171
00:09:33,004 --> 00:09:33,448
Scott: It's pretty cool.

172
00:09:34,012 --> 00:09:45,620
Scott: But on Friday as in this Friday the 22nd There's going to be a free trial version of opera browser for Wii available.

173
00:09:46,904 --> 00:09:53,040
Scott: It's not going to be the full version It's gonna be like the beta version but it's gonna be free to anyone with a Wii.

174
00:09:53,622 --> 00:09:56,820
Rym: So so is that implying that the final version is going to be non free?

175
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:04,660
Scott: They didn't say like the final version is going to cost money because they didn't say the final version is free.

176
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,040
Scott: They said this version is a free beta available Friday.

177
00:10:08,602 --> 00:10:17,740
Scott: I suppose that it'll be lacking features that you're gonna want probably Yeah, like and I suppose like the ability to follow links or view images.

178
00:10:18,462 --> 00:10:24,659
Scott: I suppose that it will have some bugs if you know that might get updated over time crashes immediately if you click on anything.

179
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:28,772
Scott: and Yeah, that that's what I'm supposing.

180
00:10:29,355 --> 00:10:32,771
Scott: in the spring They say it in this little comic that it says.

181
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,900
Scott: my ninja sense says spring.

182
00:10:37,061 --> 00:10:49,566
Scott: In the spring the full version is supposedly going to come out and we can only assume logically that it will not be free, but it will probably be free of bugs and It'll have all the features.

183
00:10:49,687 --> 00:10:50,973
Scott: It just will cost monies.

184
00:10:50,993 --> 00:11:02,951
Scott: Yeah Well, I think this is actually kind of good because if they just put out the opera browser and said here pay money for it You know, it's a tough call who would buy it and who wouldn't?

185
00:11:03,754 --> 00:11:09,116
Scott: if they just put it out for free Well, then they're not making any money off of that, you know, so it's not good for them.

186
00:11:09,537 --> 00:11:17,200
Scott: this way people who are early adopters of the Wii can get the browser and Try it out and solve the bugs and all that good stuff.

187
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:26,839
Scott: And if we decide that we like it a lot if I keep using that browser a lot on the Wii Then I'm probably gonna shell out and pay for the full version when it comes out.

188
00:11:27,361 --> 00:11:32,176
Scott: But if I don't use it so much then I'm not gonna pay for see the way I look at it.

189
00:11:32,838 --> 00:11:41,515
Rym: being geeks we have a Mac Mini already plugged into the TV and We can now pretty much and is getting better by the day use our remotes with that Mac Mini.

190
00:11:41,937 --> 00:11:42,880
Scott: Yeah, that is good.

191
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:52,992
Scott: However, the opera Wii browser is specially designed to work with the Wii and is much easier to navigate with the wiimote than the Firefox Mac with tiny tiny buttons.

192
00:11:53,133 --> 00:12:00,700
Rym: Yeah, but we'll see If the money versus usefulness ratio is in the proper level, yeah, I mean I'll pay.

193
00:12:01,942 --> 00:12:02,686
Scott: That's the other thing.

194
00:12:02,727 --> 00:12:13,020
Scott: It's great because I'll be able to figure out Through the coming months, you know I got three or four months here to decide how much it's worth to me to pay for that opera browser.

195
00:12:13,401 --> 00:12:17,816
Scott: So when it finally comes out in the spring, I'll say you you're charging too much.

196
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:18,780
Scott: You're charging not enough.

197
00:12:19,343 --> 00:12:26,260
Rym: I really am much more looking forward to the opera browser for the DS Which I've been waiting for on a daily basis and it's not here yet.

198
00:12:26,601 --> 00:12:31,740
Scott: I don't really need that cuz I'm getting a new phone soon and phone opera for phones is free and awesome.

199
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:32,965
Scott: I have it on my blackberry.

200
00:12:33,025 --> 00:12:37,020
Rym: I don't see myself getting a good phone anytime in the next three four or five years.

201
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:45,571
Scott: You know, honestly, I would just get a non, you know PDA phone and non smartphone Except I don't want to carry two things around anymore.

202
00:12:45,912 --> 00:12:47,698
Rym: So I carry my DS anyway.

203
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:51,419
Scott: Yeah I don't actually carry my DS unless I have my backpack with.

204
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,633
Rym: well I always carry my my phone because I play games a lot.

205
00:12:54,693 --> 00:12:56,320
Rym: So when I'm sitting around I have nothing to do.

206
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,123
Rym: I play video games.

207
00:12:57,284 --> 00:13:03,331
Rym: Yeah, my DS is only in my backpack for less frequent use plus I got a bunch of new DS games to play.

208
00:13:03,794 --> 00:13:04,116
Scott: you did.

209
00:13:04,136 --> 00:13:04,720
Scott: That's right.

210
00:13:04,921 --> 00:13:06,612
Scott: Yeah, I still have to go to the store and get the medals.

211
00:13:06,632 --> 00:13:07,276
Scott: Like what the hell?

212
00:13:07,739 --> 00:13:13,800
Rym: Yeah I'll have words about portrait of ruin in the coming weeks after I beat it and then I'll have to play it I guess.

213
00:13:14,522 --> 00:13:15,745
Rym: Yeah, I like it.

214
00:13:16,387 --> 00:13:19,898
Rym: a lot of internet people have expressed somewhat negative opinions like them.

215
00:13:19,938 --> 00:13:20,580
Scott: Castlevania's.

216
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,040
Rym: Yeah, I like a mocha.

217
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:28,224
Rym: The thing is I like what new Castlevania's are but I don't like them as much as I liked old Castlevania's.

218
00:13:28,384 --> 00:13:29,229
Scott: Castlevania one.

219
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,460
Rym: now Castlevania one was kind of a shit.

220
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,223
Rym: It's anyone.

221
00:13:32,685 --> 00:13:39,354
Scott: my favorite Castlevania ever is still - my second actually, you know I like Castlevania one the most just because the way it is.

222
00:13:39,495 --> 00:13:43,555
Scott: but to be honest I think super Castlevania Castlevania 4 is the best one.

223
00:13:43,695 --> 00:13:44,198
Rym: It was alright.

224
00:13:44,238 --> 00:13:44,560
Rym: I liked it.

225
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,309
Scott: Okay, and of course everyone is going.

226
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,300
Scott: what the fuck's wrong with you Symphony of the night.

227
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:54,990
Rym: What the fuck you realize when Symphony that came out is when people like us had abandoned console gaming forever as far as we were concerned.

228
00:13:55,092 --> 00:14:02,319
Scott: yeah Symphony night is the first one that is like the ones we're playing now and the GBA and the DS, you know.

229
00:14:03,321 --> 00:14:04,406
Scott: But hey, what you can do?

230
00:14:04,888 --> 00:14:07,499
Rym: Well, I'm gonna keep playing Castlevania until I kill Dracula again.

231
00:14:08,122 --> 00:14:09,770
Scott: Are you sure it's Dracula this time?

232
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,498
Rym: they keep talking about Dracula.

233
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:20,111
Rym: so far there's these vampire girls and there's death and death comes back and he's like I Served Dracula and the young.

234
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,059
Scott: why would death the grim?

235
00:14:23,081 --> 00:14:27,056
Scott: ripa serve Dracula who seems so much lesser than death.

236
00:14:27,981 --> 00:14:28,121
Scott: It's.

237
00:14:28,181 --> 00:14:31,491
Rym: you realize that Dracula is not just Dracula the vampire in these games.

238
00:14:31,551 --> 00:14:34,880
Rym: Dracula is the embodiment of all that is black and evil.

239
00:14:34,981 --> 00:14:36,873
Rym: He is the Dark Lord.

240
00:14:37,114 --> 00:14:42,253
Rym: The way you can look at it Is that Dracula was the last Dark Lord to be around.

241
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,440
Rym: or the Dark Lord essence took over?

242
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,824
Rym: Dracula or something like that.

243
00:14:46,245 --> 00:14:53,187
Rym: and whenever bad things are about to go down Dracula's castle suddenly reappears and then Some I know Satan there's.

244
00:14:53,247 --> 00:14:55,535
Scott: no there's no one worse than Dracula.

245
00:14:56,116 --> 00:14:57,220
Scott: There's no Cthulhu.

246
00:14:57,903 --> 00:15:01,658
Rym: No, pretty much in you played a dawn of sorrow.

247
00:15:02,422 --> 00:15:03,206
Rym: There's that one guy.

248
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,155
Scott: yeah, whatever.

249
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:08,007
Rym: no not Aria of Dawn yet DS.

250
00:15:08,469 --> 00:15:08,770
Scott: Yeah DS.

251
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,335
Rym: I don't know where you get a from.

252
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,038
Scott: That's right.

253
00:15:11,058 --> 00:15:19,593
Rym: Yeah We're uh that guy that who comes right away One of the sub bosses summons Cthulhu and then kills him pretty much right there.

254
00:15:19,694 --> 00:15:22,407
Rym: then Cthulhu is just this minor monster you run Into all the time.

255
00:15:22,427 --> 00:15:26,155
Rym: Yep, so It's pretty much Dracula's.

256
00:15:26,236 --> 00:15:32,940
Rym: it Makes no sense, but it's funny cuz that you've run into death and the main character guy is like, oh shit, it's death.

257
00:15:33,523 --> 00:15:34,549
Rym: We're gonna have to fight him.

258
00:15:34,609 --> 00:15:42,740
Rym: and deaths like I'll kick your ass Nub and then deaths like blah blah blah Dracula and the kids goes but Dracula's not here.

259
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:48,139
Rym: This other guys in charge of Dracula's castle and deaths like what I think I've been asleep too long ever go look into this.

260
00:15:49,543 --> 00:15:51,212
Rym: So I'm waiting to see what happens with all that.

261
00:15:51,232 --> 00:15:52,600
Rym: I haven't gotten very far in the game yet.

262
00:15:52,801 --> 00:15:54,679
Scott: You know who's in charge of Dracula's castle?

263
00:15:55,302 --> 00:15:58,833
Scott: Dracul or Drakk or Alucard.

264
00:15:58,954 --> 00:16:00,238
Rym: Alucard is my man.

265
00:16:00,338 --> 00:16:02,025
Scott: All right All right.

266
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:15,547
Rym: So in the much more stupid news there's been the whole issue with people breaking the straps on their remotes, which I will sum up simply as if you ever Break the strap on your remote.

267
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:19,440
Rym: You are not using your remote properly.

268
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,248
Scott: There's a video of a guy who adds what.

269
00:16:22,288 --> 00:16:29,099
Scott: he takes a wiimote strap and he puts weights on it until it breaks and he Basically couldn't break it with a lot of weight and baby.

270
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:37,298
Scott: He tried to swing it and let go of it on purpose until the strap broke He had to swing it so monstrously hard for it to break.

271
00:16:37,438 --> 00:16:39,203
Rym: good god now not one.

272
00:16:39,564 --> 00:16:46,437
Rym: the worst thing is that people seem to be using like letting go of the wiimote on purpose because they seem to think that that's what the wrist strap is for.

273
00:16:46,457 --> 00:16:49,327
Rym: and No, the wrist strap is for.

274
00:16:49,447 --> 00:16:59,340
Rym: if you on occasion like once every five years Happen to drop your wiimote and even then if you drop your remote, you're just as stupid.

275
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:03,659
Rym: How could you possibly let go of a video game controller while you're using it?

276
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,557
Scott: He just ate some fried chicken, but did you?

277
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:15,232
Rym: Realize that if one of my friends came over when I was a kid and his hands were greasy and he even looked like he Was gonna get near one of my controllers.

278
00:17:15,252 --> 00:17:16,398
Rym: I would beat him.

279
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,608
Scott: Yep, those people are disgusting those people.

280
00:17:19,907 --> 00:17:25,525
Rym: anyone who came near me with greasy hands if I had something like a video game would Be kicked out of my house.

281
00:17:25,746 --> 00:17:25,906
Scott: Yep.

282
00:17:25,925 --> 00:17:28,276
Rym: In fact, I did kick a kid out of my house once.

283
00:17:28,537 --> 00:17:30,766
Rym: cuz he I caught him playing My Nintendo with greasy fingers.

284
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:36,497
Rym: Oh, I washed that thing with alcohol And as a result ruined it.

285
00:17:39,948 --> 00:17:51,514
Rym: But no Not Nintendo, you know is doing the right thing and by the right thing meaning the good PR thing and they're allowing anyone Who feels they have a concern to ask for a stronger we strap.

286
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:53,259
Scott: you can get from one to four?

287
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,706
Scott: Replacement stronger we straps.

288
00:17:56,027 --> 00:17:58,796
Scott: I think I'm gonna ask for him cuz hey free we straps.

289
00:17:58,816 --> 00:17:59,117
Scott: Why not?

290
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:00,240
Rym: See the thing is one.

291
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:07,371
Rym: I'm thinking of taking the we strap off of my wiimote and putting it on my DS And then I'm not gonna have a strap on my wiimote.

292
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:10,160
Rym: cuz I'm I have manual dexterity.

293
00:18:10,584 --> 00:18:12,359
Rym: My Dex is higher than seven.

294
00:18:13,103 --> 00:18:14,367
Rym: I won't drop the wiimote.

295
00:18:14,608 --> 00:18:22,194
Scott: see the only reason I don't do that is because I actually you know Regardless of the protection the we strap provides I kind of like how it feels.

296
00:18:22,395 --> 00:18:28,940
Rym: it only feels good to me Because if I don't put it on I've got this strap hanging or hanging down even it.

297
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,460
Scott: No, even if I took the strap off, I still feel like it's kind of like getting in the car without a seatbelt.

298
00:18:33,865 --> 00:18:34,900
Scott: You know, it doesn't feel right.

299
00:18:35,061 --> 00:18:44,426
Scott: Even if the car didn't beep at you and say hey put your fucking car My car if you don't put the seatbelt on it's like hey put your fucking seatbelt on bitch Like.

300
00:18:44,466 --> 00:18:45,840
Scott: I took it off for a second one.

301
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:57,111
Scott: So I was driving to you know to do to reach over and grab something and it was like, oh my god Oh my god, beep beep beep beep beep and like shut the fuck up car I'm putting it back on.

302
00:18:57,433 --> 00:19:04,420
Scott: god damn it No, but Even if I take the the we strap off the remote.

303
00:19:04,582 --> 00:19:06,220
Scott: It still feels like I'm not wearing my seatbelt.

304
00:19:06,701 --> 00:19:07,905
Rym: See you could have the same.

305
00:19:07,945 --> 00:19:12,299
Rym: get one of those Lance Armstrong fan things stick it around your wrist and then go.

306
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:13,805
Scott: That would probably work.

307
00:19:13,865 --> 00:19:14,970
Scott: But why bother?

308
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:15,673
Scott: it's so much easier.

309
00:19:15,693 --> 00:19:17,480
Scott: Just use the stupid strap, which is already there.

310
00:19:17,821 --> 00:19:20,672
Rym: No, cuz every time you want to pick up the controller, you got to put that strap on.

311
00:19:21,174 --> 00:19:21,656
Scott: that's fine.

312
00:19:21,676 --> 00:19:28,380
Rym: Ah I like to plop down and immediately game and then when I'm done gaming I immediately stand up and hit power.

313
00:19:28,561 --> 00:19:31,012
Scott: It doesn't take me that long to do it.

314
00:19:31,072 --> 00:19:31,976
Rym: Hey, that's eight seconds.

315
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:33,584
Rym: You're never getting back It's not a.

316
00:19:33,664 --> 00:19:34,830
Scott: it doesn't even take eight seconds.

317
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:45,029
Rym: You can't take eight seconds things of the day.

318
00:19:45,592 --> 00:19:51,913
Rym: But before the things the day I got a little overzealous there and queued up the things the day before I actually talked about The news.

319
00:19:52,214 --> 00:19:52,856
Scott: good job.

320
00:19:53,297 --> 00:19:54,080
Rym: So the real.

321
00:19:54,100 --> 00:20:11,970
Rym: briefly the news is that green welling LLP has filed a class-action lawsuit against Nintendo over the quote-unquote faulty we straps and the Injuries they have caused and the property damage they have caused and how it's so negligent of Nintendo.

322
00:20:13,357 --> 00:20:14,325
Scott: I think they're gonna lose.

323
00:20:14,406 --> 00:20:22,594
Rym: end of story Maybe one the fact that Nintendo warns every step of the way any time you try to do anything with the weeds It reminds you.

324
00:20:22,614 --> 00:20:24,922
Rym: Hey, don't forget to put the thing on.

325
00:20:25,243 --> 00:20:25,966
Rym: be careful.

326
00:20:26,307 --> 00:20:26,930
Rym: Don't drop it.

327
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:31,223
Scott: Yeah, they pretty much done everything they possibly can to avoid any sort of lawsuit.

328
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:36,650
Scott: These guys are just walking into a death trap a Legal death trap if you will.

329
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,638
Rym: Yeah, I mean Nintendo doesn't dick around.

330
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:47,680
Rym: when people forget that back in the day Nintendo was on the receiving end of a very massive Antitrust they were also first they were on the giving end.

331
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:54,310
Scott: Nintendo basically got ahead by a lawsuit And then they got on the receiving end of a lawsuit.

332
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:58,870
Rym: Yeah, people always forget that there was a time when Nintendo was a monopoly.

333
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:02,647
Rym: They were considered a video game monopoly and the government was trying to break them up.

334
00:21:02,949 --> 00:21:12,409
Rym: Yep But yeah, this company has no chance and the fact that the picture here on Kotaku is a Phoenix Wright says it all.

335
00:21:13,254 --> 00:21:15,709
Rym: Yeah, anyway back to things of the day.

336
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,159
Rym: Once again, I have a very simple one.

337
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:22,175
Rym: There's not much that can be said about it Other than that.

338
00:21:22,235 --> 00:21:24,907
Rym: the title here is the piddler on the roof.

339
00:21:25,489 --> 00:21:31,749
Rym: now This does not refer to the opening scene of rainy dog Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

340
00:21:33,633 --> 00:21:39,492
Rym: See now if you'd come up with funny lyrics that involved pee then that would have been gold Too late.

341
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:40,615
Rym: the moment's gone.

342
00:21:40,755 --> 00:21:42,499
Rym: Okay, so the.

343
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,803
Rym: I think I'll have to read the.

344
00:21:43,963 --> 00:21:53,950
Rym: I mean the the fact that these kids put a Penis, they drew a penis on the roof of a school which was then captured from space by satellites and is now on the internet.

345
00:21:54,718 --> 00:22:06,460
Rym: Clearly visible Heroes, they are yes gods among men, but the caption on this picture is balls up Willy-on-roof of posh yarn school as seen from space.

346
00:22:07,151 --> 00:22:08,335
Scott: Did did someone like?

347
00:22:08,556 --> 00:22:09,038
Scott: I don't know.

348
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,630
Scott: did the school dress up as a DS for Halloween or something?

349
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:13,773
Scott: What happened?

350
00:22:14,235 --> 00:22:15,179
Rym: just the fact that?

351
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,195
Rym: Think about the society that we live in.

352
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:33,798
Rym: you were all listening to a podcast and we're all talking about or you're listening to us talk about the fact that somewhere in the world a bunch of people much like us drew a giant member on top of a School a member that was then seen from space.

353
00:22:34,139 --> 00:22:42,909
Rym: that picture was then beamed back to the earth where people like us can watch it View it a comment on it talk about it and save it forever and laugh at it.

354
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:47,223
Rym: We are gods compared to the vast majority of human history.

355
00:22:47,544 --> 00:22:54,750
Rym: if this is what we do with our lives Yeah, I mean try explaining what we were doing right now to someone from ancient Greece.

356
00:22:55,533 --> 00:22:59,489
Rym: Yes, you see that you know that penis that those kids drew on top of the Parthenon.

357
00:23:04,212 --> 00:23:06,190
Rym: Here's a picture of it from space.

358
00:23:11,677 --> 00:23:19,570
Rym: So anyway Now the best part of this is that was not the only member that these kids put up during the weekend.

359
00:23:20,371 --> 00:23:26,560
Rym: To quote the article they managed to get on the roof of the friary building and somehow mark on the Willy.

360
00:23:27,475 --> 00:23:28,270
Rym: they also.

361
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:36,689
Rym: They also burnt a manhood into the grass.

362
00:23:37,615 --> 00:23:39,790
Rym: That is a quote that is verbatim from the article.

363
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:59,161
Rym: They burnt a manhood onto the grass Right, so Maybe that's how those Greek statues?

364
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:01,230
Scott: it was just punk kids.

365
00:24:02,735 --> 00:24:15,290
Scott: They attached them on with clay Pictures of them from space And then they snuck him into museums and fooled everyone to think of their works of art.

366
00:24:15,893 --> 00:24:19,110
Rym: See people always thought that Zeus would come down and yell at people or seduce women.

367
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:24,970
Rym: No, Zeus was coming down to tell the parents of kids that he had to deal with the fact that they're growing penises on every.

368
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,790
Scott: Yeah, cuz we do some fucking Mount Olympus.

369
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,941
Scott: He looks down on the city and he says what the hell is that?

370
00:24:30,342 --> 00:24:32,590
Scott: So what drew a fucking penis on the top roof?

371
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:33,306
Scott: What the hell?

372
00:24:36,116 --> 00:24:36,625
Scott: They do that.

373
00:24:38,432 --> 00:24:39,555
Scott: It was that you Hermes.

374
00:24:39,957 --> 00:24:43,086
Rym: I think you're forgetting that they also burnt a manhood into the grass.

375
00:24:43,126 --> 00:24:45,327
Rym: now Zeus could take care of that easily with his lightning.

376
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:58,337
Scott: Now I think you're thinking today's gonna pale in comparison but come on out alright, so my thing today is a short video from a Japanese TV show.

377
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:07,149
Scott: Oh, we we oh, we we called Sanma palace and I don't know what the hell this shows about and the clip is very short.

378
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:15,823
Scott: but in the clip they talk to voice actress Ikue Ohtani who is the voice of Pikachu.

379
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,031
Rym: now I Mean.

380
00:25:18,071 --> 00:25:27,349
Rym: we all are aware on an intellectual level that there aren't Pokemon and that when you hear a Pokemon talking It is actually a human being talking into a microphone.

381
00:25:27,933 --> 00:25:28,980
Rym: But seeing is done.

382
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,733
Rym: live by a real human Borders.

383
00:25:31,874 --> 00:25:32,736
Rym: on the frightening.

384
00:25:32,756 --> 00:25:37,570
Scott: I mean, it's one thing to see someone at a convention come up to you and go pick up a guy.

385
00:25:37,851 --> 00:25:43,488
Scott: It's like alright, the person said Pika Pika to hear someone say Pika Pika.

386
00:25:43,548 --> 00:25:47,127
Scott: the way Pikachu says Pika Pika.

387
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:50,337
Scott: Exactly the way like that's it.

388
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:52,553
Scott: She she is Pikachu.

389
00:25:52,654 --> 00:25:54,361
Scott: it's like oh, oh god.

390
00:25:54,562 --> 00:25:58,509
Scott: It's it's like lightning in the brain now Burning a member on your front lawn.

391
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:04,869
Rym: Now I gave Scott a list of the other roles that this woman has had.

392
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:08,095
Scott: Well, there are really only two of them that are interesting.

393
00:26:08,155 --> 00:26:10,539
Scott: First of all, well Pikachu Pikachu.

394
00:26:10,739 --> 00:26:19,522
Scott: second of all Not only is she Pikachu she's Pikachu and everywhere Pikachu appears including Puzzle League.

395
00:26:19,862 --> 00:26:21,865
Scott: She's Pikachu and Pokemon pinball.

396
00:26:22,266 --> 00:26:23,868
Scott: She's Pikachu and Smash Brothers.

397
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:24,790
Scott: She's Pikachu.

398
00:26:25,472 --> 00:26:27,036
Scott: Anywhere Pikachu's voice appears.

399
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,162
Scott: this lady did it now.

400
00:26:29,904 --> 00:26:32,030
Scott: you might know the cartoon Animaniacs.

401
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:39,057
Scott: Well, it aired in Japan and dot Warner was voiced by the same lady who did Pikachu.

402
00:26:39,478 --> 00:26:45,689
Rym: not only that but then the Japanese dub of Full house.

403
00:26:46,532 --> 00:26:47,736
Scott: Yes full house.

404
00:26:48,098 --> 00:26:50,224
Scott: Yes the same that she saw.

405
00:26:50,265 --> 00:26:51,769
Rym: the very same.

406
00:26:55,397 --> 00:26:55,867
Scott: Who was she?

407
00:26:57,233 --> 00:26:57,778
Rym: Some care.

408
00:26:57,798 --> 00:26:58,122
Rym: I don't know.

409
00:26:58,142 --> 00:26:58,728
Rym: I hated that show.

410
00:27:00,113 --> 00:27:00,935
Rym: I used to watch it.

411
00:27:01,817 --> 00:27:02,499
Rym: I don't know why.

412
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:05,567
Rym: I really don't know why she was Stephanie Tanner.

413
00:27:06,289 --> 00:27:07,472
Rym: to this day I think back.

414
00:27:07,613 --> 00:27:09,860
Rym: I remember the times when I'd watch full house.

415
00:27:10,202 --> 00:27:11,366
Scott: I never actually watched full house.

416
00:27:11,406 --> 00:27:12,489
Scott: I watched the shows after it.

417
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:17,130
Rym: now I'll say this that I can't register any emotion from that period in my life.

418
00:27:17,371 --> 00:27:22,550
Scott: I remember the closer full house because I turned on the TV as the closer was going and I would watch the shows that followed.

419
00:27:23,052 --> 00:27:27,150
Rym: I remember watching that other thing where Bob Saget and the other guy that I would say cut it out.

420
00:27:28,092 --> 00:27:28,555
Scott: What was that?

421
00:27:28,575 --> 00:27:29,500
Scott: I have no idea.

422
00:27:29,862 --> 00:27:30,285
Rym: cuz I've done.

423
00:27:30,305 --> 00:27:31,110
Rym: I'm doing it right now cut.

424
00:27:31,211 --> 00:27:32,477
Scott: I know you're always doing.

425
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:42,750
Rym: I'm doing that all the time cuz I when I was a little kid I practiced hard until I could do it without thinking because it's it's a simple thing to do But it's kind of like a magic spell you got to be able to move your fingers just right or loses the effects.

426
00:27:43,271 --> 00:27:46,762
Rym: Yeah, but of course the effect is getting myself beat up.

427
00:27:47,063 --> 00:27:49,490
Scott: Yeah, so what's the show about today?

428
00:27:49,690 --> 00:28:01,229
Rym: Well after killing all that time talking about penises penis on the parthenon good guy, yeah We decided we talked a little bit about board games.

429
00:28:01,891 --> 00:28:02,776
Scott: It's been a while.

430
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:03,681
Scott: It has been a while.

431
00:28:03,721 --> 00:28:05,290
Scott: We haven't played too many board games lately.

432
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:09,575
Scott: At least we haven't played any new ones even though Here's something for everybody.

433
00:28:09,676 --> 00:28:12,388
Scott: I discovered a video podcast called board games with Scott.

434
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,839
Scott: now I had heard of it and it's not me Scott.

435
00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:21,310
Scott: It's some other guy named Scott who's a little bit nerdy, but he's cool And I heard of this thing before but never went to watch it.

436
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,259
Scott: I actually thought it was an audio podcast.

437
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:25,450
Scott: So I just kind of you know, I didn't have time for it.

438
00:28:25,931 --> 00:28:37,021
Scott: It's actually a video podcast and the guy takes board games out and teaches you the rules and everything and it's pretty cool Like to go there and see some of these games that he demonstrates.

439
00:28:37,302 --> 00:28:46,212
Scott: like if you think die mocker is complicated Go watch this guy named Scott demonstrate and you'll still think it's complicated because that game is Complicated.

440
00:28:46,293 --> 00:28:54,536
Scott: Yeah, but he does a lot of like really new games that you probably can't get yet very easily unless you're all savvy Buying it online or anything like that.

441
00:28:54,616 --> 00:28:59,110
Scott: So it's cool to see how these games work step by step and everything.

442
00:28:59,674 --> 00:29:01,688
Scott: So board games of Scott go check it out.

443
00:29:02,071 --> 00:29:06,971
Rym: Yeah, but see once the Wii came out pretty much we were playing Resident Evil 4.

444
00:29:06,971 --> 00:29:10,530
Scott: I say press a and I beat it the day before the Wii came out.

445
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,724
Scott: I mean if I didn't beat it before the Wii came out.

446
00:29:12,764 --> 00:29:19,290
Rym: I was never gonna beat it Crammed in as much board gaming and video gaming as we could in knowing that a moment that we came out.

447
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:19,953
Rym: That was the end.

448
00:29:20,234 --> 00:29:21,822
Rym: It was the end and it was the end.

449
00:29:21,983 --> 00:29:23,410
Scott: We don't even really watch Netflix enough.

450
00:29:23,731 --> 00:29:31,969
Rym: We don't do anything now until now that the Wii is awesome still but it's not the ever present driving force in our lives every waking moment.

451
00:29:32,811 --> 00:29:40,649
Rym: We've started doing other things and this weekend when we plan to work on the show We were because we got all that swag and swag coming and we were gonna work on it.

452
00:29:41,091 --> 00:29:46,770
Rym: But then Alex came over and instead of doing that we played Puerto Rico and then we played Calus twice.

453
00:29:47,293 --> 00:29:50,430
Scott: Yeah, and those are all games that we've played and talked about before.

454
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:57,016
Rym: Yeah, Puerto Rico and Calus are hard board games as in real deal Completely, uh, I don't know.

455
00:29:57,056 --> 00:29:58,221
Scott: Those are man's games.

456
00:29:58,262 --> 00:30:00,150
Scott: It's sort of like if you want to read gecky gum.

457
00:30:00,271 --> 00:30:07,187
Rym: Oh, no, we're not talking man in like the sexist man versus woman We're talking man in the gecky guy ho Joe standing there with a gun.

458
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:16,247
Scott: exactly I mean a woman can be that manly that got manga gecky guy is to manga as These board games are to other board games.

459
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:21,976
Rym: Yeah Yeah, I mean it's a woman can be just as manly as a man when it comes to that It has nothing to do with gender.

460
00:30:22,077 --> 00:30:24,167
Rym: It is a special use of the word man.

461
00:30:24,368 --> 00:30:29,885
Rym: Yes Anyway, now I would like to mention the fact just it's masculine.

462
00:30:29,925 --> 00:30:30,367
Scott: How's that?

463
00:30:30,849 --> 00:30:37,235
Scott: But that Specifically Okay, and I'm silly.

464
00:30:37,275 --> 00:30:41,330
Rym: well regardless of all that I'll note that I won every single game we played that weekend.

465
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:41,933
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

466
00:30:42,315 --> 00:30:45,050
Rym: Yeah, I just had to bring that up because Scott talked to big seat.

467
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:51,169
Rym: It's no big deal to win a board game because everyone in the crew was really smart and when we play board games It's always a really tough fight.

468
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:56,250
Rym: But I won the first game of Calus by a bit and Scott was like I'll win next time.

469
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,676
Rym: I was distracted blah blah blah.

470
00:30:57,717 --> 00:31:08,392
Scott: I lost terribly because in the early turns I hadn't played Calus in a while I had forgotten most of the rules and some very important rules and I screwed up now big time Despite

471
00:31:08,452 --> 00:31:18,110
Rym: the fact that Alex who is play until this weekend had played Calus twice in his life Remembered every single rule and did fine if I did better than Scott.

472
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,726
Scott: Well, cuz uh, he remembered all the rules and I didn't.

473
00:31:21,169 --> 00:31:23,578
Rym: well I don't know you I don't know how you didn't.

474
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:25,243
Rym: wasn't that you were forgotten rules.

475
00:31:25,303 --> 00:31:27,150
Scott: I remember should I did yesterday?

476
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,215
Rym: But That's irrelevant.

477
00:31:30,235 --> 00:31:34,210
Rym: I was just bragging because I won these games and in our crew that that means a lot.

478
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,413
Rym: Yeah next weekend.

479
00:31:35,434 --> 00:31:36,617
Rym: I'll probably lose every game.

480
00:31:36,838 --> 00:31:41,794
Scott: Anyway, today we're gonna talk about what makes a board game Good.

481
00:31:41,814 --> 00:31:42,235
Rym: Yeah.

482
00:31:42,316 --> 00:31:59,070
Rym: I mean we own a lot of board games and we have played a Freaking lot of board games, but despite owning all these games all of which we enjoyed when we played them There's only a select handful that have staying power that we continue to play on a regular basis without ever growing tired of them.

483
00:31:59,511 --> 00:32:05,748
Scott: Mm-hmm, and you know, once you play a lot of board games in most people you just play Monopoly Scrabble.

484
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:09,710
Scott: Sorry Whatever, you know, it's something to do to pass the time with friends.

485
00:32:10,211 --> 00:32:18,028
Scott: It's really just sort of like, you know something to do with your hands while you have conversation and drink or whatever You're doing or hang out with your family.

486
00:32:19,113 --> 00:32:25,069
Scott: When you play board games for the sake of playing them you begin to notice a few things You know like huh?

487
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:35,428
Scott: That board game won't be fun to ever play again because of X Y & Z or this board game will always be fun Or that one's not fun, but it's a damn good game, etc, etc.

488
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:36,793
Rym: So I guess.

489
00:32:36,813 --> 00:32:46,804
Rym: hence the best way to categorize this is simply that when we talk about board games being good There are really two completely distinct but non mutually exclusive categories.

490
00:32:47,185 --> 00:33:00,630
Rym: to break things down into very simple terms There are games that are pure and good that are purely good games that they are on some abstract or real level a Very well constructed game that covered all the bases

491
00:33:01,092 --> 00:33:05,027
Scott: Yeah, we're only talking about the rules here not like the pieces and then all that stuff.

492
00:33:05,047 --> 00:33:05,910
Rym: That's none of that matter.

493
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:12,287
Rym: We're talking about the actual raw game mechanics Yes, and on the opposite end of the spectrum there are games that are fun.

494
00:33:12,307 --> 00:33:15,197
Rym: now I said that these are not mutually exclusive.

495
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:18,890
Rym: There are games that are not good games that are incredibly fun.

496
00:33:19,513 --> 00:33:25,340
Rym: There are games that are not fun at all that are very good games Yeah, and there are games that are good and fun.

497
00:33:25,441 --> 00:33:27,710
Scott: and there are games that are not good and not fun.

498
00:33:28,212 --> 00:33:33,110
Scott: You can mix it up any way you want because totally different factors influence each thing.

499
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:43,250
Scott: However, if you are like us and you are the kind of person who enjoys a good game Then good games will be at least a little fun, even though they can also be terrible.

500
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:53,739
Rym: Yep And the best way to know if a game is good because you can't really know upon first playings or even a bunch of playings Any game how good it truly is in terms of staying power.

501
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:58,968
Rym: because almost any board game no matter how bad it is is Fun at least once or twice.

502
00:33:59,491 --> 00:34:10,630
Scott: Well, the reason a board game is fun at least once is because I think personally it's fun to read the rules and to Look at all these new pieces and boards and to see how they work.

503
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:16,425
Scott: Just seeing a new game unfold and learning about it and opening the box and whatever.

504
00:34:16,705 --> 00:34:18,429
Scott: that in itself is fun for me.

505
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:23,010
Scott: So any board game in the world has that amount of fun in it already?

506
00:34:23,551 --> 00:34:25,232
Rym: I mean that moment Like

507
00:34:25,292 --> 00:34:25,934
Scott: even Hellas

508
00:34:26,014 --> 00:34:39,918
Rym: like any complex game where you're reading through the rules and it's tough and you're not understand and then There's always that moment of revelation in a complex game where it clicks and like you will learn about one more game mechanic and suddenly You understand on a high level how the game works.

509
00:34:40,339 --> 00:34:52,185
Rym: Like oh, it's a bidding game or oh It's a cube manipulation game or like oh, it's that kind of game and that all those moments really They're good experience.

510
00:34:52,568 --> 00:34:57,770
Rym: Yep I think just as important is that the first few times you play a game It's a novel experience.

511
00:34:57,991 --> 00:35:02,327
Rym: Everyone's on equal playing field usually because no one else has played the game before and that's you're having.

512
00:35:02,388 --> 00:35:04,189
Scott: someone who's mad Experience teach you the game.

513
00:35:04,391 --> 00:35:05,615
Rym: Yeah, but then they get the own.

514
00:35:05,635 --> 00:35:09,429
Rym: they get their own unique experience of watching people who have never played the game before play it.

515
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:13,927
Rym: Yep, but just any game or how bad it is is always novel.

516
00:35:13,967 --> 00:35:16,209
Rym: the first time you played You don't know what strategy is gonna win.

517
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:25,489
Scott: I mean if you've never played problematic trouble before it's fun to hit that problematic bubble in the middle Especially when you figure out how to make it always give you a six, especially when you're three years old.

518
00:35:26,233 --> 00:35:27,221
Scott: And to be green.

519
00:35:27,483 --> 00:35:31,470
Rym: see when I was a little kid I always thought that headache was a much better game than trouble.

520
00:35:31,731 --> 00:35:32,617
Scott: I know what headache is.

521
00:35:32,778 --> 00:35:39,610
Rym: headache was the one that looked very much like trouble But you had little coney guys instead and you could like capture other people's coney guys by jumping on top of them.

522
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:40,996
Scott: And okay, we always.

523
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:42,944
Scott: we usually played sorry more than we played trouble.

524
00:35:42,984 --> 00:35:44,149
Scott: just because our trouble sucked.

525
00:35:45,152 --> 00:35:45,797
Rym: I used to complain.

526
00:35:45,817 --> 00:35:52,443
Rym: my family always wanted to play a sorry But they get mad if I played optimally like I played.

527
00:35:52,503 --> 00:35:53,325
Scott: sorry optimally.

528
00:35:53,466 --> 00:35:54,067
Scott: everyone played.

529
00:35:54,128 --> 00:35:58,470
Scott: sorry optimally No, but I didn't get on those sliders knocking each other off the board.

530
00:35:58,671 --> 00:35:59,293
Scott: It was crazy.

531
00:35:59,313 --> 00:36:03,868
Rym: if I was in second place and I use my sorry troubles to screw over like my dad.

532
00:36:03,888 --> 00:36:09,587
Rym: if he was winning My family would be all like hey, you're just preventing him from winning so you can win.

533
00:36:09,627 --> 00:36:13,155
Rym: and I'm like Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

534
00:36:13,235 --> 00:36:14,098
Scott: That's the point.

535
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:16,727
Scott: Yeah, I'm just supposed to play randomly.

536
00:36:16,747 --> 00:36:17,389
Scott: then what's the point?

537
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:19,315
Rym: Okay Luke always made that argument.

538
00:36:19,696 --> 00:36:21,642
Scott: Well, that's just cuz he wanted to win.

539
00:36:22,204 --> 00:36:23,950
Scott: sure that was part of his way of winning.

540
00:36:24,251 --> 00:36:28,450
Scott: Yeah was to act like he wasn't trying to win and convince you not to try to win.

541
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:30,678
Scott: Therefore he would win cuz he had the only one trying.

542
00:36:30,799 --> 00:36:34,335
Rym: my strategies are much more devious and I tricked other people much more subtle Yeah.

543
00:36:34,436 --> 00:36:34,639
Scott: Yeah.

544
00:36:34,781 --> 00:36:38,967
Rym: Yeah anyway Forgot where I was going with that train of thought so I'll just continue.

545
00:36:39,229 --> 00:36:46,697
Rym: Yep But once you've played a game a bunch of times and you figured out all the games basic tricks Like you become an intermediate player of the game.

546
00:36:46,717 --> 00:36:47,700
Rym: You're no longer beginner.

547
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,670
Rym: You're no longer learning about the game on any fundamental level.

548
00:36:51,294 --> 00:36:56,290
Rym: That's the point in which you can judge if a game is truly good or not Because that's the point where you realize like you can visualize.

549
00:36:56,951 --> 00:37:00,470
Rym: Would this game still be fun if I figure out the number of bids?

550
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:04,509
Rym: I should make in the first round because once I figure that out, maybe there's no game anymore.

551
00:37:05,892 --> 00:37:10,316
Scott: Well, there's some good examples for Puerto Rico, which you just talked about right?

552
00:37:10,336 --> 00:37:12,463
Scott: We've played that game a hundred times, right?

553
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:13,286
Rym: Probably more than that.

554
00:37:13,487 --> 00:37:17,601
Scott: Yeah, and You know every turn you have to make some decisions.

555
00:37:17,701 --> 00:37:19,066
Scott: cuz they're really there's nothing in the game.

556
00:37:19,086 --> 00:37:20,250
Scott: There's no dice or anything.

557
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,214
Scott: It's decisions.

558
00:37:21,415 --> 00:37:22,620
Scott: All you do is make decisions.

559
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,668
Rym: Yeah, I mean literally nothing is random in that game.

560
00:37:24,768 --> 00:37:29,430
Scott: Nope and Every get time you play the game you have to make these same decisions.

561
00:37:29,611 --> 00:37:32,684
Scott: but I've played the game at least 50 to 100 times.

562
00:37:32,744 --> 00:37:37,441
Scott: I don't even freaking know anymore and Making the decisions doesn't get any easier.

563
00:37:37,502 --> 00:37:38,969
Scott: I don't just know the answers.

564
00:37:39,231 --> 00:37:41,544
Scott: You know, I mean if you played what was that game?

565
00:37:41,584 --> 00:37:42,429
Scott: We played Timbuktu.

566
00:37:42,911 --> 00:37:50,821
Scott: Yeah, Timbuktu if you play that game once and you're an intelligent human being if you play it again You know exactly what move to make.

567
00:37:50,841 --> 00:37:52,510
Scott: you don't even have to think about it.

568
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:58,470
Scott: You just know because it's like solving a crossword puzzle and then doing the same crossword puzzle again.

569
00:37:58,891 --> 00:38:00,296
Scott: You know the answer already.

570
00:38:00,597 --> 00:38:01,541
Scott: It's not fun anymore.

571
00:38:01,681 --> 00:38:01,862
Rym: Yep.

572
00:38:01,922 --> 00:38:10,870
Rym: There are many board games that are solvable Absolutely solvable where if you figure out the game on a fundamental level you have to make zero decisions in the whole game.

573
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:15,650
Rym: You know exactly what to do to either win or to have the absolute best chance of winning.

574
00:38:16,172 --> 00:38:20,669
Scott: Yeah, and when that happens the games not fun anymore, and it's also not good.

575
00:38:21,171 --> 00:38:29,370
Scott: Yep, the best games are games in which no matter how much you know You still have to do thinking in order to win.

576
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:31,616
Scott: I mean, you know some got.

577
00:38:31,696 --> 00:38:42,075
Scott: sometimes the games are such that you could possibly reach that level But it's so complex that it's difficult for a human to do Like chess or Tigers and Euphrates.

578
00:38:42,255 --> 00:38:47,127
Scott: Yeah, but sometimes games is just not possible at all.

579
00:38:47,548 --> 00:38:49,976
Rym: to ever solve it Let's break it down into.

580
00:38:49,996 --> 00:38:57,182
Rym: let's give an example of all the different like we got these four corners here a game That is not good and not fun, which would be Hellas.

581
00:38:57,603 --> 00:38:57,744
Scott: Yep.

582
00:38:58,346 --> 00:38:59,490
Rym: Hellas is not a good game.

583
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:00,795
Rym: It is not a fun game.

584
00:39:01,077 --> 00:39:02,282
Rym: The rules are written poorly.

585
00:39:02,563 --> 00:39:04,050
Rym: The game is basically unplayable.

586
00:39:04,391 --> 00:39:09,790
Rym: We have never played the game without running into an unanswerable rules question that prevented.

587
00:39:10,791 --> 00:39:12,398
Scott: Another example would be monopoly.

588
00:39:12,438 --> 00:39:13,583
Scott: Monopoly is not good.

589
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:15,872
Scott: Whoever wins comes down to dice It.

590
00:39:15,912 --> 00:39:16,694
Scott: why even play?

591
00:39:16,794 --> 00:39:20,886
Scott: and it also not fun because you've got to play forever and it just.

592
00:39:21,107 --> 00:39:22,190
Scott: it doesn't matter anymore.

593
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,769
Rym: See, I will point out monopoly is fun for the first ten minutes.

594
00:39:25,031 --> 00:39:31,942
Rym: Yep, and if you ever play monopoly with your friends ever again I suggest you right now one play by the original rules of the game.

595
00:39:32,343 --> 00:39:32,664
Rym: None of that.

596
00:39:32,684 --> 00:39:35,753
Rym: free parking BS to the Moments.

597
00:39:36,196 --> 00:39:38,630
Rym: the game is not always fun anymore.

598
00:39:38,891 --> 00:39:46,795
Rym: The moment all the property is bought you must immediately knock that board over and run away Possibly screaming while doing so.

599
00:39:47,157 --> 00:39:48,481
Scott: Okay, let's let's have it a game.

600
00:39:48,501 --> 00:39:50,146
Scott: That's fun, but not good.

601
00:39:50,307 --> 00:39:52,414
Rym: I would say Citadel's Citadel's.

602
00:39:52,434 --> 00:39:54,750
Rym: you see Citadel's is an incredibly fun game.

603
00:39:55,051 --> 00:40:02,721
Rym: I absolutely love playing it it but on a fundamental level the Basic tactics of the game break up into two categories.

604
00:40:02,761 --> 00:40:06,976
Rym: The first category is making the Obvious optimal move.

605
00:40:07,578 --> 00:40:12,113
Rym: these you know, but build the right thing do the right thing It's always obvious.

606
00:40:12,655 --> 00:40:18,755
Rym: and the second bit of tactics is very simply the princess bride conundrum Which cup is the poison in?

607
00:40:18,775 --> 00:40:23,430
Rym: and the answer is you can't make a determination so it ends up being totally random.

608
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:28,670
Scott: Well, I was gonna say apples to apples because apples to apples as a game is just completely subjective.

609
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:30,376
Scott: There's not even really a game there.

610
00:40:30,396 --> 00:40:32,482
Scott: Yeah, but terms of fun.

611
00:40:32,783 --> 00:40:34,369
Scott: It's like the most fun you're gonna have.

612
00:40:34,509 --> 00:40:34,810
Rym: I agree.

613
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:38,090
Rym: I think both are good examples of that kind of game a game that is very fun.

614
00:40:38,231 --> 00:40:39,939
Rym: I will play apples to apples anytime.

615
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:40,361
Rym: Mm-hmm.

616
00:40:40,623 --> 00:40:42,010
Rym: I will play Citadel's anytime.

617
00:40:42,211 --> 00:40:44,980
Rym: I love both games, but they are not good games.

618
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:47,086
Rym: They're fun games and I acknowledge this fact.

619
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,210
Scott: All right, what's the game?

620
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:49,936
Scott: That's good, but not fun.

621
00:40:49,956 --> 00:40:53,950
Rym: Uh, I I would I want to say die marker, but I haven't played it enough.

622
00:40:54,291 --> 00:40:56,096
Scott: Yeah, I played enough to know.

623
00:40:56,116 --> 00:41:01,010
Rym: I played it once and I lost and I wasn't entirely sure what happened.

624
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:04,433
Rym: Wow Alex won.

625
00:41:04,473 --> 00:41:06,541
Rym: we're sitting around we're counting up the scores right.

626
00:41:06,561 --> 00:41:08,910
Rym: the game had ended and my brain hurt.

627
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:12,204
Rym: we'd been playing this game for four hours not counting the time.

628
00:41:12,244 --> 00:41:20,834
Rym: it took us to learn how to play and The game ended and then we were reading like we were following the rules and adding up scores and we had no idea Who had won.

629
00:41:21,116 --> 00:41:23,270
Rym: we had no way to know who was even close to winning.

630
00:41:23,735 --> 00:41:29,763
Rym: We just followed this complex Byzantine set of rules at the end of which we determined that Alex was the winner.

631
00:41:30,245 --> 00:41:31,970
Rym: and he said I don't know how I won.

632
00:41:32,372 --> 00:41:34,041
Rym: And I said, I don't know how I lost.

633
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:34,985
Rym: and we put the game away.

634
00:41:35,006 --> 00:41:35,729
Rym: and that was the end of that.

635
00:41:36,192 --> 00:41:38,000
Rym: Yeah, well, he won by a lot too.

636
00:41:38,101 --> 00:41:39,970
Scott: Yeah, my example is gonna be go.

637
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:42,582
Scott: Well, some people like go and they think it's fun.

638
00:41:43,145 --> 00:41:48,063
Scott: It might be fun for them It's not fun for me, but I recognize that it is an excellent game.

639
00:41:48,164 --> 00:41:49,930
Scott: Perhaps one of the best games ever.

640
00:41:50,512 --> 00:41:51,676
Scott: I just it's it's not fun.

641
00:41:51,696 --> 00:41:53,302
Rym: make the same kind of point.

642
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:55,129
Scott: Puerto Rico Puerto Rico.

643
00:41:56,234 --> 00:41:57,720
Rym: To us people like think about.

644
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,929
Rym: there are people who love go and to them go is fun.

645
00:42:00,631 --> 00:42:08,556
Rym: Puerto Rico is very fun to people like us, but to a lot of people Puerto Rico is Objectively an extremely good game.

646
00:42:08,576 --> 00:42:10,161
Rym: It is one of the best games ever made.

647
00:42:10,281 --> 00:42:19,561
Rym: It is an absolutely beautifully constructed game But playing it is to so too many people Somewhat tedious and very difficult.

648
00:42:19,943 --> 00:42:20,787
Scott: it is difficult.

649
00:42:20,807 --> 00:42:23,033
Rym: It is not Intuitively fun.

650
00:42:23,133 --> 00:42:28,414
Scott: You have to be better at it in order for it to be to get the fun out of it or else It just it's.

651
00:42:28,716 --> 00:42:30,970
Scott: well, it's not as bad as age of steam age of steam.

652
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:38,650
Scott: There's a game that is good But not necessarily fun because you can recognize the age of steam is a great train stock market game.

653
00:42:39,294 --> 00:42:51,169
Scott: However, if you're not good at it The game just beats the freaking shit out of you and it's hard and that can often make it not fun And that when you're not doing well, you actually end up going down the tubes.

654
00:42:51,591 --> 00:42:57,942
Rym: See now this is why I mean it comes down to subjectivity and what we're talking about here Mostly are well, the fun part is more subjective.

655
00:42:57,963 --> 00:42:59,230
Scott: The good part is less subjective.

656
00:42:59,271 --> 00:43:07,505
Rym: Well, yeah But in terms of rating a game overall because no matter how good a game is Very no one almost no one will play a game that is not fun.

657
00:43:07,605 --> 00:43:09,070
Rym: No matter how good it is That's true.

658
00:43:09,451 --> 00:43:18,400
Rym: And the fact that people like us find games fun that other people don't find fun and vice versa is the reason that Puerto Rico Is very popular but monopoly is also popular.

659
00:43:18,781 --> 00:43:20,628
Rym: Yep, even though monopoly isn't good either.

660
00:43:20,648 --> 00:43:21,270
Scott: All right, what's the game?

661
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:22,336
Scott: That's good and fun.

662
00:43:22,497 --> 00:43:28,249
Rym: tigers and your friends gonna say that you bastard I think Tigers and Euphrates is perhaps the best example of that I've ever encountered.

663
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,519
Scott: It's like Kayla's is good and fun.

664
00:43:31,061 --> 00:43:33,532
Rym: Kayla's is very much good and fun I have.

665
00:43:33,552 --> 00:43:39,129
Scott: I haven't played it yet, but I have a feeling that third in taxes The latest field as you are is good and fun.

666
00:43:39,651 --> 00:43:40,434
Scott: I just got a feeling.

667
00:43:40,675 --> 00:43:44,830
Rym: see I always tell people ask me a lot especially conventions what my favorite board game is.

668
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:50,507
Rym: And I always say Puerto Rico is the best board game, but Tigers and Euphrates is my favorite.

669
00:43:50,768 --> 00:43:59,212
Rym: Yeah, I think I mean, it's it's hard to quantify why I could do a whole show on why I think that Tigers and Euphrates is the most Fun game.

670
00:43:59,232 --> 00:44:00,217
Scott: Well, we'll do it eventually.

671
00:44:00,558 --> 00:44:01,783
Rym: Well, we've talked about Tigers and Euphrates.

672
00:44:01,803 --> 00:44:03,350
Rym: Yeah, we have and we've talked about Puerto Rico.

673
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,193
Scott: I think all right.

674
00:44:04,373 --> 00:44:04,855
Rym: So have we?

675
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:07,624
Rym: I'm pretty sure we we've done like 240 episodes.

676
00:44:07,644 --> 00:44:07,985
Rym: We'd better hands.

677
00:44:09,551 --> 00:44:10,297
Scott: I'm gonna go look at it.

678
00:44:10,317 --> 00:44:13,435
Scott: We've only done like 50 something Episodes on games though.

679
00:44:13,676 --> 00:44:14,399
Rym: I think we've done 58.

680
00:44:14,399 --> 00:44:15,625
Scott: Yeah, something like that.

681
00:44:15,705 --> 00:44:16,107
Scott: All right, 59 now.

682
00:44:17,671 --> 00:44:20,338
Scott: So what is it that makes a game good?

683
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:20,699
Scott: like?

684
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,350
Scott: there are identifiable factors and I thought of a bunch of them.

685
00:44:24,471 --> 00:44:27,007
Rym: Yeah, we can't go into too much detail or we're gonna have a long episode.

686
00:44:27,027 --> 00:44:27,530
Scott: All right.

687
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:30,725
Scott: Well first is lack of randomness makes a game good.

688
00:44:30,785 --> 00:44:34,119
Scott: if a game is random Like it's just a game a chance roll a die.

689
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:34,882
Scott: See who wins.

690
00:44:35,303 --> 00:44:37,010
Scott: that makes a game not as good.

691
00:44:37,115 --> 00:44:40,844
Scott: I mean Sometimes you can have randomness and it won't suck and remember it of.

692
00:44:40,884 --> 00:44:46,803
Rym: the biggest thing is How much of a factor is the randomness and at what point is the randomness inserted?

693
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,170
Rym: a lot of good games and great games?

694
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:54,243
Rym: need randomness or else the game is deterministic where you could figure out.

695
00:44:54,744 --> 00:44:59,819
Rym: if I go first then I Must do this and then I'm most likely going to win.

696
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:05,500
Scott: For example, Puerto Rico is random in which Plantations will be available.

697
00:45:05,943 --> 00:45:08,474
Rym: That's completely random yep, and you can buy a building.

698
00:45:08,534 --> 00:45:16,140
Rym: in fact that introduces even more randomness into you personally by allowing you to draw a Plantation tile sight unseen.

699
00:45:16,362 --> 00:45:28,380
Rym: Yep, but Calus injects randomness in the very beginning by you draw the six pink tiles and you put them in a random order and that order Really has a huge effect on how the game will turn out.

700
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:37,410
Scott: it does but all that it doesn't actually have an effect on who's Going to win it just makes this time You're playing Calus different from the last time you played Calus, which is important.

701
00:45:37,471 --> 00:45:39,569
Rym: That's one of the biggest factors in making the game fun.

702
00:45:39,819 --> 00:45:42,517
Scott: Yeah because if it was the same order every time.

703
00:45:42,918 --> 00:45:46,287
Scott: then Calus would be the same game every time but eventually would get stale.

704
00:45:46,788 --> 00:45:50,303
Rym: there is the Bevagung factor or analysis paralysis.

705
00:45:50,423 --> 00:45:53,214
Scott: Yes many games Right.

706
00:45:53,234 --> 00:46:11,840
Scott: Here's example famously acquire God acquire is a game where if you sit on your turn and you just look at the game and do Calculations of every possible move that you can make you will eventually figure out the best possible move Period that you can make.

707
00:46:12,041 --> 00:46:14,314
Scott: it's not hard to figure it out It just takes some time.

708
00:46:14,775 --> 00:46:26,538
Scott: if a game is light is designed in that way where you can sit there think and eventually come up with the best move in your head then it's kind of boring because everyone sits there and does the Best possible move and it takes forever.

709
00:46:26,899 --> 00:46:33,826
Rym: some notable games that suffer from this are obviously acquire Risk to a degree you can calculate statistics forever.

710
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:43,629
Rym: Yep El Grande is huge for this and we have there's one that was one of the early board games beyond settlers that we really got Into and I kind of want to play it again.

711
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:45,559
Rym: But that is definitely a game.

712
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:48,430
Rym: if you can sit there and calculate the exact odds of everything Yeah You

713
00:46:48,471 --> 00:46:51,902
Scott: figure out exactly how many cubes to put where and then you're done

714
00:46:52,444 --> 00:47:04,668
Rym: and I'm worried that Calus to a lesser degree has this problem because the last time we played Calus I spent an extra 30 seconds every turn thinking and that had a profound effect on my strategy.

715
00:47:04,748 --> 00:47:08,501
Rym: surprisingly Yeah, like more surprisingly to me because I didn't expect.

716
00:47:08,622 --> 00:47:18,890
Rym: usually in a game like Tigers of the Euphrates You can think and think and think and there's a point at which you have exhausted All of the thinking you can do and still have an appreciable effect on your strategy.

717
00:47:19,331 --> 00:47:23,062
Rym: But Calus the more I thought the more I could optimize my turn.

718
00:47:23,523 --> 00:47:33,855
Rym: and I wonder if I'll be able to optimize my term Turn completely within a reasonable span of say 30 to 45 seconds because if I can That changes the way I play Calus.

719
00:47:33,936 --> 00:47:38,888
Rym: and if I can't but I could within five minutes that almost breaks Calus.

720
00:47:39,009 --> 00:47:43,561
Scott: Yep All right What's another good factor that makes the game good?

721
00:47:43,581 --> 00:47:44,788
Rym: I thought you had a whole bunch.

722
00:47:44,929 --> 00:47:45,190
Scott: I did.

723
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:46,336
Scott: We already talked about let's see.

724
00:47:46,456 --> 00:47:49,250
Rym: All right one that we can't explain in detail.

725
00:47:49,531 --> 00:47:52,670
Rym: We'll have to do a whole show on this because we need to talk a lot about game theory first.

726
00:47:53,294 --> 00:48:00,612
Rym: But a game that introduces Tactical decision-making that is not arbitrary Yeah The least.

727
00:48:00,853 --> 00:48:11,301
Rym: the less arbitrariness there is and the more tactical direct decision-making there is and the more weighted Decision-making there is and the more in the more utility decision-making there is.

728
00:48:11,541 --> 00:48:17,246
Rym: I'm throwing out a lot of barely comprehensible terms that mean very specific and alternating things.

729
00:48:17,387 --> 00:48:26,455
Rym: so Yeah game theory if a game is sound as per the tenets of good game theory Helps everybody out there.

730
00:48:26,515 --> 00:48:27,659
Rym: Yeah, you know what.

731
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,747
Rym: I'll read the Wikipedia on game theory.

732
00:48:29,787 --> 00:48:30,710
Scott: I'll just give an example.

733
00:48:32,152 --> 00:48:32,879
Scott: Let's think of one.

734
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:33,809
Scott: All right, here's one ready.

735
00:48:34,271 --> 00:48:40,494
Scott: You're let's say you're going down a road right and you have a choice left or right and it there's no signs There's no nothing.

736
00:48:40,595 --> 00:48:43,190
Scott: your choice is just left or right and you have no information whatsoever.

737
00:48:43,732 --> 00:48:46,179
Scott: Well, it doesn't matter which one you pick.

738
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,670
Rym: yeah, in fact you might as well remove that decision from the game.

739
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:56,188
Rym: It's like in the old match game on TV where they'd ask the contestant number one or number two And there's a different question behind each one.

740
00:48:56,651 --> 00:49:04,885
Rym: But because you don't know any information and the decision is therefore completely arbitrary It absolutely does not matter and has no effect on the universe whatsoever.

741
00:49:04,925 --> 00:49:05,668
Rym: What decision you make?

742
00:49:06,189 --> 00:49:12,589
Scott: Yep Like let's say there's a game where there are three different You know hidden cards and you get to pick one of the three.

743
00:49:13,293 --> 00:49:16,810
Scott: Why even bother just have one stack of cards and make them draw the top card?

744
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:25,447
Rym: Yeah, so good games are games that when at all possible Identify and eliminate decisions like that decisions where there isn't actually a decision.

745
00:49:25,628 --> 00:49:30,074
Scott: Yep And a tactical decision would be alright Are you?

746
00:49:30,114 --> 00:49:35,030
Scott: can either pay one to buy this building or pay three to buy that different better building?

747
00:49:35,171 --> 00:49:36,777
Scott: It's like oh well now you have to think.

748
00:49:36,797 --> 00:49:40,370
Scott: you have to think is that building worth three times as much as that building?

749
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:40,792
Scott: Etc.

750
00:49:40,812 --> 00:49:41,113
Scott: Etc.

751
00:49:41,153 --> 00:49:41,555
Scott: Etc.

752
00:49:41,675 --> 00:49:43,522
Scott: And yes is what makes a good game?

753
00:49:43,623 --> 00:49:45,149
Rym: or I have five cards in my hand.

754
00:49:45,169 --> 00:49:46,729
Rym: three of them They're blue or one of them is red.

755
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:53,550
Rym: I can discard any number of cards and draw and I know that there are 45 red cards and 39 blue cards in the deck.

756
00:49:53,952 --> 00:49:55,921
Rym: So I know my odds of getting the blue card.

757
00:49:55,961 --> 00:49:57,830
Rym: I need to complete my set and win the game.

758
00:49:58,312 --> 00:50:01,369
Rym: Is it worth it to take the risk to discard the card?

759
00:50:01,691 --> 00:50:08,020
Rym: Versus playing the card on one of my buildings in order to put a Kerblofel on the board.

760
00:50:08,302 --> 00:50:08,503
Rym: Yep.

761
00:50:09,107 --> 00:50:12,553
Rym: I Wanted to use a completely meta nonsensical example.

762
00:50:12,573 --> 00:50:13,476
Rym: there we get my idea.

763
00:50:14,419 --> 00:50:20,990
Rym: a weighted decision is like a decision where you can calculate like I Have a 55% chance of doing good with this decision.

764
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:35,536
Rym: I have a 30% chance of doing twice as good if I am successful with this decision and then based on that How far ahead you are in the game Where how long game has less to.

765
00:50:35,556 --> 00:50:36,318
Rym: you know stuff like that.

766
00:50:36,358 --> 00:50:40,130
Rym: decisions that aren't completely arbitrary and where there is information.

767
00:50:40,552 --> 00:50:43,989
Rym: The information doesn't have to be totaled but it has to be there in some form.

768
00:50:45,211 --> 00:50:48,462
Scott: Even better is when your decision isn't you know, 30% chance this 60% chance that it's.

769
00:50:48,502 --> 00:50:59,156
Scott: you know the outcome of this decision and you know the outcome of the other decision and you just can't tell which of those two outcomes is Preferable.

770
00:50:59,176 --> 00:51:01,550
Rym: or you know the outcomes of all your possible decisions.

771
00:51:02,031 --> 00:51:20,730
Rym: but across from you is a human being who has an equal but possibly asymmetric list of decisions and You have information based on his stance on the board to make a guess as to what decision he would be likely to make and His decision will have a great effect on your decision, but you end up deciding simultaneously.

772
00:51:20,871 --> 00:51:22,359
Scott: I wonder if this is getting across at all.

773
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:23,666
Rym: I hope it is.

774
00:51:23,868 --> 00:51:24,270
Scott: I hope so.

775
00:51:24,751 --> 00:51:26,536
Rym: I promise whenever we feel like it.

776
00:51:26,576 --> 00:51:28,462
Rym: We're gonna do a show on game theory.

777
00:51:28,482 --> 00:51:31,410
Rym: And when I say game theory, I mean practical game theory.

778
00:51:31,471 --> 00:51:36,250
Scott: We're not gonna talk about the math We're not gonna talk about economics because I guarantee is actually economics.

779
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:41,130
Rym: I guarantee that none of you care at all about the math behind game theory.

780
00:51:43,011 --> 00:51:50,830
Rym: Yeah, I Barely care about it and I love game theory, but sometimes reading that theory just uh, no good the numbers just god damn it.

781
00:51:51,292 --> 00:51:54,029
Scott: Alright, so let's just end the show by tell what makes a game fun.

782
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:56,675
Rym: Novelty is a big thing.

783
00:51:56,836 --> 00:51:57,901
Scott: Novelty is pretty big.

784
00:51:58,182 --> 00:52:07,210
Rym: A game that has novelty Either in individual play sessions or as a game as a whole will always lend itself to being more fun.

785
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:15,230
Rym: Games that have cool complex pieces that actually have an effect on the game or actually represents something real in the game.

786
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:17,602
Scott: What was that game where you roll the dice in a big castle?

787
00:52:17,964 --> 00:52:19,090
Rym: Oh, there's a bunch of games like that.

788
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:24,695
Scott: There's the game Niagara where there's actually little boats that go down the river and fall off the edge The Niagara Falls.

789
00:52:24,937 --> 00:52:25,178
Rym: Yep.

790
00:52:25,218 --> 00:52:26,082
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty fun.

791
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:45,510
Rym: or games like Railroad tycoon which while the game itself is fun It's not the greatest game in the world But it has this massive board and all these pieces and you get so much fun Just building your railroad managing your railroad that a lot of times even if you're losing or the game went to shit You don't even care because you're still having fun managing your railroad.

792
00:52:46,071 --> 00:52:56,906
Scott: yeah, I think one thing that definitely makes a game more fun is when you do things when you have actions and you get something out of It like if you on a turn spend some money and then build some stuff.

793
00:52:57,247 --> 00:52:57,970
Scott: that feels good.

794
00:52:57,990 --> 00:53:00,169
Scott: That's why RTS games are all are kind of fun.

795
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:12,520
Scott: yeah, because you're building stuff even if you're not winning as long as you're marching forward and You know, you're doing things often and not spending a lot of time sitting around being bored You're actively doing things all the time.

796
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:14,329
Scott: that that makes a game a lot of fun.

797
00:53:14,771 --> 00:53:17,139
Rym: It's very much railroad tycoon versus age of steam.

798
00:53:17,159 --> 00:53:27,710
Rym: They're effectively the same game except that railroad tycoon You still have the ability to take action even when your loss is a foregone conclusion.

799
00:53:28,152 --> 00:53:32,890
Rym: Yep, so no, man, even though you cannot win it is still and I'm dead serious.

800
00:53:33,031 --> 00:53:35,424
Rym: It is still fun to continue playing the game until it ends.

801
00:53:35,866 --> 00:53:39,661
Rym: age of steam The moment you fall behind by any appreciable amount.

802
00:53:40,143 --> 00:53:45,549
Rym: not only is the game not fun anymore But the one time I played age of steam and I fell behind.

803
00:53:46,094 --> 00:53:52,610
Rym: It was one of the first times in my life Where I decided that it was not worth it to me to spend my time to keep playing the game.

804
00:53:53,033 --> 00:53:55,007
Scott: Yeah, I mean there was no way to win.

805
00:53:55,047 --> 00:54:02,309
Scott: basically There's no way that we could see well that game and there was no way to take any fun Actions and you spent a lot of time doing nothing.

806
00:54:02,349 --> 00:54:04,890
Rym: now I could have avoided that situation by being better at the game.

807
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:13,573
Rym: But a game that is fun is such that no matter how badly you are doing The game is still on some level entertaining enough to keep you playing and keep you engaged Another.

808
00:54:14,075 --> 00:54:23,730
Scott: I think the last thing that makes the game fun is when there's some sort of element of Like bringing the players into the game if it be it by role-playing or humor for example.

809
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:25,716
Scott: And you play settlers right a lot of the fun.

810
00:54:25,736 --> 00:54:26,860
Scott: Hey comes are going.

811
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:27,462
Scott: Hey, man.

812
00:54:28,104 --> 00:54:33,383
Rym: I got a wood you got sheep Ha ha ha ha a joke about bestiality and erection.

813
00:54:33,483 --> 00:54:38,068
Scott: or like apples to apples where you know You act you give someone all these cards and then they go.

814
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:41,127
Rym: Hitler ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

815
00:54:41,167 --> 00:54:43,335
Rym: Gandhi Nuclear weapons.

816
00:54:43,758 --> 00:54:45,105
Scott: oh how could you do that?

817
00:54:45,145 --> 00:54:46,030
Scott: That's terrible?

818
00:54:47,834 --> 00:54:57,394
Scott: You know when there is some sort of you know human element brought into the game instead of just cold Calculating pieces moving around the board that makes a game very fun You know.

819
00:54:57,555 --> 00:55:00,455
Scott: that's why D&D is fun even though It's not really a game in.

820
00:55:00,495 --> 00:55:04,890
Rym: the D&D is a classic example of a game that is fun, but not good.

821
00:55:05,293 --> 00:55:06,829
Rym: Yes, I mean it is good at what it is.

822
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:13,989
Scott: Role-playing games in general are very different really can't be good in the same way that board games can be good.

823
00:55:14,651 --> 00:55:21,710
Rym: That I think it's possible, but games like that tend to be Role-playing games that involve military tactics.

824
00:55:22,411 --> 00:55:23,463
Scott: That is too true.

825
00:55:23,807 --> 00:55:36,257
Scott: Yes Yes But no role-playing games tend to concentrate on the fun and don't really care about me the mechanics aren't meant to be these fair difficult complex thought Experiment you know challenges.

826
00:55:36,318 --> 00:55:39,930
Scott: They're just there to support the fun of role-playing and it's totally different.

827
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:42,036
Scott: It shouldn't even be entered into this conversation.

828
00:55:42,217 --> 00:55:46,570
Rym: Yeah, and I think we'll stop there just because as always we've gone long.

829
00:55:47,134 --> 00:56:00,370
Rym: I would just like to say once again and this is probably the only time in the history of time that we will ever do this, but dig podcasts is Already the best podcast directory out there other than possibly iTunes, but a lot of you can't use iTunes.

830
00:56:01,253 --> 00:56:08,099
Rym: So if you do not use dig I recommend you use it because Forget podcast alley and podcast pickle.

831
00:56:08,139 --> 00:56:09,263
Rym: Those things are all dead to me.

832
00:56:09,503 --> 00:56:13,118
Scott: Yep, and you know already yesterday We talked about this and I didn't.

833
00:56:13,459 --> 00:56:23,897
Scott: I figured everyone who listen to get GeekNights use dig But apparently that's not true and some people already told us that they started using dig on our recommendation and they can't imagine That they weren't using it before.

834
00:56:24,138 --> 00:56:32,430
Rym: so join the front row crew forums Then look at our usernames and join the front row crew dig clan that is slowly forming.

835
00:56:32,651 --> 00:56:45,810
Rym: Yes, go to dig calm and get an account and and while you're there if you like GeekNights if you dig us It'll make us more popular and the more popular we are the more swag you're gonna get in the near future.

836
00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:48,199
Scott: Yes, but do not feel obligated to dig us.

837
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:50,587
Scott: We are not, you know begging for digs.

838
00:56:50,628 --> 00:56:51,190
Scott: We don't need them.

839
00:56:51,553 --> 00:56:57,310
Rym: Yeah, in fact, we are already Very highly placed compared to many other podcasts on dig as it is.

840
00:56:57,370 --> 00:57:03,554
Scott: That's just because we're so hip and cool with this internet action that when a new bandwagon comes along We are the first to jump on board.

841
00:57:03,895 --> 00:57:04,276
Rym: Oh, yes.

842
00:57:04,637 --> 00:57:08,930
Rym: In fact, we are on such a bleeding edge that I better go get a band-aid.

843
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:19,132
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
