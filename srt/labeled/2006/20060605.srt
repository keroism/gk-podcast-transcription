00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,447
Rym: It's Monday June 5th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:12,729 --> 00:00:17,589
Rym: tonight We begin our long-running series on how computers work from the very bottom to the very top.

3
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,681
Rym: Let's do this well as is par for the course.

4
00:00:21,802 --> 00:00:23,508
Rym: We had another crazy weekend.

5
00:00:23,528 --> 00:00:23,588
Rym: yay.

6
00:00:25,732 --> 00:00:29,430
Rym: We went to a Philly wizard world which we'll have our full coverage of on Wednesday.

7
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:32,262
Scott: I think it's actually called wizard world Philly whatever.

8
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:33,670
Rym: it was a frickin comic-con.

9
00:00:33,971 --> 00:00:36,962
Rym: That's what it was and I got my thoughts on that.

10
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:38,849
Scott: we also went to the beach.

11
00:00:39,593 --> 00:00:43,630
Rym: Oh, yeah, Jersey Shore where our friend Scott Johnson has his crazy awesome new beach house.

12
00:00:44,053 --> 00:00:45,462
Scott: Do you like to sit on the beach?

13
00:00:45,825 --> 00:00:45,966
Rym: Well?

14
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:46,328
Rym: I do.

15
00:00:47,097 --> 00:00:47,827
Scott: Do you like to?

16
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:59,227
Rym: Other euphemism for bitch yeah, yeah It was a good time because ever since go Joe you know moved away from RIT We don't see him as often as we like to.

17
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:03,929
Scott: so Yeah way down in that Philadelphia, and we're up here in that, New York.

18
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,155
Scott: Yeah It's not.

19
00:01:05,477 --> 00:01:07,209
Scott: it should be easier to get between the two.

20
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:16,464
Scott: But we live just so slightly upstate in New York that it's hard for us to get to i-95 Which is pretty much the only road from New York to Philadelphia.

21
00:01:16,484 --> 00:01:18,050
Scott: my dad's got it smart.

22
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,583
Scott: He goes to Philadelphia all the time with the airplanes.

23
00:01:20,604 --> 00:01:24,801
Rym: Oh, yeah, yep I guess we'll just have to make him come out and visit us.

24
00:01:25,725 --> 00:01:26,710
Scott: I think that's what we'll have to do.

25
00:01:26,871 --> 00:01:35,499
Scott: Yeah, it's of course you know He has that house on the beach Which we can't make the house on the beach visit us.

26
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,401
Scott: Yeah, if we found a way to teleport the bitch here I'd do it in a second, but we can't though actually what?

27
00:01:42,441 --> 00:01:44,369
Rym: the only reason I brought up the Jersey Shore is that we?

28
00:01:45,292 --> 00:01:47,209
Rym: Had a moment of geekery.

29
00:01:48,212 --> 00:01:49,636
Scott: Now the three moments of geek.

30
00:01:49,716 --> 00:01:57,062
Rym: well one particular moment myself Scott and Scott are walking down the boardwalk and suddenly We all stop.

31
00:01:57,364 --> 00:01:58,030
Scott: oh you can tell that one.

32
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,057
Rym: That's yeah that one like.

33
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:02,666
Rym: we all stop and we all turn to the left And we all look at each other like you hear that.

34
00:02:02,848 --> 00:02:05,061
Rym: yeah I hear that and we start looking around.

35
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:11,939
Scott: we don't even say like we didn't even say anything But we all we all knew and we just stopped Kind of turned and started walking into this.

36
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:22,248
Scott: now on the shore in Jersey and Wildwood on the boardwalk There's all these stores that sell shit like direct the dreckest of dreck the the schlockiest of crap.

37
00:02:22,268 --> 00:02:36,189
Scott: We're talking Cheap ass t-shirts with stupid sayings on them and girly Cheap bathing suits, and you know towels that say stuff like Beach inspector or bikini inspector ha ha ha.

38
00:02:36,932 --> 00:02:40,082
Scott: You know stupid shit like that plastic shovels for a dollar.

39
00:02:40,524 --> 00:02:40,725
Rym: Yep.

40
00:02:40,925 --> 00:02:42,190
Scott: This is just one of those stores.

41
00:02:42,572 --> 00:02:43,822
Scott: It's selling mostly girly shit.

42
00:02:44,044 --> 00:02:51,868
Rym: now that we wall We all walk in and then we hear it again And we confirm it and we know now that over the radio is playing Ayumi Hamasaki.

43
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:55,818
Scott: now That is the last thing you're going to hear in a place.

44
00:02:55,918 --> 00:02:59,094
Scott: That is pretty much McDonald's and MTV.

45
00:02:59,134 --> 00:02:59,616
Scott: well it doesn't.

46
00:02:59,636 --> 00:03:08,131
Scott: there are no chains and not a lot of chains in Wildwood is very few but Everything there is pop culture Crap.

47
00:03:08,513 --> 00:03:10,800
Scott: there's nothing that is nerdy or whatever.

48
00:03:11,161 --> 00:03:13,689
Rym: now bear in mind that this was also a very girly store.

49
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:22,462
Rym: in fact There was a gaggle of shore girls kind of hanging around inside of it in a big group Mm-hmm and the store guy looks at us and everyone looks at us.

50
00:03:22,482 --> 00:03:25,333
Rym: because we walk into the store with our ears caught kind of Looking around.

51
00:03:25,774 --> 00:03:26,698
Rym: we find an employee.

52
00:03:26,738 --> 00:03:27,882
Rym: We walk over to him.

53
00:03:27,922 --> 00:03:29,669
Rym: We kind of surround him, and he's like uh.

54
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:34,543
Rym: And then we ask so who's the Ayumi Hamasaki fan?

55
00:03:34,944 --> 00:03:35,245
Scott: Yep?

56
00:03:35,647 --> 00:03:36,149
Rym: He's like what?

57
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:50,230
Scott: Apparently most people who work on the boardwalk in fact a lot of the people who work in the United States in the summer At summer camps amusement parks boardwalks etcetera are from Europe and other parts around the world.

58
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:54,129
Rym: Yeah, so anyone complaining about you know Mexican immigrants stealing your jobs.

59
00:03:55,372 --> 00:03:58,910
Scott: Well, they're only really stealing these jobs from high school and college kids in the u.s.

60
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,199
Scott: Who want to work minimum wage all day long.

61
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:05,117
Scott: and the thing is you know they come over here to work at a summer camp Or something.

62
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,683
Scott: they get room and board You know somewhere for real cheap.

63
00:04:09,803 --> 00:04:20,490
Scott: they get paid minimum wage They get a visa so you know and they get to work here the whole summer at some crap-ass job and in return They get like a week or two of actual vacation in the u.s.

64
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:21,878
Scott: Where they go around and see stuff.

65
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:23,710
Scott: or maybe on the weekends they go and see stuff.

66
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,300
Rym: I actually wouldn't mind doing something like that over in Europe.

67
00:04:26,582 --> 00:04:28,590
Scott: You see it's a lot harder for us to do it elsewhere.

68
00:04:28,752 --> 00:04:30,835
Scott: Yeah, there's like a whole big Program.

69
00:04:30,876 --> 00:04:36,842
Scott: it's very easy for them to come here and do it But for us to do it elsewhere is not as easy, but it's not so hard.

70
00:04:37,063 --> 00:04:40,334
Rym: this guy was obviously very into you know Techno.

71
00:04:40,394 --> 00:04:52,450
Scott: he was definitely a European dude And he just you know had a friend who downloaded some cool music on the internet some sort of techno euro mix compilation Which we're pretty sure was the a yumi euro mix compilation.

72
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:55,824
Scott: Yes There are CDs called I a dash euro.

73
00:04:55,945 --> 00:04:56,608
Scott: why you are?

74
00:04:56,728 --> 00:04:57,050
Scott: Oh mix.

75
00:04:57,593 --> 00:04:59,305
Scott: And I think there's like at least four of these things.

76
00:04:59,405 --> 00:05:07,704
Scott: they take a yumi Hamasaki songs and euro be ties them and they make a big mega mix CD And there's like a whole bunch of these things they put out and they're good.

77
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:08,730
Rym: I mean I'm a huge fan of you.

78
00:05:08,971 --> 00:05:10,035
Scott: I have a few of them there.

79
00:05:10,095 --> 00:05:13,510
Rym: despite the fact that she is like the idol do like crazy.

80
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,619
Scott: Oh, I'm the Madonna of Japan.

81
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:18,250
Scott: yeah, she doesn't suck, but you know what I'm convinced.

82
00:05:18,592 --> 00:05:20,747
Scott: If I knew what the lyrics meant I would think they were stupid.

83
00:05:20,827 --> 00:05:24,470
Rym: honestly You know what I do know what the lyrics mean to a couple of the songs.

84
00:05:24,651 --> 00:05:30,889
Rym: I liked him a lot, and I looked it up a while ago, and at least the songs I looked at were actually good songs of their own merit.

85
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:37,119
Scott: Yeah, but you know Whatever Forget that I haven't looked at.

86
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,366
Scott: the point is is that there was.

87
00:05:38,427 --> 00:05:44,949
Scott: there was a yumi Hamasaki on in a place that it shouldn't be and I guess or it was unexpected for it to be should be everywhere.

88
00:05:44,989 --> 00:05:50,569
Rym: our geek Dar is so highly tuned that we immediately picked up on it and sought it out.

89
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:56,830
Scott: Well when a place is so devoid of geekery then some anything geeky at all.

90
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:02,947
Scott: I mean like if a pixelated Mario Like if a McDonald's Mario toy was sitting in the sand.

91
00:06:03,008 --> 00:06:03,390
Scott: we'd be like.

92
00:06:05,623 --> 00:06:13,749
Scott: But When there's a strong geekery at a convention then only the awesome You know geekery is really stand out and grant we gravitate towards them.

93
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,360
Rym: Other than that we played some arcade games as usual.

94
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:20,511
Rym: I learned that I still have my DDR skills quite Strongly.

95
00:06:20,932 --> 00:06:22,978
Scott: yeah, my DDR skills are fading slightly.

96
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:23,861
Scott: I got to start playing that.

97
00:06:23,881 --> 00:06:26,790
Scott: yes you do or but they're not fading too much.

98
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:35,008
Scott: I can still do pretty much any medium normal songs, and I could still do some crepe maniac songs But not the really hard ones just the normal ones.

99
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:45,109
Scott: yeah We showed up some punk kids who have grown up in the current generation for God to play air hockey Yeah, and you didn't want to play the hockey with the sticks on the whatever because I was in line for DDR.

100
00:06:45,731 --> 00:06:51,810
Scott: Yeah, like the hockey and we did the only new good game that was at the shore because there are other new good arcade games.

101
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:57,405
Scott: They just didn't have them was House of the Dead 4 where you get an Uzi and it can also.

102
00:06:57,585 --> 00:07:01,670
Scott: you can also throw grenades And you can shake the Uzi to get zombies off of you.

103
00:07:01,831 --> 00:07:02,476
Rym: It looks pretty good.

104
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:12,752
Scott: Yeah, it's definitely More fun than the you know original house of the dead where you just had the stupid pistol that was weak and had no feedback Or anything.

105
00:07:13,355 --> 00:07:14,458
Scott: the shotgun one was good.

106
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:15,181
Scott: That was number three.

107
00:07:15,221 --> 00:07:17,348
Scott: I think but this one is definitely fun.

108
00:07:18,131 --> 00:07:19,559
Scott: I'll probably beat it when we go down there again.

109
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:21,410
Scott: They're also some good pinballs.

110
00:07:23,092 --> 00:07:26,729
Rym: So in actual news the Pirate Bay, it's back.

111
00:07:27,211 --> 00:07:32,870
Rym: Yep, it took him what a few days to get themselves back on their feet despite the volley from the Hollywood.

112
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:37,410
Scott: I think they're back up with a server in Russia Ukraine Holland and somewhere else.

113
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,514
Scott: I don't know now.

114
00:07:38,635 --> 00:07:46,809
Rym: normally what's happened in the past is whenever a site like this was taken down a New site would spring up somewhere else, and it was always kind of this whack-a-mole game for the MPAA.

115
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:48,955
Rym: This one didn't work that way.

116
00:07:48,995 --> 00:07:51,282
Rym: the MPAA hit this mole and the same.

117
00:07:51,343 --> 00:07:52,025
Rym: it just sat there.

118
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:54,538
Scott: the mole didn't move and as soon As they picked up the mallet.

119
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:55,707
Scott: it popped her right back up.

120
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:58,860
Rym: I consider this a victory for the free world.

121
00:07:59,422 --> 00:08:01,249
Scott: We're going to kick some ass.

122
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:04,646
Scott: Yeah Finally somebody says we will not take your sheet.

123
00:08:04,989 --> 00:08:07,907
Scott: of course They say they will not take your heat because they are from the Sweden.

124
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:16,516
Rym: now I would submit that anyone out there who hasn't been to the Pirate's Bay before go there And even if you've been there is often Go there and look at it.

125
00:08:16,556 --> 00:08:21,701
Rym: because they changed their site graphic a little bit to commemorate the fact that once again They kicked Hollywood's ass.

126
00:08:21,923 --> 00:08:32,188
Scott: yeah right now They're having some problems of the database which is bound to happen when you move a site like that to four countries from one and From a giant data center to who knows what?

127
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,078
Scott: But I'm sure it'll be back up real soon.

128
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:37,188
Scott: Yeah, that's that's a technical problem.

129
00:08:37,207 --> 00:08:37,549
Scott: who cares?

130
00:08:38,871 --> 00:08:41,058
Scott: Alright, so I got a news.

131
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:42,965
Scott: It's a little bit complicated, so I gotta explain it.

132
00:08:43,226 --> 00:08:44,250
Rym: Yeah explain away.

133
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,775
Scott: There's a company called the Vonage.

134
00:08:45,835 --> 00:08:47,401
Scott: you may or may not know of this company.

135
00:08:47,622 --> 00:08:49,026
Scott: They sell vo IP.

136
00:08:49,689 --> 00:08:53,761
Scott: now You might be like hey skype is vo IP and it's free.

137
00:08:54,223 --> 00:09:01,869
Scott: well now you see the problem with this company Basically if you're the kind of person who set up sets up an asterisk server.

138
00:09:02,714 --> 00:09:04,605
Scott: You can pay Vonage for minutes.

139
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:08,459
Scott: now There are also a bunch of other companies that will sell you minutes.

140
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,402
Scott: vo IP minutes.

141
00:09:09,824 --> 00:09:11,649
Scott: lots of them shit tons of them.

142
00:09:12,131 --> 00:09:17,490
Scott: Vonage isn't the only one but Vonage is probably the biggest one the one that people know that the trusted name.

143
00:09:17,952 --> 00:09:22,970
Scott: All the most of the other ones are these companies you never heard of Even though they're still legitimate.

144
00:09:24,116 --> 00:09:26,219
Scott: so Vonage you could also.

145
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:28,430
Scott: you know we have optimum online.

146
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:33,625
Scott: we can also got some on cable and optimum voice where our cable company will sell us vo IP.

147
00:09:34,246 --> 00:09:34,928
Scott: if you want.

148
00:09:34,988 --> 00:09:45,250
Scott: you can pay Vonage and get a little vo IP phones and plug them into your you know internet router and Talk on the phone and it'll give you a phone number and everything.

149
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:52,035
Scott: So this company Vonage had an IPO Initial public offering.

150
00:09:52,196 --> 00:09:53,660
Scott: yes, that means we are going.

151
00:09:53,681 --> 00:10:00,846
Scott: we are not on the stock market, but now we are And it's the IPO is where you give everyone a chance to buy your stock.

152
00:10:00,907 --> 00:10:02,475
Scott: at the beginning you say This is the beginning.

153
00:10:02,818 --> 00:10:04,290
Rym: yep companies all do it different ways.

154
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:16,989
Scott: I mean Google made a lot of press for doing it in a kind of funny special way yep Which had mixed results, but the point is Vonage had nor a relatively normal IPO except for one little catch.

155
00:10:17,961 --> 00:10:25,149
Scott: they said To their customers that they were going to give the customers of Vonage a chance to get in on the IPO.

156
00:10:26,611 --> 00:10:27,736
Scott: Okay, that's cool.

157
00:10:27,977 --> 00:10:33,377
Scott: That's like if Google came to all the Gmail users and said hey We're gonna let you into the IPO first.

158
00:10:33,437 --> 00:10:44,016
Scott: now the way they did this is they said hey customers of Vonage No matter what you guys can buy Vonage shares at $17 a share.

159
00:10:46,071 --> 00:10:58,127
Scott: So even if the stock the IPO makes the stock start jumping up crazily if you want to and you fill out this form You know for being a Vonage customer you could buy as many shares you want $70 a share.

160
00:10:59,212 --> 00:11:03,417
Scott: I don't know if as many shares as you want, but you know it's a certain number of shares You could buy $17 a share.

161
00:11:06,555 --> 00:11:07,508
Scott: Now here's what happened.

162
00:11:08,453 --> 00:11:13,890
Scott: The the assumption by the Vonage customers was oh, this is a great deal because the stock will jump right away.

163
00:11:14,051 --> 00:11:19,067
Scott: I'll only pay 17 bucks, and then I'll sell it and I'll make money and it'll help out Vonage.

164
00:11:19,087 --> 00:11:19,810
Scott: You know how about me.

165
00:11:19,911 --> 00:11:20,500
Scott: It's a great deal.

166
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,230
Scott: Vonage's stock didn't go up.

167
00:11:25,273 --> 00:11:26,441
Scott: It went down to $12 a share.

168
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:31,256
Scott: Yeah So the customers.

169
00:11:31,918 --> 00:11:32,500
Scott: what happened?

170
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:39,230
Scott: because they agreed to buy X shares at $17 a share ended up just losing money.

171
00:11:41,212 --> 00:11:44,345
Scott: And they had they even though they they still have to pay the $17 a share.

172
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,610
Scott: They can't pay the $12 a share that they should pay.

173
00:11:49,555 --> 00:11:52,049
Scott: They had to pay the 17 because that's what they agreed to.

174
00:11:53,371 --> 00:12:03,397
Scott: So they went to the SEC the Security Exchange Commission and said yeah, and the SEC is like uh-huh We're gonna do something about this.

175
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:07,810
Rym: yeah, so Vonage might be in some deep doodoo deep doodoos.

176
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:16,277
Scott: So I think this is the the official end of IPOs being stupid.

177
00:12:16,438 --> 00:12:18,930
Scott: crazy profitable stocks go up crazily thing.

178
00:12:19,262 --> 00:12:32,510
Rym: Yeah Because it seems like it's the perception among business people these days not like high up business people that people who are running a small business or a company that IPOing is a way to make a whole bunch of money with absolutely no consequences.

179
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,016
Rym: yeah, that Seems to be the way they treat IPOs.

180
00:12:36,036 --> 00:12:36,518
Rym: nowadays.

181
00:12:36,538 --> 00:12:48,105
Scott: at least the high-tech IPOs seem to be where they start the stock price real low and then everyone buys it because it's a crazy high-tech company and it goes way up.

182
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:56,190
Scott: and The thing is is Vonage isn't profitable and had no plan to be profitable and people didn't go up.

183
00:12:56,371 --> 00:12:57,516
Scott: This is telling everyone.

184
00:12:57,797 --> 00:13:02,081
Scott: We don't care how high-tech or fancy you are if you're not gonna be profitable You're not gonna get invested in.

185
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:03,070
Rym: that's a good change.

186
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:15,667
Rym: I mean for any of you who actually remember the dot-com bust a big part of that was that people who didn't understand Technology would hear about a high-tech company and just pump money into it assuming that high-tech always means good.

187
00:13:15,687 --> 00:13:20,516
Rym: I Guess now people are actually looking at what a company does You know.

188
00:13:20,536 --> 00:13:21,503
Rym: do they do anything?

189
00:13:21,523 --> 00:13:26,804
Rym: there were a lot of companies Not only did not make money, but they didn't do anything.

190
00:13:27,065 --> 00:13:33,207
Rym: there were companies that I shit You not did nothing never made a product never did anything, but advertise themselves.

191
00:13:33,227 --> 00:13:33,930
Scott: Oh infinium left.

192
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,576
Rym: What are you talking about?

193
00:13:37,596 --> 00:13:40,665
Rym: I'm gonna buy a phantom console, oh, okay, yeah, you know what.

194
00:13:40,705 --> 00:13:45,436
Rym: when it comes out, I'll buy it, okay Well, it's gonna come out tomorrow.

195
00:13:45,476 --> 00:13:47,203
Scott: I'm gonna laugh as Rym shells out like $800 for this.

196
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:47,464
Scott: nothing.

197
00:13:47,484 --> 00:13:50,014
Rym: now You know what I'll do at that point.

198
00:13:50,536 --> 00:13:52,283
Rym: break my word not buy it.

199
00:13:52,323 --> 00:13:53,066
Scott: you only get three.

200
00:13:53,106 --> 00:13:54,090
Scott: you're gonna waste one on that.

201
00:13:54,352 --> 00:13:54,755
Scott: We'll see.

202
00:13:54,836 --> 00:13:56,209
Rym: I don't think I'm gonna have to waste one.

203
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,373
Scott: All right, all right.

204
00:13:58,694 --> 00:13:58,855
Rym: Well.

205
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,400
Rym: I didn't say exactly when I'd buy it.

206
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:01,103
Rym: I could buy it.

207
00:14:01,143 --> 00:14:02,367
Rym: You know when my deathbed.

208
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:05,850
Rym: It's true Yeah, it's true got to be tricky with that sort of thing.

209
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,759
Scott: But what if there aren't any left when you'd like?

210
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:08,743
Scott: what if they're all destroyed?

211
00:14:09,185 --> 00:14:10,210
Rym: as long as I tried to buy one?

212
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:10,801
Rym: That's good enough.

213
00:14:11,911 --> 00:14:16,290
Rym: That doesn't count if you gives you if you view word to someone that you'll try to you'll do something you fail to do.

214
00:14:16,412 --> 00:14:17,368
Rym: But you try your best.

215
00:14:18,193 --> 00:14:22,288
Scott: I'm gonna try my best to buy this car that a Ferrari.

216
00:14:22,308 --> 00:14:23,635
Scott: right now I can't afford one.

217
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:23,897
Scott: the end.

218
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,009
Scott: I tried my best at least you tried.

219
00:14:35,804 --> 00:14:49,579
Rym: So things of the day in keeping with my List of old old old school things of the day old incredibly old School partly because we haven't found anything particularly new and exciting on the internet recently.

220
00:14:51,222 --> 00:15:00,559
Rym: This is something we discovered at RIT quite some time ago, and it was very popular and very cool and It actually got a lot of people into Daft Punk who otherwise had never heard of them.

221
00:15:01,622 --> 00:15:03,712
Scott: If you don't know Daft Punk is too awesome.

222
00:15:03,853 --> 00:15:05,140
Scott: They're two French guys.

223
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,159
Scott: You know what who wear?

224
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,291
Scott: Masks, so you don't know what they look like.

225
00:15:08,372 --> 00:15:10,202
Scott: so you if you saw them on the street You wouldn't know.

226
00:15:10,222 --> 00:15:16,760
Rym: and they make awesome tech knows if you've never heard of Daft Punk And this is the first time you ever heard anything.

227
00:15:17,221 --> 00:15:22,817
Rym: I want you to go out whether you like anime or not and buy this DVD called interstellar 5 5 5.

228
00:15:22,817 --> 00:15:31,860
Scott: the animation is by Leiji Matsumoto the guy who makes Galaxy Express and all that stuff And it's basically this giant music video of Daft Punk.

229
00:15:32,161 --> 00:15:38,300
Rym: It just imagine an entire album and then someone made a movie that is perfectly synced to the album entirely and there's no talking.

230
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,040
Rym: It's really really cool.

231
00:15:41,281 --> 00:15:42,548
Rym: And it don't.

232
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:47,835
Rym: if you were one of those people who I don't like anime Forget that it's anime think of it as something cool and watch it.

233
00:15:48,117 --> 00:15:48,740
Scott: It's real.

234
00:15:48,821 --> 00:15:52,640
Scott: I think Daft Punk's actual music videos for that album.

235
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:58,160
Scott: What they did is they just cut up this movie and took the piece out that had the song and said that was the mute.

236
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:06,887
Rym: You know that was a music video But this is a little flash that someone made and is very simple like very simple But for some reason it works really well with the song.

237
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:13,592
Rym: more than ever hour after our work is never over down down down And it's to what?

238
00:16:13,652 --> 00:16:18,459
Rym: River City Ransom Nark Barbie and a boy in his blob.

239
00:16:19,903 --> 00:16:21,877
Rym: Yeah, I love the little dance the boy does.

240
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:28,484
Scott: yep All right, so my thing of the day is Sega Fantasy 6.

241
00:16:28,484 --> 00:16:39,460
Rym: Now I'll warn you Scott's thing if you're not a if you're not a video game fan of the older school persuasion as in you know about You know NES and future consoles.

242
00:16:40,661 --> 00:16:41,784
Rym: You're not gonna find this funny.

243
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:46,980
Scott: if you've never played Final Fantasy 6 and beaten it you won't understand a lot of the joke.

244
00:16:48,021 --> 00:17:04,339
Scott: But basically this thing they took the ending of Final Fantasy 6 and they replaced all the characters With sprites of video game consoles every console you can imagine There's a Jeep all the consoles that were out at the time when they made.

245
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:07,018
Scott: well yeah, you're not gonna see any wheeze or anything.

246
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:22,817
Scott: and And The plot is awesome because it matches the history of the consoles as well as matching the Character the the characters in Final Fantasy 6 and the plot of Final Fantasy 6.

247
00:17:22,817 --> 00:17:28,019
Rym: and it's high Larius unless you're not old school, and then it's just dumb.

248
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:29,628
Scott: It's sort of.

249
00:17:29,688 --> 00:17:31,800
Scott: it's like reading penny arcade if you understand it.

250
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,976
Scott: It's great if your grandma, and you're not old grandma hardcore, and you're just normal grandma.

251
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:36,598
Scott: You won't get it.

252
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:38,849
Scott: Think it's offensive and stupid.

253
00:17:39,171 --> 00:17:43,498
Rym: at least penny arcade always as the gaming joke But there's always the puerile joke there along with it.

254
00:17:44,262 --> 00:17:48,338
Scott: I also want to point out how the bad guy in Sega Fantasy 6 is BSP.

255
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,393
Scott: That's all I gotta say.

256
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,100
Rym: Alright, so we've been talking a long time on it.

257
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:08,800
Rym: We wanted to do a series like a long series on how computers work Yep, and we've delayed it for many a moon for various reasons ranging from being tired to having news to talk about.

258
00:18:10,744 --> 00:18:11,960
Scott: So this series?

259
00:18:12,644 --> 00:18:16,183
Scott: I don't know if we're gonna do it every Monday until it's done but probably not.

260
00:18:16,283 --> 00:18:25,675
Scott: we're gonna do it a whole lot of Mondays from here on out and You might make a separate feed for it in case someone wants to listen to just this or something like that.

261
00:18:25,735 --> 00:18:33,378
Scott: who knows not right now But we're going to tell you Basically I said basically three times today.

262
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:43,478
Scott: We are going to give you our Let's see like zillions of dollars in RIT education for free.

263
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:55,699
Rym: Yep, we're going to start with the basic basic basics of computers and what they are and how they work to the very top - here is how like this operating system does this.

264
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:06,519
Scott: Theoretically if you listen to our podcast and all of these episodes You will know just as much about how a computer works as we do.

265
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:12,460
Rym: Granted that will take you a long time because we are going to do this over a long period of time.

266
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:21,804
Scott: also, we are going to use many simplifications abstractions and analogies so that even the dumbest person can Understand as long as all.

267
00:19:22,566 --> 00:19:26,396
Scott: even a dumb person not the dumbest person probably won't understand no matter what.

268
00:19:26,496 --> 00:19:29,244
Rym: but dumbest person hasn't figured out how to download GeekNights.

269
00:19:29,485 --> 00:19:35,705
Scott: the dumbest person it probably has some sort of horrible learning disorder and Won't be able to learn anyway.

270
00:19:35,886 --> 00:19:38,876
Rym: either that or is in the White House where you really can't get a good internet connection.

271
00:19:38,896 --> 00:19:41,824
Rym: Yeah Yeah had to.

272
00:19:42,024 --> 00:19:43,531
Rym: I had to throw some sort of dig in there.

273
00:19:43,591 --> 00:19:44,957
Scott: or learning disorder in the white hat.

274
00:19:45,258 --> 00:19:45,439
Rym: yeah.

275
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:56,896
Scott: so If you at any time have a question about anything we say or You're smarter than us and you want to correct us on something stupid.

276
00:19:56,936 --> 00:20:01,339
Scott: We said You got to use the email and the forums and we'll clear that up.

277
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,693
Rym: Yeah, either email us send us a you know an email an audio email.

278
00:20:05,753 --> 00:20:07,378
Rym: call that number we used to pin.

00:20:07,438 --> 00:20:08,000
Rym: do something.

280
00:20:08,221 --> 00:20:11,780
Scott: Yeah, GeekNights at G at front row crew calm now.

281
00:20:11,881 --> 00:20:17,000
Rym: We love audio feedback But it seems like a lot of you are for whatever reason afraid of sending us audio of your voice.

282
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:19,760
Rym: So if you want to ask a question.

283
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,958
Rym: But you don't want to record something just email us and we'll read it on the air and do it.

284
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:29,680
Rym: Yep, and if we don't answer your question or we ignore it that just means we're waiting until we do the show on that specifically.

285
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:32,327
Scott: Or you said something incredibly stupid.

286
00:20:32,388 --> 00:20:33,993
Rym: No, you said something incredibly stupid.

287
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,880
Rym: We'll be all about all on about that.

288
00:20:36,141 --> 00:20:37,407
Scott: We still haven't received a hate mail.

289
00:20:37,749 --> 00:20:38,653
Rym: never I'm waiting.

290
00:20:38,934 --> 00:20:43,633
Rym: the closest thing to a hate mail We've gotten is like is male and foreign languages where I wasn't sure what it said.

291
00:20:43,935 --> 00:20:44,296
Scott: spam.

292
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:45,360
Rym: Yeah, it was spam.

293
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:47,352
Rym: It was Hispanic spam for some Hispanic album.

294
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:48,600
Scott: You had to know what the hell that was.

295
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,304
Rym: Yeah, they were trying.

296
00:20:49,345 --> 00:20:50,573
Rym: I think they're trying to get us to shell it.

297
00:20:50,915 --> 00:20:51,418
Scott: forget that.

298
00:20:51,438 --> 00:20:58,840
Scott: I Don't know why they if they were trying to get us to show something why why do they think we speak Spanish?

299
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,845
Scott: I don't get.

300
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:07,500
Rym: well, I do find it interesting and I say this a lot How many of our listeners are overseas and in foreign countries other than the United States?

301
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,984
Scott: Yeah, but they understand English.

302
00:21:09,024 --> 00:21:11,131
Scott: if you don't understand the English language, you can't listen to us.

303
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:15,899
Rym: Maybe they just assume well for bilingual Maybe they're trying to learn English.

304
00:21:16,962 --> 00:21:19,570
Scott: I can actually kind of read a Spanish newspaper kinda.

305
00:21:19,691 --> 00:21:22,460
Rym: Yeah, I can surely almost the same in French.

306
00:21:22,793 --> 00:21:23,266
Scott: Yep Like.

307
00:21:23,347 --> 00:21:23,959
Rym: I can read.

308
00:21:24,502 --> 00:21:24,662
Rym: Like.

309
00:21:24,682 --> 00:21:29,739
Rym: I remember I looked up some yamakaze site and I could kind of follow along and I could figure out the gist of it.

310
00:21:30,463 --> 00:21:32,859
Rym: But if someone's speaking French to me, it's like whoa there.

311
00:21:33,642 --> 00:21:36,971
Scott: Alright, so let's start talking about how a computer works.

312
00:21:37,051 --> 00:21:40,220
Scott: But first you must talk about what a computer is.

313
00:21:41,621 --> 00:21:43,728
Rym: So then what is a computer?

314
00:21:43,788 --> 00:21:44,049
Rym: I mean?

315
00:21:44,531 --> 00:21:49,467
Rym: on a fundamental level it doesn't do very much It just does a lot of very little.

316
00:21:49,888 --> 00:21:50,510
Rym: very quickly.

317
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:54,242
Scott: a computer needs three things.

318
00:21:54,603 --> 00:21:56,628
Scott: number one the input.

319
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,615
Scott: it input can be almost anything in could.

320
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:15,860
Scott: input could be a keyboard or a mouse or a touchscreen or a voice or a photo sensor or a Or a retina scan or a photocell or a fingerprint scan or a scanner.

321
00:22:17,224 --> 00:22:23,293
Scott: it could be anything that takes information and Gathers it and sends it down a wire.

322
00:22:23,494 --> 00:22:24,118
Scott: That's input.

323
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:27,688
Scott: Step two the processing.

324
00:22:28,511 --> 00:22:29,514
Rym: it is deterministic.

325
00:22:29,714 --> 00:22:31,400
Rym: computers aren't magic things.

326
00:22:31,781 --> 00:22:33,506
Rym: They they are deterministic.

327
00:22:33,606 --> 00:22:45,519
Scott: and when if an input comes in you can predict the output with the same computer with the same Program is given the same input It will do the same thing every time unless the computer is broken.

328
00:22:46,322 --> 00:22:57,000
Scott: so the processing takes the input and based on the computer because you know different computers do different things will Do some processing on the input it will do something.

329
00:22:57,703 --> 00:23:05,407
Scott: so maybe it's a calculator and it will take the inputs of what buttons you pushed and Process those inputs to create.

330
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:23,330
Scott: the third thing the output which could be the monitor the speakers the The electric zapper that gives you a shock for being stupid the force feedback and the steering wheel the who knows You know the little LCD screen on the calculator is the output,

331
00:23:24,213 --> 00:23:25,979
Rym: but that that's all a computer does.

332
00:23:26,842 --> 00:23:27,644
Rym: They did they?

333
00:23:27,664 --> 00:23:33,900
Rym: just they take input they process it in some deterministic reliable predictable way, and then they output something.

334
00:23:34,523 --> 00:23:37,940
Scott: Yep, that's the simplest computer in the universe his.

335
00:23:38,964 --> 00:23:40,598
Scott: Well, here's the thing you have to do.

336
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,931
Scott: There's a line between.

337
00:23:43,012 --> 00:23:44,560
Scott: a computer doesn't have to be electronic.

338
00:23:44,941 --> 00:23:46,364
Scott: You can have a mechanical computer.

339
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:51,416
Scott: any device which takes input process it and makes output is a computer.

340
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:57,627
Rym: and there were in fact prototypical and small Mechanical computers a lot.

341
00:23:57,647 --> 00:24:14,820
Scott: first computers are mechanical Pascal and damage made mechanical wooden slash Whatever adding machines and you can go Go on to Wikipedia and read about Blaise Pascal, and I don't know Babbage's of the name, but yeah Babbage There probably isn't another Babbage to read about now these computers.

342
00:24:14,941 --> 00:24:22,959
Rym: I mean, I'm actually reading a sci-fi about that right now, but computers that are mechanical are no different than the computers that electrical other than the way they function.

343
00:24:22,979 --> 00:24:31,520
Rym: and It's really only a matter of the fact that Mechanical computers were very large very slow and very unreliable and expensive.

344
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:41,705
Scott: Yep in the really in the future what the scientists are working on it's sort of like a cold fusion where it might not work but they're trying anyway is Quantum computers that aren't even electronic.

345
00:24:41,785 --> 00:24:42,567
Scott: They're quantum.

346
00:24:42,868 --> 00:24:45,294
Scott: so the processing is all done by quantum physics.

347
00:24:45,635 --> 00:24:46,377
Scott: crazy bullshit.

348
00:24:46,738 --> 00:24:48,604
Scott: the problem with that Not bullshit, but crazy.

349
00:24:48,684 --> 00:24:50,150
Rym: it's a problem with those computers.

350
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,840
Rym: Is that we don't actually understand quantum physics?

351
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:54,267
Scott: No, we don't know what does?

352
00:24:54,347 --> 00:24:55,553
Rym: we know a lot about it.

353
00:24:55,714 --> 00:24:57,000
Rym: We can predict quantum physics.

354
00:24:57,281 --> 00:25:01,940
Rym: We know that if we do X Y happens, and it happens reliable, but we don't know the in-between.

355
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:05,800
Rym: Yeah, and we don't know why and every now and then it doesn't work.

356
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,785
Rym: That's the problem.

357
00:25:06,966 --> 00:25:09,620
Scott: when you make a computer you need to know the whole in-between.

358
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:11,590
Scott: Because that's the thing about computers.

359
00:25:11,852 --> 00:25:13,340
Rym: because really I can't stress this enough.

360
00:25:13,421 --> 00:25:16,120
Rym: I know I've said it a bunch of times, but computers are deterministic.

361
00:25:16,742 --> 00:25:19,088
Rym: They are exact for any given input.

362
00:25:19,129 --> 00:25:21,676
Rym: the output will always always be the same.

363
00:25:21,856 --> 00:25:32,756
Scott: if I have a functioning calculator That is correctly programmed, and I press 1 plus 1 equals It'll say 2. if I do it again It'll say 2 no matter how many times they do it as long as the calculator isn't broken.

364
00:25:33,077 --> 00:25:37,523
Rym: It'll say - yeah I was about to say unless it's a penny one That's right.

365
00:25:37,825 --> 00:25:38,347
Rym: That's the story.

366
00:25:38,387 --> 00:25:40,315
Scott: We can tell when we get as long as it isn't broken.

367
00:25:40,657 --> 00:25:53,400
Scott: It'll say - Okay so When people ask you how a computer works The common answer is zeros and ones zeros and ones.

368
00:25:54,422 --> 00:26:00,392
Scott: Now who out there thinks they're little zeros and little ones floating around inside a computer?

369
00:26:00,774 --> 00:26:02,020
Scott: anybody anybody?

370
00:26:03,202 --> 00:26:07,708
Scott: Okay, well obviously you might be smart enough to have said no You know what.

371
00:26:07,728 --> 00:26:09,438
Rym: if anyone answered us right now?

372
00:26:11,346 --> 00:26:15,044
Scott: Yeah, if anyone said yes Go home.

373
00:26:15,586 --> 00:26:18,920
Rym: if anyone said no go home because you just answered a one-way broadcast.

374
00:26:21,541 --> 00:26:25,712
Scott: Seriously there are not little zeros and ones floating around inside your computer.

375
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:31,720
Rym: in fact not only that but the whole idea of a Zero and one is is just a an abstraction.

376
00:26:32,262 --> 00:26:33,244
Rym: Yep, it's an ideal.

377
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:36,253
Rym: It's something that doesn't actually exist does not really exist.

378
00:26:36,273 --> 00:26:37,076
Scott: It's just an idea.

379
00:26:37,176 --> 00:26:38,079
Scott: They're arbitrary.

380
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,252
Scott: yep What is in the computer.

381
00:26:40,956 --> 00:26:43,675
Scott: well electricity dumbass.

382
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:45,791
Scott: What's in there?

383
00:26:45,832 --> 00:26:46,399
Scott: electricity?

384
00:26:47,901 --> 00:26:49,668
Rym: Whole bunch of silicon and all that stuff.

385
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:52,720
Scott: That's just ways for the electricity to move around.

386
00:26:53,142 --> 00:26:56,039
Rym: There's a couple every now and then there's some computers have mechanical things in them.

387
00:26:56,502 --> 00:26:56,985
Scott: That's true.

388
00:26:57,025 --> 00:26:59,480
Scott: a hard drive has like a motor to spin the disk.

389
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:05,480
Scott: Yeah, old old old computers had relay some parts of the computer magnetic which is kind of electricity.

390
00:27:07,882 --> 00:27:09,070
Rym: I'm gonna let that one slide.

391
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:09,936
Scott: Yeah, I'm just being silly.

392
00:27:10,057 --> 00:27:14,364
Rym: okay Okay now Where do we should?

393
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:16,594
Rym: we probably go a little bit to ones and zeros?

394
00:27:16,694 --> 00:27:17,960
Rym: Why do we use ones and zeros?

395
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,204
Rym: Why are one and zero special?

396
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:23,700
Rym: yep because that is the simplest logic that exists.

397
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:28,195
Rym: There is either true or false one or zero yes, or no.

398
00:27:28,255 --> 00:27:29,680
Rym: those all mean the same two things.

399
00:27:30,022 --> 00:27:32,919
Rym: It is a perfect dichotomy between yes and no with no middle ground.

400
00:27:33,422 --> 00:27:38,020
Scott: Yep, now there are computers that have zero one and two zero one two and three.

401
00:27:38,462 --> 00:27:41,640
Scott: But we're not gonna teach you about those computers because they're crazy and no one uses them.

402
00:27:41,901 --> 00:27:43,328
Scott: Yeah, some people use them.

403
00:27:43,368 --> 00:27:45,720
Rym: actually the Russians did a lot of research in that regard.

404
00:27:45,961 --> 00:27:50,860
Rym: I used to know a lot about it because I was really curious about it until I learned that it's mostly complicated and difficult.

405
00:27:51,601 --> 00:27:56,443
Scott: Okay, now we're gonna be talking mostly about your computer not computers You're never going to use.

406
00:27:56,644 --> 00:28:00,779
Rym: your computer is basically sitting there millions and millions of time per second going yes.

407
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:03,113
Rym: No yes Yes, no yes, no yes, no no no yes, no yes, no.

408
00:28:03,717 --> 00:28:11,116
Scott: in fact There are like millions of yeses and noes and a big mix all at once and then all at once again and all at once again.

409
00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:13,999
Scott: Now what is the zero and the one?

410
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,586
Scott: What's the different?

411
00:28:15,646 --> 00:28:18,019
Scott: how do you get from the electricity to the zero and a one?

412
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:18,200
Scott: well?

413
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:23,233
Rym: That's entirely arbitrary based on whatever you wanted to do as an engineer making a computer.

414
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:27,427
Scott: That's correct, but in terms of normal computing Let's say I have a wire.

415
00:28:27,447 --> 00:28:28,713
Scott: It's just a wire.

416
00:28:28,733 --> 00:28:33,200
Scott: It's just sitting there at Zero no electricity on the wire.

417
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,420
Scott: Now you get some battery going on and there's some electricity on the wire.

418
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:40,859
Scott: That's a one coming out the end of that wire.

419
00:28:41,661 --> 00:28:43,469
Rym: Now at this point you have to decide.

420
00:28:43,751 --> 00:28:45,820
Rym: What's the line between zero and one?

421
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,490
Rym: I mean what if there's a little bit of static electricity going down?

422
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,334
Rym: does that count as a one?

423
00:28:49,354 --> 00:28:51,705
Rym: because it's either one or zero At any given time?

424
00:28:52,046 --> 00:28:54,760
Scott: yeah, what if there's like a little bit of electricity on the wire?

425
00:28:54,821 --> 00:28:57,020
Scott: What if there's too much electricity on the wire whoa?

426
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:05,680
Rym: So a nice real simple way because this is basically how most logic works Is that they'll set a voltage like say three volts or nine volts?

427
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,583
Scott: I think it's five.

428
00:29:06,603 --> 00:29:06,864
Scott: is the?

429
00:29:06,964 --> 00:29:09,113
Scott: is the basically what people go on these days.

430
00:29:09,254 --> 00:29:16,669
Rym: Yeah, though networking and telephony Yeah, but they'll say like if the voltage is three or greater Then it is a one.

431
00:29:17,474 --> 00:29:22,687
Rym: if the voltage well We're not going to talk about polarity if it's three if it's greater than three It's a one if it's less than three.

432
00:29:22,707 --> 00:29:28,580
Scott: It's a zero yep, and sometimes There'll be a buffer zone in the middle and sometimes there'll be all kinds of other crazy stuff.

433
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:35,749
Scott: But all you have to know is that you have a wire and if there's electricity coming down the wire at certain voltage It's one and if there's no electricity.

434
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:36,532
Scott: That's a zero.

435
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:40,969
Rym: and the electricity I mean It's an analog wave going down the wire.

436
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:50,448
Rym: so it can be all over the place and these thresholds To convert that into ones and zeros and they can be done perfectly Mm-hmm because it's all logic.

437
00:29:50,468 --> 00:29:55,047
Rym: at that point you say once you say I'm going to define This as a one that's a one.

438
00:29:55,067 --> 00:29:57,837
Rym: that is a mathematical one because you defined it.

439
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,693
Scott: yep I think most computers today work on five volts.

440
00:30:01,854 --> 00:30:04,546
Scott: tell someone tell me if I'm wrong It's five volts.

441
00:30:04,828 --> 00:30:07,179
Scott: You know is is one and zero volts is zero.

442
00:30:07,702 --> 00:30:14,229
Scott: Yeah, well negative five because we are not going to give you a lesson on Physics and electronics and all that business.

443
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:19,298
Rym: well actually I will but only when I talk about networking Because I because I actually know a lot about that.

444
00:30:20,223 --> 00:30:22,934
Scott: Yeah, but this is how a computer works not how you know.

445
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:23,195
Scott: we're not.

446
00:30:23,215 --> 00:30:29,119
Scott: we're gonna talk about transistors We're not gonna talk about resistors and capacitors and diodes and all that business.

447
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:34,258
Scott: Okay, so now you have a wire with a one coming out of it.

448
00:30:35,262 --> 00:30:36,848
Scott: How do you make this compute?

449
00:30:37,129 --> 00:30:40,260
Scott: well the magic of the transistor?

450
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:47,520
Rym: That that well even before the transistor we had vacuum tubes and before that we had digital logic.

451
00:30:48,282 --> 00:30:52,494
Scott: Yep now the vacuum tube and the transistor perform the same function.

452
00:30:52,755 --> 00:30:58,551
Scott: the transistor is just Much much smaller and much much more efficient than the vacuum tube.

453
00:30:58,591 --> 00:31:03,927
Scott: the vacuum tube is big real big and real dangerous Now real real.

454
00:31:04,007 --> 00:31:12,137
Rym: simply all the transistor does is let you Look, it'll a signal will come in and as a result the output will change.

455
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:14,289
Rym: yep That's in the simplest terms.

456
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:15,658
Rym: That's what a transistor does for you.

457
00:31:16,603 --> 00:31:18,108
Rym: So say the picture has.

458
00:31:18,289 --> 00:31:31,683
Rym: you've three prongs coming out a little thingy and You've got a circuit that's connected to two of those and then another wire connected to the third one And then when you put a signal to the third wire it lets something go through the other two Mm-hmm.

459
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:37,328
Scott: so here's an example That probably should make sense with an analogy and all that.

460
00:31:38,089 --> 00:31:43,960
Scott: all right you have a light bulb you have a battery and You have a transistor.

461
00:31:45,105 --> 00:31:53,319
Scott: You have two batteries two batteries a light bulb Transistor fanatical devotion to the Pope fanatical devotion to the Pope and some wires.

462
00:31:54,981 --> 00:31:58,492
Scott: There's a wire from one battery to input prong.

463
00:31:58,512 --> 00:32:03,037
Scott: one is a wire from the output prong.

464
00:32:04,224 --> 00:32:05,792
Rym: I don't know how well this is gonna work without a picture.

465
00:32:06,013 --> 00:32:07,480
Scott: Yeah, we really need a picture.

466
00:32:07,781 --> 00:32:08,363
Rym: Maybe we should choose.

467
00:32:08,663 --> 00:32:10,168
Rym: you're not gonna do a video cast on this?

468
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:12,889
Scott: no we're not Okay.

469
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:25,489
Scott: So there's electricity going in one prong and electricity coming from that prong goes through the transistor and out the third prong To the light bulb and then you make a circuit all the way around so that the light bulb actually lights up.

470
00:32:26,752 --> 00:32:29,300
Scott: The middle prong is the control prong.

471
00:32:29,923 --> 00:32:39,331
Scott: so if the middle prong is off The light bulb goes off because it doesn't the transistor won't let the electricity go through the transistor to from the battery to the light Bulb.

472
00:32:40,134 --> 00:32:48,729
Scott: if you turn the middle prong on the control prong on Then it allows the electricity to go through to the light bulb and light bulb turns on.

473
00:32:49,613 --> 00:32:54,275
Scott: So this is zero on the control prong No light bulb zero.

474
00:32:55,159 --> 00:32:55,540
Scott: a one.

475
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:58,373
Scott: on the control prong up light bulb goes on It's a one.

476
00:32:58,998 --> 00:33:11,850
Rym: now all your computer is is billions and billions and billions of those all turning lights on and off on and off on and off all over the place and those Lights turn on other lights the turn on other lights in this cascading chain that collapses into an answer for every given input.

477
00:33:12,163 --> 00:33:17,984
Scott: Yep Now imagine this you have a room with a light bulb and there's one switch on the wall.

478
00:33:18,585 --> 00:33:20,169
Scott: off is zero on is one.

479
00:33:21,395 --> 00:33:31,850
Scott: Now let's say you have two Switches and you have two light bulbs.

480
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:35,273
Scott: Zero one Zero one.

481
00:33:35,293 --> 00:33:36,016
Scott: Yeah.

482
00:33:36,197 --> 00:33:48,970
Rym: Yeah now at this point if you didn't pay attention in high school math And you don't know about non 10 base numbers Real briefly base 10 the numbers we use you know one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven.

483
00:33:49,336 --> 00:33:50,232
Rym: That's base 10.

484
00:33:50,232 --> 00:33:51,471
Rym: It's in sets of 10.

485
00:33:51,471 --> 00:33:58,310
Rym: That's the numbering system humans use for a variety of reasons because there are 10 digits in base 10 and because we have 10 fingers.

486
00:33:58,631 --> 00:34:04,237
Rym: You know, yep, there's a lot of reasons why humans ended up using base 10 and there were some cultures that used other bases Mm-hmm.

487
00:34:04,479 --> 00:34:05,390
Rym: They mostly disappeared.

488
00:34:06,072 --> 00:34:17,324
Scott: there is also base 8 which is octal in which the only digits you have at your disposal are 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and The one you'll see most often in computing is hex hexadecimal base 16.

489
00:34:17,324 --> 00:34:23,833
Scott: You have 0 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9 ABCDEF at your disposal 16 digits.

490
00:34:24,054 --> 00:34:27,909
Rym: now the only reason hex is used is really an octal isn't used so much anymore.

491
00:34:28,251 --> 00:34:32,909
Rym: But hex is a convenient way of just of writing binary.

492
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:38,402
Scott: Binary is base 2. you have two digits 0 and 1.

493
00:34:38,402 --> 00:34:56,449
Rym: so counting in binary goes 0 1 10 11 100 101 110 111 a thousand and That's the same as counting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9. now obviously you need a lot of Bits a lot of digits to write a large number in binary.

494
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,070
Scott: This is all just different ways of writing numbers.

495
00:34:59,271 --> 00:35:09,466
Scott: You know if you want to write the number 16 you write 1 6. if you want to write the number 16 and hexadecimal you write F. It's the same F. Just is 16.

496
00:35:09,466 --> 00:35:10,650
Scott: It's a different way of writing a number.

497
00:35:11,271 --> 00:35:11,893
Scott: That's all it is.

498
00:35:12,335 --> 00:35:16,908
Scott: So writing 7 or in binary is what.

499
00:35:16,988 --> 00:35:17,289
Scott: let's see.

500
00:35:18,791 --> 00:35:19,233
Scott: See how it.

501
00:35:19,253 --> 00:35:23,889
Scott: see why you need hex because I already have to think it's 0 1 1 1. there you go.

502
00:35:24,391 --> 00:35:29,565
Rym: Because now just I have a little chart cuz way way back and I was a freshman at RIT.

503
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:39,377
Rym: the hex to binary chart yeah, like my first computer class at RIT like the first ever when I learned about a computer from anyone who actually knew what they Were talking about.

504
00:35:39,478 --> 00:35:40,589
Rym: and we learned all about.

505
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:44,649
Rym: You know binary logic and all that which was really simple and I knew some of it already.

506
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:54,888
Rym: But my first programming project was we had to write all these number base converters and logic converters and all these things in Visual basic, but we weren't allowed to use any of the functions.

507
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,188
Rym: So we had to do it all manually by hand.

508
00:35:57,711 --> 00:36:01,147
Rym: So I made a little chart of binary hexadecimal octal and suck it on my monitor.

509
00:36:01,348 --> 00:36:01,830
Scott: That's good one.

510
00:36:02,011 --> 00:36:05,089
Rym: It's still stuck there to this day because I'd never bothered it to get rid of it.

511
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:10,950
Scott: Now the reason we use hex because it's so easy is because four binary digits is a hex digit.

512
00:36:11,491 --> 00:36:12,093
Scott: Think about it.

513
00:36:12,414 --> 00:36:15,481
Scott: four binary digits that means four zeros and ones.

514
00:36:15,662 --> 00:36:20,416
Scott: so that's every number from zero zero zero zero to One one one one.

515
00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:24,632
Scott: Well one one one one is 16.

516
00:36:24,632 --> 00:36:27,239
Rym: That means on one one one one is 15 sky 15.

517
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:28,583
Scott: That doesn't matter.

518
00:36:28,803 --> 00:36:29,846
Scott: It's the 16th digit.

519
00:36:30,367 --> 00:36:31,330
Scott: The zero is in there.

520
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,515
Scott: Yeah, zero zero zero zero.

521
00:36:32,555 --> 00:36:35,790
Rym: Yeah, here's another nice aside for all of you non computer types.

522
00:36:36,131 --> 00:36:40,310
Rym: You might notice that a lot of because that's why I didn't correct Scott earlier when you said F is 16.

523
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:51,213
Rym: Yeah, a lot of computer people especially computer programmers more so than IT people when they tell you a number relating computers They might always be one-off from you Because do.

524
00:36:52,156 --> 00:36:55,366
Rym: for various reasons a lot of computer people start counting with zero.

525
00:36:55,466 --> 00:36:56,750
Scott: You always start counting with zero.

526
00:36:57,292 --> 00:37:01,127
Rym: Yeah, but normal people don't do that in the real world in their normal life.

527
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:01,790
Scott: No, they don't.

528
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:02,896
Scott: I was trying to make it stupid.

529
00:37:02,936 --> 00:37:03,459
Scott: But yeah.

530
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,490
Scott: Yeah, I guess we'll make it a little less stupid.

531
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:12,110
Rym: I was just be wary of that because The more you deal with computers, especially if you start writing code, that's where it'll really appear.

532
00:37:12,652 --> 00:37:14,802
Rym: Just remember that zero is the first number.

533
00:37:15,304 --> 00:37:15,525
Scott: Yep.

534
00:37:15,585 --> 00:37:21,123
Rym: Zero is one But it's not one because it means zero but it's also just a number.

535
00:37:21,143 --> 00:37:23,450
Scott: Yeah, it's the first number is zero.

536
00:37:24,232 --> 00:37:26,941
Scott: So one one one one is 15.

537
00:37:26,941 --> 00:37:28,848
Scott: F is 15 zero zero zero.

538
00:37:28,868 --> 00:37:31,068
Scott: zero is zero Zero is zero.

539
00:37:31,953 --> 00:37:51,230
Scott: So you with four binary digits four zeros and ones you can do Every single hex digit zero through F. So if you take any binary number or just a series of zeros and ones break it up into groups of four You can easily convert it into hex and vice versa.

540
00:37:51,793 --> 00:38:00,630
Scott: That's why computer programmers and people always write things in hex Because to write it in binary would be incredibly long and writing in hex is four times shorter.

541
00:38:01,755 --> 00:38:05,381
Rym: Now you might be wondering at this point All right, so I have my light bulb switch and that works.

542
00:38:05,421 --> 00:38:06,667
Rym: now my two light bulb switches.

543
00:38:06,708 --> 00:38:07,150
Rym: that works.

544
00:38:08,031 --> 00:38:09,214
Scott: How do I have your numbers?

545
00:38:09,575 --> 00:38:11,220
Rym: How do I do things with that?

546
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:14,410
Rym: Because I mean the switches it's just binary numbers.

547
00:38:15,038 --> 00:38:21,329
Rym: So say, you know Say you want to add two binary numbers or subtract two or do something to the binary numbers to get some answer out.

548
00:38:22,611 --> 00:38:28,370
Rym: It seems like it'd be really complicated to make a different combination of switches for every possible input.

549
00:38:29,118 --> 00:38:41,287
Rym: No, you don't have to yep The fact that turns out that there is a very small set of logical operators in binary That together can be used to make any logical situation you can describe in binary.

550
00:38:41,307 --> 00:38:44,809
Rym: Mm-hmm I don't know if we're gonna talk about them in great detail tonight.

551
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:47,278
Rym: probably not but very briefly.

552
00:38:47,298 --> 00:39:08,110
Rym: and if you want to get ahead of us and Nand or X or not You can also combine them to be like not X or or Nor and if you keep combining them you get very complex circuits that can do things like addition and subtraction and primary factorization.

553
00:39:09,611 --> 00:39:12,185
Scott: Yep now for the.

554
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:14,318
Scott: We're gonna finish it off right here.

555
00:39:14,922 --> 00:39:16,090
Rym: I think we should wrap it up a little bit.

556
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:21,474
Rym: I don't want to go too long the first time because I'd really like to get some feedback from all our listeners on is They understood it.

557
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:22,339
Rym: Yeah, is the pace?

558
00:39:22,399 --> 00:39:23,304
Rym: Okay, should we speed up?

559
00:39:23,345 --> 00:39:24,169
Rym: Should we slow down?

560
00:39:24,572 --> 00:39:25,860
Rym: Is that too much for one day?

561
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:31,269
Scott: All right, so here's the final example I want you to put in your minds and then I'm gonna have a mini trivia question.

562
00:39:31,651 --> 00:39:34,526
Rym: Oh a trivia question just a little mini one to kind of keep people interested.

563
00:39:34,768 --> 00:39:35,009
Scott: Okay?

564
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,876
Scott: Imagine this in your minds.

565
00:39:38,257 --> 00:39:40,705
Scott: There are four light bulbs doo-doo.

566
00:39:41,026 --> 00:39:42,350
Scott: No forget the four light bulbs.

567
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:58,158
Scott: there's a calculator screen right and the calculator screen has four wires going into it, right and What the calculator screen will do is if all ones come into it on Each of the four wires.

568
00:39:58,339 --> 00:40:03,044
Scott: if there's electricity in all four wires then the letter F will appear on the calculator screen.

569
00:40:03,245 --> 00:40:04,028
Scott: you see where I'm going.

570
00:40:04,049 --> 00:40:09,608
Scott: and If there's no electricity in none of the wires, then the number zero will go there.

571
00:40:10,532 --> 00:40:13,442
Scott: Now the four wires aren't just going to four switches.

572
00:40:13,523 --> 00:40:15,450
Scott: You can make any number you want appear.

573
00:40:16,295 --> 00:40:25,368
Scott: they're going into two separate sets of switches and You see you set one set of switches to be one number and the other set of switches to be another number.

574
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:38,083
Scott: and then there's a bunch of those ands and nans and stuff in between that we talked about and It adds the first number you put together And the second number you put together and the result shows up on the screen.

575
00:40:38,544 --> 00:40:40,290
Rym: now note that there's only four wires.

576
00:40:40,952 --> 00:40:43,600
Rym: Then you're limited to F. It's the highest number you can reach.

577
00:40:43,921 --> 00:40:48,463
Rym: Yeah, if you try to add seven and a No, not gonna work.

578
00:40:48,767 --> 00:40:53,849
Rym: and Depending on how I mean if you just have the circuit there It'll work and it'll give you an answer.

579
00:40:54,291 --> 00:40:58,458
Rym: but it'll give you the wrong answer because it's like imagine if you were doing a an addition.

580
00:40:58,518 --> 00:41:05,930
Rym: right you're adding a bunch of numbers together and Say you only have eight spaces on your little piece of paper for the answer, but the answer uses nine digits.

581
00:41:06,492 --> 00:41:09,142
Rym: You just chop off the one on the end and now your answer is totally wrong.

582
00:41:09,182 --> 00:41:11,030
Scott: Yeah, the idea is you don't put more input.

583
00:41:12,031 --> 00:41:17,808
Scott: You don't give the per the user enough input to overflow yeah and on a hardware level you make you just.

584
00:41:17,868 --> 00:41:19,936
Rym: you know You know that all right.

585
00:41:20,036 --> 00:41:23,570
Rym: I have X wires, so I can't ever do anything that needs more than X wires.

586
00:41:24,591 --> 00:41:24,732
Rym: Mm-hmm.

587
00:41:24,993 --> 00:41:29,710
Rym: of course you can do fancy things like well say I have two sets of X wires or four sets X wires.

588
00:41:30,031 --> 00:41:31,196
Rym: I'll use two of those sets now.

589
00:41:31,236 --> 00:41:34,490
Rym: I can store twice as much, but now I'm using two of my sets.

590
00:41:34,651 --> 00:41:35,797
Scott: Yeah, so it would probably be.

591
00:41:35,817 --> 00:41:51,870
Scott: there are four wires going into the display But there are three wires on the left and three wires on the right, so if you turn them all on it would be Seven and seven which is 14. if you turn them if you turn one side off it would be seven.

592
00:41:54,042 --> 00:41:56,800
Rym: So I hope this is enlighten any people a little bit.

593
00:41:56,861 --> 00:42:00,652
Rym: We really want to get a lot of feedback And we'll try to fine-tune this series as we go on.

594
00:42:00,713 --> 00:42:02,160
Rym: since this is the inaugural episode.

595
00:42:02,682 --> 00:42:05,654
Scott: Yeah, next time we'll probably talk about the actual gates.

596
00:42:06,035 --> 00:42:11,960
Scott: Yeah digital logic and Then we'll probably make a big jump over a bunch of really complicated stuff.

597
00:42:12,001 --> 00:42:20,731
Scott: That's in between But we'll try to abstract it so you can make the connection all the way up to where the assembly Programming is which is what you got to jump to.

598
00:42:21,073 --> 00:42:28,738
Rym: plus we can always go back once We've gone over larger broader ideas and fill in very specific details, especially if people are curious about them.

599
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:38,620
Rym: yep Yep now my trivia, and this is I think every time we do this I'll have a trivia that's basically going to be answered in the next episode regardless of whether any you figure it out.

600
00:42:38,883 --> 00:42:40,059
Scott: Are you gonna give a prize?

601
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,186
Rym: No, no prize.

602
00:42:41,247 --> 00:42:42,360
Rym: This is just for your own.

603
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:46,505
Rym: This is the kind of thing where if you go out and find the answer You'll be ahead of the game.

604
00:42:46,546 --> 00:42:48,374
Rym: You'll have a better idea of what we're talking about.

605
00:42:48,414 --> 00:42:52,814
Rym: on the next one okay now I mentioned all those gates you know and or X or NAND and not.

606
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:54,080
Scott: oh, this is a good one.

607
00:42:54,401 --> 00:42:55,083
Scott: Why are we gonna ask?

608
00:42:55,284 --> 00:42:57,412
Rym: I think you do know what I'm gonna ask now.

609
00:42:58,134 --> 00:43:01,485
Rym: each one of them can be made With or without a transistor.

610
00:43:01,546 --> 00:43:06,140
Rym: you can make all of those gates with just wires and switches.

611
00:43:07,004 --> 00:43:08,530
Rym: You can also make them with transistors.

612
00:43:09,113 --> 00:43:25,860
Rym: now of all of them one of them is electrically the simplest to make and the most versatile and It is the one that you can with this logical operator make by combinations of certain numbers of this operator any other one of the operators.

613
00:43:26,981 --> 00:43:33,661
Rym: Now most chips that people buy especially hobbyist known RadioShack you buy like a little IC chip that you stick in a board and fiddle With.

614
00:43:33,681 --> 00:43:37,836
Scott: yeah, it's one of those black rectangles all little bits coming out of it on the sides.

615
00:43:37,896 --> 00:43:38,699
Scott: It looks like a little bug.

616
00:43:39,621 --> 00:43:41,426
Scott: Those actually have a shit ton of gates in them.

617
00:43:41,607 --> 00:43:41,787
Scott: yep

618
00:43:42,248 --> 00:43:58,880
Rym: now the thing is most of those chips only include one gate and in fact most simple chips out in the world are comprised entirely of one and only one kind of gate and They combine that one kind of gate to make all the different gates because it's easier electronically to do that.

619
00:43:59,582 --> 00:44:02,970
Rym: So my question is what is that universal gate that everyone uses?

620
00:44:03,071 --> 00:44:03,632
Rym: which one?

621
00:44:04,374 --> 00:44:06,359
Rym: and NAND not X or or?

622
00:44:07,501 --> 00:44:15,337
Scott: Yep, they're or or Only the simplest electronics that are out there use you know all the different kinds of gates.

623
00:44:15,538 --> 00:44:24,687
Scott: all the complex electronics in the world use One gate only one gate because you have so many gates at that point It's more efficient now.

624
00:44:24,748 --> 00:44:24,868
Rym: now.

625
00:44:24,949 --> 00:44:30,370
Rym: We may be wrong about some of the crazy new processors Because people do some interesting things with electricity nowadays.

626
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:31,072
Scott: Yeah, they do.

627
00:44:31,273 --> 00:44:33,118
Rym: these are things you don't need to care about mm-hmm.

628
00:44:34,292 --> 00:44:58,148
Rym: but anyway That is my question and really give us some feedback on this because we'll try to go in whatever direction you guys want and cater To whatever you want to learn Mm-hmm and maybe our ideal sue us for giving it away for free Haha, and that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

629
00:44:58,188 --> 00:45:00,210
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for our opening theme.

630
00:45:00,673 --> 00:45:05,097
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontrowcrew.com.

631
00:45:05,739 --> 00:45:08,207
Scott: if you like our podcast you'll love our forums.

632
00:45:08,287 --> 00:45:08,989
Scott: make sure you visit them.

633
00:45:09,572 --> 00:45:15,659
Scott: You can send your email feedback to GeekNights at gmail.com And if you want you can leave us a voicemail at 206-333-1537.

634
00:45:20,393 --> 00:45:23,130
Rym: GeekNights airs every weeknight Monday through Thursday.

635
00:45:23,812 --> 00:45:29,306
Scott: GeekNights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience, but unlike those other talk shows.

636
00:45:29,687 --> 00:45:30,930
Scott: It's actually recorded at night.
