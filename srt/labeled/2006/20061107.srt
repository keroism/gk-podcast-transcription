1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,638
Scott: It's Tuesday November 7th.

2
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Scott: I'm Scott and I'm Rym and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:15,672 --> 00:00:19,180
Scott: Tonight we discussed the awesome board game Ultraman.

4
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:24,552
Scott: Let's do this Today.

5
00:00:24,632 --> 00:00:29,230
Rym: I interacted with the federal government in the only legal way I have to change the federal government.

6
00:00:29,993 --> 00:00:33,587
Scott: I did so as well a few minutes prior to you doing so.

7
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:34,430
Rym: yeah, it was funny.

8
00:00:34,511 --> 00:00:38,445
Rym: I drove home from work And I kind of went the back mountain way because that goes right into beacon.

9
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:43,630
Rym: so I could stop and vote On the way home and sure enough I get there to vote and I see Scott about four people ahead of me in line.

10
00:00:44,432 --> 00:00:45,644
Scott: Yeah, it was kind of annoying.

11
00:00:45,724 --> 00:00:52,284
Scott: last time I didn't know what ward and district I was in and I had a little map and I just found myself on the map and I found out that I was in.

12
00:00:52,325 --> 00:00:57,002
Scott: I think Like district 3 Ward 1 or Ward 1 district 3.

13
00:00:57,002 --> 00:00:59,975
Scott: I forget what or which one is Ward 3 district 1.

14
00:00:59,975 --> 00:01:01,327
Scott: It's 3 - 1. that's all I got to know.

15
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:04,357
Scott: But this time they didn't have the map.

16
00:01:04,638 --> 00:01:07,588
Scott: so it was really kind of hectic and people had to keep at.

17
00:01:07,688 --> 00:01:08,612
Scott: there had to be Someone.

18
00:01:08,653 --> 00:01:11,570
Scott: they're telling you which frickin voting machine to use.

19
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:12,632
Scott: Annoying.

20
00:01:12,933 --> 00:01:16,650
Rym: you see I walked in and there was a lady standing at the door, and she said what's your address?

21
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:18,014
Rym: And I said my address.

22
00:01:18,034 --> 00:01:20,087
Scott: that lady wasn't at the door when I got there.

23
00:01:20,127 --> 00:01:20,530
Rym: good game.

24
00:01:20,813 --> 00:01:30,964
Rym: Yeah, though more importantly There's a proposition up for vote in beacon that I have feelings about and it seems like all the hippies in town and old people Have opposite feelings about.

25
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:32,453
Rym: yeah It's this thing about.

26
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:43,690
Rym: the city wants to borrow a million dollars in order to buy a bunch of land so developers can't develop on It and I don't want to get into how stupid this thing actually was and it's not at all a good idea.

27
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:51,944
Rym: but the point is old people and hippies are really for it and It's almost all old people local volunteers running the election.

28
00:01:51,964 --> 00:02:02,230
Scott: Yeah, there was one semi young lady who looked like someone's mom and There was some other lady, but everyone else was a senior citizen usually female.

29
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,689
Rym: Well, there's that one black lady who seemed to be the head official at this event.

30
00:02:06,272 --> 00:02:07,498
Rym: Okay, she knew what she was doing.

31
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:09,770
Rym: she was telling people what to do and directing everything.

32
00:02:10,059 --> 00:02:10,389
Scott: That's cool.

33
00:02:10,912 --> 00:02:16,129
Rym: And I noticed while I was standing in line that a few of the old people kept mentioning to people right before they walked in.

34
00:02:16,992 --> 00:02:34,590
Rym: don't forget to vote for the proposition at the top and They were really phrasing it in a way to try to get people to vote yes, and finally that this election official notices this and Starts yelling at one of the old ladies about how what she's doing is a violation of federal law and all sorts of things.

35
00:02:34,691 --> 00:02:35,416
Rym: She's gonna kick her out.

36
00:02:35,436 --> 00:02:36,221
Rym: She doesn't stop it.

37
00:02:36,463 --> 00:02:37,490
Rym: She's influencing the vote.

38
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:45,902
Rym: It's a terrible thing to do and the lady got all kind of indignant and I saw her talking with all the other old ladies A few minutes later while I was still in line about.

39
00:02:46,485 --> 00:02:47,510
Rym: she shouldn't tell me what to do.

40
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:56,901
Scott: I can tell people how to vote if I want and yeah, there's nothing I can't stand more than people being indignant Even if they're right, it's like don't be indignant god damn it.

41
00:02:57,182 --> 00:02:59,670
Rym: Yeah, I got stories about indignant people.

42
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:01,876
Rym: I should probably save all of them.

43
00:03:02,217 --> 00:03:08,574
Scott: You know, there's not short of just outright evil people like crazy Genocidal killers.

44
00:03:09,317 --> 00:03:12,648
Scott: I think the number one personality trait I dislike is indignancy.

45
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:17,030
Rym: now remember There's a fine line between asserting your rights and being indignant.

46
00:03:17,592 --> 00:03:20,962
Rym: We could probably do a whole Thursday describing exactly what the differences are.

47
00:03:21,303 --> 00:03:23,790
Scott: We probably could but that's besides the point.

48
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:34,230
Rym: Yeah, I think the most indignant person I ever saw in my life Was waiting in line to get over the Lewiston bridge into Canada on my way home for the holidays many years ago.

49
00:03:34,952 --> 00:03:39,610
Scott: You know, I think I don't like indignancies because it's the exact opposite of personal responsibility.

50
00:03:39,631 --> 00:03:46,890
Scott: You know You're either saying I didn't do anything wrong when you did or or you're saying it's okay for me to do something wrong.

51
00:03:47,011 --> 00:03:48,096
Scott: You know, no one can tell.

52
00:03:48,117 --> 00:03:49,745
Scott: you know, everything I do is perfect.

53
00:03:49,926 --> 00:03:52,700
Scott: Yeah Yeah, no one can tell me anything.

54
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:53,483
Rym: It's always the.

55
00:03:53,704 --> 00:04:02,310
Rym: you're not the boss of me Yeah, but yeah at least luckily I'm pretty sure our votes got counted because there's no d-bold anywhere near our election.

56
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:07,210
Scott: No, we use my favorite style of voting machine, which is sadly when I was a kid.

57
00:04:07,592 --> 00:04:11,190
Scott: These are the kind of voting machines that were used in my town and I'm pretty sure they still are.

58
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,990
Rym: They're the ones that were used back where I grew up because I remember going in with my mom when she voted.

59
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:20,410
Scott: Okay, not only are they incredibly fun to vote in but I don't see how they're so fun.

60
00:04:20,571 --> 00:04:29,228
Scott: You get to pull this lever and a curtain closes behind you and then you go click click click click And then you put lever again I could make a lever that closed the curtains if you wanted.

61
00:04:29,249 --> 00:04:35,240
Rym: dude I would sit there all day pulling the lever put a bunch of buttons on it with different names next to the buttons and Don't do that.

62
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:35,929
Scott: I'll be in trouble.

63
00:04:36,733 --> 00:04:37,401
Scott: We'll go to work.

64
00:04:37,623 --> 00:04:48,690
Scott: Yeah No, but the other thing about this machine that I never actually realized before because they never paid attention Is that you can't pull the lever unless the election official pushes a button on the outside of the machine?

65
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:58,330
Scott: So if you try to go into the machine and like pull the lever vote Pull the lever two times and vote again It won't work because you won't be able to put lever be until the person on the outside pushes a button.

66
00:04:58,853 --> 00:05:01,690
Rym: Now it seemed that there were really two kinds of people voting.

67
00:05:02,393 --> 00:05:09,320
Rym: I noticed a lot of people who I'm pretty sure had never voted before or something because you know Most people would get in line and you know, they'd be their turn.

68
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,318
Rym: they walk in they pull the lever and then they unpull the lever Like a minute later.

69
00:05:13,499 --> 00:05:13,961
Rym: at most.

70
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:15,370
Scott: I think they're just slow.

71
00:05:15,711 --> 00:05:29,084
Rym: No, no, no, but some people would walk in and kind of stand there not really sure what to do And they try to move a lever like not the lever But the voting switches they wouldn't move and they tap at it and they look around.

72
00:05:29,104 --> 00:05:32,344
Rym: then by then the election official walk around And pull the lever for him to shut the curtain.

73
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:40,257
Scott: Yep I think it's just that a lot of people aren't smart and even if they do it every year every few years It's like they don't remember how the stupid thing works.

74
00:05:40,277 --> 00:05:42,264
Scott: They just can't figure out machines at all.

75
00:05:42,585 --> 00:05:44,290
Scott: Like Lewis Black said he's not mechanical.

76
00:05:44,371 --> 00:05:47,330
Rym: There's a big sign right next to the lever.

77
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:51,282
Rym: It says pull lever to these people who barely make selections.

78
00:05:51,523 --> 00:05:55,033
Rym: when finished pull lever in opposite direction Curtain will open.

79
00:05:55,174 --> 00:05:56,598
Scott: these people are barely literate.

80
00:05:56,618 --> 00:05:57,862
Scott: You can't expect too much from them.

81
00:05:58,082 --> 00:05:58,423
Rym: Luckily.

82
00:05:58,463 --> 00:06:00,550
Rym: The machine doesn't let you fuck up.

83
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:02,259
Rym: Yeah vote for too many people.

84
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:09,386
Scott: Yeah, if you try to vote for like You know a for governor and also vote for B for governor you click down.

85
00:06:09,467 --> 00:06:10,430
Scott: BA pops up.

86
00:06:10,651 --> 00:06:12,726
Scott: This machine is perfect in every way for voting.

87
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:13,250
Scott: It's awesome.

88
00:06:13,531 --> 00:06:17,710
Scott: The thing is the company that makes these machines has been out of business for as long as I have lived.

89
00:06:17,831 --> 00:06:31,490
Scott: I think like I remember when I would be like in kindergarten I go to vote with my mom and they would talk about how these machines are no longer made and no one knew how to maintain them or anything But they still work because they're so awesome and purely mechanical computers.

90
00:06:31,912 --> 00:06:36,470
Rym: It's just kind of like the difference in the state of voting in America at this point bothers me a lot.

91
00:06:36,571 --> 00:06:45,010
Rym: I mean I saw a survey recently that a Very large number of Americans have no confidence at all that their votes are actually counted properly anymore.

92
00:06:45,612 --> 00:06:51,130
Scott: Yeah, I have confidence in that machine because it is a mechanical machine that will function even if the power is out.

93
00:06:51,571 --> 00:06:57,090
Scott: Do I have confidence that the people reading the numbers on those machines will report them correctly and send them to the right place?

94
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:05,270
Rym: Probably I don't think the thing is at least that's so distributed that it would take a lot of people working together To pull off a conspiracy.

95
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:17,470
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, a few places could mess up easily or purposefully screw things up, but it would take a mass crazy Improbable conspiracy to do it everywhere in a significant fashion.

96
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:27,956
Rym: That's how I feel when it comes to Anything that you need to protect like voting or something where there is the chance that someone could do something shady or have a conspiracy Among other people to change the results.

97
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:36,210
Scott: Yeah, like the person who sends the forms to the election whatever for the state Just change, you know, oh no this many people voted for so-and-so.

98
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:47,862
Rym: Yeah well No but my point is that the best way to prevent crazy conspiracies from happening is to involve a Lot of people in the process in incremental menial ways.

99
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:59,329
Rym: that way in order to actually pull off conspiracy you need so many people involved all of whom now have to keep this secret and the more people involved the more likely it is Someone's gonna go to Fox News and tell a story.

100
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:02,223
Scott: I don't think this Fox News is gonna put up the story.

101
00:08:02,585 --> 00:08:08,945
Rym: They would Fox News Remember they may lean to the right, but I don't think that is any part of ideology.

102
00:08:08,965 --> 00:08:10,470
Rym: I think it's simply money.

103
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,880
Rym: Yeah, CNN leans a little bit to the left for money.

104
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:16,850
Rym: BBC leans a little bit toward Britain for money.

105
00:08:18,252 --> 00:08:21,230
Scott: Well, BBC isn't make money because they're funded by the state.

106
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:26,149
Scott: They make money sort of like NPR and PR doesn't do it for the BBC sells DVDs and things.

107
00:08:26,752 --> 00:08:32,350
Scott: Yeah, but that's that's sort of like to you know to get more make it so they have to tax the Britain's less.

108
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:34,337
Scott: Of course, they still tax on the high heaven.

109
00:08:34,398 --> 00:08:36,063
Rym: Anyway, I like how you call them the Britain's.

110
00:08:36,586 --> 00:08:37,630
Scott: what else am I gonna call them?

111
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:38,051
Rym: I don't know.

112
00:08:38,111 --> 00:08:38,693
Rym: United Kingdom.

113
00:08:38,732 --> 00:08:41,602
Scott: errs al Bien ers al Bien ites.

114
00:08:41,683 --> 00:08:41,964
Scott: Yeah.

115
00:08:42,205 --> 00:08:42,365
Scott: Yeah.

116
00:08:42,385 --> 00:08:43,770
Rym: All right, so do we got in the news?

117
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:59,380
Scott: So muzzah city mother three for those of you who don't speak crazy Scott aka earthbound 3 because if you don't know there's a game called earthbound, which is an awesome RPG That came out in Japan for the NES.

118
00:08:59,721 --> 00:09:01,408
Scott: Yeah, it didn't come out in the u.s.

119
00:09:01,428 --> 00:09:02,010
Scott: For the NES.

120
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,740
Rym: It quickly gained a cult following in Japan.

121
00:09:04,981 --> 00:09:07,570
Rym: Yeah, then it came over to America and gained an even larger.

122
00:09:07,671 --> 00:09:08,196
Rym: Well, it didn't.

123
00:09:08,217 --> 00:09:09,450
Scott: the NES didn't come to America.

124
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:10,434
Rym: Oh the SNES one.

125
00:09:10,574 --> 00:09:12,722
Scott: right and that game was called mother the game.

126
00:09:12,762 --> 00:09:18,363
Scott: then there was a game called mother 2 for the SNES And they released that one in the US and they called it earthbound now.

127
00:09:18,403 --> 00:09:18,785
Rym: They're both.

128
00:09:18,945 --> 00:09:20,070
Rym: I mean, they're the same game.

129
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,543
Rym: Effectively just it's on the SNES.

130
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:23,550
Rym: So it's longer and better.

131
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:28,750
Scott: Yeah, the NES one it's good to go look at it just to see but there's no point in playing it.

132
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,301
Rym: You know what play it because the first five minutes are great.

133
00:09:31,341 --> 00:09:32,084
Rym: You're a little kid.

134
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:33,250
Scott: There's no point in playing the whole thing.

135
00:09:33,551 --> 00:09:34,013
Rym: Well, I don't know.

136
00:09:34,034 --> 00:09:34,556
Rym: It's a fun game.

137
00:09:34,576 --> 00:09:35,300
Scott: The NES one.

138
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:40,889
Rym: Yeah, I played through a good half of it Maybe but you start in a room and then you hear weird noises.

139
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:48,821
Rym: So you try to walk over to your door and suddenly the lamp on the table that you thought was a background item Just suddenly jumps out and attacks your ass.

140
00:09:48,861 --> 00:09:50,710
Scott: It's funny because you get on the street you fight hippies.

141
00:09:51,011 --> 00:09:54,130
Scott: Yeah, like literally it looks like a hippie and it says the word hippie.

142
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,962
Rym: But yeah earthbound is where Ness came from.

143
00:09:57,083 --> 00:10:00,058
Rym: for those of you who aren't so up He played Smash Brothers.

144
00:10:00,078 --> 00:10:02,070
Scott: you seen Ness and you see his little town.

145
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:09,067
Scott: That's earthbound because mother 2 in Japan for the SNES is the same game as earthbound for the SNES in the US.

146
00:10:09,147 --> 00:10:16,190
Rym: now pretty much Immediately after earthbound came out all the cult fans in America were saying is there ever gonna be another one?

147
00:10:16,732 --> 00:10:17,819
Scott: Yeah, cuz it's so awesome.

148
00:10:18,261 --> 00:10:27,670
Scott: now in Japan There is a GBA cartridge for a Game Boy Advance game that contains mother 1 & 2 on a single GBA cartridge.

149
00:10:28,032 --> 00:10:30,628
Scott: This does not exist in the United States bastards.

150
00:10:31,371 --> 00:10:37,869
Scott: About seven months ago a game called mother 3 was released for the Game Boy Advance in Japan.

151
00:10:39,192 --> 00:10:50,222
Scott: It turns out that the odds of mother 3 getting an official English translation and being sold in the United States Are decreasing rapidly and you can you might as well give up on it right now.

152
00:10:50,864 --> 00:10:51,767
Scott: It's it's the end.

153
00:10:51,847 --> 00:10:58,429
Scott: I think the guy says He wouldn't look forward to a mother 3 translation in the immediate future.

154
00:10:59,153 --> 00:11:02,130
Scott: Adding that none of the writers are currently working on one though.

155
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:08,769
Scott: Maybe some of the translators that did not work for him may be in discussion So they haven't even started working on this thing.

156
00:11:08,974 --> 00:11:09,530
Scott: You know what I envision?

157
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:14,190
Scott: If they were doing it they probably would have been working on it already.

158
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:22,364
Rym: My guess and I'll bet that within two years this happens that two years from now or so They'll release a DS cart that has mother 1 2 & 3 on it.

159
00:11:22,886 --> 00:11:31,650
Scott: They got to put this shit I'm telling you I think Virtual console virtual consoles where we're gonna see at least earthbound for the SNES on the virtual console.

160
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:37,090
Scott: Regardless there is a mother 3 fan translation project.

161
00:11:37,512 --> 00:11:38,877
Rym: I'm a big fan of fans lations.

162
00:11:38,937 --> 00:11:49,290
Scott: now what these people are doing is they have a Game Boy Advance Programmer a Game Boy Advance programming is actually pretty not too complicated and they have some translators.

163
00:11:49,892 --> 00:11:54,810
Scott: And what they're doing is they're translating the game then they are creating a patch.

164
00:11:55,272 --> 00:11:58,271
Scott: Not they're not gonna give you the ROM for mother 3.

165
00:11:58,271 --> 00:12:25,929
Scott: They're making a program or a patch that you apply to the ROM from mother 3 Which you get from somewhere else to create a new GBA ROM that is translated mother 3. when you will then Play this ROM in some sort of Game Boy emulator or maybe you'll put it on a GBA flash cart and then put that in your GBA or Maybe you'll turn it into a DS ROM and put that in your DS Flash cart and play it on your DS or who knows what you'll do with it.

166
00:12:26,331 --> 00:12:32,970
Scott: But that is currently your best bet for playing mother 3 in English, but it's not done yet.

167
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,062
Rym: It's cool that they're doing it the same way.

168
00:12:35,082 --> 00:12:54,650
Rym: It used to be done back in the day I mean, I remember when I when emulation started getting really big and I got an SNES emulator that actually worked and I found ROMs for Final Fantasy 5 a game that I've never seen or played or anything and There were people out there who did the same thing for that that they're doing now for mother.

169
00:12:54,710 --> 00:13:01,574
Rym: They made patches that would translate the game and I beat Final Fantasy 5 way way way back because of these awesome people Mm-hmm.

170
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:02,862
Scott: I love me.

171
00:13:02,902 --> 00:13:04,270
Scott: some translation action.

172
00:13:04,491 --> 00:13:07,410
Rym: Yeah, fans who do things like this just for the love of the game?

173
00:13:08,331 --> 00:13:15,166
Scott: It's basically a fan sub of a video game when you think about it Except it's just a lot harder to do than a fan sub of an anime.

174
00:13:15,266 --> 00:13:16,090
Rym: is it's better than that?

175
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,121
Rym: It's more pure in that the way they're doing it.

176
00:13:19,662 --> 00:13:21,790
Rym: It doesn't facilitate you pirating the thing.

177
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:29,627
Scott: It'd be like if fan subbers just released subtitle tracks and you had to go get the Japanese DVD and then put the subtitles attached to it.

178
00:13:29,868 --> 00:13:35,386
Scott: Yeah I Think really what it is is they just want to keep their site from getting shut down?

179
00:13:35,426 --> 00:13:47,048
Scott: and if they do it this way The site won't get shut down and the ROM isn't hard to find Whereas if fan subbers only put out subtitle patches or equivalent it would be pretty hard to find the.

180
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:48,434
Scott: you know The raws.

181
00:13:48,454 --> 00:13:50,890
Rym: I'm not saying that things should change in the anime industry.

182
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:58,614
Rym: I'm just saying that at least You can point at these people and say that we are sure they are doing this purely for the love of the game and not For any other reason.

183
00:13:58,634 --> 00:14:00,640
Scott: I just find it really.

184
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:11,770
Scott: I I continue to fail to understand why There are these obvious and simple ways to make money and these for profit video game companies.

185
00:14:11,931 --> 00:14:13,938
Scott: Do not release games in America.

186
00:14:14,179 --> 00:14:15,585
Scott: Look at every time they've done it.

187
00:14:15,966 --> 00:14:16,910
Scott: Phoenix, right?

188
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:20,139
Rym: Katamari Right would do well at all.

189
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:22,310
Rym: Yeah, and then it's sold out immediately.

190
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:28,418
Scott: All these games that are Japan only They don't bring about in the u.s.

191
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:31,650
Scott: Because I don't know what fucking reason they're just too damn lazy.

192
00:14:32,031 --> 00:14:39,376
Scott: And then when the few times they actually do it's a super mega hit and they make a hajillion dollars Fucking bring every game here.

193
00:14:39,456 --> 00:14:41,202
Scott: Japan should get the fucking shaft.

194
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:42,065
Scott: They don't buy.

195
00:14:42,085 --> 00:14:43,510
Scott: they only buy his freaking RPGs.

196
00:14:43,832 --> 00:14:44,438
Scott: They don't buy all these.

197
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,630
Scott: FPS is in crap.

198
00:14:45,891 --> 00:14:46,734
Rym: Yeah, the people get there.

199
00:14:46,774 --> 00:14:51,190
Rym: barely buy an Xbox 360s over there, but people here want the RPGs more than anything.

200
00:14:51,354 --> 00:14:51,990
Scott: That's what we want.

201
00:14:52,071 --> 00:14:58,489
Scott: Well, I don't necessarily want the RPGs so much But the thing is the RPGs that I might actually buy are the ones we don't get.

202
00:14:59,192 --> 00:15:01,979
Scott: The RPGs that we actually get are the ones I don't care about.

203
00:15:01,999 --> 00:15:06,512
Scott: there are plenty of cool Japanese RPGs that I might possibly Want.

204
00:15:06,913 --> 00:15:11,730
Rym: see what I want are all those Japanese adventure games, which is very different from American adventure games.

205
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,284
Scott: Yeah, it's like a choose your own adventure.

206
00:15:13,365 --> 00:15:16,939
Rym: Not a Just very very complex.

207
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:23,492
Scott: choose your own adventure story kind of I forgot to tell you Dave from Dave and Joel He mentioned quest for glory Really?

208
00:15:23,532 --> 00:15:24,676
Scott: Yeah, he apparently played it.

209
00:15:25,197 --> 00:15:29,933
Scott: Like he said it just like Sutton quest for glory something, but then I was like, aha You know what?

210
00:15:30,374 --> 00:15:33,643
Rym: He is now in my top 50 list of people ever.

211
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,434
Scott: Yeah, cuz not many gonna send him an email You know what?

212
00:15:36,454 --> 00:15:43,230
Rym: In fact, I want to ask all of our listeners out there How many of you out there have actually played more than one quest for glory?

213
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:48,870
Scott: How many who've played any quest for glory game or even heard of one heard of a game called quest for glory?

214
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:54,550
Rym: I mean these are probably some of the greatest games to come out of the 80s and 90s for the PC.

215
00:15:55,093 --> 00:15:57,710
Scott: Like I know of them, but I never actually played them all the way through.

216
00:15:58,113 --> 00:16:08,114
Rym: It seems like many most people haven't played him But everyone who has played him is usually a lot older than me for one and to absolutely love them There's really no middle ground.

217
00:16:08,174 --> 00:16:08,937
Scott: also cool.

218
00:16:09,378 --> 00:16:13,470
Scott: I haven't known any uncool people who knew or played quest for glory.

219
00:16:13,651 --> 00:16:16,870
Rym: I mean, it's kind of like people who played King's Quest even though that was a lot more widespread.

220
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,803
Scott: That was a lot more widespread, but quest for glory even though better.

221
00:16:19,964 --> 00:16:30,274
Rym: now, yeah quest for glory I mean King's Quest games were fun, but they weren't the greatest games Especially later on the the other quest games are much better like Space Quest Police Quest.

222
00:16:30,355 --> 00:16:32,042
Scott: Police Quest is the freaking best quest game.

223
00:16:32,062 --> 00:16:33,347
Rym: Yeah hard as fuck though.

224
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:36,541
Scott: Yeah I only played one of them the one we like it's.

225
00:16:36,601 --> 00:16:41,162
Scott: it's always cool cuz you're in the police station with the elevator To the different floors or you do different stuff.

226
00:16:41,243 --> 00:16:41,886
Scott: It's it's way cool.

227
00:16:42,288 --> 00:16:48,483
Rym: Yeah Yeah, yeah, maybe I'll have to do a show about quest for glory and police quest Just a show about asterisk quest.

228
00:16:48,644 --> 00:16:52,496
Rym: That's a really good idea because Also all those LucasArts adventure games.

229
00:16:52,536 --> 00:16:52,777
Scott: Yes.

230
00:16:53,038 --> 00:16:58,170
Scott: Um, yeah, but yeah, Japanese adventure games are not like LucasArts adventure games.

231
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,340
Scott: They're more like choose your own adventure books kind of like Phoenix, right?

232
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,969
Scott: That's that's like a Japanese adventure game pretty much.

233
00:17:05,035 --> 00:17:15,387
Rym: So I probably don't need to tell all of you this but from my news is very simply that Child's Play the penny arcade charity for children and hospitals has launched for this year.

234
00:17:16,172 --> 00:17:21,849
Scott: Give money to kiddies so that they could play video games before they get sick and possibly die.

235
00:17:22,111 --> 00:17:28,950
Rym: We're not gonna really set up any sort of GeekNights direct fund because penny arcade certainly doesn't need our help now.

236
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:32,290
Scott: We'll put a little banner on our site in case you can't find Child's Play.

237
00:17:32,591 --> 00:17:38,778
Rym: Yeah, but all I want to say is that all of you out there if you can spare it It's really worthwhile to donate to this.

238
00:17:38,898 --> 00:17:42,430
Rym: I have donated every year whatever piddly amount I could afford to donate.

239
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,858
Scott: Yeah, I think I was actually our local hospitals.

240
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:47,446
Scott: The one Rym works at the Montefiore.

241
00:17:47,506 --> 00:17:49,272
Rym: It is in fact one of the hospitals I work at.

242
00:17:49,373 --> 00:17:51,782
Rym: it is actually a very large children's hospital.

243
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:53,650
Rym: I've met many of the children who have been there.

244
00:17:53,776 --> 00:17:57,902
Scott: Yeah anyway I was looking at that because there's two ways you can give to Child's Play.

245
00:17:57,962 --> 00:18:00,878
Scott: way number one is just give money straight up through PayPal.

246
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:05,730
Scott: if you do that Then they just make a big pool of money and they distribute it evenly to all the hospitals.

247
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:20,190
Scott: The other way is you pick a specific hospital and each specific hospital has an Amazon wish list of stuff which might be video games, but also might be toys and other things and You can buy a specific thing for that hospital.

248
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:26,225
Scott: So if you go and look at say Montefiore Hospital and apparently some kid there really wants to play.

249
00:18:26,246 --> 00:18:31,096
Scott: I don't know some GBA Naruto game or something.

250
00:18:31,156 --> 00:18:34,426
Scott: you can specifically buy that game because that's what you want to give them.

251
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:44,630
Rym: in the coming weeks I'm going to try to get in touch with the person at the hospitals I work at who is the contact for this charity and hopefully I'll be able to actually work with this firsthand.

252
00:18:44,771 --> 00:18:49,170
Rym: So I might be able to give you guys a lot more specific information as to what's really needed.

253
00:18:49,732 --> 00:18:54,209
Scott: Yeah, I think I saw in one of the Amazon wish lists a Fisher-Price pirate boat.

254
00:18:54,772 --> 00:18:56,750
Scott: Ooh, I was all about because I was like damn.

255
00:18:56,971 --> 00:19:00,030
Scott: I wish I had that when I was a kid because Fisher-Price Main Street was hot shit.

256
00:19:00,391 --> 00:19:02,940
Scott: But there was no Fisher-Price pirate ship when I was a kid.

257
00:19:03,482 --> 00:19:05,570
Rym: Honestly, I'll probably just donate money this year.

258
00:19:05,851 --> 00:19:06,575
Scott: Yeah, I totally.

259
00:19:06,615 --> 00:19:09,309
Scott: if I had a kid I would totally get the Fisher-Price pirate ship.

260
00:19:11,272 --> 00:19:12,317
Scott: I kind of want it now.

261
00:19:12,358 --> 00:19:13,464
Scott: Maybe let's go to Toys R Us.

262
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:15,112
Rym: I'll get it You want to.

263
00:19:15,132 --> 00:19:16,820
Rym: we might have a little bit.

264
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:18,588
Rym: We might have a free weekend coming up.

265
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:20,255
Scott: Yeah We're not doing anything this weekend.

266
00:19:20,295 --> 00:19:21,942
Scott: quite possibly Oh Noah's.

267
00:19:22,183 --> 00:19:23,870
Rym: so yeah Child's Play is a wonderful thing.

268
00:19:24,091 --> 00:19:25,498
Rym: I recommend you donate to it.

269
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:30,848
Rym: Even if you don't like penny arcade though I don't think there is anyone out there who doesn't like penny arcade.

270
00:19:30,988 --> 00:19:33,867
Scott: Oh, wait I just want to mention the other purpose of Child's Play.

271
00:19:34,008 --> 00:19:47,350
Scott: I think Possibly one of the original purposes was that people are hating the media in general hates a lot on video gamers and as a Stereotype of couch potatoes who are sitting there all degenerate and such not.

272
00:19:47,751 --> 00:19:58,730
Scott: So the part of the point of Child's Play is not just to help children in need because video games help sick Sick children, which they actually do help sick children by distracting them from their pain.

273
00:19:59,613 --> 00:20:10,670
Scott: But it also makes gamers not look like degenerates who sit on the couch all day twiddling their thumbs Even though many of you are many of you are but fight the stereo.

274
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:15,458
Scott: There are enough of us who aren't that we can get hundreds of thousands of dollars together every year.

275
00:20:22,189 --> 00:20:24,938
Rym: things of the day Snaps.

276
00:20:25,365 --> 00:20:25,690
Rym: All right.

277
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:35,432
Rym: So this is called Mario's life and it's it's looks at first glance like one of those You know sad clown flipping flapjacks Licking.

278
00:20:35,452 --> 00:20:40,250
Rym: a girl art house kid in college made this film for a grade film.

279
00:20:40,932 --> 00:20:48,223
Scott: I generally like to watch those movies just because they're different from normal movies But most of them honestly aren't good or entertaining.

280
00:20:48,726 --> 00:20:53,003
Rym: Well, it's really weird It's you know, it starts out like one of those weird kind of.

281
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,730
Rym: oh something's going on.

282
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,519
Rym: This is a an art house film.

283
00:20:56,619 --> 00:20:58,830
Rym: Aha, you know sad music's playing the background.

284
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,472
Rym: This guy's laying in bed staring at a clock blinking 12.

285
00:21:02,472 --> 00:21:17,270
Rym: He gets up and slowly goes through this ritual of getting dressed and then suddenly part of it Is that he puts on a big fake mustache and then the mario 1 music starts playing and he goes about his daily life And it is nothing but hilarious.

286
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:21,562
Scott: so it starts out as an art house movie and then becomes a YouTube movie.

287
00:21:21,763 --> 00:21:26,270
Rym: pretty much my favorite part is when he gets the Star and is invincible.

288
00:21:27,712 --> 00:21:28,596
Scott: Yeah, that's a good part.

289
00:21:29,058 --> 00:21:31,609
Scott: I like the part where he sees Luigi on the bridge.

290
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,356
Rym: Yep Now the cool thing is at the end.

291
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:38,306
Rym: It goes back to the scary crazy sad art house thing.

292
00:21:38,326 --> 00:21:41,238
Rym: Oh Yeah, it's kind of comes full circle.

293
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:44,330
Scott: You think there's some sort of social commentary going on here?

294
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:44,772
Rym: You know what?

295
00:21:44,954 --> 00:21:48,474
Rym: I could make up a whole bunch of social commentary I'll stick with.

296
00:21:49,037 --> 00:21:56,497
Scott: it talks about the escapism of video games and how you know Runaway from our shitty lives into these fantasy worlds and blah blah blah Yeah.

297
00:21:56,951 --> 00:22:03,010
Rym: Or at the same time we play video games so much that while because we're escaping it ends up affecting our real lives.

298
00:22:03,312 --> 00:22:11,770
Rym: We end up living our real life in the escape world And then we live what we see is a fake life in the real world, or maybe it's just a silly video on YouTube?

299
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,037
Rym: Maybe maybe it's pretty funny.

300
00:22:15,077 --> 00:22:15,538
Rym: Check it out.

301
00:22:15,598 --> 00:22:18,448
Rym: It's definitely better than banana spider eating a grub.

302
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:20,192
Scott: Yeah Alright.

303
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:35,287
Scott: so I don't know how many people who know this but there are some karate guys out there and they think that through the power of he or some say she that they can do such things as Knock you out just by touching one part of your body.

304
00:22:35,629 --> 00:22:45,749
Rym: now These people have videos all over the place professing to prove their power where one of them will go up to another one and go like And then the guy will just go and fall over.

305
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:50,710
Scott: Yep, they all some of them are even crazier and they think that they can knock you out without touching you.

306
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:56,049
Scott: They just yell at you or put their hands at you and then you fall over and don't wake up.

307
00:22:56,271 --> 00:22:58,365
Rym: They stand there in kind of a hadouken pose.

308
00:22:58,747 --> 00:23:05,417
Scott: Yeah So one of these guys who thinks he can do this is George Dillman Who is some he is.

309
00:23:05,498 --> 00:23:10,497
Scott: I mean this guy is a badass karate guy and if you tried to fight him He'd probably beat you up.

310
00:23:10,999 --> 00:23:13,590
Scott: He does know real martial arts of fighting.

311
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:21,647
Scott: I don't know cuz he also seems to think he knows crazy martial arts of non-existent like dim bach Yeah, that sort of stuff.

312
00:23:21,687 --> 00:23:32,339
Scott: So National Geographic went and videotaped these guys and in this video, you're gonna see a whole lot of people getting knocked out without being touched.

313
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:40,190
Scott: now pretty much the explanation is By those guys is that this do using his magical ki powers?

314
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:46,694
Scott: The real explanation these people are expecting to be knocked out and they're essentially Suggested to.

315
00:23:46,935 --> 00:23:54,429
Scott: as in the way hypnotism works, which is not a hundred percent Well understood but is well understood enough that there's not ki power.

316
00:23:54,851 --> 00:24:00,268
Rym: Of course many of the people involved are most likely just faking it straight up to not look bad or get embarrassed.

317
00:24:00,709 --> 00:24:16,568
Scott: Yep Now at the end of the video comes the interesting part Which is sort of sad because it's only the last minute of this video and that is where this awesome Science guy comes up and he says alright try to knock me out without touching me and it totally doesn't work

318
00:24:16,769 --> 00:24:17,250
Rym: at all.

319
00:24:17,411 --> 00:24:22,456
Rym: he just stands there with a smirk on his face while the guys like Nothing happens.

320
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,172
Scott: Yep, because it's a Bullshit.

321
00:24:25,493 --> 00:24:26,094
Rym: Yeah, though.

322
00:24:26,134 --> 00:24:26,917
Rym: What's sad?

323
00:24:27,017 --> 00:24:31,470
Rym: What's really sad is this magic karate guys explanation for why it didn't work.

324
00:24:31,852 --> 00:24:34,410
Scott: That is the funny part which I'm not going to spoil.

325
00:24:34,731 --> 00:24:36,036
Scott: That is the reason to watch.

326
00:24:36,056 --> 00:24:42,659
Scott: this video is the very last bit where the karate guy Explains why the science guy wasn't knocked out.

327
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,722
Scott: the other the thick.

328
00:24:43,822 --> 00:24:46,932
Scott: one thing I ain't gonna spoil is that he says he's a non Believer.

329
00:24:47,012 --> 00:24:48,860
Scott: so what if I don't believe I'm gonna be knocked out?

330
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,350
Scott: your magic karate powers don't work then what the hell's the point?

331
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,598
Rym: Yeah, no muggers gonna believe that shit.

332
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:57,015
Scott: and if I believe you can knock me out without touching me I'm not gonna fight you.

333
00:24:57,035 --> 00:24:59,510
Scott: so he's admitting his own power is useless.

334
00:24:59,771 --> 00:25:02,202
Scott: But then he has some other explanations which are hilarious.

335
00:25:02,222 --> 00:25:03,850
Rym: now the way the other explanations go.

336
00:25:04,452 --> 00:25:11,038
Rym: I am now pretty much a hundred percent convinced that the guy isn't just a Misguided guy who thinks he has something cool.

337
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:14,569
Rym: I'm pretty sure he is a straight-up and fully aware charlatan.

338
00:25:15,571 --> 00:25:18,909
Scott: I'm giving it an 80% chance of charlatanism going on here.

339
00:25:19,512 --> 00:25:23,509
Rym: Maybe he'll listen to the show and I'll call in and maybe we can get him to try to do this to us.

340
00:25:24,871 --> 00:25:25,693
Scott: Somehow I doubt it.

341
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:29,003
Scott: I mean he didn't even do it himself for National Geographic.

342
00:25:29,043 --> 00:25:31,190
Scott: He had his top student do it instead of himself.

343
00:25:31,491 --> 00:25:38,014
Rym: Yeah, he'll do it on his own students, but not on you or me, yeah Yeah, right.

344
00:25:38,074 --> 00:25:43,152
Rym: so we decided we'd get back to our board game roots a bit and talk about a board game that we played at Uber con.

345
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:45,878
Scott: the game is called ultra mayor.

346
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:49,127
Scott: Oh L. T. R. E space M. A. R. E.

347
00:25:49,327 --> 00:25:50,390
Rym: I've seen it without the space.

348
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,349
Scott: Yeah, I've also seen it without the space.

349
00:25:52,932 --> 00:25:57,829
Scott: It's also known as merchants of Venice or ultra mayor - merchants of Venice.

350
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:03,145
Scott: Donut confuse this with the other game merchants of Venus, which this is not God.

351
00:26:03,365 --> 00:26:05,010
Rym: Yeah, I'll bet that one came second.

352
00:26:05,813 --> 00:26:06,555
Scott: I have no idea.

353
00:26:06,776 --> 00:26:09,767
Rym: Yeah, it's put up by Rio Grande, which they've made many of the games.

354
00:26:09,807 --> 00:26:10,610
Rym: We like yep.

355
00:26:11,011 --> 00:26:12,977
Scott: I think the designer is a man.

356
00:26:13,017 --> 00:26:15,887
Rym: well or Nella has he made anything else we've played.

357
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:16,930
Scott: That's a good question.

358
00:26:17,011 --> 00:26:18,929
Scott: Let me open that up here while you say something.

359
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:24,470
Rym: Well, you see most of the people who make the games we like are very German with very German sounding names.

360
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:27,580
Rym: I mean is yeah, yep, Iman.

361
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:31,776
Scott: well or Naya has made fantasy pub Hair my gore.

362
00:26:31,817 --> 00:26:33,244
Rym: has he made anything we care about?

363
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,767
Scott: ill Prince it I think I've heard of that one.

364
00:26:36,211 --> 00:26:38,421
Scott: But ultra mayor is by far his most popular game.

365
00:26:38,441 --> 00:26:46,390
Scott: just looking at the board game geek rankings Ultra mayor is number one seven four and his second most popular game ill Prince it is four twelve.

366
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:50,041
Scott: The next one is six seventy eight and the next one is twelve seventeen.

367
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:50,423
Scott: Yeah.

368
00:26:50,844 --> 00:26:52,690
Scott: Yeah, this is most popular game.

369
00:26:52,951 --> 00:26:59,750
Scott: He's no Knizia and it says here that it takes two to five players and the box says it lasts 60 minutes.

370
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:04,549
Scott: But I say if you playing with us and you don't suck it won't take nearly that long.

371
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:16,953
Rym: now this is one of those games and there seem to be a number of games like this that are out or have been out in many In the last five or six years where you'll have a lot of cards and while it's on a board and it acts like a Board game.

372
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:22,353
Rym: It's really more of a card game and furthermore the cards are Multipurpose.

373
00:27:22,613 --> 00:27:31,762
Rym: they'll have a whole bunch of different stuff on them and depending on when you use the card and how The different stuff matters at different times and does different things.

374
00:27:32,103 --> 00:27:35,594
Scott: Yeah, there's really two important things in this game and that is the cards.

375
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:41,799
Scott: it's a card drafting game kind of like ticket to ride with the card drafting and It's a trading game.

376
00:27:42,342 --> 00:27:50,693
Scott: and it's not a trading game like like settlers where you can trade and the option is there or like traders of Genoa where trading is there and you can Do it but you don't have to.

377
00:27:51,054 --> 00:27:56,070
Scott: it's a game where trading is sort of mandatory with a pretty clever system.

378
00:27:56,451 --> 00:28:00,924
Rym: Yeah, except that I'll note that in the game we played there was almost no trading.

379
00:28:01,065 --> 00:28:05,309
Rym: everyone would say, you know what fuck you I'm just not gonna trade because I know it's gonna screw you.

380
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:09,810
Scott: But at the same time I traded as often as I possibly could and I won.

381
00:28:10,392 --> 00:28:13,844
Rym: I came in a close second place only having traded once or twice ever.

382
00:28:14,065 --> 00:28:15,510
Scott: Yeah, so it's a tough call.

383
00:28:16,031 --> 00:28:17,375
Scott: I gotta make a disclaimer.

384
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:24,299
Scott: We only played this game once but it is a simple game and I do remember the play very well Yeah, and it was with all newbies.

385
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,909
Rym: We all learned how to play the game right.

386
00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:30,248
Scott: then Yeah, it was us two and two strangers at uber con some pretty cool strangers.

387
00:28:30,288 --> 00:28:35,066
Scott: I got to say Yeah, usually people at gaming conventions if they don't smell they're pretty cool and they didn't smell.

388
00:28:35,307 --> 00:28:36,210
Scott: What is a girl even?

389
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,014
Scott: Oh my god, huh?

390
00:28:37,517 --> 00:28:42,970
Rym: And they really like to play Puerto Rico Yeah, and the guy we were playing with, you know, he was real quiet at first.

391
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:47,270
Rym: But then when we started playing that guy had his shit together when it came to board gaming.

392
00:28:47,632 --> 00:28:48,957
Scott: Oh, he freaky he was smart.

393
00:28:49,037 --> 00:28:49,841
Scott: He knew what he was doing.

394
00:28:49,901 --> 00:28:55,081
Scott: Definitely a good old board gaming guy Yeah, and above average at least definitely outplayed.

395
00:28:55,142 --> 00:28:57,350
Scott: if I met that guy again, I'll play a game with him now.

396
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:03,801
Rym: one other disclaimer I have is that this is one of those games like goa that Reading the rules which aren't put together that well.

397
00:29:03,841 --> 00:29:15,829
Rym: in my opinion, especially in a loud room It's very difficult to learn how to play this game Without someone who has played this game before showing you because the game is so much simpler than it makes itself out to be.

398
00:29:16,366 --> 00:29:29,306
Scott: Yeah I think the real problem with this game goa and some others if they have cards that have a whole bunch of symbols on them and You kind of have to learn the symbols and what they mean when they're in different because you'll

399
00:29:29,527 --> 00:29:31,736
Rym: see you were gonna use a word Like symbology, I

400
00:29:32,178 --> 00:29:32,400
Scott: know.

401
00:29:32,842 --> 00:29:35,633
Scott: but yeah, you have to learn the symbology There we go.

402
00:29:35,854 --> 00:29:39,590
Scott: And there you'll see the same symbols in many different locations.

403
00:29:39,952 --> 00:29:42,430
Scott: So not only do you have to figure out the meanings of symbols?

404
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:47,630
Scott: But to figure out their meanings in different locations in different contexts and all sorts of things.

405
00:29:48,113 --> 00:29:57,330
Scott: So, you know unless someone explains it to you It's pretty hard to figure that out without stumbling through an entire game and then playing it correctly the second time through.

406
00:29:57,692 --> 00:30:03,064
Rym: there's also the issue that there are a lot of disparate game mechanics where Disparate.

407
00:30:03,246 --> 00:30:18,370
Rym: Yeah Yeah, if you do things in different parts of the game like different parts of your turn are like totally different games with Totally different mechanics that a lot of games are very unified where every part of your turn feels like part of this unified whole.

408
00:30:18,794 --> 00:30:20,290
Rym: But this game is a lot more disjoint.

409
00:30:20,591 --> 00:30:24,883
Rym: So you have to learn all of these very specific and very different things in order to play.

410
00:30:25,104 --> 00:30:27,190
Scott: Well, yeah now the bit.

411
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:41,250
Scott: I'm not gonna go into all the details But the basic mechanic of the game is you have cards in your hand and you have a card in front of you and the Card and for all cards are the same but on every card are two important plot spaces.

412
00:30:41,411 --> 00:30:45,290
Scott: There's a number at the top and there's a bunch of card symbols at the bottom.

413
00:30:45,692 --> 00:30:48,349
Scott: So let's say the card that's out in front of me right now.

414
00:30:48,731 --> 00:30:50,357
Scott: The number at the top is four.

415
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:53,410
Scott: that means I can have four cards in my hand.

416
00:30:54,012 --> 00:30:54,937
Scott: That's my hand limit.

417
00:30:55,339 --> 00:30:57,650
Scott: then at the bottom there are three card symbols.

418
00:30:58,112 --> 00:31:01,285
Scott: That means I have to play three cards this turn.

419
00:31:01,446 --> 00:31:05,170
Rym: now have to Must if you on your previous turn play a card.

420
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:08,881
Rym: This is the whole game that says on the next turn you have to play four cards.

421
00:31:09,402 --> 00:31:10,706
Rym: That's not an option.

422
00:31:11,047 --> 00:31:18,054
Rym: you must Must must must play exactly four cards no more No less.

423
00:31:18,436 --> 00:31:29,570
Rym: and if you have put yourself in a position where you cannot easily play four cards The game just basically takes out a dildo and rapes you with it until you are able to play four cards.

424
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:42,717
Scott: Yeah, if you can't if you don't have enough cards to play you can either trade other people in hopes of you know Trading a card for two cards or trading away victory points for some cards and victory points are money in this game Which is which I like that Mike.

425
00:31:42,737 --> 00:31:43,260
Rym: Yeah, you can.

426
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,890
Rym: you can trade victory points and money.

427
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,283
Rym: You can trade pretty much anything you've got.

428
00:31:46,444 --> 00:31:49,700
Scott: Yeah Also, you can always buy cards.

429
00:31:50,182 --> 00:31:52,250
Rym: the buying mechanic is very simple.

430
00:31:52,411 --> 00:32:02,370
Scott: It costs you a bunch of victory points to buy very few cards unless you've done something Clever to get cards from the cheap, but even then you're better off not buying cards.

431
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:12,359
Rym: Yeah, now it might think all right if the game has this trading mechanic But you're really trading with someone whose turn it is because the train is like a settlers You can only trade with the person whose turn it is.

432
00:32:12,821 --> 00:32:14,530
Rym: well generally always help them.

433
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:18,944
Rym: So why would you ever trade with anyone they add to make sure that trading will happen?

434
00:32:19,425 --> 00:32:28,230
Rym: a really cool incentive Where any time you trade with someone else when it's their turn that they don't get anything other than the trade.

435
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:33,249
Rym: But you get a little token and whoever has the most of these tokens gets a bunch of bonus points.

436
00:32:33,905 --> 00:32:44,190
Scott: Yeah So if you want if you pull off trades that help other players Maybe a little bit but also help you a little bit like you can make an even trade.

437
00:32:44,652 --> 00:32:49,214
Scott: And if it's not your turn you actually come out ahead because you get a prestige token You.

438
00:32:49,254 --> 00:32:53,839
Scott: just if you're way ahead in prestige tokens You don't want to trade because getting one more doesn't help you.

439
00:32:54,220 --> 00:33:00,290
Scott: and if you're not gonna get enough prestige tokens to score points Then you still don't want to trade because it's not unless you're ripping the other guy.

440
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:04,026
Rym: Yeah, so you might want to anyway because your turns coming and you might need cards.

441
00:33:04,206 --> 00:33:05,050
Scott: you might need cards.

442
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:10,220
Scott: But I'm saying is it if you're unless you're ripping a guy off Then you don't want to trade?

443
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,868
Scott: if the prestige token isn't gonna help you?

444
00:33:12,852 --> 00:33:18,610
Rym: I'd say an even trade can often be especially or don't forget King making always trade with someone who's losing.

445
00:33:18,751 --> 00:33:19,355
Rym: That's true.

446
00:33:19,395 --> 00:33:21,650
Scott: If you are the winner you do want to trade with the losers.

447
00:33:22,152 --> 00:33:25,043
Rym: Yeah, if you're in second place you trade with the third and fourth place people.

448
00:33:25,063 --> 00:33:25,585
Rym: That's right.

449
00:33:26,067 --> 00:33:32,190
Scott: Okay, so What happens is let's say I'm sitting here and I have a hand limit of four and I have to play three cards.

450
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:37,109
Scott: Well, I take three cards from my hand and I lay them out there in the order of my choosing.

451
00:33:37,289 --> 00:33:45,017
Scott: now I have to be smart about this because whichever card I put out last or on top is Going to be the card for next turn.

452
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:48,250
Scott: that determines my hand limit and how many cards I'm gonna play next turn.

453
00:33:48,832 --> 00:33:54,110
Scott: So if all the cards in my hand say next turn you will play one card.

454
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,135
Scott: Well, guess what next turn I'm gonna be playing one card.

455
00:33:56,276 --> 00:34:01,350
Rym: Yeah, basically you're all playing this solitaire solo not really interactive.

456
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:12,090
Rym: Well, basically solitaire drafting game with these goods cards But at the same time you're trading and interacting with all the other players in order to augment what you're doing on your own little board

457
00:34:12,572 --> 00:34:12,712
Scott: Yep,

458
00:34:13,114 --> 00:34:16,650
Rym: and pay attention what they're doing and trying to do anything you can to screw them up.

459
00:34:16,982 --> 00:34:19,257
Scott: Yeah Now the thing is the game.

460
00:34:19,277 --> 00:34:22,710
Scott: the scoring comes at two spots halfway through the game.

461
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:24,678
Scott: Well halfway through the deck of cards.

462
00:34:24,777 --> 00:34:28,333
Scott: There is a card that has a line on both sides that says alright This is halftime.

463
00:34:28,353 --> 00:34:29,056
Scott: We're gonna score.

464
00:34:29,538 --> 00:34:32,168
Scott: then you score again when the deck runs out and the game is over.

465
00:34:32,773 --> 00:34:35,870
Scott: So to score a lot of points you generally want to play more cards.

466
00:34:35,971 --> 00:34:42,664
Scott: But also if you play too many cards You'll have to buy more cards with your points that you just got and that's not so cool.

467
00:34:42,945 --> 00:34:54,310
Rym: Yeah, it even has Things in place for if you buy so much or you get screwed so much that you go into negative points Oh, yeah that you can just get totally ruined in this game.

468
00:34:54,552 --> 00:35:01,930
Scott: It's not easy to get totally ruined But if you suck you will be just destroyed and you won't be able to do anything.

469
00:35:02,151 --> 00:35:02,613
Rym: It's not.

470
00:35:02,653 --> 00:35:05,768
Rym: it's about 10,000 times easier than age of steam, so don't worry.

471
00:35:05,788 --> 00:35:08,309
Scott: Yeah It's not like age of steam where you'll get raped every turn.

472
00:35:08,951 --> 00:35:14,960
Scott: But if you make dumb moves like if you have a hand limit of one you have one card And then you play a card.

473
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,003
Scott: that means next turn you had to play five cards Which means you're gonna have to get four more cards.

474
00:35:19,224 --> 00:35:22,498
Scott: You're gonna get ruined Don't you got to not get in those situations.

475
00:35:22,739 --> 00:35:26,915
Rym: now the way scoring works is actually very simple And I think pretty elegant.

476
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:30,308
Rym: you'll have these goods and when you play the card say I play three in a row.

477
00:35:30,488 --> 00:35:40,337
Rym: you can play Whatever goods you want whatever order you want and there are different types of goods worth different amount of points depending on how many you have played Consecutively, so let's say I've played.

478
00:35:40,779 --> 00:35:42,927
Rym: I'm just gonna make stuff up because I don't remember the goods from the game.

479
00:35:42,967 --> 00:35:43,770
Scott: Ruby salt.

480
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,910
Rym: We all right God that's right.

481
00:35:46,212 --> 00:35:48,365
Rym: We were playing the game with these other people and we're used to.

482
00:35:48,406 --> 00:35:57,966
Rym: we've been playing you know Verator and motor and those kind of games which we bought in German Mm-hmm, so when I see rubies I say Rubine and when I see salt I say Saul's.

483
00:35:58,267 --> 00:35:59,290
Scott: that's what I say.

484
00:35:59,471 --> 00:36:04,530
Scott: It's only in a German board game context like if I go to the jewelry store, and there's a Ruby I say ooh a Ruby.

485
00:36:05,033 --> 00:36:07,408
Scott: I don't say ooh a Rubine even though I might for hilarity.

486
00:36:08,112 --> 00:36:12,978
Scott: But if I'm playing a German board game or any board game and I see a Ruby or assault It's Rubine and Saul's.

487
00:36:13,118 --> 00:36:16,454
Rym: the worst thing is we weren't even doing it to be funny It just came naturally.

488
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:19,466
Rym: and then the other people like what the fuck you talking about the Rubines.

489
00:36:19,707 --> 00:36:22,283
Rym: and we're like oh Oh, I'm like yeah the Rubines.

490
00:36:22,363 --> 00:36:23,390
Scott: What do you what you don't?

491
00:36:24,431 --> 00:36:32,638
Rym: Like it was obvious, but all right, let's say I got I played three Saul's and two Rubines Okay, and then five corn all right.

492
00:36:32,738 --> 00:36:34,062
Rym: now the the scoring works on.

493
00:36:34,182 --> 00:36:37,331
Rym: if you played one of something you get x points one point Pretty much.

494
00:36:37,351 --> 00:36:45,690
Rym: if you played two of something you get y points three of something and it the scale is different for every good And you have a piece of paper in front of you that shows you all of these things.

495
00:36:46,353 --> 00:36:50,230
Rym: You really want to try to optimize this by getting the optimal number.

496
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:53,640
Rym: I mean say Rubine maxes out at four cards.

497
00:36:53,661 --> 00:36:56,148
Rym: so playing four Rubines in a row gets you a bunch of points.

498
00:36:56,570 --> 00:37:02,635
Rym: if you Play eight in a row you get the same number of points because it's not per card that you get points It's per set of cards.

499
00:37:03,257 --> 00:37:09,215
Scott: Yeah, so if I play two Rubine one Rubine and then one wheat then one Rubine That's not so good.

500
00:37:09,235 --> 00:37:12,390
Rym: Yeah, but if you play two Rubines then one wheat you get a lot more points.

501
00:37:12,713 --> 00:37:14,770
Scott: Oh you get mad points for two Rubines.

502
00:37:14,891 --> 00:37:22,990
Rym: so that's another reason you want to trade is to try to get the Optimal sets and also to deny other people optimal sets in order to get the most points.

503
00:37:23,332 --> 00:37:29,637
Scott: Yeah, the other thing is like at most three Rubines And I'm not sure if it's three But like Ruby is a rare of course.

504
00:37:29,717 --> 00:37:32,226
Scott: so if you play three in a row you'll get maximum points.

505
00:37:32,327 --> 00:37:36,710
Scott: playing four in a row Or five in a row doesn't get you any more points than that you got the maximum already.

506
00:37:37,132 --> 00:37:38,658
Scott: So sometimes you want to break it up.

507
00:37:38,718 --> 00:37:46,270
Scott: if you have a whole bunch of something because you want to play like five in A row then something else then five in a row again because ten in a row is the same as five in a row.

508
00:37:46,832 --> 00:37:52,370
Rym: Now the only other mechanic is that the game comes with these really little nice cardboard paper ships.

509
00:37:53,272 --> 00:37:53,894
Scott: Oh the boats.

510
00:37:53,954 --> 00:37:54,456
Scott: Yeah, the boats.

511
00:37:54,656 --> 00:37:59,670
Scott: They're a lot like those boats from that Pirates of the Spanish Maine collectible boat game.

512
00:37:59,752 --> 00:38:00,165
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

513
00:38:00,691 --> 00:38:08,916
Rym: And the way these work is whatever card you put on top that determines which how many cards you have to play on the next round Will also have some sim.

514
00:38:09,117 --> 00:38:10,463
Rym: It'll also have a symbol on it.

515
00:38:10,784 --> 00:38:12,150
Scott: all the cards you play have symbols.

516
00:38:12,391 --> 00:38:15,268
Rym: Yeah, but it's another symbol that will say how far the ship moves.

517
00:38:15,389 --> 00:38:15,711
Scott: no It's.

518
00:38:15,852 --> 00:38:18,105
Scott: it's how many boat symbols on all the cards you play remember.

519
00:38:18,447 --> 00:38:18,970
Rym: Oh, yeah, whatever.

520
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:21,342
Scott: Yeah, when you play all the cards you play.

521
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:24,073
Scott: Let's say I play three cards on my turn There's four sim.

522
00:38:24,113 --> 00:38:27,522
Scott: There's four potential symbols on the side of any card.

523
00:38:27,822 --> 00:38:32,012
Scott: There's money pirate boat and Draw card.

524
00:38:32,053 --> 00:38:33,760
Rym: they might not all appear on a given card.

525
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,250
Rym: in fact most cards have very few if any yeah.

526
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:40,949
Scott: So then there's a little chart, so let's say I play one card, and it has a money symbol, and that's it.

527
00:38:41,312 --> 00:38:43,329
Scott: I get one money when I play that card.

528
00:38:43,791 --> 00:38:46,439
Scott: Let's say I play two cards, and they both have money symbols.

529
00:38:46,479 --> 00:38:50,530
Scott: well according to the chart two money symbols means I get three money.

530
00:38:50,632 --> 00:38:52,152
Scott: I'm just making it up You know.

531
00:38:52,232 --> 00:38:54,781
Scott: let's say I play three cards and all of them have a money symbol.

532
00:38:55,022 --> 00:38:59,722
Scott: according to the chart three money symbols means five money, it's the same as the other.

533
00:38:59,742 --> 00:39:03,015
Rym: scoring is just a chart of Increasing returns.

534
00:39:03,075 --> 00:39:05,346
Scott: yeah, so pirate is pretty bad.

535
00:39:05,587 --> 00:39:08,318
Scott: pirate means Let's say I play a card with a pirate symbol.

536
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:14,720
Scott: that means I draw a card from the deck And I put it in my pirate pile at the end of your game.

537
00:39:15,181 --> 00:39:18,954
Scott: the pirate pile is minus one point per card in the pirate Pile.

538
00:39:19,075 --> 00:39:26,385
Rym: you don't want pirate cards Yep But there are a whole bunch of ways around that because there's a mechanic where you can buy cards out of your pirate pile and all sorts of things.

539
00:39:26,426 --> 00:39:31,048
Scott: yes There's also a way we'll describe shortly in which you can avoid putting anything in your pirate pile.

540
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:39,460
Rym: now There's also a board and your ship sits on the board at a port and all the ports have little Symbols on little tokens to start and they have different symbols.

541
00:39:39,942 --> 00:39:41,770
Rym: the tokens all do different things.

542
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:54,209
Rym: So if you move your ship based on how many movement you were given by the cards you played Which like everything else you must use if you get to ship movement you must move to ship spaces no matter what.

543
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:55,154
Scott: yes Let me break it down.

544
00:39:55,174 --> 00:39:56,321
Scott: you play three cards.

545
00:39:56,522 --> 00:39:57,810
Scott: two of them have boat symbols.

546
00:39:57,951 --> 00:40:00,262
Scott: You have to move your boat three spaces.

547
00:40:00,343 --> 00:40:03,736
Scott: you move it three spaces And you end up on a spot on the board.

548
00:40:04,198 --> 00:40:06,164
Scott: the spot on the board has a little disc.

549
00:40:06,425 --> 00:40:11,287
Scott: you take that disc and you Put it in front of you, and if you have a disc in front of you already you that one's gone.

550
00:40:11,447 --> 00:40:17,221
Rym: now generally I mean, I'm not gonna go into all the discs It doesn't really matter But they'll be active as long as you sit in that port.

551
00:40:17,241 --> 00:40:22,530
Rym: so if you get to a port that has a nice one like one I really like is the anti pirate which protects you from pirates.

552
00:40:22,751 --> 00:40:25,822
Scott: Yep, it's great because you get that and you play all the pirate cards you want.

553
00:40:25,903 --> 00:40:32,530
Rym: if you keep playing cards that don't have ships You'll stay in that port every round, but you keep the anti pirates.

554
00:40:32,631 --> 00:40:34,321
Rym: You can play as many pirates as you want.

555
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:41,210
Rym: the girl in our game Did very well early on by finding a place that gave her money and just camping there dumping cards.

556
00:40:41,391 --> 00:40:47,075
Scott: Yep, but as soon as you play a card that has a boat symbol on it You're gonna have to move your boat And you're gonna have to lose.

557
00:40:47,095 --> 00:40:53,157
Scott: that ever token you have and if you don't land on a spot that has another token Then you're not gonna have a token.

558
00:40:53,177 --> 00:40:54,040
Scott: that gives you a boost.

559
00:40:54,181 --> 00:40:56,470
Scott: you pretty much want to keep a heart in their Harbor tokens.

560
00:40:56,852 --> 00:41:05,083
Scott: You're pretty much going to keep one of them in front of you the whole time And you also want to strategically Have the right one for the right situation because some of them really aren't that useful.

561
00:41:05,424 --> 00:41:13,387
Rym: so you've got this car drafting game You've got this trading game, and you've got this move around the board game all linked together into this game.

562
00:41:13,407 --> 00:41:14,009
Rym: There's a hole.

563
00:41:14,814 --> 00:41:14,935
Scott: It's.

564
00:41:15,117 --> 00:41:15,945
Scott: it's a whole lot of fun.

565
00:41:16,268 --> 00:41:16,871
Rym: Yeah It's.

566
00:41:17,634 --> 00:41:22,932
Rym: I really recommend if you want to play this game find someone who has played it before and ask them to teach you how To play.

567
00:41:23,193 --> 00:41:30,041
Rym: you'll learn so much easier than quicker than trying to actually read those Probably really poorly written instructions.

568
00:41:30,402 --> 00:41:35,809
Scott: Yeah, I tried to start reading the instructions And I was pretty confused and thank you to the guy who?

569
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:41,210
Scott: Saw us trying to learn the game and came over and just taught us randomly that guy's awesome.

570
00:41:41,411 --> 00:41:44,109
Rym: Yep, it looked like he really wanted to play too, but he had something else to do.

571
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:46,700
Scott: Yeah, it looked like he had to play in some other game.

572
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,467
Scott: I think for his company or something.

573
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:52,560
Scott: I think he was a Wheeler dealer game company guy.

574
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:57,702
Rym: yeah, and while the game's difficult to learn It's actually a much simpler game than the other game.

575
00:41:57,742 --> 00:42:01,176
Rym: We played at UberCon Mesopotamia Which had or the T&E card game.

576
00:42:01,336 --> 00:42:04,385
Rym: yeah, Mesopotamia had an infinite number of arbitrary rules.

577
00:42:04,486 --> 00:42:05,890
Rym: this game wasn't so arbitrary.

578
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,578
Scott: Yeah, this game once you figure.

579
00:42:07,638 --> 00:42:12,900
Scott: It's difficult to figure out, but once you've got it It's actually easy, and it's actually awesome.

580
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:23,343
Scott: and while it's got that mechanic Where if you don't know what you're doing you can still play, but you'll suck And then if you know what you're doing, you'll be awesome at it.

581
00:42:23,805 --> 00:42:32,368
Rym: Yeah, but even when you're sucking It's a game where you can still enjoy yourself Not like age of steam where the moment you lose it's done, and it's not even worth playing.

582
00:42:32,388 --> 00:42:42,670
Scott: yeah I think my moment of revelation was about halfway through the game because like the first half of the game I was just trying to play lots of cards, and you know I was working with the symbols on the side.

583
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:58,056
Scott: So I was trying to use the symbols to draw more cards and get more points directly But then at the halftime when I realized oh I play the resources in order I get a shit ton of points because at the halftime I broke away in a huge lead.

584
00:42:58,478 --> 00:43:00,685
Rym: probably my favorite thing about the game is just the trading.

585
00:43:00,725 --> 00:43:01,788
Rym: because it's so open-ended.

586
00:43:01,848 --> 00:43:04,680
Rym: I could trade Two of my cards for your card.

587
00:43:05,042 --> 00:43:06,850
Rym: I could give you my entire head.

588
00:43:07,412 --> 00:43:15,545
Rym: I could say I'll buy a card from you for four victory points meaning I'll give up four victory points and give you four victory points.

589
00:43:15,565 --> 00:43:23,670
Rym: you can trade anything You've got except for the tokens which are location dependent and the prestige tiles which can't be traded because that would be silly.

590
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:26,990
Scott: yeah But all you've got are cards and victory points.

591
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:33,550
Rym: Yes, are also money, but being able to trade cards and victory points is a very interesting mechanic.

592
00:43:34,012 --> 00:43:35,055
Scott: It is very interesting.

593
00:43:35,256 --> 00:43:38,186
Scott: for example Rym might have just played.

594
00:43:38,607 --> 00:43:39,009
Scott: I don't know.

595
00:43:39,772 --> 00:43:49,626
Scott: Three card symbols on his last turn therefore drawing a crap ton of cards But his new hand limit is only four and he's got a bunch of extra cards on my turn.

596
00:43:49,666 --> 00:43:56,064
Scott: I don't have enough cards and I need to play one more and it cost three to buy one from the day.

597
00:43:56,104 --> 00:43:57,650
Scott: cause three to buy one from the deck.

598
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:00,268
Rym: so Let's say I'll just sell my card to Scott for two.

599
00:44:00,409 --> 00:44:02,481
Scott: yeah But I think if you have too many cards in your hand.

600
00:44:02,501 --> 00:44:04,090
Scott: don't the extras go in the pirate pile?

601
00:44:04,613 --> 00:44:05,216
Rym: I don't remember.

602
00:44:05,237 --> 00:44:06,504
Scott: I think they do so.

603
00:44:06,947 --> 00:44:16,601
Scott: at this point I might be able to buy a card from Rym for less than it would cost to buy it from the deck and Rym also doesn't have to put a card in his pirate pile.

604
00:44:16,802 --> 00:44:18,709
Scott: so what you can work out cool stuff like that.

605
00:44:19,352 --> 00:44:20,878
Rym: The trading could be really interesting.

606
00:44:20,938 --> 00:44:31,427
Rym: of course it seems like it'll suffer from settlers syndrome Where if you're playing with all experienced players they'll tend to not trade much at all Because they don't want to help anyone out unless when they're king making.

607
00:44:31,447 --> 00:44:40,830
Scott: yeah People will only trade if they're smart when they're king making or when there's an obvious advantage And I think the introduction of the prestige tokens.

608
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:48,130
Scott: Actually, it makes a slight advantage for someone to trade an even trade because the settlers you would never make an even trade almost ever.

609
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:52,649
Scott: You know or you might you know do it arbitrarily because it's so even.

610
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:57,273
Rym: well I did something kind of asked near the end of the game or I was like you know what and I went to all the Other players.

611
00:44:57,314 --> 00:44:59,490
Rym: I was like I'll give you a victory point for nothing.

612
00:45:00,211 --> 00:45:02,801
Rym: I'll give you a victory point for nothing to to get some prestige tokens.

613
00:45:02,822 --> 00:45:04,810
Rym: that gave me a bunch more points than I gave up.

614
00:45:05,752 --> 00:45:11,119
Scott: Ah, I think the thing was is that when you did that eventually all the players are like all right I'll do it too.

615
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:11,808
Scott: I'll do it too.

616
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:17,428
Scott: And then everyone ends up giving every player three victory points on every turn, and then it gets silly.

617
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:21,424
Scott: yeah I mean yeah giving more than one puts you at a loss.

618
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:23,372
Rym: not really it depends It does.

619
00:45:23,513 --> 00:45:25,644
Scott: it does depend like if I was.

620
00:45:25,664 --> 00:45:33,210
Scott: you know for example If you were way ahead in the game and the amount of points you got from prestige tokens might put me ahead.

621
00:45:33,793 --> 00:45:36,028
Scott: You know would people trade me?

622
00:45:36,732 --> 00:45:41,273
Scott: You know would let me give them a victory point for nothing so I can get You.

623
00:45:41,353 --> 00:45:44,346
Rym: that's the reason the game falls victim to settler's center.

624
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:51,250
Rym: very easily Experienced players see right through that sort of crap and know exactly what you're trying to do when you trade with anyone.

625
00:45:51,792 --> 00:46:07,150
Rym: So among experienced players in a game like this typically any trade will only happen if Both people are desperate or the disparity between the two players point wise is so great that the player on Top is not worried about the player on the bottom.

626
00:46:07,351 --> 00:46:28,332
Scott: I could see in close games a symptom of pick the winner where You know the guy in first and the guy in second and if they're close enough that the prestige tokens will matter The two players who are losing and might not be able to win might choose for the second the second place player to win by making sure that they win on the prestige tokens if that makes The difference.

627
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:32,350
Rym: well if they wanted to do that remember they could just give all of their victory points to another person.

628
00:46:33,172 --> 00:46:33,876
Scott: Oh, that is true.

629
00:46:33,897 --> 00:46:35,970
Rym: You're so doesn't matter you're right great.

630
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:44,730
Rym: It's not really a problem because if you play with the kind of people who would do that just don't play board games with them Yeah, but it does leave open the possibility, which is a slight flaw.

631
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:47,621
Rym: Yeah But a lot of games have that even in Tigers and Euphrates.

632
00:46:47,983 --> 00:46:56,287
Rym: if you're losing you can just use your Disasters to screw people or just throw Conflicts out just to screw someone and let someone else win.

633
00:46:56,307 --> 00:47:05,019
Scott: that is true But it's not as openly blatant as giving someone all your victory points, and you know trading them cards Just to help them out perfectly.

634
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:06,426
Rym: Yeah in the end though.

635
00:47:06,446 --> 00:47:11,630
Rym: I think it's a game We'll probably buy because I'd like to play it again in the quietude of my own home.

636
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:14,139
Scott: Yeah, it was $40 at the convention.

637
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:15,445
Scott: I wasn't about to pay that much.

638
00:47:15,525 --> 00:47:16,830
Scott: I would pay 30 probably.

639
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:19,101
Rym: We'll probably buy it the next time we go to Rochester.

640
00:47:19,342 --> 00:47:25,270
Scott: Yeah, I think most of the reason I didn't want to shell out so much money is because it's primarily a card game.

641
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:29,870
Scott: You can play the game pretty much entirely with this deck of cards, and there's a big board.

642
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:34,390
Scott: That's all fancy with these fancy boats and a scoring track around the edge.

643
00:47:34,771 --> 00:47:35,774
Scott: That's barely.

644
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:38,022
Scott: that's like one fraction of the game.

645
00:47:38,323 --> 00:47:39,406
Scott: yet when you play the game.

646
00:47:39,447 --> 00:47:41,765
Scott: That's the big centerpiece It doesn't really make sense.

647
00:47:42,672 --> 00:47:46,410
Scott: It feels sort of like I'm getting ripped off buying this big fancy board that I barely use.

648
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:58,530
Rym: Yeah The game is definitely in some ways a throwback to the old high production value syndrome with games like end decker where they really Overproduce a game in order to charge a lot more money for it or to make the game really impressive looking.

649
00:47:58,751 --> 00:47:59,414
Scott: It's sort of like st.

650
00:47:59,475 --> 00:48:01,706
Scott: Petersburg, which is basically just a card game.

651
00:48:01,726 --> 00:48:07,030
Scott: yet They if you buy it nowadays you get a board and you get a few wooden pieces.

652
00:48:07,211 --> 00:48:09,223
Scott: That is pretty much just a map of.

653
00:48:09,324 --> 00:48:10,189
Scott: put the cards here.

654
00:48:10,932 --> 00:48:12,757
Scott: You know when you could just put the cards.

655
00:48:13,058 --> 00:48:17,050
Rym: arrange them on your own and Decker came with so many gratuitous pieces.

656
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:18,533
Scott: Yeah, the huts.

657
00:48:19,035 --> 00:48:21,462
Rym: Yeah, the huts were good event a lot simpler.

658
00:48:21,743 --> 00:48:22,505
Scott: I like the huts though.

659
00:48:22,565 --> 00:48:22,906
Scott: They're fun.

660
00:48:22,926 --> 00:48:24,914
Scott: Yeah, they're fun I'm not gonna argue.

661
00:48:24,934 --> 00:48:28,130
Scott: They're a good game mechanic, but they're fun, and I like they're an okay game mechanic.

662
00:48:28,431 --> 00:48:30,699
Rym: But we'll talk about end decker some other day.

663
00:48:30,799 --> 00:48:32,906
Scott: We will talk about the Hudson and deck or some other day.

664
