1
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,820
Rym: It's Wednesday, August 23rd, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,620
Rym: Let me bring you the second half of our coverage of Otakon 2006.

3
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,617
Rym: Let's do this.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,014
Rym: Well, because we couldn't fit it into one episode, as it would have been at least three hours, this is part two of our Otakon 2006 coverage.

5
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,579
Scott: Otakon episode numero dos.

6
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:31,828
Rym: Okay.

7
00:00:32,786 --> 00:00:32,808
Scott: D.

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,660
Rym: Now, one thing you might notice is that I now have my pop filter back since I made a new one.

9
00:00:38,081 --> 00:00:46,840
Rym: However, the first half of what you're about to hear was actually recorded contiguously with the previous episode on Otakon, when I didn't have a pop filter.

10
00:00:48,080 --> 00:01:03,880
Rym: After the showings, which you didn't do much to, we could talk quite a bit about the panels at Otakon, because Otakon, despite as large and awesome as it is, the panels are not any better or worse than any other anime con, and I'm really starting to get annoyed with the state of panels.

11
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:12,480
Scott: Yeah, if you want to hear, you know, what we think about panels, go listen to our anime next review, and that's a lot of what we gotta say.

12
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:18,680
Rym: Also- Or listen to the episode of GeekSpeak where we were on it, because we actually chided him for his panel.

13
00:01:18,882 --> 00:01:18,972
Scott: Yep.

14
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:27,940
Scott: And also, the latest episode of Fast Karate for the Gentlemen, they say a lot of the things about panels that I agree with.

15
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:36,858
Scott: They said a lot of things that I slightly disagree with a little bit, but when they started talking about professionalism and panels, I was like, "Yeah, you tell 'em,

16
00:01:36,878 --> 00:01:37,179
Scott: bitches!".

17
00:01:37,527 --> 00:01:37,940
Scott: That's right.

18
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:46,420
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I'm not sure how it would be done, though I think if I were in a position to make the decisions- Yeah, their idea for how to fix it was way out of control.

19
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,436
Scott: Yeah, my- They said that they should pre-screen all the panels, I'm like, "There's no way anyone could do

20
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:50,598
Scott: that.".

21
00:01:50,821 --> 00:01:55,860
Rym: Well, my idea is, 'cause I know anime next- well, not animazement, I always confuse the two when I talk about them.

22
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,175
Scott: Yep.

23
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:01,760
Rym: But they really kind of vetted me out before they agreed to give me a panel.

24
00:02:01,841 --> 00:02:02,646
Rym: They were like, "What do you do?

25
00:02:02,727 --> 00:02:03,754
Rym: What are your qualifications?

26
00:02:03,794 --> 00:02:04,036
Rym: Blah blah

27
00:02:04,056 --> 00:02:04,278
Rym: blah.".

28
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:04,650
Rym: Mhm.

29
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,900
Rym: And Otakon, I basically sent Lou my resume.

30
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:16,200
Rym: I was like, "Here's why I am an expert, and I want to do panels on blah and blah.

31
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:20,940
Rym: Here are the qualifications I have, here are recordings of panels I have done in the past.

32
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,152
Rym: Will you please give me a

33
00:02:22,193 --> 00:02:22,456
Rym: panel?".

34
00:02:22,785 --> 00:02:22,935
Rym: Mhm.

35
00:02:23,381 --> 00:02:28,611
Rym: And from what I can gather, most of the other panelists said, "I'm going to do a panel on blah!

36
00:02:28,812 --> 00:02:28,994
Rym: Oh my

37
00:02:29,014 --> 00:02:29,236
Rym: god!".

38
00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:30,238
Scott: Yeah.

39
00:02:31,222 --> 00:02:38,159
Rym: And I don't think there was a lot of really vetting out or checking on exactly what these panels are going to be.

40
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:52,458
Scott: See, here's the thing, is like, if you're gonna- there's three days to fill with panels in like four and sometimes five panel rooms, 'cause there was one room that was alternately like a panel room and a video room, they were switching it off.

41
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:52,770
Rym: Yep.

42
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:55,380
Scott: And that's a lot of panels.

43
00:02:56,002 --> 00:03:02,640
Scott: And if you were to screen for quality, you could not fill those rooms with quality panels the whole time.

44
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,539
Rym: Well, I know for a fact that there were several panels that were turned down.

45
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:07,495
Scott: That's good.

46
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,560
Rym: So there were- well, not turned down for quality, turned down for space.

47
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:10,963
Rym: Ah.

48
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,560
Rym: So there were more panels than there was panel time.

49
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,865
Scott: Okay, that's a good thing.

50
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:29,960
Scott: However, if you wanted just quality, if you set the bar at some line, I would say that 90% of the panels that, you know, even ones that didn't happen, would be gone and you wouldn't be able to fill the time.

51
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,960
Scott: Now the thing is, other cons- At least if you set the bar where I would set the bar.

52
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,206
Rym: Other cons have done this pretty well.

53
00:03:35,246 --> 00:03:45,680
Rym: I mean, I talk about an amazement a lot because it was a really good con, but they had somewhat fewer panels, but it seems like they really, really made sure that people running the panels knew what they were doing.

54
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:45,884
Rym: Mhm.

55
00:03:47,001 --> 00:03:54,320
Rym: And in general, honestly, me and Scott could do- we could fill all of the extra panel space if we wanted to.

56
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,140
Rym: We could do ten panels at a con and be fine.

57
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,120
Scott: Yeah, they could just head to the Rym and Scott room.

58
00:03:59,403 --> 00:03:59,598
Scott: Yeah.

59
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,919
Scott: We'd lose our voices, but we could do it.

60
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:09,320
Rym: I think we need to learn how to speak less boisterously and with less effort at conventions as opposed to when we do the show normally.

61
00:04:10,463 --> 00:04:10,503
Scott: No!

62
00:04:10,704 --> 00:04:18,199
Rym: That is beyond my- We could get throat mics or something.

63
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:19,269
Scott: That'd be awesome.

64
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:20,180
Scott: A lot for the ears.

65
00:04:20,601 --> 00:04:21,779
Rym: They're really expensive, though.

66
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,201
Scott: Yeah.

67
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:30,060
Rym: No, but, um- The base issue here, if you haven't gathered, is that- I hate to say this, but most of the people doing panels suck.

68
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,827
Rym: They do not know how to talk in front of people.

69
00:04:33,108 --> 00:04:36,620
Rym: They do not know how to put together a presentation of at least a high school level.

70
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,608
Scott: They don't do any preparation at all.

71
00:04:38,628 --> 00:04:41,240
Scott: They just, like, the guys, like, "I'm gonna do a panel on

72
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:41,300
Scott: X.".

73
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,419
Scott: They just walk in and just start talking about X.

74
00:04:43,902 --> 00:04:47,339
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I've been doing panels for, like, five years now.

75
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,000
Rym: And when I do a panel, either I do a panel on something I'm an expert on.

76
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,333
Rym: Like, I know my stuff.

77
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,060
Rym: I'm qualified.

78
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,540
Rym: And I always begin the panel by explaining my qualifications.

79
00:04:57,542 --> 00:04:59,199
Rym: And then I give the best advice I can.

80
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:09,580
Rym: Now, contrast that to, say, the Anime Club Summit at Anime Next, where it was just some staffer from the con who didn't really know a lot at all about the topic.

81
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:17,240
Rym: And while it's okay to not know about a topic, you can't speak authoritatively or seem to be authoritative when you're not.

82
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:24,920
Rym: Because there was a point at which she gave illegal advice, and if I hadn't been there to correct her, a lot of people might have done something that could have gotten them in trouble.

83
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:34,000
Scott: Yeah, and also, I mean, the problem is that if you're sitting up at the front of a panel, there's this assumption of everyone going to the panel that you're an expert on whatever the panel is.

84
00:05:34,221 --> 00:05:36,240
Scott: And that you know your shit and what you're saying is true.

85
00:05:36,642 --> 00:05:39,353
Scott: And if that's not the case, you gotta get your ass down from there.

86
00:05:39,414 --> 00:05:40,900
Scott: You shouldn't be allowed up there in the first place.

87
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:46,114
Rym: Or at least you have to say straight up, "I am not a member of whatever industry.

88
00:05:46,214 --> 00:05:47,699
Rym: I don't know anything about this at

89
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:48,160
Rym: all.".

90
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:49,372
Scott: "I'm just a doofus

91
00:05:49,412 --> 00:05:49,776
Scott: talking.".

92
00:05:50,342 --> 00:05:51,940
Rym: Yeah, but no one seems to do that.

93
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,260
Rym: Yeah.

94
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:58,760
Rym: Now at this point, I'd even be up for naming names as to exactly which panels really particularly were terrible.

95
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:02,119
Scott: Uh, was the old school one we went to?

96
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,720
Rym: Yeah, the old school anime panel was probably the perfect example of everything that is wrong with panels at conventions.

97
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,220
Scott: Science and anime, that was a pretty- we went to that, that was no good.

98
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,140
Rym: Yeah, I didn't actually go to that one, I knew better.

99
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,320
Scott: I walked into it, I saw it was bad, I walked out.

100
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,787
Rym: But old school anime, I mean, they did everything wrong.

101
00:06:19,868 --> 00:06:23,940
Rym: It had the typical- one of the panelists is someone shy who doesn't actually say anything.

102
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:24,344
Rym: Mhm.

103
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,740
Rym: It had everyone- the people up on stage were in costume from other unrelated events.

104
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:30,445
Rym: Mhm.

105
00:06:31,021 --> 00:06:36,440
Rym: They didn't really speak loudly or to the crowd, they made a lot of inside jokes to each other.

106
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:41,200
Rym: They just kind of talked, they didn't have any plan, they weren't authorities on anything.

107
00:06:41,741 --> 00:06:43,279
Rym: They just kind of rambled.

108
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,718
Scott: They basically just- it was like they just shouted out random anime and people went,

109
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:48,939
Scott: "Ooh!".

110
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:52,013
Rym: Yeah, they'd be like, "So, uh, Escaflowne!

111
00:06:52,174 --> 00:06:52,777
Rym: Woo!".

112
00:06:53,943 --> 00:06:55,071
Rym: "Uh, yeah, Sailor Moon!

113
00:06:55,775 --> 00:06:55,916
Rym: Ahh!".

114
00:06:56,641 --> 00:06:59,720
Scott: Yeah, it was just sort of random, there was no direction.

115
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:05,880
Scott: You know, if you have a panel, it either has to be entertaining or informative.

116
00:07:06,185 --> 00:07:06,735
Scott: One of the two.

117
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:12,380
Scott: So, unless you're really funny, then you can entertain a crowd for an hour.

118
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:22,740
Scott: Or, unless you have a lot of information and you can teach people, like a lecture at a college for an hour, or however long your panel is, don't do a panel.

119
00:07:23,061 --> 00:07:30,440
Scott: Just sitting up and, you know, talking to a room of geeks just randomly, like we do on this podcast, is not make for a good panel.

120
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,717
Rym: Not at all.

121
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,860
Scott: Hell, this podcast is better than 99% of panels out there.

122
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:41,520
Scott: I mean, we're actually talking about something, we're informing, we're discussing, you know, there's something to it.

123
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,079
Rym: Well, at the very least, people seem to like it.

124
00:07:43,366 --> 00:07:43,452
Rym: Yeah.

125
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,880
Rym: I mean, we got an email recently from a listener who said that they found our intelligence disconcerting.

126
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:48,940
Rym: Yeah.

127
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:51,240
Rym: I find getting emails like that disconcerting.

128
00:07:51,543 --> 00:07:53,020
Scott: Yeah, I agree.

129
00:07:55,081 --> 00:08:04,480
Rym: I mean, I guess if I were in a position to have a say in what gets a panel and what doesn't, I would run the panel selection process entirely differently.

130
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,520
Rym: And I would, one, solicit people I knew ran good panels.

131
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:20,640
Rym: And two, I would ask for full-on, like, mini resumes and, at least, even if I didn't actually read them, I would demand a layout of how long the panel was going to be, what it was going to entail, the talking points and everything.

132
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,860
Rym: Yeah, I mean- Because people who couldn't produce that don't deserve a panel.

133
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,955
Rym: Even if I don't read it, I wouldn't check it for content like, "Oh, I don't like that.

134
00:08:27,995 --> 00:08:28,718
Rym: they talk about this

135
00:08:28,798 --> 00:08:29,120
Rym: anime.".

136
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,320
Scott: Yeah, I want an outline of what your panel's going to be in a little more detail than a short paragraph.

137
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:34,472
Scott: Yep.

138
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:39,395
Scott: That way, maybe one panel, you know, I can tell, "Wow, this person really has their shit together.

139
00:08:39,414 --> 00:08:40,217
Scott: I'm going to give them two

140
00:08:40,258 --> 00:08:40,619
Scott: hours.".

141
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:43,304
Scott: You see some other panel and you say, "This panel sucks.

142
00:08:43,344 --> 00:08:43,825
Scott: It's not getting a

143
00:08:43,845 --> 00:08:44,005
Scott: panel.".

144
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,461
Scott: Exactly.

145
00:08:52,142 --> 00:08:52,643
Scott: Exactly.

146
00:08:53,504 --> 00:08:53,905
Scott: But yeah.

147
00:08:54,526 --> 00:09:04,560
Scott: Also, what I could do is, I don't- I think there's a lot of people out there who would do panels, and some of those people, a small percentage of them, can do good panels.

148
00:09:04,881 --> 00:09:06,748
Scott: And they simply don't know.

149
00:09:06,828 --> 00:09:08,494
Scott: the process for getting a panel is

150
00:09:08,655 --> 00:09:08,756
Scott: "ask.".

151
00:09:10,068 --> 00:09:10,300
Rym: Yep.

152
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:10,340
Rym: So,

153
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:17,048
Scott: what I would do is, on the con website, I would have a thing, like a panel submission form, where you would submit a

154
00:09:17,128 --> 00:09:18,450
Scott: thing, and then I

155
00:09:19,011 --> 00:09:25,579
Scott: would look through them every once in a while, and if one of them looked good, I would email them back and say, "Okay, send in all this stuff, and you can

156
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:25,779
Scott: have a

157
00:09:25,819 --> 00:09:26,099
Scott: panel.".

158
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,778
Scott: You know?

159
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,731
Scott: Sort of like, you know, because it's like inviting people.

160
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:32,818
Scott: "If you want to do a panel, come and get

161
00:09:32,878 --> 00:09:32,979
Scott: me.".

162
00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:45,000
Scott: Even though it'll create this huge quantity of panel submissions, and it'll take time to sort through them all, you're gonna find all the gems in that giant sea of panels, and you'll be able to pick them out.

163
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,699
Scott: And right now, it's just not easy to get, you know.

164
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:55,720
Rym: The other issue, even people who know what they're talking about, and can run a good panel, just aren't personable, or can't do public speaking.

165
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:03,020
Scott: I would talk to every person who's doing a panel for at least a minute on the phone or something, like to confirm and all that, and then I'd be able to tell if they're doofus.

166
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:25,480
Rym: The other thing, if there were enough staff, and I'm considering maybe doing this for an amazement, but there should be, or there could be, if they could pull it off, moderators available from the con who know what they're doing, who can moderate panels that might otherwise go off track and be stupid, or panels that could be good, they just need someone to keep them in line.

167
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,620
Scott: Yeah, well there are some panels that, like the OC Remix panel we went to is pretty good.

168
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,540
Rym: Well, they're experts, they know what they're talking about.

169
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,480
Scott: Yeah, the OC Remix people kept their shit in line, you know, because they know what they're doing.

170
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:40,378
Scott: And speaking of which, we met DJ Pretzel there finally, and he was like, "Oh, it's great that you use my music,

171
00:10:40,518 --> 00:10:40,780
Scott: awesome.".

172
00:10:41,181 --> 00:10:44,800
Rym: Yeah, we were worried because we emailed him several times asking for permission.

173
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,680
Scott: He apparently has an aggressive spam filter.

174
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,739
Rym: You know what, I'm fine with that, I very much use the broad brush spam filtering.

175
00:10:51,362 --> 00:10:56,360
Scott: But yeah, he was totally cool, which is great, and other than that, you know, they ran a good panel.

176
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:02,059
Scott: But some panels are a guy reading PowerPoint, which is like, "Oh my god, why would you want to go to

177
00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:02,260
Scott: that?".

178
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:11,320
Scott: You know, I would basically ban Power... I wouldn't ban the use of PowerPoint, the software, but I would ban PowerPoint panels, which is a guy sitting there reading slides.

179
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,462
Rym: God.

180
00:11:12,482 --> 00:11:15,113
Rym: I mean, didn't these people go to public schools?

181
00:11:15,154 --> 00:11:16,560
Rym: You have to do presentations there.

182
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:28,799
Scott: Yeah, and any panel that, you know, could benefit from some sort of moderation, like, because like, the Club Summit is the perfect example, because it's not really like a directed, you know, "We're gonna give you a lecture on how to run a good

183
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,100
Scott: club.".

184
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,433
Scott: It's more of a, "Ask questions about how to run an awesome club" type of thing.

185
00:11:33,673 --> 00:11:35,940
Scott: You know, you send a moderator to those kind of panels, you know?

186
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:39,731
Rym: Now, we used to go to the raves at Otakon every year.

187
00:11:39,812 --> 00:11:42,220
Rym: I mean, I was a big fan of dancing at conventions.

188
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:50,420
Rym: And the thing is, over the years, less and less anime or J-pop or Japanese techno has been played.

189
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,479
Rym: And more and more generic, boring, as god fucking damn it, techno.

190
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,630
Scott: Yeah, see, I'm a fan of, you know, trance electronic music.

191
00:12:02,592 --> 00:12:06,200
Scott: You know, I listen to Derek the Band at Sound Republic podcast, which is awesome.

192
00:12:06,621 --> 00:12:14,220
Scott: But, if I go to a dance party, you know, and it's at a club somewhere in the city, I expect some trance.

193
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,607
Scott: But I expect good trance.

194
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,297
Scott: You know, not generic, you know?

195
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:27,440
Rym: I mean, despite the fact that Otakon gets all these supposedly famous and amazing DJs, the dance has some of the most boring techno I've ever heard.

196
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:33,474
Scott: Yup, now, if I go to a dance at an anime convention, I expect anime music.

197
00:12:33,995 --> 00:12:36,200
Scott: Or video game music, something.

198
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,424
Rym: Now, KatsuKan has always done this very well.

199
00:12:39,705 --> 00:12:49,840
Rym: I remember one year, they played mostly just like Para Para Max stuff, and remixes of anime songs into techno beats, and Japanese just dance music.

200
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:54,180
Rym: And a lot of DDR music and stuff like that, and it was amazing.

201
00:12:55,901 --> 00:13:11,540
Rym: And the worst part about the Otakon dance is that not only do they not really play the anime music at all, and not only does there seem to be extreme resistance from within the Otakon staff for changing this in any way, because the fans of Otakon seem to be about 50/50.

202
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,565
Rym: But, there's always one or two DJs.

203
00:13:13,605 --> 00:13:18,898
Rym: It used to be DJ Miku, and it's other people who always say that they'll play anime music, but they're lying.

204
00:13:18,918 --> 00:13:19,760
Rym: They never do.

205
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:25,115
Rym: They'll play like one remix song, or one like, dance something.

206
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,840
Rym: And then the rest of it is just...

207
00:13:30,145 --> 00:13:30,479
Scott: Exactly.

208
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:34,206
Scott: I'm not putting down any of these DJs.

209
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:38,600
Scott: I'm pretty sure they're good DJs, but that's not what I want to hear.

210
00:13:38,941 --> 00:13:44,900
Scott: I'm sure if I went to the club out in the street where those DJs were, I might have a good time, and I might think it was pretty good.

211
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:54,920
Scott: But at Otakon, if I'm not hearing anime, even if it was some amazing techno, I wouldn't feel it the same way, because it's not what I want.

212
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:56,826
Rym: Well, it doesn't have to be anime.

213
00:13:56,866 --> 00:14:01,100
Rym: It just has to be something that the people who go to an anime con would enjoy.

214
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:09,680
Rym: I mean, PenguinCon actually did a good dance, because they played mostly weird freaking music and electronica, and then they played the time warp like four times.

215
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:18,200
Scott: But it's like, if you go to the store and you're looking for X, and someone at the store has a lot of really good Y, you're not going to be as impressed.

216
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,760
Scott: But if you're looking for Y, and someone gives you really good Y, then it's all good.

217
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:26,100
Rym: Like, if Otakon played OC Remix dance music, I'd be fine with that.

218
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,740
Scott: That'd be awesome.

219
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:40,299
Rym: Or even, KatsuCon two years ago, what they did is on Friday, the dance was 80s music, because many of the people who go to KatsuCon are my age, like our generation of anime fans, meaning children of the 80s.

220
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:48,300
Rym: So they played all 80s dance music, and I gotta say, that was probably the second best con dance I've ever been to.

221
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:48,920
Scott: Awesome.

222
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:52,920
Rym: The dance floor is absolutely packed with people actually dancing.

223
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,120
Scott: One good thing, though, about the Otakon dance this year, they banned glow sticks on strings.

224
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,020
Rym: Well, they said they banned glow sticks.

225
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,480
Scott: You saw glow sticks on strings there?

226
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,600
Rym: No, I didn't see, but I'll just play the following.

227
00:15:21,302 --> 00:15:25,080
Scott: But, okay, let's see, every hour and a half or so, they switch over.

228
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,859
Rym: I believe DJ Tetsuo is here?

229
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,074
Rym: Oh, yeah.

230
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:34,360
Scott: DJ Tetsuo, DJ Mecalicious, something of other.

231
00:15:35,222 --> 00:15:36,600
Scott: I don't know, it's really not that important.

232
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,860
Scott: All that matters is, it's amazing.

233
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,740
Rym: So I think you've been to Otacons before?

234
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:47,021
Rym: I've been to every one since they opened in, what, like 1995?

235
00:15:47,021 --> 00:15:49,200
Rym: Damn, you've been going around for a while.

236
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,973
Scott: So you say this is the best rave ever, why?

237
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:52,919
Rym: What's special about it?

238
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,700
Rym: I think it's just the outcome of all the people really getting into it.

239
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,500
Rym: I mean, I've never seen this place so packed in the entire Otakon history.

240
00:16:03,161 --> 00:16:06,535
Rym: And this year, I mean, the music is especially bumpin'.

241
00:16:06,696 --> 00:16:07,479
Rym: I mean, bumpin'.

242
00:16:08,403 --> 00:16:11,957
Rym: All right, so I see they banned supposedly glow sticks on strings.

243
00:16:11,997 --> 00:16:12,760
Rym: How do you feel about that?

244
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:16,959
Rym: They told me that, and I went in and I did it anyway, so come on.

245
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:17,999
Rym: No one stops you?

246
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:18,878
Rym: No one stops me.

247
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:19,522
Rym: Awesome.

248
00:16:19,582 --> 00:16:20,511
Rym: All right, here's a question.

249
00:16:20,531 --> 00:16:24,020
Rym: What do you think about circles, where a bunch of people circle around one or two people dancing?

250
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,266
Scott: I think it's a great idea.

251
00:16:25,306 --> 00:16:30,639
Scott: I think it's a way for everybody to show off their skills and just to get everything bumpin', you know?

252
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:34,438
Rym: All right, what kind of dance did you do with these raves, like poppin' log, breakdancin'?

253
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:34,860
Rym: What do you got?

254
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,166
Scott: I've seen a lot of breakdancing.

255
00:16:37,688 --> 00:16:40,879
Scott: Me personally, I love the glow sticks on strings and twirlin'.

256
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:47,700
Scott: I can do dual glow sticks on both hands, so I mean, I don't have a single problem with it.

257
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,937
Scott: But I can definitely get a good party goin', especially in the--.

258
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:56,220
Scott: If anyone's been here before, you know that there's one giant room, big glass windows.

259
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,960
Scott: Everybody can see what's goin' on, but they can't come in 'cause it's only the Otakon people.

260
00:17:00,245 --> 00:17:00,458
Rym: Yeah.

261
00:17:01,184 --> 00:17:01,960
Rym: You feel special.

262
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,192
Rym: All right, here's some kind of random questions.

263
00:17:04,212 --> 00:17:05,200
Rym: You're obviously an anime fan.

264
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,319
Rym: What was the first anime you ever saw that you knew was anime?

265
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:09,989
Rym: That I knew was anime.

266
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:10,915
Scott: Okay, let's think here.

267
00:17:10,935 --> 00:17:11,257
Scott: Oh, man.

268
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:20,520
Rym: I'd have to say it would have to be my favorite and also my first, and that would be the first episode of Evangelion.

269
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,979
Rym: Wow, that makes me feel real old.

270
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,364
Rym: Yeah.

271
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,085
Rym: All right, here's another.

272
00:17:25,366 --> 00:17:27,599
Rym: What was the first anime ever made?

273
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,009
Scott: Jeez.

274
00:17:29,861 --> 00:17:31,218
Rym: I'm seeing how many people actually know this.

275
00:17:32,002 --> 00:17:37,837
Scott: Well, I would think an actual anime, it'd have to be older than Astro Boy.

276
00:17:39,241 --> 00:17:40,798
Scott: Astro Boy's the oldest one that I know of.

277
00:17:41,705 --> 00:17:43,259
Scott: It is, in fact, Astro Boy, pretty much.

278
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,549
Scott: It's really awesome, yeah.

279
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:45,860
Scott: I would think it was Astro Boy.

280
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,304
Scott: You got it.

281
00:17:46,324 --> 00:17:47,419
Rym: All right, here's another weird one.

282
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,839
Rym: Can you name any directors of anime other than Miyazaki?

283
00:17:51,661 --> 00:18:01,020
Scott: Well, Miyazaki, the guy who did Ghost in the Shell, Kenjiro Yokoshima.

284
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,064
Rym: Yokoshima?

285
00:18:02,246 --> 00:18:03,417
Scott: Yeah, I think that's it.

286
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:08,780
Scott: Yeah, Kenjiro, because I used his name on an online play video game, right?

287
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,043
Rym: All right, so another one.

288
00:18:10,284 --> 00:18:11,249
Rym: What are you watching right now?

289
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:11,712
Rym: What's good?

290
00:18:11,752 --> 00:18:13,340
Rym: What's keeping your interest?

291
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:15,240
Rym: Okay, the ladies.

292
00:18:18,082 --> 00:18:19,165
Scott: Well, definitely the ladies.

293
00:18:19,205 --> 00:18:24,600
Scott: The ladies, I think, they turn out and they just party, like everybody else.

294
00:18:24,861 --> 00:18:26,219
Scott: They're not afraid to be partiers.

295
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,719
Scott: So are you single?

296
00:18:28,924 --> 00:18:29,779
Scott: Right now, yes, I am.

297
00:18:30,362 --> 00:18:31,479
Scott: Are you looking to hook up?

298
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:35,460
Scott: I don't know how for long because I just got a girl to sign the back of my badge with her phone number.

299
00:18:35,802 --> 00:18:37,118
Scott: Oh, that is beautiful.

300
00:18:38,663 --> 00:18:39,733
Scott: Can you think of anything better?

301
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:40,500
Scott: Come on, seriously.

302
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,799
Rym: That's what cons are all about.

303
00:18:43,144 --> 00:18:48,980
Rym: It's about meeting people you like and feeling at home with the people you know, even though you don't know their name.

304
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,000
Rym: So are you going to any other cons other than Otakon?

305
00:18:53,002 --> 00:18:55,636
Scott: I'll definitely be going to Takoshicon in Pittsburgh.

306
00:18:55,656 --> 00:18:56,240
Scott: That's where I live.

307
00:18:58,462 --> 00:19:02,240
Scott: They say in five years or so it's going to be as big as Otakon.

308
00:19:02,844 --> 00:19:03,099
Scott: Damn.

309
00:19:04,342 --> 00:19:06,310
Scott: Every year it grows and grows and grows.

310
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:14,020
Rym: Last year it was at the Monroeville Center, and then the year before that it was at a hotel and just like a small lobby and it just blew up.

311
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,817
Rym: Like, I mean, there was like I think 6,000 people there and it blew up.

312
00:19:18,937 --> 00:19:19,520
Rym: It was awesome.

313
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:20,241
Rym: Damn.

314
00:19:20,261 --> 00:19:20,565
Rym: All right.

315
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:21,679
Rym: Thank you very much.

316
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,419
Rym: Thank you, brother.

317
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,780
Rym: Now, see, this kid, I'm glad he was having a great time, but he illustrates the main gripes I have with the Otakon dances.

318
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:46,240
Rym: That one, I mean, aside from the music, which in my opinion just gotten worse and worse over the years, but the glow sticks are low and are fine, but the fact that people will take glow sticks, put them on strings, swing them around being a danger to themselves and everyone.

319
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:55,880
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I'm all good with the raver, you know, glow sticks on string thing, but in a crowded ass dance floor, that is not the time or the place.

320
00:19:56,441 --> 00:19:59,400
Rym: Two, he spoke about circles as though it was a good thing.

321
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,720
Rym: Now, circling is basically a thing that happens in a shitty dance.

322
00:20:04,302 --> 00:20:16,480
Rym: Whenever the dance music is so bad that no one can really dance to it or the crowd is just so non-pumped up, what happens is a lot of people will form a big circle where they kind of stand there kind of shuffling to the beat.

323
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,920
Scott: And there's a big empty space in the middle of them in the shape of a circle.

324
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:27,039
Rym: And then like the three people who at least think they know how to dance will be in the middle of this in and out dancing while the crowd kind of...

325
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:31,940
Scott: Yeah, like some guy who's a mediocre breakdancer will go into the middle of this circle and start breakdancing.

326
00:20:32,402 --> 00:20:35,700
Scott: Well, everyone else is sort of like this spectator in a crowd staring at them.

327
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,554
Rym: Now, you ever go to a real dance club where good music is playing and everyone's dancing?

328
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,080
Rym: That doesn't happen.

329
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:41,998
Scott: No, it doesn't.

330
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:49,380
Rym: And in fact, we have DJ friends and Tex was the one who was always so mad about this because he does lights and stuff for dance parties and clubs and everything.

331
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:53,100
Rym: And circles are the first sign that the DJ is sucking.

332
00:20:53,792 --> 00:20:53,899
Rym: Yup.

333
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,030
Rym: The moment circles form, you've got a problem.

334
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,080
Rym: That means that your dance is not going well.

335
00:20:58,561 --> 00:21:05,937
Rym: And I got to say that the dance at Otakon, I wandered around it while I was, after I interviewed this kid, maybe 15% of the people there were dancing.

336
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,560
Rym: Most of them were either making out in the corner or just standing there.

337
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,677
Scott: If you're making out, you have a hotel room.

338
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:13,100
Scott: Hello?

339
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,179
Rym: No, but they were just standing there.

340
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:23,560
Rym: And I don't know if it's the music or the fact that anime fans are shy or what, but it was really kind of mediocre and I really was not at all impressed.

341
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,460
Rym: At least the smell was not there this year.

342
00:21:25,961 --> 00:21:32,180
Scott: You know what I actually think they need at the Otakon rave and dance besides more anime style music?

343
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:41,540
Scott: If you've ever been to a wedding or a bar mitzvah and you order a DJ for a wedding or a bar mitzvah, you don't just get a DJ with a bunch of music.

344
00:21:41,941 --> 00:21:44,392
Scott: They give you dancers and an MC.

345
00:21:44,593 --> 00:21:46,080
Scott: You don't necessarily need the dancers.

346
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,620
Rym: Not many places get the dancers.

347
00:21:47,821 --> 00:21:54,240
Scott: Yeah, you don't really need the dancers at the anime convention because all they do is they do a dance and then everyone copies what they do.

348
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:59,120
Scott: And then occasionally they do cool dances because they are professional dancers and everyone goes ooh and aah.

349
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,426
Scott: You don't really need them.

350
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,539
Scott: You need to hire the MC.

351
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,640
Scott: The guy who, you know, because the DJ just sits there with headphones mixing the music.

352
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,058
Scott: The MC is like, "Alright everybody, let's get it up, yeah,

353
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:10,138
Scott: woo!".

354
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,680
Rym: See, I disagree because generally I find MCs to be just kind of forced and annoying.

355
00:22:16,141 --> 00:22:17,705
Scott: Some of them are forced and annoying.

356
00:22:17,745 --> 00:22:23,920
Scott: However, there are good MCs, professional ones, who can really, you know, they can get people excited.

357
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:32,020
Scott: It's sort of like they corral all those, you know, people just standing there and the people making out and, you know, the circles, you know.

358
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:39,460
Scott: And they corral the people and they kind of manage the crowd, you know, by talking and telling them what to do and massaging them.

359
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:46,060
Rym: Maybe the people who go to an anime con dance would probably resent that because ravers in general seem to really dislike the idea of an MC.

360
00:22:47,221 --> 00:22:47,883
Scott: That is true.

361
00:22:47,983 --> 00:22:54,700
Scott: However, if it was, you know, like a cool anime guy MC with the cool anime music, you know.

362
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:04,160
Scott: It'd be like, let's say you started playing like, I don't know, some theme from, you know, I don't know, World of Warcraft or something.

363
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,111
Scott: And then he started getting people with the Leroy Jenkinses, you know.

364
00:23:07,171 --> 00:23:09,419
Scott: It's like, it's got to be a nerdy cool guy.

365
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:17,540
Rym: Well, in the end, I guess what I would like to see happen is that Otakon always seems to say that the rave is what people want, so this is what we give them.

366
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:24,760
Rym: But many of the people I talk to want exactly what I want and a lot of them really wonder why that is not represented at all.

367
00:23:24,921 --> 00:23:26,860
Rym: I think what it is- Biggest anime con in the East.

368
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,340
Scott: I think what it is is they ask the people at the rave what they want and that's what they want.

369
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:36,740
Scott: I think if they switch to what we want, you would see just as many people at the rave, but you would see just a completely different set of people.

370
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:52,340
Rym: Well, what I'd like to see, because this would end the debate for once and for all, is if Otakon would allow two or three DJs who play nothing but like OC remixes and remix anime music and Para Para Max stuff and DDR music.

371
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:59,000
Rym: And advertise them as much as they advertise the rest of the DJs and see what happens on the dance floor.

372
00:23:59,708 --> 00:23:59,900
Rym: Yeah.

373
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,260
Rym: Because I gotta say, despite the fact that, I mean, RIT Anime Club is nowhere near the size of Otakon.

374
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:12,600
Rym: In fact, RIT, when we went there, was a little more than half the size of Otakon.

375
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:14,940
Rym: And it was a whole college.

376
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:25,739
Rym: But the anime dance parties we ran were early on very successful playing anime music because that's what people wanted to dance to, especially- Shy anime fans.

377
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,600
Scott: Yeah, I mean a lot of anime fans- Were going to be intimidated by the rave stuff, you know?

378
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:40,760
Rym: Yeah, there's a lot of somewhat nerdy, geeky anime fans who really just, if they're like MC Chris was up there or if there's some nerdy music, they'll get out there and flail around like a nerd.

379
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,101
Scott: Yeah, see?

380
00:24:41,121 --> 00:24:47,020
Scott: If you had MC Chris as the MC and not doing a concert, he could totally get the people into it no matter what the hell music it was, you know?

381
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,005
Scott: He could just do a concert.

382
00:24:48,126 --> 00:24:50,640
Rym: MC Chris got the Katsucon crowd riled up.

383
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,728
Scott: Yeah, you see?

384
00:24:51,768 --> 00:24:53,520
Scott: That's the kind of MC'ing I'm talking about.

385
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,627
Rym: Well, he didn't really MC.

386
00:24:54,688 --> 00:24:56,519
Rym: He just did a concert and then yelled a bunch.

387
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,160
Scott: Yeah, I mean, but that's what an MC is.

388
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,120
Rym: No, no, I mean he did a concert, yelled a bunch, and then he walked away.

389
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:03,236
Rym: Yeah.

390
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,366
Rym: He didn't keep talking.

391
00:25:04,648 --> 00:25:06,740
Rym: There was no MC during anything else.

392
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,779
Scott: The reason he's called MC Chris though, that concert was MC'ing in a way, you know?

393
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,200
Scott: Yeah, kinda.

394
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,150
Scott: That's what it's about, you know?

395
00:25:14,832 --> 00:25:16,880
Scott: MC just means you're a guy with a microphone.

396
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,600
Rym: Well, it means Master of Ceremonies.

397
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:24,640
Scott: Yes, and there's a ceremony and you master it and you get people excited in whatever way you can.

398
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:29,080
Scott: It doesn't necessarily mean, you know, the typical what the guy does at a bar mitzvah, you know?

399
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,390
Rym: Generally, the MC is there throughout the entire event.

400
00:25:31,511 --> 00:25:33,520
Rym: MC Chris got off the stage and never came back.

401
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,381
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

402
00:25:35,123 --> 00:25:46,920
Scott: But anyway, yeah, I think what Otakon should actually do is on Friday, full-on Crazy Rave, or no, or Friday, have all the anime OC Remix cool people, and on Saturday, keep their Crazy Rave.

403
00:25:47,121 --> 00:25:50,620
Rym: I say for now, just have one DJ who will do that and see if he's popular.

404
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,483
Scott: Yeah, that too.

405
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:58,320
Scott: But yeah, generally, I think in the long run, to appease both groups, if you have two dances, you do one one way and one the other way.

406
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:08,897
Rym: Otakon always, I mean, the staffers always say, and all the feedback I listen to, they always say that it's 50/50, yet if it's 50/50, how come the dance always waits 100% toward the ravers?

407
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,245
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

408
00:26:11,346 --> 00:26:14,240
Scott: If it's 50/50, then there's two dance rooms at Otakon.

409
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,660
Scott: Maybe you should make one room.

410
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,419
Rym: Yeah, currently, the way it works is one room is going boom, boom, boom, boom.

411
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,438
Scott: And the other room is going doom doom doom doom doom.

412
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,580
Rym: Yeah, the other room is like slightly faster, but it's really not any better.

413
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,979
Rym: And you usually can't even get in there.

414
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:33,380
Scott: Yeah, if they want, if it's 50/50, one room should be the music we want, and one room should be the ravers.

415
00:26:33,681 --> 00:26:37,200
Scott: Or, one night should be the music we want, and one night should be the ravers.

416
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:41,357
Scott: You have so much dance time, you know, you can do that.

417
00:26:41,618 --> 00:26:42,020
Scott: Why not?

418
00:26:43,163 --> 00:26:46,177
Scott: If it's a 50/50, why is 100% going to the ravers?

419
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:46,880
Scott: It's not right.

420
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:58,200
Rym: Now, because the concert was overlapping on Saturday with the club summit that we had to attend, since I was a panelist and we always make trouble there, we had to go to the concert on Friday evening instead.

421
00:26:59,061 --> 00:27:08,920
Scott: I kind of like that, though, because it used to be where the concert would just be at one set time, and, you know, if you had something else to do at that time... Oh, sorry, no concert.

422
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:09,392
Rym: Yep.

423
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:30,477
Scott: Having the same concert twice, once at night and once in the afternoon, meant, you know, some people could go at night, some people could go in the afternoon, especially since the venue was smaller, you know, so, where before the concert was in a crazy huge place, everyone could fit in at once, you know, everyone couldn't fit in at once at that place, so having it twice let more people go,

424
00:27:30,578 --> 00:27:31,080
Scott: which was cool.

425
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:41,080
Rym: Well, I thought it was great, except I saw in the forums and around the internet a lot of complaints about the fact that there were two concerts, mostly from people who really don't seem to understand what was going on.

426
00:27:41,221 --> 00:27:42,439
Scott: It was the same concert twice.

427
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:53,997
Rym: Yeah, and most of the people who were complaining said something to the effect of, "I wasn't able to go to both of them," or, "I don't have time to go to two," or, "It'll take up my whole con if I go to both

428
00:27:54,017 --> 00:27:54,440
Rym: concerts.".

429
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:59,760
Scott: Yeah, I do think that it, you know, it was pretty obvious to me that it was the same concert twice.

430
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,900
Rym: It was obvious to anyone with a brain that it was the same concert.

431
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:10,490
Scott: The thing is, is a lot of people didn't have brains, and it didn't actually say anywhere, "Both concerts are the same,".

432
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:18,260
Scott: and also, I don't, I wasn't quite sure if there were any measures in place to make sure people didn't go to both.

433
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,998
Rym: No, there really weren't at all.

434
00:28:20,681 --> 00:28:24,940
Scott: I think it would have been a little bit more fair if they made sure that, you know, you can't go to both.

435
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:33,820
Rym: I don't think many people actually tried to go to both, because the people who would want to go to the Saturday day one, who were in the cosplay or the masquerade, would have some trouble anyway.

436
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,239
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

437
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:41,240
Rym: Now, the nice thing is that the concert this year, A New Thing for Otakon, was in the power plant a few blocks away.

438
00:28:41,602 --> 00:28:42,769
Scott: I don't think it was in the power plant.

439
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:44,520
Scott: I think it was in the Rams Head next to the power.

440
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:47,960
Rym: It was in the power plant area next in the Rams Head.

441
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:54,940
Rym: Like, the power plant, there's this whole area with all these restaurants and bars, and there's this venue right there called the Rams Head.

442
00:28:56,041 --> 00:29:01,420
Rym: And I gotta say, at least it's my opinion, that that was a fantastic idea on Otakon's part.

443
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:09,051
Scott: Yeah, I never would have thought of that, but as soon as you told me, "Hey, let's have the concert in a concert place," and I'm like, "Oh my god!

444
00:29:09,312 --> 00:29:10,198
Scott: Captain Obvious to the

445
00:29:10,238 --> 00:29:10,500
Scott: rescue!".

446
00:29:10,721 --> 00:29:22,120
Rym: Now, again, I saw a number of complaints about this decision, but every single one of them was from a cosplayer who didn't want to walk there in their costume and didn't want to bother changing out of their costume for the concert.

447
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,100
Scott: Alright, uh, tough.

448
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:32,360
Rym: Well, I gotta say, even if it were connected to Otakon, you really can't go to a concert like that in a costume and expect the costume to survive.

449
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:38,740
Scott: Yeah, well, I think the thing is that in years past, the concerts at Otakon have been seated.

450
00:29:39,424 --> 00:29:42,360
Scott: So if you were in a cosplay, you would just go somewhere, sit down.

451
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:50,320
Rym: Well, in fact, remember when we went to the TMR concert and some whiny fangirls behind us got mad because we stood up and danced during the concert.

452
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,259
Scott: Yup, exactly.

453
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,680
Rym: And they couldn't see because they wanted to just sit there and be quiet and not move.

454
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,274
Scott: Yup, and then at the con feedback session, I said, "How come there were seats?

455
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,247
Scott: How come it wasn't general admission?

456
00:30:02,071 --> 00:30:03,398
Scott: There wasn't at least standing up

457
00:30:03,458 --> 00:30:03,699
Scott: front.".

458
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,099
Scott: And the guy was basically like, "Yeah, we couldn't do it for this reason and this

459
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:07,320
Scott: reason.".

460
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,019
Scott: And he had good reasons.

461
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,320
Scott: And, you know, there was like, they're not allowed to do that in the BCC and all sorts of stuff.

462
00:30:12,601 --> 00:30:14,860
Rym: And having it at this venue completely got rid of that.

463
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,409
Rym: Now, it was like a normal concert.

464
00:30:16,429 --> 00:30:18,160
Rym: It was like any concert I go see in Manhattan.

465
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,839
Scott: Yup, I think the thing is, is that really pushes out the, uh, you know, the nerdy types who, uh...

466
00:30:24,361 --> 00:30:34,259
Rym: Yeah, I noticed it seemed, 'cause I talked to a lot of people at the con who didn't go to the concert, and I found that one, it seems that most of the people who had complaints about the concert at all were the people who chose not to go.

467
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:34,804
Rym: Mmm.

468
00:30:35,522 --> 00:30:51,600
Rym: And two, the people who chose not to go, most of the reasons they gave were, I don't want to sound harsh, but, I mean, a lot of people had good reasons, you know, they were doing other things or whatever, but a lot of people, it just seemed like they were uncomfortable going to a real venue or venturing away from the convention center or anything like that.

469
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:56,960
Scott: Yeah, I'd really like to do a poll of, like, people who didn't go to the concert and what their reasons were.

470
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,280
Scott: I imagine a lot of people just didn't have interest in the musical groups.

471
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,486
Rym: Yeah, which is perfectly understandable.

472
00:31:01,506 --> 00:31:04,100
Rym: I mean, honestly, we'll talk about this in a bit.

473
00:31:04,722 --> 00:31:08,940
Rym: I was very pleasantly surprised with what kind of band Muck was, because I had no idea.

474
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:19,020
Scott: Yeah, well, I'm also, we'll talk about it in a minute, but, yeah, and I'm sure, you know, the other large group of people who didn't go to the concert were people who were intimidated by real concerts.

475
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:26,658
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I did see there were a lot of people who went to the concert, and they lined up like an hour before, even though everyone knew it was GA.

476
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,548
Rym: There's really no reason to line up.

477
00:31:28,629 --> 00:31:30,340
Rym: You can pretty much stand wherever you want to stand.

478
00:31:30,741 --> 00:31:35,640
Scott: Yeah, and it's like, as soon as you had the sticker or the ticket, you know, you were guaranteed to get in no matter what.

479
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,540
Scott: So we just kind of were eating dinner, people were going through the line.

480
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,240
Rym: We saw this huge line for the concert forum while we were eating dinner.

481
00:31:41,322 --> 00:31:41,878
Scott: No, it wasn't that huge.

482
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,014
Rym: It was huge compared to what it should have been.

483
00:31:44,094 --> 00:31:44,880
Rym: It should have been nonexistent.

484
00:31:45,302 --> 00:31:46,140
Scott: It should have been nonexistent.

485
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:57,400
Rym: And the best part was, all the somewhat nerdy people who decided to go, which won more power to them, I note that they could have just pushed their way up to the front like people in concerts do, but they all kind of stood in the back where they couldn't see.

486
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,400
Scott: Or they stood upstairs.

487
00:31:58,903 --> 00:32:01,420
Rym: Yeah, a lot of people went upstairs where you really couldn't see anything.

488
00:32:01,621 --> 00:32:03,159
Scott: Well, you can see upstairs just fine.

489
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:08,800
Rym: No, from what people said, you couldn't see anything upstairs, because all the rails were already filled with people standing right up against them.

490
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,840
Scott: Oh yeah, if you're standing on the rail, then you're good.

491
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,537
Scott: If you're standing behind someone who's...

492
00:32:12,901 --> 00:32:17,719
Rym: Scott, there wasn't so much space by the rails, and those filled up pretty much immediately from all those people who lined up.

493
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:18,163
Scott: Yep.

494
00:32:18,815 --> 00:32:18,897
Scott: Hey.

495
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:27,320
Scott: You know, basically upstairs is really supposed to be sort of a less densely populated area, you know, for people who need to take a break or that sort of thing.

496
00:32:27,481 --> 00:32:30,520
Rym: The funny part was, getting in, they split us off.

497
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,973
Rym: Well, basically there's a bar in there, and they ask, "Anyone who wants to drink, get in this

498
00:32:34,034 --> 00:32:34,317
Rym: line.".

499
00:32:34,883 --> 00:32:36,520
Rym: And we were like, "Whatever, I don't feel like drinking.

500
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,540
Rym: I've already been drinking for the past two days.

501
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,975
Rym: I'm not going to buy an expensive drink at a

502
00:32:40,015 --> 00:32:40,218
Rym: club.".

503
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:40,575
Scott: Yep.

504
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:47,801
Rym: Then we noticed that there was pretty much no line there, because not many of the people were over 21.

505
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:56,000
Rym: So we all walk over there, they check our IDs, we skip the entire line, and we're dumped out right in the concert instead of all the way around in the back.

506
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:56,402
Rym: Yep.

507
00:32:56,523 --> 00:33:01,780
Scott: Another good thing about that line was they gave you a wristband instead of drawing marker on your hand.

508
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:06,360
Scott: Which I approved of, because, hey, now I don't have to wash my hands to get this black mark off.

509
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,599
Scott: I can just rip this thing off my arm after the show.

510
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,241
Rym: Yep.

511
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:15,580
Rym: So we got right in, right before the concert started, and we also had a good dinner, and we didn't have to stand in any lines.

512
00:33:16,063 --> 00:33:16,300
Scott: Awesome.

513
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,620
Rym: Now, the concert itself consisted of two parts.

514
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:26,219
Rym: The first half was Nana Akitade, who was a Gothic Lolita idol singer, I guess would be the way I would describe her.

515
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,879
Scott: And I think that's the way she was described on the website.

516
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,100
Rym: Well, she did, what, the first closer to FMA.

517
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,359
Scott: Yep, that's what she did.

518
00:33:32,682 --> 00:33:34,040
Rym: And she did that song first.

519
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,720
Scott: And she did the opener to the new Powerpuff Girls Z show.

520
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:38,947
Rym: God, all right.

521
00:33:39,512 --> 00:33:40,400
Rym: The song is all right.

522
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:47,260
Rym: Typical cutesy, you know, la la la, I'ma say you, singing about cute things, but good God, is that show moe and scary.

523
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,297
Scott: Yeah, it is.

524
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:52,680
Scott: I think Nana Akitade in general is moe and kind of scary.

525
00:33:52,924 --> 00:33:53,839
Rym: Ah, she seemed kind of cool.

526
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,739
Rym: She was also, I'll admit, she was really cute.

527
00:33:57,625 --> 00:33:58,299
Scott: Eh, not so much.

528
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,599
Rym: What, what are you talking about?

529
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,087
Rym: Eh.

530
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:00,544
Rym: Eh?

531
00:34:00,962 --> 00:34:01,680
Scott: Not my style.

532
00:34:02,181 --> 00:34:03,440
Rym: I don't think your style is women.

533
00:34:04,326 --> 00:34:04,978
Scott: I think it is.

534
00:34:06,143 --> 00:34:08,340
Rym: I don't know how you can deny that Nana Akitade is cute.

535
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:13,478
Scott: She wasn't bad, she wasn't like ugly or nasty, but she wasn't like, oh wow, woo.

536
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:17,080
Rym: I can't imagine what kind of woman you would consider attractive.

537
00:34:18,282 --> 00:34:19,460
Scott: One that's not crazy.

538
00:34:19,621 --> 00:34:21,694
Rym: I don't think she's crazy at all.

539
00:34:21,714 --> 00:34:22,560
Rym: I don't know where you get that.

540
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,179
Scott: Yeah, I think she was a little crazy.

541
00:34:24,922 --> 00:34:30,120
Rym: You realize that most of the say you type stuff is just an act, because she's a musician and a professional.

542
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,958
Scott: Yeah, yeah, and I'm not a fan of that.

543
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,120
Rym: Okay, anyway, her concert was really good.

544
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:42,938
Rym: I mean, obviously, she didn't bring a band or anything, so she just sang over effectively the karaoke versions of her songs and mine playing a guitar.

545
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:43,225
Scott: Yep.

546
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,217
Rym: Which her hair then got tangled in.

547
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,456
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

548
00:34:47,184 --> 00:34:53,020
Rym: Which, at first, I thought, I wonder if that's staged, because I've seen a lot of say you staged stuff like that.

549
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,780
Rym: But I never got around to asking anyone in the second concert if the same thing happened.

550
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:04,099
Scott: Yeah, I was trying to tell if that was her real hair that got caught, or if she had like, you know... Yeah, that sort of thing.

551
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,360
Scott: But I couldn't tell, because I'm not an expert in that department.

552
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,359
Scott: And the hair was real long, and real crazy, so...

553
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,360
Rym: Yeah, but it looked kind of like real hair, but it was hard.

554
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,479
Rym: I mean, once again, I don't know either.

555
00:35:13,941 --> 00:35:16,180
Scott: Yeah, it definitely wasn't a natural color, that's for sure.

556
00:35:16,541 --> 00:35:22,914
Rym: For about the first two or three minutes, when she started playing the guitar, I thought, "Oh, cool, she's playing the

557
00:35:22,935 --> 00:35:23,239
Rym: guitar."

558
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:24,431
Rym: And then, "Wait a

559
00:35:24,512 --> 00:35:25,099
Rym: minute.".

560
00:35:26,021 --> 00:35:30,815
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, I was constantly looking, and I'm like, "Huh, hmm,

561
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:31,400
Scott: huh.".

562
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,940
Scott: I mean, I tried to look at the wire that she had plugged into the guitar.

563
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,638
Scott: I was trying to follow it to see if it went anywhere, you know?

564
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,139
Scott: And all kinds of stuff.

565
00:35:39,861 --> 00:35:41,859
Scott: And, you know, I was pretty much sure she wasn't.

566
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,079
Scott: And I was like, "There's still a slight chance she's playing

567
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:44,159
Scott: it.".

568
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:51,909
Scott: But then, like, I noticed once that, like, you know, in between songs, like, she touched the guitar, and it didn't make any noise, and I was like, "Ah!

569
00:35:52,311 --> 00:35:52,994
Rym: Uh-huh.

570
00:35:53,115 --> 00:35:53,417
Scott: Uh-huh.".

571
00:35:54,141 --> 00:35:58,180
Rym: Granted, there are many concerts where, between songs, they just cut off all those inputs.

572
00:35:58,562 --> 00:35:59,579
Scott: That could have been the case.

573
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:05,639
Rym: I think what would have told you a lot more was that her strumming was not in any way in line with what was going on.

574
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,764
Scott: It was a little bit.

575
00:36:06,824 --> 00:36:10,280
Scott: The thing is, I didn't really pay that much attention to the strumming.

576
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:16,680
Scott: Like, I looked at it, like, once, and it was just sort of like, you know, it wasn't a very complex part of the music, so it looked okay.

577
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:20,420
Scott: And, you know, I forget how to play the guitar since I haven't played since fifth grade.

578
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,500
Rym: But, I mean, her concert was good and expected of any kind of Otakon concert.

579
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,880
Scott: It reminded me a lot of the New York Tokyo Music Festival.

580
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:29,261
Rym: Yeah.

581
00:36:29,443 --> 00:36:30,819
Rym: I mean, she's a really good vocalist.

582
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:45,080
Rym: And she did surprise me in that many times bands like that or singers like that, when you actually hear them live, they often are somewhat a disappointment because their voices are typically so heavily overproduced in the CDs they release.

583
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:51,860
Rym: And while it sounded like there was definitely some vocal reinforcement going on, I think she's a really good vocalist.

584
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,119
Scott: Yeah, I think she definitely knew how to sing, that's for sure.

585
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,079
Scott: Yeah, and she pretty much-- She had to sing in skills.

586
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,820
Rym: And she riled up the crowd pretty much as much as I could have expected that crowd to be riled up.

587
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:00,902
Scott: Yeah.

588
00:37:01,323 --> 00:37:12,680
Scott: I think in order for that crowd to be riled up more, she would have had to, you know, either had a real band of some sort, you know, to pump up the volume and possibly more songs that the crowd recognized.

589
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:20,260
Rym: Well, the other thing is that it seems that Japanese musicians run into this a lot, that Japanese audiences are very different from American audiences.

590
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,200
Scott: Oh, super different.

591
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:26,708
Rym: I mean, unless-- I mean, there are some concerts where people yell and scream and dance and jump around, but a lot of concerts in the

592
00:37:26,808 --> 00:37:27,130
Rym: U.S.,

593
00:37:27,512 --> 00:37:32,479
Rym: everyone will just kind of stand there and listen, or maybe kind of dance a little bit, but they're not generally very loud.

594
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,160
Rym: And they don't react so much.

595
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:45,760
Rym: But, like, you see Japanese concerts where they do, like, one little look into one corner of the room, and that corner of the room explodes, and here she would do that, and that corner of the room wouldn't even notice.

596
00:37:47,383 --> 00:37:53,860
Rym: But, I mean, it was a good concert, and I think-- I'm pretty sure they briefed Japanese musicians as to how different American crowds are and what to expect.

597
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:54,441
Scott: Yeah.

598
00:37:54,985 --> 00:38:00,519
Scott: I'm also, you know, it's-- There's a thing where in real-- How would I say this?

599
00:38:00,921 --> 00:38:09,880
Scott: In American concerts that aren't full of socially not-perfect otaku, you know, the crowd is much different than at Otakon.

600
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,061
Scott: True.

601
00:38:10,081 --> 00:38:16,440
Rym: I definitely got the feeling that a lot of the people in the crowd had never actually been to a concert arena or a concert venue before.

602
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:21,360
Scott: Yeah, if it was definitely, like, a non-otaku crowd-- Granted, there were a lot of people who were.

603
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:29,080
Rym: I mean, when Pete and I were headbanging and thrashing and all of that, there were people around us doing the same, and there was a tiny mosh pit that formed in the front.

604
00:38:29,261 --> 00:38:29,481
Scott: Yeah.

605
00:38:29,903 --> 00:38:37,240
Scott: And as in any concert, even concerts, you know, with experienced concert-goers at them, it's very much a follower's game, you know?

606
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,380
Scott: Someone starts jumping up and down, then everyone's jumping up and down.

607
00:38:40,741 --> 00:38:43,740
Scott: A guy's one person swinging their fist, everyone's swinging their fist, you know?

608
00:38:43,861 --> 00:38:44,399
Rym: Yep, yep.

609
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,739
Scott: It's sort of like the wave at a baseball stadium.

610
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:53,040
Rym: Partly because a lot of people don't really know what they're doing, so if they see anyone else who looks at all confident, they'll just do whatever they're doing.

611
00:38:53,225 --> 00:38:53,397
Rym: Yep.

612
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,814
Rym: 'Cause they must know, "Look, he's throwing up the horns.

613
00:38:55,854 --> 00:38:56,418
Rym: I better throw up the

614
00:38:56,458 --> 00:38:56,599
Rym: horns.".

615
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,089
Rym: "Oh, he stopped throwing up the horns.

616
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:58,936
Rym: I better do something else

617
00:38:58,956 --> 00:38:59,097
Rym: now.".

618
00:38:59,946 --> 00:39:01,020
Scott: Yep, exactly.

619
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:06,299
Rym: Granted, I'll say right now, I wasn't thrashing or headbanging to Nana Kitani, even though I really liked her set.

620
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,181
Scott: Yeah.

621
00:39:08,124 --> 00:39:12,940
Scott: I generally didn't get super into it at all during the entire concert.

622
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,000
Rym: Well, you never really get into it at any concert.

623
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:15,742
Scott: Oh, I do.

624
00:39:15,803 --> 00:39:17,147
Scott: I get into it sometimes.

625
00:39:17,228 --> 00:39:17,870
Scott: It's just gotta be...

626
00:39:18,401 --> 00:39:20,018
Rym: When was the last concert you got into it?

627
00:39:21,263 --> 00:39:22,093
Scott: At Andrew W.K.

628
00:39:22,134 --> 00:39:22,620
Scott: I got into it.

629
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,594
Rym: Alright, that's the one concert I didn't go with you to.

630
00:39:25,882 --> 00:39:28,319
Scott: At Tool, I got into it in the beginning, early on.

631
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:29,639
Scott: And then I got tired.

632
00:39:32,087 --> 00:39:32,438
Scott: But, yeah.

633
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:33,862
Scott: I don't know.

634
00:39:33,882 --> 00:39:34,144
Scott: We'll see.

635
00:39:34,184 --> 00:39:36,180
Scott: Maybe we'll get into it again at the Camelot concert.

636
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:36,985
Rym: Well, I got into it.

637
00:39:37,025 --> 00:39:39,240
Rym: I really like... Well, then again, I really like that kind of music.

638
00:39:39,501 --> 00:39:39,673
Scott: Yeah.

639
00:39:40,441 --> 00:39:44,760
Rym: I really like just general female, clear, almost nasally kind of vocalists.

640
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,760
Rym: I mean, I like Ayumi Hamasaki a lot and all that.

641
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,774
Scott: Yeah, I like her too.

642
00:39:47,794 --> 00:39:48,159
Scott: She's cool.

643
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,700
Rym: Now, anyway, Muck was the band that came up after.

644
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,216
Rym: Now, originally, 'cause I didn't know anything about Muck.

645
00:39:54,236 --> 00:39:54,880
Scott: I never heard of them.

646
00:39:54,981 --> 00:39:56,067
Scott: I never heard of them either.

647
00:39:56,148 --> 00:39:58,220
Scott: So I went to the internet to listen to their music.

648
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,920
Scott: I think I went to their MySpace and listened to their music there.

649
00:40:01,381 --> 00:40:04,200
Scott: And I listened to like two or three tracks.

650
00:40:05,161 --> 00:40:11,115
Scott: And they weren't bad, but they weren't like... You know, none of the songs were like, "Aw, man, this is an awesome song.

651
00:40:11,136 --> 00:40:11,618
Scott: You gotta hear

652
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:11,860
Scott: this.".

653
00:40:11,981 --> 00:40:14,160
Scott: It was just sort of generic J-Rock.

654
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,872
Scott: And I'm like, "Oh, it's a J-Rock

655
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:16,215
Scott: song.".

656
00:40:16,961 --> 00:40:18,269
Rym: See, Scott didn't tell me any of this.

657
00:40:18,329 --> 00:40:21,750
Rym: When I asked him what the band was like, he said, "It's some stupid MySpace

658
00:40:21,791 --> 00:40:22,133
Rym: band.".

659
00:40:22,173 --> 00:40:23,119
Rym: And that's all he said to me.

660
00:40:23,382 --> 00:40:25,140
Scott: That's before I listened to the three tracks.

661
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:25,813
Scott: Yeah.

662
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:28,460
Scott: I listened to the three tracks like two days before Otakon.

663
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,632
Rym: Well, anyway, we're waiting.

664
00:40:30,652 --> 00:40:31,660
Rym: You know, Nanaki Tare came.

665
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:36,060
Rym: And my expectation was, "Alright, this 'MySpace band' is gonna come up.

666
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:39,258
Rym: I'll listen to a song, we'll cut out early, and we'll go do stuff in the

667
00:40:39,298 --> 00:40:39,439
Rym: room.".

668
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:44,580
Scott: Now, I was expecting to stay till the end, you know, just because it's a live rock band.

669
00:40:45,642 --> 00:40:49,100
Scott: And unless they're terrible, you know, it's worth it to stay just for fun.

670
00:40:49,643 --> 00:40:53,551
Rym: Now, they finally came out after hoisting up... Well, first, they hoist up this cymbal.

671
00:40:53,592 --> 00:40:54,679
Rym: It is the cymbal of the band.

672
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:59,040
Rym: Which led to many jokes from us as to what this cymbal stood for.

673
00:40:59,542 --> 00:40:59,996
Scott: I don't know.

674
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:01,503
Rym: We were just laughing.

675
00:41:01,523 --> 00:41:03,331
Rym: We were like, "It's a thing!

676
00:41:03,351 --> 00:41:03,411
Rym: Woo!

677
00:41:03,432 --> 00:41:04,315
Rym: Thing!".

678
00:41:05,542 --> 00:41:06,398
Scott: It's a pile of muck.

679
00:41:06,901 --> 00:41:08,840
Rym: A bunch of people made Prince jokes and all that.

680
00:41:09,204 --> 00:41:09,270
Rym: Woo!

681
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,199
Rym: And then the band finally comes out.

682
00:41:11,901 --> 00:41:17,520
Rym: And right before this, Pete was talking about, "You know, I would have been a lot happier with this concert if it was harder.

683
00:41:17,862 --> 00:41:20,037
Rym: I was hoping to rock out at least

684
00:41:20,399 --> 00:41:20,480
Rym: once.".

685
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:21,768
Rym: Mm-hmm.

686
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:28,080
Rym: And then this band starts playing, and they are approximately 400 times harder than I expected.

687
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:37,839
Scott: Yeah, I mean, they definitely, you know, compared to the recordings I heard on MySpace and other words on the internet, it was definitely way up the volume.

688
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,440
Scott: You know, maybe it's because I haven't been to a concert in a while.

689
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:45,780
Scott: Maybe it's because I had an expectation of one thing and I got another.

690
00:41:46,601 --> 00:41:51,959
Scott: But yeah, it was definitely, you know, just like every other rock concert you've ever been to.

691
00:41:52,781 --> 00:41:57,240
Rym: I was incredibly pleased with this band, and there was much headbanging and horns throwing.

692
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:58,720
Scott: Much indeed.

693
00:41:59,621 --> 00:42:04,300
Scott: I don't know if I'd listen to them or buy their CDs or anything.

694
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:04,761
Scott: I would.

695
00:42:04,982 --> 00:42:08,220
Rym: I've already started trying to get all their music because I really did like them a lot.

696
00:42:09,201 --> 00:42:13,300
Rym: I'd say about four of the songs at the concert I really, really liked.

697
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:16,140
Rym: And the rest were just, you know, typical, good, hard, rock-two songs.

698
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:19,978
Scott: There was only really one song that I was like, "Ooh, that's a pretty good

699
00:42:20,019 --> 00:42:20,260
Scott: song.".

700
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:24,660
Scott: It had all sorts of like this funky bass going on in the early parts that I thought was cool.

701
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,140
Scott: And then when he whipped out the harmonica, that was mad wicked.

702
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,800
Rym: Yeah, I wish he would have played-- I mean, I didn't know he could play the harmonica.

703
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:34,460
Rym: And he whips the harmonica out and he plays it for like a minute, and then he throws it away, but what he played was really good.

704
00:42:34,848 --> 00:42:34,977
Scott: Yeah.

705
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,099
Rym: Why couldn't he have done a song with the harmonica?

706
00:42:37,881 --> 00:42:39,126
Rym: It's like he just-- he was a teaser.

707
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:41,295
Rym: He was like, "Yeah, I can play the harmonica too.

708
00:42:41,315 --> 00:42:41,355
Rym: Ha

709
00:42:41,676 --> 00:42:41,757
Rym: ha!".

710
00:42:43,062 --> 00:42:56,630
Scott: I think the lesson to be learned, which is a lesson that I sort of already knew and just had reinforced, is that even if you don't like a band, you know, if it's a rock band especially, going to see them live-- going to see any rock band live.

711
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:59,480
Scott: that isn't ass is a fun good time.

712
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,640
Scott: And everyone sounds way good live.

713
00:43:02,341 --> 00:43:04,200
Rym: I would say, I mean, it was a fantastic concert.

714
00:43:04,601 --> 00:43:08,160
Rym: It was probably better than the average concert I've seen in my life.

715
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,158
Rym: And I've been to a lot of concerts.

716
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,400
Scott: Oh yeah, compared to the average concert, sure.

717
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,438
Scott: The average concert I've seen.

718
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,180
Scott: Yeah, it was definitely above average.

719
00:43:14,741 --> 00:43:17,378
Rym: I would probably put it in the top 15 of concerts I've ever been to.

720
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:17,970
Scott: Yeah.

721
00:43:18,441 --> 00:43:18,878
Rym: Hands down.

722
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,799
Scott: Well, I mean, how many concerts have you been to?

723
00:43:21,622 --> 00:43:23,155
Rym: Uh, 30 maybe?

724
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:24,497
Scott: Yeah, so?

725
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,120
Scott: Yeah.

726
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:25,779
Scott: That's pretty right.

727
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:30,760
Rym: I mean, it was really good, and I'd say it was the second best concert I've ever seen at an Otakon.

728
00:43:31,941 --> 00:43:36,940
Rym: Um... I mean, TMR was pretty good, but I enjoyed Muck a lot more than I enjoyed TMR.

729
00:43:37,422 --> 00:43:41,559
Rym: And Laraku was probably my favorite concert at any Otakon for obvious reasons.

730
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:42,178
Scott: Well, yeah.

731
00:43:42,621 --> 00:43:47,260
Scott: I mean, I think TMR, the thing was, is TMR the band and the songs.

732
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,480
Scott: I like TMR's songs.

733
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,640
Scott: Like, I have a lot of their MP3s, and I like, you know, to listen to them a lot.

734
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,619
Rym: See, actually, I don't like TMR that much.

735
00:43:54,902 --> 00:43:55,359
Scott: No, really?

736
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:58,260
Rym: Their music really, it reminds me of 2Mix in that.

737
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:03,118
Rym: Not that it's similar music, but that you hear a song and you immediately think, "That's a TMR

738
00:44:03,178 --> 00:44:03,479
Rym: song.".

739
00:44:03,844 --> 00:44:04,639
Scott: Yeah, yeah, you do.

740
00:44:05,623 --> 00:44:07,179
Scott: But I don't really have a problem with that.

741
00:44:07,681 --> 00:44:12,019
Rym: Yeah, well, their songs are kind of... It feels to me the way 2Mix feels to you.

742
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,036
Rym: That's the best way to put it.

743
00:44:13,806 --> 00:44:14,339
Scott: 2Mix is okay.

744
00:44:14,641 --> 00:44:16,639
Rym: You always complain about 2Mix when I listen to it.

745
00:44:17,261 --> 00:44:19,260
Scott: Because when you listen to it, you listen to it too much.

746
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,940
Rym: Yeah, but it's not like I listen to the same song in a row.

747
00:44:22,945 --> 00:44:23,438
Scott: Uh, okay.

748
00:44:24,241 --> 00:44:25,839
Scott: But anyway, I'm not going to get into that now.

749
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,879
Rym: I mean, if I listen to Summer Night and then Winter Night...

750
00:44:28,341 --> 00:44:37,100
Scott: I do agree, though, that at the Otakon TMR concert, we had slightly less excitement and fun than at the Muck concert.

751
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,079
Scott: Simply because, you know, if TMR was playing that little ram set, I think they would have been more fun.

752
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:44,600
Rym: Oh, they would have rocked the freaking house.

753
00:44:44,941 --> 00:44:46,140
Scott: Yeah, see, that's what I'm saying.

754
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:50,877
Scott: It's because we were standing in the way back of the main events of the BCC that the TMR wasn't the greatest.

755
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:54,300
Rym: Except the thing is, I think even in that situation, I think I would have enjoyed Muck more.

756
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,700
Rym: Because I really kind of like Muck's music.

757
00:44:56,781 --> 00:44:59,640
Rym: I mean, they're hard rock, but there was a hint of rockabilly.

758
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:02,379
Rym: There was a tiny hint of funk in some of their songs.

759
00:45:02,761 --> 00:45:05,680
Rym: There were definitely a lot of varied influences, and the music was good.

760
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,860
Scott: Yeah, it's definitely good music.

761
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:12,240
Scott: It's just not something that I would, you know, put five stars in iTunes.

762
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,240
Rym: You definitely met pretty much any band we ever talk about on this show.

763
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,460
Scott: I met pretty much anything that isn't stupid, wicked, awesome.

764
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:20,580
Rym: Yeah, you met everything.

765
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,000
Rym: And then you seem to find things that are really awesome that I think are kind of meh.

766
00:45:24,342 --> 00:45:25,354
Scott: Eh, well, you're meh.

767
00:45:25,395 --> 00:45:25,780
Scott: What do you want?

768
00:45:26,262 --> 00:45:33,030
Rym: But the concert was fantastic, and the sad thing is, a lot of people I talked to were like, "Ah, I didn't go to the concert, but that's alright.

769
00:45:33,091 --> 00:45:33,835
Rym: It probably would have

770
00:45:33,876 --> 00:45:34,157
Rym: sucked.".

771
00:45:34,881 --> 00:45:39,898
Scott: Of course, anyone who misses out on something always tries to... Well, it's not so much sour grapes.

772
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,820
Rym: Well, no, that's the definition of sour grapes.

773
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,120
Rym: The definition of sour grapes is, you did something.

774
00:45:45,561 --> 00:45:47,495
Rym: Eh, whatever you did probably wasn't worth doing anyway.

775
00:45:47,515 --> 00:45:48,240
Rym: It probably sucked.

776
00:45:48,823 --> 00:45:50,139
Rym: That's what sour grapes is.

777
00:45:51,161 --> 00:45:54,300
Rym: I don't know what you mean by it not being sour grapes.

778
00:45:54,522 --> 00:45:56,480
Rym: That is what the fable of sour grapes meant.

779
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,891
Scott: Yeah, I thought it was, like, slightly different.

780
00:45:59,012 --> 00:46:00,119
Scott: It's like when, uh...

781
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,010
Rym: Alright, someone has grapes.

782
00:46:02,393 --> 00:46:03,600
Rym: Someone else doesn't have grapes.

783
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:06,833
Rym: The guy who doesn't have grapes says, "Oh, those grapes are probably sour anyway.

784
00:46:06,874 --> 00:46:07,737
Rym: I didn't actually want

785
00:46:07,758 --> 00:46:07,878
Rym: 'em.".

786
00:46:08,423 --> 00:46:08,774
Scott: Uh-huh.

787
00:46:09,441 --> 00:46:10,900
Rym: What did you think sour grapes meant?

788
00:46:12,661 --> 00:46:18,220
Scott: Well, the difference that I figured is, you know, in sour grapes, it's two guys want grapes.

789
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:19,511
Scott: They both try to grab it.

790
00:46:19,612 --> 00:46:20,278
Scott: One guy wins.

791
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,680
Scott: Then the other guy says, "I didn't want it anyway," when he really did want it.

792
00:46:24,061 --> 00:46:29,620
Scott: This is more of a case of someone told themselves they didn't want it beforehand, so they didn't try to grab it.

793
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,064
Rym: That's the same thing.

794
00:46:30,084 --> 00:46:31,620
Rym: Lying to yourself is no different than lying to someone else.

795
00:46:32,265 --> 00:46:32,639
Scott: I guess.

796
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:43,520
Rym: Now, the other thing was, a lot of the people I talked to said something along the lines of, "Well, I don't like that Japanese music," or "I don't like j-rock," or "I don't like music that's live," or just stuff like that.

797
00:46:44,661 --> 00:46:48,120
Scott: Half of those are probably fanboys who didn't want to go to a real concert.

798
00:46:48,542 --> 00:46:55,960
Rym: Though I will say that actually Kate, Adam, and I left the concert a couple songs early, partly because I wanted to go to the room and take care of some things.

799
00:46:56,620 --> 00:47:01,240
Rym: And two, I didn't bring earplugs because I was stupid and my head was starting to hurt.

800
00:47:01,903 --> 00:47:01,944
Scott: Oh.

801
00:47:01,984 --> 00:47:02,760
Scott: See, you know, while--.

802
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,765
Rym: Well, the thing is, here's the thing.

803
00:47:04,006 --> 00:47:06,760
Rym: The concert was only listed to be like an hour long in the schedule.

804
00:47:07,922 --> 00:47:10,180
Scott: And instead-- I think it was two hours long in the schedule.

805
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:13,020
Rym: Well, instead, Muck played a full set in addition to Nanaki Today.

806
00:47:13,101 --> 00:47:15,160
Scott: I think they played every song that they have.

807
00:47:15,761 --> 00:47:17,940
Rym: I'm pretty sure they have a greater library than that.

808
00:47:18,383 --> 00:47:20,780
Scott: They played so many goddamn songs, holy crap.

809
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:25,140
Rym: They played a full set, and then they played a pretty big extended kind of encore thing.

810
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,320
Scott: They played like two CDs worth of music.

811
00:47:27,981 --> 00:47:31,439
Rym: It was definitely a lot of music, and the thing is-- It could've been like, it might've even been three albums.

812
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:36,160
Rym: I expected it to be a non-full set concert, so I didn't bother with the earplugs.

813
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:40,360
Rym: Thus, the concert went on too long and I couldn't take it anymore and I had to get out of there.

814
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:49,298
Scott: Yeah, see, I'm definitely, you know, earplugs at a concert are always good because then I save my hearing, and eventually, you know, when I leave the concert, there is a slight--

815
00:47:49,881 --> 00:47:54,620
Rym: Oh, good God, the moral here is when I came out of the concert, we couldn't talk to each other at all.

816
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:59,620
Scott: Oh, see, I could hear a little-- I can hear enough to talk to people, but I still-- my hearing's not perfect.

817
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:02,720
Rym: We couldn't talk to each other, especially since there was a loud crowd around us.

818
00:48:02,901 --> 00:48:03,920
Scott: Oh, a loud crowd will do it, yeah.

819
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:10,936
Rym: But then, walking back, we ran into this cool guy who was in the concert, and he comes up and he looks at me and he says, "Man, you were rocking

820
00:48:11,177 --> 00:48:11,278
Rym: out.".

821
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:12,342
Rym: And I was like,

822
00:48:12,924 --> 00:48:13,366
Rym: "Yeah!".

823
00:48:13,467 --> 00:48:22,037
Rym: And then we talked about the concert and he really, really, really liked it, even though he said something like, "Yeah, I didn't really like Japanese music, but someone convinced me to go to this concert and

824
00:48:22,117 --> 00:48:22,659
Rym: goddamn!".

825
00:48:23,563 --> 00:48:26,636
Rym: He didn't say "goddamn," but, you know, Snake's on a plane, I gotta say

826
00:48:26,657 --> 00:48:27,098
Rym: "goddamn.".

827
00:48:28,301 --> 00:48:34,079
Scott: But yeah, I mean, I can go without earplugs, without hurting myself, but of course I did lose some hearing as science.

828
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:35,663
Rym: Well, I can.

829
00:48:35,703 --> 00:48:40,240
Rym: The problem is, I've already been to more concerts without earplugs than I would have liked to have done.

830
00:48:40,571 --> 00:48:40,697
Rym: Yep.

831
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,580
Rym: Every time, it's because I forget and it's too late, and then I go to the concert anyway.

832
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:49,417
Scott: Remind me when we're done recording this, I'm gonna order the really good ones for 13 bucks.

833
00:48:51,043 --> 00:48:52,260
Rym: I might just go to that music store.

834
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:53,560
Scott: Oh, okay, then I won't-.

835
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,240
Rym: Well, if I go to Rochester this weekend, I'll just go to that music store.

836
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,519
Scott: Alright, you do that.

837
00:48:57,821 --> 00:48:59,439
Rym: I'll get my own, 'cause I'm gonna get some for Emily, too.

838
00:48:59,781 --> 00:49:01,239
Scott: Okay, get your own, I'll get my own.

839
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,809
Rym: Alright, now, in closing, the concert was fantastic.

840
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:07,940
Rym: I do hope that Otakon continues to use this venue in the future.

841
00:49:08,141 --> 00:49:11,719
Scott: Yeah, and I hope they get even more awesome bands to put into it.

842
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:16,640
Rym: Yeah, I mean, that is such a good idea to have a Friday and a Saturday concert there.

843
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:21,380
Rym: I can't stress how good of an idea that was and how well it worked.

844
00:49:21,902 --> 00:49:24,680
Scott: And I can only imagine how good it is for the bands, as well.

845
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:30,180
Scott: I mean, you gotta think about, you know, TMR, huge band, Larkinsiel, huge band.

846
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:36,280
Scott: They come over to America, to Baltimore, and they play one show, and then they go home.

847
00:49:36,762 --> 00:49:40,340
Scott: Playing two shows is like, it makes their trip so much more worth it, you know?

848
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,980
Rym: Granted, at least Lark had, you know, the arena.

849
00:49:43,421 --> 00:49:43,980
Scott: Yup, yup.

850
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:46,020
Rym: And they did a full concert.

851
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:47,119
Scott: Yeah, they did.

852
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:54,238
Rym: Plus, I loved seeing the interviews afterward, when they get back to Japan, and they're like, "Americans liked us, oh my god, oh my god, oh my

853
00:49:54,258 --> 00:49:54,419
Rym: god!"

854
00:49:54,581 --> 00:49:55,718
Rym: And they just really couldn't get over it.

855
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,378
Scott: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

856
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:05,800
Rym: But anyway, concert aside, the other side effect of having the concert there was that we went over to that area of Baltimore, which I'd never gone over to before.

857
00:50:06,562 --> 00:50:09,780
Rym: And we found this restaurant called the Mondo Bistro something.

858
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,160
Scott: We ate there, what, three times?

859
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:12,359
Rym: We ate there three times.

860
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:19,940
Rym: I mean, we ate there once, because we needed something to eat, and the Fuddruckers, that we have so many traditions about, was closed and out of business.

861
00:50:20,867 --> 00:50:23,319
Rym: Uh... So, we see this place, we eat, it's pretty good food.

862
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,659
Rym: The next day, for various reasons, we end up going there again.

863
00:50:27,501 --> 00:50:29,759
Rym: The next day, we need dinner.

864
00:50:30,461 --> 00:50:33,760
Rym: And we have like 20 people, maybe more than that, I forget how many people.

865
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,220
Rym: But we had the entire extended front row crew together.

866
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:37,399
Scott: Mm-hmm, and more.

867
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,060
Rym: Well, other than the people who weren't at Otakon, which there weren't many.

868
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,359
Scott: Yeah, we had a lot of people.

869
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:43,299
Rym: Yeah, a lot of people.

870
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:50,620
Rym: So, we're trying, like, I'm walking ahead when Scott's kinda right there with me, and we're trying to figure out how we're gonna deal with all these people.

871
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:53,060
Scott: And I thought we would just eat at, like, this Bongo place.

872
00:50:53,761 --> 00:50:54,460
Scott: What was it called?

873
00:50:54,982 --> 00:50:55,618
Rym: Oh, uh, Babalu.

874
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:59,276
Scott: Yeah, Babalu, but then I walked over and looked at the menu, and we're like, "Oh, wait,

875
00:50:59,337 --> 00:50:59,518
Scott: no.".

876
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:08,300
Rym: Plus, we needed a place that could accommodate that many people, because I didn't want to deal with coordinating, you know, who sits with who, because that's always just a stupid mess.

877
00:51:08,702 --> 00:51:09,460
Scott: It is quite stupid.

878
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:14,794
Rym: So, then I get the, we see the Mondo there, and I look at Scott, and I'm like, "Let's just eat at the Mondo, it was good

879
00:51:14,854 --> 00:51:15,077
Rym: food.".

880
00:51:15,521 --> 00:51:18,639
Scott: And I'm like, "No, I can't, it's eating at the same place three times in 40

881
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:18,720
Scott: days.".

882
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:21,740
Rym: But if you order three different things, because their menu was pretty varied and good.

883
00:51:21,821 --> 00:51:24,079
Scott: I did order three different things, I forget what they were.

884
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:39,831
Rym: So then, what I do is, everyone, you know, the whole group is still, like, kinda arguing, they're kinda ornery, because Scott and I haven't told them where we're gonna eat yet, they've been following us for a while, they're kinda, it looks like they're trying to stage a coup, like, "Ah, let's just go eat somewhere else,".

885
00:51:39,871 --> 00:51:40,636
Rym: or, "Eh, let's just do

886
00:51:40,656 --> 00:51:40,897
Rym: blah.".

887
00:51:41,561 --> 00:51:46,380
Rym: So I walk over to the Mondo, and I'm like, "Can your restaurant accommodate more than 20 people?

888
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:47,854
Rym: Could we just take this whole outside

889
00:51:47,935 --> 00:51:48,137
Rym: area?".

890
00:51:48,823 --> 00:51:49,407
Rym: And she was like,

891
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:50,736
Rym: "Alright.".

892
00:51:51,923 --> 00:51:54,800
Rym: And we took the entire restaurant, effectively.

893
00:51:55,101 --> 00:51:56,800
Scott: Oh, the entire outside seating area.

894
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,120
Scott: At least half of it, maybe.

895
00:51:58,361 --> 00:52:04,620
Rym: No, we took all of it except for there was one table with four people unaffiliated with us, and there was one table that had one empty seat.

896
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:17,860
Rym: We took the entire outside area, and it was great because we had separate checks for every table, yet we had the whole crew together who we could all talk to each other at the same time, and we drew a lot of stares from the people in the two adjoining restaurants.

897
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,020
Scott: And we got to see the people line up for the concert.

898
00:52:20,521 --> 00:52:21,098
Rym: Yep, which was hilarious.

899
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,059
Scott: 'Cause it was right there.

900
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:28,097
Rym: We also had, periodically, people we knew would walk by and go, "Hey, that's the front row

901
00:52:28,198 --> 00:52:28,480
Rym: crew!".

902
00:52:28,681 --> 00:52:31,279
Rym: And they took over that restaurant, and they'd come over and sit down with us.

903
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:31,545
Scott: Yep.

904
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:32,880
Scott: That happened, I think, twice.

905
00:52:33,281 --> 00:52:33,959
Rym: Yeah, that was great.

906
00:52:34,224 --> 00:52:34,393
Scott: Okay.

907
00:52:35,204 --> 00:52:35,378
Rym: Alright.

908
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,119
Rym: Now, the room.

909
00:52:37,869 --> 00:52:38,340
Rym: Oh, the room.

910
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:43,959
Rym: We pretty much talked about the con enough, other than closing ceremonies, final thoughts, bits about the food.

911
00:52:44,941 --> 00:52:47,300
Rym: And every year, we do something special in the rooms.

912
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:51,320
Rym: We get a number of adjoining rooms, and we keep the door open between them at all times.

913
00:52:52,023 --> 00:52:57,559
Scott: This year, we had two rooms with one king-sized bed, but that meant there was a lot of empty space, also, in the rooms.

914
00:52:58,049 --> 00:52:58,140
Rym: Yes.

915
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:05,200
Rym: Now, usually, we throw minor invite-only parties, or we generally hang out, a lot of us drink, and it's usually a really good time.

916
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:12,600
Rym: This year, we brought all of the podcasting equipment, and in addition to that, we did a couple of roundtables, and we recorded a bunch of stuff.

917
00:53:13,761 --> 00:53:17,080
Rym: Now, a number of hilarious things happened in the room.

918
00:53:17,464 --> 00:53:17,798
Scott: Oh, God.

919
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:19,160
Scott: Good God.

920
00:53:19,502 --> 00:53:22,878
Scott: First of all, there were about a hundred jokes about, "You know how I know you're

921
00:53:22,898 --> 00:53:23,140
Scott: gay?"

922
00:53:23,361 --> 00:53:26,360
Scott: as people were in bed and out of bed and sitting everywhere.

923
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,040
Rym: Yeah, which there are two origins to that.

924
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:37,640
Rym: One, we saw the movie, 40 Year Old Virgin, which has this long segment of two guys playing video games, some fighting game, and the whole time, there's going back and forth.

925
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:38,459
Rym: "You know how I know you're gay?

926
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:39,273
Rym: 'Cause of blah, blah,

927
00:53:39,293 --> 00:53:39,375
Rym: blah.".

928
00:53:39,701 --> 00:53:40,700
Rym: "Yeah, well, you know how you're gay?

929
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,289
Rym: 'Cause of blah, blah,

930
00:53:41,309 --> 00:53:41,533
Rym: blah.".

931
00:53:42,121 --> 00:53:45,140
Rym: And it was such a typical gamer thing, and it rubbed off on us immediately.

932
00:53:45,782 --> 00:53:52,440
Rym: Now, in addition to that, we got our first hate mail a while ago, and among other things, the guy accused Scott and I of being homosexual.

933
00:53:52,961 --> 00:53:53,378
Scott: We're not gay.

934
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:54,319
Rym: Well, we're not.

935
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,660
Scott: But you know how I know we are?

936
00:53:57,261 --> 00:54:06,240
Rym: So, you know, there's only two king-sized beds, and at one point, Scott and I are laying in this bed together, and Jess runs over and takes a picture of us.

937
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:07,918
Scott: Did you really?

938
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:08,619
Scott: I don't remember that.

939
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:10,319
Rym: So, of course, we pose.

940
00:54:11,307 --> 00:54:11,639
Scott: Oh, right.

941
00:54:11,902 --> 00:54:12,599
Rym: Yeah, that picture.

942
00:54:12,763 --> 00:54:13,318
Scott: I remember now.

943
00:54:13,622 --> 00:54:16,039
Rym: I'm surprised it hasn't been posted to the internets yet.

944
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:21,520
Scott: Gee, I wonder why people don't run home and plug their digital cameras into their computers and then upload things to Flickr.

945
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,900
Rym: See, James is good about that.

946
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:27,020
Rym: James uploads his pictures pretty much the moment he has an internet connection.

947
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,345
Scott: Yeah, I do the same thing.

948
00:54:28,386 --> 00:54:31,876
Scott: as soon as I get home, you know, so that's what everyone else has to do.

949
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:34,220
Scott: You know, if you have a digital camera, take pictures.

950
00:54:34,581 --> 00:54:36,280
Scott: As soon as you get back to your computer, Flickr.

951
00:54:36,622 --> 00:54:37,299
Scott: That's your job.

952
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:45,440
Rym: Now, also, when we first got the room, we were sitting in there, and we noticed out the window that there's this protest going on outside.

953
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:51,278
Rym: We have made it to the rooms, and there is a large, well, not a large, but a protest going on in the street outside.

954
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:53,840
Rym: We don't know what they're protesting, nor do we care.

955
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:55,160
Scott: But Scott has a picture.

956
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,939
Scott: And apparently no one else wants to say anything.

957
00:54:58,987 --> 00:54:59,240
Scott: Protest!

958
00:55:00,083 --> 00:55:00,209
Scott: Slayer!

959
00:55:02,906 --> 00:55:05,120
Scott: Oh, that was when he first got there on Thursday.

960
00:55:05,622 --> 00:55:06,237
Rym: Yes, it was.

961
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:13,359
Scott: I think they were protesting some construction company not giving fair wages and benefits to the employees or something.

962
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,299
Rym: Yeah, I couldn't really care too much.

963
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:17,220
Scott: It was some union crap, I don't care.

964
00:55:18,208 --> 00:55:18,859
Rym: I found it funny.

965
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:26,396
Scott: Especially since, you know, you couldn't read their signs or anything, because they were hard to read from far away, and yeah.

966
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:31,940
Rym: Now, of course, the room served multiple purposes aside from sleeping and hanging out and recording roundtables.

967
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,780
Scott: I mean- Storage of physical belongings.

968
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:34,211
Rym: Yeah.

969
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:43,240
Rym: Generally, at any given point in the day, a couple people would wander back to the room, often with people in tow who may not have been directly members of the front row crew.

970
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:47,699
Rym: So a lot of funny, interesting people ended up in our room hanging out off and on.

971
00:55:48,461 --> 00:55:49,500
Scott: Which is always exciting.

972
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:49,932
Scott: Yes.

973
00:55:50,300 --> 00:56:07,341
Scott: Because, you know, it's like, we'll be sitting in the room, so we'll call up some people, they'll show up at the door, and there's this crew of, you know, they expect just us, but there's like, I don't know, sixteen people hanging out in this place that they never met in their lives, you know, and they're here to just talk to us, and they're like, "Uh...".

974
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:16,176
Rym: Yep, like, we kept- and Anime World Order, I don't know, I think if they were busy or they were doing stuff at the con, but most of the time, we'd tell them like, "Hey, we're doing something awesome, come and join

975
00:56:16,237 --> 00:56:16,278
Rym: us.".

976
00:56:16,542 --> 00:56:17,279
Rym: And they were always busy.

977
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:26,720
Rym: But eventually, a couple times, they came to the room, and one time, when we actually recorded our roundtable, they brought in tow the ninja consultants and Fast Karate for the gentlemen.

978
00:56:26,921 --> 00:56:27,579
Scott: Yeah, Fast Karate.

979
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:33,275
Rym: And the Fast Karate guys didn't say a lot, and I didn't know, you know, like, "Alright, they seem cool, but they're kind of

980
00:56:33,316 --> 00:56:33,619
Rym: quiet.".

981
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:37,120
Scott: Yeah, I was like, "Hey, they brought these guys, but these guys aren't talking.

982
00:56:37,201 --> 00:56:37,809
Scott: What's their

983
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:38,093
Scott: deal?".

984
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,540
Rym: Yeah, then we find out after the fact that they're really cool and really funny.

985
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:43,260
Scott: Yeah, I don't know why they didn't open their mouths.

986
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:47,300
Rym: Yeah, I mean, the front row crew, if it respects anything, it respects funny people.

987
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:48,027
Rym: Mm-hmm.

988
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:52,475
Rym: I mean, we respect funniness- I mean, if Hitler told a good joke, we'd be kind of okay with Hitler.

989
00:56:52,921 --> 00:56:53,219
Scott: Maybe.

990
00:56:53,762 --> 00:56:54,193
Rym: I said kinda.

991
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:54,845
Scott: Yeah.

992
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,736
Rym: I mean, if he got up there, he was like, "That joke from Monty Python that kills

993
00:56:58,756 --> 00:56:59,018
Rym: people.".

994
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:01,720
Rym: I was gonna say it, but I didn't remember it in German.

995
00:57:02,864 --> 00:57:03,118
Rym: "Bägendag.".

996
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:04,299
Scott: "Bägendag.".

997
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:06,780
Rym: "Bägendag."

998
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:13,776
Rym: We're also like people who use hyperbole, or people who have cajones, but we'll get to that.

999
00:57:15,103 --> 00:57:16,460
Rym: So, yeah, they brought extra people.

1000
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:19,560
Rym: At one point, I was hanging- now, here's the other use of the rule.

1001
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:20,440
Scott: Oh, we had the pool party.

1002
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:24,760
Rym: Yes, Thursday, we had the pool party, which- now, we said we took over that restaurant.

1003
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:28,080
Rym: We took over pretty much the entire pool at the Renaissance Hotel.

1004
00:57:28,731 --> 00:57:28,959
Scott: Oh, yeah.

1005
00:57:29,461 --> 00:57:30,640
Rym: That was fantastic.

1006
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,299
Scott: And we couldn't take over the hot tub, though, because we overflowed it.

1007
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:45,320
Rym: Yeah, now, not only did we take it over with people staying with us, but we took it over with people we knew who were staying with us in other rooms in the hotel, and people we kinda knew, and people we knew who weren't even staying at any hotel.

1008
00:57:46,123 --> 00:57:47,320
Scott: Take that, Renaissance Hotel.

1009
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:49,880
Rym: Yes, we brought so many people in, oh my god.

1010
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:54,020
Rym: Of course, that meant I had to keep my cell phone with me in there, but it was fun.

1011
00:57:54,900 --> 00:58:07,760
Rym: Now, the other use of the rule was that, periodically, I would wander back to the room, sometimes with Scott Johnson or someone, and maybe one or two of us would hang out and have a bunch of drinks, and, you know, have the typical, "Yeah, let's talk about stuff when no one's around.

1012
00:58:07,941 --> 00:58:08,596
Rym: Ha ha

1013
00:58:08,616 --> 00:58:08,657
Rym: ha.".

1014
00:58:08,821 --> 00:58:09,554
Scott: Ha ha ha.

1015
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:12,620
Scott: Yeah, I really- I don't really get in on that.

1016
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:19,718
Scott: I don't really only go back to the room if I've got something to do there, like drop off stuff, pick up stuff, go to bed, wake up.

1017
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:32,060
Rym: Yeah, like Friday night, while you guys were wandering around doing stuff, and Saturday night while you guys were wandering around doing the movies, I would go back to the room, gather people, hang out, have some drinks, and then wander back to the con and make all sorts of mischief.

1018
00:58:32,483 --> 00:58:35,260
Scott: Yeah, I really- I try to stay at the con as long as possible.

1019
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:38,420
Scott: I'm paying for the con, I'm gonna be at that con as much as I can.

1020
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:49,153
Scott: As long as there's something there, I'm gonna do it, and I'm gonna go back to the room at the last minute, 'cause if I want to spend my time in a hotel room, even though there's plenty of awesome people there, you know, I can spend my time in a hotel room down the street.

1021
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:53,137
Rym: Yep, the hotel room I basically use to hang out with people I can't normally hang out with.

1022
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:56,760
Rym: Like, there was one point, and this started something that ended up being really cool.

1023
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,360
Rym: Conrad is a good friend of ours.

1024
00:58:58,520 --> 00:58:58,774
Scott: Combad!

1025
00:58:59,280 --> 00:58:59,449
Rym: Combad!

1026
00:59:00,561 --> 00:59:04,020
Rym: We don't see him so often, because he lives far away, and now he lives further away.

1027
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:13,196
Rym: But he came to the room, and we hung out and drunk and told our deepest, darkest, innermost secrets about love and life and money and politics, and you know, we were getting quite drunk.

1028
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:20,739
Rym: And then, we call up Yuko and all them, and all the webcomic artists are hanging out, and they decide that they want to come hang out in our room.

1029
00:59:21,481 --> 00:59:24,920
Rym: So I set up all the recording equipment, and god, I barely remember who was there.

1030
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:34,840
Rym: I know Mookie, who does Dominic Deegan, was there, and Brian Carroll of Instant Classic was there, and of course, Ido of Fallen was there, and C Squared was there.

1031
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:38,880
Rym: I don't think I need to explain what C Squared is.

1032
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:40,900
Rym: If you don't know what it is, you probably never will.

1033
00:59:41,785 --> 00:59:42,860
Scott: I think that's about safe.

1034
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:47,054
Rym: The thing is, I am probably a bigger fan of C Squared than I am of just about anything now.

1035
00:59:47,402 --> 00:59:47,634
Scott: Uh oh.

1036
00:59:48,082 --> 00:59:48,320
Rym: Uh oh.

1037
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:49,619
Rym: C Squared was double trouble.

1038
00:59:49,924 --> 00:59:50,178
Scott: Uh oh.

1039
00:59:51,265 --> 00:59:51,699
Scott: Uh oh.

1040
00:59:52,621 --> 01:00:09,140
Rym: Yeah, but they all came into the room, and we hung out for a bit, and then we ended up setting up all the equipment and recording a fairly long and I think really, really good just kind of roundtable about conventions from the perspective of webcomic artists and webcomics and webcomic panels and all those sorts of things.

1041
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,620
Rym: I haven't finished putting it together yet.

1042
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:25,000
Rym: I haven't even really listened to it fully, and we haven't had time yet, but sometime in the coming weeks, I'm going to play as an episode that entire roundtable, which was very fascinating to listen to, and I think we got a lot of interesting answers from a lot of webcomic artists.

1043
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:32,160
Scott: It definitely seemed a lot better than, you know, the average webcomic panel at a convention that you're going to hear at every convention with a webcomic panel.

1044
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:38,192
Rym: God, we ran a better webcomics panel in our room when I was completely loaded, mostly on vodka and, uh...

1045
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:44,858
Scott: And also a lot of it was talking about webcomic panels at conventions and how they're kind of crummy.

1046
01:00:45,581 --> 01:00:56,353
Rym: Also the fact that, very specifically, I keep picking on Mookie, but I gotta say, he is probably one of the most personable webcomic artists I've ever had the pleasure of running into.

1047
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:01,860
Scott: Yeah, you know, most webcomic artists in general seem fairly personable, you know?

1048
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:03,678
Scott: They're all kind of friendly, "Hey, what's going

1049
01:01:03,739 --> 01:01:03,800
Scott: on?".

1050
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:06,680
Rym: Well, I guess personable, but also very, I guess, outspoken and charismatic.

1051
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:09,179
Rym: I mean, a lot of them are somewhat shy or quiet or...

1052
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:10,699
Scott: There are shy and quiet ones, yeah.

1053
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:13,520
Scott: There aren't any, like, bastards, though, you know?

1054
01:01:14,043 --> 01:01:14,816
Rym: No, there really aren't.

1055
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:16,259
Rym: At least, I've never run into one.

1056
01:01:17,441 --> 01:01:24,459
Rym: Now, people said, I had numerous people say, that Brian Clevenger was a bastard, which was completely untrue when I finally met him.

1057
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:24,810
Rym: Yep.

1058
01:01:25,121 --> 01:01:26,059
Rym: I don't know where that came from.

1059
01:01:26,302 --> 01:01:26,797
Scott: I don't know either.

1060
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:30,020
Rym: A lot of people say Fred Gallagher is a bastard, which I don't think he's a bastard.

1061
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:32,500
Rym: I have my opinions, but he's not a bastard.

1062
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:33,780
Scott: No, he's not a mean guy.

1063
01:01:33,921 --> 01:01:34,778
Scott: If I went up to him and I said,

1064
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:34,860
Scott: "Hey."

1065
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:35,500
Scott: He's really friendly.

1066
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,415
Scott: Yeah, if I went up to him and said, "Hey," he'd be like, "Hey, what's

1067
01:01:37,515 --> 01:01:37,556
Scott: up?".

1068
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:47,213
Scott: But if I started saying things like, you know, "You're a pervert, you draw little girls in moe and shit," and he'd be all like, "Eh,

1069
01:01:47,234 --> 01:01:47,596
Scott: whatever.".

1070
01:01:48,401 --> 01:01:51,836
Rym: See, the thing is, if only we had Largo, because Largo would be like, "Ha ha,

1071
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:52,540
Rym: yeah!".

1072
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:55,600
Scott: Yeah, see, Largo, that's what we need in a webcomic artist.

1073
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:10,000
Rym: I always think Scott Johnson should get Rodney Caston and all those other people who were affiliated but are no longer affiliated due to trouble between artists and writers, and form the second-rate crew or something and go around causing trouble.

1074
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:13,598
Scott: The second-rate, the former webcomic writers of...

1075
01:02:14,041 --> 01:02:14,980
Rym: Yeah, something like that.

1076
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:16,480
Scott: Yeah, that'd be hilarious.

1077
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:24,300
Rym: But look forward to this roundtable when I finally put it on the air, because it was really, really good, and a lot of really cool people were there.

1078
01:02:24,721 --> 01:02:30,860
Rym: I don't remember who off the top of my head, because I don't read many of their webcomics, but I started reading many of them as a result.

1079
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,360
Scott: Yeah, I've pretty much been reading the same webcomics forever.

1080
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,271
Scott: I think the latest one I've added is Dr.

1081
01:02:36,311 --> 01:02:37,840
Scott: McNinja, which is awesome.

1082
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:38,890
Rym: Yeah, there was that Dr.

1083
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:39,720
Rym: McNinja cosplayer.

1084
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:40,540
Scott: Oh, he was awesome.

1085
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:41,160
Scott: He's in my flicker.

1086
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:42,618
Scott: That guy was the man.

1087
01:02:43,821 --> 01:02:47,880
Rym: Now, one other particularly noteworthy incident happened in the room.

1088
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,440
Rym: I mean, there were many funny things that happened in the room.

1089
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:53,540
Rym: Probably too many to ever talk about on the show, but I'm sure they'll come up...

1090
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:55,640
Scott: I don't remember 90% of the stuff that went on in the room.

1091
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:57,819
Scott: We should really set up some sort of giant...

1092
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:58,055
Rym: Webcam?

1093
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,680
Scott: Yeah, webcam-type device.

1094
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:09,259
Rym: You know, I find it funny that I drink and you don't, and I was quite drunk for most of Saturday night, and yet I remember more about the stuff that happened in the room than you.

1095
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:09,764
Scott: Eh.

1096
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:10,978
Scott: You know.

1097
01:03:11,561 --> 01:03:12,840
Scott: It's just all a blur, man.

1098
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:18,360
Scott: The stuff goes by so fast, I'm not really paying attention so much, I'm just kind of going with the flow, saying crazy shit.

1099
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:37,520
Rym: Though Saturday night, after we did all this stuff, and our voices are all about gone, and I'm completely tired and completely ripped, and Anime World Order finally shows up with a bunch of people, and we're gonna do our podcasting round table, which at this point, I was no longer awake enough to moderate properly.

1100
01:03:38,303 --> 01:03:40,600
Scott: And I was also pretty trashed.

1101
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:46,339
Rym: Yeah, plus I was no longer really drunk, I was just really tired and not so with it.

1102
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:48,460
Scott: I was ready to go to bed, basically.

1103
01:03:49,601 --> 01:03:53,360
Rym: Plus, Scott, I gotta say, you were very much sabotaging my attempts to moderate that thing.

1104
01:03:53,761 --> 01:04:07,459
Scott: Yeah, well, you see, the thing was, is I was like, okay, gotta not lose track, so I was like, alright, I'll do it, I'll do it chronologically, alright, I'll hold this thing in front of me, and I'll just go to the right, and that way I won't lose track of what's going on.

1105
01:04:08,304 --> 01:04:12,920
Scott: Yeah, that really- Even though I still, I think if you listen to it, you'll hear me like wander off, being like, huh?

1106
01:04:13,521 --> 01:04:17,079
Rym: Yeah, we're definitely probably not going to play the whole thing, but I think I will play choice bits.

1107
01:04:17,421 --> 01:04:19,579
Scott: Now, the choice- One particularly choice bit.

1108
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:34,460
Rym: The choices bit, which I don't think I'm going to put together the recording of it tonight, and I'm not going to tell the whole story of it tonight, but very simply, we had a long running disagreement with Anime World Order.

1109
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:43,140
Rym: Now, we love them, we're friends with them, there's a mutual respect, but we disagree with them often on anything that isn't- I don't know, at least we respect them, who knows what they really think of us.

1110
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:47,620
Rym: Well, we disagree with them on anime fandom, though we tend to agree with them on anime.

1111
01:04:47,982 --> 01:04:49,160
Scott: Yeah, at least for the most part.

1112
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:49,757
Rym: For the most part.

1113
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:56,460
Rym: Now, it came to the point where Daryl starts talking about this whole thing.

1114
01:04:56,580 --> 01:05:06,460
Rym: He starts getting really into it, and he starts giving this really, really, really rousing kind of, this is my epic speech of this kind, and he stands up with the microphone, and he's talking and talking.

1115
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:11,120
Rym: Now, a little backstory here, there is a device called a clown pistol.

1116
01:05:12,021 --> 01:05:14,760
Rym: At least this is what Anime World Order calls this device.

1117
01:05:15,382 --> 01:05:17,720
Rym: It is basically a gun-shaped explosive.

1118
01:05:18,621 --> 01:05:28,800
Scott: Well, you know, we weren't 100% sure what it was before the con, and then I figured it out by searching the internets a bit, like the day before we left for the convention.

1119
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:42,359
Scott: I think it was actually Thursday I found out, mostly, what it was, but it wasn't until it was used and displayed before my eyes that I was 100% comprehending the nature of this device.

1120
01:05:42,840 --> 01:06:15,500
Rym: Now, you will hear about this again when I play that round table, and I will go into great detail of exactly what happened, but suffice to say, Daryl is standing up, and he's looking into the air with his arm extended, and he's giving this rousing, like, this is what I have to say about this con, and what I have to say about Otakon, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and thus, I can sum it up in exactly three words, and he reaches behind into his back pocket, and then he comes forth, and he yells, "Sic semper tyrannis," and he shoots me in the fucking face with a clown pistol.

1121
01:06:15,902 --> 01:06:24,657
Scott: Yep, and then I'm like, the only thing I could think, 'cause I couldn't move, I was reclined, I was tired, and I'm like, "I hope he doesn't have another clown

1122
01:06:24,717 --> 01:06:25,099
Scott: pistol.".

1123
01:06:25,402 --> 01:06:25,549
Rym: Bang!

1124
01:06:26,527 --> 01:06:26,919
Rym: He did.

1125
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,480
Scott: He did indeed have another clown pistol.

1126
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:36,900
Rym: Now then the room goes silent, and everyone's just kind of like... And then I start laughing hysterically.

1127
01:06:38,061 --> 01:06:42,298
Rym: I think there was a tiny moment when everyone wondered, "Was that over the

1128
01:06:42,338 --> 01:06:42,680
Rym: line?".

1129
01:06:43,204 --> 01:06:45,460
Rym: And I guess the answer is no, that was nowhere near the line.

1130
01:06:45,521 --> 01:06:46,719
Scott: Not even close to the line.

1131
01:06:47,702 --> 01:06:52,300
Rym: In fact, I gained so much respect for Daryl Surratt after that moment.

1132
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:59,460
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know the line would be like, if all the guys he brought with him held us down and they tried to rape us in the butt, that would be the line.

1133
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:03,600
Rym: Now, would that be the inclusive or the exclusive line?

1134
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,020
Scott: That would be beyond the line.

1135
01:07:05,501 --> 01:07:07,320
Scott: That would be the first thing beyond the line.

1136
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:13,919
Rym: Now, despite the fact that I got some, I guess, flash powder in my eye, and it hurt because I think the wadding hit me in the nipple.

1137
01:07:14,268 --> 01:07:14,660
Scott: Yeah.

1138
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:27,758
Rym: And I was covered in this confetti, and the fact that they had the utter testicular fortitude to do the kind of thing to us that we tend to do to other people and beat us to it at Otakon.

1139
01:07:28,841 --> 01:07:39,636
Scott: Yeah, I think what it was is, from the disagreement we had prior to the con, is that they were sort of like grr against us, and we were like, "Hey, what's

1140
01:07:39,757 --> 01:07:39,837
Scott: up?"

1141
01:07:39,877 --> 01:07:40,259
Scott: to them.

1142
01:07:40,701 --> 01:07:43,160
Scott: So we were totally not having the bad feelings.

1143
01:07:43,701 --> 01:07:45,719
Rym: We didn't expect an assassination attempt.

1144
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:53,480
Scott: Yeah, it's like you think you're good friends with someone and you're just having good fun with them, and then they secretly want to shoot you with clown pistols.

1145
01:07:53,820 --> 01:08:02,931
Rym: Now, I think it helped that they talked about clown pistols a couple times on the show, and then we kept talking about clown pistols because the words "clown pistol" are hilarious to me.

1146
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:10,896
Rym: Also, the fact that the first utterance I ever heard of "clown pistol" was effectively, "And Daryl shot me in the back of the head with a clown pistol, you

1147
01:08:10,937 --> 01:08:11,218
Rym: fucker.".

1148
01:08:12,342 --> 01:08:16,138
Rym: And then there was another story where he almost shot the guest at some con with a clown pistol.

1149
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:20,639
Rym: And if you Google search for clown pistol, Anime World Order is the number one link.

1150
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:21,163
Scott: God.

1151
01:08:23,362 --> 01:08:25,540
Scott: They've got the, they got a monopoly on clown pistols.

1152
01:08:26,279 --> 01:08:30,939
Rym: So good God, I will play the footage from that at a later date.

1153
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:31,740
Scott: All right.

1154
01:08:32,321 --> 01:08:38,520
Rym: Now, other than that, the con itself, we have a whole bunch of little things I guess to cover, all the miscellaneous stuff that didn't really fit anywhere.

1155
01:08:39,261 --> 01:08:53,819
Rym: Now, when we interviewed, well, attempted to interview Jim Vowles way back, and then we did the text interview with him by email, one of the things he said was that the food is going to be substantially better, substantially cheaper, Aramark is going to put forth the effort to make the food at the con fantastic.

1156
01:08:54,279 --> 01:08:55,499
Scott: Well, he didn't lie.

1157
01:08:55,960 --> 01:09:04,319
Rym: Yes, the food was at least three times better than it has ever been, and the prices were at least an order of magnitude more reasonable.

1158
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:13,180
Scott: Yep, they definitely, you know, I think the con, the Aramark definitely finally understood what they have to do to sell food to Otaku.

1159
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:19,080
Scott: You know, they had ramune, and they had a thing that sold sushi, and they were selling all sorts.

1160
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:20,256
Scott: They were selling pocky.

1161
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,839
Rym: Now, here's the thing, and we took pictures of this.

1162
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:32,760
Rym: We thought, all right, we gotta go check out this food situation, because Jim said they're trying real hard, and in fact, Wikipedia even linked to that interview we did with him, talking about how the food's going to be different at Otakon.

1163
01:09:33,462 --> 01:09:39,859
Rym: And the first sign we see is ramune, five dollars, pocky, like five dollars.

1164
01:09:40,361 --> 01:09:49,380
Scott: Now granted, compared to the prices that Aramark has had in the past, that's fantastic, but compared to what it should cost, not really so good.

1165
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,920
Rym: Good God, five dollars for a ramune.

1166
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:53,300
Rym: That is insane.

1167
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:56,420
Rym: That is more than alcohol in a bar.

1168
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:06,620
Scott: Yeah, I mean, if you go to the local anime store where they have a little mini fridge full of ramune, you can get a six-pack of ramune for like five dollars.

1169
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:10,380
Scott: So they're selling one bottle of ramune for five dollars.

1170
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:26,497
Scott: And sure, there's a bunch of otaku there who are all about ramune, and they don't know how to get it in their area, and it's like a rare treat for them, so they're willing to shell out five bucks, and they don't realize that it's actually not that much money to get ramune in pocky.

1171
01:10:27,661 --> 01:10:53,378
Scott: And there are a lot of people there who aren't smart enough, or they just don't know that they can go and cross the skywalk to go to the food court, or they're just so lazy that they'll pay more and sit in one place to get food rather than walk over across the skywalk to get cheaper food, but really, they tried and they did a good job to improve, but the prices still gotta come way down before I'm gonna buy food in the BCC.

1172
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:59,160
Rym: The closest thing to a deal they had was a six dollar lunch combo, and it was like a burger and a drink and something.

1173
01:11:00,442 --> 01:11:09,418
Rym: But while that might be kind of a reasonable price, from what I gathered from just kind of talking to people, the burgers were pretty much the same subpar kind of burgers they always have.

1174
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:26,119
Scott: Yeah, and meanwhile, over in the food court at the little mall, you can get an awesome pizza, an awesome sandwich, a hagandaz, an awesome bowl of noodles and Chinese food, all kinds of awesome stuff for the same price.

1175
01:11:27,121 --> 01:11:43,259
Rym: Yep, and also they had sushi at the Aramark's, which I was really, really leery of, but I saw some other people who got it and I looked at it, and it was okay, it was like five or six bucks, but the thing is, for five or six bucks, you could get so much more better sushi again in that food court.

1176
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:53,360
Scott: Yeah, you know, they just really, I don't know if it costs them more to get food, because it might- It's just Aramark really, really wants to make a whole bunch of money off Otakon.

1177
01:11:54,120 --> 01:12:09,399
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, if they rethought the prices, I mean, if they did sell the stuff at a normal price, and they still made a profit at the normal price, they'd make a shit ton of money, because if they had that and their food was just as good as the stuff in the food court, I'd totally buy it.

1178
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:19,679
Rym: Well, the thing is, the food really just is never really that good, and partly because they seem to do it in the typical kind of cook it ahead of time and keep it warm in a thing for people way.

1179
01:12:20,121 --> 01:12:24,297
Scott: Yeah, I think, I don't know, I just, I don't think they have the capacity to do anything else though.

1180
01:12:25,043 --> 01:12:25,680
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

1181
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:26,333
Scott: It's just how they're set up.

1182
01:12:28,201 --> 01:12:31,679
Scott: It's like going to a baseball stadium and you're like, "Hey, can you change the

1183
01:12:31,719 --> 01:12:31,920
Scott: food?".

1184
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:34,100
Scott: And it's like, no, it's sort of a permanent installation.

1185
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,699
Rym: Yeah, luckily, no one really stops us from bringing our own stuff in.

1186
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:55,340
Scott: Here's the thing though, I go, you know, I've been to baseball games many times, I've been to many sporting events in my life, not recently, but, you know, years and years ago, and compared to like, you know, the baseball stadium next door, and the football stadium next door, the prices on the food were high.

1187
01:12:55,740 --> 01:13:06,496
Scott: I mean, you can get a hot dog for three or four dollars at a baseball stadium, you know, a good hot dog, relatively good, like a big long one, and you can get all sorts of toppings on it.

1188
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:09,920
Scott: Here, that didn't even get you a ramené, it's like what the hell.

1189
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,300
Rym: Yeah, granted, the ramené was very much overpriced compared to everything else.

1190
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:14,020
Scott: That is true.

1191
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:21,280
Rym: So the food was better, but I would recommend to anyone going to Otakon to avoid Aramark and go to the food court down the street.

1192
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:27,160
Scott: Yes, do not buy food in the convention center at Otakon, at least not in this past year.

1193
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:28,939
Scott: Maybe next year, who knows?

1194
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:36,299
Rym: Now of course, the final bit we usually talk about is the closing ceremonies at Otakon, because unlike most other cons, they're kind of a big deal here.

1195
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:41,539
Scott: Yeah, the feedback session is also kind of a big deal, but we missed it because you're doing our panel.

1196
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:52,859
Rym: Yep, now I'll note at this time that normally at the end of Otakon, we're yelling and screaming and causing trouble, but this year, as we've said before, we both completely lost our voices on Sunday.

1197
01:13:53,601 --> 01:14:01,239
Rym: We drugged ourselves up in order to do our panel, and we pretty much couldn't talk for the rest of that day until like the beginning of the next day.

1198
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:04,360
Scott: Yep, so that kind of ruled out giving any feedback.

1199
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:14,120
Rym: Which also leaves a hilarious story as to what happened to the front row crew when the two fearless leaders, Scott and I, are unable to communicate.

1200
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:18,119
Rym: Good God, do we have a whole episode about that.

1201
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:22,960
Scott: But anyway, we went to the closing ceremonies, which were typical closing ceremonies.

1202
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:31,579
Rym: Yep, now the big thing that makes Otakon's closing ceremonies, in my opinion, great is that one, they have the minor entertainment just to keep the crowd busy until they get the information they need.

1203
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:39,260
Rym: Then right away, they announce all the winners of all the contests at the con, and they show all of the winning anime music videos.

1204
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:40,439
Scott: That's the reason to go.

1205
01:14:40,602 --> 01:14:41,376
Scott: This started last year.

1206
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:42,520
Scott: That's the reason most people are there.

1207
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:49,460
Rym: Now I gotta say, last year I was very much overwhelmed, as opposed to underwhelmed, by the AMV winners.

1208
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:56,300
Rym: They were good enough to where I thought that maybe, maybe, anime music videos are making a comeback in terms of quality.

1209
01:14:56,420 --> 01:15:04,580
Scott: Yeah, they weren't as good as our favorite all-time music videos, but they were definitely quality music videos worthy of being shown at the beginning of anime club news.

1210
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:10,599
Rym: In fact, last year, one video was kind of meh, it was this Naruto fighting one, but all the rest were really good.

1211
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:15,400
Rym: And I gotta say that the 25/25 video is one of my favorite AMVs ever.

1212
01:15:15,661 --> 01:15:16,579
Scott: It's a really good video.

1213
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:24,199
Rym: Of course, I find it sad that people didn't vote for that one, that the judge of the AMV contest had to basically give the special award to it.

1214
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:36,320
Rym: But anyway, this year, other than one video, which was a direct parody of one of the winners from last year, they did the same EVA video with the same song, only it was Tazuma Gidao.

1215
01:15:37,422 --> 01:15:39,900
Rym: Other than that, they were decidedly underwhelming.

1216
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:42,600
Scott: Yeah, they seem pretty average videos.

1217
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:49,980
Scott: Like, I remember, because the way we rate music videos is from back in the day when we had to pick music videos to show at the beginning of anime club.

1218
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:50,959
Rym: Now, consider this.

1219
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:56,160
Rym: This is a large club that has the internet, knows all about AMVs.

1220
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:00,720
Rym: You've got to show them something amazing every week or they're going to be mad.

1221
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:05,298
Scott: Yeah, I mean, if you show them an average crap AMV, they're going to sit there and be grumbly and leave.

1222
01:16:06,182 --> 01:16:11,720
Scott: The trick with the AMVs is we showed them at the beginning, and most people would stay for at least the AMVs.

1223
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:17,518
Scott: And if you could get entertaining AMVs, that means they wouldn't leave before the AMVs were over.

1224
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:23,600
Scott: So then you would turn on the first episode of the show right after the last AMV, and you'd get the people.

1225
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:27,460
Scott: If you could get them through the AMVs with good stuff, they would stay for the show.

1226
01:16:27,602 --> 01:16:28,239
Scott: That was the goal.

1227
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:32,880
Rym: Now, over the years, I mean, we have our opinions as to the best AMVs ever, generally.

1228
01:16:33,943 --> 01:16:35,780
Scott: We need an episode on anime music videos.

1229
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:39,280
Rym: Yeah, but it seems that by showing them to the club, most people seem to agree.

1230
01:16:39,601 --> 01:16:43,080
Rym: And there were some amazing freaking videos that have come out over the years.

1231
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:54,240
Rym: And it just seems like while the average quality of videos has gone up dramatically in the last three or four years, the quality of the best videos doesn't seem to have gone anywhere and in fact may have decreased.

1232
01:16:55,681 --> 01:16:58,600
Rym: But then again, we haven't been too up on AMVs lately.

1233
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:04,419
Rym: I mean, I used to religiously watch the winners of every con, and for the last two years, I really haven't had the time to do that.

1234
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:05,680
Scott: Yeah, it's just too much effort.

1235
01:17:06,341 --> 01:17:13,760
Scott: But basically, we used to watch a whole mess of AMVs every week to try and pick good ones for the show, I mean, for the club meeting.

1236
01:17:15,361 --> 01:17:22,460
Scott: And the ones from Otakon last year would have easily been selected to be played at the beginning of any anime club meeting ever.

1237
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:26,160
Scott: The ones from this year would have been on the second tier.

1238
01:17:26,281 --> 01:17:28,840
Scott: Like, we would have chosen them if we didn't find anything better.

1239
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:38,700
Rym: Yeah, I don't know, I mean, it's not Otakon's fault, but honestly, the AMV contest, if those were the winners, I am so glad I didn't even try to see the AMV contest.

1240
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:41,080
Scott: Yeah, I pretty much never go see the AMV contest.

1241
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:49,259
Scott: I mean, I think I sat in it for maybe five videos at my first or second Otakon, and then I just never went to it again.

1242
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:54,700
Scott: And I'm really glad they showed the winners at the closing ceremonies, because closing ceremonies is not a waste of time.

1243
01:17:54,921 --> 01:17:59,760
Scott: It doesn't take very long, and I can see the great AMVs without wasting a lot of hours.

1244
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:17,280
Rym: Plus, I think it takes some strain off of the AMV contest room, because now, a lot of the people like me who would go to the AMV contest just because they want to see those few gems, now can just go to the closing ceremonies and see that, so they will not go to the AMV room, and then other people who might not be able to fit in can now see them.

1245
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:18,780
Scott: Isn't that what it's really all about?

1246
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:25,299
Scott: You know, you go to dig and you go to FARC to see the best stories of the day without having to go read every single thing on CNN.

1247
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:30,238
Rym: Yep, but then again, some people go to Total FARC and they dig around for like 20 pages.

1248
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:31,378
Scott: That's good for them.

1249
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:31,940
Scott: Okay.

1250
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:33,780
Rym: Well, it's also good for us because they're like filters.

1251
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:34,415
Scott: They are.

1252
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:44,960
Scott: And Otakon is also a filter, a very good one, because while the winners of the AMV contest might not have impressed us in our hard-ass, very judgmental of AMV ways.

1253
01:18:45,282 --> 01:18:46,099
Rym: Us judgmental?

1254
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:46,437
Rym: Never.

1255
01:18:47,441 --> 01:18:51,940
Scott: I would probably agree that those were the best ones from what they had to choose from.

1256
01:18:52,382 --> 01:19:02,719
Rym: Now also, the closing ceremonies are very important because typically every year they will announce the dates of the next Otakon, which means half of the room pulls out cell phones and starts getting hotel rooms.

1257
01:19:03,244 --> 01:19:03,520
Scott: Awesome.

1258
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:09,228
Rym: This year, they announced that next year's Otakon, Otakon 2007, will be the weekend of July 20th.

1259
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:11,873
Scott: That's way early, because Otakon- No, no, no.

1260
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:15,456
Rym: While people originally grumbled, "Hey, why is it so

1261
01:19:15,537 --> 01:19:15,798
Rym: early?".

1262
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:25,499
Rym: Historically, Otakon has always been around the end of July, the beginning of August, and it's a very recent trend that it was moving to later August, and they have rectified this.

1263
01:19:26,021 --> 01:19:26,166
Scott: Mm-hmm.

1264
01:19:27,321 --> 01:19:28,900
Scott: I don't know, because we've been to how many Otacons?

1265
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:29,380
Scott: Five?

1266
01:19:29,642 --> 01:19:29,728
Rym: Yeah.

1267
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:31,840
Scott: And they've all been- No, they haven't.

1268
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:33,100
Scott: Middle of August, early August.

1269
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,560
Rym: The first one we went to was early August.

1270
01:19:34,925 --> 01:19:35,060
Rym: Yeah.

1271
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:36,540
Rym: And before that, they were late July.

1272
01:19:36,901 --> 01:19:37,130
Rym: Mm-hmm.

1273
01:19:37,763 --> 01:19:43,599
Rym: And this really... I mean, actually, I think the dates are better in many ways, because now it's in the middle of summer as opposed to the end.

1274
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:47,440
Rym: A lot of high school kids won't have band camp in the way or anything.

1275
01:19:48,022 --> 01:19:58,740
Scott: Yeah, I think the real thing that they have to worry about is they can't be in confliction with, you know, any... I guess E3 doesn't exist anymore, but the San Diego Comic-Con can't conflict with that.

1276
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:03,960
Scott: They can't conflict with any of the other major East Coast anime conventions.

1277
01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:09,100
Rym: The thing is, it's hard to conflict with them, because the major East Coast anime conventions are, a lot of them, winter cons.

1278
01:20:09,620 --> 01:20:10,379
Scott: Yup, that is true.

1279
01:20:10,781 --> 01:20:15,292
Rym: Or they're in that other circle of cons, where the people who go to those don't go to Otakon and Katsucon.

1280
01:20:15,665 --> 01:20:15,837
Scott: Yup.

1281
01:20:16,042 --> 01:20:17,279
Scott: They can't conflict with PAX.

1282
01:20:17,864 --> 01:20:19,080
Scott: They can't... You know, there's a lot of things...

1283
01:20:19,121 --> 01:20:20,279
Rym: They can conflict with PAX.

1284
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:25,260
Rym: So few people from the East Coast go to PAX, compared to how many West Coasters go to Otakon.

1285
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:26,780
Rym: It wouldn't... I don't think it would have any impact.

1286
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:28,000
Scott: There are rumors of PAX East.

1287
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:28,737
Rym: Oh, I know.

1288
01:20:29,101 --> 01:20:29,251
Rym: I know.

1289
01:20:29,761 --> 01:20:30,378
Rym: The thing is, PAX...

1290
01:20:30,682 --> 01:20:34,540
Scott: You gotta watch out for these baseball and football... Well, not football games.

1291
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:36,880
Scott: There wouldn't be a football game that time of year, but the baseball games...

1292
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:39,760
Rym: Yeah, having the baseball games at the same time as Otakon was kind of annoying.

1293
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:43,320
Rym: I heard a lot of stories of baseball players causing problems and heckling people.

1294
01:20:43,743 --> 01:20:43,829
Scott: Yeah.

1295
01:20:44,327 --> 01:20:46,520
Scott: Well, at least... Not baseball players, baseball fans.

1296
01:20:46,781 --> 01:20:47,397
Rym: Yeah, baseball fans.

1297
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:51,379
Rym: Though, baseball players... Apparently, one of the teams was staying in our hotel room.

1298
01:20:52,202 --> 01:20:53,060
Scott: In our hotel room?

1299
01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:53,520
Rym: Well, in our...

1300
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:54,157
Scott: It's news to me.

1301
01:20:54,461 --> 01:20:55,200
Rym: In our hotel.

1302
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:56,619
Scott: The whole team was in our room?

1303
01:20:56,860 --> 01:20:57,839
Rym: Well, for the Gay Orgy.

1304
01:20:58,060 --> 01:20:58,104
Rym: Oh.

1305
01:20:58,703 --> 01:20:58,960
Scott: Okay.

1306
01:20:59,301 --> 01:21:00,179
Rym: But they were in the hotel.

1307
01:21:00,801 --> 01:21:05,939
Rym: So, some day there were a lot of baseball fans, ready for the big game, wondering what the hell all of us were.

1308
01:21:06,285 --> 01:21:06,476
Scott: Yeah.

1309
01:21:06,841 --> 01:21:09,440
Rym: And a lot of them were grumbling about how the hotel was sold out and crowded.

1310
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:12,700
Scott: Yeah, it really doesn't bother me that, you know, the baseball fans are there.

1311
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:22,740
Scott: I mean, it might have bothered some other people, not me, but definitely the Inner Harbor area of Baltimore can barely support the people, the number of people for Otakon.

1312
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:28,020
Scott: Having a whole 'nother pile of people there for baseball really kind of stretched.

1313
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:42,612
Rym: I mean, even Sunday, we went to try to get lunch at the food court and it was insanely crowded and there were baseball fans wandering around and they were talking loudly in the way that people who aren't from an area talk when they're mad and they want people to overhear them.

1314
01:21:43,383 --> 01:21:45,020
Rym: They were doing the, "What the hell is this?

1315
01:21:45,081 --> 01:21:46,040
Rym: This place is so crowded.

1316
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:46,900
Rym: How can people eat here?

1317
01:21:46,940 --> 01:21:48,000
Rym: What's up with this stupid town?

1318
01:21:50,768 --> 01:21:51,300
Rym: I just laughed.

1319
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:51,750
Scott: Yeah.

1320
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:56,799
Scott: Now, that is one thing that Aramark has an advantage over, is that the food court is very crowded.

1321
01:21:57,100 --> 01:22:05,537
Scott: If Aramark had decent food and they lowered that price, I would be very willing, I would in fact be willing to pay slightly more than the food court just because they would have a seat.

1322
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:12,420
Rym: Yeah, but I guess the fact that I'd rather go to the food court, despite the fact that I usually end up standing somewhere eating, says a lot.

1323
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:13,479
Scott: It does say a lot.

1324
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:13,857
Scott: All right.

1325
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:21,660
Rym: Now, I guess the final bits we'd like to say is that one, while it might have sounded that we complained a lot, we complain a lot about every con we go to.

1326
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:36,399
Scott: Well, I think what it is when we ever talk about anything, an anime, a manga, a video game, anything we ever talk about, we always point out the things that are wrong with it and then everything else is just fantastic, but we don't really say all the fantastic things so much.

1327
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:39,560
Scott: We only kind of point out the bad things and let everything else go unsaid.

1328
01:22:40,131 --> 01:22:40,279
Rym: Yep.

1329
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:51,060
Rym: So suffice to say, while this was probably not the best Otakon I've been to, all things considered, it was a very good Otakon and I had a fantastic time and once again, Otakon pulled off the amazing.

1330
01:22:51,504 --> 01:22:51,576
Rym: Yep.

1331
01:22:51,820 --> 01:22:57,857
Rym: I would say this is- This was easily seven and a half to eight out of ten for an Otakon.

1332
01:22:58,501 --> 01:22:59,339
Rym: Easily eight out of ten.

1333
01:22:59,562 --> 01:23:00,159
Scott: I'd agree with that.

1334
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:12,440
Scott: I would say that it's the third best Otakon I've been to and you know, but that's not counting the fact that it was boosted heavily by the podcasting awesomeness that we generated for ourselves.

1335
01:23:12,580 --> 01:23:17,360
Scott: I'm only judging by the things Otakon provided and not my personal experience at the convention.

1336
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:26,600
Rym: I had more fun at this Otakon than I have had at any Otakon, but the con itself did not provide as much as other Otakons have provided, but it was still a fantastic con.

1337
01:23:27,082 --> 01:23:43,280
Scott: Judging by the fun I had, I would definitely say it's the second best Otakon probably, but judging by what the con did, the con itself, regardless of who is attending it, I would agree with Rym, seven and a half, eight, something around there.

1338
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:46,879
Rym: Now we got a few bits from Jim Vowles, the chair of Otakon this year.

1339
01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:54,496
Rym: One he mentioned to us that I was talking about how there were some crises with the staff and I wasn't sure if I should talk about it and what was going on.

1340
01:23:54,517 --> 01:23:59,838
Rym: and I wasn't too sure what happened because it was mostly me like talking to staffers on the side or overhearing things.

1341
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:06,738
Rym: But the major crises were that one, some kid got lost or separated from his parents or something like that.

1342
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:07,339
Scott: Good job, kid.

1343
01:24:07,721 --> 01:24:22,480
Rym: And the kid's parents were mad because the con didn't have a con-wide paging system, despite the fact that they announced clearly and loudly everywhere that there was no paging system and that the first page of the con book was, was it the first page?

1344
01:24:22,761 --> 01:24:23,062
Rym: Now it was.

1345
01:24:23,143 --> 01:24:30,340
Rym: one of the pages in the con book is basically a whole page spread saying that there is no way to page anyone at the convention.

1346
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:35,440
Rym: But the parents were pissed about this and the police had to kind of help find the kid, even though nothing happened.

1347
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:36,259
Rym: The kid was fine.

1348
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:37,380
Scott: Of course the kid's gonna be fine.

1349
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:38,560
Scott: What's gonna happen to him at Otakon?

1350
01:24:38,801 --> 01:24:40,820
Rym: Yeah, Otakon's like the safest place in Baltimore.

1351
01:24:41,060 --> 01:24:48,660
Scott: Yeah, unless he walks out onto the street of Baltimore and gets hit by a car or starts bothering homeless bums, he's gonna be fine, you know?

1352
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:48,989
Scott: Yep.

1353
01:24:49,140 --> 01:25:00,477
Rym: And the other thing was that Gaia Online, or at least someone who claimed to be working with Gaia Online, decided to start hawking items of value over the balcony in the Otter Bean lobby.

1354
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:07,280
Scott: Yeah, I was there when the guy was doing it and it looked like they were mostly bundled up t-shirts, you know, the kind that they throw into the stands at baseball games.

1355
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:09,120
Rym: Incredibly stupid idea.

1356
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:16,300
Rym: I would hope that whoever did that was banned from Otakon because good God was that dangerous and good God that it caused nothing but problems.

1357
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:22,520
Scott: Yeah, the thing that really I was puzzled at was I was standing there watching this guy wondering, "What the hell is that guy doing?

1358
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:24,673
Scott: Wow, that guy needs to stop doing that

1359
01:25:24,834 --> 01:25:25,197
Scott: now!".

1360
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:32,940
Scott: And there's like a security guy standing there just kind of looking, there's people crowding around him, people crowding around the area to which he's throwing goods.

1361
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:36,500
Rym: That didn't look like Otakon's staff security, that looked like BCC security.

1362
01:25:36,780 --> 01:25:41,940
Scott: Yeah, but then, alright I'm not done yet, I saw some staffers go over and say something to him, right?

1363
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:52,250
Scott: And then he talked a bit for like a few seconds, then he kind of continued his business a little bit and then I walked away, so I don't really know what happened or what

1364
01:25:52,270 --> 01:25:52,791
Rym: was said,

1365
01:25:52,811 --> 01:25:59,760
Scott: but what should have happened is the Otakon staff person shouldn't have even had to talk to that guy.

1366
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:04,973
Scott: They should have just gone to the BCC staff and said, "Grab that man and take him outside and take away his badge

1367
01:26:05,054 --> 01:26:05,297
Scott: now.".

1368
01:26:05,844 --> 01:26:06,720
Scott: That's what they should have done.

1369
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:08,120
Rym: Well, no, that's not what I would have done.

1370
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:08,940
Scott: That's what I would have done.

1371
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:09,046
Scott: No.

1372
01:26:09,323 --> 01:26:09,892
Scott: I've been like, "You're

1373
01:26:09,913 --> 01:26:10,177
Scott: done.".

1374
01:26:10,401 --> 01:26:12,500
Rym: Scott, you've never been staff or anything at a con.

1375
01:26:12,763 --> 01:26:12,849
Rym: Yeah.

1376
01:26:13,222 --> 01:26:13,400
Rym: Ever.

1377
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:23,697
Rym: What I would have done, the thing is, I have this staff instinct, like this security instinct now, and it was bad at AnimeNext when I'd see punk kids doing something.

1378
01:26:23,717 --> 01:26:35,471
Rym: that is obviously not a good idea and there's no staff around, but I'm there and I have the instinct from other cons of, "Stop them, grab that kid, prevent this from happening, yell at them, do whatever I need to

1379
01:26:35,532 --> 01:26:35,633
Rym: do.".

1380
01:26:36,261 --> 01:26:41,260
Rym: And when I saw this guy hawking stuff over the balcony, my instinct was to go stop him.

1381
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:46,820
Rym: But obviously I wasn't staff, I'm just some guy at Otakon, so I wasn't about to do anything.

1382
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:58,374
Rym: But what I would have done is I would have gone right up there, I would have tapped him on the shoulder, forced my way through the crowd, and I would have basically said, "You need to stop this right now and come with

1383
01:26:58,495 --> 01:26:58,656
Rym: me.".

1384
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,540
Rym: Then I just would have kind of let the crowd dissipate.

1385
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:03,880
Rym: I wouldn't have said anything to the crowd.

1386
01:27:04,121 --> 01:27:12,580
Rym: I would have taken him away, make sure anyone who had stuff to throw was also taken away, and then if the crowd didn't disperse on its own, I would have dealt with that separately.

1387
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:21,140
Rym: But the mystery of what's going on, what happened, probably would have been enough for that crowd to stop stampeding and over the course of the next five minutes disappear.

1388
01:27:22,348 --> 01:27:22,660
Scott: Mm, maybe.

1389
01:27:23,862 --> 01:27:24,758
Scott: But yeah, seriously.

1390
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:42,358
Rym: I wouldn't have immediately taken away his badge, I would have talked to him and figured out the level of how much he had thought this through, whether or not he had thought to ask for permission, why he thought this was a good idea, and then I would explain to him why it was a bad idea and why he probably should never try to do something like that again ever.

1391
01:27:43,061 --> 01:27:50,739
Scott: All I'm saying is that they should have stopped him in a more immediate fashion than what I saw.

1392
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:57,100
Scott: When I was at an amazement- Of course, I was standing there for maybe 10 seconds, so who knows my memory versus what happened.

1393
01:27:57,300 --> 01:28:10,220
Rym: True, but when I was at an amazement and a stampede of people who had formed a conga line, ran past me, I ran as fast as I could to get to the front of them and stop them before that turned into something dangerous.

1394
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:12,018
Rym: All right.

1395
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:22,380
Rym: Now the other thing was that they originally reported, it seemed like there weren't many staff at Otakon this year at all, and they reported originally on the website that there were in fact fewer staff by the numbers.

1396
01:28:22,740 --> 01:28:29,886
Rym: It turns out, according to the gym, that was a typo, there were in fact more staff at Otakon 2006 than there were at Otakon 2005.

1397
01:28:29,886 --> 01:28:30,099
Rym: Awesome.

1398
01:28:30,281 --> 01:28:32,360
Rym: However, there was a shortage of gophers.

1399
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:38,699
Rym: As a result, a number of staffers were stuck doing gopher jobs, which meant that there were fewer staff to go around.

1400
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:47,720
Rym: So while the total number of staff people- There were more people who have the authority to make decisions or at least deal with situations.

1401
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:50,800
Scott: But the staff power meter was lower overall.

1402
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:57,699
Rym: Plus it took about 12 staff members to deal with the Rams head, and it took staff to deal with the arena and all that.

1403
01:28:58,080 --> 01:28:58,697
Scott: Yep, yep, yep.

1404
01:28:59,681 --> 01:29:02,076
Scott: Yeah, I think they're gonna have to do something to-.

1405
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,080
Rym: Well, Otakon is different from other cons.

1406
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:14,920
Rym: They need so many staffers that you can't have the awesome, super dedicated people filling every staff position, because you're not going to find 500 or 600 people like that willing to work Otakon.

1407
01:29:14,940 --> 01:29:20,460
Scott: What I'm just saying is that they need to do is find some way of getting more people to become gophers.

1408
01:29:21,483 --> 01:29:23,120
Rym: Well they give gophers a lot of incentives.

1409
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:33,610
Scott: They do give them a lot of incentives, but I think what they just need to do is they need to make it known, "Hey, you poor kids with no monies, you can come here for almost free if you do

1410
01:29:33,671 --> 01:29:33,913
Scott: work.".

1411
01:29:34,922 --> 01:29:38,178
Scott: I don't think they proclaim it loudly enough that it's an option.

1412
01:29:39,102 --> 01:29:44,400
Rym: I don't think they could get away with what some other cons do, where they wander around recruiting gophers at the con the whole time.

1413
01:29:44,700 --> 01:29:46,480
Scott: Yeah, definitely they should not do that.

1414
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:49,980
Scott: I see other cons doing that and I go, "Ugh, why didn't you do this before the

1415
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:50,060
Scott: con?".

1416
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:52,260
Rym: It worked really well at Animazement.

1417
01:29:52,761 --> 01:30:05,019
Rym: It worked okay at Katsucon, except that while I was doing security and it did pretty well, it seems like a lot of the people they recruited would get their little security badge and then immediately disappear into the crowd and not do their job.

1418
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:06,384
Rym: Yeah.

1419
01:30:08,161 --> 01:30:13,760
Rym: It's real tough to find quality people, because you need to have someone who can make snap character judgments, and even then you could be wrong.

1420
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:17,040
Scott: Yeah, it is tough to find quality people, especially at the convention.

1421
01:30:17,260 --> 01:30:34,440
Scott: I think, I don't know how it should be done, but there are definitely people out there who will make good gophers, and there are people who want to be staff or just don't know they want to be staff because they haven't thought about it, and there's just not to find some way to get the word out there and let people know that this is an option.

1422
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:38,740
Scott: You can work at the convention and save a lot of money if you want to go there.

1423
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:39,700
Rym: Well, it's like panelists.

1424
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:46,100
Rym: A lot of the people who I think could run really good, really professional panels don't realize that you can actually get a panel at a con.

1425
01:30:47,009 --> 01:30:47,159
Scott: Yep.

1426
01:30:47,342 --> 01:30:48,000
Rym: It's the same thing.

1427
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:49,140
Scott: It's exactly the same thing.

1428
01:30:49,281 --> 01:30:51,652
Rym: And of course, while people say, "Well, why don't you and Scott be

1429
01:30:51,672 --> 01:30:52,114
Rym: gophers?"

1430
01:30:52,114 --> 01:30:56,920
Rym: ", I am well beyond the point in my life where I'm going to do the menial work of a convention.

1431
01:30:57,020 --> 01:31:03,418
Rym: Not to sound like that, but there's no way I'm going to stand at a registration desk for eight hours.

1432
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:09,440
Scott: Yeah, I'd much rather go to the convention with a press badge or something like that than go as a gopher.

1433
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:16,094
Rym: Yeah, which honestly, it's probably more work being staff, but it's also so much more rewarding to me.

1434
01:31:17,341 --> 01:31:24,340
Rym: Of course, there's also the issue that when I needed money to go to cons, I was always able to scrape by and I never needed to become a gopher.

1435
01:31:24,980 --> 01:31:27,339
Scott: Yep, but you probably would have if it really came down to it.

1436
01:31:27,820 --> 01:31:32,514
Scott: It's like at the bottom of the list, it's like, "Huh, I really can't stay here unless I...".

1437
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:42,300
Rym: If Nuri hadn't bought me food at the first Otakon we went to, I probably would have been a gopher enough to get enough of a discount on my badge to be able to buy food.

1438
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:42,660
Scott: Yep.

1439
01:31:42,861 --> 01:31:48,359
Scott: Well, there's always the sub gopher option, which is work at a booth in the dealer's room for a few hours.

1440
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:49,560
Rym: That's a very good option.

1441
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:51,440
Rym: I know a lot of people who do very well doing that.

1442
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:52,852
Scott: Yeah, it's slightly different.

1443
01:31:53,881 --> 01:31:59,259
Scott: I think it's about equal and different to being a gopher because being a gopher is like, "Okay, I can't afford to get into this thing.

1444
01:32:00,262 --> 01:32:00,768
Scott: I'm going to be a

1445
01:32:00,809 --> 01:32:01,133
Scott: gopher.".

1446
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:08,117
Scott: But someone who works in the dealer's room at a convention is like, "All right, I can afford a hotel and my badge, but I'm not going to eat.

1447
01:32:08,178 --> 01:32:08,419
Scott: well.

1448
01:32:09,001 --> 01:32:22,059
Scott: If I spend half of one day at the convention standing at that booth selling stuff, I might get some cool stuff from that booth and I'll get money and I can eat a nice dinner and have a comfortable ride home and pay for parking.

1449
01:32:22,501 --> 01:32:23,328
Scott: So I think that's what I'm going to

1450
01:32:23,348 --> 01:32:23,409
Scott: do.".

1451
01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:27,013
Rym: But anyway, all in all, Otakon 2006 was fantastic.

1452
01:32:28,522 --> 01:32:28,776
Scott: Awesome.

1453
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:31,239
Rym: We met some of our fans, we had a great time.

1454
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:36,920
Rym: I've already looked into getting hotel rooms for Otakon 2007.

1455
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:48,140
Rym: There is a small chance that GeekNights will have a suite or a penthouse somewhere in the inner harbor, wherein there will be some sort of podcast party of magnitude.

1456
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:54,959
Scott: Heck, we might even just rent out our normal room, like one of those ballrooms in one of the hotels, perhaps our hotel.

1457
01:32:55,242 --> 01:32:56,160
Scott: See how much that costs.

1458
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:57,800
Rym: Yeah, we're looking into a lot of options.

1459
01:32:57,960 --> 01:33:01,120
Rym: We've got slightly less than a year to do this, but stay tuned.

1460
01:33:01,921 --> 01:33:06,280
Rym: Because Big Fire, as far as I can tell, is not so big anymore.

1461
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:07,420
Rym: Or at least it's underground.

1462
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:08,940
Rym: I don't see evidence of it anymore.

1463
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:09,340
Rym: Nope.

1464
01:33:11,365 --> 01:33:18,279
Rym: So, it seems like room parties are on the decline, and I don't see so many of them anymore, and I really want to bring that back in a big way.

1465
01:33:18,682 --> 01:33:21,840
Rym: Because we used to throw some fucking awesome room parties.

1466
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:25,300
Scott: I saw one advertisement for a room party in our hotel.

1467
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:28,860
Rym: The moment you see advertisements, that room party is bad.

1468
01:33:29,162 --> 01:33:31,500
Rym: A room party has to be invite only.

1469
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:34,200
Rym: Now, I don't mean invite only like, "You're cool, you're not.

1470
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:34,955
Rym: You're cool, you're

1471
01:33:35,016 --> 01:33:35,139
Rym: not.".

1472
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:39,956
Rym: But you only tell people you would actually want to have at your party to come to your party.

1473
01:33:40,661 --> 01:33:44,400
Rym: And you have people at the door to not let in people who might cause trouble.

1474
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:46,780
Scott: In other words, you carry around three business cards.

1475
01:33:47,021 --> 01:33:49,299
Scott: One is the fake business card that has false information.

1476
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:54,958
Scott: One is the business card so they can contact you and visit your website and send you an email.

1477
01:33:55,201 --> 01:33:58,600
Scott: And the third one is the room and time for the secret party.

1478
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:02,360
Scott: And you hand out the right ones to the right people while you're at the convention.

1479
01:34:03,020 --> 01:34:06,200
Rym: So if you saw us at Otakon 2006-- Hot girlies always get the third one.

1480
01:34:06,561 --> 01:34:06,918
Rym: I'm sure.

1481
01:34:07,662 --> 01:34:08,180
Rym: Cat girls.

1482
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:09,319
Rym: Things like that.

1483
01:34:09,540 --> 01:34:09,627
Rym: Yeah.

1484
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:16,600
Rym: We will see you at Otakon 2007, I guarantee there will be some sort of awesome, and Otakon was fantastic.

1485
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:21,079
Rym: I don't know how many times I need to say that, I just want to stress that Otakon was fantastic.

1486
01:34:21,220 --> 01:34:23,379
Rym: It was far and away the best con of the year.

1487
01:34:23,561 --> 01:34:26,176
Scott: Yeah, there is a chance we won't show up at Otakon 2007 though.

1488
01:34:26,860 --> 01:34:27,660
Rym: If we die.

1489
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:28,457
Rym: Exactly.

1490
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:35,320
Rym: No, if we die, I will stipulate in my will that I will be cremated and my ashes will be fired out of a cannon into the cosplay.

1491
01:34:36,484 --> 01:34:36,859
Scott: Oh god.

1492
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:38,133
Rym: Oh god.

1493
01:34:46,082 --> 01:34:48,160
Rym: And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1494
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:50,819
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

1495
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:55,619
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontrowcrew.com.

01:34:58,862 --> 01:34:59,617

1500
01:35:11,140 --> 01:35:13,700
Rym: GeekNights airs every weeknight Monday through Thursday.

1501
01:35:14,440 --> 01:35:17,640
Scott: GeekNights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

1502
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:21,520
Scott: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
