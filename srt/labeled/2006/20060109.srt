00:00:56,805 --> 00:00:57,910
Scott: I didn't take it from you.

18
00:00:58,655 --> 00:01:00,187
Scott: I wasn't gonna pay you money for it.

19
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,829
Rym: So anyway, I just have one funny little bit today.

20
00:01:04,312 --> 00:01:06,542
Rym: I discovered that I am NOT just Rym.

00:01:07,285 --> 00:01:13,370
Rym: I am the Definite article Rym as in the Rym, you know, I didn't know any other Rym's.

Scott: How do they spell his name our YM and it's a woman really?

25
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:30,594
Rym: Yeah And there's a more and more and finding the word Rym on the internet all over the place in things that aren't related to me Republican youth majority.

26
00:01:30,754 --> 00:01:34,365
Rym: Yeah, or a brand of underwear that ran underwear is awesome.

27
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:35,308
Rym: I'm thinking of buying some.

28
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:36,070
Scott: get some.

29
00:01:36,792 --> 00:01:42,810
Rym: These designer like men's sexy briefs in other words ghetto bvds.

30
00:01:43,412 --> 00:01:48,290
Rym: Actually my initials cuz my real name is Brandon, but well not my real name kind of my given name.

31
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:48,924
Rym: I don't really use it.

32
00:01:49,474 --> 00:01:50,425
Rym: It's kind of a long story.

33
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:59,825
Rym: But uh, my dad when I was born wanted to make my middle name Vincent just so that my initials would be BVD And my mom put the kibosh on that.

34
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:11,604
Rym: right quick right Lisa but someone mentioned my name apparently at RIT where I used to go and run the anime club and everything and Someone in the room turns and says wait a minute.

35
00:02:11,704 --> 00:02:12,590
Rym: You mean the Rym?

36
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,366
Scott: Yeah, this is a second hand third hand story.

37
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,294
Scott: No, no Resource.

38
00:02:18,516 --> 00:02:20,530
Scott: Yeah, but you're still be King exaggerator.

39
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,709
Rym: So hey, hey, do I have to get the primary source on the show to tell you what's up?

40
00:02:25,151 --> 00:02:26,215
Scott: I'll still.

41
00:02:26,435 --> 00:02:28,181
Scott: I'll go and find out what really happened.

42
00:02:28,462 --> 00:02:29,666
Rym: Yeah, I find it.

43
00:02:29,807 --> 00:02:30,750
Rym: Absolutely hilarious.

44
00:02:31,353 --> 00:02:32,518
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty funny.

45
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:37,143
Scott: I'm sure it was something I'm not saying it was totally You know not happening.

46
00:02:37,183 --> 00:02:40,733
Scott: I'm just saying you are exaggerating the Something.

47
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:45,989
Rym: someone said blah blah blah Rym and some and then someone else said the Rym.

48
00:02:50,196 --> 00:03:00,207
Rym: But in less funny news Bush signed in a law today a bill that I had not heard of or been in any way aware of Until slash dot and fart told me about it.

49
00:03:01,132 --> 00:03:06,454
Scott: Yeah, I don't think anyone knew about it because you know what 99% of laws No one knows anything about.

50
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:15,449
Rym: but I mean usually when you hear about a like a bad law like the DMCA or something horrible Or that the CDB CBD PA that's these people are watching out for that stuff.

51
00:03:15,811 --> 00:03:23,819
Rym: yeah, but it's always like this menacing thing far off on the horizon that either won't likely get passed or we're gonna worry about it years to come.

52
00:03:24,481 --> 00:03:31,983
Rym: this one didn't appear until it was passed and It's the violence against women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act.

53
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:43,382
Scott: That's why no one knew about it because the only people looking at it were the people who are like the feminists and they want to be against violence against women and They pushed it through actually.

54
00:03:43,442 --> 00:03:44,147
Rym: No, that's not at all.

55
00:03:44,187 --> 00:03:44,610
Rym: What happened?

56
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:45,251
Scott: No, this

57
00:03:45,331 --> 00:03:55,220
Rym: was a law that was just kind of cobbled together from a whole bunch of various anti harassment anti Discrimination things all bundled together

58
00:03:55,521 --> 00:03:57,210
Scott: see me as an anti First Amendment law

59
00:03:57,431 --> 00:04:00,868
Rym: No, and then tacked on to another spending law that was gonna get passed no matter what?

60
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,260
Rym: Great had nothing to do with feminists.

61
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,429
Rym: I don't know why I even brought them up.

62
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,177
Scott: Okay Then why did it say violence against women?

63
00:04:06,218 --> 00:04:06,579
Scott: something?

64
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:08,690
Rym: because that was just one of the names on the law.

65
00:04:08,972 --> 00:04:20,329
Rym: Because part of the law is to protect women who divorce or actually Women and men it just uses women the title of the law who divorce an abusive spouse and want to not be harassed by them.

66
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:34,668
Rym: Mm-hmm, but basically the law and I'm not exaggerating at all here makes it illegal to in any way annoy someone on The internet or in any way with any piece of technology without providing your full legal name.

67
00:04:34,688 --> 00:04:35,390
Scott: So wait.

68
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:42,565
Rym: So yeah, if you're a troll on slashdot and you don't say who you are jail two years.

69
00:04:43,086 --> 00:04:47,490
Scott: so who determines When someone's annoying and when someone's not?

70
00:04:48,334 --> 00:04:48,676
Rym: What do you mean?

71
00:04:48,697 --> 00:04:49,742
Rym: it's just like any other law.

72
00:04:49,763 --> 00:04:51,030
Rym: it's like any harassment case.

73
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:55,067
Scott: So I can just say that guy's annoying me and go after him.

74
00:04:55,388 --> 00:05:00,222
Scott: Yeah Sweet next time someone is all like pros something.

75
00:05:00,242 --> 00:05:00,784
Scott: I'm against.

76
00:05:00,804 --> 00:05:02,330
Scott: I'm gonna go after him and say they're annoying.

77
00:05:02,872 --> 00:05:06,283
Rym: Okay way to just exploit a stupid law to cause a bad situation.

78
00:05:06,303 --> 00:05:08,190
Scott: That's the easiest way to make it go away.

79
00:05:08,992 --> 00:05:10,196
Rym: Probably not see.

80
00:05:10,397 --> 00:05:14,410
Rym: I worry if the courts are even gonna look at this case because it supposedly protects people.

81
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:19,688
Scott: Yeah, but as soon as someone sees it being abused they're gonna get rid of it.

82
00:05:19,768 --> 00:05:20,250
Scott: or a job.

83
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,180
Rym: MCA has been abused countless times and it's still there.

84
00:05:24,561 --> 00:05:27,370
Rym: the Patriot Act has been abused countless times and it's still there.

85
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,736
Scott: Well, then, you know what worst case.

86
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:29,862
Scott: a bunch of people.

87
00:05:29,942 --> 00:05:38,689
Scott: I don't like will go to jail Great, and you know what that'll immediately turn them into people I do like as they'll be on my side trying to get rid of the stupid law.

88
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:45,465
Scott: So Myspace the bastion of crappy websites for crappy little kids god.

89
00:05:45,505 --> 00:05:46,949
Rym: I hate my space so much.

90
00:05:47,491 --> 00:05:50,040
Scott: Anyway, it was bought by evil Fox recently.

91
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,187
Rym: Yeah, but Murdoch's News Corp and all that.

92
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:52,789
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

93
00:05:52,809 --> 00:05:56,459
Scott: and They finally started doing evil.

94
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:04,097
Scott: They blocked links on my space to places like YouTube and Anything that competed with them?

95
00:06:04,117 --> 00:06:05,985
Scott: Yeah, anything that Fox didn't like.

96
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:09,108
Scott: they basically Myspace blocked it.

97
00:06:09,571 --> 00:06:15,968
Rym: They either deleted the links or they change the text of the links or they deleted entries or filtered them out or you know whatever.

98
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:23,450
Scott: so Every all little kiddies on myspace said what the hell we're just gonna stop using my space and go use something else.

99
00:06:24,292 --> 00:06:26,438
Scott: And then they caved and they undid it.

100
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:27,621
Rym: Yeah for now.

101
00:06:28,142 --> 00:06:28,523
Rym: Luckily.

102
00:06:28,543 --> 00:06:31,009
Rym: I think those people realize that they have to get off of myspace.

103
00:06:32,317 --> 00:06:32,645
Scott: Think so

104
00:06:33,572 --> 00:06:46,270
Rym: But at least it made me happy that even in the cesspool that is myspace Which is only about one step up above 4chan in terms of crap Actually had enough smart people to realize that something bad was going on and did everything they could to mitigate that.

105
00:06:46,952 --> 00:06:53,350
Scott: I think any group on the internet period that if you try to you know Do something that harms a group on the internet?

106
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:59,289
Scott: They'll just come at you, you know, because it's so easy to go after someone on the internet All you do is type a few words and you push buttons.

107
00:06:59,912 --> 00:07:05,330
Rym: Yeah, it's easy to ignore anyone who does that to you on the internet but not it's not easy to ignore a thousand people.

108
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,430
Scott: who?

109
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:06,414
Scott: Do that on the internet?

110
00:07:06,494 --> 00:07:07,037
Rym: Yeah, it is.

111
00:07:07,057 --> 00:07:09,187
Rym: You just don't read your email anymore.

112
00:07:09,207 --> 00:07:09,930
Rym: You get a new account.

113
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:18,410
Scott: Yeah And then but if you're like in charge of something or you have power on the internet You'll soon lose all that power when all the people you have power over stop using your software?

114
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:19,733
Rym: That depends.

115
00:07:19,793 --> 00:07:24,589
Rym: I mean AOL has done a lot of terrible things with aim over the years and most people still use aim.

116
00:07:25,393 --> 00:07:27,160
Scott: We jump ship right just the right time.

117
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:29,650
Rym: actually we both still use aim so we didn't really jump ship.

118
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,743
Scott: I use aim through a transport so it doesn't.

119
00:07:31,843 --> 00:07:32,890
Rym: so you're still using aim.

120
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:35,460
Rym: You do you realize that most of your friends use aim?

121
00:07:35,802 --> 00:07:37,710
Rym: a grand total of about ten of us use jabber?

122
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:43,857
Scott: Yeah, but if you look at the messages I said most of the messages I said are to me Specifically to me and me alone.

123
00:07:44,258 --> 00:07:46,567
Scott: Yeah, cuz I don't really use aim that much or any.

124
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:47,309
Scott: I am that much.

125
00:07:47,671 --> 00:07:50,910
Rym: Yeah, see I am is really my primary means of communication these days.

126
00:07:52,492 --> 00:07:53,215
Scott: I don't know.

127
00:07:53,235 --> 00:07:55,082
Scott: I don't really communicate that much.

128
00:07:55,464 --> 00:07:56,548
Rym: Well, you don't communicate with people.

129
00:07:56,588 --> 00:07:57,130
Rym: That's your problem.

130
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:57,956
Rym: You're always out of the loop.

131
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,850
Scott: Yeah, well, I don't need to be in the loop.

132
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:03,543
Scott: I communicate when I got something to say when I want to know something specific.

133
00:08:04,787 --> 00:08:05,570
Rym: I just talked to people.

134
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:06,916
Scott: I don't talk for the sake of talking.

135
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,544
Scott: That's a waste of time.

136
00:08:08,584 --> 00:08:21,980
Rym: I got something to do Podcasting So those of you who know us may know that we're big fans of mr.

137
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,221
Rym: T.

138
00:08:22,943 --> 00:08:23,204
Scott: Mr.

139
00:08:23,244 --> 00:08:26,592
Scott: T. He don't be nobody's fool and Mr.

140
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:30,803
Rym: T for many of you who might not know had a cartoon show on.

141
00:08:30,963 --> 00:08:32,347
Rym: I think it was the early 90s.

142
00:08:32,727 --> 00:08:33,208
Scott: never saw it.

143
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:50,982
Rym: it's pretty terrible and In addition to that, I don't know what this is from and I didn't bother looking on the internet to find out but mr T did a music video about uh Mothers, no way Was he singing or was it like his band?

144
00:08:51,182 --> 00:08:53,430
Scott: or as far as I know he's not a musician.

145
00:08:54,092 --> 00:09:02,616
Rym: See it's weird because he's not singing so much as he's talking at you and there's music in the background Uh-huh, and there's backup singers.

146
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:03,678
Rym: They're singing and dancing.

147
00:09:03,738 --> 00:09:03,979
Rym: Mr.

148
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:09,952
Rym: T's just standing there pointing his finger at you and talking kind of like Captain Kirk Mm-hmm.

149
00:09:10,594 --> 00:09:14,448
Rym: Well actually kind of like William Shatner who wasn't playing Kirk when he did that album or how about?

150
00:09:14,508 --> 00:09:19,230
Scott: kind of like mr T who does that, you know looks at you in points and talks at you.

151
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:25,835
Rym: All I got to say is when you watch my thing of the day after about 30 seconds of it That's all you're gonna get out of it.

152
00:09:25,915 --> 00:09:26,838
Rym: Don't watch the whole thing.

153
00:09:26,878 --> 00:09:27,420
Rym: You'll die.

154
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,587
Scott: I pity the fool who watch the whole thing.

155
00:09:29,607 --> 00:09:32,032
Scott: Yeah All right.

156
00:09:32,594 --> 00:09:37,289
Scott: So remember the other day we talked about a square one math man math, man.

157
00:09:38,072 --> 00:09:43,689
Scott: I found a nice little website with a bunch of videos from square one one of which is a math, man.

158
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:45,393
Rym: it's terrible.

159
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:53,918
Scott: he has to eat every number less than 0.5 and It's just like the olden days when I was a little kid where I'd say yeah eat that one you eat that one.

160
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:55,765
Scott: Yes Yeah, eat that one.

161
00:09:55,945 --> 00:09:56,266
Scott: Eat that one.

162
00:09:56,287 --> 00:09:56,547
Scott: Yes.

163
00:09:57,531 --> 00:09:59,678
Scott: Oh my god, you idiot if you eat that one.

164
00:09:59,718 --> 00:10:01,195
Scott: I swear to god I'm turning off the TV.

165
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,043
Scott: God damn it.

166
00:10:03,284 --> 00:10:04,970
Scott: God damn it stupid frickin math, man.

167
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:05,994
Scott: I could beat this game.

168
00:10:06,034 --> 00:10:06,756
Scott: Give me the joystick.

169
00:10:06,776 --> 00:10:11,230
Scott: Yeah Only uh, it looks a lot worse than I remember it.

170
00:10:11,531 --> 00:10:16,714
Rym: It's very obvious that while they're emulating a computer game They did not use a computer to do so.

171
00:10:16,735 --> 00:10:24,280
Scott: Yeah I mean sure the bad encoding of the internet video counts for something, but really it's worse than I remember.

172
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:25,799
Scott: It's bad.

173
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:27,996
Scott: We should make new math, man.

174
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:39,590
Rym: So, uh today since it's Monday, which is generally SciTech computer Linux, what's-it-day We're gonna talk about how to maintain your computer.

175
00:10:40,232 --> 00:10:42,760
Scott: A lot of people don't even know they need to maintain their computer.

176
00:10:43,463 --> 00:10:47,116
Rym: I mean most people like they build the computer and there's all this sweat and blood.

177
00:10:47,136 --> 00:10:48,060
Scott: Or they just buy a Dell.

178
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:51,525
Rym: Well, I'm talking to you know people are at least a little geeky.

179
00:10:51,545 --> 00:11:04,899
Rym: You build a computer and you put a lot of effort into building it and Then it's done and you turn it on and you you know You either install Windows and reboot it 5,000 times or you install Linux and you just do a thousand things to it

180
00:11:05,481 --> 00:11:05,602
Scott: Mm-hmm,

181
00:11:06,104 --> 00:11:10,804
Rym: and then it's done and you leave it and every now and then you install an application Mm-hmm, you can't do that.

182
00:11:11,245 --> 00:11:16,260
Rym: No, I mean it sounds weird and we're not saying that there's bit rot or anything stupid like that.

183
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,227
Rym: But computers need maintenance just like cars.

184
00:11:18,729 --> 00:11:21,800
Scott: Yeah, a lot of people are like, ah, the computer shouldn't need any maintenance.

185
00:11:22,001 --> 00:11:23,129
Scott: I want it to have no maintenance.

186
00:11:23,169 --> 00:11:23,894
Scott: if it needs maintenance.

187
00:11:23,954 --> 00:11:24,357
Scott: It sucks.

188
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:29,620
Scott: Well Everything in the world needs maintenance even like a toaster oven you got to clean the crumbs out.

189
00:11:30,002 --> 00:11:30,525
Rym: No, you don't.

190
00:11:30,645 --> 00:11:32,154
Rym: toaster ovens are three dollars.

191
00:11:32,214 --> 00:11:33,139
Rym: You just buy a new one.

192
00:11:33,561 --> 00:11:38,204
Scott: Well, yeah, but I'm just you know, I'm saying like even a VCR, you know You can clean it.

193
00:11:38,486 --> 00:11:43,247
Rym: you realize most people don't know you can clean a VCR and they just used to buy new ones or they Take it to a VCR repairman.

194
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:48,960
Scott: and those are the same people who don't know that when you get spyware You can format your hard drive and reinstall the OS and they just buy a new computer.

195
00:11:49,312 --> 00:11:54,195
Rym: Yeah So you've ever laughed at someone for buying a new something when they could have just fixed it?

196
00:11:54,776 --> 00:11:55,940
Rym: and you don't maintain your computer?

197
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:56,903
Rym: Well, we're laughing at you.

198
00:11:57,204 --> 00:11:57,405
Scott: Yep.

199
00:11:58,087 --> 00:12:02,000
Rym: Now if you have a Mac a lot of this doesn't apply because Macs actually really make it easy.

200
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:08,299
Scott: Yeah, you just it won't mess up for a very long time and there's not much you can do to mess it up.

201
00:12:08,883 --> 00:12:09,528
Scott: I mean and you can.

202
00:12:09,548 --> 00:12:11,200
Scott: there aren't even screws on those things.

203
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,004
Scott: You can't open them.

204
00:12:12,084 --> 00:12:14,977
Rym: so and you don't need to but PC's you need to.

205
00:12:15,219 --> 00:12:17,793
Scott: yeah Well, you still need to maintain a Mac.

206
00:12:17,853 --> 00:12:21,848
Scott: is eventually, you know You might mess it up and you don't you don't really want to.

207
00:12:22,952 --> 00:12:25,539
Scott: a lot of the things apply across the board no matter what?

208
00:12:26,261 --> 00:12:32,237
Scott: Operating system or kind of computer you have but a Mac you really can't you know get to the point.

209
00:12:32,598 --> 00:12:35,189
Scott: or with Linux You can't get to the point where your computer is.

210
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:37,820
Scott: just think of it like in your car.

211
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,820
Scott: If you don't change the oil the engine will seize, you know, that's the end of the car.

212
00:12:42,821 --> 00:12:49,080
Scott: But with Windows you can get the engine to seize but not with Linux or Mac or anything unless you go out of your way.

213
00:12:49,501 --> 00:12:55,520
Rym: I mean if you're using Gentoo and you change your global keyword to star and then emerge update new use deep world?

214
00:12:56,301 --> 00:12:58,851
Scott: Well, yeah, but that's just that's not.

215
00:12:58,891 --> 00:13:01,140
Scott: that's not forgetting to change the oil and having the engine.

216
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,584
Scott: You know what?

217
00:13:01,605 --> 00:13:04,383
Rym: That is that's replacing the oil with Explosive.

218
00:13:04,503 --> 00:13:07,400
Scott: No, that's driving a hundred miles an hour and then switching into reverse.

219
00:13:09,682 --> 00:13:15,303
Rym: All right, I guess we'll break this up into two broad categories physical and Non-physical.

220
00:13:15,444 --> 00:13:16,308
Scott: the physical is easy.

221
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,574
Rym: Yeah, it's not.

222
00:13:17,594 --> 00:13:18,600
Rym: it's easy in some ways.

223
00:13:19,062 --> 00:13:20,628
Rym: The hard part is actually doing it.

224
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:26,931
Rym: Yeah, I'm going to do it and knowing that you have to do it Well number one if your computer gets dusty clean it out.

225
00:13:27,532 --> 00:13:29,960
Rym: now you might think oh it doesn't get dusty in there.

226
00:13:30,201 --> 00:13:32,796
Rym: I mean look my desk isn't that dusty?

227
00:13:33,037 --> 00:13:33,399
Scott: open it up.

228
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:45,313
Rym: Yeah If you haven't opened your computer before in fact If you've never opened your computer Right after you listen to this open your tape turn your computer off unplug it and just open it and look inside Unless you're allergic to dust or something weird like that.

229
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:46,780
Scott: You want me to do it outside?

230
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,206
Rym: Yeah, we're gonna be real non-technical here.

231
00:13:49,588 --> 00:14:01,477
Rym: So, uh, you know if you have a TV or stereo and For some reason there's always more dust on the TV than there is on anything else in the house There's always more dust on the electronic things than the non-electronic thing.

232
00:14:01,558 --> 00:14:02,040
Scott: That's true.

233
00:14:02,422 --> 00:14:05,999
Rym: There are a lot of reasons for that but electronic things collect dust.

234
00:14:07,163 --> 00:14:09,659
Rym: Your computer is the most electronic thing you own.

235
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:16,818
Rym: well, unless you own a Various cool Tesla things which we won't talk about.

236
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,182
Scott: little Jacob's ladder.

237
00:14:18,382 --> 00:14:19,807
Rym: Yeah, or a little a spark transmitter.

238
00:14:20,689 --> 00:14:20,749
Scott: Mmm.

239
00:14:22,673 --> 00:14:24,018
Rym: But I mean the inside of your computer.

240
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,830
Rym: you have the fans on right and they're drawing air through your computer.

241
00:14:27,732 --> 00:14:29,948
Rym: They're drawing dust in and the dust isn't coming back out.

242
00:14:30,952 --> 00:14:33,922
Scott: Well, you know the the dust might come back out but not much.

243
00:14:34,484 --> 00:14:39,710
Scott: and if you have a filter on your intake fan Like I do sure there won't be that much dust in your computer.

244
00:14:40,011 --> 00:14:46,574
Scott: But you still have to clean that filter off or else eventually it'll just start sucking the dust right through it Or even worse.

245
00:14:46,695 --> 00:14:49,587
Rym: It'll just block the intake and then your computer overheat and crash.

246
00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:50,732
Scott: Yeah That's even.

247
00:14:50,752 --> 00:14:53,883
Rym: that's a real bad - so I mean I've seen people like.

248
00:14:53,923 --> 00:15:02,848
Rym: I've seen a lot of people who had they bought like an Alienware computer or something and it has a little kind of filter e on it and they thought oh I never have to clean my computer because I got a little filter.

249
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:06,830
Rym: and Then their computer doesn't work anymore and I look at it and you know what?

250
00:15:07,591 --> 00:15:09,117
Rym: You don't have an intake fan anymore.

251
00:15:09,157 --> 00:15:24,083
Scott: You just have a giant opaque solid mass of dust Yep, and it's real hard depending on like what it to get a replacement for that filter, you know They don't make you know Filters for intake fans that you can just buy in the shape.

252
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:29,250
Scott: that for your case specifically Especially since cases change every week, you know.

253
00:15:29,572 --> 00:15:37,538
Rym: So the first thing you want to do is if you've never done it before Open your computer and take a can of compressed air and when I say compressed air I mean the compressed air.

254
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,670
Rym: you buy it like staples.

255
00:15:39,031 --> 00:15:40,456
Scott: yeah, I'll just be in there.

256
00:15:40,777 --> 00:15:48,612
Scott: there should be a section in staples that has little cans of air and like LCD monitor wipes and all sorts of computer cleaning equipment's

257
00:15:48,913 --> 00:16:01,723
Rym: use the ones you find at a computer store or an office store because they won't sell the other kinds you go to a hardware store you'll have more choices as to what kind of compressed air you want and Some kinds can break your computer or cause static or get chemicals.

258
00:16:01,944 --> 00:16:02,426
Rym: all these problems.

259
00:16:02,446 --> 00:16:05,673
Scott: Some of those are meant for Not cleaning.

260
00:16:05,713 --> 00:16:10,385
Scott: they're meant for like, you know filling tires or crazy stuff like that.

261
00:16:10,525 --> 00:16:11,247
Rym: Don't use those.

262
00:16:11,287 --> 00:16:11,949
Scott: You don't want that.

263
00:16:12,732 --> 00:16:19,141
Rym: Basically just take the can always hold it upright because if you tip it over Noxious things are gonna come out of it like liquid nitrogen.

264
00:16:19,684 --> 00:16:20,809
Scott: Oh things that will freeze you.

265
00:16:21,017 --> 00:16:22,435
Scott: Yeah and freeze your computer with.

266
00:16:22,877 --> 00:16:28,220
Rym: and basically just first do this outside to and Spray down the entire inside of the computer.

267
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,304
Rym: You'll see caked up dust.

268
00:16:29,344 --> 00:16:35,090
Rym: Just spray it all out Mmm, and then take the little little bit of a straw a bit that you can stick into the end of the can.

269
00:16:35,891 --> 00:16:43,369
Rym: Feel free as long as the computers unplug to poke that into various bits like the power supply The fan around the CPU and just get all the gunk out.

270
00:16:43,872 --> 00:16:51,324
Scott: One of my favorite things to do is point it straight at a fan and pull the trigger and you can make the fans spin Real fast and all the dust comes flying out.

271
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,229
Scott: That's great.

272
00:16:53,532 --> 00:17:09,351
Rym: Now after you've done that and the computers clean you really have two options Either do that every month or so more often if you smoke more often still if you have pets More often still if your computer is in the basement on the floor Or if you live in like Mexico City Or

273
00:17:09,371 --> 00:17:13,125
Scott: like my parents who keeps the freaking computer like on the floor in the kitchen.

274
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:14,390
Scott: that thing was so freakin dusty.

275
00:17:14,531 --> 00:17:15,922
Scott: Oh my god, man.

276
00:17:15,962 --> 00:17:27,771
Rym: at IBM where I work We have the sintering area which basically are giant furnaces shooting flame into the air Constantly awesome and the air is real sooty Great.

277
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,560
Rym: I maintain like 30 computers in there.

278
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:33,410
Scott: Well, you just put them in plastic bags or something.

279
00:17:33,611 --> 00:17:34,534
Rym: Yeah, that'll work.

280
00:17:34,635 --> 00:17:38,449
Scott: or just like pipe out the the heat from the computers to somewhere else.

281
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:40,749
Rym: Yeah, and where are they gonna get their intake air from?

282
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,356
Rym: Another pipe, you know what?

283
00:17:43,536 --> 00:17:47,410
Rym: No, I just replaced the computers and they stopped working because they're so cheap and I have so many.

284
00:17:47,716 --> 00:17:48,147
Scott: That's good.

285
00:17:49,171 --> 00:17:53,569
Scott: But anyway, that's really all you have to do to make sure your hardware of your computer stays.

286
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:55,988
Scott: Good is make sure dust doesn't get all over it.

287
00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:03,109
Rym: But I mean you can either do this every month or you can put a filter on it And then you maybe have to clean the filter every month, which is usually easier.

288
00:18:03,571 --> 00:18:04,720
Scott: Yeah, I should go clean my filter.

289
00:18:04,741 --> 00:18:05,285
Scott: I keep forgetting.

290
00:18:05,749 --> 00:18:09,102
Rym: now I would recommend against buying any sort of filter you see in a store.

291
00:18:09,483 --> 00:18:10,266
Rym: They're overpriced.

292
00:18:10,928 --> 00:18:12,929
Rym: They don't fit Well, they're generally pain in the ass.

293
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:19,250
Rym: now what I do and Scott kind of says this is a but whatever I use pantyhose for a lot of things.

294
00:18:19,836 --> 00:18:25,169
Rym: I use pantyhose for this pop filter I'm talking through right now and buy a pair of pantyhose and make a filter out of that.

295
00:18:25,511 --> 00:18:27,176
Scott: Oh, see my case came with a filter.

296
00:18:27,939 --> 00:18:28,882
Rym: Yeah, most cases don't?

297
00:18:29,765 --> 00:18:30,207
Scott: I don't know.

298
00:18:30,227 --> 00:18:32,033
Scott: a lot of cases now They have little filters.

299
00:18:32,073 --> 00:18:33,499
Rym: Oh, yeah a lot too, but most don't.

300
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,210
Scott: well if you're buying a case get one with a little intake filter.

301
00:18:37,171 --> 00:18:45,310
Rym: I'd recommend not caring about that because it's much cheaper to just buy a pair of pantyhose Because the case that has an intake filter cost so much more than one without.

302
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:47,337
Rym: Well a lot of a lot of side.

303
00:18:47,357 --> 00:18:49,630
Rym: They just don't say if it has an intake filter like on Newegg.

304
00:18:49,751 --> 00:18:53,977
Scott: They just say fans whatever you can see you can look at the picture of the case and you're like, oh look There's a filter there.

305
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:54,806
Rym: You can't always see.

306
00:18:57,251 --> 00:19:00,969
Rym: The presence of an intake filter should not in any way influence for how you buy a case.

307
00:19:01,592 --> 00:19:03,201
Scott: I don't influence how I buy a case.

308
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:03,765
Rym: You're silly.

309
00:19:03,785 --> 00:19:04,710
Scott: No, you're silly.

310
00:19:04,931 --> 00:19:10,610
Rym: Your case has a glass panel in the side and you have a frickin cold cathode tube that flashes blue light.

311
00:19:11,092 --> 00:19:11,513
Scott: It's awesome.

312
00:19:11,533 --> 00:19:14,503
Scott: You have a riced out computer and it's better than your computer.

313
00:19:15,045 --> 00:19:16,470
Rym: Rice is not cool on a computer.

314
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,153
Rym: I think it's silly.

315
00:19:17,455 --> 00:19:20,269
Scott: Well, you think it's silly but I think it looks better than your computer.

316
00:19:21,271 --> 00:19:22,015
Rym: Okay, Scott.

317
00:19:22,176 --> 00:19:24,328
Rym: How come it looks good on your computer, but is dumb on your car?

318
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,938
Scott: Yeah, because uh, yeah.

319
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:27,702
Rym: Yeah.

320
00:19:27,823 --> 00:19:34,990
Scott: Yeah well Because a computer just like sits there and does nothing, right?

321
00:19:36,151 --> 00:19:42,122
Scott: It's not really You know, they're traditionally like blah and it's not something people look at.

322
00:19:42,743 --> 00:19:54,288
Scott: so turning it into something people look at is like, ah but a car is traditionally something people look at and You know putting lights on it doesn't make it look good.

323
00:19:55,813 --> 00:19:58,109
Rym: How does putting lights on the computer make it look good then?

324
00:19:59,772 --> 00:20:01,289
Scott: Because we're not really much else you can do.

325
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:05,462
Rym: Um, that was probably the worst argument you've ever made.

326
00:20:05,482 --> 00:20:07,310
Rym: It was real bad.

327
00:20:07,872 --> 00:20:09,438
Scott: What else can you do to make a computer look good?

328
00:20:09,478 --> 00:20:10,241
Scott: It's a box.

329
00:20:11,065 --> 00:20:12,249
Scott: I mean you put a light on it.

330
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:13,673
Rym: Give it up.

331
00:20:13,814 --> 00:20:14,396
Rym: Just give it up.

332
00:20:14,557 --> 00:20:15,381
Scott: It's like a Christmas tree.

333
00:20:15,401 --> 00:20:16,486
Scott: What can you do to make it look good?

334
00:20:16,566 --> 00:20:19,469
Rym: put a light on it Yeah, so why not put a light on the car?

335
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:21,794
Rym: Why is the car different?

336
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:22,979
Scott: Well, here's the thing.

337
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,228
Scott: if your car is real crummy a light can help it.

338
00:20:25,428 --> 00:20:27,639
Rym: But if Wait a minute.

339
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:30,414
Rym: No, no in fact I submit the opposite.

340
00:20:30,454 --> 00:20:33,486
Rym: the better your car is the more likely a light would look good there.

341
00:20:33,787 --> 00:20:46,088
Rym: if you have like a 91 broken tempo putting a blue light on the bottom is not going to make it look better, you know LEDs make everything better including cars Only if they're yeah.

342
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:48,995
Rym: Don't try to argue when you're sick.

343
00:20:49,316 --> 00:20:50,882
Rym: Yeah, that's my advice to you Scott.

344
00:20:50,942 --> 00:20:51,363
Scott: Whatever.

345
00:20:51,644 --> 00:20:53,370
Scott: How do we maintain a damn computer?

346
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:57,950
Rym: So anyway, just take some pantyhose and stick them on your intake fans and leave some slack.

347
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,309
Rym: So they'll catch all the dust and then periodically replace them.

348
00:21:00,618 --> 00:21:02,715
Rym: Yeah That's that's the cheapest way to put a filter.

349
00:21:03,156 --> 00:21:11,007
Rym: or like James Coon said in our forums set up your fake your case with positive Pressure meaning have more intake fans than you do.

350
00:21:11,047 --> 00:21:11,590
Rym: exhaust fans.

351
00:21:13,852 --> 00:21:16,469
Rym: That'll keep air from coming in anywhere other than the intakes.

352
00:21:16,911 --> 00:21:17,112
Scott: Mm-hmm.

353
00:21:17,794 --> 00:21:20,603
Rym: I go with negative pressure because it cools slightly better.

354
00:21:20,643 --> 00:21:24,507
Rym: You just have to clean the inside of the case a lot more often Mm-hmm, so it's kind of a trade-off.

355
00:21:26,337 --> 00:21:31,638
Rym: And you know just there's little things like keep your computer Generally, like don't spell things on it.

356
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:32,842
Rym: Don't knock it over.

357
00:21:32,862 --> 00:21:34,710
Rym: Oh, yeah keyboards.

358
00:21:35,232 --> 00:21:39,110
Scott: Just you can clean keyboards and you should because the dirtiest part of the computer.

359
00:21:39,772 --> 00:21:44,110
Scott: But really you should buy a new one like every year too because they just get mad nasty.

360
00:21:44,411 --> 00:21:50,130
Rym: I use the same keyboard from sixth grade until my junior year and I was freaking mad nasty.

361
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:55,970
Rym: Oh my god, it had like marker and stickers and key binds from games.

362
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,839
Rym: I played back but like doom two days.

363
00:21:57,859 --> 00:21:59,346
Scott: It was a scary kid.

364
00:21:59,466 --> 00:22:01,880
Scott: Yeah a freaking thing Yeah, and it finally died.

365
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,349
Rym: and then I bought the keyboard I'm using now.

366
00:22:04,172 --> 00:22:05,556
Scott: Thank God I've used four.

367
00:22:05,636 --> 00:22:10,270
Rym: I've used three keyboards in my entire life on my computers mice these days.

368
00:22:10,351 --> 00:22:11,810
Scott: They used to get dirty with the balls.

369
00:22:11,951 --> 00:22:18,657
Scott: But unless you have a ball mouse, which no one has anymore if one has an optical mouse a little light in the bottom You don't need to clean those so much.

370
00:22:18,677 --> 00:22:21,170
Rym: yeah, unless your optical mouse stops working you don't need to buy a new one.

371
00:22:21,371 --> 00:22:25,650
Rym: Yeah, though one thing I got to say I see a lot of people who they have an optical mouse.

372
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:28,709
Rym: So they think oh, I don't need a mouse pad and they just use the mouse on the desk.

373
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,649
Scott: You don't really need a mouse pen.

374
00:22:31,092 --> 00:22:33,849
Rym: There's a good reason why you should have a mouse pad even a little one.

375
00:22:34,331 --> 00:22:38,408
Rym: Because if you just use the mouse on the desk look at look at you take flip your mouse over.

376
00:22:38,448 --> 00:22:45,670
Rym: right now There's probably three or four little ceramic or silicone noblis and they make the mouse flow nicely.

377
00:22:45,751 --> 00:22:46,688
Rym: They're low friction surfaces.

378
00:22:47,711 --> 00:22:51,570
Rym: They get worn down real quick on a lot of old a lot of wooden type desks.

379
00:22:52,134 --> 00:22:58,710
Scott: Well if it depends if your desk is all chafee It'll get worn down like my desk is a shitty piece of wood that I just bought and sanded.

380
00:22:58,851 --> 00:23:00,349
Scott: So you know I need a little pad.

381
00:23:00,792 --> 00:23:08,384
Scott: But if you have like a normal a nice desk with a nice shiny wood that you know is all fan No, even then it wears down the little noblis a lot faster if you have a mouse pad.

382
00:23:09,147 --> 00:23:09,910
Scott: I don't know about that.

383
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,616
Scott: You know is it work at work?

384
00:23:11,817 --> 00:23:15,110
Scott: absolutely no one has a mouse pad and no one's noblis are worn down.

385
00:23:15,732 --> 00:23:18,701
Rym: See at my work everyone who doesn't have a mouse pad their noblis are gone.

386
00:23:18,722 --> 00:23:21,290
Rym: mice are just these scrapey horrible things.

387
00:23:21,872 --> 00:23:26,325
Scott: Yeah, there are no mouse pads in my work pretty much at all and everyone's just fine of course.

388
00:23:26,807 --> 00:23:36,022
Scott: at the same time actually I saw on the internet just yesterday you can buy little low-friction mouse Stickery bits so if yours wear down you can just replace them for like a buck or two.

389
00:23:36,504 --> 00:23:43,426
Scott: Oh, yeah, actually they were actually Advertising them as like special gamer ones so they would be even better now.

390
00:23:43,466 --> 00:23:44,430
Rym: That's just a little silly.

391
00:23:44,971 --> 00:23:45,633
Scott: Well, you know that.

392
00:23:45,653 --> 00:23:46,115
Scott: what do you want?

393
00:23:46,496 --> 00:23:46,877
Rym: see that?

394
00:23:47,158 --> 00:23:47,560
Rym: That's just.

395
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,710
Rym: I mean, there's a level that's basically audio fileness for gamers.

396
00:23:51,131 --> 00:23:58,709
Rym: Yeah, this is a mouse pad though the other benefit of a mouse pad that you really don't want to overlook Is that it is a little bit of padding which is good for your wrists?

397
00:24:00,091 --> 00:24:04,909
Rym: Thing is you really don't want the mouse pad that has that giant knob on the end and you rest your wrist on that.

398
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,853
Scott: They're ergonomic.

399
00:24:07,134 --> 00:24:11,470
Scott: studying people who are just gonna argue about that forever and ever get whatever feels good.

400
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,769
Scott: If you feel comfortable you are comfortable, that's what it comes down to.

401
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:20,901
Rym: yeah My only point is that if you're not using a mouse pad just because you have an optical mouse Looking to get in a mouse pad.

402
00:24:20,922 --> 00:24:21,649
Rym: There are a couple bucks.

403
00:24:22,699 --> 00:24:24,214
Scott: Hey It's all right.

404
00:24:24,555 --> 00:24:25,923
Scott: It's not 100% necessary.

405
00:24:25,943 --> 00:24:27,190
Scott: you get better things to worry about.

406
00:24:27,951 --> 00:24:28,715
Rym: It's a couple bucks.

407
00:24:28,756 --> 00:24:31,309
Rym: I think it's not something you really have to worry about worrying about.

408
00:24:32,115 --> 00:24:32,760
Scott: You know whatever.

409
00:24:32,781 --> 00:24:37,318
Scott: so The non hardware bits ice.

410
00:24:37,338 --> 00:24:38,642
Rym: you can skip monitors and all that.

411
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,791
Scott: Oh clean your monitor if it gets dusty All right.

412
00:24:41,831 --> 00:24:52,323
Rym: Now this isn't a problem on most new CRTs, but if you have an old CRT Don't use alcohol or ammonia on it when it's on.

413
00:24:52,383 --> 00:24:54,970
Scott: I don't know why you'd use ammonia or alcohol in any monitor.

414
00:24:55,273 --> 00:24:56,969
Rym: Well, actually I use alcohol to clean mine.

415
00:24:57,362 --> 00:25:00,157
Rym: Yeah The thing is some older CRTs.

416
00:25:00,478 --> 00:25:07,700
Rym: if you use something harsh like 90% alcohol on the front of it and it's on It'll crack not the whole thing.

417
00:25:07,781 --> 00:25:10,310
Rym: Just the shield on the end and ruin your monitor.

418
00:25:10,853 --> 00:25:18,200
Rym: so if you're ever gonna clean your monitor with a chemical turn it off first, I Always cleaned my CRT with just glass plus.

419
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,303
Scott: the same way clean the TV.

420
00:25:19,483 --> 00:25:22,772
Rym: I you know, it's in glass plus got ammonia Really?

421
00:25:23,014 --> 00:25:24,968
Scott: Yeah, but it was just water and blue.

422
00:25:25,872 --> 00:25:30,509
Rym: No, it's water and ammonia and then blue food coloring because it's trying to rip off Windex.

423
00:25:32,251 --> 00:25:34,237
Scott: Wow, the Windex is trying to rip off glass plus.

424
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:35,881
Rym: now index came first.

425
00:25:36,022 --> 00:25:36,403
Scott: Are you sure?

426
00:25:36,724 --> 00:25:38,710
Rym: I'm pretty sure about a hundred percent sure.

427
00:25:39,191 --> 00:25:40,978
Scott: Well, whatever it doesn't matter which one came first.

428
00:25:41,018 --> 00:25:43,508
Rym: So like I said before Scott screwed up.

429
00:25:43,548 --> 00:25:44,834
Rym: Yeah ammonia All right.

430
00:25:45,115 --> 00:25:45,879
Rym: Ammonia is a good thing.

431
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,784
Rym: Alcohol is a good thing.

432
00:25:46,824 --> 00:25:50,069
Rym: Just make sure it's off and Don't use a paper towel.

433
00:25:51,073 --> 00:25:51,659
Scott: It could be a nice one.

434
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,439
Scott: those nice soft paper towels Yeah, but generally don't get that.

435
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,110
Scott: don't get the chafee store brand one.

436
00:25:56,170 --> 00:26:02,090
Rym: Well, even generally if you're ever cleaning glass You don't want to use paper towel because paper towel is basically high-grade sandpaper.

437
00:26:02,331 --> 00:26:04,950
Scott: So Rym doesn't have LCD so he doesn't know what to do with them.

438
00:26:05,051 --> 00:26:07,070
Rym: But well, I know what to do with them because I have my work.

439
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:08,804
Rym: I just don't have one right here in front of me.

440
00:26:08,824 --> 00:26:11,917
Scott: No, anyway LCDs, they're not made of glass.

441
00:26:11,957 --> 00:26:15,191
Scott: They have all this glass in the inside somewhere, but you don't worry about that There's.

442
00:26:15,312 --> 00:26:29,070
Scott: it's a piece of plastic in the front and it scratches really freakin easily and it's pretty much irreparable if you damage it in any way and It's gonna be real visible like you're gonna see this hideous mark whenever you turn your monitor on it'll it'll bother you.

443
00:26:29,191 --> 00:26:31,725
Rym: So just follow whatever instructions came with your LCD.

444
00:26:31,765 --> 00:26:32,710
Scott: You got to be real careful.

445
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,309
Scott: You're gonna need to get like these.

446
00:26:34,932 --> 00:26:42,782
Scott: Well, you know most LCDs come with instructions and usually a little pad, yeah, sometimes they come with instructions But I've never seen them come with a cleaning pad ever.

447
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:44,550
Rym: Ah, the ones we got at work came with them.

448
00:26:44,791 --> 00:26:45,734
Rym: Those Dells come with them.

449
00:26:46,316 --> 00:26:53,019
Scott: Dells might yeah, but if you go to Staples, they have these microfiber cloths and those are pretty much you can just use it like.

450
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,920
Scott: I thought you can get one and use it forever to just clean the dust off the monitor.

451
00:26:57,688 --> 00:27:02,585
Scott: and Maybe once a year once every few months you'll get they have this little kit.

452
00:27:02,645 --> 00:27:08,470
Scott: That's like a wet wipey A dry wipey and then of course another microfiber cloth.

453
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:15,516
Scott: so what you do is you do the wet one and then a dry one and then you wipe the dust off and That like cleans off any sort of.

454
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:21,163
Scott: if you get like maybe like a wet sticky thing on your monitor or something like that That's how you get it off.

455
00:27:21,811 --> 00:27:23,215
Rym: Just basically don't ever like.

456
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:27,890
Rym: if there's grease don't just wipe it off with your shirt ever or paper towel ever or like a washcloth.

457
00:27:28,091 --> 00:27:28,994
Rym: You'll ruin it.

458
00:27:29,395 --> 00:27:32,164
Scott: They really should start making LCD screens that are more resistant.

459
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:32,926
Scott: I don't know why they don't.

460
00:27:33,408 --> 00:27:40,870
Rym: it's kind of A lot of you a lot of CRTs even newer ones are real easy to damage too because you might think it's glass.

461
00:27:40,991 --> 00:27:49,195
Rym: But usually there's a coating on top of the glass mmm, some sort of reflecto thing or an anti-glare thing and Like it's the same with eyeglasses.

462
00:27:49,637 --> 00:27:55,110
Rym: eyeglasses are real durable until you get anti-fog or anti-glare coatings on them Then they're real fragile.

463
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,689
Scott: Mmm, someone should do something about this.

464
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:58,934
Rym: Yeah, there's really no way.

465
00:27:58,995 --> 00:28:00,039
Rym: like my glasses.

466
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:01,123
Rym: when I got them I had a choice.

467
00:28:01,204 --> 00:28:04,461
Rym: I could either get really durable or Absolutely, no glare at all.

468
00:28:04,964 --> 00:28:05,890
Rym: I chose no glare at all.

469
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:13,288
Rym: So I don't see a reflection of my eyeball in front of me all the time Mmm, but if I so much as like Nick my glasses, they'll just they're good.

470
00:28:13,308 --> 00:28:13,669
Rym: They're done.

471
00:28:14,771 --> 00:28:17,659
Scott: Wow, you won't just see like a nick of eyeball.

472
00:28:17,699 --> 00:28:18,943
Scott: You'll see like a full eyeball.

473
00:28:19,003 --> 00:28:20,106
Scott: I don't know what.

474
00:28:20,126 --> 00:28:22,273
Scott: I don't know What was that?

475
00:28:22,293 --> 00:28:27,150
Scott: I mean if you only scratch like say the corner of it, then I'll see a scratch.

476
00:28:27,692 --> 00:28:31,929
Scott: well, yeah, but you won't see like your anti-glareness won't be.

477
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:33,512
Rym: No, no, what did?

478
00:28:33,572 --> 00:28:40,253
Rym: the point is that the anti-glare is a really really really fragile coat and it scratches really easily and the scratches Are very visible.

479
00:28:40,715 --> 00:28:43,990
Rym: So if I scratch my glasses, there's now a giant scratch in my vision forever.

480
00:28:45,251 --> 00:28:47,502
Rym: Yeah, if I didn't get that then I'd have glare instead.

481
00:28:47,542 --> 00:28:48,145
Rym: It was a trade-off.

482
00:28:48,165 --> 00:28:51,034
Scott: It's good not to wear glasses All right.

483
00:28:51,859 --> 00:28:53,470
Scott: Is that all the hardware bits that need maintaining?

484
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:54,697
Scott: Sure.

485
00:28:55,105 --> 00:28:58,069
Scott: Oh Your wires in the back of your computer keep them neat.

486
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:02,409
Rym: Actually, you don't really need to bother as long as you can get to all of them.

487
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:07,150
Scott: Yeah, but you know, it's like if you keep adding things or taking things away, you'll just have a mess.

488
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,663
Rym: I've noticed most people don't plug much into their computer nowadays.

489
00:29:10,724 --> 00:29:12,310
Rym: anything you plug in you plug into the front.

490
00:29:12,471 --> 00:29:13,255
Rym: Yes, little USB.

491
00:29:13,316 --> 00:29:14,402
Scott: Yeah, that's the best way to do.

492
00:29:14,422 --> 00:29:15,890
Scott: it is you have a really new computer.

493
00:29:15,991 --> 00:29:22,626
Scott: A lot of people just have like, you know A power cable an ethernet cable and a monitor cable and everything else is USBs in the front.

494
00:29:22,907 --> 00:29:23,830
Scott: That's the really good way.

495
00:29:24,332 --> 00:29:26,593
Rym: cable Microphone cable.

496
00:29:27,377 --> 00:29:29,809
Scott: Well, if you have a microphone gotta have a microphone.

497
00:29:30,638 --> 00:29:33,406
Scott: See I realize at work I don't really have so much like.

498
00:29:33,426 --> 00:29:41,886
Scott: I Use like six USB holes and like only like two things go in the power strip But at home I use like eight holes on the power strip.

499
00:29:41,926 --> 00:29:42,469
Scott: It's crazy.

500
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:48,130
Scott: Yeah, all right, so maintaining the software.

501
00:29:49,036 --> 00:29:53,676
Rym: If you're a Mac user other than the file Organize a bit you really don't need to listen to this.

502
00:29:54,097 --> 00:29:54,919
Rym: your Mac just works.

503
00:29:55,662 --> 00:29:55,982
Scott: Yeah.

504
00:29:56,404 --> 00:30:01,239
Scott: Well, there are some things you need to maintain like Don't let you know gonna make your serious.

505
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:05,299
Scott: software is up to date all the time, you know But Mac has a lot of update thing.

506
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:05,882
Scott: I'm pretty sure.

507
00:30:05,902 --> 00:30:06,485
Scott: yeah, hence.

508
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:07,369
Rym: You don't need to worry about it.

509
00:30:07,891 --> 00:30:13,332
Scott: Yeah, well you do have to click on it, you know to update whenever they say you should Windows.

510
00:30:13,433 --> 00:30:15,589
Rym: honestly, just let it auto update.

511
00:30:16,511 --> 00:30:24,608
Scott: Yeah, I mean there might be some Windows updates that are disagreeable But if you don't get them, you'll be sorry later anyway, because while they're disagreeable, there's no alternative.

512
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:30,227
Rym: Yeah It's not like you can say oh I just won't install that one ever because then you you're open to a vulnerability forever.

513
00:30:30,769 --> 00:30:35,310
Scott: and with Linux depending on your distribution There's some sort of update system in Ubuntu.

514
00:30:35,511 --> 00:30:42,495
Scott: It just kind of says hey update me but in like gen 2 you have to do it manually and I mean just basically just keep Up-to-date maybe once a month.

515
00:30:42,535 --> 00:30:47,374
Rym: just get all your packages get all whatever you need to have updated using whatever automatic thing you have And do it.

516
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:47,859
Rym: Yep.

517
00:30:48,607 --> 00:30:48,869
Scott: All right.

518
00:30:49,372 --> 00:30:58,177
Scott: So especially on Windows there will be software where you don't have an automatic update system And where the software doesn't have its own Automatic update systems you.

519
00:30:58,237 --> 00:31:01,749
Scott: what you want to do is you want to check, you know the website for that software every?

520
00:31:02,812 --> 00:31:04,809
Scott: Month or two to see if there's a new version.

521
00:31:05,332 --> 00:31:11,880
Rym: I mean if that unless it's a some sort of web thing, you don't need to worry unless you need a new feature There's really no reason to upgrade.

522
00:31:12,182 --> 00:31:17,070
Rym: Well, there's a known bug Or it's something that could give you a vulnerability depends on how often you use it.

523
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:25,230
Scott: I mean if it's something you never ever use and you just have it and you use it like once a year and it does What you need it to do don't even you know bother?

524
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,919
Rym: Well, not even not so much how much you use it.

525
00:31:26,939 --> 00:31:27,904
Rym: It's just if you need it.

526
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:33,090
Rym: if you need an update I mean I use cool at it 2000 and there were actually a lot of updates for it.

527
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:36,202
Rym: I never updated it once in the like five years.

528
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:38,210
Rym: I used it because it worked perfectly.

529
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:41,470
Rym: I had no reason to update it and none of those updates fixed a vulnerability.

530
00:31:42,571 --> 00:31:44,477
Scott: Yeah, but their updates might add features.

531
00:31:44,517 --> 00:31:48,169
Scott: then you might not realize you don't want them and that you want them until you have them.

532
00:31:48,631 --> 00:31:50,363
Rym: Yeah, if I need a feature then I go and get it.

533
00:31:50,504 --> 00:31:50,947
Rym: I don't need it.

534
00:31:51,027 --> 00:31:51,410
Rym: I don't care.

535
00:31:51,591 --> 00:31:57,517
Scott: I mean if I what you went by that logic, you should be using like Firefox 1/2, you know It has all this features that you use.

536
00:31:57,537 --> 00:32:02,616
Rym: you don't use any of the other now because the early Firefox's don't have the primary Feature which is don't crash.

537
00:32:03,017 --> 00:32:03,940
Scott: they didn't crash for me.

538
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,990
Rym: The early Firefox's really didn't like my computer.

539
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,600
Scott: I had some issues with them and it's an issue with your computer.

540
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,030
Rym: But anyway, my computer is an old piece of crap.

541
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:12,641
Rym: What do you want?

542
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:16,729
Rym: Firefox works fine now after the 1.0 days it sure does.

543
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:23,487
Scott: But you know, I tend to just unless there's like, you know something removed in the newer version.

544
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:31,584
Scott: like a lot of times What will happen is like you'll get iTunes and then the next version of iTunes will have something worse like a DRM or something.

545
00:32:32,086 --> 00:32:33,290
Scott: then you want to hold back.

546
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:38,250
Rym: That always doesn't work anymore though, you know because most things just won't accept old versions.

547
00:32:38,491 --> 00:32:43,770
Scott: Yeah, like PSP and stuff where you know, you put in a new game and it upgrades your firmware.

548
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:46,102
Rym: But anyway, we don't really need to talk about this.

549
00:32:46,142 --> 00:32:47,026
Rym: just keep up-to-date.

550
00:32:47,247 --> 00:32:47,730
Scott: Update your software.

551
00:32:49,953 --> 00:32:51,739
Rym: All I keep up-to-date organize your files.

552
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:52,582
Rym: That's really it.

553
00:32:53,324 --> 00:32:59,801
Scott: Well, you also want to What like if you have Windows you got to keep your registry clean.

554
00:32:59,821 --> 00:33:00,904
Rym: No, you don't.

555
00:33:01,587 --> 00:33:02,449
Rym: that's taken care of.

556
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,929
Rym: now If you use like XP, it keeps it pretty clean.

557
00:33:05,481 --> 00:33:06,533
Scott: No The only things.

558
00:33:06,613 --> 00:33:16,230
Scott: a lot of times if programs if the programs that you install and uninstall Aren't written properly or the uninstallers aren't written properly your registry can become full of crap real quick.

559
00:33:17,072 --> 00:33:20,304
Rym: See the problem with saying that is there's no easy way to clean out the registry.

560
00:33:20,805 --> 00:33:22,090
Rym: So that's really an advanced thing.

561
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:22,912
Scott: Well, there are.

562
00:33:22,972 --> 00:33:24,698
Scott: there are some registry program.

563
00:33:24,778 --> 00:33:27,607
Rym: every registry cleaner I've ever seen is not worth using.

564
00:33:27,647 --> 00:33:28,690
Rym: they're very dangerous.

565
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:30,838
Rym: They usually remove keys you need now.

566
00:33:30,878 --> 00:33:33,689
Scott: There is one that is actually made by Microsoft that I use.

567
00:33:34,052 --> 00:33:44,823
Scott: Yeah, wait the one that you can get from Windows update No, the one that you can get from the Microsoft website and like a Microsoft developer website, uh-huh I think it's a power tool or something.

568
00:33:44,843 --> 00:33:45,890
Rym: Honestly Scott may disagree.

569
00:33:46,051 --> 00:33:47,298
Rym: I say just ignore your registry.

570
00:33:47,318 --> 00:33:49,390
Rym: if you don't know what your registry does just ignore it.

571
00:33:49,672 --> 00:33:51,370
Scott: You don't even have to go into the register to use it.

572
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,215
Scott: It's just a thing.

573
00:33:52,255 --> 00:33:54,649
Scott: you click on and you say clean my registry and it goes clean.

574
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:59,810
Rym: Yeah, see I say it doesn't even matter because it really won't affect your performance.

575
00:34:00,019 --> 00:34:06,490
Scott: Oh, no See that's the actually not true because the perform and the registry when Windows computers are going slow.

576
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:15,570
Scott: If you actually like monitor or debug Windows computers to see what they're doing They do hard drive hits to the registry like like every freaking second.

577
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,413
Rym: Yeah, and you know what?

578
00:34:16,634 --> 00:34:18,902
Rym: That's really only an issue if you've been spy word.

579
00:34:19,384 --> 00:34:28,679
Rym: No, it really just you know Unless you've been spy word or you install and uninstall applications on it on an obscene basis You're not gonna have this problem.

580
00:34:29,163 --> 00:34:30,030
Scott: You will have this problem.

581
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:35,347
Scott: In fact on brand new Windows systems just fresh installed the registry is hit constantly.

582
00:34:35,387 --> 00:34:36,971
Scott: That's the way windows Hit.

583
00:34:37,192 --> 00:34:46,710
Rym: I'm saying you won't have a problem beyond what Windows already has unless you install or uninstall programs Obscenely or you have spyware that made your register huge.

584
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:49,079
Scott: Well, the thing is the registry doesn't just grow.

585
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:50,824
Scott: unless it does actually just grow.

586
00:34:50,844 --> 00:34:51,467
Scott: watch go.

587
00:34:53,013 --> 00:34:58,471
Rym: No, if you take a Windows computer and boot it and just leave it running the registry is not going to grow magically on its Own.

588
00:34:58,773 --> 00:35:02,050
Scott: it won't grow magically on its own, but we're assuming you're actually using the computer.

589
00:35:02,151 --> 00:35:04,564
Rym: All right, if you're just using it, you don't install anything.

590
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:05,550
Rym: It's not gonna grow much.

591
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:06,634
Scott: It actually grows.

592
00:35:06,695 --> 00:35:14,065
Scott: just browsing the web and you know doing things in your control panel The registry gets bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger doesn't get that much bigger.

593
00:35:14,105 --> 00:35:16,313
Scott: unless you go look at it You'll be very surprised.

594
00:35:16,554 --> 00:35:21,969
Rym: Yeah, I've looked at it often because I do a lot of wine work with wine in at work.

595
00:35:22,391 --> 00:35:25,332
Rym: yeah wine work it with wine at work and I do.

596
00:35:25,493 --> 00:35:34,910
Rym: I look at my registry on a regular basis because the main thing I do is I get a Windows program to work In wine, but and then I have to go through look at all the register keys and everything and import them into wine and Linux.

597
00:35:35,532 --> 00:35:37,237
Rym: And I see my registry on a regular basis.

598
00:35:37,298 --> 00:35:37,679
Rym: You know what.

599
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,010
Rym: it's been the same size for like six months.

600
00:35:41,592 --> 00:35:43,239
Scott: Oh in wine, it's very different.

601
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:50,163
Scott: because no no in Windows when I look at it I know the registry on my laptop for work is constantly crazy.

602
00:35:50,183 --> 00:35:51,868
Rym: What do you mean constantly crazy?

603
00:35:51,908 --> 00:35:52,450
Rym: Is it growing?

604
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:53,152
Rym: How big is it?

605
00:35:53,754 --> 00:35:58,790
Scott: It's pretty scarily big and I ran it because you don't realize it's like 60 or 70 megabytes is not scarily big.

606
00:35:59,192 --> 00:36:00,939
Scott: Yeah, I know but that's that's about the size.

607
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,667
Scott: Usually this is like hundreds of megabytes.

608
00:36:02,728 --> 00:36:12,804
Rym: It's huge Alright, then you must have installed or uninstalled things or have a profile with a lot of weird things set because the registry doesn't just Do that on its own it does just do that on its own.

609
00:36:12,885 --> 00:36:14,090
Rym: No, it doesn't it does.

610
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:15,996
Scott: I read many things about it back in the day.

611
00:36:16,097 --> 00:36:16,839
Scott: Alright fine.

612
00:36:17,281 --> 00:36:20,050
Rym: I think you're wrong and kind of paranoid about this.

613
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:23,504
Scott: Anyway, you should still just make sure the registry doesn't get out of control.

614
00:36:23,866 --> 00:36:24,790
Rym: Yeah, that's what Scott.

615
00:36:24,931 --> 00:36:29,110
Rym: I say ignore your registry if you don't know what it is because you're not really gonna be able to do anything with it.

616
00:36:29,372 --> 00:36:33,949
Scott: Well, you don't have to actually go and mess with it You know, if you don't know you just keep an eye on it.

617
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:36,504
Rym: Wait, wait, if you don't know, how can you keep an eye on it?

618
00:36:36,584 --> 00:36:38,804
Scott: You just look at the size of it Okay, and you see it get bigger.

619
00:36:38,844 --> 00:36:39,249
Rym: What do you do?

620
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:45,456
Scott: If you don't know anything about it, you run the little handy-dandy cleaning program and you see if it gets any smaller Okay, and say it doesn't.

621
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:48,391
Scott: well then it is probably nothing bad in it that you know It's.

622
00:36:48,451 --> 00:36:48,572
Scott: it's.

623
00:36:48,612 --> 00:36:51,426
Rym: the correct size though is usually if there's something bad in the register.

624
00:36:51,467 --> 00:36:52,009
Rym: It's spyware.

625
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:55,039
Scott: Yeah, the spyware is the number one thing that gets in there.

626
00:36:55,059 --> 00:36:58,190
Rym: It's pretty much the only thing nowadays unless you install crap old programs.

627
00:36:58,571 --> 00:37:00,559
Scott: Oh crap old bro, that's the other thing you never.

628
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,449
Scott: if you if you can avoid it don't use crap old programs.

629
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:06,254
Scott: Look for something that's new and does things properly.

630
00:37:06,274 --> 00:37:16,390
