1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,812
Rym: It's Wednesday April 26th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:12,852 --> 00:00:16,421
Rym: We bring you our coverage of ToraCon 2006.

3
00:00:16,421 --> 00:00:18,804
Scott: Let's do this Today work.

4
00:00:18,864 --> 00:00:27,077
Scott: I was setting up all the you know stuff on my fresh work windows crap Laptop thing I send.

5
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:34,569
Rym: sometimes I like doing that because it means my computer is going to be not bogged down by all the crap that I'm about to put On it, but at the same time.

6
00:00:34,629 --> 00:00:35,855
Rym: I hate doing that.

7
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:46,400
Scott: yeah Surprisingly I had to reboot only like four or five times to do all the windows updates Oh, and I had to add two or three times to do the office updates.

8
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:50,591
Scott: Anyway, one of the things I had to do is update iTunes now.

9
00:00:51,453 --> 00:00:56,312
Scott: I originally thought hey look at this You know all I really do with iTunes is podcast.

10
00:00:56,734 --> 00:00:59,842
Scott: I'll save my opml and It's okay.

11
00:00:59,882 --> 00:01:04,959
Scott: if I delete all the mp3s off my hard drive because they're on my iPod - they all get redown loaded.

12
00:01:05,883 --> 00:01:09,914
Scott: No no no, so I'm like all right.

13
00:01:10,456 --> 00:01:19,379
Scott: You know and then when I Import my opml and then get my podcast list back It'll just get all the mp3s from my iPod and reload the whole thing.

14
00:01:20,201 --> 00:01:22,307
Scott: Okay, I didn't quite work that way.

15
00:01:22,647 --> 00:01:23,269
Rym: What happened?

16
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,920
Scott: well first of all it didn't let me import the opml like I couldn't.

17
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:28,664
Scott: I went to import.

18
00:01:28,704 --> 00:01:30,051
Scott: I chose the opml file.

19
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:31,660
Scott: I clicked ok nothing happened.

20
00:01:31,781 --> 00:01:35,540
Rym: Did you try getting some other opml and importing it just to make sure it wasn't yours?

21
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,274
Scott: This is opml that I had exported from iTunes.

22
00:01:39,374 --> 00:01:42,307
Rym: Oh, yeah, but just in case I mean I would have taken someone else's and just ride.

23
00:01:42,327 --> 00:01:48,685
Scott: I don't even think about that, but no it wasn't importing opml, so I Manually added all the.

24
00:01:48,826 --> 00:01:55,271
Scott: well that's the other part of the story, but I manually added podcast to the feed And then I plugged in the iPod.

25
00:01:55,795 --> 00:01:56,399
Scott: What did it do?

26
00:01:57,645 --> 00:02:04,340
Scott: It didn't take the You know mp3s off my iPod and match them to the feeds to which I was subscribed.

27
00:02:04,581 --> 00:02:10,280
Scott: No, it took the feeds to which I was subscribed and overwrote everything on my on my podcast on my iPod.

28
00:02:11,163 --> 00:02:13,091
Scott: So I lost a whole bunch of stuff.

29
00:02:13,252 --> 00:02:18,365
Scott: I could go redown load it, but anyway Yeah, iTunes isn't so great.

30
00:02:18,887 --> 00:02:19,227
Scott: No.

31
00:02:19,308 --> 00:02:23,820
Scott: It's it's not really straight like in in its goal to be really simple.

32
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:26,580
Scott: It makes it really difficult to do.

33
00:02:27,742 --> 00:02:36,440
Scott: To get it to do exactly what you want it to do You know because it's really only designed to work if you use it in one specific way.

34
00:02:36,581 --> 00:02:39,296
Scott: So if you try to make it do anything else it just fucks you.

35
00:02:39,316 --> 00:02:48,024
Rym: well I'm sure I'll be running a follow of all that since now that it really looks like I'm gonna pick one of these jobs I've been offered for the past month and At that point.

36
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:58,079
Rym: I'm just gonna buy it on a spending spring by an iPod gonna buy an i-trip Maybe a motorcycle yeah, I think we should just have one Apple computer to manage all this shit.

37
00:02:58,986 --> 00:02:59,692
Rym: That'd be kind of nice.

38
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,999
Scott: I gotta say yeah We should have one Apple computer one Windows computer and all the other computers can be Linux.

39
00:03:04,381 --> 00:03:07,800
Rym: I'm thinking to turn in my current computer when I get the new one into our Windows computer.

40
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:12,497
Rym: Maybe I mean or you could turn your computer, which is significantly faster than mine into that.

41
00:03:12,698 --> 00:03:13,019
Scott: We'll see.

42
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:18,093
Scott: Anyway, the point is is that because I had to manually read all these podcasts.

43
00:03:18,895 --> 00:03:30,314
Scott: I ended up dropping a whole bunch You know because they just weren't worth adding again, or like there are a couple of them like that's harsh I mean how bad you have to be to where you were only listening out of habit.

44
00:03:30,374 --> 00:03:33,847
Scott: and now that it's no no no like I wasn't even listening like NPR story of the day.

45
00:03:33,907 --> 00:03:37,959
Scott: right NPR stories of the day range from like five minutes to like 20 minutes.

46
00:03:38,282 --> 00:03:38,654
Scott: Right yeah.

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,600
Scott: So I just kind of collected them and I would listen to them if I ran out of everything else that I had.

48
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:48,540
Scott: But I ended up not listening to them and just downloading like a bajillion episode.

49
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,350
Scott: So I just didn't read that.

50
00:03:50,692 --> 00:03:51,879
Scott: it just wasn't worth my time.

51
00:03:52,321 --> 00:03:55,896
Rym: You think you'd get to all that with an hour drive each way home to and from work.

52
00:03:56,097 --> 00:04:05,787
Scott: Yeah, the other one That's pretty sad is is IT conversations, which has all the recordings of people speaking at different Conferences around the world and all that stuff.

53
00:04:06,228 --> 00:04:10,823
Scott: and you know that's a feed where you really don't want to download anything in there Automatically.

54
00:04:10,843 --> 00:04:15,102
Scott: you just want to look through and see what comes and download very specific Episodes.

55
00:04:15,443 --> 00:04:19,959
Scott: and I had about like 20 of those things that I hadn't had time to listen to yet that are kind of wanted to.

56
00:04:20,825 --> 00:04:24,993
Scott: but Again, it just wasn't worth it to read that feed and go through it.

57
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:27,980
Scott: So I tried to add like Like.

58
00:04:28,622 --> 00:04:31,811
Scott: they have separate feeds on IT conversations or different categories.

59
00:04:31,832 --> 00:04:34,559
Scott: So I was like, okay, I'll just add the programming one.

60
00:04:35,222 --> 00:04:38,819
Scott: The programming one hasn't had a new item in it in like a year.

61
00:04:39,602 --> 00:04:42,289
Scott: Great it was totally not useful at all.

62
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,916
Rym: I'm really looking forward to dealing with all that.

63
00:04:45,277 --> 00:04:51,715
Scott: Yeah, but In addition, I added a whole bunch of new podcasts and what's kind of scary is like.

64
00:04:52,036 --> 00:05:08,686
Scott: I have one anime podcast Which anime world order I added like three gaming podcasts to make up for the loss of gamers with jobs and we'll see which of them survive past, you know one episode and And You know, I have one.

65
00:05:08,706 --> 00:05:10,900
Scott: I have pretty much one podcast for every geekery.

66
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,772
Scott: I have a board game podcast a comic book podcast, whatever right see.

67
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:17,200
Rym: now wouldn't it be nice to consolidate all those into one?

68
00:05:17,361 --> 00:05:18,530
Scott: You know and listen to GeekNights.

69
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:18,792
Scott: Yeah.

70
00:05:18,873 --> 00:05:23,514
Scott: Yeah You've already done that but I have GeekNights on everyone.

71
00:05:23,554 --> 00:05:33,667
Rym: I need to listen to that for You know surprisingly we've been doing this so often and so long that it's got to the point to where after about a week I'll remember the topics I talk about.

72
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:36,597
Rym: but when I listen to myself, I don't remember saying half the things.

73
00:05:36,657 --> 00:05:49,071
Scott: I say no I'm not gonna remember saying this but the What scares me a lot is that I have three sports podcasts after what I did today Three three I have I have every day.

74
00:05:49,211 --> 00:05:59,777
Scott: I really actually discovered two of them today Because if I had television right like which I don't the things I would watch would be like f1 races Cartoons.

75
00:06:00,742 --> 00:06:07,420
Rym: I'd watch The Daily Show probably The Daily Show maybe Sports Center, maybe I'd watch occasional hockey games.

76
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,920
Rym: Yeah hockey only important hockey games cuz unless I'm at a hockey arena hockey's not that fun unless it's really a big game.

77
00:06:14,585 --> 00:06:17,948
Scott: See if I had HD TV I'd watch a lot more hockey than that cuz.

78
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:20,880
Scott: hockey like the enjoyment of hockey and HD is like doubled.

79
00:06:21,142 --> 00:06:23,640
Rym: Yeah, if HD had anything going for it other than sports.

80
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,660
Scott: But and I'd probably watch that show on ESPN with the two guys arguing right which is like the best sports news show.

81
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,382
Scott: There is that.

82
00:06:32,884 --> 00:06:40,932
Scott: the thing is I just got a podcast of the ESPN show with the two guys arguing Wait, isn't that the show that we originally considered using as the basis?

83
00:06:40,952 --> 00:06:42,840
Scott: that was that was my idea.

84
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:51,117
Scott: Yeah that we can make a show and be like those two guys only do geek topics instead of sports topics Of course, that didn't work out, but whatever.

85
00:06:51,137 --> 00:06:55,320
Rym: Yeah Well, we never really tried it because we settled into the format we're using now pretty quickly.

86
00:06:55,721 --> 00:06:58,350
Rym: Yeah, maybe we could do a Thursday like that once or twice.

87
00:06:58,711 --> 00:07:01,340
Scott: maybe it's you need a whole bunch of news items.

88
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,620
Scott: You need to do them really quickly and we always need to be on opposing viewpoints and all of them.

89
00:07:05,963 --> 00:07:07,117
Rym: Um, that's not that hard with us.

90
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,048
Rym: Let's go down far and we need it.

91
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:11,435
Scott: We need to use the sand timers.

92
00:07:11,756 --> 00:07:18,100
Scott: We got sand timers I know yeah, but then I got that there was a Sports Center podcast, which is like 10 minutes a day.

93
00:07:18,201 --> 00:07:25,715
Scott: You get Sports Center, which is like whoo, of course I probably might unsubscribe from that pretty quickly because the best part about Sports Center is like.

94
00:07:26,197 --> 00:07:27,280
Scott: you don't watch every sport.

95
00:07:27,562 --> 00:07:35,719
Scott: You maybe watch like your one team But especially during baseball season you watch Sports Center and you see like the amazing plays from every sport.

96
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,912
Rym: Yeah, because I mean baseball is to me a really boring sport to watch.

97
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,620
Rym: However, occasionally awesome things happen.

98
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:45,615
Scott: It's not just baseball is there even basketball which I really don't.

99
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:46,580
Rym: I don't like basketball

100
00:07:46,700 --> 00:08:00,656
Scott: But you watch Sports Center like for an hour in the morning before you go to school or work or whatever on TV And that was the best because you would just see Amazing plays from every single sport of the previous day in the United States.

101
00:08:00,736 --> 00:08:03,828
Rym: What works pretty well is just Searching on Google video.

102
00:08:04,453 --> 00:08:07,344
Rym: Yeah hockey fight Soccer goalie.

103
00:08:07,485 --> 00:08:19,400
Scott: Yeah, but eventually you run out of those, you know, this is like, you know The best of the best of yesterday and it's always pretty good, you know Like it's some guy in the Kansas City Royals makes like an amazing dive throw thing.

104
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:25,980
Scott: You're not gonna freaking know about it without no one watches the Kansas City Royals that people in Kansas City don't know.

105
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,347
Rym: There's two pairs two pairs two pairs.

106
00:08:28,768 --> 00:08:33,166
Scott: Yeah, but if there's an amazing play Sports Center, you know, you get that It's pretty good entertainment.

107
00:08:33,285 --> 00:08:36,198
Scott: I don't think there's a better morning TV show in this country.

108
00:08:36,861 --> 00:08:38,972
Rym: See to me that could definitely be the future of television.

109
00:08:39,032 --> 00:08:44,120
Rym: if good shows like that We're just video casts that I could watch at my leisure with no ads and no money.

110
00:08:44,532 --> 00:08:55,500
Scott: Yeah if like I won't pay 40 bucks a month to get cable to watch Sports Center every morning and have to wake up at a certain time to watch it But if I can download every Sports Center

111
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,320
Rym: I don't know how easy it would be to do that show if it weren't for the copyright restrictions.

112
00:08:59,702 --> 00:09:10,504
Rym: All you'd have to do is be a sports geek watch all the sports on TV Maybe have a table them all and then go to it pull out all the plays put them on a thing at the end and talk about sports every day or

113
00:09:10,565 --> 00:09:13,956
Scott: even better just have one guy and what.

114
00:09:14,057 --> 00:09:21,760
Scott: he has a bunch of Agents around the country so he gets a fan of every single team and they're gonna watch the game.

115
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:29,102
Scott: Anyway, yeah They edit out all the best plays and send it to this guy and then he pays them all together and then he talks over It.

116
00:09:29,386 --> 00:09:35,840
Scott: and there you have it Something that's not quite as quality as Sports Center but provides the same entertainment in the same content.

117
00:09:36,101 --> 00:09:41,469
Rym: Yeah, and anyone who would say that no one would do that for free Look at all the podcasts.

118
00:09:41,489 --> 00:09:42,053
Rym: We're all doing it.

119
00:09:42,194 --> 00:09:43,140
Scott: We'll do it for free.

120
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:50,440
Scott: The problem is that stupid Major League Baseball spy satellite with their expressed written consent instead of the implied verbal consent.

121
00:09:51,623 --> 00:09:52,690
Rym: We just need some focus in.

122
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:53,394
Scott: Yeah.

123
00:09:53,857 --> 00:09:56,264
Rym: All right Let's actually get to the news.

124
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:56,946
Scott: All right.

125
00:09:57,087 --> 00:10:06,656
Rym: now since it's anime day and we've got our coverage of torque on 2006 coming up I would like to say that Otakon has released a minor little press thing.

126
00:10:06,676 --> 00:10:17,913
Rym: That's kind of a warning that Considering the nature of it I think it's a good idea to tell all of you about it since I've realized that most people who go to Otakon have never Actually seen the Otakon website and don't bother following the forums.

127
00:10:18,154 --> 00:10:19,620
Scott: How else can you find out about Otakon?

128
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,619
Scott: There's no other way.

129
00:10:21,175 --> 00:10:24,640
Rym: Yeah But people word of mouth people just hear about it and then decide to go with a friend.

130
00:10:25,061 --> 00:10:29,660
Rym: Yeah, a lot of people apparently don't go to the Otakon website or at least don't go regularly.

131
00:10:30,061 --> 00:10:31,787
Rym: They go like once to see what the dates are.

132
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:36,987
Scott: if you're listening to this and we have somehow convinced you to Otakon or if You have a plan to go to Otakon.

133
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:38,172
Scott: You've never been before.

134
00:10:38,192 --> 00:10:39,417
Scott: maybe you have been before.

135
00:10:39,437 --> 00:10:40,843
Scott: it doesn't matter You need.

136
00:10:41,185 --> 00:10:43,656
Scott: if you're going to Otakon you must visit its website.

137
00:10:43,696 --> 00:10:45,830
Scott: if you don't have a computer I don't know how the hell you listen to this.

138
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:46,859
Scott: but go to the library.

139
00:10:47,741 --> 00:10:50,391
Scott: Go to the library and visit the Otakon website.

140
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:51,716
Scott: It is mandatory to visit.

141
00:10:51,736 --> 00:10:52,559
Rym: You know what you go.

142
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:56,271
Rym: No No, it's not mandatory anymore since they finally implemented the RSS feed.

143
00:10:56,612 --> 00:10:58,900
Scott: Yeah, but it's still pretty mandatory.

144
00:10:59,921 --> 00:11:21,050
Rym: Well, at least follow the RSS because there is a announcement on it that apparently some fairly unscrupulous travel agency Types have been offering magic Otakon packages that may or may not include privileges at the con membership badges preference in lines and Otakon has come out to say that they haven't sponsored anything.

145
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:33,304
Rym: and no one no one No one has the right to offer Otakon badges or any Otakon privileges or use the name Otakon in any way Except Otakon.

146
00:11:33,424 --> 00:11:39,692
Rym: Yeah, so if anyone says offers you like hey for a hundred bucks We'll get you a badge at a hotel room and blah.

147
00:11:40,335 --> 00:11:44,382
Rym: They're lying Scammers Ahoy.

148
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:49,820
Rym: now at the same time there are a lot of fan groups that put together like chartered bus it buses from certain cities.

149
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,471
Rym: I know there's one leaving New York City.

150
00:11:51,491 --> 00:11:59,720
Rym: Whoo, and Some people get together like hotel collectives where they get a bunch of people Strangers in and all sorts of fun things like that and that's cool.

151
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:07,717
Rym: And some travel agencies are offering like Otakon travel packages But the moment they say that they're doing anything involving Otakon itself.

152
00:12:07,757 --> 00:12:08,178
Rym: They're lying.

153
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:14,254
Scott: Yeah kind of makes you wonder about some of those package deals for other places like.

154
00:12:14,294 --> 00:12:21,440
Scott: I know this you the down is always down At Disney World as a bunch of packages you can buy but most some of those are legitimate at least most of them.

155
00:12:21,661 --> 00:12:26,260
Rym: Yeah, well even the ones that are legitimate they're usually not in any way affiliated with Disney World.

156
00:12:26,481 --> 00:12:27,685
Rym: Yeah, and that's the same thing.

157
00:12:27,725 --> 00:12:31,057
Rym: There is no such thing as any affiliated package for Otakon.

158
00:12:31,439 --> 00:12:34,491
Rym: Mm-hmm There are packages for Otakon but Otakon has nothing to do with them.

159
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:35,675
Rym: They don't endorse them.

160
00:12:35,716 --> 00:12:36,820
Rym: They don't promote them.

161
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,838
Rym: They have nothing to do at all.

162
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:43,480
Scott: You know, this really makes me wonder like I never really understood the point of the travel agent.

163
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:54,037
Scott: I mean if I want to go somewhere in a trip, right if it's somewhere in this hemisphere The only person I need to help me is triple-a and even then I could probably do without.

164
00:12:54,137 --> 00:12:54,880
Rym: in the very least.

165
00:12:55,322 --> 00:12:57,474
Rym: Orbits plus map quest equals gold.

166
00:12:57,936 --> 00:13:06,600
Scott: I know right And maybe just maybe I'll have to go get one of those books From the bookstore that tells you about the place and what you should not miss when you go there.

167
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,207
Rym: Yeah, that only be for a big trip.

168
00:13:08,268 --> 00:13:10,780
Rym: Like if we were going out to like the west coast for a week.

169
00:13:11,061 --> 00:13:11,843
Scott: Yeah, something like that.

170
00:13:12,385 --> 00:13:15,395
Scott: But if you're going to like a foreign country, right?

171
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:18,871
Scott: I need the book But I don't need a travel agent.

172
00:13:18,992 --> 00:13:24,959
Scott: all I really need is Maybe like a tour guide or a translator or something like that, you know.

173
00:13:25,301 --> 00:13:34,100
Rym: Well, it seems that most travel agencies offer deals Like they'll get a bulk rate for something and then they try to sell all the spots on the bulk rate.

174
00:13:34,241 --> 00:13:38,639
Rym: So if you go with one of their spots, you couldn't negotiate that bulk rate on your own.

175
00:13:39,081 --> 00:13:40,746
Rym: But they could because they have a lot of clients.

176
00:13:41,248 --> 00:13:44,218
Rym: Yeah, but then you're stuck in a bulk rate thing.

177
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:49,819
Scott: Yes That's the thing I'm talking about is like why would you ever want to go on a trip that like someone else?

178
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:59,711
Rym: Set up for you now at the same time some good travel agents I've seen because I was looking around I mean we're because we're thinking you know Both of us going somewhere weird next summer.

179
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:01,300
Rym: I'm like a vacation somewhere awesome.

180
00:14:01,802 --> 00:14:07,180
Rym: Well, there are a lot of travel agents that work locally in an area like say you want to go to France.

181
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:08,599
Rym: I'll just use France as an example.

182
00:14:09,423 --> 00:14:14,419
Rym: You can go through a normal travel agent or just call a hotel and stay at a Marriott and eat dinner it.

183
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:17,989
Rym: you know Hard-rock cafe and all the stuff that's here.

184
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:18,411
Scott: We can.

185
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:21,420
Scott: I'm sure that on our own we could find a better hotel in France.

186
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,706
Rym: Oh, yeah hotel but and eat at a better place.

187
00:14:23,967 --> 00:14:37,037
Rym: you could find a travel agent or at least someone out there who will help you who could Get you in touch with say the youth hostel or the chateau that lets like Tourists or boarders stay with them for a week or the cool ways to get around

188
00:14:37,057 --> 00:14:37,760
Scott: a bale of hay.

189
00:14:39,521 --> 00:14:42,557
Rym: Charlie Brown, is that what you're thinking about The Simpsons?

190
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:48,437
Scott: Oh Yeah season what one two one yeah episode like two or three.

191
00:14:48,477 --> 00:14:49,159
Rym: That's way back.

192
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,080
Rym: I barely remember that it was real early.

193
00:14:52,200 --> 00:15:03,167
Rym: I was thinking about the Charlie Brown where he went to France and he was mistreated and left in the barn Just like The Simpsons where Bart went to France and he was mistreated and left in a barn Yeah, and forced to drink antifreeze.

194
00:15:03,488 --> 00:15:05,495
Rym: Charlie Brown was he didn't drink the antifreeze.

195
00:15:05,796 --> 00:15:07,020
Rym: Yeah, they tried to make him drink it.

196
00:15:07,161 --> 00:15:09,758
Rym: Yeah, yeah, Charlie Brown didn't have to drink any antifreeze.

197
00:15:10,684 --> 00:15:13,319
Scott: Yeah, that's what you get for wearing a zigzag II shirt.

198
00:15:15,062 --> 00:15:15,885
Scott: That made no sense.

199
00:15:16,086 --> 00:15:16,608
Rym: All right.

200
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,194
Rym: All right, what's your news?

201
00:15:18,977 --> 00:15:29,277
Rym: Oh, so Katsuhiro Otomo who is perhaps the second or third Partially, well, you don't want to get yelled at by animal world order.

202
00:15:29,297 --> 00:15:29,960
Rym: Do you know?

203
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:37,673
Scott: okay, Miyazaki is like the king of anime especially anime movies and Tezuka the astro boy guy.

204
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:38,800
Scott: he's the king of manga.

205
00:15:39,642 --> 00:15:45,460
Scott: Otomo is like Next in line after those guys cuz he's kind of manga and anime both.

206
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:48,810
Rym: Well, I'm really curious what anime world order is gonna have to say about that.

207
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:51,058
Scott: He made freaking Akira.

208
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:53,591
Rym: Oh, yeah I don't disagree at all.

209
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:58,549
Scott: steam boy and memories Come on.

210
00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:03,785
Scott: All right anyway Cup noodle Freedom.

211
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,826
Scott: yeah cup noodle and Freedom this.

212
00:16:07,947 --> 00:16:11,220
Scott: this could have been a thing of the day, but I think it's news cuz it's anime day.

213
00:16:11,582 --> 00:16:13,559
Rym: I just this is something I really don't get.

214
00:16:14,363 --> 00:16:18,180
Scott: So cup noodle needed a commercial to sell cup noodle to Japanese people.

215
00:16:18,803 --> 00:16:28,184
Scott: They got Otomo one of the greatest anime makers of all time to make the commercial for them and their Campaign.

216
00:16:28,224 --> 00:16:31,000
Scott: their their marketing campaign slogan is freedom.

217
00:16:31,442 --> 00:16:33,269
Scott: What does cup noodle have to do with freedom?

218
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,213
Scott: I don't know.

219
00:16:34,614 --> 00:16:37,303
Scott: ask a ramenite but What that?

220
00:16:37,484 --> 00:16:44,185
Scott: okay, they pay this guy a lot of money and they got Utada Hikaru to sing a song Over the commercial.

221
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:45,309
Scott: what the hell?

222
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:46,232
Rym: I don't get it.

223
00:16:46,794 --> 00:16:47,236
Rym: You know what?

224
00:16:47,356 --> 00:16:48,480
Rym: I don't even like cup noodle.

225
00:16:48,982 --> 00:16:50,147
Scott: I don't like cup noodle either.

226
00:16:50,348 --> 00:16:54,803
Rym: I get I gotta go with a bowl noodle or at least the Sapporo Ichiban.

227
00:16:54,863 --> 00:16:56,168
Rym: Yeah, or the.

228
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,716
Rym: I personally like the kitsune with a bean curd.

229
00:16:58,736 --> 00:16:59,680
Rym: That's my favorite ramen.

230
00:17:00,863 --> 00:17:10,458
Scott: But still what's up with the Really expensive commercial of a freaking noodles that are more American than Japanese cup noodle.

231
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:18,196
Scott: Yeah Japanese people get better noodles than that and like any street corner And you make yeah, all right.

232
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:20,201
Rym: Yeah, I don't get but watch the commercial.

233
00:17:20,241 --> 00:17:23,164
Scott: it's it's entertaining because it's made by a master of anime.

234
00:17:23,184 --> 00:17:32,461
Scott: Oh Do we have some good things of the day today?

235
00:17:32,581 --> 00:17:34,270
Rym: Yeah, we didn't even have to try this time.

236
00:17:34,651 --> 00:17:37,078
Scott: You might have seen some of them though, but that's okay.

237
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:39,665
Rym: All right, so we've talked up V for Vendetta.

238
00:17:39,966 --> 00:17:41,230
Rym: It's a fantastic movie.

239
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,374
Rym: It's a fantastic comic.

240
00:17:42,715 --> 00:17:43,718
Rym: I was very impressed with it.

241
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,250
Rym: I have found a trailer to a movie that you might like even more.

242
00:17:48,012 --> 00:17:49,230
Rym: C for cookie.

243
00:17:50,331 --> 00:17:53,279
Scott: C is so cookie is good enough for me.

244
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,204
Rym: It's someone made this.

245
00:17:55,746 --> 00:17:57,210
Rym: it kind of doesn't sync up with the audio.

246
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:02,432
Rym: I thought it was my player but it really doesn't because they just took clips from Sesame Street and put them in to V for Vendetta.

247
00:18:02,452 --> 00:18:12,148
Rym: yeah, and then they put voices over it, but the voices are top-notch and I think the best part is when the count is like two last chances.

248
00:18:13,853 --> 00:18:16,203
Scott: Yeah, the count voice was in fact the worst voice though.

249
00:18:16,243 --> 00:18:19,280
Scott: It didn't sound like the count so much Yeah, but it had the spirit of the count.

250
00:18:19,462 --> 00:18:20,247
Scott: Yeah, it's what counts.

251
00:18:22,971 --> 00:18:26,649
Rym: That was not intentional, all right, here's a nice question for all of you out there.

252
00:18:27,553 --> 00:18:28,438
Rym: One watch this trailer.

253
00:18:28,478 --> 00:18:29,503
Rym: It's really well done and cool.

254
00:18:29,925 --> 00:18:30,790
Scott: It's a already trailers.

255
00:18:31,892 --> 00:18:35,442
Rym: In fact it's probably better than Titanic to the surface.

256
00:18:35,924 --> 00:18:37,829
Scott: Yeah, that one wasn't that impressive.

257
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,599
Rym: well That's because you haven't seen Titanic.

258
00:18:40,143 --> 00:18:41,310
Scott: don't really care about Titanic.

259
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:42,236
Scott: I'm never gonna see it.

260
00:18:42,578 --> 00:18:51,530
Rym: if someone out there can find us a video of The batty bat the batty bat batty bat batty batty batty batty batty batty one two three count.

261
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:53,074
Scott: Yeah, okay.

262
00:18:53,536 --> 00:18:55,041
Scott: Yeah, I know Betty bet well.

263
00:18:55,121 --> 00:18:57,450
Rym: We actually will give some sort of prize because we can't find it.

264
00:18:57,751 --> 00:19:05,850
Scott: Yeah, I tried to search on YouTube and Google video for a video of The batty bat the original Sesame Street batty bat, and I couldn't find it at home.

265
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:10,970
Scott: I actually have a VHS tape that like this my sisters and my brothers, and they were little.

266
00:19:11,752 --> 00:19:16,430
Scott: It's like a Sesame Street dance tape or something and it shows you how to dance the batty bat using.

267
00:19:19,112 --> 00:19:21,890
Scott: So I could get that and dance the batty bat.

268
00:19:22,071 --> 00:19:25,162
Scott: But I don't think I don't have the original batty bat.

269
00:19:25,182 --> 00:19:29,710
Scott: with the bats that are hanging from the ceiling accounts little room with his organ.

270
00:19:30,192 --> 00:19:34,386
Scott: You know moving the little wing-a-lings back and forth and spinning around and you know singing.

271
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:38,814
Rym: Yeah, I want that video All right, yeah now really We'll give you something.

272
00:19:38,935 --> 00:19:42,795
Rym: because I know a lot of times we say oh if you give us something and we trail off no We'll give you something.

273
00:19:43,137 --> 00:19:44,587
Rym: I don't know what it'll be one day.

274
00:19:44,647 --> 00:19:45,351
Scott: what we're gonna Do?

275
00:19:45,371 --> 00:19:46,877
Rym: you know it will be like all those webcomic artists?

276
00:19:47,218 --> 00:19:48,141
Rym: We'll give them a sketch.

277
00:19:48,643 --> 00:19:50,389
Scott: Yeah, I'll give you a sketch.

278
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,486
Scott: Ready here's the dirty Vika skin.

00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:58,229
Scott: Oh Tits go go.

280
00:20:00,956 --> 00:20:07,525
Scott: No, what we'll probably do is one day when we have a logo and such We'll buy a lot of merch and we'll get like merch.

281
00:20:07,565 --> 00:20:12,242
Scott: that costs money like t-shirts And then we'll get free shit merch like stickers.

282
00:20:12,282 --> 00:20:13,707
Scott: and whenever we say we'll give you something.

283
00:20:13,767 --> 00:20:17,130
Scott: It'll just be a sticker Yeah, or something else cheap like a keychain.

284
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:22,530
Rym: And I remember just now that someone did answer one of our previous questions in the forum and I forget who it was.

285
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:31,669
Scott: But the next time I remember it I'll say something on the air cuz tomorrow I'll go through our emails in the forum finding all the people who are on the list and I'll make a list.

286
00:20:33,957 --> 00:20:38,370
Scott: And then what we'll do is when the time comes and we get merch I'll send everyone.

287
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:43,870

Rym: Yeah, come to Otakon and you'll see us.

290
00:20:48,989 --> 00:20:57,741
Scott: Yep All right, so my thing of the day you might have seen this already because it's pretty popular It's a secret Wars reenactment video.

291
00:20:57,781 --> 00:21:00,027
Scott: It's it's basically parodying two things.

292
00:21:00,268 --> 00:21:04,784
Scott: Well three things It's parodying stupid comic fans all things all things.

293
00:21:05,086 --> 00:21:06,190
Scott: It's Monty Python day.

294
00:21:08,813 --> 00:21:11,830
Scott: It's parodying three things nerdy comic fans.

295
00:21:13,403 --> 00:21:18,626
Scott: So Marvel secret wars and those people who reenact the Civil War.

296
00:21:18,887 --> 00:21:22,176
Rym: those people are cool But they're also scary like SCA people.

297
00:21:22,296 --> 00:21:22,958
Scott: cool yet.

298
00:21:23,058 --> 00:21:23,499
Scott: Scary.

299
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,775
Rym: I watched a reenactment of a battle from the Civil War once Mm-hmm.

300
00:21:28,795 --> 00:21:35,609
Rym: It looked really realistic and well done and it was kind of cool But at the same time they got a little too into it.

301
00:21:35,811 --> 00:21:38,369
Scott: Yeah, that's that's what bothers me is, you know people get into it.

302
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:44,670
Scott: Anyway, if you don't know let me explain secret wars really quickly because I had never even read it.

303
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,759
Scott: I ordered the books though.

304
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:47,029
Scott: She should be here in like two months.

305
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:56,758
Scott: But secret wars is like the second time ever that comic books had like this giant event Right that had a bunch of million characters in it.

306
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:00,790
Scott: And what basically happened is like I think it was the cosmic cube.

307
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:08,840
Scott: I'm not sure but there was something in Central Park and all the Marvel superheroes went into it and it took them to some other Dimension where crazy shit happened.

308
00:22:09,603 --> 00:22:11,470
Rym: See this is why I don't like comics.

309
00:22:11,574 --> 00:22:21,390
Scott: Yeah And basically spider-man with the galactic sewing machine or whatever the fuck it was Made the black and white spider-man costume that eventually became venom, you know.

310
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,061
Rym: That's why I also don't like comics.

311
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:29,510
Scott: and the thing Was able to switch between being the big rock guy and a human self.

312
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:33,728
Scott: So he stayed there and everyone else went back and they fought a bunch of villains.

313
00:22:33,748 --> 00:22:34,290
Scott: and that was it.

314
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:37,670
Scott: It was a secret war cuz no one knew about it because it took place in this other dimension.

315
00:22:37,832 --> 00:22:38,950
Scott: That's why it's called secret wars.

316
00:22:40,857 --> 00:22:42,247
Rym: so a sewing machine.

317
00:22:43,312 --> 00:22:46,330
Scott: It's kind of a sewing machine kind of not but it's essential.

318
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:50,583
Scott: They don't use the word sewing machine, but it's essentially a galactic sewing machine.

319
00:22:50,884 --> 00:22:51,807
Rym: Great, right?

320
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:58,123
Scott: So What these guys are reenacting is all the battles that went on in secret wars.

321
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,450
Rym: So now this is obviously not real.

322
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:04,123
Rym: This is obviously some kids making a funny thing like a fear of girls.

323
00:23:04,303 --> 00:23:05,166
Scott: Yes, exactly.

324
00:23:05,246 --> 00:23:05,828
Scott: That's what it is.

325
00:23:06,411 --> 00:23:13,950
Scott: But it's also hilarious, especially, you know There are a few jokes like even they're actually some obscure characters and they're like Kang.

326
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:25,949
Scott: Kang is like one of the best dudes in Marvel Comics and no one even knows about Kang You know and it's the one guys dressed up as Kang and I think someone says to him something to him and he's like Kang doesn't blah blah blah.

327
00:23:27,471 --> 00:23:28,315
Scott: It's pretty hilarious.

328
00:23:28,979 --> 00:23:31,009
Scott: and the little kid with the Wolverine is pretty funny, too.

329
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:36,125
Scott: Yeah, I want the guy trying to pick up the frisbee with the thing or Hulk hands the Hulk hands.

330
00:23:36,386 --> 00:23:37,811
Scott: Yeah, that was good, too The mr.

331
00:23:37,831 --> 00:23:39,457
Scott: Fantastic guys kind of weird.

332
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,470
Scott: and then there's like the spider-man guy who doesn't know what he's doing.

333
00:23:44,971 --> 00:23:49,309
Rym: Yeah, yeah the Doc Ock trying to wiggle his hips to hit the guy with his Doc Ock things.

334
00:23:50,211 --> 00:23:51,274
Scott: Yeah, just just watch it.

335
00:23:51,355 --> 00:23:52,037
Scott: It's pretty funny.

336
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:55,448
Rym: Yeah, it's definitely not as good as fear of girls, but it's up there.

337
00:23:55,829 --> 00:23:58,008
Scott: Yep It's just another one of those things like that.

338
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:00,696
Scott: And it's appropriate cuz it's comic day.

339
00:24:00,836 --> 00:24:02,923
Rym: people should not be afraid of cookie.

340
00:24:03,384 --> 00:24:05,170
Rym: cookie should be afraid of people.

341
00:24:05,572 --> 00:24:07,347
Scott: Cookie should be afraid of stomach acid.

342
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:15,027
Rym: Yeah, all right, so we went to target.

343
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:15,569
Scott: wait a minute.

344
00:24:16,573 --> 00:24:22,270
Scott: You know like there are people who believe that you know some magical God created them and they pray to that God.

345
00:24:22,431 --> 00:24:24,849
Scott: Do cookies pray to grandma for baking them?

346
00:24:26,376 --> 00:24:27,270
Rym: So we went to target.

347
00:24:30,153 --> 00:24:32,782
Rym: We went to Torah con this year this past weekend.

348
00:24:33,464 --> 00:24:48,057
Rym: for those of you who only listen to anime day I suggest that you listen to the Monday episode this week Because we played on that episode our live panel from Torah con 2006 because that panel was largely about Podcasting and not about anime.

349
00:24:48,097 --> 00:24:51,009
Scott: We played it on Monday, even though we did it at an anime convention.

350
00:24:51,933 --> 00:24:56,073
Rym: Now Torah con is not a terribly widely known convention because this was its 2.5 one.

351
00:24:58,511 --> 00:24:59,534
Scott: Yeah, something like that.

352
00:24:59,735 --> 00:25:03,246
Rym: Yeah, basically way way back when I was president of the RIT anime club.

353
00:25:03,267 --> 00:25:12,530
Rym: I Tried to Fiat threw a spring cosplay and it went All right, not that many people showed up But actually we had a really good promotional thing and there was a good event.

354
00:25:12,572 --> 00:25:12,904
Rym: It was fun.

355
00:25:13,792 --> 00:25:20,869
Rym: The next year after I graduated the next president of the anime club decided that they would go one step further and turn this into an actual one-day convention.

356
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:32,089
Rym: hooray now Everyone in our crew the entire front row crew with the exception of Scott Drove out to torque on 2005 last year and had a ride his time.

357
00:25:32,551 --> 00:25:36,850
Rym: Yeah, now the funny thing is none of us expected torque on to be big or anything.

358
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,901
Rym: We expected basically the same kind of events.

359
00:25:38,921 --> 00:25:40,329
Rym: The club has always thrown just a little thing.

360
00:25:41,391 --> 00:25:43,337
Rym: We got there and there were.

361
00:25:43,478 --> 00:25:47,470
Rym: there was a huge crazy crowd and a line out the door and it was fantastic.

362
00:25:47,651 --> 00:25:49,950
Rym: For the first year of a con it was just amazing.

363
00:25:51,271 --> 00:25:56,186
Rym: So we came back this year this time as both of us guests and did a panel.

364
00:25:56,607 --> 00:25:59,578
Scott: Hooray Let's do a little crap.

365
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:04,837
Scott: so driving up there was Somewhat unpleasant with the rain.

366
00:26:04,857 --> 00:26:08,650
Rym: Yeah, basically Rochester it rains there always.

367
00:26:09,113 --> 00:26:11,250
Scott: Well, no, the sky is always gray there.

368
00:26:11,853 --> 00:26:20,010
Scott: It just happened to be that when we were entering with as we got closer to Rochester It rained more and then when we finally left Rochester the rains started to subside.

369
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:26,155
Rym: Yeah, plus we drove up real late Because you know people.

370
00:26:26,837 --> 00:26:30,410
Rym: yeah, yeah, but we got there and it was weird.

371
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:33,539
Rym: this was the first time where we visited Rochester place.

372
00:26:33,579 --> 00:26:40,120
Rym: we lived for some four or five years going to school and Instead of crashing on someone's floor or doing the thing.

373
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:46,728
Scott: We always do we stayed in a hotel room Which is good because I could freakin sleep on a bed not on a floor.

374
00:26:46,748 --> 00:26:48,996
Rym: Yeah Shower is key.

375
00:26:49,238 --> 00:26:59,521
Rym: I mean no offense to our friends in college and Especially since our shower is just as bad but no one in Rochester at least at RIT has a shower that I can deal with anymore.

376
00:26:59,802 --> 00:27:01,607
Scott: No, no, no, damn.

377
00:27:01,627 --> 00:27:05,749
Scott: I Mean either they have low pressure or it's dirty.

378
00:27:06,311 --> 00:27:07,636
Rym: Dirty is the primary.

379
00:27:07,676 --> 00:27:17,070
Rym: this stuff in there one of our friends their bathroom in their in their apartment And RIT is so bad with mildew and mold that I if I walk in my eyes start watering.

380
00:27:17,911 --> 00:27:20,124
Rym: Wow, I pee in there with my eyes closed.

381
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:28,682
Rym: Oh my god All right Yeah, but anyway, we you know stay in the hotel room crazy time and then in the morning we woke up and we went to Torricon.

382
00:27:29,831 --> 00:27:35,089
Rym: It wasn't much bigger than last year, but that doesn't really mean anything bad because that means it was still really big.

383
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:39,287
Scott: Yeah, it didn't seem very crowded, you know, yeah

384
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:43,166
Rym: But that also could be due to the fact that it used more rooms this year,

385
00:27:43,186 --> 00:27:43,669
Scott: uh-huh

386
00:27:45,471 --> 00:27:52,614
Rym: Now I will say that the primary thing we did at Torricon was actually sit in a big circle in various rooms throughout the con Playing DS games

387
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:53,557
Scott: mostly Tetris.

388
00:27:53,617 --> 00:27:54,862
Rym: Yeah Tetris is great.

389
00:27:55,003 --> 00:28:01,095
Scott: Yeah, you're gonna call this Tetris con Instead of Torricon, it would have been just as accurate But I got to say it's.

390
00:28:01,516 --> 00:28:05,390
Rym: I realized that I'm kind of addicted to going to conventions as a guest.

391
00:28:06,155 --> 00:28:08,230
Rym: Like it's different from going to a convention normally.

392
00:28:08,971 --> 00:28:12,001
Rym: I'm not used to going to a con and here's my money.

393
00:28:12,061 --> 00:28:14,449
Rym: Give me a badge because for so long it's been.

394
00:28:14,469 --> 00:28:16,575
Rym: hey I'm Rym and oh, it's Rym.

395
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:16,976
Rym: All right.

396
00:28:17,036 --> 00:28:20,184
Rym: Here's your special magic badge that says something slightly different.

397
00:28:20,224 --> 00:28:22,330
Rym: that makes you 1% cooler than nobody.

398
00:28:23,492 --> 00:28:26,210
Rym: All right, so it was real nice to get in as a guest.

399
00:28:28,133 --> 00:28:29,603
Scott: It just meant I didn't have to pay though.

400
00:28:29,643 --> 00:28:30,550
Scott: It was a 12 bucks.

401
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:32,983
Rym: Yeah, it was a decent bit of money quite a bit more than last year.

402
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:35,334
Scott: Yeah the 12 bucks I think you know.

403
00:28:35,354 --> 00:28:45,730
Scott: while in the grand scheme 12 bucks is like nothing like if any con charge 12 bucks They're like sure 12 bucks is less than what we paid each for our dinner at Torricon.

404
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:54,790
Scott: Yeah, but at the same time considering the Torricon is so small and you're not really, you know I don't think you really get 12 bucks worth.

405
00:28:56,071 --> 00:29:09,310
Scott: Get like 10 bucks worth maybe eight, you know, so while 12 isn't like exorbitantly overpriced It's it's like a tiny bit much and it some a lot of poor otaku types felt a little uncomfortable and I could see why.

406
00:29:09,853 --> 00:29:12,249
Rym: Yeah, well part of that was due to confusion at RIT.

407
00:29:12,531 --> 00:29:17,185
Scott: Oh, yeah, some people thought it was 20 because some the SG listed it is 20 when it wasn't.

408
00:29:17,386 --> 00:29:18,550
Scott: yeah, that was a mess-up.

409
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,795
Scott: Yeah, that's not cool.

410
00:29:19,795 --> 00:29:20,759
Scott: 20 would have been outrageous.

411
00:29:20,819 --> 00:29:22,184
Scott: But you know 12 is.

412
00:29:22,325 --> 00:29:31,370
Scott: it was, you know near the limit Yeah, but I think it was fair considering that they had pine am do a concert Yeah, but then they charge you two bucks extra if you wanted a pine am ticket.

413
00:29:31,671 --> 00:29:36,370
Rym: I heard that that was because they got pine am at the last minute after they'd already set the prices.

414
00:29:36,872 --> 00:29:37,153
Scott: Uh-huh.

415
00:29:37,474 --> 00:29:39,983
Rym: I don't know for sure since I'm not on their board or anything.

416
00:29:40,424 --> 00:29:44,546
Scott: as a matter two bucks is basically nothing Yeah, and they didn't charge for anything else besides that.

417
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:49,190
Rym: Yeah Well, I think they'd like if you did the metal works panel you had to pay a little bit for your stuff.

418
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:54,390
Scott: Well, no, I think what happened because we were the metal works panel was right before ours and I heard them talking.

419
00:29:54,491 --> 00:29:56,091
Rym: Well, it was listed as $3.

420
00:29:56,091 --> 00:30:03,743
Scott: it was listed as three dollars, but it seemed like the metal works guys are the ones collecting that money because It was only paying for their materials and such.

421
00:30:03,924 --> 00:30:09,470
Scott: Yeah, and Those guys really didn't seem to care if the people didn't pay they just thought it was nice if you paid.

422
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:13,370
Rym: Yeah, they really didn't seem to want to get out of our panel room and it was time for us to record our show.

423
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:25,986
Scott: Yeah, and I heard a story later just to hearsay that they didn't want to get out of the their the room later when they Had a panel again because they had two panels, but whatever what workshops technically.

424
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:30,450
Rym: Yeah, but anyway I mean, it's not a big con but it's a one-day thing and it's it's very fun.

425
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,574
Rym: I think it's fairly well-run.

426
00:30:31,594 --> 00:30:32,015
Rym: Mm-hmm.

427
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:36,230
Rym: I mean basically, you know, we got there and we saw all of our old friends again.

428
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,134
Rym: It was a huge get-together.

429
00:30:37,174 --> 00:30:38,320
Rym: We couldn't walk five feet without.

430
00:30:38,621 --> 00:30:40,610
Rym: Hey, it's Rym and Scott in the front row crew.

431
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,537
Scott: Oh There's a person I haven't seen.

432
00:30:43,557 --> 00:30:44,765
Scott: Oh, there's a person I haven't seen you.

433
00:30:44,785 --> 00:30:45,147
Scott: There's a prison.

434
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:45,549
Scott: I've been seen.

435
00:30:46,071 --> 00:30:48,137
Rym: Yeah, we saw some people with people I have seen.

436
00:30:48,157 --> 00:30:54,455
Rym: yeah, basically everyone was there with a few exceptions, but they all had good excuses Mm-hmm, except Ian.

437
00:30:55,118 --> 00:30:55,499
Scott: Yeah.

438
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,744
Scott: Yeah his story is.

439
00:30:57,246 --> 00:31:01,447
Scott: I don't think you listen to this So you should tell him to listen to this one, I think I did once.

440
00:31:01,467 --> 00:31:03,495
Scott: I don't know What he's doing.

441
00:31:04,018 --> 00:31:11,593
Rym: Yeah, but I mean they had a panel on web comics Which was funny because one we knew all the webcomic people on the panel and two None of them.

442
00:31:11,734 --> 00:31:15,130
Rym: really well I was one except they don't really update their comics so much anymore.

443
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,404
Scott: Yeah, I'm kind of.

444
00:31:18,572 --> 00:31:23,370
Scott: Their panel was actually a pretty good panel like and it was mildly entertaining all things considered.

445
00:31:23,932 --> 00:31:28,750
Scott: But at the same time I'm kind of phased, you know, every con has a freaking web comics panel.

446
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,295
Scott: I just don't see the point of it anymore.

447
00:31:30,476 --> 00:31:30,677
Scott: Yeah.

448
00:31:30,717 --> 00:31:34,450
Rym: Well, it'd be like if we still do a podcasting panel two years from now.

449
00:31:35,092 --> 00:31:38,123
Scott: Yeah, it's like if you're gonna have a panel at a con.

450
00:31:38,183 --> 00:31:39,970
Scott: sure you can make pretty much any panel.

451
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:40,894
Scott: I could make a panel.

452
00:31:40,995 --> 00:31:44,929
Scott: you can pick a random topic and I can make it entertaining, you know That's not the point.

453
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:49,290
Scott: The point is if you have a panel at a con there should be a purpose to that.

454
00:31:49,411 --> 00:31:50,576
Scott: I feel there should be a purpose.

455
00:31:50,597 --> 00:31:50,858
Scott: Yeah.

456
00:31:50,999 --> 00:31:55,576
Rym: Well to me I see two basic kinds of panels Informative and entertaining.

457
00:31:55,596 --> 00:31:56,118
Rym: Mm-hmm.

458
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:58,970
Rym: And as long as you're one of the two, I don't really care what the panel is about.

459
00:31:59,412 --> 00:32:01,965
Rym: I mean with what the panel went to at Otakon last year.

460
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:04,435
Rym: Mike Pfeffer's thing on Politics and anime.

461
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:05,177
Scott: that was informative.

462
00:32:05,418 --> 00:32:05,619
Scott: Yes.

463
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:06,602
Rym: It was also entertaining.

464
00:32:06,983 --> 00:32:07,224
Scott: Yeah.

465
00:32:07,385 --> 00:32:09,572
Scott: Well, that's cuz he's so cool Yep.

466
00:32:09,874 --> 00:32:12,626
Rym: Now we did a panel at Tora con that was very informative.

467
00:32:12,666 --> 00:32:14,861
Rym: It was here is Podcasting and how it works.

468
00:32:15,124 --> 00:32:15,286
Rym: Mm-hmm.

469
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:19,724
Rym: Now if we do this again, we'll probably be a lot less informative and a lot more entertaining.

470
00:32:20,787 --> 00:32:21,690
Rym: and the webcomic panel.

471
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:25,465
Rym: It was very entertaining but there's really nothing left to be said about web comics.

472
00:32:25,866 --> 00:32:28,015
Rym: every web comics panel Everyone asked the same questions.

473
00:32:28,457 --> 00:32:29,200
Rym: How do you do it?

474
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:30,646
Rym: How long does it take to do it?

475
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:31,730
Rym: Why did you start?

476
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:33,334
Rym: What comics do you read?

477
00:32:33,936 --> 00:32:37,870
Scott: Yeah, it's like I don't you know, that's the part of it that I don't see the point of anymore.

478
00:32:37,951 --> 00:32:46,354
Scott: you might as well just have a You know don't call it a web comics panel because it's kind of dumb to have web comics panels ever call it like You know.

479
00:32:46,857 --> 00:32:47,260
Scott: panel.

480
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,772
Scott: meet webcomic artists you know.

481
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:54,305
Scott: or webcomic artists chat or call it something different and you know.

482
00:32:54,806 --> 00:33:07,966
Scott: bill it as an Entertaining talk with webcomic artists and not as the web comics panel where everyone talks about webcomics Yep, which luckily that's what the three webcomic artists did in their panel here at Otakon at Tora Con.

483
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:20,690
Scott: Well, that's the other thing is that even if you bill a web comics panel as talking about web comics Webcomic artists have talked about that stuff so much on panels a thousand times and there's nothing left to be said.

484
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:26,282
Scott: So they end up just having to do what I said They should do anyway, which is just be entertaining and have a fun time.

485
00:33:26,443 --> 00:33:28,130
Rym: Yep, which to me is the best kind of panel?

486
00:33:28,552 --> 00:33:38,561
Scott: Yeah, I mean the worst kind of panels the ones where guys just sit there go Yeah Nothing hat or even they don't do anything and they don't show up.

487
00:33:38,661 --> 00:33:40,890
Rym: or hey people not showing up for a panel is great.

488
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:43,005
Rym: That's how I got my start in this whole panel business.

489
00:33:43,368 --> 00:33:49,324
Scott: Yeah But there's also industry panels which I don't go to but they have a purpose to like.

490
00:33:49,364 --> 00:33:51,370
Scott: those are quote real panels.

491
00:33:52,132 --> 00:34:01,469
Scott: Yeah, you know where they have like announcements to make Guests to like question and announce things and that sort of shit.

492
00:34:02,914 --> 00:34:03,889
Scott: That's a real panel.

493
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:06,300
Rym: But overall that panel is really fun.

494
00:34:06,581 --> 00:34:08,750
Rym: The panel we ran actually was very fun, too.

495
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,447
Rym: We had a decent crowd and they seem to like us.

496
00:34:11,293 --> 00:34:14,429
Rym: Yeah, you heard that on Monday, yep, you can hear him cheering in the background.

497
00:34:17,411 --> 00:34:23,389
Scott: The dealing at the con was done mostly in the main lobby and There really wasn't anything for me to buy at all.

498
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:27,226
Scott: I think the best thing I saw was like a bank that was shaped like a question block.

499
00:34:27,688 --> 00:34:30,422
Rym: Yeah I mean, I guess for me, I'm just jaded to dealers rooms.

500
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:32,150
Rym: I buy almost nothing at cons anymore.

501
00:34:32,511 --> 00:34:35,463
Scott: Yeah, well the thing with dealers rooms is like originally.

502
00:34:35,664 --> 00:34:41,022
Scott: it was like that There was stuff there that you'd never seen before but you really wanted you like.

503
00:34:41,263 --> 00:34:43,370
Scott: Oh my god amazing imported goods from Japan.

504
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:44,176
Scott: I must have them all.

505
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:45,525
Rym: yep capsule toys capsule toys.

506
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:46,029
Scott: Oh my god.

507
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:50,103
Scott: Yeah, but once you get them all or you get enough of them, it's like, okay.

508
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,087
Scott: What do you have?

509
00:34:51,107 --> 00:34:51,748
Scott: That's new.

510
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:56,250
Scott: Do you have you know this new Mario diorama thing?

511
00:34:56,630 --> 00:35:00,364
Scott: Do you have this new plushie from this brand new anime that everyone's into?

512
00:35:00,384 --> 00:35:02,252
Scott: and if you don't have anything new It's like.

513
00:35:02,292 --> 00:35:03,439
Scott: I've seen all this stuff before.

514
00:35:03,459 --> 00:35:04,727
Scott: I already know I don't want it.

515
00:35:05,592 --> 00:35:12,456
Rym: Yeah, I've gotten to the point where I go to a dealers room and I want like one or two specific things and I just Walk around looking for those things.

516
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:16,550
Scott: Yeah, the first two Otakons I went to where the dealers room is tremendous.

517
00:35:16,711 --> 00:35:21,890
Scott: You know, you see everything and you've already know your brain has already said I don't want that and I do want this.

518
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:26,970
Scott: It's like if you go to a video game store and then you go to the same video game store the next day.

519
00:35:27,612 --> 00:35:37,189
Scott: You already know the parts of the store that have stuff and what's generally there and that you don't want it and you go right to the place that has the stuff that you might want the new releases or whatever.

520
00:35:37,209 --> 00:35:40,035
Scott: and That's what dealers rooms turned into.

521
00:35:40,076 --> 00:35:44,390
Scott: is you gloss over everything you've seen and you go right for the new stuff and then you're done.

522
00:35:44,651 --> 00:35:53,396
Scott: Yeah, but at least the unique stuff that I may not be new, but I didn't realize existed Yeah, that's another thing is like I don't want to spend too much time in the dealer room because it could be a waste of Time.

523
00:35:53,437 --> 00:35:53,908
Scott: it's a risk.

524
00:35:54,291 --> 00:36:02,647
Scott: but at the same time you can tell the interesting dealers when they start to have like Weird things that don't look conventional

525
00:36:02,808 --> 00:36:03,070
Rym: like first

526
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:08,095
Scott: I get down and I start rooting through all of it to find you know Like the rare hot piece

527
00:36:08,516 --> 00:36:11,948
Rym: like you see the dealer that has DVDs at basically retail prices.

528
00:36:12,028 --> 00:36:12,450
Rym: ignore him.

529
00:36:12,832 --> 00:36:14,986
Rym: You see the other dealer with the exact same setup.

530
00:36:15,046 --> 00:36:15,529
Rym: ignore him.

531
00:36:16,131 --> 00:36:21,067
Rym: You see the dealer that has all the $40 Japanese CDs and $100 art books.

532
00:36:21,468 --> 00:36:33,545
Rym: you ignore him and then you find the one that has like the cool weird bin of crap or discount manga for a dollar or Crazy imported weird thing that you've never seen in the US before.

533
00:36:33,585 --> 00:36:34,369
Rym: look at this thing

534
00:36:35,172 --> 00:36:46,329
Scott: You can always tell like there was a one dealer at Otakon last year where the the booth was set up weird with like these White racks and like there were things hanging from overhead and everything like that and it was real crowded to walk around.

535
00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:46,650
Scott: the booth.

536
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:50,110
Scott: Wasn't the best booth design in terms of crowd control?

537
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:53,950
Rym: Well, it might have been due to the fact that I don't think he expected to quite the crowd at his booth.

538
00:36:54,292 --> 00:37:05,979
Scott: yeah, but everything in that booth was like You know, it was mostly imported mangas and art books and things that you'd never seen before because you know the major importers like Kino Kuni.

539
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:11,318
Scott: you don't get that stuff because not stuff you get in bulk and It wasn't stuff that was ever translated here.

540
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:12,784
Scott: See then you start looking around.

541
00:37:12,804 --> 00:37:14,350
Scott: you find all this weird stuff.

542
00:37:14,671 --> 00:37:20,010
Scott: It's not really, you know outlandish, but it's stuff you've never seen before in your life didn't know it existed.

543
00:37:20,411 --> 00:37:29,010
Scott: So then you start to look through every single item the guy has and every single weird, you know He doesn't have things organized so well with everything in the same place.

544
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:35,393
Scott: So I'll have like a pin like hanging up on the side of a little white rack and you like oh, you know And those are the.

545
00:37:35,454 --> 00:37:36,919
Scott: that's the dealers you spend time in.

546
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:37,320
Rym: Yep.

547
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:38,665
Rym: That's actually how I got my.

548
00:37:38,766 --> 00:37:39,890
Rym: it's one of my favorite little bits.

549
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:42,110
Rym: It's a con badge holder.

550
00:37:42,912 --> 00:37:49,470
Rym: It exists solely to hold convention badges as far as I can tell and it's a really cool little piece of I guess jewelry.

551
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:56,179
Rym: And I just found it by itself hanging from actually the ceiling of one Guys booth at Katsucon last year.

552
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:56,259
Rym: Hmm.

553
00:37:57,102 --> 00:37:59,150
Scott: It's all about the nooks and crannies, you know.

554
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:05,990
Scott: So when you have a little dealers room like the one at Tora con There really aren't so many nooks and crannies and you see pretty much everything.

555
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:08,863
Scott: They've got from 10 feet away and you don't need to.

556
00:38:09,345 --> 00:38:10,390
Scott: you know deal a lot.

557
00:38:10,672 --> 00:38:12,709
Rym: But at the same time they seem to be doing brisk business.

558
00:38:13,631 --> 00:38:16,239
Scott: Yeah, yeah, I think you know a lot of people.

559
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:31,342
Scott: they're probably never been to a con or you know Their first Tora con at least and the dealers didn't seem like they were super used to dealing You know at many big conventions, so no, what do you expect?

560
00:38:31,503 --> 00:38:31,663
Scott: Yep.

561
00:38:32,305 --> 00:38:33,469
Rym: I mean it is a small convention.

562
00:38:33,489 --> 00:38:35,505
Rym: still though I do think it's gonna grow in time.

563
00:38:35,525 --> 00:38:42,869
Scott: Hmm So, let's see the head of video game room, which I didn't spend more than also five minutes in Yeah, but it was definitely spacious which is key.

564
00:38:43,606 --> 00:38:57,650
Scott: Yeah It was good that it was spacious and give give people a lot of room to move around and breathe and all that spectate but at the same time it didn't seem like they had too many games going on and They're you know, they had the shitty small TVs.

565
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:08,929
Rym: well for chairs the fact because I mean I used to do all this if the fact that they had so few TVs leads me To believe that the TVs were allocated elsewhere by RIT and they had fewer TVs than they wanted I'm pretty sure that's the case.

566
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:16,489
Rym: But you know though to me the only failing of the video game room is that they should have Encouraged and set up something to do with a Nintendo DS.

567
00:39:17,651 --> 00:39:26,460
Rym: Yeah, every con I've been to since the DS came out has been just a flood of DS's and you'll see whole groups of people Just sitting down all over the place playing DS games wirelessly.

568
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,488
Scott: I didn't see too many DS's other than ours though.

569
00:39:28,509 --> 00:39:36,977
Rym: It's weird Yeah, but I mean I've been to RIT during anime club meetings recently and yeah 30 or 40 DS's all whipped out.

570
00:39:37,198 --> 00:39:37,378
Rym: Hmm.

571
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:41,493
Rym: So yeah, maybe because people there I mean, it's RIT It's a campus.

572
00:39:41,533 --> 00:39:43,061
Rym: Everyone's playing DS games all the time.

573
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:44,990
Rym: So when they go to a con they want to do con stuff.

574
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:49,490
Scott: Yeah, plus there were with three tournaments and none of them were really exciting.

575
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:53,390
Scott: They should have had at least one fun tournament like a Mario Tennis or something.

576
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:55,056
Rym: Well, I guess I don't think they had.

577
00:39:55,297 --> 00:39:57,928
Rym: I don't know why but they didn't run any big tournaments.

578
00:39:58,169 --> 00:40:01,490
Scott: Yeah Oh, well, the artist's alley was pretty good.

579
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:05,972
Scott: The only thing that you know, it could have been bigger, but I think they had it just right for the room They put it in.

580
00:40:06,274 --> 00:40:09,850
Rym: Yep, because there aren't so many rooms they can use in the building that they have the con in.

581
00:40:10,292 --> 00:40:13,827
Rym: So that was pretty much the only room they could put that in unless it got really really big.

582
00:40:14,088 --> 00:40:17,219
Rym: Yeah But I mean the art there was typical of artist's alleys.

583
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:17,701
Rym: It was good.

584
00:40:17,821 --> 00:40:19,970
Rym: We had some friends in there who have awesome art.

585
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:20,432
Rym: Mm-hmm.

586
00:40:21,015 --> 00:40:23,830
Scott: There were some people in there with not so awesome art, but that's how artist's alleys go.

587
00:40:24,611 --> 00:40:26,618
Scott: You know, not everyone's super amazing.

588
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:29,788
Scott: Oh my god art, you know, if everyone is super amazing.

589
00:40:29,808 --> 00:40:33,907
Scott: Oh my god art There wouldn't be any crap art and then the super amazing wouldn't be super amazing and etc.

590
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:41,628
Rym: Now, of course true to its roots the main thing about ToraCon I mean basically up until the cosplay.

591
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:46,249
Rym: ToraCon is basically just getting people to hang out long enough for the cosplay to start.

592
00:40:47,371 --> 00:40:48,135
Rym: Toric I mean start.

593
00:40:48,175 --> 00:40:57,599
Rym: there was a. it started as a cosplay and then it became a con But it was centered around the cosplay and now it's becoming a real con bit by bit like a big con But it's definitely still.

594
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,585
Rym: the cosplay is like.

595
00:40:58,645 --> 00:40:59,450
Rym: this is the main event.

596
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:08,190
Scott: Well, it seems like a lot of conventions the cosplay is the main event, you know Even when you go to Otakon you can totally ignore the cosplay and get a crazy con.

597
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:11,229
Scott: They oh the cosplay is still crazy huge.

598
00:41:11,631 --> 00:41:19,541
Scott: Yep, even when they have a main event like a concert with a real band The cosplay is like perhaps bigger or if not equal.

599
00:41:19,701 --> 00:41:20,142
Rym: Yep, though.

600
00:41:20,183 --> 00:41:21,045
Rym: Definitely ToraCon.

601
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:22,830
Rym: Nothing was scheduled opposite the cosplay.

602
00:41:23,151 --> 00:41:28,110
Rym: So, I mean there were things going on during the day, but pretty much it was after the cosplay started.

603
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:33,844
Rym: it was cosplay and the concert and The dance and nothing overlapped anything.

604
00:41:33,884 --> 00:41:37,415
Rym: from that point on Cool seem to work fairly.

605
00:41:37,455 --> 00:41:39,563
Rym: Well, there was definitely time to get dinner which was good.

606
00:41:39,924 --> 00:41:41,390
Scott: Yeah the cosplay itself.

607
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:43,339
Scott: I went to some of the skits.

608
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:47,340
Scott: I think there were two skits that were real funny and good Yeah, the Legend of Zelda skit.

609
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:57,182
Scott: that one was actually really good Yeah, and some of there were a few really good costumes there too like surprisingly But at the same time it didn't have a whole.

610
00:41:57,202 --> 00:41:59,071
Scott: the quantity wasn't there, you know It was.

611
00:41:59,192 --> 00:42:02,210
Rym: it was over pretty quickly like, you know what that made me very happy.

612
00:42:02,531 --> 00:42:12,965
Rym: I I like watching cosplays because a lot of times it'll you'll see the diamond in the rough the awesome sketch or that the awesome Costume, but I can't waste two hours of my time at Otakon.

613
00:42:13,427 --> 00:42:18,905
Scott: Yeah at Otakon We've made a habit of just kind of moseying into the you know spillover.

614
00:42:19,166 --> 00:42:20,370
Scott: Yeah the spillover room.

615
00:42:20,632 --> 00:42:26,721
Scott: They always have a spillover room even though they you know Even if the regular cosplay room doesn't fill up.

616
00:42:26,822 --> 00:42:38,133
Scott: They always have the cosplay like Video casted in another room live and it's always so much better to go there cuz not crowded and you can see better and It's just great.

617
00:42:38,815 --> 00:42:43,729
Scott: Yep, and they usually in that same room show the really good movies late on Saturday night.

618
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:51,698
Rym: Yeah, yep But I mean the cosplay toricon was short and it was pretty good and I really enjoyed it and the fact that it was short Was very key and me enjoying it.

619
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,810
Scott: Yeah, that's the one thing that's wrong about.

620
00:42:54,392 --> 00:42:58,766
Scott: You know bigger cons is that the cause any cosplay is 90% crap 10% awesome.

621
00:43:00,712 --> 00:43:06,830
Scott: So the shorter it is the less time you spend crap and you still get the same amount of awesome.

622
00:43:07,473 --> 00:43:14,549
Rym: Though the one main thing about the cosplay at toricon that I like is that last year I was actually cosplay judge and this year I was not but I did other things instead.

623
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:19,849
Rym: The cosplay was actually run very professionally and very well by the people who were in charge of it.

624
00:43:20,672 --> 00:43:31,530
Rym: They had a sort of crisis where the person who was in charge of the cosplay was for various reasons He left the board and was no longer in charge of the cosplay right before the con.

625
00:43:32,472 --> 00:43:36,890
Rym: So someone else was forced to take his place and run the whole cosplay basically on almost no notice.

626
00:43:37,391 --> 00:43:42,968
Rym: Yeah, and considering that they did a pretty good job even not considering that that was an extremely well-run cosplay.

627
00:43:42,988 --> 00:43:44,735
Rym: Yeah I mean even Otakon.

628
00:43:44,776 --> 00:43:47,066
Rym: they have a lot of trouble running the cosplay smoothly.

629
00:43:47,086 --> 00:43:50,290
Scott: Mm-hmm Yeah, they're always like oh who's on next who's right, you know.

630
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:52,589
Scott: The only time they messed up I think at this one was they had.

631
00:43:53,092 --> 00:43:56,246
Scott: They seemed like they had a piece of paper for every skit and cosplayer.

632
00:43:56,286 --> 00:44:01,110
Scott: Yeah, that's how you do it Yeah, and I think they lost one of the pieces of paper and that was the worst thing that happened.

633
00:44:01,471 --> 00:44:02,795
Rym: Yeah, I mean it was really well done.

634
00:44:02,815 --> 00:44:04,319
Rym: Like I was actually really impressed.

635
00:44:04,861 --> 00:44:06,586
Scott: Yeah had the shit together all good.

636
00:44:07,268 --> 00:44:10,724
Rym: now after that We got dinner and then there was the concert pine.

637
00:44:10,864 --> 00:44:20,330
Scott: and yeah I had heard of pine am like I knew it was the name of a Japanese band of girls who made music And then I knew they were no Otakon and I didn't see them.

638
00:44:20,471 --> 00:44:23,970
Scott: I think I saw them from far away, but didn't actually listen to the music or anything.

639
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:26,781
Rym: Yeah, I'd been told of their music, but I hadn't actually heard it and it was.

640
00:44:26,821 --> 00:44:38,422
Rym: it was described to me by someone as Almost electric electro pop but almost techno but not really Yeah, and with cute Japanese girls and that didn't really explain anything to me.

641
00:44:38,502 --> 00:44:43,317
Scott: No, I didn't so considering you know, that was like The biggest thing going on at Tora con.

642
00:44:43,357 --> 00:44:46,890
Scott: we paid our two bucks and we went to see it and it was pretty good.

643
00:44:47,252 --> 00:44:48,640
Rym: Yeah, I there there.

644
00:44:48,741 --> 00:44:50,330
Rym: two of the three band members were there.

645
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:53,405
Rym: They put on I'd say a really good set in an actual real auditorium.

646
00:44:53,425 --> 00:45:04,337
Rym: Mm-hmm He the crowd was a little sedated first, which might have surprised them but then a bunch of people ran up to the front and then I ran up to the front and then everyone ran up to The front ever started dancing and screaming.

647
00:45:04,357 --> 00:45:08,010
Scott: Yeah, I would have run up to the front to like I wanted to but I food.

648
00:45:08,532 --> 00:45:12,150
Scott: Well, there was the Thai food and the the hours and hours of driving and I was like, you know what?

649
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:13,255
Scott: I haven't sat down all day.

650
00:45:13,275 --> 00:45:14,400
Scott: I can see it.

651
00:45:15,184 --> 00:45:16,430
Rym: Yeah, I ran straight up to the front.

652
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:19,947
Rym: I was literally about three feet away from the the singers.

653
00:45:20,449 --> 00:45:24,369
Rym: Yep It was a. it was a really good concert and they seemed to really get into it.

654
00:45:24,794 --> 00:45:31,709
Rym: in fact after the concert They set up a little table right outside and they signed pretty much as many autographs as people were there who wanted them.

655
00:45:32,693 --> 00:45:36,649
Scott: It doesn't seem like they're that crazy popular in Japan or the US.

656
00:45:36,709 --> 00:45:39,176
Scott: so You know, they're sort of like.

657
00:45:39,317 --> 00:45:43,570
Scott: they're not an independent, you know garage band, but they're like one step above that.

658
00:45:44,052 --> 00:45:47,144
Rym: They definitely don't make enough money however to keep themselves going.

659
00:45:47,666 --> 00:45:48,570
Scott: Oh, yeah, that's for sure.

660
00:45:48,751 --> 00:45:50,669
Scott: I mean if you have any success at all.

661
00:45:51,212 --> 00:45:54,224
Scott: It's like with a record company with being a musical artist.

662
00:45:54,324 --> 00:46:00,750
Scott: if you're in it with a record company There's like this line and when once you're below the line you're in trouble, but as soon as you cross the line, it's great.

663
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:14,102
Scott: Especially, you know, if you're actually musically talented you do all sorts of other things besides just your band, you know You do all sorts of other musical things to make money also Yep, and I got to say I do really like their music now that I've heard it.

664
00:46:14,604 --> 00:46:18,899
Scott: Yeah, it wasn't the worst music It wasn't the best music, but it was decent.

665
00:46:18,939 --> 00:46:20,103
Scott: It wasn't painful to listen to.

666
00:46:20,123 --> 00:46:30,027
Scott: you know, I was pretty much just Groovin, I wouldn't download it and listen to it my car But I wouldn't mind listening to it if someone else popped it into a CD player, whatever.

667
00:46:30,389 --> 00:46:32,676
Rym: Yeah I'll probably acquire an album at some point.

668
00:46:33,158 --> 00:46:36,909
Rym: Yeah, but that's I mean the two singers were actually really cool.

669
00:46:37,916 --> 00:46:44,510
Scott: Yeah, it seemed like they were much Like the people themselves were much cooler than at least my opinion of their music.

670
00:46:45,271 --> 00:46:47,821
Scott: It's like someone is so cool and then they make decent music.

671
00:46:48,323 --> 00:46:49,487
Scott: That's not as cool as they are.

672
00:46:49,548 --> 00:46:53,425
Rym: But okay No, the crowd seemed to love them and I don't know.

673
00:46:53,505 --> 00:46:54,610
Rym: Maybe they'll be back next year.

674
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:56,278
Rym: I don't know what'll happen to next Tora con.

675
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:58,168
Scott: Yeah, they'll have to do something.

676
00:46:58,268 --> 00:47:00,850
Rym: Who knows I mean this was the torque on first musical guest.

677
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:03,585
Rym: I think it was a really good pick because it was like it was a good band.

678
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:09,905
Rym: It was a good show and It's actually really it's kind of rare for a small con to get a not up.

679
00:47:09,985 --> 00:47:15,949
Rym: not it's not definitely not a big name But a sizable good band for as little money and resources as they had.

680
00:47:16,572 --> 00:47:19,462
Scott: Usually if you have a tiny con like this, you're lucky to get.

681
00:47:19,783 --> 00:47:21,630
Rym: you're lucky to get like industry person.

682
00:47:21,811 --> 00:47:25,990
Rym: You're lucky to get like the one guy in town who kind of knows how to play a Final Fantasy song on his guitar.

683
00:47:26,172 --> 00:47:28,129
Scott: You're lucky if you get piano squall.

684
00:47:28,993 --> 00:47:32,065
Scott: Or you're lucky if you get like one guy from a TV to show up.

685
00:47:32,366 --> 00:47:34,353
Rym: anyone can get piano squall You just have to pay.

686
00:47:34,373 --> 00:47:35,056
Rym: Yeah.

687
00:47:35,177 --> 00:47:35,498
Scott: Yeah.

688
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:37,326
Scott: Well, he doesn't Oda Khan doesn't pay him.

689
00:47:37,707 --> 00:47:40,658
Scott: Yeah But he does that one for free.

690
00:47:40,698 --> 00:47:41,684
Scott: That's his advertising.

691
00:47:42,126 --> 00:47:47,850
Scott: But the point is The fact that you get like a real band at a little tiny con.

692
00:47:48,931 --> 00:47:49,573
Scott: It's just huge.

693
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:53,208
Rym: Yeah, like I'm really props to them for doing that plus the.

694
00:47:53,268 --> 00:47:53,690
Rym: they took it.

695
00:47:53,831 --> 00:47:55,290
Rym: I don't know if they took the suggestion from us.

696
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:58,320
Rym: I think it's just the natural progression of things in a con.

697
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:01,190
Rym: but this year they had a dance slash rave after the concert.

698
00:48:01,533 --> 00:48:03,490
Scott: You kind of need one of those in any con nowadays.

699
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:12,063
Rym: Well last year when we went after the cosplay and impromptu dance slash rave Started all on its own in the cosplay room afterwards.

700
00:48:12,324 --> 00:48:13,770
Scott: How did you just get a boombox?

701
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,013
Rym: Well, we're in the.

702
00:48:15,053 --> 00:48:21,114
Rym: they were in the web auditorium and someone just put a CD on and everyone just stuck around and danced until We basically got kicked out.

703
00:48:21,134 --> 00:48:21,776
Rym: Uh-huh.

704
00:48:22,177 --> 00:48:25,850
Rym: So this year they actually got a real DJ who was mixing vinyl out there.

705
00:48:26,552 --> 00:48:33,409
Rym: And while I'm not the hugest fan of you know, straight-up house mixing with vinyl I just I'm not that interested in that kind of music.

706
00:48:34,513 --> 00:48:36,390
Rym: The guy was really good like the DJ.

707
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:40,269
Rym: I forget his name, but he was really good at what he did and I think he put on a good show.

708
00:48:40,831 --> 00:48:41,192
Scott: Yeah, like.

709
00:48:41,253 --> 00:48:53,058
Scott: I'm not really a fan of like being in the dance club while they're playing the dumb dumb dumb Technos, but I actually kind of like listening to good Electronic music just listening.

710
00:48:53,461 --> 00:48:55,513
Rym: Yeah, you know, I like dancing to it But I don't like.

711
00:48:55,533 --> 00:48:58,410
Rym: I don't usually like dancing to the stuff that people in clubs tend to play.

712
00:48:58,691 --> 00:49:01,984
Rym: Yeah, because the people in clubs in the US don't tend to play the type of techno I like.

713
00:49:02,305 --> 00:49:06,469
Scott: but listening to this guy You know through the walls because you can hear it from anywhere nearby.

714
00:49:07,251 --> 00:49:12,074
Scott: Some of the at least the parts that I was listening to in his music were like, yeah, it's a good techno All right.

715
00:49:12,194 --> 00:49:14,566
Rym: Yeah, and people were for the most part actually dancing.

716
00:49:15,189 --> 00:49:21,580
Rym: Yeah I mean I was a little disappointed that he didn't play more anime related stuff But I mean, that's me and that's the kind of dance music I like.

717
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:26,509
Rym: but the fact that despite that he played music That was good enough for me to go dance to it was good.

718
00:49:27,591 --> 00:49:36,469
Scott: Yeah, if I would have if I would have been in the mood to get up to the front at the pine am concert I probably would have spent some time in the rave instead of just poking my head in and not poking it.

719
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:39,990
Rym: Yeah, again, though while I poked my head in I'll say that the sound system was good.

720
00:49:41,491 --> 00:49:46,150
Rym: The music was you know, like if we said good there was very little funk which made me very happy.

721
00:49:47,191 --> 00:49:53,818
Scott: Yeah, I didn't think there was really funk anywhere in the con so much Like I didn't have a bad smell at all.

722
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:57,070
Scott: and when we were at the little tiny video game con there was smell.

723
00:49:57,291 --> 00:50:01,809
Scott: Yeah, that one Oh God aiming for hope how to smell and not toricon not at all.

724
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:06,342
Rym: Yeah, especially considering it was kind of humid and kind of hot all weekend.

725
00:50:06,443 --> 00:50:07,987
Scott: Did you there wasn't any DDR?

726
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:08,970
Scott: toricon was there?

727
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:12,058
Rym: I wouldn't be surprised if that was a conscious decision.

728
00:50:12,339 --> 00:50:14,607
Scott: Maybe I think was there a guitar hero.

729
00:50:14,667 --> 00:50:15,450
Scott: I didn't see that either.

730
00:50:16,137 --> 00:50:26,142
Rym: No, actually now that I think about it No, they didn't have any of that as far as I could tell but last year the video gaming was all in the fireside lounge Which is this huge huge huge room this year.

731
00:50:26,202 --> 00:50:28,350
Rym: They didn't have that room for the whole con.

732
00:50:28,471 --> 00:50:30,169
Rym: I think that threw a kink in all their plans.

733
00:50:30,581 --> 00:50:33,298
Scott: Yeah someone else was using that room for part of the time.

734
00:50:33,338 --> 00:50:40,943
Rym: they were pissed those other people because there's a giant dance party and all These crazy anime people running around and they're having some sort of like award ceremony thing.

735
00:50:40,983 --> 00:50:43,010
Scott: It's sort of banquet pageant thing.

736
00:50:43,392 --> 00:50:44,056
Scott: Yeah, it was great.

737
00:50:44,116 --> 00:50:50,324
Scott: But before they took that room over I think the They used it for the music video showing.

738
00:50:50,344 --> 00:50:53,339
Rym: Yep, which we did I forgot to talk about but it was actually.

739
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:54,484
Rym: I mean, it wasn't great.

740
00:50:54,644 --> 00:50:59,428
Rym: We played Tetris during it Yeah, but we stood up and watched, you know bits of all the videos to get a feel for it.

741
00:51:00,751 --> 00:51:04,130
Rym: Most cons these days have really crappy anime music video contests.

742
00:51:04,211 --> 00:51:05,037
Rym: I'm not even gonna lie.

743
00:51:05,097 --> 00:51:06,750
Rym: most cons just the AMV is that are coming.

744
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:11,550
Scott: Well, there's nothing to do with the cons has to do with the fact that people making music video these days are just terrible.

745
00:51:11,774 --> 00:51:13,659
Scott: Yeah back in the day It was hard to do so.

746
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:18,002
Scott: people wouldn't do it unless they were gonna put in a whole lot of effort to make something really good.

747
00:51:18,383 --> 00:51:20,110
Scott: and it sort of went on this curve of.

748
00:51:20,572 --> 00:51:23,909
Scott: Okay, some people put in a lot of effort to make something really great.

749
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:25,614
Scott: The technology got better.

750
00:51:25,915 --> 00:51:28,262
Scott: people kept as a technology made it easier.

751
00:51:28,302 --> 00:51:32,035
Scott: people kept doing a better and better job and making better and better Music videos.

752
00:51:32,438 --> 00:51:34,169
Scott: then the technology made it too easy.

753
00:51:34,613 --> 00:51:37,050
Scott: So now people don't make as good music videos.

754
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:38,134
Scott: It's so easy to make them.

755
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:42,590
Rym: now some people still do but they're just harder to find or harder to sift out through all the crap.

756
00:51:42,912 --> 00:51:44,984
Scott: Yeah, or they just keep it to themselves.

757
00:51:45,024 --> 00:51:45,406
Scott: a lot of them.

758
00:51:45,426 --> 00:51:46,030
Scott: They're kind of scary.

759
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:52,729
Rym: So bearing that in mind that our opinion is we're fairly elitist when it comes to AMVs and we were very kind of.

760
00:51:52,749 --> 00:51:53,653
Scott: well It's all relative.

761
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:59,110
Scott: Like if I'd never seen an AMV before and I had seen the ones shown at ToraCon I would have been like holy crap.

762
00:51:59,151 --> 00:51:59,399
Rym: Yeah.

763
00:51:59,951 --> 00:52:07,030
Scott: But seeing is that your music video has to compete with all the anime music videos I've seen in the past.

764
00:52:07,211 --> 00:52:09,358
Scott: Yeah, you got you're up against a tough bunch.

765
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:12,610
Rym: Yeah, I mean the mama Leo hit me baby one more time.

766
00:52:13,153 --> 00:52:16,510
Scott: It's sort of unfair because when you think about it, you look at something like sports.

767
00:52:16,932 --> 00:52:24,118
Scott: Right, the Mets team playing right now in baseball doesn't have to compete with Previous baseball teams.

768
00:52:24,138 --> 00:52:26,510
Scott: They only have to compete with the ones that exist right now.

769
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:31,344
Scott: But you know seeing is that music videos aren't sports.

770
00:52:31,906 --> 00:52:36,004
Scott: you make something now You have to compete with everything that ever existed.

771
00:52:36,246 --> 00:52:37,110
Scott: It's really hard to win.

772
00:52:37,471 --> 00:52:41,024
Rym: Like you might have the best idea for an Evangelion music video ever like.

773
00:52:41,065 --> 00:52:46,130
Rym: seriously your idea is awesome And you were an awesome person, but there are so many Ava music videos.

774
00:52:46,471 --> 00:52:49,381
Rym: Don't even bother because there's no way anyone will even notice it.

775
00:52:49,621 --> 00:52:50,725
Scott: I mean look at the f1 race.

776
00:52:50,785 --> 00:52:55,010
Scott: He just watched, you know Alonzo is doing really really well.

777
00:52:55,071 --> 00:53:06,174
Scott: He didn't win the most recent race But if anyone had to compete with not Michael Schumacher now But Michael Schumacher of five years ago in his better car you couldn't win It.

778
00:53:06,194 --> 00:53:07,059
Scott: just that's how it is.

779
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,790
Rym: Yeah, so bear all that in mind.

780
00:53:08,878 --> 00:53:12,990
Rym: I mean I can't say the AMVs were great because a very few AMVs are great to me anymore.

781
00:53:13,532 --> 00:53:16,241
Rym: The AMVs were typical of big good conventions.

782
00:53:16,301 --> 00:53:18,710
Rym: Like it was the kind of AMV contest I'd expect from an Otakon.

783
00:53:19,052 --> 00:53:22,854
Scott: Yeah, I think there were two sappy one two or three sappy ones I wasn't interested in.

784
00:53:22,874 --> 00:53:25,403
Rym: there were the typical whole bunch of fighting scene ones.

785
00:53:25,564 --> 00:53:27,150
Scott: Yeah, the ones with a whole bunch of fighting scenes.

786
00:53:28,952 --> 00:53:33,683
Scott: There was one that could have been a little better Where the action scenes didn't really match the music.

787
00:53:33,763 --> 00:53:41,530
Scott: because if you're gonna do the action Music video, you know, what you have to do is you have to match the beats of the music to the action.

788
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:43,577
Scott: That's what makes those things cool to watch.

789
00:53:43,817 --> 00:53:47,810
Scott: Yeah, like if you don't get it right on it's like, uh, you know what?

790
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:53,950
Rym: Let's do a whole show on AMVs Because we could actually go point-for-point examples like this.

791
00:53:54,131 --> 00:53:57,850
Scott: This is one of the categories and this is how to make a good video in those categories.

792
00:53:58,031 --> 00:54:04,700
Rym: Yeah, I think cuz we're really kind of like connoisseur slash snobs when it comes to the sort of thing kind of Comes to a lot of things.

793
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:05,264
Scott: Yeah, we are.

794
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:06,070
Scott: That's the point of this.

795
00:54:06,238 --> 00:54:06,347
Rym: Yeah.

796
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:10,925
Rym: So while I said the AMV is a torque on weren't great take that with the grain of.

797
00:54:10,945 --> 00:54:15,121
Rym: we are elitist bastard salt Because it was a really good AMV contest.

798
00:54:15,182 --> 00:54:16,950
Rym: Like I really given props for pulling that off.

799
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:22,226
Scott: There was that one video that was actually like five as among Adil videos attached to that was.

800
00:54:22,346 --> 00:54:23,670
Rym: that was cheating in my opinion.

801
00:54:24,053 --> 00:54:26,010
Scott: I also counted as cheating.

802
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:31,947
Scott: But if you separate it into five separate videos, like it should have been the first one was a was really good.

803
00:54:32,309 --> 00:54:32,690
Rym: Yeah, it was.

804
00:54:34,135 --> 00:54:34,701
Scott: Yeah, that's about it.

805
00:54:35,288 --> 00:54:42,115
Rym: Yep And I mean overall torque on was a great time and anyone who lives anywhere near the Rochester area I highly recommend you check it out.

806
00:54:42,236 --> 00:54:43,078
Rym: It's super cheap.

807
00:54:43,158 --> 00:54:44,261
Rym: It's only one day.

808
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:47,450
Rym: if you need a hotel hotels in Rochester cost nothing.

809
00:54:48,112 --> 00:54:55,969
Scott: Yeah, it seemed like a lot of the hotels really close were either expensive or full But we found one a short ways away for nothing.

810
00:54:56,271 --> 00:55:02,938
Rym: I think the reason most of the hotels I looked at were sold out was due to the fact that I waited until three days Before we left to get the hotel room.

811
00:55:03,279 --> 00:55:05,327
Scott: Yeah with Otakon you have to get a year in advance.

812
00:55:05,347 --> 00:55:09,268
Scott: with Tora Khan I think a couple months in advance is it would be okay, but not three days.

813
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:09,690
Scott: three days.

814
00:55:09,771 --> 00:55:11,530
Scott: This isn't okay for anywhere at any time.

815
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:16,210
Scott: Yeah, except for like on the highway where you get off and you stop at any hotel you want.

816
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:21,050
Rym: Yeah, but I mean really if you live anywhere near Rochester definitely check out Tora Khan.

817
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:23,015
Rym: It's really fun and it's growing.

818
00:55:23,035 --> 00:55:34,629
Rym: Uh, I don't want to commit to anything, but I would wager within four or five more years It's gonna be one of the not be like huge cons not a mega con like an Otakon But I think it'll be one of the bigger cons.

819
00:55:35,551 --> 00:55:36,174
Scott: Maybe we'll see.

820
00:55:36,194 --> 00:55:39,329
Rym: Yeah, I could see it even moving into Rochester and out of RIT.

821
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:41,622
Scott: Well, we'll see.

822
00:55:42,028 --> 00:55:44,894
Rym: Yep Now I guess we'll wrap up this episode With.

823
00:55:45,396 --> 00:55:55,261
Rym: I didn't do a lot of interviews at the con for various reasons Mostly because I was busy doing other things and I wasn't too worried about Interviewing people since we recorded a whole hour of us doing a panel

824
00:55:55,562 --> 00:55:58,312
Scott: and we didn't really have a lot of interesting things to ask People.

825
00:55:58,513 --> 00:56:07,910
Rym: yeah, I mean when we go to Otakon, I'm gonna one we're gonna interview people about Otakon But two I'm gonna interview people about anime and have a whole separate set of interviews for like another show sometime.

826
00:56:08,352 --> 00:56:13,590
Scott: Yeah, we actually you know cuz just going in with a little thing in a record II bit doesn't really work.

827
00:56:14,031 --> 00:56:20,878
Scott: I think we had to take a cue from the anime world order guy who actually had a plan for what he was gonna ask People in his search for the truth.

828
00:56:21,159 --> 00:56:21,320
Rym: Yep.

829
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,790
Rym: Well, my plan for toricon was very specifically.

830
00:56:24,011 --> 00:56:26,967
Rym: I just want to get a cross-section of what people at the con thought of the con.

831
00:56:27,108 --> 00:56:30,559
Rym: Mm-hmm So I didn't really ask any particularly the hard-hitting questions.

832
00:56:30,739 --> 00:56:31,662
Rym: Yeah, maybe none of that.

833
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:32,083
Rym: None of that.

834
00:56:32,424 --> 00:56:34,290
Rym: Why are you dressed up as a blah-blah-blah?

835
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:38,323
Scott: Yeah, maybe an Otakon we should do like a search for the lies.

836
00:56:38,524 --> 00:56:42,189
Scott: Oh speaking of anime world order I don't want to forget to say this for yet another week.

837
00:56:43,053 --> 00:56:45,703
Scott: We did an episode a while ago about Lupin the third.

838
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,389
Rym: Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.

839
00:56:48,112 --> 00:56:57,564
Rym: Yeah, we did this show on Lupin the third mostly because we were tired and it's easy to talk about Lupin because we love it And they sent us an email that was very informative and awesome.

840
00:56:57,584 --> 00:57:11,890
Scott: Oh Yes, after we did our Lupin the third episode the anime world order people who knows so much more about anime than we do Sent us a little email with all the mistakes we made in that episode.

841
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:21,210
Scott: I'm not gonna read the whole thing because it's not worth my time or yours But let me just tell you the interesting tidbits of things we messed up about Lupin.

842
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:23,254
Rym: Yeah, at least we were dead on about Zenigata.

843
00:57:23,795 --> 00:57:25,278
Scott: We were dead on about Zenigata.

844
00:57:25,298 --> 00:57:26,040
Scott: So forget about him.

845
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:34,089
Scott: Apparently we said something like the first series of Lupin like that was all you you said.

846
00:57:34,129 --> 00:57:35,873
Scott: yeah Because I did.

847
00:57:35,933 --> 00:57:47,138
Scott: I watched like the first episode of the original Lupin series and it was really kind of 70s and corny and kitschy and all that sort of thing And the second series wasn't just kind of corny and silly.

848
00:57:47,779 --> 00:57:50,827
Scott: it was silly in the Lupin that I know that's my Lupin.

849
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:56,058
Scott: Yeah, but The first series got canceled after 23 episodes.

850
00:57:56,199 --> 00:58:00,350
Scott: And of course, actually I just downloaded all those 23 episodes today.

851
00:58:01,296 --> 00:58:05,234
Scott: Some of those episodes are by Miyazaki Which is interesting.

852
00:58:05,675 --> 00:58:07,540
Rym: Yeah, so Scott got booed.

853
00:58:07,721 --> 00:58:11,156
Scott: Yeah, so I'm gonna have to go watch those and we'll we'll get back to you on that one.

854
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:16,129
Scott: Apparently jigen his name.

855
00:58:17,051 --> 00:58:17,994
Scott: That's not his real name.

856
00:58:18,014 --> 00:58:20,041
Scott: He's not actually a Japanese, dude.

857
00:58:20,182 --> 00:58:22,510
Rym: Yeah, I remember hearing that he was like half Japanese or something.

858
00:58:22,771 --> 00:58:30,419
Scott: No, he's like, uh, he's like a Chicago mafia dude who ran away Or something like that, they don't no one actually really knows.

859
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:33,749
Rym: yeah, I mean the Lupin movie the live-action.

860
00:58:33,889 --> 00:58:38,726
Rym: one Supposes or puts forth a history, but I don't know if that movie is actually canon.

861
00:58:38,987 --> 00:58:44,382
Scott: Mm-hmm Goa Mon was actually not in the manga for a long time.

862
00:58:44,442 --> 00:58:53,390
Scott: Like he wasn't even in Lupin at all and He started out in the manga as an assassin that someone hired to kill Lupin and then he just kind of stuck around.

863
00:58:53,952 --> 00:58:55,076
Rym: I'm very happy about that.

864
00:58:55,096 --> 00:58:55,276
Rym: Now.
