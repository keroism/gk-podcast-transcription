1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,347
Scott: It's Wednesday, November 28th.

2
00:00:11,808 --> 00:00:12,390
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,611 --> 00:00:18,739
Scott: I'm Rym and this is GeekNights tonight Full metal Alchemist, which I hope you didn't do a show on before.

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:30,990
Rym: Let's do this You know for as much as I like anime.

5
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:36,408
Rym: It's kind of sad that I really haven't had the time to watch any in like the last two weeks.

6
00:00:36,528 --> 00:00:44,110
Scott: Well, look at me I got four Unbeaten Wii games sitting on the Wii I got just I just got a DS game.

7
00:00:44,351 --> 00:00:47,089
Rym: I stopped playing worms just long enough to do the show.

8
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:47,431
Rym: Yeah,

9
00:00:47,752 --> 00:01:00,781
Scott: the the pile of comics that I got early in the month has I mean, I've been eating away at it But it's actually grown some because I traded comics with some people like I've rid of stuff that I'm never gonna read again And they sent me stuff that was actually really good.

10
00:01:00,862 --> 00:01:01,425
Scott: So and

11
00:01:01,485 --> 00:01:10,890
Rym: I thought I was done I thought I was gonna start catching up and then a friend of mine lent me some Chiyo Saito manga that I'll talk about once I read the rest of it, which is gonna take a while

12
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:15,301
Scott: Yeah, but it's like I got these anime I want to watch.

13
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:21,917
Scott: I've downloaded the fan subs or I'm waiting for them on Netflix or who knows and It's just not gonna add next year.

14
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:25,690
Scott: I think when the new year rolls around there will be a resurgence of anime watching.

15
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,626
Rym: Yeah, I mean weren't we watching Gundam double-o and baka?

16
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:33,466
Scott: No Yep, all those things by the time we get around to watching they'll be on Netflix.

17
00:01:33,506 --> 00:01:34,350
Scott: that will delete all the fans.

18
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,002
Rym: All right, we never even finished Nana.

19
00:01:37,042 --> 00:01:38,047
Rym: We got right up to her.

20
00:01:38,168 --> 00:01:41,424
Scott: Oh, man Is that gonna be on DVD or what I assume?

21
00:01:41,464 --> 00:01:42,609
Scott: so it must be right.

22
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:45,962
Rym: I haven't been paying attention to be honest me either right.

23
00:01:46,042 --> 00:01:47,227
Rym: So, uh, what do you got for me?

24
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:50,421
Scott: All right There's no anime news and I'm also.

25
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:51,446
Scott: I'm no anime news.

26
00:01:51,506 --> 00:01:52,189
Rym: What about odex?

27
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,293
Scott: Whatever.

28
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,680
Scott: I'm tired of just doing news from anime news network.

29
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,943
Scott: So, oh great.

30
00:01:58,244 --> 00:02:01,453
Rym: So you're never gonna talk about anime news again Pretty much.

31
00:02:01,634 --> 00:02:03,700
Scott: Um, so I'm gonna do a geek bite.

32
00:02:04,061 --> 00:02:08,895
Scott: a geek bite on this manga that I read in that giant pile of comics I was talking about now.

33
00:02:09,035 --> 00:02:25,730
Scott: This manga is called once upon a glash ma GL a SH Ma and if you read in the back of the book where sort of like, you know The funny extra section is they sort of talk about where the title came from and it's like one of the editors.

34
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:32,006
Scott: I think it says here Glass shoes and magic is is glass ma.

35
00:02:32,408 --> 00:02:39,070
Scott: Yeah Once upon a glass from us, so it's sort of like this fairy tale title once upon a magic glass, right?

36
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,777
Scott: So I bought this manga.

37
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:41,219
Scott: It's all.

38
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:43,550
Scott: it's a one volume manga from a TV manga.

39
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,399
Scott: It's the whole thing as far as I can tell.

40
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,464
Scott: it's not volume one.

41
00:02:46,524 --> 00:02:49,662
Scott: It's the whole thing For two reasons.

42
00:02:49,723 --> 00:02:55,024
Scott: number one It was originally published in newtype and then I think also a newtype USA.

43
00:02:55,084 --> 00:02:59,017
Scott: and you know those manga that are published in new Newtype are usually you know, not bad.

44
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:06,810
Scott: and the person who did the manga is Kumiko sue kane Which is the person who did the Phoenix Wright character designs if I am correct.

45
00:03:08,332 --> 00:03:11,366
Scott: So I said well, I like them Phoenix Wright character designs.

46
00:03:11,787 --> 00:03:12,370
Scott: I'll buy it.

47
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,750
Scott: It's only one volume now and it was good enough to be a new type.

48
00:03:15,951 --> 00:03:23,990
Rym: That is a dangerous preposition because we all know that Liking character designs does not follow for liking a show in many cases.

49
00:03:24,792 --> 00:03:28,182
Scott: But you know, I mean this thing the cover price is 1095.

50
00:03:28,182 --> 00:03:31,110
Scott: I paid like seven or eight, you know, not a bad deal.

51
00:03:31,394 --> 00:03:40,653
Scott: Oh, no so this manga Not good It's just.

52
00:03:40,693 --> 00:03:41,516
Scott: it's not bad.

53
00:03:41,577 --> 00:03:43,303
Scott: It's not like oh, this is painful.

54
00:03:43,384 --> 00:03:44,187
Scott: Oh, this is terrible.

55
00:03:44,227 --> 00:03:44,970
Scott: I don't want to read this.

56
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:45,955
Rym: You know what?

57
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,020
Rym: I'm gonna talk about now.

58
00:03:47,623 --> 00:03:55,502
Scott: Basically what this is about is there's a world and For some reason is no more women in the world.

59
00:03:55,522 --> 00:04:04,270
Scott: There's only guys, right and Because for some reason no one knows guys are just getting magic powers sort of randomly.

60
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,302
Rym: But how do they know that girls aren't also getting magic?

61
00:04:07,362 --> 00:04:09,410
Rym: There are no girls aren't any girls left?

62
00:04:09,755 --> 00:04:10,508
Rym: You can't say that.

63
00:04:10,831 --> 00:04:12,677
Rym: Well guys only are getting magic.

64
00:04:12,757 --> 00:04:18,113
Scott: the magic power the the increase of the number of with male wizards started.

65
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:33,549
Scott: it coincided with the Complete disappearance of all females, uh-huh right, so you have these characters who work for sort of like the Government bureaucratic agency that sort of you know keeps track of.

66
00:04:33,609 --> 00:04:45,250
Scott: you know Who has magic powers and what magic powers they have and how dangerous they are Uh-huh, and of course they end up having to deal with like people turning into dragons or you know people turning other people into women.

67
00:04:46,651 --> 00:04:48,137
Rym: But I thought there were no women.

68
00:04:48,157 --> 00:04:51,009
Rym: so what if I turn someone else into a woman do they immediately become a man?

69
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:51,190
Rym: what?

70
00:04:51,831 --> 00:04:56,406
Scott: No, yeah, the the it's not like there's some magic force keeping women away.

71
00:04:56,466 --> 00:05:01,377
Rym: It's just all the women disappeared Suddenly, so just make a bunch more women.

72
00:05:01,437 --> 00:05:02,099
Rym: We're good to go.

73
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:04,807
Scott: You know, they got to make women without women not easy.

74
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,650
Rym: Ah Okay, we have at least one friend in our lives who got a sex change.

75
00:05:09,992 --> 00:05:15,659
Rym: Imagine there are enough people in this world, but yeah But I want to become women that the magic will allow it to happen.

76
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:19,650
Scott: a sex change doesn't make you reproductive, but it's magic.

77
00:05:22,152 --> 00:05:37,563
Scott: The magic in this book there isn't a whole lot of controllable magic like there's actually one really cool character Who's like he's a big tough, dude But he's afraid of his boss who isn't big who his boss is not big and scary But like his power is turning invisible, but he can't.

78
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:38,667
Scott: he doesn't like control.

79
00:05:38,747 --> 00:05:40,574
Scott: it like does sometimes But not really.

80
00:05:40,634 --> 00:05:44,350
Scott: mostly he turns invisible when he's afraid like sort of uncontrollably.

81
00:05:45,151 --> 00:05:46,337
Scott: It's magic sort of like that.

82
00:05:46,357 --> 00:05:49,753
Scott: Not not like we're all Merlin the Great here you know, it's like.

83
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:55,672
Scott: everyone has specific power and some people don't have a power like the main character right and It.

84
00:05:55,752 --> 00:06:04,725
Scott: there's a few chapters and then in the course of this entire one volume You know, they reveal all sorts of stuff and then they solve the problem of where all the women went.

85
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:20,167
Scott: Oh spoiler, whatever and It's just sort of shallow and silly and it's got a lot of parts that are Fan service II and painful and anime cliche of every kind you can imagine.

86
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:26,303
Rym: and all right Scott Yeah in the spirit of what zero punctuation did today who would like this?

87
00:06:26,403 --> 00:06:28,248
Rym: Who would this be recommended to to?

88
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,978
Rym: Improperly form a sentence as who would like this.

89
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,483
Scott: I think it definitely would.

90
00:06:33,543 --> 00:06:39,902
Rym: are you gonna take the roundabout way of Defining an audience such that you have both insulted the audience and the work simultaneously.

91
00:06:39,922 --> 00:06:51,809
Scott: I don't know because I actually think that you know the the cliche Stereotypical American fangirl would like this and they would think it was kind of cool.

92
00:06:52,372 --> 00:06:53,837
Scott: It wouldn't be like their favorite thing ever.

93
00:06:54,018 --> 00:06:59,678
Scott: I mean, it's someone's favorite thing ever, but I think the typical Stereotypical fangirl and the u.s.

94
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:00,642
Scott: Would enjoy this.

95
00:07:00,743 --> 00:07:08,493
Rym: so it's not cute funny Stereotypical shallow like say dragon half which is one of my favorite shows Dragon half.

96
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:10,441
Scott: it is enjoyed by the typical fan boy.

97
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:23,166
Rym: I Just remember being so embarrassed when I had to convince my mom to go to the store and buy dragon half for me Because it said you've got to be 17 to watch this and I wasn't really sure why.

98
00:07:23,186 --> 00:07:24,510
Rym: then I found out why.

99
00:07:25,092 --> 00:07:29,110
Scott: Yeah, someone who like enjoys, you know, like the cliches of anime, you know.

100
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:39,147
Scott: Like if you like a love Hina, even though this is not a harem thing in any way But it you know has a lot of those same stereotypes that all those sort of you know anime have.

101
00:07:39,428 --> 00:07:43,600
Rym: oh my god He looked at me punch in the face nosebleed sweat drop.

102
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,906
Scott: Like if you like the Auron this probably.

103
00:07:45,926 --> 00:07:47,390
Scott: hey Auron's awesome.

104
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,085
Scott: Yeah, this isn't as good as the Auron but you know, it's the same.

105
00:07:50,347 --> 00:07:52,665
Scott: if you like it You'll probably like this for similar reasons.

106
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:55,176
Rym: I guess How much of Auron have you seen?

107
00:07:55,196 --> 00:07:57,826
Scott: Yeah a few up two episodes.

108
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:58,569
Scott: I don't know.

109
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,710
Scott: It's the only thing I know that feels similar to this at all.

110
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:09,930
Scott: If anyone wants my coffee I'll be glad to trade you or sell it to you or something cuz I don't need it anymore.

111
00:08:11,352 --> 00:08:12,738
Scott: It's in my get rid of file.

112
00:08:12,898 --> 00:08:14,264
Scott: So yeah, right.

113
00:08:14,305 --> 00:08:17,374
Rym: so I What's the name of it again?

114
00:08:17,394 --> 00:08:21,890
Rym: Since someone pointed out that whenever we go by we should probably upon a glass muzz.

115
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:29,774
Scott: GLA sh ma by kumiko sue kane from a TV manga and I think if you get new type USA It was him.

116
00:08:29,794 --> 00:08:31,040
Scott: You must have read it already, right?

117
00:08:31,321 --> 00:08:33,190
Scott: If you if you're I don't know, right?

118
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,888
Rym: So I'm going to tell you a tale of whoa.

119
00:08:36,871 --> 00:08:52,250
Rym: You see back when Scott and myself and the rest of the front row crew were still in college living at RIT in the middle of the wilderness surrounded by snow and ice Locked into our little set of buildings connected by tunnels trying desperately to avoid ever having to go to class or go outside.

120
00:08:53,311 --> 00:08:59,694
Rym: We would often sit around the computer looking for cool things and one day we found this teaser Wasn't even a trailer.

121
00:09:00,035 --> 00:09:07,556
Rym: It was a teaser for some Japanese movie and we were into the Foreign movies we've been going to.

122
00:09:07,576 --> 00:09:25,750
Rym: the video barn which had the video bar is probably the best video rental place Ever at least in Rochester, you know, you can go there like you'd see a title and you pull it out And it just says on the front some name in Japanese But then in marker under that the owner has written very good sword fighting.

123
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:31,748
Scott: Alright this place still rents VHS's and they've got like every movie ever period and like literally.

124
00:09:31,808 --> 00:09:34,130
Scott: this is how you know The video barn is the best video rental place.

125
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:44,010
Scott: I walk in and I say, you know, we my friend friend Scott Johnson had seen On the internet, you know, some randomly some movie called attack the gas station, right?

126
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,368
Scott: which we've talked about before on the show and on movies you should see.

127
00:09:47,388 --> 00:09:52,010
Scott: and So we go to the video barn and we're like, do you have attack the gas station?

128
00:09:52,211 --> 00:09:57,129
Scott: The guy just reaches behind him and puts the DVD on the counter and then he says you're really gonna like this.

129
00:09:57,491 --> 00:10:01,690
Scott: Yeah, the video barn blockbuster, you know can suck video barns dick.

130
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,823
Rym: I mean the fact that I could walk in there and be like and the guy knew us.

131
00:10:04,863 --> 00:10:08,898
Rym: cuz we came like every week and I'd be like, I don't know what I should watch.

132
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:10,944
Rym: and he'd say you want funny or violent.

133
00:10:11,586 --> 00:10:12,972
Rym: I'd say a Violent.

134
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:13,776
Rym: he'd say watch this.

135
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:14,983
Scott: Yeah.

136
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:17,181
Rym: Oh, those were good days Good days.

137
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:23,593
Rym: our Problem wasn't getting access to these movies because we could see pretty much any weird movie We wanted.

138
00:10:23,974 --> 00:10:31,130
Rym: the problem was knowing which ones to get because even if we got recommendations He'd recommend pretty much everything in the store, which was usually accurate.

139
00:10:31,852 --> 00:10:43,889
Rym: So we saw this teaser and it appeared from what we had seen to be the greatest movie ever made It qualifying that by saying if you were us in college

140
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:51,490
Scott: Yeah, if you're us in college and you look at this trailer for this movie Immediately all I could think was wow, that's gonna be the best movie ever.

141
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:57,550
Rym: It was the the music and what was going on in this teaser not trailer because I'll talk about that later.

142
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:09,408
Rym: But this teaser which I can't find anymore It had airships and technology and robots and it and it looked really serious explosions and awesomeness and a lot of scenes of like politicians yelling at each other.

143
00:11:09,448 --> 00:11:09,729
Rym: and it was.

144
00:11:09,749 --> 00:11:22,777
Rym: I Was so there and we looked forward to this movie look forward to this movie and we just kept watching the internet waiting for this movie to come out and we all kept watching the trailer and over and over again like check this out this is gonna be the best thing ever.

145
00:11:22,797 --> 00:11:28,663
Rym: and Then at some point cash earn came out.

146
00:11:29,446 --> 00:11:38,689
Rym: we saw it Not enough now independent of the fact that it was that it was hyped up to us mostly by us Say I'd seen it in a vacuum.

147
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:45,878
Rym: It was perhaps The worst movie I've ever seen Definitely one of the worst movies of our team.

148
00:11:45,898 --> 00:11:53,003
Scott: and I would say even if it's not the absolute worst movie I've ever seen it is the most time.

149
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,750
Scott: I've wasted watching a movie.

150
00:11:55,171 --> 00:11:58,461
Scott: It was the most pain I felt while watching the movie.

151
00:11:58,542 --> 00:12:01,170
Rym: It was almost as bad as Clifford with Martin short.

152
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:02,436
Rym: It was awful.

153
00:12:02,818 --> 00:12:02,959
Rym: Now.

154
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:07,728
Scott: It's terrible very bad very very bad.

155
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:14,568
Rym: But worse than that was that say my expectation was zero and that movie was you know negative 100 out of it.

156
00:12:15,552 --> 00:12:15,793
Scott: It's not.

157
00:12:15,853 --> 00:12:19,710
Scott: and the thing about it is it's not bad like a Fist of the North Star where you can laugh at it.

158
00:12:19,811 --> 00:12:20,900
Scott: It's it's just bad.

159
00:12:20,961 --> 00:12:25,419
Rym: It's bad like For all the explosions I saw in that trailer.

160
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:27,325
Scott: where the fuck were they in that movie?

161
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:29,754
Scott: all at the end, but all What.

162
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:33,330
Rym: why didn't the trailer show me the stupid costumes everyone was wearing?

163
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,660
Rym: Why didn't the trailer show me that no one see?

164
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,006
Rym: the trailer wasn't even in English.

165
00:12:37,046 --> 00:12:37,910
Rym: We didn't have subtitles.

166
00:12:38,032 --> 00:12:44,224
Rym: So we just said oh, man Seeing if the trailer had shown me in any way what those people were actually saying.

167
00:12:44,304 --> 00:12:45,709
Rym: I probably would have known better.

168
00:12:46,852 --> 00:12:48,350
Scott: It definitely would have known better.

169
00:12:48,611 --> 00:12:54,912
Rym: But the worst thing is my expectation wasn't zero and I got negative 100. my expectation was 90.

170
00:12:54,912 --> 00:12:59,246
Rym: So I had I had an expectation deficit of a hundred and ninety on this movie.

171
00:12:59,647 --> 00:13:00,410
Rym: Fuck this movie.

172
00:13:01,153 --> 00:13:04,610
Scott: I think the other problem with the movie is that they called it cuss Hearn, right?

173
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:12,274
Scott: Which is ca SS H e RN if we were more intelligent as we are now Right and more and less and more aware of things.

174
00:13:12,755 --> 00:13:22,440
Scott: We would have realized at the time which we did not that it was related to kassan The the robot hunter which I've also seen written kass Hearn.

175
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,578
Rym: But I didn't know that because I'd seen.

176
00:13:24,598 --> 00:13:31,021
Scott: I didn't think I didn't make the connection between Cassern and kassan until after seeing the terrible movie.

177
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,468
Rym: I made the connection when I saw that stupid helmet.

178
00:13:33,528 --> 00:13:36,912
Rym: I was like, oh Oh This.

179
00:13:37,193 --> 00:13:45,444
Rym: oh, it's that because I saw kassan robot hunter on the sci-fi channel a long time ago And I liked it because I was in fourth grade.

180
00:13:45,464 --> 00:13:48,207
Rym: I Don't like it anymore.

181
00:13:49,311 --> 00:13:53,370
Scott: Actually, well, no, you know what's on robot hunter the anime I can like in an ironic way.

182
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:58,910
Rym: Well, I think that there's also like the TV show but let me put it this way the the anime and the TV show.

183
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:00,877
Rym: I liked it when I was in fourth grade.

184
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:04,069
Rym: I didn't like it when I was in high school and learn better.

185
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:12,775
Rym: I like it again But only because of respect for old-school kind of style and aesthetic and as a result my thing of the day Which I'll get to.

186
00:14:12,856 --> 00:14:24,315
Rym: but yeah, so The I would rather watch kassan robot hunter in English a thousand times then even watch the trailer to this Goddamn movie again.

187
00:14:24,335 --> 00:14:25,940
Scott: Yeah, we tried to find the.

188
00:14:26,181 --> 00:14:29,894
Scott: the teaser that you know made us think the movie was awesome So that you could see.

189
00:14:29,915 --> 00:14:32,970
Scott: you know why we thought the movie was awesome, even though it sucks.

190
00:14:33,311 --> 00:14:37,689
Scott: But all we could find was the trailer which reveals the movie to be the second that it is.

191
00:14:38,131 --> 00:14:39,896
Rym: I don't think it reveals it fully.

192
00:14:39,956 --> 00:14:48,128
Rym: you couldn't grok the fullness of how bad this movie is from seeing the mirror trailer But if you find the teaser, it was like 30 seconds long.

193
00:14:48,168 --> 00:14:48,550
Rym: Good luck.

194
00:14:48,610 --> 00:15:04,267
Rym: I found freaking anime music video if you can call it that mashups between this and Skycaptain and like Gears of War machinima, oh god, but That's not my news and my news is not just this PSA that don't watch this movie.

195
00:15:04,929 --> 00:15:08,302
Rym: so We're guests at the New York Anime Festival.

196
00:15:08,524 --> 00:15:09,810
Rym: We're doing a whole bunch of events.

197
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:18,442
Rym: I'm not gonna talk about it a lot because we're probably gonna do a whole show on it next week But suffice to say December 7th 8th 9th Javits Center, New York City.

198
00:15:18,462 --> 00:15:29,816
Rym: It's gonna be you know, big anime con and It turns out that they're having the American theatrical premiere of cash earn at The New York Anime Festival.

199
00:15:29,836 --> 00:15:44,190
Rym: now, you know, not only that but it's gonna be unedited Which means that if you are stupid enough to sit down and watch this you're gonna be stuck in that room in an extra 20 Minutes and I doubt highly that those 20 minutes are one uninterrupted explode.

200
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:53,502
Scott: I watched this thing on a fireside Friday when everyone else watched an anime club and It was so long I did was just.

201
00:15:53,522 --> 00:15:57,216
Scott: I wanted it to be over so many times So making it even longer.

202
00:15:57,236 --> 00:16:05,810
Rym: if that that unedited one might be the worst movie there is now Like I said, the 20 minutes might be one uninterrupted explosion, which would be kind of cool.

203
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:14,401
Rym: But I'll bet it's a lot more just insipid uninspired dialogue while people just talk about nothing and then fight with each other stupidly.

204
00:16:15,731 --> 00:16:17,917
Rym: But yeah go to the New York Anime Festival.

205
00:16:18,218 --> 00:16:22,088
Rym: do not for the love of God see this movie do not.

206
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:30,190
Scott: I want that premiere to be empty because People, you know to show the people who are bringing that movie to this country that it's a bad idea that we know it sucks.

207
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,210
Scott: You're not fooling anybody.

208
00:16:38,211 --> 00:16:40,160
Rym: So right along two things of the day.

209
00:16:40,602 --> 00:16:42,370
Rym: my things of the day are in fact two things.

210
00:16:42,731 --> 00:16:50,685
Rym: They are the opener and closer to the 1973 cash earn anime And all I want to say is that I don't know why.

211
00:16:50,986 --> 00:16:54,787
Rym: maybe it's nostalgia maybe just cuz I don't hear this sort of thing as much as I'd like to.

212
00:16:54,868 --> 00:17:02,198
Rym: but This kind of music and this kind of styling even if I don't like the shows I just really dig these kinds of openers that I love.

213
00:17:02,218 --> 00:17:17,454
Scott: I totally love all those old like robot anime type show like theme songs with like the like the oh Japanese guys singing Over like the you know, the this really really retro music.

214
00:17:17,714 --> 00:17:18,277
Scott: I love that.

215
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:19,000
Scott: I love those songs.

216
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:23,656
Scott: I could have my iPod just full of that sort of music like the messenger song.

217
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:24,740
Rym: Don't forget go go go.

218
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:30,020
Scott: That's not the same kind of song I think like a man cross.

219
00:17:30,442 --> 00:17:35,079
Rym: Oh, I think that the go go go song is in the same spectrum, but it's not the far end of it.

220
00:17:35,481 --> 00:17:38,840
Rym: No, I don't think it's at the border between that and something else kinda.

221
00:17:39,422 --> 00:17:44,120
Scott: But yeah, I like I would really like those kind of songs and this has them so awesome.

222
00:17:44,401 --> 00:17:49,060
Rym: Yeah, and I'd recommend that you watch these and the anime and the animated movie before you watch.

223
00:17:49,442 --> 00:17:50,408
Rym: Well, you know not before.

224
00:17:50,449 --> 00:17:52,200
Rym: don't ever watch the movie we talked about.

225
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,854
Scott: No, do not watch the new light the relatively new live-action concern.

226
00:17:56,955 --> 00:17:59,906
Scott: It is bad super bad All right in a bad way.

227
00:17:59,967 --> 00:18:02,520
Scott: Yeah, my thing that is kind of lame.

228
00:18:03,406 --> 00:18:05,080
Scott: So, you know, they make Hello Kitty everything.

229
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,249
Rym: Are you talking about the Hello Kitty treads on the bike?

230
00:18:08,409 --> 00:18:08,730
Rym: Yes.

231
00:18:08,931 --> 00:18:09,292
Rym: Wow.

232
00:18:09,593 --> 00:18:10,677
Rym: Yeah, that's lame.

233
00:18:10,778 --> 00:18:11,440
Scott: It's pretty lame.

234
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:17,560
Rym: Yeah, I know it's a bike tire and the treads are in the shape of Hello Kitty, which is that can't be the best shape.

235
00:18:17,902 --> 00:18:19,510
Scott: No, that's not good for the traction.

236
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,560
Rym: I imagine I guess it could be okay.

237
00:18:21,803 --> 00:18:28,540
Rym: If you're not I mean cuz you know They use basically non treaded kind of like racing slicks in certain kinds of street racing.

238
00:18:28,681 --> 00:18:33,200
Scott: But yeah, I guess if you're just riding your bike around the street slowly and casually this won't be too bad.

239
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,214
Scott: But if you're riding serious, you know any speed this is not gonna be good.

240
00:18:37,234 --> 00:18:39,020
Scott: You'll be slipping and sliding and in badness.

241
00:18:40,104 --> 00:18:41,820
Rym: So what are we talking about tonight?

242
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:59,401
Scott: Let's talk about one of the biggest anime in recent years that we realized we never talked about And is also very easy to kill a show talking about ha funny you put it in those terms The the full metal alchemists full metal Alchemist.

243
00:18:59,561 --> 00:19:04,028
Rym: now, it's rated on the anime news network encyclopedia.

244
00:19:04,048 --> 00:19:09,194
Rym: This is F nav it open as Effectively the greatest fucking show to ever have been made.

245
00:19:09,575 --> 00:19:13,070
Scott: according to everyone It's an okay show.

246
00:19:13,433 --> 00:19:15,786
Rym: Well, here's the thing I'll set the stage full.

247
00:19:15,806 --> 00:19:21,607
Rym: metal alchemists came out in an era which wasn't that long ago Where maybe it wasn't.

248
00:19:21,647 --> 00:19:24,800
Rym: the error is just more that it was the big show of its time.

249
00:19:25,001 --> 00:19:27,751
Scott: Well, we're basically what was going on right is that?

250
00:19:28,052 --> 00:19:31,671
Scott: you know, we were in like with a third or fourth year college Something like that, right?

251
00:19:31,853 --> 00:19:39,700
Scott: Yeah, and You know, we were super anime fans and we had you know We had been watching bit like tons and tons of anime starting freshman year.

252
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,853
Rym: We were like super anime watching right and mostly we were watching old stuff.

253
00:19:43,873 --> 00:19:46,623
Rym: We'd never seen and kind of getting caught up in the anime We're

254
00:19:46,663 --> 00:19:55,982
Scott: watching like the best shows ever and we were watching You know new best shows and it that the well was sort of drying up, you know I mean

255
00:19:56,042 --> 00:19:59,920
Rym: it got to the point where I considered watching beyond the first season of fushigi Yugi.

256
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,914
Rym: That's how much anime I was watching.

257
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:02,679
Rym: I was running out.

258
00:20:02,941 --> 00:20:16,980
Scott: Yeah, you know and we were watching all kinds of shows around then and you know It was a new anime season and everyone was grabbing mad fan subs with our mad bandwidths, right and You know, there are a lot of shows that came out that season.

259
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,740
Scott: We were trying different ones out and you know, some of them were good and some of them were okay.

260
00:20:20,881 --> 00:20:31,399
Scott: but it was sort of like the first season where people were going through the fan subs looking for the new hot show and It's sort of everyone by what everyone was going to the same site download the same fan subs and sort of.

261
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:36,213
Scott: this Consensus came out that full metal alchemist was the hot show and like.

262
00:20:36,314 --> 00:20:45,823
Scott: I had known it about it and I downloaded an episode but I hadn't watched it and then people started talking about it, so I watched it and Everyone was sort of like oh, yeah This shows the business

263
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:50,640
Rym: now as time went on and then when it got released, you know legitimately in the u.s.

264
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:57,745
Rym: And it became the super big show most and it seems like this happens Every like.

265
00:20:57,765 --> 00:21:00,474
Rym: there's a cycle of years whereby the show will come out.

266
00:21:00,494 --> 00:21:02,000
Rym: that does this to anime fandom where?

267
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,560
Rym: Everyone who's new ish to anime.

268
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:11,559
Rym: I'm not saying that older fans didn't like it too, but for people who are kind of just getting into it There's like a certain kind of person who was primed for this.

269
00:21:12,081 --> 00:21:16,496
Rym: they'll see full metal alchemist or back when it was on for Shige Yugi did this.

270
00:21:16,556 --> 00:21:22,658
Rym: a lot of shows have done this over the years and They would just kind of decide collectively that it's the best show ever.

271
00:21:23,881 --> 00:21:37,715
Rym: that this show is so amazing and so beyond anything they've ever seen and ever will see and This is going to go down in history is one of the best anime ever and I guess you could call it full medical full medical full metal alchemist.

272
00:21:37,816 --> 00:21:43,879
Rym: frenzy People were just Every con at a billion FMA cosplayers and they still do.

273
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:44,779
Scott: yeah I mean basically.

274
00:21:45,242 --> 00:21:51,308
Scott: But we when I when we were at the point where we had only seen like four or five episodes of this show It was like, you know, wow.

275
00:21:51,368 --> 00:21:54,300
Scott: Look here is you know, like a show that's giving us.

276
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:01,975
Scott: You know the kind of plots we get in our Final Fantasy type games, you know That's sort of plot which you know, everyone who's like anime fans.

277
00:22:02,015 --> 00:22:03,761
Scott: That's their favorite kind of plot I know.

278
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:08,200
Scott: so everyone was digging that and it had a lot of awesome characters and people were digging that.

279
00:22:09,164 --> 00:22:10,599
Scott: It was coming out right now.

280
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:15,700
Scott: So every time a new episode came out like everyone would get together and watch it like all man's a new episode.

281
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:19,880
Scott: Oh man's a new episode and the show was doing things that you know.

282
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:26,159
Scott: We're I guess okay ish and people and you had really good opening and closing music all the time.

283
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:33,469
Rym: Yep I mean, I think the thing is it seems like this show was almost Engineered to be that big show.

284
00:22:33,509 --> 00:22:36,498
Scott: definitely was it had something to appeal to?

285
00:22:37,722 --> 00:22:44,900
Rym: Everyone Everyone who was a fan of anime with rare exception there was something they would like enough to watch this entire show.

286
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,793
Scott: Yeah, it's like if you like some fighting action, there's some fighting action.

287
00:22:47,813 --> 00:22:53,032
Scott: if you like some, you know Character dramas this character drop you like this stupid bald man.

288
00:22:53,052 --> 00:22:53,794
Rym: Oh, yeah.

289
00:22:53,834 --> 00:22:55,720
Scott: Yeah, you like wacky comedies.

290
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,567
Scott: They got wacky comedies pervertedness.

291
00:22:57,607 --> 00:22:59,956
Scott: They got some girls in there the show girls.

292
00:23:00,217 --> 00:23:01,080
Rym: We got girls.

293
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:14,860
Scott: The show is a little bit of everything Awesome j-rock j-pop opening and closing music The music actually that the show music is actually really good Even today, you know I looking back on it.

294
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,440
Rym: Yeah, it was kind of modal and there were a lot of like little almost light motifs and we'll talk about that later.

295
00:23:20,782 --> 00:23:22,739
Scott: But and the show is coming out now.

296
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:29,480
Scott: Well, not now But then it was now so and everyone is all over it and there wasn't much competition from the other shows at the time.

297
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:31,594
Rym: What was even out at the same time?

298
00:23:31,614 --> 00:23:36,036
Scott: I Don't really remember because FMA sort of overshadowed all of them.

299
00:23:36,438 --> 00:23:50,380
Rym: Yeah but The show in addition to all that it had kind of the plot or the hook or what was going on was Kind of different and kind of interesting and I think if nothing else that is what drew a lot of people to it.

300
00:23:50,781 --> 00:24:17,250
Rym: the story effectively is that there are two brothers the Elric brothers Ed and Al Elric and one thing led to another and Their mom is dead and they know alchemy and the principles of alchemy are kind of like the driving force of this universe and they kind of drill it into you constantly that Nothing can be created without destroying something equal, you know equivalent exchange to Oka Oka

301
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:18,371
Scott: Yep,

302
00:24:18,993 --> 00:24:21,623
Rym: and I don't really how much should we spoil?

303
00:24:21,664 --> 00:24:23,350
Rym: I mean, I feel like most people have seen this show.

304
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:25,964
Rym: I feel like this is more commentary than telling people to watch it.

305
00:24:26,849 --> 00:24:27,836
Scott: Ah I don't know.

306
00:24:27,957 --> 00:24:29,750
Scott: You probably don't want to give away too much action.

307
00:24:30,152 --> 00:24:36,459
Rym: Well, let me put it this way the show the first two episodes Set up the whole scene for you without any doubt.

308
00:24:36,499 --> 00:24:37,481
Rym: the first episode

309
00:24:37,802 --> 00:25:00,290
Scott: the first two episodes are actually sort of like this contained like story on its own like just within the world of the characters that really introduces to you the core characters and Then sort of shows you the way the world works and then closes up that tiny story and then the characters move on To another place where the actual plot is happening, you know.

310
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:09,080
Scott: So it's sort of like they tell you sort of like this mini story with the characters sort of like in Trigun like the first like, you know, four or five episodes.

311
00:25:10,012 --> 00:25:19,506
Scott: actually a lot of the episodes dragon are just like many stories that are sort of self-contained involving the characters to set everything up and Then they move on to where the big plot is elsewhere.

312
00:25:19,526 --> 00:25:20,633
Rym: now What help is that?

313
00:25:20,774 --> 00:25:23,970
Rym: all the things that introduced in this little two episode mini story?

314
00:25:24,553 --> 00:25:35,679
Rym: Were great and also because they didn't really have to Flesh a lot out and in terms of you know beyond what what we see at face value And because they didn't bother with backstory yet.

315
00:25:35,699 --> 00:25:37,385
Rym: They pretty much threw you in media res.

316
00:25:37,967 --> 00:25:40,972
Rym: I used a fancy word It.

317
00:25:41,454 --> 00:25:45,130
Rym: it just hit the ground running and you were pretty much captivated right away.

318
00:25:45,512 --> 00:25:51,984
Rym: if you if you were gonna like the show at all, you liked it in the first five minutes of the first episode and Definitely by the end of the first episode.

319
00:25:52,004 --> 00:25:52,709
Scott: Oh, yeah.

320
00:25:53,271 --> 00:25:59,610
Rym: And also they were able to make things appear extremely symbolic and there was a lot of like.

321
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:04,626
Rym: I guess the theme or the moral or kind of what was going on in that first two episode thing.

322
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:08,626
Rym: I Don't want to say it was deeper than the actual show because I don't think it was.

323
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:12,149
Rym: I think it's more that It set the show up to be very heavy.

324
00:26:13,091 --> 00:26:17,522
Scott: It did the show definitely, you know appeared even though I think it was.

325
00:26:17,883 --> 00:26:20,570
Scott: the show in reality is a lot shallower than it appears.

326
00:26:21,051 --> 00:26:21,773
Scott: It's sort of like.

327
00:26:21,793 --> 00:26:22,756
Scott: it's sort of.

328
00:26:22,776 --> 00:26:43,234
Scott: I think Gerald was complaining that like the the director has actually a trend In all the the things they direct of making things Appear to be a lot deeper than they actually are, you know, it's sort of like, you know They go around saying toga coca like there's some this big deep hidden message of you know Symbolism and well

329
00:26:43,254 --> 00:26:44,237
Rym: at the same time.

330
00:26:44,318 --> 00:26:48,370
Rym: I'm not gonna spoil but I do point out what happens with all that.

331
00:26:49,072 --> 00:26:53,930
Scott: But while there is a metaphor some message it's not a super deep message, it's just.

332
00:26:55,274 --> 00:27:11,909
Rym: I'll put it straight up in the first two episodes one of the One or two of the themes that come up and they hit you pretty strong with this are a lot of kind of controversial and possibly uncomfortable ideas about the nature of religion and belief and fanaticism.

333
00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:14,065
Scott: and Yeah, but it's not like it's.

334
00:27:14,106 --> 00:27:26,870
Rym: some Was not really about that But the first two episodes in a vacuum very much made it appear that the show was about that.

335
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:27,812
Scott: Oh, that is true.

336
00:27:27,873 --> 00:27:28,374
Scott: That is true.

337
00:27:28,715 --> 00:27:31,944
Rym: There was very much this science versus religion.

338
00:27:32,305 --> 00:27:33,187
Rym: What is belief?

339
00:27:33,448 --> 00:27:34,130
Rym: What are we?

340
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,073
Rym: What are we made of?

341
00:27:35,173 --> 00:27:39,890
Rym: and the show didn't really keep running with those ideas as much as it probably could have.

342
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:45,533
Scott: Yeah after after that stuff the show basically the format of the show is Everyone.

343
00:27:45,553 --> 00:27:50,811
Scott: they set up or they bring in a bunch of characters that everyone loves and then they just sort of play up the characters in.

344
00:27:51,812 --> 00:27:58,087
Scott: You know ways that make you continue to love them because there's a character for everyone no matter what you like and they just keep

345
00:27:58,127 --> 00:27:58,508
Rym: playing

346
00:27:58,608 --> 00:28:07,386
Scott: up all the characters and you know to make them be at their best all the time and They just keep moving forward with the plot at a steady pace to keep you going.

347
00:28:07,466 --> 00:28:08,490
Scott: and it worked.

348
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:12,610
Scott: Everyone was watching it every week and continued to look forward to watching every week until it ended.

349
00:28:12,951 --> 00:28:20,925
Rym: So I thought what they did that was actually was I I think it worked really well was since they started kind of in the middle of the story and then they flash back.

350
00:28:20,966 --> 00:28:31,933
Rym: so you're introduced to a Boy, who's kind of yelling but yet he's powerful for some reason and all these other minor characters and a giant empty suit of armor Huh?

351
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,841
Rym: And you then it seems like almost superficially.

352
00:28:35,982 --> 00:28:43,719
Rym: All right, this is gonna be one of those kind of Nonsensical silly shows despite all the themes and morals and things that we've been kind of peppered with right away.

353
00:28:43,739 --> 00:28:53,170
Rym: and Then you so you're kind of set up to you know Where the show is going to get to and then it backs up and you see how they got to where they are.

354
00:28:53,250 --> 00:29:00,790
Rym: Yeah, and then it dawns on you that because it when it backs up It's just two young brothers two little boys with a sick mother and a missing dad.

355
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:07,790
Scott: Yeah It's the typical, you know slowly reveal the past instead of like Trigun revealed the past all at once.

356
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:08,874
Scott: But this is the typical.

357
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:17,614
Scott: many shows do this where you slowly reveal more and more about the hidden past Until the whole past is finally revealed and they did it, you know About it.

358
00:29:17,634 --> 00:29:18,981
Scott: They didn't do it amazingly.

359
00:29:19,021 --> 00:29:20,990
Scott: They did it, you know as well as could be expect.

360
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:24,502
Scott: Well, I think what is a formula and they executed it, you know as it should be.

361
00:29:24,843 --> 00:29:25,365
Rym: but enough about.

362
00:29:25,405 --> 00:29:26,008
Rym: I mean just to.

363
00:29:26,028 --> 00:29:28,256
Rym: I don't Really go into like.

364
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:37,350
Rym: I don't want to discuss the show as though we're trying to sell it to people who haven't seen it and I don't want to I don't know review it fully because that would require, you know spoilers and final thoughts.

365
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:44,250
Rym: But I think what really drew me into the show the point at which I decided that this show is going to be great.

366
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:50,695
Rym: I'm gonna like it was after the first two episodes and they go through the backstory And I'll spoil in case you haven't heard.

367
00:29:50,735 --> 00:29:51,759
Rym: but the deal with their mother.

368
00:29:52,321 --> 00:29:55,170
Rym: because essentially what happens is their mother dies.

369
00:29:55,893 --> 00:29:58,044
Rym: I don't think that's that much of a spoiler, but she dies.

370
00:29:58,064 --> 00:29:59,250
Rym: She had cancer or something.

371
00:29:59,614 --> 00:30:06,886
Rym: she'd been sick for a long time and These boys know alchemy because their father was an alchemist who went off to war or something.

372
00:30:06,906 --> 00:30:08,010
Rym: They're not too clear about that.

373
00:30:08,211 --> 00:30:09,516
Scott: They don't really say he's like.

374
00:30:09,536 --> 00:30:11,846
Scott: they show you the family photo and the dad is like blurred out.

375
00:30:11,886 --> 00:30:20,850
Rym: You can't see his face but The and this is actually and I know this is the moment because our friend Luke had avoided this show on fansub.

376
00:30:21,051 --> 00:30:25,236
Scott: Well, because what he had the opinion that it's popular it can't possibly be good.

377
00:30:25,416 --> 00:30:37,887
Rym: Emily avoided it for similar reasons and a lot of people did because The hysteria around this show by a lot of fans really turned off a lot of I don't want to say more discerning people But maybe it's it seemed

378
00:30:37,947 --> 00:30:38,189
Scott: really

379
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:43,650
Rym: Possible that the show was one of those crap shows that people suddenly get really really into for no good reason.

380
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:44,172
Rym: Yeah,

381
00:30:44,272 --> 00:30:57,193
Scott: I can't I can't blame the people who felt that way because like I felt the same way initially about Naruto I sort of didn't go and see Naruto on purpose And then I saw the first four episodes like at anime club, you know, I didn't go out of my way to see them I just happened to see.

382
00:30:57,233 --> 00:31:09,310
Rym: I think there's a difference between if I see a show just in a vacuum or if I'm at a Con and like eight kids wearing identical poorly made costumes run past me yelling the characters names from a new show.

383
00:31:09,852 --> 00:31:14,129
Rym: Yeah, I just I probably irrationally feel like maybe I should avoid that show.

384
00:31:14,635 --> 00:31:15,629
Rym: Yeah, I can't blame anyone.

385
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:20,249
Rym: No, our friend Luke is a huge anime fan had avoided it and avoided it and avoided it.

386
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:23,729
Rym: So finally, we're at Otakon.

387
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:28,678
Rym: We're seeing Laruku live in that awesome concert.

388
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:35,395
Scott: Yep, and then the band that did this, you know the second opener for the show The Fullmetal Alchemist.

389
00:31:35,415 --> 00:31:40,150
Rym: Yeah, that was also like I think possibly one of the best Otakons just for that concert.

390
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:47,238
Scott: So at this concert before the concert started while you were sitting there waiting for them to come on Right on the giant video screens.

391
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:50,050
Scott: They show the first episode of Fullmetal Alchemist.

392
00:31:51,044 --> 00:31:55,220
Scott: and You know This is the first time Luke had ever seen the show that he was avoiding.

393
00:31:55,522 --> 00:31:59,276
Rym: and I believe they also showed a trailer Like for the show.

394
00:31:59,336 --> 00:32:12,610
Rym: it was like they were shown the first episode and the short little trailer kind of thing like this is what this show is about and I remember they revealed to some degree the fact that the boys tried to bring their mother back to life with alchemy.

395
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,379
Rym: But what do you trade it?

396
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:17,630
Rym: You know Toka Koka equivalent exchange?

397
00:32:18,112 --> 00:32:20,201
Rym: Well, we've got all the components of a human body.

398
00:32:20,241 --> 00:32:22,209
Rym: we've got the sulfur and we've got the whatnot.

399
00:32:23,054 --> 00:32:25,488
Rym: What do you trade for a human soul?

400
00:32:26,571 --> 00:32:33,473
Scott: Dan Dan Dan I think that is one thing that definitely attracted a lot of people to the show is that you know Part of the.

401
00:32:33,774 --> 00:32:49,335
Scott: I think one of the main reasons that a lot of American people in the u.s You know became such fans of anime in the first place way back was because you know, they like Animation and cartoons because that's you know, what they grew up on and They were looking for.

402
00:32:49,576 --> 00:32:58,170
Scott: animation and cartoons that had more serious stuff going on in them instead of you know Looney Tunes drop an anvil on this our serious fan and this our serious business.

403
00:32:58,311 --> 00:32:58,572
Rym: So

404
00:32:58,713 --> 00:33:17,263
Scott: when you have a show that's you know dealing with issues like, you know Bringing your mother back from the dead and then having to sacrifice your soul and getting horrible punishment for that and stuff like that That's sort of the kind of thing that really attracted people anime in the first place And thus if you have a show like that will attract more people

405
00:33:17,886 --> 00:33:18,830
Rym: and also helped at the show.

406
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:46,970
Rym: I mean that was a very dark element and I remember seeing that like when the whole thing with their mother was revealed Initially, that was a chilling Scary dark disturbing and sad scene in an otherwise serious but kind of upbeat and silly anime and it seems like shows that have Elements of humor and elements of seriousness like that as long as they don't go overboard like Gravitation which was like super happy super sad super happy super sad.

407
00:33:47,854 --> 00:33:51,430
Rym: It seems to work really well, especially in terms of getting people to watch the show.

408
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:57,332
Scott: Well, what you do is you get it happens I think more in Fullmetal Alchemist than any other show I've seen is sort of those, you know The.

409
00:33:57,413 --> 00:34:03,310
Scott: those times when you know They they all they stay bring the stark Contrast right up in your face.

410
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:12,525
Scott: like you see these characters laughing and making stupid jokes about being short that aren't funny and They're like and then they remind you like there's actually horrible.

411
00:34:12,645 --> 00:34:18,524
Rym: and you see the characters going like And then it cuts back to them being happy and you just can't help but think.

412
00:34:18,905 --> 00:34:20,530
Rym: but they went through all of that.

413
00:34:21,012 --> 00:34:22,400
Scott: It's like the put they'll have kill you.

414
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:31,721
Scott: they'll show you characters laughing the voice actors will be laughing kinda and then they're playing like the dark theme music and Like half the screen is the character laughing.

415
00:34:31,741 --> 00:34:36,998
Scott: the other half of the screen is like some Visual symbol that reminds you of a horribleness that is awaiting.

416
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:39,565
Rym: the music did that really well in this show.

417
00:34:39,585 --> 00:34:43,539
Rym: the soundtrack we mentioned before the the musical motifs like.

418
00:34:43,579 --> 00:34:56,089
Rym: there were certain themes and phrases of music that were Kind of synonymous with certain characters or certain events or certain memories in the show and you'd start to associate these with certain kinds of happenings.

419
00:34:56,511 --> 00:35:01,950
Rym: So a lot of scenes that would otherwise be just a normal scene or just seen in the anime.

420
00:35:02,431 --> 00:35:07,506
Rym: They play music that didn't fit and you think back to other scenes for that music played.

421
00:35:07,546 --> 00:35:11,985
Rym: and I think that was one of the Show's strongest points is its use of music to create a mood.

422
00:35:12,487 --> 00:35:14,897
Scott: Yeah, the music Remember later in the show.

423
00:35:14,937 --> 00:35:26,610
Rym: There's that scratchy song playing on the record that Yeah Yep, and that was one creepy scene I gotta say in the music in the show.

424
00:35:26,851 --> 00:35:33,214
Scott: It's not the best music ever for an anime But it's definitely among the best music's for animes mean 15.

425
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,542
Rym: it's one of them and they use.

426
00:35:35,562 --> 00:35:37,930
Scott: the music is as bad as well as it can be used.

427
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:42,786
Rym: It's not the best music like ever but it's one of the best uses of music in anime.

428
00:35:42,806 --> 00:35:46,847
Scott: I've seen in a long time Yeah, the other anime is you know, a lot of animes.

429
00:35:46,928 --> 00:35:53,910
Scott: now They're not using music, you know, because the use of music in anime in general is one of the things that really sets anime apart.

430
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:57,664
Scott: You know, you have these original Composed orchestral score just for the show.

431
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:04,510
Rym: Look at eska flown a. how many just basically symphonies were written just to be background music in that show.

432
00:36:04,732 --> 00:36:13,673
Scott: Yeah, and you know they they have a different you know song for every possible theme and mood in the show and for every character and for every type of Thing that goes on.

433
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:27,400
Scott: and they they reuse them or they reuse them by changing them slightly to sort of you know really set the mood and the tone and whatever is going on and Full metal alchemist does that as well as that anime can.

434
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:40,781
Rym: basically the show really seemed to kind of change gears in Pretty much every possible sense at the perfect intervals to keep anyone interested like no matter What kind of scene was going on sad happy fighting whatever.

435
00:36:40,821 --> 00:36:45,412
Rym: they'd always kind of switch it up or cut away or flash to something different.

436
00:36:45,894 --> 00:36:53,533
Rym: it's like they were juggling all the different kinds of anime fans and making sure that every kind of fan had their five minutes in Every episode.

437
00:36:53,553 --> 00:36:53,995
Rym: Yep.

438
00:36:54,717 --> 00:36:55,059
Scott: All right.

439
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:58,270
Scott: So do you think if someone hasn't seen full metal alchemist?

440
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:01,290
Scott: Do you think it's worth it to like buy all the DVDs and watch it?

441
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:06,389
Rym: I think it's worth it to watch the DVDs on Netflix, perhaps maybe it's you.

442
00:37:07,212 --> 00:37:12,170
Rym: This is what I find interesting because I this happens to people a lot, especially.

443
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:15,923
Rym: well maybe not especially but just because I see it more here because I pay attention more.

444
00:37:15,963 --> 00:37:23,969
Rym: but it happens to anime fans where When a show is good and you're watching it as it comes out It seems like it's just this amazing show.

445
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:39,610
Rym: Yeah, but then when you're done with it and you you're so satisfied it was so great and then years later you think back and You feel like you could never watch the show again, or you wouldn't enjoy it Or maybe it wasn't as good as you thought it was even though you remember enjoying it.

446
00:37:39,771 --> 00:37:40,677
Scott: I definitely have.

447
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,288
Scott: I definitely have that feeling where.

448
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:43,576
Scott: well I think part of it is.

449
00:37:43,616 --> 00:37:46,169
Scott: I didn't enjoy the ending as much as some other people did.

450
00:37:46,813 --> 00:37:49,830
Scott: I mean it was okay, but it wasn't like oh my god an awesome ending.

451
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:51,557
Rym: well the end made me cry that doesn't?

452
00:37:51,578 --> 00:37:58,186
Rym: that doesn't necessarily mean it's a great ending because I've Cried at the end of I think a good third of all the anime I've ever seen.

453
00:37:58,207 --> 00:37:59,617
Scott: it didn't make me cry I was just like.

454
00:37:59,738 --> 00:38:07,450
Scott: it wasn't like I was Expecting or an anticipating an ending that would like blow me over and it was just kind of an ending like ah an ending.

455
00:38:07,753 --> 00:38:25,463
Rym: Yeah, see the thing is regardless of the physical, you know what happened at the end of the show because that I think could have been had a lot better and It pretty much The I. well this is my main beef with the show and I'll do a quick aside about this because it relates to the movie the show ends on.

456
00:38:26,834 --> 00:38:30,354
Rym: They tried to have their cake and eat it too, but the cake was a lie There is.

457
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:33,287
Rym: they tried to milk every possible way.

458
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:52,196
Rym: the show could have ended by kind of doing all of them like ah and you get this kind of ending but then up and you also get this kind of ending and They instead of wrapping up all the loose strings they kind of unfrayed the end of the rope and made a million more strings and then ended on a Super cliffhanger.

459
00:38:52,216 --> 00:38:53,442
Scott: Yeah, I definitely like.

460
00:38:53,502 --> 00:39:08,249
Scott: during the course of the show There were like certain characters and certain plot lines that were ended Climactically like, you know about two-thirds of the way through the show like there was a holiday So they had to miss an episode because there was a soccer game or something like that.

461
00:39:08,671 --> 00:39:26,209
Scott: So the next week there was a double episode and with that double episode Which is basically two episodes that I think aired together they like ended a part of the plot line and remitted made a big reveal and a climax and That was like super awesome at least at the time and I felt like the show the end of the whole show should have ended.

462
00:39:26,612 --> 00:39:27,809
Scott: You know been as awesome as that.

463
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:29,114
Scott: well The thing is it wasn't.

464
00:39:29,355 --> 00:39:37,750
Rym: it could have been because the end of the show basically set up The best fucking movie ever much like cashier and set us up for the best fucking movie ever.

465
00:39:38,352 --> 00:39:42,309
Scott: It was like, all right still haven't seen the Full Metal Alchemist movie cuz I know better.

466
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:51,830
Rym: Yeah, but if the movie had been what it should have been then Then the end of Full Metal Alchemist would have been great because it set up a great movie.

467
00:39:52,171 --> 00:39:59,821
Rym: but from what I have heard from everyone I trust the Full Metal Alchemist movie is Barely, if at all worth watching.

468
00:39:59,841 --> 00:40:07,529
Rym: I'll probably watch it someday Yeah, but it's I don't want to spoil at all what it's about because that that actually ruins the kind of big reveal in the show.

469
00:40:07,951 --> 00:40:13,270
Scott: I think generally my feelings on Full Metal Alchemist is that when I was watching it when it was new it felt pretty awesome.

470
00:40:13,471 --> 00:40:19,318
Scott: I mean, it didn't feel as awesome as like, you know the best shows ever But it was like one step under the best shows ever.

471
00:40:19,419 --> 00:40:22,970
Rym: It was no Cowboy Bebop Escaflowne, Evangelion, Trigon.

472
00:40:23,412 --> 00:40:28,230
Scott: No, it was like right under all those shows which was you know better than any anime I had seen in a long time.

473
00:40:28,351 --> 00:40:32,210
Scott: And now looking back it feels like it's two steps behind those shows, you know.

474
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:35,783
Scott: And like at the time it felt better than it does.

475
00:40:35,843 --> 00:40:36,907
Scott: looking back on you know what.

476
00:40:36,948 --> 00:40:44,490
Rym: I'll sum it up The show was a great show to watch but it's not a show to rewatch and it wasn't a show that had staying power.

477
00:40:45,133 --> 00:40:46,561
Rym: It's like Cowboy Bebop.

478
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:48,209
Rym: I could finish it.

479
00:40:48,731 --> 00:40:53,770
Scott: I could watch any episode at any time any number of times for the rest of my life.

480
00:40:54,031 --> 00:40:55,519
Scott: It's probably the only show that can do that.

481
00:40:55,539 --> 00:40:56,022
Rym: Well, let's see.

482
00:40:56,082 --> 00:40:57,510
Rym: What is there that's like that for us?

483
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:02,450
Rym: There's the first three Star Wars movies as in the fourth fifth and sixth Star Wars movie.

484
00:41:02,671 --> 00:41:04,558
Rym: Yep, and like Cowboy Bebop.

485
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,626
Rym: I think Escaflowne for me.

486
00:41:06,686 --> 00:41:08,574
Rym: I just that show was so great I've only seen it once.

487
00:41:08,915 --> 00:41:12,450
Rym: I've seen it three times all the way through and every time I love it.

488
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:17,170
Scott: So there are lots of leiji Matsumoto things that I can watch but it's like I have always.

489
00:41:18,092 --> 00:41:20,770
Scott: It's not like I can watch them over and over again.

490
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:26,118
Scott: It's that when I get in the mood to watch one I can watch one and I'm in the mood to watch them Relatively often.

491
00:41:26,702 --> 00:41:31,031
Rym: Yeah, it's just the show Wasn't good enough to watch again like.

492
00:41:31,672 --> 00:41:38,610
Rym: I think most of what drew people forward and most of what kept me going was that I Wanted to know the mysteries of this world.

493
00:41:38,971 --> 00:41:48,800
Rym: I wanted to know what was behind that gate and why the things happen the way they did and what does all the stuff where their dad went who he was and all those mysteries.

494
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:51,990
Rym: and It's kind of like as the mysteries got revealed.

495
00:41:52,593 --> 00:42:14,250
Rym: I cared less about the show and unlike say an Escaflowne which is just so well executed that I could watch it again or unlike say a Nutenna where I can watch it again and get more of it because now I'm like getting Understanding from learning the reason behind a mystery or something that happened later in the show Could kind of illuminate things that happened earlier.

496
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:16,759
Rym: I feel like that's not true in Fullmetal Alchemist.

497
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:21,356
Scott: Fullmetal Alchemist after one viewing everything is illuminated There's no more to to illuminate.

498
00:42:21,637 --> 00:42:24,967
Rym: everything is illuminated by the way is a fantastic movie, right?

499
00:42:25,549 --> 00:42:31,446
Scott: It is Yeah, also I'm buying the Fullmetal Alchemist manga like I have every volume of it.

500
00:42:31,486 --> 00:42:32,370
Scott: It's in English so far.

501
00:42:32,652 --> 00:42:36,297
Scott: Yeah, we should probably mention this Yeah, and I'm not stopping buying it.

502
00:42:36,798 --> 00:42:40,670
Scott: But first of all, it is by no means some amazing manga of all time.

503
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,399
Scott: It's no Akira, Tezuka, whatever.

504
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:44,710
Scott: It's a slightly above average manga.

505
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:50,450
Scott: That is funny and entertaining and for me at least it's worth buying at a discount price, which is what I pay.

506
00:42:50,773 --> 00:42:52,147
Scott: I wouldn't buy it if it was full price.

507
00:42:52,168 --> 00:42:56,190
Scott: and For the first part of the manga, it's a lot like the show.

508
00:42:56,270 --> 00:43:00,470
Scott: I mean the first volume is basically a lot like the first few episodes, you know, and whatever.

509
00:43:01,052 --> 00:43:03,924
Scott: But then a few volumes in I think like six to ten.

510
00:43:03,964 --> 00:43:05,109
Scott: I don't remember exactly where.

511
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:10,530
Scott: Basically, the manga becomes completely different from the show like super different.

512
00:43:10,633 --> 00:43:14,890
Scott: There are just Blatant differences like wow, that is not like it at all.

513
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:15,232
Scott: And there's.

514
00:43:15,474 --> 00:43:17,949
Scott: there's characters in the manga that never appear in the show.

515
00:43:18,411 --> 00:43:20,802
Scott: There's things that like things are.

516
00:43:21,204 --> 00:43:25,461
Scott: there's just basic facts Like who people are is different in like.

517
00:43:25,983 --> 00:43:36,900
Scott: there's characters that are in both but it'll be the same like character design and the character of a different name in one in the other or a different role in One in the other or act a different way in one in the other.

518
00:43:36,961 --> 00:43:49,369
Scott: and so the anime and the manga are not equal Which is in a way it's actually okay because if you've seen the show already It's not like Death Note where if you've seen the movie the anime There's no reason to buy the manga and vice versa because they're exactly the same.

519
00:43:50,032 --> 00:43:56,570
Scott: You can read the full melagamous manga having read the having watched the anime and you'll get something different out of it.

520
00:43:56,871 --> 00:43:58,617
Scott: It's a different thing and it's pretty.

521
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:01,928
Scott: it's a lot longer and it goes more but it's most.

522
00:44:01,968 --> 00:44:08,669
Scott: it's more typical anime plotty stuff and less of the the deep kind of stuff though or at least the Pretending to be deep stuff.

523
00:44:09,131 --> 00:44:14,570
Rym: I mean, I guess in the end FMA was kind of just a blockbuster anime much like a blockbuster movie.

524
00:44:14,931 --> 00:44:17,058
Rym: It's great to watch you'll enjoy the ride.

525
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,330
Rym: You'll probably not bother watching it again.

526
00:44:20,771 --> 00:44:31,008
Scott: Yeah, it's just like one of those like summer fun fests you go to the movie theater You spend some money you sit down you go woo his explosions whatever and you know, it's pretty awesome.

527
00:44:31,028 --> 00:44:37,535
Scott: while you're in there You know, it's rocking your socks off and then you know a year later if someone mentions the movie like yeah I saw that in the theater.

528
00:44:38,038 --> 00:44:41,295
Scott: Yeah, there's no really reason to ever see that again It's it's not worth.

529
00:44:41,335 --> 00:44:44,490
Rym: my thing is I just don't think the show will have the staying power.

530
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:48,575
Rym: Even you know in the years to come that you know cowboy bebop Italia had.

531
00:44:48,635 --> 00:44:51,490
Rym: I think that it's kind of gonna go the way for Shiggy Yugi.

532
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:56,890
Rym: I just use that because it's the perfect example of a similar Show in terms of how the fans reacted to it.

533
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:58,877
Rym: And I think it'll always be known.

534
00:44:58,938 --> 00:45:05,916
Rym: like a lot of people just know for Shiggy you even if they haven't seen it and you Always see at least one It's for Shiggy.

535
00:45:06,177 --> 00:45:06,439
Rym: Okay.

536
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:16,098
Rym: No, alright, Scott Johnson always said But you always see a Miyake or two.

537
00:45:16,178 --> 00:45:17,481
Rym: it pretty much every anime con.

538
00:45:17,521 --> 00:45:24,990
Rym: you're probably always gonna see an Edward Elric or maybe I'll lost at every anime con for the next decade or so.

539
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:30,169
Rym: But the show is not gonna be remembered as this great work ten years from now.

540
00:45:30,491 --> 00:45:35,850
Rym: Well, I think ten years from now cowboy bebop will still be considered one of the greatest works of anime probably.

541
