1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,639
Rym: It's Tuesday, August 7th, 2012.

2
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:12,100
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,983
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,103 --> 00:00:14,607
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:15,770
Rym: Tonight, tournaments.

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,962
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,772 --> 00:00:26,415
Rym: I am back from Brazil.

8
00:00:26,595 --> 00:00:27,136
Scott: Brazil.

9
00:00:27,477 --> 00:00:30,886
Rym: I'll do a show later like on some Thursday about being in Brazil, but it was pretty fun.

10
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:33,094
Rym: I would go again.

11
00:00:33,114 --> 00:00:39,216
Scott: Yeah, Brazil is a weird place because it has good things and bad things in great combination.

12
00:00:39,276 --> 00:00:42,509
Rym: The city, Sao Paulo, super modern, super chill.

13
00:00:42,529 --> 00:00:43,372
Scott: Wouldn't it be modern?

14
00:00:43,392 --> 00:00:48,070
Rym: We wandered around like the equivalent of Fifth Avenue and had nice dinners and it was crazy.

15
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:56,561
Rym: But at the same time, you notice that half the cars on the street are armored as in an inch of bulletproof glass and bomb proofing.

16
00:00:57,845 --> 00:01:01,516
Rym: And yeah, the one thing that I can say is that I did some research.

17
00:01:01,857 --> 00:01:07,032
Rym: Brazil recently fell off of the top 10 list of most violent countries.

18
00:01:07,332 --> 00:01:08,215
Rym: So they're getting better.

19
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:11,366
Rym: A lot of violent crime and kidnapping, though.

20
00:01:11,929 --> 00:01:15,725
Rym: Yeah, but no, I hope but also lots of good stuff.

21
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,251
Rym: I get to go back soon.

22
00:01:17,391 --> 00:01:22,675
Scott: It's weird that a lot of countries, you know, it's like you look around the world and it's like, ah, you know, you live in the U.S.

23
00:01:22,996 --> 00:01:24,866
Scott: and you look around and you say, look at that country.

24
00:01:24,926 --> 00:01:28,502
Scott: They have something awesome that we don't have like Portugal.

25
00:01:28,543 --> 00:01:30,693
Scott: You can just you know, the drug policy there is great.

26
00:01:31,315 --> 00:01:32,561
Scott: What problems do they have?

27
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:34,167
Scott: The economy not so great.

28
00:01:34,809 --> 00:01:37,017
Rym: They speak Portuguese on Brazil.

29
00:01:37,037 --> 00:01:37,258
Scott: They do.

30
00:01:37,278 --> 00:01:44,440
Rym: Let me tell you, Portuguese, Spanish people who speak Portuguese can understand Spanish just fine.

31
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:48,836
Rym: But people who speak Spanish can't understand shit of what Portuguese people say.

32
00:01:49,539 --> 00:02:00,063
Rym: And that was and the weirdest part of that is I could read the menus at restaurants better than the Spanish speaking, learning Portuguese guy I was with because a lot of it was in Japanese.

33
00:02:00,544 --> 00:02:00,845
Scott: Really?

34
00:02:00,926 --> 00:02:02,110
Rym: A lot of Asians there.

35
00:02:02,471 --> 00:02:03,234
Scott: Oh, OK.

36
00:02:03,435 --> 00:02:06,004
Rym: So I'd be like, yeah, she made you whatever different names of fish.

37
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:06,667
Rym: I got this.

38
00:02:08,453 --> 00:02:08,633
Scott: Yeah.

39
00:02:08,674 --> 00:02:09,638
Scott: Fish is pretty good down there.

40
00:02:09,698 --> 00:02:10,139
Scott: Yeah.

41
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,084
Rym: Fish was pretty good down there.

42
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:11,627
Scott: Nice.

43
00:02:11,787 --> 00:02:12,290
Scott: All right.

44
00:02:12,712 --> 00:02:13,335
Rym: So, yeah, I'm back.

45
00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:15,766
Rym: Regular schedule until PAX and then fuck.

46
00:02:15,806 --> 00:02:16,329
Rym: There's going to be.

47
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:17,555
Rym: I don't know what's going to happen.

48
00:02:18,278 --> 00:02:20,890
Rym: We're going to be gone collectively for like three weeks.

49
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:21,252
Scott: Yeah.

50
00:02:21,734 --> 00:02:25,769
Scott: So remember, I talked a whole lot about my new computer and your tiny God.

51
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:26,432
Rym: Yeah.

52
00:02:26,793 --> 00:02:36,340
Scott: Let me tell you, I don't want to go on for a hundred years about it, but I've never bought a computer before in my life that was so powerful relative to what is available on the market.

53
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,631
Rym: Scott, when I bought this computer, it was that.

54
00:02:38,711 --> 00:02:40,100
Rym: So I know exactly how you feel.

55
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,660
Scott: It is like I can do anything and it's like I bought this stupid Adobe Creative Cloud.

56
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,743
Scott: So now I can do.

57
00:02:45,763 --> 00:02:50,480
Scott: I feel like I can make any things that I can imagine I can make it.

58
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:57,025
Rym: It is a powerful moment when you drag an hour long, like 1080p 60 video into Premiere and it's like, boop.

59
00:02:57,368 --> 00:02:57,570
Scott: Yeah.

60
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,780
Scott: And it's even crazier.

61
00:02:59,001 --> 00:03:13,900
Scott: So it's like I'll have everything open that I usually have open and I'll have like Premiere rendering a video and I'll have like Lightroom organizing photo and iTunes importing all these MP3s and full screen 3D game Mac settings.

62
00:03:15,444 --> 00:03:16,640
Scott: And there's no slow down.

63
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,744
Scott: The fans don't even get.

64
00:03:17,925 --> 00:03:28,557
Rym: My how times have changed because I remember at RIT, because remember when we first all met, you know, there's the cycle of who has the baddest as computer at any given time among a group of the E.P.

65
00:03:28,618 --> 00:03:29,020
Scott: competition.

66
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,877
Rym: When we all got to RIT, that was me because I spent every bond.

67
00:03:32,917 --> 00:03:39,000
Rym: my grandparents had bought me for 19 years on a computer right before I went to RIT.

68
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,300
Scott: Mine was a Pentium 3450.

69
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:41,482
Scott: Yeah.

70
00:03:41,502 --> 00:03:43,056
Rym: Mine was an AMD like K7.

71
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:44,304
Scott: All right.

72
00:03:44,365 --> 00:03:46,880
Scott: We switched to AMD and they kept breaking.

73
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,660
Scott: We kept upgrading and breaking and upgrading.

74
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,979
Scott: Yeah, because then I upgraded to the Thunderbird gigahertz.

75
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,361
Scott: Yeah.

76
00:03:52,381 --> 00:03:57,018
Scott: It's another thing I want to say, right, is, you know, there are still people out there I realize that are all AMD ish.

77
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,630
Scott: And, you know, I looked at AMD and it's like, yeah, you can get like a six core AMD for 100 bucks.

78
00:04:01,651 --> 00:04:02,118
Scott: It's like, whoa.

79
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,799
Rym: At the really low end or not the really low end, but at the at the not like plateau of performance, AMD is still way cheaper.

80
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,201
Scott: Yeah.

81
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:12,360
Scott: But the thing is, you know, I first had it in Pentium three.

82
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,599
Scott: It was my first computer I built.

83
00:04:14,183 --> 00:04:15,838
Scott: And that computer never had a problem ever.

84
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,043
Rym: Simpler anecdote.

85
00:04:18,745 --> 00:04:22,180
Rym: Every Intel computer I've ever built booted on the first try.

86
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,300
Rym: No AMD computer I've ever built booted on the first try.

87
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:36,619
Rym: We built AMD computers from like all through the Pentium four years up until the core two, which was always like me, Scott and a bunch of the other crew standing around a computer being like, why won't it boot?

88
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:37,263
Scott: Yeah.

89
00:04:37,283 --> 00:04:40,180
Scott: Well, I guess we have many like AMD CPUs.

90
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,020
Scott: Did we have lying around extra motherboards?

91
00:04:43,402 --> 00:04:44,917
Rym: I still have all those AMD CPUs.

92
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:45,701
Scott: Right.

93
00:04:45,742 --> 00:04:46,979
Scott: We had all this stuff lying around.

94
00:04:47,101 --> 00:04:47,505
Scott: Why?

95
00:04:47,586 --> 00:04:49,040
Scott: Because the shit kept breaking.

96
00:04:49,161 --> 00:04:51,880
Scott: So now I'm sure AMD might be just fine now.

97
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,380
Rym: And Intel, to be fair, the shit that broke wasn't the CPUs.

98
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,308
Rym: It was always the.

99
00:04:56,328 --> 00:04:57,337
Scott: I had a bad CPU.

100
00:04:58,403 --> 00:04:59,147
Rym: I never, never.

101
00:04:59,327 --> 00:05:02,823
Rym: But anyway, the point is that it was always those jank ass a bit motherboards.

102
00:05:02,883 --> 00:05:07,101
Scott: Well, the general the first the Pentium motherboard, the first one ahead was a bit.

103
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:07,663
Scott: It was perfect.

104
00:05:07,844 --> 00:05:13,840
Rym: The thing is around that era is when I was getting like, let's overclock it a bit like super mother.

105
00:05:13,901 --> 00:05:14,880
Scott: I didn't even overclock.

106
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:18,620
Scott: But all those AMD years shit broke.

107
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,819
Scott: The whole AMD ecosystem of hardware was not reliable in those years for us.

108
00:05:24,721 --> 00:05:28,780
Scott: And every Intel computer I've had has been 100 percent stable.

109
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,460
Scott: My first one, Pentium three was stable.

110
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,580
Scott: The core two duo that I just replaced is still in great condition.

111
00:05:33,702 --> 00:05:35,079
Scott: If you want it, contact me.

112
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,240
Rym: I also have a core two duo that you can have.

113
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,740
Scott: However, and the new one I just bought booted on the first try.

114
00:05:39,902 --> 00:05:40,328
Scott: Perfect.

115
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:41,120
Scott: Everything amazing.

116
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,719
Rym: There's something wrong with that motherboard because USB will occasionally cause it to voltage drop and hard crash.

117
00:05:47,743 --> 00:05:49,240
Scott: Anyway, anyway.

118
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:49,741
Scott: Oh, yeah.

119
00:05:49,801 --> 00:05:58,180
Scott: And having two of the Dell ultra sharp monitors to on arms is pretty sick.

120
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:00,042
Scott: Yeah.

121
00:06:00,323 --> 00:06:06,369
Rym: So if you want my old monitors this past weekend, you may know that we know many people who work at MUSE games.

122
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:11,460
Rym: like a whole bunch of our friends work there and they're working on a new game is Guns of Icarus online.

123
00:06:12,241 --> 00:06:18,780
Rym: There's been a beta for a while and I was in it, but I played it for real over the weekend because it's getting to the point of like being good.

124
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,725
Rym: You can actually play it.

125
00:06:20,228 --> 00:06:22,520
Rym: And it was actually really fun.

126
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,260
Rym: Emily was like, come on, play my game, try it out.

127
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,020
Rym: I'm like, OK, I'll stop playing Counter-Strike and play this new game.

128
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:34,534
Rym: And it's no slight to Guns of Icarus because it is hard to give it to me to play any game that is in Counter-Strike.

129
00:06:34,737 --> 00:06:34,879
Rym: Yeah.

130
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:41,148
Rym: So I start to play and then I just kind of kept playing for some hours because it was actually really fun.

131
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:42,179
Scott: There are people playing in.

132
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,084
Rym: Yeah, there were.

133
00:06:43,124 --> 00:06:48,780
Scott: So we were doing like and the network part worked as the most important thing is that, you know, all these indie games, the network shit doesn't work.

134
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,580
Rym: The network should actually work perfectly.

135
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:57,260
Rym: There was glitchy stuff in the game, but it was the kind of like game balance, game mechanic glitchiness that you expect from a beta.

136
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,099
Scott: Not like, oops, I walked through the wall.

137
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,440
Scott: Oops, I fell off the well.

138
00:07:00,841 --> 00:07:04,260
Rym: At one point I fell off a ship and instead of dying, I just kept falling forever.

139
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:04,803
Scott: Nice.

140
00:07:05,307 --> 00:07:06,940
Rym: But mostly it worked.

141
00:07:07,081 --> 00:07:09,560
Rym: And the game is actually super fun.

142
00:07:09,781 --> 00:07:12,180
Rym: And me and Adam ended up being on a ship at one point.

143
00:07:12,802 --> 00:07:14,639
Rym: And here's why this game is actually fun.

144
00:07:15,142 --> 00:07:22,659
Rym: Like the whole gist of it is that you'll have multiple ships, like two ships per team, and each ship has like four or five, a bunch of people on it.

145
00:07:23,321 --> 00:07:31,919
Rym: And you run around FPS style on the ship, repairing stuff, Team Fortress 2 style and like manning guns and someone's and someone's the captain and they're steering it.

146
00:07:32,361 --> 00:07:35,239
Rym: And the steering feels like this kind of like steampunk thing.

147
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:41,941
Rym: The steering and the logistics and the teamwork and all that stuff actually matters a lot.

148
00:07:42,925 --> 00:07:46,860
Rym: Like at one point, Adam was the captain on my ship.

149
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:54,039
Rym: And, you know, it's like when we play Counter-Strike, if two people who know what the fuck they're doing in games are on the same team in a game, shit goes down.

150
00:07:55,045 --> 00:07:56,040
Rym: And yeah, shit went down.

151
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,482
Rym: Adam was like, they're coming up on the left and he's pulling maneuvers through the smoke.

152
00:07:59,784 --> 00:08:04,004
Rym: We'd like get into the smoke and then reappear behind someone suddenly and just open up a broadside.

153
00:08:04,044 --> 00:08:08,279
Rym: It was the game was surprisingly fun for a still beta game.

154
00:08:08,963 --> 00:08:09,184
Scott: Mm hmm.

155
00:08:09,707 --> 00:08:11,880
Rym: So that's my initial geek bite.

156
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:18,197
Rym: And I'm going to do a more thorough geek bite once I play the game a little more and possibly play it against strangers instead of with someone I know.

157
00:08:20,362 --> 00:08:23,320
Rym: Adam, you're a good captain, but don't use that.

158
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:23,982
Rym: There's this thing.

159
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:27,863
Rym: you can use that like speeds up your ship, but it also ruins your engines.

160
00:08:28,004 --> 00:08:29,819
Rym: And I think he turned it on and forgot to turn it off.

161
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:31,208
Scott: So it's not like.

162
00:08:31,288 --> 00:08:32,580
Scott: it's not like a one time burst.

163
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,359
Scott: It's like a lever that you put in one of two.

164
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:40,240
Rym: It's basically like poor moonshine into the engine and you get like 300 percent speed, but then the engine takes damage.

165
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:40,921
Scott: All right.

166
00:08:41,102 --> 00:08:43,635
Scott: But you just kept the moonshine was just flowing like water.

167
00:08:44,842 --> 00:08:46,619
Rym: OK, I guess like you didn't run out of it.

168
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,658
Scott: I mean, it takes a while.

169
00:08:48,222 --> 00:08:50,080
Rym: Well, the engines all exploded.

170
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,195
Scott: How many X was it?

171
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,480
Rym: Three X's on the bottle.

172
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:53,882
Scott: Yeah.

173
00:08:53,902 --> 00:08:56,180
Scott: You know, we learned the X is on the moonshine bottle.

174
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,939
Scott: That's how many times it's been through the still.

175
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,965
Scott: Every time you put it through the still, you put another X. That's when.

176
00:09:00,985 --> 00:09:01,207
Scott: Yeah.

177
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:01,975
Scott: Anyway, there you go.

178
00:09:03,261 --> 00:09:03,624
Rym: All right.

179
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:05,660
Scott: Or, you know, so let's just do some news here.

180
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,200
Scott: Let's not blow our whole load that we have plenty to talk about in future episodes.

181
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:13,079
Rym: So I'm always conflicted when a company I hate sues another company I hate.

182
00:09:14,681 --> 00:09:27,520
Scott: And well, the thing is, usually when that happens and this hasn't been happening lately, but whenever anyone sues anyone, I mostly just want the court to set the precedent the way that I want, because I want what I want.

183
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:34,320
Rym: Well, well, there's two things or I or if it's people I hate, I want them to do as much damage to each other as possible.

184
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,284
Scott: That's also true.

185
00:09:36,127 --> 00:09:38,679
Scott: But so when it's two people, you hate you anyway.

186
00:09:39,603 --> 00:09:40,959
Scott: So what's what's going on?

187
00:09:41,241 --> 00:09:42,979
Rym: EA has sued Zynga.

188
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:43,923
Scott: Well, Zynga.

189
00:09:43,963 --> 00:09:46,520
Scott: I mean, I hate EA, but Zynga is worse.

190
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,280
Rym: Well, EA is just kind of, you know, exploiting their workers, making generic.

191
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,042
Scott: Well, they already got sued for exploiting their workers and they supposedly fix that, I guess.

192
00:09:57,102 --> 00:09:59,820
Rym: The video game industry is fucked when it comes to worker treatment.

193
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,895
Rym: That's a separate union.

194
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,320
Rym: But EA, you know, they're like the Microsoft of the gaming world.

195
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:05,801
Scott: Yeah.

196
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:07,700
Rym: Microsoft in the 90s to nerds.

197
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,239
Rym: Anyway, Zynga.

198
00:10:10,523 --> 00:10:11,940
Rym: Well, no, they're not a game company.

199
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,018
Rym: Zynga doesn't make games.

200
00:10:13,843 --> 00:10:14,959
Rym: I've said that on lectures.

201
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:16,050
Rym: I've said that at PAX.

202
00:10:16,071 --> 00:10:16,980
Rym: I've said it on the shelves later.

203
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,520
Rym: Zynga does not make anything that competes with what I would call a game.

204
00:10:21,941 --> 00:10:27,646
Rym: They make games in the same way that patty cake is a game, but in replace patty cake with patty.

205
00:10:27,726 --> 00:10:29,479
Rym: And then you got to put a quarter in to get the cakes.

206
00:10:32,142 --> 00:10:35,840
Rym: So EA is suing Zynga over copyright infringement.

207
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:47,360
Rym: And this is where things get weird, because if you don't know game mechanics, game rules, things like that, not copyrightable at all.

208
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:47,761
Rym: You can.

209
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:52,401
Rym: There is so much precedent for you not being able to copyright the rules of a game.

210
00:10:52,482 --> 00:10:52,603
Scott: Right.

211
00:10:52,623 --> 00:10:54,360
Scott: You don't copyright rules of a game.

212
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,810
Scott: You copyright, you know, art work or music.

213
00:10:59,361 --> 00:11:03,500
Rym: A specific, like, for example, a drawing, a music, a background.

214
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,460
Scott: Yeah, that's artworks are copyrighted.

215
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,160
Scott: You know, something like game mechanics would be an invention.

216
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,063
Scott: They'd be patented.

217
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:15,880
Scott: And even then it's very your logo of your company or the logo and name of your game trademark.

218
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:24,443
Rym: So you can't sue someone and win by all the legal precedent we who are not lawyers know of.

219
00:11:25,008 --> 00:11:26,400
Rym: And I read like 10 articles.

220
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:26,942
Rym: Well, you could.

221
00:11:27,003 --> 00:11:33,980
Scott: What if I made an FPS that used like all the sprites from Doom, but you didn't let me finish based on game mechanics.

222
00:11:34,241 --> 00:11:34,743
Scott: Of course not.

223
00:11:34,803 --> 00:11:44,222
Rym: And every time there's been a lawsuit that worked about someone stealing a game, it's always been like, yeah, they stole all the backgrounds from Morrowind or something like that.

224
00:11:44,844 --> 00:11:54,419
Rym: But in this case, no, EA is suing over a game because it's mechanically and stylistically similar to their game.

225
00:11:55,124 --> 00:11:57,200
Scott: Well, did their lawyers be smart?

226
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:02,500
Scott: I don't know what's going on because I mean, like, how could we know more than people who are lawyers 24/7?

227
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:09,217
Rym: So what's interesting is that the mainstream media, like Wall Street Journal type news organizations are saying the same thing.

228
00:12:09,237 --> 00:12:09,660
Rym: we're saying.

229
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,740
Rym: They're like, what the fuck is EA doing?

230
00:12:11,841 --> 00:12:12,919
Rym: You can't sue for that.

231
00:12:13,281 --> 00:12:14,780
Rym: That's not even covered by the law.

232
00:12:14,841 --> 00:12:15,774
Rym: That's crazy.

233
00:12:16,098 --> 00:12:16,220
Scott: Yeah.

234
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,479
Scott: I mean, look at around the world.

235
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:26,160
Scott: This is why you can see a lot of like Monopoly clones out there, but you just can't call it something like Opoly because you'll get trademark sued.

236
00:12:26,642 --> 00:12:32,067
Scott: But if you just call it like the Scott game, but it looks just like Monopoly and it plays like Monopoly, how many people.

237
00:12:32,087 --> 00:12:37,880
Scott: it doesn't have Monopoly man on it and doesn't use like Baltic, you know, those names as different names and different colors.

238
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:42,660
Rym: How many people have taken that old mafia slash werewolf game and remade it?

239
00:12:42,823 --> 00:12:43,699
Rym: I'm doing it even.

240
00:12:43,961 --> 00:12:46,619
Rym: Yeah, it's not you can't copyright that.

241
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:55,460
Rym: But so every article I've read has had a quote from a lawyer or an analyst or someone who basically said, what the fuck is EA doing?

242
00:12:55,581 --> 00:12:56,899
Rym: This is a ludicrous lawsuit.

243
00:12:57,161 --> 00:13:02,100
Rym: Yeah, but they've always qualified it by saying not that Zynga is a good company.

244
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:06,560
Scott: Well, because I mean, you got to think Zynga basically does just clone all the games.

245
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,179
Scott: They see someone else, a successful game.

246
00:13:08,582 --> 00:13:12,120
Scott: They make the same exact game thing as a team in the mighty.

247
00:13:12,461 --> 00:13:15,918
Rym: Then they're not breaking the rules, but they're still.

248
00:13:15,998 --> 00:13:16,420
Scott: they take.

249
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,739
Scott: They see a game that's successful.

250
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,460
Scott: They directly copy it and Zynga if I and tweak it slightly.

251
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,751
Scott: So they make it time to make it to make do.

252
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,861
Rym: every time I click, it's nine ninety five to you.

253
00:13:27,881 --> 00:13:28,344
Scott: That's right.

254
00:13:28,364 --> 00:13:31,220
Scott: And then they stick it on Facebook and iPhone and whatnot.

255
00:13:31,481 --> 00:13:32,083
Scott: And that's that.

256
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,040
Scott: So, yeah, they're not exactly, you know, the bestest.

257
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:43,799
Scott: I mean, imagine if we just made a game that was the same game as Puerto Rico, but we called it GeekNights, Rico, and we changed all the artworks and all the things legally.

258
00:13:43,981 --> 00:13:44,486
Rym: That's fine.

259
00:13:44,587 --> 00:13:45,920
Rym: Morally gray area.

260
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:57,439
Scott: But if we put that out, you know, we would be punished in the marketplace because anyone in that marketplace would know, hey, this is a Puerto Rico clone and no one would buy it up unless we made it online and easy to play.

261
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,820
Scott: Well, actually, I was thinking, right, what if we did that evilly?

262
00:14:02,161 --> 00:14:02,482
Scott: Right.

263
00:14:03,165 --> 00:14:10,500
Scott: And what we did is we basically just made the board game versions, the physical versions with very low production values, but still playable.

264
00:14:10,661 --> 00:14:11,807
Scott: And we made them way cheaper.

265
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:14,826
Scott: So it's like Puerto Rico, 10 bucks because it's a cheap ass version.

266
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:16,179
Scott: But it's not called Puerto Rico.

267
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,598
Scott: It's GeekNights, whatnot.

268
00:14:18,861 --> 00:14:24,380
Rym: That'd be on the morally gray, shitty business practice level of the stuff Zinga does.

269
00:14:24,681 --> 00:14:25,108
Scott: But legal.

270
00:14:25,128 --> 00:14:25,595
Scott: Yeah.

271
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:26,666
Rym: And you know what?

272
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,580
Rym: In my opinion, not a lawyer.

273
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,100
Rym: Everything Zinga is doing here is pretty legal.

274
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,627
Scott: There's nothing.

275
00:14:32,668 --> 00:14:34,700
Scott: The thing is, right, is lawsuit is groundless.

276
00:14:34,921 --> 00:14:36,140
Scott: They is currently legal.

277
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:41,040
Scott: But I'm actually I'm not sure my opinion.

278
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:52,040
Rym: Scott, if you're OK with copywriting game mechanics and you're OK with a much deeper copyright ability of things like I am considering making my opinion.

279
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,460
Scott: I'm not saying this is my current.

280
00:14:53,821 --> 00:14:54,487
Rym: All right.

281
00:14:54,507 --> 00:14:55,920
Rym: You realize my hackles are up.

282
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:05,929
Scott: I'm ready to argue here that Zinga like games are so basically they're gambling and should be regulated as such, even though.

283
00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:12,060
Scott: because imagine if I made a slot machine, but the slot machine had a guaranteed payout of zero, but you had to pay a quarter.

284
00:15:12,421 --> 00:15:13,186
Scott: You pulled the lever.

285
00:15:13,749 --> 00:15:14,151
Rym: I'm just going to.

286
00:15:14,172 --> 00:15:16,619
Rym: I'll play the devil's advocate because we should do a separate show on this.

287
00:15:17,281 --> 00:15:17,783
Rym: Wait a minute.

288
00:15:18,024 --> 00:15:22,021
Rym: We're going to be talking about this at both Pax Prime and Pax Dev on two different.

289
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:32,540
Scott: I'm feeling like, you know, that's like even, you know, solitaire blitz is kind of fun from PopCap, but I'm feeling like it's just an evil slot machine and sort of shouldn't maybe shouldn't be.

290
00:15:32,821 --> 00:15:34,005
Rym: I'm not sure.

291
00:15:34,105 --> 00:15:39,880
Scott: I'm considering changing my opinion that it shouldn't be an argument to be considered or at least should be regulated.

292
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,167
Rym: That's we.

293
00:15:41,671 --> 00:15:42,840
Rym: free speech is number one.

294
00:15:43,383 --> 00:15:44,135
Scott: I agree.

295
00:15:44,156 --> 00:15:44,420
Scott: I know.

296
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,844
Scott: That's why I'm only considering.

297
00:15:45,864 --> 00:15:50,820
Rym: because are we going to say that a game is no longer free?

298
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:58,841
Rym: speech is speech when movies, books, pictographs, drawings, music, everything else is free speech.

299
00:15:58,861 --> 00:16:08,840
Scott: But a game is can also because of what it is, right, because it is a thing that you do and not just the thing you experience gambling be regulated.

300
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,319
Scott: That is a good question.

301
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:13,268
Scott: And also sort of why does it?

302
00:16:13,549 --> 00:16:16,540
Rym: why does gambling matter if there's no payout?

303
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:29,960
Rym: The only reason you regulate gambling is to make sure that at least the people who do gamble don't get fucked by an unregulated, but it's also to make sure, but it's also to make sure that the casino doesn't cheat the people.

304
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:35,939
Rym: That's what I'm saying, to make sure that that there's not some unregulated market where the consumers don't know what they're buying.

305
00:16:36,921 --> 00:16:42,840
Rym: But games like this, like these crappy social league games, I feel like social game is code for a shit game at this point.

306
00:16:43,621 --> 00:16:52,143
Rym: Well, yeah, but I do those games not tell you exactly what they're doing, not 100 percent of the time.

307
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:59,820
Scott: They don't necessarily tell you, like all the mechanics of the game, like, yeah, this thing gives you 100 percent chance of this happening within five hours.

308
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,180
Rym: So, Scott, if we regulate those games, what's the line?

309
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:07,079
Rym: Does Half-Life have to tell you how many points of damage the new gun does?

310
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,224
Scott: I don't know.

311
00:17:08,326 --> 00:17:10,339
Scott: That's why I'm only considering.

312
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,165
Scott: Yeah, but there's still some.

313
00:17:12,226 --> 00:17:14,720
Scott: I mean, it is sort of a man trap, right?

314
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:17,460
Scott: It's like certain kinds of advertising are illegal.

315
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:26,433
Rym: Only only advertising that is actually directly false or because of weird regulations, cigarette ads.

316
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:32,020
Scott: Well, yeah, but I mean, like, you know, subliminal advertising, even though it doesn't work, is illegal.

317
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:41,060
Rym: But that was made illegal under a very shady, it was and would probably not stand up in court if it was challenged.

318
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:41,884
Scott: But it doesn't work.

319
00:17:41,964 --> 00:17:46,800
Rym: But imagine that because it now I'm saying one, because it doesn't work, it wouldn't stand up in court.

320
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,582
Rym: I don't believe.

321
00:17:47,903 --> 00:17:51,913
Rym: And two, OK, even if it did work, would it be?

322
00:17:52,013 --> 00:17:55,283
Rym: would it really be fair to regulate it?

323
00:17:55,545 --> 00:17:58,860
Rym: Because what if I wrote a novel that's subliminal?

324
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:05,240
Scott: Let's not waste the whole episode on this, but I'm going to ask one question and then we will not answer it and then we'll move on.

325
00:18:05,481 --> 00:18:06,680
Rym: OK, and then I'll ask another question.

326
00:18:07,422 --> 00:18:09,520
Scott: No, no, no question is like my question.

327
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:15,340
Scott: If I invented a mind control device, would should it be legal?

328
00:18:16,603 --> 00:18:17,192
Scott: That's the question.

329
00:18:17,232 --> 00:18:17,719
Scott: Don't answer it.

330
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,382
Scott: Let's just move on.

331
00:18:18,503 --> 00:18:22,880
Rym: So my question is, do we care if Zynga gets fucked or not?

332
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:23,581
Scott: No.

333
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:27,259
Rym: So here's here's my personal read on this.

334
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:38,119
Rym: I think what EA is trying to do here is get a precedent set to change the way these things work in the courts.

335
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:46,500
Rym: I think EA is going to try to use its muscle to get the court to argue or to agree that certain aspects of game mechanics are copyrightable.

336
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:52,900
Rym: And regardless of whether or not you think this lawsuit has merit, because again, Zynga basically steals stuff for all intents and purposes.

337
00:18:54,561 --> 00:19:03,400
Rym: If EA wins this lawsuit, the the ramifications for game design and gameplay are staggering and almost universally bad.

338
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:08,720
Rym: Well, the thing that we're not want to win this this is like someone sues Hitler.

339
00:19:09,225 --> 00:19:10,699
Rym: We don't want Hitler to win.

340
00:19:11,382 --> 00:19:14,740
Rym: But if the lawsuit passes, then video games get banned.

341
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:22,060
Scott: Well, here's the thing, right, is that a lot of these cases lately, the people have been pushing jury trials, you know, juries to decide.

342
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:23,439
Rym: That's bad news.

343
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:36,236
Scott: And if a jury looks at pictures of EA's games, sees evidence that those games were released on the market first and then sees pictures of Zynga's games, which look basically identical, 99 percent identical, it's not going to.

344
00:19:36,357 --> 00:19:40,299
Scott: it's going to be hard to convince the jury that Zynga wasn't just ripping them off.

345
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,560
Scott: But at the same time, the jury is not going to want to decide in Zynga's favor.

346
00:19:43,841 --> 00:19:46,120
Rym: But at the same time, then the appeals would look more.

347
00:19:46,441 --> 00:19:49,300
Scott: It's up to the judge to give the jury the correct instructions.

348
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:55,980
Rym: No, I'm saying even if a jury trial happened on appeal, it would probably end up getting into a precedent's argument and that sort of stuff.

349
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,146
Scott: That'd be good because.

350
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,340
Rym: Yeah, but that's the news there.

351
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:03,940
Rym: I don't want to get a win, but I don't want to win either.

352
00:20:04,321 --> 00:20:09,361
Rym: So I'm hoping that Zynga exhausts money defending against this wins, but then goes out of business.

353
00:20:15,551 --> 00:20:25,144
Rym: But anyway, things of the day, there's been a sort of hobby on the Internet for a while now, and it's kind of gained some steam recently because more people were doing it.

354
00:20:25,204 --> 00:20:32,378
Rym: We linked to things about this a while ago, but trying to play modern games with really low settings just to see what they look like and do this.

355
00:20:33,301 --> 00:20:33,825
Rym: Yeah, you did.

356
00:20:33,925 --> 00:20:35,940
Rym: So this one goes a step further.

357
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:42,024
Rym: This is a dude who didn't just set the kind of like in the menu settings down on Half-Life 2.

358
00:20:42,024 --> 00:20:48,980
Rym: He went and changed all the variables to make Half-Life 2 be as minimal as goddamn possible.

359
00:20:49,981 --> 00:21:01,380
Rym: And let me tell you, this looks a lot like Quake one, and it's actually kind of amazing to see how the game is still pretty playable and things are still pretty recognizable.

360
00:21:02,783 --> 00:21:03,860
Scott: Only because you played it before.

361
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,140
Rym: Even then, I could play this because it's yeah.

362
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,540
Scott: No, you forget on paper is playing Scott.

363
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,247
Rym: When was the last time you played Doom?

364
00:21:11,267 --> 00:21:15,164
Rym: and it was not one of these Doom remakes with a higher resolution?

365
00:21:15,405 --> 00:21:19,304
Scott: I played the Doom remake with a higher resolution, but I didn't enable the higher resolution.

366
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,434
Scott: So it still looked like Doomdoom looked like.

367
00:21:21,455 --> 00:21:24,160
Rym: I can't even comprehend Doomdoom anymore.

368
00:21:24,402 --> 00:21:24,684
Scott: I can.

369
00:21:24,906 --> 00:21:26,360
Rym: My brain is like, what the fuck is that?

370
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,456
Rym: And I turn the resolution up.

371
00:21:28,823 --> 00:21:30,799
Rym: But anyway, this is actually pretty entertaining to watch.

372
00:21:31,701 --> 00:21:37,939
Rym: Also, you should totally comment on the guy's video and tell him how amazing it is that it looks just like Minecraft, just like everyone does.

373
00:21:38,141 --> 00:21:39,046
Rym: Yeah, he has an annotation.

374
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:41,160
Rym: He's like, guys, stop telling me it looks like Minecraft.

375
00:21:41,423 --> 00:21:42,699
Rym: I get an email for every comment.

376
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,443
Rym: I don't care.

377
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:46,840
Scott: So you could turn that off if you wanted to.

378
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,125
Scott: Yeah.

379
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:54,100
Scott: Anyway, anyway, so, you know, I just bought a new computer and it has a sound card in it, but the sound card is part of the motherboard.

380
00:21:54,361 --> 00:22:04,167
Scott: And pretty much every sound card these days pretty much just plays digital audio perfectly, as many digital audios as you want just to speakers, just like your iPhone or whatever, like a stereo.

381
00:22:04,187 --> 00:22:05,660
Scott: It's they're pretty much perfect.

382
00:22:05,921 --> 00:22:06,750
Scott: They're all the same.

383
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:07,780
Scott: They don't really matter.

384
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,540
Scott: They all follow the same Intel AC 97 standard thing.

385
00:22:11,681 --> 00:22:13,460
Scott: They all you know, there's no friggin difference.

386
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,526
Scott: You don't even think about it.

387
00:22:14,828 --> 00:22:16,600
Scott: You just your computer can play any sound.

388
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,082
Scott: There is.

389
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:17,142
Scott: no.

390
00:22:17,864 --> 00:22:19,008
Rym: I remember a day.

391
00:22:19,028 --> 00:22:22,983
Scott: I remember a day back in the day, computers couldn't play any sound.

392
00:22:23,023 --> 00:22:24,208
Scott: There was they didn't.

393
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:28,959
Scott: you didn't have enough memory and processing power to actually play digital audio.

394
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,600
Rym: Most games had MIDI soundtracks or some equivalent.

395
00:22:31,902 --> 00:22:33,540
Rym: And even then, it sounded way different.

396
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,742
Rym: If you had an all 32, it sounded way different than if you had like a regular sound blaster.

397
00:22:38,783 --> 00:22:41,840
Scott: or basically, you know, computers today have digital audio.

398
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,794
Scott: You have the audio in a file like an MP3 or an AUG.

399
00:22:44,854 --> 00:22:46,120
Scott: that is just the waveform.

400
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:54,040
Scott: And then the computer plays it back by converting that digital data into an analog audio signal and sending it to a speaker.

401
00:22:54,622 --> 00:23:02,200
Scott: In the olden days, you couldn't store that or process that digital thing and convert it to analog quickly enough or have enough memory to hold on to it.

402
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,339
Scott: So you couldn't do it that way.

403
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:11,285
Scott: You could have analog audio like a vinyl record or cassette tape and just play it back with a player.

404
00:23:11,405 --> 00:23:18,420
Scott: But you would have to somehow control the cassette player, have the computer control the play and pause buttons, the cassette player and rewind.

405
00:23:18,821 --> 00:23:20,239
Scott: And I don't think anyone ever even did that.

406
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,500
Rym: Remember, even like not that long ago, PlayStation one games, Redbook audio.

407
00:23:24,841 --> 00:23:25,965
Scott: Yeah.

408
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:31,789
Scott: So the very first computers for audio, all they had was a PC speaker that basically went beep boop and it had.

409
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,359
Scott: basically it was like a buzzer and you like a doorbell and you could friggin ring it.

410
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,459
Scott: And that was pretty much it.

411
00:23:36,801 --> 00:23:38,320
Rym: I remember installing old games.

412
00:23:38,661 --> 00:23:47,660
Rym: One of the things you had to do is set the IRQ and DMA stuff for your sound card and you had to pick like, do you have an ad lib or the Roland, whatever.

413
00:23:48,241 --> 00:23:52,399
Scott: So over the years, what you know, they had sound cards and what sound cards were.

414
00:23:52,821 --> 00:23:55,640
Scott: And your computer still has one of these in it somewhere, even though it's not used.

415
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,560
Rym: It's just on the motherboard.

416
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,163
Rym: Right.

417
00:23:57,284 --> 00:23:59,420
Scott: It's basically a synthesizer.

418
00:23:59,861 --> 00:24:05,920
Scott: So it was like you have an instrument, a keyboard, like a Casio keyboard synthesizer built into the computer.

419
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:13,720
Scott: And the computer, the game basically has, you know, a musical track and then plays the sound card like it's a keyboard.

420
00:24:14,223 --> 00:24:16,620
Scott: And that's how your computer would make music with a sound card.

421
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,760
Scott: And because of that, you know, different synthesizers sound different.

422
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:24,479
Scott: So different computers sounded different and had different capabilities and could play more noises at once.

423
00:24:24,761 --> 00:24:28,440
Scott: And this is how the NES made music and how the SNES made music even.

424
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:28,741
Scott: Right.

425
00:24:28,781 --> 00:24:34,360
Scott: It was all these old computers had synthesizers in them that the games, the software played.

426
00:24:34,642 --> 00:24:36,720
Scott: So the software is playing a digital instrument.

427
00:24:37,322 --> 00:24:48,782
Scott: So this guy wrote this amazing article here that is called The History of Sound Cards in Computer Game Music, and he covers the PC speaker, the IBM PC, Jr.

428
00:24:48,823 --> 00:24:55,524
Scott: and Tandy, the Adlib, the Roland, the Creative Game Blaster, the Sound Blaster, the I had.

429
00:24:55,906 --> 00:24:58,520
Rym: my first sound card was this like integrated way.

430
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:58,841
Scott: Hold on.

431
00:24:59,142 --> 00:25:06,480
Scott: Roland sound canvas, Gravis ultrasound, Creative Lab, Sound Blaster 16, R32 and then modern sound cards.

432
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,279
Scott: And he has audio samples from all of these.

433
00:25:08,661 --> 00:25:16,120
Scott: And the best part was that he got audio samples from this game, Silpheed, which is really old shooter, but he has like Silpheed.

434
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,653
Scott: He has samples from it, from PC speaker, PC, Jr.

435
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,682
Scott: Adlib.

436
00:25:20,883 --> 00:25:26,780
Scott: He's got Silpheed running on like six or seven different cards here, or maybe five or six with the same exact music.

437
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,939
Scott: And it's like, whoa, you can totally hear, you know, what's going on.

438
00:25:30,802 --> 00:25:35,063
Scott: The other thing is he kind of left out like he has the music from Descent and Descent 2.

439
00:25:35,063 --> 00:25:40,239
Scott: But what he left out was the fact that the Descent and Descent 2 were on CD-ROMs and had Redbook audio.

440
00:25:40,822 --> 00:25:45,241
Scott: So what those would do is even that was you would put Descent in and you start playing it.

441
00:25:45,602 --> 00:25:57,043
Scott: And if you had a modern sound card with the CD-ROM had a little cable that ran from the CD-ROM to the sound card and basically play the music straight off the CD like a CD player.

442
00:25:57,063 --> 00:25:58,820
Scott: So you had a real music with those games.

443
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,160
Scott: But he's not giving you that music.

444
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:07,200
Scott: He's giving you the synthesized music from Descent and Descent 2 for people who didn't have CD-ROMs or CD-ROMs hooked up properly.

445
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:14,140
Rym: I remember the one when I finally give us my dad to buy me a Sound Blaster AWE 32, the AWE 32.

446
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,180
Scott: He's also got a lot of Quest for Glory clips here for Rym.

447
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,120
Rym: Quest for Glory had some great sound.

448
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,240
Scott: Also, let me tell you, the Roland sound canvas friggin sounds like amazing.

449
00:26:24,462 --> 00:26:26,120
Scott: It's like this unbelievable synthesizer.

450
00:26:26,725 --> 00:26:27,398
Scott: It's pretty sweet.

451
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:34,000
Rym: So when I installed it, suddenly I heard the Star Wars theme in TIE Fighter.

452
00:26:34,864 --> 00:26:36,180
Rym: In AWE 32.

453
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,439
Scott: Oh, and you had never heard sound before.

454
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,920
Rym: I'd heard it before, but it was on this shit MIDI card.

455
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,118
Rym: So the samples were ass.

456
00:26:41,801 --> 00:26:48,300
Rym: The AWE 32 had really good samples built into it, and it sounded to my young ear like the best music I'd ever heard come out of a computer.

457
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,874
Rym: Yeah, because that was before MP3s.

458
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:57,525
Rym: So in the meta moment, you realize, guys, that we're going to be at PAX Prime and PAX Dev.

459
00:26:57,545 --> 00:26:59,060
Scott: Oh, shit.

460
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,174
Rym: Yeah, PAX Prime, Friday, 3.30 p.m.

461
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,880
Rym: in the Wolfman Theater, short subjects in gaming.

462
00:27:04,663 --> 00:27:10,646
Rym: One of the panel, one of the many panels within that that we're doing is called On the Ethics of Mind Control.

463
00:27:10,726 --> 00:27:13,762
Rym: And we're basically going to have the discussion that Scott and I almost had just now.

464
00:27:14,825 --> 00:27:32,099
Rym: And at PAX Dev, if any of you were going, Scott, myself, Luke Crane, Jared Sorenson, Avery Alex and Conrad Kraling will be doing Academia versus Reality, Psychology Game Theory in Games in the Grand 2 Ballroom, Wednesday, 2.30 p.m All right.

465
00:27:32,503 --> 00:27:34,760
Rym: Asha, son, it's on big time.

466
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,717
Rym: Magfest is a ways out, but we'll be there.

467
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:37,883
Rym: I'll be there.

468
00:27:38,225 --> 00:27:44,880
Scott: Other meta, I just want to say, you know, we I started this GeekNights newsletter and I've actually been mailing it about once every two weeks.

469
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:52,404
Scott: So and in that newsletter, I actually put some moderate amount of work into rewriting it every time.

470
00:27:52,424 --> 00:27:56,340
Scott: I don't know if anyone's actually reading it, but I can sort of see numbers.

471
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,659
Scott: So subscriptions that people keep subscribing to it.

472
00:28:00,363 --> 00:28:03,400
Scott: And there are people who are reading it and people who are clicking on the links in it.

473
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,620
Rym: Remember, there is a unique content exclusive.

474
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:11,720
Scott: There is a small amount of exclusive content in this newsletter.

475
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,560
Rym: There's a newsletter thing of the day that you'll never get on the regular website.

476
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:14,902
Rym: Yeah.

477
00:28:15,002 --> 00:28:17,500
Scott: And there is also a newsletter fan art.

478
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:23,360
Scott: So if you want to submit fan art, you want to submit questions for us to answer in the newsletter, you know, stuff like that.

479
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,940
Scott: We're just trying to increase our listener engagement.

480
00:28:26,441 --> 00:28:28,679
Scott: So newsletter is not a bad place to do that.

481
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:32,140
Scott: Why not subscribe or whatever?

482
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,900
Scott: And then if it sucks, unsubscribe, but at least tell us so that we know how to make it better or whatever.

483
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,976
Rym: OK, so tournaments, obviously the real.

484
00:28:41,016 --> 00:28:41,940
Scott: what is a tournament?

485
00:28:42,823 --> 00:28:44,100
Rym: You want to look up the dictionary definition?

486
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,800
Rym: Because, I mean, a tournament is a thing at a convention that takes way too much time.

487
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,140
Rym: I never do it, even though I know I could win some of these things.

488
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,233
Scott: Well, I mean, to me, what a tournament is, is you want to?

489
00:28:54,374 --> 00:28:58,660
Scott: you want to determine somehow who is the best at a at a particular thing.

490
00:28:58,781 --> 00:29:00,900
Rym: From a limited field of contenders.

491
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,361
Rym: Right.

492
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:10,460
Rym: And simultaneously, I think, equally important to most tournaments is to provide an entertaining spectacle for the people who are sometimes.

493
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,519
Scott: Yes, that's what I'm saying for me.

494
00:29:12,923 --> 00:29:14,560
Rym: Yeah, that is an equally important thing.

495
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:19,100
Scott: I think the purpose of a tournament is that you have some sort of competition and you want to determine who's the best.

496
00:29:19,221 --> 00:29:22,860
Scott: So let's say you wanted to have, you know, a race, you know.

497
00:29:23,381 --> 00:29:27,300
Scott: So, for example, you know, you could say, OK, everyone ready, set, go.

498
00:29:27,441 --> 00:29:29,839
Scott: And then you have one race and whoever gets to the end wins.

499
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,640
Scott: Now, for just a race, that probably is the best way to do it.

500
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,142
Scott: That might work.

501
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:45,299
Scott: But the problem is, is what if the competition is such that only a small number of people can participate or you can't really figure out who's the best in the world with only one iteration of the contest.

502
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,839
Scott: So who's the best at Puerto Rico?

503
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,140
Scott: Well, we got five guys playing.

504
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,146
Scott: A guy wins.

505
00:29:49,771 --> 00:29:50,800
Scott: Is he the best in the world?

506
00:29:51,103 --> 00:29:52,620
Scott: No, only five people played.

507
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,280
Scott: Well, 100 people can't play one game of Puerto Rico.

508
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:56,208
Scott: Of course not.

509
00:29:56,491 --> 00:29:57,320
Scott: That's why you need.

510
00:29:57,882 --> 00:30:02,617
Scott: A tournament, you play multiple iterations of the thing in some structure.

511
00:30:02,999 --> 00:30:06,300
Scott: that will determine a grand champion of the thing.

512
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,778
Scott: And that is what a tournament is for.

513
00:30:08,161 --> 00:30:08,322
Rym: Yeah.

514
00:30:08,402 --> 00:30:14,200
Rym: According to Wikipedia, a tournament is a competition involving a relatively large number of competitors all participating in a sport or game.

515
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,759
Rym: More specifically, the term may be used in either of two overlapping anyway.

516
00:30:18,301 --> 00:30:18,522
Scott: Yeah.

517
00:30:18,762 --> 00:30:29,060
Rym: So the reason we're talking about this, which you should know unless you live under a rock, is that teams in the Olympics were disqualified for trying to win the medal.

518
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:29,881
Rym: Yep.

519
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:32,900
Rym: That is pretty much the most succinct way I can put it.

520
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,686
Scott: So here's the deal.

521
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:35,160
Scott: So they're playing badminton, right?

522
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,220
Scott: Which is actually like bad.

523
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,280
Rym: It's a super fun sport.

524
00:30:38,321 --> 00:30:39,044
Scott: I'm a big fan.

525
00:30:39,084 --> 00:30:48,901
Scott: So the way the tournament was structured was it was a round robin tournament, which means you actually was more like the World Cup where you play in a group.

526
00:30:48,962 --> 00:30:53,681
Scott: So the group like four teams together and those four teams will each play each other.

527
00:30:54,123 --> 00:30:58,062
Scott: And the two, you know, you win or lose against the other three teams in your group.

528
00:30:58,526 --> 00:31:00,040
Scott: So you play three matches, basically.

529
00:31:00,721 --> 00:31:08,720
Scott: And if you win more than the other teams in the group, the top two teams in each group move on and the bottom two teams in each group don't move on.

530
00:31:08,861 --> 00:31:11,160
Scott: So basically you cut the field in half.

531
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,939
Scott: Everyone plays three games.

532
00:31:13,461 --> 00:31:18,199
Scott: Now, this is sort of a good format because, you know, it's like your first game is flukey.

533
00:31:18,661 --> 00:31:22,319
Scott: It gives you some chances to win, even though you lost a game or two.

534
00:31:22,762 --> 00:31:25,495
Scott: If you are actually better, it can also depending on.

535
00:31:25,515 --> 00:31:29,819
Rym: I mean, there's different algorithms for sorting around robin tournaments or deciding who plays who and when.

536
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,260
Rym: You can have round robins where you play multiple games against people.

537
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:38,222
Rym: You can have round robins where you don't actually play against every person if they're very large.

538
00:31:38,262 --> 00:31:51,640
Scott: So it allows you to have a very large field of competitors without having to, you know, really and filter them down quickly down to, you know, so you can get a single elimination tournament afterwards.

539
00:31:51,942 --> 00:31:52,526
Scott: So it's not.

540
00:31:52,607 --> 00:31:54,439
Scott: it's not really bad structure at all.

541
00:31:54,780 --> 00:32:07,380
Rym: Now, the problem lied in that the round robin format format for the Olympics for Bedman was basically to to decide who qualifies for the single elimination real tournament.

542
00:32:08,282 --> 00:32:17,680
Rym: And as a result, because of the way it shook down, as you know, in a single elimination tournament, having a higher or lower seed determines who you play.

543
00:32:17,761 --> 00:32:17,962
Rym: Right.

544
00:32:18,123 --> 00:32:20,840
Rym: And in single elimination, that means, you know, round one.

545
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:21,866
Rym: Me and Scott play.

546
00:32:22,188 --> 00:32:24,040
Rym: whoever loses is out of the tournament.

547
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:32,880
Rym: So we Scott and I way back, you know, we ran an outlaw tournament like Atari twenty six hundred in our apartment and we did a single elimination tournament.

548
00:32:33,381 --> 00:32:42,520
Rym: Now, had Scott and I played against each other in the first round, that would have been BS because we're we were basically the two best players.

549
00:32:42,822 --> 00:32:43,024
Rym: Right.

550
00:32:43,064 --> 00:32:45,200
Rym: But one of the best players would have been eliminated immediately.

551
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:49,020
Scott: So it would have looked as if I sucked because I lost in the first round.

552
00:32:49,161 --> 00:32:52,100
Scott: But in reality, I was the second or first best player.

553
00:32:52,602 --> 00:32:57,099
Scott: You just don't realize that because I played against the other best player in round one.

554
00:32:57,883 --> 00:32:59,660
Scott: So the tournament results.

555
00:33:00,042 --> 00:33:00,203
Scott: Right.

556
00:33:00,304 --> 00:33:03,000
Scott: I would have won the silver medal if the seating would have been different.

557
00:33:03,241 --> 00:33:10,820
Scott: But instead I win dick and bupkis because I played against the gold medal guy in the first match instead of in the finals.

558
00:33:10,941 --> 00:33:16,580
Scott: And that's why you have seating in a in a single elimination tournament so that the final rankings are accurate.

559
00:33:17,221 --> 00:33:21,164
Scott: So, you know, imagine if you played a single elimination tournament, you lost in the first round.

560
00:33:21,244 --> 00:33:25,580
Scott: But you could, you know, if you played against the silver medal guy, you would have destroyed him because you're way better than him.

561
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,544
Scott: Well, that's just wrong.

562
00:33:27,086 --> 00:33:30,742
Scott: So there's seating going on after you play in these group matches.

563
00:33:31,084 --> 00:33:34,862
Scott: They arrange everyone in the single elimination tournament, according to seeds.

564
00:33:34,942 --> 00:33:38,720
Scott: Now they're the best guy plays the worst guy and so forth.

565
00:33:38,841 --> 00:33:39,123
Scott: Right.

566
00:33:39,628 --> 00:33:41,040
Scott: Same way the NCAA basketball.

567
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:45,262
Rym: Part of the reason you might do this, forget the math of it or like, you know, tournament theory.

568
00:33:45,584 --> 00:33:49,301
Rym: You guys realize tournament theory is a for real, like serious field of stuff.

569
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:49,582
Scott: Of course.

570
00:33:49,602 --> 00:33:49,763
Rym: Yeah.

571
00:33:49,884 --> 00:34:00,540
Rym: But one reason you would do this is basically to reward people who in the qualifications of a tournament, for example, did exceptionally well by giving them easier matches or even buys.

572
00:34:01,182 --> 00:34:05,856
Scott: So if you don't have to play in the first year, you did really well during the regular season of football.

573
00:34:06,821 --> 00:34:12,545
Scott: So now in the playoffs, which are a tournament, you get to skip the first round and you get home field advantage.

574
00:34:13,069 --> 00:34:15,440
Scott: And, you know, this means that you're more likely to go.

575
00:34:15,501 --> 00:34:19,764
Scott: It's going to be easier for you to go farther in the tournament, but the best team is still going to win.

576
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:24,760
Scott: And if you look at, you know, the playoffs, it's still it's analogous to like in Formula One.

577
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,420
Rym: You have the qualifying lab and then, you know, pole position.

578
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,625
Rym: Everything is determined by that.

579
00:34:28,645 --> 00:34:35,159
Rym: If you spend more effort in that, you've kind of spent resources of your car to get ahead.

580
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,184
Rym: So you're rewarded for that.

581
00:34:36,967 --> 00:34:56,438
Rym: It makes sure that players, even in, you know, pre tournament play or pre like final round play, have an incentive to try really hard to make the game entertaining and to do well, where if there wasn't a reward for doing better in the regular season, once you're qualified, there's literally no reason to even show up.

582
00:34:56,621 --> 00:35:01,848
Scott: What it is, is you want to have a single elimination style of tournament because it's pretty much like everyone.

583
00:35:01,868 --> 00:35:03,260
Scott: you play, you beat someone.

584
00:35:03,341 --> 00:35:04,519
Scott: That means you're better than them.

585
00:35:04,842 --> 00:35:06,700
Scott: You play against someone else who beat someone.

586
00:35:06,841 --> 00:35:11,020
Scott: And in the end, the winner is the best in a single elimination tournament, right?

587
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:11,602
Scott: Pretty much.

588
00:35:12,104 --> 00:35:17,340
Scott: But the single elimination tournament has a flaw in that there is a lot of room for flukeiness.

589
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:22,424
Scott: What if I'm the best, but in one fluke match, there was wind because it was golf or something.

590
00:35:22,868 --> 00:35:24,179
Scott: And I lost because of that.

591
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,420
Rym: There's a reason the Stanley Cup is seven games.

592
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,062
Scott: That's right.

593
00:35:27,102 --> 00:35:31,923
Scott: You want to remove flukeiness so you can determine more accurately the true champion.

594
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:44,800
Scott: And that's why prior to the single elimination tournament, you have this multi round thing to remove elements of luck and chance and, you know, to to really know rigorously that a gold medal winner is the winner.

595
00:35:46,002 --> 00:35:52,200
Scott: So that's, you know, that's why you combine things like, you know, you have a qualifying to test rigorously who is the best.

596
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:58,120
Rym: Now, again, we're still assuming that the primary goal of a tournament is to figure out who is, in fact, the best right now.

597
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,664
Rym: Obviously, you can try to game the structure of a tournament, much like if you look at voting.

598
00:36:03,704 --> 00:36:05,120
Scott: Yeah, the tournament is a game.

599
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,160
Scott: The games themselves are a game within the larger game.

600
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,240
Scott: The tournament is the game you want to win.

601
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:14,062
Rym: I'm saying look at like first pass the post versus run off all these different ways of voting.

602
00:36:14,082 --> 00:36:19,180
Rym: You have the situation where you might want to act in a way that is conducive to winning this particular tournament.

603
00:36:19,683 --> 00:36:21,640
Rym: I did this myself in high school.

604
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,567
Rym: I was in Quizball.

605
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,280
Rym: Our school was pretty renowned.

606
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:31,724
Rym: We had good people and we would often lose a match on purpose to get our own utility, which might be.

607
00:36:32,086 --> 00:36:40,700
Rym: we know who we'd be up against if we were seeded at X. So maybe we would lose the game to make sure our seed was different to play someone else in the first round of the next tournament.

608
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,515
Scott: There are also other situations like, you know, who's the best?

609
00:36:43,615 --> 00:36:44,460
Scott: rock, paper, scissors?

610
00:36:45,982 --> 00:36:46,303
Scott: Right.

611
00:36:46,403 --> 00:36:52,578
Scott: Well, you know, if you're rock, you're going to want to play scissors in round one so you can make it to round two.

612
00:36:52,981 --> 00:36:59,000
Scott: Now I'm playing against, you know, I don't know, would I just make it up other guys?

613
00:36:59,503 --> 00:37:00,230
Scott: It's rock.

614
00:37:00,331 --> 00:37:01,319
Scott: I'm playing against peace.

615
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,297
Scott: So rocks plant rocks playing against wood.

616
00:37:03,781 --> 00:37:06,900
Scott: Rock is already won enough matches because he's fucking rock, right?

617
00:37:07,201 --> 00:37:08,620
Scott: He's already going to be in the tournament.

618
00:37:09,181 --> 00:37:12,360
Scott: If he loses to wood, he gets to play scissors in round one.

619
00:37:12,762 --> 00:37:17,444
Scott: If he beats wood, which he might be able to do, he's going to play against paper in round one.

620
00:37:17,504 --> 00:37:17,929
Rym: Forget that.

621
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:18,980
Rym: Look at personal stuff.

622
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:28,420
Rym: You know, in board games, we talk about how one of the worst things that can happen is when someone who cannot win the game has the power to determine the winner of the game.

623
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,640
Rym: It's generally a sign of poor game design.

624
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,606
Rym: Oh, yeah.

625
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:34,240
Rym: And in tournaments, it's the same way.

626
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:40,240
Rym: If you have a you could have a situation where I'm still playing around, I'm not eliminated from the tournament.

627
00:37:40,741 --> 00:37:45,680
Rym: I still have to play around, but I cannot qualify for the next round.

628
00:37:45,942 --> 00:37:46,144
Scott: Right.

629
00:37:46,164 --> 00:37:47,720
Scott: So like we're doing the round robin thing.

630
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:50,940
Scott: I've lost two matches, but I have to play a third match in my group.

631
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,666
Rym: But now I'm playing against.

632
00:37:53,189 --> 00:37:56,000
Scott: it's impossible for me to move on to the real tournament.

633
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:08,066
Scott: But I'm playing against this guy, you know, it's like, well, I can do some dick things to really screw this guy over or I could lose on purpose to him to make sure he gets into the qualifier instead of.

634
00:38:08,628 --> 00:38:11,841
Scott: maybe the other guy is a neighboring country that I'm friendly with.

635
00:38:12,162 --> 00:38:22,043
Scott: And if he wins, my rival is now not going to be in the tournament, you know, where as if I had played to win, maybe I could have beaten this guy because he's the scissors to my rock.

636
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:25,683
Scott: And then my rival would have also entered the tournament, though I would not have.

637
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:26,980
Rym: So what happened in the Olympics?

638
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:32,000
Rym: Basically, there were teams where in the round robin, very, very good teams.

639
00:38:32,321 --> 00:38:40,360
Rym: They were in a situation where both teams had no more reason to play and actually, in fact, had a vested interest in losing.

640
00:38:40,561 --> 00:38:46,338
Rym: Yes, even though you've seen three stooges is where two people are trying to throw a boxing match at the same time.

641
00:38:47,504 --> 00:38:48,860
Rym: Not fun to watch.

642
00:38:49,461 --> 00:38:52,200
Scott: Oh, so this caused big problems.

643
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,700
Scott: Number one, there is a rule in the books that they have, which is sort of a B.S.

644
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,778
Scott: rule, but it is a rule.

645
00:38:57,081 --> 00:38:58,540
Rym: It's the shadows over Camelot rule.

646
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,083
Scott: Exactly.

647
00:38:59,143 --> 00:39:01,620
Scott: That says you have to try to win every match.

648
00:39:02,043 --> 00:39:03,860
Scott: So they broke that rule and were disqualified.

649
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,320
Scott: So I would argue that's all there is to it.

650
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:13,885
Scott: I would argue that that rule, because it very heavily rule says you had to try to win the match.

651
00:39:14,006 --> 00:39:15,280
Scott: It did not say you had to win the tournament.

652
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:20,940
Rym: What I'm saying is that that rule is broken in the sense that it relies upon intense.

653
00:39:21,261 --> 00:39:21,482
Scott: Yep.

654
00:39:21,582 --> 00:39:27,483
Rym: So then the skill becomes, can I throw the match without it appearing that I'm doing so?

655
00:39:27,523 --> 00:39:31,500
Rym: What right does the referee have to say you are trying to throw the match?

656
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,589
Scott: But in this case, just sucking.

657
00:39:33,669 --> 00:39:36,302
Scott: in this case, it is two people trying to throw the boxing match.

658
00:39:36,342 --> 00:39:38,939
Scott: There was no question that they were trying to throw the match at all.

659
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:39,602
Scott: No, no.

660
00:39:39,984 --> 00:39:41,370
Scott: You know, now this situation is.

661
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:46,639
Rym: there have been soccer games that came down to two teams trying to score into their own nets.

662
00:39:46,961 --> 00:39:47,346
Scott: There have.

663
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:47,893
Scott: I've seen them.

664
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:48,319
Scott: Yeah.

665
00:39:48,661 --> 00:39:57,048
Rym: So this happens in a lot of sports, and every time it is because of poor game design, if there is ever a situation where a player

666
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,291
Scott: who cannot

667
00:39:58,351 --> 00:40:02,142
Rym: win the game can decide who does win the game

668
00:40:02,463 --> 00:40:08,600
Scott: or somebody who could win is trying to lose a part of a tournament on purpose to gain an advantage.

669
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:09,501
Scott: Right.

670
00:40:09,521 --> 00:40:12,920
Scott: They are not putting forth the full effort, as you know, you would intend.

671
00:40:14,065 --> 00:40:15,480
Scott: That is because the game is broken.

672
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,200
Scott: The blame lies with the game.

673
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,004
Scott: Not the player.

674
00:40:18,024 --> 00:40:22,024
Rym: The people who wrote the rules for this tournament in the Olympics are fucked up.

675
00:40:22,205 --> 00:40:24,460
Rym: They would they they Hunger Games did.

676
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:24,681
Scott: Right.

677
00:40:24,721 --> 00:40:32,002
Scott: But it caused them a lot of problems because now you have people who bought tickets to watch this and now they're watching two teams trying to lose the second part.

678
00:40:32,765 --> 00:40:39,759
Rym: We care in the Olympics nominally about who is the best at something in the world, but we also care about whether or not it is entertaining to watch.

679
00:40:41,181 --> 00:40:51,131
Rym: And if we just care about who is best, the rules of this game basically said that one of the skills of being best is being able to lose on purpose while appearing that you're not doing so.

680
00:40:51,395 --> 00:40:51,740
Scott: Exactly.

681
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,720
Rym: So thus, it's not fun to watch those matches.

682
00:40:55,523 --> 00:40:58,020
Rym: I think the punishment against these players is ridiculous.

683
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:58,923
Rym: I think whoever.

684
00:40:59,024 --> 00:41:00,331
Scott: Well, I mean, I think it's it's.

685
00:41:00,633 --> 00:41:07,979
Scott: you can't really argue with it too much because they did have the bullshit rule of you must try to win the match, but they didn't even try to look like they were trying to win the match.

686
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:08,240
Rym: True.

687
00:41:08,261 --> 00:41:17,601
Rym: But at the same time, I feel like that rule is that's like if we play a game in Puerto Rico and I'm going to win and you can't win, but there's a way for you to guarantee that.

688
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:23,573
Scott: But there's no rule in Puerto Rico that says you must at all times attempt to get as many victory points as you can.

689
00:41:25,062 --> 00:41:27,857
Scott: And I choose like craftsmen, even though I've got a better example.

690
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,242
Rym: Look at power grid.

691
00:41:30,366 --> 00:41:35,482
Rym: Very often players will fuck up or pull back on purpose, use the rubber band.

692
00:41:35,523 --> 00:41:35,743
Scott: Yes.

693
00:41:35,864 --> 00:41:39,660
Rym: Or look at look at the stadium bicycle racing.

694
00:41:40,421 --> 00:41:40,622
Scott: Yeah.

695
00:41:40,662 --> 00:41:41,124
Scott: Well, they were all.

696
00:41:41,144 --> 00:41:41,647
Scott: they were.

697
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:44,662
Rym: people stop or go slow on purpose to start from behind.

698
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:45,043
Scott: Yeah.

699
00:41:45,525 --> 00:41:50,420
Rym: The fact is, anytime suddenly that something like that happens, it means that whoever designed the game made a mistake.

700
00:41:50,501 --> 00:41:51,780
Rym: The game is poorly designed.

701
00:41:52,201 --> 00:41:53,004
Rym: Don't patch it.

702
00:41:53,225 --> 00:42:00,440
Rym: Any time you have a soft rule, like you can kind of say what kind of cards you got in your hand or the player has to try their best.

703
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,803
Rym: That's bullshit.

704
00:42:02,504 --> 00:42:09,862
Scott: So so, yeah, the tournament was broken, even though there's nothing fucked up.

705
00:42:09,882 --> 00:42:13,462
Scott: So let's talk about, you know, different kinds of tournaments and their pros and cons.

706
00:42:13,482 --> 00:42:16,780
Rym: I am a big fan when I am in tournaments of double elimination.

707
00:42:17,021 --> 00:42:17,283
Rym: Yes.

708
00:42:17,344 --> 00:42:19,280
Rym: Even though it's a giant pain in the ass to organize.

709
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:19,965
Rym: Yeah.

710
00:42:19,985 --> 00:42:20,999
Rym: It's the most fun.

711
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,500
Rym: It reduces flukeiness to a good degree.

712
00:42:24,105 --> 00:42:25,300
Rym: And I just really like brackets.

713
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:25,840
Scott: Yeah.

714
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:33,360
Scott: The more you try to reduce flukeiness, you're going to run into, you know, problems of people trying to lose on purpose, you know, to get seating.

715
00:42:33,521 --> 00:42:37,860
Scott: So, you know, the double elimination allows you to screw up one time.

716
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:50,023
Rym: You can eliminate the problem of people trying to lose on purpose by one, making sure that it is pretty much always to the player's advantage to have a better seed and two, by setting up to where.

717
00:42:50,204 --> 00:42:59,019
Rym: if there could be a situation where a player would be playing against someone who wanted to lose, that that match does not happen and there's a buy in the problem with advantage of better seed.

718
00:42:59,341 --> 00:42:59,622
Scott: Right.

719
00:42:59,783 --> 00:43:03,860
Scott: Is that the the rock, paper, scissors problem, right?

720
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,620
Scott: It's like, well, theoretically, any tournament have that problem.

721
00:43:07,821 --> 00:43:10,400
Scott: Well, for example, Street Fighter might have that problem, right?

722
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:15,902
Scott: Where, OK, if I try hard to get the highest seed possible, they're going to put me against a guy who's worse.

723
00:43:16,284 --> 00:43:22,339
Scott: Oh, but that guy plays this character in this style, which is really bad for me, even though everyone else is pretty good at beating it.

724
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:27,220
Scott: But I'm way better than that guy at the same time when I'm going to get seated against him.

725
00:43:27,601 --> 00:43:33,619
Scott: If I lose, I'll get seated against a guy who's a little better than him, but plays with a style and a character that I'm really good against.

726
00:43:34,021 --> 00:43:45,119
Rym: So I don't know two ways around that, because even while people try to use logic like that, one, a lot of times the skills aren't nearly I guess they're more fungible than you'd expect.

727
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,780
Rym: Players can play different characters.

728
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,500
Rym: It's like the sideboard and magic tournaments.

729
00:43:49,322 --> 00:43:51,820
Rym: Magic tournaments, by the way, have a fucked up magic.

730
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,440
Scott: Tournaments are really fucked up there and they don't even care.

731
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:58,503
Rym: They're just like whatever the incentivization of magic, of like sanctioned magic tournaments.

732
00:43:59,027 --> 00:44:00,960
Rym: A game theorist would shoot himself if he read.

733
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,685
Scott: Let's talk about this.

734
00:44:02,986 --> 00:44:05,800
Scott: The reason magic tournaments are designed the way they are.

735
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:06,221
Scott: Right.

736
00:44:06,241 --> 00:44:10,204
Scott: I don't know too many details, but basically what they read, like four articles on this reason.

737
00:44:10,284 --> 00:44:19,592
Scott: OK, one of the things that they optimize for, which is pretty interesting, is, you know, you got a poker tournaments have sort of a similar thing, kind of which is the player.

738
00:44:19,612 --> 00:44:19,734
Scott: Right.

739
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,469
Scott: A single elimination tournament.

740
00:44:21,509 --> 00:44:22,980
Scott: You enter, you lose immediately.

741
00:44:23,262 --> 00:44:23,685
Scott: You're out.

742
00:44:24,108 --> 00:44:25,660
Scott: It's like, well, that sucks.

743
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:32,485
Scott: They're trying to give the player more enjoyment, even if they lose, so that you can play more games.

744
00:44:32,505 --> 00:44:37,639
Rym: You can have more fun as the people who play magic tend to go to a magic event and only play magic the whole time.

745
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:40,520
Scott: So like I went to a magic tournament once and I did single elimination.

746
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:40,982
Scott: I entered.

747
00:44:41,062 --> 00:44:47,379
Scott: I got my ass kicked and then I sat around and did nothing till another tournament started that I could actually cry in a magic tournament once.

748
00:44:47,801 --> 00:44:48,062
Scott: Right.

749
00:44:48,123 --> 00:44:51,720
Rym: Because I played with a 400 card deck and I beat him anyway.

750
00:44:52,081 --> 00:44:52,362
Scott: Yeah.

751
00:44:52,502 --> 00:45:00,180
Scott: So but it's like if you were to so they make a magic tournament to where you play a bunch of games no matter what.

752
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:00,802
Scott: So you're not.

753
00:45:00,822 --> 00:45:05,640
Scott: you enter and you have a lot of fun playing a lot of magic, even if you keep getting your ass kicked.

754
00:45:05,962 --> 00:45:12,180
Scott: And so they want to optimize for that to make more people have fun at the tournaments, keep coming, keep paying to play.

755
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,226
Scott: It's a pay to entry.

756
00:45:13,447 --> 00:45:15,760
Scott: You want to get your money's worth, play a lot of games.

757
00:45:16,021 --> 00:45:20,280
Scott: But the result is the badminton problem times a million.

758
00:45:20,662 --> 00:45:25,823
Rym: Now, most people are familiar with single elimination because any convention, any nerdy thing you go to.

759
00:45:26,887 --> 00:45:31,600
Rym: Speaking of someone who helps run big conventions, it's a pain in the ass to run a tournament and they take forever.

760
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:37,740
Rym: Single elimination is really the only format that is even reasonably feasible to run unlimited resources.

761
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:47,799
Scott: You know what my favorite kind of tournament is the everyone come up right and gets X number of tries at a thing and then you get something with a score.

762
00:45:48,282 --> 00:45:52,262
Rym: Those are boring because the kinds of tournaments I like are direct competition tournaments.

763
00:45:52,282 --> 00:46:01,499
Scott: I do like direct competition, but, you know, it's like that tournament, though, works the best mechanically, even though it's not entertaining, you know, to really watch or be in it.

764
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:01,840
Scott: Right.

765
00:46:02,122 --> 00:46:06,625
Scott: But like imagine if everyone played Dig Dug, you get three games, three game overs.

766
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,060
Scott: Your highest score counts.

767
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,125
Scott: That removes flukiness.

768
00:46:09,387 --> 00:46:12,522
Scott: And we just post the scores highest score at the end of the day as the winner.

769
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:17,600
Rym: But much more everyone can, you know, it's much more fun is two player Dig Dug players eliminated.

770
00:46:18,121 --> 00:46:20,700
Rym: Oh, yeah, that's much more entertaining to everyone involved, of course.

771
00:46:20,801 --> 00:46:23,660
Scott: But if you want to determine who's the best Dig Dug, that's a great format.

772
00:46:23,802 --> 00:46:24,939
Scott: It doesn't take a lot of time.

773
00:46:25,302 --> 00:46:27,660
Scott: It doesn't have any, you know, bullshit trying to lose.

774
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:29,920
Scott: You just try to get the fucking highest score you can each time.

775
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:38,080
Rym: The thing is, in well-designed tournaments, very rarely is there actually a real incentive to lose it only when they are poorly designed as this come into play.

776
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:44,437
Rym: This badminton tournament could have been fairly easily reworked to where no one would ever have actually wanted to lose a round match.

777
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,880
Scott: But I mean, there's all these factors, right?

778
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:53,480
Scott: Entertainment for spectator, entertainment for player, you know, does it actually determine the true winner?

779
00:46:53,580 --> 00:47:01,982
Scott: There are tournaments you could set up where they're so flawed that you might win the tournament, but might not actually be the best player there because the tournament was broken.

780
00:47:02,866 --> 00:47:05,520
Scott: Making sure no one tries to lose all these different things.

781
00:47:05,843 --> 00:47:07,180
Scott: You can't have all of them.

782
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:10,000
Scott: You need to choose some of them above others, right?

783
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:15,760
Scott: There is no tournament structure I've ever seen that allows for all of those things to be maximized to perfection.

784
00:47:16,142 --> 00:47:16,946
Scott: It does not exist.

785
00:47:16,986 --> 00:47:19,940
Scott: There's probably some mathematical law that it can't exist.

786
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:20,802
Rym: I don't know.

787
00:47:21,064 --> 00:47:23,560
Rym: I don't know if it was this year or not, but apparently it won Olympics.

788
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:33,800
Rym: The Japanese women's soccer team played a game to a draw on purpose because it meant that in the tournament season, they wouldn't have to travel far to the next round.

789
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,080
Scott: Oh, see, more factors coming into play.

790
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:36,864
Rym: Exactly.

791
00:47:38,238 --> 00:47:38,420
Scott: Anyway.

792
00:47:39,561 --> 00:47:44,347
Rym: Oh, I found a whole list of Olympic things that are almost identical to what the badminton players did.

793
00:47:44,368 --> 00:47:44,997
Rym: that was totally OK.

794
00:47:46,101 --> 00:47:52,799
Rym: Like in cycling with like getting into a peloton and slowing it down on purpose to let your teammate get ahead, stuff like that.

795
00:47:54,340 --> 00:48:05,160
Rym: So really what it comes down to is if you are making a tournament from a game theorist's perspective to determine the best player, there's math.

796
00:48:05,381 --> 00:48:07,160
Rym: Use the math and come up with the best tournament.

797
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:16,080
Rym: If you're making a tournament in the real world, use the tournament that causes the most entertainment to happen for all involved.

798
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,039
Scott: I thought of another example, right?

799
00:48:19,201 --> 00:48:22,763
Scott: Let's say it's a. you're having a tournament of a sport where you could actually become exhausted.

800
00:48:23,285 --> 00:48:31,078
Scott: You might want to get a seed to where you're going to play your next game later in the day to have more resting time, whereas you might see it against something you might if you win.

801
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:32,520
Rym: You know how Quiz Bowl got around?

802
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:39,879
Scott: If you win, you might see it against someone who's really bad and you're guaranteed to beat them, maybe, but you're going to have to play them pretty much right now.

803
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:45,441
Rym: Quiz Bowl got around that by not telling you when the matches would be or where they would be.

804
00:48:45,501 --> 00:48:53,039
Scott: concealing, concealing information from the players is very good, because as soon as it's uncertain, your decision is arbitrary.

805
00:48:54,320 --> 00:49:00,784
Rym: But I don't feel we could do a whole separate show, I think, on specifically tournaments and conventions.

806
00:49:01,006 --> 00:49:02,816
Scott: Well, I mean, as I realize we can do tournaments and conventions.

807
00:49:03,823 --> 00:49:05,580
Rym: So I played in my entire life.

808
00:49:05,682 --> 00:49:06,780
Rym: I played in a magic tournament.

809
00:49:07,223 --> 00:49:09,080
Rym: I played in a Dungeons and Dragons tournament.

810
00:49:09,761 --> 00:49:14,260
Rym: Yeah, Michicon, like one of those hardcore like points from a settlement tournament.

811
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:17,220
Rym: I played in the in a like sanctioned Settlers tournament.

812
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:21,033
Rym: And until recently, I hadn't really played in any other tournaments.

813
00:49:21,073 --> 00:49:29,019
Rym: because when I go to a con, a tournament like I'll look at a tournament like Puerto Rico tournament, I'll be like, I guarantee I could win that show.

814
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,070
Scott: I could come close.

815
00:49:30,192 --> 00:49:30,699
Scott: Guaranteed.

816
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:31,184
Scott: I don't know.

817
00:49:31,205 --> 00:49:32,159
Scott: You know, defense is playing.

818
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:35,100
Rym: Yeah, I remember there's the guy's got Carcassonne tournament.

819
00:49:35,341 --> 00:49:36,126
Scott: Yeah, you can win that.

820
00:49:36,166 --> 00:49:42,565
Scott: But I mean, remember, there's that guy at the PAX tournaments who has like the frickin armor of medals because he just frickin plays all of them and wins everything to me.

821
00:49:42,706 --> 00:49:44,500
Rym: But then I look and I'm like, all right.

822
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,899
Rym: Dominion Tournament, four and a half hours.

823
00:49:47,223 --> 00:49:48,820
Rym: And then I look in that four and a half hours.

824
00:49:49,000 --> 00:50:00,240
Rym: I can go get a beer and a steak, see a panel, play like two board games or different board games, not the same one times and be in a tournament that takes forever.

825
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:10,542
Scott: And the thing is, you're not going to necessarily when you join a tournament, you're not necessarily going to be playing at the entire time, but you sort of have to hang around for when your next matches or maybe they'll tell you the time and you to come back.

826
00:50:10,783 --> 00:50:19,503
Scott: And basically you always fall behind that you're leaving and coming back constantly to play a game, play a game, leave, you know, you're playing the same game over and over.

827
00:50:19,965 --> 00:50:29,542
Scott: And it's kind of cool to try to win the tournament, especially if there's good prizes for the variety of the experience, not for the one tournament that takes half my day.

828
00:50:29,603 --> 00:50:33,860
Scott: Yeah, it's much better for these sorts of tournaments, you know, to be standalone.

829
00:50:34,202 --> 00:50:37,622
Scott: If there's a tournament in packs, it's like, well, I'm not going to do that when I get packs.

830
00:50:37,944 --> 00:50:42,023
Scott: But if there's just a Dominion tournament in New York City, oh, my God, that's all it is.

831
00:50:42,425 --> 00:50:44,680
Scott: It's like, of course, I'm going to show up.

832
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,800
Scott: It's not like it's competing with anything, especially if it's in the winter or something.

833
00:50:48,642 --> 00:50:58,160
Rym: So crewmate row let us in on the secret, because, you know, packs one of the things they do, if you win a tournament, you get a medal, you get this huge, solid medal.

834
00:50:58,340 --> 00:50:58,843
Scott: Yeah, I don't want it.

835
00:50:58,883 --> 00:51:01,560
Scott: It's not actually that huge, but I have ones and you don't.

836
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,860
Scott: So, yeah, it's fucking gigantic.

837
00:51:04,581 --> 00:51:11,083
Rym: So what she told us was to play pick a tournament that won't take long on like Sunday morning.

838
00:51:11,184 --> 00:51:11,345
Scott: Yeah.

839
00:51:11,365 --> 00:51:16,619
Scott: When no one will show up, especially, you know, one of those tournaments for a less popular game where not too many people are going to enter.

840
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:19,119
Scott: So they'll only be like maybe one or two rounds.

841
00:51:19,301 --> 00:51:20,920
Rym: So Scott and I show up for this zero tournament.

842
00:51:21,001 --> 00:51:22,859
Rym: We're like, all right, that's a short game, too.

843
00:51:23,001 --> 00:51:24,220
Scott: It's not a game that takes a long time.

844
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,439
Rym: We're like, look, no one will show up.

845
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,868
Rym: It's going to be a 50/50 chance.

846
00:51:26,888 --> 00:51:29,583
Rym: one of us is getting that medal and then we can say we want a medal.

847
00:51:30,025 --> 00:51:35,500
Rym: Then we show up and there were a bunch of people that were actually seven people total, which is the maximum for one game of zero.

848
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:40,762
Scott: So it actually we only had to play in the one zero and the company that publishes it was there.

849
00:51:41,104 --> 00:51:44,547
Rym: And they were like, look, we're using some rules that make the game not 100 percent random.

850
00:51:44,567 --> 00:51:45,519
Rym: They were really good rules.

851
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:45,881
Scott: Yeah.

852
00:51:45,922 --> 00:51:47,931
Scott: And we played a few games and it's like you got.

853
00:51:48,172 --> 00:51:56,940
Scott: it was sort of like an F1 ish system where, you know, the way F1 works is you have a grand prix and you win the grand prix, which you always want to do, because why wouldn't you want to win the grand prix?

854
00:51:57,041 --> 00:51:57,866
Scott: No one tries to lose.

855
00:51:58,369 --> 00:52:00,120
Scott: If you come in first place, you get 10 points.

856
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:02,600
Scott: If you come in second place, you get seven points.

857
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:09,440
Scott: Whatever the points are going down to like eventually, I think, like eighth place gets one point and less than eighth place is zero points.

858
00:52:09,601 --> 00:52:13,060
Scott: And then you add up the points you get from all the different races.

859
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:15,880
Scott: Never has the most points at the end of all the races wins.

860
00:52:16,223 --> 00:52:17,395
Scott: So it was a similar system like that.

861
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:19,960
Scott: You know, a first place gets you this many points.

862
00:52:20,501 --> 00:52:22,620
Scott: So and that makes you always want to win everything.

863
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:22,863
Rym: Yep.

864
00:52:22,944 --> 00:52:23,980
Rym: So it went really well.

865
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:32,998
Rym: Now, Scott and I, you know, often talk about how bad ass we are at board games and we're very kind of full of ourselves and people who go to Nerd NYC often look at us like, uh, but then we win.

866
00:52:33,281 --> 00:52:33,484
Rym: Yeah.

867
00:52:33,504 --> 00:52:34,518
Rym: So they can't really say much.

868
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:35,939
Rym: So we show up to this thing.

869
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:38,160
Rym: Scott wins the first round, like ridiculously.

870
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:40,720
Rym: I win the next round ridiculously.

871
00:52:41,441 --> 00:52:45,080
Rym: We pretty much tie in the third round and it was a perfect draw between me and Scott.

872
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:45,482
Scott: Yep.

873
00:52:45,705 --> 00:52:48,399
Scott: So in sudden death, Me and Rym had a tiebreaker and I won.

874
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:50,934
Rym: The tiebreaker came down to one card.

875
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:52,364
Scott: Yep.

876
00:52:52,996 --> 00:52:53,159
Scott: I won.

877
00:52:53,462 --> 00:52:53,744
Rym: Yep.

878
00:52:53,764 --> 00:52:55,980
Rym: Scott won one by the flaw.

879
00:52:56,100 --> 00:53:02,260
Scott: And this this see this kind of tournament, the F1 style is great because number one, great entertainment for the participant.

880
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:05,800
Scott: You get to play a lot because you can just keep playing to add up more points.

881
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:12,159
Scott: You know, suddenly halfway through the the games, the other the guy in first could start losing and you could start winning and you can come back.

882
00:53:13,741 --> 00:53:18,502
Scott: It's also great for the spectator because every match is most of them are really interesting.

883
00:53:19,325 --> 00:53:25,680
Scott: The problem it has is that problem of losing guy can screw things up for winning guy.

884
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:34,543
Scott: You could be like, you know, for example, maybe the last ground free of the season doesn't matter because the guy already has so many points, even if he disqualifies himself.

885
00:53:34,624 --> 00:53:36,055
Scott: And there's a great place.

886
00:53:36,095 --> 00:53:36,760
Scott: guy wins.

887
00:53:37,022 --> 00:53:38,059
Scott: He still wins the holes.

888
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,160
Rym: There is a great video from some race.

889
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,490
Rym: It was on College Humor a while ago.

890
00:53:41,511 --> 00:53:42,660
Rym: It was something like it wasn't ground free.

891
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,259
Rym: It was like some minor circuit racing.

892
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:48,399
Rym: Like and basically a guy got passed and he wasn't going to win.

893
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:52,540
Rym: So he cut across the grass and rammed his rival.

894
00:53:52,921 --> 00:53:53,222
Scott: Yup.

895
00:53:53,964 --> 00:54:00,700
Scott: You know, let's say Rym is in first place and he's going to win the championship as well as the Grand Prix.

896
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:06,320
Scott: But if he comes in second place or less, he will not win the championship.

897
00:54:06,861 --> 00:54:09,579
Scott: So, you know, he's coming up to to pass me.

898
00:54:09,882 --> 00:54:10,205
Scott: Right.

899
00:54:10,529 --> 00:54:11,660
Scott: So I'm lapped.

900
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:12,347
Scott: I'm losing.

901
00:54:12,448 --> 00:54:13,580
Scott: I'm so many points away.

902
00:54:13,741 --> 00:54:18,704
Scott: Even if I won the race and everyone else crashed, I would not win the championship going backwards.

903
00:54:18,744 --> 00:54:27,644
Scott: So, yeah, I'll just freaking get in front of Rym and not let him pass me until the second place guy can catch up to him or crash into Rym or do whatever I can to make Rym not first place.

904
00:54:27,684 --> 00:54:41,268
Scott: And then I someone who is lost can have an influence, has no chance of winning, can have a huge influence on who wins the championship, you know, because I can throw a monkey wrench in there because I'm still participating, even though my chances of winning the whole thing, well-designed

905
00:54:41,309 --> 00:54:44,167
Rym: games and well-designed tournaments minimize the possibility.

906
00:54:44,188 --> 00:54:44,976
Scott: You know what they do in F1.

907
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:52,360
Scott: Actually, F1 has a very clever in-game solution, the blue flag, which is you're getting lapped like the first place guy comes around you.

908
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:53,527
Scott: They wave the blue flag at you.

909
00:54:53,588 --> 00:54:55,280
Scott: You have to let him go or else you're fucked.

910
00:54:56,103 --> 00:54:57,959
Scott: So that's not the worst solution in the world.

911
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:58,281
Rym: Yeah.

912
00:54:58,522 --> 00:55:05,100
Rym: Like in Suro, it could have been a problem because people who aren't winning around could trivially just attack and kill someone who's doing well.

913
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:05,582
Scott: That's true.

914
00:55:06,084 --> 00:55:16,377
Rym: And I think the only reason that didn't happen was that basically Scott and I were trash talking each other the entire time to such an epic degree that everyone else was kind of just sitting back watching us.

915
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:16,821
Rym: Yeah.

916
00:55:17,223 --> 00:55:18,007
Scott: You know, that's another thing.

917
00:55:18,047 --> 00:55:26,447
Scott: is you have to consider the game itself, right, is not, you know, is for different, even though you have the same exact tournament structure, which will have the same flaws.

918
00:55:26,487 --> 00:55:31,640
Scott: no matter what the game is, certain games like it might be impossible to try to lose on purpose.

919
00:55:32,141 --> 00:55:39,400
Scott: You know, it's like there's no way in this game for me to lose on purpose or there is no way in this game for me to attack another player.

920
00:55:39,441 --> 00:55:40,699
Scott: I can't bring anyone down.

921
00:55:41,142 --> 00:55:44,040
Scott: So even though if I could do that, it would mess the tournament up.

922
00:55:44,404 --> 00:55:45,719
Scott: There's no way in game to do it.

923
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:46,663
Scott: So it doesn't matter.

924
00:55:47,125 --> 00:55:57,439
Scott: And you want to match up the tournament to the kind of game it is to take advantages of those characteristics, you know, to match them up with the flaws of the tournament so you can get a better result.

925
00:55:59,041 --> 00:55:59,243
Scott: All right.

926
00:55:59,304 --> 00:56:00,780
Scott: Anything else to say about the tournament?

927
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:01,262
Rym: Not really.

928
00:56:01,987 --> 00:56:03,660
Rym: Yeah, I should get the video.

929
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,499
Rym: I have all the video from that outlaw tournament, which, as I recall, I won.

930
00:56:10,365 --> 00:56:12,160
Scott: OK, but yeah, tournaments are awesome.

931
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:14,080
Scott: They're a game in and of themselves.

932
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:15,182
Rym: Sheriff in town.

933
00:56:15,203 --> 00:56:22,259
Scott: Yeah, I suggest you, you know, try to experiment with different kinds of tournaments, you know, or just study tournament theory and read a book.

934
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:23,466
Scott: And yeah, there are.

935
00:56:23,486 --> 00:56:25,739
Scott: But I mean, there are lots of weird ones out there.

936
00:56:25,941 --> 00:56:39,880
Scott: It's like find a short game to play with your friends, like spot it or even rock, paper, scissors or tic tac toe or something that tic tac toe and, you know, play a tournament with your friends and, you know, make the game the tournament and not the game itself.

937
00:56:40,162 --> 00:56:42,139
Scott: And you could actually have quite a bit of fun.

938
00:56:42,662 --> 00:56:48,320
Scott: And when you win the whole thing, you feel way more like a champion than if you just win one game or like, for example, but you know what?

939
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:52,843
Rym: My favorite actual form of tournament is, even though we don't really do anything with it, challenges.

940
00:56:52,863 --> 00:56:55,940
Rym: I challenge you for the title.

941
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:58,320
Rym: I challenge you for the rank per wrestling time.

942
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,740
Rym: Yeah, we should do that with board games.

943
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,540
Scott: Someone holds on to the championship.

944
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,584
Scott: They're the champion.

945
00:57:03,725 --> 00:57:09,880
Scott: Why don't we determine some by the first game and then you have to beat the champion to take the belt away from the champion.

946
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,240
Rym: I feel like we should do that in our own group just for like Tigger's and Euphrates.

947
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:19,450
Scott: The best thing about that method is that you don't need any seating because the basically just have two people playing.

948
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:20,460
Scott: whoever wins is the champion.

949
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:22,840
Scott: And then if you could beat the champion, now you're the new champion.

950
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:32,880
Rym: The problem is, is that the person in the order of multiple challenges or that too often do I just challenge Scott every day until he gets pissed off and rises just like that.

951
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:39,880
Scott: The chair, whoever is the current champion, ends up getting worn out and might lose to someone who challenges later.

952
00:57:39,961 --> 00:57:41,200
Scott: Like I just got the championship.

953
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:41,842
Scott: You challenge.

954
00:57:41,922 --> 00:57:48,640
Rym: That's why you make a laddered structure of challenges where you can't challenge Mike Tyson in round one of punch out.

955
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:49,900
Rym: You get to beat all these other MOOCs first.

956
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:50,322
Scott: That's right.

957
00:57:50,342 --> 00:57:53,440
Scott: Like in boxing, it'll be like, OK, you want to challenge the champ, right?

958
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,980
Scott: Well, you actually have to win this other tournament.

959
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:03,420
Scott: And by winning that other tournament against a bunch of MOOCs, you earn the prize in that tournament is the right to challenge the champ.

960
00:58:03,941 --> 00:58:12,540
Scott: So it's like whoever wins this whole thing, the best of these guys with a regular single elimination tournament, then gets to play the champ to be the champ.

961
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:15,480
Scott: That is good to be the champ because the champ doesn't have to play in the tournament.

962
00:58:15,723 --> 00:58:16,920
Scott: So he's super not tired.

963
00:58:17,021 --> 00:58:20,800
Scott: And now the reverse problem of dude just fought like six fights in a tournament.

964
00:58:21,224 --> 00:58:22,440
Scott: Now he's going to fight the champ.

965
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:24,839
Scott: It's like, yeah, champs got a big advantage.

966
00:58:25,061 --> 00:58:26,660
Rym: It's a nice that I'm in the sheriff.

967
00:58:28,602 --> 00:58:29,388
Scott: Sheriff of what?

968
00:58:29,428 --> 00:58:30,455
Scott: Sheriff of Foxton?

969
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:34,909
Rym: A sheriff.

970
00:58:35,574 --> 00:58:36,420
Rym: Sheriff of nothing.

971
00:58:42,183 --> 00:58:44,300
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

972
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:49,623
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

973
00:58:49,824 --> 00:58:54,819
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

974
00:58:55,121 --> 00:59:02,479
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows, SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.
