1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,062
Rym: It's Monday September 16th 2019.

2
00:00:12,062 --> 00:00:12,543
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,643 --> 00:00:14,890
Scott: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,457 --> 00:00:16,370
Rym: smart watches.

5
00:00:18,942 --> 00:00:19,979
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:23,067 --> 00:00:26,556
Rym: So I don't know who deleted the smartwatch episode.

7
00:00:26,656 --> 00:00:28,260
Scott: Rym deleted the smartwatch episode.

8
00:00:28,381 --> 00:00:32,580
Rym: I was 100% sure we had done a show on smartwatches me, too.

9
00:00:32,981 --> 00:00:36,191
Scott: Yeah, I'm also still 100% sure that you deleted it.

10
00:00:36,351 --> 00:00:51,560
Rym: best I can find is we've done shows on like Google Glass Specifically it doesn't count and we've sort of talked about wearable tech But we've never talked about like smartwatches Which is kind of good because only recently as five smartwatches sort of really matured into an offering anyway.

11
00:00:51,681 --> 00:00:56,120
Scott: So it's been a long time since we did a GeekNights episode because of too much stuff going on.

12
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:02,411
Scott: there was mostly Pax West Pax West and then My office moved to a new office and

13
00:01:02,451 --> 00:01:04,078
Rym: then yeah, you're also in apartments

14
00:01:04,782 --> 00:01:07,857
Scott: And then I'm also moving apartments and Rym went to Europe,

15
00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:14,678
Rym: yep I was in London for three days and then Frankfurt for two days, and I have a fucking story about

16
00:01:14,698 --> 00:01:15,420
Scott: how I got home.

17
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:18,110
Scott: The point is I'm still I'm still moving.

18
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,258
Scott: I'll be done moving like in a week or two.

19
00:01:20,338 --> 00:01:26,860
Scott: But anyway We've built up a shit ton of opening bits and things of the day and all that but we all know what's gonna happen.

20
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,100
Scott: We're gonna pick only one of the opening bits from that like several week-long period.

21
00:01:32,662 --> 00:01:37,260
Scott: Use it today and then all those other opening bits we're gonna completely forget about.

22
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:43,260
Scott: Wednesday when we do another show we're gonna talk about like some bike or some train thing that happened on.

23
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,488
Rym: So I was biking to work today.

24
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:54,251
Scott: I saw someone riding a trike and I was like So anyway, so, you know so we each between all those things.

25
00:01:54,692 --> 00:02:04,995
Scott: right I have to talk about the thing that happened yesterday Which is that I went to see Live in person babymetal for the second time.

26
00:02:05,015 --> 00:02:09,252
Scott: Oh, yeah Right, so, you know, I was.

27
00:02:09,834 --> 00:02:11,100
Scott: I wanted to tell people to go.

28
00:02:11,361 --> 00:02:15,580
Scott: Well, I think the person who wanted to go the most is Chase Gordon who is on the other side of the world.

29
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,746
Scott: He's in Singapore.

30
00:02:16,786 --> 00:02:18,936
Scott: He could have seen them in Singapore, but I guess he didn't.

31
00:02:18,997 --> 00:02:23,733
Scott: I don't know Hermit, I know he's a big fan and they're not good.

32
00:02:23,773 --> 00:02:25,821
Scott: They last came in 2016.

33
00:02:25,821 --> 00:02:33,169
Scott: So yeah, you know, I guess soon they're gonna come again in 2022. anyway You know the band had changed a bit.

34
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,960
Scott: right, you know, there's been a lot of things going on with them.

35
00:02:36,321 --> 00:02:41,903
Scott: There was an opening band, which there wasn't last time it was a terminal 5 which is a shitty venue Right.

36
00:02:42,144 --> 00:02:49,352
Scott: So I was sort of like, you know, the opening band was his band called avatar Which was better in person than went on when I checked them out on Spotify.

37
00:02:49,593 --> 00:02:50,596
Scott: They weren't amazing.

38
00:02:51,017 --> 00:02:55,800
Scott: the lead singer You could you could be that guy if you put on that costume and makeup.

39
00:02:56,763 --> 00:02:58,711
Scott: You could be a lot of metal guys, I mean long hair.

40
00:02:58,751 --> 00:03:01,180
Scott: metal guy is something that Rym can easily transform into.

41
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:06,537
Rym: Yeah, the only problem is I can't play any guitar nor can I sing even like well this person.

42
00:03:06,557 --> 00:03:08,483
Scott: well this person sang But I sang.

43
00:03:08,623 --> 00:03:11,051
Scott: the highlight was if you need a metal clean.

44
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,857
Scott: He played trombone.

45
00:03:12,877 --> 00:03:15,609
Rym: Whoa Moderately, wait, what is the sky?

46
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:16,795
Scott: No, no, no, it was just.

47
00:03:16,855 --> 00:03:17,920
Scott: it was just like he got metal.

48
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,361
Scott: He was mostly singing 90%.

49
00:03:20,361 --> 00:03:22,246
Scott: It was one point.

50
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:26,959
Scott: where he comes he goes back it comes out with a trombone and he plays what I must.

51
00:03:27,179 --> 00:03:33,343
Scott: I guess I Can refer to only as a little ditty on it because he wasn't like an amazing trombonist He just played metal.

52
00:03:33,363 --> 00:03:35,851
Rym: band needs someone to play a metal trumpet.

53
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:36,513
Rym: I could do that.

54
00:03:36,574 --> 00:03:37,376
Rym: I think that's.

55
00:03:37,436 --> 00:03:38,500
Scott: I'm sure that band exists.

56
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:46,013
Scott: But anyway, so they open and people are just sort of you know Lightly to normally moshing like you do and I'm like man.

57
00:03:46,254 --> 00:03:51,964
Scott: when I saw baby metal in 2016 People lost their fucking goddamn minds Right.

58
00:03:52,184 --> 00:03:53,087
Rym: So you're worried now.

59
00:03:53,147 --> 00:03:57,340
Scott: So now I'm like, I know I paid here not to see the same band again.

60
00:03:57,401 --> 00:04:01,528
Scott: It's only gonna play like, you know It's a really fucking short show and you see them.

61
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:04,157
Scott: there is you get like an hour and that's it for 60 bucks.

62
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,190
Rym: It's like, you know, it's not like going to see meatloaf.

63
00:04:08,431 --> 00:04:09,575
Scott: No you you there.

64
00:04:09,635 --> 00:04:10,900
Scott: they don't stop and talk.

65
00:04:11,181 --> 00:04:12,566
Scott: They have this defined set.

66
00:04:12,826 --> 00:04:16,218
Scott: they play it non-stop and then it's like boom done over.

67
00:04:16,278 --> 00:04:17,519
Scott: go home Honestly.

68
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:23,000
Rym: Maybe it's just because I'm in my 30s, but I prefer that kind of concert.

69
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:28,540
Rym: I don't want meatloaf to come out on stage for an hour to talk about his crap and then do for me.

70
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,589
Scott: No, a little bit would be okay time.

71
00:04:30,609 --> 00:04:32,558
Scott: You don't even get one encore, right?

72
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:37,980
Scott: Yeah Yeah, exactly the same thing as every other goddamn city, but I'd be fine if on course disappeared.

73
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:50,020
Scott: The point is I'm there because for some reason when people go to see this band Even compared to say like if you go to see fucking bit Metallica, yeah, people do not lose their shit the same way.

74
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,919
Scott: Yeah, they seem to lose their shit.

75
00:04:52,744 --> 00:04:54,492
Scott: Stupid baby metal concert, right?

76
00:04:54,774 --> 00:04:55,980
Scott: So I'm like, huh?

77
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,900
Scott: Are people gonna lose their goddamn minds like they did in 2016?

78
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,926
Scott: I don't know what's gonna happen.

79
00:05:01,947 --> 00:05:03,456
Scott: and then three seconds after they come out.

80
00:05:03,476 --> 00:05:08,075
Scott: It's like oh shit Right, I'm old good time.

81
00:05:08,096 --> 00:05:13,740
Rym: Oh God the I'm old feeling comes strong when I go to a good concert.

82
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,160
Rym: So for my opening vid because there's so much happened like I got a lot of stories.

83
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:23,917
Rym: Do you want to hear about me meeting the Bundesliga?

84
00:05:23,937 --> 00:05:24,239
Rym: say how?

85
00:05:25,942 --> 00:05:28,440
Rym: My foot getting infected to the point that I had to go to the dock.

86
00:05:28,581 --> 00:05:31,478
Scott: I know that your foot get infected when you're poking at it at PAX.

87
00:05:31,518 --> 00:05:33,212
Scott: and yeah I was like what the fuck's wrong with you.

88
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:33,999
Scott: Stop poking at that.

89
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,717
Rym: Yeah, because it was basically it was getting stupid poking at your foot.

90
00:05:37,897 --> 00:05:38,480
Rym: No, it was all right.

91
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,646
Rym: I went got antibiotics for it.

92
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:40,028
Rym: cuz it was.

93
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,376
Scott: maybe you shouldn't have poked at.

94
00:05:41,396 --> 00:05:42,180
Scott: he wouldn't had to do that.

95
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:42,762
Rym: No, I would.

96
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:43,063
Rym: I was.

97
00:05:43,164 --> 00:05:43,445
Rym: it was.

98
00:05:44,168 --> 00:05:46,738
Rym: that kind of infection happens no matter what you do.

99
00:05:46,758 --> 00:05:50,192
Scott: Uh-huh How come it hasn't happened to me cuz you haven't had a wound.

100
00:05:50,734 --> 00:05:52,020
Scott: Yeah, don't wound.

101
00:05:52,281 --> 00:05:53,165
Scott: I got a wound.

102
00:05:53,346 --> 00:05:57,260
Rym: don't do that and I got a wound that because antibiotics exist I was fine.

103
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:07,573
Rym: But in an older era that was probably like a 40% chance of death for in the wound to begin with and it wouldn't Actually, maybe not Neosporin not great on wounds, especially foot wounds.

104
00:06:08,315 --> 00:06:08,936
Scott: Yes points good.

105
00:06:09,217 --> 00:06:10,280
Scott: Nah depends.

106
00:06:10,721 --> 00:06:16,800
Rym: Anyway, anyway, so my brief story is I got home from Frankfurt three hours early.

107
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:23,360
Rym: Okay, because I flew like to London and then to Frankfurt so it was very easy to book that as a right.

108
00:06:23,441 --> 00:06:24,519
Scott: That's the place of an airport.

109
00:06:25,121 --> 00:06:30,977
Rym: Yes, Frankfurt is notable in that it has as a city an international airport in international airport.

110
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:32,040
Scott: It is Rochester, New York.

111
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,210
Rym: Yes, Frankfurt is much bigger than Rochester, New York.

112
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:43,200
Scott: I'm sure it is a giant Airport, but I'm aware Frankfurt has this reputation for being kind of because not a lot of other places in Germany have airports.

113
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,564
Rym: Yeah, actually they all do it.

114
00:06:45,266 --> 00:06:46,189
Rym: They all have airports.

115
00:06:46,269 --> 00:06:49,740
Scott: It's just people kind of the kind that you're gonna fly to from America.

116
00:06:50,482 --> 00:06:51,947
Rym: Ah, I've flown direct to Hamburg.

117
00:06:52,248 --> 00:06:53,311
Rym: I've flown direct to Munich.

118
00:06:53,712 --> 00:06:54,876
Rym: I've flown direct to Berlin.

119
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:56,200
Rym: I've flown direct to Dusseldorf.

120
00:06:57,481 --> 00:06:59,293
Rym: Yeah, you forget about it.

121
00:06:59,313 --> 00:07:00,280
Rym: forget about Dusseldorf.

122
00:07:01,907 --> 00:07:02,760
Rym: Have you been to Dusseldorf?

123
00:07:03,463 --> 00:07:04,293
Scott: No, I haven't been to Europe.

124
00:07:06,701 --> 00:07:12,300
Rym: I've spent actually a weird like a lot of time in Germany over the years, but I like Germany.

125
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:15,809
Scott: I've been in Europe in the sky But I'm not on the ground.

126
00:07:15,929 --> 00:07:19,787
Rym: every time I ever went to Frankfurt I always came back with two impressions.

127
00:07:20,109 --> 00:07:29,480
Rym: one the city's kind of low-key and feels boring Like just very very pleasant and boring and to Frankfurt's Airport sucks balls.

128
00:07:30,382 --> 00:07:31,887
Rym: Like I'm always delayed.

129
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:33,491
Rym: security is always a nightmare.

130
00:07:33,571 --> 00:07:36,058
Scott: customs takes forever like Europe had better security.

131
00:07:36,118 --> 00:07:36,680
Scott: That wasn't stupid.

132
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:46,596
Rym: They do except Frankfurt Especially if you're flying to the two places that are bad about security the United States or London.

133
00:07:46,857 --> 00:07:50,748
Rym: and I was flying to The United States via London.

134
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:51,049
Scott: how?

135
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:53,737
Scott: what if you're flying someplace like I don't know China.

136
00:07:53,978 --> 00:07:54,559
Rym: Oh, then you're fine.

137
00:07:55,141 --> 00:08:00,860
Rym: You really only have a problem if you're flying from anywhere to either the UK or the u.s.

138
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:04,311
Rym: Like when I'm in India, you have to go through security three times.

139
00:08:04,371 --> 00:08:07,200
Scott: all these like the even more evil places on earth.

140
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,065
Scott: They're easy to go to.

141
00:08:08,205 --> 00:08:10,900
Scott: Oh, yeah, you want to fly to like I don't know Eritrea.

142
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,088
Rym: They're like, all right, dude, like fine-tuned from Singapore.

143
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:15,999
Scott: It's probably no flights there ain't even security into your game.

144
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,599
Scott: I don't think anyone has flights to Eritrea.

145
00:08:17,848 --> 00:08:22,655
Rym: Yeah But like in Mumbai you go there's security to get into the airport.

146
00:08:23,357 --> 00:08:25,965
Rym: then in the airport There's security to get into the terminal.

147
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:27,991
Rym: then if you're flying to the u.s.

148
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:31,180
Rym: There's another security run by the TSA.

149
00:08:31,903 --> 00:08:33,249
Rym: Mmm, it's awful.

150
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:33,671
Rym: Mm-hmm.

151
00:08:33,932 --> 00:08:35,880
Rym: But anyway, so Frankfurt, I'll skip all there.

152
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,854
Rym: There's my story, but I got to the airport like three hours before my flight.

153
00:08:39,874 --> 00:08:41,078
Scott: because why so early miss?

154
00:08:41,097 --> 00:08:50,445
Rym: because I extortionist because Extortion victim there ain't no TSA pre check or anything in Frankfurt Extortion victim There ain't none of that.

155
00:08:50,506 --> 00:08:54,640
Rym: They're just the same line for everybody and there's always crazy delays.

156
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,031
Rym: I did not want to have to worry about that.

157
00:08:56,091 --> 00:08:57,160
Rym: Like that's just that Airport.

00:08:57,582 --> 00:09:01,840

159
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:09,180

185
00:10:37,073 --> 00:10:39,467
Rym: He still has to transfer to London Like we were gonna do I could.

186
00:10:39,507 --> 00:10:40,191
Scott: they have two people.

187
00:10:40,211 --> 00:10:41,660
Scott: they couldn't do the same thing for two people.

188
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,865
Rym: No, cuz this is ad-hocs.

189
00:10:42,905 --> 00:10:43,587
Rym: They turned to me.

190
00:10:43,728 --> 00:10:44,652
Scott: They found one seat.

191
00:10:44,872 --> 00:10:46,157
Rym: Yep, and he's my boss.

192
00:10:46,198 --> 00:10:46,820
Rym: He gets precedence.

193
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:53,139
Rym: They deal with him first then they turn to me and the dude literally looks up and says you are spry.

194
00:10:53,159 --> 00:11:01,066
Rym: No And I'm like, I guess and he's like listen, there's a direct flight So I won't even have to go to London.

195
00:11:01,147 --> 00:11:02,291
Rym: direct flight to JFK.

196
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:04,520
Rym: get me home like three hours earlier.

197
00:11:04,861 --> 00:11:07,872
Scott: You go in like a cargo plane a direct flight.

198
00:11:07,932 --> 00:11:10,140
Rym: look Fonza like fancy fancy.

199
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:11,967
Rym: Okay, class upgrade.

200
00:11:12,288 --> 00:11:19,112
Rym: All right, but it takes off in an hour From a different terminal and you're not even checked into this flight.

201
00:11:19,674 --> 00:11:23,508
Rym: So he basically said run To this other terminal.

202
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:24,030
Rym: Mm-hmm.

203
00:11:24,231 --> 00:11:26,260
Rym: I couldn't even wait for the train to take me into that terminal.

204
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,022
Rym: I didn't know time.

205
00:11:27,263 --> 00:11:34,605
Rym: cuz think this is a an international flight to the US that takes off in an hour Mm-hmm.

206
00:11:34,645 --> 00:11:35,488
Scott: How far could it be?

207
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:47,060
Scott: It's in the same Airport, uh, Frankfurz Airport is a Gigantic, I mean even if I was in JFK and I was at say terminal 2 and I had to get to like terminal 6 I feel like I could make it in an hour.

208
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,840
Rym: Maybe the problem is that internal air train does not actually run that often.

209
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:59,658
Scott: No But a lot of them have like buses that drive around the airfield run that off and I've been in that boat before and also Even a shitty LaGuardia.

210
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:06,820
Scott: I had to take a bus on the opposite side of security to get between the several terminals and it just worked immediately.

211
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:18,940
Rym: So but the other problem is because it's a flight to the US I have to be checked into the flight Signe like a significant time before it's boarding even like ends and before the gate closes and everything.

212
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:21,175
Rym: Okay, cuz the US is weird about that stuff.

213
00:12:21,497 --> 00:12:24,106
Rym: So I Run at full speed.

214
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,812
Scott: Oh, please stop because you are running.

215
00:12:26,153 --> 00:12:39,265
Rym: Yeah, so no no, so I run at full speed To get on a train to get me part of the way and then I run the rest of the way I get to the Los Fonsa desk and there's a line of people even Waiting for the like.

216
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:43,240
Rym: first-class like you are the most expedited possible person.

217
00:12:43,842 --> 00:12:48,557
Rym: So I talked to some random like employee and I'm like, so here's my situation.

218
00:12:48,617 --> 00:12:52,698
Rym: He said wow Yeah, if you try to wait for this desk, you're just effed.

219
00:12:53,881 --> 00:12:55,911
Rym: Run to terminal Z and they'll deal with it at the gate.

220
00:12:56,313 --> 00:12:59,947
Rym: Okay terminal Z is The last one.

221
00:13:00,409 --> 00:13:01,694
Scott: so I the last one.

222
00:13:01,774 --> 00:13:08,155
Rym: it said I ran Over a mile wearing a suit with all my luggage all the luggage.

223
00:13:08,195 --> 00:13:09,017
Scott: None of it was checked.

224
00:13:09,619 --> 00:13:12,204
Rym: Yes I ran at full speed.

225
00:13:12,484 --> 00:13:14,027
Rym: I am drenched in sweat.

226
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:18,363
Rym: I get to terminal said I Do not have a boarding pass.

227
00:13:18,383 --> 00:13:19,064
Scott: final terminal.

228
00:13:19,084 --> 00:13:19,926
Scott: There's nothing beyond that.

229
00:13:19,946 --> 00:13:20,427
Scott: It's just a hole.

230
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:27,687
Rym: the flight leaves in 25 minutes, that's a lot of time and I have to go through security to get into terminals head.

231
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:35,350
Rym: Oh, okay There is a line for economy There's a line for business class and I see there's a line of like five people for first class.

232
00:13:35,892 --> 00:13:46,928
Rym: So I talked my way past the person who is mad that I don't have a boarding pass To get into the line and I'm in the first class line and it doesn't move for 20 minutes.

233
00:13:48,132 --> 00:13:49,237
Scott: You have five minutes left.

234
00:13:49,257 --> 00:13:50,583
Rym: Yeah, there's no one to talk to.

235
00:13:50,824 --> 00:13:52,090
Rym: the line is just not moving.

236
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,339
Rym: No one will tell us why it's a giant shit.

237
00:13:54,359 --> 00:13:55,303
Rym: show the lines getting.

238
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:57,956
Rym: people come up behind me like hey Can I cut in line?

239
00:13:57,996 --> 00:13:59,989
Rym: my flight takes off in an hour and I'm just like son.

240
00:14:03,036 --> 00:14:03,486
Rym: So, uh.

241
00:14:03,871 --> 00:14:05,782
Rym: Then finally I get to the front.

242
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:06,990
Rym: I go through the security line.

243
00:14:07,351 --> 00:14:10,239
Rym: Like the clock is ticking my first bag comes through.

244
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:18,183
Rym: my second bag comes through my tiny little laptop bag that has nothing in it But like an Amazon Kindle gets shunted off to extra screening.

245
00:14:18,463 --> 00:14:20,570
Rym: Okay, so they pat me down abandon it.

246
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,493
Rym: They pat me down.

247
00:14:21,855 --> 00:14:22,698
Rym: the dude comes over.

248
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,223
Rym: He goes through my bag.

249
00:14:24,243 --> 00:14:26,030
Rym: He pulls everything out and swabs it.

250
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,337
Rym: You know the check for explosives that I know that thing works.

251
00:14:28,818 --> 00:14:30,403
Rym: So yeah, I'm skeptical.

252
00:14:30,945 --> 00:14:37,365
Rym: then he looks at me and He very obviously like hits a button under the desk a bunch of times.

253
00:14:37,826 --> 00:14:39,010
Rym: Mm-hmm and won't say anything.

254
00:14:39,271 --> 00:14:42,550
Rym: Okay, just standing there like won't say a word just keeps hitting this button.

255
00:14:43,392 --> 00:14:47,450
Rym: And then eventually someone comes over and he tries to say to the guy he assumes they don't speak German.

256
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:53,210
Rym: I don't really speak German, but I hear something something something buns police say which is like the German Federal Police.

257
00:14:53,512 --> 00:14:54,156
Rym: Something something.

258
00:14:54,176 --> 00:14:56,610
Rym: buns police say something something buns police say, okay.

259
00:14:56,951 --> 00:15:04,183
Rym: And then I hear behind me and I kind of look and out of the corner of my eye two heavily armed like Army-looking people because you're all sweaty.

260
00:15:04,224 --> 00:15:12,945
Scott: They thought you were nervous So that they thought you were maybe a terrorist Because you were sweaty when it was actually from running and not from nervousness.

261
00:15:12,965 --> 00:15:14,170
Rym: so they stand behind me.

262
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:15,115
Scott: Is that what it was?

263
00:15:15,276 --> 00:15:15,638
Rym: not yet?

264
00:15:15,698 --> 00:15:17,670
Rym: Not quite the sweaty had nothing to do with it.

265
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:21,570
Scott: You had bombs on your hand behind me out of arm's reach.

266
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:26,230
Rym: You got your bowling ball candle and then another an officer comes up in the front this woman.

267
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,234
Rym: They're all heavily armed.

268
00:15:27,254 --> 00:15:30,970
Rym: the people behind me are like guns at the ready, but not pointed at me.

269
00:15:31,171 --> 00:15:38,314
Rym: I'm like they're standing there menacing like and I just pull my hands in my pocket and I just stand there like, okay Let's see what's going down.

270
00:15:38,936 --> 00:15:44,230
Rym: and the guy pulls out my Amazon Kindle like this $40 piece-of-shit tablet and he hands it to her.

271
00:15:44,371 --> 00:15:45,782
Scott: Oh, you're reading a contraband book.

272
00:15:46,225 --> 00:15:52,910
Rym: and he says In German and then he says it again in English after she like looks at me and looks at him.

273
00:15:53,613 --> 00:15:55,582
Rym: It tested positive for explosives.

274
00:15:55,602 --> 00:15:59,355
Rym: He said some kind of expose guy and The buns police.

275
00:15:59,395 --> 00:16:07,630
Rym: a person like looks at him looks at me looks at this tiny shitty Amazon Kindle Rolls her eyes and gestures for me to go make my flight.

276
00:16:09,012 --> 00:16:22,042
Rym: So I run at full speed now Like carrying my like barely packed together shit and I hear people in the distance yelling, New York, New York Run run and I run and I run every telling you to run.

277
00:16:22,122 --> 00:16:23,587
Rym: Yes, I get to the gate.

278
00:16:24,169 --> 00:16:24,570
Rym: There is.

279
00:16:25,812 --> 00:16:27,740
Rym: I literally like get on the plane.

280
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,066
Rym: They close the gate behind me.

281
00:16:29,126 --> 00:16:30,070
Rym: How do you start taking off?

282
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,963
Scott: How did you didn't have a boarding pass though?

283
00:16:32,043 --> 00:16:32,828
Rym: They just dealt with it.

284
00:16:33,735 --> 00:16:35,085
Rym: The plane they're like, okay, so who are you?

285
00:16:36,311 --> 00:16:40,488
Rym: After you got in the plane because it was they'd upgraded me to first class So it was basically no.

286
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:44,370
Scott: How did they know that if you had no boarding pass cuz they were told I was coming?

287
00:16:44,631 --> 00:16:48,370
Rym: Okay, another like 40 people missed this flight because they were all in that line.

288
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:51,470
Rym: Okay, I was the last person to make it on the flight in the flight.

289
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:56,970
Rym: Just fucking wait, there's no because there were a ton of people on that flight who would have missed their connections at JFK.

290
00:16:57,192 --> 00:16:57,768
Scott: Uh-huh.

291
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:02,890
Rym: So I got home three hours early and I was drenched in sweat and I sat down.

292
00:17:03,072 --> 00:17:04,768
Scott: I guess your boss your boss wouldn't have made it.

293
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:09,487
Rym: Nope, my boss saw he barely made it to his flight and got home like three hours later.

294
00:17:09,547 --> 00:17:10,210
Rym: cuz he had the connection.

295
00:17:10,371 --> 00:17:11,294
Rym: I got the good flight home.

296
00:17:11,734 --> 00:17:12,237
Scott: Yeah.

297
00:17:12,257 --> 00:17:13,641
Scott: Well, your boss could probably couldn't run.

298
00:17:13,661 --> 00:17:15,528
Scott: Yeah, you are spry.

299
00:17:15,548 --> 00:17:19,869
Scott: No No one's ever asked me if I was spry but a bicycle in there.

300
00:17:22,314 --> 00:17:23,740
Rym: Okay, let's talk some tech news.

Scott: cuz yeah, if you don't know September is back to school Which is when they used to announce iPods and that was when they announced new iPhones.

304
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:47,149
Scott: They announced iPhone 11s, which seemed to be the same thing as the previous iPhone with a much improved camera yeah, and colors and No, it's just a better iPhone.

305
00:17:47,411 --> 00:17:54,610
Scott: I mean the camera seems way good because it's got several cameras working in tandem plus software post-processing that's automatic and intelligent.

306
00:17:54,831 --> 00:17:59,007
Scott: So it you can take amazing photos without a lot of photo knowledge and skill.

307
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:05,527
Rym: Yep The dual camera system and they're branding that slow you get the three camera system.

308
00:18:05,547 --> 00:18:07,866
Scott: Yeah, yeah You know.

309
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:14,210
Scott: But yeah, why would you buy this iPhone if you if your iPhone is very old?

310
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:20,390
Rym: Yeah, if your iPhone is very dead or very old or you are buying your first iPhone and you don't want to wait.

311
00:18:20,792 --> 00:18:21,395
Scott: I guess that's a good.

312
00:18:21,436 --> 00:18:22,180
Rym: how's the time?

313
00:18:22,421 --> 00:18:23,990
Scott: Well, you know a couple weeks is the time.

314
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:24,898
Rym: Well, yeah now ish.

315
00:18:25,221 --> 00:18:26,170
Scott: Yeah, don't buy an iPhone.

316
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,624
Scott: I mean all the major things are gonna be in the iOS which you're gonna get.

317
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:34,463
Scott: even if you have an iPhone 6 You will still get the newest iOS with all its updates.

318
00:18:34,523 --> 00:18:35,185
Scott: I mean iPhone.

319
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:36,209
Rym: one's not getting that iOS.

320
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,457
Scott: No, I think six is the earliest.

321
00:18:38,598 --> 00:18:40,564
Scott: Yeah, I have iPhone 7 so I'm good.

322
00:18:40,926 --> 00:18:41,889
Rym: Yeah, I saw the.

323
00:18:41,949 --> 00:18:42,952
Rym: apparently I don't know why.

324
00:18:42,972 --> 00:18:45,180
Rym: I'm surprised that this is one of the headlines.

325
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,370
Rym: I'm seeing the new iWatch hasn't always on display.

326
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:49,555
Scott: That's the biggest feature.

327
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:52,930
Scott: The newest Apple watch has is it just not have that before even?

328
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:58,846
Scott: Well, I just moved my arm so you can see my Apple watch is displaying something.

329
00:18:58,907 --> 00:19:01,254
Scott: but here look look at it now Look, it's just dark.

330
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:03,179
Scott: Yeah, you have mine and my.

331
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:09,199
Rym: all my Android watches have always had the option of show nothing or Show a lighter like limited version.

332
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,706
Rym: Oh, I mean you could turn.

333
00:19:10,726 --> 00:19:20,950
Scott: you could turn the brightness down But yeah, the the Apple watch you cannot unless you have the newest one Which has I guess superior battery and I guess less more energy efficient display.

334
00:19:21,852 --> 00:19:23,321
Scott: It turns off in order to see.

335
00:19:23,342 --> 00:19:26,739
Scott: to get something to show up on the screen You got to shake your arm or pick your arm up.

336
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:30,257
Scott: You can't just sort of look out the corner of your eye You'll just see a black screen.

337
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:31,364
Rym: I'm just saying with Android.

338
00:19:31,384 --> 00:19:32,430
Rym: I've always been able to do that.

339
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,297
Scott: Yeah, well, that's why those watches are crappier.

340
00:19:34,357 --> 00:19:38,110
Scott: Even if I got the newest Apple watch I would turn off the always-on display.

341
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:39,821
Scott: So I actually experiment.

342
00:19:39,861 --> 00:19:41,270
Rym: because I have a new smartwatch.

343
00:19:41,651 --> 00:19:41,972
Rym: I left.

344
00:19:42,073 --> 00:19:42,394
Rym: I turned.

345
00:19:42,454 --> 00:19:44,040
Rym: I left that on because it's on by default.

346
00:19:44,381 --> 00:19:46,067
Rym: Batteries still last all day.

347
00:19:46,087 --> 00:19:46,990
Scott: You're hurting the main bit.

348
00:19:47,292 --> 00:19:48,720
Scott: Yeah, we'll talk about that later.

349
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:49,867
Scott: But yeah, there's not really.

350
00:19:50,128 --> 00:19:55,062
Scott: it's like They really did not have a lot of new features going on here.

351
00:19:55,082 --> 00:19:57,770
Scott: I don't even know why this really wasn't even keynote worthy.

352
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:02,810
Scott: I feel like they just had to do it because they always do it in September to try to sell their phones.

353
00:20:03,432 --> 00:20:06,003
Scott: But it's like, you know, no one's by.

354
00:20:06,084 --> 00:20:07,590
Scott: you know that no one's buying your phones.

355
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:15,710
Scott: You talked about how no one's buying your phones and then you have a chance to put out new phones and you don't make any major new feature or thing.

356
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:20,270
Scott: Well, because I makes it so people need like really badly to go in up.

357
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,436
Scott: It's like before.

358
00:20:21,456 --> 00:20:22,702
Scott: it'd be like oh new iPhone.

359
00:20:22,802 --> 00:20:23,204
Scott: Ah shit.

360
00:20:23,245 --> 00:20:24,330
Scott: My car and iPhone is garbage.

361
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,614
Scott: Look how much better the.

362
00:20:25,854 --> 00:20:28,381
Scott: the difference between the iPhone 5 and iPhone 4 is.

363
00:20:28,421 --> 00:20:30,046
Scott: the problem is different.

364
00:20:30,066 --> 00:20:34,856
Rym: There are not like Features that are feasible.

365
00:20:34,976 --> 00:20:38,468
Rym: that would be a massive shift in smartphone technology right now.

366
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:42,061
Scott: They're also Removing a feature which is amazing.

367
00:20:42,081 --> 00:20:42,904
Rym: what the headphone jack?

368
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:44,269
Scott: No, that's been removed.

369
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:47,837
Rym: Headphone jack.

370
00:20:47,897 --> 00:20:49,005
Scott: I don't need to have fun.

371
00:20:49,025 --> 00:20:53,050
Scott: J. Anyway The they added a feature.

372
00:20:53,271 --> 00:21:00,810
Scott: It's really funny because it took them years to develop this feature The ability for touch the touch screens to figure out how hard you're pressing.

373
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:03,861
Scott: They've had this for years on iPhones, right?

374
00:21:04,182 --> 00:21:05,710
Scott: It took them many years to come up with it.

375
00:21:06,251 --> 00:21:07,154
Scott: And so you it.

376
00:21:07,234 --> 00:21:11,427
Scott: there are certain things where like you press hard and you can get like a context menu, right?

377
00:21:11,969 --> 00:21:16,170
Scott: But You can do the same thing by just pressing for a while.

378
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:22,249
Scott: Yeah but also my problem with that is that pressing hard you can just press for like a few seconds and then open so context.

379
00:21:22,269 --> 00:21:31,022
Rym: my As a UX professional and very leery of any mass-market like comp like daily use device having pressure Sensitivity honest.

380
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:32,110
Scott: No, that wasn't the problem.

381
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:37,190
Scott: The problem is there was no way to tell which things you could press hard on to get different options.

382
00:21:37,351 --> 00:21:41,074
Scott: Oh, so basically no one ever pressed hard No one ever did it ever.

383
00:21:41,555 --> 00:21:53,570
Rym: and then now they're just removing the press hard ability and replacing it with pressing for a long time which is smart because Watching adults like people who are slightly older than us and kids use their smartphones a lot.

384
00:21:53,690 --> 00:22:01,419
Rym: One thing I've noticed is that most people have terrible manual dexterity and you're lucky They're even capable of hitting the icons on there.

385
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:06,776
Scott: so that you know, I think it's just that Apple loves To Everything.

386
00:22:06,977 --> 00:22:11,690
Scott: All right, they don't want to have displayed contract They don't want to have buttons and they don't want to have clutter.

387
00:22:12,111 --> 00:22:17,549
Scott: So they end up in the UI having like hidden mystery features like to lock your home your screen.

388
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:20,270
Scott: on your Mac You move your mouse into the corner, right?

389
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:26,450
Scott: You know as it's like everything's always try to make these invisible controls or you know things like that.

390
00:22:26,692 --> 00:22:38,610
Scott: Oh, it's like, you know Sometimes that becomes elegant because you manage to learn the thing you use it and their interface isn't Cluttered and it works out great and other times it's just fucking hidden and no one knows the buttons.

391
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:40,749
Scott: They're like a fucking kaizo block in Mario.

392
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:48,546
Scott: Sometimes you bump into a accident and like whoa and sometimes I just start using that as an anti pattern.

393
00:22:48,606 --> 00:22:49,248
Rym: kaizo block.

394
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:49,990
Rym: kaizo design.

395
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,555
Rym: It's a kaizo blocks.

396
00:22:51,695 --> 00:22:52,417
Scott: That's what they are.

397
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:53,922
Scott: But yeah, there's really like.

398
00:22:54,443 --> 00:22:56,550
Scott: they're coming out with the Apple arcade, right?

399
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:01,063
Scott: Yeah, so it's basically a cheap subscription service where you get a bunch of like.

400
00:23:01,123 --> 00:23:05,513
Scott: it's like a Netflix of video games for iOS and Apple TV Really cheap.

401
00:23:06,015 --> 00:23:07,923
Scott: So I guess that makes it okay because it's cheap.

402
00:23:08,365 --> 00:23:13,633
Rym: but going into beta Yeah, and it's not even listed as one of the top five announcements No, but it's like.

403
00:23:13,813 --> 00:23:26,789
Scott: I guess if you're the kind of person who like isn't like, you know hardcore in the games You're like maybe uh, you know someone who's a candy crush kind of person But you want variety and you're candy crushing instead of just playing any crush over and over again.

404
00:23:27,553 --> 00:23:33,438
Scott: Or maybe you got some kids and they're not you know, like Console or PC gaming kids.

405
00:23:33,719 --> 00:23:38,717
Scott: They're just tablet gaming kids, right, you know, they Maybe it's good for them.

406
00:23:38,737 --> 00:23:41,410
Scott: I don't know who this is for but at least it's cheap.

407
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:45,069
Scott: so I think the cheapness actually gets people in the door, but it's like.

408
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:48,759
Scott: Even gaming sites hardly cover iOS.

409
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:49,360
Rym: Yes.

410
00:23:49,882 --> 00:23:56,301
Scott: It's like, you know and every time Apple has a keynote It feels like every single time they always show a game.

411
00:23:56,462 --> 00:24:00,930
Scott: ever since way back when they showed, you know You know, was it Doom 3?

412
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:03,299
Scott: Yeah, John Carmichael's in the stage and they were showing Nvidia.

413
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:06,490
Scott: and it's like they keep showing games at Apple keynotes.

414
00:24:06,931 --> 00:24:11,808
Scott: And then after that keynote, no one ever fucking talks about the games on Apple devices.

415
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:12,530
Scott: ever fucking again.

416
00:24:12,591 --> 00:24:13,982
Scott: You never hear about that game ever.

417
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:21,782
Scott: Yeah, right Like I feel like there was a racing game they talked about at a recent not the current one But like maybe a year or maybe two year ago.

418
00:24:21,802 --> 00:24:23,890
Scott: You haven't heard shit about that racing game.

419
00:24:23,971 --> 00:24:26,669
Scott: I'm sure it's out and you can play it but no one's fucking talking about that.

420
00:24:26,992 --> 00:24:31,790
Scott: What's sad though is that games At WODC this year they talked about a bunch of iOS games.

421
00:24:32,031 --> 00:24:33,033
Scott: No one's talking about those fucking games.

422
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:40,809
Rym: Games are one of the few things on smartphones that would actually require a lot of the power We're building into these devices to do something cool.

423
00:24:40,972 --> 00:24:43,839
Scott: Well, cuz that's you know They mostly use the game as a way to talk about it.

424
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:44,622
Scott: the phones guess what.

425
00:24:44,642 --> 00:24:46,690
Scott: they're faster and have longer battery life.

426
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:47,656
Scott: It's like okay.

427
00:24:47,676 --> 00:24:50,130
Scott: Well, they're already fast enough and have long enough battery life.

428
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:56,089
Scott: Yeah, and unlike a PC where like there are going to be newer applications that require there's more power.

429
00:24:57,151 --> 00:25:01,870
Scott: Not so on my phone, you know, I the phone runs Twitter just fine.

430
00:25:02,513 --> 00:25:06,530
Scott: I don't need a faster phone CPU for a faster Twitter, right?

431
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,950
Scott: And then they're doing their Apple TV plus thing, which is old news.

432
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:13,610
Rym: Five bucks in a month slightly cheaper.

433
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:20,462
Scott: I think you know what that way we got to say is if you have if your phone is Busted or you getting an iPhone for the first time.

434
00:25:20,482 --> 00:25:22,390
Scott: Yeah get the new one that's coming out in a few weeks.

435
00:25:22,872 --> 00:25:28,214
Scott: Otherwise the rumor is new iPhone SE Early next year.

436
00:25:28,234 --> 00:25:29,899
Scott: Hopefully the small iPhone.

437
00:25:29,939 --> 00:25:31,745
Scott: Hopefully that that will be the real deal.

438
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:36,197
Scott: Yep, if that doesn't happen I'm gonna wait all the way until next September.

439
00:25:36,598 --> 00:25:52,269
Scott: the iPhone 12 is supposed to see is gonna hopefully be USB-c because and also a major leap in other areas and You know any improvement they made with the iPhone 11. however minor iPhone 12 is obviously gonna be better in every way.

440
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:57,570
Scott: That's gonna have at least the same camera and at least the same CPU and it or cameras.

441
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,818
Scott: So like yeah, probably ten cameras.

442
00:25:59,838 --> 00:26:02,950
Scott: who the fuck knows one Gillette model who knows what the hell it is.

443
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:05,265
Scott: But it'll obviously be better in every way.

444
00:26:05,386 --> 00:26:09,021
Scott: So Hopefully my iPhone 7 can hold out another year.

445
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:17,930
Scott: But the thing is I think even if I reach those iPhone 12s and they come out and my iPhone 7 is still going strong, right?

446
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:28,331
Scott: I might be then Even if I don't really like the cut of the iPhone 12 jib be forced to get that the smallest iPhone 12.

447
00:26:28,331 --> 00:26:33,030
Scott: Yeah, because 5g will become a real thing and that will be a significant feature.

448
00:26:33,612 --> 00:26:34,154
Rym: We'll see.

449
00:26:34,235 --> 00:26:35,439
Rym: because the problem with 5g.

450
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,030
Scott: 5g is not a real thing in my iPhone 7 still works.

451
00:26:38,155 --> 00:26:47,338
Rym: Oh, baby My problem with 5g is solely that I don't have any use cases for it other than Potentially a use case that I doubt will work.

452
00:26:47,418 --> 00:26:50,286
Scott: use case is live faster faster treatment.

453
00:26:50,887 --> 00:26:51,810
Rym: I'm already fast.

454
00:26:51,971 --> 00:26:53,057
Rym: I'm as fast as now.

455
00:26:53,097 --> 00:26:53,962
Scott: you can treat even 5g.

456
00:26:54,183 --> 00:26:55,470
Scott: you can see real fast.

457
00:26:55,630 --> 00:27:02,150
Rym: What 5g would let me do would be to like use the phone to live stream like panels we do at conventions.

458
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:04,173
Scott: I mean you could do yeah You could do all kinds of.

459
00:27:04,214 --> 00:27:07,570
Rym: the problem is 4g is fast enough to do that.

460
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:15,370
Rym: The problem is that at any convention the 4g cannot work Using old TV UHF band?

461
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:22,470
Rym: Ah, but the problem is It's powerful 5g still have that amount of bandwidth and for the amount of money Verizon's gonna charge me for it.

462
00:27:22,551 --> 00:27:24,026
Scott: If I get it it better fucking.

463
00:27:24,087 --> 00:27:24,309
Scott: yeah.

464
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:27,165
Rym: But will it be at a convention when there's an extra 100,000 people?

465
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:30,659
Scott: So you can do it there.

466
00:27:31,001 --> 00:27:35,505
Rym: Oh, yeah, we could just dream on the Wi-Fi But again, I don't have a use for 5g all that.

467
00:27:35,545 --> 00:27:36,470
Rym: Well, here's my problem.

468
00:27:37,011 --> 00:27:45,680
Rym: Everyone in the industry talking about 5g are really selling these kind of bullshitty use cases that are really Overvaluing what 5g will do.

469
00:27:45,721 --> 00:27:49,636
Rym: Make an app that uses 5g Yeah, but everything everyone's talking about our own.

470
00:27:49,656 --> 00:27:54,490
Rym: we can do more Internet of Things things which bandwidth is not the limitation on Internet of Things.

471
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,113
Scott: No, it is not All right.

472
00:27:57,154 --> 00:28:01,650
Scott: Anyway, that's your Apple news for September 2017. check back I guess.

473
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:06,790
Scott: WWDC next year early next year for iPhone SE news and we had some other news.

474
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:18,956
Rym: I think we'll skip it and get into the main bit cuz we talked a while and it's time for Things of the day.

475
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:19,499
Rym: What do you got?

476
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:22,110
Scott: So for once I've got the rollercoaster thing of the day.

477
00:28:23,591 --> 00:28:25,176
Scott: Rym's always a rollercoaster person.

478
00:28:25,517 --> 00:28:26,260
Scott: I got one now.

479
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,483
Scott: It's a real short video.

480
00:28:27,865 --> 00:28:29,590
Scott: The video originally had stupid music.

481
00:28:29,811 --> 00:28:34,910
Scott: Thankfully, it seems YouTube copyright has removed that music except for the first two seconds of the video.

482
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:39,623
Scott: Yep, so you are spared from the the you know pointless music over the top.

483
00:28:40,224 --> 00:28:42,210
Scott: Anyway, all this is a real simple video.

484
00:28:42,711 --> 00:28:44,517
Scott: It's a video of someone riding a rollercoaster.

485
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:48,330
Scott: So it's not too often people video themselves riding a rollercoaster, right?

486
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:52,010
Scott: So that's already the odds of this video existing or you're pretty low.

487
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:56,850
Scott: Most times a rollercoaster runs people don't take and record and save the video, right?

488
00:28:58,191 --> 00:29:04,930
Scott: Especially not video of facing at the people's faces - it seems like this is pretty common.

489
00:29:05,251 --> 00:29:11,010
Scott: Someone riding a rollercoaster stupidly with their phone loses their phone and it goes flying and never to be seen again.

490
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:12,488
Scott: That happens a lot.

491
00:29:13,353 --> 00:29:17,829
Scott: What are the odds that someone would be riding a rollercoaster with a camera facing them?

492
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:26,219
Scott: Recording someone in front of them would lose their phone and the person being recorded by the video would catch Phone is amazing.

493
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:32,949
Scott: Not only it's amazing that the person even caught the phone but the odds of it being captured on video so well are so low.

494
00:29:32,969 --> 00:29:36,297
Scott: it's Definitely doesn't seem fake to me.

495
00:29:36,337 --> 00:29:36,478
Scott: Yep.

496
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:39,990
Scott: I'm usually the first person to say fake doctored video.

497
00:29:40,331 --> 00:29:42,058
Scott: This really seems real to me.

498
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:46,697
Scott: It's really great way to spend the next 45.

499
00:29:46,697 --> 00:29:49,166
Rym: Nobody would have believed that if there wasn't video.

500
00:29:49,487 --> 00:30:00,830
Scott: Yeah Considering how much change and how many sunglasses I've been hitting the face with over Nobody because nobody would think to fake this video and if they did it wouldn't look like the way this video looks.

501
00:30:01,072 --> 00:30:03,149
Rym: You know what if someone did think to fake this?

502
00:30:04,172 --> 00:30:05,095
Rym: My head is off to you.

503
00:30:05,115 --> 00:30:08,308
Scott: You know, if you thought to fake it and faked it this.

504
00:30:08,428 --> 00:30:12,068
Scott: well All every hat I have ever owned is off to you.

505
00:30:14,455 --> 00:30:15,222
Scott: Score three goals.

506
00:30:15,302 --> 00:30:16,069
Scott: we can have all the hats.

507
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:21,970
Rym: So my thing of the day because most of my things I've been kind of rotating through these same five genres lately.

508
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,376
Rym: So I wanted something very different.

509
00:30:23,817 --> 00:30:26,950
Rym: So this is my most favorite recent Twitter account.

510
00:30:27,371 --> 00:30:30,560
Rym: Yeah, I'm a fan of those Twitter accounts that do something very specific.

511
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:42,144
Rym: Scary toilet, cursed cons, toilets with threatening auras Yeah, cursed rhythm game controllers Yeah, but this one is near and dear to me because it is cropped boomer.

512
00:30:42,164 --> 00:30:43,648
Scott: Have you seen horny fight sticks?

513
00:30:43,768 --> 00:30:44,430
Scott: Yes, okay.

514
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:51,110
Rym: But So cropped boomer images is very specific.

515
00:30:51,270 --> 00:31:05,583
Rym: it takes those memes that your racist Nazi like distant relative keeps posting on Facebook and The rule is they will take one of those Facebook conservative racist Whatever memes and all they will do is crop it to make it.

516
00:31:05,884 --> 00:31:07,730
Scott: so make no other edits besides cropping.

517
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:18,210
Rym: Yep, all they're allowed to do is crop one crop not like several crops in a collage one crop one crop only and The results are kind of amazing.

518
00:31:19,352 --> 00:31:21,550
Rym: I'm just gonna just you just gotta go look at these.

519
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:22,327
Rym: You'll see what I mean.

520
00:31:22,812 --> 00:31:24,600
Rym: And I feel like what I want to start doing.

521
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:29,861
Rym: is any of you who have a crappy Relative who post this kind of stuff every time they do?

522
00:31:30,182 --> 00:31:32,490
Rym: take one of these tweets and respond to them with it.

523
00:31:33,931 --> 00:31:37,899
Scott: You didn't like my one crop only joke One crop only.

524
00:31:38,201 --> 00:31:42,978
Rym: the shits gonna get out of hand All right in the meta moment.

525
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:45,125
Rym: You may have noticed we didn't do shows for two weeks.

526
00:31:45,848 --> 00:31:46,490
Rym: So we're back.

527
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:47,554
Rym: We're gonna be doing shows.

Rym: Philly is not that bad as bad.

546
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:37,133
Rym: Philly is one of the bigger cities in America by far It doesn't.

547
00:32:37,153 --> 00:32:38,018
Scott: it doesn't matter.

548
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:39,950
Scott: if it was the biggest it would still be shitty.

549
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,659
Rym: All right, would you rather live in Philly or Frankfurt?

550
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,262
Scott: Frankfurt?

551
00:32:43,442 --> 00:32:47,803

00:32:55,971 --> 00:32:59,321
Scott: Yeah, really really New Jersey or Philadelphia easily.

554
00:32:59,622 --> 00:33:02,270
Rym: I would rather live in Philly than literally anywhere in New Jersey.

00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:11,636

00:33:13,101 --> 00:33:22,658
Scott: the mega fest mag year man, New Year's is on New Year's Day is what Tuesday and Magfest begins Thursday.

00:33:37,631 --> 00:33:39,077
Scott: Then Thursday magfest.

565
00:33:39,297 --> 00:33:42,710
Rym: it used to be that fall was always the time where summer ended and school started.

566
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:49,710
Rym: But now thanks to a clustering of all the conventions we perform at fall is when convention season starts for Rym and Scott.

567
00:33:50,191 --> 00:33:52,258
Rym: It's like September through March.

568
00:33:52,318 --> 00:33:56,169
Rym: We're doing conventions and then we don't really do many the rest of the year.

569
00:33:57,331 --> 00:34:00,461
Rym: We once again forgot to even submit anything to anime NYC.

570
00:34:00,923 --> 00:34:03,070
Rym: No, I want to go over here and I just forget.

571
00:34:04,272 --> 00:34:06,930
Rym: Also, I haven't written any new anime content in a long.

572
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:10,882
Scott: Anyway, the book club selection is a book that I started reading a little bit.

573
00:34:10,962 --> 00:34:11,402
Scott: It's long.

574
00:34:11,563 --> 00:34:13,630
Scott: Yeah, it is the tale of Genji.

575
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:21,208
Scott: I wonder if we could like maybe figure out which volume was the first volume and only read that because it was several volumes over a long time.

576
00:34:21,672 --> 00:34:23,063
Rym: Scott on a bridge ads.

577
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:29,205
Scott: I know on a bridge I feel like what we gotta get the honor bridge deluxe edition of the tale of Genji by Murasage Shikibu.

578
00:34:29,326 --> 00:34:34,293
Scott: It is the first Novel in human history Period.

579
00:34:34,313 --> 00:34:38,370
Scott: there were other fictional literature before them, but they were not novels.

580
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:41,505
Scott: They were like epic tales or novel.

581
00:34:41,645 --> 00:34:42,469
Scott: smaller thing.

582
00:34:43,893 --> 00:34:46,128
Scott: There were no novels before this book.

583
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,185
Scott: Arguably, yep, pretty much.

584
00:34:49,225 --> 00:34:49,608
Scott: It's the first.

585
00:34:49,668 --> 00:34:56,389
Rym: now I feel like as we start really reading it will like we'll sort of Occasionally talk about it because it'll be a while before we do a booklet book on it.

586
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:59,547
Rym: I encourage you to read this along with us starting now ish.

587
00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:05,485
Rym: Yep Otherwise, that's it We're gonna actually be doubling down on content again.

588
00:35:05,525 --> 00:35:09,981
Rym: now that we're back Most of our big life changes and moving and traveling.

589
00:35:10,001 --> 00:35:12,729
Rym: everything are gonna calm down other than conventions in a couple weeks.

590
00:35:12,889 --> 00:35:14,798
Rym: Yep So, uh, stay tuned.

591
00:35:14,838 --> 00:35:17,148
Scott: mostly October and November are gonna be normal.

592
00:35:17,651 --> 00:35:22,130
Scott: But of course November always has a lot of Thanksgiving shit going on and October has the Halloween shit.

593
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:29,249
Rym: But there will be no like unexpected or unplanned like big hiatuses for a while and then December is gonna be unplugged.

594
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:32,019
Scott: Holidays mag here packs out.

595
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:34,910
Scott: Yeah, then a quiet period then PAX East again already.

596
00:35:35,179 --> 00:35:44,330
Rym: Yep The good news is and then fucking summer while we tend to skip a lot of shows during that time of the year We make up for it by having a shit ton of panels to put on YouTube.

597
00:35:44,591 --> 00:35:48,470
Rym: Yeah, and it's usually that's when we're doing all the new stuff that we haven't done before.

598
00:35:48,831 --> 00:35:50,597
Scott: Anyway, let's let's see starting to.

599
00:35:50,617 --> 00:35:51,621
Scott: you know, whatever.

600
00:35:51,781 --> 00:35:52,042
Rym: Yep.

601
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:56,018
Scott: So smartwatch Campbell it We definitely did a show on this that you deleted.

602
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,430
Rym: Uh, so Scott, I guess we got to back up.

603
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:01,089
Rym: This is not like a review of the iWatch or anything.

604
00:36:02,771 --> 00:36:05,510
Rym: What is a smartwatch and why should we care?

605
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:10,105
Scott: Well, I mean a watch is a thing is a relic from an ancient age.

606
00:36:10,165 --> 00:36:11,650
Rym: Yes, that's relegated to history.

607
00:36:12,232 --> 00:36:15,903
Scott: I am NOT a fan of what I mean, I enjoy the crest.

608
00:36:16,004 --> 00:36:18,010
Scott: it is a very nerdy and respectable thing.

609
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:22,954
Scott: You know to make watches right and the craftsmanship of watches I have high respect for.

610
00:36:23,395 --> 00:36:38,510
Scott: right to just take some fucking gears and a small power source Whether it's you know a mechanical wound-up spring or whatever It is a battery right and somehow create a device that will keep perfect or close to perfect time.

611
00:36:38,591 --> 00:36:43,038
Scott: That is incredibly small and intricate is Worthy of much praise.

612
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:55,303
Scott: Yeah, but the culture of people who Collect spend as much money on watches as people would spend on cars and do all sorts of other Wear giant fucking gaudy ass watches on their wrist.

613
00:36:55,423 --> 00:36:59,536
Rym: Yeah, right be wearing a giant chronometer Like yeah, what do you use?

614
00:36:59,857 --> 00:37:03,850
Scott: Oh, you know, they have the watch, you know good to a zillion meters diving watch.

615
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:16,874
Scott: You never go in the water with it ever right or like, you know, you see Odell Beckham jr Who's you know sent to the the Cleveland Browns is wearing like a watch that several hundred thousand dollars while playing football Which is against the rules.

616
00:37:17,014 --> 00:37:18,158
Scott: even you're not allowed to.

617
00:37:18,178 --> 00:37:21,450
Scott: but we ignore hate that watch culture.

618
00:37:21,731 --> 00:37:35,210
Rym: But we're talking about this from a technology standpoint solely and in technology the wristwatch Much like the pocket watch were made entirely obsolete by the smartphone except in very specific circumstances for many years.

619
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:40,026
Scott: So in my earliest days, I mean I had you know, like time X Y Mickey Mouse watch.

620
00:37:40,066 --> 00:37:41,849
Scott: Yep, learn how to tell time That's a great one.

621
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:46,070
Rym: I wore watches when I was young because oftentimes there was no way to know what time it was.

622
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:51,761
Rym: Otherwise, yeah, then as you were in school where there's a clock in every room Yep, then I had time X watch which is that?

623
00:37:51,781 --> 00:37:53,409
Scott: the two buttons on the front Iron Man one?

624
00:37:53,952 --> 00:37:57,466
Scott: Which is a great watch because it had also a little alarm right and I would.

625
00:37:57,747 --> 00:38:01,650
Scott: it has stopwatch Which you would play with when you're a kid, but it wasn't really useful for much.

626
00:38:01,871 --> 00:38:09,663
Rym: The one thing I did I always used a watch with a sweeping secondhand always Even when I was very young not the ticking kind.

627
00:38:09,743 --> 00:38:10,790
Rym: Nope ticking kind sucks.

628
00:38:10,972 --> 00:38:11,825
Scott: I like the digital kind

629
00:38:11,947 --> 00:38:26,949
Rym: sweep Yeah but sweeping kind for a reason because what I did in school all through elementary school all through middle school is I would figure out the Timing and when the bells would actually ring and I would synchronize my watch to that exactly So I would know the exact instant the bell would ring.

630
00:38:27,432 --> 00:38:33,490
Rym: So occasionally I could do funny things like in a random class in middle school Get up and start walking toward the door.

631
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:36,120
Rym: The teacher just would be about to be like hey worry.

632
00:38:36,161 --> 00:38:45,119
Rym: and then the bell would ring just as I get to the threshold of The room like I do that with a ticking secondhand also Yeah, but the ticking secondhand watches tended to not be as accurate.

633
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:52,668
Scott: Anyway, anyway, the point is once you had smartphones We're now carrying or even not even smartphones just cell phones Yeah.

634
00:38:52,710 --> 00:39:00,459
Scott: And like Motorola star tech phone and especially ones that had a little tiny display on the outside like my little Samsung or LG Whatever the fuck it was my old flip my little.

635
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,710
Rym: it would last like a week unless I talk.

636
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:05,150
Scott: I had a little flippy phone had the time on the outside.

637
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:09,650
Scott: So now I don't need a fucking thing on my wrist anymore, especially since I always lose the wrist watches.

638
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:13,241
Rym: Anyway, because now basically everyone effectively had a pocket watch.

639
00:39:13,341 --> 00:39:14,906
Rym: Yep, whether they wanted one or not.

640
00:39:14,966 --> 00:39:16,210
Rym: You just had a pocket watch.

641
00:39:16,291 --> 00:39:17,722
Scott: So now what's the point of fucking watches?

642
00:39:17,743 --> 00:39:18,307
Scott: You don't need those.

643
00:39:18,428 --> 00:39:18,570
Rym: Yep.

644
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:22,830
Rym: So basically as soon as I got a cell phone, I took my watch off and I never wore a watch again, right?

645
00:39:23,231 --> 00:39:35,920
Scott: But then what you know, we had this problem that came up later Which we had smartphones and all kinds of notifications coming in And even though I managed my notifications very heavily as much as I manage like my email filters So hardly any notifications happen.

646
00:39:36,202 --> 00:39:37,550
Scott: the ones that do happen are important.

647
00:39:37,871 --> 00:39:50,790
Scott: So when my wife my phone goes ding I take it out of my pocket and look at it and for several years That's what I was doing iPhone 3g 4 5 6 I was taking my phone out of my pocket every time it went ding to see what the hell it was.

648
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:52,542
Rym: Which is a little bit of a problem, right?

649
00:39:52,582 --> 00:39:57,081
Scott: Even if it's something important It's kind of annoying to read, you know, constantly be taking the phone or

650
00:39:57,101 --> 00:40:07,382
Rym: importantly not in necessarily for us all the time But definitely for a lot of people once you take the phone out to look at that Notification and for security you probably got to unlock the phone before you see the notification.

651
00:40:07,442 --> 00:40:09,668
Rym: Yeah, otherwise people can steal your 2fa codes.

652
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:15,550
Rym: Yep Now Twitter's right there and maybe it checks something you know poking at your phone.

653
00:40:15,651 --> 00:40:18,670
Scott: Also, you've now turned the screen on on your phone killing its battery.

654
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:24,590
Rym: Yeah, and until recently smartwap smartphones batteries didn't often last all day if you use them, right?

655
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:25,513
Scott: So this is so.

656
00:40:26,276 --> 00:40:27,501
Scott: when the pebble watch came out.

657
00:40:27,602 --> 00:40:28,244
Scott: I was like hell.

658
00:40:28,284 --> 00:40:28,566
Scott: yes.

659
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:29,650
Scott: This is the thing I want.

660
00:40:29,771 --> 00:40:36,403
Rym: It is a watch right but the fact that it's hold time was like Literally the last feature I gave it shit about.

661
00:40:36,484 --> 00:40:37,730
Scott: oh, I had a whole bunch of features.

662
00:40:37,931 --> 00:40:40,381
Scott: You can even get games on there customize the software.

663
00:40:40,461 --> 00:40:53,292
Scott: It was nice to be able to customize the screen stuff But the main feature the only one I cared about was that I would get Notifications on the watch so I could if it went ding I could look at the watch and not have to take my phone out Of my pocket.

664
00:40:53,332 --> 00:40:56,044
Scott: Yep, not taking the phone out of the pocket means saving battery.

665
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,490
Scott: It means saving time.

666
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:04,510
Scott: It means saving a lot of things worth going back to having a watch on my wrist And that's literally take it out of the pocket to look at the time.

667
00:41:04,891 --> 00:41:09,445
Rym: I don't need to use my watch to like look at a map or watch a movie or any.

668
00:41:09,525 --> 00:41:17,370
Rym: I just wanted it to give me Notifications because if I was going to do anything from there I will get my phone out because now I'm actually gonna use my phone like a little computer.

669
00:41:18,111 --> 00:41:22,070
Rym: The only other thing I cared about was you know, I run a lot and I do a lot of sports.

670
00:41:22,412 --> 00:41:24,563
Rym: I like to be able to use Strava and things to track my runs.

671
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:25,990
Rym: I use the smartwatch.

672
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:34,379
Rym: I don't even need a watch that on its own will do GPS partly because they tend to be not that good at it Even the fancy ones compared to a phone for reasons.

673
00:41:34,419 --> 00:41:36,185
Rym: I don't want to get into right now about antennas.

674
00:41:36,326 --> 00:41:36,627
Scott: I'll do it.

675
00:41:38,911 --> 00:42:01,950
Rym: Well, we'll get into that when we talk is even the fancy smartwatches tend to be a little less accurate than also having the phone In your pocket, but I wanted to be able to just hit a button on my watch and then immediately start running Instead of like carrying my like pulling my phone out of my pocket Starting the Strava putting the phone into like that I can't keep in my pocket when I'm running so putting in like an arm strap or something.

676
00:42:02,432 --> 00:42:03,396
Rym: So I wanted to be able to.

677
00:42:03,537 --> 00:42:09,741
Rym: I basically just wanted my wrist to have a screen for Notifications with a couple of buttons to trigger things on my phone.

678
00:42:09,922 --> 00:42:10,102
Rym: Mm-hmm.

679
00:42:10,182 --> 00:42:10,503
Rym: That's it.

680
00:42:10,744 --> 00:42:10,905
Rym: Yep.

681
00:42:11,126 --> 00:42:12,350
Rym: The pebble was enough.

682
00:42:12,631 --> 00:42:16,044
Rym: Yep, the pebble still I think is the best smartwatch anyone ever made.

683
00:42:16,064 --> 00:42:17,409
Scott: Well, because it's wisely, right?

684
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:18,071
Scott: It's like.

685
00:42:18,091 --> 00:42:20,061
Scott: yeah, I really like the OLED screens.

686
00:42:20,382 --> 00:42:22,050
Scott: OLED is the best screen you can get.

687
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:25,344
Scott: It's really nice on the Apple watch, but I don't need the OLED.

688
00:42:25,384 --> 00:42:28,014
Scott: I want the OLED screen on my phone Every other thing.

689
00:42:28,034 --> 00:42:29,338
Scott: I want an OLED TV.

690
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:31,163
Scott: I want OLED computer monitors.

691
00:42:31,244 --> 00:42:33,350
Scott: I don't want I don't need the OLED on the watch.

692
00:42:33,411 --> 00:42:34,709
Scott: It doesn't make a big difference there.

693
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:39,610
Scott: If a smartwatch, I would rather have the LCD crapo screen of the pebble on my wrist.

694
00:42:39,911 --> 00:42:48,436
Rym: So if a smartwatch is designed to be a screen for notifications and maybe a place to have some buttons to trigger things Then what's the user experience?

695
00:42:48,697 --> 00:42:50,803
Rym: You need the battery to last for fucking ever.

696
00:42:50,823 --> 00:42:53,370
Rym: Mm-hmm, and you'd like the screen to always be on.

697
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,235
Rym: Yep, that's something the pebble did.

698
00:42:55,596 --> 00:43:06,730
Rym: but when I watches and Android wear watches and all these sort of real smartwatches came into the Market, let's not talk about pure fitness devices because you know, this is I don't get it's kind of out of scope for this.

699
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:17,194
Rym: Then if I feel like the entire industry was trying to shoehorn all these other use cases That weren't why actually useful to people I think that's the thing.

700
00:43:17,215 --> 00:43:21,494
Scott: is you even you know, like I was just talking about the new iPhone 11 It's like they.

701
00:43:21,775 --> 00:43:24,562
Scott: I feel like they've never actually known like.

702
00:43:24,944 --> 00:43:27,230
Scott: what things are people actually gonna use.

703
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:27,973
Scott: We don't know.

704
00:43:28,034 --> 00:43:29,581
Scott: Well, let's make every feature.

705
00:43:29,621 --> 00:43:34,944
Scott: We possibly can make every app We possibly can and just see what people use.

706
00:43:34,984 --> 00:43:39,080
Scott: Yeah, it's like oh shit The thing people use most on their phone is like the camera.

707
00:43:39,201 --> 00:43:41,008
Scott: All right, let's focus on that.

708
00:43:41,129 --> 00:43:52,890
Scott: Yep Yeah, so that's what's happened with watches is they're in that phase where it's like let's make the watch do every possible Conceivable thing that we can imagine and see which ones people actually end up using.

709
00:43:53,312 --> 00:44:02,750
Rym: But the problem with that is that as a result you have all these half-baked Experiences or these things that aren't actually that useful which almost drive people away from smartwatches.

710
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:13,680
Rym: I've seen so many people get a smartwatch like in the early generations and then decide that it doesn't do like the the the Capabilities they were sold aren't really that useful.

711
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:16,790
Rym: and then they decide smartwatches aren't useful and they stop wearing.

712
00:44:16,931 --> 00:44:17,714
Scott: I think it's more.

713
00:44:18,237 --> 00:44:23,850
Scott: the attitude I see more often is and my day I had just had a regular old watch to told the time and that was it.

714
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:29,664
Scott: That was enough, you know the same kind of Luddite attitude You see like a smartphone where it's like I just phone.

715
00:44:29,704 --> 00:44:30,367
Scott: it made phone calls.

716
00:44:30,387 --> 00:44:30,990
Scott: That's all I needed.

717
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:31,653
Scott: I don't need this.

718
00:44:31,673 --> 00:44:32,075
Scott: Well, you know what?

719
00:44:32,115 --> 00:44:32,738
Scott: It's alright fine.

720
00:44:32,778 --> 00:44:35,290
Scott: Well don't have that then and if you ask me for directions, fuck you.

721
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:35,974
Scott: It's like with good.

722
00:44:35,994 --> 00:44:37,143
Scott: See what happens asshole.

723
00:44:37,304 --> 00:44:38,029
Scott: Google glass.

724
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:39,269
Scott: You should be fucking grateful.

725
00:44:39,591 --> 00:44:45,610
Rym: Google glass had a great user experience and did really well at very specific tasks at making you look like a douchebag.

726
00:44:46,314 --> 00:44:47,461
Scott: Almost as bad as vaping.

727
00:44:47,622 --> 00:44:48,508
Rym: we both wore them.

728
00:44:48,709 --> 00:44:52,030
Scott: Yeah Like almost as bad as someone who vaped in a fedora.

729
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:55,370
Rym: It's funny when I find old panels because we wore those things for like a year and a half.

730
00:44:55,571 --> 00:44:57,423
Scott: Yeah, I would be utility at the same time.

731
00:44:57,443 --> 00:44:59,499
Scott: Yeah And then I wasn't.

732
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:05,305
Rym: Most of the complaints people had that weren't kind of ridiculous like nonsense.

733
00:45:05,325 --> 00:45:09,450
Rym: privacy concerns around Google glass Because that camera wasn't different mother cameras.

734
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:10,193
Rym: But I digress.

735
00:45:10,434 --> 00:45:17,100
Rym: the people complaining about the user experience were mostly complaining about Things that Google glass was never intended to do.

736
00:45:17,221 --> 00:45:17,421
Rym: like.

737
00:45:17,803 --> 00:45:19,830
Rym: I watched video on it and it drained the battery.

738
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:22,698
Rym: Like why the fuck are you watching a video on that tiny ass display?

739
00:45:22,919 --> 00:45:26,329
Rym: Yep, like watching a video on your watch equally stupid.

740
00:45:26,449 --> 00:45:32,309
Rym: Yep so Now we're in an era where fifth-generation like Android watches came out.

741
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:37,185
Rym: They're finally above the line where they're not just garbage and the iWatch has like.

742
00:45:37,466 --> 00:45:38,890
Rym: it is a good piece of technology.

743
00:45:39,011 --> 00:45:41,870
Scott: It is way better than every every Android watch.

744
00:45:42,171 --> 00:45:43,776
Rym: I think the fossil watch is fun.

745
00:45:43,796 --> 00:45:47,890
Rym: The current fifth-gen Android wear Android watches are really good.

746
00:45:48,155 --> 00:45:48,910
Rym: They're on that level.

747
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:58,690
Rym: the problem is most watches are running some proprietary non Android wear nonsense or They are running like some bastardized like old version of Android wear and they're underpowered.

748
00:45:58,851 --> 00:46:02,202
Rym: There's a lot of bad watches because I can't get the pebble.

749
00:46:02,242 --> 00:46:05,722
Scott: that just does exactly what I need and nothing else Which is still what I want.

750
00:46:05,924 --> 00:46:11,190
Scott: Yeah Because it died I went and got the Apple watch and I got the third-generation Apple watch.

751
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:15,630
Scott: They're already on fifth-generation, but I really don't see any difference meaningful between three and five.

752
00:46:16,212 --> 00:46:17,999
Scott: I actually got the LTE one, right?

753
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,630
Scott: So this is this is really like a key feature.

754
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:22,923
Scott: It cost me ten bucks a fucking month from Verizon.

755
00:46:23,205 --> 00:46:24,090
Rym: I thought about that.

756
00:46:24,351 --> 00:46:31,351
Rym: I cannot come up with a use case for an LTE enabled watch because I never do not have my phone with me ever I.

757
00:46:31,752 --> 00:46:34,459
Scott: but that's the thing is because now right?

758
00:46:34,759 --> 00:46:38,027
Scott: I don't have to have the phone with me, right?

759
00:46:38,047 --> 00:46:42,518
Scott: I Intentionally be like, oh I'm paying for this LTE.

760
00:46:42,578 --> 00:46:43,441
Scott: I don't need my phone.

761
00:46:43,481 --> 00:46:43,983
Scott: leave my phone.

762
00:46:44,444 --> 00:46:48,157
Scott: before I needed the phone I had to have it so I would bring it.

763
00:46:48,699 --> 00:46:53,495
Rym: but now LTE it's like oh, so here's my main Leave the phone behind.

764
00:46:53,656 --> 00:46:59,780
Rym: So alright if I just have my watch am I actually gonna type like Responses or talk to this thing?

765
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:01,330
Rym: to talk to people if they message me?

766
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:03,236
Rym: So why not just have my phone?

767
00:47:03,456 --> 00:47:07,890
Scott: so the app first of all the Apple watch has three different ways.

768
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:11,604
Scott: You can reply people easily and elegantly is the same thing.

769
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:12,266
Scott: I need to.

770
00:47:12,366 --> 00:47:13,350
Rym: the typing actually works.

771
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:15,058
Rym: The voice dictation is like perfect.

772
00:47:15,078 --> 00:47:15,762
Rym: It just works.

773
00:47:16,365 --> 00:47:17,490
Scott: I've done it occasionally.

774
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:18,756
Scott: Yeah, I even make you can.

775
00:47:19,138 --> 00:47:20,705
Scott: also my watch is a phone.

776
00:47:20,826 --> 00:47:21,710
Scott: It has its own phone number.

777
00:47:21,771 --> 00:47:24,810
Scott: I can make phone calls If you were to call my my phones.

778
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:28,104
Scott: You don't even need to know the number for the watch even though it does have its own number.

779
00:47:28,124 --> 00:47:31,241
Scott: if you just call my phone My watch will ring.

780
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:32,429
Scott: I can pick up and talk to you.

781
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:34,680
Scott: The one thing added a walkie-talkie feature.

782
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,690
Scott: if you also had a watch I could talk to you.

783
00:47:36,972 --> 00:47:38,141
Scott: These are like the crazy things.

784
00:47:38,342 --> 00:47:41,716
Scott: They're like, I don't need Ever use those features.

785
00:47:41,917 --> 00:47:43,743
Scott: I've you any all the things I've mentioned.

786
00:47:43,803 --> 00:47:45,570
Scott: I've used at least one time one time.

787
00:47:45,931 --> 00:47:48,881
Rym: When was the last time you did a walkie-talkie call from your watch?

788
00:47:48,961 --> 00:47:50,326
Scott: I've done a regular phone calls though.

789
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:57,641
Scott: Uh-huh Like, you know, I for example, I just leave my phone behind I go biking around I get a call I stop and I talk.

790
00:47:58,026 --> 00:47:58,329
Rym: All right.

791
00:47:58,671 --> 00:48:06,390
Rym: So one thing I've noticed with the eye watches in particular though My main use case for not having my phone because my phone is tiny.

792
00:48:06,511 --> 00:48:14,490
Rym: I always have my phone and my phone has things like full Google Maps If I like need to figure out directions or so my watch has full Apple Maps.

793
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:16,055
Rym: Yeah, my watch has full Google Maps.

794
00:48:16,095 --> 00:48:19,546
Rym: now to cash even but I want.

795
00:48:19,586 --> 00:48:28,108
Rym: the only real use case I have for a standalone watch without the phone Is that I'd like to be able to do runs and track Strava GPS without carrying my phone.

796
00:48:28,128 --> 00:48:29,502
Scott: Strava Does that exact?

797
00:48:29,563 --> 00:48:29,969
Scott: I can you know.

798
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:47,307
Rym: so I've looked at the even modern eye watches and people who have who bike and what the GPS line shows with Smartphone like even Android phone or Apple phone versus just watch even newest I watch the newest I watch is definitely less accurate than the phone.

799
00:48:47,448 --> 00:48:48,834
Scott: I'm accurate Do you need to be?

800
00:48:49,356 --> 00:48:54,762
Rym: uh, because I'm tracking my run times like over time I've looked at using this watch using other.

801
00:48:54,782 --> 00:48:56,270
Scott: why don't use the stopwatch feature?

802
00:48:57,331 --> 00:48:58,074
Rym: Because I'm doing it.

803
00:48:58,114 --> 00:48:59,179
Rym: I want to track my distance.

804
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:00,424
Rym: I'm running like a half marathon.

805
00:49:00,785 --> 00:49:07,670
Rym: I have found that the watch is Consistently significantly inflate how far you went because the trackings worse and it gets a lot of jitter.

806
00:49:07,771 --> 00:49:11,610
Scott: Well, I've noticed that yes the watch gets jitter, but my phone also gets jitter.

807
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:14,780
Rym: I don't does not my phone compared to the watch?

808
00:49:15,222 --> 00:49:17,248
Rym: massive difference, you know, it's really perfect.

809
00:49:17,348 --> 00:49:17,730
Scott: at GPS.

810
00:49:18,051 --> 00:49:21,630
Scott: My standalone fancy bike computer basically draws a perfectly straight line.

811
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:24,620
Rym: Yeah, so fitness device is the way to go with that.

812
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:27,409
Scott: but any of the point is is that it's like.

813
00:49:27,449 --> 00:49:30,365
Scott: yes The watch can do Strava all on its own.

814
00:49:30,466 --> 00:49:31,029
Scott: with LTE.

815
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:37,750
Scott: It can upload all on its own doesn't need anything else, but that will kill the battery on any watch.

816
00:49:38,339 --> 00:49:38,869
Scott: Right your basis?

817
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:39,896
Scott: That's the thing that I want.

818
00:49:39,936 --> 00:49:46,430
Scott: to go back to the pebble because the pebble battery lasts several days But the pebble battery watch the Apple watch battery lasts like a day and a half.

819
00:49:46,691 --> 00:49:55,130
Rym: If you do Strava not a day pebble battery only lasted several days because it it's GPS It wasn't doing any of this stuff was passed through to the phone.

820
00:49:55,278 --> 00:50:07,447
Rym: Yeah I still think the right move for the future of this technology is the phone has a big battery and a lot of horsepower And the watch is a semi powerful standalone device coupled with a link to that thing.

821
00:50:07,467 --> 00:50:08,470
Rym: Yeah, you're carrying both.

822
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:14,930
Scott: Well, I mean that's the thing I don't understand is like there are times where if I push the Strava button on my watch, right?

823
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:15,713
Scott: It'll.

824
00:50:16,115 --> 00:50:19,550
Scott: even if my phone is nearby it will still do it on its own.

825
00:50:19,651 --> 00:50:21,061
Scott: I have to if I want my phone to do it.

826
00:50:21,081 --> 00:50:22,290
Scott: I have to push start on the phone.

827
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:25,181
Scott: It's like the watch should be like hey is the phone nearby?

828
00:50:25,482 --> 00:50:26,686
Scott: No, I guess I'm on my own.

829
00:50:26,766 --> 00:50:27,730
Scott: or hey is the phone nearby?

830
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:29,187
Scott: Okay phone you take care of it.

831
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:29,992
Rym: So get this.

832
00:50:30,032 --> 00:50:34,525
Rym: that's one big difference what my what this Android watch does is it just uses both.

833
00:50:34,987 --> 00:50:41,966
Rym: it just whichever one's more accurate at the time Mmm, like automatically if I have my phone in my pocket and I use the watch to trigger it.

834
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:42,970
Rym: It's just perfect.

835
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:43,572
Rym: No jitter.

836
00:50:43,913 --> 00:50:46,581
Rym: if I don't have my phone it does the shitty jitter.

837
00:50:46,701 --> 00:50:47,103
Scott: Well, it's it.

838
00:50:47,123 --> 00:50:49,430
Scott: there's no reason that the Apple watch can't do that.

839
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:49,952
Scott: It's just this.

840
00:50:49,992 --> 00:50:54,289
Scott: people who made the Strava Apple watch app didn't program it that way, right?

841
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:56,017
Scott: But yeah, it's.

842
00:50:56,098 --> 00:50:57,409
Scott: you know, there's other stuff going on.

843
00:50:57,570 --> 00:50:58,032
Scott: So what else?

844
00:50:58,072 --> 00:51:06,338
Rym: basically the difference between the pebble like minimalist watch and a current like because I have a modern fifth generation Android smartwatch which has all these extra features.

845
00:51:06,699 --> 00:51:12,850
Rym: The only other feature I use is the real-time directions Because they are fantastic.

846
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:14,949
Scott: I don't use the directions too often, but they're on there.

847
00:51:15,312 --> 00:51:17,730
Rym: I especially walking directions because I tend to be like in London.

848
00:51:18,072 --> 00:51:24,010
Scott: Usually I'll just put the directions in on my phone But then like as I'm walking the watch will announce the direction.

849
00:51:24,313 --> 00:51:31,590
Rym: Ah, I mine does that by default But I can also hit a button and then it'll just show the streaming directions with the arrows and the top-down map on the watch.

850
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:33,295
Scott: All right, so other features on my watch.

851
00:51:33,336 --> 00:51:34,820
Scott: I actually use right.

852
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:40,483
Scott: the number one thing actually that I use on there is QR codes to get into things.

853
00:51:40,705 --> 00:51:44,583
Scott: Yep, right At the movie theater beep at the.

854
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:45,869
Scott: even at the airport beep.

855
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:49,008
Scott: So I can go to Madison Square Garden to show my wrist beep.

856
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:54,390
Rym: So Scott, two of the airports I've flown in recently specifically will not let you use your watch.

857
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:55,440
Rym: You have to use a phone.

858
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:56,410
Scott: I haven't had that problem.

859
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:59,121
Rym: Yeah, they won't let you use the watch or the watch though.

860
00:51:59,201 --> 00:52:00,386
Rym: No watch screen will scan.

861
00:52:00,687 --> 00:52:03,748
Rym: specifically I watch screens will never scan at these airports anyway.

862
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:13,430
Rym: Spotify I can control my music just by looking at the watch One the big one I use actually is I bound because that my watch has two hardware buttons.

863
00:52:13,932 --> 00:52:16,160
Rym: I bound it to the Google Authenticator app.

864
00:52:16,682 --> 00:52:18,850
Rym: Mmm, so I can hit a button and I see all my codes.

865
00:52:19,791 --> 00:52:21,157
Rym: That is killer.

866
00:52:21,178 --> 00:52:26,080
Scott: instead of taking my phone out or getting my yubi key I can pay for stuff with the watch with Apple pay.

867
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:26,743
Scott: That's pretty good.

868
00:52:27,004 --> 00:52:28,189
Rym: I can do that with Android pay.

869
00:52:28,209 --> 00:52:30,459
Rym: now I like that but I never use that.

870
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:32,950
Rym: I use it because I just use my credit card everywhere.

871
00:52:33,231 --> 00:52:33,754
Scott: No, I use.

872
00:52:33,935 --> 00:52:36,670
Rym: I use Apple pay a lot which a lot of places I go don't take Apple pay.

873
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:40,101
Scott: I mean most restaurants I go to don't take it.

874
00:52:40,261 --> 00:52:41,666
Scott: tons of places I go now use.

875
00:52:41,727 --> 00:52:42,670
Scott: I use it a constantly.

876
00:52:42,891 --> 00:52:44,215
Rym: Yeah, most restaurants.

877
00:52:44,476 --> 00:52:45,700
Rym: I've been to do not take it.

878
00:52:45,921 --> 00:52:48,690
Scott: Well, I mean no only restaurants or they bring a thing to you.

879
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:51,479
Rym: Yeah, so as a result, I have to have my kind of like.

880
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:58,101
Rym: my watch does not let me go without my credit card So I still have to bring my wallet until I buy the Apple pay.

881
00:52:58,121 --> 00:53:03,560
Rym: or the Android pay would mean I can do Everything I would do I mean without my wallet.

882
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:04,263
Rym: It's worthless.

883
00:53:04,403 --> 00:53:07,697
Scott: even so it's like yeah I have my rely on it.

884
00:53:07,797 --> 00:53:10,670
Scott: No, but even though I have my wallet with me, right?

885
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:14,327
Scott: It's faster to just pay with the Apple pay.

886
00:53:14,408 --> 00:53:17,260
Scott: It's true I just use it if I can which is a lot.

887
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,856
Rym: but I found that most places I pay for something Do not take it.

888
00:53:21,419 --> 00:53:22,566
Scott: most places I pay for something.

889
00:53:22,626 --> 00:53:26,160
Rym: most markets I go to my you take as I go to lunch restaurants.

890
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:30,015
Rym: I go to lunch almost every day every drug store No lunch place.

891
00:53:30,055 --> 00:53:31,341
Rym: I got to take every lunch place.

892
00:53:31,422 --> 00:53:34,395
Rym: I go to take like literally none of them Except like the Pret.

893
00:53:34,736 --> 00:53:37,688
Scott: I don't know where you're going but the places I go almost every place takes it.

894
00:53:37,748 --> 00:53:41,397
Scott: now Grocery store takes it every place.

895
00:53:41,879 --> 00:53:43,264
Rym: I don't think our grocery store takes it.

896
00:53:43,364 --> 00:53:47,590
Scott: our girls several grocery stores Take it and all the ones I go to yeah, my haircut place.

897
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:49,818
Scott: I think maybe you're not realizing that places take it.

898
00:53:49,858 --> 00:53:50,340
Scott: when they do.

899
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:56,189
Scott: I think people are like surprised because there's some places that Are like Apple pay here and announcing it.

900
00:53:56,491 --> 00:54:00,750
Scott: There's a lot of places where they're just like a little wireless symbol and you're like, is it gonna work?

901
00:54:00,991 --> 00:54:02,300
Scott: I don't know.

902
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,648
Scott: And so you don't try it.

903
00:54:04,292 --> 00:54:05,959
Scott: Now you don't see the logos.

904
00:54:05,999 --> 00:54:06,541
Scott: you're not sure.

905
00:54:06,622 --> 00:54:07,023
Scott: but guess what?

906
00:54:07,083 --> 00:54:08,570
Scott: Oh, it fucking works if you try to use it.

907
00:54:08,691 --> 00:54:11,409
Rym: It's funny because most of the places when I ask they specifically don't take it.

908
00:54:11,631 --> 00:54:15,485
Scott: But the places that tend a lot of places don't think they take it cuz they don't know either.

909
00:54:15,506 --> 00:54:21,530
Rym: the places that tend to take It and it just works are the places that have like a square device that they're using as their payments.

910
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:24,962
Scott: It works and it's like places that don't even realize they take it.

911
00:54:25,123 --> 00:54:28,519
Rym: actually take you know where it doesn't fucking work Overseas like anywhere.

912
00:54:28,539 --> 00:54:28,982
Scott: Oh, no.

913
00:54:29,002 --> 00:54:29,626
Scott: Yeah, that's not good.

914
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:33,196
Rym: Yeah, but that Like once you get out of the u.s.

915
00:54:33,216 --> 00:54:35,968
Rym: Like good fucking luck doing that kind of thing in a lot of places.

916
00:54:36,249 --> 00:54:39,034
Scott: Yep Yeah, I got.

917
00:54:39,235 --> 00:54:41,626
Scott: I got an app for timers when I'm cooking.

918
00:54:42,048 --> 00:54:46,400
Scott: yeah So I'm gonna take my phone out and get it risk getting messed up cooking.

919
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,602
Rym: Yep, uh seeing the cool like the upcoming weather That's something I stick in there.

920
00:54:50,803 --> 00:54:51,751
Scott: Yeah, I mean, that's the thing You know.

921
00:54:51,771 --> 00:54:54,845
Scott: a lot of people get those old watches with like weather and stuff.

922
00:54:54,865 --> 00:55:01,650
Scott: It's like no no I get real actual live weather like, you know exact what temperature is it here?

923
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:03,294
Scott: What temperature is it gonna be?

924
00:55:03,374 --> 00:55:06,083
Scott: every everything and I get the sun exactly.

925
00:55:06,243 --> 00:55:11,333
Rym: the only only other features I use they're only two and 99%.

926
00:55:11,333 --> 00:55:16,533
Rym: what a smartwatch could do kind of like a smartphone not actually useful is Google Keep.

927
00:55:16,553 --> 00:55:17,417
Rym: so I can take a quick note.

928
00:55:17,457 --> 00:55:22,922
Rym: when someone says the name of some movie at a party Yeah, I'm gonna forget to watch that movie the next day.

929
00:55:22,942 --> 00:55:27,509
Rym: or I have an idea for a show I just really quick like stick it into Google Keep on the watch.

930
00:55:28,052 --> 00:55:31,310
Rym: That's actually been really helpful to remember to talk about stuff on GeekNights.

931
00:55:31,571 --> 00:55:32,333
Scott: Yeah, that's good.

932
00:55:32,514 --> 00:55:36,126
Rym: And number two is the button to find my phone if I don't know where my phone is.

933
00:55:36,547 --> 00:55:38,120
Scott: Mm-hmm That's it.

934
00:55:38,323 --> 00:55:50,070
Rym: That's good, too Yeah But I find that a lot of people treat their smartphone and their smartwatch in the same kind of wrong way Where they always ask the question of what cool apps can I get on the device?

935
00:55:51,173 --> 00:55:51,755
Scott: Just a problem.

936
00:55:51,795 --> 00:55:56,670
Rym: in general when they should be asking what do I want this thing to do then can it do this thing?

937
00:55:56,850 --> 00:55:58,537
Rym: I wanted which app does that thing?

938
00:55:58,557 --> 00:56:01,008
Scott: Yeah, if you can't think of the thing to do, right?

939
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:11,309
Scott: It's like whenever I get a new computer I don't install any software besides the OS and the web browser and then what I do is I Use my computer and I say and it's like alright, I want to play a game now.

940
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:14,140
Scott: Well now I will install steam then right?

941
00:56:14,281 --> 00:56:14,421
Scott: Yep.

942
00:56:14,461 --> 00:56:18,857
Scott: It's like until I actually want to do a thing I don't get an app to do a thing.

943
00:56:19,098 --> 00:56:24,134
Scott: people go out and they like install a fuck ton of apps and it's like Using those apps.

944
00:56:24,235 --> 00:56:33,890
Rym: well thus here do not get a smartwatch if you don't know why you want a smartwatch like you Articulate what you want other than it's a smartwatch like specifically like for us.

945
00:56:34,372 --> 00:56:40,953
Rym: I wanted to show me notifications and do like four other things and I was willing to pay money For those things.

946
00:56:40,993 --> 00:56:42,698
Rym: if you don't have a thing you need it for.

947
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:46,329
Rym: just use a regular watch and your phone or just your phone.

948
00:56:48,731 --> 00:56:51,794
Rym: Fitness tractors, I guess are a very special-purpose thing But I don't.

949
00:56:51,874 --> 00:56:55,070
Rym: I think that like I said, that's kind of out of bounds for what we're talking about today.

950
00:56:55,351 --> 00:56:55,532
Rym: Mm-hmm.

951
00:56:55,933 --> 00:56:59,710
Rym: I do wish there was a mod like a new equivalent of Google Glass.

952
00:57:00,071 --> 00:57:02,741
Rym: I'd like to still have that screen and I'd like to have.

953
00:57:03,042 --> 00:57:09,090
Rym: the one thing I'd like to be able to do is just really quick Take a picture without getting my phone out and I don't want a camera on my watch.

954
00:57:09,191 --> 00:57:10,709
Rym: I feel like that's gonna be a pain in the ass.

955
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:16,769
Scott: I can remotely control fire a camera from my watch I can set my phone up somewhere and then be like pew.

956
00:57:17,131 --> 00:57:23,837
Rym: I would like to have a like a Google Glass too with a better design because I would use the Just take a picture by wing.

957
00:57:24,158 --> 00:57:25,646
Scott: It needs to just look like glasses.

958
00:57:25,686 --> 00:57:26,289
Scott: So no one knows.

959
00:57:26,691 --> 00:57:33,669
Rym: Yeah, mostly because stupid people got mad about it Even though getting out your phone and doing the exact same thing did not bother them.

960
00:57:33,931 --> 00:57:37,030
Scott: Nope, or the fact that there are security cameras everywhere did not bother.

961
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:40,802
Rym: Yeah, also the fact that they're not mad about that Instagram glasses.

962
00:57:40,822 --> 00:57:42,246
Rym: They're only mad about Google Glass.

963
00:57:42,567 --> 00:57:43,430
Scott: Yeah, I don't know people.

964
00:57:43,791 --> 00:57:47,223
Rym: Yeah, but smartwatch, you know design.

965
00:57:47,364 --> 00:57:48,588
Scott: design makes all the difference.

966
00:57:48,849 --> 00:57:51,478
Rym: also though My smartwatch has a feature that is ridiculous.

967
00:57:52,361 --> 00:57:53,987
Rym: It has a full-on speaker in it.

968
00:57:54,208 --> 00:57:54,850
Scott: Yeah, so does mine.

969
00:57:55,011 --> 00:57:57,290
Rym: Yeah, it can just make noise like lots of noise.

970
00:57:57,370 --> 00:58:00,085
Rym: It's really loud and I turn the shit off.

971
00:58:00,105 --> 00:58:01,130
Scott: I can play music on mine.

972
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:05,652
Scott: I can stream music directly to the watch from the internet and play it I can.

973
00:58:05,793 --> 00:58:15,670
Rym: I can load like music into this thing and even without the LTE And it'll just cash it and play music for me either out of the speaker or directly via Bluetooth to my Bluetooth headphones.

974
00:58:15,772 --> 00:58:25,116
Rym: Yep, you can do that And I don't really need that feature because I always have my watch with me and I don't ever listen to music when I'm biking Or running because that's kind of dangerous.

975
00:58:25,217 --> 00:58:29,410
Rym: and also I don't need to fill every gap in my life with background noise.

976
00:58:29,831 --> 00:58:31,779
Scott: No, but it is an option.

977
00:58:31,919 --> 00:58:32,300
Rym: It's there.

978
00:58:32,541 --> 00:58:34,790
Rym: That's a perfectly valid use case for a smartwatch.

979
00:58:35,872 --> 00:58:40,830
Scott: Well, yeah, it's like basically every you know feature from the phone that could be minified has been minified.

980
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:44,005
Rym: Yep, do you need another screen that's easier to see quickly?

981
00:58:44,065 --> 00:58:45,110
Rym: then get a smartwatch?
