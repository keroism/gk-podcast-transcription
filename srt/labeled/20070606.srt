1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,727
Scott: It's Wednesday June 6th.

2
00:00:11,229 --> 00:00:11,811
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,072 --> 00:00:14,440
Scott: I'm Rym and this is the GeekNights.

4
00:00:15,163 --> 00:00:21,059
Scott: Tonight we reviewed the amazing awesome comic just released a trade paperback Elks run.

5
00:00:27,521 --> 00:00:40,130
Rym: You know if it weren't for the fact that the one thing I need from Linux isn't on Windows I think I would have given up on Linux pretty much right now at least for my primary computer because Audio just doesn't work for shit in Linux.

6
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:45,510
Rym: I gotta say I gotta say I got to admit well I mean, it's not that audio doesn't work in Linux.

7
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,517
Scott: It audio is shitty in Linux.

8
00:00:47,557 --> 00:00:48,300
Scott: There is no doubt.

9
00:00:48,802 --> 00:00:54,280
Scott: It's just that Linux works pretty much perfectly well for absolutely normal everyday computer.

10
00:00:54,441 --> 00:00:56,247
Rym: Apparently it's not normal to record.

11
00:00:56,267 --> 00:01:03,125
Scott: Yeah, and it works perfectly normal on Nor you know run-of-the-mill Older hardware.

12
00:01:03,185 --> 00:01:06,400
Scott: when you have a new fancy computer, it's not gonna work for shit.

13
00:01:06,681 --> 00:01:07,645
Rym: It's not that new.

14
00:01:07,745 --> 00:01:09,011
Scott: I'm not a great deal of effort.

15
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,577
Rym: It's not really that new and fancy.

16
00:01:10,617 --> 00:01:13,609
Rym: this chip sets Relatively old and see but it's.

17
00:01:13,911 --> 00:01:16,340
Scott: it's relatively new and fancy compared to Linux.

18
00:01:16,461 --> 00:01:19,538
Scott: I'm talking like you know two-year-old stuff here.

19
00:01:19,699 --> 00:01:22,520
Scott: well I think that's some 64 bits or two cores.

20
00:01:22,701 --> 00:01:32,819
Rym: Or I think the problem is more that most people use Linux don't do anything like podcasting So no one really cares about if the audio actually works for anything intense.

21
00:01:32,839 --> 00:01:33,241
Rym: well See that's.

22
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:36,393
Scott: the thing is that there are a lot of podcasters on Linux.

23
00:01:36,775 --> 00:01:37,859
Rym: Oh, there's like three.

24
00:01:38,381 --> 00:01:42,695
Scott: There's actually a whole like at least 20 or 30 I can name like five.

25
00:01:42,755 --> 00:01:45,958
Scott: I think all right But it's you know it.

26
00:01:46,702 --> 00:01:56,880
Scott: It's mostly the fact that if you want Linux to be easy you pretty much Ubuntu feisty is the way to go And that's also the best way to get the newest hardware working with the least effort.

27
00:01:57,523 --> 00:02:05,900
Scott: But also because the way Ubuntu works You're not gonna be able to upgrade the kernel like there's a better kernel that might work really well on your computer.

28
00:02:05,981 --> 00:02:08,519
Scott: But you can't get that in feisty great really easily.

29
00:02:09,264 --> 00:02:12,019
Scott: You know gentoo you could but that's a huge pain in the ass.

30
00:02:12,622 --> 00:02:16,275
Scott: So it all comes down to like your distributions and all this stuff.

31
00:02:16,355 --> 00:02:26,839
Scott: and right now There does not exist a Linux distribution that without a great deal of effort It doesn't have problems doing exactly what we want to do.

32
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:33,864
Scott: Yeah It's always the special cases that it totally fucks on and all the general cases Linux has it covered.

33
00:02:34,145 --> 00:02:43,235
Scott: when it comes down to a special case like I want to do this specific thing that is slightly out of Line of the norm you're gonna run into at least one bump in the road.

34
00:02:43,737 --> 00:02:44,560
Scott: It's guaranteed.

35
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,093
Rym: Yeah, like I want to play games on my computer.

36
00:02:47,193 --> 00:02:47,655
Rym: Oh Linux.

37
00:02:47,675 --> 00:02:48,520
Rym: Can't do that?

38
00:02:50,481 --> 00:02:53,520
Scott: No again, it's because the games haven't been written for Linux.

39
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:55,724
Scott: Just fine.

40
00:02:55,985 --> 00:02:56,528
Rym: Oh great.

41
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:59,220
Rym: Yeah doom 3 was such a wonderful game.

42
00:02:59,421 --> 00:03:02,830
Scott: At least the audio is actually a complaint like there's something wrong with Linux.

43
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:07,043
Scott: the games complaint is not really anything wrong with Linux It's in fact.

44
00:03:07,143 --> 00:03:09,772
Scott: I say it's a miracle that you can wine so many games.

45
00:03:10,314 --> 00:03:11,478
Rym: Yeah, but there's more games.

46
00:03:11,498 --> 00:03:13,424
Scott: You can't wine That is true.

47
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:13,866
Scott: Honestly.

48
00:03:13,886 --> 00:03:16,635
Rym: I would just boot into Windows, but ReSound doesn't work.

49
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:19,725
Rym: ReSound barely works in Linux So it certainly doesn't work in Windows.

50
00:03:20,428 --> 00:03:20,970
Scott: Yeah.

51
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:21,973
Scott: Yeah, it just.

52
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:31,060
Scott: I think more of our problem Also is that there just don't exist that many quality single-track wave editing programs.

53
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,628
Scott: They just aren't any of them that they did.

54
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:34,391
Scott: where are they?

55
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:41,674
Scott: this ReSound which has a bunch of problems there was cool It was cool at it, and I guess audition, and that's what else is there?

56
00:03:41,734 --> 00:03:42,757
Scott: is that Sony thing?

57
00:03:42,798 --> 00:03:43,279
Scott: fuck that?

58
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:52,142
Scott: What there's a whole frickin type of application and there are so few choices and no one's working on this Problem.

59
00:03:52,744 --> 00:03:54,810
Rym: because no one cares except me and I have time.

60
00:03:54,871 --> 00:03:55,894
Scott: I know like imagine.

61
00:03:55,954 --> 00:03:57,900
Scott: It was like only one spreadsheet.

62
00:03:59,022 --> 00:04:02,819
Rym: You know what there effectively is because most people don't know about open office And they don't care.

63
00:04:03,061 --> 00:04:05,660
Scott: But I'm saying is like there are a whole bunch of spreadsheets, and they all work.

64
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,431
Scott: And if you need one you can get one.

65
00:04:07,592 --> 00:04:08,860
Scott: yeah, and it's not a problem.

66
00:04:09,781 --> 00:04:11,488
Scott: We need a specific application.

67
00:04:11,508 --> 00:04:14,399
Rym: It doesn't exist because not many people do what we do.

68
00:04:14,841 --> 00:04:17,173
Scott: I think it's a lot of people do would do that.

69
00:04:17,192 --> 00:04:18,259
Scott: It's just they don't know any better.

70
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,774
Rym: well I mean they'd like I said they don't do what we do.

71
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:21,680
Rym: they do things differently.

72
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,502
Rym: They do things.

73
00:04:22,522 --> 00:04:25,331
Rym: they use that garage band or all those other programs.

74
00:04:25,371 --> 00:04:32,088
Rym: the way the multi-track editors work like audacity is a pretty Good multi-track editor But it's actually really crap.

75
00:04:32,128 --> 00:04:35,397
Rym: if you want to edit or actually filter audio all the filters are garbage.

76
00:04:35,437 --> 00:04:36,500
Rym: the compressor is garbage.

77
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:38,267
Rym: Lots of support barely works.

78
00:04:38,347 --> 00:04:43,065
Rym: most of the lots of plugins are crap, but that's it's Wednesday So we're going to talk about this anymore.

79
00:04:43,105 --> 00:04:47,459
Rym: I'm just miffed that my new computer is awesome except for podcasting.

80
00:04:48,223 --> 00:04:49,831
Scott: Yep, yep, yep, yep.

81
00:04:50,274 --> 00:04:50,595
Scott: Oh, well.

82
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:51,279
Scott: What's she gonna do?

83
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:58,460
Scott: So I got some news, but the site that has the news article currently has an internal server error.

84
00:04:59,023 --> 00:05:01,299
Scott: But that doesn't matter because I remember the news enough.

85
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:12,383
Scott: Basically, it's bad news really bad news Like possibly some of the worst news if you've ever seen I don't know Macross.

86
00:05:12,844 --> 00:05:17,816
Scott: you know the original one the amazing amazing TV show that is the amazing of all amazingness.

87
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:22,160
Scott: or if you've seen I don't know a whole bunch of other anime.

88
00:05:22,903 --> 00:05:26,400
Scott: I can't really remember the names of it all because I probably haven't watched any of them.

89
00:05:26,942 --> 00:05:29,110
Scott: But it doesn't matter you watch.

90
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,580
Scott: Macross has this amazing soundtrack.

91
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,417
Scott: It's like fully composed with an orchestra and the whole deal, and it's.

92
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:40,760
Scott: it's really Sort of weird, but it fits so well, and it's so wonderful in every way.

93
00:05:41,402 --> 00:05:50,020
Scott: And it was composed by a man named Kentaro Haneda and Kentaro Haneda I regret has recently passed away.

94
00:05:50,622 --> 00:05:58,013
Rym: Now if I had it available, which I don't just because I haven't migrated all of my data yet I would probably have played the Macross national anthem just now.

95
00:05:58,073 --> 00:06:03,875
Scott: I've got every Macross mp3 There is on my computer over there, so if we want we can go get it.

96
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:07,009
Rym: no now with all the problems I'm having with audio right now in Linux.

97
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,492
Rym: Yeah,

98
00:06:07,512 --> 00:06:24,008
Scott: yeah, but regardless This is kind of sad because he was this amazing composer, and if you've never watched Macross you should at least like Watch some episodes and just listen to the music in that show even if you don't like the show because it's not a show for Everyone even though it's a show for everyone.

99
00:06:24,028 --> 00:06:25,172
Scott: What's wrong with you not liking it.

100
00:06:26,015 --> 00:06:26,457
Rym: I'll admit.

101
00:06:26,477 --> 00:06:28,906
Rym: I it's okay I don't I don't like it that much.

102
00:06:29,007 --> 00:06:31,075
Rym: you suck, and I've watched almost all of it.

103
00:06:31,155 --> 00:06:35,271
Scott: you suck, but The music in it is really something to behold.

104
00:06:35,472 --> 00:06:37,480
Scott: and they're gonna have a big concert.

105
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:43,035
Scott: They were planning this already having a big concert for you know the I guess 25th anniversary of Macross.

106
00:06:43,095 --> 00:06:49,280
Scott: I think I'm not sure but When they had they're gonna of course now dedicate that concert to this guy.

107
00:06:49,501 --> 00:06:53,220
Scott: So I'm definitely gonna like be looking for a DVD of that or so let's go to the concert.

108
00:06:53,702 --> 00:06:54,667
Scott: I think it's a little far away.

109
00:06:54,827 --> 00:06:55,330
Rym: Where is it?

110
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,636
Scott: Japan on the side of the world?

111
00:06:56,656 --> 00:06:57,299
Rym: Let's head over there.

112
00:06:57,902 --> 00:06:58,866
Rym: That's all you know biggie.

113
00:06:59,268 --> 00:07:00,051
Scott: Yeah, right.

114
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:04,130
Rym: so in news more close to home Con season is upon us.

115
00:07:04,331 --> 00:07:05,620
Rym: This is more of a personal news.

116
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,469
Rym: It's not a news that's out there on the internet anywhere.

117
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,535
Rym: It's just my observation.

118
00:07:08,575 --> 00:07:09,480
Scott: We're making news.

119
00:07:09,822 --> 00:07:10,285
Scott: Oh my god.

120
00:07:10,325 --> 00:07:10,868
Scott: Is that the wow?

121
00:07:10,908 --> 00:07:12,840
Scott: is that the next step for you guys to make news?

122
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,720
Scott: We're gonna be journalists read news from a website.

123
00:07:16,362 --> 00:07:19,254
Rym: Well, it's kind of annoying news, and I haven't really.

124
00:07:19,274 --> 00:07:30,207
Rym: I have one or two Last-ditch leads I could use to figure out what's going on But I got to say that I'm getting the impression that Otakon is really not That together.

125
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:33,865
Rym: this year compared to any other year of Otakon It's really.

126
00:07:33,926 --> 00:07:36,980
Scott: it's more upsetting because I'm looking at what other cons are doing.

127
00:07:37,362 --> 00:07:40,376
Scott: Look at the go to anime Expos website and look at the news.

128
00:07:40,396 --> 00:07:42,906
Scott: remember we talked about anime So was last week or two weeks ago.

129
00:07:42,926 --> 00:07:43,207
Scott: Yep.

130
00:07:43,628 --> 00:07:46,840
Scott: They're doing some crazy amazing shit over there.

131
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,224
Scott: Like I usually like.

132
00:07:48,264 --> 00:07:49,669
Scott: I never been to anime expo.

133
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:57,580
Scott: so but I had suspicions about it for a long time that it was a very Industry centric con and I got the feeling that it wasn't my kind of deal.

134
00:07:58,183 --> 00:08:05,731
Scott: But based on the news and the press releases they have put out this year It's looking really hot just in terms of what they're having there.

135
00:08:05,992 --> 00:08:07,596
Scott: You know regardless of anything else.

136
00:08:07,677 --> 00:08:23,153
Scott: I may be suspicious about Meanwhile Otakon is what a month or two away, and they haven't announced a musical guest or anything and They just recently had like the panels and the artist alley submissions.

137
00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:25,840
Scott: They haven't gotten back to anybody about it.

138
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:33,380
Rym: I don't know if they've gotten back to anyone or not for the artist alley But they definitely did not respond in any way to my request for a table at all.

139
00:08:33,942 --> 00:08:39,746
Scott: I mean usually cons get all this stuff out of the way Way before the con.

140
00:08:39,807 --> 00:08:43,720
Scott: like you'll get your artist alley table like six months in advance.

141
00:08:44,481 --> 00:08:45,506
Scott: You'll get your pet.

142
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:48,480
Scott: You'll know know it if you're doing a panel or not way in advance.

143
00:08:49,101 --> 00:08:56,340
Scott: I mean, how are people who are like preparing fancy panels supposed to know like prepare the panel in such a short period of time?

144
00:08:56,561 --> 00:08:59,300
Rym: I'll put it in very specific because it's not just my perception.

145
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:03,031
Rym: I'll tell you exactly about my interactions with all the conventions.

146
00:09:03,071 --> 00:09:09,952
Rym: We've been working with this year and for next year all right and basically Long time ago, and I started talking to Kinetic con.

147
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,539
Rym: We've already hammered the whole thing out.

148
00:09:12,021 --> 00:09:14,080
Rym: Kinetic con is already set and we're done.

149
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:16,449
Rym: We've already got all of our programming ready.

150
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:20,949
Rym: all that's left to do is to specifically schedule When they'll all be.

151
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,198
Rym: but I already have a vague idea.

152
00:09:22,218 --> 00:09:25,430
Scott: yep So Kinetic con is like a couple weeks before Otakon.

153
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,260
Scott: you got this hammered out when oh god over a month ago.

154
00:09:28,461 --> 00:09:29,084
Scott: It's over a month ago.

155
00:09:29,144 --> 00:09:39,479
Rym: in fact they responded to me within 12 hours Every single time I've emailed them and in fact they out of the blue send me status updates on what's going on.

156
00:09:40,021 --> 00:09:42,490
Scott: All right, and didn't we just hear something from katsu-kun?

157
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,179
Rym: Oh all right, so katsu-kun next year?

158
00:09:45,942 --> 00:09:46,423
Rym: Well one.

159
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:53,544
Rym: we're subscribed to the state like the video game katsu staff email list because we're kind of staff for them And it was really fun.

160
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,150
Scott: We're half members of game katsu.

161
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,297
Rym: Yeah, and those guys are all awesome.

162
00:09:57,557 --> 00:09:59,765
Rym: Yeah, but Basically unlike.

163
00:09:59,805 --> 00:10:12,588
Rym: I don't know how other conventions work, but I do know that watching that mailing list They started planning next katsu-kun pretty much two weeks after katsu-kun ended And they've been continuously talking about it.

164
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:13,792
Rym: and now well.

165
00:10:13,832 --> 00:10:16,400
Rym: They're already putting together the programming for katsu-kun.

166
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:23,377
Rym: We're already working with them to get the programming done for katsu-kun Which is months and months and months away a long time from now.

167
00:10:23,438 --> 00:10:23,860
Scott: meanwhile?

168
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,377
Scott: Otakon Perhaps our favorite card.

169
00:10:27,438 --> 00:10:27,660
Rym: I'm gonna.

170
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:33,180
Rym: I'm not gonna name any names because I don't know how many of you work with these people, but I've emailed Otakon.

171
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:38,456
Rym: I've sent dozens of emails to Otakon and various people in the past several years.

172
00:10:38,476 --> 00:10:38,696
Rym: Maybe

173
00:10:38,716 --> 00:10:39,920
Scott: that's oh in the several years

174
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:40,864
Rym: Yeah, but that's why

175
00:10:40,884 --> 00:10:42,953
Scott: they're not replying because you're emailing them to death,

176
00:10:43,114 --> 00:10:54,416
Rym: but this year I Anyone I've ever emailed within Otakon has not responded to me at all or if they did They responded with basically nothing or they said in fact at one point.

177
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:56,946
Rym: I got an email saying oh well We'll get back with you shortly.

178
00:10:56,966 --> 00:11:00,079
Rym: We're almost done with whatever and then they just never follow up.

179
00:11:00,622 --> 00:11:08,545
Scott: It's like okay your con is the biggest and the baddest on the East Coast But if you don't get on the ball I think it's already on its way.

180
00:11:08,605 --> 00:11:10,470
Scott: it feels like it's.

181
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,513
Scott: it's on the way down.

182
00:11:11,573 --> 00:11:16,620
Scott: now like I honestly all the other cons have bigger Badder events and they're on the ball and Otakon.

183
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,809
Rym: I mean I hate to say it, but we're getting to the point where if they don't respond soon Even if they want us to do panels.

184
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,556
Rym: We're not gonna prepare anything.

185
00:11:23,576 --> 00:11:24,360
Rym: We're not we can't.

186
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,997
Rym: We've got too much else to do with other cons.

187
00:11:26,038 --> 00:11:39,170
Scott: now I know it's it's it's I might like and if they drop the ball too hard this year I could see in the future like it could be the doom of Otakon in a few years or Could be at least with me what might not even go.

188
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:45,640
Rym: yeah meanwhile the New York anime festival Which a lot of people have maligned a little bit about being very corporate yeah

189
00:11:46,282 --> 00:11:53,929
Scott: Very skeptical about the New York anime festival to say because it was run by the same people's New York comic-con And it's gonna be for-profit It's gonna be the Javits Center.

190
00:11:53,949 --> 00:12:03,780
Scott: and those three things when added to Anime convention send off all the alarm bells and the brain of Scott saying warning warning major catastrophe coming to you soon.

191
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,700
Rym: Well, we can't talk about it yet.

192
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,979
Rym: Well, I don't know if we can but I don't want to reveal anything.

193
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:11,200
Scott: well Let me go see what they have said on their website.

194
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,386
Rym: Yes suffice to say they.

195
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:20,959
Rym: it seems like they've got their act together Really well and a lot better than anyone would have expected and I actually have high hopes for this convention now.

196
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:23,989
Rym: plus When I talk talk to them about panels.

197
00:12:24,451 --> 00:12:26,076
Rym: we already the contracts done.

198
00:12:26,117 --> 00:12:30,290
Rym: We're doing panels there It's already all set up and this thing is until December.

199
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,774
Scott: it December people.

200
00:12:31,814 --> 00:12:33,480
Scott: We actually have time to prepare things.

201
00:12:34,381 --> 00:12:36,207
Scott: Yeah, I know it's it's I don't want.

202
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:36,648
Rym: I don't know.

203
00:12:36,848 --> 00:12:44,687
Scott: cuz see I don't have access to the internal Otakon communications because it's a much more I guess closed Information can compared to other cons.

204
00:12:45,108 --> 00:12:48,500
Scott: so I could just be you know, making up stuff or it could be totally wrong.

205
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,006
Scott: But my first this is my perception.

206
00:12:50,046 --> 00:12:53,300
Scott: I'm soft talking here and I don't speak for the truth of anything.

207
00:12:53,420 --> 00:13:02,897
Scott: But from going on Otakon message boards and proposing many suggestions for the con over the years Many times suggestions that were I think quite good suggestions.

208
00:13:02,977 --> 00:13:10,620
Scott: not all the time But sometimes we're always shot down as saying that will require too much F, you know physical manual labor.

209
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:16,060
Scott: We don't have the people or the time or the manpower and I accepted that answer, you know as okay.

210
00:13:16,341 --> 00:13:21,660
Scott: You can't possibly do this unless you have a whole bunch of money to hire people to do it because it takes forever and whatever.

211
00:13:22,161 --> 00:13:40,939
Scott: But I really I get the feeling personally that the people who run Otakon at least some of them Someone who's doing something is not working as hard or as many hours for the con Outside of the actual hours of the con compared to other conventions, that's the feeling that I get.

212
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:41,180
Scott: granted.

213
00:13:41,301 --> 00:13:43,780
Rym: I mean one don't forget Otakon is still our favorite con.

214
00:13:44,844 --> 00:13:46,973
Scott: It might not be but right now it still is.

215
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:50,072
Rym: as of cons I've been to and two I mean, it's like all these cons.

216
00:13:50,092 --> 00:13:51,020
Rym: That's all volunteer work.

217
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,750
Rym: So while you can't fault someone for not putting in.

218
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,963
Rym: I don't know that like the super effort that we would put into something like That.

219
00:13:57,044 --> 00:14:07,207
Rym: yeah at the same time I have offered every year for the past three years to just handle panels for Otakon and join the staff and No one is.

220
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:10,870
Rym: at once someone said yeah We'll get back with you and they never got back with me.

221
00:14:11,191 --> 00:14:20,813
Rym: and then in person at the con someone said yeah We'll email you and they never emailed me and I just gave up and I got to say of all the cons I've we've ever done panels with even in previous years.

222
00:14:20,913 --> 00:14:23,502
Rym: Otakon really doesn't Respond.

223
00:14:23,683 --> 00:14:30,858
Rym: well these panels that Otakon has never responded to emails in a timely manner and It's really hard to work with them to get a panel going.

224
00:14:31,782 --> 00:14:33,849
Scott: These people they need to remember if you're.

225
00:14:33,869 --> 00:14:35,494
Scott: I mean if I emailed.

226
00:14:35,514 --> 00:14:45,754
Scott: I don't know if I picked a random convention Akon, I guess that's I know that's a convention called Akon right if I emailed them today I would imagine that they would email me back tomorrow or within the week.

227
00:14:45,794 --> 00:14:50,520
Rym: at least that would be like and that would be actually Kind of bad in the very least if it was to a specific department.

228
00:14:50,601 --> 00:14:52,679
Rym: I mean if you just send an email to the con chair of Otakon.

229
00:14:53,364 --> 00:14:55,620
Rym: I don't expect the conjure of Otakon to respond to me.

230
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:02,125
Scott: Like if I had a specific thing like, you know asking for some information or something that wasn't on their website I'm pretty sure they'd get back to me.

231
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:06,480
Scott: Otakon just doesn't get back to people and that's a big problem.

232
00:15:06,701 --> 00:15:10,180
Rym: And uh, I just want that not to again not to name any names.

233
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:20,999
Rym: But there's a couple other people who are staff or should be staff for Otakon who have expressed to me Independently that they have had a lot of hard time getting answers out of anyone else in the Otakon staff.

234
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:27,307
Rym: and Even like the big panels that we do every year No one knows what's going on with them.

235
00:15:27,507 --> 00:15:31,260
Rym: and I'm at the point where I'm assuming that I'm not doing anything at Otakon this year.

236
00:15:31,561 --> 00:15:36,095
Scott: Yeah, I guess all I can say left is we need to work on our communication.

237
00:15:36,176 --> 00:15:37,682
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

238
00:15:37,702 --> 00:15:41,859
Rym: it just bothers me because Otakon is my favorite con and Yeah, I want it.

239
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,270
Rym: I guess I feel like I I mean I'm not.

240
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:55,140
Rym: I want to put my money where my mouth is because we kind of We panned ConnectiCon a little bit last year and ConnectiCon immediately got back with us and said all right hotshots.

241
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,769
Rym: Well, uh, if that's how you feel then are you gonna help out?

242
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:58,833
Rym: and we said damn straight.

243
00:15:59,255 --> 00:15:59,456
Scott: Yep.

244
00:15:59,777 --> 00:16:00,600
Scott: That's exactly right.

245
00:16:01,162 --> 00:16:18,552
Scott: And so now I you know ConnectiCon respect plus plus, you know You might my experience going to your convention as a guest last year might not have you know I meant everything I said and whatever podcast we reviewed it, but now you come up and you're like, all right You know, we're actually cool people, you know, we didn't.

246
00:16:18,773 --> 00:16:19,456
Scott: we can't do everything.

247
00:16:19,476 --> 00:16:23,573
Scott: Not everyone's perfect Not every conventions gonna be perfect and it's not gonna be perfect for everyone.

248
00:16:23,613 --> 00:16:27,940
Scott: But you know you you're talking shit All right, come on and so respect for them.

249
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,899
Scott: But Otakon, you know, they put on this great convention that I enjoy a lot every year.

250
00:16:33,442 --> 00:16:41,360
Rym: But trying to interact with them not making me happy I mean, I just think I'll end it on this and I don't think this is negatistical thing to say.

251
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:57,060
Rym: But I think that despite doing GeekNights and my job and all the other things in my life I could probably handle the panels part of Otakon and respond to every email I got within 24 hours And I probably have all the panels set and done at least five months before the convention.

252
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,840
Rym: In fact, I would require them to be well at least all the fan panels because I know it's hard.

253
00:17:00,941 --> 00:17:02,340
Rym: You got to coordinate with the industry people.

254
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:02,501
Rym: Yeah,

255
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:17,180
Scott: I wouldn't have the schedule of what time and what rooms but I would know You know exactly how many hours worth of panel programming I needed and I would have the people and their and what panels they were doing lined up well in advance

256
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:17,260
Rym: and

257
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,406
Scott: I would not allow that to change.

258
00:17:19,547 --> 00:17:22,380
Scott: unless you know, someone quit on me and I'd have backups too.

259
00:17:22,621 --> 00:17:27,540
Scott: I'd have like okay prepare your panel, but I can't guarantee it'll go on just in case someone else quits.

260
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,283
Rym: yeah, well, I have a lot.

261
00:17:29,384 --> 00:17:35,019
Rym: I know exactly how we would run panels for Otakon or any convention and If Otakon would let us we do it.

262
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:39,500
Rym: But until then we'll see what happens at Otakon because I don't know what we're doing.

263
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,383
Scott: It's not be hilarious.

264
00:17:40,423 --> 00:17:41,086
Scott: He went to Otakon.

265
00:17:41,106 --> 00:17:42,069
Scott: There is no panels.

266
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:45,100
Scott: Yeah, that would be just I don't know.

267
00:17:45,301 --> 00:17:45,742
Rym: You know what?

268
00:17:45,963 --> 00:17:49,839
Rym: I hate to say this and this is really mean to say but it'd be a lot like the previous Otakon.

269
00:17:51,442 --> 00:17:52,426
Rym: I mean not.

270
00:17:52,566 --> 00:18:05,122
Rym: I'm not saying that every panel at well every fan panel at Otakon last year was bad But everyone I attended was really really terrible like below what I would expect from even a mediocre Panel.

271
00:18:05,203 --> 00:18:08,700
Rym: at a con like this Otakon is too big to accept the bad panel.

272
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,753
Scott: There might have been good ones that we you know, didn't attend.

273
00:18:11,773 --> 00:18:13,038
Scott: I guess that's possible.

274
00:18:13,078 --> 00:18:13,580
Rym: There were a few.

275
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,820
Rym: I forget the names offhand, but our listeners did tell us about the one or two panels that were good.

276
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,141
Rym: Yes,

277
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:35,500
Scott: but if your convention is so big as Otakon the biggest anime convention on the East Coast you should have so many panel applications from so many people that you should be able to sift the wheat from the chaff and There's not that much hour, there's not that many hours of panels to actually fill in.

278
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:42,020
Scott: It should be trivial to fill them in with the highest quality panel so that any panel room at any time is awesome.

279
00:18:42,484 --> 00:18:44,440
Scott: It just might not, you know fit someone's taste.

280
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:52,293
Scott: I mean, I might not want to go to a super doll fee super doll fee panel But yeah, but you can have the best damn super doll fee panel in the country right there.

281
00:18:52,313 --> 00:18:52,955
Scott: Yeah team.

282
00:18:53,677 --> 00:18:56,491
Scott: So yeah, whatever Email us Otakon.

283
00:18:56,652 --> 00:18:57,619
Rym: What the hell's your problem?

284
00:18:59,481 --> 00:19:00,526
Scott: Email new invention.

285
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:00,928
Scott: use it.

286
00:19:01,229 --> 00:19:03,600
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I'm I don't want to get one.

287
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,206
Scott: You click the reply button you get one.

288
00:19:05,246 --> 00:19:06,771
Scott: you click the reply button every time.

289
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:07,855
Rym: in the very least.

290
00:19:07,996 --> 00:19:13,420
Scott: what I what you do is If you can't respond to the email like if I ask you like hey who's gonna be the musical guest, right?

291
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,324
Scott: You don't just.

292
00:19:14,465 --> 00:19:16,279
Scott: you don't tell me because you can't tell me yet.

293
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:16,923
Rym: Well, it depends.

294
00:19:16,963 --> 00:19:17,547
Rym: if you ask.

295
00:19:17,627 --> 00:19:19,839
Rym: if I was the con chair, I would ignore an email like that.

296
00:19:20,341 --> 00:19:26,529
Scott: I know I know but like if it was like a well-written professional email right not just like hey some punk kid going Who's the musical guest?

297
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,460
Scott: OMG, right?

298
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:34,712
Scott: But if a professional email comes in you don't just ignore it Even if it's asking for something you don't know or you can't tell you.

299
00:19:34,752 --> 00:19:36,479
Scott: say I regret to inform you blah blah blah.

300
00:19:36,499 --> 00:19:38,306
Scott: at this Time I cannot reveal that information.

301
00:19:38,326 --> 00:19:38,828
Scott: blah blah blah.

302
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,475
Scott: that way at least we know.

303
00:19:40,595 --> 00:19:41,760
Scott: fucking someone read it.

304
00:19:42,001 --> 00:19:44,273
Rym: That's all we want to know is that someone's reading it.

305
00:19:44,555 --> 00:19:51,260
Scott: Someone's paying attention Someone's is doing something, you know, I want to feel like my email didn't just go into the void.

306
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,950
Scott: How do I know a spam filter didn't eat it?

307
00:19:53,654 --> 00:19:54,519
Scott: That's all we need.

308
00:19:54,801 --> 00:19:58,414
Rym: I mean, I guess I put up with this for the last many years because I never really.

309
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:07,593
Rym: I didn't work with many other conventions Until now and now that I've worked with a lot of other conventions I'm starting to see that every other convention is really easy to work with.

310
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:09,780
Scott: Yeah, they just like hey, how you doing?

311
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,743
Rym: You want to thank God?

312
00:20:10,963 --> 00:20:13,873
Rym: Toricon scheduled a panel for us without even asking us.

313
00:20:14,174 --> 00:20:15,760
Scott: Yeah, that was the easiest to work with ever.

314
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,005
Scott: Yeah, all right.

315
00:20:17,025 --> 00:20:17,427
Scott: All right.

316
00:20:17,447 --> 00:20:18,271
Rym: I think we're done with that.

317
00:20:18,411 --> 00:20:21,866
Rym: Yeah, no malice was meant of course But it is.

318
00:20:22,027 --> 00:20:23,011
Scott: it bridges state.

319
00:20:23,293 --> 00:20:37,609
Rym: our personal experience, yeah deep nights full of truthiness great But that aside it's time for things of the day.

320
00:20:38,192 --> 00:20:52,230
Rym: total cop-out, but the fact that it was on dig is kind of lucky because this is one moment in The Simpsons that for some reason is Oftquoted and very often just brought up in casual conversation in the front row crew.

321
00:20:52,812 --> 00:20:56,830
Rym: This exact scene just happened to be on dig today, so it's got to be my thing of the day.

322
00:20:58,052 --> 00:21:01,229
Rym: I don't know if I even want to explain what it is other than must crush.

323
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,881
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

324
00:21:05,143 --> 00:21:12,438
Scott: basically whenever Communism comes up in our group someone inevitably says must crush Capitalism or possibly.

325
00:21:12,459 --> 00:21:13,062
Rym: Yes.

326
00:21:13,102 --> 00:21:17,890
Scott: That's what we wanted you to think Yep, and here is where that came from.

327
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,870
Scott: So now you are part of the inside joke as well and you can lift ten inside jokes.

328
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:25,725
Scott: So my thing of the day Rym doesn't know about this at least.

329
00:21:25,765 --> 00:21:26,930
Scott: I'm pretty sure he doesn't know about this.

330
00:21:27,211 --> 00:21:29,909
Scott: I don't know you didn't but I think you'll be very interested in it.

331
00:21:30,412 --> 00:21:34,390
Scott: It is a recipe and it is a. it's not an Asian recipe.

332
00:21:34,771 --> 00:21:43,910
Scott: So the only way I could but I can relate it to anime day very loosely Because it is involving a rice cooker.

333
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:50,230
Scott: Aha Here is a recipe on how to make something in a rice cooker.

334
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:50,533
Scott: You know what?

335
00:21:50,573 --> 00:21:50,916
Scott: He's gonna.

336
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:52,410
Scott: you know what this recipe tells you how to make it.

337
00:21:53,391 --> 00:21:53,692
Rym: Let's see.

338
00:21:53,732 --> 00:21:54,255
Scott: I'll give you a hint.

339
00:21:54,295 --> 00:21:54,938
Scott: It's not rice.

340
00:21:55,259 --> 00:21:57,087
Rym: Uh, I'm gonna take make a few guesses.

341
00:21:57,268 --> 00:22:02,666
Rym: Uh sponge cake nope, um Stew nope, chili.

342
00:22:02,787 --> 00:22:06,196
Scott: No, uh Flan nope jello.

343
00:22:06,377 --> 00:22:06,558
Scott: Nope.

344
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:07,080
Rym: All right.

345
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,501
Rym: I'm out.

346
00:22:07,983 --> 00:22:09,750
Scott: bread just bread bread.

347
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:13,986
Scott: You say here's a way to make bread in a rice cooker.

348
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,090
Scott: You don't have a bread maker.

349
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,839
Scott: You're afraid to use the oven.

350
00:22:16,859 --> 00:22:18,750
Scott: you want to use a nice safe rice cooker.

351
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,839
Scott: Follow these easy steps at this, you know, it's.

352
00:22:21,859 --> 00:22:22,762
Scott: it's actually a recipe.

353
00:22:22,802 --> 00:22:25,570
Scott: wiki place wiki how the how-to manual.

354
00:22:25,671 --> 00:22:26,155
Scott: You know what?

355
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:27,730
Rym: We've got two rice cookers.

356
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:31,165
Rym: We should take the old rice cooker and try to make bread in it because it certainly doesn't make.

357
00:22:31,185 --> 00:22:37,940
Scott: this guy made like this nice sort of Circular loaf of bread in his rice cooker.

358
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,570
Rym: Was it the size and shape of the inside of a rice cooker?

359
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,835
Scott: Yeah, but it's not.

360
00:22:41,855 --> 00:22:43,810
Scott: it doesn't go up to the full height of the rice cooker.

361
00:22:44,091 --> 00:22:44,514
Scott: Ah, like.

362
00:22:44,554 --> 00:22:47,570
Scott: it's only like a couple inches high and it's circular like here.

363
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:51,190
Scott: Look, it looks sort of like a like a cheese disc, huh?

364
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:56,455
Rym: Only you cut out a wedge of it and eat it whenever we have a free weekend Which will be August at this point.

365
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:57,618
Rym: I might try that.

366
00:22:57,698 --> 00:23:01,910
Scott: Yeah flour yeast sugar salt butter milk water rice cooker.

367
00:23:03,813 --> 00:23:05,769
Scott: So this is pretty cool for anyone out there with rice cooker.

368
00:23:06,332 --> 00:23:18,224
Rym: So we've done a lot of anime and everything lately and every now every time it's like every day that goes by where we don't Talk about comics the comic fans you listen to us Email us bit by bit asking us when we're gonna talk about comics again.

369
00:23:18,345 --> 00:23:19,489
Rym: So I think today's that day.

370
00:23:20,172 --> 00:23:25,430
Scott: Actually this comic we're gonna talk about is kind of funny it because I get lots of comics.

371
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,343
Scott: I mean today how many comics came in the mail?

372
00:23:27,726 --> 00:23:32,470
Rym: Oh my god I came home and there was a box that was somewhat difficult to lift in the front porch.

373
00:23:32,883 --> 00:23:36,830
Scott: Yeah Basically, I pre-order comics two months in advance to get a huge discount.

374
00:23:37,152 --> 00:23:40,810
Scott: Like I get 75% off some things and I get mostly trades.

375
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:47,095
Scott: It's like I'll get like a $20 comic like trade paperback for like $12.

376
00:23:47,095 --> 00:23:49,403
Scott: so pre-ordering two months in advance is totally worth it.

377
00:23:49,463 --> 00:23:49,764
Scott: Yes.

378
00:23:50,045 --> 00:23:57,790
Scott: I'm planning to sell everything I'm never going to read again mostly to shave save shelf space and save money again because I do end up pre-ordering.

379
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:03,615
Scott: I don't get to see what I'm buying before I buy it and sometimes I buy a bad comic most of the times I don't.

380
00:24:03,798 --> 00:24:04,649
Scott: yeah, sometimes I do.

381
00:24:04,871 --> 00:24:09,872
Rym: I mostly use it through Scott to get all of a given manga series that I really like Manga.

382
00:24:09,953 --> 00:24:11,639
Scott: I pre-order manga two months in advance.

383
00:24:11,639 --> 00:24:13,807
Scott: $10 manga for me is like seven dollars.

384
00:24:13,847 --> 00:24:14,690
Scott: Yeah and change.

385
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,425
Rym: So I got chromartie so I plan to get Emma.

386
00:24:16,445 --> 00:24:23,309
Scott: Yep So it's one comic I ordered because I had a whole bunch of hype and I read it and it was pretty good.

387
00:24:23,811 --> 00:24:28,955
Scott: So I usually if I think a comic is pretty good and not underwear pervert Which means Rym will read it.

388
00:24:29,457 --> 00:24:32,657
Scott: then I'll like give it to him say hey read this sometime We'll do it on the show.

389
00:24:32,677 --> 00:24:39,727
Rym: Yeah, basically Scott comes into my room You know while we're doing the show and then afterward He'll usually just plop a comic book on my desk or something or just leave it in my room.

390
00:24:40,129 --> 00:24:44,310
Scott: and Usually Rym doesn't read it or he takes forever and he doesn't read the whole thing.

391
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,201
Rym: It used to be that way because I didn't train to commute.

392
00:24:47,522 --> 00:24:49,670
Rym: So I really had no time to read manga.

393
00:24:49,991 --> 00:24:53,729
Rym: Yeah, but now that I take the train I grab a manga or a comic pretty much every day.

394
00:24:54,271 --> 00:24:58,547
Scott: So this was kind of amazing because I gave it to Rym and like a day later.

395
00:24:58,587 --> 00:24:59,490
Scott: He had read the whole thing.

396
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:00,716
Rym: I was kind of surprised too.

397
00:25:00,897 --> 00:25:04,498
Rym: I mean usually I pick him up flip him through him and then say alright I'll get to this.

398
00:25:04,801 --> 00:25:09,350
Rym: I'll put it at the end of the queue Which means it's never getting read.

399
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:22,230
Rym: Yeah, my cue basically my cue not just my Netflix cue But my life cue has a few things in the front and a few things at the back and I just keep adding things to The middle but I never get to the middle because the middle keeps growing.

400
00:25:22,752 --> 00:25:29,610
Rym: Yep, but no I for some reason read it partly because it was one shot I knew that it would end and there wouldn't be more volumes of it.

401
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:33,790
Rym: So if I liked it, I wouldn't be sucked into this trap of having to read it all like I was with Ex Machina.

402
00:25:34,172 --> 00:25:36,163
Scott: Yeah, Ex Machina is gonna end though.

403
00:25:36,183 --> 00:25:37,048
Scott: I think after like 50 issues.

404
00:25:37,812 --> 00:25:39,864
Scott: So there's only like a few more trades before it's over.

405
00:25:39,884 --> 00:25:40,367
Scott: Don't worry about it.

406
00:25:40,387 --> 00:25:40,930
Rym: Yeah, that's fine.

407
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,950
Rym: But even so this I knew there's no commitment.

408
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:47,510
Rym: I could pick it up put it down and also I'll admit the art was kind of bad.

409
00:25:47,951 --> 00:26:00,730
Rym: So I didn't have my usual problem where I tend to read some comics and some manga But not all manga at all comics Really slowly and generally the better the art is the slower I read it because I spent a lot of time admiring the art.

410
00:26:01,152 --> 00:26:25,550
Scott: Yeah, generally what I do is like I will admire art also in reading comics But like I don't admire the art in every panel like I'll admire just like the amazing panels like if I read Akira like there's certain panels like I know where they are because I've read the whole thing like seven times and Every time I get to them, I'll stop and look at them for like a minute But then as soon as I finish admiring it I'm like burning through the panels and pages and pages pages pages pages.

411
00:26:26,071 --> 00:26:30,283
Scott: But I will go back and admire the art when I'm not reading it like.

412
00:26:30,324 --> 00:26:32,590
Scott: I'll admire the art separately like I'll just open the book.

413
00:26:32,751 --> 00:26:34,830
Rym: Oh, I do that with sanctuary all the time.

414
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:38,910
Rym: I'll just walk over there open a random sanctuary and flip to one of those two page spreads.

415
00:26:39,192 --> 00:26:40,703
Scott: Yeah, or death note.

416
00:26:40,723 --> 00:26:41,590
Scott: I do that sometimes.

417
00:26:42,112 --> 00:26:49,429
Scott: Yeah, actually like a lot of the like I have some DC books where actually I don't like them But this is really nice arts in them, and I'll just look at him.

418
00:26:50,331 --> 00:26:52,317
Scott: But yeah this book the art.

419
00:26:52,658 --> 00:26:54,525
Scott: You know it's not bad art.

420
00:26:54,565 --> 00:26:54,705
Rym: Well.

421
00:26:54,725 --> 00:26:55,588
Rym: It doesn't detract.

422
00:26:55,608 --> 00:26:57,578
Rym: Don't get me wrong It doesn't detract at all from the story.

423
00:26:57,598 --> 00:27:01,297
Scott: It didn't say what the book is yet, and we're already oh We're doing a Dave and Joel here.

424
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:04,090
Rym: I know did we talk about it yet, or did we say what it was?

425
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:04,731
Scott: I think we did.

426
00:27:04,772 --> 00:27:05,835
Scott: I think it's time to do it now.

427
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:06,176
Scott: alright.

428
00:27:06,557 --> 00:27:08,804
Scott: This book is called elks run.

429
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:15,233
Scott: It is by Joshua Hale Fialkov and He I think he's the writer You know.

430
00:27:15,474 --> 00:27:19,809
Rym: I'll just say I had this horrible urge to in in the end after we're done with the show.

431
00:27:20,212 --> 00:27:22,929
Rym: Put the kill bill sound effect over you saying the name of it.

432
00:27:23,231 --> 00:27:28,969
Scott: yep, and the art is by Noel twas on and I'm pronouncing these names wrong probably.

433
00:27:28,989 --> 00:27:33,279
Scott: and Colors by Scott Keating lettered by Jason Hanley.

434
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,370
Scott: chapter title art by Datsun Tran edited by Jason Rodriguez.

435
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,273
Rym: Did you say dr.

436
00:27:38,313 --> 00:27:38,715
Rym: Tran?

437
00:27:38,815 --> 00:27:40,281
Scott: no, but that was close.

438
00:27:40,421 --> 00:27:41,866
Scott: It was Datsun Tran.

439
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:42,810
Rym: That's is a good name.

440
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:43,893
Scott: Yeah, anyway.

441
00:27:44,294 --> 00:27:46,500
Scott: It is published by Villard books.

442
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:47,563
Scott: Which is actually.

443
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:48,907
Scott: I looked up Villard books.

444
00:27:49,589 --> 00:27:52,436
Scott: It's Villard books is basically Random House.

445
00:27:52,878 --> 00:27:53,459
Scott: That's what it is.

446
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:55,886
Scott: Oh, yeah, it's just a thing.

447
00:27:55,906 --> 00:27:58,955
Scott: They're putting on like a lot of like.

448
00:27:58,975 --> 00:28:06,975
Scott: they're actually buying up a lot of cool hip graphic novels like this and Publishing them which is pretty awesome Right.

449
00:28:07,378 --> 00:28:18,640
Rym: so it's a story Basically about an insular community that is created by what Vietnam War veterans I think they're war veterans of some sort.

450
00:28:18,721 --> 00:28:19,463
Scott: It doesn't really matter.

451
00:28:19,483 --> 00:28:20,025
Rym: Basically.

452
00:28:20,447 --> 00:28:21,430
Rym: It's the Michigan militia.

453
00:28:21,811 --> 00:28:22,573
Rym: It's that idea.

454
00:28:22,633 --> 00:28:28,630
Rym: the people who the super survivalists the people who say this country is corrupt or going down the tubes are dangerous or whatever.

455
00:28:29,357 --> 00:28:30,509
Rym: We're true patriots.

456
00:28:30,971 --> 00:28:32,074
Rym: so we're going

457
00:28:32,094 --> 00:28:32,816
Scott: to live in

458
00:28:32,856 --> 00:28:54,117
Rym: the mountains in our own closed community entirely self-reliant with the real Constitution and When the commies eventually come we'll be the ones to hold out or you know That sort of thing the not really a cult so much as just a very very Introverted Introspective closed-off community.

459
00:28:54,618 --> 00:28:57,469
Rym: Yeah, I choice and not by any other reason.

460
00:28:57,629 --> 00:29:08,936
Scott: Yep So you have this this group of people maybe some hundred people or so Maybe a few hundred it's hard to tell and they decide to set up a town in Elks Ridge in the middle of fuck nowhere Where no one was an elks run?

461
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:13,895
Scott: No, I think I think it's Elks Ridge the town of Elks Ridge In West Virginia.

462
00:29:14,076 --> 00:29:15,745
Scott: All right, elks run is the name of the book.

463
00:29:16,509 --> 00:29:22,790
Scott: Ah yes, and It's basically impossible to get in or out of the town except through this tunnel.

464
00:29:23,474 --> 00:29:33,519
Scott: So and the town sort of takes care of itself Except as a guy who drives into the town with a truck full of supplies every week or so Yep, and even does that under the table in cash.

465
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:36,430
Rym: So there's no record in the government anywhere that this town exists.

466
00:29:36,791 --> 00:29:42,470
Scott: Yep, and these people live in seclusion very happily on their own with their crazy ways.

467
00:29:42,631 --> 00:29:47,310
Scott: They're not really that crazy in their ways You know at least as far as you can tell at the beginning of the book.

468
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,642
Rym: Yeah, it definitely starts in this really kind of idyllic.

469
00:29:50,044 --> 00:29:51,170
Rym: Yeah, this is kind of working.

470
00:29:51,511 --> 00:29:56,750
Scott: Yeah, and you know, it's mostly the story starts to focus on the kids who live in this town.

471
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:57,673
Rym: See now think of this.

472
00:29:58,095 --> 00:30:00,283
Rym: these people decide that they want this community.

473
00:30:00,404 --> 00:30:01,950
Rym: All right, they bring their wives.

474
00:30:02,432 --> 00:30:06,607
Rym: All right, the wives are now in on it, but no one's allowed to leave like that's.

475
00:30:06,648 --> 00:30:09,419
Rym: one of the big rules They have is like no one come no one goes out.

476
00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:10,162
Rym: No one comes in.

477
00:30:10,202 --> 00:30:11,950
Rym: It's completely cut off.

478
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:15,590
Rym: They don't want any contact with the outside world because it'll corrupt the kids or whatever.

479
00:30:16,174 --> 00:30:17,445
Rym: But even so it's still a choice.

480
00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:25,840
Rym: now you've got kids being born here who realize that there's an outside world and Realize that something weird is kind of like.

481
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,690
Rym: this is kind of a weird place to be living.

482
00:30:28,174 --> 00:30:29,365
Rym: But yet what are they gonna do about it?

483
00:30:29,385 --> 00:30:29,809
Rym: their kids?

484
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:38,604
Scott: Yeah, mostly, you know You've got the way they make it really frustrating is that like the main characters is teenage boy And there's no girls in town like this.

485
00:30:38,765 --> 00:30:45,207
Scott: one girl in town Maybe and she's like way older than he is like to wear it out in.

486
00:30:45,288 --> 00:30:46,010
Scott: like normal world.

487
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:51,044
Scott: They wouldn't even like consider each other but because they're the only she's the only girl.

488
00:30:51,104 --> 00:30:57,110
Scott: it's sort of like a and that That that talk about frustrating, you know being forced to live in a closed community.

489
00:30:57,532 --> 00:30:58,777
Scott: There are no girls here.

490
00:30:59,239 --> 00:31:00,323
Scott: that there just aren't any.

491
00:31:00,343 --> 00:31:01,488
Scott: it's not that you can't get one.

492
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:06,187
Scott: You're some nerd It's there aren't any and you can't leave to go find some and none will come in.

493
00:31:06,729 --> 00:31:10,390
Rym: now I don't want to ruin any because it's a one-shot, you know one story.

494
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,630
Rym: I don't want to ruin any of the story in this.

495
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:12,811
Rym: I

496
00:31:12,831 --> 00:31:31,421
Scott: think it was originally eight comic book issues and this trade paperback for 1995 manufacturers to just retail price is all eight of those issues in a row with a little bit of fun stuff at the beginning like a little introduction page and a little Is there a prologue page in the back?

497
00:31:31,461 --> 00:31:32,709
Scott: There's an afterword in the back.

498
00:31:33,251 --> 00:31:37,262
Rym: Basically the story without revealing much is that I mean?

499
00:31:37,282 --> 00:31:39,950
Rym: the community is kind of weird and there is tension.

500
00:31:39,990 --> 00:32:06,547
Rym: I mean despite the fact that it seems very ideal and very happy there is tension among many of the people in this community, but it's all kind of below the surface and a small thing happens and the small thing sets into motion a chain of events that Basically inexorably drives the town toward getting into this out-of-control Situation where everything starts to break down and all the things that were under the surface start exploding out.

501
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:09,939
Rym: and it's just an escalation from beginning to end.

502
00:32:09,979 --> 00:32:20,970
Rym: but the pace of the book is such that Everything is constantly at every moment getting more and more intense more and more out of control more and more difficult to deal with.

503
00:32:21,532 --> 00:32:22,676
Scott: Yeah, it definitely.

504
00:32:23,138 --> 00:32:33,079
Scott: it feels pretty awesome just to read it because you you know You keep turning the pages at the same rate and things are just getting Exponentially worse and crazier and worse and crazier and worse.

505
00:32:33,621 --> 00:32:34,222
Scott: and it it's.

506
00:32:34,563 --> 00:32:36,969
Scott: it's sort of like you're on this ride and you can't stop it.

507
00:32:37,653 --> 00:32:40,390
Rym: It's kind of like really this is really off the wall.

508
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:48,205
Rym: But it's kind of like watching the movie strange days Because strange days starts out very slow kind of a mystery detectives police whatever and the.

509
00:32:48,285 --> 00:32:54,710
Rym: it's the pace of the story Just accelerates and accelerates and accelerates and the plot just gets more and more and more out of control.

510
00:32:55,231 --> 00:33:00,550
Rym: Until you gave you get to the end of the movie you you kind of lose track of just how far you've come.

511
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:01,995
Rym: Yeah, and the books the same way.

512
00:33:02,055 --> 00:33:07,537
Rym: by the end of this you're in a place that you never would have expected this book to Go, I've never seen strange days.

513
00:33:07,557 --> 00:33:08,300
Scott: I don't even know what it is.

514
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,054
Scott: But I really ace is also similar to that of Falling down.

515
00:33:12,295 --> 00:33:12,656
Rym: Yes.

516
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:13,399
Rym: Yes.

517
00:33:13,881 --> 00:33:15,968
Rym: This is a lot like falling down only without.

518
00:33:16,409 --> 00:33:17,413
Rym: well You know what.

519
00:33:17,434 --> 00:33:23,576
Rym: the guy and falling down is a little bit like the dead in hooks run Actually just a tiny bit.

520
00:33:23,616 --> 00:33:24,720
Scott: dad and elks run.

521
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,024
Scott: obviously I do not like.

522
00:33:26,285 --> 00:33:30,741
Scott: no the guy in falling down You can kind of go along with like where he's coming from.

523
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:33,210
Scott: the dad and elks run is just wow your bad.

524
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:44,553
Rym: well, I think the main difference is at the end of falling down the guy realizes when he says I'm the bad guy and In this the dead basically says I'm still right.

525
00:33:44,955 --> 00:33:45,757
Scott: I'm still right.

526
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:46,720
Scott: Yeah.

527
00:33:47,202 --> 00:33:48,425
Rym: Yeah, basically.

528
00:33:48,606 --> 00:33:51,135
Scott: Oh, we're not spoiling too much I don't think we really are.

529
00:33:51,437 --> 00:33:58,310
Scott: I don't think cuz I think even if we told you everything that happened And we're not gonna say specifically things that happen So you won't be really spoiled.

530
00:33:58,791 --> 00:34:05,451
Scott: But even if we told you the point of reading this I think is is the ride along the way and not so much Figure.

531
00:34:05,491 --> 00:34:06,976
Scott: it's not like a figuring it out.

532
00:34:07,177 --> 00:34:09,725
Rym: Yeah, cuz the one thing that really draws me.

533
00:34:09,826 --> 00:34:11,110
Scott: It's like being on a roller coaster.

534
00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:16,489
Scott: It's not a mystery that you're gonna get to the bottom of the hill scream a lot and then go up the next hill.

535
00:34:16,891 --> 00:34:17,556
Scott: It's all about.

536
00:34:17,878 --> 00:34:20,763
Scott: we're going down the hill real fast Ain't going whoo?

537
00:34:21,873 --> 00:34:36,313
Rym: but what really grabbed me is that you know, it's a roller coaster ride and all that but it draws you in and It gets to a point where if you're used to reading comics or manga or books or anything you feel like alright I know where this is gonna go I know what's gonna happen.

538
00:34:36,554 --> 00:34:45,164
Rym: like an event happens and after that event you think alright, they're gonna react to it in this way but then no one's gonna do anything and then this is gonna be remembered later.

539
00:34:45,264 --> 00:34:57,089
Rym: and then something, you know, and Basically the characters aren't stupid and the situation progresses very rapidly and every character just immediately does If not what I would do at least something that makes sense.

540
00:34:57,671 --> 00:34:58,955
Rym: Yeah, the situation progresses.

541
00:34:58,995 --> 00:35:04,190
Scott: there were a few times where they had that symptom of you know, like, oh, why don't you just do this?

542
00:35:04,931 --> 00:35:06,076
Scott: Ah, and it doesn't happen.

543
00:35:06,096 --> 00:35:08,709
Scott: and I'm a little upset even though it might happen later earlier.

544
00:35:09,332 --> 00:35:12,328
Scott: It just doesn't happen in like the exact way I wanted to.

545
00:35:12,509 --> 00:35:15,630
Rym: yeah But at least part of that is that they are kids and they really don't know what they're doing.

546
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:21,074
Scott: But it doesn't happen in a way that just makes me put the book down and say fuck this shit that's just stupid but it's just.

547
00:35:21,456 --> 00:35:38,129
Rym: I expected a few tedious parts of the story to appear because they set themselves up like every other piece of media does where if this kind of thing happens then there's this kind of scene or this series of scenes before it's resolved and they basically Skip right over that and cut to the chase.

548
00:35:38,792 --> 00:35:45,017
Scott: I think what it is also is that whenever a thing happens instead of having the typical Expected series of scenes to resolve it.

549
00:35:45,037 --> 00:35:54,830
Scott: It's just the worst possible consequence immediately pops out Yeah, and then something out and then then you have to resolve that with the worst possible consequence.

550
00:35:55,231 --> 00:35:56,556
Rym: I mean, it's one answer the other.

551
00:35:56,837 --> 00:36:00,990
Rym: it's kind of like how Rome fell in that there was no one factor that made Rome fall.

552
00:36:01,211 --> 00:36:05,130
Rym: There's no one factor that made what happens in this comic happen.

553
00:36:05,651 --> 00:36:15,669
Rym: It's that all these little things and all these stupid accidents just kind of all happened at the wrong time And as a result the whole thing just gets out of control.

554
00:36:16,293 --> 00:36:30,780
Scott: Yeah, it's mostly a combination of you know certain people have certain feelings and then certain opportunities arise and everyone sort of acts in their own interest and People are trying to control other people and they can't.

555
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:39,630
Rym: and you know people get pissed off and then ah shit Yep, because if and if you look at it the whole thing stems back from like one of the first scenes.

556
00:36:40,152 --> 00:36:41,659
Rym: I mean all this starts when the kids.

557
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:44,010
Rym: they aren't even trying they're not like they're trying to escape or anything.

558
00:36:44,433 --> 00:36:50,221
Rym: They just kind of go into the tunnel to hang out at night And then things just go out of control from that.

559
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:52,370
Rym: keep saying out of control sort of like an Archduke Ferdinand.

560
00:36:52,831 --> 00:36:56,543
Rym: Yeah, except the Prussians don't come and save the day in this one.

561
00:36:56,623 --> 00:37:00,088
Rym: No, no, I don't think save the day is the operative word for the Prussians did either.

562
00:37:02,531 --> 00:37:09,448
Scott: Yeah, so yeah the art in the book I mean, it's not like it's not something you're gonna sit in awe and look at like whoa.

563
00:37:09,468 --> 00:37:10,090
Scott: Look at that art.

564
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,334
Rym: No, it's very functional art.

565
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,582
Rym: It serves the purpose you get what's going on.

566
00:37:13,863 --> 00:37:15,950
Rym: It doesn't stand out, but it doesn't detract either.

567
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:19,463
Scott: Yep, I mean, it's not like, you know, it's it's not bad.

568
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:22,193
Scott: Like I'm looking at it and I'm like, oh, that's terrible I can't even look at it.

569
00:37:22,555 --> 00:37:26,730
Rym: Yeah, like that, but the characters get really off model a lot all the time.

570
00:37:26,857 --> 00:37:57,030
Scott: Yeah I do notice a few things though that like there's really good Like coloring going on like they're out in the woods like you have all these bright colors and actually they'll draw the characters like with cleaner lines a lot more like a Newspaper comic strip and then like when things are all darkened in the tunnel they'll like sort of paint everyone with this really dark like washes and things and It definitely they do things with the art to go with the mood and enhance the storytelling.

571
00:37:57,614 --> 00:38:05,770
Scott: but it's not art that is so Amazing and attractive to the eye that you want to put a poster on your wall because it's some amazing thing.

572
00:38:06,231 --> 00:38:18,190
Rym: Also, they do something interesting where there's a few there's a section in the middle where there's a bunch of flashbacks to the kids When they were younger kids before before they kind of realized what was going on and it's basically Archie at that point.

573
00:38:18,691 --> 00:38:27,289
Rym: Yeah, yeah, it startled me for a second because when I first whenever I read a comic especially a one-off I always kind of flip through it just to get a sense of it before I read it.

574
00:38:27,751 --> 00:38:34,657
Rym: So I flipped through this and I opened to a random page and I see all this Archie and that really threw off my Expectations for what this was about.

575
00:38:34,717 --> 00:38:35,882
Scott: that'll super throw you off.

576
00:38:36,043 --> 00:38:36,605
Rym: Good God.

577
00:38:36,686 --> 00:38:37,610
Rym: It is not about that.

578
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:38,349
Scott: No, it's not.

579
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:43,489
Rym: I mean, I guess it could be about that if Archie was actually a serial killer at the whole time and he never realized it.

580
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:46,302
Scott: Yeah, but I mean yeah, that would make Archie awesome.

581
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:47,850
Rym: It would think about that.

582
00:38:48,911 --> 00:38:56,910
Scott: Okay, it does show you how they change the style of art to serve the story as opposed to Serving awesome amazing art or anything.

583
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:59,379
Scott: Yeah, plus the wind is fire.

584
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,145
Scott: the way they get the fire in there.

585
00:39:01,306 --> 00:39:02,390
Scott: The fire looks really cool.

586
00:39:02,557 --> 00:39:09,928
Rym: Yeah I must say the way it's painted in there and I gotta say the art does do work very well at the end because there Is a scene like near the end.

587
00:39:10,593 --> 00:39:13,250
Rym: It's kind of like the end of Lord of the Flies.

588
00:39:13,511 --> 00:39:27,050
Rym: Well, remember you actually know anything about Lord of the Flies did the same thing Where the story starts out very slow and methodical and the pace of the bad things that are happening are Just increasing and increasing and increasing and brings you to this feverish pace.

589
00:39:27,572 --> 00:39:31,527
Rym: And then the end of Lord of the Flies is suddenly all the I'm gonna ruin Lord of the Flies.

590
00:39:31,928 --> 00:39:34,190
Rym: Oh shit statute of limitations.

591
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:35,793
Rym: I think all the kids spill

592
00:39:35,933 --> 00:39:36,054
Scott: out

593
00:39:36,615 --> 00:40:00,554
Rym: and there's an adult standing there because he's on the island and suddenly like the cameras just zoomed in and everything's going so fast and suddenly the camera zooms out and you're back in the real world and You're back in normal time and there's this moment of Wow, I came this far this story came this far and you finally get a moment of relief when things finally get resolved and It's a very palpable moment of relief.

594
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:06,315
Scott: Yeah Yeah Another thing is I think the story has the way it's painted and stuff.

595
00:40:06,335 --> 00:40:07,960
Scott: The lighting is actually really cool.

596
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:13,960
Scott: It is it is it's you know, the characters are drawn kind of like not the greatest designs in the universe.

597
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:19,320
Scott: I mean you can recognize which character is which but there's not like super facial expressions going on or anything.

598
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:32,196
Scott: But when there's lights and things it's always like the contrast is like, ooh, look at that You know You can tell like light shining through in caves and shining through windows and all different colors of light.

599
00:40:32,878 --> 00:40:34,983
Scott: It works pretty well All right.

600
00:40:35,505 --> 00:40:35,706
Rym: Yep.

601
00:40:35,846 --> 00:40:42,646
Rym: Also, I'll just point out that I guess the moral or the lesson learned from this is Pretty much right along my thinking.

602
00:40:43,368 --> 00:40:45,756
Rym: it was definitely a validation of things that I believe.

603
00:40:46,459 --> 00:40:56,949
Scott: Oh, yeah Definitely whatever this comic is trying to say whatever you think whatever you think is trying to say after you read it I mean I can tell you what I think is trying to say Well, as long as you don't think yeah those fucking kids.

604
00:40:57,009 --> 00:40:57,892
Rym: It's all their fault.

605
00:40:58,053 --> 00:41:07,260
Scott: Yeah, as long as you don't think that but Yeah, it is definitely Agreeable, you know and it's also because it's so agreeable.

606
00:41:07,863 --> 00:41:11,699
Scott: It's like the guy riding it knows what I think and he thinks the same thing.

607
00:41:12,201 --> 00:41:18,200
Scott: So he purposely puts things in that like especially in the earlier parts that like piss him off and he knows they'll piss me off.

608
00:41:18,326 --> 00:41:24,467
Rym: Yep There's a lot of little bits little knits where a Character does or says something and it just goes.

609
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:32,852
Rym: so against everything that I believe in everything that I am and it's obvious that he's very Deliberately vilifying the characters that he wants you to not like.

610
00:41:32,892 --> 00:41:32,932
Rym: He

611
00:41:32,952 --> 00:41:51,870
Scott: basically makes the people so He vilifies them so perfectly that it's like an instant bad guy Like you'll read like a superhero comic and they'll be like this evil looking dark guy who's fighting the superhero And you won't hate that guy even 1,000th as much as you hate some of the people in this thing.

612
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,454
Scott: Yeah, it's like Magneto.

613
00:41:53,474 --> 00:41:56,512
Scott: Hey, you can be kind of cool Magneto I feel sorry.

614
00:41:56,552 --> 00:42:02,015
Scott: Yeah, I like The man yeah, but like the normal guy on the street.

615
00:42:02,075 --> 00:42:05,306
Scott: and this is like fuck you asshole God damn that guy.

616
00:42:05,326 --> 00:42:06,450
Scott: I hope he dies right now.

617
00:42:06,711 --> 00:42:09,400
Scott: I hope he dies before he was even in the book at all.

618
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:20,738
Rym: Yeah I gotta say there are some characters that when they get if and when certain characters get what's coming to them I actually stopped and in a moment, I thought it's about time damn straight.

619
00:42:21,019 --> 00:42:23,046
Scott: Yeah Yeah, and it's only eight issues.

620
00:42:23,146 --> 00:42:30,213
Scott: So, you know, even though you might be suffering for like maybe 20 minutes You'll read this whole thing in one shot and you'll you at the end.

621
00:42:30,253 --> 00:42:31,960
Scott: you won't be a roller coaster.

622
00:42:32,362 --> 00:42:36,278
Rym: It pulls you to the top it throws you down and then it's over and you're walking back to the car.
