00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,330
Rym: It's Monday April 18th 2016.

2
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:20,859
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight Crypto ransomware and why it can really only fuck you if you're dumb.

3
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,443
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:23,464 --> 00:00:27,255
Rym: Oh my god.

5
00:00:27,315 --> 00:00:28,559
Scott: It's warm.

6
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:31,144
Rym: Yeah And then it was cold.

7
00:00:31,204 --> 00:00:33,207
Rym: It was warm and it was cold that I thought it was summer.

8
00:00:33,307 --> 00:00:42,371
Rym: then it snowed and In fact, I didn't even do.

9
00:00:42,492 --> 00:00:47,500
Rym: usually there's a bunch of stuff I do to my bike because I like I grease it up in the winter because I do use it occasionally.

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,785
Rym: You know salt and all that nastiness.

11
00:00:49,106 --> 00:00:52,540
Rym: so I put heavy grease on and then I switch it for summer grease in the spring.

12
00:00:53,261 --> 00:01:03,880
Rym: I hadn't done the switch up yet because the weather had been coming and going but it was so nice today I was like fuck it and I just bike to work anyway and halfway through the bike ride Of course squeaky squeaky squeaky squeaky squeaky.

13
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:10,560
Rym: So I've stopped and bought some teflon and lubed it up and it's it's spring now and we bike to work every day.

14
00:01:10,985 --> 00:01:11,738
Rym: I feel real good.

15
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,992
Scott: hmm So I'm sure at this point in time was like 2015 2016. now.

16
00:01:17,012 --> 00:01:19,701
Scott: It's 2016.

17
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:24,183
Scott: Yeah, people have heard like this babymetal thing that's going around Right.

18
00:01:24,364 --> 00:01:27,579
Scott: Yeah, and because I internet I knew about this a long time ago.

19
00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:35,728
Scott: Right as I know tend to know about a lot of things in advance because I internet so much But I usually what happens is I'll be like man.

20
00:01:35,748 --> 00:01:37,071
Scott: There's this thing.

21
00:01:37,092 --> 00:01:38,936
Scott: I knew about it before you.

22
00:01:38,997 --> 00:01:42,971
Scott: I'm so cool like a hipster But in this case, I was so wrong.

23
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:45,580
Scott: I was the wrongest that you could be All right.

24
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,760
Scott: When I first saw babymetal, which was like they're actually I think they started like way back when they were in like middle school.

25
00:01:54,345 --> 00:01:56,340
Scott: And at that point they were in middle school.

26
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:58,980
Scott: They were really small and they didn't have a band or anything.

27
00:01:59,081 --> 00:02:07,956
Scott: It was actually the sort of like an offshoot of like a regular old idol group or whatever Right and when I first saw it, it was pretty much just oh, yeah, that makes sense.

28
00:02:07,996 --> 00:02:09,080
Scott: It's a weird Japan thing.

29
00:02:09,341 --> 00:02:10,669
Scott: I've seen those like a million times.

30
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:12,460
Scott: I mean how many Japan things like that?

31
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,940
Rym: I mean, that was the era where weird Japan was just like an even regular old pop culture, right?

32
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,148
Scott: It's like you always see up.

33
00:02:19,168 --> 00:02:20,960
Scott: There's another thing that's weird from Japan.

34
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:26,300
Scott: They combine two things that hadn't been combined before or they took something from someone else and redid it, right?

35
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,645
Scott: Yeah, so it's like okay.

36
00:02:27,665 --> 00:02:30,880
Scott: They made an idol group that happens to have metal music in the background.

37
00:02:30,981 --> 00:02:33,179
Scott: That's a cute one-shot thing, right?

38
00:02:34,002 --> 00:02:34,243
Scott: You know.

39
00:02:34,323 --> 00:02:39,885
Scott: and then you know, I saw it again and I'm like, oh maybe like two years ago I think maybe one or two years ago.

40
00:02:39,905 --> 00:02:44,440
Scott: I saw it again and I'm like, oh, I guess that kept going that thing, right?

41
00:02:45,941 --> 00:02:48,690
Scott: It's still not really a big deal, right?

42
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,776
Scott: You know, it's it's you know weird thing.

43
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:54,889
Scott: It's not commonly known It's just some you know, it's just a j-pop idol group.

44
00:02:54,929 --> 00:02:55,691
Scott: That's not good.

45
00:02:55,731 --> 00:03:06,560
Scott: It's like perfect blue only it's metal right big deal Right, so and they you know, they were like, I know that they opened when like Lady Gaga had this weird tour in 2014.

46
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:15,106
Scott: I think that was like the art pop tour the art rave or something because crayon pop opened for that and like she originally wanted Crayon pop to open for the whole thing.

47
00:03:15,126 --> 00:03:16,230
Scott: I think couldn't.

48
00:03:16,671 --> 00:03:19,300
Scott: so babymetal opened for the other ones, right?

49
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:23,656
Scott: And I was like, oh, I guess they're still around right, but I didn't really care.

50
00:03:23,676 --> 00:03:24,700
Rym: is where this is going, right?

51
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,840
Scott: I didn't care or like them at all, right?

52
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:35,369
Scott: So then of course recently I'm sure now everyone knows who they are because they performed on Colbert's show Which used to be Letterman show which has a history.

53
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:43,158
Scott: actually if people aren't aware of letting weird acts perform Yeah at the end of the show like going back to like PB Herman and even earlier, right?

54
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:52,690
Scott: It's like a lot of people became famous You know in the United States because they were their weird-ass act was able to perform on that show Regardless of who is hosting it, right?

55
00:03:53,052 --> 00:03:54,258
Scott: So now everyone knows who they are.

56
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:58,492
Scott: So because they came back again and like this is like.

57
00:03:58,512 --> 00:04:01,160
Scott: I've seen them now multiple times over the years.

58
00:04:01,862 --> 00:04:06,093
Scott: I was like why like I was like, why are they still here?

59
00:04:06,353 --> 00:04:06,534
Scott: Right?

60
00:04:06,574 --> 00:04:08,960
Scott: This is like a one-shot gimmick deal, right?

61
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,763
Scott: Isn't this a gimmick?

62
00:04:09,924 --> 00:04:11,851
Scott: How is this gimmick continuing to last?

63
00:04:12,112 --> 00:04:13,920
Rym: Well, is it a gimmick if you're the only one?

64
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,642
Rym: I mean, it's not.

65
00:04:14,742 --> 00:04:20,240
Rym: they're not quite guar level of like having the legend of Krauser happening there.

66
00:04:21,081 --> 00:04:24,574
Scott: That is how I was wrong because after they appeared on Colbert.

67
00:04:24,594 --> 00:04:26,320
Scott: I said, why are they still here this gimmick?

68
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,605
Scott: Why is this not gone?

69
00:04:27,766 --> 00:04:33,170
Scott: This one this one-shot deal, so I looked into it Secretly without me noticing.

70
00:04:33,472 --> 00:04:38,819
Scott: for these past two years They have done something that I didn't realize could be done, right?

71
00:04:39,602 --> 00:04:42,459
Scott: And that is they are not what I thought they were.

72
00:04:42,981 --> 00:04:49,340
Scott: I thought that they were a Japanese idol group that happened to have metal music in the background.

73
00:04:49,761 --> 00:04:53,312
Scott: Right, you know of their regular idol songs and whatever.

74
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,499
Scott: right that is not what they are.

75
00:04:56,144 --> 00:05:02,800
Scott: Babymetal is Actually a completely legit metal band that happens to have Japanese idols.

76
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,227
Rym: Wait, so you'd never listen to them like you?

77
00:05:05,247 --> 00:05:06,451
Rym: never no no.

78
00:05:06,491 --> 00:05:07,012
Scott: No, it's not.

79
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:09,600
Scott: I mean, it's not the music that is legit, right?

80
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:21,035
Scott: first of all when they got a band to back them up instead of just like a recording that helped a lot because The band that backs them up known as the kami band Right the god band is like literally.

81
00:05:21,075 --> 00:05:21,900
Scott: they went around Japan.

82
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,226
Scott: I got like the best drummer.

83
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:31,300
Scott: the best guitar is the bit like the best people that they could find Right and they made this band like the drummer used to be in the blue man group and the bassist is like this.

84
00:05:31,621 --> 00:05:34,312
Rym: Used to be in the blue man group is not a significant.

85
00:05:34,613 --> 00:05:36,400
Scott: It's not easy to be in the blue man group.

86
00:05:37,742 --> 00:05:38,886
Scott: You got to be talented to be.

87
00:05:38,926 --> 00:05:40,071
Rym: I'm saying there's a lot of them like.

88
00:05:40,111 --> 00:05:42,260
Rym: there's a lot of skilled percussionists in the world.

89
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:43,964
Scott: He's really good, right?

90
00:05:43,984 --> 00:05:45,168
Rym: I'm not saying he's not.

91
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:46,752
Scott: the bassist is some crazy six.

92
00:05:46,772 --> 00:05:48,256
Rym: There's a lot of big man.

93
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:52,125
Scott: There are many yes But anyway, right.

94
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:57,560
Scott: so they got like the totally like the sickest band that you could get of Japanese musicians or whatever.

95
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:12,400
Scott: But like if you go online and look for performances that aren't say on late-night American TV It's like they've been performing it like Gigantic music festival in the UK with like a hundred thousand metalheads and shit, right?

96
00:06:13,184 --> 00:06:20,898
Scott: And I realized watching this that like oh my god This was the secret that all the other Japanese shit has not been able to do right.

97
00:06:21,461 --> 00:06:28,573
Scott: It's like if you look at like you go to the complex store For example, right and you see the manga and the manga is separate right?

98
00:06:28,653 --> 00:06:30,417
Scott: It's not with the other comics.

99
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:34,614
Scott: It's Japanese comics, it's Japanese first and comic.

100
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:35,800
Rym: Oh, I see we're going with this.

101
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:42,560
Rym: So they were just popular among metal people but not as a Japanese weird thing just as metal.

102
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:48,760
Scott: Yes, every metal band has a gimmick right, you know Blind Guardian has a Lord of the Rings gimmick, right?

103
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,144
Rym: What was Metallica's gimmick?

104
00:06:50,626 --> 00:06:51,609
Scott: No, they don't have a gimmick.

105
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:52,231
Scott: That's their game.

106
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:54,599
Scott: They're the only metal band that doesn't have a gimmick.

107
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:01,350
Scott: AC/DC has like the schoolboy thing going on You know, it's like market machine.

108
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:04,380
Scott: supremacy has the Commodore 64 thing going on.

109
00:07:04,902 --> 00:07:05,464
Scott: You know every.

110
00:07:05,584 --> 00:07:10,100
Scott: you know, Ramstein has the ridiculous stage things going on flaming penises.

111
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,880
Scott: Every metal band you can think of has some kind of gimmick, right?

112
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:36,345
Scott: This is a baby metal is a completely normal metal band right of Relatively moderate to high quality and that just has and their gimmick just happens to be Japanese high school girls Right, and I realized all the other Japanese stuff that can't break in right is because it's all the other cool Japan shit, right?

113
00:07:36,686 --> 00:07:40,299
Scott: It's because it makes itself Japanese first instead of what it is first.

114
00:07:41,183 --> 00:07:45,227
Rym: Like we've always said, you know, not that it's not Wednesday But with anime just take a show.

115
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:48,440
Rym: that would be you know appeal to a demographic and just put it on.

116
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,344
Scott: So this is so.

117
00:07:49,384 --> 00:08:02,109
Scott: it's the fact that they're still there and they're that as big as they are I didn't realize just how big they were is proof right that the things that we've been saying all along are True and would really work if you were smart enough to try them.

118
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:07,545
Scott: and apparently whoever runs this shit there at baby metal incorporated Knows what the hell they're doing.

119
00:08:07,706 --> 00:08:09,451
Rym: Are they actually baby metal incorporated?

120
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,193
Rym: Did you just call them that?

121
00:08:10,213 --> 00:08:10,775
Scott: because it's some.

122
00:08:10,876 --> 00:08:12,320
Scott: it's some like something entertainment company.

123
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,540
Rym: I just wondered if you're like baby metal incorporated because that's literally what they are technically call.

124
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,313
Scott: I mean baby metal is probably making all the money that they make now.

125
00:08:19,434 --> 00:08:21,583
Scott: Yeah, I can't imagine the Like.

126
00:08:21,603 --> 00:08:22,848
Scott: they were the other idol groups.

127
00:08:22,888 --> 00:08:23,590
Scott: they have whatever.

128
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,697
Scott: I can't imagine they're making a lot of money, right?

129
00:08:25,717 --> 00:08:32,807
Scott: Yeah So actually they have some crazy world tour going on now, right which is why they were performing and whatnot.

130
00:08:32,827 --> 00:08:36,279
Scott: because they guess their second album came out at the beginning of April or whatever.

131
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:40,260
Scott: and So I was like, oh I wonder where this world tour is going.

132
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,820
Scott: The world tour is ending and like some extravaganza at the Tokyo Dome like later in the year

133
00:08:45,021 --> 00:08:45,784
Rym: I'm not going to that

134
00:08:46,186 --> 00:08:49,161
Scott: it's gonna be in New York on May the 4th May

135
00:08:49,201 --> 00:08:50,426
Rym: the old Star Wars day

136
00:08:50,828 --> 00:08:53,660
Scott: and it was sold out something like oh, oh well stub hub.

137
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,487
Scott: I went on stub hub and you know what?

138
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:56,351
Scott: It was cheap.

139
00:08:56,813 --> 00:08:57,596
Rym: Oh, do you get tickets?

140
00:08:57,857 --> 00:08:58,620
Scott: I bought one ticket.

141
00:08:58,901 --> 00:08:59,865
Rym: I guess I'm fine.

142
00:08:59,905 --> 00:09:00,508
Scott: Maybe we should go.

143
00:09:00,668 --> 00:09:01,773
Scott: I figured why not?

144
00:09:01,793 --> 00:09:05,600
Scott: Yeah, it was like Okay, I'm not going to Hong Kong.

145
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:15,034
Scott: It's on Wednesday and it's like four blocks from my office and it's like well Why be alive if I'm not gonna go?

146
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:19,287
Scott: it's right there Also get tickets and it's at the.

147
00:09:19,528 --> 00:09:21,615
Scott: it's at you know, I guess it's not it used to be.

148
00:09:21,755 --> 00:09:23,120
Rym: is it seating or like GA?

149
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:24,324
Scott: It's GA.

150
00:09:24,384 --> 00:09:29,160
Scott: So it's that ensure making sure it's at the PlayStation theater, which used to be the Nokia theater.

151
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,091
Rym: Oh be I know where that is.

152
00:09:31,272 --> 00:09:32,680
Scott: Yeah, I think we saw Blind Guardian.

153
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,480
Rym: We did see Blind Guardian there, right?

154
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,853
Rym: So like that was that that was one of the Rym is an old man.

155
00:09:37,873 --> 00:09:39,540
Rym: concerts cuz we went and it was great.

156
00:09:40,102 --> 00:09:45,340
Rym: There was the front rivers mosh and whatever and we all went to the back and sat in those seats.

157
00:09:45,521 --> 00:09:47,930
Rym: I just enjoyed the concert sitting there enjoying the music.

158
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,536
Scott: I got new earplugs - I haven't used them yet.

159
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:50,439
Scott: Yeah, but yeah.

160
00:09:52,061 --> 00:09:55,252
Scott: So like I've been sort of like once I realized what I had missed.

161
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:59,123
Scott: right that's sort of and it's all on Spotify by the Way all their music.

162
00:09:59,283 --> 00:10:08,040
Scott: so that sort of occupied my brain for like a whole day As soon as I realized what I had not paid attention to and was wrong about.

163
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:35,493
Rym: So in terms of occupying people's brains This is most people are associating what I'm about to bring up with games the video game industry all that But it is equally associated but less talked about in tech and almost every modern profession that involves coding technology art anything and while this is not specifically technology it is Really important to talk about and it's also so close to all these issues.

164
00:10:36,115 --> 00:10:36,998
Scott: and oh this guy.

165
00:10:37,038 --> 00:10:39,306
Rym: Yeah this guy Okay, so it's like yes.

166
00:10:39,346 --> 00:10:51,664
Rym: We know this is not technically technology, but it's too close to home and Never before has there been an individual person who so exemplifies these toxic fucking attitudes Like I.

167
00:10:51,724 --> 00:10:52,607
Scott: can I mean well this?

168
00:10:52,687 --> 00:10:56,600
Scott: this is something that is a constant rumble which with occasional spikes, right?

169
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,671
Scott: But this is the largest spike in this discussion that has ever occurred.

170
00:11:01,072 --> 00:11:05,606
Scott: so far despite me constantly trying to make it spike I haven't been able to do so.

171
00:11:05,907 --> 00:11:09,600
Scott: I guess you need the troll to make it spike and not be smart beavers.

172
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,349
Rym: Well, I think part of the reason it's spiking is that Alex st.

173
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:17,029
Rym: John the shithead we're talking about to talk about is in Relation to John st.

174
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:17,290
Scott: John.

175
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,256
Rym: No who is amazing.

176
00:11:18,276 --> 00:11:19,020
Scott: Oh, he's a video.

177
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:19,600
Scott: That's right.

178
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:27,280
Scott: the video game aspect brought in the extra community power and not just the up because the last spike was the Second biggest spike was the EA guy.

179
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,825
Scott: Yeah, right and he was.

180
00:11:28,865 --> 00:11:30,831
Scott: that was also games that I haven't seen.

181
00:11:30,851 --> 00:11:40,660
Rym: a lot of spikes in this just in pure technology area and I think it's partly because Game development like people assume and expect both publicly and privately that it's awful.

182
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:44,014
Rym: But this is more whispered in technology.

183
00:11:44,054 --> 00:11:44,817
Rym: Like you don't have nothing.

184
00:11:44,878 --> 00:11:45,400
Scott: It's whispered.

185
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:46,264
Scott: I think it's just.

186
00:11:46,546 --> 00:11:47,631
Scott: you know, I think it's technology.

187
00:11:47,691 --> 00:11:48,254
Scott: people like it.

188
00:11:48,435 --> 00:11:55,950
Rym: I have okay, so I'll put it this way I have never seen someone who has a slideshow of the presentation He gave on how to hire people.

189
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,060
Rym: that literally spells out.

190
00:11:58,321 --> 00:12:02,754
Rym: It'd be like if the Communist Party in Soviet Russia legit was like.

191
00:12:03,135 --> 00:12:04,960
Rym: here's the slide on how we will oppress the work.

192
00:12:05,403 --> 00:12:09,788
Rym: Here's the slide on how this is just animal farm Like it is.

193
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,083
Rym: so the deal is Someone.

194
00:12:12,505 --> 00:12:15,274
Rym: Dean Takahashi just wrote this article which was pretty smart.

195
00:12:15,414 --> 00:12:16,819
Rym: He's basically like look he's okay guy.

196
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:25,480
Rym: Yeah He's like look video games have a problem and that we have perpetual crunch like due to poor planning and poor expectations and exploitation.

197
00:12:26,001 --> 00:12:32,900
Rym: We expect video game developers to work 70 80 hour weeks when there's literally no reason for it to be that way.

198
00:12:33,163 --> 00:12:36,150
Rym: no, and Alex st.

199
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:42,574
Rym: John on venture beat decided to write an article in response to that.

200
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:48,472
Rym: what I'm reading from is Rami Ismail who wrote a response to Alex st.

201
00:12:48,552 --> 00:12:56,638
Rym: John's response to Dean Takahashi Where he basically eviscerated this guy, but the gist of the article was that?

202
00:12:58,102 --> 00:13:13,749
Rym: People in Video games but you can apply this orthogonally tackle obviously need to work Crazy hours and not have hobbies outside of their work and dedicate their entire lives to their job or else They've fallen victim to the.

203
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:14,793
Rym: what is it?

204
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,639
Rym: the wage slave attitude?

205
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:24,000
Rym: Uh-huh that and he goes on and on about how you should feel privileged to work like this.

206
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,292
Rym: All you're doing is pushing a mouse around.

207
00:13:26,312 --> 00:13:27,820
Rym: you're not doing real work.

208
00:13:28,081 --> 00:13:28,966
Rym: So why would you?

209
00:13:29,006 --> 00:13:31,178
Rym: why do you feel like you should have to only work like 40 hours?

210
00:13:31,801 --> 00:13:33,379
Rym: Why do you feel like you should go home and see kids?

211
00:13:34,642 --> 00:13:36,658
Scott: Because I'm not a loser like you as a life.

212
00:13:37,189 --> 00:13:41,939
Scott: Yeah I have things to do beside if I only work because I have to not because I want to.

213
00:13:42,502 --> 00:13:49,144
Scott: there's not my fault that you have nothing in your entire life other than work that fulfills you and you're a pile of human garbage.

214
00:13:49,325 --> 00:13:57,040
Rym: and he's basically arguing that the idea of work-life balance is a myth and that you Cannot exist in the games.

215
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:02,680
Scott: It sounds like someone who has no life and just wants no others to have a life because that makes him feel bad.

216
00:14:03,763 --> 00:14:09,196
Rym: It's a it's a lot like Like, you know, we gave Cliffy B a chance when he gave that keynote at PAX.

217
00:14:09,257 --> 00:14:09,880
Rym: I was like, you know what?

218
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,361
Rym: I'll listen.

219
00:14:10,402 --> 00:14:11,306
Rym: I'll hear this guy out.

220
00:14:11,407 --> 00:14:13,256
Scott: I mean, I listen to David Jaffe.

221
00:14:13,296 --> 00:14:13,979
Scott: Listen, it could be.

222
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,349
Scott: Yeah, maybe he's better than David Jaffe stuff.

223
00:14:16,469 --> 00:14:17,092
Rym: That is true.

224
00:14:17,413 --> 00:14:18,116
Rym: That is true.

225
00:14:18,196 --> 00:14:19,200
Scott: That doesn't say he's good.

226
00:14:20,241 --> 00:14:22,570
Scott: He's a less smelly poop of the same flavor.

227
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,016
Rym: He's pooping is.

228
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:24,960
Scott: they're both poops.

229
00:14:25,121 --> 00:14:27,420
Scott: One of them is like a diarrhea and one of them just some turds.

230
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:33,431
Rym: But Cliffy B's didn't really come out until later when unrelated to that keynote But he said a bunch of crap online.

231
00:14:33,451 --> 00:14:39,599
Scott: We're like, okay He seemed at the keynote like he knew better and he was trying but he just couldn't hide it.

232
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,839
Scott: Yep, he couldn't hold it in but him too like this.

233
00:14:43,381 --> 00:14:54,599
Rym: they have this like ridiculous idea of how tech workers should live their lives and they're sort of building this narrative to try to almost demonize people who have social lives or

234
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,083
Scott: because they don't want

235
00:14:56,123 --> 00:15:09,694
Rym: to work 40 or 50 hours a week tops and do other things in the rest of their time and It wouldn't be that much news except that because of this teardown of it Everyone's talking about this.

236
00:15:09,856 --> 00:15:12,880
Scott: finally I've been trying to get people to talk about this for a long time.

237
00:15:13,502 --> 00:15:20,784
Scott: Because all you see on the startup things are people glorifying the you know, eat ramen, you know live in a startup house Get paid with.

238
00:15:20,904 --> 00:15:26,373
Scott: you know lottery tickets kind of culture and I'm every place that calls me to try to hire me has that Culture and I say oh fuck you, right?

239
00:15:27,924 --> 00:15:30,820
Scott: And that makes it pretty hard to find any place to work besides where I'm working.

240
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,624
Rym: Exactly because

241
00:15:32,644 --> 00:15:48,210
Scott: like even though this guy seems like a like a you know, a crazy evil person Why if he's so crazy evil wide and he's you know, like a rare case of this crazy evil How come every single tech startup is act is doing basically what he says even if they're not writing the articles that he's?

242
00:15:48,471 --> 00:15:48,833
Scott: Alex St.

243
00:15:48,853 --> 00:15:50,058
Scott: John is writing this.

244
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:56,240
Scott: someone who Runs the place has his attitude because all their people are working a ridiculous hours and not having lives.

245
00:15:56,441 --> 00:15:58,571
Scott: Yeah, I mean basically if you have I went to interview at a place.

246
00:15:58,611 --> 00:15:59,113
Scott: there are people.

247
00:15:59,455 --> 00:16:00,440
Scott: they had a fancy kitchen.

248
00:16:00,922 --> 00:16:06,405
Scott: People were cooking and eating dinner in there as like a group like it was a family and it's like whoa Get the fuck out of here.

249
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:06,967
Scott: No way.

250
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:14,339
Rym: Am I working here now I could see situations I know you wouldn't do this But like if I owned a company or if I really cared about something like.

251
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:15,531
Scott: so He's this guy Alex St.

252
00:16:15,551 --> 00:16:16,360
Scott: John owns a company.

253
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,126
Scott: He really cares.

254
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:19,100
Scott: he expects his workers to care as much as he does.

255
00:16:19,381 --> 00:16:31,806
Rym: I don't think he actually really cares because reading everything he's written It feels a lot like Cliffy B's stuff where these are like the rent takers in the industry who aren't actually Personally contributing that much.

256
00:16:32,288 --> 00:16:35,078
Scott: No, I mean people who managers don't contribute much.

257
00:16:35,158 --> 00:16:38,620
Rym: in general They do I think in well-functioning organizations.

258
00:16:39,063 --> 00:16:45,880
Rym: But like the problem is like in video games people expect like, uh You're gonna have to work like crazy hours for the last eight months of game development.

259
00:16:45,941 --> 00:17:01,986
Rym: Like no that means you fucked up Wave way earlier in the project and now you're choosing to pay that cost with the lives of your workers Instead of just by pushing out deadlines, you know, whenever we talk about like Project management, especially in software.

260
00:17:02,247 --> 00:17:04,473
Scott: We always talk about the space shuttle.

261
00:17:04,714 --> 00:17:07,685
Scott: Yeah, and we're like, yeah, we're not building the space shuttle What the fuck do we care right?

262
00:17:07,988 --> 00:17:10,240
Rym: Oh, yeah, because you had that article about how they built the space shuttle.

263
00:17:10,521 --> 00:17:22,160
Scott: Yeah, there is actually an article I read recently that was like here is actually the software process They use to write the space shuttle software and I was like, oh now we know exactly how they do it.

264
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,108
Scott: And it's like well, it's not agile.

265
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,173
Scott: No, it's fuck.

266
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:26,056
Scott: No, it's not agile.

267
00:17:26,137 --> 00:17:30,459
Scott: and also Now I know exactly to what extent I never have to go.

268
00:17:32,602 --> 00:17:34,629
Rym: You know, what sucks doesn't really suck that much.

269
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:39,087
Scott: but also if you're building something super serious like a space shuttle Why aren't you doing what they do?

270
00:17:39,488 --> 00:17:43,746
Rym: So in my industry, you know Wall Street crap Is the space shuttle.

271
00:17:43,866 --> 00:17:46,777
Rym: so I have some projects like some things that don't matter that much.

272
00:17:46,837 --> 00:17:49,223
Rym: so yeah agile Let's just push out a bill Let's go.

273
00:17:49,243 --> 00:18:00,119
Rym: and there's other things where I will personally spend like six months Writing a spec like a giant book of the Bible that says here's what this thing needs to do And here's how it needs to be architected.

274
00:18:00,561 --> 00:18:05,676
Rym: That is like 100% like the stakeholders have signed off like the regulators like everyone is like.

275
00:18:05,696 --> 00:18:07,100
Rym: this is exactly what we're building.

276
00:18:07,381 --> 00:18:09,189
Rym: We understand it a hundred percent and then we build it.

277
00:18:09,812 --> 00:18:14,300
Rym: not everything I do needs to be that way But that's kind of orthogonal to this point.

278
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:21,130
Scott: So I want you all but the point is that if you do that kind of stuff, right these management hours Issues aren't an issue, right?

279
00:18:21,231 --> 00:18:21,754
Scott: It's it right.

280
00:18:21,775 --> 00:18:22,580
Scott: That's how it's related.

281
00:18:22,681 --> 00:18:27,708
Scott: It's a matter of you care building things the right way and not you know Doing some agile nonsense bullshit.

282
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:33,927
Scott: then, you know exactly how long things are gonna take you People and divide the labor properly.

283
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,291
Rym: you might be wrong, but there's a big.

284
00:18:35,712 --> 00:18:38,160
Scott: it's gonna be way less off than eight months of crunch.

285
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:42,008
Rym: There's a big difference between oh shit We're falling a little behind.

286
00:18:42,048 --> 00:18:42,510
Rym: can we work?

287
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:50,494
Rym: everyone work one extra weekend and work fine And then I'll give you all vacation after the games out versus yeah eight months of 80-hour weeks.

288
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,299
Rym: Oh, and we're still behind.

289
00:18:52,399 --> 00:19:06,360
Rym: so But I really want all of you gaming industry taking serving to read Every word that this jackass road because you need to understand that this is like this is exactly What the people who ask you to work late day after day are thinking in their heads.

290
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:17,100
Scott: I also want to just remind people the reason that these people can get away with this attitude is Because people agree to work for them and people who do work for them don't unionize and don't assert themselves.

291
00:19:17,321 --> 00:19:24,471
Scott: Right, if you go and someone like asshole like this is trying to hire you I don't care how badly you need a job say fuck no, right?

292
00:19:24,491 --> 00:19:25,996
Scott: I mean, would you rather be?

293
00:19:26,016 --> 00:19:27,200
Scott: I mean if you're unemployed?

294
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:31,358
Rym: There's a level of privilege there Scott in that I pretty much get a job anytime I need to.

295
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:35,122
Scott: if I Was between even if I couldn't get a job I would just.

296
00:19:35,243 --> 00:19:39,720
Scott: I would rather work at Starbucks than work at some ridiculous asshole place like this, right?

297
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,816
Scott: I'll just move out of my apartment rather than destroy my entire life for someone else.

298
00:19:43,856 --> 00:19:44,900
Scott: What's the point of being alive?

299
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,060
Scott: What is the point of being alive if you're spending all your time?

300
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:54,360
Scott: Just sacrificing all of your meant your you your young years your years of youth that you're able to work, right?

301
00:19:55,060 --> 00:20:00,440
Scott: Giving a hundred percent of your entire mental capacity to this other person for their garbage, whatever the fuck it is.

302
00:20:00,681 --> 00:20:03,599
Scott: So I would rather just be poor than do that.

303
00:20:03,841 --> 00:20:07,860
Rym: It goes way beyond that and that it really illustrates the sort of tech bro bullshit.

304
00:20:08,022 --> 00:20:14,260
Scott: And if everyone has the attitude I have Then those people won't be able to force anyone to do that anymore because nobody will agree to work for them.

305
00:20:14,501 --> 00:20:16,915
Rym: You really need to look at the slides that this guy posted.

306
00:20:16,975 --> 00:20:17,860
Scott: I looked at those slides.

307
00:20:18,061 --> 00:20:21,840
Scott: Yeah, if I was at that presentation, I'd go buy tomatoes and come back.

308
00:20:22,101 --> 00:20:24,532
Rym: You don't recruit and retain male engineers.

309
00:20:24,773 --> 00:20:27,845
Rym: you recruit and retain Wives and girlfriends.

310
00:20:28,146 --> 00:20:31,035
Rym: if the wife or girlfriend is unhappy the engineer is gone.

311
00:20:31,316 --> 00:20:32,700
Rym: the paycheck goes to her.

312
00:20:32,901 --> 00:20:35,340
Scott: You didn't let me finish about putting the rocks in the tomatoes.

313
00:20:39,282 --> 00:20:42,559
Rym: But like he even has his advice where's the thing that?

314
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:42,699
Rym: like?

315
00:20:43,582 --> 00:20:43,983
Rym: Here it is?

316
00:20:44,384 --> 00:20:46,549
Rym: be on the lookout for the I'm quoting this guy.

317
00:20:46,910 --> 00:21:02,100
Rym: be on the lookout for the holy grail the undiscovered Asperger's engineer and then what follows is literal advice on how to find someone with Asperger's syndrome And trick them into ruining their lives to make your company profitable.

318
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:02,782
Scott: Mm-hmm.

319
00:21:03,364 --> 00:21:07,537
Rym: This is literally what your jackass boss is thinking and trying to do.

320
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:13,640
Rym: Yep So I look forward to the continued just general disc.

321
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:20,391
Scott: These are the people who venture capitalists give lend money to instead of lending them to someone like me Because they'd rather have some asshole.

322
00:21:20,431 --> 00:21:22,160
Scott: have the money to make the world a shittier place.

323
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:26,540
Scott: Then have me go to the beach and make a better the world a better place by not bothering anybody.

324
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:34,815
Rym: yep, that's why I'm very very happy in some regards to the Decisions I've made in my life in terms of the places like the plate.

325
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:37,928
Rym: the last place I worked All my bonuses and everything were in lottery tickets.

326
00:21:37,948 --> 00:21:40,737
Rym: You know what that lottery did not come in but you know, that's a shock.

327
00:21:41,681 --> 00:21:46,120
Rym: But they paid me enough money to make rent in the meantime, and I only worked 40 hours a week.

328
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:49,240
Scott: Yeah, well this guy's doesn't sound like the guy in a guy who's gonna pay enough cash.

329
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,386
Scott: He's looks like he's a lottery tickets only.

330
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:53,693
Rym: Yeah, I get I get job offers.

331
00:21:53,713 --> 00:21:55,338
Scott: I actually read something interesting today.

332
00:21:55,378 --> 00:22:04,107
Scott: We're like There's some sort of like Wall Street is souring on certain companies like say Twitter who pay their employees with lots and lots of stock And not a lot of cash.

333
00:22:04,228 --> 00:22:09,035
Scott: Yeah, it's starting to cause some issues Like do you actually have any money to pay these employees?

334
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:10,060
Scott: Are they gonna let you know?

335
00:22:10,841 --> 00:22:17,760
Rym: Well, but so it's interesting because retention in those spaces is a big problem, but it's interesting in video games.

336
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:31,090
Rym: Retention is a problem because people get burned out and ruin their lives and just quit and disgust Eventually like after I hit a bottom like they hit rock bottom and someone tells them to quit and then they finally do because they're going Crazy, but I mean, it's a grasses

337
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:31,673
Scott: on ants.

338
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:33,500
Scott: It's a grass is always greener thing, right?

339
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:46,160
Scott: You're working at some job where you hate your co-workers But you have a life and you get and you know you get money and you look at this game job and maybe it pays more and you see all these cool co-workers because they're all Game people and you're like, oh man that what a better life that is.

340
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:52,306
Scott: Yeah you know you see the grass is greener you look at the things you don't have and you see that game job and it has The things you don't have now.

341
00:22:52,627 --> 00:22:55,700
Scott: so you move to it and you don't realize the parts that were worse.

342
00:22:55,881 --> 00:22:56,885
Rym: But see that's the difference.

343
00:22:56,925 --> 00:22:58,854
Scott: the guy that I have the priorities in order.

344
00:22:58,894 --> 00:23:00,340
Scott: Your life is number one priority.

345
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:05,176
Scott: The only reason that you are working is because you could need to work in order to live.

346
00:23:05,236 --> 00:23:10,231
Scott: if we had diamond age We wouldn't work But at least in other industries starch like we wouldn't work.

347
00:23:10,311 --> 00:23:11,938
Rym: finance and a lot of technology.

348
00:23:11,978 --> 00:23:15,991
Rym: the people Usually make a lot of money and while they're still ruining themselves.

349
00:23:16,272 --> 00:23:21,880
Rym: They at least have a giant salary the whole time But in games you don't even get that.

350
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:27,326
Rym: So if you're gonna burn yourself out and make these very poor decisions at least do it on Wall Street Because then at least you'll be making.

351
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,759
Scott: I know someone who works for Bloomberg, right?

352
00:23:30,241 --> 00:23:39,102
Scott: And they don't tell me how much money they make but they've told me how they make a lot of money and they're planning to retire very very early like 40s early I was looking at.

353
00:23:39,163 --> 00:23:42,033
Rym: so actually Bloomberg has a job posting that is literally.

354
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,840
Scott: Bloomberg pays really really well.

355
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,512
Scott: I know I know they actually and it's not like it's not.

356
00:23:47,773 --> 00:23:49,840
Scott: um, it's not like some miraculous culture.

357
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:54,080
Scott: That's like the best thing ever, but it's actually a pretty it's an okay culture over there, right?

358
00:23:54,120 --> 00:24:04,198
Rym: They don't make people work ridiculous And they have all sorts of luxuries in the bag repeatedly like whispered in my ear by people who are probably afraid that I would quit my current job.

359
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:06,650
Rym: how Boring and horrible it is to work at Bloomberg.

360
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:09,744
Rym: and I think they're afraid that I might just one day be like, you know What let's go work at Bloomberg.

361
00:24:10,326 --> 00:24:16,492
Scott: Yeah, I mean everything I know about it is like it's you could work at a lot worse places And you get paid a lot and you can retire early.

362
00:24:16,512 --> 00:24:17,839
Rym: So you got any news.

363
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,400
Scott: Yeah, so lately there's you know 360 video which is when you have a YouTube video where you can drag and look around.

364
00:24:24,641 --> 00:24:32,500
Scott: Right has been coming a lot hotter because there's a lot of cheap cameras Now that you can buy that are basically two wide-angle cameras back-to-back on a stick.

365
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:36,259
Rym: Yeah, the old days really like make a rig and then stitch it all.

366
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:40,359
Scott: now They've got like GoPros doing a thing where it's like four GoPros all together, right?

367
00:24:41,586 --> 00:24:45,407
Scott: I saw a guy the other day Biking and he had one of those.

368
00:24:45,447 --> 00:24:47,657
Rym: you had one of those who's biking around like fight.

369
00:24:47,677 --> 00:24:48,299
Scott: I yeah, why not?

370
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,980
Scott: So it's actually these things are getting cheaper and cheaper to get to make the 360 videos which are kind of fun.

371
00:24:54,061 --> 00:24:55,240
Scott: You can do cool things with them, right?

372
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,740
Scott: I saw a music video that was made with one where all the people in the music video were like standing around it.

373
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,420
Scott: So you could like look at the different band members, right?

374
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:09,100
Scott: Like look at the guitarist over here and then you turn around and look, you know And you can see what someone's doing when like they're not the center of attention, right?

375
00:25:09,561 --> 00:25:18,372
Scott: And then I've seen stuff for like, you know someone goes in a tour of a city and it's like you're on the tour bus and you can look around and that the different Sites on your own by clicking and dragging the mouse.

376
00:25:18,412 --> 00:25:22,268
Scott: So 360 a video is it's okay With VR doing head tracking it's even better.

377
00:25:22,328 --> 00:25:30,020
Scott: right because then you don't have you don't have to keep clicking and dragging and stuff Right, you can sort of naturally look about and that feels like you're in a place that you're not and that you know, that's cool.

378
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,959
Scott: But thing with 360 video is that until now?

379
00:25:34,841 --> 00:25:40,381
Scott: It's just been recorded, you know, and then you take all the cameras and combine the data after the fact and then upload it Right.

380
00:25:40,481 --> 00:25:40,743
Scott: Yep.

381
00:25:41,144 --> 00:25:47,346
Scott: YouTube is now adding a feature for the first ever I've ever seen Live-streaming 360 video.

382
00:25:47,386 --> 00:25:50,373
Rym: the example they show is already perfect because it's not just video.

383
00:25:50,493 --> 00:25:52,898
Rym: It also has the three-dimensional audio.

384
00:25:53,139 --> 00:25:53,339
Scott: Mm-hmm.

385
00:25:53,741 --> 00:26:09,518
Rym: So imagine like the example they show is there's a jazz concert live For a million people and every one of you every member of the audience is sitting on the middle of the stage Just with a band playing for them and you can just look around and hear all the audio.

386
00:26:09,618 --> 00:26:13,820
Scott: Yep, so Live-streaming 360 video it's like man.

387
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:20,180
Scott: I need some to subscribe to some channels and get some alerts of when people are going to be doing 360 live streams in various.

388
00:26:20,341 --> 00:26:26,420
Rym: Awesome guys, I want the NHL to put this rig in like the best seat at MSG.

389
00:26:27,204 --> 00:26:29,216
Scott: Dude, you could take the 360 cameras.

390
00:26:29,236 --> 00:26:29,940
Scott: They're so small.

391
00:26:30,181 --> 00:26:34,040
Scott: You could put a wide-angle lens on the front of someone's helmet and on the back of someone's home.

392
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:42,492
Scott: Oh, you could be lies lie during the game Be Somewhat like the quarterback or whoever at any sport, right?

393
00:26:42,512 --> 00:26:44,120
Rym: I just want to be in the crowd.

394
00:26:44,301 --> 00:26:49,380
Rym: I just want to be sitting in the best seat at MSG and you need to look behind you.

395
00:26:49,791 --> 00:26:52,010
Rym: Yeah I'll look behind me and see like whatever drunk I have.

396
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,116
Rym: you could take it just before.

397
00:26:53,136 --> 00:26:58,140
Scott: they could be like eight 360 cameras is like in the stands and you just pick which one you want to watch the game from.

398
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,833
Rym: Yeah couple that with an oculus or something.

399
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:01,960
Scott: It doesn't write in the stands.

400
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:03,760
Scott: You can look behind you and be like, oh who's fighting?

401
00:27:04,784 --> 00:27:09,540
Scott: If the drunk attacks the right make the home viewing experience the same as the stadium experience.

402
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:17,026
Scott: You could actually get rid of stands entirely one day and just play sports in much smaller spaces and just have 360 cameras like around the edge of the.

403
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:22,391
Rym: I've been thinking about this a lot and I've been talking to people who work in VR companies a lot.

404
00:27:22,754 --> 00:27:26,790
Rym: and the Spectation I got stuff we'll talk about on a Tuesday show.

405
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:32,797
Scott: right the 360 thing makes spectation a big deal at anything that's not you know, just forward-facing right?

406
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,045
Scott: think about like You know, I work for Broadway comm.

407
00:27:35,085 --> 00:27:43,986
Scott: there's a lot of Broadway shows where you're not just looking at the stage the whole time Right, you know like in cats the cats come out in the audience and in Phantom of the Opera They got the show Scott.

408
00:27:44,026 --> 00:27:45,799
Scott: Here's the one here comes over the top.

409
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:48,813
Rym: There's something you probably forgot about this but there's.

410
00:27:49,280 --> 00:28:09,660
Rym: Remember what we used to watch Penn and Teller's shows and stuff and all that like a long time ago and how they always talked About how the the best form of magic like the most amazing thing to see is the close-up magic Which is hard to get because the close-up magic is someone as good as like Penn Gillette Literally sitting in front of just you messing around and doing a trick in front of you.

411
00:28:10,384 --> 00:28:13,964
Rym: You could have people doing close-up magic to these rigs I mean, but I don't see.

412
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:17,399
Scott: you're how that really enhances it that much unless part of the magic trick is behind you.

413
00:28:18,162 --> 00:28:20,952
Rym: Well, it's not just looking out at you.

414
00:28:21,254 --> 00:28:24,944
Rym: It's that you've got this sphere of Your sort of present.

415
00:28:25,024 --> 00:28:28,777
Scott: use a wide-angle lens facing forward the whole point of the 360 camera.

416
00:28:28,797 --> 00:28:29,399
Scott: We already have 180 cameras.

417
00:28:29,861 --> 00:28:30,518
Scott: It's not a big deal.

418
00:28:30,741 --> 00:28:34,720
Scott: The whole point of the camera is that something behind you is going on, right?

419
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,750
Scott: There's a reason to look around if it's close-up magic.

420
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:40,619
Scott: You're only looking at this person right in front of you, right?

421
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:41,221
Scott: it's.

422
00:28:41,241 --> 00:28:41,866
Scott: I don't see how it's.

423
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:48,580
Rym: so you discount how Powerful the effect is if you move your head a little bit and the world moves correctly.

424
00:28:48,841 --> 00:28:55,509
Rym: yeah, like that effect is very profound in humans because of our Biology and how easily tricked our brains are.

425
00:28:55,589 --> 00:28:56,956
Scott: there needs to be things in all 360 degrees.

426
00:28:56,956 --> 00:29:00,340
Scott: 360 degree camera to be worthwhile.

427
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:01,605
Rym: I mean even this concert.

428
00:29:01,645 --> 00:29:03,092
Rym: what's gonna be directly behind you?

429
00:29:03,433 --> 00:29:05,060
Rym: some other jackass watching the concert?

430
00:29:05,363 --> 00:29:07,423
Scott: Well, that's what I'm saying, though But see how that's.

431
00:29:07,443 --> 00:29:09,251
Scott: the example is not a normal concert.

432
00:29:09,311 --> 00:29:11,440
Scott: how often in a concert are you in the middle of the bed with?

433
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,683
Scott: music coming from all sides Right.

434
00:29:13,804 --> 00:29:18,119
Scott: Imagine if every human being could like say shrink themselves to be really small.

435
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,907
Scott: What we wouldn't make a symphony on a stage.

436
00:29:20,947 --> 00:29:23,496
Scott: we would have a symphony surrounding you facing inwards.

437
00:29:23,576 --> 00:29:24,359
Scott: it would sound way better.

438
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,257
Rym: Arrangements would have to be changed a little bit.

439
00:29:28,298 --> 00:29:28,500
Rym: actually.

440
00:29:28,621 --> 00:29:31,040
Scott: I think you just have it, you know, it depends how many people you had, right?

441
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:43,560
Scott: It's like you'd have like one violin equally spread out in every direction or maybe like, you know Like you get like, you know how they have the in New York City in a lot of places like the whistling bench And the whistling arches and set it up like that.

442
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:50,738
Scott: So like even though the timpani is in the corner You can hear it on all the sides whistling basically effectively, you know, cuz you don't need four timpani's right?

443
00:29:50,758 --> 00:29:51,440
Scott: That's a little ridiculous.

444
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,509
Scott: Like oh fuck me.

445
00:29:55,254 --> 00:29:56,160
Scott: I can't hear anything else.

446
00:29:56,882 --> 00:30:07,130
Rym: Things of the day.

447
00:30:07,474 --> 00:30:13,409
Rym: So if you didn't know Pyongyang in North Korea a place you should not go ever don't go there.

448
00:30:13,932 --> 00:30:21,230
Scott: Maybe one day you can go there like you can go to Cuba now It has a subway right but do not go there until I say you can go there.

449
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,380
Scott: That's because by the time I say you can go there.

450
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,650
Scott: It'll definitely be safe to go there.

451
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:35,098
Scott: So only recently were foreigners ever allowed inside Pyongyang subway except like one station The shiny the shiny one that looked good and had actors in it.

452
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:39,710
Rym: So this is a photo journal with a lot of pictures.

453
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:47,456
Rym: This is basically the first group of foreigners who have ever been allowed to see the entirety of the Pyongyang metro system Every stage.

454
00:30:47,476 --> 00:30:48,424
Scott: people actually use it.

455
00:30:48,464 --> 00:30:49,169
Scott: or is it just for show?

456
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,501
Rym: I think people actually use it.

457
00:30:50,521 --> 00:30:51,370
Rym: but remember the people in King.

458
00:30:51,571 --> 00:30:57,030
Scott: I remember hearing it was just for show and that like they saw people like oh no That was I think was the regular train station.

459
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:00,710
Scott: They got off the train because they came in the train from China or Russia or whatever.

460
00:31:01,011 --> 00:31:10,390
Scott: Yeah, and then when they got off at the train station, there are people about the train station But there weren't any trains other leaving or arriving other than the one that they had just arrived on.

461
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:13,062
Scott: so there were no reason for any people to be in that train station.

462
00:31:13,102 --> 00:31:13,202
Scott: that.

463
00:31:13,222 --> 00:31:21,930
Rym: but when Yang is sort of like the Propaganda city so it like people live there the privileged few or I guess the most trusted or best-looking or whatever.

464
00:31:22,191 --> 00:31:24,558
Scott: I'm sure their lives are not great when there's no foreigners around.

465
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:30,541
Rym: but this is a lot of photos and they're Fascinating just from all the subway stations.

466
00:31:31,164 --> 00:31:35,230
Scott: It looks like every other photos I've seen in North Korea before but these you've never seen inside of here.

467
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:38,370
Scott: I haven't seen those particular ones, but they the propaganda looks the same.

468
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:41,230
Rym: It's all the most interesting notes about this.

469
00:31:41,832 --> 00:31:47,710
Rym: Later works their trains work one the trains themselves look straight out of like East Germany.

470
00:31:48,252 --> 00:31:50,319
Scott: Yeah, like Cold War it takes Dracula.

471
00:31:50,379 --> 00:31:53,229
Scott: It's a lot harder for him to get around those trains.

472
00:31:54,092 --> 00:32:06,410
Rym: And two in almost every photo there's at least one if not multiple people Given the photographer the fucking death stare like people are not happy that this person is there.

473
00:32:06,732 --> 00:32:09,510
Rym: It is side-eye after side-eye after side-eye.

474
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,246
Scott: Maybe it's just because they have to act while that person's there and they can't.

475
00:32:12,709 --> 00:32:13,332
Rym: well I press.

476
00:32:13,412 --> 00:32:25,750
Rym: I posited another idea that if you live in North Korea You are told your entire life that foreigners particularly Americans are the reason your lives are filled with such terror and privation.

477
00:32:25,831 --> 00:32:28,270
Scott: And why are they allowed in your country?

478
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:30,354
Scott: so you just murder them on site.

479
00:32:30,534 --> 00:32:37,539
Rym: you see one being escorted around by North Korean security forces for whatever reason and It'd be like if

480
00:32:37,843 --> 00:32:46,650
Scott: I don't know today If I saw someone being escorted around the city by the security forces usually the security force is in the city You're just sort of standing there, you know doing their jobs doing nothing.

481
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:51,870
Scott: Yeah, if I saw them escorting someone I'd probably rubberneck a bit and be like, oh who did they arrest him?

482
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:52,855
Scott: For what reason it's got?

483
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:55,389
Rym: what if a bunch of people who just looked like Nazi Hitler's.

484
00:32:55,791 --> 00:33:02,522
Rym: We're walking around taking photos in the subway suddenly and there's a bunch of cops Just like walking them around and guiding them and no other context.

485
00:33:02,562 --> 00:33:06,469
Scott: I'd assume that the cops are keeping me from killing them Which is probably correct.

486
00:33:06,972 --> 00:33:08,297
Rym: This is a fact in fact.

487
00:33:08,317 --> 00:33:16,710
Scott: that happens in the United States like when the KKK people like, you know Get a. you know a thing like a license to have like a rally or something, Illinois Nazis, right?

488
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:21,428
Scott: The cops have to be there no matter how much they hate him - you know because they got to protect them from.

489
00:33:21,448 --> 00:33:22,653
Scott: you know The smart people.

490
00:33:23,337 --> 00:33:23,980
Scott: that's how it goes.

491
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,750
Scott: You know, it's the cops aren't approving of them.

492
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,515
Scott: It's just if you have your protest.

493
00:33:27,556 --> 00:33:30,184
Scott: that's anti KKK and the KKK protest.

494
00:33:30,224 --> 00:33:31,648
Scott: the cops will protect you from them.

495
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:34,722
Rym: Also So I got you got a thing of the day.

496
00:33:34,742 --> 00:33:36,108
Scott: I do have a thing of the day.

497
00:33:36,169 --> 00:33:41,570
Scott: so There was that new Godzilla movie that came out in the US a while ago year or two ago.

498
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:46,679
Scott: It's been a while actually, but the new Godzilla movie is directed by He deiaki.

499
00:33:46,861 --> 00:33:47,810
Scott: I know don't?

500
00:33:49,098 --> 00:33:51,738
Rym: I saw Twitter Flipping out about that trailer.

501
00:33:51,758 --> 00:33:52,702
Scott: Did you watch the trailer?

502
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:53,385
Rym: I did not.

503
00:33:53,526 --> 00:33:54,510
Scott: well, that's my thing of the day.

504
00:33:54,571 --> 00:33:55,479
Scott: So we're gonna watch it now.

505
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:02,730
Scott: So this trailer Basically, I watched the trailer and I said wow You didn't even need to tell me this is directed by Anno.

506
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:16,170
Scott: In fact, I didn't know until after watching the trailer and I noticed while I was watching the trailer Like there's a scene in the beginning where some glass shatters and when the glass shattered I'm like that really looks like a building falling apart and say Akira or even jelly.

507
00:34:16,873 --> 00:34:30,387
Scott: That particular way they animate the buildings smashing but done in live-action Right, and then there was a scene where the tail there's a lot of tail action Right where the tail goes over these Japanese buildings in the street and the camera pans across the right.

508
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:35,550
Scott: and I was like That really seemed like you know that what which angel had like the whippy arms?

509
00:34:35,733 --> 00:34:45,170
Scott: Oh, yeah And I'm like it really feels like that scene like I feel like I've seen this shot before That's and then when I saw Godzilla, it was a really scary Godzilla, right?

510
00:34:45,429 --> 00:35:01,346
Scott: But he's got those t-rex arms and they were extra t-rex arms like yeah And I was like that reminds me of when I watched how we hono and the person who was the actor who was playing on Oh was doing a Godzilla impression and had that exact same body language.

511
00:35:01,387 --> 00:35:02,290
Rym: I gotta finish that show.

512
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:02,551
Rym: I

513
00:35:02,611 --> 00:35:14,310
Scott: wonder if that person saw I know doing a Godzilla impression and stole that body language for his acting and I know also put his own body like his idea of how Godzilla's

514
00:35:15,471 --> 00:35:17,797
Rym: Blue blazes and think it was funny and then

515
00:35:17,958 --> 00:35:23,356
Scott: I don't know but it was definitely the same body language in both blue blazes and This Godzilla

516
00:35:23,396 --> 00:35:23,718
Rym: or Scott.

517
00:35:23,738 --> 00:35:24,241
Rym: is it possible?

518
00:35:24,261 --> 00:35:26,312
Rym: That's just Godzilla's body language I think.

519
00:35:27,054 --> 00:35:31,889
Scott: I think that you know that Godzilla's body language is that but it's like it's.

520
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:35,109
Scott: Has it has like this flavor right the seasoning of it?

521
00:35:35,671 --> 00:35:41,530
Scott: The raw material is still beef but the seasoning is definitely the seasoning of the crazy guy.

522
00:35:42,072 --> 00:35:46,250
Scott: So I'm gonna see this shit as soon as it gets English subtitles good or awful.

523
00:35:47,231 --> 00:35:50,824
Rym: So in the minute the booklet book will be Margaret Edward Oryx and Craig.

524
00:35:51,406 --> 00:35:52,350
Rym: I'm biking to work every day.

525
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,461
Rym: So god, I don't want to read anything anymore.

526
00:35:54,481 --> 00:35:55,487
Scott: I'm about to start it.

527
00:35:55,809 --> 00:35:56,854
Rym: Yep I'm pretty much done with.

528
00:35:56,894 --> 00:35:59,829
Scott: that was only like there's only like one manga sitting on top of it.

529
00:36:00,933 --> 00:36:03,370
Rym: I learned a lot of stuff about Randell tour and stuff happened.

530
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:06,741
Rym: So I'll move on to another book for a while and let that said good.

531
00:36:06,902 --> 00:36:09,450
Rym: We're going to be at PAX East this weekend.

532
00:36:09,671 --> 00:36:11,636
Scott: Yeah, so don't expect a show Wednesday.

533
00:36:11,656 --> 00:36:12,659
Rym: No show Wednesday.

00:36:16,471 --> 00:36:17,538
Scott: I'm coming on the bus back.

537
00:36:17,638 --> 00:36:19,570
Scott: I'm gonna be working in the tabletop night shift.

538
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:22,060
Scott: So that is the time to come and play some games.

539
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:26,079
Scott: when I'm not there to play games with you and beat you I will On the night you want to lose it games.

540
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:27,850
Scott: feel free to play games at any other hour.

541
00:36:28,351 --> 00:36:31,200
Scott: If you want to win the games play at night when I can't play with you.

542
00:36:31,842 --> 00:36:34,510
Rym: I will be working the VR lounge.

543
00:36:34,794 --> 00:36:35,850
Scott: That's a shame.

544
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:39,116
Scott: That's gonna be handheld lounge.

545
00:36:39,136 --> 00:36:40,841
Rym: It's the weird Department.

546
00:36:40,901 --> 00:36:43,709
Scott: It's handheld lounge - I think I'm trying to do the circuit.

547
00:36:43,749 --> 00:36:47,136
Rym: my goal Is to do everything.

548
00:36:47,176 --> 00:36:49,402
Scott: I mean, that's your excuse now.

549
00:36:49,763 --> 00:36:51,969
Rym: Yeah, I've got every I've always got every year.

550
00:36:52,351 --> 00:36:56,008
Scott: It's the way to make yourself feel good about working in a shit department every year in the forum.

551
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:59,943
Scott: regret Not just being tabletop all the time like smart people seems like more work than other.

552
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:00,927
Scott: table top is great.

553
00:37:00,947 --> 00:37:01,610
Scott: It's the best department.

554
00:37:02,132 --> 00:37:03,095
Rym: Main events is real fun.

555
00:37:03,376 --> 00:37:04,962
Rym: live streaming was fun before.

556
00:37:05,103 --> 00:37:11,770
Rym: I didn't get to sit in the room anymore back when I got to be Pax 2 on the video all the time, but when you go to Pax if you're not working, where do you spend most of your time?

557
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,075
Rym: Playing games in tabletop.

558
00:37:14,095 --> 00:37:15,600
Scott: So what's the difference?

559
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:18,028
Rym: not playing games and walking around being a presence?

560
00:37:18,048 --> 00:37:20,250
Scott: sure Being a presence is good.

561
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:26,718
Scott: You can tell people how to wit you see go up to someone and they're playing Carcassonne and they're about to put the towel In a real dumbass place and you're like, whoa.

562
00:37:26,819 --> 00:37:28,145
Scott: Well, what the fuck you do right there.

563
00:37:28,506 --> 00:37:29,330
Scott: put it over there.

564
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,895
Scott: Don't let him finish that Cathedral.

565
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,182
Scott: You gotta aim a road right at the heart.

566
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,627
Rym: on Sunday 3 30 p.m.

567
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,294
Rym: Arachnid theater.

568
00:37:36,314 --> 00:37:38,384
Rym: We were doing Atari game design.

569
00:37:38,505 --> 00:37:39,309
Scott: We've done it before me.

570
00:37:39,952 --> 00:37:42,785
Rym: I think thing is we've never put it on YouTube so you can't see it.

571
00:37:42,866 --> 00:37:43,790
Scott: Why didn't you put on YouTube?

572
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:44,774
Scott: You record it like twice.

573
00:37:45,075 --> 00:37:46,301
Rym: Yeah, I'm gonna do it again.

574
00:37:46,321 --> 00:37:46,984
Rym: Maybe we'll see.

575
00:37:47,004 --> 00:37:50,760
Scott: we didn't do good enough the other times We did except the Atari video.

576
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,905
Rym: We didn't record the Atari video.

577
00:37:51,925 --> 00:37:53,130
Rym: We didn't actually video anything.

578
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,720
Scott: I thought you were doing that with some ODB now DB.

579
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,706
Rym: Yeah OBS, but the second time we didn't even record it ODB should retire.

580
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:03,815
Scott: Pretty sure he's dead.

581
00:38:04,217 --> 00:38:05,863
Rym: So Pax is gonna be awesome.

582
00:38:05,923 --> 00:38:06,566
Rym: We're gonna be there.

583
00:38:06,686 --> 00:38:07,570
Rym: We'll see you in Boston.

584
00:38:07,871 --> 00:38:11,026
Rym: Yeah, also on the patreon I did put up.

585
00:38:11,066 --> 00:38:11,770
Rym: we hit that goal.

586
00:38:12,191 --> 00:38:20,942
Rym: so the first episode of GeekNights ever the beta with commentary remastered is in the patreon for the backers, but publicly for anyone to listen to.

587
00:38:21,284 --> 00:38:26,707
Rym: I put just the Commentary because I listened to the whole episode and I did about 16 minutes worth of commentary.

588
00:38:27,089 --> 00:38:29,150
Rym: and Scott I said there's something in the commentary.

589
00:38:30,992 --> 00:38:34,050
Rym: We recorded a bunch of stuff before the first beta episode.

590
00:38:34,592 --> 00:38:47,570
Rym: I don't remember this to you know because in the episode at one point We say something like well We like, you know, we listen to what we recorded yesterday and blah blah blah.

591
00:38:48,071 --> 00:38:53,750
Rym: But I'm literally listening to the first audio file we ever made as far as I can remember must have lost one.

592
00:38:54,831 --> 00:39:00,150
Rym: I get the impression we recorded a bunch of stuff in the alpha and maybe we just agreed to delete it.

593
00:39:00,311 --> 00:39:01,058
Rym: Like I don't remember.

594
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:01,483
Rym: I just wondered.

595
00:39:01,503 --> 00:39:02,190
Rym: you remembered that.

596
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:02,492
Scott: I don't know.

597
00:39:02,552 --> 00:39:05,410
Scott: I went to go to my backups recently to find some software.

598
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,156
Scott: I wrote in college and I found everything.

599
00:39:07,577 --> 00:39:09,985
Scott: and so if your backups are not as good as mine.

600
00:39:10,005 --> 00:39:11,350
Scott: That's not my problem.

601
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:15,122
Rym: 2005 it was October 11th is the first GeekNights.

602
00:39:15,142 --> 00:39:16,608
Scott: You're the one who backed up all these things.

603
00:39:16,648 --> 00:39:16,930
Scott: Not me.

604
00:39:17,231 --> 00:39:20,624
Rym: Yeah, no, I'm saying but we called it the beta.

605
00:39:20,704 --> 00:39:22,793
Scott: also since I'm not paying for the patreon I don't have these.

606
00:39:23,256 --> 00:39:24,321
Scott: I can't get the files.

607
00:39:24,482 --> 00:39:25,145
Scott: You can listen to them.

608
00:39:25,206 --> 00:39:25,849
Rym: You can listen to them.

609
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:26,915
Scott: I'm not paying you any money.

610
00:39:27,016 --> 00:39:27,861
Rym: No, you can leave.

611
00:39:27,901 --> 00:39:28,545
Rym: got the backup.

612
00:39:28,565 --> 00:39:29,470
Rym: You could just listen to the file.

613
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,795
Rym: You even know the fucking URL.

614
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:33,446
Scott: I thought y'all I thought you found one that was even older.

615
00:39:33,467 --> 00:39:34,250
Scott: that wasn't at the URL.

616
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:35,655
Rym: Oh, yeah, I can give you that one.

617
00:39:35,675 --> 00:39:37,100
Rym: Okay, then you just don't get.

618
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,606
Rym: let's do a remastered unless you pay.

619
00:39:38,866 --> 00:39:40,537
Scott: Oh, no remaster It took me a while.

620
00:39:40,558 --> 00:39:41,690
Rym: It was hard to remaster that shit.

621
00:39:41,971 --> 00:39:46,266
Rym: It was actually really hard to remaster that shit and let me tell you smells like ramen.

622
00:39:46,929 --> 00:39:55,618
Rym: I am Really pleased with how well I was able to remaster that audio because if you hear what it sounded like originally It is almost unlistenable.

623
00:39:55,658 --> 00:39:56,441
Scott: Does it smell like ramen?

624
00:39:56,722 --> 00:39:57,746
Rym: Yeah, Emily's cooking in there.

625
00:39:57,866 --> 00:39:58,328
Scott: Is it ramen?

626
00:39:58,448 --> 00:39:59,353
Rym: I don't know It's food.

627
00:39:59,635 --> 00:40:00,701
Scott: It smells like some food cooking.

628
00:40:01,064 --> 00:40:09,869
Rym: Anyway, anyway So there's been a lot of stories about ransomware or crypto where lately to the point that I feel like we should at least explain A little bit about what the deal is there.

629
00:40:10,071 --> 00:40:11,417
Scott: Well, I mean, this is something that just sort of.

630
00:40:11,437 --> 00:40:16,100
Scott: this is one of those things that escaped being a show topic because it's just So common and so sort of like.

631
00:40:16,663 --> 00:40:17,930
Scott: it's never like spikes, right?

632
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:18,512
Scott: It's always just like.

633
00:40:18,532 --> 00:40:22,930
Scott: there's always one once in a while and you tend to just sort of it just like a fact of life.

634
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:28,390
Rym: Well, it also wasn't that common until the last few years like so if you took definitely been happening more.

635
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:31,270
Scott: But it never happens like a whole bunch in a very short period of time.

636
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:37,484
Rym: It's also one of those things where we always said years and years ago Why doesn't someone just do this with a virus like why don't you make some money?

637
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:44,430
Scott: Someone is yeah Viruses in the old day were harmless pranks and fun or some of them would just like destroy your computer.

638
00:40:44,811 --> 00:40:53,317
Rym: But then they then they got to the point where people make viruses that would like literally just like ruin all your data delete random Files like literally destroy your life.

639
00:40:53,759 --> 00:41:03,950
Scott: and then we got to the stage where viruses and malware wouldn't actually do any that they would Monitor you you borrow your CPU cycle send spam with your computer do all sorts of other things.

640
00:41:04,853 --> 00:41:12,143
Scott: That would basically just make money and let your computer keep running and hope you keep using your computer Because as long as your computer keeps working you keep it turned on.

641
00:41:12,384 --> 00:41:16,502
Scott: they make more money by using it Maybe in like a zombie army to do SPL or who knows what.

642
00:41:16,562 --> 00:41:23,523
Rym: now what's interesting is even in that era Very rarely did they try to steal like credit card numbers or things like they.

643
00:41:23,644 --> 00:41:25,830
Rym: just they did like spam bots or whatever.

644
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:31,250
Rym: And then we entered the air after that where most malware was literally just trying to steal your credit card number.

645
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:37,411
Scott: Yeah, I know your bank account number and now credit card numbers aren't even worth a lot of money on like the evil black market Right.

646
00:41:37,431 --> 00:41:39,230
Scott: Yeah, it's like you can just buy credit cards.

647
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:43,808
Scott: It's a. you know passports physical ones are worth a lot of money, but that's hard to steal with its software.

648
00:41:44,109 --> 00:41:51,110
Rym: So Ransomware, I think part of the reason it had a big up-and-coming like the reason we're seeing it is the best way to make money.

649
00:41:51,632 --> 00:41:55,890
Rym: It's only a way to make money because bitcoins are still worth some amount of money.

650
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:56,613
Scott: That's true.

651
00:41:56,815 --> 00:42:03,406
Rym: if you wanted to make a ransomware before Bitcoin Mmm, someone's got to send you the money somehow and that's tough to do.

652
00:42:03,426 --> 00:42:04,309
Rym: Yeah, what are you gonna do?

653
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:05,553
Scott: We're gonna be like yourself.

654
00:42:05,894 --> 00:42:06,838
Scott: You're gonna do the old.

655
00:42:07,018 --> 00:42:10,230
Scott: are you gonna do old suitcase briefcase of money next to the trashcan thing?

656
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:13,280
Rym: Yep, mail the mail cash to this p.o box.

657
00:42:13,341 --> 00:42:14,204
Rym: Like you're gonna get caught.

658
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:14,947
Scott: good luck with that.

659
00:42:14,967 --> 00:42:16,392
Rym: It's a lot of work You might cause.

660
00:42:16,412 --> 00:42:24,935
Scott: no point allows you to hold people's stuff for ransom and then get money from them in the form of bitcoins Without the police finding you.

661
00:42:25,237 --> 00:42:29,899
Rym: so the most basic ransomware and then we'll talk about cuz Scott was like How could you get gotten by this if you're not dumb?

662
00:42:29,919 --> 00:42:31,468
Rym: and the answer is you really can't.

663
00:42:31,568 --> 00:42:42,237
Rym: yeah but there are ways to make ransomware dangerous even to relatively smart and sophisticated people and we're seeing it get really Sophisticated in a hurry.

664
00:42:42,739 --> 00:42:51,370
Scott: So basic ransomware is as such you get some sort of virus Because you did something stupid like a download an email attachment or you went to a shady website and clicked on something shady.

665
00:42:51,511 --> 00:42:53,685
Scott: No, it's already exe from download.

666
00:42:53,726 --> 00:43:00,450
Rym: calm now It is possible to get these things through, you know a zero-day exploit where there's nothing you could do, right?

667
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:04,312
Scott: That would be but still is zero to exploit wouldn't be on google.com It would be.

668
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:08,590
Scott: you went in your your unpatched browser right on or on the zero day.

669
00:43:08,651 --> 00:43:17,014
Scott: There is no patch yet But you visited a shady ass website except running the zero day like some legit websites have hosted this through their ad networks You can also run.

670
00:43:17,034 --> 00:43:18,864
Scott: you didn't have ad blocker, right?

671
00:43:18,904 --> 00:43:26,690
Rym: It's a dumb person but What they do is they get on your computer and then what they take all your files and start encrypting them.

672
00:43:26,952 --> 00:43:28,330
Rym: They have a little private key locally.

673
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:33,330
Scott: Yeah, if they run something that's basically just like true crypt the thing that you would normally use to encrypt your hard drive.

674
00:43:33,713 --> 00:43:35,509
Scott: But they just start encrypting your drive.

675
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:40,450
Scott: So they look like my document like everything still works because when you double click on a file it decrypts it.

676
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:51,737
Scott: You might not notice it is slower, but you might not notice how it being slower because your computer is pretty fast Yeah, and then once it's encrypted It pops up the screen and it's like alright, dude I encrypted all your shit.

677
00:43:52,199 --> 00:44:00,691
Rym: send, you know one Bitcoin to this address Within 48 hours or I'm deleting the private key and your data is literally unrecoverable Mm-hmm.

678
00:44:01,233 --> 00:44:04,645
Scott: See if they just deleted all your stuff it would you would first of all, you'd notice immediately.

679
00:44:04,665 --> 00:44:07,275
Scott: and second of all How could they ransom you like?

680
00:44:07,316 --> 00:44:08,360
Scott: Oh, we'll give you your data back.

681
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,264
Scott: It's like it's already gone.

682
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:11,287
Scott: But by encrypting all of it It's like aha.

683
00:44:11,752 --> 00:44:19,685
Scott: We have basically taken your data hostage and now you must pay us into Unencrypted because to pot if you find the key after we delete the key.

684
00:44:20,107 --> 00:44:20,770
Scott: Good luck with that.

685
00:44:20,872 --> 00:44:20,937
Scott: Yep.

686
00:44:21,311 --> 00:44:29,498
Rym: Now if it's well written because there's been a few instances recently where smart people who are doing you know Basically doing white hat hacking right?

687
00:44:29,538 --> 00:44:32,070
Scott: You could just first of all if they use that method, right?

688
00:44:32,311 --> 00:44:33,659
Scott: They haven't deleted the key yet.

689
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,509
Scott: You could unplug the computer real fast.

690
00:44:35,831 --> 00:44:42,458
Scott: Take the drive out, you know connect to the drive find the key that's on there somewhere And then use it to decrypt your stuff.

691
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:42,880
Scott: Now.

692
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,130
Rym: What if the key itself is encrypted?

693
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:46,676
Scott: It's right, but it's still.

694
00:44:46,716 --> 00:44:47,339
Scott: it's easier.

695
00:44:47,379 --> 00:44:50,493
Scott: The key would be encrypted with something like AES Right.

696
00:44:50,513 --> 00:44:53,129
Scott: So that's it's a symmetric key and not a public-private key.

697
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:54,659
Scott: Yeah, because they even know it.

698
00:44:54,840 --> 00:45:06,170
Scott: even though it's very difficult to crack It won't be impossible and most likely I can't imagine it being such a complicated, you know You would be able to eventually rescue your if your data was important enough to decrypt.

699
00:45:06,632 --> 00:45:08,763
Scott: You would you would do it and if it wasn't important enough.

700
00:45:08,803 --> 00:45:14,352
Rym: you who cares right now It may I mean not talking about us But a general like.

701
00:45:14,372 --> 00:45:21,235
Rym: think about a normal person using their computer and suddenly it's like hey dog all your files What do you do?

702
00:45:21,938 --> 00:45:23,767
Scott: You don't even know how to get a Bitcoin and send it.

703
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:24,310
Scott: So you're fucked.

704
00:45:24,531 --> 00:45:30,910
Rym: Yeah, so actually these ransomware's usually provide very clear instructions on how to buy bitcoins where to buy them.

705
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:35,069
Rym: They provide helpful links documentation Some of them have helps and facts.

706
00:45:35,512 --> 00:45:48,242
Scott: I mean you could really if you've infected the person's computer this much you could really just Like do everything automatically for them and just be like enter credit card info here to buy the Bitcoin Yep, and then they click OK and then here's it can be alright.

707
00:45:48,302 --> 00:45:50,410
Scott: and then I'd be like, oh, thanks for your credit card info.

708
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:52,339
Scott: No, I'm just buy all the bitcoins I want with it.

709
00:45:52,661 --> 00:45:54,650
Rym: I would make one where once you give the Bitcoin to be like.

710
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:58,402
Scott: Yeah, just kidding ten more bitcoins I would be like you'd have to type.

711
00:45:58,483 --> 00:46:04,169
Scott: I'd be just like, you know You type the credit card in now just buy coins up to your credit card limit and give them to myself the end

712
00:46:04,832 --> 00:46:06,218
Rym: And then not even decrypt the guys and

713
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:08,790
Scott: then sell your credit card number to somebody to to make an extra buck.

714
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:17,710
Scott: But these are highly effective and if you put stop if you stop the payment, then I'll remove the re-encrypt your computer.

715
00:46:18,512 --> 00:46:25,858
Rym: But they're highly effective if you don't have proper backups and why I say backups not Redundancy because you have a raid.

716
00:46:26,179 --> 00:46:26,882
Rym: these things are.

717
00:46:26,902 --> 00:46:29,475
Scott: we did a show about this a long time ago So you can go listen to that.

718
00:46:29,535 --> 00:46:32,170
Scott: We're talking about the different levels of backing up, right?

719
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:33,114
Scott: And it's nothing.

720
00:46:33,194 --> 00:46:36,610
Scott: no information in that show despite it being really old has really changed, right?

721
00:46:37,032 --> 00:46:45,166
Scott: If you have your data backed up like if someone gave me ransomware on my computer today and was like We're gonna be encrypted all the hard drives in my computer and there's a lot of them.

722
00:46:45,527 --> 00:46:47,172
Scott: I'd be like Okay.

723
00:46:47,553 --> 00:46:48,716
Scott: So what are you gonna do?

724
00:46:49,077 --> 00:46:51,063
Scott: Oh, no, there's a bunch of games.

725
00:46:51,204 --> 00:46:51,745
Scott: I installed.

726
00:46:51,786 --> 00:46:53,190
Scott: I can't get those from Steam again.

727
00:46:53,933 --> 00:46:55,160
Scott: Oh, there's a bunch of other apps.

728
00:46:55,381 --> 00:46:56,044
Scott: Okay, what?

729
00:46:56,145 --> 00:46:57,150
Scott: what file is on there?

730
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:57,692
Scott: They can't give it.

731
00:46:57,752 --> 00:47:02,230
Scott: all the things that I've backed up are backed up in like two different cloud services and my NAS.

732
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:05,102
Scott: Even if they could access my NAS and encrypted.

733
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:08,154
Scott: that is like, okay, I've got it in the cloud still You can't access that.

734
00:47:08,174 --> 00:47:10,321
Rym: If your NAS is mounted they can and they will.

735
00:47:10,402 --> 00:47:12,590
Rym: actually they'll mount every file system and encrypt it.

736
00:47:12,771 --> 00:47:13,576
Scott: Sure, go for it.

737
00:47:13,656 --> 00:47:13,858
Scott: Okay.

738
00:47:13,918 --> 00:47:14,924
Scott: I got my cloud backup.

739
00:47:14,944 --> 00:47:15,589
Scott: You can't get there.

740
00:47:15,629 --> 00:47:20,026
Rym: Yep I literally dragged my entire two terabyte NAS up to Amazon cloud drive every month.

741
00:47:20,227 --> 00:47:20,910
Scott: I got the whole thing.

742
00:47:21,051 --> 00:47:22,076
Rym: I just do a snapshot of it.

743
00:47:22,317 --> 00:47:23,664
Scott: It's like, you know, you can't right?

744
00:47:23,704 --> 00:47:27,149
Scott: so then if someone did this to me I'm like, alright, it'd be a pain in the ass, but it won't be a big deal.

745
00:47:27,792 --> 00:47:40,149
Rym: But so even if it got me in the middle of a workflow like say I have 40 gigabytes of video from Scott on an SD card and I've copied it to my local hard drive And we haven't uploaded it to the cloud yet.

746
00:47:40,371 --> 00:47:45,510
Rym: Yeah, or like I just started uploading it to the cloud drive, but the ransomware has infected me already.

747
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:46,857
Scott: I'm holding the SD card.

748
00:47:46,877 --> 00:47:51,340
Scott: I guess the ransomware could get the SD card walls If the SD card is still plugged in.

749
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,067
Scott: Oh, no, we lost a panel video.

750
00:47:53,107 --> 00:47:53,790
Scott: the end of the world.

751
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:59,150
Rym: It's totally worth a Bitcoin not so then it comes down to what are you willing to pay for that data?

752
00:47:59,991 --> 00:48:02,703
Scott: Or I'm willing to pay a dollar for this panel video.

753
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:03,546
Scott: It depends.

754
00:48:03,566 --> 00:48:07,025
Rym: if it was a good panel I'd be willing to pay up to like 50 bucks.

755
00:48:07,126 --> 00:48:07,750
Scott: That's all you.

756
00:48:08,951 --> 00:48:11,021
Rym: One zero, but think about so.

757
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:19,190
Scott: it's other thing is that it's you know Paying terrorists is not a good strategy because that encourages them to continue if they if no one's getting paid off of it.

758
00:48:19,873 --> 00:48:26,402
Rym: But that's why these ransomware is tend to ask for a Significant amount of money but not a huge amount of money.

759
00:48:26,422 --> 00:48:28,530
Rym: They never asked for like hundreds thousands of dollars.

760
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,593
Rym: They're always like 50 bucks hundred bucks.

761
00:48:31,094 --> 00:48:38,258
Rym: Yep, you're gonna risk like every photo you have of your kid for a hundred bucks Mmm, so fuck up.

762
00:48:39,021 --> 00:48:41,130
Rym: I mean what's very interesting?

763
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:46,929
Rym: Is that this ransomware has started to get a little more widespread and that they're starting to get into?

764
00:48:47,452 --> 00:48:48,658
Rym: Enterprise environment.

765
00:48:48,718 --> 00:48:51,090
Scott: so it may forget shouldn't the enterprise environment have backups?

766
00:48:51,691 --> 00:48:58,849
Rym: Yeah, but if the backup is mounted or mounted by accessible from the computer it'll encrypt that too.

767
00:48:59,873 --> 00:49:08,409
Scott: I mean usually even if you have a shared drive that everyone has mounted that's usually backed up somewhere else Right up to the cloud or to another storage machine or something.

768
00:49:08,831 --> 00:49:12,281
Rym: So I guess I haven't seen an example of this yet.

769
00:49:12,301 --> 00:49:12,382
Rym: Now.

770
00:49:12,402 --> 00:49:13,786
Rym: I've seen some pretty sophisticated one.

771
00:49:13,826 --> 00:49:19,270
Rym: So a lot of these to Force you to be able to basically to force you to just pay.

772
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:24,309
Rym: They will give you like a one-hour countdown like yo, you've got an hour.

773
00:49:25,116 --> 00:49:26,609
Rym: You're not sure what we've encrypted.

774
00:49:27,711 --> 00:49:28,976
Rym: You've got an hour to pay the Bitcoin.

775
00:49:29,016 --> 00:49:33,050
Rym: or we delete the key like that kind of thing like literally counting down in front of you.

776
00:49:33,855 --> 00:49:34,741
Rym: Some of them will do that.

777
00:49:34,822 --> 00:49:35,970
Scott: I'll just unplug the computer.

778
00:49:36,931 --> 00:49:44,030
Rym: So if you unplug the computer, maybe they've already deleted the key, but the key was transmitted to the overseas server.

779
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:47,407
Rym: They won't send you a copy of it unless good for them.

780
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:50,664
Rym: Good move Yeah, so you could make this stuff really sophisticated.

781
00:49:50,685 --> 00:49:52,595
Rym: if you want to be really clever You'd have to.

782
00:49:52,616 --> 00:49:59,444
Rym: I mean you could probably make one that would Encrypt all the files and keep encrypting all the backups you're taking.

783
00:49:59,565 --> 00:50:01,070
Rym: if it had a way to do that, right?

784
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:14,410
Scott: That's the thing is if you take backups You know frequently right enough if the ransomware is dormantly encrypting things for a long enough time eventually your oldest backup Right, eventually all your backups are encrypted too and you don't realize it now.

785
00:50:15,191 --> 00:50:19,183
Scott: That would which is why you need to test your backups and make sure they work.

786
00:50:19,624 --> 00:50:23,378
Rym: Yep, and almost no one does that Nope, and when I did that.

787
00:50:23,398 --> 00:50:25,287
Rym: I do that at my previous company.

788
00:50:25,307 --> 00:50:31,497
Rym: when we did that We'd find a bad backup every now and then which was good because if we never found a bad backup I'd be worried that we weren't actually testing

789
00:50:31,517 --> 00:50:37,487
Scott: the thing that does our database backups also Not only does it MySQL dump but also loads them into a database to make sure they work.

790
00:50:37,729 --> 00:50:44,906
Rym: Yep But the ransomware is I think going to explode on the scene increasingly because it is actually.

791
00:50:44,967 --> 00:50:46,370
Scott: it's already big tech people.

792
00:50:46,512 --> 00:50:48,110
Scott: It was there then it was you know.

793
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,507
Scott: Now it's like an everyday thing.

794
00:50:49,851 --> 00:50:50,982
Scott: It's an everyday thing for tech.

795
00:50:51,003 --> 00:50:55,504
Scott: people soon Expect to see it getting all over everybody who doesn't know what the fuck they're doing.

796
00:50:55,725 --> 00:50:57,090
Rym: I've seen it hitting hospitals.

797
00:50:57,331 --> 00:50:59,198
Rym: I've seen it hitting like big companies.

798
00:50:59,258 --> 00:51:06,930
Rym: internally where you know, even if you've got a pretty good company There's always the trade-off between how much you lock down your PCs versus do you trust your employees?

799
00:51:07,432 --> 00:51:11,584
Rym: If you trust the wrong person malware up is oh that guy had access to the backups.

800
00:51:11,966 --> 00:51:13,330
Scott: Oh, well, it's not even that.

801
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:13,732
Scott: It's like.

802
00:51:13,913 --> 00:51:17,090
Scott: if you know, even if your employees computers are way locked down and shit, right?

803
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:18,289
Scott: You don't let them install stuff.

804
00:51:18,531 --> 00:51:21,349
Scott: Hopefully that would prevent the ransomware from getting them in the first place.

805
00:51:21,772 --> 00:51:26,599
Scott: But if it doesn't because of some zero-day nonsense Maybe that person just has bad habits.

806
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:30,173
Scott: and like they're in accounting and they saved a bunch of Excel sheets on their hard drive And that's it.

807
00:51:30,374 --> 00:51:33,128
Scott: Yeah, I didn't back them up and you can't make them back them out.

808
00:51:33,168 --> 00:51:33,450
Rym: It's funny.

809
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:34,093
Rym: You mentioned that.

810
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:38,993
Rym: so one of the examples I just pull up a ton of like exactly your whole company needs those Excel sheets That are encrypted.

811
00:51:39,113 --> 00:51:43,490
Rym: I pulled up all these examples from the read from just recently just so I'd have like interesting points.

812
00:51:43,872 --> 00:51:55,270
Rym: There's the pet your ransomware, which is targeting HR departments in Germany specifically And because it's looking for that kind of situation of the HR person has a bunch of spreadsheets that they keep locally.

813
00:51:55,671 --> 00:51:59,645
Rym: They back it up occasionally like they're not stupid, but it's not automatically backed up.

814
00:51:59,685 --> 00:52:04,706
Rym: It's a thing just like on their PC Mm-hmm, and it goes one step further than just encrypting.

815
00:52:04,726 --> 00:52:14,224
Rym: it Crashes your PC into a BS OD suddenly once it's done and then when it tries to boot up It's encrypted the master boot record and all your data.

816
00:52:14,244 --> 00:52:27,438
Rym: Oh So they take that drive out and mount it on a Linux machine or something, yep Because zero days exist you pretty much cannot prevent 100% of the ways this could get a computer.

817
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:37,974
Rym: the only way to absolutely protect yourself Ransomware is to have good reliable automated backups and Redundancy.

818
00:52:38,235 --> 00:52:39,762
Scott: see me know what that's actually like.

819
00:52:40,204 --> 00:52:41,610
Scott: that's actually kind of okay, right?

820
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:45,070
Scott: Because you think about it a lot of other things like we're just gonna blow up your hard drive.

821
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:47,039
Scott: It's like if there's a zero day, you're just fucked.

822
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:52,610
Scott: Yeah, but something like this It's like oh, you know what backups are something you should be doing anyway.

823
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:57,369
Rym: But if you didn't you're basically paying a tax to a terrorist to get your photos back.

824
00:52:58,032 --> 00:52:59,156
Scott: I mean, they're evil for sure.

825
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:02,930
Scott: I'm not gonna say ransomware people are good, but at least they actually give you the files back.

826
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:12,926
Rym: Sometimes yeah, no sometimes I found another example where there's a. there's a brand somewhere that had a bug in it So it actually wouldn't decrypt the files properly.

827
00:53:12,946 --> 00:53:13,650
Rym: It would just give you gibberish.

828
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:18,250
Rym: But but someone like inspected the code and it looks like it's literally just a bug.

829
00:53:18,753 --> 00:53:25,166
Rym: So from what I can gather the guy who wrote the malware I thought the person who wrote the malware released a patch because they felt bad.

830
00:53:25,186 --> 00:53:33,690
Rym: Oh Okay, yeah They refunded the money of anyone who paid who fucked up like who lost their data and they released a patch.

831
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:37,889
Rym: So if they hadn't like if they still had the messed up data, it would fix it for them.

832
00:53:38,412 --> 00:53:38,954
Rym: So, you know what?

833
00:53:39,396 --> 00:53:42,689
Rym: There's a little bit of honor left among thieves like the tiniest bit.

834
00:53:44,331 --> 00:53:50,930
Scott: We are punishing people who don't make but maybe it's just a huge campaign to get everyone to make backups Except I used to advocate for that in mid in high school.

835
00:53:51,010 --> 00:54:00,070
Rym: I was like why don't I just write a malware that just nukes your computer and Just gives you and it fills your computer with nothing but pamphlets on how to have computer security?

836
00:54:01,555 --> 00:54:01,860
Scott: Sure.

837
00:54:01,981 --> 00:54:10,400
Rym: Yeah This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

838
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:15,180
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

861
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,278
Rym: We literally just recorded the March Q&A.

862
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:49,898
Rym: So submissions are open for the April one and will actually record it before the end of the month.

863
00:55:49,938 --> 00:55:53,374
Rym: for once It was ten questions and they were actually pretty good.

864
00:55:53,434 --> 00:55:54,700
Rym: I think it was a good episode that we did.

865
00:55:55,061 --> 00:55:58,752
Rym: We're not gonna do a show on Wednesday because we're heading out early Thursday morning to packs.

866
00:55:59,113 --> 00:56:12,398
Rym: So instead I'm gonna put it that up and Expect a whole bunch of patreon content right after we get from packs because there's no more Convention stuff for us to do until Connecticut and then PAX Prime and packs awesome.

867
00:56:12,418 --> 00:56:12,920
Rym: all that biz.

868
00:56:13,463 --> 00:56:15,799
Rym: So now I leave you with something strange.

869
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:22,231
Scott: In the 26th century mankind faces an epic struggle for survival.

870
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:25,899
Scott: the forces of nature have spun wildly out of control.

871
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:33,059
Scott: Oh Mighty cities have crumbled and the dinosaurs have returned to reclaim the earth.

872
00:56:36,765 --> 00:56:50,700
Scott: In this savage land one man stands alone Jack ten rank defending humanity in a world gone mad a world where only the strong survive a world of Cadillacs and dinosaurs.
