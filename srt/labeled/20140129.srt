00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,326
Rym: It's Wednesday January 29th 2014.

2
00:00:11,326 --> 00:00:23,770
Rym: I am Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight we're sir let's do this.

3
00:00:26,315 --> 00:00:27,277
Rym: so we were gonna do this.

4
00:00:27,317 --> 00:00:30,686
Rym: show about I guess cartoons.

5
00:00:30,706 --> 00:00:33,737
Scott: well he had this idea cartoons the hair dogs in them.

6
00:00:33,817 --> 00:00:51,096
Scott: no there were so many animated movies that are like I'm not have dogs in them but are about dogs like all dogs go to heaven or all dogs go to heaven to Oliver and company yeah or Lady and the Tramp yeah 101 Dalmatians.

7
00:00:51,257 --> 00:00:54,573
Rym: but you know we can do the same thing with cats I mean the Aristocats.

8
00:00:55,095 --> 00:00:58,410
Scott: there aren't as many cat all-purpose cultural cat girl Nuku Nuku.

9
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:03,007
Scott: okay if you go bad tank police if you go that far what about?

10
00:01:03,027 --> 00:01:03,911
Rym: what about the Jungle Book?

11
00:01:05,135 --> 00:01:10,980
Rym: Jungle Book is about monkeys and cats mostly monkeys cats in there and actually there's a lot of bear.

12
00:01:11,723 --> 00:01:22,267
Scott: the point is that while we know of something realize that there were so many dog movies in the animated category that we knew your luck hound and had seen in our lives.

13
00:01:22,287 --> 00:01:22,830
Rym: I want to point out.

14
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:36,842
Rym: the reason we thought of this is because apparently I'm the only person in the world who remembers a dog Tanyan and the three musket hounds and that's how it should be so while we realized there were so many of these musket hounds forever.

15
00:01:37,042 --> 00:01:50,575
Rym: it's been so long since we've seen any of them like.

16
00:01:50,696 --> 00:01:55,718
Scott: I only remember the Vegas like one sentence description of each one like Lady and the Tramp.

17
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:59,036
Scott: yeah there's a really nice dog who's a lady who lives in a nice house.

18
00:01:59,076 --> 00:02:04,623
Scott: I remember we found that you found a quiz that was like spaghetti behind the diner the Italian restaurant.

19
00:02:05,346 --> 00:02:06,491
Scott: then they finally get together.

20
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:06,813
Scott: the end.

21
00:02:07,315 --> 00:02:09,223
Rym: we should watch those all.

22
00:02:09,503 --> 00:02:10,991
Rym: let's watch one of those movies like.

23
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:11,793
Rym: I've seen it in 20 plus years.

24
00:02:11,813 --> 00:02:13,639
Scott: I remember when I was a super little kid.

25
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,444
Rym: Lady and the Tramp was one of my favorite movies ever.

26
00:02:19,504 --> 00:02:21,537
Scott: it was not one of my favorite movies.

27
00:02:21,779 --> 00:02:22,262
Rym: I don't know why.

28
00:02:22,302 --> 00:02:22,946
Rym: I just really liked it.

29
00:02:22,966 --> 00:02:28,995
Rym: a lot of reminded me of the sort of screwball comedy black-and-white romance movies that I was used to anyway.

30
00:02:29,036 --> 00:02:33,063
Scott: so we had to abandon that episode and do some other shit because we could barely remember any of these things.

31
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:39,354
Rym: well Scott found this quiz that was like name this dog from an animated movie and I'm looking at one of them and I'm like alright.

32
00:02:39,414 --> 00:02:41,803
Rym: so the options are Oliver II or company correct.

33
00:02:43,609 --> 00:02:45,118
Rym: Emily knew more than both of us combined.

34
00:02:45,138 --> 00:02:50,861
Rym: that's obvious like I knew Todd and copper from the Fox was which the hooned?

35
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:55,938
Rym: yeah yeah I thought Todd was the Fox but then maybe copper was the Fox.

36
00:02:55,978 --> 00:02:57,525
Rym: pretty sure Todd is the Fox.

37
00:02:57,827 --> 00:02:58,811
Scott: send your comments to him.

38
00:02:59,132 --> 00:03:01,643
Scott: yeah show off how that.

39
00:03:01,683 --> 00:03:03,169
Scott: you know this trivial piece of information.

40
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:05,761
Rym: if you are a dog-headed girl tell us all about your OC.

41
00:03:06,022 --> 00:03:10,082
Scott: create a set of questions for a time of trivia war 9000 about dog related.

42
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,273
Rym: oh my god actually you know we should bring back.

43
00:03:12,856 --> 00:03:14,564
Rym: we're smart enough to do it better now.

44
00:03:15,307 --> 00:03:16,211
Rym: challenge you're on fire.

45
00:03:16,272 --> 00:03:19,245
Rym: I still have the whole game show like ready to run.

46
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:20,229
Scott: it's all you okay?

47
00:03:20,249 --> 00:03:25,345
Rym: so anyway let's go to a video of us running that it like Katsucon 2007.

48
00:03:25,345 --> 00:03:28,979
Scott: I think we only tried to run a ConnectiCon once and failed.

49
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:36,091
Rym: no we ran it at Katsucon - remember we had all Stevie B and all the guests and basically none of the guests got past.

50
00:03:36,111 --> 00:03:43,737
Rym: the second question we're like well that's really disappointing anyway news.

51
00:03:43,977 --> 00:03:45,160
Scott: so boing.

52
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:57,283
Scott: boing made this post today snow piercer science fiction graphic novel about a train that carries all of Earth's remaining population and based on the title alone I'm like that is getting bought by me.

53
00:03:57,444 --> 00:03:59,412
Rym: that is up our alley.

54
00:03:59,432 --> 00:04:02,145
Scott: so let me read the longer description for you.

55
00:04:02,165 --> 00:04:05,758
Scott: so first of all it's it's I think there's two volumes.

56
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:08,728
Scott: the first volume came out today.

57
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:12,319
Scott: the next volume is coming out February 25th so really soon.

58
00:04:13,302 --> 00:04:21,276
Scott: it's a French novel and there's a new movie coming out based on it that will be released sometime in the first quarter of this year.

59
00:04:21,336 --> 00:04:24,071
Scott: so it's basically all coming out for us right now.

60
00:04:24,111 --> 00:04:39,244
Scott: but let me read the entirety of this incredible description that upon hearing which if your wallet doesn't empty itself stop listening and maybe I don't know don't listen to anything else ever again.

61
00:04:39,325 --> 00:04:39,666
Scott: okay.

62
00:04:39,686 --> 00:05:02,056
Scott: so let me read it coursing through an eternal winter coursing on an icy track wrapped around the frozen planet earth their travels snow piercer a train 1001 carriages long from fearsome engine to final car all surviving human life is here a complete hierarchy of the society.

63
00:05:02,116 --> 00:05:02,658
Scott: we lost.

64
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:11,093
Scott: the elite as ever travel in luxury at the front of the train but for those in the rear coaches life is squalid miserable and short.

65
00:05:11,293 --> 00:05:25,210
Scott: oh my gosh prologue is a refugee from the tail determined never to go back in his journey forward through the train he hopes to reach the mythical engine mythical engine and perhaps find some hope for the future.

66
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,275
Rym: the no just a big loop.

67
00:05:26,798 --> 00:05:30,818
Scott: the original graphic novels have been adapted then why didn't he just go backwards one car?

68
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:39,033
Scott: the original graphic novels one way darted into an astounding new film directed by June ho bong and distributed in the u.s.

69
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:40,804
Scott: by the Weinstein company do release his course.

70
00:05:40,844 --> 00:05:43,778
Scott: so it's a French comic with this incredible concept.

71
00:05:43,818 --> 00:05:52,922
Scott: that is something between Galaxy Express 39 Titanic and why the last man and Final Fantasy legend one.

72
00:05:52,942 --> 00:05:57,914
Rym: oh my god Final Fantasy legend one.

73
00:05:57,934 --> 00:06:00,323
Rym: oh my gosh it's a tower.

74
00:06:00,363 --> 00:06:00,845
Scott: they're trying to go.

75
00:06:00,865 --> 00:06:03,739
Scott: I know I know we should just like in the train.

76
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,906
Scott: they're trying to go forward.

77
00:06:05,147 --> 00:06:06,614
Rym: maybe we should do a show on that.

78
00:06:06,895 --> 00:06:08,642
Scott: we could do a Final Fantasy legend Tuesday.

79
00:06:08,682 --> 00:06:11,073
Scott: show my dad's a stealth bomber.

80
00:06:11,113 --> 00:06:12,119
Scott: how awesome is that shit?

81
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:18,980
Scott: oh and by the way it shot down the moon whale and then spoilers dude Zagor.

82
00:06:21,546 --> 00:06:23,189
Rym: so there's some news here.

83
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:29,573
Rym: I'm not gonna go through the whole history of what happened at anime Boston but suffice it to say there was.

84
00:06:29,593 --> 00:06:36,061
Rym: there was a news update for anime Boston 2014. it was posted January 24th so not that long ago.

85
00:06:36,081 --> 00:06:41,923
Rym: I give these dates in case you know dateline January 29th in case anything changes.

86
00:06:42,324 --> 00:06:47,589
Rym: so if something changes and you listen to this and you don't have other sources of news you get what you deserve.

87
00:06:48,493 --> 00:06:56,958
Rym: anime Boston is despite their quote best efforts of their staff and partners on quote not having a rave again.

88
00:06:58,462 --> 00:07:02,656
Rym: basically what happened is years ago there was an incident at the rave.

89
00:07:02,717 --> 00:07:03,561
Rym: they call it a dance.

90
00:07:03,662 --> 00:07:05,130
Rym: every anime con calls it a dance.

91
00:07:05,552 --> 00:07:07,640
Rym: every attendee of anime cons calls it a rave.

92
00:07:08,503 --> 00:07:09,668
Rym: an incident happened.

93
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,321
Rym: police were involved and the thing got shut down.

94
00:07:12,361 --> 00:07:15,635
Rym: I think that was the year that we were at PAX East two or three years ago.

95
00:07:15,676 --> 00:07:15,997
Scott: I don't know.

96
00:07:16,338 --> 00:07:24,083
Rym: I think it was two thousand and there have been incidents of many natures.

97
00:07:24,183 --> 00:07:26,593
Scott: it pretty much every anime con rave dance.

98
00:07:26,753 --> 00:07:33,500
Rym: okay here I think it was 2012. okay the informal dance as they called it but there's huge quotes around.

99
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,088
Rym: that is the rave got shut down.

100
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:38,784
Rym: there's a forum thread in their forum that's like why the dance gets shut down.

101
00:07:38,804 --> 00:07:42,096
Rym: so there's a police and ambulance blah blah blah.

102
00:07:42,617 --> 00:07:57,443
Rym: so they tried in 2013 to have the dance again and they had to move it to another venue because the incident was big enough to where the hotel convention center the Heinz that they use would not let them host it there for various reasons.

103
00:07:57,503 --> 00:07:59,416
Scott: you had a problem with this event last time.

104
00:07:59,436 --> 00:07:59,799
Scott: you're lucky.

105
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:05,833
Scott: we're still letting you be here at all because we want money but we can still make you cancel that one event and you can't nowhere else to go.

106
00:08:05,954 --> 00:08:08,545
Rym: so I'm gonna quote the thing from last year.

107
00:08:09,227 --> 00:08:13,192
Rym: unfortunately after the space was contracting everything was in place to hold the dance.

108
00:08:13,573 --> 00:08:17,411
Rym: our entertainment license for the informal dance was rejected so by the city.

109
00:08:18,155 --> 00:08:24,330
Rym: over the past several weeks I have personally reached out to police city and state representatives to find out the reason why our license were rejected.

110
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:35,938
Rym: the reasons were one there are a bunch of other events happening at the same time like Red Sox games which I think is kind of bogus because the same thing happens with Ravens games and Otakon on a regular basis.

111
00:08:37,164 --> 00:08:45,780
Rym: and but as a result quote the Boston Police Department could not assign any detail officers to anime Boston's informal dance.

112
00:08:46,542 --> 00:09:02,362
Rym: Two, after reviewing what happened last year the city of Boston needs a robust security and medical plan their primary concerns revolving around overcrowding issues and I'm quoting a hundred percent here the behavior of a very small segment of our attendee population.

113
00:09:03,366 --> 00:09:15,823
Rym: so the city basically said no dance for you guys in 2013. so as it was announced now also no dance in 2014 for what appears to be the same reasons.

114
00:09:16,244 --> 00:09:24,045
Rym: all right I think and this is why I'm putting this in the news this is not super exciting news except that I think this is the best thing that's ever happened.

115
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:24,709
Rym: anime Boston.

116
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:27,783
Rym: I think they should just drop the rave excuse to not have it.

117
00:09:27,924 --> 00:09:33,308
Rym: yes because anime cons have this cultural problem where they will all copy each other.

118
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:35,037
Rym: because well it's an anime con.

119
00:09:35,077 --> 00:09:36,243
Rym: that's just what you do.

120
00:09:36,504 --> 00:09:39,542
Rym: you have the Thursday badge pickup even though you should really mail the badges.

121
00:09:39,844 --> 00:09:42,760
Rym: you have to have the AMV contest gotta have the cosplay skits.

122
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:46,014
Rym: you gotta do all these things that every anime con does.

123
00:09:46,556 --> 00:09:47,178
Rym: no you don't.

124
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,165
Rym: you could do something different.

125
00:09:49,185 --> 00:09:51,213
Rym: guys try something different.

126
00:09:51,293 --> 00:09:58,272
Scott: it might go really well it might go badly but no what'll happen is all these kids will show up expecting all those things and there won't be any of those things.

127
00:09:58,653 --> 00:10:06,790
Scott: I remember it'll become lobby con and they'll just hang out in the hallways doing whatever they do all the time and get bored and maybe go home.

128
00:10:07,392 --> 00:10:08,838
Rym: but I remember in 2013

129
00:10:08,838 --> 00:10:09,963
Scott: a lot of people

130
00:10:10,284 --> 00:10:22,233
Rym: who were grumbling like they were walking around like asking people where's the dance like they had literally at no point before anime Boston gone to its website at no point before or during it looked at its schedule probably had never looked in the con book.

131
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:26,671
Rym: no they just assume that it has all the things that every anime con has.

132
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:45,601
Scott: I mean how many times did we go to anime conventions and or any kind of convention and people would basically see there was some kind of dance party going on and coming off the street or come just for the dance as you know because it's like oh you know I mean they're like clubs and bars that will have dances and people go to those specifically.

133
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:52,942
Scott: so if a convention they don't care about the convention surrounding that dance they're just like oh there's a dance there I'll go to that and it happens

134
00:10:53,284 --> 00:10:59,520
Rym: yeah though it's they have to get a badge to get into it unless the staff of the building and or convention are really bad

135
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,002
Scott: at checking

136
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,531
Rym: and keeping people who shouldn't be there

137
00:11:01,671 --> 00:11:01,812
Scott: out.

138
00:11:02,053 --> 00:11:06,190
Scott: I've seen that happen a lot in my bad conventions don't check so on.

139
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:13,552
Rym: I think anime Boston should embrace this and just give up on the dance and do something else like they have their in their formal ball which I think is really cool.

140
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:14,959
Rym: ConnectiCon does something similar.

141
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:16,527
Scott: therefore like magfest.

142
00:11:16,868 --> 00:11:18,576
Scott: no wait that's still copying someone.

143
00:11:18,656 --> 00:11:21,530
Rym: that copy someone just don't all copy each other.

144
00:11:21,912 --> 00:11:25,190
Rym: it'd be like if I copied Scott and everything in my life and he copied me.

145
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:26,980
Rym: that doesn't work in the long run.

146
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,705
Rym: that's just a circle.

147
00:11:27,745 --> 00:11:29,993
Scott: jerk you know what I would do if I had an awesome convention.

148
00:11:30,013 --> 00:11:38,516
Scott: yeah I would have the non free feast a feast a catered feast.

149
00:11:38,978 --> 00:11:44,603
Rym: you gotta have big pieces of meat with that bone stick long ass tables reserved seating whatever.

150
00:11:44,623 --> 00:11:48,240
Rym: they gotta be tables big enough to have a tankard of ale and smash it down.

151
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:48,943
Scott: that's right.

152
00:11:49,907 --> 00:11:51,274
Rym: there's gotta be dogs walking around.

153
00:11:51,294 --> 00:12:00,841
Scott: you got a guy have a big fat King just slopping and yelling catered feast with entertainment and there would only be like a few hundred seats or however many at the long-ass Scott's.

154
00:12:01,645 --> 00:12:04,317
Rym: I've been to conventions that have exactly what you want.

155
00:12:04,337 --> 00:12:05,844
Scott: yeah but those are Ren fairs.

156
00:12:05,884 --> 00:12:06,828
Scott: yes that's not.

157
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:08,776
Scott: I'm talking like at packs.

158
00:12:09,157 --> 00:12:17,835
Scott: imagine if like the 200 people at packs who paid the most charity or whatever you know to the fundraising dinner you mean like that fundraising dinner we went to.

159
00:12:18,517 --> 00:12:23,537
Scott: or it could be like you know a tabletop RPG feast at a gaming con.

160
00:12:23,718 --> 00:12:28,798
Scott: you get seated at a table where you roll them bones and then eat meat off them bones.

161
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:32,414
Scott: but seriously I think she chose the vegetarian out.

162
00:12:32,514 --> 00:12:46,660
Rym: I think this is great and anime Boston needs to embrace it mostly because if anime cons are have such a stick up their butts about usually because they're a nonprofit and they have a charter and whatever that their programming can only be anime programming.

163
00:12:47,483 --> 00:12:56,756
Rym: then how do they justify the raves that mostly play generic house and dubstep and dance music even though they used to a long time ago?

164
00:12:56,837 --> 00:12:59,532
Scott: there's gonna be at least one or two DJs playing the anime.

165
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:01,862
Scott: yeah but they won't.

166
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:05,558
Rym: I mean most of them won't accept panels that aren't just a hundred percent about anime.

167
00:13:05,698 --> 00:13:08,008
Rym: hmm and they make a big deal about that.

168
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,762
Rym: but then they have the completely generic dance.

169
00:13:10,842 --> 00:13:11,947
Scott: they have a tabletop room.

170
00:13:12,309 --> 00:13:13,453
Rym: yeah exactly.

171
00:13:14,014 --> 00:13:23,924
Rym: so also the culture in anime convention rave slash dances is toxic but it's toxic in this like 14 year old wannabe way.

172
00:13:23,944 --> 00:13:43,931
Rym: I'm amazed at the behavior I see in these things that every con I go to especially because back in like I don't know 2006 2007 I'd go to like Katsucon and Friday night of the con it was 80s music and it was all people like my age dancing and the anime kids would come in and be like what is this and then walk out or they'd play.

173
00:13:43,971 --> 00:13:44,332
Rym: I don't know.

174
00:13:44,814 --> 00:13:52,181
Rym: anime dance mixes at least at least give some sort of lip service to the music being at least almost Japanese.

175
00:13:52,903 --> 00:14:08,855
Rym: but separate aside the excuses that the city of Boston everything gave our lame excuses don't make sense because one Boston is actually kind of known for having literally one of the best medical and trauma center responses available in the entire United States.

176
00:14:09,437 --> 00:14:17,760
Rym: Boston is known for its ability to deal with mash cat mass casualties for a long time not because they've had so many incidents but just because that's what Boston is known for.

177
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,773
Rym: there's a lot of hospitals there's a lot of experts.

178
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:28,638
Rym: actually I read two a separate article saying that that was a big contributor to why so many people were able to get such good treatment so quickly after the Boston bombings.

179
00:14:28,658 --> 00:14:38,412
Rym: so the the fact that the city made it so hard for anime Boston to have these dances really implies to me and this is just me speculating.

180
00:14:38,532 --> 00:14:48,752
Rym: I think Boston does not want to have a PR problem with a convention mostly attended by young people having a police incident or a fatality or something.

181
00:14:48,893 --> 00:15:02,982
Scott: there must be at least one person in the Boston government or bureaucracy who remembers what happened in anime Boston right and is just now you know has written that down and it's in the black book or it's on somewhere and they remember it and they're gonna hold to that.

182
00:15:03,042 --> 00:15:06,740
Scott: now right it's someone somewhere or some record.

183
00:15:07,122 --> 00:15:07,684
Scott: has you know?

184
00:15:07,704 --> 00:15:12,873
Scott: maybe someone in the police department or something like has them you know given the black mark after the incident and that's it.

185
00:15:13,134 --> 00:15:28,465
Rym: the saddest thing is the statement from this year says quote but unfortunately we could not find a location that would meet safety requirements was within a realistic budget and then there's a big final and here after the comma and be approved by the venues management.

186
00:15:29,248 --> 00:15:31,033
Rym: there's a lot implied by that.

187
00:15:31,856 --> 00:15:33,962
Rym: so yeah good luck.

188
00:15:34,043 --> 00:15:34,745
Rym: anime Boston.

189
00:15:34,765 --> 00:15:38,117
Rym: I have zero sympathy for the kids who show up expecting there to be a rave.

190
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:48,856
Scott: I hope anime Boston like basically said that and didn't even try just paying lip service to those kids that that is the kind of thing that we would do.

191
00:15:48,876 --> 00:15:51,549
Scott: let's not even try to have a dance.

192
00:15:51,569 --> 00:15:56,905
Scott: let's just write that we tried and failed so that people can't be hating on us and then that the you know we'll say we tried and failed and we did.

193
00:15:56,945 --> 00:16:02,094
Rym: yeah dog I really wanted to schedule your fifth the homestuck panel but there just wasn't room but Rym.

194
00:16:02,114 --> 00:16:03,299
Rym: there's like five empty rooms.

195
00:16:03,981 --> 00:16:08,679
Rym: yeah fire code those rooms have to be empty at those times.

196
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:11,328
Scott: staff to man those rooms right there.

197
00:16:11,348 --> 00:16:13,278
Rym: you've got eight staff just sitting behind you right now.

198
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,029
Scott: they're all busy doing something.

199
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:16,394
Scott: they're playing teach you.

200
00:16:16,414 --> 00:16:20,329
Scott: yeah it's for the teacher tournament.

201
00:16:20,349 --> 00:16:21,172
Scott: later they're practicing.

202
00:16:21,192 --> 00:16:21,957
Scott: get the rules down.

203
00:16:21,977 --> 00:16:22,298
Scott: they got it.

204
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,344
Scott: they got to manage it.

205
00:16:23,364 --> 00:16:25,776
Scott: their panel staff not gaming staff.

206
00:16:25,836 --> 00:16:31,582
Rym: well there's only so many staff here at that point that's when one of our staff is quietly come under behind them to just tase them.

207
00:16:31,844 --> 00:16:41,926
Rym: all right let's move on two things of the day.

208
00:16:41,946 --> 00:16:48,428
Rym: if you're one of those nerds there's a lot of you out there who makes fun of football and sports people.

209
00:16:48,488 --> 00:16:50,481
Rym: and doesn't you know you get mad about the Super Bowl.

210
00:16:50,522 --> 00:16:57,804
Rym: you make a point of being like I'm not gonna watch the Super Bowl or I only watch the Super Bowl because of the ads one shut up - they're just as nerdy as you.

211
00:16:57,864 --> 00:16:59,431
Rym: and three the Super Bowl is pretty awesome.

212
00:17:00,074 --> 00:17:11,317
Rym: so if you don't know anything about sports ball this is a very short pretty funny video that will explain the only things you actually need to know to be able to enjoy watching sports ball.

213
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,064
Scott: that's all.

214
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:13,506
Scott: that's it.

215
00:17:13,627 --> 00:17:14,048
Scott: that's it.

216
00:17:14,249 --> 00:17:14,651
Rym: it's a thing.

217
00:17:14,671 --> 00:17:17,523
Rym: no it's the best thing I saw today that I can share.

218
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:29,391
Scott: so you know there's a lot of animes lately that are like these short animes just for YouTube the most recent good ones of which are turning girls and inferno cup inferno cup.

219
00:17:29,612 --> 00:17:30,716
Scott: have you watched inferno cup?

220
00:17:30,737 --> 00:17:32,042
Rym: I've watched some inferno cup.

221
00:17:32,263 --> 00:17:35,134
Scott: okay so there's a new one that is not bad.

222
00:17:35,435 --> 00:17:36,640
Scott: it's definitely the best one.

223
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:42,210
Scott: since those it remains yet to be seen the overall quality but it's good enough that I want to watch more of it.

224
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:45,260
Scott: based on the first episode it's called senpai club.

225
00:17:46,182 --> 00:17:52,802
Scott: it is the first episode is pretty much the most stereotypical anime you've ever seen.

226
00:17:53,184 --> 00:17:55,370
Scott: right and it knows it.

227
00:17:55,430 --> 00:18:00,534
Scott: it's doing all the cliches a hundred percent on purpose to the point is which the girl is like.

228
00:18:00,715 --> 00:18:02,002
Scott: oh no I am late for school.

229
00:18:02,203 --> 00:18:04,032
Scott: oh no I can't hold this toast in my mouth.

230
00:18:04,313 --> 00:18:06,801
Scott: oh you know it's anime.

231
00:18:06,821 --> 00:18:15,872
Scott: the anime yes it is animated anime which has been done before but the something about the way this is doing it is even more literal.

232
00:18:15,892 --> 00:18:16,714
Scott: I think.

233
00:18:16,754 --> 00:18:17,476
Rym: what really does?

234
00:18:17,536 --> 00:18:18,658
Rym: it is the opening theme.

235
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:25,318
Scott: yeah and just the way it's drawn is sort of.

236
00:18:25,499 --> 00:18:27,649
Scott: you know it's like a higher quality than turning girls.

237
00:18:27,709 --> 00:18:30,500
Scott: it's more animated but it isn't drawn that much better.

238
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:37,283
Rym: then they like that point where she's just like back about go back go back go back and I'm the subtitles are saying something completely different.

239
00:18:37,304 --> 00:18:37,384
Scott: yeah.

240
00:18:37,405 --> 00:18:37,990
Scott: and then they have like.

241
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:41,930
Scott: they even have like the the fake sponsorship to where they're like you know.

242
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,836
Scott: oh sponsored week you know.

243
00:18:45,922 --> 00:18:48,730
Scott: and then this concept of the senpai club.

244
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,894
Scott: I just want to know more.

245
00:18:49,974 --> 00:18:52,645
Scott: like there's a club of senpais I don't get.

246
00:18:53,086 --> 00:18:55,214
Scott: tell me more is it is it really?

247
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,221
Scott: this is like the harem I don't know.

248
00:18:58,425 --> 00:18:59,809
Scott: we'll see it's.

249
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,180
Scott: it's pretty if you have watched.

250
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:04,110
Scott: I mean this isn't something that everyone will like.

251
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:08,768
Scott: but if you have watched an anime yeah or then you will under you'll like.

252
00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:14,349
Rym: well if you've watched more than one anime right like watching this at a moment.

253
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:18,405
Rym: the book club book was I do by William Gibson.

254
00:19:18,445 --> 00:19:19,589
Rym: it was a pretty good book.

255
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:22,644
Rym: I've read it twice Scott classic doing a show on it.

256
00:19:22,684 --> 00:19:24,814
Rym: as soon as we can the next book will be a wool.

257
00:19:25,136 --> 00:19:30,619
Scott: I'll make a page about it like to a shit that lambs got on them that you go and take it off and make a sweater.

258
00:19:30,819 --> 00:19:46,826
Rym: that shit yes it's another sci-fi novel though my non book club recommendation to anyone who wants good sci-fi to read look at our book club for player of games and read that book because I'm almost done reading every single book that E&M banks ever wrote.

259
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:52,646
Scott: my recommendation is you should go back and read prince of nothing.

260
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,192
Rym: I was about to check.

261
00:19:54,897 --> 00:20:03,412
Rym: I was waiting for you to finish saying that cuz I was gonna look at the next prince of nothing the official GeekNights' book if there's ever been a book that was.

262
00:20:03,432 --> 00:20:07,229
Rym: I think almost everyone in the front row crew has read this book.

263
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:10,281
Rym: almost everyone we talked to on a regular basis has read this book.

264
00:20:10,983 --> 00:20:14,557
Rym: good god can't see when the next book is coming out.

265
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:15,882
Rym: aspect Emperor.

266
00:20:15,902 --> 00:20:16,886
Rym: but why like warrior?

267
00:20:17,609 --> 00:20:23,524
Scott: whatever the official book series not book club of the month but just official book.

268
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:26,817
Rym: oh I got excited for a second.

269
00:20:26,837 --> 00:20:28,106
Rym: I was like oh did the new book come out?

270
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,654
Rym: no it's just Canadian book cover.

271
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,824
Rym: yeah exactly right that got me.

272
00:20:31,865 --> 00:20:32,809
Rym: that gets all of us.

273
00:20:32,829 --> 00:20:36,325
Scott: they'll get you every time any other meta things.

274
00:20:36,345 --> 00:20:37,811
Scott: you should go on the internet and find us.

275
00:20:37,851 --> 00:20:47,390
Scott: we have YouTube videos and we have most important accounts and Facebook's and Google+ and forums and lots of our lectures from conventions are online.

276
00:20:47,772 --> 00:20:50,988
Rym: also we have another show we're doing called GeekNights presents.

277
00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:57,417
Rym: we're going through every goddamn episode of Jojo Kakumei utenna analyzing it in excruciating detail.

278
00:20:57,437 --> 00:20:59,386
Rym: mm-hmm it's a pretty good show.

279
00:20:59,406 --> 00:21:00,310
Rym: I'm actually really excited.

280
00:21:00,571 --> 00:21:03,064
Rym: and not do 10 about our thing is it gets fun to do.

281
00:21:03,446 --> 00:21:11,682
Rym: we're gonna try to do this more and faster but that really depends on you getting other people to watch it so that I have more incentive to spend all the time it takes to make it.

282
00:21:13,589 --> 00:21:16,679
Rym: and yeah so we didn't do the dog episode.

283
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,603
Scott: no we didn't.

284
00:21:17,623 --> 00:21:17,864
Scott: we do.

285
00:21:17,884 --> 00:21:19,611
Scott: cuz I just you know what it would be.

286
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:22,948
Scott: I realized we you know we could do it but just be so boring.

287
00:21:22,989 --> 00:21:24,397
Scott: I'd be like so hundred one Dalmatians.

288
00:21:24,638 --> 00:21:27,675
Scott: she really wanted to make a code out of them and failed the end.

289
00:21:27,896 --> 00:21:28,740
Scott: that's all I remember.

290
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:38,552
Rym: I would probably have a lot to say about all dogs go to heaven because that movie is pretty clear in my memory from it whatsoever other than there is a movie about dogs and it's called all dogs go to heaven.

291
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:38,914
Rym: all right.

292
00:21:38,934 --> 00:21:47,630
Rym: well you know what guys tell us which animated movie that features a protagonist dog we should watch and we'll watch it and do a show.

293
00:21:48,032 --> 00:21:50,284
Scott: instead of the all dogs episode just the one movie.

294
00:21:50,364 --> 00:21:57,081
Rym: let's pick one movie that has a dog as the as it has to be the protagonist sure so he went to crunchy roll to look for some animes to watch.

295
00:21:57,141 --> 00:22:07,662
Scott: I tried to pick one that no one had ever heard of or was just out of nowhere and the one that we noticed that we picked because it had short ass episodes four minutes long we love.

296
00:22:07,682 --> 00:22:10,895
Scott: that was Wooser's hand to mouth life.

297
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:12,482
Scott: so obviously it's an anime.

298
00:22:12,924 --> 00:22:28,333
Scott: it has short four minute episodes and apparently it's in its second season and the first episode we watched was actually the first episode of the second season and we went back and watched like three to five random episodes from the first and second seasons once we realized our mistake.

299
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:32,205
Scott: and yeah what the hell is this shit.

300
00:22:32,586 --> 00:22:33,408
Scott: so I don't get it.

301
00:22:33,429 --> 00:22:33,509
Scott: this

302
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:45,325
Rym: is the kind of thing where remember back at RIT anime when we showed everyone Excel saga and people flipped their shit yeah about how zany and crazy it was like what like it was so different from what they were used to but

303
00:22:45,485 --> 00:22:48,400
Scott: it was a hyperactive energy that this did not have.

304
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,615
Scott: this is like Excel saga like just chillin like what's up.

305
00:22:51,957 --> 00:22:57,883
Rym: this is a lot more like actually both in animation style and in humor and an amount of dialogue.

306
00:22:58,145 --> 00:23:02,263
Rym: it's a lot like the cutscenes in WarioWare on the GameCube mmm like.

307
00:23:02,303 --> 00:23:05,761
Rym: it reminds me of that more than anything and the opener is really video gamey.

308
00:23:06,063 --> 00:23:07,831
Rym: the interstitials are very video gamey

309
00:23:08,192 --> 00:23:08,373
Scott: yep

310
00:23:08,794 --> 00:23:17,602
Rym: but if we showed some episodes of this to the same anime club that was super excited about Excel saga back in the day they

311
00:23:17,642 --> 00:23:18,868
Scott: met when they liked it like

312
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:22,890
Rym: in the days before YouTube they would have liked it just because it was weird.

313
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:23,814
Rym: they'd be like what.

314
00:23:24,095 --> 00:23:25,280
Rym: oh my god what was that?

315
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:25,842
Rym: I know.

316
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:32,513
Rym: but stuff like this really does not hold up in the modern era when I could see weird things anytime I want on YouTube.

317
00:23:32,573 --> 00:23:35,208
Scott: so the concept here is you have this creature named Wooser.

318
00:23:35,268 --> 00:23:43,273
Scott: he's a monster or an animal that doesn't have a name and he basically is a really perverted.

319
00:23:43,595 --> 00:23:47,976
Scott: he likes to look up skirts and whatever and it's kind of horrible typical anime garbage there.

320
00:23:48,117 --> 00:23:50,064
Scott: well right he like.

321
00:23:50,084 --> 00:23:50,827
Scott: he wants money.

322
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:54,586
Scott: I guess he has never has a job but you never really see him getting money.

323
00:23:54,626 --> 00:23:56,595
Scott: he just says literally that he wants money.

324
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:57,619
Rym: he also wants meat.

325
00:23:58,121 --> 00:24:01,375
Scott: he likes to eat meat and he's just sort of around.

326
00:24:01,435 --> 00:24:05,092
Scott: and there's these twin girls Rin and Len and they'll just be.

327
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:12,250
Scott: even though it's a four-minute episode the episode will be split into like multiple segments right that have almost nothing to do with each other.

328
00:24:12,331 --> 00:24:20,495
Scott: most of the time early some of the time they do have something to do with each other but rarely and random shit happens in each one and I think each one is supposed to be a joke.

329
00:24:21,058 --> 00:24:25,081
Scott: but only one of them that we saw out of like five episodes is funny but it was pretty funny.

330
00:24:25,222 --> 00:24:28,461
Scott: it was pretty funny if one of them was funny but the rest were just sort of like either.

331
00:24:28,924 --> 00:24:31,297
Scott: like the first episode of the second season was like whoa.

332
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:34,633
Scott: that's really perverted anime garbage I don't want to watch.

333
00:24:35,878 --> 00:24:38,208
Scott: you know we're like girls playing tennis oh my god.

334
00:24:38,248 --> 00:24:45,543
Scott: where he's like creeping on him from the behind the tree yeah or when it's raining and he's like oh yeah girls and their blouses are all wet.

335
00:24:45,563 --> 00:24:50,265
Rym: yeah I can see their bras kind of through the translucent shirts like yeah not interested in that.

336
00:24:50,647 --> 00:24:53,319
Rym: yeah there's literally one funny episode right?

337
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:53,941
Scott: yeah?

338
00:24:53,982 --> 00:24:58,341
Scott: so the one funny bit in one of the episodes was basically you see a girl.

339
00:24:58,702 --> 00:25:21,208
Scott: she seems to be at a club at school and she's playing a bass and then there's a second girl also playing the bass and there's a third girl playing a stand-up bass and then the fourth girl is playing air bass but she's making the noises with her mouth right and then you see Wooster like looking through the it that is.

340
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,117
Scott: you know that was the only funny bit we've seen.

341
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:27,859
Rym: the jokes are basically jack handy that he'll make observations and that's it.

342
00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:35,691
Rym: he'll be like if an adult says that they're not gonna do anything they're probably about to do something like I will.

343
00:25:35,832 --> 00:25:44,292
Scott: you know these girls will walk up the stairs not saying anything or just chatting away and on the wall you see posters that are like don't pull down skirts.

344
00:25:44,313 --> 00:25:46,062
Scott: so the picture of Wooster pulling down skirts.

345
00:25:46,183 --> 00:25:50,906
Scott: and then after they walk up the stairs you'll see him on the stairs that he got trampled.

346
00:25:51,488 --> 00:25:55,266
Scott: he was all happy he looked up the skirts and he's like I can die now and then he dies.

347
00:25:55,286 --> 00:26:06,150
Rym: so this thing is based on a journal column by a member of supercell which is actually a band okay which would explain why it was even made in the first place.

348
00:26:06,271 --> 00:26:06,854
Rym: why people know?

349
00:26:06,874 --> 00:26:07,639
Scott: I don't understand what that.

350
00:26:08,102 --> 00:26:09,891
Scott: what can that journal column be like?

351
00:26:11,074 --> 00:26:17,032
Rym: I imagine based on no research and just this show that it's a Japanese jack handy?

352
00:26:17,593 --> 00:26:17,995
Scott: I don't know.

353
00:26:18,075 --> 00:26:19,239
Scott: it's just really weird.

354
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:32,525
Rym: also kids do any of you know what jack handy is without looking it up the ones who aren't kids do yeah.

355
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,717
Rym: so I guess that was a review of worse.

356
00:26:37,738 --> 00:26:38,843
Rym: there's hand-to-mouth life.

357
00:26:39,024 --> 00:26:45,719
Scott: yeah it's at least the title has some relation to what happens right hand-to-mouth implying that he's poor and he does want money a lot.

358
00:26:46,301 --> 00:26:51,727
Scott: so but in I don't see how it's a depiction of his life and the art style changes a lot.

359
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:54,161
Scott: right there was an episode where they turn into magical girls.

360
00:26:54,624 --> 00:26:59,044
Scott: it's one of those things where it's not ultra super deformed it is mostly super deformed.

361
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:04,626
Scott: I think there was like recently we discussed like the desu meter on the forums.

362
00:27:05,028 --> 00:27:07,842
Scott: so I guess it's like desu meter seven and it'll.

363
00:27:07,922 --> 00:27:10,596
Scott: actually it'll never go farther than that at least not that I've seen.

364
00:27:10,636 --> 00:27:18,689
Scott: but it'll pull back and go to a lower desu amount you know for you know yeah which is sort of what Dama kadobitsu does.

365
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:20,879
Scott: oh yeah right same same kind of thing.

366
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:24,236
Rym: but Dama kadobitsu is one of the funniest anime ever made right.

367
00:27:24,256 --> 00:27:27,753
Scott: but animation wise the default is kind of like really cutesy and whatnot.

368
00:27:27,793 --> 00:27:32,314
Scott: and then it'll pull back to be less cutesy to do magical girl joke or a perverted joke.

369
00:27:33,578 --> 00:27:37,209
Rym: but yeah honestly it's really not worth watching

370
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:41,092
Scott: even though the episodes are only four minutes and the opener and closer take up half

371
00:27:41,373 --> 00:27:47,536
Rym: kind of reviewed it only because I can't find anyone else who's reviewed it other than we

372
00:27:47,577 --> 00:27:54,936
Scott: tried to find something that we and crunchyroll just looking through the list that we had never heard of and don't think anyone else had heard of or cared about at all.

373
00:27:55,217 --> 00:27:59,177
Rym: Wow so the only reviews I found are people posting reviews in forums.

374
00:27:59,358 --> 00:28:00,161
Scott: and what are they saying?

375
00:28:00,342 --> 00:28:03,218
Scott: up first I thought let's discuss these reviews for hilarity.

376
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:04,063
Rym: all right all right.

377
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:05,150
Rym: so here's a crunchyroll review.

378
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:12,034
Rym: this guy gave it five stars whoa maybe first I thought this was a mediocre kids show with nothing special.

379
00:28:12,115 --> 00:28:14,463
Rym: cutesy little girls anime boy.

380
00:28:14,503 --> 00:28:15,446
Rym: was I wrong?

381
00:28:15,908 --> 00:28:18,879
Rym: this is a cock tease to anime with simple design.

382
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:26,948
Rym: the humor is great the animation is surprisingly amazing for something so simple and woo sir I love him.

383
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:29,338
Rym: this guy such a sweetheart I can't take it.

384
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,394
Rym: he makes this show work with how naughty he actually is.

385
00:28:33,414 --> 00:28:34,879
Rym: do check it out.

386
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,143
Rym: it's just amazing.

387
00:28:36,244 --> 00:28:38,652
Rym: this guy so dear wrote that review.

388
00:28:39,293 --> 00:28:40,657
Scott: you are the fucking problem.

389
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,823
Rym: I don't want to do not be that guy.

390
00:28:42,843 --> 00:28:47,863
Rym: okay I found every review this guy's master placed.

391
00:28:48,205 --> 00:28:48,587
Rym: I let's see.

392
00:28:48,607 --> 00:28:50,418
Rym: I'm looking at what other things this guy's reviewed.

393
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,087
Rym: he reviewed miss monochrome.

394
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:53,633
Rym: the animation only gave it two stars.

395
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:57,703
Rym: he bolds a lot of random words spoiler.

396
00:28:58,004 --> 00:29:01,735
Rym: okay he keeps posting on woo sir.

397
00:29:01,775 --> 00:29:03,361
Rym: I guess he really likes woo sir.

398
00:29:03,723 --> 00:29:04,606
Scott: he's into woo sir.

399
00:29:05,028 --> 00:29:06,814
Scott: yeah he's the woo sir number one fan.

400
00:29:08,861 --> 00:29:11,148
Rym: ah it's hard to tell what he's done.

401
00:29:11,188 --> 00:29:12,554
Rym: this forms actually not that good.

402
00:29:12,575 --> 00:29:16,454
Rym: all right wow there's a bunch of people who really like woo sir.

403
00:29:16,816 --> 00:29:19,610
Rym: in a short amount of time they pack a punch with this anime.

404
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:26,517
Rym: hilarious to the core fun to the point and the fan images at the end means it has a big following.

405
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:28,386
Rym: also go to the website following.

406
00:29:28,426 --> 00:29:29,974
Scott: I don't deny that it has a second season.

407
00:29:30,154 --> 00:29:30,717
Rym: wait a minute.

408
00:29:31,139 --> 00:29:34,614
Rym: also go to the website and see some of the stuff you can buy.

409
00:29:34,634 --> 00:29:37,082
Rym: I laughed at most of its.

410
00:29:37,865 --> 00:29:41,935
Rym: I wonder if some of these are astroturf.

411
00:29:41,955 --> 00:29:42,961
Rym: yeah they got that review.

412
00:29:43,303 --> 00:29:47,021
Rym: that's the only thing that guy's ever reviewed and he doesn't have any other posts.

413
00:29:47,725 --> 00:29:49,855
Scott: you think he's trying to sell woo sir merchandise?

414
00:29:49,895 --> 00:29:51,503
Rym: I think that might be some astroturfing.

415
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:56,531
Scott: all right these review reviews are surprisingly trying to find a review with a low number of stuff.

416
00:29:56,551 --> 00:29:57,800
Rym: all right here's the lowest review.

417
00:29:58,203 --> 00:29:58,868
Rym: two stars.

418
00:29:59,913 --> 00:30:01,298
Rym: woo sir's hands-to-mouth life.

419
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:09,015
Rym: basically another show focused more on the design and cuteness of the characters and on the content itself with a childish humor which isn't bad.

420
00:30:09,256 --> 00:30:15,846
Rym: this is all spelled wrong by the way then sometimes makes you turn your head in embarrassment which is already.

421
00:30:15,886 --> 00:30:16,872
Rym: keep spelling which wrong.

422
00:30:16,912 --> 00:30:18,460
Scott: this guy's got the right idea.

423
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:31,265
Rym: I just can't write might be enjoyable by some but if you expect something deep and memorable you better jump to the bottom of a well for that you know what that's funny cuz of well is deep.

424
00:30:31,285 --> 00:30:34,513
Scott: I'm using that.

425
00:30:34,593 --> 00:30:36,684
Scott: thanks guy who can't spell you.

426
00:30:36,725 --> 00:30:40,603
Scott: actually you're a guy with good ideas who should take some English classes.

427
00:30:40,623 --> 00:30:41,829
Rym: all right frog socks.

428
00:30:41,869 --> 00:30:42,471
Rym: what else I like?

429
00:30:42,492 --> 00:30:45,243
Scott: the way you think you just got to work on your spelling.

430
00:30:45,263 --> 00:30:53,756
Scott: oh no it's not frogs ox's Darien kin huh or maybe it's a smart person who just doesn't have English as a first language.

431
00:30:53,816 --> 00:30:54,842
Scott: true that's you know.

432
00:30:54,882 --> 00:30:56,973
Rym: it's also the only review he's ever written.

433
00:30:57,114 --> 00:30:57,939
Scott: but I like his style.

434
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,885
Rym: I don't like his style.

435
00:30:59,147 --> 00:30:59,871
Rym: I want to know more about.

436
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:07,336
Scott: he's got three crunchyroll points and next time someone says yeah that shit is shallow I'm gonna say if you want something deep go to the bottom of well or watch cowboy bebop.

437
00:31:09,162 --> 00:31:13,477
Scott: and if someone says you know if I'm gonna if something is deep I'll be like man that shit's deep like a.

438
00:31:13,518 --> 00:31:23,736
Rym: well so yeah whoo sir I think the reviews were more entertaining than the show characters ever.

439
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,808
Scott: the clip with the bass playing yeah that was fine.

440
00:31:25,828 --> 00:31:27,096
Scott: to find that on YouTube I will.

441
00:31:27,116 --> 00:31:28,364
Rym: I'll try to link to it if I can fire.

442
00:31:28,384 --> 00:31:34,723
Scott: we can remember which of the episodes in crunchyroll it is that we can watch just that one episode and once you get past the part with the bass playing you can end.
