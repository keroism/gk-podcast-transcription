1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,200
Rym: It's Tuesday November 15th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:38,474
Rym: so uh Mario Kart came out today Mario and That's all we've been doing since we got it Mario.

3
00:00:40,181 --> 00:00:40,843
Scott: Yeah,

4
00:00:41,103 --> 00:00:56,963
Rym: and uh it's video game day coincidentally enough, so we're gonna talk about Mario Kart, but we're gonna try to hold out and talk about anything else and We'll see how long it takes before we end up just talking about Mario Kart anyway,

5
00:00:57,204 --> 00:01:03,865
Scott: so so start your timer and Yeah, it's not gonna last very long at all.

6
00:01:04,308 --> 00:01:08,602
Scott: I mean It's it's hard enough trying not to talk about it any second.

7
00:01:08,642 --> 00:01:10,369
Scott: I could just stop podcasting and go play.

8
00:01:11,031 --> 00:01:13,781
Rym: Yeah, even though we can't play online, but we'll get to that.

9
00:01:14,022 --> 00:01:15,085
Scott: Yeah, all right.

10
00:01:15,286 --> 00:01:15,768
Scott: Oh my god.

11
00:01:15,808 --> 00:01:16,470
Scott: We talked about it.

12
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:17,988
Scott: We couldn't hold out for more than two seconds.

13
00:01:20,058 --> 00:01:23,584
Rym: So anyway Did you go to a GameStop to get this?

14
00:01:23,826 --> 00:01:32,132
Scott: I went to a GameStop And you didn't go to that GameStop though not the horrible GameStop in the mall near us with the with the angry girl in it The.

15
00:01:32,313 --> 00:01:34,930
Scott: I went to the good GameStop in the city, and it is a good GameStop.

16
00:01:35,091 --> 00:01:39,250
Scott: But I made the mistake of going during lunch, and it was kind of busy.

17
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:43,850
Scott: Well that was my first trip there, and they called me last night and said it'll be there afternoon.

18
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:46,441
Scott: So I went at like 12 31.

19
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:46,884
Rym: wait a minute.

20
00:01:46,904 --> 00:01:48,472
Rym: you went at 12 31.

21
00:01:48,472 --> 00:01:51,121
Scott: No no no no 12. between 12 30 and 1.

22
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:53,671
Rym: you realize afternoon goes all the way until about 4.

23
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:55,724
Scott: Yeah, I know, but they said they didn't say afternoon.

24
00:01:55,764 --> 00:01:56,730
Scott: They said afternoon.

25
00:01:58,255 --> 00:01:59,889
Rym: Did they say the words afternoon?

26
00:02:00,816 --> 00:02:01,529
Scott: It was two words.

27
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,019
Rym: Okay, I'll just take your word on it.

28
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:07,310
Scott: They didn't say you can come pick it up in the afternoon.

29
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,509
Scott: They said you can come pick it up any time afternoon, and you trusted them.

30
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:17,630
Scott: well No, actually I didn't trust them, but that was the only time I figured.

31
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:23,894
Scott: You know I want to get it as soon as possible, and that was my opportunity to leave work, so hey I went to check.

32
00:02:24,316 --> 00:02:26,485
Scott: huh it was better than sitting in my office doing nothing.

33
00:02:26,525 --> 00:02:28,489
Scott: so of course It wasn't there.

34
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,316
Scott: But I you know it pissed me off.

35
00:02:30,497 --> 00:02:36,270
Scott: not that it wasn't there because I kind of expected it to not be there that yet Because you know UPS or whatever always sucks.

36
00:02:36,732 --> 00:02:39,786
Scott: I mean half the time I've ever gone to pick up a pre-ordered thing.

37
00:02:39,866 --> 00:02:41,543
Scott: on the day it comes out It's just not there.

38
00:02:41,584 --> 00:02:43,678
Scott: yet It happens all the time.

39
00:02:43,779 --> 00:02:45,409
Rym: You know I've learned to just wait one day.

40
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:48,295
Scott: Yeah, but I couldn't wait one day for this And I'm glad I didn't.

41
00:02:48,356 --> 00:02:58,810
Rym: but or I just tell you to buy it And then if it's there you spend the time and buy it for me And if it's not there I caused any time when I went back after work at like 4 30 to go get it.

42
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,400
Scott: There was no one in the store, and I just picked it up.

43
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,377
Rym: Yeah after I wasted all that time I didn't waste any more time.

44
00:03:03,578 --> 00:03:05,628
Scott: well the point is is that it kind of pisses me off.

45
00:03:05,688 --> 00:03:21,905
Scott: is that With barely you know not a large amount of money or effort Gamestop can make a system where you go online and you see the exact stock of every game stop And you see the exact hour and minute when things are going to arrive in what quantity.

46
00:03:22,487 --> 00:03:23,430
Rym: you know why they don't do that?

47
00:03:24,214 --> 00:03:27,090
Rym: Because people like us are actually not their primary customer.

48
00:03:27,845 --> 00:03:30,420
Scott: Yeah But the point is is that there's a whole lot of people.

49
00:03:30,782 --> 00:03:32,550
Scott: half there was a big long line at noon.

50
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:37,927
Scott: Half the people in that line were there for non for something else besides just buying a game.

51
00:03:37,987 --> 00:03:40,036
Scott: they were pre-ordering They were doing something weird.

52
00:03:40,076 --> 00:03:41,966
Scott: They were selling back something, and you know what.

53
00:03:42,006 --> 00:03:42,529
Rym: you know what if?

54
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:49,570
Rym: Everyone who was standing around stayed no matter how long the way it was then they have no incentive.

55
00:03:49,891 --> 00:03:51,037
Scott: Well some people were leaving.

56
00:03:51,298 --> 00:04:00,588
Scott: the thing is is that the way they keep a lot of The the customers from leaving is they only have one guy at the register and everyone else is a salesman who tries to keep you from leaving.

57
00:04:02,418 --> 00:04:12,029
Scott: But anyway Just bothers me when someone could do something that would benefit them and others very easily By using computers and things and they just don't do it.

58
00:04:12,932 --> 00:04:16,310
Rym: See I I don't think it really would benefit them that much monetarily.

59
00:04:16,652 --> 00:04:28,669
Scott: I think it would benefit them a whole lot because if you're go online And you know for sure that this minute they get that game stop down the road has what you want You'll go over there and grab it and you'll start doing that instead of going to the EV.

60
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:37,457
Scott: well I guess they're the same company now, but you'll you know as opposed to some other store You're sure that the game stop has it and you go online And but you just went back to the game.

61
00:04:37,517 --> 00:04:38,260
Rym: same game stop.

62
00:04:38,281 --> 00:04:39,084
Rym: that didn't have it before.

63
00:04:39,164 --> 00:04:40,370
Scott: I had already pre-ordered the game.

64
00:04:40,611 --> 00:04:43,569
Scott: Oh, oh, oh, but that's that's not the point.

65
00:04:45,111 --> 00:04:47,781
Scott: Yeah, whatever the point thing about this right now.

66
00:04:47,901 --> 00:04:50,210
Scott: I'm not really super loyal to any game store.

67
00:04:50,310 --> 00:05:07,310
Scott: I go wherever I is convenient right, but if GameStop implemented something like that or EB Influented something like that, and I'm kind of anti-eb right now I would just go there exclusively because I could always be sure that it's not gonna be a wasted trip all right.

68
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:09,774
Rym: So what's this I hear about?

69
00:05:09,794 --> 00:05:18,069
Scott: the Marines got a new weapon so they got this weapon in Iraq, and it's a thermal barrack in nature.

70
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:31,130
Scott: Apparently it's a shoulder-mounted sort of rocket thing with a warhead shoulder-mounted assault weapon right Is described as it as ne novel explosives?

71
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:37,830
Scott: Aha, it's a thermal barrack chemical thing which I don't know enough about because I'm not sciency enough.

72
00:05:38,753 --> 00:05:45,752
Scott: But it ignites the air and then produces a shockwave of unparalleled destructive power Unparalleled.

73
00:05:46,615 --> 00:05:47,938
Scott: and they see some pictures here.

74
00:05:48,179 --> 00:06:07,989
Scott: They shoot this rocket at this brick square building right and The rocket goes into the building it blows up All right, and the explosion is kind of big and knocked the roof off right, but then there's this shockwave and What's left from four solid brick walls with a window in a doorway is?

75
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:12,697
Scott: Just a pile of bricks One rocket shoulder-mounted.

76
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:13,340
Rym: Well.

77
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,526
Rym: You know that's what you get when you spend Orders of magnitude more money than every other nation in the world combined.

78
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:23,322
Scott: on your military Yeah, but usually you know military stuff is pretty crappy.

79
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:24,346
Scott: This is pretty good.

80
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:26,410
Rym: Uh Don't you remember site?

81
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,502
Rym: Yet say and all those things it don't site was the prototype now.

82
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:32,304
Rym: It's called something else.

83
00:06:32,324 --> 00:06:36,093
Scott: It's called something warrior something It's just all.

84
00:06:36,153 --> 00:06:43,289
Scott: all site is is like it's a gun and a whole computer wearable computer combat suit thing.

85
00:06:44,232 --> 00:06:46,018
Scott: Yeah, this is just a badass rocket.

86
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:52,089
Scott: That's really useful because you can frickin you know if there's a building Let's say there's a bunch of guys in a building shooting out the windows at you.

87
00:06:52,593 --> 00:06:54,689
Scott: You shoot one of these things and they're building falls down.

88
00:06:55,571 --> 00:06:56,618
Rym: Yeah, but we're the u.s..

89
00:06:56,658 --> 00:07:01,658
Scott: We just send an airstrike or something Sometimes, but I think they're actually gonna use this.

90
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:07,670
Scott: they are actually using it right now in Iraq all the time apparently Uh-huh like they just got it shipped in and now they're using it.

91
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:14,530
Rym: Yeah, cuz uh the thing we need to be doing right now is destroying more buildings over there You know winning the hearts and minds of the population.

92
00:07:16,571 --> 00:07:18,905
Scott: It's a cool weapon despite the bad uses.

93
00:07:18,945 --> 00:07:26,590
Rym: yeah, yeah, I know I can't deny it because I got to say whenever I see a new fighter jet I always go It looks cool, and it's fast.

94
00:07:30,273 --> 00:07:30,955
Rym: No you don't.

95
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:40,844
Rym: I live next to friggin Selfridge Air National Guard base for most of my childhood and The first time an f-16 flew over it was awesome the seven thousandth time.

96
00:07:40,864 --> 00:07:46,190
Scott: I wanted to throw a baseball at it Yeah, but but I didn't live next to an Air Force Base.

97
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:57,366
Scott: And when I go to a sporting event and they have the flyover at the International Anthem is wicked cool every now And then they'd like break windows because they'd release the afterburner or something over a neighborhood geniuses.

98
00:07:58,671 --> 00:08:01,605
Scott: Yeah, at least it's less damaged than a thermobaric rocket.

99
00:08:01,806 --> 00:08:02,228
Scott: Haha.

100
00:08:03,713 --> 00:08:08,697
Rym: So uh Mario Amazon Amazon is doing something kind of cool.

101
00:08:08,717 --> 00:08:13,882
Rym: I mean Amazon generally is kind of on top of this whole internet business thing.

102
00:08:14,223 --> 00:08:20,586
Scott: yeah considering how profitable they are you know normally You know you think that someone big and profitable like Amazon kind of evil.

103
00:08:20,646 --> 00:08:21,670
Scott: no they're kind of normal.

104
00:08:21,891 --> 00:08:23,035
Scott: I'm neutral on Amazon.

105
00:08:23,155 --> 00:08:24,681
Scott: I buy stuff from them when it's good.

106
00:08:24,862 --> 00:08:27,010
Rym: Yeah, well now they're trying to implement tagging.

107
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,802
Scott: Alright, so now it'll be that much easier to find stuff.

108
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:34,054
Rym: Yeah, and it's just a prototype System right now.

109
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:39,909
Rym: It's kind of a beta and they're letting about half their users see the tags Just so they can experiment and screw around with them.

110
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:42,097
Rym: I have no idea what the criteria are.

111
00:08:42,116 --> 00:08:49,623
Rym: so uh if you have an Amazon account, and you log in you might see these tags And they're changing all the time, and they're not sure what they're gonna do with it yet.

112
00:08:50,145 --> 00:08:50,326
Scott: hmm.

113
00:08:50,627 --> 00:08:51,170
Scott: It's pretty cool.

114
00:08:51,391 --> 00:08:53,338
Scott: I'd go around Amazon tag and some stuff.

115
00:08:54,021 --> 00:09:02,828
Scott: You know people can come up with tags to be like Maybe kind of replace the the semi not so useful wish list thing you know.

116
00:09:02,969 --> 00:09:12,410
Scott: yeah You set up some tags like these are the cool Somethings, and then you can have a page that you know for the tag that lists all those things and then share it with people.

117
00:09:12,631 --> 00:09:17,573
Rym: Maybe this will be a prime opportunity for us to try to push our flimflam tag.

118
00:09:17,874 --> 00:09:19,539
Scott: flimflam tag is a good idea.

119
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:25,822
Scott: I just I See people marking things as flimflam that aren't is the only problem.

120
00:09:26,183 --> 00:09:27,689
Scott: Yeah, there's nothing you could do about it.

121
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,393
Rym: I gotta try we gotta try.

122
00:09:30,974 --> 00:09:47,300
Rym: plus one of the cool things is a lot of non geeks use Amazon and they'll see tags and Amazon will probably explain tags in a way that they'll understand and It'll make tagging hopefully a more Accepted technology, maybe people start finding the delicious.

123
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,995
Scott: a lot of people are using the tags on Flickr and stuff And they know what they're doing.

124
00:09:51,538 --> 00:09:55,737
Rym: Yeah, those are generally more geeky people Generally, but you'd be surprised.

125
00:09:56,539 --> 00:09:58,205
Rym: I think Amazon could be the tipping point.

126
00:09:58,987 --> 00:10:08,483
Scott: might be You know, but I don't think that a lot of people are gonna go through the effort of tagging things And you know they're not gonna get the full power out of the tagging.

127
00:10:08,503 --> 00:10:09,426
Scott: They're gonna kind of.

128
00:10:09,446 --> 00:10:12,088
Rym: oh We could talk about our things of the day.

129
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:14,539
Scott: Yes, I knew you forgot something.

130
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:17,389
Scott: look at you not holding out you druggy.

131
00:10:19,155 --> 00:10:19,882
Rym: my thing of the day.

132
00:10:19,902 --> 00:10:37,695
Rym: I ran into a Picture that someone made and what they had done is they took every single Playboy centerfold for like a decade and they mathematically averaged all the images and the resulting image is Kind of neat looking.

133
00:10:37,715 --> 00:10:39,042
Rym: that's all I got.

134
00:10:39,062 --> 00:10:40,570
Scott: It just looks like this fleshy blob.

135
00:10:41,051 --> 00:10:48,089
Rym: Yeah, the fun of the one thing I noticed is that you can very clearly see in this amalgam image some thighs.

136
00:10:49,034 --> 00:10:52,529
Rym: It looks like generally the women are always standing in the same position in the picture.

137
00:10:53,432 --> 00:10:54,436
Scott: Yeah, you know what else you can see.

138
00:10:54,456 --> 00:10:57,267
Scott: you can kind of see this kind of little shadow of cleavage.

139
00:10:57,729 --> 00:11:00,720
Scott: Yeah I wonder what uh this blob of hair.

140
00:11:01,443 --> 00:11:08,405
Rym: I wonder what photographic elements the Playboy photographers were focusing on when they decided to set these centerfolds up.

141
00:11:08,425 --> 00:11:11,396
Scott: All right, so my thing of the day Oh my god.

142
00:11:11,597 --> 00:11:13,104
Scott: when I found this it was on.

143
00:11:13,185 --> 00:11:14,290
Scott: it was on the anime news network.

144
00:11:14,431 --> 00:11:21,725
Scott: I was just like rolling around the office practically Aha, so, you know the Ozumanga dial guy.

145
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:22,387
Scott: What's his name?

146
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:23,130
Rym: Azuma?

147
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:28,630
Scott: Yeah, his last name's Ozuma or his first name cuz it's Japan and they say the names backwards, right?

148
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:39,950
Scott: So he makes the Ozumanga dial which is pretty hilarious and he also makes the yotsuba which is his current Awesome, and it's it's equal if not more awesome.

149
00:11:40,511 --> 00:11:41,655
Scott: But he's.

150
00:11:42,016 --> 00:11:45,710
Scott: there's a site with I think it's by him or by a crazy fan.

151
00:11:46,091 --> 00:11:48,702
Scott: It's a Japanese site so I can't read it and I can't know.

152
00:11:48,782 --> 00:11:58,293
Scott: but it's got a bunch of flash Animations that are all with his stuff and one of them was the opener to Ozumanga dial.

153
00:11:58,454 --> 00:12:07,449
Scott: but he replaced all the characters with yotsuba characters and yotsuba things and it's The hilarious if you know what those things are.

154
00:12:08,554 --> 00:12:11,413
Rym: And if you don't know what those things are Find out.

155
00:12:11,734 --> 00:12:12,698
Scott: Yeah, or else you suck.

156
00:12:12,878 --> 00:12:16,070
Rym: I imagine we'll talk about them on one of our anime podcasts.

157
00:12:16,752 --> 00:12:17,635
Scott: We definitely should.

158
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:27,385
Scott: there's a manga and an anime of Ozumanga dial and there's just a manga of yotsuba But it's coming out really quick and I imagine there will be an anime about it eventually.

159
00:12:27,425 --> 00:12:28,148
Scott: Maybe one day.

160
00:12:28,168 --> 00:12:28,770
Scott: I hope there is.

161
00:12:29,812 --> 00:12:30,697
Rym: So Mario Kart.

162
00:12:31,401 --> 00:12:32,849
Rym: Oh my god video game day.

163
00:12:33,413 --> 00:12:35,550
Rym: Mario Kart is fantastic.

164
00:12:36,896 --> 00:12:49,770
Scott: You know, I Before I played this Mario Kart, you know GBA Mario Kart was was the best because he unlike the other Mario karts Which are pretty much as random the computer cheats and items mean everything.

165
00:12:51,553 --> 00:12:54,767
Scott: The the Game Boy one was actually racing was the most important.

166
00:12:54,887 --> 00:12:58,020
Scott: if you raced Well, it didn't matter what items came up.

167
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:02,013
Scott: you won, right the ds1 It's.

168
00:13:02,396 --> 00:13:08,824
Scott: they subtracted that a little bit But they fixed it because the items don't do as much damage.

169
00:13:08,844 --> 00:13:17,733
Scott: you get hit by a shell you recover a lot quicker You know, so you can't avoid the shells anymore, but you recover and It's really good.

170
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:22,008
Scott: It's better than the GameCube one or the n64 one or anything.

171
00:13:22,128 --> 00:13:31,357
Rym: Oh my god See I've got really no reference because the last one I played was for the Super Nintendo and I had no interest in the franchise for a long time and This game is awesome.

172
00:13:31,539 --> 00:13:32,727
Rym: I really I can't deny it.

173
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:37,510
Rym: Yeah, it's Well, it's a Mario Kart game.

174
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:43,872
Rym: So, you know you pick a you pick a character you pick a car and then you race and you throw things at each other Mm-hmm.

175
00:13:43,932 --> 00:13:45,759
Scott: They got a lot of good track selection.

176
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,449
Scott: So my good tracks from the Game Boy one are in there.

177
00:13:49,212 --> 00:13:55,308
Scott: You know, they the new tracks are really high quality, especially the the Waluigi pinball.

178
00:13:55,328 --> 00:13:57,616
Scott: Yeah Yeah, freaking speed tube.

179
00:13:58,057 --> 00:13:58,579
Scott: What are?

180
00:13:58,599 --> 00:13:59,583
Scott: the tracks are really good.

181
00:13:59,603 --> 00:14:01,730
Rym: I like Delfino Plaza myself.

182
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:04,598
Rym: A long drift around that fountain.

183
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:07,124
Scott: the new rainbow road is alright, but it's not.

184
00:14:07,184 --> 00:14:16,597
Scott: it's easier than previous rainbow roads But it's not easier than previous rainbow roads if you want to really turn up the speed Which it's a good balance.

185
00:14:16,818 --> 00:14:17,139
Rym: Of course.

186
00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:19,870
Rym: The main thing about this game is that one because it's on the DS.

187
00:14:20,632 --> 00:14:21,354
Rym: It's wireless.

188
00:14:21,816 --> 00:14:26,690
Rym: So you can just play with eight people in one room and all race.

189
00:14:27,253 --> 00:14:32,700
Scott: you could do that for people with the Game Boy, but It was terrible to sit near each other.

190
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,403
Scott: with the cables.

191
00:14:33,483 --> 00:14:35,470
Rym: you sit near you mean hunch over each other.

192
00:14:35,551 --> 00:14:38,590
Scott: Those cables were like four feet and you can play with eight people on the GameCube.

193
00:14:38,731 --> 00:14:42,730
Scott: But you needed two GameCubes and two TVs and two land adapters and a wire.

194
00:14:42,951 --> 00:14:43,914
Rym: No one has that.

195
00:14:44,215 --> 00:14:47,044
Rym: people have it but not no one no one in the world.

196
00:14:47,646 --> 00:14:48,749
Scott: There are people but not many.

197
00:14:50,331 --> 00:14:54,790
Rym: Now the main thing about it is that this is not just Mario Kart.

198
00:14:54,911 --> 00:14:58,830
Rym: This is kind of the launch of the Nintendo DS Wi-Fi.

199
00:14:59,051 --> 00:15:06,418
Scott: Well, there was also Tony Hawk skater land Oh SK the number eight Erland is also using the Wi-Fi.

200
00:15:06,478 --> 00:15:08,205
Rym: Yeah, cuz that's gonna be a fantastic game.

201
00:15:08,526 --> 00:15:14,275
Scott: It's oh my god It's out now, but and kids are playing it, but not me Don't catch me with that.

202
00:15:14,617 --> 00:15:14,858
Scott: Now.

203
00:15:15,461 --> 00:15:19,294
Rym: We actually got to play some of the online and It's perfect.

204
00:15:19,334 --> 00:15:20,118
Rym: There's no lag.

205
00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:21,243
Rym: It just works.

206
00:15:21,825 --> 00:15:22,770
Scott: It just works.

207
00:15:23,011 --> 00:15:25,923
Scott: The only thing is you can't drag items around other than that.

208
00:15:26,084 --> 00:15:27,590
Scott: Oh and you can only play with four players.

209
00:15:27,871 --> 00:15:29,738
Scott: Yeah, but other than that, it's flawless.

210
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:30,361
Rym: Yep.

211
00:15:30,401 --> 00:15:32,630
Rym: You can play with anyone you've ever played with locally.

212
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:39,514
Rym: It saves a little key a little friend code and you can always play with those people anywhere As long as they're online.

213
00:15:39,534 --> 00:15:40,157
Rym: and you're online.

214
00:15:40,238 --> 00:15:43,552
Scott: you can always type in friend codes to people that you know You talk to.

215
00:15:43,752 --> 00:15:46,079
Rym: yep, and our friend codes will be in our forum.

216
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,670
Scott: Yep, or somewhere else maybe in the comments probably everywhere.

217
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:56,535
Scott: Yeah, so if you got the Mario Kart, you know put up your friend codes and you know We'll give you ours.

218
00:15:56,575 --> 00:15:59,388
Rym: you give us your will lay down some blue sparks bitches.

219
00:16:00,951 --> 00:16:12,770
Rym: There is a problem though the Wi-Fi online play and we're really not sure at this point What is wrong, but it is well known that it's not currently working.

220
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:18,970
Rym: So well, if you actually find someone and connect to them is fantastic, but half the time it just craps out before it connects to anyone.

221
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:22,608
Scott: Yeah, well you see before it was the game was released.

222
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:37,089
Scott: today People who had preview editions of the game were playing and they only reported Problems when they had a bunch of people in the same room on one access point Which is what they had because they were going to Nintendo and doing this, you know with a whole bunch of press people.

223
00:16:38,153 --> 00:16:46,090
Scott: but The problem if you go to the Nintendo Wi-Fi site today, it says there's a message that Mario Kart has like intermittent issues.

224
00:16:47,304 --> 00:16:49,082
Rym: so We don't know.

225
00:16:49,102 --> 00:17:04,634
Scott: yeah so what happens is if you try to play without friend codes if you try to just play worldwide or regional or Rival mode you sit there waiting for quite a while for anyone to join and usually no one joins and You don't find any opponents.

226
00:17:05,517 --> 00:17:11,776
Scott: I imagine that'll be fixed pretty soon should be fixed soon, but if you find opponents Most of the time what happens.

227
00:17:11,836 --> 00:17:18,323
Scott: is you get like it just cancels out and you get this error Instead of starting to play the game like error eight.

228
00:17:18,423 --> 00:17:18,986
Rym: Haha.

229
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:20,010
Rym: I am error.

230
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:23,488
Scott: Should I talk to Riverman?

231
00:17:24,951 --> 00:17:27,509
Scott: Bagu knows the way Bagu lives in the woods.

232
00:17:28,393 --> 00:17:32,167
Scott: Does he play Mario Kart because I could play with him even though he's in the middle of the woods?

233
00:17:32,207 --> 00:17:36,744
Rym: if he's got a wireless Access point I should log into high space and see who has some friend code.

234
00:17:36,785 --> 00:17:38,069
Scott: What's Bagu's friend code?

235
00:17:38,873 --> 00:17:47,127
Scott: Dangerous Yeah, but the online play is great, oh, there's a few tracks missing from online play, but whatever.

236
00:17:47,147 --> 00:18:00,863
Rym: yeah Yeah This game is probably the turning point as not really the turning point of the DS being awesome But the turning point as in I'm not going to play any system But my DS for probably the next month or two.

237
00:18:00,883 --> 00:18:03,577
Scott: Yeah, I'm Stupid.

238
00:18:03,617 --> 00:18:06,036
Scott: trauma center is the only DS game I got that haven't beat.

239
00:18:06,116 --> 00:18:08,410
Scott: cuz I'm on a really hard mission surgery.

240
00:18:08,451 --> 00:18:11,982
Scott: Yeah but Mario Kart basically killed any chances of that being fixed.

241
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:19,190
Scott: cuz now I've got to get a gold and An S super rank and every single Grand Prix on every single CC rating.

242
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:21,396
Rym: I'm very happy that just before it came out.

243
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,600
Rym: I finally beat, Castlevania.

244
00:18:23,242 --> 00:18:24,706
Rym: Yeah got it out of my system.

245
00:18:24,726 --> 00:18:25,629
Rym: Dracula's dead again.

246
00:18:27,051 --> 00:18:28,216
Scott: Why doesn't he just stay dead?

247
00:18:28,236 --> 00:18:30,665
Rym: Honestly, it wasn't really Dracula at the end.

248
00:18:31,307 --> 00:18:38,250
Rym: Oh The end is dumb, but it's dumb in the way that all modern Castlevania game endings are dumb.

249
00:18:39,471 --> 00:18:41,524
Scott: All right, as long as it was fun to play.

250
00:18:41,544 --> 00:18:42,329
Scott: who cares with the ending?

251
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:48,030
Scott: I haven't been good game endings in like forever and the last boss is kind of a challenge.

252
00:18:48,531 --> 00:18:52,863
Scott: That's always good because I don't think the last boss and Mario Kart's gonna be a challenge.

253
00:18:53,545 --> 00:18:55,410
Rym: Oh you mean uh me the internet.

254
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,986
Rym: Oh You know what the boss and Mario Kart is.

255
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:04,749
Rym: the one Japanese kid who got the game the day it came out has been playing non-stop ever since with an IV.

256
00:19:05,652 --> 00:19:10,093
Scott: You know if I play against that kid, I'm just gonna be like shit my pants Great.

257
00:19:10,213 --> 00:19:13,068
Scott: Hopefully I'll get like 20 bike shells and I'll have a chance of winning.

258
00:19:16,651 --> 00:19:20,869
Rym: We done about Mario Kart, oh, yeah, I think we got it out of our system till we play some more.

259
00:19:21,851 --> 00:19:27,777
Rym: but uh if you haven't gotten a DS yet and You're on the fence It's done.

260
00:19:27,797 --> 00:19:29,109
Rym: It is now the time to buy one.

261
00:19:29,872 --> 00:19:31,016
Scott: Yeah, you really can't.

262
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,629
Scott: I don't see any other better way to spend video game money.

263
00:19:35,532 --> 00:19:36,696
Rym: I mean the DS.

264
00:19:36,817 --> 00:19:40,008
Rym: the DS stands alone as a primary console.

265
00:19:40,048 --> 00:19:43,149
Rym: at this point You could have just a DS and be just fine.

266
00:19:43,952 --> 00:19:56,687
Scott: Yeah, I mean the other consoles are kind of dwindling and even though the Xbox 360 is coming next week or this week or whenever It's mostly sports games, so unless you're a sports game nut just get DS.

267
00:19:56,968 --> 00:19:58,326
Scott: Yeah Yeah.

268
00:19:59,392 --> 00:20:01,980
Scott: So the other game that we we rediscover.

269
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:05,610
Scott: well, I knew about this game for a long time, but I never really got into it.

270
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,510
Scott: Yeah, and we rediscovered it during our emulator.

271
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,920
Scott: It's called mule m?

272
00:20:11,302 --> 00:20:13,330
Scott: u le with dots in between.

273
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:18,585
Rym: Yeah, it stands for multiple use labor element equipment equipment.

274
00:20:18,605 --> 00:20:19,748
Rym: I thought it was element.

275
00:20:19,849 --> 00:20:23,817
Scott: No equipment Basically, we realized.

276
00:20:23,898 --> 00:20:24,219
Scott: I don't know.

277
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:25,523
Scott: I didn't realize it before it.

278
00:20:25,704 --> 00:20:28,851
Scott: It's a German board game for a Computer.

279
00:20:29,293 --> 00:20:31,201
Rym: it's kind of an old-school German board game.

280
00:20:31,342 --> 00:20:35,209
Rym: in that it's a good solid game But there is kind of a lot of randomness.

281
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:40,610
Scott: There's a little bit too much randomness, and I'm trying to figure out a way to design to redesign the game.

282
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:43,644
Scott: We're a little less randomness, but it's hard because the game itself is solid.

283
00:20:43,945 --> 00:20:44,970
Rym: It's actually really cool.

284
00:20:45,231 --> 00:20:48,823
Rym: You're uh well, there's a plot and a story, but forget all that.

285
00:20:49,486 --> 00:20:50,710
Scott: so basically you're four dudes.

286
00:20:50,891 --> 00:21:02,398
Rym: there's four dudes, and you're one of them and You get plots of land that you develop and on those plots of land you can produce one of a number of commodities and some Commodities are useful for different things.

287
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:08,564
Rym: one commodity is only useful for selling to make money And at the end of the game wherever the highest net worth wins.

288
00:21:09,207 --> 00:21:17,510
Scott: yep There's some things about the game that are kind of tricky But it's because of the nature of it being a really really really old game.

289
00:21:18,004 --> 00:21:29,510
Rym: Yeah Like getting your plots of land there this box goes to each plot of land and whoever hits their button first gets that plot of Land, but it goes real fast, and it's pretty much a crapshoot.

290
00:21:30,511 --> 00:21:37,390
Scott: Yeah, I mean you can practice a lot and try to get the really good plots of land adjacent to each other for max bonuses.

291
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:54,472
Rym: but Yeah, it kind of detracts from the German board game this of it not any more than the random random-ass events like oh Pirates came and stole everything or a meteor just destroyed one of your plots of land or oh a monster came and ate all your Food.

292
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,240
Rym: ah that stupid monster.

293
00:21:56,562 --> 00:21:57,928
Scott: Yeah, the monster is pretty scary.

294
00:21:59,592 --> 00:22:04,209
Scott: But you know German board games have things like that, but at least when they're in a German board game.

295
00:22:04,551 --> 00:22:06,059
Scott: Technically they're.

296
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:06,380
Scott: they're like.

297
00:22:06,421 --> 00:22:07,184
Scott: you know they're coming.

298
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:12,094
Scott: it's like Kind of like in settlers the robber can happen But you know

299
00:22:12,134 --> 00:22:14,062
Rym: there is a way to protect yourself from the Rob

300
00:22:14,122 --> 00:22:18,537
Scott: and you know about the robber and you can Predict him and prevent him and there is

301
00:22:18,577 --> 00:22:22,489
Rym: no way to predict prepare or deal with any disaster in mule.

302
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:27,933
Scott: yeah They're just completely random like oh no way makes it more like a simulation of real-life Economics.

303
00:22:28,274 --> 00:22:31,305
Rym: you get randomly fucked by the world and there's nothing you can do about it.

304
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:34,877
Scott: It's true however It's a little more random than real life.

305
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,530
Scott: I mean you pretty much win at gambling every day.

306
00:22:38,992 --> 00:22:42,890
Scott: Yeah, how do you win at gambling every single time because that's a game mechanic?

307
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,982
Rym: Yeah to reward you for taking your turn quicker.

308
00:22:46,002 --> 00:22:49,905
Scott: It is that's good But it seems like you know you can't get over.

309
00:22:49,926 --> 00:22:50,430
Rym: see the main.

310
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:58,870
Rym: I mean the main part of the game is making commodities, and you make them one of the different commodities And then you bid and the bidding is kind of cool.

311
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:12,740
Rym: you say if you're a buyer or a seller for each commodity and then all the buyers stand at the bottom and all the sellers stand at the top of the screen and Then you it says go and you move your little guy And you stop at whatever point you decide it would be valid.

312
00:23:12,841 --> 00:23:17,777
Rym: you would want to buy or sell and whenever two of these lines Intersect the transaction occurs,

313
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:33,973
Scott: so if I'm a buyer, and I'm willing to pay $50 per unit of Energy and Rym is willing to see is trying to sell his energy You know let's say he walks down a bit, and he stops at like $100 and I stop at $50.

314
00:23:33,973 --> 00:23:35,909
Scott: He's standing there looking at each other and nothing happens.

315
00:23:36,511 --> 00:23:46,370
Scott: Then someone caves in and walks over and touches the other guy and say Rym walks down and touches my line And he'll sell me one unit of whatever 50 bucks.

316
00:23:46,993 --> 00:23:54,730
Rym: Or there's always the hilarity of say I've got the only energy left in the game And there's none left in like the store because there's a store, but sometimes it runs out of stuff.

317
00:23:55,052 --> 00:24:01,829
Rym: yeah, because the store is only filled by the players and Everyone else needs energy, and they're trying to bid on it.

318
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:05,449
Rym: But I won't sell it and the price just keeps going up.

319
00:24:06,313 --> 00:24:16,768
Scott: And then if you have a partner who's down low on the buying side He just keeps walking up and up and up and that forces other players who want it more to keep going up and up And up even if he doesn't really want it.

320
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:28,406
Scott: Yeah, you can definitely play apples and oranges and collude with people And then at the last second when You know someone when the time is about to run out on the auction you walk down.

321
00:24:28,446 --> 00:24:29,290
Scott: the other guy walks up.

322
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:34,892
Scott: Oh, you sold him one energy for like $2,000.

323
00:24:34,892 --> 00:24:38,230
Rym: The biggest problem we had with the game was that we weren't sure how to win at first.

324
00:24:38,331 --> 00:24:40,310
Rym: We weren't sure how many points anything was worth.

325
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,430
Scott: We're still not really sure how many points things are worth.

326
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,029
Rym: Oh, I am now I finally figured it out.

327
00:24:44,415 --> 00:24:45,350
Scott: You figured out exactly?

328
00:24:46,292 --> 00:24:46,513
Rym: Most.

329
00:24:46,674 --> 00:24:48,930
Rym: the only thing I haven't figured out exactly is land.

330
00:24:49,271 --> 00:24:57,783
Rym: But it looks like land is just a base price plus the price of any mules you've put on it Plus the price of any equipment you've put on mules on it.

331
00:24:57,803 --> 00:24:59,449
Rym: Yeah, that's what it looks like.

332
00:24:59,991 --> 00:25:02,337
Rym: Okay, and goods are just the.

333
00:25:02,738 --> 00:25:07,610
Rym: you get a one point for each good times the value of that good at the end of the game.

334
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:10,068
Scott: How do you know what the value of the good is?

335
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:16,303
Rym: Whatever it sells for at the end of the game in the store in the store, or if it sells normally Whatever the price ends up at.

336
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,670
Scott: Yeah, all right, all right, that's okay.

337
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:29,729
Rym: But so by selling a good you'll drive the price down so that other people have to sell to get something from it.

338
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:37,129
Scott: Yeah But the idea is that you wanna you only want to sell a good if the price now is Higher than what it will be at the end of the game.

339
00:25:37,551 --> 00:25:43,030
Rym: Yeah, because there's no inherent value in having a good or having a money.

340
00:25:43,492 --> 00:25:46,464
Rym: You just want to have as much of everything as you can at the end.

341
00:25:47,067 --> 00:25:47,730
Scott: I get it now.

342
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:52,970
Scott: It's that's a lot of you because I was wondering it's like how much is this good gonna be worth at the end of?

343
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:55,910
Rym: Yeah, it's not nearly as complicated as we were making it out to be.

344
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:01,532
Scott: Yeah, it's like cuz I'd have like extra Smith or and I'd be like it would the price would be $50.

345
00:26:01,532 --> 00:26:02,702
Scott: I'd be like should I sell it for 50 or?

346
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:05,819
Scott: Will it be worth more than 50 at the end of the game?

347
00:26:05,879 --> 00:26:11,399
Scott: meaning selling it is dumb because you get one point for $1 Right, so I just you couldn't.

348
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,850
Scott: I couldn't make a decision because they didn't know how the game worked.

349
00:26:14,972 --> 00:26:16,584
Scott: But now that we kind of know how it works.

350
00:26:16,645 --> 00:26:17,249
Scott: It's a lot better.

351
00:26:17,692 --> 00:26:20,889
Rym: Yep, and if it were the bag we had Mario Kart, we'd probably play the game again.

352
00:26:21,494 --> 00:26:23,270
Scott: Yeah, we're probably play it again sometime.

353
00:26:23,451 --> 00:26:27,790
Scott: Anyway, if we can get maybe some four USB thingies we can do a little four score action.

354
00:26:28,294 --> 00:26:30,330
Rym: Yeah, I'd like to play with humans instead of computers.

355
00:26:30,681 --> 00:26:40,330
Scott: Yeah The thing is this game has been you know is real popular back in the day and it still has like the 80s Following but it hasn't been remade in a long long time.

356
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:43,159
Rym: We're gonna try to remake it at least at the very least.

357
00:26:43,239 --> 00:26:50,609
Scott: I'm gonna redesign it in a more German style fashion Without trying to destroy what makes the game great.

358
00:26:51,172 --> 00:26:56,074
Rym: See the game also has one other aspect that you can choose to ignore if you want But there's.

359
00:26:56,254 --> 00:27:01,490
Rym: each individual player has their value, but the colony as a whole as a value, too.

360
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,289
Rym: And There are kind of two games here.

361
00:27:04,532 --> 00:27:06,129
Rym: You want to be better than every other player?

362
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:11,410
Rym: But at the same time you want the colony as a whole to survive and it's not really such a big thing in the game.

363
00:27:11,912 --> 00:27:14,562
Rym: It talks about it like it'll say.

364
00:27:14,642 --> 00:27:16,630
Rym: Oh the colony failed and you all lose.

365
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:19,870
Scott: It's just some text at the bottom of the screen that has no effect on anything.

366
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:27,756
Rym: I think it should be if we remake it something more prominent like the colony can fail and then you all lose And I don't know cuz.

367
00:27:27,776 --> 00:27:34,457
Rym: then it's more of a you know tragedy of the commons prisoner's dilemma Getting in commodity if you could.

368
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:51,170
Scott: what would be good is if you set some sort of System where if the players don't Collectively do good enough So if one guy just bandits everyone else and the colony as a whole doesn't do well enough That it ends up just hurting people in the game.

369
00:27:52,031 --> 00:27:59,730
Scott: Well, I have to play around with it, yeah, like imagine if you're you're playing Kind of like that Lord of the Rings game, even though I don't like that.

370
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:04,610
Scott: I love that game where you know, it's like you have to put the tokens in to help everyone, you know.

371
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:12,169
Scott: But if you don't put the tokens in you might do better than everyone else, but Sauron moves closer Yeah, and it's kind of scary.

372
00:28:12,812 --> 00:28:16,968
Scott: Something like that where if not everyone contributes and makes enough

373
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:17,349
Rym: stuff

374
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,763
Scott: Then you know all the Smith or sucks

375
00:28:21,004 --> 00:28:30,062
Rym: kind of like in a Chrononauts where if everyone was real neglectful and too many cards were faced down The world ended and the game was over and you all lost.

376
00:28:30,183 --> 00:28:31,289
Scott: Yeah, that's a good way to put it.

377
00:28:31,931 --> 00:28:34,240
Scott: That's a lot better mechanic than just at the end of the game.

378
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,726
Scott: There's some text that means nothing.

379
00:28:35,866 --> 00:28:42,628
Rym: Yeah, it's just flavor Because the game was designed to be one of those edutainment games to teach children about supply and demand.

380
00:28:42,849 --> 00:28:50,970
Scott: Yep It was actually designed by this Guy who turned into a woman and there's like a whole story behind it and how she's dead.

381
00:28:51,791 --> 00:28:55,143
Rym: Yeah, the developers of this game have kind of a cult following.

382
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,010
Rym: It's cool and creepy at the same time.

383
00:28:57,391 --> 00:29:02,549
Scott: Yeah, and there's a version for the Atari a version for the Commodore a version for the NES.

384
00:29:02,931 --> 00:29:04,355
Rym: We found this DOS version.

385
00:29:04,556 --> 00:29:05,619
Scott: that was a remake.

386
00:29:05,639 --> 00:29:06,783
Scott: That was a clone remake.

387
00:29:06,823 --> 00:29:08,388
Rym: Yes a remake, but it's identical.

388
00:29:08,629 --> 00:29:09,974
Scott: Yeah Well, it's somewhat identity.

389
00:29:09,994 --> 00:29:11,319
Rym: The only difference is the graphics.

390
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,404
Rym: I looked yeah.

391
00:29:12,685 --> 00:29:13,649
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty good.

392
00:29:14,512 --> 00:29:16,358
Scott: But didn't they change the themes like under the water?

393
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,690
Rym: no, no that that was an xcom.

394
00:29:20,414 --> 00:29:21,842
Rym: XCOM 2 was underwater.

395
00:29:21,963 --> 00:29:25,150
Rym: XCOM 1 was on the land damn underwater.

396
00:29:26,256 --> 00:29:28,749
Rym: Nothing to do with mule underwater aliens.

397
00:29:30,112 --> 00:29:31,296
Scott: Don't like those underwater aliens.

398
00:29:31,999 --> 00:29:32,843
Rym: I didn't like XCOM 2.

399
00:29:32,843 --> 00:29:39,170
Rym: Yeah It was the same game only crappier and with worse graphics.

400
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:45,230
Scott: You know I like XCOM just so bad at it and it's so hard for me to do it for some reason that I don't play It's.

401
00:29:45,552 --> 00:29:50,490
Rym: not only was XCOM one of my favorite games ever, but XCOM was the first game I ever pirated.

402
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,237
Rym: I didn't even know I pirated it.

403
00:29:52,298 --> 00:29:55,110
Rym: Someone just gave me these discs and then there was a game on it.

404
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:58,743
Scott: I. the first X time I ever played was the demo of XCOM apocalypse.

405
00:29:58,844 --> 00:30:00,450
Scott: Oh god, it was okay.

406
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:04,722
Scott: But the the alien invasion one is obviously the best everyone knows.

407
00:30:05,183 --> 00:30:05,464
Rym: Yeah.

408
00:30:05,744 --> 00:30:07,609
Rym: I mean, it's an incredibly difficult game.

409
00:30:08,231 --> 00:30:12,185
Scott: Don't make no bones about it, but you know what honestly it's not as good as Mario Kart.

410
00:30:13,048 --> 00:30:16,049
Rym: Oh Mario Kart I really want to play it right now.

411
00:30:16,451 --> 00:30:22,577
Rym: I think I will cuz there's a chance that I'll run into some crazy crazy crazy kid from Japan Who's just good at it and it'll beat me.

412
00:30:22,597 --> 00:30:24,546
Scott: Maybe you'll have a really awesome emblem.

413
00:30:24,566 --> 00:30:25,490
Scott: That's just scary.

414
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,696
Rym: Yeah, you can't.

415
00:30:26,756 --> 00:30:29,250
Rym: I mean, you know Nintendo you can't talk in the game.

416
00:30:29,451 --> 00:30:38,863
Rym: There's almost no way to convey obscenities to other players except You can have a name and you know, they're going to be people named various things.

417
00:30:40,146 --> 00:30:47,890
Rym: Aha hockey jockey, man And you can actually draw a picture that will be on your car while you race.

418
00:30:48,032 --> 00:30:57,328
Scott: It's also floating above your head And it has the players name and a little thumbnail of what their picture is so you can know.

419
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:59,997
Scott: if you learn someone's picture You can see where they are on the track.

420
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:02,489
Rym: Yeah, like I ran the first guy ever raced online.

421
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:05,443
Rym: He had a little Yoshi egg and it had a little skull on it.

422
00:31:05,945 --> 00:31:06,508
Scott: That's pretty cool.

423
00:31:06,649 --> 00:31:12,650
Rym: Yeah We also found this program you can use to turn graphics and like make good icons.

424
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:18,590
Scott: Well, it's a website and you upload a JPEG or a gift to the website and it puts on the screen.

425
00:31:19,931 --> 00:31:21,517
Scott: You know basically they.

426
00:31:21,617 --> 00:31:29,369
Scott: it resizes and figures out the image into the same resolution as the emblem And then it's up to you to copy the emblem off the screen and onto your DS.

427
00:31:29,851 --> 00:31:34,170
Scott: You can just do that in the gimp if you want you could but this website does it really well.

428
00:31:34,411 --> 00:31:36,798
Scott: Yeah, it's not just a simple resize.

429
00:31:36,938 --> 00:31:37,380
Scott: It's still.

430
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:43,038
Rym: it's easier than making a spray for the old one based Natural selection counter-strike half-life.

431
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:46,730
Scott: Yeah, you know, what's actually surprising is steam now is really easy to make the sprays.

432
00:31:47,371 --> 00:31:48,917
Scott: Yeah added a whole spray thing.

433
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:53,587
Rym: See I never got to see that because I switched to Linux and Try as I might.

434
00:31:54,296 --> 00:31:55,490
Rym: Steam does not work in wine.

435
00:31:55,630 --> 00:32:04,889
Scott: Yeah, I I got to see it because I use steam and half-life 2 and I played it and even though I use Linux 99% of the time now, but I didn't use it because it didn't make a spray for it.

436
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,053
Rym: So I take that back.

437
00:32:06,374 --> 00:32:07,618
Rym: steam works just fine.

438
00:32:07,939 --> 00:32:09,383
Rym: The games in steam don't work.

439
00:32:09,724 --> 00:32:10,727
Scott: No, it's true.

440
00:32:10,788 --> 00:32:13,154
Scott: It's true Steam is great.

441
00:32:13,194 --> 00:32:14,821
Rym: Steam is just some windows and they open up.

442
00:32:14,922 --> 00:32:16,830
Rym: I mean, yeah, it's not hard to make that work.

443
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,356
Scott: It actually changed steam recently.

444
00:32:18,376 --> 00:32:21,289
Scott: I don't like it as much now, but what are you gonna do?

445
00:32:21,711 --> 00:32:25,150
Rym: If I get sick of Mario Kart, I might boot into Windows so I can play some natural selection.

446
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,216
Scott: I played natural selection once the other day.

447
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:27,897
Scott: It was pretty good.

448
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,490
Rym: I got to say natural selection is probably my favorite.

449
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:38,050
Rym: I guess new era or like this current era of FPS is online.

450
00:32:38,471 --> 00:32:46,929
Scott: yeah, I'm definitely all out of like, you know, my list of things to buy gizmos and whatnot a New computers way at the bottom.

451
00:32:47,552 --> 00:33:08,669
Scott: But one day I'm probably gonna buy like an AMD 64 type machine awesome, and I'm either gonna buy like a wicked gaming computer and then Use my current computer as something awesome or I'll buy a wicked non gaming computer to make that my primary PC and then I'll turn my computer into a gaming computer that can be all windows all the time or

452
00:33:09,616 --> 00:33:09,990
Rym: VMware.

453
00:33:10,831 --> 00:33:12,341
Scott: VMware would be good if it was free.

454
00:33:12,422 --> 00:33:13,570
Scott: Well kind of isn't a new thing.

455
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:16,502
Rym: But yeah, we still have to see how that new thing pans out.

456
00:33:17,205 --> 00:33:18,250
Scott: It panned out pretty good.

457
00:33:18,391 --> 00:33:20,429
Scott: I just don't know how useful it would be for playing steam.

458
00:33:21,012 --> 00:33:27,400
Rym: I think it will be eventually but right now at least our computers are not fast enough to do that as well as we would like to.

459
00:33:28,951 --> 00:33:37,473
Rym: Yeah, see I'm still running a Thunderbird gigahertz with a gig of RAM and Yeah, it's real old slow.
