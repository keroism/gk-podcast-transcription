1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,487
Rym: It's Tuesday, November 11th.

2
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:12,170
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:12,692
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,753 --> 00:00:14,218
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:18,479
Rym: Tonight, why do we play the old games and not the new games?

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,918
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,469
Scott: So I ordered this pizza stone from Amazon.

8
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:36,500
Scott: after, you know, I researched what was the best pizza stone.

9
00:00:37,043 --> 00:00:38,520
Scott: Then I went on Amazon, I ordered it.

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,580
Scott: It was like the square one, which I thought was interesting.

11
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:43,058
Scott: But you know, who cares if they say it's the best is the best.

12
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:48,020
Rym: Well, I'm excited because this is part of the, uh, I was gonna say trifecta, but we're only buying two things.

13
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:49,724
Rym: My portion of this is.

14
00:00:49,744 --> 00:00:55,600
Rym: I ordered a waffle maker, which is apparently, uh, no, no, but it's in my Amazon queue.

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,646
Scott: So the pizza stone arrived today.

16
00:00:57,666 --> 00:01:00,554
Scott: I open it up and where is the stone?

17
00:01:00,635 --> 00:01:02,360
Rym: Well, there's a stone.

18
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,224
Scott: I open, there's a box.

19
00:01:04,384 --> 00:01:08,820
Scott: Inside the box is some crumpled, like brown paper and then another box.

20
00:01:09,441 --> 00:01:15,662
Scott: And in the other box is the pizza stone, which has like a corrugated cardboard frame that sort of holds it in the middle of the box.

21
00:01:16,165 --> 00:01:19,100
Scott: So it's not actually touching the box and it's not bouncing around or anything.

22
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:19,420
Scott: Right.

23
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:25,740
Scott: And, um, I go in to take the stone out and, uh, there's two stones in there because it's broken.

24
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:32,019
Scott: It says on the inner box, it says fragile on the outer boxes is amazon.com.

25
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:37,520
Scott: So I go to Amazon to click, like returns, you know, damaged in shipment.

26
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,622
Scott: Right.

27
00:01:39,023 --> 00:01:46,179
Scott: My pizza stone is broken and I get to the point where it says, you know, uh, print these out and put them on the package when you send it back.

28
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:46,862
Scott: Right.

29
00:01:47,544 --> 00:01:51,580
Scott: And it, uh, I click print and then it crashes.

30
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:53,104
Rym: That's great.

31
00:01:53,345 --> 00:01:54,692
Scott: So I go to Chrome, right.

32
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:01,060
Scott: Which is supposed to not crash or at least only crash one tab when it crashes, not 10 times per second.

33
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:01,361
Rym: Right.

34
00:02:02,227 --> 00:02:03,939
Scott: I click it and it crashes all of Chrome.

35
00:02:05,223 --> 00:02:06,760
Scott: And so it crashed Firefox and Chrome.

36
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,039
Scott: I'm going to try Internet Explorer after the show and I'm going to try Safari.

37
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,065
Scott: I'm going to try opera.

38
00:02:11,085 --> 00:02:13,580
Scott: I think Amazon might've figured out some exploit.

39
00:02:13,861 --> 00:02:18,520
Scott: They can crash all browsers or and they're just using it to prevent you from returning merchant.

40
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,121
Scott: You know what?

41
00:02:19,262 --> 00:02:23,699
Rym: It's brilliant because I can recall stories from my early days of I.T.

42
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:33,359
Rym: of certain companies that may have, if a problematic customer was on the line, just, uh, just hang up on them because it'll probably take them a while to figure out to call back.

43
00:02:33,981 --> 00:02:34,202
Scott: Yeah.

44
00:02:34,806 --> 00:02:37,320
Scott: And then they're going to wait in a long waiting queue again.

45
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:38,970
Rym: Good times.

46
00:02:39,295 --> 00:02:39,498
Scott: Yeah.

47
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:42,167
Scott: So news is.

48
00:02:42,187 --> 00:02:43,940
Scott: I don't know if you can handle my news.

49
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:45,719
Rym: I don't know if I can't either, but I'll say this.

50
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,840
Rym: When I got home, I saw that pizza stone box out on the porch and it was like open and on its side.

51
00:02:52,022 --> 00:02:53,960
Rym: And it was in a pretty sad state.

52
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,772
Rym: So I can't say that I'm that surprised.

53
00:02:55,813 --> 00:02:56,860
Rym: the pizza stone was broken.

54
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:57,502
Scott: Yeah.

55
00:02:58,024 --> 00:03:02,562
Scott: I guess there's the one disadvantage to ordering the things online, but I'll be going to the post office this weekend.

56
00:03:03,044 --> 00:03:06,160
Rym: Yeah, either that or worst case, charging back the credit card.

57
00:03:06,462 --> 00:03:06,704
Scott: Yeah.

58
00:03:06,724 --> 00:03:08,259
Scott: Well, no, they let you return shit.

59
00:03:08,662 --> 00:03:11,759
Scott: Well, apparently they don't find out.

60
00:03:13,043 --> 00:03:13,305
Rym: All right.

61
00:03:13,345 --> 00:03:15,320
Rym: So you've been talking about the stupid news.

62
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,380
Rym: Well, what could you possibly have?

63
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,840
Scott: I don't know if I can explain this news without just reading the article, which I hate doing.

64
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:27,840
Scott: But let me I'll read the headline and then you tell me what you think this headline means.

65
00:03:28,122 --> 00:03:28,486
Scott: All right.

66
00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:28,931
Rym: All right.

67
00:03:29,073 --> 00:03:29,437
Rym: I'm game.

68
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,060
Scott: Von Hans is to star in Les Freres Corbusier's Dance Dance Revolution.

69
00:03:35,904 --> 00:03:39,779
Rym: Are they making a French Canadian version of DDR?

70
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:45,598
Scott: There's going to be a play in the Ohio theater that is...

71
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,322
Rym: Wait, wait.

72
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:48,740
Rym: The Ohio theater in Ohio?

73
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:50,875
Scott: I must assume in Ohio.

74
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,668
Rym: No, it's got to be the thing.

75
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:53,979
Rym: Ohio was named after.

76
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:07,360
Scott: I don't know, but Les Freres will transform the Ohio theater into a fully immersive bombed out discotheque as it fuses Japanese rave music with sophomore comedy and a futuristic dance spectacular.

77
00:04:08,522 --> 00:04:11,900
Scott: The show is inspired by the wildly popular video game of the same name.

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,079
Rym: This sounds kind of awesome.

79
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,959
Rym: You know, Emily and I were going to go to the opera, but fuck that.

80
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,896
Scott: Additional cast members will include person, person, person, person, person.

81
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:27,980
Scott: Prior works include Obie Award winning a very merry unauthorized children's Scientology pageant.

82
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,100
Scott: Boozy, Hell House and Head-A-Tron.

83
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,613
Rym: Head-A-Tron.

84
00:04:33,735 --> 00:04:34,040
Scott: Yeah.

85
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,099
Rym: What is that about?

86
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,600
Scott: I don't know, but I kind of want to see a very merry unauthorized children's Scientology pageant.

87
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,280
Rym: I can say one thing, a bombed out discotheque.

88
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,860
Scott: Well, no disco T-H-E with an accent sign.

89
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,420
Rym: Yes, that's how you spell discotheque.

90
00:04:48,702 --> 00:04:48,912
Rym: Q-U-E.

91
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,140
Rym: That's how you spell discotheque.

92
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,138
Scott: Some people spell it D-I-S-C-O-T-E-K.

93
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,480
Rym: Yes, they're wrong.

94
00:04:54,290 --> 00:05:00,620
Rym: But bombed out discotheque gives me the Charles Barkley shut up and jam guide and vibe.

95
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,880
Scott: Japanese rave music with sophomore comedy fusion futuristic dance.

96
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:05,458
Scott: I don't know.

97
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:15,240
Rym: I get this like Japanese DDR equivalent of Charles Barkley shut up and jam guide and in a future post-apocalyptic world where DDR is outlawed.

98
00:05:16,102 --> 00:05:20,360
Rym: Only sophomore comedy remains dancing and bombed out discotheques.

99
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,620
Scott: Well, we'll feature original songs by Gary Atler and Phoebe Kreutz.

100
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,235
Scott: The production will play the Ohio theater December 3rd through 20th.

101
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:29,379
Scott: Alex Timbers will direct.

102
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,699
Scott: This is from theater mania dot com.

103
00:05:33,464 --> 00:05:34,720
Scott: I don't know what else to say about that.

104
00:05:35,242 --> 00:05:38,558
Scott: For more information, visit lessfrayrares.org.

105
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,340
Rym: You know, I really kind of want to see it now, but I don't want to go to Ohio.

106
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,060
Rym: But then again, maybe the Ohio theater is not in Ohio.

107
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:57,540
Scott: Yeah, Hans is the star is best known for playing gay teen Luke Snyder on the CBS daytime drama as the world turns and appeared off Broadway last season in Die Mommy Die.

108
00:05:59,263 --> 00:06:01,240
Scott: This is a high class theater production here.

109
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:01,410
Rym: Wow.

110
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,345
Scott: That's like we're talking.

111
00:06:02,365 --> 00:06:04,418
Scott: we're talking Tony Award lock in.

112
00:06:06,523 --> 00:06:08,638
Scott: This is going to run longer than cats, I guarantee it.

113
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:17,120
Rym: So if we don't get a chance to see this, I urge anyone within a radius of where bring in a video camera.

114
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,418
Scott: Get me some bootlegs.

115
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,880
Scott: Where is the CD audio in the soundtrack?

116
00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:23,820
Rym: I implore you.

117
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,639
Rym: Please go see this and tell us what happens.

118
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,499
Scott: Yeah, I don't know if it's the if the Ohio theaters in Ohio or not, but God damn.

119
00:06:34,643 --> 00:06:36,780
Scott: I mean, we don't even have like Mario the musical.

120
00:06:37,421 --> 00:06:39,998
Rym: Well, well, well, well, I'm sure there is.

121
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:45,660
Scott: Well, yeah, but not in a real theater define real at Ohio.

122
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,203
Scott: We're better.

123
00:06:46,847 --> 00:06:47,370
Scott: All right.

124
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,240
Rym: So I want to talk about this just because there is a whole bunch of rambling on slash.

125
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:54,525
Scott: Just one more thing.

126
00:06:54,565 --> 00:06:54,867
Scott: I went to.

127
00:06:55,188 --> 00:06:57,360
Scott: I went to the Les Freres Web site here.

128
00:06:58,201 --> 00:07:00,800
Scott: And here's here's a few things that must be read.

129
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:01,904
Scott: Ready?

130
00:07:01,924 --> 00:07:09,380
Scott: So it's a futuristic dance, spectacular, fusing, unmerciful Japanese rave music with deeply regrettable sophomore comedy.

131
00:07:09,682 --> 00:07:11,580
Scott: Oh, they've got more adjectives.

132
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,596
Rym: Those are good adjectives.

133
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,423
Scott: And then wait.

134
00:07:13,664 --> 00:07:16,760
Scott: And a futuristic Orwellian society where dancing is illegal.

135
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,460
Rym: Oh, my God, it is Charles Barkley.

136
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,243
Rym: Shut up.

137
00:07:19,384 --> 00:07:22,155
Scott: A group of local street toughs harbor.

138
00:07:22,215 --> 00:07:24,182
Scott: no hope of overthrowing the fascistic.

139
00:07:24,222 --> 00:07:29,720
Scott: no fun government until a mysterious dance prophet named Moonbeam Funk arrives.

140
00:07:30,224 --> 00:07:31,700
Rym: Oh, my sweet Jesus.

141
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:34,979
Scott: I can't say anymore.

142
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,799
Rym: I've got to say click here to buy tickets.

143
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,959
Rym: We've got to say I clicked here to buy tickets, buy tickets, just find out smart ticks, then you'll find out where it is.

144
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,740
Scott: General admission seating.

145
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,560
Rym: Wait, general admission.

146
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:50,140
Scott: I guess you just go in and sit wherever you see.

147
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,759
Scott: Ohio Theater, Worcester Street, New York.

148
00:07:53,788 --> 00:07:53,971
Scott: What?

149
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:54,315
Rym: What?

150
00:07:54,355 --> 00:07:54,679
Rym: We're going.

151
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,730
Scott: Yeah, duh.

152
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:56,420
Rym: Oh, my God.

153
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,320
Scott: The Ohio Theater is in New York, New York.

154
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,267
Scott: One oh one two.

155
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,498
Scott: That's right near my work.

156
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,308
Scott: Oh, my God.

157
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:02,757
Scott: What bring in?

158
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:04,540
Scott: It's around the corner of my office.

159
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,102
Rym: When's it playing?

160
00:08:05,122 --> 00:08:08,897
Scott: Just buy like December 20th, December 2nd through something sweet.

161
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:10,913
Scott: All right.

162
00:08:11,315 --> 00:08:12,279
Scott: So like date and time.

163
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:12,943
Scott: All right.

164
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,139
Scott: Well, let me look at it again.

165
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:18,779
Rym: OK, all right.

166
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,460
Rym: I told you couldn't have been in Ohio.

167
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,066
Scott: Yeah.

168
00:08:22,287 --> 00:08:24,160
Scott: So I was thinking Ohio or France.

169
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:25,123
Scott: No, no.

170
00:08:25,183 --> 00:08:30,180
Scott: Around the corner from my office, literally like like a block away.

171
00:08:30,522 --> 00:08:31,879
Rym: I'm so excited about this.

172
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:40,360
Scott: Yeah, I work on the Lafayette and Prince Spring is one street south of Prince and Broom is like one or two streets.

173
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,760
Rym: OK, kids, we'll post in the forum once we've picked our dates.

174
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,680
Rym: And I hope any of you in the city will come and see the show.

175
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:53,337
Rym: And then afterward we will probably have 16 showings.

176
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,591
Scott: All of them are at 8 p.m.

177
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:58,980
Scott: on various days, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, Tuesday.

178
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,719
Rym: Much like how theaters function and not Mondays, though.

179
00:09:02,443 --> 00:09:02,666
Rym: Yeah.

180
00:09:02,727 --> 00:09:03,940
Rym: Much like how theaters function.

181
00:09:04,101 --> 00:09:04,303
Scott: Yeah.

182
00:09:04,484 --> 00:09:04,686
Scott: All right.

183
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,077
Rym: OK, good guy.

184
00:09:06,561 --> 00:09:07,413
Rym: Well, we're going to that.

185
00:09:07,636 --> 00:09:07,879
Rym: Yeah.

186
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,620
Rym: Well, my news really doesn't live up now.

187
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,519
Scott: See, I told you my news was awesome.

188
00:09:13,383 --> 00:09:14,780
Rym: I got to admit you were right.

189
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:17,540
Rym: But I got to talk about this because there's a lot of rambling.

190
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:25,800
Rym: But there was this article on Slashdot and the headline was, and I quote, vital parts of games as DLC.

191
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:33,843
Rym: Now, if you're not hip to the Internet, DLC means downloadable content, which I think is a stupid acronym.

192
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:37,380
Scott: Why do I much prefer the UGC to the DLC?

193
00:09:38,101 --> 00:09:39,329
Rym: Why is there an L?

194
00:09:39,611 --> 00:09:40,939
Rym: download is one word?

195
00:09:41,141 --> 00:09:41,683
Scott: That's true.

196
00:09:41,844 --> 00:09:44,860
Scott: But DC is people think DC Comics in Washington, DC.

197
00:09:45,341 --> 00:09:46,880
Scott: So you need to do something different in this.

198
00:09:47,121 --> 00:09:48,339
Rym: But DLC is not what you do.

199
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,396
Rym: I'm not sure what you do.

200
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,798
Scott: Downloadable content.

201
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:52,940
Rym: Maybe you just say downloadable content.

202
00:09:53,423 --> 00:09:54,999
Rym: I don't think we need an acronym for that yet.

203
00:09:55,701 --> 00:10:04,120
Scott: Why don't we just say, you know, I don't understand why when something is, you know, when you change the distribution mechanism, you need to call it something different.

204
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,360
Scott: Well, in this case, we kind of it's a video game, whether you download it or buy it on a disk.

205
00:10:09,262 --> 00:10:18,100
Rym: But video games have always been in this really kind of interesting situation where the in every market, in anything you can buy and sell physical goods.

206
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,980
Rym: There's the primary market and the secondary market.

207
00:10:21,364 --> 00:10:22,579
Rym: And then there's the black market.

208
00:10:23,104 --> 00:10:24,260
Rym: There's also the gray market.

209
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:33,740
Rym: But anyway, there's this kind of gradations and, you know, people buy things in retail stores, but then they resell those things through pawn shops or to their friends or on eBay.

210
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:42,120
Rym: Sometimes people steal things or get, you know, off shelf merchandise from stores in weird situations to sell in the gray market or the black market.

211
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:47,767
Rym: But usually most of the commerce of something is in the primary retail market, at least in America.

212
00:10:47,787 --> 00:10:48,560
Rym: That's the way things are.

213
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,514
Scott: There's a lot more sales of DVD.

214
00:10:50,554 --> 00:10:51,400
Scott: if you compare sale.

215
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,399
Scott: I mean, DVD sales aren't that big except on certain things.

216
00:10:54,901 --> 00:11:03,300
Scott: But if you compare DVD sales of new legitimate DVDs at Best Buy and Amazon and compare it to used DVD sales, used DVD sales has nothing.

217
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:14,463
Scott: If you compare like even CD sales and MP3 sales are down in the you're not that great either are a lot more than used CD sales, which are restricted to like tiny shops in random places.

218
00:11:14,744 --> 00:11:21,040
Rym: But even at the height of the Napster paranoia, when the music industry suddenly collectively realized that they were completely screwed.

219
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:27,360
Rym: They weren't like they were always down on the secondary market, but that was such like.

220
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:37,160
Rym: basically it's like music got to the point where piracy came into existence and destroyed the industry long before the secondary market could kind of come in and do this.

221
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:45,040
Rym: But with video games, the secondary market, as far as I can tell, is getting to the point where it's almost bigger than the primary market.

222
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,679
Scott: Here is why you're ready for this.

223
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,000
Scott: This is the reason that the video game secondary market is so huge.

224
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:53,100
Rym: I think that the reasons for it are numerous.

225
00:11:53,521 --> 00:11:54,880
Scott: No, it's really simply ready.

226
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:55,401
Rym: OK.

227
00:11:56,024 --> 00:11:58,800
Scott: The people who buy video games are punk kids with no money.

228
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:04,960
Scott: They want to play a lot of different games, but they can only afford to actually buy one or two at the price of fifty dollars.

229
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,659
Rym: But at the same time, they could just pirate them.

230
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,305
Scott: That's true.

231
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:09,600
Scott: But it's a lot easier.

232
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,596
Scott: You know, it's hard to pirate games for, say, the 360 or the PS3 or the Wii.

233
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,420
Scott: So when those kids want to play those games now, they get a couple for presents.

234
00:12:18,562 --> 00:12:19,938
Scott: You know, maybe they buy one or two.

235
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,003
Scott: They beat them.

236
00:12:21,224 --> 00:12:26,320
Scott: There's no replay value or they, you know, they'd much rather play a new game even if there is replay value.

237
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:34,600
Scott: So GameStop easily tricks these punk kids into trading their games in because kid doesn't have 50 bucks, but he's got 10 bucks.

238
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:40,142
Scott: She gives in his 50 dollar game and 10 bucks, gets a new game, gets another 10 bucks and does it again.

239
00:12:40,183 --> 00:12:46,400
Scott: And he's effectively buying new video games for 10 bucks, which you can't afford to do where you can't afford the 50 dollars.

240
00:12:46,481 --> 00:12:48,437
Scott: He just only has one video game at a time.

241
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:58,083
Scott: And but he could actually hold the game onto it until he beats it, which is preferable to, say, doing blockbuster game rentals where he might have to return the game before he's beaten the game.

242
00:12:58,325 --> 00:13:10,626
Rym: See, but at the same time, I think there's a little more to it than that, because with video games, especially among the kinds of people who care about that sort of thing, having the game right away is important to these kids because you want to beat it and play it.

243
00:13:10,908 --> 00:13:12,460
Scott: You can get a used game right away.

244
00:13:12,901 --> 00:13:13,951
Rym: Well, not necessarily.

245
00:13:13,991 --> 00:13:14,920
Rym: It depends on where you live.

246
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,923
Rym: I mean, we live in New York City where some kid will buy the game and beat it and return it that day.

247
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:23,560
Rym: But in a lot of places, you go to GameStop, they're not going to have the used version of the game for weeks now.

248
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:29,444
Scott: So you return your old game and buy, you know, and it becomes a used copy for someone else who's going to buy that.

249
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:35,900
Scott: And then you buy the new game new and then you return that later and you buy, you know, the other new game new, I think.

250
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,502
Rym: But there's more to it than that in that a lot of people I mean, movies, you could do the same thing.

251
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:49,442
Rym: And movies are even in many ways less kind of time dependent, because if you care about seeing the movie when it's current, you see it in the theater when it's actually current.

252
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:54,900
Rym: If you're going to watch it on DVD, then it really doesn't matter when you watch it to even like hardcore movie people.

253
00:13:55,481 --> 00:14:02,807
Rym: But a lot of people buy movies and collect movies and you don't really have this secondary market for DVDs.

254
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:05,420
Scott: as much as the price of a DVD isn't fifty dollars.

255
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,879
Scott: It's like fifteen dollars.

256
00:14:07,201 --> 00:14:09,800
Scott: If a DVD was fifty dollars, you would see the secondary market.

257
00:14:10,021 --> 00:14:17,700
Rym: I don't know, because it seems like people who buy movies, buy DVDs, they hold on to them for various reasons because they're fifteen dollars.

258
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,560
Rym: Well, no, partly because I think they want to they feel like I'm going to use this again.

259
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:23,119
Rym: I'm going to show this movie to someone.

260
00:14:23,221 --> 00:14:24,620
Rym: It's part of my collection.

261
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,574
Rym: I was fifty dollars.

262
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,860
Scott: They'd be doing that with a lot less of them.

263
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,382
Rym: I don't know.

264
00:14:28,603 --> 00:14:41,140
Rym: But at least video games, especially a lot of modern single player games, have basically zero replay value, like not like a movie that's only an hour investment or a two hour investment where, you know, I'll watch Star Wars again.

265
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,639
Rym: I'm glad I'm a million times.

266
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,121
Rym: Yeah.

267
00:14:43,444 --> 00:14:45,260
Rym: Or I'll watch The Matrix one.

268
00:14:45,624 --> 00:14:46,520
Rym: Well, the Matrix.

269
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,977
Rym: There weren't any other Matrix movies.

270
00:14:48,483 --> 00:14:49,958
Scott: Well, you only saw one of the other two.

271
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,401
Scott: Yes.

272
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:53,071
Rym: And I knew better, you know, it's.

273
00:14:53,111 --> 00:15:08,660
Rym: besides I do recall that you and several other people, the front row crew for quite some time not only insisted that I had seen the movie and that I was with you in the theater seeing the movie, but you argued this point against me for some time.

274
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,500
Scott: I think you could have been lying.

275
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:19,780
Rym: It wasn't until I proved with a pay stub that I, in fact, was living in Poughkeepsie and working at IBM at the time that you relented.

276
00:15:20,201 --> 00:15:22,680
Scott: The point is, is I think, well, that's a tangent.

277
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:27,540
Scott: But I think the Matrix movie, the second and third Matrix movies, they weren't bad.

278
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,980
Scott: Well, no, they were bad.

279
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,120
Scott: They were bad movies, but they weren't super bad.

280
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:40,560
Scott: They were just regular bad and they got and they were treated as super bad because they were held in the light of the super great Matrix one.

281
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,819
Scott: And I think, you know, the second half of Death Note suffers from the same thing and many other, you know, a lot of things do.

282
00:15:46,501 --> 00:15:56,103
Rym: But the other thing about the video game industry that's interesting is along with this kind of gigantic secondary market, there's this so-called hardcore gamer idea that they've got.

283
00:15:56,143 --> 00:16:00,299
Rym: You know, there are the hardcore gamers and the people who are really into games feel like they're the base.

284
00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:01,840
Rym: And they used to be true.

285
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,403
Rym: I mean, think about it.

286
00:16:02,423 --> 00:16:06,499
Rym: Video games used to be a very niche thing and not that many people played video games.

287
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,840
Rym: It was kind of a weird side hobby.

288
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,120
Rym: But as video games mainstream, do they really mainstreamed?

289
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,580
Rym: I mean, video, everyone plays video games.

290
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:21,698
Rym: Some woman at my work bought a Wii today and she's like, yeah, I heard so much about these Wii games and bowling and stuff that I just bought one at the Circuit City.

291
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:22,585
Rym: that's closing.

292
00:16:23,353 --> 00:16:23,900
Scott: Oh, good deal.

293
00:16:24,362 --> 00:16:24,605
Scott: Yeah.

294
00:16:24,686 --> 00:16:25,499
Scott: Was it 10 percent off?

295
00:16:26,022 --> 00:16:26,532
Rym: I think so.

296
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:26,980
Rym: It was cheap.

297
00:16:27,381 --> 00:16:30,099
Rym: She bought it just kind of on a whim while she was out at lunch.

298
00:16:30,301 --> 00:16:34,798
Scott: Well, I mean, Wiis aren't that expensive to begin with, but if there's a little bit of discount on it, it's a big deal.

299
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:48,345
Rym: But as they mainstreamified, we've got to this point where it's much more profitable to either make a game that has a low barrier to entry and a recurring cost or a game that's just crap.

300
00:16:48,687 --> 00:16:52,262
Rym: I believe all those games that have the name of an animal followed by the letter Z.

301
00:16:52,283 --> 00:16:58,759
Scott: Yeah, you know, making software is pretty easy, especially if, you know, you only have to change, you know, a little bit of it.

302
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:03,020
Scott: You know, it's like, well, I'll make a game, you know, with a guy who jumps on bad guys.

303
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,099
Scott: It's a side scrolling game.

304
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:04,886
Scott: OK, I made one.

305
00:17:04,906 --> 00:17:06,739
Scott: Now I want to make another one.

306
00:17:07,221 --> 00:17:10,500
Scott: All I do is change the pictures on it, maybe redo some of the levels.

307
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:11,469
Scott: It'll take a few days.

308
00:17:11,811 --> 00:17:12,560
Scott: I got another game.

309
00:17:12,641 --> 00:17:14,500
Scott: It took you know, it didn't cost me almost anything.

310
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,560
Scott: And I can still sell it for 30 bucks.

311
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:19,280
Scott: And even if only a few people buy it, I'm in the money.

312
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:31,879
Rym: So the video game market is in this really difficult situation where the people who are into games now, I'm not going to try to make a value judgment as to what games are good or what games are not, other than the fact that pets is a bad game.

313
00:17:33,282 --> 00:17:44,160
Rym: But the problem is the people who even a game who are really, really into games are also the ones who tend to not play the games that are mainstream and make money.

314
00:17:44,421 --> 00:17:47,740
Rym: There's much more incentive to make the crappy game and sell it to the non gamers.

315
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:57,123
Rym: I mean, look, how much money is Fallout three going to make compared to how much money it costs to actually design that game versus like another Sims expansion or Burning Crusade or something?

316
00:17:57,143 --> 00:18:10,665
Scott: Well, basically, you know, the video game industry is something out, something that started out as niche only, you know, because it was, you know, delegated to the, you know, the as a kid's toy and, you know, many other reasons, you know, throughout its history.

317
00:18:10,705 --> 00:18:12,480
Scott: And it's still sort of backwards.

318
00:18:12,641 --> 00:18:18,770
Scott: If you look at every other, you know, medium of, you know, artistic works in the U.S.

319
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:19,960
Scott: entertainment medium, right.

320
00:18:20,761 --> 00:18:26,345
Scott: Big time money making movies, the blockbusters, the things that make the most money they spend the most money on.

321
00:18:26,385 --> 00:18:30,404
Scott: and the ones that are for the quote hardcore are in the art house theater.

322
00:18:30,605 --> 00:18:32,840
Scott: They cost less money to make and less people see them.

323
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,019
Scott: It's in balance there.

324
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:38,862
Rym: In the video game industry, the books that the art house game is usually more expensive to make.

325
00:18:39,103 --> 00:18:44,967
Scott: Yeah, they the the hardcore video games are the ones they spend the most money on and make the least money on.

326
00:18:45,088 --> 00:18:47,760
Scott: or well, not the least, but not enough money on.

327
00:18:48,241 --> 00:19:02,320
Scott: And the game that costs almost nothing to make makes plenty of money, at least relative to the cost, you know, and sells a bajillion copies and doesn't appeal to the people who care about, you know, care the hardcore and appeals to just, you know, the masses.

328
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:16,839
Rym: So basically, but the video game industry still needs these hardcore people because while they don't make money necessarily from marketing games to these people, those people provide this kind of pseudo culture that is used to market video games.

329
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,180
Rym: like there's the subculture of video gaming.

330
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:24,384
Rym: And I feel like that subculture is used to market video games to people who aren't in that subculture.

331
00:19:25,168 --> 00:19:28,204
Rym: Maybe we'll get to the point where the subculture doesn't actually exist anymore.

332
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:32,512
Rym: And the image of the gamer that you see in like the magazine is just completely made up.

333
00:19:32,695 --> 00:19:32,999
Rym: I don't know.

334
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:47,742
Scott: I think that the the the main problem now, I think, with the image of the, you know, gamer is that the actual, you know, people who care about video games and, you know, games are a big part of their lives and they self identify as a, you know, video game player.

335
00:19:47,762 --> 00:19:55,720
Scott: I think that those people have, you know, sort of balkanized in, you know, to the extreme to where you can't really say, well, what's a gamer?

336
00:19:55,861 --> 00:20:02,939
Scott: Is it that, you know, guy who plays, you know, DDR at the arcade nonstop or is it that guy sitting there still playing Counter-Strike?

337
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:06,360
Scott: Is it, you know, is it the guy who's playing Smash Brothers in the tournaments?

338
00:20:07,042 --> 00:20:08,046
Scott: You know, these are all like.

339
00:20:08,448 --> 00:20:11,664
Scott: so, you know, to most people out there, those are all like the same person.

340
00:20:11,725 --> 00:20:14,300
Scott: But when you really look at it, they're completely different people.

341
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,360
Scott: The guy playing DDR is never playing Counter-Strike.

342
00:20:16,945 --> 00:20:18,339
Scott: You know, they're they're completely separate.

343
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,900
Rym: But here's here's the one thing that ties it all together.

344
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:55,059
Rym: I mean, we went to PAX, of course, and you look at the demographic of people who self identify as gamers and by and large, while a number of them tend to be young, poor punk kids in high school, it's also affluent 20 somethings, oftentimes tech workers, people who have a lot of money to burn and unless they're podcasters or something, have plenty of time to to play video games and they're into video games and games like Fallout and these kind of high production value games can make a lot of money if all those people who have this money buy it.

345
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,960
Scott: But there aren't that many of those people.

346
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:57,682
Rym: No, there are.

347
00:20:57,722 --> 00:21:00,337
Rym: There are enough of those people for these games to be profitable.

348
00:21:00,357 --> 00:21:01,628
Rym: if those are enough.

349
00:21:02,132 --> 00:21:02,940
Rym: Well, no, there's plenty.

350
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:19,920
Rym: If the people buy the games at retail, but with the secondary market more and more, especially when more games are out there and there's more entertainment options available, even the affluent 20 somethings, I think, are willing to wait and buy a game used or hold off and not even pirate, but just use the perfectly legal secondary market.

351
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:34,940
Rym: And the gaming industry has to come up with a way to either have to give up on these people or come up with a way to get these people to have some reason to buy the game at retail as opposed to from the secondary market, giving the game store the money.

352
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:42,339
Rym: Now, Steam is a great way to do that because you cut out the game store entirely and you definitely can't sell a game you bought on Steam to anyone.

353
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,062
Scott: That's true.

354
00:21:43,443 --> 00:21:47,419
Rym: But at the same time, that doesn't work for console games so much until now.

355
00:21:48,622 --> 00:21:55,440
Rym: The point of the article was basically that one way around this and it's basically a loophole to get around the first sale doctrine.

356
00:21:56,261 --> 00:22:05,819
Rym: What if you sell games for online consoles, but you take advantage of this downloadable content business to say, all right, you buy the game, you can play it.

357
00:22:06,221 --> 00:22:07,378
Rym: I don't care where you bought it from.

358
00:22:07,901 --> 00:22:13,359
Rym: But to beat the boss at the end of the game, you got to pay 20 bucks to get the downloadable content.

359
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,019
Rym: Well, you can't transfer that.

360
00:22:15,281 --> 00:22:19,463
Scott: Well, people who don't realize this would be pissed and people who do realize it would never buy the game.

361
00:22:19,925 --> 00:22:29,139
Rym: See, no, I don't know, because maybe the people who are really into gaming will just buy the game at retail, which of course includes all the downloadable content for free.

362
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:33,260
Rym: You only have to pay for it if you bought the bootleg secondhand copy.

363
00:22:34,004 --> 00:22:35,079
Scott: Oh, is that how it works?

364
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,100
Scott: That's how it works.

365
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,318
Scott: How could you make that go?

366
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:38,190
Rym: What do you mean?

367
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:38,800
Rym: How do you make it go?

368
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,325
Scott: All right.

369
00:22:39,345 --> 00:22:40,320
Scott: Technologically speaking.

370
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:40,982
Scott: All right.

371
00:22:41,022 --> 00:22:43,880
Rym: So I buy Mario eight on the Xbox.

372
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:44,645
Rym: All right.

373
00:22:45,109 --> 00:22:46,380
Rym: And I buy the thing.

374
00:22:46,681 --> 00:22:55,031
Rym: But when I put it in my Xbox, much like when I pick up an item and wow, it binds to my Xbox like that, it downloads the downloadable content.

375
00:22:55,312 --> 00:23:02,079
Rym: once that copy of the game that I bought, that physical disk will never download the content again for free.

376
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,780
Scott: But what if I, you know, my Xbox dies and they get a new Xbox?

377
00:23:06,881 --> 00:23:08,320
Rym: Well, you get the entitlements back.

378
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:14,018
Rym: So if you get a new if your Xbox dies, you can transfer the entitlements from your old Xbox to the new Xbox.

379
00:23:15,503 --> 00:23:19,420
Rym: But if I buy a second Xbox, I can't have the entitlement on both.

380
00:23:19,881 --> 00:23:24,080
Rym: If I sell the game to some dude on eBay, he can't get the downloadable content for free.

381
00:23:24,341 --> 00:23:25,088
Rym: He has to buy it.

382
00:23:25,148 --> 00:23:26,379
Rym: But it's only 20 bucks.

383
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:32,902
Rym: Basically, it's this really kind of underhanded way to completely cut out the secondary market.

384
00:23:34,692 --> 00:23:36,260
Scott: And there's nothing illegal about it.

385
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:39,780
Rym: It's perfectly legal and it's not even that unethical.

386
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:45,300
Rym: And while this is not happening yet, I mean, we are seeing a lot of just sort of dickish.

387
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,620
Scott: It's not, you know, wrong, but it would work.

388
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:58,760
Rym: And I don't know if this is actually ever going to happen or not, because it's I could go 50/50 on whether or not the gaming community would just go to ease.

389
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:10,283
Rym: They would either suck it up and just buy the games and then GameStop might go out of business or they'll just freak out and pirate everything forever more and pull an RIAA reaction.

390
00:24:10,303 --> 00:24:15,559
Rym: I mean, remember when the RIAA got really bad and people who were into music basically just said, you know what, we hate you.

391
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:19,039
Rym: We're going to pirate music just because until you go away.

392
00:24:19,863 --> 00:24:22,339
Rym: And I feel like that could happen with video games.

393
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:32,280
Scott: I think I'm actually starting to you know, I know that early on in this podcast, you know, as in the early days of GeekNights, right, we were often, you know, crying.

394
00:24:32,623 --> 00:24:34,280
Scott: You know, the death of the PC game.

395
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:34,601
Scott: Right.

396
00:24:34,743 --> 00:24:36,180
Scott: You know, PC game is dying.

397
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,184
Scott: PC gaming is done.

398
00:24:37,245 --> 00:24:40,340
Rym: They were as far as I felt, but there's been a big comeback.

399
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,024
Scott: Well, it's not.

400
00:24:41,327 --> 00:24:41,871
Scott: it's not just that.

401
00:24:41,892 --> 00:24:42,860
Scott: there's been a big comeback.

402
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:48,780
Scott: I think and what I've realized is that I let's say I make an Xbox game, right?

403
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:58,800
Scott: Even if I make a game that appeals to the mass audience and not just, you know, the hardcore quote audience, the most copies I can sell is one per Xbox.

404
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,399
Scott: And there's a lot of Xbox is out there.

405
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:00,948
Scott: Millions.

406
00:25:01,275 --> 00:25:01,500
Rym: Right.

407
00:25:02,442 --> 00:25:03,920
Scott: It's a lot more PCs out there.

408
00:25:04,081 --> 00:25:13,361
Scott: And remember back in the day when like mist came out, even people who had no interest in video games or anything, just everyone had every PC had a fucking copy of mist.

409
00:25:13,843 --> 00:25:15,953
Scott: Every single one is like every.

410
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:18,225
Scott: you could go over to someone's house if they had a DOS computer.

411
00:25:18,607 --> 00:25:18,808
Scott: There was.

412
00:25:18,828 --> 00:25:22,647
Scott: there was a mist box somewhere in that house that he was there somewhere.

413
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:25,420
Scott: And World of Warcraft is sort of the same way now.

414
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,040
Scott: Everyone's got computers.

415
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:31,042
Scott: The people with computers in World of Warcraft and no other video games whatsoever going on.

416
00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:46,162
Scott: You know, and I think the companies in their quest for, you know, the money and realizing that, hey, these consoles, as cool as they are and, you know, the living room experience, whatnot, PC gaming is really the way to make the most money.

417
00:25:46,202 --> 00:25:50,760
Scott: You make a game that appeals to an incredibly huge audience and there's no bigger audience than the PC audience.

418
00:25:51,161 --> 00:25:51,422
Scott: Right.

419
00:25:51,803 --> 00:25:56,383
Scott: And you make it where you can only get it by downloading it or have some sort of subscription.

420
00:25:56,464 --> 00:26:05,620
Rym: Well, look, they're doing the same thing with the market and you're like Rock Band and all these games, the downloadable content makes it to where they make all their money from that after the fact.

421
00:26:06,404 --> 00:26:07,899
Rym: And I think that's going to work just as well, too.

422
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:27,420
Rym: But it worries me because I feel like the only way to make money in the long run, you know, in the kind of end game scenario of video games now is going to be either recurring costs because the game is online in some fashion, downloadable content that is tied to you or really, really crappy games with very broad appeal.

423
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:29,118
Scott: All three.

424
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,284
Rym: Well, yeah, that's the thing.

425
00:26:30,304 --> 00:26:34,840
Rym: You can do those three things, but that means there's not going to be another fallout.

426
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:50,300
Scott: Well, no, eventually what's going to happen is the video game market is slowly but surely correcting itself to fall in line with movies and books and music and everything else to where all the really popular things that cost more to make are going to have really broad appeal and be really shitty.

427
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:55,247
Scott: And all the really high quality things are going to have a very small appeal and not have big budgets.

428
00:26:55,952 --> 00:26:56,939
Scott: And that's how it's going to be.

429
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:03,197
Scott: You know, I mean, and, you know, the next natural selection is going to have a very small budget scraped together by a few guys out west.

430
00:27:03,921 --> 00:27:07,600
Scott: And it's going to appeal to the very small audience of awesome people like us.

431
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,179
Scott: And we're going to play and be happy.

432
00:27:10,064 --> 00:27:12,780
Scott: And they'll make, you know, spore two or whatever in a billion.

433
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:16,921
Rym: Of course, I point out this brings this brings up a much more interesting end game because.

434
00:27:16,941 --> 00:27:17,243
Rym: All right.

435
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:20,419
Rym: So video games are going to hit the point where movies are now.

436
00:27:21,061 --> 00:27:26,559
Rym: But movies have their own problem with end game because of movie rentals and all sorts of other things.

437
00:27:27,784 --> 00:27:29,260
Rym: So what's going to happen with movies?

438
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:36,180
Rym: I mean, the end game for video games might hit after the point where movies and other mainstream media have gone beyond whatever comes next.

439
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,403
Rym: Well, really, the

440
00:27:37,443 --> 00:27:56,498
Scott: main reason that movies and video games aren't in the same situation as music is because bandwidth is limited and eventually all of this will become moot because people have enough bandwidth to where trading a multi gigabyte video game will be as simple as trading an MP3 on the Internet and then everything will go to shit.

441
00:27:56,921 --> 00:27:58,840
Rym: But video games will still have downloadable content.

442
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,998
Rym: Movies can't have that.

443
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:02,819
Rym: Well, they could.

444
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:03,425
Rym: They could.

445
00:28:03,446 --> 00:28:04,299
Rym: I can envision that.

446
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,338
Rym: However, it horrifies me.

447
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,379
Rym: It really horrifies me.

448
00:28:08,801 --> 00:28:09,699
Rym: I mean, imagine this.

449
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:17,140
Rym: Imagine the day where you can pay five bucks after you watch Star Wars to see Star Wars the entire thing again, except Yoda's naked.

450
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,460
Rym: Anyway, things of the day.

451
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:29,160
Rym: So Emily and I were looking at stuff on YouTube and we stumbled across this.

452
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,260
Rym: And I think it's pretty cool.

453
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:44,359
Rym: Basically, take make MIDI music, but make MIDI music in such a way that the notes you have constructed form pictures that are relevant to Mario Paint, to the video game that you are making the music from.

454
00:28:44,521 --> 00:28:45,720
Scott: So Mario Paint, Bunch of Game Boys.

455
00:28:46,845 --> 00:28:47,660
Rym: No, not quite.

456
00:28:47,741 --> 00:28:48,438
Rym: No, no.

457
00:28:48,903 --> 00:28:49,414
Rym: It's a lot more.

458
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,045
Rym: You're right.

459
00:28:50,066 --> 00:28:51,000
Scott: The swan is the king.

460
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:51,819
Scott: Everything else sucks.

461
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:56,120
Rym: I don't really want to explain it, but it starts out pretty good with the Tetris pieces.

462
00:28:56,642 --> 00:29:02,720
Rym: But the Gradius near the end and the entire Donkey Kong are masterpieces.

463
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,940
Scott: Yeah, the Donkey Kong and the Gradius really are sort of amazing.

464
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,240
Scott: The thing is, you won't understand the Gradius unless you know Gradius music.

465
00:29:09,341 --> 00:29:11,520
Scott: But the Donkey Kong, anyone can understand.

466
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,038
Rym: Yes, it's a whole Donkey Kong.

467
00:29:14,844 --> 00:29:16,198
Scott: People have no idea what you're talking about.

468
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:21,499
Rym: I know because it's hard to really explain the awesome of this without just watching it.

469
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,219
Rym: So watch my thing of the day.

470
00:29:24,727 --> 00:29:25,218
Rym: It's cool.

471
00:29:26,761 --> 00:29:33,820
Scott: So I'm a big fan of all sorts of quirky indie RPGs lately, and I like to look at them and buy some of them, but and never play them.

472
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,287
Scott: That's my.

473
00:29:34,307 --> 00:29:35,099
Scott: that's my thing lately.

474
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,665
Scott: Right.

475
00:29:35,705 --> 00:29:37,140
Scott: I got to really got to play more of these things.

476
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:43,019
Scott: But I found this one and this one's in particularly interesting because it comes on a single card.

477
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:47,900
Scott: It's like a trifold square card, right, with printing on both sides.

478
00:29:48,622 --> 00:29:50,878
Scott: And it's called versus outlaws.

479
00:29:51,261 --> 00:29:52,177
Scott: And it's three dollars.

480
00:29:53,643 --> 00:29:54,560
Scott: And let's see.

481
00:29:54,781 --> 00:29:57,699
Scott: It's a mini RPG of adventure in the Old West.

482
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:00,660
Rym: What kind of system does it use?

483
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,346
Rym: Tristad.

484
00:30:01,772 --> 00:30:02,280
Scott: It's cool.

485
00:30:02,722 --> 00:30:03,460
Scott: I have no idea.

486
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,615
Scott: All I know is that it involves hombres dispensing two fisted justice weights.

487
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,020
Rym: You haven't pirated this thing.

488
00:30:10,563 --> 00:30:11,799
Scott: No, it's it's a card.

489
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:17,182
Scott: It's basically a game written on a piece of cardboard that folds in two places for three dollars.

490
00:30:18,226 --> 00:30:19,733
Scott: But you look at the art on the on the.

491
00:30:19,833 --> 00:30:23,839
Scott: you just look at the art on the cover of this cover of this card.

492
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:29,000
Scott: And yeah, you can't deny that this is some sort of awesome game.

493
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,539
Scott: And apparently they have also made a game called Versus Monsters.

494
00:30:32,681 --> 00:30:34,699
Rym: Ooh, yeah, I'm holding out for pirates.

495
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,360
Scott: Well, it says here is a complete game to play.

496
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,040
Scott: You will need pencils, paper, a deck of playing cards and a fistful of friends.

497
00:30:47,362 --> 00:30:48,788
Rym: You know, so actually I play.

498
00:30:48,828 --> 00:30:52,999
Rym: I was playing NS tonight when I got home from work and I got home from work and I got a lot of stuff to do.

499
00:30:53,341 --> 00:30:54,259
Scott: But buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy.

500
00:30:54,440 --> 00:31:01,401
Rym: I ended up playing some NS and we had basically I thought, oh, I'll play a couple of quick games and then I'll get on to some business and then it's got to come home to do the show.

501
00:31:02,385 --> 00:31:09,291
Rym: And I ended up only playing one game that did not finish because the Marines turtled the turtle and they had.

502
00:31:09,331 --> 00:31:10,840
Rym: but they turtled in two places.

503
00:31:10,922 --> 00:31:11,880
Rym: They had Marine Star.

504
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,239
Scott: Yeah, that's what happens.

505
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:20,540
Scott: And they had the hive directly opposite that, because if you could get the third hive, you could win, but you can't get it and you can't get Marine Star without the third hive.

506
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,887
Scott: So it's just it's it's.

507
00:31:21,908 --> 00:31:25,319
Rym: we had the whole rest of the map and it was one of those maps where you could really lurk it up.

508
00:31:25,621 --> 00:31:28,920
Scott: We had three, but it doesn't matter because they turtled and got heavies.

509
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,845
Scott: Your lurks don't do shit.

510
00:31:29,986 --> 00:31:32,180
Rym: No, they didn't have heavies for a long time.

511
00:31:32,341 --> 00:31:34,757
Scott: But if you don't get them before they get the heavies, you're stuck.

512
00:31:35,621 --> 00:31:35,781
Rym: No.

513
00:31:35,801 --> 00:31:36,424
Rym: So we were fine.

514
00:31:36,444 --> 00:31:44,120
Rym: We had three fades and two lurks and we basically the fades ran in and we're just destroying them at Marine Start and really wrecking them.

515
00:31:44,301 --> 00:31:44,746
Rym: And we were.

516
00:31:44,807 --> 00:31:45,940
Rym: we were on the verge of victory.

517
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:46,522
Scott: Broke the turtle.

518
00:31:46,844 --> 00:31:47,789
Rym: Yes, we were basically.

519
00:31:47,809 --> 00:31:49,700
Rym: well, no, we almost broke the turtle.

520
00:31:50,266 --> 00:31:51,560
Rym: We the lurks were perfect.

521
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,316
Rym: It was like it goes spore, spore, umbra, spore, umbra, umbra, spore.

522
00:31:56,361 --> 00:31:57,432
Scott: Lots of umbras and spores.

523
00:31:57,473 --> 00:31:57,857
Scott: We get it.

524
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,259
Rym: No, but we had a pattern.

525
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,107
Rym: Me and this other lurk.

526
00:32:00,228 --> 00:32:01,320
Scott: Oh, I don't need a pattern.

527
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,243
Rym: Yes, you do.

528
00:32:02,283 --> 00:32:05,920
Rym: Because remember, Umbra and Spore last a certain number of seconds.

529
00:32:06,281 --> 00:32:14,420
Rym: So we had lurks on both sides of Marine Start in two separate hallways getting two opposite sides, protecting the onos and the three fades.

530
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,150
Scott: Oh, that's it.

531
00:32:15,231 --> 00:32:15,780
Scott: It was brilliant.

532
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:21,700
Rym: It was working so well until we found out that one of the hives was under attack.

533
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:28,540
Rym: Someone, while we were focused on destroying and breaking the turtle, had ninja'd out, built two phase gates.

534
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,021
Scott: Yep.

535
00:32:29,061 --> 00:32:31,620
Scott: That's the new strategy these days to build two phase gates.

536
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,480
Scott: That way, even if you rush in to take one down, they come in.

537
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,880
Rym: So we bust up the phase gate in the hive.

538
00:32:37,103 --> 00:32:38,179
Rym: We totally pull it off.

539
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:42,220
Rym: We start to cheer and then they keep coming and they keep coming.

540
00:32:42,481 --> 00:32:45,379
Rym: And then someone yells, oh, my God, there's another phase gate at four.

541
00:32:46,521 --> 00:32:47,224
Rym: And it was over.

542
00:32:47,906 --> 00:32:56,340
Rym: And the question remains, why am I playing NS when I own Fallout and the Left 4 Dead demo and the new Castlevania game for the DS?

543
00:32:57,803 --> 00:32:59,059
Scott: Because it's better than all those games?

544
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,420
Rym: I don't know if it is better.

545
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:06,143
Rym: Basically, the point of this show, what we're trying to figure out here is what is wrong with us?

546
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:10,540
Rym: Why do I play NS and Counter Strike and all these old games?

547
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,400
Rym: I was playing Advance Wars on the train today.

548
00:33:13,661 --> 00:33:22,140
Scott: Why is it that I've only watched a mere fraction of all the movies ever created and I've only listened to a mere fraction of the music ever created?

549
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:26,683
Scott: I've only ever read a mere fraction of all the things that have been written in the entire history.

550
00:33:26,723 --> 00:33:28,952
Scott: But you watch Star Wars, Star Wars 10,000 times.

551
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,885
Scott: I'll watch it again.

552
00:33:31,965 --> 00:33:34,520
Scott: I'll play the same video game over and over again.

553
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,879
Scott: I'll read the same comic book three times.

554
00:33:37,241 --> 00:33:42,920
Rym: You know, I'll read Watchmen, like specifically video games like I mean, NS is even kind of played out.

555
00:33:43,925 --> 00:33:47,140
Rym: I've been playing NS for a long time.

556
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,020
Rym: Like there is no secret in NS.

557
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,000
Rym: Nothing is going to be revealed to me.

558
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:51,401
Scott: I don't know.

559
00:33:51,422 --> 00:33:54,800
Scott: The two phase gates have been sort of recent development, actually.

560
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:59,688
Rym: I don't think it's a recent development so much as a renaissance of tactics from the heyday.

561
00:34:00,135 --> 00:34:00,540
Scott: Possibly.

562
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:09,739
Scott: Because we've got such a- Because a few weeks ago, I started playing NS again like weeks ago and a few weeks ago, people weren't doing the double phase gate.

563
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:18,186
Scott: But like maybe around a week or two ago, like the double phase gate has appeared like a few- like it feels like in my- the games I'm playing, the frequency is increasing.

564
00:34:18,873 --> 00:34:25,005
Rym: So, uh- But it's not like I can say, oh, you know, the argument would be, yeah, well, new games are worse than old games.

565
00:34:25,167 --> 00:34:30,739
Rym: or Rym is elitist and nostalgic and only plays the old games and decides that the new games suck.

566
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,284
Rym: But you know what?

567
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:33,139
Rym: Fallout 3 is awesome.

568
00:34:33,641 --> 00:34:34,998
Rym: I really, really like it.

569
00:34:35,362 --> 00:34:37,178
Rym: When I got it, I played the hell out of it.

570
00:34:37,681 --> 00:34:43,842
Rym: But after like four hours total of gameplay, I still think, wow, that game's really fun.

571
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:49,080
Rym: Man, I really want to bust into Tenpenny's tower and just fuck everything up in there because I don't like that guy one bit.

572
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:57,240
Rym: But I sit down in front of the computer and I open Steam and I'm about to click on Fallout and play like two hours of Fallout.

573
00:34:58,161 --> 00:35:01,260
Rym: And then I click on NS instead, not even consciously.

574
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,920
Rym: It's like I want to play Fallout.

575
00:35:03,302 --> 00:35:07,480
Rym: I end up playing NS and I feel more satisfied at the end of the NS game.

576
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,583
Scott: Yeah, definitely.

577
00:35:08,663 --> 00:35:16,020
Scott: I mean, I got, you know, that Wario game, which is great, you know, but I've also got Mega Man 9, haven't played it at all.

578
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:27,539
Rym: I've been playing a lot of Mega Man 9, but that lends another point to the Rym's just nostalgic pool, because Mega Man 9 is just Mega Man 2 for someone who's played Mega Man 2 so much he's sick of it.

579
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,933
Rym: That's all it is.

580
00:35:28,953 --> 00:35:29,359
Rym: Yeah.

581
00:35:30,064 --> 00:35:30,549
Rym: And I love it.

582
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,500
Rym: Mega Man 9 is great.

583
00:35:31,581 --> 00:35:32,909
Rym: I'm about halfway through it.

584
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,600
Scott: But were you a Mega Man hater?

585
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,853
Rym: No, I was just never good at Mega Man and I didn't.

586
00:35:37,913 --> 00:35:40,545
Rym: I didn't like Mega Man that much, but I didn't hate it.

587
00:35:40,565 --> 00:35:42,353
Rym: I just I liked other games more like.

588
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:45,979
Rym: I like Metal Gear on the NES a little more than I like Mega Man.

589
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,619
Scott: No, you suck.

590
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:47,962
Rym: What?

591
00:35:48,287 --> 00:35:48,917
Rym: Metal Gear.

592
00:35:50,104 --> 00:35:52,060
Scott: So I don't like Metal Gear, right?

593
00:35:53,603 --> 00:35:53,967
Scott: I don't know.

594
00:35:54,048 --> 00:35:55,300
Scott: See, why?

595
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,123
Scott: Let's see what?

596
00:35:56,164 --> 00:36:00,588
Scott: Basically, it's like I'll just be sitting there and I want to play a video game and I got some free time.

597
00:36:00,608 --> 00:36:01,453
Scott: and it's just.

598
00:36:02,055 --> 00:36:02,518
Scott: I don't know that.

599
00:36:02,538 --> 00:36:05,099
Scott: I don't even usually I have a logic to things.

600
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,122
Scott: Right.

601
00:36:06,142 --> 00:36:09,661
Scott: And, you know, there is a logic to the amount of time I spend playing video games.

602
00:36:09,681 --> 00:36:10,264
Scott: You know, I don't.

603
00:36:10,606 --> 00:36:18,021
Scott: I don't let my, you know, feelings sort of allow me to uncontrollably play video games for too many hours, you know, as opposed to doing shit.

604
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:18,664
Scott: You know,

605
00:36:19,406 --> 00:36:32,364
Rym: I've actually broken that instinct because I enjoyed video games a lot more in college when it wasn't a matter of, all right, I'm going to play video games for an hour and then I'm going to do a podcast and then I'm going to braise some chicken to cook some dinner.

606
00:36:33,027 --> 00:36:35,560
Rym: It was all right, I'm going to play Counter-Strike.

607
00:36:35,881 --> 00:36:36,545
Rym: And there was no.

608
00:36:36,565 --> 00:36:38,980
Rym: and then it was just I'm going to play Counter-Strike.

609
00:36:39,261 --> 00:36:41,513
Rym: And at some point I would stop playing Counter-Strike.

610
00:36:41,714 --> 00:36:42,780
Rym: fulfilled, sated.

611
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:43,845
Rym: I had finished.

612
00:36:44,148 --> 00:36:45,700
Rym: Counter-Strike was now done.

613
00:36:46,301 --> 00:36:48,019
Rym: The time for Counter-Strike was over.

614
00:36:48,382 --> 00:36:51,780
Rym: Then I would turn to look at the clock and decide, well, it's now nine thirty.

615
00:36:52,283 --> 00:36:53,338
Rym: What shall I do next?

616
00:36:53,941 --> 00:37:07,820
Scott: Yeah, but my choice of what video game to play is usually just guided by some feeling, you know, it's like I'll just be standing there with all these games arrayed before me and like I just and as has like the feel like, yeah, that's what I want to play.

617
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,040
Scott: And the other ones don't entice me as much.

618
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,040
Scott: And I don't know.

619
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:18,621
Rym: Actually, I think I just realized I keep going back to games that I'm comfortable with.

620
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:35,995
Rym: and but this is strange to me because I really enjoy exploring in games like when I first got the new Castlevania DS, the first one, the one that was basically, yes, Symphony Knight was such a good game that we're going to make that game over and over again forever on the Nintendo DS.

621
00:37:37,387 --> 00:37:38,260
Rym: And that game was great.

622
00:37:38,541 --> 00:37:41,939
Rym: And I played it to the exclusion of all other activities until I beat it.

623
00:37:42,321 --> 00:37:45,699
Rym: And then I played it again in Julius mode until I beat it.

624
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:52,860
Rym: And I just explored and explored and the novelty was great because I hadn't played a game like that in a long time and I love games like that.

625
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:59,838
Rym: But I don't know, I've played two of those games and I have the new Castlevania, haven't touched it, haven't even put it in my DS.

626
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:05,219
Rym: And while I know it's a great game, it's exactly what I want and it's comfortable to me.

627
00:38:05,821 --> 00:38:10,757
Rym: But at the same time, I don't know, the novelty of exploring that kind of world is almost lost to me.

628
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:22,080
Rym: And even if like a new Advance Wars game came out, I almost feel like my desire to play in my comfort zone is coming from the fact that I want to perfect a game.

629
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:27,040
Rym: I want to take a game that has this kind of skill cap and reach that skill cap.

630
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:34,518
Rym: So I keep playing Advance Wars that I'm only 90% perfect at instead of playing the new game that I have no desire to ever be perfect at.

631
00:38:35,221 --> 00:38:48,740
Scott: Well, I think there's something to that, you know, the for example, like when I play like the Castlevania games, right, like the first DS one, I just beat it and then I beat like the second ending and then the second one came out and I beat it.

632
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,900
Scott: But I didn't get the second ending.

633
00:38:50,001 --> 00:38:52,800
Scott: And then I tried to play Symphony of the Night, which I never played before.

634
00:38:53,282 --> 00:38:56,882
Scott: And I was able to beat, you know, the first half of the game and get to the upside down castle.

635
00:38:57,284 --> 00:39:00,823
Scott: But then after getting a bit into the upside down castle, I sort of stopped playing.

636
00:39:00,903 --> 00:39:01,406
Scott: And it's like.

637
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,880
Scott: there are certain, you know, they're good.

638
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,023
Scott: There's good gameplay.

639
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:10,485
Scott: Exploring a 2D world a la Castlevania, a la Super Metroid is good gameplay.

640
00:39:10,565 --> 00:39:12,080
Scott: I kind of I like that kind of game.

641
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:20,580
Scott: It's a good kind of game, but there's only so much that I can replay that particular type, you know, gameplay type.

642
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:26,420
Scott: It's not so much now the where before a whole game would be, you know, replay value.

643
00:39:26,641 --> 00:39:30,260
Scott: Now it's the type of gameplay that it is, is the replay value.

644
00:39:30,341 --> 00:39:32,099
Scott: So it doesn't matter if it's a new one.

645
00:39:32,521 --> 00:39:38,479
Scott: It's I'm doing the same thing as I was doing in the old one or doing the same thing that I was doing in level two as in level one.

646
00:39:38,961 --> 00:39:43,476
Scott: So I can only take so much side scrolling 2D exploring before.

647
00:39:43,537 --> 00:39:44,500
Scott: I don't want any more.

648
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:51,727
Scott: And there's something about certain games like NS or what other games can I go back to all the time?

649
00:39:51,748 --> 00:39:52,778
Scott: I punch out.

650
00:39:53,180 --> 00:40:04,500
Scott: Yeah, punch out where where even though this is gameplay that I have had a whole bunch of, somehow this type of gameplay tastes good every time.

651
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:09,023
Scott: Like you can only eat so much of one kind of food before you don't want that kind of food anymore.

652
00:40:09,103 --> 00:40:15,260
Scott: But you can just eat steak, one hundred steaks, and you can still want more steaks like, you know, Wario.

653
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,220
Scott: It's like I'm rocking the Wario.

654
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,163
Scott: I'm probably going to beat it.

655
00:40:18,264 --> 00:40:23,980
Scott: But it's like if I get to a part that's sort of hard, it's like I sort of want to stop playing.

656
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:28,240
Rym: But well, I remember you had that problem with the newest, newest advanced wars.

657
00:40:28,562 --> 00:40:30,980
Rym: Once you hit that owl, you just had no desire to continue playing.

658
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,363
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

659
00:40:31,383 --> 00:40:33,740
Scott: I got to the owl and I'm just like, well, fuck this, you know.

660
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:42,185
Rym: I'll admit the only reason I got past the owl before I just said, you know what, this isn't worth it, was that I beat the owl on my first try with a B because you just suck at advanced wars.

661
00:40:42,286 --> 00:40:44,000
Scott: No, no, no.

662
00:40:44,501 --> 00:40:45,540
Scott: The owl just sucks.

663
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:46,919
Rym: No, the owl doesn't suck.

664
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,660
Rym: Believe me, you think the owl sucks.

665
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,900
Rym: The mission after it is a thousand times more annoying.

666
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:52,898
Scott: I could beat the owl.

667
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,980
Scott: It's just I didn't have the patience for it.

668
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,260
Scott: It's like I didn't want to sit.

669
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,598
Scott: It's like I knew what I had to do.

670
00:40:58,082 --> 00:41:00,640
Scott: But I didn't want to actually sit there doing it.

671
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:12,399
Scott: That's actually a problem I have with a lot of my job is like when I'm making software, I really like, you know, designing software and trying to solve software problems and figure out how things work and figure out how to fix something.

672
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:18,900
Scott: But it's like once I figured it out, then you actually have to type in the code that makes that happen.

673
00:41:19,081 --> 00:41:21,780
Scott: And that part doesn't really require thinking as much.

674
00:41:21,861 --> 00:41:23,600
Scott: It's it's a different part of the brain.

675
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:27,740
Scott: It feels more like manual labor, like it's just, oh, you know, I already.

676
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:28,999
Scott: No, that I have to.

677
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,500
Scott: This is how it needs to be done.

678
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:34,600
Scott: Why should I have to actually sit here for an hour just moving my fingers up?

679
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:38,780
Rym: But at the same time, why do we play punch out over and over and over and over again?

680
00:41:39,623 --> 00:41:41,440
Rym: I know how to beat everyone in the game.

681
00:41:41,801 --> 00:41:44,900
Scott: I've played punch out, but you can't beat everyone in the game, can you?

682
00:41:45,224 --> 00:41:46,140
Rym: I can get almost to the end.

683
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,339
Rym: I never I never legit.

684
00:41:47,581 --> 00:41:49,820
Scott: I can get to the second Don Fomenko.

685
00:41:49,983 --> 00:41:50,899
Scott: That's as far as I can get.

686
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:55,460
Rym: I've eaten him, but I've never gotten from the beginning of the game to Mike Tyson.

687
00:41:55,943 --> 00:41:58,360
Rym: But I've beaten my ties and starting on my time.

688
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,420
Rym: When did you beat my days when I was a kid?

689
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,339
Rym: I used the code again.

690
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,839
Scott: Let's see you beat Mike Tyson now.

691
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:03,245
Rym: Yeah.

692
00:42:03,265 --> 00:42:04,079
Rym: You know how I beat him?

693
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,639
Rym: I used the code to get to him.

694
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:05,981
Rym: Right.

695
00:42:06,384 --> 00:42:08,899
Rym: And I'd someone told me exactly how to beat him.

696
00:42:09,322 --> 00:42:12,580
Rym: And I remember I just played over and over and over.

697
00:42:12,801 --> 00:42:17,320
Rym: I just played against Mike Tyson constantly until once I beat him just barely.

698
00:42:18,963 --> 00:42:20,360
Rym: Yeah, it's actually not that hard.

699
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,680
Rym: He's easier than some other people.

700
00:42:22,184 --> 00:42:23,340
Scott: There's there's like a second awful.

701
00:42:23,842 --> 00:42:24,564
Scott: I can't second.

702
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:29,500
Rym: Don Fomenko is not harder than Mike Tyson, but he's not that much easier.

703
00:42:30,482 --> 00:42:31,247
Scott: He's pretty rough.

704
00:42:31,468 --> 00:42:33,240
Scott: You know, super macho man's also really tough.

705
00:42:33,621 --> 00:42:40,248
Rym: But even then, like even if I could beat punch out without even trying, I feel like Bionic Commando.

706
00:42:40,289 --> 00:42:40,900
Rym: There's an example.

707
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,080
Rym: The original Bionic Commando.

708
00:42:42,562 --> 00:42:47,280
Rym: I can beat that game in like twenty five minutes without even like thinking about it, like without even expending effort.

709
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:52,580
Rym: And yet I will periodically put Bionic Commando into my Gameboy and beat it.

710
00:42:52,941 --> 00:42:57,340
Rym: Like on the way home, on the train, I'll just beat Bionic Commando and then take a nap.

711
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,200
Scott: Well, you check this out, right?

712
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,991
Rym: I usually then again, is that like exercising?

713
00:43:02,071 --> 00:43:04,663
Rym: or just is that my equivalent of mindless activity.

714
00:43:04,723 --> 00:43:08,542
Rym: instead of, you know, playing the mindless Sudoku, I beat the mindless Bionic Commando.

715
00:43:08,562 --> 00:43:09,167
Scott: That's just is.

716
00:43:09,247 --> 00:43:11,160
Scott: I always make fun of Sudoku people, right?

717
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,539
Scott: Because I'm like, you know, what's the point of doing Sudoku?

718
00:43:13,861 --> 00:43:17,153
Scott: I can write a computer program that solves any Sudoku.

719
00:43:17,233 --> 00:43:21,800
Scott: trivially would take me like a few hours, you know, and I already know how it would be written.

720
00:43:21,881 --> 00:43:24,720
Scott: It's so it's such a it's a solved problem.

721
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:27,460
Scott: It's like you already know how this thing is done.

722
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:33,360
Scott: You're just doing the work, just like I complained that, you know, typing in the code is doing the work, not solving the problem.

723
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:38,783
Scott: But, you know, Picross, I don't know if most people know how to play Picross, but it's really.

724
00:43:38,823 --> 00:43:40,740
Scott: it's just a different kind of, you know, puzzle.

725
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:41,442
Scott: It's really not.

726
00:43:41,703 --> 00:43:41,824
Scott: it's.

727
00:43:41,924 --> 00:43:46,405
Scott: it's not the same thing as Sudoku, but it's, you know, effectively the same kind of thing.

728
00:43:46,465 --> 00:43:50,244
Scott: It's you figure out which squares to fill in and which ones not to fill in.

729
00:43:50,607 --> 00:43:52,019
Scott: And a picture shows up at the end.

730
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:58,899
Scott: And, you know, I never was able to actually play Sudoku before just because I never had the patience to figure out exactly how to do it.

731
00:43:59,382 --> 00:44:03,100
Scott: And then I got a puzzle book on the way home from Seattle.

732
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:03,803
Scott: I said, you know what?

733
00:44:03,864 --> 00:44:07,220
Scott: I'm going to freakin do a Picross, not Sudoku.

734
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,700
Scott: I know how to do a Picross.

735
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:11,600
Scott: And I'm like, I'm going to do fucking Picross for for for reals.

736
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:12,162
Scott: And I did it.

737
00:44:12,222 --> 00:44:20,640
Scott: And I'm like, oh, and there's something about even though, you know, it's busy work, I already know I can write a computer program to solve every Picross ever.

738
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:21,669
Scott: It's it's trivial.

739
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:22,719
Scott: I could do in a few hours.

740
00:44:23,341 --> 00:44:35,442
Scott: But for some reason, my body likes doing Picross and I got Picross DS and I just keep solving Picrosses even though it's really easy and I can write a computer program to do it.

741
00:44:35,483 --> 00:44:36,240
Scott: It's just busy work.

742
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:42,120
Scott: So how come I don't like doing the busy work of typing in code, but I love doing the busy work of doing Picross?

743
00:44:43,261 --> 00:44:49,520
Rym: It's I don't know, but the thing is, I feel like this with Bionic Commando, it's not so much a mindless entertainment when I think about it.

744
00:44:49,905 --> 00:44:50,780
Rym: It's like exercise.

745
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,600
Rym: It's like I've got to keep my skill alive.

746
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:57,200
Rym: Otherwise I'll lose it because I feel like I'm retraining that muscle.

747
00:44:58,002 --> 00:45:01,060
Scott: But I don't feel like I'm retraining my Picross muscle.

748
00:45:01,701 --> 00:45:01,884
Scott: Maybe.

749
00:45:01,905 --> 00:45:02,739
Scott: What do I need that for?

750
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:05,800
Rym: Maybe you just enjoy mindless entertainment.

751
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,780
Scott: But I usually don't, except for Picross.

752
00:45:10,642 --> 00:45:13,040
Rym: See, the thing is, I don't like Picross at all.

753
00:45:13,401 --> 00:45:16,019
Rym: I don't get the enjoyment anyone could get from it.

754
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,720
Scott: I don't know either, but I just I keep wanting to do it.

755
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:19,463
Rym: I don't know why.

756
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:22,577
Rym: I have no desire at all to do, but I don't want to do.

757
00:45:22,657 --> 00:45:24,639
Scott: anything else is mindless except Picross.

758
00:45:25,801 --> 00:45:28,900
Scott: I'm not even like, you know, excited to see the picture that shows up at the end.

759
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,300
Scott: I just go, yeah, OK, it's a squid.

760
00:45:30,401 --> 00:45:30,663
Scott: Great.

761
00:45:30,724 --> 00:45:31,189
Scott: Next picture.

762
00:45:31,209 --> 00:45:32,118
Scott: Huh?

763
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:33,651
Rym: Maybe you're just crazy.

764
00:45:33,873 --> 00:45:34,319
Scott: I don't know.

765
00:45:35,201 --> 00:45:35,783
Scott: I don't know.

766
00:45:36,687 --> 00:45:39,800
Rym: See, I think at least I. there's two factors here.

767
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:53,760
Rym: I mean, when I play Advance Wars again, I've what I'm doing is I'm perfecting the game like I'm basically beating like the last three things that I don't have an S in just to get an S and to prove to myself that I am perfect at this game.

768
00:45:53,920 --> 00:46:09,580
Rym: I'm actually I have this goal of being absolutely perfect at Advance Wars such that no matter when I play Advance Wars, at least the most recent iteration of Advance Wars, I can play it 100 percent perfectly and know that if I win, I won because I'm perfect.

769
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,699
Rym: And if I lose, I lost because it was impossible to win.

770
00:46:15,503 --> 00:46:17,680
Rym: I feel like that's the only reason I'm playing Advance Wars.

771
00:46:18,221 --> 00:46:23,104
Rym: And for some reason, I guess I value that more highly than the novelty of playing a new Castlevania game.

772
00:46:23,204 --> 00:46:42,440
Scott: Well, I think actually, you know, novelty is a big part of it, because when you play something like, you know, NS, even though I've played a million NS games and I know how most of them are going to go, something about playing NS, it feels like constant novelty, just because the way the game is, you know, you don't fully know, you know, there could be a Marine in the vent.

773
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:56,524
Scott: There might not be, you know, it's the game, even though it's the same maps with the same people in the same strategies, it feels like constant novelty where even something like a new Castlevania game, even though it's full of novelty, I have no idea the shape of the map.

774
00:46:56,565 --> 00:46:57,539
Scott: I don't know what the rooms are.

775
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,469
Scott: I don't know what the story is.

776
00:46:58,570 --> 00:46:59,540
Scott: I don't know what the weapons are.

777
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:00,534
Scott: I know nothing about it.

778
00:47:00,676 --> 00:47:00,920
Scott: Right.

779
00:47:01,542 --> 00:47:20,396
Scott: Because I've played other Castlevania games, even the things in the new one that are novel and new don't feel novel because I've you know, it's like I've seen similar enough things enough times to where the novelty isn't novel anymore and I need some other kind of novelty for it to work.

780
00:47:21,784 --> 00:47:22,878
Rym: But then again, I don't know.

781
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,123
Rym: It's hard to say.

782
00:47:24,144 --> 00:47:29,180
Rym: I keep saying it's hard to say because I'm not 100 percent sure what drives my gaming motivation anymore.

783
00:47:29,821 --> 00:47:30,063
Scott: Yeah.

784
00:47:30,103 --> 00:47:32,540
Scott: How come, you know, I'm still wanting to play board games.

785
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:33,940
Scott: You don't want to play board games anymore.

786
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,320
Rym: I want to play board games all the time.

787
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,151
Rym: We just need more people.

788
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:39,360
Scott: Regricola is a great two player game.

789
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:42,196
Rym: Yeah, but I have more desire to play Puerto Rico or T&E.

790
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,760
Rym: I could play T&E any time.

791
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:49,532
Rym: In fact, there has never been a point in my life where someone said, hey, you want to play T&E?

792
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:50,322
Scott: That is true.

793
00:47:50,402 --> 00:47:56,780
Scott: But if they, you know, you have a choice, you don't have a choice between Agricola and Puerto Rico unless there are three people.

794
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:59,060
Scott: If there are two people, you don't have the choice.

795
00:47:59,080 --> 00:47:59,706
Rym: But that's the thing.

796
00:47:59,787 --> 00:48:01,120
Rym: I value that choice so highly.

797
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,879
Rym: It's kind of like how I want to play an FPS.

798
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:03,442
Rym: All right.

799
00:48:03,462 --> 00:48:03,947
Rym: Tribes, too.

800
00:48:03,967 --> 00:48:05,199
Rym: I can't play tribes, too.

801
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:06,041
Rym: Damn it.

802
00:48:06,403 --> 00:48:09,820
Rym: I'm not going to play, I don't know, Half-Life 1 Deathmatch.

803
00:48:10,081 --> 00:48:16,379
Rym: If that's the only FPS I can play, I'll just hold off until I can play Tribes 2 again or until someone makes a magical new game.

804
00:48:16,922 --> 00:48:18,320
Scott: But then you're just not going to play anything.

805
00:48:18,721 --> 00:48:20,040
Rym: Yeah, but that's my problem.

806
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,380
Rym: But see, there's the thing.

807
00:48:21,682 --> 00:48:23,200
Rym: It's not like we're not playing games.

808
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:29,905
Rym: You can't say, oh, we're being jaded or anything because I'm playing more PC and DS games than ever right now.

809
00:48:30,025 --> 00:48:33,380
Rym: I'm just, I'm playing Advance Wars and Natural Selection.

810
00:48:34,402 --> 00:48:53,074
Scott: I think that the main thing about it that makes me feel really bad is there was a point at which every video game I owned, even though not as good ones, I had beaten, you know, relatively completely, you know, or at least beaten to enough satisfaction to where I didn't feel like, you know, I spent money on that game and then didn't get my money's worth because I didn't play the

811
00:48:53,094 --> 00:48:53,359
Rym: whole thing.

812
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,165
Rym: Oh, that's the worst.

813
00:48:54,346 --> 00:48:57,880
Rym: Lately, I've been getting about three quarters of the way through a lot of games and then just not caring.

814
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:58,944
Scott: Yeah, like Bioshock.

815
00:48:58,985 --> 00:49:04,640
Scott: It's like I got pretty far in Bioshock, you know, and I even paid for it instead of playing Rimskopi and whatnot.

816
00:49:05,463 --> 00:49:10,263
Scott: And I got to a certain point that it sort of stopped playing and didn't start playing again.

817
00:49:10,343 --> 00:49:13,019
Scott: And it's sort of like, oh, I paid for that and I didn't.

818
00:49:13,421 --> 00:49:16,280
Scott: It's like buying a fancy dinner and not eating at all.

819
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,560
Scott: It's like, oh, I didn't eat at all.

820
00:49:18,261 --> 00:49:23,902
Rym: I guess once I beat a second Big Daddy, I just had there was no reason to play that game anymore.

821
00:49:24,244 --> 00:49:33,206
Scott: Well, the thing I think the thing that got me is I went really far through the game and, you know, made some sort of some major plot things happen, you know, relative to what was going on.

822
00:49:33,266 --> 00:49:35,420
Scott: And I barely killed any Big Daddies.

823
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,340
Scott: I'd somehow like there were tons of them all over the place.

824
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:43,622
Scott: I just like avoided them or, you know, use the thing that lets you control them and stuff like that.

825
00:49:43,682 --> 00:49:48,140
Scott: And didn't actually I maybe got like the the Adam for maybe like two girls.

826
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:48,844
Scott: And that was it.

827
00:49:49,788 --> 00:49:51,980
Scott: And it just wasn't working out for me.

828
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:53,091
Scott: And I was just like, eh, whatever.

829
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:57,300
Scott: And I just never had any desire to pick it up again.

830
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:01,420
Scott: But it it feels bad because video games are expensive and I do pay for them.

831
00:50:02,021 --> 00:50:06,260
Scott: And if I don't play the whole thing, it's like, oh, that that's not it's not good.

832
00:50:07,022 --> 00:50:11,403
Scott: I need to play the whole thing somehow because otherwise I'm wasting all this money all over the place.

833
00:50:11,503 --> 00:50:14,900
Scott: But I think I'm just going to stop buying new video games.

834
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:19,164
Scott: Left 4 Dead is going to be it after Left 4 Dead and not buying any video games like beat everything I got.

835
00:50:19,646 --> 00:50:23,283
Rym: It didn't help that I got really burned by Team Fortress 2.

836
00:50:23,283 --> 00:50:26,240
Rym: I mean, I was looking forward to that game for a decade.

837
00:50:26,962 --> 00:50:27,892
Rym: A decade.

838
00:50:28,175 --> 00:50:28,660
Rym: It came out.

839
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:29,760
Rym: I bought it sight unseen.

840
00:50:30,662 --> 00:50:32,795
Rym: It had maybe 10 hours of play.

841
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,795
Scott: You played it a lot more than 10 hours.

842
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:37,420
Rym: No, actually, look at my steam.

843
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,378
Rym: I didn't play it that long.

844
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,259
Scott: Yeah, you played it a lot.

845
00:50:40,401 --> 00:50:41,170
Scott: A lot more than me.

846
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:41,879
Rym: You know what?

847
00:50:42,221 --> 00:50:46,100
Rym: After the show, I'll go into my steam and I'll find out exactly how long I played it.

848
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,053
Scott: All right, we'll do that.

849
00:50:47,074 --> 00:50:47,500
Scott: Be interesting.

850
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:47,941
Rym: I had it.

851
00:50:48,323 --> 00:50:51,900
Rym: I had no more than 10 hours of good play and then a little bit of residual.

852
00:50:52,322 --> 00:50:54,535
Rym: I have to prove to myself that I'm good at this game before.

853
00:50:54,555 --> 00:50:55,300
Rym: I never play it again.

854
00:50:55,401 --> 00:50:56,479
Rym: And then I just haven't touched it.

855
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:56,861
Scott: Yeah.

856
00:50:56,962 --> 00:50:57,123
Scott: Yeah.

857
00:50:57,163 --> 00:50:59,460
Scott: Someone I am the other day is like Left 4 Dead demos out.

858
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,084
Scott: Why are you playing?

859
00:51:00,145 --> 00:51:02,320
Scott: And I'm like, because it was a tiny demo.

860
00:51:02,441 --> 00:51:03,960
Scott: I beat the whole thing two or three times.

861
00:51:04,342 --> 00:51:05,207
Scott: I don't need to play it anymore.

862
00:51:06,254 --> 00:51:07,180
Scott: Why should I play it again?

863
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,480
Scott: I can play NS, which will be as a full game.

864
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:10,374
Scott: That'll be, you know what, though?

865
00:51:12,443 --> 00:51:13,039
Rym: Honestly, really?

866
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:22,760
Rym: The reason I play NS still, if I really think about it and I think back to why I've been enjoying it is that it's such a good game.

867
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:42,840
Rym: And but more importantly, it's not played out that in terms of novel content, there is still novel content because the community is so excellent that I have a new like meme or funny saying or weird conversation every time I play like the people are the innovative content.

868
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:43,481
Scott: Yeah.

869
00:51:43,501 --> 00:51:46,520
Scott: And I think that's why, you know, we're talking about DLC early in the show.

870
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,520
Scott: And I said I much prefer UGC, which is the user generated content.

871
00:51:50,520 --> 00:52:08,080
Scott: And I think, you know, the games like Line Rider, which isn't really a game, but like Little Big Planet and games like that, where, you know, the players, you know, it's really less of a game and more of just a focused creative tool.

872
00:52:08,662 --> 00:52:11,720
Scott: You know, I think that's where the business is at.

873
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,640
Scott: You know, it's not, you know, DDR, can you dance these arrows?

874
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:18,260
Scott: It's DDR, make arrows to your favorite song.

875
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:22,591
Rym: It's, you know, well, also the social aspect of DDR.

876
00:52:22,812 --> 00:52:26,020
Rym: playing alone in my room, I really only do for exercise and practice.

877
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:34,640
Rym: But the real fun of DDR is playing on a boardwalk at an arcade with your posse, all your friends in public hanging out with the people.

878
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:45,300
Rym: And as wouldn't, I probably wouldn't really play NS that much if it weren't for the fact that I there's these great people to interact with and the gameplay itself is reliant on that interaction.

879
00:52:46,383 --> 00:52:51,440
Scott: I mean, you know, that's a lot of people say about the wow and such is like, oh, it's all about, you know, the people.

880
00:52:51,741 --> 00:52:53,199
Scott: It doesn't matter that the game is crap.

881
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:57,339
Scott: The thing is, I really think you just need both because the game is crap.

882
00:52:58,021 --> 00:52:59,787
Scott: Even if there's people there, why am I?

883
00:52:59,807 --> 00:53:03,300
Scott: I could go and do a different a good game and have people.

884
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:10,180
Scott: And that's I can't really think of any game that has the combination of both being good other than NS.

885
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,040
Scott: It has the people.

886
00:53:11,662 --> 00:53:13,700
Scott: And at the same time, the game is amazing.

887
00:53:14,062 --> 00:53:17,939
Scott: Everything else seems like have people with a bad game, like, wow.

888
00:53:18,401 --> 00:53:22,560
Scott: Or maybe it's a great game, but it's a single player game like Fallout three or something.

889
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:23,322
Scott: There's no people.

890
00:53:24,487 --> 00:53:27,480
Scott: What other game has the people and the great game?

891
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:35,300
Rym: The thing is, the people in NS, all the conversation in NS, all the interaction is within the context of the game.

892
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,400
Rym: There's never a meta conversation.

893
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,000
Rym: No one ever like you see people playing.

894
00:53:39,081 --> 00:53:39,444
Rym: Wow.

895
00:53:39,787 --> 00:53:41,200
Rym: Or, you know, I just I'm hanging out.

896
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:41,581
Scott: I don't know.

897
00:53:41,621 --> 00:53:48,000
Scott: I play NS and people are talking about Obama, but it's usually they're saying Obama while they're biting someone to the rhythm of their biting.

898
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,065
Rym: But see, that's still.

899
00:53:50,205 --> 00:53:52,780
Rym: it's contextualized by the rhythmic play.

900
00:53:53,582 --> 00:53:56,320
Rym: Like I've never heard the just generic conversation for playing.

901
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,880
Rym: Someone's like, yeah, so what do you want to do after the game?

902
00:53:59,182 --> 00:54:00,660
Rym: Let's go get some food, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

903
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,459
Rym: It's like people are going to play bejeweled while I wait.

904
00:54:04,081 --> 00:54:07,200
Rym: Most of the conversation in NS is in the game itself.

905
00:54:07,481 --> 00:54:13,820
Rym: People saying funny things in the context of the game, yelling at other people for choosing OC as the tower.

906
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:21,160
Rym: Oh, see, oh, the game I was playing, we had an early fade like right away.

907
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,480
Rym: This dude killed a bunch of people.

908
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:28,180
Rym: So we fade right away, like so early in the game that it was ludicrous and there was no way we could lose.

909
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,427
Scott: I got next time.

910
00:54:29,548 --> 00:54:31,020
Scott: So I got the strategy.

911
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:34,280
Scott: Next time, Alien, I'm just going to get the five reds and go look immediately.

912
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:35,330
Scott: I'm not going to wait around.

913
00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:36,440
Rym: I do that almost every game.

914
00:54:36,742 --> 00:54:37,024
Scott: I do.

915
00:54:37,105 --> 00:54:39,120
Scott: I gorge right away and build the MC immediately.

916
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:39,926
Scott: That's what I've been doing.

917
00:54:39,946 --> 00:54:41,298
Rym: I'm going to be a real good lurk.

918
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:42,041
Scott: I'm lurking.

919
00:54:42,081 --> 00:54:42,383
Scott: All right.

920
00:54:42,764 --> 00:54:46,579
Rym: But basically the guys like, could someone please drop an MC?

921
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,519
Rym: Could someone please drop an MC?

922
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:54,300
Rym: For the love of God, I'm afraid we can win this.

923
00:54:54,481 --> 00:54:55,207
Rym: Drop an MC.

924
00:54:55,428 --> 00:54:56,840
Rym: Fast forward 10 minutes.

925
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,064
Rym: Jesus Christ.

926
00:54:58,265 --> 00:55:01,060
Rym: Someone drop an MC for the love of motherfucking shit.

927
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:02,706
Scott: Ten minutes.

928
00:55:02,787 --> 00:55:03,091
Scott: Really?

929
00:55:03,112 --> 00:55:03,740
Scott: Ten minutes.

930
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,239
Scott: You lost if it was 10 minutes.

931
00:55:05,441 --> 00:55:10,740
Rym: No, we were just because as someone else pointed out, it's OK, man.

932
00:55:11,184 --> 00:55:12,153
Rym: I dropped an OC.

933
00:55:12,213 --> 00:55:12,920
Rym: I got you covered.

934
00:55:15,541 --> 00:55:16,866
Scott: That's even funnier if you know.

935
00:55:16,986 --> 00:55:20,819
Scott: the game is, you know, an OC cost the same amount of resource points as an MC.

936
00:55:21,121 --> 00:55:23,179
Scott: So he could have built an MC instead of the OC.

937
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:28,380
Rym: But the game, I guess the game itself, interaction aside, is also not played out.

938
00:55:28,481 --> 00:55:29,819
Rym: It's it's getting close.

939
00:55:30,382 --> 00:55:33,900
Rym: It's definitely near the end of possible gameplay.

940
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:42,960
Rym: But there are enough turnabouts and enough different strategies and that the game on a tactical and learning level is not played out.

941
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:51,040
Rym: And as long as I feel I've never even commanded effectively, as long as a game, I guess, is not done for me tactically.

942
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:56,060
Rym: As long as I can learn something new in the context of the game, then a game is still worth playing.

943
00:55:56,121 --> 00:55:57,740
Rym: And I can still learn things in NS.

944
00:55:58,162 --> 00:55:59,820
Rym: I can still learn things in Advance Wars.

945
00:56:00,421 --> 00:56:09,120
Rym: I can still learn things in Punch-Out because I could be better at Punch-Out and I can still learn things in Maena Commando because I could beat it faster.

946
00:56:09,802 --> 00:56:12,620
Rym: I'm about eight minutes short of a legitimate speed run.

947
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:15,926
Rym: Legitimate, as in.

948
00:56:16,067 --> 00:56:18,099
Rym: I could call it a speed run with a straight face.

949
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:19,021
Scott: Yeah.

950
00:56:19,041 --> 00:56:22,000
Rym: So I think a perfect speed run, I think, is like twenty five minutes.

951
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,099
Rym: So if I beat it in a half hour, that's pretty damn good.

952
00:56:24,701 --> 00:56:24,921
Scott: Yeah.

953
00:56:24,941 --> 00:56:29,840
Scott: But anyway, Left 4 Dead seems like it's going to be the answer because for a while I've wanted to play a game.

954
00:56:30,041 --> 00:56:32,780
Scott: Like Serious Sam, which is, you know, FPS is pretty.

955
00:56:36,043 --> 00:56:37,320
Rym: That was the best part of the game.

956
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:37,702
Rym: Yeah.

957
00:56:37,722 --> 00:56:39,680
Scott: FPS is pretty much come in a few flavors.

958
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:40,702
Scott: You know, there's the.

959
00:56:41,764 --> 00:56:49,280
Scott: but anyway, one of the flavors of FPS is the millions of bad guys everywhere hoes them down flavor, which is the Doom flavor and the Serious Sam flavor.

960
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:52,000
Scott: And Left 4 Dead seems to be in that flavor.

961
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,200
Scott: It's not like one of those creepy, crawly zombie games like Resident Evil.

962
00:56:55,301 --> 00:56:58,360
Scott: It's a flood of zombies hoes them down without dying.

963
00:56:58,421 --> 00:57:00,220
Scott: And it's just four person co-op.

964
00:57:01,082 --> 00:57:06,620
Scott: And I feel like, you know, I played the demo and I'm definitely going to play through, which means I've already played the whole thing.

965
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:09,720
Scott: Well, actually, I think the demo is available today for everyone, even if you haven't paid for it.

966
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,740
Rym: But yeah, but I'm honestly I'm just going to wait for the real game.

967
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:21,200
Rym: The demo is the real game is just like, well, two levels of the rest of the game, because my worry is that once I play Left 4 Dead, I might play it out.

968
00:57:21,321 --> 00:57:21,786
Rym: And then what?

969
00:57:22,028 --> 00:57:23,200
Scott: Well, I think that's what's going to happen.

970
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:27,360
Scott: It feels to me like there is a multiplayer component, but I don't have a lot of confidence in it.

971
00:57:27,741 --> 00:57:38,360
Scott: You know, even though I haven't played it, I think I'm just going to end up playing the entire, you know, single player thing, you know, with a four person co-op and just hosing down all the zombies in one go.

972
00:57:38,583 --> 00:57:39,719
Scott: And then that'll be the end of that.

973
00:57:40,161 --> 00:57:45,600
Scott: And then I'm going to not buy any video games until I beat all the ones I've got that I haven't beaten yet.

974
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:50,620
Scott: I'm going to go and beat the Bioshock and the Super Paper Mario and the Wario game.

975
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:51,184
Rym: But here's the thing.

976
00:57:51,486 --> 00:57:53,380
Rym: Do you really want to beat Bioshock?

977
00:57:53,541 --> 00:57:57,620
Rym: Like, will you enjoy it or you're going to beat it because you paid for it?

978
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:58,478
Rym: Will it be a chore?

979
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:00,062
Rym: I don't know.

980
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:04,100
Rym: I think it'll be a chore because I fired up Bioshock again recently.

981
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:08,520
Rym: And while I was playing, I was like, wow, I'd rather be playing Fallout.

982
00:58:08,882 --> 00:58:12,680
Rym: And then when I went to play Fallout, wow, I'd rather be playing Tribes 2.

983
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,200
Rym: I can't play Tribes 2.

984
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:18,534
Scott: As an example, you know, Bioshock really sort of felt the reason I stopped playing.

985
00:58:18,554 --> 00:58:20,600
Scott: Bioshock is sort of the same reason I stopped playing.

986
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,059
Scott: I never beat Golden Sun 2, even though I love Golden Sun.

987
00:58:23,701 --> 00:58:32,940
Scott: Is that I got to a point in Golden Sun 2 where I sort of had to manage all these items, just the chore of managing all those items was more was sort of unfun.

988
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:36,640
Scott: But the idea of restarting felt really fun.

989
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:49,940
Scott: And I feel like maybe I'll just end up restarting Bioshock and doing it, you know, better and actually trying to kill the Big Daddies, all of them or something, instead of, you know, just fooling around and dodging all of them and rushing through the plot.

990
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:56,760
Rym: Well, see, that's the one thing about Fallout that makes it a lot more fun than a game like Bioshock, even because it feels similar playing it.

991
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:01,260
Rym: But in Fallout, I don't feel this need to beat the game.

992
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:06,500
Rym: Well, I feel this need to poke it all the bits, not that I need to beat the game.

993
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:14,300
Scott: Well, it's that if you get to a certain point in the game, you know, you can and you haven't done things up then until properly.

994
00:59:14,721 --> 00:59:19,977
Scott: Suddenly the game is bleh, where if you had done it a different way, the game would not be bleh at this point.

995
00:59:20,017 --> 00:59:21,080
Scott: The game would still be rocking.

996
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:22,784
Rym: Yeah, but I feel I don't know.

997
00:59:22,904 --> 00:59:27,260
Rym: Other games seem to pace that better such that I can't get myself into that situation.

998
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,766
Scott: Sort of like imagine if you were playing, say, Half-Life 2, right?

999
00:59:30,826 --> 00:59:38,900
Scott: And you got to a certain point in the game and you just, you know, decided that in this part of the game you were going to just hose all the bad guys down with, you know, just use all your ammo.

1000
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:41,347
Scott: Then the next part of the game, you don't have enough ammo.

1001
00:59:41,387 --> 00:59:45,840
Scott: Well, now it sort of sucks because you don't have used all your ammo and there isn't enough lying around.

1002
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:49,870
Rym: Yeah, but the thing is Half-Life was paced such that that never happened.

1003
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:53,840
Rym: You'd have to really, really screw up to run out of ammo.

1004
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:57,071
Scott: And that's what made it a good game that I could, you know, beat twice.

1005
00:59:57,111 --> 00:59:59,380
Scott: I beat Half-Life 2 twice because it was that good.

1006
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:00,664
Rym: Of course, I haven't even beaten it.

1007
01:00:01,105 --> 01:00:05,980
Rym: I'm at the end and I just lost all desire to play because I'm playing NS instead.

1008
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:14,280
Scott: Yeah, I think these games where it's possible to be in a situation where you put yourself in a way that you don't want to play anymore.

1009
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:20,220
Scott: I think that's something bad about the game because it doesn't happen in other games like Portal or Half-Life 2 or whatever.

1010
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:24,731
Scott: You just, you always want to keep going no matter how you've played up until now.

1011
01:00:25,172 --> 01:00:27,960
Scott: You're at this point and you still want to play ahead.

1012
01:00:28,461 --> 01:00:42,220
Scott: Whereas in a game like Bioshock, it's like, I would want to play forward if I had done something different previously and thus I could only move forward actually by starting again from the beginning and getting back to this point by following a different path.

1013
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:52,800
Rym: Well, I feel like a part, it's just all the games I still play, there's some sort of competitive or social element independent of the tactical part.

1014
01:00:53,141 --> 01:01:01,358
Rym: Maybe not completely independent, but Bionic Commando, I play it partly because I can show off by beating it in front of other people and they go,

1015
01:01:01,418 --> 01:01:01,698
Rym: "Wow.".

1016
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:03,343
Rym: NS, duh.

1017
01:01:03,443 --> 01:01:08,280
Rym: It's a multiplayer FPS with goals and it's asymmetric and it's great.

1018
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:13,007
Rym: Bioshock, eh, there's no interactive component.

1019
01:01:13,528 --> 01:01:18,800
Rym: I'm never going to have a story or an anecdote to tell someone about the crazy thing that happened in Bioshock.

1020
01:01:19,261 --> 01:01:20,404
Rym: At least Fallout has that.

1021
01:01:20,444 --> 01:01:27,340
Rym: I mean, me and Daryl Surratt were swapping crazy, funny Fallout stories just because Fallout's a game that lends itself to that.

1022
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:38,280
Scott: I think that's part of the user-generated content is not just you make something in a game, it's that when you're playing of a game, it's a unique experience.

1023
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:44,780
Scott: As opposed to say, if I watch Star Wars and you watch Star Wars, our experiences are pretty much the same unless someone in the room does something silly.

1024
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:56,140
Rym: But if I play Fallout once and you play Fallout once, I totally shot this dude and stole his gun and then blew up the mansion and you went into the mansion and made friends with the guy and raised an army.

1025
01:01:57,763 --> 01:02:05,618
Scott: It's like you have these completely unique experiences that are things that belong to you that you can share from the game.

1026
01:02:07,161 --> 01:02:10,907
Scott: It's all about those unique personal experiences.

1027
01:02:10,987 --> 01:02:13,871
Scott: that is the reason to play a game more.

1028
01:02:14,132 --> 01:02:19,580
Scott: If the game keeps churning out more things like that, you'll keep cranking it to get more things to come out.

1029
01:02:20,121 --> 01:02:24,500
Scott: Every time I play NS, there's something great that's going on, so I'll keep cranking it and cranking it.

1030
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:27,340
Rym: Every time I play NS, something unexpected happens.

1031
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:30,700
Scott: There's no story for me to tell about what happened when I was playing Wario Shake.

1032
01:02:31,441 --> 01:02:38,035
Rym: I could do a whole show on awesome things that happened in the last week of playing NS, like when we ambushed that Fade.

1033
01:02:38,355 --> 01:02:40,620
Rym: That was the most epic moment of NS I've ever had.

1034
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:44,620
Scott: Or when there was a one hour long turtle deadlock and we quit.

1035
01:02:45,221 --> 01:02:46,224
Rym: We couldn't even finish it.

1036
01:02:46,444 --> 01:02:48,911
Rym: If we were in college, we would have stayed to the end.

1037
01:02:49,773 --> 01:02:52,360
Rym: You realize if that had gone all night, we would have been there.

1038
01:02:54,222 --> 01:02:54,804
Scott: But we just quit.

1039
01:02:54,825 --> 01:02:58,220
Scott: Imagine the server had crashed, but it didn't.

1040
01:03:00,061 --> 01:03:11,400
Rym: You know, the NS community being what it is, I can imagine everyone rejoining and purposefully like no one kills each other and we recreate the stalemate and then continue the game.

1041
01:03:13,201 --> 01:03:14,727
Rym: NS is a game where that would happen.

1042
01:03:15,410 --> 01:03:18,000
Rym: It could though, because things like that happen.

1043
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,660
Scott: No, because even the peace knife gets no respect anymore.

1044
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,420
Rym: No, I was in a game.

1045
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:24,935
Scott: I had it respected a little bit, but eventually they get you.

1046
01:03:24,976 --> 01:03:25,680
Scott: They don't let you go on.

1047
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:33,040
Rym: It was in a game on Saturday where we were playing and suddenly one of the Marines types all knives.

1048
01:03:34,821 --> 01:03:41,420
Rym: And sure enough, everyone had knives out and the skulks, they didn't respect the peace knife because it wasn't a peace knife.

1049
01:03:41,981 --> 01:03:48,280
Rym: But there was basically this jets versus knife fight in the street outside of Marine Start.

1050
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:52,360
Rym: And then after this ended, everyone kind of went through separate ways and then the game continued.

1051
01:03:54,281 --> 01:03:56,729
Rym: I've never seen that happen again, but it happened.

1052
01:03:57,130 --> 01:03:58,394
Rym: This one unique thing happened.

1053
01:03:58,655 --> 01:03:59,578
Rym: It didn't happen to Scott.

1054
01:03:59,598 --> 01:04:00,200
Rym: It happened to me.

1055
01:04:00,761 --> 01:04:02,168
Rym: I have a weird story to tell.

1056
01:04:02,188 --> 01:04:04,680
Rym: That's never going to happen in Wario Shake.

1057
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:08,525
Scott: But not only do you have a weird story to tell, but it was.

1058
01:04:08,906 --> 01:04:16,240
Scott: you had that weird story while you were playing a game that also made you think and had quality stuff going on in and of itself.

1059
01:04:16,821 --> 01:04:25,720
Scott: Also, you could you were trying to win at something that required you actually exercise parts of your brain and got the awesomeness on the side.

1060
01:04:26,261 --> 01:04:28,560
Scott: The dreaded combination of undefeatableness.

1061
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:41,340
Rym: Yeah, I think part of it, too, I keep saying part of it, but another part, yet another, suffice to say, et cetera, and so on, is that when I play NS, there's there's so many people who are good at the game within the community.

1062
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:48,580
Rym: Like the percentage of people who play NS, the percentage of those people who are good at it is very, very, very high.

1063
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:50,849
Scott: Yeah, there's hardly anyone playing the game who's no good.

1064
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:52,456
Scott: It's a complicated game.

1065
01:04:52,496 --> 01:04:53,400
Scott: It's hard for noobs to learn.

1066
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:59,110
Rym: Like I could play T and E, you know, me and Scott and two noobs, and that could be fun, but it wouldn't be a test of skill.

1067
01:04:59,210 --> 01:05:04,940
Rym: It'd be a test of like teaching the game to someone effectively or making the game fun for these people.

1068
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:09,380
Scott: And whether I win or Rym wins is pretty much who can take advantage of the noobs the most.

1069
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:19,000
Rym: But NS has been around for so long and the people playing it have been playing it for so long that we've kind of, it's kind of like when, say I want to talk about movies with someone.

1070
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:36,100
Rym: If we've both seen 10, not 10,000, a thousand movies and know like the full history of film, we can have a conversation entirely different from the conversation that we could have if a person in the room or the person we were talking to had only seen four movies.

1071
01:05:37,041 --> 01:05:38,344
Rym: And didn't even know, couldn't name.

1072
01:05:38,365 --> 01:05:41,052
Scott: like a single person in the room is an AI.

1073
01:05:41,092 --> 01:05:43,739
Scott: that's completely predictable and you know what it's going to do every time.

1074
01:05:44,421 --> 01:05:44,702
Rym: Yep.

1075
01:05:44,882 --> 01:05:47,833
Rym: It's going to say Casablanca was a great movie.

1076
01:05:48,094 --> 01:05:49,600
Rym: It amounted to a hill of beans.

1077
01:05:50,401 --> 01:06:01,260
Rym: Yeah, but, and as the conversation, and I mean this in the kind of high level sense, not in the I'm holding down V and talking sense.

1078
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:13,920
Rym: The conversation I have in the context of the game between myself and the other players is very high level because we can assume that everyone knows how to play or that the majority of people know how to play.

1079
01:06:14,341 --> 01:06:15,684
Rym: That they're good at playing.

1080
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:22,520
Rym: That if I drop sense first, the other players will react to that and the strategy of the game will be different.

1081
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:30,580
Rym: It's kind of like the difference between playing chess with someone else who is your same skill level at chess versus playing chess with someone who's never heard of chess.

1082
01:06:31,781 --> 01:06:35,712
Rym: You have to, like you move your rook, but he doesn't understand the ramifications of that.

1083
01:06:35,933 --> 01:06:38,279
Rym: So all of your strategy goes out the window and you just beat him.

1084
01:06:39,342 --> 01:06:46,133
Scott: It also helps that, you know, when people in other games, you know, the shit cockery doesn't exist in the natural selection world.

1085
01:06:46,193 --> 01:06:50,080
Scott: I mean, you know, maybe once in a blue moon, there'll be a shit cock, right?

1086
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:55,510
Scott: But for the most part, some people do exhibit shit cock tendencies, but they're always like in humor.

1087
01:06:55,671 --> 01:07:00,480
Scott: Like someone will start playing some music and it's like all mans and everyone is all mans.

1088
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:01,929
Rym: Really?

1089
01:07:02,111 --> 01:07:02,800
Rym: Honestly?

1090
01:07:04,241 --> 01:07:04,442
Scott: Yeah.

1091
01:07:04,462 --> 01:07:08,615
Scott: Instead of, whereas in Counter-Strike, someone will start playing music and it's like, all right, just dude, shut up.

1092
01:07:08,776 --> 01:07:09,037
Rym: Fuck.

1093
01:07:09,619 --> 01:07:09,839
Rym: Fuck.

1094
01:07:11,102 --> 01:07:12,239
Scott: Racial slur, racial slur.

1095
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:12,968
Rym: Yup, yup.

1096
01:07:14,441 --> 01:07:16,838
Scott: Whereas in NS, it's like racial slur on mans.

1097
01:07:19,342 --> 01:07:19,866
Rym: The cheese.

1098
01:07:19,886 --> 01:07:21,700
Rym: The cheese says everything about NS.

1099
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:22,540
Scott: The cheese is the greatest.

1100
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:24,124
Rym: But I don't know.

1101
01:07:24,244 --> 01:07:29,740
Rym: I'm going to keep playing NS unless something causes me to play another game.

1102
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:30,819
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what I'm going to do.

1103
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:37,799
Rym: And maybe if we get, the only thing that could break this is if we get tribes two going, but again, old game.

1104
01:07:38,921 --> 01:07:40,979
Scott: And where are you getting a 40 people who are really good at it?

1105
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:41,441
Scott: I know.

1106
01:07:41,501 --> 01:07:50,280
Rym: I mean, if we make a server of tribes two, pretty much what it's going to be is like 10 people, five on a team and a whole bunch of bots.

1107
01:07:50,782 --> 01:07:53,519
Rym: And if we're on the same team, we'll just win and it won't be fun.

1108
01:07:53,821 --> 01:08:02,820
Scott: And where will we, you know, it's not just the problem of getting enough people and getting enough people who are good, it's getting people who are willing to go to figure out how to get it to work technologically.

1109
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:11,000
Rym: Not just that, but to play the game long enough to get to the point where the conversation we'll have inside the game will be high level.

1110
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:26,479
Rym: I mean, the great part about tribes was when, you know, I'm flying strike backup for the transport full of heavies that is going to suddenly burst out of the clouds and descend upon the enemy base that Scott has just blown up the generators for.

1111
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:39,447
Rym: That level of play, that level of coordination would require like four months of preparation and play of just all the people who have never played this game before learning the basics of the game.

1112
01:08:39,687 --> 01:08:44,380
Rym: We can't even have the high level conversation until they all have their own low level conversation.

1113
01:08:45,661 --> 01:08:54,760
Rym: And as because there's still a community around it, I can have the high level conversation faster than the time it takes to start a game of Civ 4.

1114
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:57,488
Rym: I can snap my fingers, I'm in a high level game.

1115
01:08:59,533 --> 01:09:01,880
Rym: Oh my god, I want to play Anus right now and I think I should.

1116
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:05,120
Scott: Well, we probably will, but I need to eat something or I'm going to die.

1117
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:06,277
Rym: Alright, I think we're done here.

1118
01:09:06,965 --> 01:09:08,319
Scott: I still eat before I play a video game.

1119
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:08,921
Scott: Stay tuned!

1120
01:09:09,723 --> 01:09:17,620
Rym: We're probably going to do a show tomorrow and Thursday to make up for the lack of shows last week, but don't hold us to that, stay tuned and we're done.

1121
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:18,358
Scott: We'll see what happens.

1122
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:27,109
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1123
01:09:27,210 --> 01:09:29,660
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

1124
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:41,540
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontroadcrew.com where you'll find show notes, links, our awesome forum, a link to our Frapper map, and links to all the RSS feeds.

1125
01:09:42,142 --> 01:09:47,779
Rym: We say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week covering four different brands of geekery.

1126
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:49,988
Rym: Mondays are science and technology.

1127
01:09:50,048 --> 01:09:52,339
Rym: Tuesdays we have video games, board games, and RPGs.

1128
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:58,420
Rym: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights, and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

1129
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:06,940
Scott: You can send us feedback by email to geeknights@frontroadcrew.com or you can send audio feedback via Odeo.

1130
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:10,460
Scott: Just click the link that says "send me an Odeo" on the right side of our website.

1131
01:10:10,881 --> 01:10:15,980
Rym: If you like what you hear, you can catch the last 100 episodes in iTunes or in your favorite podcatcher.

1132
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:19,340
Rym: For the complete archives, visit the website which has everything.

1135
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:36,780
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1136
01:10:37,222 --> 01:10:40,340
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
