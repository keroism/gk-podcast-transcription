00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:14,311
Rym: it's Wednesday October 4th 2017.

2
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:19,982
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights spooky GeekNights.

3
00:00:20,002 --> 00:00:24,289
Rym: tonight we're talking about Scooby-doo.

4
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:33,952
Rym: great you were the one who wanted to do like a Halloween theme this month.

5
00:00:34,213 --> 00:00:36,160
Scott: yeah but the theme was a good idea.

6
00:00:36,261 --> 00:00:37,427
Scott: the thing is like always.

7
00:00:37,467 --> 00:00:39,056
Scott: I don't have any actual episode ideas.

8
00:00:39,177 --> 00:00:43,392
Scott: oh no and limiting us to a very specific set of ideas.

9
00:00:43,613 --> 00:00:53,323
Scott: you sometimes you know we say you know limitation boost creativity but in this case it just makes it even harder to come up with an episode idea because you might come up with a good one it's not spooky.

10
00:00:53,364 --> 00:00:53,826
Scott: and then what?

11
00:00:54,128 --> 00:00:55,113
Rym: ah but I could well one.

12
00:00:55,134 --> 00:00:58,207
Rym: we'll put that in a Google keep somewhere and then forget about it.

13
00:00:58,347 --> 00:01:03,143
Rym: that's right but too much more important we are.

14
00:01:03,484 --> 00:01:12,458
Rym: I can kind of skirt it by just doing the ephemera of spooky voice in the beginning and make the music a little bit putting too much effort.

15
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,021
Scott: all right.

16
00:01:13,121 --> 00:01:14,045
Rym: yeah thank you.

17
00:01:14,086 --> 00:01:17,040
Rym: I think you vastly overestimate how much effort that took.

18
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:29,090
Scott: last weekend down town East village ish area there was a I guess it was this place called the spoke gallery.

19
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,639
Scott: it's one of those one-room art galleries.

20
00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:30,941
Scott: you know the?

21
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:33,234
Scott: yeah I've seen those where they have a showing.

22
00:01:33,274 --> 00:01:43,018
Scott: they put everything up on the wall and then they everything's for sale and then they put in another show and people have parties there and stuff right you know that kind of place.

23
00:01:43,138 --> 00:01:52,362
Scott: yeah they had a one weekend it was Friday night was the gallery opening party whatever but then Saturday and Sunday was the come check out the gallery and then that was it.

24
00:01:52,422 --> 00:01:55,815
Scott: but it was a Miyazaki art gallery.

25
00:01:55,935 --> 00:01:59,267
Scott: obviously no art by actual Miyazaki just art by other people.

26
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:01,857
Scott: you know of Miyazaki things.

27
00:02:01,937 --> 00:02:04,928
Scott: it was mostly Princess Mononoke's Totoro's.

28
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,779
Scott: yeah he's now she goes the popular ones.

29
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:11,831
Scott: I didn't see any of the less popular ones really you know.

30
00:02:11,851 --> 00:02:15,783
Scott: but yeah it was definitely some cool stuff there.

31
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:21,971
Scott: there was a thing where there was a big giant Totoro mural and there was a red umbrella and you could take a picture next to it.

32
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:29,859
Scott: yeah and there was like a lamp that was made by like cutting white paper into boxes.

33
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:35,295
Scott: that were concentric boxes and then there's a light bulb in the middle.

34
00:02:35,316 --> 00:02:36,379
Scott: it was way cool.

35
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:38,447
Scott: yeah there's a lot of good stuff there.

36
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:43,449
Scott: if you didn't go yeah sorry you don't live here and can't do stuff like that.

37
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:48,297
Rym: well similarly because you know in New York there's basically sort of a Ghibli thing where every year.

38
00:02:48,317 --> 00:02:51,027
Rym: you can just see pretty much every Ghibli movie in the theater.

39
00:02:51,067 --> 00:03:05,357
Scott: G kids now owns the the US I think I don't know even broader than that but they definitely own the US distribution rights to all like if not all almost all studio Ghibli films.

40
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:14,793
Scott: so and I think they're putting them all back out on Blu-ray DVD whatever it is but they also put them in theaters like constantly.

41
00:03:14,893 --> 00:03:23,512
Scott: so even if you're not in New York City if you're somewhere near I guess a populated area that's populated enough that G kids will put it in a theater there.

42
00:03:24,195 --> 00:03:25,702
Scott: you got chances to see these things.

43
00:03:25,742 --> 00:03:31,329
Scott: so follow G kids on Twitter Instagram whatever yeah and you'll get notified about these things.

44
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:52,409
Rym: so a while ago I watched Lapita again and just just recently me and Emily we didn't go to the exhibit you went to but we went and saw Nausicaa which I've seen it before several times but I'd never seen it in a theater with a really good projection mm-hmm because when I've seen it in the theater is usually an original film print.

45
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:57,112
Rym: but this was like a nice digital projection and it was basically perfect.

46
00:03:57,132 --> 00:04:05,876
Rym: like it was as good a quality as you're ever gonna see that movie in a theater I don't think you could get it a better quality and something that kind of stood out.

47
00:04:05,936 --> 00:04:06,639
Rym: I really enjoyed it.

48
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:10,102
Rym: I'm actually really glad I went to see it because I noticed a bunch of stuff I never noticed before.

49
00:04:10,543 --> 00:04:18,564
Rym: but comparing it to Lapita I I think Lapita is for me at least a better movie.

50
00:04:18,644 --> 00:04:19,769
Scott: Lapita was came before.

51
00:04:19,809 --> 00:04:21,957
Rym: not yeah yeah but Lapita.

52
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:30,350
Rym: so the differences I really noticed was that Nausicaa despite how long it is really bit off a lot of story to try to tell.

53
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:36,134
Rym: well even that it only covered covered the first volume of an even longer manga.

54
00:04:36,194 --> 00:04:36,817
Scott: yeah that's the thing.

55
00:04:36,837 --> 00:04:38,706
Scott: is it was it was cover it was trying to cover this.

56
00:04:38,907 --> 00:04:43,649
Scott: Lapita was basically I think was based on something I don't know what but it wasn't like.

57
00:04:44,031 --> 00:04:47,585
Scott: you know abridging some you know grand story.

58
00:04:47,645 --> 00:05:02,800
Rym: right yeah wherever now Nausicaa is an abridged version of this gigantic epic manga even what it like the tiny piece it tried to tell it still struggled to fit all that into a couple hours because it is a long ass movie.

59
00:05:04,302 --> 00:05:09,464
Rym: it's two full hours long which I guess I've always known and I always forget until I watch it again.

60
00:05:10,587 --> 00:05:31,664
Rym: but what was interesting is that Nausicaa actually had it really doesn't trust the audience to understand what the hell's going on and the characters repeatedly remind you what the plot is and really really explain everything multiple times whereas Lapita when I because I saw it again recently as

61
00:05:31,705 --> 00:05:32,509
Scott: well as going on and

62
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:34,398
Rym: does both doesn't explain shit.

63
00:05:34,438 --> 00:05:36,146
Rym: the world is similarly complicated.

64
00:05:36,487 --> 00:05:40,848
Rym: but rather than explaining it all they'll just be like a little bit of stuff in the background.

65
00:05:40,869 --> 00:05:43,966
Rym: that implies all of that and if you don't notice that well fuck you.

66
00:05:43,986 --> 00:05:54,949
Rym: the only thing I noticed that was kind of interesting was that Nausicaa has really good characters and really it's the story of those characters having their arcs.

67
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:58,001
Scott: you mean the the flying space pirate people.

68
00:05:58,703 --> 00:06:10,420
Rym: meanwhile Lapita has also a flying space pirate people who don't really progress or change or have arcs and Lapita is much more about the world than the characters.

69
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:17,934
Rym: that's true and I like they're both really good for different reasons but I feel like Lapita actually had a better soundtrack.

70
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:26,670
Rym: I feel like the soundtrack was better mastered and I enjoy the subtlety of the environmental storytelling of Lapita and while Nausicaa

71
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,637
Scott: I enjoy the robots of Lapita yeah

72
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:44,259
Rym: but like the environment like the world of Lapita is really interesting and subtly told and you could miss a lot of what's implied by the background stuff and the world around it Nausicaa is like hey this is what this world is about.

73
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,867
Rym: hey this is what these things are about.

74
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:53,039
Rym: but then it sort of skips past all that to focus on these characters and how fucking badass Nausicaa herself is.

75
00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:56,974
Scott: yeah we rewatched the castle of Akagliostrum.

76
00:06:57,154 --> 00:06:58,640
Rym: oh my god I should watch that again.

77
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,844
Rym: it's been too long uh-huh.

78
00:07:00,065 --> 00:07:08,904
Scott: so I got a booray rip from Yarr pirate me because I couldn't find any legal means of watching it other than buying a booray.

79
00:07:09,406 --> 00:07:13,277
Scott: and yeah that looks way better than the version I've seen before.

80
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:22,126
Rym: I think the first time I saw Akagliostro was literally a dubious fan sub at RIT anime out of VHS.

81
00:07:22,287 --> 00:07:26,651
Scott: the one thing that I noticed this time because it wasn't I didn't really notice sub.

82
00:07:26,752 --> 00:07:42,069
Scott: obviously everything we're talking about is subtitles of course one thing I noticed this time compared to any previous time that I watched it was that you know usually in a lot of LuPone movies right the good ones is where you know.

83
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:46,851
Scott: it shows you how Zenigata is a badass but LuPone is just even more badass.

84
00:07:46,891 --> 00:07:50,811
Scott: yeah that's the only reason he can't catch him but he could catch anyone else no problem right?

85
00:07:51,413 --> 00:07:56,158
Scott: oh and in some of them people making those LuPone movies don't understand that.

86
00:07:56,198 --> 00:07:58,408
Scott: and they make Zenigata to be out to be like a dum-dum.

87
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,054
Scott: yeah like a derpader.

88
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:02,445
Scott: you know Barney Fife kind of cop.

89
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:04,093
Rym: yeah you can't make him that way.

90
00:08:04,113 --> 00:08:10,319
Scott: yeah no in Castle of Akagliostro I didn't realize but he is the good way in that movie oh yeah.

91
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,276
Scott: and also his screen time in that movie is basically like second.

92
00:08:15,737 --> 00:08:20,580
Scott: you know it's like Jigen and Goemon have almost Jigen's in the beginning then he's basically gone.

93
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,052
Scott: once he gets the anti-tank rifle you don't see right.

94
00:08:24,272 --> 00:08:31,177
Scott: Goemon appears out of nowhere does almost nothing cuts like two things and that's it right.

95
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:36,336
Scott: and Fujiko is important but is also barely there in the movie.

96
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,460
Scott: it's really also she.

97
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:38,023
Rym: it's good.

98
00:08:38,063 --> 00:08:40,195
Rym: Fujiko like she just is a good guy in this one.

99
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:48,889
Scott: oh yeah but it's basically you know LuPone one Zenigata two and in that movie and also the bad guy he's just like the stupid count guy.

100
00:08:48,909 --> 00:08:52,646
Scott: yeah but the henchman ninja guy oh yeah I forgot about him.

101
00:08:52,806 --> 00:08:53,570
Scott: they're way.

102
00:08:53,631 --> 00:08:56,143
Scott: no not him the whole group of them with the pointy claws.

103
00:08:56,484 --> 00:09:01,160
Scott: they are way creepier and super more dangerous than I remembered.

104
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:12,711
Rym: well that that place that they're all in is real dangerous like LuPone yeah as badass as he is and Zenigata as bad as that's the real number one character in the movie is Cagliostro the place.

105
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:22,000
Rym: yeah that's what it's actually but I always appreciated in that movie how LuPone is a badass and this place is dangerous like it almost killed him before and it feels like it might kill him this time.

106
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:31,135
Rym: yeah and Zenigata is ostensibly a cop and he's safe there but the reality is that he is in just as much danger as LuPone just by being there.

107
00:09:31,296 --> 00:09:32,059
Scott: yeah

108
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:42,079
Rym: I think my two favorite scenes that entire movie are that with your sword and my anti tank rifle yeah and when LuPone is wearing the scuba stuff and he's in the

109
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:42,621
Scott: fountain

110
00:09:42,943 --> 00:09:53,158
Rym: and Zenigata just leans over and almost sees him like that's the moment of yeah LuPone you're clever but Zenigata is like yeah a second like one

111
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,122
Scott: degree

112
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:57,457
Rym: angle away from catching you mm-hmm I can.

113
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,948
Rym: well I think we gotta watch that movie again watch it.

114
00:09:59,988 --> 00:10:05,996
Rym: now she go again pump me up in a big way cuz that was real good despite the I had some of them.

115
00:10:06,016 --> 00:10:08,083
Rym: I mean there's issues with the movie but we've reviewed it before.

116
00:10:08,104 --> 00:10:14,082
Rym: I think you want to go through all the one at a time.

117
00:10:14,223 --> 00:10:16,674
Scott: we should almost all of them.

118
00:10:16,754 --> 00:10:17,919
Rym: I'll check to see if there's any.

119
00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:19,086
Rym: we haven't given a fully.

120
00:10:19,126 --> 00:10:22,803
Scott: things I haven't seen are like ocean waves and my neighbor the Yamada's.

121
00:10:22,903 --> 00:10:24,768
Rym: and you saw.

122
00:10:24,788 --> 00:10:25,389
Rym: I think we saw.

123
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:30,924
Rym: oh it's so up on poppy Hill and the air.

124
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:31,868
Scott: what's the airplane one?

125
00:10:31,909 --> 00:10:33,597
Scott: that's not Porco Rosso the newer one.

126
00:10:33,617 --> 00:10:38,574
Rym: oh I thought oh that's a real fucking good movie.

127
00:10:38,594 --> 00:10:39,738
Scott: I don't think I saw that one.

128
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:50,733
Rym: it's it's the hardest one to watch because it is really really real and brutal and it's about a really situation.

129
00:10:50,753 --> 00:10:52,540
Scott: all right let's continue with our GeekNights here.

130
00:10:52,761 --> 00:10:56,001
Rym: okay but I will say I've been about be hell really even enjoyable when you watch it.

131
00:10:56,884 --> 00:10:59,856
Rym: but I defy anyone to remember the name of any character.

132
00:11:00,258 --> 00:11:02,169
Scott: I can't never the characters and he was in good things.

133
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,686
Rym: you won't remember anything that happens enough on poppy Hill.

134
00:11:04,746 --> 00:11:06,015
Rym: it's good and then you'll forget it.

135
00:11:06,076 --> 00:11:08,145
Rym: it's like eating a really good candy anyway.

136
00:11:08,646 --> 00:11:09,729
Rym: so yeah got any news.

137
00:11:10,391 --> 00:11:11,114
Scott: I do have a news.

138
00:11:11,214 --> 00:11:23,117
Scott: so Katie cook who we have mentioned on GeekNights before but not in a very long time she is a person who's just like a really amazing artist who does stuff.

139
00:11:23,237 --> 00:11:24,722
Rym: yes follow her on Twitter.

140
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:29,303
Scott: she's like she goes like a zillion comic cons every year and hits up the artist alley.

141
00:11:30,226 --> 00:11:31,429
Scott: other things that she's done.

142
00:11:31,449 --> 00:11:34,037
Scott: there's a book ABC 3po.

143
00:11:34,057 --> 00:11:39,778
Scott: yeah oh yeah she does a lot of official Star Wars arts and things for properties.

144
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:47,190
Scott: like if you buy Star Wars trading cards like there'll be cards in there that are hand-drawn by her like randomly inserted zones.

145
00:11:47,271 --> 00:11:52,547
Scott: and she has a webcomic Gronk which is about a little green monster whatever.

146
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:55,134
Scott: but anyway she has a new webcomic.

147
00:11:56,318 --> 00:11:58,986
Scott: what's it called?

148
00:11:59,307 --> 00:12:00,150
Rym: nothing special?

149
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,634
Scott: nothing I guess it's nothing special.

150
00:12:03,119 --> 00:12:07,406
Scott: but the interesting thing about this is that you know obviously you got to read this cuz Katie cook webcomic.

151
00:12:07,446 --> 00:12:12,568
Scott: but the thing that's interesting is that this is up online webtoon right.

152
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:23,770
Scott: so if you don't know what the deal is right is in the United States we have Google right and Google is provide search and services right in Korea South Korea.

153
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:31,237
Scott: obviously there's a company called neighbor and neighbor provides search and content like it's really like.

154
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:35,172
Scott: from what I can tell it's like it's the only site you need to go to.

155
00:12:35,232 --> 00:12:38,142
Rym: really yeah now there's obviously like.

156
00:12:38,684 --> 00:12:41,732
Rym: that would be a problem in America.

157
00:12:41,752 --> 00:12:50,199
Scott: but anyway one of the things that they provide neighbor is line which is sort of I guess the idea.

158
00:12:50,219 --> 00:12:51,243
Scott: it's like a chat service.

159
00:12:51,303 --> 00:13:06,910
Scott: in fact in Times Square there's like a line store that sells character goods of the characters that they made that are in the emojis the stickers in line like the duck if you see these characters or know them like the yellow duck with a little tiny beak in the middle okay

160
00:13:07,613 --> 00:13:08,336
Rym: okay

161
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:08,999
Scott: but I'm not.

162
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:13,682
Scott: I can't tell apart the cow cow talk characters from the line characters but whatever.

163
00:13:14,967 --> 00:13:18,420
Scott: but another thing they do is webcomics and webcomics are way way big.

164
00:13:19,264 --> 00:13:28,566
Scott: in South Korea like a webcomic artist could be like a famous person who appears on TV there's actually a webcomic artist I've seen on like cooking shows doing cooking.

165
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,476
Scott: we've got famous by doing webcomics.

166
00:13:30,898 --> 00:13:34,491
Scott: imagine if you saw Mike and Jerry on like NBC on a cooking show.

167
00:13:34,992 --> 00:13:35,855
Scott: it's like what the hell.

168
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,958
Scott: but no so this even though it's not Korean is that same service right?

169
00:13:42,018 --> 00:13:48,458
Scott: but doing webcomics in the US publishing them and that's really quite fascinating.

170
00:13:49,099 --> 00:13:49,923
Scott: what's up with that?

171
00:13:51,088 --> 00:13:51,751
Scott: what are the comics?

172
00:13:51,771 --> 00:13:52,675
Scott: they got on there?

173
00:13:52,795 --> 00:13:53,117
Scott: right?

174
00:13:53,157 --> 00:13:59,869
Scott: what's going on with this?

175
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:12,789
Scott: so you might have seen Toblerone's all over Twitter lately in an anime contest all the Toblerone's on Twitter first and then it took like a week to figure out what the all the deal was.

176
00:14:12,849 --> 00:14:17,010
Scott: and then after I figure out the deal was on the way home for that Miyazaki exhibit.

177
00:14:17,311 --> 00:14:28,356
Scott: there was an empty storefront with big glass panes for you know walls you just glass walls basically and those glass panes are filled 100% with two giant advertisements for this show.

178
00:14:28,376 --> 00:14:30,182
Scott: yeah which is hilarious.

179
00:14:30,964 --> 00:14:41,215
Rym: so yeah basically the story is if you wonder what the hell was up with that is that there's this anime and it is on Netflix only.

180
00:14:41,376 --> 00:14:47,335
Rym: but it is an anime produced by Japanese animation studios and such for Netflix.

181
00:14:47,676 --> 00:14:50,328
Scott: but can you watch it anywhere in the world that has Netflix?

182
00:14:50,389 --> 00:15:02,033
Rym: or only if I know I have not watched it it's called neo-yokio which is a real bad name and as far as I can tell it's a bunch of weeb nonsense amped up to 11 all right.

183
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:07,833
Rym: and the reason it's interesting is that it's Jaden Smith's anime.

184
00:15:07,894 --> 00:15:12,512
Scott: Jaden Smith if you don't know is Will Smith son and he's a really interesting dude.

185
00:15:12,693 --> 00:15:17,155
Scott: yeah because like on the one hand like I guess he has some kind of skill.

186
00:15:17,175 --> 00:15:18,884
Scott: he was in that created cardi kid movie.

187
00:15:18,924 --> 00:15:23,100
Scott: right he has some sort of acting celebrity talent of some kind.

188
00:15:23,521 --> 00:15:25,730
Scott: he has fans of some kind.

189
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,115
Scott: you know he has some popularity.

190
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,546
Scott: yeah as far as I know hasn't done anything evil.

191
00:15:29,566 --> 00:15:30,512
Scott: there's no reason to hate him.

192
00:15:31,478 --> 00:15:41,544
Scott: you know you might not be a fan of him because you know you're not a fan of everyone but whatever but he has been known to say some crazy things like he's definitely a nerdy weeb type person.

193
00:15:41,965 --> 00:16:00,083
Rym: he said some things in the past like he's gonna be a combination of nerdy weeb super fashion and already rich so living this sort of jet-set life and those three combined into this weird amalgam of an internet personality.

194
00:16:00,103 --> 00:16:01,047
Scott: I guess your dad as well.

195
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,935
Scott: yeah it's like all right.

196
00:16:03,738 --> 00:16:05,266
Scott: but yeah I guess Netflix.

197
00:16:05,286 --> 00:16:08,842
Scott: I don't know if Netflix got him to do this show or if he got Netflix to do this.

198
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:26,821
Rym: yeah I didn't look into the deal but this show he's the I can tell because most of the memes the internet shit I saw about this show was like so ridiculous nonsense that I assumed it was people making fun of the show.

199
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:29,912
Rym: but it appears that the show is literally like that mm-hmm.

200
00:16:30,795 --> 00:16:32,381
Rym: and what's the plot?

201
00:16:32,421 --> 00:16:33,305
Rym: the plot is ridiculous.

202
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:47,174
Rym: Jaden Smith plays Kaz Khan a so-called majestic rat who works as a demon exterminator maybe watch this with his and Agatha played by Susan fucking Sarandon.

203
00:16:47,455 --> 00:16:48,359
Scott: well Netflix has money.

204
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:54,411
Rym: but yeah maybe I should watch this which is interesting because you know what Susan Sarandon was also in recently what Rick and Morty.

205
00:16:54,692 --> 00:16:59,092
Rym: okay and she's doing voice acting and she's really good at it.

206
00:16:59,273 --> 00:17:02,350
Scott: probably her agent is like yeah let's get some voice acting where it gets real easy.

207
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,376
Scott: you get some money all right.

208
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:17,201
Rym: hangs out with his friends Lexi Gottlieb and his rival arch Angelo Corelli for the title of most eligible bachelor and it's just fucking crazy as far as I can tell.

209
00:17:17,883 --> 00:17:26,056
Rym: okay some like dinky anime cons are already like denying content about this show claiming it's not anime and there's anime register like.

210
00:17:26,096 --> 00:17:26,719
Rym: it's not anime.

211
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:27,422
Rym: it's Jaden Smith.

212
00:17:28,223 --> 00:17:29,207
Scott: it's anime.

213
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:32,959
Rym: whether you like it or not mmm that is the matter.

214
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:36,854
Scott: I do not really care if it's technically anime or not.

215
00:17:37,135 --> 00:17:38,520
Scott: that is a pedantic argument.

216
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,993
Scott: it is technically anime I have no interest in.

217
00:17:43,394 --> 00:17:50,604
Scott: what I do have interested is that it is hilarious that this exists and it is good to know about even if you're not gonna watch it.

218
00:17:50,624 --> 00:17:53,100
Rym: yep I feel like we will review it at some point.

219
00:17:53,301 --> 00:17:55,590
Rym: oh yeah avoid that kind of thing.

220
00:17:55,851 --> 00:17:56,915
Scott: it's just too hilarious.

221
00:17:56,935 --> 00:17:59,405
Scott: yeah good or bad it could be the worst thing ever.

222
00:17:59,425 --> 00:18:00,931
Rym: there's no way.

223
00:18:00,951 --> 00:18:01,855
Scott: there's no way.

224
00:18:01,935 --> 00:18:06,473
Scott: this cannot be one of those things that's actually bad boring bad.

225
00:18:06,513 --> 00:18:11,453
Scott: it's gotta either be so bad it's hilarious and wraps around or it's good or it's wacky.

226
00:18:11,473 --> 00:18:14,002
Scott: it's it's Zazen Jotaro action?

227
00:18:14,262 --> 00:18:15,906
Rym: maybe some Excel saga?

228
00:18:16,407 --> 00:18:16,968
Scott: who knows?

229
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:30,755
Rym: so yeah this exists and as much as I feel like everyone knows about it I it became readily apparent that a lot of people do not know that this exists or don't know why Toblerone.

230
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:31,397
Rym: so here you go.

231
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:31,939
Rym: this is it?

232
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,968
Scott: this is why Toblerone's are on your Twitter.

233
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,495
Rym: so stay tuned.

234
00:18:35,595 --> 00:18:36,640
Scott: one one last thing.

235
00:18:37,262 --> 00:18:38,488
Scott: we all know about crunchyroll.

236
00:18:38,829 --> 00:18:40,276
Scott: yeah I'll know about funnymation.

237
00:18:40,617 --> 00:18:42,065
Scott: we all know about Netflix and Hulu.

238
00:18:42,105 --> 00:18:46,548
Scott: are the places to legally watch the animes in the US online streaming and such right.

239
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:50,103
Scott: but what some people may not know about is anime strike.

240
00:18:50,766 --> 00:18:52,936
Scott: anime strike we may have talked about on the show.

241
00:18:52,956 --> 00:18:55,308
Scott: it's basically crunchyroll by Amazon.

242
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:59,667
Scott: I think you have to pay extra money even if you have Amazon Prime to get anime strike.

243
00:18:59,908 --> 00:19:01,212
Rym: oh they got a good show in here.

244
00:19:01,734 --> 00:19:07,218
Scott: but we already did you know judge anime by its cover for the new season.

245
00:19:07,278 --> 00:19:09,387
Scott: it's starting basically right now and next week.

246
00:19:09,829 --> 00:19:14,089
Scott: so we sort of know a little tiny tiny bit about each of the shows that are coming.

247
00:19:14,411 --> 00:19:20,530
Scott: so when I keep seeing news is now that are like here the shows that are streaming I'm like oh I actually know what shows are talking about for one.

248
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,225
Scott: so I guess it's going to be that way from now on if we keep making the show.

249
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:31,440
Scott: but the show that I most want to see the number one Shiki Inuyashiki which we have done an episode on the manga before on.

250
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,307
Scott: let's go look it up.

251
00:19:33,527 --> 00:19:36,538
Scott: the anime of that show is going to be on anime strike.

252
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:38,989
Rym: I already pay for crunchyroll in Netflix.

253
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,376
Rym: I am paying for anime strike.

254
00:19:40,396 --> 00:19:52,269
Scott: do not know if and if it will be streaming anywhere else other than anime strike but that is annoying because I don't pay for anime strike right now and that's the show that I want to see above all other shows.

255
00:19:52,631 --> 00:20:02,076
Rym: please stream this show on another service that I do pay for yep because it's funny though I've been watching more anime on Netflix than I have been on crunchyroll lately.

256
00:20:02,197 --> 00:20:05,629
Scott: I've currently am paying for crunchyroll and also Hulu.

257
00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:08,780
Scott: I'm only paying for Hulu because South Park.

258
00:20:09,222 --> 00:20:13,604
Scott: as soon as South Park season ends I'm gonna switch to Netflix to catch up on all these.

259
00:20:13,624 --> 00:20:14,933
Scott: I haven't been on Netflix in years.

260
00:20:14,994 --> 00:20:16,483
Scott: I'm gonna catch up on all the Netflix biz.

261
00:20:16,584 --> 00:20:20,867
Rym: yep meanwhile you're not even caught up on like adventure time which I'm just buying on Amazon.

262
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:27,876
Scott: at this point I'm waiting for adventure time to be over a hundred percent over no more adventure time ever.

263
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:34,159
Scott: and then I'm gonna either go back to episode one or where I left off which is somewhere around.

264
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,729
Rym: yeah what was going on when you left off?

265
00:20:35,789 --> 00:20:39,588
Scott: well there was that there's the series with the vampires and Marceline thing.

266
00:20:39,688 --> 00:20:41,876
Scott: you got that far and then there was the.

267
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,825
Scott: yeah there was like a miniseries.

268
00:20:44,007 --> 00:20:47,023
Scott: yeah action yes takes one and then there was some stuff after that.

269
00:20:47,806 --> 00:20:55,301
Scott: I definitely saw but I definitely didn't get to the part they talk about with like islands and water and Finn going over the ocean or whatever.

270
00:20:56,306 --> 00:20:57,230
Scott: I didn't get that far.

271
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:00,725
Scott: so it's somewhere between the stakes and the ocean part that I stopped.

272
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:07,918
Rym: there's islands there's elements and elements sets the stage for the end of the show and then there's the season.

273
00:21:07,938 --> 00:21:09,607
Rym: that's on now which is the end of the show.

274
00:21:09,748 --> 00:21:16,340
Scott: okay so what you tell me when the final episode is out and then I'll go figure out where I was or go back to the very beginning?

275
00:21:16,601 --> 00:21:19,610
Rym: yep so yeah anime strike.

276
00:21:20,131 --> 00:21:21,756
Scott: yeah this is happening one hand.

277
00:21:21,816 --> 00:21:28,260
Scott: it would be nice if as a person who is an Amazon customer right you does almost everything Amazon.

278
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:34,186
Scott: it'd be nice if say crunchyroll Netflix everyone else went away and anime strike was the place to get anime.

279
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:35,471
Rym: but do you want a monopoly?

280
00:21:35,491 --> 00:21:40,333
Scott: I mean no it's kind of nice this all this competition too but I need to be able to.

281
00:21:41,016 --> 00:21:44,755
Scott: it's annoying that to see all the anime I want to see I got to go to multiple sites.

282
00:21:44,856 --> 00:21:48,433
Scott: I know already I one site to have all the anime that I want to see.

283
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:52,070
Rym: here's how I go cuz I. there's some Showtime shows I like to watch.

284
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:56,315
Rym: there's HBO there's all these different services and they're all competing with each other.

285
00:21:56,577 --> 00:21:59,455
Rym: the new Star Trek is on its own thing which means I'm just never gonna see it.

286
00:21:59,495 --> 00:22:01,527
Scott: apparently I'm not gonna see it either because I don't give.

287
00:22:01,769 --> 00:22:10,253
Rym: so what I do now is pretty much I subscribe to a small number of those services and if something is important enough to see and it isn't on one of those I just pirate it.

288
00:22:11,017 --> 00:22:18,712
Rym: and I feel like I'm actually pirating more now than I did a few years ago because of the separation of all these streaming services.

289
00:22:18,953 --> 00:22:19,899
Scott: yeah I mean this is the.

290
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,030
Scott: you know we talked about how shitty cable TV was.

291
00:22:22,131 --> 00:22:25,007
Scott: the shittiness of cable TV you get into the internet now right?

292
00:22:25,027 --> 00:22:30,458
Scott: the shittiness of cable TV was that you paid for this package that got you all the content literally every channel.

293
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,725
Scott: but you're like fuck this.

294
00:22:31,786 --> 00:22:33,798
Scott: why am I paying for all the shit I'm not watching?

295
00:22:33,898 --> 00:22:34,120
Scott: right?

296
00:22:34,502 --> 00:22:36,954
Scott: why am I paying 40 bucks a month for all this shit?

297
00:22:36,974 --> 00:22:37,335
Scott: I'm not why.

298
00:22:37,376 --> 00:22:40,769
Scott: that's why a lot I'm just buying on Amazon right?

299
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:43,201
Scott: so now they go to streaming and it's like all right.

300
00:22:43,302 --> 00:22:46,441
Scott: well now you're paying five bucks a month to watch just what you want to watch.

301
00:22:46,904 --> 00:22:51,931
Scott: oh but actually you need to get like ten different streaming services in order to watch all the things you want to watch.

302
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:52,777
Scott: but here's where they're paying.

303
00:22:53,341 --> 00:22:54,064
Scott: and now it's cable.

304
00:22:54,105 --> 00:23:00,825
Scott: again it's like no I need the shows I want to watch with nothing else at the appropriate price.

305
00:23:01,126 --> 00:23:08,931
Rym: I know right I'm otherwise a pirate a monitor premium like I said Adventure Time Steven Universe over the garden wall.

306
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:11,323
Rym: I just bought them on Amazon not streaming.

307
00:23:11,384 --> 00:23:16,928
Rym: but you know you pay money like 30 or 40 bucks for a season and you just get the entire thing.

308
00:23:16,968 --> 00:23:18,636
Rym: you can watch it anytime forever.

309
00:23:18,737 --> 00:23:19,299
Scott: too much money.

310
00:23:19,762 --> 00:23:21,329
Scott: how many seasons of Adventure Time are there?

311
00:23:21,631 --> 00:23:22,977
Rym: fuck if I know I just buy it.

312
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:29,352
Rym: cuz if you add up the monthly fees of like a service I guess there isn't a Cartoon Network service so there isn't even an equivalent.

313
00:23:29,413 --> 00:23:34,896
Scott: there's no as far as I know no service offers streaming of every Adventure Time episode yep.

314
00:23:34,977 --> 00:23:39,639
Rym: so I've bought seasons of it and that's been cheaper than a streaming service.

315
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:40,744
Scott: I can't get it on.

316
00:23:41,106 --> 00:23:42,454
Scott: I'll pick the streaming services.

317
00:23:42,514 --> 00:23:43,482
Scott: I'll keep doing what I'm doing.

318
00:23:43,502 --> 00:23:47,831
Scott: we're just switching between them canceling one signing up for another canceling that one signing up for another.

319
00:23:47,952 --> 00:23:53,863
Scott: yep right but if there's something I want to watch and I can't like it's not on a convenient service or whatever.

320
00:23:53,884 --> 00:23:56,980
Scott: I'm just gonna be our fuck buying a thing specifically.

321
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:57,804
Scott: that's not worth it.

322
00:23:57,864 --> 00:23:58,890
Scott: it costs so much fucking money.

323
00:23:59,131 --> 00:23:59,372
Scott: yep.

324
00:23:59,795 --> 00:24:00,418
Rym: and the last news.

325
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:01,444
Rym: I'll just mention it briefly.

326
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:12,758
Rym: but if you're not going to PAX unplugged you should and you're an anime fan especially if you're listening to this night of GeekNights you should check out anime NYC because it probably is going to be the best.

327
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:15,669
Scott: we won't be going to this if we pax unplugged.

328
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:27,518
Rym: it was not coincidentally the same exact weekend yep because as much as I like anime there's a reason GeekNights Tuesday is the easiest show to do and we've done like almost 50 panels at PAX is.

329
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:33,302
Rym: but anime NYC I'm not promising it's gonna be good but it has the best chance.

330
00:24:33,382 --> 00:24:37,159
Scott: it's good enough that I would go to it and we stopped going.

331
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:50,199
Rym: I promise that it's good enough that I would go to it knowing what I know now and we have cut literally every anime con out of our schedule at this point mm-hmm and if we re-add one as long as it doesn't continue to overlap with PAX Unplugged.

332
00:24:50,219 --> 00:24:51,002
Rym: I'm mr.

333
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:52,208
Rym: going to end my NYC.

334
00:24:52,268 --> 00:24:55,902
Scott: well we can find out now how the first one went when we decide about next year.

335
00:24:56,062 --> 00:24:59,998
Scott: yeah some other news is oh you got more news.

336
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:00,862
Scott: I know some.

337
00:25:01,043 --> 00:25:02,289
Scott: oh so oh this is a news.

338
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:02,893
Scott: anime NYC.

339
00:25:02,913 --> 00:25:05,852
Scott: I was thinking cuz you started talking about convention I was starting to think about a moment.

340
00:25:05,912 --> 00:25:08,257
Rym: yeah but I think that means it's time for.

341
00:25:14,249 --> 00:25:17,098
Rym: but anyway things of the day.

342
00:25:17,158 --> 00:25:17,640
Rym: what do you got?

343
00:25:18,001 --> 00:25:24,484
Scott: so this is a video from before I was born in 1979 and it shows some place in Iowa.

344
00:25:24,504 --> 00:25:24,826
Scott: this is only.

345
00:25:24,886 --> 00:25:41,634
Scott: this is on the Iowa Public Television YouTube channel where it is loaded with a wide variety of things a very wide and this is a video of in Iowa in 1979 in color a rolling pin throwing competition.

346
00:25:41,654 --> 00:25:43,380
Scott: that's all you got to know.

347
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:50,368
Rym: and but this is pretty amazing already mm-hmm oh my god look at all that old camera equipment.

348
00:25:50,388 --> 00:25:51,874
Rym: look at that camcorder mm-hmm.

349
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:53,119
Rym: oh my god I mean.

350
00:25:53,139 --> 00:25:57,855
Scott: look at the quality of video for 1979 at a rolling pin throwing competition.

351
00:25:57,875 --> 00:26:03,854
Rym: hey yeah that is definitely 1979. look at look at that shirt.

352
00:26:03,894 --> 00:26:05,804
Rym: look at that guy with them overalls.

353
00:26:05,945 --> 00:26:06,488
Rym: look at the way.

354
00:26:06,548 --> 00:26:07,934
Rym: oh my god look at that microphone mm-hmm.

355
00:26:08,897 --> 00:26:10,222
Scott: this is magic yep.

356
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:11,888
Rym: so my thing of the day.

357
00:26:11,908 --> 00:26:17,710
Rym: a while way back I had a thing of the day that was basically this guy who takes like.

358
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:31,568
Rym: he's a really good musician and he takes classical music and mashes it up with other classical music on the piano in a very technically proficient manner and this individual has now done something very nerdy that you all will enjoy.

359
00:26:31,588 --> 00:26:42,971
Rym: so if you listen to those mashups that I linked you before as things the day a long time ago and didn't enjoy them because you're a Philistine who doesn't understand classical music it didn't recognize the cleverness of what was going on.

360
00:26:43,372 --> 00:26:56,270
Rym: here's that exact same thing with Nintendo music Pokemon Megaman 2 a bunch of different legends and Zell does in there yep and it starts out good.

361
00:26:56,872 --> 00:27:08,701
Rym: but listen watch and listen to this all the way to the end because it charges its laser and it definitely saves the best for last and it kicks it into high gear right around when Megaman 2 comes in.

362
00:27:08,842 --> 00:27:12,999
Rym: oh yeah Megaman 2 and Star Fox combined and it only goes up from there.

363
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:13,783
Scott: all right.

364
00:27:13,823 --> 00:27:16,032
Scott: so some meta things that are going on.

365
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:19,966
Scott: so this weekend is I guess evil Columbus Day weekend.

366
00:27:20,007 --> 00:27:21,694
Scott: fuck Columbus fuck him in the ass.

367
00:27:21,735 --> 00:27:24,531
Scott: yep I don't celebrate that shit but we don't have to go to work.

368
00:27:24,551 --> 00:27:26,097
Scott: so we're probably we're all doing stuff.

369
00:27:27,362 --> 00:27:29,852
Rym: anyway there's gonna be no Tuesday show.

370
00:27:29,932 --> 00:27:31,741
Rym: cuz I realized that's when the hockey game is.

371
00:27:32,103 --> 00:27:39,080
Scott: yes I was about to say that tonight is puck night.

372
00:27:39,561 --> 00:27:41,364
Scott: that is October 4th.

373
00:27:42,186 --> 00:27:50,294
Scott: NHL regular season begins and for the Rangers it begins tomorrow but we're going to a hockey game next Tuesday so there won't be a show.

374
00:27:50,575 --> 00:27:57,098
Scott: yep next weekend after that we are doing a thing at our friend Matt's house.

375
00:27:57,641 --> 00:28:00,292
Scott: we're called temporarily calling review con or whatever.

376
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:05,879
Rym: yeah this is not so before any of you just man GeekNights you know how we talk about how we're starting a convention.

377
00:28:06,241 --> 00:28:08,775
Rym: this is not that this is a separate event.

378
00:28:09,136 --> 00:28:10,582
Scott: that yeah it's not a convention.

379
00:28:10,964 --> 00:28:13,316
Rym: it may turn into one someday years and years.

380
00:28:13,336 --> 00:28:21,914
Scott: basically what we're gonna do is just gonna go to his house and play board games all fucking day pros only serious business right and play a ton of games.

381
00:28:21,955 --> 00:28:39,218
Scott: that will have a huge stock of tabletop games to review and we're gonna stream so you could tune into that on from mostly prop maybe the night of Friday the 13th in October but also Saturday the 14th is where most of the action is gonna be okay.

382
00:28:39,238 --> 00:28:39,741
Rym: you miss that.

383
00:28:39,781 --> 00:28:47,311
Rym: don't worry because the output of that convention that event will be a shit ton of game reviews like really high quality.

384
00:28:47,372 --> 00:28:56,938
Scott: also right November 4th and 5th in New York is gamer X East - yeah right we went to gamer X East one.

385
00:28:57,078 --> 00:28:58,945
Scott: this is gamer X East - it's coming.

386
00:28:59,848 --> 00:29:08,318
Scott: that same weekend is also the netrunner World Championships Oh and also the New York City Marathon if you care okay.

387
00:29:08,699 --> 00:29:19,168
Scott: and then of course two weeks after that right November 16 17 18 19. well you know that weekend whatever dates are in there.

388
00:29:19,188 --> 00:29:24,180
Scott: yep the week before Thanksgiving is PAX.

389
00:29:24,942 --> 00:29:25,704
Scott: unplug it.

390
00:29:25,724 --> 00:29:28,190
Rym: the inaugural PAX unplug.

391
00:29:28,411 --> 00:29:32,123
Scott: remember Pennsylvania fill a piece of shit Delphi.

392
00:29:32,143 --> 00:29:42,322
Rym: this is a tabletop convention but it has all the accoutrements of a full packs just all focused exclusively on tabletop.

393
00:29:42,362 --> 00:29:42,804
Scott: that's right.

394
00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:50,885
Scott: there won't be no Nintendo booth there unless they're bringing some Mario Party and even then it had to be Mario Party the card game or something and it's not sold out.

395
00:29:50,925 --> 00:29:57,369
Rym: yet you can get badges and I'm telling you right now PAX Unplugged it will fucking explode.

396
00:29:57,449 --> 00:29:58,313
Scott: it will sell out.

397
00:29:58,594 --> 00:29:59,318
Rym: it is going to.

398
00:29:59,378 --> 00:30:02,293
Rym: this one's gonna be a little smaller partly because it's the first one.

399
00:30:02,696 --> 00:30:05,270
Rym: but remember the first PAX East and what PAX East turned into.

400
00:30:05,651 --> 00:30:07,699
Scott: even the first PAX was hella small.

401
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:09,647
Scott: the Necro Lava Con was even smaller.

402
00:30:09,968 --> 00:30:14,664
Rym: but PAX East the first one was already exploding and then it double exploded.

403
00:30:15,186 --> 00:30:19,119
Rym: so unplugged is gonna be way big.

404
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:25,022
Scott: and this is the first one since there's no other major competition for tabletop cons in the Northeast.

405
00:30:25,504 --> 00:30:25,785
Scott: right.

406
00:30:25,986 --> 00:30:27,895
Scott: you know the Gen cons and the origins.

407
00:30:27,936 --> 00:30:31,635
Rym: those places are like the Midwest and they're a different kind of tabletop con.

408
00:30:31,655 --> 00:30:32,378
Rym: they're not the packs.

409
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,268
Scott: there is no tabletop con like.

410
00:30:34,328 --> 00:30:36,197
Scott: this is the only one in the Northeast.

411
00:30:36,397 --> 00:30:43,572
Scott: in this major population center is gonna be big and they should have an unplugged West because they don't have anything like this either.

412
00:30:43,613 --> 00:30:46,085
Scott: as far as I know I'm already pushing hard ones.

413
00:30:46,366 --> 00:30:52,936
Rym: I'm already because you know there's PAX dev which is before PAX West in Seattle which is the two-day game industry.

414
00:30:53,056 --> 00:30:56,528
Rym: only black box no everyone signs NDA's you know.

415
00:30:56,829 --> 00:30:59,282
Rym: talk about stuff openly because no one's gonna spill the beans.

416
00:30:59,906 --> 00:31:05,787
Rym: I feel like we need a tabletop like dev unplugged before this one down the road.

417
00:31:05,827 --> 00:31:15,847
Rym: I'm gonna push hard for that because I feel like the tabletop industry is kind of like how yeah you get like high fashion that turns into regular Walmart fashion.

418
00:31:15,867 --> 00:31:22,309
Rym: I feel like the or comics and cartoons drive live-action remakes and stuff.

419
00:31:22,329 --> 00:31:33,166
Rym: I feel like tabletop is where a lot of the real core cutting-edge game design and development happens and then that spills into video games.

420
00:31:33,568 --> 00:31:35,015
Scott: so that's the GeekNights calendar.

421
00:31:35,035 --> 00:31:36,985
Scott: remember to go to all the places on the.

422
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:44,252
Scott: if you really care about GeekNights so much that you're either watching the stupid stream on YouTube right now we're gonna be a gamer acts even if they don't accept our panels.

423
00:31:44,312 --> 00:31:45,980
Scott: sure we're gonna be right there.

424
00:31:46,161 --> 00:31:46,603
Rym: we're gonna be.

425
00:31:46,643 --> 00:31:48,633
Scott: in fact at least one day we'll go to it.

426
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:50,584
Rym: we're gonna be at PAX unplugged because this is like.

427
00:31:51,228 --> 00:31:53,960
Rym: this is the convention that was made for us anyway.

428
00:31:55,486 --> 00:32:11,810
Scott: but yeah like I was saying if you're not if you're if you're sad enough that you're watching GeekNights live on YouTube which you can do or listening to it as a podcast like wow you should go to all the places on the internet that GeekNights is like our forum at community dot front row crew dot com our website at front row crew.

429
00:32:12,051 --> 00:32:12,432
Scott: calm.

430
00:32:13,135 --> 00:32:19,419
Scott: both of our YouTube channels Twitter's Facebook's Instagram's every kind of social place that there is.

431
00:32:19,941 --> 00:32:23,977
Scott: we have things and those are all better than the actual product of GeekNights.

432
00:32:24,158 --> 00:32:28,359
Rym: there is a lot of biz on our YouTube channel and we're going to be posting.

433
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,985
Scott: you know I'm basically I'm putting in a lot of effort to post to all the things more frequently.

434
00:32:34,005 --> 00:32:36,636
Rym: oh look GeekNights is live right now on YouTube.

435
00:32:36,917 --> 00:32:37,882
Scott: yeah that's don't watch.

436
00:32:37,902 --> 00:32:40,595
Scott: that definitely have something better to do.

437
00:32:40,715 --> 00:32:43,389
Scott: but if you're really so sad that you don't there it is.

438
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:47,209
Rym: there are ten people watching right now and there's a lit chat where they're.

439
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,394
Rym: they're talking.

440
00:32:48,796 --> 00:32:50,543
Scott: surely they must have something better to do.

441
00:32:51,085 --> 00:32:55,622
Rym: so yeah in keeping with our spooky theme we're gonna review Scooby-doo.

442
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:58,773
Scott: so I already learned some things.

443
00:32:58,834 --> 00:33:02,533
Rym: because I'm not an expert on Scooby-doo by any means do not thought.

444
00:33:02,934 --> 00:33:07,115
Rym: if I sound like I know a lot about Scooby-doo it's cuz you read it on Wikipedia today.

445
00:33:07,336 --> 00:33:11,517
Rym: it's not only that it's because I'm looking at the Wikipedia article while I talk to you.

446
00:33:11,778 --> 00:33:20,526
Rym: so when I say something in the next 20 minutes or 30 minutes like ah so when ABC took over from CVS in that today.

447
00:33:20,546 --> 00:33:21,007
Scott: yeah.

448
00:33:21,248 --> 00:33:22,231
Scott: however I knew.

449
00:33:22,593 --> 00:33:34,104
Scott: the only thing I know about Scooby-doo is what I've seen which is a really old Scooby-doo that looks like old Hanna-Barbera cartoons and a pup named Scooby-doo that I saw on Saturday mornings as a kid and that's it.

450
00:33:34,124 --> 00:33:45,597
Scott: so what I know that there are like more recent Scooby movies that are live-action and supposedly a very recent cartoon and there's also some comic books that I've heard that are good and stuff.

451
00:33:45,617 --> 00:33:47,668
Scott: but I haven't seen any of that stuff.

452
00:33:47,728 --> 00:33:49,816
Scott: I've only supposedly be old.

453
00:33:49,836 --> 00:33:52,645
Rym: Scooby-doo is good but we'll see.

454
00:33:52,665 --> 00:33:56,786
Scott: I don't know and I don't plan to watch it cuz even if it's good I got better things to be doing.

455
00:33:56,866 --> 00:34:00,645
Rym: also I'm gonna admit something very openly I never liked Scooby-doo even as a kid.

456
00:34:01,188 --> 00:34:02,173
Rym: Scooby-doo is one of those.

457
00:34:02,233 --> 00:34:02,956
Rym: I watched it.

458
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:07,095
Rym: I watched a shit ton of it but I didn't particularly like it.

459
00:34:07,598 --> 00:34:09,467
Scott: Scooby-doo is one of those things right.

460
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,793
Scott: it's even weird right cuz?

461
00:34:11,255 --> 00:34:15,417
Scott: you know you think about something like beat ass right like Batman the animated series.

462
00:34:15,638 --> 00:34:17,847
Scott: if that was on I fucking watched it.

463
00:34:17,927 --> 00:34:20,799
Rym: even if I'd seen the episode I was seen it.

464
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,547
Scott: I fucking watched that shit right.

465
00:34:22,868 --> 00:34:27,525
Scott: but if you had come to me and been like you know yo like what's like I would never.

466
00:34:27,947 --> 00:34:32,705
Scott: I'd never considered myself like a fan of it or a Batman fan or whatever.

467
00:34:33,167 --> 00:34:35,356
Scott: but if it was on I watched it like oh my god.

468
00:34:35,397 --> 00:34:40,964
Scott: and Scooby-doo while clearly nowhere near as good as beat ass was much the same way.

469
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,518
Scott: like I never would have considered myself a fan of Scooby-doo.

470
00:34:43,579 --> 00:34:46,315
Scott: I never would have listed it as something I liked or was it or you know?

471
00:34:46,696 --> 00:34:48,686
Scott: anywhere like that wouldn't even come to mind.

472
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:54,452
Scott: but if it was on and nothing else was on I watched it and this is part of why I'm don't watch TV.

473
00:34:54,693 --> 00:35:06,859
Rym: so I think part of what's interesting to me about Scooby-doo is that when we were kids we sort of grew up as the last TV generation because the internet came just as we were moving into high school in college.

474
00:35:07,461 --> 00:35:12,601
Rym: YouTube came after college oh yeah but we stopped watching TV.

475
00:35:12,621 --> 00:35:18,527
Scott: there might have been two or four YouTube definitely two or three generations after us that watch TV.

476
00:35:18,607 --> 00:35:23,233
Scott: cuz like my younger brother I was gonna get something for you younger and sister is eight years younger.

477
00:35:23,253 --> 00:35:24,097
Scott: they watch TV.

478
00:35:24,479 --> 00:35:26,429
Rym: we grew up doing a generation after.

479
00:35:26,469 --> 00:35:26,831
Scott: that doesn't?

480
00:35:26,851 --> 00:35:35,869
Rym: where Saturday morning cartoons were still a thing mostly true they were a big thing during when we'd like specifically we were childhood.

481
00:35:35,889 --> 00:35:46,774
Rym: we definitely decreased in bigness as my life went on and as a result I would just turn on the TV and watch whatever was on like whatever the best thing was on at that time.

482
00:35:46,835 --> 00:35:55,066
Rym: I would watch it meaning I would often end up on the channel that cartoons and Scooby-doo would be on mm-hmm and I would just watch it.

483
00:35:55,467 --> 00:36:04,598
Rym: yep and as a result I've seen a lot of Scooby-doo and I had this vague idea that Scooby-doo had gone on forever.

484
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:13,777
Scott: and because I only ever saw because at the time that I was watching TV there was already in crazy reruns well right there was no internet or anything.

485
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:19,268
Scott: I couldn't get information easily about like the history of Scooby-doo and what channels that had been on or anything.

486
00:36:19,308 --> 00:36:22,470
Scott: that's now just all listed right there in Wikipedia for you to figure out in two seconds.

487
00:36:22,611 --> 00:36:27,149
Scott: yeah so all I knew is like huh there seems to be this one Scooby series.

488
00:36:27,169 --> 00:36:28,235
Scott: that's just Scooby-doo.

489
00:36:28,617 --> 00:36:29,019
Scott: that seemed.

490
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:30,668
Scott: that seems like it's the original one.

491
00:36:30,728 --> 00:36:31,775
Scott: right that makes sense yeah.

492
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:35,618
Scott: and this is all the one called Scooby movies that has celebrity guests I guess down knots.

493
00:36:35,799 --> 00:36:37,327
Scott: I guess that one came later.

494
00:36:37,347 --> 00:36:44,283
Rym: that one was only dated for me because I knew who the celebrities were but I can tell by looking at it this still looks old so it must be old.

495
00:36:44,303 --> 00:36:52,414
Scott: yeah then this pup named Scooby-doo which is on Saturday morning and that one looks way newer and is clearly brand new and is clearly garbage.

496
00:36:52,674 --> 00:37:05,261
Scott: well anyway but you know it's like I could just sort of tell but I didn't know anything and there might have been other ones that like if they weren't being broadcast on TV I didn't know about.

497
00:37:05,281 --> 00:37:06,266
Rym: this is what's crazy.

498
00:37:06,326 --> 00:37:08,577
Rym: as a kid I was kind of obsessed with.

499
00:37:08,617 --> 00:37:26,591
Rym: I see these shows like he-man and Scooby-doo and because I sort of started them in meteor as because I didn't know there was never like an origin story or like a continuous plot I'd see an episode I'd see another episode I'd see another episode and I'd wonder like what's their deal?

500
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:33,570
Rym: I also wondered that every now and then you'd see an episode that was older than anything you've seen before and he'd be like whoa.

501
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:35,420
Rym: now I'm gonna learn some stuff and you never did.

502
00:37:35,621 --> 00:37:48,703
Scott: no you know the only show as a kid that I met there are only two shows in my youth like mega youth right like elementary and middle school youth that I managed to watch every episode in order and those show well to a certain point at least.

503
00:37:48,764 --> 00:37:50,412
Scott: I stopped watching it after eventually.

504
00:37:50,492 --> 00:37:54,311
Scott: but for years I watched every episode of Fox x-men in order.

505
00:37:54,532 --> 00:38:02,948
Scott: yeah I did that from when it aired with launch actually pissed me off because they fuck up the continuity like it doesn't really dark Phoenix.

506
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:10,819
Scott: and well yeah and I don't know if anyone remembers this there was a live-action Superman show called Lewis and Clark.

507
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:13,710
Rym: oh yeah Lois and Clark I didn't like that show.

508
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:23,230
Scott: that was on ABC and I watched every single episode of that in order as they were aired every single new one until I guess like there was some.

509
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,220
Scott: really it basically jumped a shark at some point.

510
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:31,503
Rym: it's not watching mask which was my favorite media on earth when I was a child.

511
00:38:32,167 --> 00:38:33,880
Rym: I didn't actually see it all in order.

512
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:35,267
Scott: Thundercats I couldn't they?

513
00:38:35,287 --> 00:38:37,296
Scott: just it wasn't broadcast properly.

514
00:38:37,337 --> 00:38:40,189
Rym: Voltron Thundercats did have an origin episode.

515
00:38:40,409 --> 00:38:42,879
Scott: oh yeah I never saw until adulthood.

516
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,830
Scott: I saw it as a child but I was not.

517
00:38:44,871 --> 00:38:46,158
Scott: but there were many things I missed.

518
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:51,008
Scott: like Thundercats it was like suddenly they were on another planet and I didn't see the episodes of how they got there.

519
00:38:51,229 --> 00:38:52,395
Scott: no because they weren't aired.

520
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:57,279
Scott: or a volt you know what Scooby-doo was like that like it felt like something transformers.

521
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:02,586
Rym: ha like it felt like something from an ancient time and I really wondered like what's the deal?

522
00:39:02,626 --> 00:39:03,129
Rym: and not enough.

523
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:06,144
Rym: but I learned something terrifying about Scott right before we heard the show.

524
00:39:06,164 --> 00:39:11,422
Rym: he did not really understand the true terror of scrappy.

525
00:39:11,463 --> 00:39:18,572
Scott: do no see I had only ever my memory which is admittedly not the greatest at least not remembering this sort of thing.

526
00:39:19,235 --> 00:39:29,946
Rym: didn't only remembered scrappy do as a character in pup named Scooby-doo because ridiculous there is more Scooby-doo like a regular Scooby-doo with scrappy in it then without but there was.

527
00:39:29,966 --> 00:39:43,619
Scott: there was definitely sort of this thing where the redone versions of shows you know a different animation that happened in the 90s had additional characters that were not in the original versions right.

528
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:50,210
Scott: so it sort of made sense in my brain that scrappy do is one of those like oh they concocted this extra character for the.

529
00:39:50,431 --> 00:39:53,967
Rym: yeah that is literally what Pucci was making fun of in The Simpsons.

530
00:39:54,088 --> 00:39:54,731
Scott: exactly.

531
00:39:54,751 --> 00:39:59,069
Rym: they added scrappy do and this is even on the Wikipedia but I knew this already.

532
00:39:59,511 --> 00:40:06,906
Rym: they added scrappy because Scooby-doo was dropping in popularity and scrappy was like this character designed to get kids interested again mm-hmm.

533
00:40:07,709 --> 00:40:12,871
Scott: but anyway yeah I had not recalled scratch seeing scrappy do in old Scooby-doo cartoons.

534
00:40:13,072 --> 00:40:15,663
Scott: yeah but apparently I'm wrong because there it is.

535
00:40:15,703 --> 00:40:19,821
Scott: scrappy do was added in the 70s before I was scrappied is older than me.

536
00:40:20,122 --> 00:40:24,924
Rym: yep all right Scott didn't believe me until I showed him a screenshot of scrappy do?

537
00:40:24,945 --> 00:40:26,313
Scott: it's not that I didn't believe you?

538
00:40:26,394 --> 00:40:30,313
Scott: is that I was just like shocked that it was that you know that my memory was so.

539
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:32,625
Rym: so the ways the way it actually broke down.

540
00:40:32,665 --> 00:40:34,296
Rym: now I'm looking at Wikipedia because I didn't know this.

541
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:39,358
Rym: the classic Scooby-doo meaning the actual original one is Scooby-doo.

542
00:40:39,398 --> 00:40:40,543
Rym: where are you with that theme?

543
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:42,553
Scott: Scooby-doo be do yes that one.

544
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:43,659
Scott: I have seen that one.

545
00:40:43,699 --> 00:40:45,808
Scott: how many episodes are there?

546
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,977
Scott: uh 41 I definitely haven't seen all of them.

547
00:40:48,258 --> 00:40:51,712
Rym: and then I think I've seen them all and then there's not that many.

548
00:40:52,456 --> 00:40:55,590
Rym: and then there's the Scooby-doo movies which I have seen.

549
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:56,735
Scott: many of them see.

550
00:40:56,755 --> 00:40:57,358
Rym: what's crazy.

551
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,636
Rym: they're called the new Scooby-doo movies and they're from the early 70s.

552
00:41:01,717 --> 00:41:03,465
Scott: those all have guests on them.

553
00:41:03,546 --> 00:41:06,943
Rym: I'm not the ones I remember the most only remember the one with Don Knots.

554
00:41:07,104 --> 00:41:08,069
Scott: I remember the one.

555
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,578
Scott: I do remember the Don Knots one.

556
00:41:09,658 --> 00:41:15,710
Scott: I also remember the Batman and Robin one which is Adam West and Burt Ward doing the voice acting if I'm not mistaken.

557
00:41:15,911 --> 00:41:17,177
Rym: Oh John Astin was in one.

558
00:41:17,197 --> 00:41:19,589
Rym: I don't know who that is Gomez from the Addams Family.

559
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,800
Scott: oh I there was an Addams Family one I did.

560
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,514
Rym: yeah I don't think I've seen that one but I remember at.

561
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:28,632
Rym: oh I remember the Dick Van Dyke one I do and the Casey Kasem.

562
00:41:28,692 --> 00:41:29,556
Rym: right he played Robin.

563
00:41:29,596 --> 00:41:31,945
Rym: yeah oh shit it's all coming back.

564
00:41:31,965 --> 00:41:33,490
Scott: I do remember.

565
00:41:33,611 --> 00:41:37,225
Scott: clearly there were at least two of these with the Harlem Globetrotters.

566
00:41:37,306 --> 00:41:38,732
Rym: yep the three Stooges.

567
00:41:38,873 --> 00:41:39,998
Rym: one I remember eating.

568
00:41:40,018 --> 00:41:41,064
Scott: there was a three Stooges.

569
00:41:41,145 --> 00:41:43,198
Scott: I don't think it was the actual three Stooges voice act.

570
00:41:43,238 --> 00:41:43,620
Scott: well as it.

571
00:41:43,661 --> 00:41:44,905
Rym: which three Stooges?

572
00:41:45,387 --> 00:41:46,150
Scott: the original one?

573
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,093
Rym: well which ones?

574
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,743
Scott: the Harry Moe and curly curly.

575
00:41:49,863 --> 00:41:50,526
Rym: what about champ?

576
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:52,955
Scott: that's the fourth Stu is it?

577
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:54,180
Rym: yeah who's the fifth Stu?

578
00:41:54,582 --> 00:41:57,174
Scott: there wasn't a fist but you don't get you daughter.

579
00:41:57,375 --> 00:42:00,406
Rym: what about the ones where they had all these other people play?

580
00:42:00,426 --> 00:42:02,052
Rym: a third Stu?

581
00:42:03,075 --> 00:42:07,490
Scott: I'm not that I don't know that we used to listen to pen radio.

582
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:09,500
Rym: he fucking never shut up about that shit.

583
00:42:10,183 --> 00:42:12,033
Rym: in like every episode he'd be like helmet.

584
00:42:12,053 --> 00:42:16,334
Rym: there's 19 Stooges however many there were and he would go into like crazy detail.

585
00:42:16,394 --> 00:42:18,423
Scott: not someone who knows a lot about three Stu.

586
00:42:18,464 --> 00:42:19,568
Scott: you used to be like.

587
00:42:19,588 --> 00:42:20,894
Rym: we used to talk about this.

588
00:42:21,155 --> 00:42:22,320
Scott: no how do you?

589
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:22,822
Scott: not I've.

590
00:42:22,863 --> 00:42:27,584
Scott: you know in my life I've probably ever seen like the most basic of three Stooges content.

591
00:42:27,925 --> 00:42:28,968
Rym: there is two just cartoons.

592
00:42:29,771 --> 00:42:37,486
Rym: no okay yes so Scooby Doo meets the Harlem Globetrotters is two episodes the mystery of the Haunted Island and the Loch Ness.

593
00:42:37,507 --> 00:42:38,231
Scott: see how come?

594
00:42:38,271 --> 00:42:40,541
Scott: I can remember that shit but I can't remember.

595
00:42:42,305 --> 00:42:44,169
Rym: Phyllis Diller played herself.

596
00:42:46,112 --> 00:42:47,455
Rym: okay die Casey Elliott.

597
00:42:47,535 --> 00:42:50,924
Rym: okay I'm I don't remember some of these.

598
00:42:51,266 --> 00:42:52,772
Rym: and some of these I really remember.

599
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:55,083
Rym: but anyway back to Scooby Doo.

600
00:42:55,826 --> 00:43:02,350
Rym: so the other thing that I remember that really bothered me as a is that there was a line between.

601
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:08,308
Rym: there was like the original episodes all had literally the exact same plot.

602
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:18,528
Scott: yes to the point that is the main thing I wanted to discuss today is that there are many works of art in the history of the world that are episodic and formulaic.

603
00:43:18,749 --> 00:43:19,472
Scott: right there.

604
00:43:19,492 --> 00:43:20,817
Scott: there are many such things.

605
00:43:20,857 --> 00:43:27,914
Scott: yep exactly of all of them that have ever existed.

606
00:43:27,934 --> 00:43:34,434
Scott: I believe personally that Scooby Doo is the most rigidly formula.

607
00:43:34,615 --> 00:43:35,638
Rym: so what's the formula of?

608
00:43:35,658 --> 00:43:37,966
Scott: and the formula is this right?

609
00:43:37,986 --> 00:43:42,664
Scott: the Scooby Doo gang rolls into a new town in the mystery mobile.

610
00:43:42,765 --> 00:43:44,495
Scott: in the mystery a stranger comes to town.

611
00:43:44,837 --> 00:43:52,287
Scott: of course they're not strangers even though it's a mystery mobile right and they encounter some sort of local troubles.

612
00:43:52,668 --> 00:43:55,880
Scott: they notice it right and somehow get involved in it.

613
00:43:56,582 --> 00:43:59,191
Scott: somehow right it turns out.

614
00:43:59,231 --> 00:44:01,157
Rym: well then they try to catch.

615
00:44:01,217 --> 00:44:02,583
Rym: it's a monster or something.

616
00:44:02,603 --> 00:44:12,784
Scott: somebody trying to catch it one somebody involved in the local troubles decides to dress up as a monster as a way to win out in their local feud.

617
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,553
Rym: oh wait I was gonna way more specific.

618
00:44:14,593 --> 00:44:18,029
Scott: that's creating some sort of legend in the town of the creepy.

619
00:44:18,049 --> 00:44:31,556
Scott: whatever it is the mystery gang attempts to chase this monster all about no and find clues or whatever but they'll first basically they'll split up to chase the thing.

620
00:44:31,616 --> 00:44:37,219
Rym: yes so Scooby and Shaggy will get scared by it while Fred is actually doing an investigation.

621
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:42,922
Scott: then they have the time then they do the joke with all the doors yep the same joke every time.

622
00:44:44,186 --> 00:44:51,093
Scott: then they're all together again and then somehow they find the person catch them by accident and remove their mask.

623
00:44:51,113 --> 00:44:55,719
Scott: yeah it's the person you obviously thought it was if you're intelligent and not a small child.

624
00:44:55,779 --> 00:44:59,782
Scott: but since this is a show for small children hopefully they would be amazed at the mystery.

625
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:02,296
Rym: I feel like it was always the second person they introduced.

626
00:45:02,799 --> 00:45:05,834
Scott: it's there's like a person who's like the obviously bad person.

627
00:45:05,854 --> 00:45:10,133
Scott: and then there's the second person who's sort of less notice.

628
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:10,756
Scott: that's always them.

629
00:45:10,877 --> 00:45:18,966
Rym: yep every time every time I went away with it ever for you fucking kids I don't think they said fucking.

630
00:45:18,986 --> 00:45:23,557
Rym: but so there was a point in the show where it shifted from.

631
00:45:23,577 --> 00:45:29,383
Rym: it is a person in a costume or with a projector which as a kid I never figured out how that worked.

632
00:45:30,006 --> 00:45:31,273
Rym: projectors don't work that way.

633
00:45:31,293 --> 00:45:40,871
Scott: I know there's a lot of explanations of technology in the show that make no sense but it was always just a projector also makes no sense how these costumes that people were wearing were believable enough that they got scared by them.

634
00:45:40,912 --> 00:45:49,983
Rym: well because when they animated it they'd animate the monster as a real fucking monster glowing and flying and then when they take the costume off they animate it looking really shitty and poorly made.

635
00:45:50,043 --> 00:45:54,326
Scott: yet most of the time when I bring up Scooby-Doo it's to talk about the Scooby-Doo effect.

636
00:45:54,366 --> 00:45:59,892
Scott: see it was so poorly and cheaply animated that they would put almost everything in the background.

637
00:45:59,912 --> 00:46:02,606
Scott: because you draw a background once and it's cheap.

638
00:46:02,948 --> 00:46:06,505
Scott: if you got to draw on the cell that means you got to draw again when it moves.

639
00:46:06,827 --> 00:46:13,664
Scott: yeah so you can see something they would do a lot is if there was an object that they were going to interact with in the scene that was going to become.

640
00:46:13,744 --> 00:46:16,943
Rym: it would look really shitty and just be there like one door different.

641
00:46:17,505 --> 00:46:22,751
Scott: only that object would be animated drawn on the cell and the rest of everything will be on the background.

642
00:46:22,791 --> 00:46:34,414
Scott: so you could look at a scene and Scooby-Doo and you see the characters would clearly be animated on a cell with cell paint and then the door that someone was gonna open would be animated with cell paint and everything else is clearly background.

643
00:46:34,435 --> 00:46:38,535
Scott: and so you at the start of a scene things that could be interacted.

644
00:46:38,575 --> 00:46:39,560
Rym: well there's a trapdoor.

645
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:40,929
Rym: they're about to step on right.

646
00:46:40,949 --> 00:46:41,634
Scott: there's a trapdoor.

647
00:46:41,654 --> 00:46:42,540
Scott: they're about to step on.

648
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:42,902
Scott: there's the.

649
00:46:42,982 --> 00:46:44,592
Scott: well someone's gonna fall down.

650
00:46:44,652 --> 00:46:46,261
Scott: there's a thing that's gonna move right.

651
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:53,034
Scott: you could tell the beginning of the scene that that object was going to become animated very soon and that's like it was.

652
00:46:53,134 --> 00:46:53,858
Scott: you know Scooby-Doo.

653
00:46:53,918 --> 00:47:05,710
Scott: if I and I see this often and refer to it often in video games when you're going around a video game area particularly in a 3d game and it's like oh there's an object I can interact with it's Scooby dude.

654
00:47:06,092 --> 00:47:07,599
Scott: you know it has the Scooby-Doo effect.

655
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:13,609
Scott: it stands out in some way from all the useless background items the chase sequences we were talking about.

656
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:15,602
Rym: they didn't start doing that till the second season.

657
00:47:15,782 --> 00:47:21,124
Scott: really it feels like there was one in every single episode seven of the second season episodes.

658
00:47:21,184 --> 00:47:23,433
Scott: that's now really okay.

659
00:47:23,594 --> 00:47:25,742
Rym: they got some famous bubblegum pop people.

660
00:47:25,923 --> 00:47:28,776
Rym: I guess I don't know who these people are but there's.

661
00:47:28,816 --> 00:47:30,425
Rym: there's all this stuff about the music.

662
00:47:30,465 --> 00:47:31,069
Rym: I'm just gonna ignore.

663
00:47:31,089 --> 00:47:34,525
Scott: no all the music the original songs.

664
00:47:35,889 --> 00:47:38,537
Scott: that's a memorable kind of okay good song.

665
00:47:38,618 --> 00:47:39,681
Scott: I don't remember any other songs.

666
00:47:41,187 --> 00:47:49,221
Rym: I remember a bunch of them because I was looking through the names of the different series and I specifically remembered a bunch of these but not all of them.

667
00:47:49,663 --> 00:47:51,271
Rym: so like oh those are video games.

668
00:47:51,291 --> 00:47:53,482
Rym: let me get up to the actual television shows.

669
00:47:53,502 --> 00:47:53,904
Rym: here we go.

670
00:47:54,346 --> 00:47:56,697
Rym: so the original show was titled Scooby-Doo comma.

671
00:47:56,738 --> 00:47:58,347
Scott: where are you talked about this already?

672
00:47:58,569 --> 00:47:59,434
Rym: exclamation point.

673
00:47:59,474 --> 00:48:05,338
Rym: no question mark mm-hmm which bothers me now okay so then it was just the Scooby-Doo show for like.

674
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,967
Scott: just edit Wikipedia.

675
00:48:06,987 --> 00:48:07,812
Scott: put the question mark in.

676
00:48:08,033 --> 00:48:08,435
Rym: that's good.

677
00:48:08,475 --> 00:48:09,842
Rym: no that'd be a lie is it?

678
00:48:10,404 --> 00:48:16,525
Rym: and then right after that Scott the show is officially called Scooby-Doo and scrappy doo.

679
00:48:16,545 --> 00:48:24,146
Rym: and then there was all another 99 shorts that were further Scooby-Doo and scrappy doo.

680
00:48:24,748 --> 00:48:31,214
Rym: and then in the 80s the next season was called the new Scooby-Doo and scrappy doo show mm-hmm.

681
00:48:31,555 --> 00:48:33,584
Rym: a pup named Scooby-Doo didn't come until the late 80s.

682
00:48:33,784 --> 00:48:36,294
Scott: yeah no that's good Scooby-Doo scrap.

683
00:48:36,796 --> 00:48:41,195
Scott: a pup named Scooby-Doo late 80s is the only one that was new in my child.

684
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:44,706
Rym: in fact it looks like they're so when I was conscious was continuous.

685
00:48:44,766 --> 00:48:51,902
Scott: I remember it between 1969 69 in 1984 six really that's got.

686
00:48:51,922 --> 00:48:53,827
Rym: the original show was 69 to 78. whoa all right.

687
00:48:53,927 --> 00:49:09,166
Rym: so in 84 the new Scooby-Doo show ended mm-hmm and then there was this 13 goes to Scooby-Doo and then there's a gap and then sort of like there's this separate next era with a pup named Scooby-Doo right.

688
00:49:09,186 --> 00:49:13,207
Scott: so pup named Scooby-Doo was a show that was in my youth I hate on TV.

689
00:49:13,288 --> 00:49:17,026
Scott: I literally when I was like seven or eight years old it was on I'd bitch about it.

690
00:49:17,106 --> 00:49:19,217
Rym: I usually still watch it because I was watching TV.

691
00:49:19,298 --> 00:49:21,830
Scott: it was a show that I only watched.

692
00:49:22,252 --> 00:49:25,932
Scott: it wasn't it like you know it's not about like x-men and which came a few years later.

693
00:49:25,993 --> 00:49:29,753
Scott: oh well yeah it was Casey Kasem but like I was if x-men was on I was watching it.

694
00:49:29,814 --> 00:49:35,922
Scott: pup named Scooby-Doo was a show that like you'd watch if you didn't even have a video game to play cuz it was so bland.

695
00:49:36,002 --> 00:49:41,980
Scott: but that show also had some other shows that tied in with it.

696
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:46,429
Scott: the same way when you watch Rocky and Bullwinkle you also get a fractured fairy tale and it don't do right.

697
00:49:46,831 --> 00:49:59,857
Scott: well one of the Scooby-Doo's was always paired with Captain Caveman right I don't know there was a Flintstones or there was a Flintstones remake and a Scooby-Doo remake but Captain Caveman was in there somewhere right and Captain Caveman at least I liked it.

698
00:49:59,877 --> 00:50:04,538
Rym: I don't know if anyone else did but I didn't like it at all but I watched it.

699
00:50:04,739 --> 00:50:11,502
Scott: I like Captain Caveman uh but I don't know if I'd like to caveman and son and the teen angels.

700
00:50:12,005 --> 00:50:12,569
Scott: I don't remember them.

701
00:50:12,911 --> 00:50:15,444
Rym: that's the name of the show captain caveman and the Teen Angels what?

702
00:50:16,328 --> 00:50:25,539
Scott: I don't remember that at Teen Angels part at all anyway really no it was literally always those two things are you sure?

703
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:27,887
Scott: that's not that particular episode is.

704
00:50:28,148 --> 00:50:29,433
Scott: and the Teen Angels then?

705
00:50:29,614 --> 00:50:30,397
Rym: no that is.

706
00:50:30,558 --> 00:50:33,531
Rym: the show is called Captain Caveman and this I don't remember this at all.

707
00:50:33,671 --> 00:50:36,885
Scott: anyway I remember Captain Caveman and son.

708
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:38,894
Scott: maybe that was cat.

709
00:50:38,914 --> 00:50:41,003
Scott: it was also a remake of an older captain caveman.

710
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:41,466
Scott: I've never seen.

711
00:50:41,486 --> 00:50:43,697
Scott: you don't think so I don't.

712
00:50:43,717 --> 00:50:44,864
Rym: well we should have separate episode.

713
00:50:44,884 --> 00:50:45,447
Rym: captain cave who

714
00:50:45,487 --> 00:51:01,456
Scott: knows the point is pup named Scooby-Doo had only basically one redeeming factor right besides being paired in the same slot with other shorts that were better and that is they had this character red herring who was not in the any other Scooby-Doo that I know of.

715
00:51:01,878 --> 00:51:08,891
Scott: and basically red herring was the typical bully character where I had red curly hair ginger kid sort of buff and whatever.

716
00:51:08,951 --> 00:51:11,161
Rym: right and Fred will always blame him right.

717
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:13,995
Scott: he would bully all the Scooby-Doo kids who were nerds.

718
00:51:14,076 --> 00:51:20,120
Scott: right you know even Fred was busy a nerd even though he doesn't look like one visually right he was.

719
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:27,892
Scott: he's a lot like that kid on Salute Your Shorts with the red hair or the kid on Doug with the green face and the red hair.

720
00:51:28,153 --> 00:51:28,374
Scott: right.

721
00:51:28,414 --> 00:51:29,278
Rym: he was Roger Klotz.

722
00:51:29,399 --> 00:51:32,996
Scott: yes basically red herring is Roger Klotz or actually vice versa.

723
00:51:33,016 --> 00:51:41,816
Scott: cuz Roger Klotz came later right and red herring would both woods in the early part of the episode when they were in school and still the mystery hadn't been revealed.

724
00:51:41,856 --> 00:51:49,310
Scott: yet red herring would bully them right and then later on in the episode like clockwork because even pup named Scooby-Doo was formulaic.

725
00:51:49,752 --> 00:51:52,647
Scott: okay they would blame red herring saying it was him.

726
00:51:52,728 --> 00:51:54,036
Scott: he's the one who did the man.

727
00:51:54,076 --> 00:51:54,660
Scott: it was never him.

728
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,729
Rym: obviously it was him one time.

729
00:51:56,789 --> 00:51:57,694
Scott: it was him one time.

730
00:51:57,734 --> 00:52:03,555
Rym: so that episode which I do remember Fred was like now it's not him it was.

731
00:52:03,696 --> 00:52:09,725
Scott: they would blame it on him every time and then he would be like it's not me you numb nuts or whatever and like punch them or something right.

732
00:52:10,107 --> 00:52:15,612
Scott: I got that character a red herring and that joke of red herring I still think it's funny.

733
00:52:15,692 --> 00:52:16,657
Scott: the captain came in on.

734
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:17,340
Scott: nothing else about.

735
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:18,003
Scott: the show is good.

736
00:52:18,204 --> 00:52:22,244
Rym: the captain caveman intro is literally an origin story where the teen angels.

737
00:52:22,586 --> 00:52:24,756
Scott: fine I've never seen this captain caveman.

738
00:52:24,797 --> 00:52:26,123
Scott: this must be the original one.

739
00:52:26,204 --> 00:52:27,732
Rym: this is the original captain.

740
00:52:28,054 --> 00:52:28,556
Scott: I didn't know.

741
00:52:28,697 --> 00:52:33,322
Scott: I thought the captain caveman that I saw which is apparently a remake was actually the original.

742
00:52:33,362 --> 00:52:33,845
Scott: but it's not.

743
00:52:33,885 --> 00:52:34,488
Scott: it was a remake.

744
00:52:34,508 --> 00:52:40,095
Scott: so the captain caveman I saw was much like pup named Scooby-Doo a remake and was captain caveman and son.

745
00:52:40,718 --> 00:52:43,390
Scott: I've never seen captain caveman and the teen angels ever not even once.

746
00:52:43,692 --> 00:52:46,984
Rym: so get back to what I was getting at.

747
00:52:47,004 --> 00:52:57,820
Rym: the line was suddenly the show stopped being people faking monsters for commercial gain and started being actual fucking monsters.

748
00:52:58,382 --> 00:52:59,185
Scott: I've never seen that.

749
00:52:59,466 --> 00:52:59,988
Rym: the.

750
00:53:00,189 --> 00:53:01,273
Rym: that's most of Scooby-Doo.

751
00:53:01,514 --> 00:53:02,236
Scott: I've never seen that.

752
00:53:02,859 --> 00:53:06,537
Scott: I have never seen even one Scooby-Doo with an actual literal monster.

753
00:53:06,577 --> 00:53:08,467
Scott: it was always someone in a mask every time.

754
00:53:09,332 --> 00:53:10,216
Rym: yeah let's see what is.

755
00:53:10,237 --> 00:53:11,201
Scott: I'm not saying they don't exist.

756
00:53:11,241 --> 00:53:12,587
Scott: I'm saying I personally haven't seen one.

757
00:53:12,607 --> 00:53:20,741
Rym: see 1987 to 1988. blah blah blah blah blah yep the Jets it's Flintstones and the Jetsons of rehab Flintstones and Jetsons.

758
00:53:21,202 --> 00:53:22,104
Rym: we do shows on those.

759
00:53:25,473 --> 00:53:27,939
Rym: yep they met they met actual monsters.

760
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:32,599
Scott: I've never seen one with an actual monster in several along the way.

761
00:53:32,619 --> 00:53:36,599
Rym: they're running monsters man monsters yep it even says actual monsters in this Wikipedia.

762
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:49,903
Rym: at one point all right but uh yeah I. uh it's weird to me that I've seen so much Scooby-Doo and until I looked at this Wikipedia article I couldn't place where they existed.

763
00:53:49,943 --> 00:54:12,211
Rym: in this continuum I probably have seen none of the newer Scooby-Doo and as a kid a big part of why I didn't like Scooby-Doo is that once I had middle school actually late elementary school I started watching anime and because I was watching anime in elementary school Scooby-Doo just looked like shit and I just didn't like.

764
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:22,942
Rym: I think I was one of those kids who saw one anime when I was in like fourth grade and suddenly all American cartoons are shit because the only American cartoons I knew about were things like Scooby-Doo.

765
00:54:22,962 --> 00:54:29,400
Rym: so I was comparing 80s anime to 70s American low-budget cartoons.

766
00:54:29,781 --> 00:54:32,029
Scott: right I mean the thing is Scooby-Doo.

767
00:54:32,049 --> 00:54:42,110
Scott: I only watched you know like the older Scooby-Doo's I actually watched later on when I we had cable and when we got Cartoon Network which was rerunning them.

768
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:42,391
Scott: right.

769
00:54:42,673 --> 00:54:51,611
Scott: I wasn't able to see those and I was younger and even then they looked like crap because that was like you know the mid to late 90s ish area right.

770
00:54:51,912 --> 00:55:03,797
Scott: and I was now compare even compared not forget anime even compared to other crap shows like or not crap shows but just nor you know shows like Ninja Turtles or real ghostbusters or

771
00:55:04,058 --> 00:55:06,748
Rym: ghostbusters textures relatively good

772
00:55:06,768 --> 00:55:11,184
Scott: or Dexter's lab or stuff like that like it looked like crap compared to that.

773
00:55:11,525 --> 00:55:12,289
Scott: yeah so.

774
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:20,098
Scott: and even compared to other Hanna-Barbera shows like Thunder the Barbarian or Space Ghost or you know any of that yet?

775
00:55:20,158 --> 00:55:27,930
Scott: well I guess Thunder the Barbarian wasn't actually Hanna-Barbera but it was what's it called.

776
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:28,310
Scott: forget.

777
00:55:28,331 --> 00:55:34,710
Scott: yeah the other company right but the point is is that could even compared to the other old shows it didn't.

778
00:55:35,012 --> 00:55:37,060
Scott: it was bad right visually speak.

779
00:55:37,301 --> 00:55:49,552
Rym: yep so anime really ruined my like continued fandom from elementary school onward of any of this stuff and I still watched it all and I'd really that's just that that was like the TV generation.

780
00:55:49,572 --> 00:55:50,961
Rym: TV would be on and I'd watch it.

781
00:55:51,141 --> 00:55:53,709
Scott: yeah and it's weird.

782
00:55:53,749 --> 00:55:55,054
Scott: how much you know?

783
00:55:55,254 --> 00:55:57,643
Scott: it's not weird it's just there's a lot of.

784
00:55:57,703 --> 00:56:02,207
Rym: is that the kids to our kids today is that gonna be what Minecraft livestreamers are to them like?

785
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:04,218
Rym: wasn't good but I just watched it.

786
00:56:04,298 --> 00:56:05,063
Rym: cuz that's what you did.

787
00:56:05,103 --> 00:56:06,915
Rym: you sat down and watch whatever was on YouTube.

788
00:56:07,096 --> 00:56:21,033
Scott: well no but I think is that there were the fact because of TV right there were these single identical things that we all consumed just because they were on regardless of what we were actually a fan of.

789
00:56:21,094 --> 00:56:28,888
Rym: like when The Simpsons aired literally everyone in school the next day except the kids in religious households saw it right.

790
00:56:28,908 --> 00:56:41,828
Scott: but it's like because whether you're a fan of Batman or not everyone of our generation knows Batman because you watched a B test if it was on and you can assume literally anyone you interacted with who was in your peer group also watched it.

791
00:56:41,989 --> 00:56:45,424
Scott: yeah people just know it right but there's things like that.

792
00:56:45,465 --> 00:56:49,527
Scott: there's nothing that all the people of generate good enough generations under us younger.

793
00:56:49,848 --> 00:56:52,701
Scott: there's nothing that all everyone knows you can't?

794
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:53,042
Scott: you know?

795
00:56:53,083 --> 00:56:56,578
Scott: they kids can go to each other and be like oh did you see?

796
00:56:56,698 --> 00:57:03,295
Scott: one kid has seen My Little Pony and the other one doesn't even fucking know there's a My Little Pony show and the other one saw some Minecraft guy.

797
00:57:03,315 --> 00:57:06,654
Scott: the other person doesn't even know that Minecraft guy exists because there's.

798
00:57:06,734 --> 00:57:11,828
Scott: no there's no single identical monoculture like absorbing them all.

799
00:57:11,988 --> 00:57:15,634
Rym: now that's part of drove me so hard into anime fandom so early.

800
00:57:15,654 --> 00:57:16,559
Rym: it was that I saw the anime.

801
00:57:16,579 --> 00:57:23,063
Rym: it was great and no one I talked to at any idea at all and they were dubious and they wouldn't watch it.

802
00:57:23,305 --> 00:57:24,229
Rym: and it was weird to them.

803
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:40,067
Scott: and this is why you see Hollywood is banking hard on remaking the things that are part of that sort of our era which is that era end of TV monoculture era because after that there's no other monocultures to remake.

804
00:57:40,268 --> 00:57:42,718
Scott: yeah you get past the 90s so they're not.

805
00:57:42,758 --> 00:57:50,952
Scott: when you know when the top when the cycle goes around a decade and Hollywood wants to make remakes for the generations after us what are they gonna remake?

806
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:54,202
Rym: I mean what would be.

807
00:57:54,282 --> 00:57:57,200
Rym: so there was that 70s show right and then they made that 80s show.

808
00:57:57,803 --> 00:58:02,102
Rym: what the fuck would be the difference between the that 2000 show and that 2010 show.

809
00:58:02,925 --> 00:58:04,612
Scott: right it's like what are they gonna even fucking do?

810
00:58:05,837 --> 00:58:06,017
Scott: so?

811
00:58:06,037 --> 00:58:09,470
Rym: yeah if you really like Scooby-doo that's okay.

812
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:14,870
Scott: I mean I guess sure it's not a bit like it's a bad thing even to my kid brain.

813
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:17,460
Rym: it was so formulaic that it bothered me.

814
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:22,981
Scott: yes you even do a kid brain you can tell but it's a thing because I would watch it.

815
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:26,560
Rym: if they you know bad at the characters like it's obviously that guy.

816
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:29,638
Rym: why do I have to sit here for an entire episode just for you to figure out?

817
00:58:29,699 --> 00:58:40,063
Scott: it's that guy the second guy you know what though for as bad as the the plots and the animation and all the problems of Scooby-doo right the characters are actually kind of okay.

818
00:58:40,565 --> 00:58:45,059
Rym: yeah as people he sucked Fred was competent dad.

819
00:58:45,099 --> 00:58:48,779
Scott: they were at least somewhat unique compared to other characters and other shows.

820
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:52,375
Rym: a little bit I give it that like they all had their deal they're all white.

821
00:58:53,059 --> 00:58:55,150
Rym: yeah because that's style of the time.

822
00:58:55,191 --> 00:58:57,201
Scott: two of them were ladies and one of them was a dog.

823
00:58:57,342 --> 00:58:59,130
Scott: yeah one of those they recognize.

824
00:58:59,291 --> 00:59:03,472
Scott: because in the earliest episodes the guy who looks like he's supposed to be like mr.

825
00:59:03,512 --> 00:59:04,578
Scott: America really isn't?

826
00:59:04,618 --> 00:59:05,300
Scott: he's kind of dumb.

827
00:59:05,481 --> 00:59:16,398
Rym: yeah Scooby was less dumb than Shaggy but more cowardly.

828
00:59:16,418 --> 00:59:18,726
Rym: I think she was actually more cowardly.

829
00:59:18,746 --> 00:59:20,898
Scott: they were both really really cowardly.

830
00:59:20,918 --> 00:59:22,306
Rym: Scooby would occasionally step up.

831
00:59:22,386 --> 00:59:23,895
Rym: I don't think Shaggy ever stepped up.

832
00:59:24,177 --> 00:59:25,182
Scott: well you know what it was.

833
00:59:25,243 --> 00:59:27,533
Scott: I think is that perhaps shit.

834
00:59:27,573 --> 00:59:28,959
Scott: they were both super cowardly.

835
00:59:29,059 --> 00:59:31,189
Scott: but I think perhaps Shaggy was less alert.

836
00:59:31,209 --> 00:59:41,533
Scott: so usually you'd have Scooby in Shaggy's arms yeah and then Shaggy realizes and then also runs yeah but Scooby would occasionally do something that advanced the plot.

837
00:59:41,834 --> 00:59:44,165
Rym: as far as I know Shaggy would just fuck up and run away.

838
00:59:44,185 --> 00:59:56,015
Rym: mmm Scooby would do things accidentally to advance the plot by stumbling upon something although as a kid I never understood that Scooby and Shaggy were definitely getting high all the time.

839
00:59:56,116 --> 00:59:59,129
Scott: oh yes that's why I understand that until I understood what weed was.

840
00:59:59,149 --> 01:00:07,756
Scott: yeah but I think the reason you remember Scooby doing stuff is because they would bribe him with Scooby snacks to do something but they could buy died.

841
01:00:07,816 --> 01:00:09,947
Rym: I feel like you could bribe shaggy with weeds.

842
01:00:10,067 --> 01:00:11,213
Scott: you can't have that on TV.

843
01:00:11,635 --> 01:00:13,323
Rym: yeah I feel like Scooby snacks were just weed.

844
01:00:13,463 --> 01:00:15,071
Scott: yes yes they were.

845
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:16,116
Scott: there were weed biscuits.

846
01:00:16,136 --> 01:00:18,366
Scott: so we cracked the code give your dog weed biscuit.

847
01:00:18,386 --> 01:00:19,832
Scott: it's not a crack code.

848
01:00:19,852 --> 01:00:20,595
Scott: everyone knows this.

849
01:00:21,338 --> 01:00:23,804
Scott: talk about it until now in this episode.

850
01:00:23,824 --> 01:00:26,008
Rym: all right I think we're done here.
