1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,939
Rym: It's Monday, June 27th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:10,160
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,197 --> 00:00:13,649
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,055
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,075 --> 00:00:18,210
Rym: Tonight we are talking about refrigeration technology.

6
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,428
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:24,006
Rym: And finally, we are free.

8
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:25,634
Rym: Hockey is over.

9
00:00:25,815 --> 00:00:27,866
Rym: I don't have to think about, "Oh, when's the next hockey

10
00:00:27,886 --> 00:00:28,369
Rym: game?"

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,310
Rym: Until, uh... For a little while.

12
00:00:31,993 --> 00:00:32,460
Scott: Four months?

13
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,149
Scott: Three or four months?

14
00:00:33,615 --> 00:00:33,828
Rym: Yup.

15
00:00:34,412 --> 00:00:38,470
Rym: And all I'll say is, you know what, I was rooting for the Avalanche because, one, they were gonna win anyway.

16
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,379
Rym: Like, that path was determined.

17
00:00:41,002 --> 00:00:42,470
Rym: Round one showed me the way.

18
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:47,170
Scott: I mean, I thought they were gonna win since early in the regular season.

19
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:54,950
Scott: But, on the other hand, it's like, you know, none of these, either team, neither one was a team that I hated or had bad people on it.

20
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,550
Scott: You know, that I was aware of or anything.

21
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:06,350
Rym: Though, what's funny is, right around this time, you see that ESPN has that big documentary about, basically, the hockey era of my childhood, the Red Wings-Avalanche rivalry.

22
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,309
Scott: Yeah, 'cause they've went against each other several years.

23
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:10,432
Rym: Exactly.

24
00:01:10,452 --> 00:01:12,278
Rym: But it's no longer a rivalry.

25
00:01:12,298 --> 00:01:13,663
Rym: Like, the teams don't give a shit about each other.

26
00:01:13,743 --> 00:01:15,830
Rym: Like, the hockey's very different now, but...

27
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,150
Scott: Well, divisions change and all sorts of stuff, right?

28
00:01:20,252 --> 00:01:24,065
Rym: But, I'm very happy that the Rangers made it as far as the conference finals.

29
00:01:24,566 --> 00:01:25,550
Rym: Nothing to cry about.

30
00:01:26,351 --> 00:01:28,089
Scott: They did not think we were gonna make it there.

31
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:29,291
Rym: Yep.

32
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:35,449
Rym: And now, this is one of those teams, Rangers have got a few years of "stay this good and just keep trying for a

33
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:35,630
Rym: cup.".

34
00:01:35,731 --> 00:01:37,425
Rym: And maybe it'll happen, maybe it won't, but...

35
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:45,010
Scott: The problem is, is like, the Rangers are quite good, you know, but you look at these teams, like the Avalanche specifically, right?

36
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,539
Scott: And it's like, you could just see, they're so far ahead of the other teams.

37
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:55,570
Scott: It's like, you know, if the average team is a strength of five, right?

38
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,769
Scott: The Rangers might have a strength of seven and a half or eight.

39
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:05,383
Scott: And there's a lot of teams with a similar strength of seven and a half, eight, nine, right?

40
00:02:05,743 --> 00:02:08,710
Scott: But the Avalanche have a strength of like, eleven or twelve.

41
00:02:09,431 --> 00:02:10,627
Rym: Well, I think, so I read a bunch...

42
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,665
Scott: And nobody else is like, you know, up there.

43
00:02:12,725 --> 00:02:13,169
Scott: It's like, well...

44
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,384
Rym: I read a bunch of analysis of people trying to say like, what's the deal?

45
00:02:16,404 --> 00:02:17,570
Rym: Like, what exactly is happening?

46
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:21,910
Rym: And there actually are pretty common themes, even among a bunch of people who normally disagree with each other.

47
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:30,330
Rym: But they seem to come down to more depth in the team, like better coordination among the lines, like really just basic stuff.

48
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:38,690
Rym: But also, everyone made the point that they are proof that you do not need a good goalie to be a good NHL team.

49
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,229
Scott: Well, you have to have an okay goalie.

50
00:02:40,391 --> 00:02:44,270
Rym: Oh no, but I saw people pointing out that people making an argument that they didn't even need a good goalie.

51
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,709
Rym: Their goalie didn't even actually have to deal with that many shots.

52
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,137
Scott: I mean, yeah, that's definitely part of it, right?

53
00:02:50,198 --> 00:02:53,890
Scott: You know, but he did, he was slightly subpar, right?

54
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:58,710
Scott: I think he let in like a few over expected, but it's not like he was awful or terrible or anything.

55
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:04,430
Scott: If you had a terrible goalie, so many more, you know, he did make saves, they would have gone in if you had a terrible goalie, right?

56
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:09,489
Rym: But look, Vasilevski and Shasturkin, two of the best goalies in the game right now.

57
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:18,130
Rym: And yet, I think we have discovered, as we talked about before when we were in for this matchup, we were about to see the immovable object versus the unstoppable force.

58
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,230
Rym: Turns out an unstoppable force will beat an immovable object every time in hockey.

59
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:28,310
Scott: Right, because even the greatest goalie, they're not a superhuman who can just stop every single shot no matter how ridiculous, right?

60
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:37,190
Scott: So therefore, it's, you know, it's like if you have the best goalie in the universe, but the rest of your team isn't good enough, the other team is going to get a million shots.

61
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:42,564
Scott: And even though only 0.05% of them go in, it's like they just make enough shots.

62
00:03:42,825 --> 00:03:44,770
Scott: and they make good enough ones, they're going to go in.

63
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:50,407
Scott: And if your team can't get into the offensive zone, you can't score goals and the other team could just beat you 1-0.

64
00:03:50,507 --> 00:03:51,310
Scott: It could happen.

65
00:03:51,511 --> 00:03:57,370
Rym: Yeah, I did see one argument though that Colorado has the extra X factor of their high elevation team.

66
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:13,350
Scott: So I think that's, I think there's some, you know, it's not completely without merit, but I think it is nonsense because if that was the case, we would see Colorado teams in all athletic sports winning more often on average.

67
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:19,543
Rym: Not necessarily because that type of, like, the equivalent of doping, it's basically natural doping.

68
00:04:19,603 --> 00:04:22,250
Rym: Doping meaning putting extra red blood cells in, essentially.

69
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:29,570
Rym: That only primarily benefits you in extreme endurance sports, but not in, like, other kinds of explosive action sports.

70
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:40,010
Rym: The point, we don't see people who come from higher elevations doing better on average in, like, foot races and many types of track and field events.

71
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:46,130
Scott: The best track and field people are all from, like, you know, Nigeria.

72
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:55,390
Rym: Yeah, but statistically, of course, there are individuals who can overcome anything like that, but overall, high elevation training is effective at certain kinds of sports.

73
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,519
Rym: But anyway, hockey's done.

74
00:04:57,539 --> 00:04:58,766
Rym: Don't have to worry about hockey anymore.

75
00:04:58,786 --> 00:04:59,470
Rym: I heard you got a plant.

76
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,534
Scott: Well, I mean, so I had, you know, I had a lot of house plants, right?

77
00:05:03,674 --> 00:05:15,249
Scott: But the thing with the house plants is that, you know, it's hard to, if you just, you know, buy plants and it's, like, at a random place, you know, just say, "Oh, that plant looks nice.

78
00:05:15,309 --> 00:05:15,650
Scott: I'll buy

79
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:15,750
Scott: it.".

80
00:05:16,111 --> 00:05:19,890
Scott: You don't know, A, what kind of plant it is specifically, how to take care of it.

81
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:24,210
Rym: Maybe at best it's got that little card that gives you vague instructions that assume you know a lot.

82
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:32,850
Scott: Yeah, and then it's, like, if you don't have, you know, a garage or a yard, it's, like, it's hard to take care of plants just in a pot in an apartment.

83
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,813
Scott: It's, like, what are you going to do?

84
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,557
Scott: You buy a bag of dirt?

85
00:05:34,577 --> 00:05:36,385
Scott: Where are you going to put a bag of dirt in an apartment?

86
00:05:36,425 --> 00:05:38,592
Scott: You don't have a, it's, like, We have a container.

87
00:05:38,612 --> 00:05:39,835
Rym: Remember the old GeekNights container?

88
00:05:39,855 --> 00:05:46,230
Rym: That is currently on the balcony, and in that container is the bag of dirt and a bunch of other stuff like that.

89
00:05:46,632 --> 00:05:48,750
Scott: You have not wasted my balcony space on bag of dirt.

90
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,350
Rym: Our balcony's huge, so it doesn't really take up any material about a space.

91
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:58,084
Scott: The point is, is that it's a pain in the ass to do things like repotting plants or whatever.

92
00:05:58,104 --> 00:06:00,770
Scott: You know, there's nowhere to go to do that, right?

93
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:14,350
Scott: So, uh, one of the things I planned to do during my time of not work, which has got a couple more weeks left, uh, was go take care of the houseplants because they're all alive, but some of them were falling over because they were too big for the pot.

94
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:24,610
Scott: Some of them were alive but sad, you know, so I took them to this plant store, and the plant store was basically the ideal retail establishment, right?

95
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:29,489
Scott: So, you know, we always talk about just buy shit online, it's cheaper, right, you know?

96
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:37,030
Rym: Well, what we always say, we always said, unless you need to talk to an expert and the store you're going to will have an expert.

97
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:44,730
Scott: Right, retail stores usually don't have experts, don't have good selection, don't have good prices, don't offer anything, right?

98
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:56,510
Scott: But this particular plant store, I go in, and I, you know, I went up to the counter where, you know, this woman was sitting, and I, you know, but she, you know, didn't seem like she wanted to help me.

99
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:04,490
Scott: She seemed like she was, right, like working and cashiering and that sort of thing, and like she didn't want a customer service very much.

100
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:12,770
Scott: And it turns out this other person in the store, this broey dude, who I didn't, who I just thought was a customer, was actually the owner.

101
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:30,650
Scott: And he was, you know, it's like you look at this guy, and if you had seen this dude in any other setting, the street, you know, the park, anywhere, you'd think he was just some broey dude who was, you know, gonna get drunk, party, drive a fart car, right?

102
00:07:30,852 --> 00:07:31,507
Rym: And he might be.

103
00:07:33,311 --> 00:07:33,972
Scott: Right, in New York too.

104
00:07:33,992 --> 00:07:42,010
Scott: But this dude was the owner of a plant store and an enormous plant nerd, like plant nerd the way that we're a computer nerd, right?

105
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,234
Scott: And he was so happy, right?

106
00:07:44,294 --> 00:07:52,990
Scott: It's like what he was doing would have normally counted as mansplaining, if not the fact that I was specifically asking for the explanation.

107
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,974
Rym: It's funny, we had the same experience recently.

108
00:07:54,994 --> 00:07:58,841
Rym: There's a little plant store that has a lot of succulents near us, like by the huntress.

109
00:07:59,222 --> 00:08:01,988
Rym: Same deal, the people in there know everything.

110
00:08:02,008 --> 00:08:03,150
Rym: They're like mega plant nerds.

111
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:09,580
Scott: Right, this dude is a huge plant nerd, you know, and he repotted my plants, and he's like, "Oh, you gotta get some fertilizer for this

112
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:09,940
Scott: one.".

113
00:08:10,001 --> 00:08:11,022
Scott: And he's like, "You should get this

114
00:08:11,082 --> 00:08:11,503
Scott: kind.".

115
00:08:11,563 --> 00:08:12,385
Scott: And I'm like, "Do you sell

116
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:12,565
Scott: that?".

117
00:08:12,585 --> 00:08:15,149
Scott: And he's like, "No, I don't sell

118
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:15,350
Scott: that.".

119
00:08:15,671 --> 00:08:20,630
Rym: That's the surest sign of a real expert in a store, if they will recommend things that they don't even sell.

120
00:08:21,431 --> 00:08:27,246
Scott: And I was like, "Yeah, this plant came with this kind of dirt, but I had to switch it to this kind of dirt because I couldn't find the kind of dirt it came

121
00:08:27,286 --> 00:08:27,447
Scott: with.".

122
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:28,449
Scott: And he's like, "I make my own

123
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:28,630
Scott: dirt.".

124
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:42,370
Scott: Alright, but he repotted my plants, and I bought a new plant there, and I got some newer pots, and now my houseplant situation is all very nice now.

125
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:49,650
Rym: I think there's something to this ongoing belief and assumption and pop culture idea that millennials are obsessed with plants.

126
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:56,580
Scott: Houseplant popularity is actually way up, which is probably why stores like that are successful.

127
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,506
Scott: People got plants in their houses, you know.

128
00:09:00,548 --> 00:09:01,470
Scott: They want more, you know.

129
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,756
Scott: People want plants when they had offices.

130
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:08,990
Scott: You know, every office I've ever worked in, people are always having plants at the desk, right?

131
00:09:10,953 --> 00:09:12,562
Rym: I wonder if we're allowed to have plants that are desks.

132
00:09:12,582 --> 00:09:13,970
Rym: I've never seen one at anyone's desk.

133
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:15,277
Scott: Really, never?

134
00:09:15,378 --> 00:09:16,529
Scott: I've never not seen one.

135
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,170
Rym: I mean, our desks are tiny at work.

136
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:28,166
Scott: I guess my past three jobs, which is going back, you know, a long time because I kept the jobs for a long time each, but that's like 15 years' worth.

137
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,030
Scott: People always had plants.

138
00:09:31,811 --> 00:09:33,684
Rym: The only thing on my desk is one little goomba.

139
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,556
Scott: The only thing on my desk now is nothing.

140
00:09:37,616 --> 00:09:39,341
Scott: I don't have an office desk anymore.

141
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:39,863
Scott: I just have this.

142
00:09:39,943 --> 00:09:40,846
Scott: This is my only desk.

143
00:09:40,866 --> 00:09:42,070
Scott: I got one.

144
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,031
Rym: Get in the news.

145
00:09:43,272 --> 00:09:45,495
Rym: One non-tech news, but we can't not talk about it.

146
00:09:45,655 --> 00:09:48,719
Rym: Of course, go read Real News to find out more.

147
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:56,050
Rym: If you're hearing about this from GeekNights, once again, I don't know what to say except go read something.

148
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,185
Scott: Maybe they're from another country or something.

149
00:09:58,205 --> 00:09:58,910
Scott: You know, I don't know.

150
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:03,939
Rym: Yeah, if you're in the US and you're hearing about this from us, shame on you.

151
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,068
Rym: But if you're outside the US, this has grave portents for other countries, too.

152
00:10:09,128 --> 00:10:10,270
Rym: This is a big problem.

153
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:23,130
Rym: Basically, of course, the US Supreme Court has been compromised because the traitor guy who took over our government in an illegitimate election in 2016 cheated and appointed a bunch of people to our court.

154
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:28,920
Rym: If you're not familiar with the American courts, basically our Supreme Court is invincible.

155
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:34,190
Rym: The people on it are appointed for life and there is zero accountability and supreme power.

156
00:10:35,232 --> 00:10:38,730
Rym: And we're kind of screwed right now because there's no way to kick someone off the Supreme Court.

157
00:10:39,093 --> 00:10:41,350
Scott: You can impeach them, but it's basically impossible.

158
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:50,185
Rym: It requires a supermajority in our Senate, which is 50% controlled by the fascists and unable to be changed significantly for reasons.

159
00:10:50,285 --> 00:10:55,650
Scott: So we're in deep shit and they've basically- At least if you agree to follow the rules that are written in the Constitution.

160
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,945
Rym: Yeah, which that would be a coup.

161
00:10:59,307 --> 00:11:00,496
Scott: I'm not saying- Which we're still doing.

162
00:11:00,658 --> 00:11:02,050
Scott: We're still doing for now, right?

163
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:03,413
Rym: To a degree.

164
00:11:03,473 --> 00:11:11,670
Rym: The Department of Justice and the military effectively said that they're going to ignore state laws and make sure that service members can get whatever health care they need, which is a start.

165
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,329
Scott: But if it's on federal land, then there's nothing they could do.

166
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:25,930
Rym: But basically what this means is about half of the American states either have now or will imminently ban basically all abortions.

167
00:11:26,351 --> 00:11:31,570
Rym: And the other half of America's states are enshrining the right to abortions in their own constitutions.

168
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:38,190
Rym: And the Republican Party in our country has said pretty much straight up that if they take back the government, they're going to ban it nationally.

169
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,657
Rym: They're going to pass a law that just bans it in all 50 states.

170
00:11:41,419 --> 00:11:47,450
Scott: So the only way- Oh, but we could just filibuster that forever the same as they do.

171
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,392
Rym: Nope.

172
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:54,630
Rym: If they pass it, they could overturn the filibuster because you only need 51 votes to overturn the filibuster and change the rules.

173
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,918
Rym: Well, we don't have 51 votes.

174
00:11:56,938 --> 00:11:59,908
Rym: We have 48 Democratic senators and two traitors.

175
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:11,821
Rym: So basically the only legal thing you can do if you're not down for a coup, other than protesting and harm mitigation, is effectively in the

176
00:12:11,921 --> 00:12:12,202
Rym: U.S.,

177
00:12:12,262 --> 00:12:18,229
Rym: we got to pick up at least one net seat in the Senate in the 2022 election.

178
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:25,930
Rym: Because a lot of people on the left who are screaming and freaking out are also kind of yelling at the wrong people in one specific regard.

179
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:34,590
Rym: Our Senate voted in May to overturn the filibuster and enshrine a basic form of abortion rights nationally, which would undermine this rule.

180
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:38,198
Rym: That bill went down 49 to 51.

181
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:40,584
Rym: One piece of shit.

182
00:12:40,604 --> 00:12:42,689
Rym: Democratic senator, Joe Manchin, voted against it.

183
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:50,910
Rym: Meaning if we pick up even one seat, we should be able to do the exact same vote and it would get through the filibuster on a technicality.

184
00:12:52,931 --> 00:12:54,415
Rym: So that's what we can do.

185
00:12:54,576 --> 00:12:58,387
Rym: And the most likely one is Pennsylvania, where the cool guy is running.

186
00:12:58,869 --> 00:12:59,270
Rym: Betterment.

187
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:09,130
Scott: But even if we do that, you know, we have to keep that because at any moment, if the other side takes over the government, they could just pass the opposite law.

188
00:13:09,431 --> 00:13:09,651
Rym: Yep.

189
00:13:09,712 --> 00:13:15,370
Rym: Well, once we get that, the other next step is we got to either pack the court or abolish the Supreme Court or do something.

190
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,637
Rym: We got to do something egregious, which is possible.

191
00:13:19,018 --> 00:13:20,863
Rym: Packing the court is something FDR threatened to do.

192
00:13:21,304 --> 00:13:23,850
Rym: It's doable, but it requires getting rid of the filibuster.

193
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,090
Scott: FDR was not a perfect individual.

194
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,210
Rym: Not saying he was, but in that regard...

195
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,400
Scott: He had guts to tell you.

196
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,730
Scott: this is what I want to happen and he made it happen, right?

197
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:34,131
Scott: Yep.

198
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:35,735
Rym: So we'll see.

199
00:13:36,136 --> 00:13:41,210
Rym: At least one more Democrat has to be in the Senate for anything to happen.

200
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:48,490
Scott: Well, I mean, it's just, you know, the same crisis that's been happening for a long time continues to happen.

201
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:49,290
Rym: Yep.

202
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:58,590
Rym: The American population is concentrated into a handful of states and the rest of the empty land gets overrepresented in our government because our Constitution is...

203
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,408
Scott: It's been this way since before we were born and we're still alive and...

204
00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:04,716
Rym: Our Constitution is old and crufty.

205
00:14:04,956 --> 00:14:09,264
Rym: And if you notice, we haven't amended it in a long time, except for trivial stuff.

206
00:14:09,525 --> 00:14:12,070
Rym: It's starting to run out of steam, that thing.

207
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:14,590
Scott: Oh, what are we going to do?

208
00:14:15,451 --> 00:14:15,992
Rym: We'll see.

209
00:14:16,393 --> 00:14:21,970
Rym: So I encourage you to read more about this and look at what options you have for doing something about it.

210
00:14:22,271 --> 00:14:24,339
Rym: And if you're against abortion, I don't know what to get.

211
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,584
Rym: Stop listening to GeekNights.

212
00:14:26,106 --> 00:14:27,010
Rym: Like, what are you even doing here?

213
00:14:29,431 --> 00:14:37,209
Rym: So in other news that is not that, you know, GeekNights Monday technology, Google is actually both of our newses.

214
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,710
Rym: Google is shutting down hangouts, which I feel like they have announced...

215
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,254
Scott: That's not news.

216
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:44,110
Scott: We knew this was announced a long time ago.

217
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:48,249
Rym: I feel like this has been announced at least half a dozen times in some form.

218
00:14:49,772 --> 00:14:52,450
Scott: They keep, you know, changing their fucking minds over there.

219
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:57,050
Scott: You know, it's like it's bad enough to start things and then, you know, get users and then turn them off.

220
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:04,350
Scott: It's another thing to like, you know, not just turn something off, but to like transition to other products and change branding.

221
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:12,650
Scott: And because now not only are you hurting people by turning off a thing that they've come to depend on, but you're now also confusing people, right?

222
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:18,421
Scott: It's like, you know, having allo and duo and chat and we are we are.

223
00:15:18,481 --> 00:15:23,430
Rym: we are terminally online technologists who have been doing a podcast for like 15 years on technology.

224
00:15:24,051 --> 00:15:29,910
Rym: And yet I have to go look up what the fuck Google is doing and what app does what in this ecosystem.

225
00:15:30,251 --> 00:15:30,451
Scott: Right.

226
00:15:30,491 --> 00:15:53,010
Scott: It seems like they're finally getting everything in order and that I don't know what the time frame on this is, but when all is said and done, they are going to have all of the text chatting consolidated into Google Chat, which will be a product that is somewhere in between like a Slack and a, you know, Hangout DM thing.

227
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:55,070
Scott: But no one's really going to use it, basically.

228
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,530
Rym: I mean, I don't even use Hangouts or any of this anymore.

229
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:04,750
Scott: We used to use it, but then, you know, I stopped using it years ago when they basically fucked it up.

230
00:16:04,971 --> 00:16:06,244
Scott: And then that was it.

231
00:16:06,973 --> 00:16:07,869
Rym: I moved everything into Discord.

232
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:08,972
Scott: I don't know anyone who.

233
00:16:09,152 --> 00:16:20,870
Scott: the only time I've seen it used recently is that, you know, if you were from working at companies, the companies I've worked for recently have used, you know, the Google Chat.

234
00:16:21,211 --> 00:16:22,355
Scott: Right.

235
00:16:23,197 --> 00:16:26,929
Scott: You know, as sort of like the backup if Slack goes down.

236
00:16:29,991 --> 00:16:38,010
Scott: So even if the companies have Google, you know, workspaces, you know, for their email, it's like they're only using that for email.

237
00:16:38,111 --> 00:16:40,870
Scott: They're not using that for chatting on a regular basis.

238
00:16:40,952 --> 00:16:41,830
Scott: They have Slack, right?

239
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:46,250
Scott: My ring light is having a problem with USB cable.

240
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:47,782
Scott: USB cable is flaky.

241
00:16:49,071 --> 00:16:55,570
Rym: Basically, when Google Hangouts started like breaking and all the problems happened, that's basically when I jumped ship to Discord.

242
00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:02,410
Rym: Today, I'd say that 80 percent of the people who want to talk to me just DM me on Discord or talk to me in a Discord.

243
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:05,510
Rym: Another like 10 percent still SMS me.

244
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:10,490
Rym: A handful of people, including my mom, Twitter DM me and everything else is email.

245
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,138
Rym: And that's it.

246
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:14,869
Scott: I mean, that's this is a sort of a fundamental thing.

247
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,530
Rym: I guess I roll SMS and signal together because they work the same way.

248
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:20,909
Rym: Like it doesn't matter which one's which when someone messages me.

249
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:27,849
Scott: The point is, is that any service in which requires any platform in which users make accounts.

250
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:28,591
Scott: Right.

251
00:17:29,694 --> 00:17:36,810
Scott: It becomes basically trivial for that service to add a feature which allows users to direct message each other.

252
00:17:37,351 --> 00:17:43,429
Scott: And even if that service is not a messaging service, that is, you know, where that is the primary use of it.

253
00:17:44,011 --> 00:17:44,312
Scott: Right.

254
00:17:44,794 --> 00:17:48,469
Scott: It becomes also a necessary and helpful feature.

255
00:17:48,649 --> 00:17:48,810
Scott: Right.

256
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,620
Scott: So let's say you have, I don't know, eBay.

257
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:51,485
Scott: Right.

258
00:17:53,092 --> 00:17:55,488
Scott: eBay's primary feature is buying and selling shit.

259
00:17:55,549 --> 00:17:55,710
Scott: Right.

260
00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:08,610
Scott: But if you're going to have a transaction with someone, it becomes useful and necessary to have some sort of way to message that person and come and converse with a person that you were having a transaction.

261
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:08,832
Scott: Yep.

262
00:18:08,933 --> 00:18:09,478
Rym: Like Uber.

263
00:18:09,983 --> 00:18:10,710
Rym: All the problems with Uber.

264
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:14,990
Rym: None of us said you got to be able to chat with the person who's picking you up in case like, wait, what intersection are you at?

265
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,159
Rym: You know, confusion.

266
00:18:16,645 --> 00:18:16,807
Rym: Airbnb.

267
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:28,570
Rym: Like there are good reasons for this in terms of if you have a conversation through the Airbnb platform, then the company has a record of that in case there's fraud or malfeasance.

268
00:18:28,992 --> 00:18:30,590
Rym: There's a lot of reasons why this makes sense.

269
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:36,510
Rym: But now to your point, I have all these like messaging systems that each have a very specific purpose.

270
00:18:38,511 --> 00:18:38,691
Scott: Yeah.

271
00:18:38,931 --> 00:18:39,752
Scott: I mean, you know, it's like.

272
00:18:39,772 --> 00:18:51,870
Scott: so what happens is there's all these DM platforms everywhere and people will just start using one and the platforms that used to exist that whose sole purpose was text messaging.

273
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:52,512
Scott: Right.

274
00:18:52,592 --> 00:18:59,590
Scott: Other than SMS, all the other ones have really kind of bitten it right in favor of things that are also something else.

275
00:18:59,730 --> 00:18:59,871
Scott: Right.

276
00:18:59,891 --> 00:19:06,130
Scott: You know, even your even your WhatsApp apps and things of that nature, it's like they're also sort of like a group chat thing.

277
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,052
Scott: And they all right.

278
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:08,978
Scott: Or, you know, it's like.

279
00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:13,050
Scott: Facebook is also Facebook Messenger and Instagram as DMS.

280
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:19,890
Scott: And even though it was primarily a photo thing originally, at least, you know, it's like so those end up getting all the users.

281
00:19:20,631 --> 00:19:25,549
Scott: And then, you know, things like Google Hangout is right falling over.

282
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,313
Rym: So, yep.

283
00:19:27,393 --> 00:19:35,470
Rym: So along those lines, even in more news, Google is combining duo, which I guess somehow still existed.

284
00:19:36,312 --> 00:19:38,238
Rym: I remember I installed duo.

285
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,730
Rym: It didn't work with domains at the time.

286
00:19:42,233 --> 00:19:42,758
Rym: So I never.

287
00:19:42,899 --> 00:19:44,209
Rym: I never used it even once.

288
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,658
Scott: I mean, that was the last time they tried to do this.

289
00:19:47,698 --> 00:19:51,389
Scott: They made that aloe in the duo and were like, OK, I forgot about aloe.

290
00:19:52,334 --> 00:19:52,596
Scott: Right.

291
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:53,890
Scott: It lasted five minutes.

292
00:19:54,232 --> 00:19:56,590
Rym: You know, whatever they launch them at like the same time.

293
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,192
Rym: And I did.

294
00:19:57,212 --> 00:20:01,610
Scott: That was the idea is that that was the original attempt was to replace hang out with aloe and duo.

295
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:08,530
Scott: And now they're basically they're going to have chat and they're going to have meat, which already meat is the only thing that Google has.

296
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:18,270
Scott: I think that's going to actually have sustained usage because any company that even a company that uses Google workspaces and pays for it is going to be using Slack or Microsoft Teams or something.

297
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,845
Scott: They're not going to be using the Google chat.

298
00:20:19,946 --> 00:20:20,128
Scott: Right.

299
00:20:20,952 --> 00:20:26,630
Scott: But the Google meet companies use that except for companies that might pay extra and use Zoom instead.

300
00:20:27,432 --> 00:20:28,458
Scott: Right.

301
00:20:29,182 --> 00:20:30,490
Scott: The actual the best ones.

302
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:31,492
Scott: Right.

303
00:20:31,592 --> 00:20:38,310
Scott: Still, to this day, I still believe that I message and especially FaceTime are the best as a product.

304
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:46,490
Scott: But they only work if everyone has an Apple device and therefore they're never going to be a solution for pretty much anyone.

305
00:20:46,772 --> 00:20:48,630
Rym: I used I only recently got an Apple device.

306
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:53,190
Rym: And even today, the vast majority of people I interact with online do not have even one Apple device.

307
00:20:53,871 --> 00:20:58,010
Scott: But even if they do have an Apple device, it's like as soon as you have one person who doesn't.

308
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:58,270
Scott: Right.

309
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:06,290
Scott: So it's like maybe the only people you talk to in your life are your family and they all have Apple devices, in which case it's going to be fantastic for you.

310
00:21:06,573 --> 00:21:06,797
Scott: Right.

311
00:21:06,918 --> 00:21:07,750
Scott: It's going to be amazing.

312
00:21:08,252 --> 00:21:14,410
Scott: Maybe every single friend you have, you're a high school student and all of your friends have iPhones, literally everybody.

313
00:21:14,571 --> 00:21:17,008
Scott: And you don't have a single person who doesn't have one.

314
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:17,230
Scott: Right.

315
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,843
Scott: It's going to be fantastic for you to use iMessage and FaceTime.

316
00:21:20,225 --> 00:21:21,130
Scott: Life is going to be great.

317
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:21,551
Scott: Right.

318
00:21:21,992 --> 00:21:27,990
Scott: But if you have just if you have online friends, if you're a connected person or if you're if you have friends in the community.

319
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:28,411
Scott: Right.

320
00:21:28,431 --> 00:21:42,270
Scott: You go to say, I don't know, a club or a volunteer group or a religious organization or a city council community or any kind of social group that you interact with.

321
00:21:42,492 --> 00:21:42,714
Scott: Right.

322
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,190
Scott: A bowling league.

323
00:21:44,631 --> 00:21:44,852
Scott: Right.

324
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:51,389
Scott: There's going to be at some point along the way, there's going to be people who are not using it.

325
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:52,031
Scott: Right.

326
00:21:52,592 --> 00:22:00,310
Scott: And it ends up being that the universal platforms that work, no matter what computer or device someone has.

327
00:22:01,151 --> 00:22:01,455
Scott: Right.

328
00:22:01,475 --> 00:22:02,730
Scott: Even if they're shittier.

329
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:03,392
Scott: Right.

330
00:22:03,412 --> 00:22:04,248
Scott: Zoom is shittier.

331
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:05,034
Scott: Right.

332
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:07,710
Scott: And FaceTime, it's going to win.

333
00:22:08,131 --> 00:22:08,333
Scott: Right.

334
00:22:08,413 --> 00:22:11,170
Scott: And so Google Meet is really good.

335
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:18,130
Scott: If you have a company and everyone's using Google Workspaces, everyone can use Google Meet and it works for in company stuff.

336
00:22:18,411 --> 00:22:24,610
Scott: But as soon as you have to interact with another company at that company is not using Google Workspaces also.

337
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:25,252
Scott: Guess what?

338
00:22:25,312 --> 00:22:29,770
Scott: Now your company is also going to use Zoom to interact with the other companies.

339
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:32,610
Rym: I haven't at least found that Zoom has displaced almost everything else.

340
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:35,269
Rym: And I find that every professional interaction I have is Zoom now.

341
00:22:36,051 --> 00:22:36,231
Scott: Right.

342
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:41,330
Scott: And then your company is going to be like, well, we have to interact with people outside the company and use Zoom.

343
00:22:41,911 --> 00:22:45,970
Scott: Then why the fuck are we going to use Google Meet for internal and Zoom for external?

344
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,441
Scott: Let's just use Zoom for everything.

345
00:22:47,461 --> 00:22:48,630
Scott: That way we're using less things.

346
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:50,750
Scott: And then you're not using Google Meet anymore.

347
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:51,226
Rym: Yeah.

348
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:56,209
Scott: So I think that's the fundamental thing Google has to do.

349
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,489
Rym: The sad thing, though, is...

350
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,788
Scott: It's products out there.

351
00:22:59,672 --> 00:23:02,950
Scott: I think it's sort of lost because, like, you know, it's like this.

352
00:23:03,932 --> 00:23:06,149
Scott: Are people even using Gmail anymore?

353
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,247
Scott: Like who need email?

354
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,550
Rym: Well, because no one sends emails.

355
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:14,530
Rym: I increasingly find that and not from an old person complaining if you should use email for everything, that's ridiculous.

356
00:23:14,711 --> 00:23:19,149
Rym: But email is good if you want to send someone like a whole ass page of text.

357
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:25,786
Rym: And I have people who will like SMS me a long thread.

358
00:23:25,846 --> 00:23:27,310
Rym: that could have just been one email.

359
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:28,471
Scott: Sure.

360
00:23:28,531 --> 00:23:33,851
Scott: But I'm saying it's like, you know, if there are people who are new... You know, we have Gmail because... Right.

361
00:23:34,354 --> 00:23:37,350
Scott: Like if I had to start using email today, I wouldn't choose Gmail.

362
00:23:38,176 --> 00:23:38,319
Scott: Right.

363
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:38,830
Scott: Not a chance.

364
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:42,910
Scott: The reason I use Gmail is because back in the day I had college email.

365
00:23:43,371 --> 00:23:43,592
Scott: Right.

366
00:23:43,652 --> 00:23:50,050
Scott: And at the time, everyone using the email their ISP gave them, whether that was the college or whatever, AOL or, you know, something.

367
00:23:50,692 --> 00:23:54,250
Scott: And then we entered the next period where it's like you weren't dependent.

368
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,409
Scott: Your ISP could no longer give you services.

369
00:23:56,671 --> 00:23:56,911
Scott: Right.

370
00:23:56,952 --> 00:24:02,470
Scott: Because they couldn't compete with the services like the ones that were provided by, you know, web apps.

371
00:24:02,971 --> 00:24:03,173
Scott: Right.

372
00:24:03,555 --> 00:24:05,830
Scott: So people moved to Gmail.

373
00:24:06,271 --> 00:24:06,512
Scott: Right.

374
00:24:07,175 --> 00:24:10,470
Scott: But now it's like, you know, at the time, Gmail was the only one.

375
00:24:10,634 --> 00:24:11,189
Scott: That was the game.

376
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:16,950
Rym: I would probably still use Gmail today because I'm thinking about all the alternatives and I would probably just get a Gmail account.

377
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:24,110
Scott: I would use maybe the iCloud email or there's some other ones out there that are that are good options also.

378
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,222
Rym: Not a ton though.

379
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,470
Rym: You start scraping the bottom of the barrel pretty quick.

380
00:24:31,295 --> 00:24:39,070
Scott: If I only had to choose between Microsoft, Google, Apple, I guess Facebook doesn't give out email.

381
00:24:39,991 --> 00:24:43,706
Rym: In that situation, I guess I might go with Microsoft.

382
00:24:43,746 --> 00:24:44,790
Rym: if I didn't go with Gmail.

383
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:46,694
Scott: I would choose the Apple one.

384
00:24:46,795 --> 00:24:51,150
Scott: Of those three choices, I would choose the Apple with if I didn't have any existing anything.

385
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,489
Scott: The Apple one is the easy choice for sure.

386
00:24:54,091 --> 00:24:55,890
Rym: Of course, I didn't have an iPhone until recently.

387
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,429
Scott: I'm just you know, even if I had no devices at all.

388
00:24:59,891 --> 00:25:00,152
Scott: Right.

389
00:25:00,212 --> 00:25:03,762
Scott: Just choosing only the email app and not any.

390
00:25:03,983 --> 00:25:06,290
Scott: nothing else is set yet with the Apple one.

391
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:08,566
Rym: But I got to say, good lord.

392
00:25:10,111 --> 00:25:24,970
Rym: Now that not that Covid is winding down, but as I've interacted with humans again a little more frequently, I am reminded that outside of my close circles, if you ask someone how you can get in touch with them, I have found that a lot of people don't actually have a good answer anymore.

393
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:32,610
Rym: Like non-online people aren't really sure and they'll mumble something about Facebook or maybe they have a cell phone number.

394
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,184
Rym: They'll give you a text and that's about it.

395
00:25:35,731 --> 00:25:38,910
Scott: Yeah, because like they're really only, you know, communicating frequently.

396
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:43,710
Scott: You know, they don't have an online presence where they're communicating with lots of people.

397
00:25:44,271 --> 00:25:45,177
Scott: It's like they only.

398
00:25:45,237 --> 00:25:47,390
Scott: it's like how did they communicate with their family?

399
00:25:48,191 --> 00:25:51,570
Scott: Maybe they are one of those Apple only families that all FaceTimes each other.

400
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:52,990
Scott: But it's like, how do I get in touch with you?

401
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,689
Scott: Well, they're not going to give you their fucking FaceTime.

402
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:57,177
Scott: That's not how it's going to.

403
00:25:57,197 --> 00:25:57,861
Scott: you're not going to.

404
00:25:57,881 --> 00:25:59,210
Scott: you just have to send them a quick message.

405
00:26:00,273 --> 00:26:03,530
Scott: They don't have a personal email that they're checking right constantly.

406
00:26:03,692 --> 00:26:05,030
Scott: They're not an online person.

407
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:08,670
Rym: I mean, I give people my direct Discord, but a lot of people don't.

408
00:26:09,311 --> 00:26:11,409
Rym: Discord is terrifying and confusing to them.

409
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:14,529
Scott: Yeah, they're not going to make and they have to make an account for it.

410
00:26:15,131 --> 00:26:18,910
Scott: Which they're not going to do just to talk to one person.

411
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,637
Rym: I would advise everyone.

412
00:26:21,657 --> 00:26:24,690
Rym: as a total aside and related to the first news we talked about.

413
00:26:25,511 --> 00:26:29,210
Rym: I would suggest installing Signal and just setting it up even if you don't use it.

414
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:29,926
Rym: Signal is...

415
00:26:30,111 --> 00:26:30,515
Scott: I have it.

416
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:31,910
Scott: I have it set up and never use it.

417
00:26:32,051 --> 00:26:34,289
Rym: Yeah, if you set it up and never use it, it will.

418
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:39,410
Rym: If you message someone else who has Signal, then you'll have end to end encryption.

419
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,389
Rym: Like it's it's legit and it works.

420
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:44,029
Rym: And that might be useful depending on how things go.

421
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,660
Scott: I don't think that.

422
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,670
Scott: I don't think that works like that.

423
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,609
Scott: If you just use the iPhone messages app, it's not just going to be like...

424
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,389
Rym: I use the Signal app.

425
00:26:51,412 --> 00:26:53,269
Scott: Yeah, I use the iPhone messages app.

426
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:55,089
Rym: No, you got to use the Signal app or it doesn't do shit.

427
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:56,238
Scott: Yeah.

428
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,977
Scott: Well, that's that's that's not.

429
00:26:58,038 --> 00:26:59,929
Scott: and, you know, I installed it and I don't use it.

430
00:27:00,332 --> 00:27:02,530
Rym: No, see, I installed it and I actually do use it.

431
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:02,973
Rym: I use it.

432
00:27:03,215 --> 00:27:04,488
Rym: I replaced SMS with it.

433
00:27:05,892 --> 00:27:07,910
Scott: Yeah, iMessages is also end to end encrypted.

434
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:16,270
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

435
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:20,930
Rym: So I'm linked to a tweet because the tweet links to a video, but the tweet also gives some context.

436
00:27:21,534 --> 00:27:22,669
Rym: The video is in German.

437
00:27:23,571 --> 00:27:24,509
Rym: It won't matter that much.

438
00:27:25,113 --> 00:27:27,130
Rym: It doesn't actually matter what they're saying.

439
00:27:27,191 --> 00:27:29,350
Rym: It looks like there's subtitles in multiple languages.

440
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:39,490
Rym: But my thing of the day is a video where there is a 15th century bath house in Germany and it has been restored.

441
00:27:40,796 --> 00:27:42,249
Scott: So a late medieval bath house.

442
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:47,050
Rym: Yeah, it has been restored and renovated to be fully functional and period correct.

443
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:49,410
Rym: And it's a museum.

444
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:54,910
Rym: And this video is two naked German guys taking you through the full experience.

445
00:27:55,790 --> 00:28:02,410
Rym: And I got to tell you, bath houses are something super cool that I wish Americans respected more.

446
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:06,387
Rym: And I wish we had destroyed all of them at the end of the 20s and 30s.

447
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:09,573
Scott: All right.

448
00:28:09,593 --> 00:28:13,850
Scott: So I think we've done an episode on sound cards a long time ago, but for people who aren't aware.

449
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:14,711
Scott: Right.

450
00:28:14,731 --> 00:28:18,049
Scott: You know, computers originally all the only sound they had was beep beep.

451
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:18,531
Scott: Right.

452
00:28:18,692 --> 00:28:22,490
Scott: And then, you know, the motherboard didn't have any sound audio facilities on it.

453
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:27,470
Scott: You had to put a card in your computer that had synthesizers and other sorts of audio chips on it.

454
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,260
Rym: You probably got an ad lib card.

455
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,970
Rym: Maybe you got a sound blaster.

456
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:32,733
Scott: And so, you know, right.

457
00:28:32,773 --> 00:28:40,070
Scott: So some, you know, when it comes to playing record, fully recorded audio samples like MP3s, WAV files, anything like that.

458
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:47,890
Scott: It doesn't really matter what sound card it is because you have the exact wave that is going to be played is recorded and then played.

459
00:28:48,010 --> 00:29:05,430
Scott: But the earliest computers and consoles could not do that because the amount of memory it would take to store a high fidelity audio sample of any length before we invented MP3s and processors fast enough to decompress them quickly, you know, was vast.

460
00:29:05,591 --> 00:29:08,162
Scott: And you didn't have a lot of storage space in early computers.

461
00:29:08,222 --> 00:29:09,910
Scott: And so that didn't work out.

462
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:30,130
Scott: So what you do is put a synthesizer in your computer and then it took a very little space to just basically have the equivalent of digital sheet music or even just, you know, a program that would generate, you know, sheet music effectively in, you know, as it processed to instruct the synthesizer.

463
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:33,399
Scott: Basically, it's like a keyboard without any keys.

464
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:37,169
Scott: And there's a processor that pushes the keys electronically.

465
00:29:37,771 --> 00:29:38,473
Scott: Right.

466
00:29:39,014 --> 00:29:43,909
Scott: And because of that, every computer and every sound card sounded differently.

467
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:44,250
Scott: Right.

468
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,257
Scott: The Commodore 64 sounded great.

469
00:29:46,699 --> 00:29:49,149
Scott: You know, some old Apple computers could really just go.

470
00:29:51,653 --> 00:30:06,670
Scott: You know, but there are people with nostalgia and there are people with preservation interests and people with, you know, various reasons would want to have, you know, those exact or as close enough to it.

471
00:30:07,151 --> 00:30:15,350
Scott: The exact synthesizers that were in those old sound cards so that they could, you know, use old software and hear exactly what it sounded like back in the day.

472
00:30:16,171 --> 00:30:18,215
Scott: Create music that is retro.

473
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:22,623
Scott: So many reasons that you would want an old sound card and old sound cards.

474
00:30:23,043 --> 00:30:25,047
Scott: Not necessarily easy to acquire.

475
00:30:25,107 --> 00:30:26,650
Scott: There just might not be a lot of them.

476
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,434
Scott: They might not be a lot of them that work.

477
00:30:28,814 --> 00:30:29,075
Scott: Right.

478
00:30:29,416 --> 00:30:29,957
Scott: They might not.

479
00:30:30,077 --> 00:30:35,550
Scott: Even if you buy a Sound Blaster 16 and you find one that inbox mint inbox.

480
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:36,172
Scott: Guess what?

481
00:30:36,533 --> 00:30:40,950
Scott: That shits an ISA card and your computer does not have an ISA slot.

482
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:43,129
Rym: Your computer doesn't even have a PCI slot.

483
00:30:43,951 --> 00:30:44,171
Scott: Right.

484
00:30:44,212 --> 00:30:45,153
Scott: So, yeah.

485
00:30:45,273 --> 00:30:48,058
Scott: So it's like, well, how are you going to hook that up to your computer?

486
00:30:48,118 --> 00:30:54,889
Scott: You probably could find a way, some sort of adapter, some and write a bunch of drivers or get an old computer also.

487
00:30:54,949 --> 00:30:55,690
Scott: But that sucks.

488
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:06,807
Scott: So here we have somebody who in 2019 compiled this forum post, the comprehensive list of all modern reproductions of vintage sound cards.

489
00:31:07,388 --> 00:31:08,570
Scott: And it's exactly what it is.

490
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:12,497
Scott: It's a comprehensive list of modern reproductions of classic sound cards.

491
00:31:13,178 --> 00:31:16,344
Scott: And they've updated this list as recently as May 2022.

492
00:31:16,344 --> 00:31:18,428
Scott: So just, you know, last month.

493
00:31:20,431 --> 00:31:22,516
Scott: So they just been updating this forum post.

494
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:26,888
Scott: And it's like, yep, you can get some creative music system, Yamaha, YMF262.

495
00:31:29,091 --> 00:31:29,392
Scott: Right.

496
00:31:29,713 --> 00:31:39,171
Rym: Sound Blaster's crystal, whatever is all kinds of different, terrifying urge to spin up the old Sound Blaster all 32.

497
00:31:39,171 --> 00:31:39,371
Scott: Right.

498
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:44,560
Scott: But, you know, here are, you know, some of these are actually people who have produced boards for sale.

499
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:50,950
Scott: Some of them are plans for boards that you can like put together yourself, all sorts of things here.

500
00:31:51,070 --> 00:32:01,050
Scott: But if you're interested in, you know, replicating the sounds of old computers with new computers, this is the link for you to click on.

501
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,878
Rym: In the moment, the GeekNights Book Club book, Nine Fox Gambit.

502
00:32:04,898 --> 00:32:05,560
Rym: We're done with it.

503
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,290
Rym: The only reason we didn't do a show on Thursday is because we were busy.

504
00:32:09,931 --> 00:32:11,734
Rym: So and I think we're going to be busy on Wednesday.

505
00:32:11,754 --> 00:32:12,937
Rym: So no show on Wednesday this week.

506
00:32:12,977 --> 00:32:18,188
Rym: But next week on Thursday, even recorded in advance, that will be the Nine Fox Gambit show.

507
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:18,950
Rym: We're done with the book.

508
00:32:20,354 --> 00:32:23,201
Scott: That'll be the last show before I have to start another job.

509
00:32:23,221 --> 00:32:26,470
Scott: Unless they decide to unhire me before I start.

510
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:27,751
Rym: Exciting times.

511
00:32:28,372 --> 00:32:29,314
Rym: Legitimately exciting.

512
00:32:29,454 --> 00:32:31,698
Rym: But Nine Fox Gambit's real good.

513
00:32:31,718 --> 00:32:33,020
Rym: I got a lot to say about it.

514
00:32:33,621 --> 00:32:38,890
Rym: And we're not going to talk about the second book in that book club book episode.

515
00:32:39,371 --> 00:32:44,641
Rym: But I will say that having read most of the second book in the series, I'm going to finish the series.

516
00:32:44,741 --> 00:32:46,545
Rym: I mean, granted, I think you always finish the series.

517
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:49,190
Rym: I was about to say, I don't think that was your Rym series finisher.

518
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:50,091
Rym: The cost.

519
00:32:50,111 --> 00:32:55,400
Rym: I was about to say, Scott was probably going to point out that with one exception, I've never not finished a series.

520
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,182
Rym: I fucking read all four.

521
00:32:56,282 --> 00:33:01,010
Scott: Every single time I've made a book club selection, that was the first book of a series.

522
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:05,557
Scott: Rym has gone on to finish that series and I have usually not done so.

523
00:33:05,737 --> 00:33:09,283
Rym: Wheel of Time, you followed a little further than I expected.

524
00:33:09,544 --> 00:33:12,669
Scott: I read, I don't know, it might have been four or five wheels of time.

525
00:33:12,709 --> 00:33:13,430
Scott: I don't know how many.

526
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:14,791
Scott: There's at least a few.

527
00:33:15,152 --> 00:33:17,957
Rym: Meanwhile, a month later, I was like, hey, I'm on book 13.

528
00:33:17,957 --> 00:33:18,758
Rym: And you were like, what?

529
00:33:19,018 --> 00:33:21,542
Scott: I've read every published Prince of Nothing book.

530
00:33:21,883 --> 00:33:22,143
Rym: Yep.

531
00:33:22,344 --> 00:33:26,190
Rym: And I doubt there'll be any more, which I highly doubt there'll ever be any more.

532
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:29,113
Rym: Little troublesome because I would like to know.

533
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:29,894
Rym: But anyway.

534
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:31,195
Scott: Anyway.

535
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,298
Rym: But I'm enjoying the Nine Fox Gambit.

536
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:35,561
Rym: By Thursday, I got to pick what the next book club book is.

537
00:33:35,581 --> 00:33:36,762
Rym: I got a few ideas.

538
00:33:38,144 --> 00:33:42,690
Rym: As much as I want to pick it, I'm not going to pick Emily Wilson's newer translation of a different work.

539
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:45,853
Scott: Because, well, I mean, yeah, it's like, you know, that's.

540
00:33:45,993 --> 00:33:47,095
Scott: I'm going to read that for sure.

541
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:48,236
Rym: Yeah, I'm going to read that.

542
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:54,923
Scott: The point is, is like, stop just picking sequels and things related to existing book club books.

543
00:33:55,203 --> 00:33:57,025
Scott: You know, it would be preferable to get variety.

544
00:33:57,085 --> 00:33:57,245
Scott: Right.

545
00:33:57,305 --> 00:34:01,610
Scott: If every book club book was something, you know, going down a new road and not rehashing an old road.

546
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:06,755
Rym: I will resist the urge, at least for one more cycle, to pick a nonfiction book, though.

547
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:08,235
Rym: But I'm going to warn you now.

548
00:34:08,857 --> 00:34:13,481
Rym: My next book club book after this one will very likely be nonfiction.

549
00:34:15,443 --> 00:34:17,585
Rym: I love me some nonfiction.

550
00:34:19,987 --> 00:34:21,909
Rym: Don't worry, this will be fiction and maybe pulp.

551
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:22,489
Rym: Well, I'm thinking.

552
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,351
Scott: I'll just I'll just pick some computer book.

553
00:34:24,371 --> 00:34:25,371
Scott: That's not fiction, right?

554
00:34:25,853 --> 00:34:31,056
Rym: I mean, you could just read anything you pick.

555
00:34:31,217 --> 00:34:39,063
Rym: Just gives me the opportunity if I so be if I feel that it is justified to bust out my favorite count, the count.

556
00:34:39,223 --> 00:34:43,427
Scott: It's like, can I can I take structure and interpretation of computer programs as a book club book?

557
00:34:43,746 --> 00:34:46,589
Rym: I mean, if you do count of Monte Cristo is going to be the next book club book.

558
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:47,550
Rym: And that book.

559
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:47,989
Rym: I don't know.

560
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:50,831
Scott: I don't know if you would understand what.

561
00:34:50,891 --> 00:34:56,056
Scott: the art of programming by Newt this book.

562
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:57,036
Scott: Is that even going to work?

563
00:34:57,557 --> 00:35:00,339
Rym: If you pick that, what you know what?

564
00:35:00,479 --> 00:35:05,302
Rym: I could do some technical like Newton, NATO doctrine book or some bullshit.

565
00:35:05,322 --> 00:35:06,563
Rym: The stuff that I read for fun.

566
00:35:07,604 --> 00:35:09,265
Rym: I'm not saying you wouldn't understand it.

567
00:35:09,345 --> 00:35:10,406
Rym: I just don't think you'd like it.

568
00:35:11,086 --> 00:35:11,546
Scott: I'll be.

569
00:35:11,566 --> 00:35:15,749
Scott: you know, just, you know, if you want to humor me, I guess I'll just ask you to do this.

570
00:35:15,809 --> 00:35:16,850
Scott: I can't make that right.

571
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:18,391
Scott: But go S.I.C.P.

572
00:35:18,411 --> 00:35:19,432
Scott: You can just read it for free.

573
00:35:20,032 --> 00:35:21,213
Rym: I wrote it before.

574
00:35:21,973 --> 00:35:23,515
Scott: Go try to read the first chapter.

575
00:35:25,236 --> 00:35:27,077
Scott: It's doubt it'll end with some.

576
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:28,138
Scott: it's a textbook.

577
00:35:28,318 --> 00:35:31,520
Scott: So it'll end with some quiz questions, I guess, in the first chapter.

578
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:31,980
Scott: Yeah.

579
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:35,263
Scott: And just see if you can even understand what the fuck is going on.

580
00:35:35,363 --> 00:35:41,787
Rym: It's tough because I am a computer professional and a technologist, but I am an information technologist.

581
00:35:41,987 --> 00:35:43,868
Rym: I am not a computer scientist.

582
00:35:44,629 --> 00:35:44,889
Scott: Yeah.

583
00:35:45,189 --> 00:35:45,469
Scott: Anyway.

584
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:46,210
Rym: Yeah.

585
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:52,215
Rym: Otherwise, Pax West, there will very, very likely be at least one gig nights panel there.

586
00:35:52,615 --> 00:35:55,177
Rym: But the odds are it'll be either just me or just me and Emily.

587
00:35:55,497 --> 00:35:58,500
Rym: Emily will be there for some other professional reasons.

588
00:35:59,981 --> 00:36:03,824
Rym: I can't say that we'll be at any specific cons beyond that.

589
00:36:03,965 --> 00:36:10,350
Rym: I feel like Scott and I might do a panel together at Pax Unplugged, even if we don't want Pax Unplugged to happen.

590
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:10,610
Scott: Right.

591
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:15,815
Scott: We've reached the point where where I was just like, you know, yeah, cons are going to happen or not.

592
00:36:15,895 --> 00:36:17,216
Scott: And the answer was not.

593
00:36:17,316 --> 00:36:23,622
Scott: But yeah, now we're at the point where it's like, listen, you know, I don't know if I'm going to go to Pax Unplugged.

594
00:36:23,702 --> 00:36:32,250
Rym: I'll say this of all the Pax's Pax Unplugged requires the least advanced decision from me and Scott to decide if we're going to go.

595
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:33,953
Rym: It's the least planning.

596
00:36:34,273 --> 00:36:37,399
Rym: It can be a day trip very easily like that's a short trip.

597
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,280
Rym: There's a lot.

598
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:43,690
Rym: it's a lot easier to plan a Pax Unplugged to the last second for us than literally any other Pax.

599
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:44,630
Scott: Right.

600
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:48,959
Scott: But, you know, we're at the point where it's like, I really would like to go to Pax Unplugged.

601
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,747
Scott: You know, I hope other people I know would go there to play games with.

602
00:36:52,848 --> 00:36:54,010
Scott: But who knows what's going to happen.

603
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:54,551
Rym: Yep.

604
00:36:54,691 --> 00:37:00,137
Rym: But I can at least say that I will almost definitely be presenting at least one panel at Pax West.

605
00:37:00,437 --> 00:37:12,050
Rym: But I cannot promise that you will see me at the con at any other point than the panels, because I'll be in Seattle for other reasons and probably not hanging out mostly alone in the convention center for four days.

606
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:16,154
Scott: The website is coming along very nicely.

607
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:24,930
Scott: I'm just about done with the part of the website that you won't see, which is the tooling that will let Rym upload episodes easily and completely.

608
00:37:25,751 --> 00:37:28,818
Scott: It took a long time because I was getting really fancy in terms of the.

609
00:37:29,059 --> 00:37:33,770
Scott: I discussed this before we sorted out the ID three chapters and all kinds of other fancy features.

610
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:37,215
Scott: So that seems to actually all be coming together.

611
00:37:37,235 --> 00:37:45,670
Scott: The next part I have to work on is basically getting all the data from the old website over to the new website with some sort of ETL process.

612
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:58,990
Scott: And once that's in place, the the finish line isn't close, but the the the the first finish line, I guess, of take down the old website and put up the new website becomes pretty close.

613
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:04,224
Scott: Only, you know, a small pile of small tasks to accomplish to make that happen.

614
00:38:04,264 --> 00:38:06,170
Scott: You know, verifying all the redirects are correct.

615
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:21,630
Rym: I don't want to take a moment to highlight and praise Scott here, because gig nights as a philosophy from the beginning, one thing that we were both like really, really mad about is when links break and people don't follow the basic contract of the Internet.

616
00:38:22,171 --> 00:38:29,630
Rym: And this would all be a lot easier if we didn't insist on never breaking a URL and never taking down content we have published.

617
00:38:30,732 --> 00:38:35,149
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you got to realize, like the GeekNights website was at first a WordPress, I think.

618
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:35,870
Scott: Yeah.

619
00:38:36,431 --> 00:38:41,961
Scott: And so if you have some link to some old WordPress posting, it's like it's.

620
00:38:42,141 --> 00:38:43,724
Scott: I believe it would still work now.

621
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:46,549
Scott: And I'm going to make sure it continues to still work and redirect to.

622
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:50,275
Scott: Yeah, you know, it's like never mind the cruft of.

623
00:38:50,756 --> 00:38:54,422
Rym: we were using the advanced features of Libsyn when Libsyn launched.

624
00:38:54,662 --> 00:38:56,646
Rym: Those features are no longer the advanced features.

625
00:38:56,906 --> 00:38:59,330
Rym: They are charitably called the legacy features.

626
00:39:00,032 --> 00:39:00,414
Scott: Right.

627
00:39:00,957 --> 00:39:03,150
Rym: I think we are literally their oldest customer.

628
00:39:04,311 --> 00:39:05,734
Scott: It's quite possible we could be.

629
00:39:06,736 --> 00:39:13,490
Scott: But yeah, so, you know, sorting out all that shit will replace the old website with the new one as soon as the new one achieves feature parity.

630
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:28,310
Scott: And then at that point, the website, the new website will be open source on GitHub and you will be able to watch the progress and also submit, you know, if you want to help out, if you have the skills to do so.

631
00:39:28,631 --> 00:39:33,490
Rym: And, you know, if you're trying to start a podcast, guess what will be a really cool framework you could use?

632
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:39,330
Scott: Yeah, it might be difficult to just copy the website and deploy it yourself.

633
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:43,008
Rym: Because it is it is made for the kind of thing that we do.

634
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:44,451
Scott: Yeah.

635
00:39:44,711 --> 00:39:54,570
Scott: You know, but regardless, you know, the progress has been happening, especially since I haven't had any work to do, but I haven't done any work on it in, say, three or four days because I've been doing other stuff.

636
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,017
Scott: But I'm going to, you know, this week.

637
00:39:56,097 --> 00:39:58,750
Scott: there's going to be some more progress happening, you know, tomorrow.

638
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:11,410
Rym: And the thing is, once the new website is live, that lights a fire under both of us for a lot of the like new kinds of content and experimental stuff and like other projects we want to do.

639
00:40:12,632 --> 00:40:15,710
Scott: So there's already a long list of features to be added to the website.

640
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:19,810
Scott: So we got to work on those also, but prioritize them and whatnot.

641
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:20,291
Scott: Yep.

642
00:40:21,573 --> 00:40:29,810
Rym: So, yeah, let's just get right into it with a show that we came up with because our friends are currently arguing about the nature of refrigerators for a bunch of reasons.

643
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:31,272
Rym: So I realize we've.

644
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:33,057
Rym: we have talked about cooling PCs.

645
00:40:33,337 --> 00:40:34,861
Rym: We've also talked about PC cooling.

646
00:40:35,543 --> 00:40:38,110
Rym: One of the rare instances where I think I snuck in an episode twice.

647
00:40:38,911 --> 00:40:40,176
Rym: We've talked about server rooms.

648
00:40:40,276 --> 00:40:41,300
Rym: We've talked about HVAC.

649
00:40:41,862 --> 00:40:43,449
Rym: Never talked about refrigeration.

650
00:40:45,093 --> 00:40:47,168
Rym: Like as a technology, arguably.

651
00:40:47,631 --> 00:40:52,041
Scott: I mean, we don't need to explain how refrigeration works with compressors and whatnot.

652
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:52,282
Scott: Right.

653
00:40:52,322 --> 00:40:55,630
Scott: You can look that up on YouTube and find better visualizations of it.

654
00:40:55,790 --> 00:41:00,490
Scott: I think even Rym's favorite technology guy, whatever, has a video or two on it also.

655
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:05,290
Rym: Suffice it to say, the only thing you need to know if you don't know is that all refrigeration is a concept.

656
00:41:06,071 --> 00:41:07,935
Rym: It does one of two things and that's it.

657
00:41:07,995 --> 00:41:15,090
Rym: It either removes heat from an environment into a medium in some fashion, like, say, dry ice in a room.

658
00:41:15,471 --> 00:41:25,110
Rym: It's pulling heat into something to cool the space or it is actively pumping heat out of a space into the broader environment.

659
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:26,394
Rym: It's just a heat pump.

660
00:41:26,755 --> 00:41:27,719
Rym: You Google for heat pump.

661
00:41:28,061 --> 00:41:30,210
Rym: There are plenty of people, like Scott said, who will explain it to you.

662
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:32,254
Scott: So there's many different methods.

663
00:41:32,395 --> 00:41:37,590
Scott: There's many different methods of doing this that vary sometimes in big ways, sometimes in small ways.

664
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:40,669
Scott: But, you know, regardless, like that's what you're doing.

665
00:41:41,451 --> 00:41:52,850
Rym: Less than 200 years ago, the primary way a lot of people in America got things like ice was harvesting it from rivers in the winter and storing it under, like, bales of hay.

666
00:41:54,332 --> 00:41:54,514
Scott: Yup.

667
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:56,169
Scott: I didn't even know where the hell they got dry ice.

668
00:41:59,371 --> 00:42:03,101
Rym: I'm trying to think about, I know about methods from the 1900s to make dry ice.

669
00:42:03,201 --> 00:42:06,770
Rym: I don't know if and how dry ice might have been made before that, actually.

670
00:42:07,152 --> 00:42:10,209
Rym: I don't know the history of dry ice at all, I realize, other than that one thing.

671
00:42:10,289 --> 00:42:10,470
Rym: Anyway.

672
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:22,730
Scott: I do remember, though, my grandfather talking about how back in the day, it's like you look at today and people drive food around and other things that need to be cold in refrigerated trucks.

673
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:31,370
Scott: Just a big truck that has a refrigerator attached to it and the inside of the truck is cold and now you can drive meat around town in the summer.

674
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:31,711
Scott: Right.

675
00:42:32,232 --> 00:42:40,690
Scott: But he said back in the day, all they would do is just have a truck and throw a piece of dry ice in the truck and maybe put a fan near it.

676
00:42:41,832 --> 00:42:42,476
Scott: And that was it.

677
00:42:42,597 --> 00:42:44,568
Scott: And the truck would be cold as hell.

678
00:42:45,251 --> 00:42:45,531
Rym: Yup.

679
00:42:46,013 --> 00:42:46,474
Rym: All right.

680
00:42:46,495 --> 00:42:46,735
Rym: Yes.

681
00:42:46,816 --> 00:42:50,407
Rym: Dry ice was observed and documented in detail in the 1830s.

682
00:42:52,391 --> 00:42:59,430
Rym: And it looks like in the early 1900s is when manufacturing processes that are not that different from what we do today were invented.

683
00:43:00,214 --> 00:43:02,930
Scott: And Rym has read Wikipedia to you as a service.

684
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:04,533
Rym: Yup, because I was curious.

685
00:43:04,814 --> 00:43:10,690
Rym: I did not know if they were able to make dry ice in the late 1800s and the answer seems to be sort of.

686
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:12,111
Scott: Okay.

687
00:43:13,052 --> 00:43:29,050
Scott: Regardless, all the ways of keeping things cold back in the day, meaning up until relatively recently in terms of human history, was get cold shit and put it near the shit that needs to be cold until it runs out and then get more cold shit.

688
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:30,735
Scott: Even in the 20th century, right?

689
00:43:30,755 --> 00:43:32,019
Scott: You had the icebox, right?

690
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:33,383
Scott: They didn't have refrigerators in houses.

691
00:43:33,583 --> 00:43:35,910
Scott: You would have someone deliver fucking ice to your house.

692
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:39,899
Scott: You'd put the ice into the bottom of the fridge, right?

693
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:43,750
Scott: The fridge would be cold until the ice melted and then they would deliver more ice.

694
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:46,849
Scott: And that's how you kept food in your house from spoiling.

695
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:58,868
Rym: So, my grandparents had, when I was a kid, I might have talked about this on GeekNights more than a decade ago, they had a general electric refrigerator from the late 1940s.

696
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:01,856
Rym: And it wasn't their primary fridge.

697
00:44:01,896 --> 00:44:04,288
Rym: They had a more recent fridge in the main house.

698
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:11,264
Rym: But in the furnace room, they had that old late 40s fridge and it still worked.

699
00:44:11,625 --> 00:44:13,610
Rym: And they were still using it because they thought it was neat.

700
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,578
Rym: It never had any maintenance other than some lubrication at any point.

701
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,905
Rym: And as a kid, I was vaguely obsessed with it.

702
00:44:19,185 --> 00:44:20,830
Rym: And all they stored in there was soda pop.

703
00:44:22,411 --> 00:44:25,569
Rym: It had this really cool chunky latching mechanism to open it.

704
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:27,749
Scott: Yep, that's how they do.

705
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:29,654
Rym: Yep, and you had to manually defrost it.

706
00:44:29,734 --> 00:44:35,770
Rym: But yeah, so early refrigerators that plugged into an outlet and used electricity, like my grandparents...

707
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:38,896
Scott: Hold on, there's one thing for the ice boxes, right?

708
00:44:38,916 --> 00:44:45,430
Scott: There's one thing about the ice box that I never knew and still don't know, but I only have a guess.

709
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:48,844
Scott: Which is that, you know, the ice cube would melt, the big ice cube, right?

710
00:44:49,125 --> 00:44:50,010
Scott: Then they'd bring a new one.

711
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:53,416
Scott: Did you just drain the water down the drain?

712
00:44:54,098 --> 00:44:55,121
Scott: Or drink the water?

713
00:44:55,663 --> 00:44:57,448
Scott: Because the old ice cube melted into water.

714
00:44:57,468 --> 00:44:58,090
Scott: It didn't disappear.

715
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:00,173
Scott: What did they do?

716
00:45:00,193 --> 00:45:00,997
Scott: Did they pump it out?

717
00:45:01,641 --> 00:45:03,310
Scott: What did they do with the water from the old ice cube?

718
00:45:04,072 --> 00:45:12,650
Rym: So the Wikipedia page doesn't actually say much about it, except it talks a lot about how all nice ice chests had spigots to drain it and catch pans and holding tanks.

719
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:15,850
Scott: Okay, so you would drain it and it would go down the drain into the sewer?

720
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:17,379
Rym: Yeah, pretty much.

721
00:45:17,621 --> 00:45:18,489
Rym: I doubt people...

722
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:19,690
Scott: Like down the sink, basically?

723
00:45:20,291 --> 00:45:22,008
Rym: Unless you lived somewhere where... That was my guess.

724
00:45:22,651 --> 00:45:30,190
Rym: If you lived somewhere where you didn't have running water in your house, which, frankly, in the early 1900s in the US, not that uncommon.

725
00:45:30,773 --> 00:45:34,750
Scott: But if you lived in a place without running water, are you really going to be in range of an ice delivery man?

726
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:35,631
Rym: Might have.

727
00:45:36,013 --> 00:45:36,474
Rym: Small town.

728
00:45:36,976 --> 00:45:40,129
Rym: A lot of houses in the 20s did not have...

729
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:44,870
Scott: Since it's just water, it is safe to just drain it out into the backyard or some shit, right?

730
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:44,996
Scott: Yeah.

731
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:47,570
Scott: As long as you don't drain it on your kitchen floor.

732
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:54,388
Rym: But we had a beefy dehumidifier in the basement when I was a kid, and we would actually take that water and use it to water the plants in the house.

733
00:45:54,468 --> 00:45:55,090
Rym: Just, why not?

734
00:45:55,992 --> 00:45:56,609
Scott: Yeah, why not?

735
00:45:57,211 --> 00:45:58,272
Rym: But yeah, refrigeration.

736
00:45:58,412 --> 00:46:16,430
Rym: I talk about this a lot on GeekNights, but in general, one of the most important things you can do if you care about technology is not to just focus on the bleeding edge of the cool new stuff we can do, but to think about technology that works and how it can be distributed more equitably, used more efficiently, etc.

737
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:21,530
Rym: Refrigeration is one of the most important things humans have ever invented.

738
00:46:22,111 --> 00:46:25,660
Scott: Yeah, if you play Civilization, it gets a whole spot on the tech tree.

739
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:30,010
Scott: I think in every Civilization game that I'm aware of, refrigeration has its own item.

740
00:46:30,451 --> 00:46:32,185
Rym: It's like, "Oh yeah, double food from all your shit

741
00:46:32,226 --> 00:46:32,407
Rym: now!".

742
00:46:33,433 --> 00:46:33,970
Scott: Yup, exactly.

743
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:35,499
Rym: Your cities can just grow like crazy.

744
00:46:36,163 --> 00:46:37,230
Rym: See, also, sewers.

745
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:38,541
Scott: Yup.

746
00:46:39,451 --> 00:46:39,836
Rym: Hospitals.

747
00:46:39,856 --> 00:46:41,010
Rym: that comes after hospitals.

748
00:46:43,276 --> 00:46:48,570
Scott: After plumbing, I think refrigeration is the next most important invention for human society.

749
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:49,051
Rym: Yup.

750
00:46:49,494 --> 00:46:50,724
Rym: I mean, it's to the point to where...

751
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:55,288
Scott: It's dependent on electricity, which at least kind of, right?

752
00:46:55,348 --> 00:46:55,690
Scott: Mostly.

753
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:59,329
Scott: There are plenty... So I guess you could rank electricity higher, kind of.

754
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:09,210
Rym: But there are plenty of cooling mechanisms that are as effective as modern day refrigeration that uses electricity that do not require electricity.

755
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:09,990
Rym: There's lots of ways to do it.

756
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:15,170
Scott: That is true, but the vast majority of refrigeration around the world is the electric kind.

757
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:15,751
Scott: Yup.

758
00:47:16,192 --> 00:47:23,310
Rym: But I think the most important thing about it is just that it allowed perishable food to be stored with relative safety.

759
00:47:24,364 --> 00:47:24,509
Scott: Yup.

760
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:26,013
Rym: Like, beyond everything else.

761
00:47:26,554 --> 00:47:42,030
Rym: Because even in a modern world, in the year 2022, where I have a refrigerator and a freezer, I still have to put a not insignificant amount of mental effort into thinking about the safety of various foods and what should be stored where.

762
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:43,735
Rym: And can this be frozen?

763
00:47:43,795 --> 00:47:44,939
Rym: Can this be refrigerated?

764
00:47:45,019 --> 00:47:46,122
Rym: Should this be refrigerated?

765
00:47:46,443 --> 00:47:48,830
Rym: Some foods shouldn't be refrigerated, like tomatoes!

766
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:50,973
Scott: But I mean, think about this.

767
00:47:51,053 --> 00:47:53,179
Scott: Back in the day, before refrigeration, right?

768
00:47:53,259 --> 00:47:56,328
Scott: It's like, okay, you either had to get everything fresh, or, right?

769
00:47:57,411 --> 00:48:05,778
Scott: You store some food, okay, well then what if, you know, you might have to like... I mean, any food you want to store, you don't have to do some sort of preservation work, right?

770
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:12,310
Scott: Like, you know, maybe can it, or, you know, what's it called?

771
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:16,890
Scott: Like, you know, you can't just save the beef for tomorrow, you gotta make some beef jerky instead, right?

772
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:18,107
Scott: It's like, you know, stuff like that.

773
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:21,477
Rym: Like, leftovers were difficult.

774
00:48:21,638 --> 00:48:24,150
Rym: Leftovers like we know them today are basically impossible without refrigeration.

775
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:29,200
Scott: Right, it's like, okay, then you get, it's like, okay, you have this sort of battle going on.

776
00:48:29,261 --> 00:48:30,724
Scott: It's like, do I save food?

777
00:48:30,744 --> 00:48:33,790
Scott: Do I eat food, more food than I can stomach?

778
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:35,393
Scott: Do I go hungry?

779
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:41,126
Scott: You know, do I eat, do I, the food's older, but do I eat it anyway and risk getting sick?

780
00:48:41,226 --> 00:48:43,050
Scott: Do I even know that the food will make me sick?

781
00:48:43,972 --> 00:48:45,409
Scott: Just have warm meat lying around.

782
00:48:45,890 --> 00:49:02,570
Rym: Yup, and while there are a bunch of adjacent technologies that have achieved similar results, like to keep things cool, like evaporative coolers, like those have existed since ancient times, they are much less reliable, and they're not as controllable.

783
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:08,770
Rym: The big thing about the refrigeration we're talking about, like a modern fridge, is that you pick a temperature, and it is at that temperature.

784
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:17,610
Scott: Also, you know, you talk about, you know, food traveling, right, so it's like you'd have to eat food that came from somewhere close.

785
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:28,150
Scott: You couldn't eat a food that, you know, wouldn't, a spoilable food, that came from far away, you know, like, you get a fruit from another country, it's like you couldn't have that.

786
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:31,798
Scott: It would be disgusting by the time it took a boat over, or even if it took a plane.

787
00:49:31,858 --> 00:49:37,110
Scott: somehow, you know, I guess planes and refrigerators were invented around, you know.

788
00:49:38,531 --> 00:49:43,270
Scott: But, you know, it's like before the, you know, you'd have to take a boat, and it's like it would be rotten.

789
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:50,590
Scott: It's like you would never be able to eat that unless you went to the other place, then you could eat the food from there, but you couldn't have brought the food from home, right?

790
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:53,070
Scott: It would be disgusting by the time you got to the other side, right?

791
00:49:54,410 --> 00:50:05,250
Scott: It's like, you know, on boats, it's like the navies would be bringing around live animals on the boat, because otherwise, it's like if you just had all the animals pre-butchered, it's like guess what, you're not going to make it across the ocean.

792
00:50:05,671 --> 00:50:05,972
Rym: Yup.

793
00:50:06,092 --> 00:50:12,209
Rym: Similarly, most of the food they brought was all the food you imagine on a Napoleonic era ship.

794
00:50:13,691 --> 00:50:14,114
Rym: Weevils.

795
00:50:14,234 --> 00:50:16,389
Rym: Weevils and hard bread and salt pork.

796
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:18,391
Scott: Exactly.

797
00:50:18,471 --> 00:50:21,376
Scott: So, yeah, refrigeration was huge.

798
00:50:22,158 --> 00:50:29,210
Scott: So, modern day, right, you go and you probably just buy a fucking refrigerator, but there's so many different ones now.

799
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:37,310
Scott: When I was a kid, everyone I knew just had the standard refrigerator, which was just freezer on top, fridge on the bottom.

800
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:40,414
Rym: When I was a kid, there were exactly two kinds of fridges.

801
00:50:40,815 --> 00:50:49,790
Rym: Everyone, with a handful of exceptions, had what you describe, and there were a handful of kids whose parents were rich, who lived in the nicer houses and the newer developments in the suburbs.

802
00:50:50,311 --> 00:51:00,090
Rym: They had the early versions of those modern fancy refrigerators with a bunch of features on them, like an ice thing and a water thing in the front, and the doors that opened to the sides.

803
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:04,003
Scott: I feel like I didn't see any of those until the mid to late 90s.

804
00:51:04,023 --> 00:51:06,090
Scott: They probably existed earlier, but I didn't see any.

805
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:14,990
Rym: I saw them in the houses of a handful of kids I knew in middle school, who were way richer than us and lived in way nicer suburbs than we did.

806
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:20,990
Scott: What I did see were people who had, you know, larger houses, they had garages and large basements.

807
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:29,950
Rym: Oh, we had a beverage fridge, we had a fridge in the kitchen, and we had a, basically, when we bought that new fridge, the old fridge wasn't that broken, it was just like old and inefficient.

808
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:32,470
Rym: We stuck it in the garage, and that became the soda fridge.

809
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:39,570
Scott: Yeah, we might have done that if we had had such a space, right, in our house, but we also didn't drink soda, so it wasn't really a thing.

810
00:51:40,371 --> 00:51:42,090
Scott: But people had chest freezers.

811
00:51:42,695 --> 00:51:44,510
Rym: We also had a chest freezer.

812
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:58,950
Scott: Yeah, so the people with the chest freezers, for example, right, I remember you'd buy your turkey on Thanksgiving, and you'd go to the person's house who had the chest freezer, and leave it in there until Thanksgiving.

813
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:01,110
Scott: Then you would go there the day before Thanksgiving.

814
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:03,550
Rym: If I had enough space for it, I would 100% have a chest freezer today.

815
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:05,850
Scott: Because we didn't have room in our regular fridge to store a whole fucking turkey.

816
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:09,690
Rym: I would absolutely have a chest freezer if there was anywhere to put it in this apartment.

817
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:11,169
Scott: Yeah.

818
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:26,450
Rym: There's also those cool, there are the Peltier, like there's chest freezers and chest refrigerators that are designed for long-term storage to be energy efficient, and they tend to have a really weak-sauce Peltier device instead of the more traditional cooling.

819
00:52:26,951 --> 00:52:33,350
Rym: And they basically take a long time to get cold, but if you don't open often, they just stay cold using almost no electricity.

820
00:52:34,071 --> 00:52:40,630
Scott: I mean, the best memory I had of chest freezers was the people across the street had one in the garage, and that's where they put the popsicles.

821
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:43,057
Scott: It was like, you didn't have to go in their house to go and get a popsicle.

822
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:45,124
Scott: You could just be like, "Bam, you're already outside having a good

823
00:52:45,144 --> 00:52:45,405
Scott: time.".

824
00:52:45,445 --> 00:52:46,770
Scott: Just like, boom, popsicle right there.

825
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:55,730
Rym: I remember going into random friends' parents' garages and just taking ice cream and popsicles out of their chest freezer, probably without permission, because the kids would all just kind of do this.

826
00:52:57,410 --> 00:53:00,950
Scott: It was equal opportunity, except for our house, because ours were in the freezer.

827
00:53:04,131 --> 00:53:14,130
Rym: Though, what I do, the thing that always did bother me is every fridge I've ever seen that has an external port for water and ice, that shit never works.

828
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:18,740
Scott: Okay, well, first of all, it works sometimes, right?

829
00:53:19,141 --> 00:53:22,810
Scott: The thing that bothers me is, A, inconsistent design.

830
00:53:23,251 --> 00:53:28,960
Scott: A lot of times, I try to use it, and the design of what I'm supposed to do is not obvious.

831
00:53:29,001 --> 00:53:34,330
Scott: Some of them, there's the plastic thing, you push your cup into it, and it's like, "Ah, that should make water come

832
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:34,490
Scott: out.".

833
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:37,538
Scott: And some of them, that makes the ice come out, and some of them makes the water come out.

834
00:53:37,578 --> 00:53:38,561
Scott: Some of them don't even have that.

835
00:53:39,022 --> 00:53:41,890
Scott: Some of them, you gotta push buttons on the face of the thing to make stuff happen.

836
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:47,670
Rym: A lot of times, they have a dial and a switch, and you set it to what you want to happen when the plastic thing gets hit.

837
00:53:48,151 --> 00:53:49,936
Scott: And there should only ever be two buttons.

838
00:53:50,257 --> 00:53:51,781
Scott: Spit out water and spit out ice.

839
00:53:51,821 --> 00:53:53,004
Scott: Some of these things have more buttons.

840
00:53:53,044 --> 00:53:54,327
Scott: What the fuck are those buttons for?

841
00:53:54,548 --> 00:53:55,390
Scott: Like, seriously?

842
00:53:55,970 --> 00:54:00,190
Rym: Crushed ice versus chopped ice, even though they end up being kind of the same on most of these things.

843
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:01,572
Scott: Yeah, I don't give a shit.

844
00:54:01,592 --> 00:54:03,675
Scott: If you give a shit about that, you got problems, right?

845
00:54:03,715 --> 00:54:13,090
Scott: And then, the other thing is, I guess if you're extra fancy, I imagine, I've never seen one, there must be one out there that will carbonate the water, right?

846
00:54:14,211 --> 00:54:21,090
Scott: Which I don't drink, but, you know, okay, if that's the case, I could make, you know, if you're that person, I could maybe say the third button is okay.

847
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:36,590
Rym: Well, I guess I'm always, I never like when a half-assed version of a feature is put into an inappropriate device, as opposed to, most people probably don't need this feature, and if people who really want or need it get a dedicated, specialized device to do that thing.

848
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:42,290
Rym: Like, if I were that guy, I would have a specialized ice maker, like, in my bar.

849
00:54:43,471 --> 00:54:50,690
Scott: Well, I mean, if you are in a place where, you know, let's say, you know, the water is not so drinkable from the tap, right?

850
00:54:51,794 --> 00:54:52,035
Scott: Yeah.

851
00:54:52,116 --> 00:54:54,730
Rym: And you want to filter it and keep it cold.

852
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:57,819
Scott: Even for me, like, my water is drinkable from the tap.

853
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:00,950
Scott: I'm in New York City, like, the best water, among the best waters, right?

854
00:55:01,451 --> 00:55:06,326
Scott: But, a lot of our fridge space is taken up by water pitchers, water bottles, right?

855
00:55:06,888 --> 00:55:07,650
Scott: Things of that nature.

856
00:55:08,251 --> 00:55:19,850
Scott: If we had the spigot on the front of the fridge, right, then I could save a lot of space in the fridge by not having all this water, like, saved up and all the time.

857
00:55:20,391 --> 00:55:23,830
Scott: It's like, yeah, I could drink from the tap, but the point is to make it cold first.

858
00:55:24,931 --> 00:55:28,970
Rym: At least our tap is shockingly cold, even in the dead of summer, for some reason.

859
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:30,054
Rym: Sometimes, sometimes.

860
00:55:30,074 --> 00:55:33,630
Scott: But it is a useful feature to have for space savings, right?

861
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:40,429
Scott: The ice that goes right into the glass, eh, okay, me, eh, you know.

862
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:50,290
Rym: I just find that most of the times, when I try to use one of those things at someone else's house, or, like, in an Airbnb, or anywhere that I encounter one, they fail in some way.

863
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:56,368
Rym: Even the last time I visited my brother, I go to use the ice maker, and suddenly he's like, "Ah, the ice maker doesn't really work, don't do it, don't touch

864
00:55:56,428 --> 00:55:56,468
Rym: it!".

865
00:55:57,276 --> 00:55:57,487
Scott: Yep.

866
00:55:57,871 --> 00:55:59,789
Rym: I just feel like they're cheap and they tend to break.

867
00:56:00,611 --> 00:56:05,630
Scott: Our fridge has the kind of ice maker I like, which is the one where you can turn it on and off.

868
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:09,910
Scott: Right now it's on, because I just used a bunch of ice, but I turn it off soon once the bucket fills up.

869
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:17,430
Scott: But basically, there's a bucket in the freezer, and you just turn it on, and you wait, and eventually the freezer bucket is full of ice, just tons of ice.

870
00:56:18,891 --> 00:56:26,950
Scott: And I like this because, A, you know, ice cube trays, I used to use those, and it's like you had to fill them, carry them to the freezer full of water.

871
00:56:27,711 --> 00:56:37,130
Scott: You can't really have that many trays in the freezer because there's not enough room, and you don't have that much ice, and then it sublimates if you don't use it quickly enough, and then you don't have ice when you want it.

872
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:43,309
Scott: The bucket full of ice in the freezer is just like, "Yep, there's just a fucking bucket full of ice, you can go wild with the

873
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:43,570
Scott: ice.".

874
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:49,090
Scott: It's like, oh, you want to, you know, you can put a couple cubes in a glass, you're like, just dip your glass in there like you're scooping.

875
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:51,256
Scott: You just scoop it all the way full, right?

876
00:56:51,276 --> 00:56:54,830
Scott: Take a water bottle, just jam it with ice all the way to the top.

877
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:59,190
Scott: You don't get to give a shit, you get so much ice, and you don't have to, you know, you don't have to work.

878
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:06,150
Scott: You don't have to like, you know, remember to manage the ice, or to make cubes, or to fill anything, it's just, it's always there.

879
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:12,910
Scott: And if it ever runs low, you push the button until it's full again, and then when it's done, you push the button one more time.

880
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:18,059
Rym: Now for whatever reason, I don't use ice, like, I almost never use ice in my day-to-day life.

881
00:57:25,251 --> 00:57:30,870
Rym: So all I have is one little silicone tray that makes four giant ice cubes with a cover on it so they don't sublimate.

882
00:57:32,992 --> 00:57:36,750
Rym: And anytime I use two of them, I put some water in there, so I always have ice cubes.

883
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:40,590
Scott: I mean, this time of year, you know, I'm filling coolers, I'm filling water bottles.

884
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:41,272
Scott: Coolers!

885
00:57:41,454 --> 00:57:44,110
Rym: I just go to the bodega and buy a bag of ice for a dollar.

886
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:46,889
Scott: That costs money, and you gotta carry the ice, and...

887
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:47,687
Rym: Bodega's right there!

888
00:57:49,113 --> 00:57:50,190
Scott: It's still, it's work, right?

889
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:53,110
Rym: Also, our freezer's usually pretty much full of food.

890
00:57:54,751 --> 00:57:56,118
Scott: Yeah, ours is not that full of food.

891
00:57:56,178 --> 00:57:57,284
Scott: There's only two people living here.

892
00:57:57,304 --> 00:57:58,450
Scott: Why would you have that much food in there?

893
00:57:58,550 --> 00:57:59,607
Rym: Well, we keep a lot of stuff in there.

894
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:01,040
Scott: Eat it!

895
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:02,590
Rym: Yeah, then we kill it with more!

896
00:58:07,732 --> 00:58:10,790
Rym: But living in an apartment is a little annoying because there are better fridges.

897
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:15,390
Rym: Like, I get a much better fridge than what we have, but I don't own this place, the building owns the fridge.

898
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:18,630
Scott: Yeah, when you rent, you don't have a choice of fridge, so I've never bought a fridge in my life.

899
00:58:18,994 --> 00:58:20,208
Rym: Yup, as much as I would want to.

900
00:58:21,450 --> 00:58:25,230
Rym: And, what's funny is a lot of people, even now, I see our friends still debating fridges.

901
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:38,430
Rym: A lot of people have a lot of shocking misconceptions about, like, how different configurations of fridges being more or less efficient, and it's almost all aesthetics and style, and very little of it affects the efficiency.

902
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:45,010
Rym: But, from what I do know, a handful of things that people would think would be more efficient end up being way less efficient.

903
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:51,130
Rym: Like, case in point, the drawer freezer, those things just jettison cold air compared to a regular one.

904
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:59,690
Scott: Yeah, I mean, well, people, I don't know how many people realize that, like, you know, you have a fridge, the cooling is all happening in the freezer, right?

905
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:10,210
Scott: The fridge, part of your refrigerator, is actually just getting, sort of, you know, the cool air left over from the freezer, sort of goes into the fridge by, like, a vent, and that's what makes the fridge cold.

906
00:59:10,851 --> 00:59:13,910
Scott: All the actual active cooling is happening in the freezer zone.

907
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:24,990
Scott: So, the classic style with the freezer on top, you know, cold air goes down, warm air goes up, is much more efficient than the freezer on bottom kind, right?

908
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:29,590
Scott: Because the cold air from the freezer just naturally goes down into the fridge on its own.

909
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:33,990
Scott: If you had to make the cold air go up, well, now, you know, it's not so simple, right?

910
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:35,909
Scott: You might have to have a little fan in there, who knows?

911
00:59:36,431 --> 00:59:52,230
Rym: Now, I will admit, if I owned a place and I were rich, I would be really interested in one of those integrated refrigeration systems, where you don't have just one big fridge, you just have some of your cupboards are just refrigerated to different temperatures.

912
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:53,711
Scott: Mm-hmm.

913
00:59:53,731 --> 01:00:05,467
Scott: I mean, as inefficient and wasteful as that is, the convenience and amazingness of, like, you know, "Hey, next to your cabinet full of glasses is a refrigerated cabinet full of

914
01:00:05,528 --> 01:00:05,989
Scott: beverages.".

915
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:13,670
Scott: And then, you know, next to where the cutting board is, right, in your work area, well, that's where the vegetable fridge is, right?

916
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:24,910
Rym: But also, depending, that could be more efficient if done in a nuanced way around things, like, not everything needs to be cooled to the temperature of a refrigerator.

917
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:29,450
Rym: Then we pick that temperature because that is safe for pretty much anything for a short amount of time.

918
01:00:30,211 --> 01:00:32,750
Rym: Like, that is a food safety temperature we've chosen.

919
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:38,650
Rym: But, like, a lot of vegetables, they'll keep on— Humidity also could be customized per fridge, yeah.

920
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:42,223
Rym: If they're just—they just need to be kept at a consistent temperature.

921
01:00:42,264 --> 01:00:53,370
Rym: that's slightly lower than room temperature, so a really weak-sauce Peltier system for the vegetable crisper could mean you don't have to waste all this energy cooling all your lettuces to 40 degrees Fahrenheit.

922
01:00:53,491 --> 01:00:56,310
Rym: Like, you could have—you could actually probably save energy.

923
01:00:56,910 --> 01:01:00,710
Rym: But, it's hard to calculate that because those are bespoke systems.

924
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:02,249
Rym: Like, that's not something you just go and buy.

925
01:01:02,631 --> 01:01:04,550
Rym: That's something a rich person gets installed into their house.

926
01:01:05,991 --> 01:01:10,990
Scott: Yeah, I mean, well, I mean, there are non-rich people who do have multiple fridges for other reasons, right?

927
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:16,670
Scott: Most notably, people who keep kosher, and they gotta separate their meat fridge from their dairy fridge.

928
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:17,152
Scott: Yup.

929
01:01:17,634 --> 01:01:20,390
Rym: I used to have because it was a gift, and it was actually really useful.

930
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:29,066
Rym: I had a wine fridge that—all it did was chill wine, but it—you know, wine doesn't need to get that cold, so it saved energy because it just kept the wine at the temperature.

931
01:01:29,087 --> 01:01:29,649
Rym: you would drink it.

932
01:01:30,070 --> 01:01:36,090
Rym: You type a number in, it just keeps it—but when that broke, I did not replace it because now I live in a tiny apartment.

933
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:37,192
Scott: Yup.

934
01:01:38,925 --> 01:01:39,570
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

935
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:43,950
Scott: But yeah, I guess there's, you know, the last thing I guess would be the other arrangements of fridges, right?

936
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:58,110
Rym: A lot of people seem to have strong opinions about, like, the doors, whether you should get the splitting doors or— Well, my only preference is there is anything where there's a divider between the two left and right side of the fridge seems just a complete waste of space.

937
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:04,284
Scott: Yeah, mine has the top doors split in the middle, but the inside of the fridge is one cavern.

938
01:02:04,324 --> 01:02:06,590
Scott: It's not—there's no split in the fridge.

939
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:08,034
Rym: Yeah.

940
01:02:08,074 --> 01:02:12,370
Rym: I like just one big cavern, and then a smaller one big cavern for the freezer.

941
01:02:14,692 --> 01:02:21,050
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I really don't care too much about the—people have such strong opinions, like, I don't care about the doors, right?

942
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:33,090
Scott: I care about the efficiency, and I care about how much space is inside to store food as long as it's enough for the food I have, and I care that it fits in the kitchen and, you know, fits nicely and doesn't stick out too far.

943
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:41,330
Rym: Which again, living in an apartment, like, one minor annoyance of our fridge, you know, our apartment's big, but it's still— It doesn't swing out and hit things or block the way or, you know.

944
01:02:41,611 --> 01:02:50,070
Rym: There is no way to remove the left bottom crisper drawer from our fridge without removing the entire refrigerator door.

945
01:02:51,490 --> 01:02:56,170
Rym: Because you cannot open the fridge door all the way around because it's up against the wall.

946
01:02:58,371 --> 01:03:05,230
Rym: And that's just an annoyance, there's literally no way around that, and that is not a concern for pretty much anyone who lives in a house, but if you live in an apartment—

947
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:11,170
Scott: That is a chore I do, like, once a year, is take all the things out of the fridge and clean them, all the shelves and the drawers and everything.

948
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:19,330
Rym: That one shelf, what I do is, when it's time to clean it— Yep, I open the fridge door, and then I clean it as fast as possible.

949
01:03:20,973 --> 01:03:22,390
Rym: Like, I'm in and out of there so quick.

950
01:03:23,371 --> 01:03:23,572
Scott: Yep.

951
01:03:24,255 --> 01:03:27,350
Scott: It is nice to have a rearrangeable shelf, you know, and such and such.

952
01:03:27,656 --> 01:03:27,744
Rym: Yep.

953
01:03:29,230 --> 01:03:36,370
Scott: Oh, the one other feature that our current fridge has that actually I do like is that if you accidentally leave the door open, it'll start beeping at you.

954
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:36,614
Scott: Ooh.

955
01:03:36,910 --> 01:03:42,590
Scott: It would have been a great help earlier in life, but our fridges did not do that when I was young.

956
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:50,430
Rym: So once, one time, I think I talked about this in GeekNights, we lost everything in the fridge because the door, like, a pressure thing happened, and the door popped open a tiny bit.

957
01:03:51,091 --> 01:03:53,390
Rym: There was this, it was opened by, I think, the tiniest bit.

958
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:59,670
Rym: And actually, a lot of the fridge, especially the lower part, still stayed, like, pretty cold.

959
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:05,269
Rym: But it was just open wide enough to where the light bulb in there turned on.

960
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:15,190
Rym: And that light bulb was an incandescent bulb pumping out 20 to 40 watts of heat, and it basically cooked everything in the top of the fridge.

961
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:17,030
Rym: So I had to throw out everything.

962
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:22,050
Rym: Had it not been an incandescent bulb, we probably would have lost almost nothing in that incident.

963
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:32,228
Rym: So I did replace both bulbs in our fridge with fridge-safe, cold-temperature-rated LEDs, and they output basically zero heat.

964
01:04:32,429 --> 01:04:33,130
Rym: Like, it's kind of amazing.

965
01:04:33,311 --> 01:04:39,510
Scott: My previous fridge, my previous apartment, I replaced the bulbs, but in this current fridge, I just have whatever it came with.

966
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:43,528
Scott: I don't even know, I guess if they die, yeah, I'm gonna replace them with the best possible LED.

967
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:46,890
Rym: Does he gotta get an LED that's designed for fridges?

968
01:04:47,671 --> 01:04:50,290
Scott: Oh yeah, obviously you always put a fridge-specific bulb in there.

969
01:04:50,770 --> 01:04:50,839
Scott: Yup.

970
01:04:52,330 --> 01:04:54,322
Rym: But, uh, yeah, refrigeration.

971
01:04:54,442 --> 01:04:55,670
Rym: Super important to humans.

972
01:04:56,890 --> 01:05:00,429
Rym: I camp and hike, I like camping and hiking and all that stuff.

973
01:05:00,931 --> 01:05:02,869
Rym: And, uh, can't just bring a fridge with you.

974
01:05:05,191 --> 01:05:09,450
Scott: I guess the last thing is that, you know, a lot of other features have been added to fridges these days.

975
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:18,210
Scott: They're trying to, you know, like, they get some fucking computers in there, and like, things to tell you how much food is left, or, you know, do some smart fridge bullshit.

976
01:05:19,031 --> 01:05:20,850
Scott: All that stuff sucks, get that shit out of here.

977
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:21,085
Scott: Yup.

978
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:23,010
Scott: Do not connect your refrigerator to the internet.

979
01:05:23,914 --> 01:05:25,321
Scott: I don't want a fridge with a screen on it.

980
01:05:25,441 --> 01:05:27,350
Scott: No, I don't want none of that shit, get that out of here.

981
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:37,050
Rym: Yup, unless the fridge were smart enough to, on its own, without me having to do anything, know an inventory of everything that's in it, and provide that to me via an open format.

982
01:05:37,310 --> 01:05:39,449
Scott: That's what they say they can do, but, uh, no.

983
01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:46,930
Rym: Yup, call me when they do that without me having to configure anything, and without me having to connect it to the internet.

984
01:05:47,835 --> 01:05:48,006
Scott: Yeah.

985
01:05:53,965 --> 01:05:56,100
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

986
01:05:56,300 --> 01:06:01,260
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

987
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:06,640
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

988
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,560
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

989
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:14,320
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

990
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,836
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

991
01:06:19,103 --> 01:06:22,140
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

992
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:25,260
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

993
01:06:50,109 --> 01:06:51,880
Rym: I simply leave you with...

994
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:40,853
Scott: (singing in Italian).

995
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,292
Scott: (singing in Italian).

996
01:08:44,979 --> 01:08:45,460
Rym: (singing in Italian).
