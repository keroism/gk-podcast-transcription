1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,283
Rym: It's Tuesday April 14th.

2
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:11,904
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,064 --> 00:00:14,247
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:14,287 --> 00:00:16,129
Rym: We talk about spooky games.

5
00:00:25,882 --> 00:00:33,000
Scott: Let's do this Being home not working.

6
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:39,840
Scott: I'm well not working at an official job with a where I have to file at the w2 and such.

7
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:42,672
Rym: But instead of working hard at being a bum.

8
00:00:43,014 --> 00:00:44,400
Scott: I'm working hard at actual stuff.

9
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,747
Scott: I'm doing a lot of stuff anyway.

10
00:00:46,787 --> 00:00:48,573
Scott: related thing one of the things that you know.

11
00:00:48,653 --> 00:00:52,625
Scott: and even if you're working hard on real stuff You can't do it all day.

12
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:57,000
Scott: You gotta you know even the hardest work in workaholic person has to take a little break.

13
00:00:57,141 --> 00:01:00,720
Scott: You know whether it's a watch a little TV read a little book.

14
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:06,958
Scott: You know something to ease the mind, so I've been playing earthbound in the emulator.

15
00:01:06,978 --> 00:01:09,228
Rym: now You've beaten earthbound.

16
00:01:09,308 --> 00:01:10,756
Scott: I assume yeah a long time ago.

17
00:01:11,078 --> 00:01:13,867
Rym: once Ben is it long enough to where?

18
00:01:13,887 --> 00:01:15,715
Rym: you don't remember all the little details.

19
00:01:15,815 --> 00:01:16,900
Scott: I don't remember the details.

20
00:01:17,021 --> 00:01:19,132
Scott: I only remember the generic parts.

21
00:01:19,735 --> 00:01:23,685
Scott: You know the the Fundamental facts, I don't.

22
00:01:23,725 --> 00:01:24,869
Scott: you know the small thing like.

23
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:30,290
Scott: I don't remember individual dialogues and things like that anyway But yeah, I've been.

24
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:31,200
Scott: I've been playing it again.

25
00:01:31,461 --> 00:01:47,087
Scott: I think it's kind of weird how when I had a job like I mean earthbound is You know a Japanese style RPG at its at its core even though the rest of it is sort of not you know anything Final Fantasy game,

26
00:01:47,127 --> 00:01:49,680
Rym: it's like a comedy game, and there's a lot of interesting elements

27
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,182
Scott: I just think.

28
00:01:50,543 --> 00:02:08,571
Scott: well first of all I want to point out isn't it weird how like there's the vast majority of Japanese style RPG type games are fantasy slash sci-fi one of the other or both and like so few are not and Earthbound is like just one of the ones that isn't you know.

29
00:02:08,612 --> 00:02:10,660
Rym: like is he had Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy?

30
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:12,927
Scott: Yeah, it's it right.

31
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,031
Scott: so first of all.

32
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,235
Scott: It's not fantasy.

33
00:02:15,475 --> 00:02:16,739
Scott: I guess it's kind of sci-fi.

34
00:02:17,402 --> 00:02:26,280
Scott: It's a kid with psychic powers going around saving the world from From aliens and monsters with it with a baseball bat right anyway.

35
00:02:27,182 --> 00:02:38,940
Scott: But that aside perfectly realistic, but it's weird how now that I don't have a job like suddenly RPGs are tolerable at least a little bit more tolerable than they used to be I don't know.

36
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:44,937
Scott: I think it's how tolerable a time-wasting game is is directly a function of how much time you have to waste.

37
00:02:45,118 --> 00:02:49,940
Rym: well by the same Token you know I'm playing through chrono trigger again, and I'm also in that situation.

38
00:02:50,061 --> 00:02:51,435
Rym: I don't remember a lot of the details.

39
00:02:51,496 --> 00:02:56,616
Rym: and But every time I find something in the game like it all comes back And I'm remembering how much I love that game.

40
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:03,967
Scott: well I think what it was is you know back in the day when I had time for RPGs the thing that frustrated me Was random encounters.

41
00:03:04,107 --> 00:03:04,368
Scott: right.

42
00:03:04,448 --> 00:03:13,240
Scott: and I'd like to point out the chrono trigger and earthbound of All JRPGs are some of the best at the way they handle the random encounter right because they still have them.

43
00:03:13,441 --> 00:03:20,341
Scott: They're there they have them right, but earthbound and chrono trigger first of all it's not random like you're walking around the map And suddenly this bad guys It's.

44
00:03:20,361 --> 00:03:22,088
Scott: you see the bad guys on the screen.

45
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:31,795
Scott: you can sort of run away from them or try to Or you can sort of sneak up on them and get them from behind for a sneak attack Or if they sneak up behind you you get sneak attacked right.

46
00:03:32,237 --> 00:03:38,887
Scott: and also Earthbound has the best thing in the world which is if you bump into a bad guy Who's just so weak that you can't.

47
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:45,139
Scott: they can't possibly hurt you they just die and you get the experience You don't even have to do the fight, and that's that's pretty great.

48
00:03:45,942 --> 00:03:48,370
Rym: I wish the threshold had been a little higher the threshold.

49
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,818
Rym: I believe is they couldn't possibly do any damage.

50
00:03:50,838 --> 00:04:02,007
Scott: well actually yeah That's true, but actually it's surprising like how sometimes you know a bad guy You'll bump into you'll think you have to fight it, but then it just dies like oh, yeah, sweet Like you'll even level up because of it.

51
00:04:02,027 --> 00:04:03,171
Scott: you'll get so much experience.

52
00:04:03,552 --> 00:04:14,712
Scott: another thing is usually when you beat a boss in an area They'll make you walk out back the way you came in sometimes But when they do that All the bad guys like be running away from you, or they'll all be gone.

53
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:15,936
Scott: Which is pretty awesome.

54
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:22,100
Rym: It's weird though I I often would be very miffed when I had to walk out of something.

55
00:04:22,723 --> 00:04:23,647
Rym: Final Fantasy did that.

56
00:04:23,688 --> 00:04:27,606
Scott: well you can use if you have an exit mouse or You know whatever like.

57
00:04:27,626 --> 00:04:32,131
Rym: remember Final Fantasy you if you beat the fiends they were teleports You're right back out, and we beat Garland.

58
00:04:32,151 --> 00:04:33,279
Rym: they teleport you right back out.

59
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:39,640
Rym: Yeah, but when you hike into that goddamn cave to get the floater or something you had to hike all the way back out.

60
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,462
Rym: Yes, you didn't.

61
00:04:40,543 --> 00:04:47,060
Rym: but it was this odd as you had to get in get the thing and get out without dying Or it was all for naught.

62
00:04:47,322 --> 00:04:48,006
Scott: I think you know.

63
00:04:48,227 --> 00:04:53,860
Scott: so I think the fact that those things are made You know easier is part of the reason I can continue to play earthbound.

64
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,540
Scott: But I think another reason I can continue to play it is that I'm in an emulator.

65
00:04:57,962 --> 00:05:01,340
Scott: So I can do the save and load state which helps a lot, right?

66
00:05:02,883 --> 00:05:04,456
Scott: And I could do a lot of cheating tricks with that.

67
00:05:04,497 --> 00:05:10,360
Scott: for example I can go to the guy who sells hints save talk get a hint for $75 then load and get my money back.

68
00:05:10,681 --> 00:05:12,447
Rym: I see you play money-making game.

69
00:05:12,527 --> 00:05:13,792
Scott: I play money-making game.

70
00:05:13,832 --> 00:05:17,886
Rym: indeed old man run money-making game Always win.

71
00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:34,668
Scott: I'll also do other things such as Save the game get into a fight use the spy ability to figure out what the bad guys weaknesses are Load then do it again, and so that I you know can instead of wasting an action on spy I can waste spend an action on doing damage.

72
00:05:34,728 --> 00:05:38,100
Rym: You know what else would do that cheating game facts game genie.

73
00:05:40,212 --> 00:05:46,080
Scott: So And something else I think that makes the game a lot more tolerable and isn't necessarily cheating.

74
00:05:46,841 --> 00:05:50,040
Scott: Is I'm using an Xbox 360 controller to play this game, right?

75
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:56,380
Scott: So I only really need the d-pad the four button the four face buttons LR and start and select, right?

76
00:05:56,784 --> 00:05:58,360
Scott: So I've got a lot of extra buttons going on.

77
00:05:59,921 --> 00:06:07,152
Scott: So what I did is I took r2 and I bound r2 to speed up the emulator So I can walk real fast.

78
00:06:07,232 --> 00:06:08,700
Scott: I don't need to use like a skip sandwich.

79
00:06:08,861 --> 00:06:12,778
Scott: You know I can just or like if there's a guy who's got a really long dialogue.

80
00:06:12,798 --> 00:06:13,300
Scott: That's annoying.

81
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:20,511
Scott: I'll just hold down r2 while pushing the button to speed through the dialogue real quick Like when the fuzzy pickles guy comes up comes down.

82
00:06:20,571 --> 00:06:22,176
Scott: I'll make him go away in like two seconds.

83
00:06:22,196 --> 00:06:29,480
Rym: I Remember I had that for my SNES emulator when I was working it as an SNES emulator But I didn't have it for my NES emulator.

84
00:06:30,085 --> 00:06:39,894
Rym: So as a result I would play games And I got so used to the speed up that I would hit it when I was playing NES games And it wouldn't do anything and I'd get so frustrated.

85
00:06:39,914 --> 00:06:41,080
Rym: I just quit right that in there.

86
00:06:41,281 --> 00:06:41,943
Scott: Yeah, but it's like.

87
00:06:41,983 --> 00:06:43,508
Scott: you know when I'm instead of wasting.

88
00:06:43,588 --> 00:06:49,700
Scott: You know like 30 seconds walking down like this street I'll walk down the street in like three seconds.

89
00:06:49,901 --> 00:06:51,188
Rym: You know what game could have used that.

90
00:06:51,308 --> 00:06:56,174
Rym: you know what game would have would have been a thousand times better If I gave you a game where you walk really really slow Pokemon.

91
00:06:56,234 --> 00:07:02,159
Scott: Yeah My god forget the bicycle whoosh who needs that?

92
00:07:03,462 --> 00:07:05,231
Scott: Or in fact get on the bicycle.

93
00:07:05,272 --> 00:07:06,800
Scott: Yeah, you go even faster whoo.

94
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,632
Scott: It's Good, but I think I heard the Pokemon Platinum actually has faster combat.

95
00:07:12,973 --> 00:07:15,020
Rym: Thank the gods of course little too little too late.

96
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,312
Rym: I like your strategy of always buy the second Pokemon.

97
00:07:18,392 --> 00:07:20,420
Scott: It's like I regret buying diamond.

98
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,650
Scott: I should have just waited and bought the platinum one.

99
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,096
Scott: I should have known they were gonna do it.

100
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:27,089
Scott: so next time I'm just gonna buy the platinum equivalent.

101
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,158
Rym: next time you can buy it and then buy.

102
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:30,827
Scott: yep That's what I can do all right.

103
00:07:31,068 --> 00:07:34,405
Scott: Yeah, earthbound if you haven't played earthbound Good game.

104
00:07:34,465 --> 00:07:37,460
Scott: normally we're anti of that kind of RPG.

105
00:07:37,941 --> 00:07:40,371
Scott: You know it's called RPG, but it really shouldn't be.

106
00:07:40,411 --> 00:07:42,860
Rym: earthbound or mother is one of those exceptions.

107
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,682
Rym: Yeah, it's it's like.

108
00:07:43,743 --> 00:07:45,909
Scott: well mother one is the NES game.

109
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,757
Scott: really you shouldn't play that whole game.

110
00:07:48,838 --> 00:07:50,203
Scott: It's not worth it It's too much.

111
00:07:50,284 --> 00:07:51,049
Scott: It's it's just.

112
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:51,994
Rym: it's worth playing.

113
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:52,497
Rym: the beginning.

114
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,904
Scott: well It's very very big.

115
00:07:53,944 --> 00:07:56,033
Scott: just play it to see what it was like.

116
00:07:56,074 --> 00:07:57,480
Scott: don't actually play it to win.

117
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:57,941
Scott: You know.

118
00:07:57,961 --> 00:08:01,554
Scott: just play it to see what the game was about what how it worked etc.

119
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:11,479
Scott: right earthbound or mother Too as it is known in Japan play that entire game And then I have the mother three fan translation in a GBA emulator.

120
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,370
Scott: So I'm gonna play that when I'm done with earthbound.

121
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:21,984
Rym: about the slash mother - but you know I'm thinking one of the reasons I feel like Chrono Trigger is tolerable to me even though.

122
00:08:22,004 --> 00:08:24,989
Rym: I have a job, and it's not just nostalgia is that I?

123
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:32,885
Rym: Mostly play it when I'm idle like on the train or like someplace when I'm waiting for something or doing anything like that Primarily on the train mm-hmm.

124
00:08:32,947 --> 00:08:40,539
Rym: so whenever I play a game like that at home I feel like I should be doing something because I should be doing something.

125
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:42,628
Scott: E-commerce I got a lot of shit.

126
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:43,111
Scott: You didn't do.

127
00:08:43,513 --> 00:08:46,027
Rym: yeah, I've been busy unlike you I have a job you're talking about.

128
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:46,872
Scott: I'm doing so much shit.

129
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:47,556
Scott: You have no idea.

130
00:08:47,677 --> 00:08:52,254
Scott: Yeah, yeah Today I did more today than I've done like in a long time.

131
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:53,379
Rym: Yeah, I did a lot too.

132
00:08:54,002 --> 00:09:03,420
Rym: But anyway on the train or if I were jobless let's say I Wouldn't feel this need to be doing something kind of like it Wildwood when we go to the beach.

133
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:10,779
Rym: I feel it needs to be doing something now more than ever but see when I like when I'm at the beach I don't think oh I could be working on GeekNights, or oh, I got a.

134
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:17,006
Scott: true I think Yeah at the beach I could definitely.

135
00:09:17,046 --> 00:09:17,929
Scott: I mean think about it.

136
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:20,357
Scott: most of my Pokemon playing was down the Wildwood days.

137
00:09:20,377 --> 00:09:20,799
Scott: remember that.

138
00:09:20,819 --> 00:09:21,685
Rym: I Remember that.

139
00:09:21,745 --> 00:09:22,412
Rym: I remember I was.

140
00:09:22,594 --> 00:09:25,086
Scott: we were all Okay to just push.

141
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:28,080
Scott: sit there pushing a for a few hours when you're at the beach.

142
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,008
Scott: He got nothing else doing.

143
00:09:29,028 --> 00:09:29,814
Scott: why not push a?

144
00:09:29,935 --> 00:09:36,840
Rym: at one point I was watching something on TV playing Pokemon with one hand and playing Civ 4 on the laptop at the same time.

145
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:37,846
Scott: Oh, that's a good time.

146
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:38,953
Rym: That was a real good time.

147
00:09:39,094 --> 00:09:42,694
Rym: all right, but You all should know this is coming.

148
00:09:42,734 --> 00:09:43,500
Rym: We've talked about it.

149
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:49,360
Rym: Everyone's talked about it, but it's been street dated the Wii motion and Wii Sports resorts.

150
00:09:49,945 --> 00:09:51,339
Scott: We forgot all about that thing.

151
00:09:51,623 --> 00:09:53,080
Scott: I don't even know what's going on in the way.

152
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,110
Scott: It's been so long since they even turned it on or played it that I have no idea What's going on on the way or anything?

153
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,771
Rym: I haven't played a non virtual console game And I don't know what Wii games are coming out.

154
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,320
Scott: I don't know Wii games are out.

155
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:08,297
Scott: I mean they announced the Wii motion, and then I completely forgot about it, and now it's.

156
00:10:08,337 --> 00:10:09,340
Scott: they're actually releasing it.

157
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,965
Scott: I'm like oh, yeah, when that thing?

158
00:10:11,025 --> 00:10:14,214
Rym: when do they announce that it's gonna be available on June 8th?

159
00:10:14,675 --> 00:10:18,458
Scott: all right for 20 bucks All right, not buying it.

160
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:26,285
Rym: Probably as people pointed out if you buy for remotes for remotions and for dun shucks That's basically a ps3.

161
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:27,770
Scott: Oh my god.

162
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:33,908
Scott: Yeah, yeah, I mean Nintendo has always Always been about the accessories.

163
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:36,657
Scott: trying to sell you power pads trying to sell you power gloves.

164
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:43,621
Scott: trying to sell you Memory cards trying to say memory expansion cards for your Nintendo 64 the Nintendo 64.

165
00:10:43,621 --> 00:10:45,729
Scott: You know why they made four controller slots.

166
00:10:46,111 --> 00:10:48,440
Scott: not because they thought four player gaming would be fun.

167
00:10:48,961 --> 00:10:52,373
Scott: They could sell you three controllers instead of just one more controller.

168
00:10:52,534 --> 00:10:57,489
Scott: remember when they did that on the any Score and it'll sell you a four score.

169
00:10:57,629 --> 00:10:59,095
Scott: They'd sell you an NES advantage.

170
00:10:59,135 --> 00:11:00,480
Scott: They would sell you an NES max.

171
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:01,719
Scott: They'd sell you a zapper.

172
00:11:02,382 --> 00:11:03,505
Scott: Right you know that was.

173
00:11:03,525 --> 00:11:06,713
Scott: that's what Nintendo's been about and that's always where the money is.

174
00:11:06,773 --> 00:11:12,468
Scott: the margins on accessories are Ginormous compared to the margins on games and console.

175
00:11:12,488 --> 00:11:12,608
Scott: Well.

176
00:11:12,668 --> 00:11:16,859
Rym: I wouldn't use the word ginormous because ginormous because it's not a fucking word.

177
00:11:18,421 --> 00:11:23,216
Scott: I mean the Wii motion probably cost them like a dollar or two to make.

178
00:11:23,356 --> 00:11:25,224
Scott: I mean I wonder is Didn't?

179
00:11:25,445 --> 00:11:26,754
Rym: there are only two options here.

180
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:37,320
Rym: either Nintendo originally said you know thought we're going to make the Wii and then someone in engineering said we can't get it as Accurate as you guys promised in time.

181
00:11:37,922 --> 00:11:51,425
Rym: So why do we split off the accurate thing and we'll release it as is it's good enough And then we'll release this bundle later, or they said we could make it more accurate now, or we could charge 1999 mega time.

182
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:52,835
Rym: make a team make it to make it to.

183
00:11:55,261 --> 00:11:57,567
Scott: It was fine, I'm not sure what the situation was.

184
00:11:57,668 --> 00:12:02,140
Scott: I would not discount any of these reasonable explanations that we can come up with.

185
00:12:02,242 --> 00:12:03,158
Scott: It could be any one of them.

186
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,326
Rym: But what's interesting is the reports.

187
00:12:05,427 --> 00:12:13,790
Rym: when this first first came out and there were demos for some reporters and everything Was that it wasn't any different, and I kind of expected that.

188
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:17,940
Rym: but now there are reports coming out that it's actually a lot different.

189
00:12:18,141 --> 00:12:22,564
Scott: I mean someone I think at EA said it's too Precise like it's.

190
00:12:22,745 --> 00:12:29,146
Scott: it's exactly one-to-one like the fidgeting of your hand is picked up by this thing Which is and that they have to.

191
00:12:29,346 --> 00:12:33,240
Scott: they have to decrease the sensitivity on it in order to actually make the game playable?

192
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,364
Rym: No, no all they get.

193
00:12:34,424 --> 00:12:35,870
Rym: all that means is that they need.

194
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,580
Rym: they can make better kinds of games.

195
00:12:39,187 --> 00:12:41,403
Scott: Hopefully we don't Trust with.

196
00:12:41,423 --> 00:12:43,593
Scott: some guy at EA says you know it's like I need to.

197
00:12:43,613 --> 00:12:47,206
Scott: I need to experience this Probably at a PAX demo station.

198
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:47,828
Rym: see there.

199
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:51,980
Rym: There are two very important eras in rims gaming life.

200
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,431
Rym: I'll call them the pre and the post.

201
00:12:53,451 --> 00:13:03,799
Rym: the ad in the BC Before WarioWare smooth moves came out and after Because that was when the dream died.

202
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:07,600
Scott: You know that game would have been just fine if the multiplayer had good modes.

203
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,526
Scott: If you wouldn't the Wii part wouldn't have mattered.

204
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:10,288
Rym: no wouldn't have.

205
00:13:10,328 --> 00:13:12,153
Rym: but you know what they butch.

206
00:13:12,294 --> 00:13:17,752
Rym: the only part of the game the series the entire Ever good.

207
00:13:17,772 --> 00:13:22,839
Scott: the part the game where you catch the things and sort of hold them up is okay was a great $5 minigame.

208
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,426
Rym: Yes, it was was not a great.

209
00:13:25,487 --> 00:13:27,735
Scott: even fight at $1 50 cents.

210
00:13:28,056 --> 00:13:28,397
Scott: Did nice.

211
00:13:28,578 --> 00:13:29,180
Scott: I sold the game.

212
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,989
Scott: I think I think you did Amazon.

213
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:33,387
Scott: yeah It was did I?

214
00:13:33,407 --> 00:13:35,640
Rym: I don't remember it wasn't the worst game on the Wii.

215
00:13:35,921 --> 00:13:37,730
Rym: I mean remember that monkey ball.

216
00:13:38,091 --> 00:13:39,940
Scott: Yeah, I sold that definitely an Amazon.

217
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,688
Rym: That was possibly the worst game ever made, but you know what.

218
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:49,270
Scott: actually thinking back right and on all the Wii games That because we've got quite a few Wii games.

219
00:13:49,751 --> 00:13:50,514
Scott: You know Wii games.

220
00:13:50,574 --> 00:13:52,260
Scott: I played the most I played.

221
00:13:52,681 --> 00:13:54,127
Rym: Let's see Mike Tyson's punch-out.

222
00:13:54,488 --> 00:13:54,648
Scott: Well.

223
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:59,643
Scott: I mean Wii games actual games on discs for the Wii The tennis.

224
00:14:00,345 --> 00:14:01,187
Rym: no that was GameCube.

225
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:05,500
Scott: Yeah, huh, you know what games I played the most for the Wii.

226
00:14:05,921 --> 00:14:06,563
Rym: I've zero.

227
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:07,024
Scott: well.

228
00:14:07,466 --> 00:14:08,911
Scott: No that was a GameCube game.

229
00:14:08,951 --> 00:14:11,680
Scott: Yeah, huh, you know what gives away the most of the way.

230
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,168
Scott: Okay, well the Zelda game comes in second place.

231
00:14:14,409 --> 00:14:15,874
Scott: the Metroid game comes in third.

232
00:14:15,915 --> 00:14:18,992
Scott: the Zelda game was a GameCube game That's true.

233
00:14:19,032 --> 00:14:20,060
Rym: They just made it on the way.

234
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,494
Scott: So okay the Metroid game was in second place.

235
00:14:23,514 --> 00:14:24,177
Scott: You know what the game.

236
00:14:24,217 --> 00:14:26,098
Scott: I played the most excite truck.

237
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,613
Scott: Huh yeah Excite truck is actually really good.

238
00:14:30,633 --> 00:14:31,558
Scott: looking back got it.

239
00:14:32,543 --> 00:14:36,260
Scott: You know I mean I think and I think this they're making like something else.

240
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:40,738
Scott: They're making like some sort of monster thing or like you drive creatures around.

241
00:14:40,798 --> 00:14:41,340
Scott: I don't know what to do.

242
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,977
Scott: it's like excite something else they're doing I don't know.

243
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:47,652
Scott: but Whatever, it's just looking back on that.

244
00:14:47,672 --> 00:14:56,428
Scott: It's like huh really Wow Honestly, yeah, honestly late excite truck the most before WarioWare smooth moves which I kind of.

245
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:04,298
Rym: what that really entails is when I realized that Nintendo will never allow any of its platforms to achieve what they could possibly achieve.

246
00:15:04,318 --> 00:15:07,349
Rym: yep I mean back in the Crystal Chronicles day.

247
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:10,480
Rym: when they tried I all I could think was that this is it.

248
00:15:10,801 --> 00:15:17,360
Rym: Nintendo has proven that they can do something awesome and different, but what Nintendo saw was everyone hated that game.

249
00:15:17,801 --> 00:15:21,852
Scott: Well, I think what happened right is that the GameCube right.

250
00:15:21,933 --> 00:15:31,690
Scott: the GameCube was actually kind of awesome Right, but the thing is is people don't care about good gameplay And that's why Miyamoto is sad in the GameCube era.

251
00:15:31,851 --> 00:15:34,100
Scott: right because people didn't care about the awesome game.

252
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,313
Rym: I did an entire show on this topic right.

253
00:15:36,675 --> 00:15:53,876
Scott: so people were buying PlayStation twos which had quantity and not so much quality well they had quality there too, but a lot of quantity more so So when the Wii came around people like us were psyched up for because it was like wow we're gonna get all the awesome Games that like the GameCube had only on this Wii with this motion stuff.

254
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:54,680
Scott: It's gonna be awesome.

255
00:15:55,563 --> 00:16:03,339
Scott: But they they dropped the quality of the GameCube games by the wayside when they made the Wii And that's why the Wii is sitting there not being played.

256
00:16:03,621 --> 00:16:07,311
Rym: But so pre Wario or smooth moves Rym would have said.

257
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:13,276
Rym: now they can make the freaking Star Wars lightsaber game and it'll be the best game ever.

258
00:16:13,357 --> 00:16:21,640
Rym: but now What I know is what I what I predict is that they're going to make a bunch of very uninspired Wii Sports clones.

259
00:16:22,323 --> 00:16:26,620
Rym: One or two people are gonna make games that use this thing and then it's just gonna completely disappear.

260
00:16:26,846 --> 00:16:34,664
Rym: That's right And all the fanboys will have bought one and all the grandma's will have bought one because now they can play the next Wii sports game.

261
00:16:35,007 --> 00:16:37,743
Scott: maybe and That's it that that's it.

262
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:40,632
Rym: like I I've basically given up on Nintendo.

263
00:16:40,672 --> 00:16:46,284
Rym: unless they prove to me unless they try to make another Crystal Chronicles, yeah They did.

264
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:48,434
Scott: well there is one for the Wii isn't there?

265
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:52,269
Rym: I have no son And there was no sequel to Crystal Chronicles.

266
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:55,200
Scott: No, I'm pretty sure there's a new one the way have no son.

267
00:16:55,321 --> 00:16:57,133
Scott: No, I'm pretty sure there's a new one for the Wii.

268
00:16:57,354 --> 00:16:58,160
Rym: Yeah, and when's it coming?

269
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,344
Scott: I think it's out right now.

270
00:16:59,525 --> 00:17:01,192
Rym: and did it integrate the DS?

271
00:17:01,393 --> 00:17:01,976
Scott: I think it did.

272
00:17:01,996 --> 00:17:02,116
Rym: did it.

273
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,871
Scott: Yeah, I didn't pay attention cuz I'm not on a job.

274
00:17:05,931 --> 00:17:08,280
Scott: I can't buy it, but you can go investigate it after the show.

275
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,503
Rym: I'm highly dubious of this.

276
00:17:09,886 --> 00:17:10,628
Scott: go investigate.

277
00:17:10,648 --> 00:17:11,010
Scott: I heard it.

278
00:17:11,451 --> 00:17:12,916
Scott: Anyway, I'm a taiko talking about it.

279
00:17:12,936 --> 00:17:15,486
Rym: Uh-huh I'm just I'm very leery.

280
00:17:15,506 --> 00:17:16,430
Scott: All right, so I got.

281
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,193
Scott: I got a news here.

282
00:17:17,313 --> 00:17:22,411
Scott: Oh, yeah, so apparently I'm not gonna go through the whole story here.

283
00:17:22,471 --> 00:17:24,520
Scott: You can read the story in this blog posting.

284
00:17:25,202 --> 00:17:30,496
Scott: But basically there was a sequel to punch-out that was being made at some point.

285
00:17:30,657 --> 00:17:42,190
Scott: that was going to be called Mike Tyson's power punch, right and in the game you actually played as Mike Tyson and Don King was there instead of you know Doc, whatever, but Little Mac.

286
00:17:42,512 --> 00:17:50,790
Scott: I know Little Mac wasn't in this game But you know for reasons Pertaining to Mike Tyson and other things this game was not made.

287
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:58,540
Scott: a game called power punch 2 was released But that game did not involve Mike Tyson in any way and it was also terrible.

288
00:17:58,822 --> 00:18:02,483
Scott: Of course, Mike Tyson's power punch was also terrible Power punch.

289
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:09,844
Scott: Mike Tyson's power punch is a game where Mike Tyson punches aliens much like that episode of Dexter's lab where with macho man Randy seven.

290
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:10,569
Rym: Oh my god.

291
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,434
Rym: All right, Scott.

292
00:18:11,454 --> 00:18:15,920
Rym: I got interrupt and monkey I have to interrupt in the middle.

293
00:18:18,224 --> 00:18:25,168
Rym: The Wii version of Crystal Chronicles is almost identical to that The the DS.

294
00:18:25,449 --> 00:18:26,554
Scott: Oh, you looked it up already.

295
00:18:26,755 --> 00:18:28,020
Scott: Yes, okay quotes.

296
00:18:28,742 --> 00:18:32,574
Rym: The Wii version of the game contains all of the major elements of the DS version.

297
00:18:32,814 --> 00:18:34,178
Scott: Oh, yeah, it's just is it?

298
00:18:34,219 --> 00:18:40,215
Rym: a port comma But must be played on a single screen period.

299
00:18:40,957 --> 00:18:41,720
Rym: to compensate.

300
00:18:42,802 --> 00:18:46,679
Rym: This version has two adjustable in-game fucking screen.

301
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:50,699
Rym: There's no integration with the DS listed here.

302
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,092
Scott: Bullshit, oh my god.

303
00:18:54,112 --> 00:18:55,279
Scott: I thought it was a new game.

304
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,286
Scott: It's just the DS game for the Wii.

305
00:18:57,547 --> 00:19:04,860
Rym: the fact that they just give you a split screen, I guess Oh fuck that Wow Wow Wow.

306
00:19:05,902 --> 00:19:23,120
Scott: Okay, anyway, okay, so this power punch game Basically some collector had it right And the community had to get $1,500 together to get the dude to give the game up so that they could rip a rob and share the ROM with the world.

307
00:19:23,802 --> 00:19:29,020
Scott: And so I want to you know, the news is you can go get this ROM and play it of this terrible old game.

308
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,619
Scott: That's actually historically significant even though it's terrible.

309
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,712
Scott: But I want to start a discussion.

310
00:19:35,732 --> 00:19:38,931
Scott: I don't want to have the discussion right now I just want to pose this question out there.

311
00:19:38,951 --> 00:19:40,260
Scott: Maybe we'll discuss it later, right?

312
00:19:40,842 --> 00:19:45,356
Scott: Let's say I had a Van Gogh some historically significant piece of artwork, right?

313
00:19:45,396 --> 00:19:53,780
Scott: Yeah, it's very important Yep, and we had the technological capability to like perfectly duplicate this historic piece of work.

314
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:59,680
Scott: You know Adam by Adam right would and there was only one of them in the world left right say the Mona Lisa, right?

315
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,136
Scott: Would we not be you know?

316
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:10,200
Scott: Morally like required to use that technology to make a duplicate, you know for this historically significant thing.

317
00:20:11,941 --> 00:20:19,280
Scott: so these collectors who are like Holding these games, you know that they have the only copy in the known universe.

318
00:20:19,642 --> 00:20:23,219
Scott: We have the technology to perfectly duplicate them and they're just not giving them up.

319
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:30,404
Scott: I think that this that's a serious a serious problem and it need we need to do something about it because it's not Say that I disagree.

320
00:20:30,424 --> 00:20:32,110
Rym: Yeah, I would love to play this game.

321
00:20:32,712 --> 00:20:34,258
Scott: Well, you can it's a free ROM now.

322
00:20:34,418 --> 00:20:37,092
Rym: Yes Okay, anyway to get it out there more.

323
00:20:37,717 --> 00:20:41,510
Rym: It's out there But how many people know about it except for all of you?

324
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,115
Scott: now just it was on Kotaku.

325
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:44,560
Scott: plenty of people know about it.

326
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:51,100
Rym: You know, I feel like not that many of our readers read things like Kotaku or College Humor.

327
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:52,145
Scott: I know right.

328
00:20:52,205 --> 00:20:57,587
Scott: Maybe maybe you should because that's where we get our news Pretty much like 80% of them.

329
00:20:57,687 --> 00:20:57,948
Scott: Yeah.

330
00:20:58,028 --> 00:20:59,814
Rym: All right, and the rest are from slash shot.

331
00:21:00,054 --> 00:21:02,060
Scott: Yeah, so go ahead with your news.

332
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,042
Rym: I already did my name.

333
00:21:03,122 --> 00:21:03,843
Scott: Oh, that was your news.

334
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:12,960
Rym: Okay, so then I guess it's time for things of the day.

335
00:21:13,461 --> 00:21:16,250
Scott: This thing of the day is so epically fucking amazing.

336
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:16,731
Scott: Oh, is it?

337
00:21:16,932 --> 00:21:17,534
Scott: Oh shit.

338
00:21:17,815 --> 00:21:22,490
Scott: All right, so so This is a video right?

339
00:21:22,671 --> 00:21:29,484
Scott: The story is in 1993 1993 when I was 8 11 11 years old.

340
00:21:32,121 --> 00:21:43,174
Scott: Dan Linton a guy who ran a BBS called software creations went to Tejas and in his in Tejas He went to id software which is where they made Wolfenstein and doom and everything right.

341
00:21:43,194 --> 00:21:58,690
Scott: Wolfenstein Wolfenstein DeStein Goldberg, okay so Wolfenstein came out before 1993 but doom came out in 93 or 94.

342
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:03,290
Scott: So this was this video was taken Before doom was finished and released.

343
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,840
Scott: before doom one was finished and released, right?

344
00:22:06,402 --> 00:22:10,600
Scott: And it's a kind of a long video that John Romero has posted on Vimeo here.

345
00:22:12,221 --> 00:22:23,737
Scott: But this video you should watch the whole thing and pay attention to every minute of it because it is like epically Historic and amazing and I mean the main things you got to get out of this video.

346
00:22:23,757 --> 00:22:31,759
Scott: if you get nothing else Right is that you watching this video the people in software early in the video They're playing Aladdin for the Sega Genesis, which just came out.

347
00:22:32,201 --> 00:22:37,360
Scott: So that was like a top-of-the-line game right at this point in time And that game was pretty good.

348
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:47,789
Scott: but then you compare that top-of-the-line game Aladdin for the Sega Genesis, which is actually a really good game it is and Compare that to the unfinished doom that is using.

349
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:48,872
Scott: that is not even.

350
00:22:48,972 --> 00:22:52,624
Scott: that is still using sound effects from the Super Nintendo Wolfenstein.

351
00:22:52,885 --> 00:22:54,552
Rym: right this is probably I did.

352
00:22:54,612 --> 00:22:55,516
Rym: I didn't watch the whole video.

353
00:22:55,536 --> 00:22:56,099
Rym: Do they shoot a BFG?

354
00:22:57,082 --> 00:22:57,525
Scott: I don't know.

355
00:22:57,646 --> 00:23:01,940
Rym: but because the BFG used to use different Mechanics and they had to change it.

356
00:23:01,982 --> 00:23:02,864
Rym: Yeah I've all started.

357
00:23:02,884 --> 00:23:13,934
Scott: but I mean you watch this video of John Romero Demonstrating doom and then having like one of the first death matches in all of history right with one of the other guys that in software while this guy is videoing it.

358
00:23:14,636 --> 00:23:20,960
Scott: and I mean You learn that the mean nowadays the doom is not so amazing, right?

359
00:23:21,903 --> 00:23:24,140
Scott: And you know you think of doom is this historic FPS.

360
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:32,887
Scott: But really the gap between doom and all the other games at the time doom came out Was just so enormous.

361
00:23:33,168 --> 00:23:36,740
Scott: I think do no other game has had that kind of gap ever.

362
00:23:37,081 --> 00:23:40,132
Rym: I mean, they're they're definitely better games than do.

363
00:23:40,694 --> 00:23:49,880
Rym: I mean do was great and amazing But they're better come out like quick to was a gigantic like Revolution in gaming and half-life was a gigantic revolution FPS and all these sorts of things.

364
00:23:50,464 --> 00:23:52,779
Rym: But and you know Mario 64 and 3d platformer.

365
00:23:52,860 --> 00:24:01,980
Scott: But the gap between half-life and the other games that were out at the time Was not nearly as big as the gap between doom and the other games that came out at that time.

366
00:24:02,362 --> 00:24:11,297
Rym: I would argue that doom was possibly the biggest leap in gaming technology biggest individual leap ever in the history of gaming.

367
00:24:11,358 --> 00:24:13,744
Scott: by by Orders of magnitude.

368
00:24:14,406 --> 00:24:19,460
Rym: I mean looking at the games that I was playing when I then got the shareware of doom.

369
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:26,100
Scott: I mean you look at this video and they're talking about like commander keen and shit and then guy whips out do It's like holy fine?

370
00:24:26,503 --> 00:24:34,722
Scott: There are things in doom that you don't even notice nowadays That you don't realize how amazing they were like the facts that there was areas where lights turned on and off Yeah,

371
00:24:34,763 --> 00:24:38,003
Rym: dynamic lighting in 1993

372
00:24:38,003 --> 00:24:43,760
Scott: or the fact that it actually really looked 3d and you can go up and down in real time smoothly.

373
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,453
Rym: I mean quick to was this gigantic leap and quick through to.

374
00:24:47,573 --> 00:24:49,825
Scott: is the game the fact that bad guys would start shooting each other?

375
00:24:49,846 --> 00:24:56,540
Rym: I Credit quake to with beginning the true modern 3d FPS era, but it wasn't that big of a leap.

376
00:24:56,962 --> 00:25:00,760
Rym: Well, it was a big leap from doom, but there was that pesky quake one in between.

377
00:25:01,101 --> 00:25:02,989
Scott: Yeah, that sort of did the in-between leap.

378
00:25:03,391 --> 00:25:05,219
Rym: Yeah doom was just like.

379
00:25:06,243 --> 00:25:12,922
Rym: No game has ever been that amazing Compared to the other contemporary game you're really.

380
00:25:13,002 --> 00:25:14,067
Scott: if you don't get it.

381
00:25:14,187 --> 00:25:24,600
Scott: you need to watch this video and watch it carefully and Watch the whole thing slowly and carefully and let it sink in how much of a leap doom was in its day.

382
00:25:25,812 --> 00:25:29,759
Rym: so Completely not along those lines and not related at all.

383
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:38,498
Rym: I use this on a Tuesday as opposed to a Wednesday Partly because I'm sure a lot of the Wednesday listeners already see this sort of stuff all the time But I feel I should spread it.

384
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:41,772
Rym: I don't think I'm not going to explain who Hatsune Miku is.

385
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:43,720
Rym: you can you can look online and figure that out?

386
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:52,706
Rym: But we're fans and as long as she doesn't go all Macross on I was just about to say Of course if she does that's dumb.

387
00:25:53,328 --> 00:25:54,733
Rym: I can't really fault her for it.

388
00:25:54,974 --> 00:25:56,398
Scott: No, there's not much you can do about it.

389
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:59,632
Rym: Yeah Well, you can crash a plane and you don't have it.

390
00:25:59,652 --> 00:26:01,019
Scott: You don't have a transforming plane.

391
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,528
Rym: Anyway, I could take my one of my ring Raiders.

392
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:06,733
Scott: It's not gonna work.

393
00:26:06,753 --> 00:26:07,656
Rym: take it into the monitor.

394
00:26:07,797 --> 00:26:08,580
Scott: It'll just get owned.

395
00:26:10,005 --> 00:26:16,578
Rym: Anyway, so The long story short is that there's an old 60s duet by these cool Japanese.

396
00:26:16,638 --> 00:26:27,572
Rym: I'm using this and if you look any more info on this video, there's a link to that movie and This was redone by another set of Japanese twins more recently.

397
00:26:27,592 --> 00:26:30,340
Scott: I don't think they the more recent ones were twins.

398
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,446
Rym: Well, they're similar looking and they're cute.

399
00:26:32,707 --> 00:26:34,371
Rym: Yeah, that's that's all that really matters.

400
00:26:34,451 --> 00:26:43,939
Rym: Okay, so this has been taken to the third degree and Someone has made an animated Miku dance to this song and I don't just watch it.

401
00:26:44,261 --> 00:26:45,508
Rym: I don't think I need to say anything.

402
00:26:45,528 --> 00:26:46,212
Scott: Yeah, watch all these.

403
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,580
Scott: like there's three or four videos.

404
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,707
Scott: Just watch all of them and you'll understand what happened.

405
00:26:49,868 --> 00:26:50,610
Rym: It's it's cute.

406
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,072
Rym: It's cool.

407
00:26:51,172 --> 00:26:53,500
Rym: And I really really really like this song.

408
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,067
Scott: I was gonna say the songs pretty awesome.

409
00:26:55,087 --> 00:26:57,960
Scott: It is catchy and both the modern especially.

410
00:26:58,161 --> 00:27:01,659
Scott: I mean considering it's a Japanese song for the 60s and it's awesome.

411
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:02,603
Scott: now That's pretty.

412
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:04,652
Rym: Japanese music from the 60s is awesome.

413
00:27:04,732 --> 00:27:13,063
Scott: I say it wasn't but I'm just saying Considering that the fact that this song is like so awesome now is is less, you know It's a pretty damn good song.

414
00:27:13,163 --> 00:27:13,866
Rym: remake is good.

415
00:27:13,926 --> 00:27:15,049
Rym: But so is the original.

416
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:16,574
Rym: Yeah, and it's really cute.

417
00:27:16,895 --> 00:27:18,339
Rym: Okay, that's all I got.

418
00:27:18,983 --> 00:27:22,915
Scott: All right, we're gonna talk about scary games spooky game.

419
00:27:23,581 --> 00:27:27,840
Scott: So basically the edges boo, which is boo, which is which is brew is scary.

420
00:27:29,182 --> 00:27:29,947
Rym: Scott I got a question.

421
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:30,872
Scott: Yeah.

422
00:27:30,933 --> 00:27:32,059
Rym: Well, it's about which is.

423
00:27:36,275 --> 00:27:43,100
Scott: So Basically it's sort of come up that like, you know games aren't scary even games that want to be scary.

424
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,330
Scott: I mean, maybe other people are scared by them, but we definitely aren't.

425
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:53,552
Scott: you know games like eternal darkness resident evil Silent Hill These sort of games that are supposed to be scary are not scary.

426
00:27:53,853 --> 00:27:57,297
Scott: not at least not to us and you're scared by them You're a sissy.

427
00:27:58,925 --> 00:27:59,667
Rym: It will see.

428
00:27:59,728 --> 00:28:00,791
Rym: all these games are different.

429
00:28:00,811 --> 00:28:06,940
Rym: like Resident Evil went through this long evolution from What it was to what is basically a third-person zombie shooter.

430
00:28:07,101 --> 00:28:15,060
Scott: Yeah, actually like Resident Evil 4 more than I like the older ones Yeah, but I haven't played five but I'd like to but that's it's a third-person shooter.

431
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:15,884
Scott: Yeah, it is.

432
00:28:16,105 --> 00:28:19,040
Rym: but then there's games like Fatal Frame, which I would argue were a lot more scary.

433
00:28:19,421 --> 00:28:20,785
Scott: I know I didn't play that so I don't know.

434
00:28:21,227 --> 00:28:21,969
Rym: I only played it a little.

435
00:28:21,989 --> 00:28:25,400
Rym: I played most of Fatal Frame vicariously watching other.

436
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:29,135
Rym: Yeah, I never played that which is kind of how I enjoy those games.

437
00:28:29,175 --> 00:28:36,960
Scott: I never really liked playing them Right, but the thing is is like all these games that are supposed to be scary now I mean occasionally like they're like the first time I played eternal darkness.

438
00:28:37,362 --> 00:28:39,090
Scott: There are a couple parts that were jump out.

439
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,757
Scott: boo surprise like boo.

440
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,560
Scott: There's a body in a bloody bathtub, but it wasn't was the exam but it wasn't scary.

441
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:49,400
Scott: You know, I wasn't like you or you know, I didn't feel fear.

442
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,758
Scott: I just just like oh I jumped a little bit because it went boo right and that's not scary.

443
00:28:53,778 --> 00:28:54,220
Scott: That's just boo.

444
00:28:54,963 --> 00:28:57,271
Scott: So I realized that sort of like.

445
00:28:57,673 --> 00:29:02,740
Scott: I was scared of video games Way back in the day like for example.

446
00:29:02,961 --> 00:29:16,362
Scott: I think nothing is scared me as much as like the last level of Zelda 1 but I was also scared by like the entire second half or more than The majority of Zelda 2 and like towards the end of Megaman 2.

447
00:29:16,362 --> 00:29:18,154
Scott: I was getting a little scared when I was a little kid.

448
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:26,420
Scott: at least, you know It's like these old NES games are scarier and still are scared a lot of these games that try to be scary.

449
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:36,498
Scott: And I think there's a discussion to be had just in general about like what make games scary Why why one game scary and one isn't how to make a game scarier, etc.

450
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:43,882
Rym: I think we really need to break out because there are many different kinds of fear And I think for the purposes of a gaming discussion There are three.

451
00:29:44,585 --> 00:29:47,656
Rym: the first one obvious is the startle the jump out and boo the.

452
00:29:47,676 --> 00:29:49,705
Rym: I look in the bathtub There's nothing I like.

453
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:50,490
Rym: there's a bloody body.

454
00:29:50,591 --> 00:29:52,100
Scott: I don't even think that counts as scary.

455
00:29:53,221 --> 00:29:55,027
Rym: In video gaming that is definitely.

456
00:29:55,047 --> 00:29:58,940
Rym: it can be used to scare and it there is an element of fear.

457
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,321
Rym: It's just.

458
00:29:59,803 --> 00:30:01,689
Rym: it's a different kind of fear and it.

459
00:30:02,071 --> 00:30:03,455
Rym: I think it can be used effectively.

460
00:30:03,475 --> 00:30:04,840
Rym: I think it's usually overdone.

461
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:10,059
Rym: I think a lot of maybe try to be scary end up just being full of boo.

462
00:30:11,762 --> 00:30:19,400
Scott: Maybe so but personally When you know the boo feeling is nothing like a fear feeling for me.

463
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,300
Scott: So I sort of like I. when people make things they call them scary and they're actually just boo.

464
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,330
Scott: I sort of like no, you're not actually scary.

465
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:26,893
Scott: You're just boo.

466
00:30:27,013 --> 00:30:29,265
Scott: It's it's not you're cheating It's not the same thing.

467
00:30:29,325 --> 00:30:32,140
Rym: I think for the purposes of this discussion that it really fits.

468
00:30:32,763 --> 00:30:35,295
Rym: I think it's one of the three kinds of scaring.

469
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:38,067
Rym: startling fear, you know It's an aspect of this kind of game.

470
00:30:38,609 --> 00:30:41,400
Scott: It is an aspect of the kind of game, but I think it's not scary.

471
00:30:42,932 --> 00:30:44,314
Rym: I would say it definitely counts.

472
00:30:44,394 --> 00:30:46,097
Rym: It's one of the three pillars of scary.

473
00:30:46,197 --> 00:30:47,239
Scott: Well doesn't scare me.

474
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:54,360
Rym: Well Maybe this is a no-true Scotsman situation, but possibly sure it falls in the realm of scaring.

475
00:30:55,481 --> 00:30:57,472
Rym: Startle is just another kind of scare.

476
00:30:57,492 --> 00:30:58,800
Rym: It has a different reaction.

477
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:10,760
Rym: I I guess the point I'm trying to make that you keep desperately trying to derail with your semantic bullshit Is that there are different kinds of fear different kinds of scaring and different sorts of feelings?

478
00:31:10,861 --> 00:31:25,979
Rym: You can evoke along these lines but I feel like most game designers don't necessarily differentiate between them and just kind of make games with these stereotypical things that they that should be scary.

479
00:31:25,999 --> 00:31:29,852
Rym: and Sometimes they touch on the elements of one kind of fear and sometimes on the other.

480
00:31:29,872 --> 00:31:38,240
Rym: and I think this alone accounts for just 90% of the disparity between What games scare people and what games try to be scary?

481
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:43,431
Rym: But aren't in games that don't try to be scary but are and all that sort of thing I just I don't think people really analyze.

482
00:31:43,491 --> 00:31:44,215
Rym: What is scary?

483
00:31:44,717 --> 00:31:45,260
Scott: Yeah, they're dead.

484
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,632
Scott: You know, it's like a lot of people.

485
00:31:47,652 --> 00:31:49,280
Scott: you just go up to someone say what's scary?

486
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:54,320
Scott: Well zombies monsters goes things that are ugly things are nasty things that are dark.

487
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,595
Scott: You go to other people who are being quiet then jumping out and going boom.

488
00:31:57,615 --> 00:32:01,760
Rym: Okay, you go to other people What's scary and they say AIDS the Holocaust?

489
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,450
Scott: Yeah, those are scary.

490
00:32:03,511 --> 00:32:06,430
Scott: your mom Your mom is pretty scary.

491
00:32:06,751 --> 00:32:08,017
Rym: Yeah, not as scary as your mom.

492
00:32:08,077 --> 00:32:22,293
Rym: Yeah, but Startling I think is one but I think the much more interesting second kind but the kind that is most often Conflated with fear in general is the mundane fear the meta fear.

493
00:32:23,396 --> 00:32:38,357
Rym: I guess the example I have for this is Remember games like Final Fantasy where you have to fight your way in and get the floater and fight your way out And if you die or get lost or fuck up You have to go through all that all over again because you couldn't save your game.

494
00:32:38,418 --> 00:32:38,920
Scott: Oh, that's true.

495
00:32:38,961 --> 00:32:40,039
Scott: I mean games today.

496
00:32:40,361 --> 00:32:46,800
Scott: They don't really punish the player very much because you know that sort of makes the games very frustrating and no one likes them.

497
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,960
Scott: So even a game that's supposed to be scary usually doesn't punish you.

498
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,684
Scott: I mean Resident Evil.

499
00:32:51,705 --> 00:32:54,120
Scott: lets you save on the typewriters all over the place, right?

500
00:32:54,901 --> 00:33:08,026
Scott: So, I mean if a game doesn't you mean even if a game isn't supposed to be scary if the game has a serious Punishment for failure then failure suddenly becomes very very frightening if you know that there's that extreme punishment.

501
00:33:08,409 --> 00:33:17,526
Rym: but at the same time punishment and meta fear are This almost logical Calculated controlled fear.

502
00:33:17,647 --> 00:33:20,296
Rym: It's not like it's not this visceral feeling.

503
00:33:20,336 --> 00:33:21,340
Rym: It's this very literal.

504
00:33:22,122 --> 00:33:29,405
Rym: I don't want to have to play through the part of the game that I just played again feeling it's this calculated Oh my god, and

505
00:33:30,128 --> 00:33:35,892
Scott: but I mean if you're Mario and you're there's a big hole and you got to jump over it You're actually afraid to fall down it.

506
00:33:35,912 --> 00:33:40,220
Scott: Whereas if you can just load it up again You're not afraid to fall down it and go just jump with no fear.

507
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:45,996
Rym: But while you're afraid on this calculated meta level, you're not afraid on this human visceral level.

508
00:33:46,036 --> 00:33:55,026
Rym: You're not like Imagining yourself as Mario fearing this bottomless chasm you have to jump over Not trembling.

509
00:33:55,047 --> 00:33:56,150
Rym: no, you're not.

510
00:33:56,351 --> 00:33:56,491
Rym: it's.

511
00:33:56,832 --> 00:33:58,156
Rym: it's this very meta fear.

512
00:33:58,257 --> 00:33:59,180
Scott: if you are you need help.

513
00:33:59,682 --> 00:34:00,928
Rym: It's the shit.

514
00:34:00,988 --> 00:34:07,060
Rym: and I think the problem I had with eternal darkness Was that it really only had these first two kinds of fear.

515
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:13,760
Rym: It was primarily either boo or meta and the meta was always either, you know, you walk into a room.

516
00:34:14,143 --> 00:34:16,159
Rym: You think you died crap up?

517
00:34:16,324 --> 00:34:19,917
Rym: No I didn't die or I'm gonna spoil because it statute of limitations.

518
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:29,860
Rym: seriously The point near the end of the game where if your sanity meter gets low enough You go to save your game and then it's just like up format error and then your save game disappears.

519
00:34:30,108 --> 00:34:39,362
Scott: Well, no There was a part I think towards the middle ish latest part of the game where it popped up like the GameCube error message like got your game screwed up and then I was Like aha just kidding.

520
00:34:39,864 --> 00:34:41,871
Rym: Yep, but that scared me.

521
00:34:42,652 --> 00:34:43,074
Rym: It got me.

522
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:43,897
Rym: I was like what.

523
00:34:44,277 --> 00:34:45,924
Scott: I wasn't scared I was just pissed.

524
00:34:45,965 --> 00:34:47,150
Scott: I was like off fuck.

525
00:34:47,793 --> 00:34:53,043
Rym: I wasn't like oh god But that is fair, but it's the pure Metalogical fear.

526
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,051
Rym: you don't have the visceral like.

527
00:34:55,292 --> 00:35:11,240
Rym: you don't get that spine tingling that like Incomprehensible primal feeling of fear that that are actually afraid and it doesn't have to be fear in the like Whoo, but just that you know every now and then you're you're all at least most of you human.

528
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:14,840
Rym: Everyone has felt that kind of visceral.

529
00:35:15,242 --> 00:35:17,309
Rym: You don't have any logical reason to be afraid.

530
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:20,743
Scott: the same feeling you have when like you're a kid you're afraid of dark There's.

531
00:35:21,044 --> 00:35:22,873
Rym: there's no guy with a gun.

532
00:35:23,114 --> 00:35:24,502
Rym: or even if there is a guy with a gun That's.

533
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:25,920
Rym: there's a logical fear of that.

534
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:30,914
Rym: But the the kind of primal there is nothing to actually be afraid of.

535
00:35:31,315 --> 00:35:33,948
Rym: but you are having a physiological reaction.

536
00:35:33,968 --> 00:35:41,447
Rym: your body Feels this certain visceral primal urge to flee That you can't control.

537
00:35:41,467 --> 00:35:43,877
Rym: and even if you can control it and you can still feel it.

538
00:35:44,178 --> 00:35:50,200
Rym: It's there And people feel it to different degrees and everyone has different kind of ways to deal with it, but it's there.

539
00:35:50,521 --> 00:36:01,045
Rym: it's part of being an organism that reacts to stimuli in a solid cystic world and all that stuff, but I feel like very few games ever have consciously tapped that.

540
00:36:01,065 --> 00:36:04,315
Rym: a lot of games have tapped it by accident like I think.

541
00:36:04,355 --> 00:36:11,040
Rym: I do feel that Zelda 1 Tapped it for some reason with Ganon's dungeon in the end, and I don't think it was intentional.

542
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:14,428
Scott: I think a lot of it definitely It's like I try to figure out why.

543
00:36:14,508 --> 00:36:15,131
Scott: right cuz it's like.

544
00:36:15,151 --> 00:36:20,616
Scott: well if I'm gonna complain about Resident Evil and stuff not being Scary right why was all the one that last dungeon?

545
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:21,380
Scott: Why was it scary?

546
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:21,821
Scott: You know what?

547
00:36:21,841 --> 00:36:23,046
Scott: it wasn't just the last dungeon.

548
00:36:23,066 --> 00:36:26,318
Scott: It was that whole northwest corner of the map was scary.

549
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:28,906
Rym: You know On a good example Zelda to.

550
00:36:28,926 --> 00:36:30,091
Rym: you know keep going along the Zelda's.

551
00:36:30,433 --> 00:36:35,654
Rym: Zelda 2 is a pretty good game And the the hammer plays had this metaphor of fuck.

552
00:36:35,674 --> 00:36:38,680
Scott: the hammer place is pretty scary Yeah, but that was mostly meta.

553
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:39,927
Rym: It was fuck.

554
00:36:40,048 --> 00:36:40,953
Rym: I have to do this again.

555
00:36:40,973 --> 00:36:42,963
Rym: that took me like four hours Mostly the game.

556
00:36:43,004 --> 00:36:45,315
Scott: as soon as you took the raft over to the other island.

557
00:36:45,475 --> 00:36:48,327
Scott: everything was scary Super scary all the time.

558
00:36:48,407 --> 00:36:49,872
Rym: It was almost like and it wasn't.

559
00:36:50,254 --> 00:36:51,980
Rym: it wasn't strong fear.

560
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,949
Rym: It wasn't the like you drop.

561
00:36:53,969 --> 00:36:55,014
Rym: the controller wasn't.

562
00:36:55,174 --> 00:37:00,120
Scott: it wasn't super strong But it was constantly ever-present, and it was real fear.

563
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,810
Scott: It's the kind of fear that I was looking for.

564
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:03,500
Scott: that isn't in these other games.

565
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,966
Scott: It should be in but it still.

566
00:37:05,187 --> 00:37:05,789
Rym: it was weak.

567
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:06,733
Rym: It was a very.

568
00:37:06,774 --> 00:37:07,216
Rym: it was like.

569
00:37:07,778 --> 00:37:09,502
Rym: there's this Something.

570
00:37:09,522 --> 00:37:26,397
Rym: some aspect of the game either by design or by chance touched just briefly just barely Infinitesimally on some factor that causes primal fear and at least some humans Mm-hmm, and I can't think of games very few games that have done that.

571
00:37:26,819 --> 00:37:29,201
Scott: yeah This is not too many But

572
00:37:29,482 --> 00:37:46,439
Rym: I we I've been trying to think about games that caused that feeling even for a second and I realized that almost every case Seems to either have something to do with the uncanny valley like something just isn't quite right or Something is unpredictable in an unexpected way.

573
00:37:47,288 --> 00:37:48,922
Rym: Not not in the unpredictable You know.

574
00:37:48,942 --> 00:37:52,380
Rym: the monster moves in this random pattern that I can't figure out.

575
00:37:52,460 --> 00:38:00,117
Rym: but like if you're playing a game like Castlevania 2 and The game glitches and you end up in just this weird space in the game.

576
00:38:00,197 --> 00:38:00,840
Rym: You can't get out.

577
00:38:01,322 --> 00:38:05,020
Rym: There's this feat there's this slight alien feeling that something's wrong.

578
00:38:05,602 --> 00:38:10,584
Rym: Mm-hmm kind of like how in the uncanny valley where if something's fake enough It doesn't bother you.

579
00:38:10,865 --> 00:38:18,105
Rym: something real enough doesn't bother you if something's almost real almost together But it's just a little bit off.

580
00:38:18,627 --> 00:38:22,337
Rym: It's like humans are like on a hair trigger to feel something is wrong.

581
00:38:22,377 --> 00:38:23,320
Rym: with that as a result.

582
00:38:23,561 --> 00:38:27,134
Scott: Yeah, it's like and I try to think about like, you know these games like.

583
00:38:27,214 --> 00:38:28,820
Scott: what was what was up with them, right?

584
00:38:29,423 --> 00:38:44,707
Scott: and you know The music and Zelda in the last level of Zelda 1 definitely was a Contributor right the fact that the bad guys were really dangerous in The end of Zelda 1 and in the second half of Zelda 2 that was a contributor Primarily

585
00:38:44,747 --> 00:38:45,632
Rym: on meta fear there.

586
00:38:45,914 --> 00:38:46,075
Rym: Yeah.

587
00:38:46,095 --> 00:38:46,317
Scott: Yeah.

588
00:38:47,682 --> 00:38:53,740
Scott: But you know also if you look at Zelda 2 right when you're on that first island think about the bad guys, right?

589
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,430
Scott: You know this their staff losses.

590
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:57,935
Scott: They look alright, you know Moblins.

591
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:03,920
Scott: Moblins look just fine, you know little slugs your little slimes that are you know, perfectly rendered, right?

592
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,006
Scott: You go to the other island, right?

593
00:39:06,348 --> 00:39:09,840
Scott: And first of all the grass over there isn't clean shiny grass.

594
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,908
Scott: It's sort of like got all this crap all over it.

595
00:39:11,989 --> 00:39:16,647
Scott: and like the bad guys that you got those guys like those bugs with The extending legs that bounce up and down.

596
00:39:16,668 --> 00:39:22,169
Scott: Yeah, and like they're a little bit sort of shaky Right, and they're sort of pixely and not clearly defined.

597
00:39:22,209 --> 00:39:31,720
Rym: and then like a lot of these those like weird bugs It was kind of come down and move in this really like weird Methodical pattern that didn't fit the way a thing would fly.

598
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:31,961
Rym: It was.

599
00:39:32,424 --> 00:39:34,840
Rym: there was a lot of uncanny valley kind of stuff going on there.

600
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:43,040
Scott: Yeah, and then like you look at like some of the map areas It's like the in the second half and it's like it just wasn't as well.

601
00:39:43,241 --> 00:39:59,600
Scott: It's like it felt like someone took real care in like, you know Well doing a really good design and that first half of the game But the second half of the game it feels like a lot of the design isn't so perfect, you know Like for example, is that spirally part in the mountains, right?

602
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:22,387
Scott: but like one hallway is like three wide and other ones too wide and it's like it just sort of Thrown together a little bit and I think that it's just little things like that things that you don't you know consciously notice It's just you know, it's the kind of thing where someone making a game today, you know If you made one hallway wide and the other ones sort of narrow and it looks sort of broken like that Like it was just sort of it.

603
00:40:22,427 --> 00:40:26,608
Scott: look it looks like someone screwed up doing the art, you know It doesn't look like it's supposed to be that way.

604
00:40:26,628 --> 00:40:28,819
Scott: It's like hey you fucked up fix it, you know.

605
00:40:30,001 --> 00:40:38,260
Scott: But I think that that sort of thing is actually contributes to you know, the real fear I'm sort of like this, you know subconscious level

606
00:40:38,721 --> 00:41:02,022
Rym: I think part of it and I feel strongly about this is the idea that a game that has this sort of consistency and Expectations the world is created and defined and it works around you in some way and like in the first part of Zelda 2 everything is very clean and together and orderly and there's roads between all the places and you get this sort of comfortable feeling.

607
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:10,400
Rym: you have expectations about what should be and everything is in its place and everything works and Then suddenly you're confronted with a place where that's not true.

608
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:16,880
Rym: You've been lulled into the sense of security and expectations and then one by one All of those expectations are kind of pulled out from under you.

609
00:41:16,986 --> 00:41:24,603
Scott: Yeah You've got nice safe roads connecting all the town to good examples in Zelda 2 and in Dragon Warrior 1.

610
00:41:24,603 --> 00:41:31,760
Rym: You find eventually a place That should be one way that is very strongly not a town in Zelda 2.

611
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,511
Rym: There is a town that if you go into it, there are no people.

612
00:41:34,852 --> 00:41:46,060
Rym: there are just invisible monsters that kill you Mmm, but up until that point in almost every game you played not in just that game But in all games like that towns were the safe places where you go and save your game.

613
00:41:46,563 --> 00:41:51,478
Rym: It's like if in a Final Fantasy game you go into the end You save your game go to the end save your game.

614
00:41:52,101 --> 00:41:59,187
Rym: One in you go into you go to save your game and there's no one to save your game in that it There's just like a dead guy.

615
00:41:59,327 --> 00:42:02,500
Scott: Let me think it can even be even simpler stuff than that, right?

616
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:06,235
Scott: I mean think about this right, you know, you're playing say a Mario game, right?

617
00:42:06,456 --> 00:42:07,380
Scott: What colors of Goomba?

618
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:10,680
Scott: It's it's brown with a white face and blue feet, right?

619
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:13,149
Scott: Well, you go into it someplace.

620
00:42:13,169 --> 00:42:16,200
Scott: It's like well you got like there's a black Goomba, you know.

621
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:19,892
Scott: I mean if you portray the black Goomba just you know not as you know.

622
00:42:20,013 --> 00:42:24,694
Scott: cute like it, you know could be but you could Portray that Goomba in such a way, you know, someone comes in.

623
00:42:24,714 --> 00:42:25,679
Scott: It's like oh shit black Goomba.

624
00:42:26,011 --> 00:42:29,130
Rym: No if you just made the Goomba's black in one level that doesn't do it.

625
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:37,239
Rym: or if you if you build up to the Goomba if you like I think partly it's the unexpected the unexplained and the nonsensical.

626
00:42:37,259 --> 00:42:42,300
Rym: if In one of the places there's just one black Goomba that's like all the other Goombas.

627
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:47,639
Rym: It just looks different and that's the only one and there's no explanation and you never run into it again.

628
00:42:48,644 --> 00:42:50,002
Rym: that Triggers.

629
00:42:50,022 --> 00:42:51,448
Rym: that's feeling just a little bit.

630
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:57,860
Scott: Yeah tiny bit just a tiny time Mario You know, it doesn't have the design to do it so well.

631
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,373
Scott: But you know, it's that kind of idea or like.

632
00:43:00,393 --> 00:43:01,780
Rym: I brought this up before too.

633
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:14,873
Rym: But I remember I read some article about how the key to making Scary bosses or scary monsters in games is to make them be unpredictable in a visceral way or unpredictable in a way That isn't in and of itself predictable.

634
00:43:15,316 --> 00:43:20,060
Scott: that might sound dumb But let me think about pretty much every boss has a pattern every single one.

635
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,404
Scott: I mean what boss doesn't have a.

636
00:43:21,424 --> 00:43:26,180
Rym: they can act randomly, but you sort of start to expect them to go in a certain way.

637
00:43:26,581 --> 00:43:29,732
Scott: But I mean even if they're acting randomly, they're select.

638
00:43:29,752 --> 00:43:32,220
Scott: they're randomly selecting from a set list of moves.

639
00:43:32,521 --> 00:43:33,826
Scott: So, you know what moves they have.

640
00:43:33,966 --> 00:43:38,081
Scott: so it doesn't matter if they choose this move three times and that move two times You know what?

641
00:43:38,101 --> 00:43:49,200
Scott: All the moves are and they give signals as to what move they're about to do which now I'm not saying the game shouldn't be that way because for a game Especially like Castlevania if you don't want a game to be scary don't make it scary.

642
00:43:49,441 --> 00:43:54,040
Rym: Not only that but if you don't make the bosses telegraph their moves then it's basically just like impossible.

643
00:43:54,281 --> 00:43:56,710
Rym: Yeah, as opposed to half reaction half puzzle

644
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:57,292
Scott: exactly,

645
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:24,938
Rym: but if you can make it Unpredictable, I think if every now and then things just going away that you can't possibly expect not necessarily just to kill you but just unexpected like if the monster turns away and Regards something else or runs away from you inexplicably or just does something that takes you a back That that's odd that we may not do it in and of itself But I think that's on the road to bringing that feeling out.

646
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:35,293
Scott: Mmm just doing more things like that, you know things that make you you know feel like, you know, oh shit this You know, I mean you go into like different areas in a game, right?

647
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:35,876
Scott: It's like, okay.

648
00:44:35,896 --> 00:44:38,599
Scott: This is a different area Okay, now I'm in a different area, right?

649
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:51,307
Scott: But there's sort of like when you go to that last level and it's all to one it's like there's that this is it Feeling you know, it's like that knowledge that this is it and a lot of games I think don't actually have the this.

650
00:44:51,387 --> 00:44:55,160
Scott: is it because you know, they keep coming on with the square bosses and stuff like that.

651
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:55,965
Scott: Right because it was like.

652
00:44:56,207 --> 00:44:57,879
Scott: you don't really know when you're at the end of the game.

653
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,748
Rym: Well, you know if you sometimes you do.

654
00:44:59,788 --> 00:45:03,042
Rym: you've already beaten the main boss, you know, there's one more boss That's true.

655
00:45:03,503 --> 00:45:09,000
Scott: But I mean, you know, a lot of games don't do a very good job of being like this is it?

656
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,370
Scott: You know, they don't want to let you know that this is really.

657
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:13,560
Scott: this part is the end part, you know.

658
00:45:14,861 --> 00:45:24,787
Rym: but then look at like Castlevania to the Right, but like the whole game is kind of consistent up to a point right before the end of the game you get before Dracula's castle.

659
00:45:25,049 --> 00:45:29,472
Rym: there's a town like every other town But the bricks are all gray and you've never seen that before.

660
00:45:30,014 --> 00:45:32,426
Rym: and there's no one in the town No one.

661
00:45:32,467 --> 00:45:35,223
Rym: you go into the church all the buildings No one.

662
00:45:35,584 --> 00:45:39,034
Rym: you find secret passages in some of the houses nothing in them.

663
00:45:39,235 --> 00:45:44,406
Rym: you go all the way down multiple levels Sometimes in the secret passage another secret passage There's just nothing.

664
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:51,280
Rym: in one of the houses in the secret passage You find one person sitting there by themselves and all they say is please stay with me.

665
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,100
Rym: Yeah, it's kind of creepy.

666
00:45:54,841 --> 00:46:04,880
Rym: so then you leave that town and then next is this bridge and then Dracula's castle and When you go in it plays music, you've never heard before, you know, this is like the Castlevania theme.

667
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,765
Rym: Yeah, and there's nothing there.

668
00:46:06,846 --> 00:46:11,580
Rym: and for five minutes you just walk and walk and walk down and down and down and down.

669
00:46:12,001 --> 00:46:15,256
Rym: There's nothing there and then at the end there's nothing.

670
00:46:15,296 --> 00:46:16,200
Rym: there's just an altar.

671
00:46:16,762 --> 00:46:20,500
Rym: You brought Dracula with you and then you resurrect him in the basement.

672
00:46:21,116 --> 00:46:29,467
Rym: Yeah That again that I'm not gonna try to say that that is scarier than Fatal Frame I don't think it is.

673
00:46:29,889 --> 00:46:43,420
Rym: but what I think it does it's also not a very good game No, but I think that that game because of its glitchiness and just that last bit Also goes down the road of what could be a viscerally scary game.

674
00:46:43,521 --> 00:46:45,740
Scott: I mean, that's another thing is a glitchiness is scary.

675
00:46:46,001 --> 00:47:11,629
Scott: Metroid 1 has a lot of scariness going on just because of its glitchiness, you know and I think that when you make a game Even if you try to make it scary with monsters and zombies and Cthulhu's and ghosts and boo and whatever you got in there Right, if you should make the game glitchy, but even like, you know eternal darkness again with its insanity meter Right appearing to be glitchy It's fake glitchiness and people can tell.

676
00:47:12,191 --> 00:47:15,140
Scott: people can tell when it's real glitchiness and when it's fake glitchiness.

677
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:17,387
Scott: I don't think you can fake real glitchiness.

678
00:47:17,428 --> 00:47:24,450
Scott: I think you just need to make a glitchy ass game to make it scary and I Have a lot of ideas.

679
00:47:24,571 --> 00:47:25,640
Rym: I feel like we should cut this short.

680
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:29,700
Rym: We've already got really but I I we came up with we were talking about this.

681
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:34,360
Rym: I think we have a really good idea for what could be a scary game.

682
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:38,340
Scott: But yeah, I definitely think one key though is don't polish the games.

683
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:40,509
Scott: Don't do things that you're supposed to do.

684
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:44,168
Scott: don't make the graphic design consistent Don't you know.

685
00:47:44,449 --> 00:47:46,180
Scott: don't make the game well-designed, you know.

686
00:47:46,361 --> 00:47:56,449
Scott: Make it a little crappy in a few places because some of the scariest things are the things that leave a few glitches in there That aren't showstoppers that make the game actually break Just don't make sense at all.

687
00:47:56,569 --> 00:48:05,840
Rym: and because things might not make sense from a realistic standpoint But they make sense in the context of the game or even if not in the game in the context of video games.

688
00:48:06,502 --> 00:48:11,480
Rym: But if you have things that don't make sense in any of those contexts, they're just there.

689
00:48:12,463 --> 00:48:19,760
Scott: That's on the road again Mm-hmm, and I feel like just like usually here's an example before we cut this out, right?

690
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:24,360
Scott: You know, usually, you know, there's the Chekhov's gun scooby-doo type of thing, right?

691
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:31,440
Scott: You know, we're like, you know They'll put some some sort of graphic that you haven't seen anywhere else and it stands out from the background.

692
00:48:31,862 --> 00:48:34,759
Scott: So obviously it's supposed to do something or it's special in some way.

693
00:48:35,921 --> 00:48:39,695
Scott: But I mean some a lot of games a lot of NES games in certain places.

694
00:48:39,735 --> 00:48:42,760
Scott: They would have things like that But they wouldn't do anything.

695
00:48:42,923 --> 00:48:43,656
Scott: They would just be there.

696
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:49,949
Scott: But then and you'd sit there trying to play with it or whatever and like depending on the game though It might sort of freak you out.

697
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:52,302
Scott: Like you think it might do something Yeah,

698
00:48:52,884 --> 00:49:00,900
Rym: but then like look at a lot of the scary games now where you walk by the window and you just you know Something's gonna jump through the window exactly, but then they switch it up and something jumps from behind the window.

699
00:49:03,481 --> 00:49:18,103
Rym: But I guess in closing that the best thing I think you could do to make a scary game that I've never seen anyone really do is One have everything be well-lit and not scary Completely, you know normal well-lit defined.

700
00:49:18,485 --> 00:49:23,277
Rym: not you know resident evilly or eternal darkness not dark gray and brown.

701
00:49:23,879 --> 00:50:00,459
Rym: but to You have to engender this false sense of security this false set of expectations this false set of like this false context for the world and Establish all these norms and guidelines and rules to where the person like things make sense in the game and then one by one After after a while you have to start pulling the rug out from under each and every one of these expectations and video games can do this more so than a lot of other ways to scare people because The person you know as a human you're looking at a 3d world say it's a first-person view game.

702
00:50:01,364 --> 00:50:09,180
Rym: You have all these expectations and Metacontacts that you're bringing with you because you live in a 3d world and you see it in the first person.

703
00:50:09,682 --> 00:50:11,532
Rym: you expect things to work in a certain way.

704
00:50:12,135 --> 00:50:24,400
Rym: you could make a House a small house that is actually non-euclidean in a video game that you make four left And you don't end up where you started again, but yet it doesn't look like you did anything weird.

705
00:50:24,701 --> 00:50:25,425
Scott: Yeah, I mean you know.

706
00:50:25,445 --> 00:50:28,681
Scott: think about say Resident Evil 1 right and Resident Evil 1.

707
00:50:28,681 --> 00:50:31,351
Scott: You know every door goes to where you think it goes.

708
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:32,816
Scott: you know I mean you have a map.

709
00:50:32,857 --> 00:50:33,700
Scott: the map is correct.

710
00:50:34,381 --> 00:50:42,859
Scott: What if like you went in a door and you just ended up in some other room and then you went back through the door You ended up some other room that thought not the one you came from and you just like what the fuck?

711
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,813
Scott: Yep, but you know and that thing is okay.

712
00:50:45,853 --> 00:50:56,399
Scott: if you do it all the time Then people are just like oh well You know I guess every door just takes me someplace random whatever What if you just did it once did it like once and if you go back through the door it never happens again?

713
00:50:56,660 --> 00:51:03,819
Scott: Yep, ever and you just and you do things a whole bunch of different things once each.

714
00:51:04,321 --> 00:51:10,220
Scott: But even then because in general the game is still playable right because it's just these weird things only happen once each.

715
00:51:10,641 --> 00:51:18,163
Scott: But as a whole those things combine to make the player very uneasy psychologically, but even then there's the jarring disconnect.

716
00:51:18,685 --> 00:51:21,313
Rym: video game wise video game context when you go through a door.

717
00:51:21,814 --> 00:51:32,669
Rym: going through a door is Contextualized in video games as the expectation that there could be a teleportation that you're moving to a different zone That you're not in this one contiguous three-dimensional space.

718
00:51:33,652 --> 00:51:39,153
Rym: in a first-person continuous game without loading screens You could do this within the same room as in.

719
00:51:39,595 --> 00:52:14,730
Rym: I look to the right I see you know a fireplace with a mantle over it and a portrait and like some candles on the On the mantle and I kind of look away and I'll do something else and I look back in the course of doing my other thing and One of the candles is missing or it's lit or the portrait slightly different not obvious things just subtle disconnection subtle Decontextualization subtle things that break your expectations, but otherwise have no effect or that Maybe we'll have an effect later like you'll like.

720
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:16,676
Rym: maybe the portrait changed and you don't realize it.

721
00:52:17,038 --> 00:52:21,813
Rym: later in the game Something happens that make you realize way back that the portrait change.

722
00:52:21,973 --> 00:52:22,636
Scott: Well, how about this?

723
00:52:22,716 --> 00:52:24,000
Scott: right you walk into a room, right?

724
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:24,964
Scott: It's a square room.

725
00:52:25,285 --> 00:52:27,654
Scott: You're facing north right on the north wall.

726
00:52:27,694 --> 00:52:29,160
Scott: You see the fireplace, right?

727
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,388
Scott: You turn to face the east wall.

728
00:52:31,568 --> 00:52:32,211
Scott: There's a door.

729
00:52:32,874 --> 00:52:34,180
Scott: you turn to face the north wall.

730
00:52:34,744 --> 00:52:35,429
Scott: There's a door.

731
00:52:35,812 --> 00:52:36,880
Scott: you turn to face the west wall.

732
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:37,565
Scott: There's a fireplace.

733
00:52:37,606 --> 00:52:39,500
Scott: the fireplace moves from the north wall to the west wall.

734
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:42,700
Scott: You can make and then the fireplace just remains on the west wall forever.

735
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:46,190
Scott: So it's like was I really look what and you can.

737
00:52:47,354 --> 00:52:49,380
Scott: the fireplace forever is now on the west wall.

738
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:50,706
Scott: It never moves back to the north wall.

739
00:52:50,726 --> 00:52:55,722
Rym: I mean things can be continuously and subtly Disconcerting you.

740
00:52:56,022 --> 00:53:02,560
Rym: you can turn 90 degrees to the left, but that 90-degree turn takes a hundred and twenty degrees worth of turning.

741
00:53:03,343 --> 00:53:03,966
Scott: Oh, you could do that.

742
00:53:03,986 --> 00:53:05,232
