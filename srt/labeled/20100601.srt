1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,896
Rym: Hey, it's Tuesday, June 1st.

2
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:11,658
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:12,360
Rym: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,664
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:13,704 --> 00:00:18,153
Rym: We had a little trouble doing the opener just now, but tonight we're gonna talk about Zularetto.

6
00:00:18,253 --> 00:00:20,704
Rym: It's like Russian roulette, but it's a board game with animals.

7
00:00:20,725 --> 00:00:21,890
Scott: So many words in the opener.

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,208
Scott: Let's do this.

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,084
Rym: So, playing my Street Fighter.

10
00:00:30,204 --> 00:00:33,314
Rym: Getting slowly, but surely better, but not that great.

11
00:00:33,595 --> 00:00:35,260
Rym: I haven't beaten the game on medium yet.

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,864
Scott: Yeah, oh really?

13
00:00:37,105 --> 00:00:38,269
Rym: Yeah, I haven't tried too hard.

14
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:39,674
Rym: I've tried like four times.

15
00:00:39,734 --> 00:00:41,180
Scott: I beat the game on hard disk.

16
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:45,920
Scott: Right yesterday, and you know what I learned from Daryl Surratt today?

17
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,519
Rym: What'd you learn from Daryl Surratt today?

18
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,870
Scott: My suspicion is correct, and that basically the computer cheats.

19
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,000
Scott: So, playing against the computer is not good if you want to get good against people.

20
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:59,886
Rym: Dude, I read some interview where one of the guys who developed or something said something along the lines of, "Yeah, we made that guy as annoying and cheap as

21
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:00,267
Rym: possible.".

22
00:01:00,307 --> 00:01:04,500
Scott: Basically, right, the computer, the way it cheats is it looks at your inputs, right?

23
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:09,056
Scott: So, you know, think about a human being, right, probably isn't looking at your hands.

24
00:01:09,077 --> 00:01:09,960
Scott: They gotta look at the screen.

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,521
Scott: Are you kidding?

26
00:01:10,702 --> 00:01:18,019
Rym: If I'm looking at the screen and I hear on your stick next to you, "Kuh-kuh-kuh-kuh-kuh-kuh-kuh-kuh-kuh-kuh" or, "Hadokan, I know you're doing a

27
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:18,520
Rym: Hadokan!".

28
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,181
Scott: But think about it.

29
00:01:19,242 --> 00:01:26,377
Scott: The amount of time it takes for the sound to get to your ears or whatever, versus the human reaction time is no good.

30
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,684
Scott: Now, think about the computer though.

31
00:01:29,865 --> 00:01:31,832
Scott: I input a move, right?

32
00:01:32,474 --> 00:01:35,303
Scott: And as soon as I input the move, move, right?

33
00:01:35,885 --> 00:01:39,617
Scott: Me putting in the Hadouken can trigger on, right?

34
00:01:39,637 --> 00:01:41,764
Scott: Cause it can do something as fast as I put it in.

35
00:01:41,824 --> 00:01:48,529
Scott: So my, me doing a Hadouken can immediately trigger a counter to the Hadouken at the same exact moment.

36
00:01:49,613 --> 00:01:51,901
Scott: The computer can do that, that a human cannot do.

37
00:01:51,981 --> 00:02:00,013
Scott: And basically when you play the game on hardest difficulty, the game is Bay is pretty much really easy right through the whole game.

38
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,383
Scott: I just beat everybody beat win, win, win, win, win, win.

39
00:02:02,785 --> 00:02:03,871
Rym: They're beating everybody.

40
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:09,515
Scott: But as soon as you get to Seth, basically they spent all their time programming him to be ultra cheap.

41
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:15,236
Scott: So basically what happens is it watches all of your moves and counters them immediately, right?

42
00:02:15,316 --> 00:02:20,253
Scott: With whatever is available and it's next to impossible to actually win.

43
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:25,095
Scott: And basically I use no continues and I got the set and I use like a whole flood of continues.

44
00:02:25,115 --> 00:02:28,211
Rym: And then eventually I want to be interesting if we could make a little app, right?

45
00:02:28,251 --> 00:02:29,437
Rym: That would, it was USB.

46
00:02:29,477 --> 00:02:40,380
Rym: So it controls like it's controlling our controller and a webcam pointed at the other guy playing and seeing if you could write some sort of AI or some sort of algorithm to do the same thing.

47
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,715
Scott: The thing is you couldn't react as immediately, right?

48
00:02:43,735 --> 00:02:43,936
Rym: No, no, no.

49
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:45,565
Rym: You write a program that does the reaction.

50
00:02:45,927 --> 00:02:47,818
Scott: Yeah, it's like, but I mean, you know, the same thing.

51
00:02:47,858 --> 00:02:53,882
Scott: It's like if a guy does Hadouken, even if I have a camera and I see split screen, his joystick and his hands, right.

52
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:56,953
Scott: And somehow my brain can process and see what he's doing.

53
00:02:57,435 --> 00:03:02,512
Scott: I can't input something at the same exact nanosecond that he is inputted it.

54
00:03:02,793 --> 00:03:05,684
Scott: There is some delay between him doing it and me doing it.

55
00:03:05,704 --> 00:03:13,098
Scott: Whereas the computer, there is no delay because the second you push the punch button on the Hadouken, it doesn't need time to input moves.

56
00:03:13,118 --> 00:03:17,412
Scott: It doesn't need to think it just, Oh, it's as if you're actually focused.

57
00:03:17,432 --> 00:03:18,916
Rym: dash forward right away.

58
00:03:19,197 --> 00:03:23,154
Scott: It's as equally, if you think about it, you're actually controlling the other guy.

59
00:03:23,355 --> 00:03:25,265
Scott: You just don't know how you're controlling him, right?

60
00:03:25,286 --> 00:03:28,043
Scott: So it's like, Oh, if I do this input, it makes the other guy do this.

61
00:03:28,163 --> 00:03:30,175
Scott: And if I do this input, it makes the other guy do that.

62
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:33,108
Scott: And you just don't know what the mappings are exactly.

63
00:03:33,128 --> 00:03:33,429
Scott: You know?

64
00:03:34,032 --> 00:03:34,875
Scott: Yeah, it's cheating.

65
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:41,942
Rym: What I wait for is no one has made a, like an aim bot for FPS is yet that just watches the game is only aim bots for FPS.

66
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,657
Scott: You know what you mean aim bot for fighting game.

67
00:03:46,818 --> 00:03:48,764
Rym: I think we've invented a biological aim bot.

68
00:03:48,804 --> 00:03:50,750
Rym: It's a 14 year old South Korean kid.

69
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:52,515
Scott: That's for RTS is.

70
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:59,584
Scott: I've seen some street fighter kids that I'm pretty sure from Korea probably, but you know, the point is, is that, you know, just the breadth of skills.

71
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:12,183
Rym: I mean, I'll play a guy who cannot deal with my simplified jury flow chart, which is foot Hadouken repeated until the other guy dies.

72
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:17,243
Rym: And then the next guy I fight, I will never touch him and I'll only use like jabs and kicks.

73
00:04:17,704 --> 00:04:17,904
Scott: Yep.

74
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,959
Scott: Makes me feel really, really the only thing wrong with the game.

75
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:27,280
Scott: It's a great game in that it has this huge, you know, skill cap is basically stupid high.

76
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,012
Scott: Even the people who kick your ass and you don't even hit them once.

77
00:04:30,515 --> 00:04:30,756
Scott: Right.

78
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,248
Scott: The greatest guy in the world is Diego guy.

79
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,575
Scott: They can't even touch him.

80
00:04:34,615 --> 00:04:37,349
Scott: He's got like three times as many Xbox points as anyone else.

81
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:38,938
Scott: And he's not even using his own account.

82
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,247
Scott: He's using like his friend's account because he doesn't have an expert.

83
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:42,371
Scott: Right.

84
00:04:42,391 --> 00:04:45,723
Scott: So, you know, the skill cap is huge.

85
00:04:45,783 --> 00:04:49,917
Scott: The problem is, is that the curve is not high quality, right?

86
00:04:50,198 --> 00:04:54,885
Scott: You know, like I just said, fighting against the computer, the curve is flat and then you get to the end, it spikes straight up.

87
00:04:54,945 --> 00:04:56,271
Scott: It should be a linear curve.

88
00:04:56,613 --> 00:04:59,004
Scott: It's each guy should get progressively more difficult.

89
00:04:59,044 --> 00:05:02,823
Scott: And then I would actually be bothered by the fact that the computer cheats less.

90
00:05:03,286 --> 00:05:07,364
Scott: if the skill was, you know, the difficulty of each guy was slightly harder than the previous one.

91
00:05:08,047 --> 00:05:10,318
Rym: And no one's playing this game for the single player.

92
00:05:10,338 --> 00:05:12,469
Rym: That's just there is kind of like a cool challenge.

93
00:05:12,489 --> 00:05:23,474
Scott: But the thing is, even with the multiplayer, right, the skill curve is not so is really problematic because they don't, you know, they have these trials to sort of help you, but that's not really helping you.

94
00:05:23,776 --> 00:05:26,851
Scott: And the instruction book does give some more information than it used to.

95
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:31,469
Scott: Like it tells you that a cancel exists, but they don't give you a real tutorial.

96
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:31,710
Scott: Right.

97
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,496
Scott: What explains, for example.

98
00:05:33,557 --> 00:05:33,797
Scott: Right.

99
00:05:33,878 --> 00:05:39,719
Scott: OK, so I jump in the air and I do like, you know, the like the double fist that Bison has.

100
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:40,000
Scott: Right.

101
00:05:40,261 --> 00:05:43,577
Scott: And some other guy jumps in the air and he does a light kick.

102
00:05:43,597 --> 00:05:45,487
Rym: You want to know which one wins, which one wins.

103
00:05:45,728 --> 00:05:47,618
Rym: So, you know, there is a manual that tells you.

104
00:05:47,658 --> 00:05:48,904
Rym: this is called Game Facts.

105
00:05:49,065 --> 00:05:49,286
Scott: Right.

106
00:05:49,326 --> 00:05:51,396
Scott: But does it matter who does it first?

107
00:05:51,456 --> 00:05:53,606
Scott: Does it matter who's higher in the air?

108
00:05:53,706 --> 00:05:54,369
Scott: Does it matter?

109
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:54,550
Scott: Right.

110
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,394
Scott: There's all these.

111
00:05:55,414 --> 00:05:59,675
Scott: There's no X, you know, so how do if I'm jumping in the air, which button do I push is the best.

112
00:05:59,796 --> 00:06:04,580
Scott: I'm pretty sure Game Facts knows it's such a, you know, and then there's so many possible combinations, though.

113
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,220
Scott: It's like, OK, so maybe my, you know, strong kick in the air beats that guy's whatever.

114
00:06:09,341 --> 00:06:11,109
Scott: But everyone has six different pods.

115
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:12,616
Scott: And then some people have an air throw.

116
00:06:12,636 --> 00:06:21,290
Scott: You know, it's like you need to tell me each and every possible move and how to make it to make it and how to defend each and every possible move.

117
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:24,185
Scott: Like there's some moves like, oh, I figured out how to defend that move.

118
00:06:24,205 --> 00:06:28,207
Scott: You do this, but then some guy will do a move and it's like, I can't figure out any way.

119
00:06:28,227 --> 00:06:29,232
Scott: You can't block it low.

120
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:30,277
Scott: You can't block it high.

121
00:06:30,297 --> 00:06:32,087
Scott: You can't jab the guy while he's doing it.

122
00:06:32,328 --> 00:06:34,178
Scott: You can't shield it with a focus attack game.

123
00:06:34,198 --> 00:06:35,825
Scott: How do you beat that move?

124
00:06:35,865 --> 00:06:37,392
Scott: Game facts, you know, I don't know.

125
00:06:37,472 --> 00:06:37,994
Rym: Game facts.

126
00:06:38,396 --> 00:06:38,597
Scott: Yeah.

127
00:06:38,878 --> 00:06:40,889
Scott: But the point is, is it should be in the instruction manual.

128
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:50,492
Scott: Imagine if you bought a copy of some board game and the board game, I just did something and I got 100 points and you're like, what the hell am I supposed to do to stop you from doing that?

129
00:06:50,512 --> 00:06:51,881
Scott: It'd be like, oh, I'm not telling you.

130
00:06:51,901 --> 00:06:54,130
Scott: I just kept doing it.

131
00:06:54,512 --> 00:06:57,846
Scott: And then you look at the instruction book and the second book doesn't even say the move exists.

132
00:06:58,368 --> 00:06:58,649
Scott: Right.

133
00:06:59,312 --> 00:07:02,164
Scott: And then you go to game facts and maybe it says something about a game facts.

134
00:07:02,184 --> 00:07:04,235
Rym: You're like, ha doe can.

135
00:07:04,275 --> 00:07:04,436
Scott: Yeah.

136
00:07:04,456 --> 00:07:06,004
Scott: You go to game facts and you read something.

137
00:07:06,024 --> 00:07:06,628
Scott: You're like, hmm.

138
00:07:06,809 --> 00:07:07,755
Scott: All right, let me try that.

139
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,826
Scott: You try to do in the game and I go like, nope, that's wrong.

140
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:10,731
Scott: It doesn't work like that.

141
00:07:10,751 --> 00:07:15,493
Scott: You didn't clearly didn't understand what you read there cause it wasn't in plain English.

142
00:07:16,438 --> 00:07:32,180
Scott: You go to some forum and some guy tries to explain it to you and then you watch a youtube video of some guy playing the board game, doing the thing and then another guy stopping doing the thing and you look at it real close and slow motion and then you come back to the board game and I do the thing and then you do the same exact thing you saw in the video.

143
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,013
Scott: I'm like, well, nope, no, I still get a zillion victory points.

144
00:07:36,274 --> 00:07:38,662
Rym: It's see at least you got it wrong.

145
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:43,922
Rym: It is good that we are both bad at fighting games and RTS is not only even the guy.

146
00:07:43,942 --> 00:07:45,392
Scott: All right, so think about this though, right?

147
00:07:45,472 --> 00:07:47,363
Scott: Oh, we're bad at fighting games and RTS is right.

148
00:07:47,403 --> 00:07:50,697
Scott: That Diego guy who has three times more xbox points than anybody.

149
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,090
Scott: You think he's going to beat us at like Puerto Rico?

150
00:07:53,171 --> 00:07:54,720
Scott: No, it ain't gonna, it ain't gonna happen.

151
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,169
Rym: But I'm saying it's good that we play these games, we play these games and we're bad at them and we try to be good and we still fail.

152
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:02,600
Rym: That is the last vestige of gaming humility.

153
00:08:03,721 --> 00:08:03,962
Scott: Okay.

154
00:08:04,444 --> 00:08:05,710
Rym: What will we do if we're good at those games?

155
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:06,454
Rym: It'll never happen.

156
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:10,511
Rym: I mean, Conrad was watching me play and just sighing over the weekend.

157
00:08:11,414 --> 00:08:14,347
Rym: I'm getting there though, but I have a little tiny quick news.

158
00:08:14,688 --> 00:08:31,653
Rym: A lot of you probably know, but in case you don't, Dennis Hopper, very important, very famous actor and he is dead now, but the reason you might care is that you young kids might have not seen movie, a very important movie, movie called Mario brothers, super Mario brothers.

159
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:34,642
Scott: I saw it when I had the first, he is in the theater.

160
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:35,866
Scott: I got a story, right?

161
00:08:35,886 --> 00:08:37,674
Scott: So it was my friend's birthday party.

162
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:46,186
Scott: And for the birthday party we were all going down to see this movie in the movie theater, but the projector broke saving saving us.

163
00:08:46,788 --> 00:08:51,303
Scott: And we went to like, you know, the town baseball field and played baseball for like an hour.

164
00:08:51,925 --> 00:09:01,714
Scott: But you know, I later saw the movie of course, but it was this weird fate that had, you know, I should have listened to the omen and not see, you know what?

165
00:09:01,734 --> 00:09:12,349
Rym: You know, we're going to see Dungeons and dragons.

166
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,675
Rym: I was like, fuck you guys.

167
00:09:13,836 --> 00:09:16,386
Scott: No, it's weird because in my memory, right?

168
00:09:16,447 --> 00:09:21,827
Scott: It's like, I always remember like there was no way that I ever expected that to be good, right?

169
00:09:22,349 --> 00:09:22,690
Scott: Never.

170
00:09:23,192 --> 00:09:27,508
Scott: But I'm trying to think like, why did I actually go to see it to this day?

171
00:09:27,548 --> 00:09:32,429
Scott: Like everyone was going to see it and I went with everyone to go see you all infected by some sort of ghost.

172
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:40,467
Rym: I don't know why, because at no point did I have an expectation of the quality being high because I remember you guys are all on aim and you're like, come on, we're going.

173
00:09:40,488 --> 00:09:42,660
Rym: I'm like, no, seriously, no, I'm not coming.

174
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,361
Rym: No.

175
00:09:44,165 --> 00:09:45,128
Rym: Why are you going?

176
00:09:46,072 --> 00:09:48,663
Rym: And Pete came back and he was like, that was the worst movie I've ever seen.

177
00:09:48,683 --> 00:09:49,949
Scott: I was like, what did you expect?

178
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,401
Scott: I didn't expect, I'd never expected it to be good.

179
00:09:52,421 --> 00:09:53,345
Rym: I don't know why I went.

180
00:09:53,988 --> 00:09:55,795
Scott: I definitely wouldn't go if it came out today.

181
00:09:56,297 --> 00:10:02,680
Rym: Dennis Hopper played King Koopa and as bad as that movie was, it had two things that it got right.

182
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,356
Rym: One, it treated the Bob-omb with the proper amount of respect.

183
00:10:05,376 --> 00:10:08,108
Scott: That was like the only thing in the movie that was Mario accurate.

184
00:10:08,248 --> 00:10:12,983
Rym: And King Koopa played by an Ennis Hopper, pretty hilarious.

185
00:10:13,605 --> 00:10:15,232
Scott: What in the movie was not hilarious?

186
00:10:15,613 --> 00:10:17,119
Rym: Well, hilarious and good.

187
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,143
Rym: I think he was good.

188
00:10:18,164 --> 00:10:20,736
Rym: He played the part as best it could have been played.

189
00:10:20,797 --> 00:10:22,988
Scott: We asked you that yesterday before he was dead.

190
00:10:23,008 --> 00:10:24,556
Rym: I still would have said, you know what?

191
00:10:24,597 --> 00:10:26,105
Rym: King Koopa played that part really well.

192
00:10:26,407 --> 00:10:27,836
Scott: I don't even know who this guy is.

193
00:10:27,896 --> 00:10:28,158
Scott: What is he?

194
00:10:28,198 --> 00:10:29,163
Scott: Is he famous or anything else?

195
00:10:29,203 --> 00:10:32,842
Scott: I'm sure he's not just famous for being King Koopa because then he wouldn't be famous.

196
00:10:33,665 --> 00:10:34,348
Rym: Easy Rider?

197
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:35,573
Scott: I don't know what that is.

198
00:10:35,874 --> 00:10:37,079
Rym: You've never seen Easy Rider?

199
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:38,764
Scott: I'm moving the camera around by accident.

200
00:10:38,784 --> 00:10:39,346
Scott: Good game.

201
00:10:39,748 --> 00:10:42,215
Scott: It's attached to a chair.

202
00:10:42,737 --> 00:10:44,804
Rym: Oh no, some Ustream got into the audio show.

203
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:45,467
Scott: Oh shit.

204
00:10:45,788 --> 00:10:46,249
Rym: Good game.

205
00:10:46,992 --> 00:10:48,899
Scott: Why do you help to the long right there?

206
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,951
Rym: So you got any actual news for me or anything?

207
00:10:51,971 --> 00:10:58,078
Scott: It's sort of news, but I don't know how much news it is, but basically there's this thing called Super Mario Brothers X.

208
00:10:58,138 --> 00:10:59,847
Rym: There's this thing called Super Mario Brothers.

209
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,435
Scott: Super Mario Brothers X, right?

210
00:11:01,515 --> 00:11:02,138
Scott: And it's a game.

211
00:11:02,198 --> 00:11:02,540
Scott: It's free.

212
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,047
Scott: You can go to this website, download it.

213
00:11:04,107 --> 00:11:04,710
Scott: It's an exe.

214
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:05,755
Scott: It just runs, right?

215
00:11:06,338 --> 00:11:09,188
Scott: And basically what it is is the ultimate Mario engine.

216
00:11:09,831 --> 00:11:13,726
Scott: It contains, basically it's everything that's in Super Mario All-Stars.

217
00:11:13,746 --> 00:11:18,226
Scott: So everything from Super Mario one, two, three, and world, basically the real Mario games, right?

218
00:11:18,829 --> 00:11:26,719
Scott: It has every single power up, hammer suits, Nuki suit, kuribu shoe, everything, a whole bunch of you, Yoshi's new Yoshi's they invented.

219
00:11:26,739 --> 00:11:27,643
Scott: It's crazy, right?

220
00:11:27,683 --> 00:11:29,532
Scott: I bet, I bet this hammer Yoshi, I don't even know.

221
00:11:30,034 --> 00:11:30,315
Scott: Right.

222
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:34,331
Scott: And you can play co-op mode with Mario and Luigi at the same time.

223
00:11:34,572 --> 00:11:36,700
Rym: What does it do if you get too far apart?

224
00:11:37,482 --> 00:11:40,196
Scott: It's split screens it, and then it will unsplit screen when you're close together.

225
00:11:40,216 --> 00:11:40,397
Scott: Oh man.

226
00:11:41,421 --> 00:11:46,661
Scott: And it's got like, you know, an editor, so you can basically make levels and a real time editor.

227
00:11:46,722 --> 00:11:59,013
Scott: So you can edit while you're playing and you can create episodes in a Mario theme 3 or Mario world styled map, but you can also create a Mario 64 style map where there's a hub world that lets you collect stars from other worlds.

228
00:11:59,616 --> 00:12:02,065
Scott: And basically you can just, you know, this is the thing to make.

229
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,292
Scott: the ultimate Mario game on.

230
00:12:04,934 --> 00:12:12,028
Scott: And I think it comes with this three different worlds that you can get already is that there's the princess cliche, the great castle adventure and the invasion.

231
00:12:12,068 --> 00:12:12,932
Scott: Great castle adventure.

232
00:12:12,952 --> 00:12:14,038
Scott: Sounds like my kind of time.

233
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:14,440
Scott: Yeah.

234
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:23,538
Scott: Cause I'm a fan of the castles the most, the castles or the mansion, but I'm going to get this going on my windows run in HTVC, get a couple of X-Box controllers.

235
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:25,207
Scott: and who needs new Super Mario Brothers.

236
00:12:25,227 --> 00:12:26,293
Scott: This is going to be way better than that.

237
00:12:26,434 --> 00:12:26,836
Rym: Oh man.

238
00:12:27,178 --> 00:12:28,826
Rym: I'm actually kind of excited about playing that.

239
00:12:29,087 --> 00:12:29,288
Scott: Yeah.

240
00:12:29,308 --> 00:12:37,671
Scott: I mean this is totally not legitimate in any way, shape or form is probably infringing on all sorts of copyrights and they put up a nice big message like we love Nintendo.

241
00:12:37,692 --> 00:12:38,857
Scott: Don't Sue us, blah, blah, blah.

242
00:12:38,877 --> 00:12:40,023
Scott: But I downloaded it already.

243
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,887
Scott: So what you going to do?

244
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:41,792
Rym: Yeah, it's free.

245
00:12:41,932 --> 00:12:43,018
Scott: Take their website down.

246
00:12:43,038 --> 00:12:43,440
Rym: Go ahead.

247
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,327
Rym: I got it on BitTorrent forever.

248
00:12:45,407 --> 00:12:46,411
Scott: I got me a copy.

249
00:12:46,793 --> 00:12:48,138
Scott: So that's the end of that.

250
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:52,214
Scott: I suggest you also grab one soon is going to be fun.

251
00:12:52,234 --> 00:12:52,495
Scott: It's funny.

252
00:12:52,535 --> 00:13:00,170
Scott: It's a Mario night because it turns out now for all of us, you know, we've done a lot of Mario stuff on the show cause I was working on the, I'll talk about that later.

253
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:03,327
Scott: There's a lot of Mario stuff, but there hasn't been a lot of Mario lately.

254
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:04,293
Scott: No, not lately.

255
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,520
Rym: We haven't been playing Mario games.

256
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,387
Rym: I've been playing Nintendo games.

257
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:11,362
Rym: I mean I'm playing street fighter on my X-Box and star crafts.

258
00:13:11,883 --> 00:13:12,325
Scott: Yeah.

259
00:13:12,365 --> 00:13:13,529
Scott: You actually played some star craft.

260
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:13,970
Scott: Yeah.

261
00:13:14,071 --> 00:13:18,488
Rym: God, I, you know, I remember that I sucked at star craft.

262
00:13:18,508 --> 00:13:23,310
Rym: Like I just wasn't good at it and I'd be slow and then all this shit just comes and kills me and I can never do anything.

263
00:13:23,993 --> 00:13:29,754
Rym: So I'm playing in the, in the beta and I underestimated how fucking bad I am at that game.

264
00:13:29,814 --> 00:13:31,078
Rym: Jesus Christ.

265
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:32,988
Scott: You just start, you just lose immediately.

266
00:13:33,008 --> 00:13:33,169
Rym: Yeah.

267
00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:35,482
Rym: I'm like, all right, I go, all right, I got to build a thing.

268
00:13:35,522 --> 00:13:36,967
Rym: I got to harvest the two kinds of shit.

269
00:13:36,987 --> 00:13:37,810
Rym: This I'm dead.

270
00:13:38,472 --> 00:13:38,934
Scott: Yeah.

271
00:13:38,954 --> 00:13:39,435
Rym: Ah, great.

272
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:51,001
Rym: So pretty much how it rolls, but for anyone who's old school, you know the answer to this already, but the video one is very well done, very short and two, it hearkens back to an earlier time.

273
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:56,699
Rym: Someone did a myth busters style kind of treatment of the old myth.

274
00:13:56,719 --> 00:14:04,303
Rym: You know, when you're a kid, it's like 1988 and your friend down the street is like, Hey, stop moving the camera.

275
00:14:04,323 --> 00:14:04,645
Rym: Scott.

276
00:14:05,147 --> 00:14:06,454
Scott: I'm trying to figure out where it should be.

277
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:08,122
Rym: He's like, it's right where it should be.

278
00:14:08,142 --> 00:14:12,499
Rym: It was fine until you moved it, bringing it into the show.

279
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:18,904
Rym: The kid down the street is like, Hey, I jumped over the flagpole and you're like, bullshit, bull fucking shit.

280
00:14:19,065 --> 00:14:19,628
Rym: There's no way.

281
00:14:19,648 --> 00:14:22,541
Rym: you jumped over that flagpole and maybe you fight with each other.

282
00:14:22,743 --> 00:14:24,331
Rym: Maybe like one kid has a game genie.

283
00:14:24,351 --> 00:14:26,945
Rym: He's like, here, let's use the game genie to jump over the flagpole.

284
00:14:26,965 --> 00:14:29,800
Rym: And of course with the game genie, you can jump over the flagpole.

285
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,771
Rym: Not that hard, but there was always the legend.

286
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:34,458
Rym: Could you do it without the game genie?

287
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,950
Rym: And before there was a game genie, could you do it?

288
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:37,835
Rym: And what's back there?

289
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:41,953
Rym: You know, this was back in the day when NES games were mystical.

290
00:14:42,013 --> 00:14:43,338
Rym: They were like magical places.

291
00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:44,262
Rym: There was shit back there.

292
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,851
Scott: It wasn't even just NES games.

293
00:14:45,871 --> 00:14:47,620
Scott: Pretty much every game was mystical, right?

294
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,771
Scott: They'd be like, Oh man, immortal combat too.

295
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:51,842
Scott: They've got all these alities that you don't even know.

296
00:14:51,882 --> 00:14:54,151
Scott: You can see boobs.

297
00:14:54,211 --> 00:14:55,235
Scott: You can see everything.

298
00:14:55,275 --> 00:14:56,480
Scott: You just got to do it right.

299
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,732
Rym: You know, there are, I want to bring general Leo back to life.

300
00:15:00,153 --> 00:15:03,264
Rym: Spoilers by the way, walk back and forth in front of his grave.

301
00:15:03,264 --> 00:15:03,805
Rym: 99,999 times.

302
00:15:03,845 --> 00:15:04,527
Rym: And did you do it?

303
00:15:04,548 --> 00:15:08,881
Rym: I didn't, but, uh, I don't know.

304
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:10,247
Rym: I know people who did at least try.

305
00:15:10,328 --> 00:15:11,293
Scott: It doesn't work, does it?

306
00:15:12,137 --> 00:15:15,330
Rym: But the worst thing is some of those myths were totally legit.

307
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:21,774
Rym: Like the way to get the pink puff tail and then get the extra item from the adamant guy in a Silvertown.

308
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:27,054
Rym: in final fantasy four or Mac or Mac or Mac scared the ever living shit out of me.

309
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:37,280
Scott: The only reason I suspected at all that he really existed was because Nintendo power told me, yeah, you get, that's the thing is if there wasn't like a Nintendo power to told you everything, then how could you know?

310
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,866
Scott: And the thing was you always suspected.

311
00:15:38,926 --> 00:15:41,617
Scott: aha, but what if they don't know everything?

312
00:15:42,219 --> 00:15:42,500
Scott: Right?

313
00:15:43,081 --> 00:15:48,263
Scott: Cause like in those days, the game developers weren't just giving their codes to some strategy guide, right?

314
00:15:48,604 --> 00:15:51,155
Scott: Or, you know, they were, they were actually secret stuff.

315
00:15:51,737 --> 00:15:57,758
Rym: And the tech to dump a ROM was not in the hands of the majority of people, let alone analyze around.

316
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:10,435
Rym: But imagine if you're playing right and you know, you're near the end of the game, you hit war mech and he just kills you and you tell your friends and none of them and all the experimenting they can do ever see a war Mac again and you never see a war Mac again.

317
00:16:10,455 --> 00:16:11,339
Rym: Yeah.

318
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:12,423
Scott: And you didn't take a picture, but

319
00:16:13,286 --> 00:16:23,835
Rym: uh, you know, those days are long gone, but this video really brought back a lot of nostalgia for me because they, they took one of those things and they did something that I would have loved for people who are done

320
00:16:23,996 --> 00:16:24,639
Scott: your thing of the day.

321
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:25,725
Rym: It's my news.

322
00:16:25,906 --> 00:16:26,188
Scott: Okay.

323
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:26,972
Rym: I just thought it was cool.

324
00:16:27,173 --> 00:16:29,605
Scott: I was like, at what point are we at in the show here?

325
00:16:29,926 --> 00:16:31,533
Scott: It seems like thing of the day material.

326
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:32,478
Rym: Cool Mario thing.

327
00:16:32,538 --> 00:16:34,103
Rym: And you know, think about it.

328
00:16:34,143 --> 00:16:37,095
Rym: This is an era of gaming that can never come back.

329
00:16:37,156 --> 00:16:44,319
Rym: At least not any time in the near future where there'll be mysteries that aren't just solved by game facts or walkthroughs.

330
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,784
Scott: How was this news though?

331
00:16:46,387 --> 00:16:47,873
Rym: Cause it was a new thing and it was cool.

332
00:16:47,893 --> 00:16:50,041
Rym: What other gaming news is there?

333
00:16:50,222 --> 00:16:50,523
Rym: Nothing.

334
00:16:50,603 --> 00:16:51,786
Rym: Starcraft two is coming.

335
00:16:51,806 --> 00:16:57,222
Rym: We already talked about the stuff we don't care about.

336
00:16:57,242 --> 00:17:02,642
Scott: Yeah, it just doesn't seem like at least mine is, is pretends to be news cause like, Hey, this thing came out.

337
00:17:02,702 --> 00:17:03,523
Scott: That's the news.

338
00:17:03,663 --> 00:17:05,285
Rym: Mine is new.

339
00:17:05,305 --> 00:17:09,489
Scott: Alright, whatever.

340
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:27,092
Rym: So anyway, things of the day, I guess I did two things of the day since my news wasn't news enough, but uh, you may not know who this is.

341
00:17:27,132 --> 00:17:32,415
Rym: You don't pay attention to pop culture, but Keisha or Keisha or however you want to say it made a song.

342
00:17:32,455 --> 00:17:33,359
Rym: You might recognize it.

343
00:17:41,902 --> 00:17:44,351
Rym: And I inexplicably like the song.

344
00:17:44,371 --> 00:17:48,106
Rym: I actually found out about it from the stupid Simpsons opener that was done to it.

345
00:17:48,548 --> 00:17:54,616
Rym: And then I saw the music video for it and I liked the chorus, but the lyrics are like eighties bratty and I kind of hate that part.

346
00:17:54,656 --> 00:18:01,901
Rym: But all that aside, for some reason, this song, well, no, for many reasons generated a lot of internet and musical hate.

347
00:18:02,743 --> 00:18:11,187
Rym: So someone made a remix, a pretty awesome remix mashup, if you will, of the Tik TOK song mashed up with black eyed peas.

348
00:18:11,568 --> 00:18:11,969
Rym: Shut up.

349
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,376
Rym: And it's pretty fucking fantastic.

350
00:18:15,098 --> 00:18:15,459
Scott: All right.

351
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:17,406
Scott: I don't, I, you played a part of it.

352
00:18:17,466 --> 00:18:18,309
Scott: I don't, I don't get it.

353
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:19,695
Rym: It's music.

354
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,020
Rym: It's good dancing music.

355
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,804
Rym: What's wrong with you?

356
00:18:22,387 --> 00:18:23,733
Scott: It doesn't sound so great to me.

357
00:18:24,034 --> 00:18:24,356
Rym: All right.

358
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:25,059
Rym: Well, what do you like?

359
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,583
Rym: What music you listening to right now?

360
00:18:26,924 --> 00:18:27,565
Scott: Right now?

361
00:18:27,585 --> 00:18:28,166
Rym: Like what?

362
00:18:28,206 --> 00:18:37,128
Rym: Like old, how old, like Baroque, like late 18 hundreds.

363
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,075
Rym: That's what you're listening to right now.

364
00:18:39,296 --> 00:18:39,537
Rym: Yeah.

365
00:18:39,758 --> 00:18:43,566
Scott: Name a song like Dvorak and shit.

366
00:18:43,606 --> 00:18:44,108
Scott: All right.

367
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,560
Rym: Can you name any song he wrote the new world symphony?

368
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,743
Rym: Can you name another one?

369
00:18:51,972 --> 00:18:54,699
Scott: Anyway, Pandora just sort of takes care of it for me.

370
00:18:54,719 --> 00:18:55,502
Scott: I don't really look.

371
00:18:55,522 --> 00:18:56,667
Rym: All right.

372
00:18:56,687 --> 00:18:57,672
Rym: So anyway, what do you got for me?

373
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:00,910
Scott: So my thing of the day, as far as appear to your thing of the day, I don't know.

374
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,816
Rym: This is pretty awesome.

375
00:19:01,917 --> 00:19:02,862
Scott: Now you're thinking these shit.

376
00:19:02,882 --> 00:19:04,389
Rym: Shut up, shut up, shut up.

377
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:05,032
Rym: Yeah.

378
00:19:05,072 --> 00:19:09,730
Scott: You want to shut up, but you can't handle this Russian hobbit illustration.

379
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,374
Rym: That's a hobbit.

380
00:19:10,414 --> 00:19:11,379
Rym: That's the sob dent.

381
00:19:13,881 --> 00:19:17,914
Scott: Check out how fucking bad ass the illustrated Russian hobbit is.

382
00:19:17,934 --> 00:19:18,637
Scott: Look at that shit.

383
00:19:18,817 --> 00:19:19,520
Rym: Oh my God.

384
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,584
Rym: Who illustrated it?

385
00:19:20,805 --> 00:19:22,030
Scott: Some Russian dude.

386
00:19:22,211 --> 00:19:24,399
Scott: Look at Bilbo's hairy fucking legs.

387
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,466
Scott: And Gandalf's like rye smile.

388
00:19:29,527 --> 00:19:30,470
Scott: Like, Oh yeah.

389
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,217
Scott: Pimping Gand off the wizard.

390
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:32,860
Rym: You know what I want?

391
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,783
Rym: I'm telling you right now.

392
00:19:33,804 --> 00:19:36,495
Rym: I want to make a poster of one of those pages.

393
00:19:36,515 --> 00:19:39,506
Scott: arguing, arguing ogres, right?

394
00:19:40,128 --> 00:19:42,937
Scott: Frigging, frigging, nasty dwarves, all greedy and shit.

395
00:19:43,138 --> 00:19:43,359
Rym: All right.

396
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:43,559
Rym: Right.

397
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,403
Rym: I'm saying it straight up.

398
00:19:44,463 --> 00:19:52,179
Rym: If I can, I'm going to blow those up, make a series of like a column hanging out in the series of frame posters based on that and put it on my wall.

399
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:53,281
Scott: All right.

400
00:19:53,301 --> 00:19:53,643
Scott: Wait, wait, wait.

401
00:19:53,663 --> 00:19:55,431
Scott: You got to check out the awesome spiders.

402
00:19:55,512 --> 00:19:58,907
Rym: It's very reminiscent of the illustrations in the movie.

403
00:19:58,947 --> 00:19:59,991
Scott: Look at those spiders.

404
00:20:00,011 --> 00:20:02,743
Rym: You ever read like the Moomin Valley books?

405
00:20:03,164 --> 00:20:03,908
Scott: No, not really.

406
00:20:03,928 --> 00:20:05,434
Rym: You'd like him similar illustrations.

407
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:06,197
Scott: Yeah.

408
00:20:06,237 --> 00:20:06,780
Scott: But you know what?

409
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,181
Scott: They got.

410
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:08,810
Scott: think y'all check out the sleeping smog.

411
00:20:09,192 --> 00:20:09,594
Scott: Oh shit.

412
00:20:09,615 --> 00:20:10,600
Scott: Watch out invisible hobbit.

413
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,722
Scott: Come and take your goal.

414
00:20:11,922 --> 00:20:12,282
Rym: Oh no.

415
00:20:12,363 --> 00:20:15,047
Scott: Smog got arrow.

416
00:20:15,107 --> 00:20:15,527
Rym: Oh my God.

417
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,549
Rym: Look at his face.

418
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:19,493
Scott: He's like, Oh no.

419
00:20:24,761 --> 00:20:27,653
Scott: Let's say you want to do some, you want to do some hobbit trivia.

420
00:20:28,215 --> 00:20:31,607
Scott: Who is the name of the guy who arrowed small?

421
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,032
Rym: I read that book when you know what?

422
00:20:33,253 --> 00:20:36,183
Rym: I haven't read the hobbit since my age was single digits.

423
00:20:37,047 --> 00:20:37,369
Rym: Really?

424
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:38,976
Rym: His name, but he was the human from the town.

425
00:20:38,996 --> 00:20:40,322
Rym: He had the black sheathed arrow.

426
00:20:40,543 --> 00:20:40,984
Scott: That's right.

427
00:20:41,185 --> 00:20:43,213
Rym: And he only had one, but it couldn't miss.

428
00:20:43,294 --> 00:20:44,498
Rym: So only needed one.

429
00:20:44,518 --> 00:20:44,579
Rym: Yep.

430
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,504
Rym: I forgot his name.

431
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,569
Scott: I also forgot his name.

432
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:49,438
Scott: That's why it was a typical trivia question.

433
00:20:49,478 --> 00:20:50,161
Scott: I'm looking at it.

434
00:20:50,201 --> 00:20:52,347
Rym: I should have been like, yeah, that's a Joe bow.

435
00:20:52,407 --> 00:20:59,228
Scott: The archery dude at the bar shot his black arrow into smogs left breast.

436
00:20:59,348 --> 00:21:00,493
Rym: I got to read the hobbit again.

437
00:21:00,633 --> 00:21:02,079
Scott: Armor's weak spot killing him.

438
00:21:03,481 --> 00:21:09,965
Scott: Anyway, this actually is sort of a double thing of the day because this appears on a blog called English, Russia.com.

439
00:21:09,985 --> 00:21:10,507
Scott: And you know what?

440
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:11,210
Rym: Wait a minute.

441
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:14,182
Rym: Is that just like the English.com of Russia?

442
00:21:14,402 --> 00:21:17,071
Scott: No, it's basically just awesome shit from Russia.

443
00:21:17,091 --> 00:21:19,900
Rym: I like stuff from Russia in a big way.

444
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,671
Rym: Like Russia has always been my go-to place for cool stuff.

445
00:21:22,691 --> 00:21:25,262
Scott: The subtitle of the site is only in Russia.

446
00:21:25,282 --> 00:21:43,228
Scott: It has everything from like graduating girls, uh, hanging out in the water to like stuff in the supermarket that has swastikas on it to the saltiest lake, to crazy Ukrainians at a soccer game to, uh, a truck full of alcohol that crashed.

447
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:44,711
Rym: Oh, wow.

448
00:21:45,532 --> 00:21:45,853
Scott: Right.

449
00:21:46,414 --> 00:21:50,182
Scott: Here's some college girls hanging out in the fountain.

450
00:21:50,202 --> 00:21:51,708
Rym: I am a big fan of that.

451
00:21:51,748 --> 00:21:52,852
Rym: Zobnit from Faulkner.

452
00:21:53,113 --> 00:21:53,434
Scott: Yeah.

453
00:21:53,454 --> 00:21:54,959
Scott: So there you go.

454
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:55,541
Scott: All right.

455
00:21:55,581 --> 00:21:59,050
Scott: Meta moment, the meta moment.

456
00:21:59,091 --> 00:22:02,620
Scott: So the book club is cosmos, which I'm reading right now.

457
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,343
Rym: We're going to finish it.

458
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:10,018
Scott: We're going to do it Thursday unless something weird comes up now, which, you know, if you're listening, maybe is already past that day.

459
00:22:10,058 --> 00:22:10,319
Scott: Who knows?

460
00:22:11,641 --> 00:22:16,498
Scott: Um, also I did a whole bunch of updating to the website from recruit.com.

461
00:22:16,578 --> 00:22:21,436
Scott: Most of it, you will not notice yet because it was all stuff that is behind the scene.

462
00:22:21,617 --> 00:22:24,065
Rym: It's basically setting up for awesome.

463
00:22:25,269 --> 00:22:25,530
Scott: Yeah.

464
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,135
Scott: It's going to be more awesome.

465
00:22:27,516 --> 00:22:29,444
Scott: I'm going to keep working on it and doing a bunch of stuff.

466
00:22:29,525 --> 00:22:36,374
Scott: Most of the stuff I'm going to do in the Fred first, it's both basically to make our jobs easier, you know, to make posting the show a lot less work.

467
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:40,187
Scott: But, uh, in the longer run, we're going to start changing other things.

468
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:49,493
Scott: If you notice errors on the site, if there's any broken links, if there's anything you would like to see changed, if there's anything we could do, that would actually make you want to visit the site.

469
00:22:49,513 --> 00:22:51,022
Scott: Cause I know that almost nobody visits it.

470
00:22:51,062 --> 00:22:55,524
Scott: Everyone just goes to the forum or just goes to iTunes and never comes to front recruit.com.

471
00:22:55,544 --> 00:22:57,110
Scott: Uh, let me know.

472
00:22:57,151 --> 00:23:03,173
Scott: I'm going to try to get figured out how to do some like collaborative show notes and all sorts of stuff to try to make you visit it.

473
00:23:03,254 --> 00:23:04,980
Scott: So, uh, visit it.

474
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:05,322
Rym: Yeah.

475
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,128
Rym: We're coming up in.

476
00:23:06,269 --> 00:23:07,740
Rym: a lot of you've been joining the forums lately.

477
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,059
Scott: Going to try to add a video section eventually, you know, that kind of stuff.

478
00:23:11,801 --> 00:23:12,686
Scott: It's, it's good times.

479
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:13,491
Rym: Yep.

480
00:23:13,753 --> 00:23:20,664
Rym: And of course, you know, conventions, Connecticut is coming up in about a month in Connecticut, Hartford, Connecticut, June or July, ninth, 10th and 11th.

481
00:23:20,724 --> 00:23:22,591
Rym: So keep that up.

482
00:23:22,873 --> 00:23:25,885
Rym: I'm not going to go into our list of panels or everything, but we're the heads of panels.

483
00:23:25,945 --> 00:23:28,800
Rym: So all the panels kind of have our seal of approval.

484
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,571
Rym: Gee, well, as best as we could.

485
00:23:31,591 --> 00:23:32,014
Rym: Yeah.

486
00:23:32,094 --> 00:23:36,898
Scott: I mean, we still, we need, you know, we needed a lot of panels to fill the schedule, which, you know, we had to accept.

487
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:38,746
Scott: panel, you know, pretty much all the panels.

488
00:23:38,806 --> 00:23:38,987
Scott: Right.

489
00:23:39,148 --> 00:23:46,260
Rym: And, uh, PAX West, New York anime festival, comic con combined MAGFest, all that stuff is coming up off on the horizon.

490
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:47,362
Scott: Yep.

491
00:23:48,024 --> 00:23:52,360
Rym: And, uh, the only other thing we got to watch out Libsyn is being kind of a cock lately.

492
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,042
Rym: So, right.

493
00:23:53,283 --> 00:24:06,271
Rym: So if you ever hear an advertisement on GeekNights, let us know immediately, even if it's just something at the beginning of the show, that's like, Hey, Libsyn, this is hosted on Libsyn because we're, we're, they're already on notice.

494
00:24:06,371 --> 00:24:13,655
Rym: So if an ad so much as comes your way in any capacity, it wasn't fucking us and there, the shit will fly.

495
00:24:13,675 --> 00:24:18,494
Scott: And if anyone advertise, if anyone knows like a legitimate alternative to Libsyn, right.

496
00:24:18,554 --> 00:24:19,739
Scott: Let us know right away.

497
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:20,000
Scott: Right.

498
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:31,658
Scott: Basically what we need is we need something that is reliable, like guaranteed to host our stuff, you know, for reals and has basically infinity bandwidth and won't cost a fortune.

499
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:31,739
Rym: Yes.

500
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:35,274
Rym: Because if it costs a fortune, Amazon S3 is not that much money.

501
00:24:35,314 --> 00:24:36,158
Rym: We'll go to that instead.

502
00:24:36,198 --> 00:24:36,339
Scott: Yeah.

503
00:24:36,379 --> 00:24:38,245
Scott: That would cost us like $200 a month.

504
00:24:38,265 --> 00:24:40,592
Scott: Whereas Libsyn's like 30 something.

505
00:24:40,933 --> 00:24:44,686
Scott: So we need, basically it has to be reasonable amount of money.

506
00:24:44,706 --> 00:24:47,760
Scott: It's like we would pay $50 a month, but we would not pay 200.

507
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,770
Rym: You know, remember this kids we're trucking for you.

508
00:24:50,091 --> 00:24:55,353
Rym: We'll, we'll, we'll move from 30 bucks a month to 200 a month just to not have ads in our show.

509
00:24:55,374 --> 00:24:56,277
Scott: I'm not moving to 200.

510
00:24:56,277 --> 00:25:01,355
Scott: You want to, you pay, well, we'll split it in the show for a hundred.

511
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:02,861
Scott: I mean, a hundred dollars a month is too much.

512
00:25:02,882 --> 00:25:04,170
Rym: You're going to let ads be in the show.

513
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,116
Rym: Then what are you going to do?

514
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:07,206
Scott: I'm going to find some, what do you do?

515
00:25:07,608 --> 00:25:08,351
Scott: What do you do?

516
00:25:08,452 --> 00:25:08,753
Scott: I'll do.

517
00:25:08,793 --> 00:25:09,677
Scott: So I'll find something.

518
00:25:09,697 --> 00:25:14,458
Scott: She had the hostage, I guess, but I will, I will do everything I can to find some, I'm curious.

519
00:25:14,699 --> 00:25:16,064
Rym: Cause I know Daryl Surratt would get that.

520
00:25:16,285 --> 00:25:17,009
Rym: Do you get it?

521
00:25:17,129 --> 00:25:19,037
Rym: Anytime I reference, what do you do?

522
00:25:19,138 --> 00:25:20,483
Rym: What do you do?

523
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:22,973
Rym: Because the answer to that is shoot the hostage.

524
00:25:23,134 --> 00:25:25,423
Rym: Do you, do you, do you have any idea what movie that's from?

525
00:25:25,443 --> 00:25:30,003
Scott: Uh, I remember that there was a movie where you shoot the hostage, but I forget which movie it was.

526
00:25:30,023 --> 00:25:31,087
Rym: I'm just curious.

527
00:25:31,468 --> 00:25:32,151
Rym: I feel hard.

528
00:25:32,352 --> 00:25:34,480
Scott: I've seen, I've seen, you've seen like part of it.

529
00:25:34,861 --> 00:25:36,347
Rym: It's a Charlie Sheen movie.

530
00:25:36,367 --> 00:25:37,452
Scott: It was some movie.

531
00:25:37,472 --> 00:25:40,950
Scott: I remember they're like guys in an elevator when he's going to shoot the hostage or something like that.

532
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,740
Scott: And then they were in a parking lot.

533
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:50,568
Rym: Anyway, speaking of shooting, there's a board game that is basically a prettied up simulation of Russian roulette and we really like it.

534
00:25:51,371 --> 00:25:52,775
Scott: It's not Russian roulette.

535
00:25:53,016 --> 00:25:53,959
Rym: It's Zularetto.

536
00:25:53,979 --> 00:25:55,747
Rym: It's basically like Russian zoulette.

537
00:25:56,028 --> 00:25:56,691
Scott: No, it's not.

538
00:25:56,711 --> 00:25:57,153
Scott: There's nothing.

539
00:25:57,554 --> 00:25:57,996
Scott: It is.

540
00:25:58,217 --> 00:25:58,920
Rym: So here's the game.

541
00:25:59,261 --> 00:26:01,872
Rym: You've got like, you've got five people sitting around a table.

542
00:26:02,314 --> 00:26:07,534
Rym: You've got five pistols with three chambers each and you put bullets or animals in them.

543
00:26:08,237 --> 00:26:09,341
Scott: There's no bullets, nothing.

544
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:11,030
Scott: There's nothing bad that you can put in there.

545
00:26:11,232 --> 00:26:19,429
Rym: I'll point out that if I've got, you know, monkeys and giraffes and like I've got my setup, I got no more free spots for animals and I don't need giraffes.

546
00:26:20,031 --> 00:26:21,416
Rym: And you put three giraffes in that gun.

547
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:23,244
Rym: That is three bullets in that train.

548
00:26:23,344 --> 00:26:27,060
Scott: I'm pretty sure you only lose points for type of animal in your barn, right?

549
00:26:27,561 --> 00:26:33,260
Rym: So if I don't need a giraffe, it's per each type in your zoo or in the barn, I think.

550
00:26:33,782 --> 00:26:35,027
Scott: So it's type in the barn, right?

551
00:26:35,067 --> 00:26:36,814
Scott: It's not number of total in the barn.

552
00:26:36,855 --> 00:26:41,538
Scott: So if you have three different guys in your barn, that sucks worse than having three giraffes in the barn.

553
00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:41,719
Scott: Yeah.

554
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:42,963
Rym: Still a bullet.

555
00:26:43,124 --> 00:26:43,727
Rym: I don't want to take it.

556
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:46,541
Scott: No, but the thing is, it might not be a bullet for anyone else.

557
00:26:46,842 --> 00:26:49,791
Scott: So, you know, it's, it's far more selective bullets.

558
00:26:49,892 --> 00:26:51,697
Scott: It's far more advanced.

559
00:26:51,737 --> 00:26:54,973
Rym: Like in a lesson is learned, but the damage is irreversible with the love gun.

560
00:26:55,033 --> 00:26:57,485
Scott: It's far more advanced than Russian roulette.

561
00:26:57,545 --> 00:26:58,911
Scott: It's not even close.

562
00:26:59,092 --> 00:27:00,638
Rym: Scott actually played this game before me.

563
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:03,253
Scott: You know, I've played it two times now.

564
00:27:03,273 --> 00:27:04,480
Scott: I think you've only played it one time.

565
00:27:05,141 --> 00:27:06,666
Scott: First time I played, I won.

566
00:27:06,686 --> 00:27:08,311
Scott: I did really well.

567
00:27:08,351 --> 00:27:11,220
Scott: The second time I played, I just saw so bad.

568
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,343
Scott: That was awful.

569
00:27:12,363 --> 00:27:14,031
Rym: It was just awful.

570
00:27:14,131 --> 00:27:15,156
Scott: Oh, it was absolutely awful.

571
00:27:15,196 --> 00:27:18,854
Rym: But the thing is, you know, if you're looking for a board game to play, it won this field as you are.

572
00:27:18,935 --> 00:27:19,900
Rym: So it's worth buying.

573
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:29,382
Rym: I mean, if not, if you, if you're looking for recommendations to buy board games, you can listen to us or just go to board game geek and play the top 20.

574
00:27:29,382 --> 00:27:30,187
Scott: That's pretty much it.

575
00:27:30,268 --> 00:27:31,959
Rym: It's like 18 of those games are great.

576
00:27:32,701 --> 00:27:33,685
Scott: Yeah.

577
00:27:33,705 --> 00:27:37,943
Scott: But basically the way Zulu better works is you got the zoo and you got to get animals in the zoo, right?

578
00:27:37,963 --> 00:27:39,954
Scott: And there's three, there's three different patches.

579
00:27:39,975 --> 00:27:42,046
Scott: They're all three different exhibits in your zoo.

580
00:27:42,106 --> 00:27:45,221
Scott: And you can unlock the fourth exhibit, which you pretty much have to do to win.

581
00:27:45,462 --> 00:27:45,643
Scott: Right.

582
00:27:46,486 --> 00:27:49,378
Scott: Uh, and you want to fill each exhibit with one kind of animal.

583
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:50,463
Scott: You can't mix the animals.

584
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:53,035
Scott: You can't have the elephants and the drafts together.

585
00:27:53,076 --> 00:27:53,679
Scott: That doesn't work.

586
00:27:53,699 --> 00:27:58,481
Scott: You got to have, you know, so you want to get four kinds of animals and you don't want any other kinds, right?

587
00:27:58,542 --> 00:27:59,405
Scott: Every other kind.

588
00:27:59,446 --> 00:28:00,872
Scott: you get all your extra animals.

589
00:28:01,214 --> 00:28:06,676
Scott: You have to tie them up in the barn and that's cost you money, but no one can visit the animals in the barn.

590
00:28:06,756 --> 00:28:08,744
Scott: So you don't get any points for that.

591
00:28:08,865 --> 00:28:11,618
Scott: You lose points for paying for animals to stay in the barn.

592
00:28:11,638 --> 00:28:12,602
Scott: So you want to get rid of those guys.

593
00:28:13,827 --> 00:28:19,126
Scott: So basically there's these trucks that deliver animals and every turn, everyone takes turns.

594
00:28:19,246 --> 00:28:29,238
Scott: Every round, everyone takes turns, filling up the trucks with animals from the Savannah, I guess, or wherever, wherever the poachers collect them from next door, right?

595
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,606
Scott: Wherever the animals come from.

596
00:28:31,646 --> 00:28:35,341
Scott: So they get piled on the trucks and the animals mixed freely on the truck.

597
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:38,680
Rym: Now this is the fun part because you got these, you know, five players, there's five trucks.

598
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,389
Rym: It's kind of like musical chairs of the animals.

599
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:44,913
Rym: At this point, every round you draw one of these tiles and you think, all right, what truck do I put it on?

600
00:28:45,195 --> 00:28:48,307
Rym: So say there's a truck that has two monkeys and I know Scott wants monkeys.

601
00:28:49,009 --> 00:28:52,642
Rym: I put a fucking bear on that truck and I don't want bears.

602
00:28:52,782 --> 00:28:58,868
Scott: So basically Rym is saying, aha, Scott, if you want, you know, to take these two monkeys, you're going to have to also take this bear.

603
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:09,154
Scott: And it's like, ah, and basically what you do is you look at what everyone else wants and you look at what you got and you try to make trucks that are going to be good if you take them and bad if other people take them.

604
00:29:09,616 --> 00:29:15,797
Scott: And, but the thing is on your turn, you can either put an animal on a truck or take a truck.

605
00:29:16,057 --> 00:29:16,860
Scott: You can't do both.

606
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:24,641
Scott: So if you draw something that's really good for you, you have to put it on a truck and you have to wait for everyone else to take their turn before you have a chance of taking that truck.

607
00:29:24,661 --> 00:29:25,103
Scott: And you know what?

608
00:29:25,646 --> 00:29:27,215
Scott: Someone else might take that truck from you.

609
00:29:27,235 --> 00:29:32,119
Scott: So if you make these really good trucks, someone else is just going to take them and leave you with a crappy truck.

610
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,339
Rym: And there are some things that can go into the trucks like a coin or a vending stand that are always good.

611
00:29:36,701 --> 00:29:36,881
Scott: Yep.

612
00:29:37,022 --> 00:29:37,665
Scott: Just, oh, great.

613
00:29:37,725 --> 00:29:38,569
Rym: They're just points.

614
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:43,149
Scott: So they're still not as good as animals that are, you're, you're kind of animal, nothing.

615
00:29:43,289 --> 00:29:51,086
Scott: And then right on top of that, there's some animals, most animals are too young and genderless, but there are a few animals that have gone through puberty and can make a baby.

616
00:29:51,387 --> 00:29:59,082
Scott: Now that that's where some of the, if you can get like a male giraffe and a female giraffe, you get a free giraffe when you get them together in the, in your zoo.

617
00:29:59,223 --> 00:30:01,996
Rym: Now, this is, that is the aspect of the game.

618
00:30:02,016 --> 00:30:11,892
Rym: I mean, you know, this is one of those board games that really brings out the German board gamer style, playing with the theme, making lewd jokes about smashing sheep into wood.

619
00:30:11,952 --> 00:30:15,282
Rym: And it really, it really comes out strong in Yep.

620
00:30:16,306 --> 00:30:18,233
Scott: Uh, lots of babby making jokes there.

621
00:30:18,453 --> 00:30:21,203
Scott: The thing is, let's say you don't have room for the babby.

622
00:30:21,223 --> 00:30:22,227
Scott: No, no, you get him.

623
00:30:22,247 --> 00:30:23,531
Scott: He just goes in the bar.

624
00:30:23,912 --> 00:30:27,968
Rym: And even if you've got a pen full of monkeys, you got one more monkey in the bar now.

625
00:30:27,988 --> 00:30:28,933
Rym: Well, that's, that's points.

626
00:30:29,174 --> 00:30:29,395
Rym: Yeah.

627
00:30:29,556 --> 00:30:30,260
Rym: Negative points.

628
00:30:31,322 --> 00:30:32,408
Scott: And then there's the money, right?

629
00:30:32,449 --> 00:30:34,300
Scott: Which you can get from coins and from other things.

630
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:39,444
Scott: Like if you fill up an area of your zoo, you get coins and basically you can use the coins as a corrective measure, right?

631
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:43,096
Scott: So it's like, oh shit, I need to unlock the next area of my zoo.

632
00:30:43,116 --> 00:30:46,571
Scott: So I'll pay coins or I need to move these animals.

633
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:48,259
Scott: I put them in the wrong section of the zoo.

634
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,263
Scott: Well, you can use coins.

635
00:30:49,343 --> 00:30:59,024
Scott: Basically you can use coins to correct for mistakes that you have made or for things that you didn't really make a mistake, but you know, the odds and the way things turned out, it didn't go your way.

636
00:30:59,044 --> 00:31:02,078
Scott: If you get enough coins, you can sort of fix it a little bit.

637
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:10,698
Scott: You know, you can use coins to get an animal out of someone else's barn, which helps them out, but it also helps you out because you get the animal you want and you know, it gives them a coin also.

638
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:13,832
Scott: So then they can correct for something that they messed up a little bit.

639
00:31:14,354 --> 00:31:16,804
Scott: And the game ends when I think there's no more animals, right?

640
00:31:17,065 --> 00:31:17,587
Rym: I think so.

641
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:18,371
Rym: I forget.

642
00:31:18,391 --> 00:31:20,720
Scott: There's a stack of tiles on the table.

643
00:31:21,221 --> 00:31:24,415
Scott: And when the bag of animals runs out, you start using the stack.

644
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:29,696
Scott: But then as soon as you start using the stack at the end of that round game over now, I really like that mechanic.

645
00:31:29,817 --> 00:31:36,318
Rym: And you know, I wonder if we could make a slight variation to Tigris and Euphrates to use a mechanic like that.

646
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,414
Scott: Where we just take some tiles out, put them in a stack.

647
00:31:39,454 --> 00:31:41,626
Scott: And then when the bags empty, start using the stack.

648
00:31:41,646 --> 00:31:41,867
Rym: Yeah.

649
00:31:41,947 --> 00:31:43,998
Rym: And then we have some sort of like end run condition.

650
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:45,303
Rym: Like everyone gets a turn.

651
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:49,378
Rym: Something we, I think we could come up with an interesting variation.

652
00:31:49,398 --> 00:31:50,402
Scott: The game doesn't need fixing.

653
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:50,764
Scott: All right.

654
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:51,567
Rym: Yeah.

655
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:54,820
Scott: It's a little worried about fixing other games that need fixing.

656
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,630
Rym: I mean, the only little bit of stagnant stuff.

657
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:00,623
Rym: I think we could mitigate just by making a slightly different board.

658
00:32:00,643 --> 00:32:02,371
Scott: I definitely think the board.

659
00:32:02,994 --> 00:32:03,215
Rym: Yeah.

660
00:32:03,396 --> 00:32:04,099
Rym: It's just interesting.

661
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:07,372
Rym: Cause you know, you wonder when a game that was 99% perfect was made.

662
00:32:07,774 --> 00:32:14,400
Rym: And then years later, someone has another game that has a similar mechanic and they do one thing slightly differently and slightly better.

663
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,461
Rym: Like you wonder what effect that would have on the older game that maybe they just didn't think of it.

664
00:32:18,641 --> 00:32:18,822
Scott: Yep.

665
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:21,512
Rym: There's not that much else to say about Zoolorado.

666
00:32:21,553 --> 00:32:22,757
Rym: It's a fun light game.

667
00:32:22,817 --> 00:32:24,102
Rym: It's not solved by us yet.

668
00:32:24,122 --> 00:32:25,006
Rym: We only played it twice.

669
00:32:25,207 --> 00:32:25,307
Scott: Yeah.

670
00:32:25,448 --> 00:32:33,907
Scott: And you know, it's a whole lot of, uh, like you got the, cause a little bit of that chicken going on, like, you know, like that game where you pass the cards around with the tokens on them.

671
00:32:34,027 --> 00:32:34,289
Rym: Yep.

672
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:34,751
Scott: Yeah.

673
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:35,234
Scott: It's exact.

674
00:32:35,254 --> 00:32:36,480
Scott: You know, it's like a game of chicken.

675
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,593
Scott: It's like, all right, you, I'm going to stay in this.

676
00:32:38,653 --> 00:32:39,559
Scott: I'm not going to take a truck.

677
00:32:39,579 --> 00:32:43,640
Rym: I'm going to put another animal out there, which is also a lot like raw with the Egyptian slot machine.

678
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,008
Rym: You're like, I'm going to keep going.

679
00:32:45,049 --> 00:32:45,210
Rym: Yeah.

680
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,155
Rym: Well, I'm going to keep going.

681
00:32:46,196 --> 00:32:46,497
Rym: Yeah.

682
00:32:46,518 --> 00:32:49,510
Scott: The difference is that in raw, there's one shared slot machine.

683
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:53,586
Scott: Whereas in this it's this separate ones, you know, there's one for each player.

684
00:32:54,008 --> 00:32:55,716
Scott: So everyone's going to get one every turn.

685
00:32:55,756 --> 00:32:58,228
Scott: It's just a matter of which one you get and which what's on it.

686
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:58,710
Rym: Yeah.

687
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,700
Rym: Now the cool thing is it was made by Michael.

688
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:06,797
Rym: And he also made another game called colorado, which is basically the same.

689
00:33:06,897 --> 00:33:09,047
Scott: It's like the same game, but it's just a card game, right?

690
00:33:09,107 --> 00:33:11,700
Scott: It's like a small portable version and I'm mistaken.

691
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,171
Rym: And I think there's an expansion aqua red.

692
00:33:14,271 --> 00:33:17,128
Rym: Oh, I've never seen this in person, but dude, I've never seen or heard of that.

693
00:33:17,148 --> 00:33:20,086
Rym: I don't know if it's out yet, but a couple of people have mentioned it when I was poking around.

694
00:33:20,407 --> 00:33:23,200
Scott: Let's see, wait, this colorado and this colorado Amazonas.

695
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:23,621
Rym: Oh man.

696
00:33:23,641 --> 00:33:27,079
Rym: There's also expansions for Zula red, like a petting zoo and some other stuff.

697
00:33:27,522 --> 00:33:27,964
Scott: Really?

698
00:33:28,044 --> 00:33:28,306
Scott: Yeah.

699
00:33:28,446 --> 00:33:30,276
Scott: Well, I mean, I'll just feel this yard winning game.

700
00:33:30,296 --> 00:33:32,086
Rym: So of course it's going to have expanded and all that.

701
00:33:32,106 --> 00:33:34,518
Scott: There's three coworker tiles for aqua red.

702
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:38,391
Scott: Oh, there's all sorts of, so aqua red has a dolphin on the cover.

703
00:33:38,772 --> 00:33:44,860
Scott: The Amazonas colorado has a, the toucan, the regular colorado colorado has a chameleon.

704
00:33:46,782 --> 00:33:51,179
Rym: The main good thing about this game is that you can whip it out in like 20 minutes.

705
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,145
Scott: It's one of those ones.

706
00:33:53,225 --> 00:33:54,490
Scott: It's really quick to learn.

707
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,615
Scott: It's easy to play.

708
00:33:55,716 --> 00:33:56,760
Scott: Kids can play it.

709
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,745
Scott: Old people can play it.

710
00:33:57,826 --> 00:33:58,489
Rym: It's a great game.

711
00:33:58,529 --> 00:34:02,812
Scott: Like if you want to definitely, I think it's actually, you know, it, to be perfectly honest, right?

712
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:06,389
Scott: You always say, Oh, if you're introducing someone to German board game settlers, you know what?

713
00:34:06,771 --> 00:34:08,138
Scott: I think Zula red is better than that.

714
00:34:08,299 --> 00:34:13,580
Scott: You know, if you're, if someone has only played non good board games, first good board game.

715
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:16,024
Rym: Well, you know what?

716
00:34:16,043 --> 00:34:16,406
Rym: It depends.

717
00:34:16,485 --> 00:34:25,879
Scott: It's even more, it's, it's got the same sort of fun accessibility park zone, but it, I think it depends just as good who the person is.

718
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:31,304
Rym: I mean, someone like me before I'd seen the German board game settlers would be a better choice for a Rym type.

719
00:34:31,465 --> 00:34:33,612
Rym: You know, someone who, you know, will get it.

720
00:34:33,694 --> 00:34:38,915
Rym: If you just show them that the game is not random bullshit like monopoly, then settlers is fine.

721
00:34:38,955 --> 00:34:41,143
Rym: Hell Puerto Rico is probably fine for someone like that.

722
00:34:41,806 --> 00:34:46,562
Rym: But for someone who, you know, you're not sure Zula red Oh is probably going to get them.

723
00:34:46,603 --> 00:34:48,090
Rym: Cause it's super fun, super short.

724
00:34:48,713 --> 00:34:57,995
Rym: And if you want to play a German board game with a bunch of other German board gamers, but none of you have a game in common, a situation we run into a lot of nerd NYC where I just want to play a game.

725
00:34:58,015 --> 00:34:58,557
Rym: I already know.

726
00:34:58,577 --> 00:35:04,982
Rym: I just want to have fun, play a game, but no matter what game I pick, at least one person at the table has never played it.

727
00:35:05,283 --> 00:35:06,650
Rym: So I'm going to have to teach for like an hour.

728
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:09,683
Rym: This game takes 20 minutes to teach 20 minutes to play.

729
00:35:09,703 --> 00:35:10,286
Rym: Yup.

730
00:35:10,868 --> 00:35:12,253
Scott: It's really quick to play Zula.

731
00:35:12,273 --> 00:35:13,558
Scott: Red Oh is really easy to learn.

732
00:35:13,598 --> 00:35:15,284
Scott: It's pretty just great all around.

733
00:35:16,126 --> 00:35:17,070
Rym: Now one thing.

734
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:19,237
Rym: it's going to be on the way, as far as I can tell.

735
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,668
Scott: And it's already on the iPad.

736
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:22,969
Scott: Yeah.

737
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:24,194
Rym: We'll see when I'll bet.

738
00:35:24,214 --> 00:35:26,763
Rym: They're going to make an iPad version at some point soon.

739
00:35:28,188 --> 00:35:28,569
Scott: Yeah.

740
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:29,493
Scott: It's understandable.

741
00:35:29,533 --> 00:35:33,489
Scott: I mean, it's, you know, how this kind of game could become really popular all around.

742
00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:34,413
Rym: And you know what?

743
00:35:34,594 --> 00:35:35,418
Rym: I think that's about it.

744
00:35:35,478 --> 00:35:36,968
Rym: Short show, but there's not that much to say.

745
00:35:36,988 --> 00:35:37,632
Rym: It's a great game.

746
00:35:37,673 --> 00:35:40,310
Scott: I would definitely, I'm thinking about getting one of the card versions.

747
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:43,709
Scott: Cause that's something you can carry around with you everywhere and play at any moment.

748
00:35:43,749 --> 00:35:43,890
Scott: Right?

749
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:44,635
Scott: It's like dominion.

750
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:47,247
Scott: You could play at any moment, be to carry a big box of cards.

751
00:35:47,267 --> 00:35:48,071
Scott: I'm just going to buy Zula.

752
00:35:48,091 --> 00:35:49,076
Scott: I definitely need like.

753
00:35:49,096 --> 00:35:52,370
Scott: a couple games are like the small individual, right?

754
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:57,511
Scott: The games I have that are just a pack of cards, you know, like safe or like a monitor.

755
00:35:57,531 --> 00:35:57,612
Scott: Yeah.

756
00:35:57,812 --> 00:35:58,616
Scott: Something like that.

757
00:35:58,636 --> 00:35:59,981
Scott: They're more complicated, whatever.

758
00:36:00,001 --> 00:36:10,205
Scott: You know, I really need a game like, you know, the Zula, Red Oh Colorado kind of game where it's just a small thing of cards, ultra portable, but you can whip it out and play it with anybody at any time.

759
00:36:10,265 --> 00:36:12,050
Scott: Just strangers, fricking anybody.

760
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:14,819
Rym: Children, parking lot, old people.

761
00:36:15,561 --> 00:36:18,310
Rym: And I think I'll buy Zilla, red Oh and acro letter.

762
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:28,784
Rym: though, because I need to own more games that I can bring to like an event that is gamey, but isn't like super Germany to just start introducing more people.

763
00:36:28,804 --> 00:36:29,767
Scott: But it's still a party.

764
00:36:29,867 --> 00:36:30,108
Rym: Yep.

765
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:32,918
Rym: Cause I really, especially now I'm in the city.

766
00:36:32,938 --> 00:36:36,818
Rym: I have a vested interest in just finding people and be like, look, these games are awesome.

767
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:43,949
Rym: Play them because it'll spread rapidly through social circles that I think can come right back to me and make more players for myself.

768
00:36:44,892 --> 00:36:45,756
Rym: I'm going to try this out.

769
00:36:45,776 --> 00:36:50,736
Rym: I want to see if I can personally expand the sphere of German gaming in like Manhattan in the next few years.

770
00:36:51,118 --> 00:36:51,580
Scott: Go for it.

771
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:51,840
Scott: Yeah.

772
00:36:52,162 --> 00:36:52,744
Rym: It's worth a shot.

773
00:36:54,309 --> 00:36:56,036
Rym: And I can bring it home and play it with like my mom.

774
00:36:57,079 --> 00:36:57,220
Scott: Yep.

775
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:58,982
Rym: All right.

789
00:38:09,791 --> 00:38:10,493

00:38:15,889 --> 00:38:18,978

794
00:38:19,821 --> 00:38:21,487

795
00:38:21,748 --> 00:38:22,190
