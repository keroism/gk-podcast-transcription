1
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,708
Rym: It's Monday, July 30th, 2012.

2
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:12,952
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:14,036
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,096 --> 00:00:15,320
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,160
Rym: Tonight, certifications and why they're mostly useless.

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,544
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,564 --> 00:00:32,387
Rym: I guess we already kind of spoiled the gist of the main bit there.

8
00:00:32,548 --> 00:00:33,031
Scott: That's fine.

9
00:00:33,513 --> 00:00:34,278
Scott: So check this out.

10
00:00:34,358 --> 00:00:34,740
Scott: I'm checking.

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,650
Scott: I was biking on the old west side bike path.

12
00:00:36,851 --> 00:00:37,535
Rym: As usual, like you do.

13
00:00:37,555 --> 00:00:43,469
Scott: And I'm like, "Hey, I'm going to take me a look at that Intrepid when I go past, see if I can see me some space

14
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:43,851
Scott: shuttle.".

15
00:00:43,952 --> 00:00:45,260
Rym: I think it's covered by something.

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,410
Scott: It's covered by an inflatable dome.

17
00:00:47,711 --> 00:00:48,977
Scott: Those pieces of shit.

18
00:00:49,339 --> 00:00:53,480
Rym: You know, now nominally, the reason for that is to protect it from the elements.

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,705
Scott: That's horseshit.

20
00:00:54,745 --> 00:00:57,720
Scott: It's so that they make you pay to go in the stupid museum.

21
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,626
Scott: My fucking tax money pays me.

22
00:00:59,646 --> 00:01:01,596
Scott: You let me see the Blackbird for free, right?

23
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,288
Scott: Let me see all these fighter jets for free.

24
00:01:05,072 --> 00:01:08,013
Scott: I'm of New York State citizen, New York City resident.

25
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:15,500
Rym: To be fair, I did read somewhere that one of the conditions of New York getting it and putting it on the Intrepid was that we protect it from the weather.

26
00:01:16,601 --> 00:01:19,559
Scott: When the weather is bad, we can put a tarp over it.

27
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,310
Rym: Any weather, sunlight, all that stuff.

28
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,470
Rym: Because you realize even when it was at JFK, you could see it.

29
00:01:25,571 --> 00:01:26,580
Rym: Like I saw it from the air.

30
00:01:26,721 --> 00:01:31,720
Scott: I also saw it when it was on the, uh, you know, the giant tank platform thing going rumble, rumble.

31
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,959
Rym: But when it was at JFK, you could see it from the air train, but it was in a giant hangar.

32
00:01:36,843 --> 00:01:38,700
Rym: You'd only see it from the one side of the hangar.

33
00:01:38,961 --> 00:01:42,610
Scott: If they needed it to be protected, they should have put it in a museum.

34
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,240
Scott: that was not an aircraft.

35
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:48,781
Rym: And there was nowhere but the Intrepid in New York that had facilities to put it.

36
00:01:48,821 --> 00:01:52,058
Scott: How about the flushing with all of the other rockets?

37
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:52,540
Rym: Nope.

38
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:53,967
Rym: The only reason

39
00:01:54,007 --> 00:01:55,498
Scott: that a shuttle is a rocket, but you know,

40
00:01:55,518 --> 00:02:09,060
Rym: Scott, the only reason we even had a chance of getting a space shuttle in New York is because it just so happens that the Intrepid, when it was still used, went and picked up the Enterprise when it did its test flight.

41
00:02:09,381 --> 00:02:10,139
Scott: They should have put it over.

42
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,280
Rym: That's the only goddamn tie New York city has to that.

43
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:18,120
Rym: Other than the fact that we as the city basically funded half the space program.

44
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:18,500
Scott: Okay.

45
00:02:18,521 --> 00:02:21,034
Scott: So there's Gemini rocket out and flushing.

46
00:02:21,054 --> 00:02:22,220
Scott: We don't have any tie to that.

47
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,059
Scott: We just put it there because it's a science museum.

48
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:25,711
Scott: That's all this excuse you need.

49
00:02:26,235 --> 00:02:26,940
Rym: And we're in New York.

50
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,189
Scott: We can do anything we want.

51
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:28,794
Scott: Fuck you.

52
00:02:28,895 --> 00:02:29,440
Scott: We're in New York.

53
00:02:29,742 --> 00:02:36,020
Rym: Yeah, but we have to have at least, we need Cassius belly just like in Europa universalis three.

54
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:36,440
Scott: No.

55
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:37,888
Rym: Anyway, that's why.

56
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:39,156
Rym: Anyway.

57
00:02:39,437 --> 00:02:43,339
Rym: So, uh, there might not be GeekNights kind of meta, but, uh, the rest of the week.

58
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,203
Scott: Well, okay.

59
00:02:44,223 --> 00:02:45,634
Scott: So there's not going to be nice this week.

60
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,018
Scott: So you're going to lose a Wednesday episode.

61
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,077
Rym: Which actually sucks because I read two comics.

62
00:02:51,278 --> 00:02:51,500
Scott: Yeah.

63
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,451
Scott: The week leading into PAX.

64
00:02:54,953 --> 00:02:58,088
Scott: So the last week in August, we're going to PAX dev.

65
00:02:58,108 --> 00:03:00,400
Rym: So we're going to be gone like Tuesday through Tuesday.

66
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,340
Scott: I don't think we're going to make any podcasts during the week before.

67
00:03:05,383 --> 00:03:12,920
Scott: And the week after packs, not only is their labor day that week, but I'm going to Django con and DC immediately from packs.

68
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:15,460
Scott: And I won't be back until Friday night.

69
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:27,100
Rym: Now the reason I bring this up is a Friday morning used to have a tradition every year when we'd go to Otakon of having people do guest shows because after Otakon, we'd go for a week at the beach, our writers retreat.

70
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,020
Rym: So we haven't really done that in a while.

71
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:40,684
Rym: So if any, uh, fellow podcast friends or people who have skills wants to do a guest episode, there's a decent chance that like four years from now, when I remember to, I'll put it in.

72
00:03:40,946 --> 00:03:43,440
Rym: for when we go to like packs, Boston,

73
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:48,619
Scott: if you send me an MP3 as an attachment or send a link in an email to an MP3,

74
00:03:49,401 --> 00:03:50,526
Rym: just

75
00:03:50,607 --> 00:03:55,711
Scott: something like if you do something like that, that or Dropbox, whatever you want to use, send me a link to your MP3.

76
00:03:56,516 --> 00:03:57,240
Scott: I can put it in.

77
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,260
Scott: If the MP3 is already ready to be a show and doesn't need any work done to it.

78
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:07,059
Rym: If anyone's serious and wants to do it, I will provide you with the seed audio files for GeekNights.

79
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,501
Rym: You know, that music at the beginning and the music in the middle and the music at the end.

80
00:04:11,843 --> 00:04:12,869
Rym: Yeah, I can give you that.

81
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,117
Scott: You can say, let's do this yourself.

82
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:14,600
Rym: Yep.

83
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,086
Rym: But uh, yeah.

84
00:04:16,146 --> 00:04:20,860
Rym: So tomorrow night, if all things go well, as in if I get my visa in time, I'm flying to Sao Paulo.

85
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,174
Rym: I'll go to Brazil for the first time.

86
00:04:22,194 --> 00:04:22,680
Scott: All right.

87
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:26,119
Rym: One listener already said that we might be able to hook up.

88
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,193
Scott: Is he in Sao Paulo or is he elsewhere in Brazil?

89
00:04:28,354 --> 00:04:29,120
Rym: He's in Brasilia.

90
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,907
Rym: I don't know what that is.

91
00:04:31,068 --> 00:04:32,133
Scott: Kind of big.

92
00:04:32,153 --> 00:04:32,233
Scott: Yeah.

93
00:04:32,615 --> 00:04:33,580
Rym: There's a lot of States.

94
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,620
Scott: He's in a, you know, the jungle.

95
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,540
Rym: Apparently Sao Paulo is in the state of Sao Paulo or something like that.

96
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,444
Scott: That's fine.

97
00:04:41,484 --> 00:04:42,390
Rym: The state is SP.

98
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,000
Scott: We're in New York in the state of New York.

99
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,247
Scott: That's, he's the same as us.

100
00:04:45,267 --> 00:04:45,630
Scott: Yeah.

101
00:04:46,636 --> 00:04:47,280
Scott: It's not a problem.

102
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,019
Rym: Did you see that thing that was like New York was almost nine boroughs?

103
00:04:52,442 --> 00:04:53,329
Scott: That would have been scary.

104
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,840
Scott: Get the fuck out of the here Yonkers.

105
00:04:55,644 --> 00:04:56,109
Rym: Fuck yourself.

106
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,080
Rym: No, it wouldn't have been Yonkers.

107
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,986
Rym: It just Manhattan would have been three different boroughs and Brooklyn would have been broken in two.

108
00:05:01,127 --> 00:05:07,796
Scott: They should give us all the fricking, uh, cities in Jersey that aren't actually Jersey, like Jersey city and Hoboken and

109
00:05:07,816 --> 00:05:09,331
Rym: those should, that should be the, that

110
00:05:09,453 --> 00:05:11,306
Scott: should all be, that should all be New York city or

111
00:05:11,447 --> 00:05:14,864
Rym: the six borough and Yonkers should be the seventh statue

112
00:05:14,884 --> 00:05:15,406
Scott: of Liberty.

113
00:05:15,427 --> 00:05:17,900
Rym: No, no, you can have a Staten Island Jersey.

114
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,262
Rym: That should be the fifth and sixth borough and someone else can have our land bridge.

115
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:22,788
Scott: Yeah, you can, whatever.

116
00:05:22,808 --> 00:05:23,149
Scott: Yeah.

117
00:05:23,772 --> 00:05:33,146
Scott: Anyway, anyway, so, uh, you know, uh, usually what I do is I buy a new desktop computer because you know, being a nerd, I have to have a desktop.

118
00:05:33,187 --> 00:05:38,080
Scott: If I wasn't a nerd, I think these days, if you're just a normal person, maybe you don't even need one.

119
00:05:38,401 --> 00:05:40,137
Scott: But in fact you probably don't.

120
00:05:40,157 --> 00:05:42,248
Scott: In fact, a lot of people can get by with an iPad.

121
00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:47,354
Scott: I would suggest they don't, but you know, if they only want to do the things they do, then that's what they can do.

122
00:05:47,374 --> 00:05:53,278
Scott: Uh, I need desktop computer for gaming and for programming and for all sorts of things.

123
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:56,720
Scott: And that is the thing that I have that I use more than any other thing.

124
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,620
Scott: No matter how many things I buy, the desktop computer is used more than anything.

125
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,740
Rym: Now you've made it a long way with a pretty old desktop computer.

126
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,322
Rym: You know what?

127
00:06:05,363 --> 00:06:06,148
Rym: a core two duo.

128
00:06:06,369 --> 00:06:06,711
Scott: Okay.

129
00:06:06,731 --> 00:06:11,630
Scott: So I usually I, you know, my first one I bought in 99 and it made it to like oh four ish.

130
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,220
Scott: It was like a five year deal even though it had a slight upgrade.

131
00:06:18,301 --> 00:06:23,819
Scott: You know, it always has a slight upgrade to sort of make, to push it to the video card, usually a video card.

132
00:06:23,859 --> 00:06:24,020
Scott: Right.

133
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:29,557
Scott: So the most recent one I got in oh eight like April, oh eight.

134
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:37,057
Rym: Now what's interesting is that I got my current computer, the one now that I'm using, not that long after that.

135
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:37,660
Scott: Yeah.

136
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,150
Rym: I got it in January of 2010.

137
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,078
Scott: So basically two years is a big difference.

138
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:42,440
Rym: Yeah.

139
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,840
Rym: But oh nine because I planned it in oh nine.

140
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,018
Rym: I didn't buy it until January 15th because I was planned it in late.

141
00:06:49,219 --> 00:06:49,399
Scott: Oh no.

142
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,632
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

143
00:06:50,713 --> 00:06:51,260
Scott: That's okay.

144
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,671
Scott: It happened to be December and then you bought it after new year's like, okay, I got a core I seven.

145
00:06:56,692 --> 00:06:57,397
Scott: Yeah.

146
00:06:57,538 --> 00:07:00,352
Scott: Anyway, I seven didn't exist when I ordered the two duo.

147
00:07:00,975 --> 00:07:05,616
Scott: Uh, but it, you know, it's actually the desktop I have now is just fine.

148
00:07:05,776 --> 00:07:06,600
Scott: It totally works.

149
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,073
Scott: It plays all the games and such.

150
00:07:09,173 --> 00:07:09,737
Scott: Well, okay.

151
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:12,350
Rym: You have a, you'll tolerate lower frame rates than I will.

152
00:07:13,053 --> 00:07:13,395
Scott: Well, okay.

153
00:07:13,495 --> 00:07:20,388
Scott: Anyway, uh, it's because I upgraded it with a GTX for 70 video card, which is actually pretty awesome.

154
00:07:20,408 --> 00:07:29,234
Scott: Uh, like when I put that video card in, I used to have an 8,800 GT, which was actually kind of awesome, but the new one is just, whoa, just blows everything out.

155
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:29,797
Scott: It's pretty great.

156
00:07:29,817 --> 00:07:39,253
Scott: Um, but it's a little too slow to do things like any, you know, work of Adobe nature.

157
00:07:39,675 --> 00:07:40,478
Rym: Here's an example.

158
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,577
Rym: Uh, my core I seven with 12 gigs of Ram, a pretty beastly machine is currently still rendering though.

159
00:07:47,618 --> 00:07:48,120
Rym: It's paused.

160
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:53,400
Rym: And I swear to God, if it doesn't unpause when we're done recording this show, I'm going to cry.

161
00:07:53,862 --> 00:08:03,327
Rym: The elapsed time for, for rendering this video, which is just an hour of a pecs panel, 19 hours, eight minutes, 52 seconds.

162
00:08:03,427 --> 00:08:04,915
Rym: And it's got about another hour to go.

163
00:08:04,935 --> 00:08:05,015
Rym: Yeah.

164
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:09,060
Scott: So, you know, I've been collecting all these GoPro videos and stuff like that.

165
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:17,819
Scott: And I really, even though my computer can do almost anything I need to do just fine and it's not slow or problematic in any way, it's totally great.

166
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,620
Scott: There's things I can't do cause I don't, I don't do them because I can't.

167
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,397
Scott: So I'm like, ah, do I really want to buy a new computer?

168
00:08:26,437 --> 00:08:28,106
Scott: And I'm like, no, I can hold out.

169
00:08:28,147 --> 00:08:30,180
Scott: There's no reason to hurry up and buy it now.

170
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,420
Scott: I don't need to buy it right this minute.

171
00:08:31,521 --> 00:08:34,940
Scott: I can buy it like next year after I hit the five year mark.

172
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,429
Scott: It's not, it's not too far away.

173
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:38,200
Rym: I mean, my wife's my rush is holding.

174
00:08:38,722 --> 00:08:46,736
Rym: I think I can go to minimum two more years in my current computer if I upgrade the video card and get myself to 18 or so gigs of Ram.

175
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:46,997
Scott: Yeah.

176
00:08:47,037 --> 00:08:48,659
Scott: So I'm like, oh, I don't need to buy it right now.

177
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:57,079
Scott: And then I remembered that fricking secure boot bullshit's coming around the corner and I went a new egg and I'm like, let's see how close the secure boot nonsense is.

178
00:08:57,742 --> 00:08:59,073
Scott: One of the newest motherboards.

179
00:08:59,113 --> 00:08:59,920
Scott: I saw a new egg.

180
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,756
Scott: I don't know if it had secure slash restricted boot, but it was like pumping up the fact that it had UEFI.

181
00:09:06,856 --> 00:09:11,257
Scott: and I was like, uh oh, UEFI is a U F I A. That's right.

182
00:09:11,558 --> 00:09:23,623
Scott: So, I mean, it's so disappointing because the EFI is just better than bios, but every actual implementation of EFI that you can buy in hardware has bullshit attached to it.

183
00:09:24,025 --> 00:09:25,492
Scott: So it's like, you know, max use it.

184
00:09:25,693 --> 00:09:27,140
Scott: It's just better, newer bios.

185
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:36,340
Scott: It's, you know, a flash firmware kind of situation instead of an old cruddy CMOS thingy, but they always add that secure boot kind of nonsense to it.

186
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,417
Scott: That's why it's a pain in the ass to install, you know, whatever.

187
00:09:38,518 --> 00:09:38,700
Scott: Anyway.

188
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,552
Scott: So I'm like, crap, maybe I have to buy one.

189
00:09:41,632 --> 00:09:42,959
Scott: When is windows eight coming out?

190
00:09:43,481 --> 00:09:44,829
Scott: Fucking like a couple months.

191
00:09:45,373 --> 00:09:46,520
Scott: It's around the fucking corner.

192
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,028
Scott: And I'm like shit.

193
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:54,907
Scott: Cause I kind of wanted to wait until there was, you know, cause Intel does the, they're sort of like Apple where they do the tick tock, tick tock.

194
00:09:54,987 --> 00:10:00,420
Scott: And I think this, this is related to, I think this is related to the way the factories operate because so many companies are doing it.

195
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,334
Rym: I waited until the next gen of I sevens came out.

196
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:03,998
Rym: Then I got that.

197
00:10:04,118 --> 00:10:04,440
Scott: Exactly.

198
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:05,368
Scott: See what's happening is.

199
00:10:05,408 --> 00:10:06,800
Scott: I noticed a lot of companies doing this.

200
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,572
Scott: I think it must have something to do with factories.

201
00:10:08,995 --> 00:10:12,572
Scott: is they do a release schedule where they do a revolutionary change.

202
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:17,464
Scott: Like our newest iPhone four, look how different it is in the iPhone three G. It's like, yeah, it's a whole new thing.

203
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:20,020
Scott: Then like four S it's slightly crooked.

204
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:21,767
Scott: So you know, same thing with Intel.

205
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,937
Scott: They're like I seven Sandy bridge.

206
00:10:24,198 --> 00:10:26,980
Scott: Whoa, it's completely different from our previous one, whatever it was called.

207
00:10:27,221 --> 00:10:30,696
Scott: Then they're like Ivy bridge, slightly better than Sandy bridge.

208
00:10:31,138 --> 00:10:33,354
Scott: Then they're like, next, you know, next year they're going to come out.

209
00:10:33,395 --> 00:10:34,684
Scott: It's like, boom, something else.

210
00:10:34,745 --> 00:10:37,040
Scott: It's not even bridge is just totally different from whatever.

211
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:37,281
Scott: Right.

212
00:10:37,301 --> 00:10:37,868
Scott: That's how they work.

213
00:10:38,212 --> 00:10:45,260
Scott: And I think it's, I think it's because they retool their factories like upgrade and it takes, you know, two years to right.

214
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,977
Scott: They have it sort of this rotating schedule of big factory upgrade.

215
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:49,580
Scott: Okay.

216
00:10:49,701 --> 00:10:55,620
Scott: We can retool the factory once every year to upgrade, you know, the old process a little bit, you know, anyway.

217
00:10:57,401 --> 00:11:02,328
Scott: So I wanted to wait for the talk, the big Intel update, I want to get some Ivy bridge.

218
00:11:02,368 --> 00:11:04,120
Scott: that was just slightly better than Sandy bridge.

219
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,440
Scott: I wanted to get some big improvement, but I can't cause that's going to come with some windows eight nonsense.

220
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,324
Scott: And I'm like, Oh no.

221
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:13,460
Scott: So I went and I said, well, you know what?

222
00:11:14,522 --> 00:11:16,733
Scott: I have monies, but I should not buy.

223
00:11:16,793 --> 00:11:17,516
Scott: I usually buy $800 computers.

224
00:11:18,362 --> 00:11:19,219
Scott: That's usually what I buy.

225
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,672
Rym: I spent $1,500 on my current computer.

226
00:11:23,301 --> 00:11:23,805
Scott: That's a lot.

227
00:11:24,147 --> 00:11:24,510
Rym: Yeah.

228
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:33,008
Rym: My current computer, when I bought it, remember I had an SSD for my operating system in 2010, like January.

229
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:34,602
Scott: Yeah.

230
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,955
Rym: It was 32 gigs and it cost.

231
00:11:37,177 --> 00:11:37,780
Rym: How much did it cost?

232
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,765
Rym: I'll look up how much it costs.

233
00:11:38,846 --> 00:11:40,937
Scott: So anyway, I went out.

234
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:41,460
Scott: Yeah.

235
00:11:42,823 --> 00:11:44,160
Scott: So I'm like, but wait a minute.

236
00:11:44,743 --> 00:11:50,100
Scott: If I'm really worried about the secure boot nonsense, I better buy something stronger than $800.

237
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,249
Scott: I should get like $1,000, maybe $1,200 computers.

238
00:11:52,721 --> 00:11:56,100
Scott: So that way, you know, it's it's full power, right?

239
00:11:56,601 --> 00:11:58,400
Scott: It's you know, that way it can last longer.

240
00:11:58,481 --> 00:12:00,599
Scott: And I won't you know, the dilemma of what do I do?

241
00:12:01,002 --> 00:12:06,537
Scott: I need a new computer, but every computer is bullshit, can be delayed for as long as humanly possible.

242
00:12:06,698 --> 00:12:06,920
Scott: Right.

243
00:12:08,262 --> 00:12:14,560
Scott: So I go on Newegg and I'm just like, I'm feeling real bad and guilty, but I'm just like, fuck it.

244
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,087
Scott: And I spent all the monies.

245
00:12:16,107 --> 00:12:16,830
Scott: I get a $1,600 computer.

246
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,091
Scott: Nice.

247
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,060
Scott: I'm just like, boom.

248
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,022
Scott: I look.

249
00:12:21,264 --> 00:12:23,680
Scott: usually what I do is I look at the scale of things to buy.

250
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,241
Scott: You can see the prices and the prices will be like, you know, 100, 100.

251
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:34,327
Scott: And you know, like for video cards, for example, it'd be like hundred dollar video card, hundred and five dollar video card, hundred and ten.

252
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:35,638
Scott: And it just sort of swoops up.

253
00:12:35,718 --> 00:12:35,900
Scott: Right.

254
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:42,100
Scott: And eventually it's like two hundred dollar video card, two fifty to seventy five, three hundred.

255
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,440
Scott: And you can sort of start to see, aha, there's that big gap there.

256
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,620
Scott: It'll be like three hundred five hundred.

257
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,629
Scott: And I always buy the one at the top of that plateau because it's like you see like three hundred five hundred.

258
00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:54,058
Scott: You like get the three hundred dollar one.

259
00:12:54,118 --> 00:12:54,320
Scott: Right.

260
00:12:54,862 --> 00:12:56,540
Scott: But this time I did different.

261
00:12:56,821 --> 00:13:00,500
Scott: The scale was like three hundred five hundred a thousand.

262
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,268
Scott: So instead of getting the three hundred, like I usually do, I got the five hundred dollar video card.

263
00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:06,920
Scott: I was like, I don't give a shit.

264
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,860
Rym: The last time I spent more than like two hundred and fifty dollars on a video card was when I got my creative.

265
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,580
Rym: Was it the graphics blaster or whatever it was?

266
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,059
Rym: I spent four hundred dollars on a video card, like a decade ago.

267
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,638
Scott: Sixteen gigs of RAM was one hundred dollars.

268
00:13:22,081 --> 00:13:23,680
Rym: Yeah, RAM's way cheap again.

269
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:28,926
Scott: Thirty two gigs of RAM, which is way more than you could ever possibly need in the present day.

270
00:13:28,946 --> 00:13:32,840
Scott: I'm not going to do a Bill Gates and so you never need that much, but it's way more than you need now.

271
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,744
Scott: It was only two hundred.

272
00:13:33,785 --> 00:13:36,600
Scott: So I'm just like, fuck it to get four thirty two gigs of RAM.

273
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,587
Rym: How many DIMMs you got?

274
00:13:37,607 --> 00:13:38,818
Rym: Because my computer has six.

275
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,320
Scott: It's four by eight.

276
00:13:40,761 --> 00:13:42,379
Rym: My computer is six DIMMs.

277
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,000
Scott: This is maximum for the motherboard.

278
00:13:44,182 --> 00:13:45,319
Scott: Four eight gig sticks.

279
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,469
Scott: Right.

280
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:46,797
Scott: I just went.

281
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,199
Rym: I could get six eight giggers.

282
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,047
Scott: I'm like, you know what?

283
00:13:49,068 --> 00:13:49,937
Scott: I already have an SSD.

284
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:53,100
Scott: You know, I have one hundred twenty gig SSD in my computer.

285
00:13:53,382 --> 00:13:54,129
Scott: I don't need another one.

286
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:55,359
Scott: Oh, but wait.

287
00:13:56,081 --> 00:14:00,880
Scott: They now this motherboard supports the six gigabit per second serial ATA.

288
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:05,559
Scott: And so I went and I'm like, you know, another SSD, two fifty six gig SSD.

289
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,500
Rym: Because I'm going to buy a couple more hard drives.

290
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,999
Rym: The one thing I'm really lacking and now hard drives are cheap, too.

291
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,137
Scott: It's two hundred fifty dollars for two hundred fifty six gig SATA.

292
00:14:13,962 --> 00:14:14,768
Scott: That's pretty awesome.

293
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:16,220
Scott: And is six gigs a second.

294
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:17,539
Rym: Yeah, I'm holding off on that.

295
00:14:17,761 --> 00:14:21,860
Rym: But I think what I'm going to get is a couple of spinning disks, like two terabyte ones.

296
00:14:22,204 --> 00:14:23,559
Rym: So I already have zero.

297
00:14:24,182 --> 00:14:26,918
Scott: So in my computer now, I have the one twenty eight gig SSD.

298
00:14:27,524 --> 00:14:27,728
Scott: Right.

299
00:14:27,748 --> 00:14:28,399
Scott: Which is still good.

300
00:14:28,981 --> 00:14:30,507
Scott: I've got a one terabyte drive.

301
00:14:30,527 --> 00:14:33,940
Scott: that's got my stuffs and I have two five hundred gig drives.

302
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:35,140
Scott: I'm going to bring all that over.

303
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,279
Scott: I'm going to raid zero those five hundred gig guys.

304
00:14:37,523 --> 00:14:37,991
Scott: Why not?

305
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:38,540
Rym: Yeah.

306
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:47,500
Rym: Well, what I'm using my rate zero for when I build it is basically when I have video from a con, I dump it in an archive, you know, the stuff I'm going to keep for future use.

307
00:14:48,001 --> 00:14:55,479
Rym: But then when I'm actually editing a video together with all of it, I'll dump it all on this raid so I can edit quickly and then just delete it all when I'm done.

308
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,680
Scott: And then I went even crazy.

309
00:14:59,103 --> 00:15:00,400
Scott: If that could be even possible.

310
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,222
Rym: Good lord, man.

311
00:15:01,242 --> 00:15:11,180
Scott: Because I had already, you know, I had already taken all the guilt of spending all my money upon myself and I had already taken the realization that I was going to be a big jerk and say, look at all the money I'm spending.

312
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:13,140
Scott: But, you know, it made me feel like I was not a jerk.

313
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:17,143
Rym: You know, the only thing that would make you be a jerk is if you bought arms to mount your monitors on.

314
00:15:17,866 --> 00:15:22,126
Rym: OK, so so here because those things be expensive.

315
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,724
Scott: Yeah, well, let me get through the whole rest of this.

316
00:15:24,784 --> 00:15:25,005
Scott: Right.

317
00:15:25,086 --> 00:15:27,440
Scott: So, you know, it made me feel like not a jerk.

318
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:28,426
Scott: A few things.

319
00:15:28,487 --> 00:15:30,440
Scott: Number one, this computer is still good.

320
00:15:30,821 --> 00:15:35,567
Scott: And I you know, all these kids in the form are always like, no, my computer is so bad I can't game.

321
00:15:35,587 --> 00:15:35,930
Scott: No, no.

322
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,571
Scott: Well, I'm going to give my perfectly good computer to somebody to make good use of because I don't need it.

323
00:15:41,957 --> 00:15:42,120
Scott: Right.

324
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:49,160
Rym: So I offered that, too, for my old computer, which is actually my old computer is about as powerful as Scott's old computer, his current one.

325
00:15:50,801 --> 00:15:54,880
Rym: Except anyone who doesn't live in New York, shipping will be expensive.

326
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,968
Scott: You can pay for it.

327
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,520
Scott: Yeah, but it's still a hassle.

328
00:15:57,901 --> 00:16:03,146
Scott: I need I could use I guess I can use the box that my new case is coming in to send away the old case.

329
00:16:03,207 --> 00:16:04,460
Scott: But here's the other thing.

330
00:16:05,002 --> 00:16:06,196
Scott: My monitors are perfectly OK.

331
00:16:07,202 --> 00:16:08,249
Scott: Why should I replace them?

332
00:16:08,289 --> 00:16:13,079
Scott: It's like, well, if I'm going to give this computer to somebody, I should probably give them the monitors, too.

333
00:16:13,844 --> 00:16:14,333
Rym: Wait a minute.

334
00:16:14,354 --> 00:16:14,700
Rym: Wait a minute.

335
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:17,618
Rym: You who accused me of breaking my D.S.

336
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,578
Rym: Fat as an excuse to buy a D.S.

337
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,825
Rym: Light are now.

338
00:16:21,267 --> 00:16:23,700
Rym: I guess I should get rid of these perfectly good monitors.

339
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,117
Scott: No, unlike you.

340
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,540
Scott: See, you're even worse.

341
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,880
Scott: You destroyed a perfectly good thing as an excuse to replace it.

342
00:16:31,841 --> 00:16:38,926
Scott: I am replacing a thing and making sure damn sure that the thing that I'm replacing is finding a good home.

343
00:16:39,187 --> 00:16:41,679
Rym: I would have killed to have still had my D.S.

344
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,606
Rym: Fat to this day.

345
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,140
Rym: You know how much cultural cachet?

346
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:44,783
Scott: None.

347
00:16:44,823 --> 00:16:50,280
Scott: Yes, fat has none because you can't see shit when you're playing and you lose a Mario Kart because you can't see what's going on.

348
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,760
Rym: You don't need to see in Mario Kart.

349
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,907
Rym: You just wiggle snake it.

350
00:16:52,927 --> 00:16:55,482
Scott: In fact, because it's you know, you can't see the pieces in Tetris either.

351
00:16:56,625 --> 00:17:01,800
Scott: Anyway, so, yeah, what I did is I went all out.

352
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,363
Scott: I'm like, you know what?

353
00:17:02,403 --> 00:17:05,884
Scott: I'm just going to spend it all my monies and I'm not caring right now.

354
00:17:05,904 --> 00:17:08,000
Scott: I'm going to spend even more monies.

355
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:14,126
Scott: And I bought two twenty four inch ultra sharps because this one the one I got here is that one.

356
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:15,240
Rym: That's a really good monitor.

357
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:20,180
Scott: I bought two of those and I got arm mounts to save desk space.

358
00:17:20,381 --> 00:17:20,944
Scott: And you know what?

359
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,750
Scott: There's an arm mount you can get now that's only like one hundred and twenty five bucks.

360
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:25,219
Scott: Wait, what?

361
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,165
Rym: That's new.

362
00:17:26,266 --> 00:17:34,080
Scott: It used to be that arm mounts were like a zillion dollars unless you bought like really, really, really crappy ones that are basically a stick with a visa mount on it.

363
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:34,401
Scott: Right.

364
00:17:34,924 --> 00:17:36,716
Scott: So there's TV ones.

365
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,245
Scott: There's still a lot of money.

366
00:17:38,306 --> 00:17:40,440
Scott: Five hundred dollars minimum and they're hard to install.

367
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:43,340
Scott: And the more articulation they have, the more money they are.

368
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,026
Rym: See, the only reason I'm waiting on that is that someday I will move from this place and I do not want to install like.

369
00:17:49,046 --> 00:17:51,659
Rym: I don't want to assume that this is my desk.

370
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:52,421
Scott: Right.

371
00:17:52,441 --> 00:17:56,020
Scott: Well, these are mounts attached to the desk, not to the wall.

372
00:17:56,603 --> 00:17:57,614
Scott: So that's a plus.

373
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:58,080
Scott: Right.

374
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,480
Scott: And they're really awesome.

375
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,919
Scott: And they're only like one hundred and twenty five bucks.

376
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,599
Rym: I laugh when one day they both just like collapse.

377
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,339
Scott: No, I went and read the Ergotron LX.

378
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:11,579
Scott: So if you're, you know, one of those people, if you're doing like and it's the best thing about them is you do like a standing desk.

379
00:18:12,082 --> 00:18:12,846
Scott: You know, maybe you're.

380
00:18:12,866 --> 00:18:17,180
Scott: and the thing is, you might think even one hundred and twenty five dollars is a lot of money for some people.

381
00:18:17,662 --> 00:18:22,343
Scott: But let's say you're like, you know, poor college student putting your monitor on an arm like that.

382
00:18:23,006 --> 00:18:26,300
Scott: If you're that, you know, you don't have a TV, you're watching all your videos on your monitor.

383
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,920
Rym: That's a really good looking mount.

384
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:28,501
Scott: Yeah.

385
00:18:28,561 --> 00:18:30,560
Scott: You can swing that one to the wall.

386
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,044
Scott: You can swing it.

387
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:36,460
Scott: The cables run through the mount to and it's compatible with my desk.

388
00:18:36,641 --> 00:18:38,079
Rym: So I could put this monitor like here.

389
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:38,882
Rym: Yeah.

390
00:18:38,902 --> 00:18:41,700
Rym: You could like you could swing the monitor around.

391
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,403
Rym: You know what?

392
00:18:42,967 --> 00:18:44,478
Rym: I think I'm getting rid of this little monitor here.

393
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:46,900
Scott: Well, I'm also getting one of those little monitors.

394
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:47,703
Rym: No, I got it.

395
00:18:47,743 --> 00:18:51,240
Rym: If I'm going to buy another one of these, I got to buy it soon so they don't get out of sync in terms.

396
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,120
Scott: And also that monitor also allows the 90 degree rotation.

397
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,760
Scott: So and the thing is, though, it's like I'm going to buy these.

398
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,224
Scott: These del monitors are going to come with stands that are awesome stands that I won't need.

399
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:00,976
Rym: Whoa.

400
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:05,000
Rym: Ergotron for less than twice as much has one that holds two monitors.

401
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,619
Scott: That one is not as flexible.

402
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,638
Scott: But yeah, you know, two daddy two.

403
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:10,225
Scott: Yeah.

404
00:19:10,286 --> 00:19:11,420
Scott: They get they have a lot of choices.

405
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,182
Scott: Ergotron.

406
00:19:12,222 --> 00:19:16,019
Scott: But basically these things only came out like not too long ago.

407
00:19:17,684 --> 00:19:19,000
Scott: And actually this is a newer version.

408
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,640
Scott: The original Ergotron LX, I think, came out in 2010.

409
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,807
Rym: Here's the human scale.

410
00:19:22,827 --> 00:19:25,320
Rym: Hey, even the other brands got cheap lately.

411
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,515
Scott: I guess the relative to they used to it used to be like 250 or 300 for that sort of.

412
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:34,863
Rym: it's kind of like how I needed more hard drives right when hard drive prices were peaking.

413
00:19:35,286 --> 00:19:37,440
Rym: So I ended up buying like a three after the flood.

414
00:19:37,661 --> 00:19:37,982
Rym: Yeah.

415
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:38,284
Rym: Yeah.

416
00:19:38,324 --> 00:19:43,580
Rym: I ended up buying a three hundred and twenty gig drive just because that was actually super cheap and everything else was overpriced.

417
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,440
Scott: I just bought two more two terabyte drives to fill my NAS.

418
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,120
Rym: So now I need a bigger NAS.

419
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:49,904
Scott: There is no.

420
00:19:49,925 --> 00:19:51,900
Scott: Well, my NAS is, you know, has two empty spots.

421
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,759
Rym: I'm saying my NAS only holds two drives.

422
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,500
Scott: Oh, my NAS holds four.

423
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,260
Rym: I'm going to get another NAS and have two for two different purposes.

424
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,367
Rym: No, because I'm going to get it.

425
00:20:00,628 --> 00:20:15,823
Rym: I'm going to get a bigger NAS that has E-SATA in addition to the gigabit ethernet, because then I can use the videos mounted on it in Premiere without a slowdown over my network, because gigabit consumer switches are not that great.

426
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:24,920
Rym: If I'm downloading video through the switch at a gigabit and someone else is doing something else at a gigabit, the switch does not fully multiplex everything.

427
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:25,540
Rym: No consumer.

428
00:20:25,761 --> 00:20:26,980
Scott: Gigabit in my house is great.

429
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,940
Rym: Yeah, because there's just one person.

430
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,979
Scott: Hey, sometimes I'm using both multiple computers at the same time.

431
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:39,239
Scott: I'll be like stream a video from the computer to my HDPC and do something on the computer like a torrent.

432
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,380
Scott: Anyway, say I spent all my monies.

433
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,439
Scott: I'm a bad person.

434
00:20:43,944 --> 00:20:44,958
Scott: Hate me because I'm bad.

435
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:50,839
Scott: But the reason I feel good about this spending all this money is there are two reasons I feel I am not so bad.

436
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,800
Scott: Justification number one, my coworker just bought a new computer.

437
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,231
Scott: The retina MacBook Pro, the 15 inch, which is the you got.

438
00:20:59,251 --> 00:21:03,680
Scott: the minimum configuration was twenty two hundred dollars.

439
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,560
Scott: This computer was sixteen seventy one, thirty two gigs of RAM.

440
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:09,459
Scott: Best I7 you can possibly buy.

441
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:16,431
Scott: I'm making it you got to be a moron to buy that twenty two hundred dollar MacBook when you can get this for seventeen hundred.

442
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:17,760
Scott: second best video card.

443
00:21:18,121 --> 00:21:20,847
Rym: You can buy X 230 super computer.

444
00:21:20,908 --> 00:21:26,944
Rym: laptop was eighteen hundred, including some accessories I bought.

445
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:36,080
Scott: So I'm thinking like, you know, before I actually bought this, I'm thinking, man, if some guy you know, I always think those guys who spend way too much money building a computer and the high end parts are stupid.

446
00:21:36,701 --> 00:21:40,502
Scott: But then I'm like, if someone bought a MacBook Pro retina, I wouldn't think they were that stupid.

447
00:21:40,522 --> 00:21:48,900
Scott: The retina is pretty useful, you know, even though, you know, but now seeing the price of that retina MacBook, I'm like, God damn, it's OK for him to buy that.

448
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,137
Scott: It's OK for me to buy this.

449
00:21:50,781 --> 00:21:56,457
Scott: Keeping up with the Jones and two, I see people out there who just like by, you know, who have less money than me.

450
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:57,715
Scott: Mind you, right.

451
00:21:58,422 --> 00:22:04,979
Scott: They'll just like by car, you know, especially like this midlife crisis, old guys, they're like convertible and like, you know what?

452
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,119
Scott: This is like 20 times cheaper than a car.

453
00:22:08,663 --> 00:22:09,291
Scott: So it's OK.

454
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,460
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

455
00:22:20,161 --> 00:22:23,556
Rym: So I watched every single one of these and you should do.

456
00:22:23,656 --> 00:22:24,339
Rym: some of them are short.

457
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:31,542
Rym: You could cherry pick and go for the cool ones like sodium is pretty cool, argon is pretty cool.

458
00:22:31,985 --> 00:22:34,860
Rym: But I was actually more fan of the ones like a terbium and hafnium.

459
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:36,164
Scott: I think I've done.

460
00:22:36,184 --> 00:22:40,520
Scott: I've seen some of these before and I think might be a super rare one.

461
00:22:41,062 --> 00:22:42,479
Scott: There's one that I did.

462
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:46,340
Scott: I might even been a thing of the day about this one element.

463
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,810
Scott: I forget which one it was that like is.

464
00:22:47,971 --> 00:22:49,300
Scott: you had to handle it very carefully.

465
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:54,040
Scott: And it was like they went to see a guy who was an expert in that element and he knew how to handle it properly.

466
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,086
Rym: Well, what about Liver?

467
00:22:55,106 --> 00:22:56,478
Rym: Morium is one of the new ones.

468
00:22:56,921 --> 00:22:59,698
Rym: Oh, well, rovium rovium.

469
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,659
Rym: Oh, flour, Russia, mad academia, gazebo.

470
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:09,000
Rym: This is these people do an amazing set of science videos.

471
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:23,700
Rym: But the playlist I'm linking to is my thing of the day is a description explanation, commentary and anecdotes video for every single element on the periodic table in order hydrogen, helium, lithium or everything.

472
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:29,022
Rym: It's some of these are pretty great, especially because the people who do it are funny.

473
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:32,658
Rym: Every time there's going to be a demonstration, it's pretty much always.

474
00:23:32,699 --> 00:23:34,839
Rym: can we blow it up or set it on fire?

475
00:23:37,261 --> 00:23:38,646
Scott: Elements.

476
00:23:38,806 --> 00:23:39,970
Rym: And I learned a lot about.

477
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:43,066
Rym: there's one that was really good for how boring it was.

478
00:23:43,107 --> 00:23:43,759
Rym: It was Thulium.

479
00:23:46,542 --> 00:23:52,101
Rym: Anyway, you'll notice that when you think of element names, you think of a certain subset of them.

480
00:23:52,142 --> 00:23:56,720
Rym: There's a ton of elements you probably, like, vaguely know about.

481
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:01,528
Rym: But if someone said, you know, the name of the element to you randomly, you would not think it was Nellium.

482
00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:02,640
Rym: Like a Holmium.

483
00:24:03,502 --> 00:24:05,259
Scott: Never heard of who remembers Holmium.

484
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,221
Scott: Not me.

485
00:24:07,267 --> 00:24:09,178
Scott: OK, so check this out.

486
00:24:10,001 --> 00:24:11,920
Scott: We're not going to do a Wednesday show, most likely.

487
00:24:12,521 --> 00:24:12,843
Scott: Right.

488
00:24:12,883 --> 00:24:15,760
Scott: So I'm bringing my Wednesday thing of the day over to the Monday.

489
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,180
Rym: Well, Holmium has the highest magnetic moment of any known element.

490
00:24:19,382 --> 00:24:19,831
Scott: That's great.

491
00:24:20,096 --> 00:24:20,300
Rym: Anyway.

492
00:24:21,364 --> 00:24:22,899
Scott: So check out this Wednesday thing of the day.

493
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:28,400
Scott: Studio Ghibli, supposedly this is their first ever live action.

494
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,231
Scott: Right.

495
00:24:30,352 --> 00:24:31,079
Scott: And it's pretty good.

496
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,426
Scott: They made this.

497
00:24:32,526 --> 00:24:34,480
Scott: It's not long for a short.

498
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,103
Scott: It's a short.

499
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:38,120
Scott: They made it for an Evangelion exhibition.

500
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:39,121
Scott: Right.

501
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:42,860
Scott: So it's made by Ghibli, but it's for an EVA exhibition.

502
00:24:43,622 --> 00:24:48,920
Scott: And what it is, is it's basically the it's called Giant God Warrior appears in Tokyo.

503
00:24:49,426 --> 00:24:50,579
Scott: And that's exactly what it is.

504
00:24:51,142 --> 00:24:54,860
Scott: It's Nausicaa live action like Godzilla puppetry.

505
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:55,643
Scott: Right.

506
00:24:55,886 --> 00:24:56,900
Scott: There is miniatures.

507
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,419
Scott: It's not CG or anything.

508
00:24:59,261 --> 00:25:06,420
Scott: And it's the God Warriors of Nausicaa appearing in Tokyo and destroying it in a style that is an Evangelion style.

509
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:10,680
Scott: And this is an extended trailer that you can watch.

510
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:23,699
Scott: It's not the whole thing, but it's basically when you see the extended trailer and you know, if you know Nausicaa and you know Evangelion, the extended trailer is enough so that you'll know everything you need to know about this thing.

511
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:24,365
Rym: Nice.

512
00:25:24,872 --> 00:25:25,380
Scott: It's awesome.

513
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:26,721
Scott: Of course.

514
00:25:28,245 --> 00:25:35,920
Rym: So in the meta moment, if anyone is in Sao Paulo for the FPL show two days from now, I will be there in Brazil.

515
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,796
Scott: If anyone's going to DjangoCon, which is the week immediately after PAX, I'll be there Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

516
00:25:43,183 --> 00:25:45,660
Rym: If anyone's going to PAX dev, we will be there.

517
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,444
Rym: So will Emily.

518
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:49,040
Rym: So will our friend Conrad and Avery Alex.

519
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:55,566
Rym: We will all be in academia versus reality, psychology, game theory and games on Wednesday in the Cascade Ballroom.

520
00:25:56,008 --> 00:26:00,580
Rym: And if you're going to PAX Prime, we'll be doing short subjects and gaming on Friday at three thirty p.m.

521
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,939
Rym: in the Wolfman Theater.

522
00:26:03,002 --> 00:26:05,560
Scott: Yeah, Magfest is January.

523
00:26:06,181 --> 00:26:06,384
Rym: Yeah.

524
00:26:06,405 --> 00:26:07,460
Scott: And we're talking about Magfest.

525
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,143
Rym: We'll be there.

526
00:26:08,243 --> 00:26:11,000
Rym: We'll be doing some stuff that's already in the works.

527
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:12,084
Scott: It's a little far away.

528
00:26:12,265 --> 00:26:16,586
Rym: And I was very recently on an episode of Friday Night Party Line.

529
00:26:17,372 --> 00:26:18,379
Rym: Yeah, it was fun.

530
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,540
Scott: Someone in our forum started a Minecraft server.

531
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,038
Rym: It's pretty rockin.

532
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,740
Scott: I built a castle that doesn't look too good, but it works and has a tower.

533
00:26:30,202 --> 00:26:32,160
Rym: Forum, Twitter, Internet.

534
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:32,969
Scott: On the Internet.

535
00:26:33,171 --> 00:26:33,879
Scott: Come look at us.

536
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,800
Scott: Don't just follow us on iTunes.

537
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,799
Scott: I guess if that's what you want to do, that's what you can do.

538
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:45,339
Scott: But if you're cool, you'll come to some other place on the Internet besides iTunes to click on things that have our name on it.

539
00:26:45,661 --> 00:26:45,882
Rym: Yep.

540
00:26:47,007 --> 00:26:49,700
Rym: So certifications, we had an email actually.

541
00:26:50,221 --> 00:27:00,380
Rym: And while we while we've been asked the question before as well, while we do not respond to most emails directly, we do read them all and we often talk about them.

542
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:06,000
Rym: We just don't actually really engage them on the show or respond to them in person.

543
00:27:06,061 --> 00:27:07,880
Rym: But we actually responded to this guy in particular.

544
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,727
Rym: The email from Theo was I've.

545
00:27:11,249 --> 00:27:13,979
Rym: I've been thinking of getting my degree in I.T.

546
00:27:14,902 --> 00:27:20,039
Rym: I was just wondering how many certifications you normally get after you get your B.S How many do you two have?

547
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:20,702
Rym: Thanks.

548
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,899
Rym: Listen to your podcast all the time.

549
00:27:22,261 --> 00:27:23,540
Scott: OK, so here's the thing.

550
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,163
Rym: Well, it's funny.

551
00:27:24,203 --> 00:27:27,649
Rym: Scott and I responded within minutes of each other, not seeing each other's responses.

552
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:28,220
Scott: Basically the same.

553
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:32,380
Rym: We both said Scott's first sentence was I have zero certifications.

554
00:27:32,862 --> 00:27:36,500
Rym: My first sentence was I have zero post bachelor certifications.

555
00:27:38,982 --> 00:27:43,020
Rym: So but yeah, basically now we'll address that first.

556
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:51,620
Rym: So we're not talking about certifications in a general sense because there are specifically the computer industry certification.

557
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:51,761
Rym: Yeah.

558
00:27:51,781 --> 00:27:54,937
Rym: There are other kinds of certifications that are good or not go.

559
00:27:54,957 --> 00:27:56,022
Rym: different industries are different.

560
00:27:56,383 --> 00:28:01,744
Rym: And two, let's just talk about his specific question to start certifications.

561
00:28:01,844 --> 00:28:04,096
Rym: If you already have an I.T.

562
00:28:04,881 --> 00:28:05,483
Rym: or C.S.

563
00:28:05,623 --> 00:28:12,480
Rym: degree or a bachelor's of science in that case, computer certifications are worthless.

564
00:28:12,721 --> 00:28:17,761
Rym: In fact, I would argue they probably hurt you because then it depends where you want to work.

565
00:28:18,082 --> 00:28:25,140
Rym: Well, the thing is, people who are savvy will wonder why did you get a certification from like Cisco?

566
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:26,996
Rym: If you have a B.S.

567
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:27,582
Rym: in

568
00:28:27,703 --> 00:28:28,189
Rym: I.T.,

569
00:28:28,554 --> 00:28:29,020
Rym: the B.S.

570
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:29,683
Rym: in I.T.

571
00:28:29,783 --> 00:28:33,921
Rym: implies that you can deal with any network hardware out there.

572
00:28:33,941 --> 00:28:38,200
Rym: Yeah, so if you got the certification, it's why?

573
00:28:38,461 --> 00:28:39,237
Rym: Like, did your I.T.

574
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,324
Rym: program suck?

575
00:28:40,926 --> 00:28:44,040
Rym: People might not even notice you have a bachelor in science.

576
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:50,144
Rym: And in fact, they will often gloss over that and focus on the list of certifications instead.

577
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:53,260
Rym: And it'll be very difficult to dig yourself out of that hole.

578
00:28:53,563 --> 00:28:54,251
Rym: You'll be seen.

579
00:28:54,271 --> 00:28:55,020
Rym: I keep interrupting.

580
00:28:55,401 --> 00:29:00,884
Rym: You'll be seen as you'll be like shoved into the non degree ghetto forever.

581
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,840
Scott: You're assuming, you know, this is the thing.

582
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:10,304
Scott: It depends on where you're applying, what job you're applying to, which is why you to customize your resume and cover letter if you have a cover letter for where you're applying.

583
00:29:10,465 --> 00:29:11,800
Rym: I've never had a cover letter.

584
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:26,742
Scott: If you're if you're applying at some sort of stuffy corporate place, right, they might be looking for somebody who knows these three technologies that they use and they need someone to like administer these three systems.

585
00:29:27,044 --> 00:29:35,780
Scott: So if you have certifications in those three systems and that's what they need and you've got it, you're going to get that job pretty much guaranteed.

586
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:41,162
Rym: But stuffy corporate places I have applied to or talked to or worked with.

587
00:29:42,428 --> 00:29:47,550
Rym: You if you're filling out a form or you're having your resume and they you know, do you have certification for Cisco?

588
00:29:48,313 --> 00:29:50,547
Rym: list your bachelor of science and I.T.

589
00:29:50,809 --> 00:29:51,840
Rym: as the certification?

590
00:29:52,523 --> 00:29:53,759
Rym: Because that's what it is.

591
00:29:54,201 --> 00:29:57,980
Rym: A certification for most stuff like a plus or some Cisco.

592
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,260
Rym: I use Cisco because that's like the gold standard of B.S.

593
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,128
Rym: certification.

594
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:02,139
Scott: Those A plus things.

595
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,600
Scott: And we're not going to get into the different.

596
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:04,564
Rym: I said a plus.

597
00:30:04,605 --> 00:30:06,740
Rym: That was the other example I gave.

598
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,720
Scott: And let's not talk about all the different certifications that are out there.

599
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,302
Scott: That's pointless.

600
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:16,138
Rym: But those things are all implied by a bachelor of science in I.T.

601
00:30:16,401 --> 00:30:19,260
Rym: because actually there aren't that many schools that give B.S.

602
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,065
Rym: is in I.T.

603
00:30:20,669 --> 00:30:22,119
Scott: and a lot of B.A.s.

604
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:22,600
Scott: Right.

605
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:27,342
Rym: Watch out for those B.A.s in any computer thing are pretty worthless compared to a B.S..

606
00:30:27,362 --> 00:30:34,420
Scott: Thing is, you might be able to most employers might not know the difference, but the education you will get may not measure up.

607
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,039
Scott: It's mean it's possible for like some school to have a B.A.

608
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,359
Scott: and C.S that's actually good.

609
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,259
Scott: But basically B.A.

610
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:43,339
Scott: basically means they didn't get it accredited as a B.S..

611
00:30:43,903 --> 00:30:44,910
Rym: So a B.A.

612
00:30:44,971 --> 00:30:49,519
Scott: is B.S There's no guarantee that it's going to be for reals.

613
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:50,643
Scott: Right.

614
00:30:50,704 --> 00:30:55,680
Scott: An employer might not notice the A versus S. I would if I was looking at your resume, but some people won't.

615
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,517
Rym: Now, the reason I bring that up is that I.T.

616
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,540
Rym: information technology in particular, that's my major.

617
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,477
Rym: I have a bachelor of science in I.T.

618
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:03,903
Rym: from our I.T.

619
00:31:04,647 --> 00:31:11,300
Rym: and it's actually not a commonly known major except in like high roller computer circles.

620
00:31:11,381 --> 00:31:13,500
Rym: So like IBM knows about that.

621
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,578
Rym: They know what an I.T.

622
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,424
Rym: degree means.

623
00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:17,960
Rym: But I worked at a hot.

624
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:21,542
Rym: You know, I applied to work at a hospital after I worked at IBM and I got the job and I worked there.

625
00:31:22,024 --> 00:31:28,895
Rym: But I realized after I got there that they didn't really understand how valuable an I.T.

626
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,623
Rym: degree was.

627
00:31:30,804 --> 00:31:36,620
Rym: And the work I was doing was actually very boring and very below my ability level, to put it lightly.

628
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:40,740
Rym: And when I was like, look, I approached my managers there.

629
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,379
Rym: This was a long goddamn time ago.

630
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,540
Rym: And I was like, look, I could train a monkey to do the job you're paying me.

631
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,818
Rym: Not an insubstantial amount of money to do.

632
00:31:51,122 --> 00:31:57,480
Rym: I could do every other job in this company for and I'll even do it for the same salary you're paying me now.

633
00:31:57,561 --> 00:31:58,720
Rym: I just don't want to do anything boring.

634
00:31:59,481 --> 00:32:02,800
Rym: They didn't understand that I was qualified to do it because of my degree.

635
00:32:03,662 --> 00:32:05,780
Rym: They focused on the fact that I didn't have any certifications.

636
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,403
Rym: And you know what?

637
00:32:06,804 --> 00:32:14,320
Rym: If there is a place like that, you are better off not working there, because if you work at a place like that too long, your skills will degrade.

638
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:19,560
Rym: You'll become one of those people who only like all your industry experiences.

639
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:24,059
Rym: Like if it's a place that wants like a Cisco cert and they won't accept an I.T.

640
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:28,900
Rym: degree in its place, you're going to be in the Cisco cert ghetto.

641
00:32:29,362 --> 00:32:33,140
Rym: They will not compare you to other people who have real degrees from universities.

642
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:40,659
Rym: They will compare you in their minds to other people who did not go to university, but who just have a Cisco cert.

643
00:32:41,142 --> 00:32:42,640
Rym: And your career will be fucked.

644
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:49,060
Scott: See, I'm not really sure if this is true, but my guess is that these you know, why do these certifications exist?

645
00:32:49,340 --> 00:33:00,120
Scott: It's because in the technology industry, even to this day, though less so than it used to be, most of the people who work real jobs in programming and

646
00:33:00,481 --> 00:33:01,023
Scott: I.T.,

647
00:33:01,103 --> 00:33:01,465
Scott: especially

648
00:33:01,565 --> 00:33:01,946
Scott: I.T.,

649
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:05,540
Scott: oh, my God, did not go to school for that.

650
00:33:05,781 --> 00:33:06,369
Rym: Well, look at it now.

651
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:07,099
Scott: It's better now.

652
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,259
Scott: There wasn't even school for I.T.

653
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,126
Scott: until recently.

654
00:33:10,167 --> 00:33:11,439
Scott: And even now, there's not that many.

655
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:11,782
Rym: Yeah.

656
00:33:11,802 --> 00:33:12,244
Rym: So a lot.

657
00:33:12,445 --> 00:33:12,948
Scott: And for

658
00:33:13,009 --> 00:33:13,512
Scott: C.S.,

659
00:33:13,572 --> 00:33:14,940
Scott: there was always C.S.

660
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,020
Scott: school, but enrollment was never high.

661
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:20,360
Scott: And in the olden days, that enrollment was like punch card city.

662
00:33:20,521 --> 00:33:23,200
Scott: It wasn't the learning modern stuff.

663
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:23,963
Rym: So think of this.

664
00:33:24,144 --> 00:33:27,119
Rym: Most people who do what I would consider real I.T.

665
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,019
Rym: for a living do not have I.T.

666
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:29,521
Rym: degrees.

667
00:33:29,903 --> 00:33:34,380
Rym: They either have a computer science degree or an unrelated degree or no degree.

668
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:39,823
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I know a guy, he was a CTO, one of the first job I got at a college philosophy degree.

669
00:33:40,165 --> 00:33:44,544
Scott: He just happened to know enough about like managing a Windows network and Windows systems.

670
00:33:45,046 --> 00:33:48,822
Scott: And, you know, could more of what he did was like manage other people.

671
00:33:48,842 --> 00:33:51,862
Scott: Like he would call up the network operating center and they would pay people to do it.

672
00:33:51,962 --> 00:33:55,483
Scott: And he would just, you know, manage all those people and make sure they got the shit working.

673
00:33:55,845 --> 00:33:58,580
Scott: And he knew enough, you know, technology can get it done.

674
00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:03,020
Scott: And the reason these certifications existed really was for two reasons.

675
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,980
Scott: Number one, they're profitable for the people giving them out.

676
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,124
Scott: And I'll explain that in a minute.

677
00:34:07,606 --> 00:34:15,820
Scott: And two, if you in the era when most people didn't go to college, you needed some way to prove to this employer that you knew the thing.

678
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:24,342
Scott: Like, what if you just learn Cisco stuff because you were on the job somewhere and it's like you go to some other employer and you're like, yeah, manage the network at the last place.

679
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:26,159
Scott: Let me manage your network at your place instead.

680
00:34:26,641 --> 00:34:27,491
Scott: They'd be like, really?

681
00:34:27,511 --> 00:34:28,320
Scott: Do you really know this?

682
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,100
Scott: You went to school for a friggin history.

683
00:34:30,563 --> 00:34:33,100
Scott: What do you know about Cisco networking networks?

684
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:44,150
Scott: And it's like, all right, I got I got certified that guarantee that proves there's a certified piece of paper with a seal on it that says that I know this thing and you need someone who knows that thing.

685
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:45,018
Scott: Therefore, you should hire me.

686
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:50,925
Rym: Now, computer science used to be the general computer degree because it encompassed basically all of.

687
00:34:51,085 --> 00:34:53,320
Scott: it was the only computer degree you can get a long time ago.

688
00:34:53,741 --> 00:34:59,877
Rym: Now, if you think, you know, the majority, a lot of people who do programming don't have computer science degrees, but more and more do.

689
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,868
Rym: And software engineering degree is now we've got to split out.

690
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:11,839
Rym: the first accredited degree in information technology in America did not exist until nineteen ninety two.

691
00:35:13,262 --> 00:35:16,180
Rym: And RIT was the first school to have it, of course.

692
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:16,901
Rym: Yeah.

693
00:35:17,242 --> 00:35:35,780
Rym: So when I went out into the industry, you know, I graduated RIT in two thousand five technically, even though I actually left before then, but I never met a single person anywhere in my entire career who did not also go to RIT who had an I.T.

694
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,325
Rym: degree.

695
00:35:36,345 --> 00:35:37,520
Scott: I mean, well, think about this.

696
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:37,741
Scott: Right.

697
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:43,103
Scott: So you said they invented the degree in what, ninety two and you showed up at RIT two thousand.

698
00:35:43,284 --> 00:35:46,678
Scott: You were the eighth set of people to get I.T.

699
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,900
Scott: degrees in the universe.

700
00:35:49,061 --> 00:35:53,937
Rym: So I entered a job market where most people doing, you know, what is now I.T.

701
00:35:55,181 --> 00:35:55,502
Rym: were.

702
00:35:55,522 --> 00:36:00,180
Rym: it was basically largely untrained labor or Cisco certified people.

703
00:36:00,762 --> 00:36:06,056
Rym: And I was overqualified to a degree that was painful unless I went to the big companies that knew what was up.

704
00:36:06,158 --> 00:36:06,280
Scott: Yeah.

705
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,216
Scott: So now here's the other thing.

706
00:36:07,317 --> 00:36:07,440
Scott: Right.

707
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,466
Scott: It's like what the money making.

708
00:36:08,486 --> 00:36:16,926
Scott: So these companies, these certification companies and what they do is they they're out, they sort of provide that service to those people who didn't have the degree.

709
00:36:17,269 --> 00:36:18,780
Scott: But really what they want to do is make money.

710
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:24,040
Scott: And the way they make money is they, A, they sell you books because the way you get certified is by passing an exam.

711
00:36:24,502 --> 00:36:27,499
Scott: It's not like someone comes in, questions you out and figures out what you know.

712
00:36:28,062 --> 00:36:31,420
Scott: They give you a test and you have to look over on the bottom shelf there.

713
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,460
Rym: I have every book for every Cisco certification.

714
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,598
Scott: I don't think that's all of them.

715
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,320
Scott: Well, all the networks, a bunch of them.

716
00:36:37,501 --> 00:36:40,620
Rym: I have the books for all the network ones all the way up to the top.

717
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,060
Scott: So and it basically is they want you to pass this test.

718
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,199
Scott: So how do you pass the test?

719
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:55,779
Scott: I mean, like if I just took the test, even though I know a whole fucking lot of stuff about computers, I'm not going to know these crazy specific questions using this crazy specific language and words.

720
00:36:56,481 --> 00:37:03,959
Scott: Basically, the only way you could hope to pass the test is to really learn, for example, all the Cisco nonsense, all the Cisco words and show in.

721
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:04,561
Scott: Yeah.

722
00:37:04,601 --> 00:37:12,140
Scott: All these very specific Cisco things, but no shots, no shot, most of which you're never going to use in the real world, which no shot means turn on.

723
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:12,765
Rym: Like no shot.

724
00:37:12,805 --> 00:37:13,919
Scott: You have to study for them.

725
00:37:14,061 --> 00:37:15,678
Scott: And it's sort of like those S.A.T.

726
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:26,408
Scott: study things, you know, where you have to buy the books and study the books or maybe even take classes that you pay for and then you pay every time you want to take the exam.

727
00:37:26,429 --> 00:37:26,530
Scott: Right.

728
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,680
Scott: So you pay to take the exam.

729
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,620
Scott: And if you fail, you got to pay to take it again until you pass it.

730
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:36,345
Scott: So basically, you just give them a ton of money, not quite as much as you would give for college.

731
00:37:36,386 --> 00:37:37,439
Scott: It's just hundreds of dollars.

732
00:37:38,021 --> 00:37:41,155
Scott: But you still pay a lot of money to eventually have them.

733
00:37:41,215 --> 00:37:44,459
Scott: just give you a certificate that says, yes, you passed this test, you know this thing.

734
00:37:45,085 --> 00:37:46,058
Scott: So it's a scam for them.

735
00:37:46,581 --> 00:37:59,140
Scott: And two, you know, like we were saying before, right, it's like an employer that likes certs or understands them and actually wants you to have them is a place you probably don't want to work for to read.

736
00:37:59,381 --> 00:38:00,408
Rym: Now, you were.

737
00:38:00,428 --> 00:38:02,079
Rym: we're talking about people who have a degree.

738
00:38:02,842 --> 00:38:05,499
Rym: I'm assuming you went to a school that has a real I.T.

739
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,799
Rym: degree because it's a B.S.

740
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:11,779
Rym: meaning you're eminently qualified to do most network stuff there is.

741
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:19,919
Rym: And while you might not know the specifics of like routing protocol X, it would take you about an hour to learn it if you needed to.

742
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:33,277
Scott: And another couple hours if you actually, you know, if you're like me, there's a lot of people who have the same degree as Rym people that we know, but they don't know stuff that, you know, Rym might know because they just you know, there are people.

743
00:38:33,317 --> 00:38:33,759
Scott: when I was in

744
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,262
Scott: C.S.,

745
00:38:34,302 --> 00:38:35,911
Scott: there were other people who were just like.

746
00:38:36,253 --> 00:38:37,660
Scott: they didn't code in their spare time.

747
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,434
Scott: They basically just got by barely.

748
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:43,440
Scott: They just did the work, you know, like, you know, by studying or whatever.

749
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:50,139
Scott: They don't actually care about programming and they don't program now really when even though they have the same degree, I do.

750
00:38:50,642 --> 00:38:50,783
Scott: Right.

751
00:38:50,803 --> 00:38:53,420
Scott: So just because you have the degree doesn't mean you know the stuff.

752
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:57,980
Scott: It's possible to get any degree by paying a college enough money and working.

753
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,179
Rym: A lot of these people did know the stuff.

754
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:16,142
Rym: It was more that if you get into the wrong path early on career wise, you stop being compared to the people who have degrees or stop being considered in the pool of people with real degrees and instead are considered in the pool of people who never went to college.

755
00:39:16,202 --> 00:39:23,299
Rym: And while there are very competent, skilled people who did not go to university, you have to deal with the reality of the way people perceive you.

756
00:39:23,803 --> 00:39:24,066
Scott: Yes.

757
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:25,260
Scott: By looking at a resume.

758
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:25,921
Scott: Right.

759
00:39:25,981 --> 00:39:30,924
Scott: Once you get into an interview situation, you can sort of, you know, work yourself up if you're actually good.

760
00:39:31,225 --> 00:39:42,062
Scott: But resumes basically these days, even though there's a, you know, high, you know, high demand for tech labor and low supply, piles of resumes still come in.

761
00:39:42,123 --> 00:39:46,206
Scott: And the thing is, most of those resumes are from people who are completely worthless.

762
00:39:46,488 --> 00:39:47,700
Scott: They're not even tech people.

763
00:39:48,082 --> 00:39:50,260
Scott: They're just sending in resumes to all kinds of jobs.

764
00:39:50,441 --> 00:40:02,180
Scott: And the people at the tech places had to filter these things, you know, which is why you see a lot of recruiters and stuff doing filtering for people, because it's too much, you actual company can't be bothered to waste their time on that.

765
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:02,561
Rym: Yeah.

766
00:40:02,661 --> 00:40:08,100
Rym: Like when I look through resumes, I mean, I've actually I realized how old I am for the last like six years.

767
00:40:08,221 --> 00:40:15,259
Rym: I've been involved in hiring decisions for, you know, I've been the guy that makes decisions, interviews people, and I feel really old about that.

768
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:25,739
Rym: But basically when I see a degree that or not a degree, a resume that focuses on a lot of very low level certifications and there's a ton of them, it's like strike one.

769
00:40:26,221 --> 00:40:26,522
Scott: Yeah.

770
00:40:26,743 --> 00:40:37,883
Rym: Before I even talk to the person, it depends, though, if the certifications, like if a person did not have a degree and they have certifications that are relevant, that's not a strike.

771
00:40:38,124 --> 00:40:54,797
Rym: But if they have a degree that should have covered this stuff and they have the certifications and they're young, I kind of it's a strike because I assume they didn't understand the industry or they didn't actually learn enough in college or they fucked up at some point along the

772
00:40:54,817 --> 00:40:54,939
Scott: way.

773
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,780
Scott: But it's all about what that employer thinks.

774
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:06,239
Scott: There's an employer out there somewhere and there's a bunch of them actually who will be like, you know, they're looking through all these resumes and they're looking for this particular cert and they see that on your thing and like, oh, and they do not

775
00:41:06,279 --> 00:41:07,379
Rym: want to work for those people yet.

776
00:41:07,621 --> 00:41:09,119
Scott: Do you really want to work for that guy?

777
00:41:09,461 --> 00:41:10,104
Scott: No, you don't.

778
00:41:10,285 --> 00:41:14,162
Scott: Well, don't waste your money on some cert because you're paying for nothing.

779
00:41:14,243 --> 00:41:17,680
Rym: If you work for that guy, you're really ruining your future career prospects.

780
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:23,664
Rym: In most cases, you're going because, again, you have a degree that should be the primary part of your resume.

781
00:41:23,684 --> 00:41:28,880
Rym: If it's your first job out of college, I have a bachelors of science and information technology.

782
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:32,080
Scott: The other things you should brag about in your resume are things you did.

783
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,340
Scott: Don't be like, I got a cert because that means you passed the test, right?

784
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,719
Scott: It's like, OK, you passed a test, but can you really work?

785
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,699
Scott: Just because you passed the test doesn't mean you can work.

786
00:41:40,181 --> 00:41:40,464
Scott: Right.

787
00:41:40,726 --> 00:41:42,339
Scott: So an intelligent person knows that.

788
00:41:42,721 --> 00:41:50,460
Scott: So if you instead of the cert on your resume, you have I did this project and it was successful and this is the project.

789
00:41:51,086 --> 00:41:51,799
Scott: I worked on that.

790
00:41:52,001 --> 00:41:54,535
Scott: I was in fact, maybe I was the leader on that or that was my.

791
00:41:54,837 --> 00:41:55,299
Scott: I did that.

792
00:41:55,861 --> 00:41:56,726
Scott: You could point to a thing.

793
00:41:56,766 --> 00:41:59,520
Scott: you made that and that thing doesn't suck.

794
00:42:00,081 --> 00:42:04,740
Scott: That is worth a billion times any degree or cert like I made that thing.

795
00:42:05,482 --> 00:42:05,643
Scott: Yeah.

796
00:42:05,884 --> 00:42:09,320
Scott: Like I was the guy who made that awesome website.

797
00:42:09,542 --> 00:42:10,292
Scott: I did the thing.

798
00:42:10,393 --> 00:42:10,838
Scott: I did the I.T.

799
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:11,363
Scott: for that.

800
00:42:11,948 --> 00:42:13,380
Scott: I program that awesome website.

801
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:13,821
Scott: Whoa.

802
00:42:13,861 --> 00:42:19,379
Scott: If he can program that awesome website that I know about, then he can definitely is an awesome person to do whatever I need to do.

803
00:42:19,722 --> 00:42:20,497
Scott: Let's hire that guy.

804
00:42:20,841 --> 00:42:23,380
Scott: So in a nutshell, it doesn't matter what degrees he had.

805
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,877
Rym: If you have a degree in I.T.

806
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:31,260
Rym: specifically, then diluting your resume with certifications will only hurt you.

807
00:42:31,761 --> 00:42:39,739
Rym: Now, if you want to learn Cisco, then buy one of the books for that and just read it used like on Amazon, cheap, pirate it.

808
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,364
Scott: Do not.

809
00:42:41,152 --> 00:42:41,739
Scott: They're expensive.

810
00:42:42,241 --> 00:42:42,502
Scott: Yeah.

811
00:42:43,386 --> 00:42:46,100
Rym: No, even if you get your company to pay for it.

812
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:52,560
Scott: That's how I can blow all this money on a computer and be a bad wasteful money person because I didn't waste money on other stuff like that.

813
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:56,860
Rym: Now, if you do take the cert, I would actually not put it on my resume.

814
00:42:57,341 --> 00:43:02,223
Rym: But if someone asked me about my skills, I'd mention it in the interview, but I wouldn't focus on it.

815
00:43:02,263 --> 00:43:06,800
Scott: I mean, if someone specifically asked, like, what certs do you have, you know, then, you know.

816
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,420
Rym: But again, I would list my degree of head.

817
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,823
Rym: Like if someone asked for a list of certs, my degree from RIT would be number one on that list.

818
00:43:13,843 --> 00:43:15,580
Scott: I'm also I'm so bleh in interviews.

819
00:43:15,903 --> 00:43:16,146
Scott: Right.

820
00:43:16,693 --> 00:43:17,240
Scott: So normal.

821
00:43:17,582 --> 00:43:18,700
Rym: I'm a dick in interviews now.

822
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:19,828
Scott: I'm basically like a huge.

823
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:21,580
Scott: I'm like, so someone's like, what's first?

824
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,759
Scott: You have like sorts of bullshit.

825
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,220
Scott: But I mean, you know, if I had one, I'd like sorts of bullshit.

826
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,046
Scott: But I got this one.

827
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,740
Scott: Or, yeah, I don't have any of those.

828
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:28,363
Scott: They're bullshit.

829
00:43:28,907 --> 00:43:31,060
Scott: You know, why do you care about certs really?

830
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:31,843
Scott: Seriously, dude?

831
00:43:32,024 --> 00:43:37,040
Rym: When I was I would literally say that when I applied to my job, I applied to another job, too, at a hospital.

832
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:42,307
Rym: But as like a director position and in one of the interviews I did, I didn't even like follow up with them.

833
00:43:42,347 --> 00:43:43,459
Rym: I decided I didn't want to work there.

834
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:49,880
Rym: But basically I was like, yeah, so if I work here, I was basically making demands before they finished interviewing me.

835
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,200
Rym: They were like, do you have any questions?

836
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,579
Rym: And I was like, so what kind of bonus could I expect in my first year?

837
00:43:55,982 --> 00:43:58,220
Rym: Will I get to work with this technology and this technology?

838
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,170
Rym: Will I get to do this?

839
00:43:59,211 --> 00:43:59,900
Rym: Will I get to do this?

840
00:44:00,181 --> 00:44:01,839
Rym: I think I asked them more questions than they asked me.

841
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:08,064
Rym: But that's just us being assholes and bragging because we're old and well, I mean, usually I do that.

842
00:44:08,084 --> 00:44:13,199
Scott: You know, I'm the asshole in the interview when I already have the job and I'm not looking to move.

843
00:44:13,441 --> 00:44:14,357
Scott: But people keep calling me.

844
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:14,923
Scott: Yeah.

845
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:16,139
Scott: I want to make them go away.

846
00:44:16,481 --> 00:44:20,940
Scott: But I'm willing to maybe say yes if they're just everything is awesome.

847
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:26,363
Scott: Like it's like, yeah, I'll go somewhere else and leave my totally awesome job for the perfect job.

848
00:44:26,383 --> 00:44:31,181
Scott: Oh, you say your office is on a tropical island and you only work 20 hours a week.

849
00:44:32,048 --> 00:44:33,639
Scott: Now, 40 vacation days a year.

850
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:34,605
Scott: Tell me more.

851
00:44:34,626 --> 00:44:35,899
Scott: Now I'm interested.

852
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:45,798
Rym: If you do not have not advice to Theo, if you do not have a degree and you want to get into the computer industry, get one ace.

853
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,680
Rym: Well, if you can't get a degree because they are expensive to get from a good school.

854
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:51,193
Rym: I mean, IT tech doesn't are you?

855
00:44:51,334 --> 00:44:51,880
Scott: are you smart?

856
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:52,723
Scott: Get a scholarship.

857
00:44:53,727 --> 00:44:57,827
Rym: If you're already out of high school, it's a little too late to get the full ride.

858
00:44:57,847 --> 00:44:59,500
Scott: It is now too late.

859
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,540
Scott: You have already left high school without going to college.

860
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:02,123
Rym: I mean, you want.

861
00:45:02,164 --> 00:45:04,680
Rym: you want rims advice for success.

862
00:45:05,141 --> 00:45:06,759
Rym: Get a perfect score on the PSAT.

863
00:45:07,462 --> 00:45:09,719
Rym: Use that to get a full ride to any school you want.

864
00:45:10,201 --> 00:45:10,875
Scott: Be smart.

865
00:45:10,936 --> 00:45:11,140
Scott: All right.

866
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:13,100
Scott: No, be rich when you're born.

867
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:13,875
Scott: Have rich parent.

868
00:45:13,895 --> 00:45:14,080
Scott: Yeah.

869
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,860
Rym: Be born in at least a middle class family.

870
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,739
Scott: Be born in a socialist country.

871
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,199
Rym: Yeah, be born in Norway.

872
00:45:20,621 --> 00:45:21,640
Scott: Right now.

873
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:32,060
Scott: So, you know, if you're most people in the world who are not so lucky as to have all these automatic advantage, if you want to get into computers, you can get like the Cisco cert.

874
00:45:32,681 --> 00:45:40,559
Rym: And if you're smart and you have that cert, the cert will get you in the door to interview at one of the places that we said you shouldn't work if you have a degree.

875
00:45:41,381 --> 00:45:45,040
Rym: If you don't have a degree, being at one of those places will teach you a lot.

876
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:52,339
Rym: If you're just the Cisco guy, but you're also smart in a few years, you'll learn enough to go past just being Cisco guy.

877
00:45:52,802 --> 00:45:56,520
Rym: But you will need the cert to get in the door past the H.R.

878
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:56,921
Rym: people.

879
00:45:57,303 --> 00:46:01,260
Rym: The degree is like a magic key to skip the H.R.

880
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:01,662
Rym: people.

881
00:46:01,964 --> 00:46:04,180
Rym: If you don't have that, then you need the certs.

882
00:46:04,641 --> 00:46:08,380
Rym: If you have that magic key, don't waste it by getting the certs.

883
00:46:08,681 --> 00:46:14,663
Rym: Yeah, that's my advice that the certs are great if you don't have a degree because they'll get you in the door.

884
00:46:14,924 --> 00:46:27,200
Scott: One last thing is that, you know, if you got to learn something right and you let's say you want to learn Cisco routing, for example, right, you want to learn how Cisco router works and you don't really you know, you can't afford to go to college.

885
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:31,289
Scott: You can't even afford to go to like community college that will have a Cisco router for you to mess with.

886
00:46:31,857 --> 00:46:32,060
Scott: Right.

887
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:35,140
Scott: Number one, you can pirate plenty of stuff.

888
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:38,100
Scott: You can pirate like Cisco router simulator software.

889
00:46:38,343 --> 00:46:38,545
Rym: Yeah.

890
00:46:38,585 --> 00:46:40,523
Rym: Pirate it and run it into V.M Yeah.

891
00:46:40,543 --> 00:46:45,999
Scott: Or, you know, if you have a little bit of money, you can like buy an old busted Cisco or whatever equipment you need.

892
00:46:46,361 --> 00:46:48,313
Scott: You know, the computer that you use, if you have.

893
00:46:48,333 --> 00:46:50,248
Scott: if you listen to this show, you probably have a computer.

894
00:46:50,652 --> 00:46:51,259
Scott: So you're good.

895
00:46:51,601 --> 00:46:52,324
Scott: You have what you need.

896
00:46:52,686 --> 00:46:59,160
Scott: But if you know if you need some other kind of hardware, you can probably buy a lot of used junky old stuff.

897
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:04,204
Scott: Like if you want to learn how to be like a telco person, you can buy like an old busted phone switch.

898
00:47:04,284 --> 00:47:07,925
Scott: Plenty of companies are throwing them out all the time because they upgraded their phone system.

899
00:47:08,267 --> 00:47:10,479
Scott: You get an old busted one for way cheap.

900
00:47:11,302 --> 00:47:13,820
Scott: Get it to your house off eBay and mess with it.

901
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:16,160
Scott: And then you can become like the master of phone systems.

902
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,400
Scott: Or you can get like Asterisk, which is like open source, PBX mess.

903
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:28,340
Scott: You know, whatever you need to learn, you can get it either as open source software, pirated software, cheap hardware on eBay and learn it on your own.

904
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,565
Scott: But the key is your house.

905
00:47:29,666 --> 00:47:32,540
Scott: You've got to be using the Internet to get the information.

906
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,200
Rym: You've got to have a project to drive yourself to learn it.

907
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:39,160
Rym: Trying to learn something in a vacuum to learn it will almost never get you anywhere.

908
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:44,899
Rym: Like you want to learn to program and you just sit down like I'm going to learn Python no matter how much you study and try.

909
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,064
Rym: You're not going to learn dick.

910
00:47:46,285 --> 00:47:51,439
Rym: But if you think I'm going to learn Python in order to build X and you just build X.

911
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:56,405
Scott: Well, you have to think I'm going to make I want to make a Tetris, but it's a special Tetris.

912
00:47:56,465 --> 00:47:58,140
Scott: It's like, OK, how do I make a Tetris?

913
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,840
Scott: And you find some tools to make a Tetris.

914
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,020
Scott: Then you will learn those tools in the process of achieving your goal.

915
00:48:04,483 --> 00:48:04,725
Scott: Right.

916
00:48:04,907 --> 00:48:06,620
Scott: Your goal can't be learn the tool.

917
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:07,001
Scott: Right.

918
00:48:07,021 --> 00:48:10,540
Scott: So it'd be like if my goal was learn how to use a screwdriver, I would fail.

919
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:19,579
Scott: But if my goal was hang something on the wall and I need to use a screwdriver in order to achieve this goal, I will learn screw driving in the process of doing this.

920
00:48:20,305 --> 00:48:21,319
Scott: And that's how you learn things.

921
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:29,750
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

922
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:35,053
