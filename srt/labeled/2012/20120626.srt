1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,853
Rym: It's Tuesday, June 26, 2012.

2
00:00:10,853 --> 00:00:12,296
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,516 --> 00:00:13,618
Rym: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,758 --> 00:00:15,822
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:20,350
Rym: Tonight, Cards Against Humanity and real money auction houses.

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,268
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,973
Rym: So I've been playing a lot of that Pokemon Conquest.

8
00:00:30,455 --> 00:00:31,520
Scott: Oh, how much have you been playing?

9
00:00:32,561 --> 00:00:36,420
Rym: I'm not that far in it because I just got it, but I basically just beat the Fighting Kingdom.

10
00:00:37,062 --> 00:00:38,560
Scott: Oh, I haven't even beat the Fighting Kingdom yet.

11
00:00:39,647 --> 00:00:41,620
Scott: I beat the Electric Kingdom instead first.

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:41,943
Rym: Oh, fuck them.

13
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:43,013
Rym: I went to the Fighting Kingdom first.

14
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:43,700
Rym: You want to know why?

15
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:43,965
Rym: Why?

16
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:47,300
Rym: All you had to do was hold the flags for five rounds.

17
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:50,114
Scott: Oh, I didn't know the Fighting Kingdom was a flag one.

18
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:50,920
Scott: I thought it was a fighting one.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,764
Rym: So I went there, right?

20
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,373
Rym: Way, way under power.

21
00:00:53,393 --> 00:00:54,560
Rym: There's no way I could have beaten them.

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,020
Rym: But I put my Eevee and basically blocked the guys away from the flags.

23
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,760
Scott: Eevee's really bad to use in the Fighting Kingdom because normal is weak against fighting.

24
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:08,240
Rym: Yeah, my Eevee, though, could move so far that in the first round he ran all the way up and blocked the only way into the part where the flags were.

25
00:01:08,421 --> 00:01:11,580
Scott: Well, he didn't block it because they could just walk there and punch you.

26
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,484
Rym: No, they could only walk in through one space.

27
00:01:13,925 --> 00:01:14,767
Rym: So I put him there.

28
00:01:15,028 --> 00:01:15,730
Rym: He blocked it.

29
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:20,120
Rym: It took them two turns to actually kill him because he was in the way.

30
00:01:20,222 --> 00:01:20,919
Scott: You let him die.

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:21,600
Scott: Yeah.

32
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:23,544
Rym: Pokémon, I played a win.

33
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:25,989
Rym: Pikachu, fuck that guy up.

34
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:32,060
Rym: So what I did is the Eevee held out there while all my other Pokémon ran in and grabbed all the flags.

35
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:35,813
Rym: And in the arena, if you hit a guy, they'd fall off into the side.

36
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:36,616
Rym: They couldn't get back up.

37
00:01:36,636 --> 00:01:37,720
Rym: You have to run back around the back.

38
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:42,991
Rym: So as soon as Eevee died, I put this Plant Pokémon in the way.

39
00:01:43,493 --> 00:01:46,260
Rym: And he just sat there while two other Plant Pokémon did Vine Whips.

40
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,600
Rym: So they basically fucked up the guy.

41
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,760
Scott: Vine Whip is real good.

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,544
Rym: They fucked up the guy who was standing there.

43
00:01:51,225 --> 00:01:56,137
Rym: And that guy standing there, as soon as he fell asleep from Lullaby, I just didn't attack him again.

44
00:01:56,438 --> 00:01:57,360
Rym: And the AI was stupid.

45
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:05,873
Scott: That's a really good... I think a lot of the strategy is figuring out how to arrange your guys to do the most damage.

46
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:09,560
Scott: Because if a guy's in one spot, right, it's like how do you hit him a bunch of times?

47
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,087
Scott: Well, if you got Vine Whips, you can hit him from the sides.

48
00:02:12,748 --> 00:02:16,860
Scott: If you got the guy who attacks over one space, you can attack from behind.

49
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:17,744
Rym: Great.

50
00:02:17,987 --> 00:02:19,099
Rym: That's exactly what I do.

51
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,406
Scott: Right, you can attack.

52
00:02:20,446 --> 00:02:22,760
Scott: So that's pretty much how to demolish a strong Pokémon.

53
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,112
Rym: Granted, right now, the strategy is the Pokémon you pick to determine the battle before it happens.

54
00:02:30,374 --> 00:02:33,360
Rym: And two, the AI is pretty dumb, and I exploit that.

55
00:02:33,662 --> 00:02:34,308
Scott: Really dumb.

56
00:02:34,328 --> 00:02:34,954
Scott: Extremely dumb.

57
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:35,499
Scott: The dumbest.

58
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,653
Rym: It's kind of like how in Advance Wars DS, I couldn't really exploit the AI.

59
00:02:39,713 --> 00:02:41,940
Rym: It was more just like use good tactics and strategy.

60
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,166
Rym: But in Advance Wars 1, on the S campaign, it was basically.

61
00:02:45,186 --> 00:02:51,480
Rym: I know the AI will prioritize a populated APC over another unit.

62
00:02:51,801 --> 00:02:59,740
Rym: So I will use populated APCs as basically red herrings to do what I want.

63
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,160
Scott: Well, because they're killing two units at the price of one.

64
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,180
Rym: Yeah, but they do that, and then I just capture their base.

65
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:12,477
Rym: But anyway, it's pretty fun, and part of what I love about Pokémon isn't really a single player game.

66
00:03:12,517 --> 00:03:13,800
Rym: I'm past that point in my life.

67
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,020
Rym: But I like the idea of battling my friends, especially because everyone plays Pokémon.

68
00:03:18,683 --> 00:03:22,199
Rym: I no longer have the patience to get a bunch of Pokémon and level them up.

69
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,359
Rym: This game, I can do the same kind of battling because all our friends are going to play it.

70
00:03:26,701 --> 00:03:28,727
Rym: There's a little bit more to the battling.

71
00:03:28,888 --> 00:03:32,720
Rym: It's paper, rock, scissors of Pokémon, plus arrange the guys.

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,287
Scott: And the leveling only matters a little bit.

73
00:03:36,327 --> 00:03:40,679
Scott: I'm sure if some guy was crazy level, like 100% Link, whatever, I wouldn't be able to beat him.

74
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:49,675
Scott: But really, the difference between 50% and 40% Link, it's not like a level 50 Pokémon and a level 40 Pokémon where the level 50 Pokémon beats the level 40 in one hit and there's nothing you can do about it.

75
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:58,020
Rym: Facing matters, FFTA style, like I expected, but you can't control the way they face by choosing their pen.

76
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:01,360
Scott: I didn't even realize that facing mattered until people said something.

77
00:04:02,841 --> 00:04:06,580
Rym: Any game that has squares or hexes where there is a facing, facing matters.

78
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:10,880
Scott: Well, I mean, take for example, Battletech, facing really, really matters.

79
00:04:11,521 --> 00:04:13,619
Rym: In Advance Wars, it doesn't, but in Advance Wars, it does not.

80
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,664
Rym: But there's no facing.

81
00:04:15,207 --> 00:04:17,320
Rym: But in this, you can see there was facing.

82
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,463
Rym: But the problem is you can't control it.

83
00:04:19,803 --> 00:04:30,220
Rym: because in Advance Wars, if I move 1, 2, 3, 4, or in Final Fantasy Tactics, whatever way I move, the direction the guy was going when he gets there or the direction he attacks determines the facing.

84
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,892
Rym: In this game, you can't pick the route.

85
00:04:32,952 --> 00:04:34,359
Rym: You can only pick where they end up.

86
00:04:35,281 --> 00:04:50,420
Rym: So part of the strategy, and this is why I'm going to kick your ass in this game, is that much like how in Advance Wars, I optimized the APC to infantry like maximal movement scenario to get to the middle of the map before you can get there.

87
00:04:51,381 --> 00:05:05,940
Rym: The way, among skilled players, the way to win this Pokemon game is to know how the facing will fuck everything up and to move your Pokemon in the early round movement to where their facing will be perfect later and the other guys won't be.

88
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,560
Scott: Also, knowing what types all the Pokemons are so that you're always matching the right type.

89
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,456
Rym: You know, my whole life, I never really 100% knew it by heart.

90
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,140
Scott: The instruction book for this game actually has a perfect facing type chart in the back.

91
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,540
Scott: But you can also get that same chart on like Bulbapedia or whatever.

92
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:29,280
Rym: Yeah, but like when I was younger, I remember like I knew about Pokemon a bit and I knew this stuff, but I didn't really think about it.

93
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,972
Rym: But I felt like, man, I should have this memorized.

94
00:05:32,012 --> 00:05:33,660
Rym: And to this day, I don't have the whole thing memorized.

95
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,960
Scott: This is why Spiritomb is awesome because he's weak against almost nothing.

96
00:05:38,002 --> 00:05:39,640
Scott: Not absolutely nothing, but almost nothing.

97
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,810
Rym: Scott, you know how I'm going to beat you?

98
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,040
Rym: Because you're going to have six Spiritombs.

99
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,728
Rym: You know what?

100
00:05:42,748 --> 00:05:43,639
Scott: That can lose.

101
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,999
Scott: The one thing that beats Spiritomb, you're going to have?

102
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:47,191
Rym: Yeah.

103
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:47,634
Rym: Yeah?

104
00:05:47,962 --> 00:05:48,237
Rym: Yeah.

105
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,200
Rym: Yeah, that's what I'm going to have.

106
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:49,679
Scott: Six of them.

107
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,176
Rym: Six of them.

108
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,498
Scott: I don't even have one Spiritomb yet, so.

109
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,639
Rym: But it's fun, but neither here nor there.

110
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,265
Rym: We finally, we knew about it.

111
00:06:01,565 --> 00:06:07,740
Rym: I played a lot of games like it, like metagame and everything, but we finally actually played Cards Against Humanity.

112
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,820
Scott: Well, now, from what I saw of this game, right, was that it was dirty apples to apples.

113
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,360
Scott: And, you know, I saw it at conventions and packs and such, and I was like, meh.

114
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:35,320
Scott: It's like, yeah, it seemed to me based on just, you know, a distant observation that, you know, most likely it was just apples to apples with dirty words, hahaha, sort of shallow and juvenile, and probably, you know, just sort of a novelty and probably not all that exciting or worth playing.

115
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:41,620
Scott: But we were in the perfect situation and we had a coffee and it was the right thing to play at that moment, so we did.

116
00:06:42,765 --> 00:06:43,539
Scott: And it was pretty good.

117
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,460
Scott: It was actually not as crappy as I expected.

118
00:06:47,482 --> 00:06:49,240
Scott: It exceeded my expectations quite a bit.

119
00:06:49,761 --> 00:06:52,340
Scott: It is not perfect, but it was still pretty great.

120
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:59,219
Scott: And I actually think, you know, if I was going to play an apples to apples game, I would pick this.

121
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:06,907
Rym: Well, what, you know, forget the dirty part of it, but what makes Cards Against Humanity a superior game to apples to apples?

122
00:07:07,408 --> 00:07:17,780
Rym: is that apples to apples, the way the rules are, pretty much guarantees that after a few go-arounds, everyone has shit cards with some celebrity proper nouns they don't know or nothing funny.

123
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,660
Scott: Well, I think that's because it's just the apples to apples cards.

124
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:21,659
Rym: Yes, exactly.

125
00:07:22,682 --> 00:07:34,720
Rym: The primary problem with apples to apples is that it has these rules that are set up where you can't easily refresh your stuff, coupled with the fact that the cards are pretty family-friendly and milquetoast, yet, look at our experience.

126
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,953
Rym: What were the answers that were always like?

127
00:07:36,993 --> 00:07:37,860
Rym: the guaranteed wins?

128
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,558
Rym: The horrible ones.

129
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,558
Rym: So this is a game of make the most racist joke you can.

130
00:07:43,981 --> 00:07:46,100
Scott: Because nerds are horrible people, is that what you're saying?

131
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:51,740
Rym: No, what I'm saying is that we like, this is a game for black humor, and black humor is best humor.

132
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:52,918
Scott: For nerds.

133
00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:00,520
Rym: But also, you know, when we played, it was a lot of like dark humor that was tied to sort of social commentary.

134
00:08:00,921 --> 00:08:01,979
Scott: What was the one I did?

135
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:06,740
Rym: Oh, it was about like Soviet Union crippling poverty, I forget exactly what it was.

136
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,980
Scott: No, no, not the one where I put the two books together.

137
00:08:09,764 --> 00:08:10,359
Rym: I don't remember.

138
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:13,680
Scott: It was, um, oh Jesus, I can't remember, it was really good.

139
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,640
Rym: All I know is you had a really good one at one point, but I won solely because I had the card Fiery Poops.

140
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,400
Rym: Fiery Poops I think is the Trump card.

141
00:08:21,662 --> 00:08:23,840
Scott: I was the overall winner by a large margin.

142
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,299
Rym: Yeah, you had a run at the end.

143
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:26,639
Scott: I had a run the whole time.

144
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,898
Rym: Yeah, but you know what?

145
00:08:28,961 --> 00:08:33,260
Rym: If you don't already own apples to apples, fuck that game, buy cards against humanity.

146
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:36,120
Scott: Well, I mean, alright, so let's talk about what's different, right?

147
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:41,100
Scott: So, first of all, you have these cards that have like multiple card plays.

148
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:44,680
Scott: So it'll be like one card was like blank plus blank equals blank.

149
00:08:44,961 --> 00:08:47,300
Rym: Now at first I was like, oh, that's a pain in the ass.

150
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,760
Rym: But after we started playing, those ended up giving the funniest answers usually.

151
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,680
Rym: And they serve a second purpose of letting you refresh your hand more quickly.

152
00:08:57,101 --> 00:09:00,420
Scott: But it was annoying because you had to play your cards in a certain order.

153
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:06,440
Scott: And then the person who was the current, you know, master had to sort of look away and figure out.

154
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,780
Scott: And you know, it was a little, the logistics of those cards were slightly clunky.

155
00:09:11,303 --> 00:09:13,700
Scott: And they could have done something to alleviate that problem.

156
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,992
Rym: But at the same time, it allows such, you know, apples to.

157
00:09:17,053 --> 00:09:18,620
Rym: apples only has one type of card.

158
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,148
Scott: Yeah, it's, what is it?

159
00:09:20,249 --> 00:09:21,620
Scott: Adjective goes with the noun, right?

160
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:28,140
Rym: But this is like in M. Night Shyamalan's new movie, Bruce Willis discovers that blank had really been blank all along.

161
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,349
Scott: It's almost like match game, right?

162
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,160
Rym: Robo Hitler had actually been fiery poops all along.

163
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,620
Scott: It's Mad Libs match game situation.

164
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:40,140
Rym: I was about to say it's Mad Libs match game with black humor for nerds.

165
00:09:40,361 --> 00:09:40,743
Scott: Right.

166
00:09:42,173 --> 00:09:43,340
Scott: Another key difference, right?

167
00:09:43,521 --> 00:09:45,839
Scott: And you could do this in apples to apples if you wanted to.

168
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:48,340
Scott: And I don't know if this was, I didn't actually read the rules.

169
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,280
Scott: Someone else just told us and we sort of knew apples to apples anyway, right?

170
00:09:51,521 --> 00:09:54,560
Scott: So, but the ghost hand, the ghost hand is genius.

171
00:09:54,941 --> 00:09:57,500
Rym: The ghost hand is officially Conrad Kraling at this point.

172
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,279
Rym: But I digress.

173
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:04,340
Scott: So the way the ghost hand works is basically you're, let's say it's just a normal, you know, something, something blank.

174
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:10,680
Scott: So everyone puts in a card, but then you also take one random card and put it in there and shuffle it up.

175
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,400
Rym: Now this seems like, all right, what effect does that have?

176
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:22,860
Rym: One, it proves that this game is not just random because unless your friends cannot collectively pass the Turing test, the ghost hand's not going to win.

177
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:23,563
Scott: Right.

178
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,060
Scott: I mean, it's, it's very unlikely.

179
00:10:25,561 --> 00:10:27,540
Scott: I mean, the ghost hand won like three or four cards.

180
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,199
Rym: The ghost hand won six points.

181
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:29,752
Scott: Did it?

182
00:10:29,794 --> 00:10:29,899
Scott: Okay.

183
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,201
Rym: Yeah.

184
00:10:30,321 --> 00:10:35,820
Rym: And the few times it won, it like, no one's like, you know, one would win and then everyone's like, all right, who is this it?

185
00:10:36,221 --> 00:10:38,619
Rym: And then simultaneously we'd all go, no way.

186
00:10:39,641 --> 00:10:40,240
Scott: Yeah, but basically.

187
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:40,977
Rym: Ghost hand?

188
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,157
Scott: Ghost hand.

189
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:50,080
Scott: But number one, there's a slight problem in that a dishonest player could easily lie and pretend to be the ghost hand.

190
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:58,969
Scott: So for example, if I had cheated, which I did not, I could have collected all of six of the ghost hand points in addition to my points and no one else to be able to dispute it.

191
00:10:59,512 --> 00:11:00,296
Scott: because, right?

192
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,020
Scott: I actually thought of a solution.

193
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:04,967
Rym: So did I. Let's see.

194
00:11:05,008 --> 00:11:06,100
Rym: First, I'll tell you my solution.

195
00:11:06,221 --> 00:11:06,819
Rym: See if it's the same.

196
00:11:07,161 --> 00:11:13,780
Rym: What I would do, the person to the right of the dealer draws the ghost hand, looks at it first and then puts it down.

197
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:22,900
Rym: Now then two people have to collude or the person to the right of the dealer has to collude, makes it much less likely that someone will cheat.

198
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,660
Scott: But the person to the right of the dealer is the cheater.

199
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,303
Rym: Exactly.

200
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:28,540
Rym: The other option that isn't as fun is everyone but the dealer.

201
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,645
Scott: That's my solution.

202
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:31,580
Scott: Everyone but the dealer looks at the ghost card.

203
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,060
Rym: That ruins that moment of, oh, ghost hand, no.

204
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,246
Scott: I came up with yet another solution.

205
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:43,920
Scott: is that somebody doesn't look and photographs the ghost card with a camera.

206
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,839
Rym: That would be a pain in the ass.

207
00:11:45,766 --> 00:11:47,080
Scott: Just a cell phone camera, just like click.

208
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,079
Rym: It's still a pain in the ass unless you had a clear table.

209
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,578
Scott: No, you just click and then you put it in.

210
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,000
Rym: Yeah, another answer is everyone lays the cards out, right?

211
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,879
Rym: And have the dealer close their eyes just while this is going on.

212
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:08,280
Rym: And once they're all out, someone takes the ghost hand, puts it down in a spot somewhere and everyone knows that spot is the ghost hand.

213
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:08,979
Scott: Yeah, you could do that.

214
00:12:09,422 --> 00:12:11,758
Scott: You sort of have to do that anyway when it's the multi-card job.

215
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,920
Rym: No, you still lose the, ah, ghost hand.

216
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,920
Rym: But at least you don't know what the ghost hand was so you might still laugh.

217
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,640
Scott: That's true.

218
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:27,400
Rym: But there's also the mechanic that in this game you can give up a victory point to refresh your hand.

219
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,233
Rym: That actually adds some strategy, like winning.

220
00:12:31,273 --> 00:12:32,700
Rym: this game is not random.

221
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:37,620
Scott: I did it once and it actually, I got a run after the end of the game so I think it might have worked for me.

222
00:12:37,922 --> 00:12:39,279
Scott: I don't think anyone else did it at all.

223
00:12:40,081 --> 00:12:41,652
Scott: I did it once towards the end of the game.

224
00:12:41,712 --> 00:12:42,720
Scott: I was winning by a little.

225
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,520
Scott: I did it once to clear out a bunch of crap and then I scored a whole bunch of points.

226
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:52,099
Rym: But basically Cards Against Humanity wins because one, the rules are tighter, more well thought out.

227
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,880
Rym: Two, it's more a real game, like winning actually matters a lot more.

228
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,220
Scott: It's funnier but that might just be because we've played out apples to apples.

229
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,804
Rym: No, well, you think that.

230
00:13:01,884 --> 00:13:04,190
Rym: but three, apples to apples.

231
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:13,580
Rym: cards I don't think have nearly as much longevity as these because one, this game has a fuck ton of cards without any coming expansions or anything.

232
00:13:13,761 --> 00:13:15,039
Scott: It does have a lot of cards.

233
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,449
Scott: And two, the cards are really, really varied.

234
00:13:20,348 --> 00:13:20,637
Scott: They are.

235
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:23,460
Rym: Both in content and the way they are used.

236
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,019
Scott: It's only about 20% poop jokes.

237
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:30,680
Rym: But all these factors combine because when do people laugh the most in apples to apples?

238
00:13:31,081 --> 00:13:34,659
Rym: It's when someone plays the really bad one.

239
00:13:35,241 --> 00:13:37,067
Rym: This game is just really bad one.

240
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,475
Rym: so for someone to trump that, they have to play one.

241
00:13:39,515 --> 00:13:40,278
Rym: that's so bad.

242
00:13:40,518 --> 00:13:43,159
Rym: you laugh but you cringe just a little bit.

243
00:13:44,412 --> 00:13:45,180
Rym: It was great fun.

244
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:49,080
Scott: Yeah, there could definitely be expansions though and that would not hurt.

245
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,116
Rym: I think there will be.

246
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:50,749
Rym: I hope so.

247
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:59,090
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

248
00:14:00,171 --> 00:14:00,709
Rym: Got a thing of the day?

249
00:14:00,892 --> 00:14:01,288
Scott: I sure do.

250
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:01,749
Scott: Got a thing?

251
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,549
Scott: On the NeoGaf where I don't go.

252
00:14:03,931 --> 00:14:06,770
Rym: Oh, where our friend Kuyohoga posted his infamous words.

253
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:10,310
Scott: Somebody posted a link to this NeoGaf thread which I did see.

254
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:11,930
Scott: I think it posted it on Twitter.

255
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,450
Scott: Basically what's going on here, it is self explanatory when I tell you the title.

256
00:14:16,953 --> 00:14:19,790
Scott: It is the NeoGaf PC Low Setting Screenshot Thread.

257
00:14:21,271 --> 00:14:26,590
Scott: People take PC games, put the graphical settings to rock bottom and take some screenshots.

258
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:27,869
Rym: Oh my god, I wish.

259
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,509
Scott: And it's a whole thread of just that.

260
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:30,350
Scott: It's pretty awesome.

261
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:33,970
Rym: So back in the day, I had my Pentium 200.

262
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,190
Rym: Not Pentium 2, Pentium.

263
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:41,609
Rym: And I would play Quake 2 at LAN parties or I'd play Quake 2 semi-competitively.

264
00:14:42,656 --> 00:14:44,510
Rym: In order to maximize my ability.

265
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,210
Rym: One, I played FOV 110.

266
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:51,670
Rym: But two, I set all the settings all the way down.

267
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,910
Rym: And the gamma and I basically fucked that game.

268
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,390
Rym: The game didn't even look like a game.

269
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:03,430
Rym: It looked like these high contrast, vague shapes and bland textures in a fish ball.

270
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,830
Rym: And I was just clicking on things in the fish ball.

271
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:16,449
Scott: See, on the one hand, what's cool about these screenshots is some of them, they just remove all textures because the game only comes with high res textures and putting the settings down.

272
00:15:17,391 --> 00:15:21,670
Scott: So in effect, you're actually making the game look artistically different.

273
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,489
Scott: It has different shaders and stuff like that because you put it down so low.

274
00:15:27,331 --> 00:15:31,210
Scott: And sometimes it actually gives a pretty cool effect that can improve upon the game.

275
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:36,910
Scott: Or maybe not improve, but give it a completely different feel without necessarily being objectively worse.

276
00:15:37,232 --> 00:15:40,570
Rym: Well, sometimes that lo-fi business, remember Gravity Bone?

277
00:15:41,171 --> 00:15:44,730
Rym: That was really lo-fi, but that actually added a lot to the experience.

278
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:54,950
Scott: And it's also amazing on how some of these games, where even with the settings incredibly low, they still look just fine and pretty awesome even though the settings are all the way down.

279
00:15:55,070 --> 00:16:03,041
Scott: Whereas others, you put the settings all the way down and Doom 3, depending on what you're looking at, some of these shots are like, "Whoa, look at that monster.

280
00:16:03,081 --> 00:16:03,825
Scott: He's got like five

281
00:16:03,885 --> 00:16:04,428
Scott: polygons.".

282
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,862
Scott: "He turned into a rock monster instead of a

283
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:07,244
Scott: zombie.".

284
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:12,748
Scott: And some of the screenshots are like, "Whoa, that guy looks cool, sort of cel-shady because the graphics are all the way

285
00:16:12,768 --> 00:16:13,029
Scott: down.".

286
00:16:13,716 --> 00:16:14,649
Scott: It's a mixed bag.

287
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:20,590
Rym: It's funny because low settings like that is both an exploratory thing and, for competitive play, a strategy.

288
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:21,911
Scott: Yeah, depending.

289
00:16:21,931 --> 00:16:25,356
Scott: You can get higher contrast, easier to notice guys, stuff like that.

290
00:16:35,712 --> 00:16:45,990
Rym: Before that, back when OpenGL was something kind of new, and 100 FPS was basically impossible without doing mad tweaks.

291
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,326
Scott: Well, it doesn't matter because your monitor wasn't going to go 100 FPS.

292
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:49,607
Rym: My monitor?

293
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,402
Scott: I guess nowadays...

294
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,130
Rym: I had that 19 inch and I spent a buttload of money on that thing.

295
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,406
Scott: What was the vertical sync on that?

296
00:16:55,406 --> 00:16:56,078
Scott: 75? 100

297
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:56,407
Scott: hertz.

298
00:16:56,754 --> 00:16:58,395
Scott: It wasn't 100.

299
00:16:58,395 --> 00:16:59,018
Rym: Yeah, it was 100 hertz.

300
00:16:59,078 --> 00:16:59,922
Rym: And you know what?

301
00:16:59,943 --> 00:17:01,390
Rym: It made a high-pitched whine.

302
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:04,280
Scott: And nowadays, if you get a 3D fancy, you can get 120.

303
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,223
Scott: That's about the best you can do.

304
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,690
Rym: Yeah, well nowadays it's LCDs and everything's different.

305
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:09,868
Scott: Still 75 is all you're going to really get.

306
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,010
Rym: I pretty much lock everything at 60 these days.

307
00:17:12,451 --> 00:17:13,729
Scott: Yeah, 60, 75, something like that.

308
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:20,430
Rym: Yeah, though on my current computer, because my video card's a few generations old, I actually turn off vertical sync on some games.

309
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:21,693
Scott: Well, it depends.

310
00:17:21,753 --> 00:17:24,104
Scott: If the game, if I can render the 60 or 75 frames reliably...

311
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:25,693
Rym: I can't.

312
00:17:25,713 --> 00:17:26,628
Rym: If I can't, I need...

313
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,857
Scott: For the game, then I'll vertical sync.

314
00:17:27,896 --> 00:17:30,210
Scott: If I can't and it starts tearing, then I turn it off.

315
00:17:30,532 --> 00:17:32,649
Rym: Well, it can't tear with vertical sync on.

316
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:33,540
Rym: No.

317
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,440
Rym: It'll stutter, but it won't tear.

318
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,170
Rym: You get tearing if you turn vertical sync off.

319
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,810
Rym: I would rather have tearing than ever have a frame rate drop.

320
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:41,569
Scott: Right, exactly.

321
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,690
Rym: Because aesthetics are nice, but... Well, at least I'll put it this way.

322
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,450
Rym: In a game of dexterity and execution skill...

323
00:17:47,912 --> 00:17:48,810
Scott: Yeah, you need that speed.

324
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:57,749
Rym: Yes, but if it's like, I don't know, some Halo kind of game, don't really need the absolute 60 FPS.

325
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,910
Rym: So I'll let the non-tearing happen.

326
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:03,030
Rym: But anyway, so this is a non-gaming related thing.

327
00:18:03,632 --> 00:18:06,150
Rym: This is a video of how hot dogs are made, and you know what?

328
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:10,710
Rym: This machine, what is making hot dogs, is pretty goddamn amazing.

329
00:18:11,331 --> 00:18:14,690
Scott: Yeah, and it's like you think, oh, the hot dog factory, that's going to be way gross.

330
00:18:14,952 --> 00:18:15,987
Scott: It's not way gross at all.

331
00:18:16,531 --> 00:18:18,709
Rym: In fact, I kind of wanted a hot dog after I watched it.

332
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:19,473
Scott: I want hot dogs right now.

333
00:18:19,494 --> 00:18:24,330
Scott: They take the meat, they turn it into mush, they put it in wieners, they cook them, and then they put them in a package.

334
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:29,330
Rym: The parts I liked are one, when they're adding like pepper or seasoning or salt to the hot dogs.

335
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:34,070
Rym: You guys opening like a 50 pound bag of salt and pouring it into a vat.

336
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:39,470
Scott: You know, you make cookies in your house, you use like 3/4 cups of sugar, maybe a cup and a half of sugar.

337
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,636
Rym: What if you're making 300,000 cookies an hour?

338
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,789
Scott: Right, you're going to open up a huge ass bag of sugar.

339
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:51,870
Rym: The other thing is, there's the one machine that's like cutting the casings off of the hot dogs.

340
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:58,230
Rym: It is amazing how many, like the hot dogs are going by so fast, they look like they're not moving.

341
00:18:58,311 --> 00:19:00,670
Rym: Like there's a strobe light because they're going so fast.

342
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,990
Scott: It's not just the speed that's impressive, right?

343
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,310
Rym: The sheer precision?

344
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:09,608
Scott: It's the precision of how it does this thing, but it does it so exactly at such speed.

345
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:15,810
Rym: If you want an interesting career that people don't tell you about, you don't want to be factory line worker.

346
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:18,790
Rym: You want to be an engineer who tools factories.

347
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,410
Scott: Yeah, so it's like, you know, you can go and design a machine.

348
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,464
Rym: Yeah, they come to you and they're like, look, our machine processes 100,000 hot dogs a minute.

349
00:19:27,071 --> 00:19:29,560
Rym: We really need to get it up to 150,000.

350
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,804
Rym: How can we make it faster?

351
00:19:31,085 --> 00:19:32,410
Rym: You're the engineer, figure it out.

352
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,170
Scott: Yeah, this is the slowest machine in the factory.

353
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:42,010
Scott: You know, it's holding up because this machine already can go faster, but we're not feeding into it fast enough from the previous machine.

354
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:46,370
Rym: This thing is fast enough to where the factory could power a hot dog machine gun.

355
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:52,090
Scott: I think it's fast enough to where it's not possible for all of humanity to eat the hot dogs.

356
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,549
Rym: We're building up a strategic reserve of hot dogs.

357
00:19:55,811 --> 00:19:58,684
Scott: Everyone in the whole world just ate hot dogs and nothing but hot dogs.

358
00:19:58,704 --> 00:20:00,090
Scott: This machine would make hot dogs.

359
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,250
Scott: Assuming the meat came into the factory fast enough.

360
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:06,650
Rym: What's the name of that more recently famous power eater?

361
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:08,975
Rym: The eating contest?

362
00:20:08,996 --> 00:20:10,890
Rym: The guy who can eat like the ridiculous number of hot dogs?

363
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,808
Rym: Not Koyabashi or whatever his name is.

364
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:15,030
Rym: Oh, it's Kobayashi and it's Chestnut.

365
00:20:15,892 --> 00:20:16,628
Rym: I don't remember.

366
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,730
Scott: Joey Chestnut and Kobayashi are the famous guys.

367
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:19,600
Scott: Yeah, I forgot their names.

368
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:20,390
Rym: Anyway.

369
00:20:20,893 --> 00:20:21,939
Scott: I think that's the July.

370
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,690
Scott: 4th of July is the hot dog eating contest.

371
00:20:23,911 --> 00:20:24,201
Rym: Oh yeah.

372
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,270
Scott: I'm not interested in that at all.

373
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:26,550
Rym: No.

374
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,350
Rym: So anyway, because they don't chew and I like to chew.

375
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:35,571
Rym: But anyway, in the meta moment, the book club book, we're doing the show on Thursday, Qteen 84.

376
00:20:35,571 --> 00:20:37,690
Scott: If you haven't finished reading it yet, it's a podcast.

377
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:41,290
Scott: You can listen to the episode anytime for the rest of your life as long as we keep the servers running.

378
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,980
Rym: The book was pretty damn good.

379
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,409
Rym: I highly enjoyed it.

380
00:20:44,871 --> 00:20:49,450
Rym: And I want to find out from all of you who've read more Murakami books, how many of them involve an ear fetish?

381
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:50,430
Scott: All of them.

382
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,050
Rym: Because I hear it's all of them.

383
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:52,710
Scott: That's what I hear as well.

384
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:53,709
Scott: Or at least most of them.

385
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:56,170
Scott: Why don't you pick another one as your next book club book?

386
00:20:56,311 --> 00:20:59,189
Rym: I got to decide what the next book club book is going to be, so don't cross me.

387
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:03,185
Rym: Because if you cross me in the next 48 hours, it's going to be nonfiction.

388
00:21:03,205 --> 00:21:04,230
Rym: It's going to be a thousand pages.

389
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,909
Scott: I've already picked my next book club book.

390
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,209
Rym: What are you going to tell us?

391
00:21:07,456 --> 00:21:07,627
Rym: No.

392
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,164
Rym: Because I might pick Aristophanes.

393
00:21:09,224 --> 00:21:09,710
Rym: Watch out.

394
00:21:09,991 --> 00:21:10,970
Rym: Who's Aristophanes?

395
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,570
Rym: The guy we were talking about earlier today.

396
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,349
Scott: No, the Greek dude?

397
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:15,882
Rym: He was the one in Greece who was like, "Kids today are stupid.

398
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:16,686
Rym: The parents followed.

399
00:21:16,706 --> 00:21:16,987
Rym: Everything's

400
00:21:17,008 --> 00:21:17,490
Rym: collapsing.".

401
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:20,210
Scott: So the point of reading the book will be shit doesn't change?

402
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,454
Rym: Well, the thing is, he was right.

403
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:24,305
Scott: The Athenian empire collapsed while he was in that time.

404
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:29,142
Scott: Three thousand years of humanity and shit's still the same.

405
00:21:29,182 --> 00:21:30,206
Scott: Society's no different.

406
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,130
Scott: It's just a little fancier.

407
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,250
Rym: You wrote other stuff, too, and you might like one of his plays.

408
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,999
Scott: Oh, he has a play?

409
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:37,127
Scott: We could read some Greek plays.

410
00:21:37,147 --> 00:21:37,550
Scott: That's cool.

411
00:21:38,591 --> 00:21:43,670
Scott: Can we set up a forum and then go act in it and then have funny things happen on our way there?

412
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:52,050
Rym: We did a show in like 2006. that was a funny thing happened on the way to the forum.

413
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:54,850
Scott: But it had nothing to do with the actual play.

414
00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:00,770
Rym: I remember remarking then that I doubted any of our listeners even knew that was a play, let alone what it was about.

415
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:01,512
Scott: You know what?

416
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:02,436
Scott: I know it's a play.

417
00:22:02,637 --> 00:22:04,064
Scott: I sort of know what it's about.

418
00:22:04,526 --> 00:22:05,230
Scott: Haven't seen it.

419
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,999
Rym: Well, we can't do a show on it because we already have a show called that.

420
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:10,710
Rym: But anyway, Scott, are you familiar with Liz Estrada?

421
00:22:11,691 --> 00:22:13,030
Scott: I've heard that name.

422
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,149
Rym: That's what Liz Estrada is about.

423
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:15,731
Scott: Oh, yeah.

424
00:22:15,771 --> 00:22:18,162
Scott: That's what's it called?

425
00:22:18,182 --> 00:22:18,865
Scott: There was actually.

426
00:22:18,885 --> 00:22:20,030
Scott: it was recently on Broadway.

427
00:22:20,592 --> 00:22:22,310
Rym: Liz Estrada Jones, the football team.

428
00:22:24,951 --> 00:22:29,524
Rym: Liz Estrada is pretty funny and full of penis jokes.

429
00:22:30,387 --> 00:22:31,390
Rym: And it was written by the same guy.

430
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:31,873
Scott: Yep.

431
00:22:32,182 --> 00:22:32,306
Scott: OK.

432
00:22:33,812 --> 00:22:35,384
Rym: Oh, maybe I'll pick an old Greek play.

433
00:22:35,424 --> 00:22:36,250
Rym: We'll do like Antigone.

434
00:22:37,236 --> 00:22:37,810
Scott: What's it about?

435
00:22:38,613 --> 00:22:39,220
Rym: You've never really.

436
00:22:40,851 --> 00:22:43,130
Rym: That was like ninth grade literature class.

437
00:22:43,272 --> 00:22:43,726
Scott: Not for me.

438
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,789
Rym: Or Antigone, as I like to say.

439
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,022
Scott: Antigone.

440
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:47,549
Scott: Oh, OK.

441
00:22:48,232 --> 00:22:49,639
Scott: I still don't know what it's about, but I've heard of it.

442
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:51,430
Rym: Hermadea anyway.

443
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:55,567
Scott: Because I was like when you said it the first time, my brain spelled it like A-N-T-I-K-N.

444
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,296
Scott: Come on, Antigone.

445
00:22:57,336 --> 00:22:59,488
Rym: That was with Socrates, Testicles.

446
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,510
Scott: Testicles is the best.

447
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,990
Rym: Testicles and Socrates together wrote Antigone.

448
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,437
Scott: Anyway, other meta things.

449
00:23:08,537 --> 00:23:12,270
Scott: Our website is still upgraded from what it was some weeks ago.

450
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:12,691
Scott: Yes.

451
00:23:12,711 --> 00:23:14,769
Rym: So I have a mission for all of you punk kids out there.

452
00:23:15,371 --> 00:23:21,490
Rym: If you want us to do more video content, because many of you say this, we've got a lot of video content out there.

453
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:28,990
Rym: Spread the existing video content around until that stuff gets a lot more views, because we haven't really linked to it from a lot of places.

454
00:23:29,455 --> 00:23:30,168
Rym: I ain't doing shit.

455
00:23:31,752 --> 00:23:33,442
Scott: So, yeah, you can go to our website.

456
00:23:33,462 --> 00:23:34,809
Scott: We've got video stuff there now.

457
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,416
Scott: The Wiki Show Notes.

458
00:23:36,939 --> 00:23:39,030
Scott: Nobody's really done any Wiki Show Notes.

459
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:45,050
Scott: You have to go to GitHub, slash, you know, you have to go to my GitHub and fork the FRC-ShowNotes project.

460
00:23:46,252 --> 00:23:50,150
Scott: If you want to do that and you can't figure it out, I'll be more than happy to teach you things.

461
00:23:52,952 --> 00:23:54,310
Rym: Yeah, we talked about that.

462
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:57,170
Rym: That's the trouble, if there's a slightly high barrier to entry.

463
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:01,850
Scott: But that's good because I don't want, if I did it to the straight Wiki, it would be full of spam already.

464
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:08,350
Rym: But it would also be worth it to you because Git is very useful to know and you don't need to use Git necessarily for writing code.

465
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:10,310
Scott: No, it's really easy, actually.

466
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:14,910
Rym: In fact, if you're a writer, like all you fanfiction kids with your My Little Pony fanfics or whatever.

467
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:20,830
Scott: If you have any files you work with and you need to be able to undo them or share them, it is worth your while to use GitHub.

468
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:25,390
Rym: Yeah, writing some sort of erotic fanfiction with three friends, GitHub will help you do that.

469
00:24:25,656 --> 00:24:26,169
Scott: Very well.

470
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:31,530
Rym: Yeah, in case someone adds too much cock, you can be like, no, I'm branching off the less cock version.

471
00:24:32,715 --> 00:24:33,343
Rym: I'm forking it.

472
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,360
Rym: Anyway, ConnectiCon, July 13th, 14th, 15th in Hartford, Connecticut.

473
00:24:38,813 --> 00:24:39,870
Rym: We're on the panels department.

474
00:24:40,252 --> 00:24:44,030
Rym: We have a pretty fucking awesome selection of panels for you this year.

475
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,409
Scott: Things are looking up for ConnectiCon.

476
00:24:46,212 --> 00:24:48,610
Rym: Yes, the convention has done a lot of the things we've needed.

477
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:51,466
Rym: The website is not what it used to be.

478
00:24:53,211 --> 00:24:54,340
Rym: That's all else I want to say.

479
00:24:54,461 --> 00:24:55,449
Rym: It's an everything con.

480
00:24:57,473 --> 00:25:01,050
Scott: It doesn't even try to call itself an anime con or a gaming con.

481
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:02,368
Rym: You know what the tagline is this year?

482
00:25:02,992 --> 00:25:05,290
Rym: A massively moultrie genre convention.

483
00:25:05,551 --> 00:25:07,830
Scott: Oh, because they called it everything but the kitchen sink last time.

484
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:08,552
Rym: And you know what?

485
00:25:08,914 --> 00:25:12,350
Rym: Last year we had a panel on mushing, as in dogs and the Arctic.

486
00:25:13,432 --> 00:25:15,249
Rym: We've got some sword fighting lessons.

487
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:19,586
Scott: Legit ones, not punk kids playing with swords.

488
00:25:19,606 --> 00:25:20,470
Scott: they bought in the dealer's room.

489
00:25:20,632 --> 00:25:22,410
Rym: These guys are super legit.

490
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:24,879
Rym: What else can I say?

491
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:25,568
Rym: ConnectiCon's awesome.

492
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,830
Rym: Don't expect to hang out with us though because we'll be...

493
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,450
Scott: We're running shit.

494
00:25:29,954 --> 00:25:30,570
Rym: Yes, we're busy.

495
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:33,080
Scott: This Friday actually, what's this Friday?

496
00:25:33,401 --> 00:25:35,310
Scott: July 1st maybe?

497
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:36,761
Rym: No, June 29th.

498
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:42,230
Scott: So June 29th, this Saturday, I believe, was going to be recess.

499
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,110
Scott: But recess was cancelled.

500
00:25:45,292 --> 00:25:49,610
Scott: So instead there is a free board game night special on a Saturday.

501
00:25:49,712 --> 00:25:50,038
Rym: What?

502
00:25:50,404 --> 00:25:50,710
Scott: I think.

503
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:56,730
Scott: Yeah, Think Coffee starting at 5 o'clock, meaning you can play the extra long games.

504
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:57,577
Rym: Guys, we're going.

505
00:25:58,064 --> 00:25:58,489
Rym: I'll be there.

506
00:25:58,770 --> 00:25:59,268
Scott: I'll be there.

507
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:07,950
Rym: Kids, if you guys... Nerd NYC stuff, if you want to actually hang out with us or play a game with us, that is when to do it.

508
00:26:08,414 --> 00:26:09,189
Rym: We're not busy.

509
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:11,337
Scott: Saturday, 5 o'clock.

510
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,090
Scott: Think Coffee, Mercer Street, New York City.

511
00:26:14,951 --> 00:26:16,263
Scott: I'm pretty sure it's this Saturday.

512
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:16,747
Scott: It might be the...

513
00:26:17,254 --> 00:26:18,250
Rym: Don't be wrong, Scott.

514
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:19,670
Scott: Let me look at my calendar.

515
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:20,615
Rym: Well, Scott looks that up.

516
00:26:20,635 --> 00:26:22,669
Rym: The only other stuff, PEX Prime's coming up.

517
00:26:23,051 --> 00:26:27,570
Rym: We will very likely be there doing very likely a brand new lecture, a new Triple Threat.

518
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,498
Scott: It is Saturday, June 30th,

519
00:26:29,498 --> 00:26:29,598
Scott: 2012. 5

520
00:26:29,598 --> 00:26:29,880
Scott: o'clock.

521
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:35,045
Rym: And we may actually be at PEX Dev.

522
00:26:35,085 --> 00:26:35,990
Rym: We're still working on that.

523
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:38,750
Rym: But we got a good thing going here and we're trying to sort out the details.

524
00:26:40,052 --> 00:26:41,269
Rym: Scott may or may not be there.

525
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:42,570
Scott: May, we'll see.

526
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:45,130
Rym: If Scott is not there, I'm just getting this on the show now.

527
00:26:45,251 --> 00:26:46,779
Rym: It's not because he wasn't invited.

528
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:48,850
Rym: It's because he doesn't want to spend vacation days.

529
00:26:49,111 --> 00:26:49,814
Scott: I don't have enough.

530
00:26:50,056 --> 00:26:53,030
Scott: I'm still fighting basically every day to get more vacation days.

531
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:55,309
Rym: You already got to spend Thursday, Friday for PEX.

532
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:56,790
Scott: I might just quit.

533
00:26:58,155 --> 00:26:59,130
Rym: That would be a bad idea.

534
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,630
Scott: Take some horrible job, whatever I can get when I get back.

535
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:02,927
Rym: Not a bad idea at all.

536
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,224
Scott: We'll see what happens.

537
00:27:05,231 --> 00:27:07,349
Rym: I really just want an excuse to stay in Seattle the whole week.

538
00:27:08,012 --> 00:27:08,629
Scott: Yeah, I wouldn't mind.

539
00:27:10,891 --> 00:27:12,709
Rym: So, we've been playing some games.

540
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:13,864
Scott: We have?

541
00:27:14,312 --> 00:27:17,710
Rym: The one game we haven't been playing is Diablo 3.

542
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:17,925
Scott: No kidding.

543
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,991
Rym: Now Diablo 3...

544
00:27:19,991 --> 00:27:24,090
Scott: I want to say, as much as I rag on this kind of game, which I do often, right?

545
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:24,849
Rym: Scratches niche, doesn't it?

546
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:29,030
Scott: All you do in Diablo and also Torchlight is click on bad guys.

547
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,410
Scott: And when you're about to die, push the healing potion button.

548
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,630
Scott: If there's no healing potions left, you push the town portal button.

549
00:27:34,171 --> 00:27:34,749
Scott: But you know what?

550
00:27:35,311 --> 00:27:36,750
Scott: That's a bullshit, stupid game.

551
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:40,589
Scott: But I bought Diablo 2 when it came out and played the hell out of it.

552
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,990
Rym: Yup, I played the fuck out of Diablo 1.

553
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,910
Scott: Up until freshman year of college.

554
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:49,550
Scott: And Torchlight 1, when that got, you know, I didn't buy it immediately.

555
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:52,589
Scott: But after a few months after coming out, I bought it and I played it and I beat it.

556
00:27:53,072 --> 00:27:55,210
Scott: And I'm probably going to get Torchlight 2 as soon as it comes out.

557
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:58,210
Rym: It's an important distinction because, you know, we often are very critical of games.

558
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:58,759
Rym: And that's true.

559
00:27:58,779 --> 00:27:59,330
Rym: We have very high standards.

560
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,022
Scott: It's like Initial D. I'm like, "This sucks.

561
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:01,727
Scott: Click, click,

562
00:28:01,747 --> 00:28:01,989
Scott: click.".

563
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:05,427
Rym: Like, every time we say like, "Oh, World of Warcraft is bad for these ten

564
00:28:05,488 --> 00:28:05,850
Rym: reasons.".

565
00:28:06,672 --> 00:28:08,730
Rym: I can also give you a bunch of reasons why it's good.

566
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,133
Rym: And you know what?

567
00:28:09,153 --> 00:28:14,250
Rym: Diablo, from all the problems it has, that genre has a place in the gaming world.

568
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,610
Rym: And I have myself enjoyed that genre.

569
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:17,287
Scott: Click, click, click.

570
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,419
Rym: What was Dave Riley?

571
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:20,609
Rym: He was like, "Hey, grots.

572
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:21,840
Rym: Let's play some World of

573
00:28:21,881 --> 00:28:22,387
Rym: Warcraft.".

574
00:28:22,731 --> 00:28:23,649
Rym: And then he starts IMing her.

575
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,930
Rym: One, one, one, one, one, two, one, one.

576
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:28,029
Rym: One, one, one, two, two, one, one, one.

577
00:28:29,253 --> 00:28:29,849
Scott: Yeah, Diablo.

578
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,550
Scott: Left click, left click, left click, left click, left click.

579
00:28:32,954 --> 00:28:33,930
Scott: Right click, left click.

580
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:37,312
Rym: So, we're not reviewing Diablo 3.

581
00:28:37,312 --> 00:28:43,930
Rym: We're using Diablo 3 as an example because this... It's not that this is a necessarily new concept.

582
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:53,190
Rym: It's that these issues are very rapidly coming to the front of the queue of important things that are gonna cause problems in the gaming world.

583
00:28:54,350 --> 00:29:00,710
Rym: And we're gonna talk about this if we do that one panel at PAX on like ethics and gaming and game design and all that.

584
00:29:01,793 --> 00:29:03,769
Rym: But this is something we gotta talk about now.

585
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:05,610
Scott: So, here's what happened, right?

586
00:29:05,691 --> 00:29:14,330
Scott: As I understand it, as someone just reading things on the internet, I could be wrong because I haven't actually played Diablo 3 and some Diablo 3 experts are probably gonna come down on me.

587
00:29:14,571 --> 00:29:16,610
Scott: But this is as I understand it what happened, right?

588
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:21,630
Scott: In Diablo 3, you play the game and you get Diablo gold.

589
00:29:22,712 --> 00:29:29,670
Scott: In the game world, there is an auction house where you can buy things from other players, even though it's a single player game, with the in-game gold.

590
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:35,850
Scott: So, if you play the game a lot and get a lot of gold, you can buy really awesome weapons that other people found that are better for your character.

591
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:46,588
Scott: You can also, if you find items that your character doesn't need, sell them in the auction house to get Diablo gold from other people and the life goes on.

592
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:57,670
Scott: So, you can earn Diablo gold by killing guys and picking it up off the ground, selling things in the auction house, or by paying real fucking money and just buying fucking Diablo gold with real money.

593
00:29:58,251 --> 00:30:03,634
Scott: You can also take your Diablo gold and turn it back into real money, as in U.S.

594
00:30:03,694 --> 00:30:07,450
Scott: dollars, or euros, or whatever the hell it is that you use in your country.

595
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:15,410
Rym: Now, the concept at its core may not necessarily involve any ethical problems.

596
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:16,750
Rym: This seems pretty straightforward.

597
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:22,510
Rym: So, one question that has already come up, let's say I buy Virtual Good.

598
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:29,290
Rym: Now, forget the TOS that users sign, because EULA's in terms of service have not really been thoroughly tested in the courts.

599
00:30:30,511 --> 00:30:43,249
Scott: Well, I don't want to talk about, you know, the legality is, in some areas is vague and some is pretty clear, but it's pretty boring to discuss it, you know, either way because it's like, well, lawyers will just decide and that's what it is.

600
00:30:43,691 --> 00:30:46,606
Rym: But I just want to bring it up because, you know, this isn't just in the

601
00:30:46,727 --> 00:30:47,109
Rym: U.S.,

602
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:49,450
Rym: which totally complicates things.

603
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:49,792
Scott: That's true.

604
00:30:49,813 --> 00:30:52,270
Scott: You're going to have a different legal result in different countries.

605
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:55,830
Rym: But anyway, so already there have been, imagine this scenario.

606
00:30:56,831 --> 00:31:05,810
Rym: I spent real dollars to buy through their ARMA, as everyone calls it, an item that has effects X, Y, and Z in the game.

607
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:13,589
Rym: And let's say the next day the developers, Blizzard, then change the stats of the item I paid real money for.

608
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:14,291
Scott: Right.

609
00:31:14,613 --> 00:31:18,070
Scott: That's basically, and I made a bunch of analogies because that's what I like to do, right?

610
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:25,870
Scott: But my, you know, it's like if I go to this car dealer and I buy a car and he says the car has air conditioning, that's what was advertised, right?

611
00:31:26,211 --> 00:31:28,490
Scott: I buy it and it was advertised as having air conditioning.

612
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,158
Scott: I give him real money, he gives me the car.

613
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,470
Scott: I drive home, it has air conditioning.

614
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:33,950
Scott: The next day, it still has air conditioning.

615
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:37,910
Scott: Day three, the air conditioning not only does not work, it's gone.

616
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,801
Scott: The compressor is not in the car.

617
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:40,970
Scott: The button is gone.

618
00:31:41,471 --> 00:31:44,930
Scott: It's like, look in the instruction manual, it says nothing about air conditioning.

619
00:31:45,291 --> 00:31:46,708
Scott: I'm like, what the hell happened to my air conditioner?

620
00:31:47,091 --> 00:31:49,830
Scott: And they go back and they say, hey, we removed the air conditioning from all those cars.

621
00:31:50,332 --> 00:31:52,300
Scott: It's like, I already bought it.

622
00:31:52,361 --> 00:31:53,887
Scott: That's a scam.

623
00:31:53,907 --> 00:31:54,510
Scott: That's bullshit.

624
00:31:54,730 --> 00:32:05,390
Scott: If you tried to pull that in the real world, no matter what the contract you signed with the car dealer was, I'm pretty sure the court would totally rule in your favor and demand they give you an air conditioner or some money.

625
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:10,670
Scott: Also, regardless of what the legal result would be, that's still morally wrong.

626
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:11,920
Scott: That's basically a scam.

627
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:13,130
Scott: It's stealing, it's wrong.

628
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:18,410
Rym: See, now it's tricky because on one hand, they are just bits in a computer and it is just a game.

629
00:32:19,372 --> 00:32:21,161
Rym: You're paying for access to this game.

630
00:32:21,663 --> 00:32:22,990
Rym: So imagine if it wasn't real money.

631
00:32:23,532 --> 00:32:26,930
Rym: What if you would ground that item out like in World of Warcraft?

632
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:32,730
Rym: Like I leveled up to level 80 on a character and then they change the character and kind of gimp him a little bit.

633
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,950
Scott: It seems like that's not wrong.

634
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:38,670
Rym: Even though I spent time, which is way more valuable than money.

635
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:39,372
Scott: That's true.

636
00:32:40,396 --> 00:32:41,079
Scott: It's very weird.

637
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:44,050
Scott: It's like, why is it wrong when you spent the real money?

638
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:51,970
Scott: And I think the reason it's wrong when someone spends the real money on it is because that enters you into sort of like this contract.

639
00:32:52,531 --> 00:32:54,457
Scott: They told you this would be this.

640
00:32:54,918 --> 00:32:57,385
Scott: You spent on it in a contract.

641
00:32:57,405 --> 00:32:58,890
Scott: You agreed to do this thing.

642
00:33:00,732 --> 00:33:08,050
Scott: When I get a mushroom in Mario Brothers, if it doesn't make me big, there was no real contract there.

643
00:33:08,491 --> 00:33:10,720
Scott: I wasn't paying for something.

644
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,550
Scott: It's like I'm just playing the game.

645
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:16,097
Scott: You didn't have this binding agreement with anyone.

646
00:33:16,137 --> 00:33:17,201
Scott: You didn't get lied to.

647
00:33:17,221 --> 00:33:19,630
Scott: You didn't get falsely advertised to.

648
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:24,170
Scott: So I think that's the thing that the real money causes a problem with.

649
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:27,910
Scott: Is that now you've agreed, they advertised and sold you a product.

650
00:33:29,011 --> 00:33:32,839
Scott: There was a financial purchasing transaction and then suddenly all these...

651
00:33:38,792 --> 00:33:45,310
Rym: But at the same time, it is just a game and you're paying for access to this game with the understanding that they'll change stuff.

652
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:51,970
Rym: I mean, as much as I agree that it's BS, at the same time, I knew this was going to happen.

653
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,110
Rym: Anyone with half a brain knew stuff like this would happen.

654
00:33:55,410 --> 00:34:04,070
Rym: So you could almost say it's like you went to the store to buy that car and you knew like, yeah, they're probably going to take the air conditioning away at some point or take the tires away.

655
00:34:04,271 --> 00:34:07,210
Rym: Like you knew they could just fuck with your car and you bought it anyway.

656
00:34:07,331 --> 00:34:07,511
Scott: Right.

657
00:34:07,532 --> 00:34:10,406
Scott: But what if the car dealer had, you know, it's in the fine print.

658
00:34:10,485 --> 00:34:11,330
Scott: You knew it could happen.

659
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,674
Rym: No, it's not just in the fine print.

660
00:34:12,895 --> 00:34:14,781
Rym: It's us, Scott.

661
00:34:14,962 --> 00:34:17,469
Rym: We were sure this exact thing was going to happen.

662
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:20,690
Scott: So you know the car dealer is going to take the air conditioning and you buy it anyway.

663
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:27,949
Scott: But still, it's like a lot of people, they'll go out and intentionally get themselves in the situations that they know they can go to court with.

664
00:34:28,071 --> 00:34:29,790
Scott: And then we'll go to court on purpose.

665
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,110
Rym: Now, there's other unintended consequences of this.

666
00:34:32,331 --> 00:34:34,505
Rym: This is kind of a high level show here, but I don't want to really get into this.

667
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,810
Rym: We're not trying to talk about Diablo.

668
00:34:37,031 --> 00:34:40,409
Scott: Yeah, we're talking about this this general situation across all gaming.

669
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:49,290
Rym: Accounts in Diablo three, as far as I can tell from many reports from many places on the Internet are getting hacked like crazy.

670
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,150
Scott: Because you can get real fucking money.

671
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:58,230
Rym: So this this is a very I mean, in Diablo two, I hacked to like duplicate items and dick around in the game.

672
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:58,651
Scott: Yeah.

673
00:34:58,671 --> 00:35:12,750
Scott: So now your Blizzard account, which is already pretty important, is now as important as your PayPal account, which is why Blizzard is crazy security and will sell you, you know, authentication devices and all sorts of things, because your account is really important.

674
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:16,430
Scott: It's worth money, you know, could even be worth more than a steam account.

675
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:26,530
Rym: But yeah, but now we've got this situation where there is a direct incentive to hack people's accounts and it appears to be happening pretty easily.

676
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:34,502
Scott: Well, hacking accounts means most people have dumbass passwords and you just log in because there may be some has yet unannounced vulnerability.

677
00:35:34,542 --> 00:35:40,210
Rym: because it's possible because there seems to be like clusters of hacks all at once where a bunch of people suddenly get hacked.

678
00:35:41,914 --> 00:35:43,530
Scott: Anyway, there's also the issue, right?

679
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:54,310
Scott: And this is the argument Blizzard comes up with is, hey, you know, if we didn't do this and make this legit auction house, everyone would just use a Chinese place.

680
00:35:54,411 --> 00:35:56,390
Scott: And it would be, you know, and that doesn't protect the user.

681
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:56,650
Scott: Right.

682
00:35:56,670 --> 00:36:07,510
Scott: Wouldn't you rather spend your money on us where you're guaranteed to know you get what you're getting, except for when you change it, rather than send money to some shady Chinese guy and get nothing?

683
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:12,650
Scott: Or, you know, someone would still hack your account and then sell all your stuff on the gray black market.

684
00:36:12,992 --> 00:36:13,475
Scott: So what's the?

685
00:36:13,576 --> 00:36:15,830
Scott: at least, you know, this is going through the real market.

686
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,089
Scott: You report your account is hacked.

687
00:36:17,431 --> 00:36:21,669
Scott: Now that person, you know, you can get your account back because it's, you know, run by the legit guys.

688
00:36:22,131 --> 00:36:27,650
Rym: But at the same time, so why is this even here in the first place?

689
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:41,630
Rym: This is pretty much, I mean, Diablo one and two for the majority of people that I ever knew was either a single player game or a quote unquote multiplayer game in that me and a couple of friends would just stick around and play together for a few hours.

690
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,270
Scott: This is the core thing, right?

691
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:46,630
Rym: This would be like if I was selling upgrades in Borderlands.

692
00:36:47,152 --> 00:36:47,493
Rym: Right.

693
00:36:47,975 --> 00:36:51,970
Scott: They could solve this whole problem by just really easily.

694
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,549
Scott: You can't trade shit with people.

695
00:36:55,411 --> 00:36:56,270
Scott: It's that simple.

696
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,516
Rym: But no, no, maybe.

697
00:36:57,617 --> 00:36:59,430
Rym: Remember, we did that lecture at PAX on money making games.

698
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,558
Scott: It's a single player game.

699
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:02,309
Scott: I don't need to have Gordon Freeman, you know.

700
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:03,958
Scott: Oh, dude, you're playing Half Life 2?

701
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:05,227
Scott: Yeah, I'm playing Half Life 2.

702
00:37:05,227 --> 00:37:05,690
Scott: Where are you?

703
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:07,878
Scott: Oh, man, I'm in Nova Prospect.

704
00:37:07,938 --> 00:37:09,284
Scott: Oh, you need some extra rebar?

705
00:37:09,345 --> 00:37:10,490
Scott: I'll hook you up for five bucks.

706
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:13,770
Scott: You can't trade your rebar with some other Gordon Freeman.

707
00:37:14,172 --> 00:37:14,637
Scott: That's not how.

708
00:37:14,698 --> 00:37:15,650
Scott: it's a single player game.

709
00:37:15,953 --> 00:37:17,250
Scott: This is a single player game.

710
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:19,370
Rym: This is more a multiplayer game, more like Borderlands.

711
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:29,190
Rym: But yet at the same time, it's a game where if another player is higher level than you or gets some advantage over you, who cares?

712
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,867
Rym: You're not really going to play with them.

713
00:37:33,513 --> 00:37:38,050
Rym: And to make this stuff all work, they added the always on DRM.

714
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:45,370
Scott: The only thing that can really help you by spending money is beat the game on a harder difficulty mode or more quickly.

715
00:37:45,571 --> 00:37:46,375
Scott: That's really all.

716
00:37:46,436 --> 00:37:47,481
Scott: leveling up gets you.

717
00:37:47,943 --> 00:37:49,089
Scott: It doesn't get you anything else.

718
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:53,590
Rym: And if they have PvP with arenas and things or places where you can PvP.

719
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:54,514
Scott: Which they don't have.

720
00:37:54,554 --> 00:37:57,968
Scott: They even said in their own words, "It is not a PvP

721
00:37:58,008 --> 00:37:58,269
Scott: game.".

722
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:05,330
Rym: So, what's the goddamn point other than to make residual income to pay for the server upkeep?

723
00:38:06,372 --> 00:38:06,685
Scott: That.

724
00:38:07,311 --> 00:38:10,310
Rym: I think one of the problems, Blizzard, they know what they're doing.

725
00:38:10,774 --> 00:38:12,044
Rym: We've met a lot of people from Blizzard.

726
00:38:12,064 --> 00:38:12,670
Rym: They know what's up.

727
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:27,810
Rym: But I feel like this is a case of wanting to make game X and wanting to monetize with monetization model Y. And they're sort of conflating multiple game mechanics and monetization models together.

728
00:38:28,792 --> 00:38:32,530
Scott: But it's working and they got their fist full of money, so what can you say?

729
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,648
Rym: Yeah, it's working for now.

730
00:38:34,032 --> 00:38:36,390
Rym: But it's also causing a lot of bad blood.

731
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,870
Scott: All the bad blood is only amongst the hardcore people.

732
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:39,450
Scott: No, it's not.

733
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:44,528
Rym: The harder core a person is, the less likely I believe their statement of, "I'm never playing a Blizzard game

734
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:44,789
Rym: again.".

735
00:38:45,474 --> 00:38:47,570
Rym: Those people are not giving up on Blizzard games.

736
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:49,490
Rym: They're not even giving up on Diablo.

737
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:51,910
Scott: But I mean, they're the ones who are going to complain on the internet.

738
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:55,870
Scott: Normal people won't even realize there's a problem, that their item was changed or who knows what.

739
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:59,168
Rym: But the people who complain are the ones who are the least likely to do anything about it.

740
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:00,088
Rym: Maybe.

741
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:01,310
Rym: Other than complain.

742
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:09,610
Rym: The only reason I'm not playing it is that games like this I would usually play by myself on a laptop on a trip.

743
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:10,648
Rym: But I can't do that.

744
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:12,310
Scott: Yeah, I'm just going to get Torchlight 2.

745
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,768
Scott: Torchlight 2, you pay one price, you get in.

746
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:15,394
Scott: You can play.

747
00:39:15,434 --> 00:39:16,730
Scott: come up, you can play single player.

748
00:39:17,213 --> 00:39:17,910
Scott: They don't give a fuck.

749
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,389
Scott: You can run your own goddamn server.

750
00:39:20,416 --> 00:39:21,110
Scott: They don't give a shit.

751
00:39:21,751 --> 00:39:24,730
Scott: It's just like the way Diablo 2 was, only better.

752
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:26,649
Scott: Because it's more modern.

753
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:31,290
Rym: I just can't understand the mindset of anyone who would buy an item with money in it.

754
00:39:32,432 --> 00:39:36,730
Scott: Yeah, I mean, if you're playing Half-Life 2 and you run out of, say, shotgun shells.

755
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:39,429
Scott: Are you really going to put in a dollar to get more shotgun shells?

756
00:39:40,132 --> 00:39:41,570
Scott: Or are you just going to go in the house?

757
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:45,030
Scott: You know, if you're playing Zelda 1, would you put a dollar in to get another heart container?

758
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:46,088
Scott: Hell no.

759
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:49,530
Rym: If this was like our favorite old Bungie game, Gunbound.

760
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:50,628
Rym: Remember Bungie?

761
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:55,490
Rym: So, in that game, buying better items made you just win.

762
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:58,047
Rym: You know, that was an early American game.

763
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:59,410
Scott: That's pay to win.

764
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:03,290
Rym: It was an American game, but in America, it was one of the early games that people would play commonly.

765
00:40:03,672 --> 00:40:05,870
Rym: Where you could just buy better items with dollars and win.

766
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,010
Scott: Even though it was a Korean game.

767
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:08,450
Rym: Yeah, but you could just buy stuff.

768
00:40:09,232 --> 00:40:12,130
Rym: So, in that situation, yeah, I could understand.

769
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:16,570
Rym: But there's really no, like, multiplayer competitive aspect.

770
00:40:17,293 --> 00:40:18,690
Rym: Other than, you know, like, hardcore mode.

771
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:22,830
Rym: Like, maybe you want to be the badass who beats the game with, you know, whatever.

772
00:40:23,392 --> 00:40:24,469
Rym: In the rankings or stuff.

773
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:29,190
Rym: Hardcore mode, those characters don't have access to the real money auction house.

774
00:40:29,292 --> 00:40:29,810
Scott: Oh, they don't?

775
00:40:30,572 --> 00:40:31,249
Scott: Oh, I didn't know that.

776
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:34,610
Rym: Yeah, they're separately ranked and they cannot buy stuff through that.

777
00:40:35,292 --> 00:40:37,430
Scott: Oh, so that's the mode you want to play.

778
00:40:38,772 --> 00:40:40,430
Rym: Well, your character dies, they're gone forever.

779
00:40:40,574 --> 00:40:40,746
Rym: I know.

780
00:40:40,973 --> 00:40:41,060
Scott: Yeah.

781
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:41,524
Scott: That's good.

782
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:42,388
Scott: That's cool.

783
00:40:43,211 --> 00:40:45,890
Scott: But I thought that the hardcore mode still had the real money auction house.

784
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,309
Rym: No, they do not have access to that.

785
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:50,390
Scott: Oh, then why would you even bother with the real money auction house at all?

786
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:55,210
Scott: I would just play hardcore mode and only hardcore mode until I beat the game that way.

787
00:40:55,732 --> 00:40:58,270
Rym: Or I'll just play the game, dicking around, whatever, level up, whatever.

788
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:03,030
Scott: The other thing I don't understand is why people are obsessed with beating the game on the insane difficulty mode, right?

789
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:04,950
Scott: It's like in Doom 1, it's like nightmare mode.

790
00:41:05,412 --> 00:41:06,569
Scott: That's a joke, guys.

791
00:41:07,573 --> 00:41:09,330
Rym: I tried to beat Doom 2 on nightmare mode.

792
00:41:09,471 --> 00:41:10,989
Rym: I got pretty dicked pretty far.

793
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:12,830
Scott: Yeah, but it's mostly a joke, guys.

794
00:41:12,931 --> 00:41:15,390
Scott: You're not actually supposed to beat that shit, right?

795
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:21,670
Scott: You're supposed to play an ultra violence like a man and not, you know, nightmare mode is just like, ah, let's see if anyone can actually do this.

796
00:41:21,952 --> 00:41:22,461
Scott: No, they can't.

797
00:41:23,432 --> 00:41:24,170
Scott: It's pretty doable.

798
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,030
Scott: But Diablo is the same thing.

799
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:29,290
Scott: It's like, ah, here's the difficulty level, so difficult you can't do anything.

800
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:30,208
Scott: It's like, well, what do I need?

801
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:30,870
Scott: What do I care?

802
00:41:30,951 --> 00:41:31,690
Scott: I already beat the game.

803
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:32,490
Scott: I killed Satan.

804
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:32,903
Scott: What do I?

805
00:41:33,231 --> 00:41:33,545
Scott: That's it.

806
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:34,305
Scott: You mean Diablo.

807
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:34,890
Scott: Right.

808
00:41:34,991 --> 00:41:35,848
Scott: Why would I play again?

809
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:48,050
Rym: That's, I feel like there's so many, like all the things that are messed up with this game, interestingly, really only affect the people that will complain about them.

810
00:41:48,692 --> 00:41:51,629
Rym: And other than the online DRM, it doesn't even affect me.

811
00:41:52,432 --> 00:41:55,150
Rym: I mean, I would never use that auction house for anything.

812
00:41:55,482 --> 00:41:55,648
Scott: Ever.

813
00:41:57,070 --> 00:42:06,990
Scott: Maybe, maybe if I played the game in non hardcore mode, which is not likely if I had the game, uh, I would say I found an item I didn't need, sell it in the real money.

814
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:08,130
Scott: I was like a free money.

815
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:08,391
Scott: There's.

816
00:42:08,411 --> 00:42:12,870
Rym: no, I cannot envision a situation in a game like this where I would ever buy an item with dollars.

817
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:18,149
Scott: Well, the thing is if I, you know, if I was just playing casually and I found, no, in fact, you know what?

818
00:42:18,791 --> 00:42:28,950
Scott: Now that I think about it, I would find items if I might sell them in the real money auction house, but then I'd pretty much never want to buy anything with the in game money because that's real money.

819
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:31,130
Scott: I could just, I would always just cash out the money.

820
00:42:31,638 --> 00:42:32,089
Scott: I would never.

821
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:36,290
Scott: So like I wouldn't even buy healing potions because like I found a hundred gold.

822
00:42:36,513 --> 00:42:37,770
Scott: You could turn that into a penny.

823
00:42:38,335 --> 00:42:39,010
Scott: I'll take the penny.

824
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:39,990
Scott: Fuck the healing potion.

825
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:49,188
Rym: I mean, if you're like, if we're playing dominion and I could like trash a province and you had to give me $5, I would just lose the game and take out your wallet.

826
00:42:50,836 --> 00:42:51,110
Scott: Right?

827
00:42:51,271 --> 00:42:52,307
Scott: It's like, Jesus Christ.

828
00:42:52,892 --> 00:42:57,147
Scott: You know, Matt, you're playing every point you get in Pac-Man, a penny comes out of the machine.

829
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:58,108
Rym: No team forgers too.

830
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:03,027
Rym: I complain about this, but at least, you know, with the Pareto frontier team forgers too is fair.

831
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:03,807
Scott: Somewhat.

832
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:07,110
Rym: It's pretty much fair from all, for most intents and purposes.

833
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:09,630
Rym: I mean, case in point, more fair than Diablo.

834
00:43:10,191 --> 00:43:19,470
Rym: No, but what I'm saying is that in that game, I at least understand why people buy the stuff because it's a competitive game, a directly competitive game.

835
00:43:20,011 --> 00:43:26,710
Rym: That'd be like if a real hockey player could spend a thousand dollars and get to wear a special helmet with a different color or a light on it.

836
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:27,470
Scott: So this is the thing, right?

837
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:28,709
Scott: So people have to understand this.

838
00:43:29,111 --> 00:43:33,370
Scott: If there is a game that is pay to win and you want to win, that's your high priority.

839
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:37,584
Scott: Like, imagine if you could get the actual Stanley cup by winning and you could pay to win.

840
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:45,668
Scott: You're dumb if you don't pay to win, but to even play a game that is pay to win is dumb in the first place.

841
00:43:46,231 --> 00:43:48,569
Scott: So it's sort of like if you're in it, of course you pay to win.

842
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:51,850
Rym: No, but what I'm saying is Team Fortress 2 is not pay to win.

843
00:43:52,071 --> 00:43:52,449
Scott: It sort of is.

844
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:53,129
Rym: No, it isn't.

845
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:53,523
Scott: Sort of.

846
00:43:53,812 --> 00:43:54,369
Rym: No, it isn't.

847
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:58,550
Rym: It's afraid that the normal items are on the same frontier.

848
00:43:58,910 --> 00:43:59,228
Scott: Mostly.

849
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:00,309
Rym: A hundred percent.

850
00:44:00,691 --> 00:44:01,410
Scott: It's not a hundred percent.

851
00:44:02,352 --> 00:44:06,829
Rym: The only difference is that you have more tactical options with the other items and whatever.

852
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:18,049
Rym: But by and large, I mean, if I go play in a Team Fortress 2 server, as many of the listeners found out the last time I had aimed to join a game, I was known as captain motherfucking headshot, don't even come near me or my team.

853
00:44:18,644 --> 00:44:18,850
Scott: Yeah.

854
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,388
Scott: That's just because they're really bad.

855
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:22,930
Scott: If they were also as good as you.

856
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:26,608
Rym: And compared to Counter-Strike, sniping in Team Fortress 2 is like, "Oh, a bunch of heads.

857
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:27,727
Rym: Let me click on them one by

858
00:44:27,767 --> 00:44:27,828
Rym: one.".

859
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:29,750
Scott: They're gigantic heads that move really slowly.

860
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:31,869
Rym: And they're really far away and they can't even shoot me.

861
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:40,250
Rym: But what I'm saying, Scott, is that at least that is a competitive game where I am constantly competing with tons of other people.

862
00:44:40,671 --> 00:44:49,890
Rym: So buying a non-game affecting item that adds some flair to my character or something funny or something that stands out, I could see why someone else would do that.

863
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:55,269
Scott: I would not want to add flair to make myself stand out in a game where I would much rather be hidden so that no one shoots me.

864
00:44:55,590 --> 00:45:04,090
Rym: Ah, but at the same time, like for example, in Counter-Strike, I always play as Arctic Avenger, even in maps where that makes me stand out like a sore thumb.

865
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:07,409
Rym: Because when I kill a motherfucker, I want him to know it was me.

866
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:11,190
Scott: I choose the guy in Counter-Strike who matches the map all the time.

867
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:11,890
Scott: See, no, no, Scott.

868
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:12,650
Scott: Snow map, Arctic Avenger.

869
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:14,870
Rym: If it's a scrim, yeah, that's what I do.

870
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:15,430
Rym: I play to win.

871
00:45:15,531 --> 00:45:17,710
Scott: I always choose the guy who matches the map no matter what.

872
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:22,089
Rym: No, if it's a pub, I'm the guy with the Benelli and the Arctic Avenger just charging in.

873
00:45:22,491 --> 00:45:24,690
Scott: I always choose the guy who matches the map no matter what.

874
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:30,910
Rym: But all I'm saying is that at least that's a real multiplayer versus game where the primary point is multiplayer.

875
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:45,148
Rym: I feel like for the majority of people, the primary point of Diablo III is either single-player or Borderlands-style multiplayer, in which case I cannot envision a world where any of those people would ever buy anything from the Arma and all the other problems we talked about.

876
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:45,598
Rym: Nope.

877
00:45:47,134 --> 00:45:47,346
Scott: Anyway.

878
00:45:48,953 --> 00:45:53,290
Rym: This whole maelstrom is only going to get worse as time goes on.

879
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:56,490
Scott: I mean, we've already seen a bunch of similar problems in Second Life.

880
00:45:56,650 --> 00:46:00,650
Scott: Second Life sort of started this real money to buy virtual goods, right?

881
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:06,149
Rym: Ah, but at least in that case, it was real money to buy virtual goods that required effort and were created by someone else.

882
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:07,330
Scott: Well, sort of, right?

883
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:10,610
Scott: Here's what happened, because you could buy land from the company.

884
00:46:10,991 --> 00:46:15,550
Scott: So this dude bought land from the company, Linden Labs, right?

885
00:46:16,011 --> 00:46:18,610
Scott: He didn't buy something someone else, some other player had made.

886
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:21,290
Scott: He bought land from the company that made the game.

887
00:46:21,872 --> 00:46:24,430
Scott: Then they banned him because he misbehaved or something.

888
00:46:25,757 --> 00:46:26,689
Scott: He tried to sue them.

889
00:46:27,072 --> 00:46:29,130
Scott: They settled and reinstated his account.

890
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:32,150
Scott: It didn't go to court, so we didn't get a ruling on anything.

891
00:46:32,631 --> 00:46:37,289
Scott: But they settled, which means they probably did not think they were going to have good luck in court.

892
00:46:38,291 --> 00:46:42,390
Scott: Or they weren't going to come out on the economic benefit if they had gone to court.

893
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:58,590
Scott: So that is an interesting thing to keep in mind, is that it is very, very possible that virtual goods, if you purchase them, that might be counted as a purchasing contract and you can't fuck people over.

894
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:00,590
Rym: Oh, so we're getting to the legal ramifications of this.

895
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:00,890
Rym: All right.

896
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:01,750
Scott: Well, you already discussed the rest of it.

897
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:02,550
Rym: No, but let's go one further.

898
00:47:02,711 --> 00:47:03,105
Rym: We've got two.

899
00:47:03,552 --> 00:47:04,490
Rym: We talked about this in the forum.

900
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:09,210
Rym: You've got two people who are players of the game that Blizzard made and hosts.

901
00:47:10,172 --> 00:47:13,430
Rym: One of them has an item that they sell to you through the auction house.

902
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:16,390
Rym: Blizzard is the intermediary and they control the center.

903
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:20,770
Rym: What if the one guy's in China and the other guy's in Alabama and there's disputes?

904
00:47:22,991 --> 00:47:27,530
Rym: Nobody can afford the caliber of lawyers necessarily to sort that shit out.

905
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:31,310
Scott: Not only are they the intermediary of the purchase, but they made it.

906
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:40,890
Scott: But they're also completely controlling not just the production and supply and everything, but the actual good itself is just bits in their database.

907
00:47:41,451 --> 00:47:48,929
Scott: So it's like, you know, you pay me to change bits in some other guy's database and he takes a cut of the money.

908
00:47:49,411 --> 00:47:54,467
Scott: It's like, whoa, that is weird, crazy shit that has not really.

909
00:47:54,487 --> 00:47:57,290
Scott: I mean, I can't even think of an analogous situation.

910
00:47:57,370 --> 00:48:02,063
Scott: That's like if I buy there's nothing like it.

911
00:48:02,123 --> 00:48:04,983
Scott: that's ever happened really in as far as I can think.

912
00:48:05,531 --> 00:48:12,390
Rym: What's funny is in the 90s, I remember people talking about what are the legal ramifications of virtual goods and virtual reality.

913
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:14,290
Scott: We've been thinking about this for a long time.

914
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:16,629
Rym: Well, because everyone was thought that was going to be a big deal.

915
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:17,185
Rym: And it is.

916
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:32,884
Rym: Well, no, it wasn't because in the 90s, late 80s, early to mid 90s, virtual reality and muds and mushes and mucks and like shared online spaces where people would assume these identities were like the big thing, like every like.

917
00:48:32,924 --> 00:48:34,969
Rym: that was what a lot of people wanted out of the Internet.

918
00:48:35,631 --> 00:48:43,830
Rym: And then that whole thing kind of disappeared and was replaced by my real identity online and games that weren't just shared spaces.

919
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:45,539
Rym: There was this whole different like.

920
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:47,490
Rym: cyberspace went in a very different direction.

921
00:48:48,112 --> 00:48:51,370
Rym: So people kind of forgot about all the concerns that were raised during that first push.

922
00:48:52,052 --> 00:49:00,089
Rym: And suddenly all that interest in technology is coming back and we didn't even answer the questions back then.

923
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:01,429
Rym: How the hell are we going to answer them now?

924
00:49:01,793 --> 00:49:02,103
Scott: I don't know.

925
00:49:03,078 --> 00:49:03,550
Scott: I don't know either.

926
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:05,150
Scott: It's even interesting to see how it unfolds.

927
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:11,649
Scott: But all I want to say is if you spend money on some bits in a database, it's like a sword or some shit.

928
00:49:12,451 --> 00:49:15,368
Scott: You are really dumb or you have way too much fucking money.

929
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:17,787
Scott: And you just give me really good money.

930
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:24,862
Scott: But if time is more valuable than money and I have too much money, then you should probably be doing something else besides playing Diablo 3 or games like it.

931
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:26,783
Rym: Come on.

932
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:27,689
Rym: That's a value judgment.

933
00:49:28,273 --> 00:49:29,850
Scott: I think there's other things you should be doing.

934
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:32,990
Scott: Anyway, if you have that kind of money, you could be on a tropical island.

935
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:33,848
Rym: I think we're done here.

936
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:42,390
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

937
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:47,510
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

938
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:52,930
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

939
00:49:53,192 --> 00:49:55,850
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

940
00:49:56,110 --> 00:50:00,590
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

941
00:50:00,970 --> 00:50:04,126
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

942
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:08,410
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

943
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:11,530
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
