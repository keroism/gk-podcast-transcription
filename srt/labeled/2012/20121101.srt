00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,800
Rym: It's Thursday, November 1st, 2012.

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,182
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,915 --> 00:00:13,329
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,450
Rym: And this is GeekNights, Hurricane Edition.

5
00:00:19,211 --> 00:00:20,249
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,658
Scott: So there's a big ass hurricane, everybody knows.

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,360
Rym: I heard something about that, but nothing happened here.

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:35,220
Rym: My power never went out, my internet never went out, water was fine.

9
00:00:36,101 --> 00:00:40,320
Rym: I basically just spent the entire hurricane dicking around in the house, drinking wine and watching Netflix movies.

10
00:00:40,802 --> 00:00:44,160
Scott: I mean, we've called it The Hurrication, is the name for it now.

11
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:50,420
Rym: Now I feel a little bad in that pretty much all my coworkers lost power, most of them still don't have power.

12
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,765
Scott: Save this for the actual main bit.

13
00:00:52,785 --> 00:00:55,094
Scott: here, we talk about the hurricane, but I just got this opening bit.

14
00:00:55,114 --> 00:00:56,740
Scott: that's a side shoot from the hurricane.

15
00:00:57,047 --> 00:00:57,238
Scott: Alright.

16
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:03,420
Scott: I decided, being smart, to take a time-lapse video of the hurricane on my window with my GoPro, because I can do that.

17
00:01:03,781 --> 00:01:05,059
Rym: Ah, Scott has a YouTube video.

18
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,120
Scott: That's right, I uploaded it to YouTube, you can watch it, it's not that exciting.

19
00:01:08,607 --> 00:01:09,197
Rym: I point out...

20
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,440
Scott: It's an interesting cloud movement, you can see that it's facing mostly south, not due south.

21
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:18,720
Scott: And you can see the clouds begin going left to right, coming out of the east, to the west.

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:29,260
Scott: And as the video progresses day after day, you can see the cyclonic motion of the hurricane as the clouds begin to come from the south and turning over Manhattan.

23
00:01:29,861 --> 00:01:32,159
Rym: There's however an unattributed source in the video.

24
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:33,450
Scott: Oh, yeah.

25
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,258
Rym: So the audio, Scott faked it, it's a phony video, because...

26
00:01:38,162 --> 00:01:43,020
Scott: You can't time-lapse the audio, we only do one sample of audio every minute.

27
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,680
Rym: So the audio is actually a recording of my balcony with the Marantz.

28
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,679
Scott: Yeah, with some windiness, which sounds pretty good.

29
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:55,320
Rym: That's why you hear a constant clanging, because the building next to me was going apeshit like a wizard was trying to bring it down.

30
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:03,739
Scott: Yeah, so anyway, I made this video, and then I got a message on YouTube that was like, "Hey, we want to use this

31
00:02:03,779 --> 00:02:04,160
Scott: video.".

32
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:08,658
Scott: And it was actually not the usual, like some other guy wants to use the video, it was like MBC.

33
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,138
Scott: And I'm like, "It's a Creative Commons license, just use it,

34
00:02:12,278 --> 00:02:12,459
Scott: right?".

35
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,477
Scott: Like standard response is like, "It's attribution only license, it even says so right on YouTube,

36
00:02:17,778 --> 00:02:17,999
Scott: right?".

37
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:24,140
Scott: The guy actually emailed me back, and he's actually from MBC, I guess they want to use it for something.

38
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:25,878
Scott: I don't know.

39
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:34,840
Scott: And he didn't fully understand what Creative Commons was, but basically his job is to call people and get people to sign.

40
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:36,098
Scott: Wait, if that's a job!

41
00:02:37,503 --> 00:02:41,486
Scott: He had heard of it before, but he wasn't 100% on... Did you?

42
00:02:41,749 --> 00:02:42,598
Rym: Was he schooled?

43
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:48,540
Scott: I tried to school him many times, but actually, in trying to school him, something happens.

44
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,720
Scott: This is why there's an Opie bit.

45
00:02:50,903 --> 00:02:54,140
Scott: He actually called me at work, because I didn't have anything to do at work anyway.

46
00:02:54,986 --> 00:02:55,779
Scott: No one else was there.

47
00:02:56,101 --> 00:02:58,658
Rym: I've been working from home all week, and depending on the situation...

48
00:02:59,181 --> 00:03:04,440
Scott: I'm the only one who went into work today, no one else went in but me in my little development office.

49
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,160
Scott: And it doesn't seem like anyone else is going to come in tomorrow.

50
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,520
Rym: My office doesn't have power, so there's no point.

51
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,940
Scott: There's no reason people can't go into my office.

52
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,180
Rym: Oh, my building's locked, and the building management didn't even send the doorman, there's no way in.

53
00:03:17,701 --> 00:03:23,560
Scott: So this guy calls me, and I'm discussing with him, and he seems like a cool, smart, normal person.

54
00:03:24,383 --> 00:03:25,880
Scott: He knows what's up with things.

55
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:44,880
Scott: But eventually, I figured out the one... There is actually, at least from my layman's poor-ass legal knowledge, one reason that I had to sign this sort of release, and the Creative Commons license was not good enough for the lawyers at NBC.

56
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,760
Scott: Basically, this release, I have it, it really is an agreement to two things.

57
00:03:50,661 --> 00:03:59,380
Scott: The first thing I'm agreeing to is to give NBC a non-exclusive license to use the footage in this program.

58
00:04:00,183 --> 00:04:04,179
Scott: They don't own it, I'm just giving them permission to use it once, without paying me anything.

59
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:09,020
Scott: Pretty much what the Creative Commons license is already giving them, that's sort of redundant.

60
00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:28,860
Scott: The other thing it says is, I am legally saying that yes, this footage I'm giving you a license to use is mine, I made it, I didn't steal it from somewhere, I have the copyright on it, it belongs to me.

61
00:04:29,221 --> 00:04:31,419
Rym: Ah, that is something the Creative Commons doesn't handle, for example.

62
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:45,600
Scott: And I went to the Creative Commons license after this discussion and looked through the document, you know, the legal version, not the, you know, layman's, you know, easy version, looking for anything that said that, and I could find nothing that said that.

63
00:04:45,680 --> 00:05:18,739
Scott: Now, I am not a lawyer, obviously, but I am thinking, well, what if somebody were to take something that did not belong to them, say, for example, my TimeLapse video, if I had put that on YouTube with the regular YouTube license, and then they downloaded it from YouTube and uploaded it to their YouTube account, doubling it, but they chose Creative Commons license, NBC could be fooled, and if NBC had just used that from the other person's account, without, you know, just based on the Creative Commons license, not knowing that that other person did not have the right to put the Creative Commons

64
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:19,060
Rym: license,

65
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:28,436
Scott: I could theoretically sue NBC, and of course, NBC could probably sue that person who put the fuck, because that person's gonna get in trouble, too.

66
00:05:28,821 --> 00:05:30,739
Rym: Yeah, that person committed fraud, basically.

67
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:38,820
Scott: By getting people to sign this release, instead of just agreeing to Creative Commons license and not even checking with anybody, NBC is avoiding that whole situation altogether.

68
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:46,660
Rym: Well, basically, they're just making it more likely that, one, you do actually have the rights, because if you're willing to sign that, either you're an idiot.

69
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,840
Scott: If they get the, all right, if you sign it and you don't, then you're fucked, and not, you know.

70
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:56,440
Rym: Yeah, it gives them, so they could probably sue you and win anyway if you'd uploaded it non-Creative Commons.

71
00:05:56,941 --> 00:05:59,260
Rym: Like, you were just the dick who, you know, stole someone else's video.

72
00:05:59,429 --> 00:05:59,600
Rym: Right.

73
00:05:59,761 --> 00:06:01,179
Rym: But this gives them a little more ammo in court.

74
00:06:01,722 --> 00:06:04,500
Rym: Yeah, there's no way to handle that, really, without the licenses.

75
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:16,180
Scott: Well, I think that they, you know, I was wondering, I don't know, obviously, the question I have now is, most of the reason I use the Creative Commons license on things is because I want people to just remix without bothering them.

76
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:16,737
Rym: You know what I do?

77
00:06:17,201 --> 00:06:22,058
Rym: I remix anyway, and I don't check the license status of fucking anything I use, except the O.C.

78
00:06:22,118 --> 00:06:26,480
Rym: Remix music, because they have a really reasonable, really good policy on that.

79
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,720
Scott: It's not a Creative Commons license, but it is a reasonable license.

80
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,720
Rym: It's actually a really good one.

81
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,740
Rym: It requires a little more attribution than a Creative Commons attribution does.

82
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:41,863
Scott: Well, I think the Creative Commons attribution simply isn't specific enough about what you need to do to meet the attribution requirement, whereas O.C.

83
00:06:41,903 --> 00:06:44,379
Scott: Remix is very specific about what you need to do.

84
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:44,681
Rym: Now, O.C.

85
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:47,640
Rym: Remixes are themselves already a legal gray area because they're remixes.

86
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,396
Scott: Yeah, that's a different story, but anyway, some of them are.

87
00:06:51,617 --> 00:06:52,220
Scott: They're arrangements.

88
00:06:52,762 --> 00:06:56,700
Rym: So, Scott, legally, what's the difference between an arrangement and a remix?

89
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,500
Scott: I don't know.

90
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,329
Rym: No one does.

91
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,040
Rym: That's the problem.

92
00:06:59,360 --> 00:06:59,440
Rym: Yes.

93
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:08,620
Scott: So, I'm just wondering, there's a question I have is, is there something the Creative Commons people could do in version 4.0?

94
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,054
Scott: Because we're currently on the Creative Commons 3.0 license.

95
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:18,380
Scott: In version 4.0, is there something Creative Commons could do such that to save me from being called by NBC?

96
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,271
Rym: I think there is something they could do.

97
00:07:20,292 --> 00:07:21,300
Rym: There are a couple things they could do.

98
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:28,900
Scott: And I think that that would be a thing that would be worth it for the Creative Commons lawyers to put their time into, figuring out what paragraph they could add to the license.

99
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,599
Rym: I don't want to dwell on it, but I can think of several things they could do.

100
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:38,680
Rym: The problem is every one of them makes it more likely to work and increases their burden of bullshit to deal with.

101
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:48,280
Rym: Like, the highest level would be if they had a registry where you could have a passive version of the license where you just declare you're using it and an active one where you register your use of the license with them.

102
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,960
Scott: Well, you can already register your use of the license with them.

103
00:07:51,181 --> 00:07:54,480
Scott: But it's not any sort of official thing, it's just a searchable directory.

104
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:02,180
Rym: No, I'm talking registers and you sign a contract and fax it with real identification and contact info and all that.

105
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:07,000
Scott: I mean, all NBC wants is for me to print a piece of paper, sign it with a pen, and take a picture of it with my camera.

106
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:14,720
Scott: And then instead of them having to download the crappy version from YouTube, they want me to upload the video to their file server thingy.

107
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:22,080
Scott: They actually have an app set up that's just theirs for people to send them files, which is a good thing to have.

108
00:08:22,381 --> 00:08:25,400
Rym: I have a pretty good video of biking all around downtown, but I didn't do anything with it.

109
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,519
Scott: I have about 100 videos of biking all around the city.

110
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,360
Rym: Well, downtown yesterday.

111
00:08:30,063 --> 00:08:30,951
Scott: Oh, okay.

112
00:08:30,972 --> 00:08:31,840
Scott: Well, that's a little bit different.

113
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:38,260
Scott: So, yeah, that's just something I wanted to talk about because it's related to hurricane, but also Creative Commons.

114
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:38,938
Rym: That was interesting.

115
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,332
Scott: Yeah.

116
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,659
Rym: So, you might have heard that there's a presidential election going on in the United States.

117
00:08:44,385 --> 00:08:45,099
Rym: It's almost over.

118
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,980
Rym: You saw that video of the girl who's crying.

119
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,720
Rym: She wants Obama.

120
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,019
Scott: I was about to reference that video.

121
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,858
Rym: She's like, I just want him to stop.

122
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,363
Rym: I don't.

123
00:08:53,342 --> 00:08:54,560
Scott: So, little girl, high five.

124
00:08:54,765 --> 00:08:55,219
Scott: I'm with you.

125
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:56,239
Rym: Only a few more days.

126
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,553
Rym: Five thirty eight.

127
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:01,100
Rym: It's a New York Times blog and I don't know if anyone knows about this.

128
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,359
Scott: Why is it called Five Thirty Eight?

129
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,879
Scott: Because of Five Thirty Eight electoral votes?

130
00:09:04,341 --> 00:09:07,219
Rym: I'm glad you figured that out because I was about to make a whole bunch of fun of you.

131
00:09:07,985 --> 00:09:08,239
Rym: Yes.

132
00:09:09,141 --> 00:09:11,650
Rym: So, the Electoral College in the U.S.

133
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:14,120
Rym: is a ridiculous joke and we know that.

134
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,200
Rym: We should really fix this, but that's not what I'm talking about.

135
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:23,440
Rym: The Five Thirty Eight blog is pretty notable in that it's pretty much the most respected prognosticator of elections.

136
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:26,900
Scott: Well, isn't that the guy Nate Silver?

137
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,820
Scott: Yes, it's Nate Silver.

138
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,039
Scott: I saw him on the Daily Show.

139
00:09:29,321 --> 00:09:30,580
Scott: That was a really good interview.

140
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:32,519
Scott: Scott Johnson is a big fan of this guy.

141
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:38,060
Rym: I like how in that interview he was very honest about the reliability of polls and very open about his methodology.

142
00:09:38,605 --> 00:09:40,179
Rym: And also very open about his own views.

143
00:09:41,141 --> 00:09:47,080
Rym: I like interviews where people, I hate it when someone is super political and non-committal in an interview.

144
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,715
Rym: I want people to just be like, "No, I fucking hate that

145
00:09:48,735 --> 00:09:48,897
Rym: guy."

146
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:50,738
Rym: Or, "No, I think that's a load of

147
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:50,860
Rym: crap.".

148
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,079
Rym: You know, whatever they think, I want to know.

149
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:59,132
Rym: So, I seem to trust this guy and he currently, as of Dateline 6.24pm, November 1st, 2012, gives Obama a 79% chance of winning the election.

150
00:10:03,288 --> 00:10:03,539
Scott: Okay.

151
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,539
Rym: Which is pretty good.

152
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,980
Scott: I mean, you know, no math on this is obviously going to be perfect, right?

153
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:16,300
Scott: But this guy, according to everything that I can tell, is the best at doing this kind of math.

154
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,117
Rym: He also pretty much says straight up, "Ohio is all that

155
00:10:19,157 --> 00:10:19,560
Rym: matters.".

156
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:26,840
Rym: Literally, our election system is so fucked that Ohio is the only thing that has any chance of affecting the election.

157
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,740
Rym: In fact, Ohio has a more than 50% chance of being the mathematical tipping point of the election.

158
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:37,996
Rym: And the next highest state that has even a chance is Virginia, with like an 11% chance.

159
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,619
Scott: Okay, that's not a big chance at all.

160
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,800
Scott: Yeah, so Ohio- How much would you bet on an 11% chance with monies?

161
00:10:44,865 --> 00:10:45,418
Scott: Zero monies.

162
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:45,800
Rym: No.

163
00:10:46,102 --> 00:10:48,455
Rym: That's why I'm okay, though, because 79% chance of Obama winning.

164
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,973
Rym: I play roulette with, what, a 48% chance?

165
00:10:54,461 --> 00:10:58,199
Scott: If I had that chance of winning the lottery, I would pay the monies.

166
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:03,340
Rym: So, I just want to talk a little bit about my, you know, it's the lounge, it's Thursday, I can talk about whatever I want.

167
00:11:03,903 --> 00:11:07,500
Rym: I can bring something, I can bring anything up, and all Scott can do is complain about it.

168
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,199
Scott: He can't stop me.

169
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:08,880
Rym: He can't complain a lot.

170
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:14,880
Rym: So, one, I think if you vote for Mitt Romney, you're either really ill-informed or pretty dim.

171
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,846
Rym: I'm straight up, I believe that.

172
00:11:17,227 --> 00:11:20,680
Rym: He's such a fake candidate, it's ridiculous.

173
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:30,120
Scott: There are people, right, who are not dim, nor are they ill-informed, yet they- Oh, wait, there's a third possibility, evil.

174
00:11:32,402 --> 00:11:36,979
Rym: The rich people who want to not pay taxes are also voting for him.

175
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:44,560
Rym: But it's amazing that, you know, I'm very cynical about politics, but I'm like an order of magnitude less cynical than Scott.

176
00:11:45,181 --> 00:12:03,000
Rym: But I cannot get over the fact that Mitt Romney basically became the ultra right-wing tea party fanatic to win the primary, and then, as soon as the debate started, basically did a complete 180 and tried to pull this super moderate middle ground.

177
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,060
Scott: Oh my god, politics, that's how it goes.

178
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,320
Rym: But how can you do it so openly?

179
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,044
Scott: Play to win.

180
00:12:08,064 --> 00:12:09,620
Scott: the game doesn't seem to be hurting, does it?

181
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:22,019
Rym: In the movies, and in all the history up to this point, you had to at least be a little bit shady, and use a little bit of finesse, and like wrangle it, but no, he was just like outright, "Yeah, guess what, I'm pretending to be a moderate

182
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:22,300
Rym: now.".

183
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:22,945
Rym: And everyone's like,

184
00:12:23,065 --> 00:12:23,186
Rym: "Yay!".

185
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:28,199
Rym: I can't even, I can't fathom, I can't deal with it.

186
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,380
Rym: So I hear by, Gig Knights is officially endorsing Barack Obama for the President of the United States.

187
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:33,802
Rym: No, I'm not.

188
00:12:34,445 --> 00:12:37,200
Scott: I'm endorsing armed revolution, but you're not allowed to shoot.

189
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:47,100
Scott: You just have to threaten, because hurting people is wrong, but if we hold guns with no bullets in them, we might scare the government into just folding, and we can set up a new nerd government.

190
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,619
Scott: So, that is what I endorse.

191
00:12:49,303 --> 00:12:53,439
Rym: I specifically want to un-endorse all third parties, because seriously...

192
00:12:54,801 --> 00:12:57,919
Scott: Some third parties have the promise, but the problem is...

193
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,860
Rym: Name one in the United States.

194
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,804
Scott: I'm not done saying what I was saying.

195
00:13:01,884 --> 00:13:10,080
Scott: Some third parties have promise, yet every third party has complete craziness in some area that invalidates all its goodness.

196
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,539
Rym: So Scott, third parties are possibly a good idea in the same way that communism is.

197
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,479
Rym: We just haven't implemented it correctly.

198
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,460
Scott: That's exactly right.

199
00:13:17,662 --> 00:13:19,779
Rym: You know what these also have a good thing in common with?

200
00:13:20,682 --> 00:13:21,100
Rym: X-Windows.

201
00:13:22,765 --> 00:13:23,340
Scott: I like X-Windows.

202
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,365
Rym: I don't like X-Windows.

203
00:13:24,385 --> 00:13:26,799
Rym: I don't think there's ever been a good implementation of it.

204
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,919
Rym: There have been functional ones, but no good ones.

205
00:13:30,241 --> 00:13:32,580
Rym: Anyway, I officially endorse Barack Obama.

206
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:38,893
Rym: I think he's going to win the election, and the reason it's important... I didn't care in 2000.

207
00:13:38,893 --> 00:13:39,660
Rym: I really didn't care.

208
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,240
Rym: It was two sides of the same coin, for all intents and purposes.

209
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:48,680
Rym: 2004... Well, Kerry did win, but I digress.

210
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,760
Rym: 2004 Gore won, but I digress.

211
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:58,440
Rym: The problems I have with politics today are really around the fact that our election system in the US is statistically meaningless.

212
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,560
Rym: Because the elections are so close, and our voting machines are so shitty.

213
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,380
Rym: What's amazing is that the reason they're shitty is because they let the states do it themselves.

214
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,940
Rym: But yet, it's a political position to try to naturalize it.

215
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,360
Scott: Well, the states could do it, not shitty, but they don't want to.

216
00:14:11,561 --> 00:14:14,200
Rym: Because they have a vested political interest in doing it shittily.

217
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,929
Rym: I don't know what to do about that.

218
00:14:17,593 --> 00:14:18,500
Rym: How do we fix that?

219
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,048
Rym: The 2000 election was a statistical tie.

220
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,680
Rym: The 2004 election was arguably also a statistical tie.

221
00:14:26,421 --> 00:14:32,020
Rym: And even now, if it's not a tie, the election is determined by, I think, 11 or 12 districts in Ohio and Wisconsin.

222
00:14:32,981 --> 00:14:37,580
Rym: What do we do about that if the only way to fix it is to play the game itself?

223
00:14:38,342 --> 00:14:44,018
Scott: What do we do if those districts in Ohio and Wisconsin eventually get locked in, right?

224
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,860
Scott: Just as locked in as, say, New York is, and then there's no point in even campaigning.

225
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:54,357
Scott: Because they already know who's going to win every time.

226
00:14:54,417 --> 00:14:55,160
Scott: It never changes.

227
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:01,140
Scott: People don't change their minds, and the only way that anything will change will be as old people die.

228
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:03,800
Scott: Which is the only way anything changes anyway.

229
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:14,159
Rym: That's why, despite all your cynicism and my long history of cynicism, despite the fact that I pay a lot more attention to politics than you, in fact, in RIT, I took a seminar class on political communication.

230
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,899
Scott: I only pay attention to Google News, and that's it.

231
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,321
Rym: So that was during the Democratic primary for 2004.

232
00:15:19,321 --> 00:15:20,588
Rym: And the class was a seminar.

233
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,160
Rym: There were only 11 students in the class, so it was like a roundtable.

234
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,490
Rym: So we all took turns teaching the class.

235
00:15:25,531 --> 00:15:27,140
Rym: It was super intense and super great.

236
00:15:28,121 --> 00:15:34,160
Rym: The reason this election is important is not because of who will be president in a direct sense.

237
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,187
Rym: Because you and I know better.

238
00:15:35,207 --> 00:15:38,868
Rym: It's not like the president says, "The economy will hereby be

239
00:15:38,928 --> 00:15:39,371
Rym: good!"

240
00:15:39,391 --> 00:15:40,838
Rym: Or, "The economy will be

241
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:41,180
Rym: bad!".

242
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:46,499
Scott: Yeah, I mean, people act like, you know, the crazy people act like if Obama wins, it's the end of the world, right?

243
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,200
Scott: But it's like, dude, if that was the case, he's been president for four years, has it been the end of the world?

244
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,348
Scott: People act like if Obama loses, it's the end of the world.

245
00:15:52,489 --> 00:15:54,899
Scott: Bush was president for eight years, it wasn't the end of the world, right?

246
00:15:55,301 --> 00:15:58,480
Rym: However, we had a distinctly constant downward trend for eight years.

247
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,240
Scott: I'm not saying it's, you know, but it's still, it's not the end of the world.

248
00:16:01,481 --> 00:16:04,617
Scott: You'll live, you'll see another president depending how old you are, right?

249
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,926
Scott: Your life will not be ruined.

250
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:09,960
Scott: Your day-to-day life will be mostly the same.

251
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,622
Rym: No, no, that's not my point.

252
00:16:10,642 --> 00:16:17,220
Rym: My point is that the presidency, most people vote based almost entirely on the economy or bullshit social red herring issues.

253
00:16:17,842 --> 00:16:21,758
Rym: But the fact is that the president has basically zero influence on the economy.

254
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:22,100
Scott: At all.

255
00:16:22,362 --> 00:16:24,180
Scott: He has zero influence on a lot of things.

256
00:16:24,301 --> 00:16:26,280
Rym: No, he has a huge influence on foreign policy.

257
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,024
Rym: That's true.

258
00:16:27,144 --> 00:16:29,599
Scott: I didn't say that there are nothing that he has influence on.

259
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,120
Rym: On the execution of domestic policies and all sorts of stuff.

260
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,220
Scott: But nothing else besides those things.

261
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:34,821
Rym: It's simpler.

262
00:16:35,383 --> 00:16:41,220
Rym: He has a lot of power over things that are very important, but those are not the things that anyone votes based on.

263
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:48,080
Rym: So people are voting based on the things the president has the least control over and yet think that the president has the most control over.

264
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,720
Rym: It's ridiculous.

265
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,080
Scott: It's like the president can't suddenly make just abortion illegal.

266
00:16:52,903 --> 00:16:58,240
Rym: So it's not important for Obama to win for any procedural stuff of the presidency.

267
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:04,700
Rym: And while Mitt Romney is either evil or a robot, it doesn't matter because he can't do that much damage.

268
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,280
Rym: Because it took two to tango and a lot of Democrats voted for that war with Iran.

269
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:14,099
Scott: Remember, that is the number one feature of our government system that we have in the United States.

270
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:19,220
Rym: It takes two to tango and the Supreme Court has been a ball-less sack of nothing for our entire lives?

271
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:29,920
Scott: Is that while it makes it very difficult to change things to be more awesome very quickly, it makes it equally difficult to change things to be really shitty really quickly.

272
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:30,511
Rym: However...

273
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,860
Scott: Change is slow and difficult in both directions.

274
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:42,720
Rym: However, I would argue that the Republicans under Bush in the last four years of his campaign... Actually, I should say the last eight years of his presidency because that's just funny.

275
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:45,720
Rym: But I think they did a lot of damage, actually.

276
00:17:47,141 --> 00:17:52,580
Rym: And while it wasn't as bad as it could have been because our system is really good at mitigating damage, I think it was a lot of damage.

277
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:53,619
Scott: I didn't say it wasn't.

278
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:59,205
Rym: I think invading Iraq was a disaster and I think had we not done that, we would have been in a much... Things would have been a lot better.

279
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:02,160
Rym: We would have been much more equipped to handle the economic meltdown.

280
00:18:03,362 --> 00:18:03,897
Rym: But that's not...

281
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:04,820
Scott: If it would have even happened at all.

282
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,640
Rym: That's not why I'm saying we should vote for Barack Obama.

283
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:07,616
Rym: Here's why.

284
00:18:08,642 --> 00:18:16,880
Rym: If Mitt Romney wins, this newly energized right-wing movement in the government becomes super energized.

285
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:26,880
Rym: They see that they were right in doubling down on crazy and the party... Basically, the Republican Party has to move in that direction because the crazy people now will win every primary.

286
00:18:28,402 --> 00:18:31,139
Scott: So now we'll have a party... Still playing the game.

287
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:36,500
Rym: So now we'll have a party that is increasingly right-wing by policy because it has no choice.

288
00:18:36,801 --> 00:18:43,260
Rym: If it deviates anyone in the Republican Party who deviates from the right-wing, if Mitt Romney wins, is ostracized.

289
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:50,280
Rym: And now you have a legitimate party that's becoming crazy like a third party that also controls three fucking parts of our four-part government.

290
00:18:51,180 --> 00:19:11,500
Scott: Hopefully what can happen, if he loses, is those Republicans who realize that going super right-wing crazy isn't going to win you anything unless you live in a state where it's crazy, will form the legitimate Republican Party, much like the previous Republican Party, pre-crazy.

291
00:19:12,941 --> 00:19:18,900
Scott: And the crazies will then be just a crazy party, just like the Constitution Party, which is their party, really.

292
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,725
Rym: So, it's better than that.

293
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:24,520
Rym: If Barack Obama wins, there's going to be a schism in the Republican Party.

294
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,729
Rym: I predict this straight up.

295
00:19:26,294 --> 00:19:27,819
Scott: What'll happen... Already schism slightly.

296
00:19:28,241 --> 00:19:37,240
Rym: So what'll happen is that schism will be open because a good part of the party... Remember, Rick Santorum and Michelle Bachmann almost won the nomination.

297
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,184
Rym: They were leading for a time.

298
00:19:39,685 --> 00:19:41,148
Rym: But moderation won out.

299
00:19:41,368 --> 00:19:47,300
Rym: The establishment was still able to kind of push the idea of, "Look, if we put up, the super-crazy will lose.

300
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:50,413
Rym: We gotta put up a token moderate.

301
00:19:50,513 --> 00:19:51,458
Rym: It's the only chance we

302
00:19:51,478 --> 00:19:51,699
Rym: have.".

303
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:59,480
Rym: The crazy wing of the party is going to argue that they lost against Obama because they weren't conservative enough.

304
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,658
Scott: And they're going to put up the super-crazy in four years from now.

305
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:08,360
Rym: Yeah, if Obama wins, Rick Santorum is going to be the furthest-left candidate in the Republican Party.

306
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,846
Scott: And you know what the thing is, right?

307
00:20:10,107 --> 00:20:12,838
Scott: You might think, "Oh no, four years from now, what if the super-crazy

308
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:13,240
Scott: wins?".

309
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:20,980
Scott: Well, I have absolutely no fear of the super-crazy winning, and I'm going to tell you why I have no fear of the super-crazy winning.

310
00:20:21,467 --> 00:20:22,034
Rym: I'm going to guess.

311
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:23,541
Scott: Okay, wait.

312
00:20:24,163 --> 00:20:30,780
Scott: Right now, today, if you think the super-crazy was in the election today, what percent of the vote do you think they would get by the polls?

313
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,880
Scott: I mean, it would be close, maybe?

314
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,453
Rym: I think they would be like 30 or 40 percent, but it wouldn't be like the 48 to 52 percent.

315
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:46,700
Scott: Four years down the line, think about how many more old people will have died, and think about how many more young internet people will have turned 18.

316
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:46,765
Rym: Now!

317
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,060
Scott: The super-crazy will have no chance.

318
00:20:50,304 --> 00:20:51,077
Scott: Two reasons why.

319
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,060
Scott: Not even a chance.

320
00:20:53,282 --> 00:20:54,480
Rym: There's two reasons, not just one.

321
00:20:54,501 --> 00:20:55,099
Rym: Not even close.

322
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:00,400
Rym: Conservatism kind of disappears as people die, because people just kind of get conservative as they're old.

323
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:11,000
Rym: Not because they're getting more conservative, but just because people, when they hit like 20 or 30, just seem to stop moving forward, so the world increasingly... But, there's another factor.

324
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:19,960
Rym: A good percentage of young people today are also crazy, but they're stupid and crazy in the Ron Paul, Rand Paul, Jill Stein direction.

325
00:21:20,825 --> 00:21:21,879
Rym: But they'll balance out.

326
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,060
Scott: There are crazy young people, right?

327
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:30,456
Scott: But, anecdotally speaking, if I look around at the people my age and younger and a little older, the crazy percentage...

328
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,999
Rym: Scott, there's like three people in our forum arguing to vote for Jill Stein in this election, and one guy...

329
00:21:36,563 --> 00:21:37,819
Scott: Out of hundreds, right?

330
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:40,280
Scott: Oh yeah, no, I see where you're going.

331
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:49,340
Scott: You look around, you go to a high school, you go to a college, how many young Republicans are there at the college of a few thousand people?

332
00:21:49,462 --> 00:21:50,940
Scott: Maybe like 20 people, right?

333
00:21:51,560 --> 00:22:02,860
Scott: The percentage of young people, especially the internet generation, are mostly left-wing or indifferent, don't even care about voting at all people.

334
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:08,840
Rym: At worst, they are super liberal on social stuff and don't understand or care about any other issue.

335
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,582
Scott: Exactly.

336
00:22:09,682 --> 00:22:15,780
Scott: So, as time goes on, I do not see, you know, this younger generation of people.

337
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:23,660
Scott: I see the whole country, nay, world, you know, the past pattern has been sort of like a little left-right swingy swingy.

338
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:33,460
Scott: I see a big left movement in the all-internet parts of the world over time, because that's how internet people go.

339
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:34,524
Rym: So...

340
00:22:35,161 --> 00:22:38,279
Scott: And the non-internet people, every year, there are less of them.

341
00:22:38,801 --> 00:22:46,460
Rym: So, the choice is, basically, if Romney wins, in the end, progressivism still wins, because the world keeps moving forward.

342
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,400
Rym: I think there's a famous song about if you can't keep up, get out of the way.

343
00:22:49,461 --> 00:22:50,599
Scott: Can we talk about the hurricane now?

344
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:56,360
Rym: Okay, so, if Romney wins, it's going to take another generation for this bullshit to die out.

345
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:03,880
Rym: If Obama wins, the far right is basically going to explode, and it's going to be one of the greatest things to behold.

346
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,180
Scott: See, but they can still win, like, all these, you know, seats in the House and Senate...

347
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,206
Rym: Oh, they can, they can, but... But...

348
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,630
Scott: Is this crazy states?

349
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:11,700
Scott: The whole state's crazy.

350
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:22,480
Rym: Oh, yeah, but that one, there's enough states now, already, to basically guarantee Democrats win if one or two more states flip blue.

351
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:29,239
Rym: And the thing is, states that were staunchly red are starting to flip blue because young people are moving...

352
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:29,733
Scott: Exactly.

353
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,480
Rym: ...all the states that are getting undue votes in the Electoral College because their populations are growing.

354
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,917
Rym: I mean, New York State is shrinking, and New York City is growing.

355
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:54,760
Scott: This is also anecdotal, but you go on the internet all the time, and you talk to cool people from all around the world, and I see cool people on the internet from places like Alabama... ...or, well, yes, but, you know, I'm talking about crazy states and cool internet people in them, too.

356
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:06,000
Rym: Nevada and Arizona are growing rapidly in population and getting more influence, but most of that growth is in the cities, and there's lots of evidence that if you live in a city, you become more liberal over time.

357
00:24:06,505 --> 00:24:06,976
Rym: Straight up.

358
00:24:07,783 --> 00:24:08,020
Scott: That's true.

359
00:24:08,342 --> 00:24:10,180
Rym: And you're attracted to states if you're already liberal.

360
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,799
Rym: So, yeah, New Yorkers are leaving New York.

361
00:24:12,161 --> 00:24:14,140
Rym: They're going to Arizona, and they're turning the state blue.

362
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,639
Rym: Meanwhile, New York's never gonna turn red.

363
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:16,799
Scott: That's true.

364
00:24:17,002 --> 00:24:18,258
Scott: The old people, right?

365
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:24,100
Scott: You know, because the old, old people die, but there's still new, old people who just became old people.

366
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:42,140
Scott: They retire, and they're gonna move to a different state and not hang around the place where they happen to work, and they're gonna go somewhere, and they're gonna vote, and they usually like to go places that are in the South that are warm, where they need more votes, but those new, old people aren't as conservative as the old people who just went away.

367
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,740
Scott: They're our parents, not our grandparents.

368
00:24:44,161 --> 00:24:44,580
Rym: So, young people...

369
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,016
Scott: Watch out.

370
00:24:45,602 --> 00:24:50,317
Rym: While Barack Obama doesn't agree with me on 99% of what I care about, you know, anything related to technology

371
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:51,340
Scott: or science,

372
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,886
Rym: it doesn't matter because

373
00:24:54,207 --> 00:24:55,030
Scott: a vote

374
00:24:55,070 --> 00:25:09,459
Rym: for Obama is a vote for literally destroying the Republican Party and ushering in possibly an era of Congress starting to make the barest, tiniest, little millimeter step toward maybe debating one issue once.

375
00:25:10,441 --> 00:25:11,997
Rym: And that's the best we can hope for.

376
00:25:18,036 --> 00:25:18,830
Scott: You're so optimistic.

377
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:20,425
Scott: So, things of the day.

378
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:30,390
Scott: So, Ram always likes to talk about the fact that people who saw man land on the moon, their grandparents fought in the Civil War.

379
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,099
Rym: Might have been parents.

380
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,830
Rym: I have to look it up again.

381
00:25:31,931 --> 00:25:33,249
Scott: That's your favorite thing to say.

382
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,570
Rym: It's just, it's such a great little factoid.

383
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:39,243
Scott: So, nothing, you know, you think that's pretty crazy, right?

384
00:25:39,284 --> 00:25:40,810
Scott: Like, wow, time fucking flies.

385
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,330
Scott: Well, time really only fucking flies in the past few centuries.

386
00:25:43,731 --> 00:25:52,197
Scott: You know, people who, you know, in the BC times, it's like, well, yeah, their grandparents were pretty much the same as them with maybe a little bit of difference.

387
00:25:52,418 --> 00:25:54,630
Scott: Technology didn't really progress that rapidly.

388
00:25:55,550 --> 00:26:09,270
Scott: Super historical events that we know about that were really important, that were so important that we know about them today weren't that frequent that like, oh my God, my grandpa saw Alexander the Great and I saw still pretty much the same kind of thing.

389
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:10,550
Scott: Only Alexander the Great's not here anymore.

390
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:23,930
Rym: One thing, entire, like, multi-generational families appeared, had many generations and completely died out in a span of the Roman Empire being relatively unchanged from an urban perspective.

391
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:24,552
Scott: Exactly.

392
00:26:24,612 --> 00:26:28,970
Scott: So really, this is a recent development in our history and nothing illustrates that more than this video.

393
00:26:29,452 --> 00:26:32,570
Scott: This is a video from 1956.

394
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:35,010
Rym: Which is already a long goddamn time ago.

395
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,158
Scott: That is over 50 years ago.

396
00:26:37,993 --> 00:26:40,585
Scott: My parents were alive and perhaps very young.

397
00:26:40,605 --> 00:26:41,770
Scott: I think they were both alive.

398
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,550
Scott: At least one of them was alive at the making of this video.

399
00:26:44,951 --> 00:26:46,328
Rym: World War II had recently ended.

400
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:47,629
Scott: Although they would not remember it.

401
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:54,810
Scott: My grandparents, right, two of them are still living, were both alive and able to watch television.

402
00:26:55,051 --> 00:27:01,270
Scott: When this was on television in 1956, they were already like our age, maybe, or even a little older, younger-ish, right?

403
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,389
Scott: And in this video is a game show.

404
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:10,490
Scott: And in the game show, there is like a celebrity panel, like a semi-celebrity panel, and they bring a special guest onto the panel.

405
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:16,370
Scott: They ask them questions, and they must guess what is significant about the special guest.

406
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,449
Scott: And in this video, I'm just gonna tell you the whole thing.

407
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:24,111
Scott: The special guest is a very old man, but he is alive in the year 1956.

408
00:27:24,111 --> 00:27:28,430
Scott: And this old man witnessed at a young age with his own eyeballs.

409
00:27:28,831 --> 00:27:34,230
Scott: And he was old enough to remember it, at least somewhat, not that old, I think he was like six, five or six at the time.

410
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:45,150
Scott: He saw, he was in Ford's Theater and saw Lincoln get assassinated, and he was alive and on television in 1956.

411
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:48,270
Rym: And then over fifty years later, we watched that on the internet.

412
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:49,874
Scott: Holy shit.

413
00:27:51,242 --> 00:27:52,410
Scott: Take that Alexander the Great.

414
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:57,988
Rym: I love the part where he's like, "All I could think was that poor man, he fell from the balcony when John Wilkes Booth jumped out of the

415
00:27:58,028 --> 00:27:58,449
Rym: stage.".

416
00:27:58,650 --> 00:27:58,871
Scott: Right.

417
00:27:59,273 --> 00:28:00,760
Scott: I wonder if he heard him say "Six Semper

418
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,283
Scott: Tyrannus.".

419
00:28:03,332 --> 00:28:06,082
Scott: But yes, this man now, though, has passed.

420
00:28:06,122 --> 00:28:08,130
Scott: There are no living witnesses to that event.

421
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,670
Scott: But, it's not that far away.

422
00:28:11,611 --> 00:28:15,350
Rym: So, many of you know that Emily and I have two adorable little rabbits.

423
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,989
Rym: We rescued them from a bucket that somewhat abandoned them.

424
00:28:18,432 --> 00:28:18,935
Rym: They're very cute.

425
00:28:19,257 --> 00:28:21,530
Rym: Scott takes care of them sometimes when, you know, we're out of town.

426
00:28:21,814 --> 00:28:22,048
Rym: Not often.

427
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:22,671
Rym: Not often.

428
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:29,490
Rym: And this is just a video, a lot of people have rabbits or have seen rabbits, but don't, it's like they think rabbits just sit there.

429
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:32,028
Rym: Because if you lock a rabbit up in like a little hutch, it kind of just sits there.

430
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:36,310
Rym: But rabbits are about as smart as a low-end cat.

431
00:28:36,951 --> 00:28:40,630
Rym: So, if you've got a rabbit and then you let them run around, they act like a slightly dumb cat.

432
00:28:40,691 --> 00:28:42,005
Rym: Like, they're very, they're active.

433
00:28:42,025 --> 00:28:42,430
Rym: They play with them.

434
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,010
Scott: Yeah, they're not even smart enough to stay in the cardboard castle all the time.

435
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:50,770
Scott: They only go in there sometimes, and usually they go in the cardboard tunnel, which is not nearly as good as the cardboard castle.

436
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:53,989
Rym: The cardboard tunnel is much more defensible if someone like me is coming to pick them up.

437
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,804
Scott: No, the cardboard castle is superior in all aspects.

438
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,990
Rym: Plus, Scott, notice how he can get the toys into the tunnel.

439
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:02,350
Rym: He can't get the big pine cone into the cardboard castle.

440
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,090
Rym: Why not?

441
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,350
Rym: Because it's hard to get it in there.

442
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:05,381
Scott: No, because he's fucking stupid.

443
00:29:05,401 --> 00:29:06,109
Scott: I could get it in there.

444
00:29:08,711 --> 00:29:14,610
Rym: So, this is a video of a rabbit who, because, you know, our, like, our one, the white one, Theo, has a basket of toys.

445
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:21,110
Rym: And every day when we let him out, while we're not home, he empties the basket out and carries the toys around and plays with them, like throws them at things.

446
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,370
Rym: This is a video of a rabbit playing with a toy.

447
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:27,584
Rym: He has a, his is a doll of a rabbit that he carries around everywhere with him.

448
00:29:27,604 --> 00:29:29,470
Rym: the way a dog carries around his, like, favorite toy.

449
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,590
Rym: It's ridiculously adorable.

450
00:29:32,172 --> 00:29:38,489
Rym: And if you don't, if you've never interacted with rabbits before, you should watch this because they're probably not the way you think they are.

451
00:29:39,593 --> 00:29:41,069
Scott: They are who we thought they were.

452
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,317
Scott: Do you know what?

453
00:29:42,358 --> 00:29:43,169
Scott: You want to know something?

454
00:29:43,592 --> 00:29:43,810
Scott: Uh-huh.

455
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:49,490
Scott: Yesterday was the tenth anniversary of Play to Win the Game.

456
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:50,829
Scott: You don't just play.

457
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:52,140
Scott: You don't play it, you just play it.

458
00:29:52,726 --> 00:29:53,130
Scott: Play to win.

459
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:58,089
Rym: So, in the meta moment, the Book Club book is Patrick Rothfusses.

460
00:29:59,816 --> 00:30:00,410
Rym: You gonna say the name?

461
00:30:00,651 --> 00:30:01,189
Scott: The name of the wind.

462
00:30:01,354 --> 00:30:01,848
Rym: Name of the wind.

463
00:30:02,751 --> 00:30:03,650
Rym: Did you know the name of the wind?

464
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,450
Scott: Well, you said, you said you're gonna say the name.

465
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:07,590
Rym: Am I gonna learn the name of the wind in this first book?

466
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:08,229
Rym: Are you?

467
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:08,879
Rym: I don't know.

468
00:30:08,899 --> 00:30:08,981
Rym: Am I?

469
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:10,956
Scott: It's the name of the book.

470
00:30:10,996 --> 00:30:13,090
Scott: I mean, it would be kind of weird if you didn't, you know, learn anything.

471
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:14,850
Rym: Does it end with him learning the name of the wind?

472
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:18,810
Scott: It would be kind of weird if you didn't learn anything about the name of the wind in a book called The Name of the Wind.

473
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:22,790
Rym: Does he learn it from Master Loden or does he learn it from that crazy girl?

474
00:30:24,191 --> 00:30:27,169
Scott: You know, I can't really say the name of the wind.

475
00:30:27,611 --> 00:30:29,846
Scott: If I could, it would, I mean, I did it last week.

476
00:30:29,886 --> 00:30:30,470
Scott: It's not what happened.

477
00:30:32,315 --> 00:30:33,069
Scott: It wasn't too good.

478
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:37,690
Rym: So it's totally an aside, but in the forum, I think it was Matt who posted this.

479
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:41,270
Rym: He said that a friend of his said one of the funniest things he's ever said.

480
00:30:42,051 --> 00:30:45,290
Rym: I'm going to pull out the tweet because I took advantage of this.

481
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:50,045
Rym: Basically, he was like, what if Gagnam Style is actually a rain dance?

482
00:30:50,085 --> 00:30:51,470
Rym: and we brought this upon ourselves?

483
00:30:51,852 --> 00:30:52,944
Scott: I saw that around the Internet.

484
00:30:53,005 --> 00:30:53,450
Scott: It's not that funny.

485
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,270
Rym: Yeah, so basically he said this in our forum.

486
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,090
Scott: You think that's that funny?

487
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:56,431
Scott: No.

488
00:30:56,672 --> 00:30:59,650
Rym: So I posted, I was like, I'm totally going to steal that and tweet that.

489
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,450
Scott: I think he was not the originator of that.

490
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,689
Rym: No, his friend, he overheard his friend do it.

491
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:08,270
Scott: I think his friend saw it on Reddit or something because they saw a JPEG that predates your JPEG.

492
00:31:08,954 --> 00:31:09,870
Rym: I never made a JPEG.

493
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,645
Scott: Someone made a JPEG that predated whatever.

494
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:15,550
Rym: So all I did was I was like, I'm going to steal and tweet that.

495
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,216
Rym: So I tweeted it.

496
00:31:16,438 --> 00:31:17,690
Rym: in a sea of other things I tweeted.

497
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:25,861
Rym: I think I also tweeted about that My Little Pony doujin that Emily translated and Sonic put online, which is actually really good.

498
00:31:25,882 --> 00:31:26,387
Rym: I assume you're right.

499
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:29,530
Scott: Even the GeekNights IRC channel met a moment, met a moment.

500
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:37,930
Scott: And someone talked about how they had a friend who was at a comic convention in Japan who bought some MLP doujins and sent them to them in Europe.

501
00:31:38,031 --> 00:31:39,809
Scott: So I said, you got to scan that.

502
00:31:40,312 --> 00:31:42,510
Scott: So they scanned that and they put the JPEGs on Imgur.

503
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:49,110
Scott: And then I said, hey, Emily, check out this Japanese pony doujin that got someone to scan.

504
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:50,230
Rym: And it's actually pretty good.

505
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,750
Rym: There's that picture where Gilda, Pinkie Pie is like on Gilda.

506
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:53,390
Rym: Like, you miss me.

507
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:56,149
Scott: I'm really good at not doing stuff, but telling people to do stuff.

508
00:31:56,713 --> 00:31:58,890
Scott: Someone should hire me to do that.

509
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:00,450
Rym: Scott, that's how I want inheritance.

510
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:01,310
Rym: You know what we should do?

511
00:32:02,151 --> 00:32:06,370
Rym: You play the guy and I'll play your guard and we'll just fuck everybody up.

512
00:32:08,154 --> 00:32:09,310
Scott: Don't draw me out of the envelope.

513
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:17,990
Rym: So I tweeted this, among other tweets, and it is now the most retweeted thing I've ever tweeted in the history of Twitter.

514
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:24,070
Rym: It has been retweeted so many times that it turned off all retweet notifications because it flooded my email.

515
00:32:24,896 --> 00:32:26,730
Rym: It got retweeted back to me in a loop.

516
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:33,749
Rym: I started seeing my own tweet in my feed because people use these shitty old clients that do the old like RT space.

517
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:39,550
Rym: So I started getting my own bullshit retweeted back at me through multiple chains of people.

518
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:41,450
Scott: You know what I see in my feed all too often?

519
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:45,329
Scott: Someone so favorite in a video, Rainbow Dash, oh my gosh.

520
00:32:46,754 --> 00:32:48,130
Scott: That is the thing I see most often.

521
00:32:48,371 --> 00:32:53,450
Rym: I get that more for Gooney's Game of Thrones than I do for my Kanye pony.

522
00:32:54,053 --> 00:32:57,310
Scott: Someone emailed us about Gooney's Game of Thrones, something weird, I ignored it.

523
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:58,009
Rym: The Brazilian thing?

524
00:32:58,533 --> 00:32:58,789
Scott: Yes.

525
00:32:58,890 --> 00:32:59,609
Scott: So here's the deal.

526
00:33:00,434 --> 00:33:02,050
Rym: I got a lot of emails about that.

527
00:33:02,552 --> 00:33:04,290
Rym: So that went viral in Brazil.

528
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:05,079
Scott: Okay.

529
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:07,928
Scott: How viral in Brazil?

530
00:33:08,391 --> 00:33:10,529
Scott: So a guy- Do they love the Goonies in Brazil?

531
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:17,410
Rym: So a guy fan subbed it into Brazilian and asked me if I would add that as an alternate language on the video in annotations.

532
00:33:17,852 --> 00:33:18,589
Scott: Okay, so why not?

533
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,529
Rym: So I'm going to figure out how to do that and do it.

534
00:33:20,912 --> 00:33:24,209
Rym: And I got all these people from Brazil now who are like, "Oh my God, that was the best thing

535
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:24,410
Rym: ever.".

536
00:33:24,471 --> 00:33:25,530
Rym: They all got my email address.

537
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,890
Scott: So Brazilians know both Goonies and Game of Thrones.

538
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:31,906
Rym: I should email all of them and be like, "You fuckers ruined Orkut.

539
00:33:31,966 --> 00:33:32,488
Rym: I'm giving you

540
00:33:32,568 --> 00:33:32,909
Rym: nothing.".

541
00:33:33,133 --> 00:33:33,383
Scott: Yeah.

542
00:33:34,451 --> 00:33:36,748
Scott: I can still be using Orkut today instead of Facebook or G+.

543
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:37,508
Scott: You know what?

544
00:33:37,952 --> 00:33:38,629
Rym: Orkut was great.

545
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:42,030
Rym: Didn't scale well because Orkut had one fatal flaw.

546
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:42,926
Scott: Brazilians.

547
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:47,350
Rym: There was literally no way to deal with someone who has no etiquette.

548
00:33:47,855 --> 00:33:48,167
Scott: That's true.

549
00:33:48,672 --> 00:33:51,589
Rym: If someone decides to spam, there's literally no control over that.

550
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:52,989
Scott: Who knows how Orkut has changed though?

551
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:56,509
Rym: Apparently it's a den of kiddie porn and there's lots of lawsuits around it.

552
00:33:56,771 --> 00:33:57,749
Scott: Why does Google keep it up?

553
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:00,690
Rym: Because it's also the most popular social network in Brazil.

554
00:34:00,971 --> 00:34:01,609
Scott: Does it make them money?

555
00:34:01,953 --> 00:34:02,365
Scott: I don't know.

556
00:34:02,971 --> 00:34:04,150
Scott: Well, I'm not going there if there's kiddie porn.

557
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,970
Rym: Actually, it's really hard to get money out of Brazil.

558
00:34:07,516 --> 00:34:07,684
Scott: Okay.

559
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:14,989
Rym: So if you have a company and you have stuff like you have an office in Brazil, usually what happens is that office becomes ... This is kind of like the Rym business aside.

560
00:34:15,952 --> 00:34:17,409
Rym: You have all this money you're making.

561
00:34:18,114 --> 00:34:20,670
Rym: You can't easily get the money out of Brazil.

562
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:25,110
Rym: So all you can do really is reinvest it into that office.

563
00:34:25,936 --> 00:34:26,889
Scott: Or something else in Brazil.

564
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:27,241
Scott: Yeah.

565
00:34:27,551 --> 00:34:32,010
Rym: So you'll either spin up other businesses in Brazil or you'll just have one office.

566
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:35,949
Scott: Why don't you use the money to lobby the Brazilian government to make it easier to get the money out of Brazil?

567
00:34:38,254 --> 00:34:38,870
Rym: Nah, nah, nah.

568
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:40,670
Scott: Why doesn't everyone team up to do that?

569
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:47,070
Rym: Scott, all I've learned about South America is you do not want to get involved with the government of South America in any capacity, any country.

570
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:48,409
Scott: I don't know much about the government of Brazil.

571
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:49,382
Rym: South and Central America, no.

572
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:55,130
Scott: I don't know much about the government of Brazil, but the very few things I do know are totally cool.

573
00:34:55,531 --> 00:34:57,930
Scott: Like the awesome Creative Commons Culture Minister guy.

574
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,950
Rym: Oh dude, it's all nerds down there.

575
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:03,050
Rym: Everyone in the financial industry I met was a super nerd.

576
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:06,386
Rym: Chun Lees all over ... That's an aside, but it's cool.

577
00:35:06,407 --> 00:35:06,970
Rym: people down there.

578
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:10,950
Rym: Guy introduced me to himself by his screen name, not his real name.

579
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,108
Scott: Just like you.

580
00:35:12,691 --> 00:35:15,410
Rym: And that screen name was Trek.

581
00:35:15,792 --> 00:35:18,990
Rym: Dude knows more about Star Trek than anyone I've ever met in my life.

582
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,109
Rym: And independently of that is a really cool guy.

583
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,270
Scott: I think you talked about this guy before.

584
00:35:22,932 --> 00:35:23,154
Rym: I know.

585
00:35:23,174 --> 00:35:24,849
Rym: I also really just made a dig at Star Trek people.

586
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:27,322
Scott: Let us go on to talk about the hurricane.

587
00:35:27,503 --> 00:35:28,950
Scott: name name name.

588
00:35:29,231 --> 00:35:29,529
Rym: Oh, okay.

589
00:35:30,191 --> 00:35:32,393
Rym: So there's a hurricane and ...

590
00:35:32,393 --> 00:35:33,569
Scott: It blew past us.

591
00:35:34,331 --> 00:35:34,969
Rym: So I prepared.

592
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:36,190
Rym: So how did you prepare?

593
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:41,930
Rym: One, I filled two buckets with water in case I lost water pressure and had to poop.

594
00:35:42,295 --> 00:35:42,509
Scott: Okay.

595
00:35:43,034 --> 00:35:45,310
Rym: I filled every water bottle I owned with water and put in the fridge.

596
00:35:45,691 --> 00:35:48,410
Rym: Because you know, say I lose water for a couple days.

597
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:51,230
Rym: If I didn't store water, that would actually be dangerous.

598
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:55,208
Rym: I had enough water for like three or four days if I needed it.

599
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:59,849
Rym: Filled the hot water heater with water to make tea and have more water.

600
00:36:01,051 --> 00:36:04,410
Rym: And I ran the dishwasher because I didn't want anything stinky in my apartment.

601
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:08,149
Scott: I ran the dishwasher so I would have clean dishes upon which to eat.

602
00:36:09,431 --> 00:36:12,250
Rym: I kept my cell phone charged and I kept my energy charged.

603
00:36:12,392 --> 00:36:13,329
Scott: I closed the windows.

604
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:15,350
Rym: I charged both laptops that I own.

605
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:19,350
Scott: I taped the GoPro to the window so that it could time lapse.

606
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,511
Rym: I made sure that my ...

607
00:36:21,511 --> 00:36:23,690
Scott: I bought a half gallon of orange juice.

608
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:27,970
Rym: I made sure that my FiOS connection was plugged into my UPS so I could use my laptop and stay online.

609
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:31,210
Scott: I went to the ATM and got pictures of Andrew Jackson.

610
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,282
Rym: I pulled out $500 in cash and kept it around.

611
00:36:34,632 --> 00:36:35,810
Scott: Only 10 pictures of Andrew Jackson.

612
00:36:37,033 --> 00:36:39,169
Rym: Oh, dude, the ATM downstairs has 10s in it now.

613
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:40,296
Rym: Yeah.

614
00:36:41,071 --> 00:36:41,850
Scott: Is that the one at the Chase?

615
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:43,870
Rym: No, it's the one at that Bodega place.

616
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:44,422
Scott: Oh, fuck that one.

617
00:36:46,391 --> 00:36:50,050
Scott: And then I went inside my apartment and locked the door and stayed inside and didn't leave.

618
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,950
Rym: I started playing video games, watching TNG on Netflix.

619
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,609
Scott: I played Link to the Past.

620
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,509
Scott: I only have a few dungeons left.

621
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,810
Scott: I'm in the Ice Temple and I got to the boss.

622
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,770
Scott: I couldn't beat him because I didn't have enough magic.

623
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:02,770
Rym: And occasionally, I went out on the balcony.

624
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:05,149
Rym: At one point, I went up on the roof to see what was doing.

625
00:37:05,471 --> 00:37:07,589
Scott: I considered going on the roof and thought better of it.

626
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,290
Rym: So here's what we did.

627
00:37:08,611 --> 00:37:13,410
Scott: Because when I thought about going on the roof, suddenly the wind gusts were amplified.

628
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,228
Scott: And I said, "Yeah, don't want to get blown off the

629
00:37:15,249 --> 00:37:15,330
Scott: roof.".

630
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:16,510
Rym: I was outside during one of those moments.

631
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,710
Scott: Our roof has no sort of way to keep from falling off.

632
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:23,690
Rym: So we were on the balcony looking out because we're pretty well protected.

633
00:37:24,071 --> 00:37:25,909
Rym: And there's an under-construction building next to us.

634
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:31,430
Rym: And let me tell you, the entire hurricane, it looks like a scene in a movie where there's a wizard fighting.

635
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:32,610
Scott: Like Pat LeVoir?

636
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:33,910
Rym: Yeah, like Pat LeVoir.

637
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:34,729
Scott: The first one?

638
00:37:34,971 --> 00:37:39,030
Rym: Or take the fire away, but when it came in, it was fighting in that library.

639
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:42,170
Rym: This is what the outside of the library would have sounded like.

640
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,610
Rym: Jesus Christ, it was awesome.

641
00:37:44,472 --> 00:37:46,609
Rym: I was kind of worried because basically the building's not done.

642
00:37:47,251 --> 00:37:47,828
Rym: So it's open.

643
00:37:48,651 --> 00:37:50,950
Rym: All the floors have no walls and it's way tall.

644
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:56,810
Rym: And every floor has the steel beams that hold drywall up, but nothing else.

645
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:03,650
Rym: So those beams were banging and clattering and breaking and shuttering and making one fuck of a racket.

646
00:38:04,052 --> 00:38:07,090
Rym: I was waiting for one to just come flying out and impale something.

647
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:09,310
Rym: But nothing like that happened.

648
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,810
Rym: We're standing on the balcony and suddenly it's making all this noise.

649
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,566
Rym: And suddenly the noise escalated to a degree that I was like,

650
00:38:14,586 --> 00:38:15,029
Rym: "Ugh!".

651
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:16,050
Rym: And then we went inside.

652
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,890
Scott: Yeah, I reconnoitered my neighborhood after the coast was clear.

653
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:19,969
Rym: Good use of a word.

654
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:21,009
Scott: A couple days, what?

655
00:38:21,651 --> 00:38:22,821
Rym: Most people don't use that word.

656
00:38:22,841 --> 00:38:23,305
Rym: It's a good word.

657
00:38:23,325 --> 00:38:23,950
Rym: I like that word a lot.

658
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:24,750
Scott: You don't know that word?

659
00:38:24,851 --> 00:38:25,280
Rym: I know that word.

660
00:38:25,301 --> 00:38:25,750
Rym: I like it a lot.

661
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:26,550
Scott: It's a necessary word.

662
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:29,090
Scott: And the only thing that was wrong was a downed tree.

663
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:30,050
Scott: All the businesses were open.

664
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:32,390
Scott: People were walking and biking and all over the place.

665
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,189
Scott: There was no problem.

666
00:38:33,612 --> 00:38:46,570
Scott: The only problems, as usual, when it comes to natural disasters, such as, you know, is that people put their houses in dangerous places and if it's not just your vacation home, what the fuck?

667
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:47,850
Rym: Well, well, well, well.

668
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:55,070
Scott: I mean, I feel very badly for somebody who has a house in a place and the house is destroyed and their life is ruined.

669
00:38:55,490 --> 00:39:01,430
Rym: A good chunk of Connecticut, basically everywhere but where we are, is still fucked and won't have power for maybe weeks.

670
00:39:01,852 --> 00:39:02,435
Scott: That's true.

671
00:39:03,018 --> 00:39:05,169
Scott: But not having power, you can still live.

672
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,690
Rym: It's tough, though, when you also don't have running water.

673
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,184
Scott: Uh, they have water.

674
00:39:09,204 --> 00:39:12,170
Scott: My parents- A lot of people don't have water because- My parents have water but they don't have power.

675
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:14,089
Rym: And no cell service in a lot of places.

676
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:18,050
Scott: Uh, they think they have- the phone still works because the phone company has generators.

677
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:20,830
Rym: No, this was a $20 to $30 billion storm in terms of damage.

678
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:24,590
Rym: It hit a lot of places that are not traditionally thought of to be in dangerous places.

679
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:26,770
Scott: You know, I feel badly for anyone whose life is ruined.

680
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:29,887
Scott: I think about, like, my whole apartment just getting set on fire and I'm like,

681
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:30,229
Scott: "No.".

682
00:39:30,592 --> 00:39:32,130
Rym: Atlantic City got proper fucked.

683
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,830
Scott: That would be the worst thing ever, right?

684
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:35,850
Rym: Like, Atlantic City apparently flooded entirely.

685
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:43,110
Scott: I cannot but empathize, you know, how bad it is for somebody to have the worst, almost the worst possible thing happen to them.

686
00:39:43,191 --> 00:39:45,110
Scott: Losing everything pretty much but your life, right?

687
00:39:45,311 --> 00:39:49,390
Scott: Or, in a few cases, even your life, that is the worst possible thing.

688
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:52,550
Rym: But, but- I'm just thinking of rarity.

689
00:39:52,870 --> 00:40:01,750
Scott: I do have to hold back, in a very small sense at least, in some cases a large sense, why did you put your house right on the beach, right?

690
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:12,350
Scott: So, what about the guy- If that's a vacation house that's mostly empty and you only really vacation there and it gets knocked over, you were rich, you had a second house, I don't feel too bad for you that your beach house got knocked down, right?

691
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:17,369
Scott: That's like, "Oh, your Ferrari was smashed by a fallen tree, I will play this tiny violin for

692
00:40:17,409 --> 00:40:17,470
Scott: you.".

693
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:27,649
Scott: But, you put your primary house on the beach, you could afford the beach house, which means you could have afforded a non-beach house instead, but that was your only house?

694
00:40:28,852 --> 00:40:31,350
Scott: Not a smart move there, right?

695
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:40,610
Scott: You don't build your only house on the fault line or on the cliff where there's mudslides or in places in the middle of Kansas where there's tornadoes all the time, right?

696
00:40:40,972 --> 00:40:41,748
Scott: You just don't do that.

697
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:57,030
Scott: And if you do do that, I will still feel badly that you had a horrible thing happen to you and your life was ruined, but I'll feel slightly less badly than I will for the person who put their house in a safe place and had it ruined, although they took reasonable precautions.

698
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:03,748
Scott: It's like, "Oh, you put your thing in a precarious position and it fell, yeah, that's what was gonna happen, we know

699
00:41:03,788 --> 00:41:03,949
Scott: that.".

700
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:13,650
Scott: And if you look around New York City, most of the destroyed things were people living on tiny slivers of island.

701
00:41:14,873 --> 00:41:18,370
Rym: And the island that flooded in the middle, you know, Manhattan.

702
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,050
Scott: Well, Manhattan itself, right?

703
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:22,270
Rym: More Manhattan is fucked.

704
00:41:22,732 --> 00:41:23,709
Scott: It is out of power.

705
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:34,270
Rym: And subway, and the tunnels are still flooded and all the- But there isn't significant damage in terms of your house, your apartment was destroyed and your life was ruined.

706
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:34,810
Rym: No, no, nothing like that.

707
00:41:35,011 --> 00:41:36,450
Scott: Right, so that's what I'm talking about.

708
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:41,170
Rym: Or how about by 14th Street where they had to evacuate all the intensive care babies from the hospital.

709
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,769
Scott: Someone tweeted this- But none of them, all of them lived.

710
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,309
Rym: Yes, due to a heroic effort and a lot of luck.

711
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,010
Scott: Of course.

712
00:41:47,353 --> 00:41:49,189
Rym: Now, here's what bothers me.

713
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:57,230
Rym: The hospital had all these problems, and yet the financial sector basically came online the next day like nothing happened.

714
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:00,190
Scott: Well, a hospital, the technology is much busted.

715
00:42:00,992 --> 00:42:04,630
Scott: We can make a whole episode about the crappy, much busted technology of hospitals.

716
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:08,750
Rym: We're not gonna make this the episode of talking about the political social ramifications of America.

717
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:14,090
Scott: Also, Wall Street buildings are typically large, more modern, and more durable.

718
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:19,430
Scott: In some cases, like the stock exchange itself is made of stone.

719
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:22,089
Scott: It's a flood isn't really gonna bother that fucker.

720
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:25,069
Rym: There's the side problems, there's just more money in the financials.

721
00:42:25,754 --> 00:42:26,370
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

722
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:27,730
Rym: I worked in hospitals.

723
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:31,670
Scott: The National Reserve, the Federal Reserve, flood ain't gonna matter.

724
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:40,390
Rym: IT in hospitals, in my experience, was pretty corrupt and pretty incompetent and way overpriced and way shittier than most other industries.

725
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:40,808
Scott: Yup.

726
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:46,350
Scott: But yeah, damaged infrastructure like that is bad because we all pay for that together.

727
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:47,441
Scott: It is a shared cost.

728
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,849
Scott: It's like, "Oh, the federal government comes in and helps

729
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:50,950
Scott: you.".

730
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:53,510
Scott: Yeah, in other words, we all pay for that, right?

731
00:42:54,050 --> 00:43:02,030
Scott: Our taxes are increased and our deficit is increased because there is a disaster that we must all pay to fix together.

732
00:43:02,533 --> 00:43:05,130
Scott: And that is sucky, but that is what happens.

733
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:13,770
Scott: We set aside money for that, just like anyone should set aside money in their personal budget for a disaster, because it will happen at least once in your life.

734
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:15,172
Scott: You know, just about.

735
00:43:15,232 --> 00:43:22,390
Scott: no matter where you live, there is some sort of disaster that can happen, and if you live long enough, will happen.

736
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:25,727
Scott: A hurricane, a tornado, an earthquake, a fire, a blizzard.

737
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:30,490
Scott: You know, name a place for me on Earth where a bad thing can't happen.

738
00:43:31,093 --> 00:43:33,030
Scott: I'll move to that place tomorrow, right?

739
00:43:33,251 --> 00:43:33,955
Rym: Actually, you know what?

740
00:43:34,256 --> 00:43:37,250
Rym: The Midwest is pretty much one of the safest places- Tornadoes?

741
00:43:38,637 --> 00:43:38,850
Rym: Blizzards?

742
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:40,390
Rym: No, the northern part of the Midwest.

743
00:43:40,852 --> 00:43:41,230
Scott: Blizzards.

744
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:44,470
Rym: Dangerous Blizzards are actually not an issue because of the- It is possible.

745
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:51,990
Rym: It's so unlikely, and even huge Blizzards are actually much more readily dealt with because it's very easy to store enough supplies to ride it out.

746
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:54,389
Scott: There, you know, many bad things can happen.

747
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:56,908
Rym: No, very few compared to most other places in the

748
00:43:56,928 --> 00:43:56,969
Rym: U.S.,

749
00:43:56,989 --> 00:43:57,150
Rym: actually.

750
00:43:57,191 --> 00:43:58,689
Scott: Oh, the same, but things can happen.

751
00:43:58,994 --> 00:43:59,128
Scott: Yes.

752
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:00,449
Scott: It's not a perfectly safe place.

753
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:04,030
Rym: But the likelihood is so much lower there that that is probably the safest place you could be.

754
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,848
Scott: There are many safe places you can be.

755
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,070
Scott: But, I mean, deserts, you think, oh, deserts weigh safe.

756
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:08,336
Scott: No.

757
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:11,321
Rym: Drought is- Drought is deadly.

758
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:11,829
Rym: I know that.

759
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:14,090
Rym: That's why I didn't say the desert was safe.

760
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:15,869
Scott: I'm just saying, there are unsafe places.

761
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:18,362
Scott: Anyway- And the place I'm in?

762
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:20,243
Rym: Pretty safe.

763
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:21,461
Rym: Yeah, I think you said it best.

764
00:44:21,501 --> 00:44:22,410
Rym: It's worth the rent we pay.

765
00:44:22,531 --> 00:44:24,010
Scott: We're pretty safe here, I think, right?

766
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:26,110
Scott: We're not right on the water, you know?

767
00:44:26,332 --> 00:44:27,250
Scott: I'm on the third floor.

768
00:44:27,351 --> 00:44:30,690
Scott: If a flood reaches the third floor, that's a fucking miracle.

769
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:38,710
Scott: I salute that flood, and I will accept the damage it does, because the third floor flood, that is apocalyptic Bible shit.

770
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:40,030
Rym: So here are my observations.

771
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:51,570
Rym: One, when I went out the next day for a run and biking around, pretty much all the traffic lights were- Like, there were a few traffic lights that were fucked up, but they were mostly all functioning.

772
00:44:52,671 --> 00:44:55,350
Rym: Everyone was just running red lights, driving the wrong way on the road.

773
00:44:55,653 --> 00:44:57,246
Rym: People were driving like it was Mad Max.

774
00:44:58,310 --> 00:44:58,970
Scott: Yeah, so I don't drive.

775
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:07,649
Rym: But the roads were normal, so I was biking, and jackasses were literally just running red lights without even looking, and everyone's just driving like there's some sort of crazy disaster going on.

776
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:08,834
Scott: That's the news.

777
00:45:08,894 --> 00:45:11,889
Scott: That's what the news creates, that psychology in people, right?

778
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:16,184
Scott: Yeah, but I feel like- How is that anything different from driving in India?

779
00:45:16,204 --> 00:45:16,730
Scott: It's not so bad.

780
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:17,910
Rym: No, because here's the problem.

781
00:45:18,291 --> 00:45:19,407
Rym: What it shows me is this.

782
00:45:20,252 --> 00:45:27,050
Rym: If the police are not available in New York, social order starts to break down within about five fucking minutes.

783
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:27,807
Scott: We know that.

784
00:45:28,574 --> 00:45:30,010
Rym: But I saw it in action, literally.

785
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:36,150
Rym: I've never seen someone run a red light, like straight up run a red light in this city before.

786
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:36,507
Rym: I have.

787
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:43,030
Rym: The day after the hurricane, everyone was running red lights, and driving just like in the middle of the lanes on perfectly fine roads.

788
00:45:46,133 --> 00:45:48,069
Rym: And there were a lot of bikers out, but that was a separate thing.

789
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:49,452
Rym: Observation two.

790
00:45:50,637 --> 00:45:58,990
Rym: People who are walking, people who are pedestrians, don't know how to walk, but it didn't bother me that much until I had a bike over the Queensborough Bridge yesterday.

791
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:02,361
Rym: The pedestrians literally blocked the entire bridge.

792
00:46:02,401 --> 00:46:03,185
Rym: It took me 35 minutes.

793
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:08,717
Scott: Today, I was trying to get on the subway to go- 35 minutes!

794
00:46:08,757 --> 00:46:11,690
Rym: It takes me three minutes to get over that thing on a normal day.

795
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:14,721
Scott: To get to work, I took the end to 49th Street.

796
00:46:14,802 --> 00:46:18,235
Scott: The 57th Street was closed because of that crane thing, but I just got right in.

797
00:46:18,596 --> 00:46:22,510
Scott: But, 49th Street, for whatever reason, no uptown trains at that station.

798
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:27,407
Scott: Also, I couldn't go to 57th Street, so the only option was to go south to 42nd Street.

799
00:46:30,471 --> 00:46:31,778
Scott: The tourists today!

800
00:46:31,899 --> 00:46:33,750
Scott: You'd think there would be not so many tourists.

801
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:35,361
Rym: No, because they're all in the hotels in Manhattan.

802
00:46:35,381 --> 00:46:36,689
Rym: They can't get out and they can't get anywhere.

803
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:40,670
Scott: Today, they were so much worse at walking than they usually are.

804
00:46:41,191 --> 00:46:45,430
Scott: It was so bad, the walking, to get to the subway station.

805
00:46:46,173 --> 00:46:49,005
Scott: I really wish I could have just pushed people over the same way.

806
00:46:49,025 --> 00:46:50,130
Scott: those guys ran red lights.

807
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:54,230
Rym: Oh, this is an aside, but I actually shoved a fat lady out of my way to get on the subway.

808
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:55,310
Scott: Physically, you shoved?

809
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,650
Scott: Woah, let's talk about this.

810
00:46:58,291 --> 00:46:59,650
Rym: So, this had nothing to do with the hurricane.

811
00:47:00,672 --> 00:47:05,787
Rym: So, I was running late for a thing, and the sixth train came up, door opened.

812
00:47:05,827 --> 00:47:06,970
Rym: It was pretty crowded.

813
00:47:07,773 --> 00:47:08,810
Scott: This was pre-cane.

814
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:11,237
Rym: Yeah, and there was a door that opens, right?

815
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:13,424
Rym: And there is plenty of space.

816
00:47:13,484 --> 00:47:15,350
Rym: Like, tons of space behind the door.

817
00:47:15,631 --> 00:47:20,590
Rym: There is a fat woman standing in front of the door, blocking the entire thing, and plenty of space behind her.

818
00:47:21,831 --> 00:47:23,500
Rym: The other two doors are full.

819
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,310
Rym: You can't really get into them because there's a huge crowd of people.

820
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:28,968
Rym: But I'm standing right in front of her, and I look at her in the eye and say, "Hey, can I get

821
00:47:29,008 --> 00:47:29,169
Rym: by?".

822
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,285
Rym: And she ignores me.

823
00:47:31,532 --> 00:47:34,330
Rym: So, I start to squeeze past, and she still ignores me.

824
00:47:35,611 --> 00:47:38,546
Rym: So, I shoved past her, and I got onto the train.

825
00:47:38,566 --> 00:47:39,390
Rym: There was plenty of room.

826
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:42,130
Rym: She turns around and starts flipping out at me for being so rude.

827
00:47:43,333 --> 00:47:44,476
Rym: And I let her be.

828
00:47:44,536 --> 00:47:45,700
Rym: I just ignored her.

829
00:47:46,141 --> 00:47:49,029
Rym: I could have done the whole, "I tried to get around you, but I

830
00:47:49,089 --> 00:47:49,390
Rym: couldn't.".

831
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:50,610
Rym: But I felt that would have been mean.

832
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:54,110
Rym: So, I literally just ignored her, and she yelled at me for the entire ride.

833
00:47:55,534 --> 00:47:56,530
Scott: She didn't do anything, though, right?

834
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:58,290
Rym: No, she just kept yelling at me about how rude I was.

835
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:01,549
Rym: And she looked around the train like, "You know how when people who are mad...".

836
00:48:01,811 --> 00:48:04,629
Scott: You didn't flip out a phone camera and video the crazy lady?

837
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:05,018
Rym: No.

838
00:48:05,334 --> 00:48:06,230
Rym: No one else did?

839
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:09,330
Rym: I was using my phone to read the stupid book.

840
00:48:09,691 --> 00:48:11,170
Scott: No one else did this?

841
00:48:11,312 --> 00:48:12,070
Rym: I don't know if they did it or not.

842
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:16,909
Rym: If you see a video of a fat lady flipping out on a guy with long hair, it's probably that fat lady.

843
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:18,170
Scott: Search YouTube.

844
00:48:19,351 --> 00:48:31,730
Rym: The coup de gras was that she's trying to do that thing, which we've talked about before, on trains, where she's trying to make eye-counting for someone else and do that huff that indignant people do, to try to get them to huff with her, to share the indignation.

845
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:33,101
Rym: And she's like, "Huh,

846
00:48:33,386 --> 00:48:33,549
Rym: huh.".

847
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:34,595
Rym: And she keeps looking.

848
00:48:34,676 --> 00:48:37,110
Rym: One by one, she's looking at people and trying to get them mad.

849
00:48:38,892 --> 00:48:43,449
Rym: And I'm surprised that the other people on the train did not, in fact, break out into a round of applause for me.

850
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:48,410
Rym: So she had no luck in her fishing expedition for a co-drama person.

851
00:48:49,921 --> 00:48:50,410
Rym: It was great.

852
00:48:52,014 --> 00:48:53,570
Rym: It felt kind of bad, but only a little bad.

853
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:58,150
Rym: But it was the first time I've actually shoved someone out of my way in New York.

854
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:00,710
Rym: Maybe that's an achievement.

855
00:49:01,574 --> 00:49:02,429
Rym: Maybe I've leveled up.

856
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:06,709
Rym: Maybe Mayor Bloomberg is going to come to me and be like, "Congratulations, you're actually a real New Yorker

857
00:49:06,749 --> 00:49:06,930
Rym: now.".

858
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:07,944
Scott: Here's the golden fist.

859
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:09,790
Rym: Here's the key to the real subway.

860
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:10,809
Scott: Here's the golden fist.

861
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:13,890
Rym: Here's the key to the real subway and the real Times Square.

862
00:49:14,471 --> 00:49:16,162
Scott: Dude, if you get that, let me know.

863
00:49:16,182 --> 00:49:17,349
Scott: I'm going to start pushing people away.

864
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,770
Scott: I've been in a lot of hurricanes, actually, in my life.

865
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:24,219
Rym: This is the first one I've ever been in.

866
00:49:24,279 --> 00:49:25,589
Rym: The last hurricane, Irene.

867
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:28,210
Scott: Oh, because you were in the Midwest or Rochester.

868
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:31,229
Rym: Yeah, and then I was in Seattle for PAX during the last one.

869
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:34,490
Scott: Being in Connecticut, New York, in my life, there have been two or three hurricanes.

870
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:38,034
Scott: The only one of them was ever... I mean, Hurricane Andrew.

871
00:49:38,054 --> 00:49:42,489
Scott: that really destroyed the fuck out of Florida didn't hurt us so bad, but it did come by us.

872
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:44,459
Scott: But there was one even earlier.

873
00:49:44,499 --> 00:49:46,050
Scott: I forget the name of because I was so young.

874
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:49,370
Scott: But that was the only one that really fucked us over.

875
00:49:49,451 --> 00:49:51,490
Scott: And we knew it was coming, even in those days.

876
00:49:52,272 --> 00:49:54,030
Scott: And we were putting duct tape on the windows.

877
00:49:54,651 --> 00:49:55,279
Rym: Oh, no, no.

878
00:49:55,299 --> 00:49:56,029
Rym: You shouldn't do that.

879
00:49:56,511 --> 00:49:57,404
Scott: It was the olden days.

880
00:49:57,424 --> 00:49:57,850
Scott: We didn't know better.

881
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:00,005
Rym: Oh, Scott, we've known not to do that since the '80s.

882
00:50:00,851 --> 00:50:01,904
Scott: Well, this was in the '80s.

883
00:50:02,913 --> 00:50:04,747
Rym: So, you know what, Emily and I were walking.

884
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:08,787
Rym: I think a lot of people don't realize that taping your windows not only doesn't help, but it can hurt.

885
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:12,570
Rym: But every frickin' business taped up their windows.

886
00:50:12,711 --> 00:50:14,290
Rym: Usually with masking tape, too.

887
00:50:14,932 --> 00:50:16,179
Scott: That was the only time we ever did that.

888
00:50:16,199 --> 00:50:18,150
Scott: We've never done it again because now we know better.

889
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:19,795
Scott: But that's how I'm selling.

890
00:50:19,835 --> 00:50:23,750
Scott: how old this hurricane was, is that we taped up the windows, did not know better.

891
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:26,189
Rym: What's interesting is I've never been in hurricane kind of winds.

892
00:50:27,431 --> 00:50:29,670
Rym: I've been in way more violent storms.

893
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:30,473
Scott: You can't walk.

894
00:50:30,493 --> 00:50:35,470
Scott: Yeah, this one that came through was not as violent, at least where I was.

895
00:50:35,671 --> 00:50:39,790
Rym: Well, when we went into the roof, the elevators were down, so we snuck up.

896
00:50:40,535 --> 00:50:41,825
Rym: They were like, "Don't fuckin' go in the

897
00:50:41,865 --> 00:50:42,248
Rym: elevators.".

898
00:50:42,791 --> 00:50:44,198
Rym: So, of course, we snuck up the stairs.

899
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:46,650
Rym: We get up to the top, we open it, the door, a little bit.

900
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:47,614
Rym: It's pretty calm.

901
00:50:48,036 --> 00:50:50,348
Rym: And we see that the regular door out is blocked.

902
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:54,550
Rym: Like, the building doesn't want you fuckin' goin' on the roof, which is understandable.

903
00:50:55,351 --> 00:50:57,430
Rym: So we open the door, and I look, and I'm like, "You know, it doesn't seem so...".

904
00:50:57,470 --> 00:50:58,416
Rym: And then the wind came again.

905
00:50:58,456 --> 00:50:59,403
Rym: I was like, "Oh, okay.

906
00:51:00,067 --> 00:51:00,389
Scott: Okay.".

907
00:51:00,591 --> 00:51:02,770
Scott: Yeah, a hurricane is like being in a fuckin' wind tunnel.

908
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:07,830
Rym: But I've been in way, way more violent storms in my life.

909
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:10,570
Rym: In fact, I've gone out biking through way more violent storms.

910
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:24,310
Scott: I was gonna say, this hurricane had the strong hurricane winds, but because of our location, if you watch the storm move on the radar, the part of it that was raining, thundering, lightning, and in the high altitudes, snowing like crazy, did not pass over us.

911
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:28,750
Scott: We were on the sort of right side of the thing, which only had mostly wind.

912
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:30,563
Scott: There was very little rain or anything.

913
00:51:30,583 --> 00:51:31,630
Scott: I mean, it was wet outside.

914
00:51:32,072 --> 00:51:42,710
Scott: But all of the flooding was not due necessarily to rain and coming from the sky, but just the wind pushing the water up, you know, and a big surge up from, you know, the rivers.

915
00:51:42,851 --> 00:51:50,550
Scott: And just the water level and high tide especially just went way the fuck up and just got water all over things that were too close to the coast.

916
00:51:51,192 --> 00:52:01,670
Scott: And it wasn't, you know, tons of rain on things, which is why being slightly inland enough not to be near enough to East River, not really any action going on over here, right?

917
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:14,690
Scott: But people who were directly on the water, people who live on small islands in between the ocean and the bay, were completely devastated because the island 100% went under water as the wind blew the water through.

918
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:22,290
Rym: Now, the only reason I didn't actually go out was that, you know, I've never experienced hurricanes and all this sort of thing.

919
00:52:22,571 --> 00:52:23,308
Scott: I didn't know you hadn't.

920
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:30,690
Rym: Because it's a different kind of wind, I could not accurately assess the level of danger I would be in.

921
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:34,489
Rym: Like if I went out running and then like the wind changed, I wouldn't know.

922
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:38,865
Scott: The worst that could happen is number one, a piece of debris could hit you.

923
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:48,564
Scott: It's not like a tornado where you're spinning in a circle with a bunch of debris at a zillion miles an hour, but, you know, some piece of wood could just come at you at 30 miles an hour or so.

924
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:57,190
Rym: Emily shared the fairly commonly known fact that in Japan, most people are killed in hurricanes and typhoons by roof tiles.

925
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:59,750
Rym: Because their roof tiles are those big red kind of things.

926
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:02,830
Scott: We don't have loose roof tiles here, but there's plenty of loose things.

927
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:06,870
Scott: The second most dangerous thing actually is the wind can knock you the fuck down.

928
00:53:07,971 --> 00:53:11,689
Scott: I once, it was a hurricane that didn't really do a lot of damage.

929
00:53:12,291 --> 00:53:15,870
Scott: But I was maybe a little older, maybe middle school, maybe a little before then.

930
00:53:16,352 --> 00:53:19,090
Scott: And I had to bring the neighbors some sugar or eggs in the hurricane.

931
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:20,150
Scott: So I crossed the street and crossed back.

932
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:21,016
Rym: Why is it always eggs?

933
00:53:21,218 --> 00:53:22,810
Rym: Just go without eggs for a few days.

934
00:53:23,751 --> 00:53:25,164
Scott: And I think it might have been sugar.

935
00:53:25,184 --> 00:53:25,809
Scott: I don't know what it was.

936
00:53:25,931 --> 00:53:27,310
Scott: But I had to cross the street and cross back.

937
00:53:27,391 --> 00:53:28,950
Scott: And I had, you know, a raincoat and an umbrella.

938
00:53:29,431 --> 00:53:32,670
Scott: And this was sort of sideways rain situation here, right?

939
00:53:33,052 --> 00:53:35,830
Scott: And it was crazy rain, thunder, and lightning.

940
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:37,369
Scott: And I just crossed the street and crossed back.

941
00:53:38,411 --> 00:53:39,759
Scott: I fell down in the street.

942
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:41,390
Scott: The wind just knocked me the hell down.

943
00:53:41,974 --> 00:53:43,630
Scott: It wasn't enough to really damage things.

944
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:45,970
Scott: I don't remember any big trees coming down that time.

945
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:47,150
Scott: You know, some branches maybe.

946
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:51,270
Scott: But yeah, the wind can knock you down, especially if you're a little kid.

947
00:53:51,830 --> 00:54:01,150
Scott: But yeah, the big one, when I was even younger with the taped up windows, took the shed in our front lawn and blew it over the rock wall into the neighbor's yard.

948
00:54:02,211 --> 00:54:05,947
Scott: As well as demolishing another shed in the back and knocking down a tree, right?

949
00:54:07,371 --> 00:54:13,570
Scott: So, you know, and now, you know, I think my parents, they just keep losing trees left and right all the time.

950
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:16,730
Scott: They're down, I think, in recent years, like two or three trees.

951
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:23,229
Rym: What got knocked down around here was every empty lot that has those janky ass, like wooden walls around them, like those wooden fences.

952
00:54:23,991 --> 00:54:26,990
Rym: Every one of those fences was knocked down around every vacant lot in Queens.

953
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:28,070
Scott: Yeah, the plywood wall.

954
00:54:28,191 --> 00:54:33,149
Rym: Yeah, and sure enough, yesterday there were guys not being paid very much, just putting them back up.

955
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:36,350
Scott: There was one downed tree in my neighborhood, right?

956
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:46,110
Rym: There was literally no damage in Long Island City, like where we were, but then if you walked two blocks inland, like toward the river, trees were knocked down everywhere.

957
00:54:47,114 --> 00:54:57,629
Scott: See, the thing with trees that's always weird, right, is like you think this tree's dead, yeah, it's in danger, and usually we get rid of dead trees before they're a problem, but sometimes they fall down because, well, they're dead, right?

958
00:54:58,413 --> 00:55:00,190
Scott: But living trees, why do they fall?

959
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:00,786
Scott: And it's this.

960
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:08,630
Scott: During the summer, when it's not so stormy, tree fucking grows, and the tree can support its own weight just standing there, right?

961
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:14,750
Scott: But maybe this season it's bigger than last season, and it grew in such a way that, yeah, it can stand on its own still.

962
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:15,728
Scott: It's not a stupid tree.

963
00:55:16,171 --> 00:55:26,290
Scott: But because it grew this branch here and that branch there, the weight is now in this different place, and if a storm comes through now or a big snow weighs the branches down now.

964
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:30,170
Rym: Well, that's the key if there's snow before the leaves fall off.

965
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:44,470
Scott: Then, because of the new weight distribution of the increasingly grown tree with its new leaves and branches, especially at this time of year where the tree still has leaves-- No, actually, I read that trees falling, like soil dampness and composition has way more to do with it.

966
00:55:44,610 --> 00:56:00,870
Scott: I was about to get into the added weight on the branches of the new growth shifting, right, the new root increases into new places, and if you've got flooding, the tree's not grabbing onto solid dirt.

967
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:07,050
Scott: It's grabbing onto mud, so if a big wind comes and it's wet, that tree is busy just sitting in mush.

968
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:12,009
Scott: It just goes blorp, falls right over, right, even though the tree is perfectly A-OK.

969
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:16,967
Scott: And in some cases, I sort of wish, you know, they tend to just come with chainsaws and get the trees out of the hell out of there.

970
00:56:17,492 --> 00:56:22,770
Scott: But it's like if the tree fell over because it was sitting in mud, you could sort of stand it back up and let it dry.

971
00:56:23,492 --> 00:56:24,629
Scott: You know, it'll go back.

972
00:56:25,472 --> 00:56:27,490
Rym: So I don't think-- we've gone on long enough.

973
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:29,610
Rym: I mean, we hung out, didn't affect us at all.

974
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:30,530
Rym: We rode the hurricane out.

975
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:32,690
Scott: Well, I said a whole week on hurricane.

976
00:56:33,352 --> 00:56:34,570
Rym: I know, I'm working from home every day.

977
00:56:34,651 --> 00:56:43,729
Rym: I did go to work today, but tomorrow-- The problem is my entire ops team didn't have-- basically, I'm the only person who had reliable internet power--.

978
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:45,750
Scott: Oh, so no one else had power at home or work.

979
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:46,429
Scott: They had no choice.

980
00:56:46,931 --> 00:56:56,530
Rym: Yeah, so I had to cover for my entire ops team instead of doing my actual normal job, which I forgot how much I fucking hate supporting anything.

981
00:56:57,210 --> 00:57:00,870
Rym: I hate-- I hate it when someone's like, "I can't connect to the WhatsApp.

982
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:03,066
Rym: I got to log into, like, a shell and tail a

983
00:57:03,126 --> 00:57:03,530
Rym: log.".

984
00:57:03,651 --> 00:57:05,349
Rym: I hate doing stuff like that.

985
00:57:06,234 --> 00:57:07,530
Rym: So I've been doing that for most of the week.

986
00:57:07,871 --> 00:57:14,147
Rym: But if I were working from home like this doing my actual job, this would perhaps be the best thing ever.

987
00:57:15,111 --> 00:57:17,329
Scott: I talked to a person, and you know what they told me?

988
00:57:17,551 --> 00:57:18,168
Rym: What did they tell you?

989
00:57:18,471 --> 00:57:22,950
Scott: Their work gives them some vacation days and gives them infinite sick days.

990
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:24,189
Rym: Yeah, that's a good way to be.

991
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:28,070
Scott: Their work also gives them a month of telecommuting every year.

992
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:29,189
Scott: So they don't telecommute usually.

993
00:57:29,552 --> 00:57:30,729
Scott: So 11 months out of the year, they go to work.

994
00:57:31,494 --> 00:57:33,589
Rym: We did something like that at my old company, but not a whole month.

995
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:36,050
Scott: One month out of the year, you can telecommute.

996
00:57:36,270 --> 00:57:41,009
Scott: So of course, during your telecommuting month, you just live in some other fucking country.

997
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:44,167
Scott: You don't stay around and keep telecommuting from home.

998
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:52,770
Scott: This person who I talked to one month out of the year just rented for one month an apartment in Paris.

999
00:57:53,197 --> 00:57:53,343
Scott: Ooh.

1000
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:56,050
Scott: Instead of, you know, and telecommuted from there.

1001
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:57,890
Scott: So okay, sure, eight hours of the day.

1002
00:57:58,170 --> 00:57:59,189
Scott: So Scott, I'll tell you what.

1003
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:06,510
Scott: They're sitting in this Parisian apartment working with their computer on the internets, and the rest of the day, they're just living in fucking Paris.

1004
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,269
Scott: I don't know what kind of visa you need for that shit.

1005
00:58:08,411 --> 00:58:09,609
Rym: I will tell you what.

1006
00:58:10,231 --> 00:58:11,947
Rym: If I start a game studio someday...

1007
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:17,089
Scott: I'm asking my work for this kind of scenario because it might fly, small chance.

1008
00:58:18,092 --> 00:58:20,448
Scott: And I'll spend my month in a different place every year.

1009
00:58:21,434 --> 00:58:24,249
Rym: I would spend at least one of them at just some ridiculous beach.

1010
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:32,510
Scott: I will spend all of them at different ridiculous beaches until I have been on every ridiculous beach this earth has to offer when there are no hurricanes coming.

1011
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:35,328
Rym: I'd get a cheap laptop that I would use on the beach and I wouldn't care if I lost it.

1012
00:58:36,151 --> 00:58:37,549
Scott: I don't know what if I'd even do the work.

1013
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:41,387
Rym: Well, see, that's why everyone's so leery about letting people do it.

1014
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:42,309
Scott: At least I'm honest.

1015
00:58:43,795 --> 00:58:48,450
Rym: So because Halloween was yesterday, Scott didn't come, but we had a low-key Halloween.

1016
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:55,469
Rym: We watched a movie that I'm going to not say anything about because we're going to talk about it on a future show.

1017
00:58:55,952 --> 00:58:57,369
Rym: You need to watch the movie first.

1018
00:58:59,272 --> 00:59:01,890
Rym: It's pretty good, but not in the way you'd expect.

1019
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:02,535
Scott: I need to eat.

1020
00:59:02,555 --> 00:59:03,709
Scott: I'm starting to get all ooze.

1021
00:59:05,297 --> 00:59:08,189
Rym: But because it was Halloween, I have an additional thing of the day.

1022
00:59:08,613 --> 00:59:09,289
Scott: No, you're not allowed to.

1023
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:10,448
Rym: So there was a place.

1024
00:59:10,671 --> 00:59:11,370
Scott: Spooky ghost.

1025
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:14,869
Rym: And in that place, there was a storm and the storm knocked over a tree.

1026
00:59:14,991 --> 00:59:17,049
Rym: A tree that was on an ancient graveyard.

1027
00:59:17,191 --> 00:59:19,170
Scott: Are you talking about the skull in the tree?

1028
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:19,551
Rym: Yes.

1029
00:59:19,571 --> 00:59:29,490
Rym: So people going to clear out the tree discovered that inside of the tree, embedded deep in the root system, was an upside-down human skeleton.

1030
00:59:31,532 --> 00:59:34,370
Rym: And all I could think of was Poltergeist, the movie.

1031
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:35,183
Scott: Me?

1032
00:59:36,012 --> 00:59:36,216
Rym: Yeah?

1033
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:36,909
Rym: Remember that movie?

1034
00:59:37,614 --> 00:59:37,927
Scott: Barely.

1035
00:59:38,753 --> 00:59:44,069
Rym: There's the famous line of, it's something like, "You moved the headstones, but you didn't move the bodies.

1036
00:59:44,552 --> 00:59:45,680
Rym: You asshole.

1037
00:59:46,042 --> 00:59:48,360
Rym: You moved the headstones, but you didn't move the

1038
00:59:48,421 --> 00:59:48,926
Rym: bodies.".

1039
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:51,890
Rym: Because the movie ends not with ghosts, but with a storm happening.

1040
00:59:52,270 --> 00:59:54,690
Rym: And then all these bodies start popping up out of the ground.

1041
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:55,609
Rym: And they're just dead bodies.

1042
00:59:56,992 --> 01:00:01,450
Scott: Isn't a poltergeist an invisible thing that messes shit up in your house, knocking things over?

1043
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:05,390
Rym: A poltergeist is a teenager, according to mystical people.

1044
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:10,470
Scott: A poltergeist is supposed to be this invisible thing that you're walking around your house and knocks a chair over.

1045
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:10,751
Scott: Yes.

1046
01:00:11,032 --> 01:00:23,889
Rym: So, pseudo-Randy, woo-woo, shitty people tend to believe nowadays that poltergeists are caused by young people going through puberty with extreme emotions who have latent psychic powers.

1047
01:00:25,072 --> 01:00:25,626
Scott: Alrighty then.

1048
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,520
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
