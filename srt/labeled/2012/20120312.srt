1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,469
Rym: It's Monday, March 12th, 2012.

2
00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:12,930
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:13,773
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,873 --> 00:00:17,542
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight, Network Mounted Storage.

5
00:00:19,706 --> 00:00:20,788
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:20,808 --> 00:00:27,078
Rym: Oh my gosh, we're back.

7
00:00:27,258 --> 00:00:28,601
Rym: I feel like it wasn't that long ago.

8
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:30,790
Rym: we did a We're Back show, but we're back again.

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:31,452
Rym: Yep.

10
00:00:31,894 --> 00:00:33,119
Rym: Yep, I was in India.

11
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:36,151
Scott: And we're gonna be away again once PAX East shows up in a few weeks.

12
00:00:36,473 --> 00:00:39,225
Rym: Yep, but PAX East is not most of the normal week.

13
00:00:39,265 --> 00:00:40,732
Rym: I mean, we'll be back Monday.

14
00:00:40,753 --> 00:00:42,160
Rym: We could still do a show, I guess.

15
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:42,702
Scott: Maybe.

16
00:00:42,722 --> 00:00:47,197
Scott: I was at the Duane Reade today and I saw some Easter candy and I was like, "Oh my god,

17
00:00:47,538 --> 00:00:47,839
Scott: PAX.".

18
00:00:50,201 --> 00:00:50,883
Rym: So, unrelatedly...

19
00:00:50,923 --> 00:00:51,825
Scott: I bought one egg.

20
00:00:51,845 --> 00:00:52,728
Scott: It was 89 cents.

21
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:56,538
Rym: One of my co-workers is like, "Hey, you wanna try some

22
00:00:56,779 --> 00:00:57,240
Rym: candy?".

23
00:00:57,481 --> 00:01:01,131
Rym: And I'm like, "What do you have that is going to surprise

24
00:01:01,171 --> 00:01:01,291
Rym: me?".

25
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:01,452
Rym: "Turkish

26
00:01:01,993 --> 00:01:02,154
Rym: Pever?".

27
00:01:02,194 --> 00:01:03,818
Rym: He busted out some Salmiakki.

28
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:06,045
Rym: and I'm like, "Let me tell you about Salmiakki,

29
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:06,366
Rym: son.".

30
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:07,851
Scott: I've had that shit.

31
00:01:08,594 --> 00:01:09,457
Rym: Oh, Turkish Pever.

32
00:01:09,638 --> 00:01:10,280
Rym: But PAX is coming.

33
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,284
Scott: Which kind did he have?

34
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:12,188
Rym: He had the normal.

35
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:13,434
Rym: The same kind that we get.

36
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,840
Scott: Oh, you didn't have the racing wheel?

37
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,197
Rym: No, I was like, "So you haven't had Dragster or whatever or Death's Head or Turkish

38
00:01:19,258 --> 00:01:19,559
Rym: Pever.".

39
00:01:20,523 --> 00:01:22,049
Scott: Was he shocked that you knew what this was?

40
00:01:22,069 --> 00:01:24,579
Rym: Not really, 'cause I have a reputation for...

41
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,134
Scott: Now they've gotten used to the fact that we are on the internet.

42
00:01:27,175 --> 00:01:28,060
Scott: We're worldly people.

43
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,803
Scott: We know things.

44
00:01:29,124 --> 00:01:32,579
Scott: You can't surprise me with some secret candy from a foreign land.

45
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:36,476
Rym: This guy is one of the smart, young, and cool developers who is going to be at PAX.

46
00:01:36,576 --> 00:01:40,732
Rym: And in fact, his girlfriend is making their costumes because they are cosplaying.

47
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:41,435
Scott: As what?

48
00:01:42,158 --> 00:01:43,844
Rym: I think Megaman and Rock or something.

49
00:01:43,864 --> 00:01:44,366
Rym: Not bad.

50
00:01:44,627 --> 00:01:45,329
Rym: I forget.

51
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,213
Rym: Megaman and Roll?

52
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:46,634
Rym: Something.

53
00:01:47,477 --> 00:01:48,200
Scott: Rike is Megaman.

54
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:53,810
Rym: I said Megaman, but I should have said Rock and Roll, but not everyone would know what that is, 'cause this is Monday and not Tuesday.

55
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,493
Scott: I know what that is.

56
00:01:54,775 --> 00:01:59,900
Rym: But anyway, I was in India, and we will do a show at some point on a Thursday about my experiences in India.

57
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,563
Rym: It was awesome.

58
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:03,273
Scott: And you'll try to cut back on the racist stereotypes.

59
00:02:03,675 --> 00:02:05,843
Rym: Indian food, pretty great in India.

60
00:02:06,465 --> 00:02:08,392
Rym: Drinking water, not so great in India.

61
00:02:08,413 --> 00:02:09,095
Rym: No kidding.

62
00:02:09,356 --> 00:02:14,778
Rym: But the biggest thing I have to say, and I say this every time I leave the country, I was in India.

63
00:02:14,798 --> 00:02:16,706
Rym: In fact, I was in Mumbai and Hyderabad.

64
00:02:16,746 --> 00:02:22,006
Rym: Mumbai was not that long ago wracked with pretty serious recent terrorist attacks.

65
00:02:22,607 --> 00:02:29,243
Rym: This is a city and a nation that has a real problem with actual terrorist attacks.

66
00:02:30,086 --> 00:02:39,171
Rym: So when I got on a plane to fly from Mumbai, where terrorist attacks just happened, to Hyderabad, I go to the airport.

67
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:41,657
Rym: I did not have to take off my shoes.

68
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:45,549
Rym: I did not have to go through a body scanner or get groped.

69
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:54,117
Rym: The security line from start to "I can get on the plane" took less than a minute and a half.

70
00:02:54,177 --> 00:02:54,679
Rym: So you know what?

71
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:55,101
Scott: What did they do?

72
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:56,247
Scott: You just walked through a metal detector?

73
00:02:56,287 --> 00:02:57,373
Rym: I walked through a metal detector.

74
00:02:57,855 --> 00:02:58,378
Rym: It beeped.

75
00:02:59,061 --> 00:02:59,925
Rym: And you know what the guy did?

76
00:02:59,965 --> 00:03:00,347
Rym: He said, "Come

77
00:03:00,428 --> 00:03:00,629
Rym: here.".

78
00:03:01,051 --> 00:03:05,029
Rym: He waved a metal detector, a hand one, over me for like two seconds.

79
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:08,001
Scott: You mean what they used to do in the year 2000 in the United States?

80
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:08,564
Scott: He found the beep.

81
00:03:09,247 --> 00:03:11,096
Rym: The beep was my cell phone in my pocket.

82
00:03:11,297 --> 00:03:12,844
Scott: That you should have taken out.

83
00:03:12,884 --> 00:03:13,848
Rym: No, they didn't care.

84
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:25,816
Rym: He touched it from the outside, touched his big lump, used his human skills to determine that it was probably a cell phone and not in fact a gun, did not even ask me to take it out of my pocket.

85
00:03:25,896 --> 00:03:27,141
Scott: Was there an x-ray for your goods?

86
00:03:27,382 --> 00:03:28,849
Rym: Yes, my bag went through an x-ray.

87
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,420
Rym: Did not have to take my laptop out of my bag.

88
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:42,170
Rym: My bag in fact included a giant lithium ion battery, a bigger lithium ion battery, a Kindle, a DS, a laptop, and a laptop charger.

89
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,193
Scott: A bunch of bombs.

90
00:03:43,634 --> 00:03:46,986
Rym: And the x-ray guy looked at it and I saw what his screen looks like.

91
00:03:47,006 --> 00:03:48,915
Scott: A bunch of colors on a white background.

92
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:55,105
Rym: The guy looked at it, he paused on my bag, kind of like looked at the screen for a few seconds, and then waved it through.

93
00:03:55,165 --> 00:03:56,373
Scott: So he was actually doing his job.

94
00:03:56,413 --> 00:03:56,756
Rym: He was.

95
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:57,118
Rym: You know what?

96
00:03:57,138 --> 00:03:57,925
Scott: Otherwise he wouldn't have stopped.

97
00:03:57,945 --> 00:03:58,953
Scott: You know what the moral of all this is?

98
00:03:58,974 --> 00:04:02,150
Scott: If I had that job I'd just hold the button down and be like, fall asleep.

99
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,420
Rym: You know what the moral of this is?

100
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,152
Rym: Fuck you TSA, I'm sick of your motherfucking bullshit.

101
00:04:08,172 --> 00:04:09,216
Scott: That's not a new moral.

102
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:16,245
Rym: Seriously, countries with real terrorists do not go through the level of inane security theater bullshit that you make me go through.

103
00:04:16,265 --> 00:04:16,928
Scott: This isn't news.

104
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,274
Rym: I'm not saying it's news.

105
00:04:18,415 --> 00:04:20,524
Rym: I'm just, every time I leave America.

106
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:21,829
Scott: It's 10 years old, this news.

107
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:23,715
Rym: It only pisses me off more.

108
00:04:23,735 --> 00:04:27,046
Rym: I cannot deal with the TSA.

109
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,874
Rym: And in fact, the international flight back home, right?

110
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,100
Rym: Security, even less.

111
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:34,463
Rym: Even less.

112
00:04:35,305 --> 00:04:39,317
Rym: So that security aside, I got through security, right?

113
00:04:39,357 --> 00:04:45,803
Rym: And then in the airport because it was a flight going to the United States and the United States doesn't trust anyone else's security.

114
00:04:46,445 --> 00:04:55,320
Rym: We all had to go through security again at the terminal where there they had TSA signs up and they had like the three one one rule and all that stuff.

115
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:55,862
Rym: And you know what?

116
00:04:56,746 --> 00:04:59,317
Rym: They actually just did the exact same thing they did before.

117
00:04:59,337 --> 00:05:01,023
Rym: They didn't do anything different.

118
00:05:02,148 --> 00:05:06,123
Rym: They just went through the motions to satisfy the TSA and the paranoid us bullshit.

119
00:05:06,143 --> 00:05:09,456
Rym: But I just have to say it every time I leave the country.

120
00:05:09,536 --> 00:05:09,978
Rym: Fuck you.

121
00:05:09,998 --> 00:05:11,322
Rym: I hate the TSA.

122
00:05:11,723 --> 00:05:12,706
Scott: They'll be gone.

123
00:05:12,967 --> 00:05:13,388
Rym: Will they?

124
00:05:13,408 --> 00:05:15,093
Scott: This is pushing backs.

125
00:05:15,675 --> 00:05:17,841
Rym: So that's why I get to my news.

126
00:05:17,962 --> 00:05:19,125
Rym: because great.

127
00:05:19,205 --> 00:05:20,910
Scott: At least it's going to be more of the same.

128
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:25,884
Rym: Arguably the problem with the TSA.

129
00:05:26,185 --> 00:05:32,913
Rym: At least they say, all right, they can justify the body scanners that they will catch things that maybe metal detectors wouldn't catch.

130
00:05:32,973 --> 00:05:33,516
Scott: No, they can't.

131
00:05:33,757 --> 00:05:38,242
Rym: But every news story I see talks about how all the things they catch or things that the metal detectors call.

132
00:05:38,262 --> 00:05:40,073
Scott: We've known that they're bullshit for a long time.

133
00:05:40,093 --> 00:05:43,369
Rym: They knew they were bullshit because they didn't catch anything you wouldn't already catch.

134
00:05:44,072 --> 00:05:47,789
Rym: But it turns out they can't even catch the stuff they're supposed to catch.

135
00:05:47,809 --> 00:05:49,136
Rym: The metal detectors can't catch.

136
00:05:49,618 --> 00:06:01,128
Rym: And this guy showed that not only are they useless security theater bullshit, but it is trivial to trick them into not seeing the things that they're supposed to be able to catch.

137
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:13,595
Rym: All So at this point, I've decided that it's not even political maneuvering.

138
00:06:14,157 --> 00:06:18,212
Rym: It's not even security theater to keep the mouth breathers happy or whatever.

139
00:06:18,855 --> 00:06:20,240
Rym: It is straight up corruption.

140
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:25,262
Rym: The people who make the scanners had corruption happen to get them in the airports and to suppress.

141
00:06:25,624 --> 00:06:25,905
Scott: I don't know.

142
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,512
Scott: Are you just discovering this now?

143
00:06:27,693 --> 00:06:28,798
Rym: No, I'm just now.

144
00:06:28,838 --> 00:06:29,561
Rym: I'm confirming it.

145
00:06:29,641 --> 00:06:30,907
Rym: It goes from confirming.

146
00:06:30,927 --> 00:06:31,650
Scott: It's like the 10th.

147
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:32,293
Scott: All right.

148
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,780
Scott: Now we've got 30 confirmations.

149
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,268
Scott: That's enough confirmations, guys.

150
00:06:35,348 --> 00:06:42,155
Scott: Because now we know for sure, for sure, for sure, this is the first time someone basically completely broke them.

151
00:06:42,195 --> 00:06:44,142
Rym: This is like all the way over the edge.

152
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:52,200
Scott: I don't know if you saw the German video that was multiple years ago on the show where the guy walked through the scanners and then pulled all this shit out of his pockets.

153
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,787
Rym: Yeah, but this guy did it.

154
00:06:53,827 --> 00:06:54,832
Scott: How is this different?

155
00:06:55,234 --> 00:06:56,239
Rym: This one actually was different.

156
00:06:56,259 --> 00:06:59,171
Rym: You should read the article about specifically the vulnerability he found.

157
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:01,983
Rym: Yeah, I saw his response, which was interesting.

158
00:07:02,003 --> 00:07:03,107
Rym: They said, don't report on that.

159
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:03,730
Scott: Yeah.

160
00:07:04,694 --> 00:07:12,586
Rym: Now, if it's so trivial to break them, I cannot help but think that if there were any matter of QA testing, they would have found these vulnerabilities.

161
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:21,118
Rym: So either they were suppressed because someone had a vested money interest or everybody in the world isn't confident.

162
00:07:21,198 --> 00:07:22,824
Scott: It's like you're saying like the shock thing.

163
00:07:22,864 --> 00:07:23,889
Scott: It's like, oh my God, Rym.

164
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:24,792
Scott: Oh my God.

165
00:07:24,993 --> 00:07:26,660
Scott: I didn't say cause cancer.

166
00:07:26,841 --> 00:07:27,543
Scott: It's I know.

167
00:07:27,563 --> 00:07:29,208
Scott: I didn't even say it was news.

168
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:34,929
Rym: All I'm saying is that the mountain of evidence, there's such a mountain of evidence now.

169
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,175
Scott: It's it's it's concrete.

170
00:07:36,195 --> 00:07:38,405
Scott: There was definitely corruption in the tobacco industry.

171
00:07:38,987 --> 00:07:39,851
Scott: It's set in stone.

172
00:07:40,152 --> 00:07:41,136
Scott: Have you seen this story?

173
00:07:41,317 --> 00:07:42,523
Scott: This dude died of lung cancer.

174
00:07:42,543 --> 00:07:43,407
Scott: He smoked his whole life.

175
00:07:43,488 --> 00:07:48,534
Rym: Every time I leave the country and I come back and I run into this shit, I just have to take my pile of bullshit.

176
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:49,237
Rym: I left.

177
00:07:49,317 --> 00:07:49,800
Rym: I came back.

178
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,368
Rym: I have a new pile of bullshit.

179
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:51,972
Rym: I got to dump it.

180
00:07:51,992 --> 00:07:54,024
Scott: So every time I walk down the street, there's a guy smoking.

181
00:07:54,044 --> 00:07:56,599
Scott: I just got to take that pile of bullshit and dump it out again.

182
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,121
Rym: Yep.

183
00:07:57,563 --> 00:07:58,487
Rym: Scott, where am I going to put it?

184
00:07:58,567 --> 00:08:02,426
Rym: I mean, my bullshit landfill is full, so I got to dump it on the Internet.

185
00:08:02,466 --> 00:08:03,954
Rym: I got to put it in your cigarette.

186
00:08:03,994 --> 00:08:05,100
Scott: But landfill is full.

187
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:05,562
Scott: Yeah.

188
00:08:05,622 --> 00:08:08,633
Rym: So I'm dumping it in all of your brains to get it out of my brain.

189
00:08:09,938 --> 00:08:26,433
Rym: It's an interesting article, though, mostly because we're getting to the point where at least when bullshit like this happens, any average dude can pretty much because, you know, it's easy to verifiably break stuff like this, publicly break it and just wave it in their faces.

190
00:08:26,453 --> 00:08:28,320
Rym: All right.

191
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,528
Scott: So here is some local news.

192
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:31,170
Rym: Oh.

193
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,214
Scott: New York City news.

194
00:08:32,414 --> 00:08:32,616
Scott: Right.

195
00:08:32,676 --> 00:08:34,423
Scott: That is actually the opposite of corruption.

196
00:08:34,443 --> 00:08:35,246
Scott: Uh huh.

197
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:52,742
Scott: You may have known previously that, you know, New York City has had various, you know, initiatives were like they wanted people to make New York City apps and they would open various New York City data in, you know, good and maybe not as good, but still open ways to get people to make apps, you know, especially MTA type stuff, things like that.

198
00:08:53,203 --> 00:08:53,444
Scott: Right.

199
00:08:54,187 --> 00:08:55,070
Scott: There is a new law.

200
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:58,040
Scott: It is a law, not a bill or anything like that.

201
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,643
Scott: Bloomberg signed it.

202
00:08:59,824 --> 00:09:02,955
Scott: It is number twenty nine a blah, blah, blah.

203
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:10,302
Scott: It basically says, yeah, all public domain data in New York City is has to be open and available on the Internet for free.

204
00:09:10,824 --> 00:09:16,001
Scott: And by twenty eighteen, not only will it be available, it will also be in one place.

205
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:23,549
Scott: They'll be like one New York City data website that will have all the New York City data that is public in one spot.

206
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:27,003
Scott: And you can just get at it and make all sorts of crazy apps and shit.

207
00:09:27,244 --> 00:09:28,388
Rym: Interesting.

208
00:09:28,489 --> 00:09:29,051
Scott: I like that.

209
00:09:29,272 --> 00:09:31,160
Scott: And so it won't just be like subway schedule.

210
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,360
Scott: I guess it'll also be like plowing routes.

211
00:09:34,961 --> 00:09:36,760
Scott: And who can imagine all kinds of crazy shit?

212
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:42,857
Scott: What's in stock at the library schedule of when the sewers are going to get?

213
00:09:42,877 --> 00:09:54,579
Rym: I look forward to like the craziest, most intrusive use of this information to figure out how much traffic goes through the tunnels every day, where the street fair is going to be.

214
00:09:55,541 --> 00:10:01,308
Scott: You know, this weekend, I can't even like I'm trying to imagine all the crazy data that's out there.

215
00:10:01,532 --> 00:10:01,920
Rym: Oh, my God.

216
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,480
Rym: The street fair thing would be great because I could use street fair.

217
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,300
Scott: There is a ghetto static HTML website that tells you where the street fair is going to be.

218
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:23,080
Rym: I know, but I've decided, you know, I've realized kind of fundamentally on the Internet that in the early days, pull information like that was all I needed, because if I care about X, I will do a pull on X and get X. But now there's so much information available that I could conceivably use.

219
00:10:23,685 --> 00:10:25,279
Rym: It is not worth my time to pull it.

220
00:10:26,141 --> 00:10:28,319
Rym: So I need an aggregated puller.

221
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,979
Rym: The problem is the data isn't all these like difficult to access.

222
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,327
Rym: Every format is different.

223
00:10:33,408 --> 00:10:35,080
Rym: One off cases to where it's not worth my effort.

224
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,640
Scott: Is what I have t t t t t t t t is great.

225
00:10:38,001 --> 00:10:42,320
Rym: Yeah, except it doesn't support G, plus, which is the thing I actually really want.

226
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:48,241
Rym: Plus doesn't have an API, which is the biggest thing holding me back from really using G plus.

227
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,089
Scott: I just set it up to where.

228
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:53,665
Scott: now Twitter, Facebook, G plus are all sort of linked up as much as possible.

229
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,800
Scott: So I don't really care which one it is like.

230
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,240
Scott: I'll open up any one of the three and I'm fine, whatever.

231
00:10:58,701 --> 00:10:59,405
Scott: I don't care anymore.

232
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:03,657
Rym: I really in general, though, cut down on kind of my inbound and outbound data streams.

233
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:12,100
Scott: I had a huge cutting down of the reading too many websites and I did a little bit up on the, you know, social bits.

234
00:11:12,401 --> 00:11:19,500
Scott: But the reason I up the social bits is because I unfollowed the fuck out of it and unfriended a zillion people.

235
00:11:19,621 --> 00:11:24,259
Scott: So now it's like you go to Twitter and I can go there twice a day and read a bunch of tweets and tweet a bunch.

236
00:11:24,842 --> 00:11:27,155
Scott: But I'm only following like 70 people instead of 170 people.

237
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,554
Rym: So it's like, wow, I'm only following 73 people now.

238
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,240
Rym: And that was before I did an unfollow.

239
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:33,663
Scott: Yeah.

240
00:11:33,703 --> 00:11:35,340
Scott: Let me go see how many I'm like.

241
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,867
Scott: I unfollowed like all the people.

242
00:11:38,148 --> 00:11:43,760
Rym: I have long had a policy of never, ever reciprocating follows or friends or anything.

243
00:11:44,081 --> 00:11:49,259
Rym: In fact, on YouTube, I refuse to even engage in the social side because I'm following one hundred and eighteen people.

244
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,224
Scott: That's more than I thought.

245
00:11:50,687 --> 00:11:53,383
Rym: All hundred eighteen of those people have interesting tweets that you want to know.

246
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:58,300
Scott: Actually, the thing is most of those people don't even don't even like tweet that often.

247
00:11:58,381 --> 00:12:00,379
Scott: So I'll never even see a tweet from them.

248
00:12:01,161 --> 00:12:03,495
Scott: There's only a very small number of them that actually tweet.

249
00:12:04,661 --> 00:12:04,862
Scott: Yeah.

250
00:12:05,063 --> 00:12:11,940
Rym: Anyway, so one last little bit of news, because a long time ago, you know, Google cars and the Google self-driving thing has been going along for a long time.

251
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:18,660
Rym: And, you know, we made a big deal about how Nevada was finally going to allow driverless cars and automated cars with restrictions.

252
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,020
Rym: You know, this stuff has to be regulated.

253
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,420
Rym: It's a it's a brand new industry that's slowly going to come on board.

254
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:25,344
Rym: Big leaps are happening.

255
00:12:25,364 --> 00:12:29,902
Rym: California is now actually has pending legislation that will do the same thing.

256
00:12:29,922 --> 00:12:44,299
Rym: This is actually a huge deal because California is a place where there's enough of a market to where Google could probably start selling these cars to actual rich people who will use them in real life situations.

257
00:12:45,043 --> 00:12:49,520
Scott: I can't wait until the law is, yeah, people can't be trusted to drive the air.

258
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,642
Scott: People get into accidents this rate of the time and the automatic cars get accidents at this rate.

259
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:57,600
Scott: So you're not allowed to drive, period, unless it's a track.

260
00:12:57,721 --> 00:13:00,900
Scott: And oh, by the way, all the city bus drivers try to work.

261
00:13:01,241 --> 00:13:05,980
Rym: What's amazing to me is that a lot of the comments on this article are people who are saying, but they're not safe.

262
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:08,180
Rym: I would never trust a computer to drive me around.

263
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,129
Rym: It's like really slash dot.

264
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:10,058
Rym: This is what you've become.

265
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:10,662
Rym: Yeah.

266
00:13:10,682 --> 00:13:11,568
Scott: The old man.

267
00:13:11,729 --> 00:13:13,340
Scott: They're safer than you driving.

268
00:13:14,402 --> 00:13:20,060
Rym: I well, I don't you know, people make the argument that, you know, they have to be perfectly safe or we can't trust them.

269
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:24,905
Scott: No, they just have to be safer than human drivers, which is a pretty low bar on average.

270
00:13:24,966 --> 00:13:25,167
Scott: Yeah.

271
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:26,540
Scott: Or we can do the thing.

272
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,080
Scott: You know, there are probably human drivers who are safer than the computer driver.

273
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,887
Scott: They probably exist.

274
00:13:31,008 --> 00:13:32,300
Scott: Michael Schumacher is probably going to drive.

275
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:41,904
Rym: Maybe the rules should be should be if you are a human driver who cannot get above a certain right in the test, the driving you have to use an automated car or you can't drive.

276
00:13:41,924 --> 00:13:43,540
Scott: the driving test will be hard as balls.

277
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:44,745
Scott: But here's the thing.

278
00:13:44,805 --> 00:13:45,006
Scott: Right.

279
00:13:45,086 --> 00:13:48,462
Scott: So let's say you are we already did a show on this sort of.

280
00:13:48,724 --> 00:13:48,945
Rym: Yeah.

281
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,240
Scott: You're a low skilled human driver.

282
00:13:51,362 --> 00:13:52,499
Scott: You have an automated car.

283
00:13:52,863 --> 00:13:53,125
Scott: Right.

284
00:13:53,247 --> 00:13:53,772
Scott: It does.

285
00:13:53,812 --> 00:13:54,540
Scott: You're sitting there.

286
00:13:54,741 --> 00:13:56,998
Scott: It does malfunction legitimately.

287
00:13:57,961 --> 00:14:01,020
Rym: All you have to do is slam on the brakes and avoid obstacles.

288
00:14:01,764 --> 00:14:03,040
Rym: Yeah, I think everyone can do that.

289
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,346
Scott: I'm just saying, right.

290
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:04,748
Scott: It's like.

291
00:14:04,768 --> 00:14:05,150
Scott: you've never.

292
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,160
Scott: even you don't even know how to drive.

293
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,399
Scott: You've never driven because you don't need to.

294
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,357
Scott: You have automatic cars.

295
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:11,468
Rym: Well, the law is that.

296
00:14:11,609 --> 00:14:12,073
Scott: is that anime?

297
00:14:13,181 --> 00:14:14,038
Scott: What was the anime called?

298
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,028
Scott: Our driver is something.

299
00:14:16,935 --> 00:14:17,540
Rym: it was shitty.

300
00:14:17,842 --> 00:14:18,328
Scott: It was.

301
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,220
Rym: it looked really good.

302
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,190
Rym: I thought it was going to be good.

303
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,120
Rym: It was terrible anyway.

304
00:14:21,841 --> 00:14:30,378
Rym: But the law still states that a driver has to be in the vehicle, capable and ready, capable of and ready to take control of the car.

305
00:14:31,022 --> 00:14:34,760
Rym: So you still can't drive drunk or, you know, talking on your cell phone or whatever.

306
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:52,460
Rym: But the reason I bring this up, that is noteworthy, is that our government, as slow as it is, is actually for the first time, maybe in the last hundred years, making legislation before we come to a critical like crisis point of technology.

307
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,760
Scott: Well, because it's something that the government can more easily understand.

308
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:03,720
Rym: I think it's more because this is the one area where Google is putting its money into the political arena that also think about it.

309
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,839
Rym: Google, with its crazy amounts of money, enough money to buy the entire U.S.

310
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:13,769
Rym: recording industry if they want it, puts a pinky toe into politics and suddenly gets exactly what it wants.

311
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:14,840
Rym: Interesting.

312
00:15:16,481 --> 00:15:20,500
Rym: But the fact that it's California means that this is the next big step.

313
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:29,580
Rym: And I really think we're going to see a few rich people buying automated Google cars in the next five years and using them on a day to day basis.

314
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,340
Rym: And I think that is going to be a huge tipping point for the technology.

315
00:15:34,481 --> 00:15:39,759
Rym: I now will argue that within in my lifetime, I know this is an easy argument to make.

316
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:48,668
Rym: Scott's prediction will come true and we will have a shift toward humans can't drive at all unless they pass some specialized like.

317
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,972
Rym: I'm a car engineer.

318
00:15:50,013 --> 00:15:53,252
Rym: test like car pilot will be a rare thing.

319
00:15:53,658 --> 00:15:53,820
Scott: Yeah.

320
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,340
Scott: And you'll respect, you know, that's the other thing I understand, right?

321
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,120
Scott: Cars is so much more dangerous, right?

322
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:04,340
Scott: You know, even today you have this level of respect for the captain of a ship and the captain of a plane, right?

323
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:09,040
Scott: Because they're transporting you in a vehicle and your life is in their hands.

324
00:16:09,221 --> 00:16:09,383
Scott: Right.

325
00:16:09,725 --> 00:16:11,680
Scott: But there's no respect for the training.

326
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,359
Scott: There's a little respect for the train engineer, but there should be more.

327
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:18,300
Scott: And I guess there's some respect for the conductor, but he ain't driving right.

328
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:27,620
Scott: There should be more as much respect as there is for the ship captain and the plane captain, for the bus driver, the train engineer and the car driver.

329
00:16:28,102 --> 00:16:36,780
Scott: And if you do not command that level of respect, right, because of your skills and operating this dangerous transportation thing, you shouldn't be driving.

330
00:16:37,101 --> 00:16:46,699
Rym: Now, the trouble is that pragmatically, you know, I don't know anyone else in the car, but pragmatically, the United States is a place where without a car, you're pretty much fucked unless you live in New York.

331
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,149
Scott: Then let's just I'm the.

332
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:49,720
Scott: I'm a terror of the bandaid kind of guy.

333
00:16:50,063 --> 00:16:51,480
Scott: You know, no pain, no gain.

334
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,639
Scott: I think we should just suffer greatly all at once.

335
00:16:54,201 --> 00:16:58,519
Scott: And then that suffering will force us to fix the real problem, except probably won't.

336
00:16:58,901 --> 00:17:03,555
Rym: And it would be to, you know, you realize how much we rely on cars.

337
00:17:04,297 --> 00:17:09,740
Rym: shipping in the nation would probably grind to a halt, which means people would fix it real quick.

338
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,627
Rym: No, they wouldn't be like.

339
00:17:10,748 --> 00:17:11,878
Rym: it's not an easy thing to fix.

340
00:17:12,221 --> 00:17:12,683
Rym: It's not.

341
00:17:13,244 --> 00:17:17,939
Scott: a lot of people just don't have the skills to be surprised when people are desperate, how quickly they will fix.

342
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,202
Scott: Right.

343
00:17:18,222 --> 00:17:19,839
Scott: Like the how many students.

344
00:17:20,223 --> 00:17:20,366
Scott: Right.

345
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,319
Scott: This is how America works.

346
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,145
Scott: This mentality.

347
00:17:22,648 --> 00:17:24,079
Scott: You wait until the last minute.

348
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,319
Scott: The deadline shit's about to hit the fan and then you get it done the last minute.

349
00:17:27,461 --> 00:17:29,613
Scott: The thing is, we've got things set up to where.

350
00:17:29,634 --> 00:17:30,740
Scott: there never is the deadline.

351
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,845
Scott: There never is the last minute.

352
00:17:31,865 --> 00:17:35,189
Scott: So it's just like we got to make it to where like now is the time.

353
00:17:35,209 --> 00:17:35,860
Scott: you're fucked.

354
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,360
Scott: If you don't fix it by the end of the week, you're screwed.

355
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,480
Scott: People will fix it by the end of the week, the same way they would because same way they write the paper one hour before the cut.

356
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:49,343
Rym: My experience has been that good driving is not something that most people are capable of quickly.

357
00:17:49,363 --> 00:17:51,339
Scott: Oh, I don't think they'll solve it by good driving.

358
00:17:52,402 --> 00:17:54,599
Rym: So what are they going to solve it by trains?

359
00:17:55,662 --> 00:17:58,019
Rym: Scott, it takes years to build a new train network.

360
00:17:58,942 --> 00:17:59,304
Scott: Yeah.

361
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:03,271
Scott: Well, when people need the train to get to work, they'll fucking knock down people's houses real.

362
00:18:03,352 --> 00:18:03,959
Scott: They won't.

363
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,683
Scott: Yes, they will.

364
00:18:04,723 --> 00:18:17,300
Rym: Pragmatically, the Google car is actually a good solution because trains only make sense in very high population density areas and between geographically similar high population density.

365
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,059
Scott: Also, people will fucking move to where trains are now.

366
00:18:20,341 --> 00:18:20,763
Rym: They won't.

367
00:18:20,823 --> 00:18:21,829
Rym: That's it's not.

368
00:18:22,071 --> 00:18:23,720
Rym: moving is not something people can do quickly.

369
00:18:24,082 --> 00:18:34,463
Rym: You greatly overestimate people's ability when they're forced to know they won't because it's actually there are kind of non fungible problems that they can't overcome that quickly.

370
00:18:34,544 --> 00:18:36,339
Scott: Then maybe you'll be they'll stay there and die.

371
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,440
Scott: And then people will only be living where the trains are.

372
00:18:38,821 --> 00:18:39,083
Rym: Yeah.

373
00:18:39,144 --> 00:18:41,240
Rym: This is why I take the pragmatic approach.

374
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:41,962
Scott: Not a bad idea.

375
00:18:42,244 --> 00:18:48,520
Rym: Cars, you know, it's kind of like, you know, trains are more like token ring in certain specialized areas.

376
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,420
Rym: They're much better because they're extremely ring is not better for anything.

377
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:57,543
Scott: It is in the sense that no one uses token or anything these days, except for an old token that still exists.

378
00:18:57,563 --> 00:19:02,103
Scott: Manufacturing still uses token bus, a brand new token ring, but no one would make.

379
00:19:02,668 --> 00:19:03,980
Rym: a token bus is still used.

380
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,099
Rym: And you don't want to know why in a brand new factory.

381
00:19:06,701 --> 00:19:16,820
Rym: Scott, the reason they use things like token buses is because while they may have high latency and low bandwidth, they have perfectly reliable latency.

382
00:19:17,121 --> 00:19:18,099
Scott: There's no such thing as jitter.

383
00:19:18,301 --> 00:19:23,120
Scott: But there are plenty of other alternatives that also have the same reliability.

384
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,523
Rym: Like what?

385
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:28,883
Scott: You can use like the CAN bus or various other buses that are not the token bus.

386
00:19:29,508 --> 00:19:30,817
Rym: Scott, token, do you even know what?

387
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:31,220
Rym: token buses?

388
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,619
Rym: It's not the same as token ring.

389
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,582
Scott: I'm just saying.

390
00:19:34,184 --> 00:19:54,500
Rym: And anyway, that aside, the token ring analogy is that it is a. it is a purpose built like it was a deterministic system as opposed to the early Ethernet, which in a place where population is distributed and work and life and home and all these things are distributed in a semi randomized fashion.

391
00:19:55,381 --> 00:20:02,560
Rym: You can't have a train that goes to those places in an efficient manner, but you can have very small packets, which cars that go.

392
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,560
Rym: The problem with cars is that by and large, people are shitty drive.

393
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:10,664
Scott: Well, you shouldn't have built the houses like that in the first place, thus requiring the cars.

394
00:20:10,684 --> 00:20:12,900
Scott: You would have built the houses all close to each other to begin with.

395
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,905
Scott: You wouldn't have this problem.

396
00:20:13,945 --> 00:20:21,762
Rym: But even New York, other than certain high traffic times, taking a cab pretty much anywhere in the city is still faster than taking mass transit.

397
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,899
Scott: Yeah, but it's not faster if everyone did that.

398
00:20:24,341 --> 00:20:24,844
Rym: Exactly.

399
00:20:24,884 --> 00:20:27,540
Scott: And if everyone took the train, then it'd be even better because then.

400
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:36,880
Rym: But the reality is we have this existing infrastructure that even if we make strides to get rid of it over time, we can't just immediately transplant millions of people.

401
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,064
Scott: Free bicycles for everybody.

402
00:20:38,585 --> 00:20:44,400
Rym: Yeah, no cars on the road rather than building trains everywhere, because that's a crazy solution.

403
00:20:44,721 --> 00:20:54,450
Rym: You build trains where trains make sense and you use this sort of packet switch cars driven by computers model, you know, computerized buses that take place every car with a computer car.

404
00:20:54,794 --> 00:20:55,339
Rym: It takes time.

405
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,725
Scott: That's boring.

406
00:20:57,249 --> 00:20:59,160
Rym: Yeah, but it's pragmatic and it works.

407
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,846
Scott: Yeah, but it means that by the time nothing's going to be solved, even when we're dead, because it'll take so long.

408
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,080
Rym: But one big problem will be solved.

409
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,332
Rym: By the time I'm old, I can still get around no matter where I live because I'll have the Google car.

410
00:21:11,557 --> 00:21:11,740
Scott: Sure.

411
00:21:13,401 --> 00:21:16,480
Scott: So Xdriver, there was an OAV that was six episodes.

412
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,524
Rym: The show was terrible.

413
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:20,800
Scott: There was an XD Danger Zone OAV that was one episode.

414
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,825
Rym: That show tricked us.

415
00:21:21,926 --> 00:21:23,676
Scott: There was a movie that was 62 minutes long.

416
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,044
Scott: That was one movie.

417
00:21:25,064 --> 00:21:29,039
Rym: The Oh my God, this guy did the character designs and it looked beautiful and it was about cars.

418
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:30,526
Rym: It was just stupid.

419
00:21:30,586 --> 00:21:33,239
Scott: And there was a manga, but I can't figure how many volumes it was.

420
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:43,740
Rym: Anyway, but anyway, things of the day.

421
00:21:43,921 --> 00:21:44,656
Rym: What do you got for me?

422
00:21:46,421 --> 00:21:51,140
Scott: So, you know, the classic Bugs Bunny cartoon, What's Opera Doc?

423
00:21:52,124 --> 00:21:52,940
Rym: One of my favorites.

424
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,188
Scott: The Spear and Magic Helmet.

425
00:21:54,209 --> 00:21:55,420
Scott: It's everyone's favorite, right?

426
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,560
Rym: I like the the opera singer one a little better.

427
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:05,221
Scott: Yeah, well, anyway, but there was some guy made a remix of it a while ago from 2005.

428
00:22:05,221 --> 00:22:05,342
Scott: Right.

429
00:22:05,402 --> 00:22:07,498
Scott: And DJ BC made this remix in '05.

430
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:21,440
Scott: But just now in '12, some guy, I don't know if it's the same guy or a different guy, made remix the video to go along with that remix song.

431
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:29,299
Scott: And now it is much more presentable and accessible and entertaining on the YouTube than the song and MPV format alone.

432
00:22:29,821 --> 00:22:33,580
Scott: And thus that is now quality enough to become a thing of the day.

433
00:22:34,321 --> 00:22:35,104
Scott: You should watch it.

434
00:22:35,144 --> 00:22:39,980
Scott: It's only got like 302 views and it actually has like four dislikes.

435
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,015
Scott: And I'm like, what?

436
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:53,420
Rym: I realize, you know, watching YouTube videos and messing around with statistics and everything that it seems like any new video that goes up gets some dislikes, no matter what it is after a certain amount of time.

437
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,922
Scott: I don't you know, the thing is, is like I don't dislike anything like, you know, I just never like.

438
00:22:57,963 --> 00:23:03,700
Scott: sometimes I'll be like, oh, I don't remember this video like, but like I'll never feel like dislike.

439
00:23:04,661 --> 00:23:06,620
Scott: I'll never get that feeling to go and do that.

440
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,000
Scott: Like I don't even know why they even have the thumbs down there.

441
00:23:09,726 --> 00:23:10,473
Scott: I don't know, whatever.

442
00:23:10,977 --> 00:23:11,320
Scott: Who cares?

443
00:23:12,223 --> 00:23:13,249
Rym: Yeah, that's an interesting.

444
00:23:13,269 --> 00:23:15,000
Rym: we could talk about the design of that and what it does.

445
00:23:15,241 --> 00:23:15,965
Rym: There's a game there.

446
00:23:15,985 --> 00:23:18,580
Scott: Yeah, but it's like I never even think to click thumbs down.

447
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,062
Scott: Maybe if I watched a video and it's painful, I might think to click it, but it's never happened.

448
00:23:23,705 --> 00:23:26,260
Rym: So He-Man is horrible.

449
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:33,280
Rym: You should never watch it if you didn't know better, unless it's the live action movie, which I kind of want to watch again so we can do a show on.

450
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,980
Scott: Or unless it's for research purposes.

451
00:23:35,761 --> 00:23:37,179
Rym: Yeah, but even then, it's rough.

452
00:23:37,941 --> 00:23:38,223
Scott: It is.

453
00:23:38,243 --> 00:23:48,187
Rym: I would suggest if you ever want to research He-Man, have someone do the research of the show who never saw it as a child and thus will not realize that they were, in fact, an idiot when they were five.

454
00:23:48,207 --> 00:23:49,999
Scott: So, you know, the toys are kind of OK.

455
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,759
Scott: The comic books are a lot like the show.

456
00:23:52,603 --> 00:23:53,719
Rym: I've never read the comic books.

457
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,687
Rym: I'm kind of intrigued.

458
00:23:54,727 --> 00:23:56,080
Scott: It was originally a comic book.

459
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,845
Scott: I think it's British.

460
00:23:56,905 --> 00:24:03,180
Rym: If I'm not mistaken, I was reading a Wikipedia article about it a long time ago when I was trying to when I thought, hey, I wonder if He-Man was good.

461
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:15,800
Rym: I remember trying to figure out what Skeletor's deal was because I realized as a kid I never in my entire childhood of watching He-Man religiously had any idea what Castle of Grayskull actually was or who the fuck Skeletor was.

462
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,760
Scott: I kept trying to understand.

463
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,939
Scott: Like when I was a kid also, I couldn't really understand it.

464
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,411
Rym: I was like, what does He-Man want?

465
00:24:20,431 --> 00:24:21,580
Rym: What is Skeletor after?

466
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,040
Scott: It's like Castle of Grayskull was like the big toy.

467
00:24:24,301 --> 00:24:30,595
Scott: But it's like they spent most of their time in this other castle that was more fancy and futuristic and they hardly ever went to Castle of Grayskull.

468
00:24:30,616 --> 00:24:31,280
Scott: that I could remember.

469
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:31,925
Scott: And it was just weird.

470
00:24:32,188 --> 00:24:33,240
Scott: And this is why you don't watch He-Man.

471
00:24:33,822 --> 00:24:41,320
Rym: Yeah, but anyway, here's a compilation of a good number of the insults that come out of Skeletor's skeleton mouth.

472
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:46,259
Scott: And hey, Rym, you have shitty things in your day.

473
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:48,079
Rym: It's it's pretty great.

474
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:54,159
Rym: It reminded me both how great He-Man was and how terribly great He-Man was.

475
00:24:55,801 --> 00:24:57,540
Scott: You said was is not the wrong term.

476
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,438
Scott: He-Man still is.

477
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,147
Rym: No, it isn't.

478
00:24:59,309 --> 00:24:59,920
Rym: It's not an is.

479
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,365
Rym: It's a was.

480
00:25:00,385 --> 00:25:01,420
Scott: It doesn't exist anymore.

481
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:07,760
Rym: The He-Man that I saw as the child is a was because that can never be experienced again, except through the mind of an idiot child.

482
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,680
Scott: I could just bash you over the head a whole bunch of times.

483
00:25:10,123 --> 00:25:10,675
Rym: That might work.

484
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,580
Rym: So in the meta moment, we're going to be at the Penny Arcade Expo.

485
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,199
Rym: Holy shit.

486
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:17,124
Scott: Oh, yeah.

487
00:25:17,144 --> 00:25:17,740
Scott: I didn't see that coming.

488
00:25:17,981 --> 00:25:18,411
Rym: Oh, my God.

489
00:25:18,452 --> 00:25:18,840
Rym: It's coming.

490
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:19,788
Rym: It's coming.

491
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:20,419
Rym: We're going to be there.

492
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:25,120
Rym: I picked my book club book, but I'll do a separate show where we talk about why.

493
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,479
Rym: But a little heads up.

494
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:31,740
Rym: The book club book is going to be The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins.

495
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,940
Scott: I have not heard the positive things.

496
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:34,705
Scott: It seems to be.

497
00:25:34,726 --> 00:25:36,460
Rym: I've heard nothing but positive things.

498
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,039
Rym: Everyone's flipping out about this book and the movies come in.

499
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,277
Rym: So I want to see what the deal is.

500
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:44,060
Scott: Yeah, but this isn't the kind of positive buzz you usually hear about something that's actually good.

501
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,679
Scott: It's like I can sort of tell by the smell.

502
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:53,080
Scott: It's the same kind of buzz I got from, let's see, Harry Potter and Twilight and those sorts of things that people like that aren't actually good.

503
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,159
Rym: So I'm going to let you in on a secret that I'm not going to say in the real book club book show.

504
00:25:56,962 --> 00:25:58,960
Rym: I read the whole book while I was at the airport.

505
00:26:00,263 --> 00:26:01,418
Rym: And it's actually pretty good.

506
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:07,320
Rym: Yeah, like I was really I thought I'd read it to then do a book club book show about.

507
00:26:07,622 --> 00:26:09,299
Rym: Yeah, you guys like this book, but it's kind of crap.

508
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,339
Rym: Battle Royale, whatever.

509
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:10,889
Rym: But you know what?

510
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:11,340
Scott: That's what I heard.

511
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,080
Scott: I heard it was crappy battle royale above.

512
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:18,121
Rym: It's more like Running Man crossed with 1984.

513
00:26:18,121 --> 00:26:21,200
Rym: Which are running men of the Arnold, of course.

514
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,103
Scott: Oh, OK.

515
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:22,928
Rym: Who out there?

516
00:26:22,968 --> 00:26:25,059
Rym: but you knows about your running man?

517
00:26:25,921 --> 00:26:28,660
Rym: All of Korea, South Korea, outside of Korea.

518
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,267
Rym: Who else?

519
00:26:29,815 --> 00:26:30,160
Scott: Conrad.

520
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,201
Rym: Yeah.

521
00:26:31,302 --> 00:26:35,056
Rym: So Arnold running man, but 1984 style with a little bit of.

522
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,120
Rym: I'd buy that for a dollar.

523
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:36,702
Rym: It's pretty good.

524
00:26:38,069 --> 00:26:40,239
Rym: More so than I expect is that's going to be the book club book.

525
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,340
Scott: Well, if you read it just at the airport, then it's I could probably read it real fast.

526
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:43,806
Rym: It's short.

527
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:44,540
Rym: It's well written.

528
00:26:44,942 --> 00:26:45,752
Rym: I don't know what I can say.

529
00:26:45,773 --> 00:26:46,198
Rym: And you know what?

530
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,778
Scott: Isn't there multiples of them?

531
00:26:48,161 --> 00:26:51,080
Rym: I only read the first one, but it is, in fact, I think, a trilogy.

532
00:26:52,305 --> 00:26:52,607
Scott: Great.

533
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:54,199
Rym: Well, we're only doing the first book.

534
00:26:56,263 --> 00:27:00,660
Rym: Oh, I just figured out what the third book is going to be about because the title anyway gives it all the way.

535
00:27:01,501 --> 00:27:01,883
Scott: Maybe, maybe.

536
00:27:01,923 --> 00:27:04,578
Scott: May I have to pick a book that you of evil next time?

537
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,800
Scott: Why would you pick a book of evil?

538
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:12,399
Scott: Well, since you've read this entire book already, maybe I'll read it extra quickly and we'll do this book club right away and then get it out.

539
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,099
Scott: You know, and then I'll come out with something else.

540
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:19,579
Rym: Well, if you do something I don't like, I got to warn you, the nonfiction is coming out.

541
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,388
Rym: I'll do that.

542
00:27:22,468 --> 00:27:24,600
Rym: The Norman Davies book I'm reading right now.

543
00:27:24,701 --> 00:27:26,040
Scott: I'll have to do, then I'll have to count.

544
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,620
Rym: Four hundred pages of like, Prussian history.

545
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,840
Scott: I'll have to counter with ultimate fiction.

546
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,509
Rym: Uh, Scott, you counter with ultimate fiction.

547
00:27:33,951 --> 00:27:35,940
Rym: I'll counter, counter with the Katamani Cristo.

548
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,079
Scott: I can counter with Ulysses.

549
00:27:38,582 --> 00:27:40,140
Rym: You're seriously going to read Ulysses.

550
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,440
Rym: That's like coming to me with the Davy Crockett nuclear artillery and even trying to make a threat.

551
00:27:46,803 --> 00:27:47,374
Scott: It's basically...

552
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,459
Rym: For you listeners who are not aware, the Davy Crockett...

553
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,580
Scott: Ramble isn't a reason.

554
00:27:52,225 --> 00:27:53,480
Rym: The Davy Crockett artillery.

555
00:27:53,581 --> 00:27:54,979
Scott: Got a nuke in the motorcycle situation.

556
00:27:55,100 --> 00:28:02,140
Rym: Was notable in that it was nuclear artillery whose range was such that the person firing it was inside of the blast.

557
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,038
Scott: That is correct.

558
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,138
Rym: So yeah, Hunger Games is going to be the book club book.

559
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,439
Rym: I cheated because I already read it and it was pretty good.

560
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:10,550
Scott: Great.

561
00:28:10,571 --> 00:28:10,815
Scott: All right.

562
00:28:11,901 --> 00:28:14,160
Rym: Internet, YouTube channel, all that stuff.

563
00:28:15,981 --> 00:28:23,080
Rym: So we were trying to figure out what to do a Monday show on this morning and I wanted to do the fixed protocol, a single protocol.

564
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,479
Scott: Which nobody cares about.

565
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:29,080
Rym: Actually, I think people would because I think there's a lot to talk about related to the fixed protocol.

566
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:33,780
Rym: Why it's the way it is, is a nice study of how to design a protocol for a thing.

567
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:41,040
Scott: Maybe in general and from that general perspective, maybe someone cares, but no one I think that is not a financial person gives a shit.

568
00:28:41,283 --> 00:28:41,939
Rym: I think they would.

569
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:55,540
Rym: Anyone who's technological, if you want a job that pays a lot of money, knowing the fixed protocol at all, you'll know it more than the majority of tech people in the financial world and you will be in surprisingly high demand.

570
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:03,699
Rym: But you have to be OK with writing software to interface between the fixed protocol and arbitrary middleware as in like L.L.M.

571
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:07,999
Rym: or 59 West or stuff like that, maybe like Active MQ.

572
00:29:09,721 --> 00:29:10,525
Rym: But I digress.

573
00:29:10,565 --> 00:29:12,493
Rym: So then we started talking about other acronyms.

574
00:29:12,574 --> 00:29:14,000
Rym: and oh, should we do a show?

575
00:29:14,603 --> 00:29:16,280
Scott: Yeah, we can do a show on that acronym.

576
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,660
Scott: Let's just do a show on every acronym one by one and that'll fill us with Monday shows forever.

577
00:29:20,901 --> 00:29:24,960
Rym: And it's kind of a good idea, but some acronyms are more equal than others.

578
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:29,899
Rym: I mean, FTP, there is literally nothing interesting to say about FTP.

579
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:38,260
Rym: Put other than get passive versus active FTP is something that no one out there actually understands.

580
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,080
Scott: There's also a binary in ASCII mode.

581
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,420
Rym: Yep, except binary by default.

582
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,696
Rym: Duh, duh.

583
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,080
Rym: Who even uses ASCII mode for anything?

584
00:29:47,523 --> 00:29:48,660
Scott: You want to send a text file?

585
00:29:49,342 --> 00:29:50,080
Rym: Yeah, binary mode.

586
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:50,502
Rym: Jesus.

587
00:29:50,904 --> 00:29:54,240
Rym: Otherwise, you're going to run into the whole Unix versus win anyway.

588
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,960
Scott: Well, that's if it's a Unicode text file, but I'm talking about if you have an ASCII text file for real.

589
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,219
Rym: Who has that and needs to FTP it?

590
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,716
Rym: The real problem is passive versus active.

591
00:30:06,441 --> 00:30:07,099
Rym: You know the difference?

592
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,005
Rym: Because I don't I did.

593
00:30:11,025 --> 00:30:16,500
Scott: I remember it every time that I you have to engage with it, I remember what the deal is and then I forget it again.

594
00:30:17,022 --> 00:30:22,120
Rym: It only matters to the guy who manages the firewall between two people who just want to transfer a file.

595
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,359
Scott: Isn't it one like the ports?

596
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:30,840
Scott: Oh, is it like one where like the ports open and you're holding it and then it's like you hold the TCP connection open all the time.

597
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,060
Scott: And the other one is a little more complicated.

598
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:39,260
Scott: You hit you send the packet to when you want to do something and then it opens you up another port where you send your thing and then you close that.

599
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,599
Rym: Kind of it's a little more complex.

600
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,279
Rym: Remember, FTP has two channels.

601
00:30:42,982 --> 00:30:45,840
Rym: It has these file sending channel and the command control channel.

602
00:30:46,821 --> 00:30:47,722
Rym: So it has to do.

603
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:57,800
Rym: basically the simple way to put it is you pick passive or active depending on who you want the firewall configuration to be a pain in the ass for the guy on the other side or the guy who manages your network.

604
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,280
Scott: The guy with the server has to do the pain in the ass here.

605
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:05,160
Rym: The real answer is use SCP and or SFT.

606
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,720
Scott: But then you have to share keys and stuff and make a count, something like that, which is annoying.

607
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:11,320
Rym: Nobody does that in the real world.

608
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:14,660
Rym: As far as I found, the majority of techies just use password association.

609
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,184
Rym: That's it.

610
00:31:16,677 --> 00:31:17,080
Scott: That's awful.

611
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,199
Rym: But I digress.

612
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:24,840
Rym: So we were talking about acronyms and we realized we'd never actually done a show on like network mounted storage.

613
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,359
Scott: So we did a show about NASes and why you should get one.

614
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:41,660
Scott: But we didn't talk about the specifics of the different, you know, technologies, the protocols that are used to actually share the files and mount storage, you know, connect storage devices to other computers across a network.

615
00:31:42,122 --> 00:31:46,720
Scott: You know, like SIFs, Samba, NFS, DRVD, all these guys.

616
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,660
Scott: We didn't talk about those guys.

617
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:52,180
Rym: In fact, I'm pretty sure we said like, yeah, good NASes unless you share all those arbitrary protocols.

618
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:57,860
Scott: You can even use there's even like HTTP mounts, SSH mounts, you know, there's all kinds of stuff out there.

619
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:58,201
Rym: Yep.

620
00:31:58,362 --> 00:32:00,300
Rym: So we figured we'd go through some of those and kind of talk.

621
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,822
Rym: You know, it's a nice way to.

622
00:32:01,903 --> 00:32:11,680
Rym: you know, I always try to find tech topics because Scott insists that Monday shows should be about technology itself and not like pseudo technology, like commenting on blogs.

623
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,181
Scott: Yeah.

624
00:32:13,622 --> 00:32:21,700
Scott: Or, you know, the industries are that's a social that's it's a media topic that is only technological because everything is technological.

625
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:22,121
Scott: Right.

626
00:32:22,141 --> 00:32:25,840
Scott: I mean, you want to you know, we could take the excuse and do a show about journalism.

627
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:34,720
Scott: Well, because every industry now in the world and everything is not technological, everything technology has its grip on everything in our entire society.

628
00:32:35,101 --> 00:32:39,011
Scott: But so we could do a show about chemical factories and it could.

629
00:32:39,071 --> 00:32:42,520
Scott: oh, it's a technological show because there's computers in chemical factories.

630
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,920
Rym: Let's do a show about the biological, sole biological processes of pooping.

631
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,320
Scott: Well, that's a science show, which is OK for Monday.

632
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:52,839
Rym: OK, so science or technology.

633
00:32:53,081 --> 00:32:53,222
Rym: Right.

634
00:32:53,242 --> 00:32:56,060
Scott: But you're talking about if you want to talk about journalism, that's a social topic.

635
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,699
Scott: That's not a technological topic.

636
00:32:58,103 --> 00:32:58,680
Rym: Pooping, journalism.

637
00:33:02,502 --> 00:33:08,900
Rym: I don't think most people out there actually really even technologists know about these things and or use them.

638
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:20,860
Scott: Well, I think the thing is, a lot of people who do use them, they know like the commands maybe or what you have to do to make them work, but they don't actually know how they work or what's going on down low.

639
00:33:21,883 --> 00:33:24,339
Scott: And I don't really know half as much as I should.

640
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,279
Scott: Yeah, because I tend to just look up the commands, make it work, and that's it.

641
00:33:27,741 --> 00:33:35,460
Rym: I knew a lot more than I do now because I use IT, like that was part of my education was like the lowdown, like SMB, like the protocol itself.

642
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:41,240
Rym: We learned a lot of core technology that has not actually been applicable in my later life.

643
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,536
Scott: Because no one uses that anymore.

644
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,739
Rym: But even, you know, there's some basic stuff you should know.

645
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:50,339
Rym: So you want to start with SMB, because I guess that's the one most people know about and use.

646
00:33:50,601 --> 00:33:55,360
Scott: Well, SMB is also known as Samba because there was an open source thing called Samba.

647
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,520
Scott: That was the open source SMB sort of software, client server software.

648
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:02,980
Rym: You know it as effectively, you'll think of it as Windows file sharing.

649
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,459
Scott: Well, the old Windows file sharing.

650
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:07,218
Rym: Yeah, well, the new Windows file sharing is pretty much CIFS.

651
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,708
Scott: Right, which is Active Directory as opposed to work groups.

652
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,181
Rym: No, no, no.

653
00:34:13,442 --> 00:34:19,380
Rym: Active Directory is nothing more than a glorified LDAP that it's a directory structure to list stuff.

654
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,750
Rym: It has nothing to do with the sharing itself.

655
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:22,018
Rym: It's just the authentication for it.

656
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:22,521
Scott: Right.

657
00:34:22,641 --> 00:34:31,360
Scott: But that's what goes, you know, CIFS is basically the SMB that goes with the Active Directory, whereas SMB Active Directory is like old busted.

658
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:35,340
Rym: That's a conflation that you should not go down that road because you're very close to being wrong.

659
00:34:37,202 --> 00:34:38,800
Rym: Let's just talk about file sharing.

660
00:34:39,242 --> 00:34:40,699
Rym: So Windows file sharing.

661
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,080
Scott: I'm sure we should first mention that SMB and such also does like printer sharing and all sorts of weird shit like that.

662
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:46,440
Rym: Yeah.

663
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:47,918
Rym: Do you know what SMB stands for?

664
00:34:49,364 --> 00:34:51,599
Scott: Is it like symmetric multi something?

665
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:53,337
Rym: OK.

666
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,199
Rym: CIFS is like common Internet file system.

667
00:34:55,621 --> 00:34:58,100
Rym: And I actually did not even know the acronym SMB ever.

668
00:34:58,241 --> 00:34:58,979
Rym: So I had to look it up.

669
00:34:59,281 --> 00:35:01,475
Scott: I thought it was like symmetric multi, but no.

670
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,218
Rym: Server message block.

671
00:35:03,705 --> 00:35:03,747
Scott: OK.

672
00:35:04,768 --> 00:35:04,980
Scott: Yeah.

673
00:35:05,101 --> 00:35:05,438
Scott: Nice.

674
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,220
Rym: It's one of those things where you try to guess and you're wrong.

675
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,539
Rym: Like, you're never going to get that one.

676
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:15,100
Rym: I never would have guessed when I was when I was first learning about hardware that ISA was like industry standard architecture.

677
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:15,818
Rym: You didn't know that?

678
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:21,160
Rym: When I first learned about computers, I looked at this bus and I was like, all right, it must the accurate.

679
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,798
Rym: It must have something to do with the bus.

680
00:35:23,142 --> 00:35:24,598
Rym: No, no, no.

681
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,060
Scott: AGP does it anyway.

682
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,420
Rym: So SMB and CIFS are pretty much the windows way of sharing files.

683
00:35:33,581 --> 00:35:36,179
Rym: And Linux actually kind of sucks at it.

684
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,160
Scott: Well, I mean, there is Samba, like we said, which sort of does it.

685
00:35:39,281 --> 00:35:39,868
Scott: And it works.

686
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:40,900
Scott: like you can make it work.

687
00:35:41,021 --> 00:35:42,220
Scott: And I've made it work in the past.

688
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,620
Scott: And OS X works, but has its weird, quirky differences when it comes to using this.

689
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,940
Scott: But it also just kind of works like you can mount and type in the right the thing.

690
00:35:52,020 --> 00:36:00,700
Scott: The major problem with both Samba, SMB and CIFS is that when you add, you know, the you know, the patterns of the your eyes or your ends or whatever they're called.

691
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,061
Scott: Right.

692
00:36:01,221 --> 00:36:01,723
Scott: Because they're not.

693
00:36:01,783 --> 00:36:07,360
Scott: they don't look like URLs of like double backslashes and all these things very noncompatible.

694
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:07,682
Rym: Right.

695
00:36:07,964 --> 00:36:10,140
Scott: They tend to change like on your Windows machine.

696
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:16,434
Scott: You'd be like, oh, how do I connect to this service was backslash backslash DRV-01C2 and then it works.

697
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,459
Scott: But then on your you want to connect to the same thing on the Mac.

698
00:36:22,045 --> 00:36:22,980
Scott: Oh, well, it's on there.

699
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:28,220
Scott: You actually have to do like SMB colon forward slash forward slash something, something, something.

700
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,620
Scott: And it's totally different, even though it's the same exact thing in the same exact protocol.

701
00:36:33,161 --> 00:36:37,060
Scott: The names of the spots that you're connecting to have different patterns.

702
00:36:37,242 --> 00:36:38,579
Scott: And it's really annoying as all hell.

703
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:45,060
Scott: And like sometimes like, you know, want you to use a password, but you won't have the password configured, but it'll ask you for one anyway.

704
00:36:45,381 --> 00:36:46,958
Scott: And you won't know what to type in.

705
00:36:47,681 --> 00:36:58,500
Scott: And it's like no one's following, you know, the same steps, even though the actual underlying protocol is the same and the code that handles that is 90 percent identical.

706
00:36:59,041 --> 00:36:59,562
Scott: Really annoying.

707
00:36:59,783 --> 00:37:05,700
Rym: Now, at the same time, though, like if using just Windows, it is actually a pretty great way to share files.

708
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,283
Scott: Yeah, it does.

709
00:37:06,323 --> 00:37:10,100
Scott: Just if you're using just Windows and you set it up properly, everything just works.

710
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:10,461
Rym: Yep.

711
00:37:10,924 --> 00:37:12,800
Scott: And a lot of people, though, do have trouble with it.

712
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,280
Rym: And it's because they do it wrong, mostly because they don't understand how it works at the low level.

713
00:37:17,621 --> 00:37:22,460
Rym: So they try to like, you know, they go to their network tab and try to browse for something that isn't on the local network.

714
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:30,840
Rym: And without a wind server or directory or something to tell their computer where the other thing is, then they're not going to find what they're looking for.

715
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:35,199
Scott: So if you want to set up Windows sharing between two Windows computers or something like that, here's what you do.

716
00:37:35,642 --> 00:37:38,960
Scott: This is the easiest guaranteed way of making it work with no trouble.

717
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,620
Scott: First, you've got to have Windows computers that aren't fucked the fuck up.

718
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,320
Scott: If you fuck them up, then I got no help for you.

719
00:37:45,661 --> 00:37:47,300
Rym: Also, not old Windows computers.

720
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:47,640
Rym: Right.

721
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:54,180
Scott: You have to follow the policies of Scott and never installing weird bullshit on your computer or changing settings from the defaults for no reason or any bullshit like that.

722
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,278
Scott: Then find the folder you want to share.

723
00:37:56,339 --> 00:37:56,460
Scott: Right.

724
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,880
Scott: Click on that motherfucker, go to sharing and say, share that bitch.

725
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,054
Scott: Simple sharing.

726
00:38:02,095 --> 00:38:02,279
Scott: Go.

727
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,062
Scott: Right.

728
00:38:03,629 --> 00:38:04,640
Scott: OK, now it's shared.

729
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:06,120
Scott: But no one can see it, really.

730
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:10,520
Scott: So what you got to do is you got to go and make a home group or a work group or whatever you want to call it.

731
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,599
Rym: Now, home groups are actually pretty new.

732
00:38:12,902 --> 00:38:13,185
Scott: Yeah.

733
00:38:13,508 --> 00:38:14,599
Scott: And whatever Windows you got.

734
00:38:15,141 --> 00:38:21,439
Rym: What's interesting is that nobody I know knows how it works or even realizes what it is.

735
00:38:22,202 --> 00:38:24,600
Rym: Windows kind of makes you set it up when you set up a Windows.

736
00:38:25,201 --> 00:38:28,019
Rym: You know, it detects other PCs like, hey, there's a home group here.

737
00:38:28,542 --> 00:38:30,320
Rym: Get the code from the other computer.

738
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,083
Rym: And it's right.

739
00:38:31,404 --> 00:38:34,540
Scott: So the first computer you set up is the one that establishes the home group.

740
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,740
Scott: And the other ones connect to the home group.

741
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:37,422
Scott: Right.

742
00:38:37,904 --> 00:38:42,020
Scott: And you just have to type in the same name for the home group and the same username and password.

743
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:48,540
Scott: If you have one on all the computers on your LAN, on the same LAN, and they'll all be in the same home group as each other.

744
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,699
Scott: And they'll be able to see each other's shares and they'll just be there.

745
00:38:53,561 --> 00:38:58,280
Scott: And then you just share the shares and then you go double click on my network and you'll see the shares in there.

746
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,540
Scott: And you can just right click on them and be like mount or connect or open or whatever.

747
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:11,760
Scott: And all the printers or files that are shared, they'll just be there and you can connect to them and make them work as your local printer or as your local hard drive.

748
00:39:11,901 --> 00:39:13,900
Scott: And your computer won't really know the difference.

749
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:24,480
Scott: But there are some Windows applications I've noticed that would be like they'll be able to detect the fact that it's a network share and they'd be like, oh, no, I don't use network shares and they won't go on there.

750
00:39:25,204 --> 00:39:26,159
Rym: But never run into that.

751
00:39:26,401 --> 00:39:28,800
Scott: I've run into that or it's like, no, I will not.

752
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,600
Scott: I refuse to save a file to a network share.

753
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,978
Scott: You have to save a file to a local share.

754
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,760
Rym: Usually that has to do with permissions being weird.

755
00:39:35,321 --> 00:39:38,907
Scott: No, like specifically the program popped up a window, a dialog.

756
00:39:38,927 --> 00:39:46,420
Scott: that said, I this program cannot use, you know, you cannot put your like whatever library on a network share.

757
00:39:46,501 --> 00:39:47,758
Scott: It must be on a local disk.

758
00:39:48,387 --> 00:39:48,980
Rym: That's interesting.

759
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:49,512
Scott: I get new.

760
00:39:50,562 --> 00:39:52,839
Rym: Yeah, you could know from the way the resources anyway.

761
00:39:53,281 --> 00:39:53,405
Scott: Yeah.

762
00:39:53,551 --> 00:39:53,800
Scott: Anyway.

763
00:39:54,823 --> 00:39:57,380
Rym: But really, Windows sharing, everyone I know has problems with it.

764
00:39:58,023 --> 00:39:59,200
Scott: Try to do too much of this.

765
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:21,280
Rym: One, Windows, if you set it up by default, will often have trouble when it tries to when you try to connect to a Windows share from the outside with a device that either isn't in the same work group or isn't in the domain, or if the like the usernames, like people will often be in like a domain or something.

766
00:40:21,782 --> 00:40:24,980
Rym: And then they try to log into a share on some other computer that's set up differently.

767
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:31,920
Rym: And it'll ask for the account, but it'll want to use the same like username between the two.

768
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:42,180
Rym: So if I have the Rym account on my PC and there's a local Rym account on the other PC and I, you know, it tries to always connect with like a default account and then it'll say, hey, do you want to connect with other credentials?

769
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:51,540
Rym: The Windows UI for using different credentials, like the other guy's username instead of your username are actually pretty counterintuitive.

770
00:40:51,941 --> 00:40:58,455
Scott: And usually because you don't know if you're supposed you don't know if it's like, is it forwarding by account locally to the other computer?

771
00:40:58,495 --> 00:41:00,960
Scott: or does it want the account from the other computer or what?

772
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:01,782
Scott: Like what does it want?

773
00:41:01,882 --> 00:41:08,500
Scott: Like mine is if you don't have an active directory with a single sign on for your whole network, you have no idea which account you want to use.

774
00:41:09,124 --> 00:41:10,440
Rym: Like mine is a good example.

775
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:13,279
Rym: I set it up to do simple like standard Windows file sharing.

776
00:41:13,981 --> 00:41:18,900
Rym: And yet whenever I connect to it, it'll be like, hey, what account do you want to use?

777
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:30,940
Rym: And if I use Rym and my password, it usually will freak out and say, ah, and then I have to click connect with alternate credentials, type the exact same thing in and then it'll work.

778
00:41:31,361 --> 00:41:37,160
Scott: Right, because the first time is trying to use your local Rym, which is wrong, and the second time it'll actually use the other Rym from the other side.

779
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:46,720
Rym: But on Emily's computer, where just by hook or crook, the username on the NAS is a different local account name from the local account she uses on her computer, it just wouldn't fucking let her connect.

780
00:41:48,601 --> 00:42:00,860
Rym: And the moral of all this is that NASes tend to not really be configurable enough compared to a Windows box and tend to implement Windows type sharing kind of shittily.

781
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,474
Scott: You know what I do.

782
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:08,980
Rym: And you're going to run into all these problems and the devices tend to not give you any reasonable logs to tell you how to fix it.

783
00:42:09,381 --> 00:42:14,340
Rym: And your Windows PC doesn't give you any reasonable kind of errors or dialogues to tell you how to fix it.

784
00:42:14,721 --> 00:42:18,840
Rym: And unless you know how SMB works or CIFS works, you're not going to fix it.

785
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:20,700
Scott: Here's the solution that I have in my house.

786
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,405
Scott: You know what it is?

787
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:22,920
Scott: I have all the shares.

788
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:26,100
Scott: It's just completely anonymous, wide open, full access shares.

789
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:26,759
Rym: Yeah, I don't do that.

790
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,460
Scott: And then I have network level security.

791
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:35,920
Scott: So if you come into my house and try to use the internets, you'll connect on the Wi-Fi, which is a separate Wi-Fi and a separate subnet.

792
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,440
Scott: And you won't even see that NAS, even though it's right there in front of you.

793
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,460
Rym: See, now, the reason I didn't do that is because I have one NAS where I made three shares.

794
00:42:42,984 --> 00:42:44,980
Rym: Well, I have a private share for me and a private share for Emily.

795
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:48,729
Rym: And then I have a media share that's public to anyone in my house.

796
00:42:48,789 --> 00:42:52,480
Rym: because, you know, anyone around, I say, like, hey, you know, take any of my movies you want.

797
00:42:53,161 --> 00:42:57,280
Rym: But I want me and Emily to have right access to that and no one else to have right access.

798
00:42:58,662 --> 00:43:00,218
Rym: And then the most important thing I have...

799
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:01,079
Scott: Now you're getting fancy.

800
00:43:01,421 --> 00:43:02,100
Rym: I have a Dropbox.

801
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:06,300
Rym: So when someone's over and they're like, hey, I have this movie, I'm like, yeah, dump it on my Dropbox.

802
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:10,080
Scott: Ah, see, well, actually, you know, I got all kinds of different stuff going on, right?

803
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:16,300
Scott: So if someone has to dump me the movie, well, the HTPC is on the local network so they can dump it, you know, through there.

804
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:22,840
Scott: There's also my NAS as a feature where you can put a USB stick in and push a button and it'll just take the whole USB stick and put it on itself.

805
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:31,040
Scott: So, you know, I got a lot of ways to get files from people who want to dump, you know, and also I don't have multiple people in the house to manage.

806
00:43:31,142 --> 00:43:31,325
Scott: Right.

807
00:43:31,345 --> 00:43:32,078
Scott: It's just me.

808
00:43:32,561 --> 00:43:37,000
Scott: So I don't need to have like the separate account for the other people with the separate shares to share different things.

809
00:43:37,462 --> 00:43:40,680
Rym: Also, when we have large gatherings, you know, it tends to be at my place.

810
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,460
Rym: So people are using my shit a lot more than they use your shit directly.

811
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:45,581
Scott: Yeah.

812
00:43:45,601 --> 00:43:47,820
Scott: If they want to come to my house, there's plenty of shit they can use.

813
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:49,640
Scott: They just can't be accessing my files.

814
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,958
Rym: I let people access my files.

815
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,099
Scott: I don't want to access my files.

816
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:57,580
Rym: But, you know, aside from NASes, regular Windows file sharing pretty much just works.

817
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:05,960
Rym: The tricks are when you're using non-Windows devices like a NAS or more importantly, a fucking Mac that can't connect to fucking anonymous shares because it's a fucking Mac.

818
00:44:07,382 --> 00:44:10,180
Rym: Why do Macs handle this so poorly?

819
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:15,240
Rym: Because Linux handles Samba SMB shares really poorly.

820
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,239
Scott: Well, that's not to do with Linux.

821
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,019
Scott: It has to do with Samba, right?

822
00:44:18,501 --> 00:44:19,837
Scott: Because OSX is Unix.

823
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:20,857
Scott: It's not Linux.

824
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:21,382
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

825
00:44:21,423 --> 00:44:22,800
Rym: So Unix and Linux, right?

826
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:26,260
Rym: Many times the problems with them are not the core.

827
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:31,580
Rym: You know, GNU/Linux is fine, but Samba is implemented by someone else and they don't do it that well.

828
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,780
Rym: Problem is, because there's no other good alternative.

829
00:44:35,641 --> 00:44:40,040
Rym: It effectively is a Linux problem, even though it's not really a Linux problem.

830
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,400
Scott: It's a Starnix problem.

831
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:45,660
Scott: Anyone using anything that uses the open source Samba thing has this problem.

832
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:50,500
Rym: It's yet one other reason why Linux kind of sucks on the desktop unless you're just a developer.

833
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:54,540
Scott: Well, you know, the thing is, if you're doing the basic stuff of just connecting, it kind of works.

834
00:44:54,680 --> 00:45:03,300
Scott: If you're doing if you have like a standard active directory that's configured properly and you have like SUSE Linux, Susie, whatever it's pronounced, then it kind of just works.

835
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:08,660
Scott: But if you got anything weird and you have to change configurations, it's possible to make it work.

836
00:45:09,648 --> 00:45:10,360
Scott: It's just a nightmare.

837
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:16,440
Rym: Yeah, we're not talking about using Samba to run like a Windows domain because that's way out of scope.

838
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:17,399
Scott: Fuck that shit.

839
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:28,380
Rym: But you should be able to mount someone else's Samba share or someone else's Windows share on your Linux box if you install Samba and you read a FAQ.

840
00:45:28,961 --> 00:45:35,360
Rym: But really, for most people, it's not worth trying to get your Linux box to share two Windows boxes.

841
00:45:35,842 --> 00:45:36,840
Rym: You're going to run into trouble.

842
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:38,259
Rym: It's usually not worth the effort.

843
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:38,620
Scott: Right.

844
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:50,940
Rym: So let's talk about another really common thing, NFS, it's the network file system, which is basically, sadly, the easiest to use sharing protocol if you're only using Linux boxes.

845
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:51,641
Scott: Yeah.

846
00:45:51,702 --> 00:45:54,660
Scott: I mean, if you're only using Unix machines, NFS just works.

847
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,399
Scott: It's really easy.

848
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:02,240
Scott: Basically, you know, normally you would mount local block devices to spot two places in your file system.

849
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,934
Scott: So you'd be like mount dev SD0 to /mnt.

850
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:06,422
Scott: Done.

851
00:46:07,107 --> 00:46:08,700
Scott: Network file system is pretty much the same thing.

852
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:14,640
Scott: It's like, hey, mount this IP address/projects to home projects.

853
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,385
Scott: Ta-da!

854
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:16,879
Scott: And it just works like that.

855
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:21,900
Scott: And, you know, the permissions, the Unix file system permissions are kind of preserved and forwarded through.

856
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:24,180
Rym: Which again, this is why it doesn't work so well with Windows.

857
00:46:24,421 --> 00:46:24,641
Rym: Right.

858
00:46:24,661 --> 00:46:31,500
Scott: Which is good and bad, because on the one hand, if you've got a bunch of machines all connecting to the same NFS and they all have the same user accounts, all good.

859
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:46,900
Scott: But if like, if on this machine, you know, user ID 1001 is me and on that machine user ID 1001 is Rym, I might save a file to the NFS and then Rym has access to it if he comes through that other computer because his user ID matches the right file system up there.

860
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:53,660
Rym: The whole fact that user IDs are used the way they are between systems and Linux has actually been a major pain for me for a long time.

861
00:46:53,882 --> 00:46:54,693
Scott: But it just works.

862
00:46:54,774 --> 00:46:55,159
Scott: It's easy.

863
00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:02,739
Scott: You just start it up and you can connect in like two commands and suddenly you have a hard drive that can be mounted on multiple computers simultaneously.

864
00:47:03,603 --> 00:47:04,088
Scott: And it works.

865
00:47:04,451 --> 00:47:05,280
Scott: And it's kind of fast.

866
00:47:05,442 --> 00:47:07,020
Scott: But this is some other problems, right?

867
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:18,620
Rym: Well, one, if you don't know what you're doing, you know, there's a lot of configuration options when you set this up and you have to do it, you know, auto-mounting, FSTAB, this kind of stuff that most people don't know about.

868
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,900
Scott: Yeah, but it's standard Linux-y stuff, right?

869
00:47:20,941 --> 00:47:21,774
Scott: It's not that weird.

870
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:28,140
Rym: But to set up NFS, if you're just a kind of not super technical person, you're not even going to know where to start.

871
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,620
Scott: Ubuntu has some good documentations.

872
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:31,643
Rym: No, I guess Ubuntu.

873
00:47:31,664 --> 00:47:33,677
Rym: I guess I haven't set up NFS on a non like...

874
00:47:34,382 --> 00:47:35,957
Scott: You still have to hit the command line, right?

875
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:37,280
Scott: It's not going to...

876
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,420
Rym: Yeah, but two, if you set up NFS wrong, you know, synchronous versus asynchronous, the options...

877
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,479
Scott: I was just about to go into that.

878
00:47:42,921 --> 00:47:46,100
Rym: And the other computer goes down, you're fucked.

879
00:47:46,721 --> 00:47:47,719
Rym: You are so fucked.

880
00:47:48,021 --> 00:47:49,720
Rym: Your NFS mount will just hang.

881
00:47:49,941 --> 00:47:50,540
Scott: That's right.

882
00:47:50,722 --> 00:47:52,339
Rym: And there's almost no way to fix that.

883
00:47:52,983 --> 00:47:54,620
Rym: You'll get like a zombie process.

884
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:55,520
Rym: You got to reboot.

885
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:57,759
Scott: Yeah, so it's basically it works.

886
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:01,720
Scott: It's simple, but it's unreliable and can get really shaky, right?

887
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,460
Scott: This synchronous mode and this asynchronous mode.

888
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:12,680
Scott: The synchronous mode is like, look, whenever I write a file, whenever I do something, wait till that finishes before you do the next thing.

889
00:48:13,062 --> 00:48:16,300
Scott: That way, the hard drive is always in a good way, right?

890
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:19,560
Scott: We won't like write half a file and fail to write the rest of it.

891
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:20,960
Scott: If something happens to the network, right?

892
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:27,320
Scott: I mean, when you have a computer with a hard drive in it, you're pretty much like going to assume, OK, serial ATA bus isn't going to fail.

893
00:48:27,421 --> 00:48:28,440
Scott: It's really reliable.

894
00:48:28,681 --> 00:48:31,460
Scott: It's basically 100 percent reliable for all intents and purposes.

895
00:48:32,001 --> 00:48:35,420
Scott: Maybe your raid card might go down, but it's not going to like flake out.

896
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:38,460
Scott: Networks will continue to work, but get flaky.

897
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:39,520
Scott: You might drop a packet.

898
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,920
Scott: Well, what if I drop a packet when I'm sending a file over?

899
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,855
Scott: Well, I hope you were in synchronous mode, right?

900
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,080
Scott: Otherwise, your file is now fucked up on the other end of the line.

901
00:48:48,282 --> 00:48:53,060
Scott: Uh, but if you're in the thing with synchronous mode is that it's mad slow.

902
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,600
Scott: And if a lot of people are using the same NFS, it's even more slow.

903
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:03,018
Scott: It's ultra slow, mega slow, almost unusably slow if there's a lot going on.

904
00:49:03,861 --> 00:49:11,540
Rym: And if that's also, you know, it's like Scott said, it's easy to set up, but you really have to tweak it if you want to use it in any sort of performing way.

905
00:49:11,862 --> 00:49:14,980
Rym: And to nobody but other Linux boxes are going to connect.

906
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,060
Rym: I mean, at least Linux being open, you know, you can install Samba.

907
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,480
Scott: I'm sure you can buy crazy software that I was about to say Windows.

908
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,220
Rym: There is software that gets NFS to work on Windows.

909
00:49:24,623 --> 00:49:25,898
Rym: But last I used it.

910
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:26,702
Scott: Fuck that shit.

911
00:49:27,485 --> 00:49:31,880
Rym: It is 10 years behind Samba on Linux.

912
00:49:32,121 --> 00:49:32,523
Rym: Yeah.

913
00:49:32,724 --> 00:49:35,239
Scott: So and it costs money and I've never seen it for free.

914
00:49:35,541 --> 00:49:36,630
Rym: I've seen some for free.

915
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:37,920
Rym: I used it at RIT, actually.

916
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:38,324
Scott: Really?

917
00:49:38,789 --> 00:49:39,660
Rym: It didn't work so well.

918
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:40,202
Scott: No kidding.

919
00:49:40,322 --> 00:49:44,940
Rym: So if you look at Samba and think, I want to try what Samba was like.

920
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,619
Rym: Like 10 years ago, try getting NFS to work on a Windows PC.

921
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:50,520
Scott: Now, the asynchronous mode is pretty much the opposite.

922
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:53,760
Scott: It's like, oh, it's crazy fast and everything just sort of goes.

923
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:58,440
Scott: And I actually use the asynchronous mode because it's pretty reliable on a small, tiny land.

924
00:49:58,581 --> 00:50:01,620
Scott: You know, you only got one guy mounting using it at a time and I could have trouble.

925
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:05,620
Scott: But what if some weird stuff happens, like the network flakes out?

926
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:08,140
Scott: You got mad corrupt files and NFS doesn't even care.

927
00:50:08,221 --> 00:50:09,340
Scott: You might just ruin the whole thing.

928
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:10,329
Scott: Who knows what can happen?

929
00:50:10,349 --> 00:50:11,459
Scott: because it just doesn't care.

930
00:50:11,861 --> 00:50:17,327
Scott: It just sends the files back and forth as it willy nilly and just trust that everything coming out of the line is right.

931
00:50:17,387 --> 00:50:19,460
Scott: Sometimes you'll save something to be broken.

932
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:20,384
Scott: You got to save it again.

933
00:50:20,847 --> 00:50:25,111
Scott: You know, that's why I keep copies of stuff on the local hard drive and the NAS and maybe the cloud.

934
00:50:25,132 --> 00:50:26,158
Scott: and you know, because you never know.

935
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:27,622
Scott: It's not true.

936
00:50:27,783 --> 00:50:40,940
Scott: And you've even seen if you really want NFS to work properly, you have to configure all sorts of weird stuff like, you know, like chunk sizes of how many bits do you send per packet at once and how much do you buffer up on either end?

937
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:45,140
Scott: You need to actually configure all these crazy numbers to get the optimal performance.

938
00:50:45,724 --> 00:50:46,699
Scott: And it's really not worth it.

939
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:53,720
Scott: So most people leave the defaults, which work, but you're going to get some slowness if you ever try to do anything remotely serious.

940
00:50:54,361 --> 00:51:05,219
Rym: Now, it is nice that, you know, Windows network file sharing works pretty much as well as you're going to get it to work out of the box without you having to do anything other than set up the permissions.

941
00:51:06,241 --> 00:51:13,979
Rym: And it really only gets complicated when you try to set up like a domain with like security policies and, you know, what's allowed to be shared and what isn't.

942
00:51:14,341 --> 00:51:16,900
Rym: You're trying to do authentication across multiple devices.

943
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:17,381
Scott: Yeah.

944
00:51:17,401 --> 00:51:22,339
Scott: I want the accounting department to be able to read and write these Excel files, but I don't want them to see anything else.

945
00:51:22,661 --> 00:51:27,080
Scott: But I want the auditors need to be able to read the Excel files, but can't read them.

946
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,440
Scott: And then I need you know, it's like, oh, my God, kill yourself.

947
00:51:29,741 --> 00:51:38,360
Rym: And all the problems with SMB and CFS really come down to devices that aren't Windows operating systems tend to implement poorly.

948
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:45,701
Rym: And the logs and documentation around problems are difficult for most people to follow.

949
00:51:45,722 --> 00:51:50,504
Rym: NFS is deeply documented and difficult to follow for the exact opposite reason.

950
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,360
Rym: There's too much low level documentation.

951
00:51:55,624 --> 00:52:01,900
Rym: And I don't know, NFS just kind of sucks in the modern era, but we're forced to use it because there isn't really much better for that exact purpose.

952
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:05,140
Scott: I want to take a side note here to talk about something called Fuse, right?

953
00:52:05,281 --> 00:52:12,439
Scott: So Fuse is a relatively new thing, a few years old, and it's a. it's a Linux thing primarily, not even just general Unix, just mostly Linux.

954
00:52:13,362 --> 00:52:16,280
Scott: But I have seen it on OS X, so I guess it's Unix in general.

955
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:19,099
Scott: But what it is, is it's F-U-S-E.

956
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,585
Scott: I think it's like the.

957
00:52:20,605 --> 00:52:26,498
Scott: I forget what the F stands for, but it's basically like user mounted file system, like something like that.

958
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:28,827
Scott: Is it like full?

959
00:52:28,887 --> 00:52:29,754
Scott: I forget the exact.

960
00:52:29,976 --> 00:52:30,520
Scott: you can look it up.

961
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:32,220
Scott: I don't remember, but it's basically allowed.

962
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:32,661
Scott: Right.

963
00:52:32,681 --> 00:52:34,559
Scott: So the main problem is on a Unix machine.

964
00:52:35,103 --> 00:52:38,460
Scott: You know, only root really has permissions to mount file systems.

965
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:39,061
Scott: Right.

966
00:52:39,603 --> 00:52:46,580
Scott: But sometimes one user, just a regular old user, has legitimate reason to mount a file system, perhaps in their home directory.

967
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:59,419
Scott: For example, I might SSH to another computer where I have access to files and it'll be really nice and convenient if I could mount that remote computer that I have SSH to as a local folder instead of using SCP and SFTP.

968
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:04,763
Scott: I could just use CP and MV and all those normal file system commands by mounting that locally.

969
00:53:05,347 --> 00:53:07,160
Scott: Now, there are some permissions issues, right?

970
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:16,560
Scott: Because if I'm mounting something with SSH locally, then my local user account needs to be the only account that has permissions on that folder.

971
00:53:17,201 --> 00:53:20,600
Scott: But on the remote machine, the permissions are totally different.

972
00:53:21,022 --> 00:53:21,263
Scott: Right.

973
00:53:21,283 --> 00:53:24,260
Scott: Because it's what are the accounts on that machine I'm SSHing to?

974
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:25,920
Scott: Totally different from the ones I have.

975
00:53:26,341 --> 00:53:38,160
Scott: So the chmod's and the chown's and various file system things on the local machine that I'm on need to be translated and different when they're sent over the wire or received over the wire from the remote file system.

976
00:53:38,541 --> 00:53:38,701
Scott: Right.

977
00:53:39,504 --> 00:53:47,460
Scott: But basically Fuse is this kernel module and sort of user space system that allows you to do to mount almost anything.

978
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:47,801
Scott: Right.

979
00:53:47,922 --> 00:53:53,221
Scott: You could mount like, you know, you could turn anything and turn it into a file system.

980
00:53:53,262 --> 00:54:01,620
Scott: You could have like I'm going to turn that website into a file system and you could write some sort of driver that's like, OK, you mount the website.

981
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:09,240
Scott: And if you can't, if you you know, if you open up the file at home, then it'll you'll get the HTML for the index that HTML.

982
00:54:09,562 --> 00:54:11,640
Scott: And if you you know, it's like you can turn anything.

983
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:24,019
Scott: It basically turns the file system into a user interface for anything because you can turn you know, you just write a file system driver that maps to any API, any any computerized thing in the world.

984
00:54:24,723 --> 00:54:35,199
Scott: You could make like a video game that was in the form of a file system where like this one file and you open it up and it gives the instructions and then you create a file and that creates an item in your inventory and stuff like that.

985
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:39,965
Scott: And all the while that's communicating with like a database somewhere with the game data in it.

986
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:41,519
Scott: It's totally cool.

987
00:54:42,121 --> 00:54:46,762
Scott: And you should try to, you know, see all the crazy, crazy cool things people have been able to mount.

988
00:54:46,802 --> 00:54:54,240
Scott: Like you can mount your friggin scanner and, you know, when you scan something, a JPEG appears in that folder and then you read it out.

989
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,520
Scott: That kind of stuff works weird.

990
00:54:58,783 --> 00:55:02,342
Rym: Now, one thing we didn't really talk about, you know, with NFS versus SMB, we kind of hinted on.

991
00:55:02,362 --> 00:55:10,288
Rym: we were talking about SMB, but with Windows file sharing, you know, home groups and work groups and, you know, I guess Windows servers don't really exist anymore.

992
00:55:10,328 --> 00:55:11,899
Scott: I hope I hope you're not using one of those.

993
00:55:12,622 --> 00:55:13,409
Rym: I've set those up.

994
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:14,298
Scott: I have pity for you.

995
00:55:16,142 --> 00:55:29,880
Rym: But the I think the biggest, biggest reason why Windows file sharing is so much better than the default in Linux is that it's pretty much self-organizing, like in a typical setup, like in a house, it's one flat network.

996
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:36,500
Rym: And even with the switch, all the PCs are going to find each other and you'll just kind of see all the other things you can mount on the network.

997
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:37,343
Scott: It's the same way.

998
00:55:37,383 --> 00:55:42,720
Scott: the OSX file sharing uses Bonjour to find all the other Macs in the local area automatically.

999
00:55:43,261 --> 00:55:43,543
Rym: Right.

1000
00:55:43,804 --> 00:55:46,359
Scott: You know, with Linux, you have to type in the IPs of the other guys.

1001
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:47,739
Rym: NFS, you have to type, not a host name.

1002
00:55:48,482 --> 00:55:50,000
Rym: No, you don't want to use a host name.

1003
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:51,680
Rym: You don't want DNS look ups for that shit.

1004
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:54,740
Scott: No, you got to type in the IP address of all the other computers.

1005
00:55:55,001 --> 00:55:58,480
Scott: It's not just going to look around and find NFS shares on your network.

1006
00:55:58,882 --> 00:56:01,860
Rym: Now you could set up some startup scripts that did some stuff.

1007
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:07,740
Rym: There are ways to make automated NFS mounts, but that's complicated and annoying.

1008
00:56:07,921 --> 00:56:08,859
Rym: It doesn't self-organize.

1009
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:10,459
Scott: It will often fail.

1010
00:56:10,881 --> 00:56:13,059
Scott: And then what do you do?

1011
00:56:14,702 --> 00:56:17,620
Rym: So we talked, you know, these are like remote mounted file systems.

1012
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,520
Rym: There's files somewhere.

1013
00:56:18,661 --> 00:56:22,260
Rym: I want to mount those locally to access them, to read or write.

1014
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:31,300
Rym: And one thing I found is that most people try to set this up, mostly on Linux, more so than Windows, because Windows, they do it to like, literally, I want to give a guy files.

1015
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:32,960
Rym: I want to get some files from some other device.

1016
00:56:34,081 --> 00:56:36,820
Rym: I've found people use it on Linux to do dumb shit.

1017
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,080
Rym: Like they want it.

1018
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:45,060
Rym: One, they'll use NFS to like mount their home directory remotely in Linux, which doesn't really work nearly as well as the Windows equivalent.

1019
00:56:45,742 --> 00:56:48,260
Rym: There are so many problems and things can go wrong.

1020
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:51,639
Rym: Like if you try to log in and your home directory isn't there.

1021
00:56:52,941 --> 00:56:55,339
Rym: Linux does not handle that nearly as well as Windows does.

1022
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:56,361
Scott: I know.

1023
00:56:56,401 --> 00:56:56,702
Scott: Right.

1024
00:56:57,645 --> 00:57:09,860
Rym: But what if we want to, you know, what if I'm like, what if I'm mounting a file system remotely because there's log files written there and I want to like have a thing that grips those log files to generate an alarm?

1025
00:57:10,401 --> 00:57:12,760
Scott: Why don't you just have the gripper run on the log file?

1026
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:14,923
Scott: Yeah.

1027
00:57:14,943 --> 00:57:19,720
Rym: Or why don't you use syslog to send the relevant logs to all the places?

1028
00:57:20,702 --> 00:57:22,259
Rym: Why not the whole file system?

1029
00:57:22,701 --> 00:57:23,123
Scott: That's right.

1030
00:57:23,284 --> 00:57:26,140
Rym: When all you need to do is send the individual log lines that matter.

1031
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:30,659
Rym: Syslog, in fact, will send the logs you need to the places you need them and not send all the bullshit.

1032
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,000
Scott: That's how I have it set up at work.

1033
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:37,485
Scott: I have one server and that all the other servers have syslog configured to send their logs to that one server.

1034
00:57:37,506 --> 00:57:40,964
Scott: So if I want to see logs, I go to that one server and look at the logs and you know what?

1035
00:57:41,287 --> 00:57:42,860
Scott: They're all in one big log file.

1036
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:45,680
Scott: So it's like, oh, my God, all the varlog messages are mixed up together.

1037
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:51,525
Scott: But actually, I can just grep and filter that down in one second to just the one machine I care about.

1038
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:52,900
Rym: Or I go one step further.

1039
00:57:53,501 --> 00:58:00,420
Rym: The logs are written to their local systems and they're archived to, you know, with syslog to some remote system for archive purposes.

1040
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:04,768
Rym: You know, one of the biggest problems in Linux is that the log files get gigantic because people are stupid.

1041
00:58:04,809 --> 00:58:05,740
Scott: Well, I got rotation.

1042
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:07,279
Rym: Yeah, most people don't set that up.

1043
00:58:07,501 --> 00:58:10,000
Scott: It's default, at least on a modern distribution.

1044
00:58:10,181 --> 00:58:16,283
Rym: Not most people don't because they'll install like some software that logs to like its own place.

1045
00:58:16,745 --> 00:58:19,720
Scott: And this is why people say, oh, you got to mount var in a different partition.

1046
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:20,810
Rym: You do need to.

1047
00:58:21,013 --> 00:58:21,520
Rym: You should.

1048
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:22,504
Rym: People don't.

1049
00:58:23,269 --> 00:58:24,880
Rym: But what I do is one step further.

1050
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:26,097
Rym: The logs are written somewhere else.

1051
00:58:26,561 --> 00:58:43,240
Rym: They're syslogged for archival purposes with rotation out of the way, but their agents grepping those logs and they only send to a central location logs, log lines that mean a human has to do something like, hey, error was written because shit went down.

1052
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,460
Scott: None of this has to involve any sort of network file system mounting.

1053
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:46,960
Rym: Yes.

1054
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:54,940
Rym: So any time you need to mount a file system from somewhere else, step back and think, what do I need from that file system?

1055
00:58:55,361 --> 00:59:03,039
Rym: And if your only answer is this is the fastest way to do what I want to do, you're probably going about this the wrong way.

1056
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:08,100
Scott: Yeah, it's usually, you know, it's a tool that can solve a lot of problems.

1057
00:59:08,522 --> 00:59:10,530
Scott: And a very bad and problematic way.

1058
00:59:10,571 --> 00:59:19,503
Scott: that will also cause problems like look at when they're usually most of the time there is a better solution besides a file share and a file server.

1059
00:59:19,523 --> 00:59:22,400
Rym: And well, not even just let's go once people don't do it.

1060
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:38,739
Rym: The way most people use Samba is they navigate from the network to some share to get some files very different from even though it's the exact same underlying technology going to your computer and being like mount network drive and mounting some remote location as like the you drive.

1061
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:43,260
Rym: Yeah, you usually don't need to do that in Linux is even worse.

1062
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,659
Rym: Mounting a file system is the last thing you want to do.

1063
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:50,659
Rym: So one level up from that, you know, let's do it at a higher level.

1064
00:59:51,241 --> 00:59:59,420
Rym: Tools like our sync, our sync can probably do what you're trying to do without mounting a stupid file system, especially if everyone has a lot of hard drive space.

1065
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:03,740
Scott: Our sync is a great idea, you know, because you could just, hey, let's synchronize.

1066
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:05,880
Scott: Now we've got plenty of copies of the files all around.

1067
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:10,782
Rym: You can configure our sync to send something and then delete whatever happened on my local machine.

1068
01:00:10,963 --> 01:00:13,820
Scott: You can do crazy stuff even better than our sync for a lot of things.

1069
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:16,580
Scott: If they're files that are edited frequently, like our sync is good.

1070
01:00:16,721 --> 01:00:19,600
Scott: If let's say you have a folder full of videos, let's say your video editors.

1071
01:00:19,761 --> 01:00:20,002
Scott: Right.

1072
01:00:20,384 --> 01:00:20,745
Scott: And you have.

1073
01:00:20,946 --> 01:00:24,442
Scott: you have someone's dumping in new source material into this big folder.

1074
01:00:24,944 --> 01:00:30,159
Scott: You can use our sync and you basically get all the latest source material, you know, synchronized locally to you.

1075
01:00:30,362 --> 01:00:31,360
Scott: And that's awesomeness.

1076
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:35,361
Scott: Our sync is also and if someone and if some old source material got updated, you get that update.

1077
01:00:35,461 --> 01:00:45,280
Rym: It's also pretty good for the distribution of simple, not often reread configuration files like NTP configuration updates.

1078
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:46,001
Rym: Right.

1079
01:00:46,403 --> 01:00:59,939
Scott: But let's say that you've got something that's edited a whole bunch, like, hey, this is the Excel document we're working on, then it's probably not the greatest idea to use our sync, because then, you know, you get all these too many people are syncing too frequently and it gets all broken.

1080
01:01:00,301 --> 01:01:03,833
Rym: Or are syncing like rapidly written to log files.

1081
01:01:04,515 --> 01:01:07,346
Rym: that again, you're doing something wrong.

1082
01:01:07,366 --> 01:01:14,639
Scott: But the thing is, even network mounting will give you problems depending because you get the situations where like, oh, you know, a guy made changes and saved it.

1083
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,300
Scott: I loaded before he saved.

1084
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:17,799
Scott: Now I saved on top of his save.

1085
01:01:18,262 --> 01:01:21,920
Scott: And I think Windows, if you use Office, has stuff to fight against this problem.

1086
01:01:22,401 --> 01:01:29,862
Scott: But other than that, you're going to you're going to have problems where a guy does work, saves it onto the network share and someone else saves on top of him and undoes his work.

1087
01:01:30,505 --> 01:01:32,920
Scott: And in that kind of situation, you need Git.

1088
01:01:33,821 --> 01:01:38,560
Scott: Git is that problem solver and the network share alone does not solve that.

1089
01:01:39,123 --> 01:01:41,320
Rym: Now, at the same time, you can go lower.

1090
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:51,019
Rym: I mean, instead of mounting a remote file system, you can use a shared file system or something like DRBD, which I bring up every now and then because I'm a fan of it.

1091
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:51,883
Scott: It's weird.

1092
01:01:51,903 --> 01:01:52,997
Scott: It's mad dangerous, yo.

1093
01:01:53,481 --> 01:01:55,179
Rym: It's dangerous if you don't understand it.

1094
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:55,986
Scott: It's hard.

1095
01:01:56,047 --> 01:01:56,900
Rym: It's like a lightsaber.

1096
01:01:57,242 --> 01:02:00,039
Rym: So basically what this is, it will kill you unless you know how to use it.

1097
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:01,136
Scott: So imagine this.

1098
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:02,423
Scott: Imagine this.

1099
01:02:02,483 --> 01:02:05,920
Scott: I've got a bunch of servers and I've got my let's say not even have servers.

1100
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:06,960
Scott: I got like three computers.

1101
01:02:07,201 --> 01:02:07,423
Scott: Right.

1102
01:02:08,006 --> 01:02:10,059
Scott: And all these computers have one hard drive each.

1103
01:02:11,161 --> 01:02:13,219
Scott: Now they could just use that hard drive straight up.

1104
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:16,860
Scott: But, you know, I want all three computers to be identical.

1105
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:17,744
Rym: Now let's back up.

1106
01:02:17,844 --> 01:02:21,664
Rym: Let's say I'm on one computer with three hard drives and I want them to be identical.

1107
01:02:21,724 --> 01:02:23,960
Rym: Well, I make a sort of like nerd raid.

1108
01:02:24,281 --> 01:02:24,481
Rym: Yeah.

1109
01:02:24,742 --> 01:02:32,518
Rym: So DRBD is basically raid where the disks are on multiple computers and it only does mirroring.

1110
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:33,281
Scott: That's right.

1111
01:02:33,322 --> 01:02:41,079
Scott: So I have three computers and I DRBD them all and all those computers over the network connect to the DRBD.

1112
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:47,220
Scott: So each computer has and one thinks to itself that it has a real hard drive in it.

1113
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,760
Scott: It doesn't even know that it's this network mount situation.

1114
01:02:50,404 --> 01:02:52,440
Scott: It only sees a real hard drive.

1115
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,517
Scott: It doesn't understand that is networked.

1116
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:55,161
Scott: Right.

1117
01:02:55,181 --> 01:02:58,642
Scott: I mean, on the low level, it does, but on the higher level, it just regular hard drive.

1118
01:02:59,004 --> 01:03:01,740
Scott: But that hard drive happens to be a magic network hard drive.

1119
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:05,760
Scott: That's actually three hard drives wide on three different computers.

1120
01:03:05,861 --> 01:03:09,500
Scott: So sitting down at any one of those computers, you'll see the exact same thing.

1121
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:13,360
Scott: And if I edit the file on one computer on computer number two, suddenly the files edited.

1122
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:14,111
Scott: You're like, what?

1123
01:03:14,131 --> 01:03:14,539
Rym: What now?

1124
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:18,476
Rym: What the contention for, you know, who gets to edit a file?

1125
01:03:18,496 --> 01:03:22,200
Rym: and all that stuff is handled by the file system, which has nothing to do with DRBD.

1126
01:03:22,341 --> 01:03:24,300
Rym: DRBD is just at the block level.

1127
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,900
Rym: The hard drive itself is basic.

1128
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:31,160
Rym: Think of it as like a physical replica of the actual block device.

1129
01:03:31,381 --> 01:03:32,980
Scott: It's even below the file system.

1130
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:33,401
Scott: Right.

1131
01:03:33,462 --> 01:03:36,300
Scott: Like NFS is a networked file system.

1132
01:03:36,761 --> 01:03:36,862
Scott: Right.

1133
01:03:36,903 --> 01:03:38,520
Scott: Ext three is a file system.

1134
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,159
Scott: Riser FS is a file system.

1135
01:03:41,404 --> 01:03:42,459
Scott: What's the Windows one?

1136
01:03:42,801 --> 01:03:43,250
Rym: SMB CFS.

1137
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:46,177
Scott: No, at the end and whatever it is.

1138
01:03:46,601 --> 01:03:47,619
Rym: Oh, NTFS.

1139
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:49,236
Scott: Yeah, NTFS derp derp.

1140
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:51,900
Rym: Well, CFS common Internet file system.

1141
01:03:52,623 --> 01:03:53,517
Scott: NTFS is a file system.

1142
01:03:54,321 --> 01:03:55,880
Scott: DRBD is not a file system.

1143
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,899
Scott: You could use the RBD and format it with NTFS.

1144
01:03:59,243 --> 01:03:59,729
Scott: It would work.

1145
01:03:59,911 --> 01:04:00,457
Scott: You could do that.

1146
01:04:01,201 --> 01:04:04,500
Scott: You could take a DRBD and then use NFS on that shit.

1147
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:05,386
Scott: It totally work.

1148
01:04:05,628 --> 01:04:07,160
Rym: Now, where do I use this sort of solution?

1149
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:08,740
Rym: Well, we talked about log files.

1150
01:04:09,041 --> 01:04:11,760
Rym: What if I'm trying to do high availability with a database?

1151
01:04:12,541 --> 01:04:18,537
Rym: And the way some databases, most databases work is that when you make a transaction, it is written to a log.

1152
01:04:19,201 --> 01:04:21,660
Rym: Some file systems do their own sort of transactional logging.

1153
01:04:21,741 --> 01:04:24,540
Rym: You know, journaling, a journalized file system.

1154
01:04:25,202 --> 01:04:28,600
Rym: So the transaction is written to this log, which is a file.

1155
01:04:29,201 --> 01:04:31,610
Rym: And then that way the database can maintain.

1156
01:04:31,751 --> 01:04:35,685
Rym: if I do a select somewhere else before that transaction that's changing.

1157
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:40,202
Rym: the database is completed, I see the database before that transaction.

1158
01:04:40,724 --> 01:04:48,340
Rym: But if I'm doing the operations, you know, I've made my own lock, then I personally, where I'm doing the changes, will see the changes I've made.

1159
01:04:48,783 --> 01:04:51,039
Rym: And then once I commit those changes, everyone else sees them.

1160
01:04:51,561 --> 01:05:00,260
Rym: So if I want to replicate that database, I want to in real time take that transaction log and have it be on my backup server at the same time.

1161
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:05,140
Rym: So I need very low level, perfectly reliable, like block device, DRBD style stuff.

1162
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:07,620
Scott: Now, sometimes it's the wrong answer for a database, right?

1163
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:13,380
Scott: You could just use the database is built in master slave kind of set up, which is like Cassandra or Sloane.

1164
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:16,559
Scott: Cassandra is is a totally is a totally different purpose.

1165
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:17,361
Scott: Right.

1166
01:05:17,402 --> 01:05:17,583
Scott: Yeah.

1167
01:05:17,603 --> 01:05:19,520
Scott: But I mean, MySQL, Postgres, Oracle.

1168
01:05:19,601 --> 01:05:21,920
Rym: MySQL has some shitty binary replication.

1169
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:23,040
Scott: Well, but it works, right?

1170
01:05:23,261 --> 01:05:23,899
Rym: Yeah, it's shitty, but it works.

1171
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:26,500
Rym: I'm just saying, but Postgres has pretty good binary replication.

1172
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:30,482
Scott: But the point is, you know, everyone's got this master slave replication, which totally works.

1173
01:05:30,803 --> 01:05:34,660
Scott: But with DRBD, you could basically get master, master, master, master.

1174
01:05:34,781 --> 01:05:37,260
Scott: And it doesn't even matter if you have it configured properly.

1175
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:38,740
Rym: You can still run into problems.

1176
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:39,700
Rym: Don't don't get us wrong.

1177
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:40,542
Scott: Oh, absolutely.

1178
01:05:40,562 --> 01:05:49,223
Scott: But if it's a transactional, properly ACID compliant database and the DRBD is configured properly and the network's fast enough and all that stuff, it could totally work.

1179
01:05:49,323 --> 01:05:51,220
Rym: The moral of all of this is as such.

1180
01:05:51,500 --> 01:06:00,460
Rym: One from a user level, Windows style file sharing for most people is pretty much the best because it just works if you run in any if you do it right.

1181
01:06:00,741 --> 01:06:04,420
Scott: But most people don't do it right, which means it's like it's weird, like it just works.

1182
01:06:04,822 --> 01:06:07,479
Scott: But for 90 percent of people actually doesn't just work as they fuck it up.

1183
01:06:08,222 --> 01:06:08,906
Scott: I don't know what it is.

1184
01:06:08,926 --> 01:06:15,460
Scott: I think it's the user interface of it just like encourages people to do the wrong thing because it abstracts it a little too much.

1185
01:06:15,721 --> 01:06:16,002
Scott: Yeah.

1186
01:06:16,524 --> 01:06:21,947
Rym: NFS, you have to understand exactly what you're doing to make it work, which is why it works all the time.

1187
01:06:22,007 --> 01:06:23,720
Rym: But you have to understand what you're doing.

1188
01:06:24,122 --> 01:06:27,020
Rym: So it's outside of the realm of people who aren't super computer anyway.

1189
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:28,625
Scott: Yeah.

1190
01:06:28,645 --> 01:06:33,784
Rym: And most people, even if you're doing a mount like this, there's a level higher and a level lower.

1191
01:06:34,446 --> 01:06:38,140
Rym: And usually the solution to your problem is up or down in the middle.

1192
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:39,740
Scott: Fuse is the higher level.

1193
01:06:39,881 --> 01:06:46,060
Scott: And then, you know, actual applications like, you know, the master slave in your database or get or something like that are the higher level.

1194
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:51,516
Scott: And the lower level is DRV or even a SAN or some kind of hardware device or who knows what else.

1195
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:51,921
Rym: Yeah.

1196
01:06:52,042 --> 01:06:54,300
Rym: You know, there was a way with old SCSI, right?

1197
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:56,760
Rym: You could have a SCSI card, right?

1198
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:57,939
Rym: It has an idea of like one.

1199
01:06:58,381 --> 01:07:05,099
Rym: You have a hard drive at like two, a hard drive at three, another fucking computer at four that has access to the same SCSI bus.

1200
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,044
Scott: You could do this.

1201
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:08,820
Rym: I don't know if anyone ever did that, but you could.

1202
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:14,240
Scott: I'm sure someone did that back in the day when they bought like a one gigabyte hard drive for like a thousand dollars.

1203
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:19,939
Scott: And then, you know, everyone connected to it like a big scuzzy daisy chain going down the row of computers.

1204
01:07:21,142 --> 01:07:21,939
Scott: Sure, someone did that.

1205
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:22,361
Rym: Yep.

1206
01:07:23,023 --> 01:07:26,920
Rym: Notice we didn't talk about how the protocols work because that's boring shit.

1207
01:07:27,601 --> 01:07:32,038
Scott: And you could look it up online and I don't even know it off the top of my head because I would just look it up online.

1208
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:36,660
Rym: I know NFS pretty well because at RIT, you know, talk about IT education.

1209
01:07:37,201 --> 01:07:41,437
Rym: We had take a whole class where we learned about the deep down bullshit of X2.

1210
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:53,534
Rym: X3, like exactly how the journal worked, SMB, NFS and that Mac, whatever the old Mac sharing protocol, even for you, what it was.

1211
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,740
Rym: Remember Mac had its own like file sharing protocol?

1212
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,939
Scott: Well, they still you know, nowadays they still do.

1213
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:05,324
Scott: Mac actually sort of is new, sort of like wanted to compete with Dropbox kind of iCloud thing.

1214
01:08:05,364 --> 01:08:12,260
Scott: But they also in the same process updated in the finder, like the thing that shares between Macs and uses Bonjour and whatever.

1215
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:13,223
Scott: And it's kind of weird.

1216
01:08:13,323 --> 01:08:21,279
Scott: But if you have Macs, all Macs and you just want to share between those, then use that because it'll totally work the same way as the Windows one.

1217
01:08:21,319 --> 01:08:22,920
Scott: It'll actually be even easier.

1218
01:08:23,779 --> 01:08:28,580
Rym: And Macs, pretty much my experience with connecting them to Windows shares is I try it.

1219
01:08:28,961 --> 01:08:32,800
Rym: It'll either just work immediately or I'll never really get it to work.

1220
01:08:32,961 --> 01:08:33,224
Rym: And there's.

1221
01:08:33,264 --> 01:08:34,799
Rym: no I can't figure out why.

1222
01:08:35,001 --> 01:08:36,540
Scott: Because they hide all the buttons and switches.

1223
01:08:37,183 --> 01:08:38,720
Scott: All you can really do is try the default.

1224
01:08:39,103 --> 01:08:41,140
Scott: And if the default doesn't work, there's no other buttons to press.

1225
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:41,867
Scott: You don't have to do.

1226
01:08:41,886 --> 01:08:43,100
Rym: I don't know if they fixed it.

1227
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:47,341
Rym: But the last problem I had was if I had an anonymous share, I want anyone to be able to connect it.

1228
01:08:47,825 --> 01:08:50,660
Scott: No authentication keeps asking for user and password anyway.

1229
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:57,920
Rym: So I'd eventually have to set up a password just for the Mac, even though everyone else and even even trying to use like guest guest doesn't work.

1230
01:08:58,040 --> 01:08:58,750
Scott: It has to be a real account.

1231
01:08:58,770 --> 01:08:59,359
Scott: I don't know, whatever.

1232
01:08:59,520 --> 01:08:59,761
Scott: Yeah.

1233
01:09:00,404 --> 01:09:04,349
Rym: And the thing is, we probably could have figured it out if we, you know, did some research and tried.

1234
01:09:04,410 --> 01:09:05,279
Rym: But fuck that noise.

1235
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:05,724
Scott: That's right.

1236
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:07,219
Rym: We're too old for research.

1237
01:09:07,705 --> 01:09:08,880
Scott: I'm sort of getting real hungry.

1238
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:09,359
Scott: Let's go.

1239
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:09,781
Rym: OK, we're done.

1240
01:09:15,707 --> 01:09:17,850
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1241
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:23,153
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1242
01:09:23,354 --> 01:09:28,415
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

1243
01:09:28,656 --> 01:09:31,330
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1244
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:36,050
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1246
01:09:40,832 --> 01:09:43,890
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1247
01:09:44,170 --> 01:09:47,010
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
