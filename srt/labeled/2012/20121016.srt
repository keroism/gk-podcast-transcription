1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,613
Rym: Hey, it's Tuesday, October 16th, 2012.

2
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:13,194
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,395 --> 00:00:23,058
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight Genoa the traitors of Let's do this.

4
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:30,594
Rym: So I found the secret to beating FTL pretty much 90% of the time.

5
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:31,356
Rym: cheating on easy.

6
00:00:31,376 --> 00:00:35,490
Rym: cheating on easy Just like fucking max out your shield.

7
00:00:35,511 --> 00:00:37,080
Rym: just go for it like you can't lose.

8
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:40,955
Scott: I've gotten to the boss of max shields four or five times.

9
00:00:41,016 --> 00:00:41,378
Scott: I know what.

10
00:00:41,418 --> 00:00:41,880
Rym: no weapons.

11
00:00:42,262 --> 00:00:44,773
Scott: I had plenty of weapons and I was still unable to beat the boss.

12
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:46,220
Rym: the saddest thing that ever happened to me.

13
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,396
Rym: Those like I've never won using like the crew teleporter II thing.

14
00:00:50,436 --> 00:00:51,400
Rym: I only really tried to do.

15
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,880
Scott: I've only recently learned how to use that without fucking yourself.

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,315
Scott: But the problem with it is is you fuck up once with it and you're done.

17
00:00:57,335 --> 00:00:58,984
Rym: It's how you're like, all right I've got one dude.

18
00:00:59,064 --> 00:01:00,090
Scott: It's like I got really.

19
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,720
Scott: I finally got really good at using it.

20
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,060
Scott: I leveled it up and everything and I was going in and I had I had you know mantises and rock men to attack with.

21
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,148
Scott: So I'm sending them over and beating them up.

22
00:01:09,228 --> 00:01:12,320
Scott: I'm destroying ships without killing, you know with only killing the cruise.

23
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,450
Rym: Yeah, I've been doing that mostly with the oxygen.

24
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,740
Rym: like I'll just I unblast the oxygen until they die.

25
00:01:17,424 --> 00:01:19,840
Scott: That doesn't even work for me because they just keep fucking repairing it.

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,931
Scott: I need to actually kill their people so that they can't repair the.

27
00:01:22,971 --> 00:01:25,521
Rym: I have killed many a ship just by letting the oxygen run Out.

28
00:01:25,702 --> 00:01:26,625
Scott: I've tried that.

29
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:29,517
Scott: just shoot ion at the oxygen and wait with such defense.

30
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:30,200
Scott: They can't hurt me.

31
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,859
Scott: Thanks a while, but it works and they just repair it as fast as I shoot it.

32
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:38,320
Rym: If you keep shooting you'll kill the guys in there and not with ion can use like a bomb.

33
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,413
Scott: But if I shoot it with any weapon bombs don't damage the hull.

34
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:42,920
Scott: I got to get a bomb.

35
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,512
Rym: Yes, I get a bomb again.

36
00:01:44,532 --> 00:01:45,519
Scott: You had to use the missiles.

37
00:01:46,562 --> 00:01:49,260
Rym: Then I gotta get four gameboys and I gotta get four links.

38
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:52,995
Scott: I can never seem to get the stuff that I you know into.

39
00:01:53,075 --> 00:01:56,148
Scott: it's like for example one game I played and I was the Engi ships.

40
00:01:56,168 --> 00:01:57,373
Scott: you start with the drone, right?

41
00:01:57,695 --> 00:02:02,130
Scott: Oh, yeah, and then at the first Shop there's another anti-ship drone.

42
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,395
Rym: Yeah, I ship drones.

43
00:02:03,435 --> 00:02:03,636
Scott: Fuck.

44
00:02:03,676 --> 00:02:08,739
Scott: Yeah, so I'm like fuck Yeah, and I buy that shit right and I keep going along and I'm keep.

45
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:16,068
Scott: you know I'm starting to run out of drone parts Even though I tried to get as many as I could and anytime I had an option to like trade missiles for drone parts I did so.

46
00:02:16,472 --> 00:02:17,160
Scott: such like that, right?

47
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,679
Scott: Yeah, and I'm going along with my drone parts and I you know I got a weapon to accompany my own cannon and things are going.

48
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:37,992
Scott: nice I'm I just I can blow through the regular game up until the boss a hundred percent easily every time on easy no matter what right but Throughout this game for I was like, I really need that thing that you know The drone the drone part collector.

49
00:02:38,073 --> 00:02:41,972
Scott: so I have to so I can stop buying Every time I get that I.

50
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:46,559
Rym: Somehow that means I'll have like 80 drone parts by the end.

51
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:50,726
Scott: Yeah But it's better than having to spend Scrap on drone part.

52
00:02:50,746 --> 00:02:55,160
Rym: you only need that if you're doing what I'm doing where you're busting out like three drones every fight.

53
00:02:55,261 --> 00:02:56,046
Scott: Yeah, I was dry.

54
00:02:56,066 --> 00:02:58,080
Scott: I was busting out like two three drones every fight.

55
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,074
Scott: I actually found another anti-ship drone, but I never found the drone collect II thing.

56
00:03:02,114 --> 00:03:13,967
Scott: and then of course You know by the end of the game I had my shields all the way up But I didn't have my engines up as much as I wanted because I had to spend so much scrap on freaking drone parts Right.

57
00:03:14,188 --> 00:03:18,732
Scott: Well, don't use the drones as much But I had to to kill the bad guys.

58
00:03:18,773 --> 00:03:20,140
Rym: No, you gotta have some regular weapons.

59
00:03:20,361 --> 00:03:27,539
Scott: I did have regular weapons, but the other problem was is I had to to power all three drones simultaneously Which I knew I was gonna need to beat the boss.

60
00:03:29,022 --> 00:03:33,180
Scott: I needed to upgrade the drone section to hold six energy random aside.

61
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,560
Scott: We gotta add six energy to the thing.

62
00:03:36,682 --> 00:03:39,225
Rym: I gotta isolate that simultaneously grab and make a.

63
00:03:39,325 --> 00:03:45,183
Scott: so because I had to put so much of my scrap into upgrading the drone section and buying drones I Wasn't able.

64
00:03:45,203 --> 00:03:49,240
Scott: I actually picked up like a crazy awesome weapon, but it required for energy.

65
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:51,749
Scott: I got the weapon for free and I could did.

66
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:53,816
Scott: there was impossible to power that weapon.

67
00:03:53,896 --> 00:03:54,860
Rym: What do you saw that screenshot?

68
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,928
Rym: I had like four fucking giant weapons.

69
00:03:57,048 --> 00:03:59,820
Scott: It was not possible to power all that stuff.

70
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:04,680
Scott: No The way you didn't get it up straight is I lost all that scrap to buying.

71
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,934
Rym: You're like power down those engines and oxygen and then power up the weapons.

72
00:04:08,974 --> 00:04:12,332
Scott: do a big burst if that You know and then of course I can.

73
00:04:12,413 --> 00:04:13,180
Scott: I get to the end of the game.

74
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,434
Scott: I fight the boss, but I can't beat him because they can't power all the things.

75
00:04:16,454 --> 00:04:19,926
Scott: and then right I died the boss.

76
00:04:19,946 --> 00:04:22,540
Rym: Yeah, I've never used crew teleporter against the boss.

77
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,205
Rym: I want to try that.

78
00:04:23,225 --> 00:04:25,120
Scott: cuz I think I did and you know what happened.

79
00:04:25,604 --> 00:04:27,420
Scott: It was actually working really awesome.

80
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,163
Rym: You know what I do.

81
00:04:28,224 --> 00:04:31,780
Rym: what I want to do is send got like a rock man into like the weapon pod.

82
00:04:32,202 --> 00:04:34,613
Scott: Yeah, it was working really awesomely.

83
00:04:34,633 --> 00:04:41,180
Scott: right in the first go I just shredded him up right and in the second go I sent him over there and I was also shredding him up.

84
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,931
Rym: I want like but then boarding drone.

85
00:04:43,072 --> 00:04:44,059
Scott: it only took.

86
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,452
Scott: Drones would be a lot better for boarding drone.

87
00:04:46,472 --> 00:04:46,794
Scott: No, ain't.

88
00:04:48,642 --> 00:04:56,123
Scott: But then I just fucked up a little bit right like one slip up and suddenly your teleporter is broken and you're trying to Repair it.

89
00:04:56,424 --> 00:04:59,500
Scott: but then you got to repair your oxygen because your ship is gonna die.

90
00:05:00,544 --> 00:05:02,591
Scott: So then suddenly you're scrambling to fix your ship.

91
00:05:02,751 --> 00:05:05,320
Scott: Meanwhile, your two guys are suffocating over in the boss.

92
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,711
Rym: She's got you know what and then it's all right now.

93
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:09,500
Rym: I know how all those other ships felt.

94
00:05:10,461 --> 00:05:13,529
Scott: I basically I can get to the boss almost 100% of the time on easy 99% of the time.

95
00:05:13,549 --> 00:05:18,864
Scott: I Had it all set up.

96
00:05:18,904 --> 00:05:20,409
Scott: I had the drone collecti bit.

97
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:22,858
Scott: I had three anti-ship drones.

98
00:05:22,898 --> 00:05:23,380
Scott: I had plenty of.

99
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:27,531
Rym: Get rid of the drone collecti bullshit and put something else there.

100
00:05:27,571 --> 00:05:29,556
Scott: There was nothing for sale there.

101
00:05:30,058 --> 00:05:30,860
Scott: There's no shop.

102
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,691
Rym: There's multiple shops before the fat last zone.

103
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:39,997
Scott: There was not a shop that was selling a Augmentation of any kind in the last two lines.

104
00:05:40,017 --> 00:05:44,740
Scott: now I was looking for one in the final sector cuz I knew that I didn't need this thing anymore.

105
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:46,648
Scott: There was not one available.

106
00:05:46,668 --> 00:05:48,374
Scott: All right, and then it was fine.

107
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,780
Scott: I beat the first section of the boss.

108
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:53,625
Scott: I'd be the second section of the boss easily but then the third section.

109
00:05:53,645 --> 00:06:06,251
Scott: I had so little small amount of hull and no way to repair it because the randomness of the map drawing in the final sector Right put all three repairs next to the base.

110
00:06:06,452 --> 00:06:08,638
Rym: I've never bothered with repairs.

111
00:06:08,738 --> 00:06:19,035
Scott: and then No, but not only that in order to fly to the boss I had to fly through two of the repairs wasting them when I was already fully healed.

112
00:06:19,477 --> 00:06:21,104
Rym: and then after this I just wait.

113
00:06:21,145 --> 00:06:24,604
Rym: there's an option to not jump just wait Hold on.

114
00:06:25,226 --> 00:06:26,050
Scott: I can't just wait.

115
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,677
Scott: you have to go out to fight the boss.

116
00:06:27,717 --> 00:06:28,299
Rym: He'll come to you.

117
00:06:28,683 --> 00:06:30,240
Scott: No, you can't just wait at the base.

118
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,000
Scott: You have to go out at least a little bit go out a little bit and then wait a little bit.

119
00:06:34,141 --> 00:06:35,386
Scott: I had to immediately.

120
00:06:35,426 --> 00:06:41,039
Scott: the only physical star I could go to was the repair star And was because of the random generation.

121
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,488
Scott: I'm telling you this there was no way to go.

122
00:06:44,588 --> 00:06:49,731
Scott: I in or the only way out of the base was through a minimum of Two repair stars got it.

123
00:06:49,751 --> 00:06:50,859
Scott: You know other way to go.

124
00:06:51,121 --> 00:06:54,660
Rym: You're not being trolled if someone flipped like the bullshit bit on your computer.

125
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,832
Scott: I'm telling you because I have not it.

126
00:06:57,073 --> 00:06:58,260
Rym: we need to play this together.

127
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:07,000
Rym: We need to do a Dave and Joel style stream of like this have Every time there is some like one random bullshit that prevents me from beating the boss.

128
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:10,533
Rym: Meanwhile I play every time and it's like hey, I'm a rock man.

129
00:07:10,573 --> 00:07:11,437
Rym: I'd like to join your crew.

130
00:07:11,517 --> 00:07:11,658
Rym: Hey.

131
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:12,300
Scott: I'm a rock man.

132
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,689
Scott: I like yeah, you know what happens to me.

133
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:13,870
Scott: Hey.

134
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,400
Scott: I'm a rock man like to join your crew awesome.

135
00:07:15,481 --> 00:07:17,234
Scott: Hey, I'm a mantis like to join your crew awesome.

136
00:07:17,617 --> 00:07:19,624
Scott: Hey There's an old man.

137
00:07:19,645 --> 00:07:22,357
Scott: Would you like to try to bring him up to join your crew?

138
00:07:22,457 --> 00:07:23,120
Scott: and I'm like hell.

139
00:07:23,341 --> 00:07:23,562
Scott: You know.

140
00:07:23,582 --> 00:07:28,140
Scott: I know this doesn't work sometimes, but how can I pass up a possibly free crew member yes?

141
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:32,100
Scott: Yeah, not only does he die he kills one of your crew members who went to get him restart.

142
00:07:32,603 --> 00:07:34,335
Rym: So the saddest thing that ever happened.

143
00:07:34,355 --> 00:07:35,120
Rym: it happened recently.

144
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:37,780
Rym: I was trying the whole like teleporting crew thing in this game.

145
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,443
Rym: I didn't finish.

146
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:44,452
Rym: so I teleport most of my crew over to the enemy ship and they're fucking it up And everything's going great, and then out of nowhere.

147
00:07:44,492 --> 00:07:45,839
Rym: It's like they're charging up their FTL.

148
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,390
Scott: So you gotta shoot you gotta shoot the pilot so they can't go.

149
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,173
Rym: so I pause.

150
00:07:49,233 --> 00:07:50,157
Rym: I'm like no biggie.

151
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:53,420
Rym: No biggie No, I couldn't teleport him back because I'd been ion hit.

152
00:07:53,822 --> 00:07:58,725
Rym: But I put two ion cannons at the pilot And I targeted the engine.

153
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:00,851
Rym: and just it happened to be chance.

154
00:08:01,433 --> 00:08:08,095
Rym: three full sets of volleys all Missed and then the ship disappeared with my entire crew.

155
00:08:08,336 --> 00:08:12,476
Scott: yeah, there's a video I watched showing final boss strategy and this guy.

156
00:08:12,536 --> 00:08:23,600
Scott: he had stealth He had full shield he had crazy awesome burst lasers right and he had the the hull beam right and his strategy Was this seems pretty good genius strategy?

157
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,307
Scott: He had right he was operating.

158
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,760
Scott: he was using the real-time nature of the game right to his advantage.

159
00:08:29,103 --> 00:08:30,617
Scott: What he would do is he would go up against the boss.

160
00:08:31,563 --> 00:08:33,933
Scott: When the boss is that he would pause all the time like crazy.

161
00:08:34,294 --> 00:08:37,827
Scott: if the boss was about to fire That's when he'd activate the stuff right.

162
00:08:38,048 --> 00:08:43,188
Scott: so all the missiles passed over him when he had all of his way Wasn't auto firing either.

163
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:51,569
Scott: when all his weapons were charged He would fire all the beams all at once like doo doo doo doo doom And if they all hit the shield would be down to nothing.

164
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:55,528
Scott: and then you would you have it paused already because he basically be Like fire.

165
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,082
Scott: pause Right.

166
00:08:57,363 --> 00:09:06,362
Scott: if the shields were 100% down you immediately fire the hull beam in this really precise way that did as much damage as humanly possible across like Multiple.

167
00:09:06,402 --> 00:09:10,374
Rym: that's the only reason I use beam weapons because I really like drawing that line right.

168
00:09:10,394 --> 00:09:12,220
Scott: so he draws that line perfectly every time.

169
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,866
Scott: So he does for the maximum effect.

170
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:14,889
Rym: You know it's weird.

171
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:24,360
Rym: There's a few things that really get me going in games, and it's basically Maximizing damage with the mechanic literally like one pixel of the line is in one section of the other guy.

172
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,915
Scott: So that an inventory Tetris, so then you know it worked most of the time right.

173
00:09:29,955 --> 00:09:35,758
Scott: and if the if the if the burst weapons Didn't break through the shield he would just sort of keep defending until the next.

174
00:09:35,818 --> 00:09:40,331
Scott: you know Chant when I can tell the weapons were charged again And he just kept doing this and it totally worked.

175
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,380
Scott: and it totally worked, and I was like this is genius.

176
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:43,366
Scott: How could he lose with this?

177
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:45,359
Scott: and then of course random bullshit up?

178
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:51,580
Scott: And all the drones come out of the boss and his stealth wasn't charged yet, and that's the problem.

179
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,051
Scott: Don't use fucking stealth, but he also had max shields.

180
00:09:54,493 --> 00:10:01,540
Rym: It wasn't like fuck stealth Stealth or four crazy weapons and three drones all the same.

181
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,945
Scott: He had all that he had.

182
00:10:03,026 --> 00:10:05,334
Scott: you should see he had everything you need to have.

183
00:10:05,394 --> 00:10:07,442
Scott: it's just random bullshit I don't know.

184
00:10:07,602 --> 00:10:13,056
Rym: I win the majority of the times that play on easy and normal is not that hard either.

185
00:10:13,076 --> 00:10:15,928
Rym: It's bullshit anyway.

186
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:19,306
Scott: He's already did a show on this.

187
00:10:19,688 --> 00:10:21,296
Scott: so here's that ism gaming news.

Rym: What's it?

199
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,849
Rym: It's not interesting, but I've realized I don't use my fucking Xbox for anything except Netflix anymore.

200
00:11:04,869 --> 00:11:19,878
Rym: I Don't use the Xbox for anything else, and I'm not gonna renew my xbox gold.

201
00:11:19,898 --> 00:11:26,644
Rym: no I don't even know when it expires, but I see no Conceivable reason to buy this.

202
00:11:26,684 --> 00:11:29,352
Rym: an Xbox over PC no Xbox.

203
00:11:29,412 --> 00:11:35,140
Scott: if you're one of those dumb people who doesn't have a computer attached to your television Yeah, but then I can't play it on my laptop.

204
00:11:35,941 --> 00:11:37,105
Scott: It's like people don't have this.

205
00:11:37,326 --> 00:11:37,627
Scott: you know.

206
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:42,247
Scott: realization that like it's like oh, I want to play it on my TV So I'm gonna get an Xbox.

207
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:45,606
Scott: even the angry video game nerd was like yeah I don't like emulators cuz they can't blame.

208
00:11:45,626 --> 00:11:48,198
Scott: my team will plug a fucking computer in your TV like a normal person.

209
00:11:48,218 --> 00:11:56,400
Rym: how many times You have to say this In my entire life, and I'll be perfectly honest as a hardcore gamer as all these things in my entire life.

210
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,770
Rym: I have maybe two or three regrets in Everything I've ever done in the last 30 years.

211
00:12:01,493 --> 00:12:03,360
Rym: one of them is buying an Xbox 360.

212
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,072
Scott: I don't necessarily regret it, but it's like I regret it.

213
00:12:06,132 --> 00:12:08,040
Scott: I would have been fine not doing so.

214
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,212
Rym: I would rather have owned Super Street Fighter 4 on the computer.

215
00:12:11,392 --> 00:12:11,874
Scott: Yeah, well.

216
00:12:11,894 --> 00:12:13,360
Scott: I don't think it's super on the computer.

217
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,780
Scott: I don't know regular is on the computer.

218
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,320
Rym: I would have been okay with not owning the game as much as I'm really pac-man.

219
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:18,884
Scott: I just like.

220
00:12:18,925 --> 00:12:23,067
Scott: I wouldn't want to live without that pac-man But I haven't played that pac-man in months.

221
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:28,714
Scott: that pac-man is not worth the amount of money in Xbox costs even though That pac-man.

222
00:12:28,755 --> 00:12:29,139
Scott: oh my god.

223
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:42,899
Rym: Seriously though I'm way excited about Monaco because the version of this game that we played at Pax - over two years ago was already enough for me to throw like 40 bucks at him.

224
00:12:44,421 --> 00:12:56,360
Rym: So I can't imagine what it's like now, but I can because at the last packs where I saw it I didn't play it, but every time I walked by that booth the people standing at the booth were screaming while they were playing.

225
00:12:57,201 --> 00:12:59,410
Scott: I've only ever seen that booth crowded and screaming.

226
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:01,680
Rym: Yeah, it's just people yelling and screaming and curse.

227
00:13:01,862 --> 00:13:03,780
Rym: Oh my god the game looks so good.

228
00:13:04,394 --> 00:13:05,843
Rym: so Xcom.

229
00:13:06,063 --> 00:13:08,715
Rym: as you all know the new xcom is out, but it's 50 bucks.

230
00:13:08,756 --> 00:13:09,278
Scott: fuck that.

231
00:13:09,619 --> 00:13:13,112
Rym: now The thing is the game is probably worth 50 bucks.

232
00:13:13,212 --> 00:13:23,859
Scott: play the demo not worth 50 bucks But it is xcom now a lot easier to play too because the interface is modern It's interesting and it says a lot about the game industry.

233
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:29,665
Rym: now It's funny because I what I'm about to say is basically the same thing I was saying about anime.

234
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:33,236
Scott: in the same thing you say about everything not everything, but anime.

235
00:13:33,256 --> 00:13:33,757
Rym: in 2005 you're consistent.

236
00:13:35,062 --> 00:13:39,842
Rym: When in 2005 I was like yeah, X is a really good show X being pot You know.

237
00:13:40,184 --> 00:13:46,427
Rym: and I guess I should say I don't want to talk about X the anime But you know why.

238
00:13:46,447 --> 00:13:47,571
Rym: I guess that's also an anime.

239
00:13:47,772 --> 00:13:48,996
Scott: no East is the east.

240
00:13:49,076 --> 00:13:49,899
Scott: wow is pronounced.

241
00:13:50,241 --> 00:13:54,763
Rym: I see wanderers for me anyway, so I Like a show a lot.

242
00:13:55,145 --> 00:13:56,851
Rym: I would consider a show like the count of money.

243
00:13:56,871 --> 00:13:58,155
Rym: crystal was an excellent example.

244
00:13:58,195 --> 00:13:59,580
Rym: that show was great.

245
00:13:59,721 --> 00:14:01,932
Rym: It was like a b-plus a-minus anime.

246
00:14:01,992 --> 00:14:09,771
Rym: I love the shit out of it and the DVD box that came out and Later, I saw it on sale on Amazon for like six bucks.

247
00:14:10,032 --> 00:14:18,638
Rym: Yeah, and I looked at I'm like holy shit six bucks Didn't even fucking buy it.

248
00:14:20,002 --> 00:14:38,720
Rym: so as xcom is like one of the poster childs of a game made in 1994 that somehow in all these years no one was able to remake correctly until Xcom is one of the formative games of my life.

249
00:14:38,981 --> 00:14:43,456
Scott: It's your jam one of my favorite common bands who ever buy on a commando.

250
00:14:43,476 --> 00:14:44,500
Scott: Those are rims three jams.

251
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,953
Rym: So let's name all the xcom games 1994 xcom enemy unknown.

252
00:14:47,993 --> 00:14:49,659
Rym: the real one one of the best games ever.

253
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:52,693
Rym: 1995 xcom terror from the deep shit.

254
00:14:53,276 --> 00:14:54,120
Rym: xcom apocalypse.

255
00:14:55,101 --> 00:14:57,949
Rym: Xcom interceptor not even an xcom game.

256
00:14:58,451 --> 00:15:00,056
Rym: xcom first alien in big.

257
00:15:00,276 --> 00:15:01,360
Rym: seriously has bro.

258
00:15:02,022 --> 00:15:04,047
Rym: Xcom enforcer I've never even heard of.

259
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:05,712
Scott: that's a third-person shooter.

260
00:15:05,752 --> 00:15:07,176
Scott: That's the worst xcom.

261
00:15:07,216 --> 00:15:14,197
Rym: Genesis was cancelled As was xcom Alliance and then xcom enemy unknown.

262
00:15:14,237 --> 00:15:19,237
Scott: in 2012 I think there was actually one that was I think was excellent.

263
00:15:19,257 --> 00:15:19,840
Scott: apocalypse.

264
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,711
Scott: Maybe was the one that was closest the closest.

265
00:15:22,751 --> 00:15:27,011
Scott: it actually played like the original xcom But it was some more modern.

266
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:27,594
Scott: It just didn't.

267
00:15:27,715 --> 00:15:28,560
Rym: it was not a good.

268
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,931
Scott: It was not as good as it did any.

269
00:15:29,992 --> 00:15:31,020
Scott: it didn't have the base part.

270
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:45,780
Rym: It was just the base parts the only part I care about right, but anyway, so despite even not you know That's not even counting the like dozen open source like attempts by game people to make the unreal tournament mod laser.

271
00:15:46,902 --> 00:15:49,631
Scott: They were all awful and no one finished working on any of them.

272
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:52,280
Rym: so thus the conundrum of the gaming industry.

273
00:15:52,665 --> 00:15:53,699
Rym: We gave a lecture at PAX.

274
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:59,179
Rym: We don't have a video of a long time ago called egregiously unrealized potential where we talked about like how?

275
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,769
Rym: Games like xcom or chrono trigger.

276
00:16:01,789 --> 00:16:04,179
Rym: just nobody fucking remakes and nobody just does it right.

277
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:04,862
Scott: well They did.

278
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:08,257
Rym: it's like people don't understand the essence of what made these games good.

279
00:16:08,277 --> 00:16:20,795
Rym: and here It is a perfect example of just doing exactly what I've been saying people should do for a decade And I can't be asked to pay 50 bucks for it's a lot of fucking money.

280
00:16:20,835 --> 00:16:22,020
Scott: buying a commando rearm.

281
00:16:22,341 --> 00:16:24,729
Scott: It was 20 I 50 bucks.

282
00:16:24,849 --> 00:16:27,940
Rym: I'll blow that on dinner and not even think but that's dinner.

283
00:16:29,581 --> 00:16:30,806
Rym: Also, this is my jam.

284
00:16:30,826 --> 00:16:32,272
Rym: I don't know.

285
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:34,300
Scott: a lot of money for xcom.

286
00:16:34,881 --> 00:16:36,386
Scott: I don't think it is what I mean.

287
00:16:36,426 --> 00:16:37,048
Scott: what video game?

288
00:16:37,068 --> 00:16:43,666
Rym: when I got I paid $70 for Zelda 2 $65 for Mario 3.

289
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,152
Scott: xcom is a single-player game.

290
00:16:45,433 --> 00:16:48,940
Scott: if I bought it or someone gave it to me for free I'd play it through and probably stop playing.

291
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:54,732
Scott: It's a multiplayer component, but it doesn't seem like a good multi-player component one.

292
00:16:54,752 --> 00:16:55,835
Scott: That's worth playing a lot.

293
00:16:56,136 --> 00:16:57,679
Rym: xcom UFO defense.

294
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,502
Rym: I Pirated.

295
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:01,116
Rym: I didn't pay anything for it.

296
00:17:01,378 --> 00:17:10,777
Rym: in fact It was the first game I ever pirated on purpose, and I played it without an instruction book which was extra awesome, but Like one day I figured out I could duck and I was like oh

297
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,009
Scott: Yeah, but the point is

298
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:20,068
Rym: but I got maybe I don't know 4,000 hours of entertainment out of that game.

299
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:21,593
Rym: I played it as much as I played.

300
00:17:21,653 --> 00:17:24,564
Scott: sieve fucking - I'm telling you is a Counter-strike.

301
00:17:24,584 --> 00:17:26,494
Scott: global offensive was 14 and change.

302
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,439
Scott: So xcom does not hold a candle to that shit, so he can't charge me Multiple times the car.

303
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:37,753
Rym: But you're saying that not worth 50 bucks.

304
00:17:38,095 --> 00:17:41,085
Rym: Here's my problem 50 bucks the price.

305
00:17:41,165 --> 00:17:43,574
Rym: it could be a thousand dollars and have the same discussion.

306
00:17:43,995 --> 00:17:48,167
Rym: the problem is simply Once again, I look at my steam profiler.

307
00:17:48,187 --> 00:17:49,671
Rym: I mean I got steam open right now.

308
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:52,518
Rym: What games have I never even installed?

309
00:17:52,598 --> 00:17:55,308
Rym: most area Battlefield 2 bad company.

310
00:17:55,649 --> 00:17:57,014
Scott: Why do you even buy battlefield?

311
00:17:57,075 --> 00:17:58,360
Rym: I think I got it like a dollar.

312
00:17:58,681 --> 00:18:00,807
Rym: I uninstalled Bioshock and Borderlands.

313
00:18:00,868 --> 00:18:03,576
Rym: I've never actually played braid on this computer.

314
00:18:03,596 --> 00:18:10,116
Rym: Dave defeat I don't know how I got that all our three ideas is a half-life 1 mod your grandfathered in.

315
00:18:10,397 --> 00:18:15,571
Rym: I have played Europa Universalis 3 a couple of times couple times Let's see Magica.

316
00:18:15,611 --> 00:18:19,912
Rym: I haven't even installed Machinarium Lugaru loom.

317
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:24,791
Rym: I. I've got enough games to last me a decade right unplayed.

318
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:25,233
Rym: Yep.

319
00:18:26,055 --> 00:18:31,592
Scott: It's a supply and demand of all Games regardless of what the game is, but this is the problem.

320
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:41,600
Rym: a game that is both rims Personal direct jam done correctly and done the way he specified well close enough at least won't play it.

321
00:18:42,044 --> 00:18:43,378
Rym: What do we do about this?

322
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,146
Scott: Don't charge 50 fucking dollars.

323
00:18:46,286 --> 00:18:47,390
Rym: if it was free.

324
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:50,699
Scott: I still wouldn't be playing it right now, but you would have downloaded it.

325
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,925
Scott: Yeah, I wouldn't be playing it If it was a dollar.

326
00:18:53,985 --> 00:18:55,230
Scott: you would have paid the dollar.

327
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,595
Rym: even I wouldn't be playing.

328
00:18:56,615 --> 00:19:00,146
Scott: you still would have paid the dollar And you'd play it eventually.

329
00:19:00,387 --> 00:19:04,219
Rym: what does it take for me to play a game that isn't Counter-Strike?

330
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:10,971
Rym: I mean it might take a New advanced wars on a computer.

331
00:19:10,991 --> 00:19:12,979
Rym: Oh, yeah, I might do it.

332
00:19:15,805 --> 00:19:16,208
Rym: Anyway, you know.

333
00:19:16,228 --> 00:19:18,000
Rym: sort of brief news that we can go on.

334
00:19:19,581 --> 00:19:21,269
Scott: So another thing it takes to get someone.

335
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:23,580
Scott: I mean you're gonna you would play it eventually, right?

336
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,996
Scott: The question really is what would it take to get you to play the game now, right?

337
00:19:27,924 --> 00:19:28,920
Scott: To get to play the game now.

338
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,759
Scott: There has to be a reason to play it now as opposed to at some point later in my life Which means there needs to be some sort of?

339
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:43,316
Scott: multiplayer Community some some component where playing it this instant is actually different like tribes do.

340
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:45,639
Scott: if you didn't play it when it came out Well, you didn't play now.

341
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:53,040
Rym: It's interesting is that there was a time Like when Dave's X came out human revolution a lot of the people I talked to and hang out with on the internet.

342
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,139
Rym: We're all playing it right away.

343
00:19:54,623 --> 00:19:56,980
Rym: So I was missing out on that and when I finally played it.

344
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,713
Scott: I don't know why people are so concerned missing out on no.

345
00:19:59,753 --> 00:20:06,670
Scott: No, I'm missing out on the talking The shared Experience and dialogue of like.

346
00:20:07,011 --> 00:20:09,180
Rym: like like the Dave and Joel it hasn't gone anywhere.

347
00:20:09,361 --> 00:20:13,680
Scott: Those people still had that experience and still remember it and you can talk about it with them later when you have it.

348
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,499
Rym: Also, yeah, and then it becomes like our crew where we want it.

349
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:21,760
Rym: You know someone else starts reading The Prince of Nothing and wants to talk about and everyone else is like fuck.

350
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,526
Scott: Talk about that anytime.

351
00:20:25,064 --> 00:20:37,049
Rym: But anyway, let's talk about it right now, but now Most of the people I talked to online except for the people who don't have jobs or are still in college or Don't have anything else going on.

352
00:20:37,672 --> 00:20:41,905
Rym: They're the only ones who play single-player games Except Dave and Joel, I guess.

353
00:20:42,587 --> 00:20:45,596
Scott: well, you know game reviewer type people and stuff like that.

354
00:20:45,616 --> 00:20:46,700
Rym: We're game reviewer type people.

355
00:20:47,822 --> 00:20:48,951
Scott: We're not paid to do it.

356
00:20:49,031 --> 00:20:53,080
Rym: nor is it our primary Argue that most people are not effectively paid to do it.

357
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,665
Scott: Well, imagine this right Rym.

358
00:20:54,705 --> 00:20:59,240
Scott: if we didn't if we didn't care about anime manga comics technology or anything.

359
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,175
Scott: But video games now board games no role-playing games.

360
00:21:02,195 --> 00:21:05,740
Scott: I Imagine we would be paying 50 bucks for xcom and doing alright.

361
00:21:06,103 --> 00:21:09,344
Scott: And I think there's just a lot of people out there that you know We interact with.

362
00:21:09,404 --> 00:21:15,973
Scott: and you sort of forget that these people, you know They might dabble in some comics and read some webcomics.

363
00:21:15,993 --> 00:21:20,460
Scott: so they might you know, but it's like they're Mostly in video games, right?

364
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:26,400
Scott: It's like that is you know, if you if you divide made a little percentage chart of like how much of them is each geekery?

365
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:29,576
Scott: It's like, you know video games would be over 50 60 percent.

366
00:21:29,636 --> 00:21:29,958
Scott: Well, it is.

367
00:21:31,801 --> 00:21:33,105
Scott: It's more even ways.

368
00:21:33,165 --> 00:21:34,609
Scott: it's like 25 25 15 10, right?

369
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,375
Scott: There's nothing.

370
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:40,208
Scott: there's no hot geekery that I have That's even over 25%.

371
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:44,163
Rym: so yeah, but I guess case in point look at Otakon the.

372
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:49,854
Rym: you know, we were guests of Otakon doing lectures for almost a decade and We did a lot of them.

373
00:21:49,874 --> 00:21:51,262
Rym: one year We did like five.

374
00:21:51,804 --> 00:21:59,359
Rym: the biggest and most popular thing we ever did at an Otakon was beyond Dungeons and Dragons.

375
00:22:00,281 --> 00:22:04,719
Rym: Gaming is the most popular thing at the biggest anime convention in America.

376
00:22:05,421 --> 00:22:06,745
Rym: Mmm, it says a lot.

377
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:08,790
Rym: I think that says more about anime than about gaming now.

378
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:17,610
Rym: So anyway very briefly, you know, the New York Comic Con happened and as you know, we didn't go for the first time For the second time.

379
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,640
Scott: we didn't go to the very first one.

380
00:22:18,748 --> 00:22:22,552
Rym: Yeah We couldn't though that the guests could go to the first one to go to the first.

381
00:22:22,572 --> 00:22:26,239
Rym: the guests of the convention could not get Into the first New York Comic Con.

382
00:22:26,923 --> 00:22:31,080
Rym: But no I went to everyone after that and I did not go to this one despite having a free badge.

383
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:37,936
Rym: And it's interesting that when I looked over You know the comic part of it had some interesting stuff going on, but anime is gone.

384
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:42,314
Rym: There's no anime there and Gaming is also gone.

385
00:22:43,642 --> 00:22:49,178
Rym: Yeah, based on the online coverage right a lot of the kind of show has been replaced by TV.

386
00:22:51,964 --> 00:22:53,079
Rym: It's SDCC light.

387
00:22:53,381 --> 00:22:55,890
Scott: Yeah, so but looking at the online coverage it's.

388
00:22:55,930 --> 00:23:00,713
Scott: they showed a clip of the first episode of ponies Which I got to see on the internet.

389
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:04,859
Scott: Yep, and to There was.

390
00:23:05,722 --> 00:23:06,185
Scott: There was this.

391
00:23:06,366 --> 00:23:07,251
Scott: I think there's the usual.

392
00:23:07,292 --> 00:23:10,399
Scott: the Gundam booth is always awesome But someone took pictures of every Gundam in it.

393
00:23:10,501 --> 00:23:16,257
Rym: So there was like this e-level mezzanine where all the anime kids and all the people who sit on the floor at cons sat on the floor right.

394
00:23:16,678 --> 00:23:20,535
Scott: and then the only thing that I could tell from the internet that I missed at this

395
00:23:20,595 --> 00:23:20,977
Rym: con

396
00:23:21,218 --> 00:23:21,539
Scott: right is

397
00:23:22,681 --> 00:23:26,339
Rym: the security line because now they were searching bags to let people in that

398
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:45,700
Scott: and Be if you read bakuman There is a manga within the manga of bakuman no dog called ocelot number an otter number 11 and they had there they were giving away Otter number 11 like the spin-off which is sort of the same.

399
00:23:45,881 --> 00:23:48,100
Scott: It's sort of the same ideas like kuji biki unbalanced.

400
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:48,441
Rym: You know.

401
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:54,160
Rym: you could do Scott if you really wanted it because way back when I I could easily get it if I wanted to.

402
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,120
Rym: Yes, yeah, cuz when I really wanted that that pit boy.

403
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:05,280
Scott: Multiple listeners send me their pit boys if anyone's gonna copy about her number 11 It makes Scott really don't even need to send it to me.

404
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,980
Scott: Just scan it in and send me some JPEGs or send me a link to the JPEGs or whatever.

405
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:09,723
Scott: I just want to read it.

406
00:24:09,743 --> 00:24:10,686
Scott: I don't need to have it.

407
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,022
Scott: I don't need more shit my house, but I don't know It's just.

408
00:24:15,243 --> 00:24:26,143
Rym: it's interesting because I had some conversations with a lot of different people related to the or comic-con a couple years ago And the sentiment then was very directly Increased.

409
00:24:26,184 --> 00:24:29,280
Rym: the gaming industry and gaming content at the New York comic-con.

410
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:41,500
Rym: There was a big internal push for that and then all those people one by one Stop talking about it with me and then stop talking to me and then all the gaming content of the New York comic-con disappeared.

411
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:49,920
Scott: Yeah, and I know those Watson is still there though And I'm pretty sure there's still a few booths that belong to various games like a crane was there.

412
00:24:50,000 --> 00:25:00,778
Rym: but the gaming content at the New York comic-con has diminished substantially and As opposed to increase dramatically, which was what people specifically said they were going to do.

413
00:25:00,818 --> 00:25:04,992
Rym: So I'm curious Who at read pop made the call of you know what?

414
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:06,960
Rym: Let's just try to be a shit here.

415
00:25:07,502 --> 00:25:11,036
Scott: I guess they don't want to overlap with packs and they want to make money.

416
00:25:11,116 --> 00:25:11,980
Scott: right and you think about it.

417
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:17,064
Scott: Well, if we have a booth, yeah a booth selling comics makes more dollars Oh foot.

418
00:25:17,284 --> 00:25:21,500
Scott: then a table for tabletop replay does yeah, which makes zero dollars per square foot.

419
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:27,080
Rym: But then you have the you know, the interesting incentive of you don't want people to stay in the convention for three days.

420
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:31,380
Rym: You'd rather have three different people come for a few hours on three different day, right?

421
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:37,220
Scott: Because if three different people come then it's you know, that's that's more customers per booth.

422
00:25:37,321 --> 00:25:39,512
Scott: So all the exhibitors will make more money.

423
00:25:39,532 --> 00:25:43,267
Scott: and if the exhibitors make more money You can charge more money for the tables.

424
00:25:43,548 --> 00:25:52,088
Scott: and you know, so it's like oh that comment that guy just selling his comics You know from kind of came in from New Jersey Makes five hundred dollars.

425
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:54,240
Scott: You can't sell him a table over five hundred dollars.

426
00:25:54,441 --> 00:25:57,636
Scott: Anyway, that if he makes five thousand you can sell him a table over one thousand.

427
00:25:57,656 --> 00:25:58,480
Rym: We'll talk about that later.

428
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:08,293
Rym: That's kind of a separate show because it's basically look at packs and Otakon and the New York Comic Con like those three between all three of them show like the three possible directions the convention.

429
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:13,801
Scott: the one thing about the con is like It's if you want to buy some stuff they have stuff that you know It's.

430
00:26:14,183 --> 00:26:16,133
Scott: I guess it'd be convenient especially because I live here.

431
00:26:16,595 --> 00:26:24,200
Scott: but the cost Getting in Outways the cost of you know, makes it not economical to buy anything.

432
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,310
Scott: It's like yeah, I'm gonna buy a badge just to buy stuff.

433
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:28,280
Scott: Oh, maybe they just buy this stuff online.

434
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:35,560
Rym: Maybe this is something really snarky and self-centered to say I kind of forget unless I think about it that conventions cost money.

435
00:26:36,521 --> 00:26:41,200
Scott: It's also think about all these people a lot of people I talked to go to the con.

436
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:52,620
Scott: I even talked to someone who was thinking about just standing outside the con because it's like all they just wanted to do was sort of like, you know Goggle and gaggle at people in costumes at the you know, and it's like we're just so jaded.

437
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:54,380
Scott: It's not worth anything to us anymore.

438
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:58,377
Rym: But to a lot of if it's it's to a lot of years of Otakon that did that to us.

439
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:05,424
Scott: to a lot of people they just go to it and just being there and seeing all the nerdiness and costumes and craziness is like Whoa, it's that would.

440
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:06,849
Rym: it's so fun for them.

441
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:10,220
Scott: But for us that's like you'd have to pay me to do it.

442
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,530
Scott: It's like I've done that so many times.

443
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:15,551
Rym: that would you could not Know value for me whatsoever.

444
00:27:15,572 --> 00:27:20,569
Rym: the people I know who are the most excited about it Don't go to many cons or don't live in New York City.

445
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:24,141
Rym: Yeah, and I realized I mean think about it 2002.

446
00:27:24,141 --> 00:27:28,139
Rym: I went to my first anime convention and my mind was blown.

447
00:27:28,139 --> 00:27:29,545
Rym: 2003 jaded.

448
00:27:30,187 --> 00:27:31,191
Rym: Yeah, I'd seen it all.

449
00:27:31,211 --> 00:27:32,717
Scott: Yeah, it's like I walk in.

450

Scott: it's like people You know like you go in.

451
00:27:34,688 --> 00:27:36,480
Scott: and is that giant inflated Adventure Time?

452
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,595
Scott: Whatever a lot of Adventure Time fans are like, oh my god, so awesome.

453
00:27:40,635 --> 00:27:41,097
Scott: Holy shit.

454
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,386
Scott: Take my picture with it And I'm just like.

455
00:27:43,406 --> 00:27:46,779
Scott: no, I don't even notice that is there unless you point it out to me.

456
00:27:47,201 --> 00:27:48,647
Rym: It's like oh, hey, it's that inflated thing.

457
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,816
Rym: They had at the other the last 11 conventions.

458
00:27:50,856 --> 00:27:51,780
Rym: We attended exactly.

459
00:27:52,041 --> 00:27:57,055
Rym: Yeah, if I even notice it at all, I remember the last New York anime festival that happened.

460
00:27:57,095 --> 00:28:02,620
Rym: We literally showed up Did our lecture and walked out like immediately?

461
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:09,876
Scott: Someone told me the other I forget who it was maybe a week or two ago and they were like, yeah I was got on this train and these oh it was.

462
00:28:10,178 --> 00:28:18,190
Scott: uh my dad's friend from Connecticut and he talked about how he went to the city for Yankees game and he was on the subway and Some dudes came on the subway and started breakdancing.

463
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,119
Scott: and I'm like, why did you even look at them?

464
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,972
Scott: And he like he actually gave him money.

465
00:28:22,012 --> 00:28:22,558
Scott: and I'm like what?

466
00:28:23,721 --> 00:28:29,702
Scott: I'm like, dude If that he like people come on and they'll be like a mariachi band on the subway and I don't even know that they were There.

467
00:28:29,842 --> 00:28:32,191
Rym: no good thing for those of you don't live in New York.

468
00:28:32,231 --> 00:28:34,640
Rym: That is Scott is not in any way.

469
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,359
Rym: It's not like a I don't know an exaggeration or a silly.

470
00:28:37,741 --> 00:28:50,734
Rym: Literally, it'll be my morning commute and an entire mariachi band of like six people will come from another subway car into my subway car and play an entire song and No one even notices.

471
00:28:51,036 --> 00:28:55,799
Scott: Yep Like if I got my headphones in I might not even know that they I might.

472
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,479
Scott: you know It's like I won't react to it usually but I'll notice it.

473
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,540
Scott: I got mariachi band right and just go back to what I was doing and ignore them.

474
00:29:02,903 --> 00:29:10,256
Scott: But like if I got headphones in There's a good chance that they would come in and leave and I would and like I wouldn't even know that they were there in the first place.

475
00:29:19,292 --> 00:29:27,337
Rym: But anyway things of the day Try not to do like pony mashups because you know I've anyone who cares about.

476
00:29:27,377 --> 00:29:30,269
Rym: those have seen them all by this point and Gangnam style.

477
00:29:30,349 --> 00:29:43,630
Rym: I would Is also something that I would say I don't need to do anymore but This is just such an unexpected and unexpectedly delightful mashup.

478
00:29:45,071 --> 00:29:45,975
Rym: It's Ghostbusters.

479
00:29:46,036 --> 00:29:49,030
Scott: It's flawed slightly, but it's still good enough to be awesome.

480
00:29:49,472 --> 00:29:50,134
Rym: It's pretty great.

481
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:54,148
Rym: And the thing is you're gonna watch it and all you're gonna want to do is watch Ghostbusters again.

482
00:29:54,168 --> 00:30:01,186
Scott: Yeah So imagine if you know you were watching like a cartoon of like Superman, right and Superman went.

483
00:30:01,267 --> 00:30:04,297
Scott: he like flew away Right and he changed his clothes really fast.

484
00:30:04,699 --> 00:30:08,956
Scott: Imagine if you're walking down the street and you saw someone do that you would be like No, I wouldn't.

485
00:30:08,976 --> 00:30:09,561
Rym: it's New York.

486
00:30:09,621 --> 00:30:10,670
Rym: I see shit like that every day.

487
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:16,150
Scott: You don't see somebody change their clothes faster than someone could humanly possibly change their clothes and then fly.

488
00:30:16,391 --> 00:30:21,190
Scott: I saw a hobo stripping naked and changing clothes not as fast as Superman nor did he fly afterwards?

489
00:30:22,516 --> 00:30:24,008
Rym: He was lingering a little bit, right?

490
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:27,090
Scott: So imagine if you're walking on the street, you know.

491
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:38,410
Scott: And you saw a cartoon and it was Batman with his little grappling hook going whoosh and then jumping across Buildings that were way too far apart now Grappling hook right for any human being to possibly jump, but he did it anyway, right?

492
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:45,866
Scott: Well, if you saw that happen in real life You'd be and what they weren't using wires or like on a movie set you'd be like, whoa What the fuck even in New York, right?

493
00:30:45,946 --> 00:30:54,648
Scott: Yeah Here's a video of somebody doing something that you would normally consider to be almost superhuman But he actually just does it straight up.

494
00:30:55,412 --> 00:31:03,564
Scott: I'm not really a big fan of playing the game Metal Gear Solid but in Metal Gear Solid I know there was a character and his name is Revolver Ocelot.

495
00:31:03,584 --> 00:31:05,030
Rym: Do you know anything about Revolver Ocelot?

496
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:05,211
Rym: I

497
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:27,529
Scott: know that he is a dude who is really fucking good with revolvers and he's also a boss in the game and there are many cutscenes in which he spins his revolvers a great deal like whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh in a way that if you watch, you know in the video game where it's just a You know computer-generated graphics right would appear to be basically impossible for a real person to do.

498
00:31:28,651 --> 00:31:30,578
Scott: They are not impossible for real person to do.

499
00:31:30,618 --> 00:31:39,830
Scott: this guy made a YouTube video of him spinning his revolvers and doing the 100% exact same thing the Revolver Ocelot does in the cutscenes of the video game.

500
00:31:40,252 --> 00:31:42,202
Scott: He is a master of revolver spinning.

501
00:31:42,222 --> 00:31:43,710
Scott: He is so good at it.

502
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:48,429
Scott: He is as good as a fictionally super powered character at doing this.

503
00:31:48,711 --> 00:31:49,373
Rym: Good God.

504
00:31:49,433 --> 00:31:53,850
Rym: the article on Revolver Ocelot has 33 citations in Wikipedia, right?

505
00:31:53,910 --> 00:32:00,120
Scott: But the point is that this guy is as good as a fictional Theoretically super powered character at a thing.

506
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,750
Scott: Hence my analogies of Superman and Batman.

507
00:32:05,031 --> 00:32:08,284

Rym: what that means is you can only run games from the people who are hosting it the triad I'm for it.

530
00:33:17,077 --> 00:33:21,422
Rym: Yep, and You have to run a game to play in a game.

531
00:33:21,482 --> 00:33:23,190
Rym: You can't even attend if you're not running, right?

532
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:28,515
Scott: There's multiple sessions per day and you basically if you go both days You have to you.

533
00:33:28,535 --> 00:33:33,970
Scott: basically you're gonna run one session at some point on day one or day two And then the rest of the sessions you just play.

534
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:39,650
Rym: So it's gonna be a great time if any of you are going to be there Great time the last two times because we will be there.

Scott: I'm running again as I have run many times at events like this into the mountain the arc of Running a scenario that I'm still polishing, you know minds about and it's still not gonna be fully polished.

536
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,939
Scott: I'm gonna basically finish polishing it when it's being played.

537
00:33:54,019 --> 00:33:57,050
Rym: Mine is about an arc filled with obscenities.

538
00:33:57,877 --> 00:34:06,453
Scott: mine is about a. You're basically a bunch of merchants in a town and this is a knigget and he kills an awesome monster of some kind and has A mad treasure.

539
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:10,110
Scott: He brings the treasure back to the town and all the merchants fucking want it.

540
00:34:10,531 --> 00:34:15,210
Rym: The last time I ran into the mountain the entire party died, but felt very satisfied.

541
00:34:16,271 --> 00:34:25,670
Rym: The time before that the party destroyed the entire world and the time before that I think they all died screaming Mmm, like I think every one of them was screaming when they died anyway.

542
00:34:26,891 --> 00:34:28,597
Scott: But yeah, I know some burning con.

543
00:34:28,618 --> 00:34:33,609
Scott: a lot of people sort of chicken out because they're afraid to run a game Even if they really know how to play.

544
00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:37,820
Rym: Seriously, I go to a lot of cons man up pussies.

545
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:42,733
Rym: best majority of people who run games at conventions suck Acid.

546
00:34:42,753 --> 00:34:44,762

00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:49,820
Scott: you know, people really suck at this shit.

549
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,245
Rym: You will not stand out.

550
00:34:51,344 --> 00:34:52,949
Scott: even the people you think are really good.

551
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:53,954
Scott: No, they suck too.

552
00:34:53,974 --> 00:34:54,797
Scott: There's like said Luke Ryan.

553
00:34:54,817 --> 00:34:55,259
Rym: He's really good.

554
00:34:55,279 --> 00:34:56,784
Scott: It's like three people who are any good.

555
00:34:57,226 --> 00:35:02,756
Scott: Yeah, everyone else sucks also And you know what?

556
00:35:03,139 --> 00:35:04,570
Rym: I think I'm pretty shit your shit.

557
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:07,930
Scott: There's a. I've been told I'm a shit and I thought I was shit.

558
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:11,223
Scott: But then once I was told I was good only one time or two times.

559
00:35:11,344 --> 00:35:21,200
Rym: I was told at the last Two recesses ago three recess some some recess that I ran the best game The one of the people had ever played in a recess ever.

560
00:35:21,501 --> 00:35:23,490
Rym: Anyway, I was very proud of that.

561
00:35:24,411 --> 00:35:31,706
Scott: There is a beginners track which I guess you may or may not be able to still sign up for Where you actually spend one day learning in one day playing.

562
00:35:31,746 --> 00:35:32,450
Scott: so that's not too bad.

563
00:35:33,372 --> 00:35:36,229
Scott: If you don't know what you do and and you're a pussy, it's gonna be a good time.

00:35:44,998 --> 00:35:45,680
Scott: I don't know whatever.

567
00:35:45,801 --> 00:35:48,390

586
00:36:23,946 --> 00:36:24,890
Scott: you're slow at reading.

587
00:36:25,332 --> 00:36:28,404
Scott: This is why you need to read and not listen to audiobooks.

588
00:36:28,424 --> 00:36:29,790
Scott: You'll get faster and better at reading.

589
00:36:29,951 --> 00:36:31,563
Rym: I am 10% of the way through this book.

590
00:36:31,643 --> 00:36:34,975
Scott: I started it yesterday Thumbs up or thumbs down.

591
00:36:34,995 --> 00:36:36,280

Scott: kvot or I think it's kvothe.

595
00:36:43,356 --> 00:36:44,500
Scott: It's how it's supposed to be pronounced.

596
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:47,008
Rym: Well, he said it's pronounced similarly to quotes.

597
00:36:47,108 --> 00:36:48,126
Scott: Yeah quote.

598
00:36:49,976 --> 00:36:50,803
Scott: I think it's close.

599
00:36:51,005 --> 00:36:51,328
Rym: You know what?

600
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:54,968
Scott: kvothe reshy sure the guy.

601
00:36:55,029 --> 00:36:57,486
Rym: so There's some things I can say early on.

602
00:36:58,151 --> 00:37:03,146
Rym: Getting some slightly homoerotic vibes from him and his student in the early parts of the book.

603
00:37:03,367 --> 00:37:06,257
Rym: Okay, whatever whatever I'm just saying getting some vibes there.

604
00:37:06,297 --> 00:37:14,160
Rym: Yeah, those vibes to chronicler reminds me a lot of Danilothon from the some frog out in the realms books.

605
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,404
Scott: Well, I don't know that character.

606
00:37:15,464 --> 00:37:16,668
Rym: No, but he's a lot like that guy.

607
00:37:16,688 --> 00:37:21,029
Rym: Okay Three who would win in a fight kvothe or Kellis?

608
00:37:22,594 --> 00:37:23,423
Scott: kvothe or Kellis?

609
00:37:23,464 --> 00:37:27,017
Scott: Yeah Kellis, it depends.

610
00:37:27,038 --> 00:37:40,982
Scott: Yeah, because yeah, it depends because Of course this but these books right all three of them only two of which are out are the story of kvothe from his youth to his older days.

611
00:37:41,002 --> 00:37:45,941
Rym: Yeah, because kvothe could kill like kvothe when he was just one of the enemaru.

612
00:37:46,042 --> 00:37:51,703
Scott: It's like at it's edmera I think but it's like which point in each of their lives, right?

613
00:37:51,764 --> 00:37:53,510
Scott: It's like yeah, who's gonna win in a fight?

614
00:37:53,891 --> 00:37:55,517
Scott: Merlin or Lancelot?

615
00:37:55,557 --> 00:38:03,410
Scott: Well Merlin probably right, but no, it's super old Merlin Who's actually a baby versus super young Merlin who's a knicket with swords and lances?

616
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:05,820
Scott: I think baby Merlin is gonna lose right.

617
00:38:06,142 --> 00:38:06,645
Scott: so you got it.

618
00:38:06,665 --> 00:38:07,570
Scott: You got to pick a time.

619
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,598
Rym: Well the same time it depends on how.

620
00:38:09,759 --> 00:38:12,490
Scott: we also don't know the full timeline of either character.

621
00:38:13,132 --> 00:38:15,919
Rym: Does kvothe have the mark like?

622
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,262
Rym: well also kvothe.

623
00:38:17,603 --> 00:38:18,526
Rym: there's a lot of names.

624
00:38:18,786 --> 00:38:20,210
Scott: I know you mean coty.

625
00:38:24,492 --> 00:38:25,535
Rym: This book likes to throw.

626
00:38:25,556 --> 00:38:31,922
Rym: I like that this when he starts telling the story and he's like three days and then he's like Some may know me as he starts listing.

627
00:38:31,962 --> 00:38:37,442
Rym: like all these names The bloodless King killer have to do one damage, right?

628
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:39,910
Scott: Yeah, but book one is day one book Tuesday to book Thursday.

629
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:40,693
Rym: I'm liking it.

630
00:38:40,793 --> 00:38:41,115
Rym: Okay.

631
00:38:41,215 --> 00:38:43,584
Rym: It's not as artfully put together as the Prince of Nothing.

632
00:38:43,645 --> 00:38:44,990
Rym: Nor is it is deeply philosophical.

633
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:52,150
Rym: It's given me that good fantasy vibe, which is hard to get going in my blood.

634
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:56,824
Scott: So anyway, and then the final meta we have an IRC channel.

635
00:38:56,864 --> 00:38:57,445

640
00:39:22,016 --> 00:39:22,679

Rym: Also, if I get more Twitter followers than Scott by the end of the year I will upload a video of my junk to YouTube.

646
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,890
Scott: Yeah your junk meaning your boat.

647
00:39:36,111 --> 00:39:37,698
Rym: I think everyone knows what I mean by my.

648
00:39:37,718 --> 00:39:39,165
Scott: you're not allowed to upload videos of it.

649
00:39:39,487 --> 00:39:40,170
Rym: Oh, I'm allowed.

650
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:42,819
Scott: I'm just get taken down and your account will be shut down.

651
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,124
Rym: No, I looked into that.

652
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:45,610
Rym: most likely I'd get a strike.

653
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:52,184
Scott: Anyway You're better off just posting a photo of your junk to Imgur.

654
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:52,848
Scott: that'll stay there.

655
00:39:53,129 --> 00:39:55,643
Rym: now I'll upload a YouTube video that has a still of it in the middle.

656
00:39:55,744 --> 00:39:56,750
Rym: take a while for people to notice.

657
00:39:57,251 --> 00:39:58,395
Scott: Mmm, someone might report it.

658
00:39:58,737 --> 00:39:59,118
Rym: Yeah, they.

659
00:39:59,138 --> 00:40:02,650
Scott: probably there's also people who review every YouTube almost every YouTube video that goes up.

660
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:08,690
Rym: Anyway, anyway anyway, so traders of Genoa is a game that we played.

661
00:40:09,071 --> 00:40:10,256
Scott: But did we do things of the day?

662
00:40:10,316 --> 00:40:10,617
Scott: We did.

663
00:40:10,638 --> 00:40:11,200
Rym: Yeah, we did.

664
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,103
Rym: Okay with you.

665
00:40:12,123 --> 00:40:12,786
Scott: I'm forgetting.

666
00:40:12,806 --> 00:40:15,514
Rym: All right captain All right, then lead us off.

667
00:40:16,015 --> 00:40:20,770
Scott: Okay, so there's a game called traders of Genoa, but now is just called Genoa, right?

668
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:21,292
Scott: I played.

669
00:40:21,312 --> 00:40:23,243
Scott: there's a. it was an original printing in the u.s.

670
00:40:23,303 --> 00:40:24,430
Scott: Is it traders general on it?

671
00:40:24,751 --> 00:40:31,710
Scott: I played that a long time ago back in Beacon Poughkeepsie actually at Maas and then some reason I didn't go to that Maas meeting.

672
00:40:31,891 --> 00:40:34,707
Scott: Yeah, that guy remember he went to his apartment.

673
00:40:34,727 --> 00:40:35,230
Scott: He was there.

674
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:39,847
Scott: He played it with us, but it was brought by this red-haired guy with the apartment with the bird.

675
00:40:39,867 --> 00:40:44,850
Rym: Yes Okay, I played shadows over Camelot and then there were like the two cool people in town.

676
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:47,924
Scott: But there was that there was another cool person who you did not see.

677
00:40:47,944 --> 00:40:49,230
Scott: that was there the red-haired guy.

678
00:40:49,451 --> 00:40:51,200
Rym: Yeah, I never played a game with him.

679
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,090
Scott: He owned traders in Genoa and he played at that time.

680
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:56,703
Rym: How come the three cool people literally disappeared and we had no context?

681
00:40:56,924 --> 00:40:58,469
Scott: Oh, that's he get for not going every time.

682
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:02,164
Rym: No, but we they disappeared and somehow we had no way to think.

683
00:41:02,264 --> 00:41:03,770
Scott: I have a business card from one of the guys.

684
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:04,535
Rym: You should email them.

685
00:41:04,555 --> 00:41:08,009
Rym: be like, hey, you're still in Poughkeepsie anyway.

686
00:41:09,151 --> 00:41:16,330
Scott: So I played the game then and the whole gist of the game Is that it's a game where all the bits in the game are tradable, right?

687
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:22,689
Scott: So it's like, you know, you play Monopoly and it's like you're not really allowed to just trade money with people, right?

688
00:41:23,052 --> 00:41:23,760
Scott: It's like you can.

689
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,710
Scott: I guess it's in the rules.

690
00:41:24,771 --> 00:41:25,961
Scott: You can trade properties.

691
00:41:26,142 --> 00:41:36,288
Scott: and it's like, you know A lot of games that have trading a really respect even have trading at all have like credibly you can trade Resources for resources in a very constrained.

692
00:41:36,348 --> 00:41:43,290
Scott: Yeah There are very few games that have ultra freeform trading and traders in Genoa also does not have completely freeform trading.

693
00:41:43,633 --> 00:41:49,230
Scott: You can only trade with the person whose turn it is Right and you can only make trades that are binding and immediate.

694
00:41:49,311 --> 00:41:56,752
Scott: The only other kind of trade you can make that's binding is If somebody is going to go into a workshop and this will make no sense If you've never played it.

695
00:41:57,094 --> 00:41:59,120
Scott: you can trade with them for the goods.

696
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,648
Scott: The workshop would produce when they go into it, right?

697
00:42:02,009 --> 00:42:05,699
Scott: So Other than that, you can't really do anything.

698
00:42:05,779 --> 00:42:08,910
Scott: But the interesting thing is all the different pieces in the game.

699
00:42:09,251 --> 00:42:17,790
Scott: You know the cardboard pieces cards tokens money Recent goods, you know all the different kinds of bits and there's a bunch of them.

700
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:21,684
Scott: There's like four or five six different kinds of bits can all be traded.

701
00:42:21,704 --> 00:42:32,130
Scott: so you can be like I'll give you $3 and a tree for your Contract and a beer, you know you can really go crazy with that.

702
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:35,570
Scott: And that is the core of the fun and awesomeness of this game.

703
00:42:36,393 --> 00:42:41,450
Scott: So it's had a recent reprinting in the United States and where it's just called Genoa instead of traders in Genoa.

704
00:42:41,771 --> 00:42:48,099
Scott: But it is the exact same goddamn game as far as I can tell only newly printed with new art that kind of thing Going on bigger.

705
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:54,302
Scott: I think it's like larger In its construction, you know, I have no way to tell bigger board bigger pieces.

706
00:42:54,383 --> 00:42:58,858
Scott: I think I'm not a hundred percent sure But it's the same game and it's just as fun.

707
00:42:58,898 --> 00:43:01,910
Scott: and we own it and we've now both played it many more times.

708
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:08,490
Rym: Now the the gist of it's pretty simple you basically it's hard to really explain a lot of the bits without looking at a board.

709
00:43:08,691 --> 00:43:11,822
Rym: Basically you move around this board like you have a trail.

710
00:43:11,862 --> 00:43:17,722
Rym: you leave like a slime trail of traders and Every turn you're like trade der not trade toe.

711
00:43:17,782 --> 00:43:19,490
Rym: I could move it here or move it there.

712
00:43:20,054 --> 00:43:21,910
Rym: What do you guys want me to do and Scott will be like?

713
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:25,505
Rym: I'll give you a beer and five bucks if you move it there.

714
00:43:25,545 --> 00:43:31,530
Scott: and let me do the thing Right, because basically you move this train of discs around the board and they all have to be in a line.

715
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,621
Scott: But you could sort of you know, you follow a path.

716
00:43:33,962 --> 00:43:38,499
Scott: think of it as there is a guy He's walking around town doing errands in one day.

717
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:53,470
Scott: He can walk five squares, right and in those five squares He's gonna go into certain buildings and do errands in each of those buildings that he walks into Alright one person on is controlling the guy who walks around town and he moves all five spaces.

718
00:43:54,353 --> 00:44:00,814
Scott: Every time he goes into a building one of the players at the table gets to do the errand in that building But only once.

719
00:44:00,854 --> 00:44:05,430
Scott: so you can't normally do two different buildings in the same turn.

720
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:08,841
Scott: If I do the brewery, that's it for me this turn.

721
00:44:08,881 --> 00:44:11,530
Scott: I can't also do the City Hall in the same turn, right?

722
00:44:11,851 --> 00:44:19,967
Scott: So even though I'm controlling the guy walking around the town Only one of the buildings that I walk into I can keep I can do myself.

723
00:44:20,027 --> 00:44:21,574
Scott: the other buildings I walk into.

724
00:44:21,594 --> 00:44:30,430
Scott: other people at the table are gonna do those buildings Which means I need to get them to pay me to let them do those buildings or I can just end my turn immediately.

725
00:44:30,914 --> 00:44:40,350
Rym: Now if I haven't taken my action yet Like I'm the traitor or doing the thing if I haven't taken my action yet I could always be like, well, I'm gonna use it myself unless someone else gives me another bid.

726
00:44:40,791 --> 00:44:52,818
Rym: But if I come back if I'm gonna go into a place and someone actually does offer me like offers me something I have to take it or in my turn right like if no one at the table wants anything that's adjacent to Rym Right and I say Rym.

727
00:44:52,838 --> 00:44:55,109
Scott: I'll give you $1 for the thing next to you.

728
00:44:55,591 --> 00:45:01,090
Scott: He either has to say yes and let me have it or do it himself or end his turn.

729
00:45:01,191 --> 00:45:03,089
Scott: Those are the only three options available to him.

730
00:45:03,752 --> 00:45:16,467
Rym: now the other cool thing about this game is like Scott said you can trade anything for anything and there's a spatial clue like component of what's close to what and moving around and then there's all these different bits like you can get a contract

731
00:45:16,627 --> 00:45:16,848
Scott: yep,

732
00:45:17,269 --> 00:45:19,155
Rym: which you which has like.

733
00:45:19,235 --> 00:45:33,130
Rym: there's things that have to do with having like a number of contracts adjacent to each other or like deals were like get these particular combinations of goods and then cash them in at this place or Have the trader go between this place and this place in one turn.

734
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:35,637
Rym: So you have hidden information of.

735
00:45:36,018 --> 00:45:37,162
Rym: here are my goals.

736
00:45:37,182 --> 00:45:46,550
Rym: that will get me a bunch of money and everyone else has their own hidden Goals and you're all trying to negotiate to maximize your own goals and minimize the goals of others.

737
00:45:48,154 --> 00:45:49,890
Scott: But did I mention that the way to win this game?

738
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:51,960
Scott: The only thing that matters is at the very end.

739
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:53,990
Scott: How much money do you have, right?

740
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:55,249
Scott: That's all that matters at the end.

741
00:45:55,310 --> 00:46:02,330
Scott: And of course at the end of the game a lot of some of the things you have like contracts can be converted into Money straight up depending on you know what you have.

742
00:46:02,692 --> 00:46:05,130
Scott: But a lot of the things are worth no money at the end of the game.

743
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:07,790
Scott: Like if you just have a beer sitting there at the end of the game, it's worth nothing.

744
00:46:08,192 --> 00:46:11,630
Scott: There might be some tiebreakers involving things like that, but I'm not sure what they are.

745
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:12,788
Scott: I don't have the rules in front of me.

746
00:46:13,331 --> 00:46:20,430
Scott: So really it's all about just getting as much money as possible and all these other bits are just means of getting money.

747
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:26,150
Scott: Now a lot of them if you get them in the right combinations in time could be worth like a hundred bucks.

748
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:29,603
Scott: So like if you're get some Rym is like he really wants a beer.

749
00:46:29,784 --> 00:46:31,390
Scott: I see as a large contract.

750
00:46:32,054 --> 00:46:34,910
Scott: I know that with that beer he could potentially get a hundred bucks.

751
00:46:35,351 --> 00:46:36,255
Scott: So I'm gonna be like Rym.

752
00:46:36,556 --> 00:46:40,128
Scott: this beer is basically, you know, it's what's it actually worth in the game.

753
00:46:40,209 --> 00:46:46,350
Scott: overall It may be ten, you know, who knows what but to you at this moment in time it is worth a hundred dollars.

754
00:46:47,053 --> 00:46:51,432
Scott: So if you want it, you're going to have to pay out the nose Right.

755
00:46:51,793 --> 00:46:54,885
Scott: It's like it's worth, you know, at least fifty right?

756
00:46:54,925 --> 00:47:02,170
Scott: Cuz that'll be sort of fair But I want to win so I'll give you give me sixty four Right, and that's the kind of shit that goes on in this game.

757
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:11,630
Scott: It's like oh if someone else wanted the beer I'd be like oh ten bucks cuz I know that you only have a small Contract which means the most you could get from this beer would be thirty, you know.

758
00:47:11,751 --> 00:47:22,270
Scott: So that all that kind of stuff comes into play where you're looking at what the other guy has To figure out how much the thing is worth to them now as opposed to how much something is worth on a global market.

759
00:47:22,451 --> 00:47:24,850
Rym: Now what's interesting is that this game shares?

760
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:29,849
Rym: Two very important aspects with another game that we play a lot and I think we've talked about on the show modern art.

761
00:47:30,591 --> 00:47:37,088
Rym: One the one of the mediums you use for bidding and trading is also victory points in both games.

762
00:47:37,549 --> 00:47:40,240
Rym: and two Both games get around.

763
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:52,163
Rym: the settlers problem of it's not act Like no one actually wants to trade or do business because in both this game and modern art The mechanics basically force you to trade new business.

764
00:47:52,183 --> 00:48:01,609
Scott: I think the other game that does that of course is bizarre Bonanza - right it's people if you're playing out trading right points, right?

765
00:48:01,689 --> 00:48:05,283
Scott: No, that's It forced you to trade right does is that you?

766
00:48:05,363 --> 00:48:08,053
Scott: if you have a game where there is trading People?

767
00:48:08,073 --> 00:48:14,170
Scott: if it's if it's just freeform trading there is no reason to trade with anyone unless you're ripping them off.

768
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:24,699
Scott: Therefore right if all players playing are smart and it is not possible to rip anyone off because anyone will reject a ripoff trade No one will trade.

769
00:48:24,981 --> 00:48:27,318
Scott: but trading is fun And you that's part of the.

770
00:48:27,419 --> 00:48:46,327
Scott: that's why settlers isn't fun Or very fun when you have good players because no one trades and the whole fun of the game is like brick for wood All right, so in order to have a fun game for smart people with trading that is fun You need something to force people to make it a good idea to trade even if you're not getting ripped off.

771
00:48:46,729 --> 00:48:47,030
Scott: and what?

772
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:53,104
Scott: Genoa does to make that happen is they give you multiple opportunities when it's your turn to where?

773
00:48:53,566 --> 00:48:55,290
Scott: sure your turn could end right here.

774
00:48:55,410 --> 00:49:03,979
Scott: But if you go and you walk your little guy and you move the tower into other buildings Allowing other people to run errands in those buildings.

775
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:09,818
Scott: they will pay you and you will get resources this turn You know right now that you could use.

776
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,350
Scott: if you end the turn you're not getting anything for the rest of this turn.

777
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:18,550
Scott: So even though you're helping other people you will also be helping yourself in this turn versus ending it right now.

778
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:27,930
Scott: and if everyone just went to one building and ended their turn on every single action if One person didn't do that that person be pretty much guaranteed to win because all the extra stuff they be getting.

779
00:49:28,931 --> 00:49:32,081
Scott: So it's a good idea to let people pay you to do things.

780
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:41,818
Rym: games like this really put into stark contrast games that involve trading but don't either don't facilitate people actually trading or the trading like the other way around.

781
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:43,143
Rym: the no one trades and settlers.

782
00:49:43,223 --> 00:49:44,609
Rym: if it turns into the vote who wins game?

783
00:49:44,669 --> 00:49:52,010
Rym: where You know you people trade or don't trade based on who they like or they're the politicals or the heuristics.

784
00:49:52,131 --> 00:49:56,990
Rym: Right you're reading the Richard Garfield book yet Can I start using the terminology from it instead of our own time?

785
00:49:57,050 --> 00:50:00,870
Scott: I'm gonna start reading it soon cuz I just finished the book because what we call vote who wins games?

786
00:50:00,970 --> 00:50:02,416
Rym: He calls the chip taking game.

787
00:50:02,476 --> 00:50:04,043
Scott: I won't describe the chip taking game.

788
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:04,545
Scott: Is it a sim?

789
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:05,870
Scott: is one of the simple example game.

790
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:11,761
Rym: Yeah, so the chip taking game shows how some games Because of the mechanics the.

791
00:50:11,781 --> 00:50:13,129
Rym: now here's another thing.

792
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:17,862
Rym: Particularly, this is a flaw in games that involve direct fucking.

793
00:50:18,263 --> 00:50:20,690
Rym: Yep, which is what we call he calls it something else.

794
00:50:21,192 --> 00:50:26,610
Rym: But direct fucking is a game like Vinci where I can attack Scott the player directly in the game.

795
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:28,477
Scott: that is true that is that has a lot of vote.

796
00:50:28,497 --> 00:50:29,501
Scott: who wins aspects?

797
00:50:29,722 --> 00:50:32,251
Rym: so games that have direct fucking tend to have vote.

798
00:50:32,532 --> 00:50:33,635
Rym: who wins ideas?

799
00:50:33,835 --> 00:50:35,420
Scott: right because if you just you can choose.

800
00:50:35,921 --> 00:50:41,457
Scott: if you're playing say three four players you choose who you attack and Whoever you attack your vote.

801
00:50:41,478 --> 00:50:43,226
Scott: You're basically voting for them to lose now.

802
00:50:43,246 --> 00:50:44,150
Scott: They're falling behind.

803
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:45,275
Rym: So here's the chip taking game.

804
00:50:45,355 --> 00:50:47,504
Rym: every round everyone has an action.

805
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:47,906
Rym: Well.

806
00:50:47,926 --> 00:50:48,830
Scott: What do you have at the beginning?

807
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:54,207
Rym: Yeah, so everyone starts with ten chips and on your round you choose one person take a chip away from them and throw it in the garbage.

808
00:50:54,931 --> 00:50:59,910
Rym: Whoever is the last man standing with any chips wins the game, so wouldn't you just always so round one?

809
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:00,754
Scott: How many people are playing?

810
00:51:00,774 --> 00:51:04,050
Rym: let's say you me and Scott Johnson three, okay?

811
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:05,795
Scott: So round one I take from Scott Johnson.

812
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:10,590
Scott: round two you're not gonna take from you know Scott Johnson cuz you already down one.

813
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:11,894
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna take from yourselves.

814
00:51:11,914 --> 00:51:15,745
Scott: you take from me, and then Scott Johnson takes from you.

815
00:51:15,765 --> 00:51:21,421
Scott: so basically whoever Went It depend you know depending on the turn order.

816
00:51:21,762 --> 00:51:25,439
Scott: right we're basically so we're all down to one And then it's someone's turn.

817
00:51:25,459 --> 00:51:26,806
Scott: I guess I went first right.

818
00:51:27,288 --> 00:51:32,643
Scott: so now I'm voting either Rym or Scott Johnson will be eliminated and then so I eliminate.

819
00:51:32,763 --> 00:51:34,127
Scott: say Scott Johnson.

820
00:51:34,147 --> 00:51:37,739
Scott: then on your turn you eliminate me Or I eliminate you and then Scott Johnson eliminates me.

821
00:51:37,759 --> 00:51:38,322
Scott: now look you can.

822
00:51:38,342 --> 00:51:39,145
Rym: now here's the problem.

823
00:51:39,165 --> 00:51:43,192
Rym: you iterate through that the game is either set or Who?

824
00:51:43,413 --> 00:51:48,548
Scott: if it's arbitrary what if it's simultaneous voting to which chip to remove?

825
00:51:48,809 --> 00:51:56,121
Scott: yeah But even then right cuz then at round one we both we all reveal our votes And we mean you both mean you both vote Scott Johnson now.

826
00:51:56,141 --> 00:52:01,435
Scott: He's down, too, so then in the second round well You're not gonna vote Scott Johnson again You're gonna vote me and I'm gonna vote you.

827
00:52:01,877 --> 00:52:03,502
Scott: cuz we just both voted Scott John.

828
00:52:03,542 --> 00:52:10,786
Scott: so think about Johnson's gonna pick one of us Again, so think about this one of the game like this now other one of us in a game like this.

829
00:52:10,846 --> 00:52:17,429
Rym: now the person Who's ahead isn't necessarily the person with the most chips cuz that's the person who's going to be fucked the most right.

830
00:52:17,449 --> 00:52:21,123
Scott: you would be Thinking at least one or two rounds ahead of who's someone gonna vote for right?

831
00:52:21,143 --> 00:52:24,583
Scott: cuz you know in round one We both voted for Scott Johnson.

832
00:52:24,623 --> 00:52:25,369
Scott: He's down to eight.

833
00:52:26,034 --> 00:52:27,845
Scott: He voted for me, so I'm down to nine.

834
00:52:27,865 --> 00:52:28,589
Scott: you're still at ten.

835
00:52:28,991 --> 00:52:34,229
Scott: So I'm gonna vote for you, and he's probably also gonna vote for you, and then you're gonna vote for me.

836
00:52:34,812 --> 00:52:35,818
Scott: Right so then we're all dead.

837
00:52:36,341 --> 00:52:38,010
Scott: so, but then I know that you were doing.

838
00:52:38,512 --> 00:52:43,230
Rym: The determining factor of the game is either arbitrary political bullshit or attack Rym.

839
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:49,850
Scott: He's gonna win right, but it also you get a little bit especially when the chips are getting low like when someone has two chips.

840
00:52:50,291 --> 00:52:57,030
Scott: Suddenly it becomes the stick game of unstable state because if you only have two chips you could theoretically be eliminated that immediately.

841
00:52:57,030 --> 00:52:58,556
Rym: Well, no, then it doesn't become the stick game.

842
00:52:58,597 --> 00:53:05,883
Rym: It becomes the game is already over game Or it becomes the brinksmanship game of Scott.

843
00:53:05,903 --> 00:53:06,726
Rym: if you don't attack him.

844
00:53:06,786 --> 00:53:07,469
Rym: He's gonna win.

845
00:53:07,529 --> 00:53:10,190
Rym: so Which is a problem in many games basically?

846
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:15,288
Scott: I'm in two and you're both at one the only chance you guys has of winning is if you both vote for me.

847
00:53:15,308 --> 00:53:22,816
Rym: anyway the Terminology that Garfield uses one of you will die because I'm attacking only one is that these Many games just boil down to the like.

848
00:53:22,836 --> 00:53:24,179
Rym: the mechanics don't matter.

849
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:28,490
Rym: the actual decisions that matter are just which player do I attack?

850
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:30,153
Rym: Who do I fuck?

851
00:53:30,454 --> 00:53:35,750
Scott: and that's basically deciding which of the other players will lose and your own fate is out of your hands unless?

852
00:53:35,911 --> 00:53:39,849
Scott: You know you would obviously pick the person most likely to vote for you, but that's really all there is to it.

853
00:53:40,171 --> 00:53:45,965
Rym: So once again that you know just to kind of show how cool This book is just because it gives us terminology for all this stuff.

854
00:53:46,207 --> 00:53:46,750
Rym: look at settlers.

855
00:53:47,012 --> 00:53:49,710
Rym: I used to win settlers a lot in our crew before.

856
00:53:50,011 --> 00:53:55,690
Rym: Everyone got really good at settlers and the reason I was able to do it is that the settlers breaks down in that whoever's the?

857
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:56,111
Rym: Head.

858
00:53:56,633 --> 00:54:02,245
Rym: whenever the seven comes up everyone tries to gangbang on the person who's winning so they don't win to give everyone else a chance to catch up.

859
00:54:03,152 --> 00:54:16,090
Rym: So the key to the game was to lay low and be in second place with a non obvious way To jump ahead of the last second wimpy cards or longest road out of nowhere being close to having longest road and largest army.

860
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:21,230
Rym: But somehow other people don't notice because and here's the way you don't actually have them in front of you the game has.

861
00:54:21,991 --> 00:54:26,947
Rym: Other players have a poor model in their head of who's actually winning and that is the key.

862
00:54:26,987 --> 00:54:27,890
Scott: and traders of Genoa.

863
00:54:28,191 --> 00:54:38,150
Scott: It is really fucking hard to tell who is actually winning because somebody might be like hundreds of dollars behind you But they might be having a fistful of completed large contracts.

864
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:48,296
Scott: They just haven't cashed in yet and as soon as you get near via Paletti boom They just lay it out boom boom and they're just you know Cashing them in big time right at the end of the game now And there's nothing you can do about it.

865
00:54:48,316 --> 00:54:50,690
Rym: Here's where the game breaks down and that it's a little not fun.

866
00:54:51,211 --> 00:54:55,825
Rym: The big contracts are worth a hundred dinars ducats whatever the money is.

867
00:54:55,885 --> 00:54:59,318
Rym: yeah now the trouble with that Is that the you know these big contracts?

868
00:54:59,559 --> 00:55:03,342
Rym: There's four places where you can cash them in any time.

869
00:55:03,845 --> 00:55:08,924
Rym: a player Wants to go there and has at least three goods.

870
00:55:09,386 --> 00:55:17,590
Rym: everyone assumes Pretty much correctly that they have a big contract and demands a large portion of the profits.

871
00:55:18,072 --> 00:55:21,690
Rym: So it's a very predictable and unfun element of the game.

872
00:55:21,771 --> 00:55:23,650
Rym: There's no way to really bluff that well.

873
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:31,850
Scott: But the point is is that that person already paid out a whole bunch Along the way to even get those goods unless they were really lucky and the contract itself.

874
00:55:32,292 --> 00:55:34,845
Scott: So it's like then to pay out a huge portion of the profits.

875
00:55:34,885 --> 00:55:39,422
Scott: on the final end It's like on the large contract how much do you actually make?

876
00:55:39,843 --> 00:55:40,786
Scott: so you know.

877
00:55:40,947 --> 00:55:41,990
Scott: if you have to you know?

878
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:44,562
Rym: But I'm saying it the more you're going for.

879
00:55:44,622 --> 00:55:46,050
Rym: cashing it in is not fun.

880
00:55:46,872 --> 00:55:51,014
Scott: That's true among smart, and you don't even get a contract What's it called.

881
00:55:51,677 --> 00:56:01,770
Rym: so the only reason people go after those Or the only way people go after them is going after the things that let you teleport somewhere automatically.

882
00:56:02,252 --> 00:56:07,112
Rym: But then people realize that the game determinator Determiner.

883
00:56:07,332 --> 00:56:09,297
Rym: so people now treat that the same way.

884
00:56:09,338 --> 00:56:19,923
Rym: they treat the corners and you can see how the game that the negotiations around that especially among Smart but not necessarily well versed in the game players.

885
00:56:20,385 --> 00:56:21,610
Rym: It's just not super fun.

886
00:56:22,071 --> 00:56:25,384
Rym: It's super fun among really apt players who are also smart.

887
00:56:25,725 --> 00:56:35,270
Rym: It's not fun among Inexperienced players who are smart, but it is fun again If there's a new inexperienced and on the smart players, and you're taking advantage of the nubs exactly.

888
00:56:36,451 --> 00:56:40,110
Rym: Yeah, I mean, it's like you know, but that gets into the the classic example.

889
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:43,695
Scott: And then there's the whole thing where like they'll be enough doing something dumb And they'll be helping out.

890
00:56:43,735 --> 00:56:47,110
Scott: say Rym and I'll try to educate the nub and say look you're about to give Rym all this.

891
00:56:47,231 --> 00:56:48,480
Rym: Whatever guys advise it.

892
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,749
Scott: What's going on you want to do?

893
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:52,179
Rym: He's lying and trying to win advice.

894
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:54,790
Scott: Rym is the person who lies and Scott never lies.

895
00:56:54,971 --> 00:57:02,407
Rym: And you know what the result of that is someone other than me and Scott wins the game like that Possibly, but then I win because that's because you didn't listen to me.

896
00:57:02,427 --> 00:57:14,709
Scott: Yeah If I tell you that the move rims about to make is gonna earn him that much money and that you should ask him for Four victory points and Scott has a fistful of beer and whatever and that's how these games.

897
00:57:14,729 --> 00:57:15,637
Scott: yeah It's only beer.

898
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:17,673
Scott: you can't do anything with just beer You know what?

899
00:57:17,733 --> 00:57:24,508
Rym: if you're a German style euro board gamer type and you like these kinds of games Jenna was on the you might as well own it list.

900
00:57:24,589 --> 00:57:37,522
Scott: yeah I mean the fact that you can trade anything for anything You know makes this game a whole lot of fun for the vast majority of people who like to play strategic games You know and it can only really be unfun for you.

901
00:57:37,743 --> 00:57:49,409
Scott: if a you don't like trading at all be your it's basically everyone at the table is me and Rym me and Rym or And you do all play like assholes and everyone knows everything.

902
00:57:49,449 --> 00:57:50,573
Scott: now It's actively.

903
00:57:50,613 --> 00:57:58,160
Rym: despite looking like what I see you none of you are smart enough to actually understand the game looks Complex like and Decker if you just look at it.

904
00:57:58,321 --> 00:57:58,441
Scott: No.

905
00:57:58,502 --> 00:57:58,723
Scott: It's.

906
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:00,530
Scott: it's one of those deceptively simple game.

907
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:05,527
Rym: Yeah, if you if you have someone else teach you the rules the game is rid dick.

908
00:58:05,588 --> 00:58:06,250
Rym: simple to learn.

909
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:06,912
Scott: I hate all these.

910
00:58:07,033 --> 00:58:07,434
Scott: that's one.

911
00:58:07,494 --> 00:58:12,129
Rym: now the game sucks to learn if nobody at the table already knows how to play.

912
00:58:12,269 --> 00:58:17,141
Scott: one thing I really hate about a lot of games lately I've noticed is like you know a gregola or this.

913
00:58:17,422 --> 00:58:20,313
Rym: or if someone teaches you how to play It's a unit.

914
00:58:20,333 --> 00:58:20,855
Scott: it's great.

915
00:58:20,935 --> 00:58:24,166
Scott: even if someone teaches you it's like they teach you so many things.

916
00:58:24,307 --> 00:58:25,673
Scott: you can't leave anything out Right.

917
00:58:26,016 --> 00:58:46,884
Scott: so they teach you all these rules And it takes a long time no matter how even if you're super fast learners And they go over all these different bits and cards and all these things and then when you actually play It's like oh, this is really actually fast and simple and most of those rules I had to learn don't come into play very often and When they do I sort of know them now, and it makes sense.

918
00:58:47,125 --> 00:58:48,290
Scott: and this game is way.

919
00:58:48,611 --> 00:58:52,065
Scott: You know it's interesting, but explaining the rules was not easy at all.

920
00:58:52,266 --> 00:59:00,486
Rym: one of the examples Carfield's bug that it I never thought of because like hard to teach easy to play because I don't like.

921
00:59:01,028 --> 00:59:05,250
Rym: I used to play games Like cribbage bridge and whatever and I really don't like games like that anymore.

922
00:59:06,012 --> 00:59:15,596
Rym: I like hearts inexplicably, and I enjoy Euchre, but I only enjoy Euchre if I cheat at it, but anyway, so the the idea of The people who's

923
00:59:15,636 --> 00:59:19,113
Scott: every show about board games actually going to be a review of the stupid book now Until

924
00:59:19,173 --> 00:59:22,129
Rym: you read it and I can just start using the terminology from the book.

925
00:59:22,732 --> 00:59:26,290
Rym: Granted I like our term direct fucking more than his terms.

926
00:59:26,391 --> 00:59:27,529
Rym: I think I'm gonna keep using that one.

927
00:59:28,432 --> 00:59:45,879
Rym: But so if you want people who teach that game who understand that game will usually also teach bidding systems in bridge which are the Systems of bidding to indicate to the other player whether or not you have a good hand and what they should do and all that Bullshit, which is crucial to playing

928
00:59:45,939 --> 00:59:47,062
Scott: bridge without cheating.

929
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:57,065
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time Really Really confuses new players and really obfuscates what the core mechanics of bridge are.

930
00:59:57,586 --> 00:59:58,850
Scott: and really don't you know?

931
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:07,122
Scott: I don't even really know the full rules of bridge but like the the scant details I do know they make it seem like wow, that's fucking stupid.

932
01:00:07,182 --> 01:00:07,362
Scott: right.

933
01:00:07,422 --> 01:00:08,084
Scott: what it's like?

934
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:11,749
Scott: if there's a special signaling system We're like you can't communicate but you can bid.

935
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:18,724
Scott: So if I bid 10 and that's a signal to my partner to do a certain thing now Don't the other players know what that signal is too?

936
01:00:18,765 --> 01:00:19,630
Scott: because it's a well-known?

937
01:00:19,791 --> 01:00:20,896
Rym: Yes, so then the game.

938
01:00:20,916 --> 01:00:22,042
Rym: so then it's Street Fighter.

939
01:00:22,062 --> 01:00:32,483
Rym: you have this high-level game of Using increasingly complex bidding systems or using a bidding system to bluff So the other team but then wouldn't my partner know?

940
01:00:32,603 --> 01:00:40,623
Scott: not and if I'm trying to bluff and you know You're not allowed to communicate so I try to fool the other players that are on the other team But I end up fooling my own partner and we fuck ourselves.

941
01:00:40,643 --> 01:00:41,809
Rym: You got to trust the other player.

942
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:45,950
Rym: We mean trust that they understand the bidding systems enough.

943
01:00:46,871 --> 01:00:48,238
Scott: It's it's it's you know, it's like.

944
01:00:48,318 --> 01:00:50,550
Scott: I think it's just nonsense to me.

945
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:55,050
Rym: I'll be honest games like bridge are taking a deck of cards and doing too much with it.

946
01:00:56,034 --> 01:00:56,899
Scott: I get that I haven't.

947
01:00:56,939 --> 01:01:01,950
Scott: I don't know the rules of bridge and I know a lot I used to play is a lot of advanced bridge out there.

948
01:01:02,211 --> 01:01:09,752
Scott: I heard sort of water is but I just don't know enough about it to really make a you know an informed Judgment.

949
01:01:09,972 --> 01:01:11,838
Rym: I just I don't enjoy games like that anymore.

950
01:01:11,858 --> 01:01:14,285
Rym: I don't enjoy trick-taking games with bidding systems.

951
01:01:14,305 --> 01:01:18,621
Rym: I Like hearts - yeah, but hearts is also.

952
01:01:18,902 --> 01:01:20,790
Rym: we get to be ever done a show on hearts.

953
01:01:20,971 --> 01:01:21,975
Scott: We do a whole show at.

954
01:01:22,155 --> 01:01:23,942
Rym: I could do a whole fucking show on hearts.

955
01:01:23,962 --> 01:01:24,806
Rym: You shut your mouth.

956
01:01:24,846 --> 01:01:33,583
Rym: Microsoft hearts front row crew calm archive Hearts Hearts.

957
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:40,471
Rym: So we did a special on it on September 11 2007. there you go Huh?

958
01:01:40,933 --> 01:01:42,659
Scott: He knows he's already like two years old.

959
01:01:42,759 --> 01:01:44,846
Rym: I know hearts is a good game now.

960
01:01:44,947 --> 01:01:47,193
Scott: It's Seven years old.

961
01:01:47,374 --> 01:01:48,176
Rym: Anyway, I think we're done.

962
01:01:48,196 --> 01:01:49,720
Rym: You know what Genoa it's.

963
01:01:50,001 --> 01:01:50,141
Rym: it's.

964
01:01:50,382 --> 01:01:54,857
Rym: if you care about German style of art games You should own Genoa.

965
01:01:54,897 --> 01:01:57,930
Scott: Yeah, if you're the entry shelf, this is like there with Puerto Rico.

966
01:01:58,273 --> 01:02:00,530
Scott: This is like the second is the second tier right?

967
01:02:00,570 --> 01:02:05,950
Scott: Like if you are already, you know, if you're hardcore in the European board games, this is the second tier game.

968
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:06,572
Scott: You got to get it.

969
01:02:06,813 --> 01:02:10,990
Scott: But if you're a dabbler or a newbie or whatever, this is not the first tier.

970
01:02:11,131 --> 01:02:12,899
Scott: So it should not be one of the first games you buy.

971
01:02:12,919 --> 01:02:21,170
Scott: you should but like once you've already covered Like the a-plus games and you're looking for more then Jenna was one of the first games you should go start to look at.

972
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:24,835
Scott: I mean, it's board game geek rank 172 out of many thousands.

973
01:02:25,256 --> 01:02:26,219
Scott: It's not bad.

974
01:02:26,239 --> 01:02:31,989
Scott: I actually really kind of want to play end decker again now With the huts, the huts are the only good part.

975
01:02:32,291 --> 01:02:35,608
Rym: No, fuck the huts you think is you say the huts is the good part.

976
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:36,572
Rym: one They're not.

977
01:02:36,632 --> 01:02:39,083
Rym: and two, how come you always fuck up the huts?

978
01:02:39,385 --> 01:02:40,550
Scott: I'm not gonna say I'm good at the huts.

979
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:41,575
Scott: I just really like that.

980
01:02:41,595 --> 01:02:44,790
Scott: there's little huts and they're hidden and you sort of walk these dudes over to go investigate.

981
01:02:44,810 --> 01:02:46,663
Rym: It's all the games all of our risk management.

982
01:02:46,683 --> 01:02:47,448
Scott: It's physically fun.

983
01:02:47,488 --> 01:02:48,148
Scott: the huts And you know what?

984
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:53,126
Rym: All the end deckers taught me in my entire life of playing it with smart people.

985
01:02:53,548 --> 01:03:00,310
Rym: is that one Humans fucking suck at pattern recognition and they fucking suck at managing risk.

986
01:03:07,424 --> 01:03:09,960
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
