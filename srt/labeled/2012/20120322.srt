1
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,115
Rym: It's Thursday March 22nd, 2012.

2
00:00:11,115 --> 00:00:12,999
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:13,901
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,022 --> 00:00:15,445
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,485 --> 00:00:17,550
Rym: Tonight, I talk a bit about my trip to India.

6
00:00:20,331 --> 00:00:21,348
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,257
Rym: So, you know, we're always kind of hard up more of a Tuesday thing to play hardcore board games.

8
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:36,262
Rym: Like, it's funny because I remember there was a time when we'd complain about the people who complained about that because we could always just get a game going.

9
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:40,800
Rym: But, uh, it's surprisingly more difficult just with doing more stuff.

10
00:00:41,621 --> 00:00:45,900
Rym: So we have our own, like, private board game night independent of all these other, like, board game things we do in the city.

11
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,668
Scott: And even then it's still hard to get real games.

12
00:00:47,769 --> 00:00:50,080
Rym: Because basically one person shows up every other week.

13
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,146
Scott: Or too many people show up.

14
00:00:52,366 --> 00:00:56,080
Scott: And then, you know, the thing with hardcore games is that to play, it's weird.

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,612
Scott: It's like, most people have the problem of they have no friends.

16
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:00,736
Scott: At least most nerds.

17
00:01:00,897 --> 00:01:01,780
Scott: Or they have very few friends.

18
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,440
Scott: So if they want to play anything for reals, it's very difficult.

19
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,685
Scott: They can't even get a Mario party going on.

20
00:01:05,745 --> 00:01:09,400
Rym: Even if they have a lot of friends, the friends are not in the same physical location.

21
00:01:09,762 --> 00:01:10,003
Scott: Right.

22
00:01:10,506 --> 00:01:13,360
Scott: So, you know, to even have anyone is already lucky.

23
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:18,220
Scott: But it's like, in order to, you know, certain activities require very specific circumstances.

24
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:26,480
Scott: To play a hardcore board game, a German game, usually you need exactly three, four, five people.

25
00:01:26,721 --> 00:01:28,489
Scott: Usually four or five, right?

26
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,600
Scott: Four is mostly the optimal number.

27
00:01:31,062 --> 00:01:32,680
Scott: And you need to be in the same place.

28
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:38,000
Scott: You need to have, like, two or three hours of time set aside specifically for this without distractions.

29
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:42,696
Scott: And you all need to be dedicated and saying, "Yes, this is what we're gonna

30
00:01:42,716 --> 00:01:42,756
Scott: do.".

31
00:01:43,901 --> 00:01:52,673
Rym: But, at the same time... You know, we tried to make the hardcore, like, semi-private, like, it's like the high-class club, like, "Oh, you, sir, are a distinguished board gamer.

32
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:55,278
Rym: We will invite you to our private, fancy board game

33
00:01:55,298 --> 00:01:55,819
Rym: party!".

34
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:56,545
Rym: *sad noises*.

35
00:01:57,361 --> 00:02:01,733
Rym: But, uh, all the people we invite are just as busy with stuff as we are.

36
00:02:01,753 --> 00:02:02,676
Rym: It's like, "Oh, I can't come.

37
00:02:02,716 --> 00:02:03,578
Rym: I'm going to the night

38
00:02:03,618 --> 00:02:04,019
Rym: market.".

39
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:04,819
Scott: Yeah.

40
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,232
Rym: Which is actually pretty cool.

41
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:06,819
Rym: And anyway...

42
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:11,120
Scott: Or they show up and they just want to play, like, spot it and dix it and they don't want to play for serious.

43
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,720
Rym: So we tried the GeekNights Strategy, also known as the Penny Arcade Strategy.

44
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:27,060
Rym: If we scheduled our private board game night every other week, and we held it no matter what, and sometimes me and Scott would sit here, the two of us playing games.

45
00:02:27,221 --> 00:02:28,719
Rym: Usually, Chase would come, we'd have three.

46
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:33,540
Rym: But, uh, for whatever reason, last night was, like, the night.

47
00:02:33,681 --> 00:02:37,260
Rym: We had the exact right number of people to play two simultaneous sets of games.

48
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:40,440
Scott: Well, even so, the hardcore game only half-finished.

49
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,860
Scott: But it's a great game, by the way.

50
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,240
Rym: Yeah, Brass looks pretty good.

51
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:44,824
Scott: It's pretty great.

52
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:46,557
Scott: And the other game was not hardcore.

53
00:02:46,577 --> 00:02:46,819
Scott: It's Dixit.

54
00:02:47,261 --> 00:02:49,880
Rym: Yeah, we played some Dixit, and we played, uh, Cameltron.

55
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,494
Scott: Cameltron's somewhat hardcore.

56
00:02:51,515 --> 00:02:51,880
Scott: That's respectable.

57
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:58,420
Rym: The thing is, you know, the board game night also had a large social element, 'cause it'd been a while since we had a lot of people together, 'cause everyone's been busy.

58
00:02:59,581 --> 00:02:59,904
Scott: Indeed.

59
00:03:00,187 --> 00:03:01,399
Scott: But it's gonna be PAX real soon.

60
00:03:01,822 --> 00:03:02,329
Rym: Oh my god.

61
00:03:02,472 --> 00:03:02,938
Rym: Basically...

62
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:04,605
Scott: I've been basically practicing.

63
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,234
Scott: You know how most people, they're gonna do something.

64
00:03:07,255 --> 00:03:08,358
Scott: Like, they're gonna be in the Olympics.

65
00:03:08,398 --> 00:03:08,820
Scott: They train.

66
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:10,419
Rym: I play Carcassonne four times a day.

67
00:03:11,061 --> 00:03:12,930
Scott: I was playing Tini twice a day.

68
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,000
Scott: I'm playing Medici once or twice a day.

69
00:03:15,681 --> 00:03:19,540
Scott: I'm basically pumping board game iron to prepare for PAX.

70
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,610
Scott: And you notice I was winning at Bonanza, right?

71
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,400
Scott: I was doing, uh, I'm pretty much doing excellent all across the board.

72
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,660
Scott: So, at PAX, I am keeping hard score on everything.

73
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:31,795
Scott: I might even make a little app or something.

74
00:03:31,815 --> 00:03:32,420
Scott: That's bullshit.

75
00:03:32,562 --> 00:03:33,173
Rym: Will you?

76
00:03:33,193 --> 00:03:33,519
Rym: Will you?

77
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,860
Scott: I'm gonna use a notepad and keep track of all the scores.

78
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,328
Rym: Will you?

79
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:36,799
Rym: Will you?

80
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:37,387
Scott: I will.

81
00:03:37,712 --> 00:03:38,200
Scott: I will you.

82
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:43,780
Scott: I'll use a pencil and a paper and a camera to remember all the winnings and losings of PAX.

83
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,120
Rym: Should we do it like Magfest, where we tweeted each victory?

84
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,640
Scott: We're gonna do even harder core than Magfest.

85
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,118
Scott: And I'm gonna win.

86
00:03:49,503 --> 00:03:49,817
Rym: Are you?

87
00:03:50,341 --> 00:03:51,840
Scott: I've pumped the most board game iron.

88
00:03:52,622 --> 00:03:54,000
Rym: Uh, it's not just board games.

89
00:03:55,243 --> 00:03:55,739
Scott: That's true.

90
00:03:56,961 --> 00:03:57,619
Rym: Granted, actually.

91
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,000
Scott: But I've also been playing Punch-Out.

92
00:03:59,301 --> 00:04:03,860
Rym: The trouble is, PAX is the one gaming con where I basically do no video gaming.

93
00:04:04,803 --> 00:04:05,680
Scott: I do a tiny bit.

94
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:14,800
Rym: I'll walk into, like, the old, the retro table, or the retro, uh, like, uh, consoles and play, like, a game of Punch-Out or something, like, for five minutes, but...

95
00:04:14,941 --> 00:04:16,959
Scott: I wanna, I wanna see if they set up the Bomberman High Ten.

96
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,440
Rym: I mean, PAX, I love it, but the one thing it lacks is an actual arcade.

97
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,460
Rym: Magfest is where I go to play video fucking games.

98
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,560
Scott: It technically has one, but it's really small.

99
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,840
Rym: I know, like, I made that montage video to pump people up for PAX, and it shows that arcade makes it look really badass.

100
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,720
Rym: The secret is that in the Magfest video, I showed maybe a quarter of the arcade.

101
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:35,400
Rym: Yeah.

102
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:36,676
Rym: Because there was so much arcade.

103
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,880
Rym: That two-second shot from my PAX video is the entire PAX arcade.

104
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,360
Scott: You could fit one to, like, at least ten or twenty or thirty PAX arcades in the Magfest.

105
00:04:48,481 --> 00:04:50,039
Rym: Dude, the PAX arcade would fit in my apartment.

106
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:50,640
Rym: Yeah, it would.

107
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,720
Rym: In the Geeknight studio, you could fit a good chunk of the PAX arcade.

108
00:04:53,925 --> 00:04:54,436
Scott: Probably, yeah.

109
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,158
Rym: Why don't I do that?

110
00:04:56,901 --> 00:04:58,119
Scott: You're gonna have to remove all your stuff.

111
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,860
Rym: Yeah, and replace it with... Air hockey.

112
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,180
Rym: Oh my god, air hockey.

113
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:11,820
Rym: I would, if there were a time when somehow air hockey were the Omega-Thon finale, I might just have to rush the stage, naked, challenging everyone.

114
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,216
Rym: Do it.

115
00:05:12,683 --> 00:05:13,299
Rym: Oh my god.

116
00:05:13,582 --> 00:05:14,299
Scott: Oh, it's all you.

117
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,591
Scott: But imagine if we had an air hockey table, all that time we spend, like, laying around going, "Yep, yep,".

118
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:22,920
Scott: instead it'd be click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, until we were gods.

119
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:28,080
Rym: I think I would finally master the two-finger, which I'm worried about breaking my goddamn wrist when I try to play that way.

120
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:33,980
Scott: I would watch so many YouTube videos and study every single aspect and all the minor, you know, like, everything.

121
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:34,964
Rym: You know what we gotta find?

122
00:05:35,104 --> 00:05:38,500
Rym: Let's try to find a bar in the city that has, like, a real air hockey table.

123
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,778
Scott: Alright, New York City air hockey.

124
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,039
Scott: Photon air hockey.

125
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,700
Rym: None of that, uh, non-regulation shit.

126
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,478
Scott: Air hockey New York, let's see.

127
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,300
Scott: A point finally to the air hockey table.

128
00:05:49,561 --> 00:05:51,365
Rym: I mean, there's not one.

129
00:05:51,405 --> 00:05:56,900
Rym: There are multiple high-class bar lounges dedicated solely to table tennis.

130
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,363
Scott: Well, hold on.

131
00:05:57,383 --> 00:05:58,880
Scott: There's one for table tennis.

132
00:05:59,182 --> 00:06:00,140
Rym: No, there's more than one.

133
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,299
Scott: There really is more than just spin?

134
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,643
Rym: Yeah, there's more than spin.

135
00:06:02,804 --> 00:06:05,351
Rym: I'd go to spin because spin is the highest class one.

136
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:08,400
Rym: They have servants who will walk around handing you balls.

137
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,880
Scott: Alright, so there's Boulmore, which is bowling, right?

138
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,571
Rym: Boulmore's overrated.

139
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:13,199
Rym: There's better places.

140
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,580
Scott: I know, but I'm just saying, it's a relatively fancy bowling bar.

141
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,159
Scott: It's like spin.

142
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:18,602
Scott: Right.

143
00:06:18,784 --> 00:06:21,500
Scott: There's the place in Brooklyn, which is the skeeball place.

144
00:06:21,742 --> 00:06:22,299
Rym: Oh, yeah.

145
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,557
Scott: They have leagues, uh, this barcade, obviously, right?

146
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,084
Scott: But there is not an air hockey bar.

147
00:06:28,124 --> 00:06:34,940
Scott: If we had enough money to open a bar and get a liquor license, we could open up the air hockey bar and we'd probably make just as much money as the skeeball bar does.

148
00:06:35,201 --> 00:06:35,559
Rym: Easily.

149
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,319
Scott: Perhaps more.

150
00:06:38,145 --> 00:06:38,439
Rym: Oh, my gosh.

151
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:43,860
Scott: They just let people play free skeeball and they make all their money by selling alcohol and then they have leagues, which bring in a whole bunch of people.

152
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,024
Rym: You know what I'll do, Scott?

153
00:06:45,064 --> 00:06:49,600
Rym: I'm going to see if Magfest, because, I mean, we got Katsu-Kan to get us that goddamn Rampart machine.

154
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,280
Scott: Yeah, we got to pester Magfest.

155
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,419
Rym: I'll go to Magfest and be like, look, if you get a Rampart machine...

156
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:55,578
Scott: And an air hockey table.

157
00:06:56,223 --> 00:06:57,359
Rym: Or an air hockey table.

158
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:57,949
Scott: And/or...

159
00:06:58,681 --> 00:07:04,920
Rym: Either one of those, I will promise them that magic will happen around that table, meaning I will play it the entire time.

160
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,745
Scott: The thing is, it has to be a real table.

161
00:07:06,825 --> 00:07:08,349
Scott: It has to be balanced evenly.

162
00:07:08,369 --> 00:07:12,460
Scott: It has to work and it has to, you know, it can't be like damaged goods.

163
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,222
Rym: I'm worried, though.

164
00:07:13,242 --> 00:07:18,500
Rym: The reason I almost don't want a Rampart machine to appear is that I've maintained my undefeatedness.

165
00:07:19,322 --> 00:07:22,440
Rym: It's like the only area I have left where I am undefucking defeated.

166
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:32,840
Rym: If we actually have access to another Rampart machine, like that whole Katsu-Kan where we had it, I was so afraid I was going to lose, and one game I almost lost...

167
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,860
Scott: Well, you didn't, you sort of avoided any game you might have lost.

168
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:41,280
Rym: Well, no, the one game I almost lost, but Scott Johnson was pretty drunk and he basically threw the game in my favor by accident.

169
00:07:41,582 --> 00:07:43,458
Rym: But there was this really good guy who almost beat me.

170
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:50,413
Scott: But it's like, you know, if we played it, me and Scott Johnson would just walk up to it and be like, "Alright, listen, Rym's bragging about it being undefeated.

171
00:07:50,434 --> 00:07:51,095
Scott: Team up on Rym.

172
00:07:51,175 --> 00:07:51,476
Scott: Okay.

173
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:52,459
Scott: Do-do-do-do-do-do.

174
00:07:52,499 --> 00:07:52,579
Scott: We

175
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:52,719
Scott: win.".

176
00:07:53,281 --> 00:07:54,383
Rym: Uh, you see, you say that.

177
00:07:54,483 --> 00:08:00,779
Rym: But when we play games, usually what happens is you say that and everyone kind of looks at you and I'm like, "Scott's just saying that to try to win

178
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:01,180
Rym: himself.".

179
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,456
Scott: Well, you know that I would definitely not... I would definitely apple it up.

180
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:05,180
Scott: I would not orange.

181
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,759
Scott: And if Scott Johnson oranged, which he may well do...

182
00:08:08,042 --> 00:08:08,610
Rym: I'd give it a 50/50 shot.

183
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:10,185
Scott: I do also.

184
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:13,120
Scott: I would go and just get, like, Pete or someone who would not call orange.

185
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,700
Rym: You think Pete wouldn't orange on you?

186
00:08:15,501 --> 00:08:16,860
Rym: Pete would orange all over you.

187
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,100
Scott: There has to be someone who would not orange.

188
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,860
Rym: Pete would get his orange all over your business.

189
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:26,440
Scott: Who would go all out and attack only Rym until he was dead to make sure that he was no longer undefeated at Rampart?

190
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,085
Rym: It's one thing.

191
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:27,953
Rym: Like, last night, right?

192
00:08:27,993 --> 00:08:28,740
Rym: We had the board game night.

193
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,244
Scott: I'll just pay some stranger.

194
00:08:30,264 --> 00:08:31,467
Scott: I'll be like, "I'll give you five bucks.

195
00:08:31,908 --> 00:08:33,832
Scott: All you gotta do is only attack that guy.

196
00:08:33,893 --> 00:08:36,019
Scott: And then once he's dead, we'll play you and me fair and

197
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:36,380
Scott: square.".

198
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:37,453
Rym: I'll go to the guy and be like, "Ten

199
00:08:37,472 --> 00:08:37,736
Rym: bucks.".

200
00:08:38,063 --> 00:08:38,299
Scott: Twenty.

201
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:38,751
Scott: Thirty.

202
00:08:39,027 --> 00:08:39,320
Rym: Fifty.

203
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:39,679
Rym: Hundred.

204
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:40,678
Scott: Two hundred.

205
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,040
Rym: Scott, I have more money than you, and this is one area that means a lot to me.

206
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,964
Scott: Well, you know what?

207
00:08:46,145 --> 00:08:48,860
Scott: I would employ the secret technique, which I will not reveal.

208
00:08:49,643 --> 00:08:50,352
Rym: Punch me in the face.

209
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:51,020
Rym: Hack the machine.

210
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,664
Scott: Something along those lines.

211
00:08:52,684 --> 00:08:56,300
Scott: Like, put my hand over and spin your trackball around while you're trying to play some pieces.

212
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,420
Rym: Scott's fastest Ramparting strategy.

213
00:08:57,861 --> 00:09:00,340
Scott: Hit your buttons a whole bunch to play some pieces.

214
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:02,603
Rym: So, last night, right?

215
00:09:02,703 --> 00:09:11,679
Rym: You know, this is why... I'm always able to pull it off on you.

216
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,700
Scott: People are dicks.

217
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:17,720
Rym: Not enough people will listen to this episode from Tuesday to know that I said this, but look at last night, right?

218
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,120
Rym: Our friend Kat was playing the Cameltron with all our other friends, and they all learned the game.

219
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:25,180
Rym: And they're playing, you know, as derpily as first-time players can play.

220
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,647
Rym: But Kat had to go outside, so she couldn't finish the game.

221
00:09:28,687 --> 00:09:33,780
Rym: So I took over for her, and I sit down, and I look, and she's actually in a really good position.

222
00:09:34,682 --> 00:09:38,119
Rym: So I immediately sit down and say, "Oh, alright, I gotta figure out...".

223
00:09:38,301 --> 00:09:39,574
Rym: "Oh my god, what was Kat

224
00:09:39,594 --> 00:09:39,857
Rym: doing?".

225
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:41,427
Rym: "Oh my god, I can't win!

226
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:42,172
Rym: Look at this!

227
00:09:42,212 --> 00:09:42,976
Rym: That camel doesn't have

228
00:09:43,057 --> 00:09:43,359
Rym: anything!".

229
00:09:43,802 --> 00:09:46,160
Rym: And I bitched about it for, like, ten turns.

230
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:50,760
Rym: Meanwhile, I was winning by, like, thirty points.

231
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,940
Rym: And no one noticed because I was bitching so much.

232
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,947
Scott: Yeah, you know what happened to me?

233
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,420
Scott: We started playing Brass, right?

234
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,960
Scott: And I'd never played this game before, and I wasn't quite sure what the strategies were or anything.

235
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,751
Scott: So, you know, I make a move.

236
00:10:00,852 --> 00:10:01,760
Scott: I'm just sort of fooling around.

237
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,685
Scott: I'm like, "I'll build a coal mine,

238
00:10:02,705 --> 00:10:03,047
Scott: whatever.".

239
00:10:03,268 --> 00:10:04,574
Scott: I'm just, like, feeling it out.

240
00:10:04,856 --> 00:10:05,660
Scott: Just trying stuff.

241
00:10:05,702 --> 00:10:05,860
Scott: Whatevs.

242
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,307
Scott: And then I realize, "Oh, you should,".

243
00:10:09,387 --> 00:10:14,399
Scott: and I say it out loud, "You should sell cotton immediately to up your income, otherwise you're stuck at

244
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:14,780
Scott: zero.".

245
00:10:14,942 --> 00:10:15,777
Rym: I heard you say it.

246
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:22,840
Scott: Then Steve is like, "Oh," and he sells cotton immediately, thus making it harder for anyone else to do it.

247
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,111
Scott: He gets a big boost in income before anyone else, and I'm like,

248
00:10:25,915 --> 00:10:25,976
Scott: "Ugh.".

249
00:10:27,305 --> 00:10:28,559
Rym: I was the one who thought of that.

250
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,638
Rym: Because, Scott... And now I lose.

251
00:10:31,221 --> 00:10:38,580
Rym: The way to win the PAX who wins the most game games is to pull out games that no one's played before and just captain it up.

252
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,200
Rym: Craft captain, craft captain, craft captain.

253
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,998
Scott: The thing is, I don't feel bad doing that.

254
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,140
Rym: Bushels in the castle, biscuits in the baskets.

255
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,325
Scott: I want to win legitimately.

256
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:46,988
Scott: I want to play games.

257
00:10:47,109 --> 00:10:49,460
Scott: everyone knows how to play and out-power everyone.

258
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,979
Scott: Because that is much more satisfying.

259
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,280
Rym: All right, games everyone knows how to play.

260
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,650
Rym: Teeny, we're deadlocked.

261
00:10:53,731 --> 00:10:54,780
Rym: Puerto Rico, we're deadlocked.

262
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,699
Scott: Like, if I win a Bonanza, that's a big fucking deal.

263
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,540
Rym: Oh, Bonanza, Ro is going to kick the shit out of both of us.

264
00:10:59,984 --> 00:11:01,700
Scott: I'm just saying, that's the point.

265
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,237
Scott: It's like a game everyone's good at.

266
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,671
Scott: If you win a Dominion, it's like,

267
00:11:05,812 --> 00:11:06,556
Scott: "Boom!".

268
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:07,943
Scott: Yes!

269
00:11:09,401 --> 00:11:11,215
Rym: If she wins a Dominion, it's like, "Saw that

270
00:11:11,235 --> 00:11:11,517
Rym: coming.".

271
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,740
Scott: That's a different story.

272
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,441
Scott: Right?

273
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:18,637
Scott: It's like, you got to win at a game that people know, and then it's like, "Yeah, that

274
00:11:18,697 --> 00:11:19,099
Scott: counts.".

275
00:11:19,623 --> 00:11:19,909
Scott: What?

276
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:20,011
Scott: What?

277
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:25,993
Scott: Otherwise, it's like, if you're Michael Jordan walking out playing against the high school kids, it doesn't mean anything.

278
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:32,555
Scott: For it to be a real championship, it's got to be the best of the best.

279
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:33,660
Scott: playing for serious.

280
00:11:34,941 --> 00:11:36,530
Rym: So, a little bit of news.

281
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,340
Rym: It's Thursday, it's The Lounge.

282
00:11:38,921 --> 00:11:39,480
Scott: You and your lounge.

283
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,480
Rym: Talk about whatever we want.

284
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,410
Scott: You know what's in my lounge?

285
00:11:41,511 --> 00:11:42,079
Scott: Air hockey table.

286
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,700
Rym: There's a pretty good article in The Atlantic, actually, and I want to call attention to it.

287
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:54,520
Rym: I won't talk about it a lot, but it argues that The Daily Show, of all shows, people always say The Daily Show provides more news to people than it should.

288
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,199
Rym: People watch it to get the news, even though it's a comedy show.

289
00:11:59,463 --> 00:12:08,483
Rym: It is interesting how vaguely obsessed Fox News is with The Daily Show, when The Daily Show is ostensibly comedy and Fox News is ostensibly news, but I digress.

290
00:12:08,523 --> 00:12:10,972
Rym: This isn't new news for any of you.

291
00:12:10,992 --> 00:12:12,196
Rym: It's old news.

292
00:12:12,216 --> 00:12:13,280
Rym: We're talking about news.

293
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,218
Scott: Century old news.

294
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,810
Rym: So, this article takes it from a different light.

295
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,740
Rym: It talks about the whole UNESCO fiasco.

296
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,880
Rym: Are you familiar with this, Scott?

297
00:12:20,063 --> 00:12:20,439
Scott: Not really.

298
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,608
Rym: Okay, so here's the deal.

299
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:23,000
Rym: This is old news.

300
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:24,580
Scott: I might know it once you start talking about it.

301
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,880
Rym: I followed it because I was really pissed off about it, but the media basically didn't care.

302
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:36,200
Rym: UNESCO is the UN organization that basically tries to provide clean water to people in starving countries.

303
00:12:36,961 --> 00:12:38,760
Scott: They didn't seem to be doing a very good job in India.

304
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,879
Rym: They focus on the places that are worse off than India.

305
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,860
Scott: Okay, where they can't even get the bottled water.

306
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,046
Rym: They also work in India.

307
00:12:47,608 --> 00:12:51,300
Rym: It's an organization to where no one can say anything bad about them.

308
00:12:51,842 --> 00:12:53,580
Rym: They are nothing but a force for good.

309
00:12:53,661 --> 00:12:55,500
Scott: All they do is give water to people who have no water.

310
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,579
Rym: So, the members of UNESCO voted to allow Palestine in.

311
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,724
Scott: Of course.

312
00:13:00,744 --> 00:13:02,440
Scott: Do they need water?

313
00:13:03,402 --> 00:13:04,340
Scott: Are they people?

314
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,659
Rym: No, they provide aid to people who aren't even in.

315
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,419
Rym: If you're in, it means you're helping with humanitarian efforts.

316
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,275
Rym: You have a vote in UNESCO to where the money goes.

317
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:12,939
Rym: Stuff like that.

318
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:13,920
Rym: Oh, okay.

319
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:22,580
Rym: So, they wanted to bring Palestine in, and there was a huge majority of votes in UNESCO to allow Palestine to join this purely humanitarian organization.

320
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:31,640
Scott: If they want to give money to help people, including themselves and others, and then have a small one vote in deciding who gets help, what's wrong with that?

321
00:13:32,121 --> 00:13:36,100
Rym: So, I believe 12 or 13 members of UNESCO voted against this.

322
00:13:36,323 --> 00:13:36,840
Scott: All the Jews?

323
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,580
Rym: Pretty much Israel, the US, and all the Israel allied countries.

324
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,378
Scott: Right, okay.

325
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,640
Rym: So, the US pulled all funding from UNESCO.

326
00:13:48,323 --> 00:13:48,958
Scott: What the fuck?

327
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:49,953
Rym: $70 million gone.

328
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,999
Scott: Obama was just okay with that?

329
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:53,779
Rym: Obama's actually really pissed about it.

330
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,297
Scott: Oh, okay.

331
00:13:54,681 --> 00:13:55,674
Rym: But he can't do anything.

332
00:13:55,714 --> 00:13:56,160
Rym: It's Congress.

333
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:07,355
Rym: So, Congress passed a law a long time ago, '90s, saying any UN organization that recognizes Palestine as a state, we will not talk to them.

334
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:08,200
Rym: We will not help them.

335
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,550
Rym: We will deny all funding.

336
00:14:09,671 --> 00:14:10,559
Rym: We'll basically fuck them.

337
00:14:12,121 --> 00:14:15,660
Scott: Dude, the thing is, if you think about it, it's like a board game.

338
00:14:16,801 --> 00:14:21,345
Scott: What they should do, all these people in the UN should just be like, "Hey, let's fuck the US.

339
00:14:21,365 --> 00:14:24,457
Scott: Let's put Palestine in every organization forcing the US out of

340
00:14:24,518 --> 00:14:24,959
Scott: everything.".

341
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:32,180
Rym: Scott, the Republicans and a lot of people in the US would love that, because basically all it means is the US stops funding humanitarian programs around the world.

342
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,000
Scott: Well, no, they could do it in all of the other things that the US wants to be on.

343
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,720
Scott: Like, the UN could vote Palestine onto the Security Council, which would be crazy.

344
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,951
Scott: And then he's like, "Oh, US can't be on the Security Council

345
00:14:40,971 --> 00:14:41,192
Scott: anymore.".

346
00:14:42,605 --> 00:14:43,320
Scott: China makes all decisions.

347
00:14:43,381 --> 00:14:44,840
Rym: It's a little more complicated than that, but anyway.

348
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,600
Scott: I'm just saying, crazy shit.

349
00:14:46,941 --> 00:14:55,940
Rym: So, the law is there, ostensibly, to force Israel and Palestine to negotiate directly and to not let anyone else influence that in any way.

350
00:14:56,221 --> 00:14:56,518
Scott: Of course.

351
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:02,060
Rym: Now, the reasoning behind that, and this whole situation, is basically absurd.

352
00:15:02,624 --> 00:15:02,876
Scott: Duh.

353
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:11,900
Rym: And this article talks about how all the news coverage of it basically toed, not the party line, but the kind of status quo line.

354
00:15:12,181 --> 00:15:16,400
Rym: The news all said, "Yep, well, they reported very matter of fact.

355
00:15:17,561 --> 00:15:19,459
Rym: This organization voted to let Palestine in.

356
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,829
Rym: The US has a law that says that they can't fund it, so the US had to stop funding it at the

357
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,010
Rym: end.".

358
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:29,059
Rym: So, The Daily Show did a double feature on how bullshit this is.

359
00:15:29,423 --> 00:15:29,820
Scott: Of course.

360
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,320
Scott: It's like, this is one of those things where it's like, "Oh, there's a rule that the US can't do

361
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:34,380
Scott: it.".

362
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,300
Scott: It's like, a rule is just something that's made up by people.

363
00:15:37,842 --> 00:15:39,320
Scott: You can just fucking change that shit.

364
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:41,600
Rym: It's a rule made up by Congress that they can trivially change.

365
00:15:41,664 --> 00:15:41,940
Scott: Right.

366
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,080
Scott: You can just change that shit.

367
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,560
Scott: It's not like the law of thermodynamics.

368
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:46,416
Scott: You can't change.

369
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:51,879
Rym: John Oliver on The Daily Show interviewed a senator and was like, "So, we can't do anything about

370
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:52,040
Rym: this.".

371
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,220
Rym: The guy's like, "Yeah, our hands are tied.

372
00:15:53,321 --> 00:15:53,855
Rym: We can't fund

373
00:15:53,896 --> 00:15:53,999
Rym: them.".

374
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,656
Rym: And he was like, "Because of the law you

375
00:15:55,697 --> 00:15:56,020
Rym: passed.".

376
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:56,452
Rym: He's like, "That's

377
00:15:56,535 --> 00:15:56,720
Rym: right.".

378
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,140
Rym: He's like, "So, Congress doesn't have the power to change laws.

379
00:15:59,221 --> 00:15:59,607
Rym: That's good to

380
00:15:59,628 --> 00:15:59,770
Rym: know.".

381
00:16:01,243 --> 00:16:02,172
Rym: And the guy's like, "Well...".

382
00:16:03,184 --> 00:16:03,939
Rym: Basically, he punked him.

383
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:04,393
Scott: Yes.

384
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:43,416
Rym: So, this article, you know, not to get into the UNESCO thing, even though it's absurd, but the article points out that The Daily Show scarily is actually the only major news show in the world, or at least in America, even though it's not a news show, that when it covers the news, does not cover it from the status quo perspective, but covers it from actually a more objective standpoint than actual news does, because actual news and trying to be objective doesn't actually talk about the ramifications of anything and really just focuses on the facts and assumes a lot of these things that are status quo, when really the news story isn't that the U.S.

385
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:44,180
Rym: had to follow this law.

386
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,480
Rym: The news story is that this is a fucked up situation that's hurting people.

387
00:16:47,891 --> 00:16:48,080
Scott: Dope.

388
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:50,340
Rym: And it's actually a really great article.

389
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,400
Scott: But that's why The Daily Show's comedy, right?

390
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,780
Scott: Comedy is truth.

391
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,180
Scott: Have you read friggin' Stranger in a Strange Land or not?

392
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,660
Rym: Or perhaps the court jester is the only one who can call the king fat.

393
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,800
Rym: No kidding, right?

394
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,440
Rym: Except we live in a place where there's free speech.

395
00:17:04,681 --> 00:17:08,160
Rym: The news could call the king fat and the king can't do shit about it.

396
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,119
Rym: The news just doesn't.

397
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:14,680
Scott: Why don't we just start a news where we say that we have the same smart perspective, but we don't present it as comedy?

398
00:17:15,162 --> 00:17:17,440
Scott: And we just put it on YouTube every day and we'll do one news story.

399
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:21,079
Rym: Let's put that in the hopper with the other thousand things in the hopper.

400
00:17:21,621 --> 00:17:23,215
Scott: Why isn't someone listening to the show?

401
00:17:23,236 --> 00:17:23,660
Scott: just do it?

402
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,618
Scott: We don't care how shitty it is.

403
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,520
Scott: It could be like elementary school CCTV news quality.

404
00:17:28,785 --> 00:17:29,300
Rym: It doesn't matter.

405
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,084
Rym: We have Project

406
00:17:30,165 --> 00:17:30,549
Rym: S.T.,

407
00:17:30,831 --> 00:17:31,477
Rym: Project C.R.L.

408
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,120
Rym: They're all Project S.T We have Project T.T.I.

409
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:43,080
Scott: But anyone out there who's got a camera, just sit in front of it every day, pick a news story, and just be like, "Today, UNESCO, whatever, funding cut.

410
00:17:43,401 --> 00:17:46,819
Scott: Because of this rule, the government is stupid and they could just change it, but they refuse

411
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:46,940
Scott: to.".

412
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:53,280
Scott: In other words, all your congressmen are basically taking clean water out of the mouths of starving people.

413
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,709
Scott: They're disgusting.

414
00:17:55,134 --> 00:17:55,660
Scott: End of story.

415
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,040
Rym: So, this is an interesting article.

416
00:17:58,342 --> 00:17:59,599
Rym: I highly recommend you read it.

417
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:00,275
Scott: Great.

418
00:18:01,904 --> 00:18:02,680
Rym: So, you have anything?

419
00:18:03,662 --> 00:18:04,067
Scott: Oh, I did.

420
00:18:04,087 --> 00:18:05,260
Scott: I remember my news now.

421
00:18:05,602 --> 00:18:08,060
Scott: I didn't have a link open for it, so I couldn't remember what it was.

422
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,023
Scott: So, check this out.

423
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:11,700
Scott: There's this crazy dude, and he went to a casino.

424
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,298
Scott: Now, usually, going to a casino is not a good idea, right?

425
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,000
Scott: It's a way to lose all the money.

426
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,375
Scott: Because casinos, the house always wins.

427
00:18:18,738 --> 00:18:18,960
Scott: Always.

428
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,420
Scott: And, you know, there was card counting at one point, but today, card counting doesn't work.

429
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:23,763
Scott: Right?

430
00:18:23,783 --> 00:18:24,113
Scott: Forget it.

431
00:18:24,941 --> 00:18:27,420
Scott: But this guy, he was, you know, a big time gambler.

432
00:18:27,962 --> 00:18:33,820
Scott: And apparently, I wasn't totally aware of this, but if you're a big time gambler, you don't just walk into a casino and play.

433
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,380
Scott: You talk to the casino, and because you have so much money, they talk to you.

434
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,858
Scott: So, like, if you and me walk into a casino, you know, you walk over to the craps table and it says, like,

435
00:18:42,878 --> 00:18:42,898
Scott: "5x.".

436
00:18:44,262 --> 00:18:45,048
Scott: You can't change that.

437
00:18:45,068 --> 00:18:46,400
Scott: That's just the rule for the game.

438
00:18:46,601 --> 00:18:48,399
Scott: And if you don't like the rule, you don't play there.

439
00:18:49,341 --> 00:18:53,298
Scott: If you're mad rich, you can walk in and be like, "Hey, can you set me up a craps table with these

440
00:18:53,379 --> 00:18:53,680
Scott: rules?".

441
00:18:53,781 --> 00:18:57,620
Scott: And they'll be like, "Well, actually, we don't like those rules because then the house doesn't always win.

442
00:18:57,982 --> 00:18:58,533
Scott: How about these

443
00:18:58,574 --> 00:18:58,840
Scott: rules?".

444
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,940
Scott: And you can negotiate on the rules and, like, how much money you're going to spend and all this stuff.

445
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,480
Scott: So this guy went in, and he negotiated with these casinos.

446
00:19:06,682 --> 00:19:08,660
Scott: And, by the way, the casinos are the desperate.

447
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,920
Scott: Like, actually, Foxwoods is even in big trouble.

448
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:17,700
Scott: Because, you know, there's basically more casinos, the love's getting spread around, there's online poker and stuff, right?

449
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,900
Scott: So, casinos are not doing well lately.

450
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,420
Scott: So they're basically more desperate than ever to get people to come in, especially the high rollers.

451
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:29,200
Scott: Because, you know, a whole bunch of low rollers, you know, a bus full of people coming from the city isn't going to help.

452
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,020
Rym: Well, it's old ladies nickel at a time.

453
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:31,942
Scott: Right.

454
00:19:32,002 --> 00:19:38,420
Scott: And if you want, you know, but one high roller, if he comes in and loses all his monies, your casino's good for, like, a whole month or two.

455
00:19:38,521 --> 00:19:39,576
Scott: So it's like, "Yeah, we need

456
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:39,738
Scott: that.".

457
00:19:40,123 --> 00:19:41,680
Scott: So they're desperate to get this guy in the door.

458
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,280
Scott: So, you know, the guy's figuring out which casino he wants to go to.

459
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:49,440
Scott: So they're sort of competing as who's going to set him more favorable rules to get him in the door.

460
00:19:49,903 --> 00:19:52,200
Scott: They also actually are not technologically stupid.

461
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,820
Scott: They actually have this computerized system that works and is good, where they can type in the rules.

462
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:06,439
Scott: Like, "Guy wants to play blackjack with six decks and wants to allow double splitting and wants to allow this and that rules for this minimum bet on this and

463
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:06,620
Scott: this.".

464
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,655
Scott: And then it'll pretty much tell the casino owner, you know, once he types in those rules, "Thumbs up!

465
00:20:11,876 --> 00:20:12,056
Scott: We'll

466
00:20:12,096 --> 00:20:12,377
Scott: win!"

467
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:12,899
Scott: or "Thumbs

468
00:20:12,939 --> 00:20:13,180
Scott: down!"

469
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,436
Scott: "No, this is a bad idea if we let him play this

470
00:20:15,477 --> 00:20:15,739
Scott: game."

471
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:15,920
Scott: Right?

472
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:22,040
Scott: So apparently, whoever was at this casino totally fucked up and didn't use the software properly or who knows what.

473
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:28,600
Scott: And they basically let this guy play at what was almost, like, 50/50 odds on blackjack.

474
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,148
Scott: So he walked in with, like, "He's mad

475
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:31,469
Scott: rich.".

476
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:33,517
Scott: So he was just like, "Million

477
00:20:33,557 --> 00:20:33,979
Scott: dollars."

478
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,820
Scott: And he got mad lucky and he got, like, four eights and he split it four ways.

479
00:20:38,581 --> 00:20:47,760
Scott: And there was also some weird rule about, like, you know, usually in blackjack it's, like, the house, like, has to hit in a certain situation and has to stop in a certain situation.

480
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:50,109
Scott: And it's usually the same rules all the time.

481
00:20:50,571 --> 00:20:52,460
Scott: Those rules were even different in this game.

482
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:59,479
Scott: So it was basically a situation where, like, he had four hands and the house went over and it was like, "Oh, one hand with millions of

483
00:20:59,499 --> 00:20:59,880
Scott: dollars.".

484
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,189
Scott: "Ha ha ha ha

485
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:01,352
Scott: ha.".

486
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,919
Scott: And this guy just-- It's a pretty good story.

487
00:21:04,461 --> 00:21:07,468
Scott: The dude friggin' rolled the casino without cheating.

488
00:21:08,089 --> 00:21:08,430
Scott: Right?

489
00:21:08,631 --> 00:21:09,292
Scott: Without cheating.

490
00:21:09,312 --> 00:21:10,535
Scott: He didn't count the cards.

491
00:21:10,575 --> 00:21:12,820
Scott: He just played blackjack smartly and normally.

492
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,360
Scott: And had the rules of the game changed, but the casino agreed to it.

493
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,308
Scott: So, uh, this is just another one.

494
00:21:19,368 --> 00:21:23,160
Scott: I wanted to bring this up, though, because it's not, you know, it's an example of smart nerdiness.

495
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,014
Scott: A guy knowing the rules, doing the math, using his smart brain to get ahead.

496
00:21:27,255 --> 00:21:27,456
Scott: Right?

497
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:28,580
Scott: Which is laudable.

498
00:21:29,141 --> 00:21:36,759
Scott: But it's also another example of, if you want to get more rich, and you already are rich, it's real easy.

499
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:37,200
Scott: Right?

500
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:42,714
Scott: But if you're poor, you can't get more rich as easily as someone who's already rich.

501
00:21:44,378 --> 00:21:44,980
Scott: Even at the casino.

502
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:52,680
Rym: But anyway, things of the day!

503
00:21:52,781 --> 00:21:55,410
Rym: So, I was born in 1982.

504
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:55,605
Rym: Me too.

505
00:21:55,891 --> 00:21:58,271
Rym: And this video is from 1982.

506
00:21:58,271 --> 00:21:58,590
Scott: Me too.

507
00:21:58,831 --> 00:22:03,570
Rym: It is a video, volume one, of how to beat home video games.

508
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,867
Scott: I wonder how much that shit cost on VHS, like 30 bucks per-.

509
00:22:06,271 --> 00:22:13,550
Scott: I have no idea, but this is- And it probably cost like 30 bucks for one VHS tape, and it probably was like 50 dollars for the Atari games.

510
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:20,589
Scott: This is how to beat- You're paying 30 bucks to learn how to beat- How to beat Atari Circus, and there's something about- The one with the seesaw?

511
00:22:20,996 --> 00:22:21,186
Scott: Yes.

512
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,476
Scott: Yeah, I know how to beat it.

513
00:22:22,818 --> 00:22:24,710
Scott: Always make sure the seesaw's under the falling dude.

514
00:22:25,251 --> 00:22:32,730
Rym: He has some good strategies here, but the thing is, it's interesting to watch because it's a blast from the past, and it reminds me that I didn't own Circus Atari.

515
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,530
Scott: But I had this catalog- I borrowed it for a short time.

516
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:42,970
Rym: When I was a kid, that listed like every Atari game you could buy and like a review of it, and I was obsessed with all the games I didn't have.

517
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:43,548
Scott: Of course.

518
00:22:44,951 --> 00:22:46,590
Rym: Circus Atari's actually not that good of a game.

519
00:22:47,151 --> 00:22:48,250
Scott: It's not the worst though.

520
00:22:48,611 --> 00:22:49,230
Rym: It's not the best.

521
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:54,930
Scott: There are a lot worse Atari games, but it is not exactly one of the Atari greats like Pitfall and such.

522
00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:03,770
Rym: Yeah, but these strategies- These videos are pretty interesting to watch, and they really take you back to, you know, the early '80s were more like the late '70s than you might realize.

523
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:10,330
Scott: I have a VHS tape because when the TurboGrafx-16 was coming out, they had a big promotional thing at the mall, at the shopping mall next to us.

524
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:14,089
Scott: And I went over there and played a bunch of demo stations before like you could even buy one.

525
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:14,453
Rym: Ah.

526
00:23:15,151 --> 00:23:21,330
Scott: And I got a VHS tape that is basically an advertisement for TurboGrafx-16, and I must have watched it like two or three times.

527
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,700
Rym: I have the VHS tape.

528
00:23:22,741 --> 00:23:23,630
Rym: It's not that old.

529
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:27,970
Scott: I should dig it up and try to get it onto YouTube if it's not on there already.

530
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:32,770
Rym: Dragon Strike, that D&D-ish game that was released with the VHS tape that came with it.

531
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,409
Scott: Never played it, but I knew about it.

532
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:35,257
Rym: Yeah, I had it.

533
00:23:35,277 --> 00:23:35,907
Rym: I had the VHS tape.

534
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:36,337
Rym: Whoa.

535
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,069
Rym: Never played it though because no one would play it with me.

536
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,514
Scott: I was a bigger fan of the one.

537
00:23:39,554 --> 00:23:45,730
Scott: I can't seem to find it anywhere, but it came- remember the second- No.

538
00:23:46,252 --> 00:23:46,870
Rym: Or Haunted Mansion.

539
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:47,074
Scott: No.

540
00:23:47,372 --> 00:23:47,438
Scott: No?

541
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:53,807
Scott: I'm talking about this D&D game where it was basically- you had no GM because there was a big box full of cards.

542
00:23:53,847 --> 00:23:55,010
Scott: that was the GM, right?

543
00:23:55,370 --> 00:24:02,790
Scott: And like the box was basically- remember when they reprinted the second edition stuff, it was in a different graphical style where it was black, right?

544
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,482
Scott: With the, you know, the picture in the middle?

545
00:24:04,502 --> 00:24:05,490
Scott: You know what I'm talking about?

546
00:24:06,213 --> 00:24:06,789
Rym: Uh, yeah.

547
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:10,309
Scott: And basically this box was in that style and had a big red dragon on it.

548
00:24:10,651 --> 00:24:18,010
Scott: And basically you had a fold-out dungeon and you would move your guys around the dungeon sort of like HeroQuest, but it was TSR D&D brand.

549
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:27,830
Scott: And it had a, you know, there was this big box full of cards and basically you would move around and then instead of, you know, being a GM or anything, you just went to the box and it told you what was in the dungeon and stuff.

550
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:28,856
Rym: Oh, so I found your video.

551
00:24:29,379 --> 00:24:31,410
Rym: There were multiple versions of this apparently.

552
00:24:32,593 --> 00:24:33,169
Scott: That's the one.

553
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:33,814
Rym: I got it.

554
00:24:33,874 --> 00:24:34,459
Rym: I'll link to it.

555
00:24:35,124 --> 00:24:35,950
Rym: Bonus thing of the day.

556
00:24:36,574 --> 00:24:36,765
Scott: Alright.

557
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:38,981
Scott: So anyway, my actual thing of the day- Yup.

558
00:24:39,451 --> 00:24:46,490
Scott: Is, uh, everyone's probably seen this already because it was all over the internets and I'm pretty sure there's a whole, probably a whole bunch of things like this, so it's not unique at all.

559
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,037
Scott: Um, and it's, you know, but whatever.

560
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,504
Scott: It's got four million views.

561
00:24:50,524 --> 00:24:51,710
Scott: It could use a few more views.

562
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,510
Scott: It's something called the Wrecking Crew Orchestra.

563
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,938
Scott: And this is actually pretty recent from February 8th, 2012.

564
00:24:55,938 --> 00:24:58,750
Scott: So even if these guys have been around a while, this is a recent performance.

565
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:06,830
Scott: What they do is they're basically a dance troupe, but they perform in the dark and they wear suits covered with lights and, you know, like strip lights and LED lights.

566
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,370
Rym: Now, think about the ramifications of what you can do with that.

567
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:14,410
Scott: And yeah, and the lights are basically pre-programmed or controlled by someone from a central location or something.

568
00:25:14,851 --> 00:25:21,090
Scott: So they dance and they appear and disappear and shift and they do all sorts of cool, you know, performance tricks going on here.

569
00:25:22,111 --> 00:25:23,434
Scott: Uh, and it is fun to watch.

570
00:25:23,474 --> 00:25:29,710
Scott: I mean, it wouldn't probably be fun to watch, like, you know, a whole bunch of these, but watching one if you haven't seen one is really awesome.

571
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,680
Scott: And if you've seen it already, alright.

572
00:25:33,001 --> 00:25:34,970
Scott: If you haven't seen it already, must see.

573
00:25:36,851 --> 00:25:40,543
Rym: So in the meta moment, uh, two weeks to PAX.

574
00:25:41,346 --> 00:25:42,690
Rym: It's a-coming.

575
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:48,610
Rym: We're doing a whole bunch of panels and a bunch of our friends are doing a whole bunch of panels and workshops.

576
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,289
Scott: Playing a whole bunch of games.

577
00:25:50,651 --> 00:25:52,490
Rym: We're gonna be at PAX in force.

578
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:57,483
Scott: Pretty much, I gotta apologize, PAX Fever is in full effect as it is twice a year.

579
00:25:57,984 --> 00:26:00,050
Scott: Maybe it'll become three times a year, we have no idea.

580
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:00,852
Rym: Well, there's a cure.

581
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:05,963
Rym: If you are so hyped about PAX that you can't get over it, I'll link to a video.

582
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:08,850
Rym: I made a montage of how awesome PAX was last year.

583
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,921
Rym: And if you watch it, it might excite you so much.

584
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:13,970
Rym: you'll die and then you won't have to worry about it anymore.

585
00:26:15,418 --> 00:26:16,530
Scott: Yeah, it's not gonna help.

586
00:26:17,611 --> 00:26:20,220
Rym: That's like, hmm, cure for AIDS?

587
00:26:21,223 --> 00:26:23,350
Scott: Unprotected sex with someone with AIDS?

588
00:26:23,551 --> 00:26:25,029
Rym: Last night during the board game night.

589
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:25,586
Scott: Cure for flu?

590
00:26:26,032 --> 00:26:29,070
Rym: We were talking about ponies and I was like, oh, there was a bunch of ponies at PAX.

591
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,990
Scott: Going outside in the cold naked, that's a cure for flu.

592
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:32,531
Rym: They were like, what?

593
00:26:32,551 --> 00:26:37,164
Rym: And I'm like, yeah, so I pull up that montage video and I skip to where all the pony stuff was and then I'm like, oh shit, PAX.

594
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:39,090
Rym: Oh shit, PAX.

595
00:26:39,911 --> 00:26:44,290
Rym: Uh, you wanna make predictions now as to what the Omegathon's gonna be or save it for Tuesday?

596
00:26:45,512 --> 00:26:50,610
Scott: I told you, I'm sticking with, cause they already said- It's East, so it's gonna be teams, most likely.

597
00:26:50,691 --> 00:26:52,310
Scott: It's East, so it's co-op, guaranteed.

598
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:55,550
Scott: And, you know, they had to have something built for this.

599
00:26:55,773 --> 00:26:56,790
Rym: I'm going with Double Dare.

600
00:26:58,193 --> 00:26:58,970
Scott: It can't be Double Dare.

601
00:26:59,130 --> 00:26:59,473
Scott: Why not?

602
00:26:59,513 --> 00:27:01,509
Rym: It could be the Double Dare challenge at the end.

603
00:27:02,392 --> 00:27:10,830
Scott: I am thinking- No, I'm still going with my Rock 'Em Sock 'Em robot until, you know, it is no more.

604
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:12,890
Rym: Scott, you know what would be the ultimate, I realize.

605
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:16,850
Rym: As much as I want, you know, the Double Dare, the Aggro Craig- Crossfire.

606
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:17,450
Rym: Crossfire.

607
00:27:17,952 --> 00:27:18,310
Rym: Crossfire.

608
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:19,626
Rym: Crossfire.

609
00:27:20,378 --> 00:27:21,409
Scott: But that's not co-op either.

610
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,950
Scott: But they could easily make any of these things co-op.

611
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:28,790
Rym: Would be, if it was straight up American Gladiator.

612
00:27:30,731 --> 00:27:32,410
Scott: They did make an Aggro Craig, it's Guts.

613
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,848
Scott: They have all, full Guts, built into the thing.

614
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:38,750
Rym: The thing is, depending on the nerds who get to the finale- How can they possibly keep it secret?

615
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:39,729
Rym: It might be Guts.

616
00:27:41,691 --> 00:27:46,050
Rym: And the book is The Hunger Games, because it seems to be spreading faster than Twilight on Cancer.

617
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:48,300
Rym: And it's pretty good actually.

618
00:27:48,521 --> 00:27:49,546
Rym: Not great, but pretty good.

619
00:27:49,727 --> 00:27:50,089
Rym: I liked it.

620
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,370
Rym: So we'll do a show on it whenever.

621
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,650
Scott: Yet, I haven't read it yet, but I have a copy.

622
00:27:55,210 --> 00:28:02,690
Scott: But people say that it's basically Battle Royale, the ripoff, plus some Arnold Schwarzenegger running man mix in there.

623
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:03,850
Rym: And some 1984.

624
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:07,249
Scott: Yeah, so that's what people say about it, so maybe that sounds good to you.

625
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,868
Scott: I don't know, but that's what people say.

626
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,990
Rym: It exceeded expectations by a surprising amount.

627
00:28:13,412 --> 00:28:18,150
Scott: It'll probably actually be a "soon" book club, because once I actually start reading it, it shouldn't take very long at all.

628
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:19,810
Rym: Dude, it's like a two and a half hour read.

629
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,320
Scott: Right, so as soon as I actually get around to it, it'll be like

630
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:22,641
Scott: "bam!"

631
00:28:22,661 --> 00:28:24,790
Scott: and we'll do this book club right away and get a new one going.

632
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:27,550
Scott: It'll be much less weight than the previous book club, which took a while.

633
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:28,776
Rym: ConnectiCon is coming up.

634
00:28:28,937 --> 00:28:30,850
Rym: We run the panels and workshops department.

635
00:28:31,931 --> 00:28:35,530
Rym: If you submit a panel, I will link to the farm, and you're a GeekNights listener.

636
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:40,310
Rym: There's a good chance you'll get one, because you guys give us some of the best panels we get, normally.

637
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,167
Rym: Nepotism!

638
00:28:44,113 --> 00:28:44,810
Rym: But yeah, submit your panels.

639
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,310
Scott: It's not nepotism, they're not in our family.

640
00:28:47,632 --> 00:28:48,841
Rym: They're an extended family.

641
00:28:48,921 --> 00:28:50,090
Rym: The GeekNights family.

642
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:50,550
Scott: Sure.

643
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:51,818
Rym: Yeah.

644
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:59,448
Rym: We got an internet, we got a YouTube channel, got a website, got a forum, all that stuff.

645
00:28:59,589 --> 00:29:00,030
Rym: It's all there.

646
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:06,050
Rym: So it might be kind of a cop-out, but I figured I'd just talk about my experiences in India, because I'd never been to India before.

647
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:10,703
Scott: Alright, do you want to get any sort of prejudice, racist, out of our system now?

648
00:29:10,783 --> 00:29:12,608
Scott: Like, "Oh, a dalsib and great

649
00:29:12,648 --> 00:29:12,969
Scott: tiger.".

650
00:29:13,371 --> 00:29:15,297
Scott: Oh, so basically, when I was there- Hello, I am a poo.

651
00:29:15,561 --> 00:29:16,210
Scott: Thank you, come again.

652
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,390
Rym: Everybody breathes fire.

653
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,489
Rym: I'm sorry, everyone from India.

654
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:21,730
Rym: In fact, if you got food from a street vendor, he breathed fire on it before he gave it to you.

655
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,395
Scott: I'm sorry, everyone from India.

656
00:29:23,536 --> 00:29:27,450
Scott: I'm sure that when you can do a show about your trip to America, make fun of us, please, because I want to hear that.

657
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:35,349
Rym: Actually, the best joke someone made, and it was actually an Indian guy that I was hanging out with while I was there, was like, "Where are all the Native

658
00:29:35,389 --> 00:29:35,890
Rym: Americans?".

659
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,034
Rym: Yeah, I heard there are many of them here.

660
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,262
Rym: He was a funny guy.

661
00:29:40,286 --> 00:29:41,330
Rym: He was one of my cab drivers.

662
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:43,289
Scott: He tried to do too much with it.

663
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:51,868
Rym: He was the same one who was really proud of the slum, kind of how in America, if you're showing something around New York, you'll be like, "Yeah, that's a New York bum.

664
00:29:52,229 --> 00:29:52,469
Rym: Check him

665
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:52,590
Rym: out.".

666
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,363
Rym: Or, "See how there's no one in that subway car?

667
00:29:54,484 --> 00:29:54,867
Rym: Yeah.".

668
00:29:55,373 --> 00:29:56,150
Rym: It smells like pee.

669
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,357
Rym: This guy was like, "That's our slum.

670
00:29:57,377 --> 00:29:58,787
Rym: There's at least two million people in

671
00:29:58,827 --> 00:29:58,968
Rym: there.".

672
00:29:59,853 --> 00:29:59,939
Scott: Yeah.

673
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:00,731
Rym: "It's pretty

674
00:30:00,772 --> 00:30:00,993
Rym: big.".

675
00:30:01,535 --> 00:30:02,239
Rym: And he's like, "You want to take a

676
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:02,480
Rym: picture?".

677
00:30:02,721 --> 00:30:03,746
Rym: He was really just like, "Check it

678
00:30:03,807 --> 00:30:03,887
Rym: out.".

679
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:22,910
Rym: But anyway, I was there on business, so I actually didn't get to do ... I had evenings and a couple of times to myself where I could wander around, but I was actually mostly beholden to a whole bunch of corporate-style meetings, and I had to go to this conference there, like a convention, and deal with booths and stuff.

680
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:30,270
Rym: But it was the first time I traveled extensively on corporate money as opposed to my own money, and that's a very interesting experience.

681
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,136
Scott: It's the opposite of we go to a convention, and they're like, "$10 hot

682
00:30:33,156 --> 00:30:33,337
Scott: dog.".

683
00:30:33,357 --> 00:30:33,818
Scott: You're like, "Are you

684
00:30:33,858 --> 00:30:34,259
Scott: crazy?".

685
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:35,341
Scott: Now it's like, "$10 hot dog.

686
00:30:35,361 --> 00:30:35,923
Scott: Who gives a shit?

687
00:30:35,943 --> 00:30:36,584
Scott: It's not my money.

688
00:30:36,604 --> 00:30:38,789
Scott: I want a hot dog, and I don't want to walk anywhere.

689
00:30:38,829 --> 00:30:38,930
Scott: Give

690
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:38,990
Scott: me.".

691
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:47,630
Rym: Even better, what's interesting is that when you're in this position, you're kind of obligated to take other businessmen out to eat and stuff like that.

692
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:53,730
Rym: So basically, it's expected that you're going to spend a ton of money on room service and cocktails and all that kind of crazy stuff.

693
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:57,984
Rym: But I'll try to skip the business-y stuff, but I flew to Mumbai.

694
00:30:58,486 --> 00:30:59,390
Rym: You may know it as Bombay.

695
00:30:59,551 --> 00:31:02,240
Rym: Now what's interesting is it's Mumbai.

696
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,525
Rym: That's the official name of the city.

697
00:31:03,565 --> 00:31:05,050
Rym: That's kind of what you're expected to say.

698
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:06,610
Scott: So it's written on all the things?

699
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:10,030
Rym: And I'd gotten the impression that everyone called it Mumbai.

700
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:10,970
Scott: No, they say Bombay.

701
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:16,563
Rym: So when I got there, the only people who said Mumbai were foreigners and rich people.

702
00:31:17,004 --> 00:31:19,370
Rym: And everyone else that I met called it Bombay.

703
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:19,851
Scott: Yep.

704
00:31:20,177 --> 00:31:20,870
Scott: I've heard that already.

705
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:26,170
Rym: But what's really funny is we got to meet some executives from the Bombay Stock Exchange, the BSE.

706
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:33,110
Rym: They call it the BSE now because they don't want to change the name to the Mumbai Stock Exchange or change the acronym or anything.

707
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:39,610
Rym: Because imagine how much of a pain in the ass it would be if you have all these network things named something publicly and you have to rename everything.

708
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:43,710
Rym: Imagine if you had to rename all the variables and class names in your code because of some BS.

709
00:31:45,233 --> 00:31:46,167
Rym: But the cool thing was...

710
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:46,908
Scott: It's called SED.

711
00:31:48,111 --> 00:31:50,206
Rym: Yeah, but that may or may not work well depending on...

712
00:31:50,791 --> 00:31:51,409
Scott: You got to do it right.

713
00:31:51,710 --> 00:32:01,110
Rym: Well, one of the worst things in the world is when you're trying to fix some code and you find out that the name of a class was actually spelled wrong in the first place.

714
00:32:02,513 --> 00:32:03,369
Rym: That's like the worst.

715
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,669
Rym: But I digress.

716
00:32:07,251 --> 00:32:16,030
Rym: I got to meet a bunch of people who run the Bombay Stock Exchange and we went up to their tower and I realized at the top that it was really the only tall building in that area of Bombay.

717
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:21,970
Rym: And the guy introduces us and we realized we can see the entire city out these windows.

718
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,095
Rym: And I look and I see all this military stuff.

719
00:32:24,115 --> 00:32:25,940
Rym: He's like, "That's the entire Indian Navy.

720
00:32:26,823 --> 00:32:28,086
Rym: Don't take any pictures.

721
00:32:28,167 --> 00:32:28,949
Rym: We'll get in a lot of

722
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:29,250
Rym: trouble.".

723
00:32:30,431 --> 00:32:36,229
Rym: And apparently after the Mumbai terrorist attacks, India's got some problems like many places in the world do.

724
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:42,590
Rym: So you're not allowed to have tall buildings in that area because you can basically spy on the military.

725
00:32:43,173 --> 00:32:46,330
Rym: And the buildings are targets for attacks, which is actually a concern there.

726
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:47,533
Scott: That reminds me of this dude.

727
00:32:47,553 --> 00:32:52,449
Scott: There was a photo an astronaut posted and it was like, "What was the craziest thing you saw from

728
00:32:52,529 --> 00:32:52,790
Scott: space?".

729
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:53,373
Scott: And he's like, "Look at

730
00:32:53,413 --> 00:32:53,594
Scott: this.".

731
00:32:53,654 --> 00:32:56,790
Scott: And there was this line on the Earth and it was this glowing line.

732
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:59,382
Scott: And he's like, "That's the India-Pakistan border.

733
00:32:59,824 --> 00:33:00,447
Scott: It's a glowing

734
00:33:00,487 --> 00:33:00,849
Scott: line.".

735
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:04,490
Scott: You can see it more easily than you can see the Great Wall of China.

736
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,664
Rym: Actually, the Great Wall of China is one of the hardest things to see.

737
00:33:07,684 --> 00:33:08,830
Rym: It's not visible from space.

738
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,579
Scott: Right, but you could clearly see this thing.

739
00:33:11,659 --> 00:33:15,050
Scott: It looked like a string of light bulbs that were just ridiculously long.

740
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:16,576
Scott: And I was like, "Whoa.

741
00:33:16,596 --> 00:33:17,806
Scott: That's for serious,

742
00:33:17,846 --> 00:33:17,987
Scott: yo.".

743
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:24,830
Scott: So by law, you can't really see the other contentious borders around the world, but you can't really see them from space.

744
00:33:25,632 --> 00:33:28,790
Rym: Well, you can see the implicit North Korea-South Korea border.

745
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:29,853
Scott: Well, that's different.

746
00:33:29,873 --> 00:33:33,770
Scott: You can just see it at night because it's dark and then South Korea actually has lights.

747
00:33:34,651 --> 00:33:39,490
Rym: So they can't have legally tall buildings there, but the government was kind of smart about it.

748
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,930
Rym: They're like, "Yeah, we're not going to make you tear down the only already existing tall building.

749
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,981
Rym: Don't let people take pictures of the Navy.

750
00:33:46,001 --> 00:33:47,167
Rym: You'll get in

751
00:33:47,207 --> 00:33:47,569
Rym: trouble.".

752
00:33:48,413 --> 00:33:51,087
Rym: But it was a really great view and I wish I could have taken a picture.

753
00:33:51,107 --> 00:33:51,589
Rym: It was really...

754
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:55,850
Scott: You should have just taken one illicitly and then posted it anonymously on like, Imgur or something.

755
00:33:56,210 --> 00:34:01,250
Rym: Yeah, I don't want to deal with that, especially because I may or may not be trying to do business with the Bombay Stock Exchange.

756
00:34:01,491 --> 00:34:03,499
Scott: No, you just don't post it until the business is done.

757
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,247
Scott: You obviously wouldn't go home and post it immediately.

758
00:34:05,287 --> 00:34:05,910
Scott: Then they know it was you.

759
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:11,350
Scott: You do it like months later when it could have been anyone who visited in any of those months or even like a year later.

760
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,273
Rym: Nah, because think about it.

761
00:34:12,293 --> 00:34:14,081
Rym: So I take a picture of the Indian Navy, right?

762
00:34:14,563 --> 00:34:16,190
Rym: Say the picture gets out and there's some bullshit.

763
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:21,146
Rym: Some Navy intelligence guy over there is going to look at the picture and be like, "All right, these are the ships that were in

764
00:34:21,206 --> 00:34:21,487
Rym: part.".

765
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:23,949
Scott: Didn't he say it was the whole Navy?

766
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,094
Rym: Well, no, that's the Navy part.

767
00:34:26,175 --> 00:34:29,125
Rym: I'm sure a ship or two were out doing stuff.

768
00:34:29,225 --> 00:34:30,690
Rym: They move them around in the part.

769
00:34:30,731 --> 00:34:31,289
Rym: Oh, okay.

770
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,335
Rym: But it was a really impressive view.

771
00:34:34,036 --> 00:34:37,647
Rym: But the funny thing, so I flew Air India and it wasn't a coach.

772
00:34:37,687 --> 00:34:38,730
Rym: It was actual Air India.

773
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:40,668
Scott: Well, Air India isn't exactly Lufthansa.

774
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:46,730
Rym: So the domestic flights within India were way more comfortable than JetBlue, like way nice.

775
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:47,455
Rym: That's nice.

776
00:34:47,777 --> 00:34:48,870
Scott: But were you first class?

777
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:49,627
Rym: No, God no.

778
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,770
Rym: God no, our company's doing well about that one.

779
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,498
Scott: But the thing about JetBlue is it's not supposed to be the crazy comfortable.

780
00:34:54,539 --> 00:34:57,869
Scott: It's supposed to be everything's the same, it's simple, it's cheap, it works.

781
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:00,970
Rym: The on Air India domestic flight was way comfortable.

782
00:35:01,234 --> 00:35:02,189
Scott: It was way more monies too.

783
00:35:02,471 --> 00:35:04,030
Rym: No, it was actually way cheap.

784
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:10,342
Rym: The international flight was literally the most uncomfortable chair.

785
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:14,110
Rym: that was actually a chair I've ever sat on in my entire life.

786
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:16,050
Scott: Was it just like a wooden stick that shoved up your butt?

787
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:20,070
Rym: There was this bar like shoving its way into my ass through this thin ass cushion.

788
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,099
Scott: Was it a broken chair?

789
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,370
Scott: Were all the chairs the same?

790
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:25,349
Rym: I think they were all the same because the guy next to me was squirming the whole time.

791
00:35:25,812 --> 00:35:27,902
Rym: And then I look at him and I'm like, "Is there a

792
00:35:27,962 --> 00:35:28,324
Rym: bar?".

793
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,630
Rym: He's like right in my butt.

794
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,762
Rym: And I was like, "Okay, it's not just

795
00:35:31,823 --> 00:35:31,943
Rym: me.".

796
00:35:32,935 --> 00:35:33,290
Scott: Okay.

797
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,240
Rym: But I engineered a solution.

798
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:38,049
Scott: I asked for like- A pillow and you put it under your ass?

799
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,273
Rym: They didn't have any extra pillows.

800
00:35:39,615 --> 00:35:44,650
Rym: So I asked for like eight blankets and I manufactured a device of blankets that worked okay.

801
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,661
Scott: You know what the answer is?

802
00:35:46,682 --> 00:35:48,289
Scott: If you were to go to India- First class.

803
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:49,495
Scott: Or a seat cushion.

804
00:35:49,717 --> 00:35:51,750
Scott: Just bring a seat cushion like the kind they use at football stadiums.

805
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,250
Rym: Yeah, I try to travel really light and not carry stuff on me.

806
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,810
Scott: Or you can get the neck pillow and just put it under your butt instead.

807
00:35:57,070 --> 00:36:05,090
Rym: The other important thing about the flight is that I now have ample evidence to say that I do not in fact suffer from jet lag and/or jet lag is a myth.

808
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:05,606
Rym: Yeah.

809
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:07,335
Rym: I'm very happy about that.

810
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:11,430
Rym: I got there and everyone who flew with me like all the other people were wicked jet lagged.

811
00:36:11,851 --> 00:36:17,330
Rym: And literally I fly into India, it's evening, I get some dinner, I wander around, I go to bed, I wake up the next morning feeling great.

812
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:17,679
Rym: Yeah.

813
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:22,227
Rym: And everyone else like couldn't eat and bleh and bleh and bleh and bleh and I was fine.

814
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:22,770
Rym: It was awesome.

815
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:23,790
Rym: I think it's psychological.

816
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,569
Rym: No, it actually is a real thing.

817
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:26,163
Scott: I don't know.

818
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,109
Rym: But some people are apparently immune to it.

819
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:28,670
Rym: Okay.

820
00:36:29,176 --> 00:36:30,658
Scott: And- I've never had much of a problem with it.

821
00:36:30,678 --> 00:36:32,350
Scott: It's not a noticeable one.

822
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,798
Rym: When was the last time you flew?

823
00:36:33,879 --> 00:36:35,290
Rym: more than five time zones?

824
00:36:36,151 --> 00:36:37,110
Scott: More than five times?

825
00:36:37,131 --> 00:36:37,217
Scott: Yeah.

826
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:39,288
Rym: Yeah, so when was that?

827
00:36:40,274 --> 00:36:41,190
Scott: Uh, 2000.

828
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,019
Rym: Okay, that was 12 years ago.

829
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:43,310
Rym: Yeah.

830
00:36:44,334 --> 00:36:44,650
Rym: Anyway.

831
00:36:45,711 --> 00:36:54,936
Rym: But the only problem that I have when I fly, because the same thing happened to Japan, is every day around 9, 30, 10 o'clock at night, I'm so tired.

832
00:36:55,116 --> 00:36:59,928
Rym: The second night I was there, I got out of this conference, go to my room and I'm like, "I'm going to check some

833
00:36:59,948 --> 00:37:00,269
Rym: internet.".

834
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:09,330
Rym: And I literally opened my laptop and I remember starting to type my password in and then I woke up the next morning in the chair.

835
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:13,530
Rym: The laptop was still sitting on my lap and I hadn't finished typing my password.

836
00:37:13,791 --> 00:37:15,249
Scott: Are you sure that wasn't jet lag?

837
00:37:15,991 --> 00:37:17,190
Rym: Scott, it was like 10 o'clock at night.

838
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:22,310
Rym: So if that was jet lag, then jet lag's fine because it meant I went to bed at a reasonable goddamn hour.

839
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:26,369
Rym: And I woke up at like 7 o'clock, which was when I wanted to wake up.

840
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:32,650
Rym: Jet lag means you're not hungry and you can't get up in the morning and you're way tired all day.

841
00:37:32,811 --> 00:37:33,889
Scott: I definitely don't have that problem.

842
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:40,330
Rym: So, you know, I get to Mumbai and I get a driver and he takes me to the fancy hotel.

843
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:49,574
Rym: And the fancy hotel, Mumbai is weird because it's like ultra luxury, like this, like, "Shall I warm so's crack

844
00:37:49,614 --> 00:37:49,875
Rym: pipe?"

845
00:37:50,055 --> 00:37:54,910
Rym: fails to describe the opulent care that was taken of me when I showed up at this hotel.

846
00:37:56,111 --> 00:38:01,629
Rym: Meanwhile, outside of the hotel were some straight up shantytown, sea of gods slums.

847
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:03,850
Scott: It's basically Monaco, only bigger.

848
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,356
Rym: Yeah, and more distributed.

849
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:09,730
Rym: Like the slums are integrated and they're not all slums.

850
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:14,070
Rym: Some of them are just very, very dense populated like residential areas.

851
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:21,290
Rym: Some of them are shantytowns, but then like right next to it is like ultra luxury like hotel or ultra luxury condos.

852
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:28,510
Scott: So, you know, in Monaco it's pretty much rich stuff in the middle, rich stuff in the water, and then the poor stuff is like on the outskirts.

853
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:29,889
Rym: Yeah, Mumbai is so dense.

854
00:38:30,091 --> 00:38:35,770
Scott: This is all intermingled, which is kind of great because in the US, right, we got rich and poor, but they're all super separated.

855
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:38,810
Scott: Rich people live in the woods on long roads with gates.

856
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:48,710
Rym: And in New York, like in New York City, there's ultra rich and there's the American equivalent of very poor, but you don't get to the level of the shantytowns in our cities.

857
00:38:49,513 --> 00:38:51,109
Rym: Our equivalent of that is like Appalachia.

858
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:54,310
Scott: Or you live in like one of the, you know, projects, you know, public housing, whatever.

859
00:38:54,771 --> 00:38:55,648
Rym: So, you know, I give the hotel...

860
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:56,249
Scott: It's not a shantytown.

861
00:38:56,370 --> 00:39:06,570
Rym: Of course, every building that I went into for this entire trip had even like malls and everything had metal detectors and security at every door and like crazy security everywhere.

862
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:08,857
Rym: But the security was actually effective.

863
00:39:08,877 --> 00:39:12,290
Rym: They just made you walk through a metal detector and they were smart about it.

864
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:18,810
Rym: Like every time I walked through my cell phone and my wallet would beep and the guy would like grab it outside my pocket.

865
00:39:19,531 --> 00:39:24,089
Rym: And he had this look on his face like this is a white guy and it's obviously a cell phone.

866
00:39:24,774 --> 00:39:27,270
Rym: He didn't like freak out about the bulge in my pocket.

867
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,548
Rym: It clearly was not a gun.

868
00:39:29,654 --> 00:39:31,070
Rym: But the security was pretty reasonable.

869
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:36,010
Rym: Like it amazes me how the countries that have actual terrorism have reasonable security.

870
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:37,250
Scott: We had actual terrorism.

871
00:39:37,531 --> 00:39:41,069
Rym: We had actual terrorism over a decade ago.

872
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:41,688
Scott: Right.

873
00:39:42,391 --> 00:39:47,710
Rym: And yet we have security theater that is both more intrusive and less effective than what goes on in like India.

874
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:52,590
Rym: I'm so pissed off about that, but I'm not going to... This isn't a show about me complaining about security in the TSA.

875
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,249
Scott: No, that's every show.

876
00:39:53,702 --> 00:39:53,949
Rym: I know.

877
00:39:55,171 --> 00:39:58,530
Rym: But so I, you know, I get some dinner and then I decided to wander around Mumbai.

878
00:39:58,770 --> 00:39:59,949
Rym: So I go to walk out of the hotel.

879
00:40:01,011 --> 00:40:03,730
Rym: They were a guest like, where is Sir going?

880
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:04,750
Rym: Where is Sir's driver?

881
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,950
Rym: Like they were insistent like, where's your driver?

882
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:08,570
Rym: Should we get your driver?

883
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,709
Rym: Should we get your car ready?

884
00:40:10,372 --> 00:40:10,918
Rym: What do you mean?

885
00:40:10,939 --> 00:40:11,789
Rym: you're walking out?

886
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:12,610
Rym: Where are you going?

887
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:14,570
Rym: And I was like, I'm just going somewhere.

888
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:15,118
Rym: I'm walking out.

889
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:15,568
Rym: I'll be back.

890
00:40:16,232 --> 00:40:19,350
Rym: And I kind of walked by over all their protests and wandered out in the streets.

891
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,330
Scott: Did like Google Maps work?

892
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,429
Scott: Could you find your way back with that?

893
00:40:22,172 --> 00:40:25,010
Rym: Yeah, so I didn't have data there because of my CDMA phone.

894
00:40:25,431 --> 00:40:28,430
Scott: But you had your, oh, everything there is GSM.

895
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:28,885
Rym: Yes.

896
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,810
Scott: You couldn't get a temporary phone with your corporate credit card?

897
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:32,530
Rym: I didn't bother.

898
00:40:33,533 --> 00:40:35,350
Rym: I had a temporary phone, but I hadn't hooked it up yet.

899
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:36,610
Rym: Like I hadn't gotten the data plan going.

900
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:37,923
Scott: But it was just a regular phone.

901
00:40:37,943 --> 00:40:38,510
Scott: or was it a smartphone?

902
00:40:38,871 --> 00:40:39,410
Rym: It was a smartphone.

903
00:40:39,635 --> 00:40:39,889
Scott: Oh, okay.

904
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:44,550
Rym: So what I did is I turned on Google tracks and I started tracking because GPS works fine.

905
00:40:44,951 --> 00:40:49,230
Rym: So if I got lost, I could at least see where I started and navigate back to that.

906
00:40:50,498 --> 00:40:51,270
Rym: And that actually works.

907
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:53,910
Rym: I wandered way, way off into Mumbai.

908
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,209
Rym: I wandered through some of the.

909
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:57,630
Scott: But if it was night, how did you like not get hit by cars and shit?

910
00:40:58,512 --> 00:41:00,769
Rym: So that was actually a concern.

911
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:01,730
Scott: No kidding.

912
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:11,490
Rym: So you see videos of like India and you see, you know, basically a three lane road in India is actually a five lane road plus two motorcycle lanes, you know, sidewalks.

913
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:13,881
Rym: And it is amazing.

914
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:18,270
Rym: There is literally no such thing as traffic laws there as far as I can tell.

915
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:21,430
Rym: Or at least if there are traffic laws, no one cares.

916
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:25,465
Rym: But you get this impression watching those videos.

917
00:41:25,485 --> 00:41:26,350
Rym: that is totally safe.

918
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:31,370
Rym: And like everyone because everyone's going so slow and paying so much attention that, you know, it just kind of works.

919
00:41:31,671 --> 00:41:33,670
Scott: Like in the videos, it's like you see crazy shit.

920
00:41:33,731 --> 00:41:35,870
Scott: But you also see people, you know, they're slowing down.

921
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:36,650
Scott: They're taking their time.

922
00:41:36,691 --> 00:41:37,789
Scott: They're waiting for the spot.

923
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:38,365
Scott: Then they move in.

924
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:39,450
Rym: No, thousands die.

925
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:40,509
Rym: The roads are death traps.

926
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,910
Rym: Road deaths are one of the biggest problems in India.

927
00:41:43,231 --> 00:41:44,088
Rym: So many people die.

928
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:45,149
Rym: It is crazy.

929
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:51,970
Rym: So I walk out into the street and I'm on this kind of sidewalk and it's fine, except occasionally shanties were like built into the sidewalks.

930
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:52,908
Rym: I have to like get around them.

931
00:41:53,393 --> 00:41:55,070
Rym: And that's a big problem in India, encroachment.

932
00:41:55,491 --> 00:41:56,609
Rym: People will like have a building.

933
00:41:57,071 --> 00:42:02,090
Rym: And then one day they put like some corrugated steel like around like a foot out from their store.

934
00:42:02,932 --> 00:42:05,690
Rym: And then they quietly take down the wall inside their building.

935
00:42:06,212 --> 00:42:08,469
Rym: And then they put the wall back up right at the edge of the steel.

936
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,649
Rym: And then they move the steel another foot out.

937
00:42:11,913 --> 00:42:13,130
Rym: Stuff like that happens all the time.

938
00:42:13,271 --> 00:42:15,770
Scott: Why would you want to make your building longer?

939
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:16,890
Rym: Oh, you want more space.

940
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:20,170
Rym: Eventually you make up enough space to have an apartment in there or another store.

941
00:42:20,672 --> 00:42:22,450
Scott: You give it a whole store in the sidewalk space?

942
00:42:22,595 --> 00:42:22,685
Rym: Yeah.

943
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:26,470
Rym: It's like there are some stores that were literally the size of like a closet.

944
00:42:27,182 --> 00:42:27,245
Scott: Oh.

945
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:28,568
Rym: That's just how it is.

946
00:42:28,711 --> 00:42:30,109
Rym: It's very, very, very dense.

947
00:42:31,232 --> 00:42:33,670
Rym: I mean, India is a nation of more than a billion people.

948
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:35,110
Scott: It's like if you can get a square inch, you're good.

949
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:35,517
Scott: Yeah.

950
00:42:35,914 --> 00:42:36,042
Scott: Yeah.

951
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:38,530
Rym: So, but I wandered around through the streets.

952
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:45,412
Rym: And the thing is, everyone was like, I was kind of impressed at how friendly everyone is.

953
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:46,690
Scott: Why wouldn't they be friendly?

954
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:48,710
Rym: Because, you know, in New York, everyone's not friendly.

955
00:42:49,053 --> 00:42:50,110
Rym: They're trying their best.

956
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:56,448
Scott: The thing is, right, is like when you're packed in with a lot of people, you got to be friendly because not friendly doesn't work when you're so packed in with them.

957
00:42:56,870 --> 00:43:03,010
Rym: But I think because you're more packed in, there's like this extra onus to be friendly because you're really like in it together.

958
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:03,788
Rym: Something goes down.

959
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:04,286
Scott: Yeah.

960
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:04,834
Scott: And it's like you're.

961
00:43:04,894 --> 00:43:11,230
Scott: just you're basically, you know, it's like you're when you're on the subway, you know, you're friendly because you're packed in like sardines, right?

962
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:13,290
Scott: You're not going to be a jerk on the subway unless you're crazy.

963
00:43:13,851 --> 00:43:19,550
Scott: But you know, you can be a jerk when like, you know, you can go home and be all alone and not have to deal with the people yelling at you for being a jerk.

964
00:43:19,711 --> 00:43:23,530
Rym: So the way I figured out to walk around is I kind of watch what everyone else did and kind of followed crowds.

965
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:27,310
Rym: Like I didn't walk anywhere that I didn't see someone else walking first.

966
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:28,608
Rym: I was always following someone.

967
00:43:29,571 --> 00:43:34,130
Rym: And good strategy probably saved my life because there were straight up death traps.

968
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:39,889
Rym: Like you could walk and without realizing it be in the middle of like train tracks or like crazy highway.

969
00:43:40,476 --> 00:43:40,969
Scott: Not death traps.

970
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:41,989
Scott: Like someone's going to kill you.

971
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:42,345
Rym: No, no.

972
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:48,369
Rym: Death traps like a motorcycle is going to hit you because there's a thousand of them and none of them have headlights and no one has helmets.

973
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:57,829
Rym: I rode some motorcycles, my co-workers, you know, they took me around town like when I was in a hydro bed later and I just got to ride on the back of motorcycles through this crazy traffic.

974
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:58,668
Rym: No one wears helmets.

975
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:03,570
Rym: It was it actually made me reminded me how awesome motorcycles are and I kind of want one again.

976
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:11,090
Scott: Well, if we go to India, you know, I can do first thing at the airport, get a driver, buy a helmet where I did not see a helmet for sale anywhere.

977
00:44:11,311 --> 00:44:11,750
Scott: We could bring one.

978
00:44:12,313 --> 00:44:12,868
Rym: I guess you could.

979
00:44:13,291 --> 00:44:17,550
Scott: I wouldn't need I wouldn't necessarily bring like a crazy one like door if you're going to go around India.

980
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:18,068
Rym: Here's the trick.

981
00:44:18,791 --> 00:44:24,968
Rym: It costs maybe 20 or 30 bucks to have a driver for an entire day who will drive you anywhere you want.

982
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:26,029
Scott: But the road is still a death trap.

983
00:44:26,211 --> 00:44:27,589
Scott: You can get killed and still drive.

984
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:27,820
Scott: No.

985
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:30,569
Rym: And if you're in a car, you're basically safe because you're not going to get hit hard.

986
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:34,770
Rym: The people who die or the people on motorcycles are in the little tuk tuks or the pedestrians.

987
00:44:35,971 --> 00:44:37,330
Rym: But in a car you're safe.

988
00:44:37,491 --> 00:44:45,390
Rym: And for like 20 or 30 bucks, a guy will drive you around all day, wait for you anywhere you go, take care of all your all your like baggage and everything.

989
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:47,350
Scott: And the cars must be cheap or what?

990
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:48,328
Scott: Like what kind of car is this?

991
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:50,090
Rym: Well, because the exchange rate is interesting.

992
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:51,709
Rym: It's about a thousand rupees.

993
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:53,935
Rym: Like a thousand rupee note is like a 20.

994
00:44:53,935 --> 00:44:54,041
Scott: OK.

995
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,129
Rym: Twenty dollars.

996
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:55,668
Scott: That's not bad.

997
00:44:55,971 --> 00:45:02,570
Rym: But the prices because of this, like half the country, like the country is modernizing so quickly.

998
00:45:03,171 --> 00:45:17,509
Rym: And yet there's this huge like mass of population that the disparity between rich and poor and the economies of these different areas are diverging so rapidly that in the five star hotel, I drop the equivalent of like a hundred bucks on dinner.

999
00:45:18,432 --> 00:45:20,863
Rym: And then the room service was actually.

1000
00:45:21,425 --> 00:45:22,490
Rym: what do you think was the rooms?

1001
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:22,970
Rym: What do you think?

1002
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:23,549
Rym: What do you think?

1003
00:45:23,692 --> 00:45:24,710
Scott: Indian room service.

1004
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:29,010
Scott: I'm usually I'm usually the best at room service guessing game, but not when it's a foreign country.

1005
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:33,890
Rym: Five star hotel designed for foreigners who are rich businessmen at a conference.

1006
00:45:34,695 --> 00:45:35,247
Rym: What do you think?

1007
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:39,530
Rym: Two eggs over easy and some toast would cost room service delivery.

1008
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:41,125
Scott: So in the US, that's like 40 bucks.

1009
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:41,743
Rym: Yeah.

1010
00:45:42,392 --> 00:45:42,930
Rym: If you're lucky.

1011
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:43,768
Scott: If you're lucky.

1012
00:45:44,251 --> 00:45:47,950
Scott: Right now, because I'm not going to it is a five star hotel and it's fancy.

1013
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:49,450
Scott: So not going to be like one dollar.

1014
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:49,863
Scott: Yeah.

1015
00:45:50,071 --> 00:45:50,594
Scott: And I'm not going to.

1016
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:54,050
Scott: it's got to be more expensive than like the diner here, which is like five bucks.

1017
00:45:54,111 --> 00:45:55,090
Rym: It was cheaper than the diner.

1018
00:45:55,732 --> 00:45:57,230
Scott: It's got to be like room service was cheaper.

1019
00:45:57,752 --> 00:45:58,588
Scott: It's like seven, eight.

1020
00:45:59,070 --> 00:45:59,390
Rym: No, Scott.

1021
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:04,428
Rym: I use the mini bar in my room because it was cheaper than what I pay for some of those things that a convenience store in the US.

1022
00:46:04,611 --> 00:46:05,144
Rym: Are you kidding me?

1023
00:46:05,556 --> 00:46:05,970
Rym: Oh, my God.

1024
00:46:06,417 --> 00:46:06,848
Rym: I opened it.

1025
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:07,790
Rym: I was I wanted a Red Bull.

1026
00:46:07,951 --> 00:46:08,730
Rym: I really need some cat.

1027
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:09,290
Scott: They had it there.

1028
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:18,900
Rym: There was Red Bull in the mini fridge and I'm like and I pick it up, I'm like, all right, this is going on the corporate card, but I'll get in trouble if I have a ten dollar Red Bull.

1029
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:19,610
Rym: Of course.

1030
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:21,762
Rym: And I look at the sheet and it's like a dollar.

1031
00:46:21,782 --> 00:46:22,709
Rym: seventy five like a white.

1032
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:27,409
Scott: You should just ask for a case at that price because so there are two bucks here.

1033
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:31,149
Scott: I know you should be like, hey, how many Red Bulls can you guys get me?

1034
00:46:32,531 --> 00:46:35,402
Rym: But yeah, room service was cheap, but like outside, like.

1035
00:46:35,442 --> 00:46:41,710
Rym: I went to a restaurant like a normal restaurant to get dosa, which is basically like a crepe.

1036
00:46:42,011 --> 00:46:45,368
Rym: It's the one Indian food I've never really seen in the US, but it's whatever.

1037
00:46:45,388 --> 00:46:45,948
Rym: it is for breakfast.

1038
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:46,610
Rym: It's like a crepe.

1039
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:48,015
Scott: So was the Indian food there like?

1040
00:46:48,236 --> 00:46:51,872
Scott: is our Indian food like the way Chinese food is or it's not the same?

1041
00:46:52,013 --> 00:46:57,849
Rym: or is it the same stuff like, you know, it's actually well in New York, it's actually mostly the same.

1042
00:46:58,251 --> 00:47:02,609
Rym: Other than that, the meat there was so much more tender.

1043
00:47:03,572 --> 00:47:04,196
Rym: The last like.

1044
00:47:04,216 --> 00:47:06,490
Scott: I mean, I imagine there's less food regulations.

1045
00:47:06,955 --> 00:47:07,105
Rym: Yeah.

1046
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:07,829
Rym: But here's the thing.

1047
00:47:08,291 --> 00:47:13,850
Rym: The most of the places I ate at just because the nature of my travel were like ultra fancy five star restaurants.

1048
00:47:14,292 --> 00:47:20,069
Rym: So it's hard to compare because I was having the five star Indian food versus the three star equivalent in the US.

1049
00:47:20,477 --> 00:47:20,910
Scott: All right.

1050
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:23,170
Scott: Because when we get Indian food, it's just like regular restaurant.

1051
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:25,010
Scott: We don't go to the five star Indian restaurant.

1052
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:27,810
Rym: So that really good Indian place where I used to go to and fish kill.

1053
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:28,090
Rym: Right.

1054
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:32,610
Rym: The meat was a thousand times more tender than that.

1055
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:33,023
Scott: Yeah.

1056
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:34,076
Scott: I bet they just probably like.

1057
00:47:34,096 --> 00:47:36,550
Scott: this is a five star restaurant, though, and it's in India.

1058
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:39,530
Scott: They probably just like, you know, they got that Tandoori Rock.

1059
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:40,850
Rym: They really care about the chicken.

1060
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:46,309
Rym: When I was in Hyderabad, there were so many like stalls, like a shop that was like, look at our chickens.

1061
00:47:46,472 --> 00:47:47,510
Rym: We take awesome care of them.

1062
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:47,909
Rym: Check them out.

1063
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:48,607
Rym: Here's some of them.

1064
00:47:49,011 --> 00:47:50,270
Rym: Here's why our eggs are so great.

1065
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:52,119
Rym: Here's videos of how we take care of our chickens.

1066
00:47:52,139 --> 00:47:55,209
Rym: like eggs are a big goddamn deal with so many vegetarians and such.

1067
00:47:56,134 --> 00:47:56,489
Rym: Oh, it's cool.

1068
00:47:56,711 --> 00:47:57,310
Scott: And the culture there.

1069
00:47:57,350 --> 00:48:00,007
Scott: So it's like if you're going to eat meat, you know, people are only.

1070
00:48:00,027 --> 00:48:03,610
Scott: you know, a lot of people probably won't eat the meat unless it's like so in America.

1071
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:03,762
Rym: Right.

1072
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:08,374
Rym: It's like smoking or not is like the question you get in, I guess, backwater shitty places in the U.S.

1073
00:48:08,917 --> 00:48:10,809
Rym: because, you know, that's gone in modern places like New York.

1074
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:15,008
Rym: But that question, that equivalent in India is basically veg or non veg.

1075
00:48:15,971 --> 00:48:20,730
Rym: So everything you get from fast food everywhere like McDonald's there has veg and non veg options for everything.

1076
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:26,510
Rym: KFC has half the menus vegetarian and actually KFC there is pretty good.

1077
00:48:27,031 --> 00:48:29,130
Scott: Wait, what is KFC vegetarian menu?

1078
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:30,229
Scott: They don't have any vegetables.

1079
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:34,310
Rym: Yes, KFC there does because it's just potato and potato.

1080
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:35,308
Scott: I mean, what else do they have?

1081
00:48:35,551 --> 00:48:40,530
Rym: They have other vegetables like a whole bunch that you can get, like green beans, beans and potatoes.

1082
00:48:41,139 --> 00:48:41,390
Scott: Great.

1083
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,730
Rym: I've got you've eaten Indian food, right?

1084
00:48:43,991 --> 00:48:45,709
Rym: Yeah, there's vegetables in that shit.

1085
00:48:46,033 --> 00:48:46,808
Scott: But this is KFC.

1086
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:47,793
Scott: What is KFC?

1087
00:48:47,833 --> 00:48:52,104
Rym: have the same vegetables that Indian food has prepared in various different ways?

1088
00:48:52,312 --> 00:48:53,029
Scott: I want to see the menu.

1089
00:48:53,211 --> 00:48:58,229
Rym: They have like veggie sandwiches and things, but like I was at the airport, like I was really hungry.

1090
00:48:58,452 --> 00:49:00,770
Rym: So I got like a Domino's pizza because I was in a hurry.

1091
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:01,588
Scott: I actually had Domino's.

1092
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:02,830
Rym: So the pizza options are great.

1093
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:09,307
Rym: It was veggie pizza, non veggie pizza, spicy pizza or spicy veggie pizza, spicy non veggie pizza.

1094
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:09,830
Scott: Oh my God.

1095
00:49:10,131 --> 00:49:12,310
Scott: That spicy veggie pizza must have been so spicy, right?

1096
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:14,630
Rym: Wasn't that spicy?

1097
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:15,389
Scott: Oh yeah, that's what you ordered.

1098
00:49:15,971 --> 00:49:20,327
Rym: But that was the spiciest thing I ate because I didn't end up going to a restaurant that actually had vindaloo.

1099
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:22,588
Rym: Just because, you know, I was only there for a week.

1100
00:49:23,793 --> 00:49:24,569
Scott: That's a lot of days.

1101
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:31,370
Rym: But the baseline Indian food is about as spicy as so-called spicy Indian food here.

1102
00:49:31,872 --> 00:49:36,349
Rym: Like I got some chicken biryani because of Hyderabad, like the chicken biryani is supposedly like famous.

1103
00:49:37,011 --> 00:49:38,190
Scott: Always get the local specialty.

1104
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:38,830
Rym: Oh my God.

1105
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:40,070
Rym: That was the best biryani ever.

1106
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:41,530
Scott: Always get the local specialty.

1107
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:44,010
Rym: But that biryani was way spicier than any biryani I've ever had.

1108
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:45,430
Rym: Go to Rochester and get the garbage plate.

1109
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:46,088
Scott: That's how it works.

1110
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:49,330
Rym: So I asked the coworkers, I was like, so how spicy is this?

1111
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:50,430
Rym: They were like, what do you mean spicy?

1112
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:51,769
Scott: It's not spicy.

1113
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:53,070
Rym: You want spicy?

1114
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:53,769
Rym: You'll die.

1115
00:49:55,471 --> 00:50:03,460
Scott: Do they have like, every restaurant has like a bottle of pure cap in the back and they're just like, you know, using like a turkey baster and going squirting it all over the place.

1116
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:04,410
Scott: I mean, what are they doing?

1117
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:14,526
Rym: But so in a normal restaurant, I got an entire meal, like a meal that I could not finish for 40 rupees.

1118
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:17,045
Scott: When you said a thousand rupees is a

1119
00:50:17,045 --> 00:50:17,790
Scott: 20? 40

1120
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:19,570
Scott: rupees is like a dollar.

1121
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:21,630
Rym: Okay.

1122
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:22,174
Rym: Yeah.

1123
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:30,365
Rym: So the despair, basically you can go around India on a ton of money or effectively no money.

1124
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:32,010
Scott: Well, see, I think this is the thing, right?

1125
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:32,312
Scott: It's like you.

1126
00:50:32,332 --> 00:50:32,937
Scott: look at the U.S.

1127
00:50:32,957 --> 00:50:36,009
Scott: and everyone, you know, we're all complaining about like the disparity of wealth, right?

1128
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:37,520
Rym: Yeah, the gap between the rich and the poor in the U.S.

1129
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:39,450
Rym: basically doesn't exist compared to most of the world.

1130
00:50:39,591 --> 00:50:39,825
Scott: Well, no, no.

1131
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:41,450
Scott: It's like this gigantic disparity.

1132
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:43,298
Scott: But everyone in the U.S.

1133
00:50:43,318 --> 00:50:45,630
Scott: has the same prices, mostly, right?

1134
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:47,709
Scott: It's not like poor people get cheaper.

1135
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:48,508
Scott: You know.

1136
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:49,247
Rym: Scott, they do.

1137
00:50:50,115 --> 00:50:50,669
Rym: Here's an example.

1138
00:50:51,491 --> 00:50:55,350
Rym: In Rochester, me and Scott Johnson, we're at like, I think it was Astronomicon.

1139
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:57,590
Rym: Remember, we used to go and like do events for the anime club.

1140
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:00,469
Rym: So we go because no one else would fucking go and help us.

1141
00:51:00,811 --> 00:51:01,090
Scott: I wouldn't go.

1142
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:02,167
Scott: Why would I go?

1143
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:04,270
Rym: So we were really hungry.

1144
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:09,370
Rym: And remember, I was kind of poor and Skodro didn't have a lot of money on him at the time either.

1145
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:16,088
Rym: So we're walking around and we see this little place, like a hole in the wall, like "restaurant" in quotes.

1146
00:51:16,752 --> 00:51:24,889
Rym: So we go in and for 80 cents, we could get like a sausage, egg and cheese and like hash browns and toast and stuff.

1147
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:25,626
Rym: Where was this?

1148
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:26,370
Rym: Yeah.

1149
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:28,090
Rym: So, Scott, there's places like that in America.

1150
00:51:28,171 --> 00:51:29,428
Rym: You forget because you're in New York.

1151
00:51:30,552 --> 00:51:33,510
Rym: There are places in the Bronx where you can get an entire meal for like two bucks.

1152
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:37,430
Scott: But the thing is, it's like, you know, Walmart is really just as low as it goes, right?

1153
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:37,786
Scott: Yeah.

1154
00:51:37,931 --> 00:51:38,408
Rym: You can get it.

1155
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:41,366
Rym: Scott, I think you forget how cheap some food is just because...

1156
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:45,690
Scott: But like rich people also go to Walmart or Amazon or whatever.

1157
00:51:45,832 --> 00:51:47,330
Rym: Yeah, they have they have options.

1158
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:50,770
Rym: They can go really cheap or really expensive anyway.

1159
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:52,110
Scott: But I mean, the difference.

1160
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:55,430
Scott: But I mean, like those prices are ludicrously low, right?

1161
00:51:55,490 --> 00:52:00,530
Scott: Like 80 cents for the bacon, egg and cheese versus like you're talking like one cent.

1162
00:52:00,955 --> 00:52:02,070
Scott: I mean, that's that's crazy.

1163
00:52:02,832 --> 00:52:09,969
Rym: So the interesting thing is I had thousand rupee notes, which I use multiple of when I bought stuff in like the fancy parts of town.

1164
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:17,267
Rym: And people like literally would not have changed for that, for anything I might buy in other parts of town.

1165
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:23,609
Rym: So every denomination, a one rupee coin is actually directly useful and there are things you can buy for one rupee.

1166
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:30,929
Rym: Every denom, every like scale of the money from the from one to a thousand is directly useful all over the place.

1167
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:33,750
Scott: So in one rupee is the lowest, right?

1168
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:34,588
Rym: They don't have pennies.

1169
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:40,310
Rym: Like some people I would tip like five or ten rupees and I would buy like snacks and drinks for like twenty rupees.

1170
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:43,929
Rym: But then I'd have a dinner for like seven thousand rupees.

1171
00:52:44,712 --> 00:52:44,758
Scott: OK.

1172
00:52:45,576 --> 00:52:46,048
Scott: It's like link.

1173
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:47,268
Rym: I actually have.

1174
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:48,890
Scott: Do you have any big shields?

1175
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:52,470
Rym: I actually have about ten thousand rupees with me because I didn't change it back yet.

1176
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:54,250
Scott: Well, you can just change it over like any place.

1177
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:56,609
Rym: Well, I'm waiting because the rupee is actually pretty low right now.

1178
00:52:57,070 --> 00:52:58,070
Rym: So I'm going to hold out.

1179
00:52:58,452 --> 00:52:58,870
Scott: Hold your weight.

1180
00:52:58,970 --> 00:52:59,570
Scott: You're playing the market.

1181
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:00,150
Scott: I'm playing the market.

1182
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:01,750
Scott: You're waiting for the ten thousand rupees.

1183
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:04,830
Rym: Partly because I'll probably go back to India in May or June.

1184
00:53:05,097 --> 00:53:05,327
Scott: Oh, OK.

1185
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:06,590
Rym: Which apparently is the hot season.

1186
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:08,730
Rym: It was like ninety five degrees there while I was there.

1187
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:09,404
Rym: Oh, baby.

1188
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:10,890
Rym: And that's the cold season.

1189
00:53:11,131 --> 00:53:12,889
Scott: Did you see any bicycles that weren't motorized?

1190
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:14,129
Rym: Yes.

1191
00:53:14,311 --> 00:53:15,509
Rym: I saw a lot of mountain bikes.

1192
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:15,903
Rym: OK.

1193
00:53:16,471 --> 00:53:20,269
Rym: I saw one guy on like a road bike, but everyone was riding like mountain bikes.

1194
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:31,169
Rym: But the lens on everyone who was biking, pretty much everyone is riding motorcycles or Vespas or scooters or things like that or little took took like pseudo motorcycle cabs.

1195
00:53:33,412 --> 00:53:35,470
Rym: So Mumbai was awesome, like walking around, though.

1196
00:53:35,791 --> 00:53:42,635
Rym: What's interesting is if you go to the districts where foreigners might go, like in Hyderabad, we went to like a whole bunch of like.

1197
00:53:42,675 --> 00:53:49,830
Rym: I saw Golconda, which is this ancient, like 14th century, 13th century fortified city that is in ruins.

1198
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:52,409
Scott: It was actually, you know, I like the old shit.

1199
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:52,730
Rym: Yeah.

1200
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:53,890
Rym: I got a ton of pictures of that.

1201
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:57,250
Rym: And two of my awesome co-workers like took me around and they were like explaining stuff.

1202
00:53:57,310 --> 00:53:58,229
Rym: We went to all these temples.

1203
00:53:58,652 --> 00:53:59,949
Rym: We did the touristy stuff.

1204
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:05,949
Rym: But because they're locals, like they knew with a worthwhile touristy stuff versus the stuff that's not worth bothering to see.

1205
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:08,750
Rym: So I got a really good and they were explaining stuff.

1206
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:15,027
Rym: And what was interesting is when I was walking around like a shanty town, nobody bothered me at all.

1207
00:54:15,592 --> 00:54:19,770
Rym: Like I wandered into what the average American would probably fear for their lives.

1208
00:54:19,871 --> 00:54:21,989
Rym: But really, everyone was just kind of chill living their lives in there.

1209
00:54:22,636 --> 00:54:23,367
Rym: But no one bothered me.

1210
00:54:24,132 --> 00:54:27,890
Rym: But in the tourist areas where foreigners might go, it's kind of sad.

1211
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:37,110
Rym: But I literally there were beggars like clawing at my clothes and like grabbing me and like demanding money and like putting their hands in my pockets and just like they were pick pockets.

1212
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:37,513
Rym: And it was.

1213
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:38,790
Rym: it was crazy.

1214
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:49,110
Rym: And basically, my two friends, the co-workers followed me around and were like at one point pushing beggars away from me and like shouting people away, like leave him alone.

1215
00:54:49,151 --> 00:54:50,129
Rym: He's not going to give you any money.

1216
00:54:50,672 --> 00:54:51,728
Rym: We're not going to let you rip him off.

1217
00:54:53,232 --> 00:54:55,770
Rym: In Hindi, like there's yelling at these people and I keep them away from me.

1218
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:56,071
Rym: And it was.

1219
00:54:56,553 --> 00:55:00,330
Rym: it was an interesting experience, but it was kind of like scarily stereotypical.

1220
00:55:00,531 --> 00:55:00,854
Rym: Like it's.

1221
00:55:01,236 --> 00:55:03,270
Rym: it's the kind of thing I didn't really expect to happen.

1222
00:55:03,351 --> 00:55:05,629
Rym: And yet it actually happened exactly like it does in the movies.

1223
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:06,150
Scott: Yep.

1224
00:55:07,714 --> 00:55:09,089
Rym: But I got to see like the Gate of India.

1225
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:11,470
Scott: You should watch the relevant Galaxy Express episode.

1226
00:55:12,031 --> 00:55:18,888
Rym: Or the the train station in Mumbai is like from the relevant Galaxy Express episode from the colonial times.

1227
00:55:19,555 --> 00:55:20,485
Rym: It is opulent.

1228
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:24,570
Rym: Like it is as beautiful as Grand Central, but in a very different way.

1229
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:25,770
Scott: Well, the British made it right.

1230
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:31,090
Rym: It is an amazing building, you know, like extra amazing.

1231
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:36,487
Rym: But in the touristy areas, too, and I actually have no problem with this, like a museum I went to.

1232
00:55:37,291 --> 00:55:41,790
Rym: It was five rupees for anyone who was an Indian, a Pakistani.

1233
00:55:42,013 --> 00:55:43,229
Rym: And there's like a list of other countries.

1234
00:55:43,642 --> 00:55:43,810
Scott: Really?

1235
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:44,529
Scott: Even a Pakistani.

1236
00:55:44,971 --> 00:55:45,650
Scott: I thought they hated them.

1237
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:47,630
Rym: No, actually, the average people don't care at all.

1238
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:50,470
Rym: They really wish like they're actually really chill about the Muslims.

1239
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:53,245
Rym: There's a huge Muslim community in India.

1240
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:55,109
Scott: I know that.

1241
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:55,403
Rym: Yeah.

1242
00:55:55,730 --> 00:56:00,069
Rym: But like that slum, like the like the one slum that I saw that the cabbie was talking about.

1243
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:01,729
Rym: Two million people live in that slum.

1244
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:03,469
Rym: And apparently it's like ninety nine percent Muslim.

1245
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:03,918
Scott: OK.

1246
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:04,619
Rym: But.

1247
00:56:07,031 --> 00:56:11,086
Scott: But like that that number of rupees to get into the museum, that's like it might as well be free.

1248
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:14,809
Rym: So it's like five hundred rupees for anyone else.

1249
00:56:15,213 --> 00:56:16,449
Scott: So that's still almost no money.

1250
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:22,166
Rym: So I paid 10 bucks to get in and a poor Indian or a normal Indian can pay five rupees to get in.

1251
00:56:22,290 --> 00:56:23,370
Rym: It's the same as the New York museums.

1252
00:56:23,651 --> 00:56:24,349
Rym: I go in for free.

1253
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:25,530
Scott: Well, I go in for a penny.

1254
00:56:25,812 --> 00:56:26,248
Scott: One penny.

1255
00:56:26,795 --> 00:56:27,210
Scott: One penny.

1256
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:27,784
Scott: You know that guy?

1257
00:56:28,119 --> 00:56:28,268
Scott: Yeah.

1258
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:32,290
Rym: But the you know, the tourists basically pay the tourist tax.

1259
00:56:32,451 --> 00:56:33,688
Rym: I'm OK paying the tourist tax.

1260
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:33,957
Scott: Yeah.

1261
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:37,246
Scott: I mean, like, you know, if I'm in New York and I want to go to the museum, I pay one penny.

1262
00:56:37,691 --> 00:56:45,950
Scott: If I go to some other place and it's not free museum day, I pay the suggested donation, whatever, because I'm not paying for it with taxes.

1263
00:56:46,297 --> 00:56:46,530
Rym: Yeah.

1264
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:47,048
Scott: Right.

1265
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:48,136
Scott: It's not you know, it's not.

1266
00:56:48,176 --> 00:56:49,887
Scott: this is a federal museum like Smithsonian.

1267
00:56:49,907 --> 00:56:50,390
Scott: that are not paying.

1268
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:51,146
Scott: I'm paying the minimum.

1269
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:51,668
Rym: Yeah.

1270
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:57,450
Rym: But like the ruined city was really, really interesting, partly because it wasn't curated in the same way.

1271
00:56:57,450 --> 00:57:00,469
Rym: It's kind of like how everyone says, if you want to see Greek ruins, go to Turkey.

1272
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:06,008
Rym: Because in Greece, they're curated differently and or, you know, the city's kind of built up around it.

1273
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:07,870
Scott: They didn't have like little description plates on it.

1274
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:08,473
Scott: No, it was just.

1275
00:57:08,493 --> 00:57:12,150
Rym: it was just here's a gigantic old ruined city fort.

1276
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:13,650
Rym: Wander around.

1277
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:14,167
Rym: Check it out.

1278
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:18,890
Scott: There aren't like ropes running from touching shit or it's not like don't sit here.

1279
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:21,189
Rym: And I hate to say it.

1280
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:22,488
Scott: But doesn't that make people ruin it?

1281
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:22,868
Scott: No.

1282
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:23,490
Scott: With their touching?

1283
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:24,750
Rym: Well, it kind of does.

1284
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:26,309
Rym: It's getting more ruined as time goes on.

1285
00:57:26,391 --> 00:57:26,788
Scott: Of course.

1286
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:31,110
Rym: But it was actually really cool, like we just kind of wandered around it and like poked into these buildings.

1287
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:33,130
Scott: It's always, you know, it's always like a tough tradeoff.

1288
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:36,370
Scott: It's like you want to preserve this really old thing so more people can enjoy it.

1289
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:42,710
Scott: But you could also give up some of its preservation to have the people who are enjoying it now enjoy it more.

1290
00:57:43,253 --> 00:57:44,149
Rym: I think you have to have a balance.

1291
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:46,950
Scott: It's like, you know, and it seems like, you know, we got two extremes.

1292
00:57:47,132 --> 00:57:48,302
Scott: But it's like, well, what can you do?

1293
00:57:48,363 --> 00:57:49,110
Scott: that would be a balance?

1294
00:57:49,511 --> 00:57:51,241
Scott: It's like, well, some museums in the U.S.

1295
00:57:51,261 --> 00:57:52,830
Scott: were like, OK, don't touch anything.

1296
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:54,949
Scott: Here's one spot we want to let you touch.

1297
00:57:55,431 --> 00:58:02,589
Scott: And it's like, of course, that thing gets touched to death exactly because you get all the touching is concentrated in one area.

1298
00:58:02,897 --> 00:58:03,390
Rym: No touching.

1299
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:12,189
Scott: It's like instead of having the touching spread out over the whole thing, you concentrate in just one area, completely destroying that area 100 percent way faster than any of the other areas.

1300
00:58:12,471 --> 00:58:16,060
Rym: So apparently, Golconda, though, is this huge, like fortified city with a big wall around it.

1301
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:17,589
Scott: I'm sure it has a Wikipedia page.

1302
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:26,764
Rym: Yeah, but the neat things about it were it had this system where you could say things or clap like way down at the gates and you'd hear it all the way up at the top in the throne room.

1303
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:27,455
Scott: Whoa.

1304
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:30,870
Rym: So they could warn like, hey, shit's going down, go hide.

1305
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:31,815
Rym: Whoa.

1306
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:33,749
Rym: Yeah, like really neat stuff like that.

1307
00:58:34,130 --> 00:58:37,545
Scott: Did you go to the throne room and one of your friends stayed at the front and you played a little game?

1308
00:58:38,112 --> 00:58:40,570
Rym: I just went up there and listened to people doing stuff down there.

1309
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:48,050
Rym: We didn't actually play the game because otherwise there were people who were trying to grab us and give a free, like give a tour, like, hey, I'll show you around.

1310
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:50,370
Rym: Then at the end, they were going to demand money and make a big scene.

1311
00:58:50,713 --> 00:58:52,209
Rym: So we had to avoid those people like the plague.

1312
00:58:53,772 --> 00:59:00,970
Rym: And also there was a tunnel, it's gone now, like it collapsed, I think a hundred years ago, between Golconda and Hyderabad, the city itself.

1313
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:02,569
Rym: And apparently you could escape.

1314
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:07,949
Rym: Yeah, the rulers would live in the city, but if shit went down, they'd escape into the tunnel and hide in the fortress.

1315
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:09,210
Scott: Oh, so they didn't live in the fortress.

1316
00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:10,150
Scott: No, they didn't live in the city.

1317
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:10,990
Scott: Because it sucks to live in a fortress.

1318
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,188
Rym: Unless shit went down.

1319
00:59:12,854 --> 00:59:13,990
Scott: Oh, not bad.

1320
00:59:14,290 --> 00:59:14,383
Rym: Yeah.

1321
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:15,506
Rym: There's a lot of neat stuff like that.

1322
00:59:17,673 --> 00:59:20,230
Rym: I think I'm going to kind of cut this short because we've actually gone on a long time.

1323
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:27,830
Rym: I'll share other anecdotes whenever I have time on GeekNights because I haven't even really talked about like 90% of what went on in India.

1324
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:29,109
Scott: It was only there for a week.

1325
00:59:29,631 --> 00:59:34,142
Rym: Yeah, and I did so much in that week that I'm still struggling to like tell the whole story.

1326
00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:38,029
Rym: And I might get to go to Turkey and Germany like right after PAX.

1327
00:59:38,731 --> 00:59:39,510
Scott: I got to go places.

1328
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:42,149
Scott: See, it's like I need vacation so I can go places.

1329
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:45,969
Scott: I want to go places real bad, but you don't have any vacation, but you're just getting business trips.

1330
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:46,470
Scott: That's cheating.

1331
00:59:47,312 --> 00:59:48,428
Rym: So, Scott, you want to come with me?

1332
00:59:49,091 --> 00:59:51,290
Scott: How can I come with you if you had to hire me or something?

1333
00:59:51,290 --> 00:59:52,210
Rym: Yeah, you want to work for my company?

1334
00:59:52,374 --> 00:59:52,545
Scott: No.

1335
00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:53,087
Rym: Why not?

1336
00:59:53,850 --> 00:59:57,083
Scott: All right, if my only job is to travel, then yes, official traveler.

1337
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:01,270
Rym: Your job is going to be writing Java code.

1338
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:05,050
Scott: My job will be the carrier of the corporate card.

1339
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:05,789
Scott: I'll be the wallet.

1340
01:00:06,331 --> 01:00:09,150
Rym: Scott, you're going to be writing complex interfaces in Java.

1341
01:00:09,291 --> 01:00:09,709
Scott: No, I won't.

1342
01:00:10,032 --> 01:00:10,588
Scott: I don't want to do that.

1343
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:12,609
Rym: But then you'll get to go to Java.

1344
01:00:13,031 --> 01:00:13,990
Scott: No, I don't want to do that either.

1345
01:00:14,211 --> 01:00:16,369
Scott: I just want to go to Java without writing any Java.

1346
01:00:17,335 --> 01:00:17,544
Rym: Hah.

1347
01:00:19,054 --> 01:00:19,630
Rym: Pax is coming.

1348
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:20,689
Scott: Yeah, going there.

1349
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,800
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1350
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:33,899
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando Kay for the logos.

1351
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:39,340
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1352
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:42,260
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1353
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:46,460
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1354
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:50,536
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1355
01:00:51,783 --> 01:00:54,840
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1356
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:57,960
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
