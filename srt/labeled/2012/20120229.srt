1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,552
Rym: It's Wednesday, February 29th, 2012.

2
00:00:12,552 --> 00:00:13,014
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,234 --> 00:00:13,776
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,876 --> 00:00:14,960
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,660
Rym: Tonight we talk about Sailor Moon, the Super S movie.

6
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:22,678
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,918
Rym: As opposed to, you know, the Super S show or all the other, anyway.

8
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:32,231
Scott: R, S, Q, P.

9
00:00:32,715 --> 00:00:33,198
Rym: There's no Q.

10
00:00:34,022 --> 00:00:34,819
Scott: Are you sure?

11
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:38,020
Rym: So we got some friends coming out this weekend.

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,896
Rym: It's basically, there may or may not be much GeekNights next week, because I'm flying to India for a week.

13
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:44,686
Rym: Leaving like Saturday.

14
00:00:44,848 --> 00:00:46,500
Rym: And we got some friends coming out right before that.

15
00:00:47,022 --> 00:00:48,399
Scott: Give the great tiger my regards.

16
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,480
Rym: They're coming, of all things, for a yoga tournament.

17
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,360
Rym: And I realize that I cannot conceive...

18
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,129
Scott: Wait, a yoga tournament?

19
00:00:57,209 --> 00:00:59,039
Scott: As in yoga, fire, yoga, flame.

20
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,218
Rym: I'm assuming that this is basically a street fight, because I cannot conceive of any other sort of yoga competition.

21
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:09,260
Scott: I know yoga, and I can respect some kinds of yoga that aren't full of magical bullshit, you know.

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,980
Scott: But it's like, how do you compete at that?

23
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,820
Scott: Is it like, who can stay in the hot room the longest without passing out?

24
00:01:16,281 --> 00:01:17,980
Scott: Is it who can do the hardest position?

25
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:18,733
Scott: It can do...

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,460
Rym: I think it's who can beat the other guy to death with yoga catastrophes first.

27
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,280
Scott: Is it like, who does the positions better?

28
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,240
Scott: You know, is it like with a little score rating system, like figure skating?

29
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:29,648
Scott: Like, oh, 9.8, 9.7, you know?

30
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:33,959
Scott: Is it... Like, how does that freaking work?

31
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,420
Scott: Is it like horse, where it's like, I do a yoga, then you have to do it?

32
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,550
Scott: That'd be a good tournament.

33
00:01:39,631 --> 00:01:40,299
Rym: Actually, you know what?

34
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,619
Scott: Then you do a yoga, then I have to do it?

35
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:48,759
Rym: It's impractical simply for the fact that no one is a video game renaissance man anymore, because there's too many genres.

36
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,560
Rym: I'd love to see you in a megathon around, or a finale that was video game horse.

37
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,940
Rym: Like, each candidate gives them like, here are the 10 horse things I will present to the other person.

38
00:02:00,683 --> 00:02:05,320
Scott: No, pick like 10, or some odd number, 9.

39
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,880
Scott: You know, direct versus 1 versus 1 games that are short.

40
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,620
Scott: And you have to win 5 out of 4 rounds, and it's like, street fighter, go!

41
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,840
Scott: Then it's like, so it's a fighting game, then it's like, you know, some other, you know, racing game, go!

42
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,097
Rym: I was thinking more like, you pick, you know...

43
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,039
Scott: Othello, go!

44
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,360
Rym: Within a constrained set, you're like, alright, you know, just like they do for trick pool tournaments.

45
00:02:27,621 --> 00:02:31,640
Rym: I will beat ball bull with only using jabs.

46
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,298
Rym: Right, jabs.

47
00:02:34,101 --> 00:02:36,899
Rym: And then you do it, and then the other guy has to do the same thing.

48
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:47,780
Scott: The thing is, it was just the person who made the challenge would maybe sometimes fail, you know, and the person who was being challenged would hardly ever be able to succeed.

49
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,620
Rym: Yeah, it works better in trick pool, because there's a very constrained set of pool skills.

50
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,380
Rym: So maybe you set it to like, one game.

51
00:02:55,281 --> 00:02:56,385
Scott: Still, yoga tournament?

52
00:02:56,445 --> 00:02:59,920
Scott: I mean, I could look this up on the internet to figure out how competitive yoga works.

53
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,840
Rym: But I'm just going to assume that it's street fighter.

54
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,699
Scott: But it's much more fun to make fun of it than to look it up.

55
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,179
Scott: Though I probably will look it up when I get home.

56
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,157
Rym: Yoga flame.

57
00:03:09,244 --> 00:03:09,799
Scott: Yoga flame.

58
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,680
Rym: So it's Wednesday, and you know, sadly, a couple of people have pointed out in the forums, we haven't talked about a lot of anime recently.

59
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,800
Scott: There really hasn't been a lot of anime recently.

60
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,900
Rym: Well, there has been, but the last anime I watched was Madoka Magica.

61
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,043
Rym: Yeah.

62
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,659
Rym: The last anime I watched before that, I'm still kind of watching Fist of the North Star, but I'm reading Drops of God.

63
00:03:32,762 --> 00:03:34,720
Rym: I'm playing a lot of video games lately.

64
00:03:35,223 --> 00:03:35,480
Scott: Oh, really?

65
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,420
Rym: It's not anime season.

66
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,820
Scott: No, it really isn't.

67
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:49,000
Scott: Another thing I noticed, right, is that, I've been reading, instead of Anime News Network, the Crunchyroll news, I think has been, you know, mostly the same, but also a little bit better.

68
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:49,287
Scott: Nah.

69
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:49,861
Scott: Right?

70
00:03:50,203 --> 00:03:53,260
Scott: But there was an article on there, this isn't my news, this is just relevant, right?

71
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,140
Scott: This is Japanese fans name the most needed anime sequels, right?

72
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,847
Rym: Wait a minute, wait a minute, I wonder, before you tell me, what- So they had a poll, and it's almost 2,000.

73
00:04:01,847 --> 00:04:05,120
Scott: Japanese fans name the anime series most in need of a sequel.

74
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:12,520
Rym: Because I want to see the same thing in the US, because I, if I had to say something, it's literally Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex is all I want.

75
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:18,120
Rym: Crap, wait a minute, anyway- No, I don't want, I don't actually want more Cowboy Bebop, because I know why.

76
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,959
Scott: But the point is, if you look at this list, it's like, Angel Beats is number one.

77
00:04:22,004 --> 00:04:22,200
Scott: What?

78
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:24,599
Scott: Ha-ru-si-suzumi is two.

79
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,819
Rym: I could see that, I could see that, I could watch more of that.

80
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,509
Scott: Natsume Yuu-jin Show is three.

81
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,300
Scott: Working with an exclamation point is four.

82
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:53,825
Scott: Clannad, After Story, then K-On, then Full Metal Panic, Second Raid, which is a sequel, so I guess they want another sequel, Minami-kei, Squid Girl, Zansayonara Zetsubo Sensei, The World, God Only Knows, My Ordinary Life, Usagi Drop, Sekirei, Rosen Maiden, Genshiken 2, Initial D, Fourth Stage- No, you don't need- Toradora, Okami-san,

83
00:04:54,326 --> 00:04:55,248
Rym: The Strongest

84
00:04:55,348 --> 00:05:02,348
Scott: Disciple, Kenichi, Banner of the Stars 3, Spicenwolf 2, Strike Witches, Elfin'

85
00:05:02,751 --> 00:05:03,558
Rym: Lead,

86
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:03,880
Scott: right?

87
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:12,339
Scott: And it's like, most of the animes, if you look at those JPEGs that show you all the animes coming out, most of them we don't give a shit about.

88
00:05:13,461 --> 00:05:20,542
Scott: All I want, now here's the thing- Madoka 2, I take that, but that isn't on the list, they don't want Madoka 2.

89
00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:22,237
Rym: I wouldn't want Madoka 2 either-.

90
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,983
Rym: Well, here's the thing, I don't want Madoka 2, the same reason I don't want Cowboy Bebop 2.

91
00:05:27,983 --> 00:05:28,941
Scott: I'll take Madoka 2.

92
00:05:28,941 --> 00:05:31,020
Scott: However- More than I'll take Angel Beats 2.

93
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,859
Rym: What did Cowboy Bebop do to get around that?

94
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:36,480
Rym: They set the movie in the middle of the show with no ramifications outside.

95
00:05:37,365 --> 00:05:37,535
Scott: Anyway.

96
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,580
Rym: But if there was a Madoka sequel, I'd actually want it to be a prequel.

97
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,518
Rym: I want to see like, imagine if they did a Madoka OAV or something.

98
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,080
Scott: Well, I mean, I would call the show Magical Homura.

99
00:05:50,602 --> 00:05:53,160
Rym: Well, there's two ways to handle this.

100
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,860
Rym: You go for the fan fulfillment, which is Homura the Badass kicking ass all around the world.

101
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,940
Scott: That's right, the name of the show would be Magical Badass Homura, the end.

102
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:11,440
Rym: But my real serious suggestion would be another show, like 13 episodes, and maybe it's 13 vignettes, maybe a few two-parters in there.

103
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,619
Scott: Well, they wanted to make, you know, Happy School Days Madoka.

104
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,298
Rym: No, don't do that!

105
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:19,020
Scott: That's what they wanted, that's what the guy said he was thinking about making.

106
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,380
Scott: Cause he didn't get enough school days in the regular Madoka.

107
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,738
Rym: That's the worst possible idea.

108
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:26,339
Rym: Short of showing me all the bad endings.

109
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:27,140
Rym: That's right.

110
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:34,540
Rym: But what I would do is, you know, I have a show that's prequels, and every episode is some magical girl from some point in history.

111
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,779
Rym: Because this goes, you know, not to spoil stuff, but I... You just did.

112
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,220
Rym: I spoiled a little bit, I didn't spoil the real spoils.

113
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:47,020
Rym: I want to see like, the Cleopatra magical girl, and the Greek magical girl, and the Indian magical girl.

114
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,600
Scott: Well, you can watch Tezuka's Cleopatra.

115
00:06:48,901 --> 00:06:49,279
Rym: I could.

116
00:06:49,606 --> 00:06:49,880
Scott: Anyway.

117
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,158
Scott: But that's what I would do.

118
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,820
Scott: But the point is, just the reason that there's not so much new animes, is cause the Japanese fans don't like good animes.

119
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,120
Scott: They're making too many Moe shows, not making enough good shows.

120
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,540
Rym: The Japanese fans who care enough to respond to online polls about said thing.

121
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:09,740
Scott: I know, but the point is, it seems like if you look at those JPEGs that say what anime are they coming out, most of them are...

122
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:18,980
Rym: Scott, go to the average American, and do an online poll that only targets people who are super into American comics, and ask them what superhero needs another comic.

123
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,340
Scott: Then explain why most of the animes coming out are targeting this market.

124
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:27,140
Rym: Uh, partly because that is probably a cheap and easy market to target.

125
00:07:27,622 --> 00:07:28,820
Scott: Anyway, you get the idea.

126
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,120
Scott: What new animes are coming out that aren't Moe crap?

127
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,617
Scott: Ghost in the Shell, Stand Alone, Gold Bricks, third gig.

128
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,319
Scott: That's actually coming out.

129
00:07:36,042 --> 00:07:36,438
Rym: It's coming.

130
00:07:38,085 --> 00:07:39,300
Rym: I gotta be optimistic here.

131
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,620
Rym: I'd love to see that survey on American anime fans.

132
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,192
Scott: I would also.

133
00:07:45,274 --> 00:07:45,500
Scott: Anyway.

134
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,519
Scott: So here's some actual news, right?

135
00:07:48,022 --> 00:07:49,299
Scott: And I learned something from this news.

136
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,000
Scott: There are some mangas that have been on hiatus or away for various reasons.

137
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,719
Rym: Like every super long running series that did Mend?

138
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,757
Scott: That they're coming back.

139
00:07:58,562 --> 00:07:59,739
Scott: Bastard is coming back.

140
00:08:00,263 --> 00:08:00,648
Rym: March 19th.

141
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:07,099
Rym: That's bad, because the fact that Bastard was on hiatus meant that there was a chance I could somehow catch up.

142
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,239
Scott: Arakawa, Under the Bridgy Bridge, coming back.

143
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,019
Rym: I kind of want to watch and/or read that.

144
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,240
Scott: Saint Young Men, that's the one with Buddha and Jesus.

145
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,511
Scott: Also coming back.

146
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:15,919
Scott: You know why?

147
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,629
Scott: I didn't know this.

148
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:17,280
Scott: I learned something.

149
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,539
Scott: Arakawa, Under the Bridge, and Saint Young Men.

150
00:08:20,941 --> 00:08:21,588
Scott: Same person.

151
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:22,580
Scott: She was on maternity leave.

152
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:22,943
Scott: What?

153
00:08:23,145 --> 00:08:24,340
Scott: I didn't know that either.

154
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,440
Scott: I didn't know that, but now I do.

155
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:31,840
Scott: And I started reading Saint Young Men on scans because she apparently people have tried to license it and she refuses.

156
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,139
Scott: She doesn't want anyone to put it out in different countries.

157
00:08:34,702 --> 00:08:36,460
Scott: So I've been reading it illegally, whatever.

158
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,019
Scott: I don't care.

159
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:39,700
Scott: And it's kind of awesome.

160
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,740
Scott: It's Buddha and Jesus, their roommates in Japan.

161
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,740
Rym: Emily's got it, because she can read Japanese.

162
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,258
Scott: Yeah, it's coming back.

163
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,039
Scott: Because again, maternity leave, she's done.

164
00:08:48,421 --> 00:08:49,440
Scott: With the babying, right?

165
00:08:49,902 --> 00:08:50,959
Scott: And you know what else is coming back?

166
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,619
Scott: You're not going to believe this one, right?

167
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:55,859
Rym: Elf Princess Rain.

168
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:56,186
Rym: No.

169
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:04,769
Scott: The mystery adventure series Master Keaton ran in big comic original for 18 volumes and now it's returning.

170
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:12,020
Scott: According to the band on volume 8, the series we released Keaton will be returning with Master Keaton remaster set 20 years after the original.

171
00:09:12,604 --> 00:09:12,849
Rym: What?

172
00:09:12,869 --> 00:09:13,278
Rym: Whoa, whoa.

173
00:09:14,006 --> 00:09:14,899
Scott: I want to read this.

174
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,740
Scott: Whether this will be an ongoing or one shot has not been specified.

175
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,286
Rym: Don't care.

176
00:09:18,327 --> 00:09:18,894
Rym: Want to read.

177
00:09:18,914 --> 00:09:19,380
Scott: Won't be in English.

178
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,179
Scott: Well, I mean, I haven't read the irregular mangas.

179
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,260
Rym: Yeah, but I saw the cartoon and that's good enough.

180
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,360
Rym: The problem is, nobody in America likes Master Keaton except us.

181
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,300
Scott: Right, but the thing here, right, is like, okay, so there's some mangas coming back from hiatus.

182
00:09:32,383 --> 00:09:37,779
Scott: This isn't really enough to say there's a trend here, especially since two out of the four are, you know, one person.

183
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,339
Scott: It is if there's no other news.

184
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:49,540
Scott: Right, but I mean, like, is there a trend of like old mangas coming back you know, for a reprise or encore or is or is this just, you know, a coincidence?

185
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:53,560
Scott: okay, these four and it's not really a trend or something that's going to happen a lot.

186
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,680
Rym: I'm going with coincidence and call me back if Ranma starts up again.

187
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:04,207
Scott: Yeah, because I mean, it could be that like, you know, the manga publishers in Japan are like man, these new mangas aren't doing so well.

188
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:12,125
Scott: Let's go and get the creators of the old manga to sort of start them up again and maybe that will sell better to the nostalgia crowd.

189
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:14,812
Scott: You know, that could be a thing that happens.

190
00:10:14,832 --> 00:10:16,106
Scott: I don't know if it's happening right now.

191
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,320
Rym: I'm not sure.

192
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,719
Scott: I don't know either, but it's a possibility.

193
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,670
Rym: Because like, Bastard is a very kind of special odd case.

194
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:24,306
Rym: We could do, we should do a show on Bastard.

195
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:25,659
Scott: We have to watch Bastard again.

196
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,716
Rym: Yeah, I mean, well, we should read some too.

197
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,679
Rym: Oh my god, let's watch Bastard again and do a show on it.

198
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,281
Rym: I haven't seen Bastard since it was like 3 am at RIT.

199
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:35,840
Scott: Have you ever done a show on Gokudo?

200
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,126
Rym: Gokudo?

201
00:10:37,207 --> 00:10:38,806
Rym: I don't think we ever did a show on it.

202
00:10:38,826 --> 00:10:40,199
Rym: We didn't even finish Gokudo.

203
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:40,805
Rym: We should.

204
00:10:40,968 --> 00:10:42,932
Rym: We watched like the first eight episodes.

205
00:10:42,973 --> 00:10:47,880
Scott: It kind of, you know, it started out pretty fun and then it was less fun as he kept going.

206
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,666
Rym: As things go.

207
00:10:48,869 --> 00:10:49,091
Rym: Yeah.

208
00:10:49,657 --> 00:11:00,292
Rym: Anyway, so speaking of reading and watching things illegally, Oricon had a, Oricon Communications had a questionnaire where they asked people stuff about media.

209
00:11:00,313 --> 00:11:11,869
Rym: and supposedly in Japan based on these responses, 28 and a half percent of Japanese middle and high school students have illegally downloaded.

210
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:14,193
Scott: Well, did they, I mean, admitted to legally downloading?

211
00:11:14,214 --> 00:11:14,800
Scott: because it was a survey.

212
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,630
Rym: I point out that I'm really interested in this.

213
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:24,860
Rym: So, alright, 28 percent have ever downloaded anything illegally.

214
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:39,248
Rym: Either that number is completely wrong or Japan is way different from the rest of the world because I think in America the survey answer would actually be like 99 percent.

215
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:39,838
Scott: Yeah.

216
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,460
Scott: Well, I mean, you know, that's a survey.

217
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,792
Scott: There's people admitting to it, right?

218
00:11:43,812 --> 00:11:45,892
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time it's weird because I'll admit to stuff.

219
00:11:45,912 --> 00:11:48,395
Scott: But also you've got to remember how many people are even internet-y, right?

220
00:11:48,435 --> 00:11:53,932
Scott: So it's like all the non-internet-y people are, you know, that's probably more than half right there.

221
00:11:54,316 --> 00:11:56,440
Scott: But a hundred percent of the internet-y people definitely.

222
00:11:57,782 --> 00:12:00,333
Scott: And then there's people who don't realize, you know, so it's...

223
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,236
Rym: Japan's copyright law actually changed and I didn't even know this.

224
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:05,690
Scott: Yeah, they're like arrest people for shit.

225
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,295
Scott: It's crazy.

226
00:12:06,336 --> 00:12:16,275
Rym: No, so they changed the law and apparently it is actually illegal to download copyrighted material, which has never really been proven to be illegal in the US.

227
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:18,900
Rym: Only distribution has been gone after.

228
00:12:19,404 --> 00:12:21,280
Rym: But in Japan they go after consumption.

229
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,083
Rym: Yep.

230
00:12:22,266 --> 00:12:23,100
Rym: Which is interesting.

231
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,404
Scott: Like if you download some, you know, animes in Japan, you could go to jail.

232
00:12:27,424 --> 00:12:31,385
Scott: Like criminal, not they need to sue you, but like the police will just come after you.

233
00:12:31,749 --> 00:12:32,800
Scott: And they're like watching the internet.

234
00:12:33,141 --> 00:12:33,626
Scott: It's crazy.

235
00:12:34,111 --> 00:12:35,808
Rym: But at the same time, they're also really...

236
00:12:35,828 --> 00:12:36,354
Scott: Singapore too.

237
00:12:36,374 --> 00:12:37,909
Scott: Singapore is just as bad in their respect.

238
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:45,475
Rym: Japan's also really down on re-importation, which is, you know, basically legal, and yet undercuts their domestic production almost as much.

239
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:50,064
Rym: No, I would argue it doesn't anymore because hardly anything's getting released in the US.

240
00:12:50,084 --> 00:12:52,690
Scott: Plus remember, this also is only counting teenagers.

241
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:58,872
Scott: So like, are the 30 year olds downloading a lot more than the 20 year olds than the, you know, 13 to 18 year olds?

242
00:12:59,074 --> 00:13:06,992
Rym: I also I really wonder what the actual rates are, because like I said, in America, I think even people like age 30, 40 the rate is like 100%.

243
00:13:06,992 --> 00:13:08,830
Rym: Because one of the first things my parents asked me...

244
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:09,840
Scott: Of internetty people.

245
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,649
Rym: When we got broadband was, so how do I download music?

246
00:13:12,669 --> 00:13:16,771
Scott: Those people at the jury duty who didn't even read a book while they were there and just stared at the TV?

247
00:13:16,973 --> 00:13:19,120
Scott: They're not downloading anything illegally, and they're the majority.

248
00:13:20,024 --> 00:13:25,860
Rym: You know, you say that, but they probably have like an iPod, like an old one or something, and they probably just download stuff.

249
00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:26,347
Scott: Maybe.

250
00:13:26,652 --> 00:13:27,160
Scott: It's possible.

251
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,027
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

252
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:42,593
Rym: So I did not know this existed, and Emily the other day was like, "Hey, this is a

253
00:13:42,653 --> 00:13:42,876
Rym: thing.".

254
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:43,300
Rym: And I was like,

255
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:45,096
Rym: "What?".

256
00:13:45,117 --> 00:14:01,826
Rym: So apparently, when Deke got the rights to Sailor Moon in the US back in the day, one of the options they considered was to not actually release Sailor Moon as it was in Japan, and to just take the characters and make their own show.

257
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:02,694
Scott: Why would you do that?

258
00:14:02,714 --> 00:14:09,320
Scott: It would cost money to make your own show, but if you just take the show that already exists, it doesn't cause nearly as much money to just put it out there.

259
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,129
Rym: Because one, the licensing cost probably would have been less.

260
00:14:12,596 --> 00:14:27,098
Rym: Two, they then would not have had to localize and westernize and dumb down and all the stuff that they ended up having to do with the Sailor Moon because they wanted to pretend it wasn't in Japan, and pretend that it wasn't actually, you know, a show for slightly older girls.

261
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,057
Scott: Why didn't they just let it be in Japan?

262
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,179
Rym: Scott, you really, really asked that.

263
00:14:32,468 --> 00:14:33,540
Rym: That's how people have been.

264
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:43,300
Rym: So anyway, not only were they going to remake it and reanimate it, but they were only going to reanimate half of it, because the other half was live action.

265
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,733
Scott: Well, that was the trend in those days, right?

266
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:52,350
Scott: You could save a lot of money by making a show, you know, partially live action in a lot of these cheap filler scenes, and then using other stuff for the rest.

267
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,680
Rym: Like, Power Rangers.

268
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,832
Scott: Power Rangers in the US.

269
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,826
Scott: You have some English US actors act out these in-between scenes.

270
00:14:57,866 --> 00:15:00,068
Rym: And then an unrelated Sentai show.

271
00:15:00,088 --> 00:15:03,825
Scott: Then you just dub over this other Sentai show for the fighting monster scenes.

272
00:15:04,007 --> 00:15:06,999
Scott: Or, you know, a lot of VR Troopers, same kind of thing.

273
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,112
Scott: Superhuman Samurai, Cyber Squad, same thing.

274
00:15:10,133 --> 00:15:26,399
Rym: So, what's amazing is that in 1995 at Anime Expo, that's before I knew anime cons existed, someone showed the only screening I have ever been able to find.

275
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,900
Scott: The thing I don't understand is why would you show this to anime fans at Anime Expo?

276
00:15:30,984 --> 00:15:32,176
Rym: I think the reason is apparent.

277
00:15:32,196 --> 00:15:35,470
Rym: The audience is dumbstruck by this thing.

278
00:15:36,055 --> 00:15:37,066
Rym: It's pretty amazing.

279
00:15:37,106 --> 00:15:40,117
Rym: So, bonus points about this are that 1.

280
00:15:40,117 --> 00:15:48,040
Rym: Sailor Moon is also in a wheelchair, and the cast is diverse to a degree that would make Captain Planet cringe at the political correctness.

281
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:54,639
Rym: But she can walk around just fine in the animated part, but she has a wheelchair mech in that part.

282
00:15:55,624 --> 00:16:01,979
Rym: And I think the icing on the cake is that they made them literal sailors sailing things through space.

283
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:02,722
Scott: Right.

284
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,198
Scott: Well, because kids wouldn't understand.

285
00:16:04,238 --> 00:16:05,247
Scott: Like, "She's called Sailor Moon.

286
00:16:05,267 --> 00:16:05,953
Scott: How come she doesn't have a

287
00:16:05,993 --> 00:16:06,195
Scott: boat?".

288
00:16:07,802 --> 00:16:10,011
Rym: It's... This is pretty dangerous.

289
00:16:10,072 --> 00:16:11,626
Rym: This is anime hell territory.

290
00:16:11,687 --> 00:16:16,254
Scott: Yeah, I'm pretty sure this has already been in anime hell, and we just weren't at that anime hell.

291
00:16:16,294 --> 00:16:19,769
Rym: Yeah, the number of views on this video is pretty low, so, uh...

292
00:16:19,931 --> 00:16:22,032
Scott: There might have been other times posted to YouTube.

293
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:23,485
Rym: I want to get the word out.

294
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:28,939
Rym: I want people to, uh, know that this is a thing, and that it is perhaps one of the worst things the world has ever seen.

295
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:29,261
Rym: Mm-hmm.

296
00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:32,112
Scott: So, my thing of the day is the best, right?

297
00:16:32,152 --> 00:16:35,585
Scott: For many years, I have been looking for things like this, right?

298
00:16:36,151 --> 00:16:42,720
Scott: And it has been hard to find things like this, which is something that was originally English, but was dubbed in some other country.

299
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,600
Scott: Because other countries tend to just sort of subtitle.

300
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,241
Scott: True.

301
00:16:45,281 --> 00:16:49,669
Scott: And you only get the weird... And a lot of times, you get stuff like Turkish Star Wars, where it isn't even a dub.

302
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:52,233
Scott: It's just, like, some, you know, remake rip-off thing, right?

303
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:58,240
Scott: And, you know, it's kind of hard to find dubs of stuff from the US that is in other languages.

304
00:16:59,383 --> 00:17:01,991
Scott: Uh, and at least, you know, even if you do find dubs, they're not that interesting.

305
00:17:02,011 --> 00:17:04,898
Scott: Like, I watched Spanish ET once in high school and Spanish class.

306
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:05,925
Scott: Or, like, the Lion King.

307
00:17:05,946 --> 00:17:06,900
Scott: Oh, it's middle school, not high school.

308
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,172
Rym: I watched the Lion King in French.

309
00:17:08,232 --> 00:17:09,895
Rym: It's just perfect and in French.

310
00:17:10,037 --> 00:17:10,180
Scott: Yeah.

311
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:13,191
Scott: Right?

312
00:17:13,453 --> 00:17:14,901
Scott: You know, but, I mean, there's nothing funny about that.

313
00:17:14,921 --> 00:17:16,239
Scott: There's nothing good to go with, right?

314
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,709
Scott: So, here is, right, thanks to, I guess, I assume Patrick Massey is Crunchyroll News, right?

315
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:24,339
Scott: It was actually in a link to something from another story.

316
00:17:25,402 --> 00:17:28,173
Scott: This is the Japanese dub of Star Wars, right?

317
00:17:28,252 --> 00:17:30,395
Scott: Which is actually really good.

318
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:33,202
Scott: Like, you're watching it and you're like, "Damn, that is some good dubbing right

319
00:17:33,222 --> 00:17:33,505
Scott: there.".

320
00:17:34,252 --> 00:17:37,809
Scott: But, specifically, this video isn't just the Japanese dub of Star Wars.

321
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:43,831
Scott: It's specifically all 11 minutes and 18 seconds of Lando Calrissian screen time.

322
00:17:43,851 --> 00:17:44,359
Scott: Uh-oh.

323
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:48,456
Scott: In the, uh, you know, Japanese Star Wars.

324
00:17:48,517 --> 00:17:51,407
Scott: It's just all of Lando's screen time cut up out of the movies.

325
00:17:51,427 --> 00:17:52,700
Rym: It's got the danger alert.

326
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,829
Rym: Something that hasn't gone off many times in my life is going out.

327
00:17:56,254 --> 00:17:58,940
Rym: This is, this is edging into most territory right here.

328
00:17:59,142 --> 00:17:59,425
Scott: Right.

329
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:05,890
Scott: And, you know, so it's pretty much, you're watching all of Star Wars but only the Lando Calrissian parts in the Japanese dub.

330
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,439
Scott: There's no other modifications to this video whatsoever.

331
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:12,014
Rym: So, is the moral of this, that there are two options.

332
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:21,687
Rym: Either Japan found someone amazing to do that voice, or they actually did a good job with a black man's voice in Japanese.

333
00:18:22,232 --> 00:18:22,535
Scott: Okay.

334
00:18:22,777 --> 00:18:26,617
Scott: So, uh, first of all, the dub is amazing overall.

335
00:18:26,718 --> 00:18:27,506
Scott: Like, just watching it.

336
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:28,131
Scott: Like, oh, Leia.

337
00:18:28,212 --> 00:18:31,243
Scott: Oh, and the C-3PO voice, and the Darth Vader voice is pretty good.

338
00:18:31,324 --> 00:18:31,788
Rym: Overall.

339
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,759
Scott: Can you, can you guess at the reason that it is a Lando Calrissian?

340
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:41,076
Rym: Ah, all the Japanese are stupid.

341
00:18:41,218 --> 00:18:41,985
Rym: I hate all Japanese.

342
00:18:42,025 --> 00:18:43,317
Rym: Is it one of those situations?

343
00:18:43,963 --> 00:18:50,456
Scott: The voice of Lando Calrissian in Japanese Star Wars is it?

344
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,116
Scott: Oh my God, it really is.

345
00:18:53,136 --> 00:18:58,836
Scott: It absolutely is.

346
00:18:59,058 --> 00:18:59,866
Rym: Oh my God.

347
00:18:59,886 --> 00:19:01,138
Scott: It is amazing.

348
00:19:01,198 --> 00:19:02,350
Scott: So, is the greatest.

349
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,809
Rym: So, he is now actually my favorite voice actor.

350
00:19:06,272 --> 00:19:07,602
Rym: My second favorite voice actor.

351
00:19:07,884 --> 00:19:15,789
Scott: He is like Because it's pretty much uh, Koyasu, him, and uh, Akira Kamiya.

352
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:21,706
Scott: He doesn't talk to Yoda ever.

353
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:22,030
Scott: I know.

354
00:19:22,732 --> 00:19:23,722
Scott: He doesn't even see Yoda.

355
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:24,949
Scott: Yoda's only ever talks to Luke.

356
00:19:27,114 --> 00:19:28,029
Rym: That's some good stuff.

357
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:32,430
Scott: But yes, Norio Wakamoto is the voice of Lando Calrissian in Japan.

358
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,358
Scott: Does a great job.

359
00:19:33,722 --> 00:19:34,489
Rym: Oh my gosh.

360
00:19:35,152 --> 00:19:35,700
Scott: It's amazing.

361
00:19:35,964 --> 00:19:39,321
Rym: So, in the meta moment, Easter weekend, which is coming up pretty soon.

362
00:19:39,341 --> 00:19:42,026
Rym: We will be at the Pinair Gate Expo doing one lecture.

363
00:19:42,046 --> 00:19:43,784
Rym: Let's play a money making game.

364
00:19:44,147 --> 00:19:45,239
Scott: We will all be doing one.

365
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:46,310
Scott: Ten, thirty, fifty.

366
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:53,399
Rym: We will be doing one two hour classroom workshop on how to play some German style board games.

367
00:19:53,864 --> 00:19:54,390
Scott: Ah, yeah.

368
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:58,070
Rym: And we will be at Anime Boston doing diamonds in the rough.

369
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,277
Scott: And eating dinner.

370
00:19:59,802 --> 00:20:03,909
Rym: We will also be at the going cardboard uh, screening where we will say hi.

371
00:20:05,196 --> 00:20:05,236
Rym: Hi.

372
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:07,337
Rym: To people who want to say hi to us.

373
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:07,842
Scott: Great.

374
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:11,588
Rym: Otherwise, we're pretty much going to be in tabletop playing games the entire time.

375
00:20:12,573 --> 00:20:14,250
Scott: Except for like an hour in the expo hall or something.

376
00:20:14,552 --> 00:20:16,050
Rym: And an hour or so at the Whiskey Priest.

377
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:17,750
Rym: And the illegal test kitchen.

378
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:18,413
Scott: Yep.

379
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:20,677
Scott: Other meta things.

380
00:20:20,718 --> 00:20:21,829
Scott: Do we have a new book club book?

381
00:20:22,312 --> 00:20:22,979
Rym: Uh, yes we do.

382
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,285
Rym: But I'll announce that in the separate book club episode.

383
00:20:25,407 --> 00:20:25,609
Scott: Okay.

384
00:20:26,832 --> 00:20:28,190
Scott: Do we have internets?

385
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:28,655
Scott: We do.

386
00:20:28,756 --> 00:20:30,070
Scott: You should visit us on the internets.

387
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,938
Scott: A lot of people, they subscribe to this show on iTunes or something.

388
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:34,330
Scott: They listen to it maybe.

389
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,837
Scott: But they never visit us on the internets.

390
00:20:36,877 --> 00:20:37,929
Scott: Well, we have internets.

391
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,086
Scott: You should go to twitter.com/geeknights.

392
00:20:40,957 --> 00:20:43,836
Scott: You should go to Google Plus GeekNights, Facebook dot.

393
00:20:43,856 --> 00:20:45,756
Scott: com slash forum dot.

394
00:20:45,776 --> 00:20:46,562
Rym: front row crew dot.

395
00:20:46,603 --> 00:20:46,825
Rym: com.

396
00:20:46,885 --> 00:20:48,360
Rym: Our forum's pretty fucking rocking.

397
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:49,776
Scott: You can also go to just front row crew dot.

398
00:20:49,796 --> 00:20:50,119
Scott: com.

399
00:20:50,139 --> 00:20:51,997
Scott: You can go to all kinds of places.

400
00:20:52,058 --> 00:20:54,584
Scott: Just search for Front Row Crew or GeekNights on the Google.

401
00:20:54,948 --> 00:20:58,749
Scott: Whatever part of the internets you like to use, you can find us there.

402
00:20:59,212 --> 00:21:02,542
Scott: And hook up with us and you will be well notified.

403
00:21:02,603 --> 00:21:09,613
Rym: In particular, the GeekNights Rym YouTube channel, our official YouTube channel, has many of our panels and lectures throughout the recent years.

404
00:21:09,815 --> 00:21:15,833
Rym: And I just uploaded a new video that if you weren't already going out of your mind waiting for PAX, this video is probably...

405
00:21:15,853 --> 00:21:19,530
Scott: You know how many, there's only like 36 37 days till PAX East.

406
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,296
Rym: It's coming.

407
00:21:20,498 --> 00:21:21,308
Scott: It's real close.

408
00:21:21,348 --> 00:21:22,341
Scott: I gotta get that panel together.

409
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:22,970
Scott: I'm gonna do it this week.

410
00:21:23,332 --> 00:21:24,159
Scott: I'm doing it this week.

411
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,430
Rym: I gotta get all the other panels together.

412
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,600
Scott: I'm doing it this weekend.

413
00:21:26,621 --> 00:21:28,055
Scott: I'm putting together the money making game.

414
00:21:28,075 --> 00:21:29,775
Scott: I know what the first slide is.

415
00:21:32,154 --> 00:21:32,729
Rym: Old man.

416
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:39,812
Scott: Oh man, why you give me useless hint for 50?

417
00:21:39,812 --> 00:21:43,880
Rym: So... So the other day, a conversation that I never thought would happen happened.

418
00:21:43,921 --> 00:21:48,408
Rym: Scott comes to me and says, "Hey, we should do a show on Sailor

419
00:21:48,448 --> 00:21:48,630
Rym: Moon.".

420
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:51,336
Scott: Well, the thing is, Rym is the biggest Sailor Moon nut there is.

421
00:21:51,396 --> 00:21:52,830
Rym: No, that is not true.

422
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:53,880
Scott: He's a huge Sailor Moon nut.

423
00:21:53,941 --> 00:21:55,719
Rym: I am not actually a big fan of Sailor Moon.

424
00:21:55,739 --> 00:21:57,315
Scott: Yes, you are a gigantic fan of Sailor Moon.

425
00:21:57,497 --> 00:22:01,378
Scott: And it's a very important anime in the US especially.

426
00:22:01,398 --> 00:22:05,820
Scott: And we'd never done a show on it and we really needed some anime shows.

427
00:22:06,103 --> 00:22:09,717
Scott: So I'm like, "Hey, that's a good show to do an episode on.

428
00:22:09,737 --> 00:22:12,954
Scott: Let's watch some kind of Sailor Moon something.

429
00:22:13,014 --> 00:22:14,809
Scott: Since you're such a big fan, you know what to watch.

430
00:22:15,551 --> 00:22:17,497
Scott: Let's watch something and then do an episode on

431
00:22:17,537 --> 00:22:17,578
Scott: it.".

432
00:22:18,163 --> 00:22:22,427
Rym: Back in the day, I watched Vampire 100D when I was in fourth grade.

433
00:22:22,487 --> 00:22:23,781
Rym: My little brother was in second grade.

434
00:22:24,286 --> 00:22:25,013
Rym: And it was a big deal.

435
00:22:25,074 --> 00:22:26,004
Rym: And I really got into anime.

436
00:22:26,024 --> 00:22:28,005
Rym: And I watched all the anime Blockbuster.

437
00:22:28,025 --> 00:22:28,450
Rym: And then what?

438
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,960
Rym: Like, then what do I do?

439
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:30,690
Rym: Go to Suncoast?

440
00:22:31,052 --> 00:22:32,530
Rym: There's like four more shows to watch.

441
00:22:32,712 --> 00:22:33,463
Rym: Now I've seen all that.

442
00:22:33,483 --> 00:22:33,929
Rym: Now what?

443
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:37,537
Rym: So I eventually found fan subs.

444
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:44,830
Rym: And the first fan sub I ever got, I actually got tapes mailed to me of all of Sailor Moon.

445
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,119
Scott: A big show.

446
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:49,113
Scott: Every letter like regular Sailor Moon, S, R, Q, P, T.

447
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:55,055
Rym: I have VHS's made from the original laserdisc releases with English subtitles.

448
00:22:55,075 --> 00:22:58,270
Scott: Of every single episode, OAV and movie of Sailor Moon ever?

449
00:22:58,853 --> 00:22:59,277
Rym: In order?

450
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:06,670
Rym: Every bit of animation ever related to Sailor Moon directly is in fact on VHS format in boxes somewhere.

451
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:07,636
Scott: In your possession?

452
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:13,655
Rym: And the cases themselves had color print out scans of the laserdisc covers.

453
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,438
Rym: They are super pro.

454
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:20,869
Scott: Is this in, you know, you watch including the movie we just watched is also in there?

455
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:21,475
Rym: Uh, yes.

456
00:23:21,718 --> 00:23:24,710
Rym: All three movies plus the special Ami-chan the Hopsicle.

457
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,330
Scott: How much did this cost you in those days?

458
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:26,850
Scott: $240.

459
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:27,821
Rym: That's pretty cheap.

460
00:23:28,831 --> 00:23:32,109
Rym: For shipping and the cost of the tapes because I had to buy all the tapes.

461
00:23:32,931 --> 00:23:37,922
Rym: Now I could have had him ship me SVHS's which would have been higher quality, but...

462
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,214
Scott: You need an SVHS player.

463
00:23:39,396 --> 00:23:40,750
Rym: I had an SVHS player.

464
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:41,842
Rym: Whoa!

465
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:48,130
Rym: I was not confident I would have another one ever, nor was I confident that anyone would let me take that thing to college.

466
00:23:49,131 --> 00:23:50,390
Rym: I don't even know where it is anymore.

467
00:23:51,011 --> 00:23:51,596
Scott: I don't know either.

468
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,949
Scott: We had it in Beacon I think.

469
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,350
Rym: Uh, yeah we did but it didn't work that well.

470
00:23:56,612 --> 00:24:00,550
Rym: Remember we also had that ghetto DVD player that we had to take the case off or it would overheat?

471
00:24:01,153 --> 00:24:04,249
Rym: That we hacked to be region free and then never played a single region free disc ever?

472
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:09,368
Scott: Yeah, well because we had Video Barn which had broken with the discs were hacked so it didn't matter.

473
00:24:10,553 --> 00:24:11,483
Rym: So Scott was like, "What should I

474
00:24:11,524 --> 00:24:11,847
Rym: watch?".

475
00:24:12,393 --> 00:24:23,670
Rym: and after a long sort of explanation of Sailor Moon R, S, Super S, stars, manga, movies I realized that there's no way I'll ever get Scott to watch all of Sailor Moon.

476
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:24,766
Scott: Yeah, no kidding.

477
00:24:25,993 --> 00:24:35,609
Rym: And the thing is I'd love to get him to watch enough to do a show on Sailor Moon the way we did on Slayers but it's not going to happen anytime soon.

478
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,123
Rym: It's too much.

479
00:24:37,224 --> 00:24:38,396
Rym: It's only 200 episodes.

480
00:24:38,881 --> 00:24:39,930
Scott: Oh, only 200.

481
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,650
Scott: It's only more than Fist of the North Star.

482
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:42,808
Rym: That's all.

483
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:47,550
Rym: So rather than explain it or anything I figured let's just pick a movie.

484
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:51,229
Rym: So I took the three movies and I didn't really explain what they were.

485
00:24:51,512 --> 00:24:53,150
Rym: I just offered Scott the following choice.

486
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:57,089
Rym: Do you want to watch the movie about the gay guy from space who comes down and fucks shit up?

487
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:58,641
Rym: The movie about candy?

488
00:24:58,661 --> 00:25:01,110
Rym: Or the movie that's actually about the cat and the moon?

489
00:25:01,591 --> 00:25:02,970
Scott: Well, I don't care about the cat and the moon.

490
00:25:03,531 --> 00:25:04,643
Rym: That's actually the best one.

491
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,481
Scott: Well the other one sounds crazy, right?

492
00:25:06,521 --> 00:25:08,016
Scott: So it's got to be one of the crazy ones.

493
00:25:08,036 --> 00:25:08,542
Scott: Right?

494
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,106
Scott: So, I don't know.

495
00:25:11,126 --> 00:25:12,238
Scott: We ended up with the candy one.

496
00:25:12,642 --> 00:25:13,896
Scott: But it wasn't about candy.

497
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:14,990
Scott: It was about Pedobear.

498
00:25:15,711 --> 00:25:16,830
Rym: No, it was about the Pedo Piper.

499
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,341
Scott: It was about Pedobear.

500
00:25:18,744 --> 00:25:20,784
Rym: We're going to spoil the Sailor Moon Super-S movie.

501
00:25:20,824 --> 00:25:23,608
Rym: You don't really You don't give a shit about that.

502
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,368
Rym: You should probably watch the movie.

503
00:25:26,757 --> 00:25:27,753
Scott: No, you probably shouldn't.

504
00:25:28,258 --> 00:25:35,552
Rym: So I learned some stuff about this movie because when I watched Sailor Moon you know, Young and Innocent I did not know yet who Kunihiko Ikuhara was.

505
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:42,346
Rym: Ikuhara, you know, Utena Craziness Pedophile.

506
00:25:43,614 --> 00:25:44,280
Rym: Not a pedophile.

507
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,019
Rym: More of a hebophile as far as we can tell.

508
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,730
Rym: He would at least.

509
00:25:46,893 --> 00:25:47,850
Scott: Oh, because that's so much better.

510
00:25:48,472 --> 00:25:50,390
Rym: Yeah, it's arguably a little bit better.

511
00:25:50,892 --> 00:25:51,215
Scott: Oh, okay.

512
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,722
Rym: I'm not going to impinge upon his character because some of it's second hand.

513
00:25:56,025 --> 00:25:58,730
Rym: Some of it's just obvious from listening to him in interviews.

514
00:25:59,555 --> 00:26:03,909
Rym: He's an odd dude but he caused Utena to be made so I got to give him some respect.

515
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:07,870
Rym: But he was, you know, also deeply involved in Sailor Moon.

516
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:22,409
Rym: And apparently the Sailor Moon Super-S movie was originally going to be primarily about sailors Uranus and Neptune and have a basically totally different plot all about them.

517
00:26:23,496 --> 00:26:26,269
Rym: And he left the series before that got made.

518
00:26:26,593 --> 00:26:27,828
Rym: so they just dropped it all.

519
00:26:28,911 --> 00:26:30,974
Rym: So this was not the movie that could've been.

520
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:37,648
Rym: I'm almost sad about that because Uranus and Neptune are pretty much the best characters in the show.

521
00:26:39,953 --> 00:26:41,238
Rym: Let's talk about this movie.

522
00:26:41,258 --> 00:26:42,330
Scott: So here's how this movie goes.

523
00:26:42,633 --> 00:26:55,630
Scott: So you're sitting in this town, happy town, and suddenly this is, you know, Pied Piper but he's a Pied Piper of children bringing the children into his magical flying boat with promises of candy.

524
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:57,845
Scott: Pedo bear, pedo bear, pedo bear.

525
00:26:57,906 --> 00:26:59,829
Scott: How can you not see the pedo?

526
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,729
Scott: He brings a whole town's full of children into his flying candy arc.

527
00:27:04,671 --> 00:27:05,359
Scott: Oh my god.

528
00:27:05,379 --> 00:27:07,118
Scott: That's really what the movie's about.

529
00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:08,189
Scott: That's the central plot.

530
00:27:09,635 --> 00:27:12,916
Scott: Of course, Sailor Moon and friends wake up to try and fight this shit.

531
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:14,916
Scott: Well, not originally.

532
00:27:15,017 --> 00:27:16,249
Rym: A whole bunch of kids get abducted.

533
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:17,541
Scott: Well, in all their towns.

534
00:27:17,561 --> 00:27:18,409
Scott: Yeah, all over the world.

535
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:19,762
Scott: Like, thousands of kids.

536
00:27:19,802 --> 00:27:22,774
Scott: That's until they try to kidnap from the sailor town where the sailors live.

537
00:27:23,218 --> 00:27:24,107
Rym: So immediately I realized...

538
00:27:24,127 --> 00:27:27,744
Scott: The thing is, if they're supposed to be protecting the whole solar system they can't even protect...

539
00:27:27,785 --> 00:27:28,290
Rym: No, no they're not.

540
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:31,560
Scott: They can't even protect the other towns on Earth.

541
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,215
Scott: They can only protect their own town.

542
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:34,649
Scott: What the fuck is up with that?

543
00:27:35,171 --> 00:27:40,229
Rym: Shortly in the movie, the first thing Scott asked me is, "How come none of these Sailor Scouts are competent at all?

544
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,097
Rym: Are any of them

545
00:27:41,238 --> 00:27:41,602
Rym: smart?".

546
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,266
Rym: And that's pretty much when the Outer Senshi...

547
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:50,996
Scott: Even the computery one with the cool goggles and stuff was stupid.

548
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:59,259
Scott: It's like, they're sitting there, there's a bad guy and they're yelling at him and saying stuff and they're fighting the same minions over and over again.

549
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,976
Scott: And I'm like, "Just use all of your Sailor magical attacks at

550
00:28:03,158 --> 00:28:03,300
Scott: once!".

551
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:06,716
Rym: But Scott, it is the deepest insult to Japanese culture.

552
00:28:06,776 --> 00:28:11,280
Rym: you could ever have to use your full power immediately or at any point until the last possible second.

553
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:15,988
Scott: You obviously need to use your full power because children are getting abducted probably for raping.

554
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:18,290
Rym: I love how they don't even put much of an effort.

555
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:25,608
Rym: They see these massive kids walking toward this scary ark and they kind of stand in front of the kids like, "Hey, eh, don't go.

556
00:28:26,131 --> 00:28:26,901
Rym: Eh, fuck it, let him

557
00:28:26,942 --> 00:28:27,104
Rym: go.".

558
00:28:28,094 --> 00:28:30,270
Scott: Not really all that much happens in this movie.

559
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:40,998
Scott: It's really, the amount of stuff that happens in this movie is about the same amount of stuff that would happen in a TV episode is just sort of dragged out with like, the pace is kind of slow.

560
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:42,473
Rym: Welcome to the Sailor Moon movies.

561
00:28:42,493 --> 00:28:50,899
Scott: There's a lot of useless talking that doesn't advance the plot and a lot of scenes where it's like, there'll be these blue bad guys falling down at them and they'll attack them and it'll work.

562
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,930
Rym: Apparently those blue candy bomb bomb bomb babies!

563
00:28:54,230 --> 00:29:02,067
Scott: Yeah, the bomb bomb babies will attack, they'll fight them off and then more will come and they'll fight them off and they'll kill like ten minutes just fighting bomb bomb babies.

564
00:29:02,775 --> 00:29:03,890
Scott: eh, you know, fruitlessly.

565
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:12,630
Rym: Which apparently in this intergalactic like, fairy space civilization bomb bomb babies are actually the only weapon they have.

566
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:13,294
Scott: Yeah.

567
00:29:13,436 --> 00:29:17,339
Rym: I mean even the cannon seems to shoot like, weaponized bomb bomb babies.

568
00:29:17,824 --> 00:29:18,450
Scott: It's very strange.

569
00:29:19,372 --> 00:29:25,399
Rym: I do also like how the intersenshi, the main Sailor Scouts pretty much fall for any trick.

570
00:29:25,904 --> 00:29:32,875
Scott: Yeah, they're just dumb, they don't... They're fighting a candy monster that tricked children with promises of candy and then they got a scary ride boat.

571
00:29:32,915 --> 00:29:36,329
Scott: And then the guy uses gingerbread house to fool them and it kinda works.

572
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:44,130
Rym: They're like, we're gonna stop you from tricking people with candy, oh hey look a gingerbread house, hey how come we're all babies now, who the fuck cares, candy!

573
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:48,630
Scott: It's like, oh my god you have magical attacking powers.

574
00:29:49,156 --> 00:29:58,410
Scott: you just fucking transformed in a crazy transforming scene, use your super magical attack and defeat the bad guy, no we're just gonna stand here and get hit by bomb bomb babies.

575
00:29:58,471 --> 00:30:12,550
Rym: What was more interesting is Chibi-Usa, you know the pink one, the little girl, is you know, she has this whole like, mechanon like childish, innocent romance with petal du du du, who's I guess the main good side character.

576
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:16,852
Scott: Right, there's like, you know, there's the three petal kidnappers, but then there's one person who's...

577
00:30:16,872 --> 00:30:18,330
Rym: Well, the petal kidnappers.

578
00:30:18,835 --> 00:30:21,055
Rym: one of them, Populin, is kinda normal.

579
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,461
Scott: Then there's like these two other ones that appear...

580
00:30:23,502 --> 00:30:24,513
Rym: Banana and Orangin?

581
00:30:24,574 --> 00:30:28,109
Scott: Banana and Orangin, which I looked at and I was like, oh my god, banana guy and orange guy.

582
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:28,735
Scott: oh my god.

583
00:30:28,917 --> 00:30:29,563
Rym: I like the orange guy a lot.

584
00:30:29,584 --> 00:30:30,999
Scott: They're in the movie for like a minute.

585
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,030
Scott: They're hilarious though.

586
00:30:32,471 --> 00:30:37,824
Scott: They don't really say anything too much but they appear, and it's like, oh my god They pretty much go down like jumps.

587
00:30:37,864 --> 00:30:38,429
Rym: They're hilarious.

588
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,048
Rym: Oh, don't forget Queen Badine.

589
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:46,430
Scott: Right, so that's basically it, the chief pedophile who is like, you know, cause there always has to be a square boss behind the regular bad guy.

590
00:30:46,591 --> 00:30:47,239
Rym: Of course.

591
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:47,643
Scott: Right.

592
00:30:48,068 --> 00:30:56,370
Rym: But you know, the pink haired one is kind of like like it's obvious she has this weird crush on, you know, Mamoru, sailor not sailor, Tuxedo Mask.

593
00:30:57,116 --> 00:30:58,549
Rym: I keep, I always wanted like.

594
00:30:58,973 --> 00:31:01,580
Rym: I'm never sure if I should say the English name or the Japanese, whatever.

595
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,189
Rym: And Scott points that out.

596
00:31:04,855 --> 00:31:20,024
Rym: and then I realize suddenly something that I never noticed when I watched the show the first time how fucked up that is because Scott was bothered by it not knowing that that girl is actually his daughter from the future and everyone involved knows that.

597
00:31:20,105 --> 00:31:24,082
Scott: I mean the fact that that's even what this plot is, is crazy.

598
00:31:24,102 --> 00:31:25,920
Scott: That's like something fans would come up in a fanfiction.

599
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,850
Scott: I know it's amazing Scott.

600
00:31:27,092 --> 00:31:35,638
Scott: The fact that that little chibi thing even exists is like she's totally seems like the kind of thing that would only exist in fanfiction and would never actually be in a show.

601
00:31:35,658 --> 00:31:47,559
Scott: So it's like maybe that's actually sort of in some ways that and maybe other shows that have similar things are responsible maybe for the crazy shit in fanfiction because sometimes that shit happens in the actual canon.

602
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:48,488
Scott: It's like are you kidding me?

603
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:49,816
Rym: Are you kidding me?

604
00:31:49,837 --> 00:31:50,945
Scott: This taught me something.

605
00:31:52,292 --> 00:31:59,175
Scott: There's some tiny Sailor Moon with pink hair from the future who's like three years old and is the daughter of Sailor Moon.

606
00:31:59,195 --> 00:32:00,470
Rym: She's like six or seven or eight.

607
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,440
Scott: Fine, she's six, seven or eight.

608
00:32:01,561 --> 00:32:05,950
Scott: She's from the Sailor Moon's daughter from the future who went back in time.

609
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:09,721
Rym: The one who's three is called Chibi Chibi and is even smaller.

610
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:10,790
Scott: That's double fanfiction.

611
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,810
Rym: But no, she's actually the goddess of the universe.

612
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,190
Rym: Spoilers I guess.

613
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,209
Scott: That is fucked up shit right there.

614
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:17,810
Scott: That is fanfiction.

615
00:32:18,011 --> 00:32:18,860
Scott: Oh my god.

616
00:32:19,082 --> 00:32:25,145
Rym: What I realized and this is like a revelation because I happen to have seen all of Sailor Moon from an earlier Desperate Arrow.

617
00:32:25,165 --> 00:32:26,661
Scott: You just happened to have seen it.

618
00:32:26,883 --> 00:32:27,328
Scott: You didn't.

619
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:30,089
Scott: You went out of your way to see.

620
00:32:30,129 --> 00:32:30,789
Scott: it is the truth.

621
00:32:31,911 --> 00:32:34,456
Scott: It's not like you were sitting in a room and it just happened to be gone.

622
00:32:34,476 --> 00:32:43,590
Rym: I just happened to scour the internet find a guy, call him on the phone get him to give me an address where I could mail him VHS tapes and he would then send me fan subs of a show from Japan.

623
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,060
Rym: I just happened to do that.

624
00:32:45,384 --> 00:32:47,325
Scott: Yeah, I just happened to do that.

625
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:53,929
Rym: This was an era when I had seen literally every piece of anime I could get my grubby little meat hooks on.

626
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:54,354
Scott: That's right.

627
00:32:54,537 --> 00:32:56,358
Rym: I would have watched anything.

628
00:32:56,398 --> 00:32:58,228
Rym: In fact, I watched some shit.

629
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,469
Rym: I watched Armageddon more than once.

630
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:01,976
Rym: No.

631
00:33:02,991 --> 00:33:05,310
Rym: Doom Megalopolis, Wind of Amnesia.

632
00:33:06,313 --> 00:33:16,090
Rym: Anyway, so I'm going to say right now that Sailor Moon, the expanded universe is basically Green Lantern, manga style.

633
00:33:16,292 --> 00:33:19,683
Scott: I think it might even be worse even though I hesitate to say that anything could be worse.

634
00:33:22,193 --> 00:33:23,242
Scott: It's equal at best.

635
00:33:23,383 --> 00:33:30,476
Rym: Watching this movie which should be relatively like, alright Sailor Moon, you kind of know they have magical powers based on the planets and they fight crime.

636
00:33:30,517 --> 00:33:31,329
Rym: You can deal with this.

637
00:33:32,674 --> 00:33:43,529
Rym: Every question Scott would ask I would start to answer and realize that there was no way to answer that would make any sense to anyone who had not seen all the rest of this bullshit.

638
00:33:44,016 --> 00:33:45,050
Rym: It's got to be like, who's that one?

639
00:33:45,573 --> 00:33:50,054
Rym: Well, so that's the daughter of Sailor Moon and the tuxedo guy from the future.

640
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:51,570
Rym: when they re-found the empire.

641
00:33:52,973 --> 00:33:53,770
Scott: but... What empire?

642
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:56,236
Scott: These are like high school girls who live in some town.

643
00:33:56,256 --> 00:34:04,530
Rym: Oh yeah, because in the past before the show started there was another empire that collapsed and all those sailors are the reincarnated people from that empire.

644
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:10,270
Rym: And there was no way to answer any questions Scott had about this show basically.

645
00:34:11,992 --> 00:34:12,422
Scott: Keep going.

646
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:19,121
Rym: But the best part was that at the peak of all the bomb bomb babies are kicking their asses in a tuxedo mask.

647
00:34:19,746 --> 00:34:22,350
Rym: who is still to this day one of those ridiculous characters.

648
00:34:22,451 --> 00:34:24,047
Scott: I don't understand this guy.

649
00:34:24,068 --> 00:34:26,855
Scott: They have these people with magical powers and they're failing.

650
00:34:27,077 --> 00:34:29,078
Scott: So this guy with no magical powers whatsoever.

651
00:34:29,098 --> 00:34:32,329
Scott: It was just a human wearing a tuxedo, a top hat and a mask on his face.

652
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:36,027
Rym: He can throw a rose and he can hit you with his little cane.

653
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:38,389
Scott: He throws roses and he's just a dude.

654
00:34:39,054 --> 00:34:44,489
Scott: he comes in and he actually tries to think he can help out the magical people who are failing.

655
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,309
Scott: That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

656
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:54,126
Scott: But at least, it's even dumber than Batman trying to help Superman, but at least he gets friggin' sent to the hospital.

657
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:54,914
Scott: That makes sense.

658
00:34:54,954 --> 00:34:55,702
Scott: I was glad for that.

659
00:34:55,722 --> 00:34:59,579
Scott: Because it's like yeah, normal guy can't do shit and he gets sent to the hospital.

660
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:04,510
Rym: So he does actually get powers and become a space knight at one point, but that stops happening.

661
00:35:05,635 --> 00:35:15,679
Rym: Anyway, part of it too is that a lot of the weird things that happen in this movie and all the Sailor Moon movies, and they're all only an hour long, are basically like shout outs.

662
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:16,124
Scott: Yeah, that was.

663
00:35:16,144 --> 00:35:17,883
Scott: the saving grace of this movie is that it was short.

664
00:35:17,923 --> 00:35:20,730
Rym: They're shout outs and are callbacks to tropes of the show.

665
00:35:21,351 --> 00:35:26,589
Rym: A trope of the show, especially early on, was Sailor Moon can't do shit and doesn't know what to do.

666
00:35:26,911 --> 00:35:29,276
Rym: And then Tuxedo Mask appears and says, "Sailor Moon, use your

667
00:35:29,317 --> 00:35:29,721
Rym: powers!".

668
00:35:29,741 --> 00:35:30,974
Rym: She's like, "Oh right, she uses her

669
00:35:30,994 --> 00:35:31,256
Rym: powers.".

670
00:35:31,418 --> 00:35:33,298
Rym: Oh right, I have magic.

671
00:35:33,319 --> 00:35:34,249
Scott: That's how I transform.

672
00:35:34,451 --> 00:35:36,430
Scott: Maybe I should use that on the bad guy.

673
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:39,702
Rym: Her first power is to take her little tiara off and throw it at someone.

674
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:40,855
Rym: Just keep doing that!

675
00:35:40,916 --> 00:35:41,870
Rym: They turn to dust!

676
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,830
Rym: They die immediately.

677
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:47,764
Scott: I was like, why didn't she just throw that tiara at the big queen, whatever she was?

678
00:35:47,784 --> 00:35:48,430
Rym: Nah, I can't.

679
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,448
Rym: You can't use your full power.

680
00:35:50,475 --> 00:35:52,130
Scott: You used it on the bonbon babies!

681
00:35:52,711 --> 00:35:53,929
Scott: You can't use it on the big baws?

682
00:35:55,155 --> 00:35:59,399
Scott: If I had a tiara that turned people to dust, I'd just be throwing it all the time at any bad guys.

683
00:35:59,621 --> 00:36:00,935
Scott: But not good guys, like X-Cop.

684
00:36:01,137 --> 00:36:05,098
Rym: But Sailor says she is completely incompetent through this whole situation.

685
00:36:05,219 --> 00:36:08,310
Scott: And then, later in the show, these other Sailors show up.

686
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:08,917
Scott: The extra Sailors.

687
00:36:08,937 --> 00:36:09,790
Rym: Yeah, Scott's like, "Is anyone

688
00:36:09,911 --> 00:36:10,355
Rym: competent?".

689
00:36:10,416 --> 00:36:11,506
Rym: I'm like, "Actually, yes.

690
00:36:11,607 --> 00:36:11,950
Rym: The outer

691
00:36:12,031 --> 00:36:12,454
Rym: sentient.".

692
00:36:12,475 --> 00:36:14,634
Rym: Then they show up, and they're like, "What the fuck is up?

693
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:15,321
Rym: I got a sword!

694
00:36:15,402 --> 00:36:15,826
Rym: Let's kick some

695
00:36:15,988 --> 00:36:16,129
Rym: ass!".

696
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,402
Scott: Yeah, they show up, and they're like, "Aw

697
00:36:17,603 --> 00:36:17,826
Scott: shit.".

698
00:36:17,866 --> 00:36:19,360
Scott: They actually use their magic powers.

699
00:36:19,381 --> 00:36:19,966
Scott: And I was like, "Fuck

700
00:36:19,986 --> 00:36:20,209
Scott: yeah.".

701
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:27,489
Rym: Now, again, I had to explain that their job, Green Lantern Universe, is to defend the solar system from external threats.

702
00:36:28,172 --> 00:36:29,019
Rym: They're not supposed to get involved.

703
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:29,785
Scott: Then why do they show up?

704
00:36:29,805 --> 00:36:31,361
Scott: to get involved with Candy Prawn?

705
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:40,589
Rym: And I realized the only argument I had here, this is some Radio Free Equestria Gandalf girthing, is that they showed up because the plot is basically

706
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:42,566
Scott: Sailor-esque

707
00:36:43,073 --> 00:36:54,490
Rym: alien comes down with technology and forces the fairies, the candy fairies, of planet Earth to help her steal children so she can have wonderful dreams with them in her black dream hole.

708
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:55,173
Scott: Yeah.

709
00:36:56,248 --> 00:37:01,159
Rym: And because this happened, the Outer Senji were like, "Oh shit, we let one through.

710
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,917
Rym: We better go clean that up before we get in

711
00:37:02,937 --> 00:37:03,280
Rym: trouble.".

712
00:37:04,271 --> 00:37:06,269
Rym: Also, the Inner Senji can't deal with this shit.

713
00:37:07,151 --> 00:37:09,850
Rym: The Green Lantern on Earth can't deal with the Galactus whatevers.

714
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:10,716
Scott: It is a thing, right?

715
00:37:10,756 --> 00:37:16,110
Scott: Those Outer Senji, whatever, they were way confident and way stronger powers, and they looked older and cooler.

716
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:17,442
Rym: Yeah, they're in high school.

717
00:37:17,463 --> 00:37:19,850
Scott: And they actually didn't hesitate to use- they look like college.

718
00:37:20,551 --> 00:37:24,210
Scott: I guess like the Sailor Moon, it's weird, it's like the opposite of current animes.

719
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:26,552
Scott: Current animes, it's like, "What is she in?

720
00:37:26,572 --> 00:37:27,178
Scott: She's in high school.

721
00:37:27,198 --> 00:37:27,803
Scott: She looks like she's

722
00:37:27,844 --> 00:37:27,965
Scott: two.".

723
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:33,103
Scott: But now it's like, "Well, those middle school girls look like high school girls, and the high school girls look like college

724
00:37:33,123 --> 00:37:33,367
Scott: girls.".

725
00:37:34,454 --> 00:37:39,750
Scott: But do those outer ones, do they live on the outer planets, like Pluto, or do they actually go to school somewhere on Earth?

726
00:37:39,951 --> 00:37:46,350
Rym: So, it's complicated, depending on what era of Sailor Moon we're in, but yeah, the two- Do they live on Titan or Europa or something?

727
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:49,530
Rym: So, Haruka and Michiru, Ernest and Neptune, they actually- The lesbians?

728
00:37:50,172 --> 00:37:50,738
Rym: Yeah, the lesbians.

729
00:37:50,778 --> 00:37:51,869
Rym: They went to a high school.

730
00:37:53,814 --> 00:37:56,250
Rym: There's stuff with that high school that tried to destroy the world.

731
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:56,953
Rym: Great.

732
00:37:57,821 --> 00:37:58,670
Scott: It's a pedo high school.

733
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:03,950
Rym: No, when the Holy Grail came, and they had to stop Pharaoh from destroying the world with the Holy Grail.

734
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,186
Rym: Wait, King Arthur's Holy Grail?

735
00:38:05,307 --> 00:38:05,449
Scott: Yeah.

736
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,609
Scott: But the Pharaoh Ramses wanted the Holy Grail?

737
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:11,730
Rym: No, basically the Pharaoh is the same as the villain from The Fifth Element.

738
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:12,811
Scott: Oh.

739
00:38:12,932 --> 00:38:17,134
Rym: Like, actually, to the point that when I saw The Fifth Element- Stargate?

740
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:18,753
Rym: No, more like Fifth Element.

741
00:38:18,814 --> 00:38:19,116
Rym: Okay.

742
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:21,338
Scott: When I saw The Fifth Element- Ruby Rodd?

743
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:24,934
Rym: I remember literally thinking, "Wow, did they steal this from Sailor

744
00:38:24,974 --> 00:38:25,177
Rym: Moon?".

745
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:25,948
Scott: What the fuck?

746
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:29,096
Rym: Like, it's so the same thing.

747
00:38:29,399 --> 00:38:29,844
Scott: Anyway.

748
00:38:29,945 --> 00:38:30,370
Scott: Ruby Rodd.

749
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:33,539
Scott: But they showed up, and they're all confident, but they didn't actually get the job done.

750
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:38,164
Scott: They just sort of picked off the Bon-Bon babies and stuff, and- Well, they picked them off.

751
00:38:38,185 --> 00:38:40,310
Scott: Sailor Moon had to actually get the real job done.

752
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:45,539
Rym: So, there's a trope to the Sailor Moon movies of Sailor Moon, you know, everyone's failed.

753
00:38:45,862 --> 00:38:48,370
Scott: But Sailor Moon is way less powerful and way less dumb.

754
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:50,359
Rym: She is, in fact, the most powerful.

755
00:38:50,379 --> 00:38:50,560
Scott: Then why?

756
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:54,694
Rym: the powers are weird and different, and it's complicated.

757
00:38:54,714 --> 00:38:55,300
Scott: Just use them.

758
00:38:55,321 --> 00:38:56,190
Scott: You've used them before.

759
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:57,547
Rym: This isn't the first movie, right?

760
00:38:57,587 --> 00:38:57,648
Scott: No.

761
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:57,750
Scott: So.

762
00:38:58,051 --> 00:39:00,754
Scott: It's not movie one, which means you've used the power before.

763
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:03,015
Scott: Use whatever you used before, right?

764
00:39:03,197 --> 00:39:04,834
Scott: Fist of the North Star doesn't get this wrong.

765
00:39:05,096 --> 00:39:06,428
Scott: He learns Musou Tensei.

766
00:39:06,772 --> 00:39:08,389
Scott: He uses Musou Tensei.

767
00:39:08,611 --> 00:39:10,066
Scott: He doesn't forget it, right?

768
00:39:10,106 --> 00:39:11,682
Scott: When he needs to use it, he whips it out.

769
00:39:11,743 --> 00:39:16,550
Rym: So, in the show, every half-season or so, she learns a new power, like, levels up.

770
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,661
Rym: They all learn new powers.

771
00:39:17,762 --> 00:39:18,005
Rym: Cool.

772
00:39:18,065 --> 00:39:20,090
Scott: How many powers did they know by the time this episode?

773
00:39:20,292 --> 00:39:24,230
Rym: So, you notice how all the individual sailors kept using, like, different powers that was based on?

774
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:27,128
Scott: They didn't really have that many of them, but they used three or four each.

775
00:39:28,611 --> 00:39:33,243
Scott: And the thing that really bothered me is, like, they whipped out, like, all these sword handles that didn't have swords on them.

776
00:39:33,607 --> 00:39:37,950
Scott: So, they transformed, but then they didn't actually even have the handles afterwards.

777
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:41,729
Scott: And I'm like, you have this tool used in your transformation sequence, and where'd the tool go?

778
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:47,041
Scott: But then the better ones showed up, and they actually had, like, swords and staves, and they actually used them.

779
00:39:47,142 --> 00:39:48,676
Rym: Well, because they're the badasses.

780
00:39:48,717 --> 00:39:50,474
Rym: Pluto is one of the baddest asses there is.

781
00:39:50,514 --> 00:39:56,049
Scott: Right, why didn't the badasses get the whole job done, and why didn't Sailor Moon just go back home and take care of the frickin' tuxedo guy?

782
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:57,628
Rym: Who's in the hospital?

783
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:01,868
Rym: Sailor Saturn's power is destroy all of existence right the fuck.

784
00:40:01,908 --> 00:40:03,140
Rym: now, the end of everything.

785
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,646
Scott: Alright, so you should stay home, because that power's useless.

786
00:40:05,686 --> 00:40:05,848
Scott: Yeah.

787
00:40:07,132 --> 00:40:10,050
Scott: In fact, why didn't the other sailors just fucking kill Sailor Saturn?

788
00:40:10,171 --> 00:40:10,918
Scott: That doesn't ever happen.

789
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,778
Rym: Uh, that's actually the plot of Sailor--.

790
00:40:12,798 --> 00:40:15,829
Scott: 'Cause somebody is just gonna, like, possess Sailor Saturn and make that happen.

791
00:40:16,111 --> 00:40:18,569
Rym: So, Scott, that's pretty much the plot of Sailor Moon S.

792
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:19,870
Scott: Oh, at least that's not so dumb.

793
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:25,269
Rym: She's a girl, and, you know, all the sense-- Is she some, like, high school girl who's dumb?

794
00:40:25,811 --> 00:40:29,085
Rym: Uh, no, she's actually eerily, like, scarily smart and weird.

795
00:40:29,105 --> 00:40:29,430
Rym: Well, that's good.

796
00:40:29,931 --> 00:40:38,417
Rym: And she knows what's up, and her dad's a scientist, and that's actually-- If you're ever gonna watch Sailor Moon, Sailor Moon S is probably the best one to watch.

797
00:40:38,437 --> 00:40:39,530
Scott: So that's not what we watched?

798
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:41,244
Rym: No, Sailor Moon S, the show.

799
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:42,986
Scott: So we watched Super S, the movie.

800
00:40:43,006 --> 00:40:43,209
Scott: The movie.

801
00:40:43,473 --> 00:40:44,409
Scott: What's super about it?

802
00:40:45,831 --> 00:40:51,694
Scott: It's just Super S, as opposed to S, and I-- Is there a Super S TV show?

803
00:40:51,957 --> 00:40:56,082
Rym: Yes, the TV shows go Sailor Moon, then there's that Alan and Anne bullshit.

804
00:40:56,284 --> 00:40:56,810
Scott: What's that?

805
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:59,310
Rym: Just, like, between that and Sailor Moon R.

806
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:00,847
Scott: Is it an OAV or a TV or a movie?

807
00:41:00,867 --> 00:41:03,755
Rym: It's like just the next season after the first Queen Beryl thing ends.

808
00:41:03,978 --> 00:41:04,200
Rym: Oh, okay.

809
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:13,390
Rym: So there's the Queen Beryl arc, then there's the Alan and Anne arc, and then what is colloquial known as Sailor Moon R, which is arguably Alan and Anne and the next thing with Prince Diamond.

810
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:19,249
Rym: Then there's Sailor Moon S, which is about the Holy Grail, Pharaoh, Saturn destroying the universe.

811
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:20,443
Scott: So that's all the epic stuff?

812
00:41:20,484 --> 00:41:21,010
Scott: That's the epic stuff.

813
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,442
Scott: That's why you want people to watch that one?

814
00:41:22,463 --> 00:41:23,593
Rym: Super S is Pegasus--.

815
00:41:23,613 --> 00:41:24,704
Scott: So that has all the cosmic stuff?

816
00:41:24,805 --> 00:41:26,890
Rym: Super S is Pegasus and candy and bullshit.

817
00:41:27,734 --> 00:41:28,786
Scott: The TV show and the movie?

818
00:41:28,927 --> 00:41:29,110
Scott: Yes.

819
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:32,384
Rym: But different Pegasuses and different bullshit and different candy.

820
00:41:32,546 --> 00:41:32,810
Scott: Okay.

821
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:40,210
Rym: And Sailor Stars is the girls who turn into guys who come from, it's like super galactic.

822
00:41:41,693 --> 00:41:42,746
Rym: Andromeda.

823
00:41:42,847 --> 00:41:43,030
Scott: Yes.

824
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:51,978
Rym: Sailor S is like the Green Lantern expanded universe, then Super S is like, I don't even know.

825
00:41:51,998 --> 00:41:52,670
Scott: You mean stars.

826
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:53,696
Rym: Yeah, stars.

827
00:41:53,736 --> 00:41:56,484
Rym: Stars is like the next step out.

828
00:41:56,665 --> 00:41:58,350
Scott: So then what's the end of Sailor Moon?

829
00:41:59,634 --> 00:42:00,102
Rym: Stars.

830
00:42:00,122 --> 00:42:00,386
Rym: Is it?

831
00:42:01,031 --> 00:42:03,836
Rym: So stars basically is like--.

832
00:42:03,856 --> 00:42:05,936
Scott: So each of these things is a TV show and a movie?

833
00:42:05,997 --> 00:42:06,300
Scott: Are there OAVs?

834
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,250
Rym: There's no stars movie.

835
00:42:07,633 --> 00:42:08,501
Rym: Oh, okay.

836
00:42:08,542 --> 00:42:10,702
Scott: But every other thing is a TV show and a movie?

837
00:42:11,005 --> 00:42:12,682
Rym: Yes, and the movies have nothing to do with the show.

838
00:42:12,702 --> 00:42:14,887
Scott: So like there's an R TV series and an R movie?

839
00:42:14,988 --> 00:42:17,167
Rym: Yes, the R movie is the gay guy from space who ruins every movie.

840
00:42:17,187 --> 00:42:19,006
Scott: And the movie comes after each TV series?

841
00:42:19,046 --> 00:42:21,530
Rym: The movie does not make sense or fit into the continuity at all.

842
00:42:22,032 --> 00:42:22,665
Scott: None of the movies?

843
00:42:22,726 --> 00:42:22,910
Rym: Nope.

844
00:42:23,351 --> 00:42:24,562
Rym: They're like the comic book movie.

845
00:42:24,643 --> 00:42:25,895
Scott: Were these movies in theaters?

846
00:42:26,805 --> 00:42:28,363
Rym: As far as I can tell, they were.

847
00:42:28,545 --> 00:42:28,848
Rym: Whoa.

848
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:30,122
Scott: They're like Pokemon movies.

849
00:42:30,365 --> 00:42:30,467
Rym: Yes.

850
00:42:31,654 --> 00:42:32,221
Scott: As far as I can tell.

851
00:42:32,241 --> 00:42:32,808
Scott: Or One Piece movies.

852
00:42:35,997 --> 00:42:45,578
Rym: So another trope of a Sailor Moon movie is that everyone fails and then there's an impossible situation like we're all gonna die or you can't stop this.

853
00:42:45,639 --> 00:42:48,063
Rym: You can't get out of a black dream hole once you crawl into it.

854
00:42:48,528 --> 00:42:50,463
Rym: And then Sailor Moon will say, "I have to try

855
00:42:50,483 --> 00:42:50,705
Rym: anyway!".

856
00:42:51,594 --> 00:42:52,449
Rym: And then she dies.

857
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,255
Rym: Or something.

858
00:42:53,377 --> 00:42:55,477
Rym: And then magically she comes back anyway.

859
00:42:56,002 --> 00:42:56,910
Scott: That's exactly what happened.

860
00:42:57,372 --> 00:42:58,464
Rym: That happens in all the movies.

861
00:42:58,667 --> 00:42:58,950
Scott: Okay.

862
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,689
Rym: Happens all the time.

863
00:43:01,051 --> 00:43:01,455
Scott: Okay.

864
00:43:02,081 --> 00:43:04,469
Rym: Though in the R movie she actually just dies.

865
00:43:05,098 --> 00:43:05,908
Rym: And then comes back to life.

866
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:07,643
Rym: For basically no reason.

867
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:08,430
Scott: Okay.

868
00:43:09,571 --> 00:43:15,115
Rym: But they have a Sailor Teleport in that one, which I'm surprised they didn't use here because the fact that they meet the outer sentries.

869
00:43:15,135 --> 00:43:19,641
Scott: Yeah, they had to go make a boat or something to get to where the space station they need to go to.

870
00:43:19,662 --> 00:43:25,721
Rym: Even if these don't fit in the continuity, they knew Sailor Teleport before they met those outer sentries, so ugh.

871
00:43:26,226 --> 00:43:26,670
Rym: God.

872
00:43:27,451 --> 00:43:33,910
Rym: Also, Queen Badine looks almost exactly like Sailor Galaxia from Starz, so maybe there's a connection?

873
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:37,101
Scott: Maybe it's just the same artist, lazy character designer?

874
00:43:37,222 --> 00:43:39,550
Rym: I can Gandalf girth a connection, but I'm not going to.

875
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:41,430
Rym: And also, we're not talking about the manga, which is different.

876
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:41,653
Rym: No manga.

877
00:43:44,134 --> 00:43:45,410
Scott: How much of the manga have you read?

878
00:43:46,072 --> 00:43:50,597
Rym: I've read like five or six random volumes of the manga in random books.

879
00:43:50,618 --> 00:43:52,538
Scott: Okay, I thought you were gonna say you read the whole thing.

880
00:43:52,841 --> 00:43:54,983
Rym: I've read like two Starzes and a few others.

881
00:43:55,003 --> 00:43:57,183
Scott: Didn't you read all of Meisani Goku off the shelf?

882
00:43:57,688 --> 00:43:57,930
Rym: Yes.

883
00:43:58,210 --> 00:43:59,370
Scott: Without ever buying a volume?

884
00:43:59,653 --> 00:44:02,969
Rym: I also read all the Sailor Moon that I ever read at the same Walden books.

885
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:08,561
Scott: Okay, so, Sailor Moon, the one we watched was super S.

886
00:44:08,582 --> 00:44:09,370
Rym: Super S movie.

887
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:10,850
Rym: The last Sailor Moon movie ever made.

888
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:13,250
Scott: Candy pedophiles and stupidity.

889
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:14,520
Rym: The movie.

890
00:44:15,171 --> 00:44:25,390
Scott: If you really want to lull and you were mad wasted on some substances and you want to see some guys convince children into his boat with candy.

891
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:30,229
Rym: To then take him to his master to put them in a black hole.

892
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:31,220
Rym: Queen Badian.

893
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,489
Rym: Queen Badian.

894
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:36,944
Rym: Which means, roughly, Star Anus.

895
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:41,690
Scott: So he's gonna put him in the Anus black hole, these children that were lured.

896
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:44,379
Rym: No, into her wonderful black dream hole.

897
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:51,608
Scott: Right, so they lure children with candy into the queen's wonderful black dream hole of Anus.

898
00:44:53,511 --> 00:44:55,165
Scott: You can watch this movie.

899
00:44:55,205 --> 00:44:56,073
Scott: It's only an hour.

900
00:44:56,114 --> 00:44:57,289
Scott: You're not suffering that much.

901
00:44:57,350 --> 00:45:00,670
Rym: And all the Sailor Moon movies are actually really well animated.

902
00:45:01,473 --> 00:45:03,170
Scott: Yeah, the animation was actually pretty good.

903
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:06,040
Scott: I don't know what year it was from, but I was like, "Oh, high budget on the

904
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:06,242
Scott: animation.".

905
00:45:06,263 --> 00:45:06,830
Rym: Sailor Moon's hit or miss.

906
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:09,995
Rym: There's a point in stars where the animation goes way to shit.

907
00:45:10,076 --> 00:45:14,501
Rym: I think there were scab artists because something happened during the series.

908
00:45:14,561 --> 00:45:15,389
Scott: I'm sure Wikipedia knows it.

909
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:20,153
Rym: There's a few episodes where the animation goes way off model and way to shit.

910
00:45:20,174 --> 00:45:20,550
Scott: Island episodes.

911
00:45:21,693 --> 00:45:23,833
Rym: There are parts of Sailor Moon, especially the movies.

912
00:45:23,853 --> 00:45:26,830
Rym: They're actually the facial expressions and the way they're drawn.

913
00:45:28,194 --> 00:45:29,430
Rym: The animation is great.

914
00:45:29,831 --> 00:45:32,670
Rym: I forgot how much I like some of this old cel animation.

915
00:45:33,671 --> 00:45:36,399
Rym: The animation alone makes up for...

916
00:45:36,601 --> 00:45:40,284
Scott: I mean, there was a lot of stuff where you would see they weren't trying.

917
00:45:40,386 --> 00:45:43,165
Scott: They were skimping on the animation, right?

918
00:45:43,186 --> 00:45:48,115
Scott: There'd be a scene where only the mouth moves or the people are just sort of standing there.

919
00:45:48,216 --> 00:45:48,783
Rym: But it was all.

920
00:45:49,531 --> 00:45:51,026
Scott: really the colors are nice.

921
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:53,288
Scott: It was high resolution, even though it wasn't HD.

922
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:55,410
Scott: It was pretty good.

923
00:45:55,590 --> 00:46:00,298
Scott: Like, wow, this looks pretty great, considering it's a one hour throwaway kind of movie situation.

924
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:03,129
Rym: It was surprisingly okay to watch, again.

925
00:46:03,472 --> 00:46:04,629
Rym: I saw it once a long time ago.

926
00:46:05,433 --> 00:46:12,282
Scott: It wasn't painful to watch, and it was fun to make fun of, but this isn't some great anime movie you've got to run out to see right away.

927
00:46:12,566 --> 00:46:12,810
Rym: Yeah.

928
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:18,528
Rym: Though it is worth watching at least one of the three Sailor Moon movies, just to kind of get a feel for what Sailor Moon is and was.

929
00:46:19,554 --> 00:46:20,829
Rym: And to know that thing.

930
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:22,346
Rym: To know what that is.

931
00:46:23,412 --> 00:46:25,188
Rym: Also, the plot of this really is The Matrix.

932
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:28,508
Rym: But with pied pedo pepper pipers.

933
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:31,921
Rym: Pedo piper bear pepper.

934
00:46:31,941 --> 00:46:34,890
Scott: Imagine if Noah from Noah's Ark was collecting to children.

935
00:46:36,967 --> 00:46:40,450
Scott: But because he wanted to start the flood, not because the flood already was coming.

936
00:46:41,051 --> 00:46:43,348
Scott: He was going to use the children to make a flood.

937
00:46:45,776 --> 00:46:46,263
Rym: If only.

938
00:46:46,283 --> 00:46:53,718
Rym: I kind of want to know what Kunihiko Ikuhara's version of this was going to be because it focused only on the awesome sailors.

939
00:46:54,042 --> 00:47:05,175
Rym: And the plot was apparently going to be that one of them was in a deep sleep, like in this dream world, and the other one was going to go attack the other normal sailors and steal their shit and use that to save her girlfriend.

940
00:47:05,317 --> 00:47:10,369
Scott: Dude, one sailor with all the sailor shit who's confident and actually can cast all those spells at once.

941
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:13,499
Scott: That's got to be much better than this movie.

942
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:13,843
Rym: Yeah.

943
00:47:13,944 --> 00:47:14,570
Rym: That we just saw.

944
00:47:14,671 --> 00:47:27,323
Rym: Ikuhara said, which is really interesting, in an interview, that he took a lot of the ideas he had for what was going to be the Sailor Moon Super S movie and pulled them out of his bag when it was time to make Shoujo Kakumei Utena.

945
00:47:27,566 --> 00:47:27,830
Scott: Great.

946
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:34,690
Rym: Which, that's why I want to see what this movie would have been because I think it would have been a lot like Utena because he realized there's swords being pulled out of people's chests and stuff.

947
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:36,610
Scott: Instead, it's just a throw away whatever.

948
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:39,320
Rym: Yeah, with the guys who turned into birds.

949
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:40,008
Rym: Yeah.

950
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:41,308
Rym: Banana and orange.

951
00:47:42,838 --> 00:47:46,198
Scott: At least their existence in character design is humorous.

952
00:47:46,401 --> 00:47:46,684
Scott: Yeah.

953
00:47:46,967 --> 00:47:48,466
Scott: That's the best I can say about that.

954
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:50,138
Rym: That's all we can say.

955
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:52,007
Rym: I don't know, watch some anime.

956
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,510
Scott: Yeah, there's probably something else you could be watching instead of this.

957
00:48:01,923 --> 00:48:04,163
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

958
00:48:04,224 --> 00:48:09,180
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

959
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:14,650
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

960
00:48:14,872 --> 00:48:17,540
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

961
00:48:17,801 --> 00:48:21,760
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

963
00:48:27,075 --> 00:48:30,145
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

964
00:48:30,346 --> 00:48:33,200
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
