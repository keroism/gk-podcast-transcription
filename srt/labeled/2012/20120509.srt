1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,689
Rym: It's Wednesday, May 9th, 2012.

2
00:00:10,689 --> 00:00:10,911
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,845 --> 00:00:13,218
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,145
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,205 --> 00:00:20,420
Rym: Tonight, the anime that everyone forgot about somehow, despite being surprisingly popular in the US.

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,218
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:31,298
Scott: So it's getting close to the end of the work day, and my phone goes ring-a-ling, and I'm like,

8
00:00:31,338 --> 00:00:31,619
Scott: "What?".

9
00:00:32,082 --> 00:00:34,360
Rym: I predict another fascinating anecdote.

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,347
Scott: And I'm like, "Who the hell is calling me?

11
00:00:36,407 --> 00:00:37,250
Scott: No one calls me.

12
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,498
Scott: You're not supposed to call on the telephone in the modern

13
00:00:39,538 --> 00:00:39,980
Scott: times.".

14
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:40,722
Rym: Yeah, it is.

15
00:00:40,762 --> 00:00:48,140
Rym: Whenever I get a phone call, and it's not during an event where I'm rapidly in real-time coordinating with people, it's always kind of weird.

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:55,138
Rym: It's like, "Alright, you're calling me, so it must be urgent, but I'm not talking to you online, so it's probably like someone got

17
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:56,060
Rym: hospitalized.".

18
00:00:56,961 --> 00:01:00,612
Scott: So, first of all, it wasn't one of those blocked numbers.

19
00:01:00,712 --> 00:01:03,320
Scott: It showed the number, and it showed where the area code was.

20
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,220
Scott: Uh-huh.

21
00:01:04,521 --> 00:01:06,526
Scott: And I was like, "Huh, alright,".

22
00:01:06,586 --> 00:01:11,580
Scott: but obviously they weren't in my contacts, and I think they were from far away, like Texas or Arizona or something.

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:11,929
Scott: I was like,

24
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:12,156
Scott: "What?".

25
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:20,278
Scott: So anyway, I'm like, "Alright, speak," and I pick it up, and immediately it says, "We are from political

26
00:01:20,398 --> 00:01:21,120
Scott: something-something.".

27
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,633
Scott: I think it's gonna be one of those political survey situations, right?

28
00:01:23,653 --> 00:01:24,357
Scott: Like, "Who you gonna vote

29
00:01:24,397 --> 00:01:24,638
Scott: for?".

30
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,943
Rym: You know, I used to.

31
00:01:26,023 --> 00:01:37,820
Rym: There was a time in my life, up until about four years ago, when I would, whenever anyone like that called me, I would mess with them, I'd talk to them, I'd do something, but I don't have time for that anymore.

32
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:48,200
Rym: If anyone calls me, and it is not immediately apparent that they are a human who has something real to tell me that I probably already know, I just hang up without saying a word, and if they call back, I block the number in Google.

33
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,979
Scott: So I just listen for a little bit, 'cause what else am I gonna do, right?

34
00:01:51,921 --> 00:02:02,699
Scott: And they're like, they pretty much said, "If you do this, we will give you a free two-day cruise to the Bahamas on behalf of the people who are paying for

35
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:02,919
Scott: this.".

36
00:02:03,561 --> 00:02:09,039
Rym: Oh, so it's one of those fake cruises where it's technically a real cruise, but they probably like force you to do stuff and sell you stuff.

37
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,675
Scott: I have no idea what it is.

38
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,300
Rym: And if you don't follow the rules, then they make you pay.

39
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,334
Scott: I have no idea what it is, but I'm like,

40
00:02:14,394 --> 00:02:14,998
Scott: "Whoa!".

41
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,700
Scott: So I put it on speakerphone so everyone can hear this hilariousness.

42
00:02:18,342 --> 00:02:23,939
Scott: It plays the message again, and it's like, "Press 2 to do the thing, and press 9, and we'll never call you

43
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:24,180
Scott: again.".

44
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,160
Scott: So while it's repeating this message over and over, I search for the name of this place.

45
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,178
Scott: You should've recorded it.

46
00:02:29,882 --> 00:02:30,418
Scott: How do you do that?

47
00:02:30,902 --> 00:02:31,531
Rym: Google Voice.

48
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,220
Rym: You just hit--.

49
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,080
Scott: I don't have Google Voice.

50
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:34,166
Rym: Oh.

51
00:02:34,186 --> 00:02:36,460
Rym: I record every phone conversation I have.

52
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,000
Scott: That's cool.

53
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:47,260
Scott: So I go to search for the name of the political whatever it is, and I'm at Google, and I add the word "scam," and they're like, "Yeah, dudes, it's a scam.

54
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:49,519
Scott: They're just trying to get you to pay a hundred and something bucks.

55
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:51,308
Scott: That's all it is, is?

56
00:02:51,328 --> 00:02:52,054
Scott: they're just trying to get your

57
00:02:52,095 --> 00:02:52,317
Scott: money.".

58
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,720
Scott: And it's like two-day cruise, seriously.

59
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:01,216
Scott: It's like even if you figured out how to actually get the cruise, even if there's no other weird loopholes on it, two days, it's like, "Yeah, we'll take it there.

60
00:03:01,236 --> 00:03:01,797
Scott: We'll take it back up.

61
00:03:01,937 --> 00:03:02,599
Scott: Okay,

62
00:03:02,619 --> 00:03:02,760
Scott: bye.".

63
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:07,020
Scott: And tiny cabin with a bunch of people who fell for the scam are also on the cruise.

64
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,520
Rym: Yeah, the kind of people you probably don't want to hang out with.

65
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,320
Scott: Especially not in a boat that you can't escape from in the middle of the water.

66
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,940
Rym: I really just don't see the appeal of the standard cruise.

67
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:32,800
Rym: You could do a cool kind of cruise in a lot of situations, but it seems like when most people say they're going on a cruise, it's like Princess or something, and it's basically a floating Marriott for a week with a bunch of the kinds of people who would go to a floating Marriott for a week.

68
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,480
Scott: Imagine if you took the Magfest hotel, put it on a boat, and some of the food's free and some is not.

69
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,439
Rym: Now, that would be awesome.

70
00:03:39,222 --> 00:03:39,960
Scott: But there's no Magfest.

71
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:41,819
Rym: If Magfest were happening during it.

72
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:45,257
Scott: Yeah, anyway, Mag cruise, get it going.

73
00:03:45,277 --> 00:03:45,840
Scott: All right, anyway.

74
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:47,989
Rym: What's the phrase?

75
00:03:48,593 --> 00:03:49,440
Rym: People say this a lot.

76
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,830
Rym: The only people who go on those cruises are newlywed or nearly dead.

77
00:03:52,851 --> 00:03:53,232
Rym: Anyway.

78
00:03:56,501 --> 00:04:03,040
Scott: Anyway, so the point is, if you get the same phone call, it's a scam, obviously.

79
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:09,316
Scott: If you needed me to tell you it was a scam, I recommend you just not pick up your phone ever.

80
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,400
Scott: And don't go to any web pages.

81
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:20,399
Rym: If any number calls you and it's not a human telling you something that's real and somehow relates to you in a direct way, it's a scam.

82
00:04:21,601 --> 00:04:24,160
Rym: Or it's a telemarketer, which is basically a scam.

83
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,446
Scott: Everything's a scam.

84
00:04:25,526 --> 00:04:27,980
Scott: This is the only way to be safe if you are too dumb to tell.

85
00:04:30,841 --> 00:04:40,880
Rym: So it's not really news that the New York Anime Festival is happening, other than the fact that it is somehow surviving, much like a mitochondria inside of a cell of a larger being.

86
00:04:41,801 --> 00:04:52,331
Rym: But it appears to once again be relegated to the tiniest, backiest, most hidden corner of the Javits, and seems to have its own website and its own track.

87
00:04:52,411 --> 00:05:00,340
Rym: I imagine it'll have that, I hate to use this word, but I'm going to use it, pathetic anime stage instead of panel content or real rooms.

88
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:03,318
Rym: I think it's going to be pretty much the same thing as last year.

89
00:05:03,921 --> 00:05:06,560
Rym: So I don't really have anything to say about it except it's happening.

90
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:12,639
Rym: I've stopped submitting anime content to that event because it just doesn't seem worth it.

91
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:13,760
Scott: No, that's not worth it.

92
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:25,340
Rym: I mean, I'd still go to Otakon, Anime Boston, Zenkai Con, Kinetic Con, but the New York Anime Festival as a vestigial organ, an appendix to the New York Comic Con, is sad.

93
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,680
Rym: It feels like I went to the anime part and checked it out, and it felt like a small anime con.

94
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,920
Rym: It felt like that Ohio con, only pretty happening.

95
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:39,540
Scott: Like an artist alley with a lot of people in it, and a big room full of tables, and a stage with stereotypical stuff happening.

96
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,730
Rym: Now, here's my trouble with it.

97
00:05:40,771 --> 00:05:41,316
Rym: That area.

98
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:48,380
Rym: So the part that I can't deal with as I get older with anime cons is any public area at the con.

99
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:52,020
Rym: And the New York Anime Festival is nothing but that public area.

100
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,520
Rym: There's no panel room with Daryl Surratt doing something awesome or Mike Tool doing something awesome.

101
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,660
Rym: It's just one big room, and if you try to go to a panel, well, it's the anime stage.

102
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:03,409
Rym: You're still in that big room.

103
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,099
Rym: You can't escape it.

104
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:05,720
Scott: Nope.

105
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,838
Rym: So if we're there, we actually didn't present last year either.

106
00:06:10,762 --> 00:06:13,220
Rym: If we present, we're not presenting on that anime stage.

107
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,600
Rym: We're probably not doing any anime content.

108
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:16,132
Rym: Yep.

109
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,439
Rym: Either video games or comics or press.

110
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:21,780
Scott: Whatever.

111
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,520
Rym: I don't think we even really did a show on it after last year.

112
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:31,940
Rym: I didn't have much to say other than I talked to every employee of Hasbro, and none of them had anything to say about My Little Pony.

113
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,940
Scott: Maybe they'll have something to say this time.

114
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,461
Scott: They better.

115
00:06:34,642 --> 00:06:44,533
Rym: Last year, the only thing I got out of them was I kept asking around, and I was in a suit, and I had my press credential and all my stuff, and I was like, "Look, this is my assignment.

116
00:06:44,593 --> 00:06:45,638
Rym: I need to talk to someone about

117
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:45,779
Rym: this.".

118
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:51,480
Rym: So finally they put me in charge of the guy who was the head of whatever at the con for Hasbro.

119
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,257
Rym: And he was like, "Look, every press person who has come up to us has asked about My Little

120
00:06:56,277 --> 00:06:56,558
Rym: Pony.".

121
00:06:57,502 --> 00:06:59,995
Rym: We didn't anticipate anyone would be interested.

122
00:07:00,056 --> 00:07:00,920
Rym: We didn't bring anything.

123
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,126
Rym: I don't have anything to say.

124
00:07:02,146 --> 00:07:08,920
Rym: I could do an interview with you, but I literally have nothing to tell you that you can't find out from the website.

125
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:13,240
Scott: But it's like you work for this company, and you don't know anything about the things at the company you work for.

126
00:07:13,702 --> 00:07:15,998
Rym: No, so the only thing I asked him, I was like, "No, he knew about

127
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:16,079
Rym: it.".

128
00:07:16,584 --> 00:07:17,719
Rym: He didn't have anything to say to the press.

129
00:07:19,763 --> 00:07:28,179
Rym: They didn't expect anyone cared about My Little Pony, because this was still before bronies kind of became well-known to the mainstream of nerdery and internet-y.

130
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,180
Rym: Like, that was on the rising tide.

131
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,343
Scott: We knew.

132
00:07:30,485 --> 00:07:31,380
Scott: Why do we always know?

133
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,043
Rym: Of course we knew.

134
00:07:32,103 --> 00:07:33,231
Rym: We were not number one, though.

135
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:34,420
Rym: Don't pretend that we were number one.

136
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,493
Scott: I'm not saying I'm number one.

137
00:07:35,513 --> 00:07:35,959
Scott: I'm just saying...

138
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,035
Rym: People told us to watch it, and I was like,

139
00:07:38,055 --> 00:07:38,095
Rym: "Eh?"

140
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,108
Rym: Yeah, but I'm just saying, why do we...

141
00:07:41,148 --> 00:07:45,140
Scott: We weren't even the first, but yet we were still so far ahead of the curve.

142
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:46,059
Scott: How is this...

143
00:07:46,381 --> 00:07:51,076
Rym: Oh, Scott, it's easy, because we don't have anything better to do than to stare at the internet 24/7, constantly refreshing deeds of things.

144
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,841
Scott: Why are other people not staring at the internet 24/7?

145
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:58,516
Rym: One, that's actually pretty boring most of the time.

146
00:07:58,576 --> 00:07:59,140
Rym: I mean, I remember...

147
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,259
Scott: What else are they fucking doing?

148
00:08:01,383 --> 00:08:01,846
Rym: I don't know.

149
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:04,080
Rym: Having sex, going outside...

150
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,659
Scott: You don't need to do that shit.

151
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,835
Rym: No, Scott, I'm leading you in a different direction.

152
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:09,620
Rym: You're not going with me.

153
00:08:10,181 --> 00:08:11,900
Rym: The answer to that is Google Glass.

154
00:08:12,443 --> 00:08:12,720
Scott: That's right.

155
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:23,280
Rym: Anyway... But I do have some real things to talk about, because we kind of previewed the new Lupin, the Fujiko Mine show, but it's not all out yet.

156
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,500
Rym: We're not going to review it until it's all out, even though it's great.

157
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:34,380
Scott: We could really use another episode idea for a Wednesday show, and being able to talk about a good show again would be a great Wednesday episode.

158
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:43,460
Rym: Well, I want to see enough, because until recently, we hadn't gotten a full-on Zenigata, and we got a lot more Zenigata now, so I have more things to say.

159
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:54,720
Rym: But the other shows I've been watching, I've caught up on Venture Brothers, which half of you out there are going too little, too late, or somehow amazed that I'm so late to that party.

160
00:08:55,901 --> 00:09:04,220
Rym: And I've been watching Legend of Korra, which is amazing, but I can't talk about it, because Scott hasn't even seen the original Avatar, which is one of the best cartoons ever.

161
00:09:05,183 --> 00:09:05,729
Rym: Yeah, it is.

162
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,720
Rym: It's really good.

163
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:09,599
Rym: And the new one is way better than that one.

164
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:24,100
Rym: In fact, I would argue that the new Avatar is the third best, no, fourth best cartoon, maybe third best, that I am watching or have watched in recent memory, that is current.

165
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:28,620
Rym: That is right up there with Ponies, Archer, Venture Brothers.

166
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:34,160
Scott: So, only of those, only Ponies is excellent.

167
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,449
Rym: You haven't seen any of it.

168
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,940
Rym: You don't even know what it's about, or what it is.

169
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,320
Scott: I know I don't like Archer, and I've seen five minutes of Venture Brothers and didn't care.

170
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,640
Rym: Yeah, and what about Avatar?

171
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,079
Scott: I haven't seen any of it.

172
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,604
Rym: Really?

173
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,180
Scott: It's really good.

174
00:09:49,028 --> 00:09:49,440
Scott: Eh, whatever.

175
00:09:49,880 --> 00:10:03,520
Rym: Okay, but the other thing I've been watching, other than Space Brothers, because I'm actually watching a lot of cartoons lately, is Kids on the Slope, that jazz anime with music by Yoko Kanno and directed by the same guy who directed Cowboy Bebop.

176
00:10:05,464 --> 00:10:11,920
Rym: And no one's really talking about this, at least in my anime circles, except for the people who are hardcore about anime.

177
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,398
Scott: That's how it usually goes.

178
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,540
Rym: Even though it's a great show so far.

179
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,133
Scott: What are the typical anime punk kids talking about?

180
00:10:18,153 --> 00:10:19,520
Scott: There must be a show for them, right?

181
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,086
Scott: One Piece.

182
00:10:20,594 --> 00:10:20,959
Rym: Soul Eater.

183
00:10:22,153 --> 00:10:22,320
Scott: Still?

184
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,479
Scott: Soul Eater One Piece.

185
00:10:25,064 --> 00:10:27,620
Scott: I know One Piece is always going, but it's like... Soul Eater.

186
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:29,273
Scott: Is Soul Eater Bleach Naruto?

187
00:10:29,314 --> 00:10:30,040
Scott: Are those still going?

188
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:31,323
Rym: Yeah, pretty much.

189
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:35,735
Rym: Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood still seems to be pretty popular among the young kids, I guess.

190
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,678
Scott: Well, I don't even know.

191
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,580
Rym: People still talk about it.

192
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,874
Scott: I have every volume of the manga now.

193
00:10:40,894 --> 00:10:41,359
Scott: I'm gonna read it.

194
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,662
Rym: I'm waiting.

195
00:10:43,063 --> 00:10:51,200
Rym: The reason I haven't watched Brotherhood yet is that it has the problem that a good chunk of it is just a slightly crooked retelling of the anime I watched the first time.

196
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,540
Scott: Well, if it's like the manga, it is much more than slightly crooked.

197
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,280
Rym: Well, no, there's a point where they deviate heavily.

198
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,920
Scott: It's like volume one.

199
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,703
Scott: Yeah, but the anime...

200
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:09,560
Rym: I can't just skip that part because a number of people have told me that if I skip it and just start where things diverge, it won't make sense because they've crooked a few things just enough.

201
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,540
Scott: Well, there'll be characters that you don't even know who the fuck they are.

202
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:23,920
Rym: But the original Full Metal Alchemist, which was an amazing show but kind of forgettable, but I guess we'll talk about that in the second half because it's kind of relevant, is still too fresh in the memory.

203
00:11:24,201 --> 00:11:29,093
Rym: So I'm trying to wait until I get to the point where I say, "Hey, I should rewatch Full Metal Alchemist.

204
00:11:29,194 --> 00:11:29,775
Rym: It's been long

205
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:30,036
Rym: enough.".

206
00:11:30,076 --> 00:11:31,660
Rym: And then I'll just watch Brotherhood instead.

207
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:37,540
Scott: I'm just gonna read the whole manga and that should erase... that'll take over my Full Metal Alchemist portion of my brain.

208
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,260
Rym: Well, what worries me is that...

209
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,200
Scott: Kick out the anime part.

210
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:48,000
Rym: Dave Riley a while ago, this was a long time ago, said something like he started to watch Brotherhood, but then for whatever reason, I think him and Grotz started watching the original again.

211
00:11:48,822 --> 00:11:51,179
Rym: And they just kind of kept watching the original and finished that.

212
00:11:51,965 --> 00:11:52,260
Scott: Okay.

213
00:11:53,404 --> 00:11:55,380
Rym: I never even watched the movie of the original.

214
00:11:56,212 --> 00:11:56,380
Scott: Nope.

215
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,378
Rym: Like, I got it right away.

216
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,745
Scott: I think there were a few movies.

217
00:11:58,765 --> 00:12:02,120
Scott: I didn't even know what there was because all I did was watch the original TV and that's it.

218
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:14,440
Rym: I just remember being really excited about that movie and then when I realized how it was set and what it was about, I... I have never gone from interested in something to not interested in it as quickly as I did the Full Metal Alchemist movie.

219
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:15,652
Scott: Anyway.

220
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,087
Rym: Anyway, Kids in the Slope is pretty good.

221
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:23,580
Rym: You should watch it if you're an anime fan and we will review it once Scott has watched it as well.

222
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:24,802
Scott: Someday.

223
00:12:24,822 --> 00:12:27,459
Scott: I still didn't watch the previous whatever show.

224
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:28,605
Rym: What do you mean?

225
00:12:28,626 --> 00:12:29,439
Rym: the previous whatever show?

226
00:12:29,801 --> 00:12:32,120
Scott: By Watanabe, the Michiko show.

227
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:32,960
Rym: You didn't watch that either?

228
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,580
Rym: I've seen enough episodes to know it's awesome, but I didn't finish it.

229
00:12:36,141 --> 00:12:38,700
Scott: I really just not watching so much.

230
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,319
Scott: Why not?

231
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,975
Scott: Because I watched, you know, I watched...

232
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,499
Rym: It's because you're watching Ponies and Running Man.

233
00:12:43,783 --> 00:12:45,099
Scott: Well, I watch Running Man every week.

234
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:45,469
Scott: I know.

235
00:12:46,421 --> 00:12:51,840
Scott: It's because I watched so many long animes, like all Hokuto no Ken, all Galaxy Express, all Yamato.

236
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,539
Scott: I watched all these long shows and I barreled through every single episode of them.

237
00:12:57,581 --> 00:13:02,180
Scott: And now it's sort of like, well, I got enough animes for a while.

238
00:13:03,261 --> 00:13:05,818
Scott: Don't really need more animes any time soon.

239
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,740
Rym: Alright, even though there's... I've seen all these movies because I don't need to see movies anymore.

240
00:13:11,061 --> 00:13:11,342
Scott: I am.

241
00:13:11,463 --> 00:13:15,840
Scott: I'm also watching a lot of movies lately, but not animes.

242
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,720
Rym: So anyway, you got any news or anything?

243
00:13:19,502 --> 00:13:20,968
Scott: It's a tiny news and it's funny.

244
00:13:20,988 --> 00:13:23,500
Scott: you mention Yoko Kanno because she's involved in this news, right?

245
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:30,580
Scott: Uniqlo is a clothing store and apparently they do stuff that really has nothing to do with clothing also.

246
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:36,020
Scott: There's like five different Uniqlo iPhone apps and only like two of them have anything to do with clothing.

247
00:13:36,722 --> 00:13:39,499
Scott: But they just came out with a new one called Uniqlo Wake Up.

248
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:43,200
Scott: And actually what this is, is it's an alarm clock that wakes you up.

249
00:13:43,441 --> 00:13:45,099
Scott: And you might think, what the fuck, why do I need that?

250
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,003
Scott: Right?

251
00:13:46,246 --> 00:13:47,320
Scott: It's also for Android apparently.

252
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,999
Scott: Uh, why do I need that?

253
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,039
Scott: The iPhone and Android both have alarm clocks.

254
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,118
Scott: This is dumb.

255
00:13:54,121 --> 00:13:57,220
Scott: Well, what this does, it's different than a regular alarm clock.

256
00:13:58,301 --> 00:14:06,378
Scott: Is it wakes you up and it actually speaks and tells you, you know, like what the... What the temperature is and what the weather's gonna be.

257
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,419
Rym: Old people watches can do that.

258
00:14:09,383 --> 00:14:11,420
Scott: And it also, it plays a little happy music.

259
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:18,560
Scott: And the music varies depending on factors such as weather and temperature and what day it is and all that kind of stuff.

260
00:14:19,081 --> 00:14:23,180
Scott: So it's not like, you know, normally with my, you know, iPhone alarm clock what wakes me up?

261
00:14:24,123 --> 00:14:26,480
Scott: Eh, eh, eh, get the fuck up, eh, right?

262
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,999
Scott: With this it was like, ah, waking up.

263
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:35,420
Scott: And then the other thing is that it's actually, you know, when you got that iPhone alarm, right?

264
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,280
Scott: There's a pop up that you push a button on it to turn it off immediately.

265
00:14:39,001 --> 00:14:42,920
Scott: With this, you actually have to open the app and go into it to turn it off.

266
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:46,340
Scott: So it's actually slightly more difficult to disable.

267
00:14:47,402 --> 00:14:51,100
Scott: Uh, so it's a better waker upper that is also less grading.

268
00:14:52,381 --> 00:14:56,100
Scott: And it's, Yoko Kanno did all that, you know, variable kind of music in it.

269
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,918
Scott: I think she collaborated with someone on it.

270
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,439
Scott: Uh, Keigo Oyamada and Yoko Kanno.

271
00:15:03,205 --> 00:15:04,019
Scott: Those are the two people.

272
00:15:04,492 --> 00:15:04,780
Rym: Alright.

273
00:15:05,461 --> 00:15:10,540
Scott: So, you can wake up pleasantly with this app that was made for free by a clothing store.

274
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,560
Rym: You know, we're not talking about, in the second half, obscure anime that no one remembers.

275
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:22,020
Rym: But, uh, to this day, anytime someone says the words, "Wake up," I just immediately hear that song from Gokudo.

276
00:15:22,284 --> 00:15:22,680
Scott: I know, right?

277
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,319
Rym: Wake up, wake up, wake up.

278
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:24,773
Scott: Yep.

279
00:15:26,862 --> 00:15:30,940
Rym: And one last little bit, because the anime industry in America is, uh, amazing.

280
00:15:31,804 --> 00:15:33,260
Scott: You know, I just want to point out, right?

281
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:38,399
Scott: We've mentioned many times in this show, in the early episodes of GeekNights, we're all, "Nintendo, Nintendo, Nintendo, PC's

282
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:38,620
Scott: dead."

283
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:42,300
Scott: And now, the current episodes, obviously, that's no longer the case.

284
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,780
Scott: But it's funny how, anime industry down the shitter, really, the story hasn't changed.

285
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:54,380
Rym: Well, particularly in America, because, Mike Tool tweeted this, if you missed it, I'll talk about it briefly.

286
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:04,940
Rym: Basically, Media Blasters, uh, appeared officially dissolved, as far as the state of New York was concerned, as of April of 2011.

287
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,592
Rym: So, Anime News Network had a story that was like, "Yeah, check this out.

288
00:16:09,575 --> 00:16:10,097
Rym: Dissolved.

289
00:16:10,638 --> 00:16:11,019
Rym: Wonder what's

290
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,180
Rym: up.".

291
00:16:11,241 --> 00:16:12,579
Rym: We tried to call them, they didn't respond.

292
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,340
Scott: I've seen them at conventions, though.

293
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:21,980
Rym: Yeah, yeah, so, there was a response from a gentleman, on behalf of Media Blasters, in their forum.

294
00:16:22,562 --> 00:16:26,980
Rym: And it is him losing his shit, in an unprofessional way, about this whole story.

295
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,071
Scott: Uh-huh.

296
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:40,681
Rym: It appears that what really happened had to do with them not having actually filed their taxes, and instead had filed extensions, for, like, 2009, 2010, and 2011.

297
00:16:40,681 --> 00:16:45,260
Rym: But, eventually, because they kept filing extensions, something happened, and now they have to get caught up on all this paperwork.

298
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:50,100
Rym: And, it's basically the kind of stuff that happens to every, like, small or poorly run company.

299
00:16:50,923 --> 00:16:56,040
Rym: And, I know the anime industry is run primarily in the US by people who really are passionate about anime.

300
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,880
Rym: May not be super business savvy.

301
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,440
Rym: But, you gotta be at least a little bit professional.

302
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,211
Rym: And, if you screw up like this, it's fine.

303
00:17:04,412 --> 00:17:06,079
Rym: It's okay if you screw up like this.

304
00:17:06,641 --> 00:17:11,800
Rym: I've been late on so many stupid tax filings for the sales tax crap I had to do for that GeekNights store.

305
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:12,742
Rym: But, you know what?

306
00:17:13,143 --> 00:17:13,806
Rym: I dealt with it.

307
00:17:14,107 --> 00:17:17,940
Rym: I didn't freak out publicly in a forum about it, on behalf of GeekNights.

308
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:22,095
Scott: Yeah, it makes you look like, you know, it doesn't instill a lot of confidence.

309
00:17:22,194 --> 00:17:23,460
Scott: It makes you look like a moron.

310
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:28,020
Scott: Well, I guess it exposes the reality that you are a moron, right?

311
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:28,823
Rym: Maybe not a moron.

312
00:17:28,863 --> 00:17:32,618
Rym: Maybe just you're not, you don't know business that well, or you can't keep your cool, you can't...

313
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,179
Scott: It comes down to... It exposes the truth.

314
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:41,039
Scott: If you... But, then again, if that's the truth, then you are also incapable of concealing it.

315
00:17:41,581 --> 00:17:54,800
Rym: It's specifically that if you respond to a story like this, the way that this thread went, officially, or on behalf of your small company, it just proves that you can't, even if you're not professional, you can't even act like a professional.

316
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,400
Rym: And, stuff like this is why we have such a low opinion of the anime industry in the US.

317
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:08,120
Scott: Well, you know, we always talk about how we're so, we don't like big companies and how corporate and shut up and boring they are, right?

318
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:08,568
Rym: You say that.

319
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:09,059
Rym: I don't care.

320
00:18:09,466 --> 00:18:09,779
Scott: I care.

321
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:17,800
Rym: I actually prefer having a faceless corporate landlord because they give me way less trouble than unprofessional local dude landlord ever did.

322
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,220
Scott: Well, no, no, no, but I mean like, you know, you ask a company a question, right?

323
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,150
Scott: And the question, and they're like, "No comment.

324
00:18:23,391 --> 00:18:24,678
Scott: We cannot say anything at this

325
00:18:24,718 --> 00:18:25,020
Scott: time."

326
00:18:25,161 --> 00:18:26,173
Scott: Instead of just like, "Listen,

327
00:18:26,213 --> 00:18:26,497
Scott: dudes.".

328
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,780
Rym: Yeah, but we don't want actually answering and then flipping out like some kid on a forum.

329
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,300
Rym: You know, we want everything to be run the way Penny Arcade is run.

330
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,280
Scott: Right, we want everything to be right down the middle.

331
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:40,980
Scott: You just talk to us like normal, respectable human beings.

332
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:48,580
Scott: You don't be all corporate and uptight, not saying anything so that you, you know, like a robot where we can't even believe that you're a person.

333
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,440
Rym: Scott, name any significant company other than the Penny Arcade Corporation.

334
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,879
Scott: Even Penny Arcade keeps secrets and such.

335
00:18:55,243 --> 00:18:55,640
Rym: Like what?

336
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:58,759
Scott: I mean, do you know, they're up to something right now.

337
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,550
Scott: Where is there going to be third packs?

338
00:19:00,591 --> 00:19:01,700
Scott: Where is it going to be, right?

339
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,520
Scott: This whispers, but they don't say what they're thinking.

340
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,400
Rym: Because they haven't decided yet, probably.

341
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,700
Scott: Of course, but, you know, they could include us in the conversation.

342
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,141
Rym: Why?

343
00:19:10,403 --> 00:19:12,440
Rym: I don't care to be included in the conversation.

344
00:19:12,827 --> 00:19:13,319
Rym: I wouldn't mind.

345
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,382
Rym: I don't think it's a big deal.

346
00:19:14,402 --> 00:19:22,040
Rym: I mean, I don't involve the listeners in, you know, my planning of a trip to Turkey and whether or not that's going to influence a week of GeekNights being on or not.

347
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,520
Scott: Or, you know, what we're- They're not giving us money.

348
00:19:25,561 --> 00:19:29,040
Rym: Yeah, I've never actually given Penny Arcade money.

349
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:29,920
Scott: Ever?

350
00:19:30,483 --> 00:19:31,599
Rym: I don't think I ever have.

351
00:19:32,341 --> 00:19:32,825
Scott: Not once.

352
00:19:32,926 --> 00:19:34,480
Scott: You bought Penny Arcade packs t-shirts.

353
00:19:35,181 --> 00:19:36,288
Rym: Okay, I bought one Penny.

354
00:19:36,348 --> 00:19:38,480
Rym: I bought a PAX t-shirt at two PAXes.

355
00:19:39,505 --> 00:19:40,159
Scott: It's 40 bucks.

356
00:19:40,963 --> 00:19:42,915
Rym: Yup, but I've never paid for a PAX badge.

357
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:46,920
Scott: I've never- You have bought any Penny Arcade merchandise at any time in your life other than those two t-shirts.

358
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,559
Rym: I never actually paid you for the Penny Arcade books you got me.

359
00:19:50,201 --> 00:19:51,439
Scott: Did I get you Penny Arcade books?

360
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,771
Rym: Yeah, it's part of the DCVS thing.

361
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,520
Rym: It's part of that long running tab.

362
00:19:56,323 --> 00:19:57,248
Scott: Sure.

363
00:19:58,616 --> 00:19:59,018
Scott: Alrighty.

364
00:20:00,142 --> 00:20:01,280
Scott: So, they don't owe me anything.

365
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:15,800
Scott: The point is, I just want you to treat your customers, act professionally while simultaneously showing your customers, or at least being really convincing, that you actually are engaging your customers and taking them seriously.

366
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,575
Scott: Don't do what the White House petitions do, right?

367
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,200
Rym: Which is nothing.

368
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,480
Scott: Exactly, right?

369
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:33,392
Scott: Actually make us believe that if you're gonna pretend to have a conversation with us and talk to your customers, don't just, you know, sort of pretend to.

370
00:20:33,452 --> 00:20:34,638
Scott: You have to actually do.

371
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,640
Scott: And even if you don't do what we say, which would be nice if you did some of what we asked, right?

372
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:47,310
Scott: At least, you know, if not all, at least, you know, don't just, you know, be quiet and be like, or freak out.

373
00:20:48,743 --> 00:20:49,900
Scott: You guys don't know nothing.

374
00:20:51,401 --> 00:21:01,300
Scott: You know, you gotta find that in between normal person dialogue so that, you know, we at least can respect you and you can respect us as human beings or we can believe that you're respecting us as human beings.

375
00:21:01,701 --> 00:21:06,179
Rym: But if you have to be one of the two, I'd rather you be faceless corporate than- Than crazy guy, yeah.

376
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,980
Rym: Than posting in the anime news network forums.

377
00:21:10,464 --> 00:21:11,018
Scott: That's for sure.

378
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,318
Rym: So things of the day!

379
00:21:19,358 --> 00:21:27,070
Rym: It's anime day, it's a Wednesday, talking a little bit about anime, so I figured I would pull the old anime music video thing of the day.

380
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:38,070
Rym: Because back in the day, when AMVs were still, not everyone could make them, and I used to actually go to AMV contests at cons because there wasn't really YouTube like we have it now.

381
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:41,750
Scott: So you had no things of the day and all you could think of was the search for a music video that was old?

382
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:53,489
Rym: Actually, no, I got a bunch of things of the day, but I specifically thought to look for an anime music video that was from a show that was way popular in American fandom and then was mostly forgotten by now.

383
00:21:54,512 --> 00:21:56,530
Rym: And I didn't know of any good Ranma ones.

384
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:05,107
Rym: I knew of a good Karakano one because that would have fit, but that video was actually super long and doesn't really live up to modern sensibilities.

385
00:22:05,127 --> 00:22:05,429
Rym: that well.

386
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:10,090
Rym: But this Escaflowne video is great primarily because it uses Megadeth.

387
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,410
Scott: That's a good choice.

388
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,447
Rym: Spoilers for Escaflowne.

389
00:22:14,175 --> 00:22:14,830
Scott: Sure, whatever.

390
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,430
Rym: It is, it's a pretty big spoiler.

391
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,495
Rym: But it's a weird spoiler.

392
00:22:18,515 --> 00:22:25,537
Rym: It's not a plot spoiler, it's like- Or you're just gonna be thinking, "What the fuck?

393
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:26,380
Rym: Really?

394
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,206
Rym: That's what happens in

395
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:28,748
Rym: Escaflowne?".

396
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:30,429
Rym: It's a pretty good video.

397
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:40,169
Scott: So, you may not know this, or you may, but it is currently the 20th anniversary of one of the best games, Wolfenstein 3D.

398
00:22:41,091 --> 00:22:43,609
Rym: I was never a big fan and I didn't get into FPSs until Doom.

399
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,430
Scott: We know that you hate treasure and you love Nazis, right?

400
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:50,350
Scott: But I like collecting treasure and killing Nazis, so I like this game.

401
00:22:51,031 --> 00:22:53,210
Scott: And I'm playing it right now with the sound off.

402
00:22:53,951 --> 00:22:54,916
Scott: Yeah, Freund Leven.

403
00:22:55,378 --> 00:22:56,182
Scott: Oh shit, I don't even have the-.

404
00:22:56,403 --> 00:22:57,167
Scott: Oh shit, I got the knife.

405
00:22:57,248 --> 00:22:57,670
Scott: Oh snap.

406
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,174
Scott: Uh oh, uh oh.

407
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,810
Scott: Anyway, so you should play this game.

408
00:23:02,571 --> 00:23:04,450
Rym: It's just a maze game with some mediocre shooting.

409
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:11,490
Rym: And while it was revolutionary for being effectively the first popular modern FPS, it wasn't really an FPS at all.

410
00:23:12,211 --> 00:23:14,143
Rym: Doom was the real revolution.

411
00:23:14,163 --> 00:23:15,470
Scott: Doom 1.

412
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:19,010
Scott: Anyway, so if you want to play this game, which you should, right?

413
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:23,010
Scott: You could buy it on Steam for a very low price with all the expansions and everything, right?

414
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,725
Scott: But there's also the shareware, which is just episode one.

415
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:29,090
Scott: But you don't want to play that old shareware version, right?

416
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:35,230
Scott: What you want to do, because you might be unsophisticated, is you want to go to this website here.

417
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:41,150
Scott: Because it is now, because it's the anniversary, you can play this in your web browser.

418
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:45,270
Scott: All episodes one, two, and three in the web browser.

419
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:48,950
Scott: I recommend you read the instructions if you can't figure out the controls.

420
00:23:49,693 --> 00:23:53,430
Scott: It should be good for you people who don't have problems with the motion sickness.

421
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,450
Scott: Because there's no up and down, there's only left and right, and forward and back.

422
00:23:58,213 --> 00:23:59,379
Scott: And you can kill Nazis.

423
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:01,190
Scott: And it's awesome.

424
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:08,090
Rym: So in the meta moment, this weekend, Friday and Saturday, is ZenkaiCon, a convention in Pennsylvania.

425
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:15,808
Rym: We'll be there doing a panel about Dubrow, the Dubrow from My Shit is Fucked Up So I Have to Shoot/Slice You Too.

426
00:24:15,868 --> 00:24:16,730
Rym: It's Straight Up Dog Time.

427
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:18,590
Rym: And My Little Pony.

428
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:19,726
Scott: And Nazis.

429
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,278
Rym: We are also doing...

430
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,423
Scott: I mean, God Wends Law, right?

431
00:24:26,463 --> 00:24:27,009
Scott: We can't avoid it.

432
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:32,369
Rym: Doing motivational anime, which you may have seen at Anime Boston, where we also did it.

433
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,078
Rym: After that, Otakon is coming up.

434
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,390
Rym: It's up to them if we appear there.

435
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:40,169
Rym: Because we submitted panels, as we do every year.

436
00:24:40,751 --> 00:24:43,810
Rym: And we were accepted every year, up until they decided they hated us.

437
00:24:44,293 --> 00:24:46,709
Rym: So, if you want us to be there, tell them.

438
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:51,930
Rym: ConnectiCon is coming up, we will be there, running the panels department, and doing a bunch of our own stuff.

439
00:24:52,552 --> 00:24:56,950
Rym: And, it's looking pretty good that Dave Riley is going to come and do some stuff too.

440
00:24:57,452 --> 00:24:58,970
Scott: Oh shit son, it's on now.

441
00:24:59,871 --> 00:25:01,176
Rym: I'm legit excited about that.

442
00:25:01,437 --> 00:25:04,750
Rym: Fast Karate is one of the only podcasts I listen to.

443
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,763
Scott: I just stopped listening to it, but I do not dislike it.

444
00:25:08,004 --> 00:25:09,150
Scott: In fact, I like it a great deal.

445
00:25:09,411 --> 00:25:11,210
Scott: I just stopped listening to it, I don't know why.

446
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,790
Rym: You should listen to that Grimrock episode.

447
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:13,970
Scott: What is Grimrock?

448
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:17,289
Rym: That's that game we were talking about a few days ago.

449
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:18,788
Scott: Well, I never even heard of it.

450
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:21,590
Rym: With the boss that was weird.

451
00:25:22,532 --> 00:25:24,390
Scott: How many games have weird bosses, like all of them?

452
00:25:24,671 --> 00:25:25,882
Rym: The one that was crazy weird.

453
00:25:26,043 --> 00:25:26,729
Rym: It was a giant cube.

454
00:25:28,173 --> 00:25:29,310
Scott: Oh, that one!

455
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,408
Scott: Spoilers, I guess.

456
00:25:32,855 --> 00:25:34,109
Scott: I remember this conversation now.

457
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:37,870
Rym: And the Penny Arcade Expo Prime will probably be there doing stuff.

458
00:25:38,273 --> 00:25:39,924
Rym: And PAX Dev was announced.

459
00:25:39,985 --> 00:25:40,750
Rym: It's actually happening.

460
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:42,910
Rym: Though, they just took a wild update to the website.

461
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:46,409
Rym: There's a decent chance at least one of us will be there.

462
00:25:47,552 --> 00:25:48,580
Rym: And everything else can wait.

463
00:25:48,621 --> 00:25:49,830
Rym: We don't have that many important announcements.

464
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:52,890
Scott: Remember to go find us on the internet with all our internet things.

465
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,660
Scott: The book club is 1Q84 by Haruki Murakami.

466
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:01,950
Rym: A bunch of our panels, lectures, workshops and such are on my YouTube channel.

467
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:02,789
Rym: You can just watch them.

468
00:26:03,131 --> 00:26:07,124
Scott: Also, Google has a new hangout with on the air mode.

469
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,150
Scott: We're gonna start using it.

470
00:26:11,311 --> 00:26:13,901
Scott: Basically, it's like a Skype killer and a Ustream killer.

471
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:18,449
Rym: Yeah, watch out kids.

472
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:25,148
Scott: If you wanna know what's going on with that, what you gotta do is you gotta get on Google+, even though you might be hating on it.

473
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:26,655
Scott: And you gotta follow GeekNights.

474
00:26:30,033 --> 00:26:35,068
Scott: There's actually a GeekNights page on Google+ that you can follow and add to your Google+-ness.

475
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:39,770
Rym: Now, if you really don't want to, it looks like we can just stream this straight to YouTube as well.

476
00:26:41,312 --> 00:26:49,449
Rym: We're either gonna make a dedicated YouTube account just for this, or we're gonna use my GeekNights Rym account because that's where every other video is.

477
00:26:49,690 --> 00:27:05,169
Scott: Right, but the point is that there's going to be, you know, if you follow us on the internet, then you will be able to get these YouTube links to watch these streams and also records of any hangout on the air stuff we may do.

478
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:16,930
Rym: And we'll get right to it, but one last thing I do want to point out, because people don't seem to realize this, every episode of GeekNights going all the way back to October 31, 2005 is available on our website.

479
00:27:17,371 --> 00:27:19,429
Rym: Every single one, you can download all of them.

480
00:27:20,834 --> 00:27:22,849
Rym: And there's like 800-something episodes up there.

481
00:27:23,551 --> 00:27:27,209
Rym: So if you ask us to do a show on a thing, at least search the website.

482
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,238
Rym: There's a decent chance.

483
00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:28,704
Rym: we did it.

484
00:27:30,331 --> 00:27:39,130
Rym: And if you're lucky, you might be able to find another 10 or so episodes of Beta GeekNights that are also on the internet and actually pretty easy to find if you know where to look.

485
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:47,210
Scott: One last meta thing, very quick, BarCamp NYC 7 is June 9, 2012 in the Microsoft offices.

486
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:51,790
Scott: You want to go to, I think, barcampnyc.org to get all the info about that.

487
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:54,330
Scott: I'm helping to organize it for the second year in a row.

488
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,410
Scott: It's awesome.

489
00:27:56,030 --> 00:28:00,469
Scott: If you are a technology person near New York City, you should be there.

490
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:01,225
Scott: It's free.

491
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:07,910
Rym: So a long time ago, we'd go to anime cons like OhioCon and Anime Central and Otakon.

492
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,323
Rym: We're talking like a decade ago, 2002 era.

493
00:28:12,632 --> 00:28:16,270
Rym: And that was around the gigantic boom in American anime fans.

494
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,209
Scott: It wasn't really until '04-ish, but yeah.

495
00:28:19,391 --> 00:28:26,410
Rym: You forget there was a pre-boom there where the cons were getting big and Suncoast and all these places were selling VHS like crazy.

496
00:28:27,031 --> 00:28:28,310
Rym: DVDs were starting to get sold more and more.

497
00:28:28,371 --> 00:28:28,939
Scott: Yeah, that was '03-'04.

498
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,410
Rym: No, Suncoast was selling VHS well before that.

499
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:40,250
Scott: Well, yeah, but I'm saying the height of the boom, the height, the peak, the climax was a year or two later.

500
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,950
Rym: Yeah, but this was during this huge anime bubble.

501
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:43,409
Rym: It was.

502
00:28:43,811 --> 00:28:44,928
Scott: It was on the ramp up.

503
00:28:46,294 --> 00:28:46,810
Rym: All right, anyway.

504
00:28:47,231 --> 00:28:51,949
Rym: So in this era, go to any anime con, go talk to any anime fan.

505
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,450
Rym: And it was all like Ranma.

506
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,349
Rym: They knew Ranma and Fushigi Yugi.

507
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:02,030
Rym: There were these shows that just like people, everybody knew you'd see so many people cosplaying as them.

508
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:02,950
Rym: It was ridiculous.

509
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,750
Scott: Yeah, there were things that were crazy popular.

510
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:12,110
Scott: And it seems that now you talk to the modern anime fans, you know, and it's like people don't even remember.

511
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,410
Scott: Old school people know them, right?

512
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:21,770
Scott: You know, but even then, they're not occupying a large space in the mind share of the old school people necessarily.

513
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:28,489
Rym: But then again, what is occupying a large share of the mind scape in anime conventions today?

514
00:29:30,651 --> 00:29:32,110
Rym: Homestuck, video games.

515
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,047
Scott: Portal and Homestuck.

516
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:55,950
Rym: I mean, not to go down that whole separate discussion of what an anime con should or should not be or any of that stuff, but there was definitely a very surprisingly homogenous fan base in that the people who were in the anime subculture or were watching a lot of anime had all seen mostly the same shows, at least among the big shows.

517
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:58,089
Rym: Like, everyone had seen Ranma and knew what it was.

518
00:29:58,531 --> 00:29:59,790
Rym: Everyone saw Fushigi Yugi.

519
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:02,349
Rym: Everybody cosplayed as Ranma and Fushigi Yugi.

520
00:30:03,191 --> 00:30:09,210
Rym: And I remember when Fullmetal Alchemist was airing, people were going crazy about it.

521
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:13,669
Rym: Everyone was cosplaying as-- it was the exact same thing in the exact same manner.

522
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:19,189
Rym: And I remember saying often in panels and lectures, and even just talking to people, that it was the same thing.

523
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:24,189
Rym: And the argument I would usually get is no, Ranma's crap, or whatever show I was talking about was crap.

524
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,830
Rym: Fullmetal Alchemist is a show for the ages.

525
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:27,837
Rym: It is forever.

526
00:30:27,857 --> 00:30:29,310
Rym: It is the best show ever.

527
00:30:30,612 --> 00:30:34,790
Rym: And if Brotherhood did not come out, Fullmetal Alchemist, I think, would be completely forgotten by this point.

528
00:30:35,676 --> 00:30:37,048
Scott: I think it's forgotten, right?

529
00:30:37,512 --> 00:30:38,468
Scott: People remember it.

530
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,469
Scott: So it doesn't really fit into this category.

531
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:45,449
Rym: I mean, people who saw it remember it.

532
00:30:45,771 --> 00:30:55,290
Rym: But think about how many of the people at anime cons now, ten years after when we started going, are younger and never even saw it when it was popular.

533
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:58,890
Rym: Their first con was after its peak of popularity.

534
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:05,190
Scott: Yeah, I still think that was a show that was on Cartoon Network during the boomiest period.

535
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:12,050
Scott: Therefore, I think it's not-- It doesn't qualify, really, as a show that was a hit and is now forgotten.

536
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:17,930
Scott: It just was a hit and is now not as popular, but it's not a show that's forgotten, right?

537
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:23,950
Scott: Forgotten is like, you know, no one even talks about it anymore, but it used to be all over the place.

538
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:29,197
Scott: Like, imagine if ten years from now you went to a, you know, and it's just like, "Naruto?

539
00:31:29,418 --> 00:31:29,579
Scott: What?

540
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,025
Scott: Oh, I remember that.

541
00:31:31,126 --> 00:31:31,929
Scott: Whoa.".

542
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,210
Rym: Well, Scott, here's the problem with what you're saying.

543
00:31:34,591 --> 00:31:36,810
Rym: So that's probably just a function of time.

544
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,750
Scott: Well, you know, it's a degree, right?

545
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,070
Scott: And how can you even measure it, right?

546
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:45,810
Scott: The degree of how popular it was at the beginning compared to the degree of how much it has been forgotten.

547
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:51,269
Scott: Clearly, Fullmetal Alchemist has been forgotten to a, you know, medium, if not large, degree.

548
00:31:51,910 --> 00:32:03,349
Rym: But, you know, there are many, many other shows that weren't-- But it's also been much less time, and I am 100% sure-- Give it five more years, and Fullmetal Alchemist will be well on its way to Fushigi Yugi levels.

549
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,020
Scott: Quite possible.

550
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:05,750
Scott: Quite possible.

551
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:06,276
Rym: I would bet money.

552
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:08,568
Rym: I would bet a lot of money if anyone was willing to take that bet.

553
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,350
Scott: If you're counting the first one, it's quite possible.

554
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:11,426
Rym: Even the second one.

555
00:32:12,214 --> 00:32:12,506
Scott: It's possible.

556
00:32:12,651 --> 00:32:13,288
Rym: I'm pretty sure.

557
00:32:14,972 --> 00:32:18,109
Rym: So we want to talk a little bit about those shows that-- I bet against you.

558
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:23,510
Rym: --had their day in the sun in America in popular, like, anime fandom culture.

559
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:29,748
Rym: Like, the shows that, you know, if you said, like, you didn't know what the show was, or hadn't seen it, people would look at you weird.

560
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:36,735
Rym: Like, people would be really surprised if, you know, back in, like, 2003, if you were like, "Kotocha?

561
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:37,140
Rym: Child's Toy?

562
00:32:37,161 --> 00:32:37,545
Rym: What the hell's

563
00:32:37,586 --> 00:32:37,809
Rym: that?".

564
00:32:38,112 --> 00:32:50,107
Scott: Right, it's like, you'd go to the anime club library back in the day, like, the early 2000s, and you'd look through, and, you know, it's sort of like my brain would sort of categorize shows into "shows people know and shows people don't know," right?

565
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:54,910
Scott: So, you know, shows people knew would be those popular ones.

566
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,370
Scott: Like, Rama, people know that show.

567
00:32:56,592 --> 00:32:57,570
Scott: Kaibiba, people know that show.

568
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:58,750
Scott: Evangelion, people know that show.

569
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:02,349
Scott: But then you'd see, like, you know, Kishinko, it's like, people don't know that show.

570
00:33:03,013 --> 00:33:03,317
Rym: K.O.

571
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,150
Rym: Century Beast.

572
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:05,449
Scott: People don't know that show.

573
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:05,798
Scott: Kuu.

574
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,250
Scott: People don't know that show.

575
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,689
Rym: No, we gotta do a show on that show.

576
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:09,829
Scott: Yeah, we had to find it.

577
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:10,567
Rym: I know, I'll get it.

578
00:33:11,431 --> 00:33:15,730
Scott: You know, so it's like, you would look through, and that was sort of the two most broad categories.

579
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,529
Scott: Shows people knew, shows people don't know.

580
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:25,930
Scott: But what's happened is, since then, you know, a lot of those shows people knew, right, have moved to the shows people don't know.

581
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,850
Rym: Now, you could argue this is just a function of time.

582
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:28,448
Scott: Even though I know them.

583
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:39,610
Rym: Because, you know, shows are stupidly popular and then fade from memory, and this is why, whenever we do one of those, like, C-equivalent panels, where we list a bunch of shows and tell people why they should or should not watch them.

584
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,109
Rym: You know, it's an easy thing to do in a con.

585
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:57,230
Rym: But look, but when we do it, we're very careful to always point out that we don't talk about a lot of recent shows, and we don't talk about them because it's very difficult to gauge how much staying power a show really has when you just watched it.

586
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:02,348
Rym: I mean, I loved the ever-living shit out of Fushigi Yugi when I was watching it.

587
00:34:03,113 --> 00:34:08,527
Rym: And Lodos War, when I was, you know, a little kid, I thought that was one of the greatest things ever made by man.

588
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:12,170
Scott: Um, they don't all up that well.

589
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,850
Scott: Well, it's not even a question of whether they're good or not.

590
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:19,409
Scott: It's just a question of somehow they've been, you know, not lost, like, we still have them.

591
00:34:19,831 --> 00:34:23,690
Scott: But it's like, no one talks about them anymore, even though they were highly talked about.

592
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:29,248
Scott: And I just, you know, look in other geekeries, I don't really see it happening so much.

593
00:34:29,772 --> 00:34:34,409
Rym: That's actually, I was thinking about this show after we decided to do it, and that's kind of the road I was going down.

594
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:34,975
Scott: Right?

595
00:34:35,034 --> 00:34:37,750
Scott: Look at, let's go through the geekeries just one at a time quickly, right?

596
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:40,270
Scott: So, superhero nerdy comic books, right?

597
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:43,409
Scott: The big ones of the olden days are still remembered.

598
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:46,050
Scott: Secret Wars, Watchmen, right?

599
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:47,078
Scott: Watchmen's from 1986, it's remembered, right?

600
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:55,110
Scott: Whether the new fans or the old fans, they don't let the old hits get forgotten.

601
00:34:55,411 --> 00:34:57,570
Rym: Now, remember, we're being very careful, old hits.

602
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:05,190
Rym: There's tons of obscure and/or crap comics that no one remembers, but they were never hugely popular to begin with.

603
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,390
Scott: Yeah, Crisis on, you know, Infinite Earth.

604
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,136
Scott: Guess what?

605
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:09,006
Scott: It's not lost.

606
00:35:10,072 --> 00:35:11,527
Rym: People still remember that shit.

607
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:16,369
Rym: Now, American comics kind of cheat in that, who was a really important superhero from 40 years ago?

608
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:17,545
Scott: Name one.

609
00:35:17,791 --> 00:35:17,940
Scott: Batman.

610
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:21,710
Rym: All right, so, they've still got Batman and Superman.

611
00:35:22,231 --> 00:35:22,610
Scott: Exactly, right.

612
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:26,930
Rym: I mean, imagine if Ranma was just, like, still going.

613
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:30,090
Scott: Then it wouldn't be forgotten, which is why, you know, look at Naruto in one piece.

614
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:33,090
Rym: Naruto was still going, but no one talked about it anymore.

615
00:35:33,651 --> 00:35:35,110
Scott: You mean, like, the Ama Goddess manga?

616
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:40,130
Rym: Yeah, like, imagine if, that's exactly the example I was going to use, I have to use a different one now.

617
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:54,570
Rym: Imagine if, you know, Batman just wasn't, like, there were still Batman movies, like there are now, but, like, no one really talked about him, and other than older comic fans and older, like, cinema buffs, no one really, like, knew much about Batman.

618
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,427
Rym: Like, they had heard of it, maybe, but they didn't know what it was.

619
00:35:57,961 --> 00:35:58,210
Rym: Yeah.

620
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:59,769
Rym: But yet, we kept making Batman movies.

621
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:03,349
Rym: I've found that James Bond is like that for a lot of punk kids.

622
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,770
Rym: A lot of punk kids have never actually seen James Bond.

623
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,648
Scott: They gotta get schooled by Dr.

624
00:36:08,688 --> 00:36:08,749
Scott: No.

625
00:36:10,018 --> 00:36:10,082
Scott: No.

626
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:11,390
Rym: I like Timothy Dalton.

627
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:11,727
Scott: Whatever.

628
00:36:12,674 --> 00:36:14,910
Scott: What James Bond movies was Timothy Dalton in?

629
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,890
Rym: He was in only one, right?

630
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:17,529
Rym: Live and Let Die?

631
00:36:17,956 --> 00:36:18,188
Scott: Nope.

632
00:36:18,417 --> 00:36:18,525
Scott: No?

633
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:19,289
Scott: That's Roger Moore.

634
00:36:19,674 --> 00:36:20,429
Rym: Oh, it was Roger Moore.

635
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:21,010
Rym: All right.

636
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:22,769
Scott: So, you don't even know.

637
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:25,750
Rym: Because I didn't actually see the entire Timothy Dalton one.

638
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:29,110
Rym: I saw it on cable during the James Bond marathon.

639
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:31,229
Scott: What even happens in the movie that he's in?

640
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:32,090
Rym: Fuck if I don't remember.

641
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:32,500
Rym: He was there.

642
00:36:32,771 --> 00:36:35,669
Scott: So, you're saying that he's great, and you don't even know a goddamn thing about it.

643
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,990
Rym: I was saying he was great because he's the one that everyone says is bad.

644
00:36:39,353 --> 00:36:39,788
Scott: He is bad.

645
00:36:39,951 --> 00:36:40,036
Scott: Yeah.

646
00:36:41,091 --> 00:36:45,630
Scott: Anyway, and I think he might have been in two and not one, but one that he was definitely in was License to Kill.

647
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:47,140
Scott: Anyway, I'm almost 100% sure of that.

648
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:53,349
Rym: All I know is the only time I ever saw him was during the marathon of all the James Bonds that happens every year.

649
00:36:53,854 --> 00:36:55,190
Rym: It was just on the TV in the background.

650
00:36:55,271 --> 00:36:58,828
Rym: I was sitting there playing a GBA, and that happened to be the one that was on.

651
00:36:59,050 --> 00:36:59,456
Rym: I was like, "Who's

652
00:36:59,477 --> 00:36:59,761
Rym: that?".

653
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:00,941
Rym: "Oh, that's James

654
00:37:00,982 --> 00:37:01,246
Rym: Bond.".

655
00:37:01,934 --> 00:37:03,043
Rym: "Oh, that's Timothy

656
00:37:03,063 --> 00:37:03,506
Rym: Dalton.".

657
00:37:04,315 --> 00:37:05,368
Scott: I was indeed correct.

658
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:07,570
Scott: License to Kill, Timothy Dalton.

659
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,250
Scott: IMDB rating, six and a half.

660
00:37:09,991 --> 00:37:11,050
Rym: That's higher than I would expect it is.

661
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,390
Scott: He was also in the Living Daylights.

662
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:12,987
Scott: He was in two.

663
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:14,303
Scott: So, I was 100% correct.

664
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:18,150
Scott: He was in two James Bond movies, both of which were not so good.

665
00:37:18,251 --> 00:37:18,462
Scott: All right.

666
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:22,770
Scott: So, anyway, let's go through some other geekery.

667
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:23,830
Scott: So, we covered comic books.

668
00:37:24,636 --> 00:37:24,950
Rym: Sports.

669
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:32,807
Rym: So, people still talk about the 1944 Cup, the Oilers, the Edmonton Oilers.

670
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:36,961
Scott: There was a thread on Reddit hockey, and they were like, "Best hockey

671
00:37:37,002 --> 00:37:37,349
Scott: moments."

672
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:37,928
Scott: And you know what?

673
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,950
Scott: The videos were coming from all eras.

674
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:43,570
Scott: You know, the geekery, the hockey geeks do not forget any hockey.

675
00:37:45,334 --> 00:37:46,330
Scott: Video games, right?

676
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:49,630
Scott: People have not forgotten The Legend of Zelda, right?

677
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:53,090
Scott: I mean, not a lot of people, you know, punk kids haven't played it when I talk to them.

678
00:37:53,293 --> 00:37:54,049
Scott: But they know what it is.

679
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,130
Scott: But they know it, right?

680
00:37:55,251 --> 00:37:58,390
Scott: Even if they haven't played Mario 1, which I'm pretty sure everyone's played Mario 1.

681
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:01,470
Rym: Dude, adventure is like part of pop nerd culture.

682
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:02,910
Scott: And it's not forgotten.

683
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,550
Scott: It's like, you know, how many people have played adventure?

684
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,524
Scott: You go around, but if you hold up the duck, people are like, "It's the

685
00:38:08,565 --> 00:38:08,788
Scott: duck.".

686
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:11,650
Rym: Now, Scott, there are- Even though it's a dragon.

687
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:14,129
Rym: Outlaw was a very popular game.

688
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:14,848
Scott: Relatively.

689
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:19,570
Rym: And it is completely forgotten, except by you, me, and the people who were at that PAX panel we ran.

690
00:38:20,371 --> 00:38:24,129
Scott: Yeah, well, I mean, you know, Kaboom was one of the top 10 selling Atari games, you know?

691
00:38:24,391 --> 00:38:26,350
Rym: And there's only- And no one knows that anymore.

692
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:28,470
Rym: Except for, like, hardcore video game people.

693
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,169
Scott: So there is a little- Even though I can't play.

694
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,650
Rym: There is some of that in video games.

695
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:37,310
Scott: Right, but the thing is, it's not the A- It is the thing, right?

696
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:41,630
Scott: The video games that were popular and forgotten weren't the A+ popular.

697
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:43,070
Scott: They were the A- popular.

698
00:38:43,151 --> 00:38:43,810
Scott: I'm gonna make a different point.

699
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:45,210
Scott: Or the B+ popular.

700
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:49,690
Rym: They were popular before an internet, which makes things very difficult.

701
00:38:51,132 --> 00:38:58,250
Rym: Because, you know, now we have so much access to stuff, but these anime that were forgotten, there was internet the entire time.

702
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:03,250
Scott: But the point is, video games that reached the peak level of popularity were not forgotten.

703
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,150
Rym: Super Mario Brothers.

704
00:39:04,536 --> 00:39:07,589
Scott: It was the ones that were- Dude, your grandma probably knows who Mario is.

705
00:39:07,671 --> 00:39:08,069
Scott: Exactly.

706
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:11,110
Scott: It's the ones that were popular for a short period.

707
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,590
Scott: Like, say, Primal Rage, right?

708
00:39:12,831 --> 00:39:19,328
Scott: Was very popular, but it was a flash in the pan, and thus was forgotten, except by people who remember the dinosaur fighting game.

709
00:39:20,005 --> 00:39:20,210
Scott: Right?

710
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:30,930
Scott: But in anime, these shows were A+ top popularity, at least in the US, among the fandom at the time.

711
00:39:31,373 --> 00:39:32,630
Scott: There was nothing more popular.

712
00:39:32,951 --> 00:39:38,270
Rym: I don't think you guys can understand how many Ranma ½ cosplayers and cosplay skits there were back then.

713
00:39:38,531 --> 00:39:41,950
Scott: It was the most popular thing in the US fandom.

714
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,988
Scott: There was nothing more popular than it.

715
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:47,210
Scott: It would be like if Portal was forgotten, right?

716
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:49,649
Scott: Portal is the most popular video game now.

717
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:51,926
Scott: Imagine if people forgot it in 10 years.

718
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:57,190
Rym: Yeah, if in 10 years, a guy cosplays as Portal, and one guy is like, "Oh my god, Portal.

719
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:58,360
Rym: Yeah, old

720
00:39:58,441 --> 00:39:58,967
Rym: school.".

721
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,849
Scott: Yeah, that's what it's like.

722
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,870
Scott: So, any other geekeries left?

723
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:04,430
Scott: We did comics, board games.

724
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,810
Scott: I guess it's sort of weird, right?

725
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:10,130
Scott: I mean, the mega hits are sort of never forgotten.

726
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:12,349
Rym: The idea of mega hits is relatively recent.

727
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:14,810
Scott: Yeah, but Settlers is still hanging around, right?

728
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:15,590
Scott: It's not going anywhere.

729
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:16,289
Rym: It's still well known.

730
00:40:16,391 --> 00:40:18,030
Rym: But then again, El Grande was really popular.

731
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:19,150
Rym: No one knows that.

732
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:20,809
Scott: But it wasn't A+ popular.

733
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:21,576
Rym: How do you know?

734
00:40:21,596 --> 00:40:22,350
Rym: You don't know the numbers.

735
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:24,070
Rym: You're just completely speculating.

736
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:27,049
Scott: It's not as popular as Settlers Carcassonne, which is still around.

737
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:29,530
Rym: Yeah, but it was when it was out.

738
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,770
Scott: And look how old Munchkin is.

739
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:34,490
Scott: We played that at RIT social night, and it's still hitting hard.

740
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,150
Scott: Magic the Gathering is still hitting hard.

741
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:38,910
Scott: At the same time, it's easy... Pokemon trading card games still hitting hard.

742
00:40:39,031 --> 00:40:40,850
Rym: It's easy to cherry pick these examples.

743
00:40:41,131 --> 00:40:41,236
Scott: It is.

744
00:40:41,911 --> 00:40:46,691
Scott: I mean, Magic the Gathering was popular, think of a board game that was super, super popular, A+.

745
00:40:46,732 --> 00:40:47,970
Scott: that is now forgotten.

746
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:50,650
Rym: See, you say A+, what exactly does that mean?

747
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:51,670
Rym: We don't have the numbers.

748
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:54,009
Scott: As in, it is the most popular thing at the time.

749
00:40:54,511 --> 00:40:54,997
Rym: Among who?

750
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:56,050
Rym: Just German gamers?

751
00:40:56,592 --> 00:40:57,450
Rym: Just board gamers?

752
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:00,230
Scott: Among people who care about that particular geekery.

753
00:41:00,874 --> 00:41:02,268
Rym: I think you're still cherry picking too much.

754
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:07,710
Scott: Even Ranma was the most popular among anime fans, but among the general populace, it was nothing.

755
00:41:07,975 --> 00:41:08,190
Scott: Yeah.

756
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,850
Scott: At least in the US, right?

757
00:41:10,095 --> 00:41:10,770
Scott: It was non-existent.

758
00:41:11,613 --> 00:41:14,789
Scott: So, you know, we're talking about among the geeks, the geeks have forgotten it.

759
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:18,350
Rym: Well, let's go through the animes first, then we'll get back to other examples.

760
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,109
Scott: I think we proved the point, though.

761
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:26,570
Scott: This really hasn't happened as obviously in the other geekeries as it has in anime for some reason.

762
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:27,690
Rym: Well, TV fandom.

763
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:35,290
Rym: People who talk about TV in, like, sitcom forums or whatever, they still talk about the Andy Griffith Show, I Love Lucy, I Love Lucy Has Not Died.

764
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:40,870
Rym: I've been watching the Andy Griffith Show every now and then on Netflix.

765
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,069
Scott: Well, that's your jam.

766
00:41:42,392 --> 00:41:42,770
Scott: You know what?

767
00:41:43,053 --> 00:41:44,528
Scott: It holds up pretty well.

768
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:45,301
Rym: It holds up.

769
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:50,370
Scott: I've watched an episode or two in somewhat recent years, and it holds up about halfway.

770
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:52,549
Rym: It holds up as well as, like, the Cosby Show.

771
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:53,910
Scott: Yeah, or the Flintstones.

772
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:57,150
Rym: Eh, Flintstones is better than the Jetsons.

773
00:41:58,437 --> 00:41:59,085
Scott: Uh, I mean...

774
00:41:59,672 --> 00:42:01,330
Rym: I hated the Jetsons as a kid.

775
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,709
Scott: They're sort of equal-ish.

776
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:03,749
Rym: I hated that family.

777
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:04,729
Rym: I hated Elroy.

778
00:42:05,776 --> 00:42:06,690
Rym: I watched it, but I didn't like them.

779
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:10,635
Scott: Yeah, I do admit that in the Jet-- I mean, the thing is, right, in the Jetsons, it's sort of like.

780
00:42:10,675 --> 00:42:14,890
Scott: I like all the future-y stuff, but, yeah, none of the characters are, like, really great.

781
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:19,710
Scott: You know, you don't really like any of them super much, and at least on the Flintstones, you really like Barney.

782
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,390
Scott: He's awesome.

783
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:24,470
Rym: Yep, and Fred would cause some trouble, but he'd cause trouble because he was headstrong.

784
00:42:24,571 --> 00:42:25,570
Scott: And Dino was pretty awesome.

785
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:28,110
Rym: Meanwhile, George Jetson caused trouble because he's a spineless twit.

786
00:42:28,371 --> 00:42:29,250
Scott: Yeah, anyway.

787
00:42:29,874 --> 00:42:30,170
Rym: Anyway.

788
00:42:31,631 --> 00:42:33,870
Rym: But, so, we keep saying Ranma.

789
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:35,267
Rym: There are a lot of shows like this.

790
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:36,829
Rym: Remember Fushigi Yugi?

791
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:37,350
Scott: Yep.

792
00:42:37,431 --> 00:42:38,349
Rym: How much of that did you watch?

793
00:42:39,032 --> 00:42:39,228
Scott: Really?

794
00:42:39,532 --> 00:42:42,630
Scott: But I knew enough about it because it was that popular, right?

795
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:43,970
Scott: You know, that I didn't even need it.

796
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:46,390
Scott: It was one of those shows-- That's how popular it was.

797
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:54,430
Scott: You don't even understand that without seeing a single episode, without watching it ever, I knew a significant amount about it just because it was that popular.

798
00:42:55,074 --> 00:42:55,968
Scott: You couldn't avoid it.

799
00:42:56,450 --> 00:43:02,129
Rym: I remember hanging out with two Miyake cosplayers at Anime Central 2000 and I think three?

800
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:08,447
Scott: This is when you go to your room and the craft store and you make the fastest-- Oh, my gosh, bro.

801
00:43:08,792 --> 00:43:10,609
Scott: That you can possibly make.

802
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:14,970
Scott: You did that once with the Oh My God Is Movie with your blue triangle, right?

803
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:15,469
Rym: Oh, my God.

804
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:17,262
Rym: So I took a piece with $3 in my wallet.

805
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:33,849
Rym: I went to, I think, Joanne Fabrics and I bought one square yard of blue felt and then I took a white sheet that we had been using as a curtain in our kitchen at RIT and I wrapped it around myself and wore white pants under it.

806
00:43:34,412 --> 00:43:40,670
Rym: I turned that piece of felt into the front half of this symbol and then I put something on my forehead.

807
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:47,270
Rym: But yeah, Fushigi Yugi was the jam back then to everybody.

808
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:48,884
Rym: And you know what, it's kind of a crappy--.

809
00:43:50,057 --> 00:43:50,869
Rym: It does not hold up.

810
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:53,128
Rym: It is like 90s-ish anime to a T.

811
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:56,810
Scott: I can't comment not having seen it or re-watched it, let alone watched it.

812
00:43:56,931 --> 00:44:06,805
Rym: I have no desire to re-watch it, but if you had asked anyone in anime fandom at that time, they would have said that Fushigi Yugi was a show for the ages that we will talk about for 50 years.

813
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:08,650
Scott: Well, could it be, right?

814
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:13,830
Scott: The one thing that sets the anime apart from these other geekeries is that it was an imported anime, right?

815
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:18,150
Scott: Is that it was, you know, these things, anime has already existed going back to Astro Boy.

816
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:18,941
Rym: Spaghetti Westerns.

817
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:21,690
Scott: That's true, right?

818
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:24,329
Scott: But I mean, you know, an imported geekery that we were involved in.

819
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:25,729
Rym: All right, so--.

820
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:34,570
Scott: And the point is, right, so as we've discussed many times, right, the anime that we got early on was they were cherry-picking the best stuff.

821
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:40,950
Scott: So we had this sort of false impression that the anime was all good when they were just leaving the crap in Japan.

822
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:53,030
Scott: But at the same time, they would bring over some animes that were not the best, and we would watch them and really, really like them because we didn't really have much to compare it to.

823
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:56,530
Scott: So any anime was awesome because what were you comparing it to, right?

824
00:44:56,931 --> 00:45:08,430
Scott: It was like if I had a closet full of food, and in there was like foie gras but also cheesecake, and I gave you cheesecake and you said that is the best tasting thing in the universe, and that's because you didn't even know the foie gras was in the closet, right?

825
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:09,989
Scott: You didn't even know it existed, right?

826
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:14,330
Scott: And then years later when everyone's eating foie gras, you've forgotten the cheesecake.

827
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:20,190
Rym: See, I would go with this except that I think the trend continues pretty much unabated.

828
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:21,173
Scott: Mmm.

829
00:45:21,872 --> 00:45:23,367
Rym: So I don't think that's the cause.

830
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:29,570
Scott: I think it is a factor on some of the shows because some of the shows, like say Fushigi Yugi, right?

831
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:34,509
Scott: They were liked in their day because, you know, you didn't have much to compare it to.

832
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:36,590
Rym: Well, like Lotoswar is I think a better example of that.

833
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:45,910
Rym: Lotoswar, to people who had seen, because Lotoswar was primarily picked up in America by people who had just watched like the sci-fi stuff.

834
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:47,530
Rym: They'd seen like Vampire Hunter.

835
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:53,129
Scott: And this was D&D to anime, so really compared to 70s D&D cartoon, oh shit son.

836
00:45:53,571 --> 00:45:59,129
Rym: I mean, kids who had just gotten into anime saw Lotoswar and it looked to them amazing.

837
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:03,069
Rym: And Deedlet was the most beautiful thing they had ever seen.

838
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:09,370
Rym: And like I remember I was desperate to see more of it because Blockbuster only had one VHS tape of it.

839
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:12,750
Scott: I remember I would go to the store and I would see this big row of VHS tapes.

840
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:15,209
Scott: There were a lot of them and I was like, "Whatever that is, I want to watch

841
00:46:15,269 --> 00:46:15,310
Scott: it.".

842
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:16,149
Scott: I didn't even know what it was.

843
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:17,876
Scott: And I never did.

844
00:46:17,896 --> 00:46:20,610
Scott: I only watched that OAV one that was on a single DVD.

845
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:30,727
Rym: I remember trying to convince my parents to buy... A DVD player when DVD had first come out because Lotoswar on VHS was like over $200 to get all of it.

846
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:39,190
Rym: The Boxset DVD, one of the first DVDs of anime to be released in the US as far as I can tell, was like $100.

847
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:45,947
Rym: I was like, "Mom, you'll save money if you just buy me a DVD player and that anime instead of buying me just the

848
00:46:46,027 --> 00:46:46,348
Rym: anime.".

849
00:46:48,213 --> 00:46:49,930
Rym: Except DVD players were still really expensive.

850
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:53,076
Scott: The thing is, people don't realize how recent DVD is.

851
00:46:53,096 --> 00:46:54,860
Scott: In 2001, which was 11 years ago, the PS2 was coming out.

852
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:01,887
Scott: We were at RIT.

853
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:06,645
Rym: And people were saying, "Oh man, if you get a PS2, it comes with a DVD player.

854
00:47:06,706 --> 00:47:07,669
Rym: Holy shit, you can watch

855
00:47:07,689 --> 00:47:07,769
Rym: DVDs.".

856
00:47:08,171 --> 00:47:12,729
Scott: It was 2000 or 2001 and we were like, "Holy shit, we gotta get that PS2 at the casino

857
00:47:12,789 --> 00:47:12,930
Scott: night.".

858
00:47:14,171 --> 00:47:17,890
Scott: And we put all our fake money together and put it all on black and lost.

859
00:47:18,671 --> 00:47:22,369
Scott: If we would have won, it would have come out black, we would have had a PS2 to share amongst us.

860
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:24,310
Rym: And then it would have been that episode of The Simpsons.

861
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:25,127
Scott: That's right.

862
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:28,736
Rym: We're getting off on a tangent of DVD players.

863
00:47:29,198 --> 00:47:33,030
Rym: I don't want to talk about that special DVD player we had.

864
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:40,620
Scott: But the idea is, some of these shows, the reason that they were super popular and forgotten is that they were incorrectly popular because...

865
00:47:48,712 --> 00:47:50,909
Rym: But now is like the third or fourth tallest at the park.

866
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:56,270
Scott: They are no longer the tallest rollercoaster and that is why they are not given as much attention as they used to be.

867
00:47:56,570 --> 00:48:02,850
Scott: But, some shows are actually the tallest rollercoaster and have been forgotten and are deserving of writing and attention.

868
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:03,633
Scott: Alright, so what's the show?

869
00:48:03,653 --> 00:48:06,003
Rym: that is an A anime that's been forgotten?

870
00:48:06,064 --> 00:48:07,450
Rym: I got a bunch, but what's your example?

871
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:10,650
Scott: Well, the one we just brought up was His and Her Circumstances, right?

872
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:12,570
Rym: Kare Kano, who remembers that?

873
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:15,603
Scott: I only watched half that show and it was the awesomest.

874
00:48:15,664 --> 00:48:16,970
Scott: I don't know why I didn't finish it.

875
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:18,557
Rym: I really liked it.

876
00:48:18,618 --> 00:48:19,063
Rym: That show...

877
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:21,670
Scott: That was like the Gainax show, right?

878
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:23,510
Rym: After, you know, Ava and that.

879
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:31,210
Scott: Yeah, but it's like, you know, people now, you talk about Gainax, they'll be talking about FLC, or you know, all this other stuff.

880
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:36,488
Rym: Not saying those shows aren't great, but Kare Kano, I don't think... I would wager if we were an anime con, maybe...

881
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:39,190
Scott: I think I might just go watch it and then we'll do a show on it.

882
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:41,790
Rym: Maybe one or two people will raise their hands if we brought up Kare Kano.

883
00:48:42,314 --> 00:48:43,102
Scott: Only the old school.

884
00:48:43,465 --> 00:48:43,909
Scott: No one else.

885
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:46,969
Rym: I mean, if we're talking about... I don't know if it was an A anime, though.

886
00:48:48,256 --> 00:48:48,420
Rym: A?

887
00:48:48,482 --> 00:48:50,490
Rym: Mmm... I think it's a B. I think it's a good B. I liked it.

888
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:51,079
Rym: I don't remember.

889
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:51,730
Rym: I gotta watch it again.

890
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:52,530
Rym: I'd have to watch it again.

891
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:56,090
Rym: Yeah, we did a show on why you have to watch it again before you judge it.

892
00:48:56,535 --> 00:48:57,089
Scott: Let's watch it again.

893
00:48:57,491 --> 00:48:58,150
Rym: Alright, alright.

894
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:02,130
Rym: But like, uh, Irresponsible Captain Tyler, I think it's A anime.

895
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:02,867
Scott: That's A for you.

896
00:49:03,794 --> 00:49:04,950
Rym: I think it's A for everyone.

897
00:49:05,172 --> 00:49:05,830
Scott: I gotta watch it again.

898
00:49:05,911 --> 00:49:06,940
Scott: You do.

899
00:49:07,061 --> 00:49:08,030
Rym: I will stand by it being A.

900
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:09,990
Scott: But that is most definitely forgotten.

901
00:49:10,312 --> 00:49:13,190
Rym: Scott, I'll bet you a hundred bucks that you will say it's A after you watch it.

902
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:14,327
Rym: Two hundred.

903
00:49:14,852 --> 00:49:15,050
Rym: Maybe.

904
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:15,670
Rym: Five hundred.

905
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:15,915
Rym: Sure.

906
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:17,590
Rym: Five thousand dollars.

907
00:49:17,911 --> 00:49:18,409
Scott: Okay, sure.

908
00:49:19,041 --> 00:49:19,209
Scott: Really?

909
00:49:19,732 --> 00:49:20,089
Scott: Whatever.

910
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:23,370
Rym: Actually, I don't want to take that bet because I'm a hundred percent sure you will.

911
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:24,019
Rym: Anyway.

912
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:29,250
Rym: But, um, I think there's a completely different factor here that I've been mulling over.

913
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:40,550
Rym: Anime fandom, more so than any other stereotypically geeky or nerdy fandom in the United States, has a ludicrously higher churn rate.

914
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:41,929
Rym: Or turnover rate.

915
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:45,109
Rym: I think more so than almost any other hobby in America right now.

916
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:58,068
Rym: People get into anime, go to anime cons, have this huge, like, anime sort of, like, honeymoon, and then get out of anime and stop going to anime cons and watch it occasionally on the internet.

917
00:49:58,088 --> 00:49:58,450
Rym: and that's it.

918
00:49:58,891 --> 00:50:00,630
Rym: Like, they disengage from the fan culture.

919
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:05,629
Rym: So I think the people do find, like, Ranma and watch it.

920
00:50:06,072 --> 00:50:08,770
Rym: But those people don't go to cons anymore so we never see them.

921
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:11,610
Rym: They don't participate in anime culture anymore so we don't talk to them.

922
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:23,850
Scott: Right, there is no question that there are a large number of people who read anime, who watch anime, or even sometimes read manga and comics and such, but they are not in that culture, right?

923
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:28,010
Scott: Walking Dead keeps selling trades like crazy non-stop.

924
00:50:28,751 --> 00:50:30,789
Scott: Those people are not comic book gang.

925
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:32,650
Rym: Oh yeah, but I'm making a separate point.

926
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:38,770
Scott: There are people at my work who, they watch an anime or two on the Hulu's and such, but are they anime fans?

927
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:40,258
Scott: Would they ever go to an anime con?

928
00:50:40,278 --> 00:50:42,410
Scott: Do they actually know anything about anime?

929
00:50:43,014 --> 00:50:43,710
Scott: Not really.

930
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:44,750
Rym: But I'm not talking about them.

931
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:46,560
Rym: I'm making a much more specific point.

932
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,250
Rym: that has, I think, deeper consequences.

933
00:50:48,871 --> 00:50:53,690
Rym: I think these are people who became self-identified anime fans.

934
00:50:53,951 --> 00:50:54,408
Scott: So they got in.

935
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:56,829
Scott: See, I was talking about the people who were never in.

936
00:50:57,110 --> 00:50:58,730
Rym: Yeah, yeah, I'm making a separate point.

937
00:50:58,911 --> 00:51:11,570
Rym: I'm saying there are people who started going to anime cons, got really into anime, but then as they continued to be into anime, they disengaged from anime fan culture for a variety of reasons.

938
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:14,741
Rym: So those people all eventually do fine.

939
00:51:14,781 --> 00:51:16,810
Rym: Ranma and all these other, you know...

940
00:51:16,911 --> 00:51:17,449
Scott: Well, they might.

941
00:51:17,932 --> 00:51:18,828
Rym: I think a lot of them do.

942
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:24,730
Rym: And also, the old comic book guy is still there at every comic con.

943
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:25,126
Rym: He is.

944
00:51:25,371 --> 00:51:29,970
Rym: But not nearly as many of the old anime guys are at every anime con.

945
00:51:30,339 --> 00:51:30,570
Scott: That's true.

946
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:52,008
Rym: So the avenues for new fans to discover the old things are less in anime because the people who would mentor them no longer engage with the fandom in a way that they would run into them, coupled with the fact that I've met a lot of people and seen a lot of people who self-identified as anime fans and then pointedly self-identified as no longer an anime

947
00:51:52,088 --> 00:51:52,410
Scott: fan.

948
00:51:53,713 --> 00:51:55,310
Scott: Even though they may watch anime still.

949
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:57,458
Rym: Yes, but they disengage.

950
00:51:57,499 --> 00:52:00,150
Rym: They don't want anything to do with anime culture, anime fandom.

951
00:52:00,411 --> 00:52:01,810
Rym: They just watch anime on their own.

952
00:52:02,171 --> 00:52:07,169
Scott: See, this is actually something else that's sort of unique to our particular situation, but you just sort of realized, right?

953
00:52:08,393 --> 00:52:11,410
Scott: Even though we were in that generation that saw anime on the sci-fi channel...

954
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:14,430
Rym: Dude, we ran the biggest anime club in North America for years.

955
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:25,970
Scott: I'm just saying, even though we were in the generation that watched on the sci-fi channel, we were not the true old school people who were watching Star Blazers and Robotech on UHF.

956
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:28,067
Scott: Those are the real old school U.S.

957
00:52:28,108 --> 00:52:28,330
Scott: people.

958
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:30,330
Scott: We were not there with a line of VCRs.

959
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:32,049
Rym: No, we were the next school.

960
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:33,210
Scott: We were the next school.

961
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:36,470
Rym: We were the end of the VHS fansubs, like SVHS days.

962
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:52,310
Scott: But because when we got into the anime fandom, that one school older than us was still there to show us the way, and that is how we absorbed both schools and also the future schools.

963
00:52:52,611 --> 00:52:55,607
Rym: I mean, I would go to the anime club library and I'd be like, "What should I

964
00:52:55,647 --> 00:52:55,928
Rym: watch?".

965
00:52:56,270 --> 00:53:00,263
Rym: and someone older than me would be like, "Watch this.

966
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:01,447
Rym: What's it about?

967
00:53:01,607 --> 00:53:01,908
Rym: Watch

968
00:53:01,989 --> 00:53:02,049
Rym: it.".

969
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:03,321
Rym: But watch it.

970
00:53:03,382 --> 00:53:03,969
Rym: And I'd watch it.

971
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:05,509
Rym: And they were usually right.

972
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:13,050
Rym: And there was this continuation of the culture, which in comic fandom in America is almost too strong.

973
00:53:13,994 --> 00:53:17,450
Rym: But in anime fandom, I think that continuity of culture is broken.

974
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:20,910
Rym: I think it's absolutely at the edge of being completely broken.

975
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:24,270
Rym: And to use a personal anecdote, I'll be honest.

976
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:35,908
Rym: If we were not sort of industry press people, if we were not doing GeekNights, being pressed, commenting, performing, I probably would have stopped going to anime cons like four years ago.

977
00:53:36,735 --> 00:53:37,470
Scott: Yeah, probably.

978
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:41,550
Rym: Because there's nothing for me at them that's related to anime.

979
00:53:41,691 --> 00:53:49,550
Rym: I mean, Daryl Surratt and Mike Tool and all these people do great stuff, but we know a lot of what they know, the things they show me.

980
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:50,990
Scott: Because they've told it to us already.

981
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:51,472
Rym: Yes.

982
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:56,850
Rym: Or they're things that I already know, or things that I'll find out as I'm researching that thing, and vice versa.

983
00:53:57,030 --> 00:54:00,170
Rym: I'm not going to say anything that Daryl Surratt doesn't already know about anime.

984
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:00,750
Scott: That's for sure.

985
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:05,870
Rym: So there's no one to show me any mysteries because I've plumbed a lot of the mysteries.

986
00:54:07,751 --> 00:54:13,330
Rym: And beyond that, the fan culture has nothing for me anymore.

987
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:17,050
Rym: And it's not just because of the age difference.

988
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:30,730
Rym: Because the age difference between us, you know, 30s, and the punk kids at anime cons now, 14, is not bigger than the difference between us when we were in our 20s, and the 40 and 50 year old guys who were at the cons telling us what to watch.

989
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:31,348
Scott: That's right.

990
00:54:32,731 --> 00:54:41,610
Scott: Even though a lot of what we were told was not by 40 and 50 year old guys at cons, but by, you know, we were 18 and 25 year old guys at anime club were telling us.

991
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:43,348
Rym: But I got a lot from cons too.

992
00:54:43,611 --> 00:54:44,067
Scott: We got some.

993
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:46,090
Rym: And I think there was a continuity of the con culture.

994
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:51,630
Scott: And also when we would go to the con dealer's room, right, it wasn't just all Naruto headbands, right?

995
00:54:52,332 --> 00:54:57,790
Scott: Basically all they had in those days was old school stuff, and you would learn just looking around what was going on.

996
00:54:57,950 --> 00:54:58,071
Rym: Yep.

997
00:54:58,132 --> 00:54:59,650
Rym: You'd see that blonde woman everywhere.

998
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:00,328
Rym: Like, who's that?

999
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:08,870
Rym: And then you'd learn about, like, Mattel and all that, you know, Arcadia skies of Matsumoto verse three, nine, nine galaxies.

1000
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:09,431
Scott: Yeah.

1001
00:55:09,451 --> 00:55:11,349
Scott: You see stuff and you try to figure out what it is.

1002
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:14,749
Scott: Now you have to dig in the dealer's room to find any old stuff.

1003
00:55:15,231 --> 00:55:29,790
Rym: But I think that this phenomenon is universal to all things that are in any way related to popular culture, even within, you know, within subcultures, they have their own popular cultures, like in those universes, in those fish bowls.

1004
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:35,490
Rym: I think this idea of things are super popular when they fade out, I mean, fads, it happens.

1005
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:49,710
Rym: I just think, I posit to you, this is barely a hypothesis, that anime fandom in America specifically has this problem in order of magnitude or more greater than any other equivalent fandom.

1006
00:55:51,032 --> 00:55:54,810
Rym: And I have some theories as to why, and that's all I got for you.

1007
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:55,467
Scott: Yep.

1008
00:55:56,271 --> 00:56:07,690
Rym: I mean, it amazes me, like, we'll do an anime you should see panel at an anime con, and I'd say 90% of the people have not seen anime that I would consider kind of, like, basic?

1009
00:56:08,992 --> 00:56:11,409
Rym: And I don't think I'm unjustified in saying that they're basic.

1010
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:19,350
Rym: You're like going to a film convention, being like, so I don't think I need to tell you all to watch Citizen Kane, and three quarters of the audience are like, Citizen who?

1011
00:56:20,112 --> 00:56:20,201
Rym: Yeah.

1012
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:20,561
Rym: What?

1013
00:56:23,132 --> 00:56:33,469
Scott: So yeah, we should, you know, you should go out, and if you are one of those younger fans who has not been mentored by the old, you probably can't possibly be in that category because you already listen to the show.

1014
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:41,410
Rym: Yeah, but I want to hear your comments and anecdotes, I want to figure out if there is something to this, if there is something different about anime fandom.

1015
00:56:41,871 --> 00:56:49,449
Rym: My strongest hypothesis is that it has to do with the churn of anime fans engaging in anime fan culture, so we can't see.

1016
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,930
Rym: It's like under the radar, off the radar anime fans.

1017
00:56:53,090 --> 00:57:05,059
Scott: I also want to put together a list of shows, right, that not even the A shows, right, that were forgotten, but also sort of the shows that were moderately popular, you know, 10, 12, 15 years ago, that have now disappeared.

1018
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:08,137
Scott: Shows that are sort of like.

1019
00:57:08,198 --> 00:57:09,750
Scott: on that, you know, you're under arrest level.

1020
00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:12,850
Rym: I was going to say YUA is probably the poster child of that.

1021
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:16,470
Scott: It was like about these two police girls, and back in the day it was kind of popular.

1022
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:18,730
Rym: Kind of popular, it was, like everyone knew that show.

1023
00:57:18,851 --> 00:57:21,150
Scott: Everyone at the anime club knew that show, at least.

1024
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:22,670
Rym: Yeah, everyone at an anime club knew that show.

1025
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:34,170
Scott: I haven't heard anyone else really mention it outside the anime club, but it's like, it was moderately popular, you know, I know some people were super fans of it, big time, and now you don't hear about that show at all.

1026
00:57:34,411 --> 00:57:35,490
Scott: It is gone.

1027
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:39,949
Rym: Marmalade Boy, Kimiguri, Orange Road, we already talked about Caricano.

1028
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:51,688
Scott: The quality of these shows you could debate over, right, are they good or bad, but the point is, they had some level of popularity, you know, in the past, and now they are effectively disappeared, at least in the U.S.

1029
00:57:51,729 --> 00:57:59,670
Scott: culture, and I imagine, I don't know for sure in Japan, but I'm pretty sure, you know, a good guess, no one in Japan is talking about, you know, Marmalade Boy.

1030
00:57:59,930 --> 00:58:02,429
Rym: Ah, but Scott, how many people remember, I mean, Wings?

1031
00:58:04,453 --> 00:58:05,109
Scott: What do you mean Wings?

1032
00:58:05,673 --> 00:58:06,949
Rym: It's a sitcom from America.

1033
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:08,270
Scott: Oh, I was thinking of anime.

1034
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:09,490
Scott: That was moderately popular.

1035
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:14,170
Scott: I only know it existed because it was on after a show, or before a show that I wanted to watch.

1036
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:22,925
Rym: That's just pop culture stuff, but you know, those shows are all forgotten, and the only ones that are going to be remembered in the long run are things like, you know, the classics, the Andy Griffith Show, The Simpsons.

1037
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:25,290
Scott: I'm surprised people remember 21 Jump Street.

1038
00:58:26,653 --> 00:58:28,989
Rym: I don't think most people know that it's based on a show.

1039
00:58:30,295 --> 00:58:31,269
Scott: Oh, you think it's like that.

1040
00:58:31,571 --> 00:58:39,570
Rym: I think the only people who know it's based on the show are people who are 30 or older, and 30 is probably, like, literally the youngest person.

1041
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,363
Scott: You think anyone's going to see Prometheus?

1042
00:58:41,383 --> 00:58:42,170
Scott: who hasn't seen Alien?

1043
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:45,870
Rym: I think almost, I think the majority of people.

1044
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:46,717
Scott: I think half.

1045
00:58:49,352 --> 00:58:50,970
Rym: I'm going to say half the people who go see Prometheus.

1046
00:58:51,531 --> 00:58:55,042
Scott: If I owned a movie theater, I'd go in before the movie, I'd be like, "Raise your hand if you have not seen

1047
00:58:55,123 --> 00:58:55,446
Scott: Alien.".

1048
00:58:56,570 --> 00:58:56,738
Rym: "Aliens.".

1049
00:58:57,673 --> 00:59:09,710
Rym: Ah, so thus, something I want to say about anime cons, because I think we could fix this, if you think it's a problem, pretty easily, by doing something very simple at anime cons.

1050
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:10,910
Rym: You don't have to change anything.

1051
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:16,150
Rym: Let the Homestuck kids run around and have their, like, gay pony panels, whatever it is they want, who cares?

1052
00:59:17,072 --> 00:59:21,965
Rym: All you have to do, this is the thing that we tried to push through at Otakon, which is one of the reasons they kicked us off.

1053
00:59:22,026 --> 00:59:33,169
Rym: the staff, as far as I can tell, have screening rooms, show anime, have those showings be curated, and have someone who knows what they're talking about introduce a show.

1054
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:34,870
Scott: But those kids are never going to come in that room.

1055
00:59:35,091 --> 00:59:40,328
Rym: I think they would, if you didn't schedule them as, you know, "Kare Kanno Episode

1056
00:59:40,328 --> 00:59:40,692
Rym: 1.".

1057
00:59:40,692 --> 00:59:41,588
Rym: No one's going to go to that.

1058
00:59:42,273 --> 00:59:48,569
Rym: If you schedule this as fucking robot shows, people will show up there just to see what's up.

1059
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:49,489
Scott: Someone might show up.

1060
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:50,307
Rym: I think people would.

1061
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:52,430
Rym: Shows your mom wouldn't let you watch.

1062
00:59:52,931 --> 00:59:54,830
Rym: Old stuff you probably should have watched.

1063
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:57,169
Rym: Stuff you probably didn't think you'd like.

1064
00:59:58,155 --> 00:59:59,349
Rym: And you show them Princess Tutu.

1065
01:00:00,394 --> 01:00:03,809
Rym: And you have someone actually explain, like, "So here's the deal with this show.

1066
01:00:04,192 --> 01:00:05,230
Rym: Here's why this show...".

1067
01:00:05,291 --> 01:00:06,570
Scott: Yep, it's the old idea.

1068
01:00:06,991 --> 01:00:09,430
Rym: The old idea we've been pitching for six years.

1069
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:11,789
Scott: Maybe use one of our too many ConnectiCon rooms and do it.

1070
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:13,910
Rym: Because that's the screenings department.

1071
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:14,879
Rym: I don't want to get involved.

1072
01:00:16,611 --> 01:00:17,628
Rym: I've got enough to deal with.

1073
01:00:18,431 --> 01:00:22,070
Rym: Also, I don't have time to personally curate that.

1074
01:00:22,291 --> 01:00:24,089
Scott: I could do one room for three days.

1075
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:28,710
Rym: Yeah, you have other duties, captain, like head of operations for panels and workshops.

1076
01:00:29,291 --> 01:00:30,228
Scott: I'll just quit that job.

1077
01:00:31,374 --> 01:00:34,189
Rym: If you quit that job, I swear to God, I'll punch you in the eyeball.

1078
01:00:34,712 --> 01:00:35,286
Scott: Anyway, let's...

1079
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:35,909
Rym: The left one.

1080
01:00:38,078 --> 01:00:39,109
Scott: Let's go and finish the show.

1081
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:40,490
Rym: I think we're pretty much done.

1082
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:43,899
Rym: We've had our rambly, old timer, "Back in my

1083
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:44,224
Rym: day!".

1084
01:00:44,872 --> 01:00:51,850
Rym: Thing is, back in our day, you know, the old anime cons, there was still punk kids running around yelling and screaming.

1085
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:53,510
Rym: A lot of that stuff hasn't changed that much.

1086
01:00:54,010 --> 01:01:01,330
Rym: I think the only thing that's changed is that back then, the older people were still there in force next to the younger people.

1087
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:02,749
Scott: There were also less people total.

1088
01:01:03,011 --> 01:01:22,370
Rym: Yeah, but even as Otakon started getting gigantic, when they took over the whole BCC and all that, there was a wider range of ages represented more equally, and I feel like it's skewing younger and younger, and meanwhile, the other bubble of the older anime fans are just leaving.

1089
01:01:23,691 --> 01:01:25,545
Rym: And we could do a whole show on why.

1090
01:01:25,586 --> 01:01:26,070
Rym: I think that is.

1091
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:27,489
Rym: We might have already done a show on that.

1092
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:38,709
Rym: But I think that, in my opinion, that disconnect in the anime culture and anime fandom is the primary reason why we're seeing so many very popular shows forgotten so quickly.

1093
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:40,327
Scott: The memory is not being passed down.

1094
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:43,429
Rym: Yes, relative to other fan cultures of similar things.

1095
01:01:49,583 --> 01:01:51,720
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1096
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:56,860
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1097
01:01:57,220 --> 01:02:02,239
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1098
01:02:02,522 --> 01:02:05,200
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1099
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:09,899
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1101
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,740
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1102
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:20,860
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
