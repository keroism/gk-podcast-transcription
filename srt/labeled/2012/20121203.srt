00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,323
Rym: It's Monday, December 3rd, 2012.

2
00:00:10,323 --> 00:00:10,503
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:10,523 --> 00:00:28,330
Rym: I'm yawning And this is GeekNights tonight, we're talking about network sniffing and what programmers don't understand about networks and sniffing.

4
00:00:30,373 --> 00:00:31,407
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:32,795 --> 00:00:35,674
Scott: So go to lunch today Doing your thing.

6
00:00:35,815 --> 00:00:37,881
Scott: as happens in the city you walk down the street.

7
00:00:38,102 --> 00:00:41,875
Rym: I went to Hale and Hardy had a really kind of mediocre Soup.

8
00:00:42,198 --> 00:00:49,476
Rym: I had some overpriced Sushi that weren't too bad got a really really shit cookie because they have the shittest cookies And I really wanted a cookie.

9
00:00:49,556 --> 00:00:51,646
Scott: as you get the cookie there cuz I really wanted to come.

10
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:52,590
Scott: which is the cookie there?

11
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:53,104
Rym: I don't know.

12
00:00:53,932 --> 00:00:54,916
Scott: Sorry, like two dollars.

13
00:00:55,116 --> 00:00:58,930
Rym: the problem is that I get back to the office and one of my co-workers is like a bra brownies.

14
00:01:01,414 --> 00:01:09,670
Scott: So I'm walking to lunch and Fire engines going down the street, and I'm like okay the usual usual, and there's a you know the the fire SUV is behind it.

15
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,517
Scott: I'm like okay.

16
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:11,403
Scott: I go to lunch.

17
00:01:11,444 --> 00:01:12,210
Scott: I come back from lunch.

18
00:01:12,934 --> 00:01:19,049
Scott: I come back from lunch, and I see that on the intersection outside my office There is a great deal of fire and police.

19
00:01:19,352 --> 00:01:23,378
Rym: Interesting because a few days ago And I tweeted about this the exact same thing happened to me.

20
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:29,449
Rym: there were fire engines blocking like City Hall and like they'd Evacuated the park and all the entrances were locked up.

21
00:01:29,993 --> 00:01:34,424
Scott: Okay, so anyway something was going on in the street And I couldn't really see and I didn't give a shit that much.

22
00:01:34,444 --> 00:01:35,290
Scott: so I went to the office.

23
00:01:35,633 --> 00:01:41,130
Scott: I get to the office I look out the window I can kind of see but I can't really tell what's going on and I'm like okay something's going on there.

24
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:46,204
Scott: So I go back to work sitting down eating the lunch doing the work a couple hours later.

25
00:01:46,364 --> 00:01:47,247
Scott: Get up stretch.

26
00:01:47,588 --> 00:01:48,250
Scott: We got the window.

27
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:55,599
Scott: There's police all around there still and I'm like What could possibly have happened there?

28
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,887
Scott: that they're hanging out for hours.

29
00:01:57,907 --> 00:01:58,650
Scott: you you know?

30
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:01,464
Scott: It's like I figured you know somebody got hurt.

31
00:02:01,505 --> 00:02:09,769
Scott: Maybe somebody fell maybe some you know who know you know someone car accident something like that and They just you know clean it up in an hour and go away.

32
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:14,690
Rym: What's interesting is the same thing happened to me before and I basically did the same thing you did right?

33
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,498
Scott: So they're sitting there, and it's been hours.

34
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,071
Scott: You know it was like noon, and this is like at 3 30.

35
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:21,110
Scott: They're still out there, and it's mostly police.

36
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:33,450
Scott: They've got it roped off and I can see the subway station on that side is closed and nobody's going into the subway on this On my side of the street Which is not good because I need to go in there to get home without walking anywhere.

37
00:02:33,591 --> 00:02:39,958
Scott: So I go to Google and usually when I google for like ultra local, New York news It's not that easy to find it.

38
00:02:39,998 --> 00:02:43,113
Scott: like remember that time we were biking back from New Jersey And there's a fire.

39
00:02:43,655 --> 00:02:45,041
Scott: I tried to google that fire the next day.

40
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,045
Scott: I couldn't find shit.

41
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:55,550
Rym: nah, man well the thing is what the point I was going to make is that I have a much a Pretty good success rate when weird shit happens in New York of finding out what it was.

42
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,690
Scott: But if it has to be big enough over a certain threshold that a news truck will show ah it just has to be in.

43
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,717
Rym: As far as I found this was in Manhattan.

44
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,030
Scott: the fire yeah, right, but it's like that fire that fire.

45
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,859
Rym: Yeah, I'm gonna wonder if I can find that fire now.

46
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:16,790
Scott: Good luck anyway, but anyway Yeah, it's like if the news breaks a certain threshold then it'll be really easy to find because it's fucking New York City.

47
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:24,318
Scott: But if it's like below, it's actually rather hard to find if no one reports on it, right I still think my idea for a website.

48
00:03:24,358 --> 00:03:25,000
Rym: I just want to call it.

49
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:25,844
Rym: What the fuck was that?

50
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:30,285
Rym: calm yeah And all it is is you just log you know locations.

51
00:03:30,386 --> 00:03:33,259
Scott: usually what I do is I try to search Twitter and Google News.

52
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:36,212
Scott: those are my go and then I go to the New York news Websites.

53
00:03:36,252 --> 00:03:40,710
Scott: the real way to find stuff out like this is have a police radio, but I don't have one of those there.

54
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:44,717
Rym: I don't know how it is here, but in some places I've been there are weird laws like you can hold.

55
00:03:44,777 --> 00:03:49,170
Rym: you can own a police scanner, but not have it in your car.

56
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:56,300
Scott: Interesting yeah, I wonder if it's legal to take a police scanner Take the audio output and stream it on the internet.

57
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,052
Scott: so some we just go to the website and listen to like New York police Scanner.

58
00:03:59,214 --> 00:04:01,030
Rym: I'll bet it depends on state and city laws.

59
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:09,381
Rym: But I will say this when I was a kid We had a police scanner right and in the old days the way this worked is you get crystals for whatever Channels like in a CB radio you'd buy like right

60
00:04:09,421 --> 00:04:15,329
Scott: because if you just buy a scanner They remove those channels as possibilities, and those are only good for like listening

61
00:04:16,891 --> 00:04:18,576
Rym: Than that I'm talking like when I was a kid in the

62
00:04:18,897 --> 00:04:18,957
Scott: 80s.

63
00:04:19,036 --> 00:04:22,407
Rym: No you really couldn't get a variable antenna.

64
00:04:22,487 --> 00:04:28,410
Rym: or like a variable radio you plug in a little crystal that would resonate and give you like the.

65
00:04:29,152 --> 00:04:34,790
Rym: So you'd buy like a channel 13 crystal for your CB radio and your radio had like three slots.

66
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,990
Rym: So you could have up to three crystals.

67
00:04:36,528 --> 00:04:40,048
Rym: I Remember one day for my birthday my dad got me a second crystals.

68
00:04:40,088 --> 00:04:42,800
Rym: my brother And I could use two different channels on our CB radios.

69
00:04:43,443 --> 00:04:44,327
Rym: that was the fucking.

70
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:44,990
Rym: that was awesome.

71
00:04:45,632 --> 00:04:50,130
Rym: But so there were channels for our police scanner like we had crystals for all this stuff.

72
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,449
Rym: But there were some crystals that you weren't allowed to buy.

73
00:04:53,353 --> 00:04:55,602
Rym: My dad was a fireman so we had all the crystals.

74
00:04:55,944 --> 00:04:57,530
Scott: so we'd listen to all the crystals.

75
00:04:57,691 --> 00:04:59,366
Rym: We left it on scanning all the time.

76
00:04:59,426 --> 00:05:04,910
Rym: so at night There'd be like we just find out about crazy fires and go watch houses burn down anyway.

77
00:05:05,131 --> 00:05:12,299
Scott: So I go to Google News, and I say 49th Street, and I immediately find So it was some fight on the subway platform.

78
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:15,447
Scott: dude pushed a dude on the tracks got hit and died.

79
00:05:15,688 --> 00:05:18,143
Scott: not cool Not cool at all.

80
00:05:18,344 --> 00:05:19,049
Scott: kind of weird.

81
00:05:19,973 --> 00:05:26,930
Rym: It's like if I was gonna fight a dude Which I wouldn't do I point out already the kinds of people who get into a fight on the subway.

82
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:28,537
Rym: We're taking time bombs.

83
00:05:28,678 --> 00:05:30,650
Scott: apparently it was like a 60 year old guy who got killed.

84
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:39,554
Rym: So the question is was he killed by another old man in an old idea, or was he killed by the stereotypical In quotes gang?

85
00:05:39,855 --> 00:05:45,904
Scott: I didn't read the Google News that much more than men so you can go read it if you want more details Which I'm sure the police collected over those many hours.

86
00:05:45,944 --> 00:05:46,910
Scott: They were all hanging out there.

87
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:50,294
Scott: There were a lot of top brass on that street corner And mine was.

88
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:53,090
Rym: so the thing I saw was much less interesting in the end.

89
00:05:53,171 --> 00:05:54,469
Rym: You know I wonder what was going on.

90
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,422
Rym: I tried to like pull I was like I'm impressed.

91
00:05:57,442 --> 00:05:58,185
Rym: could I get a statement?

92
00:05:58,205 --> 00:06:03,169
Rym: and the cop was like Even if I knew not telling anyone.

93
00:06:04,153 --> 00:06:23,650
Rym: So I gave up, and I went about my business and later on Twitter I learned that it was a AIDS activist had climbed a flagpole and hung a flag and Apparently that entails shutting down the entire park having every cop in the world there cordoning off everything And there's like 20 cops standing around watching one dude very slowly in a cherry picker like cut the flag down.

94
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,944
Scott: They couldn't send 19 of those cops to a bad neighborhood instead.

95
00:06:26,964 --> 00:06:31,020
Rym: no and they had this like Terrorism rapid response unit there too.

96
00:06:31,081 --> 00:06:33,189
Rym: that I learned about by googling because I saw there's.

97
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:41,569
Rym: no He didn't put a bomb on with the flag up on that because the dude who hung the flag was still there yelling About how he put the flag up.

98
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:45,723
Rym: I'm just I'm so unafraid of terrorists that it annoys.

99
00:06:45,903 --> 00:06:47,670
Rym: it annoys and amazes me the reactions.

100
00:06:47,831 --> 00:06:50,059
Rym: But then again, New York is much calmer than Boston.

101
00:06:50,762 --> 00:06:58,510
Rym: I guess remember when they overreacted to that Little like LED light show that was all around the city anyway and all the threads on the internet.

102
00:06:58,771 --> 00:07:02,862
Scott: You know I sort of joked like you know I should run to be.

103
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:05,449
Scott: you know mayor on the platform that I'll you know.

104
00:07:05,951 --> 00:07:07,236
Scott: Make the police not suck.

105
00:07:07,396 --> 00:07:12,333
Scott: because also you know in somewhat related, New York cop news There have been.

106
00:07:12,353 --> 00:07:14,040
Scott: there have been like two or three good cops.

107
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:16,430
Scott: one of them has a website that doesn't look very well.

108
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,439
Rym: Here's a million websites of police scanners.

109
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:20,609
Rym: We can just listen to live from anywhere in the country nice.

110
00:07:21,491 --> 00:07:23,017
Scott: But anyway the there was.

111
00:07:23,278 --> 00:07:27,756
Scott: there have been a few cops in New York City who were like just exposing The hell out of the police.

112
00:07:27,796 --> 00:07:31,010
Scott: he's like look I brought in an audio video recorder to the police meeting.

113
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:35,910
Scott: Here's the precinct chief guy saying talking about the quota that doesn't exist.

114
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:41,010
Scott: But he's saying you he says like straight up you guys go you gotta go arrest more dudes.

115
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,322
Rym: Well, I thought about this a lot like if I were.

116
00:07:43,342 --> 00:07:57,604
Rym: you know New York City is complicated But like when we lived in Beacon upstate if I ran the police like enforcement division in that city I would basically fuzz not bother with Speeders anymore and kind of the basic stuff and I would just go after.

117
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:05,152
Rym: I would just have one dude whose sole job Was to pull people over don't turn their headlights on at night or in the rain, and I'd make the fine like $5,000.

118
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:08,642
Scott: yeah, I'd go after all this stuff that people don't you know.

119
00:08:08,702 --> 00:08:14,830
Scott: think to go after that's actually worth going after and if you're In a small town you can go to bike thieves you go after all kinds of good stuff.

120
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:18,985
Rym: Also, I'd really go after littering because it'd be really it's low-hanging fruit there.

121
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:26,270
Scott: Yep, but yeah No, they go after watching a guy put a flag in a flagpole and all you know and then they do stuff like have quotas?

122
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:27,321
Scott: They're not supposed to have.

123
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:31,525
Scott: but yeah If I could write if I could get elected mayor somehow I could.

124
00:08:31,585 --> 00:08:34,886
Scott: I would take that guy that Whistle-blowing cop who you know who?

125
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:45,670
Scott: You know who was like hey, there's a quota and published it and everything and I would say you're the commissioner now Boom you know in New York City and all the cops would freak the fuck out and maybe try to kill me.

126
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,466
Scott: But doesn't matter I'd implement.

127
00:08:48,151 --> 00:08:52,966
Rym: I'd like the idea of every cop having to wear a GoPro or equivalent whenever they're on duty of course.

128
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:55,756
Scott: so you know some special Police can make all the shit public.

129
00:08:56,098 --> 00:08:57,162
Scott: you know police meetings.

130
00:08:57,222 --> 00:08:58,085
Scott: Yeah, it's fucking public.

131
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,290
Scott: might as well be town council meeting.

132
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:00,132
Rym: I would.

133
00:09:00,794 --> 00:09:05,990
Rym: you do need to have the ability to meet privately like say you say the detectives are figuring out the serial killer case.

134
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,356
Rym: Okay, they don't.

135
00:09:07,396 --> 00:09:09,470
Rym: you don't want the guy who committed the crimes now watching.

136
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,650
Scott: Well, I'm talking about the meeting where the police get together in the morning, and they're like all right guys.

137
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:14,254
Scott: This is what we're doing.

138
00:09:14,294 --> 00:09:15,260
Rym: Yeah, but what if in that meeting.

139
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,924
Rym: They're like all right.

140
00:09:15,964 --> 00:09:16,870
Rym: remember that serial killer?

141
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,473
Scott: They don't do that.

142
00:09:17,653 --> 00:09:18,517
Scott: those meetings are pretty.

143
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:19,682
Scott: have you ever been to one of those meetings.

144
00:09:20,023 --> 00:09:22,574
Rym: I actually have in Detroit So boring.

145
00:09:22,614 --> 00:09:24,001
Scott: it's like all right guys listen up.

146
00:09:24,423 --> 00:09:26,050
Scott: We got the quota that we're not supposed to have.

147
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,669
Scott: We're gonna use a different word to describe it.

148
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:31,890
Scott: But you guys are behind or ahead good job or bad job and look at this wall.

149
00:09:32,212 --> 00:09:33,601
Scott: You know those are the people who are wanted.

150
00:09:33,661 --> 00:09:34,104
Scott: you'll notice.

151
00:09:34,124 --> 00:09:35,090
Scott: There's a new got in Detroit.

152
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:38,224
Rym: They had the wall of unsolved murders that have not been given up.

153
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,470
Scott: look at that new face on the wall.

154
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,875
Scott: Just remember it before you go out.

155
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:43,124
Scott: that guy hasn't paid child support in like six months.

156
00:09:43,164 --> 00:09:49,930
Scott: if you see him bag him in and You know we're setting up a little checkpoint over on this street today because it's gonna be a drunken party.

157
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,463
Rym: Why can't it be more like a robo cop or Gotham Central?

158
00:09:52,704 --> 00:09:53,870
Scott: It is not like that at all.

159
00:09:54,835 --> 00:09:59,297
Scott: I see no reason why that meeting Could not be public.

160
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:02,130
Rym: so this is some old news.

161
00:10:02,512 --> 00:10:04,769
Rym: That's old for from a number of angles.

162
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,799
Rym: But I realized it hasn't been talked about a lot in the technologies front.

163
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:08,000
Rym: now.

164
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,170
Rym: sadly slash shot linked to an article about it.

165
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,360
Rym: So I thought oh, this is a good opportunity to talk about it.

166
00:10:13,983 --> 00:10:24,298
Rym: the article is so Poorly written and it beats around the bush so much it actually doesn't really explain what the problem is Until like 40 paragraphs in.

167
00:10:24,318 --> 00:10:27,449
Scott: that must be a real clean bush nice and circular shaped.

168
00:10:28,752 --> 00:10:30,600
Rym: You could beat around in a regular bush.

169
00:10:30,821 --> 00:10:32,910
Rym: Just as easily as a nice and clean bush.

170
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,488
Scott: Well, that's beating off in the bush not beating around the bush.

171
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:38,967
Scott: You've never been to the bush.

172
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:49,350
Rym: So here's the deal on the highest highest level because I swear you don't care about the details under this.

173
00:10:49,953 --> 00:10:53,110
Rym: Though part of the problem is that you don't care about the deals under details under this.

174
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,608
Rym: But part of the solution is that those details are so old they don't matter.

175
00:10:57,751 --> 00:11:04,833
Rym: So people who live in rural areas are having calls to their landlines drops with a surprising Frequency.

176
00:11:04,853 --> 00:11:06,981
Scott: we're talking as in so you live in the sticks.

177
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:08,125
Scott: someone tries to call you.

178
00:11:08,206 --> 00:11:09,149
Scott: the phone doesn't ring.

179
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:15,610
Rym: now We're talking like early AT&T iPhone levels like greater than 20% of inbound calls.

180
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,230
Rym: Just never make it or get dropped within the first few seconds.

181
00:11:19,035 --> 00:11:29,310
Scott: Now you might think oh duh ancient rural Infrastructure not really shitty phone lines and phone switches that are like a hundred years old and they don't work anymore.

182
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,536
Rym: You're probably picturing those one-way power lines.

183
00:11:31,576 --> 00:11:36,870
Rym: They use in really podunk towns where it grounds out to the earth around the end by your house.

184
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,017
Scott: Yeah, and guess what?

185
00:11:38,158 --> 00:11:39,103
Rym: That's not the problem.

186
00:11:39,124 --> 00:11:40,110
Scott: Yeah, that shit fucking works.

187
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:46,890
Rym: Actually, those lines are actually higher quality than the lines in most cities and they're much better maintained.

188
00:11:47,211 --> 00:11:49,942
Rym: Yeah, the problem is they don't have digital congestion.

189
00:11:49,962 --> 00:11:51,990
Scott: They have a frickin separate wire for everybody.

190
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,810
Rym: So let's go back to the early days.

191
00:11:53,931 --> 00:11:58,169
Rym: You know Ma Bell the old days of phone systems in the United States like the 80s.

192
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:08,345
Rym: So in that time there was this sort of analog system with some digital Components of routing calls around and it was actually really really really complex.

193
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:20,659
Rym: the technology around it was amazing Especially for the day especially considering how much of it was analog and mechanical And you had to be able to route a call from anywhere in the country to anywhere else in the country And it might have taken a while to connect.

194
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:24,859
Scott: like you call you wait you wait you wait and it rings But eventually it fucking worked all the time.

195
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,528
Rym: Do you remember Scott from the 80s?

196
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:34,789
Rym: How a lot like when they taught you remember all those classes and like elementary school Like here's how to do a letterhead when they teach you like how long to let the phone ring.

197
00:12:35,911 --> 00:12:37,458
Scott: No one taught me how long to let the phone ring.

198
00:12:37,499 --> 00:12:39,749
Scott: I just let the phone ring until I heard ringing.

199
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:45,410
Rym: Really really we were told six rings for a local call eight rings for a long distance.

200
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:50,745
Rym: No one ever taught me ten rings for an international call because no one had answering machines or voicemail.

201
00:12:50,785 --> 00:12:51,267
Scott: That's true.

202
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:54,850
Rym: I Remember we got our first answering machine is a big fucking deal.

203
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:59,490
Scott: But I just you know you wait on the phone long enough some number of rings until you get tired of fucking waiting.

204
00:12:59,811 --> 00:13:03,770
Rym: Yeah thing is you don't know a too long cuz that was in play cuz what if the person was screening their calls?

205
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,895
Scott: Yeah, anyway, don't do that.

206
00:13:06,016 --> 00:13:14,163
Rym: So all that infrastructure had of course a ridiculous body of legislation around it and one of the things had to do with how to pay.

207
00:13:14,404 --> 00:13:18,696
Rym: because there's the local loop then there's Like the more like the regional telco.

208
00:13:18,997 --> 00:13:23,910
Rym: then there's the switching between like different like higher level regions and long-distance calls.

209
00:13:24,294 --> 00:13:25,810
Rym: It used to be that it wasn't a long.

210
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:29,910
Rym: It was a long-distance call to call someone who lived like the next town over.

211
00:13:30,151 --> 00:13:33,020
Scott: Yeah, basically, it's like, you know, we could dial.

212
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,110
Scott: you have a seven-digit phone number and to this day this still works, right?

213
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:42,230
Scott: You could just dial somebody's seven-digit phone numbers straight up as long as they're in the same area code, right?

214
00:13:42,491 --> 00:13:46,039
Scott: But if they're in a different area code You had to dial the area code.

215
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,030
Scott: now the area code is missing part of the phone number.

216
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,350
Rym: But even then it wasn't always.

217
00:13:49,532 --> 00:13:52,577
Rym: Sometimes you needed to dial the area code Even if they were in your area code.

218
00:13:52,638 --> 00:14:02,230
Rym: if you were in a region where there'd been a recent split Like, you know Detroit was the three one three area code and then it filled up One which is the country code for us and then the number.

219
00:14:03,212 --> 00:14:12,259
Rym: Funny thing is back then I one meant I am I'm making a call that I have to ask my parents to do first because right because it cost money Lots of money.

220
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:18,970
Scott: local calls are basically we're free You don't have to pay anything extra above your you know standard pay money to keep the phone on flat rate.

221
00:14:19,131 --> 00:14:22,466
Rym: Actually, we paid a flat rate for our first phone line.

222
00:14:22,747 --> 00:14:27,390
Rym: We paid for 450 local minutes on our secondary phone line.

223
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:33,528
Scott: I had a second phone line that we got way later only for a few years in the late 90s for internetting.

224
00:14:33,548 --> 00:14:39,730
Rym: Yep Because after we had cable we kept that second phone line because that was basically like my own personal phone line.

225
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:40,393
Rym: It was awesome.

226
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:44,390
Scott: I had my own personal phone line also, but I you know, we use the phone on it.

227
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,810
Rym: We used it because there was no, you know voice chat in games back then.

228
00:14:49,171 --> 00:14:53,770
Rym: So we would all like use that phone number into conference calls and then three-way calling with phones.

229
00:14:54,172 --> 00:14:56,909
Scott: Do that if I had a regular modem on that line as well?

230
00:14:57,193 --> 00:14:58,130
Rym: See we had a cable modem.

231
00:14:58,411 --> 00:15:06,714
Rym: but then we play like a quick deathmatch and like I'd call person a They would use their like conference calling from their parents to call person B. We've usually this chain.

232
00:15:06,734 --> 00:15:11,070
Rym: a bunch of people in there as voice chat while we played quick deathmatch should not do that.

233
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:18,290
Rym: Anyway, anyway, so for example rural local loops cost way more to build and maintain than the ones in cities.

234
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:24,170
Rym: So those local loops is regulations saying they got to charge more for terminated calls in those regions?

235
00:15:24,952 --> 00:15:30,850
Rym: We live in a world where none of that matters or even is accessible or visible to the vast majority of people.

236
00:15:31,652 --> 00:15:34,923
Rym: So as a result, the regulations haven't really changed much.

237
00:15:35,405 --> 00:15:36,890
Scott: and right it was basically an incentive.

238
00:15:36,951 --> 00:15:45,689
Scott: It was saying hey look phone company We want these people who live in the sticks to be able to have phone service because if you charge You know them the same amount you charge something lives in New York City.

239
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:50,430
Scott: It's not economically viable for you, which means you're not gonna build phone lines for the people in the sticks.

240
00:15:50,734 --> 00:15:52,010
Scott: So even the six won't have phones.

241
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:57,329
Scott: So we're gonna allow you to charge more money to people living in you know for phone calls to the sticks.

242
00:15:57,892 --> 00:16:04,755
Scott: So that you will want to build phone lines in the sticks and people in everyone in the whole country will have phones Including the sticks.

243
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:13,745
Scott: and thus that is why everyone in the country pretty much no matter where you live even the extreme sticks Extreme sticks you can get a phone line pretty easily.

244
00:16:14,146 --> 00:16:17,863
Rym: So here's the problem Nowadays, I mean there's a million websites.

245
00:16:17,883 --> 00:16:18,990
Rym: You can just buy phone numbers.

246
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:22,079
Rym: I have on my phone that basically that xkc said it best.

247
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:30,854
Rym: those first three digits in your phone number are are basically Random and your area code is basically just where you lived around 2004.

248
00:16:30,854 --> 00:16:31,547
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

249
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:40,367
Rym: So now the numbers don't really make sense like that anymore and you just dial one for everything if you dial one at all And all this just push you go to contacts you touch the person's name.

250
00:16:40,387 --> 00:16:50,947
Rym: it basically Call routing will be routed via a least cost model Meaning you'll route to these like, you know a call will be routed to some discount carrier because it's cheaper.

251
00:16:51,349 --> 00:16:58,382
Rym: that discount carrier then tries to route it as cheaply as possible to make a profit between what they get paid and what they have to pay to terminate the call.

252
00:16:58,402 --> 00:17:07,589
Rym: and What they're doing is if they have to terminate the call somewhere where there is a statutory rate That's high and they would lose money on the call.

253
00:17:08,175 --> 00:17:11,035
Rym: They just fucking drop it Even though that's totally illegal.

254
00:17:11,076 --> 00:17:16,876
Rym: the FCC apparently is fined no one for this because it's so hard to prove They don't have any resources.

255
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:20,310
Rym: It's basically an unenforceable set of legislation and there's a loophole.

256
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,157
Rym: Rather than terminating the call, you know what I can do.

257
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,290
Rym: Just keep looping it forever and never actually let it terminate.

258
00:17:26,471 --> 00:17:27,156
Rym: I didn't drop it.

259
00:17:27,257 --> 00:17:28,628
Rym: I just wait for the other person to give up.

260
00:17:30,052 --> 00:17:33,950
Scott: The other thing that's going on is you can read about this to get all the details.

261
00:17:34,071 --> 00:17:44,314
Scott: But a lot of places like you know One nine hundred number places and call centers set up their phone centers in specific places in the country Overloading those places.

262
00:17:44,334 --> 00:17:57,470
Scott: Yeah that have certain rates and then what happens is for there's a big fight about this because Google Voice basically blocks Entire section, you know entire sections of the country that have these like phone call places in them.

263
00:17:57,831 --> 00:18:01,589
Scott: You know these one nine hundred numbers because they don't want it to pay to service that bullshit.

264
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:02,833
Scott: now Bullshit.

265
00:18:03,195 --> 00:18:05,249
Scott: and there's a few people who live there get screwed by that.

266
00:18:05,611 --> 00:18:09,890
Scott: But the real phone companies like AT&T say hey, what the fuck?

267
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:14,210
Scott: How come Google is allowed to not service that unprofitable bullshit area?

268
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:24,590
Scott: But we're not allowed to not service that because there's the regulation that makes us do it and Google isn't following that regulation with Google Voice and it's well Google Voice is not the same thing as the actual phone company.

269
00:18:24,972 --> 00:18:36,374
Rym: Now couple this with the fact that for someone like me, I don't care Don't want those people to be on my phone network because they because the few people are caught up in the sort of like the Collateral damage.

270
00:18:36,856 --> 00:18:37,942
Rym: I don't know any of those people.

271
00:18:38,002 --> 00:18:38,866
Rym: I will never call them.

272
00:18:38,886 --> 00:18:39,610
Rym: They'll never call me.

273
00:18:39,771 --> 00:18:43,030
Scott: Yeah, and it's like if you're in the sticks, they already don't have cell phone service.

274
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:51,930
Scott: So they even though they you know, we still have this guarantee of wired service because this old regulation and old system, you know It's like well, there's no cell phone service.

275
00:18:51,971 --> 00:18:59,589
Rym: So really there is effective Example of something I used to do in the early days of email like if I'd run an email server I could set up filters.

276
00:19:00,052 --> 00:19:06,819
Rym: I'll basically block emails from any IP address in China Because that's where all the spam was coming from for a time.

277
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:13,749
Scott: then who in China is actually gonna email me or who has Hosted, you know hosted server in China that is sending legitimate emails to me?

278
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:18,510
Rym: Yep, nowadays that all comes from like hack people behind cable modems and whatever.

279
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:28,737
Rym: But anyway, so this is an interesting problem That is obsolete to young people who leave rural areas because I haven't had a landline Since the year 2000.

280
00:19:28,737 --> 00:19:30,864
Rym: I will probably never have a landline again.

281
00:19:30,884 --> 00:19:38,589
Rym: And sure there is a drawback I can't have my guaranteed phone service if the cell networks and power all go out like wire landlines do.

282
00:19:38,609 --> 00:19:40,433
Rym: I Just don't care.

283
00:19:40,735 --> 00:19:41,861
Rym: Don't care don't care at all.

284
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,957
Rym: We're good Got any news?

285
00:19:45,522 --> 00:19:50,269
Scott: Oh new you want news News news news news news news news.

286
00:19:51,511 --> 00:19:53,560
Scott: Okay, so I don't know if anyone realized this.

287
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:59,441
Scott: I'm sure everyone realized this but iTunes 11 just came out which is actually much delayed.

288
00:19:59,481 --> 00:20:05,796
Scott: It was supposed to come out around the iPhone 5 time you know, they announced it along with the New iPad and everything.

289
00:20:05,857 --> 00:20:09,030
Scott: recently, you know, I've had many and then I you know and everything like that.

290
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,885
Scott: It didn't appear but now it has appeared.

291
00:20:11,906 --> 00:20:15,319
Scott: so First of all, it's actually a major change.

292
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,087
Scott: It's it's not iTunes 10 point something.

293
00:20:17,128 --> 00:20:17,751
Scott: It's 11.

294
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:18,596
Scott: It's a whole new version.

295
00:20:18,616 --> 00:20:20,710
Scott: The UI is significantly changed.

296
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,674
Scott: You can see what they did.

297
00:20:21,694 --> 00:20:25,810
Scott: is they did sort of a clever thing where they updated it graphically, right?

298
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:28,989
Scott: But they also sort of gave it this new UI.

299
00:20:29,231 --> 00:20:29,833
Scott: but they put it.

300
00:20:29,913 --> 00:20:35,133
Scott: if you go to the menus you can change enough options to basically make it the same size and shape as The old one.

301
00:20:35,153 --> 00:20:37,123
Scott: like there's no sidebar with all those choices in it.

302
00:20:37,164 --> 00:20:39,960
Scott: But if you go to view sidebar Oh, look the sidebars back.

303
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:41,349
Scott: It looks like it used to right.

304
00:20:41,691 --> 00:20:53,530
Scott: But if you don't do that has this top bar and actually I kind of like the top bar But it requires more clicks to do certain things You know, so it's sort of this weird balance like like it better less efficient.

305
00:20:54,772 --> 00:20:59,850
Scott: But the major thing about iTunes 11 is a lot of people they be hitting on iTunes But wait, wait, wait, wait.

306
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:09,082
Rym: You're saying that people are flipping out because a UI of a general use Software product used by both technologists and non technologists changed.

307
00:21:09,443 --> 00:21:11,370
Scott: Well, no, I'm saying that that's expected right?

308
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:16,910
Scott: What I'm saying is there are people who already hated iTunes period regardless of oh my god, it changed, right?

309
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,556
Scott: They just hate iTunes period I'll admit.

310
00:21:18,576 --> 00:21:21,026
Rym: I haven't used iTunes in like six years.

311
00:21:21,066 --> 00:21:22,050
Rym: I have no use for it.

312
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,332
Rym: I'm done.

313
00:21:22,372 --> 00:21:23,438
Scott: I have an iDevice.

314
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:30,760
Scott: I don't have an iDevice needed and even if I did You mean even if you did you have you.

315
00:21:30,881 --> 00:21:32,650
Scott: if you have an iDevice you got to use iTunes.

316
00:21:33,854 --> 00:21:34,850
Scott: Unless you jailbreak us.

317
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:38,343
Rym: I pretty much only listen to music on Spotify and my own mp3 is.

318
00:21:38,424 --> 00:21:41,316
Rym: I just drag out of my file system right now I got you know, I'm you got it.

319
00:21:41,336 --> 00:21:43,164
Scott: You know, you want to buy some apps in the App Store.

320
00:21:43,184 --> 00:21:44,370
Scott: That's iTunes.

321
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:47,483
Scott: Yeah, you want to sync that's iTunes podcast.

322
00:21:47,543 --> 00:21:49,250
Rym: A lot of people have trouble with podcasts now.

323
00:21:49,492 --> 00:21:50,238
Scott: I don't my.

324
00:21:50,278 --> 00:21:51,710
Scott: it's always worked for me just fine.

325
00:21:52,131 --> 00:21:53,094
Rym: But apparently what the?

326
00:21:53,535 --> 00:21:57,807
Rym: the thing that changed is you can't do certain kinds of organizational task manual anymore.

327
00:21:58,268 --> 00:22:05,509
Rym: and the podcast Stuff in iTunes 11 is tech is like aimed pegged by some values in the id3 tags.

328
00:22:06,712 --> 00:22:17,730
Rym: So people who don't use like the RSS feeds and like manually download the mp3s From people who don't properly set up their id3s or do it through lights never been different.

329
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:18,312
Scott: That's never.

330
00:22:18,373 --> 00:22:21,565
Scott: if you download something that's not through an RSS feed iTunes thinks it's music.

331
00:22:21,605 --> 00:22:22,750
Scott: It doesn't know it's a fucking podcast.

332
00:22:22,931 --> 00:22:27,350
Rym: So there apparently was a way in every instant earlier to click on it be like no, this is a podcast.

333
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:31,707
Scott: I've never seen that my entire life of using iTunes since the iPod mini was out.

334
00:22:31,747 --> 00:22:32,550
Scott: That's never happened.

335
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,090
Scott: I'll ever see that my life.

336
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:40,310
Rym: I could select the files click on more info and click and change the setting to podcast as if I tunes 11.

337
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,536
Rym: This no longer is an option.

338
00:22:41,797 --> 00:22:43,345
Scott: I've never seen that as an option ever.

339
00:22:43,927 --> 00:22:44,510
Rym: It was an option.

340
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,233
Rym: Who's screenshots?

341
00:22:45,273 --> 00:22:46,579
Scott: people are friggin crazy?

342
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:47,564
Scott: Stop fucking.

343
00:22:47,584 --> 00:22:49,010
Scott: this is the thing about Apple stuff, right?

344
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:50,280
Scott: And I love it and hate it.

345
00:22:50,421 --> 00:22:56,364
Rym: and everyone, you know If you're gonna use it go all-in don't like you were using Apple.

346
00:22:56,404 --> 00:23:00,970
Scott: shit You have to just don't change fucking anything.

347
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:04,069
Scott: Just do it the way they want you to do it and don't fuck around with it.

348
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:09,148
Scott: Right everyone, you know, if you're an option changing customizing kind of person Apple ain't for you, right?

349
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,654
Scott: Don't be using Apple.

350
00:23:10,714 --> 00:23:16,919
Scott: and for me, you know when it comes to phones and this really important thing I carry around all day as open-source II as I am.

351
00:23:16,939 --> 00:23:22,256
Scott: it is a and as openness is a high priority and Freedom is a high priority.

352
00:23:22,296 --> 00:23:25,686
Scott: The higher priority is this thing is really important.

353
00:23:25,747 --> 00:23:26,830
Scott: it better fucking work.

354
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:34,545
Scott: So I don't fuck with it default everything right and when it comes to something else And maybe I don't care much about I don't care if it continues to work right.

355
00:23:34,585 --> 00:23:36,974
Scott: if it breaks big deal It's not so important.

356
00:23:37,355 --> 00:23:38,618
Scott: Yeah, let's fuck around with this.

357
00:23:38,638 --> 00:23:39,621
Scott: That'll be fun times.

358
00:23:39,842 --> 00:23:42,650
Scott: So I tunes pretty important my phone.

359
00:23:43,012 --> 00:23:43,818
Scott: I don't fuck with it.

360
00:23:43,858 --> 00:23:45,550
Scott: Just do it the way it's supposed to be used.

361
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,808
Scott: Don't go and looking for weird options cuz you know what?

362
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:52,525
Scott: Huh this I use this unsupported feature and then I complain when they took it away from me.

363
00:23:52,585 --> 00:23:56,535
Scott: when I find weird hack no longer works Curses, it's like they didn't.

364
00:23:56,675 --> 00:23:57,438
Scott: it was a weird hack.

365
00:23:57,659 --> 00:23:58,864
Scott: It was not promised to work.

366
00:23:58,924 --> 00:24:00,550
Scott: It wasn't a feature, right?

367
00:24:01,613 --> 00:24:03,450
Scott: And they didn't promise to even keep their features.

368
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,590
Scott: So, of course, they didn't promise to keep their weird hacks.

369
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:20,926
Scott: The point is iTunes 11 regardless of its graphical updates, which I kind of okay with the windows version Which is the one I use is vastly improved because even You know the I never really had a big problem with it before.

370
00:24:20,946 --> 00:24:21,889
Scott: it was crashy.

371
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:36,229
Scott: It would crash it flake out the I would have problems with it such as I would try to do like the music streaming through iTunes from my PC to my HD PC and it was like sometimes just stop and had to restart iTunes to make it work again stuff like that.

372
00:24:36,871 --> 00:24:40,099
Scott: Now all that stuff just works perfectly every time.

373
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:45,570
Scott: it's way faster and it never crashes and it's so perfect and Life is very pleasant.

374
00:24:46,272 --> 00:24:57,328
Scott: So if you're one of those iTunes Haiti people and you can get over, you know Whatever weird customization and organization OCD thing you have to do and just let iTunes do what it wants to do.

375
00:24:57,388 --> 00:24:59,194
Scott: and you know Buy into it.

376
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:02,486
Scott: It is vastly improved with its no crashy.

377
00:25:02,547 --> 00:25:03,410
Scott: No flakiness.

378
00:25:04,391 --> 00:25:05,253
Scott: So there you go.

379
00:25:05,955 --> 00:25:07,900
Rym: So last thing a very brief news.

380
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,227
Rym: Here's a guy on the internet s slash dot.

381
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:14,959
Rym: Oh Say to DVD drives that don't suck for CD ripping.

382
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:21,759
Rym: He needs a modern CD drive to rip his MP By the $20 one on Newegg.

383
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:31,350
Rym: Yeah, so basically what he's pointing out is that Modern like new say to CD ROMs are way way slower than old ones.

384
00:25:31,753 --> 00:25:33,710
Rym: There's not as well made I believe as well.

385
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:36,020
Rym: They keep rereading and he and he goes on and on.

386
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,230
Rym: he proves it's a problem and I have his answer right here.

387
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:41,221
Rym: I believe it have ripped all your CDs to mp3 15 years ago.

388
00:25:41,241 --> 00:25:41,522
Rym: I agree.

389
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:50,730
Rym: Optionally, it is faster to go to Pirate Bay than it is to rip a single CD depending on your internet connection.

390
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:58,811
Rym: Yes, I'd argue that almost all modern internet connections are faster than ripping a CD - All right.

391
00:25:58,831 --> 00:25:59,656
Scott: What else is that's it?

392
00:25:59,736 --> 00:26:01,628
Rym: I just found this the whole thing kind of funny.

393
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:03,457
Rym: I mean I have an optical drive.

394
00:26:03,538 --> 00:26:09,945
Scott: Yeah, and you know what my 32 X whatever Sata CD, you know say to DVD rom, whatever.

395
00:26:09,965 --> 00:26:11,250
Scott: Yeah, it might be kind of slow.

396
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:17,890
Scott: It's ripping a CD compared to maybe my Plex store 8 for 32 Which was you know, probably the best at it, right?

397
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:23,089
Scott: Cuz even though it's burning was not the great the 32 burning that written speed hasn't really increased lately.

398
00:26:24,651 --> 00:26:34,867
Scott: And yet no one gives a shit about optical drives now, so they make them way cheap, but you know what it's still Crazy fast compared to my 4x CD rama the olden days.

399
00:26:34,947 --> 00:26:37,498
Scott: It's like oh no It's five minutes instead of three minutes.

400
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:43,530
Rym: Well, I don't need optical drives anymore And I need I need to use an optical driver in my laptop for one thing.

401
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,197
Rym: So I'm gonna buy like a USB.

402
00:26:45,377 --> 00:26:52,490
Scott: if you're ripping that many CDs to mp3 that the time matters That you care that much about it and you're not willing to just go to Pirate Bay and download it.

403
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,176
Rym: You really should have done it ten years ago.

404
00:26:54,277 --> 00:26:55,903
Scott: Yes, but you could just buy.

405
00:26:55,923 --> 00:26:57,830
Scott: and you're willing to buy optical drives.

406
00:26:58,313 --> 00:27:05,330
Scott: just buy the really expensive one or Instead of the $20 one or buy one of those really tall things.

407
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:10,065
Scott: There's a whole bunch of CD drives and it meant for you know, mass burning and just use it for mass ripping.

408
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,335
Rym: I Also suspect though.

409
00:27:12,355 --> 00:27:18,810
Rym: I didn't really read, you know all his stuff too deeply But he's trying to use flak and he might have some other IO bottle.

410
00:27:19,252 --> 00:27:20,437
Scott: Well, it depends that.

411
00:27:20,518 --> 00:27:27,466
Scott: I haven't looked at this guy's tests for speed it You know, he could be a dumbass and it could be his encoding that is slow and not his ripping.

412
00:27:27,727 --> 00:27:28,490
Rym: that is possible.

413
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:30,503
Rym: But anyway, I just thought this was kind of funny.

414
00:27:30,744 --> 00:27:34,236
Scott: so yeah, oh Man, the new floppy drives.

415
00:27:34,296 --> 00:27:35,179
Scott: I just bought one.

416
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:36,062
Scott: It's so slow.

417
00:27:36,122 --> 00:27:38,510
Scott: I can't save the data off all my floppies.

418
00:27:38,912 --> 00:27:39,457
Rym: Oh my god.

419
00:27:39,477 --> 00:27:42,048
Rym: I wonder if any of my floppies are still readable.

420
00:27:43,651 --> 00:27:45,867
Rym: Cloppies were really susceptible to bit rot.

421
00:27:45,907 --> 00:27:47,472
Scott: some Probably.

422
00:27:47,552 --> 00:27:48,755
Scott: maybe some files be bad.

423
00:27:48,795 --> 00:27:49,638
Scott: Maybe some will work.

424
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:50,681
Rym: I've got one somewhere.

425
00:27:50,701 --> 00:27:53,609
Rym: that's got my old hack copy of stunts 40 racing.

426
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:57,603
Scott: I have a USB three and a half inch floppy drive cracked by killer fit.

427
00:27:57,904 --> 00:27:58,566
Scott: I have a drive.

428
00:27:58,627 --> 00:28:08,114
Rym: we can do it anyway, it's Things of the day.

429
00:28:08,154 --> 00:28:15,715
Rym: if you've never seen an old Silly Symphony and I'll bet many young kids haven't check this out Silly Symphony Music land.

430
00:28:15,816 --> 00:28:28,551
Rym: This is a wonderful little 9 minute and 12 second animated short from 1935 where the island of jazz and the island of symphonic music have a deathmatch to the death Mmm.

431
00:28:29,053 --> 00:28:33,169
Rym: and the top comment asks if there is in fact a land of metal there should be.

432
00:28:33,811 --> 00:28:34,494
Scott: Someone should remain.

433
00:28:34,514 --> 00:28:39,852
Rym: someone's gotta add to animate metal and and just mash it up with this video Electronically.

434
00:28:40,113 --> 00:28:50,730
Rym: what I find funny is the weird old sensibilities from 1935 that The guys flirts with the girl basically by chasing her around while she tries to get away from him.

435
00:28:51,033 --> 00:28:52,349
Scott: Yeah, you see that.

436
00:28:52,491 --> 00:28:54,210
Scott: Welcome to every Pepe Le Pew ever.

437
00:28:54,772 --> 00:29:01,614
Rym: Also the fact that this is almost a hundred years old and it might as well have been made today other than the sensibilities is Kind of amazing.

438
00:29:01,674 --> 00:29:01,794
Rym: Yeah.

439
00:29:02,055 --> 00:29:05,610
Scott: Well, I mean the big thing to take away from this is something we already all should all know.

440
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:11,065
Scott: Right is like look our great-grandparents only like classical music and her grandparents like jazz music.

441
00:29:11,105 --> 00:29:12,810
Scott: and they said that jazz music is the devil.

442
00:29:13,092 --> 00:29:16,390
Scott: And then the grandparents told our parents that rock music is the devil.

443
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:21,684
Scott: Dub step is not not like our jazz music that rock music is the devil.

444
00:29:21,724 --> 00:29:27,403
Scott: and then our pair some of the parents with the rock Music learned the lesson but some of the other ones were like that rap music is the devil.

445
00:29:27,464 --> 00:29:29,955
Scott: and then now you've got that dub Step is the devil.

446
00:29:30,156 --> 00:29:30,982
Scott: Come on people.

447
00:29:31,224 --> 00:29:32,110
Rym: All right, can't figure it.

448
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:35,722
Rym: So everyone only lives through one cycle of it.

449
00:29:35,883 --> 00:29:36,385
Scott: some people.

450
00:29:36,546 --> 00:29:38,736
Scott: I've figured it out Some people have figured it out.

451
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:51,325
Scott: No matter how many children I have been zero or a billion I will never tell any punk kids that the dub step or the rap step or the 10 Whatever, whatever crazy bullshit music there is.

452
00:29:51,345 --> 00:29:57,323
Scott: when I'm a 90 year Yeah, when I'm a 90 year old man, whatever the kids are listening to is gonna be awesome.

453
00:29:57,644 --> 00:30:01,736
Rym: Oh My god, it's all over my pop filter.

454
00:30:01,896 --> 00:30:04,064
Scott: So the my thing of the day.

455
00:30:04,084 --> 00:30:05,690
Rym: I got dub step all over my pop.

456
00:30:05,751 --> 00:30:06,328
Scott: That's great.

457
00:30:07,651 --> 00:30:11,310
Scott: This guy named the whistler on YouTube.

458
00:30:12,581 --> 00:30:20,850
Scott: He mashed up My favorite one of my favorite games ice hockey for the NES and he changed it into lockout hockey as is appropriate.

459
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:23,405
Rym: So wait, he mashed up ice hockey with ice hockey.

460
00:30:23,526 --> 00:30:24,169
Scott: That is right.

461
00:30:26,013 --> 00:30:28,009
Scott: So you should watch this here video.

462
00:30:28,812 --> 00:30:33,003
Scott: It is a good video of funniness and ice hockey in the meta moment.

463
00:30:33,043 --> 00:30:35,670
Rym: The book club book is the great Gatsby.

464
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:38,519
Rym: You probably have some time to read it.

465
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:40,850
Rym: I have a feeling we're not doing that show until early next year.

466
00:30:41,011 --> 00:30:42,279
Scott: Yeah, next year not do.

467
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:48,690
Scott: probably after the mag MAGFest which is another thing to talk about in the meta moment is actually soon now.

468
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,655
Rym: Oh my god, mag fest is coming.

469
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:52,059
Rym: It is right after New Year's.

470
00:30:52,099 --> 00:30:54,505
Scott: Mag best is near Washington DC.

471
00:30:54,826 --> 00:30:58,736
Scott: It is four days 24/7 no nights off.

472
00:30:59,118 --> 00:31:02,210
Scott: It is Thursday morn through Sunday night.

473
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:09,029
Rym: They have a physical arcade the size of a football field gaming gaming gaming gaming music concerts concerts concerts.

474
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:19,864
Rym: year We started a handful of panels at midnight and finished five in the morning and then passed out gaming gaming gaming drinking panels concerts not stopping for days.

475
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:25,570
Scott: Why are you not going to mag fest if you are listening to the show?

476
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,957
Rym: I like mag fest almost as much as packs.

477
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:31,490
Rym: They're different, but they both are crucial to my enjoyment.

478
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:38,633
Scott: They're like the two sides of what gaming cons might only regret not going to mag fest sooner because I didn't know about it sooner than I went to.

479
00:31:38,693 --> 00:31:42,347
Scott: it is not going to pack sooner and not having the money to go to pack.

480
00:31:42,387 --> 00:31:48,510
Rym: not going to pack sooner is literally One of two things in my entire life that I regret anyway.

481
00:31:50,411 --> 00:31:54,045
Rym: Other meta moment we have an official counter-strike server counter-strike go.

482
00:31:54,085 --> 00:31:55,410
Rym: I'm gonna add some new maps to it.

483
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,580
Rym: You kids should be playing on it.

484
00:31:56,661 --> 00:31:57,589
Rym: It's pretty tight.

485
00:31:58,232 --> 00:32:17,612
Scott: I'm about to send the newsletter again, and I think I'm gonna send it with this other thing That is not MailChimp But is made by the MailChimp people because it's way simpler and easier to do than MailChimp But it's run by the same people's and so, you know, don't freak out at the at the next newsletter looks different Whatever.

486
00:32:17,973 --> 00:32:23,389
Rym: All right, and of course a PAX East a ways out but enforcer applications just went up.

487
00:32:23,811 --> 00:32:30,450
Scott: So it since it's almost entirely sold out if not entirely sold out and you want to go Enforcing is a great choice.

488
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:37,730
Scott: In fact, I plan to do it for the first time ever so that my foot will go in doing the walking to match my mouth.

489
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,774
Scott: That has done the talking.

490
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:40,761
Rym: Yes, Scott and I promised long ago.

491
00:32:40,882 --> 00:32:44,636
Rym: Someday we'll enforce so we're putting On shit talking.

492
00:32:44,737 --> 00:32:46,970
Scott: Also, I've spent you know at the last PAX East.

493
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:50,830
Scott: I spent a lot of time doing stuff that yeah, you know, I could have enforced.

494
00:32:51,352 --> 00:32:53,922
Rym: Yeah, I feel like I want to do everything.

495
00:32:53,962 --> 00:32:56,130
Scott: I had a couple free hours at the last PAX East.

496
00:32:56,231 --> 00:33:02,116
Rym: So if I enforce it's gonna be jam-packed this time I'm gonna see PAX East, well PAX, from every possible angle.

497
00:33:02,156 --> 00:33:15,152
Scott: Also, I can get food in enforcer land instead of having to go to get food at the horrible food locations Near PAX East which is the you know, a great great idea All right.

498
00:33:15,232 --> 00:33:21,290
Scott: So so yeah Rym had this show idea and I poo-pooed it, but I'm gonna let him do it anyway.

499
00:33:21,996 --> 00:33:28,990
Scott: And so if you like this show Then we'll just let Rym pick Monday show ideas and do them even if I poo-poo them because apparently he's right about what you want.

500
00:33:29,713 --> 00:33:33,410
Scott: But if you don't like the show you think it's boring or it doesn't get a lot of listens or whatever.

501
00:33:33,975 --> 00:33:35,690
Scott: Then I was right and we're right to poop.

502
00:33:37,351 --> 00:33:38,775
Rym: What should we have done this show on?

503
00:33:38,896 --> 00:33:43,570
Scott: we should have just sat around watching the Giants games about to start in an hour and a half.

504
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:44,012
Rym: You know what?

505
00:33:44,032 --> 00:33:47,728
Rym: I feel we should do if we don't have Monday topics just do the news thing of the day.

506
00:33:47,748 --> 00:33:50,215
Rym: in the end It's still a show.

507
00:33:50,235 --> 00:34:01,100
Rym: the news that our discussion of the news on GeekNights Mondays is relevant and that tech news is in fact 90% of what anyone cares about in the tech world.

508
00:34:01,501 --> 00:34:02,544
Rym: other than how to.

509
00:34:02,605 --> 00:34:04,230
Scott: why don't we just make to it anyway?

510
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:11,918
Scott: send in Monday Ideas to the forum or our email.

511
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:16,190
Scott: GeekNights at front recruit calm or Twitter or Facebook or Google+ or whatever you got.

512
00:34:16,311 --> 00:34:29,530
Rym: so I've realized over the course of my Project management and design and IT over the years that I know a lot about networking and You know a lot about that networking thing most during you pay a lot of money to have a degree in it.

513
00:34:29,811 --> 00:34:36,570
Rym: What's funny is despite being an expert at networking to the lowest level I can talk about how?

514
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:44,246
Rym: Bullshit is encoded on different types of Ethernet at the physical level of how you make a one and how you make a zero All the way up to switches and all that.

515
00:34:45,556 --> 00:34:47,149
Rym: That was a big part of education RIT.

516
00:34:48,551 --> 00:34:51,726
Rym: Never really done that as my job, but you didn't work at Verizon.

517
00:34:52,108 --> 00:34:55,783
Scott: you worked It's you know the hospital and the other places even at the hospital.

518
00:34:55,884 --> 00:34:57,350
Rym: I didn't really do it.

519
00:34:57,591 --> 00:34:59,441
Rym: I just told other people what to do.

520
00:34:59,763 --> 00:35:00,407
Rym: like it's funny.

521
00:35:00,447 --> 00:35:16,189
Rym: at RIT I took a class where we had a mock house And we ran cables and learned about like how to deal with power cables versus ethernet cables and how to like architect all this stuff and differences and server closet placement and the architecture.

522
00:35:16,209 --> 00:35:18,837
Rym: and Yeah, all that actual work.

523
00:35:18,877 --> 00:35:22,110
Rym: That's really fun to do gets outsourced to people who get paid barely minimum wage.

524
00:35:22,391 --> 00:35:24,725
Scott: Well, you have the degree you know how to do this.

525
00:35:24,987 --> 00:35:25,510
Scott: grunt leave.

526
00:35:25,731 --> 00:35:29,150
Scott: That's the fun stuff, and then you could go be a grunt labor.

527
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:32,730
Scott: You could not gone to college have been like a plumber and done all kinds of fun stuff.

528
00:35:33,051 --> 00:35:34,696
Scott: It's only fun when it's made a lot of money.

529
00:35:34,877 --> 00:35:38,208
Scott: Yeah, but you'd be working like crazy because everyone's got fucking fucked up.

530
00:35:38,248 --> 00:35:44,970
Rym: toilets You know network cables through data centers at IBM and at that hospital, and I've dealt with all that stuff to a degree.

531
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:47,230
Rym: But I've never really done networking.

532
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:51,444
Rym: I've never set up a router or switch as part of my job.

533
00:35:51,725 --> 00:35:53,370
Scott: most people have them set up already.

534
00:35:53,431 --> 00:36:04,009
Scott: That's a big part of the problem Is by the time you learned how to set them up they had already set most of them up And they are not offed replaced, so I have a project going on at my with my work.

535
00:36:04,049 --> 00:36:10,920
Rym: right now We're making a a network sniffer to read something called the fixed protocol Which is a favorite.

536
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,370
Rym: I thought it's a big part of my life.

537
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,519
Rym: I'm a member of the fixed protocol board.

538
00:36:14,659 --> 00:36:25,213
Rym: You know like or they're like the company the the consortium W3 of fix the league the consortium that like makes the fixed protocol writes the specs for it and everything I Speak at these.

539
00:36:25,233 --> 00:36:26,519
Rym: you know conventions about it.

540
00:36:26,801 --> 00:36:33,911
Rym: I'm actually going to Istanbul probably Soonish to probably teach people there how to use it Mmm.

541
00:36:34,272 --> 00:36:36,059
Rym: I feel like we should do a show on that sometime.

542
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,184
Scott: the thing nobody cares about.

543
00:36:37,364 --> 00:36:38,629
Rym: yeah, you think no one cares about it.

544
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,901
Scott: What can I learn from the results of this show?

545
00:36:41,962 --> 00:36:43,127
Scott: whether the poo poos are

546
00:36:45,031 --> 00:36:52,881
Rym: I'll say this one if you know the fixed protocol and are also a programmer It's pretty easy to get a relatively high-paying job in the financial

547
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:58,458
Scott: program, or it's relatively easy to get a job period To live in New York or San Francisco if

548
00:36:58,498 --> 00:37:05,324
Rym: you know the fixed protocol, but again you have to be willing to live in New York Maybe Chicago or you know Sao

549
00:37:05,344 --> 00:37:05,706
Scott: Paulo.

550
00:37:05,726 --> 00:37:06,430
Scott: They have commodity.

551
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:11,869
Rym: Yeah the CBOE the CBOE yep anyway anyway, so here's what we need.

552
00:37:12,573 --> 00:37:15,230
Rym: We have a thing that'll read these fixed logs.

553
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:17,519
Rym: So you know the fixed protocol is kind of like middleware.

554
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,126
Rym: think of it that way like TibRV or whatever.

555
00:37:19,166 --> 00:37:21,119
Rym: you're sending messages Back and forth.

556
00:37:21,179 --> 00:37:22,490
Rym: It's like a point-to-point protocol.

557
00:37:22,731 --> 00:37:30,504
Rym: It's like HTTP, but for stock trading and you have an engine on either end that Deals with the fixed bullshit, and then gives your application the data.

558
00:37:30,584 --> 00:37:32,090
Rym: It needs like here's an order.

559
00:37:32,411 --> 00:37:39,077
Scott: Yes, so the application is like the web browser and the engine is like Apache But for fix instead of for HTTP.

560
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:44,650
Rym: so in the financial world unlike for example in HTTP I trust my application.

561
00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:46,809
Rym: I never Give one shit.

562
00:37:47,211 --> 00:37:52,370
Rym: What went over the wire like what my get request looked like unless I'm troubleshooting like a problem with my own web server.

563
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,824
Scott: Well, I do if I'm a developer right, but you don't care if you're a user.

564
00:37:56,225 --> 00:38:01,403
Rym: so in the financial world The users actually care too because they have an order management system an OMS.

565
00:38:01,423 --> 00:38:07,467
Scott: the thing that the stock trader sits there Because you know because of my website visiting fucks up.

566
00:38:07,487 --> 00:38:08,050
Scott: Oh big deal.

567
00:38:09,151 --> 00:38:11,682
Rym: It's the Book of Mormon for an hour until we fix it well.

568
00:38:11,742 --> 00:38:12,968
Scott: No that's serving fucks up.

569
00:38:12,988 --> 00:38:13,510
Scott: That's a big deal.

570
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:15,066
Scott: I'm taking my website visiting mess up.

571
00:38:15,106 --> 00:38:15,430
Scott: No one cares.

572
00:38:15,591 --> 00:38:17,629
Rym: I can't buy tickets to Book of Mormon for an hour.

573
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:22,243
Scott: But stock trading messes up both people on both ends.

574
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:26,368
Scott: give a lot of fucks all the fucks If that shit doesn't work.

575
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:33,546
Scott: Sometimes more fucks than are necessary, but yeah, I'm just saying they give all the fucks if money has a problem.

576
00:38:33,586 --> 00:38:45,505
Rym: I gave a somewhat controversial discussion on a panel in Mumbai a while ago where I said that a lot of the things that people talk about in terms of Like latency and these connections don't actually matter and a lot of people really liked it.

577
00:38:45,525 --> 00:38:46,709
Rym: a lot of people really didn't like it.

578
00:38:47,633 --> 00:38:48,978
Rym: Anyway, that's neither here nor there.

579
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,557
Rym: so the users of this stuff actually care What went over the wire?

580
00:38:53,637 --> 00:38:55,305
Rym: because say my order management system?

581
00:38:55,406 --> 00:38:56,170
Rym: I'm like yeah?

582
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:59,304
Rym: I want to send a new order and then I net like nothing happens.

583
00:38:59,364 --> 00:39:02,042
Rym: my order like looks like it's open But I never get any executions.

584
00:39:02,062 --> 00:39:02,748
Rym: I'm like what the fuck.

585
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:16,483
Rym: So it'd be really nice if I knew what happened because a lot of order management systems suck or something might go wrong Like my order might not actually get acknowledged or some like border fixed engine acknowledges it But then for whatever reason like downstream.

586
00:39:16,523 --> 00:39:17,870
Rym: They don't actually do anything with it.

587
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:26,034
Rym: Yeah, shit like that happens, so I'd like to be able to see you know kind of in real time the actual individual fixed messages Which you know.

588
00:39:26,295 --> 00:39:30,890
Rym: my life for many years working as a production engineer for like an algorithmic trading shop.

589
00:39:31,771 --> 00:39:37,089
Rym: I would just you know grab and said and tail log files and tell traders what they needed to know.

590
00:39:37,934 --> 00:39:41,050
Rym: But that's really expensive to hire someone like me to do something like that.

591
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:44,170
Scott: And it's also how much coverage can you get right that log files pride?

592
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:46,478
Scott: Gigantic how much did you miss?

593
00:39:46,739 --> 00:39:49,110
Scott: you know you're grepping and setting looking for specific things?

594
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:51,138
Rym: I don't miss anything cuz I'm a fucking badass at this.

595
00:39:51,219 --> 00:39:53,770
Scott: I'm just saying you know people looking for specific things.

596
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:56,700
Scott: You're not watching every single log line 24/7 right.

597
00:39:57,042 --> 00:39:59,390
Rym: well that that's a whole separate discussion of monitoring.

598
00:39:59,551 --> 00:40:04,857
Scott: So say I have well, that's what looking at log files is yeah, but any well But you want to automate that shit.

599
00:40:04,977 --> 00:40:07,850
Rym: of course you want to have in the minimum you want to process.

600
00:40:08,011 --> 00:40:13,640
Rym: That's like tailing the log with a regular expression looking for like a log for J Error and sending you an email.

601
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:15,190
Scott: that's a good idea like step.

602
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,817
Rym: That's like babies first, but anyway.

603
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:25,453
Rym: so the fixed protocol people who aren't Technologists like me are the ones who really need to see those messages like the traders themselves Mmm-hmm.

604
00:40:25,935 --> 00:40:28,003
Rym: also the compliance people like you know.

605
00:40:28,043 --> 00:40:29,690
Rym: they want to know if there's malfeasance.

606
00:40:29,771 --> 00:40:32,130
Rym: They want to know what's going on on the wire.

607
00:40:32,311 --> 00:40:34,080
Rym: You know they want to keep archives and records and all this.

608
00:40:34,543 --> 00:40:38,447
Rym: so one way we do this We have a little agent that'll read these log files from.

609
00:40:38,528 --> 00:40:41,984
Rym: you know The where the log files are written the law that engine logs.

610
00:40:42,426 --> 00:40:46,642
Scott: I sent this message I got but then you're trusting the engine to write the logs that are correct.

611
00:40:46,662 --> 00:40:53,030
Scott: the engine could if someone can write a devious engine That sends one thing over the network and log something different, so you're looking for malfeasance.

612
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:56,801
Scott: It actually it wasn't malfeasance, but it was.

613
00:40:56,881 --> 00:40:57,904
Scott: but it doesn't say it was.

614
00:40:58,085 --> 00:41:03,239
Rym: so that is one thing That is actually not much of a concern really okay, not at all.

615
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:07,009
Rym: and sometimes you just some engines don't actually write these log files.

616
00:41:07,773 --> 00:41:13,939
Rym: Say performance say you're sending so many messages per Millisecond that you don't have enough disk.

617
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:16,045
Rym: I owe to write them all out to disk.

618
00:41:16,427 --> 00:41:17,490
Scott: you just got to get more disk.

619
00:41:17,651 --> 00:41:20,403
Rym: Yeah, but if you what if you hit your limitations?

620
00:41:20,543 --> 00:41:21,970
Scott: Amazon actually sells disk.

621
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:23,054
Scott: I hope you get you.

622
00:41:23,094 --> 00:41:28,865
Scott: type in the number of like IO ops per second you want And you pay more money the bigger the number is.

623
00:41:28,885 --> 00:41:33,650
Rym: so anyway Let's say that you know even if I have the thing that's gonna read these fixed logs.

624
00:41:33,751 --> 00:41:36,409
Rym: Let's assume that they're legit, and I don't have to worry about that stuff.

625
00:41:37,351 --> 00:41:39,340
Rym: There's still the possibility of you know impact.

626
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,648
Rym: Let's say I'm running this thing on a you know a server That's doing real stock trading.

627
00:41:42,689 --> 00:41:49,430
Rym: well That's one more process taking up however much RAM it takes up using CPU cycles Sending stuff out over a network to somewhere.

628
00:41:50,071 --> 00:41:53,570
Rym: So maybe I want to get this stuff over the network too, so I go to some developers.

629
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:55,498
Rym: I'm like here's the spec make a network sniffer.

630
00:41:55,538 --> 00:41:57,346
Rym: Just to read this stuff directly off the network.

631
00:41:57,486 --> 00:41:59,512
Scott: well you basically take Wireshark.

632
00:41:59,652 --> 00:42:00,937
Scott: you take you go to wireshark.

633
00:42:00,957 --> 00:42:03,587
Scott: you find the code for putting the ethernet in promiscuous.

634
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,255
Rym: I was about to ask you How would you do this?

635
00:42:05,516 --> 00:42:07,146
Rym: well as a programmer?

636
00:42:07,186 --> 00:42:07,930
Rym: Here's your project?

637
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:11,310
Rym: I want you, and I give you some basic parameters like how this is gonna work.

638
00:42:11,671 --> 00:42:19,516
Rym: I want you to be able to sniff an arbitrary network interface or multiples read data payloads.

639
00:42:19,536 --> 00:42:28,510
Rym: you know the top level the payload of the TCP IP packet yeah and parse it Mm-hmm log it somewhere and send it on to a server to do more bullshit.

640
00:42:28,751 --> 00:42:29,738
Scott: Well, there's two ways to do it.

641
00:42:29,878 --> 00:42:34,281
Scott: one way is if I'm on the server That's doing the communicating is it's a Linux server.

642
00:42:34,582 --> 00:42:35,586
Rym: You're not gonna be on the server.

643
00:42:35,606 --> 00:42:36,470
Rym: That's doing the communicating.

644
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:39,421
Rym: Because otherwise, what's the fucking point?

645
00:42:39,481 --> 00:42:41,550
Rym: the point of this is that it's not impacting.

646
00:42:41,731 --> 00:42:45,208
Scott: I have it on some other device, okay, so I put on another device.

647
00:42:45,228 --> 00:42:53,857
Rym: yep Assume you have Effectively unlimited resources like you have the most powerful like normal like to you server You're gonna share whatever.

648
00:42:54,240 --> 00:43:00,342
Scott: I had to plug it in Very close to in fact exactly next to the server that I'm not allowed to be on.

649
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:06,882
Scott: right so close in fact that all the packets That are going to that computer also go to my computer because they're on the same hub.

650
00:43:07,123 --> 00:43:09,914
Scott: or if it's such thing as hubs Well, then you have to.

651
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:13,170
Scott: you have to go and connect the switch so that the two ports are hubbed.

652
00:43:14,035 --> 00:43:14,538
Scott: So it's a fit.

653
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:15,905
Rym: so although that's not how that works.

654
00:43:15,986 --> 00:43:16,650
Scott: so the switch.

655
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,166
Scott: You know when you can.

656
00:43:18,206 --> 00:43:20,757
Scott: yeah Cuz you normally what a switch does it fig?

657
00:43:20,857 --> 00:43:25,333
Scott: once it figures out which port certain packets belong to it only sends them down that Port.

658
00:43:25,676 --> 00:43:30,982
Scott: but you can tell the switch hey Anything that's going to port to send it to port one also.

659
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:33,330
Rym: That's not the same as making them like a hub.

660
00:43:33,951 --> 00:43:41,250
Rym: Uh-huh, if they were like a hub then you the third party that's sniffing could theoretically send a message to that network segment.

661
00:43:42,211 --> 00:43:43,437
Rym: But now that's not how we do this.

662
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:43,818
Rym: we do.

663
00:43:43,879 --> 00:43:46,290
Rym: we do something called a port span, okay, so how is that?

664
00:43:46,971 --> 00:43:47,553
Scott: How is that not?

665
00:43:47,594 --> 00:43:50,930
Rym: so what that basically does is just sends a copy of everything that goes over?

666
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:55,305
Rym: One or more arbitrary ports to your report, but you can't talk back.

667
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:57,575
Scott: Oh So it's not exactly hub.

668
00:43:57,636 --> 00:43:58,439
Scott: I can't say anything.

669
00:43:58,479 --> 00:43:59,082
Scott: I just listen.

670
00:43:59,122 --> 00:44:00,810
Scott: Oh, yeah, and the thing is only listening.

671
00:44:00,911 --> 00:44:02,723
Rym: Yes, and saying stuff wouldn't help you anyway.

672
00:44:02,763 --> 00:44:03,649
Scott: How about what I?

673
00:44:05,515 --> 00:44:06,450
Scott: Don't know it wouldn't?

674
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:08,522
Rym: I'm trying to trap you here.

675
00:44:08,703 --> 00:44:14,130
Scott: Yeah, there's no reason I need to talk, but if I'm gonna if I'm hubbed if we were on a hub which doesn't exist anymore

676
00:44:14,311 --> 00:44:14,713
Rym: Yeah, but if

677
00:44:14,754 --> 00:44:18,981
Scott: I got a hub from ten years ago plugged in and put two computers into it I could see everything the other computer does.

678
00:44:19,102 --> 00:44:20,230
Scott: yes in both directions.

679
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:25,090
Scott: So it's that's all I need to do is see every packet that goes to and from the other computer in both directions.

680
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:27,196
Rym: Alright, so say there's you.

681
00:44:27,296 --> 00:44:32,090
Rym: there might be an arbitrary number of different computers on the subnet.

682
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:36,309
Rym: You're listening to all sending fixed traffic, and you want to sniff all of them.

683
00:44:36,551 --> 00:44:37,499
Scott: Well, I can I can.

684
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:51,411
Scott: the same interface well Oh, well I mean is is there enough traffic going over all of those other computers that it's going to completely flood My one Ethernet cable connection of one gigabit Capacity?

685
00:44:51,953 --> 00:44:57,070
Scott: so I mean I can't monitor all of Google's HTTP traffic with one gigabit of bandwidth.

686
00:44:57,352 --> 00:45:00,390
Rym: So let's assume for now that aside from a crazy peak you're fine.

687
00:45:00,551 --> 00:45:03,401
Rym: You can reasonably assume that you will not sell even though.

688
00:45:03,421 --> 00:45:12,808
Scott: so all those packets going to and from all those other computers Right are being copied to my to my computer right, and there's no bandwidth worry whatsoever.

689
00:45:12,828 --> 00:45:16,515
Rym: Yep, none Okay, well yeah And no like median bandwidth.

690
00:45:16,656 --> 00:45:21,650
Scott: now when those packets get copied are the packets being rewritten so that identical?

691
00:45:21,932 --> 00:45:23,728
Scott: So they're not being readdressed to me.

692
00:45:24,111 --> 00:45:26,921
Scott: They're still have the original addresses on them original everything.

693
00:45:26,961 --> 00:45:27,764
Rym: so I do last.

694
00:45:27,784 --> 00:45:31,437
Scott: so I do need to put my ethernet card in Promiscuous mode in order to capture them all right.

695
00:45:31,457 --> 00:45:32,682
Rym: Do you know what promiscuous mode does?

696
00:45:32,822 --> 00:45:34,990
Scott: it basically says hey ethernet card usually?

697
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:37,821
Scott: Anytime you see a connection with a MAC address.

698
00:45:37,841 --> 00:45:38,444
Scott: That's not yours.

699
00:45:38,484 --> 00:45:39,690
Scott: you throw that shit in the garbage.

700
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:41,919
Scott: Yep, do not throw that shit in the garbage.

701
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:44,690
Scott: any bits you see touching you at all.

702
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:48,079
Scott: Capture those bits and make them available to my software.

703
00:45:48,099 --> 00:45:50,507
Rym: you want to know some interesting things in token ring networks.

704
00:45:50,687 --> 00:45:54,240
Scott: if you go into Promiscuous mode I did not know token ring had it from excuse matter.

705
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:55,585
Scott: I thought that that was an ethernet thing.

706
00:45:55,927 --> 00:45:58,357
Rym: so you'll basically Basically, no you'll be.

707
00:45:58,398 --> 00:46:00,688
Scott: are there MAC addresses on token rings?

708
00:46:00,709 --> 00:46:00,749
Scott: uh?

709
00:46:02,231 --> 00:46:03,415
Rym: You want to show on token ring.

710
00:46:03,696 --> 00:46:04,639
Rym: talk a lot about.

711
00:46:04,759 --> 00:46:08,290
Scott: no one uses token ring anymore except old places that have cobalt.

712
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:12,583
Rym: You don't have switches or hubs you have MA use yeah multi access unit.

713
00:46:12,663 --> 00:46:21,390
Rym: anyway if you go into promiscuous mode Basically the mile you're connected to could say no fuck you you can't you're not authorized.

714
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:23,250
Scott: well There are ways interesting ways.

715
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:25,645
Scott: I've heard of detecting people who go into promise.

716
00:46:25,665 --> 00:46:31,850
Scott: there are indeed But we don't care of if anyone detects us in promiscuous because really this is our network we're allowed to be.

717
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:33,998
Rym: Yes, your network is in the straightest.

718
00:46:34,018 --> 00:46:34,680
Rym: set up this parts.

719
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,250
Scott: This shit is on fucking purpose right okay?

720
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:48,040
Scott: So step three is I need to write a program similar to wireshark that looks at all those fucking packets hitting my ethernet port and Writes them all the fuck down all right in.

721
00:46:48,181 --> 00:46:50,510
Scott: and do I have enough space to write all these fuckers down?

722
00:46:50,652 --> 00:46:59,326
Scott: Let's say yes, okay I put in so much RAM and hard drive space that I can Write all these down or I can process them fat so fast as they come in.

723
00:46:59,346 --> 00:47:02,658
Scott: I don't need to write them down I can write down my results, and I don't need to.

724
00:47:02,739 --> 00:47:05,470
Scott: you know hold on to them, but so how do you differentiate between?

725
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:08,161
Rym: Say there's two different computers running.

726
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:09,348
Rym: You know whatever this fixed up.

727
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:12,420
Scott: well first I have to filter because remember this is raw network traffic.

728
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:12,601
Scott: right.

729
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:15,090
Scott: yes, this is we're not at the fixed protocol level yet.

730
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:16,515
Rym: Yeah, we're at me right.

731
00:47:16,776 --> 00:47:17,739
Scott: so for example.

732
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:20,730
Scott: There's all these like fucking sins and acts in there and shit.

733
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:25,326
Scott: I just got to get rid of a lot of that garbage and only make some sort of TCP.

734
00:47:25,387 --> 00:47:26,310
Scott: It's TCP IP right.

735
00:47:26,371 --> 00:47:26,936
Scott: It's not UDP.

736
00:47:27,097 --> 00:47:27,783
Rym: It's TCP IP.

737
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:28,510
Scott: okay, so I need to.

738
00:47:29,531 --> 00:47:32,630
Rym: You're already thinking you can rely on your own guaranteed delivery.

739
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:38,110
Scott: No, I'm saying that I'm gonna look at the T. I'm only gonna get rid of any packet.

740
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:39,476
Scott: That's not a TCP IP packet.

741
00:47:39,617 --> 00:47:41,304
Scott: all the IC MPs throw them out.

742
00:47:41,424 --> 00:47:42,690
Scott: You know throw out all this garbage.

743
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:44,297
Scott: I gotta throw out anything.

744
00:47:44,317 --> 00:47:44,859
Scott: I got.

745
00:47:44,979 --> 00:47:46,486
Scott: I know what a fixed header looks like right.

746
00:47:46,506 --> 00:47:48,613
Rym: oh Really it's like.

747
00:47:48,633 --> 00:47:49,217
Rym: so equals fix.

748
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:57,818
Scott: I would create some sort of filters such that only the fixed packets would be seen by my Software and any other kind of packet.

749
00:47:57,918 --> 00:47:59,323
Scott: sins and acts and all the garbage.

750
00:47:59,344 --> 00:48:01,050
Scott: just forget that shit all right now.

751
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:01,750
Rym: Are you gonna?

752
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:02,693
Rym: Do you know how to use the?

753
00:48:03,114 --> 00:48:09,106
Rym: because you have you'll have to abstract a little bit because TCP could theoretically send the same frame multiple times.

754
00:48:10,252 --> 00:48:16,247
Rym: So computer a sends a tease of TCP packet with a fixed message sends five more packets with fixed messages.

755
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:19,664
Rym: the other end Basically says I didn't get any of those.

756
00:48:19,704 --> 00:48:20,329
Rym: send them all again.

757
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:23,830
Scott: Yeah, so you see the same guy again, so I can you know I can remove duplicates.

758
00:48:23,978 --> 00:48:28,218
Scott: Yeah I'm pretty sure ever be a case in the fixed protocol where there would be Intentional duplicate like it was.

759
00:48:28,499 --> 00:48:30,167
Scott: it was sent and acknowledged and sent.

760
00:48:30,187 --> 00:48:30,468
Scott: the same.

761
00:48:30,509 --> 00:48:35,189
Rym: exact Acknowledgments within the protocol are separate from TCP IP.

762
00:48:35,691 --> 00:48:43,650
Scott: Well that is very good because then I can easily determine whether it was an intentional Duplicate or a TCP IP duplicate and any TCP IP level duplicates.

763
00:48:43,992 --> 00:48:46,585
Scott: I could just look and do like an MD a hash of the.

764
00:48:46,746 --> 00:48:49,994
Scott: you know the packets Identical to one I've already got.

765
00:48:50,014 --> 00:48:51,218
Rym: I'm pretty sure.

766
00:48:51,278 --> 00:48:58,823
Rym: I'm pretty sure the Wireshark libraries and the pcap libraries can Abstract out the TCP and just give you the packets that actually made it.

767
00:48:59,004 --> 00:49:00,610
Scott: they can indeed do those things.

768
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:04,423
Scott: I've never gone if I were to utilize their libraries and not write it myself.

769
00:49:04,583 --> 00:49:06,650
Scott: there are many filtering features in Wireshark.

770
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:07,132
Scott: That's pretty much.

771
00:49:07,172 --> 00:49:07,934
Scott: What the fuck it does.

772
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,018
Rym: all right, so do you know?

773
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:09,981
Rym: so what?

774
00:49:10,182 --> 00:49:11,245
Rym: how would you differentiate?

775
00:49:11,305 --> 00:49:12,248
Rym: like say there could be?

776
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:15,640
Rym: Multiple fix engines running on the same machine.

777
00:49:15,721 --> 00:49:18,049
Rym: each one listens on a different port mmm.

778
00:49:18,471 --> 00:49:20,557
Rym: So how do you differentiate all the different?

779
00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:24,630
Rym: like say you want to differentiate the packets from one engine versus another engine?

780
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:26,027
Rym: Do you know the tuple that?

781
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,758
Rym: Defines the TCP IP connection.

782
00:49:28,978 --> 00:49:30,364
Scott: I would look it up in the fucking book.

783
00:49:30,404 --> 00:49:32,050
Scott: I could look at the packets themselves.

784
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:32,672
Rym: I'm just curious.

785
00:49:32,692 --> 00:49:33,154
Rym: You know it.

786
00:49:33,576 --> 00:49:33,737
Scott: No.

787
00:49:33,777 --> 00:49:34,238
Scott: I don't know it.

788
00:49:34,259 --> 00:49:35,142
Scott: I don't do that.

789
00:49:35,383 --> 00:49:37,190
Scott: My job is googling things right.

790
00:49:37,512 --> 00:49:37,894
Scott: I have again.

791
00:49:37,914 --> 00:49:40,950
Scott: I would look at the pet if I had to and I couldn't Google that right.

792
00:49:41,292 --> 00:49:42,582
Rym: Really, it's really simple.

793
00:49:42,622 --> 00:49:43,710
Scott: I would just look at the packets.

794
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:46,662
Scott: I would have one engine send a packet the other engine send a packet.

795
00:49:46,943 --> 00:49:48,710
Scott: go to my little program in Wireshark.

796
00:49:48,911 --> 00:49:51,762
Scott: Look at the both of them, and I would be able to see with my eyeballs.

797
00:49:51,862 --> 00:49:53,207
Scott: Oh, that's the fucking difference right there.

798
00:49:53,247 --> 00:50:05,054
Rym: boom done Alright, so you realize it's actually just the the IPs on both ends Oh, and the ports on both ends okay, and then that was hard the protocol TCP or UDP.

799
00:50:05,274 --> 00:50:06,399
Rym: so big deal.

800
00:50:06,479 --> 00:50:08,306
Rym: yeah nice and easy all right.

801
00:50:08,647 --> 00:50:09,530
Scott: so what I'm partly.

802
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:11,321
Rym: I'm just trying to figure out how much about networking.

803
00:50:11,361 --> 00:50:12,628
Rym: You know this is selfish enough.

804
00:50:13,811 --> 00:50:14,735
Scott: Yeah, to do whatever.

805
00:50:14,755 --> 00:50:16,582
Scott: This isn't the right programs that do network.

806
00:50:16,662 --> 00:50:23,670
Rym: all right, so this is working out, okay, so How would you deal with the situation of a slow subscriber?

807
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:24,774
Rym: So you're reading all these things.

808
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:26,941
Rym: just fine you want to send them off to some other server.

809
00:50:27,323 --> 00:50:30,434
Rym: say that server slows the fuck down Way upstream.

810
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:30,795
Scott: Oh the guy.

811
00:50:30,815 --> 00:50:31,659
Scott: I'm sending them down.

812
00:50:32,121 --> 00:50:33,285
Scott: I just buffer that shit up.

813
00:50:33,506 --> 00:50:34,309
Rym: all right, so what if?

814
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:36,889
Rym: He's down for the whole day.

815
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:38,250
Rym: You're gonna buffer it all in RAM forever.

816
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:42,449
Scott: And just what do you do when you hit when you who is this guy from another company or is it from my company?

817
00:50:42,469 --> 00:50:42,550
Scott: say?

818
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:43,214
Rym: It's your company.

819
00:50:43,536 --> 00:50:44,624
Scott: Oh, so it's my own company.

820
00:50:44,744 --> 00:50:45,469
Rym: It's your own company.

821
00:50:46,231 --> 00:50:49,930
Scott: I just write that shit in some hard drive somewhere all right, so you'd buffer to a file.

822
00:50:50,156 --> 00:50:54,864
Rym: Yeah Would the same thread send the message upstream and write it to the file?

823
00:50:54,884 --> 00:50:56,028
Rym: or would you do some sort of?

824
00:50:56,128 --> 00:50:56,670
Scott: I would have some?

825
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:59,863
Scott: Sort of policy that we would decide on in a meeting probably of like.

826
00:51:00,104 --> 00:51:00,365
Scott: you know.

827
00:51:00,405 --> 00:51:02,395
Scott: hey if the thing is down What do we want to do?

828
00:51:02,435 --> 00:51:02,918
Scott: do we want to?

829
00:51:03,179 --> 00:51:04,950
Scott: how long do you want to retry for an hour?

830
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:05,673
Scott: Do you care?

831
00:51:05,733 --> 00:51:06,456
Scott: how much do you care?

832
00:51:06,516 --> 00:51:09,650
Scott: business guy who actually this matters to what it you know?

833
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:11,250
Scott: This is your thing right?

834
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:13,075
Scott: This is where your business matters.

835
00:51:13,115 --> 00:51:16,669
Scott: if you need this to be automatically sent no matter what then I'll have a thing you know.

836
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:27,390
Scott: We'll come up with a schedule like hey Maybe we'll automatically resend after every hour or you know we'll start trying every five minutes And if it stops working will slow down to hourly will slow down to daily.

837
00:51:27,711 --> 00:51:30,766
Scott: Do you really need me to keep the logs forever like if it's two days old.

838
00:51:30,786 --> 00:51:31,650
Scott: do you even care anymore?

839
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:34,129
Scott: You know maybe I'll just throw them out when they're two days old.

840
00:51:34,371 --> 00:51:38,688
Scott: You know we'll decide on something that makes sense for the business case of what to do.

841
00:51:38,889 --> 00:51:40,770
Rym: all right So what I was getting out with all this?

842
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:45,730
Scott: Maybe we'll do a manual resend or you know if you ask you make a manual request for the log.

843
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:46,734
Scott: I'll email it to you.

844
00:51:46,894 --> 00:51:49,686
Rym: so this kind of wraps up my whole ulterior motive here.

845
00:51:49,706 --> 00:52:14,515
Rym: a Big problem with a lot of people who are young and coming just out of college and getting into industries Whatever they might be programmers everything the separation of duties is actually really important and Unless you're like a startup of one You've the fact the programmer Doesn't only makes arbitrary decisions on the things that matter to the programmer But notice how immediately.

846
00:52:14,535 --> 00:52:17,045
Rym: what Scott's asking me are what are the constraints?

847
00:52:17,125 --> 00:52:18,049
Rym: What does this need to do?

848
00:52:18,571 --> 00:52:20,370
Rym: He's writing it to the business specification.

849
00:52:20,531 --> 00:52:21,394
Rym: That's what matters.

850
00:52:21,575 --> 00:52:25,409
Rym: in the end of course it man what the code is that most people I've met don't get that yet.

851
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:26,857
Scott: Well, I don't.

852
00:52:27,279 --> 00:52:29,330
Rym: they don't think about things in these terms.

853
00:52:29,872 --> 00:52:33,807
Scott: So I just I'm just gonna retry forever and then my computer runs out of memory.

854
00:52:33,827 --> 00:52:36,998
Scott: yeah Great good job.

855
00:52:37,018 --> 00:52:39,350
Rym: Do you know what would you do on a Linux system?

856
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:46,537
Rym: If you if you in var log messages and om was logged at some point it depends on what systems running I mean do I really care?

857
00:52:46,577 --> 00:52:49,910
Scott: I mean if this om something or was already killed on the server, right, okay?

858
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:53,520
Rym: But it's let's say it's the kernel om handler not some individual applications.

859
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:56,930
Scott: om right so the kernel is killing some processes off.

860
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,375
Rym: Do you know how it does that?

861
00:52:58,796 --> 00:53:04,180
Scott: yeah when it runs out of memory it looks at you know has some priority system usually kills Off the biggest fucker.

862
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:05,770
Rym: actually usually it's entirely random.

863
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:08,238
Rym: It kills a random PID and it keeps doing that.

864
00:53:08,378 --> 00:53:13,435
Scott: I've only I've only ever seen the kernel om really go off with my SQL Eating up all the memory.

865
00:53:13,475 --> 00:53:21,624
Scott: I've seen that and it always see and I haven't seen it lately not in a few years But it always killed off my SQL every time The biggest fucker.

866
00:53:22,571 --> 00:53:28,690
Scott: So maybe it picks like a random bit in memory and sees who that bit belongs to and that's how it picks the biggest guy.

867
00:53:28,793 --> 00:53:29,147
Scott: I don't know.

868
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:34,252
Rym: This is the side because the advice I usually give people is if you ever see an om written off our log messages just reboot Cuz.

869
00:53:34,273 --> 00:53:35,570
Rym: there's yeah safe way to recover.

870
00:53:35,711 --> 00:53:39,330
Scott: I would just reboot, but I mean maybe it's you know depending on the business use of that machine.

871
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:42,349
Scott: Maybe there is another process on the machine that is still not killed.

872
00:53:43,492 --> 00:53:44,959
Scott: You care about it, and it killed.

873
00:53:44,999 --> 00:53:49,838
Scott: maybe the thing that got killed with some runaway Crawl here that no one gives a shit about.

874
00:53:49,858 --> 00:53:56,274
Rym: if you want to be a successful technologist in a real company paid Don't just think about.

875
00:53:56,354 --> 00:53:57,578
Rym: you know your silo of.

876
00:53:57,779 --> 00:53:59,103
Rym: I write the code that does this.

877
00:53:59,364 --> 00:53:59,806
Rym: think about.

878
00:53:59,846 --> 00:54:02,618
Rym: you know all the different pieces along the way and do the parts that make sense.

879
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:09,210
Rym: and that seems like simple advice, but People fresh out of college have never worked in these environments seem to have a lot of trouble with that.

880
00:54:09,351 --> 00:54:11,303
Scott: Well the problem the trouble I have is the opposite.

881
00:54:11,363 --> 00:54:16,041
Scott: right is like you know See these issues And I want to talk to these business people.

882
00:54:16,061 --> 00:54:18,394
Scott: you go to the guy who does my job And he doesn't care.

883
00:54:18,415 --> 00:54:26,250
Scott: these people don't care and they're all politics and bullshit And they don't actually care about improving their product, or you know one guy wants one thing one guy wants another thing.

884
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:27,055
Scott: They're contradictory.

885
00:54:27,075 --> 00:54:28,161
Scott: they work for the same company.

886
00:54:28,201 --> 00:54:29,549
Scott: They don't cooperate with each other.

887
00:54:30,252 --> 00:54:31,014
Scott: The guy above.

888
00:54:31,095 --> 00:54:32,680
Scott: both of those guys won't decide.

889
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:34,987
Scott: I'm not allowed to talk to them, or I don't even know who it is.

890
00:54:35,488 --> 00:54:39,990
Scott: you know Everyone just passes the buck and is like why are you talking to me about this low-level bullshit?

891
00:54:40,131 --> 00:54:40,956
Scott: Because they don't want to.

892
00:54:40,977 --> 00:54:58,533
Scott: you know I guess they don't want to micromanage which is good But it's like hey listen you got three people working for you Who are all saying different things and basically fighting over the same resources and want to use them in different ways and they're all Technologically inconsistent and impossible, and it's impossible to appease all of them Physically.

893
00:54:59,034 --> 00:55:10,010
Scott: you need to lay down the law and tell me which one of these people to listen to and also I have suggestions That would you know that you know conflict with all the priorities of these three people who only care about themselves.

894
00:55:10,632 --> 00:55:14,769
Scott: And I got ideas that would actually help the customer who no one seems to give a fuck about but me.

895
00:55:16,851 --> 00:55:18,801
Scott: Should we do what I say or what these people say?

896
00:55:18,901 --> 00:55:20,730
Scott: come on and there's nothing going on.

897
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:26,250
Rym: It just amazes me how many companies just can't manage that and it seems to almost always come down to human drama.

898
00:55:26,731 --> 00:55:27,674
Scott: It is human drama.

899
00:55:27,734 --> 00:55:29,961
Rym: I love working for a relatively small companies.

900
00:55:30,002 --> 00:55:32,590
Rym: now where if that stuff really doesn't happen?

901
00:55:33,272 --> 00:55:36,404
Scott: My place was relatively small, but we got bought.

902
00:55:36,665 --> 00:55:37,830
Scott: yeah seems to happen anywhere.

903
00:55:38,413 --> 00:55:41,049
Rym: Every company I've worked for has been the smallest company I've ever worked for.

904
00:55:42,352 --> 00:55:42,855
Scott: How about that?

905
00:55:43,217 --> 00:55:45,210
Rym: I mean I started with the US federal government.

906
00:55:46,371 --> 00:55:49,624
Scott: So then I went to IBM so you tested how much you know about networking.

907
00:55:49,644 --> 00:55:51,029
Scott: do I know enough about networking?

908
00:55:51,049 --> 00:55:51,210
Scott: yeah?

909
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:52,774
Rym: You know the thing is.

910
00:55:53,396 --> 00:55:55,382
Rym: it's interesting that your first instinct is.

911
00:55:55,422 --> 00:56:00,263
Rym: let me google that I've talked to a bunch of different programmers both Like in my company and other companies.

912
00:56:00,324 --> 00:56:02,680
Rym: I've been asking just friends I know all these same questions.

913
00:56:02,741 --> 00:56:10,230
Rym: just to kind of I'm trying It was an interesting simple question to see the extent to which different programmers know stuff, and here's my conclusion.

914
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:15,412
Rym: RIT computer scientists know more about networking than everyone else in the world I had.

915
00:56:15,853 --> 00:56:21,068
Scott: I had like three networking class except for a certain subclass of old-timers.

916
00:56:21,088 --> 00:56:21,148
Rym: who?

917
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:25,149
Scott: The guys who set up the router that you didn't get the setup because he set it up.

918
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:39,712
Rym: That guy more like the guys who were doing like the generation of coding before we had formalized coding disciplines Who basically had to know everything and they will also look it up if they don't know it like you will of course You know.

919
00:56:40,034 --> 00:56:40,860
Scott: did you know about this?

920
00:56:41,142 --> 00:56:41,867
Scott: the Unix command FC?

921
00:56:45,316 --> 00:56:45,358
Rym: FC.

922
00:56:46,651 --> 00:56:47,413
Rym: Actually, I don't.

923
00:56:47,775 --> 00:56:55,669
Scott: I learned about it yesterday in fact from this book about 21st century coding in C Which also taught me how to use auto tools which I'll tell you about later.

924
00:56:56,251 --> 00:57:02,270
Scott: But yeah, good luck finding the man page for FC because it has the least documentation of any command.

925
00:57:02,971 --> 00:57:06,622
Rym: Man FC built-in runs in a built-in command.

926
00:57:06,682 --> 00:57:14,188
Scott: This isn't even yeah, it is the least Documented command ever, but I'll tell you about it after the show and how crazy useful it is.

927
00:57:15,252 --> 00:57:16,603
Rym: Wait I found it all right.

928
00:57:16,704 --> 00:57:22,770
Scott: That's that's the page I found is the only page I could find documenting this fucker big bash dead daily.

929
00:57:23,051 --> 00:57:24,638
Rym: I'm still doesn't tell me what it does.

930
00:57:24,698 --> 00:57:25,482
Scott: I'll tell you what it does.

931
00:57:25,522 --> 00:57:26,064
Scott: my shows over.

932
00:57:26,325 --> 00:57:27,289
Rym: okay kids look it up.

933
00:57:33,334 --> 00:57:35,870
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

934
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:40,785
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.
