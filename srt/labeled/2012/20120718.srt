1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,615
Rym: It's Wednesday, July 18th, 2012.

2
00:00:10,615 --> 00:00:13,402
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,823 --> 00:00:14,445
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,605 --> 00:00:16,972
Rym: And we're Geek Nites back from ConnectiCon.

5
00:00:17,012 --> 00:00:21,824
Rym: Tonight, the in-call, the epic journey sent to us by Teemo.

6
00:00:23,187 --> 00:00:24,230
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:29,275
Rym: We're back, we're back.

8
00:00:29,315 --> 00:00:30,560
Rym: ConnectiCon was last weekend.

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,548
Rym: My voice is mostly recovered.

10
00:00:32,567 --> 00:00:34,676
Scott: My voice never faded.

11
00:00:34,937 --> 00:00:40,358
Rym: Mine got a little faded by Sunday, but then again, I was running around and putting out, well, actually, you know what?

12
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:46,850
Rym: Compared to previous Kineticons and previous conventions we've been to, there were relatively few troubles to deal with.

13
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:48,134
Scott: Yeah.

14
00:00:48,194 --> 00:00:48,817
Scott: Well, I don't know.

15
00:00:48,857 --> 00:00:51,109
Scott: There wasn't really any big trouble that was involving us.

16
00:00:51,169 --> 00:00:53,678
Scott: I mean, no conventions perfect, but there wasn't anything.

17
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,730
Scott: devastatingly, "Oh no, everything's screwed

18
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:56,991
Scott: up.".

19
00:00:57,011 --> 00:00:58,016
Rym: The con went awesomely.

20
00:00:58,076 --> 00:01:00,125
Rym: The attendance was the most it'd ever been.

21
00:01:00,146 --> 00:01:01,933
Rym: We had more panels than we'd ever had.

22
00:01:01,993 --> 00:01:07,375
Rym: I think we had over 230 panels, workshops, and lectures across 12 rooms for three days.

23
00:01:07,395 --> 00:01:10,551
Rym: I feel particularly accomplished that we were able to pull that off.

24
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:13,620
Rym: And Scott and I single-handedly ran each one of them.

25
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:17,794
Rym: No, but we were the heads of panels and workshops.

26
00:01:17,814 --> 00:01:19,644
Rym: So if you were at ConnectiCon, I hope you had a good time.

27
00:01:20,267 --> 00:01:26,837
Rym: If you're one of those random dudes who complained that there were no good panels, I suggest that you have no idea what you're talking about.

28
00:01:26,918 --> 00:01:31,902
Scott: I suggest you submit some or don't just judge them and decide they're no good based on the title.

29
00:01:31,942 --> 00:01:34,294
Scott: You can't be telling me a panel wasn't good if you didn't go to it.

30
00:01:34,736 --> 00:01:35,017
Rym: Yeah.

31
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:38,875
Rym: The thing is the guy who, there's one guy and I saw him all over the internet.

32
00:01:38,935 --> 00:01:40,103
Rym: Like I think it's the same guy.

33
00:01:40,123 --> 00:01:43,358
Rym: He's the only guy I see who was actually complaining as far as I can tell.

34
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:47,294
Rym: And basically his complaint was there were no good panels.

35
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:51,212
Rym: All I wanted to see was that guy with the glasses and I couldn't get into his thing.

36
00:01:52,496 --> 00:01:55,306
Scott: I think the thing is a lot of, uh, with ConnectiCon, right?

37
00:01:55,948 --> 00:02:03,220
Scott: It's, we have so many panels covering so many different areas that if you're only interested in one area, we don't really have that much for you.

38
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,438
Scott: Like if you're just into manga, it's like how many manga specific panels are there?

39
00:02:07,779 --> 00:02:17,393
Rym: Actually for us, there were almost no manga panels and relatively few anime panels because we got fewer anime panel submissions than we've ever gotten.

40
00:02:17,574 --> 00:02:17,795
Rym: Right.

41
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:30,877
Scott: But it's like, you know, if there's one, if you're only into one nerdery, you've only got a few panels to go to and then you should, if you're, you should either a get into some more geekeries or B spend the rest of the con doing something else or maybe engaging in that geekery.

42
00:02:30,937 --> 00:02:39,042
Rym: I feel like that's not actually a concern because the fact is almost every panel was very well attended.

43
00:02:39,343 --> 00:02:39,564
Scott: Yeah.

44
00:02:40,225 --> 00:02:41,328
Scott: We have notes on everything.

45
00:02:41,348 --> 00:02:41,509
Rym: Yeah.

46
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:43,175
Rym: ConnectiCon went awesomely.

47
00:02:43,456 --> 00:02:44,660
Scott: Too much ConnectiCon discussion.

48
00:02:44,821 --> 00:02:45,343
Scott: Let's move on.

49
00:02:45,564 --> 00:02:51,630
Rym: It was a big part of the last six months of my life and I don't have to worry about it for at least a couple months.

50
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:53,114
Rym: But it was awesome.

51
00:02:53,135 --> 00:03:03,273
Rym: I want to really, uh, give special thanks to Charles Dunbar for coming and doing his thing and a more specifically to Dave Riley and his crew for actually showing up at something.

52
00:03:03,293 --> 00:03:05,019
Scott: I even almost on time.

53
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:07,708
Rym: he showed up, he started his panel on time.

54
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:08,471
Scott: Almost on time.

55
00:03:08,491 --> 00:03:13,117
Rym: What was great is there's a big audience and he gets there and he's like, oh my God, are all these people here to see me?

56
00:03:13,137 --> 00:03:18,041
Rym: And I was like, what have I been saying for the past, I don't know, three years that you should do stuff at cons.

57
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:22,097
Rym: So hopefully there will be more Dave Riley stuff at conventions.

58
00:03:23,181 --> 00:03:24,505
Rym: Uh, yeah, it was awesome.

59
00:03:24,606 --> 00:03:27,819
Rym: We'll review it on some other day in the far flung future.

60
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:36,391
Rym: And if you want to run a panel workshop or lecture at ConnectiCon, we're going to open up submissions for 2013 in a month or two, probably whenever we can.

61
00:03:36,412 --> 00:03:38,780
Scott: Uh, anything else going on?

62
00:03:39,502 --> 00:03:41,770
Rym: But you're the one who wanted to stop talking about ConnectiCon.

63
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,058
Scott: All right, let's talk about something else.

64
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,267
Rym: I guess you had something to say.

65
00:03:44,287 --> 00:03:45,192
Scott: So check this out.

66
00:03:45,232 --> 00:03:45,734
Scott: I'm checking.

67
00:03:46,035 --> 00:03:52,421
Scott: Usually, you know, big time manga creators, you know, they're not the easiest people to, to meet and greet.

68
00:03:52,522 --> 00:03:54,391
Scott: You know, it's like comic creators in the US.

69
00:03:54,411 --> 00:03:56,279
Scott: You can see the artist Ali and such, right?

70
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,303
Scott: Yeah.

71
00:03:57,323 --> 00:04:04,670
Scott: And you know, anime creators, you can see some of them at conventions even in the US, but a manga creator, pretty rare.

72
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,238
Scott: I guess some of them go to manga next.

73
00:04:06,258 --> 00:04:07,062
Scott: Does that still exist?

74
00:04:07,525 --> 00:04:08,068
Rym: I don't know.

75
00:04:08,128 --> 00:04:09,414
Rym: I've never actually been to it.

76
00:04:09,615 --> 00:04:09,856
Scott: Yeah.

77
00:04:10,197 --> 00:04:14,476
Scott: I mean, you know, it's, it's much rarer to find one of them, especially the big name ones.

78
00:04:14,918 --> 00:04:18,434
Scott: But here's the thing that's actually happened in Japan though, but still rare.

79
00:04:18,494 --> 00:04:32,050
Scott: Anyway, the conference of the manga guest of honor of Japan expo Naoki Urasawa took place yesterday, not, not actually yesterday because this article is from July 8th, so July 7th and had great moments in store for the audience of the main stage.

80
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,134
Scott: There's all these pictures here.

81
00:04:33,154 --> 00:04:39,680
Scott: I've been drawing on a gigantic whiteboard and he's actually playing like rocking out and playing music for everybody.

82
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:44,621
Scott: And why don't someone get him to come to the US and do the same thing?

83
00:04:44,681 --> 00:04:57,580
Rym: Well, I remember way back when I was at an amazement, Akira Kamiya was there and not only did he do like the most awesome panels and be the most awesome, like hanging out dude, but one of his panels was a voice acting workshop workshop of how to be a good voice actor.

84
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,118
Rym: And he did a bit of, you want to sound like Ken Shiro and it was pretty awesome.

85
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:02,760
Scott: Right?

86
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,012
Scott: So someone, why hasn't he come to the US yet?

87
00:05:06,032 --> 00:05:07,339
Scott: Someone get him to come here and do a panel.

88
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:07,903
Scott: Jesus Christ.

89
00:05:08,506 --> 00:05:12,643
Rym: You mean come to an anime con in America so five people can see him and be the guest of honor.

90
00:05:12,663 --> 00:05:15,355
Scott: I think more people will see him, right?

91
00:05:15,396 --> 00:05:16,944
Scott: I saw the girl at Kinetic Con this weekend.

92
00:05:17,286 --> 00:05:21,246
Scott: She went to the Namakopia booth and bought the full stack, all 18 volumes of monster.

93
00:05:21,547 --> 00:05:23,154
Scott: She told him, I was like, oh man.

94
00:05:23,174 --> 00:05:25,845
Scott: And she, and she was like, I spent all my money's on this.

95
00:05:25,905 --> 00:05:26,327
Rym: I said that.

96
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,918
Rym: I'm going to make a supposition here.

97
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:34,699
Rym: If we got him to come to Kinetic Con, I think more people would go to his panel than if he were at Otakon.

98
00:05:36,646 --> 00:05:39,798
Scott: I think it would feel like less people at Otakon because the room would be bigger.

99
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,473
Rym: Well, let's assume we put them both in main events.

100
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:45,480
Scott: Oh yeah.

101
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,986
Scott: Then it would, I don't know.

102
00:05:47,226 --> 00:05:47,848
Rym: I, it's hard to say.

103
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:52,706
Rym: I don't, I think they'd be close, but if we did, if you do it on a per capita basis.

104
00:05:52,907 --> 00:05:53,269
Scott: Yeah.

105
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:55,597
Rym: Anyway, mr didn't know what per capita meant.

106
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,264
Scott: I know what per capita meant.

107
00:05:57,404 --> 00:05:57,786
Scott: Did you?

108
00:05:58,007 --> 00:05:58,288
Scott: Yes.

109
00:05:58,529 --> 00:05:59,935
Rym: Does it involve land areas?

110
00:05:59,955 --> 00:06:02,002
Rym: No, I said per capita.

111
00:06:02,082 --> 00:06:02,725
Scott: I know that.

112
00:06:02,785 --> 00:06:07,847
Scott: But the thing is, is that a lot of times people will say per capita, but really they don't know what it means.

113
00:06:07,948 --> 00:06:16,669
Scott: I've seen that happen very often where people will say per capita when they really just mean according to some ratio and they don't really know what the ratio is and they'll just use that word.

114
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,285
Scott: So you can't trust when someone says per capita that they mean per capita.

115
00:06:21,807 --> 00:06:26,785
Rym: I said that you spell potato with an E because I couldn't trust that you didn't know that.

116
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:27,930
Scott: Exactly.

117
00:06:29,111 --> 00:06:30,054
Rym: Don't do Donnie.

118
00:06:30,094 --> 00:06:30,776
Rym: Don't anyway.

119
00:06:30,836 --> 00:06:31,318
Scott: Exactly.

120
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:34,388
Rym: So, uh, Sailor Moon, you know what amazes me.

121
00:06:34,408 --> 00:06:37,420
Rym: at Connecticut, we ran some anime panels.

122
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,770
Rym: because there's so few people submitted anime panels.

123
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,256
Rym: We ran a good chunk of them.

124
00:06:41,336 --> 00:06:43,649
Rym: Charles ran another big chunk of him and that was most of them.

125
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:53,523
Rym: So uh, I mentioned offhandedly during the anime openers from around the world panel, which scarily was identical to the one I ran.

126
00:06:53,543 --> 00:06:57,903
Rym: I don't know every time I've ever run that because it's a backup panel to put on early in the morning.

127
00:06:57,923 --> 00:06:59,733
Scott: But did you actually do beyond candy lane?

128
00:07:00,476 --> 00:07:01,461
Rym: Uh, yeah, I did the whole thing.

129
00:07:01,602 --> 00:07:01,863
Scott: Okay.

130
00:07:01,883 --> 00:07:03,230
Scott: Cause I was like, oh, that happened.

131
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:03,792
Scott: I missed it.

132
00:07:03,812 --> 00:07:04,074
Scott: What?

133
00:07:04,134 --> 00:07:04,536
Scott: Where'd it go?

134
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:05,801
Rym: I videoed it too.

135
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:06,363
Rym: There's proof.

136
00:07:06,765 --> 00:07:07,147
Scott: All right.

137
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:11,047
Rym: All I got to say, those slides, I had not looked at them since the last time we ran that.

138
00:07:11,369 --> 00:07:13,075
Rym: We didn't know what the fuck we were doing back then.

139
00:07:13,115 --> 00:07:14,219
Rym: That is an awful panel.

140
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:17,872
Rym: We're going to rewrite it and redo it.

141
00:07:17,892 --> 00:07:18,675
Scott: I didn't even go to it.

142
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:19,318
Rym: Yeah.

143
00:07:19,358 --> 00:07:20,061
Rym: Room was almost full.

144
00:07:20,964 --> 00:07:23,254
Rym: So anime openers from around the world, right?

145
00:07:23,736 --> 00:07:24,781
Rym: I haven't updated it.

146
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:28,700
Rym: I only scheduled it because I wanted something to be in the schedule at nine 30 in the morning.

147
00:07:28,721 --> 00:07:31,534
Rym: So the other things at nine 30 in the morning didn't feel all lonesome.

148
00:07:31,574 --> 00:07:33,462
Rym: Like the room almost filled.

149
00:07:33,823 --> 00:07:39,182
Rym: half the people there saw it the previous year and when I told them it's the exact same panel, they cheered.

150
00:07:39,203 --> 00:07:41,370
Rym: So that's how it goes.

151
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,064
Rym: So my tool, you could pretty much run the same dubs.

152
00:07:44,104 --> 00:07:45,351
Rym: The time forgot for the next 10 years.

153
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:46,034
Rym: No one would notice.

154
00:07:46,255 --> 00:07:46,959
Scott: Do not do.

155
00:07:47,381 --> 00:07:47,501
Rym: No.

156
00:07:47,562 --> 00:07:49,933
Rym: The fact that Mike does all original content every time.

157
00:07:49,953 --> 00:07:51,761
Scott: I don't know if it's all original every time.

158
00:07:51,781 --> 00:07:56,020
Rym: He said it is all or almost all original content for the dubs of the time.

159
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:56,402
Rym: Forgot.

160
00:07:56,663 --> 00:07:56,904
Scott: All right.

161
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,315
Rym: Not for, you know, I know he's played the same video.

162
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:02,548
Rym: I've seen Ivan, all right, at least more than once.

163
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:02,930
Rym: Okay.

164
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,093
Rym: But I digress.

165
00:08:04,294 --> 00:08:11,647
Rym: So offhandedly I showed some Sailor Moon openers and I said something like, now the new Sailor Moon is probably going to have a different opener.

166
00:08:11,707 --> 00:08:12,772
Rym: And the audience was like, what?

167
00:08:14,137 --> 00:08:15,642
Rym: What do you mean new Sailor Moon?

168
00:08:16,084 --> 00:08:17,770
Scott: And the whole thing, not read the internet.

169
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:18,151
Rym: Yes.

170
00:08:18,211 --> 00:08:20,824
Rym: I was like, all right, how many of you are anime fans?

171
00:08:20,984 --> 00:08:22,592
Rym: And most of the room raised their hands.

172
00:08:22,632 --> 00:08:24,963
Rym: I was like, how many of you read the anime news network?

173
00:08:25,345 --> 00:08:26,611
Rym: Like one person raised their hand.

174
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:27,014
Rym: Well, no, no.

175
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,261
Rym: A bunch of them raised their hands.

176
00:08:28,522 --> 00:08:33,889
Rym: And I was like, for anything other than just reading anime news, Nina, and like one person still had their hand up.

177
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,856
Scott: They just read anime news Nina and that's it?

178
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,582
Scott: Yeah.

179
00:08:37,662 --> 00:08:38,344
Scott: Sounds like me.

180
00:08:38,364 --> 00:08:42,919
Rym: I was like, guys, they actually have all the anime news there is.

181
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:46,632
Scott: So you should probably read it once a week or so.

182
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:47,194
Scott: Yeah.

183
00:08:47,495 --> 00:08:47,856
Rym: So yeah.

184
00:08:47,896 --> 00:08:48,638
Rym: New Sailor Moon.

185
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:54,759
Rym: So that's my news there right around the 20 year anniversary of the Sailor Moon manga.

186
00:08:55,501 --> 00:09:00,680
Rym: There was announced that there is going to be a Sailor Moon anime series.

187
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:02,327
Scott: It's not giving me that scary live action thing.

188
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:02,789
Rym: Nope.

189
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:03,753
Rym: It is not film.

190
00:09:03,914 --> 00:09:05,118
Rym: It is definitely animated.

191
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,738
Rym: You can tell how animated news network when this news broke was like, oh shit.

192
00:09:10,778 --> 00:09:16,621
Rym: Because there is the news, which is two paragraphs update, update two, update three, update four, update five.

193
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:18,590
Scott: The anime news network always does that.

194
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,362
Scott: Their style is to update things like crazy.

195
00:09:21,442 --> 00:09:21,623
Scott: Yeah.

196
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,386
Rym: Cause they had to jump on.

197
00:09:22,427 --> 00:09:39,753
Rym: this new Sailor Moon is a big deal because as Mike tool pointed out, which is the only reason I was thinking of him right now, there are probably more sales of bootleg Sailor Moon DVDs than any other anime in the U S could be because Sailor Moon is ridiculously popular and has a huge nostalgia fan

198
00:09:39,793 --> 00:09:40,033
Scott: base.

199
00:09:40,555 --> 00:09:42,360
Rym: And it's a great show for young kids.

200
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:47,075
Rym: And it was on TV in America after school.

201
00:09:47,115 --> 00:09:51,013
Scott: Well, it's one of those things where it was on TV in America after school syndicated.

202
00:09:51,053 --> 00:09:54,770
Scott: So it's just as popular as Voltron, GI Joe, et cetera, perhaps even more popular.

203
00:09:55,252 --> 00:09:59,210
Scott: And those things are all worthwhile apparently financially to bring back transformers even.

204
00:09:59,370 --> 00:09:59,531
Scott: Right.

205
00:09:59,972 --> 00:10:03,284
Scott: But this one, because it was an anime, right.

206
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:13,887
Scott: Where as opposed to sort of a half anime like transformers, a Thundercats or any of the other things, um, because it was anime after it was on TV and then marketed and then it disappeared.

207
00:10:14,068 --> 00:10:17,038
Scott: And I think they're currently publishing manga of it in the US.

208
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:21,091
Scott: And I think that also some company has t-shirts with this.

209
00:10:21,131 --> 00:10:22,276
Scott: We love fine of the t-shirts.

210
00:10:23,341 --> 00:10:23,823
Scott: I don't know.

211
00:10:23,863 --> 00:10:36,760
Scott: Someone has the merchandise license and makes a few t-shirts, but that's pretty much the extent of Sailor Moon being used for money making purposes legally in the United States, despite the fact that it is at the present time recording of this podcast.

212
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:45,270
Scott: and compare that to say Voltron and Voltron is way more being used by all kinds, DVDs, books, comics, you know, it's all very interesting.

213
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:51,508
Scott: Sailor Moon is a very underutilized, underexploited license in the United States of America.

214
00:10:51,528 --> 00:11:04,677
Rym: Basically just highlights the absolute dysfunction of the anime industry here that this Sailor Moon is pretty much if I was if I was going to bet on the most guaranteed anime moneymaker there is, I think it's that.

215
00:11:04,918 --> 00:11:05,119
Rym: Yeah.

216
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:06,785
Rym: It like guaranteed money.

217
00:11:06,885 --> 00:11:08,973
Rym: And yet somehow the show is awful.

218
00:11:09,354 --> 00:11:09,515
Rym: No, no.

219
00:11:09,575 --> 00:11:11,201
Rym: The original the old Sailor Moon.

220
00:11:11,222 --> 00:11:12,306
Scott: Yeah.

221
00:11:12,346 --> 00:11:15,801
Rym: Just taking that old license, just selling DVDs, putting it back on TV, selling.

222
00:11:15,881 --> 00:11:18,674
Rym: I think I would make a load of money, but I digress.

223
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:20,421
Scott: Well, relative to anime.

224
00:11:20,742 --> 00:11:26,263
Rym: So there's new Sailor Moon and it appears that it is going to be a redo, like a retelling.

225
00:11:26,304 --> 00:11:27,347
Rym: It's going to follow the manga.

226
00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:40,681
Rym: There were rumors that it's going to follow the manga more closely in style, which would be really interesting because if you think the show is trippy, especially like Sailor Stars to the end, you've never seen the Sailor Moon manga.

227
00:11:40,782 --> 00:11:41,726
Rym: It is good.

228
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:44,338
Scott: Maybe it'll be like the Hakama Kitarou Sailor Moon.

229
00:11:44,358 --> 00:11:44,962
Scott: I would watch that.

230
00:11:44,982 --> 00:11:46,510
Rym: I would watch the shit out of that.

231
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,303
Rym: Yeah, because Sailor Moon is not what you think it is.

232
00:11:49,363 --> 00:11:53,314
Rym: If you it's all it's basically Green Lantern space bullshit.

233
00:11:54,518 --> 00:11:58,247
Rym: But anime Sailor Moon magical girls style it.

234
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:00,734
Rym: That is what Sailor Moon is at its core.

235
00:12:00,774 --> 00:12:01,537
Rym: Also lesbians.

236
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,403
Rym: Lots of lesbians.

237
00:12:03,503 --> 00:12:03,704
Rym: Yeah.

238
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:07,197
Rym: But we don't know many more details than this.

239
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,024
Rym: And the rumor about that.

240
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:10,370
Scott: What's in those five updates?

241
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,213
Scott: Any details?

242
00:12:11,535 --> 00:12:18,102
Rym: Oh, so you want to, here's all the details we know as of when we recorded the show reading from the anime news and idol group more.

243
00:12:18,222 --> 00:12:25,204
Rym: Moro Clover Z. Never heard of him is singing the new song and they covered moonlight.

244
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:31,560
Rym: It might be a new song, but they covered moonlight Densetsu from France where they were guests of Japan expo.

245
00:12:34,466 --> 00:12:34,847
Rym: Yeah.

246
00:12:35,108 --> 00:12:35,569
Rym: You know what?

247
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,256
Rym: And we over just around the world.

248
00:12:37,317 --> 00:12:39,087
Rym: I think I know why people keep coming back to it.

249
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:42,762
Rym: People were growing crazy for German Sailor Moon.

250
00:12:42,782 --> 00:12:45,076
Scott: They don't know how to use YouTube to listen to it whenever they want.

251
00:12:45,116 --> 00:12:45,237
Scott: No.

252
00:12:45,258 --> 00:12:48,918
Rym: At the end of the panel I was like, guys, you can just go to YouTube and find all this stuff and more.

253
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:50,484
Rym: I could do this panel for four hours.

254
00:12:50,505 --> 00:13:04,013
Rym: So anyway, update two, uh, the original voice actors of, uh, Usagi and, uh, Mamoru were at this event, but no one knows if they're actually going to be the voice actors for the new show or not.

255
00:13:04,153 --> 00:13:05,602
Scott: I'm sure someone can sound just like them.

256
00:13:06,024 --> 00:13:06,306
Rym: Probably.

257
00:13:06,326 --> 00:13:07,532
Scott: This has never really been a problem.

258
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:11,466
Rym: Uh, konacha editor Osano confirmed that it's an anime.

259
00:13:11,486 --> 00:13:12,509
Rym: I like how that was.

260
00:13:12,569 --> 00:13:13,111
Rym: update two.

261
00:13:13,131 --> 00:13:14,436
Rym: Okay.

262
00:13:14,456 --> 00:13:15,379
Rym: I update three.

263
00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:24,990
Rym: He also emphasized that no details have been set for when it hypothetically will be broadcast, but it will be released to the world simultaneously.

264
00:13:25,731 --> 00:13:25,891
Scott: Hooray.

265
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,174
Scott: Smart person.

266
00:13:27,194 --> 00:13:27,915
Rym: Yeah.

267
00:13:28,236 --> 00:13:29,158
Scott: A winner is you.

268
00:13:29,178 --> 00:13:44,511
Rym: Uh, so one of the voice actors, the one, the girl who played the Usagi originally mused publicly if she will be in the anime or not and her blog, she said she'd be eager to play a role in it and there was no other update there.

269
00:13:45,475 --> 00:13:50,878
Rym: And the final update, she said in her blog that the enemy is not the dark kingdom and people lost their shit about that.

270
00:13:51,320 --> 00:14:03,679
Rym: But then there was a clarification that she was speaking metaphorically and that her, the figurative enemy of her would be her when she originally played sailor moon.

271
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:07,553
Rym: because quote, that was an audacious performance compared to her acting now.

272
00:14:08,897 --> 00:14:10,462
Rym: That is all we know.

273
00:14:10,964 --> 00:14:20,052
Rym: But the fact that there is a new sailor moon, if anything could be used to catapult anime fandom back to, I don't think it'll make anime fandom.

274
00:14:20,113 --> 00:14:21,400
Scott: It'll just make sailor moon fan.

275
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:21,923
Rym: All right, fine.

276
00:14:22,003 --> 00:14:23,531
Rym: I'll, I'll, I'll qualify this further.

277
00:14:23,932 --> 00:14:32,421
Rym: If anything could be used to take anime and use it to make money in the us from a mainstream market, it is this right now.

278
00:14:32,502 --> 00:14:43,564
Rym: This is like a big chance for that industry to ignore the history of terribly licensed, terribly managed companies and properties and just make money, which is what companies are designed.

279
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:55,879
Scott: I think I just sort of, you know, realize just now it's like, you know, we're looking at anime like anime fandom, but it's really, no, it's people are, you know, you could be a Voltron fan, but no one says, oh, you're an American cartoon fan.

280
00:14:55,939 --> 00:14:56,421
Scott: It's like what?

281
00:14:56,903 --> 00:14:57,345
Rym: Exactly.

282
00:14:57,385 --> 00:15:00,457
Scott: And that it's like people are just fans of individual properties.

283
00:15:00,477 --> 00:15:04,916
Scott: They're not really fans of a whole, you know, category of media or whatever.

284
00:15:04,956 --> 00:15:05,559
Rym: Exactly.

285
00:15:05,599 --> 00:15:07,368
Scott: Some people are, but some people are not.

286
00:15:07,488 --> 00:15:08,031
Scott: This is what's killing.

287
00:15:08,111 --> 00:15:36,366
Rym: anime cons, not to name any names, but many people I know who work on the panels departments for anime cons have said they're getting fewer and fewer submissions for anime related content and less and less interest in anime content, even though the cons are all growing crazily in attendance, because it'd be like, if you had a sci-fi TV convention, all the doctor who fans show up and all the Sherlock fans show up and all the firefly fans show up, but they're not all self-identified sci-fi TV fans.

288
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:36,847
Scott: Yeah.

289
00:15:36,867 --> 00:15:38,253
Scott: There's plenty of sci-fi TV.

290
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,399
Scott: They don't give a shit about it.

291
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,113
Scott: And if you have, you need doctor who panels to get them to go.

292
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:48,947
Rym: I mean, look, Connecticut last year, we had almost almost, I think we actually had fewer than half the anime rated related submissions.

293
00:15:48,987 --> 00:15:49,951
Rym: this year is the previous year.

294
00:15:50,653 --> 00:15:56,068
Rym: Anime fandom as a discreet fandom is basically collapsing anyway.

295
00:15:56,229 --> 00:16:07,218
Rym: Anyway, that's all asides because it's time for things of the day.

296
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:10,105
Rym: So your fans got, this is kind of up your alley.

297
00:16:10,286 --> 00:16:11,252
Rym: You haven't actually watched it yet.

298
00:16:11,273 --> 00:16:18,321
Rym: We showed you the beginning, but a Terry Jones, you know, and you're a fan of, uh, medieval guys and tapestries and things like that.

299
00:16:18,963 --> 00:16:28,969
Rym: So Terry Jones has a show on the BBC called medieval lives, and it's a pretty well researched and, uh, believable.

300
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,095
Rym: I'm credulous toward its information.

301
00:16:31,576 --> 00:16:36,473
Rym: Look at what different sorts of lifestyles were actually like in the middle ages.

302
00:16:37,115 --> 00:16:39,183
Rym: It's delightful and all of it's on youtube.

303
00:16:39,626 --> 00:16:40,008
Scott: Oh yeah.

304
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,596
Scott: I have to watch this at some point.

305
00:16:41,636 --> 00:16:42,319
Rym: It's pretty great.

306
00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:43,343
Rym: I've watched every episode.

307
00:16:44,206 --> 00:16:48,681
Scott: So here's a video on youtube that is almost over 5 million views, right?

308
00:16:49,264 --> 00:16:51,491
Scott: We all know that snakes are not good.

309
00:16:51,531 --> 00:16:53,579
Scott: You don't want to get bit by a snake.

310
00:16:53,659 --> 00:16:56,388
Rym: Don't you dare say anything bad about that?

311
00:16:56,429 --> 00:16:57,011
Rym: hot Lamia.

312
00:16:57,031 --> 00:16:59,680
Scott: You don't want to get bit by a poison snake.

313
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,602
Rym: No, you don't know.

314
00:17:00,703 --> 00:17:02,849
Rym: So, uh, right.

315
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,739
Scott: But you know, snake venom, how does it work?

316
00:17:05,999 --> 00:17:07,928
Scott: Like magnets, like magnets.

317
00:17:07,968 --> 00:17:10,117
Rym: Now there are different kinds of snakes, venoms, of course.

318
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:16,145
Scott: So what they do in this video to illustrate the danger of snake venom and how crazy, you know, you don't want to get bit by it.

319
00:17:16,768 --> 00:17:17,612
Scott: They take a snake.

320
00:17:17,653 --> 00:17:23,339
Scott: that's way dangerous and they get some venom out of it, like a few drops, like less than like a milliliter in a tiny in a syringe.

321
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:23,801
Scott: Right.

322
00:17:24,303 --> 00:17:27,474
Scott: Then they get like a little cup full of blood from a person.

323
00:17:27,896 --> 00:17:28,117
Scott: Right.

324
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:28,780
Scott: Not too much.

325
00:17:29,621 --> 00:17:33,815
Scott: And they put one drop of the snake venom into the cup of blood and swoosh it around.

326
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:36,747
Scott: And it's like, whoa, whoa.

327
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,460
Scott: That is why you do not want the snake venom in your blood.

328
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,470
Scott: You will be dead in like two seconds.

329
00:17:41,771 --> 00:17:44,203
Scott: You got to see what happens to this blood when the snake venom gets in it.

330
00:17:44,284 --> 00:17:49,605
Rym: So that is, I believe, an opisthologic glyphus color Britic poison.

331
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,069
Scott: All right.

332
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:53,335
Rym: As opposed to a protero glyphus snake.

333
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:57,430
Rym: So I went to Wikipedia to figure out which kind of snake venom that was.

334
00:17:57,892 --> 00:17:59,298
Rym: And I know I read the wrong ones.

335
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:02,047
Rym: Actually, it is the protero glyphus.

336
00:18:02,307 --> 00:18:03,932
Rym: No, it's viper venom.

337
00:18:04,152 --> 00:18:04,995
Rym: That was a viper.

338
00:18:05,015 --> 00:18:07,121
Rym: It says, blah, blah, blah.

339
00:18:07,201 --> 00:18:10,916
Rym: Bringing about coagulation of the blood and clotting of the pulmonary arteries.

340
00:18:10,936 --> 00:18:12,623
Rym: Mm hmm.

341
00:18:12,643 --> 00:18:12,824
Rym: All right.

342
00:18:12,965 --> 00:18:14,009
Rym: Any herpetologists out there?

343
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:17,204
Rym: I'm sorry for the manner in which I said the words I just said.

344
00:18:17,224 --> 00:18:19,052
Rym: I apologize to you.

345
00:18:19,072 --> 00:18:20,739
Scott: Are you sure it's not a glyphus?

346
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,663
Rym: Uh, well, okay.

347
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:26,988
Rym: I'm going to read to you what happens if it watch this video and you could watch it while you're listening to the following.

348
00:18:27,008 --> 00:18:28,114
Rym: This is a quote from Wikipedia.

349
00:18:28,838 --> 00:18:31,391
Rym: The bite is immediately followed by local pain of a burning character.

350
00:18:31,692 --> 00:18:40,072
Rym: The limb soon swells and becomes discolored and within one to three hours, great prostration accompanied by vomiting and often diarrhea sets in cold, clammy perspiration.

351
00:18:40,112 --> 00:18:41,980
Rym: As usual, the pulse becomes extremely feeble.

352
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,676
Rym: A slight this Nania and restlessness may be seen in severe cases.

353
00:18:48,117 --> 00:18:49,803
Rym: The pulse may become imperceptible.

354
00:18:50,024 --> 00:18:51,470
Scott: I'm going to have just listen to this.

355
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:53,540
Rym: Uh, I'm going to read one sentence.

356
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,824
Rym: The sentence horrifies me.

357
00:18:55,246 --> 00:18:58,478
Rym: The limb becomes flag, menace and occasionally separates.

358
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:01,793
Scott: I'm good because that words don't mean anything to me.

359
00:19:02,456 --> 00:19:04,183
Scott: That didn't bother me because I don't know what the words mean.

360
00:19:04,906 --> 00:19:06,473
Scott: I'm glad I'm not going to become flag.

361
00:19:06,493 --> 00:19:08,020
Rym: Menace leads to death.

362
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,523
Scott: Yeah, duh.

363
00:19:10,225 --> 00:19:12,110
Scott: G. How about this poison?

364
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,975
Scott: Oh, it's nonlethal poison.

365
00:19:14,477 --> 00:19:15,500
Scott: There's not poison, is it?

366
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,673
Rym: All right, so nonlethal bullets, meta moments.

367
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:22,825
Rym: The book club book was one Q eight four by Herkey Murakami.

368
00:19:22,906 --> 00:19:23,772
Rym: We read it a while ago.

369
00:19:23,792 --> 00:19:24,778
Rym: We just haven't done the show yet.

370
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:27,773
Rym: We'll try to do the show soon before I forget what the book was about.

371
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:29,180
Scott: I should have taken notes.

372
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:29,962
Scott: I don't know.

373
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:30,666
Scott: I didn't take notes.

374
00:19:30,686 --> 00:19:30,847
Scott: I did.

375
00:19:30,887 --> 00:19:31,631
Scott: I should have taken notes.

376
00:19:31,651 --> 00:19:38,021
Rym: I started taking notes halfway through and I have three notes, one of which is little people with a question mark.

377
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,247
Rym: And then later I circled that.

378
00:19:39,488 --> 00:19:42,985
Scott: I'm taking notes from now on for all future book clubs to improve the episode.

379
00:19:43,005 --> 00:19:45,919
Rym: The next book club book will be the man who was Thursday.

380
00:19:45,939 --> 00:19:47,687
Scott: How could you be Thursday?

381
00:19:47,747 --> 00:19:48,652
Scott: It's a day of the week.

382
00:19:48,692 --> 00:19:50,400
Rym: That's like, maybe you should read the book.

383
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,607
Scott: The man who was car.

384
00:19:52,647 --> 00:19:54,212
Rym: Have you met my good man Friday?

385
00:19:54,232 --> 00:19:57,463
Scott: Yeah, that's cause the guy's name is Friday.

386
00:19:57,483 --> 00:19:58,992
Rym: How do you know this guy's name isn't Thursday?

387
00:19:59,313 --> 00:20:00,259
Rym: The man who was Rym.

388
00:20:00,379 --> 00:20:04,415
Scott: Well, if he was Thursday though, that means he's no longer Thursday.

389
00:20:04,455 --> 00:20:05,600
Scott: Maybe he changed his name.

390
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:09,955
Rym: Well if he was Thursday, then the question is, has he been since Thursday?

391
00:20:11,139 --> 00:20:12,864
Rym: I don't think anyone's going to get that reference.

392
00:20:12,985 --> 00:20:13,326
Scott: Anyway.

393
00:20:13,386 --> 00:20:14,108
Rym: Has he been?

394
00:20:15,212 --> 00:20:16,074
Rym: After breakfast.

395
00:20:16,095 --> 00:20:17,278
Rym: All right.

396
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:20,448
Rym: So we will be at the penny arcade expo.

397
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,975
Rym: We actually, I can announce our panel.

398
00:20:23,036 --> 00:20:25,645
Rym: It is called short subjects in gaming.

399
00:20:25,685 --> 00:20:26,649
Rym: Remember that triple threat?

400
00:20:27,011 --> 00:20:29,120
Rym: It's that again, but with three new topics.

401
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,424
Scott: Yeah, it's too bad.

402
00:20:30,485 --> 00:20:31,874
Scott: We need to come up with a way to title it.

403
00:20:31,914 --> 00:20:33,202
Scott: That'll get better attendance next year.

404
00:20:33,222 --> 00:20:34,487
Rym: I should see last year.

405
00:20:34,528 --> 00:20:37,059
Rym: It almost filled the room and was PAX East, right?

406
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,365
Rym: Uh, two years ago at PAX East.

407
00:20:38,385 --> 00:20:42,303
Rym: That, that was a very popular panel and I think the difference is this year.

408
00:20:42,323 --> 00:20:51,766
Rym: Uh, what I noticed was that we always write very succinct descriptions because most conventions don't only give you a little bit of space in the program book, like 80 words, 90 words.

409
00:20:52,508 --> 00:20:56,983
Rym: So last year I find like, I usually don't really read the packs program guide.

410
00:20:57,003 --> 00:21:04,369
Rym: So I was like reading it and I realized everyone else who speaks at packs writes like a quarter page description.

411
00:21:05,372 --> 00:21:09,964
Rym: So I emailed them and I was like, so can I just, is, is there a limit?

412
00:21:09,985 --> 00:21:11,048
Rym: And they were like, not really.

413
00:21:11,851 --> 00:21:18,264
Rym: So I wrote a gigantic description of showing all the different parts of this panel and what we're going to talk about and we'll see what that does.

414
00:21:18,646 --> 00:21:21,240
Scott: But we were doing, I not too many people look at the description.

415
00:21:21,761 --> 00:21:23,346
Rym: I named these sub panels.

416
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,835
Rym: So we're doing a competitive test of skill.

417
00:21:27,678 --> 00:21:28,280
Rym: That's one of them.

418
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:32,957
Rym: When the game plays the player, uh, that's about rhythm games.

419
00:21:33,078 --> 00:21:34,282
Rym: I think that's a good way to call that.

420
00:21:34,784 --> 00:21:36,672
Rym: And on the ethics of mind control.

421
00:21:37,073 --> 00:21:42,376
Rym: Uh, well, we'll, we'll talk about more as that's coming up, but it is on Friday in the Wolfman theater in the afternoon.

422
00:21:42,396 --> 00:21:48,823
Rym: We are also, we can announce now going to be at PAX dev for the first time ever, even though we are not devs.

423
00:21:49,465 --> 00:21:58,792
Rym: Well, uh, I have half written a shitty game in unity where a cube scrolls back and forth sideways shooting cubes at another cube.

424
00:21:58,933 --> 00:22:02,286
Scott: I wrote hang man in C for the Apple LC two.

425
00:22:02,607 --> 00:22:06,082
Rym: Oh, and remember that I bet that ad you had about a Puerto Rico style war game.

426
00:22:06,143 --> 00:22:06,805
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

427
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:07,810
Rym: I designed it on the way home.

428
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:08,653
Rym: I have this really good idea.

429
00:22:08,674 --> 00:22:11,668
Rym: I it was in my pocket, but it got wet.

430
00:22:11,709 --> 00:22:14,161
Scott: I'm pretty sure the game's already been done in some fashion.

431
00:22:14,181 --> 00:22:15,968
Scott: I mean, eclipse is sort of it.

432
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:20,143
Rym: No, you'll see what I, anyway, I digress, but uh, we're going to be there.

433
00:22:20,204 --> 00:22:25,624
Rym: We've got a Lou Crane on our panel, Jared Sorenson, uh, Alex Avery of PopCap games.

434
00:22:26,768 --> 00:22:41,520
Rym: Uh, we've got a couple other people that I shouldn't announce yet because they may or may not actually be able to be on the panel, depending entirely on whether or not they either get permission to be on the panel or are going to be in Seattle.

435
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:48,287
Rym: bail now, because they didn't, they never, whoa, they didn't actually bail because they didn't a hundred percent confirm yet.

436
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:51,964
Rym: So it was, it was possible they would bail and I knew they was possible.

437
00:22:51,984 --> 00:22:57,748
Rym: So it's not actually a bail, but anyway, it is academia versus reality, psychology, game theory and games.

438
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:02,666
Rym: So we talk a big shit game about, you know, how games should be designed.

439
00:23:02,686 --> 00:23:15,355
Rym: Like here's the game theory, Colonel Blotto game, all this analysis, psychology, and we're going to talk to game designers and see how much of that academia is actually used in games and game design.

440
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:15,936
Scott: Almost none.

441
00:23:15,957 --> 00:23:15,997
Scott: Dr.

442
00:23:16,017 --> 00:23:18,728
Rym: Hazard might be the only person who actually uses it.

443
00:23:18,769 --> 00:23:19,110
Scott: Maybe.

444
00:23:20,035 --> 00:23:24,613
Rym: And I think it's going to be an interesting discussion commercially for, you know, consumer video games and such.

445
00:23:24,994 --> 00:23:28,229
Rym: Uh, anyway, uh, otherwise we'll be in MAGFest doing our thing.

446
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:30,942
Rym: and that's as far out as I want to project other meta moments.

447
00:23:31,023 --> 00:23:34,619
Scott: You should go to our website for a crew.com because that's our website.

448
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:39,912
Scott: You should go to the website of things that if you're, I mean, if you're listening to the podcast, how could you not go to the website of the podcast?

449
00:23:40,455 --> 00:23:43,827
Scott: Also, if you're an old fuddy duddy, we have an email newsletter.

450
00:23:43,948 --> 00:23:44,951
Scott: It's kind of crazy.

451
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:47,400
Scott: I actually sent it out on time.

452
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,251
Scott: The second, you know, that's the second one I've sent.

453
00:23:50,573 --> 00:23:54,410
Scott: I'll probably send them, continue to send them cause it's on my calendar and have a reminder for it.

454
00:23:54,973 --> 00:23:59,574
Scott: So if you go to the website, there's a little email subscriber link somewhere.

455
00:23:59,594 --> 00:24:01,544
Scott: I think it might be in the footer somewhere.

456
00:24:01,805 --> 00:24:04,176
Scott: Um, you can subscribe to this email newsletter.

457
00:24:04,196 --> 00:24:07,210
Scott: If you think it's stupid, you can unsubscribe and it'll actually unsubscribe.

458
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:11,691
Scott: You see, we're not going to spam you and it will remind you occasionally of the things are up to.

459
00:24:11,711 --> 00:24:11,791
Rym: Yeah.

460
00:24:12,495 --> 00:24:19,459
Scott: It's uh, if you don't like to be reminded by email, you can also be reminded by Twitter, Facebook, Google plus.

461
00:24:19,539 --> 00:24:32,415
Rym: I will tell you though, if you don't subscribe to Scott's, there's, you know, the information in the newsletter we talk about in the meta moment, everything, but there is also a newsletter thing of the day that is not ever going to be on regular GeekNights.

462
00:24:32,736 --> 00:24:34,785
Rym: We, uh, you will be missing content.

463
00:24:34,845 --> 00:24:40,867
Scott: If you do not subscribe, there is a small amount of exclusive content in the newsletter part.

464
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:41,469
Scott: Yes.

465
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,393
Rym: Very important.

466
00:24:42,633 --> 00:24:45,243
Scott: You could real also just, I mean, it's an email guys.

467
00:24:45,263 --> 00:24:45,585
Scott: Come on.

468
00:24:45,926 --> 00:24:50,204
Rym: Also, you know, we have a video section, so go to our youtube channel, spread our videos around.

469
00:24:50,585 --> 00:25:03,851
Rym: If any one of our packs lectures gets up to 10,000 views before packs, I will find out based on the refers who caused that to be, and I will buy you one or more beverages at packs that may or may not be alcoholic.

470
00:25:05,277 --> 00:25:06,120
Rym: Notice how I'm giving.

471
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:12,625
Rym: very difficult to acquire from me, but easy to provide if someone does actually put forth the effort of acquiring them.

472
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:13,067
Rym: prizes.

473
00:25:13,087 --> 00:25:17,047
Rym: I've learned my lesson from the contest of yield and days met a moment.

474
00:25:17,067 --> 00:25:19,116
Scott: We did things of the day we did.

475
00:25:19,136 --> 00:25:19,860
Scott: All right, let's do the show.

476
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:20,482
Scott: All right.

477
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:24,474
Rym: So this is a very special, very important review.

478
00:25:24,534 --> 00:25:26,942
Scott: You see several years in the making.

479
00:25:27,002 --> 00:25:38,422
Rym: Several years ago, our good friend Timo who lives very far away and as a particle physicist who had one point one very important time at packs, he came to packs to hang out with prime.

480
00:25:38,623 --> 00:25:39,586
Rym: Yes, it was awesome.

481
00:25:40,128 --> 00:25:41,171
Scott: But you also get in the Mogo.

482
00:25:41,251 --> 00:25:49,246
Rym: one year whenever a physicist is at a bar with you having dinner and he says, here, let me show you something about physics and he pulls off his belt.

483
00:25:49,286 --> 00:25:51,456
Rym: You know, you're in for a wild ride.

484
00:25:51,476 --> 00:25:59,229
Rym: Yeah, I have pulled that belt trick and so many people, even though I barely understand it, I'm taking his belt off and on bars around the world anyway.

485
00:25:59,711 --> 00:26:05,976
Rym: So Timo, you know, he sent us a care package, a box of a number of comics from his native land that he would like.

486
00:26:06,016 --> 00:26:07,342
Scott: So long ago we still lived in beacon.

487
00:26:07,383 --> 00:26:11,802
Scott: So I guess it had to be oh eight or nine or earlier that, you know, to read.

488
00:26:11,902 --> 00:26:16,123
Rym: and some of them he let us keep, but some of them are rare or you know, they're dear to him.

489
00:26:16,143 --> 00:26:17,229
Rym: and he wanted us to send them back.

490
00:26:17,772 --> 00:26:21,427
Rym: And we said, yes, we will review them, read them all, enjoy them and send them back.

491
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:22,793
Rym: We're assholes.

492
00:26:23,436 --> 00:26:26,046
Rym: And I've still got the, I'm sitting here with the books right now.

493
00:26:26,066 --> 00:26:28,575
Rym: We finally read them.

494
00:26:28,595 --> 00:26:31,745
Scott: We didn't lose them or ruin them or forget them.

495
00:26:31,886 --> 00:26:42,558
Rym: But in return, the care package, when we send them back, I am sending him two of the rarest and most dear, hard to get comic series that we have.

496
00:26:42,578 --> 00:26:45,572
Rym: And he can basically hold them hostage as long as he would like.

497
00:26:46,196 --> 00:26:46,900
Scott: What are you sending him?

498
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,767
Rym: I think I want to send him sanctuary and Eagle.

499
00:26:48,808 --> 00:26:55,175
Rym: I think he has scans of sanctuary, but it's something else to read the actual original like printing of it.

500
00:26:55,537 --> 00:26:57,044
Scott: Make sure he wants them before you send them.

501
00:26:57,144 --> 00:27:00,944
Rym: Yeah, well, we'll follow up on that, but we've, we're, we've read many of these comics.

502
00:27:00,984 --> 00:27:07,289
Rym: I think we reviewed one of them because it was short a long time ago, but we read the in call all the way through.

503
00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:08,833
Rym: We're here to review this.

504
00:27:09,976 --> 00:27:12,121
Rym: So Timo, this is for you.

505
00:27:13,725 --> 00:27:19,838
Scott: I know that the in call, I, I've heard of this and I knew it was a famous thing.

506
00:27:19,858 --> 00:27:25,219
Scott: And also I know who Mobius is extra famous and had does the awesomest arts of all time.

507
00:27:25,239 --> 00:27:27,289
Scott: And he also passed away recently, which is sad.

508
00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:29,138
Scott: I don't know who the writer is.

509
00:27:29,158 --> 00:27:29,902
Scott: I never heard of him before.

510
00:27:30,062 --> 00:27:31,147
Scott: Alejandro Jodorowsky.

511
00:27:31,248 --> 00:27:33,981
Rym: I'd heard of the Jodover's, but I didn't know what that was.

512
00:27:34,001 --> 00:27:34,867
Scott: I'd never heard of that either.

513
00:27:34,887 --> 00:27:37,201
Rym: Kind of like how way back in the day I'd heard a bone.

514
00:27:37,703 --> 00:27:39,951
Rym: Like I'd be like, Oh, there's that bone.

515
00:27:40,011 --> 00:27:42,098
Rym: But I didn't know what it was like.

516
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:42,540
Rym: I didn't know.

517
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:46,252
Rym: it was just a fancy adventure with a guy who was from Bonville.

518
00:27:46,734 --> 00:27:49,566
Scott: But anyway, uh, but I knew there was a comic called the in call.

519
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:50,652
Scott: I didn't know anything else about it.

520
00:27:51,255 --> 00:27:53,527
Scott: I just read it and there are two volumes and that's the whole thing.

521
00:27:53,648 --> 00:28:02,717
Rym: So in the fashion of old comics, we had two trades here and there is absolutely no indication which one to read first.

522
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:03,178
Scott: Yeah.

523
00:28:03,478 --> 00:28:09,138
Rym: And if you start reading either one from page one, it is not any clearer which one to read first.

524
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:12,792
Scott: You have to read the back to where it says like epic conclusion or whatever.

525
00:28:12,812 --> 00:28:12,892
Scott: Yeah.

526
00:28:13,173 --> 00:28:13,554
Scott: Yeah.

527
00:28:13,575 --> 00:28:16,547
Rym: You have to read the text on the back to figure it out.

528
00:28:16,748 --> 00:28:18,155
Scott: But yeah, that's an annoying thing.

529
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:26,152
Scott: Just the way they publish comics in the U S until the manga boom sort of where they sort of realized you're supposed to put volume numbers on things and people know what order to read stuff.

530
00:28:26,253 --> 00:28:28,644
Scott: Now even the ages sort of made trades.

531
00:28:28,684 --> 00:28:29,648
Scott: They didn't really give a shit.

532
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:32,320
Rym: Even dark horse of guilty is guilty of this bullshit.

533
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:36,756
Rym: The, uh, the, uh, well, oh my God is, oh my God is back in the day.

534
00:28:36,796 --> 00:28:37,900
Rym: There were no numbers on it.

535
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,276
Rym: You had no idea which one was the most recent one, which one to read.

536
00:28:41,296 --> 00:28:42,562
Scott: That's still going by the way.

537
00:28:42,622 --> 00:28:43,064
Rym: Yeah, I know.

538
00:28:43,084 --> 00:28:45,777
Rym: But there's numbers on it now as far as I remember.

539
00:28:45,818 --> 00:28:45,978
Rym: Yeah.

540
00:28:45,999 --> 00:28:48,047
Scott: I think there, there's a newer edition of it.

541
00:28:48,147 --> 00:28:51,843
Rym: that is, I really liked that comic, but it eventually went nowhere and I couldn't read it anymore.

542
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:54,111
Scott: It's still going even in Japan.

543
00:28:54,192 --> 00:28:55,517
Scott: So it's still going nowhere.

544
00:28:55,537 --> 00:28:55,577
Scott: So

545
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:20,637
Rym: anyway, the in Kyle gets a lot of points for the fact that it starts and ends effectively in media res, but in a way that feels like you're starting with like issue 108 of the uncanny X men and you just, you should know who all these people are, but yet, no, it's the beginning.

546
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:21,300
Rym: Yeah.

547
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:40,543
Scott: It's sort of the, you know, it does that thing that we always say we like a lot of things to do where there's a universe and there's a lot of things in that universe, but they, they're just sort of there and carrot people, you know, it's not like where people will, you know, explicitly go out of their way to explain something because in the meta, the author knows that you don't know what that is.

548
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:46,790
Scott: It's more like Prince of nothing where people just start using proper nouns and they don't explain them and there's no glossary.

549
00:29:47,151 --> 00:29:51,993
Scott: So you have to sort of figure out in context what all those proper nouns mean and what those things are.

550
00:29:52,013 --> 00:29:52,737
Scott: And it's like, oh, okay.

551
00:29:52,778 --> 00:30:00,992
Scott: The police are robots in this world without any character having to say, yes, in this world, you know, the police are all robotic things and they work this way.

552
00:30:01,012 --> 00:30:03,022
Scott: It's just, you just see them and that's how it, you just accept it.

553
00:30:03,262 --> 00:30:10,386
Rym: But the, the difference is that this really makes you feel like you should know like the Prince of nothing.

554
00:30:10,426 --> 00:30:11,974
Rym: Like, I don't know what I'm trying to figure it out.

555
00:30:12,014 --> 00:30:25,528
Rym: This, I feel like, ah, how come I don't know who that guy is, but not in a bad way, but more like the book is admonishing me to make me feel confused and disoriented and, and force me to kind of just get past that and just go with it.

556
00:30:26,251 --> 00:30:38,695
Rym: And I kind of liked that because I remember when I was a kid and I read my first X-Men comic Eve ever, I just picked up a random X-Men comic and I started reading it and comics in that era were like the cool kids would read them.

557
00:30:39,317 --> 00:30:40,442
Rym: And I was into other things.

558
00:30:40,482 --> 00:30:41,989
Rym: I was like, oh, I'm going to read these comics.

559
00:30:42,029 --> 00:30:47,132
Rym: And I read, I read some X-Men and I felt like, oh, that, that'd be, I should know who these people are.

560
00:30:47,193 --> 00:30:48,177
Rym: Like I should know.

561
00:30:48,197 --> 00:30:51,130
Rym: It's a failing of me that I do not know who these characters are.

562
00:30:51,732 --> 00:30:55,743
Rym: The end call evoke that same feeling.

563
00:30:55,783 --> 00:30:56,666
Scott: I did not have that feeling.

564
00:30:56,686 --> 00:30:57,951
Rym: Oh, maybe it's just me.

565
00:30:58,313 --> 00:30:58,554
Scott: Yeah.

566
00:30:59,196 --> 00:31:05,261
Scott: I mean, I have had that feeling in the past, but not with this particular book, but I could see how one could have that feeling.

567
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:17,284
Rym: So interestingly, you know, where a lot of people might've heard about these is that the director, the fifth element, there was a lawsuit claiming that elements in the fifth element were borrowed from the income.

568
00:31:17,384 --> 00:31:26,613
Scott: I could see how somebody might think that looking at the two things, how they might have some sort of connection, but no, not really.

569
00:31:26,834 --> 00:31:29,844
Scott: They're pretty far apart, even though they have similarities.

570
00:31:29,925 --> 00:31:35,188
Scott: I don't think there's any enough similarity to, uh, to claim that there's any sort of, uh, wrongdoings.

571
00:31:35,248 --> 00:31:36,473
Scott: What, what happened with the lawsuit?

572
00:31:36,614 --> 00:31:37,156
Rym: Uh, they lost.

573
00:31:37,357 --> 00:31:37,618
Rym: Yeah.

574
00:31:37,658 --> 00:31:38,643
Rym: They lost handling.

575
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:39,908
Scott: So in other words, I'm right.

576
00:31:39,928 --> 00:31:40,451
Scott: Yeah.

577
00:31:40,471 --> 00:31:40,611
Rym: Yeah.

578
00:31:40,631 --> 00:31:40,732
Rym: Yeah.

579
00:31:40,812 --> 00:31:42,861
Scott: I saw Lulu cosplay ConnectiCon this weekend.

580
00:31:42,881 --> 00:31:45,434
Scott: I said multi-pass and she pulled out a multi-pass of course.

581
00:31:45,474 --> 00:31:56,729
Rym: If you're cosplaying as her and you don't have a multi-pass on you, I'm just saying, Oh, uh, random aside, the best cosplay kinetic con was the running man cosplay.

582
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:56,990
Rym: Yes.

583
00:31:57,351 --> 00:31:59,398
Rym: I was so amazed that that was there.

584
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:02,814
Rym: And I think they were equally amazed that we immediately knew what they knew.

585
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:08,177
Rym: We were like, Oh my God, I almost wanted to run over and rip off their name tag, but I was worried.

586
00:32:08,197 --> 00:32:13,415
Rym: It wasn't actually Velcro and I was going to ruin their costume, but no, that was super cool.

587
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,461
Scott: But anyway, back off the tangent.

588
00:32:15,803 --> 00:32:23,168
Rym: One other interesting thing about the in-call is that the, the additions that Timo sent us, it was printed multiple times.

589
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:30,451
Scott: Well, in different countries, it was pretty well in English, at least it was printed by Marvel.

590
00:32:30,753 --> 00:32:38,999
Scott: Well, in English also the word with the UK versions and printed by DC and Australian versions, but it was printed by both Marvel and DC.

591
00:32:39,019 --> 00:32:40,063
Scott: That happens a lot actually.

592
00:32:40,103 --> 00:32:40,625
Rym: Yeah, I know.

593
00:32:40,946 --> 00:32:48,634
Rym: So Marvel printed it through their Epic comics label and DC printed it through their humanoids label, which was just interesting.

594
00:32:49,135 --> 00:32:50,119
Rym: I learned that from Wikipedia.

595
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:50,641
Scott: Of course.

596
00:32:50,862 --> 00:32:51,926
Rym: I wish I've got open right now.

597
00:32:52,026 --> 00:32:52,187
Rym: Yeah.

598
00:32:52,709 --> 00:32:56,123
Rym: So anyway, the in-call is the story of a man, John DeFool.

599
00:32:56,143 --> 00:32:57,048
Scott: I mean, come on then.

600
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:59,079
Scott: I was talking about the name, John DeFool, right?

601
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:09,568
Scott: I mean, come on, you could get a little better with the creative name, but obviously he is DeFool literally and figuratively all at the same time.

602
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:13,638
Scott: But I mean, come on that you so blatant.

603
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:20,455
Scott: So it's, it's, it's almost lazy, but also at the same time hero protagonist.

604
00:33:20,876 --> 00:33:21,217
Scott: Yeah.

605
00:33:21,398 --> 00:33:22,260
Scott: That's the same deal.

606
00:33:22,581 --> 00:33:23,626
Rym: I have no problem with that.

607
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:27,923
Scott: I'm just saying it's the same thing because the names in this are great.

608
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:31,074
Scott: The other names are only the John DeFool.

609
00:33:31,274 --> 00:33:31,876
Scott: Oh yeah.

610
00:33:31,956 --> 00:33:38,661
Scott: I wonder the thing is he's called meta Baron, which is sort of a bad-ass name, but it's like, he is not a Baron nor is he meta.

611
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:40,106
Rym: He is a bad-ass though.

612
00:33:40,126 --> 00:33:42,112
Scott: He is a bad-ass.

613
00:33:42,393 --> 00:33:44,640
Scott: But yeah, DeFool is the only one with a lazy name.

614
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,864
Scott: Everyone else has a pretty good name.

615
00:33:46,426 --> 00:33:47,630
Rym: Anima and Tanata.

616
00:33:47,851 --> 00:33:48,071
Scott: Yeah.

617
00:33:48,413 --> 00:33:49,135
Rym: That doesn't bother you?

618
00:33:49,296 --> 00:33:49,496
Rym: No.

619
00:33:50,379 --> 00:33:50,560
Rym: Okay.

620
00:33:51,042 --> 00:33:51,443
Scott: Not really.

621
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:52,306
Rym: Anyway.

622
00:33:52,326 --> 00:33:54,773
Rym: So John DeFool is a PI, cool dude, I guess.

623
00:33:55,074 --> 00:34:00,171
Rym: Kind of a loser, kind of smart, kind of shaggy from Scooby-Doo.

624
00:34:00,191 --> 00:34:01,637
Scott: A little better than Shaggy from Scooby-Doo.

625
00:34:01,657 --> 00:34:04,466
Rym: His character is all over the place.

626
00:34:04,687 --> 00:34:06,673
Rym: He reminds me almost even of Ataru.

627
00:34:06,974 --> 00:34:08,599
Rym: Like he's just, he's lecherous.

628
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,041
Scott: Well, it's like.

629
00:34:09,081 --> 00:34:16,478
Scott: on the one hand, it's like, it seems like he's really competent at being a PI, but on the next moment, he's just like getting into all sorts of trouble being stupid.

630
00:34:16,498 --> 00:34:20,840
Scott: And then he's being like, you know, all smart, like, no, I'm not going to go along with this bullshit.

631
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,608
Scott: I'm just going to go back to my normal life.

632
00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:22,929
Rym: Oh my God.

633
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:25,746
Rym: There's so many times in these comics where fuck all this insanity.

634
00:34:25,786 --> 00:34:26,491
Scott: I'm just going home.

635
00:34:26,592 --> 00:34:28,623
Rym: All the other characters are like, but we're going to save the world.

636
00:34:28,663 --> 00:34:29,748
Rym: He's like, this is bullshit.

637
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:30,391
Rym: I'm going home.

638
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:33,202
Scott: And then he gives in and it's like, what?

639
00:34:33,262 --> 00:34:37,650
Scott: He's just so all over, you know, clearly he is DeFool.

640
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:37,952
Scott: Yeah.

641
00:34:39,614 --> 00:34:43,806
Rym: But the way it starts is basically like, not even the way it starts.

642
00:34:43,847 --> 00:34:49,342
Rym: The one I like about the in call the most is that the characters are nothing.

643
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:54,416
Rym: They're there, but they, they're almost like set pieces.

644
00:34:54,436 --> 00:34:54,938
Rym: Yeah.

645
00:34:55,158 --> 00:34:56,664
Rym: As opposed to characters, right?

646
00:34:57,166 --> 00:34:59,295
Scott: I'd say this, I really need better words for this.

647
00:34:59,335 --> 00:35:01,164
Scott: Cause I say it about almost everything, right?

648
00:35:01,184 --> 00:35:04,000
Scott: When we talk about ponies, I'm like, Oh, look at the characters and ponies.

649
00:35:04,261 --> 00:35:05,889
Scott: They're so such full characters.

650
00:35:05,909 --> 00:35:06,894
Scott: They have personalities.

651
00:35:06,914 --> 00:35:08,040
Scott: They have all these things going on.

652
00:35:08,341 --> 00:35:12,275
Scott: You could imagine a scenario and say, what would X character do?

653
00:35:12,356 --> 00:35:17,560
Scott: And you would know what that character would do and be able to act like them or make funny jokes relating to their personality.

654
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,181
Scott: Right.

655
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:29,279
Scott: But with in call, it's like each of the characters has sort of, you know, a backstory and a plot and things like that, but they don't really have a strong personality.

656
00:35:29,319 --> 00:35:32,672
Scott: It's like, what would the meta Baron say in this situation?

657
00:35:32,973 --> 00:35:40,140
Scott: You know, if someone said this to him and it's like, um, you couldn't really make a joke, like meta Barons do this and John, the fools do that.

658
00:35:40,542 --> 00:35:43,697
Scott: You couldn't make that joke, but you could easily make the Twilight sparkle does this.

659
00:35:43,858 --> 00:35:44,963
Scott: Rainbow dash does that joke.

660
00:35:45,424 --> 00:35:59,236
Scott: Cause the characters are just so empty, but it's sort of like a lot of superhero comics have that same issue, you know, where there's just so many characters, maybe they focus on a few that aren't empty, but most of them are just shells with costumes on.

661
00:35:59,256 --> 00:36:00,561
Scott: that serves some sort of.

662
00:36:00,842 --> 00:36:06,103
Scott: the thing is, even though they don't have these personalities and character, they have roles in the plot.

663
00:36:06,786 --> 00:36:10,039
Scott: You know, it's like each character is almost like a talking McGuffin of sorts.

664
00:36:11,541 --> 00:36:15,192
Rym: But while everyone is like that, they're not bland.

665
00:36:15,412 --> 00:36:17,819
Rym: They're just not characters, right?

666
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,825
Rym: But what they are is great.

667
00:36:19,925 --> 00:36:30,472
Rym: The income from start to finish is just like set piece after set piece of just crazy crap, crazy weirdos, sci-fi world.

668
00:36:30,492 --> 00:36:34,763
Scott: The things that are happening make sense in order, right?

669
00:36:35,145 --> 00:36:39,120
Scott: Actually, there are some characters that do have character like the president at the beginning.

670
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:40,443
Scott: Oh yeah.

671
00:36:40,504 --> 00:36:40,825
Scott: Right.

672
00:36:40,845 --> 00:36:42,450
Scott: Um, but not much.

673
00:36:42,931 --> 00:36:44,295
Scott: And the character sort of disappears.

674
00:36:44,415 --> 00:36:45,880
Scott: Mostly not entirely.

675
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,004
Rym: Depot is pretty good.

676
00:36:47,385 --> 00:36:49,512
Rym: The, uh, the stone, the bird thing.

677
00:36:49,653 --> 00:36:49,914
Scott: Yeah.

678
00:36:49,954 --> 00:36:50,335
Scott: Not bad.

679
00:36:50,516 --> 00:36:50,897
Scott: Not bad.

680
00:36:50,997 --> 00:36:53,226
Rym: Cause he's, often the voice of reason.

681
00:36:53,246 --> 00:36:53,788
Rym: Yeah.

682
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:59,512
Scott: But it's mostly just, you know, follow this crazy plot that does make sense in a crazy world.

683
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:04,488
Scott: And these characters, you know, do their thing along the way and stuff happens.

684
00:37:04,829 --> 00:37:10,511
Rym: It builds to a sort of existential, this kind of thing can only go in an existential direction.

685
00:37:10,531 --> 00:37:12,159
Scott: You know, I love, that's my kind of action.

686
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:17,085
Scott: I love it whenever, you know, an anime gets crazy weird at the end, like in a Monica, Evangelion way.

687
00:37:17,286 --> 00:37:20,058
Scott: And in call definitely goes in that sort of fashion.

688
00:37:20,098 --> 00:37:28,450
Scott: If you like those sort of sci-fi anime plots or everything gets trippy to, as you get closer to the end, in call does that times 10.

689
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:30,577
Scott: And plus the Mobius art totally fits with that.

690
00:37:30,718 --> 00:37:35,652
Rym: Like, you know, handing glove giant space, baby gods and all that stuff.

691
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:43,537
Rym: But the reason I'm not talking a lot about the plot is that it goes like, it's hard to describe because it's so trippy.

692
00:37:43,858 --> 00:37:53,029
Rym: Like in the beginning, remember the super pretty androgynous God, people who rule above the crappy city and like the guy, a guy tries to commit suicide.

693
00:37:53,049 --> 00:37:56,565
Rym: And whenever someone does that bunch of other people usually just also jump.

694
00:37:56,927 --> 00:38:00,886
Rym: And then people who live in the city for fun, I'll just try to shoot them out of the sky as they fall.

695
00:38:00,926 --> 00:38:03,160
Scott: There's this whole big, it's like, it's like, think about that.

696
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:12,602
Scott: Even though these characters are nobody, that setting right there, that place, you could imagine all kinds of cool things that could happen in a place like that in a world like that, you know?

697
00:38:12,803 --> 00:38:29,269
Scott: So, you know, even though you don't care about the people, any specific people, you feel immediately you're in this place where this crazy cool stuff, you know, a lot like many other cyberpunk spacey things, you know, like, you know, Logan's run, you feel like, oh man, it's an underground place where you die when you're 30.

698
00:38:29,269 --> 00:38:30,956
Scott: You know, it's all about the place.

699
00:38:31,538 --> 00:38:31,880
Scott: Really cool.

700
00:38:33,041 --> 00:38:49,485
Rym: But then not that much later, like about halfway through from that point, which is almost right at the beginning, you get to places where there's crazy bird people who worship a fertility thing and all the, all the guys are actually sperm and you've got to run toward this disintegration chamber and have sex with it.

701
00:38:51,491 --> 00:38:51,752
Scott: Yeah.

702
00:38:52,073 --> 00:38:53,638
Rym: Cause like I don't want to be a disintegrated.

703
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:57,611
Scott: It pretty much follows a pattern of introduce a weird alien thing.

704
00:38:58,112 --> 00:39:08,392
Scott: Learn how to deal with it, deal with it, move on to next weird alien thing, you know, and beach and you get your, and in the process of dealing with the alien thing, you are transformed in an alien way.

705
00:39:08,854 --> 00:39:16,744
Scott: And then when you go to approach the next alien thing, it's their characters are transformed again and rinse and repeat until all the alien things have been dealt.

706
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:25,189
Rym: There's not a lot else I can say other than that, if you are a fan of comics, you should read this just to see.

707
00:39:25,891 --> 00:39:26,172
Scott: Yeah.

708
00:39:26,272 --> 00:39:43,358
Scott: I'm not going to say this is like so great, super amazing, but if you are a fan of cyberpunk things that get existential at the end, uh, crazy, awesome artwork, uh, it is worth reading, especially since only two volumes.

709
00:39:43,459 --> 00:39:45,788
Scott: If you can get your hands on them, it shouldn't be that hard.

710
00:39:45,828 --> 00:39:46,471
Scott: I can't imagine.

711
00:39:47,074 --> 00:39:48,118
Scott: Uh, but it's not like.

712
00:39:48,138 --> 00:39:51,152
Scott: this is must read comic of the universe or anything like that.

713
00:39:51,213 --> 00:39:54,408
Rym: This is must read comic for someone who claims to be a comic book fan.

714
00:39:54,609 --> 00:39:54,890
Scott: Yeah.

715
00:39:55,192 --> 00:40:00,820
Rym: This it's one of those things where you you'll either, you're going to love this or you're not going to get it, but it'll be memorable.

716
00:40:01,782 --> 00:40:03,528
Scott: It is something I will remember.

717
00:40:03,608 --> 00:40:05,556
Scott: I didn't really need to take notes on it.

718
00:40:05,576 --> 00:40:11,836
Rym: Like I am loathe to describe plot points though, because they're, you just got to experience it.

719
00:40:12,438 --> 00:40:26,640
Scott: Well, it's mainly, it's about this, some device called the Inca, which you don't really learn too much about, but it's always there and it can sort of go in people and it's also powerful, but there's also you suddenly, you learn a little bit later on, there's like a dark one and a light one.

720
00:40:26,981 --> 00:40:32,159
Scott: and you have that typical dark light symbolism, you know, balance and all that jazz going on.

721
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:39,635
Scott: And there are some, you know, some people want the Inca, some people have the Inca, some people want to use it for bad, some people want to use it for good.

722
00:40:39,695 --> 00:40:44,416
Rym: Now this all plays out in this sort of like space opera drama of empires and mutants.

723
00:40:44,517 --> 00:40:48,454
Rym: And there's a sort of, you know, and there's, there's a metropolis style uprising early on.

724
00:40:48,474 --> 00:40:48,614
Scott: Yeah.

725
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:54,457
Scott: And it's, you know, one alien race is actually using another alien race to, you know, work for them.

726
00:40:54,497 --> 00:40:56,726
Scott: So you sort of have that, you know, beat the guys.

727
00:40:56,867 --> 00:41:00,302
Scott: Oh wait, there was another higher level guy who was actually behind things.

728
00:41:00,362 --> 00:41:04,074
Scott: move on up the chain to more craziness situations going on.

729
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:10,542
Scott: And then, you know, of course things get so crazy up near the top, you know, the universe might be destroyed or whatever.

730
00:41:10,562 --> 00:41:15,588
Scott: So everyone's got to, you know, figure out what to do to prevent that and crazy things happen along the way.

731
00:41:15,608 --> 00:41:26,418
Rym: And the way language is used, it was originally in French, but like the, the emperor, the, the leaders, remember the, the guys with the, the guy and the girl with the head stuck together, sitting before that, like galactic, show

732
00:41:26,438 --> 00:41:26,860
Scott: me the picture,

733
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,424
Rym: the mega holiness,

734
00:41:28,825 --> 00:41:30,852
Scott: the, the emperor, the emperor risks,

735
00:41:30,932 --> 00:41:37,033
Rym: but the fact that they call him and her together, the mega holiness, like your mega holiness.

736
00:41:37,113 --> 00:41:38,518
Rym: And that's the word they use.

737
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:41,005
Rym: stuff like that is everywhere.

738
00:41:41,045 --> 00:41:45,537
Rym: The meta Baron, the mega holiness, stuff like that.

739
00:41:45,697 --> 00:41:52,460
Rym: in this kind of setting, it would be really silly and derpy anywhere else, but the way this is presented, it is dead serious.

740
00:41:53,561 --> 00:41:55,309
Scott: It's kind of crazy how they can get away with that.

741
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:55,671
Scott: Right.

742
00:41:56,012 --> 00:42:00,951
Scott: Of having such crazy weird names, but also you're not just like laughing at it.

743
00:42:01,011 --> 00:42:06,508
Scott: Like it's a joke, but in many ways it actually is sort of like almost humorous.

744
00:42:06,548 --> 00:42:20,065
Scott: It's like, if you took, you know, all it's like, if you took a snow crash and put in a little bit of hitchhiker's guide, you know, just to sort of make it wow off to the side a little bit.

745
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:21,712
Scott: I don't know.

746
00:42:21,852 --> 00:42:23,198
Scott: I can't explain it any better than that.

747
00:42:23,218 --> 00:42:24,604
Scott: You just have to see it for yourself.

748
00:42:24,805 --> 00:42:25,428
Scott: Like the matrix.

749
00:42:25,669 --> 00:42:26,814
Rym: A lot of naked people too.

750
00:42:27,236 --> 00:42:27,980
Scott: There's nothing wrong with that.

751
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:28,482
Scott: It's French.

752
00:42:28,743 --> 00:42:31,233
Rym: I was going to point out there's a, there's a lot of naked people.

753
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:35,791
Scott: You know that the first time you see anima and she's all naked way hot.

754
00:42:35,952 --> 00:42:41,288
Scott: Those are like the nicest boobies I've ever seen drawn by hand of human being.

755
00:42:41,749 --> 00:42:44,516
Rym: She's very matter of fact though.

756
00:42:44,536 --> 00:42:46,422
Scott: I just said the boobies really nice.

757
00:42:46,502 --> 00:42:48,709
Scott: I didn't say anything about anything.

758
00:42:48,809 --> 00:43:03,400
Rym: I like when he's in the disintegration chamber to have sex with the thing and it takes whatever form will be most pleasing to him, which is her and the whole time because she's with like their ground control, basically spying on him.

759
00:43:04,022 --> 00:43:07,598
Rym: She sees that and it's the way she's kind of nonchalantly reacting to.

760
00:43:07,638 --> 00:43:08,582
Rym: that is actually pretty funny.

761
00:43:08,623 --> 00:43:08,844
Rym: Yeah.

762
00:43:09,206 --> 00:43:15,050
Scott: If you want to learn how to draw boobies really nicely, you should learn from Mobius.

763
00:43:15,151 --> 00:43:15,453
Rym: I like how.

764
00:43:15,473 --> 00:43:18,210
Rym: of all the things in this comic, that's what you're really remembering.

765
00:43:18,431 --> 00:43:19,700
Scott: I remember a lot of other things.

766
00:43:20,941 --> 00:43:23,071
Scott: That's just what I mentioned because you brought that up.

767
00:43:23,251 --> 00:43:23,452
Scott: Yeah.

768
00:43:24,196 --> 00:43:35,580
Rym: But no, the in-call is, like I said, if you're a comic fan, you got to read this at least so you can talk about it in the context of comics because there's not a lot else out there that's like this.

769
00:43:35,941 --> 00:43:37,910
Rym: that is also self-contained.

770
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:38,934
Rym: There are things.

771
00:43:38,954 --> 00:43:40,300
Rym: That is also self-contained.

772
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:41,923
Scott: There are.

773
00:43:41,963 --> 00:43:42,852
Scott: You just don't know about them.

774
00:43:42,872 --> 00:43:43,317
Rym: Yeah.

775
00:43:43,357 --> 00:43:43,640
Rym: Like what?

776
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,807
Scott: Weird sci-fi things like that.

777
00:43:47,268 --> 00:43:50,220
Scott: I guess Nexus is sort of like that.

778
00:43:52,623 --> 00:43:53,869
Rym: But the fact you're struggling a little bit.

779
00:43:53,889 --> 00:43:54,874
Rym: I don't know.

780
00:43:54,894 --> 00:43:56,120
Scott: I see things like that.

781
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:00,340
Rym: There's DC Green Lantern crap, but that's a different kind of crazy and it's not self-contained.

782
00:44:01,702 --> 00:44:04,620
Scott: There is some Jim Starlin stuff, but that's a little weird.

783
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:07,951
Rym: I'm saying there are not a lot of comics like this.

784
00:44:08,674 --> 00:44:10,060
Rym: And the fact that you can read this.

785
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,907
Scott: I guess Fear Agent maybe.

786
00:44:12,409 --> 00:44:19,340
Rym: The fact that you can read this whole thing in two trades means that if you're going to read something crazy like this, you should just read this.

787
00:44:20,301 --> 00:44:22,979
Scott: Invincible also has some similar aspects in a way.

788
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:23,822
Rym: Granted.

789
00:44:24,144 --> 00:44:25,170
Scott: Invincible has the superhero aspect.

790
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:27,926
Rym: The conclusion to the whole thing?

791
00:44:27,987 --> 00:44:29,519
Rym: I wish the whole comic was drawn like that.

792
00:44:29,902 --> 00:44:30,204
Scott: I know.

793
00:44:30,304 --> 00:44:31,913
Scott: I always hate that when there's an artwork.

794
00:44:32,135 --> 00:44:33,602
Scott: That's the thing about Mobius, right?

795
00:44:33,944 --> 00:44:36,658
Scott: You look at most Mobius artwork and it's like, "Oh man, that's so

796
00:44:36,779 --> 00:44:36,960
Scott: awesome."

797
00:44:38,001 --> 00:44:39,951
Scott: Especially things he's painted and stuff like that.

798
00:44:40,353 --> 00:44:46,476
Scott: But then you look in the actual printed comic and the interior pages, they're great, but they're not as great.

799
00:44:47,058 --> 00:44:50,231
Scott: And it's like, I wonder what it looked like before it was colored.

800
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:53,126
Scott: It would probably be stunning if it wasn't colored.

801
00:44:53,146 --> 00:44:53,892
Scott: I don't know.

802
00:44:53,932 --> 00:44:54,093
Rym: Yeah.

803
00:44:54,133 --> 00:44:54,416
Rym: Serious.

804
00:44:54,456 --> 00:45:00,235
Rym: If you get to the end of this, like the last page, that style is great.

805
00:45:00,495 --> 00:45:05,939
Rym: And if the whole comic had been like that, or if they animated this and it looked like that, I don't even know what I'd do.

806
00:45:06,721 --> 00:45:07,123
Scott: Yeah.

807
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:07,605
Scott: That's all right.

808
00:45:07,786 --> 00:45:12,005
Scott: We're going to read some comics that are awesome the whole way through for awesomeness.

809
00:45:12,026 --> 00:45:14,580
Scott: I'm going to make it happen because we need some Wednesday episode.

810
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:23,101
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

811
00:45:23,141 --> 00:45:28,110
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

812
00:45:28,491 --> 00:45:33,530
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

813
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:36,465
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

814
00:45:36,626 --> 00:45:41,169
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

815

816
00:45:45,989 --> 00:45:49,083
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

817
00:45:49,263 --> 00:45:52,150
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
