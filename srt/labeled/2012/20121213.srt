00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,912
Rym: Hey, it's Thursday December 13th 2012.

2
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:13,493
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:17,778
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight off the radar.

4
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:19,440
Rym: geeks and normal people.

5
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:23,646
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,263 --> 00:00:27,969
Rym: So I'm sitting in my office doing my thing.

7
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:28,651
Rym: I got balls.

8
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:31,300
Rym: I'll meek open and I'm like fucking around with an interface.

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:36,928
Rym: I'm working on for a thing that we're gonna do and One of my co-workers is like what the fuck is that smell?

10
00:00:37,911 --> 00:00:39,997
Rym: and he starts walking around like you smell something really bad.

11
00:00:40,358 --> 00:00:44,089
Scott: the bamboo No bamboo in your office.

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,515
Scott: There's are you sure?

13
00:00:45,535 --> 00:00:46,740
Rym: I am so sure.

14
00:00:47,421 --> 00:00:49,628
Scott: This is sounding like there's a bamboo in the future.

15
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,616
Scott: So feeling it about 30 seconds.

16
00:00:51,636 --> 00:00:52,679
Scott: You're gonna say there was a bamboo.

17
00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:55,446
Rym: So I ignore it.

18
00:00:55,486 --> 00:00:57,555
Rym: cuz I'm working on stuff and I put my headphones back on.

19
00:00:57,575 --> 00:00:58,680
Rym: Did you smell something?

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,942
Rym: I did not but I did not go to investigate People.

21
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:08,263
Rym: I go out to get lunch and I come back and as I walk into the office I'm like man.

22
00:01:08,343 --> 00:01:09,708
Rym: our office smells like shit.

23
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,077
Scott: Well, you didn't smell the smell when you were leaving for lunch.

24
00:01:12,117 --> 00:01:13,642
Rym: only when you came back I guess I had been.

25
00:01:14,164 --> 00:01:19,760
Rym: either I had been immured in it and used to it or it did not exist in quantity yet.

26
00:01:20,901 --> 00:01:23,394
Scott: So maybe someone pulled it out like someone spilled the bamboo.

27
00:01:23,575 --> 00:01:23,936
Rym: so I can't.

28
00:01:23,957 --> 00:01:24,539
Rym: there's no bamboo.

29
00:01:25,222 --> 00:01:25,945
Rym: so I came back in the.

30
00:01:26,066 --> 00:01:28,154
Rym: basically this escalates over time one by one.

31
00:01:28,194 --> 00:01:34,668
Rym: people in the office now even like a bunch of People in a room and it's like three people have a conversation and then 20 minutes later Some guy says something related to

32
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:38,828
Scott: that someone with do and when you left for lunch They weren't there, but when you came back for lunch, they were there.

33
00:01:38,928 --> 00:01:39,953
Rym: Nah, nothing like that.

34
00:01:40,013 --> 00:01:43,891
Rym: So the smell is Pretty bad at this point.

35
00:01:43,992 --> 00:01:50,780
Rym: So I'm like, alright I'm gonna find this because I it's starting to remind me of the smell of a mouse that has died in a wall.

36
00:01:51,882 --> 00:01:53,694
Rym: So I start going around trying to narrow it down.

37
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:54,540
Scott: Did it smell like a bamboo?

38
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,540
Rym: It's not in the server room where I had just fucked with the HVAC system.

39
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,177
Rym: I wonder if maybe I'd end up killing a mouse in the ceiling with that, but no that was all fine.

40
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:02,840
Scott: You sure?

41
00:02:03,302 --> 00:02:03,985
Rym: Yeah, I'm sure.

42
00:02:04,146 --> 00:02:06,918
Rym: yeah, I'm you know, I already know the outcome of the story.

43
00:02:06,938 --> 00:02:10,426
Rym: I Already that the fullness of this happened today.

44
00:02:10,447 --> 00:02:11,691
Rym: I got my answer.

45
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:18,340
Rym: there was it was a. there is a time of worry Followed by a time of discovery and then a sign a time of gnosis.

46
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,208
Rym: So I'm walking around like the fuck.

47
00:02:21,228 --> 00:02:21,912
Rym: I couldn't find it.

48
00:02:21,952 --> 00:02:23,680
Rym: It seems stronger near the closet.

49
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,933
Rym: I'm like, aha, but then I opened the closet.

50
00:02:26,014 --> 00:02:27,060
Rym: It's not that strong in there.

51
00:02:27,101 --> 00:02:29,407
Rym: So I kind of back off and you know I got work to do.

52
00:02:29,468 --> 00:02:30,700
Rym: since I see people I am in me.

53
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,580
Rym: So I go back to my desk and work a little bit and another co-worker comes back from lunch.

54
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,187
Rym: She's like what the fuck is that smell?

55
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:37,572
Rym: So he starts going around looking for it.

56
00:02:38,095 --> 00:02:38,858
Rym: We can't find it.

57
00:02:39,885 --> 00:02:41,480
Scott: So called a building guy.

58
00:02:42,202 --> 00:02:51,487
Rym: yeah, the problem is I would suspect that it was something that was like we could find it in our office and the building wouldn't be happy if we're Like what the fuck is this smell.

59
00:02:51,527 --> 00:02:52,490
Rym: and then the building guy comes.

60
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,380
Rym: he's like it's this garbage in your garbage can.

61
00:02:56,689 --> 00:03:09,540
Rym: so Finally well one of my co-workers pulls out this cheese and He gots it to like eat it or something and suddenly the smell gets a thousand times work.

62
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,067
Scott: What was he doing with the cheese?

63
00:03:11,087 --> 00:03:13,156
Scott: So we're gonna pull it out from a drawer.

64
00:03:13,177 --> 00:03:17,313
Rym: So we're like How long have you had that cheese in the office?

65
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,419
Rym: and he's like.

66
00:03:19,482 --> 00:03:26,500
Rym: I don't think this cheese is the source of the dead mouse smell and further Investigation turned out that it was in fact the source of the dead mouse.

67
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,171
Scott: What the fuck was he doing with this cheese?

68
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:29,439
Scott: And why did he not smell it?

69
00:03:30,681 --> 00:03:36,260
Rym: It is a cheese that smells as far as I can tell like dead mouse by design.

70
00:03:36,361 --> 00:03:38,920
Scott: Why was it not in the refrigerator or something?

71
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,003
Rym: Well, it was.

72
00:03:40,023 --> 00:03:43,500
Rym: he was being transported like it was in a bag and like a cool pack or something.

73
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:43,781
Rym: I don't know.

74
00:03:43,802 --> 00:03:47,040
Rym: It smelled like a fucking dead mouse and he's like, alright guys, we'll take it home with me.

75
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:51,840
Scott: So it won't bother you anymore now with that cheese and don't bring any more here again.

76
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,312
Rym: So then he's like, yeah, I'm taking the train to Connecticut.

77
00:03:55,372 --> 00:03:56,576
Rym: Maybe I shouldn't bring this with me.

78
00:03:56,596 --> 00:03:57,620
Rym: No, really.

79
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:04,900
Rym: So, I'm glad that I do not engage in the social contract of the kitchen of my office.

80
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:06,135
Rym: I do not use kitchen.

81
00:04:06,943 --> 00:04:09,260
Rym: I do not use the fridge the cooking implements.

82
00:04:09,421 --> 00:04:16,250
Scott: I fought to get a separate mini fridge just for the tech people and we have one now and I fought for that for years At my old company and they wouldn't give it to.

83
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:19,608
Scott: so now we don't have to deal with the fucking Disgusting fridge all these other people use.

84
00:04:20,152 --> 00:04:21,820
Rym: why is every fridge like that?

85
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:22,583
Rym: So disgusting.

86
00:04:22,603 --> 00:04:24,875
Rym: at one point I went in there like a month ago.

87
00:04:24,956 --> 00:04:28,054
Scott: cuz you will get a food They put it at the leftover in there and they fucking leave it in there.

88
00:04:28,115 --> 00:04:28,739
Scott: They never get it.

89
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:29,404
Rym: There was?

90
00:04:29,424 --> 00:04:31,240
Scott: they buy a bamboo cheese.

91
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,498
Rym: There's the frozen spinach in the freezer that was there since before I got to the company.

92
00:04:36,598 --> 00:04:37,040
Scott: It's still there.

93
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:38,065
Rym: Yeah, it's still there.

94
00:04:38,105 --> 00:04:39,432
Scott: bought it when and why?

95
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:40,900
Rym: so I pulled it out one day.

96
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:47,280
Rym: I was like who the fuck bought this spinach and nobody in the entire company knows nobody would own up to it.

97
00:04:47,802 --> 00:04:49,329
Scott: The someone did either.

98
00:04:49,409 --> 00:04:51,920
Rym: It's someone who no longer works for throw it out the fucking window.

99
00:04:52,101 --> 00:04:55,252
Rym: So I'm thinking about and then see who goes.

100
00:04:55,332 --> 00:04:57,340
Scott: no my spinach that I got ya.

101
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:05,665
Rym: So I'm thinking I gotta do something with the spice bomb because it would be great if that spinach was like some other Companies thing.

102
00:05:05,685 --> 00:05:07,880
Rym: like some guy in an office next door found this spinach.

103
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,280
Rym: He's like what the fuck and he just put it in our office.

104
00:05:10,683 --> 00:05:12,879
Rym: I want to take the spice bomb and like put it in someone's freezer.

105
00:05:14,703 --> 00:05:16,600
Rym: It has to be someone who doesn't listen to GeekNights.

106
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,088
Scott: You do whatever you want with this.

107
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:23,877
Scott: still gotta do something with the spice bomb Put it on someone's porch and set it on fire.

108
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:28,454
Rym: if I had I was gonna leave it as Scott Johnson's house after the party.

109
00:05:28,514 --> 00:05:29,838
Rym: cuz then you brought it there.

110
00:05:29,858 --> 00:05:33,100
Rym: No But I'd imagine that you know, he has this huge party.

111
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,092
Rym: It ends these cleaning up and he's like it really smells like spice.

112
00:05:36,493 --> 00:05:38,200
Rym: and then he finds the spice bomb.

113
00:05:39,847 --> 00:05:42,420
Scott: You should move out of here and just leave it behind.

114
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:45,240
Rym: What would you think if you were like cleaning up your apartment one day?

115
00:05:46,482 --> 00:05:52,925
Rym: And like I don't know in your comics like at the bottom of your comic shelf like behind some comics There was just a spice bomb.

116
00:05:52,945 --> 00:05:53,566
Scott: There was an EGM.

117
00:05:53,988 --> 00:06:00,068
Rym: I Have not found an EGM in this apartment yet.

118
00:06:00,088 --> 00:06:01,313
Scott: Oh, it's interesting.

119
00:06:01,373 --> 00:06:07,091
Rym: Just saying that's interest just saying Okay enough inside jokes yummy news.

120
00:06:07,874 --> 00:06:08,980
Rym: Thursday after all it's.

121
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:15,460
Scott: The Google Maps for iPhone came out today.

122
00:06:16,104 --> 00:06:18,480
Rym: So iPhones actually have a real mapping application.

123
00:06:18,721 --> 00:06:21,940
Scott: Actually, you know there were a whole bunch of them and they were all adequate.

124
00:06:22,543 --> 00:06:32,280
Scott: But now the new Google Master iPhone is if you were curious Better than every other map on any mobile device ever used ever except no biking direction.

125
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,969
Rym: See the thing is that is only one flaw.

126
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:42,724
Rym: I suspect that is partly driven by the fact that you had a pretty slow crappy GPS on your previous phone.

127
00:06:42,744 --> 00:06:50,480
Rym: because I remember one time we were out and we both opened up our phones and I realized that your phone takes like a full minute to find his GPS.

128
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:58,200
Scott: No, it's apparently that's entirely software based because some programs the GPS goes like and the new Google Maps the GPS goes like BAM.

129
00:06:58,863 --> 00:07:00,712
Scott: So it's not anything to do with the hardware.

130
00:07:00,793 --> 00:07:02,039
Scott: It's the software is shitty.

131
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:14,005
Scott: Yeah I'm saying the old my old Google Maps is BAM always has been well the one I have now is BAM And the only problem is no biking directions BAM, which is the only flaw which is something that most people don't give a shit about But I do.

132
00:07:14,026 --> 00:07:15,380
Rym: it actually matters a lot.

133
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,919
Scott: But in all other ways it is a perfect map thingy.

134
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:29,711
Rym: Sometimes slashdot was like Google really should have waited on this because this was actually one thing that an Android phone did way better Aside from not being extra proprietary.

135
00:07:29,731 --> 00:07:32,140
Rym: Mmm, and now there's no longer that advantage.

136
00:07:33,104 --> 00:07:38,442
Rym: I think there were at least one or two people Not that that matters, you know one or two out of how many millions who were like You know what?

137
00:07:39,006 --> 00:07:41,500
Rym: I care about maps more than I care about iPhone.

138
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,713
Scott: Well, I saw really interesting that if you do that you buy a GPS or thing, right?

139
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:49,833
Scott: They still make those those things suck You get none of you buy this ultra high-end one.

140
00:07:49,894 --> 00:07:51,020
Rym: No, they still suck ass.

141
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,000
Rym: You know why those things are not useful for for the kinds of things?

142
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,826
Rym: I use my phone GPS for like.

143
00:07:57,488 --> 00:08:06,700
Rym: I'm in a random neighborhood in the city and I want to figure out what restaurants nearby Or get a biking direction from like the Bowery to a weird place in Brooklyn or Jersey.

144
00:08:08,182 --> 00:08:10,851
Scott: We should make a bike specific thing.

145
00:08:11,192 --> 00:08:15,662
Rym: Yes, we should because I want nothing more than Actually, I was looking.

146
00:08:15,722 --> 00:08:20,428
Rym: I'm thinking about getting a mount so I can mount my phone like a little - on my bike.

147
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:21,650
Scott: I've seen those.

148
00:08:23,362 --> 00:08:24,848
Rym: The reason I want it is that one.

149
00:08:24,868 --> 00:08:30,959
Rym: I'm playing ingress more and more and I have to be able to look at the screen While I'm biking to find the portals and fuck people's shit up

150
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:33,508
Scott: and

151
00:08:33,528 --> 00:08:45,658
Rym:  When I bike a very long distance like way outside of New York City, I kind of need the navigation Mmm, and I have more than once dropped my phone if I'm trying to hold it in my hand while I'm biking at speed.

152
00:08:46,421 --> 00:08:48,240
Scott: I have never done that.

153
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:48,802
Scott: Never dropped the phone.

154
00:08:48,883 --> 00:08:55,894
Rym: Nah, anyway anyway, so In the news, I guess the lounge I wanted to link to this thing.

155
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:03,587
Rym: It's a bunch of pictures from the subway and when I say the subway, I mean The new line they're making in the seven.

156
00:09:03,607 --> 00:09:07,820
Scott: Why don't you just already become like the full trainer to go hang out with those train guys?

157
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,602
Rym: See, here's the thing.

158
00:09:08,783 --> 00:09:09,505
Rym: I'm super.

159
00:09:09,585 --> 00:09:15,324
Rym: I mean you remember in Beacon like I did all that research and learned all about that abandoned Why don't you just go full on?

160
00:09:15,344 --> 00:09:26,100
Rym: In fact, I remember one time you were trying to argue with me that that line that that third Track and next to the train station with that abandoned platform did not in fact connect to the old line that goes to Danbury.

161
00:09:27,103 --> 00:09:28,819
Rym: And I did a lot of research to prove you wrong.

162
00:09:29,442 --> 00:09:30,989
Rym: I for some reason just got really into that.

163
00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:32,335
Rym: I found all those old stations.

164
00:09:32,355 --> 00:09:40,867
Rym: I Can't go full trainer now because as much as I like the tracks and as much as I like the routes I don't give a shit about the actual trains.

165
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,140
Rym: I just don't care and I would be a pariah in that community.

166
00:09:46,362 --> 00:09:47,408
Rym: But this is great.

167
00:09:47,488 --> 00:09:52,600
Rym: This is pictures of the subway and It's pictures of the subway that they're making now.

168
00:09:52,660 --> 00:10:01,740
Rym: So it looks the same as the normal subways like it's the inside of a subway tunnel But it's before they turned on the piss sprayers and the rat generators.

169
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:03,440
Rym: There's no grime.

170
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:11,500
Rym: It's so weird to see what the New York City subway would look like if it had no grime That I'm almost dumbfounded by these pictures.

171
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:20,549
Rym: Okay So hopefully by summer of 2014 now that we don't go to the New York Comic Con anymore We'll be able to take the seven train to the Javits.

172
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:23,862
Rym: that will probably never enter again for the rest of our lives Mm-hmm.

173
00:10:30,075 --> 00:10:35,540
Rym: But anyway in the lounge, it's things of the day and the GeekNights lounge on Thursday.

174
00:10:36,711 --> 00:10:40,980
Scott: so You know, there's a lot of old DOS games out in the world, right?

175
00:10:41,781 --> 00:10:45,618
Scott: And the thing with old DOS games is that pretty much you can't get an old DOS computer.

176
00:10:45,658 --> 00:10:50,400
Scott: DOSBox Yeah, but DOSBox while good while very good is not perfect.

177
00:10:51,182 --> 00:10:59,675
Rym: Most of the problems I found with DOSBox come from the fact that very few people left on earth Know how DOS works.

178
00:11:00,098 --> 00:11:08,221
Rym: true I mean I know how to get the drivership Sorted out if I get a weird game like even if I install free DOS and I somehow find of working 486.

179
00:11:08,221 --> 00:11:10,872
Scott: Get you know, it's not easy to get a game running on there.

180
00:11:11,475 --> 00:11:12,580
Scott: So what do you do?

181
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:19,192
Scott: Well, someone wrote this thing that is actually Somewhat of a better solution than anything I've seen.

182
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:19,814
Scott: and what this is?

183
00:11:19,854 --> 00:11:21,840
Scott: it's called M script in, right?

184
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:28,686
Scott: You might know that JavaScript is a subset Of EN script.

185
00:11:28,947 --> 00:11:30,676
Scott: is the or ECMA script or whatever.

186
00:11:30,716 --> 00:11:31,299
Scott: It's called, right?

187
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:38,479
Scott: So what this thing does is it takes what is known as LLVM bitcode and converts it to?

188
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,442
Scott: JavaScript.

189
00:11:39,522 --> 00:11:53,660
Scott: so if you have any if you have a program written in C or C plus plus you can compile it using LLVM GCC or clang which will output a binary which runs in the LLVM.

190
00:11:54,225 --> 00:11:55,900
Scott: If you don't know what that is, don't worry about it.

191
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,754
Scott: All you have to know all you have to know.

192
00:11:57,794 --> 00:12:15,932
Scott: if you know what that means You're gonna be like, oh, if you don't know what that means You're gonna be like, oh, all it means is if you have the C code for anything you can compile it Get a file run that file through this em script in thing and it will output a JavaScript and then you can get that program To run in a box on a web page.

193
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:17,180
Scott: So here is an example.

194
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:32,395
Scott: If you go to play - dune.com slash Harkonnen It's dune - in a box on a web page exactly as it was on MS-DOS 100% identical with everything working audio works graphics work.

195
00:12:32,496 --> 00:12:35,114
Scott: every did might as well be Fucking DOS there.

196
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:39,099
Scott: it is The first RTS that there ever was as far as most people know.

197
00:12:39,662 --> 00:12:41,734
Scott: Sort of the same way the astro was the first anime.

198
00:12:41,774 --> 00:12:42,518
Scott: This is the first RTS.

199
00:12:43,943 --> 00:12:56,179
Scott: So for historical reasons check it out And if you have this C code to any old-ass programs that no one can fucking run you should try to compile that shit with a modern compiler

200
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:56,259
Rym: and

201
00:12:58,601 --> 00:13:02,860
Scott: Then try to run it through the em script it and make a little web page so people can use it because I'll be awesome.

202
00:13:03,363 --> 00:13:05,495
Scott: Not too shabby not shabby at all.

203
00:13:05,897 --> 00:13:10,034
Rym: So In the spirit of linking to YouTube channels that are hilarious.

204
00:13:10,095 --> 00:13:11,260
Rym: There is a new YouTube channel.

205
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,243
Rym: This is my thing of the day.

00:13:12,283 --> 00:13:12,584
Rym: Great.

207
00:13:12,905 --> 00:13:18,440
Rym: It is meeper fish and the headlining video is this little thing of Pikachu versus Trubbish?

208
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,306
Scott: I don't know if Trubbish is a real Pokemon.

209
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,495
Rym: I don't know if Trubbish is a real Pokemon or not.

210
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:23,520
Rym: cuz I'm looking it up.

00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,008
Rym: I really only know the OG.

212
00:13:26,028 --> 00:13:27,011
Scott: I'm looking it up.

213
00:13:27,091 --> 00:13:29,820
Rym: Really don't care about Pokemon beyond that except Bidoof.

214
00:13:29,961 --> 00:13:32,797
Scott: I'm loading up the Bulbapedia and and the CeraVe.

215
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:38,335
Scott: Bibarel mostly Bidoof Trubbish real Pokemon.

216

Rym: Oh my god.

217
00:13:39,099 --> 00:13:41,545
Rym: Okay Is the truth?

Scott: number 568 poison types has abilities hem Stench.

219
00:13:46,665 --> 00:13:48,614
Scott: if the Pokemon makes physical contact with the opponent.

220
00:13:48,634 --> 00:13:49,940
Scott: There's a chance the opponent flinches.

221
00:13:50,503 --> 00:13:53,659
Scott: Nah, sticky hold the Pokemon's item cannot be taken.

222
00:13:54,462 --> 00:13:55,725
Scott: Hidden ability available.

223
00:13:55,905 --> 00:14:00,537
Scott: aftermath the foe that dealt the final hit loses a quarter of its maximum HP if the move made.

224
00:14:00,577 --> 00:14:01,560
Scott: physical contact.

225
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,480

Rym: Wow Okay Yeah, so this channel is pretty funny.

227
00:14:11,027 --> 00:14:11,730
Rym: It evolves.

Rym: She has a series.

229
00:14:13,396 --> 00:14:13,657
Rym: What's it?

230
00:14:13,697 --> 00:14:14,300
Rym: evolve into?

231
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,886
Rym: Garbodor Are you sure this isn't a joke?

237
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:31,540
Scott: No, these are poison types.

238
00:14:31,641 --> 00:14:34,140
Scott: I guess those I guess those are poison types - I don't fucking know.

239
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:44,137
Rym: But anyway, she has a series called adventures and food service and another series called adventures in retail and they're just cute somewhat full of truth and somewhat hilarious.

240
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:50,091
Scott: Garbodor Trubbish good God if anyone seeks Trubbish you're gonna lose.

241
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,355
Rym: I can't win.

242
00:14:51,395 --> 00:14:52,980
Scott: I'll just set your fucking Trubbish on fire.

243
00:14:55,904 --> 00:15:00,880
Rym: And in the meta moment the GeekNights book club book is The Great Gatsby.

244
00:15:01,486 --> 00:15:06,333
Rym: Yep, you should read it Probably not gonna do show on it till sometime early next year because we're busy with stuff.

245
00:15:06,835 --> 00:15:09,727
Rym: We launched a new show GeekNights presents.

246
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:11,174
Rym: you can see that in the YouTube channel.

247
00:15:11,194 --> 00:15:12,520
Rym: We're talking about shoujo kakamei.

248
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,728
Rym: You can see me like it.

249
00:15:13,808 --> 00:15:17,028
Rym: I don't know fucking why people like it But you guys spread the word around.

250
00:15:17,048 --> 00:15:21,647
Rym: cuz I'm gonna say this we're gonna keep doing it But we're not gonna speed up.

251
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:25,419
Rym: how often we do it unless it starts getting a lot of views.

252
00:15:26,222 --> 00:15:31,660
Rym: Cuz I like doing it but I don't like doing it enough to not go skiing every weekend.

253
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:43,552
Rym: But if if you get these videos into the tens of thousands of views Yeah We're looking at only some hundreds of views you get them into the tens of thousands We will knock this shit out faster than you can imagine.

254
00:15:43,592 --> 00:15:45,157
Scott: It's only a few hundred views each.

255
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:46,702
Scott: That's not really So.

256
00:15:47,063 --> 00:15:54,650
Rym: if you are a fan of GeekNights presents and want us to keep doing content like that It is your duty to get other people to watch it.

257
00:15:55,352 --> 00:16:02,316
Rym: if they do not watch it and the view counts do not go up We'll keep doing it just like we keep doing GeekNights, but we're not gonna.

258
00:16:02,456 --> 00:16:03,560
Rym: we're not gonna go full-on.

259
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:12,320
Rym: I could go all out and we got some other projects in the hopper that are ready to go, but Not working on them unless GeekNights presents takes off.

260
00:16:12,822 --> 00:16:19,691
Scott: you should also go to all the places we are on the internet like YouTube and Facebook and Twitter and follow us and join us and Subscribe us and all those things.

261
00:16:19,772 --> 00:16:19,933
Rym: Yep.

262
00:16:19,974 --> 00:16:24,720
Scott: G+ and You should also go to MAGFest.

263
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,643
Scott: That's right.

264
00:16:25,704 --> 00:16:29,939
Rym: mag fest is coming up right after the new year at the Gaylord in DC.

265
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,368
Rym: Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday, we'll be there all four days.

266
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:34,672
Rym: We're doing three events.

267
00:16:34,712 --> 00:16:35,494
Rym: We're on two panels.

268
00:16:35,815 --> 00:16:37,920
Rym: We're moderating a video game ethics.

269
00:16:38,522 --> 00:16:44,097
Rym: We are panelists on I believe video game genres and we are presenting beyond.

270
00:16:44,197 --> 00:16:45,340
Rym: candy land should work.

271
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,799
Scott: I'll work on that during the week where I don't have any work between Christmas and New Year's.

272
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,618
Rym: Right share that document and I will also work.

273
00:16:52,402 --> 00:16:53,854
Rym: Yeah, see we're planning stuff right here.

274
00:16:53,935 --> 00:16:54,520
Rym: live on the air.

275
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,265
Rym: That's how we do this.

276
00:16:55,667 --> 00:17:00,652
Rym: write our panel a few weeks before the con One week granted.

277
00:17:00,773 --> 00:17:01,860
Rym: we already wrote this panel.

278
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,979
Rym: We're basically just rewriting it because when we wrote this panel, you might have seen a lot of new games out there.

279
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,508
Rym: More importantly you might have seen beyond candy land.

280
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,358
Rym: We've come a long way in the last like, I don't know.

281
00:17:12,438 --> 00:17:13,848
Rym: five years They're doing lectures.

282
00:17:14,192 --> 00:17:18,419
Scott: So yeah At the very least make the slides look better and very important.

283
00:17:19,031 --> 00:17:40,636
Rym: Connecticut me and Scott along with a new member of our directorial board Kristen run the panels and workshops and special events department for Connecticut a Surprisingly large as in much larger than you'd expect it to be Massively multi-genre convention in Hartford, Connecticut next year is gonna be July 12 13th and 14th

284
00:17:40,997 --> 00:17:42,160
Scott: the week before PAX OS.

285
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,073
Rym: Yes, and we're going to pack sauce.

286
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:45,020
Rym: So awesome.

287
00:17:45,622 --> 00:17:49,857
Rym: But you might think but Rym why are you talking about a convention in July?

288
00:17:49,918 --> 00:17:54,042
Scott: It's December You were talking about like pecs prime 2013.

289
00:17:54,042 --> 00:18:00,300
Rym: Well listener, I'm talking about it because panel and workshop and lecture submissions are now live.

290
00:18:00,661 --> 00:18:03,413
Scott: Are they actually working properly with a form that doesn't suck?

291
00:18:03,473 --> 00:18:04,397
Rym: they appear to be.

292
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,180
Rym: I'm going to.

293
00:18:06,344 --> 00:18:11,220
Rym: If the email that it's supposed to send out when you submit one that tells you we got it

294
00:18:11,443 --> 00:18:12,620
Scott: Send in a test submission

295
00:18:12,904 --> 00:18:20,208
Rym: I'm going to put in a real submission because we also do panels and it's much easier for me to schedule them if I put them in through the same interface as All the people do.

296
00:18:20,268 --> 00:18:20,693
Rym: good idea.

297
00:18:20,713 --> 00:18:21,379
Scott: I should submit some.

298
00:18:23,042 --> 00:18:27,200
Rym: I'll schedule you at like midnight in the annex on Monday.

299
00:18:27,762 --> 00:18:38,428
Rym: Anyway, so if you would like to do a panel workshop lecture special event anything at Connecticut Which is a pretty fucking awesome con we had 230 something panels last year.

300
00:18:40,427 --> 00:18:41,419
Scott: We're gonna have more this year.

301
00:18:41,861 --> 00:18:47,560
Rym: We're gonna have less because I'm gonna get rid of one of the rooms and have more bigger fewer rooms some of which are.

302
00:18:47,681 --> 00:18:49,879
Scott: Hopefully we'll see how that plan goes.

303
00:18:50,523 --> 00:18:52,515
Scott: The layout is not set in stone yet.

304
00:18:52,616 --> 00:18:53,280
Scott: We are fighting.

305
00:18:53,882 --> 00:19:08,730
Rym: The reason I bring this up now is that we are going to be so far ahead of schedule this year that we're going to Start scheduling panels and workshops after magfest at the end of January Meaning you can keep submitting up and through like April or something.

306
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:12,220
Rym: I forget what the deadline is, but we're gonna start scheduling stuff.

307
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:20,460
Rym: So if you submit an awesome panel and you submit it in, you know, March I might have already scheduled all the good slots.

308
00:19:20,922 --> 00:19:22,068
Rym: I'm not gonna bump something.

309
00:19:22,088 --> 00:19:23,515
Rym: I already scheduled for you.

310
00:19:23,555 --> 00:19:29,195
Rym: No matter how good you are Let's see the guest which you're not and we're also gonna make the schedule public.

311
00:19:29,476 --> 00:19:31,947
Rym: once we start scheduling things You're gonna see panels like.

312
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,299
Scott: you're gonna see it constantly changing all the time.

313
00:19:34,781 --> 00:19:36,854
Scott: Yeah, things moving around jumping around.

314
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:37,700
Rym: It's gonna be awesome.

315
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,867
Rym: We're a ConnectiCon.

316
00:19:39,189 --> 00:19:45,788
Rym: if you went to get out of con last year We uh, there was a huge up stepping of the game We had so many was ridiculous.

317
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:49,023
Rym: the difference between ConnectiCon 2011 and 2012?

318
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:49,727
Rym: It was ridiculous.

319
00:19:49,747 --> 00:19:56,601
Rym: the difference between ConnectiCon 2010 and 2011 2013 is going to be just as different from 2012 as 2012 was from 2011.

320
00:19:56,601 --> 00:19:59,600
Scott: Yeah, the convention that improves doesn't just do the same thing over and over again.

321
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,939
Rym: I would've can't hit out a cat out a cat every other kind except packs every other kid.

322
00:20:05,182 --> 00:20:05,827
Rym: It's the lounge.

323
00:20:05,907 --> 00:20:07,439
Rym: we can talk about whatever we want here.

324
00:20:09,503 --> 00:20:11,069
Rym: Why do you hate the lounge so much?

325
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,918
Scott: Why do you love the lounge so much?

326
00:20:12,938 --> 00:20:15,575
Scott: I Feeling this is a male strip lounge.

327
00:20:15,596 --> 00:20:16,180
Scott: That's why you love it.

328
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:22,410
Rym: So I would like to make Thursday episodes much more freeform and kind of just go for it Rather than having to like force myself to do a news.

329
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,340
Rym: Just be like, hey, it's Thursday.

330
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,088
Scott: What are you gonna talk about?

331
00:20:26,449 --> 00:20:27,112
Rym: same kind of stuff?

332
00:20:27,132 --> 00:20:28,157
Rym: We're talking about right now.

333
00:20:28,177 --> 00:20:28,780
Scott: Okay, whatever.

334
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,890
Rym: So I I've run into this sort of.

335
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:45,084
Rym: I can't necessarily say it's a problem because it doesn't affect me and in fact in some ways it's good for me, but I interact especially now that we live in New York with a lot of nerds of various different stripes and a lot of normal and a

336
00:20:45,124 --> 00:20:45,965
Scott: conventions as well

337
00:20:46,325 --> 00:20:54,818
Rym: at conventions at places at meetups at events and It amazes me how many people I run into who are one?

338
00:20:56,042 --> 00:21:02,280
Rym: Not old or like having some sort of like obvious reason why they would not be connected to things.

339
00:21:03,164 --> 00:21:08,207
Rym: Two are really into something pretty specific Like video games.

340
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:10,838
Scott: what are more specific things that are nerdy?

341
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:11,240
Rym: three?

342
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:24,980
Rym: Seem to have no idea that any information about said thing exists on the internet or that anyone else in the world likes those guys Or for has any concept of the fact that there are other people in this thing or in any way related to this thing.

343
00:21:25,961 --> 00:21:33,086
Rym: And it happened so often that I all I I kind of want to talk about it and think about all the people who are The same situation.

344
00:21:33,147 --> 00:21:34,614
Scott: we just haven't met them or there did.

345
00:21:34,635 --> 00:21:37,369
Scott: they don't go to conventions They don't go to meetups or go on there.

346
00:21:37,389 --> 00:21:39,339
Rym: They're like under under the radar, right?

347
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,332
Rym: So it's like a good example is nerd NYC.

348
00:21:42,372 --> 00:21:42,955
Rym: We hang out with them.

349
00:21:42,975 --> 00:21:43,840
Rym: We go to their board game nights.

350
00:21:44,181 --> 00:21:48,554
Rym: I go to the recesses occasionally, but when I first go like new people would show up.

351
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:54,800
Rym: They're like, hey, let's play some board games But they're super into board games and already there's a hint of desperation.

352
00:21:55,561 --> 00:21:56,705
Scott: Right, but it's clear.

353
00:21:56,725 --> 00:21:59,696
Scott: There's somewhat connected because they found nerd NYC on the internet.

354
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:00,660
Scott: They showed up to it.

355
00:22:01,001 --> 00:22:02,207
Scott: They know about board games.

356
00:22:02,247 --> 00:22:03,091
Scott: They're here to play them.

357
00:22:03,111 --> 00:22:06,657
Scott: They maybe even know some of the other people there Right and they live in New York.

358
00:22:06,697 --> 00:22:14,700
Scott: Yep So not completely disconnected, but they shelter NYC and they just don't know of anything else that exists in the board game world.

359
00:22:14,821 --> 00:22:16,530
Scott: Maybe they never gone to board game geek.

360
00:22:17,133 --> 00:22:18,360
Scott: Maybe they never heard of packs.

361
00:22:18,882 --> 00:22:21,432
Scott: Maybe they never know any conventions at all.

362
00:22:21,452 --> 00:22:22,054
Rym: It's never.

363
00:22:22,135 --> 00:22:23,440
Rym: just one thing.

364
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:28,973
Rym: It's that I'll be talking to some random person, you know They're really into board games and they'll sell.

365
00:22:28,993 --> 00:22:30,781
Rym: they'll tell me some ridiculous rumor Like.

366
00:22:31,243 --> 00:22:36,246
Rym: I heard there's a sequel to settlers coming out called and they make something up Like I'm trying to.

367
00:22:36,266 --> 00:22:38,335
Rym: the Star Trek settlers is coming out so I can't use that.

368
00:22:38,476 --> 00:22:39,179
Scott: Is that really?

369
00:22:39,219 --> 00:22:40,403
Scott: Yeah I'm looking that up right now.

370
00:22:40,423 --> 00:22:42,169
Rym: So Star Wars settlers.

371
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,477
Rym: I heard it's coming and that's not coming.

372
00:22:44,497 --> 00:22:45,240
Rym: That doesn't exist.

373
00:22:45,743 --> 00:22:46,972
Scott: Are you fucking kidding me?

374
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:48,019
Scott: Star Trek Catan?

375
00:22:48,802 --> 00:22:49,724
Scott: What the fuck.

376
00:22:50,065 --> 00:22:55,679
Rym: but these like they'll bring up a piece of social currency like hey have you heard about X?

377
00:22:56,101 --> 00:22:57,870
Scott: I think it's out out not coming out.

378
00:22:57,971 --> 00:22:59,580
Rym: Yeah, I saw some pictures of people playing.

379
00:23:00,917 --> 00:23:07,544
Rym: so settlers is going to be the monopoly of our generation in terms of being matched up with everything in a Superficial manner.

380
00:23:07,785 --> 00:23:10,556
Scott: you just go get settlers of Canaan and play that and never play any others.

381
00:23:10,817 --> 00:23:13,431
Rym: Yeah Settlers of your mom.

382
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:17,021
Rym: Yeah But so they'll They'll.

383
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:31,160
Rym: I don't know if they make it up or what but the kinds of news that I get out of these disconnected nerds is identical to the kind of news I would get out of kids in the days before the internet who would literally just make shit up about video games.

384
00:23:31,561 --> 00:23:37,119
Scott: And the thing I first time I ever recognized this problem was at that anime next to and to the only anime next.

385
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:44,240
Scott: you went To and our friend Ian levenstein did a Nintendo panel and it was a filled up room because the Wii was about to come out.

386
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,366
Scott: it was just before the Wii was coming out and People are you know.

387
00:23:47,406 --> 00:23:54,680
Scott: he talked about all this stuff and basically everything He said was something that I had read on Kotaku or joystick or some in gadget or some gaming site.

388
00:23:55,082 --> 00:23:56,691
Scott: You know he didn't have any more information than we do.

389
00:23:56,732 --> 00:23:58,180
Scott: he doesn't work for Nintendo or anything.

390
00:23:58,622 --> 00:24:01,495
Scott: I think his girlfriend works for Pokemon, but it's not like she knew anything either.

391
00:24:01,515 --> 00:24:05,579
Scott: right, so You know I don't remember if she was there.

392
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,102
Scott: I don't know.

393
00:24:06,122 --> 00:24:06,725
Scott: what does the matter?

394
00:24:06,785 --> 00:24:16,260
Scott: the point is most of the we've talked about this on the show before probably in the anime next episode Where the people in the audience didn't know this stuff, and they asked him questions.

395
00:24:16,481 --> 00:24:28,530
Scott: I guess thinking he knew something or was somehow a Nintendo employee or had special information All he had was the same information I had reading on the internet me and him Where I could have done that panel because I knew the same things he did.

396
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:33,894
Rym: because I read websites now before you say oh Isolated phenomena you know it's anecdotal evidence.

397
00:24:33,954 --> 00:24:34,859
Rym: It's an anime account.

398
00:24:34,899 --> 00:24:43,289
Rym: well Yeah We we've been at other conventions doing panels and the same thing happens to us like remember that we did that panel On Advance Wars as those kids are like.

399
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,097
Rym: so when's the next Advance Wars coming out?

400
00:24:45,338 --> 00:24:45,600
Rym: We're like.

401
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:47,082
Rym: We don't know.

402
00:24:47,484 --> 00:24:48,747
Rym: we don't work for Nintendo.

403
00:24:48,767 --> 00:24:50,412
Rym: They're like how is this part design.

404
00:24:50,653 --> 00:24:51,274
Rym: We don't know.

405
00:24:51,856 --> 00:24:53,180
Rym: we don't work for Nintendo.

406
00:24:53,762 --> 00:24:54,324
Scott: Yeah, we didn't.

407
00:24:54,344 --> 00:24:55,247
Scott: what do you think this is?

408
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:58,780
Rym: and they kept asking questions like that after our answer continued to buy.

409
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,711
Scott: But see those questions are the problem of not knowing who's on stage.

410
00:25:01,752 --> 00:25:03,880
Scott: the other questions like you know how many?

411
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,347
Scott: Controllers are the we come with?

412
00:25:05,387 --> 00:25:05,849
Scott: it's like that.

413
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:13,966
Scott: you could just read that fucking shit on Wikipedia Or in gadget or if you've been following the news at all you would know exactly what comes with it And what the software is gonna look like.

414
00:25:13,986 --> 00:25:17,460
Scott: and all this stuff would not be a mystery or a secret whatsoever.

415
00:25:18,023 --> 00:25:19,171
Rym: But it goes deeper than that.

416
00:25:19,231 --> 00:25:31,497
Rym: like a lot of the gamer people I meet have it's very even video game people who like play Xbox games online And listen to like fast karate like they're like video games are my thing.

417
00:25:31,517 --> 00:25:37,103
Rym: and yet They've never heard of packs or penny arcade Ever never heard.

418
00:25:37,404 --> 00:25:41,055
Rym: I've met people at gaming cons who have never heard of the concept of a webcomic.

419
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,454
Rym: I Was talking to a dude about packs.

420
00:25:44,495 --> 00:25:45,060
Rym: he's like packs.

421
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:50,260
Rym: I'm again the penny arcade expose this giant video game convention, and he's like video game conventions.

422
00:25:50,401 --> 00:25:51,732
Rym: What what goes on at those?

423
00:25:51,773 --> 00:25:54,457
Rym: and I was like Play video games.

424
00:25:55,662 --> 00:25:58,573
Rym: Do you other people have you ever had penny arcades like what's penny arcade?

425
00:25:58,673 --> 00:25:59,576
Rym: Do you like?

426
00:25:59,637 --> 00:26:00,480
Rym: it's a webcomic?

427
00:26:01,062 --> 00:26:07,698
Rym: Do you even read and he's like webcomic what you mean like a comic on the internet, and I'm like Yeah.

428
00:26:08,922 --> 00:26:13,300
Rym: But the fact that you asked that leads me to worry about the direction and future of this conversation.

429
00:26:16,481 --> 00:26:29,638
Rym: But yet that dude was the biggest fan of that guy with the glasses in the world Mmm, so I think what's happening here is We're not talking about the people who don't know anything and are connected to anything.

430
00:26:29,658 --> 00:26:33,854
Scott: well I mean because the fact is those people probably do exist in probably a large number.

431
00:26:33,874 --> 00:26:38,209
Scott: some guy really fucking loves video games But just isn't connected, but we don't know that guy.

432
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:42,347
Scott: we can't find him, but these are people who have access to Everything right.

433
00:26:42,388 --> 00:26:44,120
Scott: there's really like they're slightly connected.

434
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:50,680
Scott: It's like they've hooked in to one or maybe two communities, but they do not branch for those communities at all.

435
00:26:50,761 --> 00:26:52,659
Scott: It's like this is whole internet out there.

436
00:26:53,041 --> 00:27:03,020
Scott: But they went on the internet the first day and they found I guess that guy with the glasses right and they put their hooks In and all they do now is go to that guy with the glasses, and that's it.

437
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,044
Scott: They don't go anywhere else.

438
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,008
Rym: people go to our forum.

439
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:08,040
Scott: They don't know anything else exists, right?

440
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,939
Scott: They don't you know, but the people on our forum.

441
00:27:10,281 --> 00:27:15,340
Scott: It's clear that they go elsewhere because they're constantly posting links to other things all over the internet.

442
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,212
Scott: So they're finding and digging from all their other communities right some people in our farm.

443
00:27:19,233 --> 00:27:24,428
Scott: That's true, but you know who you are me You know I go to lots of.

444
00:27:24,448 --> 00:27:26,559
Scott: I go to everywhere in the Internet's right so it's like.

445
00:27:27,222 --> 00:27:28,247
Scott: But there's other people's like.

446
00:27:28,267 --> 00:27:35,745
Scott: they just pick one thing and they stay there And they don't even think of look at anywhere else or learning and they don't search for things They don't read things and it's like.

447
00:27:35,785 --> 00:27:36,427
Rym: so think about this.

448
00:27:36,507 --> 00:27:37,491
Rym: It's interesting.

449
00:27:37,511 --> 00:27:40,200
Scott: You're really interested in tabletop RPGs.

450
00:27:40,602 --> 00:27:43,120
Scott: Why aren't you going out and looking at every major?

451
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,569
Scott: Tabletop RPG site every day of your life?

452
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,100
Scott: if that is your thing that is your jam.

453
00:27:48,463 --> 00:27:50,080
Scott: Why are you not eating your jam now?

454
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:54,435
Rym: I think what they're doing is they go to they find a site and they've net like.

455
00:27:54,455 --> 00:27:58,973
Rym: remember the first time we saw The ninja the guy who did the ninja advice.

456
00:27:59,074 --> 00:28:00,160
Rym: ask a ninja ask a ninja.

457
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:09,200
Rym: That was the most hilarious shit ever for a few episodes, but even then we recognized immediately Oh, this is basically the same shtick as strong bad and homestar runner.

458
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:10,209
Scott: Yeah, only the you know.

459
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,439
Rym: so we enjoyed a little bit.

460
00:28:11,761 --> 00:28:20,192
Rym: But we'd been zebra storyteller when we originally found the source of this to remove the zebra storyteller situation Where the first time we saw a strong bad email.

461
00:28:20,413 --> 00:28:21,820
Rym: it was the funniest thing in the world.

462
00:28:22,241 --> 00:28:30,240
Rym: It would be like if when we encounter one of those peak internet or media experiences we decided that that was the end.

463
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:44,159
Rym: Imagine if today's God we just followed the homestar runner run all I guess when nothing else And the only internet things we knew about were things that people in the homestar on all community linked to.

464
00:28:45,382 --> 00:28:49,040
Rym: So how is this happening in an age where you have access to everything?

465
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:53,920
Rym: I mean we live through the era when porn would just appear whether you wanted to see it or not on a computer.

466
00:28:54,543 --> 00:28:56,792
Rym: We live through the era of pop-up ads coming and going.

467
00:28:56,993 --> 00:28:58,639
Rym: I mean I know what an x10 camera is.

468
00:29:00,282 --> 00:29:01,407
Rym: With all this information.

469
00:29:01,427 --> 00:29:03,858
Rym: How are there people who will sort of?

470
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:12,965
Rym: advocate all media filtration to one entity, but they don't even relegate it to like an Aggregator like it's not.

471
00:29:13,146 --> 00:29:14,070
Rym: these people aren't like.

472
00:29:14,271 --> 00:29:16,139
Rym: I just go to FARC and that's all my news.

473
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:26,100
Rym: They at relegate it to the community around something like that Like they'll really like the only learn about internet things from the forum about that guy with the glasses.

474
00:29:27,581 --> 00:29:28,847
Rym: How do you get to be that person?

475
00:29:29,469 --> 00:29:29,710
Scott: I don't.

476
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:32,180
Scott: I think maybe you know on one hand, right?

477
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:36,898
Scott: We sort of have a problem where we Internet so much that we need more novelty and the.

478
00:29:36,918 --> 00:29:37,280
Scott: what is it?

479
00:29:37,741 --> 00:29:38,925
Scott: The serotonin?

480
00:29:39,145 --> 00:29:40,470
Scott: is it dopamine or serotonin?

481
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:43,820
Scott: I think it's serotonin there the brain chemicals that make you feel good.

482
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:48,657
Scott: We need all those right and we are pretty much dulled on those because we've been pounding our brains with them.

483
00:29:48,697 --> 00:29:50,404
Scott: for you know Forever we go.

484
00:29:50,424 --> 00:29:53,820
Rym: we get the shakes if we don't have our fix of novelty exactly.

485
00:29:53,961 --> 00:30:02,374
Scott: So if I go to one internet community, you know, I freaking drain that motherfucker The same way that like, you know a frat guy empties the keg all on his own.

486
00:30:02,414 --> 00:30:03,760
Scott: He's like where he's not even drunk.

487
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,086
Scott: He's like, where's the more now?

488
00:30:05,126 --> 00:30:08,100
Rym: I'm better than I was in our IT when I had jobs or I didn't do anything.

489
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:08,823
Scott: yeah, I'm much of it.

490
00:30:08,863 --> 00:30:18,880
Rym: but the point is sit there reading FARC and I considered paying for total FARC or Or going through the initiation to join ultra FARC just to get more novelty.

491
00:30:19,061 --> 00:30:21,520
Scott: The point is I go to Reddit and it's up all purple links.

492
00:30:21,782 --> 00:30:24,280
Scott: So I go to our forum and there's nothing that no new posts.

493
00:30:24,461 --> 00:30:27,534
Scott: So I'll go to Twitter and there's no new posts and I'll go right.

494
00:30:27,554 --> 00:30:30,648
Scott: so I keep going, you know I'm like, I've read everything and all the things.

495
00:30:30,688 --> 00:30:31,994
Scott: I'm gonna go check out Y Combinator.

496
00:30:32,255 --> 00:30:33,320
Scott: I'm gonna go check out Google News.

497
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:38,254
Scott: I'm gonna go and I eventually I Circle around and I got a lot of play go to Boing Boing and I'll go.

498
00:30:38,274 --> 00:30:42,489
Scott: I just eat going to places More and more places to find more and more new things.

499
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:46,260
Scott: and it takes a while before I can circle around to the beginning.

500
00:30:46,722 --> 00:30:47,144
Rym: I think of this.

501
00:30:47,365 --> 00:30:48,630
Rym: take the big aggregators.

502
00:30:48,911 --> 00:30:53,589
Rym: if you follow even one of those You'll get like 80% of this stuff.

503
00:30:53,609 --> 00:30:56,540
Rym: Like if you follow like Kotaku, you'll know the penny arcade expo exists.

504
00:30:56,741 --> 00:31:00,773
Scott: The other thing that I do is when I get one of these places, right?

505
00:31:01,114 --> 00:31:04,071
Scott: I fucking branch, you know It's like if I hit.

506
00:31:04,173 --> 00:31:15,949
Scott: you know Boing Boing and there's like a one post and it's about something I can probably find like three related YouTube videos and two Wikipedia articles and something and two other things to that link from that.

507
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:21,778
Scott: so I can fully absorb all the information related to that post to Get it in its fullness.

508
00:31:22,362 --> 00:31:26,980
Scott: Right, and that's where things of the day and news has come from but even some people in our forum are talking about how?

509
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:37,637
Rym: Like on reddit people will repost content into reddit Because they know that the people in reddit won't even bother clicking on the link to go read something somewhere else.

510
00:31:37,998 --> 00:31:39,084
Scott: in many cases I don't get it.

511
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:45,560
Rym: or if they follow a link It seems like the people who are disconnected will literally do the opposite of what you said.

512
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,459
Rym: They'll follow a link to a pay an endpoint a page.

513
00:31:48,801 --> 00:31:53,213
Rym: Whatever that page is is as far as they will ever go in following further links.

514
00:31:53,754 --> 00:31:55,900
Scott: Yeah, it's like I'm desperate to find new shit.

515
00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:01,132
Scott: So I'll follow links to like, you know Dead end of some interesting sort of things.

516
00:32:01,172 --> 00:32:12,054
Rym: like if you go to any random internet forum community You'll see the same set of like 15 threads of people asking these kind of Basic life questions and getting different answers depending on whatever.

517
00:32:12,074 --> 00:32:12,536
Rym: can that?

518
00:32:12,596 --> 00:32:14,606
Scott: yeah, that's the one thing I notice all the time.

519
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:18,466
Scott: right is like, you know, let's say you have I don't know.

520
00:32:18,486 --> 00:32:19,415
Scott: Let's try mine.

521
00:32:19,435 --> 00:32:20,000
Rym: Here's the example.

522
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,916
Scott: So you go to the Minecraft forums right like?

523
00:32:21,956 --> 00:32:25,960
Scott: not, you know Because it's like every friggin forum in the world has a Minecraft thread, right?

524
00:32:26,261 --> 00:32:28,469
Scott: But there's only one minecraft communities.

525
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:31,420
Scott: you go to the minecraft community and what thread are you gonna see?

526
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:54,720
Scott: There's some guy saying hey guys, you know let's talk about tabletop RPGs and all the people who are playing minecraft in the minecraft community or hardcore minecraft people who also like tabletop RPGs will post in that thread as opposed to You know in an off-topic area as opposed to also opening up in a new tab some sort of tabletop RPG community.

527
00:32:55,303 --> 00:33:05,516
Scott: it's like they can only be in one community for some reason and They're gonna anything that they care about in their lives because most people I hope care about more than one thing and not just Silver Age spider-man.

528
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,411
Scott: Well, but they don't want to be in more than one community.

529
00:33:09,451 --> 00:33:15,152
Scott: So anything else they care about in their lives They will post about in that forum that they're in now.

530
00:33:15,232 --> 00:33:17,660
Scott: This is a prize opposed to getting more forums.

531
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:29,767
Rym: This is a problem for a separate reason that I've found that people who are in those communities are also extremely xenophobic when it comes to Information coming in.

532
00:33:30,089 --> 00:33:31,477
Rym: that is not from one of them.

533
00:33:31,497 --> 00:33:40,774
Rym: Mmm like I don't really post on reddit that much but once I Posted a link to a relevant video on this particular subreddit.

534
00:33:41,014 --> 00:33:49,200
Rym: That was about like mechanism design and RPGs Like there's people talking about like how role-playing games can guide players.

535
00:33:49,542 --> 00:33:52,698
Rym: So I posted a link to our video on the lecture about just that.

536
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,743
Rym: Downvoted to all.

537
00:33:54,803 --> 00:33:55,164
Rym: fuck.

538
00:33:55,545 --> 00:34:05,500
Rym: not because it was self-promotion because I posted it there but had not engaged sufficiently with the conversation In the community outside of that thread.

539
00:34:05,881 --> 00:34:13,440
Scott: Beforehand, I noticed that that sort of thing happens when there's a. it's like depends the size of the community for that kind of behavior.

540
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:18,128
Scott: Right because if you it's it and it also the right because you look at say a big community.

541
00:34:18,168 --> 00:34:29,179
Scott: There was a thing going down in the red the hockey reddit yesterday where people were voting up these sort of like pictures of ice girls because there's nothing else to Post and I was down voting all of them, right?

542
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:29,882
Scott: Cuz it's like I don't want.

543
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:33,399
Scott: you know, not that they're not hot but that's not appropriate for it.

544
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,966
Scott: It's supposed to be about hockey.

545
00:34:35,266 --> 00:34:38,708
Scott: put that in the you know, the hot girls subreddit or something You know.

546
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:47,389
Scott: take that out of here And like there was you know, if you look vote wise There are a lot of people out there who vote and never comment.

547
00:34:47,771 --> 00:34:50,120
Scott: there was so that there's a lot of people in that subreddit.

548
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:55,020
Scott: So this thing had a lot of up votes and it was up there, but he looked at the comments.

549
00:34:55,422 --> 00:34:58,716
Scott: There were some people who were like, hey, this is good.

550
00:34:58,756 --> 00:34:59,540
Scott: You guys should keep it up.

551
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,019
Scott: But most of the comments were like, yeah, let's get this stuff out of here.

552
00:35:02,421 --> 00:35:06,014
Scott: The people who are more does, you know, depending on their level of involvement.

553
00:35:06,034 --> 00:35:13,840
Rym: based on statistics from our own forum It appears that the vast majority people who go to our forum lurk never post but read it religiously.

554
00:35:14,422 --> 00:35:15,366
Scott: Yeah, don't do that.

555
00:35:15,426 --> 00:35:18,157
Scott: You should be if you want to be a modern connected person.

556
00:35:18,177 --> 00:35:18,840
Scott: Who's awesome.

557
00:35:19,202 --> 00:35:22,079
Scott: You need to post and create and get involved in all the places.

558
00:35:22,762 --> 00:35:28,429
Rym: so what I was gonna get out here is that I Only engage in one forum community nerd NYC.

559
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:32,020
Rym: I post like once a month to say I will or will not attend this event.

560
00:35:32,306 --> 00:35:32,900
Scott: I don't even do that.

561
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,712
Rym: I otherwise don't post and every time I log in there's like a million p.m.

562
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:36,235
Rym: Is for me.

563
00:35:36,858 --> 00:35:37,380
Rym: I'm like really?

564
00:35:38,162 --> 00:35:39,989
Rym: You can't find me on the rest of the internet.

565
00:35:40,792 --> 00:35:48,385
Rym: I don't post content anywhere into into any forum or community Except my own GeekNights.

566
00:35:48,405 --> 00:35:48,645
Rym: Come here.

567
00:35:48,685 --> 00:35:50,290
Scott: I mean, no, you mean you're making.

568
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:56,710
Rym: you don't post content, right but your comments or anything, but The majority of my stuff like that.

569
00:35:57,052 --> 00:36:05,120
Rym: I post publicly to things like Twitter Mm-hmm, and that's where all my sort of comments are and all my things like that are.

570
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:10,800
Rym: Then the point is you post in on a regular basis.

571
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:25,379
Scott: The point is you're still involved in posting things on the internet and communicating with people and getting together with people You know and at least some places It's weird if you just read things on the internet You'd never create anything or share anything or say anything or you know, it's like come on.

572
00:36:25,701 --> 00:36:27,327
Scott: But I was saying about the sizes of the community.

573
00:36:27,367 --> 00:36:39,419
Scott: right when a community is a smaller right though You know it that vocal group, you know the group that's really into it is mostly going to control things Especially if there's some sort of voting mechanism, right?

574
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:50,856
Scott: So in your example of posting the our video it was downvoted and probably a smaller Subreddit where those people who had those sort of community ideas of who are you here will vote you down.

575
00:36:51,337 --> 00:36:56,991
Scott: if you had been in a larger Subreddit face mob the faceless mob would ten.

576
00:36:57,031 --> 00:37:01,704
Scott: who doesn't you know care about or even know about those things because they're not In the community really?

577
00:37:01,724 --> 00:37:06,640
Scott: they're just like reading and content would vote things up or down based on whether they liked it or not.

578
00:37:07,061 --> 00:37:15,151
Scott: So in those cases you get like a fistful of downvotes from the people who are way into it and a mountain of upvotes Just because it's content that they like.

579
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:15,593
Scott: they see it.

580
00:37:15,714 --> 00:37:18,429
Scott: They see a JPEG they go, haha And they click up right.

581
00:37:18,771 --> 00:37:20,360
Scott: and all those people who are you know?

582
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:30,914
Scott: Who are into it are the only people who are gonna bother to look at who posted the JPEG who they are and think about Other reasons into their voting as opposed to just quickly voting, you know an example

583
00:37:30,954 --> 00:37:33,102
Rym: of all this stuff that I ran into recently work Right.

584
00:37:33,122 --> 00:37:35,980
Rym: I'm trying to fix the AC in this like kind of isolated server room.

585
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:39,555
Rym: So at one point just to make sure that what I decided to do was correct.

586
00:37:39,956 --> 00:37:40,800
Rym: I googled for something.

587
00:37:41,101 --> 00:37:44,480
Rym: I'll google for it right now and hopefully the same thing will happen.

588
00:37:44,681 --> 00:37:46,670
Scott: I'd yet a lot of you'll just don't fucking Google.

589
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:47,715
Rym: so I need to know a thing.

590
00:37:47,815 --> 00:37:52,336
Rym: So I let's see air-conditioned sealed room.

591
00:37:56,154 --> 00:37:59,439
Rym: Sealed room All right.

592
00:38:00,126 --> 00:38:06,030
Rym: link number one THC forum community for growing in marijuana.

593
00:38:06,111 --> 00:38:11,234
Rym: Okay link number two a separate Marijuana growing community.

594
00:38:11,395 --> 00:38:15,926
Rym: I guess three a third completely independent marijuana girl there.

595
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:20,540
Rym: every link on the front page I guess people they say isn't?

596
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:27,369
Rym: we'd probably need air-conditioned sealed rooms, but No, I'm not really amazed at the fact that that is every link.

597
00:38:28,379 --> 00:38:29,489
Rym: It's when I search for this thing.

598
00:38:29,691 --> 00:38:34,949
Rym: I'm amazed that every one of these links goes to a completely separate marijuana community.

599
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:36,818
Scott: now I'm not saying right I agree.

600
00:38:36,878 --> 00:38:39,450
Scott: I see where you're going, but there shouldn't be just one weed community.

601
00:38:40,092 --> 00:38:44,745
Rym: What I'm saying is I see this on the internet everywhere that like RPGs.

602
00:38:44,765 --> 00:38:54,677
Rym: There's like 10 or 15 forums Let's say they're all about indie tabletop RPGs and every one of them has the same 11 threads And every one of them is the same shit.

603
00:38:54,817 --> 00:38:58,590
Rym: answers in those to 11 threads all from different people.

604
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:08,416
Scott: Yeah and if you none of those people had bothered to Google their question to find the thread on one of the other forums before I Therefore into a lot of these forums.

605
00:39:09,017 --> 00:39:10,541
Rym: the answers are straight-up wrong.

606
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:13,910
Rym: None of the people in these communities know anything about air conditioning.

607
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:21,905
Rym: Yet they all give these answers and ask these crazy Ridiculous questions that it's like they don't understand basic physics.

608
00:39:22,247 --> 00:39:29,889
Rym: one guy's like yeah You could just put a. get one of those portable air conditioners disconnect the hoses You know the tubes that vent the air out to the exhaust and just put it in the room.

609
00:39:30,473 --> 00:39:31,277
Scott: No, you can't.

610
00:39:31,317 --> 00:39:33,469
Rym: no that'll hit the room up you pig fucker.

611
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:44,750
Scott: But anyway But this is this is a problem that stack overflow and stack exchange has tried to solve with the question answer thing specifically.

612
00:39:45,172 --> 00:39:49,350
Rym: But the people who have this problem the most never go to those sites exactly.

613
00:39:49,591 --> 00:39:56,969
Scott: So they those sites are really good because number one if you go to them You're good, right and they have communities that form around them as well.

614
00:39:57,350 --> 00:40:02,930
Scott: Oh my god, but they've done a very clever thing and that every stack exchange site has a meta.

615
00:40:03,231 --> 00:40:12,270
Scott: So all of that community bullshit is separated out from the actual question-answer part that everyone sees Into a backlot that where you have to specifically engage there.

616
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:14,870
Scott: So it's sort of like a little segregation and it works really well.

617
00:40:15,412 --> 00:40:23,337
Scott: the main problem with that is if you're a googler you someone who has the reflex to Google something and you Google a question and It exists on a stack exchange site.

618
00:40:23,718 --> 00:40:26,650
Scott: You will find it as in a top Google result, which is really good.

619
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:35,930
Rym: Also, but these people's first instinct seems to be go to it, you know in the real world Hang out at all the time and ask my friend exactly some guy who's really into weed.

620
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:36,494
Scott: That's his number.

621
00:40:36,574 --> 00:40:43,305
Scott: one thing is in that weed form that big popular one You just found right and he wants to ask a question about Minecraft.

622
00:40:43,505 --> 00:40:47,109
Scott: doesn't go to the Minecraft community Doesn't find the Minecraft stack exchange doesn't Google it.

623
00:40:47,391 --> 00:40:52,654
Scott: He goes to his weed is for him with all his weed friends and says hey guys Anyone play Minecraft?

624
00:40:52,735 --> 00:40:55,282
Scott: anyone know the recipe to build a diamond pick?

625
00:40:55,342 --> 00:41:01,703
Scott: I saw this guy had one yo, and it's like Dude, you didn't even need to ask that in you.

626
00:41:01,783 --> 00:41:04,776
Scott: and not only did you not need to ask that you could have googled it And find it out in two seconds.

627
00:41:05,279 --> 00:41:09,121
Scott: You asked it in a weed forum Even though that's your place.

628
00:41:09,261 --> 00:41:10,870
Scott: Okay, so you're better with your.

629
00:41:11,921 --> 00:41:14,385
Rym: One of these is not a weed forum.

630
00:41:14,746 --> 00:41:17,630
Rym: It's the Anand tech hardware and technology forum.

631
00:41:17,811 --> 00:41:26,581
Rym: Okay, so in the sub forum under hardware and technology, there is the highly technical forum Mmm, and the post here.

632
00:41:26,662 --> 00:41:28,410
Rym: I'm gonna read it in its entirety.

633
00:41:29,494 --> 00:41:33,596
Scott: This is in the highly technical form Put the air conditioner in the middle of the room with the whole.

634
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:38,550
Rym: how does sealed air condition room get oxygen so we not suffocate?

635
00:41:39,433 --> 00:41:44,070
Rym: Hi all I always wonder how hotel rooms get oxygen in the rooms that people don't suffocate it.

636
00:41:44,391 --> 00:41:45,999
Rym: They sealed two doors and windows.

637
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:47,908
Rym: the air condition in there does not have.

638
00:41:47,949 --> 00:41:54,030
Rym: yes It's a fucking side in like first time window unit that option you can turn fresh air over.

639
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:58,584
Scott: So what hotel is he staying in with bulkhead fucking doors like car air condition?

640
00:41:58,624 --> 00:42:00,670
Rym: do those air condition regenerate oxygen?

641
00:42:00,771 --> 00:42:02,805
Rym: I hope some engineer can coming and provide answer.

642
00:42:02,825 --> 00:42:08,568
Rym: Thank you and The rest of the thread is a big debate about this.

643
00:42:14,261 --> 00:42:16,156
Scott: So I Mean look at look at our forum.

644
00:42:16,196 --> 00:42:16,999
Scott: For example, right?

645
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:18,726
Scott: You know, we're we're technology people.

646
00:42:18,766 --> 00:42:24,650
Scott: we talk about technology But there's a thread in our forum where people ask for like technology help with their computer doesn't work.

647
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:27,541
Scott: It's like get that shit the fuck out of here, right?

648
00:42:27,601 --> 00:42:28,384
Scott: It's like come on go.

649
00:42:28,424 --> 00:42:30,090
Scott: that answer is elsewhere on the internet.

650
00:42:30,171 --> 00:42:31,730
Scott: This is not the place, you know.

651
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:37,172
Scott: I mean we talk about a lot of different stuff on our forum because we cover a lot of topics and you shouldn't just talk About GeekNights there.

652
00:42:37,192 --> 00:42:38,717
Scott: That would be dumb and weird.

653
00:42:38,777 --> 00:42:43,252
Scott: but a lot of stuff like that is sort of like don't you know how to Internet?

654
00:42:43,292 --> 00:42:46,889
Scott: there's more websites than just this one and they're much they're going to.

655
00:42:46,929 --> 00:42:50,769
Scott: you know Even if I could answer you and I probably could or I could help you.

656
00:42:51,472 --> 00:42:55,670
Scott: You will get much better help and much better answers if you go to fucking Stack Overflow or something.

657
00:42:56,171 --> 00:42:57,114
Rym: Here's what things going on.

658
00:42:57,515 --> 00:42:59,180
Rym: these people for whatever reason.

659
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:13,188
Rym: there is something that causes certain people and it's not just a generational thing because as people who are our age and younger There's like a subset of those people who just don't connect to things on the internet and there's a subset of people who do in the land.

660
00:43:13,753 --> 00:43:23,150
Rym: We noticed this when we were at RIT anime but we didn't realize the importance of it because back then we ran the anime club and One you know the booze the biggest club on campus.

661
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:30,349
Rym: it was huge and we had crazy like posters all over campus every week these big dance parties and social nights and all this bullshit.

662
00:43:30,409 --> 00:43:37,187
Rym: and At the end of one school year We met someone who was like, oh my god, you guys are into anime man.

663
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:45,449
Rym: I wish there were other people in school her into anime than just us and we were like, uh Anime clubs the biggest club on campus.

664
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:49,447
Scott: Did you not notice the posters we hang up everywhere in the entire school every week?

665
00:43:49,508 --> 00:43:52,217
Rym: and he was like How was I supposed to know there was an anime club?

666
00:43:52,437 --> 00:43:52,939
Scott: How would I?

667
00:43:53,059 --> 00:43:56,490
Scott: did you even think to type in like RIT anime into Google?

668
00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:01,550
Scott: Did you even think to look at the signs on the wall all over the fucking when I told that did you read any of the?

669
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:06,290
Scott: Documentation that the school gave you about clubs that guy didn't know fan subs existed?

670
00:44:06,832 --> 00:44:10,508
Scott: Yeah, I didn't either when I got to alright, but he's super into anime.

671
00:44:10,589 --> 00:44:16,004
Rym: Yep So, I think there's just a subset of people who don't connect regardless of internet or whatever.

672
00:44:16,044 --> 00:44:22,786
Rym: but because of so that was in 2002 or throws like a decade ago that we read ran into that situation.

673
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:34,230
Rym: because from that guy the eboard we started to recognize especially we started really going to anime conventions that There are people who went to Otakon the biggest anime con who didn't know anime conventions were a thing.

674
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:38,163
Rym: They thought Otakon was the only one and they didn't think of it as an anime convention.

675
00:44:38,183 --> 00:44:40,050
Rym: They thought of it as an Otakon.

676
00:44:41,231 --> 00:44:44,404
Rym: And when at Otakon one time I was like to these people.

677
00:44:44,705 --> 00:44:47,074
Rym: Yeah, you guys ever go to Kazucon I'm like, they're like, what's that?

678
00:44:47,637 --> 00:44:48,801
Rym: Like it's another anime con.

679
00:44:48,841 --> 00:44:55,338
Rym: It's you know in DC the next time I was not far away and they were like There's more of these.

680
00:44:55,418 --> 00:44:57,750
Scott: Yeah, they have a fucking table in the dealers room.

681
00:44:57,810 --> 00:45:07,885
Scott: Did you not see them sitting there with their multi TV display saying hey guys come to our other Convention as you were right right there in the middle of the fucking dealers room.

682
00:45:07,945 --> 00:45:09,089
Scott: They were there yelling at you.

683
00:45:09,777 --> 00:45:10,589
Scott: How did you ask them?

684
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:13,338
Rym: There are some people who for whatever reason don't connect.

685
00:45:13,819 --> 00:45:18,795
Rym: in the decades since then when we identified this we used to call them Off-the-radar anime fans.

686
00:45:18,835 --> 00:45:20,841
Rym: people are super into anime didn't know.

687
00:45:20,901 --> 00:45:24,170
Rym: there were other people who into anime didn't know their conventions didn't know.

688
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:31,049
Rym: There were fan subs had no idea completely disconnected that we're seeing a huge divergence between two.

689
00:45:31,853 --> 00:45:44,150
Rym: Everything that has anything on the internet Which is everything at this point has two communities the connected community on the internet And then the Balkanized community, that's a hundred identical tiny communities.

690
00:45:44,916 --> 00:45:53,411
Rym: While they might have different local color They're effectively identical in that they all have the same 11 threads or the same 11 conversations or whatever This.

691
00:45:53,934 --> 00:46:00,143
Rym: but those all those Balkanized ones together are basically Disappearing from the world to people like me and Scott.

692
00:46:00,686 --> 00:46:04,818
Rym: they those people don't exist And we're diverging further and further and further.

693
00:46:04,838 --> 00:46:07,146
Scott: I think this is one other factor here.

694
00:46:07,427 --> 00:46:12,160
Scott: It's a potential factor I have no evidence for it, right I think that you know.

695
00:46:12,401 --> 00:46:18,010
Scott: we've talked to a lot of people like for example We met I was at doing an artist alley table at an Otakon one year.

696
00:46:18,272 --> 00:46:21,597
Scott: Oh, yeah, and this and I was like hey We do a podcast you doubt.

697
00:46:21,657 --> 00:46:24,630
Scott: and this girl basically said it she didn't have a computer and she kept walking.

698
00:46:25,394 --> 00:46:26,519
Scott: And I was like what the fuck?

699
00:46:26,961 --> 00:46:28,670
Scott: yeah, and it's they're into something.

700
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:33,042
Scott: Maybe they're into you know but their computer skills are just low.

701
00:46:33,504 --> 00:46:43,138
Scott: so even though they're into a thing They just don't have the technology skills to be connected, and if they figure one thing out It's like they're never gonna figure out anything else.

702
00:46:43,279 --> 00:46:43,399
Scott: right?

703
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:47,375
Scott: maybe they figure out how to get an email newsletter For like their model train.

704
00:46:47,696 --> 00:46:51,850
Rym: a lot of these people that I meet are super internet II or fortunate or something.

705
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:53,078
Scott: This is why I don't write.

706
00:46:53,259 --> 00:46:54,024
Scott: There's another thing.

707
00:46:54,084 --> 00:46:55,010
Scott: I think that happens.

708
00:46:55,853 --> 00:46:58,081
Scott: I think that some of these people had.

709
00:46:58,122 --> 00:47:00,330
Scott: they just are not good at reading.

710
00:47:00,952 --> 00:47:02,436
Scott: They're reading skills.

711
00:47:02,597 --> 00:47:05,365
Scott: even if their internet skills are high they know how to use internets.

712
00:47:05,686 --> 00:47:07,110
Scott: their reading skills are low.

713
00:47:07,352 --> 00:47:13,235
Scott: They cannot like I can blaze through So many web pages so fast.

714
00:47:13,335 --> 00:47:19,433
Scott: I can read like all the Kotaku's all the gaming blogs all the anime blogs in like 15 minutes it doesn't take.

715
00:47:19,513 --> 00:47:25,794
Scott: I do it multiple times a day over and over and over again, right I See some people.

716
00:47:25,914 --> 00:47:35,185
Scott: it would take them a while to like read a day's worth of Kotaku And quickly get all that gaming information and hold on to it long enough to matter you know.

717
00:47:35,225 --> 00:47:42,630
Scott: so if you don't have the high Reading skills it takes you so long to absorb information even if you were in all these communities.

718
00:47:42,853 --> 00:47:51,769
Scott: It's like the amount of time It would take you to catch up on all those threads and especially if you're not checking often like imagine if you read our forum once every two days.

719
00:47:52,531 --> 00:47:54,820
Scott: Right there are so many new posts.

720
00:47:55,422 --> 00:47:57,510
Scott: once every two days you open it up.

721
00:47:57,530 --> 00:47:58,418
Scott: There's a zillion on.

722
00:47:58,438 --> 00:47:59,789
Scott: you know new unread things.

723
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:05,088
Scott: how long would it take you to sit there and read through all of them and get all the information out of them?

724
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:13,629
Scott: and Doing it all at once is sort of But doing it a little bit at a time Reloading three or four times a day two or three posts at a time.

725
00:48:14,212 --> 00:48:16,501
Scott: You can actually absorb all these things now you know.

726
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:29,407
Scott: and if you aren't able to do that Then even if you're in the communities even if you have technical skills it becomes Daunting or impossible to absorb all the information unless that's what you do.

727
00:48:29,427 --> 00:48:30,350
Scott: That's what I do.

728
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:42,630
Scott: I have a mobile phone, and I'm sitting at a computer most of the day every day constantly absorbing information Most of the hours other than GeekNights, and then when I get home from GeekNights It's weird because there's a double pile of information.

729
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:43,232
Scott: I'm like whoa.

730
00:48:43,433 --> 00:48:45,199
Rym: a sealed room doesn't have enough oxygen.

731
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:48,848
Rym: modern buildings are so well sealed the co2 levels over the course of night can affect your brain.

732
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:55,452
Rym: Really for a single person to get ventilation a window has to be cracked one inch at an additional inch for each additional person in The room.

733
00:48:55,773 --> 00:48:57,180
Rym: the only reason no one realizes this?

734
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:01,996
Rym: because we don't have co2 detectors in our houses And he has a link at the bottom.

735
00:49:02,036 --> 00:49:05,369
Rym: It's been proving that the concept of a living wage is a liberal fantasy.

736
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:12,902
Rym: Throck Morton share Houston, Texas posted in 2007 and guys like that.

737
00:49:12,922 --> 00:49:20,790
Rym: he has posted Fifteen thousand two hundred and eighty-nine times in this forum and probably zero times in any other forum anywhere else ever.

738
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:24,664
Rym: I can't look at more details about him without logging into the Anantech forum.

739
00:49:24,724 --> 00:49:26,250
Scott: that guy just lives an antique.

740
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:26,973
Scott: That's his thing.

741
00:49:27,113 --> 00:49:28,137
Rym: He probably has nothing else.

742
00:49:28,478 --> 00:49:29,241
Rym: I'm trying to google him.

743
00:49:29,683 --> 00:49:30,004
Scott: You know.

744
00:49:30,084 --> 00:49:31,489
Rym: This is a case study right now.

745
00:49:32,033 --> 00:49:41,690
Scott: Yeah, I mean we're just guessing a lot about this But I really really really want to find some way to research and investigate And just find these people and figure out how they work.

746
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:46,570
Rym: I think there's a much more core level because I want the world to be connected.

747
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:56,310
Scott: There's people out there who like the same things I like and we could be best friends, but they're for whatever reason Not connected people and they could become connected people because I wasn't always connected.

748
00:49:56,892 --> 00:49:59,320
Scott: I would lived in an era when connecting like that wasn't even possible.

749
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,243
Rym: I was always connected.

750
00:50:00,283 --> 00:50:04,384
Rym: I had BBS's from very early age elementary school middle school.

751
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:06,856
Scott: There wasn't any connection school high school.

752
00:50:06,876 --> 00:50:12,534
Scott: There was not connections until like middle early middle middle middle school middle school I was on BBS's.

753
00:50:12,695 --> 00:50:14,380
Scott: Yeah, that was the time when we could connect.

754
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,949
Scott: so up until then connecting was not possible.

755
00:50:17,069 --> 00:50:25,079
Scott: Yeah So, you know and I see other people who are much older than me who weren't connected, but now we're very connected All right, so they spent they were.

756
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:43,490
Rym: there might be something more fundamental one thing I've noticed among the people who just don't connect stuff and don't ever seem to know anything about their things is that they're extremely Unmotivated and they might think like if you were talking to one of those people that that's not true, but in my conversations with them They even if they're super smart super cool

757
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:46,829
Scott: But they'll be super excited when you tell them the thing they don't know that they should know.

758
00:50:47,392 --> 00:50:51,410
Rym: But then they're immediately disinterested in any further details.

759
00:50:51,972 --> 00:50:55,823
Rym: Maybe like sometimes like oh the penny arcade expose a gaming convention.

760
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:56,786
Rym: Oh, really?

761
00:50:56,866 --> 00:50:58,934
Rym: Oh my god gaming conventions That sounds so awesome.

762
00:50:58,974 --> 00:50:59,817
Rym: Oh, she could go to one.

763
00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:11,201
Rym: and if you say any more details about packs, they don't give a shit Mmm, and it seems that there's a trend of when I talk to a person who's disconnected like this They very quickly lose interest in things.

764
00:51:11,241 --> 00:51:13,730
Rym: so maybe it has to do with attention span or motivation.

765
00:51:14,611 --> 00:51:24,240
Scott: That is one thing because I know I have this problem right where when I explain something I explain every fucking detail because sometimes to An annoying fault because you're explaining rules that don't matter to a game.

766
00:51:24,401 --> 00:51:27,530
Scott: But if someone's explaining something to me, it's a golden rule.

767
00:51:27,671 --> 00:51:29,260
Scott: I want to hear all those fucking details.

768
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,070
Scott: You can't leave shit out because I'll give you leave it out.

769
00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:31,876
Scott: I'm gonna grill you.

770
00:51:31,897 --> 00:51:33,610
Scott: I'm gonna be like, hey, wait a minute.

771
00:51:33,931 --> 00:51:37,443
Rym: What like when Pete tried to tell you the epic of Beowulf exactly.

772
00:51:37,463 --> 00:51:39,610
Rym: so wait, what was they will do with these guys?

773
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:42,096
Rym: Yeah, what what exactly?

774
00:51:42,116 --> 00:51:43,160
Scott: which king I need?

775
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:43,983
Scott: you just kill the king.

776
00:51:44,043 --> 00:51:46,874
Scott: That's why it's the same thing when I'm on the internet There's no one to ask.

777
00:51:47,115 --> 00:51:49,042
Scott: I click on all the links and read all the Wikipedia's.

778
00:51:49,102 --> 00:51:51,110
Scott: cuz I got to know all the inside bits.

779
00:51:51,232 --> 00:51:55,066
Scott: Even if I forget them I look them up and I remember at least some of them vaguely.

780
00:51:55,086 --> 00:52:00,590
Scott: and you know If I can if I ever come back to that, I'll come back to that, you know, and that's you know.

781
00:52:00,771 --> 00:52:03,270
Scott: Keep you know, it's like you can't remember lots of things.

782
00:52:03,491 --> 00:52:09,964
Scott: So just remember how to find things with Google and just keep refreshing the brain Constantly reading and looking and reading and looking all the time.

783
00:52:10,305 --> 00:52:13,781
Rym: now, I'm gonna make a vow I'm gonna say something that's almost a value judgment here.

784
00:52:13,801 --> 00:52:15,730
Scott: And this is why I always tell people I'm not smart.

785
00:52:16,152 --> 00:52:18,604
Scott: I just read lots of Wikipedia and repeat what I read.

786
00:52:18,845 --> 00:52:19,669
Rym: What was that xkcd?

787
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:27,342
Rym: It's like the realization people think I'm smart that you and another person are just quoting the Wikipedia article You both recently read back and forth at each other.

788
00:52:27,363 --> 00:52:28,369
Scott: That's exactly my life.

789
00:52:29,192 --> 00:52:33,145
Rym: So about to make kind of a value judgment, so I want to qualify this.

790
00:52:33,466 --> 00:52:34,570
Scott: I value judge away.

791
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:44,382
Rym: There are many people who don't appear to be connected but are but you simply wouldn't recognize it Because the things they're connected to like their connections don't overlap with yours.

792
00:52:44,563 --> 00:52:44,984
Rym: That's true.

793
00:52:45,125 --> 00:52:52,568
Rym: Like I know a lot of people who are Super tumblers and they have like this crazy network in that whole area, but I don't tumble that much.

794
00:52:52,608 --> 00:53:02,794
Rym: Yeah, but What I found is that when I talk to someone like that with whom I have Let's say very little if any shared interests It doesn't matter.

795
00:53:03,275 --> 00:53:08,310
Rym: we still communicate on a pretty high level because they're connected and I'm connected.

796
00:53:08,712 --> 00:53:12,469
Rym: So it's obvious that they're a connected person even if I cannot see any of their connections.

797
00:53:13,471 --> 00:53:18,127
Rym: Meanwhile the people I meet even though I have a huge overlap in interests who are not connected.

798
00:53:18,147 --> 00:53:28,170
Rym: It is obvious They're not connected because I can't find if I talk to the connected person who I don't have anything in common with Like I'll find all the connections like around the back of their head while we talk.

799
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:36,790
Scott: Yeah, it's like you read these tumblers and I read these Twitter's but you know There's gonna be a funny JPEGs that show up on both or Wikipedia's that we both link.

800
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:38,783
Rym: So it's like any something like they'll sign like.

801
00:53:38,864 --> 00:53:44,470
Rym: oh I read an article About X and I know suddenly about this whole branch that they've been exploring on the internet.

802
00:53:44,993 --> 00:53:54,390
Scott: The people who aren't connected like the under-the-radar gamer dudes Even if they love games RPGs and anime and comics they have everything in common with us.

803
00:53:55,013 --> 00:53:56,924
Rym: Right, there'll be no shared citations.

804
00:53:56,964 --> 00:54:02,610
Rym: They won't reference External things when I talk to them, they only ever reference their own anecdotes.

805
00:54:03,453 --> 00:54:05,382
Rym: Yeah, I mean when I'm connected never say to me.

806
00:54:05,543 --> 00:54:12,249
Rym: Oh, I just read an article about X. They say I just saw or did X I just played X. never I read a review about X.

807
00:54:12,289 --> 00:54:18,165
Scott: whenever Whenever you talk to someone who you've never met before right most of the conversation is my friend.

808
00:54:18,285 --> 00:54:19,910
Scott: this I saw this.

809
00:54:20,351 --> 00:54:22,900
Scott: I read this right and it's never.

810
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:24,104
Scott: you know, what I did?

811
00:54:24,124 --> 00:54:25,750
Scott: I said I sit around reading things all day.

812
00:54:26,035 --> 00:54:26,526
Scott: What did I do?

813
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:31,973
Rym: But I think you can tell how connected someone is by tracking, you know This is going back to our IT.

814
00:54:31,993 --> 00:54:33,959
Rym: when I took those communications classes one thing we did.

815
00:54:34,421 --> 00:54:50,598
Rym: we diagram conversations to figure out social dynamics so you'd listen to or you'd watch a video of like a board meeting and You'd set up a metric for depending on the kinds of sentences people said you could objectively determine things about who's in charge Who has who's the power broker?

816
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:51,682
Rym: Who's the beta?

817
00:54:51,743 --> 00:54:52,606
Rym: Who's the Omega?

818
00:54:52,626 --> 00:54:53,690
Rym: You know all those kinds of things?

819
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:56,638
Rym: I think there's a similar thing going on with these unconnected people.

820
00:54:57,099 --> 00:55:07,770
Rym: I think there's a correlation like people who make fewer Citations to things that are not anecdotal tend to be also the people who are very unconnected and unmotivated.

821
00:55:08,592 --> 00:55:09,539
Scott: Mm-hmm, it's possible.

822
00:55:09,922 --> 00:55:11,030
Rym: There's probably a much more.

823
00:55:11,752 --> 00:55:15,523
Scott: I mean really it's a thing we can tell it exists and we really can't tell why.

824
00:55:15,543 --> 00:55:18,792
Scott: and if we because there is the disconnected It's like we're.

825
00:55:18,872 --> 00:55:24,889
Scott: it's like we know that there's a tribe of people in the jungle and we know that they're.

826
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:27,672
Scott: you know They're undiscovered tribe in this jungle And we know.

827
00:55:27,692 --> 00:55:36,570
Scott: we know that they're there because we met someone who met them and one of them escaped once and we talked to Them a little bit, but we couldn't Because you didn't have a language in common.

828
00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:42,090
Rym: I have a better another there and let's guess about how they're out there as a much much better analogy.

829
00:55:42,635 --> 00:55:49,170
Rym: So we were you know We came out of the jungle into the big old wide world and connected with all the people who were out there.

830
00:55:49,691 --> 00:55:51,537
Rym: And then ten years ago at the RIT anime club.

831
00:55:51,778 --> 00:55:55,470
Rym: We found an isolated tribe the under-the-radar anime fans.

832
00:55:55,490 --> 00:55:57,449
Rym: We're like, whoa, look at these people.

833
00:55:58,170 --> 00:56:00,759
Rym: Yeah, we studied them and then we forgot about it.

834
00:56:01,402 --> 00:56:09,045
Rym: and then in our travels around the world for the next ten years We kept running into identical tribes in different places that were not connected to each other.

835
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:11,698
Rym: a Thousand tribes that are all the same.

836
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,230
Rym: None of them have any actual connection to each other.

837
00:56:14,571 --> 00:56:16,416
Rym: So it's connected on some human level.

838
00:56:16,777 --> 00:56:17,880
Rym: Meanwhile, we're connected.

839
00:56:18,021 --> 00:56:20,869
Rym: all of us connected people on this technology level.

840
00:56:22,492 --> 00:56:25,490
Rym: So the human people have like a base human connection.

841
00:56:25,751 --> 00:56:30,946
Rym: They start from the same point, but then they just don't go out beyond that for whatever reason.

842
00:56:30,966 --> 00:56:37,790
Rym: I Don't I don't really understand it, but we this is something that we and the crew talk about a lot.

843
00:56:38,032 --> 00:56:39,570
Rym: So I figured we'd talk about it on the show.

844
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:44,608
Scott: I guess one thing we can do right is that if you're listening to this you're at least connected in some way.

845
00:56:44,648 --> 00:56:45,893
Scott: you're listening To a podcast.

846
00:56:45,933 --> 00:56:46,535
Scott: that's pretty good.

847
00:56:46,555 --> 00:56:46,956
Rym: That's fine.

848
00:56:46,996 --> 00:56:48,240
Rym: Someone who's not right.

849
00:56:48,681 --> 00:56:51,350
Scott: There are things that you like in this world, right?

850
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:54,901
Scott: So here's our and if you're not super connected like we are here's our advice for you.

851
00:56:54,981 --> 00:56:55,563
Scott: Number one.

852
00:56:56,205 --> 00:57:20,970
Scott: You need to Google and find multiple places that are you know the that are into the things that you're into and Check them a lot and Really get attached and find people all over the world and near you and around you who are into the same things that you can Say up-to-date and learn about these things that you're into, you know They really follow them and you will enjoy these things so much more, you know in a deep way because you're nerdy like that

853
00:57:21,519 --> 00:57:21,600
Rym: and

854
00:57:21,702 --> 00:57:24,740
Scott: also You should read a lot.

855
00:57:26,372 --> 00:57:30,870
Scott: All right, don't be sitting there and just like, you know being a bum, you know not doing anything.

856
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:34,210
Scott: You should be constantly, you know, when you're sitting there doing nothing.

857
00:57:34,991 --> 00:57:42,030
Scott: You should instead be talking to people or reading and learning about the things that you're into or doing the things that you're into.

858
00:57:42,090 --> 00:57:49,419
Scott: Alright, and it's not like some or it's not like oh I spend all my day playing video games And I never have time to read gaming blogs.

859
00:57:49,459 --> 00:57:49,922
Scott: No, it's like no.

860
00:57:49,942 --> 00:57:51,409
Scott: you can sort of do both at the same time.

861
00:57:52,112 --> 00:57:56,850
Scott: You know, I'll be like playing NS and in between around open up a little browser read an article back to the NS.

862
00:57:57,234 --> 00:57:58,649
Scott: You know, you gotta be fast.

863
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:02,694
Scott: Try trying is good.

864
00:58:07,204 --> 00:58:09,750
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

865
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:14,550
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

866
00:58:14,851 --> 00:58:16,818
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row.

867
00:58:16,858 --> 00:58:19,869
Scott: crew calm for show notes discussion news and more.

868
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:27,550
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one but four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.
