Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:33,757
Rym: I Felt like I had to do the opener a little different because I realized last time we did a Wednesday show was early May.

8
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:43,479
Rym: It's late June and that show we basically just talked about anime everyone forgot about and kind of a ad-hoc crab people fashion.

9
00:00:45,182 --> 00:00:46,370
Scott: Well, I think we're gonna.

10
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,940
Scott: I think we're getting some show ideas.

11
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,240
Scott: So we're gonna have a period of time here where the the getting is good.

12
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:53,769
Rym: Getting is getting better before this.

13
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:58,043
Scott: I'm sure there'll be a doldrums after it, but for now It's goodening.

14
00:00:58,465 --> 00:00:59,669
Scott: We came up with a Monday show.

15
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:02,860
Rym: I did and actually we got a lot of Wednesday stuff to do.

16
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,433

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,340
Rym: Ah, but all the things you watched are fucking ass long show.

20
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,968
Scott: You don't have to watch them all you just watch.

21
00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:18,793
Scott: enough to do a show.

22
00:01:18,813 --> 00:01:20,140
Rym: I could do a show on fist of the North.

23
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:23,375
Scott: Yeah, we actually have never done a fist of the North Star show ever.

24
00:01:23,395 --> 00:01:24,360
Rym: I feel like we could do it.

25
00:01:24,581 --> 00:01:25,609
Rym: It might be time to do it.

26
00:01:26,213 --> 00:01:26,919
Scott: It's always time.

27
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:28,173
Rym: What?

28
00:01:30,607 --> 00:01:31,053
Rym: But yeah, it's.

29
00:01:31,276 --> 00:01:35,721
Rym: uh You know a lot of people are complaining not that you guys will care since no one listens to the show right as it comes Out.

30
00:01:35,741 --> 00:01:36,687
Rym: but it's warm today.

31
00:01:36,707 --> 00:01:40,646
Scott: It is it was not warm yesterday But it is warm today.

32
00:01:40,806 --> 00:01:42,953
Scott: weather underground if you don't know about this website.

33
00:01:43,073 --> 00:01:46,651
Scott: It has nothing to do with the hippies who bomb shit underground.

34
00:01:46,671 --> 00:01:46,917
Scott: calm.

35
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:53,340
Scott: They basically take data from civilian, and I don't know if they take data from other weather stations.

36
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:56,920
Scott: Take data from weather stations, and it's like a open-source weather website.

37
00:01:57,921 --> 00:02:00,095
Scott: According to this the weather where we are right now.

38
00:02:00,216 --> 00:02:08,348
Scott: It is currently 97.3 degrees Fahrenheit, and it says it feels like 105 in Celsius for you foreign peoples.

39
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,421
Scott: I'm clicking the Celsius which right because you can't do it in your head Can you?

40
00:02:11,501 --> 00:02:12,404
Scott: that's right.

41
00:02:12,564 --> 00:02:16,154
Scott: it is 36.3 and feels like 40. it is so awesome.

42
00:02:16,996 --> 00:02:18,319
Rym: I would like it to be a little warmer.

43
00:02:19,245 --> 00:02:20,675
Scott: Well I mean the thing is right.

44
00:02:20,695 --> 00:02:24,151
Scott: when I'm biking This is the tiniest bit of chilliness.

45
00:02:24,372 --> 00:02:27,978
Scott: if I'm if you're moving fast, but other than that It's warm.

46
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,429
Rym: Yeah, I'm pretty much taking this granted.

47
00:02:30,972 --> 00:02:37,100
Rym: to be fair the only time in my life I've ever not had air conditioning in my primary residence was when we were at RIT in Rochester.

48
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:40,270
Scott: Didn't really matter her air conditioning.

49
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:40,813
Scott: No we didn't.

50
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:42,500
Scott: I guess not how well.

51
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,948
Rym: Why would you think that we had air conditioning?

52
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:48,400
Rym: trying to remember we schemed about having air conditioning in the winter?

53
00:02:48,782 --> 00:02:52,277
Rym: Because it got dank we left the window open all the time.

54
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:56,764
Scott: anyway there is Is something.

55
00:02:57,065 --> 00:02:57,847
Rym: you got something to say.

56
00:02:57,867 --> 00:02:59,653
Rym: you got nothing I forgot.

57
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:01,960
Scott: so oh, I just gonna say the thing.

58
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,765
Scott: I've been the comment.

59
00:03:02,785 --> 00:03:05,359
Scott: I've been making all day repeatedly, which I won't make after today.

60
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:07,473
Scott: cuz No, cuz I'm not Rym.

61
00:03:07,614 --> 00:03:08,037
Scott: It's a long day.

62
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:14,206
Scott: I like how when you open the door to the outside and you if you closed your you already told me that yeah But I didn't tell you on the show.

63
00:03:14,226 --> 00:03:17,891
Rym: Uh you've already said that anecdote though I know you can't tell it to another.

64
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:22,197
Scott: I'm not gonna say it ever again But you've you already said it twice, but when you open the door to the outside.

65
00:03:22,257 --> 00:03:32,610
Scott: It feels like How's it feel I kind of want to bring some pizza outside just to kind of let it cook And then we could go cook an egg on the asphalt.

66
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,334
Rym: I've done that before.

67
00:03:33,655 --> 00:03:34,540
Scott: you need a magnifying glass.

68
00:03:34,641 --> 00:03:35,788
Scott: No, you don't need no.

69
00:03:35,828 --> 00:03:37,297
Rym: just cracking egg on the asphalt was hot enough.

70
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:37,740
Rym: It just cooks.

71
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:38,966
Scott: I don't think it's hot enough right now.

72
00:03:39,107 --> 00:03:40,534
Scott: also the egg would be mad dirty.

73
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,183
Rym: Yeah, but now you don't eat it You just cook it.

74
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:48,498
Scott: then you leave it there for someone to find me like what the thing is if you put on someone if you Clean a windshield off and use that then you'll be able to eat that.

75
00:03:50,545 --> 00:03:52,259
Rym: True a windshield or a hood of a car?

76
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,044
Scott: Yeah, hood of a car.

77
00:03:53,064 --> 00:03:59,618
Rym: cuz I was gonna say windshield probably not the hottest thing in the world It'd be pretty hot not as hot as the hood of the car anyway.

78
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,685
Rym: anyway Let's send this fascinating conversation.

79
00:04:01,745 --> 00:04:02,688
Scott: so car black car.

80
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:06,740
Rym: I went to see a cat in Paris with Emily at the Angelica.

81
00:04:06,983 --> 00:04:08,079
Scott: I went all the way to Paris.

82
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:11,430
Rym: Yeah, there were commas in that sentence.

83
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:11,792
Scott: how many.

84
00:04:11,812 --> 00:04:13,420
Scott: I didn't mean there must be a lot of cats in Paris.

85
00:04:14,281 --> 00:04:20,640
Rym: There's just one apparently okay, and there were some some other cats in the opening bit, but no it's a French animation.

86
00:04:21,442 --> 00:04:22,125
Rym: What was interesting?

87
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:31,018
Rym: I saw the dub, and it was dubbed by none other than our friend Sinter Nicklaus Okay, and the main character was played by none other than mr.. Bloom.

88
00:04:31,962 --> 00:04:33,269
Rym: Uh-huh Spike Spiegel.

89
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,400
Rym: all right the dub was fine.

90
00:04:35,661 --> 00:04:41,680
Rym: I don't know how it compares to the sub though because I've never seen the sub, but yeah to geek bite it It is a fantastic movie.

91
00:04:42,842 --> 00:04:44,510
Rym: You should just go see it however you can.

92
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,660
Scott: apparently it has the opposite of the Wonder Woman problem.

93
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,380
Scott: I haven't seen it, but Rym says it has the opposite of the Wonder Woman.

94
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,759
Rym: Yes, we look at a movie post like the movie poster.

95
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,920
Rym: It looks like some amazing like different kind of animation with particular style.

96
00:04:56,281 --> 00:04:59,493
Rym: It looks exactly like that poster the whole time.

97
00:04:59,553 --> 00:05:00,356
Scott: That's amazing.

98
00:05:00,737 --> 00:05:05,380
Rym: It's all like Super flat not super flat, but it's just really flat.

99
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,423
Rym: There's like no depth Perspective.

100
00:05:07,463 --> 00:05:08,366
Scott: that really that you know.

101
00:05:08,406 --> 00:05:12,140
Scott: looking at the poster and knowing that it looks like the poster makes me want to see it.

102
00:05:12,381 --> 00:05:15,680
Rym: It's pretty good, and I don't really want to say anything else about it.

103
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,226
Rym: So consider this geek bite to be.

104
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:20,300
Rym: go see this movie or get it however you can.

105
00:05:20,682 --> 00:05:22,090
Scott: Is it an anime or is it French?

106
00:05:22,171 --> 00:05:23,780
Rym: it's a French animated movie?

107
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,664
Scott: What's it about?

108
00:05:24,684 --> 00:05:27,520
Scott: at least about a cat in Paris and a plot summer?

109
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,487
Rym: I don't want to summarize it because I went into it not knowing what it was about and it starts out You're like all right.

110
00:05:32,528 --> 00:05:33,115
Rym: There's the cat.

111
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:38,134
Rym: All right cats pretty cool, and then that's what is the central conflict.

112
00:05:38,154 --> 00:05:45,560
Rym: revolve around I hope Jewel thieves and a crazy guy and a murderer and some cops and the.

113
00:05:47,524 --> 00:05:48,991
Scott: So now we have a better idea, that's good.

114
00:05:49,252 --> 00:05:51,000
Rym: It's better going into it not really knowing.

115
00:05:51,261 --> 00:05:56,720
Rym: All I got to say is when you see the gigantic Giants penis You'll know that you're in fact in the right movie.

116
00:05:57,162 --> 00:06:01,180
Rym: There is a villain the villains described early on as a raving lunatic.

117
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:08,540
Rym: Yes, and when you meet him he is a raving lunatic like to a degree it was Chekhov's lunatism.

118
00:06:10,883 --> 00:06:14,417
Rym: All right, so we would have reviewed it, but Scott couldn't even pirate it.

119
00:06:14,497 --> 00:06:15,220
Rym: so we got there.

120
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:27,956
Scott: It was very is possible theoretically But yet difficult to get a subtitled or version because like people are like oh download the French version here and get the subtitle file And I'm like yeah fuck that noise.

121
00:06:27,976 --> 00:06:39,965
Scott: It's like yo 1997 digital fan subs call yeah, so if somebody out there wants to go through this trouble and go through all these sketchy websites one Website I went to was like here download the whole thing, and I'm like okay Don't move dot exe.

122
00:06:40,045 --> 00:06:43,860
Scott: right it was like blah blah blah dot exe, and I'm like I'm not stupid.

123
00:06:44,942 --> 00:06:57,838
Scott: So if anyone else wants to get viruses and somehow put together a non virus File with some English subtitles built in that are properly synced and such Put that on the Pirate Bay, but if not I'll just wait to watch this somehow.

124
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,507
Rym: otherwise Yeah, it was a good movie.

125
00:06:59,527 --> 00:07:04,651
Rym: That was it was refreshing because for me This was pretty good, but I went out of the theater like all right.

126
00:07:05,353 --> 00:07:10,320
Rym: I went out of the theater here like oh, yeah So there's not really much news in the anime.

127
00:07:12,524 --> 00:07:18,513
Scott: I mean, I guess Otakon coming up Whatever, so um I haven't done Scott's box in forever.

128
00:07:19,075 --> 00:07:20,300
Scott: Just cuz I sort of stopped doing that.

129
00:07:20,401 --> 00:07:23,324
Scott: I'm gonna maybe bring it back with increased production But who knows what?

130
00:07:23,384 --> 00:07:26,000
Scott: but so I figure hey is a way to cop out of a news.

131
00:07:26,462 --> 00:07:33,258
Scott: I'll just quickly go down the list not of what I've received But what I just ordered today because I sent in my order form today all right now from DCVs.

132
00:07:33,781 --> 00:07:38,920
Scott: Yeah, so now you will know what to order, but in particular one of these items is going to be my news.

133
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,750
Scott: So I'm gonna hold that one for the last item ready.

134
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:41,092
Scott: see is the.

135
00:07:41,152 --> 00:07:42,580

Scott: Manoka Magica the manga volume 2.

140
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:57,680
Rym: now that manga is written from the anime writer vice has no idea.

141
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,167
Scott: That's why I'm ordering it to find out.

142
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,318
Rym: I can probably find out anyway.

143
00:08:01,378 --> 00:08:02,685
Scott: go on I'm gonna check it out anyway.

144
00:08:02,725 --> 00:08:03,127

Scott: I sell to book off.

146
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,860
Rym: Yeah, you might say worst case.

147
00:08:06,222 --> 00:08:09,659
Rym: I read a volume of the escaflowne manga.

148
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,465
Scott: How can you spell it?

Scott: if you don't know right when you buy Marvel comics They they have lots of different kinds of trades, but pretty much this regular trades, which is a recent comic.

180
00:09:49,413 --> 00:09:51,260
Rym: are there Green Lanterns in it?

181
00:09:51,481 --> 00:09:55,657

00:09:55,677 --> 00:09:58,713
Scott: yeah That's why I'm checking it out because it's uber famous.

183

Scott: That's right.

00:17:28,861 --> 00:17:31,980
Scott: But in addition to I think you go to the website not that you go there.

310
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:40,889
Scott: But I just added because now that the websites updated I can update it a lot in small increments I added the video section of the website And you're probably thinking why don't you go the website?

311
00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:42,055
Scott: video section of the website.

312
00:17:42,176 --> 00:17:43,000
Scott: I can just go to the YouTube.

313
00:17:43,467 --> 00:17:44,340
Scott: You're absolutely correct.

314
00:17:44,421 --> 00:17:45,396
Scott: You can't just go to the you.

315
00:17:45,436 --> 00:17:52,534
Rym: yes But the videos on the website have collected for now a bunch of videos from other YouTube accounts You might not have known about.

316
00:17:52,554 --> 00:17:59,099
Scott: yeah And basically you can just come to the website and you'll find all of our relevant GeekNights related YouTube videos.

317
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:03,200
Scott: also I'm gonna add some RSS to those videos which that doesn't have them right now.

318
00:18:03,341 --> 00:18:05,919
Scott: So that'll make it even easier to say subscribe to our video.

319
00:18:06,823 --> 00:18:12,544
Rym: It might also let you realize you know a lot of people don't seem to real that a lot of our panels and things are On YouTube.

320
00:18:12,644 --> 00:18:19,220
Rym: yep like if you want to see that famous beyond Dungeons & Dragons Panel or the one where we said World of Warcraft sucks for half hour.

321
00:18:20,243 --> 00:18:21,160
Rym: They're all up there.

322
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,630
Rym: You can just watch the entire thing in glorious HD.

323
00:18:23,831 --> 00:18:32,840
Scott: also now when we post a new video to the website It'll automatically get tweeted Facebook Etc the same way as everything else and you might have noticed we're doing a Google+ hangout of every episode too.

324
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:40,667
Rym: So there's video of us actually like on the site, and you get to see like you know we do the show But you get to see what happens before the show.

325
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:42,775
Rym: after the show what we say about.

326
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,240
Scott: you're giving people the finger on the web.

327
00:18:44,462 --> 00:18:46,599
Rym: I'm not giving anyone the finger, okay?

328
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:57,528
Scott: Also, I want to remind people the new website since it was upgraded right has added a very powerful feature that people do not know About which is wiki show notes.

329
00:18:57,608 --> 00:19:00,598
Scott: you can write show notes for GeekNights episodes if you want.

330
00:19:00,658 --> 00:19:06,700
Scott: the way it works Is this I could have done a standard wiki, but the problem with standard wikis is spam spam.

331
00:19:07,741 --> 00:19:10,809
Scott: So here's how it works on my github account.

332
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:14,017
Scott: There is an FRC show notes public repository.

333
00:19:14,177 --> 00:19:17,451
Scott: if you fork that You can then in you create.

334
00:19:17,471 --> 00:19:18,840
Scott: there's a text file per episode.

335
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:33,406
Scott: You just have to create a text file in the correct folder with the correct name and in that text file you put the show Notes and you can put any text you want in there And then you send me a pull request and if I accept that pull request your show notes will then immediately Appear on front row.

336
00:19:33,426 --> 00:19:35,940
Scott: crew comm on the page for that episode.

337
00:19:36,484 --> 00:19:41,769
Scott: It's a pretty crazy system where all the show notes are on github But it totally works because I can do stuff like that now.

338
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:46,967
Rym: if we started this before we had like a thousand existing episodes I know, but we didn't.

339
00:19:47,007 --> 00:19:50,020
Scott: github didn't exist and I wasn't smart enough to think of that clever idea.

340
00:19:52,243 --> 00:19:56,080
Scott: But now it does and you can learn get you know, and it really isn't that hard.

341
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,851
Scott: You can actually do the whole thing from github.com.

342
00:19:58,872 --> 00:19:59,514
Scott: You don't need to okay.

343
00:19:59,534 --> 00:20:00,699
Rym: We don't have a thousand episodes.

344
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:02,771
Rym: We have 830 episodes.

345
00:20:03,014 --> 00:20:03,379
Scott: good job.

346
00:20:04,441 --> 00:20:09,360
Scott: Some of the episodes because somebody went there was a guy who was writing show notes and putting them in our forum.

347
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,091
Scott: Somebody went through and copy pasted all those show notes to github.

348
00:20:12,613 --> 00:20:14,119
Scott: So good job on that guy.

349
00:20:14,642 --> 00:20:18,060
Scott: Whoever did that and so there's already some episodes of show notes.

350
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,115
Scott: So you should go and help out on this if you are interested or not.

351
00:20:21,176 --> 00:20:22,000
Scott: Why do you work for free?

352
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,111
Rym: Yeah, but you know one one request we've gotten.

353
00:20:25,151 --> 00:20:27,180
Rym: I mean, you know, we never really read emails on the show.

354
00:20:27,562 --> 00:20:35,576
Rym: In fact, we tried to always avoid even talking about the meta of the show Until we made this like one meta moment like this specific place where we talk about that crap.

355
00:20:35,697 --> 00:20:40,539
Rym: Yep, so The biggest request we pretty much get other than hey Will you come to my tiny?

356
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:46,960
Rym: Convention is people who are for whatever reason fans of this and they want to get more involved in the GeekNights community.

357
00:20:47,462 --> 00:20:49,048
Rym: And you know what little there is.

358
00:20:49,088 --> 00:20:49,972
Rym: there's actually a lot.

359
00:20:49,992 --> 00:20:51,819
Rym: It's just all in the front recruit forum, right?

360
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,240
Rym: So you can get more ways to get involved.

361
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,440
Rym: You don't want to go into that scary forum where everyone yells at you about grammar, right?

362
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,500
Scott: You can contribute to the show notes by going to github.

363
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,320
Rym: If you have it some sort of like vested political angle, you can get your angle into those show notes.

364
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,269
Rym: We're not really gonna like curate them too.

365
00:21:08,289 --> 00:21:10,700
Scott: Well, I mean they have to be accepted by me as a pull request.

366
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:13,600
Scott: So it's basically it's pretty much gonna be a thumbs up or thumbs down situation.

367
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,262
Rym: Yeah, but if you're.

368
00:21:14,363 --> 00:21:18,217
Rym: if you're like Scott was wrong or Rym sucked in this episode, we're gonna let that in.

369
00:21:18,257 --> 00:21:18,699
Rym: we're really.

370
00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:25,120
Rym: I Think we're gonna Scott's gonna disprove if it's like the word penis eight hundred times in a row with no other content.

371
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:32,245
Scott: Notice I said with no other as long as it's actually show notes and not just you know links to Viagra Right.

372
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:37,800
Rym: Anyway, anyway Otherwise, you know, like I said for the other thing the other of course we get is convention.

373
00:21:38,021 --> 00:21:49,720
Rym: so seriously, if you want us to come to a convention if You are not the person who runs that convention Don't tell us to go to the convention at least like the panels or the guest department.

374
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:53,057
Rym: We're not gonna go to the convention to say hey, can we come?

375
00:21:53,097 --> 00:21:53,480
Rym: it's got it.

376
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,364
Rym: It's the other way around.

377
00:21:54,404 --> 00:21:57,560
Scott: you have to tell the convention to ask us to come right?

378
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,159
Scott: You're just a convention goer.

379
00:21:59,461 --> 00:22:00,768
Scott: Don't ask us to go to the con.

380
00:22:00,828 --> 00:22:02,256
Scott: ask the con to bring us there.

381
00:22:02,336 --> 00:22:06,152
Rym: cuz I've had like three Situations recently where someone emailed me like hey would you like to come to ex-con?

382
00:22:06,594 --> 00:22:09,206
Rym: and I always send my standard response of yeah You know, it's far away.

383
00:22:09,266 --> 00:22:11,600
Rym: So we need you know X Y & Z and then yeah, we'll come.

384
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,404
Rym: What do you want us to do?

385
00:22:12,805 --> 00:22:15,840
Rym: and then they're like, oh, I just wanted you to submit a panel.

386
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,344
Rym: Yeah to this con.

387

Rym: Well, the con has to call us if it's not on our list of cars.

390
00:22:24,013 --> 00:22:25,360
Rym: We already go to like packs.

391
00:22:26,202 --> 00:22:26,478
Scott: exactly.

392
00:22:27,381 --> 00:22:32,900
Rym: There's a very we have a short list of cons that we will go to even if we aren't doing any GeekNights crap at them.

393
00:22:33,141 --> 00:22:33,907
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

394
00:22:33,968 --> 00:22:35,500
Rym: packs and packs and mag fest.

395
00:22:36,302 --> 00:22:37,996
Scott: If you want to bring me to Essen I'll go.

396
00:22:38,016 --> 00:22:38,319
Scott: yeah.

397
00:22:38,621 --> 00:22:39,967
Scott: Yeah, all right.

398
00:22:40,389 --> 00:22:40,731
Scott: All right.

399
00:22:41,133 --> 00:22:44,952
Rym: So, uh, we've actually Despite not doing a lot of anime shows.

400
00:22:45,013 --> 00:22:46,480
Rym: We've been watching a lot of anime lately.

401
00:22:46,761 --> 00:22:49,132
Scott: I haven't been watching a lot, but there are three shows.

402
00:22:49,152 --> 00:22:56,474
Scott: We watched quite a few episodes of The new Lupin but of course, but I haven't watched that in a while and we can't really.

403
00:22:56,494 --> 00:22:58,260
Scott: I've watched like seven or eight episodes.

404
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,645
Scott: I just yeah, then I haven't.

405
00:22:59,665 --> 00:23:02,937
Rym: we can't review it until we finish it because for all we know it sucks.

406
00:23:03,037 --> 00:23:05,386
Scott: after the last episode We already did a show on it.

407
00:23:05,406 --> 00:23:08,197
Rym:  yeah, well, we'll do a real review once it's done.

408
00:23:08,358 --> 00:23:11,209
Rym: of course I've been watching polar bears cafe.

409
00:23:11,229 --> 00:23:13,780
Rym: Yeah, because my tool told me to watch one episode.

410
00:23:14,121 --> 00:23:20,367
Rym: Yeah, I saw one tweet about it and he and he and I was like what polar bear cafe I wonder if that's literally.

411
00:23:20,427 --> 00:23:29,253
Rym: and then the next tweet from him was like, yeah, it's really just a polar bear and Kids on the slope, which uh, pretty good.

412
00:23:29,313 --> 00:23:35,713
Scott: I watched seven or eight episodes And folk tales from Japan, which is two episodes.

413
00:23:35,793 --> 00:23:36,496
Scott: Oh my god.

414
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:38,864
Scott: Oh my god Why don't we talk about that first?

415
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:39,426
Scott: cuz I'm again?

416
00:23:39,486 --> 00:23:48,300
Rym: Okay, so folk tales from Japan is one of those short shows But instead of being short episodes, it's a full-length episode that has three short parts.

417
00:23:48,521 --> 00:23:52,780
Rym: Yeah, but otherwise like I think I'm adding it to our bite-sized anime panel.

418
00:23:53,201 --> 00:24:00,764
Scott: First of all, this show right is so cute with its drawing and the drawing style is pretty different depending on the legend being told Right.

419
00:24:00,784 --> 00:24:03,824
Scott: So I mean it's like It's just I don't know.

420
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:08,260
Scott: It's just so cute and the animation is so cute and it's it's really simple like they're saving money.

421
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,560
Scott: It's obviously not a big-budget.

422
00:24:10,341 --> 00:24:17,928
Scott: It's got two narrators who basically tell you the story the kind of thing like when you were a kid you would have to see On PBS or maybe not even PBS.

423
00:24:17,988 --> 00:24:21,399
Scott: maybe like you could see it like at the library, you know.

424
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,666
Scott: But you could never.

425
00:24:22,807 --> 00:24:24,922
Scott: you know, it doesn't seem like it's a real TV show But it is.

426
00:24:24,942 --> 00:24:28,420
Rym: it's the kind of thing that you'd like when you had a substitute teacher in elementary school.

427
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,564
Rym: They'd show you something like that.

428
00:24:29,604 --> 00:24:36,126
Scott: Yeah, so I'm like old fairy tale and as a narrator and You know the characters.

429
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:39,720
Scott: the characters don't really talk that much and everything's very simple.

430
00:24:40,142 --> 00:24:46,714
Scott: But despite all that it's like, you know, then the budget being low The production is not low as you know.

431
00:24:46,754 --> 00:24:53,352
Scott: to go with the budget being low Even though it's simple and cute and there isn't a lot of animation going on You don't need that much to tell these stories and what they do.

432
00:24:53,452 --> 00:24:55,060
Scott: everything they put into it is so great.

433
00:24:55,441 --> 00:24:57,468
Scott: It's like every animal is cute.

434
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:58,993
Scott: they move, you know.

435
00:24:59,113 --> 00:25:01,220
Scott: enough to be awesome is a cute.

436
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:06,622
Rym: Well, I think really the strength of it is that you know being not Japanese Like.

437
00:25:06,702 --> 00:25:12,719
Rym: I know the kind of like really big Japanese folk tales kind of like how people around the world know a lot of the big American folk tales.

438
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:20,866
Rym: There's like a a collected set of folk tales and legends that most people know about but I don't really expect someone in Japan to Know about Johnny Appleseed or Paul Bunyan?

439
00:25:20,906 --> 00:25:24,057
Rym: necessarily exactly granted Paul Bunyan might be more well-known now.

440
00:25:24,097 --> 00:25:24,317
Rym: Thanks.

441
00:25:24,378 --> 00:25:24,598
Rym: Dr.

442
00:25:24,618 --> 00:25:24,819
Rym: McNinja.

443
00:25:25,562 --> 00:25:26,045
Scott: I don't think Dr.

444
00:25:26,065 --> 00:25:28,458
Scott: McNinja is that popular in Japan, although he should be.

445
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:33,855
Rym: But you know beyond like Momotaro and a certain like set of Japanese folk tales.

446
00:25:33,915 --> 00:25:35,200
Rym: I don't know most of these stories.

447
00:25:35,263 --> 00:25:37,545
Scott: No kidding Cuz he didn't grow up as elementary school kids in Japan.

448
00:25:37,586 --> 00:25:44,166
Rym: And Japanese folk tales have a pretty different lilt from the folk tales I'm used to from when I was a kid.

449
00:25:44,186 --> 00:25:46,294
Scott: So pretty much all of them are the same, right?

450
00:25:46,354 --> 00:25:47,980
Rym: There's someone who does something good.

451
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,413
Scott: Okay, wait, here are the common trends in all of these folk tales from.

452
00:25:51,473 --> 00:25:52,517
Scott: I've watched two episodes so far.

453
00:25:52,537 --> 00:25:53,400
Rym: Should we tell them the trends?

454
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,924
Rym: Let's just tell them the lessons you should learn.

455
00:25:54,945 --> 00:25:55,948
Scott: I hear the trends, ready?

456
00:25:55,988 --> 00:26:02,547
Scott: Number one, the honest person always gets gold as like a rewards and the nosy neighbor gets fucked.

457
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:08,500
Scott: The lying, cheating, stealing, evil person gets some horrible punishment like poop in the face But it's always pretty specific.

458
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:11,190
Rym: It's something good happens to someone because they're a good person.

459
00:26:11,732 --> 00:26:15,204
Rym: then a neighbor comes into the house and says oh my god where'd you get all that gold?

460
00:26:15,224 --> 00:26:24,098
Rym: and then they hear the story and they go try to do the exact same thing all evil like and Get horse poop in the face or killed or something, right?

461
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,137
Scott: So if your friend got rich playing the stock market do not play the stock market.

462
00:26:29,197 --> 00:26:29,940
Scott: That is the lesson.

463
00:26:30,562 --> 00:26:32,509
Scott: No, I think your friends got rich betting on horses.

464
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:33,352
Scott: Don't bet on horses.

465
00:26:33,372 --> 00:26:35,680
Rym: Don't be a noisy neighbor or a nosy neighbor.

466
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,687
Scott: Yeah, don't be a greedy.

467
00:26:36,748 --> 00:26:38,460
Rym: right neighbors alone, you know?

468
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:46,465
Rym: Oh more importantly if there's a magical artifact and someone tells you not to do something Do not fucking do it.

469
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,753
Scott: Any magical instructions from any supernatural source.

470
00:26:49,813 --> 00:26:56,606
Scott: if a Buddha or an animal or a Goddess or a princess tells you to do something Follow those instructions.

471
00:26:56,706 --> 00:27:01,380
Scott: and also the bad people are going to specifically not follow those instructions and they'll be punished for it.

472
00:27:01,681 --> 00:27:03,628
Scott: And if you follow the instructions, you'll be rewarded for it.

473
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:08,899
Rym: Unless the instructions come from someone who is obviously bad Then you're rewarded for not doing it.

474
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:13,540
Scott: Yes, it's obvious to be able to tell what the good instructions are and what the bad instructions are.

475
00:27:14,142 --> 00:27:16,850
Rym: I think my favorite ones are.

476
00:27:16,991 --> 00:27:19,980
Rym: I really like the one about the man the old men with the bumps.

477
00:27:20,524 --> 00:27:21,291
Rym: You didn't see that one.

478
00:27:21,351 --> 00:27:22,340
Rym: No, there's one guy with.

479
00:27:23,421 --> 00:27:24,465
Scott: There's any animals.

480
00:27:24,505 --> 00:27:27,236
Scott: just be nice to all animals and you'll be rewarded.

481
00:27:27,376 --> 00:27:30,663
Rym: Yep turtles Doggies boxes.

482
00:27:30,704 --> 00:27:32,611
Rym: Well, there's the trickster Fox, but he got his.

483
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,558
Scott: yeah fishies anything.

484
00:27:34,598 --> 00:27:35,080
Scott: That's nice.

485
00:27:35,201 --> 00:27:38,360
Scott: You should be nice to it and you will be rewarded for being nice to animals.

486
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:48,723
Scott: All right You get to hang out with hot Mermaid princess in her palace under the sea for all eternity or you're a dumbass and you leave to go back to the real Stupid world.

487
00:27:48,763 --> 00:27:49,004
Rym: Yeah.

488
00:27:49,164 --> 00:27:50,911
Scott: Yeah, that's another lesson.

489
00:27:50,951 --> 00:27:53,731
Scott: if you got it good if you're in paradise, don't leave That's right.

490
00:27:54,201 --> 00:27:58,262
Rym: If you got the reward if you think I should really go out and see my family now That's.

491
00:27:58,303 --> 00:28:01,400
Scott: that is one thing I noticed right in an American folktale, right?

492
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:08,408
Scott: You would or a fairy tale you would often see a situation where someone get a reward and say no I don't need the reward because I'm such a good person.

493
00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:11,580
Scott: Yep, and this it's like I got rewarded with gold.

494
00:28:12,102 --> 00:28:13,046
Scott: Enjoy the gold.

495
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:16,040
Scott: like there's one greedy looking for more gold, right?

496
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:21,160
Scott: You got the gold in or reward usually gold because you were sometimes fancy cloth, right?

497
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,118
Scott: Because you were genuinely nice and honest and you got rewarded for it.

498
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:29,560
Scott: Don't go greedy looking for more rewards because that make turns you to the bad person.

499
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:35,260
Scott: You'll lose the reward but and don't go just trying to be honest or you know on purpose to get rewards.

500
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,600
Rym: But if you got a reward those monkeys carry that guy away and gave him gold.

501
00:28:39,582 --> 00:28:43,773
Scott: If you got an honest reward, just enjoy that reward.

502
00:28:43,793 --> 00:28:46,520
Scott: All right, don't go giving it up or anything like that.

503
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,779
Scott: Just enjoy it because otherwise no good.

504
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:50,024
Rym: but also like what?

505
00:28:50,044 --> 00:28:50,184
Rym: like?

506
00:28:50,225 --> 00:28:56,188
Rym: I think the most interesting one for that because I didn't expect the outcome that happened was the guy had The dream about the treasure.

507
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:58,119
Rym: the other guys like let me buy your dream from you.

508
00:28:58,681 --> 00:29:09,200
Rym: Oh, yeah, and then he goes to try to find that treasure and I thought the moral was gonna be the guy who sold him The dream was just smart and basically got some free money out of him because the other guy was an idiot.

509
00:29:09,744 --> 00:29:10,913
Rym: But then there was really gold.

510
00:29:11,336 --> 00:29:18,798
Scott: Yeah, so He was honest for buying the dream and then the guy who owned the land that had the treasure split it within 50/50 Which is sort of like.

511
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:35,840
Rym: But seriously if you're evil or a bad neighbor or a nosy neighbor and you think you're gonna get a bunch of gold Because you're gonna do this plot don't burn all your clothes before your husband comes back with the gold.

512
00:29:36,221 --> 00:29:38,089
Rym: Yeah, he's not coming back with the gold.

513
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:43,350
Scott: This really makes me wonder like how Japanese culture like neighbors are viewed.

514
00:29:43,371 --> 00:29:54,651
Scott: right because the only Japanese like I mean I only really know every neighbor in these is a day The only anime or manga I can think of where there's neighbors that are like, you know Good and friendly is Yotsuba right?

515
00:29:54,691 --> 00:29:56,018
Scott: Yotsuba has awesome neighbors.

516
00:29:56,486 --> 00:29:59,163
Rym: Oh Here's Greenwood.

517
00:29:59,183 --> 00:30:01,531
Rym: The neighbors are awesome, but they're not good neighbors.

518
00:30:01,571 --> 00:30:03,980
Rym: What neighbors are there in the other rooms in the dog?

519
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,128
Scott: Oh, that's dorm mates.

520
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:07,143
Scott: That's not the same as not the same I'm talking about.

521
00:30:07,163 --> 00:30:11,560
Scott: you're in a house and the people who live in the neighboring house the house next to it.

522
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,292
Rym: Usually those people don't exist in anime.

523
00:30:13,332 --> 00:30:14,319
Scott: That's what I'm talking about.

524
00:30:14,701 --> 00:30:16,347
Scott: Right, but in a lot of u.s.

525
00:30:16,508 --> 00:30:23,151
Scott: Culture right neighbors happen a lot Dennis the Menace neighbors And it's always bad.

526
00:30:23,171 --> 00:30:27,754
Scott: So Steve Urkel man, right, but that's what I'm saying.

527
00:30:27,774 --> 00:30:29,100
Rym: Is that wait in both Japan in the u.s.

528
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:32,310
Rym: If there's a neighbor in a story they are bad mr.

529
00:30:32,351 --> 00:30:35,130
Rym: Rogers He was his neighborhood though.

530
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:40,500
Scott: Maybe all his Sesame Street And you know, we have good and bad neighbors in a lot, right?

531
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:54,685
Scott: It seems that neighbors at least in animes among us I have read one show that we're following that out, right the animes and mangas that I have read are rare and in my exposure To their folk tales their neighbors are frequent but always evil Really evil.

532
00:30:55,006 --> 00:30:59,400
Rym: one of them was evil greedy one guy who's a dog greedy and mischievous and annoying.

533
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,088
Rym: They're greedy and usually kind of dumb and nosy.

534
00:31:02,108 --> 00:31:02,529
Scott: All right.

535
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:06,697
Rym: Yeah, and if you're ever in the mouse paradise don't pretend to be a cat That's right.

536
00:31:06,946 --> 00:31:10,529
Scott: So anyway This folktale show is totally awesome and you can learn.

537
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:17,170
Scott: not only you can not only laugh at these awesome folk tales and enjoy them But learn about folk tales from a foreign culture.

538
00:31:17,231 --> 00:31:19,740
Scott: I really want to see this show from other countries.

539
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:24,440
Scott: I want the Russian cute folktale show the Indian cute folktale show the African cute.

540
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,779
Scott: I want to see all the folk tales in the whole world like this.

541
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,284
Rym: They're probably our shows.

542
00:31:28,324 --> 00:31:32,296
Scott: from all those Australian folktale show French folktale show hook me up.

543
00:31:32,316 --> 00:31:35,700
Scott: Yo, hook me up Give me a ball and it's on crunchyroll.

544
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,872
Scott: You can just watch all the episodes at least as they're coming.

545
00:31:37,912 --> 00:31:44,240
Rym: and if you watch it with Scott In the opening credit when it says what I'm always gonna point out the snake one of the animals moves.

546
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,530
Rym: It's gotta be like it was the snake.

547
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:47,574
Scott: It's pretty funny.

548
00:31:47,695 --> 00:31:48,840
Scott: Every episode is the same.

549
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,967
Scott: It's always snake then chicken then bunny.

550
00:31:51,168 --> 00:31:53,777
Scott: as the third one the snake chicken bunny snake is the best.

551
00:31:53,877 --> 00:31:55,987
Rym: Scott pays a lot of attention To this snake is the greatest.

552
00:31:56,108 --> 00:31:56,772
Rym: It's a pretty good show.

553
00:31:56,913 --> 00:31:57,557
Scott: It's a really good snake.

554
00:31:57,818 --> 00:32:02,497
Rym: So Before I knew what kids on the slope was about I knew it was about jazz.

555
00:32:02,557 --> 00:32:04,849
Scott: I knew is by Watanabe with you.

556
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:05,680
Scott: so that's the thing.

557
00:32:05,821 --> 00:32:14,760
Rym: All I heard was someone said there's a new Watanabe show coming out and yoko kano is doing the music and my brain said cowboy bebop.

558
00:32:15,981 --> 00:32:18,268
Scott: It's gonna be cowboy bebop or something like.

559
00:32:18,709 --> 00:32:21,738
Scott: I know it's gonna be heavily musical just like samurai champloo.

560
00:32:21,778 --> 00:32:22,460
Scott: and also the show.

561
00:32:23,401 --> 00:32:24,364
Rym: It's pretty good show.

562
00:32:24,544 --> 00:32:25,768
Rym: It's not like how we bebop though.

563
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:29,620
Scott: No, so I watched probably more episodes than Rym has right.

564
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:33,980
Rym: I think I've seen like four and I fell asleep during one because I just got back from a trip.

565
00:32:34,865 --> 00:32:37,700
Scott: So what I actually like about this show so far is number one.

566
00:32:37,781 --> 00:32:39,298
Scott: It's it's about jazz, right?

567
00:32:39,741 --> 00:32:45,180
Scott: But and it sort of leads you in this direction thinking it's gonna be typical anime tropes, right?

568
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,089
Scott: Transfer student is sort of the main focus.

569
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:57,160
Scott: character moves into town goes to school There's some bullies and some a girl and it's like I know where this goes same old same old.

570
00:32:57,382 --> 00:32:59,220
Scott: Oh, well the jazz music aspect.

571
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,172
Rym: I thought it was gonna do the the twist of.

572
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:06,114
Rym: it's the same old show But it has the kind of like getting you into it.

573
00:33:06,254 --> 00:33:07,840
Rym: anime about jazz, right?

574
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:12,245
Scott: So I thought it was gonna do that but it actually so far Hasn't done that.

575
00:33:12,286 --> 00:33:22,609
Scott: it's like the jazz is there but it's not doing a Hajime no Ippo Shonen jump sort of bakuman teach you everything But it does name drops You

576
00:33:22,651 --> 00:33:23,221
Rym: know You should

577
00:33:23,261 --> 00:33:36,440
Scott: know right and all it does is jazz is just the thing that is bringing these characters together and it's mostly about the characters, you know And you know their dramas and jazz just happens to be this thing in their lives.

578
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,449
Scott: That is like, you know the good awesome thing.

579
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,092
Scott: That is awesome.

580
00:33:39,173 --> 00:33:39,313
Rym: Yep.

581
00:33:39,675 --> 00:33:40,600
Rym: I like the show a lot.

582
00:33:41,122 --> 00:33:49,538
Scott: The reason I like it is because after you watch a few episodes, you can see that these characters Do not behave the way the anime character should behave.

583
00:33:49,578 --> 00:33:54,352
Scott: for example What is the typical anime character do when there's a girl avoid talking to her?

584
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:55,997
Scott: never right in this show?

585
00:33:56,077 --> 00:33:58,120
Scott: It's like hey What's up, right?

586
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,009
Scott: totally opposite of what anime characters do.

587
00:34:01,049 --> 00:34:06,940
Rym: there's a little anime is gonna hang over everyone's heads forever and Escalate and escalate and then be like a plot point here.

588
00:34:08,525 --> 00:34:12,940
Scott: They fight the bullies right away and then they're only there occasionally if at all, right.

589
00:34:14,282 --> 00:34:18,080
Scott: And it really sort of gets into like, you know this sort of and the plot moves, right?

590
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:26,694
Scott: It starts off for the school is a larger factor in the opening episodes because they're introducing the characters You know and it's like oh the bad guy sits in the back of class later episodes.

591
00:34:26,715 --> 00:34:49,105
Scott: You're not even seeing the classroom It's just not even there, you know, it's all this stuff outside the classroom and they keep bringing in, you know It's like they bring you up stuff that you think is gonna show up like at the end of the show Like oh his dad isn't around his dad is traveling military something like that You know, his mom is who knows where you know, it's like and you're like, oh, we'll learn the mystery of his family like Episode 26.

592
00:34:49,105 --> 00:34:52,580
Scott: It's like no, you don't learn the episode that his family's gonna show up right away.

593
00:34:53,062 --> 00:34:53,907
Scott: No mystery at all.

594
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,737
Scott: And it's like oh we know where mom is.

595
00:34:55,777 --> 00:34:56,260
Scott: Let's go see her.

596
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:02,180
Scott: Okay, you know and I really like that moving right along not cutting corners, you know progressing.

597
00:35:02,341 --> 00:35:07,460
Scott: But even as they progress and resolve these plots, they don't completely resolve them, right?

598
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,852
Scott: They move them and then the goalposts go farther out.

599
00:35:10,892 --> 00:35:14,402
Rym: So, you know what another show that did that was Nana Exactly.

600
00:35:14,442 --> 00:35:20,733
Rym: Nana was like alright here like I expect the plot to be the the thing about like meeting that guy again And then they get there right?

601
00:35:20,773 --> 00:35:21,440
Rym: They meet him again.

602
00:35:22,881 --> 00:35:24,265
Scott: It's almost just like Nana.

603
00:35:24,285 --> 00:35:24,706
Rym: You know what?

604
00:35:24,746 --> 00:35:25,749
Rym: I really like Nana.

605
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,535
Scott: It's a little less so poppery.

606
00:35:27,575 --> 00:35:27,756
Rym: Yeah.

607
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:32,428
Rym: Yeah Now what is both the strength and like?

608
00:35:32,469 --> 00:35:36,363
Rym: the worst thing I can say about the show is that it doesn't need to be Animated.

609
00:35:36,383 --> 00:35:42,932
Rym: I like it and I'm you know, I have no problem with it at all But it doesn't scratch that like crazy anime.

610
00:35:43,012 --> 00:35:43,594
Rym: It should just scratch.

611
00:35:43,614 --> 00:35:45,300
Rym: Well, I think it's a good show to watch it.

612
00:35:45,404 --> 00:35:46,564
Scott: Yeah I think this would be like.

613
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:53,053
Scott: you might as well be a manga anime wise because it's mostly people talking and not a lot of Action with the music, but you need the music.

614
00:35:53,073 --> 00:35:53,274
Scott: Yep.

615
00:35:53,515 --> 00:35:54,340
Scott: It's about jazz.

616
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,043
Scott: How do you know?

617
00:35:55,144 --> 00:35:57,796
Rym: it's the same reason why Nodabe Cantabile like the manga.

618
00:35:57,836 --> 00:35:58,620
Scott: it is a manga.

619
00:36:00,265 --> 00:36:00,846
Rym: But I didn't.

620
00:36:01,007 --> 00:36:03,595
Rym: I couldn't read that manga just was actually pretty boring.

621
00:36:03,615 --> 00:36:05,360
Rym: but then watching the show I loved every second of it.

622
00:36:07,223 --> 00:36:08,731
Scott: Is there anything else to say about it?

623
00:36:08,812 --> 00:36:09,234
Rym: Not really.

624
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:10,380
Rym: I mean, I don't want to spoil anything.

625
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,812
Rym: We're just saying it's a show you should watch.

626
00:36:11,853 --> 00:36:15,105
Scott: Yeah Negative thing about it.

627
00:36:15,165 --> 00:36:19,160
Scott: I would say that none of the characters are like super awesome, right?

628
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,154
Scott: Usually there's someone in a show that's like that's the awesomest dude.

629
00:36:22,195 --> 00:36:23,220
Rym: There's like one bunta.

630
00:36:23,503 --> 00:36:29,218
Scott: yeah, a bunta or You know Who's the guy in full metal alchemist who got killed?

631
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:33,165
Scott: Yeah, there's.

632
00:36:33,226 --> 00:36:35,920
Scott: no there is no one in the show who is like super awesome.

633
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:48,802
Scott: The main character is like he's got good parts and bad parts and he reminds me, you know, he reminds me It's almost too realistic and that every character has awesome parts and not awesome parts so that there's nobody you can really say like that's Some guy.

634
00:36:48,902 --> 00:36:49,804
Scott: I'm rooting for him all.

635
00:36:49,864 --> 00:36:59,271
Rym: the main character reminds me a little bit of aspects of both main characters from karikano Just a little bit like I thought he's got a blue.

636
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:00,735
Scott: He's got some jerkiness going on.

637
00:37:00,775 --> 00:37:02,080
Scott: That's not in karikano.

638
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,310
Rym: I just I found it interesting that watching the first few episodes.

639
00:37:04,391 --> 00:37:08,009
Rym: I thought of karikano a couple of times Just when characters did certain things.

640
00:37:08,169 --> 00:37:10,019
Rym: Yeah, that's the show ever forgot about.

641
00:37:11,841 --> 00:37:20,400
Scott: But anyway, yeah, there's no awesome people but it I guess maybe the dad who owns the jazz shop is awesome But you don't see him at all.

642
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,385
Scott: Right other than that he like he's barely in the frame and he says like maybe two lines He's very strict.

643
00:37:25,426 --> 00:37:25,969
Rym: we get that.

644
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,960
Rym: that's especially about the jazz, right?

645
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,869
Scott: You're not allowed to go in the basement unless you're jazzing.

646
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:31,391
Scott: That's right.

647
00:37:31,672 --> 00:37:33,960
Scott: Not jazz hands and he plays the bass.

648
00:37:34,722 --> 00:37:36,847
Rym: So polar bears cafe.

649
00:37:36,867 --> 00:37:38,170
Scott: I only saw one episode.

650
00:37:38,972 --> 00:37:39,934
Rym: I only saw one episode.

651
00:37:40,035 --> 00:37:41,939
Scott: Okay, it is a review of one episode.

652
00:37:42,702 --> 00:37:43,265
Rym: You know what it is.

653
00:37:43,285 --> 00:37:46,580
Rym: This is a show about a polar bear runs a cafe.

654
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,764
Scott: Well, that's the thing right.

655
00:37:48,025 --> 00:37:58,000
Scott: the show is called polar bear cafe and there is a literal cafe run by a polar bear Who's pretty cool, but the first episode focused entirely on this panda who was trying to get a job there.

656
00:37:58,305 --> 00:37:59,140
Scott: Well, he's trying to get a job.

657
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,485
Scott: Well, you wouldn't want to get a job.

658
00:38:00,525 --> 00:38:03,597
Scott: His mom was making him get a job with a vacuum cleaner, right?

659
00:38:03,638 --> 00:38:16,200
Scott: But anyway And that is the polar bear cafe was almost secondary and it focused mostly on this lazy-ass panda Who wasn't getting a job and was laying around his mom's house all day doing nothing and wanted to do nothing.

660
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,712
Scott: It was super lazy because he's a panda.

661
00:38:17,732 --> 00:38:20,279
Scott: He just wanted to eat bamboo Because that's a panda's do.

662
00:38:21,961 --> 00:38:26,756
Scott: And I wonder if in the later episodes the focus goes off the panda to these other characters.

663
00:38:26,797 --> 00:38:27,840
Rym: I'm pretty sure it does.

664
00:38:27,921 --> 00:38:29,716
Rym: It's not the panda bears cafe.

665
00:38:29,776 --> 00:38:33,580
Scott: Yeah But I'd really I'd want to find out about the polar bear and his cafe.

666
00:38:33,761 --> 00:38:37,180
Scott: I don't really care that much about any learning anything more about the panda, but I like it.

667
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:40,075
Rym: So it's one of those odd shows is very atmospheric.

668
00:38:40,136 --> 00:38:51,899
Scott: It's very punny Like the Bear is a pretty serious dude except for when he always does a million puns whenever he can, you know, and that's like his deal.

669
00:38:53,561 --> 00:38:54,845
Rym: But here's what I know.

670
00:38:54,925 --> 00:38:57,715
Rym: the first I like the voice actor like of the polar bear.

671
00:38:57,876 --> 00:38:58,217
Rym: Mm-hmm.

672
00:38:58,277 --> 00:39:02,311
Rym: You know that is It's a Takahiro Sakurai and you probably remember him.

673
00:39:02,331 --> 00:39:04,320
Rym: don't know who that is the main character in gatekeepers.

674
00:39:05,121 --> 00:39:06,411
Scott: Okay, you know shouldn't?

675
00:39:06,753 --> 00:39:13,637
Scott: yeah gatekeepers That was the biggest show for a little while for five and RIT cuz it was the only digitally fan sub show.

676
00:39:13,657 --> 00:39:17,554
Rym: Yep Then gatekeepers 21, which I never even watched.

677
00:39:17,654 --> 00:39:24,619
Rym: I watched like one episode Yeah, but for some reason that show for us at that time was the best show ever for like five minutes.

678
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:26,044
Scott: Yeah Well, it's all good.

679
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:26,726
Scott: Let's do a show on game.

680
00:39:26,766 --> 00:39:29,255
Rym: You can open the gate.

681
00:39:29,275 --> 00:39:30,318
Rym: We gotta watch it everyone.

682
00:39:30,338 --> 00:39:30,780
Scott: Have we done?

683
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,707
Rym: There's no way on it.

684
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:36,384
Rym: I'll search anyway, but anyway Something else I found out.

685
00:39:36,605 --> 00:39:41,020
Rym: this is directed by the same person who directed cheese sweet home.

686
00:39:41,822 --> 00:39:51,372
Rym: It's got almost the exact same kind of pacing like a character will say something And they're a manga for polar bear cafe cuz he's sweet home as a manga.

687
00:39:51,392 --> 00:39:52,977
Rym: This is why we're not anime world order.

688
00:39:53,177 --> 00:39:55,300
Rym: Yeah Anyway, it does that thing.

689
00:39:55,340 --> 00:40:06,775
Rym: We're like a scene will start and the characters are kind of just sitting there For a while and then someone says something and then the camera Stays there for a little while after it's very short on dialogue.

690
00:40:06,795 --> 00:40:07,900
Scott: They don't say any words.

691
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,049
Scott: They don't have to say mitsuyuki masahara.

692
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:10,672
Scott: Mm-hmm.

693
00:40:11,234 --> 00:40:12,519
Rym: I did not know who that was until now.

694
00:40:12,841 --> 00:40:14,506
Rym: Okay, but cheese sweet home.

695
00:40:14,526 --> 00:40:18,339
Rym: I can see I'd also learned there's a sequel to cheese sweet home that I didn't know about.

696
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:20,951
Rym: cool I feel like I gotta get back into the anime loop.

697
00:40:21,233 --> 00:40:21,977
Rym: nice a little bit.

698
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:25,400
Scott: So The other thing is the way the show works, right?

699
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:33,904
Scott: He's like, well the polar bear runs the cafe though It's some world that looks like modern-day Japan except there are normal people who are humans 100% just humans.

700
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,067
Scott: and there are animals.

701
00:40:35,589 --> 00:40:38,798
Scott: and the animals aren't like furry animals where they like cat people.

702
00:40:38,838 --> 00:40:39,440
Scott: They're just people.

703
00:40:39,781 --> 00:40:40,403
Scott: It's just up.

704
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:41,387
Scott: It is a polar bear.

705
00:40:41,407 --> 00:40:43,676
Scott: It wears clothes, but it is a polar bear.

706
00:40:43,716 --> 00:40:44,640
Rym: I love the polar.

707
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:46,245
Scott: Is a panda.

708
00:40:46,405 --> 00:40:48,772
Rym: love out at the zoo the interviews for a job.

709
00:40:48,812 --> 00:40:51,340
Rym: That's like be a panda at right zoo.

710
00:40:51,541 --> 00:40:56,740
Scott: But they these animals interact with society as if they are persons, right?

711
00:40:56,841 --> 00:41:03,440
Scott: So even though it's you know Biologically a panda it talks it has I guess the equivalent of a social security card.

712
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,499
Scott: It has jobs and a house and money and you know, he doesn't have a job, right?

713
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:14,345
Scott: Well, I mean, but I mean it might as well be a person that is just biologically a panda with a human brain Capabilities.

714
00:41:14,587 --> 00:41:16,760
Rym: so maybe we were talking about this when we watch the show.

715
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:21,754
Rym: Maybe it's all just people and these characters are being represented.

716
00:41:21,794 --> 00:41:22,556
Scott: That's what I'm thinking.

717
00:41:22,596 --> 00:41:23,820
Rym: is their spirit animal?

718
00:41:24,161 --> 00:41:24,765
Scott: It's all.

719
00:41:24,866 --> 00:41:26,917
Scott: it's actually all people literally.

720
00:41:27,098 --> 00:41:33,660
Scott: but Instead of drawing the panda who as a person who has the spirit of a panda and acts like a panda?

721
00:41:33,921 --> 00:41:38,480
Scott: So they draw him as a panda and call him panda, but it's really a person but it doesn't matter.

722
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,465
Scott: That's really a person.

723
00:41:39,545 --> 00:41:45,395
Rym: that reality will be ruined in like episode 3 when the pole I'm sure someone randomly and then the show goes back to right.

724
00:41:45,516 --> 00:41:46,220
Scott: so it's kind of funny.

725
00:41:46,261 --> 00:41:53,600
Scott: He gets a job at the zoo Right, which and he has to like perform for the nursery school, but that other pan is a full-time panda.

726
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:56,330
Scott: Yeah, he was just a part-time zoo panda time panda.

727
00:41:56,912 --> 00:41:58,558
Scott: Yeah, but it was funny.

728
00:41:58,578 --> 00:41:59,080
Scott: was the nursery?

729
00:41:59,281 --> 00:42:00,545
Scott: What the nursery school?

730
00:42:00,565 --> 00:42:01,950
Scott: kids all seem to be human, right?

731
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:03,776
Scott: Did you didn't see any animals in nursery schools?

732
00:42:03,796 --> 00:42:06,542
Rym: Don't go to school I don't know.

733
00:42:06,602 --> 00:42:07,264
Scott: I was under the impression.

734
00:42:07,304 --> 00:42:11,616
Scott: The panda was in school, but graduated and didn't want to work.

735
00:42:12,017 --> 00:42:13,160
Scott: I don't know whatever.

736
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,523
Scott: Yes, it's cool.

737
00:42:15,543 --> 00:42:20,640
Scott: how the animals the you know, it's sort of like Damaka dobutsu in which the animals express their nature.

738
00:42:20,821 --> 00:42:22,048
Scott: The panda acts like a panda.

739
00:42:22,068 --> 00:42:23,959
Scott: he's lazy and he wants to eat bamboo and that's it.

740
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:28,540
Rym: Yeah, but it's not like the polar bear because polar bears aren't necessarily known for their puns and cafes.

741
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:35,034
Scott: Maybe they are in Japan I don't know But I don't think I. the thing of the difference from Damaka dobutsu is Damaka dobutsu.

742
00:42:35,055 --> 00:42:36,961
Scott: the animals are the opposite of their nature Right.

743
00:42:37,001 --> 00:42:40,433
Scott: So the wolf was all you know, sappy or whatever right in this.

744
00:42:40,794 --> 00:42:42,500
Scott: the animals match their nature, right?

745
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:47,566
Scott: So if there was a wolf in this you would be all eating people like a hey He's not there isn't?

746
00:42:47,887 --> 00:42:48,289
Scott: I don't think.

747
00:42:48,329 --> 00:42:49,414
Scott: what were the other animals?

748
00:42:49,756 --> 00:42:50,700
Scott: it was a sloth, right?

749
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,767
Scott: Yep, and the polar bear.

750
00:42:53,329 --> 00:42:54,613
Scott: and who was the guy who's always at the counter?

751
00:42:54,633 --> 00:42:56,520
Scott: the I don't remember.

752
00:42:56,742 --> 00:42:58,335
Scott: I don't remember just watched it.

753
00:42:58,516 --> 00:42:58,819
Scott: I know.

754
00:42:59,482 --> 00:43:01,669
Scott: Anyway, the animals the animals are like the best characters.

755
00:43:01,749 --> 00:43:03,054
Rym: It's a cute show.

756
00:43:03,415 --> 00:43:04,318
Scott: Yeah, very good.

757
00:43:04,579 --> 00:43:13,541
Scott: Oh, right There's the whole part where he's interviewing animals for than everybody said all the animals match their nature so none of them were good for working at the Cafe.

758
00:43:13,582 --> 00:43:16,249
Rym: so then he's like I've decided to hire this girl.

759
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:21,845
Scott: the human girl is the best worker for the cafe, of course But it's a cute show.

760
00:43:21,965 --> 00:43:22,386
Rym: I like it.

761
00:43:22,627 --> 00:43:22,908
Rym: Actually.

762
00:43:22,928 --> 00:43:24,573
Rym: I like all three of these shows.

763
00:43:24,593 --> 00:43:27,180
Scott: I'm kind of what eventually watch all these shows.

764
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,880
Scott: Yep, I'm gonna finish Lupin first and definitely that's a higher priority show.

765
00:43:33,482 --> 00:43:35,448
Scott: But yeah, there's a lot suddenly right?

766
00:43:35,588 --> 00:43:40,786
Scott: There's no big-name new awesome animes like Madoka unless there's one I don't notice happening right now.

767
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:41,589
Rym: I think we'd notice.

768
00:43:41,629 --> 00:43:43,415
Rym: I mean remember when Madoka didn't notice.

769
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:44,057
Scott: Madoka tells 100% done.

770
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:46,245
Rym: Yeah, but we noticed.

771
00:43:46,486 --> 00:43:48,533
Scott: I knew it was a giant thread in our forum.

772
00:43:48,573 --> 00:43:50,720
Rym: I just didn't watch it, but I knew about it.

773
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:53,720
Rym: I knew that's the big anime that everyone's talking about, right?

774
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,620
Scott: So there doesn't seem to be a big anime right now a Madoka style that we want.

775
00:43:57,981 --> 00:44:01,052
Scott: But there are plenty of good animes happening right now.

776
00:44:01,113 --> 00:44:08,260
Scott: suddenly that are really smaller under-the-radar Animes that are good for people like us, but maybe not good for the anime community at large.

777
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,356
Scott: You're not gonna see polar bear cafe cosplay if I do.

778
00:44:11,477 --> 00:44:13,840
Rym: Oh my gosh I think there will be but it'll be in the city.

779
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,611
Rym: It'll be like our crowd or Mike tools crowd Darryl's crowd.

780
00:44:16,651 --> 00:44:18,920
Rym: Those people will dress up in a duffel.

781
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:21,699
Scott: Hey, you're not gonna see Japanese folktale cosplay.

782
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,414
Scott: Oh, you know dominating the conventions ahead of say the bleach cosplay, but I bleach.

783
00:44:26,454 --> 00:44:28,300
Rym: I think you mean homestuck, right?

784
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:28,962
Scott: Exactly.

785
00:44:29,684 --> 00:44:34,040
Scott: But anyway, there are these good under-the-radar small-time shows that are kind of awesome.

786
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:38,597
Scott: And if you really need an anime to watch and you really don't guess what they're all there's nothing.

787
00:44:38,637 --> 00:44:38,898
Rym: you're all.

788
00:44:38,918 --> 00:44:41,550
Scott: you can watch them Legally, yeah, you can watch all these things legally.

789
00:44:41,731 --> 00:44:46,328
Scott: I think they're all on crunchy real kids in the slopus Crunchy roll Lupin is funimation.

790
00:44:46,488 --> 00:44:47,995
Scott: All these all the rest of those are all crunchy roll.

791
00:44:48,015 --> 00:44:48,798
Scott: Yeah free.

792
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:55,075
Rym: so If you really need it to anime, you know, it's an aside, but you know Like we talked about in the churn something that's happened.

793
00:44:55,136 --> 00:44:55,619
Rym: Is that for?

794
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,182
Rym: Internet types.

795
00:44:57,744 --> 00:45:01,896
Rym: anime has gotten pretty mainstream and that it a lot of people watch these shows.

796
00:45:01,956 --> 00:45:03,060
Rym: a lot of people like anime.

797
00:45:03,554 --> 00:45:05,245
Scott: Yeah people have enough.

798
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:12,159
Scott: people are watching these folk tales to where it's worth for a while for crunchy roll to pay to get the Rights to put it on crunchy roll and to sell ads on it.

799
00:45:12,321 --> 00:45:13,447
Rym: But I think what what happened?

800
00:45:13,467 --> 00:45:19,069
Rym: we talked about in the last show too, but specifically Most of the people are watching anime nowadays.

801
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:22,720
Rym: I don't think are engaged in anime fan culture.

802
00:45:22,742 --> 00:45:30,731
Scott: Yeah I think there's people who go to crunchy roll who are watching these shows who are not going to cons not going on message boards Not reading anime news network not doing anything like that.

803
00:45:30,992 --> 00:45:32,780
Scott: They're just going to crunchy roll and watching these shows.

804
00:45:32,962 --> 00:45:34,480
Rym: I think there's a. I think there's three categories.

805
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:38,980
Rym: There's what you said and then there's the people who do those things and go to anime cons.

806
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,840
Rym: So they seem to be the minority at the anime cons now, but there's a third part.

807
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:48,842
Rym: I think there are people who do read anime news network and they engage in a lot of the online Stuff like.

808
00:45:48,862 --> 00:45:49,887
Rym: they'll research anime.

809
00:45:49,907 --> 00:45:51,193
Rym: They'll be into that stuff.

810
00:45:51,675 --> 00:45:52,860
Rym: They'll post on the anime news network.

811
00:45:53,001 --> 00:45:59,254
Rym: They just don't go to cons at all Because the cons have a lot less anime stuff than the internet does.

812
00:45:59,274 --> 00:46:01,180
Scott: Yeah, I mean Homestuck is the best anime, right?

813
00:46:01,381 --> 00:46:07,542
Rym: Yeah, yeah, well the most popular anime sure that in My Little Pony, yeah Okay, we're done.
