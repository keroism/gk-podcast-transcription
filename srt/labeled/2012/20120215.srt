1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,938
Rym: It's Wednesday, February 15th, 2012.

2
00:00:09,938 --> 00:00:12,547
Rym: I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:22,821
Rym: Tonight, we bring you the stunning conclusion of our reviews of every single one of the DC new 52.

4
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:23,838
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,660
Rym: So All-Star Western 1, basically Batman.

6
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,660
Scott: Uh, well, let me give you a little information here, right?

7
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,640
Scott: So, you know, you get this Jonah Hex situation going on, right?

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,950
Scott: And I was reading the Jonah Hex.

9
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,240
Scott: Did we do an episode on it at some point?

10
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,220
Scott: I don't know if we did or not.

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,120
Scott: But basically, this is written by, it's got Jonah Hex in it, at least half of it, right?

12
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:53,155
Scott: And it's written by the same guys, the same team that did that Jonah Hex.

13
00:00:53,175 --> 00:00:54,280
Scott: that's been going on for a while.

14
00:00:54,820 --> 00:01:01,300
Scott: So here you go, it's basically the continuation of Jonah Hex, which has always been sort of episodic and such, so that's kind of nice.

15
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:07,240
Rym: I actually surprisingly enjoyed seeing, like, you know, cowboy time era Gotham.

16
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:13,380
Rym: Like, I like that whole aspect of, like, you know, seeing the old families and all this stuff kind of together.

17
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:18,500
Rym: But at the same time, the actual plot, as was revealed, was a little too forced and cliche.

18
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:22,259
Rym: Moved a little too quickly, I think.

19
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,280
Scott: Yeah, the thing I wrote, here's my three notes that I wrote, right?

20
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:34,120
Scott: First of all, I agreed with you entirely, you know, Jonah Hex that I read in those Jonah Hex books was a different character.

21
00:01:34,382 --> 00:01:37,420
Scott: Even though this Jonah Hex, it's the same person on paper.

22
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,860
Rym: He is way too not an asshole.

23
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,859
Scott: I wrote, Jonah Hex is basically just old-timey Batman here.

24
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,640
Rym: Yup, that's what I was saying, this was Batman.

25
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,438
Scott: Number two, I think the doctor did it.

26
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,400
Scott: And number three, this is a mystery, not a Western.

27
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,160
Scott: Even though it takes place in Western times and is drawn like a Western, and everything looks Western, this is a mystery story.

28
00:01:56,801 --> 00:01:59,420
Scott: You know, the same way the Star Trek is not sci-fi as a soap opera.

29
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,700
Rym: Mystery story, so two counts of Batman.

30
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,136
Scott: Right, exactly.

31
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:04,560
Rym: And it's in Gotham.

32
00:02:06,082 --> 00:02:09,900
Scott: And that's the thing though, the Batman comics weren't actually mysteries.

33
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,440
Scott: Detective Comics wasn't a detective story.

34
00:02:13,581 --> 00:02:17,380
Scott: But All-Star Western isn't a Western, it's the mystery the Detective Comics should have been.

35
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,256
Scott: So does this mean that I have to read All-Star Horror to get the Western story?

36
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,020
Rym: No, that would be a comedy.

37
00:02:26,301 --> 00:02:29,700
Scott: But yeah, it wasn't a bad mystery, I guess.

38
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,173
Scott: I also, you know.

39
00:02:32,264 --> 00:02:33,536
Rym: I kind of liked it, it was a high meh.

40
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,008
Scott: Yeah.

41
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,599
Rym: It just, that wasn't Jonah Hex.

42
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:37,917
Rym: No, it wasn't.

43
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,680
Rym: Jonah Hex would not have suffered most of those people to live.

44
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,100
Scott: You know, this is the thing, I've mentioned it a hundred times, hopefully this will be the last time I mention it.

45
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,400
Scott: But it's like, you have a character, a character has a personality, there's something about that character, right?

46
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:52,140
Scott: And I mean, you know, it's like, what's Mario like?

47
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,440
Scott: You know, if I say, if I mention Mario, you know what Mario is like.

48
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:57,900
Rym: He's a fat plumber named Lou Albano.

49
00:02:58,401 --> 00:03:06,760
Scott: Right, I could make a story, draw Mario in it, call him Mario, but he could act like, you know, a princess instead of being the plumber.

50
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,696
Scott: And he could be like, you know, "Oh, save

51
00:03:08,716 --> 00:03:08,776
Scott: me.".

52
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,674
Scott: "It's a pretty, pretty

53
00:03:09,694 --> 00:03:09,900
Scott: princess.".

54
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,460
Scott: He wouldn't even have the accent, right?

55
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,840
Scott: And it's like, well, you drew Mario and you called him Mario, but that's not Mario.

56
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,980
Scott: And that's what goes on in these DC Comics, is they draw a character.

57
00:03:19,161 --> 00:03:20,400
Scott: Well, Batman is the worst example.

58
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,624
Scott: It looks like the character, they name it.

59
00:03:21,644 --> 00:03:25,940
Scott: that character, doesn't act like that character, acts like someone else in every different book.

60
00:03:26,361 --> 00:03:31,300
Rym: The Batman in Justice League isn't, he's nothing like any other Batman anywhere.

61
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,446
Scott: Justice League International.

62
00:03:32,506 --> 00:03:35,139
Scott: Batman is the Super Friends Batman, right?

63
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,180
Rym: That Batman was the same, I don't even want to, we already talked about how bad that was.

64
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,999
Rym: Alright, so let's move on.

65
00:03:40,164 --> 00:03:41,680
Rym: I liked Aquaman, I was surprised.

66
00:03:41,881 --> 00:03:45,115
Scott: Aquaman, I was going into this and I was saying, "Well, it's Aquaman.

67
00:03:45,176 --> 00:03:45,919
Scott: Everyone makes fun of

68
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:46,120
Scott: Aquaman.".

69
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:53,180
Scott: It's written by Geoff Johns, the guy we hate, who wrote the Green Lantern Rebirth, who, you know, does all the most fanboyish stuff.

70
00:03:53,921 --> 00:04:00,600
Scott: But you read this and you're like, okay, how is, you know, everyone, people have tried to do Aquaman for years and everyone has failed.

71
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,735
Scott: What is this guy going to do to do Aquaman?

72
00:04:03,755 --> 00:04:04,500
Scott: He's starting fresh.

73
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,820
Rym: Well, let's see, the plot involves the ocean.

74
00:04:07,322 --> 00:04:08,129
Scott: It does, that's good.

75
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:09,260
Scott: That's a good start.

76
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,780
Scott: Keeping Aquaman in the ocean, not in the Justice League satellite dish, whatever.

77
00:04:13,062 --> 00:04:14,100
Rym: And he's got a personality.

78
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,980
Scott: He does, and I don't know what Aquaman's personality is.

79
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,200
Scott: I'm willing to bet that this is not the personality Aquaman has had in the past.

80
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,500
Scott: But I like this one.

81
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,700
Scott: Yeah, I've seen pictures of like old Aquaman, like bearded Aquaman and all sorts of, right?

82
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,320
Scott: Pretty sure this is not anything like those ones, but maybe that's good because those other Aquamans sucked.

83
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:39,160
Rym: Yeah, well like, Scott, while the Jonah Hex in All Star Western was not a real Jonah Hex, that's the one I'd rather hang out with in a bar if I had to choose.

84
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:39,702
Scott: That's right.

85
00:04:39,943 --> 00:04:43,020
Scott: This Aquaman is kind of an awesome dude.

86
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,139
Rym: Because he's kind of a dick.

87
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,959
Scott: He's sort of Rainbow Dash-ish.

88
00:04:47,002 --> 00:04:50,821
Rym: Isn't that what we also liked about Superman in Action Comics 1?

89
00:04:50,821 --> 00:04:51,577
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

90
00:04:52,381 --> 00:04:53,979
Scott: It's sort of the same kind of guy.

91
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,960
Rym: A little bit of Rainbow Dash, a little bit of Astro Boy, all mixed into one.

92
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,900
Scott: And then he was pretty awesome when he just gives the waitress the two undersea golden coins.

93
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,698
Rym: She's like, "What the fuck am I supposed to do with

94
00:05:03,718 --> 00:05:03,860
Rym: this?".

95
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,811
Rym: He's like, "Send your kids to

96
00:05:04,852 --> 00:05:05,277
Rym: college?".

97
00:05:05,701 --> 00:05:08,818
Scott: Yeah, and she's just like, "Holy shit, fucking Aquaman's got-".

98
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,517
Rym: I love how they go right in and have the nerd be like, "How's it feel to be everyone's least favorite

99
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:14,080
Rym: superhero?".

100
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,100
Rym: And how Aquaman just punks the kid.

101
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:16,616
Scott: Yeah.

102
00:05:17,422 --> 00:05:17,987
Rym: I like this one.

103
00:05:18,008 --> 00:05:19,240
Rym: I want to read the trade when it comes out.

104
00:05:19,341 --> 00:05:21,620
Scott: Yeah, I actually realized that, but it is good.

105
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:24,140
Scott: It's like the exact opposite.

106
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:24,903
Scott: You know what?

107
00:05:24,923 --> 00:05:26,959
Scott: I bet the fanboys probably hated this Aquaman.

108
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,719
Rym: They had to have.

109
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,668
Scott: Maybe.

110
00:05:29,235 --> 00:05:29,640
Scott: Who knows?

111
00:05:31,284 --> 00:05:34,120
Scott: I think it's just something about jerk characters that I just personally like.

112
00:05:34,242 --> 00:05:35,580
Rym: It has to be a certain kind of jerk, though.

113
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,890
Scott: Yeah, that certain kind of jerk.

114
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,979
Scott: I like it no matter what.

115
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,980
Scott: Who knows if this is actually good, but it's Scott Rubin's alley.

116
00:05:44,162 --> 00:05:46,320
Rym: Speaking of Batman, there's another Batman here.

117
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,019
Scott: How many Batmans are there going to be?

118
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:50,179
Rym: I forget which one this is.

119
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,720
Scott: This is Batman colon The Dark Knight.

120
00:05:53,422 --> 00:05:56,580
Rym: Was this the one with the Joker cutting his face off?

121
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,580
Scott: No, that was Detective Comics, right?

122
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,438
Rym: Oh my god, I don't even remember then.

123
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,252
Rym: Which one was this?

124
00:06:02,374 --> 00:06:02,880
Rym: What happens?

125
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,448
Scott: I barely remember.

126
00:06:04,488 --> 00:06:06,200
Scott: Let me look at my notes about it.

127
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,849
Rym: My note just says, "It's

128
00:06:07,929 --> 00:06:08,473
Rym: Batman.".

129
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,539
Rym: I didn't write anything else.

130
00:06:11,524 --> 00:06:11,867
Scott: Oh, right.

131
00:06:11,887 --> 00:06:13,360
Scott: This is the one with one face.

132
00:06:14,623 --> 00:06:15,896
Rym: Oh, all right.

133
00:06:15,936 --> 00:06:16,320
Rym: I remember.

134
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,120
Rym: This one had way too much supervillain bullshit.

135
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,009
Rym: And it felt way more like superhero.

136
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,294
Rym: supervillain and way less.

137
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:25,800
Rym: Batman is just a person.

138
00:06:26,941 --> 00:06:30,000
Scott: Yeah, my notes were not even one clever thing.

139
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,040
Scott: I don't know what that was meaning.

140
00:06:31,828 --> 00:06:32,660
Scott: All over the place.

141
00:06:33,241 --> 00:06:34,520
Rym: Yeah, the plot didn't make any sense.

142
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,199
Scott: Here's the other thing.

143
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,700
Scott: I wrote that it wasn't related to the other Batman books at all, which is good and bad, right?

144
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:54,060
Scott: It's good on the one hand that, well, you can read it on its own, but it's sort of bad in that, you know, it's like they set the expectation that there's some mixing with the other books, and then when one of the books doesn't mix, it's like, well, now this one doesn't even fit.

145
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,314
Scott: More importantly, why are you-- Like the one where Batman showed up in Africa.

146
00:06:57,435 --> 00:06:58,040
Scott: It doesn't fit.

147
00:06:58,721 --> 00:07:13,800
Rym: Yeah, because if you're throwing, if you've got three straight up Batman comics, and they're all different, and they don't line up, and they're all kind of uninspired, the fact that I couldn't remember which one was which actually is very telling in my opinion.

148
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,680
Scott: Yeah, I was able to remember that Aquaman was an awesome jerk.

149
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,940
Rym: And I like detective comics the most of the Batman.

150
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:30,139
Scott: This one was sort of structured, though, as sort of the same way as like the start of a Batman movie, where you have the Bruce Wayne part where he's getting all business-y.

151
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,380
Rym: But I hate the Batman movies.

152
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,700
Scott: And then you'll have that, you know, Batman fights all the villains part after that, right?

153
00:07:36,802 --> 00:07:38,040
Scott: And that was sort of the way it went.

154
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,560
Rym: I hate Batman fighting a villain, like, straight up.

155
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,520
Rym: I like all the other stuff about Batman.

156
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,240
Rym: The villain part is just the vehicle for my Batman enjoyment.

157
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,480
Rym: If you actually think I care about the villain part, then you don't understand why I like Batman.

158
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:57,020
Scott: Well, if you like those Batman video games, you probably love this, because he just walks around punching and kicking all the bad guys in Arkham.

159
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,176
Scott: So yeah.

160
00:07:58,722 --> 00:08:00,640
Scott: So Black Hawks-- I put that as bad.

161
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,958
Rym: Yeah, I put it as bad, too.

162
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:06,120
Rym: Well, I didn't put it as bad, but since I don't remember it, it had to have been bad.

163
00:08:06,422 --> 00:08:08,960
Rym: So, Black Hawks, I have one note.

164
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,640
Rym: Why is the logo of their secret organization on the side of their--.

165
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,280
Scott: Are you reading my fucking notes?

166
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,340
Rym: Because the fact that it was there didn't bother me.

167
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,420
Rym: The fact that a guy took a picture of it was funny.

168
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,800
Rym: The fact that that is the plot is crazy bullshit.

169
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,260
Scott: You don't see the fucking Navy Seals walking around with the word Navy Seals on the side of a truck driving around the city.

170
00:08:30,023 --> 00:08:36,220
Rym: And if the Black Hawks are this crazy, ultra-elite organization, seriously, that's your plot?

171
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:42,960
Scott: They have a logo that everyone knows that they slap all over their bodies and all over everything they own, and it's bright yellow and everyone can see it.

172
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:59,920
Scott: That pissed me off enough to hate it already, but the whole-- Also, this is yet another-- I should count how many of these books were secret government or corporate organization with an acronym sort of-ish name, goes and fights some generic terrorist group of some kind.

173
00:09:00,201 --> 00:09:04,693
Rym: But also, way too much-- It was very clumsily.

174
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:13,119
Rym: The whole thing about she was bitten and the nanocytes were in her was so clumsily set up that I actually didn't expect it because it seemed too obvious and cliche.

175
00:09:13,601 --> 00:09:13,763
Scott: Yeah.

176
00:09:14,005 --> 00:09:23,378
Scott: I think that there's some-- I get the feeling that someone's done some sort of focus group study that's like, "Well, if we add a sidekick, then the sales go

177
00:09:23,418 --> 00:09:23,479
Scott: up.".

178
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,280
Scott: Is that information they use?

179
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:35,418
Scott: And someone figured out, "Well, books about paramilitary organizations fighting bad guys in such and such a format get great ratings, so let's make seven comics about that and ten TV

180
00:09:35,478 --> 00:09:35,660
Scott: shows.".

181
00:09:35,721 --> 00:09:44,239
Rym: Well, Scott, what is Ghost in the Shell's stand-alone complex, but a paramilitary organization fighting bad guys with awesome technology and equipment secretly funded by the government with acronyms?

182
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:51,980
Scott: That's correct, but they add an extra layer on top of that, which is it's actually procedural police-detectiving, sort of.

183
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:57,840
Rym: Except it isn't because they replace all the procedural police stuff with proper-known gobbledygook bullshit.

184
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,849
Scott: It's also actually real sci-fi.

185
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:02,140
Scott: At least Ghost in the Shell is actually real sci-fi.

186
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,359
Scott: Reels, like, you know, for serious.

187
00:10:05,801 --> 00:10:08,110
Scott: But this, at least, is not.

188
00:10:08,171 --> 00:10:10,340
Scott: This is just government organization fighting some guys.

189
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:21,356
Rym: Had it not been so clumsily done and had the picture of their logo not been the plot, then I would have said, "Meh, but I have to say bad because I really didn't like

190
00:10:21,377 --> 00:10:21,417
Rym: it.".

191
00:10:22,141 --> 00:10:23,620
Scott: Yeah, I mean, the thing-- whatever.

192
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,360
Scott: I actually like some of the equipment they had because you see all these people get special equipment.

193
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,893
Scott: This guy's got really cool sunglasses.

194
00:10:29,954 --> 00:10:30,499
Scott: I kind of want those.

195
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:32,960
Rym: They're not as good as the Deus Ex sunglasses.

196
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,119
Rym: Those are the best sunglasses ever.

197
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,739
Scott: Black Hawks, I put bad.

198
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,859
Scott: So The Flash-- He's the fastest dude.

199
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:41,802
Rym: Yeah.

200
00:10:42,825 --> 00:10:47,120
Rym: I'm surprised that I needed to know more about The Flash than I did.

201
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,760
Rym: Either that or it just was a poorly told story.

202
00:10:51,662 --> 00:10:54,619
Scott: First of all, The Flash is one of the main dudes, right?

203
00:10:55,042 --> 00:10:56,067
Scott: And I was actually surprised.

204
00:10:56,128 --> 00:10:57,777
Scott: The Flash was not in any of the other 51 books.

205
00:10:58,762 --> 00:11:00,599
Scott: He was only in this one, so good job on that.

206
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,839
Scott: Two, I actually kind of like these arts.

207
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,200
Rym: I also like the art.

208
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:10,320
Scott: The sort of faded-out, grayish look with almost-- I don't know if that's sort of water-color-y-ish.

209
00:11:11,144 --> 00:11:13,418
Scott: I don't know much about arts, but I sort of liked--.

210
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:23,719
Scott: It was pleasant to look at because the contrast wasn't so high, but it was still colorful, and I don't know if it was accidental, but I hope it wasn't because it was pretty cool.

211
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:34,460
Scott: But here's the thing that really bothered me, which I've mentioned sort of already, which is how come the bad guys even have time to say anything, right?

212
00:11:34,821 --> 00:11:35,545
Scott: It's The Flash.

213
00:11:35,867 --> 00:11:43,160
Scott: The bad guys wouldn't even be able to say one word, and then The Flash just-- even if he was going to stop and take care of them, they would just be knocked out instantly.

214
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,560
Scott: You just punch them in the face really fast, and they don't talk, ever.

215
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,888
Scott: So how come the scenes where The Flash is talking with a guy and sort of fighting with him?

216
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,380
Scott: Those scenes cannot happen.

217
00:11:51,641 --> 00:11:52,365
Scott: He's The Flash.

218
00:11:52,385 --> 00:11:55,060
Scott: He's so fast, you would not see him.

219
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,840
Scott: The bad guy would not even be able to see him to start a fight with him.

220
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,720
Scott: It would just be over before the bad guy even knew The Flash was there.

221
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:08,379
Rym: Also, every time The Flash needs to appear, he runs away at his slow-ass speed and then turns to The Flash and comes back.

222
00:12:09,621 --> 00:12:10,308
Rym: No one notices.

223
00:12:10,349 --> 00:12:11,400
Rym: That's even worse than Superman.

224
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,635
Scott: That's even worse than Superman in the phone booth, whatever.

225
00:12:17,505 --> 00:12:19,080
Scott: But yeah, it's The Flash.

226
00:12:19,663 --> 00:12:21,151
Scott: I also wrote Jin Ro armor.

227
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:22,920
Scott: Was there Jin Ro armor in here for some reason?

228
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,145
Scott: I'm trying to find it.

229
00:12:24,367 --> 00:12:24,870
Scott: Maybe that was it.

230
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:25,997
Scott: I wrote it under the wrong--.

231
00:12:26,821 --> 00:12:28,040
Scott: Did I write it under the wrong comic?

232
00:12:29,002 --> 00:12:31,620
Rym: I wrote Jin Ro-- Yeah, the soldiers that he was fighting in the beginning.

233
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:40,440
Rym: He killed the guy by throwing him into the wall or into the building, and then the guy ended up being a clone of his old friend, and there's a million of them, and I didn't care anymore.

234
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,740
Scott: Oh yeah, right in the beginning, all these dudes are wearing sort of Jin Ro-ish armor.

235
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,420
Scott: I really like this page, though, the title page.

236
00:12:46,863 --> 00:12:49,340
Scott: It's like, man, The Arts is really good on that shit.

237
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:53,900
Rym: Honestly, the only thing I didn't like about it was that the story seemed really kind of boring.

238
00:12:54,681 --> 00:13:08,560
Scott: Yeah, if I was doing a story about The Flash, I would make it all about The Flash having all these mental problems, because he just goes so fast and he sees so many things, and his brain isn't any better, right?

239
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,454
Rym: Maybe it is faster.

240
00:13:09,474 --> 00:13:09,800
Rym: We don't know.

241
00:13:09,941 --> 00:13:32,040
Scott: So it's just like he's traveling all around the world, and he gets disoriented and sort of fucked up, and he could even be leading five lives simultaneously, but he could run back and forth between the different lives so quickly that it's instantaneous, that if you were having a conversation with one of them, you wouldn't even notice that he was leaving, because he'd be there for one fifth of every nanosecond.

242
00:13:32,883 --> 00:13:35,040
Scott: I would do shit like that and make it some crazy story.

243
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:47,539
Rym: Well, The Flash runs into the problem of his powers such that you have to be really clever or really narrow path to make any challenge that would fit, that he wouldn't just solve immediately.

244
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:55,760
Scott: Alright, so Firestorm, well, the fury of Firestorm, the nuclear man.

245
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:03,918
Rym: I didn't get that it was only two guys, not three, and that it was the two combined into one until I read Wikipedia, because I couldn't figure out what was going on.

246
00:14:04,922 --> 00:14:09,940
Scott: I only knew it because I had heard about Firestorm in the past from other people.

247
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:11,419
Scott: I knew that it was two guys.

248
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,406
Rym: It didn't make sense.

249
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:14,120
Rym: I read Wikipedia, now it makes sense.

250
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:15,599
Rym: This was just awful.

251
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,377
Scott: It was awful.

252
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,360
Rym: It was like everything I hate about comics condensed.

253
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:26,420
Rym: With forced high school drama, and then obviously the two- All the fake sciency talk as usual.

254
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,120
Rym: Yup.

255
00:14:29,446 --> 00:14:30,519
Scott: Yeah, what else is there to say?

256
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,180
Rym: And how did that girl survive, get the blow up?

257
00:14:34,045 --> 00:14:34,551
Rym: I didn't care.

258
00:14:34,571 --> 00:14:35,340
Rym: It was terrible.

259
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,120
Scott: Yeah, and it's like it could be the key to all human knowledge, really.

260
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:39,557
Scott: Yeah.

261
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:42,400
Scott: That's what Firestorm is dealing with, the key to all human knowledge.

262
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,860
Scott: What's Superman dealing with, right?

263
00:14:45,121 --> 00:14:45,732
Scott: I mean, really?

264
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,080
Scott: There's something that's dealing with the key to all human knowledge.

265
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,500
Scott: Is that important, and Firestorm is the guy who's dealing with that?

266
00:14:51,788 --> 00:14:51,940
Scott: Yeah.

267
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:56,300
Scott: Not the Justice League, not the Green Lanterns, not someone more important.

268
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,620
Rym: So- Yeah.

269
00:14:59,503 --> 00:14:59,977
Scott: I put bad.

270
00:15:00,721 --> 00:15:03,000
Rym: So Green Lantern- New Guardians.

271
00:15:03,641 --> 00:15:05,879
Scott: So these are like young Green Lanterns, I guess, right?

272
00:15:06,382 --> 00:15:06,937
Scott: Something like that?

273
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:09,819
Scott: They're new Green Lanterns, they're not the other ones?

274
00:15:10,241 --> 00:15:12,480
Rym: I thought this was the one where all the rings disappear.

275
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:14,116
Rym: That was the previous one, wasn't it?

276
00:15:14,842 --> 00:15:15,700
Rym: Green Lantern Corps.

277
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,579
Rym: See, I mix them all up again because I didn't like any of them.

278
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,800
Scott: No, this is the one where all the rings fly away.

279
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,360
Rym: Okay, that's the one I thought we were talking about with Green Lantern Corps.

280
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,079
Scott: No, this is the one where the rings fly away.

281
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,020
Rym: Oh, Green Lantern Corps, I remember which one that was.

282
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,679
Rym: I didn't like it either, but for different reasons.

283
00:15:34,423 --> 00:15:37,638
Rym: This is the one that didn't make sense because all the colors, how would you know?

284
00:15:39,363 --> 00:15:39,978
Rym: What can I say?

285
00:15:40,704 --> 00:15:41,500
Rym: It was terrible.

286
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,859
Rym: Unless you really like Green Lantern and you know all about it.

287
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,000
Scott: All right, so I wrote cute elder guy because of this panel.

288
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,319
Scott: The guy's got the eyeball.

289
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,278
Rym: He's got a good look.

290
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,277
Scott: Yeah, he's got this look.

291
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:59,780
Scott: I also wrote Mary Sue because this character is a comic artist in the comic book.

292
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:06,100
Rym: So also, how come the pink lanterns, I guess, are all girls?

293
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,297
Rym: Like, why?

294
00:16:09,609 --> 00:16:10,019
Scott: Hot ones.

295
00:16:10,601 --> 00:16:10,995
Rym: Yeah, why?

296
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:11,795
Scott: In space.

297
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,840
Scott: And then, here's the other thing.

298
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,040
Scott: This one, more so than any of the other books I've read, right?

299
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,173
Scott: We've read all 52 of them.

300
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,880
Scott: More so than any of them, this felt like pretty much a direct continuation of a previous book.

301
00:16:25,003 --> 00:16:26,840
Scott: It's like some of the other ones, they sort of started...

302
00:16:27,122 --> 00:16:29,519
Rym: Oh, because Red Lanterns had some of the characters in it, too.

303
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:35,820
Scott: Right, but it's like some of the other ones, they tried to start fresh and they brought a few things in that were obviously you had to know.

304
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,540
Scott: This felt like they weren't even trying to start fresh.

305
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:44,000
Scott: It was just direct continuation of something that already happened without starting any newness whatsoever.

306
00:16:44,521 --> 00:16:45,357
Rym: Yeah, it's like season two.

307
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,900
Scott: Yeah, and whatever.

308
00:16:48,783 --> 00:16:50,720
Rym: Every Green Lantern was bad, in my opinion.

309
00:16:51,841 --> 00:16:54,849
Scott: And then it's sort of like this rings all flying away thing.

310
00:16:54,869 --> 00:16:58,840
Scott: was just this excuse to get these bunch of different lanterns all in the same place for no reason.

311
00:16:58,961 --> 00:17:01,880
Rym: And I gotta admit, in all media, I no longer...

312
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,880
Scott: That's worse than the D&D using an "in" to get the characters together.

313
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:14,220
Rym: I no longer ever want to see a plot that ends with a big misunderstanding that a bunch of people just have to stop and talk about because I hate watching that.

314
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,467
Rym: I hate seeing it.

315
00:17:15,487 --> 00:17:16,898
Rym: I hate anticipating it.

316
00:17:17,622 --> 00:17:22,459
Rym: One of the best things you can do to get me interested in media is to set that up and then not do it.

317
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,099
Rym: Like, uh, not to bring up ponies, that episode with Rarity and Canterlot.

318
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,800
Scott: I'll use a non-pony example.

319
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,071
Scott: All right.

320
00:17:31,001 --> 00:17:34,879
Scott: Is Kentro meets, uh, what's-his-face, the blind guy.

321
00:17:35,283 --> 00:17:35,678
Scott: Oh, yeah.

322
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:43,400
Scott: And he thinks he's a bad guy, and so Kentro has a misunderstanding and he's sort of fighting him, but then Kentro realizes the guy isn't fighting to kill.

323
00:17:43,881 --> 00:17:45,857
Scott: And he's like, "Oh, you're actually a good

324
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:46,099
Scott: guy.".

325
00:17:46,301 --> 00:17:47,860
Rym: They didn't make it this long, drawn-out...

326
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,091
Scott: They didn't make it this long, drawn-out thing of, "I must fight you.

327
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,038
Rym: Oh, you were good guys the whole

328
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:53,680
Rym: time.".

329
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,462
Rym: You know what it is?

330
00:17:54,863 --> 00:18:02,580
Rym: If I, as the viewer, figure it out, and the characters don't figure it out for the majority of a scene or show, then I really get pissed off.

331
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:03,300
Scott: If it's obvious.

332
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:03,748
Scott: Yeah.

333
00:18:04,424 --> 00:18:05,239
Scott: Anyway, so yeah, bad.

334
00:18:06,482 --> 00:18:07,339
Scott: So... I, Vampire.

335
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,583
Rym: I, Vampire.

336
00:18:08,603 --> 00:18:12,780
Rym: I'm assuming that these characters have all this history that I don't know about.

337
00:18:13,562 --> 00:18:14,158
Scott: Something like that.

338
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:17,732
Rym: As far as I can tell, the plot is weepy.

339
00:18:17,772 --> 00:18:19,600
Rym: vampire wants to kill all humans.

340
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,622
Scott: Yeah.

341
00:18:22,324 --> 00:18:26,280
Scott: So, the art, I gotta give the art credit for being different from other art, but...

342
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,520
Rym: Yeah, but it reminded me so much of every White Wolf story ever.

343
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:36,580
Scott: I did not like this art, though, even though, like, I give them credit for being different from the other superhero comics, but I is not a fan.

344
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,240
Scott: Pretty much everything was two colors.

345
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:42,179
Scott: Gray and different gray and black, and that's it.

346
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,227
Rym: And, I don't know, the plot was just like some White Wolf.

347
00:18:45,287 --> 00:18:47,834
Rym: I don't know if that's the plot of whoever these characters are.

348
00:18:47,914 --> 00:18:48,757
Rym: I don't know their names.

349
00:18:48,977 --> 00:18:49,820
Rym: I haven't even read this.

350
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,778
Scott: Also, dude, vampires, you know, this is in the DC Universe, right?

351
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:55,360
Scott: Right?

352
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:56,259
Rym: I guess.

353
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:01,819
Scott: There's no way any vampire, even Dracula, is gonna do anything in a universe...

354
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,300
Rym: With Superman, the Green Lanterns...

355
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:03,981
Scott: Right.

356
00:19:04,282 --> 00:19:08,080
Scott: If there's actually vampires and they're actually trying to bite everyone, like I said...

357
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,799
Rym: What about Frankenstein, Agent of Shade, though?

358
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,569
Scott: Superman would just punch them all in the head, and that would be it.

359
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:15,779
Scott: And, you know, you toss vampires into the vacuum of space...

360
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,384
Rym: Well, speaking of which, 'cause you know what?

361
00:19:17,525 --> 00:19:22,360
Rym: I think we can just say bad and move on, because Justice League Dark had the same problem.

362
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,120
Rym: But they got around it by saying that magic is more...

363
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,327
Scott: Well, first, did you put I, vampires... Bad.

364
00:19:27,641 --> 00:19:28,011
Scott: Bad?

365
00:19:28,052 --> 00:19:28,319
Scott: Okay.

366
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,011
Scott: So, I didn't think it was 100% bad.

367
00:19:32,032 --> 00:19:33,720
Scott: I gave it points for doing different arts.

368
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,340
Rym: Yeah, but I just didn't like the story.

369
00:19:37,181 --> 00:19:38,685
Scott: So, Justice League Dark, right?

370
00:19:38,705 --> 00:19:43,380
Scott: So, what you got here is they've actually taken a bunch of characters from Vertigo Comics, right?

371
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,820
Scott: So, you got, you know, like Madame Xanadu's in here, right?

372
00:19:48,381 --> 00:19:49,960
Rym: I don't know who any of those characters are.

373
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,580
Scott: John Constantine, I think, is in here.

374
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,840
Rym: Other than him, because there was a movie.

375
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:53,638
Scott: Right, I think.

376
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,539
Scott: Yeah, he's in there.

377
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,221
Scott: He's in there, right?

378
00:19:55,562 --> 00:20:04,680
Scott: So, it's like, oh, they sort of brought in these magical characters all together to make sort of a magic wizardy, you know, dark wizard Justice League.

379
00:20:04,782 --> 00:20:06,452
Rym: Yeah, but... One...

380
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,259
Scott: The art is kind of colorful and nice.

381
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:13,460
Rym: The fact that they had to do this whole thing of showing you, look, Superman can't deal with this.

382
00:20:13,827 --> 00:20:13,933
Scott: Yeah.

383
00:20:15,223 --> 00:20:16,360
Rym: They almost died.

384
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:22,140
Scott: Yeah, it's the typical thing where it's like, oh, there's something that only magicians can handle.

385
00:20:22,943 --> 00:20:25,360
Rym: Yeah, or the Green Lantern Corps, I guess, to come down and fix this.

386
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:25,837
Scott: That's for sure.

387
00:20:26,461 --> 00:20:30,519
Rym: But two, what bothered me is that they had, like, all these paranormal events all happening at the same time.

388
00:20:31,142 --> 00:20:34,680
Rym: One, they all, I guess, are caused by this witch in the envelope.

389
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:40,240
Rym: And two, they really had too many of those things.

390
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:40,940
Scott: Yep.

391
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:46,580
Rym: They listed, they went through so many, like, a cow gave birth to a meat slicing machine.

392
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:49,259
Rym: One of the farmers who saw it shot himself.

393
00:20:50,222 --> 00:20:51,559
Rym: There's, like, ten of those.

394
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,600
Scott: Yeah, also, why did the real superhero show up?

395
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,960
Scott: It's like, ugh, really?

396
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,060
Scott: It's like, you know, you gotta bring the regular Justice League into Justice League.

397
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:06,640
Rym: They're torn apart by those teeth, and they cut away, and then all you get is one- That was actually very Madoka-esque witch kind of scene.

398
00:21:06,903 --> 00:21:07,159
Rym: It was.

399
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,100
Scott: But, you know, it didn't make the story any better.

400
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,780
Rym: But then you get this one line or later where someone's like, yeah, Superman and them almost didn't survive.

401
00:21:14,344 --> 00:21:14,728
Rym: And that's it.

402
00:21:14,748 --> 00:21:15,860
Rym: That's all you get.

403
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:16,271
Scott: Yeah.

404
00:21:16,681 --> 00:21:18,079
Scott: Also, I was disappointed yet again.

405
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,519
Scott: Every time I see Superman, I'm looking for- Action Comics Superman.

406
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,860
Scott: The Action Comics Jumping Superman, and you're getting the Flying Superman.

407
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,332
Scott: I'm like, ah.

408
00:21:27,304 --> 00:21:30,680
Rym: But this- even calling it Justice League Dark.

409
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,039
Rym: I mean, really?

410
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:32,680
Scott: Yeah.

411
00:21:32,942 --> 00:21:33,819
Rym: You're calling it that?

412
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,680
Rym: It's like, I'm doing Green Arrow and Green Arrow Dark.

413
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:42,920
Scott: It's like- It's gonna be the same, but all, like- Why couldn't you just call it, like, you know, magic something something.

414
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,515
Scott: I don't know.

415
00:21:44,282 --> 00:21:45,100
Scott: Come up with a new name for it.

416
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:45,560
Rym: I don't know.

417
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:50,817
Rym: It just, it was, it seemed so forced and simultaneously kind of bad.

418
00:21:53,064 --> 00:21:53,896
Scott: What are you, a Mayor bad?

419
00:21:54,661 --> 00:21:55,339
Scott: I'm giving it bad.

420
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:56,158
Scott: I give it low med.

421
00:21:56,321 --> 00:21:58,579
Rym: I don't know who any of those characters are, for one.

422
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,597
Scott: Yeah, I guess because I knew some of them.

423
00:22:01,581 --> 00:22:03,400
Scott: That's sort of, you know, and the art was so good.

424
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,680
Rym: The supernatural aspect was so forced.

425
00:22:06,101 --> 00:22:06,840
Rym: It was super forced.

426
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,477
Rym: Am I supposed to know who that witch is?

427
00:22:09,608 --> 00:22:09,778
Scott: Yeah.

428
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,139
Rym: So, alright.

429
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,516
Rym: It doesn't tell you who it is.

430
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,087
Rym: No.

431
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,259
Rym: So thanks, comic book.

432
00:22:15,422 --> 00:22:16,420
Rym: Thanks for giving me nothing.

433
00:22:16,761 --> 00:22:17,194
Scott: Alright, so.

434
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,040
Scott: Savage Hawkman.

435
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:21,518
Scott: I don't know why.

436
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,958
Rym: I've seen- Why is this a comic?

437
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,500
Scott: Well, like, I don't know what the deal is with Hawkman.

438
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,900
Rym: Like, I see Hawkman all over the place.

439
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,880
Rym: Is Savage Hawkman different from Hawkman?

440
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,120
Scott: No, he's just, it's the Hawkman.

441
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,959
Rym: This already started with him, you know, like, throwing away the Hawkman suit that I guess was his.

442
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,240
Scott: Yeah, like, I don't get Hawkman.

443
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,215
Scott: He's a dude who has a weird suit with wings and a mace.

444
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,180
Rym: No, it's made out of the, it's made out of the oomph metal.

445
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,740
Scott: But isn't he, like, an alien or something, Hawkman?

446
00:22:45,122 --> 00:22:46,440
Rym: No, the metal is alien.

447
00:22:46,581 --> 00:22:47,580
Rym: The oomph metal.

448
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,900
Scott: So Hawkman's a regular dude.

449
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,700
Rym: He's a regular dude, as far as I can guess.

450
00:22:50,781 --> 00:22:53,640
Scott: I thought he was this thing, I thought he was from some other planet, like.

451
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:58,937
Rym: So Scott, I am basing all of my cosmology of the Savage Hawkman on this one comic I read.

452
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:10,480
Rym: And in this comic, there is a man, normal dude, who was the Hawkman because he had a suit made out of the oomph metal, and when he burned the oomph metal suit, it exploded and turned him again into the Hawkman.

453
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:15,518
Scott: So the art, at least in the beginning part, was way awesome, especially the dude being set on fire.

454
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,620
Scott: Oh, the art was great.

455
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:22,340
Scott: Oh man, that was, it was just, like, a lot of these books, it's like, wow, they actually brought out some pretty good artists.

456
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,857
Scott: I wonder if the fanboys like these arts as much as I like them.

457
00:23:26,925 --> 00:23:27,700
Scott: Here's another question.

458
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,733
Scott: So there's this archaeologist going on here, right, and they're trying to dig up some alien shit.

459
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:32,313
Rym: Yup.

460
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:42,859
Scott: Why are there archaeologists in a world with Superman who can x-ray vision the whole world and can just fly out into outer space and find out anything you have to know about alien history?

461
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:43,538
Rym: Why, yeah.

462
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:49,720
Scott: Archaeology is completely unnecessary in a world with superheroes who can go into space and fly faster than the speed of light.

463
00:23:49,720 --> 00:24:04,117
Rym: In a world where there is also a long history of epic space battles, I mean, we know from the one of the Green Lanterns, no, not from Green Lantern, from Blue Beetle, that when the Mayans were around, that one Green Lantern guy was out there doing the Green Lantern bullshit.

464
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,120
Scott: Yeah, but the point is, archaeology is obsolete in a world of superheroes.

465
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,799
Rym: No, you have archaeological experts who tell the superheroes what to do.

466
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:19,520
Scott: You just know, you just have superheroes who have already done all the archaeology in about two days, and then the other guys would just be studying all the stuff that was 100% dug up and discovered.

467
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:35,879
Rym: Yeah, but that aside, I don't have any motivation to care about the Hawkman, and because, clearly, the comic book decided that it didn't need to tell me anything that was going on, I had no idea what was going on.

468
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:42,700
Scott: This also reminded me of Independence Day, where they got that cocoon there, and it's sort of like the peace, no peace kind of situation.

469
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,420
Rym: Is this class bulletproof?

470
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:48,760
Rym: Yeah, this is- See that college humor, where the guy's like, "Yes, it is," and then they shoot anyway, and then they get hit with a ricochet.

471
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:49,520
Rym: He's like, "What the fuck?

472
00:24:49,802 --> 00:24:50,270
Rym: I said it was

473
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:50,758
Rym: bulletproof!".

474
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,420
Scott: Bulletproof glass doesn't ricochet, though.

475
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,120
Scott: The bullets just get stuck in it, right?

476
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:54,480
Rym: I know.

477
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,180
Rym: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

478
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:59,297
Scott: Anyway, and then, also, this is one of those cases of, "I hit you, little

479
00:24:59,317 --> 00:24:59,658
Scott: guy.".

480
00:25:00,201 --> 00:25:01,480
Scott: Yeah, there was a lot of that going on.

481
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,480
Scott: Always minus points, but you get mad because your arts are awesome.

482
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,338
Scott: What are you going to give it?

483
00:25:09,751 --> 00:25:10,099
Rym: I don't know.

484
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,600
Rym: I got to give it a meh minus.

485
00:25:11,981 --> 00:25:12,539
Scott: Meh minus?

486
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:12,980
Rym: Okay.

487
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:19,619
Rym: Because, like you said, the art is really good, but the story, one- I don't know anything about the Hawkman, so it makes no sense.

488
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:25,899
Rym: I wonder if it would be slightly better if I knew, but I pretended, like, what if I knew what all these things were?

489
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,540
Rym: The story still wasn't that compelling.

490
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:27,913
Scott: No.

491
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,920
Scott: All right, so, regular old Superman.

492
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,300
Rym: Wasn't action comic Superman, would not buy from again.

493
00:25:35,542 --> 00:25:36,500
Scott: That's pretty much what he got.

494
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,680
Scott: It wasn't the Superman I want.

495
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:42,180
Scott: So, first of all, it's like, the Daily Planet is bigger than the New York Times.

496
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,140
Scott: Does the internet exist in this world, right?

497
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:45,952
Scott: It's like, "Are you kidding

498
00:25:45,993 --> 00:25:46,095
Scott: me?".

499
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,030
Scott: It's like, "How is the Daily Planet-".

500
00:25:48,331 --> 00:25:53,638
Rym: And how come they- I guess they feel like the only way to keep Superman fresh is to make the Daily Planet start to turn into a rag?

501
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:54,472
Scott: Yeah.

502
00:25:54,820 --> 00:26:01,459
Scott: It's like, obviously, they were trying to make this social commentary, but you failed because you were too overt and not subtle at all.

503
00:26:01,742 --> 00:26:01,828
Rym: Yeah.

504
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:02,520
Scott: Right?

505
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:11,520
Scott: And it's like, you know, why didn't, you know, Superman just save the old globe instead of just letting it fall?

506
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,820
Scott: Like, he could have just taken it and put it in a museum.

507
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,399
Scott: He's Superman.

508
00:26:14,601 --> 00:26:15,392
Rym: Who's going to stop him?

509
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:20,619
Rym: And put it in space in an orbit and left it there until someone asked for him to give it to them to do something with it.

510
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,100
Rym: And then he could have gone out and got it and brought it back.

511
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,059
Scott: If there's a thing you care about and you're Superman, no one can fuck it up for you.

512
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,880
Rym: The Superman just had no personality.

513
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,000
Rym: Action Comics Superman has personality.

514
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:31,898
Rym: Where is that guy?

515
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,537
Scott: Oh, the thing that bothered me the most of the whole book- The most.

516
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:44,220
Scott: The most, I don't know if you remember this, right, is if you go to, uh, what page was this fucking thing on, right?

517
00:26:44,806 --> 00:26:45,898
Scott: Oh, God, I'm going to find it.

518
00:26:46,901 --> 00:26:50,538
Rym: I'm wondering if I'm thinking the same thing, but I don't want to say anything until you show me the page.

519
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,140
Rym: All right.

520
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:53,557
Rym: So what?

521
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:59,617
Scott: So there's this random page in the middle that has nothing to do with anything- The guy blowing the horn!

522
00:27:00,361 --> 00:27:03,300
Scott: It's just like you're reading this book and this stuff, Superman stuff happening.

523
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:09,678
Scott: Then there's a page and there's a guy, there's a crazy alien blowing this weird ass fucking horn.

524
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,579
Scott: And it has that note.

525
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,379
Rym: It's like, want to know more about this mystery?

526
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,540
Scott: Because for more on this mystery, you see Stormwatch number one, and then it just goes back to Superman.

527
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:22,300
Scott: That horn blowing has nothing to do with anything else in any page in this book.

528
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,099
Scott: It is a random page of an alien blowing a horn.

529
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,700
Rym: And two, it's not a mystery anymore if I read that other comic.

530
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:33,280
Scott: Yeah, it's like, uh, we had Stormwatch number one.

531
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:35,079
Scott: I read it already, didn't we?

532
00:27:35,663 --> 00:27:37,079
Rym: I don't remember that in Stormwatch.

533
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,060
Scott: I don't know what the fuck this alien blowing a horn has to do with Stormwatch.

534
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:50,360
Scott: I mean, maybe I'll go back and check it out, but why did you- it's like they took a page out of Stormwatch, ripped it out, and just shoved it in a Superman book, just randomly in the middle for no reason.

535
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,940
Rym: Probably to get you to read Stormwatch.

536
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:55,116
Rym: I know the plots are going to collide, but again, DC, why you do this?

537
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,120
Rym: This is what I hate about comics.

538
00:27:58,262 --> 00:28:00,598
Scott: And there's more subtle ways you could have done it.

539
00:28:02,321 --> 00:28:11,660
Scott: Maybe not even have the Stormwatch comic, and then maybe sort of introduce a plot where Stormwatch has to deal with Superman somehow, and then sort of bring it around back.

540
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:24,560
Rym: There's a lot of ways they could have done it, but the only thing I like about Superman right now is either the Superman in Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns, or the action comic Superman.

541
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,179
Rym: If this is neither, I don't care.

542
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,800
Rym: And it just heaped insults upon those already weak foundations.

543
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,780
Rym: I'd give it a bed.

544
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,419
Scott: I would have given it meh, but that horn page brings it down.

545
00:28:36,641 --> 00:28:38,778
Scott: Brings it down into bad territory.

546
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,465
Rym: So not to bring in stuff.

547
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:46,518
Rym: I know about other stuff, but Teen Titans, that's not the Teen Titans.

548
00:28:47,362 --> 00:28:47,979
Rym: Who are these people?

549
00:28:48,542 --> 00:28:51,180
Scott: I don't know much about Teen Titans at all, really.

550
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:55,020
Rym: I know there was the mediocre cartoon, and that's all I know, and you know what?

551
00:28:55,141 --> 00:28:56,080
Rym: This wasn't the same people.

552
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,920
Scott: So you've got this super boy, right?

553
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,279
Scott: Is he super boy or is he not?

554
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,100
Scott: Because isn't super boy the astro boy?

555
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:02,880
Rym: Yes, the astro boy and super boy.

556
00:29:03,186 --> 00:29:03,798
Scott: So who's this guy?

557
00:29:04,183 --> 00:29:04,880
Rym: Fuck if I know.

558
00:29:05,062 --> 00:29:06,560
Scott: So he's super kid, super dude.

559
00:29:06,802 --> 00:29:07,256
Rym: I don't know.

560
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,540
Scott: Other super boy, super boy two, super whatever.

561
00:29:10,845 --> 00:29:15,320
Rym: And then- Remember, Queen Tits and Ass is supposed to be in the Teen Titans, but she's not.

562
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,420
Rym: She's in Tits and Ass, the comic book.

563
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,480
Scott: You've got Kid Flash, who I sort of know.

564
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,118
Scott: That makes sense.

565
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:20,980
Scott: Yeah, I don't know who that is.

566
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:21,740
Scott: You got Robin.

567
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,699
Scott: Which one of the four Robins is this?

568
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,920
Rym: I'm pretty sure this is the one.

569
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,240
Scott: The one who takes it in the ass or the one who sucks Batman's dick?

570
00:29:27,301 --> 00:29:28,560
Rym: This is like Red Robin or something.

571
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,779
Rym: It's like yet another Robin.

572
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:30,560
Scott: Is it different?

573
00:29:31,063 --> 00:29:32,540
Scott: Was he not ever a regular Robin?

574
00:29:32,661 --> 00:29:33,052
Scott: I don't know.

575
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,620
Scott: Was he only a Red Robin or was he a real, plain old Robin at some point?

576
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,879
Rym: I don't know and it doesn't tell you.

577
00:29:40,222 --> 00:29:44,960
Rym: I watched the cartoon a little bit and it was just Robin and the cyborg guy.

578
00:29:46,402 --> 00:29:47,740
Rym: I don't know who these people are.

579
00:29:48,303 --> 00:29:50,720
Scott: And then you've got Wonder Girl, right?

580
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,051
Scott: And the weirdest part for me was Wonder Girl says, "Wonder

581
00:29:54,091 --> 00:29:54,252
Scott: Girl."

582
00:29:56,641 --> 00:29:57,146
Scott: It's like,

583
00:29:57,631 --> 00:29:57,792
Scott: "What?".

584
00:29:58,661 --> 00:30:02,540
Scott: You say- You know, it's like you don't say your weird name.

585
00:30:02,641 --> 00:30:04,760
Scott: No one goes around saying their own weird-ass name.

586
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:10,186
Rym: I kind of like the dynamic between the Robin and Wonder Girl because she's like, "Don't call me

587
00:30:10,207 --> 00:30:10,371
Rym: that.".

588
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:13,580
Rym: And then he's like, "I can block these bullets.

589
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,034
Rym: You're on your

590
00:30:14,076 --> 00:30:14,159
Rym: own.".

591
00:30:14,201 --> 00:30:14,820
Rym: She's like, "Whatever.

592
00:30:15,163 --> 00:30:15,408
Rym: I got

593
00:30:15,449 --> 00:30:15,857
Rym: magics.".

594
00:30:16,061 --> 00:30:16,755
Rym: And he's like, "Whoa, you got

595
00:30:16,775 --> 00:30:17,020
Rym: magic.".

596
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:17,633
Rym: And she's like, "Shut

597
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:17,776
Rym: up.".

598
00:30:18,045 --> 00:30:18,340
Scott: Oh, no, wait.

599
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:28,260
Scott: I think that the Superboy is the Astro Boy Superboy because if you look on the final two pages, it's that girl with the orange hair who was cool and then released the Superboy.

600
00:30:28,962 --> 00:30:34,277
Rym: I was holding my notes in my hand and actually looked, but what I wrote was, "Oh, Superboy is here.

601
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,106
Rym: I wonder

602
00:30:35,188 --> 00:30:35,492
Rym: why.".

603
00:30:36,261 --> 00:30:39,780
Rym: Basically, I was complaining that, yet again, they're mixing all my comics up.

604
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,640
Scott: Also, The Enemy was an evil acronym organization.

605
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,099
Scott: Of course.

606
00:30:44,203 --> 00:30:49,099
Scott: And I think at some point someone made a joke about Robin being homeschooled, and I was like, "Haha.

607
00:30:49,221 --> 00:30:50,459
Scott: He does act homeschooled.

608
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:50,990
Scott: Wait.

609
00:30:51,181 --> 00:30:51,972
Scott: All these people act

610
00:30:51,992 --> 00:30:52,479
Scott: homeschooled.".

611
00:30:54,583 --> 00:30:57,380
Scott: Okay, so that Superboy is the Astro Boy Superboy, but it's like, "No, wait.

612
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,832
Scott: Why are they releasing the Astro Boy Superboy in a comic?

613
00:30:59,852 --> 00:31:00,334
Scott: that's not the

614
00:31:00,374 --> 00:31:00,877
Scott: Superboy?".

615
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,220
Rym: I give it a mad just because it's not as bad as all the things I've said are bad.

616
00:31:06,221 --> 00:31:09,120
Rym: I didn't like it, but I didn't particularly dislike it.

617
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,260
Scott: I actually gave it bad because there was absolutely nothing.

618
00:31:12,541 --> 00:31:16,125
Scott: The other ones that I gave mad, it was like, "Oh, there was amazing art, but there was nothing

619
00:31:16,146 --> 00:31:16,412
Scott: doing.".

620
00:31:17,381 --> 00:31:19,414
Scott: This, it was just nothing doing across the board.

621
00:31:20,801 --> 00:31:22,571
Scott: There wasn't one awesome thing to say.

622
00:31:22,611 --> 00:31:24,200
Scott: there was an awesome thing to push it up into mad.

623
00:31:24,361 --> 00:31:27,877
Rym: I guess I kind of enjoyed some of the banter, and the dialogue wasn't that bad.

624
00:31:29,265 --> 00:31:31,540
Scott: I did comment about the, "You were homeschooled" part.

625
00:31:32,202 --> 00:31:38,499
Scott: It was a little better than others in the dialogue department, but still not good dialogue, just better than the others.

626
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,079
Rym: By this point in the slog, it didn't take much to impress me.

627
00:31:42,368 --> 00:31:43,060
Scott: It's all relative.

628
00:31:43,562 --> 00:31:43,939
Rym: All right.

629
00:31:44,442 --> 00:31:46,299
Scott: We're finally at the end of our slog.

630
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:46,845
Rym: Voodoo.

631
00:31:48,522 --> 00:31:48,897
Rym: Voodoo.

632
00:31:50,005 --> 00:31:50,171
Scott: AKA.

633
00:31:50,647 --> 00:31:50,836
Scott: TNA.

634
00:31:51,624 --> 00:31:54,757
Rym: Not only TNA, but let's have- Tnist Aonist.

635
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:07,920
Rym: The majority of this comic take place in a strip club and keep showing all the strippers and play to the stereotype that all the strippers are in fact working moms and college girls just trying to get by, and that is totally not sleazy.

636
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:19,720
Rym: This is like, it's almost like misogyny trying to pretend it's not misogynistic by stereotyping misogyny and then trying to cast it in a good light.

637
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,859
Scott: So the art, I thought the art was actually kind of, it was cool that they tried to do something different, right?

638
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,619
Scott: But it looks like a high quality kamipo.

639
00:32:28,081 --> 00:32:28,479
Rym: Yeah, it does.

640
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,799
Scott: So it's not actually good, but I give them points for doing something different and minus points for doing a bad job.

641
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,479
Scott: The cover was a little- Minus points for TNA.

642
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,539
Rym: The cover was a little- The cover doesn't fit.

643
00:32:38,844 --> 00:32:40,340
Scott: And then here's the notes that I wrote down.

644
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:40,615
Scott: You ready?

645
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:41,714
Rym: Boobs.

646
00:32:42,463 --> 00:32:43,139
Scott: Nice setup.

647
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,255
Scott: Boobs.

648
00:32:45,085 --> 00:32:45,979
Rym: It was all boobs.

649
00:32:46,524 --> 00:32:46,996
Scott: All boobs.

650
00:32:47,562 --> 00:32:48,259
Rym: Nothing but boobs.

651
00:32:48,421 --> 00:32:53,480
Rym: I did not, the first time I read it, I did not actually catch that it was the same guy.

652
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,579
Rym: Like I didn't notice that that guy was back.

653
00:32:56,601 --> 00:32:57,339
Scott: Oh, you didn't notice that?

654
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,739
Rym: Because he was drawn derpily.

655
00:32:59,784 --> 00:32:59,976
Rym: Kind of.

656
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,319
Rym: Like his face went off model.

657
00:33:02,345 --> 00:33:03,300
Scott: I didn't notice that much.

658
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,320
Rym: Like I didn't notice it was him.

659
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,474
Rym: I read it again, I was like, "Oh wait, it's the same

660
00:33:05,515 --> 00:33:05,799
Rym: guy.".

661
00:33:06,162 --> 00:33:08,638
Rym: I don't know if I just didn't read those last pages the first time I read it.

662
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,020
Rym: But seriously, they're all strippers.

663
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:22,660
Rym: You focus on strippers and sex, the whole comic, and you like go out of your way to talk about how all the strippers are totally cool and totally okay with being strippers.

664
00:33:23,162 --> 00:33:26,680
Rym: and they're just like, you know, working moms, trying to get by, trying to make do.

665
00:33:27,181 --> 00:33:30,339
Scott: Yeah, no, but I mean it's, the thing is, is like you're like, "Oh, it's the same

666
00:33:30,379 --> 00:33:30,480
Scott: guy.".

667
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,838
Scott: It's because Voodoo turned into the guy.

668
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:32,189
Rym: Yeah.

669
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:32,660
Rym: Yeah.

670
00:33:32,861 --> 00:33:34,339
Rym: But then Voodoo also walked away.

671
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:38,180
Scott: I think she's basically just like the thing, you know, the thing from another world or whatever.

672
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,020
Rym: Maybe she's bad at it, so she was off, that was why he was off model.

673
00:33:41,165 --> 00:33:41,497
Rym: I don't know.

674
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:42,200
Scott: I don't know.

675
00:33:42,361 --> 00:33:43,319
Scott: I gave it man.

676
00:33:44,042 --> 00:33:45,940
Rym: I gave it bad because I just didn't care.

677
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:46,538
Scott: Yeah.

678
00:33:47,422 --> 00:33:49,839
Scott: All right, so that concludes this.

679
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,699
Scott: I hope this helps somebody even though it's a thousand years late.

680
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,540
Scott: Just sort of summary things.

681
00:33:57,461 --> 00:34:02,540
Rym: I think we can sum it up by pointing out that it took us this long to do this and I was really excited.

682
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,132
Rym: Like, it's only 52 single issue comics.

683
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:10,777
Rym: I'm going to read them all with an open mind and I liked some of them, but it became such a slog.

684
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:19,558
Rym: Like the ones that I didn't like, I would put to the back of the pile and then I'd gotten through all the ones I liked and I had this gigantic pile of comics that I did not want to read.

685
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:20,359
Scott: 52 comics.

686
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,059
Scott: That's a lot of different comics.

687
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:22,536
Scott: I know.

688
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:25,719
Scott: But it's like so many of them were just the same shit.

689
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:31,062
Rym: I mean, all the Green Lanterns blurred together to where I really, the only ones that stood out was.

690
00:34:31,404 --> 00:34:38,760
Rym: there was Green Lanterny bullshit and then separate from that there was Green Lanterny bullshit where the evil looking guy is in space brooding.

691
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:53,000
Scott: See, what I would do if I was them, right, is it's like, okay, obviously if I was them I would throw out the whole thing and make a completely new way of doing things, but just to make, you know, if you're going to keep things the way they're doing it, but you know, just make slight modifications to improve, right?

692
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:58,149
Scott: What I would do is all this Batman stuff, you really got to sort it out and have there be just one Batman.

693
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,617
Rym: Here's what I would do.

694
00:35:00,044 --> 00:35:01,099
Rym: I'd have all the different Batmans.

695
00:35:01,801 --> 00:35:05,160
Rym: I'd make the equivalent of Shonen Jump, but it's just Batman Jump.

696
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:06,859
Rym: It's just like.

697
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,680
Scott: Well, that's changing the whole world, right?

698
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:29,236
Scott: I'm talking about just the slight change, which is, you know, get rid of all these different Batman comics, like Batman Dark, Batman Light, Batman Purple, Batman this, and just make the one comic Batman and release four issues every month, Batman one, two, three, four, and month two, five, six, seven, eight, and if you have to, make them bigger with more pages like a 48 page.

699
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,614
Rym: Or, or, or if you have to, have a second Batman.

700
00:35:31,674 --> 00:35:32,520
Rym: that is no story.

701
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,300
Rym: Every one off is a one off story.

702
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:44,540
Scott: So there's the one off story, B-Task, and then there's the other one that is Batman, Hell, just make more B-TAS in comic form.

703
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:55,360
Rym: That style of Batman is my second favorite, third favorite after the original Frank Miller Dark Knight Returns and Michael Keaton Batman, which nobody else likes.

704
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:58,619
Scott: You know, numbers wise, I wrote, I got to put this spreadsheet out there.

705
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,394
Scott: So you know, most of the comics had 21 pages of content.

706
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:13,420
Scott: I counted the cover as content that you had around, you know, four or five, six, seven pages of ads, but actually the number of ads went up over the weeks.

707
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,760
Scott: Like the early weeks had like four or five, six pages.

708
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,020
Scott: The later weeks had seven, eight, nine ad pages.

709
00:36:18,463 --> 00:36:19,899
Rym: I wonder if they thought we wouldn't notice.

710
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,780
Scott: Well, I think part of it also was that they had house ads, right?

711
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,100
Scott: The house ads are the ads for other DC shit.

712
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:31,500
Scott: So the house ads started off as like 10 house ads for all 14 pages of house ads, right?

713
00:36:31,905 --> 00:36:32,879
Scott: And they went down.

714
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:42,099
Scott: So they, over the weeks, over these four weeks, at least of starting, they had more house ads in the beginning and they replaced them with paid ads as time went on.

715
00:36:43,782 --> 00:36:47,480
Scott: And yeah, charging three bucks for any one of these is a ridiculous amount of money.

716
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:52,584
Scott: Think about this for one of these flimsy ass things that gives you only 21 pages of story.

717
00:36:52,645 --> 00:36:54,240
Scott: That's pretty much a disposable thing.

718
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,359
Scott: You read it once and chuck it.

719
00:36:55,881 --> 00:37:01,127
Scott: You could get three one dollar iPhone games that you'll probably play every day on the subway.

720
00:37:01,187 --> 00:37:02,039
Rym: Three Angry Birds.

721
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:02,741
Scott: Yeah.

722
00:37:03,364 --> 00:37:06,340
Scott: You're telling me that this Batman is worth three Angry Birds?

723
00:37:06,502 --> 00:37:07,680
Scott: Are you crazy?

724
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:14,656
Rym: The only I mean, maybe Animal Man, just because if that was the only way to read it, I kind of want to read it.

725
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,119
Scott: Yeah, but it's not worth that many.

726
00:37:17,461 --> 00:37:17,904
Scott: Yeah.

727
00:37:18,328 --> 00:37:19,860
Scott: And it's like, oh, my God, it's unbelievable.

728
00:37:20,122 --> 00:37:21,620
Scott: And some of these are four dollars.

729
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:26,220
Scott: All Star Western was a longer book with more pages at twenty nine pages of content.

730
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:26,647
Scott: Guess what?

731
00:37:26,708 --> 00:37:27,339
Scott: Four dollars.

732
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:35,279
Scott: It's like, wait, you only added eight more pages of content, you know, over the twenty one that were already in the other ones.

733
00:37:35,601 --> 00:37:42,140
Scott: And you added a whole extra dollar, a thirty three percent price increase for a less than thirty three percent content increase.

734
00:37:42,364 --> 00:37:43,199
Scott: That is not cool.

735
00:37:45,061 --> 00:37:50,479
Scott: So the pricing is all fucked up, but everyone knows that most of them were bad or mad, but hey, most of everything is crap.

736
00:37:50,641 --> 00:37:54,160
Rym: But in our opinion, I mean, I know there are people who love the shit out of all of them.

737
00:37:54,181 --> 00:37:59,080
Scott: Well, if you're the kind of person who loves the shit out of us, you know what we think and you know that you disagree with us.

738
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,979
Rym: No, didn't you know that you like it?

739
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,700
Rym: Didn't some of these already get canceled by the time we finished all this?

740
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,185
Scott: Yeah, I'm not sure exactly which ones were canceled because you keep going through your statistics.

741
00:38:07,226 --> 00:38:08,259
Rym: I'll find out which ones got canceled.

742
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,479
Scott: I think Omak was canceled and stuff like that.

743
00:38:11,001 --> 00:38:11,578
Rym: Oh, right.

744
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,404
Rym: Oh, man.

745
00:38:12,686 --> 00:38:14,720
Scott: Yeah, that would be the Jack Kirby-esque one.

746
00:38:15,021 --> 00:38:15,751
Rym: Oh, my God.

747
00:38:15,772 --> 00:38:16,299
Scott: It was pretty bad.

748
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:19,460
Scott: But, you know, all in all, there were some good ones.

749
00:38:19,621 --> 00:38:23,042
Scott: If you make if you throw enough shit against the wall, you're going to have some golds, right?

750
00:38:23,063 --> 00:38:23,759
Scott: You know, Animal Man.

751
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:24,202
Scott: Great.

752
00:38:25,211 --> 00:38:26,300
Scott: The action comic Superman.

753
00:38:26,561 --> 00:38:26,802
Scott: Great.

754
00:38:27,425 --> 00:38:30,820
Scott: You know, there were some of these comics in here that we kind of liked.

755
00:38:30,902 --> 00:38:31,474
Scott: Aquaman.

756
00:38:31,637 --> 00:38:31,780
Scott: Right.

757
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,659
Scott: Totally cool and awesome jerk guy.

758
00:38:35,343 --> 00:38:38,200
Scott: You know, All-Star Western kind of OK-ish, right?

759
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:43,503
Scott: It's like, you know, not all these comics were absolutely awful.

760
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:47,962
Scott: There are some that are worth reading and they'll probably be paying for the trade.

761
00:38:48,524 --> 00:38:55,160
Rym: Well, there is a whole section in the Wikipedia article on the New 52 on accusations of sexism.

762
00:38:58,912 --> 00:38:59,399
Scott: How about that?

763
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:00,501
Rym: Wow.

764
00:39:00,944 --> 00:39:03,018
Rym: Yeah, there's a lot of information here.

765
00:39:05,283 --> 00:39:06,520
Rym: Doesn't say which ones got canceled.

766
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,520
Scott: Did you press control F and type the word cancel?

767
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,181
Rym: Not yet.

768
00:39:13,778 --> 00:39:14,320
Scott: OK, here we go.

769
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,320
Scott: On January 12, 2012, DC announced that after their eighth issue.

770
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:23,300
Scott: So there's going to be eight issues of the following comics and then they will all be canceled and replace.

771
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,140
Rym: Yep, I see it with six new titles.

772
00:39:25,201 --> 00:39:26,360
Scott: So here are the ones that are going away.

773
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:32,759
Scott: Black Hawks, which was, you know, we put our logo on our truck, Hawk and Dove, which is Rob Liefeld.

774
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:34,647
Scott: Men of War.

775
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:36,200
Scott: That was the war one.

776
00:39:36,701 --> 00:39:37,284
Scott: Yeah, but at least.

777
00:39:37,324 --> 00:39:41,819
Scott: Hey, but the thing is, if there's only eight issues of it, you know, there'll be one trade and that's it.

778
00:39:41,941 --> 00:39:42,960
Scott: So it's not even a big commitment.

779
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,523
Rym: I'll read the trade.

780
00:39:43,544 --> 00:39:46,060
Scott: So you could buy that and then sell it to book off or something.

781
00:39:46,362 --> 00:39:46,730
Scott: Yeah.

782
00:39:46,791 --> 00:39:46,852
Scott: Mr.

783
00:39:46,872 --> 00:39:47,240
Scott: Terrific.

784
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:47,720
Rym: OK.

785
00:39:48,225 --> 00:39:49,700
Rym: Oh, Mac, no shock there.

786
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,180
Scott: And static shock again.

787
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,043
Rym: No shock.

788
00:39:52,405 --> 00:39:59,620
Scott: So those six title after their eighth issues, those six titles will be canceled and they're going to be six new titles.

789
00:39:59,821 --> 00:40:03,720
Rym: So six new Batman, no, five new Batman and one new Green Lanterns.

790
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,679
Scott: Should we buy the number ones of those six new?

791
00:40:06,223 --> 00:40:07,155
Rym: Oh, my God.

792
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:07,520
Scott: Right.

793
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,879
Scott: It won't be for a while.

794
00:40:09,081 --> 00:40:09,202
Scott: Right.

795
00:40:09,243 --> 00:40:11,320
Scott: The eighth issues of those ones still have to come out.

796
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,637
Scott: And then the month after that.

797
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,379
Rym: We probably should.

798
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,760
Scott: Yeah, it could be like half an episode going over just six issues.

799
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,165
Scott: Right.

800
00:40:19,129 --> 00:40:21,058
Scott: But then I feel like, well, if we're going to do that, we have to.

801
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:22,699
Scott: we should be buying Marvel number ones.

802
00:40:22,861 --> 00:40:23,062
Scott: Right.

803
00:40:23,082 --> 00:40:25,680
Scott: So I don't want to go, you know, down this huge rabbit hole.

804
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:30,171
Rym: So if we're going to do anything Marvel, you need to watch Wolverine and the X-Men so we can do a show on it.

805
00:40:30,536 --> 00:40:30,840
Scott: Sure.

806
00:40:31,021 --> 00:40:32,218
Rym: It's really good.

807
00:40:33,122 --> 00:40:33,487
Scott: Sure.

808
00:40:33,589 --> 00:40:34,279
Rym: It is really good.

809
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,719
Scott: I got other things to be doing.

810
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:41,539
Rym: I just got to point out, you know, for all the hate I get for all the a lot of these comic books, you can do superhero stuff that I'll really like.

811
00:40:42,081 --> 00:40:42,783
Scott: It's possible.

812
00:40:43,325 --> 00:40:44,650
Scott: It's very it's you know, it's just.

813
00:40:45,092 --> 00:40:47,440
Scott: you just can't do the typical shit.

814
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:52,638
Scott: I really like the superhero stuff that gets sort of like existential and weird.

815
00:40:52,939 --> 00:41:05,259
Scott: or like you remember I was talking about my idea for the Flash where he sort of has like mental problems or, you know, you make it real sci fi, like for real sci fi, the way Ghost in the Shell is for real sci fi.

816
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,003
Rym: Oh, my God.

817
00:41:06,324 --> 00:41:10,442
Rym: If they if they got some of the artists or like Demon Knight was real fantasy, right?

818
00:41:10,522 --> 00:41:17,240
Rym: It's got to take the artist who did this stuff like the good ones and make a Ghost in the Shell like color comic.

819
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:17,964
Rym: Yeah.

820
00:41:17,984 --> 00:41:20,380
Rym: That isn't just Ghost in the Shell 2.

821
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,940
Rym: Yeah, that isn't just Ghost in the Shell 2.

822
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:22,744
Scott: Right.

823
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,254
Scott: You know, or you know, you could do.

824
00:41:25,555 --> 00:41:26,600
Scott: none of these are comedies.

825
00:41:26,961 --> 00:41:27,478
Scott: Have you noticed that?

826
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,740
Rym: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Wikipedia.

827
00:41:33,162 --> 00:41:33,483
Rym: All right.

828
00:41:33,523 --> 00:41:49,174
Rym: So Keith Phillips and two people who are talking about the sexism stuff agreed with the observations on Catwoman and Red Hood and the Outlaws, quote, but opine that Voodoo was a positive example of how to incorporate a female character's sexuality as relevant aspect of the story without appearing

829
00:41:49,255 --> 00:41:49,859
Scott: exploitative.

830
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:51,829
Rym: Oh, I got.

831
00:41:51,849 --> 00:41:52,639
Rym: who said that?

832
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,238
Rym: Who said that?

833
00:41:55,461 --> 00:41:58,780
Rym: The Comics Alliance and I don't know, Keith Phillips.

834
00:41:59,261 --> 00:42:00,198
Scott: Anyway, I don't know.

835
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:00,784
Rym: Really?

836
00:42:01,006 --> 00:42:02,420
Rym: You could say that with a straight face.

837
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,057
Scott: I guess the guy believes it.

838
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:05,960
Rym: I know.

839
00:42:07,963 --> 00:42:10,680
Scott: I mean, if you tried to go argue that in some forum, there'd be a flame war.

840
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,709
Scott: What are you going to do?

841
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:12,900
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

842
00:42:13,961 --> 00:42:14,952
Scott: This is why you have a podcast.

843
00:42:15,013 --> 00:42:15,560
Scott: No replies.

844
00:42:22,213 --> 00:42:24,350
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

845
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:29,674
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

846
00:42:29,874 --> 00:42:34,934
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

847
00:42:35,155 --> 00:42:42,570
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows, SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.
