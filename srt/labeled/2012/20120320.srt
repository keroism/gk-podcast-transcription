1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,439
Rym: It's Tuesday, March 20th, 2012.

2
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:12,940
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:13,802
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,922 --> 00:00:15,545
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,586 --> 00:00:17,550
Rym: Tonight we talk about Trigger!

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,634
Rym: And the Bobo.

7
00:00:20,714 --> 00:00:21,657
Rym: Bobo.

8
00:00:21,717 --> 00:00:22,781
Rym: Bobo.

9
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:23,442
Rym: Bobo.

10
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:24,104
Rym: Bobo.

11
00:00:24,867 --> 00:00:25,890
Scott: Let's do this.

12
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,396
Rym: So I realize there might not be a big overlap here.

13
00:00:29,476 --> 00:00:34,189
Rym: So all you video game kids, there's an anime called Bobobo.

14
00:00:35,051 --> 00:00:35,773
Rym: It's Bobobo.

15
00:00:35,794 --> 00:00:36,395
Rym: Bobobo.

16
00:00:36,435 --> 00:00:37,298
Scott: No, you spelled it wrong.

17
00:00:37,398 --> 00:00:38,542
Scott: It's Bobobo.

18
00:00:38,923 --> 00:00:39,525
Scott: Bobobo.

19
00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:40,066
Scott: I'm 100% correct.

20
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,098
Rym: The important part is, there's seven bows.

21
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,009
Scott: Yeah, I'm 100% confident that that is the correct way to say it.

22
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,706
Rym: So, a Bobo is a character, and you guys know all that.

23
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:53,790
Rym: We'll talk about that at the meet.

24
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,138
Rym: I'm not gonna... It's got smat when I blow my load early.

25
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,190
Rym: So I'll wait while we're talking about Bobo's big adventure.

26
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,195
Scott: It's too late.

27
00:01:00,296 --> 00:01:00,719
Scott: It's too late.

28
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:01,242
Scott: You're done.

29
00:01:01,484 --> 00:01:02,270
Scott: You need some faggers.

30
00:01:05,752 --> 00:01:06,796
Rym: But yeah, PAX is coming.

31
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:10,070
Rym: I haven't really been paying attention to video game news or any of that stuff.

32
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,055
Scott: Pretty much paying attention to nothing but PAX.

33
00:01:12,677 --> 00:01:14,020
Rym: And it's gaming season.

34
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,610
Rym: I've been playing more PC games and more board games than anything lately.

35
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:26,370
Scott: It's definitely game season, and it's also warm, so it's biking season, so it's pretty much biking, gaming, PAXing, eating, sleeping, showering.

36
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,012
Rym: Good times.

37
00:01:27,233 --> 00:01:27,615
Scott: That's it.

38
00:01:27,856 --> 00:01:33,469
Rym: So I have a little bit of news here, but I guess I'll let Scott go first, because my news is actually really little, so I got a bunch of them.

39
00:01:34,151 --> 00:01:41,250
Scott: So my news is actually something I don't personally really care about, but I know that every nerd in the universe does care about it, right?

40
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:49,805
Scott: So many nerdy people who are very popular amongst the nerds, but are not popular amongst me, such as Wil Wheaton.

41
00:01:53,192 --> 00:01:54,609
Rym: I believe you mean Wil Wheaton.

42
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,433
Scott: Sure, whatever.

43
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,750
Scott: And who's that other girl?

44
00:02:00,816 --> 00:02:01,788
Rym: I think the point is made.

45
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,149
Scott: Felicia Day.

46
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:05,048
Rym: I think.

47
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,810
Scott: The people that I know, they're nerdy famous people, right?

48
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,669
Rym: At least you recognize them as nerdy famous people.

49
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,298
Scott: Well, I mean, when you're in the middle of nerd town, right?

50
00:02:13,418 --> 00:02:16,950
Scott: It's like, you know the nerdy things you don't like, you know that they exist, right?

51
00:02:17,111 --> 00:02:20,270
Rym: As an exercise to our listeners, I'm going to ask Scott one question, one question only.

52
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:29,610
Rym: Name any actor from Friends, Mad About You, Cheers, or Seinfeld other than Jerry Seinfeld.

53
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,059
Scott: Oh, I can do Seinfeld, right?

54
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:35,426
Scott: Kramer's name is Mike Richards or something?

55
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,067
Scott: Is that correct?

56
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,225
Scott: Costanza is Alexander something?

57
00:02:41,325 --> 00:02:42,310
Scott: No, Jason Alexander.

58
00:02:43,815 --> 00:02:44,490
Scott: And Elaine is...

59
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:45,830
Rym: So outside of Seinfeld.

60
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,495
Scott: Outside of Seinfeld?

61
00:02:47,515 --> 00:02:49,210
Scott: I don't know any one of those other shows at all.

62
00:02:49,955 --> 00:02:51,223
Rym: So Felicia Day should feel honored.

63
00:02:51,243 --> 00:02:51,967
Rym: Anyway.

64
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:59,250
Scott: So anyway, so they're basically making a show that's sort of like celebrity poker, right?

65
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:05,630
Scott: Where they basically, they get together at a table and play poker and you know, you're entertained because they chat while playing, right?

66
00:03:06,512 --> 00:03:10,750
Scott: But instead of playing poker, the show is called Tabletop and they're going to play tabletop games.

67
00:03:11,251 --> 00:03:18,350
Scott: We're not exactly sure what games they're going to play, if it's going to be RPGs or board games or if they're going to play hardcore games or less core, I don't know.

68
00:03:20,011 --> 00:03:23,010
Scott: I'm pretty sure they're going to play real board games because they're going to be switching up the people.

69
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,460
Scott: So I don't think RPGs are really going to be how it's done.

70
00:03:25,922 --> 00:03:27,128
Scott: Maybe one shot RPGs?

71
00:03:27,168 --> 00:03:27,670
Scott: I have no idea.

72
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,543
Scott: But that's what they're going to do, which is a pretty interesting idea.

73
00:03:30,563 --> 00:03:31,609
Scott: I wish I had thought of it.

74
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,248
Scott: And yeah, I'm sure nerds all over the place will be like, "Oh my God, this is the

75
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:37,550
Scott: best.".

76
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:41,670
Scott: And they'll watch every episode and be crazy obsessed with it and I won't give a shit, but that's okay.

77
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,056
Rym: We'll see.

78
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:42,629
Rym: Could be good.

79
00:03:44,151 --> 00:03:46,850
Scott: Yeah, but even if it's good, I don't really care about any of these people, right?

80
00:03:46,951 --> 00:03:48,278
Rym: Yeah, but you don't have to care about the people.

81
00:03:48,298 --> 00:03:50,610
Rym: I mean, you started caring about the people in Running Man.

82
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,710
Rym: You didn't know who they were ahead of time, except for the girls.

83
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,168
Scott: But the thing is, I've seen these people before and I'm not a fan, right?

84
00:03:58,858 --> 00:04:00,410
Scott: It's not like these are new people I haven't seen.

85
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,510
Rym: Ah, but you mostly have seen them in their element, which is an element you don't like.

86
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:07,410
Rym: What if they're in some other element that you like?

87
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:09,183
Scott: Maybe I'll watch an episode.

88
00:04:09,203 --> 00:04:10,010
Scott: We'll see how it goes.

89
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:10,961
Rym: Maybe we'll do a show.

90
00:04:11,022 --> 00:04:11,570
Scott: We'll review it.

91
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,270
Scott: We're not going to knock it if we haven't watched it, right?

92
00:04:13,732 --> 00:04:16,769
Rym: If we review it, then the nerds will come out of the woodwork and put the hate on.

93
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:23,430
Rym: I mean, the hate I got, even for asking what Homestuck was about, I still don't know what Homestuck is about.

94
00:04:23,912 --> 00:04:25,710
Scott: I researched it even more and still don't know.

95
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,730
Rym: Oh my god, yesterday we were trying to figure it out again, so we were reading the official wiki.

96
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,183
Rym: I guess the unofficial wiki?

97
00:04:31,203 --> 00:04:31,548
Rym: I don't know.

98
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:34,310
Scott: Any webcomic that needs a wiki, there's a problem.

99
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:39,690
Rym: But the thing is, the more I read the wiki, the less I understood.

100
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:40,890
Scott: Yep, absolutely.

101
00:04:41,332 --> 00:04:43,263
Rym: And someone explained what it was.

102
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,027
Rym: I was like, "Oh, that makes

103
00:04:44,047 --> 00:04:44,269
Rym: sense.".

104
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:48,510
Rym: But then I read the wiki, and that didn't in any way relate to what that other guy said.

105
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,559
Scott: That's how it goes.

106
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:50,630
Scott: That's what I've noticed.

107
00:04:50,851 --> 00:04:53,250
Scott: I think it's a big elaborate hoax or something.

108
00:04:54,513 --> 00:04:55,220
Rym: Except I read it.

109
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:55,785
Rym: It's real.

110
00:04:55,846 --> 00:04:56,310
Rym: It's there.

111
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,728
Scott: Who knows?

112
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:11,901
Rym: So, many of you may know, I've talked about this in the past, but not recently, but the Game Boy was pretty much the biggest, most popular... It was THE handheld console.

113
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:13,430
Rym: It was the first viable handheld console.

114
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,230
Scott: Oh yeah, and if you combine all the Game Boys together, right?

115
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,610
Scott: Advanced, color, you know, everything.

116
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:23,130
Scott: And even without including DS's, it's pretty much the number one console, period.

117
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,290
Scott: If you include the DS's, forget about it.

118
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:30,124
Rym: This is why it was such amazing news that the PSP was even a fraction of the market.

119
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:36,750
Scott: Everyone has tried Game Gear's Neo Geo Pocket colors and all sorts of...

120
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:36,994
Rym: The Lynx?

121
00:05:37,035 --> 00:05:37,568
Rym: Remember the Lynx?

122
00:05:37,711 --> 00:05:38,250
Scott: Yeah, Lynx.

123
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,709
Rym: I wanted a Lynx so bad.

124
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,515
Scott: What's it called?

125
00:05:41,596 --> 00:05:42,845
Scott: Wonderswan, right?

126
00:05:42,946 --> 00:05:43,530
Scott: All sorts of things.

127
00:05:43,831 --> 00:05:44,470
Rym: That wasn't really in the US.

128
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,253
Scott: It doesn't matter.

129
00:05:45,514 --> 00:05:48,110
Scott: All these things were tried and failed.

130
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:52,529
Scott: Back to the PSP, it didn't succeed stunningly.

131
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:53,369
Rym: But it didn't die.

132
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,494
Scott: It didn't die.

133
00:05:54,514 --> 00:05:57,710
Scott: And now there's even a new PSP, like the PSP Vita, right?

134
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,648
Scott: Or something like that, yeah.

135
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,130
Rym: So, back in the day, you know, we actually... I got a Game Gear.

136
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,890
Rym: Saved up money, allowances forever for that thing.

137
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,048
Scott: I just played other people's Game Gear's.

138
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:10,350
Rym: Yeah, so I actually had a Game Gear and we also had a Game Boy.

139
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,030
Rym: And my brother mostly played the Game Boy and I mostly played the Game Gear.

140
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,750
Rym: And to this day, I'm actually kind of amazed.

141
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:20,110
Rym: The Game Gear, for its time, looked amazing graphics-wise.

142
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,847
Rym: Granted, the battery lasted like 10 minutes, but...

143
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:29,790
Scott: Yeah, if you play a Game Gear today and you're not emulating the game, it's pretty awful because the screen has the worst ghosting in the universe.

144
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,830
Rym: But the games got around that.

145
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,370
Rym: The games were designed where that wouldn't be a problem.

146
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:40,090
Scott: Yeah, but... The thing is, there were some Game Boy games that today I would go back and play.

147
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,831
Scott: Like, Kirby's Dream Land 1.

148
00:06:41,831 --> 00:06:44,407
Rym: Ah, there are Game Gear games I would go back and play.

149
00:06:44,428 --> 00:06:44,669
Scott: Not many.

150
00:06:45,073 --> 00:06:45,947
Scott: I can't even think of one.

151
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,330
Rym: The Sonic on the Game Gear was different from every other Sonic.

152
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,849
Scott: It was different, but it wasn't... It was good.

153
00:06:51,652 --> 00:06:55,926
Scott: It was good for a Game Gear game, but it wasn't good.

154
00:06:55,966 --> 00:06:57,270
Scott: I'm gonna go back and play it, right?

155
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,283
Rym: So, how about Dragon Crystal?

156
00:06:59,303 --> 00:07:00,310
Rym: Do you know what Dragon Crystal is?

157
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,608
Scott: You and your Dragon Crystal and your Gemfire... What is Dragon Crystal?

158
00:07:02,891 --> 00:07:03,695
Rym: And Scott, no.

159
00:07:03,895 --> 00:07:07,010
Rym: Me and my Dragon Crystal, you're thinking of Crystal Warriors.

160
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,600
Scott: No, I'm thinking of... This is your Gemfire bullshit.

161
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,130
Scott: A little turn-based wizard moving.

162
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:11,512
Scott: No.

163
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:11,824
Scott: Not at all.

164
00:07:12,296 --> 00:07:12,527
Scott: No?

165
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:12,754
Scott: No.

166
00:07:13,554 --> 00:07:13,930
Scott: Okay.

167
00:07:14,831 --> 00:07:19,810
Rym: Like I said, the one you're thinking of is Crystal Warriors, which is basically proto-Advance Wars.

168
00:07:21,091 --> 00:07:22,630
Rym: Dragon Crystal is NetHack.

169
00:07:23,952 --> 00:07:25,630
Rym: And Dragon Crystal was on the Game Gear.

170
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:32,370
Rym: And the reason I bring this up is because... You know what's coming now to the Nintendo 3DS download library?

171
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:33,129
Rym: Dragon Crystal?

172
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,009
Rym: The Game Gear library.

173
00:07:35,814 --> 00:07:36,109
Scott: Great.

174
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,170
Rym: The Game Gear was important for one big reason.

175
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:38,921
Scott: But you're not gonna buy a 3DS.

176
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:40,081
Rym: Oh, no.

177
00:07:40,102 --> 00:07:40,350
Rym: Fuck that.

178
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:44,670
Scott: Nor are you gonna pay to download a game for it that you could just play in a Game Gear emulator for free.

179
00:07:44,851 --> 00:07:45,750
Scott: I own a Game Gear.

180
00:07:45,971 --> 00:07:48,470
Scott: You could probably play them on a DS Lite with a cart.

181
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,949
Rym: I own a Game Gear.

182
00:07:50,794 --> 00:07:51,248
Rym: Where is it?

183
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,813
Rym: It still works.

184
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,190
Rym: I also own every good game on the Game Gear.

185
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:54,869
Scott: Yeah, where is it?

186
00:07:55,152 --> 00:07:56,210
Rym: I don't know, in a box somewhere?

187
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,070
Scott: Yeah, so it's not in your possession.

188
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,519
Rym: There's a mod you can do where.

189
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:03,288
Rym: if you put two different kinds of batteries... I don't want to talk about the Game Gear, but anyway...

190
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,550
Scott: Because one side runs down fast on the other side.

191
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:09,510
Rym: Yeah, so like two of the batteries were for the screen and the other four were for the Game Gear.

192
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:09,869
Scott: Exactly.

193
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,830
Rym: And yet the screen needed so much power that it would drain those two batteries like that.

194
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,110
Scott: Yep, and then you rotate the batteries and then you're...

195
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:22,449
Rym: I had this like pound and a half gigantic... Like it looked like one of those satellite phones from an 80s movie.

196
00:08:23,012 --> 00:08:24,805
Rym: And it was a battery pack for the Game Gear.

197
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:25,839
Scott: Yep.

198
00:08:26,951 --> 00:08:30,685
Rym: Seriously, the Game Gear, you know, when it came out... You look at it now, you're like,

199
00:08:30,726 --> 00:08:30,930
Rym: "Whatever.".

200
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,730
Rym: Look at when it came out and look at the Game Boy and just look at that screen.

201
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,129
Rym: That was some amazing shit.

202
00:08:37,352 --> 00:08:37,544
Scott: Whatever.

203
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:38,470
Rym: Yeah, whatever.

204
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:44,670
Rym: But the fact that these games are coming back... And it's funny, the article mentioned Shinobi, Sonic, and Dragon Crystal.

205
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:48,890
Rym: I can only name like four other Game Gear games that were actually really good.

206
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:51,450
Scott: Name another Game Gear game that was...

207
00:08:51,511 --> 00:08:52,226
Rym: Crystal Warriors.

208
00:08:53,435 --> 00:08:54,289
Scott: I can't name one.

209
00:08:54,532 --> 00:08:58,042
Rym: There was also a pretty good RPG that was set in the... Like it was an Arabian theme.

210
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:58,790
Rym: I forget what it was called.

211
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,370
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna go look up Top Game Gear Games.

212
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:06,186
Rym: Haley Wars was an okay shmup in the like... Kinda like... Here we go.

213
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:10,450
Scott: Top 10 Game Gear games according to vgcharts.com.

214
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,849
Scott: Shining Force, that's an RPG.

215
00:09:13,774 --> 00:09:14,650
Scott: Sonic 2, of course.

216
00:09:14,795 --> 00:09:14,905
Scott: Yep.

217
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:15,930
Scott: We mentioned that already.

218
00:09:16,952 --> 00:09:17,869
Scott: Shining Force again.

219
00:09:19,813 --> 00:09:21,110
Scott: And Shinobi 2.

220
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,220
Rym: Yep.

221
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:22,990
Scott: And Lion King.

222
00:09:24,135 --> 00:09:25,790
Scott: Oh, there was an Aladdin for the Game Gear, I think.

223
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,170
Scott: You know, it was that side-scrolling Aladdin.

224
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:27,869
Rym: Yeah, it was a lot.

225
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:28,630
Scott: Shinobi 1.

226
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,090
Rym: I didn't own the Aladdin, but it was a lot like the one on the Genesis.

227
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,689
Scott: Power Rangers game.

228
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,730
Scott: Sonic Triple Trouble.

229
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:36,550
Scott: I never played that one.

230
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:36,969
Scott: I didn't play that.

231
00:09:37,471 --> 00:09:38,641
Scott: Oh, it looks like Sonic Chaos.

232
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,990
Scott: I never played that one either.

233
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,028
Scott: And Columns.

234
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,130
Scott: Alright, Columns was like the Tetris equivalent.

235
00:09:46,015 --> 00:09:46,750
Rym: I hated Columns.

236
00:09:46,851 --> 00:09:47,929
Scott: No, Columns is not good.

237
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:48,910
Scott: Battle Balls is better.

238
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:49,143
Scott: Anyway.

239
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:49,500
Rym: Yep.

240
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:52,068
Rym: So I got one more little news, just because.

241
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:59,609
Rym: So Nintendo, you might have noticed that in the Icarus game, they've changed their nomenclature for- The new 3DS one?

242
00:09:59,852 --> 00:09:59,941
Rym: Yeah.

243
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,229
Rym: For local multiplayer.

244
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,910
Rym: So instead of calling it multiplayer, they call it together.

245
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:04,927
Rym: Mm-hmm.

246
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,049
Rym: So solo or together are the modes.

247
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:15,928
Rym: And the interesting thing is, instead of saying, like, Wi-Fi or network or, you know, they've all had all these different terms, now they call it far away or nearby.

248
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:17,429
Scott: No, that's not bad.

249
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:17,748
Rym: I know.

250
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,150
Rym: Now, nerds are flipping their shit and complaining.

251
00:10:20,516 --> 00:10:20,830
Rym: Who cares?

252
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:25,429
Rym: These nerds, seriously, nobody knows what ad hoc networking is but you.

253
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,550
Scott: What the fuck, does it matter what word they use?

254
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:27,863
Scott: Yeah.

255
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,850
Scott: Do they have the feature?

256
00:10:29,131 --> 00:10:29,569
Scott: Does it work?

257
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,730
Scott: Now, of course it doesn't work.

258
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:38,449
Rym: Nintendo, I don't trust to do multiplayer on anything but a console connected to my PC for the life of me.

259
00:10:38,592 --> 00:10:39,169
Scott: Yeah, right?

260
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:46,630
Rym: But that aside, the kind of meta controversy about this among nerds is bullshit.

261
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:51,230
Rym: Gaming has to be accessible, and I see no reason- I don't care what word they use.

262
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,650
Scott: They could use, they could call it like, you know, mode A and mode B like in Gyromite.

263
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,063
Scott: We had no idea which mode went.

264
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:57,710
Scott: what, right?

265
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,469
Scott: It doesn't matter to me what they call it.

266
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,190
Scott: All that matters is, do they have the multiplayer?

267
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:02,569
Scott: Does it work?

268
00:11:02,951 --> 00:11:03,749
Scott: And the question, does it work?

269
00:11:04,293 --> 00:11:04,630
Rym: We don't know.

270
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,449
Rym: The game didn't come out yet.

271
00:11:05,675 --> 00:11:06,030
Scott: Oh, okay.

272
00:11:06,472 --> 00:11:08,010
Rym: It comes out in three days, in fact.

273
00:11:08,356 --> 00:11:08,670
Scott: All right.

274
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,810
Rym: But I got these pictures here and it'll be interesting to see.

275
00:11:12,397 --> 00:11:12,930
Rym: I don't know.

276
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,910
Rym: I haven't kept up on how much they're still using friend codes.

277
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,570
Rym: I think they've changed a lot of that, but I don't know.

278
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,230
Rym: It's weird.

279
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,089
Rym: Look at GeekNights five years ago.

280
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:21,848
Rym: What would we say?

281
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,269
Rym: Nintendo is winning.

282
00:11:23,793 --> 00:11:24,309
Rym: DS is best.

283
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:30,004
Scott: Well, the earliest Nintendo, the earliest GeekNights from like '05, '06 were like, "Oh my god, PC gaming is to

284
00:11:30,045 --> 00:11:30,429
Scott: dead.".

285
00:11:30,611 --> 00:11:32,629
Rym: Now, you might say we were wrong.

286
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:33,750
Rym: That's not true.

287
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,350
Rym: Back then, PC gaming was fucking dead.

288
00:11:35,592 --> 00:11:35,888
Scott: It was.

289
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:37,629
Scott: Steam was only two years old.

290
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,250
Scott: It was at the point where I- There wasn't any Minecraft.

291
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:45,799
Rym: I bought a Mac Mini as my primary PC because I decided, "Eh, I don't need to play games online

292
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,147
Rym: anymore.".

293
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:46,376
Rym: Yeah.

294
00:11:47,155 --> 00:11:48,729
Rym: And PC gaming's coming back?

295
00:11:49,496 --> 00:11:50,269
Scott: Well, it's already back.

296
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,287
Rym: Yeah, it's still coming though because NS2 is not there yet.

297
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:58,610
Scott: But there's three possible FPSs that can bring back the silver age of FPS.

298
00:11:58,890 --> 00:11:59,790
Scott: That's Counter-Strike GO.

299
00:11:59,972 --> 00:12:00,468
Rym: Oh my god.

300
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,407
Scott: Tactical- Insertion.

301
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:03,310
Scott: Infiltration.

302
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:04,547
Scott: Whatever it is.

303
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,469
Rym: Wasn't it Insertion?

304
00:12:05,795 --> 00:12:06,087
Scott: I don't know.

305
00:12:06,632 --> 00:12:07,070
Scott: I haven't.

306
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:07,589
Scott: I don't even know.

307
00:12:08,191 --> 00:12:08,454
Scott: And TI.

308
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:11,406
Scott: And NS2.

309
00:12:12,152 --> 00:12:12,789
Scott: One of those three.

310
00:12:12,951 --> 00:12:18,289
Scott: And, you know, Tribes, whatever, Tribes Ascend would have been on the list if it wasn't all micro bullshit.

311
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:18,859
Scott: Yeah.

312
00:12:20,152 --> 00:12:31,900
Rym: I really just want to play Tribes to... But anyway, things of the day.

313
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,759
Rym: So, friends Pete and Neri were over and they brought me a book that I'd seen people talking about and mashing up on the internet.

314
00:12:37,962 --> 00:12:39,039
Scott: I hadn't seen it before ever.

315
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,416
Rym: But I hadn't paid attention to it.

316
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:46,452
Rym: So, we read the book aloud and doing the teacher thing where you turn and show that it's a page.

317
00:12:47,148 --> 00:12:47,940
Scott: It's a children's book.

318
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:58,119
Rym: Called I Want My Hat Back by John Classen and this is on the level of the greatest children's books ever written.

319
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,800
Scott: It's like, you know, you think of the greatest children's books.

320
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,479
Rym: It's like the monster at the end of the book.

321
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,704
Scott: Or like you got the Dr.

322
00:13:03,744 --> 00:13:12,240
Scott: Seusses, you got, you know, Hungry Hungry Caterpillar, you got Goodnight Moon, you got, right, let me think of another one.

323
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,760
Scott: Like, Midnight, what's the train?

324
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,959
Scott: The snow train, the Christmas train.

325
00:13:15,244 --> 00:13:15,535
Rym: Oh yeah.

326
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,360
Rym: What's it called?

327
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,060
Scott: I forget, something express.

328
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,419
Scott: Polar Express.

329
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,339
Rym: But there's a good list of kids books.

330
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,920
Scott: Yeah, there's, you know, there's Richard Scarry, right, Busytown.

331
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,300
Rym: And then there's the kind of modern kids books like Go to Fuck to Sleep that's like almost there.

332
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:27,660
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

333
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:30,540
Scott: But the point is, those books, it's like those are so old, those books.

334
00:13:30,761 --> 00:13:33,260
Scott: But they are so timeless and perfect forever.

335
00:13:34,561 --> 00:13:36,820
Scott: What's the one that Christopher Walken read?

336
00:13:37,102 --> 00:13:38,300
Scott: Where the Wild Things Are, right?

337
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:45,240
Scott: These books are so timeless and perfect, you can't imagine that there would be another entry into that category.

338
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:48,900
Rym: You think every story like that has been told.

339
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,280
Scott: Right, it's like our whole lives, there hasn't been a new one of those.

340
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,320
Scott: All the ones that I read in elementary school are still the ones.

341
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,980
Scott: There aren't any newer ones that are in that quality level.

342
00:14:00,681 --> 00:14:01,759
Scott: Like, you just sort of accept it.

343
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:06,020
Scott: Oh, I guess it's not possible to write the new classic children's book.

344
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:11,438
Rym: But then, out of nowhere, John Classen writes one of the greatest children's books of all time.

345
00:14:11,682 --> 00:14:13,939
Scott: It is on the same level as all those greats.

346
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:19,400
Rym: The reason it is good is, one, you have to read it, the bear's voice, "My hat is gone.

347
00:14:20,183 --> 00:14:21,339
Rym: I want it back.

348
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:23,217
Rym: Have you seen my

349
00:14:23,318 --> 00:14:23,480
Rym: hat?".

350
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:24,627
Scott: No.

351
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:34,820
Rym: And it's got the classic, the page where you figure out who stole the hat, the kids you're reading it to will be like, "Oh, my God, that's the fucking head.

352
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,780
Rym: Why doesn't the bear fucking do something?

353
00:14:37,063 --> 00:14:37,145
Rym: Ah!".

354
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,560
Rym: And then it just got requested.

355
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,740
Scott: I don't think the kids will say fucking unless they're awesome.

356
00:14:41,904 --> 00:14:43,040
Rym: Well, society's changing.

357
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,983
Rym: You know, when you translate a kid's thoughts, the kid is not thinking, "Oh, the fucking blah,".

358
00:14:48,204 --> 00:14:50,300
Rym: but that's what it translates into.

359
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,838
Scott: Yeah, the whole class is like, "This is it.

360
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,372
Rym: This is it.

361
00:14:52,622 --> 00:14:52,897
Rym: I see it.

362
00:14:53,245 --> 00:14:53,878
Rym: The rabbit has it.

363
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,122
Rym: Oh, my

364
00:14:54,204 --> 00:14:54,347
Rym: God.".

365
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,455
Rym: Spoilers.

366
00:14:56,801 --> 00:14:57,600
Scott: I'm not going to spoil it.

367
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,357
Scott: The rabbit has the hat.

368
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:05,719
Rym: There is a page that when I turn to it, I could do nothing but hear the Kill Bill music in my head.

369
00:15:06,603 --> 00:15:09,520
Rym: This is one of the greatest illustrations in any book ever.

370
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:16,339
Rym: This book is great, and you have to read it.

371
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,199
Scott: This is the best book.

372
00:15:17,962 --> 00:15:19,299
Scott: You know, I don't even want to say it's a kid's book.

373
00:15:19,481 --> 00:15:20,240
Scott: All-ages book.

374
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,520
Rym: Someone already mashed it up with Madoka Magica on YouTube.

375
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,158
Scott: It's crazy.

376
00:15:25,103 --> 00:15:27,000
Scott: I want to see a lot more mashups of this style.

377
00:15:27,382 --> 00:15:27,640
Rym: Guys, ponies.

378
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,840
Rym: It's so easy.

379
00:15:29,102 --> 00:15:29,318
Scott: I know.

380
00:15:29,861 --> 00:15:36,300
Scott: I was surprised there wasn't already a pony who stole my hat going on, especially since you could use Applejack's hat so easily.

381
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:36,819
Rym: Oh, my God.

382
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,039
Scott: And you could have Angel Bunny steal it, right?

383
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,820
Rym: Because Angel is a jerk, as we just learned.

384
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:43,000
Scott: And it's a bunny in both situations.

385
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,098
Rym: The rabbit kind of deserved it.

386
00:15:46,087 --> 00:15:46,278
Scott: Yeah.

387
00:15:47,182 --> 00:15:48,400
Rym: Anyway, that's my thing of the day.

388
00:15:48,724 --> 00:15:49,140
Rym: That's okay.

389
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,079
Scott: So, my thing of the day.

390
00:15:50,481 --> 00:15:52,119
Scott: So, I don't forget it like I did in a previous show.

391
00:15:52,720 --> 00:16:02,980
Scott: I got two recipes here because it's sunny out and it's warm, which means you can grill, and it means you can walk to the grocery store without putting on a coat, so you're more likely to get some groceries and ingredients.

392
00:16:03,022 --> 00:16:03,399
Rym: Oh, my God.

393
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,220
Rym: I smelled on the way home yesterday from work every grill in the world.

394
00:16:07,646 --> 00:16:08,180
Scott: I know, right?

395
00:16:08,324 --> 00:16:08,840
Rym: Oh, my God.

396
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,297
Rym: I want to eat.

397
00:16:09,561 --> 00:16:10,700
Scott: It's RIT frisbee day anyway.

398
00:16:11,382 --> 00:16:13,520
Scott: So, I found these two awesome recipes, right?

399
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,860
Scott: So, one of them is onion rings sunny side up eggs.

400
00:16:16,961 --> 00:16:18,179
Scott: The way you do this is real simple.

401
00:16:18,821 --> 00:16:22,300
Scott: You take the onion and you go chop, chop, chop so that you get rings.

402
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,040
Scott: Onion, you know, just onion rings.

403
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:25,060
Rym: Not onion rings.

404
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,900
Scott: Not onion rings like you order at the diner.

405
00:16:27,062 --> 00:16:28,438
Scott: Just, you know, they're rings of onion.

406
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,558
Rym: Not chicken rings.

407
00:16:29,943 --> 00:16:30,280
Scott: Exactly.

408
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,959
Scott: They're not fried yet or anything like that.

409
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,096
Scott: You put the rings on the hot, you know, pan.

410
00:16:36,483 --> 00:16:40,200
Scott: Then you put the egg inside the ring and you can cook the egg any style you want.

411
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,560
Scott: Cook it inside the ring.

412
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,740
Scott: It's the same way as Girl Scouts.

413
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,920
Scott: They cut out the middle of the bread and they put the egg in the middle.

414
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:45,659
Scott: So, what I want to do.

415
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,340
Scott: Instead of using bread, use the onion.

416
00:16:47,821 --> 00:16:48,880
Rym: I'm going to cut a hole in the bread.

417
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:49,520
Rym: Or use a pepper.

418
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,840
Rym: Put the onion hole in the bread.

419
00:16:52,242 --> 00:16:52,758
Rym: You could do that.

420
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:58,120
Scott: Or you could cut open a pepper and get sort of like that flower shape of, you know, because the pepper's hollow, right?

421
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,365
Scott: So, cut like a pepper slice.

422
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:03,077
Scott: that's, you know, a complete circle with, you know, bumps on the sides.

423
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:08,560
Scott: Put the egg in that mother and it'll actually be thinner because the pepper's probably a little bit bigger and it might be cooked faster.

424
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,359
Scott: And you know, you do whatever style you want.

425
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:16,299
Scott: If you want to do sunny side up, you know, try to keep the yolk together and then cover it with a lid and put some steam in there so it gets nice and cooked.

426
00:17:16,781 --> 00:17:20,489
Scott: Or maybe, you know, scramble them up and then pour them in there and then do a flip of the onion.

427
00:17:21,121 --> 00:17:22,980
Scott: You know, you can try to mix it up and do whatever you want.

428
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:23,738
Rym: It's a good idea.

429
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:24,369
Scott: Yup.

430
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,659
Scott: Alright, so second recipe.

431
00:17:26,162 --> 00:17:27,579
Scott: This one's definitely for the grilling.

432
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,218
Scott: Take a banana.

433
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,058
Scott: Don't peel the banana.

434
00:17:30,281 --> 00:17:34,500
Scott: Take a knife and stab the banana and cut a line all the way down with the peel on.

435
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,698
Scott: Not, you know, like with the banana split, you're going to open the banana and cut it in half.

436
00:17:38,101 --> 00:17:41,180
Scott: Do not actually, you know, remove the peel.

437
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,731
Scott: Just put a slit in the banana.

438
00:17:42,751 --> 00:17:43,760
Scott: so now it's sort of like a vagina.

439
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:44,380
Rym: Peel it?

440
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,298
Scott: Then sort of squeeze it open.

441
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,819
Scott: And then stuff it full of good stuff.

442
00:17:53,884 --> 00:17:54,519
Rym: I'll let that go.

443
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,299
Scott: This is a show.

444
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,460
Scott: We have to entertain the peoples.

445
00:17:57,061 --> 00:17:57,820
Scott: So, right?

446
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,100
Scott: And stuff it full of good stuff.

447
00:17:59,464 --> 00:18:00,980
Scott: By good stuff, I mean anything.

448
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:08,340
Scott: Like chocolate chips or, you know, whipped cream probably wouldn't be good to put in first.

449
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,320
Scott: You put the whipped cream on afterwards, right?

450
00:18:10,502 --> 00:18:11,459
Rym: I guess that's at the end.

451
00:18:11,861 --> 00:18:12,199
Scott: Yeah, right?

452
00:18:13,621 --> 00:18:16,860
Scott: But, you know, you might want to put some like butterscotch in there or chocolate syrup.

453
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,100
Rym: How are you going to clean it though?

454
00:18:19,043 --> 00:18:19,798
Scott: Don't worry about that.

455
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,600
Rym: Or do you just eat the entire thing?

456
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,380
Scott: If you're a heathen, you can put some coconut in there or something like that.

457
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,420
Scott: Any sort of topping that can handle cooking.

458
00:18:27,287 --> 00:18:28,860
Scott: Then you wrap that mother in tinfoil.

459
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:29,936
Scott: Peel and all.

460
00:18:30,461 --> 00:18:31,160
Scott: Pack it in tight.

461
00:18:32,282 --> 00:18:33,860
Scott: And then put that mother on the grill.

462
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:37,220
Rym: What's with you and saying "that mother" on this show?

463
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,100
Scott: That mother because it's a mother.

464
00:18:38,621 --> 00:18:39,999
Scott: You put it on the grill, right?

465
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:43,160
Rym: Actually it's not because Cavendish bananas are nothing but clones.

466
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:43,500
Scott: I know.

467
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:50,196
Scott: You wait for it to melt and all the goodies inside to sort of melt into the banana and for the banana meat itself to sort of get mushy.

468
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:56,400
Scott: Then you take that off the grill, open up the tinfoils, and then you would apply whipped cream or other non-cookable toppings.

469
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:57,379
Rym: Scott, I'm so hungry.

470
00:18:57,981 --> 00:19:00,559
Scott: And then you take the peel off and go om nom nom nom nom.

471
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,620
Rym: So what, pray tell, is this mystical dish called?

472
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,539
Scott: It's called a banana boat.

473
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:09,580
Rym: You may recall the last time we talked about a banana recipe was in fact monkey business.

474
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:18,720
Rym: The summary of that one is basically take French toast but make the French toast out of banana bread.

475
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:19,639
Scott: Yeah, it works.

476
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,673
Scott: The problem is...

477
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:21,620
Rym: It's too much.

478
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,437
Scott: You have to cut it.

479
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,013
Scott: The secret is cut it thinner, right?

480
00:19:25,141 --> 00:19:26,380
Scott: This is why we failed on monkey bread.

481
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,860
Scott: We used too much egg and we had too thick banana bread.

482
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:35,480
Scott: Cut the banana bread thinner, use less egg, and make sure the egg is nicely watered and orange juiced so that it's, you know, more dilute.

483
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:35,997
Scott: Then it works.

484
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:36,330
Scott: Yep.

485
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:41,340
Rym: So in the meta moment, of course we're going to be at the Penny Arcade Expo East.

486
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:50,620
Rym: And we are either in, involved with, or have very close friends and associates who are doing many events on Friday.

487
00:19:50,865 --> 00:19:51,639
Rym: What is Burning Wheel?

488
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,239
Rym: Luke Crane.

489
00:19:52,861 --> 00:19:54,560
Rym: The GeekNights Board Game Workshop.

490
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:55,219
Rym: That's us.

491
00:19:55,219 --> 00:19:55,834
Rym: 6 to 8 p.m.

492
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:56,839
Scott: That's going to be the best.

493
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,300
Rym: In the Tabletop Workshop Theater.

494
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:04,860
Rym: We are teaching the audience in the Tabletop Workshop, which is basically a classroom with tables and everything.

495
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,920
Scott: Yeah, it's like there's going to be all these panel rooms, right?

496
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,760
Scott: But it's like, okay, you know, panels are mostly good, sometimes not so good, right?

497
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,880
Scott: The Tabletop Workshop room is going to be the awesomest room.

498
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:19,660
Rym: Yeah, we tried this out and they did it at PAX Prime and it was a huge success.

499
00:20:19,923 --> 00:20:21,180
Scott: It was a tiny room.

500
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:22,120
Rym: Yeah, they tested it.

501
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:22,877
Rym: It worked really well.

502
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,180
Scott: But it just didn't get enough attention on it.

503
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,453
Rym: It has many more rooms, so they made a real panel room.

504
00:20:28,473 --> 00:20:30,538
Rym: that's just for these kinds of workshops.

505
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:39,480
Rym: So we're in there for two hours teaching everyone how to play and win Carcassonne and Agricola and a secret game and we'll do some other fun things.

506
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:50,680
Scott: Yeah, but we're basically going to teach you how to play, if you've never played it before, and even if you have played it before, we'll teach you how to win or at least the best strategies that we know so that you'll start off playing.

507
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,420
Scott: You won't just have to derp your way through a whole bunch of games.

508
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,100
Scott: You'll only have to derp your way through one or two games.

509
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,040
Rym: Then that evening, Lauren Green, her documentary, Going Cardboard, will be screening.

510
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,259
Scott: If you don't already have the DVD.

511
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:08,700
Rym: And we should, at least one of us, or both of us, will be around because she's going to do a Q&A afterward and there's going to be some fun stuff.

512
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:16,400
Rym: She'll also be in the Kickstarter room doing another screening and I imagine if you want to talk to her about the documentary, she'll be really accessible.

513
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,580
Scott: That's pretty much all she'll be doing.

514
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:28,100
Rym: Saturday, Jared of Soren Crane, Parsley, Spooky Manor, Jungle Adventure, Action Castle fame will be doing Spooky Manor and Jungle Adventure.

515
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,759
Scott: Oh, I thought he was doing one on Friday also.

516
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:35,740
Rym: He's not doing one on Friday, but Saturday he's doing Spooky Manor and Jungle Adventure and on Sunday he's doing Z Ward.

517
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,380
Scott: Okay, I thought it was one each day, but I guess it's two Saturday, one Sunday.

518
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,280
Rym: And at 4.30 PM in the Cat Theater, we're doing Let's Play Money Making Game.

519
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:57,837
Rym: And that evening, and I want to go to this, at 6 o'clock in the Tabletop Workshop, Luke Crane is talking about how, he calls this panel the D&D.

520
00:21:57,878 --> 00:21:58,440
Rym: you never knew.

521
00:21:59,002 --> 00:22:00,579
Rym: And the premise of it is pretty cool.

522
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:08,699
Rym: He is going to talk about how we rail on Dungeons & Dragons for being a bad role-playing game, but it's bad because we try to use it to do things it's not good at.

523
00:22:09,281 --> 00:22:16,540
Rym: He talks about old-school, hardcore, dungeon-crawl D&D and how if you play that game as it's written, it's amazing.

524
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,100
Scott: Well, it is amazing, but it is also a dungeon-crawl.

525
00:22:19,683 --> 00:22:21,180
Scott: It's like Descent or HeroQuest.

526
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:28,860
Rym: Yeah, you can't fault D&D, like old-school D&D, for not being a burning wheel, of course not.

527
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,160
Rym: In the same way that I can't fault Doom for not having interspecies sex a la Mass Effect.

528
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,260
Scott: I mean, do you want to play D&D first, Ed?

529
00:22:36,643 --> 00:22:38,280
Scott: You know, I have the three color boxes.

530
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,760
Scott: The red, green, blue.

531
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,840
Scott: We can just play it, walk around dungeons, hit things with no expectation of role-playing.

532
00:22:44,042 --> 00:22:45,417
Rym: I think it'll be an interesting panel.

533
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,259
Rym: I want to see exactly what he has to say.

534
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:47,813
Scott: I do, too.

535
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:48,300
Scott: Yeah.

536
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:54,660
Rym: So PAX is going to be goddamn rockin', independent of Anime Boston on the same weekend?

537
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,080
Scott: You could say it's a mother.

538
00:22:59,043 --> 00:23:00,559
Rym: The Book Club book is The Hunger Games.

539
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,580
Rym: You know, the movie's coming.

540
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,740
Rym: Everyone's going apeshit about this book, so I figure we should review it.

541
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:21,259
Scott: From what I've heard, I haven't read it yet, so I'm not going to say, but what I've heard is basically, even people I follow and such who are not nerdy, were like, "Huh, everything seems to suggest that it's some sort of combination of Arnold Schwarzenegger running man and Battle

542
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:21,740
Scott: Royale.".

543
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,920
Rym: Oh, it is, but there's a third element.

544
00:23:24,142 --> 00:23:24,900
Scott: A third element, huh?

545
00:23:26,581 --> 00:23:26,858
Scott: Okay.

546
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,262
Scott: Like, straight up, 1984.

547
00:23:28,262 --> 00:23:30,860
Scott: Well, the Battle Royale has 1984, so that's not a new element.

548
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:38,360
Rym: It does, but the Battle Royale 1984 is a little far-fetched, the way it's presented, and a little superficial.

549
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:42,697
Scott: I think it just doesn't come across to the foreign audiences as well.

550
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,880
Rym: I know that Battle Royale focuses mostly on the kids fighting.

551
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,319
Scott: The movie, at least.

552
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:48,643
Scott: Yes.

553
00:23:49,108 --> 00:23:50,120
Rym: I haven't read the book, so I don't know.

554
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,703
Scott: The book is gigantic.

555
00:23:50,743 --> 00:23:53,620
Scott: I can't imagine that the book doesn't have more than the movie.

556
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:58,300
Rym: The Hunger Games starts quite a bit before and ends quite a bit after the actual fights.

557
00:24:00,323 --> 00:24:02,640
Rym: I liked it, but we'll save that for the review.

558
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,139
Rym: We'll find out.

559
00:24:03,682 --> 00:24:04,508
Rym: We've got internet stuff.

560
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,039
Rym: We've got a YouTube channel, Geeknight Stream.

561
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,427
Rym: We've got an awesome forum.

562
00:24:07,467 --> 00:24:08,272
Rym: We've got a Twitter.

563
00:24:08,292 --> 00:24:09,480
Rym: We've got a bunch of Twitters.

564
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,040
Scott: Facebook, Google Plus, whatever it is that you like.

565
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,080
Scott: I think you should connect with us in the way that you please.

566
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:20,480
Rym: And I will have a link to it, because as you know, we run the panels and workshops department of ConnectiCon.

567
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,265
Rym: Submissions are open.

568
00:24:22,647 --> 00:24:25,900
Rym: The forum still has a little bit of funkiness because it's on the new website.

569
00:24:27,286 --> 00:24:28,372
Rym: And we did not write the forum.

570
00:24:28,553 --> 00:24:29,680
Rym: Don't complain about the forum to me.

571
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,566
Scott: That has nothing to do with us.

572
00:24:30,607 --> 00:24:31,555
Scott: Complain to ConnectiCon.

573
00:24:31,575 --> 00:24:32,099
Scott: We didn't do it.

574
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,505
Rym: But the forum is up.

575
00:24:34,745 --> 00:24:36,228
Rym: You can submit your panels.

576
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:41,059
Rym: The people who approve panels are me and Scott.

577
00:24:42,901 --> 00:24:50,680
Scott: If there are weird fields on the forum that you don't know what to type in them, either type "nothing" or type "garble garble" and it won't even matter.

578
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,240
Rym: Unless that field is relevant to your thing.

579
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,146
Scott: Such as title or description.

580
00:24:55,688 --> 00:24:59,000
Scott: The point is, if you don't know what it is, then it's probably not for you.

581
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:07,280
Rym: But really, guys, you listeners, the people we know, you guys are the ones that are our go-to for good content at ConnectiCon.

582
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:14,040
Rym: Because historically, the people we know through GeekNights who submit panels do some of the best panels we got.

583
00:25:15,021 --> 00:25:23,600
Rym: So if you want to submit and you're a GeekNights listener, there's a good chance, unless your panel looks really shit, that we're going to put it in the schedule and get you a free badge or two.

584
00:25:25,408 --> 00:25:25,839
Rym: Anything else?

585
00:25:26,502 --> 00:25:27,159
Scott: No, let's do the show.

586
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:27,741
Scott: Alright.

587
00:25:28,242 --> 00:25:31,432
Rym: So Spotted was the sleeper hit of PAX.

588
00:25:31,492 --> 00:25:32,816
Rym: We were PAX East last year.

589
00:25:32,836 --> 00:25:33,960
Rym: We were jumping all over this game.

590
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,420
Scott: We can call this past year the year of Spotted.

591
00:25:36,662 --> 00:25:38,340
Rym: I own like three... Well, I have owned...

592
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,820
Scott: In fact, I think Spotted is probably the tabletop game of the year.

593
00:25:41,221 --> 00:25:44,840
Rym: I have owned like five Spotted sets because I keep buying it and giving it to people as gifts.

594
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:52,140
Rym: In fact, I gave the first Spotted set I bought that unfortunately has a "For Rectal Use Only" sticker on it to Robert Koo.

595
00:25:52,201 --> 00:25:53,120
Scott: Oh, you mean fortunately.

596
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:59,699
Rym: I'm curious to see if he has played that Spotted or if he has in fact not opened it for fear.

597
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,699
Scott: Well, if he has the Koo and A, you can go and ask him.

598
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,185
Rym: I will.

599
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:03,480
Rym: It's at midnight on Friday.

600
00:26:03,704 --> 00:26:03,894
Scott: I know.

601
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:08,934
Rym: So, Blue Orange Games made Spotted and they made another game.

602
00:26:08,954 --> 00:26:10,800
Rym: They have a lot of games that they've made.

603
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:15,760
Scott: I think they have an excess in their warehouse of circular cards and metal tins.

604
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,906
Rym: So Trigger is a newer game they made.

605
00:26:18,946 --> 00:26:20,330
Rym: that looks a lot like Spotted.

606
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:23,780
Rym: Little tin, circular cards, all that stuff.

607
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,659
Rym: And the way Trigger works... I'm going to spoil the review right now.

608
00:26:28,381 --> 00:26:31,720
Rym: It's a great concept and it was fun to play once.

609
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,008
Scott: Kind of.

610
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:33,459
Scott: Have fun.

611
00:26:33,882 --> 00:26:37,700
Rym: No, I would argue we had fun because of all the arguing and problems we had.

612
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,403
Scott: Sometimes it was fun.

613
00:26:38,504 --> 00:26:42,000
Scott: It's like part of the time we were playing was fun and part of the time we were playing was not fun.

614
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:48,917
Rym: You got to admit, when my question to all of you was, "The state we are in, ends in A,

615
00:26:48,937 --> 00:26:50,160
Rym: constant.".

616
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:51,240
Scott: That was the fun part.

617
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:59,579
Rym: So the way the game works is you have a card with a question on it or a statement like, "Your first name has an even number of

618
00:26:59,639 --> 00:26:59,920
Rym: letters."

619
00:27:00,141 --> 00:27:00,863
Rym: Or, "I have

620
00:27:00,924 --> 00:27:01,365
Rym: children."

621
00:27:02,108 --> 00:27:03,473
Rym: Or, "The answer is

622
00:27:03,594 --> 00:27:03,935
Rym: false.".

623
00:27:04,537 --> 00:27:05,180
Rym: Something like that.

624
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,500
Rym: You can whistle your own national anthem.

625
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:13,260
Rym: Everyone slams down either the right hand or the left hand on the trigger, which is the little foam pad.

626
00:27:14,181 --> 00:27:17,300
Rym: The right hand, you slam down if the statement is true.

627
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,280
Rym: Now if the statement says "you," then it means you personally.

628
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,548
Rym: So it's like, "You are wearing pink

629
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:24,050
Rym: shoes.".

630
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:26,620
Rym: Then if you are wearing pink shoes, you say true.

631
00:27:27,121 --> 00:27:33,060
Rym: But if the person says, "I am wearing pink shoes," it's as if the person who said the thing on the card is wearing pink shoes.

632
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,500
Scott: So if it's a "you" question, then people might have to give different answers.

633
00:27:38,222 --> 00:27:40,120
Scott: Let's say I'm wearing shoes and the guy next to me isn't.

634
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:41,465
Scott: It says, "You are wearing

635
00:27:41,506 --> 00:27:41,767
Scott: shoes.".

636
00:27:41,988 --> 00:27:44,660
Scott: Well, I'm going to put down the true hand and he's going to put down the false hand.

637
00:27:45,761 --> 00:27:55,440
Scott: But if it's a question where it's a "my" question, then it's a question about the question asker, in which case everyone has the same answer as is the correct answer.

638
00:27:57,005 --> 00:27:58,591
Rym: You put your left hand down for false.

639
00:27:59,353 --> 00:28:01,099
Rym: Then we sort it out.

640
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:05,860
Rym: Whoever put the correct answer down first gets to keep the card and they're the reader next.

641
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:11,880
Rym: Whoever put the first wrong answer down, if there is a wrong answer, gives up a card.

642
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,720
Rym: And then, based on the color of the back of the card, the person who won the point is now the new reader.

643
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,700
Rym: You go through until someone runs out of cards.

644
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,560
Scott: Right, so basically winning doesn't actually get you anything because you then have to read a new card.

645
00:28:25,882 --> 00:28:30,800
Scott: But it helps you because when you're reading a card, there's no chance you can lose one in that round.

646
00:28:31,301 --> 00:28:37,059
Scott: So if you win every round, there's basically no chance of you ever losing a card because you're reading questions the whole time.

647
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:44,060
Scott: But, so what the game comes down to is who can hold out the longest without losing all their cards.

648
00:28:44,701 --> 00:28:46,332
Scott: So the game could go on forever.

649
00:28:46,412 --> 00:28:47,520
Scott: if everyone plays perfectly.

650
00:28:48,161 --> 00:28:50,319
Scott: Unlike spot it, which is sort of like, it's gonna end.

651
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:57,720
Rym: Now, the concept is great and we know it is because when we played, some of the questions, like everyone would be like, ugh.

652
00:28:58,641 --> 00:29:01,029
Rym: Just like spot it, your brain would freeze.

653
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:04,160
Rym: Your adult brain would say, wait a minute, I'm actually a baby.

654
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,467
Rym: And that part is really fun.

655
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:08,960
Rym: Like you get questions like, what's a really good one?

656
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,859
Rym: Because some of the questions are kind of dumb.

657
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,400
Scott: The ones that have a lot of double negatives.

658
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,149
Rym: Yep.

659
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,459
Scott: Stuff like that.

660
00:29:14,621 --> 00:29:15,819
Rym: The opposite of false is true.

661
00:29:17,962 --> 00:29:20,120
Rym: At least two players are wearing shoes with no laces.

662
00:29:21,001 --> 00:29:22,119
Rym: I'm reading the card in English.

663
00:29:23,521 --> 00:29:25,140
Rym: The table we are playing on is round.

664
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,640
Rym: Ah, now that's where the problems begin.

665
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:31,160
Scott: Right, a lot of these questions have assumptions built into them.

666
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,520
Scott: We weren't playing on a table, we were playing on the floor.

667
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:39,120
Scott: So what does that question even, you know, should it be, you know, obviously it's not true because we're not playing on a table.

668
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:40,960
Scott: But it's not false either.

669
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:46,240
Rym: Well it is because logically the statement is false because one portion of it is false.

670
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,751
Scott: Yeah, it's tough though.

671
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,040
Rym: However, that's fine because that we could argue.

672
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:58,200
Rym: But some of the questions have a problem that they will specify what the actual answer is.

673
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,840
Rym: They'll put a little T or a little F next to it.

674
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:06,940
Scott: Because they think, the people who made this game, that no matter what that question will always be true or always be false.

675
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,660
Scott: Sometimes this is the case.

676
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:10,799
Scott: Sometimes it is actually not.

677
00:30:10,981 --> 00:30:13,940
Rym: For example, green is made by mixing blue and yellow.

678
00:30:14,182 --> 00:30:16,160
Rym: They say this is always true, but wait a minute.

679
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:16,933
Scott: Not if it's light.

680
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:17,808
Rym: Are we talking about pigments?

681
00:30:17,828 --> 00:30:18,740
Rym: Are we talking about light?

682
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:23,860
Scott: Exactly, we're too smart so that we know better that, you know, you can make a really good argument.

683
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,420
Scott: And basically it's a bullshit question.

684
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,380
Rym: Or at this table, alright, we already don't have a table.

685
00:30:28,903 --> 00:30:31,080
Rym: There are as many mouths as there are noses.

686
00:30:31,521 --> 00:30:33,260
Rym: What if someone lost their nose in NOM?

687
00:30:33,521 --> 00:30:34,220
Rym: Now what game?

688
00:30:34,622 --> 00:30:34,999
Scott: Exactly.

689
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,519
Scott: What if someone has two noses?

690
00:30:37,121 --> 00:30:44,340
Scott: What if there's like, you know, one of those funny glasses with the nose built onto it sitting on the table?

691
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:45,880
Scott: That's an extra nose.

692
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:46,920
Rym: Oh, there's a good one though.

693
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,779
Rym: This is not the first half of the year.

694
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:53,480
Rym: And the first letter of the state we are in is in the first ten letters of the alphabet.

695
00:30:56,143 --> 00:30:57,440
Scott: See, those are good ones, right?

696
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:00,480
Scott: Ones where there's no ambiguity, there's no argument to be made.

697
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,480
Scott: It's true or false.

698
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:04,980
Scott: Some of these, right, there was one that wasn't even true or false.

699
00:31:05,401 --> 00:31:06,360
Scott: It was like a command.

700
00:31:06,461 --> 00:31:09,080
Rym: Yeah, it was like slam both your hands down at the same time.

701
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,520
Scott: Well it's like, well wait a minute, that's not a true or false statement.

702
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:12,718
Scott: That's bullshit.

703
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:16,100
Rym: Also, some of them are predicated upon the future.

704
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,900
Rym: So I realized that I could retroactively change the result of the game.

705
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,740
Rym: One of them was, you are sleeping here tonight.

706
00:31:23,262 --> 00:31:23,398
Scott: Yep.

707
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,780
Rym: So we had some friends who were actually sleeping over, but Scott wasn't sleeping over.

708
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:30,540
Rym: But he could have said true and then said, alright, yeah, I am going to stay the night.

709
00:31:31,062 --> 00:31:33,200
Rym: Or, what if I didn't let him stay the night?

710
00:31:33,421 --> 00:31:36,895
Scott: Or, what if something happened later and people weren't able to sleep there?

711
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,780
Scott: You know, you never know what's going to happen.

712
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:44,880
Scott: So you can't make true or false statements about the future unless, you know, psychic powers are real.

713
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:50,340
Rym: Now the other trouble is that the way the game is written, it doesn't have all the game modes like Spot It did.

714
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:56,840
Rym: So the game kind of peters out and then you're going to rapidly have the same questions over and over again as the game goes towards its conclusion.

715
00:31:56,962 --> 00:31:58,319
Scott: Well that's another flaw in the game, right?

716
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:06,440
Scott: Everyone's dealt these cards at the beginning of the game and you cycle through those cards and each card does have five questions, but you don't choose which question to ask.

717
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,700
Scott: It's determined by the color of the previous card.

718
00:32:09,141 --> 00:32:18,960
Scott: So if you keep playing and you don't suck, right, then what happens is you keep asking the same questions over and over again and you don't draw any new cards.

719
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:29,340
Scott: To get new questions, you would have to play again a new game with new cards or bring in some sort of house rule where you can throw away cards you have already and draw new ones and stuff like that.

720
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:37,320
Scott: But it's not in the official rules, so yeah, the rules are flawed in that you don't get fresh questions and eventually you're doing the same things over and over again.

721
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:48,100
Rym: Which is actually, you know, apples to apples has a similar problem that everyone uses their good cards and then if the game goes on too long, everyone has nothing but a bunch of shit proper nouns and everyone's just bored and waiting for the game to end.

722
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:52,995
Scott: That's why you get to get so many expansions, but even if you get so many expansions, it's not like they're all good cards in there.

723
00:32:53,116 --> 00:32:54,440
Scott: You still get a handful of crap cards.

724
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,480
Rym: The real answer is you gotta make your own apples to apples.

725
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:57,000
Scott: Yeah.

726
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:04,439
Rym: But the other problem with the rules is that the way it works, you can't really get ahead, you can basically just hold out.

727
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,479
Scott: Already discussed that, yeah.

728
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:11,700
Rym: But there's a way around that in that maybe you just don't answer any questions, then you can never fall behind.

729
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,660
Scott: Well, I think, see the way I interpret it is that you have to put a hand down, right?

730
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,121
Scott: It

731
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:21,598
Rym: doesn't specify a time limit, so I can just wait until everyone's done, sit there, fully consider the question, then very slowly go,

732
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:21,979
Rym: "Eh."

733
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:33,799
Scott: Yeah, I'm fine with that, but I feel like you have to put a hand down because let's say everyone puts a correct hand down, no one's saying anything, you still have to think about it and decide if it's right hand or what to do.

734
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:39,740
Rym: But the way the questions are, given 30 seconds to think, you're guaranteed to not fuck it up.

735
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:40,213
Scott: I know.

736
00:33:41,847 --> 00:33:43,660
Scott: So... Unless it's one of those stupid ambiguous questions.

737
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,958
Rym: What this game is, if I had to encapsulate it in a word, is lazy.

738
00:33:48,445 --> 00:33:49,460
Rym: Not broken, I'm gonna say lazy.

739
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,158
Scott: I'm gonna say broken.

740
00:33:50,681 --> 00:33:53,380
Rym: Well, yeah, it is broken, but it's only broken due to laziness.

741
00:33:53,800 --> 00:34:04,920
Rym: The concept is really solid, and it could have been great, they just didn't even put half a fucking ass into the questions they put on it, and they didn't actually think about the mechanics.

742
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,860
Rym: It's like they didn't actually playtest this game.

743
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:12,860
Rym: I cannot imagine adults playing this game for more than two seconds without running into a question they can't answer from the rules.

744
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:28,120
Scott: Yeah, you could take this exact same ruleset, add a rule for maybe switching cards out or drawing cards or something like that, like when you win you draw a card or who knows, and then clarify the rule about do you have to answer or not.

745
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,378
Rym: Maybe do something like...

746
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:33,139
Scott: And then get rid of any ambiguous question and only put in the good questions.

747
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:38,940
Rym: Yep, like one way, maybe you make a rule like the last person to put their hand down gets some penalty to force people to move quickly.

748
00:34:39,641 --> 00:34:43,030
Scott: The game could be fixed with a significant effort.

749
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,292
Scott: It could be an okay game.

750
00:34:44,353 --> 00:34:47,500
Scott: It still wouldn't be as good as Spotted though, even if all those problems are solved.

751
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:56,960
Rym: I don't know, I think it could be because the few rounds where the question was good and there was no ambiguity had the exact same brainfeel as Spotted.

752
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,460
Scott: Yeah, but I think Spotted is just... you can't compete with Spotted.

753
00:35:00,941 --> 00:35:01,542
Rym: I think you could.

754
00:35:01,562 --> 00:35:06,570
Rym: Like I said, this game is broken, but it's broken due to nothing more than laziness.

755
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:12,840
Rym: This could have easily been a really fun game, but instead, as it is, I would not buy this game if I were you.

756
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,460
Scott: No, we're not going to be having ten copies giving them away.

757
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,739
Rym: I'm going to try to fix it.

758
00:35:17,502 --> 00:35:18,840
Scott: You had to make all new cards.

759
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:25,300
Rym: No, I can't fix the questions, but I'm going to try to figure out a way to at least fix the mechanics, because I think the concept is solid.

760
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,329
Rym: Maybe I swap it instead of putting your hands down.

761
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:30,151
Rym: There's a totem.

762
00:35:30,171 --> 00:35:31,975
Rym: I don't know, I'll come up with something.

763
00:35:32,757 --> 00:35:33,960
Rym: I'll make like a trigger mod.

764
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:34,773
Scott: Sure.

765
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:41,100
Rym: So the other game we'll talk about, because Scott finally beat it so we can talk about it, is Bobo.

766
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,666
Scott: Bobo's Big Adventure.

767
00:35:42,686 --> 00:35:43,512
Scott: It's a Flash game.

768
00:35:43,533 --> 00:35:44,439
Scott: You can play it for free.

769
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:49,820
Scott: So basically, we saw a trailer for this game, and I didn't realize it was a Flash game at the time.

770
00:35:50,301 --> 00:35:51,960
Rym: I was so pumped when I saw that trailer.

771
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:57,660
Scott: Yeah, but the trailer, it's basically this incredibly crazy homage to the old NES games, right?

772
00:35:59,022 --> 00:36:01,420
Scott: And each level is an homage to a different game.

773
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:07,700
Scott: So there's a balloon fighter level, there's a double dragon level, a Zelda level, a Mega Man level.

774
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:18,780
Scott: There's all these levels, and each level, urban champion level, each one is modeled after an old NES game, and each one also includes a bunch of elements from other NES games.

775
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,518
Scott: So in the double dragon level, you're walking down, there's a Goomba, and you kick it.

776
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:28,940
Scott: Or like, you know, in the swimming Mario level, there's also that Ninja Turtle, you know, electric seaweed shit going on.

777
00:36:29,181 --> 00:36:33,579
Rym: And a door that takes you to a room, all Goonies 2 style, where the mermaid is there.

778
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,460
Rym: Yeah, it's like every- And all I have to say is, Scott, you should have picked "Mate" as the option.

779
00:36:38,701 --> 00:36:41,094
Scott: I did the second time I played it.

780
00:36:41,316 --> 00:36:41,959
Scott: Because you told me.

781
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,735
Rym: See how she makes a good face, like after that?

782
00:36:44,775 --> 00:36:45,440
Scott: Like it's a funny face.

783
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,255
Scott: Yeah, she's like, "Hey,

784
00:36:46,275 --> 00:36:46,397
Scott: baby.".

785
00:36:48,001 --> 00:36:55,220
Scott: Yeah, so in terms of the theme, right, the game is just really fun, because it somehow manages to throw in all this stuff just blatantly.

786
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:10,960
Scott: And usually that comes off as fanboyish and amateurish, but they manage to have it come off as like clever and quality, partly because just, you know, the way they put the pixel art in there is just really, you know, well done and professional, and it's not just sort of like slapped together like a crappy sprite comic.

787
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:14,680
Rym: Well, I like when you're brawling, how the guy actually can't hurt you.

788
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,086
Rym: Yeah.

789
00:37:15,361 --> 00:37:16,879
Rym: Like he just sucks and you can just kill him.

790
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:25,698
Rym: There's so many, like it's clever, and the second, it's very well constructed, the very second one of the jokes gets old, you're already moving on to the next thing.

791
00:37:26,481 --> 00:37:28,373
Rym: Like right when you're like, "Okay, I get it.

792
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:28,917
Rym: Oh, there's something

793
00:37:28,957 --> 00:37:29,058
Rym: new.".

794
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:41,960
Rym: The only problem with it was, and it's not really a problem for everyone, so I can't really hold it against the game, and it's also a good thing, it gives you the feel for like what Nintendo hard was like, but it's not really a Nintendo hard by any means.

795
00:37:42,362 --> 00:37:45,700
Rym: I beat it in basically one go, like it was super easy.

796
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:56,820
Scott: Yeah, I mean the first time I tried to play it, I was using, you know, I just couldn't get past the electric water part, but then, you know, Rym told me to use the mate option instead of the other option, so the second time I played it, I was pretty much able to beat it.

797
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,280
Scott: You gotta continue sometimes, they give you plenty of continues.

798
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,180
Rym: Yeah, well once you put in the Konami code, you're pretty much set.

799
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:22,800
Scott: Yeah, right, and it's just, actually I accidentally enabled in the Contra level, I accidentally enabled two player mode, which basically doesn't work, because they switch all the controls on you, so I sort of had to die on purpose to then, because I couldn't shoot, because I couldn't figure out what button did the shooting, because the screen that tells you the controls for two player mode disappeared, and I didn't have a second player,

800
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,524
Rym: so I had to

801
00:38:24,544 --> 00:38:28,460
Scott: die on purpose and continue, and then use Konami code single player, so I could shoot everybody.

802
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:41,160
Rym: But my complaint is just that the game was actually really too easy, and when I saw the trailer, I thought, I'm going to play that game and beat it, like I'm going to hard card, and it wasn't really hard card.

803
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:45,539
Scott: Yeah, beat it in like an hour, once I actually put the effort in to try to beat it.

804
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:55,700
Rym: It's more like a sort of comedy homage that has gameplay to remind you what that gameplay is like, but it's not a hard game, you should totally, everyone should just play it.

805
00:38:56,641 --> 00:39:06,200
Rym: If you're even reasonably skilled at games, you'll beat it pretty easily, not in one go, but without too much, you're not going to bang your head against the wall, there's no Super Meat Boy.

806
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,118
Scott: There were some things that bothered me, for example...

807
00:39:08,421 --> 00:39:10,360
Rym: No secrets in the Zelda level really pissed me off.

808
00:39:10,961 --> 00:39:18,260
Scott: Yeah, there was, what's it called, in the Balloon Fighter level, the controls were tight, felt like Balloon Fighter, exactly, right?

809
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:23,240
Scott: Zelda level, even though there were no secrets, the controls were exactly like Zelda, perfect, right?

810
00:39:23,621 --> 00:39:26,179
Scott: But the Mega Man level, the controls are way off, right?

811
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:43,140
Scott: It's like you put the effort in to get those other levels to match the original games, but Mega Man's all loosey-goosey, you can't even, and they put the Piranha Plant bad guy there, you couldn't possibly, and then the Gizmo Duck, it's like you can't kill him before he hits you, and there's nowhere to stand, it's like, why did you design it like that?

812
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,140
Scott: You should have just moved him back like a square or two, it would have been just fine.

813
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,260
Rym: Yeah, because the hallmark of Mega Man games is that you can avoid everything unless you suck.

814
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,840
Scott: Right, so that Mega Man level had a couple poor design problems in it.

815
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,000
Rym: It made up for it by being really derpy easy.

816
00:39:57,321 --> 00:40:01,580
Scott: Oh, yeah, but I mean, it was still just annoying that it's like, oh, you kind of screwed this up, guys.

817
00:40:02,021 --> 00:40:16,528
Rym: I was very pleased, spoilers, but whatever, that at the end, it was, you know, Little Mac was the bad guy, like he was the square boss, and the fact that then you fight him, and you're the bad guy in the perspective, and you're playing, like, you're playing

818
00:40:16,568 --> 00:40:17,030
Rym: Punch-Out!,

819
00:40:17,491 --> 00:40:19,680
Rym: but you're controlling the big guy on the other side.

820
00:40:19,801 --> 00:40:21,159
Scott: Yeah, that's just- That was great.

821
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:21,860
Scott: That was genius.

822
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:26,860
Scott: You know, that's the kind of thing where it's one of those, like, why doesn't the Pokémon MMO exist?

823
00:40:27,142 --> 00:40:28,653
Scott: Why isn't there a game where it's Punch-Out!

824
00:40:28,673 --> 00:40:29,700
Scott: and you're the bad guy, right?

825
00:40:29,842 --> 00:40:29,955
Scott: Yeah.

826
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,273
Scott: There it is, there's a game where it's Punch-Out!

827
00:40:31,293 --> 00:40:31,920
Scott: and you're the bad guy.

828
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,856
Scott: I almost wish they would make an entire game a Punch-Out!

829
00:40:34,876 --> 00:40:35,520
Scott: where you're the bad guy.

830
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,499
Rym: That'd be really fun.

831
00:40:36,742 --> 00:40:37,420
Scott: Yeah, that'd be the greatest.

832
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,338
Rym: Really fun.

833
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:41,680
Scott: And you could choose different guys, different moves, and all kinds of stuff.

834
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:49,160
Rym: But Abobo was, the one thing is, like, you play this whole game and Abobo's a fucker the whole way, he's murdering kids and killing people.

835
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,580
Scott: Right, he's a bad guy, he's a bad guy from Double Dragon.

836
00:40:51,840 --> 00:41:02,300
Rym: Yeah, but toward the end, the game kind of lulled me into the sense of, like, you know, I'm playing Abobo, I'm the hero, and then at the end, it's actually kind of a gross cutscene, but you get this cutscene where they just go apeshit and kill everybody.

837
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,200
Scott: Yeah, because you're the bad guy, you're the bad guy just won.

838
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:05,819
Rym: Yeah, Abobo is a horrible person.

839
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,360
Scott: But then again, Little Mac was also a horrible person.

840
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,438
Rym: Yeah, so two horrible people fought, and the more horrible one, won.

841
00:41:13,468 --> 00:41:13,616
Scott: Sure.

842
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,440
Rym: Because Abobo is the most horrible.

843
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:16,036
Rym: He is.

844
00:41:17,122 --> 00:41:17,819
Rym: But it was super fun.

845
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,760
Rym: The thing is, I thought I was going to buy the NES, like, controller thing to play Abobo.

846
00:41:22,921 --> 00:41:24,239
Scott: I have it, I used it.

847
00:41:24,501 --> 00:41:27,439
Rym: But you can totally just beat it with the keyboard, because it's not that hard.

848
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:27,838
Scott: Yeah.

849
00:41:29,163 --> 00:41:30,720
Scott: And the Joy 2 Key is such bullshit.

850
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:31,520
Rym: Fuck Joy 2 Key.

851
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,879
Scott: I mean, that thing's such a piece of shit.

852
00:41:33,221 --> 00:41:33,720
Scott: Oh my god.

853
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,477
Scott: I think I'm going to try to write a replacement for Joy 2 Key.

854
00:41:37,497 --> 00:41:38,060
Scott: that doesn't suck.

855
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:38,899
Scott: Because it's awful.

856
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,259
Scott: It should die in a fire.

857
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:40,644
Scott: Yup.

858
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,019
Scott: It's an open source too, so you can trust it.

859
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:43,416
Scott: Yeah.

860
00:41:43,861 --> 00:41:44,698
Rym: But not for Macs.

861
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,060
Scott: So if you're an NES fan, you know, go back and play Abobo.

862
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:53,380
Scott: If you're not an NES type of person, I actually think you probably shouldn't play it.

863
00:41:53,481 --> 00:41:54,240
Rym: It won't make any sense.

864
00:41:54,481 --> 00:41:55,659
Rym: It won't make any sense.

865
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,060
Rym: It would be like watching Excel Saga if you'd never seen anime before.

866
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:06,320
Scott: Right, so what you should do instead is you should, you know, get the list of, like, the 9 or 10 games that are, you know, homaged.

867
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,179
Scott: Mostly, like, the big ones that are homaged.

868
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,200
Rym: Mega Man, Balloon Fighter.

869
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,360
Scott: Mega Man, Balloon Fighter, Zelda, Double Dragon.

870
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,440
Rym: That wrestling game.

871
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:20,781
Scott: Urban Champion, Pro Wrestling, Punch Out, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 1.

872
00:42:20,781 --> 00:42:21,678
Scott: What are the other ones?

873
00:42:22,288 --> 00:42:22,979
Rym: Uh, that's enough.

874
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,040
Scott: I mean, uh, DuckTales, whatever.

875
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,692
Scott: You know, just play those, and Mario 2, right?

876
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,360
Scott: Play those, Mario 3.

877
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,740
Rym: Oh, speaking of which, that aside, play DuckTales on the NES.

878
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,000
Rym: That's one of the greatest games ever.

879
00:42:35,181 --> 00:42:36,880
Rym: Mario 1.

880
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:44,060
Scott: Play all those games, you know, learn, you know, just get the feel for them, beat Mario 3, or else what the hell, and Mega Man 2.

881
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,518
Scott: And then play Abobo and you'll be able to appreciate it.

882
00:42:47,682 --> 00:42:48,799
Scott: I wish they would have made a Metroid level.

883
00:42:49,546 --> 00:42:49,900
Rym: Oh, yeah.

884
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,779
Scott: Well, there were a lot of things done.

885
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,319
Scott: Castlevania level.

886
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:54,660
Rym: I wish they'd done, but they had homage to a lot of those things.

887
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,420
Scott: They did, but they didn't have levels for them.

888
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:56,939
Scott: Metal Gear level.

889
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,759
Rym: Did you find the SNM torture porn room?

890
00:43:00,502 --> 00:43:01,440
Scott: Uh, don't, maybe.

891
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:02,319
Scott: I don't know.

892
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,180
Scott: Maybe I did, maybe I didn't.

893
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,940
Rym: The room where, like, Luigi's in there, and the princess, and the girls with whips from Double Dragon.

894
00:43:07,468 --> 00:43:07,597
Scott: No.

895
00:43:08,023 --> 00:43:08,259
Rym: Really?

896
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,337
Rym: So, remember in Double Dragon, in the first level, there's that place where you can walk up the wall?

897
00:43:13,683 --> 00:43:13,939
Rym: Yes.

898
00:43:14,201 --> 00:43:15,679
Rym: If you walk all the way up the wall, it's up there.

899
00:43:16,484 --> 00:43:16,527
Scott: Oh.

900
00:43:17,982 --> 00:43:25,520
Rym: That was great, because the fact that they had that walk up the wall, that glitchy bullshit there, and that they did a thing in there, that was brilliant.

901
00:43:27,723 --> 00:43:27,959
Scott: Okay.

902
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:28,358
Scott: Alright.

903
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,036
Rym: That was it.

904
00:43:29,241 --> 00:43:29,540
Rym: I'm tired.

905
00:43:29,683 --> 00:43:29,900
Scott: I'm hungry.

906
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:30,437
Scott: Yeah, let's go.

907
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,420
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

908
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:43,540
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

909
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,960
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

910
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,880
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

911
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:56,640
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

912
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,136
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

913
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:04,420
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

914
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,560
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
