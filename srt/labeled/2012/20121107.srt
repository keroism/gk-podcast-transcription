9
00:00:37,874 --> 00:00:39,219
Rym: Maybe more so.

10
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:45,958

11
00:00:46,385 --> 00:00:52,349
Rym: Okay I also because I did not get breakfast bought a banana And I put the banana in my pocket.

12
00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:54,477
Scott: because how much do they sell a banana for at Starbucks?

13
00:00:54,537 --> 00:00:55,180
Rym: like a dollar.

14
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:56,869
Scott: Why don't you buy one from the street guy?

15
00:00:56,889 --> 00:00:57,934
Scott: Who's like 50 cent or 25 cent?

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,913
Rym: There's no street guy open when I get to my office anywhere near my office.

17
00:01:03,134 --> 00:01:04,599
Scott: You can get fruits all near my office.

18
00:01:05,182 --> 00:01:06,287
Rym: Also, I don't have to walk anywhere.

19
00:01:06,328 --> 00:01:08,116
Rym: this subway stops like right there, but anyway.

20
00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:08,860
Rym: I bought a banana.

21
00:01:09,432 --> 00:01:12,367
Scott: Okay Overpriced Starbucks banana.

22
00:01:12,467 --> 00:01:14,980
Rym: my hands are full so I put it in my pocket of my leather jacket.

23
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:16,997
Rym: I went into work, and I forgot I had the banana.

24
00:01:17,017 --> 00:01:23,220
Rym: I Realized today, I'm sitting at work, and I'm like wait a minute didn't I buy a banana?

00:01:24,504 --> 00:01:25,513
Rym: And I reach in my pocket.

26
00:01:25,573 --> 00:01:26,158
Rym: It's not there.

27
00:01:27,244 --> 00:01:29,974
Scott: Are you sure you didn't drop the banana out the pocket.

28
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:31,340
Rym: if you look at those pockets?

29
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:38,220
Rym: There's a flap and they're really deep there's and there was also a moleskine and my wallet in the same pocket.

30
00:01:38,782 --> 00:01:41,735
Scott: I start you sure you didn't eat the banana and forgot you ate the banana.

31
00:01:42,037 --> 00:01:44,687
Rym: I'm Food is very important to me in my life.

32
00:01:44,788 --> 00:01:50,958
Rym: the odds of me forgetting that I ate anything pretty low Are you sure?

33
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,390
Scott: that you were like?

34
00:01:52,431 --> 00:01:59,620
Scott: you know you Like did you look when you put the banana in the pocket or just sort of feel you put the banana pot because you might Have felt like you put the bit in the pocket back?

35
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,791
Scott: She's dropping it on the ground.

36
00:02:00,811 --> 00:02:02,824
Rym: so I've done that before With other things.

37
00:02:02,884 --> 00:02:07,360
Rym: in fact I had a pair of jeans where the left pocket if you put anything in it immediately fell into my pant.

38
00:02:08,321 --> 00:02:17,791
Rym: So uh no I am sure because not only did I lift the flap and like put it in and then think uh-oh What if I crushed this banana against my moleskine?

39
00:02:18,212 --> 00:02:18,935
Rym: Oh, don't worry.

40
00:02:18,955 --> 00:02:20,460
Rym: I won't forget the bananas there.

41
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:24,017
Scott: Are you sure you didn't do some sort of you know?

42
00:02:25,701 --> 00:02:29,220
Scott: Move to avert that situation and forgot the move you made.

43
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,733
Rym: There's only so many pockets in the and I went back to.

44
00:02:32,793 --> 00:02:37,039
Rym: so basically I had this moment of There is a banana on the loose.

45
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,620
Rym: That is a dangerous situation.

46
00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:42,268
Rym: So I checked every pocket no banana.

47
00:02:43,011 --> 00:02:44,396
Rym: I looked around my desk at work.

48
00:02:44,477 --> 00:02:45,139
Rym: No banana.

49
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:49,012
Rym: I Went into the closet at work and looked around no banana.

50
00:02:49,414 --> 00:02:50,840
Rym: I didn't see a banana at any point.

51
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:52,820
Scott: So now you're a pickpocket of the banana.

52
00:02:53,364 --> 00:03:01,380
Rym: I thought about that, but my wallet was in the same pocket And I still really shitty pickpocket or really hungry, so there's a banana on the loose.

53
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:06,207
Rym: So I implore you GeekNights listeners if any of you find my banana I would like you to let me

54
00:03:06,247 --> 00:03:07,051
Scott: know it's in your pants

55
00:03:07,433 --> 00:03:13,757
Rym: because if you find my banana It means that you are a goddamn stalker, and I really need to know your name, so I can tell the police

56
00:03:14,178 --> 00:03:14,540
Scott: also.

57
00:03:15,882 --> 00:03:17,292
Scott: You can find the banana easily.

58
00:03:17,352 --> 00:03:18,359
Scott: just look for the fruit flies.

59
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,085
Rym: Also, that's what I want to avoid.

60
00:03:21,105 --> 00:03:26,399
Rym: I don't want to find fruit flies because then I will find the banana also bit too late.

61
00:03:27,721 --> 00:03:36,719
Rym: banana banana banana God dang I don't think anyone who listens to the show will understand what you were referred to.

62
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:41,260
Scott: fine I think everyone was banana waiting in fact.

63
00:03:42,362 --> 00:03:46,819
Rym: Then until this second at least one listener thought you were very poorly referencing that.

64
00:03:48,782 --> 00:03:50,490
Rym: Nope so it's Wednesday now.

65
00:03:50,611 --> 00:03:51,515
Rym: What do you got for me?

66
00:03:52,118 --> 00:03:52,319
Scott: so?

67
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,796
Scott: The other day we were discussing what to do the show on about.

68
00:03:57,936 --> 00:04:00,726
Scott: today now It's a Monday night.

69
00:04:00,927 --> 00:04:03,700
Scott: after the Monday show we're like what should we do on the Wednesday?

70
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,478
Rym: And I was like well Scott you had me reread Gotham Central, so let's do the show on.

71
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:08,867
Scott: well you I had you read it.

72
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,720
Scott: I was supposed to reread it.

73
00:04:10,861 --> 00:04:13,072
Rym: I had read the first one before but I didn't read the rest.

74
00:04:13,113 --> 00:04:17,019
Scott: for some I have not Reread it so we cannot do a show.

75
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,750
Rym: I can't in any way blame you because I've been the person causing the.

76
00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:23,440
Rym: oh, I didn't read it yet it more times.

77
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:26,188
Scott: Also, I'm playing ns2 you can't you know?

78
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,260
Rym: yeah, so we were like alright, let's do what we did before.

79
00:04:29,341 --> 00:04:38,010
Rym: Let's get some anime and watch it and rather than rely Just like we did on the last Wednesday episode about one piece rather than rely on the you know Bit torrent or wait a minute.

80
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,740
Rym: Are you sure this thing's only an hour long?

81
00:04:40,701 --> 00:04:47,236
Rym: We I have a bunch of DVDs like a nice high kick silent service great elf princess rain.

82
00:04:48,242 --> 00:04:50,748
Scott: So new Rym suggests some tenchi muyo av.

83
00:04:50,788 --> 00:04:51,751
Scott: so I don't know.

84
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:54,378
Rym: no no I suggested the tenchi muyo movies.

85
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:59,219
Rym: now the problem is Tenchi muyo movie number one actually really good.

86
00:05:00,187 --> 00:05:06,239
Rym: Not an hour long Tenchi movie - actually an hour long involves incest.

87
00:05:07,581 --> 00:05:10,271
Rym: Okay, so we had to pick something else.

88
00:05:10,472 --> 00:05:12,520
Rym: so we talked about tension el hazard situation.

89
00:05:12,601 --> 00:05:14,960
Scott: But isn't that the same guy so Scott suggested?

90
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,410
Scott: Maybe jokingly because he was already suggesting all these tenchi things.

91
00:05:18,931 --> 00:05:27,157
Scott: I jokingly suggested tenchi muyo gxp Which if you don't know if we have talked about it in the distant past terrible.

92
00:05:27,518 --> 00:05:28,060
Scott: It's awful.

93
00:05:28,181 --> 00:05:31,193
Scott: We watched this in anime club when it was brand fucking new.

94
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:32,720
Scott: we watched like four episodes.

95
00:05:32,861 --> 00:05:33,866
Scott: I think I only watch one.

96
00:05:34,087 --> 00:05:36,760
Rym: I walked out after the first episode because I was.

97
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:43,260
Scott: That point is the worst show with the best opening song of any show ever like that.

98
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,676
Scott: I'm not saying it has the best opening song of any way ever.

99
00:05:46,997 --> 00:05:53,075
Scott: I'm saying The goodness of the opening song compared to the shittiness of the show is the largest gap.

100
00:05:53,376 --> 00:05:59,380
Rym: now to put that into perspective Dot hack sign and noir have really good opening songs.

101
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,369
Rym: They do pretty bad shows.

102
00:06:01,972 --> 00:06:03,860
Rym: the disparity here is greater.

103
00:06:04,061 --> 00:06:07,695
Rym: Yeah, basically because the primarily because of how bad you know the opening song bow time.

104
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,357
Scott: It's like the opening song is pretty good.

105
00:06:10,397 --> 00:06:16,825
Rym: like I Love that song so much.

106
00:06:16,905 --> 00:06:21,327
Scott: It's a good song, but the show is so Shitty.

107
00:06:21,408 --> 00:06:26,374
Scott: seriously, I'm talking worse Photon bad definitely ready how to smack your mama.

108
00:06:26,394 --> 00:06:27,480
Rym: so here's the deal.

109
00:06:27,882 --> 00:06:31,280
Rym: It's bad right, but it's bad in like this extra way.

110
00:06:31,441 --> 00:06:39,113
Rym: So if you haven't seen any other tenchi muyo, and you watch this It's just this terrible fucking anime if you have seen tenchi muyo.

111
00:06:39,173 --> 00:06:44,420
Rym: It's even worse because you're watching thinking alright It's tenchi, so it must take place in the tenchi universe.

112
00:06:44,962 --> 00:06:50,125
Rym: I think once like one of the real tenchi characters flies by in the background And you're like.

113
00:06:50,145 --> 00:06:52,799
Rym: that is literally the best thing that's happened in this show.

114
00:06:53,655 --> 00:06:58,716
Rym: so My surprise god is this better or worse than photon in your?

115
00:06:58,777 --> 00:07:01,150
Scott: I didn't see photon So I went to.

116
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,699
Scott: I've only seen photon on the TV.

117
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:09,340
Rym: What is worse watch an episode of photon and an episode of tenchi muyo.

118
00:07:09,923 --> 00:07:11,853
Scott: Even have episodes isn't it just one disc.

119
00:07:11,913 --> 00:07:13,180
Scott: I've only ever seen one disc.

120
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:16,200
Rym: I've only ever seen the trailer and I knew better.

121
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:17,304
Scott: I saw an immediate plate.

122
00:07:17,324 --> 00:07:19,131
Scott: was one disc photons below that line.

123
00:07:19,171 --> 00:07:30,391
Rym: like I always say the second worst movie ever made is Well the worst movie ever made is Clifford with Martin short playing a ten-year-old boy Because below that there are worse movies that I knew better than to watch.

124
00:07:30,953 --> 00:07:32,177
Rym: I knew better than to watch.

125
00:07:32,197 --> 00:07:34,829
Scott: so tenchi muyo Gxp imagine my surprise.

126
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:52,320
Scott: I go to look for news for this show You know in this morning, and I noticed that on November 3rd this year only four days before this recording Cartoon Network has announced they're gonna have tenchi muyo Gxp added to their adult swim lineup.

127
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,845
Rym: What really?

128
00:07:53,865 --> 00:07:55,229
Scott: here's the schedule.

129
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:58,560
Rym: we cause that through some sort of like reverse synchronicity.

130
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,927
Scott: Here's the adult swim schedule midnight.

131
00:08:01,007 --> 00:08:01,388

139
00:08:17,693 --> 00:08:23,120
Rym: here's the problem with Why anime is not doing so well in the mainstream?

140
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:32,774
Scott: Because that's the fucking lineup and the only shows in there that are halfway good or being 26 episodes and they're rotating through them a hundred times because that lineup isn't right after school.

141
00:08:33,256 --> 00:08:33,977
Scott: That's also true.

142
00:08:33,998 --> 00:08:34,840

00:08:51,903 --> 00:08:52,585
Scott: no one's gonna.

149
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:59,874
Scott: if some new anime fan happens to have insomnia and can't go to sleep and ends up by the Cartoon Network, they're not gonna make it to cowboy bebop guys.

00:09:00,055 --> 00:09:01,766
Rym: Yeah 4 a.m You're.

151
00:09:01,988 --> 00:09:05,539
Rym: if you are awake at 4 a.m Something has gone horribly wrong in your life.

152
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:09,679
Scott: Or maybe you're just most people with a really early job and you watch it like in the morning when you wake up.

153
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:17,083
Rym: Yeah, but if you're up and awake and have a half hour to kill watching an entire episode of anime Something's going.

154
00:09:17,143 --> 00:09:21,360
Scott: maybe you wake up and eat your breakfast like at 4 30 with the second coffee above episode.

155
00:09:21,462 --> 00:09:27,120
Rym: I'll be not bad Time to go to watching cowboy bebop again, that wouldn't be so bad.

156
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:34,480
Rym: So if you're up at 3 in the morning and you're watching Fullmetal Alchemist brotherhood, it's an up all night party.

157
00:09:34,701 --> 00:09:37,610
Rym: I actually haven't seen Eureka seven and Thundercats is shit.

158
00:09:37,691 --> 00:09:38,253
Scott: I find it funny.

159
00:09:38,273 --> 00:09:39,176
Scott: They have samurai seven.

160
00:09:39,196 --> 00:09:40,460
Scott: Wait a minute Thundercats.

161
00:09:40,601 --> 00:09:42,088
Scott: Well, wait, is this the new Thundercats?

162
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:44,500
Rym: or do you really think it's the old Thundercats?

163
00:09:45,381 --> 00:09:47,600
Scott: Do you really think that I thought it was the old one?

164
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,765
Rym: Okay, the new Thundercats looks great.

165
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:54,500
Rym: If you watch the new Thundercats with no sound and no sub the titles.

166
00:09:54,881 --> 00:09:55,543
Rym: It's pretty great.

167
00:09:55,563 --> 00:09:57,911
Scott: But anyway, they have samurai seven and Eureka seven.

168
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,659
Scott: They need to add in blue sub.

169
00:10:04,134 --> 00:10:06,666
Scott: Anyway Do you have any sort of news?

170
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:15,840
Rym: So since we brought up tenchi muyo, you know tenchi muyo It's interesting how when I was like are like a huge fan of anime.

171
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,218
Rym: I mean, I've been a fan of anime since in the 90s since I was in fourth grade in the 90s.

172
00:10:21,182 --> 00:10:23,813
Scott: Yeah, when I'm she muyo was a big deal in the u.s.

173
00:10:23,954 --> 00:10:25,460
Scott: I don't know how big a deal it was in Japan.

174
00:10:25,601 --> 00:10:27,528
Scott: I assume it was at least a moderate deal when I.

175
00:10:27,548 --> 00:10:34,560
Rym: but that's based on when I was nothing when I was in fourth grade And I saw a vampire hundred because my mom forced me to I became a huge fan of anime.

176
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:45,080
Rym: But when I got involved in anime culture Which did not happen until long after that because they're really I saw anime before I had access to the internet.

177
00:10:45,942 --> 00:10:56,040
Rym: So when I finally got on the internet and discovered there was this whole anime culture and like anime conventions and all this bullshit Tenchi muyo among anime fans was the biggest goddamn thing ever.

178
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,820
Scott: Well, I mean, here's how it went, right?

179
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:02,240
Scott: So you could watch Sailor Moon and stuff like that and syndicated local TV.

180
00:11:02,481 --> 00:11:04,388
Scott: But once you got Cartoon Network, you could drop.

181
00:11:04,448 --> 00:11:05,010
Rym: now that out.

182
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:07,620
Rym: you could drop 40 bucks to get one.

183
00:11:07,821 --> 00:11:09,708
Rym: I was subtitled VHS tape.

184
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:19,999
Scott: I was attention with two episodes Whose video went to the local comic shop and they had the tiny shelf that had like 20 VHS tapes on it.

185
00:11:19,999 --> 00:11:23,033
Scott: 18 of them were on my half and two of them were tension.

186
00:11:23,053 --> 00:11:25,448
Scott: We know no no No, there was also.

187
00:11:25,548 --> 00:11:26,899
Scott: three of them were Dragon Ball Z.

188
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,159
Rym: Now if you were a little little more connected you go to Suncoast video and they had slayers.

189
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,625
Scott: We didn't have one of those they had.

190
00:11:32,646 --> 00:11:36,180
Rym: so they had subtitled anime, which you guys might not remember back then.

191
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,213
Rym: Subtitled anime cost an extra ten to fifteen dollars.

192
00:11:40,253 --> 00:11:41,900
Scott: But anyway, those are the three shows tension.

193
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,803
Scott: It was one of them.

194
00:11:42,843 --> 00:11:45,412
Scott: So of course it was big at the time.

195
00:11:45,573 --> 00:11:47,560
Scott: In fact, you know how it's pretty much disappeared.

196
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,829
Scott: Can you even remember seeing a tenchi cosplayer at any convention recently?

197
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:51,570
Scott: Oh my god.

198
00:11:51,651 --> 00:11:53,656
Rym: No, but yet I remember no to con 2002.

199
00:11:53,656 --> 00:12:01,601
Rym: I Saw a girl who was dressed up as Ryoko and I thought she was super cute and I didn't flirt with her and I don't remember Why.

200
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:04,312
Rym: okay, and back then they were all my age.

201
00:12:04,412 --> 00:12:05,255
Rym: It wasn't like now.

202
00:12:05,355 --> 00:12:06,560
Scott: so continue with your news.

203
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:08,072
Rym: Oh, my news is a geek bite.

204
00:12:08,454 --> 00:12:09,180
Scott: Oh, it's not a news.

205
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:14,320
Rym: You are a no more recent fan of anime and you'd like there's harem shows.

206
00:12:14,621 --> 00:12:17,172
Rym: Actually, I don't think anyone even really remembers love Hina anymore.

207
00:12:17,192 --> 00:12:18,356
Scott: I remember it existed.

208
00:12:18,377 --> 00:12:19,059
Scott: I watched the whole thing.

209
00:12:19,904 --> 00:12:21,332
Rym: I know I didn't cuz I knew better.

210
00:12:21,352 --> 00:12:22,660
Scott: cute turtles is the only good part.

211
00:12:23,082 --> 00:12:25,034
Rym: Yeah, everybody gets one harem show.

212
00:12:25,054 --> 00:12:27,247
Scott: if you're gonna watch it You know why I watch that show.

213
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,459
Scott: because I was home from RIT.

214
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:34,136
Scott: My internet was 56k dial-up modem got everybody already downloaded all of it.

215
00:12:34,176 --> 00:12:39,540
Scott: while I was at RIT I already watched everything that I had already downloaded and I'm sitting at home in the summer sort of in between.

216
00:12:39,701 --> 00:12:43,255
Rym: So when it comes to anime everybody doesn't just get one of a different genre.

217
00:12:43,275 --> 00:12:44,380
Rym: You have a Yahtzee sheet.

218
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:56,360
Rym: You've got like harem show But independently of that you've got the show you watch when you don't have internet Which I guess can't happen anymore and all you've got is something on a hard drive.

219
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:57,765
Rym: That's right.

220
00:12:57,785 --> 00:13:00,074
Rym: My show like that was read or die TV.

221
00:13:00,435 --> 00:13:03,006
Rym: I watched all of read or die TV Living in the woods.

222
00:13:03,127 --> 00:13:04,071
Rym: I didn't have internet.

223
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:05,076
Rym: I was living on the mountain.

224
00:13:05,096 --> 00:13:05,980
Scott: So you did read or die TV.

225
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:06,859
Scott: I did love Hina TV.

226
00:13:07,341 --> 00:13:11,695
Rym: So love Hina fills for you either your harem show or your.

227
00:13:11,755 --> 00:13:13,420
Rym: there is nothing else to do show.

228
00:13:14,306 --> 00:13:18,188
Scott: I think I've seen some other harem shows So I'll put that is our thing else to do.

229
00:13:18,309 --> 00:13:19,152
Rym: so his art.

230
00:13:19,172 --> 00:13:20,940
Scott: does that count as a harem show?

231
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,970
Rym: All right, but it's also a robot show kind of.

232
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,134
Scott: well, how about Maha to kaita?

233
00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:25,957
Scott: Is that a harem show?

234
00:13:26,359 --> 00:13:32,540
Rym: No That is a. that is a wacky anime 90s comedy in my opinion.

235
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:43,336
Rym: Anyway, so if you're gonna watch a harem show You should watch tenchi muyo, but it's hard to watch tenchi muyo because there's no AV.

236
00:13:43,637 --> 00:13:44,740
Rym: That's actually really good.

237
00:13:45,221 --> 00:13:46,425
Rym: There's another OAV.

238
00:13:46,465 --> 00:13:48,150
Rym: That's a sequel to that not as good.

239
00:13:48,451 --> 00:13:49,755
Rym: There's another OAV.

240
00:13:49,815 --> 00:13:50,617
Rym: That's garbage.

241
00:13:50,858 --> 00:13:51,560
Rym: There's a TV show.

242
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,605
Rym: That's garbage a TV show.

243
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,751
Rym: There's more garbage TV show.

244
00:13:53,771 --> 00:13:55,440
Rym: That's even more garbage a TV show.

245
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,598
Rym: You shouldn't watch and then tension.

246
00:13:57,638 --> 00:13:59,285
Scott: wait So they use this.

247
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:03,160
Scott: that there were four TV series is each one was more garbage than the last.

248
00:14:03,681 --> 00:14:07,612
Rym: Everyone is worse, but so hey, but only the fourth one.

249
00:14:07,652 --> 00:14:08,394
Scott: you shouldn't watch.

250
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,580
Scott: so you should watch the first three garbage ones.

251
00:14:11,962 --> 00:14:17,039
Rym: It's kind of like how if you like initial D, okay watch season one You're done.

252
00:14:17,622 --> 00:14:20,331
Rym: If you're a goddamn maniac you watch the rest of it.

253
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:23,964
Rym: if you watch the tension if you get into tension You're gonna watch it all.

254
00:14:24,506 --> 00:14:27,820
Rym: I'm gonna give you all some advice stop before tenchi in Tokyo.

255
00:14:27,921 --> 00:14:28,867
Rym: You might think the Rym.

256
00:14:29,109 --> 00:14:29,793
Rym: I really like it.

257
00:14:29,894 --> 00:14:36,900
Rym: should know no Do not watch tenchi in Tokyo if you like, but they like those three which were garbage.

258
00:14:38,547 --> 00:14:41,123
Scott: They like garbage shouldn't they like?

259
00:14:41,204 --> 00:14:52,120
Rym: in my opinion that tenchi consists of the first movie and the first OAV and everything else is Literally just trying to reclaim nostalgia for those first two things.

260
00:14:53,083 --> 00:15:06,399
Rym: So if you haven't seen a harem show haven't seen these kind of 90s II anime And you don't know where to start you want to know something about tenchi which which was Somewhat moderately important during a time period in American anime history.

261
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:11,367
Rym: in fact I would say that this is one of those anime You should see if you call yourself an anime fan.

262
00:15:11,427 --> 00:15:15,880
Rym: You should watch the tenchi muyo movie tenchi in love.

263
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:20,660
Rym: It is the first movie just 90 minutes long well animated big budget.

264
00:15:21,163 --> 00:15:22,268
Rym: It's a good movie.

265
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:27,220
Rym: there aren't that many anime movies Especially ones that break the formula.

266
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:32,636
Rym: This is a movie for a show that has its own continuity affects the plot kills people.

267
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:33,700
Rym: It's good.

268
00:15:34,803 --> 00:15:37,020
Rym: So watch that that is my geek bite.

269
00:15:37,141 --> 00:15:38,266
Rym: I don't want to say anything else.

270
00:15:38,507 --> 00:15:48,200
Rym: you don't need to know anything about tenchi because I Watched the tenchi movie on the sci-fi channel and all I could think was why the hell can that one girl fly?

271
00:15:48,761 --> 00:15:49,844
Rym: Does she have a tail?

272
00:15:49,864 --> 00:15:52,691
Rym: and I couldn't quite tell if she had a tail or not.

273
00:15:52,731 --> 00:15:54,094
Rym: I was really fascinated by this.

274
00:15:54,115 --> 00:15:59,764
Scott: I Don't need to say anything to that Time.

275
00:15:59,804 --> 00:16:10,650
Rym: you understand 1992 or 93 but anyway things of the day.

276
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,510
Rym: What do you got for me Scott?

277
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:16,330
Scott: I went through my youtube likes and I found the first thing that I thought would be okay.

278
00:16:16,752 --> 00:16:18,543
Scott: And it's been a little dry recently.

279
00:16:18,563 --> 00:16:19,548
Scott: so here we go.

280
00:16:20,292 --> 00:16:23,145
Scott: Girl football player is fast and fun to watch.

281
00:16:23,326 --> 00:16:24,110
Scott: it is some girl.

282
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:40,090
Scott: she looks like she's in elementary middle school age, maybe late elementary early middle and she plays peewee football in whatever her town is and She totally kicks ass and gets like 35 fucking touchdowns and the video is like all fast forwarded.

283
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,798
Scott: So it looks like everyone's running really fast.

284
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:48,087
Scott: They're obviously running slower than that, but She's fast anyway because no one can fucking catch her right.

285
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:52,090
Scott: she gets the ball She runs all the way down the field like a pro, and it's pretty awesome.

286
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,583
Scott: You know I mean I've never seen peewee football.

287
00:16:55,644 --> 00:16:58,476
Scott: anyone this good At peewee football.

288
00:16:58,556 --> 00:17:06,109
Scott: usually peewee football is like a bunch of kids Move a ball and then fall on each other in a big heap and then someone like you know peels them off each other.

289
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,214
Scott: and It's just like there.

290
00:17:07,275 --> 00:17:17,808
Scott: it might as well be vibrating table football right whereas You know this because this girl is in play and she seems to actually know what the fuck is going on and B She's able to run really fast.

291
00:17:18,892 --> 00:17:22,430
Scott: It actually turns into something resembling real football, and it's cool.

292
00:17:23,193 --> 00:17:28,010
Rym: So we talked about we didn't go to the New York comic-con because there's basically nothing to see there.

293
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:33,664
Scott: Anymore no no reason to physically go especially to spend money and time to go there.

294
00:17:33,704 --> 00:17:44,077
Rym: the last thing that most people have you know If you discount all the things that aren't there anymore it comes like this the one thing you can go there for is to see Stuff that no one else has seen before.

295
00:17:44,358 --> 00:17:52,630
Rym: that's being announced and is brand new like if you're waiting for a new show to come Out you'll see like the highlights review preview.

296
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:57,170
Scott: Yeah, they do this at San Diego comic-con and also at New York comic-con like oh my god.

297
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,850
Rym: Here's six minutes of the new My Little Pony episode.

298
00:18:00,795 --> 00:18:01,942
Scott: Pretty much the only two places.

299
00:18:01,982 --> 00:18:03,350
Scott: They do it is they'll be like all right.

300
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,769
Scott: We've got a new movie coming out.

Rym: Someone on YouTube?

305
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:20,987
Scott: someone had a fan cam and put it on YouTube.

306
00:18:21,288 --> 00:18:26,450
Rym: so I'm a fan of venture brothers, and I become more and more of a fan as time has gone on.

307
00:18:27,431 --> 00:18:28,316
Rym: It's a great show.

308
00:18:28,477 --> 00:18:33,849
Rym: It's actually one of my favorite cartoon TV shows There's been in recent memory if you were a fan of it.

309
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:37,110
Rym: You're waiting for season 5. not only is it coming which we've known for a while.

310
00:18:37,751 --> 00:18:44,890
Rym: There is a sizzle reel from New York comic-con 2012 five minutes and 17 seconds of spoilers.

311
00:18:45,653 --> 00:18:52,607
Scott: Something I've learned from sizzle reels is that when you see them You don't need to see the show because it's pretty much all the good parts right and it comes.

312
00:18:52,627 --> 00:18:55,900
Rym: ah But a properly done sizzle reel and this one does it well.

313
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:58,570
Rym: if you watch this and you've never seen venture brothers.

314
00:18:59,277 --> 00:19:00,570
Rym: It makes no goddamn sense.

315
00:19:01,092 --> 00:19:13,764
Rym: Pay attention to certain things happen and people react to them very differently like a dude Shows up in a butterfly costume and people are like yeah, and then some other dude shows up in a similar costume And the crowds like oh my god.

316
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,861
Rym: But this one does a very good job of.

317
00:19:17,941 --> 00:19:24,283
Rym: if you've seen venture brothers It's just everything you see is a really oh my god.

318
00:19:24,323 --> 00:19:25,526
Rym: I got to know what that's all about.

319
00:19:25,586 --> 00:19:26,429
Rym: moment mm-hmm.

320
00:19:27,011 --> 00:19:30,265
Scott: Yeah, usually what happens is it's like the guys who make trailers.

321
00:19:30,305 --> 00:19:31,430
Scott: They're always torn right.

322
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,890
Scott: It's like they don't want to put give everything away in the trailer.

323
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:39,894
Scott: They know that but the problem is okay, so we won't put the best good stuff in the trailer We'll put the medium stuff.

324
00:19:39,914 --> 00:19:44,550
Scott: so now the trailer isn't so good because you want like especially if it's a comedy, right?

325
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,618
Scott: It's like what do you want me to do?

326
00:19:45,658 --> 00:19:47,290
Scott: put the unfunny jokes in the trailer?

327
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:50,710
Scott: No, you get about the funny jokes in there so that people think the movies gonna be funny.

328
00:19:51,072 --> 00:19:58,415
Scott: And then of course they see the trailer they hear all the funny jokes They watch the movie and the only times they laugh are the same jokes that were in the trailer They've already heard.

329
00:19:58,435 --> 00:19:59,381
Scott: and then the movies.

330
00:19:59,421 --> 00:20:00,770
Scott: not funny because those are the only funny.

331
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:07,934
Rym: So the proper way to do a sizzle reel is to show things that are tantalizing Especially in this case.

332
00:20:07,954 --> 00:20:10,221
Rym: you know it's a show that already had four seasons.

333
00:20:10,482 --> 00:20:13,752
Rym: the only people watching this sizzle reel are people who have seen them.

334
00:20:14,334 --> 00:20:18,569
Rym: show them just enough stuff to hint at the kinds of things that will happen.

335
00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:24,170
Rym: and The crazy plot points like oh my god so and so is still alive and some bullshit's gonna happen.

336
00:20:24,452 --> 00:20:26,768
Rym: or why is that guy a centaur now?

337
00:20:26,788 --> 00:20:31,885
Rym: and And Don't actually give enough context to figure out what actually happened?

338
00:20:31,925 --> 00:20:34,153
Rym: don't show an entire scene Mmm-hmm.

339
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:36,685
Rym: so just show the basically fanboy fodder.

340
00:20:36,705 --> 00:20:38,693
Scott: all right That's things of the day.

341
00:20:38,733 --> 00:20:39,576
Scott: meta moment time.

342
00:20:39,616 --> 00:20:44,190
Rym: the book club book is the name of the wind by Patrick Roth.

343
00:20:46,316 --> 00:20:47,586
Rym: You know what pretty good book?

344
00:20:47,606 --> 00:20:48,938
Rym: uh Read it.

345
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:49,590
Scott: It's a book club.

346
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,413
Rym: I'm gonna lock.

347
00:20:50,433 --> 00:20:56,143
Rym: glamour is better, but you should read it because I read it and I started reading the second book Which is the already yeah?

348
00:20:58,012 --> 00:20:58,797
Rym: But I haven't started reading.

349
00:20:58,817 --> 00:21:00,244
Rym: I was on the subway for like an hour.

350
00:21:00,264 --> 00:21:01,048
Rym: I had to do something.

351
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:02,674
Rym: okay I already listen to Dave and Joel.

352
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:04,601
Scott: what other meta moments.

353
00:21:04,621 --> 00:21:05,143
Scott: Do we have?

354
00:21:05,203 --> 00:21:05,805
Scott: you should.

355
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:07,190
Rym: we're gonna be at magfest.

356
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:10,020
Rym: It's coming up in a few months actually right after New Year's January.

357
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,590
Rym: We're going to be doing beyond the Candyland.

358
00:21:13,454 --> 00:21:15,325
Rym: I guess reborn this isn't necessary.

359
00:21:15,365 --> 00:21:20,430
Rym: It's so far away And we're gonna be on probably two gaming intellectuals panels that I cannot announce yet.

360
00:21:20,591 --> 00:21:27,465
Scott: All you need to know is that if you don't go to magfest and you're anywhere even remotely Geographically close to magfest and you're listening to this podcast right now.

361
00:21:27,967 --> 00:21:31,103
Scott: What the fuck is wrong with you I'm a warming up my raw.

362
00:21:31,364 --> 00:21:32,370
Scott: Yeah, seriously, okay?

00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:59,010
Scott: Whatever the thing it is that you use in the internet iTunes RSS You should connect to us in the way of your choosing.

371
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:04,310
Rym: You should also follow me at Shazar on Twitter for reasons that you can find out by asking other GeekNights listeners.

372
00:22:05,551 --> 00:22:08,300
Rym: Okay, I will win that That thing.

374
00:22:18,133 --> 00:22:18,597
Scott: Let's do this.

375
00:22:18,638 --> 00:22:21,298
Scott: show about Area 88 the blue skies.

376
00:22:24,154 --> 00:22:24,737
Rym: You stopped.

377
00:22:25,401 --> 00:22:26,990
Scott: that's all we needed up the trail.

378
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:31,650
Scott: So did you know that there's a Super Nintendo game based on this called UN squadron?

379
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:34,760
Rym: Actually, I heard there's a Super Nintendo game based on this called UN squad.

380
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,449
Scott: really did you know the Super Nintendo game based on this?

381
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,260
Scott: Anime and manga called UN squadron.

382
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,570
Rym: So more importantly there's this movie called snatch.

383
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:45,730
Rym: I don't know if you've ever seen it, but it's an inside joke.

384
00:22:46,292 --> 00:22:49,016
Rym: Oh So here's some context.

385
00:22:49,699 --> 00:22:54,421
Scott: back in the day, you know back in the day Monday We needed to figure out what to do a show on.

386
00:22:54,482 --> 00:22:55,507
Scott: we couldn't come up with anything.

387
00:22:55,527 --> 00:22:57,810
Scott: today We're like we need to watch an anime real quick.

388
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:01,185
Scott: The only DVD we had that had an anime that was only an hour long.

389
00:23:01,226 --> 00:23:02,210
Scott: is it this way two hours?

390
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:05,830
Scott: I was was area 88 so we watched it and now we're doing a show on it.

391
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:08,628
Rym: I want to do a little more context cuz I have seen this before whoa.

392
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:19,695
Rym: So when I knew of it before when I was eight and a half years old And my little brother was Six years old.

393
00:23:19,715 --> 00:23:26,675
Rym: Okay, my parents forced me and my little brother to watch vampire hunter D Eyeball it mouth.

394
00:23:26,735 --> 00:23:29,447
Rym: I was born in 1982 so you can figure out when that was so.

395
00:23:30,953 --> 00:23:53,870
Rym: Not too long after that as in about five minutes after that I was a hardcore anime fan and I went to blockbuster video which existed back then wasn't full of ghosts And I proceeded to rent every single anime that was on the shelf there Except for neon Genesis Evangelion because as a little kid, I thought it was some Christian anime.

396
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,294
Rym: I didn't want to see anything like that.

397
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:56,598
Rym: Good job an atheist.

398
00:23:56,658 --> 00:23:57,320
Scott: Good job.

399
00:23:57,501 --> 00:23:58,363
Rym: Only I'd known.

400
00:23:58,504 --> 00:23:59,005
Scott: good job.

401
00:23:59,065 --> 00:23:59,988
Rym: I swear to God.

402
00:24:00,008 --> 00:24:00,269
Scott: good job.

403
00:24:01,852 --> 00:24:10,515
Scott: So when I went to the RIT anime club I looked at the VHS tapes they had there and even jelly was the one that had the nicest boxes and had a name and Felt like it was.

404
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:12,284
Scott: I just saw these crosses.

405
00:24:12,344 --> 00:24:13,370
Rym: It was called Evangelion.

406
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:18,710
Rym: That was the first one I went for of a wimpy kid like sitting in a chair crying and someone's talking to him.

407
00:24:19,151 --> 00:24:20,476
Rym: I knew what that was gonna be about.

408
00:24:20,496 --> 00:24:21,339
Scott: sure you did.

409
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:37,544
Rym: So after I'd already watched like Armageddon and I don't know wind of amnesia and we named me not even demon demon city There project a co all that business wicked sitting.

410
00:24:38,066 --> 00:24:39,089
Rym: I hadn't seen wicked city.

411
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:48,049
Rym: yet I saw a wicked city later, but still probably Dragon pink and dragon half.

412
00:24:48,834 --> 00:24:55,244
Rym: some point in that sojourn I rented a VHS tape that simply said area 88 the blue skies of betrayal.

413
00:24:55,585 --> 00:24:58,359
Rym: and when I looked at that box I remember thinking wait a minute.

414
00:24:58,922 --> 00:25:00,550
Rym: That looks a lot like UN squadron.

415
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,922
Rym: This is UN squadron, why the fuck is this called area?

416
00:25:06,003 --> 00:25:07,850
Scott: I don't know if we can emphasize enough.

417
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,678
Scott: This thing is fucking UN squadron.

418
00:25:09,719 --> 00:25:12,210
Rym: Yeah, I was a big fan of UN squadron.

419
00:25:12,492 --> 00:25:14,584
Scott: It's actually a fucking good game, but fuck it.

420
00:25:14,645 --> 00:25:18,120
Rym: It's a really good shmup But it's hard as ball like the weather outside.

421
00:25:18,201 --> 00:25:19,907
Rym: I get like the wind rimer that it is.

422
00:25:19,968 --> 00:25:20,510
Scott: That's right.

423
00:25:20,911 --> 00:25:22,015
Scott: So as it fucks.

424
00:25:22,496 --> 00:25:34,789
Rym: I watched this this one episode and I was obsessed with it Because it does all the things that initial D does except it's not like initial D. It's more like one of those more like I don't know one piece.

425
00:25:35,131 --> 00:25:38,730
Scott: Yeah bleach if I was still high school middle school kid, this would have been the best anime.

426
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:43,043
Rym: I'm against initial D of fighter jets sort of but you've got to earn money.

427
00:25:43,103 --> 00:25:48,456
Rym: The dude has to earn money just like Million, I guess dollars.

428
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:49,800
Rym: Maybe it was yen.

429
00:25:50,261 --> 00:25:52,146
Scott: It was something 1.5

430
00:25:52,146 --> 00:26:07,662
Rym: million something's by piloting fighter jets and being paid to shoot down other fighter jets in what apparently is an endless war with unlimited fighter jets in a place that is vaguely Arabic but not in Africa

431
00:26:07,964 --> 00:26:10,415
Scott: with a war that has no Context a war

432
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:14,270
Rym: where there's just bunch of tanks in the desert a bunch of fighter jets destroy them.

433
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,158
Rym: They get paid like 500 bucks a tank.

434
00:26:16,419 --> 00:26:22,141
Scott: Yep, and there's just like in the video game You shoot things and money pops out just like in Raiden.

435
00:26:22,241 --> 00:26:23,967
Scott: or you know any of those shmups?

436
00:26:24,147 --> 00:26:28,170
Rym: and I was a little kid I thought this was the best thing ever and it didn't go anywhere.

437
00:26:29,011 --> 00:26:31,523
Scott: Well, here's the thing is this is only episode fucking one.

438
00:26:31,643 --> 00:26:33,070
Scott: there's three episodes in this OAV.

439
00:26:33,311 --> 00:26:34,536
Scott: We've only seen the first time.

440
00:26:34,696 --> 00:26:35,741
Rym: there is another area.

441
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:38,090
Rym: eight is a terrible recent TV show.

442
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,483
Scott: Okay, so according to Wikipedia is a long ass manga.

443
00:26:40,523 --> 00:26:41,850
Scott: this 20-something volume never read.

444
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,110
Scott: It is a three episode OAV of which we are only discussing episode one.

445
00:26:45,411 --> 00:26:52,396
Rym: I've only seen one episode if I saw more episodes and their tiny brain does not remember and there is a TV series that is Actually relatively more recent.

446
00:26:52,557 --> 00:26:55,650
Rym: I watched one episode of it and it was I watched it.

447
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:59,450
Rym: All I could think was this feels way bad compared to the original OAV.

448
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,197
Scott: So here's something interesting and the reason.

449
00:27:01,237 --> 00:27:03,205
Scott: we only saw the first episodes OAV.

450
00:27:03,426 --> 00:27:04,510
Rym: Yeah, we had a DVD of it.

451
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:05,092
Scott: We have okay.

452
00:27:05,132 --> 00:27:07,321
Scott: So first CPM put it out on VHS.

453
00:27:07,341 --> 00:27:08,726
Scott: the whole fucking thing, right.

454
00:27:09,368 --> 00:27:17,230
Scott: then CPM put out only the very first episode on DVD, which is what we have.

455
00:27:17,992 --> 00:27:23,969

Rym: So it will get there.

494
00:29:05,488 --> 00:29:05,868
Scott: That's true.

495
00:29:06,269 --> 00:29:10,110
Scott: All right, so Let's talk about this actual fucking show.

496
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,759
Scott: So the first episode here you and squadron, here's the deal.

497
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:13,782
Scott: There's a guy.

498
00:29:13,822 --> 00:29:14,906
Scott: he's a badass fighter.

499
00:29:14,966 --> 00:29:16,150
Scott: Shin Kazuma.

500
00:29:16,951 --> 00:29:20,361
Scott: He's piloting this meaningless fighter pilot in this meaningless war in the desert.

501
00:29:20,381 --> 00:29:23,694
Rym: He's pretty he's got side hair and he bears his chest On the cover.

502
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:29,020
Scott: He's at area 88 which is this Airport, basically with all the fighter jets take off.

503
00:29:29,683 --> 00:29:31,630
Rym: There's a gas station in initial D.

504
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:35,442
Scott: Yeah, there are other characters there who are also fighter pilots of various sorts.

505
00:29:35,623 --> 00:29:37,830
Rym: the bearded guy who's like my planes on fire.

506
00:29:37,971 --> 00:29:38,233
Rym: Fuck it.

507
00:29:38,253 --> 00:29:38,918
Rym: Let's keep going.

508
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:40,690
Scott: Most of those other characters don't really matter.

509
00:29:40,931 --> 00:29:46,270
Scott: There's a photographer who's sort of you know, they're witnessing what's going on, but he doesn't really matter either isn't doing anything.

510
00:29:46,371 --> 00:29:47,359
Rym: He's no speedgrapher.

511
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:47,883
Scott: Yeah, nothing.

512
00:29:47,903 --> 00:29:48,770
Scott: He does means anything.

513
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,513
Scott: He's just sort of there.

514
00:29:49,593 --> 00:29:52,946
Rym: as far as I can tell the area 88 TV show focuses mostly on him.

515
00:29:53,388 --> 00:30:06,615
Scott: Oh interesting Yeah, cuz I mean if you did that it would be sort of like a Marvel situation where you have this sort of you know Neutral character sort of giving you the viewpoint of the viewer of the show, you know watching things from the outside Perspective.

516
00:30:06,716 --> 00:30:08,890
Rym: but no this one clearly actually just follows.

517
00:30:09,191 --> 00:30:12,204
Scott: Yeah, all the guy with the camera all he does is bother people.

518
00:30:12,706 --> 00:30:13,630
Scott: There's some other characters.

519
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:18,646
Scott: We barely see them in this first episode except for you know, the impetus of why?

520
00:30:18,706 --> 00:30:21,877
Scott: shin cosmo piloting You know planes in this meaningless war.

521
00:30:21,937 --> 00:30:26,594
Rym: So when I was a kid, I thought that the plot of why he's doing This was amazing.

522
00:30:26,915 --> 00:30:28,099
Rym: It was the best thing ever.

523
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:29,906
Rym: I couldn't oh my god fighter jets.

524
00:30:30,327 --> 00:30:40,989
Rym: So watching it now His friend wants to shtink his girlfriend, yep, so he gets him drunk Yep, and then holds a piece of paper in front of him to sign this.

525
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:42,598
Scott: That's it.

526
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,888
Scott: He signs it That's it.

527
00:30:44,151 --> 00:30:52,939
Scott: That is a con actually a contract to have the guy signed up to go and do the killing fight in the Osron Royal Mercenary Air Force, right?

528
00:30:53,301 --> 00:31:07,230
Rym: He has to either fight for three years Be earn 1.5 million dollars or dessert which I assume they kill you if you dessert Yeah, well if they catch you deserting, yeah, and in the desert you're not gonna make it now.

529
00:31:07,372 --> 00:31:13,338
Rym: uh What's interesting is that he signs this contract and then these dudes with guns come and they're like We're gonna shoot you if you don't come.

530
00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:15,770
Rym: I feel like the contract is unnecessary.

531
00:31:16,712 --> 00:31:19,969
Rym: I feel like they could have just kidnapped him and it's kind of stupid.

532
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:27,599
Rym: up bonus points the guy who shanghaied him Basically did it to marry the daughter and the daughter.

533
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:31,494
Rym: the daughter of this rich guy and the daughter who loves shin is like I'm not gonna marry you.

534
00:31:31,574 --> 00:31:33,722
Rym: I still love shin cuz she's actually kind of cool dude.

535
00:31:33,742 --> 00:31:35,750
Scott: You could marry fucking any girl.

536
00:31:35,891 --> 00:31:40,530
Scott: Why do you need to shanghaied dude to marry that girl also in the preview of the next episode?

537
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:45,029
Rym: He's like she won't marry me because she thinks shins still alive, but doesn't know.

538
00:31:45,691 --> 00:31:51,211
Rym: So he tries to hire a hitman to kill shin while he's still in area 88.

539
00:31:51,211 --> 00:31:53,282
Scott: Why don't you just falsify some evidence that he's dead?

540
00:31:53,463 --> 00:31:57,400
Rym: Yeah, or just say How does she even know he's alive?

541
00:31:57,602 --> 00:31:59,030
Rym: How is killing him going to matter?

542
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:01,317
Rym: Why didn't you just kill him in the first place?

543
00:32:01,337 --> 00:32:03,404
Scott: None of this shit makes fucking any sense at all.

544
00:32:03,665 --> 00:32:05,010
Scott: It's so contrived.

545
00:32:05,251 --> 00:32:06,841
Rym: Maybe the manga tells you more.

546
00:32:07,002 --> 00:32:08,149
Rym: Yeah, there's something I want to say.

547
00:32:08,752 --> 00:32:20,676
Rym: We when we talked about the baron omatsuri the sixth one-piece movie We were inspired to do a lecture which we're gonna do an anime Boston about how every anime Is the same?

548
00:32:20,998 --> 00:32:26,019
Scott: Well, no every anime movie is the same but These are not the same only these movies.

549
00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:28,846
Rym: Well, the slayers motion picture is arguably an OAV.

550
00:32:29,227 --> 00:32:30,170
Scott: Was it never in theaters?

551
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:35,352
Rym: Oh, so if you watch the slayers OAVs, they actually have the same anyway, that's true Those are so.

552
00:32:35,813 --> 00:32:38,801
Rym: there are two classes of those standalone anime things.

553
00:32:39,002 --> 00:32:41,990
Rym: That's one is the baron omatsuri that we're gonna talk about a lot.

554
00:32:42,351 --> 00:32:48,350
Rym: The other is area 88, but the best example of this is the god-awful sanctuary OAV.

555
00:32:49,090 --> 00:33:04,879
Rym: There was an era where there were a ton of OAVs and all they are is let's get all the proper nouns from some really popular manga and Show just enough of it to where everyone who has read that manga is gonna buy this VHS tape or DVD and watch it and go.

556
00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:05,641
Rym: Oh my god.

557
00:33:05,962 --> 00:33:06,764
Rym: There's the character.

558
00:33:06,804 --> 00:33:07,707
Rym: I like from the manga.

559
00:33:07,727 --> 00:33:12,726
Rym: Oh my god There's some foreshadowing for something that will never happen in this OAV exactly.

560
00:33:12,767 --> 00:33:13,590
Scott: Well think about it, right?

561
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:17,330
Scott: It's like, you know nowadays you get an anime series like say Death Note, right?

562
00:33:17,631 --> 00:33:23,150
Scott: Take the whole manga copy the whole damn thing translate the whole show to anime right and put it out on TV.

563
00:33:23,552 --> 00:33:24,399
Scott: That's what they did there.

564
00:33:24,439 --> 00:33:25,990
Scott: this it's back in the day.

565
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:27,903
Scott: They had a lot more money in the anime industry.

566
00:33:27,924 --> 00:33:36,240
Scott: and it's like well Here's this somewhat more obscure not as popular as Dragon Ball Z thing, you know Which is gonna get you know, completely translated into an anime.

567
00:33:36,862 --> 00:33:44,449
Scott: We don't want to make a whole TV series for area 88 so let's sort of squish it down and make an OAV and super fans will buy it and pay a lot of money for it.

568
00:33:44,469 --> 00:33:48,850
Scott: and You know, we only had to produce like three episodes.

569
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:54,347
Scott: Let's just you know copy as much of the plot as we can and squish it in here like the sanctuary.

570
00:33:54,447 --> 00:33:55,290
Scott: one was like episode.

571
00:33:55,411 --> 00:34:00,712
Scott: it's basically volumes one and two of sanctuary animated poorly and That's it.

572
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:06,762
Scott: and they just don't bother continue with the rest of the manga and it's pretty much like hey super fans We animated some of your obscure thing.

573
00:34:06,802 --> 00:34:07,405
Scott: Isn't that cool?

574
00:34:07,707 --> 00:34:11,696
Scott: Yeah So, I mean granted we've only seen OAV one.

575
00:34:11,775 --> 00:34:20,858
Scott: but I mean you're not gonna convince me that if I watch episodes two and three of the OAV that that is going to contain everything that happened in 25 volumes of manga.

576
00:34:20,938 --> 00:34:23,730
Rym: this OAV is notable one because of UN squadron.

577
00:34:24,212 --> 00:34:28,489
Rym: Yes, the video game - it has some pretty dangerous music.

578
00:34:30,518 --> 00:34:32,178
Rym: Good God three.

579
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:38,989
Rym: the characters Have these this ridiculous Foley like when he takes off his helmet.

580
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,168
Rym: There's like this shook noise.

581
00:34:41,231 --> 00:34:48,090
Rym: It's almost as ridiculous as an escaflowne when every sword apparently it consists of nothing but a million raddly pieces of metal.

582
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:55,284
Rym: Everything they do has these like ridiculous noises to the point that I couldn't stop laughing the entire time.

583
00:34:55,606 --> 00:34:59,829
Scott: and how many people can crash land fighter jets on the runway without getting hurt at all?

584
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:03,560
Rym: This is basically someone crash lands a fighter jet behind you the movie.

585
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:07,290
Scott: Nothing is realistic or making sense or they're not even trying.

586
00:35:07,491 --> 00:35:10,604
Rym: So this was directed by a man named Hisayuki Toriyomi.

587
00:35:10,624 --> 00:35:11,487
Scott: Okay, never heard of him.

588
00:35:11,507 --> 00:35:12,110
Rym: I'd never heard of him.

589
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:14,723
Rym: So I did a little bit of research meaning I looked at anime news network.

590
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:21,386
Rym: Okay, and The only thing he is directed that I have ever even heard of.

591
00:35:21,446 --> 00:35:24,654
Scott: besides area 88 is Fucking Lily cat.

592
00:35:24,694 --> 00:35:25,436
Scott: I never heard of Lily.

593
00:35:25,536 --> 00:35:25,957
Scott: Really?

594
00:35:26,018 --> 00:35:27,121
Rym: You've never seen Lily cat.

595
00:35:27,161 --> 00:35:27,883
Scott: What is it like it?

596
00:35:28,705 --> 00:35:31,397
Rym: It's a terrible anime No kidding.

597
00:35:31,961 --> 00:35:32,948
Scott: What's what's it about?

598
00:35:32,968 --> 00:35:34,732
Rym: a Genetic?

599
00:35:35,173 --> 00:35:36,077
Rym: I don't even know, okay.

600
00:35:36,459 --> 00:35:40,867
Rym: Oh Wait, here's a plot summary.

601
00:35:41,654 --> 00:35:45,063
Rym: Okay So this plot summary doesn't jive with anything.

602
00:35:45,103 --> 00:35:46,688
Rym: I remember other than that There's a gene.

603
00:35:47,164 --> 00:35:53,189
Rym: Okay So a crew travels across the universe in a ship that can travel for 20 years with the crew that will only age one year.

604
00:35:54,033 --> 00:35:58,230
Rym: Suddenly some of the crew members come down with some sort of virus with no help from the outside world.

605
00:35:58,692 --> 00:36:00,439
Rym: They survive the viral attack for a year.

606
00:36:00,459 --> 00:36:05,540
Rym: Okay, basically an alien knock-off Or an alien knock-off with the cat girl at it.

607
00:36:05,821 --> 00:36:06,705
Rym: There's no cat girl.

608
