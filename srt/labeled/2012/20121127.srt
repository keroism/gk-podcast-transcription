1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,917
Rym: It's Tuesday, November 27th, 2012.

2
00:00:12,917 --> 00:00:13,348
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,834 --> 00:00:14,308
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,531 --> 00:00:15,810
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,669
Rym: Tonight, the board game seasons.

6
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:18,870
Rym: It's alright.

7
00:00:20,853 --> 00:00:21,549
Scott: Just give it away, what?

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:22,684
Rym: Spoilers.

9
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:25,008
Scott: Let's do this.

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,810
Rym: So this past weekend, our friends Phil and Chie came out and we had a sort of post-Thanksgiving feast.

11
00:00:34,175 --> 00:00:35,369
Rym: I feel like a big boy now.

12
00:00:35,651 --> 00:00:42,810
Rym: There's a point in your life when you're able to cook a full Thanksgiving family-style dinner and not feel like you're just faking it.

13
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,709
Rym: I feel like I'm actually an old man now.

14
00:00:45,653 --> 00:00:46,046
Scott: Way to go.

15
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,309
Rym: Yeah, I'm proud of myself.

16
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,621
Scott: Add it to your list of things that make you an old man.

17
00:00:49,661 --> 00:00:51,528
Scott: that started, I don't know, ten years ago.

18
00:00:51,874 --> 00:00:52,065
Rym: Let's see.

19
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,549
Rym: Has played Counter-Strike for more than a decade?

20
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:55,021
Rym: Check.

21
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,320
Scott: Everyone should go to the forum and check that picture.

22
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:05,470
Scott: I put up where it shows on Wikipedia the date Steam came out and then shows right under it a picture from my Steam profile.

23
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,470
Scott: What's funny is the date of my Steam account creation was the date Steam came out.

24
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:20,650
Rym: Responding to you clearly have no sense of when games come out and what was important because Steam, when it came out, existed solely to download Counter-Strike patches.

25
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:30,039
Scott: And also because Juan had died, you needed to find servers to play on using Steam, which was a much improved UI over.

26
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,170
Scott: the problem was Steam itself at the time did not work for many people.

27
00:01:34,673 --> 00:01:35,928
Rym: Remember when Steam...

28
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:36,949
Scott: It never not worked for me.

29
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,690
Rym: For the longest time, the friends stuff just didn't fucking work.

30
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,161
Scott: Well, they had the friends stuff in there as like.

31
00:01:43,502 --> 00:01:46,489
Scott: they put the GUI and framework in there before they had the network up.

32
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:47,630
Rym: But it just didn't do anything.

33
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,590
Scott: And it's like, it's like, why did you put this in here if it's not working yet?

34
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,369
Scott: And then when they even had it working, it's like they didn't, the friends servers weren't always running.

35
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:56,990
Scott: So they'd be like on and off and on and off.

36
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,329
Scott: So basically you just ignored that shit.

37
00:01:58,793 --> 00:01:59,869
Scott: Now it pretty much works.

38
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:00,450
Scott: Yeah.

39
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,349
Scott: But yeah, it really did.

40
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:10,568
Scott: All it was when Steam originally came out was automatically get Counter-Strike patches without having to go to counter-strike.net and click on every mirror.

41
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:18,390
Scott: And which is why all those mirror sites died and to find Counter-Strike servers.

42
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:22,730
Rym: But so this weekend our friend Chie recommended we go to a tea place.

43
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,709
Rym: We got together and we went out to Flushing to this place called Fang Gourmet Tea.

44
00:02:27,076 --> 00:02:27,567
Scott: I did not go.

45
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:29,130
Rym: Well, of course you didn't.

46
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,789
Rym: Would you want to go have a tea tasting with us?

47
00:02:32,335 --> 00:02:33,010
Scott: No, I don't like tea.

48
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:38,249
Rym: So basically what this was, we had the equivalent of a sommelier, but for tea.

49
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:43,950
Rym: And we did tastings and the sommelier explained like what each tea was.

50
00:02:44,312 --> 00:02:45,049
Scott: When you make tea.

51
00:02:45,455 --> 00:02:45,729
Scott: Right.

52
00:02:46,391 --> 00:02:49,468
Scott: It's like if you have wine, you can take a bottle of wine and pour a little bit.

53
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:50,068
Rym: Yeah.

54
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,230
Rym: So she did this complicated thing.

55
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,370
Scott: And then you can give little bits to people at another table.

56
00:02:54,936 --> 00:02:55,210
Scott: Right.

57
00:02:55,472 --> 00:02:57,930
Scott: And it's like, you know, you're not really wasting it when you make tea.

58
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,089
Scott: It's like there's a minimum amount of tea you make from.

59
00:03:01,053 --> 00:03:03,329
Rym: No, you can make single glasses of tea.

60
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:03,950
Scott: Right.

61
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,190
Scott: But if you're having a tasting, how many glasses of tea are you going to have?

62
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,949
Rym: Five tiny ones that are each one sip per type of tea.

63
00:03:11,431 --> 00:03:11,769
Scott: Really?

64
00:03:11,972 --> 00:03:12,059
Rym: Yeah.

65
00:03:12,451 --> 00:03:13,143
Scott: So how do they mean?

66
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,990
Scott: But you make tea in a teapot.

67
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,510
Scott: They have a whole.

68
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,128
Rym: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

69
00:03:17,652 --> 00:03:19,850
Rym: You make tea in a teapot if you're making tea in bulk.

70
00:03:20,251 --> 00:03:22,690
Rym: OK, so basically what she does is a tea thimble.

71
00:03:23,032 --> 00:03:26,310
Rym: First she'd take out the tea leaves for the particular tea.

72
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:35,750
Rym: We tried a high mountain Taiwanese one leaf, put it in a cup first and then we try to something else, some kind of roasted black tea and then our rapport.

73
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:44,210
Rym: Basically what she do is you take the leaves out and show them to us and explain like where it came from and the characteristics past the leaves around fucks with them.

74
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:48,682
Rym: Then she'd put enough for, you know, one small pot and do a little thing and pour hot water over it.

75
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,390
Rym: Let it steep for a little bit, rinse it out and do all this stuff.

76
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,830
Rym: And then she'd pour each of us a little glass and she'd repeat this five times.

77
00:03:54,950 --> 00:04:01,288
Rym: You could resteep what she had poured out five times and she'd point out how the flavors change with each steeping.

78
00:04:03,781 --> 00:04:04,290
Scott: It gets steeping.

79
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:05,489
Scott: Number six tastes like water.

80
00:04:06,396 --> 00:04:06,827
Rym: Actually no.

81
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:09,428
Rym: Apparently that only happens to shitty tea.

82
00:04:09,932 --> 00:04:11,949
Scott: So but you did it five times.

83
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,259
Scott: So I'm saying the sixth time.

84
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:14,890
Scott: we could have done more.

85
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,430
Rym: She said that she'll steep tea herself seven or eight times.

86
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:18,069
Rym: What was cool.

87
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,769
Scott: So tea number 10 tastes like water.

88
00:04:19,995 --> 00:04:20,269
Scott: Maybe.

89
00:04:20,772 --> 00:04:26,188
Rym: The coolest thing was that she was so much like the girl in drops of God who wants to be a sommelier.

90
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:27,370
Rym: It was ridiculous.

91
00:04:27,711 --> 00:04:32,350
Rym: She like lives alone and she works in this place and she worked here for many years and she does the tea tastings.

92
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:36,190
Rym: And of course she tasted each tea too as she was preparing everything for us.

93
00:04:36,654 --> 00:04:37,490
Rym: She knows her shit.

94
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,889
Rym: Like she knows tea really well.

95
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:44,009
Rym: And then she was telling us about how at home she makes the tea herself and does the same thing.

96
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,890
Rym: Like she owned the place.

97
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,110
Rym: So she does the same thing.

98
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,010
Rym: The drops of God girl does.

99
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:53,168
Rym: She like taste the tea at home and practices and learns that it was, I don't know, it was really fun.

100
00:04:54,195 --> 00:04:56,510
Rym: And as as cool as it was, should have given her drops.

101
00:04:57,232 --> 00:05:02,869
Rym: I am not going to learn much more about this because I have enough on my hands with beer and wine.

102
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:04,610
Scott: I already have too many.

103
00:05:05,073 --> 00:05:06,669
Scott: I already took on too many things.

104
00:05:07,315 --> 00:05:08,309
Scott: You should see the robot.

105
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,650
Rym: One could say that my cup overflowed.

106
00:05:10,955 --> 00:05:11,061
Scott: Yeah.

107
00:05:11,532 --> 00:05:14,209
Scott: I just bought these plastic robots or I bought the RG.

108
00:05:15,095 --> 00:05:17,030
Scott: They actually made membrane Gundam seed.

109
00:05:17,512 --> 00:05:19,909
Scott: There was the air, the jet that the kid would fly.

110
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:20,970
Scott: Oh, yeah.

111
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:21,949
Scott: I forget the kid's name.

112
00:05:22,191 --> 00:05:22,432
Scott: Right.

113
00:05:22,472 --> 00:05:22,794
Scott: And it would.

114
00:05:22,854 --> 00:05:26,430
Scott: it would deploy the different equipment onto the strike Gundam.

115
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,990
Scott: So I said, whoa, they made a model of that thing.

116
00:05:30,092 --> 00:05:30,666
Scott: And it's RG.

117
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,608
Scott: I got to get that, you know, because it's like usually just make robots that they're making the jet.

118
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:36,309
Scott: I've like sold.

119
00:05:36,413 --> 00:05:36,666
Scott: Right.

120
00:05:37,534 --> 00:05:38,529
Scott: And then I'm like, you know what?

121
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:41,929
Scott: I'll buy the strike Gundam also because, you know, that's also RG.

122
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:42,446
Scott: Why not?

123
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:50,370
Scott: Apparently, they go together and the jet actually comes with the equipment to deploy onto the strike Gundam.

124
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:59,710
Scott: So if you buy both, which I now have, you can switch the strike Gundam to have, you know, the big green desert backpack thing or, you know, the sword thing.

125
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,227
Rym: Wow.

126
00:06:00,532 --> 00:06:00,807
Scott: Yeah.

127
00:06:01,334 --> 00:06:01,807
Scott: How about that?

128
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:02,468
Rym: Wow.

129
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,170
Rym: Suddenly I forgot about that entire aspect of Gundam seed.

130
00:06:06,752 --> 00:06:08,710
Rym: Now I kind of just want to watch Gundam see it.

131
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,089
Scott: Well, we're going to steal it back from Scott Johnson very soon.

132
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:21,230
Scott: You want to do a, uh, the utensil analysis of Gundam seed has a lot of recap episodes and it's also got maybe too many episodes.

133
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:25,770
Scott: I think we'd be better off doing some evangelical and after we do a tenant, that would be a good one.

134
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:26,773
Scott: I think that is, we'll see.

135
00:06:26,813 --> 00:06:29,483
Rym: if we do one a week, it'll be 39 or 40 weeks.

136
00:06:31,554 --> 00:06:32,189
Scott: That's plenty.

137
00:06:32,499 --> 00:06:32,666
Scott: Yeah.

138
00:06:33,276 --> 00:06:33,426
Scott: Okay.

139
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:34,769
Scott: Let's move along some news.

140
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:35,270
Scott: All right.

141
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,409
Rym: So we, you came out, we didn't buy one.

142
00:06:39,713 --> 00:06:40,489
Scott: Didn't buy one.

143
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:44,050
Rym: Nintendo's stock, not, uh, not reacting so well.

144
00:06:44,891 --> 00:06:56,208
Rym: Uh, every game stop I've passed in New York city has had plenty of the white one and all but one of them had at least one, if not more of the black ones, I haven't seen anyone actually have the black.

145
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,128
Rym: I was out in flushing.

146
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,010
Rym: There was a pile of both just in the goddamn window.

147
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:06,250
Scott: And uh, see, here's the thing that, you know, I'm going to say it again, right?

148
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:09,990
Scott: I mean, there's always the stuff that we know and have said about Nintendo.

149
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:11,850
Scott: You can listen to old dude.

150
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,570
Rym: Look at that stock chart I linked to.

151
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,230
Rym: It's like Nintendo's stock peak.

152
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,430
Rym: I'm not after the right.

153
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:17,890
Scott: I'm not going to repeat myself.

154
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:18,890
Scott: You've heard this before.

155
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,810
Scott: If you haven't, you can go hear it again.

156
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:29,730
Scott: But I want to say is that those things that we have said in the past are more true now than they were before, right?

157
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:37,070
Scott: We've said things, for example, man, if Nintendo would just open up and let anyone make software on their shit, they would really rock the house.

158
00:07:37,513 --> 00:07:38,450
Scott: That's more true.

159
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:44,049
Scott: Now, if you could write any software you wanted for that pad with that thing, they'll be selling even more.

160
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:48,070
Scott: That's, you know, it's more true for the Wii U than it was for the Wii and the DS, right?

161
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:54,769
Scott: It's you know, if somebody would just make a game like the game we said, like four swords and everyone would buy it.

162
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:55,989
Scott: That's more true now.

163
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:01,477
Scott: So it's just, it's the disappointment, lack of potential is just, that's what's bothering me.

164
00:08:02,776 --> 00:08:05,730
Scott: The gap has just widened, but nothing has changed.

165
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:11,069
Rym: It's such a, for me now, not for the market at large, but for me, it's such a too little, too late thing.

166
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:20,990
Rym: It's like to use the analogy I used on the forum around 2002, you know, in the early GameCube days, it was a brand new link cables, all that stuff.

167
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:29,970
Rym: Nintendo had a party going on and they had plenty of beer, beer being the analogy for games that were innovative and cool and different, the kinds of stuff that is my jam.

168
00:08:30,892 --> 00:08:34,830
Rym: And then the beer ran out, as happens at parties, Nintendo wouldn't buy any more beer.

169
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,398
Rym: So I left and I went back to the PC gaming party.

170
00:08:37,398 --> 00:08:42,467
Scott: 10 years later, you know, it's cheap beer while it's all varieties of beer on the PC.

171
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,230
Scott: The thing is, but it overflows.

172
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:49,970
Rym: The PC beer party had been nothing but Budweiser for a while and suddenly it came back.

173
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:50,850
Rym: We're not always right.

174
00:08:51,010 --> 00:09:01,710
Rym: I mean, well, I think that we were right in the sense that PC gaming was out of beer back when we said it was dead, but a new PC gaming has emerged.

175
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:06,670
Scott: And now that is every microbrew in the universe and also the prices have come crashing down.

176
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:11,250
Scott: So the PC gaming right now is freaking every fancy microbrew for a dollar.

177
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:20,210
Rym: So after Crystal Chronicles, I mean, the beer ran out and 10 years later, give or take, I get an invite to Nintendo's party.

178
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,690
Rym: They're like, hey, we got a couple of cans of beer.

179
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,550
Scott: If you want to come back over, how many can join our party and how much are they?

180
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,689
Scott: It's a three hundred dollar can.

181
00:09:27,871 --> 00:09:28,769
Scott: How much is we even cost?

182
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:36,513
Rym: And basically the games that people are saying are fun on the Wii U right now are basically Pac-Man verse.

183
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:42,050
Scott: at best a game that has existed for a Wii U is four hundred twenty.

184
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:42,775
Scott: I can't be right.

185
00:09:43,118 --> 00:09:44,510
Rym: Is that the deluxe one?

186
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,333
Rym: I guess with the.

187
00:09:45,373 --> 00:09:50,194
Scott: I guess that the Amazon price because it's it's that that does the deluxe one.

188
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:51,288
Scott: Let me go out.

189
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:51,714
Scott: It can't.

190
00:09:51,755 --> 00:09:52,730
Scott: that can't be the real price.

191
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,490
Scott: That has to be like the inflated third party seller price.

192
00:09:55,571 --> 00:09:56,037
Scott: Let me see.

193
00:09:56,057 --> 00:09:56,969
Scott: Find the real price.

194
00:09:57,952 --> 00:10:06,870
Rym: But here's the most damning thing against the Wii U, because I could talk about what I want, but I know that what I want is not what the industry wants or what other gamers want.

195
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:12,693
Rym: For example, I want a game like Mega Team Fortress, even though I know that is a shit game.

196
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:14,629
Scott: The deluxe one is three fifty.

197
00:10:15,231 --> 00:10:17,429
Scott: God, that is way too much money.

198
00:10:17,871 --> 00:10:30,270
Rym: So the most damning thing I can say is that I know three parents, three parents in different contexts of my life who in the past week have told me they're going to go buy their kids a Nintendo Wii.

199
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:34,510
Rym: And upon questioning, I learned that, no, they mean the Nintendo Wii.

200
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,140
Rym: They had no idea.

201
00:10:36,161 --> 00:10:37,169
Rym: a Wii U came out.

202
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:39,309
Rym: They had no intention of purchasing one.

203
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:43,612
Rym: The idea of paying more than one hundred and fifty dollars for a console seemed ridiculous to them.

204
00:10:43,632 --> 00:10:49,073
Rym: And they asked me, what are the hot games on the Wii other than that bowling game?

205
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:51,570
Rym: But that bowling game is the only one they actually wanted to buy.

206
00:10:51,711 --> 00:10:53,388
Rym: This is three people who don't know each other.

207
00:10:54,671 --> 00:10:59,450
Rym: Normal people have no idea, no idea that the Nintendo Wii U came out.

208
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:05,352
Rym: They think of Nintendo as the company that made the Wii, and they don't know it in any other context.

209
00:11:06,154 --> 00:11:16,810
Rym: So Nintendo now couple this with the fact that the regular Wii, the Wii U, the non deluxe edition, that's basically the bullshit edition, not to sell them so well.

210
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:19,170
Rym: And a lot of places have plenty in stock.

211
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,689
Rym: It's the deluxe one that sold out.

212
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:30,930
Rym: So the hardcore Nintendo people who haven't backed away like we have seem to be the primary market now, unless the distribution of which ones are available is just way off.

213
00:11:32,494 --> 00:11:33,990
Rym: I don't know how this is going to go for Nintendo.

214
00:11:36,236 --> 00:11:37,810
Scott: I mean, whatever the system came out.

215
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:39,450
Scott: It's the same news over and over again.

216
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,810
Scott: So I really don't have much to say without just repeating myself and making this part of the podcast incredibly long.

217
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:44,970
Rym: Well, it's not the same news.

218
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,450
Rym: The last time we talked about this was when the 3DS came out.

219
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,910
Scott: I mean, I'm saying it's different consoles, same Nintendo.

220
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,916
Scott: They haven't changed anything since.

221
00:11:52,037 --> 00:11:55,130
Scott: they have turned down the dark path and that's it.

222
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,310
Rym: But they turn back.

223
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,130
Rym: The problem is they turn back so late in the game.

224
00:11:59,311 --> 00:12:00,809
Rym: It would be I'm trying to think of a good analogy.

225
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:01,909
Scott: They haven't turned back at all.

226
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:03,310
Scott: It's the same thing they've been doing for years.

227
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,470
Scott: There were same complaints.

228
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,200
Scott: They're still valid.

229
00:12:05,221 --> 00:12:05,790
Scott: Nothing's changed.

230
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,230
Rym: Now what they do is have a new console with the same complaint.

231
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,250
Rym: They went back to doing something a little innovative.

232
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,670
Rym: The whole asymmetric play, the idea of having.

233
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,129
Scott: But they didn't make any games that did it.

234
00:12:14,412 --> 00:12:15,023
Scott: They did.

235
00:12:15,064 --> 00:12:15,268
Scott: They did.

236
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,155
Scott: They made what game?

237
00:12:16,216 --> 00:12:18,010
Rym: They made three clones of Pac-Man verse.

238
00:12:18,391 --> 00:12:23,190
Rym: OK, so they have made more games that do the same thing, but the console came out.

239
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:27,670
Rym: So now we're in the post release drought, which Nintendo consoles always have.

240
00:12:28,051 --> 00:12:31,230
Rym: So it's going to be a couple of months before anything new comes out.

241
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:37,150
Scott: And I've been to ever fucking launched a console with like an A plus full on Zelda game ever Zelda game.

242
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:38,295
Scott: I mean, come on.

243
00:12:38,355 --> 00:12:40,870
Scott: It's like that's the game that people actually want.

244
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,490
Scott: Always is Smash Brothers.

245
00:12:43,171 --> 00:12:45,710
Scott: Real Zelda only hardcore people want Smash Brothers.

246
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,770
Scott: I'm saying these are the games people want.

247
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,968
Scott: They want Smash Brothers Mario.

248
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,148
Scott: They want hardcore Zelda game, right?

249
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,909
Scott: They want these things and they never launch with that.

250
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,749
Scott: They always bring that out like when the console is like near death.

251
00:12:56,173 --> 00:12:57,790
Rym: Well, because that's to bump the sales.

252
00:12:58,451 --> 00:13:01,170
Scott: Why don't they make fucking like an awesome Pokemon or something?

253
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,207
Scott: People love that shit, too.

254
00:13:03,455 --> 00:13:04,389
Rym: Well, we already know.

255
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,709
Rym: We did a whole lecture at PAX and how they don't utilize.

256
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,390
Scott: Anyway, let's move on to the same Nintendo complete.

257
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,370
Scott: So the big steam sale happened.

258
00:13:11,952 --> 00:13:13,929
Scott: Not really that much to buy so much.

259
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,990
Rym: I bought limbo because it was like a dollar.

260
00:13:16,193 --> 00:13:16,456
Rym: I didn't.

261
00:13:16,538 --> 00:13:17,389
Rym: I don't even like limbo.

262
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,790
Scott: But there were two interesting things happened.

263
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,450
Scott: Number one, there was this game called Hotline Miami.

264
00:13:24,153 --> 00:13:26,026
Scott: I didn't really know anything about this game at all.

265
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,549
Scott: But people started talking about it and it was crazy cheap.

266
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,210
Scott: But I saw some talk that it was mad buggy.

267
00:13:33,872 --> 00:13:39,149
Scott: So I was like, all right, I'm going to take one for the team and buy Hotline Miami and see what the deal is.

268
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,190
Scott: So now I have taken it for the team.

269
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,145
Scott: I'm going to tell you how it is.

270
00:13:43,091 --> 00:13:45,150
Scott: It's actually it's a single player game.

271
00:13:45,211 --> 00:13:47,370
Scott: Mostly I didn't see any multiplayer action.

272
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,470
Scott: I mean, there might be, but I didn't try it out.

273
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,826
Rym: I've been too busy playing, I don't know, Counter-Strike, NS2, FTL.

274
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:53,650
Scott: It is mad buggy.

275
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:58,030
Scott: It barely worked like the audio didn't work and it crashed.

276
00:13:58,311 --> 00:14:00,049
Scott: And people said the same things online.

277
00:14:00,511 --> 00:14:01,689
Scott: A lot of people had problems with it.

278
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:04,210
Scott: Some people didn't have any problems, bad problems.

279
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,650
Scott: I'm going to try it on some different machine, see what happens.

280
00:14:07,412 --> 00:14:10,270
Scott: And it's actually kind of fun, clever game.

281
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:16,650
Scott: The way it works is it's sort of a straight top down situation, like litter, not three quarters, not isometric, straight down.

282
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:26,430
Scott: And you're this criminal dude and you're sitting at home and you get a phone call and the phone calls like, hey, I need you to do this job, usually involving killing people or stealing something.

283
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:33,850
Scott: So you go and get in a car and they drive you somewhere and you get out and you put on a mask and the different masks have different abilities.

284
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,366
Scott: It was like Rooster, Al, you know, whatever.

285
00:14:38,052 --> 00:14:41,070
Scott: And then you go to town on these guys in this building.

286
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:45,970
Scott: So it's actually pretty hard because all the bad guys are really smart.

287
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,989
Scott: If a guy with a gun sees you, he shoots you and he doesn't really miss.

288
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:53,530
Scott: See, and it's like if you hit someone with melee weapons, not everyone will hear.

289
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:55,350
Scott: So you can use only melee weapons.

290
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:59,410
Scott: You can sort of go slowly and go one room at a time taking guys out.

291
00:14:59,891 --> 00:15:13,729
Scott: But if there's a room, for example, with a guy on patrol behind the door and another guy sitting on the couch or the gun, you have to like open the door on the first guy to knock him down, get to the guy with the gun before he shoots you, then kill the guy.

292
00:15:14,092 --> 00:15:15,766
Scott: You knock down or use a gun.

293
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,928
Scott: But if you use a gun, everyone in the whole map frickin hears it and starts running straight at you.

294
00:15:20,611 --> 00:15:23,930
Scott: So it's like this pretty challenging kind of fun action game.

295
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,030
Scott: And I kind of wish it wasn't mad buggy.

296
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:27,965
Rym: So how buggy is it?

297
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,770
Scott: They know the sound effects work.

298
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:36,030
Scott: The music did not work, which is disappointing because the credits talked about, you know, we're like music by so-and-so.

299
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,130
Scott: And I was like, man, I bet these songs are probably really good.

300
00:15:39,037 --> 00:15:39,588
Scott: I can't hear them.

301
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:44,730
Rym: Yeah, there's been a nice trend for good music and games like particular like FTL has an amazing soundtrack.

302
00:15:45,171 --> 00:15:48,290
Scott: It's pretty crashy, a little bit, a little bit of video errors.

303
00:15:48,892 --> 00:15:52,130
Scott: If you put it in, I tried to put it in Xbox 360 gamepad mode.

304
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:58,890
Scott: It was a little bit flaky and putting it in gamepad mode because I was playing on the HDBC made it not work with the keyboard anymore.

305
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,249
Scott: It's one or the other, not both.

306
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,268
Scott: What the hell, guys?

307
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:02,540
Scott: It's come on.

308
00:16:02,763 --> 00:16:03,370
Scott: That's basic.

309
00:16:03,974 --> 00:16:05,026
Scott: That's, you know, step one.

310
00:16:05,651 --> 00:16:06,307
Scott: Everything should work.

311
00:16:07,993 --> 00:16:12,010
Scott: You know, but other than that, like if this game worked, it'd be awesome.

312
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:16,649
Scott: And I heard, I guess there's going to be a Hotline Miami, too, which I hope will not be as buggy.

313
00:16:17,112 --> 00:16:19,970
Scott: In other news, Magical Drop V is out.

314
00:16:20,934 --> 00:16:22,408
Rym: I heard you had some trouble with that one, too.

315
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:28,790
Scott: So Magical Drop V is, from everything I can tell, the ultimate in Magical Drop.

316
00:16:29,311 --> 00:16:36,250
Scott: All the characters, a bunch of crazy modes, works on the PC, modern graphics, modern software, modern everything.

317
00:16:36,432 --> 00:16:37,930
Scott: But it's fucking magical drop.

318
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:38,778
Scott: Hells yeah.

319
00:16:39,304 --> 00:16:39,729
Scott: Let's go.

320
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:40,273
Scott: Justice.

321
00:16:40,313 --> 00:16:41,709
Rym: Where's my battle balls?

322
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,530
Scott: Justice is the best, right?

323
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:48,950
Scott: But if you go to the Steam forums for this game, this game is super crashy.

324
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:52,810
Scott: Doesn't even launch crazy bugs for all kinds of people.

325
00:16:53,952 --> 00:16:58,466
Scott: But the guy who makes it, who doesn't speak very good English, he keeps posting.

326
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:08,970
Scott: He's actively in that forum thread as recently as a few hours ago on the Steam forums, telling people of all the bugs they're going to fix and how they're going to work on Saturday and do all this stuff to me.

327
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,469
Scott: So there's a free demo.

328
00:17:11,413 --> 00:17:12,989
Scott: I downloaded the demo on my work PC.

329
00:17:13,954 --> 00:17:14,790
Scott: I didn't even launch.

330
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,901
Scott: I click play in steam and it said starting.

331
00:17:17,343 --> 00:17:21,050
Scott: the little steam dialog box disappeared and then nothing happened and the game did not launch.

332
00:17:21,471 --> 00:17:24,609
Scott: I'm going to try the demo on some other computers to see if it works on those.

333
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,310
Scott: So I recommend doing the same right.

334
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:34,833
Scott: If you can get the demo to work without flaws or crashing, then it's probably worth the 10 bucks if you try it, because I do have a magical drought.

335
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,510
Rym: I do have a butt old video card.

336
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:49,329
Scott: I got a GTX 260, but if the demo to 60 beware, though, because I did read in the in the in that forum thread, there were some discussions about how you should go to your services and turn off the print spooler.

337
00:17:49,891 --> 00:17:50,193
Rym: Yeah.

338
00:17:50,395 --> 00:17:53,509
Rym: So I was going to say something about that in the forum and the thread about this.

339
00:17:54,594 --> 00:17:55,909
Rym: If that is ever the answer.

340
00:17:57,472 --> 00:17:58,664
Scott: That is not the answer.

341
00:17:58,745 --> 00:17:59,210
Scott: Exactly.

342
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:09,530
Scott: Also, I was reading that like one guy had the game working perfectly and he was playing through the story mode and he got really far in like level something level, you know, who know, deep in the game.

343
00:18:09,952 --> 00:18:11,790
Scott: And then a certain level is making it crash.

344
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:12,817
Scott: So he couldn't get past that.

345
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,289
Scott: And like that is the worst.

346
00:18:14,933 --> 00:18:15,116
Scott: Right.

347
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:21,330
Scott: Because you could be fooled, even if you do the demo to see if it's going to work and then you pay for it and then you can't beat it because it's buggy.

348
00:18:21,772 --> 00:18:24,070
Scott: So maybe you should wait like a few weeks on this one.

349
00:18:24,511 --> 00:18:28,249
Scott: See if this guy or the development team is actually going to fix it, like they say.

350
00:18:29,111 --> 00:18:32,909
Scott: And I think they will fix a lot of the bugs if they're if they're actively posting in the steam forum.

351
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:38,910
Scott: I trust that they're actually going to do something, but I'm not going to give them the money until I see that something.

352
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:39,970
Rym: Yeah, we'll see how it goes.

353
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:41,109
Scott: Meaning the demo runs.

354
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:46,370
Rym: Not only do I have plenty of games, but I bought X-Com while I was on sale.

355
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,033
Scott: I did not.

356
00:18:47,073 --> 00:18:47,878
Scott: You know how much?

357
00:18:48,139 --> 00:18:49,789
Rym: you know how much I've played of it?

358
00:18:50,092 --> 00:18:50,336
Rym: Nothing.

359
00:18:50,376 --> 00:18:51,169
Rym: According to Steam.

360
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:51,855
Scott: Zero.

361
00:18:52,201 --> 00:18:52,770
Rym: Three minutes.

362
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:53,392
Scott: All right.

363
00:18:53,473 --> 00:18:59,130
Rym: I started it and I started playing through the sort of like, here's how to play the game.

364
00:18:59,312 --> 00:19:01,030
Scott: And it was X-Com and it was great.

365
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:03,630
Rym: And then I stopped playing it to go play Counter-Strike.

366
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,355
Scott: There you go.

367
00:19:04,638 --> 00:19:05,929
Scott: So so there you go.

368
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,749
Scott: Magical Drop V Hotline Miami.

369
00:19:08,972 --> 00:19:10,129
Rym: What else did I buy?

370
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:13,570
Scott: Pretty good games that were mad cheap during the sales.

371
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:14,718
Scott: Still kind of cheap.

372
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,949
Rym: Speaking of a man.

373
00:19:16,731 --> 00:19:20,949
Rym: Guns of Icarus online was on sale and so was and is as of right now.

374
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:22,628
Rym: Counter-Strike go.

375
00:19:23,152 --> 00:19:27,130
Scott: There was actually a kind of complete seven dollars and fifty cents.

376
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,450
Scott: There was a Counter-Strike complete pack that was ten bucks.

377
00:19:29,491 --> 00:19:31,030
Scott: They got you every Counter-Strike ever.

378
00:19:31,553 --> 00:19:33,510
Scott: If you didn't have any of them, that was a good deal.

379
00:19:33,651 --> 00:19:40,790
Scott: And also super hexagon for anyone doesn't have an iPhone or iPad is now on the Steam store for like two dollars.

380
00:19:41,392 --> 00:19:44,250
Scott: And the PC version might be much more playable than the iPhone version.

381
00:19:44,732 --> 00:19:47,689
Scott: And in addition, they have a two pack for three dollars and change.

382
00:19:48,632 --> 00:19:55,769
Scott: Since I already have the iOS one Rym should buy the two pack for three dollars and give me the other one, because I think on the PC I could do much better than I could on the phone.

383
00:19:56,512 --> 00:20:00,549
Rym: Sadly, though, if you want to you want to see where the state of all that is right now.

384
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,969
Rym: Dota two is still far and away the most popular game on Steam.

385
00:20:04,191 --> 00:20:05,828
Scott: Yeah, it has been for quite a while now.

386
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,728
Rym: Football manager number two.

387
00:20:08,011 --> 00:20:09,029
Scott: That's always been up there.

388
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,228
Rym: Team Fortress two is next.

389
00:20:12,151 --> 00:20:14,310
Rym: Civ five has had a huge resurgence.

390
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:17,550
Scott: Well, they just had that gods and kings thing was on super sale.

391
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,410
Scott: And it was also a Civ five super pack during the sale.

392
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:25,530
Scott: So a bunch of people who never bought Civ five all bought the whole thing for mad cheap with an expansion.

393
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,729
Rym: So number five is Counter-Strike one six.

394
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:29,746
Scott: There you go.

395
00:20:29,971 --> 00:20:33,429
Rym: Global Offensive is down to number 10 and source is even below that.

396
00:20:33,915 --> 00:20:34,548
Rym: Oh, yeah.

397
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:38,250
Rym: Global Offensive only has, you know, 20 ish thousand players.

398
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,969
Scott: That's because half the people got banned for leaving competitive games early.

399
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:41,431
Scott: Yeah.

400
00:20:42,173 --> 00:20:51,370
Scott: See, Civ five actually, you know, has a inflated concurrent player figure because you play Civ five for longer amounts of time.

401
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:51,770
Scott: Right.

402
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:58,830
Scott: So a lot is, you know, more players will overlap to get a higher peak number, whereas a game with a shorter plate.

403
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,809
Rym: Not because the current number is also higher at any given point.

404
00:21:02,351 --> 00:21:06,249
Scott: OK, no, that's what I'm saying is that they're showing you a current number and they're showing a peak.

405
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:10,610
Rym: So the current of those, the current and peak are almost identical all the time.

406
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:14,670
Rym: Meanwhile, Counter-Strike's peak is more than double its current at any given time.

407
00:21:14,892 --> 00:21:15,075
Scott: Right.

408
00:21:15,095 --> 00:21:16,189
Scott: But this is what I'm saying at the peak.

409
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:23,190
Scott: This is what I'm telling you is those numbers are numbers of players simultaneously either now or at some point during the day.

410
00:21:23,651 --> 00:21:23,852
Scott: Right.

411
00:21:23,972 --> 00:21:28,753
Scott: It is not the total number of people who have played at some point at any time today.

412
00:21:29,178 --> 00:21:30,289
Scott: None of those numbers are that.

413
00:21:30,511 --> 00:21:30,772
Scott: Right.

414
00:21:30,892 --> 00:21:31,194
Scott: Oh, yeah.

415
00:21:31,254 --> 00:21:35,092
Scott: So Civ five, that peak number, because you play that game for hours at a time.

416
00:21:35,172 --> 00:21:35,373
Scott: Right.

417
00:21:35,815 --> 00:21:40,089
Scott: That is probably much closer to the total number of people who have played at any point today.

418
00:21:40,631 --> 00:21:40,952
Scott: Right.

419
00:21:41,294 --> 00:21:46,609
Scott: Whereas the Counter-Strike number, it's like, yeah, OK, there might only be twenty thousand people playing Counter-Strike right now.

420
00:21:47,031 --> 00:22:11,250
Scott: But if we add up anyone who has launched and played a single round of Counter-Strike during the entire 24 past 24 hours, that number is probably well above the peak and current numbers, which is why I wish they would give you that third number of number of people who have played this game at all in the past 24 hours, as opposed to only these two figures that are number of players at the same exact moment.

421
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:16,148
Scott: Now, a number of players at the same exact moment at any time in the past 24 hours.

422
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,200
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

423
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:28,420
Rym: This is a video I saw this weekend.

424
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:33,500
Rym: It is an ad for the Central Institute of Technology in Western Australia.

425
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,859
Scott: Well, we're not going close to that.

426
00:22:35,424 --> 00:22:36,620
Rym: And it's a snap.

427
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:41,820
Rym: It's kind of a spoof on sort of the kinds of ads you see for colleges.

428
00:22:42,565 --> 00:22:43,600
Rym: It's actually pretty funny.

429
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:45,238
Rym: And I recommend you watch to the end.

430
00:22:45,624 --> 00:22:46,258
Scott: OK, is that it?

431
00:22:46,561 --> 00:22:55,820
Rym: The only thing I have to say is that this is kind of a sanctioned ad for the university, which makes me really respect that university.

432
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:56,640
Scott: OK.

433
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:01,025
Rym: Not that I'm going to ever visit that place because it's in the western side of Australia.

434
00:23:01,652 --> 00:23:02,278
Scott: Maybe one day.

435
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,300
Scott: So we know in the world, right, there are instruments that everyone knows.

436
00:23:08,002 --> 00:23:12,267
Scott: And then there are the weird instruments that are slightly weird, but they're still normal.

437
00:23:12,348 --> 00:23:13,120
Scott: You see them played.

438
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,130
Scott: They're useful, right?

439
00:23:14,151 --> 00:23:14,840
Scott: Like oboes.

440
00:23:15,081 --> 00:23:20,399
Scott: It's like, you know, a lot of people on the street, maybe most of them wouldn't even know an oboe if they saw one.

441
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,140
Scott: But orchestras fucking use oboes.

442
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,559
Scott: If you go, there's going to be an oboe there.

443
00:23:24,742 --> 00:23:29,462
Scott: But then there are other instruments that are very rare because they're very not useful.

444
00:23:29,522 --> 00:23:35,338
Scott: But someone invented them and some crazy instrument making guy somewhere produced some number of them.

445
00:23:35,962 --> 00:23:37,780
Scott: And they're good for novelty reasons.

446
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:43,861
Scott: And extremely weird musical pieces might require one or two weird instruments of some kind.

447
00:23:44,784 --> 00:23:51,379
Scott: So here I have a video of this dude named Jose Valentino, and he is playing a double contrabass flute.

448
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:57,180
Rym: Now, a contrabass flute, a single one is already a rarely if ever used.

449
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,378
Scott: OK, so he plays this.

450
00:23:58,961 --> 00:24:03,940
Scott: He kind of the video is kind of backwards because he plays the double contrabass and then plays the single contrabass.

451
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:07,960
Scott: I would have played the single and then been like, all right, here's the double.

452
00:24:08,404 --> 00:24:09,779
Scott: Oh, but he does the double first.

453
00:24:10,801 --> 00:24:15,240
Scott: The double one basically is so bass, you can barely hear it.

454
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:20,482
Scott: You hear his the air coming out of his mouth going like more than you hear the bass from the flute.

455
00:24:20,744 --> 00:24:23,560
Scott: They could just be because of the way it was recorded.

456
00:24:23,681 --> 00:24:26,140
Scott: And maybe if you're in the room with him, you would hear the flute.

457
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:34,560
Rym: No, like I'll say this when I you know, when I was in a jazz band, we had a bass flute flautist for a single bass flat, which is slightly weird, but still a useful instrument.

458
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:40,459
Rym: But the thing is, that was only used for these sort of hunting accents or beatboxing solos and nothing else.

459
00:24:41,081 --> 00:24:41,242
Scott: Yep.

460
00:24:41,262 --> 00:24:49,120
Scott: So the single contrabass flute, however, while also extremely weird and not so useful, you can actually hear it in the in the YouTube video.

461
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,107
Scott: It sounds pretty good.

462
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:52,060
Scott: You can make some good music with that thing.

463
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,878
Scott: That would be enjoyable to people.

464
00:24:54,841 --> 00:24:59,640
Rym: So in the meta moment, the book club book was The Name of the Wind by Patrick Roth Fuss.

465
00:25:00,224 --> 00:25:00,810
Rym: It's all done.

466
00:25:00,871 --> 00:25:01,620
Rym: The episode's up.

467
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,343
Rym: Everything's out.

468
00:25:02,725 --> 00:25:08,820
Rym: The new book club, which I'm going to start up soon as I type it all in, is The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald.

469
00:25:10,282 --> 00:25:10,886
Rym: It's a classic.

470
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:12,600
Rym: You guys should read it if you haven't read it.

471
00:25:12,941 --> 00:25:16,399
Rym: I haven't read it, so I don't feel dumb unless you don't read it by the time I read it.

472
00:25:16,922 --> 00:25:18,700
Scott: I also have not read it, but I have begun.

473
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,998
Scott: I read a few pages.

474
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,880
Rym: I read reading other book, three quarters of the second book in the Kingkiller Chronicle.

475
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:24,486
Rym: And you know what?

476
00:25:24,931 --> 00:25:25,759
Rym: I'm done with those books.

477
00:25:26,281 --> 00:25:27,080
Scott: So bad news.

478
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,976
Scott: I do want to say, though, it's currently it's about to be December, right?

479
00:25:31,201 --> 00:25:38,557
Scott: So the episode for the book club book might occur in late December, if not after Magfest.

480
00:25:38,577 --> 00:25:38,740
Scott: Right.

481
00:25:39,562 --> 00:25:44,900
Scott: It's either going to be right before New Year's when I have a week off of work or it's going to be after Magfest.

482
00:25:45,201 --> 00:25:45,404
Scott: Right.

483
00:25:45,606 --> 00:25:46,980
Scott: So you have some time to read this mother.

484
00:25:47,501 --> 00:25:47,643
Rym: Yeah.

485
00:25:47,684 --> 00:25:48,979
Rym: That's why I haven't even updated it yet.

486
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:49,342
Rym: Yeah.

487
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:50,940
Scott: Any other metamol?

488
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,520
Rym: We have an official GeekNights' Counter Strike Global Offensive server.

489
00:25:56,241 --> 00:26:01,622
Rym: If you want to play Counter Strike Global Offensive with us and people in our forum, go to it.

490
00:26:01,682 --> 00:26:04,560
Rym: It is geeknight.game.nfoservers.com.

491
00:26:04,681 --> 00:26:07,679
Rym: That's geeknight.game.nfoservers.com.

492
00:26:07,921 --> 00:26:09,420
Scott: Sunday, Sunday, Saturday.

493
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:17,564
Rym: So also very briefly, a while ago, Dude emailed us with a question and Scott covered this in the newsletter.

494
00:26:17,584 --> 00:26:26,686
Rym: So one, if you're not subscribed to the GeekNights' email newsletter, you should because it has content that is not in the show, not on the website, not in the forum.

495
00:26:26,929 --> 00:26:27,859
Scott: And people read it.

496
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:32,340
Scott: And so far, nobody is unsubscribed from it, which you'll find strange.

497
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,680
Rym: It's a it's a good newsletter.

498
00:26:33,781 --> 00:26:36,499
Rym: Scott does a good job and has its own thing of the day and everything.

499
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:45,580
Rym: But SR.UpperCase A sent us some questions and I said, oh, I will answer these on the show the next time we record a Tuesday show.

500
00:26:46,381 --> 00:26:52,849
Rym: We basically hadn't recorded a normal Tuesday show since then because we'd recorded ahead and then we had hurricane.

501
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:54,120
Rym: All this all this stuff happened.

502
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:59,079
Rym: So this is the first show that I'm live recording since I said I would do that.

503
00:27:00,063 --> 00:27:01,840
Rym: OK, so I would like to answer the question.

504
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:08,120
Rym: Now, if you subscribe to the newsletter, you can see that Scott gave his own answer to this question as well, which I would not agree with my answer.

505
00:27:08,602 --> 00:27:10,159
Rym: No, I'm just not going to paraphrase it here.

506
00:27:10,801 --> 00:27:14,947
Rym: They'll have to subscribe to the newsletter to get future ones and to find out what was in that one.

507
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:15,860
Rym: They'd better make a friend.

508
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,220
Rym: I hear there's an underground swapping market for old newsletters.

509
00:27:20,081 --> 00:27:24,320
Scott: I think MailChimp actually hosts HTML versions of the newsletters on their site.

510
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,445
Scott: If you can get the links like.

511
00:27:25,485 --> 00:27:31,580
Scott: if you go to the newsletter email and you click on like, you know, view this email in your browser, you'll get a URL.

512
00:27:31,741 --> 00:27:33,330
Scott: And you can just share that URL and that'll.

513
00:27:33,772 --> 00:27:35,582
Scott: anyone can use that URL to read the newsletter.

514
00:27:36,164 --> 00:27:40,263
Rym: So first of all, regarding Rims Post, do cheap tactics ruin online multiplayer?

515
00:27:40,303 --> 00:27:43,400
Rym: Rims states that if you are playing in a competitive game, you play to win.

516
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,351
Scott: You're going to read this whole thing?

517
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:44,879
Rym: Not the whole thing.

518
00:27:45,181 --> 00:27:47,920
Rym: By any means necessary without cheating.

519
00:27:48,461 --> 00:27:55,060
Rym: I understand your point, but don't you think there is a line beyond which there is no point in winning because you are not playing the same game anymore?

520
00:27:55,921 --> 00:28:01,606
Rym: And don't you think it's unethical to use cheap tactics that were not meant to be there like snaking?

521
00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:03,495
Rym: And an example is provided here.

522
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,903
Rym: Imagine if in Mario Kart DS, if you could hit a hundred times, you would instantly win the race.

523
00:28:11,808 --> 00:28:13,700
Rym: Should you use that or not?

524
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:17,663
Scott: Well, can the guy get around the track the right the normal way before you press a hundred?

525
00:28:17,743 --> 00:28:20,120
Rym: Let's say there's no chance of that.

526
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,499
Scott: OK, because if he can do that, then you probably want to raise because pressing a hundred times is not going to win before someone else wins.

527
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:34,560
Rym: So, of course, my opinion is that in general, any game that has a tactic that is so cheap that it can win the game trivially is a very poorly designed game.

528
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:34,842
Scott: Right.

529
00:28:34,862 --> 00:28:35,549
Scott: Well, cheapness.

530
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:35,771
Scott: Right.

531
00:28:35,812 --> 00:28:36,560
Scott: What is cheapness?

532
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,143
Scott: Cheapness?

533
00:28:37,163 --> 00:28:39,600
Rym: Did you get to the chapter in Garfield's book on what cheap is yet?

534
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,449
Scott: I already know what it is.

535
00:28:40,489 --> 00:28:41,259
Scott: I need to read that.

536
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:52,860
Scott: It's cheapness is when you have a tactic or move or strategy available in a game that is legal, that is extremely low effort, is extremely easy to do.

537
00:28:53,120 --> 00:29:01,086
Scott: Anyone can figure it out and execute it trivially, but is extremely powerful and puts you way ahead.

538
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,780
Rym: It's to be like a very high return on investment.

539
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,122
Scott: Yes.

540
00:29:04,162 --> 00:29:14,539
Scott: It's like if you're playing Street Fighter and it's like there was one guy, a new character and his jab did a half life bar of damage, that would be cheap because anyone can push the chuck and jab button.

541
00:29:14,942 --> 00:29:17,260
Scott: It's so easy and it takes away so much damage.

542
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:18,780
Scott: Why would you choose any other character?

543
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:25,878
Scott: Whereas to do a half bar of damage with someone else, you maybe need to execute a combo, which is rather difficult and you need to get it to hit.

544
00:29:26,602 --> 00:29:30,660
Scott: Yeah, so that's that's what cheap is, is low effort, high reward.

545
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,579
Rym: Now I play to win.

546
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,820
Rym: So, for example, Mario Kart DS, I only ever snaked once you knew you could do it.

547
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,841
Rym: As soon as I learned to do it, I snaked because that was the strategy to beat the game.

548
00:29:41,861 --> 00:29:46,300
Rym: There's no way I was going to let myself lose a race that I could win.

549
00:29:46,763 --> 00:29:48,920
Rym: And as a result, I ended up not playing the game much.

550
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:56,219
Rym: Now, it would have been fine to play to try to play the game and kind of patch around that by saying like, no snaking.

551
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:04,060
Rym: But then you have to very extremely precisely define what snaking means and it becomes a prisoner's dilemma situation.

552
00:30:04,281 --> 00:30:07,660
Scott: See, the way I see it is I wish they would have just implemented the same.

553
00:30:08,102 --> 00:30:10,040
Scott: It's going to talk about Mario Kart because everyone loves it.

554
00:30:10,281 --> 00:30:10,462
Scott: Why not?

555
00:30:10,482 --> 00:30:12,740
Rym: Mario Kart is such a great example of all these things.

556
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,740
Scott: Super Mario Kart, Super Circuit, the best one.

557
00:30:15,302 --> 00:30:18,060
Scott: You could only get blue sparks once per corner.

558
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:21,480
Scott: You couldn't just sort of like slide sideways in a straightaway.

559
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,880
Scott: That fucking didn't do shit, right?

560
00:30:23,241 --> 00:30:31,100
Scott: If you went around a corner perfectly with the drift, right, it would give you one blue spark as your reward.

561
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,076
Scott: And that was all you could do, right?

562
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:37,200
Scott: That was that was the maximum sneakiness you could get out of that game.

563
00:30:37,922 --> 00:30:40,720
Scott: And I think if they would have just that's sort of what they intended.

564
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:46,580
Scott: You know, if you look at, you know, say what's the one with the two people double dash, it was sort of the same idea.

565
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:54,820
Scott: If the other character sitting in the backseat shifts the way to help you go around the corner faster with the drift, you would get the blue sparks.

566
00:30:55,382 --> 00:30:57,440
Scott: And that was the intent of the mechanic.

567
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:07,900
Scott: The problem wasn't how they programmed it is that you could just if the if the straightaway was wide enough, you could drift in the middle of it and would give you sparks and you could just keep doing it over and over.

568
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,482
Rym: Now, one, I would argue that it's pointless to argue what the intent of the games.

569
00:31:11,664 --> 00:31:13,180
Scott: I agree with that as well.

570
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,603
Scott: But the only reason I know the intent is because of Super Mario Kart, Super Circuit.

571
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,700
Rym: Yeah, but that could still be argued.

572
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:20,327
Scott: It is.

573
00:31:20,367 --> 00:31:20,650
Scott: I admit that.

574
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:33,633
Scott: But I'm just saying is that if I were going to create rules to police a Mario Kart DS tournament and I wanted to eliminate snaking, the rule would be you can get blue if you get more than if you get a blue spark.

575
00:31:33,673 --> 00:31:34,920
Scott: that is not on a corner.

576
00:31:35,522 --> 00:31:38,358
Rym: And what defines the corners is a slight bend in the track count.

577
00:31:40,101 --> 00:31:43,179
Scott: It's we would define the corners on every single track what they are.

578
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:43,703
Rym: Yeah.

579
00:31:44,025 --> 00:31:46,360
Rym: So how do you officiate that without spectators?

580
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,445
Scott: We would have a spec.

581
00:31:47,466 --> 00:31:49,540
Scott: We would need a spectator for every single driver.

582
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:49,942
Rym: All right.

583
00:31:49,962 --> 00:31:50,564
Rym: So now you're.

584
00:31:50,705 --> 00:31:51,207
Rym: now you're.

585
00:31:51,469 --> 00:31:54,443
Rym: you have fallible humans and no way to do a replay.

586
00:31:54,583 --> 00:31:57,680
Scott: We would have a video also of the entire race.

587
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,635
Rym: So what is the punishment for snaking?

588
00:32:00,735 --> 00:32:01,620
Scott: disqualification?

589
00:32:02,322 --> 00:32:02,645
Rym: All right.

590
00:32:02,806 --> 00:32:03,835
Scott: Or you could do it like so.

591
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,320
Scott: So here's what you restart the race, like if someone has a false start.

592
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,839
Rym: So here's what I'm getting at.

593
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:15,333
Rym: If a bunch of players agree to change the rules of the game, it is technically a different game, but so on.

594
00:32:15,414 --> 00:32:15,758
Rym: We're fine.

595
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:16,504
Rym: It's still.

596
00:32:16,545 --> 00:32:18,040
Scott: it's like you play Magic in a tournament.

597
00:32:18,141 --> 00:32:19,520
Scott: Certain cards are banned, right?

598
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,020
Rym: It's the same, but it's still magic.

599
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,600
Rym: But it's like magic, you know, version one dot eight dot seven.

600
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,042
Rym: Exactly.

601
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:33,725
Rym: So but there's still magic in the sense of the history and the word means kind of like how hockey is still hockey, even though the rules have been different every year.

602
00:32:34,487 --> 00:32:40,580
Rym: But the difference is that here what Scott's talking about, we have all these people playing together in person.

603
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:46,721
Rym: We have a way to an objective, external way to enforce the rule we have all agreed upon.

604
00:32:47,303 --> 00:33:02,082
Rym: The only way you could really play Mario Kart online or even in person, in most cases, was such that there is no possible way to enforce a rule of no snaking and even worse in online play, because Nintendo doesn't let you talk to people.

605
00:33:02,524 --> 00:33:05,440
Rym: There is no way to even enforce a social contract.

606
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:12,980
Rym: There is no way to interact with the other players and come to consensus or to punish someone who doesn't follow the rule.

607
00:33:13,302 --> 00:33:16,740
Rym: The only way you can even have the rule is by putting it like in your name.

608
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,120
Scott: Yeah.

609
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:21,587
Scott: Even if you could start a race and say no snaking and everyone said, yes, I agree.

610
00:33:21,649 --> 00:33:22,180
Scott: No snaking.

611
00:33:22,863 --> 00:33:25,120
Scott: You still couldn't define snaking amongst you.

612
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:33,783
Scott: So someone's inevitably going to do something someone else considers to be snaking and when and the other people like, oh, no, we allow two sparks, two sparks.

613
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:36,200
Scott: And it becomes playground rules again, right?

614
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,219
Scott: Where it's like, you know, no backseas.

615
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,189
Scott: You didn't shoot me.

616
00:33:39,229 --> 00:33:40,059
Rym: Yes, I did.

617
00:33:40,441 --> 00:33:40,806
Scott: Yeah.

618
00:33:41,231 --> 00:33:41,920
Scott: All right.

619
00:33:42,001 --> 00:33:43,580
Scott: So we can't have that bullshit.

620
00:33:44,402 --> 00:33:44,582
Rym: Yep.

621
00:33:44,602 --> 00:34:00,843
Rym: So rules, mods like that to change the rules of a game, to eliminate a cheap tactic only work if you have a strong social contract that can actually enforce the rule and you can all agree what the change should be before you start, which

622
00:34:00,944 --> 00:34:07,412
Scott: usually means you're playing a game in a room with friends together and you have a social contract or you're playing in a strict tournament setting.

623
00:34:08,221 --> 00:34:18,299
Rym: But for example, if I started losing it all in a Mario Kart online, even if I hadn't snaked up to that point, I would snake whenever no one could see me to catch up because I want to win.

624
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,101
Scott: Right.

625
00:34:19,201 --> 00:34:26,360
Scott: You know, it's like if you could if you could decide to restart a hundred meter dash, if you're behind, it's like, yeah, I'll restart it a hundred times until I'm not.

626
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,420
Rym: But for example, the thing we always use in lectures is counter strike.

627
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:37,600
Rym: If you if you really think that the AWP is OP, you as the server administrator, just remove it from the list of weapons people can buy.

628
00:34:38,023 --> 00:34:38,818
Rym: Totally enforced.

629
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:39,380
Scott: Yeah.

630
00:34:39,824 --> 00:34:41,739
Rym: So briefly, and then we'll get on to the rest of the show.

631
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,560
Rym: The other question changing subject.

632
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:45,579
Rym: You think cheating can be considered metagaming?

633
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,000
Rym: One could say that cheating is only invalid if you get caught.

634
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:52,304
Rym: So using a strategy to cheat without getting caught wouldn't be metagaming.

635
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:55,076
Rym: Of course, I'm only talk about cheating in a way you get caught, blah, blah, blah, blah.

636
00:34:55,982 --> 00:34:58,140
Rym: And the answer to that is complicated.

637
00:34:58,601 --> 00:35:03,719
Rym: What I would say is that, again, it depends on the social contract and the ramifications of cheating.

638
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:08,420
Scott: For example, is he asking if all cheating is metagaming or is he asking if metagaming is cheating?

639
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,580
Rym: Do you think cheating can be considered metagaming?

640
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,500
Scott: There's cheating that is not metagaming and there's cheating that might be considered metagaming.

641
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,179
Rym: So let's start with examples first.

642
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:23,000
Rym: Briefly, if I cheat in hockey, I have too many men on the ice.

643
00:35:23,662 --> 00:35:26,820
Rym: The rules actually say how that is enforced.

644
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,140
Scott: Yeah, it's not metagaming at all.

645
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,040
Rym: Enforcing it is part of the rules.

646
00:35:30,162 --> 00:35:31,160
Rym: It's part of the game.

647
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:40,002
Rym: A coach might make the decision to put too many men out for a brief period, especially in, you know, like college games, hoping the refs won't notice.

648
00:35:40,364 --> 00:35:45,859
Rym: And that while cheating, there is a mechanic for resolving that action.

649
00:35:46,001 --> 00:35:47,240
Scott: It's not cheating.

650
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,107
Scott: It's completely.

651
00:35:48,167 --> 00:35:52,220
Scott: it's actually I would argue that, you know, too many men on the ice, you know, is it cheating?

652
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,470
Scott: It's like, well, yes, you're not.

653
00:35:53,631 --> 00:35:54,720
Scott: it's a rule against that.

654
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,660
Scott: You are breaking the rule.

655
00:35:55,841 --> 00:35:58,200
Scott: But at the same time, the game handles that.

656
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,180
Scott: You go in the box as a penalty for it.

657
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,859
Scott: You haven't broken the game by doing this.

658
00:36:03,362 --> 00:36:03,543
Scott: Right.

659
00:36:03,563 --> 00:36:05,339
Scott: You've just broken a rule of the game.

660
00:36:05,921 --> 00:36:06,463
Scott: But it's there.

661
00:36:06,503 --> 00:36:11,660
Rym: But there is a built in rule and means of mitigating that and continuing the game.

662
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,061
Scott: Exactly.

663
00:36:12,081 --> 00:36:15,226
Rym: The game isn't immediately an asterisk if there's too many men on the ice.

664
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:16,920
Scott: Instead, it's not cheating.

665
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:19,640
Scott: Like, you know, I had cards up my sleeve in poker.

666
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:34,860
Rym: So if there is an in-game punishment to deal with a contextual result of the cheating and a means of dealing with it and continuing the game without placing the game under a sort of asterisk situation, then it is not actually cheating.

667
00:36:35,222 --> 00:36:42,379
Rym: For example, soccer taking falls and all these other forms of, you know, quote unquote, cheating are a core part of the strategy of soccer.

668
00:36:42,782 --> 00:36:42,943
Scott: Yeah.

669
00:36:43,024 --> 00:36:45,379
Scott: I mean, there are rules for it, but they don't fucking enforce them.

670
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,560
Rym: Or in Fury of Dracula, a board game.

671
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:54,585
Rym: If Dracula fucks up or cheats and is caught, there are rules for what happens.

672
00:36:54,666 --> 00:36:57,420
Scott: So in the book, exactly what to do if Dracula fucks up.

673
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,519
Rym: In which case it would be a perfectly legitimate strategy.

674
00:37:01,082 --> 00:37:05,075
Scott: Shady Dracula is to avoid and not get caught.

675
00:37:05,175 --> 00:37:08,840
Rym: shady and maybe a little cheap, but not cheating in this sense.

676
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,500
Rym: Now, take a game of Puerto Rico.

677
00:37:11,122 --> 00:37:19,382
Rym: If I just fucking take a building when no one's looking one, I've violated something much more severe than the rules of a game like hockey.

678
00:37:19,402 --> 00:37:26,460
Rym: I've violated the social contract among my friends because there is literally nothing in the rules to address that situation.

679
00:37:27,022 --> 00:37:36,242
Rym: If a player violates the rules of a board game like Puerto Rico, there is no possible recourse except outside the game, stopping the game.

680
00:37:36,665 --> 00:37:38,640
Rym: If you notice it too late, the game is done.

681
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:46,679
Rym: There's no way to fix that short of having perfect memory and stepping back through the game to the point it happened and then continuing after preventing the action.

682
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,799
Rym: You basically have to stop playing the game.

683
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:58,105
Rym: And since there is no way in the rules to deal with it, the only way to deal with it is via the social contract of not being friends with that person anymore.

684
00:37:58,607 --> 00:38:07,498
Rym: So in my opinion, it is only cheating if the rules of the game do not address a contextual means of resolving it.

685
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:20,278
Scott: Yeah, I mean, if the rules of the game say, you know, if you trip the guy in hockey, you get two minutes in the box, then, you know, you probably shouldn't trip a guy because you want to win.

686
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:27,640
Rym: But for example, if I hold out a knife and stabbed a dude on the ice in the middle of a hockey game, that game would be asterisk.

687
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,380
Rym: They'd probably replay it later.

688
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:30,839
Rym: I'd go to jail.

689
00:38:31,963 --> 00:38:35,120
Rym: Yeah, it's not like the ref's going to be like, oh, stabbing, four minutes.

690
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,620
Scott: Yeah, but, you know, tripping a guy, it's like, well, you did it.

691
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,206
Scott: It happens.

692
00:38:39,267 --> 00:38:40,340
Scott: It happens a lot, right?

693
00:38:40,481 --> 00:38:42,440
Scott: It's like we don't suddenly hate you or anything.

694
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,639
Scott: But, you know, or maybe you do.

695
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,266
Rym: But it's part.

696
00:38:44,307 --> 00:38:45,360
Rym: it's a cheap tactic, maybe.

697
00:38:45,522 --> 00:38:46,478
Rym: But it's part of the game.

698
00:38:47,301 --> 00:38:50,860
Rym: But doing something that the rules do not address is cheating.

699
00:38:52,002 --> 00:38:54,120
Rym: Anyway, anyway, that might have been a little long.

700
00:38:54,221 --> 00:38:56,699
Rym: But considering how long it took me to do this.

701
00:38:57,762 --> 00:38:58,530
Rym: S.R.A.,

702
00:38:58,773 --> 00:38:59,460
Rym: those are your answers.

703
00:38:59,601 --> 00:39:01,440
Rym: If you have any more questions, be sure to email us.

704
00:39:01,781 --> 00:39:03,479
Rym: We actually respond to emails sometimes.

705
00:39:05,243 --> 00:39:06,360
Scott: So the game Seasons.

706
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,540
Scott: So I heard about this game from people on the Internet.

707
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,706
Scott: So I bought it.

708
00:39:10,827 --> 00:39:12,340
Scott: It's a pretty new, hot, new game.

709
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:17,080
Scott: I wanted to talk about a hot new game on the show instead, you know, because you're running out of old games we've all played.

710
00:39:18,701 --> 00:39:20,420
Scott: So what is the deal with Seasons?

711
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:28,040
Scott: Well, the first thing that gets you in this game that you notice is the artworks, which are crazy, colorful and pretty cool.

712
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,080
Rym: I really like the evil.

713
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,340
Rym: Well, not evil, but the nervous looking rabbit wizard.

714
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,360
Rym: I've played him every time.

715
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:39,120
Scott: It's weird, like the character designs, like a lot of them, especially those main characters, like I'm not too into them.

716
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,007
Scott: Like I don't really like.

717
00:39:40,027 --> 00:39:46,040
Scott: I wouldn't, you know, want the weird, freaky bunny on my wall or anything, you know, but or as my desktop wallpaper.

718
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:57,740
Scott: But the style, like the way they're drawn and the bright colors and the high contrast and the high resolution, it's like the quality of it is like, oh, that is so nice.

719
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,867
Scott: It's just not.

720
00:39:58,907 --> 00:40:00,620
Scott: it's like a really nice drawing of a thing.

721
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:04,138
Scott: I don't want to see a drawing of, but it's fun.

722
00:40:04,178 --> 00:40:04,460
Rym: It's cute.

723
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:04,782
Scott: Yeah.

724
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:09,699
Scott: If you're someone who likes game artworks, this is this is like, you know, a territory here.

725
00:40:10,402 --> 00:40:20,839
Scott: The game itself, you know, when I read about it, the thing that made me want to buy it was how this was a confluence of so many different game mechanics that we already knew.

726
00:40:21,302 --> 00:40:23,980
Scott: Sort of mashed into one in an interesting way.

727
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,248
Scott: So here's how the game is.

728
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:26,679
Scott: The basic rundown, right?

729
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:34,420
Scott: First, you do a card draft like seven wonders where everyone has nine cards and you take one and you pass the rest to the left.

730
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,720
Scott: You take one and you pass to the left.

731
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:38,040
Scott: You take and eventually you're left with nine cards in front of you.

732
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,740
Rym: So you're constructing your deck based on an initial set.

733
00:40:40,841 --> 00:40:42,320
Rym: And this drives the entire game.

734
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,898
Rym: Everything beyond this deck construction is just moving the mice.

735
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:46,280
Scott: Right.

736
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:50,640
Scott: So you and everyone ends up with nine cards through a draft like seven wonders.

737
00:40:50,901 --> 00:40:57,080
Scott: And those, you know, however many people are playing, this is going to be nine times over the three player game.

738
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,127
Scott: They'll be twenty seven cards.

739
00:40:58,187 --> 00:41:00,060
Scott: The deck has a lot more than twenty seven cards.

740
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:07,680
Scott: So we actually we played it a few times now and we have probably not really experienced the depth of all the possible cards.

741
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,555
Rym: I, however, have won every game I've played and I've used.

742
00:41:11,575 --> 00:41:12,680
Rym: I use different strategies.

743
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:13,520
Rym: It just didn't matter.

744
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,860
Rym: Oh, we'll get to my opinion in a minute.

745
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,440
Scott: But I'm I'm still running down the game and you're jumping ahead.

746
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,580
Rym: I'm just saying I'm increasingly sour on the game.

747
00:41:20,621 --> 00:41:21,455
Rym: The more times I win it.

748
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,380
Scott: So anyway, you get these nine cards.

749
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,540
Scott: And here's the interesting part is you split them into three piles of three each.

750
00:41:28,942 --> 00:41:31,159
Scott: The first three cards are your starting hand.

751
00:41:31,641 --> 00:41:35,120
Scott: The second three are for part two and the third three are for part three.

752
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:44,840
Scott: So this is this beginning setup of the game forces you to create a long term plan where you say these are the cards I'm going to have in the second part of the game.

753
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,439
Scott: And these are the cards you have in the third part of the game.

754
00:41:47,243 --> 00:41:50,860
Scott: You know, you really have to long term think right from the get go.

755
00:41:51,362 --> 00:41:52,900
Scott: What are you going to do in this game?

756
00:41:53,463 --> 00:41:54,880
Scott: And you can look at those cards later.

757
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,779
Scott: You just can't pick them up until the time is right.

758
00:41:57,741 --> 00:42:05,300
Scott: So you really you know, a lot of games you just sort of get a starting hand and you make a decision based on what's going on on that turn.

759
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,932
Scott: And you don't really have to think too much about the future.

760
00:42:07,952 --> 00:42:10,325
Scott: or you maybe there's a game like chess.

761
00:42:10,365 --> 00:42:13,480
Scott: You have to look at the future, but you're looking at what's possible in the future.

762
00:42:14,043 --> 00:42:17,780
Scott: And this one, you already know a lot of the future, right?

763
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,740
Scott: Because you planned that future and now you have to make that happen.

764
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:30,240
Scott: So if you set up a bad future for yourself from the beginning, it's going to be very hard to make it happen no matter what you do now to to balance that up a good future.

765
00:42:30,801 --> 00:42:41,248
Scott: Then you still have to be able to make it happen, considering all the other things that other players in my opinion, the decisions as to what to put in one, two, three and also what cards to choose.

766
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,660
Scott: Relatively obvious, trivial.

767
00:42:43,042 --> 00:42:46,260
Scott: Yeah, it's not too hard mostly because there's not too many cards.

768
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:57,284
Rym: Now, more to the point, the real strategy, the game breaks down pretty quickly and that the real strategy is looking at the set of cards in the draft, anticipating what cards other players took,

769
00:42:57,686 --> 00:42:58,669
Scott: remembering them and

770
00:42:58,729 --> 00:43:04,178
Rym: will take and constructing your deck such that you will mitigate the cards they have.

771
00:43:04,641 --> 00:43:07,180
Rym: Know they're coming, know the order they're going to put them in a win.

772
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,280
Rym: The problem is that is a very high effort for relatively little return.

773
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:15,540
Rym: And I frankly don't bother with that and still win every time I play.

774
00:43:16,061 --> 00:43:17,700
Scott: So the next all two times you play.

775
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,580
Rym: Yeah, I won by so much both times.

776
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:25,380
Scott: So the next thing that happens is you start to play the actual game and it's what it does.

777
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:31,980
Scott: You have a rondel that goes around and it goes around the seasons of the year and just three years in the game.

778
00:43:32,081 --> 00:43:33,572
Scott: So the second year is the second part.

779
00:43:33,593 --> 00:43:34,500
Scott: in the third year is the third part.

780
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:39,200
Scott: So four seasons per year, three years per game, and each season has a set of dice.

781
00:43:39,461 --> 00:43:43,362
Scott: And what you do is you roll those dice, you know, so if you're in winter, you roll blue dice.

782
00:43:43,423 --> 00:43:45,519
Scott: If you're in summer, you roll yellow dice.

783
00:43:47,161 --> 00:43:49,580
Scott: Everyone complains about this in their right to complain about it.

784
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:52,199
Scott: The guy who made this game is the one thing he fucked up.

785
00:43:52,702 --> 00:43:54,699
Scott: He people confronted him on board game geek.

786
00:43:55,101 --> 00:43:55,903
Scott: He is wrong.

787
00:43:55,923 --> 00:44:03,566
Scott: Yes, he made summer and fire yellow and he made fall and autumn and air red.

788
00:44:04,595 --> 00:44:05,080
Scott: What the fuck?

789
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,299
Scott: Why is the fire not red?

790
00:44:06,581 --> 00:44:12,040
Rym: As a result, I refer to them purely as fires and feathers, and I ignore the colors.

791
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:13,159
Scott: I also ignore the colors.

792
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:20,047
Scott: But anyway, you roll the season dice associated with the season and then people each take one die.

793
00:44:20,107 --> 00:44:21,880
Scott: So it's sort of a Puerto Rico situation.

794
00:44:22,101 --> 00:44:22,900
Scott: I'll take the captain.

795
00:44:23,101 --> 00:44:29,840
Scott: I'll take the craftsman only instead of taking, you know, these cards that are always available every time you roll dice.

796
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,840
Scott: So the thing you want might not be available.

797
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:36,842
Scott: So everyone picks a die that came up on in different seasons, you're on different dice, too.

798
00:44:37,243 --> 00:44:40,900
Scott: So, you know, the thing you want might not be available that season at all.

799
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,279
Scott: And you got to get the game to go around.

800
00:44:42,621 --> 00:44:48,561
Rym: Now, this ends up already in terms of review being it really influences the game too much.

801
00:44:48,962 --> 00:44:55,245
Rym: Every both times I've played, I have had no more useful actions to take long before the end of the game.

802
00:44:55,346 --> 00:45:05,220
Rym: And the only chance I will have of being able to make a further decision of any kind is if there happens to come up the option to draw another card to then play.

803
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:08,579
Scott: Yeah, one of the die, some of the die will allow you to draw another card.

804
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:25,820
Scott: So, you know, if you've already used all your cards, which can happen if you play pretty well or if you picked a bunch of cards that were easy to play at the beginning, then you really need that draw more card thing to happen, because there's really not much you can do in the game to score points besides transmute other than play cards.

805
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,480
Scott: It's really all about getting resources to be able to play the cards.

806
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:35,902
Scott: You roll dice and you need summoning, you need stars, you need all these different elements.

807
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:41,439
Scott: You basically need to collect resources from dice and other things in order to be able to put cards on the table.

808
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:50,780
Scott: And then what the cards do is sort of the whole game and as getting you victory points either in the forms of the cards themselves or crystals are also worth points.

809
00:45:52,263 --> 00:45:54,199
Scott: And you basically go around three times doing this.

810
00:45:54,621 --> 00:45:59,792
Rym: I found that cards worth a lot of victory points are way more useful than cards that do fucking anything.

811
00:46:00,136 --> 00:46:00,400
Scott: Yeah.

812
00:46:00,921 --> 00:46:05,744
Rym: And whoever gets the gauntlet that gives you a one discount and everything is pretty much guaranteed to win.

813
00:46:05,764 --> 00:46:10,940
Scott: That card is ridiculously powerful because it basically makes everything easier to every card easier to play.

814
00:46:11,081 --> 00:46:15,020
Scott: And being able to play all your cards is pretty much the hard thing to do in the game.

815
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,479
Scott: That's that's what you have to do to win.

816
00:46:16,921 --> 00:46:21,302
Scott: So and you lose at the end of the game negative five points for every card you didn't play.

817
00:46:21,343 --> 00:46:23,480
Scott: And you've got nine cards minimum to play.

818
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:31,927
Scott: Now, what's interesting is the people may make you forced you to draw more, which for me is great because I play them immediately if you've got the freaking glove, which I always do.

819
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:32,880
Scott: You've had twice.

820
00:46:33,061 --> 00:46:33,342
Scott: Right.

821
00:46:33,362 --> 00:46:46,154
Rym: So the thing is that this is where the game is interesting because it breaks a few of the sort of standard assumptions of games and standard limitations, especially of card games, kind of like how Dominion got rid of the.

822
00:46:46,315 --> 00:46:51,520
Rym: I have a hand of cards and I kind of play one card at a time or, you know, I have a limited number of actions.

823
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:54,179
Rym: Dominion, you play your whole fucking hand every turn.

824
00:46:54,441 --> 00:46:54,622
Scott: Yeah.

825
00:46:54,884 --> 00:46:57,040
Rym: And when I first played Dominion, that was a big deal.

826
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:59,432
Rym: That was like that was like doing something.

827
00:46:59,452 --> 00:47:00,900
Scott: first played him in your enemy, Boston.

828
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:01,948
Scott: We were like, fuck this shit.

829
00:47:02,008 --> 00:47:03,239
Scott: The second time you played Dominion.

830
00:47:03,441 --> 00:47:03,683
Rym: Yeah.

831
00:47:03,926 --> 00:47:05,440
Rym: But it was like this forbidden thing.

832
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:05,701
Rym: It was.

833
00:47:05,942 --> 00:47:12,920
Rym: it was refreshing because there's always the thing you want to do in games that games never let you do because the mechanics tend to break down.

834
00:47:13,483 --> 00:47:14,920
Rym: This game does that in this sense.

835
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:18,814
Rym: You can play as many goddamn cards as you can possibly spend mana on.

836
00:47:19,517 --> 00:47:20,360
Rym: or energy tokens?

837
00:47:21,281 --> 00:47:21,545
Scott: Yeah.

838
00:47:21,646 --> 00:47:22,580
Scott: It's the vocabulary.

839
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:23,607
Scott: This game is a little weird.

840
00:47:23,849 --> 00:47:25,140
Scott: Crystals, energy tokens.

841
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:25,701
Rym: Yeah.

842
00:47:25,721 --> 00:47:27,900
Rym: And some of them are gauges, but some of them are meters.

843
00:47:28,461 --> 00:47:34,139
Scott: By the way, the story of this game is that you're a bunch of wizards and you're all competing to see who's going to become the archmage.

844
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:35,341
Scott: Ooh.

845
00:47:36,047 --> 00:47:37,620
Scott: And it's a three year wizard's duel.

846
00:47:40,284 --> 00:47:41,739
Rym: Good thing Kvothe didn't show up.

847
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:42,444
Scott: That's another thing.

848
00:47:42,464 --> 00:47:44,720
Scott: There's two different kinds of cards is purple and orange.

849
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,139
Scott: Purple cards are magic items.

850
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:48,920
Scott: So when you play those, they're generally just boosts to you.

851
00:47:49,021 --> 00:47:50,797
Scott: Those are the cards you really want to play a lot of.

852
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:58,420
Scott: But there's also these orange cards which are all familiars and they all have creature themes, you know, that's like so and so the destroyer or whatever.

853
00:47:59,021 --> 00:48:07,480
Scott: All of those cards sort of damage everybody else at the table and they usually damage everybody else to the table relatively equally.

854
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:10,620
Scott: So you can't sort of target the guy in the lead to do any king making.

855
00:48:11,081 --> 00:48:15,284
Scott: If you want to fuck people over, you fuck over everyone but yourself with the orange familiar card.

856
00:48:15,384 --> 00:48:19,800
Rym: So the game has no direct fucking, as we call it, or as Richard Garfield calls it, politics.

857
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:23,140
Scott: Yes, but it does have that sort of interaction.

858
00:48:23,521 --> 00:48:23,742
Scott: Right.

859
00:48:23,762 --> 00:48:26,540
Scott: So, I mean, you saw most of the cards during the draft.

860
00:48:26,861 --> 00:48:29,900
Scott: Not all of them, obviously, but most of them, whether you took them or not.

861
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,340
Scott: So you know that someone has, you know, whatever card you passed to the left.

862
00:48:34,982 --> 00:48:39,852
Scott: So you know that, you know, that's going to come around at some point, like the air elemental, which no one.

863
00:48:40,013 --> 00:48:41,040
Rym: it was the end of the game.

864
00:48:41,202 --> 00:48:43,059
Rym: I only had a couple of cards left in my hand.

865
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:45,199
Rym: None of you expected me to do that.

866
00:48:45,482 --> 00:48:47,100
Scott: I knew the air elemental was coming eventually.

867
00:48:47,782 --> 00:48:49,179
Scott: It just came in a really bad time.

868
00:48:49,401 --> 00:48:50,658
Rym: I didn't even care about the attack.

869
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,720
Rym: I only played it because it's worth a bunch of victory points.

870
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:53,422
Scott: Exactly.

871
00:48:53,442 --> 00:48:55,040
Rym: My strategy to win this game is simple.

872
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:59,680
Rym: I get cards that help me play more cards or that are worth a bunch of victory points.

873
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:00,658
Scott: And are easy to play.

874
00:49:01,721 --> 00:49:03,580
Rym: And otherwise, I just move my mice.

875
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:04,321
Scott: Yep.

876
00:49:05,085 --> 00:49:07,680
Scott: There really isn't too much to think about.

877
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:15,495
Rym: Well, no, there are things you can do to... You can spend a lot of mental effort that is not terribly fun.

878
00:49:15,515 --> 00:49:16,640
Rym: to have a slight edge.

879
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:23,805
Rym: For example, Scott played a card, fuck you, that went around the table for the whole rest of the game.

880
00:49:24,006 --> 00:49:28,462
Scott: When I played at Nerd NYC, two of those went around the table at the same time.

881
00:49:29,305 --> 00:49:38,300
Rym: The problem is that card is only effective if you count out the modulus math of when it's going to hit different people and what resources will be available.

882
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:41,540
Scott: Usually it hits anyone who, A, doesn't have water, right?

883
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:47,084
Scott: So you can play it after everyone has used their water or there won't be water for another couple of seasons.

884
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:54,980
Scott: Or B, it hits the first player, because even if the first player has water, when it'll get to them, their turn is already passed.

885
00:49:55,322 --> 00:49:59,509
Scott: So they can't do anything to get rid of it again because they've already done their stuff this turn.

886
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:00,139
Scott: So they get hit.

887
00:50:00,522 --> 00:50:02,760
Scott: They pass it to the left the next turn with their water.

888
00:50:03,321 --> 00:50:07,120
Scott: And then the next player to the left of them is obviously the new first player.

889
00:50:07,464 --> 00:50:08,699
Scott: So they're stuck with it now.

890
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,082
Rym: So you could count it out and figure out and plan and make that card be fairly effective.

891
00:50:13,684 --> 00:50:23,859
Rym: But for example, Phil passed it to me and then a card came out that we were forced to give up, you know, take back a discard or sacrifice a card we had out.

892
00:50:24,543 --> 00:50:27,199
Rym: So I sacrificed the fucking monster and kept all my real cards.

893
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:27,602
Scott: Yeah.

894
00:50:28,385 --> 00:50:31,480
Scott: So in a way, that card to be beneficial, it's also a very beneficial card.

895
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:38,060
Rym: There is no way to plan on that beneficial effect unless you spend an unreasonable amount of unfun brain effort.

896
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:38,361
Scott: Yeah.

897
00:50:38,462 --> 00:50:40,140
Scott: It's also that card.

898
00:50:40,361 --> 00:50:54,664
Scott: Just to add to it, right, if you're the person who plays the card, not only can you easily immediately pass it off at the beginning, but it gives you a huge bonus when you immediately play it in the form of I think it might put your summoning gauge up one, but I know it gives you 10 crystals.

899
00:50:54,744 --> 00:50:59,144
Scott: So it's not a bad if you just play it, it's already helping you and hurting everyone else.

900
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:02,221
Rym: Yeah, except it's almost guaranteed to come around and hurt you very soon.

901
00:51:02,262 --> 00:51:05,340
Scott: Even if it comes around and hurts you, you're still better off than everyone else.

902
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:12,953
Rym: The other thing that makes the game interesting, but kind of bad, is that you have crystals are victory points and you can spend crystals to do stuff.

903
00:51:13,274 --> 00:51:17,074
Rym: And a lot of attacks remove crystals from you so you can remove victory points from other.

904
00:51:17,094 --> 00:51:18,562
Scott: people will take crystals from you.

905
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:29,140
Rym: The problem is I tend to play decks where, well, strategies, and it seems very effective where I hover around zero and these attacks don't hurt me at all.

906
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:38,438
Rym: So basically at every round, there was a thing happening where everyone's losing four victory points, except me, because I had zero victory points on the board.

907
00:51:38,518 --> 00:51:40,124
Rym: My victory points were all in cards.

908
00:51:40,244 --> 00:51:48,032
Rym: As a result, I was effectively gaining four victory points on everyone except the person doing that action every round.

909
00:51:48,072 --> 00:51:57,094
Scott: Yeah, there are very few cards that and I think there's actually a problem with the cards, at least when I've played, there are very few cards that attack the cards of other players.

910
00:51:57,255 --> 00:51:57,516
Scott: Right.

911
00:51:57,737 --> 00:52:01,598
Rym: And when they do, they're always like everyone picks a card to take back into their hand.

912
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:03,205
Scott: There's no counter spells.

913
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:08,186
Scott: There's no randomly, you know, I mean, the worst thing that you can do is make everyone draw.

914
00:52:08,206 --> 00:52:12,123
Scott: And it only hurts people who are having a hard time playing who are already losing.

915
00:52:12,163 --> 00:52:15,457
Scott: If somebody is winning, drawing a card for them is great.

916
00:52:15,577 --> 00:52:17,645
Scott: So it's like it's not necessarily a negative.

917
00:52:17,686 --> 00:52:17,886
Scott: There's.

918
00:52:17,927 --> 00:52:19,553
Scott: no you know, there's nothing.

919
00:52:19,573 --> 00:52:25,876
Scott: that's like you choose a card from everyone else's pile or everyone must sacrifice a card.

920
00:52:25,896 --> 00:52:31,243
Scott: That is, you know, there's some cards that are negative, like the one we just talked about that are negative victory points.

921
00:52:31,283 --> 00:52:35,602
Scott: So forcing everyone to sacrifice a card could be good or bad for opponents.

922
00:52:35,643 --> 00:52:38,940
Scott: There is no universal way that I found there might be one I haven't seen.

923
00:52:39,502 --> 00:52:44,719
Scott: that hurts everyone other than you in the cards as opposed to in the crystals.

924
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:50,358
Rym: Now, my real kind of core problem with the game is just that you have so few options.

925
00:52:50,539 --> 00:52:59,391
Rym: It is likely as in I'd say there's about a 30 percent chance on any given time it is your turn, that there is literally no action you can take and you just pass.

926
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:05,177
Rym: I pass easily a third of the turns I take in this game because there's just nothing you can do.

927
00:53:05,498 --> 00:53:06,383
Rym: You take some crystals.

928
00:53:06,685 --> 00:53:08,233
Rym: You don't have the little transmute icons.

929
00:53:08,253 --> 00:53:12,352
Scott: You can't do that and you don't want to use your superpower because you lose victory points.

930
00:53:12,472 --> 00:53:14,703
Scott: You don't have your summoning gauges at max.

931
00:53:14,743 --> 00:53:15,788
Scott: You can't play any cards.

932
00:53:15,909 --> 00:53:18,079
Scott: So you take your energy tokens and your turns over.

933
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:18,823
Rym: Just fucking sit there.

934
00:53:18,843 --> 00:53:23,206
Rym: A lot of times I have no cards in my hand, but at least it makes the game go around quickly.

935
00:53:23,287 --> 00:53:23,930
Rym: No, it doesn't.

936
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:25,479
Rym: People take for fucking ever on their turn.

937
00:53:25,499 --> 00:53:26,424
Scott: Well, that's the thing, right?

938
00:53:26,484 --> 00:53:36,092
Scott: Is that on the one hand, it's quick to decide what to do on your turn, but it's slow because you eventually have a lot of cards in front of you and everyone has cards in front of them that are always doing stuff like.

939
00:53:36,394 --> 00:53:38,263
Scott: this card does this whenever this happens.

940
00:53:38,323 --> 00:53:42,542
Scott: So even though you quickly decided on my turn, I'm going to take two forests and pass.

941
00:53:42,562 --> 00:53:42,984
Scott: That's it.

942
00:53:43,507 --> 00:53:44,732
Scott: Someone else is like, wait a minute.

943
00:53:44,933 --> 00:53:47,888
Scott: When this happens, this card does this and this card does that.

944
00:53:47,928 --> 00:53:48,753
Scott: And that ends up being.

945
00:53:48,773 --> 00:53:53,594
Scott: where all the time gets taken up is all this management and remembering of cards that do things.

946
00:53:53,754 --> 00:54:09,070
Rym: So while the game is relatively simple and should be relatively quick to play, it does have interesting mechanics that other games do not have and has a light strategic depth because complex strategy is difficult to enact and not terribly fun to enact.

947
00:54:09,852 --> 00:54:22,986
Rym: The problem is the nature of this game with all the proper noun cards with tons of text on them and different effects means that the majority of the people you would ever play this game with will take for fucking ever on their turn.

948
00:54:23,187 --> 00:54:26,380
Rym: You cannot play this with people who take time on their turn.

949
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:33,015
Scott: I played it at Nerd NYC and it took longer than any game I've ever played at Nerd NYC and the one other smart guy I was playing with said the same thing.

950
00:54:33,055 --> 00:54:36,229
Scott: And we were playing with the two other people just like didn't really get it.

951
00:54:36,249 --> 00:54:38,498
Scott: And the game took so long.

952
00:54:38,518 --> 00:54:40,225
Scott: It says on the box one hour.

953
00:54:40,245 --> 00:54:42,232
Scott: It is a one hour game.

954
00:54:42,252 --> 00:54:49,155
Scott: They really only play tested this, I think, with people who knew how to fucking play card games like CCGs and things.

955
00:54:49,556 --> 00:54:51,985
Rym: Well, here's what I think is going on.

956
00:54:52,487 --> 00:54:57,428
Rym: The people who take too long on their turn, it's a fairly simple problem that it's not specific to this game.

957
00:54:57,488 --> 00:54:58,151
Rym: It's universal.

958
00:54:58,893 --> 00:55:12,117
Rym: In my experience, anyone who takes a long time on their turn in board games typically does not have the sort of generic aptitude for discarding clearly bad decisions or clearly bad choices.

959
00:55:12,418 --> 00:55:21,051
Rym: They have very poor, to use a Garfield term, they have personally very poor directional heuristics and he's end up computing all the different possibilities.

960
00:55:21,071 --> 00:55:21,353
Scott: Exactly.

961
00:55:21,373 --> 00:55:25,853
Scott: Because he said a beginner in a game is very likely to not notice a lot of the options.

962
00:55:25,893 --> 00:55:27,802
Scott: They'll only know about a few things they can do.

963
00:55:27,822 --> 00:55:32,562
Scott: So their turn is quick because they only can see three ways to go and they pick one of them.

964
00:55:33,004 --> 00:55:39,595
Scott: A really advanced player can see all the different ways to go, but knows that 90 percent of the ways to go are completely meaningless.

965
00:55:39,695 --> 00:55:43,352
Scott: So also has pretty much like a two or three choices and picks one quickly.

966
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:46,146
Rym: Like in chess, I know not to start with the Polish Open.

967
00:55:46,206 --> 00:55:46,407
Scott: Right.

968
00:55:46,568 --> 00:55:47,231
Rym: As much as I like.

969
00:55:47,251 --> 00:55:48,960
Scott: It's the intermediate players.

970
00:55:49,201 --> 00:55:55,303
Scott: They can see all the choices, but they don't know that most of those choices are completely stupid and useless.

971
00:55:55,343 --> 00:56:03,437
Scott: They're considering each and every one, even though they're not able to just quickly and swiftly say, yeah, none of those are good ideas.

972
00:56:03,477 --> 00:56:04,603
Scott: There's really only two good ones.

973
00:56:05,025 --> 00:56:06,614
Scott: So they take for fucking ever.

974
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:09,226
Scott: And that's the kind of person you're going to find at board game night.

975
00:56:09,286 --> 00:56:20,213
Rym: Now, it's funny because if you go to a convention like packs, there's fewer of those people because most of the people in tabletop are either before that point in their board gaming career or after that point.

976
00:56:20,534 --> 00:56:27,335
Rym: It's like that point only exists in quantity in like local board gaming groups that meet up somewhere.

977
00:56:28,117 --> 00:56:38,486
Rym: But it's an intractable problem, which is why this game fails in the sense that the strategy level is perfect for people at that level.

978
00:56:38,908 --> 00:56:46,862
Rym: But because of all the text and all the fiddliness, those are the people who take the longest on their turns, thus making it an unbearable game to play.

979
00:56:47,023 --> 00:56:49,516
Scott: I think this game could do well, right.

980
00:56:49,777 --> 00:56:55,461
Scott: If they were, you know, they sort of changed it up a little bit, you know, mathematically, right.

981
00:56:55,501 --> 00:57:01,322
Scott: Like if you had more cards, if there were if there were different cards of more variety.

982
00:57:01,422 --> 00:57:01,703
Scott: Right.

983
00:57:02,385 --> 00:57:19,708
Scott: And if, you know, you didn't you weren't penalized so heavily for not playing every single freaking card, you know, then the game would be more dynamic as you went around, as opposed to just sort of after you plan the game, it's a race to play all your cards and whatever they do, they do.

984
00:57:19,789 --> 00:57:23,605
Scott: And also the drafting thing at the beginning, I want to experiment with this.

985
00:57:23,625 --> 00:57:27,340
Scott: It's everyone draws nine and everyone ends with nine.

986
00:57:27,701 --> 00:57:31,820
Scott: Why not draw fifteen and end with nine?

987
00:57:32,202 --> 00:57:33,511
Rym: Sure, you'll get more powerful.

988
00:57:33,854 --> 00:57:34,660
Rym: Everyone will.

989
00:57:35,162 --> 00:57:37,199
Rym: Maybe it'll be a Dune situation then.

990
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:37,840
Scott: Yeah.

991
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:44,782
Scott: Or why not do something like, you know, you know, everyone gets, you know, you know, twelve.

992
00:57:45,264 --> 00:57:50,727
Scott: And, you know, you can either take one and put it in front of you or you can take one and throw it out of the game.

993
00:57:50,747 --> 00:57:51,973
Scott: or, you know, you can make.

994
00:57:52,013 --> 00:57:56,937
Scott: if you mix up that draft at the beginning, then I think people would end up with a lot more interesting.

995
00:57:56,977 --> 00:58:05,220
Scott: or maybe like everyone draws, you know, some number of cards, you give one to yourself and you give one to someone else to start with and then and then you pass.

996
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:12,040
Scott: I think a lot of things we mixed up in that draft phase such that, you know, and then so someone gave you a card during the draft.

997
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:16,060
Rym: You look because the draft phase is basically 80 percent of the game.

998
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:16,301
Scott: Right.

999
00:58:16,321 --> 00:58:24,624
Scott: So now if you mix up that draft phase a little bit and you had different cards or more of them or whatever, someone gives you a card during the draft, it's going to be in your hand.

1000
00:58:24,987 --> 00:58:26,360
Scott: You've got to play it during the game.

1001
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:31,060
Scott: So now when you get the next set to pick from, you see a really awesome card in there.

1002
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:38,880
Scott: You would have picked otherwise, but now you've got to pick a different one because it'll help you deal with the shitty card someone else gave you that you're stuck with.

1003
00:58:39,361 --> 00:58:44,042
Scott: So and then you end up handing that other really good card to the next guy and so on and so forth.

1004
00:58:44,323 --> 00:58:48,662
Rym: So I think if I had to recommend this game, I would actually recommend you not buy it.

1005
00:58:48,902 --> 00:58:59,011
Rym: Yeah, I say you I say generically because if you're the kind of people I would recommend this game to, like I said, are the people who, you know, the sort of novice board gamers, it's like a light game.

1006
00:58:59,032 --> 00:59:00,200
Rym: you can play relatively quickly.

1007
00:59:00,921 --> 00:59:05,779
Rym: But odds are you're going to end up playing with people who will take so long on their turns that you will hate this game.

1008
00:59:06,462 --> 00:59:15,527
Rym: And if you're an advanced board gamer, the only time you should buy this game is if you are bored and you've played every game you already own to death and you're looking for something novel.

1009
00:59:15,547 --> 00:59:16,940
Rym: That's really.

1010
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:28,580
Scott: Yeah, that's really the biggest benefit of this game is the artwork and the novelty of this combination of mechanics that, you know, are some of which are in other games, but really aren't all together in one place.

1011
00:59:29,081 --> 00:59:30,809
Scott: And you will learn something by playing it.

1012
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:33,742
Scott: if you're big into games, which we did learn something from it.

1013
00:59:34,244 --> 00:59:35,870
Scott: Things the other.

1014
00:59:35,971 --> 00:59:43,600
Scott: one more thing I say about this game is that the the boxing of this game is the most wasted space of any game ever.

1015
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:51,795
Scott: It's like a deck of cards, a bag of chips and a few boards, and it's in a giant full sized box that has got to be at least 80, 90 percent air.

1016
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:53,361
Scott: Right.

1017
00:59:53,722 --> 00:59:58,880
Scott: This needs a reboxing so hard, harder than any game I've ever owned.

1018
01:00:00,783 --> 01:00:06,298
Scott: So if you're the kind of person who wants a game that doesn't take up a lot of space, this is a good game to get because you can rebox it.

1019
01:00:07,161 --> 01:00:12,440
Scott: But if you keep the original box, man, this game is going to eat up your whole freaking shelf for no reason at all.

1020
01:00:13,083 --> 01:00:13,649
Scott: And I hate that.

1021
01:00:13,669 --> 01:00:14,599
Scott: And I wish people would stop that.

1022
01:00:14,921 --> 01:00:24,548
Rym: So, yeah, and as a result, there are so few people I can recommend this game for that I actually, despite relatively enjoying it, have to say that I would not recommend anyone by this game.

1023
01:00:24,688 --> 01:00:26,640
Scott: I'm trying to think of any group to recommend it to.

1024
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:30,119
Scott: And the only one I can think of right is if you are someone who or delete this.

1025
01:00:30,521 --> 01:00:30,761
Scott: No.

1026
01:00:31,163 --> 01:00:37,023
Scott: If you are somebody who wants to sort of move over into the European board gaming situation.

1027
01:00:37,104 --> 01:00:37,265
Scott: Right.

1028
01:00:37,285 --> 01:00:45,800
Scott: And you want to learn some of these mechanics like action taking and but you come from a CCG kind of background like that.

1029
01:00:47,603 --> 01:00:47,984
Rym: Right.

1030
01:00:48,004 --> 01:01:00,403
Scott: Then where you're going, if you take back my right, if you're a CCG person, this could be a transition game into the euro board gaming world because it has both aspects combined.

1031
01:01:00,644 --> 01:01:05,264
Rym: But what I would say to you there is harden the fuck up and just play El Grande.

1032
01:01:05,284 --> 01:01:06,219
Scott: Of course, of course.

1033
01:01:06,381 --> 01:01:09,000
Scott: But, you know, that at least, you know, what other game does that really?

1034
01:01:09,923 --> 01:01:11,960
Rym: Yeah, that's that's the only thing I could recommend it to.

1035
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:13,140
Scott: I mean, I'd grickle a little bit.

1036
01:01:13,621 --> 01:01:18,640
Rym: Either that or if you're a bored elitist in board games like us.

1037
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:23,620
Scott: If anyone wants a copy of Seasons, I'm likely only to play it a few more times.

1038
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,080
Rym: If I'm going to make another recommendation, this is a good game.

1039
01:01:26,662 --> 01:01:36,201
Rym: If you are someone who really enjoys German board games or board games in general, have played a lot of them, have started to understand them and want to design your own games.

1040
01:01:36,843 --> 01:01:47,620
Rym: Use this game to see some mechanics that don't really work that well and kind of follow through a game and try to identify like where it fails and see if you can come up with ways to fix it.

1041
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:53,199
Scott: It's a game that is, you know, it has problems, but it's not one of those games that's like, oh, so obviously broken.

1042
01:01:53,481 --> 01:01:53,682
Scott: Right.

1043
01:01:53,702 --> 01:01:57,640
Rym: Like Mario Kart or or what was that board game we had with the Greek guys?

1044
01:01:58,560 --> 01:01:59,919
Scott: Well, that was just poorly written rules.

1045
01:02:00,061 --> 01:02:01,520
Scott: Yeah, that wasn't I think that game.

1046
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,679
Scott: If you if you figured out the rules, actually not so bad.

1047
01:02:04,941 --> 01:02:05,282
Scott: Whatever.

1048
01:02:05,884 --> 01:02:10,760
Scott: But Helis, Helis, but this game is a game that's like just slightly problematic.

1049
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:19,420
Scott: So if you really want to learn a lot about game design and a lot of the pros and cons of all the different mechanics it uses, they're all only slightly broken.

1050
01:02:19,561 --> 01:02:23,520
Scott: And only someone who's really learned a lot about games will be able to see the flaws in this.

1051
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:28,820
Scott: I think a lot of people will play this game and who aren't like us and will think it's kind of pretty great.

1052
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:29,484
Rym: And I can.

1053
01:02:29,706 --> 01:02:30,695
Scott: I can anticipate it at all.

1054
01:02:31,642 --> 01:02:38,820
Rym: I had the entire discussion I would have with certain unnamed people about this game where they would tell me that, one, I haven't solved the game, that I'm not.

1055
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,199
Rym: I'm giving it a shot.

1056
01:02:40,481 --> 01:02:44,420
Rym: I solved it in the sense that I'm giving it a short shrift.

1057
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:48,402
Rym: And they would say that it's much more strategically complex than I give it credit for.

1058
01:02:49,006 --> 01:02:51,020
Scott: Maybe if you added a fistful of extra cards.

1059
01:02:51,281 --> 01:02:52,228
Rym: Well, there is depth there.

1060
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:53,560
Rym: The problem is it's dota depth.

1061
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:59,761
Rym: It's it's depth that is not enjoyable to explore, nor is it analogous to the game itself.

1062
01:03:05,287 --> 01:03:07,430
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1063
01:03:07,630 --> 01:03:12,734
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1064
01:03:12,935 --> 01:03:17,969
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

1065
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:25,630
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows, SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1067
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:33,490
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1068
01:03:33,691 --> 01:03:36,609
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
