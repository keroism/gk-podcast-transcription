1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,669
Rym: It's Wednesday, April 25th, 2012.

2
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:09,850
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,202 --> 00:00:12,800
Rym: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,225
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,265 --> 00:00:18,040
Rym: Tonight, Lupin the Third, the woman called Fujiko Mine.

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,899
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,081 --> 00:00:29,800
Scott: So I got this paper in the mail the other day.

8
00:00:30,082 --> 00:00:30,223
Scott: Uh-oh.

9
00:00:30,385 --> 00:00:31,540
Rym: Mail is never good news.

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,788
Scott: I rarely get mail.

11
00:00:32,848 --> 00:00:34,720
Scott: I actually have eliminated all junk mail.

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,540
Scott: And just to tell you the strategy of eliminating all junk mail, right?

13
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,059
Scott: This is the strategy, number one.

14
00:00:39,761 --> 00:00:40,527
Scott: There's a website.

15
00:00:40,547 --> 00:00:42,060
Scott: There's only one legitimate website.

16
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:45,700
Scott: It's hard to tell it's legitimate because it doesn't look legitimate, but it's a real website.

17
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:47,480
Scott: It's called Opt Out Prescreen.

18
00:00:48,262 --> 00:00:50,677
Scott: And if you go to this website, it's legitimate.

19
00:00:50,738 --> 00:00:51,060
Scott: It works.

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,009
Scott: There's only one that works.

21
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:52,898
Scott: Make sure you get the right one.

22
00:00:53,604 --> 00:00:54,398
Scott: Because it's fake ones.

23
00:00:55,242 --> 00:00:57,920
Scott: You can opt out of all credit prescreen.

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:06,520
Scott: So no one out there can, like, prescreen your credit score to determine if they're going to mail you junk mail for bullshit like student loan consolidation.

25
00:01:07,161 --> 00:01:12,260
Scott: After going to that website, before going to the website, I used to get, like, letters constantly.

26
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,348
Scott: Like, "Get a credit card.

27
00:01:13,408 --> 00:01:14,275
Scott: Get a this, get a that, get a

28
00:01:14,296 --> 00:01:14,437
Scott: this.".

29
00:01:14,981 --> 00:01:15,202
Scott: Right?

30
00:01:15,402 --> 00:01:19,520
Scott: And as soon as I went to that website, within, like, a week, I haven't gotten any of that bullshit mail since.

31
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,130
Scott: Number two, right?

32
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,886
Scott: Whenever you do get a mail, for example, if you go to buy something in EMS with a credit card, they got you.

33
00:01:28,128 --> 00:01:29,680
Scott: Or Bed, Bath, and Beyond, they got you.

34
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,639
Scott: And they start sending you coupons and shit in the mail.

35
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,780
Scott: Specifically, go to each one of those places and say, "EMS, stop sending me shit.

36
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,998
Scott: Bed, Bath, and Beyond, stop sending me

37
00:01:39,038 --> 00:01:39,159
Scott: shit.".

38
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,258
Scott: And they'll stop sending you shit.

39
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:47,780
Scott: And because of that, and also what I do, is every place I have a bill pay, I sort of, I choose the paperless option.

40
00:01:48,423 --> 00:01:49,340
Rym: As well one should.

41
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:50,819
Scott: So it's internet only.

42
00:01:51,922 --> 00:01:54,739
Scott: So I hardly ever get anything in the mail except, like, tax forms.

43
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,620
Scott: And Netflix.

44
00:01:57,542 --> 00:01:58,093
Scott: And that's it.

45
00:01:58,521 --> 00:02:00,553
Scott: So, uh, I got something in the mail.

46
00:02:00,574 --> 00:02:00,835
Scott: I was like,

47
00:02:00,876 --> 00:02:01,278
Scott: "Whoa.".

48
00:02:01,741 --> 00:02:03,733
Scott: And it wasn't just bullshit, so I was like,

49
00:02:03,774 --> 00:02:04,176
Scott: "Whoa.".

50
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:06,167
Scott: It was a student loan bill.

51
00:02:06,207 --> 00:02:07,032
Scott: And I was like, "Wait a minute.

52
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:08,499
Scott: That shit's auto-pay, yo.

53
00:02:09,122 --> 00:02:09,675
Scott: And what's up with

54
00:02:09,717 --> 00:02:09,820
Scott: this?".

55
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,459
Rym: Student loan?

56
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:13,232
Scott: So I'm like, "Do I have to pay this?

57
00:02:13,513 --> 00:02:14,016
Scott: Or is it gonna

58
00:02:14,117 --> 00:02:14,619
Scott: auto-pay?".

59
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:20,920
Scott: 'Cause apparently what happened is the government used to, like, direct federal, direct loan, whatever, used to be, like, the thing.

60
00:02:21,521 --> 00:02:29,380
Scott: But what they did is they found these other people, like Ed Financial, and now Ed Financial is managing the loans even though the loans are unchanged.

61
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,580
Scott: So they, like, changed the management company.

62
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:32,498
Rym: Fascinating.

63
00:02:32,801 --> 00:02:33,519
Scott: And the website, yeah.

64
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,636
Scott: So anyway, so, uh, I, you know, I'm like, "Do I have to pay this?

65
00:02:38,756 --> 00:02:39,619
Scott: Or is auto-pay still

66
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:39,860
Scott: working?".

67
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,379
Scott: So I called up Ed Financial and I was like, "Hey, uh, do I have to pay

68
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:44,540
Scott: this?".

69
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,765
Scott: They're like, "No, auto-pay will still

70
00:02:45,786 --> 00:02:45,986
Scott: work.".

71
00:02:46,027 --> 00:02:46,790
Scott: I'm like, "Oh, okay.

72
00:02:47,252 --> 00:02:48,599
Scott: How do I make you stop mailing me

73
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:48,860
Scott: shit?".

74
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:50,085
Scott: And they're like, "Go to the

75
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:50,306
Scott: web.".

76
00:02:50,347 --> 00:02:53,019
Scott: I'm like, "Are you gonna mail me something every time even though auto-pay is

77
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,160
Scott: on?".

78
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,918
Scott: And they're like, "Yeah, you have to go to the website to cancel

79
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:55,079
Scott: that.".

80
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:55,428
Scott: I'm like, "Oh,

81
00:02:55,448 --> 00:02:55,715
Scott: great.".

82
00:02:56,362 --> 00:02:57,367
Scott: And then I was like, "Wait a minute.

83
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,738
Scott: How much student loan do I have

84
00:02:59,798 --> 00:03:00,059
Scott: left?".

85
00:03:00,662 --> 00:03:03,034
Scott: And they were like, "Oh, a little less than

86
00:03:03,034 --> 00:03:04,522
Scott: $9,000.".

87
00:03:04,522 --> 00:03:04,967
Scott: And I'm like,

88
00:03:05,007 --> 00:03:05,149
Scott: "Hmmm.".

89
00:03:06,861 --> 00:03:07,850
Scott: So I paid that shit.

90
00:03:08,456 --> 00:03:08,860
Scott: Boom.

91
00:03:09,782 --> 00:03:10,209
Scott: That's it.

92
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:10,780
Scott: It's gone.

93
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,227
Scott: 'Cause it was two- one-.

94
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:13,259
Scott: think about it this way, right?

95
00:03:13,921 --> 00:03:16,188
Scott: I was paying, like, $214 a month and the interest rate was, like, 2.11 percent.

96
00:03:20,483 --> 00:03:21,991
Scott: That's, like, guaranteed 2.11 percent no tax.

97
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:29,214
Scott: So by paying that off, that's like investing $9,000 and getting a 2.11 percent return.

98
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:37,200
Scott: And there's no way I could do that guaranteed in this environment, right?

99
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,268
Scott: I mean, a savings account's gonna give you, like, 0.00000 percent.

100
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,000
Rym: Yeah, that's pretty much the exact right move to make in your situation at this time.

101
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,598
Scott: So now, it's like I got a raise, even though my bank account went...

102
00:03:49,221 --> 00:03:52,679
Rym: Unless the opportunity cost of that money was more...

103
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,060
Scott: It was gonna sit in my checking account.

104
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,577
Rym: Oh, there you go.

105
00:03:55,461 --> 00:03:59,930
Scott: But it's like, so now, it's like my checking account went... But I got a raise of, like, $200 a month.

106
00:04:02,668 --> 00:04:03,075
Rym: It was a big deal.

107
00:04:03,961 --> 00:04:08,640
Rym: When I paid off my student loan some years ago, the last one, like, I didn't really think about it 'cause they'd just been auto-paying forever.

108
00:04:09,501 --> 00:04:15,160
Rym: And then, you know, I got my first paychecks, like, for the two months after that and then I had this extra money and I was like, "Wait a minute.

109
00:04:16,262 --> 00:04:19,317
Rym: I could just spend all this extra money, not change

110
00:04:19,397 --> 00:04:19,719
Rym: anything.".

111
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:21,420
Scott: $200 a month is actually a lot.

112
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,200
Scott: Like, I can get Zipcar and profit or, you know, who knows what.

113
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,697
Rym: Well, not technically profit, but anyway.

114
00:04:27,502 --> 00:04:30,640
Scott: I'm just saying, I'm not gonna do any of that, but it's just like, yeah.

115
00:04:31,902 --> 00:04:35,000
Scott: And now, I'm also debt-free, which means I can run away at any fucking time.

116
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:36,335
Rym: I've been debt-free for many years.

117
00:04:36,355 --> 00:04:36,699
Rym: You know what?

118
00:04:37,162 --> 00:04:38,179
Scott: How come you haven't run away?

119
00:04:38,802 --> 00:04:41,320
Rym: 'Cause I enjoy spending a lot of money.

120
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:46,293
Scott: I'm telling you what, as soon as I get the opportunity and I rebuild that savings, I'm gone.

121
00:04:47,158 --> 00:04:47,499
Scott: See ya.

122
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:57,620
Rym: The thing is, I think the moment of truth for me was the day when I realized that my average monthly credit card bill was equal to what I still owed on my student loan.

123
00:04:58,604 --> 00:04:59,816
Rym: And I was like, "Yeah, paying that

124
00:04:59,937 --> 00:05:00,059
Rym: off.".

125
00:05:00,647 --> 00:05:01,499
Scott: You got it way low.

126
00:05:02,965 --> 00:05:04,019
Rym: I paid it off a long time ago.

127
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,198
Scott: Yeah, you know what, though?

128
00:05:05,821 --> 00:05:10,720
Scott: I'm pretty sure I still have a lot of student loan that my parents are paying, but that's their problem.

129
00:05:12,387 --> 00:05:13,293
Scott: And, you know, they would pay rent.

130
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,000
Rym: Tell your mom to listen to the show and we'll see what happens.

131
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,139
Scott: Yeah, they paid the rent for Colony and stuff a bunch of times.

132
00:05:19,562 --> 00:05:20,259
Scott: Not getting that back.

133
00:05:21,104 --> 00:05:22,719
Rym: I didn't pay the rent a bunch of times.

134
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:23,695
Scott: Good job.

135
00:05:24,462 --> 00:05:25,398
Rym: Nothing really came of it.

136
00:05:26,922 --> 00:05:27,652
Rym: Actually, really, nothing.

137
00:05:27,915 --> 00:05:28,280
Rym: But anyway.

138
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,240
Scott: Except for the car repo.

139
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,500
Rym: That was a separate... So, not paying the rent had nothing to do with not paying the car payment.

140
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,280
Rym: While they had the same root cause, the effects were different.

141
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,939
Rym: The effect of not paying rent was zero.

142
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:40,937
Scott: Anyway.

143
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:41,460
Rym: No effect.

144
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,700
Scott: So, anything going on for you?

145
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,639
Rym: This made the rounds.

146
00:05:45,543 --> 00:05:49,700
Rym: And I feel like I should talk about it, but I'm not that interested in the specifics of the actual event.

147
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:51,480
Rym: Other than that, it's kind of hilarious.

148
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,640
Rym: But the fact that this made the rounds is interesting.

149
00:05:54,741 --> 00:05:57,460
Rym: And it drummed up a whole bunch of secondary conversations.

150
00:05:58,121 --> 00:05:59,438
Rym: I figure I'll start with just this.

151
00:06:00,183 --> 00:06:00,659
Rym: Someone tweeted.

152
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:01,939
Rym: Good old tweet.

153
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:06,060
Rym: And the tweet was from AICNAnime.

154
00:06:07,185 --> 00:06:08,180
Scott: Ain't it cool news?

155
00:06:08,445 --> 00:06:08,580
Rym: I know.

156
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:09,840
Scott: He's a really good tweeter.

157
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,679
Scott: He tweets all sorts of obscure, awesome anime shit.

158
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,020
Rym: He's right up there with Daryl Surrett in terms of people I follow and enjoy.

159
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:16,620
Rym: He's awesome.

160
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,179
Scott: I think his name's Scott, too, but it's not me.

161
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:27,178
Rym: "Boston mayor's office of consumer affairs and licensing looking anime Boston attendee crime bad

162
00:06:27,258 --> 00:06:27,899
Rym: behavior.".

163
00:06:28,964 --> 00:06:29,337
Scott: Uh-huh.

164
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,060
Rym: Now, when I saw that, I sort of immediately noticed.

165
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,720
Rym: It was getting retweeted a whole bunch, and there were discussions popping up everywhere.

166
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:58,360
Rym: And when I thought about it, I thought about all the conventions I've been to in my entire life and based purely on either privileged information, where while I have some semi-reasonable backing, it is not information I can share because I got it from trusted sources, and also confirmation bias and completely anecdotal bullshit.

167
00:06:58,503 --> 00:06:58,880
Scott: That's right.

168
00:06:59,842 --> 00:07:10,140
Rym: I feel like the kinds of things that this article talks about happen way more at AnimeCon specifically than other kinds of conventions.

169
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:17,080
Scott: Pretty much every convention you go to has some sort of, you know, drama or events.

170
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:25,980
Rym: Yeah, but I'm talking specifically about police involved, someone is taken away, like hospitalization due to something other than just, like, heat stroke or dehydration.

171
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,980
Scott: I haven't seen a lot of hospitalizations.

172
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:34,020
Rym: Scott, there has been an ambulance at some point at every AnimeCon we've been to.

173
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,220
Scott: Right, but they're mostly, you know, I think most of them are that kind of, you know, there's a person who's sick legitimately.

174
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,400
Rym: No, it's almost always for the rave.

175
00:07:42,641 --> 00:07:43,340
Scott: Yeah, sometimes.

176
00:07:44,322 --> 00:07:45,360
Rym: I've seen an ambulance.

177
00:07:45,821 --> 00:07:47,480
Scott: I've seen a few in my day.

178
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,920
Rym: The majority of the Otakons I've been to that was involved with the rave in some fashion.

179
00:07:52,562 --> 00:07:54,379
Scott: Really, I was usually eating during this, I wouldn't know.

180
00:07:54,722 --> 00:07:55,638
Rym: I used to go to those things.

181
00:07:55,907 --> 00:07:56,280
Rym: You did.

182
00:07:57,361 --> 00:08:02,160
Scott: But, you know, police involvement, I mean, even PAX, the cops show up once or so, right?

183
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:10,540
Scott: It's like, no matter what, even AutoShow, the cops show up once or something, because, you know, there was the PAX where someone tried to steal the source code.

184
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,060
Rym: All right, so wait.

185
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:21,489
Rym: That's a very different class of incident of one guy committing what I would call a real crime versus the underage drunken party.

186
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,700
Rym: or someone flips out at the rave and passes out.

187
00:08:26,124 --> 00:08:27,780
Rym: Or a fire code violation crazy party.

188
00:08:27,901 --> 00:08:30,320
Scott: Well, I mean, you know, some conventions don't have a rave, right?

189
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:30,900
Scott: Exactly.

190
00:08:32,706 --> 00:08:35,059
Scott: If you have a rave, that's the kind of thing that might happen.

191
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:50,660
Rym: I mean, my experience as staff at conventions through the years has taught me that the majority of incidents that involve the police and/or the likelihood of police at conventions are, it's like half and half between the rave and shoplifters in the dealer's room.

192
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:51,980
Scott: Yeah, shoplifters in the dealer's room.

193
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,901
Rym: Like 50/50.

194
00:08:52,901 --> 00:08:55,880
Scott: Yeah, theft is always a concern at every convention.

195
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:09,700
Rym: Yeah, but this incident in particular is interesting because, literally, according to the article, and I looked around, this is the only legitimate news source I can find on it, Bad Draw for Hotel Anime Party by Laurel J. Sweet and Dave Wedge.

196
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,620
Rym: So it took two people to write this two paragraph, I guess they split it up, paragraph each.

197
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:19,080
Scott: Well, because they couldn't just get something from the AP Newswire, they actually had to journalize and go and investigate.

198
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,160
Rym: Yeah, but they didn't, so here's what I find hilarious about this.

199
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:32,037
Rym: The first paragraph points out that the hotel has to testify now before the mayor's office of consumer affairs and licensing, which seems odd?

200
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,677
Scott: We've thought about it.

201
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,960
Rym: So the mayor's office for consumer affairs and licensing.

202
00:09:40,602 --> 00:09:42,119
Scott: Yeah, because it's Anime Boston.

203
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,033
Rym: Yeah.

204
00:09:43,602 --> 00:09:52,040
Scott: I think that the city sort of gives permission for these things, and it's the Boston, whatever, convention center, Massachusetts Convention Center authority.

205
00:09:53,546 --> 00:10:04,580
Rym: My point is that this is the branch that's investigating this, because they don't say what they're going to testify about specifically other than the incident, but the fact that it's this office as opposed to some other office.

206
00:10:05,303 --> 00:10:17,197
Rym: lets us read into a lot of what is going to be discussed there, because if it's licensing due to the fact that Anime Boston, the name, could reflect on the city of Boston, that is not a conversation I think Anime Boston wants to be involved in.

207
00:10:19,546 --> 00:10:34,760
Scott: No matter what you do, especially if you do something big that involves 20,000 plus people, there is at least one regulatory body of some government that has some control over you, and this happens to be one of them, and it's probably upset for PR reasons.

208
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:45,000
Rym: But at the same time, the fact that this is the event that causes this, which was a hotel party, which in my opinion has nothing to do with the convention.

209
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,439
Rym: The convention shouldn't even be involved in that.

210
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:49,120
Scott: Well, was it the official rave?

211
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:57,160
Rym: No, no, Scott, this incident is, let's see, see there are two incidents, there was a hotel room thing that happened.

212
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,438
Scott: So it was in a hotel room.

213
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,986
Scott: And there was the fact that the rave got shut down supposedly by the police.

214
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,620
Scott: So the rave is Anime Boston's problem because that's their official event.

215
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,800
Rym: Yes, but that's not what this article is about.

216
00:11:13,122 --> 00:11:13,165
Scott: Oh.

217
00:11:13,661 --> 00:11:25,437
Rym: This article is about, quote, here, "Police reported dangerous overcrowding, pot possession, a passed out party goer, and an assault at the FED for Anime Boston 2012 fans.

218
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,338
Rym: The celebration of Japanese cartoons threw thousands of costume fans to the Heinz Convention Center, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

219
00:11:32,061 --> 00:11:32,643
Rym: At 1 a.m.

220
00:11:32,663 --> 00:11:35,254
Rym: on April 8th, cops showed up at a party at the

221
00:11:35,415 --> 00:11:35,977
Rym: Sheraton.".

222
00:11:37,243 --> 00:11:40,960
Scott: But the thing is, that could be an official Anime Boston thing.

223
00:11:41,141 --> 00:11:43,140
Rym: Exactly, the article doesn't say.

224
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,360
Scott: Oh, so was it an official Anime Boston party?

225
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,459
Rym: The article doesn't say.

226
00:11:46,841 --> 00:11:48,179
Scott: Or, well, that matters a lot.

227
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,360
Rym: I know, and the article doesn't say.

228
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:50,982
Scott: Great.

229
00:11:51,325 --> 00:11:53,040
Scott: Way to go, two people investigating.

230
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,540
Scott: Can't even get the important information.

231
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:55,002
Rym: Yep.

232
00:11:55,022 --> 00:12:01,538
Rym: What's funny is they reported, and I love this quote, "A clearly disturbed 20-year-old male who'd been kicking and punching

233
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:01,880
Rym: EMTs.".

234
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:03,718
Scott: Alrighty.

235
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:06,456
Rym: "And less than an ounce of

236
00:12:06,537 --> 00:12:06,859
Rym: pot."

237
00:12:07,533 --> 00:12:07,780
Rym: Alright.

238
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:14,839
Rym: Why is that even... In the beginning, it's like marijuana possession, then it's like less than an ounce.

239
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:20,839
Scott: That's one of those things where it's like you get someone for something, and then you search him for every other possible thing.

240
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:21,876
Scott: Yep.

241
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:29,278
Scott: It's like, "Oh, we caught this guy robbing a convenience store, and when we searched him, we found a gun and an ounce of

242
00:12:29,318 --> 00:12:29,579
Scott: crack.".

243
00:12:29,801 --> 00:12:31,330
Scott: It's like, "Well, add it to the list.

244
00:12:31,732 --> 00:12:31,873
Scott: It's

245
00:12:31,934 --> 00:12:32,215
Scott: there.".

246
00:12:33,141 --> 00:12:37,000
Scott: But the half ounce of weed wasn't the trigger.

247
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,378
Scott: It was the punching and kicking of the EMTs.

248
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,680
Rym: Yeah, yeah, well, and the quote, "dangerous overcrowding," whatever.

249
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,887
Rym: But here's the other thing.

250
00:12:43,169 --> 00:12:44,940
Rym: We're picking apart this tiny article.

251
00:12:45,922 --> 00:12:50,340
Rym: I point out that it's not Anime Boston that is even testifying here.

252
00:12:50,927 --> 00:12:51,517
Scott: I know, it's the hotel.

253
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:59,060
Rym: It's the management of the hotel, which, while is tied to the convention center pretty tightly, is a distinct entity in some regards.

254
00:12:59,142 --> 00:12:59,436
Rym: It is.

255
00:13:00,262 --> 00:13:08,177
Rym: Now, what really makes this interesting is that, one, there's a discussion in the forum where someone's like, "Hey, why was the informal dance shut down?

256
00:13:08,217 --> 00:13:08,359
Rym: What

257
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:08,560
Rym: happened?".

258
00:13:09,161 --> 00:13:10,239
Scott: Oh, informal dance.

259
00:13:10,701 --> 00:13:14,636
Rym: And the response from Anime Boston was, "We'll post more information

260
00:13:14,717 --> 00:13:15,078
Rym: later.".

261
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,080
Rym: Uh, they haven't yet, obviously.

262
00:13:19,122 --> 00:13:20,315
Rym: Actually, oh, wait, wait, okay, great.

263
00:13:20,336 --> 00:13:20,659
Rym: Look at this.

264
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,637
Rym: "Anime Boston staff will post information about this within the near future, sometime this week or

265
00:13:24,677 --> 00:13:24,798
Rym: so.".

266
00:13:25,342 --> 00:13:26,458
Rym: That was posted on April 8th.

267
00:13:27,587 --> 00:13:27,691
Scott: Okay.

268
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,180
Rym: I don't see any further information.

269
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,579
Scott: I don't think that many people care.

270
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:37,759
Rym: Yeah, except, we can't tell how many people care, because, quote, "To prevent the spread of rumors and misinformation, I am locking this

271
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:38,140
Rym: thread.".

272
00:13:38,941 --> 00:13:41,939
Scott: Uh, I guess, uh, okay, people, listen up, right?

273
00:13:42,861 --> 00:13:43,504
Scott: It's the internet.

274
00:13:43,705 --> 00:13:47,120
Scott: Anyone can post information they want anywhere on the internet, and you can't stop them.

275
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,660
Rym: You're better off having it in your domain, where you can at least respond to it in a centralized place.

276
00:13:51,962 --> 00:13:52,940
Rym: And see all of it.

277
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,800
Rym: Instead of having the discussion about the incident on the GeekNights forum and the other one on the Fast Karate forum.

278
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:04,760
Scott: Locking threads, banning, all that kind of stuff is stupid and only creates drama.

279
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:10,860
Scott: You just allow people just to talk freely, and things will be much better off.

280
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:11,985
Rym: I'll qualify that.

281
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:14,640
Rym: You still ban the spammers, you know, the usual stuff.

282
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:20,760
Scott: The spam is different from, right, some guy who's strongly disagreeing with you and fighting with you and you don't like what he's saying.

283
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,260
Rym: Yeah, but there are situations where I'm fine with the bans and all these things.

284
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:44,580
Rym: Locking a thread that's just a shitfest, but in this case, it only bothers me when anyone, I'm not singling out Anime Boston here by any means, when there's a controversial thing, it's like their first go-to thing, especially fan-run conventions, is to hush it up as much as possible and lock and delete any threads in their own forums related to it.

285
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,154
Scott: Yeah, it's like, "No, just let it

286
00:14:46,194 --> 00:14:46,417
Scott: go."

287
00:14:46,902 --> 00:14:48,179
Scott: Even though, well, we'll see.

288
00:14:48,501 --> 00:14:56,860
Rym: So the other thing that's interesting is, in a related discussion, I'm going to quote an executive for Anime Boston from the forum.

289
00:14:57,261 --> 00:15:00,140
Scott: Oh, okay, so if they post in the forum, that's effectively an official statement.

290
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:08,160
Rym: Now, this was an unrelated story about someone who claimed a drunken staffer banged on their hotel room door in the middle of the night and demanded to search it.

291
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,939
Scott: We've had that kind of problem before.

292
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,760
Scott: That happened to us at Anime Boston last year.

293
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,600
Scott: It wasn't a staffer, though, it was just a dumb other kid.

294
00:15:15,821 --> 00:15:16,738
Rym: Who was also drunk.

295
00:15:17,901 --> 00:15:26,580
Rym: Quote, "As part of working with the hotel, they prefer to have us involved in things like this when the room is part of our block.

296
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,734
Rym: I suppose it helps to make sure we're as in the loop as possible.

297
00:15:32,261 --> 00:15:36,780
Rym: Continuing most conferences, as in like professionals having a big meeting, involve a lot of drunk people.

298
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:40,219
Rym: Handling situations like this is definitely not something that the hotel would be surprised by.

299
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:45,918
Rym: If anything, allowing us to handle disturbance calls is something of a courtesy before hotel security calls the real

300
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:46,139
Rym: place.".

301
00:15:46,762 --> 00:15:47,867
Scott: No!

302
00:15:47,887 --> 00:15:48,048
Scott: No, no, no.

303
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:55,180
Scott: Why do you, someone's in their hotel room, why should that have anything to do with your convention?

304
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,820
Rym: Even if it's in your room block, you gotta stay as far away from that as possible.

305
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,259
Scott: Yeah, that has nothing to do with you.

306
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,840
Rym: And this is my main point.

307
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,779
Scott: Let the real police come.

308
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:03,499
Rym: This is my main point.

309
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,500
Rym: There are incidents that happen at all sorts of conventions.

310
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:12,380
Scott: Even like they said, ones with office guys at, you know, conferences for financial bullshit.

311
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,140
Scott: Now, at the same time- Even when the president goes to Columbia.

312
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:22,940
Rym: Those conventions, like for example, whatever drama happens at PAX, they're pretty open about explaining what happened.

313
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,940
Rym: And two, they don't get involved in stuff that happens outside of the convention.

314
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,020
Scott: Yeah, if you make trouble in the PAX hotel, PAX has nothing to do with that.

315
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,880
Rym: If the hotel kicks you out, well, that's your fault.

316
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,540
Scott: Yeah, and the thing is, I don't understand this hotel doing these kind of things, right?

317
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:43,640
Rym: It's like- No, if I ran a hotel, I would never let the staff of a convention knock on rooms.

318
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,039
Rym: Like, doors of rooms.

319
00:16:45,562 --> 00:16:49,600
Rym: Now, I don't know if that itself was allowed, because they basically said that wasn't allowed.

320
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,119
Rym: And there's a whole other drama there.

321
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,367
Scott: But the fact that- It's like the only people who are going to knock on any room.

322
00:16:54,427 --> 00:17:01,300
Scott: doors are police, people who are trying to visit, you know, just- Like, I'm trying to knock on Rym's door because I'm his next door neighbor or something, you know.

323
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,600
Scott: Legitimate door knocking.

324
00:17:03,304 --> 00:17:04,380
Scott: Or, hotel staff.

325
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:05,339
Scott: That's it.

326
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,460
Scott: Not going to have convention staff.

327
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:08,720
Scott: It's like, you're not hotel staff.

328
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:09,598
Scott: You're not doing shit here.

329
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:16,240
Scott: Whether you do have the convention staff clean some rooms, maybe have some hotel staff do some panels, it's like, come on, no.

330
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,297
Scott: That's not how it works.

331
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,479
Rym: So, I found that whole part of it really interesting, too.

332
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:41,920
Rym: But I guess, in all this, I'm wondering if this will be a change just for Anime Boston, because if the hotel management now has to talk to the city about, you know, whatever incident, then that might force the hotels that are actually connected to deal with something that is a problem for pretty much every big anime con.

333
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,851
Rym: Every room has 12 people in it.

334
00:17:46,082 --> 00:17:51,895
Rym: And if the hotels actually enforce occupancy- The convention attendance will go,

335
00:17:51,935 --> 00:17:52,117
Rym: "Ding!"

336
00:17:52,862 --> 00:17:56,459
Rym: Or, the hotels will all be full and there won't be rooms for anyone else.

337
00:17:57,262 --> 00:17:57,739
Scott: Also true.

338
00:17:59,387 --> 00:17:59,720
Rym: We'll see.

339
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,780
Rym: I've got a lot of other things to say about attendance and the way people act at cons, but that's not the thing I want to focus on.

340
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:11,060
Scott: But then the thing about this, if you can't actually get seven people in a room because they crack down and they actually check, and you get kicked out, right?

341
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,160
Scott: It's like, a lot of those punk kids couldn't afford the hotel room unless they have seven people's worth of money.

342
00:18:16,844 --> 00:18:17,140
Rym: Yeah.

343
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,320
Scott: So they won't even be able to come at all, regardless of whether the hotel's full or not.

344
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:26,779
Rym: Now, one final interesting piece of all this is that, of course, people are commenting on it.

345
00:18:27,488 --> 00:18:28,219
Scott: All over the place.

346
00:18:29,645 --> 00:18:30,620
Rym: No, no, out on the internet.

347
00:18:31,483 --> 00:18:35,420
Rym: The thing that was tweeted that was the progenitor of this whole conversation.

348
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,138
Scott: Oh, so not the drunken staff story, but the-.

349
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,870
Rym: Because we knew, I mean, people were texting me while I was at PAX saying, "Yo dawg, cops are at Anime Boston, shit's going

350
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:44,010
Rym: down.".

351
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,480
Rym: So it's not like that was news.

352
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,248
Scott: That's not a "yo

353
00:18:46,288 --> 00:18:46,612
Scott: dawg.".

354
00:18:47,842 --> 00:18:50,639
Rym: They just said, "Yo dawg" does not necessarily mean "the yo

355
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:50,820
Rym: dawg.".

356
00:18:50,902 --> 00:18:51,220
Rym: It does.

357
00:18:51,301 --> 00:18:52,636
Rym: I was not using "the royal yo

358
00:18:52,656 --> 00:18:52,939
Rym: dawg.".

359
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,377
Rym: Sometimes, people colloquially will say, "Yo

360
00:18:55,397 --> 00:18:55,720
Rym: dawg.".

361
00:18:55,781 --> 00:18:56,249
Scott: No, that's just

362
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:56,472
Scott: "yo.".

363
00:18:57,164 --> 00:18:57,652
Rym: You can say "yo

364
00:18:57,693 --> 00:18:57,978
Rym: dawg.".

365
00:18:58,221 --> 00:18:59,731
Scott: No, not unless it's "yo dawg,".

366
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:01,080
Scott: I put the X in your ex.

367
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,240
Rym: Scott, that's the royal yo dawg.

368
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,259
Scott: I heard you like eggs.

369
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:05,677
Scott: I put it in your ex.

370
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:13,000
Rym: One side thing, dances at anime cons are a cesspool of bullshit drama.

371
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:17,920
Rym: And as much as I used to like them, I feel like the cons would be better served getting rid of them.

372
00:19:18,501 --> 00:19:20,300
Scott: I think you could just make them better.

373
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,399
Rym: Well, I think you could.

374
00:19:24,681 --> 00:19:30,420
Rym: However, I don't think any fan anime con can, because it would require professionals.

375
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,460
Scott: It would also require changing the existing culture and existing expectations.

376
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:44,720
Rym: No, no, no, you could fix it without changing the culture top-down, but then you would have to have professional people managing the rave itself in a heavy-handed manner.

377
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:49,253
Scott: Right, but what I'm saying is that you would have this rave, but you're gonna change the way, you're gonna change raves at cons, right?

378
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:50,280
Scott: So you have your different rave.

379
00:19:51,081 --> 00:19:52,940
Scott: All these people show up expecting the usual.

380
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,603
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

381
00:19:53,624 --> 00:19:56,760
Rym: The first year, the people who expect that get kicked out.

382
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,240
Scott: And they're gonna come in and do what they expect to happen there.

383
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,819
Rym: And they get kicked out, and then the other people who generally avoid it come in.

384
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:07,380
Scott: They're not gonna come in because they're also expecting the usual.

385
00:20:07,982 --> 00:20:10,260
Rym: Ah, no, because word travels fast in the modern era.

386
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,540
Rym: I think top-down can work just as well as seated bottom-up.

387
00:20:15,283 --> 00:20:24,820
Rym: However, I think top-down is impossible at fan conventions, having staffed Otakon, Kinetacon, Katsucon in my time, among other cons.

388
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:31,220
Rym: And I think seated bottom-up can't work, because I've been to anime cons for the last decade.

389
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,598
Scott: So anyway, I got some news here.

390
00:20:33,342 --> 00:20:40,879
Rym: The only last thing is that people commenting on this are making the dumbest possible recommendations as to what Anime Boston should do.

391
00:20:42,025 --> 00:20:51,940
Rym: The most common one is you should make the dance 18+, and the badges should be coded like Magfest does with their wristbands, so I know if someone's jailbait.

392
00:20:54,282 --> 00:20:59,700
Rym: Anyway, so look at this whole shitstorm from this tiny tweet, and we still don't know what really happened.

393
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,746
Scott: Whatever, who cares.

394
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:02,520
Scott: Typical con drama bullshit.

395
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,171
Scott: So, here's some real news.

396
00:21:04,211 --> 00:21:05,340
Scott: that's actually really good news.

397
00:21:05,661 --> 00:21:12,100
Scott: So, Tor, if you don't know, Tor is a sci-fi book publisher that is an imprint of Macmillan, right?

398
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,060
Scott: So there's really only five big book publishers.

399
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,760
Rym: Not Tor the Router or Tor the Guy, one with Burning Wheel.

400
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,265
Rym: Right.

401
00:21:18,285 --> 00:21:23,597
Scott: There's only really five or six big book publishers in the US, and all the other publishers are small, whatever, right?

402
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:28,800
Scott: But all of those publishers are really big and have a bunch of smaller imprints and labels underneath them, right?

403
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:32,900
Scott: And I think it's like Macmillan, Hachette, I don't remember all of them, right?

404
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,800
Scott: But anyway, so Macmillan, their sci-fi books are published under the label Tor.

405
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,780
Scott: Tor, coincidentally, is Cory Doctorow's publisher, right?

406
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:49,400
Scott: But anyway, that's related to the story because they just decided to abandon all DRMs on their ebooks.

407
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,104
Scott: Hooray!

408
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:51,922
Scott: Hooray!

409
00:21:51,982 --> 00:21:58,880
Scott: I can now buy ebooks legitimately instead of just, you know, pirating or only getting free Gutenberg books.

410
00:22:00,484 --> 00:22:01,540
Scott: So that's pretty awesome.

411
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:07,760
Scott: And what's interesting is you read this article, and it's on Forbes, and it's actually a pretty long, significant article.

412
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:15,039
Scott: It's funny because there's a picture of Neil Gaiman in the article, that picture of him with his white dog, but there aren't any quotes from him or even mentions of him.

413
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:32,900
Scott: But anyway, the thing is, there's like multiple quotes in here from like book publishers and Charlie Stross and all these people, and one anonymous publishing executive, all talking about how, you know, "Yeah, DRM, we let Amazon and Apple control us,".

414
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:37,430
Scott: and all, you know, they're saying all the right things, but it's like, "Why you do this now?

415
00:22:37,571 --> 00:22:40,096
Scott: In 2012, you should have had this shit in

416
00:22:40,197 --> 00:22:40,217
Scott: '98.".

417
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:42,102
Scott: Right?

418
00:22:42,122 --> 00:22:44,472
Scott: You're only, oh, 10, 15 years too late?

419
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:51,460
Rym: The thing is, the entire industry is just as late, if not, not even there yet.

420
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,900
Scott: Yeah, but they're sort of, you know, I'm hoping that this causes a wave of DRM-free across the board.

421
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:01,960
Scott: But what it's really, the thing this is really going to cause, right, is obviously piracy is not going to go up, right?

422
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,974
Scott: That's just not going to happen because anyone who wants to pirate is already pirating.

423
00:23:05,236 --> 00:23:05,940
Scott: It's not going to change.

424
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:13,220
Scott: Sales might go up because all those people, you know, sort of like me, who are like, "I'm not buying your no DRM book," might buy them.

425
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,466
Scott: But they got to lower the price, right?

426
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:16,129
Scott: I'm not paying.

427
00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:18,880
Scott: I was on, I went to Amazon the other day, I was looking at this book.

428
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:23,172
Scott: The hardcover book, no, the paperback cover book price was $10.97.

429
00:23:23,172 --> 00:23:26,200
Scott: The Kindle price was $9.99.

430
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:26,541
Scott: It's like,

431
00:23:26,561 --> 00:23:28,066
Scott: "No."

432
00:23:29,169 --> 00:23:29,450
Scott: Right?

433
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:36,595
Scott: Even if it's, and the thing is, in the article, they sort of talk about how, "Yeah, people weren't willing to pay as much because they weren't actually getting the book.

434
00:23:36,635 --> 00:23:37,398
Scott: They were just getting this

435
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:37,820
Scott: license.".

436
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,317
Scott: And I'm like, "No, I'm not willing to pay as much because I'm getting some file and not

437
00:23:42,638 --> 00:23:42,919
Scott: paper.".

438
00:23:43,662 --> 00:23:48,020
Scott: If you give me a file, whether it's DRM'd or not, you're getting, like, a dollar.

439
00:23:49,101 --> 00:23:51,440
Rym: The thing is, I don't want paper at all anymore.

440
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:56,380
Scott: That's true, but I still, I'm not willing to pay, even though I don't want paper.

441
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:01,440
Rym: Scott, the cost of the paper is the minority of the, you know, why it costs what it costs.

442
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,640
Scott: I know, but I'm still not willing to pay a lot for a file.

443
00:24:04,961 --> 00:24:06,224
Rym: I think the argument's very simple.

444
00:24:07,548 --> 00:24:16,079
Rym: Regardless of piracy, even if piracy didn't exist, no piracy in the entire world and no secondary market for any new media because of crazy DRM.

445
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:20,119
Rym: There's already enough books I haven't read.

446
00:24:20,422 --> 00:24:20,839
Scott: Exactly.

447
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:26,080
Rym: I could spend my entire life reading if I gave up all other forms of media.

448
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:34,800
Scott: Right, the reason I'm not willing to pay so much is because there's just so many books, I could just spend the rest of my life reading Project Gutenberg and never have another book.

449
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:40,000
Rym: Yet for the book club, you choose a relatively new and not super cheap for a free book.

450
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,369
Scott: No, I don't.

451
00:24:41,974 --> 00:24:42,520
Scott: But you know what?

452
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,960
Rym: Was that book, well, we haven't read it yet, so I can't say if it's worth it.

453
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,239
Scott: You know how I acquired said book?

454
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,100
Rym: You pirated it?

455
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,720
Scott: With my friend, Captain.

456
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:52,119
Scott: That's how I got that book.

457
00:24:53,061 --> 00:24:54,960
Rym: I might pay for it, just because.

458
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,680
Scott: It's supposed to be a really good book, but anyway.

459
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,680
Rym: You don't want to forgive that author any money, fuck that.

460
00:25:00,263 --> 00:25:01,399
Scott: Well, I mean, you know.

461
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,880
Rym: Well, well.

462
00:25:03,704 --> 00:25:04,100
Scott: Well what?

463
00:25:04,441 --> 00:25:05,098
Rym: You pirated it.

464
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,179
Scott: I pirated a lot of things.

465
00:25:06,424 --> 00:25:06,513
Rym: Yup.

466
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,220
Scott: That's how the world works.

467
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,140
Rym: So what if the book's awesome?

468
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,319
Rym: You gonna rectify that?

469
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,400
Rym: You just gonna let it be not paid for?

470
00:25:12,661 --> 00:25:14,800
Scott: No, but I might buy other books by the author.

471
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,120
Rym: Or just pirate those.

472
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:18,059
Scott: Or maybe, maybe not.

473
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:22,380
Scott: It's case by case basis decision making here, right?

474
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,380
Scott: You know, it's how it goes.

475
00:25:24,581 --> 00:25:25,900
Scott: You know, I don't know if I'm gonna like it yet.

476
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,539
Scott: I'm not gonna pay for it before I know if I like it, right?

477
00:25:28,965 --> 00:25:29,719
Scott: Some land of mystery.

478
00:25:30,643 --> 00:25:30,880
Scott: Anyway.

479
00:25:32,262 --> 00:25:34,540
Scott: Uh, but yeah, this is good to see, right?

480
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,559
Scott: Because the music industry already sorta did this.

481
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,960
Scott: And now, you know, even though it didn't help them, because they're still stupid.

482
00:25:40,521 --> 00:25:41,919
Scott: And now, books are doing it.

483
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:48,620
Scott: So, pretty much it's movies and, you know, video games sorta kinda, maybe, did it kinda.

484
00:25:49,002 --> 00:25:49,659
Scott: In some cases.

485
00:25:50,062 --> 00:25:50,738
Rym: Except Steam.

486
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,300
Scott: Yeah, it's sorta DRM, but sorta not.

487
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:53,999
Scott: It sorta is.

488
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,698
Scott: Well, it is.

489
00:25:54,862 --> 00:25:55,159
Rym: It is.

490
00:25:55,365 --> 00:25:55,980
Rym: The only difference.

491
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,339
Scott: There's no beating around the bush, it's DRM.

492
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:57,521
Scott: The

493
00:25:57,561 --> 00:26:10,740
Rym: only difference is that Steam makes a very important point, not to shift the topic and dwell on this, that there is a kind of DRM that is permissive enough and safe enough from a company that we trust enough because they have enough goodwill with the right prices

494
00:26:10,922 --> 00:26:11,651
Scott: to where

495
00:26:11,853 --> 00:26:12,258
Rym: I'll do

496
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:12,359
Scott: it.

497
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:16,852
Scott: It's still bullshit, though, that you should be able to transfer any Steam game to someone else.

498
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:24,860
Rym: Yeah, but that will not happen without the Supreme Court saying that we have a right to first sale on digital goods.

499
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:29,020
Scott: Well, we've already had courts, like, one or two steps under that saying the very thing.

500
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,400
Rym: Scott, the Supreme Court.

501
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,220
Scott: Remember the AutoCAD case.

502
00:26:31,421 --> 00:26:32,500
Rym: The current Supreme Court.

503
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,210
Scott: Autodesk vs.

504
00:26:33,231 --> 00:26:33,720
Scott: What's His Face.

505
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,180
Rym: Scott, the current Supreme Court.

506
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:39,160
Rym: What do you think they are gonna rule on something like that?

507
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,536
Scott: That's why no lawyers have pushed it.

508
00:26:41,168 --> 00:26:41,380
Scott: Yeah.

509
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,820
Scott: 'Cause they know it's not right, but anyway.

510
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,600
Rym: They're not even gonna listen to a case like that.

511
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,080
Scott: But this gives me hope that maybe within, like, a few years, the stupid movie people will come around, right?

512
00:26:50,382 --> 00:26:52,479
Scott: If I owned a big movie company, you know what I would do?

513
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,578
Scott: This is what I would do.

514
00:26:53,680 --> 00:27:10,874
Scott: I mean, we talk about this all the time anyway, but it's like when a movie came out, I would have it out in the theater and on the DVD and digital and the Blu-ray and the TV pay-per-view and the HBO and everything and every country and every language

515
00:27:11,376 --> 00:27:12,699
Rym: simultaneously.

516
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,258
Scott: And that would be it.

517
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,379
Scott: It would just be the release.

518
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:17,318
Scott: It's out.

519
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,680
Scott: You want or you like Netflix?

520
00:27:19,226 --> 00:27:19,920
Scott: It's on Netflix.

521
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,940
Scott: You like downloading an HD for five bucks?

522
00:27:23,146 --> 00:27:23,639
Scott: It's there.

523
00:27:24,886 --> 00:27:26,678
Rym: So Scott, you're gonna finish your thing, right?

524
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,020
Rym: You're American.

525
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:29,759
Rym: It's in English.

526
00:27:30,124 --> 00:27:30,220
Rym: Yep.

527
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,200
Rym: You're gonna wait to release it until you translate it into every human language?

528
00:27:34,181 --> 00:27:37,200
Scott: The translation would be simultaneous with the production.

529
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:41,320
Rym: So you're gonna hire people to translate it during production into every human language?

530
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:41,547
Scott: No.

531
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,640
Scott: Any language which was profitable to translate it into.

532
00:27:45,126 --> 00:27:45,274
Rym: Right?

533
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,975
Scott: You're not gonna translate it into Swahili if you don't have a lot of fans and speak Swahili.

534
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:56,255
Scott: But obviously, you know, French, Chinese, probably good bets, Spanish, probably a good idea.

535
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,340
Scott: You know, there's big fans.

536
00:27:59,364 --> 00:28:00,380
Rym: Why not just Esperanto?

537
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,020
Rym: That everyone in the world will understand you.

538
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,399
Scott: Because nobody understands us.

539
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,700
Scott: Portuguese, probably a good choice.

540
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,739
Scott: A lot of people in Brazil.

541
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:16,080
Rym: So there's one thing that apparently the entire world can agree on.

542
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,660
Rym: With the exception of one people.

543
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,800
Scott: That things of the day are awesome.

544
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,539
Rym: Oh, you want me to say it?

545
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,060
Rym: Things of the day.

546
00:28:24,142 --> 00:28:26,600
Rym: That Salmiakki is fucking awful unless you're Finnish.

547
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,640
Rym: It's disgusting.

548
00:28:28,342 --> 00:28:32,179
Rym: So this is a real commercial, as far as I can tell, from Finland.

549
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,995
Rym: And the catchphrase is...

550
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,798
Scott: I'm pretty sure that is the most popular Salmiakki brand, because that's the one that I see the most often.

551
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:44,440
Rym: So the catchphrase is basically, "The world hated Finnish beloved.

552
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,912
Rym: Mailman vihatwin, swoman

553
00:28:48,973 --> 00:28:49,958
Rym: rakatstituin.".

554
00:28:50,723 --> 00:28:52,900
Scott: Timo's probably like banging his head against the wall.

555
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,479
Scott: I'm sure the Finnish listeners are just like,

556
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:54,540
Scott: "Ah.".

557
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:57,215
Rym: No, but I've learned that the word for "world" in Finnish is apparently

558
00:28:57,255 --> 00:28:57,698
Rym: "mailman."

559
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:58,859
Rym: Like straight up.

560
00:28:59,281 --> 00:28:59,665
Scott: I think it's

561
00:28:59,746 --> 00:29:00,638
Scott: "maaliman.".

562
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,589
Rym: Yeah, but it's

563
00:29:01,629 --> 00:29:01,973
Rym: "mailman.".

564
00:29:03,122 --> 00:29:09,158
Rym: Anyway, so the commercial shows a whole bunch of non-Finnish people eating the Salmiakki-flavored ice cream.

565
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:15,280
Scott: The ice cream looks like a Klondike bar and a stick, but it's a diamond, which is the shape of the Salmiakki.

566
00:29:15,321 --> 00:29:15,880
Rym: They are reacting.

567
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:18,960
Rym: I think one guy says something like, "This is fucking horrible.

568
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:19,684
Rym: Ugh.".

569
00:29:20,102 --> 00:29:21,239
Rym: Like they can't deal with it.

570
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,120
Rym: And then it cuts to a bunch of Finnish people, and they're all like, "Oh, this is great.

571
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:26,511
Rym: Salmiakki,

572
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:26,614
Rym: yeah.".

573
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,639
Scott: It's ice cream that tastes like Salmiakki, yeah.

574
00:29:29,103 --> 00:29:30,440
Rym: And they just keep eating it.

575
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:36,356
Rym: I love the fact that the advertising campaign for the Salmiakki is basically, "Everybody hates this except

576
00:29:36,396 --> 00:29:36,518
Rym: you.".

577
00:29:37,501 --> 00:29:41,700
Scott: Yeah, it's like, "Be awesome Finnish people that like things the rest of the world hates.

578
00:29:42,526 --> 00:29:44,100
Scott: Aren't we better than the rest of the world?

579
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:45,176
Scott: Ah, yeah, because we like this

580
00:29:45,196 --> 00:29:45,379
Scott: thing.".

581
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:54,199
Rym: I also like this word "utus" that, as far as Google knows, means novelty, but it's got four U's in it and only two other letters.

582
00:29:54,741 --> 00:30:03,978
Scott: I gotta say, this commercial really has sort of balls, the same way those Domino's commercials have balls, where they're like, "Our pizza sucks, but come on, eight bucks, and we know it sucks.

583
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:04,879
Scott: We tried to improve it.

584
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,620
Scott: Just try it at least once.

585
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,360
Rym: It reminds me a little bit of that Maasauhusets commercial.

586
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:11,654
Rym: Maasauhusets.

587
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:12,499
Scott: All right, anyway.

588
00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:14,219
Scott: So check out this thing of the day.

589
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:14,720
Rym: I'm checking.

590
00:30:15,062 --> 00:30:17,900
Scott: Do you remember that video that was the thing of the day a long time ago that was so awesome?

591
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,740
Rym: Yeah, that video that was the awesome thing of the day.

592
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,159
Scott: That was how a differential works in a car.

593
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:22,951
Rym: Oh, yeah.

594
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,177
Scott: Great video.

595
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,240
Scott: This video is Mechanical Principles.

596
00:30:26,782 --> 00:30:29,220
Scott: It's a 1930 film by Ralph Steiner.

597
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:36,813
Scott: It's four minutes long, and it shows you all kinds of really clever mechanical things to where it's like, "Oh,

598
00:30:36,934 --> 00:30:37,439
Scott: snap.".

599
00:30:37,683 --> 00:30:38,600
Rym: Those are sexy gears.

600
00:30:39,282 --> 00:30:41,337
Rym: They all have the same cadence where you watch it and you go,

601
00:30:41,417 --> 00:30:41,518
Rym: "Huh?".

602
00:30:41,981 --> 00:30:47,078
Scott: I'm looking at the video on YouTube right now, and the fourth suggestion is how differential gear works.

603
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,639
Scott: Parentheses, best tutorial.

604
00:30:50,542 --> 00:31:02,640
Scott: Yeah, I always like these kind of videos, and I think this sort of mechanical engineering is not a lost art, because you can go to school and learn this if you want to, but it used to be sort of like the only thing, right?

605
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,000
Scott: But now, there's a lot more kinds of engineering.

606
00:31:07,382 --> 00:31:10,800
Scott: Even in kinds of engineering, there's multiple levels, right?

607
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:18,000
Scott: You might work on cars, but only work on computers in cars, or you might only work on combustion engine.

608
00:31:19,682 --> 00:31:25,500
Scott: It's like this sort of raw mechanical engineering thing, there's fewer and fewer people who know it, and it's so awesome.

609
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,832
Scott: When you look at it, it's like, "Oh, shit, that's

610
00:31:27,912 --> 00:31:28,254
Scott: sweet.".

611
00:31:29,545 --> 00:31:30,679
Scott: When did people get so smart?

612
00:31:31,541 --> 00:31:35,132
Rym: In the meta moment, this weekend, the 28th and 29th is the Mocha Fest 2012 in New York.

613
00:31:37,941 --> 00:31:41,839
Scott: If you don't know, from past years, we've gone to this thing like five or six years in a row.

614
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:43,920
Rym: It's one of my favorite things of the year.

615
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:47,240
Scott: It's the Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art, which is a museum that you can go to.

616
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:47,760
Scott: I'm a member.

617
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,720
Scott: I think it hasn't expired, my membership.

618
00:31:50,181 --> 00:31:51,740
Rym: Mine did expire because I forgot to renew it.

619
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,511
Scott: It's their festival, which is basically what they do.

620
00:31:54,591 --> 00:31:58,620
Scott: is that museum sponsors this festival, which is their biggest fundraiser of the year.

621
00:31:58,901 --> 00:32:00,040
Rym: It is technically a fest.

622
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,700
Scott: Yes, they go to the Lexington Armory, which is their current location.

623
00:32:04,162 --> 00:32:05,440
Scott: Years ago, it used to be a different building.

624
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:05,980
Scott: The Puck Building.

625
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:13,160
Scott: They fill it with tables, and they sell those tables to indie comic publishers and indie comic artists, even some non-indies.

626
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:20,900
Rym: You will have super professional, world-famous artists next to a kid who hand-drew something and stapled it together and cut it out himself.

627
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,556
Scott: Some SVA student kid.

628
00:32:21,801 --> 00:32:21,950
Scott: Yep.

629
00:32:22,281 --> 00:32:22,939
Scott: Most of the time.

630
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:25,319
Rym: A lot of SVA and RISD stuff there.

631
00:32:25,923 --> 00:32:27,040
Scott: Those SVA kids are really good.

632
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,480
Rym: Yeah, they are.

633
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:28,199
Scott: They stand out.

634
00:32:28,621 --> 00:32:29,419
Scott: We used to play the game.

635
00:32:30,021 --> 00:32:30,126
Rym: SVA?

636
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:31,540
Scott: Yeah, right?

637
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:41,720
Scott: Basically, what you do is you go to this thing, you buy a ticket, you just buy it at the door, and you walk around for two to three hours looking at every single booth, and it's all totally awesome, and you get a sack full of comics.

638
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,859
Scott: Then you go eat lunch somewhere nearby, and then you go home, and it is the awesome weekend.

639
00:32:46,521 --> 00:32:50,959
Scott: It's two days if you're really obsessed, but you really only need to go for a few hours on one day.

640
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,220
Scott: That's all that's necessary.

641
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,599
Scott: It'd be too crowded if everyone stayed the whole time.

642
00:32:55,161 --> 00:32:55,778
Rym: Just walk around.

643
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:59,979
Scott: There are some cool panels if you really want to wait in line and figure out where they are and such.

644
00:33:00,761 --> 00:33:03,580
Scott: I've never found it worth it, but there are amazing people at these panels.

645
00:33:03,821 --> 00:33:09,258
Rym: The key is to walk around the entire place methodically and stop at every booth and just look at what's there.

646
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:16,578
Rym: I defy you, unless you don't bring money with you on purpose, to walk out without a pile of comics.

647
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:21,740
Scott: Yeah, and the thing is, a lot of times, people, especially people without a lot of money, are money conscious.

648
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:27,500
Scott: At the mocha, the strategy is do not care about monies, except for crazy cases, right?

649
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,800
Scott: It's like, just go around, and if you see something cool, just get it.

650
00:33:31,222 --> 00:33:35,820
Scott: The only times that you would hold back is giant, fancy, hundred dollar hardcover.

651
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:40,800
Scott: Then you can start to think about maybe not buying it, but it's like, oh, a little foldy comic.

652
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:41,871
Scott: Someone printed a Kinko's.

653
00:33:41,993 --> 00:33:42,499
Scott: buy that.

654
00:33:42,901 --> 00:33:44,500
Scott: Oh, a cute little turtle thing.

655
00:33:44,661 --> 00:33:45,198
Scott: Buy that.

656
00:33:45,643 --> 00:33:46,900
Rym: Oh, it's a comic about poop.

657
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,340
Scott: Gotta buy that, right?

658
00:33:49,124 --> 00:33:50,720
Rym: I still have the diarrhea diaries.

659
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:58,580
Scott: Just fill up your bag with all the goodies, and then when you get home, everyone you brought with you just spread the shit out on the floor and be like, oh, snap.

660
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,499
Rym: I wish I could get more prison comics, though.

661
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,999
Scott: And then just sort of roll around in the comics like, uh.

662
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:11,719
Rym: So not the following weekend, but the weekend after that, May 11th and 12th is Zenkai-Khan in Pennsylvania.

663
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:12,511
Scott: Why so soon?

664
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,840
Rym: We will be there doing two panels or lectures.

665
00:34:18,243 --> 00:34:23,920
Rym: I forget what they are, but one of them is about both My Little Pony, Friendship is Magic, and Dude Bro.

666
00:34:24,241 --> 00:34:27,280
Rym: My shit is fucked up, so I got to shoot/slice you two.

667
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,480
Rym: It's straight up dog time.

668
00:34:28,902 --> 00:34:29,719
Scott: At least you remember the name.

669
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:31,119
Scott: How could you forget that?

670
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,273
Scott: So basically rehashing an old panel that is good and...

671
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,860
Rym: Mashing it up with another concept about mashups.

672
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,639
Scott: Throwing ponies in there to get people in the door.

673
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,239
Rym: Not just that, we got some points to make.

674
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,840
Rym: And when we're not, we're only going to be there Saturday.

675
00:34:45,562 --> 00:34:46,320
Rym: When we're not...

676
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,619
Scott: It's a Friday and Saturday con.

677
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:51,520
Rym: Doing our thing at the convention, probably going to be...

678
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,960
Scott: Scott Johnson knows we're only going to be there Saturday, right?

679
00:34:53,346 --> 00:34:54,078
Rym: I assume so.

680
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,196
Rym: We're pretty much going to be hanging out in the little tabletop area playing German bargains.

681
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,920
Scott: Yeah, they have a very tiny tabletop area.

682
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,820
Scott: I don't know if it'll be changed this year and be less tiny, but that doesn't matter.

683
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:10,479
Scott: What matters is they actually have... It's not the greatest game selection, which still goes to ConnectiCon as the greatest board game library.

684
00:35:11,341 --> 00:35:16,639
Scott: It's not as big as the PAX one, which, while not as good as the ConnectiCon one in terms of selection, is very large.

685
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:23,379
Scott: But they do have choice stuff, and they have a large amount of it relative to the amount of people playing it.

686
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,332
Scott: So it is definitely good time.

687
00:35:25,372 --> 00:35:26,580
Scott: tabletop at Zenkai Con.

688
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:32,300
Scott: In addition to all their other great programming, which is mostly anime and sci-fi-ish stuff in nature.

689
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:32,648
Scott: Yup.

690
00:35:33,722 --> 00:35:36,760
Rym: It's one of the few cons where if you want to hang out with us, we're kind of just chilling.

691
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,520
Scott: It's one of the only small cons we go to, and we go because our friends run it.

692
00:35:40,862 --> 00:35:40,951
Rym: Yup.

693
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:48,771
Rym: Speaking of cons our friend run, we do all the panel programming for ConnectiCon, which is July 13th, 14th, and 15th this year.

694
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,737
Rym: So make your panels, I'll put the link in.

695
00:35:54,001 --> 00:36:05,840
Rym: I'm already scheduling, so get your panel in as soon as possible, because the longer you wait, the less likely it is that I will accept your panel, or give you a time that isn't like 8am on Friday.

696
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,099
Scott: But we do have a lot more rooms this year.

697
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:08,726
Rym: 11 rooms!

698
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:19,614
Scott: So we can fit a lot in there, so we do need as many applications as possible, because the more applications we get, the more we can pick out the chocolate and get rid of the shit.

699
00:36:20,062 --> 00:36:24,219
Scott: If we get like two applications and they're bullshit, well guess what, there's gonna be two shitty panels, end of con.

700
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:31,959
Rym: So two weekends after that is Otakon, I'm just saying, you anime fans, if you want us to be at Otakon, tell Otakon that.

701
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:37,880
Rym: Because we went to, we presented panels- We could just buy badges when we go.

702
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:39,520
Rym: I'm not gonna go as an attendee.

703
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:39,769
Rym: Me either.

704
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,680
Rym: I'm gonna go because you guys want me to show you some anime.

705
00:36:43,441 --> 00:36:50,560
Rym: But I think seven years in a row we did panels at Otakon, so if we're not there, it's because they didn't want us, not because we did not offer.

706
00:36:51,822 --> 00:36:54,199
Rym: And of course Pax Prime, not too long after that.

707
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,877
Scott: Badges went on sale for Pax Prime today.

708
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,060
Rym: Pause GeekNights now, go buy 'em.

709
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:14,640
Scott: If you are going to go to Pax Prime in Seattle- If you think you might go- Immediately, this second, as in Pause GeekNights and buy the badges, if you don't, then shut up, you're not going.

710
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,139
Scott: Just assume you're not going if you don't buy them right now.

711
00:37:17,421 --> 00:37:20,500
Rym: So Scott, how long before it sells out?

712
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,060
Rym: What do you think?

713
00:37:21,843 --> 00:37:22,600
Rym: What's the over-under?

714
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,352
Scott: A month or two.

715
00:37:24,567 --> 00:37:25,240
Rym: I want to make a bet.

716
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:28,800
Scott: They brought the site down today, there was so much traffic trying to register it.

717
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:32,320
Rym: I'll bet you 60 days from today- That's what I just said.

718
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,479
Rym: It'll be sold out, exactly.

719
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:35,180
Rym: How much you willing to bet?

720
00:37:35,561 --> 00:37:37,574
Scott: I don't bet monies on things that I am not 100% sure of.

721
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,499
Rym: So then you don't bet.

722
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:53,289
Scott: What I can do is I will tell you this, I will go and look at the official Pax Twitter account, and I will look through the archives to last year to find the exact day they sold out last time and the day they went on sale last

723
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:55,480
Rym: time- I think that will be a failing proposition

724
00:37:55,542 --> 00:37:55,938
Scott: for you.

725
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,760
Scott: See how many days it took to sell out last year?

726
00:37:59,201 --> 00:38:02,060
Scott: I will bet that it will be less days than that.

727
00:38:02,904 --> 00:38:03,840
Rym: That's a sure bet.

728
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:07,220
Scott: That's why I'm betting, I only bet when it's a sure bet.

729
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:21,479
Rym: Considering how many people were denied access to Pax East and considering this time in particular, how many people panicked when they didn't get badges to Pax East, they went to the Prime website and saw they couldn't buy badges and assumed that was also sold out.

730
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,580
Rym: And Pax Dev and other stuff, and then not too long after that, Pax East.

731
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,038
Scott: Is Pax Dev even for sure?

732
00:38:28,661 --> 00:38:29,540
Scott: I'm trying to find that out.

733
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:38,020
Scott: It wasn't an explosive success last time, it was just kind of cool, and they haven't officially said that they're doing it again, so it may or may not happen.

734
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:45,699
Rym: The website is still up and there is a countdown to August 24th, 2011, but it is- I guess that means it's happening.

735
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:47,922
Rym: Oh.

736
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,360
Rym: But it is counting down.

737
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:51,343
Scott: Hmm.

738
00:38:52,702 --> 00:38:53,000
Scott: Interesting.

739
00:38:53,341 --> 00:38:54,060
Rym: Interesting, indeed.

740
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:54,919
Rym: It's not counting up.

741
00:38:55,301 --> 00:38:57,700
Scott: Well, we don't know if there will be a Pax Dev 2 or not.

742
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,096
Rym: I will probably go if there is, but we'll see.

743
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:07,578
Rym: If I have vacation days, I would probably like to go- I will try to confirm, I'll do some investigative journalism for you if it is in fact happening or not.

744
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,778
Scott: We could just email somebody we know and be like,

745
00:39:09,798 --> 00:39:09,879
Scott: "Hey.".

746
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:13,800
Rym: That's investigative journalism, ask somebody, and then follow up on that asking.

747
00:39:14,164 --> 00:39:14,398
Scott: Okay.

748
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,418
Rym: That's what you do.

749
00:39:16,001 --> 00:39:18,160
Rym: If that doesn't work, then you go and look at stuff.

750
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,379
Scott: All right, so, animes.

751
00:39:21,481 --> 00:39:30,500
Rym: So Lupin the Third, the woman called Fujiko Mine, is the first Lupin thing in a long time.

752
00:39:30,821 --> 00:39:36,178
Scott: Well, the first Lupin thing in a long time that wasn't just one of those made for TV movies that they made for every year.

753
00:39:36,683 --> 00:39:38,579
Rym: That I did not ignore.

754
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:49,820
Rym: Because it is common knowledge that the quality of a Lupin-related thing, and in terms of time from, what was the last good Lupin thing?

755
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,220
Rym: It's got to be something after Momo that was at least decent.

756
00:39:53,301 --> 00:39:55,399
Scott: It was the movie where they were in Rio.

757
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,960
Rym: The Secret of the Village, where Lupin keeps all his stuff.

758
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,720
Scott: I don't remember what year that one was, though.

759
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:00,978
Rym: Yeah, I know.

760
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,259
Rym: That might have been the last good one.

761
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,059
Scott: Ignore what that one was named.

762
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,119
Rym: There was the one where Lupin was dead.

763
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:11,297
Scott: There's the one about where Zenigata loses his job, and he's eating ramen and he's all sad.

764
00:40:12,501 --> 00:40:16,899
Rym: It's pretty much Fuma Conspiracy and Cagliostro for me.

765
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:20,380
Scott: Well, and the two TV series, the old one and the newer one.

766
00:40:21,122 --> 00:40:22,980
Scott: The second TV series, the one that was on Cartoon Network.

767
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:27,560
Rym: The point is, Lupin recently has not been, shall we say, exciting and/or choice.

768
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:34,999
Scott: He's sort of like one of those things where he's a popular, well-known character in Japan and they sort of bring him out every year.

769
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:39,960
Scott: Maybe he's equal in popularity to Garfield in the US, something like that.

770
00:40:40,581 --> 00:40:43,799
Scott: Everyone knows him, but not too many crazy fans.

771
00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:48,420
Scott: Not super ultra-popular constantly, but he comes around all the time.

772
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:57,800
Rym: It's like, imagine if James Bond's stuff in America were more prolific and not all that good, even though it's not all that good, though I think Timothy Dalton gets a bad rap and I digress.

773
00:40:57,981 --> 00:41:00,456
Scott: Anyway, so they bring out a new TV series.

774
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,178
Scott: That's sort of a big deal.

775
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:05,780
Scott: Because it's like, whoa, it's just been sort of like one made-for-TV movie per year.

776
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,455
Rym: Now I heard this and I was like, "Oh, whatever, it's gonna be another shit,

777
00:41:08,475 --> 00:41:08,817
Rym: Lupin.".

778
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:15,038
Rym: And then I saw the art and I thought, "There's no way the show looks like

779
00:41:15,078 --> 00:41:15,258
Rym: this.".

780
00:41:15,962 --> 00:41:16,734
Rym: Then I saw the trailer.

781
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,780
Scott: Yeah, it was not a Wonder Woman situation.

782
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:23,099
Rym: And in the trailer, I thought, "There is no way the show looks like this.

783
00:41:24,044 --> 00:41:24,533
Rym: It looks like

784
00:41:24,574 --> 00:41:24,757
Rym: that.".

785
00:41:25,001 --> 00:41:26,200
Scott: The show looks like the cover.

786
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:27,000
Scott: It is great.

787
00:41:27,081 --> 00:41:27,620
Scott: It looks like the opener.

788
00:41:27,722 --> 00:41:28,479
Rym: I really like it.

789
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,780
Scott: Well, the art, obviously, is astounding.

790
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:37,337
Scott: I mean, I love it when anyone tries to do a unique style and they just went all out with it.

791
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:47,000
Rym: But it is such a homage to the old '70s style Lupin and animation, but yet it's also got a modern sensibility.

792
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:56,000
Scott: Well, that's the whole thing, is that what they've done with this show is they've taken the core of what Lupin is all about and applied the modern sensibility and mixed it up.

793
00:41:56,060 --> 00:42:04,479
Scott: So you're watching it and you see the old-school Lupin shine through this modern, totally brand new anime sheet.

794
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,080
Scott: And it's like, "Aw, snap.

795
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:06,487
Scott: This is

796
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:06,938
Scott: awesome.".

797
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:18,145
Rym: And it's telling that we are somewhat disconnected from the majority of anime fans because the first comment when this was first announced on the Funimation website is, and I quote, "Wassup,

798
00:42:18,165 --> 00:42:18,515
Rym: Lupin?".

799
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:20,478
Rym: "I watched episode one and liked it.

800
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,116
Rym: My one complaint is I'm not sure I like this animation

801
00:42:24,157 --> 00:42:24,579
Rym: style.".

802
00:42:26,641 --> 00:42:35,620
Rym: The thing that made me the most excited is the thing the first person who got off his butt to post about was, "Oh, I guess this is the last comment, not the first comment.

803
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:36,208
Rym: It's sorted

804
00:42:36,392 --> 00:42:36,779
Rym: weirdly.".

805
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:37,010
Rym: Anyway.

806
00:42:37,446 --> 00:42:37,700
Scott: Anyway.

807
00:42:38,041 --> 00:42:38,849
Rym: That's the first comment.

808
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:39,900
Rym: you see if you look here.

809
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:40,320
Scott: Okay.

810
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:41,138
Scott: Sure.

811
00:42:42,061 --> 00:42:45,340
Rym: So, Scotty, you want to do the one, two, three, even though I think we've tipped our hand.

812
00:42:46,386 --> 00:42:46,900
Scott: There's no point.

813
00:42:47,001 --> 00:42:47,820
Rym: I think we've tipped our hand.

814
00:42:48,222 --> 00:42:54,080
Scott: I really like this show, but not- I mean, it's good, but it's not, "Aw, yeah.

815
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:54,305
Scott: You're the

816
00:42:54,326 --> 00:42:54,736
Scott: awesomest.".

817
00:42:55,004 --> 00:42:55,380
Scott: It's just like-.

818
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,056
Rym: Well, Scotty, this is a preview.

819
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,120
Rym: We've only seen three episodes.

820
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:58,680
Scott: That's enough.

821
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,365
Rym: And it's on the level of.

822
00:43:00,385 --> 00:43:05,258
Rym: I will watch the next episode when it comes out pretty much right away.

823
00:43:05,522 --> 00:43:06,279
Scott: What day does it come out?

824
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,059
Rym: I don't even know.

825
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,120
Rym: I just check every day.

826
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,719
Scott: I'll check like once a week, probably on the weekend, and just watch it.

827
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:15,318
Rym: There have been three episodes, and if you have not watched this yet, one, if you're an anime fan, just watch it.

828
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:16,219
Rym: Just watch it.

829
00:43:16,301 --> 00:43:17,300
Rym: Don't even ask about it.

830
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:22,219
Scott: We should mention that in order to watch it, you need to go and get a free login at Funimation's website- But then it just works.

831
00:43:22,361 --> 00:43:24,200
Scott: And then you search for Lupin and then watch it.

832
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:29,699
Scott: Now, the thing is, this show is not actually about Lupin, which every previous Lupin has been, or at least most of them.

833
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,020
Scott: It's actually about Fujiko, right?

834
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:36,120
Scott: And the thing is, so far, the three episodes, the first episode was Fujiko and Lupin.

835
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:40,020
Scott: The second episode is Fujiko and Jigen, and the third episode is Fujiko and Goemon.

836
00:43:40,661 --> 00:43:45,420
Scott: So it's like, it's about Fujiko, but it's also about the other Lupin characters.

837
00:43:46,021 --> 00:43:49,880
Scott: Also, it's- I don't know what's canon and what's not.

838
00:43:50,242 --> 00:43:54,759
Scott: Lupin isn't the kind of thing- it's more like a- Lupin is more like a Matsumoto-verse kind of situation.

839
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:58,980
Rym: I was about to say, well, was Kat and Harlock before or after Lupin?

840
00:43:59,120 --> 00:43:59,227
Rym: Right.

841
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,279
Rym: Castle of Cagliostro.

842
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:00,997
Scott: Exactly.

843
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,920
Scott: But this is, chronologically, an ultra-prequel.

844
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:13,760
Scott: Episode one was the first meeting of Lupin and Fujiko, theoretically, even though that may have been portrayed in a manga or an anime previously.

845
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,611
Scott: This is the beginning.

846
00:44:16,841 --> 00:44:22,120
Rym: The majority of anime fans in America probably have seen maybe one or two Lupin movies.

847
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:22,830
Scott: Maybe.

848
00:44:23,881 --> 00:44:26,419
Rym: Maybe an episode or two of the TV show because it was on TV.

849
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:31,140
Scott: I actually think newer fans, right, anyone, you know, have not seen any.

850
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:34,034
Scott: And it's sort of like, you know, it's like, so there's like.

851
00:44:34,054 --> 00:44:37,079
Scott: the current generation of fan hasn't seen any Lupin, might not even know who he is.

852
00:44:37,361 --> 00:44:40,680
Scott: The previous generation, some of them saw it on Cartoon Network.

853
00:44:41,143 --> 00:44:44,140
Scott: And then the generation before that and before that- Watched every movie.

854
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:50,260
Scott: They would only have seen it if they were like us with the anime club kind of situation where someone's exposing you to Lupin on purpose.

855
00:44:50,381 --> 00:44:53,159
Scott: But my point is that- And then, of course, the old school people know all about it.

856
00:44:53,260 --> 00:45:02,500
Rym: This show, it's a super-prequel that requires no knowledge of Lupin whatsoever other than the vague idea that Lupin is a thief.

857
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,100
Scott: Well, okay, it doesn't require knowledge of Lupin, right?

858
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,817
Scott: You can watch this and completely understand everything that's going on and it will introduce the characters to you.

859
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:24,818
Scott: But, a lot of the enjoyment comes from already knowing, not, you don't need to know the plots or any particular previous Lupin show or movie, but you have to know the characters, personalities and what they're about.

860
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:29,720
Scott: And if you know that, then watching this gives you that special extra enjoyment.

861
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:40,140
Rym: Well, Scott, we've said the same thing about other things before, I mean, even the movie of Galaxy Express is like a compressed- Yeah, but I think- There's moments in it where you think about what happened in the show and it feels very different.

862
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:46,040
Scott: I'm just saying that if I knew nothing about Lupin and I watched this, it probably would have been okay and not really good.

863
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:49,200
Rym: I think it still would have been pretty good because- Pretty good, but not really good.

864
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:54,080
Rym: The characters that are presented are fascinating in their pathologies.

865
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:55,478
Scott: They are, indeed.

866
00:45:55,981 --> 00:45:58,620
Rym: And that alone, I'd be really interested in following that thread.

867
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:09,740
Rym: But of course, we have the knowledge of the way Lupin and her interact is special just for the sense that she is the one who straight up kills that guy.

868
00:46:10,183 --> 00:46:12,080
Rym: And Lupin is the one like, "Whoa, really?

869
00:46:13,008 --> 00:46:13,499
Rym: You killed him?

870
00:46:13,863 --> 00:46:14,218
Rym: Jesus.

871
00:46:15,964 --> 00:46:17,275
Rym: I mean, I'll kill people, but come

872
00:46:17,537 --> 00:46:17,598
Rym: on.".

873
00:46:19,741 --> 00:46:26,131
Rym: And the way that she interacts with Goemon is great if you have seen all the rest of Lupin.

874
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:37,540
Scott: I think it's really cool in that even though it has the same visual style and the same sort of idea that's a prequel, it focuses on Fujiko, is that so far the three different episodes have been very different.

875
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:44,300
Scott: The first episode, which was about Lupin and Fujiko, had a lot of that Lupin wackiness and zaniness going on, right?

876
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:50,476
Scott: You know, like, "Oh my God, there's a dude riding a Buddha made of

877
00:46:50,556 --> 00:46:51,218
Scott: drugs.".

878
00:46:52,901 --> 00:46:56,340
Scott: That's so Lupin, riding a motorcycle on a clown face.

879
00:46:57,325 --> 00:46:58,100
Scott: That's what he does.

880
00:46:58,301 --> 00:47:02,977
Rym: We've talked about this recently a lot, that people think of Cagliostro as our typical Lupin.

881
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,000
Rym: No, that is atypical Lupin.

882
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:06,800
Rym: Typical Lupin is drug Buddha.

883
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:21,477
Scott: The Jigen episode, right, was very serious and dark and a lot of killing people and serious But also it felt very Fistful of Dollars, kind of like a modern Western because of what he was doing.

884
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,420
Rym: He's a bodyguard for the mob who killed his former boss.

885
00:47:24,802 --> 00:47:25,619
Rym: What's going on?

886
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:36,300
Scott: And then the Goemon episode was sort of sweet and cute and sort of funny and a lot of ridiculous cutting of things.

887
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:38,039
Rym: I have cut yet another trifling thing.

888
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,380
Scott: Yeah, if you don't know, that's like a catchphrase.

889
00:47:41,282 --> 00:47:43,980
Scott: You would sort of get it, but he's used that catchphrase before, forever.

890
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:44,900
Rym: But here's the thing.

891
00:47:45,401 --> 00:47:56,240
Rym: This show, I feel like, if you don't know anything about Lupin, you'll see Goemon cutting all the clothes off people and watching just this episode.

892
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:00,860
Scott: Did you notice that after he cut the dude's clothes off, then they ran to the next train car, the guy still had the clothes off.

893
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:03,760
Scott: That shows you that they're paying attention in this show.

894
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:15,099
Rym: But the fact that the sheer ridiculousity of that moment is very muted by everything else that is going on around it to where you almost just go with it.

895
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,319
Scott: The thing is, I'm wondering, right, this fourth episode, is it out yet?

896
00:48:18,904 --> 00:48:19,399
Rym: I don't know.

897
00:48:20,001 --> 00:48:21,159
Scott: Is it going to be?

898
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,560
Scott: Number one, it could focus on Zenigata, but Zenigata was sort of in the Lupin episode.

899
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,040
Scott: He was, but he was after Lupin, not after her.

900
00:48:28,301 --> 00:48:28,720
Scott: Exactly.

901
00:48:29,362 --> 00:48:39,540
Scott: It also, alternatively, right, even if it is or if it isn't, either the fourth or the fifth episode, is it just going to be a Fujiko doing something on her own?

902
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:44,164
Scott: Are they going to start a plot that actually links the serial plot or is it continue to be episodic?

903
00:48:44,567 --> 00:48:46,700
Scott: or are they going to start bringing the characters together?

904
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,880
Scott: Because it's still the show is supposed to be about Fujiko, right?

905
00:48:50,462 --> 00:48:52,680
Scott: Also, how many episodes is the show going to be in total?

906
00:48:53,245 --> 00:48:54,158
Rym: I didn't even look that up.

907
00:48:54,704 --> 00:48:54,880
Rym: Yeah.

908
00:48:56,221 --> 00:49:02,440
Scott: So this is going to be pretty interesting, but I'm going to watch and continue to watch whatever they put out for as long as 12 episodes.

909
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,780
Scott: I'm watching the whole thing, no matter what.

910
00:49:05,222 --> 00:49:07,379
Rym: And there are no titles yet for the rest of the episodes.

911
00:49:07,843 --> 00:49:09,159
Scott: Oh, keeping me in suspense.

912
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:09,626
Scott: Yeah.

913
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:10,453
Scott: Snap.

914
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:16,859
Scott: But yeah, good job on them, you know, putting the episodes for free streaming on Funimation.com with subtitles right away.

915
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:18,239
Scott: I can't complain.

916
00:49:18,688 --> 00:49:18,899
Rym: Yeah.

917
00:49:19,201 --> 00:49:20,539
Scott: I mean, oh no, I have to log in.

918
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:23,399
Scott: I made the account and you don't even have to verify email address, just works.

919
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:31,260
Rym: So the one thing that I do want to touch on is that it is, shall we say, boob-tacular?

920
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,260
Rym: Boob-tastic?

921
00:49:34,182 --> 00:49:34,516
Rym: Boobs.

922
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:36,280
Scott: But... Lots of boobs.

923
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:42,719
Scott: I mean, Fujiko has been known for showing off her gigantic, crazy boobs, which are even bigger than Naga the Serpent's boobs.

924
00:49:43,080 --> 00:50:02,560
Rym: What I can say about this, and I say this without any hint of irony, I'm not, you know, and they are two, like, exploitative boobs from '70s shows, or Old Lupin, what Black Dynamite is to black exploitation movies.

925
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,078
Scott: Exactly.

926
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:04,928
Scott: But the boobs come out.

927
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:07,380
Scott: all the, even in the Go-Mon episode, the boobs came out.

928
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:11,959
Scott: But at the same time... The boobs are all, usually when you watch an opener to an anime, there'll be like one boob shot.

929
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:14,219
Scott: This is nothing but boob shots.

930
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:14,860
Scott: Right?

931
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,600
Scott: And it's not even like James Bond openers where you get a boob silhouette.

932
00:50:17,802 --> 00:50:18,478
Scott: It's just boobs.

933
00:50:18,825 --> 00:50:19,799
Scott: But... All over the place.

934
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:22,800
Rym: But at the same time, it's starting to really fit in this narrative.

935
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:43,300
Rym: Like, if you've seen a bunch of Lupin, but you haven't like read the manga and watched the entire, all the TV shows, so like, you know who these characters are, but you don't like really know the stories or the back history or anything, then Fujiko usually is portrayed as this kind of foil of Lupin, kind of a bitch, messes everything up, funny, like she comes in and messes stuff up at the last minute.

936
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:52,334
Rym: But this is portraying her much more as someone who is deeply disturbed in the same kind of way.

937
00:50:52,820 --> 00:51:00,718
Rym: Like, you're getting this impression that she, Goemon, Lupin, Zenigata, and Jigen are deeply disturbed people with...

938
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:08,340
Scott: Yeah, it's trying to seriously examine their actual characters while keeping their characters completely ridiculous as they were in the original show.

939
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:09,659
Scott: Now some of the Lupins have gone into that.

940
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:19,111
Scott: It's sort of like how they took Batman, right, and at first Batman was just, you know, detective or whatever, and then later on they tried to examine him like, "Oh, he's a crazy guy, his parents got shot,".

941
00:51:19,232 --> 00:51:20,100
Scott: you know, whatever.

942
00:51:20,402 --> 00:51:21,531
Rym: There have been some Lupins that get into...

943
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,759
Scott: Is Bruce Wayne or Batman the mask?

944
00:51:23,981 --> 00:51:25,099
Rym: Why does the Lupin steal?

945
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,900
Rym: Like the one where they have the village where he puts all the stuff he steals.

946
00:51:28,404 --> 00:51:28,538
Scott: Yep.

947
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,619
Rym: And it's the treasure, it's always something like that.

948
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,359
Rym: But we haven't gotten that for the other characters, and this is sort of like...

949
00:51:34,621 --> 00:51:35,920
Scott: Also nothing's canon, right?

950
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:37,219
Scott: It's like they probably just forget all that.

951
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:52,036
Rym: No, but this show is sort of taking the other characters and putting their pathologies in stark relief and really focusing on them through the lens of following Fujiko and how pretty fucked up she is.

952
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,278
Scott: Yeah, well, they're all fucked up, I mean, right?

953
00:51:54,440 --> 00:52:02,340
Rym: Yeah, but by using her as the focus, it's putting all of the other characters in a similar focus even though they're not the actual focus of the show.

954
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:09,880
Scott: Yeah, well, I mean, because most other Lupins, the focus was always on the plot and the characters were just sort of being themselves the whole time.

955
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:13,540
Scott: There was very little character development in most Lupin things.

956
00:52:14,842 --> 00:52:18,020
Scott: And even when there is, it doesn't necessarily stick, right?

957
00:52:18,161 --> 00:52:30,959
Scott: There might be something that explains... There might try to add something that someone's passed as part of the plot of a particular movie or episode, but that doesn't really stick and it's not really mentioned outside of that movie or episode.

958
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:48,182
Scott: And based on the ending animation for this new show, it seems like they're going to explore Fujiko's past somehow, because they show all these pictures of her when she was young and such, so it's like, "Oh, they're going to tell us about what Fujiko was doing, how she got here,".

959
00:52:48,203 --> 00:52:51,320
Scott: because that's never explained in anything that I can remember ever watching.

960
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:55,580
Rym: That closer definitely makes a very dark implication that she's always been this way.

961
00:52:55,780 --> 00:53:02,208
Scott: But it's also sort of, "Eh," because it's like, "Oh, 15-year-old Fujiko with boobies hanging out, sort of

962
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:03,055
Scott: cowering.".

963
00:53:04,345 --> 00:53:05,979
Rym: I did not get the impression of cowering.

964
00:53:06,702 --> 00:53:11,180
Rym: I got the impression of doing the same kind of tricks that she pulls all the time.

965
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:19,779
Rym: There is this dark implication in that closer that her pathology is a defect of the womb, that she has always been that way.

966
00:53:21,144 --> 00:53:22,539
Scott: Well, the ending is a little creepy.

967
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:23,360
Scott: That's all I'm saying.

968
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,759
Rym: So, the director, Sayo Yamamoto...

969
00:53:25,861 --> 00:53:26,559
Scott: What else have they done?

970
00:53:27,641 --> 00:53:32,600
Rym: It's one of those interesting stories of someone who hasn't really done a lot of straight-up.

971
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:33,440
Rym: What's the studio?

972
00:53:34,081 --> 00:53:40,440
Rym: But has done a whole bunch of storyboards and unit direction and episode direction for a whole bunch of other stuff.

973
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:41,238
Scott: And they got their chance.

974
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:41,869
Scott: Yeah.

975
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,150
Rym: I mean, the only thing he directed was

976
00:53:44,171 --> 00:53:44,392
Rym: "Technolize."

977
00:53:47,042 --> 00:53:47,560
Rym: You sure it's a dude?

978
00:53:47,681 --> 00:53:48,300
Rym: No, it's not a dude.

979
00:53:48,564 --> 00:53:48,609
Scott: Oh.

980
00:53:49,321 --> 00:53:50,380
Rym: I tend to say "he" a lot.

981
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,500
Rym: There's actually a picture of her right here.

982
00:53:51,721 --> 00:53:52,680
Rym: You fart at me while I'm talking.

983
00:53:53,988 --> 00:53:54,539
Scott: What's the studio?

984
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:56,519
Rym: I can look it up.

985
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,439
Scott: It should be right there on the page that you're on.

986
00:53:58,561 --> 00:53:59,958
Rym: I'm on the director page.

987
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:07,720
Rym: Cricket.

988
00:54:10,053 --> 00:54:10,348
Scott: Good job.

989
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:11,430
Rym: I found it.

990
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:12,330
Rym: I just don't know these companies.

991
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:18,430
Rym: The animation production is "potential," with a number 10, and TMS Entertainment...

992
00:54:19,857 --> 00:54:20,087
Scott: What?

993
00:54:20,574 --> 00:54:20,750
Rym: Yeah.

994
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:23,444
Scott: It has to be like Madhouse or Production I.G.

995
00:54:23,525 --> 00:54:23,988
Scott: or something.

996
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:25,509
Rym: There's a difference in some of that.

997
00:54:25,755 --> 00:54:26,129
Rym: Yeah, I know.

998
00:54:26,352 --> 00:54:27,529
Rym: There's a lot of different stuff.

999
00:54:29,413 --> 00:54:30,207
Scott: You're not very good at this.

1000
00:54:30,771 --> 00:54:32,430
Rym: NTV and TMS Entertainment.

1001
00:54:38,301 --> 00:54:39,839
Rym: Yeah, but I'm not familiar with either of those.

1002
00:54:42,001 --> 00:54:43,959
Rym: It's not any of the studios anyone knows.

1003
00:54:45,043 --> 00:54:45,999
Rym: Tokyo Movie Shinsha.

1004
00:54:47,421 --> 00:54:47,877
Rym: I know that.

1005
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:48,900
Rym: Don't you remember?

1006
00:54:52,281 --> 00:54:55,079
Rym: It was about the first time.

1007
00:54:55,941 --> 00:54:56,638
Rym: It was in Versailles.

1008
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:56,943
Rym: Ah.

1009
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,219
Rym: It was in Versailles, and it has it.

1010
00:55:00,932 --> 00:55:01,120
Rym: All right.

1011
00:55:01,564 --> 00:55:02,337
Rym: I found the gold mine.

1012
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:03,631
Rym: Mm-hmm.

1013
00:55:07,043 --> 00:55:07,790
Rym: One, two, three, four, five.

1014
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:09,180
Rym: All right.

1015
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:12,611
Rym: That's more than 10.

1016
00:55:12,611 --> 00:55:15,729
Rym: So it's TMS Entertainment, Tokyo Movie Shinsha.

1017
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:22,109
Rym: They did one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, eleven, a whole bunch of all the other Lupans.

1018
00:55:24,034 --> 00:55:25,250
Scott: I guess that's who does Lupan.

1019
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:28,630
Rym: Yeah, The Last Job, Stolen Lupan, all the ones I haven't seen.

1020
00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:30,050
Rym: Oh, oh, they did Pi-Cal.

1021
00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:30,909
Rym: Remember Pi-Cal?

1022
00:55:31,535 --> 00:55:31,727
Scott: No.

1023
00:55:31,931 --> 00:55:32,428
Scott: You really don't?

1024
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:33,475
Rym: Green vs.

1025
00:55:33,536 --> 00:55:34,830
Rym: Red, which I didn't see, actually.

1026
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:35,390
Scott: I didn't see that either.

1027
00:55:35,693 --> 00:55:36,089
Rym: I wanted to.

1028
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:37,229
Rym: I thought it would be good, but I didn't.

1029
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:38,040
Scott: Mm-hmm.

1030
00:55:39,258 --> 00:55:39,609
Rym: I like it.

1031
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:40,487
Rym: I'm going to watch the rest of it.

1032
00:55:41,091 --> 00:55:46,608
Rym: I can't really finally review it because, for all we know, it goes to crap after, you know, every episode we've seen.

1033
00:55:47,112 --> 00:55:48,350
Scott: I doubt it'll go to complete crap.

1034
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:52,550
Scott: Also, you know, we've done shows on Lupan before, at least two of them, I'm pretty sure.

1035
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:56,890
Scott: You know, so maybe, you know, if you watch this, or maybe go watch some other Lupans.

1036
00:55:57,030 --> 00:56:01,010
Scott: I recommend watching, of course, Castle of Cagliostro and Puma Conspiracy.

1037
00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:01,460
Scott: Yep.

1038
00:56:01,914 --> 00:56:06,690
Rym: And the second- I would recommend watching Momo just to know what Lupan's really like.

1039
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:08,410
Scott: Yeah, you can watch the second TV series.

1040
00:56:08,533 --> 00:56:09,130
Scott: That's pretty good.

1041
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:11,667
Rym: That's a little more, like, campy, punny.

1042
00:56:12,292 --> 00:56:13,550
Scott: Well, that's what Lupan's- A lot more lighthearted.

1043
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:14,210
Scott: That's what it's about.

1044
00:56:14,411 --> 00:56:17,610
Rym: Nah, some of the other movies are less punny and campy and a little more weird.

1045
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:19,430
Scott: Yeah, but, you know, you can learn all about Lupan.

1046
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:24,150
Scott: The manga is, you know, way different than, you know, the first TV series.

1047
00:56:24,351 --> 00:56:25,008
Scott: I never saw it.

1048
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:26,449
Scott: But, you know, whatever.

1049
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,550
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1050
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:39,670
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1051
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:45,090
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1052
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:48,010
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1053
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:52,750
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1054
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:56,286
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1055
00:56:57,590 --> 00:57:00,570
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1056
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:03,650
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
