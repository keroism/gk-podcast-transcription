00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,705
Rym: It's Thursday, November 15th, 2012.

2
00:00:10,705 --> 00:00:12,349
Rym: I'm Ryan.

3
00:00:13,132 --> 00:00:14,154
Rym: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:15,859
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,899 --> 00:00:20,430
Rym: Tonight on the GeekNights Book Club, the name of the wind.

6
00:00:21,352 --> 00:00:21,773
Scott: What is it?

7
00:00:22,014 --> 00:00:24,159
Rym: By Rothfuss.

8
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:24,620
Rym: Patrick.

9
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,044
Scott: Let's do this.

10
00:00:30,027 --> 00:00:33,116
Rym: That is what we call in the industry, emergent behavior.

11
00:00:33,136 --> 00:00:36,509
Scott: We used to do that in high school on purpose.

12
00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:38,858
Rym: So we did something much more complex.

13
00:00:38,898 --> 00:00:40,804
Rym: We had a game we called the chipmunk game.

14
00:00:41,466 --> 00:00:47,849
Rym: So the game was you would have a number of people and usually two people was optimal or four people.

15
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:50,300
Rym: And you would alternate through the phrase chipmunk.

16
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:52,529
Rym: So chipmunk across the people.

17
00:00:52,971 --> 00:00:58,215
Rym: And you had to just keep doing it as long as possible until somebody flipped out and threatened violence if you didn't shut the fuck up.

18
00:00:58,235 --> 00:01:00,022
Rym: That was the whole game.

19
00:01:00,724 --> 00:01:06,600
Scott: OK, so I guess I got to say, fuck the not daylight savings time.

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,723
Rym: I know it's dark.

21
00:01:08,265 --> 00:01:13,727
Rym: Seriously, why can't it stay dark until I get out of work and then be like the entire time I'm home?

22
00:01:13,928 --> 00:01:17,144
Scott: I mean, you know, I'm already feeling kind of black because it's dark.

23
00:01:17,446 --> 00:01:23,370
Scott: And I can only imagine what it's like for someone who has, you know, like actual, you know, emotional problems.

24
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:23,651
Scott: Right.

25
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:30,175
Scott: I mean, I'm making a new argument that fucking go, you know, turning off daylight savings time is killing people.

26
00:01:30,837 --> 00:01:37,648
Rym: So the argument was made when they didn't when they implemented the let's go back and forth as opposed to let's go back and never look back.

27
00:01:38,191 --> 00:01:40,704
Rym: That that was killing people because it was dark when kids went to schools.

28
00:01:40,724 --> 00:01:42,090
Rym: They'd get hit by school buses.

29
00:01:42,111 --> 00:01:44,020
Scott: Fucking don't get hit by a school bus.

30
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,928
Rym: That's good advice you should give to most kids.

31
00:01:45,948 --> 00:01:46,711
Rym: That's right.

32
00:01:47,454 --> 00:01:48,519
Scott: Anyway, I'm feeling bleh.

33
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:49,321
Rym: Blay.

34
00:01:49,421 --> 00:01:50,585
Rym: Feeling bleh?

35
00:01:50,705 --> 00:01:56,728
Rym: One of my coworkers was sick, so I was giving him the wide birth because I do not want to get sick.

36
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:58,156
Rym: I've been not sick for a long time.

37
00:01:58,176 --> 00:01:58,940
Rym: I want to maintain this.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,623
Scott: So something else.

39
00:01:59,703 --> 00:01:59,884
Scott: Right.

40
00:02:00,024 --> 00:02:04,384
Scott: You know, a lot of times people buy headphones, especially expensive ones.

41
00:02:04,444 --> 00:02:04,625
Scott: Right.

42
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:10,937
Rym: I have an expensive pair of headphones right here hanging on a hook that I. we actually haven't worn headphones doing gig nights for years now.

43
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:19,044
Scott: But anyway, the thing is, you know, what happens undoubtedly is the wire starts to not do so good and not to look so good.

44
00:02:19,065 --> 00:02:21,295
Scott: And some people, you know, actually those Dr.

45
00:02:21,315 --> 00:02:28,331
Scott: Dre stupid headphones that I don't like, you know, I'm not sure what the audio quality is like on them, but I don't wear a gigantic headphone when I walk around town.

46
00:02:28,612 --> 00:02:32,509
Scott: Those actually have a headphone cable that unplugs from the headphone.

47
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,156
Scott: So you can just replace the whole cable.

48
00:02:34,317 --> 00:02:34,779
Rym: Not bad.

49
00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:36,829
Scott: I wish other headphones would fucking do that shit.

50
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:40,528
Rym: I guess it's partly I think people don't take good care of their headphones.

51
00:02:40,809 --> 00:02:41,191
Scott: I try to.

52
00:02:41,251 --> 00:02:42,739
Scott: I take extra good care of my etymotic.

53
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:45,211
Scott: I always put them in the case and oh, my etymotic.

54
00:02:45,312 --> 00:02:46,699
Rym: I treat like gold, but you know what?

55
00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:48,346
Scott: But they still wire so fucking breaks.

56
00:02:48,587 --> 00:02:48,788
Rym: Yeah.

57
00:02:48,828 --> 00:02:51,179
Rym: The old like six, you know, barely.

58
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:53,127
Rym: Those are like the flimsiest pieces of shit.

59
00:02:53,147 --> 00:02:58,810
Rym: The only reason I kept using mine is because they they've honored my warranty like five times.

60
00:02:59,011 --> 00:02:59,332
Scott: Me too.

61
00:02:59,372 --> 00:03:02,102
Scott: Anyway, so I discovered something I didn't know about.

62
00:03:02,162 --> 00:03:04,172
Scott: that was sort of obvious in retrospect.

63
00:03:04,192 --> 00:03:04,333
Scott: Right.

64
00:03:04,453 --> 00:03:11,622
Scott: I watched a YouTube video, how to repair headphones, and he's pretty much cutting the wire, twisting the ends together, soldering them.

65
00:03:11,682 --> 00:03:11,863
Scott: Right.

66
00:03:11,884 --> 00:03:13,231
Scott: And I'm like, yeah, I know how to do all that.

67
00:03:13,272 --> 00:03:13,473
Scott: Right.

68
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:15,364
Scott: But then what he did at the end.

69
00:03:15,384 --> 00:03:15,585
Scott: Right.

70
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:18,843
Scott: See, what I do is I just take electrical tape and sort of wrap it around the weak part.

71
00:03:19,546 --> 00:03:21,112
Scott: What this guy did was genius.

72
00:03:21,193 --> 00:03:25,209
Scott: Apparently, there's a thing I did not know about called heat shrink tubing.

73
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,132
Scott: You know about this?

74
00:03:26,253 --> 00:03:30,409
Rym: Yes, I've used it extensively, mostly in Science Olympiad in middle school.

75
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:37,180
Scott: It's just a little black tube and you slide it over the wire and you take a lighter and you freaking heat that shit up and it shrinks.

76
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:42,235
Scott: And it's basically like having, you know, a real wire coating suddenly.

77
00:03:42,476 --> 00:03:42,777
Scott: Yes.

78
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:45,364
Scott: And it's welcome to electronics.

79
00:03:45,445 --> 00:03:45,725
Scott: Yes.

80
00:03:45,806 --> 00:03:51,743
Scott: Seventy seven dollars for 48 pieces in various sizes on Amazon.

81
00:03:52,144 --> 00:03:53,148
Scott: I'm buying that shit.

82
00:03:53,288 --> 00:03:55,457
Scott: So now it's like when headphones start to get weak.

83
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:56,260
Scott: Right.

84
00:03:56,721 --> 00:04:00,020
Scott: It's like, you know, the wires poking out, but the headphones still works perfectly.

85
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:00,741
Scott: Boom.

86
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,569
Scott: He drink tubing right on that motherfucker.

87
00:04:02,749 --> 00:04:16,204
Rym: All said, I just the thing is in my entire life, I'm not counting like headsets I've used for like gaming or like cheapo crap or whatever in terms of like actual headphones, like the kinds of studio headphones I'd use to like master.

88
00:04:16,225 --> 00:04:18,093
Scott: You're not going to have the wire break on those.

89
00:04:18,334 --> 00:04:24,979
Rym: Yeah, I own one pair from when I was like 11 until they broke a few years ago on my second pair ever.

90
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,965
Scott: Yeah, those things don't break.

91
00:04:26,005 --> 00:04:27,755
Scott: I'm talking about the ones that you walk.

92
00:04:27,795 --> 00:04:34,462
Scott: You have the phone in your pocket with the wire going into the pocket and under your coat as you walk around town,

93
00:04:34,522 --> 00:04:39,543
Rym: who in their good goddamn mind would use anything but earbuds for that purpose, particularly

94
00:04:40,326 --> 00:04:47,572
Scott: the wire on whether no matter what kind it is, earbud, headphone, whatever there's a wire and it is always fragile.

95
00:04:47,873 --> 00:04:51,508
Scott: And if it is, if you're using it in the studio, the fragile a wire is not a problem.

96
00:04:51,548 --> 00:04:56,410
Scott: If you're walking around town, no matter what kind, the fragile a wire becomes a problem.

97
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,716
Scott: That's why if you have the Dr.

98
00:04:57,776 --> 00:04:59,544
Scott: Dre kind, you can replace the wire.

99
00:04:59,564 --> 00:05:06,592
Rym: Otherwise you need to repair or I just got the slightly more expensive etymotic that are slightly less made of glass.

100
00:05:06,753 --> 00:05:11,415
Scott: What I really was looking into was getting some Bluetooth headphones because then this whole problem goes.

101
00:05:11,496 --> 00:05:13,567
Rym: actually Pete's got it going on because he's got the hearing aid.

102
00:05:13,627 --> 00:05:13,989
Rym: Exactly.

103
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:14,553
Rym: Got the box.

104
00:05:14,874 --> 00:05:16,442
Rym: The box is also way to DP.

105
00:05:16,543 --> 00:05:17,025
Scott: Exactly.

106
00:05:17,085 --> 00:05:20,801
Scott: So I was looking for a TV headphones at the ones that a modic used to make.

107
00:05:20,841 --> 00:05:22,045
Scott: They are discontinued.

108
00:05:22,265 --> 00:05:22,446
Rym: What?

109
00:05:22,486 --> 00:05:22,787
Rym: Really?

110
00:05:23,068 --> 00:05:29,831
Scott: And and nobody really makes any that are good now that are wireless Bluetooth headphones.

111
00:05:30,473 --> 00:05:31,417
Rym: I guess there was never much.

112
00:05:31,437 --> 00:05:34,629
Scott: There's a few out there, but I guess here's my suspicion.

113
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:35,011
Rym: Why?

114
00:05:35,151 --> 00:05:36,577
Rym: They're all there without the wire.

115
00:05:36,597 --> 00:05:37,902
Rym: People lose them.

116
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:38,927
Scott: I don't know.

117
00:05:39,148 --> 00:05:42,083
Scott: But they're all headsets for douchebags, you know, so you can talk on the phone.

118
00:05:42,103 --> 00:05:44,595
Scott: But none of them are headphones with the stereo sound.

119
00:05:44,856 --> 00:05:45,198
Scott: Really?

120
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:46,282
Scott: There's a few, but they all suck.

121
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:47,928
Rym: Yeah, that's how it goes.

122
00:05:48,309 --> 00:05:50,256
Rym: Thing is, who uses a phone to talk?

123
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:52,567
Scott: The thing is, it would be really cool, right?

124
00:05:52,627 --> 00:05:55,582
Scott: Imagine having, you know, like you wouldn't need to have the wire.

125
00:05:55,622 --> 00:06:01,445
Scott: What I would like to have is the two in earbuds within like a plastic half circle sort of connecting.

126
00:06:01,465 --> 00:06:02,450
Scott: They can go behind my head.

127
00:06:02,992 --> 00:06:05,363
Scott: I want a sort of like backwards sunglasses.

128
00:06:05,443 --> 00:06:07,733
Rym: I want a modern advanced neural input.

129
00:06:07,753 --> 00:06:08,877
Rym: that just obviously.

130
00:06:08,898 --> 00:06:09,118
Scott: Yes.

131
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:16,136
Scott: But then to take them off, I can just put them on my neck and then put them back up and then on the neck like that, you know, just like real headphones, but not gigantic.

132
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,644
Scott: And they would be Bluetooth wireless.

133
00:06:17,684 --> 00:06:19,313
Scott: That's what my ideal product.

134
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:23,111
Rym: My ideal product would be a little step further if I guess I'm going to Google Glass and all that stuff.

135
00:06:23,513 --> 00:06:23,835
Rym: I want.

136
00:06:23,855 --> 00:06:25,803
Rym: Where is that, by the way?

137
00:06:25,864 --> 00:06:28,995
Rym: Some day I want earbuds that I stick in that are complete isolation.

138
00:06:29,016 --> 00:06:41,886
Rym: So and have little mechanical controls so that I can basically turn them into actual earplugs or listening to music in isolation or listening to stuff, but also hearing the real world or just hearing the real world.

139
00:06:41,907 --> 00:06:43,780
Scott: Well, the way to hear the real world, right, is etymotic.

140
00:06:44,021 --> 00:06:46,530
Scott: actually has this app on the iPhone called.

141
00:06:46,891 --> 00:06:48,015
Rym: I saw the awareness.

142
00:06:48,176 --> 00:06:50,606
Scott: And what it does is you put the etymotic in your ears.

143
00:06:50,626 --> 00:06:52,013
Scott: You can't hear anything but the music.

144
00:06:52,394 --> 00:06:55,387
Scott: But sometimes you do want to be aware of the outside world.

145
00:06:55,468 --> 00:07:17,937
Scott: So you enable the awareness app and it actually uses the microphone on your phone or the microphone that's near your face on your phone to hear the outside world and then put that into your ear with but keeping it lower than the thing that you're listening to, you know, in the proper proportions so that you can be aware of the outside world while protecting your ears, while listening to music.

146
00:07:17,977 --> 00:07:28,071
Rym: There are actually while being aware HCI terms for those sorts of like barriers of interaction between or feedback, like barriers between you and direct feedback.

147
00:07:29,076 --> 00:07:35,000
Rym: It's analogous to the difference between like rack and pinion steering or completely electronic steering and all those kinds of things.

148
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:36,081
Rym: Only for ears.

149
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:37,823
Rym: But anyway, book club.

150
00:07:37,863 --> 00:07:38,524
Rym: We'll get right to that.

151
00:07:38,564 --> 00:07:47,758
Rym: But first, things of your mom, things of Scott's mom.

152
00:07:50,425 --> 00:07:51,688
Rym: Oh, my God, I'm logged into my phone.

153
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:52,570
Rym: Who's calling me?

154
00:07:54,272 --> 00:07:54,932
Rym: Screen this call.

155
00:07:57,995 --> 00:08:00,077
Scott: OK, OK, sure.

156
00:08:00,778 --> 00:08:01,158
Scott: All right.

157
00:08:01,478 --> 00:08:02,700
Scott: Let us check this thing of the day.

158
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,450
Scott: Apparently in the UK, we missed the boat.

159
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,660
Scott: There was a sketch comedy show that I never heard of.

160
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,316
Scott: And someone from the UK is probably like, oh, my God, never heard of that.

161
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:17,004
Scott: Well, they probably never heard of the state or kids in the halls or whatever called the Mitchell and Webb situation.

162
00:08:18,007 --> 00:08:20,816
Scott: And this is from, you know, the 2000s.

163
00:08:21,157 --> 00:08:25,289
Scott: Actually, this is uploaded to YouTube in 07.

164
00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:27,876
Scott: And it's a very funny sketch about farming.

165
00:08:28,036 --> 00:08:31,266
Scott: And it's really hilarious and it kind of makes me want to be a farmer.

166
00:08:31,286 --> 00:08:34,015
Scott: And it's funny.

167
00:08:34,095 --> 00:08:35,881
Scott: Then it's only a minute and a half long.

168
00:08:35,922 --> 00:08:36,364
Scott: So watch it.

169
00:08:36,585 --> 00:08:44,000
Rym: It's about the same level as like one step under the really good white as kids, you know, stuff, but way above the mediocre white as kids, you know, stuff.

170
00:08:44,761 --> 00:08:46,285
Rym: It's analogous to kids in the hall.

171
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:46,987
Rym: I think I agree.

172
00:08:47,087 --> 00:08:52,744
Rym: Based on the one skit I saw, the nothing beats Lincoln.

173
00:08:52,804 --> 00:08:54,069
Scott: What do you mean?

174
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:54,370
Scott: Lincoln?

175
00:08:54,611 --> 00:08:54,852
Scott: Lincoln?

176
00:08:54,892 --> 00:08:55,113
Rym: What?

177
00:08:55,394 --> 00:08:55,756
Rym: Okay.

178
00:08:55,816 --> 00:08:56,017
Rym: What?

179
00:08:56,439 --> 00:08:56,619
Scott: What?

180
00:08:58,882 --> 00:09:06,883
Rym: So you guys may not be aware of this, but a long time ago there was a musical called Les Miserables.

181
00:09:07,325 --> 00:09:07,646
Rym: No.

182
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:11,298
Rym: Now wall is an obvious and very not from that long ago.

183
00:09:11,499 --> 00:09:12,261
Rym: Very big musical.

184
00:09:12,883 --> 00:09:14,608
Rym: It's from a while ago in that.

185
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:18,138
Rym: Where has it been touring recently?

186
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:19,182
Scott: You can go see it in places.

187
00:09:19,444 --> 00:09:20,248
Rym: Yeah, not everywhere.

188
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:25,573
Rym: It's not like when I was a kid where it was in like every town and there were multiple international tours.

189
00:09:25,613 --> 00:09:29,732
Rym: I saw him is like three times in the nineties and the official website.

190
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:30,335
Scott: Let's see where it's.

191
00:09:30,355 --> 00:09:36,803
Rym: So anyway, my thing of the day is that if you weren't aware, there's a movie based on Les Mis coming, you know, there's trailers for it.

192
00:09:36,823 --> 00:09:38,389
Rym: I actually saw the trailer during wreck at Ralph.

193
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:50,913
Rym: But the thing is, unlike the movie versions of Les Mis that just try to follow either the book or the plot of the musical, it's more of an actual musical that happens to be a movie.

194
00:09:51,756 --> 00:09:53,662
Rym: I really dig musicals as movies.

195
00:09:53,722 --> 00:09:57,397
Rym: So the trailer gave me those goosebumps of, oh, it's going to be good.

196
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:00,409
Scott: You can see it right now in Chicago starting tomorrow.

197
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,192
Rym: All right.

198
00:10:01,694 --> 00:10:02,697
Scott: Until December 2nd.

199
00:10:02,798 --> 00:10:03,239
Scott: Not bad.

200
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,827
Scott: Then it's going to Kansas City, then

201
00:10:04,867 --> 00:10:05,309
Scott: D.C.,

202
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,479
Scott: then Philly, then Pittsburgh, then Kalamazoo.

203
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,302
Rym: So now New York.

204
00:10:08,382 --> 00:10:11,169
Scott: Charlotte, Miami, Fort Myers.

205
00:10:11,429 --> 00:10:12,091
Scott: Wait, hold on.

206
00:10:12,592 --> 00:10:13,033
Rym: I'm holding.

207
00:10:14,136 --> 00:10:15,760
Scott: Schenectady, April 30th, 2013.

208
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,402
Scott: Rochester, May 7th, 2013.

209
00:10:16,402 --> 00:10:16,703
Scott: There you go.

210
00:10:16,723 --> 00:10:24,784
Scott: New Haven, April 17th, Baltimore, Richmond, big cities.

211
00:10:25,005 --> 00:10:25,466
Rym: Not bad.

212
00:10:25,707 --> 00:10:31,269
Scott: It's on tours from now until they got dates all the way up to June 9th, 2013.

213
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:33,780
Rym: I just got to realize I was chatting with Les Mis dot com.

214
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,483
Scott: LESMIS.

215
00:10:34,563 --> 00:10:37,500
Rym: I was chatting with random listeners because the Counter-Strike server and everything.

216
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,719
Rym: and Les Mis came up and I realized a lot of people have never actually seen it.

217
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:42,387
Scott: Look at the coat on that master of the house, yo.

218
00:10:42,428 --> 00:10:44,136
Scott: Wait, it disappeared.

219
00:10:44,337 --> 00:10:45,362
Scott: They got a rotating image going on here.

220
00:10:45,382 --> 00:10:46,687
Rym: I saw the same image you saw.

221
00:10:46,707 --> 00:10:47,350
Rym: OK.

222
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,113
Scott: OK.

223
00:10:48,454 --> 00:10:51,126
Rym: So the name of the win was your book club selection.

224
00:10:51,347 --> 00:10:52,030
Scott: It was indeed.

225
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:52,834
Scott: So here's the story.

226
00:10:52,914 --> 00:10:57,051
Scott: I was reading the Penny Arcade print editions, you know, which I buy all of.

227
00:10:57,593 --> 00:11:01,067
Scott: And in one of them, there was an introduction and it was a pretty good introduction.

228
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:07,677
Scott: And in that introduction, the guy talked about how he was a fantasy author and Tycho read his books or something.

229
00:11:07,718 --> 00:11:08,802
Scott: I don't remember the details.

230
00:11:08,882 --> 00:11:12,413
Scott: All I remember is that at the end it said his name was Patrick Rothfuss.

231
00:11:13,557 --> 00:11:14,439
Rym: Rothfuss.

232
00:11:14,982 --> 00:11:18,620
Scott: I looked his ass up on the Internet because he wrote this introduction for Penny Arcade.

233
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,460
Scott: And I found out that he wrote this book called Name of the Wind and it was pretty popular.

234
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:26,488
Scott: And I was like, OK, that's good to know.

235
00:11:26,588 --> 00:11:28,336
Scott: I'll read that book some fucking day.

236
00:11:28,356 --> 00:11:31,250
Scott: And then the book started showing up all over the place.

237
00:11:31,331 --> 00:11:34,043
Scott: And I and I mentioned it like a whole bunch of people had read it.

238
00:11:34,144 --> 00:11:37,136
Scott: And I was like, oh, this is something I clearly escaped my radars.

239
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,665
Scott: Actually it didn't escape my radar.

240
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:52,599
Scott: It was just caught in it just now, at least at the time, just now, which was a long time ago because I bought the book at Amazon and had sat on my shelf, which is why I selected it as a book club book so I could read a book that I paid for instead of having to buy a new book.

241
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,647
Rym: So the usual warning.

242
00:11:54,687 --> 00:11:55,952
Rym: This is the GeekNights book club.

243
00:11:56,394 --> 00:12:00,550
Rym: We're assuming that you have already read The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss.

244
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,280
Rym: If not, we're going to spoil a bunch of stuff.

245
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,392
Scott: It is a fantasy novel of the typical nature.

246
00:12:07,155 --> 00:12:08,761
Rym: So without further ado, what do you think of it?

247
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,007
Rym: Because honestly, I liked it.

248
00:12:11,388 --> 00:12:16,245
Rym: OK, but I started the second book and got about a third of the way through it.

249
00:12:16,688 --> 00:12:22,539
Rym: And now that I know that doesn't fucking go anywhere, I really like my opinion of the first book has gone down quite a bit.

250
00:12:23,261 --> 00:12:24,347
Scott: Well, I mean, I'm not going to change.

251
00:12:24,407 --> 00:12:24,910
Scott: I haven't read.

252
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:25,815
Scott: I have the second book.

253
00:12:26,177 --> 00:12:27,302
Scott: I have not read any of it.

254
00:12:27,322 --> 00:12:29,171
Rym: Yeah, but I'm not going through.

255
00:12:29,211 --> 00:12:30,758
Rym: He's still in fucking school.

256
00:12:30,798 --> 00:12:31,863
Rym: He doesn't have any money.

257
00:12:31,883 --> 00:12:34,134
Rym: And then he pisses off the person to lend him money.

258
00:12:34,395 --> 00:12:36,887
Rym: And then someone uses like malfeasance against some bullshit.

259
00:12:36,907 --> 00:12:39,257
Scott: Yeah, I'm not going to modify my opinion.

260
00:12:39,518 --> 00:12:40,824
Rym: And then he gets his loot back.

261
00:12:40,945 --> 00:12:45,224
Scott: I'm not going to modify my opinion of the first book because of something in the second book.

262
00:12:45,344 --> 00:12:47,875
Scott: I will, because now that is not legit.

263
00:12:47,895 --> 00:12:48,015
Scott: Right.

264
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:52,670
Scott: That's like saying, man, you know, Mega Man 2 sucks because Mega Man 3 wasn't as good.

265
00:12:53,152 --> 00:13:03,523
Rym: But if Mega Man 2 had been like ended with a story that clearly continued, it was like to be continued like Wiley gets away at the end.

266
00:13:03,543 --> 00:13:05,110
Rym: And then the next game sucked.

267
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:08,244
Scott: Well, that means Mega Man 3 suck doesn't mean Mega Man 2 suck.

268
00:13:08,464 --> 00:13:12,438
Rym: Ah, but remember, this book is part of a defined like pre hoc.

269
00:13:12,478 --> 00:13:22,497
Scott: Well, yes, if I'm going to give a value judgment of the whole series as a whole, then, of course, the you know, all of the books together affect each other in that some judgment.

270
00:13:22,537 --> 00:13:26,655
Scott: But if I'm judging only book one, book two and three got nothing to do with.

271
00:13:26,735 --> 00:13:35,924
Rym: Ah, but I was judging book one under the assumption that the plot that the trilogy is a contiguous plot and it actually is a contiguous plot.

272
00:13:35,985 --> 00:13:37,511
Rym: It's just one goddamn book.

273
00:13:37,712 --> 00:13:38,074
Rym: There isn't.

274
00:13:38,154 --> 00:13:40,584
Rym: the only reason it's a trilogy is for publishing reasons.

275
00:13:40,906 --> 00:13:42,633
Scott: And also because it would be really quite large.

276
00:13:43,175 --> 00:13:53,828
Rym: I have necessarily I have a copy of Kamara's Copper Serpent, Silver Dragon's Gold, some bullshit Piers Anthony book that's like that thick.

277
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,176
Scott: That's almost as thick as it would be.

278
00:13:56,557 --> 00:13:57,400
Rym: It is ridiculous.

279
00:13:57,641 --> 00:14:02,382
Scott: And I mean, I had you know, did you actually get the digital or physical version of book two of this?

280
00:14:02,763 --> 00:14:04,730
Rym: Of course, digital of both.

281
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,315
Scott: I saw the physical ones.

282
00:14:06,616 --> 00:14:07,780
Scott: Why would I buy a second?

283
00:14:07,941 --> 00:14:09,329
Scott: one is bigger than the first one.

284
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:11,220
Scott: The third one's probably going to be bigger than that.

285
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,325
Scott: Knowing fantasy people.

286
00:14:12,365 --> 00:14:12,907
Rym: Good God.

287
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,338
Scott: Anyway, so let's just talk about the first book.

288
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,845
Scott: OK, so the name of the wind.

289
00:14:16,885 --> 00:14:18,272
Rym: It's about we don't we?

290
00:14:18,533 --> 00:14:19,518
Rym: But everyone's read it.

291
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,066
Rym: We don't need to talk about what it's about.

292
00:14:21,086 --> 00:14:23,478
Scott: There are some people listening who have not read it.

293
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:24,101
Scott: Fuck you.

294
00:14:24,282 --> 00:14:28,756
Rym: OK, it's about a young boy who is the most perfect, best person ever.

295
00:14:29,137 --> 00:14:32,388
Rym: He was born to a great family with awesome parents.

296
00:14:32,588 --> 00:14:35,036
Rym: He's smarter than everyone.

297
00:14:35,096 --> 00:14:38,809
Rym: Yeah, he's the smartest, most talented kid who have ever been born.

298
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:45,920
Rym: He's a goddamn Mary Sue and everything's perfect, except he sucks at flirting with women and he lives in a world of high school drama.

299
00:14:46,921 --> 00:14:47,925
Rym: That's what it's about.

300
00:14:47,945 --> 00:14:50,234
Rym: Oh, and his parents were killed by the Shandrian.

301
00:14:50,615 --> 00:14:50,856
Scott: Yep.

302
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:59,087
Scott: So that's really, you know, it's one of those situations, like a lot of fantasy things, where there's this big bad guy, this Shandrian.

303
00:14:59,168 --> 00:15:06,451
Rym: It has to be Shandrian, otherwise the poems that he's referred to a few times, he rhymes Shandrian with plan.

304
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,900
Rym: OK, so unless it's plan, then it's Shandrian.

305
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,623
Scott: Well, it could be Shandrian.

306
00:15:12,265 --> 00:15:13,829
Rym: Plan, Shandrian.

307
00:15:13,849 --> 00:15:16,736
Rym: You don't say plan, you say plan.

308
00:15:16,757 --> 00:15:19,946
Scott: It could be Shandrian at the end.

309
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:21,232
Scott: There's two different A's in there.

310
00:15:21,313 --> 00:15:22,780
Scott: It could also be Shandrian.

311
00:15:23,782 --> 00:15:24,806
Rym: I think they're evil enough.

312
00:15:24,826 --> 00:15:26,352
Rym: Let's give them two Scranton A's.

313
00:15:26,613 --> 00:15:27,135
Scott: Sure, whatever.

314
00:15:27,155 --> 00:15:28,781
Scott: It doesn't fucking matter.

315
00:15:28,822 --> 00:15:33,339
Scott: What does matter is that you sort of care about what the hell their fucking deal is.

316
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,667
Scott: It's like a group of bad guys in each one.

317
00:15:35,928 --> 00:15:39,099
Scott: Like when one guy is nearby, all the fire turns blue.

318
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,573
Scott: And when the other guy is nearby, like you hear weird noises.

319
00:15:42,593 --> 00:15:46,929
Scott: Well, what I kind of enjoy is these sort of the other guys nearby, all metal gets rusty.

320
00:15:47,852 --> 00:15:50,180
Rym: But it's the piecing to get like the plot.

321
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:55,962
Rym: This is one of those situations of the proper nouns and the actual overall story is something I think is pretty cool.

322
00:15:56,003 --> 00:15:56,745
Rym: I'm interested in.

323
00:15:57,127 --> 00:16:05,199
Rym: There's a sort of precursor civilization and precursor magic, you know, the great days of tarpaulin, the great stars swirled the bearded away in the past.

324
00:16:05,219 --> 00:16:12,871
Scott: That stuff isn't even that far in the past, but it's been largely forgotten and it's only like in tales and stuff like The Burning Wheel and stuff like that.

325
00:16:12,952 --> 00:16:20,459
Scott: It's like, you know, relatively recent history, just some perhaps centuries ago, is now like legendary, even though it's totally true.

326
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:26,401
Scott: But you don't know what is totally true because, you know, they don't have a good record of history at all.

327
00:16:26,461 --> 00:16:29,851
Scott: And you're basically just hearing from bards in the story.

328
00:16:29,952 --> 00:16:33,101
Scott: And then the story is itself a story.

329
00:16:33,162 --> 00:16:38,760
Scott: You know, it's just what the main character in the present is telling to this chronicler.

330
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,105
Scott: So how reliable is he?

331
00:16:40,547 --> 00:16:40,808
Scott: Right.

332
00:16:40,868 --> 00:16:43,459
Scott: How do you know how much of what he is saying is totally true?

333
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:46,856
Rym: If this book ends with him being the leader of the chandler and it's all a big sham.

334
00:16:46,896 --> 00:16:48,404
Scott: Well, no, I can guarantee you.

335
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,570
Scott: I don't know if that's the case.

336
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,383
Rym: That would be great if he's an evil wizard and he's lying.

337
00:16:52,403 --> 00:16:55,315
Scott: But I do know that he's definitely unreliable narrator.

338
00:16:55,335 --> 00:16:55,476
Scott: Right.

339
00:16:55,496 --> 00:16:57,321
Scott: You cannot trust that everything he is saying.

340
00:16:57,462 --> 00:16:58,804
Rym: I don't get that impression.

341
00:16:58,904 --> 00:16:59,244
Rym: I get the.

342
00:16:59,465 --> 00:17:13,934
Rym: So Patrick Rothfuss, I get the impression that they're written from it reads like a young adult novel.

343
00:17:14,454 --> 00:17:21,837
Rym: I have absolutely zero suspicion that there is anything in the retelling that is not the literal truth.

344
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:24,587
Rym: I don't think he's going for a story like that at all.

345
00:17:24,727 --> 00:17:37,350
Rym: I think is I don't really because the rest of the book is written in a kind of I don't want to say novice, but it's written or amateurish, but it's really young adult, really straightforward.

346
00:17:37,691 --> 00:17:39,597
Rym: There's very little subtlety.

347
00:17:39,657 --> 00:17:40,440
Scott: I disagree.

348
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:45,798
Rym: There is no subtlety at any level in the level of writing the diction.

349
00:17:45,838 --> 00:17:46,962
Rym: I'm not even talking about the story.

350
00:17:47,003 --> 00:17:48,149
Rym: I'm talking about all the other elements.

351
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:48,954
Scott: I agree with that.

352
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,678
Scott: But I'm still.

353
00:17:49,699 --> 00:17:53,433
Scott: I still think that he is not 100 percent reliable in his.

354
00:17:53,654 --> 00:17:54,738
Scott: you know, what he is telling.

355
00:17:54,778 --> 00:17:58,573
Scott: that chronicler is not the 100 percent, quote, truth in that fantasy world.

356
00:17:58,653 --> 00:17:59,517
Rym: I'm not going to give.

357
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:02,067
Rym: I really don't think I see no evidence of that.

358
00:18:03,051 --> 00:18:07,129
Rym: Just from the way the book is written, I don't feel like the author even considered doing something like that.

359
00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:08,073
Scott: All right.

360
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:08,695
Scott: Well, we'll see.

361
00:18:08,997 --> 00:18:16,610
Scott: Seriously, if you start reading the next book and you see where this is going, it's well, you know, we have a book and two thirds to find out if that's the case.

362
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,943
Scott: But that is that is my suspicion of what is going on here.

363
00:18:20,144 --> 00:18:22,755
Rym: Also, the fact that there's it's a little sloppy.

364
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:33,326
Rym: This is why I don't believe he's doing anything like that in that the retelling occasionally will edge toward the character kind of saying like, no, it was like this or like this.

365
00:18:33,828 --> 00:18:45,828
Rym: But then it always lapses into a sort of narrative as though that is the book itself, like the way it is written implies that the author is not putting care into making the distinction.

366
00:18:46,872 --> 00:18:50,605
Rym: That is why I do not suspect that he's going to do anything clever like that anyway.

367
00:18:51,549 --> 00:19:00,623
Scott: But yeah, I do agree with you that, you know, while like the story, you know, is sort of interesting and, you know, different parts of it, you end up caring or not caring about.

368
00:19:01,005 --> 00:19:01,206
Scott: Right.

369
00:19:01,226 --> 00:19:02,872
Scott: He really just sort of.

370
00:19:02,912 --> 00:19:06,526
Scott: you know, the biggest problem overall is the sort of spinning of the wheels.

371
00:19:06,807 --> 00:19:07,048
Scott: Right.

372
00:19:07,108 --> 00:19:08,935
Rym: It's like not even the burning wheels.

373
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:11,184
Scott: No, the burning wheels spinning is the good part.

374
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:11,505
Rym: I know.

375
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:16,786
Scott: Why can't the whole book be that the bad part is, you know, he gets he's in a situation.

376
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:17,127
Scott: Right.

377
00:19:17,187 --> 00:19:18,632
Scott: And things are moving along.

378
00:19:19,395 --> 00:19:25,880
Scott: And, you know, so for example, he's went at the part where he's poor in that city and he can't escape the life of being a street urchin.

379
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,341
Scott: Right.

380
00:19:28,147 --> 00:19:34,668
Scott: You know, it's he basically has these problems of being a street urchin and he runs into the same problems over and over again.

381
00:19:34,748 --> 00:19:38,803
Scott: And, you know, he succeeds in getting some help and maybe moving out.

382
00:19:38,863 --> 00:19:40,069
Scott: And then, no, he doesn't.

383
00:19:40,129 --> 00:19:40,852
Scott: And then he does.

384
00:19:40,912 --> 00:19:41,515
Scott: And he doesn't.

385
00:19:41,575 --> 00:19:44,306
Scott: And it's like, how long are you going to go back and forth?

386
00:19:44,346 --> 00:19:45,009
Scott: You know, it's like.

387
00:19:45,772 --> 00:19:49,486
Scott: and the thing is, it would be OK if it was like, you know, something different.

388
00:19:49,527 --> 00:19:49,727
Scott: Right.

389
00:19:49,767 --> 00:19:54,768
Scott: Like in Burning Wheel, you let it you let it ride when you try one way of solving a problem.

390
00:19:54,848 --> 00:19:55,913
Rym: Oh, I'll go one step further.

391
00:19:55,933 --> 00:20:03,282
Rym: In Burning Wheel, if you fail your resources test every time you fail it, different bullshit happens, not the exact same bullshit.

392
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:13,400
Scott: It's like if you if you want to have him fail or succeed with a particular problem, OK, the next part of the book should be a different problem with a different solution, not I have no money.

393
00:20:13,501 --> 00:20:14,470
Scott: I try to get money.

394
00:20:14,772 --> 00:20:15,539
Scott: I don't get money.

395
00:20:16,284 --> 00:20:17,112
Scott: I have no money.

396
00:20:17,193 --> 00:20:17,980
Scott: I try to get money.

397
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,012
Scott: I still have no money.

398
00:20:19,033 --> 00:20:19,478
Scott: Right.

399
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:31,300
Scott: And it's like he just keeps trying multiple times in slightly different ways with very crook, slightly so differences between before actually moving forward to the next part.

400
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,800
Rym: So I think so.

401
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:38,922
Scott: And then when he gets to the magic school, then that becomes the book just fucking ends when it's magic school.

402
00:20:39,063 --> 00:20:39,243
Rym: Yeah.

403
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:47,920
Scott: And then it gets into the sort of the three way cycle of, you know, the needs money, money, girl and academics, the trifecta.

404
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,640
Rym: And now this is where the book lost me.

405
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,703
Scott: Yeah, it's good.

406
00:20:50,763 --> 00:20:57,540
Scott: All three of those things are good on their own, but he cycles between the three things, repeating at least three or four times.

407
00:20:57,701 --> 00:20:57,962
Scott: Yeah.

408
00:20:58,002 --> 00:20:58,464
Rym: You know what?

409
00:20:58,685 --> 00:21:05,200
Scott: And it's like you should have dealt with each one of those things once and then maybe bring one of them back at the end to be like, oh, shit.

410
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:05,621
Rym: Right.

411
00:21:05,661 --> 00:21:14,160
Rym: So this is indicative of a much sort of deeper fundamental problem, which is why I really this is a young adult fantasy novel is this is nowhere.

412
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,502
Rym: It's a lot of elements of it are fun in the same way that the lives of Locke Lammer are really fun.

413
00:21:19,542 --> 00:21:23,259
Scott: But at least Locke Lammer doesn't, you know, doesn't spin like that move.

414
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,965
Rym: So what what this?

415
00:21:25,206 --> 00:21:25,928
Rym: the elegance?

416
00:21:25,949 --> 00:21:27,474
Rym: what's happening in this book is?

417
00:21:27,514 --> 00:21:34,660
Rym: it does what I've called for many years myself, the proper noun march where Prince and nothing has a proper noun.

418
00:21:35,121 --> 00:21:35,847
Rym: No, it does not.

419
00:21:35,988 --> 00:21:37,359
Rym: It has proper nouns.

420
00:21:37,742 --> 00:21:38,487
Scott: A lot more.

421
00:21:38,527 --> 00:21:40,259
Scott: Yes, it has a lot more proper nouns.

422
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:46,600
Rym: The proper noun march has nothing to do with the number or extent of proper nouns in a book.

423
00:21:46,761 --> 00:21:47,104
Rym: All right.

424
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:48,559
Rym: The proper noun march.

425
00:21:49,281 --> 00:21:49,986
Rym: Here's an example.

426
00:21:50,349 --> 00:21:51,740
Rym: He joins the school, right?

427
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,904
Rym: He gets into the university.

428
00:21:52,924 --> 00:21:59,240
Rym: That is huge climax where he proves that he's a boy genius prodigy and the arcanist take the board.

429
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,425
Rym: You know, the masters take this unprecedented step of giving him a tuition of less three talents.

430
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,020
Scott: That was pretty clever.

431
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:06,542
Scott: I like that.

432
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:10,600
Rym: So that's immediately forgotten the next term around.

433
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,534
Rym: And he has to pay like four or five talents to.

434
00:22:12,756 --> 00:22:13,279
Scott: I know that.

435
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:13,841
Scott: Yeah.

436
00:22:14,283 --> 00:22:17,620
Rym: So but the fact that it was this huge deal.

437
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,384
Rym: Oh, my God.

438
00:22:18,485 --> 00:22:19,813
Rym: This kid is going.

439
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:20,920
Rym: he's like he's a prodigy.

440
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,799
Rym: He's going to go to the wizard school.

441
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,579
Rym: Jesus fucking Christ.

442
00:22:25,561 --> 00:22:30,018
Rym: And then immediately, oh, well, you're not an arcanist yet or you're not in L.A.

443
00:22:30,078 --> 00:22:30,259
Rym: yet.

444
00:22:31,003 --> 00:22:32,600
Rym: Oh, you're not a real are yet.

445
00:22:32,981 --> 00:22:33,645
Rym: Oh, and you know what?

446
00:22:34,027 --> 00:22:36,600
Rym: There are more levels beyond that that I've progressed through.

447
00:22:37,001 --> 00:22:37,222
Scott: Yeah.

448
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:48,182
Rym: He progresses through so many proper nouns of wizard bullshit, none of which are mentioned ever or Chekhov until it's time to use them like I want to use this kind of magic.

449
00:22:48,342 --> 00:22:51,380
Rym: Oh, well, you need to be an L fuck yourself before you can do that.

450
00:22:51,741 --> 00:22:59,582
Scott: Yeah, I think, you know, the best wizard school story I've ever read was, you know, the first book of Earthsea where the wizard school is actually only a small portion of the book.

451
00:22:59,905 --> 00:23:01,700
Scott: But these stories, they tell of the wizard school.

452
00:23:02,042 --> 00:23:03,737
Rym: Ah, now this would have been fine to see.

453
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,323
Scott: He shows up at the front of the wizard school and is the challenge with the guy with the door.

454
00:23:08,363 --> 00:23:08,727
Scott: Remember?

455
00:23:08,767 --> 00:23:10,000
Scott: And he's got it right.

456
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,360
Scott: And then on the way out, there's the doorman again, sealing the wizards.

457
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:13,681
Scott: Right.

458
00:23:13,741 --> 00:23:17,540
Scott: And that's you know, that is really the awesomeness.

459
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:22,624
Rym: Now, this could have had the same thing if it had just been about the wizard school, like that was the plot.

460
00:23:22,664 --> 00:23:25,880
Rym: Like, here's the story of a dude who went through wizard school.

461
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,261
Scott: Right.

462
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:26,684
Scott: It's not.

463
00:23:26,724 --> 00:23:29,100
Scott: It's like there's a guy and his story is elsewhere.

464
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:37,480
Scott: His story is with this Shandrian and what the how did he get to this bar with this, you know, demon companion and these rock spiders and this this whole world.

465
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:45,080
Scott: And clearly this guy is a really important, you know, awesome wizard character in this world at the present time, not like an ancient history.

466
00:23:45,161 --> 00:23:45,282
Scott: Right.

467
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:46,820
Scott: Like he's still a badass, supposedly.

468
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:52,692
Rym: But if I graph the percentage of time in the book spent on different things, it's mostly teen angst.

469
00:23:53,037 --> 00:23:53,200
Scott: Yeah.

470
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,660
Rym: It's mostly wizard school angst and like, oh, my God, he was a jerk to me.

471
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:01,763
Rym: So I'm going to pull a prank on him and it's going to escalate until someone tries to kill someone.

472
00:24:01,843 --> 00:24:01,983
Scott: Yeah.

473
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:11,919
Scott: And it's like what kind of, you know, you know, epic, awesome, important guy is so shallow, teen angst, revenge, right?

474
00:24:12,901 --> 00:24:19,599
Scott: It's like that is not what, you know, the awesome wizard of the land is supposed to act and it makes you know that makes you not like him.

475
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:19,961
Scott: Right.

476
00:24:19,981 --> 00:24:20,446
Scott: It's like I like.

477
00:24:20,587 --> 00:24:21,919
Scott: Now, that would be fine.

478
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,404
Rym: I like these other characters more if that was also a plot that was resolved or something interesting happened with it.

479
00:24:27,444 --> 00:24:35,183
Rym: But the fact that the book doesn't use those as like an example of something that shaped him or an example of him being a dumb kid, it just revels in it.

480
00:24:35,705 --> 00:24:39,700
Rym: It revels like that, like this is the primary conflict for all these years.

481
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:43,320
Rym: The book basically moves at a pretty quick pace.

482
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,540
Rym: The story moves quickly until wizard school.

483
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,430
Rym: And then wizard school is just.

484
00:24:47,632 --> 00:24:48,559
Rym: it's like a different book.

485
00:24:49,042 --> 00:24:51,920
Scott: Yeah, it's like it gets mired in the wizard school.

486
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,280
Scott: It's like, yeah, you're still brand from the archives.

487
00:24:55,681 --> 00:25:00,920
Rym: So the proper now in March gets a little bit worse in that problems will be raised.

488
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:06,055
Rym: And then the solution to the problems is almost always a proper noun.

489
00:25:06,958 --> 00:25:09,639
Rym: that was the hitherto never foreshadowed or mentioned.

490
00:25:11,361 --> 00:25:13,240
Scott: And yeah, like I need money.

491
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:17,400
Scott: Well, the solution is apparently there's this lending money lady in town.

492
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:22,380
Rym: The Prince of Nothing says the word Dunyane in the beginning and keeps using it consistently throughout.

493
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:27,460
Rym: This picks up and drops proper nouns as are necessary and to seal it off.

494
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,460
Rym: I'm complaining a lot, but I'm not saying it's a bad book.

495
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,279
Rym: Proper noun March culminates.

496
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,000
Rym: The thing that pisses me off the most.

497
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:44,560
Scott: Well, the reason, you know, whenever you complain like this and you and then you go to say this is not, you know, whenever you have any sort of media that you complain a lot about, but you go, but you also just sort of make an offhand remark like you like it.

498
00:25:44,601 --> 00:25:45,223
Scott: It's not bad.

499
00:25:45,564 --> 00:25:50,400
Scott: That's because it is a thing that has good parts and has flaws.

500
00:25:50,621 --> 00:25:57,900
Scott: And in and in those cases, there's the more to complain about than if something sucks, because if something sucks, you can just say this fucking sucks.

501
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,588
Scott: Don't watch it.

502
00:25:58,629 --> 00:25:59,055
Scott: Don't read it.

503
00:25:59,116 --> 00:25:59,299
Scott: Right.

504
00:25:59,681 --> 00:26:01,519
Scott: But you have a lot of complaints like this.

505
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:09,745
Scott: It's because there was a potential for greatness that was ruined because of a major flaw or two.

506
00:26:09,785 --> 00:26:15,660
Rym: Not even ruined, because as much as I am like, oh, my God, this fucking school, it's like I was just about to put down the second book.

507
00:26:15,761 --> 00:26:15,963
Rym: Right.

508
00:26:16,004 --> 00:26:16,511
Rym: I was like, you know what?

509
00:26:16,551 --> 00:26:17,159
Rym: I'm done with this.

510
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,005
Rym: Yeah.

511
00:26:18,226 --> 00:26:20,600
Rym: And then malfeasance came out of nowhere.

512
00:26:20,741 --> 00:26:20,983
Scott: Yeah.

513
00:26:21,365 --> 00:26:23,420
Rym: And I was like, oh, let's see where this goes.

514
00:26:23,723 --> 00:26:25,340
Rym: And then that just got resolved.

515
00:26:26,163 --> 00:26:27,860
Rym: And now we can't pay tuition like Jesus.

516
00:26:28,162 --> 00:26:28,505
Rym: Jesus.

517
00:26:28,969 --> 00:26:30,260
Rym: Oh, God.

518
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,261
Scott: But yeah.

519
00:26:32,003 --> 00:26:33,708
Rym: So but so what I was getting?

520
00:26:33,728 --> 00:26:46,579
Rym: the thing that pisses me off the most and it's bothering me to the point that I almost can't read the book anymore is that these proper nouns are brought up and used and dropped all the time.

521
00:26:46,964 --> 00:26:48,380
Rym: But he does this particular thing.

522
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:55,740
Rym: I don't know if there's a word for this technique, but I see it in so many bad books that it feels out of place and stands in stark contrast in this book.

523
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,880
Scott: Are you talking about where he says exactly what's going to happen?

524
00:26:58,281 --> 00:26:59,439
Scott: Oh, no, I love that.

525
00:26:59,560 --> 00:26:59,942
Scott: Okay.

526
00:27:00,042 --> 00:27:02,733
Rym: I love that when he's like there's a part in the.

527
00:27:03,214 --> 00:27:06,780
Scott: that is the major technique that I've seen used three or four in the early part of wizard school.

528
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,845
Rym: There's that paragraph.

529
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:11,265
Rym: There's a paragraph at the end of this chapter where everything was going really well for him.

530
00:27:11,325 --> 00:27:16,098
Rym: It was like, yeah, of course, eventually Ambrose tried to kill me and then I got kicked out of the school.

531
00:27:16,621 --> 00:27:20,239
Scott: But yeah, I didn't get expelled then and he tried to kill me.

532
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:24,200
Scott: And then, you know, I did get kicked out of school later.

533
00:27:24,301 --> 00:27:27,320
Scott: And it's like he tells you exactly what's going to happen.

534
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,405
Scott: But you don't know that can work.

535
00:27:28,425 --> 00:27:30,798
Scott: You don't know the how, why, what, when.

536
00:27:30,878 --> 00:27:31,884
Scott: you don't know any details.

537
00:27:31,944 --> 00:27:34,820
Scott: All you know is that this thing is going to happen for sure.

538
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,900
Scott: He is going to get kicked out of wizard school.

539
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:38,290
Scott: He says it for sure.

540
00:27:38,311 --> 00:27:39,480
Rym: That can be done really well.

541
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,746
Rym: Look at American beauty.

542
00:27:40,807 --> 00:27:45,139
Rym: It's not a spoiler to say the dude dies in the end because he tells you he dies in the end.

543
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:45,622
Scott: Exactly.

544
00:27:45,642 --> 00:27:48,539
Scott: The first season, even at the beginning of the book, he's pretty much.

545
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,660
Scott: he doesn't say it as explicitly, but he says his parents are going to get killed.

546
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,002
Scott: Right.

547
00:27:52,263 --> 00:27:56,002
Rym: You know, in so many words that are now that even sets up an interesting tension.

548
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:57,373
Rym: And then I was drawn in.

549
00:27:57,494 --> 00:27:58,320
Scott: his parents get killed.

550
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,420
Scott: But you don't know how what until it happens.

551
00:28:00,581 --> 00:28:02,580
Scott: And then it's like, oh, that's how it went down.

552
00:28:02,661 --> 00:28:04,119
Scott: And then it means something even more.

553
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,595
Scott: So, you know, that's it didn't matter that you knew that it was.

554
00:28:06,615 --> 00:28:07,280
Rym: that stuff is cool.

555
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:13,219
Rym: For example, once it once he implied you knew that something bad was going to happen to his parents and everything was going to change.

556
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:19,760
Rym: Innocuous events seemed really sinister and yet nothing bad happened for a while.

557
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,451
Rym: That's true.

558
00:28:20,512 --> 00:28:20,920
Scott: You never know.

559
00:28:21,021 --> 00:28:22,660
Scott: It's like now you're looking for something.

560
00:28:23,082 --> 00:28:26,440
Scott: So it's sort of like an alien when she's walking around and it's the cat.

561
00:28:27,182 --> 00:28:27,666
Scott: It's the cat.

562
00:28:27,686 --> 00:28:29,579
Scott: And then the alien doesn't even go jump out and go boo.

563
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,338
Scott: The alien is just right behind her going like.

564
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:33,920
Rym: So, no, that's not what bothers me.

565
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:48,219
Rym: What bothers me is when he will do this sort of snarky, self-indulgent thing of using proper nouns to make a pseudo clever point like he'll use pseudo like proper nouns to reference basically high school chemistry a lot.

566
00:28:49,341 --> 00:28:53,220
Rym: Or more importantly, in the music stuff, he will refer he'll do it.

567
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:58,860
Rym: There's a scene where he plays a really hard song, but he does it like flippantly and he plays a really easy song.

568
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:02,940
Rym: But he acts like it's this huge effort and does like this comedy routine at the end.

569
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,339
Rym: I forgot his pipes and all that stuff.

570
00:29:06,282 --> 00:29:10,560
Rym: But the way that is written just really rubbed me the wrong way.

571
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:19,600
Rym: It's like like he explains to me the reader after the fact, oh, you've probably never heard of this song, but this song is particularly known for being difficult.

572
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,279
Rym: It reeks of Montaigne's hedgehog.

573
00:29:22,521 --> 00:29:23,899
Scott: What's Montaigne's hedgehog?

574
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:25,520
Rym: You've read The Man Who Was Thursday.

575
00:29:26,741 --> 00:29:27,896
Rym: The Hedgehog of Montaigne.

576
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:37,982
Rym: OK, the Pig of Montaigne, although all those references of, you know, the false reference to something that isn't real, but seems very intellectual, the book does that a lot.

577
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:40,120
Rym: It'll reference, you know, I'm a musician.

578
00:29:40,702 --> 00:29:49,959
Rym: The way music is referred to reeks of someone who hasn't actually ever been a professional musician, but has a very romanticized ideal of it.

579
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:54,882
Rym: The way romance is portrayed reeks of someone who has only ever experienced high school romance.

580
00:29:55,224 --> 00:29:58,920
Scott: Well, I think what it is, is, you know, he's trying to show the how awesome.

581
00:30:00,684 --> 00:30:02,780
Scott: forget the main characters, Rick and both both.

582
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,646
Scott: Yeah, that's right.

583
00:30:04,048 --> 00:30:05,760
Scott: He's trying to show how awesome both is.

584
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:10,757
Scott: So if he's like if he wants to show you how awesome he is at playing music, that's not easy with no audio.

585
00:30:10,777 --> 00:30:10,939
Scott: Right.

586
00:30:11,302 --> 00:30:12,299
Scott: So or video.

587
00:30:12,841 --> 00:30:15,672
Scott: So he's got to pretty much describe it as difficult.

588
00:30:15,733 --> 00:30:20,200
Scott: somehow, you know, as you know, with words, how awesome is he at music?

589
00:30:20,843 --> 00:30:21,025
Scott: Right.

590
00:30:21,046 --> 00:30:22,360
Scott: So how would you write that?

591
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,840
Scott: And so, you know, I'm not a writer.

592
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,362
Scott: I don't know.

593
00:30:25,447 --> 00:30:28,520
Scott: So I do know that this is not the best way to do that.

594
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:38,300
Rym: And thus the proper noun March, whenever he needs to, whenever the author needs to make a clever point, he'll use he'll refer to a proper noun that has very little context.

595
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:49,365
Rym: Like you could you you cannot really grok the different properties of these different proper nouns of alcohol because they're used sort of flippantly to make these funny points.

596
00:30:49,405 --> 00:30:51,320
Scott: Yeah, it's like, well, like, you know, in terms of the music.

597
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:51,581
Scott: Right.

598
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:54,092
Scott: He has his his parents play this song.

599
00:30:54,112 --> 00:30:59,719
Scott: that is, you know, and when his parents are playing the song, he make he tells the history of the song and how hard it is.

600
00:31:00,101 --> 00:31:07,060
Scott: And then, of course, he just says, oh, and then both played the same song that has the same title, which is a proper noun, of course.

601
00:31:07,502 --> 00:31:07,804
Scott: Right.

602
00:31:08,065 --> 00:31:10,700
Scott: And then it's like, oh, that's the hard song the parents play.

603
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,786
Scott: This must be way hard.

604
00:31:11,927 --> 00:31:13,840
Scott: And he pulled it off with a string broken.

605
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:14,863
Scott: Whoa.

606
00:31:14,883 --> 00:31:19,964
Rym: But meanwhile, for example, take the Prince of Nothing, a lot more proper noun bullshit.

607
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:20,565
Scott: But it's not.

608
00:31:20,605 --> 00:31:29,959
Rym: those proper nouns are used continuously and contextually and but they're not used in a way to replace describing something.

609
00:31:31,601 --> 00:31:45,719
Rym: Here, I feel like Patrick Rothfuss too often will use a proper noun to replace having to actually describe something or to make a point that he couldn't otherwise make without setting a lot of other hooks up along the way.

610
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:48,758
Rym: That bothered me.

611
00:31:49,221 --> 00:31:52,520
Rym: So all those criticisms aside, I still enjoyed the book.

612
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:58,119
Rym: The only reason I feel less good about it is that having read a whole bunch of the second book is not fucking going anywhere.

613
00:31:59,222 --> 00:32:01,740
Scott: No, I haven't read the second book, so I don't know if it's going to go anywhere.

614
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,100
Scott: But really, you know, I think this is almost like a one piece situation, right?

615
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:09,660
Scott: Just replace the sort of fighting the fish man for 10 chapters.

616
00:32:10,381 --> 00:32:10,623
Scott: Right.

617
00:32:10,683 --> 00:32:20,800
Scott: And then getting to the good part, if he would just like if we could somehow compress it, which is why I actually, you know, compress those sort of long fighting sequences and just have only the good parts.

618
00:32:20,941 --> 00:32:31,139
Scott: I think this is actually the kind of thing where if it were made not to a TV series, the TV series would keep rolling around, you know, around in it, but either a miniseries or, you know, movies.

619
00:32:32,548 --> 00:32:33,780
Rym: I know that is good writing.

620
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,480
Rym: The way you said rolling around it, it implies that it is poop.

621
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,282
Scott: Exactly.

622
00:32:37,423 --> 00:32:39,760
Scott: That's why I just like talking about, you know, how he's rolling back.

623
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,895
Rym: You see how Scott did that?

624
00:32:41,017 --> 00:32:41,179
Rym: Yeah.

625
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:54,660
Scott: Then, you know, it would if it was movies that those parts of where the same thing was repeated over and over again would be compressed or even, you know, some of those something I talk about a lot, some of those smaller plots would be removed entirely.

626
00:32:54,801 --> 00:32:56,093
Scott: For example, I talk about like this.

627
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,542
Scott: What's that?

628
00:32:57,663 --> 00:33:01,620
Scott: The girl who's like the sort of feral girl who lives in the sewer?

629
00:33:02,024 --> 00:33:02,751
Scott: Yeah.

630
00:33:02,811 --> 00:33:03,619
Scott: It's like she's pretty cool.

631
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,079
Scott: You know, that kind of plot.

632
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,200
Rym: Oh, she knows a lot about the Shandrian, too, apparently.

633
00:33:07,502 --> 00:33:08,218
Scott: Oh, I didn't know that.

634
00:33:09,702 --> 00:33:10,565
Scott: Got to read book two.

635
00:33:10,846 --> 00:33:16,439
Scott: But but the point is, is that, you know, she is she's obviously useful in the overall story.

636
00:33:16,601 --> 00:33:19,460
Scott: She shows him the secret way into the archives, which is kind of important.

637
00:33:20,061 --> 00:33:30,219
Scott: And, you know, he worries about her when the horrible chemical breaks out in the, you know, chemistry alchemy, Arcanist lab, whatever, which is also kind of an important plot thingy or whatever.

638
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:37,417
Scott: But, you know, but really, it's like, do you need like this extra?

639
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:41,920
Scott: it's like she was barely so barely even in the story before she was used.

640
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,880
Scott: It's like he played music with her once and it was like in a very short scene.

641
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:49,160
Rym: She would be fine if not for the fact that she's clearly part of a harem.

642
00:33:50,182 --> 00:33:52,720
Rym: Look at the way girls are written and portrayed in these books.

643
00:33:53,182 --> 00:33:57,839
Rym: And especially as he starts getting all these girls around him who like him and he likes the one girl.

644
00:33:58,322 --> 00:34:01,920
Rym: And it's all it's one step short of being a tenchi muyo situation.

645
00:34:02,341 --> 00:34:03,480
Scott: Oh, that is true.

646
00:34:03,681 --> 00:34:04,584
Scott: Is that there?

647
00:34:04,705 --> 00:34:06,131
Scott: it seems like there.

648
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:08,762
Rym: once he saved fella, I was like, OK, there's two girls.

649
00:34:08,842 --> 00:34:10,534
Scott: That's well, I mean, come on.

650
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:21,600
Scott: There's the scene where he walks into magic school for like the first time and he pretty much notices because, you know, there's not a lot of girls there, which, you know, this isn't a sexist situation.

651
00:34:21,681 --> 00:34:24,120
Scott: I think it's actually sort of realistic RIT situation.

652
00:34:24,221 --> 00:34:25,900
Scott: And on top of that, it's a fantasy world.

653
00:34:26,061 --> 00:34:27,000
Scott: So it's even worse.

654
00:34:27,502 --> 00:34:27,743
Scott: Right.

655
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:42,199
Scott: So it does make sense that there are not a lot of women in this place, but it does seem that, you know, they're not treated by this society any more, you know, in a sexist way than any other fantasy.

656
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:43,222
Rym: Yeah.

657
00:34:43,402 --> 00:34:48,020
Rym: Then into another fancy world, as in a teenage boy.

658
00:34:48,623 --> 00:34:48,824
Scott: Right.

659
00:34:48,844 --> 00:34:51,199
Scott: The perspective of an adolescent.

660
00:34:52,103 --> 00:34:54,860
Scott: Any time there's a girl, it's like there's a girl.

661
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:55,688
Scott: Holy shit.

662
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:56,539
Scott: There's a girl.

663
00:34:56,641 --> 00:34:57,289
Scott: Holy shit.

664
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,060
Scott: There's a girl there.

665
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,840
Scott: And it's like whenever a girl is there, there's a spotlight.

666
00:35:00,981 --> 00:35:01,709
Scott: She's noticed.

667
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:02,600
Scott: She's named.

668
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:07,400
Rym: He notices her like the galette galette that he borrows money from.

669
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,082
Scott: Exactly.

670
00:35:08,423 --> 00:35:13,099
Scott: Any girl, anything with boobs and a vagina that's around, he notices it.

671
00:35:13,482 --> 00:35:14,339
Scott: He has a name.

672
00:35:14,581 --> 00:35:16,360
Scott: You know, not just that.

673
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,746
Scott: It gets focused on.

674
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:20,820
Rym: the girls are all it's it's the moe harem.

675
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,200
Rym: Every one of them is like an extreme in one direction or the other.

676
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:24,421
Scott: Yeah.

677
00:35:24,481 --> 00:35:35,900
Scott: And it's like there's the one he wants, but there's always this sort of tension with any of them that he could get with them, sort of because, you know, there's girls, you know, around.

678
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:38,531
Scott: And yeah, it's.

679
00:35:38,712 --> 00:35:39,940
Scott: it's a little bit annoying, right?

680
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,040
Scott: It's like, you know, the dude friends.

681
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,180
Scott: It's sort of like I like dude friend characters.

682
00:35:44,702 --> 00:35:49,786
Rym: But and it's like it took me until the second book to be able to even differentiate the two.

683
00:35:49,806 --> 00:35:51,580
Scott: That's that's the thing, right?

684
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,665
Scott: It's like there's the.

685
00:35:52,745 --> 00:35:55,860
Scott: there's the rich dude friend who's like sort of a risk.

686
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,239
Rym: Now, which one's which is William and Sam?

687
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,028
Rym: Which one's which?

688
00:35:58,291 --> 00:35:58,959
Scott: Fuck if I know.

689
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,083
Scott: Yeah, right.

690
00:36:00,163 --> 00:36:10,200
Scott: See, and that's the thing is that it was so weird is how you would have things like you would refer to them like, oh, William and his blah, blah, blah.

691
00:36:10,621 --> 00:36:10,962
Scott: Right.

692
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:15,839
Scott: Like, you know, saying, you know, William was acting in his usual way like this and this and this.

693
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,879
Rym: Meanwhile, it was nothing.

694
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,479
Rym: I know exactly what I what an I known he looks like.

695
00:36:19,801 --> 00:36:20,024
Scott: Right.

696
00:36:20,064 --> 00:36:21,499
Scott: But William and Sam didn't.

697
00:36:21,782 --> 00:36:23,820
Scott: Actually act in different ways.

698
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,279
Scott: They were effectively just the friends.

699
00:36:26,562 --> 00:36:27,573
Scott: He could have had one friend.

700
00:36:27,613 --> 00:36:28,200
Scott: It didn't matter.

701
00:36:28,701 --> 00:36:36,720
Scott: And it's like he would talk about their personalities or the differences between them, but they wouldn't actually sort of behave in different ways.

702
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,322
Scott: And I couldn't.

703
00:36:37,765 --> 00:36:46,416
Scott: you know, it's like you wouldn't notice immediately which one was which, which one did he bump into in the street, who was helping him, who wasn't helping him, who is stealing the girl from him, who wasn't.

704
00:36:47,221 --> 00:36:47,585
Scott: It didn't.

705
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,000
Scott: it was just one of his friends.

706
00:36:49,262 --> 00:36:51,040
Scott: It does not even name those guys.

707
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,079
Scott: They might have just said his good friends were we saw one of his good friends.

708
00:36:55,641 --> 00:36:55,983
Scott: Whatever.

709
00:36:56,103 --> 00:37:02,060
Scott: Now, we do remember Ambrose, but he's basically actually the primary antagonist in the second half of the book.

710
00:37:02,421 --> 00:37:03,446
Scott: He's the primary.

711
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:06,864
Scott: I mean, I think the the Shondrian are the real primary antagonist.

712
00:37:07,045 --> 00:37:09,460
Rym: Yeah, but good luck reading that from the books.

713
00:37:09,781 --> 00:37:10,122
Scott: Yeah.

714
00:37:10,243 --> 00:37:15,359
Scott: But, you know, since they're the dark, evil, mysterious square boss, you can't show you too much of them.

715
00:37:15,501 --> 00:37:17,697
Scott: So early in book one, we got to sell book three.

716
00:37:18,301 --> 00:37:21,200
Scott: Yeah, I mean, even Prince of Nothing does that consult.

717
00:37:21,481 --> 00:37:21,742
Scott: Right.

718
00:37:21,802 --> 00:37:29,059
Scott: Same thing, you know, so they need this Ambrose to be the primary antagonist, but he's only there for the second half of the book.

719
00:37:29,721 --> 00:37:35,223
Scott: And really, the antagonists in the, you know, for the rest of the book are the environment.

720
00:37:35,324 --> 00:37:38,740
Scott: It's really him versus the world and not versus anyone in particular.

721
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:42,560
Rym: Now, here's the other thing I didn't like because there is a lot of stuff I like.

722
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,202
Rym: Don't get me wrong.

723
00:37:43,283 --> 00:37:43,544
Scott: Yeah.

724
00:37:43,986 --> 00:37:51,820
Rym: But the the the thing I didn't like was that the school is set up by the author to cause all of these problems.

725
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,652
Rym: The fact that the tuition cycle is literally.

726
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:56,483
Rym: they interview you, they make up tuition.

727
00:37:56,503 --> 00:37:58,359
Rym: You have to pay it by like noon the next fucking day.

728
00:37:59,801 --> 00:38:00,211
Rym: Really?

729
00:38:00,252 --> 00:38:00,560
Rym: Really?

730
00:38:00,681 --> 00:38:02,059
Rym: That's how the wizard school works.

731
00:38:02,762 --> 00:38:02,923
Scott: Yeah.

732
00:38:02,943 --> 00:38:03,709
Scott: They could have made.

733
00:38:03,769 --> 00:38:05,260
Scott: you know, it is a fictional world.

734
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:09,423
Scott: He could have made the wizard school work any way he wanted to, but he made it work in this way.

735
00:38:09,443 --> 00:38:11,530
Rym: It is kind of ridiculous.

736
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:15,043
Scott: cause this conflict to keep happening over and over again.

737
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:20,520
Scott: And the other thing that really bothered me was like, why couldn't it just be the wizard school recognizes him for a genius?

738
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:21,442
Scott: They let him.

739
00:38:21,543 --> 00:38:25,632
Rym: you know, he's in the wizard school or they don't recognize him and force him to prove it.

740
00:38:25,692 --> 00:38:26,239
Rym: And then he kicks him.

741
00:38:26,621 --> 00:38:28,959
Scott: But yeah, but and he kicks him ass and he gets in.

742
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:34,264
Scott: And then it could all you could have focused more on the jealousy of the other people in the school.

743
00:38:34,304 --> 00:38:39,920
Scott: Instead, it's like the other people in the school are just sort of vaguely jealous or support the other school.

744
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,180
Rym: Other people in the school are different side characters, right?

745
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,064
Scott: Except for Ambrose.

746
00:38:44,245 --> 00:38:45,572
Scott: And the only dude.

747
00:38:45,612 --> 00:38:47,564
Rym: why the fuck does Ambrose even hate him so much?

748
00:38:47,604 --> 00:38:49,440
Rym: That doesn't actually make sense.

749
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,223
Scott: It's he meets.

750
00:38:50,243 --> 00:38:50,988
Scott: Yeah, it's like he's.

751
00:38:51,008 --> 00:38:54,380
Scott: he's like the bad guy he met on the first day of school, just like in any movie.

752
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,270
Rym: High school bully.

753
00:38:55,372 --> 00:38:55,760
Scott: Exactly.

754
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,837
Scott: You meet, you know, whenever you have a movie about high school, there's always shows up and up.

755
00:39:00,442 --> 00:39:01,679
Scott: There's the bully rules.

756
00:39:02,202 --> 00:39:02,991
Scott: It's like Doug.

757
00:39:03,476 --> 00:39:03,800
Scott: Roger.

758
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:04,301
Scott: Yeah.

759
00:39:04,321 --> 00:39:04,423
Scott: Right.

760
00:39:04,443 --> 00:39:05,539
Scott: Why does Roger hate Doug?

761
00:39:06,183 --> 00:39:07,400
Scott: It's just that he was the bully.

762
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,460
Scott: We was with a green face in the first episode.

763
00:39:09,541 --> 00:39:09,944
Scott: That's why.

764
00:39:09,964 --> 00:39:11,840
Scott: And Doug was the new kid in town.

765
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,359
Scott: That's why there's no reason.

766
00:39:13,961 --> 00:39:14,726
Scott: It just how it is.

767
00:39:14,827 --> 00:39:16,540
Rym: Yeah, it's just I got so sick of it.

768
00:39:16,922 --> 00:39:23,100
Rym: And the last thing that bothered me of all these things is that the book is supposed to be in a fantasy world.

769
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:38,520
Rym: And while we're in this university where there's, you know, there's, you know, science and single degree and all these things, there's too many modern sensibilities and too many like modern real world references to like chemistry and things that just feel really out of place.

770
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:45,660
Rym: And it feels like I'm reading a fantasy book of someone who's currently taking like organic chemistry to a one in college.

771
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:53,360
Rym: Maybe one of what like Willemur Sim gets in trouble is like I was mixing water with acid instead of the other way around.

772
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,900
Rym: I just it stood out every time that happened.

773
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:02,600
Rym: Like, really, dude, it'd be like if I wrote a fantasy book and I was like, I went into the you know, I went into the kingdom of blah under the radar.

774
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,201
Scott: Yeah.

775
00:40:03,221 --> 00:40:10,240
Scott: The other thing is, you know, while I like, you know, fantasy worlds and how does this fantasy world work, every fantasy world works differently.

776
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:10,581
Scott: Right.

777
00:40:10,602 --> 00:40:12,000
Rym: This one doesn't give you enough context.

778
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:12,824
Rym: Know how it works.

779
00:40:12,985 --> 00:40:14,739
Scott: Lord of the Rings works like this.

780
00:40:14,941 --> 00:40:15,928
Scott: And prince of nothing.

781
00:40:15,948 --> 00:40:17,500
Scott: It's all about how does it work?

782
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,328
Scott: That's the whole core of the book.

783
00:40:19,388 --> 00:40:21,980
Scott: is how, you know, trying to figure that the fuck out.

784
00:40:22,081 --> 00:40:22,223
Scott: Right.

785
00:40:22,304 --> 00:40:22,993
Scott: Why does the nose?

786
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:23,580
Scott: is this right?

787
00:40:24,101 --> 00:40:25,120
Scott: And it's like Lord of the Rings.

788
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,800
Scott: Well, there's the magic of the elves and, you know, all this stuff.

789
00:40:28,243 --> 00:40:33,060
Scott: But in this game, in this book, there's all these different kinds of magic that are completely unrelated.

790
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:36,218
Rym: Single degree alchemy, sympathy.

791
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:36,500
Scott: Right.

792
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,256
Scott: They got nothing to do with each other.

793
00:40:39,276 --> 00:40:39,880
Scott: Right.

794
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:40,263
Scott: And they don't.

795
00:40:40,284 --> 00:40:42,917
Scott: even he doesn't even try to figure out what the fuck they have to do with each other.

796
00:40:43,281 --> 00:40:50,820
Scott: Saying the name and all of them are like sort of stolen flat out from other fantasy worlds, like saying the names of things.

797
00:40:51,002 --> 00:40:51,799
Scott: That's fucking Earthsea.

798
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,349
Scott: That's straight up Earthsea.

799
00:40:53,652 --> 00:40:57,079
Scott: saying the names of things to get them to obey your will or whatever.

800
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:57,900
Rym: Let's go one step further.

801
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:01,960
Rym: So the way sympathy works with the Alar, you know, it's full metal fucking alchemist.

802
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,859
Rym: No, no, no, it's worse than that.

803
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:09,720
Rym: The Alar bothers me because he makes a big point about and then he split his mind into two pieces.

804
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,932
Rym: And do you remember that prince of nothing when he's with Abenthi and he goes through all the exercises and how to split his mind?

805
00:41:15,952 --> 00:41:16,518
Rym: Mm hmm.

806
00:41:16,981 --> 00:41:17,519
Rym: They're bullshit.

807
00:41:18,361 --> 00:41:22,740
Rym: Like in the real world, they have no analogy to any actual meditative techniques.

808
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,720
Rym: They're so out there and kind of just made up.

809
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,998
Rym: Like if you're going to just make it up to that level, don't even go into that depth with it.

810
00:41:31,663 --> 00:41:33,860
Rym: And then later, like he can do like eight Alar.

811
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:34,892
Rym: Now, fuck you.

812
00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:34,993
Rym: Yeah.

813
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:40,180
Rym: The prince of it does the problem where it makes something seem so monumental.

814
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,180
Rym: And then the next chapter, it's trivial.

815
00:41:44,843 --> 00:41:46,080
Rym: It's like Final Fantasy.

816
00:41:46,601 --> 00:41:51,939
Rym: As soon as like an imp does a million damage to you and then you level up once and now you do a million damage to the imp.

817
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,299
Scott: So that is true.

818
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,020
Scott: It's like you did eight Alar.

819
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:56,684
Scott: Holy shit.

820
00:41:56,724 --> 00:41:58,920
Scott: Well, you know, you're the master now.

821
00:41:59,262 --> 00:42:01,880
Scott: You know, it's like, no, you're just still some kid in magic school.

822
00:42:02,263 --> 00:42:04,300
Scott: You know, it's like, well, how many fuck could the masters do?

823
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,078
Scott: We've never seen them do crazy shit like that.

824
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:09,719
Rym: And or like when he does the in the beginning, right?

825
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:14,680
Rym: It's like it's like he's a kid with no education, came out of nowhere, got into the school in these weird circumstances.

826
00:42:15,302 --> 00:42:17,616
Rym: And on his first day of classes, he uses magic.

827
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:19,959
Rym: And no one's like, how do you learn that?

828
00:42:21,461 --> 00:42:23,179
Rym: No one's like, how come he already knows everything?

829
00:42:24,502 --> 00:42:25,496
Rym: Instead, they get mad at him.

830
00:42:26,462 --> 00:42:28,997
Rym: And the teacher holds a grudge to Hemi.

831
00:42:29,681 --> 00:42:30,820
Scott: Yeah, that that's the thing.

832
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:31,980
Scott: Some of the masters are cool.

833
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,880
Scott: I like the crazy master who I like.

834
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,589
Rym: The crazy master.

835
00:42:35,609 --> 00:42:35,711
Rym: Right.

836
00:42:37,362 --> 00:42:40,139
Scott: Because he's sort of I sort of imagine him as like a timber.

837
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:45,980
Rym: Whenever they're doing the whenever they're doing the like, he's on the horns getting interviewed for something because he's in trouble.

838
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:48,600
Rym: That master is always like, what the fuck does this even matter?

839
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,820
Rym: Why am I even fucking awake?

840
00:42:50,582 --> 00:42:51,405
Scott: I like that guy.

841
00:42:51,425 --> 00:42:54,759
Scott: I actually like the archivist guy a little bit, too.

842
00:42:55,321 --> 00:42:56,853
Rym: He's very.

843
00:42:56,873 --> 00:42:57,599
Rym: he's like Snape.

844
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,144
Scott: Yeah.

845
00:42:59,405 --> 00:43:07,638
Scott: I like the sort of, you know, the the the archivist guy, because he seems like a normal like a good shop teacher, which I think is what he's supposed to be.

846
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:16,000
Scott: But he's just like a completely normal, not crazy, not stupid, stand up, you know, stout guy like, yeah, I can like that guy.

847
00:43:16,361 --> 00:43:23,079
Scott: But all the other ones are kind of like, they don't seem very masterly to me, especially the petty ones.

848
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,740
Scott: How did you get to be a master?

849
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:29,080
Scott: You know, and then one of them is like, you know, seems like the Supreme Court.

850
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,200
Scott: Who's the guy in the Supreme Court?

851
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:30,862
Rym: Chancellor?

852
00:43:31,084 --> 00:43:33,000
Scott: No, on the real Supreme Court of the United States.

853
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,739
Scott: You always just a follower and does what he's told.

854
00:43:35,721 --> 00:43:37,639
Scott: That's the guy who always does what Hemi tells him to do.

855
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,041
Scott: Yep.

856
00:43:38,422 --> 00:43:41,940
Rym: Or then the chancellor, who only actual opinion of anything seems to be.

857
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:43,859
Rym: I'm too old for this shit and I don't care.

858
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:44,362
Scott: Yeah.

859
00:43:44,885 --> 00:43:47,880
Rym: So here's the get before we get to the stuff I liked about these books.

860
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,319
Rym: Emily and I talk about this a lot.

861
00:43:49,880 --> 00:44:00,580
Rym: Works like this that have flaws, but have like these fun iconic moments in them or these good characters kind of scattered out within them are great to be turned into movies because you can't do it.

862
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,540
Rym: You can't do a literal adaptation.

863
00:44:03,444 --> 00:44:03,970
Rym: It would suck.

864
00:44:04,031 --> 00:44:04,820
Rym: It would be too long.

865
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,960
Rym: You have to do a liberal adaptation.

866
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:12,779
Rym: But because the source material is not super great to begin with, no one's going to flip out and get mad at you.

867
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,400
Rym: Like if you change something in Lord of the Rings.

868
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:15,911
Scott: Some crazy nerd.

869
00:44:15,951 --> 00:44:16,600
Rym: No one who matters.

870
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:20,580
Rym: If you change, look at how many people were flipping out about Tom Bombadil.

871
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:23,300
Scott: Well, it's like think about Game of Thrones, right?

872
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:28,400
Scott: There were nerds who were already Game of Thrones fans who might be flipping out about the TV show, but not many.

873
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,618
Scott: Most of them actually like it.

874
00:44:30,022 --> 00:44:33,060
Scott: And two, most people hit the TV show first, right?

875
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:38,960
Scott: So even though Name of the Wind was crazy best selling, even though it's not been adapted to anything, it wasn't actually crazy best selling.

876
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,957
Rym: Almost every book is a best seller, you know?

877
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,140
Rym: But I mean, this is the term that New York Times best seller means bullshit.

878
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:44,903
Scott: I know that.

879
00:44:44,943 --> 00:44:49,000
Scott: But I'm saying regardless of how many copies it actually sold, it's not what I'm referring to.

880
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:55,940
Scott: What I'm referring to is how, you know, on a pond discussing this book on the Internet, many, many people say, oh, I read that.

881
00:44:56,061 --> 00:44:57,400
Scott: Yeah, let me tell you about that one.

882
00:44:57,802 --> 00:45:01,340
Scott: It was already quite popular among the nerd community.

883
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:01,721
Rym: Yes.

884
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:08,780
Rym: So but, you know, even though it is relatively new, that are best to be made into a movie or something, because the wide audience won't have read the book.

885
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,912
Rym: Only the nerds will have.

886
00:45:10,013 --> 00:45:10,660
Scott: And they never will.

887
00:45:11,261 --> 00:45:14,884
Rym: And even if the nerds get mad, they'll be drowned out by all the people who, you know, you could.

888
00:45:14,905 --> 00:45:28,100
Rym: basically you can adapt the story enough to where a creative adapter and a good director can really make the movie stand on its own by casting the right people, focusing on the right things, changing the parts that don't make sense, like Hunger Games.

889
00:45:28,701 --> 00:45:30,519
Rym: They got rid of the stupid goddamn wolves.

890
00:45:31,642 --> 00:45:32,006
Rym: They didn't.

891
00:45:32,067 --> 00:45:33,280
Rym: They just got rid of it.

892
00:45:33,622 --> 00:45:34,349
Scott: I still haven't seen that.

893
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:35,399
Scott: Maybe it'll be on Netflix soon.

894
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,999
Rym: Yeah, the wolves are just wolves.

895
00:45:37,341 --> 00:45:37,971
Scott: Yeah, that's it.

896
00:45:38,032 --> 00:45:38,358
Rym: They don't.

897
00:45:39,101 --> 00:45:42,960
Rym: They don't even in any way reference the bullshit that happened in the book and was stupid.

898
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,614
Scott: The weird genetic engineering nonsense.

899
00:45:44,655 --> 00:45:44,917
Scott: Yeah.

900
00:45:44,957 --> 00:45:45,099
Scott: Yeah.

901
00:45:45,621 --> 00:45:56,699
Rym: So the things I liked about this book when Kvothe is trying to get a load and to teach him names and a load and takes him to the insane place and he's like, I was locked in here, la dee da dee da.

902
00:45:57,101 --> 00:46:00,260
Rym: And he's like and close, like, what do I have to do to be your student?

903
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:01,038
Rym: I'll do anything.

904
00:46:01,761 --> 00:46:08,380
Rym: And it looks like jump off the roof and he immediately jumps off the roof so fast that I can't even be like, just kidding.

905
00:46:09,563 --> 00:46:12,820
Rym: And then you just see like he's the way he describes that scene.

906
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,200
Rym: Like he looks up as he's falling.

907
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:17,356
Rym: You see the master just kind of with his arm out like, oh, fuck.

908
00:46:17,879 --> 00:46:18,100
Scott: Right.

909
00:46:18,301 --> 00:46:20,060
Scott: Because it's like that was so good.

910
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:20,422
Scott: I agree.

911
00:46:20,442 --> 00:46:26,300
Scott: That was a great scene, because what he's doing there is unlike, say, just stealing straight from Earthsea, right?

912
00:46:26,601 --> 00:46:31,860
Scott: He is taking the thing you have already have a set expectation of that from other things you've looked at.

913
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,350
Scott: Say the Matrix, the jump scene.

914
00:46:33,371 --> 00:46:33,451
Scott: Yeah.

915
00:46:34,418 --> 00:46:34,680
Scott: Right.

916
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:39,980
Scott: He's taking your set expectation of a cliche and turning it on its head.

917
00:46:40,363 --> 00:46:40,545
Scott: Right.

918
00:46:40,606 --> 00:46:41,880
Scott: In sort of an obvious way.

919
00:46:42,041 --> 00:46:45,540
Scott: It's not you know, it's not that clever, but it just happens.

920
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:46,600
Scott: You didn't see it coming.

921
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:51,159
Scott: I was thinking Matrix seen all the way right up until the guy's like, you're fucking stupid.

922
00:46:51,602 --> 00:46:52,024
Rym: And I like.

923
00:46:52,045 --> 00:46:54,740
Scott: and then as soon as he said that, I was like, oh, that was awesome.

924
00:46:54,941 --> 00:46:56,929
Rym: I also love the undercurrent of like.

925
00:46:56,950 --> 00:47:00,499
Rym: the people don't know their own reputations, but they grow them anyway.

926
00:47:00,641 --> 00:47:01,871
Rym: And it kind of fits in with the name thing.

927
00:47:01,911 --> 00:47:02,920
Rym: That whole undercurrent is great.

928
00:47:03,441 --> 00:47:07,898
Rym: I love when you get snippets of what other students think about him, because they don't know him.

929
00:47:08,382 --> 00:47:16,920
Rym: They just have these stories of him, you know, both the bloodless because they did, you know, get whipped and he didn't bleed or he got in a fight with a load and a load and threw him off the roof.

930
00:47:17,041 --> 00:47:18,160
Rym: Like that's what they think happened.

931
00:47:18,643 --> 00:47:20,100
Rym: I like those little like flavor bits.

932
00:47:20,602 --> 00:47:29,180
Scott: The thing that I you know, these after the cycling, the only other thing, you know, I mean, we complain it's sort of fan service and you know, stuff like that and sort of shallow.

933
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,520
Scott: But actually, that makes it kind of fun, right?

934
00:47:32,285 --> 00:47:33,320
Scott: Yeah, we're nerds.

935
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:34,559
Scott: We like fantasy books.

936
00:47:34,721 --> 00:47:38,660
Scott: If you put in fantasy, you know, what's what's the word for Mary Sue?

937
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,155
Scott: That's a dude.

938
00:47:40,881 --> 00:47:43,620
Rym: Whatever it is, a couple of terms, I just use Mary Sue for all of them.

939
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:44,042
Rym: Yeah.

940
00:47:44,223 --> 00:47:47,540
Scott: You know, it's kind of fun because he's so awesome.

941
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:48,659
Scott: There's an awesome dude.

942
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:52,320
Scott: It's a good time reading the book, except he's stupid around girls.

943
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,457
Rym: Yeah, it's I just I just tire of it.

944
00:47:55,222 --> 00:47:55,444
Scott: It's like.

945
00:47:55,645 --> 00:47:58,580
Scott: it's like reading, you know, parties and, you know, light and happy reading.

946
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:03,860
Scott: But the thing I actually don't like the most is that it's sort of like just a story.

947
00:48:04,402 --> 00:48:07,360
Scott: There's no real meaning or message or anything.

948
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:14,580
Scott: There's no deep anything, at least, you know, Prince of Nothing has some message about philosophy and knowledge and epistemology.

949
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:18,119
Scott: You know, Lord of the Rings also doesn't mean anything either.

950
00:48:19,382 --> 00:48:21,700
Scott: But there are, you know, there are lots of other fantasy things to do.

951
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:32,420
Scott: Like I was reading the White Goldwielder stuff, and it's like this dude who's a leper, but then he somehow is in this fantasy world and he keeps telling the people in the fantasy world don't know what a leper is.

952
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:45,130
Scott: But it's like, you know, it's all about, you know, leprosy and how, you know, this person, you know, as a disability and living in a world where people don't see him as disabled and he sees himself, you know, and there's.

953
00:48:45,412 --> 00:48:49,880
Scott: there's something going on there in the middle of this fantasy adventure that has a message and a meaning.

954
00:48:50,403 --> 00:48:51,738
Scott: And this doesn't have one.

955
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:57,980
Scott: It's literally just a revenge story of a guy going to try to, you know, on his path of becoming awesome.

956
00:48:58,401 --> 00:49:05,760
Scott: So the leveling up in a JRPG style so he could find the secret Chandri and bad guys and get revenge for killing his parents.

957
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:07,760
Rym: Yeah, but as soon as he levels up, it doesn't matter.

958
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,720
Rym: Like, oh, he's a R'laar, Jesus fucking Christ.

959
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,092
Rym: Oh, but he's not an L.L.

960
00:49:12,153 --> 00:49:12,699
Rym: or whatever.

961
00:49:13,281 --> 00:49:16,360
Scott: And there's mysterious spidery demons somewhere, and it's his fault.

962
00:49:16,462 --> 00:49:17,098
Scott: And that's all we know.

963
00:49:17,581 --> 00:49:20,360
Rym: I also liked the meth lab out in the woods when he slayed the dragon.

964
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:20,969
Scott: That was clever.

965
00:49:21,071 --> 00:49:21,560
Rym: That was great.

966
00:49:22,383 --> 00:49:34,400
Scott: Once once the best part about that whole dragon thing was not only the cleverness of it and of course, the dragons were foreshadowed with that dragon book, how his plan didn't fucking work, how it didn't work, but also how it was a break from wizard school.

967
00:49:34,662 --> 00:49:37,359
Scott: I know they got you away from the wizard school.

968
00:49:37,802 --> 00:49:38,206
Rym: Like so.

969
00:49:38,226 --> 00:49:39,780
Rym: Yeah, here's the fun of all brothers book.

970
00:49:39,921 --> 00:49:41,680
Rym: He slays the goddamn dragon.

971
00:49:42,441 --> 00:49:45,336
Rym: And then the author like goes out of his way to undo.

972
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,399
Rym: Every advantage he got from that.

973
00:49:48,702 --> 00:49:50,920
Scott: You make sure you think it was a Marvel comic book.

974
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,640
Rym: We had to reset the status that by the time he gets back to fucking wizard school.

975
00:49:55,221 --> 00:49:55,785
Rym: He's poor.

976
00:49:56,208 --> 00:49:57,720
Scott: In fact, that's exactly what it's like.

977
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:58,968
Scott: It's like, you know, you.

978
00:49:59,048 --> 00:50:00,840
Scott: it's a. it's like a superhero comic book.

979
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:01,484
Scott: You play.

980
00:50:01,524 --> 00:50:13,460
Scott: it's all about playing with the toys and smashing them up really interestingly and then resetting everything to the status quo when you're, you know, putting everything back away cleanly for the next person, even though it's the same person and it's not a comic book.

981
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,573
Scott: You don't need to fucking do that.

982
00:50:15,018 --> 00:50:15,160
Scott: Right.

983
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,840
Scott: You should just mess up the toys and keep messing them up more.

984
00:50:17,901 --> 00:50:22,319
Scott: And when the toys are all broken, bring buy some new toys and add them into the mix and smash them up, too.

985
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:23,002
Scott: All right.

986
00:50:23,042 --> 00:50:25,779
Scott: That's what you need to do in a novel series.

987
00:50:25,859 --> 00:50:26,020
Scott: Right.

988
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:32,440
Scott: Not fucking keep resetting things all the time, you know, to make what you just smashed up now meaningless.

989
00:50:35,646 --> 00:50:35,789
Rym: Anyway.

990
00:50:36,137 --> 00:50:36,260
Rym: Yeah.

991
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:36,521
Rym: Yeah.

992
00:50:36,541 --> 00:50:38,479
Rym: I mean, it's a you know what?

993
00:50:38,803 --> 00:50:39,979
Rym: It's an OK fantasy book.

994
00:50:40,402 --> 00:50:46,100
Rym: I would only actually recommend it if you're starved for good fantasy because you've read everything else already.

995
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,755
Rym: That's good because it's not bad.

996
00:50:47,816 --> 00:50:48,199
Rym: It's fun.

997
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:52,460
Scott: But if you haven't, there are a lot worse fantasy books you could be reading.

998
00:50:52,761 --> 00:51:01,960
Scott: If you haven't read The Lies of Locke Lamora, read those two books first, because those are also meaningless, but more fun and don't have the same sort of, you know, plots.

999
00:51:02,421 --> 00:51:03,159
Scott: Those are the opposite things.

1000
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:07,520
Rym: Those just escalate and escalate and escalate and escalate and escalate and escalate and escalate.

1001
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:07,984
Rym: I could go on.

1002
00:51:08,004 --> 00:51:11,860
Scott: Well, at the beginning of the second book, it starts out less escalated, but escalates quickly.

1003
00:51:12,183 --> 00:51:12,405
Rym: Yup.

1004
00:51:12,688 --> 00:51:20,960
Rym: To a to a somewhat an end that that author probably can't write himself out of it, which is probably why there isn't a third book yet.

1005
00:51:21,201 --> 00:51:23,960
Scott: I have the second book anyway, I guess The Wise Man's Fear.

1006
00:51:24,301 --> 00:51:24,966
Rym: I have it, too.

1007
00:51:25,067 --> 00:51:25,632
Scott: And I'm going to.

1008
00:51:25,692 --> 00:51:26,680
Scott: I'm going to read it eventually.

1009
00:51:26,921 --> 00:51:34,284
Scott: I think it's like I'm not super excited to read it, you know, but it's like I am curious about what the deal is with the Shondrian and all that stuff.

1010
00:51:34,304 --> 00:51:36,877
Scott: It is it is a a legit mystery.

1011
00:51:36,998 --> 00:51:37,440
Scott: I'm intrigued.

1012
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:38,825
Rym: So I've started.

1013
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:44,820
Rym: I'm reading it, but I'm literally skimming anything about the wizard school where plot is not moving forward.

1014
00:51:45,424 --> 00:51:46,820
Rym: And it's suddenly a lot more enjoyable.

1015
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:49,879
Rym: I think the problem is I read books closely.

1016
00:51:50,443 --> 00:51:50,686
Scott: I do.

1017
00:51:50,747 --> 00:51:51,940
Scott: I always read any book I read.

1018
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,339
Scott: I read fucking every word.

1019
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:56,360
Rym: I mean, The Prince of Nothing, like I read and I work.

1020
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:58,058
Scott: I write that multiple times.

1021
00:51:58,460 --> 00:51:59,418
Rym: I've read that multiple times, too.

1022
00:51:59,902 --> 00:52:00,897
Rym: But this you know what this is?

1023
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:07,160
Rym: Lives of Black Lamora is like a solid B anime.

1024
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:11,039
Rym: Like like a Lupin is like, yeah, exactly.

1025
00:52:11,282 --> 00:52:11,709
Scott: Exactly.

1026
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:12,320
Scott: It is Lupin.

1027
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:19,114
Rym: This is a B minus in that this is on the level of like causing no Yojimbo, like it's pretty good.

1028
00:52:19,134 --> 00:52:19,980
Rym: I like it.

1029
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:26,880
Rym: OK, but when I finish an episode, I don't really care if I see the next episode or not, like I don't really.

1030
00:52:27,281 --> 00:52:34,900
Rym: But then if I read The Prince of Nothing or something, it's like when I watch the episode of Cowboy Bebop and suddenly I remember what it's like to watch something that's like a great.

1031
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:36,740
Scott: Yeah, I don't think I'll give it a B minus.

1032
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:39,340
Scott: I can give it a B because at RIT, we don't have plus minus.

1033
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:46,000
Rym: I have to give it a B minus because I give Black Lamora a B and I give The Prince of Nothing an A.

1034
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:50,080
Scott: I would give Black Lamora a B plus, B plus, B plus or A minus, B plus.

1035
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:55,040
Rym: Right, because I think A minus requires something beyond the story.

1036
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:55,618
Scott: I think it does.

1037
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,840
Scott: So yeah, I'll give Black Lamora a B plus.

1038
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:59,558
Scott: I'll give Name of the Wind just B.

1039
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:03,740
Rym: A minus is a story that isn't written that well.

1040
00:53:04,122 --> 00:53:06,820
Rym: Like it's written less well than something that's written well.

1041
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:08,177
Rym: That's a funny way to put it.

1042
00:53:08,844 --> 00:53:10,440
Rym: But also has the external message.

1043
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:16,219
Rym: A B plus is written better than an A minus, but has less meat beyond the story itself.

1044
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:17,623
Scott: Yep.

1045
00:53:17,892 --> 00:53:18,098
Scott: All right.

1046
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:20,780
Scott: So what is the next book club?

1047
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:25,420
Rym: The next book club book, because there is a movie coming next year, is The Great Gatsby.

1048
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,197
Scott: Isn't it Gatsby?

1049
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:28,919
Scott: You said Gatsby.

1050
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,516
Rym: You know who's written by it?

1051
00:53:33,542 --> 00:53:37,605
Rym: F. F.

1052
00:53:38,272 --> 00:53:39,970
Scott: I guess I said it's Scott Fitzgerald.

1053
00:53:40,276 --> 00:53:40,930
Rym: F. Scott Fitzgerald.

1054
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:41,647
Scott: I did not know that.

1055
00:53:42,071 --> 00:53:42,372
Scott: I know that.

1056
00:53:42,393 --> 00:53:45,130
Scott: I know that that is a name of a famous author person.

1057
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:46,410
Rym: No, The Great Gatsby.

1058
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:48,090
Scott: Wasn't he married to like Ella Fitzgerald?

1059
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:51,630
Scott: Is a famous book that I said there was another Fitzgerald.

1060
00:53:51,951 --> 00:53:52,176
Scott: Right.

1061
00:53:52,217 --> 00:53:52,770
Scott: They were married.

1062
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:54,188
Rym: That I have never read.

1063
00:53:55,791 --> 00:54:00,250
Rym: And I'm going to read it and the movie looks like it's going to be really good.

1064
00:54:00,751 --> 00:54:04,590
Rym: So I want to read the book before I see the movie.

1065
00:54:05,314 --> 00:54:06,469
Scott: I agree with all that.

1066
00:54:06,711 --> 00:54:09,910
Rym: Also, some other people I know read the book recently and said it was great.

1067
00:54:10,651 --> 00:54:11,370
Rym: I assume it's great.

1068
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:11,836
Scott: Why would it not?

1069
00:54:11,876 --> 00:54:12,990
Scott: Why would it be so famous?

1070
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:15,610
Scott: We've heard of it that even, you know, how many years later?

1071
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:17,485
Rym: Scott, have you heard of a book called Ethan Frome?

1072
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:19,330
Rym: Because I've heard of Ethan Frome.

1073
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:22,010
Scott: I did not hear of Ethan Frome until I was made to read it.

1074
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:26,289
Scott: And if I had not been made to read it, I would not have heard of it until people complained about in our forum.

1075
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:27,430
Rym: Ever heard of Atlas Shrugged?

1076
00:54:28,011 --> 00:54:30,506
Scott: I have only because the entire South Park episode.

1077
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:31,616
Rym: You know what?

1078
00:54:31,637 --> 00:54:32,148
Rym: Yeah, I'll say this.

1079
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:34,730
Scott: That's the first time I heard of that book was in that South Park episode.

1080
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:37,310
Rym: Say the same thing I always say about Evangelion.

1081
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:40,850
Rym: A lot of people say Evangelion is overrated or not that great.

1082
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:43,789
Rym: Or, you know, they have all these million things they say about Neo Genesis Evangelion.

1083
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:51,130
Rym: But no matter what, the one thing that is objective is that people are still fucking talking about Evangelion and arguing about it to this day.

1084
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:52,170
Scott: It shows it's important.

1085
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:55,669
Scott: There's if you like it or not, it's important to fucking see it.

1086
00:54:56,550 --> 00:55:00,790
Rym: So The Great Gatsby is one of those books that's in the like whole of famous books.

1087
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:04,290
Rym: Rym probably should have read, but hasn't actually read.

1088
00:55:04,691 --> 00:55:05,153
Scott: You know what?

1089
00:55:06,718 --> 00:55:14,090
Scott: I'm pretty much I'm getting close to seeing a lot of, you know, a great majority of these significant and famous movies in that category.

1090
00:55:14,571 --> 00:55:19,870
Scott: But I am woefully far behind in the book category, especially the real classics.

1091
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:22,030
Rym: Maybe I'll get my next book club book, The Count of Monte Cristo.

1092
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:22,498
Rym: I could read that.

1093
00:55:22,579 --> 00:55:23,170
Rym: Fuck your mother.

1094
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:23,838
Rym: It's really good.

1095
00:55:23,858 --> 00:55:24,529
Rym: You'll blow through it.

1096
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:25,670
Scott: I want to read more.

1097
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:27,190
Rym: Actually, Scott, you will blow through it.

1098
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:29,010
Rym: You will love the every living shit out of that book.

1099
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:31,124
Scott: It's too damn big.

1100
00:55:31,184 --> 00:55:31,930
Scott: I have not read.

1101
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:33,890
Scott: I have not read, you know, War and Peace.

1102
00:55:34,112 --> 00:55:35,710
Scott: I haven't read Crime and Punishment.

1103
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:36,313
Scott: I haven't read.

1104
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:36,514
Scott: really.

1105
00:55:36,876 --> 00:55:39,050
Scott: I haven't read any of these fucking classic books.

1106
00:55:40,032 --> 00:55:40,799
Scott: I haven't even read.

1107
00:55:40,819 --> 00:55:42,190
Rym: I guess it was a high school thing in high school.

1108
00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:47,270
Rym: We'd often use Raskolnikov to be a sort of verb like I totally Raskolnikov.

1109
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:49,987
Scott: I've only read like two Shakespeare's.

1110
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:51,439
Rym: You know, really?

1111
00:55:51,499 --> 00:55:52,267
Rym: Which ones?

1112
00:55:53,571 --> 00:55:53,822
Rym: Uh, Macbeth.

1113
00:55:54,311 --> 00:55:54,981
Scott: Well, no, Hamlet.

1114
00:55:55,022 --> 00:55:55,550
Scott: I've read Hamlet.

1115
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:56,861
Scott: I've read Midsummer Night's Dream.

1116
00:55:56,902 --> 00:55:57,669
Scott: I haven't read Macbeth.

1117
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,449
Rym: Wait, wait, you've never read Macbeth?

1118
00:55:59,870 --> 00:55:59,931
Scott: No.

1119
00:56:00,314 --> 00:56:02,270
Rym: Have I ever seen Macbeth perform?

1120
00:56:02,572 --> 00:56:03,561
Scott: I've read Romeo and Juliet.

1121
00:56:03,581 --> 00:56:04,387
Scott: That's three at least.

1122
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:06,383
Scott: No.

1123
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:08,017
Rym: Wow.

1124
00:56:09,834 --> 00:56:11,350
Rym: I don't know what to say about that, Scott.

1125
00:56:12,493 --> 00:56:12,910
Rym: I just don't.

1126
00:56:14,631 --> 00:56:14,938
Rym: I can't.

1127
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:16,297
Scott: I don't.

1128
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:17,008
Scott: I think that's it.

1129
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:18,589
Rym: Do you know the story of Macbeth?

1130
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:19,663
Scott: There's a dude.

1131
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:24,489
Scott: His aunts are like all witchy and shit.

1132
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:25,086
Rym: What?

1133
00:56:26,477 --> 00:56:26,667
Scott: No.

1134
00:56:28,071 --> 00:56:32,070
Scott: I figure this is like when someone you ask someone what the story of Star Wars is who hasn't seen it, right?

1135
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:35,050
Scott: Do you want me to keep going for hilarity?

1136
00:56:36,301 --> 00:56:36,789
Rym: You can stop.

1137
00:56:37,952 --> 00:56:39,069
Rym: You know, it's kind of unfair.

1138
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:44,410
Rym: You should trap me in a similarly famous thing that I have not read, that you have read.

1139
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:45,649
Scott: Okay.

1140
00:56:47,716 --> 00:56:48,409
Rym: It's hard, isn't it?

1141
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:51,250
Scott: Have you seen Fritz Lang's Metropolis?

1142
00:56:52,452 --> 00:56:53,018
Rym: The new one?

1143
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:54,170
Rym: The one with all the footage?

1144
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:55,070
Scott: Yeah, the one with all the footage?

1145
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:57,730
Rym: No, I've actually only seen snippets of it in classes.

1146
00:56:58,030 --> 00:56:58,589
Scott: What's it about?

1147
00:57:00,214 --> 00:57:01,228
Rym: It's about a city.

1148
00:57:02,312 --> 00:57:05,089
Rym: With a robot computer that can control it.

1149
00:57:05,591 --> 00:57:06,248
Rym: Everything's great.

1150
00:57:06,991 --> 00:57:09,550
Rym: Except everything's not actually great because of the underclass underground.

1151
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:13,790
Rym: And eventually there's a revolution and it's a masterpiece of cinema.

1152
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:14,470
Rym: It's close.

1153
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:17,109
Scott: It's not exactly, but it's close.

1154
00:57:18,731 --> 00:57:20,929
Scott: Uh, have you seen, let's see.

1155
00:57:22,298 --> 00:57:23,069
Rym: Oh, there's this movie.

1156
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:23,989
Rym: It's called Snatch.

1157
00:57:24,573 --> 00:57:26,150
Rym: Have you ever, have you ever seen Snatch?

1158
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:27,028
Scott: Yeah, I've seen Snatch.

1159
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:29,669
Scott: Uh, let's see.

1160
00:57:30,074 --> 00:57:30,424
Scott: What is...

1161
00:57:30,671 --> 00:57:31,110
Rym: Scott Macbeth.

1162
00:57:31,298 --> 00:57:31,570
Rym: Really?

1163
00:57:32,301 --> 00:57:32,430
Scott: What?

1164
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:33,208
Rym: Macbeth.

1165
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:34,869
Scott: What do you want from me?

1166
00:57:35,131 --> 00:57:39,190
Rym: I thought every single person in every high school in America read Macbeth.

1167
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:39,423
Rym: Nope.

1168
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:44,529
Rym: Like I'd literally kind of assumed that everyone who ever went to high school read Macbeth at least once.

1169
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:45,144
Rym: Nope.

1170
00:57:45,591 --> 00:57:46,289
Rym: There was, uh, okay.

1171
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:48,670
Scott: Do you know the story of Born on the Fourth of July?

1172
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:56,840
Rym: That's the guy who is a veteran and legless in a wheelchair, right?

1173
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:59,180
Scott: Uh, you're relatively close.

1174
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:03,340
Scott: He's the guy who completely is unable to communicate sitting basically in a hospital.

1175
00:58:05,087 --> 00:58:06,620
Scott: And he... Oh, oh, yes!

1176
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:09,360
Scott: And then he eventually learns to blink in Morse code at the end.

1177
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:09,999
Rym: Spoilers!

1178
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:15,220
Rym: Because that is referenced in, uh, Metallica and Justice for All.

1179
00:58:16,722 --> 00:58:21,660
Scott: The video one, uh, for the song one by Metallica uses the footage from the movie.

1180
00:58:21,821 --> 00:58:23,037
Rym: Yeah, I've never actually seen the movie.

1181
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:27,960
Scott: I read the book, uh, and saw the movie and, and also the music video.

1182
00:58:28,524 --> 00:58:29,820
Scott: All in the same class in high school.

1183
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:30,480
Scott: Okay.

1184
00:58:31,304 --> 00:58:32,040
Rym: Anyway, I think we're done.

1185
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:32,571
Rym: Yeah.

1186
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:33,700
Rym: Name of the Wind.

1187
00:58:34,062 --> 00:58:34,338
Rym: It's okay.

1188
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:11,620
Scott: And no audience, but unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
