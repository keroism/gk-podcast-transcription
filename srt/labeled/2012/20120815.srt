1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,430
Rym: It's Wednesday August 15th.

2
00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:17,253
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:17,895 --> 00:00:20,986
Rym: I'm posy McPauzer sin, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:21,066 --> 00:00:24,507
Rym: It sounded like you were yawning So I was kind of backing off to give you time to finish yawning.

5
00:00:24,527 --> 00:00:24,990
Rym: tonight.

6
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:29,190
Rym: We're talking about the ranks of the black order and yawning.

7
00:00:29,971 --> 00:00:30,966
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:31,854 --> 00:00:33,948
Rym: So how many of you are yawning right the fuck now?

9
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:35,291
Rym: Kids.

10
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:36,840
Rym: if you weren't now you are.

11
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:39,316
Rym: but uh yeah It's kind of high.

12
00:00:39,356 --> 00:00:50,748
Rym: we want to do the shows quickly now for the next year or two because as of a couple days ago counter-strike go is in open beta and I pretty much play it every day when I get home from work.

13
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,499
Scott: I'm planning once I get home from the show.

14
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,270
Rym: I was playing it when Scott arrived.

15
00:00:54,531 --> 00:01:00,999
Rym: Normally Scott beats me in my own house for GeekNights, but today He comes home, and I've already been playing counter-strike for a while.

16
00:01:01,642 --> 00:01:02,404
Scott: Why wouldn't you be?

17
00:01:03,046 --> 00:01:04,170
Rym: it's you know?

18
00:01:05,294 --> 00:01:06,098
Rym: Too many games.

19
00:01:06,178 --> 00:01:10,936
Rym: I've waited for forever, and they finally come out And they're not what I wanted.

20
00:01:11,217 --> 00:01:13,405
Rym: counter-strike go is exactly what I wanted.

21
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:19,282
Scott: it's counter-strike Polished to be more modern and shit, and it's still counter-strike.

22
00:01:20,264 --> 00:01:21,046
Rym: Oh my god.

23
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:24,596
Scott: That's all there is to it But it's Wednesday not Tuesday.

24
00:01:24,616 --> 00:01:32,290
Rym: You don't care about that stuff because clearly you only listen to anime and read comics Possibly manga about listening to anime blind?

25
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:35,550
Rym: uh Well it depends anyway.

26
00:01:36,633 --> 00:01:41,304
Rym: So well I guess listening to the anime episodes Sure, you know they just listeners here.

27
00:01:41,364 --> 00:01:47,202
Rym: well listener yes But there is actually some big convention news that many of you might not have noticed.

28
00:01:47,242 --> 00:01:52,040
Scott: so every year not actually convention news Specifically, but it does.

29
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,590
Rym: I was gonna make that point.

30
00:01:53,912 --> 00:02:07,170
Rym: But if you ask the average person who knows about comics And this is I think why the thing we're about to talk about happened what mocha is Their response will invariably be that convention with the indie comics not that museum.

31
00:02:08,531 --> 00:02:09,675
Rym: And that's the problem.

32
00:02:09,856 --> 00:02:13,350
Rym: the mocha is the Museum of comic and cartoon arts in New York City.

33
00:02:14,193 --> 00:02:22,168
Rym: I've never actually been to anything that they've ever done or to their actual building other than When I go to the mocha festival every year.

34
00:02:22,188 --> 00:02:25,746
Scott: well I mean I was a member of the museum for like a couple years.

35
00:02:25,826 --> 00:02:26,670
Rym: I was a member twice.

36
00:02:26,811 --> 00:02:28,237
Rym: I never once used any perk.

37
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:34,028
Rym: I mean in fact when I went to the mocha festival I had already lost my card, so I paid full price for the badge.

38
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:36,430
Scott: anyway I you could just tell them your name and stuff.

39
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:43,070
Scott: I was aware that they were a museum and had a museum location, and I was aware of events held at that location.

40
00:02:43,732 --> 00:02:48,870
Scott: But the thing is that location the museum was in because they had so little monies was very hidden.

41
00:02:49,071 --> 00:02:51,885
Scott: It wasn't even any way to tell where it was from the street you had.

42
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:52,930
Scott: there was no sign.

43
00:02:53,271 --> 00:02:54,174
Scott: There was no nothing.

44
00:02:54,434 --> 00:02:56,942
Scott: you had to know where it was to get in there.

45
00:02:57,102 --> 00:02:57,644
Scott: It was not.

46
00:02:57,704 --> 00:02:59,630
Scott: it was upstairs in a place.

47
00:03:01,371 --> 00:03:03,760
Scott: So it's like hardly anyone went there usually the.

48
00:03:03,961 --> 00:03:13,137
Scott: you know if a museum had like some street presence You'd get foot traffic, and you can get monies But you know not being so hard to find.

49
00:03:13,218 --> 00:03:18,725
Scott: I guarantee that they even probably lost money of people trying to find it and not Finding it and giving up.

50
00:03:19,712 --> 00:03:33,210
Rym: Now meanwhile the mocha festival, which is what most people know mocha as is Actually one of my favorite Conventions slash festival slash events every year it's right up there with packs magfest everything we do.

51
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:38,508
Scott: But it was also the primary fundraiser for the mocha pretty much the only fundraiser for the museum right.

52
00:03:38,528 --> 00:03:40,033
Scott: so what they would do is They hold this festival.

53
00:03:40,274 --> 00:03:48,889
Scott: the festival would pay for itself and pay for a year of expenses for the museum And because the museum was paying crazy rent on this place that nobody could see.

54
00:03:50,034 --> 00:03:56,119
Scott: They had to keep raising the price not of entrance to the mocha festival But for tables at the festival.

55
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:07,086
Scott: granted they could probably double the price and still fill maybe But they kept jacking up that price year after year and people did complain because they're poor like SVA college students or whatever and whatnot.

56
00:04:08,512 --> 00:04:11,370
Scott: So the museum had money troubles yep.

57
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:31,450
Rym: But I think the primary trouble is simply that due to you know the factors you talked about and just in general Nerds know about conventions and people will travel for events like this, but Museums that aren't big sort of like municipal like very well-known museums Generally don't get a lot of traffic.

58
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:36,009
Scott: I mean if you know some of them do you know like look at museum of sex for example right?

59
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:36,130
Rym: Yeah?

60
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,035
Rym: Well, that's sex.

61
00:04:37,437 --> 00:04:39,990
Scott: I'm just saying, but you know it had street.

62
00:04:40,171 --> 00:04:51,556
Scott: Maybe if it was the and had money for marketing of comic and cartoon sexual arts It would have had a lot more it this the museum of sex had marketing and it all said street presence Which gets people in the door?

63
00:04:51,576 --> 00:04:51,676
Scott: Yeah?

64
00:04:51,716 --> 00:04:54,144
Rym: I remember seeing ads that were like Museum of Sex.

65
00:04:54,465 --> 00:04:57,535
Scott: right you know the mocha Pretty great.

66
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,764
Scott: Yeah, it didn't have the money or the location to do that.

67
00:05:00,804 --> 00:05:05,359
Scott: so the only people who go to it pretty much are People going to it for like an event.

68
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,343
Scott: who know about it.

69
00:05:06,363 --> 00:05:07,528
Scott: We're already in the know.

70
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:08,030
Scott: insiders.

71
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:15,603
Scott: you don't get you know this any spread whatsoever or People might like you know know about it like super comics.

72
00:05:15,643 --> 00:05:16,607
Scott: fans know about it.

73
00:05:16,687 --> 00:05:20,188
Scott: visit, New York And let's spend you know an hour or two going to it.

74
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:25,130
Scott: But that and you know people in the industry obviously now they had events and all these other things.

75
00:05:25,251 --> 00:05:27,931
Rym: But they just were never really on my radar compared to other stuff I did.

76
00:05:27,991 --> 00:05:34,310
Rym: but the long and short of it is that the museum of comic and cartoon arts ran out of money.

77
00:05:34,732 --> 00:05:35,917
Rym: Yeah, so what?

78
00:05:35,937 --> 00:05:38,870
Scott: they even had to sell a few arts to pay some bills.

79
00:05:39,051 --> 00:05:47,370
Rym: So they have effectively and I'm not going to go through all the gritty details of what happened But they have transferred all of their assets to the society of illustrators.

80
00:05:47,852 --> 00:05:57,688
Scott: Yeah, so on the one hand some people are upset because they're like oh now You're sort of you know in a way saying that comics is a subset of illustrator of the greater art of illness.

81
00:05:57,749 --> 00:06:00,773
Scott: wait wait illustration it is Not really.

82
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:02,297
Scott: it's also writing.

83
00:06:02,337 --> 00:06:03,621
Scott: illustration doesn't involve writing.

84
00:06:03,862 --> 00:06:06,790
Rym: yeah, but it but part of the an aspect of comics is a subset.

85
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,564
Rym: I mean anime is a subset of animation, but yet.

86
00:06:09,584 --> 00:06:10,770
Rym: There's writers and producers.

87
00:06:11,392 --> 00:06:13,842
Scott: People have a comics is not a subset of illustration.

88
00:06:13,862 --> 00:06:16,070
Scott: I mean there is illustration involved.

89
00:06:16,112 --> 00:06:19,359
Scott: well No, it is the making of comics, but it is not a.

90
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:25,050
Rym: you know that portion of its set is a subset of illustration But another portion of it is a subset of other things.

91
00:06:26,351 --> 00:06:28,450
Scott: It's like saying anime is a subset of music.

92
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:32,550
Rym: It's like no it's not what anime is a subset of for example art and aspects of anime.

93
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:35,097
Scott: Every art is a subset of art.

94
00:06:35,278 --> 00:06:47,951
Scott: so the problem is the inheritance structure of the sets is actually Multi-tiered and complex anyway, but you know the symbolically you know people don't like that, but otherwise this really isn't so bad Right.

95
00:06:47,971 --> 00:06:50,568
Scott: the society of illustrators actually has real space.

96
00:06:51,273 --> 00:06:52,883
Rym: I would say this lots of money.

97
00:06:53,044 --> 00:07:06,569
Rym: if you were choosing Relatively having mocha be owned and be considered a subset of the Society of illustrators or the Society of writers It's pretty much 50/50 Right, but it's like you wouldn't want to have it.

98
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:10,200
Scott: It's better than like someone privately buying it or who knows what.

99
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:24,289
Rym: I think it's a silly concern because the side of illustrators is an ancient Nonprofit dedicated soul is basically a lot like the mocha, but it's more of a like outreach group Yep, and they actually have a really good space that the mocha is going to move into.

100
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:27,463
Scott: Well, I mean the mocha isn't moving into it right.

101
00:07:27,683 --> 00:07:29,190
Scott: basically there is no mocha.

102
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:33,025
Scott: It's just the society of illustrators owns all the things that belong to mocha.

103
00:07:33,126 --> 00:07:35,655
Rym: well no from what I'm reading Yes, which includes the name.

104
00:07:35,715 --> 00:07:38,726
Rym: so the mocha as a thing is just.

105
00:07:38,786 --> 00:07:39,528
Scott: it's just a trademark.

106
00:07:40,152 --> 00:07:41,508
Scott: That is now the property of the Sun.

107
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:51,230
Rym: yes And all the collected works and as far as I can tell all the people who work for it The all two people yeah, yeah, and as a result the mocha festival is also going to be a part of it.

108
00:07:51,511 --> 00:07:59,128
Scott: Yeah, so you know they didn't give a lot of details and what's gonna happen with the festival But basically it looks good, and it also looks not too good right?

109
00:07:59,168 --> 00:08:02,760
Scott: the good Is that society illustrators has money from other things?

110
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,690
Scott: It's not like the mocha which is getting all its money from this festival.

111
00:08:06,716 --> 00:08:17,230
Scott: so You know they could just run the mocha festival as a regular fundraiser Since it won't be their only fundraiser for the society of illustrators.

112
00:08:17,552 --> 00:08:22,801
Scott: They don't need to jack up the prices on the tables and stuff And they could just run it and make a regular amount of money off it.

113
00:08:22,821 --> 00:08:23,685
Scott: There'll be no problem.

114
00:08:24,207 --> 00:08:27,257
Scott: on the other hand You know the mocha festival.

115
00:08:27,277 --> 00:08:29,343
Scott: It was not inexpensive to run.

116
00:08:29,363 --> 00:08:30,205
Scott: It is not.

117
00:08:30,326 --> 00:08:32,457
Scott: It's not like this cheap thing like oh It's easy to do.

118
00:08:32,477 --> 00:08:36,438
Scott: so We'll see what exactly they decide to do with it.

119
00:08:36,518 --> 00:08:39,466
Scott: I highly doubt that they will kill it though.

120
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:41,150
Scott: They may change things.

121
00:08:42,071 --> 00:08:56,610
Rym: Well, we'll see what they would change because if they if it is not primarily a comic like indie sort of underground or you know basically non superhero Standard DC Marvel comic fest I probably wouldn't bother going because but I you know.

122
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:05,748
Scott: But if you think about it right the mocha festival on its own right was fun was paying for a museum for a whole year and also for itself.

123
00:09:05,768 --> 00:09:11,378
Scott: if They kill it or something happens to it And it dies out a new one will start immediately.

124
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:20,630
Scott: anyone can just start the festival as its own Organization who has the contacts with all of those people you know and just start a new mocha festival.

125
00:09:20,771 --> 00:09:24,977
Scott: Call it something else, but say hey guys This is the mocha festival.

126
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:27,408
Scott: It's bait, but it's only got to pay for itself.

127
00:09:27,468 --> 00:09:27,850
Scott: That's it.

128
00:09:28,071 --> 00:09:30,223
Scott: It doesn't have to pay for anything else, so we're these are good.

129
00:09:30,243 --> 00:09:31,108
Scott: the prices are gonna be.

130
00:09:31,128 --> 00:09:31,349
Scott: let's see.

131
00:09:31,389 --> 00:09:39,741
Rym: now It seems like things are gonna be fine because the the society of illustrators said straight up that their goal Is to continue to stage the mocha fest in its current location nice.

132
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:43,414
Rym: dedicate a gallery in a building to mocha's Perfection.

133
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:46,570
Scott: making that your goal doesn't mean you're going to do it.

134
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:51,470
Scott: Just see how my goal is to be to do had did make the Concord fly Scott.

135
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,715
Scott: It's not gonna happen.

136
00:09:52,735 --> 00:09:56,550
Rym: all corporate things are goals because you can't actually promise anything.

137
00:09:57,051 --> 00:09:59,098
Rym: I can promise something and you might not do it.

138
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:01,425
Scott: I can promise GeekNights' episodes.

139
00:10:01,806 --> 00:10:02,789
Scott: There will be more of them.

140
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:05,378
Scott: Warranty at least one.

141
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:06,843
Rym: you want a warranty.

142
00:10:06,883 --> 00:10:07,966
Rym: I'll slap a warranty.

143
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,254
Rym: you can ship your head Bulls ass.

144
00:10:10,515 --> 00:10:15,170
Scott: I promise I will not die before the next week night's episode this episode being the next ones.

145
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:17,749
Rym: Tell me how the view is from that bull's-ass.

146
00:10:18,711 --> 00:10:23,610
Rym: Anyway, and a bunch of other things and mocha memberships will be honored by the Society of illustrators.

147
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,493
Rym: Whatever that does that mean?

148
00:10:24,513 --> 00:10:25,878
Scott: I'm a Society of illustrators member.

149
00:10:25,898 --> 00:10:29,250
Scott: I guess okay does that bet me Bennett more benefits?

150
00:10:29,391 --> 00:10:30,095
Rym: I have no idea.

151
00:10:30,115 --> 00:10:32,469
Rym: I don't do much with the Society of illustrators either, okay?

152
00:10:33,731 --> 00:10:42,938
Rym: But it'll be interesting to see what happens to the festival because I realized that if I look at every Convention I have ever attended in my entire life.

153
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:52,563
Rym: I've spent more money in any one mocha fest on Goods from the convention, then I have spent it probably every other convention.

154
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:53,787
Rym: I've ever attended combined.

155
00:10:53,807 --> 00:11:00,250
Rym: Yeah, yeah And that's not just a factor of me having more money now because I still go back three badges.

156
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:04,795
Rym: So We'll see what happens with this.

157
00:11:05,358 --> 00:11:22,023
Rym: I don't think it's gonna be a big drama fest because the The amount of internet like freak out about it has been very low and the few like I guess complaints are like the things got raised seem to be raised in a Relatively erudite and sort of.

158
00:11:22,545 --> 00:11:23,490
Rym: let's discuss this.

159
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,596
Rym: What do you think will happen?

160
00:11:24,636 --> 00:11:27,070
Rym: fashion as opposed to the fanboy?

161
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:39,888
Rym: Outrage that happened when you're a comic-con said they were killing the New York Anime Festival Where the response was they're trying to sabotage Anime or they're trying to like drive us furries out of the convention?

162
00:11:39,948 --> 00:11:42,110
Scott: real answer You don't make them any fucking money.

163
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:46,129
Scott: So why do they want to pay money to rent a space in the Javits to put you in?

164
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:50,188
Scott: Separately when that doesn't make that doesn't give them any benefit financially whatsoever.

165
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:53,443
Rym: Yep I love how the New York Anime Festival like announcement.

166
00:11:53,483 --> 00:11:59,865
Rym: when that happened they basically Did everything possible to not say that they were killing it because it doesn't make money.

167
00:11:59,925 --> 00:12:01,470
Rym: they're like good news everybody.

168
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:05,850
Rym: We're merging the New York Anime Festival into the comic-con.

169
00:12:06,372 --> 00:12:08,137
Scott: We're not gonna use that name anymore.

170
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:12,470
Rym: It's gonna be an integral part of the New York Comic-Con.

171
00:12:12,952 --> 00:12:26,538
Rym: Yeah, which is code for yeah, there's no more New York Anime Festival but anyway things Of the day.

172
00:12:26,558 --> 00:12:27,262
Rym: What do you got for me?

173
00:12:28,146 --> 00:12:31,618
Scott: Oh, so You know Alfred Hitchcock, he's pretty awesome.

174
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,044
Rym: He's pretty great.

175
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,430
Rym: I've seen a lot of his movies.

176
00:12:34,551 --> 00:12:36,360
Scott: Yeah, I was actually who are we talking to recently?

177
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,150
Scott: like hadn't seen Rear Window or something?

178
00:12:38,973 --> 00:12:40,080
Scott: Yeah, and I was ready.

179
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,488
Scott: I was gonna like stab myself in the head.

180
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:53,330
Scott: Whoa anyway, so yeah, if you haven't seen those See them or stab yourself, you know, there's probably a torrent of everything Hitchcock ever did.

181
00:12:53,391 --> 00:13:01,669
Rym: But even if you want to go legit We bought many years ago this DVD box set that was like 20 Alfred Hitchcock movies for like five bucks.

182
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:08,930
Scott: Yep anyway So if you don't know in most of his movies Alfred Hitchcock himself, you know.

183
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:12,120
Scott: And the TV show would you know make a cameo like he would.

184
00:13:12,461 --> 00:13:15,570
Scott: he wouldn't make a cameo like, you know have lines speaking lines.

185
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,459
Scott: He would be easily be an extra in his own.

186
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:28,330
Scott: try to get on a bus answer a phone Walking around in the background standing in a crowd, you know hiding in a window Doing all kinds of stuff, you know, we're big office full of people.

187
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,870
Scott: He's one of the guys in the office stuff like that, you know.

188
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:36,570
Scott: He just be in the movie on screen somewhere, which is why you know, he is a recognizable person.

189
00:13:36,771 --> 00:13:40,408
Scott: You know now for anyone else because he introed his TV show.

190
00:13:40,448 --> 00:13:44,124
Rym: Yes that Think about how many kids today watch a show.

191
00:13:44,144 --> 00:13:45,250
Scott: the line drawing.

192
00:13:45,411 --> 00:13:46,153
Rym: I'm saying how many kids.

193
00:13:46,173 --> 00:13:50,970
Rym: they will watch a show like Family Guy or the Simpsons and something will parody that Hitchcock presents opening.

194
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:57,430
Rym: They'll think that that's a joke for the Simpsons as opposed to a reference to something older or even know.

195
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:03,939
Scott: All right, but it's like, you know, a lot of people who work not, you know Behind the scenes on things even like famous directors.

196
00:14:04,421 --> 00:14:05,845
Scott: people might know their names.

197
00:14:05,885 --> 00:14:10,399
Scott: their names might be incredibly famous But you still won't know what they look like, right?

198
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,930
Scott: But Hitchcock people know he looks like any at least old people.

199
00:14:14,393 --> 00:14:16,451
Scott: Yeah, anyway, well people who know who he is Nobody.

200
00:14:16,471 --> 00:14:16,592
Scott: look.

201
00:14:16,612 --> 00:14:24,370
Rym: now your thing of the day is partly more notable than it would be if it were anyone else Because of the sheer number of works that Hitchcock has done.

202
00:14:24,591 --> 00:14:36,135
Scott: I know you start watching this thing and it's like, you know the very first movies that you see in this thing are from like the 20s and they go all the way up to 60s 70s, right?

203
00:14:36,256 --> 00:14:36,939
Scott: It's kind of crazy.

204
00:14:36,979 --> 00:14:43,270
Scott: Anyway, but yeah, this is every Hitchcock cameo in a movie that his own movie.

205
00:14:44,431 --> 00:14:45,154
Scott: It's pretty epic.

206
00:14:45,395 --> 00:14:50,428
Scott: It's only four minutes long because you know, the cami the cameos are very short But you should.

207
00:14:52,076 --> 00:14:54,565
Scott: You should watch this and all the movies.

208
00:14:54,585 --> 00:15:01,890
Rym: when I was very very young I would pretty much like Alfred Hitchcock presents was like a staple of my extremely young childhood.

209
00:15:02,171 --> 00:15:08,330
Rym: Yeah, so speaking of movies, you know, there's all these sort of mashups or super cuts of movies.

210
00:15:08,612 --> 00:15:11,288
Rym: You know Tom Hanks peeing in movies or whatever his favorite.

211
00:15:11,913 --> 00:15:13,249
Rym: Yeah, specifically that one.

212
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:20,957
Rym: But this one in particular gets a lot of points my thing of the day because of the sheer breadth of movies from which it drew its sources.

213
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:27,558
Rym: and it works particularly well because the way the lyrics are Presented in baby got back.

214
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,290
Rym: It's more spoken word than singing.

215
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:33,944
Rym: So it actually sounds a lot like the original song in many places.

216
00:15:34,526 --> 00:15:35,490
Rym: This is just very well done.

217
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,589
Rym: It is baby got back sung by a couple hundred movies.

218
00:15:39,011 --> 00:15:43,247
Scott: I like how they even sometimes creatively connect the clips like that.

219
00:15:43,327 --> 00:15:44,030
Scott: I saw one part.

220
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,658
Scott: I forget what the lyric was, but it showed John Travolta.

221
00:15:46,678 --> 00:15:49,246
Scott: I think Pulp Fiction and it cut to John Travolta.

222
00:15:49,627 --> 00:15:50,390
Scott: Saturday Night Fever.

223
00:15:50,731 --> 00:15:53,963
Scott: Yeah, right say, you know to combine to say one line.

224
00:15:53,983 --> 00:15:55,650
Rym: It's like a lot of love went into this thing.

225
00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:01,529
Scott: Yeah, that takes hard work to specifically not just find people saying all the words but to go for the.

226
00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:07,070
Scott: you know That element as well Pushes this one above the rest of the pack.

227
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:22,009
Rym: So in the meta moment, we are going to be at the penny arcade expo prime and the penny arcade expo dev doing three three events short subjects in gaming Academia versus reality and the GeekNights' tabletop workshop.

228
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:25,423
Scott: now I learned something to probably finish working on the.

229
00:16:25,604 --> 00:16:32,209
Rym: actually I've been working hard on Two-thirds of one of them and on the fullness of another one of them.

230
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:49,250
Rym: But anyway, the thing you need to know is that if you want to go to the GeekNights' tabletop workshop All of the tabletop content is in the red lion Which is a hotel nearby because packs long ago outgrew pretty much every venue in tiny Seattle.

231
00:16:49,411 --> 00:16:51,921
Scott: Didn't the schedule say like room 302 or something?

232
00:16:51,961 --> 00:16:54,250
Scott: Yeah, that sounds like the room that it was in last year.

233
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:57,070
Rym: Yeah, but supposedly the red lion has a lot of this content.

234
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:57,672
Rym: So we're gonna see.

235
00:16:57,693 --> 00:16:59,138
Scott: we're gonna see exactly where it is.

236
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,189
Rym: So but more important ask tabletop people Enforcers now there it is.

237
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,515
Rym: Here's the more important part on.

238
00:17:05,836 --> 00:17:17,170
Rym: you have to sign up for this ahead of time Because the number of seats is limited and if PAX East was any indication this thing is gonna be completely full.

239
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:24,171
Scott: I have a feeling though people won't actually sign up and that it'll just be first come first serve at the door for the empty People.

240
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,877
Rym: I'm pretty sure people will sign up.

241
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:31,750
Rym: based on what I've learned from how the signups are gonna work Tabletop stuff does not have a lot of seats.

242
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:35,422
Rym: This has like 40 less seats than the room.

243
00:17:35,463 --> 00:17:38,757
Rym: We did this in at PAX East and at PAX East We turned a lot of people away.

244
00:17:38,797 --> 00:17:41,050
Scott: Yeah, but at PAX Prime last year, it was like Nova.

245
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,200
Rym: Yeah, because PAX Prime it wasn't even in the goddamn book.

246
00:17:43,361 --> 00:17:44,124
Rym: It was an experiment.

247
00:17:44,285 --> 00:17:45,270
Scott: Is this gonna be in the book?

248
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:47,641
Rym: Yeah, this is legit like in PAX East.

249
00:17:47,681 --> 00:17:48,365
Rym: He was in the book.

250
00:17:48,405 --> 00:17:49,289
Rym: So it filled up axes.

251
00:17:49,491 --> 00:17:50,768
Scott: I didn't think it was in the book at all.

252
00:17:51,151 --> 00:17:53,199
Rym: It was in the schedule and in the in the.

253
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:53,902
Rym: whatever.

254
00:17:53,922 --> 00:17:54,383
Rym: I don't know if they.

255
00:17:54,464 --> 00:17:58,390
Rym: I think the description was I don't remember Wasn't but the location was whatever.

256
00:17:59,391 --> 00:18:01,370
Scott: Anyway, anyway, I want to add something.

257
00:18:01,892 --> 00:18:08,989
Scott: We always talk about all the different places on the internet that you can find us and join us and follow us and read us And get our info and all that business, right?

258
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:16,297
Scott: There's one place that we really haven't mentioned in years and with the release of CSGO I want to mention it.

259
00:18:16,699 --> 00:18:18,790
Scott: There is a official GeekNights steam group.

260
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:25,437
Scott: It's wicked old but it's still there and if you want to play games on Steam with other listeners It's just a public group.

261
00:18:25,478 --> 00:18:26,303
Scott: You can just fucking join.

262
00:18:26,384 --> 00:18:28,658
Rym: Yeah guys do any times I've played tf2 with.

263
00:18:28,678 --> 00:18:30,670
Rym: yes, like people are we trying to view in the forum?

264
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,550
Scott: Yeah, people always trying to friend me on Steam.

265
00:18:32,631 --> 00:18:37,230
Scott: It's like if I don't know you I'm not Friending you and actually I should go through because I used to just friend everyone on Steam.

266
00:18:37,311 --> 00:18:45,710
Scott: I should go through and delete all the people aren't actually friends from friends But it's like if you're just some listener join the GeekNights steam group and we can play games together.

267
00:18:45,831 --> 00:18:50,916
Scott: Anyway, you don't need to actually be friends You know, so You should join that shit.

268
00:18:51,016 --> 00:18:52,382
Scott: We're just intellectual ha.

269
00:18:52,442 --> 00:18:54,470
Scott: and if you're not on Steam seriously, what?

270
00:18:55,752 --> 00:18:58,383
Scott: Even if you have a Mac you can at least get steam and portal.

271
00:18:58,424 --> 00:19:01,750
Rym: I guess in this day and age Steam is obligatory, right?

272
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:04,159
Scott: if you don't have steam installed your computer then why listen?

273
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:08,721
Rym: this book club book is the man who was Thursday and We have a ton of videos.

274
00:19:08,761 --> 00:19:14,986
Rym: I updated I finally uploaded just About six months after PAX East highlights reel from PAX East 2012.

275
00:19:14,986 --> 00:19:23,035
Scott: Yeah I just sent out the newsletter again today and I had to link to like five or six new YouTube videos We've made since the last newsletter.

276
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:24,881
Rym: Yeah, I got a new pony mashup.

277
00:19:25,242 --> 00:19:27,369
Rym: I got a bunch of a bunch of stuff.

278
00:19:27,991 --> 00:19:33,430
Rym: So in fact, we got a new one of our lectures up from PAX East 2012 a lot more videos going out.

279
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:35,110
Rym: Yeah, I think that's it.

280
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:42,208
Rym: We should get into the main bit which is another Timo comic because as you know our dear friend Timo particle physicist many many

281
00:19:42,268 --> 00:19:48,049
Scott: years ago He sent us a box of comics from Finland and Europe and we were gonna read

282
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:51,030
Rym: him and Give him back and send him a care package in return.

283
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:55,587
Scott: So but we took many years to do this because we're bums and sir.

284
00:19:55,607 --> 00:19:57,314
Scott: I haven't even read comics I've paid for.

285
00:19:57,334 --> 00:19:58,700
Scott: how am I gonna read comic?

286
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,564
Scott: someone else gave me.

287
00:19:59,644 --> 00:20:03,827
Rym: the thing is some of the comics He gave us are hard to get and pretty damn good.

288
00:20:03,847 --> 00:20:03,907
Scott: Yep

289
00:20:04,711 --> 00:20:16,707
Rym: So what we're reviewing tonight is a comic called the ranks of the Black Order though You may find it under a Ridiculous number of other names ranging from the Black Order Brigade not

290
00:20:16,747 --> 00:20:18,373
Scott: too bad a name But still wrong

291
00:20:18,454 --> 00:20:21,326
Rym: to the Falange de la de noir

292
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:22,210
Scott: the correct name.

293
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:26,701
Rym: Oh, what was it was like chaos something chaos theory or something?

294
00:20:26,741 --> 00:20:29,688
Rym: Yeah, I found some weird titles for this comic.

295
00:20:29,888 --> 00:20:44,644
Rym: Yeah but if you don't listen to the rest of this, we're not gonna spoil anything, but the ranks of the Black Order is a Fantastic Comic, it's just one book and an entire story is told within it start to finish.

296
00:20:45,506 --> 00:20:46,167
Rym: It's brutal.

297
00:20:46,187 --> 00:20:54,485
Rym: It's sad depressing Almost inspirational, but it's inspirational in that kind of oppositely inspirational way.

298
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,950
Scott: Well, you really liked it, huh?

299
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,236
Scott: I actually did really like.

300
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:58,322
Scott: I just thought it was kind of okay.

301
00:20:58,543 --> 00:21:03,829
Rym: I think the reason I really liked it is that it reminded me of Jason and Hemingway.

302
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:09,410
Scott: Jason as in Jason chainsaw axe-murdering coming out of the lake Jason.

303
00:21:10,094 --> 00:21:21,585
Rym: yeah, of course the scene where the guy comes out of the lake and hockey mask Jason Jason who is known by no other name who makes Comics that Jason comics filled with melancholy that make you go.

304
00:21:21,605 --> 00:21:29,389
Rym: Ah Yeah, I mean, yeah that definitely I think you reacted to any Jason comic ever reading the last panel but for going.

305
00:21:30,453 --> 00:21:37,178
Scott: But that J that aspect of the Jason I think is actually more of a Common aspect of many European comics.

306
00:21:37,218 --> 00:21:41,011
Scott: I think it is so of course this also being a European comic What's it?

307
00:21:41,071 --> 00:21:43,922
Scott: but Bilal did this one right Bilal and Kristen?

308
00:21:44,122 --> 00:21:46,170
Rym: Yeah, I think Bilal did the writing.

309
00:21:48,953 --> 00:21:51,789
Scott: Yes, Bilal is incredibly famous artist you're talking about.

310
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,884
Scott: But yeah Speaking of incredibly famous artists, of course It's Bilal, so, you know why he's incredibly famous?

311
00:21:58,924 --> 00:21:59,950
Scott: because he's incredibly good.

312
00:22:00,451 --> 00:22:06,430
Rym: It's a really sort of gritty washed out almost watercolor looking style with really like thin black lines.

313
00:22:06,651 --> 00:22:07,835
Rym: Yeah, I really like that.

314
00:22:08,437 --> 00:22:09,100
Scott: It's pretty amazing.

315
00:22:09,842 --> 00:22:11,870
Scott: But yeah, I didn't you know, I wasn't that tied up in it?

316
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:12,893
Scott: I'd also don't?

317
00:22:13,234 --> 00:22:17,950
Scott: I only read this mere weeks ago and I read this like a year ago.

318
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,899
Scott: Yeah, and I remember it starkly.

319
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,030
Scott: Yeah, I remember it kind of.

320
00:22:23,957 --> 00:22:25,910
Scott: It shows how much of an impression it made on me.

321
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:29,363
Rym: All right, Scott, how many characters from the in call can you name?

322
00:22:29,383 --> 00:22:33,942
Rym: because you just read that - okay The main guy is John DeFool.

323
00:22:33,962 --> 00:22:34,966
Scott: I can't forget that name.

324
00:22:35,006 --> 00:22:39,941
Scott: Yeah, right There's the gray bird thingy, which name is I forget.

325
00:22:40,101 --> 00:22:42,467
Scott: All right, you can't forget meta Baron.

326
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:45,348
Scott: That's an amazing name total badass, dude.

327
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:50,810
Scott: There's meta Baron son, which is yellow hair greatest American hero fro kid.

328
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:56,396
Scott: The in call is sort of a character This animal girl.

329
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,266
Scott: I forget nature girl.

330
00:22:58,286 --> 00:23:00,716
Scott: I forget her name Her sister.

331
00:23:00,776 --> 00:23:01,502
Scott: I forget her name.

332
00:23:01,522 --> 00:23:03,515
Rym: Oh What was it?

333
00:23:03,978 --> 00:23:05,990
Rym: I'll probably remember half her through the show, but I'll say it now.

334
00:23:06,533 --> 00:23:08,226
Scott: I was reading a president guy.

335
00:23:08,266 --> 00:23:08,790
Scott: forget his name.

336
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:20,193
Rym: I was reading a comic that I read before again not that long ago and I was like Desperately reminded of the in call and I got to find out if the person who wrote this more recent comic was inspired by the The more recent kind.

337
00:23:20,353 --> 00:23:21,196
Rym: I forgot.

338
00:23:21,256 --> 00:23:25,027
Rym: that's why I said I'm gonna remember helping here and I'm gonna go oh shit this.

339
00:23:25,107 --> 00:23:31,771
Rym: but anyway, okay So the ranks of the black or I think the reason I like it so much and why I'm kind of hyping it a little Bit.

340
00:23:32,393 --> 00:23:36,790
Rym: is that any comic that tells a story from start to finish?

341
00:23:37,491 --> 00:23:50,150
Rym: with no sequels no prequels no greater universe and Also simultaneously is serious and good Gets kind of like a plus 20 to the role of will Rym like it over any other comic.

342
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,503
Scott: It's like half the comics I own.

343
00:23:51,524 --> 00:23:59,216
Scott: I know It seems like you haven't read that many comics that fit that category I have and all of them I on the show.

344
00:23:59,257 --> 00:24:00,140
Rym: him like it was great.

345
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:00,882
Scott: There are many.

346
00:24:00,943 --> 00:24:02,067
Rym: it was so great.

347
00:24:02,247 --> 00:24:02,508
Scott: Okay?

348
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:10,373
Rym: So wait what this is about to to put it very simply is the Spanish Civil War Sucked.

349
00:24:10,855 --> 00:24:13,404
Scott: no, like it was a war that sucked.

350
00:24:14,147 --> 00:24:14,950
Scott: What is that good for?

351
00:24:16,111 --> 00:24:20,824
Rym: Hey, what about those old like kind of fun sounding Greek wars where they'd kind of fight?

352
00:24:21,064 --> 00:24:25,790
Scott: mercenaries would fight the real ones Or the mythological one the semi-real ones.

353
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,698
Scott: But it was my real completely real.

354
00:24:27,778 --> 00:24:30,350
Rym: or as in like two mercenary armies would fight.

355
00:24:30,711 --> 00:24:36,370
Rym: But the mercenaries were kind of friends with each other and would try not to kill each other and they'd sort of declare a winner.

356
00:24:37,339 --> 00:24:38,208
Rym: It's more like a game.

357
00:24:39,598 --> 00:24:40,290
Scott: You mean fencing?

358
00:24:41,511 --> 00:24:43,436
Rym: No, yeah anyway, right.

359
00:24:43,736 --> 00:25:04,788
Rym: but so yeah the Spanish Civil War was particularly shitty because one it kind of happened with this backdrop of the world between World War one and World War two and during World War two and the aftermath of World War Two and two it was pretty much two groups fighting mostly for the wrong reasons.

360
00:25:05,995 --> 00:25:19,161
Rym: It was to paraphrase history Communists Anarchists and Republicans in a loose alliance fighting against fascists Nationalists and people who just wanted everything to be calm.

361
00:25:19,181 --> 00:25:25,263
Rym: It wasn't a Spanish monarchy still around then Yes, and there was a military coup and Franco.

362
00:25:25,363 --> 00:25:27,250
Rym: and do you know a lot about Spain?

363
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:34,965
Scott: most of my Spanish history knowledge is of Inquisition days, but pretty much what I know about the Spanish Civil War.

364
00:25:35,006 --> 00:25:36,030
Rym: So the Reconquista?

365
00:25:36,251 --> 00:25:39,870
Scott: Yes, also, I am well aware of issues in the Basque Country.

366
00:25:40,775 --> 00:25:49,605
Rym: So the Spanish Civil War ending Basically meant open warfare stopped but grudges were maintained and villages were destroyed.

367
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:53,581
Rym: Spain had its own army shelling its own cities at many points.

368
00:25:54,224 --> 00:25:55,189
Rym: It's a shitty war.

369
00:25:55,209 --> 00:26:03,030
Rym: and this story takes place long after the Spanish Civil War is over and A lot of people who fought in it are old men and women.

370
00:26:03,733 --> 00:26:16,683
Rym: So it opens with a bunch of these old men Coming into a small Basque village in the middle of nowhere in the middle of winter Systematically murdering every man woman and child in the town and burning it down.

371
00:26:16,703 --> 00:26:26,508
Scott: whenever there's one of those villages in the middle of nowhere I'm somehow Reminded I don't know why of that Lupin movie where there's the village with all the treasures in the middle of nowhere.

372
00:26:26,569 --> 00:26:26,990
Scott: That's empty.

373
00:26:27,313 --> 00:26:30,066
Rym: Yeah, I am too Huh?

374
00:26:30,992 --> 00:26:34,327
Rym: Can watch that Lupin again, which one was it fuck if I remember?

375
00:26:34,367 --> 00:26:35,010
Rym: but I've got it.

376
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,170
Rym: Yeah, which one, you know, this is totally an aside.

377
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:43,722
Rym: But now that I've got that torrent of every Lupin ever I was looking through the nail like I think like out of the blue.

378
00:26:44,003 --> 00:26:47,495
Scott: how many Lupin which is the one resented gotta lose this Job, I remember.

379
00:26:47,716 --> 00:26:51,490
Rym: but if I try to think like how many discreet Lupin movies have I seen?

380
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:55,797
Rym: I'm like, I don't know six or seven, but then I look at this list I'm like most of that.

381
00:26:55,838 --> 00:26:57,790
Rym: seen that seen that seen that yeah.

382
00:26:58,578 --> 00:27:08,390
Rym: But anyway, so the other old men Who find out about this who also, you know fought in this day band together?

383
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,736
Rym: And so it's basically two Blues Brothers situations.

384
00:27:11,137 --> 00:27:22,411
Rym: two groups get the band back together to sort of reenact the Spanish Civil War Long after the Spanish Civil War was done and long after all of them were in any shape to be going about this sort of business Right.

385
00:27:22,431 --> 00:27:28,322
Scott: Well, it's basically, you know, two two different rival groups fought back in the day But then the war ended.

386
00:27:28,382 --> 00:27:29,290
Scott: so they all went home.

387
00:27:29,651 --> 00:27:32,923
Scott: But then one of them got the band back together and started killing people.

388
00:27:33,224 --> 00:27:34,950
Scott: the other group found out about it.

389
00:27:35,151 --> 00:27:39,310
Scott: So they had to get their band back together to counteract the band that already got back together.

390
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:50,150
Rym: But it has this sort of undertone that the they're not the main characters the you know So-called good guys who were Republican anarchist communist fighters fighting for the Republic during the Spanish Civil War.

391
00:27:51,335 --> 00:27:58,790
Rym: they Don't really say they're fighting to save lives or to stop the plot by the other old men.

392
00:27:59,572 --> 00:28:02,241
Rym: They're really fighting just because that's what you do.

393
00:28:02,261 --> 00:28:05,030
Rym: Yeah, I mean those guys are fighting again.

394
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:06,054
Rym: So what can we do?

395
00:28:06,134 --> 00:28:06,837
Rym: but stop them.

396
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:08,424
Scott: who else is gonna stop them?

397
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:09,267
Scott: It's like.

398
00:28:09,448 --> 00:28:13,649
Scott: it's like, you know It's like who can they go to to tell anyone about them?

399
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:17,170
Scott: It's you know, it's like they can't just go and say hey military stop those guys.

400
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:17,692
Scott: It's like.

401
00:28:17,893 --> 00:28:26,647
Scott: well in the modern, you know, you know, they know those guys more than anyone else true But in there's they know who it was, they can't really prove who it was, but they know 100% Yes.

402
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:34,250
Rym: But in this world, they could they could have been formed the police and there was a much more modern framework of justice.

403
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:36,457
Scott: Yes, but also there's a scene.

404
00:28:36,577 --> 00:28:40,569
Scott: but also they would themselves be in trouble uncovering their own things.

405
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:44,670
Rym: Those things are so far in the past that it wouldn't have mattered nearly so much.

406
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,742
Rym: I think they're all respectable people in the modern era.

407
00:28:46,882 --> 00:28:55,330
Scott: Yes while they're respectable though It's one of those typical situations where you had a life of horrible danger Who knows what and then you you know, it ended and you went to a normal life.

408
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:58,509
Scott: But really that normal life you never really wanted that.

409
00:28:58,549 --> 00:29:03,030
Rym: no Yeah, that's that's what I'm saying that they could have responded to this in a very common story.

410
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:05,263
Rym: But rather than saying we're the only ones who can do it.

411
00:29:05,303 --> 00:29:09,624
Rym: We got to save these people Their response was basically stop those fuckers.

412
00:29:09,764 --> 00:29:11,030
Scott: Those are our rivals.

413
00:29:11,171 --> 00:29:11,918
Scott: We must beat them.

414
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:12,160
Scott: and

415
00:29:12,201 --> 00:29:34,830
Rym: it was a story of these people falling back into the roles that they fell into during the first war and it sort of puts the Futility and just absolute pointless waste of human life that the first Spanish Civil War was against this sort of second shadow war of old men fighting against shadows of other old men and It's pretty much just brutal and depressing all the way to the end.

416
00:29:35,051 --> 00:29:41,844
Scott: The thing I like about it the most is how they never you know Forget at all that these are really old people right like.

417
00:29:41,884 --> 00:29:46,747
Rym: they're way old 60 70 I mean, they try to get away on some bikes at one point and they can't.

418
00:29:47,993 --> 00:29:51,088
Rym: Guys die of heart attacks right aneurysms.

419
00:29:51,309 --> 00:29:56,430
Scott: Yep It's like, you know one guy's got like diseased all the time and some of them like the guy who jumps into the water.

420
00:29:56,551 --> 00:29:57,616
Rym: He was doing pretty well.

421
00:29:57,636 --> 00:30:02,059
Scott: Well, I think he was a little younger too, right dude the machine gun I like to yeah, but they were in very.

422
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,453
Scott: they were had varying ranges of physical fitness Just like old people are.

423
00:30:05,493 --> 00:30:05,955
Scott: there's a dude.

424
00:30:05,975 --> 00:30:07,921
Scott: I see freaking almost every morning.

425
00:30:08,222 --> 00:30:08,563
Scott: He must.

426
00:30:08,583 --> 00:30:10,028
Scott: he looks like fucking James Randi.

427
00:30:10,048 --> 00:30:10,650
Scott: He's so old.

428
00:30:10,952 --> 00:30:23,956
Rym: He's just freaking running down second Avenue man, and there I'll see dudes who are easily more than 80 years old skiing faster and better than I am on much harder trails that I could ever even dream of attempting.

429
00:30:24,237 --> 00:30:24,518
Scott: right.

430
00:30:24,578 --> 00:30:29,901
Scott: but I mean isn't more of skiing like skill and muscle memory than it would be say Strength and not that you don't need strength.

431
00:30:29,942 --> 00:30:31,350
Rym: Yeah, but there there is strength involved.

432
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:36,810
Scott: Practicing would help more but runnings just straight-up running around the city this dude.

433
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:41,368
Rym: Ah, there is evidence that humans are primed to be able to run for the entirety of their lives.

434
00:30:41,588 --> 00:30:44,363
Scott: That's good Yeah, but I mean a lot of old people can't even fucking walk.

435
00:30:44,424 --> 00:30:45,510
Scott: So that's still badass.

436
00:30:46,671 --> 00:30:53,430
Scott: Anyway, you know it never forgets that these guys are old and they're constantly suffering old people things all the time.

437
00:30:53,774 --> 00:31:00,630
Rym: It's like a scene of action That's kind of sad and oldie on both sides and then a scene of them having to recover from the act.

438
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:03,790
Scott: Yeah, it's like what would it be like if old geezers are really chasing each other?

439
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:22,905
Scott: What would it be like if old geezers are really shooting at each other, but it's not chasing each other like get back here Shutty, it's like no, they're actually chasing each other, but both sides are old guys and they both have guns Or motorcycles or whatever they've got but they're all old and not they can't go so fast And there aren't really any young people involved to just come and hose them all down.

440
00:31:22,925 --> 00:31:34,084
Scott: Yeah, so It's uh, it makes you think you know and at the one hand it, you know It's got that side plot of making you, you know, think about seniordom in your future.

441
00:31:34,345 --> 00:31:34,565
Rym: Yep,

442
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,270
Scott: but if you make it that far

443
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:53,588
Rym: The only complaint I guess I could have about this entire story Is that the moral at the end and the way it's presented and the you know The message trying to get through is a really good message Except that the guys that these guys are trying to stop are Clearly bad guys.

444
00:31:54,071 --> 00:32:02,920
Rym: Yeah, and the guys that tried to stop them while the conflict in the Spanish Civil War You know from a zoomed out perspective was pretty pointless and a waste of life.

445
00:32:03,482 --> 00:32:14,395
Rym: the direct conflict here while it could have been handled better Was straight up a good thing to do if they truly believe that no one would have done it a different way But it was still a good thing to do.

446
00:32:14,416 --> 00:32:18,290
Rym: Yeah, they're straight-up good guys, and it's not a bad if you're an old man.

447
00:32:18,391 --> 00:32:21,107
Rym: It's not a bad way to go dying to save a whole bunch of lives.

448
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:32,189
Scott: Yeah I mean, it's like, you know, usually you would expect there'd be some sort of ambiguity like, you know Two groups of old guys come up to fight again years later, you know, and you're the story.

449
00:32:32,229 --> 00:32:35,430
Scott: whatever, you know Whether it's a movie or TV show focuses on one of those groups.

450
00:32:35,772 --> 00:32:38,930
Scott: So identify with that group and that group becomes the quote good guys.

451
00:32:39,311 --> 00:32:43,810
Scott: But in reality at the end, you know the message is like oh look both of these sides were the same.

452
00:32:43,871 --> 00:32:45,250
Scott: We just had the camera on one of them.

453
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:50,190
Scott: So you thought that one was the good one, but really they were identical and just at opposing viewpoints.

454
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:56,170
Scott: But no the friggin beginning of the book is the first group that got the band back together.

455
00:32:56,571 --> 00:32:58,317
Scott: Frickin murders a town of people.

456
00:32:58,357 --> 00:33:02,010
Scott: They're they're crazy evil terrorists who go around murdering.

457
00:33:02,632 --> 00:33:15,149
Scott: They are bad guys regardless of whether you agree with one political ideology of the other And you probably also agree with the political ideology of the main characters anyway Because it doesn't involve terrorism.

458
00:33:16,074 --> 00:33:26,770
Rym: But you know, for example, there's that scene in the market where they try to stop the assassination and they have a shootout and You know, the police actually show up pretty quick like the tip-off could have worked.

459
00:33:27,655 --> 00:33:31,110
Rym: But through that whole scene all I could think was counter-strike.

460
00:33:33,292 --> 00:33:34,918
Scott: It wasn't in Italy though, that was.

461
00:33:34,938 --> 00:33:36,284
Rym: was it that far was?

462
00:33:36,304 --> 00:33:38,453
Scott: I don't know I Forget.

463
00:33:38,514 --> 00:33:39,098
Scott: they were always.

464
00:33:39,198 --> 00:33:46,069
Scott: basically as far as I could remember in Generic European place is not the market from counter-strike it is.

465
00:33:46,812 --> 00:33:52,820
Rym: But I mean, you know, but no this is a great little comic and I don't know how easy it is to get But I found it on Amazon with one review.

466
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:59,345
Scott: So all right, it is Theoretically obtainable and we're revving can't obtain it.

467
00:33:59,385 --> 00:34:10,873
Rym: go to Zumba calm where the unattainable is attainable, so There's probably only about a week's more worth of GeekNights episodes before.

468
00:34:10,934 --> 00:34:19,010
Rym: who knows that the fuck's gonna happen between me going back to Turkey and Scott going to DC and all of us going to Seattle?

469
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:23,204
Rym: Let me look and I might have to go to Munich again and maybe Frankfurt.

470
00:34:23,324 --> 00:34:24,869
Rym: Okay, baby Warsaw.

471
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:26,337
Scott: Yes That's Rym is about right.

472
00:34:26,357 --> 00:34:28,350
Scott: There's gonna be pretty much next week.

473
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:31,440
Scott: There will be I guess a Tuesday Thursday episodes.

474
00:34:31,541 --> 00:34:33,328
Scott: now several of you and then after that.

475
00:34:33,408 --> 00:34:33,909
Scott: who knows?

476
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:36,750
Rym: I've gotten some responses already on people who want to do guest episodes.

477
00:34:36,953 --> 00:34:47,170
Rym: So by this weekend I will get to all of you who have asked a care package of everything you will need to make a Episode of GeekNights, you'll get to our sound clips.

478
00:34:47,993 --> 00:34:50,402
Rym: No, these sound clips will not tell you what the songs are.

479
00:34:50,442 --> 00:34:54,708
Rym: you still have to figure those out except our opening theme Which is booster Tarantino used with permission.

480
00:34:56,272 --> 00:34:58,123
Scott: The other songs aren't used with permission.

481
00:34:58,203 --> 00:34:59,148
Rym: No, they're totally not.

482
00:35:01,091 --> 00:35:03,909
Rym: Fair use is what I will argue to the grave.

483
00:35:05,274 --> 00:35:06,566
Scott: The grave is a really end up.

484
00:35:07,753 --> 00:35:08,925
Scott: You're homeless and they see.

485
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:15,624
Rym: I Hope I don't look like any of the characters in this comic when I'm that old.

486
00:35:16,106 --> 00:35:21,810
Scott: Oh, yeah also atomic trivia war 9,000 is recording tomorrow with me again.

487
00:35:21,991 --> 00:35:26,128
Scott: Oh shit, but then I guess it's gonna air a week later or a week after that.

488
00:35:26,168 --> 00:35:26,490
Scott: Who knows?

489
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:27,533
Rym: I don't know when they're.

490
00:35:27,573 --> 00:35:32,334
Rym: I was on one a long time ago, but I forgot about it after I've been on two so this will be number three.

Scott: even only having been on two episodes.

493
00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:52,690
Rym: I am among the greatest Trivia, I wish it was more quiz bully though because I got to say when I was on I knew a lot of the answers to other people's baby questions.

494
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:59,980
Scott: Yeah, pretty much what it comes down to for me is if it is a topic that's like something I do not know like Star Trek questions.

495
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,090
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna fail this big time, right?

496
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:05,332
Scott: Cuz I don't know Star Trek, but if it's something I know Watch out.
