1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,824
Rym: It's Thursday October 18th 2012.

2
00:00:12,824 --> 00:00:19,074
Rym: Scott doesn't seem to be mad anymore than I say the year every time we do an opener And this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:20,360
Rym: What are we talking about Scott?

4
00:00:23,021 --> 00:00:23,698
Rym: Can't catch your tongue.

5
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:28,770
Rym: We're talking about real haunted houses.

6
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,240
Scott: I still get mad that you say too many words for the title part.

7
00:00:33,147 --> 00:00:34,399
Rym: Why would you be mad about that?

8
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:36,859
Scott: You should have just said tonight haunted houses.

9
00:00:37,342 --> 00:00:39,752
Scott: Instead you went on and we're still going on.

10
00:00:39,812 --> 00:00:40,314
Scott: so skip it.

11
00:00:40,475 --> 00:00:41,298
Rym: Are we still going on?

12
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:41,780
Scott: Are we?

13
00:00:42,362 --> 00:00:44,032
Rym: We're uh, actually yeah, the music's still playing.

14
00:00:44,274 --> 00:00:44,777
Scott: Fuck your face.

15
00:00:44,898 --> 00:00:49,018
Scott: Okay anyway Let's do this.

16
00:00:50,042 --> 00:00:55,164
Rym: So I finally many of you might have seen the movie Brazil The Terry Gilliam one?

17
00:00:55,204 --> 00:00:59,457
Rym: Yes, the movie about what happens when bureaucracy becomes too powerful.

18
00:00:59,497 --> 00:01:00,420
Rym: So it's a good movie.

19
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,043
Rym: You should all see it.

20
00:01:01,907 --> 00:01:03,956
Rym: While it's a classic and I really really like it.

21
00:01:04,016 --> 00:01:09,735
Rym: I will not pretend That it could not have used an editor and is not perhaps about 40 minutes too long.

22
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:17,340
Scott: It's got problems But like, you know, I mean I can see why it's like a cult classic and why there's people who are big fans of it.

23
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,614
Rym: I also respect it as a movie a great deal, but personally not gonna.

24
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:25,498
Rym: I don't enjoy watching it at all I enjoy watching pieces of it.

25
00:01:26,741 --> 00:01:31,739
Rym: But anyway, so I lived through a Brazilian scenario that I will now relate to you all.

26
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:34,390
Rym: so Almost one year ago today.

27
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:42,177
Rym: I received a notification That my taxes both federal and state had not been processed.

28
00:01:42,237 --> 00:01:44,364
Scott: didn't use turbo tax Back then.

29
00:01:44,444 --> 00:01:47,213
Rym: no, it wasn't my taxes from any recent year.

30
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:47,955
Rym: Mmm.

31
00:01:48,176 --> 00:01:49,601
Rym: It was my taxes from like 2009 or 2008.

32
00:01:49,601 --> 00:01:51,209
Rym: I forget it's already okay.

33
00:01:53,901 --> 00:01:59,518
Rym: so I did some follow-up stuff and the feds responded right away and they're like, yeah for whatever reason we didn't get it.

34
00:01:59,538 --> 00:02:02,320
Scott: and Why did it take you this long to say something?

35
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,585
Rym: Yeah, I didn't matter cuz both the feds and the state owed me a tiny bit of money So it didn't even matter.

36
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:11,700
Rym: It's like, alright, so I never got my five bucks or whatever.

37
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:23,860
Rym: but don't you to pay a fine for not filing into on time, so I Investigated and I discovered that I had in fact filed my taxes through H&R block and those pig fuckers just fucked it up somehow.

38
00:02:25,301 --> 00:02:32,450
Rym: So I called them and they start to help me and they're like, wait a minute It looks like you used in a free e-file.

39
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:34,778
Rym: I was like, yes, they're like we don't support those.

40
00:02:34,818 --> 00:02:35,420
Rym: they hung up on me.

41
00:02:38,021 --> 00:02:53,900
Rym: So all I had was the receipt showing that I had paid them to do my fat my state return which they also didn't support cuz I did it as part as a free e-file or whatever right and I had the email receipt stating that I had in fact done my taxes.

42
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:59,679
Rym: So I put together I put that in an email and I sent it back to the feds like I did file him.

43
00:03:01,141 --> 00:03:01,824
Rym: Here's the evidence.

44
00:03:01,885 --> 00:03:03,392
Rym: I have no response.

45
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:06,543
Rym: Okay, so Maybe I don't know.

46
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:09,010
Rym: a week before taxes were due for this current year.

47
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:15,428
Rym: I got two letters one for the feds that were like You've got to file these taxes.

48
00:03:15,468 --> 00:03:16,493
Rym: you never filed them.

49
00:03:16,955 --> 00:03:21,537
Rym: They basically ignored the letter Of course and the state sent me a similar letter.

50
00:03:21,778 --> 00:03:35,864
Rym: Hmm So I refiled my federal taxes by hand from 2009. so I dug up all my old fucking documents and I calculated everything and I sent the the 1040 and all that business and Several months later.

51
00:03:35,884 --> 00:03:37,951
Rym: I got a response back that said all good.

52
00:03:38,172 --> 00:03:38,533
Rym: You're set.

53
00:03:38,834 --> 00:03:40,600
Scott: Everything was fine from the state of the feds feds.

54
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:43,799
Scott: Okay, so New York State, New York State.

55
00:03:45,442 --> 00:03:46,349
Rym: So see this coming.

56
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,880
Rym: I sent them the same thing.

57
00:03:48,141 --> 00:03:50,912
Rym: I redid the taxes and I just sent him and everything was good.

58
00:03:50,932 --> 00:03:52,840
Rym: and then I got a letter back.

59
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,120
Rym: I guess they either never got or never processed the reef, you know, the paperwork I sent in again.

60
00:03:57,301 --> 00:03:58,840
Scott: Well, you saved that so you could do.

61
00:04:00,326 --> 00:04:03,037
Rym: And what I got was this innocuous letter that I ignored for a while.

62
00:04:03,057 --> 00:04:06,320
Rym: cuz they get a lot of mail I don't read it that often because there's never anything important.

63
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:10,593
Rym: So I opened this letter and it's like you never filed your state taxes.

64
00:04:10,613 --> 00:04:12,920
Rym: You lot of da-da-da you owe us.

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,169
Rym: I'm like, all right, they're probably gonna find me.

66
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,077
Rym: I'll just pay it and it'll be done.

67
00:04:15,137 --> 00:04:21,435
Rym: It's like And I'm like what fuck you What?

68
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:32,656
Rym: What If it had been like even a few hundred dollars, I would have been like, all right I probably should have like gotten a lawyer probably shouldn't use agent our blog.

69
00:04:32,696 --> 00:04:36,455
Scott: Yeah, that's the more That's you get me for the easy free file.

70
00:04:36,475 --> 00:04:37,180
Scott: You get we deserve.

71
00:04:37,222 --> 00:04:40,643
Rym: Yeah I've been using turbo to our quicken actually since then with Marry.

72
00:04:40,683 --> 00:04:41,205
Rym: a problem.

73
00:04:41,246 --> 00:04:42,130
Scott: quicken is turbo.

74
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,416
Scott: text the same companies into it.

75
00:04:43,577 --> 00:04:44,260
Rym: Oh, yeah, you're right.

76
00:04:44,704 --> 00:04:46,080
Rym: In fact with into it.

77
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:50,359
Rym: I actually got a ridiculous refund this year because I made enough money to get a tax credit.

78
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:53,799
Rym: that was Basically, I got one of those rich person tax credits and I felt really dirty.

79
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:57,137
Scott: But at the same time you wouldn't say no to that.

80
00:04:57,177 --> 00:05:01,353
Rym: who would Cuz me not saying no is not gonna fix the problem.

81
00:05:01,955 --> 00:05:04,141
Rym: Anyway, so I Get this.

82
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,429
Rym: I'm like, alright, I have to do something.

83
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:07,734
Rym: I can't just ignore this.

84
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:09,600
Scott: Yeah, otherwise you go to jail.

85
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,272
Rym: Am I going to pay this?

86
00:05:11,595 --> 00:05:12,300
Scott: of course not?

87
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:18,640
Rym: So I go through this Document over the course of like a week because I don't have a lot of time in my free time, you know my life.

88
00:05:19,162 --> 00:05:28,111
Rym: so I sit down like every day for like an hour and I go over this gigantic document they sent me and Basically, they saw that I had they actually recorded that

89
00:05:28,171 --> 00:05:29,496
Scott: I had paid them

90
00:05:29,677 --> 00:05:35,536
Rym: money in taxes And they recorded the money I had included in the check because I think in the state.

91
00:05:35,557 --> 00:05:36,119
Rym: I think I was wrong.

92
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:39,480
Rym: earlier The feds owed me money, but I owed the state like five or six bucks.

93
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,408
Rym: So I'd written him a check and they had that.

94
00:05:41,468 --> 00:05:45,630
Rym: they just didn't have the return that was with the check But that didn't.

95
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:46,639
Rym: that evidence didn't help me.

96
00:05:47,262 --> 00:06:00,196
Rym: so eventually I discovered after trying to read this whole fucking thing that They had calculated what they thought my taxes were on their own Mm-hmm, and because I live in New York City.

97
00:06:00,317 --> 00:06:07,280
Rym: now They assumed I'd always lived in New York City when in fact in 2009 I did not live in New York City.

98
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:14,926
Rym: So the itemized thing basically said like you owed, you know, four or five, you know I think it was like five thousand something dollars.

99
00:06:15,488 --> 00:06:18,900
Rym: This is the state that you didn't pay because basically you paid zero city tax.

100
00:06:19,362 --> 00:06:22,296
Scott: Yeah, and they wanted the city tax and they were like, what do you the city?

101
00:06:22,376 --> 00:06:23,080
Scott: as for the city tax?

102
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,384
Rym: No, no, the state handles that.

103
00:06:24,525 --> 00:06:26,231
Rym: Okay, so and then they're like.

104
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:32,716
Rym: and because you didn't pay it by this deadline There's a 10% penalty and because you didn't pay it by this egregious deadline.

105
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:41,940
Rym: You owe a 100% like egregious whatever penalty on the interest and the engine and it totally was pushing 10 grand by the end.

106
00:06:42,947 --> 00:06:54,512
Rym: so I redid my taxes following their formula which includes all the penalties for filing late and They actually ended up owing me money.

107
00:06:54,532 --> 00:06:58,979
Rym: Mm-hmm if I lived Where I lived instead of in New York City.

108
00:06:59,843 --> 00:07:17,199
Rym: So I sent them back an envelope filled with I think 30 pages of documentary evidence that I did not live in nor even have a residence in New York City for the entirety of 2009 and this included like pay stubs from the beginning of the year the middle of the year the end of the year.

109
00:07:17,921 --> 00:07:21,230
Rym: utility bills a utility bill one of my I think.

110
00:07:21,271 --> 00:07:24,259
Rym: I put a copy of the lease from the house we used to live in.

111
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:33,959
Rym: I Put all this bullshit together and I included this huge huge document that itemized like Article number one assuming a human is ever gonna look at this.

112
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:46,376
Rym: yeah, so I sent this whole thing off certified mail signature, whatever and I decided that that's the best I can do and I Expected nothing to happen and then like a year later to get fucked with like a $40,000 bill or something.

113
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:51,436
Scott: Yeah, and you know, I probably should have gotten a lawyer but I didn't have brought tax lawyer.

114
00:07:51,456 --> 00:07:54,909
Rym: Yeah, so I Have a little bit of faith in America.

115
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:58,669
Rym: now it worked because a week ago I got a letter from New York State.

116
00:07:58,891 --> 00:07:59,575
Rym: Emily hands it to me.

117
00:07:59,595 --> 00:08:00,058
Rym: It's in the mail.

118
00:08:00,098 --> 00:08:00,460
Rym: I look at it.

119
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,525
Rym: I'm like, all right.

120
00:08:01,726 --> 00:08:02,670
Rym: This is when they fuck me.

121
00:08:03,253 --> 00:08:04,680
Rym: This is this is all over for him.

122
00:08:05,062 --> 00:08:07,480
Rym: I'm gonna have to give up my nice apartment gonna go to jail.

123
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:10,300
Rym: I open it and they're like and it's just literally two sentences.

124
00:08:11,181 --> 00:08:13,131
Rym: We reviewed the documents you provided.

125
00:08:13,152 --> 00:08:21,662
Rym: you now owe The following and then it listed this huge itemized bill and every item on it was zero dollars Mm-hmm.

126
00:08:22,865 --> 00:08:27,878
Rym: So here's the open question that zero dollar bill has a due date.

127
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:32,100
Rym: Yep Should I send a check for zero dollars?

128
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,539
Rym: Nothing, you should send a check for zero dollars, but I think I think I came out on top.

129
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,525
Rym: So I feel like I feel like it worked out.

130
00:08:38,787 --> 00:08:42,337
Rym: Okay, the moral don't fucking use H&R block for anything.

131
00:08:42,357 --> 00:08:42,860
Rym: They will fuck.

132
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:43,977
Scott: Why would you do that?

133
00:08:45,101 --> 00:08:46,436
Scott: Don't use any of those things.

134
00:08:48,241 --> 00:08:49,485
Scott: This is the same thing, it's like.

135
00:08:49,505 --> 00:08:51,551
Scott: don't download the shady ass software.

136
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:55,707
Scott: don't do your taxes at the shady ass tax, dude It was 2009.

137
00:08:55,707 --> 00:08:57,556
Rym: I didn't even make that much money back then.

138
00:08:57,597 --> 00:09:01,353
Scott: I'm just saying Anyway, anyway, that's your open event.

139
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:06,856
Rym: Well, actually according to the forum I did make a ton of money back then but that's a separate thread anyway, so I got some news.

140
00:09:06,876 --> 00:09:09,850

150
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:06,600
Scott: you know, you don't need to go and like buy the different dive housing to go deeper underwater.

151
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,147
Rym: I will never need the dive house.

152
00:10:08,187 --> 00:10:09,774
Scott: I'm just saying it's by default.

153
00:10:09,834 --> 00:10:11,160
Scott: No, cuz we're going to Australia.

154
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,449
Scott: Yeah, I'm just saying by default.

155
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,940
Scott: It's on there right on all of them.

156
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,595
Scott: So you don't need to get a set and the clamp on top is better.

157
00:10:16,635 --> 00:10:17,500
Scott: This is totally unrelated.

158
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:27,646
Rym: I saw a guy on the subway today walking along the subway while the train was going with a GoPro on a very similar Homemade steady cam to the one I have.

159
00:10:27,766 --> 00:10:27,987
Scott: Yep.

160
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:32,985
Scott: So this one only was only five megapixels of the quality not the best But it's $200.

161
00:10:32,985 --> 00:10:33,288
Scott: It's so cheap.

162
00:10:34,321 --> 00:10:37,440
Scott: It's sort of like getting a GoPro Hero 1 the original for magic.

163
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,960
Rym: We should tell Mike tool cuz he was just asking me like should I get a GoPro to film panels at conventions?

164
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,227
Scott: I saw I'm not done yet.

165
00:10:43,671 --> 00:10:45,304
Scott: There's the silver edition $300 racist basic.

166
00:10:45,325 --> 00:10:49,459
Scott: I Think that'd be ages.

167
00:10:52,221 --> 00:10:54,207
Scott: It's basically the same thing as the white edition.

168
00:10:54,548 --> 00:10:57,496
Scott: what so only it's $100 more but you made it 11 megapixels.

169
00:10:59,565 --> 00:11:00,773
Scott: Oh, so it's better.

170
00:11:00,995 --> 00:11:01,800
Scott: It's slightly better.

171
00:11:01,981 --> 00:11:05,938
Scott: It's basically the hero - only slightly better because again the housing is it.

172
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,530
Scott: but wait You said there's something bad and the Wi-Fi built-in.

173
00:11:08,871 --> 00:11:09,876
Rym: you said there's something bad.

174
00:11:10,218 --> 00:11:11,202
Scott: What was bad You said you?

175
00:11:11,242 --> 00:11:14,637
Rym: you implied that there was something not all great about the new GoPro.

176
00:11:14,878 --> 00:11:15,340
Scott: That's true.

177
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,728
Scott: You know what the bad thing about the silver edition is.

178
00:11:17,748 --> 00:11:21,380
Scott: it cost like $800 not the black edition, which is the best edition.

179
00:11:21,662 --> 00:11:24,100
Scott: Okay, black edition is $400.

180
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,830
Scott: It is 12 megapixels and check this.

181
00:11:28,351 --> 00:11:29,614
Scott: it has the Wi-Fi built in.

182
00:11:29,634 --> 00:11:33,971
Scott: it comes with a shammy The Wi-Fi remote control.

183
00:11:34,011 --> 00:11:35,719
Scott: so you don't even need to touch it to like turn it on.

184
00:11:36,742 --> 00:11:37,605
Scott: You can buy the room.

185
00:11:37,726 --> 00:11:41,080
Rym: I really wanted that for the GoPro - but it was too much money for how little I use.

186
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:48,220
Scott: Right, you can buy the remote separately for the other ones But you this one comes with the remote and the remote is 80 bucks on its own.

187
00:11:48,321 --> 00:11:51,932
Scott: So if you think about it The black edition is really only $20 more than the silver edition.

188
00:11:52,012 --> 00:12:00,690
Scott: that if you count the price of the remote it's 12 megapixels, so the quality there is slightly better than the silver edition, but Here's the craziness.

189
00:12:00,771 --> 00:12:19,185
Scott: Here it comes 720p not at 60 FPS like the other GoPros, but at 120 1080p at 60 which is It gets crazier 1440p at 48 frames a second.

190
00:12:19,827 --> 00:12:23,760
Rym: Oh, so it's doing those like 2k 4k like ultra HD 2.7.

191
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:31,187
Scott: K at 30 FPS and 4k at 12 FPS.

192
00:12:31,227 --> 00:12:32,794
Scott: So the 4k is good.

193
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:34,119
Scott: for like, you know the time lapses.

194
00:12:34,461 --> 00:12:37,554
Rym: You're not getting able to fit that much of that on a an SD card.

195
00:12:37,574 --> 00:12:38,820
Scott: get a really big SD card.

196
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:43,715
Scott: But also remember it has the Wi-Fi so you could have it be Wi-Fiing that too.

197
00:12:43,936 --> 00:12:47,747
Rym: Um, how much bandwidth Does Wi-Fi have?

198
00:12:47,887 --> 00:12:48,750
Scott: I'm saying use it.

199
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,798
Scott: just say for the time lapses the 4k.

200
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:58,903
Scott: Yeah, you want to just say you mostly you're gonna run this thing though at the 1080p 60 which is Insane.

201
00:12:58,923 --> 00:13:12,897
Scott: or if you want to do some image digital image stabilization or post-processing digital zoom Well, that was the other thing I was do the 14 do the 1440 or the 2.7 K at 4 48 or 30 FPS and then you could crop down to 1080p and you won't.

202
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,699
Scott: it'll be awesome Yeah, so for 400 bucks plus it includes a free remote.

203
00:13:18,901 --> 00:13:23,076
Scott: I'm thinking I'm gonna get one but in the spring and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put.

204
00:13:23,116 --> 00:13:30,795
Scott: it's gonna make my life miserable When it comes to editing together our stuff from conventions Oh and also all of these because there's so much smaller than the old GoPros.

205
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:35,012
Scott: use micro SD So you can get a 64 gig micro SD for this.

206
00:13:35,554 --> 00:13:42,319
Scott: I'm gonna put the Better one on the front of my bike and I'm gonna put my old one on the back and then double it up.

207
00:13:43,701 --> 00:13:46,814
Rym: I'm going to see how much I use my current GoPro cuz last year.

208
00:13:46,874 --> 00:13:48,360
Scott: I use it every fucking day.

209
00:13:48,902 --> 00:13:50,930
Rym: I don't anymore because the video.

210
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:54,607
Rym: so yes, I have what 40 videos of me biking to work Whoop-dee-doo.

211
00:13:54,707 --> 00:13:56,679
Scott: I can compile them into a really awesome video.

212
00:13:57,523 --> 00:14:02,887
Rym: My your commute must be a lot more exciting than mine, maybe My commutes also a half-hour long.

213
00:14:02,907 --> 00:14:05,840
Scott: You also gotta use the magic of video editing to make it look exciting.

214
00:14:06,101 --> 00:14:12,217
Rym: Nothing has ever happened on my GoPro in the entire time that I had it on my bike every day.

215
00:14:12,377 --> 00:14:16,664
Scott: one day the exciting will Happen and you'll have won't have the GoPro Have.

216
00:14:16,704 --> 00:14:21,200
Rym: the GoPro really is for skiing and last season I got a bunch of good okay videos.

217
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:28,127
Rym: But by the time I got the GoPro and got it going ski season was kind of over and the one time I went to A really good place or would have gotten good video.

218
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:31,600
Rym: It was like super snowy and you can't see anything in the video.

219
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:36,580
Scott: I've also learned techniques how to get more exciting shots with the GoPro that I wasn't getting.

220
00:14:36,661 --> 00:14:39,020
Scott: So now if I have a spare do riskier things.

221
00:14:39,261 --> 00:14:41,976
Scott: No, you put the camera in a in a better spot.

222
00:14:42,197 --> 00:14:42,760
Scott: That is clever.

223
00:14:43,523 --> 00:14:47,300
Rym: I picture Scott's not gonna have 40 videos of his crotch while he bikes.

224
00:14:49,109 --> 00:14:52,870
Rym: So My tool was asking, you know, he was like gosh.

225
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:55,000
Rym: I get a GoPro to record my panels.

226
00:14:55,542 --> 00:14:59,455
Rym: So it's about 400 bucks for the new good for this GoPro the super high-end one.

227
00:14:59,475 --> 00:15:02,465
Rym: Yeah for a Thousand bucks.

228
00:15:02,566 --> 00:15:03,412
Scott: That's a lot more than 400.

229
00:15:03,412 --> 00:15:07,948
Rym: You can get a camcorder That is way better quality than that.

230
00:15:07,988 --> 00:15:11,560
Rym: GoPro probably has a 300 gigabyte internal hard drive.

231
00:15:11,721 --> 00:15:15,497
Rym: Yeah, you can record like 20 hours of your panels, but does it do more than 1080p?

232
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,596
Rym: 60 you don't need that for a panel.

233
00:15:18,736 --> 00:15:19,219
Scott: That's true.

234
00:15:20,201 --> 00:15:25,418
Rym: 1080p 60 is plenty for two doofuses or one doofus up on a stage talking.

235
00:15:25,438 --> 00:15:25,900
Scott: It's true.

236
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:28,920
Rym: Also, the GoPro is low-light performance is probably not nearly as good.

237
00:15:29,141 --> 00:15:30,848
Rym: Dedicated can be black edition.

238
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,960
Scott: the high-end $400 has better light low-light performance.

239
00:15:34,121 --> 00:15:38,020
Rym: Every camera ever says it has better low-light performance than all previous does not say better.

240
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,789
Scott: It says pro low-light performance.

241
00:15:41,251 --> 00:15:45,425
Scott: So it's pro which means as good as row Row is.

242
00:15:45,465 --> 00:15:48,615
Rym: in fact, don't we only ever call people pros pejoratively?

243
00:15:48,635 --> 00:15:52,185
Rym: Yes, so I Have a question for you Scott.

244
00:15:52,426 --> 00:16:05,126
Rym: when you said that when I on the silver GoPro that that was a gist Were you making a joke because old people have silver hair or because the symbol for silver is a G Which joke were you making?

245
00:16:07,573 --> 00:16:09,579
Rym: I don't think you were making both jokes you don't think?

246
00:16:09,619 --> 00:16:10,282
Scott: so I don't.

247
00:16:10,322 --> 00:16:11,046
Scott: how do you not know?

248
00:16:11,066 --> 00:16:15,820
Scott: I got a hunch hunch because you're old So silvery.

249
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:21,100
Rym: This is something Scott and I talked about a lot on our own whenever it comes up because we actually have different opinions on it.

250
00:16:21,682 --> 00:16:26,099
Rym: So recently the government in New York, and actually there's a picture in this article.

251
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:33,600
Rym: That's right Government like the Federal Reserve like I walked past the Federal Reserve every day on my way to like Good Burger to get lunch.

252
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,596
Scott: Yeah, I was down there today.

253
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:35,984
Rym: Really were you?

254
00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:42,571
Rym: yeah, I was just there because I was over there Twice today both for work stuff and for other work stuff.

255
00:16:42,592 --> 00:16:46,546
Scott: I was there because I was going to 30 Broad Street So I was very close 30 broad.

256
00:16:46,586 --> 00:16:48,714
Rym: I've been in that building before for work stuff.

257
00:16:48,834 --> 00:16:50,320
Rym: Yeah, what were you doing there?

258
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,503
Scott: I was signing up for them.

259
00:16:51,523 --> 00:16:56,179
Scott: I had to go get fingerprinted so that oh Okay, the government can find me.

260
00:16:57,561 --> 00:16:59,026
Scott: Now I'm really can't commit any crimes.

261
00:16:59,146 --> 00:17:00,973
Scott: Yeah, because now I'm in a database.

262
00:17:01,414 --> 00:17:01,815
Rym: That's great.

263
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:04,002
Rym: I'm in one of those databases, too So don't worry about that.

264
00:17:04,061 --> 00:17:28,119
Rym: Yeah, so a dude was arrested for Buying fake bomb equipment from the FBI undercover FBI agents buying instructions asking them to help him Constructing something that he thought was a gigantic bomb Taking it to the Federal Reserve attempting Repeatedly to detonate it and he was arrested for conspiracy to terrorism and all that stuff.

265
00:17:30,035 --> 00:17:31,207
Rym: I'm actually okay with this.

266
00:17:34,392 --> 00:17:38,398
Scott: I Mean obviously, here's my rash.

267
00:17:38,478 --> 00:17:40,125
Scott: Obviously dude was pushing the button.

268
00:17:40,165 --> 00:17:41,310
Scott: He wanted to blow stuff up.

269
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:47,412
Rym: He's a crazy dude that before we even get to the the low-level argument is guilty of something I'm gonna make.

270
00:17:47,472 --> 00:17:49,717
Rym: I mean, let's make the philosophical argument first.

271
00:17:50,178 --> 00:17:54,228
Rym: if there's a person in a free society where there's free speech.

272
00:17:54,689 --> 00:17:54,849
Rym: who?

273
00:17:55,690 --> 00:18:01,070
Rym: Merely by being given the opportunity Will pretty much immediately attempt to commit mass murder.

274
00:18:02,812 --> 00:18:12,326
Rym: You can argue that the FBI in this case is basically acting as an antibody Provoking a response from a virus to then isolate and destroy it for the betterment of all society.

275
00:18:12,346 --> 00:18:13,148
Scott: Not a bad analogy.

276
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:16,076
Scott: So I Winning me over with the analogy.

277
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:19,510
Rym: I'm just saying I'm okay with that on a philosophical level.

278
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:33,190
Rym: However, I will agree right now that lupus exists and that we do not want it to turn into the autoimmune situation Where someone who actually wasn't a danger is tricked or coerced into doing something like that here.

279
00:18:33,271 --> 00:18:34,930
Scott: Let me hit you with my analogy, right?

280
00:18:35,471 --> 00:18:37,356
Scott: Crazy guy wants to kill someone.

281
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:37,897
Rym: Okay.

282
00:18:37,977 --> 00:18:38,499
Scott: He is.

283
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:41,467
Scott: he has a mentality of wanting to kill bad guy.

284
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:42,008
Scott: No question.

285
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,859
Scott: And right, there's clearly no question about this guy either.

286
00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:47,850
Scott: right goes to the store to buy a weapon, right?

287
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:52,364
Scott: All right, dude at the gun store sells him a Super Soaker and says yes.

288
00:18:52,826 --> 00:18:54,070
Scott: Yes, this will kill people.

289
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:57,608
Scott: The guy's just really dumb and he says okay and he goes and he shoots someone with water.

290
00:18:58,772 --> 00:19:05,571
Scott: Right now take a second guy same situation only buys a real gun and shoot somebody and kills them as opposed to shooting them With water.

291
00:19:05,591 --> 00:19:08,260
Scott: Yeah should not be water guy.

292
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,784
Scott: I think I'm.

293
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,068
Scott: you know, I'm not a lawyer.

294
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:20,489
Scott: obviously I would argue the water guy would be treated differently in court and receive a less sentence and a different He would be charged with a different crime.

295
00:19:20,671 --> 00:19:22,500
Scott: Now then the guy with the real guy.

296
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:36,245
Rym: if the guy if the gun shop sold him Something that looked and felt for all intents and purposes to be a real gun But was actually a squirt gun Then it would then he would probably be charged with attempted murder because he did attempt to murder.

297
00:19:36,265 --> 00:19:40,830
Scott: He was just incompetent No, but it's like but he didn't actually.

298
00:19:41,852 --> 00:19:44,664
Scott: No attempted murder the law didn't murder.

299
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,534
Scott: they can't charge him with murder That's clear.

300
00:19:46,654 --> 00:19:50,172
Rym: and they're not charging this guy with bombing That's true.

301
00:19:50,252 --> 00:19:53,641
Rym: charging him with attempted bombing and conspiracy to bomb.

302
00:19:53,962 --> 00:20:01,450
Rym: but if then she did commit both of those things I know but it's conspiracy to do something does not require you to actually do it.

303
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,525
Rym: If you do it, you also get charged with doing it.

304
00:20:04,545 --> 00:20:15,597
Scott: I know No, I still I just feel like this, you know, if we just if the FBI had not, you know set up this What would this guy have done?

305
00:20:15,637 --> 00:20:18,990
Rym: so probably no so so so this is the interesting part.

306
00:20:19,691 --> 00:20:24,190
Rym: That's why I brought up the anatomy because the high-level argument of philosophy and pragmatism and everything.

307
00:20:25,171 --> 00:20:26,818
Rym: There's an interesting debate to be had.

308
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,505
Scott: Was it entrapment of some kind?

309
00:20:28,566 --> 00:20:29,530
Scott: I don't you know, I don't know the legal.

310
00:20:30,951 --> 00:20:32,257
Scott: Don't come after me, please.

311
00:20:32,438 --> 00:20:37,930
Rym: I have the whole sequence of what happened here, but on the high level We're just talking about there's a good argument to be had and I can see both cases.

312
00:20:38,513 --> 00:20:44,942
Rym: my final counter argument before we move on to the details of this dude and where what you're about to bring up is that the.

313
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:48,778
Rym: How should I approach this?

314
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:50,143
Rym: I got a couple of ways I could argue.

315
00:20:50,163 --> 00:20:51,950
Rym: All right, so Charles Manson, right?

316
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,910
Rym: Yeah, didn't actually murder anyone.

317
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:54,391
Rym: That's true.

318
00:20:54,592 --> 00:21:00,490
Rym: bunch of stupid people were tricked basically convinced to murder on his behalf, but he told people to do something.

319
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,172
Scott: So did it.

320
00:21:01,213 --> 00:21:04,464
Scott: it's the same thing as Al Capone didn't kill anyone did he right?

321
00:21:04,484 --> 00:21:06,050
Scott: but he told people to kill people.

322
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:11,030
Scott: Ah, but so Charles Manson is equally guilty to Al Capone which is very very bad.

323
00:21:11,211 --> 00:21:13,310
Rym: But Al Capone was only guilty of tax evasion.

324
00:21:13,874 --> 00:21:14,981
Scott: That's all they could pin him on.

325
00:21:15,002 --> 00:21:16,230
Scott: just cuz he's good at hiding evidence.

326
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:23,439
Scott: Imagine if they could actually you know, if the evidence that Al Capone told people to kill people was readily available He would have been locked up like Charles Manson.

327
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:28,710
Rym: You can argue that the people who killed for Al Capone Were just shitty people doing their shitty mob.

328
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:34,912
Scott: I think the difference between Al Capone and Charles Manson was the Al Capone paid the people to do the killing whereas Charles Manson just Convinced them.

329
00:21:35,072 --> 00:21:41,290
Rym: Ah, but the people Charles Manson convinced were also charged with murder and arrested.

330
00:21:41,531 --> 00:21:46,050
Scott: Yes, and many of them Al Capone's people were all hitmen and they also would have gone to jail.

331
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:52,067
Rym: Could you not argue that we cannot eliminate the Charles Mansions before we identify him?

332
00:21:52,087 --> 00:21:54,999
Rym: and people like that are usually Clever enough to avoid detection.

333
00:21:55,441 --> 00:21:57,130
Scott: Well, the Al Capone was that's for sure.

334
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:09,803
Rym: But simultaneously the people who would commit the crimes on their behalf who are less intelligent and who are susceptible to these sorts of memes are Equally dangerous to society because it's very easy to get them to do bad things.

335
00:22:10,143 --> 00:22:12,450
Rym: a smart person could use them to murder by proxy.

336
00:22:13,253 --> 00:22:22,290
Rym: so should they not also be in some way either deactivated in terms of their willingness to go murder or somehow segregated from society?

337
00:22:22,611 --> 00:22:27,970
Scott: But if they if the bad people, you know out there, I understand your pragmatic viewpoint.

338
00:22:28,211 --> 00:22:40,770
Scott: But if the bad if that you know, there's probably plenty of people around the world, you know Who are those kind of susceptible people who simply have not encountered the Charles Manson Al Capone because those are actually very rare?

339
00:22:41,413 --> 00:22:52,090
Scott: Ah, so and those people are living their lives Perfectly happily and innocently because they have been lucky enough not to encounter but at the same time they are taking time bombs.

340
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:52,551
Rym: they are.

341
00:22:52,772 --> 00:23:06,519
Rym: would our society not be stronger if in addition to trying to stop bad people we did something to make the Average person less susceptible to that thereby being stronger as you are now Taking out these people who would have been innocent.

342
00:23:06,579 --> 00:23:07,382
Scott: Is that fair?

343
00:23:07,403 --> 00:23:08,687
Rym: Who says taking out?

344
00:23:08,707 --> 00:23:09,450
Rym: There's other ways to approach.

345
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,234
Scott: What do you do with them?

346
00:23:10,395 --> 00:23:12,404
Scott: So you you you have some system?

347
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:13,490
Scott: We don't know what the system is.

348
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:14,227
Scott: What if you have a system?

349
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:22,910
Scott: Hypothetically you identify you identify a person who would kill if they met a Charles Manson But they have not yet met one and there is not one in the area.

350
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,817
Scott: So maybe what do you do with that person?

351
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:34,670
Rym: Maybe you set up a system where those people are approached by Social workers to see like maybe to help them out to make them more some sort of like voluntary program.

352
00:23:35,223 --> 00:23:43,029
Scott: Oh, well that's different than tricking them into killing people and faking and becoming a Charles Manson tricking them into not actually killing someone and locking them.

353
00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:53,944
Rym: so this Dude, this particular dude apparently came to America Specifically to be a terrorist and was dedicating his entire life.

354
00:23:53,964 --> 00:23:55,650
Scott: How did he get in then toward this?

355
00:23:55,871 --> 00:23:57,608
Rym: Well, they let him in because they were following him.

356
00:23:58,531 --> 00:23:59,634
Rym: They'd been spying on me.

357
00:23:59,675 --> 00:24:01,440
Scott: Why did they just get him at the border?

358
00:24:02,243 --> 00:24:06,379
Rym: if they knew he hadn't committed anything yet They could they could have arrested him on basically nothing.

359
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:06,741
Rym: They had.

360
00:24:07,022 --> 00:24:08,710
Rym: they had all this evidence that he came here for it.

361
00:24:09,112 --> 00:24:12,070
Rym: So basically he put together a group of people to do it.

362
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:14,881
Scott: Why didn't they just get him with that evidence that he came here for it?

363
00:24:15,102 --> 00:24:16,910
Rym: because here's a better way they did.

364
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:26,290
Rym: But first they waited to be absolutely sure beyond any possible doubt that he would have done it that he wasn't just one of those You know guys who's loud and pissed off about stuff.

365
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:31,750
Rym: They wanted to make sure he was a dude who actually would get a bomb and actually try to detonate.

366
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:36,229
Scott: That is a good thing because there are plenty of loud pissed off people who I know on the Internet's.

367
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:36,390
Scott: who?

368
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:43,157
Scott: Probably if that if that was all it took to lock them up would be locked up even though they are perfectly innocent People who should not be in jail

369
00:24:43,257 --> 00:24:53,530
Rym: exactly so allegedly he came to the US with the intent of doing this Gathered up a posse of people and put together a plan to bomb buildings eventually settled on the Federal Reserve.

370
00:24:53,671 --> 00:24:54,797
Scott: Why did he pick the Federal Reserve?

371
00:24:54,817 --> 00:24:57,876
Rym: that thing because it had less security than all the other buildings He was looking after.

372
00:24:57,977 --> 00:24:59,790
Scott: what the fuck buildings was he looking at?

373
00:25:01,452 --> 00:25:03,281
Scott: Is like a picket box of iron?

374
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,010
Scott: yes, it's not a bomb next to it.

375
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:14,710
Scott: So he bought a thousand pounds of bomb It's not gonna do anything even if it worked and kill people on the street and maybe the building across the street.

376
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:18,346
Rym: He recruited a posse of people who might sell FBI agents.

377
00:25:18,648 --> 00:25:21,697
Rym: he He helped them build the bomb with him.

378
00:25:21,998 --> 00:25:30,310
Rym: he finished it he put the detonator in he drove the truck over Parked it went away tried to they don't even let you drive trucks in that neighborhood.

379
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,698
Scott: There's all these barriers and shit.

380
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:40,242
Rym: when the bomb failed to go off He kept trying to do it and he had a plan B And apparently it also constructed a suicide vest again from the fake bomb.

381
00:25:40,262 --> 00:25:42,710
Scott: he was planning to kill himself with the bomb.

382
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,976
Rym: That was his plan B.

383
00:25:44,036 --> 00:25:46,930
Scott: If plan a failed so plan a he was still trying to detonate the bomb.

384
00:25:47,271 --> 00:25:48,074
Scott: How was he gonna get away?

385
00:25:48,094 --> 00:25:50,663
Rym: he was far enough away from the bomb.

386
00:25:50,904 --> 00:25:52,349
Rym: get like a remote detonator, okay?

387
00:25:53,857 --> 00:26:00,244
Rym: So Philosophy aside I think pragmatically this particular dude based on everything.

388
00:26:00,304 --> 00:26:00,826
Rym: I've read.

389
00:26:00,846 --> 00:26:02,932
Rym: It's probably good We're right.

390
00:26:02,973 --> 00:26:12,229
Scott: well if those FBI agents were not there if they just kept my appears that from what I can gather right Approached them Rob, but here's the clip, but that they were making themselves approachable right.

391
00:26:12,269 --> 00:26:16,109
Scott: yeah They put out some sort of front like bombs sets bomb store that he went in.

392
00:26:16,651 --> 00:26:18,738
Rym: This doesn't follow your original analogy.

393
00:26:19,139 --> 00:26:22,910
Rym: those people are perfectly content to live their lives unless the Charles mansion of Manson approaches them.

394
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:27,870
Rym: This is a guy who is susceptible to Manson who is looking for char, right?

395
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:33,950
Scott: But here's the question what if you know the FBI just stood back and kept watching him, and he never actually found anybody?

396
00:26:34,956 --> 00:26:35,950
Scott: He wouldn't have done anything.

397
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:41,910
Rym: Then they have to keep watching him forever because he cuz clearly if he ever found anyone immediate bomb plot.

398
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:45,816
Scott: But if he found someone You know what it was.

399
00:26:45,856 --> 00:26:49,530
Scott: maybe it was worth watching him all those years because now you got two guys.

400
00:26:50,011 --> 00:26:52,541
Scott: Ah, but at the same time that bomb store and bomb by.

401
00:26:52,601 --> 00:26:55,010
Rym: how many people are they watching like this and you know what?

402
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:55,912
Rym: The other nose.

403
00:26:56,174 --> 00:26:59,266
Rym: the other thing I would point out there aren't that many stories like this.

404
00:26:59,306 --> 00:27:02,218
Scott: like we talked about it a lot There's not that many crazy people on earth.

405
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:06,817
Scott: if there were actually a lot of people who wanted to bomb We would already be bombed a lot.

406
00:27:07,218 --> 00:27:14,503
Rym: so because it happens rarely and because this dude Clearly wanted to bomb that thing that is why pragmatically.

407
00:27:14,603 --> 00:27:18,337
Scott: I'm also okay with I'm just a little a Cuz it's a little bit.

408
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:26,750
Rym: I will say I'm leery of This going too far, but I think it's well before the line where I would actually be worried it.

409
00:27:26,831 --> 00:27:28,255
Scott: You know I mean I am leery.

410
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:30,469
Scott: how would you feel right if the police?

411
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:37,230
Scott: Opened up a brothel and if you went to the brothel they just arrested you, but it looked like a brothel.

412
00:27:38,433 --> 00:27:40,265
Rym: So that's where our trappin laws come in.

413
00:27:40,507 --> 00:27:44,161
Rym: yeah Asking someone to do the crime is entrapment.

414
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,550
Rym: if you're there, and they ask you it's not.

415
00:27:47,413 --> 00:27:58,290
Scott: So what if they had this brothel and they just put ads out that were said hey brothel on now No, you can't do that, so how did this guy find the FBI guys if they weren't advertising their bomb shop?

416
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,758
Rym: I didn't read the entire article.

417
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:03,379
Rym: doesn't actually say specifically As alleged complaint country.

418
00:28:03,459 --> 00:28:05,930
Rym: the defendant thought he was striking a blow to the American economy.

419
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:13,510
Scott: How could you even strike even if even if your bomb worked the gold is way underground and your bomb wouldn't hurt the gold.

420
00:28:13,671 --> 00:28:14,920
Scott: And it's oh my god.

421
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,410
Scott: This guy was so dumb already.

422
00:28:17,213 --> 00:28:18,398
Rym: No, he's smart in one regard.

423
00:28:18,538 --> 00:28:21,610
Rym: any bomb attack anywhere would put America into a shitstorm.

424
00:28:21,771 --> 00:28:22,856
Scott: It would cause a shitstorm.

425
00:28:22,876 --> 00:28:25,449
Scott: Yeah, but it wouldn't do anything to the Federal Reserve, or I don't?

426
00:28:26,952 --> 00:28:31,350
Rym: He clearly didn't knew that but knew that a terror attack on anything would have the same effect.

427
00:28:31,591 --> 00:28:34,064
Scott: Then why was he going after something with low security?

428
00:28:34,164 --> 00:28:37,259
Scott: because low security means Low security.

429
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:41,856
Scott: that does go for like someone's house compared to Town hall in some town.

430
00:28:41,876 --> 00:28:45,349
Rym: so Scott when I was a kid a house blew up there my name in my neighborhood straight up.

431
00:28:46,192 --> 00:28:47,778
Rym: So yes, yeah, ghastly.

432
00:28:47,818 --> 00:28:50,710
Rym: No one was home, so it was not a terrorist anyway.

433
00:28:57,702 --> 00:28:59,662
Rym: but anyway things of the day.

434
00:29:04,385 --> 00:29:13,230
Scott: In our crew there are Games at which they are experts and better than everyone else at for example Scott is probably the best Mega Man 2 player in the entire crew.

435
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,274
Rym: He's really good at.

436
00:29:14,495 --> 00:29:23,415
Scott: he's one of these a world-class pac-man xd xd x player CED and but yeah one of the games that I'm better at than everyone that I know is dr.

437
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:23,716
Scott: Mario.

438
00:29:26,321 --> 00:29:29,593
Scott: Some reason I can't play penalty pawn for shit, but I'm really good at dr.

439
00:29:29,633 --> 00:29:32,486
Scott: Mario at least compared to other people I know with all qualifications.

440
00:29:32,506 --> 00:29:33,452
Rym: I'm pretty good at dr.

441
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:33,874
Rym: Mario.

442
00:29:33,995 --> 00:29:37,466
Rym: Well you cannot bad In a world without Scott.

443
00:29:37,787 --> 00:29:38,630
Rym: I'm really good at dr.

444
00:29:38,671 --> 00:29:39,032
Rym: Mario.

445
00:29:39,052 --> 00:29:41,200
Rym: Scott beats the ever-living fuck out of me.

446
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,020
Scott: I don't know how come you people can't play this game.

447
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:50,587
Rym: It's not hard cuz I'll play against like one of our other friends and the gulf between me and them is The same as the gulf between me and Scott.

448
00:29:50,607 --> 00:29:51,430
Scott: like what are you doing?

449
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:53,579
Scott: It's like you fucking this three colors of pill.

450
00:29:54,121 --> 00:29:55,166
Rym: It's got hard.

451
00:29:55,247 --> 00:29:55,568
Rym: so Scott.

452
00:29:55,588 --> 00:29:57,197
Rym: Let's turn this around advanced wars.

453
00:29:57,217 --> 00:29:57,820
Rym: What are you doing?

454
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,318
Scott: Just move the inventory out of the city more complex than dr.

455
00:30:01,338 --> 00:30:01,720
Scott: Mario.

456
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,873
Scott: So here's a video, I think it's computer-assisted it has to.

457
00:30:06,893 --> 00:30:14,651
Scott: there's no way a human being could do this on purpose and No human could stack books like this right.

458
00:30:15,214 --> 00:30:16,639
Scott: and it's a video of a guy playing dr.

459
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,674
Scott: Mario in the NES or a computer playing dr.

460
00:30:18,694 --> 00:30:22,920
Scott: Mario in the NES and Basically almost filling the entire pill bottle.

461
00:30:23,141 --> 00:30:30,620
Scott: I think he's like three spaces away from filling it and then setting off a combo that clears the entire pill bottle.

462
00:30:31,482 --> 00:30:36,035
Rym: All I could think watching it the entire time was battle balls.

463
00:30:36,095 --> 00:30:41,580
Scott: Yep, but the real thing I have The problem I have with this video is that you look at the score.

464
00:30:42,503 --> 00:30:46,920
Scott: When he starts setting up the combo the score is 600 and when it ends the score is 1500.

465
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:55,210
Scott: He only got 900 points for the best possible move you could make because the game does not reward combos except in multiplayer Where the game I first.

466
00:30:55,372 --> 00:30:58,669
Scott: I think the game only Rewards you with points for killing the viruses.

467
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:02,565
Scott: and he did it in level one where they're only like a handful of viruses in There right?

468
00:31:02,585 --> 00:31:02,967
Scott: All right.

469
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:04,496
Scott: I think he just did it like there.

470
00:31:04,536 --> 00:31:07,993
Scott: Yeah level zero They're only like three viruses in the pill bottle or something.

471
00:31:08,395 --> 00:31:12,548
Rym: when he said no How come there isn't a DS 3ds game?

472
00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:14,714
Rym: That's like the Tetris but is also dr.

473
00:31:14,734 --> 00:31:15,155
Rym: Mario.

474
00:31:15,236 --> 00:31:15,396
Scott: It's 3d.

475
00:31:15,436 --> 00:31:15,476
Scott: Dr.

476
00:31:15,516 --> 00:31:18,405
Rym: Mario That might be terrible.

477
00:31:18,707 --> 00:31:19,188
Scott: three.

478
00:31:19,469 --> 00:31:21,316
Rym: Remember welteris 3d?

479
00:31:21,456 --> 00:31:22,580
Rym: things like that are never good.

480
00:31:22,901 --> 00:31:24,788
Scott: Rotate the pill bottle and get the nails in there.

481
00:31:24,848 --> 00:31:28,040
Rym: That would be a terrible game that you would hate and never play.

482
00:31:29,102 --> 00:31:32,504
Scott: The pills get like a plus shaped pill But it's a 3d plus.

483
00:31:32,564 --> 00:31:36,557
Scott: that's got two pieces going through the middle and your l-shaped ones.

484
00:31:36,577 --> 00:31:37,802
Scott: You got to spin them around Okay.

485
00:31:37,902 --> 00:31:38,847
Rym: Yeah, it sounds pretty horrible.

486
00:31:38,887 --> 00:31:39,309
Scott: That's bad.

487
00:31:39,349 --> 00:31:41,520
Scott: But this is pretty epic to watch.

488
00:31:42,062 --> 00:31:44,373
Scott: It'd be like if someone is playing Tetris in a long piece.

489
00:31:44,393 --> 00:31:46,298
Scott: That was as long as the whole Tetris Boom.

490
00:31:48,709 --> 00:31:55,587
Rym: So Alright, I guess I should do my thing of the day - yeah, you should.

491
00:31:56,290 --> 00:32:03,687
Rym: so probably my favorite thing in the Simpsons is groundskeeper Willie and This is a small compilation.

492
00:32:03,747 --> 00:32:07,820
Rym: It's not really the best of groundskeeper Willie because he has some other really good moments.

493
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,305
Rym: How long is this video pretty short?

494
00:32:09,365 --> 00:32:13,077
Rym: Actually, it's not like a minute and a half one minute.

495
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:13,860
Scott: That's Willie's time.

496
00:32:15,607 --> 00:32:19,729
Rym: It's not every Willie It's not all the best Willie but it is.

497
00:32:19,749 --> 00:32:24,469
Rym: it is a. It covers the full breadth of Willie.

498
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:28,119
Rym: Rym is a connoisseur of Willie and I gotta say I get a lot.

499
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,004
Scott: They're really being penises.

500
00:32:30,084 --> 00:32:35,560
Rym: The reason I like Gravity Falls is that the background characters feel very Simpsons esque.

501
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:38,327
Rym: Okay, they're being used the same way.

502
00:32:38,347 --> 00:32:42,780
Rym: I feel like this family is related like you're really - Willie's family.

503
00:32:44,501 --> 00:32:46,129
Scott: Anyway, Willie jokes insert here.

504
00:32:46,149 --> 00:32:48,300
Scott: All right, that's all your thing today.

505
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:48,782
Rym: That's my thing.

506
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:53,985
Scott: is that a moment time book club book is the name of the wind by Rock fuss.

507
00:32:54,246 --> 00:32:55,891
Rym: I'm 17% of the way through it.

508
00:32:55,911 --> 00:32:56,815
Scott: I have finished reading it.

509
00:32:56,835 --> 00:32:58,200
Rym: It's pretty good.

510
00:32:59,121 --> 00:33:01,550
Rym: It's a young adult novel as far as I'm concerned.

511
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,196
Rym: very light reading read it.

512
00:33:03,497 --> 00:33:04,180
Scott: It's book club book.

513
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:04,902
Scott: He's so far.

514
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:09,457
Rym: I like it, but the main character a little bit of Mary Sue just saying well, what fantasy book?

515
00:33:09,577 --> 00:33:10,380
Scott: it's fantasy book.

516
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,571
Rym: It's not a the Prince of Nothing at no point.

517
00:33:13,611 --> 00:33:14,454
Rym: Do I think man?

518
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:22,299
Scott: I really want to be so-and-so I really want to be Alright not our acts.

519
00:33:23,242 --> 00:33:24,730
Rym: Anyway, what about cell?

520
00:33:24,771 --> 00:33:26,360
Rym: you want to be cell whatever?

521
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:35,618
Rym: I'd like to be the dragon father, you know, he's not bad to be The priest guy.

522
00:33:37,427 --> 00:33:38,959
Rym: You don't remember any of their names do you?

523
00:33:41,341 --> 00:33:46,215
Scott: You mean the holy Shreya, yeah my thinet that's right news M you're not bad being him.

524
00:33:46,476 --> 00:33:49,138
Scott: Yeah things don't go well for him though I'm just saying it's not the worst job.

525
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,730
Rym: Okay, so I'd rather be confidence.

526
00:33:53,132 --> 00:33:58,653
Rym: any other meta moments We got so not this weekend, but next weekend.

527
00:33:58,914 --> 00:34:00,700
Scott: burning con burning con.

528
00:34:00,901 --> 00:34:02,251
Scott: It's too late to join burning con.

529
00:34:02,271 --> 00:34:09,059
Rym: if you're not already in on it It's gonna be a pretty great time But if you're not already in on it, then there's nothing I can say to you.

530
00:34:09,541 --> 00:34:16,500
Rym: But if you were a gamer of any stripe in the role-playing variety Lou Crane has posted some helpful hints for how to run a scenario.

531
00:34:17,581 --> 00:34:20,040
Rym: These are not applicable just to burning con.

532
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:27,677
Scott: These should be your Bible any our commandment for any RPG any one-shot RPG at any con should follow these Commandments.

541
00:34:55,342 --> 00:34:56,585
Scott: Yeah, come on.

542
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,372
Rym: so when I was a really little kid.

543
00:34:58,954 --> 00:35:05,659
Rym: I went to a haunted house at local high school and I remember very distinctly that it was this big maze.

544
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:10,492
Rym: and when you first go up to it there are two doors that you pick one and me and my dad went.

545
00:35:11,095 --> 00:35:13,803
Rym: one was terror and One was death.

546
00:35:14,425 --> 00:35:14,626
Scott: Mm-hmm.

547
00:35:14,927 --> 00:35:21,428
Rym: I think they both led to the same place, but I wasn't sure Because they did not immediately lead to the same place.

548
00:35:21,588 --> 00:35:26,874
Rym: No, and I chose terror and immediately regretted it and to this day I wonder what was behind.

549
00:35:26,914 --> 00:35:33,958
Rym: death Should have gone back in for a second try and this was actually one of the best haunted houses I ever did in my entire life.

550
00:35:35,202 --> 00:35:35,544
Rym: You know why.

551
00:35:35,584 --> 00:35:36,167
Rym: you know what it was?

552
00:35:36,649 --> 00:35:52,963
Rym: It was just a maze Filling an entire high school gym of just black walls and a black ceiling very dimly lit and it was just amazed and there were sounds and stuff going on around and the lighting was kind of different in all these different places.

553
00:35:52,983 --> 00:35:57,063
Rym: it was a difficult and long maze and They're all.

554
00:35:57,103 --> 00:36:01,344
Rym: you always hear someone like following you and you'd see their shadow But they'd never.

555
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:03,880
Scott: and no didn't you run into other people who are normal people?

556
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:16,647
Rym: No, they sent you in one tiny group at a time And you never actually see any other person in the maze But you'd hear them and you'd like see them like just around the corner like they'd be someone there But there'd be no one there.

557
00:36:16,688 --> 00:36:18,055
Rym: when you got there you never act.

558
00:36:18,317 --> 00:36:28,640
Rym: at no point Did anyone go boo and I got to tell you about three quarters away through I was so ready For someone to yell boo that that was actually making me nervous.

559
00:36:29,902 --> 00:36:33,060
Rym: That was the best haunted house ever went to and nothing else has ever even come close.

560
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,228
Scott: That is definitely better than a lot of haunted houses.

561
00:36:35,248 --> 00:36:38,620
Scott: I have seen and heard in my life, but it is not amazing.

562
00:36:39,082 --> 00:36:41,452
Rym: Yeah, well it is amazing compared to most haunted houses.

563
00:36:41,573 --> 00:36:46,697
Scott: That is true because most haunted houses are shit They're awful and it's usually just walk through a place.

564
00:36:46,758 --> 00:37:10,345
Scott: It's dark there's a bunch of stuff with like neon lights and you know ultraviolet blacklight action and Then there's like a you know skeletons and vampires and then there's a few people who work there that jump out and go boo you know and stuff like that and stuff that pops out of the walls and goes boo and Things that you can't see but they feel real nasty like spaghetti, but it feels like you know worms all that kind of nonsense.

565
00:37:10,405 --> 00:37:15,803
Scott: and then you know, maybe wacky mirrors and other things to surprise you and That's it.

566
00:37:16,505 --> 00:37:17,027
Scott: Then you get out.

567
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:19,836
Rym: So I remember once when I was a little older.

568
00:37:19,856 --> 00:37:23,220
Rym: I was in like middle school I think maybe a late elementary school.

569
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:29,760
Rym: I went to Florida with my family and we heard there was this really awesome haunted house called like the terror on Church Street.

570
00:37:30,721 --> 00:37:31,886
Rym: So it was expensive.

571
00:37:31,946 --> 00:37:35,180
Rym: So we went to it and it wasn't really that scary.

572
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:46,820
Rym: But the people with me flip the fuck out because the production values were extremely high and the actors were really good Expensive it better be and the sets were amazing, but it's still just the same as all the other.

573
00:37:47,001 --> 00:37:47,846
Rym: Yeah, but it was more.

574
00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:52,650
Rym: while it wasn't going to scare me It was very well done.

575
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:55,020
Scott: It was almost I mean, that's like the Disney haunted house, right?

576
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,683
Scott: The Haunted Mansion.

577
00:37:55,703 --> 00:37:58,900
Scott: you go in there and it's like you're not scared of anything in the fucking Haunted Mansion.

578
00:37:59,023 --> 00:37:59,639
Rym: But oh, you know what?

579
00:38:01,701 --> 00:38:04,033
Scott: There's so many effects in there and all these.

580
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:04,978
Scott: it's like a work of art.

581
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:06,023
Scott: almost It's like you're walking.

582
00:38:06,043 --> 00:38:08,913
Scott: you're going through this living painting that has a haunted theme to it.

583
00:38:09,034 --> 00:38:09,756
Scott: You will be.

584
00:38:09,877 --> 00:38:13,796
Scott: it's so awesome You want to do it like four or five times just to see all the stuff they got.

585
00:38:13,816 --> 00:38:21,328
Rym: when I was a little kid I was riding that with my brother and I started telling him that a kid died in there because the ride broke and it crushed Him and that you could still see the bloodstains.

586
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:23,174
Rym: and I think I scared him.

587
00:38:23,656 --> 00:38:24,960
Scott: Your brother is scared of skeletons.

588
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,291
Rym: Skeletons are scary as fuck if you're like four.

589
00:38:28,351 --> 00:38:29,436
Scott: No, I like skeletons.

590
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:30,764
Rym: even when you were four I was never.

591
00:38:30,784 --> 00:38:32,920
Scott: I was scared of things obviously when I was small, right?

592
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,329
Scott: Just like everyone is but I was not scared of skeletons.

593
00:38:35,871 --> 00:38:38,280
Rym: So there is something to be afraid of in the Disney haunted house.

594
00:38:38,561 --> 00:38:44,100
Rym: Mm-hmm when I the first time I ever wrote it I was actually sitting with my grandma was his California, Florida, Florida.

595
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:48,180
Scott: I've also never been to Disneyland also only been to the Florida one and not the California.

596
00:38:49,084 --> 00:38:50,511
Rym: I was like, we're going to Disneyland.

597
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:52,300
Rym: I'm almost like no you're going to Disney World.

598
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,325
Rym: I was like, what's the difference?

599
00:38:53,405 --> 00:38:56,480
Rym: She was like one of them's tiny and the other one is gigantic and awesome.

600
00:38:56,723 --> 00:38:59,624
Rym: Yeah, I was like, okay, we're going California.

601
00:38:59,724 --> 00:39:01,977
Scott: one is is while it's tiny is more historic.

602
00:39:02,098 --> 00:39:11,688
Rym: Yeah anyway, so we were in it and you know that point where there's like these ghouls that go like They come out at you like a blah right in your face.

603
00:39:11,708 --> 00:39:13,313
Rym: Yeah, the ride broke down.

604
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:19,119
Rym: Okay, right in front of that thing For like a half hour you're stuck in there for a half hour.

605
00:39:19,361 --> 00:39:20,612
Rym: I was stuck in there for a half.

606
00:39:20,632 --> 00:39:21,460
Scott: you're in there that long.

607
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,131
Scott: they'll just say get off and use the emergency.

608
00:39:23,151 --> 00:39:26,765
Rym: know that we just sat there and It kept starting up again.

609
00:39:26,905 --> 00:39:29,374
Rym: So every couple of minutes this ghoul would go in our faces.

610
00:39:29,434 --> 00:39:32,124
Scott: Oh So the crack.

611
00:39:32,486 --> 00:39:35,680
Scott: the cars weren't moving but the all the other effects are still running.

612
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:42,899
Rym: Yes, maybe because the effects were running they wouldn't let us get on walk But the ghoul kept jumping out for like a half hour.

613
00:39:43,961 --> 00:39:46,916
Scott: That's not scary that's just that's scary.

614
00:39:46,996 --> 00:39:47,760
Scott: but it is scary.

615
00:39:49,201 --> 00:40:01,247
Rym: It's scary in the same way that I'm moderately afraid of entering a subway car filled with hobo Not existential horror but practical horror exactly Like that guy might actually stab me.

616
00:40:01,267 --> 00:40:06,160
Scott: a half hour of my life wasted and listening to horrible repeated noise and I can't escape.

617
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,848
Rym: So Scott, how do we make haunted houses that would scare us?

618
00:40:09,249 --> 00:40:20,600
Scott: to scare us is incredibly difficult to make a haunted house to scare someone like us right because what you need to do is You need to because you know, we're so smart not that we're geniuses, right?

619
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,452
Scott: But we're smart enough to know there's no such thing as actual ghosts.

620
00:40:23,714 --> 00:40:25,100
Scott: There's other things actual monsters.

621
00:40:25,442 --> 00:40:29,020
Scott: We know that no one in the haunted house is actually gonna hurt us, right?

622
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:34,820
Scott: We are no in no real danger at any at any time, you know things like, you know, you know what?

623
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,445
Rym: I enjoy the.

624
00:40:36,727 --> 00:40:44,000
Rym: the roller coaster is still enjoyable because the Sensations of zero-g and flipping upside down are pleasurable in and of themselves.

625
00:40:44,084 --> 00:40:55,380
Rym: Yes but most people I know scream on the roller coaster and actually get scared and my hobby in middle school was to Being like be doing something weird and nonchalant when the picture was taken.

626
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,380
Scott: Yeah, you should get a cup of tea and a mustache.

627
00:40:59,382 --> 00:41:04,120
Rym: Once we had I had a piece of cardboard and I had newspaper taped around him.

628
00:41:04,542 --> 00:41:06,699
Rym: So I unfold this big newspaper just reading it.

629
00:41:08,302 --> 00:41:08,564
Rym: One of them.

630
00:41:08,585 --> 00:41:10,539
Rym: I took my seatbelt off and stood up one of them.

631
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:13,211
Scott: I'm not doing that except listen to the kiddie coaster.

632
00:41:13,291 --> 00:41:15,560
Rym: that anyway, it was on the Magnum XL 200.

633
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:20,619
Scott: So here's here's you know I've tried to think of like what would it take to make a haunted house?

634
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,729
Scott: That could actually scare someone like me and I could.

635
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:28,499
Scott: I came up with the parameters and then I came up with only one Example that met the parameters, right?

636
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,314
Scott: Alright, so the parameters are you really have to?

637
00:41:32,414 --> 00:41:33,860
Scott: you know, you have to go farther.

638
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:38,840
Scott: Obviously the normal haunted house are gonna go perhaps beyond legality beyond waver area.

639
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,168
Rym: Well, there is that haunted house.

640
00:41:40,188 --> 00:41:42,060
Rym: You have to sign a waiver for in New York City.

641
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,658
Scott: Okay, well that I heard about that and I heard about that too.

642
00:41:44,678 --> 00:41:49,048
Rym: So I read They sexually assault you and waterboard you.

643
00:41:49,068 --> 00:41:52,860
Scott: Yeah, like all I knew about it originally was hey, there's a haunted house.

644
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:56,800
Scott: It's supposed to be actually like crazy adult sign a waiver pay a lot of money.

645
00:41:57,041 --> 00:41:59,290
Scott: That's all I knew about it and knowing only those facts.

646
00:41:59,350 --> 00:41:59,832
Scott: I thought huh?

647
00:42:00,113 --> 00:42:01,819
Scott: Maybe that's good, but I'm not paying for it.

648
00:42:02,285 --> 00:42:10,384
Scott: And then I heard later Oh, they actually just hurt you and it's like well if they actually hurt you that sort of Right.

649
00:42:10,424 --> 00:42:13,093
Rym: It was if it was if the weird sexual stuff wasn't there.

650
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:19,320
Scott: cuz it feels reading that yes I want you to literally waterboard me so that I feel like I am suffocating.

651
00:42:19,421 --> 00:42:22,400
Scott: Yeah, I'll be fucking scared that you're gonna fuck up and I'm gonna die.

652
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,164
Rym: You know what though?

653
00:42:23,567 --> 00:42:24,452
Rym: imagine if it were that.

654
00:42:24,472 --> 00:42:25,860
Rym: but it wasn't themed as a haunted house.

655
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,600
Rym: It was themed as like a James Bond adventure.

656
00:42:29,063 --> 00:42:31,960
Rym: But for real where you have to like fight dudes off and I get a pain.

657
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:34,411
Scott: Yeah, but I don't want anyone to actually hurt me.

658
00:42:34,913 --> 00:42:36,340
Scott: Why would I want to actually be hurt?

659
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,385
Rym: Well, it doesn't physically hurt you.

660
00:42:38,425 --> 00:42:39,267
Rym: It's just terrifying.

661
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:41,915
Scott: Uh, if somebody's fucking suffocating you.

662
00:42:41,935 --> 00:42:43,480
Scott: Yeah or whipping you.

663
00:42:43,681 --> 00:42:46,280
Rym: That would be an interesting experience.

664
00:42:46,902 --> 00:42:47,846
Scott: You can sign up for that.

665
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:48,267
Rym: I would.

666
00:42:48,327 --> 00:42:55,013
Rym: it's like Penn Jillette when he said well famously that yeah if you're into that They have those no, but he said famously that when he finally does die.

667
00:42:55,254 --> 00:43:00,072
Rym: He wants to die in lingering Excruciating pain because he's a large dungeon in this house.

668
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:05,735
Rym: He'd at least like to know what that feels like but then he qualified it by saying but not anytime soon.

669
00:43:05,775 --> 00:43:07,681
Scott: you fucking sickos Yeah I'm gonna.

670
00:43:07,962 --> 00:43:10,612
Scott: I'm planned to go out doing all kinds of drugs to know what they feel like.

671
00:43:10,633 --> 00:43:14,107
Scott: cuz the side effects and permanent harm of The drugs won't matter if I'm gonna die soon.

672
00:43:14,147 --> 00:43:17,080
Rym: I read that article about how bath salts basically cause permanent brain damage.

673
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,305
Scott: Yeah, you don't want bath salts.

674
00:43:18,546 --> 00:43:19,350
Scott: Let's not talk about that.

675
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:20,656
Scott: So what would it say?

676
00:43:20,676 --> 00:43:21,580
Rym: Wait, there's a haunted house.

677
00:43:21,801 --> 00:43:24,170
Rym: You drug people with LSD on the way in sure.

678
00:43:24,612 --> 00:43:26,620
Scott: Here's how you actually make the haunted house.

679
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,743
Scott: Here's the parameters right?

680
00:43:28,004 --> 00:43:30,452
Scott: What you need to do is you need to make it.

681
00:43:30,652 --> 00:43:33,545
Scott: you can't fool anyone with special effects like us Right.

682
00:43:33,667 --> 00:43:35,564
Scott: It has to be Actual.

683
00:43:35,685 --> 00:43:46,491
Scott: I would argue there could be special effects that could fool me But you wouldn't actually believe that they were actually like a monster or that you you need to believe monster No, but like knife trap.

684
00:43:46,552 --> 00:43:48,220
Rym: that is so realistic, right?

685
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:52,271
Scott: You need to somehow penetrate your suspension of disbelief, right?

686
00:43:52,291 --> 00:43:53,715
Scott: Which is incredibly difficult, right?

687
00:43:53,755 --> 00:43:57,206
Scott: Because at first you're gonna think yeah Okay fake skeleton right.

688
00:43:57,447 --> 00:44:01,304
Scott: then the skeletons coming after you and you're like, yeah that skeletons not actually gonna hurt me It's a haunted.

689
00:44:01,324 --> 00:44:02,071
Scott: It's a haunted house.

690
00:44:02,192 --> 00:44:03,060
Scott: That's a pretty cool skeleton.

691
00:44:03,442 --> 00:44:04,566
Scott: I admire your handiwork.

692
00:44:04,586 --> 00:44:09,247
Scott: then it kills your dad cuz he's in on it, right and you're like, yeah, okay I know my dad's in on it.

693
00:44:09,347 --> 00:44:10,774
Scott: Yeah, my dad's not actually dead.

694
00:44:10,854 --> 00:44:11,076
Scott: Sure.

695
00:44:11,116 --> 00:44:11,618
Scott: Whatever right?

696
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:17,158
Scott: It needs to actually, you know, it's getting close to you and you're like, yeah It's not gonna actually hurt me.

697
00:44:17,501 --> 00:44:22,726
Scott: It needs to get so close to actually hurting you that it Doesn't smash you.

698
00:44:22,847 --> 00:44:25,720
Scott: obviously cuz I don't actually hurt anyone like that stupid haunted house.

699
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:33,277
Scott: But it needs to get so close to hurting you that it just doesn't hurt you But hurts your suspension of disbelief and shatters.

700
00:44:33,377 --> 00:44:38,354
Scott: Oh Scott And at that moment, you will actually be fearing for your life or tearing for your body.

701
00:44:38,816 --> 00:44:40,020
Rym: did that for a moment?

702
00:44:40,923 --> 00:44:42,300
Rym: It had this one of the early areas.

703
00:44:42,300 --> 00:45:00,620
Rym: There's like this graveyard and an iron like fence blocking it off like a really tall fence And there's this guy with the shovel kind of shambling around over there and there's a gates there's a fence You're like looking at him and walking by and it's kind of like a zoo and and he kind of shambles over to the fence And then he just like fucking tears it open and there's more.

704
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:06,120
Rym: It's kind of like a boo but like you thought he couldn't be near you and then suddenly the the parameters changed.

705
00:45:06,361 --> 00:45:07,807
Rym: Yep, changing the parameters.

706
00:45:07,848 --> 00:45:09,595
Rym: I think is a good way to start the suspension.

707
00:45:09,615 --> 00:45:09,877
Rym: Yeah.

708
00:45:09,917 --> 00:45:12,528
Scott: Well, I think so Here's the thing you can't use it's not?

709
00:45:12,568 --> 00:45:16,265
Scott: you can't jump out and go boo because that's startling or surprised It's not fear.

710
00:45:16,286 --> 00:45:18,265
Rym: So he just follows us for a while with this shovel Yeah.

711
00:45:19,103 --> 00:45:33,300
Rym: and then eventually he's like he's really close to us and he's standing like Literally, like we like a centimeter or two behind my mom like right there like right next to her Yeah, and he's holding this shovel like whatever and then he looks at her and he raises the shovel.

712
00:45:33,709 --> 00:45:42,211
Rym: It's like yeah He's not gonna hear with the show and then he swings it at her way hard and it ended up being a boffer shovel But it but because he'd been beating it against something before.

713
00:45:42,231 --> 00:45:45,344
Rym: I think there was a piece of metal in it that he then like Palmed later.

714
00:45:45,886 --> 00:45:48,580
Rym: It looked like it was a real shovel that he was beating against metal.

715
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:52,540
Rym: And then he hit my mother with the same shovel and it did not it.

716
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:57,020
Rym: There was no point where I realized that he had swapped it out or done something different.

717
00:45:57,981 --> 00:45:58,946
Scott: Yeah, that's not bad.

718
00:45:59,086 --> 00:46:02,020
Scott: There was a momentary suspension of disbelief not bad.

719
00:46:02,241 --> 00:46:04,669
Scott: So that's getting close to what I'm thinking right?

720
00:46:04,729 --> 00:46:07,218
Scott: So or maybe that is even on target.

721
00:46:07,238 --> 00:46:10,980
Scott: So You can't do startling and surprise.

722
00:46:11,402 --> 00:46:13,994
Scott: You also can't do oh my god, so gross cuz.

723
00:46:14,014 --> 00:46:15,340
Scott: that doesn't work on everybody, right?

724
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,489
Scott: There's only some Pete and it's like it's weird cuz like for me.

725
00:46:18,951 --> 00:46:25,131
Scott: if I see real gore like some like a surgery on TV I'm gonna bargo right and that would I guess that does account.

726
00:46:25,392 --> 00:46:27,359
Scott: it's more nauseous than scared, right?

727
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:29,327
Scott: So what do you think?

728
00:46:29,407 --> 00:46:30,737
Rym: or because there was a situation?

729
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:39,460
Scott: I watch movies that I know are not real movies But the gore is realistic or even better than realistic and has no effect on me whatsoever.

730
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:48,059
Scott: So if I know that I'm in the haunted house, there's no gore that could actually get me And in fact, maybe I don't know about this.

731
00:46:48,461 --> 00:46:56,178
Scott: But maybe if you like what if someone actually like spilled their intestines out for reals while I was in a haunted house Would I be grossed out?

732
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,764
Scott: Cuz it's real gore.

733
00:46:59,126 --> 00:47:03,060
Scott: and maybe a psycho murderer broke into the haunted house and thought he could get away with psycho murders in there.

734
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,800
Scott: So Scott there, I don't know what would happen.

735
00:47:05,342 --> 00:47:09,015
Rym: There are multiple stories that are true and I've got pictures of them right here.

736
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:10,220
Rym: this mummy and haunted house.

737
00:47:10,481 --> 00:47:11,425
Rym: It was a real dead guy.

738
00:47:11,546 --> 00:47:11,847
Scott: Okay.

739
00:47:12,249 --> 00:47:14,439
Rym: No one knew they just had this body that was hanging.

740
00:47:14,459 --> 00:47:17,667
Rym: and the story is this is this is like for real.

741
00:47:17,687 --> 00:47:23,609
Rym: some kids were basically in this haunted house one day and they're dicking around and They like hit it and I broke open.

742
00:47:23,649 --> 00:47:26,160
Rym: there was a bone in there and it was a real body.

743
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:27,507
Rym: It was this guy who was killed.

744
00:47:27,527 --> 00:47:32,687
Rym: Okay, so it was real gore But nobody freaked out because of it.

745
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:39,178
Rym: it appears that the people who discover that it was a real body did in fact freak out Right, but the people who just saw it in the haunted house did never.

746
00:47:39,198 --> 00:47:43,040
Rym: yeah So what if the haunted house was set up for something looks like a cheesy decoration?

747
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:50,180
Rym: But then like it breaks and there it looks really realistically like there was a real body in there like someone fucked up.

748
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,716
Scott: I wouldn't believe it like, you know, it's really a replica.

749
00:47:53,757 --> 00:47:54,480
Rym: Here's another one.

750
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:57,416
Rym: This is a real dead dude, but everyone thought it was a Halloween decoration.

751
00:47:57,436 --> 00:48:00,084
Rym: Okay So it can't happen.

752
00:48:00,165 --> 00:48:04,399
Scott: it would be very hard for me to actually start believing that it was an actual, you know.

753
00:48:05,261 --> 00:48:16,900
Scott: Anyway, because it's like, you know, like anyway, whatever like how it would had to be basically So perfect and I would have to investigate it for so long before I believed it was actually a dead person.

754
00:48:17,321 --> 00:48:22,220
Scott: Right, because even if the staff came in and were like, oh shit, I'd be like, yeah, they're faking it, right?

755
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:28,269
Scott: It's like you would need like the real police to come and you know You need so much for me to suspend the disbelief.

756
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:31,540
Scott: by then I wouldn't even be near the body anymore to freak out.

757
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:34,049
Scott: So here's the here's the haunted house thing.

758
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:35,134
Scott: I came up with right?

759
00:48:35,274 --> 00:48:35,535
Rym: All right.

760
00:48:35,555 --> 00:48:36,780
Rym: I still like my LSD idea.

761
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:39,858
Scott: That's not a bad idea, but it's also sort of cheating but it's not bad.

762
00:48:40,822 --> 00:48:45,540
Scott: Plus you don't know if that'll scare everybody but if you accompany it with this the imagery of hauntedness it probably work.

763
00:48:46,064 --> 00:48:47,354
Scott: so here's the idea I came up with.

764
00:48:47,395 --> 00:48:51,149
Scott: that would be Possibly and it's close to your shovel example, right?

765
00:48:51,169 --> 00:48:53,780
Scott: All right, you go into a narrow hallway, right?

766
00:48:54,362 --> 00:48:59,660
Scott: And obviously for safety reasons there is an escape but it is hidden so no one knows about it and it's like.

767
00:48:59,741 --> 00:49:01,579
Scott: You know, you just want to make the fire marshal happy, right?

768
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,170
Scott: But no one can see it and it's so hard to see.

769
00:49:04,211 --> 00:49:07,366
Scott: but it could be open from the outside by the workers Right, so it's it totally safe.

770
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:09,656
Scott: and then you go down the narrow hallway.

771
00:49:09,676 --> 00:49:10,480
Scott: So you're all single file.

772
00:49:11,881 --> 00:49:19,269
Scott: Then you're cramped in like he and it's all decorated haunted like and you get to the end of the hallway into the door And it's fucking locked and you really can't open it.

773
00:49:20,112 --> 00:49:20,955
Scott: So you go dirt bitter.

774
00:49:21,015 --> 00:49:23,488
Scott: It's gonna open we know okay Maybe this is secret.

775
00:49:23,649 --> 00:49:35,037
Scott: Whatever you try to go back Yeah, we lock the door behind you also and you're actually locked in except for the fire exit that you know, so You're in there for a while, right and you're like what the fuck.

776
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:38,699
Rym: so This terror on Church Street another scene that happened, right?

777
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:47,800
Rym: you eventually come into this room that has like a fireplace with what looks like a real fire going and There's these figures all sitting around the table shrouded black that just don't move.

778
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:54,360
Rym: They look like statues or people but you can't tell yeah, and then the door closes locks behind you and nothing happens.

779
00:49:54,643 --> 00:49:59,980
Scott: Yeah for many minutes You got to have someone watching the people in there because there's gonna be the difference.

780
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:00,743
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

781
00:50:00,764 --> 00:50:04,200
Rym: The reality is all the people sitting around the table weren't dummies?

782
00:50:04,824 --> 00:50:06,599
Rym: Of course not but they still didn't move at all.

783
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:10,400
Rym: Good job, so we're sitting there and we're sitting there and we're sitting there and we're sitting there and I would have investigated them.

784
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:21,816
Rym: Though yeah, we did so we started investigating and once we finally someone goes over to the table and as soon as they get really close one of like They all stand up and turn and they all simultaneously point toward this for toward the fireplace.

785
00:50:21,976 --> 00:50:27,776
Scott: Yeah, I'd be like, yeah Okay, I know that you're all people So I that wouldn't work.

786
00:50:27,856 --> 00:50:28,380
Rym: so continue.

787
00:50:28,661 --> 00:50:31,229
Scott: so you're trapped in this thing and everyone's watching.

788
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:37,632
Scott: right that the staff are watching to make to follow you through the stages of Horror of being locked in for reals, right or mostly for reals.

789
00:50:37,692 --> 00:50:39,820
Scott: as far as you can't get out you look for secret exits.

790
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:43,877
Scott: You have to make it like I would almost you try to bash down the doors on either end.

791
00:50:43,917 --> 00:50:50,016
Scott: They don't open Go out and you know this or there's barely any lighting and you just actually can't get out.

792
00:50:50,317 --> 00:50:56,594
Rym: I would do yours Like the power had gone out and like the employees were gone or something too.

793
00:50:56,795 --> 00:50:58,420
Scott: Yeah, cuz then you know that that's bullshit.

794
00:50:58,581 --> 00:50:59,652
Rym: Not necessarily.

795
00:50:59,672 --> 00:51:00,459
Scott: Well, you know this bullshit.

796
00:51:00,902 --> 00:51:09,587
Scott: I would I would assume a right away that that was bullshit and you had to leave me locked in there for quite a while before like the point where you're actually worried right.

797
00:51:09,628 --> 00:51:15,002
Scott: and then what you do is you come in with the Spikes.

798
00:51:15,203 --> 00:51:18,796
Scott: this, you know, these ceiling opens up and spikes come down right and it's like, okay.

799
00:51:18,816 --> 00:51:22,632
Scott: Yeah, haha Those are gonna stop before they actually hurt anybody right?

800
00:51:22,752 --> 00:51:29,860
Scott: Everyone knows that you're not gonna actually, you know Impale me on a spike ceiling that's coming down like freakin trash compactor in Star Wars, right?

801
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:34,060
Scott: Or you can even do the walls squishing in also and it's like yeah, those are gonna stop, right?

802
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:52,931
Scott: You know, we'll just stand here in the middle and then whatever right but then they keep coming and they keep coming and it's like It's like, okay, they're gonna stop real soon but now you're like forced to actually lie on the ground because they're gonna keep coming and It's like oh Jesus Christ They're really letting these things go farther than they will.

803
00:51:53,051 --> 00:51:57,952
Scott: and then like they're actually sort of poking you But you're not actually stabbed right?

804
00:51:57,972 --> 00:52:16,960
Scott: They're just sort of poking you and you're like, uh, Yeah To the point where you're actually made, you know You got to keep it going can't actually stab anyone with the spikes but you got to get it to the point where they're worried and then At the last second instead of you know, it stops or it pulls back or there's squishy spikes or anything like that.

805
00:52:17,742 --> 00:52:22,600
Scott: You got to do something else and my idea that I came up with was spikes coming down from the ceiling.

806
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:31,320
Scott: You're basically lying on the floor sucking in your gut and then the floor opens and you fall Alright, so you're actually falling now.

807
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:37,043
Scott: You obviously can't make me fall too far because they'll get hurt and you can't make them fall onto something dangerous because they will get Hurt.

808
00:52:37,083 --> 00:52:37,691
Scott: you don't want to do that.

809
00:52:37,752 --> 00:52:38,602
Scott: That's not cool That's.

810
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:41,420
Scott: you might as well go to the haunted house with the waterboarding if you can do that, right?

811
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:44,813
Scott: But while you're falling that you a surprise.

812
00:52:44,853 --> 00:52:46,200
Scott: you are actually falling now.

813
00:52:46,923 --> 00:52:50,156
Scott: Your body will go and now you might think that's a startling kind of cheating.

814
00:52:50,216 --> 00:52:50,557
Scott: it is.

815
00:52:50,577 --> 00:52:52,364
Scott: it is so what you.

816
00:52:52,424 --> 00:52:59,952
Scott: but the thing is immediately after the startling part comes you use that to basically, that's not the thing itself.

817
00:53:00,033 --> 00:53:08,900
Scott: what it is is the disabling and distraction of the minds that the fear can come in without time to process the Doubt.

818
00:53:09,362 --> 00:53:20,439
Scott: and what you see is when you look down there would be some while you're still falling in that, you know mere moments there would be an illusion of some kinds that you look like you're gonna fall onto deadly spikes below.

819
00:53:20,459 --> 00:53:32,374
Scott: and You know, you might think yeah, those are fake, but you don't have time to think that when you're falling like that now I think a low and then of course It's just an illusion and you fall into something soft and go a lower.

820
00:53:32,394 --> 00:53:37,719
Rym: if I way to do that Would be to do it is obviously very high-five would be to do a blindfolded haunted house.

821
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:50,297
Rym: Not bad, but then I know where you are blindfolded and then led Well, you know like holding hands Okay, very long distance because then there's the fear of what if they fuck up that'll be increasingly grow.

822
00:53:50,317 --> 00:53:51,300
Scott: that would not grow.

823
00:53:51,421 --> 00:53:54,080
Scott: I just feel like yeah, I know they're leading me a safe place because the haunted house?

824
00:53:54,201 --> 00:53:55,193
Rym: No, but they might make a mistake.

825
00:53:55,234 --> 00:53:55,740
Rym: They might remember.

826
00:53:56,621 --> 00:53:58,029
Scott: Now I would not be worried about that.

827
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:05,929
Rym: I'm not worried about scaring you because fuck you I wanted to make a haunted house that scares most people as opposed to Well, if you want it most people are pussies.

828
00:54:05,969 --> 00:54:07,738
Scott: you can scare him with a baby rollercoaster.

829
00:54:07,758 --> 00:54:08,120
Scott: you can eat.

830
00:54:08,361 --> 00:54:16,200
Rym: I still feel my favorite haunted house idea is to do the sort of Meta haunted house where you've got like the normal haunted house.

831
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:33,380
Rym: There's the normal dressed up guy and he's dressed up as like the Jason serial killer and he's doing his thing And then he notices another guy who's kind of normal looking and then they have like a little confrontation And then the first guy just fucking stabs him and the other guy runs and it seems like it's a serial killer got loose.

832
00:54:33,962 --> 00:54:34,945
Scott: Everyone who would not?

833
00:54:34,985 --> 00:54:35,948
Scott: who would actually believe that?

834
00:54:36,149 --> 00:54:38,175
Rym: I think a lot of you would believe it morons.

835
00:54:38,878 --> 00:54:39,600
Rym: That's how people roll.

836
00:54:40,621 --> 00:54:49,220
Rym: Plus really the proper way to do a scare haunted house is to make it not a haunted house But more like a prank more like a good night for flying.

837
00:54:49,421 --> 00:54:50,967
Scott: Well, that's the other thing right.

838
00:54:51,007 --> 00:54:52,774
Scott: as soon as you've got somebody know.

839
00:54:52,794 --> 00:54:53,456
Scott: that's the best.

840
00:54:53,497 --> 00:55:00,046
Scott: the challenge though right is if you bring me in, you know, someone who's very hard to scare and I don't know.

841
00:55:00,066 --> 00:55:00,648
Scott: I'm going it.

842
00:55:00,729 --> 00:55:04,886
Scott: if I know I'm going in a haunted house, then the shields It's like shields on full.

843
00:55:04,946 --> 00:55:05,648
Scott: you ain't get me with.

844
00:55:05,688 --> 00:55:11,069
Rym: so do it like a Japanese show like the one with the sniper if I Sniper start shooting everyone in the room.

845
00:55:11,089 --> 00:55:13,480
Scott: I do not know I'm going into a haunted house.

846
00:55:14,341 --> 00:55:19,380
Scott: Then it's really much much easier to scare me because I do not have the shields on full.

847
00:55:19,862 --> 00:55:23,820
Scott: You know if someone just like fucking dies, I'll be like in the middle of the street while I'm walking to work.

848
00:55:24,202 --> 00:55:28,180
Scott: I think that that's what happened right as opposed to in the haunted house.

849
00:55:28,542 --> 00:55:32,440
Scott: If someone dies, my first thought is yeah, that's fake.

850
00:55:32,942 --> 00:55:36,980
Rym: So maybe you just make an old house like a bed-and-breakfast that people go up to and you know, it's not a haunted house.

851
00:55:37,841 --> 00:55:43,440
Rym: But you just run a haunted house like spooky shit happens for the people who don't realize it's on a house.

852
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,286
Scott: Yeah, they just think they're staying in a bed-and-breakfast.

853
00:55:45,327 --> 00:55:49,180
Rym: legit and then you know, it escalates and scary shit keeps happening.

854
00:55:50,021 --> 00:55:51,407
Scott: Yeah, that that totally works.

855
00:55:51,527 --> 00:55:53,596
Rym: The thing is that that's too easy.

856
00:55:53,656 --> 00:55:54,600
Rym: No, it's not too easy.

857
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:56,343
Scott: No, it's a haunted house.

858
00:55:56,383 --> 00:56:00,313
Rym: That edges away from haunted house and into prank territory.

859
00:56:00,534 --> 00:56:04,465
Scott: Yes, but it's also too too easy For it's like shoot.

860
00:56:04,525 --> 00:56:05,228
Scott: It's easy to shoot.

861
00:56:05,248 --> 00:56:07,860
Scott: a guy doesn't have shields up to hit a guy when he's got full armor.

862
00:56:08,261 --> 00:56:09,285
Scott: That is hard Scott.

863
00:56:09,325 --> 00:56:12,495
Rym: If I manage some shields, you gotta get rid of those shields.

864
00:56:12,876 --> 00:56:14,040
Scott: No, you just have to penetrate.

865
00:56:15,541 --> 00:56:16,809
Rym: So this is all about penetration.

866
00:56:16,929 --> 00:56:17,211
Scott: That's right.

867
00:56:17,271 --> 00:56:19,665
Rym: You should go to that sexual assault creep You want in New York City?

868
00:56:19,705 --> 00:56:21,032
Scott: You got to use missiles that go.

869
00:56:21,052 --> 00:56:22,520
Rym: I don't know if they actually penetrate you.

870
00:56:22,764 --> 00:56:23,437
Scott: I don't think they do.

871
00:56:25,463 --> 00:56:26,971
Rym: The reviews of that thing were weird.

872
00:56:27,494 --> 00:56:28,680
Scott: It's not something I'm gonna pay money.

873
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:37,738
Rym: but no, I'm a big fan of the haunted house or something like it where literally Everyone is in on the gimmick except one person not just on house.

874
00:56:37,818 --> 00:56:46,560
Rym: in general I love anything where there is one person and Everyone else involved in the situation is in on something that they are not in.

875
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:56,820
Scott: I remember this one prank where they had this friend who is some dumb girl who believed that in like the rapture and shit and Then like she went to the bathroom and they all left their stuff behind and she thought the rapture it happened.

876
00:56:57,383 --> 00:57:00,580
Scott: That's that kind of thing my favorite, but that's only worked on a really dumb person.

877
00:57:01,122 --> 00:57:06,785
Rym: Ah, but the the good night for flying would work on anyone that combined Hi-fi special effects.

878
00:57:06,925 --> 00:57:07,366
Scott: That's true.

879
00:57:07,667 --> 00:57:16,495
Rym: artful like, you know an artful setup good acting and everyone sticking to the part Mm-hmm, and the person didn't know they were going on.

880
00:57:16,555 --> 00:57:17,640
Rym: but then here's the problem.

881
00:57:17,821 --> 00:57:28,400
Rym: Even if you do that in a situation where it is a haunted house Like say it's a haunted house like a whole bunch of friends go But actually ahead of time all but one friend is in on some elaborate plot.

882
00:57:30,221 --> 00:57:34,655
Rym: The problem is that's impractical because that's the same level as close-up magic.

883
00:57:34,936 --> 00:57:36,100
Rym: close-up magic is awesome.

884
00:57:36,521 --> 00:57:37,264
Rym: That is magic.

885
00:57:37,344 --> 00:57:44,408
Rym: or you have a magician like a Penn and Teller level magician doing tricks for you Only in front of you at a table.

886
00:57:44,529 --> 00:57:45,412
Scott: Here's another idea.

887
00:57:45,432 --> 00:57:46,235
Scott: I just came up with.

888
00:57:46,255 --> 00:57:47,620
Scott: it's somewhat of a genius idea.

889
00:57:48,082 --> 00:57:51,060
Scott: You go into a haunted house, it's just a very good haunted house.

890
00:57:51,261 --> 00:57:52,813
Scott: Maybe it has some really good stuff.

891
00:57:52,834 --> 00:57:53,620
Rym: your friend disappears.

892
00:57:54,344 --> 00:57:54,806
Scott: So you are.

893
00:57:54,866 --> 00:57:57,439
Scott: no you are satisfied with the price you pay for this haunted house.

894
00:57:58,582 --> 00:58:03,052
Scott: Then you exit the haunted house Believing it is over when it is.

895
00:58:03,092 --> 00:58:04,680
Scott: In fact not over.

896
00:58:05,162 --> 00:58:06,647
Rym: I was in a haunted house.

897
00:58:06,768 --> 00:58:08,514
Rym: once for example, I had the exit right.

898
00:58:08,695 --> 00:58:16,063
Scott: for example at the end of the haunted house There would be a gift shop like a cracker barrel, but then serial killer jumps out in the gift shop No more.

899
00:58:16,123 --> 00:58:18,631
Scott: like you just get fucking abducted in the gift shop.

900
00:58:18,712 --> 00:58:19,273
Scott: and you're like you.

901
00:58:19,394 --> 00:58:27,779
Scott: you're in a you know places that look normal Like someone grabs you and pulls you into like the janitor closet and it's just a janitor closet, but it's like oh fucking shit, right?

902
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:33,659
Scott: It's like you could get someone with that kind of thing Because they believe the haunted house is over and there's just like a crazy person.

903
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:37,180
Scott: So I was at the at the you know haunted hayride area.

904
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:40,816
Scott: It was no game on the house right at the pumpkin farm and then you see a thing that's like exit.

905
00:58:40,856 --> 00:58:42,749
Rym: you walk out and you're In this like you're.

906
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:45,305
Rym: like it looks like you're in the parking lot But really you don't kind of notice.

907
00:58:45,345 --> 00:58:51,260
Rym: but actually there's some stuff further on and it's still kind of like cordoned off But you don't realize it right away because you feel like you're in the parking lot.

908
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:59,817
Rym: They got a bunch of cars parked there and then they have this one fake car that Suddenly revs up and comes right at you and stops like a foot away from hitting you.

909
00:59:00,017 --> 00:59:03,228
Rym: Not bad Just a boo, but you know what?

910
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:09,100
Scott: Well, no, it's a boo when the car revs up But when the car is coming at you now, it's fear of dying.

911
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,368
Rym: But it's fear of dying if you go.

912
00:59:11,528 --> 00:59:15,804
Rym: if you believe not haunted house, of course just asshole driver It's fear.

913
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,816
Scott: Well, you could believe that there's a ghost driving.

914
00:59:17,896 --> 00:59:21,675
Scott: No, you couldn't If you were dumb.

915
00:59:21,696 --> 00:59:28,386
Scott: but no but you could you know that you would actually have real fear if you if you actually thought the car was gonna hit you and You didn't say it's gonna stop.

916
00:59:28,486 --> 00:59:30,435
Rym: So here's what you do at the end.

917
00:59:30,515 --> 00:59:31,520
Rym: There's a gift shop, right?

918
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:38,893
Rym: Yeah You get to the gift shop and there's a bunch of people laying like dead covered in blood In what looks like the gift shop and stuff's all fucked up.

919
00:59:39,677 --> 00:59:50,189
Rym: and then a bunch of cops bust in with guns and point them at you and start screaming at everyone to get on the ground and then make you lay on the ground While they investigate this grizzly murder for like five minutes.

920
00:59:50,209 --> 00:59:51,213
Scott: Here's another way to do it.

921
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:52,659
Scott: Imagine this scenario, right?

922
00:59:52,699 --> 00:59:53,445
Rym: Yeah I'm listening.

923
00:59:53,566 --> 01:00:00,420
Scott: so you go to a Farm on Halloween at night and it's got a pumpkin patch and it's got the corn maze and it's got all the two.

924
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:03,433
Scott: You know apple cider doughnuts all this stuff, right?

925
01:00:03,714 --> 01:00:05,020
Scott: There is no haunted house there.

926
01:00:05,382 --> 01:00:05,985
Scott: There is.

927
01:00:06,326 --> 01:00:07,794
Scott: maybe there's a corny haunted hayride.

928
01:00:07,834 --> 01:00:08,960
Scott: that kind of sucks, right?

929
01:00:09,321 --> 01:00:13,760
Scott: And that's you know, you're just hanging out with the family at the nice haunted fall activity, right?

930
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,840
Scott: But then see you don't have any thought that you're in a haunted house.

931
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:19,940
Scott: You're just standing in line for fucking cider doughnuts, right?

932
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,134
Scott: Cuz that's the longest line and you got your apple cider.

933
01:00:22,155 --> 01:00:22,940
Scott: you're sipping it, right?

934
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:31,572
Scott: But then actually the whole thing is a haunted event You just don't know and there was no way for you to expect that to be.

935
01:00:31,592 --> 01:00:40,060
Scott: and then the shit goes down on the whole place at the same time Right and as long as it's done in a way, that's believable.

936
01:00:40,462 --> 01:00:45,100
Rym: So if you go full-on cuz remember, you know Penn and Teller one of their big things I just keep bringing it up lately.

937
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:57,857
Rym: It seems like the right time is that they always make this point that their magic really works because Nobody really believes that someone would put forth that much effort exactly.

938
01:00:57,877 --> 01:01:00,447
Rym: and the answer is yes They put forth that much ever had to put.

939
01:01:00,507 --> 01:01:03,278
Rym: someone really practiced crawling through a tube like that.

940
01:01:03,318 --> 01:01:07,240
Scott: Yes So you just have to put that much effort into that giant event.

941
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:10,179
Rym: All right, so that giant event scare all the people who had giant event.

942
01:01:10,781 --> 01:01:17,659
Rym: Everyone at the event except you like the like maybe like the people who paid tickets like maybe 20 people there aren't in on it.

943
01:01:18,102 --> 01:01:19,273
Rym: Everyone else there is in.

944
01:01:19,313 --> 01:01:19,999
Scott: I think it's better.

945
01:01:21,521 --> 01:01:23,373
Scott: Staff and the police are in on it.

946
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:26,819
Scott: and maybe in the fire department I'm talking like none of the people who paid to be there.

947
01:01:27,061 --> 01:01:34,259
Rym: I'm talking like zombies break out but you start to realize that you know Hundreds and hundreds of people here are all Acting like zombies.

948
01:01:34,762 --> 01:01:35,787
Scott: it's too many you want to get.

949
01:01:35,807 --> 01:01:41,920
Scott: the thing is if you put that much effort you could find a way to Scare most of the people and not actually have to have all the people in on it.

950
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:42,664
Scott: You could just bring in.

951
01:01:42,684 --> 01:01:43,669
Scott: you know outside people.

952
01:01:43,769 --> 01:01:45,960
Rym: I know I just really dig and then you could do people.

953
01:01:46,321 --> 01:01:48,549
Scott: You could do really cool stuff like fucking.

954
01:01:48,569 --> 01:01:53,987
Scott: the place is fucking on fire and you're trapped inside and the fire Departments coming and you think it's a real fire.

955
01:01:54,067 --> 01:01:56,956
Rym: and but then again, it's not a haunted house.

956
01:01:57,297 --> 01:01:58,220
Scott: go set the fire.

957
01:02:01,362 --> 01:02:04,278
Rym: That's why I think the best haunted houses would be ones that aren't advertised as such.

958
01:02:04,318 --> 01:02:05,564
Rym: however You know what that leads to.

959
01:02:05,584 --> 01:02:09,260
Rym: an episode of unsolved mystery is about the haunted bed-and-breakfast.

960
01:02:10,161 --> 01:02:12,438
Scott: George Washington stayed here and his ghost talked to me.

961
01:02:14,782 --> 01:02:15,849
Rym: So maybe that's it.

962
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:17,380
Rym: maybe we need to take the next level.

963
01:02:17,681 --> 01:02:22,582
Rym: We need to go to like all the beds and breakfasts in places like that and you plant the seed Like in.

964
01:02:22,622 --> 01:02:29,264
Rym: will he run here's another great and then you just have the ghost of George Washington talk to someone and never Up to it.

965
01:02:29,566 --> 01:02:36,635
Scott: here is that now that guy Scott thinks he saw a ghost I have an idea that might land you in trouble, but it will absolutely work.

966
01:02:36,695 --> 01:02:37,418
Scott: every time one time.

967
01:02:37,498 --> 01:02:38,080
Rym: I saw goes.

968
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:38,843
Scott: This is the idea.

969
01:02:38,863 --> 01:02:43,763
Scott: I just came up with two seconds ago reverse haunted house we are.

970
01:02:43,803 --> 01:02:54,979
Scott: we just go to a bed-and-breakfast and we haunt the fuck out of the people who own it or We go to a regular boring ass haunted hayride as customers But we just haunt the fuck out of the people who work there.

971
01:02:55,662 --> 01:03:00,020
Scott: Right because it's like they're just some guy standing in a costume but jumps out and goes boo every time.

972
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:07,880
Rym: Oh, yes, this is we And I'm dressed up as like a skeleton monster and I just come up behind the guy who's working the boo factory.

973
01:03:08,141 --> 01:03:11,149
Scott: Yeah, you can totally scare the fuck out of those people.

974
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:12,052
Scott: real easy, right?

975
01:03:12,172 --> 01:03:17,972
Scott: or you know, we go to a haunted Cheesy Frankenstein house in Niagara Falls and scare the fuck out of.

976
01:03:17,992 --> 01:03:18,514
Scott: he was gone.

977
01:03:18,555 --> 01:03:19,980
Rym: that has a secondary effect.

978
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:21,989
Scott: So say the hayride going to jail for?

979
01:03:22,130 --> 01:03:22,492
Scott: no.

980
01:03:22,652 --> 01:03:24,260
Rym: No, so the hayrides coming up, right?

981
01:03:25,421 --> 01:03:29,640
Rym: The boo factory guy comes out to do his boo and the kids go and the adults go hahaha.

982
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:35,438
Rym: and then me and my skeleton costume taps him on the shoulder and he goes on runs away.

983
01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:38,235
Rym: a Percentage of the people who went haha before now go.

984
01:03:38,476 --> 01:03:39,020
Scott: Ah, yeah.

985
01:03:39,462 --> 01:03:47,235
Scott: So now I have upped the ante on everyone especially if I then disappear and since you do not work for the place You get up there and actually like fuck with the people.

986
01:03:47,275 --> 01:03:49,083
Rym: serious like no You don't even have to.

987
01:03:49,164 --> 01:03:54,659
Rym: then you disappear like dish like destroy the costume and just leave That way.

988
01:03:55,354 --> 01:04:05,345
Rym: You know There's this rumor like the one guy's like this fucking skeleton monster came out who was dressed up as that and now you've scared them all in the meta because they're all like there was No one in a costume like that.

989
01:04:05,847 --> 01:04:06,228
Rym: Haha.

990
01:04:06,650 --> 01:04:12,055
Rym: You must just have been seeing things but in the back of their mind They're all like Or you know you could do right.

991
01:04:12,135 --> 01:04:18,731
Scott: you best Imagine the haunted hayride is going along right and there's the people working it or doing their thing But you and me are hiding in the woods.

992
01:04:18,791 --> 01:04:19,920
Scott: We snuck onto the property, right?

993
01:04:20,382 --> 01:04:25,480
Scott: I got like a Jason thing going on and like I had you to death and you bleed all over the fucking die, right?

994
01:04:25,941 --> 01:04:28,314
Scott: Yeah, but then you know the people working the haunted hair.

995
01:04:28,334 --> 01:04:29,440
Scott: I would be make sure they see it.

996
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:30,669
Scott: So they're like what the fuck?

997
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:32,220
Scott: that's not part of our haunted hayride?

998
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:37,000
Scott: Well, yeah, and they come over to investigate but by then both of us are gone, but they swear to fucking God.

999
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:37,989
Scott: They saw exactly.

1000
01:04:38,029 --> 01:04:39,200
Scott: now they are fucking hidden.

1001
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:42,011
Scott: We get like camo and we hide under like, you know a sheet of leaves.

1002
01:04:42,051 --> 01:04:44,200
Rym: now Scott there you're talking leaves a leaf blanket.

1003
01:04:44,281 --> 01:04:45,596
Rym: Here's why that is great.

1004
01:04:46,523 --> 01:04:49,776
Rym: Look at the normal person who shrieks and actually gets like startled and scared.

1005
01:04:49,796 --> 01:04:55,020
Rym: it even based on houses They're okay at the end because you know what they get they get closure.

1006
01:04:55,362 --> 01:05:01,180
Rym: There is eventually an exit where they say, you know The context has changed kind of like how when humans walk through doors, they forget stuff.

1007
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:03,708
Rym: Yeah, the experience is over.

1008
01:05:04,209 --> 01:05:12,180
Rym: if you do a meta thing like that with no closure Even if it's a minor thing like like it's the same as goodnight for flying.

1009
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:14,226
Rym: They're second-guessing what they actually saw.

1010
01:05:14,667 --> 01:05:16,352
Rym: they start thinking did I really see that?

1011
01:05:16,653 --> 01:05:19,120
Rym: I remember seeing it, but no one else saw it.

1012
01:05:19,421 --> 01:05:20,424
Rym: There's no evidence.

1013
01:05:20,785 --> 01:05:25,259
Rym: and now they're weirded out, but they never get closure because you just went back home.

1014
01:05:26,272 --> 01:05:26,780
Scott: Yeah, we're hot.

1015
01:05:27,101 --> 01:05:31,456
Scott: We had like a blanket covered in leaves so hide under it until no no and then we both.

1016
01:05:31,476 --> 01:05:43,231
Rym: if you do that Every year at like one towns like haunted hayride Eventually the workers at that haunted hayride don't be actually afraid of ghosts No, but they'll be camping out for you.

1017
01:05:43,251 --> 01:05:44,560
Rym: No, they won't spot.

1018
01:05:45,244 --> 01:05:51,082
Rym: No, you do something different and fucked up every year And then one year you don't do any to us Simultaneously.

1019
01:05:51,464 --> 01:05:54,954
Scott: make sure it matches some local legend or spread a legend to match.

1020
01:05:55,215 --> 01:05:56,720
Rym: Yeah now we're talking.

1021
01:05:57,564 --> 01:05:58,759
Rym: So GeekNights listeners.

1022
01:06:00,062 --> 01:06:00,967
Rym: You know what to do.

1023
01:06:01,751 --> 01:06:02,615
