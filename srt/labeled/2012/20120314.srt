1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:08,920
Scott:

2
00:00:09,251 --> 00:00:12,240
Rym: It's Wednesday, March 14th, 2012.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:12,761
Rym: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:12,962 --> 00:00:13,523
Scott: I'm Scott.

5
00:00:13,624 --> 00:00:15,289
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

6
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:18,891
Rym: Tonight, the order of the stick.

7
00:00:23,174 --> 00:00:24,234
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:30,938 --> 00:00:33,580
Rym: So, uh, this morning, I had a pleasant surprise.

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,567
Rym: I woke up, and who should be at my door?

10
00:00:36,627 --> 00:00:38,011
Rym: but BK?

11
00:00:38,031 --> 00:00:41,099
Scott: Uh, that's not a surprise.

12
00:00:41,139 --> 00:00:41,821
Scott: I checked the weather.

13
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:46,260
Scott: I knew that there was smooth sailing, so the pirates would definitely be in town.

14
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,901
Rym: But I woke up late, so I thought, eh, maybe I shouldn't, uh, you know, my bike's not even ready.

15
00:00:50,921 --> 00:00:51,082
Scott: Why me?

16
00:00:51,102 --> 00:00:53,053
Scott: BK shows up at your door, you get on his boat.

17
00:00:53,676 --> 00:00:54,440
Scott: Wait a minute, what the fuck?

18
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,815
Scott: If you don't do that, you're stuck at, like, the beginning of the game.

19
00:00:56,835 --> 00:00:57,520
Scott: You can't get anywhere.

20
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,778
Scott: 'Cause my boat- Where you gonna get in life if you don't ride the pirate ship?

21
00:01:00,818 --> 00:01:01,703
Rym: My boat wasn't ready.

22
00:01:01,784 --> 00:01:06,027
Scott: You're never gonna get, you're never gonna see the Silver Sword shop, even if you had a thousand coins to buy.

23
00:01:06,047 --> 00:01:08,016
Rym: I actually, it took me a while.

24
00:01:08,036 --> 00:01:11,872
Rym: I had to, like, pump my tires up and do greasing and all this stuff to my bike.

25
00:01:11,912 --> 00:01:13,177
Rym: I did that in advance.

26
00:01:13,518 --> 00:01:13,980
Rym: I did not.

27
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:15,687
Scott: 'Cause I checked the forecast.

28
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:17,936
Rym: Ah, but I was busy burning characters.

29
00:01:17,956 --> 00:01:18,980
Scott: As a good sailor should.

30
00:01:21,321 --> 00:01:27,706
Rym: So we'll see, it's biking season, and, uh, Scott and I are actually in the, uh, like, New York Five Borough tour thing.

31
00:01:27,766 --> 00:01:29,212
Scott: It's not a race, it's a tour.

32
00:01:29,693 --> 00:01:31,600
Scott: Yeah, but people do- Like, little kids are in it and shit.

33
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,898
Rym: Yeah, but people do treat it as a race, but they put those people in a group by themselves.

34
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:36,768
Scott: I'm sure there's some people who can try to race.

35
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:39,100
Rym: I'm gonna go as fast as I can, I'm gonna try to set a time.

36
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:40,504
Rym: It's only, like, 40 miles.

37
00:01:40,544 --> 00:01:41,647
Scott: Like, it's not even that far.

38
00:01:41,687 --> 00:01:43,492
Scott: I'm just gonna go and go.

39
00:01:44,013 --> 00:01:46,520
Rym: I am gonna try to get a time lapse of the whole thing with the GoPro.

40
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,086
Scott: Uh, I should try to do the same thing.

41
00:01:48,106 --> 00:01:49,613
Rym: Actually, you know what I'll do tomorrow morning?

42
00:01:49,654 --> 00:01:50,900
Rym: I'll get a time lapse of my commute.

43
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,589
Scott: I'd do the same thing, but how are you gonna attach your GoPro to your bike?

44
00:01:55,051 --> 00:01:57,800
Rym: Uh, I have a thing that mounts it to my handlebars.

45
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,064
Scott: You got these special extra handlebar mounts?

46
00:02:00,084 --> 00:02:01,808
Rym: Yeah, it was like, it was like eight bucks.

47
00:02:02,449 --> 00:02:06,659
Scott: Yeah, that's what I noticed is I bought it and then they didn't come with that handlebar mount and I was like, "What the

48
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:06,980
Scott: fuck?".

49
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,982
Rym: Oh, so you bought it too?

50
00:02:08,102 --> 00:02:11,370
Scott: Yeah, I was like, "None of these fucking things will go on

51
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:11,871
Scott: handlebars.".

52
00:02:11,891 --> 00:02:15,639
Scott: And they go on Amazon and I type it in and I'm like, "Oh, you make me buy an extra fucking thing, you piece of

53
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:15,739
Scott: shit.".

54
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,214
Rym: I'm not sure, like, I wanna try a time lapse with the handlebar and then a time lapse on the helmet to see which one, like, works better.

55
00:02:21,234 --> 00:02:23,440
Scott: The thing is, I don't even need to do a time lapse, I can just do a full lapse.

56
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,782
Rym: I could do that too.

57
00:02:25,623 --> 00:02:29,550
Rym: But, who's gonna watch 25 minutes of me biking through Williamsburg?

58
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,553
Scott: No, in post you speed it up, fast forward.

59
00:02:31,573 --> 00:02:32,956
Rym: Yeah, you know what happens when you speed it up?

60
00:02:32,996 --> 00:02:35,480
Rym: It drops frames, so why even bother taking them?

61
00:02:36,101 --> 00:02:36,502
Scott: Why not?

62
00:02:38,286 --> 00:02:43,797
Scott: You can adjust in post and get it exactly the right length you want it to be, as opposed to pre-setting the length.

63
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:44,920
Scott: and who knows what'll happen.

64
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,709
Rym: Alright, you try that and I'm gonna do it the way I know, editing video.

65
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,237
Rym: But with our powers combined now, we can do the 3D thing.

66
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,200
Rym: once they release that.

67
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:54,983
Scott: Uh, it's gonna be dumb.

68
00:02:55,424 --> 00:02:58,310
Rym: Well, it'll do real 3D, just do we wanna do real 3D or not?

69
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,071
Rym: Do we need to?

70
00:02:59,091 --> 00:02:59,673
Rym: No, it's dumb.

71
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:01,597
Rym: How is it dumb?

72
00:03:01,717 --> 00:03:03,220
Rym: What if you wanna do, like, mocap or something?

73
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,602
Scott: Nobody can watch it.

74
00:03:04,922 --> 00:03:06,845
Rym: Yeah, they can, actually YouTube supports 3D.

75
00:03:07,786 --> 00:03:10,830
Scott: Nobody has the glasses in the shit to watch it.

76
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,474
Rym: Uh, you know, the sad thing is, you forget because you're old.

77
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:17,900
Scott: Except for when you go to PAX at the Nvidia booth and they have the little demo machine, no one has that shit.

78
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,967
Rym: No, Scott, you forget because you're old, but punk kids who are into PC gaming seem to all have that.

79
00:03:23,347 --> 00:03:25,670
Scott: So an audience of like 10 dudes has that shit.

80
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:26,111
Rym: Yeah.

81
00:03:26,251 --> 00:03:32,820
Scott: So it's worth it, we're gonna make a special video just for those 10 dudes who bought the crazy Nvidia goggles and have the right video card.

82
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,424
Rym: We'll make one particular 3D video or two.

83
00:03:35,444 --> 00:03:37,307
Scott: Uh, yeah, you know what it is?

84
00:03:37,327 --> 00:03:38,389
Scott: It's me giving you the finger.

85
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:39,691
Rym: I just wanna try it out.

86
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:41,274
Scott: 3D finger!

87
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:44,960
Scott: I also wanna try stuff like, uh- You don't even have the goggles, you don't even know if it works!

88
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:52,994
Rym: I also wanna try stuff like doing two cameras in the same event, like a lot of snowboarders putting one on their helmet and one on the snowboard looking back up at them.

89
00:03:53,014 --> 00:03:53,915
Scott: Oh yeah, that's necessary.

90
00:03:54,216 --> 00:03:56,440
Rym: So we can do stuff like that, we can, uh, lend and lease.

91
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,723
Rym: Anyway, yeah, we're biking to work because it's warm out.

92
00:04:00,344 --> 00:04:10,478
Rym: And cons are coming up, so in the news, our friend Daryl Surratt is going, not to PAX, and not to Anime Boston- How could you not go to PAX?

93
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:11,940
Scott: Nerd card revoked.

94
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:18,309
Rym: And not to Anime Boston, where he is a fixture, but he's going to Sakura Con.

95
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:21,654
Scott: Well, he's never been to Seattle, I mean, you know, trip to Seattle, not bad.

96
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:23,818
Rym: But he could go to Seattle for PAX!

97
00:04:23,858 --> 00:04:25,440
Scott: That's when he should be going.

98
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,449
Rym: Because I love Daryl, and we're super into anime, Daryl's super into anime, but Daryl is also super into gaming.

99
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:41,220
Rym: But, uh, I do forgive him a little because the reason he's going is to see Kawajiri Yoshiaki.

100
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,281
Scott: Well, that's his jam.

101
00:04:42,842 --> 00:04:45,865
Rym: That is his jam to a degree that I cannot fault him.

102
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:53,414
Rym: Though, I would not skip PAX if Lincoln, Kennedy, Imhotep, and Jesus.

103
00:04:53,714 --> 00:04:55,396
Scott: Why would I skip PAX for any of those guys?

104
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:58,560
Scott: I wouldn't even skip frickin' like Zenkai Con for any of those guys.

105
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,301
Rym: I can't think of, really?

106
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:01,542
Rym: You wouldn't defeat Imhotep?

107
00:05:02,663 --> 00:05:02,963
Scott: No?

108
00:05:03,204 --> 00:05:03,564
Rym: Why not?

109
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:04,965
Scott: What would I say to Imhotep?

110
00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:06,706
Rym: How'd you build the fuckin' pyramids?

111
00:05:06,847 --> 00:05:07,727
Scott: And what would he say?

112
00:05:07,747 --> 00:05:10,970
Rym: I don't know, whatever he, however he fixed the pyramids.

113
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:19,857
Rym: He wouldn't understand what I was saying to him, and he would probably say- Clearly, if there's a convention where they're all there, there's a moderator on the panel who speaks ancient Egyptian.

114
00:05:19,957 --> 00:05:23,580
Scott: Who on earth, currently living, speaks fluent ancient Egyptian?

115
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,221
Rym: Imhotep.

116
00:05:26,463 --> 00:05:28,686
Rym: In this case, we've got Imhotep.

117
00:05:28,706 --> 00:05:31,749
Scott: And also speaks another human language.

118
00:05:31,969 --> 00:05:37,535
Rym: So I'm assuming that if they were able to fly Imhotep out, they have someone who can translate.

119
00:05:37,556 --> 00:05:39,618
Rym: Because otherwise, how did they convince him to come to the con?

120
00:05:39,638 --> 00:05:41,340
Scott: They did, and the museum just fuckin' kidnapped him.

121
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,622
Rym: So, anyway.

122
00:05:45,022 --> 00:05:46,224
Rym: Besides, Jesus is fictional.

123
00:05:46,244 --> 00:05:47,727
Rym: You didn't harp on that, you harp on-.

124
00:05:48,828 --> 00:05:56,340
Rym: So, Kalajiri, if you didn't know, and you should know, you know, we haven't done a lot of anime shows lately, and when we have, we've just reviewed shows.

125
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:01,884
Rym: But, uh, he is famous for anime that you shouldn't watch, but you probably should watch.

126
00:06:01,984 --> 00:06:12,231
Rym: Like, I don't know, Wicked City, or maybe Demon City, Cyber City Oedo, Vampire Hunter D, the new one, not the old one.

127
00:06:12,871 --> 00:06:15,012
Rym: Well, recently, I don't know if he did anything on the old one.

128
00:06:15,032 --> 00:06:17,794
Rym: I actually don't know much about the old one, now that I think about it.

129
00:06:18,355 --> 00:06:20,036
Rym: I feel bad about that, and wrong.

130
00:06:20,056 --> 00:06:23,878
Rym: But anyway, this is Daryl's jam, so I can see why he's going, but-

131
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:39,740
Scott: It would cost him money to go to PAX, but this is free Seattle trip, so, you know, as I say, cost nothing, go to convention for your jam, or, I'd still go to PAX, but even if it cost all the money.

132
00:06:41,622 --> 00:06:44,700
Rym: You can tell there's not so much anime news lately.

133
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,503
Scott: No, so, I'm gonna do a geek bite, because there's no news.

134
00:06:48,123 --> 00:06:54,149
Scott: So, I was trying to think of what comics I read recently, and really, I haven't read that many comics recently, although I've still been buying plenty of them.

135
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,433
Scott: Mostly because I've been watching Running Man, but now that it's done, I'm reading again.

136
00:06:58,554 --> 00:07:05,200
Scott: So, anyway, I read Princess Knight by Tezuka, which is famous Tezuka shoujo manga.

137
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,542
Rym: I have not read it yet, though I know the end.

138
00:07:07,862 --> 00:07:09,604
Scott: Did you know- I know how it ends.

139
00:07:09,944 --> 00:07:10,805
Scott: It's not a surprise.

140
00:07:10,885 --> 00:07:11,125
Scott: Yeah.

141
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,267
Scott: Did you know it's only two volumes?

142
00:07:14,007 --> 00:07:17,671
Rym: Oh, uh, let me borrow it, like, now.

143
00:07:17,691 --> 00:07:19,312
Scott: Yeah, it's only two volumes, that's it.

144
00:07:19,432 --> 00:07:20,133
Scott: One, two, done.

145
00:07:20,153 --> 00:07:21,394
Rym: I guess I kind of had this impression.

146
00:07:21,414 --> 00:07:22,114
Rym: there was a lot of it.

147
00:07:22,174 --> 00:07:27,659
Scott: Yeah, I had a feeling- I also thought that it was a big, long manga, like Astro Boy with a bunch of volumes, but it's not.

148
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:28,780
Scott: It's only two volumes, and that's it.

149
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,681
Scott: It's pretty good.

150
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:49,135
Scott: Like, it's got a lot of cool stuff, it's got some cool characters, the pirate guy is the best, there's an awesome pirate, and also there's an evil witch, but the evil witch's daughter is actually kind of awesome, because there's this whole thing going on where, like, the evil witch wants the daughter to be an evil witch, but the daughter's like, "Eh, whatever, I don't really want to be an evil witch.

151
00:07:49,495 --> 00:07:54,179
Scott: Hey, my mom's making me do this evil witch shit, but come on, let's go and have fun or do whatever,".

152
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,900
Scott: you know, she's pretty cool and awesome.

153
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:12,840
Scott: The thing is, but it's not the best ever, it's not the best Tezuka, at least, not in my eyes, because the plot goes and goes and goes, and it's going a good direction, and then it sort of meanders a bit, like he doesn't know where to take it, and then he wraps it up.

154
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,942
Scott: And that doesn't know where to take it.

155
00:08:15,002 --> 00:08:21,591
Scott: kind of wishy-washy part, about 70-80% of the way through is kind of, "Eh, what's going on here, alright,".

156
00:08:21,611 --> 00:08:28,780
Scott: you know, this kind of cool stuff, but it doesn't really, it's not in the same, it sort of gets you out of the flow that you had going with the beginning parts.

157
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:35,340
Scott: But yeah, Princess Knight is Tezuka, it's excellent, and because it's only two volumes, you should buy that shit.

158
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:36,698
Scott: So I suppose I will read it.

159
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,480
Scott: It's also historically significant.

160
00:08:38,981 --> 00:08:41,099
Rym: And it'll give us a Wednesday show.

161
00:08:42,102 --> 00:08:42,419
Scott: Maybe.

162
00:08:42,732 --> 00:08:42,940
Scott: Maybe.

163
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:51,220
Scott: If that's not redundant with the Geek Fight I just did, which was barely much of a Geek Fight at all, I just, you know, since it's only two volumes, what do you want me to say about it?

164
00:08:51,480 --> 00:09:01,840
Scott: It's a story about this girl who, when she's born, right, God and all the angels, right, God's standing up there, and all the angels are like, "Alright, make sure you give the boy hearts to the boys and the girl hearts to the

165
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,040
Scott: girls.".

166
00:09:02,081 --> 00:09:03,219
Scott: The angels are distributing the hearts.

167
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,820
Scott: And one of them, by some circumstance, gets a boy heart and a girl heart.

168
00:09:08,121 --> 00:09:10,280
Scott: But it's a girl, but it has both hearts.

169
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:12,200
Scott: So she's total badass, right?

170
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,680
Rym: Because girls can't be badasses.

171
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,460
Scott: Well, it's sort of sexist, and it's also not at the same time, right?

172
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:27,359
Scott: Because on the one hand, it's like, "Okay, the boy heart makes you courageous and awesome at fighting and stuff like that, and the girl heart makes you pretty and beautiful and

173
00:09:27,439 --> 00:09:27,700
Scott: sweet.".

174
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,935
Scott: And it's sort of like, "Alright, that part is

175
00:09:28,955 --> 00:09:29,239
Scott: sexist.".

176
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:36,296
Scott: But at the same time, it's like, "Well, they're both in this girl, so it's still giving you this girl who's also badass and kind of

177
00:09:36,316 --> 00:09:36,597
Scott: whatever.".

178
00:09:38,861 --> 00:09:46,860
Scott: But anyway, so she's like the princess, but totally pretending to be the prince so that she can be the king or whatever eventually.

179
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:54,500
Scott: And of course, people try to find this out and uncover the secret so that other people can be the king instead, and all this sort of stuff.

180
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:03,500
Scott: And then she meets boys, but then she's switching between being in a costume, dressing as a girl and dressing as a guy, and going in disguises.

181
00:10:03,801 --> 00:10:13,300
Scott: The guy she likes hates her when he thinks it's the prince, but is madly in love with her and thinks it's this beautiful girl who went to the dance, Cinderella-style.

182
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,240
Scott: That kind of stuff's going on, so that's what it's about.

183
00:10:17,901 --> 00:10:18,478
Rym: That's how that is.

184
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:29,299
Scott: The angel, because he fucked up and gave two hearts to one person, he's coming down trying to correct the mistake, but it's like, "Well, you don't really want the mistake

185
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:29,720
Scott: corrected.".

186
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:37,820
Scott: There's all kinds of situations where she loses one heart and now she's all girly and she can't really fight, but then she has to fight because she's dressed as the prince and a guy shows up with a sword.

187
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:45,734
Scott: And then maybe the heart switches back the other way, and now she's not girly anymore, so the guy wants to get with her, but she's like, "Whatever.

188
00:10:45,754 --> 00:10:47,558
Scott: I've got a boy heart now.

189
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:48,099
Scott: I don't want

190
00:10:48,139 --> 00:10:48,239
Scott: you.".

191
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:53,159
Rym: I feel like this would be very different if it was, instead of hearts, it was genitalia.

192
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:54,062
Scott: Yeah.

193
00:10:55,007 --> 00:10:57,460
Scott: Pretty sure she has the girl genitalia the whole time.

194
00:10:57,641 --> 00:10:58,100
Scott: Pretty sure?

195
00:10:58,361 --> 00:10:59,185
Scott: Yeah.

196
00:10:59,205 --> 00:11:01,939
Scott: There's a lot of Rose of Versailles going on.

197
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,633
Rym: So, things of the day.

198
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:14,557
Rym: This is pretty great.

199
00:11:14,577 --> 00:11:24,530
Rym: Way greater than you would expect a video like this to be, and all I want to say is it's funny right away, but if you wait for it, it is amazing.

200
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:29,543
Scott: Yeah, just watch this whole video and just don't get bored and try to fast-forward or anything like that.

201
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:30,887
Scott: Just wait for the payoff.

202
00:11:30,927 --> 00:11:32,090
Scott: Trust me, there is a payoff.

203
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,432
Rym: Well, I'll bet you some money.

204
00:11:33,452 --> 00:11:38,519
Rym: I will bet you all that it is impossible to not start laughing.

205
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:46,150
Rym: There is no way you can watch this video and make it past the 40-second mark without laughing out loud at least a little bit.

206
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:47,700
Scott: Unless you're a dupe.

207
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:50,730
Rym: What?

208
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:55,801
Scott: I just tried to combine doofus and derp, so maybe a derpus.

209
00:11:56,001 --> 00:11:56,703
Scott: I don't know what I said.

210
00:11:57,564 --> 00:11:58,086
Scott: It's recorded.

211
00:11:58,106 --> 00:11:58,827
Scott: You can go hear what I said.

212
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,168
Scott: Some new word.

213
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,977
Rym: When I was a really little kid, I remember I was mad at my little brother.

214
00:12:03,997 --> 00:12:04,678
Rym: I don't know why.

215
00:12:04,698 --> 00:12:06,922
Rym: I have no idea what I was mad about.

216
00:12:07,262 --> 00:12:11,610
Rym: So, I wanted to call him a scumbucket, but I kind of also wanted to call him a scum-sucker.

217
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:19,390
Rym: And I said scumbucker, which sounded like scum-fucker, and I got sent to my room for saying fuck.

218
00:12:20,331 --> 00:12:23,140
Scott: So, in first grade, I don't know if I told this story, right?

219
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:26,590
Scott: You know, I knew some bad words, but I didn't know all the bad words.

220
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:32,110
Rym: Every kid had a repertoire, like you collected them, like you had this little folder of bad words in the brain.

221
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,315
Scott: Didn't know all the bad words, though, right?

222
00:12:34,977 --> 00:12:40,330
Scott: So, you know, sitting in the back of the room, having a discussion about bad words with some of the kids.

223
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,708
Rym: When children share gnosis.

224
00:12:42,191 --> 00:12:44,340
Scott: Alright, and this kid's like, "Hey, you know that bad word?

225
00:12:44,922 --> 00:12:46,830
Scott: It's like itch, but there's a B in front of

226
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:46,930
Scott: it.".

227
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,536
Scott: I'm like, "Bitch?

228
00:12:47,556 --> 00:12:48,061
Scott: That's not even a

229
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:48,424
Scott: word."

230
00:12:49,851 --> 00:12:50,112
Scott: Right?

231
00:12:50,132 --> 00:12:53,082
Scott: And he's like, "Well, there's also, there's another one.

232
00:12:53,102 --> 00:12:53,604
Scott: It's duck.

233
00:12:53,664 --> 00:12:54,809
Scott: You replace the D with an

234
00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:54,849
Scott: F.".

235
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:55,893
Scott: I'm like, "Fuck?

236
00:12:56,154 --> 00:12:58,282
Scott: Fuck is absolutely not a word.

237
00:12:58,302 --> 00:12:59,848
Scott: There is no way that that's a

238
00:12:59,888 --> 00:13:00,189
Scott: word.".

239
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,583
Rym: Wait, so what bad words did you know?

240
00:13:02,663 --> 00:13:03,650
Rym: Like pee-pee and doo-doo?

241
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:04,815
Scott: I have no idea.

242
00:13:05,177 --> 00:13:07,310
Scott: All I knew is that I didn't believe that those were real words.

243
00:13:07,771 --> 00:13:09,878
Scott: So then, you know, the teacher's like, "What are you

244
00:13:09,918 --> 00:13:10,199
Scott: saying?".

245
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:13,750
Scott: I'm like, you know, the teacher thought I was just trying to get away with saying the words.

246
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,274
Scott: But I was like, "No, really.

247
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,318
Scott: Fuck is not a word.

248
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:17,883
Scott: There is no way that that's a word.

249
00:13:17,924 --> 00:13:18,305
Scott: It's not in the

250
00:13:18,345 --> 00:13:18,907
Scott: dictionary.".

251
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,113
Scott: I actually went and got the dictionary.

252
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,216
Scott: I was like, "Look, it's not in here.

253
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:24,161
Scott: It's not a word.

254
00:13:25,244 --> 00:13:26,286
Scott: Fuck is not a word.

255
00:13:26,326 --> 00:13:26,527
Scott: This is

256
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:27,008
Scott: bullshit.".

257
00:13:27,971 --> 00:13:31,550
Rym: I'm glad that our society is rapidly getting past that.

258
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:32,396
Scott: Yeah, no kidding.

259
00:13:33,588 --> 00:13:33,790
Scott: Anyway.

260
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:42,990
Rym: And of course, in the meta moment, we are going to be at the Penny Arcade Expo and Anime Boston, but mostly the Penny Arcade Expo.

261
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,594
Scott: Do we even have to say this?

262
00:13:44,634 --> 00:13:48,528
Scott: We're going to be at every Penny Arcade Expo that ever happens, ever, unless we are dead.

263
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:49,848
Rym: Unless we die or it ends.

264
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:54,384
Scott: Or unless somehow we are banned from it or something like that weird crazy happens.

265
00:13:54,464 --> 00:13:56,330
Scott: or there is something even more important.

266
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,072
Rym: You know what?

267
00:13:57,093 --> 00:14:02,029
Rym: I posit that we could not get banned because after that late show, they did not ban us.

268
00:14:02,952 --> 00:14:03,574
Scott: Something could happen.

269
00:14:03,614 --> 00:14:08,670
Scott: For example, I could be offered a free trip into outer space that happens to be on the same day as PAX.

270
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,204
Rym: Would you take outer space over PAX Prime?

271
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:13,530
Rym: Not East, but Prime.

272
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,096
Rym: So the line is space.

273
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,240
Scott: I mean, it would take a lot, but it's possible, right?

274
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,486
Scott: There are things that...

275
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,153
Rym: Alright, so here's the question.

276
00:14:22,615 --> 00:14:26,609
Rym: Would you at least contact the space guy and say, "Hey, can you wait a

277
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:26,809
Rym: week?"?

278
00:14:27,171 --> 00:14:28,156
Scott: I would ask, sure.

279
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,570
Scott: But you know, launches, they tend not to move.

280
00:14:32,151 --> 00:14:43,530
Scott: Or maybe I get a horrible disease and I'm not dead yet, but if I don't get this treatment instead of PAX and the treatment's only available somewhere far away from PAX, then I'll die.

281
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,309
Scott: But if I get the treatment, I'll live.

282
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:54,890
Rym: That is a nice game theory conundrum there because you'd miss one PAX, but get more than one PAX worth compared to dying.

283
00:14:55,010 --> 00:15:00,005
Scott: Of course, even with the treatment, if I wasn't going to live to the next PAX, I'd just go to the PAX and die.

284
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:01,550
Scott: I mean, obviously.

285
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,608
Rym: Scott was the one who famously said in our forum, "I would skip my own wedding for

286
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:05,850
Rym: PAX.".

287
00:15:07,171 --> 00:15:12,110
Scott: Well, I mean, if the person wasn't okay with that, I wouldn't be marrying them, right?

288
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,216
Rym: But yes, we will be there.

289
00:15:14,256 --> 00:15:17,230
Rym: We are doing a Let's Play money-making game.

290
00:15:17,611 --> 00:15:29,530
Rym: We are doing the GeekNights tabletop workshop, where over the course of two hours we will teach the entire audience in the tabletop workshop room, which is a classroom with tons of seats and tables in the audience.

291
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:34,480
Rym: We're going to teach Agricola and Carcassonne and a third secret game.

292
00:15:35,222 --> 00:15:35,684
Rym: Spot it.

293
00:15:36,265 --> 00:15:36,746
Rym: Probably.

294
00:15:36,766 --> 00:15:38,190
Rym: I haven't decided yet.

295
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,609
Scott: Oh, let's play the trigger game before I go.

296
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:40,051
Rym: Oh yeah.

297
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:43,930
Rym: We will also be doing a whole bunch of other stuff at PAX along with all of our friends.

298
00:15:44,371 --> 00:15:47,880
Rym: We will have a schedule of the good stuff to go to.

299
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:51,390
Rym: Meaning, our stuff, Luke Crane's stuff, Jared Sorensen's stuff.

300
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,450
Scott: The stuff that we approve of and is done by our friends.

301
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,910
Rym: Yep, Lorian Green's screening of Going Cardboard, which I haven't watched yet.

302
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:57,486
Rym: Which we're in.

303
00:15:58,251 --> 00:15:58,657
Rym: I have it.

304
00:15:58,739 --> 00:15:59,390
Rym: It's sitting right here.

305
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:02,029
Scott: It is a documentary about board games and we are in it.

306
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,698
Rym: So is Rainer Canizia.

307
00:16:03,778 --> 00:16:05,387
Rym: Therefore, we are...

308
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:08,821
Scott: We probably shouldn't be featured in it as much as we are, but we are.

309
00:16:08,881 --> 00:16:11,330
Scott: And two of the special features are mostly us.

310
00:16:11,551 --> 00:16:15,870
Rym: You know, I didn't think it'd be this early in my life where I was a special feature on a DVD.

311
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:16,654
Scott: Yeah.

312
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:22,150
Rym: Move the GloW to the menu item to open the special feature of the DVD.

313
00:16:22,931 --> 00:16:24,679
Scott: I guess to at least put us down a notch.

314
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,870
Scott: It's not a DVD they sell in Best Buy, right?

315
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:27,166
Scott: Yet.

316
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:27,868
Scott: Yeah.

317
00:16:29,011 --> 00:16:29,735
Rym: Best Buy.

318
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,950
Rym: I haven't been inside of a Best Buy in years.

319
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:37,750
Scott: I've been to some of the Manhattan ones while waiting to do something because I happen to be.

320
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,274
Scott: I was like, "I'm standing on the street.

321
00:16:39,334 --> 00:16:43,085
Scott: I have to be somewhere in 15 minutes, but where I have to be is right next to me.

322
00:16:43,386 --> 00:16:44,389
Scott: What am I going to do for 15

323
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:44,629
Scott: minutes?".

324
00:16:45,011 --> 00:16:46,199
Scott: There's a Best Buy here.

325
00:16:46,723 --> 00:16:47,790
Scott: And there's nothing else here.

326
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,869
Scott: Alright, let's go inside.

327
00:16:49,515 --> 00:16:49,790
Scott: So yeah.

328
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,030
Scott: And let's walk out without buying anything.

329
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,737
Rym: Anyway, we will be at PAX and Anime Boston.

330
00:16:53,838 --> 00:16:56,205
Rym: Anime Boston, we're doing one, two, or three panels.

331
00:16:56,245 --> 00:16:57,750
Rym: I gotta check my scheduling and all that.

332
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:05,369
Rym: But anyway, the book club book, which we'll do a show on announcing shortly, will be The Hunger Games because everyone's making a big ruckus about it.

333
00:17:06,671 --> 00:17:15,230
Rym: I read enough to realize that it's not... I started reading it thinking it was going to be a bad book and I was going to make fun of all my friends for recommending some kid's book.

334
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,584
Rym: But now, it's pretty good.

335
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:17,150
Rym: Pretty 1984.

336
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,949
Scott: Maybe I'll still end up making fun of it.

337
00:17:19,296 --> 00:17:19,527
Scott: You may.

338
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,848
Scott: It could be a Firefly situation.

339
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,051
Rym: But it was pretty good.

340
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,743
Rym: I don't think you'll dislike it.

341
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,609
Rym: Unless you want to dislike it.

342
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:28,698
Scott: I don't, you know.

343
00:17:29,042 --> 00:17:29,749
Scott: I just go into it.

344
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:30,688
Rym: It's hard to say.

345
00:17:32,231 --> 00:17:35,301
Rym: All that aside, this Friday, there's a NerdNYC board game night.

346
00:17:35,342 --> 00:17:37,810
Rym: We've missed several between me going to India and conventions.

347
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:38,389
Scott: I went to the last one.

348
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:39,670
Rym: I've missed several.

349
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,324
Scott: Well, I missed... They had some bonus ones lately.

350
00:17:42,364 --> 00:17:43,430
Scott: Like, there was one on a Tuesday.

351
00:17:43,751 --> 00:17:45,750
Rym: I would have gone, except I had stuff to do.

352
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,742
Scott: Yeah, I did not go to any bonus ones.

353
00:17:47,783 --> 00:17:48,789
Scott: I only went to regular ones.

354
00:17:50,132 --> 00:17:51,350
Rym: Trouble is, it's bike season.

355
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:51,994
Scott: Yep.

356
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:52,546
Scott: Also...

357
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:56,450
Rym: I can't leave my bike at the NerdNYC night unless I ride my shitty bike to work.

358
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,421
Scott: I just ride my bike home, then go to NerdNYC?

359
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,010
Scott: Or not ride my bike that day.

360
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:01,195
Rym: Ah, but I want to ride my bike.

361
00:18:01,215 --> 00:18:04,630
Rym: I think I'm going to ride my shitty bike to work on Friday morning if it doesn't rain.

362
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:10,470
Scott: Anyway, so, you should also remember, the internets exist, and we are on the internets.

363
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:33,490
Scott: So if you Facebook, Google+, Twitter, iTunes, websites, anything like that, you can follow, subscribe, join, grab... whatever, us, and get our stuffs, and hook up with us in a social way, and follow our shit, and you'll be notified about all our goings on, internet-wise.

364
00:18:33,951 --> 00:18:35,169
Rym: Most of them are pretty good.

365
00:18:36,592 --> 00:18:36,735
Rym: Yeah.

366
00:18:36,878 --> 00:18:37,328
Rym: Most of them.

367
00:18:37,652 --> 00:18:37,782
Scott: Most.

368
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:47,163
Rym: So, way back around 2003, which was a decade ago, almost, we discovered, and...

369
00:18:52,292 --> 00:18:55,410
Scott: had already died, but there were some other ones.

370
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:59,850
Rym: I think that might have been before, when it came back and died again, though.

371
00:19:00,311 --> 00:19:01,769
Scott: No, because it was all freshman year.

372
00:19:02,551 --> 00:19:05,330
Rym: No, it was sophomore year, some of it, because we were in Colony.

373
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:08,720
Rym: I will look it up, old man, with your Alzheimer's.

374
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,430
Rym: Introduce Order of the Stick while I look this up and prove your Alzheimer's.

375
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:16,410
Scott: So, you know, we played the D&Ds in those days, because you didn't know better, and there was no better in those days.

376
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,736
Rym: I know, we had not yet met Luke Crane.

377
00:19:18,756 --> 00:19:31,729
Rym: I knew the alternatives to D&D were, like, Shadowrun, Palladium Books, Call of Cthulhu, White Wolf, Legend of the Five Rings, Rifts, 7C, and older versions of Dungeons and Dragons.

378
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,609
Rym: I said Legend of the Five Rings.

379
00:19:34,693 --> 00:19:34,874
Scott: Oh.

380
00:19:34,894 --> 00:19:38,770
Scott: The thing is, you said Legend of the Five Rings, I said L5R, so it didn't match up.

381
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:44,049
Rym: I remember D20, there was a bunch of D20 stuff, like Star Wars D20, Cthulhu D20.

382
00:19:44,613 --> 00:19:45,130
Scott: Right, anyway.

383
00:19:45,335 --> 00:19:45,970
Rym: Old paranoia.

384
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:47,673
Scott: Yeah, well, paranoia, true.

385
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:58,805
Scott: Okay, so anyway, we played D&D, and, you know, D&D jokes are funny, like jokes about rolling D20s, and, you know, casting Magic Missile at the Darkness, and all those types of jokes.

386
00:19:59,247 --> 00:20:00,030
Scott: They were good jokes.

387
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:08,730
Rym: I mean, very often- Very often you would say something like, "Guess he didn't make his saving throw against flatulence," or whatever the issue was.

388
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:11,659
Scott: Jesus saves, and takes half damage.

389
00:20:12,241 --> 00:20:12,642
Scott: Classic.

390
00:20:12,823 --> 00:20:18,674
Rym: Alright, so- The Boys of Guter Science was dead in 2003.

391
00:20:18,674 --> 00:20:19,108
Scott: I told you.

392
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:31,310
Rym: But it went through summer of 2002, where we were not in fact freshmen at RIT, and where we were in fact living in colony.

393
00:20:32,912 --> 00:20:33,338
Scott: Oh, whatever.

394
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,558
Rym: Anyway, so- So you were all- you're an old man, you're wrong.

395
00:20:36,578 --> 00:20:41,015
Rym: I'm gonna read these VVOCSs while you- That's a good idea.

396
00:20:41,638 --> 00:20:42,642
Scott: Not you too, Tribes 2.

397
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:44,250
Scott: Alright, anyway.

398
00:20:45,071 --> 00:20:47,410
Rym: Oh my god, I remember every one of these strips.

399
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:48,259
Scott: Of course you do.

400
00:20:48,422 --> 00:20:48,949
Scott: Why wouldn't you?

401
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:54,110
Scott: So, in the webcomic heyday, right, one of our friends discovered this webcomic called Order of the Stig.

402
00:20:54,250 --> 00:21:04,950
Scott: So he told us about it, we started reading it, and it was basically- it started out as just this party of adventurers, you know, pretty typical, the big fighter leader guy, but he was also smart, so he wasn't so stereotypical.

403
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:08,218
Scott: The thiefy girl, all rogue you like.

404
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,967
Scott: The stupid bard, as opposed to the spoonie bard.

405
00:21:10,987 --> 00:21:11,769
Scott: Well, he's also spoonie.

406
00:21:12,811 --> 00:21:21,448
Scott: You know, the really stereotypical Thor dwarf cleric guy, and the evil hobbit kind of guy.

407
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:22,530
Scott: Halfling, whatever.

408
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,870
Scott: Oh, and then the elf wizard, who is sort of androgynous.

409
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:30,888
Rym: Yeah, they made a big deal- that was like one of the running gags was, "Well, is it a man or a

410
00:21:30,948 --> 00:21:31,270
Rym: woman?".

411
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:33,050
Scott: They haven't really answered that either.

412
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:34,108
Rym: It's obviously a man.

413
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,250
Scott: And the spouse is also androgynous.

414
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:37,170
Rym: Obviously a woman.

415
00:21:37,311 --> 00:21:38,745
Scott: Anyway, well, former spouse.

416
00:21:38,866 --> 00:21:39,290
Scott: Oh, spoilers.

417
00:21:41,632 --> 00:21:44,784
Scott: Anyway, so they're adventuring, not really for any particular reason.

418
00:21:44,884 --> 00:21:46,290
Scott: so much, at least not that I can remember.

419
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:55,609
Scott: And basically the whole comic just starts out with this sort of, you know, not the greatest artwork, you know, pretty much circle heads, and I almost could draw it if I put enough effort into it.

420
00:21:57,151 --> 00:21:59,054
Scott: And making all the D&D jokes in the world.

421
00:21:59,094 --> 00:22:09,367
Rym: Jokes about flumps, jokes about- Jokes about the conversion from second ed to third ed.

422
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:10,689
Scott: Oh my.

423
00:22:11,672 --> 00:22:23,230
Scott: Second one- So pretty much when we got to RIT is when third ed came out, so this, you know- Fail listen check joke, singing to tell a guy to jump over the pit, and then singing to bluff- Jump, jump, jump over the pit.

424
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,670
Rym: Bluff, bluff, bluff the stupid ogre.

425
00:22:25,652 --> 00:22:27,289
Scott: Bluff, bluff, bluff the stupid ogre.

426
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:30,869
Scott: You got the banjo the clown, you know, deity jokes.

427
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:34,610
Rym: My favorite spell in all of newer D&D, Expeditious Retreat.

428
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:37,167
Scott: Ah, I forgot about that one until just now.

429
00:22:37,288 --> 00:22:37,590
Scott: Excellent.

430
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:38,350
Scott: It's a good spell.

431
00:22:38,871 --> 00:22:39,112
Scott: It is.

432
00:22:39,535 --> 00:22:42,190
Scott: So, telling D&D jokes pretty much with web comics.

433
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:46,330
Scott: But then, as time went on, you know, of course it starts out with boring dungeoning.

434
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,829
Scott: Well, I mean, you know, not boring dungeoning, just silly dungeoning.

435
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,530
Scott: And, you know, there's an awesome bad guy, Zykon the Lich.

436
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:59,169
Scott: Can't do better than the Lich, especially since he's awesome with his skull head and his phylactery and his robes and his- Ah yeah, Zykon is the best.

437
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:02,430
Scott: So, you know, they're fighting the Zykon or whatever.

438
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:06,864
Scott: And then, over time, he's like, "Well, we sort of finished this dungeon.

439
00:23:06,945 --> 00:23:08,329
Scott: Let's start to build a plot

440
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:08,570
Scott: here.".

441
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:11,349
Scott: And he starts to build up this plot going on.

442
00:23:12,192 --> 00:23:15,030
Scott: And he just kept going with it and getting it bigger and bigger and bigger.

443
00:23:15,932 --> 00:23:18,470
Scott: And it rolled up into something kind of epic and awesome.

444
00:23:18,691 --> 00:23:25,290
Scott: And he managed to somehow continue to tell D&D jokes while also keeping the plot going.

445
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:27,810
Scott: While also having the strong characters.

446
00:23:29,172 --> 00:23:35,150
Scott: So then, in addition to the D&D jokes, it also has its own humor, just character humor.

447
00:23:36,612 --> 00:23:41,270
Scott: And I didn't realize how popular it was until he just kickstarted for like a zillion dollars.

448
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:47,130
Rym: Yeah, it's one of those things where you're not gonna see a lot of- like, people don't cosplay that much as it.

449
00:23:47,271 --> 00:23:51,350
Scott: I've never really- I've never seen or ordered this to cosplay in my life, but now I'm cosplaying Zykon.

450
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:55,270
Rym: I don't see mashups, you know, it's one of those things that's just solidly popular.

451
00:23:55,451 --> 00:23:59,190
Scott: Yeah, you never see, like, a thread in the forum about it or anything like that, right?

452
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:07,510
Scott: But- Rich Berlew never- he never did, like, the kind of publicity stuff- He would have long hiatuses where he wouldn't put out too many comics that frequently.

453
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,010
Scott: You know, I met him once, he was kinda shy, whatever.

454
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:15,450
Rym: Like, in the whole webcomic boom, he always felt very tangential to it.

455
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:18,950
Rym: Like, he was making a solid comic, but he wasn't involved in all the drama of the webcomic world.

456
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:26,930
Scott: He wasn't one of the major webcomics, like Penny Arcade and PVP and, you know, even the ones that people hate so much.

457
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:34,990
Scott: Like, Control Delete or, you know, Questionable Content or Aqua- you know, all the big- you know, Mega Tokyo, all the big webcomics.

458
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:39,330
Scott: The ones that come out swinging and, you know, the ones that people think of, good or bad, right?

459
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,540
Scott: He was just sorta like, "Successful webcomic.

460
00:24:42,002 --> 00:24:42,584
Scott: People read it.

461
00:24:42,604 --> 00:24:43,428
Scott: It's off to the

462
00:24:43,468 --> 00:24:43,810
Scott: side.".

463
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:50,730
Scott: You know, but it's not one that comes to mind when you talk- you know, if you're gonna do a documentary on webcomics, now you'd put him in there.

464
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:55,010
Scott: But if you were making this documentary, like, three years ago, maybe you wouldn't put him in there, you know?

465
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:58,570
Scott: You'd have to, like, go hunting around, maybe, or be really in the know.

466
00:24:59,011 --> 00:25:00,890
Scott: But I guess not, because I guess it's really popular.

467
00:25:02,491 --> 00:25:08,730
Scott: So, in addition to the webcomic that he did- he's still doing- he also, you know, printed the whole webcomic in books.

468
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:12,830
Scott: And he even printed up, like, whole books of stuff that isn't online.

469
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:19,790
Scott: Like, these prequel books, like, volume minus one, volume minus two, volume D. Like, they're not on the internets, as far as I know.

470
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:24,930
Scott: I mean, they might be pirated on the internets, but they're not, you know, on his website, you know, except for the purchase link.

471
00:25:25,632 --> 00:25:26,698
Scott: Which is a pretty interesting thing.

472
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,630
Scott: Like, if Penny Arcade did that, how awesome would that be?

473
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:32,950
Scott: Like, hey, he has, like, 50 Penny Arcade strips in a book that aren't on the internets.

474
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,442
Scott: I'd be like, "Oh my god, pre-order all the

475
00:25:35,482 --> 00:25:36,607
Scott: copies!".

476
00:25:38,674 --> 00:25:39,216
Scott: Anyway.

477
00:25:39,336 --> 00:25:42,930
Scott: So yeah, so he Kickstarted, because, you know, he didn't really have that much money from this, I guess.

478
00:25:44,233 --> 00:25:46,830
Scott: You know, other than the book sales, you know, which I think were steady.

479
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:51,750
Scott: But he sort of sold out of all the books, and he wanted to keep them all in print, so that anyone who wanted one could get them.

480
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:52,950
Scott: Because only a few of them were in print.

481
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:59,070
Scott: So he put the Kickstarter out there, and somehow the Kickstarter *usploded* a bajillion dollars.

482
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:03,280
Rym: Now, it's very telling that this is a comic that grew out of, basically, making fun of D&D.

483
00:26:08,571 --> 00:26:12,530
Scott: Yeah, it's like, D&D jokes only get you so far.

484
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:16,790
Scott: It's like, how many times can you tell the same joke about, you know, saving throws or Mage Hand?

485
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:22,210
Rym: But the fact that those jokes are still there, in this plot, I still enjoy it.

486
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:25,890
Rym: And I know a lot of people who never played a lot of D&D who found this comic hilarious.

487
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:35,850
Scott: Well, he does a good job of making the jokes still be D&D roleplaying jokes, without having them to be so specific to any particular rule system that you won't get them, right?

488
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:41,990
Scott: So it's like, you can still get them even if you just understand the general idea of D&D, and sort of like the basics.

489
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:43,270
Scott: You know?

490
00:26:43,551 --> 00:26:51,910
Scott: That, hey, bard sings songs, and, you know, when a bard sings a song, it has a magical power that influences people and helps them.

491
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,332
Scott: You know, gives them boosts.

492
00:26:53,393 --> 00:27:00,310
Scott: You don't need to know the specific rule that, like, bard's song gives +1 to your skill roll, whatever it is.

493
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:01,690
Scott: Anyway.

494
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:05,889
Rym: So, uh, I mean, what else, what can I say, really?

495
00:27:07,371 --> 00:27:10,505
Scott: Uh, I guess we can talk about some of the awesome stuff that's in it.

496
00:27:10,827 --> 00:27:11,389
Scott: Particulars.

497
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:13,069
Rym: Well, you just want to talk about Zykon.

498
00:27:13,553 --> 00:27:14,889
Scott: Uh, I was about to talk about Zykon.

499
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,389
Scott: Yeah, but we'll try to- Let's talk about someone besides Zykon.

500
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,230
Rym: We'll try to not spoil a lot, because, really, you should read this.

501
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:23,060
Rym: If you're at all into comics, forget webcomics.

502
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,670
Rym: This is just a comic that happens to be on the web.

503
00:27:28,677 --> 00:27:31,450
Scott: Uh, let's see, what part of this deck can we talk about?

504
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:32,919
Rym: I guess we could spoil.

505
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,250
Rym: Go past the spoiler line.

506
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:35,411
Scott: I don't know.

507
00:27:35,611 --> 00:27:36,012
Scott: Whatever.

508
00:27:36,092 --> 00:27:44,490
Scott: So, the basic idea is that, you know, at least the characters believe, and the reader believes, there's some sort of impending doom, right, against the world.

509
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:52,130
Scott: That in the olden days, the really strong magic dudes, sort of, you know, there was a horrible monster that sort of ruined, you know, that was going to destroy the whole world.

510
00:27:52,751 --> 00:27:59,230
Scott: And the, uh, the really powerful historical dudes from the way past managed to seal it up, right?

511
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:06,490
Scott: And they're like, for these, they're like these gates into the other dimension that it could come through, but the gates are sealed, so the world is safe, right?

512
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:27,750
Scott: But, that first dungeon they were in, in the whole story, and also some of the subsequent places, were at these gates, and, you know, Zykon and whoever wants these items of power, because everyone has different beliefs about exactly what the deal is, like, you know, some horrible spell you can cast at the gate to get powerful, or do evil, or whatever, or maybe do good.

513
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:31,697
Scott: So, it's like the good guys want to keep the gates sealed, and the bad guys want to open it.

514
00:28:31,717 --> 00:28:37,909
Scott: It's actually kind of similar to Golden Sun, where like the towers, where at first it's like the good guys are like, "No, we can't let the bad guys fuck with the

515
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:38,250
Scott: towers.".

516
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:41,785
Scott: And then it's like, "Alright, let's just go fuck with all the towers now, and see what

517
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:42,066
Scott: happens.".

518
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,634
Scott: Yeah.

519
00:28:44,674 --> 00:28:49,084
Scott: But, you know, they don't want to let, you know, the evil thing get in and destroy the whole world.

520
00:28:49,124 --> 00:28:51,630
Scott: They want to keep, you know, the thing sealed out and whatever.

521
00:28:51,870 --> 00:29:02,107
Scott: And in the course of doing this, they travel all over the world, and characters sort out their personal dramas, and you discover all sorts of, you know, "Oh, that was really that!

522
00:29:02,328 --> 00:29:02,488
Scott: Oh,

523
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:03,129
Scott: snap!".

524
00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:03,830
Rym: kind of stuff.

525
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:07,200
Rym: Well, I think what really what I like about the comic is that, one, it's clever.

526
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,630
Rym: Like, it's cleverly written, the writing's good, the dialogue's good, the characters are good.

527
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:24,970
Rym: But specifically, the characters are very deeply fleshed out, and actually react in interesting enough ways to where I'll actually put up with similar jokes being repeated, just because the characters themselves are kind of existing in this space and progressing through their shit.

528
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:27,235
Scott: Yeah, it has that strong character thing I like.

529
00:29:27,255 --> 00:29:32,969
Scott: You know, like a lot of animes and stuff, or, you know, like superhero comics, it's like, "Okay, you have this guy, and who is

530
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:33,089
Scott: he?".

531
00:29:33,733 --> 00:29:35,085
Scott: We talked about this a lot in DC 52, right?

532
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:36,754
Rym: Yeah, like Legion of Superheroes.

533
00:29:36,815 --> 00:29:38,160
Rym: They're just a bunch of stereotypes.

534
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,857
Scott: Well, there were two guys that weren't stereotypes.

535
00:29:40,897 --> 00:29:44,550
Scott: The really smart guy, the brainiac guy, and then the other guy, right?

536
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:49,167
Scott: And everyone else was just a costume that said something, and didn't have any character to them.

537
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:50,030
Scott: They didn't have a personality.

538
00:29:50,572 --> 00:29:56,010
Scott: All the order to stick characters, even side characters, and villains, and all kinds, they all have personalities.

539
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:05,710
Scott: And the thing is, he's not afraid to change the personalities either, and the thing is, he doesn't so much change them, but he has this clever- Evolve them.

540
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,994
Scott: Right, he'll evolve them or reveal them.

541
00:30:08,054 --> 00:30:11,040
Scott: It's like, "Okay, this guy hasn't really had a personality.

542
00:30:11,681 --> 00:30:15,849
Scott: Let's do a reveal, like, oh, he's actually been up to something this whole

543
00:30:15,929 --> 00:30:16,470
Scott: time!".

544
00:30:16,911 --> 00:30:25,110
Scott: So now you can retroactively apply that personality so it all makes sense, as opposed to the character didn't suddenly, you know, change their mind.

545
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:34,010
Scott: It's just, they were acting that way because, and now they're acting, you know, and now since they're revealed to the reader, you know, now you get to see them acting the way they really act.

546
00:30:34,551 --> 00:30:37,761
Scott: And the character has suddenly changed, even though plot-wise they didn't change.

547
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,590
Scott: You're just being able to see the character, whereas before it was hidden.

548
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:57,989
Rym: Now the final thing that really, I think, draws me to the comic is that, and I don't know if it's a side effect of Berloo's storytelling, or just a side effect of the fact that this is a story built in a world that follows Dungeons & Dragons rules directly, and specifically, and explicitly, but-

549
00:30:59,034 --> 00:30:59,949
Scott: We didn't do things of the day.

550
00:31:00,332 --> 00:31:01,489
Rym: Yeah, we did.

551
00:31:01,895 --> 00:31:02,208
Scott: I didn't.

552
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,318
Rym: Oh, I guess you didn't.

553
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,289
Rym: Oh well, you missed it.

554
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:04,761
Scott: Oh well.

555
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:11,369
Scott: So- I'm sitting here looking at my thing of the day and I'm like, I didn't talk about this.

556
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:24,419
Scott: Okay, so this thing of the day is actually, is actually a really good thing of the day.

557
00:31:25,741 --> 00:31:29,619
Scott: So it's a shame if I would have had to skip it, but I guess we'll just throw it in here for LOLs.

558
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,433
Scott: So, Where the Wild Things Are, it's a book.

559
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:33,540
Scott: It's a good book.

560
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,157
Rym: Great book.

561
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:34,678
Rym: Good.

562
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,880
Rym: There's an animated version.

563
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,440
Scott: Yep, there's a live action movie, which I haven't seen.

564
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,539
Rym: Yeah, I heard it was good.

565
00:31:39,782 --> 00:31:40,075
Scott: I don't know.

566
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:44,055
Scott: But anyway, here is on YouTube a reading of the book.

567
00:31:44,075 --> 00:31:45,440
Scott: It's about 10 minutes long.

568
00:31:46,183 --> 00:31:48,680
Scott: It is read by Christopher Walken.

569
00:31:49,321 --> 00:31:53,760
Scott: And because it's a short book, he sort of has to elaborate and he describes all the pictures and all kinds of stuff.

570
00:31:54,923 --> 00:31:58,440
Scott: And while he's reading it, of course the YouTube video is showing you the pages.

571
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,511
Scott: And that's about it.

572
00:32:02,256 --> 00:32:02,980
Scott: It's the awesomest.

573
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:03,860
Rym: You don't want to say?

574
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,310
Scott: It's Christopher Walken reading.

575
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:06,639
Scott: The Wild Things Are.

576
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,120
Rym: Christopher Walken.

577
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,119
Scott: There's not really much else into it.

578
00:32:11,122 --> 00:32:12,279
Scott: That's all you need.

579
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:15,680
Scott: And he keeps calling Max a jerk.

580
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,266
Scott: He's like,

581
00:32:16,306 --> 00:32:16,530
Scott: "What?".

582
00:32:17,841 --> 00:32:18,905
Scott: And he's like, "What's he doing?

583
00:32:19,006 --> 00:32:21,397
Scott: beating that beast over the head with his king

584
00:32:21,437 --> 00:32:21,678
Scott: stick?".

585
00:32:22,829 --> 00:32:23,020
Scott: Anyway.

586
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:38,420
Rym: So anyway, but because the world is so kind of deeply entwined in these very specific rules, the writing is such that every tiny little detail is perfectly cross-referenced with every other detail.

587
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:42,120
Rym: Superhero Comics has got nothing on the continuity of the Order of the Stick.

588
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:42,826
Scott: Yeah, it does.

589
00:32:42,846 --> 00:32:43,960
Scott: It has extreme continuity.

590
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,860
Scott: And the thing is, it's not just character continuity.

591
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,548
Rym: External continuity.

592
00:32:47,589 --> 00:32:48,580
Rym: He'll mention a spell.

593
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:54,000
Rym: And you bet that if you look, the characters are the right level based on everything going on.

594
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,100
Rym: And the thing is, he's got so many aspects, right?

595
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,568
Scott: The political realm is covered.

596
00:32:58,829 --> 00:33:00,555
Scott: He's got the fantasy history.

597
00:33:00,956 --> 00:33:02,100
Scott: The lore is covered.

598
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:07,140
Scott: He's even got shit with the kind of weird breaking the fourth wall shit.

599
00:33:08,646 --> 00:33:09,640
Rym: Summon plot element.

600
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:15,839
Scott: Right, the girlfriend who's a fairy from another plane who comes with the lawyers ends up being legit.

601
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:23,080
Scott: Even the cockroaches, which are sort of like the old guys of The Muppet Show, are actually part of the plot for reals.

602
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:32,620
Scott: And it's like every little thing, even stuff that seems like it's only there for jokes or props or whatever, is actually for reals and it counts and it's always there.

603
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:34,466
Rym: There is a thing that happens.

604
00:33:34,506 --> 00:33:36,834
Rym: Remember, there's a girdle of gender changing that they find.

605
00:33:38,901 --> 00:33:41,079
Scott: I bet someone's wearing it right now and you don't even know.

606
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:47,900
Rym: In the first ten strips and it comes back way later than you'd expect out of nowhere.

607
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:53,637
Scott: But the thing is, if you've read the whole comic, when it comes out you're just like, "Oh yeah, the girdle of gender

608
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:53,879
Scott: changes.".

609
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,320
Rym: The best way I'd put it, in a Guy Ritchie movie, the number of bullets that people fire matters.

610
00:34:00,442 --> 00:34:04,820
Rym: In the order of the stick, the number of seventh level spells that someone casts matters.

611
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,275
Rym: And it's weird.

612
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,610
Scott: It's like some guy would be like, "Oh, I didn't memorize that today.

613
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,058
Scott: I actually used all my spells

614
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:11,380
Scott: already.".

615
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,139
Scott: And if you go back and check, yeah he did.

616
00:34:14,902 --> 00:34:19,800
Rym: And it's weird because I don't like that sort of thing in certain kinds of stories.

617
00:34:20,161 --> 00:34:26,920
Rym: But I think it's because this is a story that's also kind of making light of Dungeons and Dragons and fitting inside of these rules.

618
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,340
Rym: Like characters living in a world where they know the rules of the world.

619
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:35,139
Scott: Yeah, and the thing is because you've been in that world with those rules, you can really identify with them.

620
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:38,137
Scott: When they're sitting there being like, "How do we tell this person about this horrible thing that

621
00:34:38,157 --> 00:34:38,418
Scott: happened?".

622
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:43,980
Scott: Well, you can't use sending because that doesn't work because then I need to have something that belongs to them or some shit.

623
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,250
Scott: Do you have anything?

624
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,239
Scott: I don't know.

625
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:50,280
Scott: It's that same problem solving, the same exact discussions.

626
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,250
Rym: Alright, I can only send 25 words.

627
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,577
Rym: Well, I can cast it three times.

628
00:34:53,757 --> 00:34:54,018
Scott: Let's go.

629
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,658
Scott: These are the same discussions that you have out of character when you're playing D&D.

630
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:03,120
Scott: Only these are the characters having them in character, but they're the exact same discussion.

631
00:35:04,382 --> 00:35:05,370
Scott: And it's like, "Oh my god, that's

632
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:05,813
Scott: awesome.".

633
00:35:07,662 --> 00:35:08,366
Rym: It's a great comic.

634
00:35:08,386 --> 00:35:08,949
Rym: You should read it.

635
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:10,840
Rym: It's all online free.

636
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,607
Scott: Even if you don't like D&D.

637
00:35:12,648 --> 00:35:14,660
Scott: Well, not all online except for the volumes that aren't online.

638
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,222
Rym: Except for those.

639
00:35:15,262 --> 00:35:20,060
Rym: But the main story, you don't need to read Superman, Special Edition, and X Factor.

640
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,340
Scott: No, not at all.

641
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,116
Rym: But it's all online and the art is simple.

642
00:35:24,177 --> 00:35:24,560
Rym: It sticks.

643
00:35:26,043 --> 00:35:27,110
Scott: It's not just sticks.

644
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,580
Scott: It's squares and circles and triangles.

645
00:35:29,201 --> 00:35:31,778
Rym: The art really serves the kind of story that it is.

646
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:37,420
Rym: And two, despite its simplicity, it actually gets noticeably better as the story goes on.

647
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:43,220
Scott: Yeah, you can actually see even though it's still the same character designs, the same circles and sticks, he gets better at it.

648
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,027
Scott: He adds in the shading and the coloring.

649
00:35:45,569 --> 00:35:48,240
Scott: The actual graphical quality improves.

650
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:53,237
Scott: And in fact, he does a lot of stuff that's sort of artistically experimental.

651
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,740
Scott: Like there's the crayon comics and stuff like that.

652
00:35:58,743 --> 00:36:03,540
Scott: So it's not just some poorly done sprite crapo stick comic.

653
00:36:03,821 --> 00:36:05,368
Scott: It's actually good.

654
00:36:05,388 --> 00:36:08,060
Scott: The same way the XKCD is good, despite it just being sticks.

655
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,598
Rym: Now what's interesting is, for me personally, we found this comic right away.

656
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,884
Rym: I don't even know.

657
00:36:12,945 --> 00:36:13,708
Rym: It tells how old I am.

658
00:36:13,769 --> 00:36:16,020
Rym: I do not remember how I found it.

659
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,219
Scott: Pretty sure someone else found it and just told us to read it.

660
00:36:18,501 --> 00:36:20,069
Rym: I don't know how I found Penny Arcade.

661
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:22,100
Rym: I couldn't tell you how I found real life.

662
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,999
Rym: I found Megatokyo because Slashdot linked to it.

663
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,446
Scott: That is correct.

664
00:36:26,467 --> 00:36:27,840
Scott: I found Megatokyo because Slashdot linked to it.

665
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,360
Rym: And then we all read Megatokyo religiously and talked about it after every update for a while.

666
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,618
Scott: Even though it really made no sense.

667
00:36:34,162 --> 00:36:36,960
Rym: That was the early days of webcomics being a big thing.

668
00:36:37,422 --> 00:36:41,970
Rym: But we found Order of the Stick and I know we found it right away because I remember thinking, "Hey, this is pretty

669
00:36:42,011 --> 00:36:42,235
Rym: good.".

670
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:46,880
Rym: And I hit back to the beginning and there were only like eight or nine strips.

671
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,894
Rym: And then I was up to the current time.

672
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,100
Scott: I definitely started reading it while they were in that first dungeon.

673
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,819
Scott: So I've been reading it for a long time, which means I'm better than you.

674
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:04,600
Rym: But I remember there was a time like a year and a half ago, where for whatever reason I kind of stopped reading all my webcomics.

675
00:37:05,165 --> 00:37:05,557
Rym: All of them?

676
00:37:05,883 --> 00:37:07,480
Rym: As in the only ones I was still reading.

677
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,700
Scott: I wake up and read them every morning.

678
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,300
Rym: It was Penny Arcade and, you know, like the super car.

679
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,554
Rym: And I kind of forgot about Order of the Stick and Dr.

680
00:37:14,594 --> 00:37:15,380
Rym: McNinja for a while.

681
00:37:15,902 --> 00:37:16,689
Scott: Whoa, if I forget about Dr.

682
00:37:16,709 --> 00:37:17,719
Scott: McNinja, what the fuck?

683
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,293
Rym: And then I corrected the Dr.

684
00:37:19,334 --> 00:37:19,940
Rym: McNinja problem.

685
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,776
Rym: Like one day I was like, "Oh shit, Dr.

686
00:37:21,796 --> 00:37:22,200
Rym: McNinja!".

687
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,620
Rym: And I read all the strips I'd missed.

688
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,557
Rym: So like four months ago, I was like, "Oh right, Order of the

689
00:37:27,618 --> 00:37:27,960
Rym: Stick!".

690
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:32,200
Rym: And I went back and until I found the point where I'd stopped reading.

691
00:37:32,963 --> 00:37:34,239
Rym: And I just started reading again.

692
00:37:34,321 --> 00:37:35,819
Rym: And the next thing I knew, I was all caught up.

693
00:37:36,341 --> 00:37:38,200
Rym: And that was like hitting a brick wall.

694
00:37:39,561 --> 00:37:41,533
Rym: Now like every morning I check, like, "Did he update?

695
00:37:41,674 --> 00:37:42,257
Rym: Did he update?

696
00:37:42,277 --> 00:37:42,318
Rym: Oh

697
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:42,720
Rym: shit!".

698
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,859
Scott: He's been updating more now that he doesn't need to worry about monies.

699
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:48,000
Rym: Yeah, also the plots pick it up in a big way.

700
00:37:48,361 --> 00:37:50,160
Scott: Oh yeah, something exciting is going to happen real soon.

701
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:50,939
Rym: Yes, Icon!

702
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,920
Scott: So it's a good time to get on this ball, right?

703
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,120
Scott: While the, you know, the rising tide.

704
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:03,659
Rym: Yep, and unlike some webcomics where maybe you don't want to go back to the very beginning and read, this is one where you do.

705
00:38:03,944 --> 00:38:04,660
Scott: Yeah, you definitely do.

706
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,960
Rym: If you haven't read it, just literally start at number one and go.

707
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,800
Rym: There's no reason to skip the beginning, it's great.

708
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,420
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

709
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:23,540
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

710
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,940
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

711
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,880
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

712
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:36,620
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

713
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:40,136
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

714
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:44,400
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

715
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,560
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
