00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,547
Rym: It's Wednesday, October 24th, 2012.

2
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:13,877
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,364 --> 00:00:14,857
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,460
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight, the sixth One Piece movie.

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,878
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:27,260
Rym: So we were going to watch the first One Piece movie, and I downloaded it.

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,240
Rym: In fact, I downloaded a torrent that was every One Piece movie, up to like nine.

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:31,809
Rym: Whoa.

9
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:34,840
Rym: With Arabic and Italian subtitles only.

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,300
Scott: Well, we know it's very popular in Italy.

11
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,479
Scott: They have that great One Piece opener.

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:37,873
Scott: Yeah.

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:44,760
Rym: The thing is, the opener that stuck in my head is the American opener, because of that panel I always wrote.

14
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,439
Rym: Did you- One Piece.

15
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,220
Rym: It's the name of the treasure on the grand line.

16
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,278
Scott: Did you not look at the notes on the torrent and see that- Yeah, so you know what?

17
00:00:54,561 --> 00:00:56,660
Rym: Most of these torrents had fuck all for notes.

18
00:00:56,822 --> 00:00:57,500
Scott: Were you on Pirate Bay?

19
00:00:57,946 --> 00:00:58,179
Rym: Yeah.

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,000
Scott: Maybe you should go see for anime, sometimes you gotta go to the other site with like Baka BT or whatever.

21
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:03,838
Scott: I don't even know what it is.

22
00:01:04,181 --> 00:01:08,216
Rym: I looked around and most of them had all the recent One Piece movies, but not the first one.

23
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,139
Rym: So I had another torrent, so I figured, you know, one of the two would be good.

24
00:01:11,867 --> 00:01:12,037
Rym: Nope.

25
00:01:12,641 --> 00:01:13,799
Rym: Also, only Italian.

26
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,839
Scott: I have a feeling you didn't read something.

27
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:21,270
Scott: Usually I notice it says on torrents, like, "This has Italian Dutch subtitles, this is Italian

28
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:21,680
Scott: subtitles.".

29
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:25,370
Rym: One of them had comments that were only in Italian, and I kind of thought, "Well, this one might not be

30
00:01:25,391 --> 00:01:25,533
Rym: good.".

31
00:01:26,008 --> 00:01:26,080
Rym: Gee.

32
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,436
Scott: But that was my back- I wonder.

33
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,659
Rym: That one was my backup torrent.

34
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:30,488
Scott: Right.

35
00:01:31,063 --> 00:01:32,797
Rym: So this morning I'm like,

36
00:01:32,837 --> 00:01:33,079
Rym: "Fuck.".

37
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,540
Rym: So I'd search for like every torrent, I'd start them all, because whatever, I got Fios.

38
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,280
Rym: And not only was not a single torrent in English, but one of them was in Hebrew.

39
00:01:42,904 --> 00:01:43,078
Scott: Okay.

40
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:49,178
Rym: So all the other One Piece movies are really easy to get, so we watched the sixth One Piece movie.

41
00:01:49,848 --> 00:01:50,117
Scott: Uh-huh.

42
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:53,380
Rym: We'll get to that in a little bit, but first we got some news, because it's Wednesday.

43
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,460
Scott: All right, so check this out.

44
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:54,980
Rym: I'm checking.

45
00:01:56,322 --> 00:01:59,000
Scott: You know, Katie Cook wrote this pony comic.

46
00:01:59,485 --> 00:02:00,880
Scott: I forgot, who's the guy who drew it?

47
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:01,540
Scott: Oh my god.

48
00:02:01,761 --> 00:02:02,379
Rym: I don't remember.

49
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,187
Scott: And everyone keeps getting it confused.

50
00:02:04,267 --> 00:02:09,639
Scott: anyway, sorry artist dude, because Katie Cook has been known as an artist, right?

51
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,140
Scott: You know, of many things.

52
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,399
Scott: And she's very, very good.

53
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:19,839
Scott: So when she suddenly writes a comic, everyone's like thinking she's drawing it without even, you know, noticing.

54
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,457
Scott: But anyway, the pony comic.

55
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,780
Scott: The pre-sales for it, I guess.

56
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,517
Rym: Of course, we're talking about My Little Pony, Friendship is Magic, you know, G4.

57
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:29,820
Scott: Yeah, issue number one from IDW, right?

58
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,300
Scott: The sales were over 90,000.

59
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,260
Scott: So wait, wait, wait, wait.

60
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,800
Scott: And you might be saying 90,000 copies.

61
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:47,620
Rym: So correct me if I'm wrong, but is not My Little Pony now, the new comic, before it's even available for real, outselling X-Men?

62
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:50,440
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's kind of weird, right?

63
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:57,720
Scott: Back in the olden days, the number one selling comic book would be millions of copies, like action comics, you know, in the olden days, golden age.

64
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,420
Rym: You know, before everything we talk about on GeekNights.

65
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:11,078
Scott: Nowadays, if you sell 100,000 copies, you are pretty much the most popular comic there is because the only nerds buy those little, you know, buy floppy comic books in comic book stores and no one else.

66
00:03:11,582 --> 00:03:16,420
Scott: And the number that they quote you is the number that comic book stores buy, not the number that comic book stores sell.

67
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,919
Scott: So a lot of times, you know, the best selling comic doesn't actually sell as well as you think it does.

68
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,320
Scott: Because comic book stores load up on it and then no one buys.

69
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,640
Rym: Or if they don't, maybe every comic book store only buys one.

70
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:30,958
Rym: That's still a lot of comics.

71
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,400
Scott: Well, no, that's that's a few thousand.

72
00:03:33,841 --> 00:03:35,900
Rym: Yeah, there's more than a few thousand comic book stores.

73
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,080
Scott: There's so few comic book stores, you have no idea.

74
00:03:38,281 --> 00:03:39,080
Scott: It's like a couple thousand.

75
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:39,760
Rym: Maybe three.

76
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,600
Rym: Well, I'll try to find out how many comic book stores there are in America.

77
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,099
Scott: It is only a few thousand, it is kind of sad.

78
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:47,799
Scott: It's a really sad number when you find it anyway.

79
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,039
Rym: But yet somehow there's that one in Newberg.

80
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:53,220
Scott: If that one even counts anyway.

81
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,540
Rym: There's the one in the hippie mall.

82
00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:02,720
Scott: So the thing is, you know, something that, you know, they love to do with comics to make more money is they make multiple covers.

83
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:05,252
Scott: And the My Little Pony, Friendship is Magic.

84
00:04:05,332 --> 00:04:06,740
Scott: issue number one is no exception.

85
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,560
Scott: There's a there's a like two or three covers to choose from.

86
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:15,319
Scott: And then there's like limited variant covers and then there's like a box set that has all the covers.

87
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:17,779
Scott: And then there's an even more limited cover and it's crazy.

88
00:04:19,983 --> 00:04:32,080
Scott: Uh, so I actually did something I never do and bought all the covers, one of everything because I'll read the regular one and flip the rest of them on eBay to crazy pony people who don't know how to order comic books properly.

89
00:04:32,641 --> 00:04:36,700
Rym: Even if they know how to order comic books, maybe they didn't think to preorder like this one.

90
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,400
Rym: They figured whatever.

91
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,420
Rym: No one's going to buy my little pony.

92
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,779
Scott: They're going to go into the comic book store asking for it and they're only going to have the regular cover or it'll be sold out.

93
00:04:44,182 --> 00:04:45,699
Scott: Meanwhile, I'll have a full set.

94
00:04:46,641 --> 00:04:52,256
Rym: So I found one number that said a little over twelve thousand comic book stores in the United States.

95
00:04:53,081 --> 00:05:05,199
Rym: I found another number that said thousands and I found a link to a diamond distributors site that claims to have the answer, but doesn't actually become like if you go to the comic shop locator and you just go to every type in every zip code.

96
00:05:05,603 --> 00:05:06,000
Rym: Yeah.

97
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:07,592
Scott: I'm going to get on that right now.

98
00:05:08,661 --> 00:05:10,548
Scott: We have a database.

99
00:05:10,749 --> 00:05:13,660
Scott: one comic shop locator is a database of every comic shop.

100
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,000
Scott: So if you go through it, you could count anyway.

101
00:05:16,341 --> 00:05:18,340
Rym: Now the question is, how many people use that site?

102
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:23,833
Rym: And if I wrote a W get script that was going to hit it all night, how long before it shuts down?

103
00:05:24,422 --> 00:05:27,180
Scott: So incompetent you could easily get the data anyway.

104
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,460
Scott: No, I'm worried that I'm going to bring it down that many.

105
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,818
Scott: So here's is something interesting, right?

106
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,439
Scott: Is that I got the preorder form that includes my little pony number two.

107
00:05:38,303 --> 00:05:40,099
Scott: And there were three different covers this time.

108
00:05:41,162 --> 00:05:42,880
Scott: Cover number one was the regular cover.

109
00:05:43,002 --> 00:05:43,718
Scott: So I ordered that one.

110
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:46,720
Rym: Yeah, it is actually selling better than Uncanny X-Men, right?

111
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:59,179
Scott: Cover number two was a one in, I think, 50 or 25 variant, which means that if you're a comic book store and you order 25 copies of My Little Pony, one of them will have this different cover.

112
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,157
Scott: So if you want two of this different cover, you have to order 50 copies.

113
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,520
Rym: We've talked about why I think the way we distribute comics in this country is ridiculous.

114
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,805
Rym: So we don't need to say anything about.

115
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:11,660
Scott: there was a third cover on issue number two that was even more rare.

116
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,351
Scott: I think it was like one in 50 or one in 100. get this cover.

117
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,588
Scott: So I was like, oh, might as well buy these and flip them on eBay just like issue number one.

118
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:20,579
Scott: Crazy pony fan.

119
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,432
Rym: Well, you know, somehow I'm translating you saying that into.

120
00:06:23,794 --> 00:06:26,819
Rym: might as well put them in Lucite and hang them up on my wall.

121
00:06:27,281 --> 00:06:27,563
Scott: Right.

122
00:06:28,086 --> 00:06:30,200
Scott: So they were selling this.

123
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:39,280
Scott: Keep in mind, this is a discount preorder for smart people who know what's up that extra rare cocoa bean My Little Pony number two cover.

124
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:41,180
Scott: That was these rare variant.

125
00:06:41,581 --> 00:06:42,344
Scott: They were selling.

126
00:06:42,464 --> 00:06:47,340
Scott: I would have had to pay out of my pocket one hundred dollars.

127
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:47,861
Rym: What?

128
00:06:48,384 --> 00:06:50,959
Scott: Fuck that up the ass.

129
00:06:51,221 --> 00:06:53,311
Scott: Even though I flipped that on eBay, I wouldn't make shit.

130
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:56,005
Scott: who's going to pay more than a hundred bucks?

131
00:06:56,528 --> 00:06:58,520
Rym: May how many are being printed?

132
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,000
Scott: Because there's ninety thousand.

133
00:07:01,623 --> 00:07:03,980
Rym: If that comic is a rarity.

134
00:07:04,601 --> 00:07:04,862
Scott: Right.

135
00:07:05,786 --> 00:07:09,080
Scott: If let's say that let's give it a nice because issue two always is a big drop.

136
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:09,404
Scott: Right.

137
00:07:09,424 --> 00:07:10,600
Scott: So let's say seventy five.

138
00:07:10,943 --> 00:07:12,480
Rym: Now, some things have a big drop.

139
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,860
Scott: But remember, issue two being my job, conservative estimate ponies goes up.

140
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,820
Scott: Hundred thousand copies is number one.

141
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:19,303
Scott: Right.

142
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:21,220
Scott: One in a hundred.

143
00:07:21,762 --> 00:07:24,099
Scott: So there's only a thousand of these in the whole earth.

144
00:07:24,301 --> 00:07:25,899
Scott: There's a lot more than a thousand pony fans.

145
00:07:26,324 --> 00:07:27,357
Scott: I'm not paying a hundred bucks.

146
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,060
Scott: I'm not going to find a thousand pony fans willing to shop more than a hundred bucks.

147
00:07:32,602 --> 00:07:50,639
Rym: I have this feeling that other than people who listen to GeekNights and people who are already fans of My Little Pony and are hardcore enough about it to follow pony news at a time, even at a time like this, when ponies is so far from actually having been on the air with new episodes.

148
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:59,726
Rym: I have a feeling that the geekery of the world is going to discover that the My Little Pony comic is selling really big and that's going to cause another wave of what the fuck bronies.

149
00:08:00,475 --> 00:08:00,840
Scott: We'll see.

150
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,380
Scott: Anyway, it's the point is, is comics probably going to be worth reading.

151
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:08,800
Scott: There's some free previews online, a little bit, a few pages or so.

152
00:08:09,061 --> 00:08:10,005
Rym: Pretty excited about it.

153
00:08:10,286 --> 00:08:13,357
Rym: And I'm more excited about this than the last 52 comics.

154
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,160
Scott: Katie Cook is an awesome brony type person.

155
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,199
Scott: So I, you know, I trust her to know what's going on.

156
00:08:22,381 --> 00:08:27,584
Scott: So if you want to read this comic, you should a) someone's going to scan it in on the Internet.

157
00:08:27,665 --> 00:08:28,479
Scott: You know, that's going to happen.

158
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:36,140
Scott: B) Get the trade, which will come out and you just buy it on Amazon, no problem, super cheap and will not be collectible or expensive in any way.

159
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:44,939
Rym: I wonder if when that's on Amazon, that'll be about six months from now, the bronies will do what happens with Firefly and everything else where they just keep buying extra copies of it and sits in the number one for a while.

160
00:08:45,641 --> 00:08:47,099
Scott: And it'll be six months from now.

161
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,307
Rym: That would be an interesting measure.

162
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,420
Rym: But I don't even know.

163
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,839
Rym: I do know this is all expected.

164
00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:07,919
Rym: Yeah, but anyway, things of the day, you might remember quite some time ago we interviewed the Oda King on our show.

165
00:09:08,563 --> 00:09:11,720
Rym: He was talking about translation and how fansubbers are dumbasses.

166
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:13,340
Rym: And it was a great interview.

167
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,108
Rym: He's a great guy.

168
00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:15,160
Rym: He's done cool stuff.

169
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:19,705
Rym: There are many things he has done and many of you might be familiar with him, but I don't need to get into that.

170
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:21,539
Rym: He did yet another thing.

171
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:27,436
Rym: And it's interesting because a lot of the people I know who saw this didn't know it was him who did it.

172
00:09:27,761 --> 00:09:30,100
Scott: Neither did I until someone pointed it out and I said, wait.

173
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:35,380
Rym: But when they watched it, said something like, hey, this is kind of like what the Oda King did before.

174
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,560
Scott: It looks like his style.

175
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,618
Rym: Yeah, because it is him.

176
00:09:38,501 --> 00:09:53,559
Rym: All I have to say is that if there was a thing that would make me more excited than Ghost in the Shell standalone complex third gig, because it doesn't exist, or My Little Pony, it would be a Star Wars anime that looked like this.

177
00:09:55,364 --> 00:09:56,177
Rym: I just watch it.

178
00:09:56,841 --> 00:10:02,519
Rym: And if you don't think this is one of the greatest things you've ever seen, you're either a terrible person or you're way too young.

179
00:10:04,301 --> 00:10:09,920
Scott: OK, so I saw a link to a funny video on YouTube and it was all about Halloween costumes.

180
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,700
Scott: It was a funny little cute animation.

181
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,780
Scott: And I noticed that it was part of this YouTube channel, Sleeping Ninja Toast.

182
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:24,479
Scott: So I check out the channel and it has many other hilarious and cute animations in it, mostly about Zelda and tongues.

183
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:35,897
Scott: Yeah, I highly suggest you watch obviously the Halloween costume animation that brought me into this, but also every video in this channel, especially my summed up experience in Twilight Princess.

184
00:10:39,022 --> 00:10:45,399
Rym: This is the kind of thing where it's really cute, but I feel like we're going to see the girl who's making this stuff like a couple of years from now.

185
00:10:45,821 --> 00:10:54,380
Scott: You can tell watching these videos that whoever is the person doing this is someone with talents who is going to bust out onto the scene.

186
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,440
Rym: I think very similar.

187
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,660
Rym: You know what this reminds me of the kid who did that Lavender Town expose.

188
00:10:59,741 --> 00:11:02,732
Scott: Like very well, I think it's a little better than that equal.

189
00:11:02,813 --> 00:11:07,060
Rym: equal in terms of what I project to be their potential for YouTube.

190
00:11:07,641 --> 00:11:10,940
Scott: This is this is a person who is young and has high talent and is productive.

191
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:25,780
Scott: And especially if you watch the video, there's a video where they demonstrate how to draw Zelda in flash like, you know, they drew a picture of regular Zelda, just, you know, like a rat, you know, just a pencil, scan it in and then draw vector Zelda on top of it.

192
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,160
Scott: You can tell this person knows what they're doing.

193
00:11:28,464 --> 00:11:40,040
Scott: I expect great things in the future to subscribe to this YouTube channel and you will see things possibly before they explode on the Internet and discover this person before they are super popular and famous.

194
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,799
Scott: I bet they're going to be busting out in artist's alleys and other places soon enough, if not already.

195
00:11:47,002 --> 00:11:58,680
Rym: So in the meta moment, very briefly, before we get into this, this amazing burning, burning con is this this this weekend, also including what you got to get a stutter stutter, stutter looting Sunday.

196
00:11:59,241 --> 00:12:02,640
Rym: I'm running a game in the first slot on Saturday.

197
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,040
Scott: I'm running even the last slot on Sunday.

198
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,920
Scott: So basically, it's a lot mean Scott bookending the convention.

199
00:12:11,062 --> 00:12:12,239
Scott: I'm in the bed slot.

200
00:12:12,463 --> 00:12:13,280
Rym: I think it's a fine.

201
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,125
Scott: So it's a bad slide because everyone's already left and everyone's tired and no one gives a shit.

202
00:12:17,206 --> 00:12:18,300
Rym: I don't leave burning con.

203
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:20,220
Rym: I usually leave, though.

204
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,619
Scott: I don't leave, but other people do.

205
00:12:21,863 --> 00:12:22,600
Rym: I think you'll be fine.

206
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,390
Rym: We have enough.

207
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,180
Rym: Legend of Krauser.

208
00:12:24,361 --> 00:12:25,679
Rym: I think people will join our games.

209
00:12:25,981 --> 00:12:26,442
Scott: I hope so.

210
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:32,123
Rym: The thing is, I get to set the bar for every game everyone else plays and who starts with mine.

211
00:12:32,163 --> 00:12:37,586
Scott: I also think, you know, I look through a lot the game schedule and it's like careful.

212
00:12:37,606 --> 00:12:39,020
Rym: A lot of those people listen to gig nights.

213
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:39,904
Rym: What are you about to say?

214
00:12:39,985 --> 00:12:46,760
Scott: A lot of the games I want to play in are all at the same slots and not I want to play in inheritance.

215
00:12:47,824 --> 00:12:48,920
Scott: I already did inheritance.

216
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,627
Rym: It's changed it.

217
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:50,599
Rym: It's a larp now.

218
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:52,359
Scott: And that makes me want to do it less.

219
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,003
Rym: Really?

220
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:54,620
Scott: Already done that.

221
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,419
Scott: I want to do new stuff.

222
00:12:56,405 --> 00:12:57,500
Rym: You got a lot of opportunities.

223
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,598
Rym: How many slots are there?

224
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,090
Rym: Lots of five.

225
00:13:00,395 --> 00:13:00,660
Rym: Yeah.

226
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:07,000
Rym: Five Saturday to Sunday anime Boston a ways out Magfest.

227
00:13:07,482 --> 00:13:09,760
Rym: We're finalizing our schedule for what we're doing at Magfest.

228
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,539
Rym: But rest assured, we're going to be a fucking Magfest.

229
00:13:12,721 --> 00:13:13,219
Scott: Fuck yeah.

230
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,320
Rym: Paxis, the three day badges are sold out, as are all the good hotels.

231
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:16,995
Rym: We warned you.

232
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,699
Scott: Us badges are on sale now.

233
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:29,833
Rym: I'm going to buy my badge probably tonight, even in case really in case it's one sells out to somehow we don't get to lecture at it.

234
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:40,159
Rym: and three, wouldn't it be pretty great to have Australia finally get finally a pax and some American douchebag is one of the omega knots.

235
00:13:40,381 --> 00:13:41,679
Scott: Yeah, that's what you're going for.

236
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,776
Rym: That's what I'm going for.

237
00:13:43,432 --> 00:13:43,720
Scott: All right.

238
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:48,048
Rym: Maybe I'll buy one by two then by two that I'll have to buy three because Emily's coming to.

239
00:13:48,088 --> 00:13:48,720
Scott: what are we seeing?

240
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,120
Scott: How is there?

241
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:54,179
Rym: How do we sell them off if I don't know how we're going to manage that?

242
00:13:55,142 --> 00:13:57,180
Rym: I haven't done any planning for this trip yet.

243
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,079
Rym: All I know is it cost about two grand if we fly coach.

244
00:14:00,644 --> 00:14:01,099
Scott: That's cool.

245
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,278
Rym: It's not that bad.

246
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,520
Scott: The thing is, it's like one grand to fly to Seattle.

247
00:14:05,921 --> 00:14:07,277
Scott: So just two Seattle's.

248
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:12,979
Rym: If you fly a little bit off like we did, I was like 400 bucks to fly to Seattle.

249
00:14:13,963 --> 00:14:15,358
Scott: No, I mean, and back and back.

250
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,440
Rym: No, you bought your ticket after me.

251
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:23,660
Rym: My flight there was well, my flight back was nothing because we flew back Monday night.

252
00:14:23,942 --> 00:14:26,520
Scott: Yeah, it's like it's, you know, it's a few hundred dollars each way.

253
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,038
Scott: Comes out close, you know, give you between eight hundred and a thousand dollars for the round trip.

254
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:38,256
Rym: I've never paid more than six hundred dollars round trip to packs because you can get one of the flights for like one hundred and twenty bucks every time.

255
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,019
Scott: JetBlue, the direct flight.

256
00:14:41,523 --> 00:14:42,600
Rym: Yeah, just don't fly.

257
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,198
Rym: You got to fly at the right times.

258
00:14:45,064 --> 00:14:46,000
Scott: We fly in the same flight.

259
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:46,321
Rym: Yeah.

260
00:14:46,342 --> 00:14:47,600
Rym: And I always buy the tickets first.

261
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,040
Rym: Then I'm like, Scott, buy this flight.

262
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,698
Rym: Usually the cheap seats are sold out by then.

263
00:14:52,301 --> 00:14:53,939
Rym: Anyway, join the forum.

264
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,000
Rym: Check out our Internet shit.

265
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,339
Rym: We uploaded a radio for Equestria since ponies are coming up again.

266
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,879
Scott: Yeah, I'm going to send out a newsletter probably real soon.

267
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:06,999
Rym: Yeah, we're going to do more radio for Equestria and we're going to do another show because enough of you said you wanted us to do it.

268
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:11,799
Rym: We're going to do the RFE treatment on Shoujo Kakumei Utena.

269
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,960
Scott: Gotta watch it first.

270
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,837
Rym: We're going to watch it episode by episode and do a show on the show, dog.

271
00:15:18,321 --> 00:15:19,178
Rym: OK, so.

272
00:15:20,262 --> 00:15:22,800
Rym: We skipped one, two, three, four and five.

273
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,533
Rym: I've only seen, I don't know, seven episodes of the book.

274
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:31,194
Scott: club book is name of the wind, name of the wind by Patrick Rothfuss.

275
00:15:32,102 --> 00:15:32,890
Scott: So read that shit.

276
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:33,900
Rym: OK, just the first book.

277
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,399
Rym: I'm about a third of the way through.

278
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:43,399
Rym: And I just got to the point where the kids like, you know what, I'm going to stop being a dumb ass and I'm going to become a man now.

279
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,704
Scott: That's the good part.

280
00:15:44,805 --> 00:15:51,031
Rym: Also, so far, this plot is very similar to Elminster, The Making of a Mage, which is a fuck out of the realm's book.

281
00:15:51,292 --> 00:15:53,167
Rym: that takes you through the life of Elminster.

282
00:15:53,512 --> 00:15:54,019
Rym: And you know what?

283
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,040
Rym: Elminster also became a poor street urchin thief.

284
00:15:58,925 --> 00:15:59,960
Rym: The parallels are astounding.

285
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,040
Scott: Are you saying it's a rip off?

286
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,940
Rym: I'm not sure because Elminster, Making of a Mage is a pretty awful book.

287
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,059
Rym: So tell me this.

288
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,078
Rym: I can ask you one thing.

289
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:18,635
Rym: Does the main character in our book club book, The Name of the Wind, become a girl and have an elf have sex with him and learn magic better?

290
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:20,208
Rym: because women are better at magic than men?

291
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:20,738
Scott: Not yet.

292
00:16:23,062 --> 00:16:25,399
Rym: OK, if that happens, this book is a rip off.

293
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:32,260
Rym: OK, so we I've seen maybe seven episodes of One Piece.

294
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:36,840
Rym: I lectured on the anime opener to One Piece.

295
00:16:36,983 --> 00:16:37,227
Rym: Great.

296
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:37,940
Scott: That's so relevant.

297
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,879
Rym: In different languages.

298
00:16:39,621 --> 00:16:42,400
Scott: I read eleven volumes of the One Piece manga, the first eleven.

299
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,160
Rym: I read one volume of the One Piece manga.

300
00:16:44,682 --> 00:16:48,280
Rym: And I listened to four episodes of Anime Pulse.

301
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,560
Scott: I have seen a handful of the first ever episodes of TV One Piece.

302
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,353
Scott: And that's pretty much it.

303
00:16:57,514 --> 00:16:58,540
Scott: before seeing this movie.

304
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,940
Rym: One Piece six, the sixth movie.

305
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,041
Scott: I told you why you watch this one, because it's the one we could download the English subtitle.

306
00:17:06,061 --> 00:17:14,640
Rym: So we skipped One Piece, Clockwork Island Adventure, Chopper's Kingdom on the Island of Strange Animals, Dead End Adventure, The Cursed Holy Sword.

307
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,940
Rym: And when we watched Baron Omatsuri and the Secret Island.

308
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,563
Scott: So as soon as this starts, within 30 seconds, we're already like Slayer's movie, Ebro's Island.

309
00:17:24,306 --> 00:17:32,980
Rym: Now, you might think that's totally superficial because, all right, we're watching one of those OAV-ish movies from a TV show kind of stand alone.

310
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,740
Scott: Yeah, this is one of those things where it's like, OK, it's the characters you love.

311
00:17:37,081 --> 00:17:40,660
Scott: We came up with this all new story that's unrelated to anything else.

312
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:46,768
Scott: They literally go to an island separated from the world, go on an adventure, and then there's an end.

313
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:47,820
Scott: And that's the whole movie.

314
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:48,581
Scott: Right.

315
00:17:48,621 --> 00:17:52,140
Scott: But it's just like the Slayer's movie, just like a lot of Lupin movies.

316
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:58,660
Rym: But it was very telling because as we're watching the very beginning, it really felt a lot like Ebro's Island.

317
00:17:59,181 --> 00:18:11,918
Rym: And then I realized about halfway through this thing that it's also a Lupin movie and that all those not the good Lupin movies, no AVs, but the and not the really bad ones, but like the mediocre ones.

318
00:18:13,222 --> 00:18:15,279
Rym: It's not that it's like a movie like that.

319
00:18:15,563 --> 00:18:15,928
Scott: It is.

320
00:18:15,949 --> 00:18:16,030
Scott: Yeah.

321
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:26,320
Rym: Literally, if you just took this and replaced all the characters with Lupin characters and changed the proper nouns of their dialogue, it might as well be a Lupin movie.

322
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,998
Scott: It might as well be the Slayer's movie if you change it, right?

323
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,277
Rym: It's like, I've no, no, no, no.

324
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,819
Rym: Well, it might as well be a Slayer's movie in terms of style and theme and story.

325
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:39,902
Rym: In terms of the interactions between the characters, there's one scene where they're on the boat.

326
00:18:39,922 --> 00:18:42,920
Rym: It's like, yeah, that's Zenigata, not Zenigata, that's Goemon.

327
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:43,401
Rym: Oh, yeah.

328
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:46,479
Rym: And again, like to the point that they could even say the same lines.

329
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:51,660
Rym: Yeah, it was so I I almost pictured it as a Lupin movie.

330
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:59,717
Rym: There's something about these like tier two mediocre anime OAV-ish movies to where they're all the same.

331
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,380
Scott: Well, it seems to me like, you know, this sort of two kinds of anime movies, right?

332
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,780
Scott: There's the real anime movies, which are sort of original.

333
00:19:08,122 --> 00:19:09,420
Scott: They're separate from everything else.

334
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:17,080
Scott: You know, the girl who lived through time is a Miyazaki movie or, you know, a Satoshi Khan movie or a Mamoruji movie.

335
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:17,442
Scott: Right.

336
00:19:17,743 --> 00:19:22,084
Scott: These things really stand alone as like these, you know, even like Pat LeBourne movie one.

337
00:19:22,104 --> 00:19:24,700
Scott: Would you think, oh, that's related to like this TV series and stuff?

338
00:19:24,883 --> 00:19:25,820
Scott: No, it stands alone.

339
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,747
Scott: It stands alone.

340
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:28,058
Scott: It's like this awesome movie.

341
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,180
Scott: It's got its own real plot and everything.

342
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:34,940
Rym: Now, this does stand alone in the sense that its plot is self-contained.

343
00:19:35,101 --> 00:19:41,140
Rym: And even if you know nothing at all about the characters, it kind of goes out of its way to explain everything about the characters.

344
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,140
Scott: Yeah, at least everything you need to know to understand the movie you're watching.

345
00:19:45,282 --> 00:19:45,906
Scott: I'm sure you can't swim.

346
00:19:48,461 --> 00:19:48,802
Rym: Right.

347
00:19:48,883 --> 00:19:53,383
Scott: It's like, yeah, I knew that before, but, you know, some other people might not have.

348
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:58,379
Scott: But yeah, it's like, you know, there's this other class of anime movie.

349
00:19:58,459 --> 00:20:02,560
Scott: that's not the compilation movie, but these sort of series movies, the Pokemon.

350
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:10,220
Scott: You know, it felt a lot like watching that third Pokemon movie or Lupin movie or, you know, any of those where there's movies are in a series.

351
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:14,680
Rym: But again, not a good anime movie, a mediocre one.

352
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,318
Rym: Yeah, I'm we're talking like Momo.

353
00:20:17,701 --> 00:20:20,340
Scott: Like not worth spending time to watch.

354
00:20:20,621 --> 00:20:23,260
Scott: Now, it has the, you know, the same sort of plot structure.

355
00:20:23,401 --> 00:20:23,603
Scott: Right.

356
00:20:24,711 --> 00:20:25,980
Scott: Here's all the characters you love.

357
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,924
Scott: Let's introduce them.

358
00:20:27,507 --> 00:20:30,459
Scott: Here is a some sort of hook for the thing they're going to do.

359
00:20:30,841 --> 00:20:31,624
Scott: They go there.

360
00:20:31,985 --> 00:20:41,015
Scott: There's something mysterious and there's some sort of silly and lighthearted introductory conflicts with lots of humor because of the beginning of the movie and lots of action.

361
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:41,380
Scott: Right.

362
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:48,953
Scott: And then the action starts to get a little more serious and some of the characters start to discover the mysterious thing that's going on.

363
00:20:49,034 --> 00:20:51,103
Rym: all of this, even in the lighthearted part in the beginning.

364
00:20:51,143 --> 00:20:56,353
Rym: There's always the the very obvious, sinister undertones, but nothing overt.

365
00:20:56,638 --> 00:20:56,780
Rym: Yeah.

366
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,760
Rym: And it just feels like in this movie, it zooms in on this flower on the guy's shoulder.

367
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,688
Scott: And, you know, we know immediately.

368
00:21:02,848 --> 00:21:06,366
Scott: anyone who has half a brain knows immediately that guy's a bad guy.

369
00:21:06,547 --> 00:21:08,620
Scott: That flowers the square boss, the end the end.

370
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:08,901
Scott: Right.

371
00:21:08,921 --> 00:21:10,920
Scott: You know, everything they show you this volcano.

372
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,564
Scott: You're like the endings.

373
00:21:11,685 --> 00:21:14,954
Scott: I said immediately beginning of the movie, the movie is going to end on top of that volcano.

374
00:21:14,995 --> 00:21:15,420
Scott: Was I right?

375
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,171
Scott: You were right.

376
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:16,580
Scott: I was right.

377
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,092
Scott: I didn't even two seconds of the movie.

378
00:21:18,112 --> 00:21:19,000
Scott: Didn't even know what the plot was.

379
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,519
Scott: They said they show you a volcano.

380
00:21:20,661 --> 00:21:21,608
Scott: They're approaching this island.

381
00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:23,264
Scott: I'm like, end of the movie is going to be on the volcano.

382
00:21:23,284 --> 00:21:24,140
Rym: So one other warning.

383
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:26,220
Rym: I read a thing on the One Piece movies.

384
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,813
Rym: It was like, yeah, they're all about 50 to 55 minutes.

385
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:36,752
Rym: So the first One Piece movie, 51 minutes, second one, 55 minutes, third one, 56 minutes, fourth one, 95 minutes, 95 minutes, 95 minutes.

386
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,100
Rym: They basically escalated.

387
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,799
Rym: One hundred and thirteen minutes.

388
00:21:42,422 --> 00:21:43,459
Scott: But how long is the one we watched?

389
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:47,300
Rym: The one we watched was 90 something minutes.

390
00:21:47,981 --> 00:21:48,121
Scott: Right.

391
00:21:48,282 --> 00:21:48,483
Scott: Yeah.

392
00:21:48,523 --> 00:21:52,608
Scott: We we went into this thinking it was going to be much shorter than like 50 minutes in.

393
00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:53,114
Scott: We're like, what?

394
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,980
Scott: And we go down to look at the progress bar and it's a little bit over half.

395
00:21:57,122 --> 00:21:57,959
Scott: We're like, what?

396
00:21:58,101 --> 00:22:04,680
Rym: At one point near the end, there's the scene that's just black and Luffy's just talking to himself and the pirate guys talking to himself.

397
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:08,899
Rym: And I'm like, and I clicked forward quite a bit.

398
00:22:10,122 --> 00:22:11,091
Rym: Screen was still black.

399
00:22:11,151 --> 00:22:12,060
Scott: Yeah, let's be honest.

400
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:12,341
Scott: Right.

401
00:22:12,361 --> 00:22:14,620
Scott: We got after we saw that we were only halfway through.

402
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,046
Scott: We sort of checked.

403
00:22:16,186 --> 00:22:18,940
Scott: We sort of click through quickly to look at each scene.

404
00:22:19,342 --> 00:22:23,583
Scott: But we didn't actually watch the rest in the entirety because that would have taken forever.

405
00:22:23,724 --> 00:22:26,802
Scott: And it was sort of unnecessary because we knew exactly what was going to happen.

406
00:22:27,103 --> 00:22:37,647
Scott: The only thing I didn't know, you know, predict that was accurate was the fact that, you know, after the square boss was revealed and, you know, they had the final encounter with the final bad guy.

407
00:22:37,687 --> 00:22:43,179
Scott: and the dire moment, you know, everything gets all trippy, of course, and dark and spooky.

408
00:22:43,981 --> 00:22:44,404
Rym: Of course.

409
00:22:44,565 --> 00:22:46,800
Rym: Usually they don't get this this movie.

410
00:22:47,181 --> 00:22:52,179
Rym: I was but for the end, I would have said this was not worth watching at all.

411
00:22:52,842 --> 00:22:55,655
Rym: But the end is actually pretty odd.

412
00:22:56,841 --> 00:23:01,260
Scott: It's where it is trippier and visually and aesthetically than I expected.

413
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:01,945
Scott: But it was still.

414
00:23:01,985 --> 00:23:03,479
Scott: I still expected trippiness at the end.

415
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:03,781
Scott: Right.

416
00:23:05,388 --> 00:23:08,380
Scott: That ending part was much extended.

417
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:14,980
Rym: Like usually it's like you reveal the square boss and within 10 minutes in Sailor Moon, when the evil flower on the guy's shoulders revealed is the bad guy.

418
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:15,764
Rym: Wait a minute.

419
00:23:16,831 --> 00:23:18,219
Scott: There's like to feed him then.

420
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:18,702
Scott: Yeah.

421
00:23:18,742 --> 00:23:22,760
Scott: It's like once you see the square boss, it's like and it's the over.

422
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,021
Scott: Right.

423
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:32,700
Scott: In this, like shit's revealed and that the battle with the revealed ending square boss lasts a long, good percentage of the movie.

424
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,960
Rym: You look at the Mepros Island movie and all these other kind of movies like it.

425
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:47,283
Rym: One thing I've noticed about the one characteristic is that the movie will have very long scenes where very little happens, very, very atmospheric and very atypical of the show there.

426
00:23:47,303 --> 00:23:49,959
Scott: But I mean, the Cowboy Bebop movie is the worst of those.

427
00:23:50,341 --> 00:23:50,542
Scott: Right.

428
00:23:50,582 --> 00:23:57,040
Scott: In terms of I mean, not that those scenes are bad, but just saying it has lots of long scenes where literally nothing happens.

429
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,402
Scott: Like now.

430
00:23:57,442 --> 00:24:02,740
Scott: another is like a five to 10 minute scene of Ed walking around town while the song plays, even though that's one of the best scenes in the movie.

431
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,604
Scott: It's nothing wrong with.

432
00:24:03,644 --> 00:24:07,141
Scott: I'm just saying is this talk about long scenes where nothing happens.

433
00:24:07,162 --> 00:24:10,617
Rym: There's a scene where Chopper gets waylaid in the typical.

434
00:24:10,677 --> 00:24:12,759
Rym: the sinister thing finally catches him when he's alone.

435
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,243
Rym: These are movies.

436
00:24:14,323 --> 00:24:19,786
Rym: It's like in a bubble gum crisis where I'm going in for a closer look means I'm going to die.

437
00:24:19,987 --> 00:24:22,159
Rym: Tell my kids I love them in a movie like this.

438
00:24:22,701 --> 00:24:26,520
Rym: I'm going to go explore around the island by myself and see if I can figure anything out.

439
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,280
Rym: is also code for an arrow is going to fucking kill me.

440
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:29,807
Rym: The end.

441
00:24:30,215 --> 00:24:30,459
Scott: Yeah.

442
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,240
Rym: But so there's a scene where choppers walk in and there's this really sort of surreal someone watching him thing and all these angle cuts.

443
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,345
Rym: It's an interesting scene.

444
00:24:39,365 --> 00:24:48,102
Rym: I actually really liked how the scene was played out, very similar to a scene in Ursa Yatsura to a beautiful dreamer, which also does all these things.

445
00:24:48,644 --> 00:24:56,480
Rym: And what's interesting there is that Ursa Yatsura to a beautiful dreamer was directed by Oshii and was very atypical of even the rest of the other movies.

446
00:24:57,341 --> 00:25:01,580
Rym: This movie, the one we watched, was directed by Mamoru Hosoda.

447
00:25:02,703 --> 00:25:03,609
Rym: I saw it in the credits.

448
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:05,100
Rym: I was like, can't be the same guy.

449
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:10,580
Rym: Totally the same guy as in the same guy who did the girl who left her time.

450
00:25:11,503 --> 00:25:11,726
Rym: Yep.

451
00:25:11,868 --> 00:25:12,659
Rym: Summer Wars.

452
00:25:13,543 --> 00:25:13,745
Rym: Yep.

453
00:25:13,825 --> 00:25:15,240
Rym: The Yu Yu Hakusho movie.

454
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,112
Scott: I know who it is.

455
00:25:16,194 --> 00:25:16,398
Scott: Yeah.

456
00:25:19,523 --> 00:25:21,019
Rym: So what was this movie about?

457
00:25:22,743 --> 00:25:24,980
Scott: Just a one piece character adventure.

458
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,760
Scott: You know, they go to an island.

459
00:25:27,821 --> 00:25:30,900
Scott: They think it's going to be a resort, you know, and they're going to have a good time.

460
00:25:31,401 --> 00:25:37,399
Scott: In actuality, it's some guy who presents them with challenges because, I mean, you can't have a tournament in one movie, but you can have challenges.

461
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:47,959
Scott: I was so waiting for that challenge to be a tournament at, you know, secretly and obviously the island is actually full of evil and they because they're good at the challenges, they get pulled into the evil part.

462
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:53,682
Scott: And after they all get a bunch of them get captured, of course, you know, Love is the main character.

463
00:25:53,723 --> 00:25:58,944
Scott: He saves the day at the very end after everyone else saves the minor day all throughout the movie.

464
00:25:58,984 --> 00:26:06,538
Scott: He saves the big day in with the help of some of the characters who are just created for this movie, you know, and that's it.

465
00:26:08,002 --> 00:26:16,779
Rym: A lot of trippy stuff happens, though, and I didn't expect that all the characters kind of got eaten by the flower and turned into goop.

466
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,018
Rym: Somehow they became human again.

467
00:26:19,502 --> 00:26:23,060
Rym: And the inside of the square boss is filled with filled with utenna.

468
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,087
Rym: Let's put it that way.

469
00:26:24,714 --> 00:26:25,320
Rym: It is filled.

470
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:29,440
Rym: I couldn't watch all of utenna and then watch this movie.

471
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,587
Rym: And you'll know exactly what I mean.

472
00:26:30,628 --> 00:26:32,139
Rym: There's no other way to describe that.

473
00:26:34,528 --> 00:26:34,569
Rym: No.

474
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:35,439
Rym: Movie's pretty bad.

475
00:26:36,021 --> 00:26:36,704
Scott: Yeah, it's not.

476
00:26:36,824 --> 00:26:40,320
Scott: I don't think you should really go out of your way to see this.

477
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:40,943
Scott: Right.

478
00:26:40,984 --> 00:26:43,480
Scott: I mean, who knows about the other one piece movies?

479
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,740
Scott: I mean, I'm someone who is a fan of part of one piece like when I be pirates.

480
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,040
Scott: Yeah.

481
00:26:49,061 --> 00:26:53,222
Scott: When I read one piece or watch the TV series, there's good parts, there's boring parts.

482
00:26:53,263 --> 00:26:55,300
Scott: The boring parts are fights that last too long.

483
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,219
Scott: The good parts are all the other parts.

484
00:26:57,722 --> 00:26:58,365
Scott: It's just fights.

485
00:26:58,425 --> 00:27:01,099
Scott: last too long is the better percentage of it.

486
00:27:01,741 --> 00:27:05,576
Scott: So, you know, it's like 25 percent of one piece is the best and 75 percent is boring.

487
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:11,100
Scott: And this movie did not have any of the good parts at all.

488
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:11,603
Scott: Really.

489
00:27:11,664 --> 00:27:12,678
Scott: Very, very few of them.

490
00:27:13,981 --> 00:27:16,080
Scott: You'd have to be like a crazy one piece fan.

491
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,320
Scott: Need to see all the one piece to watch this movie.

492
00:27:20,101 --> 00:27:27,920
Scott: Or maybe you're studying, you know, all of the anime movies that have this identical structure, in which case you need to see this one because it is a perfect example.

493
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:32,519
Rym: I feel like we could turn this into a panel if we put work into it on showing all these media.

494
00:27:33,222 --> 00:27:42,839
Scott: A whole bunch of movies and show how they're exactly the same goddamn movie and be like we can call the panel like seen one anime movie, seen them all.

495
00:27:43,421 --> 00:27:53,941
Rym: Now, what's interesting is that the the movie internally, it jumps around a lot, like very jarring transitions between scenes, which actually the Mipros Island movie kind of did that.

496
00:27:53,961 --> 00:27:59,447
Scott: Well, I think what early on in the movie, the cameras really in one place, right, because all the characters are together.

497
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:06,825
Scott: But then the characters sort to start to split up and it's cutting between what all the different characters are doing, supposedly at the same time.

498
00:28:06,845 --> 00:28:10,785
Scott: And that's where things can get a little bit confusing because the timing doesn't make any sense.

499
00:28:10,825 --> 00:28:19,600
Scott: No, but also you look at something like Lupin, there's Lupin, Jigen, Goemon and maybe they'll show you Fujiko, right?

500
00:28:20,382 --> 00:28:23,000
Rym: Or well, Zenigata is there, but every now and then you cut to Zenigata.

501
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:30,119
Scott: But it's like, you know, hardly ever do they actually, you know, depending on the movie, they might need it to only show Lupin and Fujiko and that's it.

502
00:28:30,381 --> 00:28:30,683
Scott: Right.

503
00:28:30,724 --> 00:28:32,820
Scott: I mean, or, you know, Lupin and the bad guy.

504
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,341
Scott: And that's it.

505
00:28:33,682 --> 00:28:39,642
Scott: And this they got to keep going to every different character in Luffy's crew.

506
00:28:39,682 --> 00:28:42,580
Scott: And his crew is like, you know, seven people in it.

507
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,365
Scott: There were people in the crew.

508
00:28:43,406 --> 00:28:45,280
Scott: I didn't know because I never got that far in one piece.

509
00:28:45,381 --> 00:28:45,523
Scott: Right.

510
00:28:45,544 --> 00:28:46,680
Scott: Like, who's that girl with the black?

511
00:28:47,241 --> 00:28:48,000
Rym: I have no idea who that girl.

512
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:48,884
Scott: I don't know who Robin is.

513
00:28:48,925 --> 00:28:52,285
Scott: I've never seen that red or seen that far in the one piece regular series.

514
00:28:52,305 --> 00:28:54,580
Rym: My problem with her is that she's too cool and confident.

515
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,279
Rym: She doesn't fit in his crew at all.

516
00:28:56,521 --> 00:29:02,020
Scott: No, you know, but Luffy is more like a Captain Taylor situation.

517
00:29:02,461 --> 00:29:04,220
Scott: Tyler, where he's cool and confident.

518
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:04,864
Scott: But is he?

519
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:06,500
Scott: But he gets it done.

520
00:29:09,663 --> 00:29:16,740
Scott: But yeah, they keep cutting between the characters until, of course, the secret evil guy removes the characters from the picture one at a time also.

521
00:29:17,124 --> 00:29:18,139
Scott: But that takes a while.

522
00:29:18,463 --> 00:29:19,680
Scott: That's like halfway through the movie.

523
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,300
Scott: They start going out of the picture.

524
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,686
Rym: So, yeah, I mean, you think at first it feels like there's going to be these four challenges.

525
00:29:24,746 --> 00:29:25,999
Rym: They have to pick up the goldfish.

526
00:29:26,842 --> 00:29:31,020
Rym: And then they have a speedboat race where they have to throw hoops at each other.

527
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,439
Scott: That one was weird.

528
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,300
Rym: And that one went on for like a half hour.

529
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,161
Scott: Yeah.

530
00:29:36,765 --> 00:29:39,000
Rym: And I guess we should have seen that come in a fight that takes forever.

531
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:39,761
Scott: Right.

532
00:29:40,544 --> 00:29:44,600
Scott: At least there weren't too many direct fights other than the ending fight.

533
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,711
Rym: Wait, spoiler, spoiler.

534
00:29:47,381 --> 00:29:50,360
Rym: And the very end, there's a dude who appears a bit through the movie.

535
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,258
Scott: Good guys win.

536
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,203
Rym: He's an uncle.

537
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:55,860
Rym: And the uncle is trying to be a badass for his kids, but he's a coward.

538
00:29:56,222 --> 00:30:00,040
Rym: And then finally, he minds up and hardens up and he's going to do the good thing.

539
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:06,600
Rym: He picks up the bow and arrow and he shoots it at the bad guy, the square boss, and it just fucking kills the square boss.

540
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:06,982
Rym: The end.

541
00:30:08,312 --> 00:30:09,320
Rym: It just it just works.

542
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,280
Rym: Why didn't anyone do that before?

543
00:30:13,163 --> 00:30:14,419
Rym: Why was it so easy to kill then?

544
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,211
Rym: Suddenly, I don't know.

545
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,459
Rym: Granted, we skipped a bit.

546
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,899
Rym: Maybe there's some baby ate some gum, gum, I don't know.

547
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:21,502
Scott: I don't know.

548
00:30:21,522 --> 00:30:24,020
Rym: This movie is weird.

549
00:30:24,802 --> 00:30:27,400
Rym: And you can kind of see the influence of Hosoda.

550
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:37,700
Rym: But I feel I think one of the things that drives all these movies to be similar is that you're either directly constrained if you work on one of these, because you can't kill a character.

551
00:30:38,262 --> 00:30:43,119
Rym: You can't alter the relationship between any main character and any other main character.

552
00:30:44,123 --> 00:30:46,080
Rym: You can't change the world's plots.

553
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,820
Rym: You always have to be in a setting that's like separate, like a special island somewhere.

554
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:50,302
Rym: Right.

555
00:30:50,322 --> 00:30:51,419
Scott: So basically what you do is you write it.

556
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,480
Scott: You take the characters with their personalities.

557
00:30:54,090 --> 00:31:04,759
Scott: You write a self-contained fan fiction story for those characters, and you make sure to reset the status quo and send the main characters on their way again at the end without any permanent change to them.

558
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:11,260
Scott: And you also, because you need to have permanent change, create some temporary characters that you can have a permanent change for.

559
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:21,479
Scott: A bad guy who gets defeated, you know, some help, some helpful local characters who improve and, you know, develop as characters and such that will never, ever be seen again.

560
00:31:22,204 --> 00:31:24,300
Scott: And, you know, it's the same thing happens every time.

561
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,940
Rym: Yeah, I feel like that's part of it.

562
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:36,899
Rym: And I think that's why some of the movies like this that really stand out, like particularly a Lupin or two, is because they took great liberties anyway and they went way out of character and did interesting stuff.

563
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,220
Rym: Maybe this movie.

564
00:31:39,901 --> 00:31:40,524
Rym: It was so.

565
00:31:40,584 --> 00:31:48,240
Rym: the interactions between his crew were almost like someone said, well, this guy likes this girl and this girl is mad.

566
00:31:48,582 --> 00:31:52,959
Rym: Like Nami's character might have been she punches people to show both anger and affection.

567
00:31:54,342 --> 00:31:57,520
Rym: I think that's the only direction they gave for her character in this movie.

568
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,099
Scott: Yeah, quite possibly.

569
00:32:01,325 --> 00:32:02,339
Rym: This movie was not.

570
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,120
Scott: I suppose if you're already like a huge One Piece fan, right?

571
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:06,845
Rym: It's not.

572
00:32:06,886 --> 00:32:08,160
Rym: it's not a One Piece movie.

573
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:18,940
Scott: Well, I'm saying I'm saying that if you are a huge One Piece fan, right, because the characters act in character, barely, you might, you know, they're in cardboard cutout character.

574
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:19,582
Scott: Exactly.

575
00:32:19,623 --> 00:32:24,820
Scott: But, you know, when people are huge fans of characters like that, they just get off on seeing those characters.

576
00:32:25,121 --> 00:32:26,320
Rym: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

577
00:32:26,721 --> 00:32:29,200
Rym: So this is American superhero comic syndrome.

578
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,243
Scott: Possibly.

579
00:32:30,344 --> 00:32:37,920
Rym: I care about the events that happen around character with a proper noun A as long as they fit into the cardboard cutout.

580
00:32:37,981 --> 00:32:39,138
Rym: That is proper noun A.

581
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,759
Scott: Hey, people are all about that.

582
00:32:42,922 --> 00:32:43,640
Rym: They are indeed.

583
00:32:44,985 --> 00:32:45,900
Rym: I don't know what I could like.

584
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,100
Rym: I would make fun of this movie, like go through the plot.

585
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:48,727
Rym: Dave and Joel.

586
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:49,235
Rym: Let's see.

587
00:32:49,397 --> 00:32:49,580
Rym: All right.

588
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,780
Rym: They land on the island.

589
00:32:51,101 --> 00:32:54,120
Rym: They have a bunch of really stereotypical set up like we talked about.

590
00:32:54,800 --> 00:33:06,420
Rym: This pirate captain surrounded by a bunch of people who all have leaves growing out of their heads in a fake town with Versailles and Moscow kind of inside of it.

591
00:33:06,802 --> 00:33:07,774
Rym: And really bad CG.

592
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,970
Rym: I don't know what was up with the CG.

593
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,561
Rym: It's 2005.

594
00:33:11,561 --> 00:33:12,254
Rym: They couldn't get good CG.

595
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:15,280
Rym: But they have a contest.

596
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:19,260
Rym: And the first contest is they've got to pick up a goldfish.

597
00:33:19,781 --> 00:33:21,900
Rym: But the goldfish is gigantic.

598
00:33:22,565 --> 00:33:23,739
Rym: And then they do it anyway.

599
00:33:24,261 --> 00:33:27,119
Rym: And then they have another contest where they have to throw hoops on each other.

600
00:33:27,563 --> 00:33:29,660
Rym: And then arrows come out and bullshit happens.

601
00:33:29,761 --> 00:33:32,076
Rym: Then an hour and fucking forever later, it's over.

602
00:33:33,121 --> 00:33:33,403
Scott: The end.

603
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:34,326
Rym: There's.

604
00:33:34,909 --> 00:33:40,059
Rym: I defy anyone to enjoy this movie unless you are trying to analyze it.

605
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,420
Rym: And even then, good luck.

606
00:33:41,501 --> 00:33:44,020
Rym: Maybe if you really like memorials and you're trying to see his influence.

607
00:33:45,161 --> 00:33:48,900
Scott: Yeah, I guess he sort of, you know, it seems like he just did this as a job.

608
00:33:49,121 --> 00:33:49,362
Scott: Right.

609
00:33:49,403 --> 00:33:52,380
Rym: Rather than well, the animation was pretty different.

610
00:33:52,841 --> 00:34:00,300
Rym: And especially some of the side characters he added, like look at the uncle who was a coward and those kids that was really hosted a feeling right there.

611
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:00,563
Scott: Yeah.

612
00:34:00,603 --> 00:34:01,820
Scott: I mean, that is one thing I noticed.

613
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,400
Scott: Watch the video we downloaded from the Internet.

614
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:04,641
Scott: Right.

615
00:34:04,661 --> 00:34:08,020
Scott: The encoding was not necessarily the highest.

616
00:34:08,341 --> 00:34:09,331
Rym: The CG was bad, nonetheless.

617
00:34:09,371 --> 00:34:10,138
Rym: Don't think that.

618
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:10,908
Scott: Well, it's from 2005, right?

619
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,500
Rym: Yeah, it was bad for 2005.

620
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:14,601
Rym: Yeah.

621
00:34:14,984 --> 00:34:16,980
Scott: But the what was I saying?

622
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:17,201
Scott: Right.

623
00:34:17,241 --> 00:34:23,257
Scott: You look and I look even looking at with our batting code that made things kind of blurry because it was a download from the Internet's.

624
00:34:24,722 --> 00:34:26,860
Scott: You know, it looked like things were a little off.

625
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,099
Scott: I'm like, hey, those characters aren't looking like how they look.

626
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:32,079
Scott: Usually it's a little bit off.

627
00:34:32,581 --> 00:34:38,699
Scott: But according to the Internet's, it was, you know, this movie doesn't look like the other movies because Hosanna did that on purpose.

628
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:40,559
Scott: He made it look like his stuff.

629
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,679
Rym: Yeah, but he couldn't stray too far from those characters.

630
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:51,940
Rym: But obviously, so all his own characters like the normal people, Captain Hitler and all those guys, those other characters do not look.

631
00:34:52,300 --> 00:35:00,139
Scott: But, you know, the characters that are new for this movie don't look very one piece ish except for maybe the bad guys, you know, and they only look a little bit one piece ish.

632
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,498
Scott: And, you know, I don't think that the one piece guy actually designed these characters at all.

633
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:11,480
Rym: Yeah, but that flower, every time it zoomed in on the flower, it was exactly like when it zoomed in on the smiling frog in Mipros Island.

634
00:35:13,442 --> 00:35:19,840
Rym: Oh, so talking about a weird scene, there's a scene where basically Hitler is there.

635
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,920
Rym: Actually, it's a pretty funny scene.

636
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,380
Rym: Hitler's there and he's throwing rocks at Luffy.

637
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:31,360
Rym: And for some reason, this scene goes on for like a couple of minutes where this guy just keeps throwing rocks at Luffy and Luffy can't see where they're coming from.

638
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,720
Rym: And he keeps throwing bigger and bigger rocks.

639
00:35:33,262 --> 00:35:35,899
Rym: And then he finally finds the guy and tries to confront him.

640
00:35:36,523 --> 00:35:43,460
Rym: And then there's this weird scene where Luffy's like chasing the guy Scooby Doo style, and it just keeps going on and on.

641
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:46,740
Rym: It is almost identical to a couple of scenes.

642
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,200
Rym: It's really shit like pond movies.

643
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:49,739
Scott: And then it finally ends.

644
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:53,120
Rym: And there's the scene where Luffy's like standing there, there's out of a pool.

645
00:35:53,862 --> 00:36:00,479
Rym: And the guy's talking and Luffy's talking and barely anything that either one of them saying really makes much sense.

646
00:36:01,904 --> 00:36:03,098
Rym: And then it just kind of ends.

647
00:36:04,422 --> 00:36:08,140
Rym: And I guess the guy's captain of the mustache crew and he has a Hitler mustache.

648
00:36:08,961 --> 00:36:10,939
Rym: But then there's another pirate crew somewhere else.

649
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,289
Rym: They were the.

650
00:36:12,613 --> 00:36:13,038
Rym: what were they?

651
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,839
Rym: Because there's the mustache family.

652
00:36:15,221 --> 00:36:17,300
Rym: Yeah, there were some other pirate crew, pirate family.

653
00:36:17,482 --> 00:36:19,140
Rym: They were a modest pirate crew.

654
00:36:19,241 --> 00:36:20,018
Rym: And they were the red.

655
00:36:20,381 --> 00:36:23,040
Rym: No, the red tails was the doesn't matter.

656
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:23,838
Rym: So many pirate crews.

657
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:28,760
Scott: And it's like, I don't think, you know, it's like, what does it even mean to be a pirate in this world?

658
00:36:28,881 --> 00:36:31,220
Scott: It means you just have a you have friends.

659
00:36:31,502 --> 00:36:31,959
Scott: You have a team.

660
00:36:32,141 --> 00:36:34,200
Scott: You have a team on a boat that makes you pirates.

661
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,713
Scott: It's like a guy.

662
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,160
Rym: What do you pirate?

663
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,160
Rym: I guess maybe that's why they're after the one piece.

664
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,640
Rym: There was only one pirate ever.

665
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,279
Rym: And he plundered and pillaged.

666
00:36:43,823 --> 00:36:45,598
Rym: And he's got pirate booty and they want to get it.

667
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:46,445
Rym: Maybe.

668
00:36:46,566 --> 00:36:47,900
Rym: And they don't realize how to get it.

669
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,279
Rym: They're going after him to be pirates.

670
00:36:50,525 --> 00:36:54,420
Rym: I don't think anyone but I don't have anything else to say about this movie.

671
00:36:54,802 --> 00:36:56,253
Rym: No, I can't even make fun of it.

672
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:57,100
Rym: It's just weird.

673
00:36:58,946 --> 00:37:00,219
Rym: So I think this breaks my rule.

674
00:37:01,122 --> 00:37:07,120
Rym: Usually whenever we review an anime movie, I always say there aren't that many anime movies.

675
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,460
Rym: You might as well watch them all.

676
00:37:09,721 --> 00:37:11,740
Scott: Well, no, that really just applies to.

677
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:15,479
Rym: That applies to anime movies that are not sequels to other anime movies.

678
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:23,450
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

679
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:28,550
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

680
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:33,969
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

681
00:37:34,231 --> 00:37:36,910
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

682
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:41,670
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

683

Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

685
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:52,590
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
