1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:15,467
Rym: It's Thursday, January 12th, 2012.

2
00:00:15,467 --> 00:00:16,020
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:17,986
Rym: I'm Riff.

4
00:00:18,842 --> 00:00:20,340
Scott: You're going slowly for no reason.

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,500
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:26,289
Rym: Tonight we talk about Magfest 2012.

7
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:27,453
Scott: Uh... Let's do this.

8
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:31,350
Scott: So, you know what?

9
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:33,590
Scott: On Monday, we do not have to go to work.

10
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,168
Scott: Do you know why?

11
00:00:34,694 --> 00:00:35,430
Rym: Uh, MLK Day?

12
00:00:35,632 --> 00:00:36,168
Scott: That is correct.

13
00:00:36,951 --> 00:00:42,930
Scott: You know that on the list of federal holidays, at least incredibly major holidays, that most people get days off for, right?

14
00:00:43,053 --> 00:00:43,289
Scott: Yup.

15
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:47,170
Scott: Only two of them are days for specific human beings.

16
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,509
Scott: There is Martin Luther King Day.

17
00:00:48,976 --> 00:00:49,188
Rym: Yup.

18
00:00:49,371 --> 00:00:50,307
Scott: Well, Martin Luther King Jr.

19
00:00:50,327 --> 00:00:50,449
Scott: Day.

20
00:00:50,632 --> 00:00:50,908
Rym: Yes.

21
00:00:51,272 --> 00:00:52,469
Scott: And Columbus Day.

22
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,970
Rym: We used to have... Now we have President's Day.

23
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,470
Scott: President's Day is not for a specific person.

24
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,230
Rym: I know, but it was two different people.

25
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:58,788
Scott: It was.

26
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,369
Scott: But anyway... Uh... Martin Luther King is awesome.

27
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:04,629
Scott: Columbus is a dick.

28
00:01:05,351 --> 00:01:07,989
Scott: We have a day for a really good person and a day for a really shitty person.

29
00:01:08,692 --> 00:01:09,686
Scott: So I was trying to think, well...

30
00:01:10,031 --> 00:01:12,250
Rym: Why don't we have a day for a middle-of-the-road person?

31
00:01:12,635 --> 00:01:12,825
Scott: No.

32
00:01:14,231 --> 00:01:15,930
Scott: Here's the real question that came up at work.

33
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,529
Rym: Why isn't there Norman Borlaug Day?

34
00:01:18,177 --> 00:01:18,367
Scott: No.

35
00:01:19,294 --> 00:01:20,270
Scott: Here's the real question.

36
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:20,690
Rym: Okay.

37
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:30,090
Scott: Can you come up with an American better than Martin Luther King, or even as good as, to replace the Columbus Day?

38
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:36,150
Rym: Wow, my brain went through a gigantic list of people who were all disqualified for not actually being American.

39
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:36,729
Rym: That's correct.

40
00:01:38,212 --> 00:01:39,530
Rym: Is Norman Borlaug American?

41
00:01:39,971 --> 00:01:41,348
Scott: I don't think so.

42
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:45,309
Rym: I don't actually know, and I feel stupid now.

43
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,388
Rym: We're on both Wikipedia-ing.

44
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:50,669
Scott: It says he was.

45
00:01:50,991 --> 00:01:51,529
Rym: Ah, we got it.

46
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,130
Rym: That was easy.

47
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,709
Scott: Find a third person.

48
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,889
Rym: I already got... I got one.

49
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:55,888
Rym: Goalpost.

50
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:56,648
Rym: Can't move 'em.

51
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,384
Scott: I'm just saying, there's not many.

52
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,550
Rym: Well, we got one, so why don't we switch?

53
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,370
Scott: Americans are mostly shitty.

54
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:06,990
Rym: No, we've had some good people, like, uh... I don't know, a lot of the founding founders.

55
00:02:07,763 --> 00:02:07,907
Rym: FDR?

56
00:02:09,176 --> 00:02:10,128
Scott: That was one that I thought of.

57
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,949
Rym: FDR's pretty good.

58
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,010
Rym: Hell, Teddy Roosevelt.

59
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,250
Scott: I don't think Teddy Roosevelt deserves a day.

60
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,870
Rym: Does he deserve it more or less than Christopher Columbus?

61
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,450
Scott: Yeah, but I mean, I deserve one more than Christopher Columbus.

62
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:31,330
Rym: Thing is, you know, I'm down with the hate on Columbus, but at the same time, a lot of the bad stuff that happened as a result of him was not intentional on his part.

63
00:02:31,912 --> 00:02:35,469
Scott: Then why don't we have, say, I don't know, Leif Erikson Day?

64
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:36,908
Rym: I don't know.

65
00:02:37,154 --> 00:02:37,648
Rym: Why don't we?

66
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,029
Scott: Or Eric the Red Day?

67
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:49,649
Rym: Possibly because there are a lot of Italian communities that actually lobby pretty heavily to keep Columbus Day celebrated in places that tried to stop celebrating it.

68
00:02:49,851 --> 00:02:52,829
Scott: We'll tell those Italian communities we're gonna change it to Marco Polo Day.

69
00:02:53,899 --> 00:02:54,189
Rym: Marco!

70
00:02:57,273 --> 00:03:00,530
Rym: So CES is happening, and nah.

71
00:03:01,297 --> 00:03:01,427
Scott: Yep.

72
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:01,776
Scott: Nah.

73
00:03:02,271 --> 00:03:02,790
Scott: There is nothing.

74
00:03:03,137 --> 00:03:03,226
Scott: Eh.

75
00:03:04,681 --> 00:03:12,930
Scott: Except... Except... I was looking, you know, 'cause it's tons of CES news, you can't avoid it, but you mostly just breeze past most of it 'cause it's almost useless completely.

76
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:21,390
Rym: Yeah, we just had a nice talk in the forum about how most of this stuff is companies manufacturing a product and then trying to manufacture a demand for said product.

77
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:23,270
Scott: Well, I mean, that's how you have to do it, right?

78
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,289
Scott: 'Cause the demand doesn't exist before you make it.

79
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,030
Rym: Well, there is demand for things, but no one makes them.

80
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,710
Rym: And actually, I wonder why some things don't get made sometimes.

81
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:38,150
Scott: It's because, and I've said this a lot recently, but it seems to me, this is just... I don't want to take this on a tangent, so let me say this without a reply.

82
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,510
Scott: Do not reply to what I'm going to say, and then I will do my news, right?

83
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:41,661
Scott: I'll.

84
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,830
Scott: If you look around the world these days, right?

85
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,090
Scott: We talk about the 1%.

86
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,770
Rym: Look around the world these days.

87
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,650
Scott: All the companies have all the money.

88
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,150
Rym: All the companies have all the money.

89
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:51,647
Scott: Stop it.

90
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:52,224
Scott: Okay.

91
00:03:52,611 --> 00:03:58,190
Scott: All the money is in all the bank accounts of the companies, not even the 1% people, the companies, right?

92
00:03:58,491 --> 00:03:59,708
Scott: Normal people have no monies.

93
00:04:00,132 --> 00:04:01,449
Scott: It's companies that have all the monies.

94
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,270
Scott: Like, you know, Apple has billions in the bank.

95
00:04:03,331 --> 00:04:04,449
Scott: Google, billions in the bank, right?

96
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,910
Rym: So most of the business is business to business.

97
00:04:06,172 --> 00:04:06,589
Scott: That's right.

98
00:04:06,932 --> 00:04:23,290
Scott: If you are a business and you want to make money, you should have businesses as your customers, not people, because you can get one customer that's a business and get a zillion dollars, or you can spend a lot of money on marketing and on crazy expense to get enough real people customers who each give you five bucks.

99
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:28,010
Rym: That's why day job I'm in that business, because the B2B has its own acronym for a reason.

100
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:28,570
Scott: Right.

101
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,449
Rym: Actually, that's technically an initialism.

102
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:45,690
Scott: Which is why even products that are consumer products these days, such as, you know, electronics, do more to serve other corporations, which will say pay for advertising on those products or such and such, than they do to serve the people buying those products.

103
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,250
Rym: So anyway, to keep the tensions away, there was one cool thing at CES.

104
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:54,168
Scott: There was one semi-cool thing at CES, or at least worthy of discussing, and that is Boxy Live TV.

105
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:59,089
Scott: So what this is, is if you have a Boxy box, you can buy this thing for 50 bucks.

106
00:04:59,755 --> 00:05:02,570
Scott: I don't know why they didn't come out with a new Boxy box that has this integrated.

107
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:02,987
Scott: They will.

108
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:03,649
Scott: Maybe they will.

109
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:07,408
Rym: Or maybe the Boxy box hardware is not selling well enough to be worth it.

110
00:05:08,832 --> 00:05:11,250
Scott: And it's a USB on one side and a coax on the other.

111
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:17,570
Scott: So it's small, but it's a lot like a video capture card, but it's actually doesn't do plain old video capture.

112
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:26,209
Scott: What you need to do is plug into it either an antenna for the air or clear q-cam, which is what I have, which is unencrypted cable TV.

113
00:05:26,713 --> 00:05:34,450
Scott: So it's just a TV tuner card with a USB, but Boxy provides an interface, the new version for this particular thing.

114
00:05:34,611 --> 00:05:41,196
Scott: So even though you'll be using, you know, just over-the-air TV, you don't interact with it in the same way.

115
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,949
Scott: you interact with over-the-air TV, which is changing channels and whatnot.

116
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:44,930
Rym: So here's the big question.

117
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:45,453
Scott: You got the.

118
00:05:45,473 --> 00:05:52,030
Scott: you're basically using the Boxy awesome interface to watch over-the-air live television in an awesome way.

119
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,890
Rym: So here's the big question live television.

120
00:05:55,011 --> 00:05:55,909
Rym: All right, I can see that.

121
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:05,150
Rym: I mean, I, you know, maybe I want to watch the game, but does Boxy now automatically do DVR type stuff, which is I don't think so, which is like why not?

122
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,750
Scott: Myth TV has done that for DVR stuff over a decade.

123
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:27,410
Rym: I think it's literally 99% of the reason why I would want to use this because if I have a Boxy box or a computer plugged into my TV already, and I'm going to plug the coax into the same TV, why even bother putting it through the Boxy box if all I'm going to do is watch the live thing anyway?

124
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,400
Scott: Yeah, I'm still trying to understand this.

125
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:35,650
Scott: like Myth TV, right, has been around since, let's see, when was Myth TV created?

126
00:06:36,537 --> 00:06:37,507
Scott: In '02, started in April '02.

127
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:44,230
Scott: So for 10 years, Myth TV has been a free DVR that you can install on any computer to turn it into a DVR.

128
00:06:45,453 --> 00:06:45,837
Scott: How come?

129
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,330
Scott: no other product is doing this?

130
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:55,530
Scott: Every DVR is either like one that comes with your cable or it's like, you know, freaking TiVo, which you had to pay a monthly fee or some nonsense.

131
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,590
Rym: Well, you had to pay a monthly fee at least at one point.

132
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:02,310
Rym: Why doesn't someone just sell-- It's got for the network information, so it actually had a list of all the shows.

133
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:08,629
Scott: Yeah, but why doesn't someone just pay, you know, just sell computers that already have Myth TV on them?

134
00:07:09,371 --> 00:07:10,122
Rym: Why doesn't someone?

135
00:07:10,143 --> 00:07:10,589
Rym: I'll tell you why.

136
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:13,830
Rym: One, you'd probably get sued by media companies again.

137
00:07:14,911 --> 00:07:18,409
Scott: All you're selling is computers, which is legal to sell computers, and it's legal to sell Myth TV.

138
00:07:18,692 --> 00:07:19,350
Rym: Ah, so here's the thing.

139
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,750
Rym: If I were making a device like that-- And Linux.

140
00:07:21,991 --> 00:07:33,530
Rym: The primary feature I'd introduce is straight-up automatic commercial blocking coupled with straight-up, you know, in case a commercial wasn't blocked by accident, the 30-second, minute, whatever sketch.

141
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:39,810
Scott: I'm just gonna distribute Myth TV's latest stable release on a stable Linux that it works on with hardware that I know it works with.

142
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,570
Rym: Also, Myth TV is really hard for normal people to use.

143
00:07:42,932 --> 00:07:44,070
Scott: And Ponzi also, and a remote.

144
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:57,510
Rym: And I would argue that the majority of the market who is capable of dealing with a DVR that doesn't hold their hands the entire way, 100%, is also the kind of person who is just pirating everything from Pirate Bay anyway.

145
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,330
Rym: See, this is why-- Why even bother with the stupid broadcast TV?

146
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,310
Scott: That's why, you know, people are worried, right?

147
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,830
Scott: You know, a really killed Myth TV is piracy.

148
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,810
Scott: Why should I bother DVRing shit on this download?

149
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:15,070
Rym: Yup, even though they have the same effect, because do you really think that people don't just skip the commercials when they DVR something?

150
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,529
Scott: Yeah, so BoxyLiveTV, like, good idea.

151
00:08:18,073 --> 00:08:20,450
Scott: But, A, it only works with BoxyBox.

152
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,030
Scott: You can't use it with a PC running Boxy, even with the new version.

153
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:27,790
Rym: Now, speaking of which, independent of that-- Two, it doesn't, you know, you can't, say, use encrypted cable.

154
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:31,470
Scott: Like, if you take a cable, put it into your cable box, and then take a cable out of that, it won't work.

155
00:08:31,931 --> 00:08:33,149
Scott: It has to be unencrypted cable.

156
00:08:34,191 --> 00:08:36,510
Scott: And three, well, yeah, it's 50 bucks.

157
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,568
Scott: It should be, yeah.

158
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:41,409
Rym: Yeah, so this is cool, but I think it's a terrible product.

159
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:46,570
Scott: I do-- The one thing, though, is it does put a good user interface on live TV.

160
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,056
Rym: Does it really?

161
00:08:47,177 --> 00:08:48,170
Rym: What is the user interface?

162
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,510
Scott: It looks like a TV guide, only using the Boxy remote.

163
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,770
Rym: So where does it get the data?

164
00:08:52,351 --> 00:08:53,390
Scott: I don't know where it gets the data.

165
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,089
Scott: Because TiVo, you-- No one's been discussing that.

166
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,069
Rym: Pay for that data.

167
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,770
Scott: I know, no one has been discussing where that data comes from.

168
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:02,448
Rym: Maybe Boxy made a deal, and that's why it costs 50 bucks, but even

169
00:09:02,488 --> 00:09:13,030
Scott: then-- But it looks like Boxy, it has little preview screenshots of every show, it says what time they start, it says whether they're HD, lets you share what you're watching on Twitter, you know, and it's got everything.

170
00:09:13,894 --> 00:09:15,369
Scott: All the descriptions of all the shows.

171
00:09:15,771 --> 00:09:20,209
Rym: Yeah, but does it let me save it in a, you know, nice format that I can then use to make a PMV?

172
00:09:21,514 --> 00:09:21,987
Scott: Uh, no.

173
00:09:22,732 --> 00:09:24,269
Rym: Ah, so it doesn't do anything I care about.

174
00:09:25,117 --> 00:09:25,370
Rym: Awesome.

175
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:33,450
Rym: So right along these lines, I just want to point out that there's this article, because CES, a whole bunch of manufacturers are talking about making smart TVs.

176
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:40,750
Scott: And when they say smart TV, what they basically mean-- A TV that sort of already has Boxy in it without a Boxy box, but worse than Boxy.

177
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,567
Rym: I'm gonna translate exactly what this is.

178
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:55,697
Rym: They want to make TVs with really shit, slow-ass interfaces that let you see a tiny subset of the censored content on the internet in a painful, slow, and tedious way.

179
00:09:55,717 --> 00:10:05,710
Rym: that will not be used by anyone who has the skills to use a real computer hooked up to their TV, nor will it be used by anyone who doesn't have those skills, because they won't be able to figure this out either.

180
00:10:07,571 --> 00:10:10,589
Rym: And you know what, the TV I have now, really nice, gigantic TV.

181
00:10:11,591 --> 00:10:17,290
Rym: It has, like, Yahoo bullshit in it, and if I plug an ethernet cable into it, it says it can play videos.

182
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:18,908
Rym: Fuck if I could get it to work.

183
00:10:19,871 --> 00:10:21,890
Rym: And I'm a senior, I'm a fighting professional.

184
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,329
Scott: Well, you're a glorified clock setter.

185
00:10:25,612 --> 00:10:27,330
Scott: I'm surprised your TV tells good times.

186
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,639
Rym: So I got a web browser to start, right?

187
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,406
Rym: After, like, five minutes, it loaded.

188
00:10:31,427 --> 00:10:32,190
Rym: It was just that slow.

189
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,190
Scott: I don't understand why these things, cable boxes, are the worst.

190
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:40,150
Scott: It's like you push down, down, down, down, down, and down.

191
00:10:40,351 --> 00:10:43,703
Scott: It's like Boxxy, at least, is immediately responsive.

192
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:45,490
Scott: You push the button, it goes d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d.

193
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,098
Rym: So I tried to get it to stream some video from my NAS.

194
00:10:48,158 --> 00:10:53,949
Rym: Yeah, it's not playing an MKV, or an MP4, or, you know what, any fucking format that I have.

195
00:10:54,452 --> 00:10:54,539
Scott: Yeah.

196
00:10:55,372 --> 00:10:57,070
Rym: And it was just completely useless.

197
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,010
Rym: Outerly, absolutely useless.

198
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:06,268
Rym: And I don't know, like, I don't think there's any market for this at all, because literally, I think, everyone who's smart enough to use something like this,

199
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:11,310
Scott: Who out there has a whole bunch of videos that they want to watch on the TV that are in the format that TV's gonna play?

200
00:11:11,653 --> 00:11:11,886
Rym: I know.

201
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:12,850
Scott: That he's gonna use it.

202
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:18,790
Rym: And there's no way anyone will get the licensing agreements to sell a TV that actually will just play the formats that people typically have.

203
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,410
Rym: And even then, there might be lawsuits about piracy, enablement, or whatever.

204
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:28,850
Rym: And the interface is just, like, they're guaranteed to be crappy, because without a keyboard, you're not gonna be able to search for stuff.

205
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:32,870
Scott: And Apple TV has a good user interface, but it can only play, like, Apple things.

206
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,469
Rym: And even worse, let's talk about Boxxy.

207
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,290
Rym: Boxxy has these little apps, right, that let you see content.

208
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:44,930
Rym: I pretty much had to give up on using Boxxy for anything but anime that I happen to already have downloaded.

209
00:11:45,491 --> 00:11:46,610
Rym: Because it does that really well.

210
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,181
Scott: I use it for the Crunchyroll app also.

211
00:11:48,221 --> 00:11:49,329
Scott: It's pretty much the anime app here.

212
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,622
Rym: Ah, but the Crunchyroll app.

213
00:11:50,642 --> 00:11:51,470
Rym: Let's talk about the apps.

214
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,348
Rym: Crunchyroll app.

215
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:57,210
Rym: This is not a problem for me or Scott, because I know how to use the mute button on my TV remote.

216
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:01,690
Rym: But I want to point out that if you watch a show and an ad comes on, you can't skip it, obviously.

217
00:12:02,692 --> 00:12:05,930
Rym: And they disable your volume control until the ad stops.

218
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,609
Scott: Well, the app does that.

219
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,232
Rym: Yeah, I know.

220
00:12:08,252 --> 00:12:09,599
Rym: The app does that.

221
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:10,805
Rym: But that's still bullshit.

222
00:12:10,865 --> 00:12:11,850
Rym: That angers me.

223
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:15,190
Rym: So as a result, why don't I just watch it on the Crunchyroll website?

224
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,704
Scott: Because on the Crunchyroll website, it's the same thing.

225
00:12:17,725 --> 00:12:17,765
Scott: Ad.

226
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:26,230
Scott: And you're not gonna tell me that pushing the mute button in the Crunchyroll video player is more convenient than pushing the mute button on your TV remote.

227
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,650
Scott: You're gonna do the same thing and have the same problem.

228
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:31,790
Rym: I have to go find my TV remote every time, because in Boxee, I got the Boxee remote out, not the TV remote.

229
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,630
Rym: The point of the Boxee remote was that I didn't need to also use the TV fucking remote.

230
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:39,890
Scott: Well, I have, like, a bunch of remotes, and I gotta use the, you know, the remote from my speaker system.

231
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:43,870
Rym: Yeah, no, I have three remotes, and I have a Bluetooth keyboard and a USB keyboard.

232
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:47,930
Scott: See, the thing is, if your problem is too many remotes, right, Boxee remote doesn't solve that problem.

233
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,040
Scott: No.

234
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:52,030
Scott: Boxee remote solves the problem of I want a keyboard without having to have a keyboard.

235
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:57,490
Rym: But Boxee remote doesn't have any way to do the mouse, so unless you're in Boxee, it's still pretty useless.

236
00:12:58,332 --> 00:13:00,970
Scott: Yeah, the Boxee remote doesn't solve that problem.

237
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:06,390
Scott: If the problem you want to solve, which is the problem of I have too many remotes, you have to get the Logitech Harmony.

238
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,281
Scott: The Logitech Harmony is amazing.

239
00:13:08,563 --> 00:13:09,610
Scott: People don't know about this thing.

240
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,917
Scott: Basically, it's a lot of setup in the beginning, right?

241
00:13:11,937 --> 00:13:19,910
Scott: You have to set it all up, and it might be too hard for people who aren't techy, but it should be, if you know how to set up your home theater yourself, you can set up the Logitech Harmony.

242
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:31,630
Scott: And what you do is you program it to be like, okay, listen, if I want to watch a DVD, you gotta turn on the DVD player, you gotta put the TV on video 3, and you gotta turn on the receiver and set the receiver to audio input 4.

243
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:44,770
Scott: And then you program all that, and then you push the DVD, after you program it, you push the DVD button on the Logitech Harmony, and it will turn off everything that's not the DVD player, turn on the DVD player, and set all those inputs, and you'll do it with one button press, because you programmed it.

244
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:58,424
Scott: And then you'll be like, okay, if I want to do the Wii, you gotta set the receiver to audio 5, and set the TV to video 1, and you program that in, and you have a Wii button, you push the Wii button, and your TV's in Wii mode, it turns the DVD player off, turns the Wii on, all

245
00:13:58,444 --> 00:13:58,766
Rym: that stuff.

246
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:04,490
Rym: So anyway, all the apps, the CollegeHumor app doesn't have all the CollegeHumor videos, it only has their originals.

247
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:05,490
Scott: That's CollegeHumor's fault.

248
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:08,750
Rym: No, it's the app's fault, alright, alright, it's the app's fault, again, I'll give it that.

249
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,610
Scott: CollegeHumor could have made their app include everything.

250
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,152
Rym: Let's get to that.

251
00:14:11,192 --> 00:14:15,070
Rym: The YouTube app, one, I can't close those pop-up ads.

252
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,610
Scott: It's slower than using real YouTube.

253
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,830
Rym: It's slower, and the search results are different.

254
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,528
Scott: Well, that's because you're not logged in.

255
00:14:21,811 --> 00:14:23,689
Rym: No, even if I, yeah, so how do I log in?

256
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:24,308
Scott: You don't.

257
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:24,794
Scott: Yeah.

258
00:14:26,592 --> 00:14:28,170
Scott: You're logged into Boxee, you're not logged into YouTube.

259
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,203
Rym: Again, that's the app's fault.

260
00:14:29,223 --> 00:14:29,587
Rym: You know what?

261
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:37,890
Rym: Communism didn't work so well as implemented by Russia, or China, or anyone in the world.

262
00:14:38,352 --> 00:14:40,263
Rym: But I guess it's just those implementations' fault.

263
00:14:40,283 --> 00:14:41,370
Rym: The idea must be sound.

264
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,530
Scott: That's not the same thing.

265
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:43,208
Rym: Just like Boxee.

266
00:14:43,691 --> 00:14:49,430
Rym: I find that Boxee is utterly useless to me compared to a web browser on the TV, because I just can't do stuff.

267
00:14:49,551 --> 00:14:52,170
Rym: And the Xbox, you think, all right, there's a YouTube thing in the Xbox.

268
00:14:52,713 --> 00:14:53,750
Scott: That's even worse than Boxee.

269
00:14:53,790 --> 00:15:04,710
Rym: Yeah, I really want to put together an expose, because I've done a bunch of side-by-side searches, and a shit ton of YouTube content is just missing if you use the Xbox 360.

270
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:10,030
Rym: And it seems to align with certain companies' ownership of the stuff in the videos.

271
00:15:10,852 --> 00:15:12,722
Rym: Like, it's not just logged in, not logged in.

272
00:15:12,742 --> 00:15:14,030
Rym: There's something else going on there.

273
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:14,960
Scott: How about Bidoof?

274
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,710
Scott: Can you watch Bidoof?

275
00:15:15,891 --> 00:15:17,043
Rym: Oh my god, Bidoof.

276
00:15:17,326 --> 00:15:17,589
Rym: Why?

277
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,250
Scott: He's so angry that he can't watch Bidoof on Xbox.

278
00:15:20,371 --> 00:15:21,206
Scott: He's as angry as Bidoof.

279
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,255
Scott: He's got a gun.

280
00:15:22,336 --> 00:15:23,344
Scott: He's shooting Microsoft.

281
00:15:23,445 --> 00:15:24,049
Scott: Oh my god.

282
00:15:25,312 --> 00:15:28,450
Scott: Oh, now he's up in the cloud with your save games.

283
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:33,269
Rym: All right, so I guess we should get on with the main thing, but I do want to talk about this, because it's kind of funny, but also sad.

284
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,410
Rym: You know what they're doing to Kim Jong Il's body?

285
00:15:36,017 --> 00:15:36,250
Scott: What?

286
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,568
Rym: They're Lenin-ing him.

287
00:15:37,996 --> 00:15:38,250
Scott: Okay.

288
00:15:39,353 --> 00:15:40,430
Rym: There's going to be a Lenin body.

289
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:41,710
Scott: That's what they did with his dad, too.

290
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:47,029
Rym: Apparently, his dad's body is interred there, but isn't visible, according to this one article.

291
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:50,489
Scott: What I heard is that the dad's body, they had to get this Russian dude.

292
00:15:51,232 --> 00:15:52,949
Rym: Yeah, they have Russian guys doing this one, too.

293
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:57,110
Scott: He's like the most expensive dude, but he can get the job done to make it look kind of okay.

294
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:57,602
Rym: Yep.

295
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:02,609
Rym: So they put him in his jumpsuit, and they put him in this thing, and he's sitting there with his little toes sticking up under a red sheet.

296
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,330
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

297
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:19,108
Rym: We've done a bunch of PMVs and AMVs for things of the day over the years, so I think it's time for a PPGMV.

298
00:16:19,871 --> 00:16:20,189
Scott: Okay.

299
00:16:20,371 --> 00:16:26,610
Rym: This is a Powerpuff Girls music video set to Him, the best character.

300
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:27,430
Scott: Him is the best.

301
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:37,530
Rym: Him, aka Akio in transvestite lobster form, is pretty much everything I like about Powerpuff Girls, as horrifying as that is.

302
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,890
Scott: I don't know why Him isn't in every episode.

303
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:40,890
Rym: There's just something about Him.

304
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,988
Scott: There's so many Mojo Jojo episodes, and I was like, "Yeah, he's not that

305
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:44,210
Scott: great.".

306
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:48,228
Scott: And then, it's like, "Well, Him should be the guy who's on all the episodes all the

307
00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:48,490
Scott: time.".

308
00:16:48,593 --> 00:16:48,679
Scott: Yeah.

309
00:16:49,619 --> 00:16:49,810
Rym: Anyway.

310
00:16:49,971 --> 00:16:51,150
Rym: Anyway, that's my thing of the day.

311
00:16:51,251 --> 00:16:51,910
Rym: This is pretty funny.

312
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,310
Scott: See, here's an awesome Flash game.

313
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,122
Scott: It's called "Let's Play" colon "Ancient Greek

314
00:16:56,162 --> 00:16:56,564
Scott: Punishment.".

315
00:16:58,471 --> 00:16:59,830
Rym: Oh my God, do I get to be Sisyphus?

316
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:03,830
Scott: You can be Sisyphus, Tantalus, Prometheus, Dunaides, or Zeno.

317
00:17:04,531 --> 00:17:07,869
Rym: Do you want to reveal what the deal with this game is, or let people play it?

318
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:12,670
Scott: Well, you play out the ancient Greek tortures of these various ancient Greeks.

319
00:17:13,012 --> 00:17:13,266
Rym: Oh, yeah.

320
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,309
Rym: So, play these games and let us know when you win.

321
00:17:17,692 --> 00:17:19,709
Scott: I'm filling the bath to wash away my sins.

322
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:21,290
Rym: Here I go.

323
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,029
Rym: How's that going for you?

324
00:17:22,531 --> 00:17:23,249
Scott: I got the water.

325
00:17:23,971 --> 00:17:25,130
Scott: I'm dumping it in the bath.

326
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,241
Scott: All right, the bath is 20% full.

327
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,310
Scott: I'm going back to get more water.

328
00:17:28,491 --> 00:17:29,510
Scott: Oh, the bath is full of holes.

329
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:31,830
Rym: Try to push that rock up the hill.

330
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:32,649
Rym: I heard that one's easier.

331
00:17:32,911 --> 00:17:33,749
Scott: Yeah, I'll try that one.

332
00:17:35,311 --> 00:17:40,230
Scott: Actually, the one where you got to scare the birds away from pecking away your liver.

333
00:17:40,451 --> 00:17:42,070
Rym: I could win that one with a drinking bird.

334
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:42,496
Scott: Yeah.

335
00:17:43,811 --> 00:17:45,450
Rym: I guess the drinking bird would eventually falter.

336
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:48,890
Rym: Also, drinking birds don't work unless they're dipping their beaks in some liquid.

337
00:17:49,251 --> 00:17:49,809
Rym: So, no.

338
00:17:50,094 --> 00:17:50,349
Rym: But, anyway.

339
00:17:51,976 --> 00:17:52,330
Rym: That's it.

340
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:53,127
Rym: Pretty good.

341
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,790
Rym: In the meta moment, the book club book is two books, which we'll be doing soon.

342
00:17:57,213 --> 00:17:57,627
Scott: Real soon.

343
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:58,348
Rym: Real soon.

344
00:17:58,652 --> 00:17:59,349
Scott: Next week, probably.

345
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,029
Rym: They're your books.

346
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,164
Scott: Yup, it is.

347
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:02,628
Scott: The Little Prince.

348
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:03,333
Rym: By.

349
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,149
Scott: Antoine de Saint-Ejupéry.

350
00:18:05,811 --> 00:18:08,170
Scott: And also, Wind, Sand, and Stars.

351
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:09,707
Scott: Il sait magnifique.

352
00:18:10,151 --> 00:18:10,969
Scott: By the same person.

353
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:11,849
Rym: They're amazing books.

354
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:12,969
Rym: Straight up.

355
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:13,810
Rym: I just got to tell you.

356
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:14,308
Rym: You should read them.

357
00:18:14,412 --> 00:18:14,788
Scott: And short.

358
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:15,445
Scott: Ish.

359
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,170
Rym: They're really short.

360
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,849
Rym: The Little Prince, you can read in, like.

361
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:18,630
Rym: A couple hours.

362
00:18:18,951 --> 00:18:19,508
Rym: A half hour.

363
00:18:20,231 --> 00:18:23,010
Rym: If you read it, like, quickly, ten minutes.

364
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:24,910
Scott: I don't know, ten minutes.

365
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,190
Rym: You could read that book in ten minutes.

366
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:27,250
Rym: I don't know, ten minutes.

367
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,269
Rym: You might not grock it.

368
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:29,830
Scott: Maybe, like, a couple hours.

369
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:33,070
Rym: You could read all the words in, like, ten or fifteen minutes.

370
00:18:35,422 --> 00:18:35,570
Scott: Okay.

371
00:18:35,893 --> 00:18:35,980
Rym: Yeah.

372
00:18:37,071 --> 00:18:40,829
Rym: We are going to be at the Penny Arcade Expo East, doing stuff like we always do.

373
00:18:41,392 --> 00:18:43,490
Rym: And if you didn't buy a badge, well, you fought because it sold out.

374
00:18:43,692 --> 00:18:44,990
Rym: You should have bought it a long time ago, like we said.

375
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:45,990
Scott: You can go to Anime Boston instead.

376
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:46,787
Scott: It's not sold out.

377
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:47,121
Rym: Yep.

378
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,430
Rym: And I'm going to advertise.

379
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:50,790
Rym: I'm looking for a system administrator.

380
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:51,908
Rym: Linux and Windows in New York.

381
00:18:52,534 --> 00:18:52,848
Rym: Email me.

382
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:53,928
Scott: You know, we're still not getting paid for this.

383
00:18:54,271 --> 00:18:54,629
Rym: Email me.

384
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,309
Scott: This is not cool.

385
00:18:55,611 --> 00:18:56,089
Rym: I'll give you a job.

386
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:56,770
Rym: You want to work for me?

387
00:18:56,892 --> 00:18:57,408
Rym: I'm a cool guy.

388
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,090
Scott: It's not cool.

389
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:58,788
Rym: I'm a cool guy.

390
00:18:59,130 --> 00:18:59,769
Scott: We still haven't.

391
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,408
Scott: We need to discuss this.

392
00:19:00,532 --> 00:19:00,907
Rym: Or girl.

393
00:19:01,711 --> 00:19:02,547
Scott: We need to discuss this.

394
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,210
Rym: Otherwise, conventions are off in the distance.

395
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,650
Scott: Nerd NYC recesses this weekend.

396
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,530
Rym: Yes, Nerd NYC recesses this weekend.

397
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:12,210
Rym: Scott will not be there because he's a little baby and has laundry to do and hair to wash.

398
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:14,029
Scott: Hey, what hair to wash?

399
00:19:17,136 --> 00:19:17,808
Rym: I will be there.

400
00:19:18,412 --> 00:19:19,310
Rym: On Saturday only.

401
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:25,809
Rym: I will be running one game in the evening slot, which I already ran at Burning Apocalypse Con to accolades.

402
00:19:26,851 --> 00:19:31,629
Rym: And if you want to be in that game, well, good luck because there's only four slots and a lot of people want to be in that game.

403
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:33,570
Rym: But I will play in some other games.

404
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:34,050
Rym: I'll be there.

405
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:34,509
Rym: I'll hang out.

406
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:34,968
Rym: I'll say hi.

407
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:35,405
Scott: It'll be cool.

408
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,870
Scott: One other game because that's all you get at recess is two games.

409
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,370
Rym: I think there's three games on Saturday.

410
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,235
Rym: Whoa.

411
00:19:41,215 --> 00:19:41,528
Rym: I don't know.

412
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:42,830
Rym: I haven't read any of the stuff.

413
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:43,629
Rym: I'm just going to show up.

414
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,169
Rym: But anyway.

415
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:45,808
Rym: That's it.

416
00:19:46,154 --> 00:19:46,470
Rym: That's it.

417
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:46,935
Scott: What?

418
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:49,049
Scott: That was pretty bad.

419
00:19:50,034 --> 00:19:51,530
Rym: I'm still hurt from Magfest.

420
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:52,922
Rym: My throat is still not 100% back.

421
00:19:53,851 --> 00:19:55,288
Scott: So we went to Magfest X.

422
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,070
Rym: We have been to two Magfests.

423
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:03,670
Rym: Magfest is the third best gaming con there is.

424
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:10,230
Rym: If you count both PAXes as one and you count ConnectiCon's gaming as its own con.

425
00:20:10,738 --> 00:20:11,369
Scott: What about Essen?

426
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,629
Rym: I've never been to Essen, so it doesn't exist.

427
00:20:14,015 --> 00:20:14,629
Scott: That we've been to.

428
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:15,547
Rym: Yeah, that we've been to.

429
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:20,399
Scott: Magfest, if you don't know, it's a four day, 24/7 music and gaming fest.

430
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:29,010
Scott: Not only is there gaming of all kinds, there is music of all kinds.

431
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,829
Scott: This is a con.

432
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:30,690
Scott: Well, of gaming kinds.

433
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:37,550
Rym: Where you go to a con and you have two full days of conning and then you realize when you wake up the next day, it's only Saturday.

434
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,190
Rym: And you have two more full days of conning.

435
00:20:40,512 --> 00:20:40,949
Rym: And you know what?

436
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,770
Rym: A lot of people show up Wednesday.

437
00:20:43,574 --> 00:20:43,684
Scott: Yeah.

438
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:50,350
Rym: I mean, we showed up Thursday like early afternoon and there were already a lot of people there.

439
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,729
Rym: We'd already missed a lot of gaming.

440
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:56,050
Scott: Yeah, it's only a kind of a few thousand people, like five, six, seven thousand, something like that.

441
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,810
Rym: Yeah, I heard that it was like six-ish thousand, which was a lot.

442
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:05,590
Rym: It was like 80% more than last year because they were limited by the venue last year, which was this tiny little crap hotel in the middle of nowhere.

443
00:21:06,551 --> 00:21:08,970
Rym: Now, they're in a weird venue.

444
00:21:09,593 --> 00:21:09,687
Scott: Yeah.

445
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,669
Scott: It's the Gaylord, which you've known about for a long time, but haven't been to yet.

446
00:21:13,312 --> 00:21:14,089
Rym: KazuKan is there now.

447
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:14,366
Scott: Yeah.

448
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:19,930
Rym: It is enormous, but not in the way that the BCEC is enormous.

449
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:25,290
Rym: The BCEC, where PAX East is, is like a hangar for spaceships.

450
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:25,870
Rym: Yeah.

451
00:21:26,031 --> 00:21:27,390
Rym: Or perhaps a spaceship.

452
00:21:28,072 --> 00:21:34,670
Rym: It is three gigantic, like gargantuan rooms and then a whole bunch of other stuff.

453
00:21:35,911 --> 00:21:41,990
Rym: The BCC is like a long city filled with all different kinds of spaces.

454
00:21:42,811 --> 00:21:53,050
Rym: The Gaylord can only be described as something wrought from corruption on a civic level, coupled with grand visions of a 90s convention center.

455
00:21:53,972 --> 00:21:56,430
Scott: It's such a weird place because it's so fake.

456
00:21:58,033 --> 00:22:01,089
Rym: It has a fake town around it and a fake town in it.

457
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:02,369
Scott: It's so strange.

458
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,630
Rym: We could do a whole show on this place that we were in.

459
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:10,330
Scott: But this place had to be created with mad corrupt moneys from somewhere.

460
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:11,408
Scott: I don't know.

461
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,650
Rym: The best we can say.

462
00:22:13,391 --> 00:22:18,710
Scott: If you look at it on Google Street View, you see it while it was still in construction, which is really strange.

463
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:21,550
Rym: Once I get the video up from this con, you'll see what we mean.

464
00:22:21,711 --> 00:22:26,030
Rym: I don't want to dwell on it, but it was an odd place.

465
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:46,768
Rym: It's kind of like if you took Roosevelt Island in New York City and put all the tourist places from New York, not the tourist attractions, like the real things like the Statue of Liberty, but all the kind of like shit-tier tourism like the South Street Seaport Mall and all those kind of like the TGI Fridays and stuff in Times Square and put

466
00:22:46,888 --> 00:22:47,270
Scott: all that.

467
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:57,410
Scott: And a really crappy part of Disney World, not rides, but like a character breakfast and a scenic walkthrough with animatronics.

468
00:22:58,191 --> 00:23:04,506
Rym: You built a town just for that, multiplied it by corruption, and then let some commuters live there.

469
00:23:06,253 --> 00:23:08,870
Rym: It's weird, and I don't know what my opinion is of it.

470
00:23:09,231 --> 00:23:11,050
Rym: I don't know what to say anymore.

471
00:23:12,655 --> 00:23:13,627
Rym: And I don't want to review it.

472
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,110
Rym: I want to review MagFest.

473
00:23:15,251 --> 00:23:20,447
Rym: But suffice it to say, if you go to MagFest next year or you go to Katsu-Con, you'll see what we mean.

474
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:37,570
Rym: It was really weird how many people came to this place on Saturday, not for MagFest, not for any other convention that was going on at the same time, but literally just to like go around the town and eat at the restaurants and like go to the character breakfast.

475
00:23:38,332 --> 00:23:40,550
Rym: This was like a resort destination for some people.

476
00:23:40,873 --> 00:23:41,369
Rym: Very strange.

477
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:42,685
Rym: Yeah, it was weird.

478
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:43,790
Scott: Anyway.

479
00:23:44,471 --> 00:23:50,088
Scott: So the bad things we had to say about MagFest are the same bad things we probably said the last time.

480
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:53,690
Rym: Yes, when we review cons, we try to get everything bad we have to say out first.

481
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:54,270
Rym: Do we?

482
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:54,949
Scott: I don't know.

483
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,550
Scott: In the past, we'd go look and listen.

484
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:56,874
Rym: No, we try.

485
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:58,290
Rym: We forget.

486
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:03,989
Scott: I haven't listened to our previous MagFest show from the MagFest 9, but I'm pretty sure we said the same things.

487
00:24:04,372 --> 00:24:06,090
Rym: No, one's coming off the list, but we'll get to that.

488
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:06,709
Scott: All right, anyway.

489
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,549
Scott: Reg still sucks.

490
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,430
Rym: It was not nearly as bad as last year.

491
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,309
Rym: But still sucks.

492
00:24:11,412 --> 00:24:11,474
Rym: Yes.

493
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:14,270
Rym: The Reg situation at MagFest is unacceptable.

494
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:15,490
Scott: Yes.

495
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:19,390
Rym: In fact, we got to wait in the very short, like special line.

496
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:19,908
Rym: And you know what?

497
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:22,610
Rym: It still took a while, like a half hour.

498
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:25,710
Scott: Yeah, you need that line to be way shorter.

499
00:24:26,518 --> 00:24:26,969
Rym: Mail the badges.

500
00:24:27,373 --> 00:24:28,190
Rym: Just mail them, guys.

501
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:28,730
Rym: You can do it.

502
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:29,427
Rym: Mail them also.

503
00:24:29,931 --> 00:24:30,829
Rym: I will help you do it.

504
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:31,328
Rym: Email me.

505
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,029
Rym: I will personally help you do it.

506
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:40,270
Scott: You could also just have, if you just had twice as many people doing the badge things and you shorten the process to where it was like, "Bam, here's your badge.

507
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:40,857
Scott: Bam, here's your

508
00:24:40,878 --> 00:24:41,142
Scott: badge.".

509
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,070
Scott: Then you'd be better.

510
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:44,881
Scott: The one thing they did improve, though, from last year is.

511
00:24:44,921 --> 00:24:49,390
Scott: last year, it was like specific badges were pre-numbered for all the people.

512
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:50,190
Scott: That was a disaster.

513
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,830
Scott: So they had to find your badge.

514
00:24:52,051 --> 00:24:53,749
Scott: This year, it was just like, "Here's your fucking badge.

515
00:24:53,932 --> 00:24:54,886
Scott: It's just the next one in the

516
00:24:54,906 --> 00:24:55,129
Scott: pile.".

517
00:24:55,231 --> 00:24:56,629
Scott: And that sped things up a bit.

518
00:24:57,012 --> 00:24:57,144
Scott: Yes.

519
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:58,990
Scott: But it's still major problems.

520
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:03,297
Rym: Also, if the con grows at all, they're going to hit the Otakon situation of, "All right, we got 30,000 people.

521
00:25:04,612 --> 00:25:05,345
Rym: We got to give badges

522
00:25:05,386 --> 00:25:05,528
Rym: to.".

523
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:15,850
Scott: They're also still doing legally questionable things like making you sign a waiver and checking your ID and putting a wristband on you, which other conventions do not do.

524
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:19,510
Rym: Actually, a lot of tiny, small shit conventions do some of that stuff.

525
00:25:19,931 --> 00:25:20,489
Scott: Big conventions don't.

526
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:27,710
Scott: So I'm saying, I've heard rumors, I don't know how true this is, that someone on the MAGFest staff is sort of a lawyer and that they do this stuff.

527
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,910
Scott: But it's like, "Listen, you need to get a real lawyer.

528
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:32,290
Scott: You have 7,000 people going to a big fancy hotel.

529
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,788
Scott: Get a real lawyer to tell you what to

530
00:25:34,829 --> 00:25:34,930
Scott: do.".

531
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,450
Scott: Because I'm pretty sure, I'm the lawyer, obviously.

532
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,409
Rym: Yeah, we are not lawyers.

533
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,550
Scott: We are not giving you legal advice.

534
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:44,208
Scott: But based on my convention experience from other conventions, I'm pretty sure that's not what you do.

535
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:44,750
Scott: Yeah.

536
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:49,167
Rym: The waiver, for one, in my non-lawyer opinion, means nothing.

537
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:55,404
Rym: You might as well hand them a piece of paper that says nothing on it and asking them to sign it.

538
00:25:56,191 --> 00:26:00,609
Rym: Two, this bracelet thing we talk about, when you register, they take your ID.

539
00:26:00,831 --> 00:26:03,290
Rym: And when I say they, I mean just some con staffer.

540
00:26:04,011 --> 00:26:13,530
Rym: And they put on you either a different colored wristband you're supposed to wear the whole weekend, that designates whether or not you're 18 and/or 21.

541
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:19,930
Rym: The goal is so that people who do room parties don't have to worry about IDs for drinking and that no statutory rape occurs.

542
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:28,609
Scott: Yeah, I'm pretty sure that by doing an ID check, that the con is now responsible if the wristbands get switched up, which is trivial for them to be.

543
00:26:29,193 --> 00:26:32,230
Rym: Also, the staffer, you know, I refuse to put on the wristband.

544
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,870
Scott: I also refuse to put on the wristband.

545
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,069
Rym: And the staffer gave me shit, but you know what?

546
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:39,190
Rym: One, I'm not wearing a wristband for the whole con, especially if it has no function.

547
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,550
Scott: Especially if it's mad uncomfortable.

548
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,610
Rym: And it has no function in the con itself.

549
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,730
Rym: And that is totally a lawsuit waiting to happen.

550
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:46,749
Rym: MagFest, I love you.

551
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,448
Rym: I don't want you to get sued.

552
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,710
Rym: Do not offer this service.

553
00:26:51,172 --> 00:26:52,790
Rym: I agree, it's an awesome service.

554
00:26:53,170 --> 00:27:00,170
Rym: I love the fact that when people came to our room party we were hanging out in, one guy had a blue wristband, so we were like, yeah dude, sorry, not giving you any beer.

555
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,789
Rym: But, uh, yeah.

556
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:04,389
Rym: Legally.

557
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:07,830
Scott: That dude could have easily swapped that wristband for a green one if he wanted.

558
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:12,370
Rym: Yes, and we probably could have gone after you if we'd gotten in trouble for that.

559
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,010
Scott: That's right.

560
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:19,328
Rym: So, while it's all cool, and I applaud the idea as being an awesome idea in practice, fucking don't do it.

561
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:19,722
Scott: Yup.

562
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:23,790
Scott: Secondly, they have a major problem with Securitad.

563
00:27:24,571 --> 00:27:35,690
Rym: Yeah, they, this year, they had, now it's interesting because this is a complaint we have about most conventions we go to in that they really don't know how to handle the fact that people will try to steal their stuff from their arcades or whatever.

564
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:36,588
Scott: It's really easy.

565
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,310
Scott: Everything's bolted down.

566
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:38,829
Scott: The end.

567
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,029
Scott: That way no one can take it.

568
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:48,647
Rym: So what MagFest did this year is if you went into the main hall, which was tabletop, vending, arcade, and consoles all in one area, so pretty much 90% of the con.

569
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,570
Scott: The whole con, except for concerts.

570
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,150
Rym: If you walked in with any bag, they demanded to search your bag.

571
00:27:53,513 --> 00:27:55,050
Rym: And if you had a laptop or anything like that?

572
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:55,588
Scott: Well, it was weird.

573
00:27:55,810 --> 00:28:01,870
Scott: It's like if you walked in there with any sort of electronic thing, they wanted to check it into their system and put a barcode on your bag.

574
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:04,330
Rym: Yeah, you're not putting a sticker on my laptop, dude.

575
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:05,389
Scott: Yeah, screw you.

576
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:05,969
Scott: It's not happening.

577
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:10,490
Rym: And then on the way out, they would search your bag and give you shit if you had a laptop.

578
00:28:11,171 --> 00:28:14,290
Rym: And it was just a disaster waiting to happen on so many fronts.

579
00:28:14,672 --> 00:28:16,610
Scott: I would purposely go down there without anything.

580
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:20,090
Scott: I never brought my laptop in there or anything so I could avoid being searched.

581
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:24,230
Scott: And half the time when I walked out of the room, they wanted to look at my stuff.

582
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,770
Scott: And when they looked, they just glanced.

583
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:26,868
Scott: They didn't really look.

584
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:29,310
Rym: So it basically, it annoyed everyone.

585
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,850
Scott: So it just annoyed me for no reason.

586
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,830
Scott: And half the time, they didn't even ask to look.

587
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:34,910
Scott: I just managed to sneak out without getting looked at.

588
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:38,390
Scott: And then it was like, well, if you're going to let people sneak out, why even bother?

589
00:28:38,611 --> 00:28:39,489
Rym: It was a giant pain.

590
00:28:39,731 --> 00:28:40,448
Scott: Just don't do it.

591
00:28:41,092 --> 00:28:48,090
Rym: Two, well three, I guess the final thing, which is kind of part and parcel of this, is that they kind of made up rules inconsistently throughout the con.

592
00:28:48,732 --> 00:28:53,810
Rym: All con, I would go out and buy a Starbucks in the convention and then take it back into tabletop.

593
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:58,290
Rym: And at one point on Saturday, I came back with a coffee I'd just bought.

594
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:59,821
Rym: And they're like, you can't bring that in here.

595
00:28:59,882 --> 00:29:00,670
Rym: No open containers.

596
00:29:01,595 --> 00:29:02,169
Rym: Out of nowhere.

597
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,170
Rym: And they made me throw it away before they let me in.

598
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,630
Scott: We had been eating and drinking in there the whole con, by the way.

599
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:10,530
Rym: And they claimed it was because they didn't want me to spill something on the consoles, even though I was going to tabletop.

600
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:21,530
Rym: But two, while I was being, they demanded I throw away my coffee, a guy walked in with like three Subway sandwiches and three Subway drinks, and the same person let him go right through.

601
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:22,045
Scott: Yup.

602
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:23,408
Rym: So seriously, guys.

603
00:29:24,131 --> 00:29:25,510
Scott: Here's my suggestion to you, Magfest.

604
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:30,590
Scott: The only thing you have to worry about, right, is your console stuff being stolen.

605
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,550
Scott: No one's going to steal an arcade machine, right?

606
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:36,870
Scott: The dealers can protect their own shit, as long as you have security walking around.

607
00:29:37,191 --> 00:29:37,790
Rym: Here's the problem.

608
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:42,950
Rym: The dealer area is in the rest of the con shared space, so they can't just lock the room at the end of the night.

609
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,870
Rym: They need to really put the dealers in a separate area.

610
00:29:45,113 --> 00:29:46,189
Scott: Well, that's definitely true.

611
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,310
Rym: But that's just, they need to get bigger.

612
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,649
Rym: They obviously couldn't get the space for them.

613
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:50,390
Rym: They can grow organically.

614
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:59,422
Scott: But anyway, the point is, it seemed like Magfest was worrying about attendees stealing other attendees' things, and it's like, Magfest, don't worry about that.

615
00:30:01,211 --> 00:30:04,330
Scott: Attendees are going to have their shit stolen if they're stupid, and that's their problem.

616
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:05,310
Scott: It's not your problem.

617
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:08,010
Scott: Just be like, well, tough shit, right?

618
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,629
Scott: It's like, you didn't protect your shit.

619
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:14,390
Rym: But the moment you try to help, the moment you try to do the right thing, you think it's cool.

620
00:30:14,694 --> 00:30:16,030
Rym: Yeah, we're going to protect everyone's stuff.

621
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:19,030
Rym: Just like, yeah, we're going to try to make sure that underage kids don't drink.

622
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,649
Scott: All you're doing is pissing off people like us with hassling us.

623
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:26,750
Rym: Well, more importantly, again, one could argue that you are assuming liability if something does get stolen.

624
00:30:26,971 --> 00:30:27,610
Scott: But we're not lawyers.

625
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:33,230
Rym: Even though you have this fake waiver that probably, in our non-lawyer opinion, doesn't mean anything.

626
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:39,030
Scott: Yeah, all you got to do is protect your own console equipment by bolting it the fuck down, right?

627
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:42,568
Scott: And if you got wireless shit, you need someone standing there taking care of it.

628
00:30:43,272 --> 00:30:45,130
Rym: They didn't protect any of the tabletop stuff.

629
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,687
Rym: I mean, I walked in with like 15 games.

630
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,509
Scott: Yeah, they didn't even have a tabletop checkout.

631
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:54,770
Scott: Heels was like, oh my god, this tabletop is just games on a table with no one protecting it on total honor system, right?

632
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:57,109
Scott: It's like, I walked in and out with board games all night.

633
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:57,969
Rym: One time.

634
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:02,289
Scott: Nobody was checking to see if those board games I was walking out with belonged to the library or were mine.

635
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,309
Rym: One time, someone stopped me and said, are those all yours?

636
00:31:04,452 --> 00:31:05,006
Rym: And I was like, yes.

637
00:31:05,314 --> 00:31:06,030
Rym: And I just kept walking.

638
00:31:06,151 --> 00:31:07,890
Rym: And I think he tried to stop me, but I just kept going.

639
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:08,709
Rym: And they were all mine.

640
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,830
Scott: Yeah, but it's like, yeah.

641
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:13,369
Rym: Okay, so guys, here's the cool thing.

642
00:31:13,971 --> 00:31:16,650
Rym: That is literally every complaint I have about MagFest.

643
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:18,810
Scott: Everything about MagFest on the net is the awesomest.

644
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:21,730
Rym: Oh my god, MagFest was one of the best cons I've been to since PAX.

645
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:24,250
Scott: Oh my god, playing games until five in the morning.

646
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:24,608
Scott: Dude, guys.

647
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:26,970
Scott: Then waking up to do a panel at 10 in the morning.

648
00:31:27,091 --> 00:31:28,050
Scott: On Thursday.

649
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:29,230
Scott: A super art fight.

650
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:35,209
Rym: On Thursday, a little after midnight, we sat down to learn and then play Eclipse.

651
00:31:35,831 --> 00:31:36,970
Scott: Well, some of us already knew how to play.

652
00:31:37,072 --> 00:31:37,690
Rym: I didn't know how to play.

653
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:40,010
Rym: At 5am, we ended that game.

654
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:40,930
Rym: I was victorious.

655
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:42,962
Rym: And then, at 10.30am, we did a panel.

656
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:45,609
Scott: Eclipse is fucking awesome.

657
00:31:45,911 --> 00:31:46,850
Scott: We talked about that on Tuesday.

658
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:48,850
Rym: So here, let's talk about MagFest.

659
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:57,010
Rym: We can obviously, if you want to know the vibe or what MagFest is like and all that, you can listen to our previous episode on MagFest.

660
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:59,130
Rym: Because really, almost none of that changed.

661
00:31:59,452 --> 00:31:59,541
Scott: Nope.

662
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:03,010
Rym: It's the same vibe, same culture, same people, same arcade.

663
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:07,810
Rym: All that same stuff is just as awesome, if not more awesome, than it was last year.

664
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,730
Rym: So let's talk about what's different.

665
00:32:10,098 --> 00:32:10,165
Rym: One.

666
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:12,668
Scott: More space, which means that there was no B.O.

667
00:32:12,688 --> 00:32:12,910
Scott: smell.

668
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,660
Rym: Yeah, last year, the B.O.

669
00:32:14,701 --> 00:32:16,090
Rym: problem was out of control.

670
00:32:16,611 --> 00:32:17,009
Rym: This year?

671
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:17,982
Scott: I got a B.O.

672
00:32:18,043 --> 00:32:18,450
Scott: problem.

673
00:32:18,732 --> 00:32:19,047
Scott: This year.

674
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:19,518
Scott: I got a B.O.

675
00:32:19,558 --> 00:32:20,149
Scott: problem here.

676
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,197
Rym: There was effectively no B.O.

677
00:32:22,478 --> 00:32:24,870
Rym: other than the occasional fat guy walking by me.

678
00:32:25,413 --> 00:32:26,850
Scott: I don't think the problem was different people.

679
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:27,884
Scott: I think there was still B.O.

680
00:32:27,925 --> 00:32:28,210
Scott: people.

681
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:31,790
Scott: I think it was just simply that there was so much space and so much air and so much ventilation.

682
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,450
Scott: Dude, the ceilings were like 30 feet high.

683
00:32:33,591 --> 00:32:33,977
Rym: The B.O.

684
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:34,770
Rym: would go up there.

685
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:39,630
Scott: There was no way you were going to smell the B.O Unless you were like, even at the DDR machine, you weren't going to smell it.

686
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:40,430
Rym: That was crazy.

687
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:44,070
Rym: There were a ton of DDR and Bemani machines.

688
00:32:44,352 --> 00:32:44,850
Rym: And you know what?

689
00:32:45,491 --> 00:32:50,350
Rym: I wanted to play DDR and there were people playing DDR continuously all night.

690
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,089
Rym: Even Thursday.

691
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:52,370
Rym: All night.

692
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:52,970
Rym: And you know what?

693
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:53,620
Scott: You can go 3

694
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:53,925
Scott: a.m.,

695
00:32:54,046 --> 00:32:54,229
Scott: DDR.

696
00:32:55,191 --> 00:33:01,884
Rym: Even when the dude in the fursuit was doing 8 and 9 foot maniac songs on the machine, there was no B.O.

697
00:33:01,904 --> 00:33:02,530
Rym: smell anywhere.

698
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,570
Rym: I was kind of amazed.

699
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,704
Rym: Because I'd go to an arcade and there'd be B.O.

700
00:33:05,744 --> 00:33:06,630
Rym: at the DDR machine.

701
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,160
Scott: I'm pretty sure there was B.O.

702
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,050
Scott: smell in the fursuit.

703
00:33:09,832 --> 00:33:11,589
Rym: Yeah, but it didn't get out and it's all I care about.

704
00:33:12,512 --> 00:33:13,569
Rym: It's all I care about.

705
00:33:14,151 --> 00:33:15,110
Scott: They had some awesome games.

706
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,950
Scott: They had Initial D3, which is the one I've played the most, which is good.

707
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:18,710
Scott: 6 is better.

708
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:19,328
Rym: 5 is better.

709
00:33:19,328 --> 00:33:20,049
Rym: 4 is better.

710
00:33:20,311 --> 00:33:20,630
Rym: You know what?

711
00:33:20,731 --> 00:33:21,648
Rym: I sat down and played it.

712
00:33:21,648 --> 00:33:23,009
Rym: 3 is enough.

713
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,068
Rym: That'll do, pig.

714
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:26,130
Scott: 3 is still pretty fucking great.

715
00:33:26,391 --> 00:33:26,990
Scott: I can't imagine.

716
00:33:27,351 --> 00:33:28,729
Scott: I've played 4 a couple times.

717
00:33:28,729 --> 00:33:31,510
Scott: 5 and 6, I can't even imagine how awesome they are.

718
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,490
Rym: They had 2 X-Men machines instead of 1 this year.

719
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,089
Rym: One didn't work.

720
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,290
Rym: They got it fixed at one point.

721
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:35,607
Rym: Did they?

722
00:33:35,832 --> 00:33:36,509
Rym: I think it broke again.

723
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:39,570
Scott: The pinballs they had were great, but there were people playing them the whole time.

724
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,510
Scott: You'd wait in such line to get pinball going on.

725
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:44,310
Rym: You had to wait to play DDR and Initial D the whole time, too.

726
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:44,989
Rym: Except Thursday.

727
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:45,524
Scott: Yup.

728
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,289
Rym: I played all the Initial D I could on Thursday.

729
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,630
Scott: They had 2 magical drops in Neo Geos, actually.

730
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:53,310
Rym: They had 2 Dig Dugs side by side, 2 ice cold beers side by side.

731
00:33:53,912 --> 00:33:54,830
Rym: The arcade was the best.

732
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,090
Scott: One of the ice cold beers didn't really work.

733
00:33:56,351 --> 00:33:57,810
Scott: But it only was missing Rampart.

734
00:33:57,972 --> 00:33:58,624
Rym: So last year...

735
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:01,950
Scott: Only Rampart or Initial D 4, 5, 6 could have improved that arcade.

736
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,230
Rym: Last year I mused...

737
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:03,708
Scott: And more pinball.

738
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:07,830
Rym: How come PAX has a crap arcade compared to Magfest?

739
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,268
Rym: And this year I realized why.

740
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:18,469
Rym: The machines failed and broke at a surprising... Not a surprising, but a pretty good rate relative to the number of people playing them at this con.

741
00:34:18,911 --> 00:34:21,389
Rym: And they had people fixing them constantly, but you could see...

742
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:22,510
Scott: They got ahead of the game.

743
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:27,449
Scott: Because the problem is they were basically still sort of setting them up when we got there on Thursday, right?

744
00:34:27,731 --> 00:34:31,030
Scott: They didn't have them completely set up and all repaired when the con started.

745
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:36,170
Scott: So even though the con started, they're still getting some of them up to working that weren't working on arrival.

746
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,982
Rym: So Magfest, let's say it had 6,000 people.

747
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,329
Scott: It's like they didn't start out at 100% working.

748
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:45,409
Scott: They started out at like 67% working and they had to build up as they were using them.

749
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:46,562
Rym: Let's say Magfest had 6,000 uniques.

750
00:34:46,623 --> 00:34:47,148
Rym: Let's just say.

751
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:47,668
Rym: Okay.

752
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:48,856
Rym: A PAX has what?

753
00:34:48,856 --> 00:34:49,280
Rym: 15 to 20,000 uniques?

754
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:50,737
Scott: Yep.

755
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:57,170
Rym: Yeah, they would need like 4 Magfest arcades or else all the machines would fail.

756
00:34:57,271 --> 00:34:57,978
Scott: Here's the solution.

757
00:34:58,383 --> 00:34:58,828
Scott: You ready for my...

758
00:34:59,050 --> 00:34:59,749
Rym: Four arcades?

759
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:00,829
Scott: I got a few solutions.

760
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:03,570
Rym: Fill that third empty hangar with an arcade?

761
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:04,493
Scott: Here's my solutions.

762
00:35:04,553 --> 00:35:04,734
Scott: Ready?

763
00:35:04,774 --> 00:35:09,270
Scott: Number one, you have so many games that even if everyone's using them like crazy...

764
00:35:09,811 --> 00:35:11,170
Rym: Pinkie Pie, that's a lot of games.

765
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:11,539
Scott: That is.

766
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,949
Scott: Solution number two, get a lot of guys.

767
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:19,130
Scott: Because remember, if you're getting that many games, you're bringing in Videotopia and the ACAM and the Retro...

768
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:19,775
Rym: That's what I say.

769
00:35:19,835 --> 00:35:21,529
Rym: You bring in multiple groups and set up...

770
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,090
Scott: And they're basically, you're bringing in Pinball Joe.

771
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:26,430
Scott: You're bringing in everyone and all they've got, they're bringing their whole crews.

772
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:29,090
Scott: You have enough people who can fix the machines all at once.

773
00:35:29,371 --> 00:35:30,910
Rym: And PAX has the money to pay for that, I think.

774
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,780
Scott: And some of the machines are really durable.

775
00:35:32,821 --> 00:35:34,390
Scott: Your Dig Dug's not going to go down.

776
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:36,310
Scott: Only your ice cold beer and your pinballs are going to go down.

777
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,809
Scott: Anyway, number three.

778
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:44,450
Scott: Every machine, at least, will be free except the really popular ones.

779
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:47,146
Scott: Set them on 25 cents mode and all the money goes.

780
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:47,730
Scott: child's play.

781
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:49,177
Rym: Oh my god.

782
00:35:49,197 --> 00:35:50,246
Rym: Oh my god.

783
00:35:51,152 --> 00:35:53,850
Scott: If it's a machine that's not really getting played, make it free.

784
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:57,768
Scott: But the machines that are getting played like crazy, you don't need to make Dig Dug 25 cents.

785
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,228
Scott: I mean, that's bullshit, right?

786
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:00,354
Scott: But, DDR, 25 cents.

787
00:36:00,455 --> 00:36:01,139
Scott: Initial D, 25 cents.

788
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:05,330
Rym: I'm used to paying a dollar for Initial D, gladly.

789
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,054
Scott: Street Fighter 2, free.

790
00:36:07,455 --> 00:36:11,788
Scott: Super Street Fighter 4, whatever, Turbo, Hundreds, whatever, 25 cents.

791
00:36:12,751 --> 00:36:14,260
Scott: No more than 25 cents, obviously.

792
00:36:14,281 --> 00:36:15,045
Scott: But 25 cents.

793
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:16,930
Rym: What about Fatal Fury?

794
00:36:17,131 --> 00:36:24,910
Scott: And then, those games, a guy will have to go around collecting the quarters, so he'll make sure the games are still working in good condition when he goes to get the quarters.

795
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,650
Rym: I wonder if there might be legal stuff around that, but anyway.

796
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,784
Scott: What, having an arcade that charges a quarter?

797
00:36:29,804 --> 00:36:30,590
Scott: Is it totally legal?

798
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:34,230
Rym: No, because venue licenses, it gets complicated when you do that.

799
00:36:34,771 --> 00:36:38,090
Rym: The moment you go from providing it for free to paying for it, there are legal questions.

800
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:38,793
Scott: Just an idea.

801
00:36:38,813 --> 00:36:39,718
Scott: You just need some of these.

802
00:36:39,738 --> 00:36:42,170
Scott: These are just some ideas to make sure it goes.

803
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,081
Rym: But this isn't the Pac Show.

804
00:36:43,102 --> 00:36:43,750
Rym: It's the MagFest Show.

805
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:46,650
Scott: Also, bring a bunch of replacement joysticks and buttons and all that other good stuff.

806
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:47,909
Rym: So, another new thing.

807
00:36:48,251 --> 00:36:50,467
Scott: Also, set up the arcade a day in advance so it's 100% working.

808
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:51,670
Rym: They don't have the resources for that.

809
00:36:51,912 --> 00:36:53,090
Scott: At the start of the convention.

810
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:55,529
Rym: Anyway, different thing number two.

811
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:59,910
Rym: They had actual panel rooms that actually had enough seats for everybody.

812
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:03,550
Scott: And the convention center was very good about candy and water and all that kind of stuff.

813
00:37:03,911 --> 00:37:04,640
Rym: That was a separate thing.

814
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,510
Rym: I was talking about just the panel rooms.

815
00:37:05,672 --> 00:37:06,499
Rym: It's part of panels.

816
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:07,569
Rym: You need water.

817
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:11,930
Rym: I was going to talk about the venue separately, because I talked a lot to the convention center staff.

818
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:12,344
Scott: Alright.

819
00:37:12,892 --> 00:37:14,319
Rym: So, the panel rooms were good.

820
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,690
Rym: Only one room had a jank as broken projector.

821
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:20,610
Rym: Which was good, because it let us cut down on the demoing and get to the actual discussion.

822
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:25,710
Scott: It seemed like their systems were good and working, but it didn't seem like they had enough microphones and they were moving them around a bit.

823
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,270
Rym: Which was fine, because we're loud.

824
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,690
Scott: Yeah, I didn't even use microphones the whole panel time.

825
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:30,131
Rym: Yep.

826
00:37:30,271 --> 00:37:35,110
Rym: So we did Beyond D&D, which we rewrote for like the fourth time, and it went really, really well.

827
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:35,803
Rym: It's a good Beyond D&D.

828
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,770
Rym: It amazes me though, MagFest is weird.

829
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:43,590
Rym: It's a con where it's a lot of hardcore gamers who, as far as I can tell, have never read the internet about gaming.

830
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:48,610
Rym: Like, they have never heard of any of the stuff we talk about.

831
00:37:49,431 --> 00:37:54,129
Rym: And one of the gaming intellectuals panels we were on, a guy was like, "I'm going to demo this crazy

832
00:37:54,149 --> 00:37:54,410
Rym: game.".

833
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:55,340
Rym: And we had someone play the game.

834
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:55,745
Rym: It was VVVVVVV.

835
00:37:57,031 --> 00:37:59,209
Rym: The majority of the people in the room had never heard of it or seen it.

836
00:37:59,511 --> 00:37:59,858
Rym: So I was like,

837
00:37:59,879 --> 00:37:59,981
Rym: "What?".

838
00:38:00,431 --> 00:38:01,029
Scott: It's on Steam, guys.

839
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:02,042
Rym: Yeah, I was like, "Really?

840
00:38:02,184 --> 00:38:02,407
Rym: What?".

841
00:38:02,952 --> 00:38:05,230
Rym: I didn't really play it a lot, but I knew about it.

842
00:38:05,672 --> 00:38:08,788
Rym: At one point, I was like, "Yeah, so you've all played Binding of Isaac,

843
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:09,009
Rym: right?".

844
00:38:09,272 --> 00:38:10,129
Rym: Like, nobody had.

845
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:10,985
Scott: Yep.

846
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:11,629
Scott: Nobody.

847
00:38:13,232 --> 00:38:17,690
Scott: This is why you need to listen to GeekNights, so that you will be taken into the future.

848
00:38:17,831 --> 00:38:18,550
Scott: Dude, you listen to GeekNights?

849
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,830
Scott: We're basically living in the future.

850
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,504
Rym: And you go to MagFest, you will be a god.

851
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:27,808
Rym: You'll walk around and be like, "Hey, you want to play this game called Burning

852
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:28,150
Rym: Wheel?"

853
00:38:28,392 --> 00:38:30,090
Rym: And you will amaze people.

854
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:33,807
Rym: Hell, you could be like, "Hey, you want to play Settlers of

855
00:38:33,848 --> 00:38:34,230
Rym: Catan?".

856
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,725
Rym: And a lot of people will be like, "Oh my god,

857
00:38:35,765 --> 00:38:36,068
Rym: wow.".

858
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:36,357
Rym: Yeah.

859
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:36,735
Rym: Wow.

860
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,230
Scott: The tabletop library at MagFest is kind of sad.

861
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,369
Scott: That's why you got to bring your own.

862
00:38:40,853 --> 00:38:41,469
Rym: It was okay.

863
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:42,530
Rym: There were a lot of good games there.

864
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:43,550
Scott: But people love to play games there.

865
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,270
Scott: So if you bring your own games, it's totally awesome.

866
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:48,490
Rym: They had a good mix of really weird old games.

867
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:51,710
Scott: I guess what it is is they have pretty much one of each of the standbys.

868
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:54,030
Scott: They had two power grids in Agricola, a bunch of Settlers, a Carcassonne.

869
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:54,970
Rym: Three Puerto Ricos.

870
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:56,190
Scott: Right, some Puerto Ricos.

871
00:38:56,391 --> 00:38:57,429
Scott: So it's pretty much like, "Well, we don't need

872
00:38:57,449 --> 00:38:57,510
Scott: any.".

873
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:58,468
Rym: They had all the Dominions.

874
00:38:59,194 --> 00:38:59,469
Scott: That's true.

875
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:00,710
Scott: They had one of every Dominion set.

876
00:39:00,791 --> 00:39:02,350
Scott: So it's like, it's not so exciting to us.

877
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:09,830
Rym: But they had like old Candyland and like crazy weird... They had the old Battle Star Galactica and this weird Astro Boy game.

878
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:12,190
Rym: It was more like a lot of people played Candyland.

879
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:12,541
Rym: You know why?

880
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:15,590
Rym: They'd probably never actually played Candyland before.

881
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:20,328
Rym: And there's something fun about playing a weird, crappy game at a con drunk at 5 a.m.

882
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:21,569
Rym: with four strangers.

883
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:22,869
Scott: I saw people playing Monopoly.

884
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:23,538
Rym: Yeah.

885
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:25,570
Scott: But it was a pretty meager library.

886
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:27,365
Scott: But they had, you know, the basics.

887
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:29,059
Scott: The staples.

888
00:39:30,092 --> 00:39:30,809
Rym: It was pretty good though.

889
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:31,410
Scott: It was okay.

890
00:39:31,653 --> 00:39:33,290
Scott: Bring your own tabletop games to MAGFest.

891
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,189
Rym: So let's talk about panels a little bit.

892
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:38,870
Rym: MAGFest has a weird panel culture.

893
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:42,770
Rym: Partly because I think the con grew out of kind of its own culture.

894
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:46,710
Rym: Kind of like how PEX grew out of Necro Womacon and its own culture.

895
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:50,810
Rym: Meanwhile, Katsucon, Otakon, Anime Boston, all these kind of like standby cons.

896
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,950
Rym: Or like all the gaming cons or generic con and everything.

897
00:39:54,411 --> 00:39:56,482
Rym: They grew out of a sort of shared culture.

898
00:39:56,542 --> 00:39:58,050
Rym: so they kind of do things the standard way.

899
00:39:58,971 --> 00:40:02,970
Rym: The panels culture at MAGFest is really weird.

900
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:06,529
Rym: People in the audience just like shout stuff and just say things.

901
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:10,030
Rym: They'll be like, they want to just like interact.

902
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:11,267
Rym: Like they want to just talk to you.

903
00:40:11,891 --> 00:40:15,290
Rym: And for the discussion panels it was fine because we have a moderator.

904
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,550
Rym: And the audience like raised their hand and wanted to say something.

905
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:20,110
Rym: But, you know, we did Beyond D&D, a straight up lecture.

906
00:40:21,774 --> 00:40:23,610
Rym: And half the audience kept like raising their hand.

907
00:40:24,191 --> 00:40:26,009
Rym: They didn't yell stuff out, they just raised their hand.

908
00:40:26,677 --> 00:40:27,850
Rym: And we ignored them because that's what we do.

909
00:40:28,476 --> 00:40:29,570
Rym: We don't engage with the audience.

910
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,869
Rym: They kept their hands up the whole hour.

911
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:37,090
Rym: One girl, I felt bad for, she raised her hand, raised her hand, raised her hand.

912
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:41,850
Rym: Switched to the other hand, started holding it up with the other hand at the elbow.

913
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:44,050
Rym: It's like, look, if it's not obvious...

914
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:46,674
Scott: One guy even opened his mouth, he's like, can I say... I'm like, no.

915
00:40:46,896 --> 00:40:48,450
Scott: All I said was no and just kept going.

916
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,149
Rym: But after that, you know what he did?

917
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:51,209
Rym: Raised his hand.

918
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,484
Scott: Well, this other guy raised his hand and it's like.

919
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:58,450
Scott: he didn't realize that we weren't going to address anyone in the audience at any time for the entire panel.

920
00:40:58,811 --> 00:41:01,749
Scott: We didn't address a single person, but he thought somehow we were going to address him.

921
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:05,970
Rym: But anyway, we got video of all the panels and lectures we were on.

922
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:09,230
Rym: And we're going to get them on YouTube as soon as I can edit them together.

923
00:41:10,132 --> 00:41:10,556
Rym: And that's it.

924
00:41:10,596 --> 00:41:11,283
Rym: They were really fun.

925
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:11,970
Rym: They were really interesting.

926
00:41:12,612 --> 00:41:14,240
Rym: I think my favorite one was.

927
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,728
Rym: it was me, Scott, and Dr.

928
00:41:15,748 --> 00:41:19,690
Rym: Hazard just talking about like monetization models of games for an hour.

929
00:41:19,751 --> 00:41:21,450
Scott: And going off on tangents that were off topic.

930
00:41:21,591 --> 00:41:23,970
Rym: Yeah, but it was way fun because I really like talking to him.

931
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:28,270
Rym: And we didn't get to see him and talk to him for more than like two minutes for the whole con.

932
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:32,270
Rym: So the first time we see him to actually talk to him is on this panel.

933
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:35,828
Rym: So it was just us and him talking to each other in front of an audience for an hour.

934
00:41:35,848 --> 00:41:36,230
Rym: It was great.

935
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:36,987
Scott: It's pretty good.

936
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:37,530
Rym: Yeah.

937
00:41:38,153 --> 00:41:39,359
Rym: Ran into a lot of awesome people.

938
00:41:39,399 --> 00:41:39,781
Rym: John St.

939
00:41:39,822 --> 00:41:40,344
Rym: John was there.

940
00:41:40,384 --> 00:41:41,470
Rym: We didn't even get to say hi.

941
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:42,517
Rym: But yeah, dude.

942
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,489
Rym: Yeah, he did his thing.

943
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:44,977
Scott: You know, I've been to two MAGFES so far.

944
00:41:44,998 --> 00:41:47,350
Scott: I still haven't seen James Rolfe, not even from far away.

945
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:50,810
Scott: I saw a line to see him, but I didn't see him through that line.

946
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:51,111
Rym: Yep.

947
00:41:51,231 --> 00:41:56,890
Rym: The last time I talked to him was when I invited him to be on our failed late show attempt at PAX.

948
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:00,528
Rym: And then the follow up email when he was like, "Yeah, I'm not going to be at

949
00:42:00,588 --> 00:42:00,789
Rym: PAX.".

950
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:01,777
Rym: I was like, "Oh, that's fine.

951
00:42:01,837 --> 00:42:03,026
Rym: We just flew someone else in.

952
00:42:03,046 --> 00:42:03,328
Rym: We'll see

953
00:42:03,389 --> 00:42:03,530
Rym: him.".

954
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,462
Scott: He was at the last PAX, I think.

955
00:42:05,663 --> 00:42:06,830
Scott: Because he made a video about it.

956
00:42:07,111 --> 00:42:09,490
Rym: For whatever reason, we didn't get a chance to talk to him.

957
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:10,822
Rym: I think we had a panel at the same time.

958
00:42:10,944 --> 00:42:11,368
Rym: His panel?

959
00:42:11,388 --> 00:42:11,610
Rym: I forget.

960
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:12,510
Scott: I don't even know anymore.

961
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:13,475
Rym: Something came.

962
00:42:13,778 --> 00:42:15,410
Rym: There was a reason why we didn't go talk to him.

963
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:17,990
Scott: Biggest fan of this guy, but we never see this guy.

964
00:42:18,191 --> 00:42:19,663
Rym: I know, and it's weird.

965
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,530
Rym: We're in the same circles.

966
00:42:21,031 --> 00:42:24,810
Rym: He lives kind of near some people we know, and there's parties where people have been.

967
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:26,209
Scott: He's at the same conventions we're at.

968
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:28,690
Rym: Yep, we're both doing lectures and speaker stuff.

969
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:31,090
Rym: But it's like, for all this overlap, we never talk.

970
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:35,410
Rym: Kind of like how we know Dave Riley and Joel, but yet we never see them physically.

971
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:36,868
Rym: We only talk to them on the inner tubes.

972
00:42:37,211 --> 00:42:38,390
Scott: Yeah, well, that's how it goes.

973
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:40,450
Rym: Even though Dave's right there, like in Brooklyn.

974
00:42:41,473 --> 00:42:42,710
Scott: He didn't go to our New Year's party.

975
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:44,890
Rym: Let's talk about the venue from a convention perspective.

976
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:51,690
Rym: It's technically in Maryland, which is the same place that Otakon is at with the BCC.

977
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:59,950
Rym: The convention center staff, not the con staff, the convention center and the hotel, was brilliant.

978
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:03,521
Rym: They were so competent and cool and collected.

979
00:43:03,541 --> 00:43:05,909
Rym: I was amazed how professional they were.

980
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:08,329
Scott: They're getting paid with mad crab monies.

981
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:12,349
Rym: Compared to the disastrous staff at the BCC.

982
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:12,615
Rym: Yeah.

983
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:14,230
Rym: Like Otakon.

984
00:43:14,591 --> 00:43:16,670
Scott: Well, there's nothing wrong with Maryland, right?

985
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:17,550
Scott: It's Baltimore.

986
00:43:17,752 --> 00:43:17,818
Scott: Yep.

987
00:43:17,991 --> 00:43:18,608
Scott: That's a problem.

988
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:24,250
Rym: But it's sad because, you know, half my complaints about Otakon are actually complaints with the BCC staff.

989
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:25,069
Rym: And Baltimore.

990
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:25,688
Scott: And you know what?

991
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:26,649
Scott: And the security people they get.

992
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,890
Rym: There's nothing Otakon can do about that.

993
00:43:29,072 --> 00:43:29,689
Rym: I know the deal.

994
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:32,750
Scott: I know the red shirts, the brown shirts, the green shirts, the yellow shirts.

995
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:33,707
Scott: No, they can't.

996
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:34,368
Scott: Yes, they can.

997
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:41,930
Rym: No, because in the BCC, with the union rules and whatever, so they can choose from a number of vendors of security.

998
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:44,630
Rym: And as far as I can tell, they're all actually the same.

999
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:47,370
Scott: You can pay a whole lot more money to get out of that.

1000
00:43:47,912 --> 00:43:49,307
Rym: I don't know if you can at the BCC.

1001
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:53,190
Scott: There is always a way to pay money to get a different term on your contract.

1002
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:53,770
Scott: Not always.

1003
00:43:54,010 --> 00:44:03,209
Scott: Because basically what you'd have to do is you'd have to pay that union as much as you would if they worked, then not have them work and instead also pay, say, Blackwater to come and do the security.

1004
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:03,829
Rym: Okay, yes.

1005
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:05,570
Rym: There is a ludicrous and infeasible way.

1006
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:08,810
Scott: I said, I didn't say there was, I wasn't saying it was a feasible way.

1007
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:09,529
Scott: I said there was a way.

1008
00:44:09,771 --> 00:44:14,788
Rym: Yeah, I mean, if you can't get a badge to PAX, you could just found your own convention just as good as PAX and run it just for you.

1009
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:16,067
Scott: That's feasible.

1010
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:16,889
Scott: Yes, you could.

1011
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,869
Scott: There is an amount of money you could actually pay.

1012
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:19,650
Scott: Yeah, you know what, Scott?

1013
00:44:19,693 --> 00:44:19,927
Rym: There is.

1014
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:20,730
Rym: It's called magfest.

1015
00:44:22,611 --> 00:44:28,329
Scott: It's like, if I had enough money, I could just start a PAX and set the whole thing up and get the whole thing going and do all the work.

1016
00:44:29,051 --> 00:44:31,290
Scott: And then, you know, I could, and Robert Coop, like, Hey, what are you doing?

1017
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:32,790
Scott: I'd be like, I'm paying you to show up at this.

1018
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:33,329
Scott: He's like, really?

1019
00:44:33,631 --> 00:44:34,046
Scott: I'm like, yes.

1020
00:44:34,295 --> 00:44:34,669
Scott: How much?

1021
00:44:34,991 --> 00:44:35,510
Scott: A zillion.

1022
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:36,169
Scott: All right.

1023
00:44:36,392 --> 00:44:37,708
Scott: There's PAX three now, I guess.

1024
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:39,950
Scott: Cause Scott did it with a zillion dollars.

1025
00:44:41,813 --> 00:44:44,350
Scott: It could happen if you had a zillion.

1026
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:49,590
Rym: But yeah, the convention center staff were scary, like in a good way.

1027
00:44:49,892 --> 00:44:52,530
Rym: And I talked to a lot of them and they basically.

1028
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:56,990
Scott: I talked to a lot of people who were in the town and I was like, so what's up with this fake ass town?

1029
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:59,949
Rym: Yeah, the one girl I talked to was like, fuck if I know, I just work here.

1030
00:45:00,375 --> 00:45:01,050
Scott: This place is weird.

1031
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:02,590
Scott: I was like, you live in this fake ass place?

1032
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:03,269
Rym: She's like, fuck now.

1033
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:04,389
Scott: I was like, no, I live outside.

1034
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:06,868
Scott: I don't live here.

1035
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:09,230
Scott: Cause there are weird apartments in there and stuff.

1036
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:10,628
Rym: And people live there.

1037
00:45:10,854 --> 00:45:11,190
Scott: Frightening.

1038
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:16,050
Rym: But, uh, the, the venue is like enormous.

1039
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:17,490
Rym: Otakon could fit in there.

1040
00:45:17,611 --> 00:45:17,924
Rym: I think.

1041
00:45:18,751 --> 00:45:19,047
Rym: I think.

1042
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:23,810
Rym: The, the, what the trouble is, I didn't see all the space.

1043
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:26,590
Rym: Like I know every nook and cranny of the BCC.

1044
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:31,610
Scott: There was more space, but yeah, we weren't, there wasn't as nearly as many spaces.

1045
00:45:32,491 --> 00:45:36,307
Rym: Granted, Scott, I went like into some of the service corridors and I got into some of the other space.

1046
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:40,970
Rym: There are a lot of different spaces in that convention center that were untapped.

1047
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:46,170
Scott: There were many untapped spaces, but not nearly as much as the BCC.

1048
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:56,550
Rym: Well, it's hard to say if it would be a suitable, like viable alternative and I have to figure that out, but to figure that out, I would have to actually like, you know, talk to the convention center and walk around it for real.

1049
00:45:57,675 --> 00:45:58,709
Rym: But it's pretty big.

1050
00:45:58,952 --> 00:46:00,329
Rym: MagFest has a lot of room to grow.

1051
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:07,570
Rym: They will run into problems other than filling the space long before they fill the space.

1052
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:12,470
Scott: Oh, I figured out where the corrupt monies came from.

1053
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:13,223
Rym: Oh, will we?

1054
00:46:14,451 --> 00:46:24,969
Scott: The convention center hosted the 2011 Republican National Committee winter meeting at which the 2011 Republican National Committee chairmanship election took place.

1055
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:26,347
Rym: Duly noted.

1056
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:27,768
Scott: There you go.

1057
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:28,361
Scott: It opened in '08.

1058
00:46:29,051 --> 00:46:30,807
Scott: Oh, so maybe the corruption came in in '08.

1059
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:34,450
Scott: It cost eight hundred and seventy million dollars to build.

1060
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:34,900
Scott: Wow.

1061
00:46:36,591 --> 00:46:39,490
Rym: The one they want to build in New York is going to start at, what, a billion?

1062
00:46:40,031 --> 00:46:42,370
Scott: So, yeah, that's so corrupt also.

1063
00:46:42,513 --> 00:46:43,108
Scott: But you know what?

1064
00:46:43,692 --> 00:46:47,110
Scott: I kind of don't care because it serves, even though it's not.

1065
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:53,650
Rym: If the biggest convention center in North America happens to be on the same subway line I live on, I am not going to complain.

1066
00:46:53,791 --> 00:47:02,768
Scott: No matter how corrupt or evil or harmful it may be, for those five conventions a year I'll go to it for, probably, because you'll see all the conventions will move to it out of the Javits.

1067
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:08,169
Scott: I'll be going to New York Comic Con there, though probably someone will start another con there.

1068
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:08,969
Scott: That'll be awesome.

1069
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:11,370
Scott: Maybe the PAX will be there once it's out of Boston.

1070
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:11,848
Scott: Who knows?

1071
00:47:13,612 --> 00:47:13,888
Scott: But, yeah.

1072
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:19,490
Rym: So, what else can we say about MAGFest other than stuff that we said in the previous show about MAGFest?

1073
00:47:19,871 --> 00:47:20,888
Rym: You should go to it.

1074
00:47:21,493 --> 00:47:22,429
Rym: It's really fun?

1075
00:47:23,491 --> 00:47:27,390
Scott: We still didn't go to the concerts just because you were gaming like crazy.

1076
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:29,710
Rym: But Nobu was there with Earthbound Poppas.

1077
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:31,390
Scott: And you can see it all on YouTube and he was awesome.

1078
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:32,209
Rym: The whole thing's on YouTube.

1079
00:47:32,371 --> 00:47:33,789
Rym: He did the Colossus Roar.

1080
00:47:34,236 --> 00:47:34,430
Scott: Awesome.

1081
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:34,959
Scott: Yeah.

1082
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:44,129
Scott: Some other band, I think it was Bit Something, I forget their name, they had a guy play Mega Man 2 all the way through and they played the music during the whole thing.

1083
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:50,289
Rym: There was, and I do want to bring this up because you could not avoid it, a lot of My Little Pony at this con.

1084
00:47:50,531 --> 00:47:54,450
Scott: There was indeed much pony even though BronyCon in New York was at the same weekend.

1085
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:56,088
Scott: There was Mad Pony at MAGFest.

1086
00:47:56,510 --> 00:48:04,570
Rym: Like mad social currency and a girl dressed up in My Little Pony stuff totally groped my ass walking out of convention center after we talked about ponies.

1087
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:05,429
Rym: I think she was drunk.

1088
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:06,410
Scott: I had to tell on Rym.

1089
00:48:07,334 --> 00:48:09,990
Scott: I had to tell Emily on him because he was groping all the ponied ladies.

1090
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:10,765
Scott: I was like,

1091
00:48:10,807 --> 00:48:10,890
Scott: "Rym.".

1092
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:12,270
Rym: There was so much pony.

1093
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:13,509
Scott: You're not allowed to be groping ponies.

1094
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:18,630
Rym: The thing is, though, one girl, she made these cute rainbow- What's the word for somebody who gets it on with ponies?

1095
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:19,907
Scott: Equestrophilia?

1096
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:20,730
Rym: Equestrophile?

1097
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:21,250
Rym: Pona-phile?

1098
00:48:21,371 --> 00:48:21,644
Rym: I don't know.

1099
00:48:22,231 --> 00:48:26,390
Rym: But of all the stuff, there was this one hat that was kind of cute.

1100
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:31,450
Rym: It was like a Rainbow Dash hat, but actually when you wear it, it looks like you have Rainbow Dash's scalp.

1101
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:33,370
Rym: Like you've scalped her and put it on your head.

1102
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:36,570
Rym: It was kind of actually creepy seeing people wearing the hat.

1103
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:36,998
Scott: Yeah.

1104
00:48:37,695 --> 00:48:38,028
Scott: Not a fan.

1105
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:41,590
Rym: Oh, the guy who does that canvas pixel art was there.

1106
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:42,450
Rym: I like that guy.

1107
00:48:42,831 --> 00:48:44,829
Scott: Yeah, I got to get him to make me something to go over my TV.

1108
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:46,650
Rym: Yeah, I grabbed a lot of business cards.

1109
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:47,570
Rym: They're really cool people.

1110
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:48,950
Rym: The culture of the con is great.

1111
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:49,386
Rym: You know what?

1112
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:52,990
Rym: Magfest in this venue had one thing going for it.

1113
00:48:53,430 --> 00:49:00,750
Rym: The majority of the con was in one gigantic room, so you know how you do the wave in a stadium and it keeps going for a while?

1114
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:05,869
Rym: The Colossus Roar would start, and when people were feeling it, you know, like 3 a.m.

1115
00:49:05,949 --> 00:49:08,110
Scott: on Saturday- Yeah, it definitely increased at night.

1116
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:09,249
Scott: There'd be a lot more roaring.

1117
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:12,890
Rym: But it would keep going for like five minutes, like looping around the room.

1118
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:18,918
Rym: Saturday, one time, it just wouldn't stop because I remember it just kept going and it started to die out.

1119
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:21,210
Rym: and then over by the machine, we hear it start up again.

1120
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:22,188
Rym: It just didn't stop.

1121
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:23,510
Rym: And then Wyatt looks at me.

1122
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:26,387
Rym: He's like, "Oh my God, I want to punch every motherfucker in the motherfucking

1123
00:49:26,428 --> 00:49:26,689
Rym: face.".

1124
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,489
Scott: You know if you said that to me, you know what I would've said?

1125
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:29,990
Rym: You know what I said to Wyatt?

1126
00:49:30,754 --> 00:49:31,050
Rym: What?

1127
00:49:33,052 --> 00:49:35,270
Rym: I love that aspect of Magfest so much.

1128
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:35,678
Scott: Yeah.

1129
00:49:36,172 --> 00:49:36,610
Scott: It's weird.

1130
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:37,910
Scott: It's like normally, right?

1131
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:39,508
Scott: That would be like, "Wait, scratch

1132
00:49:39,529 --> 00:49:39,589
Scott: it.".

1133
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:40,370
Scott: But, scratch it.

1134
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:41,148
Rym: You know why?

1135
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:43,250
Rym: Because there's an unspoken rule.

1136
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:49,489
Rym: If you hear the Colossus roar, you respond in kind only if you are feeling it.

1137
00:49:50,452 --> 00:49:50,835
Rym: So 6

1138
00:49:50,835 --> 00:49:51,198
Rym: a.m.,

1139
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,630
Rym: I'm not feeling it anymore.

1140
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:53,049
Rym: You know what?

1141
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:53,888
Rym: No one else is too.

1142
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:56,240
Scott: So when one guy doesn't- But people are feeling it at 10 p.m.

1143
00:49:57,395 --> 00:49:58,009
Rym: Oh my God.

1144
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:00,130
Rym: Magfest is awesome.

1145
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:02,730
Rym: If you're a gamer of any stripe, you should go to Magfest.

1146
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,190
Scott: Or like listen to video game music.

1147
00:50:04,511 --> 00:50:08,090
Rym: If you like our kind of shit at Magfest, tell them you liked it.

1148
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:11,690
Rym: If you went to our panel and you liked it, tell them so we will do more stuff at Magfest.

1149
00:50:12,132 --> 00:50:15,589
Rym: Also, if you liked Super Art Fight at Magfest, tell them.

1150
00:50:16,231 --> 00:50:17,650
Scott: Yeah, we went to the Super Art Fight.

1151
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:18,209
Scott: It was awesome.

1152
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:18,849
Scott: It was awesome.

1153
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:24,141
Scott: I got photos of Magfest and also of the Super Art Fight in my Flickr because I have a camera now.

1154
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:29,069
Rym: Yes, we will have a whole bunch of content from Magfest up on the inner tubes in short orders.

1155
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:30,530
Scott: I have photos of things.

1156
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:31,068
Scott: Oh snap.

1157
00:50:32,031 --> 00:50:36,070
Rym: And of course, kind of end this, if you want to see us at other cons, just tell the cons.

1158
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:39,410
Rym: Don't tell us because I don't care anymore.

1159
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:43,150
Rym: But if you tell a con and they come to us, that has a lot more weight.

1160
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:44,788
Rym: Magfest came to us.

1161
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:46,389
Rym: We were like, alright dogs, we're down.

1162
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:47,006
Rym: And you know what?

1163
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:51,810
Rym: Magfest is added to the list of cons I would go to even if I were not a guest.

1164
00:50:52,952 --> 00:50:55,289
Rym: I would show up and pay just to play games.

1165
00:51:02,022 --> 00:51:04,140
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1166
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:09,259
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1167
00:51:09,661 --> 00:51:14,700
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1168
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:17,620
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1169
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:22,380
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1170

1171
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,180
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1172
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,300
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
