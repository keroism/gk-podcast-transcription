1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,457
Rym: It's Monday, August 13th, 2012.

2
00:00:12,457 --> 00:00:12,978
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:13,860
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,303
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,343 --> 00:00:18,750
Rym: Tonight, paying for stuff in the new way.

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,008
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,390
Scott: Yesterday, I go to my friend's wedding who I've known since forever.

8
00:00:30,653 --> 00:00:31,059
Rym: Which guy?

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,345
Scott: You met him once, Rick Cohen?

10
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:34,168
Scott: You met him once.

11
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,900
Rym: I do not remember that as even being a name.

12
00:00:37,644 --> 00:00:39,817
Scott: I think you went to a hockey game once.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,718
Scott: Minor League hockey game.

14
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:46,012
Rym: I vaguely remember that, but I don't remember a person.

15
00:00:46,173 --> 00:00:48,280
Scott: Anyway, I've known him longer than forever anyway.

16
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:54,940
Scott: But it was interesting because I didn't realize, I mean the wedding was in the temple, right?

17
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,312
Scott: It was a, you know, Jewish wedding.

18
00:00:56,332 --> 00:01:02,840
Scott: So you go and you know, it's four o'clock, they do the service, but then all the party was in the same building.

19
00:01:03,443 --> 00:01:06,497
Scott: So it sort of dawned on me like, "Oh shit, this motherfucker's

20
00:01:06,537 --> 00:01:06,879
Scott: kosher.".

21
00:01:09,162 --> 00:01:12,253
Rym: You know, going to Christian-y weddings is the same thing.

22
00:01:12,293 --> 00:01:14,521
Rym: You're like, "All right, the wedding's born, whatever, it'll

23
00:01:14,621 --> 00:01:14,782
Rym: end.".

24
00:01:14,802 --> 00:01:15,746
Rym: And then we go to the reception.

25
00:01:15,766 --> 00:01:21,008
Rym: As soon as you find out the reception's also in the church, that means no booze most of the time.

26
00:01:21,128 --> 00:01:21,710
Scott: Oh, you kidding?

27
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,959
Scott: There's open bars in every room of this place.

28
00:01:24,059 --> 00:01:24,260
Scott: Anyway.

29
00:01:24,401 --> 00:01:25,638
Scott: Oh, that's how the Jews go, I guess.

30
00:01:25,962 --> 00:01:27,519
Scott: Right, but no one tips the bartender.

31
00:01:29,301 --> 00:01:31,212
Scott: There were, I think I had some tips.

32
00:01:31,373 --> 00:01:32,258
Scott: Not everyone was Jewish.

33
00:01:37,206 --> 00:01:39,571
Scott: So, um, what's it called?

34
00:01:39,591 --> 00:01:40,893
Scott: So I'm more, I'm like, "Oh shit, it's

35
00:01:40,953 --> 00:01:41,394
Scott: kosher.".

36
00:01:41,474 --> 00:01:44,460
Scott: And it was, so it was meat and there was no dairy.

37
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,599
Scott: It's like there's a piece of bread on the plate when you go to sit at your table and there's something next to it.

38
00:01:49,061 --> 00:01:49,825
Scott: That ain't butter.

39
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:51,333
Scott: Don't know what it is.

40
00:01:51,354 --> 00:01:52,420
Scott: It's not butter.

41
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,650
Rym: Margarine?

42
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:54,340
Rym: Is margarine kosher?

43
00:01:54,722 --> 00:01:55,025
Scott: I don't know.

44
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:55,814
Rym: I'm gonna find out.

45
00:01:55,854 --> 00:01:56,340
Rym: You keep talking.

46
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:04,480
Scott: In the room, in the cocktail hour room, you go in and hidden in like the corner, there was some, you know, salmon and capers and onions and bagels.

47
00:02:05,062 --> 00:02:05,807
Scott: No cream cheese.

48
00:02:07,116 --> 00:02:07,659
Scott: No cream cheese.

49
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:08,681
Rym: Ah.

50
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,288
Scott: And it's like, "Oh right, no cream

51
00:02:12,328 --> 00:02:12,589
Scott: cheese.".

52
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,360
Scott: So the thing I was, you know, the thing is the food that they did have was excellente.

53
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,990
Scott: There was, there was many very, very tasty foods and also lots of hidden foods.

54
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:21,893
Scott: Like, they had.

55
00:02:21,953 --> 00:02:27,633
Scott: like, you know, it looked like an Ikea cabinet, you know, one of those like bookshelves with just a bunch of squares, like a whole bunch of them.

56
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,140
Scott: Like, you know, five by five squares.

57
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,451
Scott: And they had like fruits on plates inside this thing, just off to the side.

58
00:02:33,471 --> 00:02:34,675
Scott: You wouldn't even know if you didn't look.

59
00:02:34,715 --> 00:02:36,280
Scott: There were so many things to choose from.

60
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,840
Rym: Alright, it's really hard to make margarine kosher because of the, like the practices involved.

61
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:42,400
Scott: Yes.

62
00:02:43,322 --> 00:02:48,593
Scott: Anyway, but the one thing I was worried about the most was the wedding cake.

63
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:52,120
Scott: Because you know wedding cake tastes better than regular cake.

64
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:54,319
Scott: I don't know what the fuck they do with wedding cake.

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,960
Rym: The wedding cake is one, more expensive.

66
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:57,717
Scott: That's true.

67
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,500
Rym: And is not a Betty Crocker cake, which is the majority of cakes you've ever eaten.

68
00:03:03,201 --> 00:03:05,064
Scott: Right, but I mean there's something about wedding cake.

69
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:11,277
Scott: I think all the bakers have this conspiracy of like, "Oh, only make the right, cool, good kind of cake when you're for a wedding.

70
00:03:11,517 --> 00:03:12,640
Scott: Don't make good cake for anyone

71
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:12,760
Scott: else.".

72
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,564
Rym: Wait a minute, Scott.

73
00:03:13,605 --> 00:03:16,500
Rym: The next time we have a normal party, let's get a wedding cake.

74
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,259
Scott: That would be amazing.

75
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:17,918
Rym: Let's do it.

76
00:03:18,362 --> 00:03:19,580
Scott: A one layer wedding cake.

77
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,458
Scott: New Year's wedding cake.

78
00:03:20,964 --> 00:03:21,280
Rym: Perfect.

79
00:03:21,485 --> 00:03:22,079
Rym: Oh my god.

80
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,787
Scott: But, I was like, "Wait a minute.

81
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,777
Scott: This wedding cake's motherfucking

82
00:03:25,858 --> 00:03:26,260
Scott: kosher.".

83
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,386
Rym: Wait, now, why didn't they just not have the meat?

84
00:03:30,486 --> 00:03:39,940
Rym: Because I feel like if you got to give up one side or the other, and it's a party, why not go for the side that lets cake and breads be eaten more readily?

85
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,925
Scott: There was Mad Tasty Meats.

86
00:03:42,025 --> 00:03:44,112
Scott: They brought out this meat on a stick.

87
00:03:44,554 --> 00:03:46,160
Scott: Oh my god, meat on a stick.

88
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:49,904
Scott: I'm not complaining about the food.

89
00:03:49,924 --> 00:03:52,591
Scott: I'm just pointing out these funny "because it was kosher" bits.

90
00:03:52,992 --> 00:03:53,694
Scott: The food was great.

91
00:03:53,754 --> 00:03:54,656
Scott: It was just kosher.

92
00:03:54,676 --> 00:03:55,699
Scott: And as a result...

93
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,218
Rym: We need someone to make that song instead of, "Because I got high, it's because it was

94
00:03:59,258 --> 00:03:59,580
Rym: kosher.".

95
00:03:59,640 --> 00:03:59,840
Scott: Right.

96
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:01,303
Scott: The cake looked pretty good.

97
00:04:01,323 --> 00:04:04,187
Scott: It was a nice cake, ample size.

98
00:04:04,207 --> 00:04:08,433
Scott: I was worried that it wouldn't taste good because it was a kosher wedding cake.

99
00:04:08,914 --> 00:04:09,975
Scott: I was correct to worry.

100
00:04:09,995 --> 00:04:11,538
Scott: It was less good than regular cake.

101
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,207
Scott: Usually when you tell a story, you're like, "I was worried that X...".

102
00:04:17,307 --> 00:04:20,333
Rym: The story is always inevitably, "But luckily it wasn't

103
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:20,634
Rym: X.".

104
00:04:20,673 --> 00:04:22,537
Rym: You just told me, "I was worried he'd

105
00:04:22,557 --> 00:04:22,978
Rym: die."

106
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:24,140
Rym: And then he died.

107
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,511
Scott: Yeah, it was not... I didn't see too many other people eating it.

108
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:29,899
Scott: I think I might have been the only person who even tried to eat it.

109
00:04:31,701 --> 00:04:37,409
Scott: But yeah, it was like really thick frosting that was hard to make the decoration on the outside and it didn't taste good.

110
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,094
Scott: And then the inside of the cake was sort of hard and crumbly.

111
00:04:40,174 --> 00:04:42,057
Scott: It's like, "Yeah, okay.

112
00:04:42,558 --> 00:04:43,719
Scott: Kosher wedding cake, not...".

113
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:44,959
Rym: Not to the best.

114
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:45,540
Scott: No.

115
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:51,329
Scott: So, if you want really good wedding cake, don't buy it from the Jewish baker.

116
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:56,678
Scott: Or at least make sure you get a dairy cake from the Jewish baker.

117
00:04:56,718 --> 00:04:58,120
Scott: Don't get the meat part of cake.

118
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:01,046
Scott: That's all I can say about that.

119
00:05:01,187 --> 00:05:03,178
Scott: No one else really cares about some wedding if someone they don't know.

120
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,340
Rym: Yeah, but most people don't care about weddings to people they do know.

121
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,802
Scott: That's very true.

122
00:05:08,822 --> 00:05:13,952
Scott: It was actually, you know, I was... You know, whenever you go to a wedding, you're always like hesitant, like, "Is this gonna be

123
00:05:13,992 --> 00:05:14,413
Scott: good?".

124
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:18,140
Scott: I don't know, even though I like these people and, you know, they're all good people.

125
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:33,220
Rym: I've not had that problem because every wedding I've been to since I was a child has been for crew people where I know so many people there that the worst case scenario is I sit in the back and play Puerto Rico with people I know.

126
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:47,019
Scott: One more thing to point out is they had a band instead of a DJ and the band basically played non-stop for the hours they were allotted and then as soon as their time was up, they just started packing up immediately, which, you know, you want to go home.

127
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:47,620
Scott: Can't blame them.

128
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:56,693
Scott: But it's like you sort of realize when you have a DJ, the DJ doesn't have to put forth effort to like put on music like the walk out of the room music.

129
00:05:57,034 --> 00:05:58,396
Scott: So it's like party's over.

130
00:05:58,436 --> 00:06:01,060
Scott: It's just quiet and it's kind of awkward.

131
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:06,330
Scott: And like the caterers are all cleaning up immediately because they want to get their asses out of there, too.

132
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,257
Scott: And, you know, everyone's still standing there because the music just sort of was like, "Oh, we're

133
00:06:09,277 --> 00:06:09,418
Scott: done.".

134
00:06:10,501 --> 00:06:14,739
Rym: You know, when I think back, most of the weddings I've been to, I've been that guy who was there to the end.

135
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,112
Scott: No, I mean, you know, it was only from 4 to

136
00:06:17,112 --> 00:06:18,641
Scott: 10. 4.30,

137
00:06:18,641 --> 00:06:19,418
Scott: you know, everyone's tired.

138
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,120
Scott: No, it was 4 to 10.

139
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,859
Scott: You had to go to bed early.

140
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,960
Scott: Anyway, it was way past my dad's bed.

141
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:24,640
Scott: Marlon.

142
00:06:24,862 --> 00:06:25,580
Scott: Let's get out of here.

143
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:27,219
Rym: Marlon, I'm starting the car.

144
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:27,883
Scott: No, he went.

145
00:06:27,923 --> 00:06:28,950
Scott: He couldn't start the car.

146
00:06:29,191 --> 00:06:30,640
Scott: It was mandatory valet parking.

147
00:06:31,762 --> 00:06:34,358
Scott: So he went outside and was like, "Get in the valet to bring the

148
00:06:34,398 --> 00:06:34,620
Scott: car.".

149
00:06:36,448 --> 00:06:36,596
Scott: Anyway.

150
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:45,160
Rym: So, you know, I'm not going to really dwell on this, but just because it's in the news, Facebook, as you know, not to looking so good.

151
00:06:45,504 --> 00:06:46,237
Rym: Not to looking so good.

152
00:06:46,981 --> 00:06:54,580
Rym: I still stand by my initial, from the very beginning, prediction that the Facebook IPO was little more than a crass cash grab.

153
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:57,640
Scott: By the people who had bought it in the pre-IPO days.

154
00:06:57,941 --> 00:07:06,880
Rym: And by the people who ran the company, just for the sense that every big tech company before that point had been worth, you know, however many millions of dollars.

155
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:10,980
Rym: And then was worth nothing by the time anyone could actually cash out.

156
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,386
Rym: I feel like this is just Facebook saying, "You know what?

157
00:07:13,928 --> 00:07:17,079
Rym: Let's get our money from Wall Street, and then who cares what the fuck happens after

158
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:17,279
Rym: that?".

159
00:07:17,706 --> 00:07:18,299
Rym: It's my guess.

160
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,540
Rym: Just, you know, I'm not affiliated with Facebook, this is not stock advice, blah, blah, blah.

161
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,216
Scott: Strong sell, not stock advice.

162
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:32,800
Rym: I will say that I do not own any Facebook stock, and I have actually considered shorting it, because I think it's going to go way lower.

163
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:33,464
Scott: Do I?

164
00:07:33,645 --> 00:07:33,987
Scott: I don't know.

165
00:07:34,027 --> 00:07:35,013
Scott: I have a 401(k).

166
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:36,120
Scott: that's sort of just this mystery land.

167
00:07:36,241 --> 00:07:39,200
Rym: None of my 401(k) mutual funds have Facebook.

168
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:45,019
Scott: But I mean, I'm not even in, I'm like a layer away, I'm like the Fidelity something something, so I don't even know what fund it is.

169
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,200
Rym: If Facebook drops below like $12, I might consider buying some.

170
00:07:50,902 --> 00:07:51,068
Scott: Buy?

171
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:51,439
Scott: Okay.

172
00:07:53,061 --> 00:08:03,480
Rym: Anyway, so to add insult to injury, there's been all these articles talking about how all the ad clicks are fraudulent, and most of the accounts are fake, and people don't actually use it.

173
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,936
Rym: So one more here.

174
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:12,220
Rym: Apparently, a whole bunch of the high level staff of Facebook quit, possibly because they're rich.

175
00:08:12,963 --> 00:08:13,753
Scott: Oh, good job.

176
00:08:13,914 --> 00:08:14,319
Scott: Way to go.

177
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,680
Rym: They lost four of its highest level managers.

178
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,619
Scott: I salute you for doing what I would do.

179
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,360
Rym: The director of platform partnerships, the platform marketing director.

180
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,857
Rym: What the fuck do any of those jobs fucking do?

181
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,619
Scott: Those are all bullshit jobs that don't do anything.

182
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,180
Rym: I'm the director or vice president of product management.

183
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,414
Scott: I'm the grand vizier of who knows?

184
00:08:32,534 --> 00:08:33,240
Scott: I don't know.

185
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,707
Rym: To be fair, it's the descriptive title.

186
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:35,270
Rym: What do I do?

187
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,780
Rym: I manage the products.

188
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:49,920
Rym: So they've got a platform marketing director, and a director of platform partnerships, and a mobile platform marketing manager, and a design manager.

189
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:55,358
Rym: And all those guys, well, girl, guy, guy, guy quit.

190
00:08:56,743 --> 00:08:56,834
Scott: Okay.

191
00:08:57,702 --> 00:08:59,120
Rym: But that's not my news, because that's boring.

192
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,960
Rym: I just want to kind of kick Facebook while they're down, because I think Facebook has not peaked yet.

193
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:10,360
Rym: But I predict between now and three years from now, the peak of Facebook will happen, and it'll be nothing but decline.

194
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,060
Scott: I always think it's crazy how someone can be growing, but have a decreasing rate of growing.

195
00:09:16,421 --> 00:09:19,000
Scott: And as a result, the market just hammers them.

196
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,016
Scott: It's like, they're fucking growing.

197
00:09:21,097 --> 00:09:21,480
Scott: Come on.

198
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,334
Scott: I mean, not in Facebook's case, but other cases.

199
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,748
Rym: Well, maybe because you don't know those industries that well, and neither do I. We know Facebook.

200
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,480
Rym: We're like, yeah, they're growing.

201
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,370
Scott: But it's like, if I open up a dry cleaner, and in my first year, I get 100 customers.

202
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,075
Scott: In my second year, I got 200 customers.

203
00:09:36,115 --> 00:09:37,117
Scott: In my third year, I got 250 customers.

204
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:45,180
Scott: That dry cleaner's doing real fucking well, even though it didn't gain a hund- you know, its rate of customer increase was half of what it was in the previous year.

205
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:45,601
Rym: Well, it depends.

206
00:09:45,621 --> 00:09:46,363
Rym: What am I looking for?

207
00:09:46,403 --> 00:09:48,769
Rym: Were they spending money on trying to increase?

208
00:09:49,271 --> 00:09:51,055
Rym: Is there a saturation of the market?

209
00:09:51,496 --> 00:09:52,900
Rym: What are the same store sales?

210
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,429
Rym: Are other dry cleaners doing similarly well or poorly?

211
00:09:56,449 --> 00:10:00,300
Rym: There's all these other things, and we don't know them, because we're not businessmen like that.

212
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,825
Scott: I just came up with a crazy idea, though, as I often do.

213
00:10:03,787 --> 00:10:09,920
Scott: Imagine, right, Facebook is still kind of big, the way MySpace, when it died, was still largest.

214
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,919
Rym: I think Facebook is bigger than MySpace ever was.

215
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,883
Scott: Way bigger, right, of course.

216
00:10:13,907 --> 00:10:17,560
Scott: But the stock just completely dies, and they're basically fucked, right?

217
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:29,340
Scott: If the stock goes so low, like pennies or fractions of a penny, we can just buy it all and own Facebook when it's basically dead, the same way that someone bought MySpace when they were dead.

218
00:10:29,643 --> 00:10:31,020
Rym: Yeah, and how's that working out for them?

219
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:31,541
Scott: But think about it.

220
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:35,310
Scott: Millions of people will still go to Facebook.com, and we can just change it to FrontRecruit.com, right?

221
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:37,436
Scott: We just get 51% of those worthless shares.

222
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:48,657
Rym: I just- Facebook's peaking because it doesn't offer what people- you know, people say they want social stuff, like social networking.

223
00:10:48,678 --> 00:10:49,880
Rym: That's like the big thing on the internet.

224
00:10:50,521 --> 00:11:01,660
Rym: But I feel like what Facebook has become is like the stereotype of what people expect from that kind of thing, as opposed to what they actually would do on a regular basis.

225
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:06,236
Scott: Well, no, the real problem with Facebook is that they don't make fucking money, right?

226
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,700
Rym: And G+ is gonna make money?

227
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:18,780
Scott: No, but Google makes money by either- every product Google has either, A, displays ads that actually work, right?

228
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,439
Rym: But the ad market's a big bubble, and it's gonna collapse any day now, too.

229
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:32,620
Scott: Yes, but the Google ads are less bubbly because of their auction mechanic, and B, every other Google product generates data that allows them to improve things.

230
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:39,280
Rym: What about the claims of manipulation by, for example, the thing we were talking about the other day, where I- They give you free money to spend on Google ads?

231
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,869
Rym: Yeah, they gave me $100 to spend on ads, and it's free.

232
00:11:43,049 --> 00:11:47,540
Rym: You know, if I spend that $100 on ads, it doesn't cost them anything except ad time.

233
00:11:47,621 --> 00:11:49,958
Scott: That just shows you how much smarter Google is than everyone else.

234
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,900
Rym: But it pushes up the prices of the ads that I try to buy, because I have all this free money to leverage.

235
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,496
Scott: It sure does.

236
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,869
Rym: But Facebook, I guess you let me finish.

237
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:03,360
Rym: my point, is that think about what it really means to be social.

238
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:10,578
Rym: It's talking to your friends, exchanging information in a useful sense, and Facebook became the thing of friend.

239
00:12:10,618 --> 00:12:19,580
Rym: everybody you know, so now it's very hard to do the things that people actually do in the real world, like invite these four guys to their party but not those other two guys.

240
00:12:19,641 --> 00:12:20,338
Scott: Facebook does that.

241
00:12:20,885 --> 00:12:21,540
Rym: Not as easily.

242
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,660
Scott: It does it real easily.

243
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:27,551
Rym: Look at how the drama that most people have with Facebook and the way they use it.

244
00:12:28,474 --> 00:12:30,480
Rym: The information leakage is inevitable.

245
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,360
Scott: No one really has this kind of drama.

246
00:12:33,321 --> 00:12:33,939
Scott: You don't know normal people.

247
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,419
Scott: You don't even have a Facebook account.

248
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:43,880
Scott: You realize that you can be like, hey, event, invite, and you start typing people and it autocompletes all their names and you click okay, and then it invites those people.

249
00:12:44,702 --> 00:12:47,520
Scott: And you can say these people are family, these people are these.

250
00:12:48,442 --> 00:12:51,020
Scott: It's just like circles only with a crappier UI to organize the people.

251
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,840
Scott: Yeah, so here's what happens.

252
00:12:52,080 --> 00:13:02,000
Rym: People do that, they make the event, and then they post the photo from the event, and they don't direct it at those same specific people.

253
00:13:02,422 --> 00:13:04,793
Rym: And then Joey Jojo says, hey, how come?

254
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,260
Rym: we had a party and I was invited?

255
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,279
Rym: And the drama happens.

256
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,540
Scott: Well, if you have that situation, you have drama anyway.

257
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,259
Scott: No software is going to help you with that.

258
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:16,320
Scott: Well, to be fair-- If you're all using Google+, you still would have had the same problem.

259
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:20,240
Rym: No, because you say all the pictures from the thing, you put in the same set of circles much more easily.

260
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:26,960
Scott: No, because if you were--on Google+, you have to consciously say post this picture to these circles.

261
00:13:27,061 --> 00:13:28,420
Scott: On Facebook, you could do the same damn thing.

262
00:13:28,521 --> 00:13:32,020
Rym: Or you reply to the original invite as a comment and it's the same people.

263
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,951
Scott: You could do the same thing on Facebook also.

264
00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:35,540
Scott: You just have to be--it's up to you to do it.

265
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,620
Rym: Yeah, Google makes it easier.

266
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:40,460
Scott: The only thing Google makes easier is the interface of organizing the people.

267
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,900
Scott: That is the only real difference.

268
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,760
Rym: You seem to overestimate the average abilities of the average user.

269
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,940
Scott: I'm just saying, if they can't do it on Facebook, you can't do it on Google+ either.

270
00:13:49,100 --> 00:14:05,219
Rym: But there have been a bunch of articles talking about the place that Google is starting to surprisingly get market share either parallel to Facebook, or not really replacing Facebook, but being used despite Facebook is the fact that everyone has a Gmail account, so everyone by default has this sort of--.

271
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,100
Scott: That's what they tried to do with their Google Buzz originally.

272
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:16,240
Rym: Yeah, so but what happens is you're sitting there and you want to like, "Hey, I should talk to these three friends," and you just kind of click on them in Gmail and suddenly you got a video chat going.

273
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,929
Scott: The Hangout has definitely helped Google+ a lot.

274
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:23,520
Scott: Facebook really should have had something like that a long time ago.

275
00:14:24,182 --> 00:14:25,707
Scott: I don't know why they never have bothered.

276
00:14:25,727 --> 00:14:29,520
Scott: They maybe could have bought Skype instead of letting Microsoft buy it, you know.

277
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,049
Scott: But then again, there is a Microsoft-Facebook connection.

278
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:35,000
Scott: Yeah, but that's the one place Facebook is really missing out.

279
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,291
Rym: Well, Facebook also had the business model of be super spammy.

280
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:40,840
Rym: Look at how much it killed Zynga when they cut back on that spam.

281
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,142
Scott: Well, that wasn't Facebook's business model.

282
00:14:42,162 --> 00:14:51,400
Scott: That was people building on Facebook found value in being on Facebook because being super spammy allowed them to get stuff to be really popular.

283
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:57,500
Rym: But without that thriving marketplace of spammy people, it cut down on Facebook's value proposition from the business side.

284
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,464
Scott: Yeah, it's really easy now on Facebook.

285
00:14:59,785 --> 00:15:02,711
Scott: There are some people that we know that play stupid Facebook games.

286
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:06,739
Scott: So once a week, I'll see something like-- I'm not going to name any names.

287
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:07,160
Scott: You know who you are.

288
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,440
Rym: You should name some names because those people should know better.

289
00:15:10,642 --> 00:15:20,800
Scott: Jason Hawk, Laura, Bruce, Jared Sorenson playing Marvel Avengers Alliance.

290
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:21,581
Rym: What?

291
00:15:21,722 --> 00:15:22,807
Rym: Jared, you know better.

292
00:15:22,847 --> 00:15:24,052
Rym: You make games.

293
00:15:24,072 --> 00:15:25,720
Rym: Maybe he's doing market research.

294
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,340
Scott: You know, relatives of mine playing Slingo this or Bejeweled that.

295
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:31,514
Rym: No Facebook account.

296
00:15:32,722 --> 00:15:39,655
Scott: So anyway, they'll play some stupid game and they'll be noticed like so-and-so is invited you to What's-a-ville, right?

297
00:15:39,715 --> 00:15:40,537
Scott: And it's never Farmville.

298
00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:42,280
Scott: It's always something else at the castle or something.

299
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:47,009
Scott: And then you just click on this little arrow and you say-- you don't say block the person.

300
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:50,637
Scott: You say block the fuck out of Marvel Avengers whatnot.

301
00:15:50,677 --> 00:15:52,020
Scott: And then you just never see that shit again.

302
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,800
Rym: Yeah, and that kills a lot of the value proposition of Facebook.

303
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,200
Scott: Well, if you are Marvel's stupid social game, yeah.

304
00:15:59,461 --> 00:16:03,820
Rym: And those things-- I mean, look, didn't Facebook buy a bunch of Zynga, have a very tied interest?

305
00:16:04,062 --> 00:16:04,372
Scott: I don't know.

306
00:16:05,945 --> 00:16:06,779
Rym: Anyway, you got news?

307
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:12,493
Scott: I don't have a news, but I want to geek back something because I've actually been reading a lot less internet.

308
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:15,160
Scott: The only internet I read now, I cut out Reddit and Hacker News.

309
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,257
Scott: I'm only reading Twitter, Google News, Forum, Gmail.

310
00:16:20,277 --> 00:16:21,160
Scott: That's pretty much it now.

311
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:21,461
Rym: Really?

312
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:24,540
Rym: So I love how Twitter is on that list.

313
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,086
Scott: That's right.

314
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,260
Scott: I'm reading my tweets.

315
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:35,000
Rym: I've actually been using Twitter a lot more than I used to lately, which is odd because we originally thought Twitter was stupid and used LaConica instead.

316
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,244
Scott: Well, I didn't think that Twitter was stupid.

317
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:45,020
Scott: I thought that the federated model-- and I still believe that the federated model is the correct model for pretty much all cloud services.

318
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,801
Scott: It's just that.

319
00:16:46,563 --> 00:16:52,877
Scott: for some reason, if you look at history of internets, the cloud model-- the federated cloud model always wins.

320
00:16:52,918 --> 00:16:53,980
Scott: It just takes for fucking ever.

321
00:16:54,262 --> 00:16:55,695
Scott: How long did it take for Jabber to win?

322
00:16:55,756 --> 00:16:56,220
Scott: A decade?

323
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,639
Rym: It only won because Google used it.

324
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,680
Scott: No, but it's federated between Google and AOL.

325
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,565
Rym: Oh, I know, I know.

326
00:17:03,786 --> 00:17:06,460
Rym: But it only even worked because Google owned it and forced it.

327
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,579
Scott: But the fact that it was federated helped it work.

328
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:15,980
Rym: Ah, but Twitter itself being federated would only hurt Twitter's monetization model.

329
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:16,501
Scott: Of course.

330
00:17:17,082 --> 00:17:26,920
Scott: But if another federated Twitter-alike was around, sort of like AIM was around and Google Talk was around, Google Talk was federated and AIM wasn't.

331
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:33,020
Scott: And then eventually, okay, they both get the federated going on and then, boom, everyone's federated.

332
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:33,999
Rym: But you need critical mass.

333
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,264
Scott: Of course you need critical mass.

334
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:39,260
Scott: That's why I say it takes forever, but it seems to eventually win most of the time.

335
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:41,251
Rym: Of course, LaConica died.

336
00:17:41,271 --> 00:17:42,860
Scott: It turned into StatusNet.

337
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,410
Scott: LaConica's problem was not its federatedness.

338
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:47,720
Scott: Its problem was the actual software.

339
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,459
Scott: They had a goal of making it easy to install, like WordPress.

340
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,280
Scott: And if they actually had achieved that goal, it would have actually probably, I think, been extremely successful.

341
00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:00,340
Scott: Their problem was is that setting that shit up, it was so broken and hacky and crashy and it was awful.

342
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,877
Scott: It probably still is a piece of shit.

343
00:18:01,938 --> 00:18:02,120
Scott: Anyway.

344
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,220
Rym: We ran an official FRC LaConica server for a while.

345
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:05,581
Rym: We did.

346
00:18:05,621 --> 00:18:13,180
Scott: If someone wrote a federated microblogging service or whatever you want to call it, I would definitely run it if it didn't suck like LaConica, Identica does.

347
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,180
Scott: Well, now it's StatusNet.

348
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:15,923
Scott: Sure, whatever.

349
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:17,819
Scott: I could even write one if I wanted to.

350
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:25,180
Scott: Anyway, right, so I started using, man, we're going all the way, huge tangent there.

351
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,420
Scott: I started using the Amazon Cloud Music Play thingy, just like you're using the Google one, right?

352
00:18:30,683 --> 00:18:31,699
Rym: I've used the Amazon one, too.

353
00:18:32,021 --> 00:18:32,403
Scott: Oh, have you?

354
00:18:32,424 --> 00:18:32,726
Scott: Okay.

355
00:18:32,948 --> 00:18:34,560
Scott: So the Amazon one came out with this thing.

356
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:43,307
Scott: You pay, I love annual pricing, 25 bucks a year gets you a ridiculous amount of storage space and 250,000 songs, right?

357
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,680
Rym: Now that's double what I pay for Flickr.

358
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,954
Scott: I only have like 7,000 songs, so this is awesome.

359
00:18:52,061 --> 00:18:53,319
Scott: I don't know how many songs I have.

360
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:58,280
Scott: That storage space actually only counts for the Amazon Cloud Drive.

361
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:06,420
Scott: So if you upload, say, a song, a legitimate song that's like 10 megabytes, that just counts as a song, even if you upload it, right?

362
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:18,800
Scott: We're not talking about, you know, and it will match songs, so if it sees a song you have and it matches a song in the Amazon MP3 library, they just give you a 256 kilobit version of that song, unless yours is better, and then you don't actually upload.

363
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,960
Rym: I was about to say, unless yours is better is very important.

364
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:29,880
Scott: Right, and you don't have to actually upload yours, they just give you one, but that only counts as a song, even if you're uploading.

365
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:34,220
Scott: It only counts as one song, it counts as zero bits in the storage space.

366
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:39,820
Rym: So what if I upload a 10 million hour Stag in a Graphic WAV file?

367
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,040
Scott: They don't actually allow uploading in WAV files.

368
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:42,797
Rym: Alright, MP3.

369
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:43,619
Scott: They allow that.

370
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,028
Rym: Alright, so I upload a 100 terabyte MP3 file.

371
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,499
Scott: It has to actually be a song.

372
00:19:48,206 --> 00:19:48,719
Rym: It's a song.

373
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,040
Scott: The importer thing sort of detects whether it's a song.

374
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,258
Rym: Yeah, you know what, so it has an MP3 header?

375
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,897
Scott: It'll probably let it through, but it was actually pretty intelligent in terms of saying, "Oh shit, that's a podcast, that's a song, that's a podcast, that's a

376
00:19:59,938 --> 00:20:00,179
Scott: song.".

377
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:00,555
Scott: It knew.

378
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:03,160
Rym: Oh, so it doesn't let you upload podcasts?

379
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,856
Scott: I mean, it did accidentally upload a bunch of podcasts, because it's not that smart, but another time it actually said, "Oh, those are

380
00:20:09,896 --> 00:20:10,360
Scott: podcasts.".

381
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:16,760
Scott: I think the difference was, is when I uploaded just a folder of MP3s by saying browse, check this folder out, it uploaded podcasts.

382
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:21,610
Scott: But when I said, "Hey, look through my iTunes library and upload that shit," then it recognized what-.

383
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:23,600
Rym: Ah, that makes sense.

384
00:20:25,566 --> 00:20:29,040
Scott: So I'm using this thing, and it's got a lot of good stuff to it, right?

385
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,458
Scott: So the good stuff is, number one, there's three components.

386
00:20:33,741 --> 00:20:36,860
Scott: There's the downloader, the uploader, the importer, and the player.

387
00:20:37,641 --> 00:20:39,920
Scott: So the downloader has always been amazing.

388
00:20:40,564 --> 00:20:42,120
Scott: You couldn't really improve the downloader.

389
00:20:42,564 --> 00:20:43,140
Scott: It's amazing.

390
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,140
Scott: It's the same one that you use if you buy music on Amazon, right, legitimately.

391
00:20:47,902 --> 00:20:59,200
Scott: It opens up this little program, downloads the MP3s from Amazon really quickly, and then automatically inserts them into your iTunes or Windows Media Player, or whatever it is that you use, with all the exact metadata, and it's awesome.

392
00:20:59,621 --> 00:21:06,180
Scott: And the thing is, with this, you could upload things into your cloud player, and then download them with the same downloader.

393
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:12,360
Scott: So you can go to another computer, get the Amazon downloader, and download your own stuff that you just uploaded.

394
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,940
Rym: See, that's the thing I can't do, because I use Spotify a lot right now, and I pay for the premium Spotify.

395
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,140
Scott: I stopped paying for Spotify, but I still use the free Spotify for stuff that's on Spotify.

396
00:21:21,341 --> 00:21:25,160
Rym: I pay for it because I use the playlist generation for road trips and things.

397
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,002
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

398
00:21:26,062 --> 00:21:30,280
Scott: Anyway, so the cloud player is not the best.

399
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,000
Scott: It does a very good job of, here's all your music.

400
00:21:33,141 --> 00:21:38,900
Scott: You can access it on your phone or your computer, and stream it just perfectly, or download it, or whatever.

401
00:21:39,743 --> 00:21:40,980
Scott: And in that respect, it is great.

402
00:21:41,322 --> 00:21:45,420
Scott: And you can search your music, and you can organize playlists, and in that respect, it's great.

403
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:50,940
Scott: The problem is, it doesn't really let you edit metadata or organize, other than making playlists.

404
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,240
Scott: So you basically have this gigantic list of all the songs.

405
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,519
Rym: Not even by album.

406
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,360
Scott: You can sort by album, kinda.

407
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,799
Scott: You gotta search, really, is your only resort, mostly.

408
00:22:01,181 --> 00:22:09,500
Scott: Yeah, that's where Spotify- I mean, you can click the album button, and you'll get this screen full of a million squares with album covers, most of which are not actually album covers, just like Amazon logos.

409
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:14,580
Rym: Yeah, I mean, honestly, Google Play, that kind of whole thing, I only use Google Listen for podcasts.

410
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,119
Scott: Google Listen's dying, I heard.

411
00:22:16,721 --> 00:22:18,798
Rym: Yeah, I was being pulled into- They're closing it out.

412
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:19,340
Rym: Yeah.

413
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:25,200
Scott: Anyway, and the third part is the importer, which is how you take music you have and put it into the thing, right?

414
00:22:25,642 --> 00:22:26,900
Scott: So, it's good and bad.

415
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:31,480
Scott: It's good in that you can point it at your music, and it uploads it relatively quickly.

416
00:22:31,581 --> 00:22:33,780
Scott: It's bad because it's kinda glitchy and buggy.

417
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:41,040
Scott: Like, I told it to upload a folder of stuff, and, like, for example, it's trying to upload the Matt Cross Complete soundtrack, right?

418
00:22:41,601 --> 00:22:48,419
Scott: Only three of those songs have English titles, the rest have Unicode Japanese titles, and it uploaded just those three songs, it ignored the rest.

419
00:22:49,226 --> 00:22:49,311
Rym: Ugh.

420
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,351
Scott: And I was like,

421
00:22:50,515 --> 00:22:50,699
Scott: "What?".

422
00:22:50,881 --> 00:22:53,040
Scott: And I emailed them, and I guess they're working on it, right?

423
00:22:53,500 --> 00:23:05,920
Scott: Another time, like, I uploaded one folder, and it slowly but assuredly uploaded the whole folder, and then I uploaded this other folder, and it sort of got in an infinite loop of, you know, checking up, checking the files without ever actually uploading anything, and it did that overnight.

424
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,552
Scott: And I'm like, "Whoa, okay,

425
00:23:07,612 --> 00:23:07,935
Scott: whatever.".

426
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:12,700
Scott: But then, that was just telling it, you know, to browse for a folder.

427
00:23:13,281 --> 00:23:15,460
Scott: I started a thing where I said, "Look at my iTunes,".

428
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:21,818
Scott: because what it is is I just dragged all my music into iTunes, and then I said, "Amazon importer, look at iTunes and upload everything you

429
00:23:21,878 --> 00:23:22,059
Scott: see.".

430
00:23:22,662 --> 00:23:28,100
Scott: And that seemed to work relatively well, and was actually seeing more of the non-English music.

431
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,559
Scott: So I recommend using that mode.

432
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:39,639
Scott: But yeah, as for how it compares to the Google or the iTunes match, or any of those things, I'm not too sure, because I haven't really used those that much.

433
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:56,140
Scott: But the price is right, you know, 25 bucks a year, that's not too bad, especially since it's, you know, in terms of the number of songs, 250,000 songs, and then you get like 50 gigs, like a lot of gigs of just storage space.

434
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,619
Scott: that is not, the songs don't count against that, that's pretty great.

435
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:11,699
Scott: So I recommend trying out the free versions of all three, the Apple One, iCloud, Google Music, and Amazon Music, to figure out which one you like the most, and then pick one.

436
00:24:12,082 --> 00:24:21,410
Rym: And of them, honestly, I still just use Spotify, because the metadata is super good in Spotify, and that is the main thing.

437
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:31,299
Rym: I use that music service for now, because I don't listen to music idly, like I never listen to music in the background, I listen to music as an activity in and of itself.

438
00:24:32,281 --> 00:24:36,699
Rym: Or driving, I will listen to it in the background, that's the only time, and I don't drive that often anymore.

439
00:24:37,623 --> 00:24:45,840
Rym: Like in the subway, I'm not going to listen to music, I'll listen to words, or read, or wear earplugs or something, because if I'm not giving it my whole attention, it feels like it's a waste.

440
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,078
Rym: But that's me.

441
00:24:47,661 --> 00:24:51,440
Scott: I'm with you, I mostly listen to music with a mostly full attention.

442
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,539
Scott: Like, I might have music on while doing dishes, and you might say, "Oh, that's background music,".

443
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,620
Scott: but actually, the dishes are the secondary activity, not the music.

444
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,132
Scott: So yeah.

445
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,980
Rym: But anyway, things of the day!

446
00:25:10,723 --> 00:25:12,000
Rym: So, Homestuck.

447
00:25:12,902 --> 00:25:16,420
Scott: Oh boy, woah woah, are you sure you want to talk about this on Monday?

448
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,799
Scott: So, Homestuck is the thing- You sure you want to talk about this at all?

449
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:20,920
Rym: On the internet.

450
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:21,430
Scott: Yeah.

451
00:25:22,448 --> 00:25:23,079
Scott: You could say that.

452
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:37,339
Rym: It is either drivel, or it is the first thing that Scott and I are officially too old to understand, the kids who are into Homestuck are to us what we were to the people older than us.

453
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,019
Scott: You forgot possibility number three.

454
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,980
Rym: That the person who made it is crazy?

455
00:25:41,285 --> 00:25:42,200
Scott: No, all of the above.

456
00:25:43,885 --> 00:25:45,180
Rym: I don't like Homestuck.

457
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:55,198
Rym: I tried to read it, I read thousands of these panels, and it actually would have been okay were it not for the fact that for almost all these panels, there's all this text.

458
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:01,300
Rym: And the text reads like that crazy guy who lectured at Open Everything many years ago.

459
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:04,480
Scott: The only thing that I don't like about it- What the fuck was that guy's name?

460
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,459
Scott: Is that it's incomprehensible.

461
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:22,100
Scott: You look at it, it's just a whole pile of gobbledygook, and it would take so much, it hurts literally my eyes and brain to try to look at it and figure it out, like neon colored text in a white background, and it's not even English, it's like, "Hargoblarga doobadoo," and I'm like, I can't even bother to, I can't go through with it.

462
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:37,420
Rym: The strips themselves are fairly artistic, and that's an only story as far as I can tell, but those words read like something that came out of the mind of a disturbed, it's like lost without the cognitive levels that you get from one.

463
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,760
Scott: I didn't interview the Homestuck guy.

464
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,840
Rym: See, I start to ramble and just kind of go off into nowhere.

465
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,699
Scott: All right, so anyway, why is this your thing of the day?

466
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:57,040
Rym: So someone made a video that is just the first three years worth of Homestuck panels, none of these words that go off into gibberish no man's land, in a movie.

467
00:26:58,161 --> 00:27:17,620
Rym: And it's actually, in my opinion, pretty good in and of itself because it's interesting, and it gives you these sort of vignettes, or you'll see disturbing images or things or love stories, but you can't quite interpret them, so it gives the same experience as someone like me trying to read Homestuck without having to read that bullshit.

468
00:27:17,960 --> 00:28:02,955
Scott: Yeah, I can sort of now tell, I watched this video, and I obviously can't tell you the plot of Homestuck, but I could sort of figure out, like, okay, now that it's going by really quickly, and I just see pictures, obviously I don't know any details, but I can see that these different kids, mostly this kid, but also other kids, and they're sort of communicating with each other over some internets, and some of them are in dark places, some of them are in light places, and some of them are doing things, and weird computer game-like things are happening to all of them, and at some point the candy corn horn trolls appear that I see cosplaying at all the conventions, and there's sort of battles occurring, so there's some sort of space battle with these trolls, and these kids are involved who only talk to each other on the internet, and at least don't meet up.

469
00:28:03,336 --> 00:28:09,040
Scott: within this video, at least not any panel I could see, and that's sort of what's going on.

470
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:16,284
Rym: This gives you these sort of, like, emotional flashes of what Homestuck could really be about, and it seems cool.

471
00:28:16,344 --> 00:28:25,399
Rym: The thing is, this reminds me of when I saw a music video to the Utena movie many years ago, or to a Shematic Princess to anime many years ago.

472
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,099
Scott: Shematic Princess, whoa, I remember that video!

473
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,220
Scott: Let's do a Wednesday in Shematic Princess, go get the disc.

474
00:28:32,643 --> 00:28:33,719
Rym: I watched it a few years ago.

475
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,657
Scott: I've never watched it.

476
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:35,689
Scott: Really?

477
00:28:35,709 --> 00:28:36,560
Rym: It's actually not that bad.

478
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,799
Scott: Everyone had it lying on the floor, and I was like, nope.

479
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:53,979
Rym: Shematic Princess and the Utena movie, I watched these music videos, and I was like, if these music videos are any indication of what these movies are like, or OAV in the case of Shematic Princess, this is going to be the best thing ever, and then I watched the things the music videos were based on,

480
00:28:55,046 --> 00:28:55,292
Scott: not

481
00:28:55,374 --> 00:28:55,600
Rym: Monika.

482
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,540
Rym: Should have just watched the music video.

483
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,759
Scott: Not Monika levels.

484
00:28:59,702 --> 00:29:01,600
Rym: So, this does that to Homestuck.

485
00:29:02,581 --> 00:29:09,760
Rym: The reason I make it the thing of the day is that everyone should watch it, because you will know enough about Homestuck to not need to know more.

486
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,420
Scott: It's only five minutes of your life, right?

487
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:18,700
Scott: It's not like, you know, the amount of time it takes is a worthwhile investment for this thing that is so ridiculously popular.

488
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:24,560
Rym: Now, you say it's so ridiculously popular, and there is a perception.

489
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:34,720
Rym: I was talking to someone like six or seven months ago, and they said something to the effect of, you go on and on about how popular My Little Pony is, or Venture Brothers is, or all these things.

490
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,871
Rym: Homestuck is just as popular.

491
00:29:36,992 --> 00:29:38,180
Rym: Nobody talks about that.

492
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:44,750
Rym: So, I did a little bit of internet forensics, because this video, as great as it is, and it was uploaded in May, doesn't even have 10,000 views.

493
00:29:45,881 --> 00:29:46,893
Scott: Well, why would this video have 10,000 views?

494
00:29:47,722 --> 00:29:49,380
Scott: Homestuck people are on Tumblr.

495
00:29:50,683 --> 00:29:53,440
Rym: Yeah, Tumblr, it's the same people in a circle, jerk.

496
00:29:53,900 --> 00:30:00,580
Rym: I went around, and there are fan works related to Homestuck, and fan stuff related to Homestuck.

497
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,096
Scott: Tons of it.

498
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:21,760
Rym: But I did things where I'd Google for a certain Homestuck something mashup, and then Pony something mashup, Venture Brothers something mashup, and I feel like Homestuck, while popular, is not nearly as popular as it is easy to think it is if you are someone who uses Tumblr and goes to conventions.

499
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,160
Scott: I think it's just the traffic to the Homestuck site is off the charts, right?

500
00:30:29,243 --> 00:30:30,247
Rym: What numbers do you have?

501
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:33,440
Rym: We don't have the third-party analytic measures.

502
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,039
Scott: I've read articles about how big the traffic is.

503
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,499
Rym: Yeah, but compare it to Penny Arcade.

504
00:30:38,365 --> 00:30:39,540
Scott: I don't know how it is compared to Penny Arcade.

505
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,660
Rym: Or, I don't know, Johnny Wander even.

506
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,037
Scott: I think it's bigger than that.

507
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:55,200
Scott: But it's basically, you just have this tremendous number of people just mostly hammering this site, and then, you know, it doesn't, it has a lot of, it's very sort of like this insular thing.

508
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:58,680
Scott: Like, you know, everyone talks about like Harry Potter fan fiction or something like that, right?

509
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,199
Scott: And that's pretty big, there's a lot of Harry Potter fan fictions out there.

510
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:10,800
Scott: But no one of them is like ridiculously trafficked, or, and the community that is writing and reading these is not a broad spreading community that's going to bust out, right?

511
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:19,580
Scott: Not like the pony community knows how to bring the ponies into everyday things, you know, to spread to the non-pony people, to spread over the whole internet, to branch out.

512
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:23,240
Scott: So that, and no matter where you are on the internet, you'll fall into pony at some point.

513
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:29,760
Scott: Whereas, you can go all over the internet in normal places, you know, like Reddits and whatnot, and never fall into Homestuck.

514
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,960
Scott: But you can't avoid, say, pony, because, you know, the way in which it is used.

515
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,900
Scott: Somebody should research this, Alex Levitt.

516
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,020
Rym: Well, you know, we did that panel where we kind of talked about this.

517
00:31:39,402 --> 00:31:41,459
Rym: I want to expand that panel and add Homestuck to it.

518
00:31:41,721 --> 00:31:42,060
Scott: Yeah, anyway.

519
00:31:42,541 --> 00:31:43,280
Rym: Anyway, this is my thing of the day.

520
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:44,020
Scott: I have a thing of the day too.

521
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,299
Rym: This thing is pretty good, and you should watch it.

522
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,539
Scott: Yeah, okay, it's okay.

523
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,200
Scott: So, you know Reggie Watts, fuck shit stack.

524
00:31:51,102 --> 00:31:51,678
Scott: The awesome guy.

525
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,720
Scott: That's a pretty good song.

526
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,460
Scott: So this is actually an old video, but I've never seen it, and whatever.

527
00:31:56,961 --> 00:32:00,760
Scott: It's actually from November 2011, so nah, it's almost a year old.

528
00:32:01,322 --> 00:32:05,956
Scott: He was the performer, the final performer, on the Pop Tech 2011 stage, right?

529
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:13,060
Scott: So in this performance, which is 30 minutes long, but well worth watching for the entire 30 minutes, right?

530
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:21,580
Scott: He does a lot of awesome music, and he uses like a, you know, a sampling machine and a microphone to like mix his own beatboxing together, right?

531
00:32:22,542 --> 00:32:32,880
Scott: But mostly, sort of what he's doing is, he's basically making fun of all those typical inspiring tech conference speeches.

532
00:32:34,461 --> 00:32:36,366
Scott: And it's just the way he is like.

533
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:41,680
Scott: lambasting and satiring them is so great, because whatever.

534
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,840
Rym: I've usually heard that word pronounced lambast.

535
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,940
Scott: Lambast, okay, whatever.

536
00:32:46,221 --> 00:32:46,540
Scott: I don't know.

537
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:48,239
Scott: I like bass because it's more like a turkey.

538
00:32:48,762 --> 00:32:49,940
Rym: Well, you're lambasting.

539
00:32:50,085 --> 00:32:50,519
Scott: Right, exactly.

540
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,019
Scott: It sounds, you know, even if it's wrong, which it could be, because I don't know.

541
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,020
Scott: It's sort of like, you know, if you're, you know, basting sounds more like an attack.

542
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,300
Scott: You know, you're squirting meat juice on them.

543
00:33:01,403 --> 00:33:05,260
Scott: Anyway, whereas basting, it's like, okay, you've basted me.

544
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,659
Scott: What is, is it like bastarding?

545
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,200
Scott: It's like, it doesn't sound like the right verb.

546
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:28,700
Scott: Anyway, but yeah, if you have seen like those sort of stereotypical, like when some like web designer gives an inspiring speech at the tech conference, you know, with all those buzzwords and, you know, vision and, you know, that kind of, you know, highfalutin kind of, you know, reach for the stars kind of bullshit.

547
00:33:29,421 --> 00:33:34,520
Scott: To see someone tear that apart the way that I always, I always try to tear it apart in quite a literal direct way.

548
00:33:34,601 --> 00:33:36,220
Scott: Like, yeah, that's just a bunch of bullshit.

549
00:33:36,842 --> 00:33:39,535
Scott: But to see someone tear it apart in this way is, is poetic.

550
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:43,059
Scott: And the music is awesome too.

551
00:33:43,202 --> 00:33:43,839
Scott: So do not miss.

552
00:33:44,764 --> 00:33:46,620
Rym: The music in that Homestuck thing is actually pretty good.

553
00:33:46,841 --> 00:33:47,500
Rym: I wonder how much.

554
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,420
Scott: Is it music from Homestuck or is it just a music that someone put on it?

555
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,538
Rym: It's a music someone put on it.

556
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,519
Rym: But that song won.

557
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,560
Scott: Does Homestuck have music?

558
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,200
Scott: I mean, I'm sure.

559
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,400
Rym: As far as I can tell.

560
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,017
Scott: These flash parts, they could easily.

561
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,660
Rym: I never got to music in all, as far as I read.

562
00:34:01,161 --> 00:34:02,520
Scott: Because they could put music in there.

563
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,920
Scott: Like you get to a flash movie, you push play and music happens.

564
00:34:05,162 --> 00:34:05,420
Scott: I don't know.

565
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:05,900
Rym: I don't know.

566
00:34:06,202 --> 00:34:07,516
Rym: I never got to music in anything.

567
00:34:07,557 --> 00:34:07,820
Rym: I read.

568
00:34:08,049 --> 00:34:08,219
Rym: Okay.

569
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:15,100
Rym: But that song reeks of the song someone uses to make a super serial anime music video.

570
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:24,817
Rym: So in the meta moment book club book, the man who was Thursday, a book that is over a hundred years old.

571
00:34:25,525 --> 00:34:26,360
Scott: So it's free legally.

572
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:27,880
Scott: It's about police and anarchists.

573
00:34:28,281 --> 00:34:33,429
Rym: And I bought the Kindle version and seeing what other people have highlighted in this book.

574
00:34:33,962 --> 00:34:35,418
Scott: Oh, you actually don't turn that shit off.

575
00:34:35,784 --> 00:34:36,579
Rym: I let it be there.

576
00:34:36,822 --> 00:34:37,757
Scott: I turn that shit off.

577
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,100
Rym: It's interesting to see what people highlighted.

578
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,880
Scott: Oh, you have the legal Kindle version.

579
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:42,237
Scott: Yes.

580
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:44,319
Scott: Oh, see, I never, I never pay.

581
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,360
Rym: It was like a dollar ninety nine.

582
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:53,040
Scott: I actually paid for the paper, uh, penguin books edition because number one, the penguin classics always have fancy shit in them.

583
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,719
Scott: But two, the book cover was just so good.

584
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,399
Scott: I wanted to reward whoever the cover artist with whatever pennies and royalties they get.

585
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:07,160
Scott: So, uh, I recommend even you should read it for free probably because most people don't have five bucks to just waste on a free book.

586
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:18,335
Scott: You could spend that on another book like next book club book, but go to Amazon and look at the Oxford, you know, uh, not Oxford, penguin classics edition of The Man Who Was Thursday.

587
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,279
Scott: And look at that cover.

588
00:35:19,604 --> 00:35:20,339
Scott: That is the cover.

589
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:27,898
Rym: The book's OK, but I got to say, it reminds me of literally this is something a middle school teacher makes you read and write an essay on.

590
00:35:29,449 --> 00:35:29,700
Scott: Maybe.

591
00:35:30,182 --> 00:35:30,446
Scott: I haven't.

592
00:35:30,648 --> 00:35:31,540
Scott: I've only read two chapters.

593
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,760
Rym: Oh, you haven't even gotten to anything yet.

594
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:37,080
Scott: I stopped and started reading comics because the comics are piling quite high.

595
00:35:37,663 --> 00:35:39,000
Scott: They're like maybe up to my head.

596
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,406
Scott: It was Thursday.

597
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,900
Rym: It takes like a day to read.

598
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,727
Scott: Which day am I going to choose for reading?

599
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:46,340
Scott: Thursday on Thursday?

600
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,617
Scott: I'm going to be on the Atomic Tribute War 9000 podcast.

601
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:57,640
Scott: Oh, well, Friday, Phil and Cher coming over, which is going to be aired some weeks later than that, maybe during the PAX week.

602
00:35:57,741 --> 00:35:58,958
Scott: So that'll give you something to listen to.

603
00:35:59,362 --> 00:36:01,398
Scott: I don't know how long it takes between recording and playing.

604
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:02,759
Scott: That's up to someone else.

605
00:36:02,941 --> 00:36:05,360
Rym: I was on that a while ago and it was super fun.

606
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,359
Scott: I think it's been my third time on it.

607
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:07,799
Scott: I remember.

608
00:36:07,881 --> 00:36:09,096
Rym: I've only been on it once.

609
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,600
Rym: I've been on more Friday night party lines because you really ignored that.

610
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,820
Rym: But I kept doing it occasionally.

611
00:36:15,341 --> 00:36:17,800
Scott: Um, what are the meta moments do we have?

612
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:21,920
Rym: We're going to be a PAX dev, academia versus reality, psychology, game theory and games.

613
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:26,860
Rym: We're going to be at PAX Prime, short subjects in gaming and the GeekNights board game workshop.

614
00:36:27,362 --> 00:36:27,473
Scott: Nice.

615
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,177
Scott: What are we doing?

616
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,220
Scott: Board game workshop.

617
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:29,958
Rym: We are going to.

618
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,780
Rym: So dive into tabletop gaming.

619
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,300
Rym: Remin Scott, host of GeekNights are here to teach you to play.

620
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,959
Rym: And more importantly, to win.

621
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:44,740
Rym: Agricola is a super popular resource management game with little wooden animals and surprising strategic depth.

622
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:50,600
Rym: Carcassonne is a classic tile laying area control game that teaches you the fundamentals of optimal play and point denial.

623
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:56,018
Rym: We're here to teach you both first the rules, then the strategy and a hands on workshop with no experience necessary.

624
00:36:56,485 --> 00:36:56,616
Scott: Okay.

625
00:36:56,741 --> 00:36:57,874
Rym: Saturday, September 1st, 8 p.m.

626
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,961
Scott: Room 302.

627
00:36:59,961 --> 00:37:01,259
Rym: I think that's in the Red Lion.

628
00:37:01,823 --> 00:37:05,059
Scott: You should subscribe to the newsletter because I'm about to send another one out.

629
00:37:06,062 --> 00:37:08,020
Scott: I remember the milk just said, hey, send the newsletter.

630
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,240
Rym: There's some new videos.

631
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:16,799
Scott: And also, if you want GeekNights to be, if you want to follow us somewhere on the Internet, like we're not on Tumblr right now.

632
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:25,240
Scott: If you want to like, you know, if that's the thing that you want, you know, if you want there to be like a GeekNights Reddit or something, you know, a subreddit that is the GeekNights subreddit.

633
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:28,000
Scott: If you want these things, tell me and I will make them.

634
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:40,020
Scott: If there's some new place on the Internet that just appeared that, you know, is like the new place and they have, you know, ways for us to post things like, you know, to make a GeekNights page or account or whatever that you can follow.

635
00:37:40,822 --> 00:37:43,179
Scott: And you want us to be there because you like using that thing.

636
00:37:43,741 --> 00:37:45,799
Scott: Tell us about the thing and we will go there.

637
00:37:46,741 --> 00:37:53,839
Scott: But for now, we are on Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter, our website, RSS feed, iTunes and email newsletter.

638
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:59,140
Rym: And if you want us to come to a convention because you do do a lot of conventions, there's videos of our stuff at conventions.

639
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:05,260
Rym: Don't ask us to go to a convention if you're just someone who also goes to the convention.

640
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,056
Rym: That doesn't help us.

641
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,122
Rym: We go to.

642
00:38:07,142 --> 00:38:10,800
Rym: we go to so many conventions that we can't just add another one to our schedule willy nilly.

643
00:38:11,481 --> 00:38:16,280
Rym: So if you would like us to appear at a convention, ask the convention to invite us.

644
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,178
Scott: That is correct.

645
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:23,160
Rym: Because if they talk to us, then we can actually sort out the details like hotel or badges.

646
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,819
Scott: when you compensate me for my unpaid vacation day.

647
00:38:27,712 --> 00:38:27,838
Scott: Yes.

648
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:34,800
Scott: But yeah, I mean, if someone pays for everything, even the unpaid vacation day, I will go to any convention.

649
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,840
Scott: I'll go to freaking Alaska, Saskatoon.

650
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,078
Rym: There are conventions I would not bother with.

651
00:38:41,363 --> 00:38:44,360
Rym: I don't know, because I can't even think of them because they're so sad.

652
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:50,020
Rym: I remember a time ago where there were more guests than attendees.

653
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:55,690
Scott: But even if it is so sad, going to it generates the awesome stories, especially if it's far away.

654
00:38:56,521 --> 00:38:56,840
Scott: It depends.

655
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,980
Scott: It's a free adventure.

656
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,319
Scott: I don't give a shit if no one's there.

657
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,599
Scott: That would actually be kind of awesome.

658
00:39:01,243 --> 00:39:01,458
Rym: All right.

659
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:06,120
Rym: So you want to you want to fly to out of somewhere in Idaho, do a convention for one person?

660
00:39:06,641 --> 00:39:12,378
Scott: We would have after we did the panel for that one person and we left because we'd only be there for the one panel.

661
00:39:12,982 --> 00:39:15,920
Scott: We'd have all this free paid for time there in Idaho.

662
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,540
Scott: The potatoes would be so unbelievable.

663
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,799
Rym: You know, I travel a lot for work and I got to say it gets to a point when you're kind of sick of airports.

664
00:39:30,303 --> 00:39:31,418
Scott: I'm sick of airports now.

665
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,040
Scott: What are you talking about?

666
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,040
Rym: Granted, without the TSA, it's so much nicer everywhere else.

667
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,179
Rym: But anyway, we digress.

668
00:39:37,601 --> 00:39:38,759
Scott: Let's actually do a main bit here.

669
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:46,758
Rym: So I go to Starbucks a lot and not, you know, I had a Starbucks card because it actually just gets you free coffee.

670
00:39:47,269 --> 00:39:47,457
Rym: Yeah.

671
00:39:47,882 --> 00:39:49,259
Rym: So there's no reason not to have it.

672
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,818
Scott: I have a reason not to have it.

673
00:39:51,626 --> 00:39:52,360
Rym: You don't go to Starbucks.

674
00:39:52,742 --> 00:39:53,778
Scott: Yeah, you got it.

675
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,739
Scott: I don't think they give you free apple fritters if I buy enough apple fritters.

676
00:39:57,682 --> 00:39:59,640
Rym: No, they give you one free drink of your choice.

677
00:40:00,301 --> 00:40:00,708
Rym: Every 15 times.

678
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,860
Scott: If they had the apple fritter plan, I would sign up.

679
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,600
Scott: But actually, I don't even want that.

680
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,040
Scott: What I want is the bacon, egg and cheese plan at Toasty's.

681
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:08,799
Scott: That's what I want.

682
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,620
Rym: There's nowhere good to get a bagel near my office.

683
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,220
Scott: Right under me is Toasty's.

684
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,900
Scott: They got a big line and the guy even just he remembers everybody.

685
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:18,579
Scott: So I just walk in.

686
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,260
Scott: He's like, you want bacon, egg and cheese and everything bagel?

687
00:40:20,301 --> 00:40:21,000
Scott: I don't even say anything.

688
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,599
Scott: He just makes it.

689
00:40:22,404 --> 00:40:26,598
Scott: And he's like, you know, it's like the one guy, he knows everyone's orders and everyone else makes the stuff.

690
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:37,440
Rym: So I generally I don't like carrying cash because as soon as you know, I've got a 20 as soon as I buy anything, then it's a bunch of wads that get shoved in my pocket.

691
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,499
Scott: You mean my ones that I leave on my desk at home?

692
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:44,555
Rym: And so right now on my desk is easily like $40 in singles.

693
00:40:46,984 --> 00:40:48,198
Scott: Yeah, what I tell you is the five.

694
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:55,279
Scott: What I do is I, you know, I keep the big bills in the wallet and then all the other bills just throw my bag.

695
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,820
Scott: And then when I get home, I just, you know, put the change in the in the change.

696
00:40:58,901 --> 00:41:00,359
Scott: And I put the ones in the one pile.

697
00:41:00,741 --> 00:41:01,660
Rym: My change thing is full.

698
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,755
Rym: There's easily like $500 and change in that thing.

699
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,378
Scott: You gotta cash that shit in.

700
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,120
Rym: Yeah, it's heavy and I got to dump it somewhere.

701
00:41:08,021 --> 00:41:11,980
Rym: So I hate carrying cash and I basically never use cash.

702
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:16,819
Rym: In fact, I avoid any establishment that I can't pay with a credit card at.

703
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:20,240
Rym: Like I almost never use cash.

704
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:24,140
Rym: And when I do use cash, it's always this kind of like filthy experience.

705
00:41:24,602 --> 00:41:25,439
Rym: That's been my whole life.

706
00:41:26,081 --> 00:41:33,940
Scott: I actually use cash just to buy food, mostly like, you know, not the grocery store, but like bacon, egg and cheese or, you know, lunch or something like that.

707
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:43,320
Scott: And then I know that since 99 percent of what I buy with cash is food, I basically look at how much money I took out of the ATM and how much money is still in the wallet.

708
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,240
Scott: And I know how much I spent on food for when I do accounting.

709
00:41:45,823 --> 00:41:51,500
Rym: I get the same thing because my credit card tells me where I bought everything from and conveniently breaks it into categories like food.

710
00:41:52,002 --> 00:41:54,140
Scott: Yeah, a credit card does that as well.

711
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,219
Scott: But I mean, just, you know, food is the only thing I spend cash on.

712
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,519
Rym: I also don't get three percent cash back on cash.

713
00:42:01,246 --> 00:42:01,514
Scott: That's true.

714
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,079
Rym: I hate using cash.

715
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:08,017
Rym: And this is a problem that was solved technologically 20 years ago.

716
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,940
Rym: And yet somehow we've still got these grubby ass one dollar bills.

717
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,160
Scott: Well, you know, I mean, we can replace them with coins or better bills.

718
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:15,844
Scott: That's one.

719
00:42:16,005 --> 00:42:16,853
Scott: Forget about that for now.

720
00:42:16,873 --> 00:42:17,600
Scott: That's not part of the show.

721
00:42:18,382 --> 00:42:24,400
Scott: But the other thing is that cash does have features that other things do not have.

722
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:25,640
Scott: Anonymous.

723
00:42:25,981 --> 00:42:26,316
Rym: Untraceable.

724
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,198
Rym: Non-transactional.

725
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,740
Rym: Bearer related.

726
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,760
Rym: It's like a bearer bond without cash.

727
00:42:33,161 --> 00:42:34,579
Rym: You realize Die Hard couldn't have happened.

728
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:34,846
Rym: Yeah.

729
00:42:35,361 --> 00:42:36,680
Rym: Cash or at least bearer bonds.

730
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:37,240
Rym: And you know what?

731
00:42:37,601 --> 00:42:39,180
Rym: They don't make bearer bonds anymore.

732
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:39,531
Scott: Nope.

733
00:42:40,621 --> 00:42:49,359
Scott: But another feature of cash is just that, you know, anyone can just grab it and use it without having to go through any sort of bureaucracy or other.

734
00:42:49,439 --> 00:42:49,600
Scott: non.

735
00:42:49,722 --> 00:42:49,880
Scott: Right.

736
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:55,399
Scott: If you're like a poor person or a person who was just born or a person who, you know, who is really old and doesn't.

737
00:42:56,381 --> 00:42:58,500
Scott: Anyone can just get cash and immediately use it.

738
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:06,719
Scott: It's like, you know, if I give you like a CD rom, for example, it's useless unless you already have a computer with a CD and the whole thing set up with all the right software.

739
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,519
Scott: It's like this prerequisite.

740
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,340
Scott: There is no prerequisite for cash.

741
00:43:09,683 --> 00:43:11,580
Scott: The dollar bill is the thing.

742
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,260
Scott: It works all on its own.

743
00:43:13,441 --> 00:43:15,260
Scott: You don't need anything else to make it go.

744
00:43:15,461 --> 00:43:15,915
Scott: It just goes.

745
00:43:18,643 --> 00:43:22,620
Rym: But I personally have no need for most of those features most of the time.

746
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:23,599
Scott: I agree.

747
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:34,299
Rym: So the thing, the situation is in a lot of the rest of the world, we have these awesome things like just using your phone as your wallet, not even needing to carry cards, just dupe.

748
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:37,898
Rym: And then, you know, food comes out of the vending machine or dupe and you paid for whatever.

749
00:43:38,603 --> 00:43:42,718
Rym: And somehow we've never gotten that in the US, but I guess I shouldn't say somehow.

750
00:43:43,243 --> 00:43:44,379
Scott: Do we want to discuss the reasons?

751
00:43:45,441 --> 00:43:54,940
Rym: Well, let's talk about why don't we have all these cool things that the rest of the world has in the US in regards to paying for things, because I have one more anecdote.

752
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,520
Rym: The reason I'm pissed off about this is that I was just in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

753
00:43:59,188 --> 00:43:59,619
Rym: And you know what?

754
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:08,760
Rym: When you're sitting in a restaurant, every restaurant, the crappest restaurant you can think of on the table, the little button, if you hit it, your waiter comes immediately.

755
00:44:09,242 --> 00:44:11,620
Rym: Oh, and some restaurants have different buttons.

756
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,519
Rym: One button says as a picture, clear the table.

757
00:44:15,101 --> 00:44:16,879
Rym: Another button is bring me the check.

758
00:44:17,542 --> 00:44:19,559
Rym: Another one is I want to order something else.

759
00:44:20,183 --> 00:44:22,359
Scott: If we make a restaurant, we'll put that shit in there.

760
00:44:22,923 --> 00:44:24,520
Rym: But that's that's a separate thing.

761
00:44:24,581 --> 00:44:25,879
Rym: That's a dark age of restaurants.

762
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,048
Rym: The separate we the the.

763
00:44:28,309 --> 00:44:37,000
Rym: the cool feature was that when it's time to pay, they bring a little credit card machine over and they assume you're splitting the bill and ways, then being the number of people sitting at your table.

764
00:44:37,702 --> 00:44:39,440
Rym: And they already know who ordered what.

765
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:42,040
Rym: So literally, you just toss your credit cards to the person.

766
00:44:42,362 --> 00:44:45,424
Rym: They swipe them all one by one and you all sign your receipts and you walk out.

767
00:44:46,307 --> 00:44:46,519
Rym: Done.

768
00:44:47,361 --> 00:44:53,479
Rym: To this day, no matter where I go, paying for the bill at a restaurant is a gigantic pain in the ass.

769
00:44:54,022 --> 00:44:55,539
Rym: No restaurant will split the bill.

770
00:44:55,721 --> 00:44:57,338
Rym: And in fact, they get pissed off if you ask.

771
00:44:57,882 --> 00:44:58,979
Scott: Well, not all of them.

772
00:44:59,120 --> 00:44:59,596
Scott: Most of them.

773
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:04,344
Scott: But many, you know, it's like they can do it, but it's just easier for them not to.

774
00:45:04,364 --> 00:45:08,260
Scott: And the reason it's easier for them not to is because their point of sale systems are shit, right?

775
00:45:08,341 --> 00:45:10,460
Scott: Because you're expert at point of sale systems.

776
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:11,118
Scott: You're not working at it.

777
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:15,140
Rym: So you want to know why Brazil has these awesome point of sale systems?

778
00:45:15,881 --> 00:45:17,880
Rym: This is how it was explained to me by a native.

779
00:45:18,301 --> 00:45:25,880
Rym: He said that they bring the thing to the table because Brazil is a pretty violent crime ridden country, by and large.

780
00:45:26,481 --> 00:45:32,499
Rym: And credit card cloning was so endemic that everyone refused to let the credit card out of their sight.

781
00:45:33,583 --> 00:45:35,600
Rym: So they had to do the transaction at the table.

782
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:46,279
Rym: But as soon as you had to make that ubiquitous, the transaction thing being at the table, then suddenly there's all these other things you can do because you can guarantee you'll have the thing at the table.

783
00:45:47,421 --> 00:45:51,140
Rym: So I guess we just need there to be a huge crime wave of stolen credit cards.

784
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,960
Scott: I mean, we have this technology in the U.S.

785
00:45:53,020 --> 00:46:00,699
Scott: If you go to the Apple Store or Chipotle, it's like you can check out with just the people walking around with handheld point of sale credit card swipey things.

786
00:46:01,023 --> 00:46:02,460
Scott: And they want you to use those.

787
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,600
Scott: They don't want you to wait in the line.

788
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:10,740
Rym: I'm just sick of the fact that if I have 12 friends, we go to a restaurant, we can't just split the bill and I just pay for what I ate.

789
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,380
Scott: I don't know why the credit card thing is just built into the table.

790
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:26,258
Rym: So the credit card, all these transactions still are reliant upon the credit card, which means that there's a third party taking a cut somewhere along the way.

791
00:46:26,981 --> 00:46:30,100
Rym: Now, they don't take the cut from me, so I don't particularly care.

792
00:46:30,301 --> 00:46:33,040
Scott: And they also give me a bunch of benefits.

793
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,419
Scott: So that cut is actually partially going to me.

794
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,400
Scott: I'm getting a piece of the cut, but why wouldn't I want that?

795
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,820
Rym: They do take the cut from the other side and also restaurant's problem.

796
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:47,280
Rym: They cut out all those other features of cash, like the deniability and the untraceability.

797
00:46:47,802 --> 00:46:51,789
Rym: And that's why cabbies always lie to me and say, oh, credit card machine is broken.

798
00:46:51,829 --> 00:46:52,479
Rym: You pay cash.

799
00:46:52,864 --> 00:46:53,660
Scott: No, it's not.

800
00:46:53,941 --> 00:46:56,659
Scott: You let me pay credit card or I call through on one.

801
00:46:56,946 --> 00:46:57,218
Rym: Yep.

802
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,480
Rym: And the thing is, that's not just a problem in the U.S.

803
00:47:00,641 --> 00:47:02,360
Rym: In Turkey, in Germany.

804
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:03,579
Rym: Oh, my God.

805
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:07,340
Rym: In Germany, every cab I took, the guy would be like, I do not speak English.

806
00:47:07,521 --> 00:47:08,720
Rym: I'm like, whatever, credit card.

807
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,220
Rym: He's like, no card.

808
00:47:10,321 --> 00:47:11,940
Rym: And I just point as his credit card machine.

809
00:47:12,483 --> 00:47:14,499
Rym: And he's like, no work, no work.

810
00:47:14,981 --> 00:47:18,120
Rym: And one time I said, and I quote, you speak English.

811
00:47:18,343 --> 00:47:19,219
Rym: I know you speak it.

812
00:47:19,383 --> 00:47:20,040
Rym: I'm not an idiot.

813
00:47:20,202 --> 00:47:21,219
Rym: I know you're lying to me.

814
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:21,918
Rym: I'm from New York.

815
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,439
Rym: Scan my fucking credit card or I'm calling the police.

816
00:47:25,621 --> 00:47:27,819
Scott: And he scanned my credit card and I was on my way.

817
00:47:30,903 --> 00:47:35,400
Rym: A Turkish guy, when he tried to pull it out of me, I was like, look, I know exactly the scam you're doing.

818
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:35,980
Rym: I'm from New York.

819
00:47:36,041 --> 00:47:37,180
Rym: Don't even try this shit on me.

820
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,438
Rym: I'm going to call the police right now.

821
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:42,040
Rym: And he was like, you got me here.

822
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:42,519
Rym: No tip.

823
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,336
Rym: Don't worry about it.

824
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:44,054
Rym: You win.

825
00:47:46,741 --> 00:47:47,144
Scott: Yeah, we should.

826
00:47:47,184 --> 00:47:49,177
Scott: we should go with like, you know, like.

827
00:47:49,438 --> 00:47:52,779
Scott: I wonder, what do you wear to make someone look at you and say, yeah, New York.

828
00:47:54,365 --> 00:47:56,198
Rym: A middle finger raised at all times.

829
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:57,365
Scott: I already wear that.

830
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,160
Rym: A constant scowl.

831
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:00,999
Scott: I already wear that.

832
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,299
Rym: Particularly scowling at anyone who's slower than you or faster than you.

833
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:05,319
Scott: I already got that down.

834
00:48:07,705 --> 00:48:08,640
Rym: But there's the problem.

835
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:15,160
Rym: Me as a consumer, I have the selfish interest in using a card for everything, because like I said, cash is disgusting.

836
00:48:17,402 --> 00:48:22,240
Rym: But everyone else gets fucked by that because the credit card takes its share from everybody but me.

837
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:32,820
Scott: I do feel the slightest bit bad about the merchants fee, because as much as I like receiving these benefits, you know, like Amazon points, I would rather have money go if I could choose how money was distributed.

838
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:40,100
Scott: I would distribute the money to this nice restaurant that gives me delicious food and not to Visa, which is some nameless company that really isn't necessary.

839
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,107
Rym: But I don't have to deal with.

840
00:48:41,228 --> 00:48:42,540
Rym: I don't want to have to deal with cash.

841
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:43,399
Scott: I do not.

842
00:48:43,901 --> 00:48:48,819
Rym: So there's there's been this movement of all these attempts to make other systems to do this.

843
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:49,637
Scott: Bitcoin lol.

844
00:48:49,961 --> 00:48:56,460
Rym: Yeah, well, Bitcoin actually is being used a lot for mostly illicit bullshit and not for anything legitimate.

845
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,840
Rym: But like Diwala and like Starbucks.

846
00:49:00,881 --> 00:49:01,620
Scott: Well Diwala is not different.

847
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,180
Scott: But yeah, talk about the Starbucks thing.

848
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:08,680
Rym: So the Starbucks thing, basically I put money into a Starbucks thing, but I do it with the credit card.

849
00:49:08,921 --> 00:49:10,979
Scott: So you're paying the merchant fee once, though.

850
00:49:11,305 --> 00:49:11,395
Scott: Yeah.

851
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:21,980
Rym: And I put like a hundred bucks in this Starbucks card, but I don't even need the physical card because there's an app on my phone that displays the the code that I can use to pay so I can pay for Starbucks stuff.

852
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:28,940
Scott: The next version of iOS is actually going to have a single app that any app that basically does that, which is the display a card app.

853
00:49:29,421 --> 00:49:32,680
Scott: All those display a card apps are going to be combined into one app.

854
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,359
Scott: That is the display a card app.

855
00:49:34,684 --> 00:49:35,819
Scott: That is the official Apple one.

856
00:49:36,302 --> 00:49:38,460
Scott: So you won't have to like go make your own app.

857
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:42,600
Rym: Well, the Starbucks one does one thing that it shows the status, like if you're a different status.

858
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,940
Scott: Yeah, no, that's that's all included.

859
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,758
Scott: They're making one app that does all of those.

860
00:49:46,047 --> 00:49:46,240
Scott: Yeah.

861
00:49:46,401 --> 00:49:48,295
Rym: So until there's a company doesn't want to use.

862
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,400
Scott: I mean, you know, but it's the same way that the Apple will reject them because Apple's Apple, right?

863
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,499
Scott: The same way they already have like the magazine app.

864
00:49:54,903 --> 00:49:55,998
Scott: So that's built into iOS.

865
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:00,340
Scott: So if you want to make an app that's a magazine, you don't you make them a magazine thing instead anyway.

866
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:01,291
Rym: Yep.

867
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:05,780
Rym: But the way it works is I just flash my card and no receipt, no nothing.

868
00:50:05,841 --> 00:50:07,199
Rym: Now, it saves them the merchant fees.

869
00:50:07,901 --> 00:50:11,120
Scott: Well, they still to pay a merchant fee when you put the money in the card.

870
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:11,587
Scott: So it's.

871
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:17,360
Rym: Yeah, but yeah, as opposed to a merchant's fee on everybody It's a five dollar card.

872
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,853
Scott: But isn't the merchant fee a percentage of the money you give them?

873
00:50:19,893 --> 00:50:21,000
Scott: so it ends up being the same?

874
00:50:21,723 --> 00:50:22,879
Rym: No, it actually depends.

875
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:27,239
Rym: There are different merchant agreements, partly for different credit cards like Visa versus Amex.

876
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:27,866
Scott: That's true.

877
00:50:27,887 --> 00:50:28,700
Scott: Amex is double.

878
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,760
Scott: If you use an Amex, you're hurting the person you're buying from double.

879
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:36,520
Scott: That's why Amex is accepted in so few or much fewer places than everywhere else.

880
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:44,858
Scott: Because if you have like, you know, if you go into a place that, you know, is you're going to buy like something for a dollar and use an Amex, it's not even worth it for them to sell it to you.

881
00:50:45,261 --> 00:50:45,905
Rym: That happened to me once.

882
00:50:45,965 --> 00:50:46,689
Rym: I didn't have any cash.

883
00:50:46,729 --> 00:50:48,640
Rym: I wanted to buy one D20 a millennium.

884
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:53,720
Rym: And back then, they couldn't turn me down because of the rules about credit cards.

885
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:54,938
Scott: Yeah, the rules have changed, son of a bitch.

886
00:50:55,581 --> 00:50:58,298
Rym: So basically she was like, you know what, just take it.

887
00:50:59,040 --> 00:50:59,206
Scott: Free D20.

888
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:05,397
Rym: Now, theoretically, I just have said I would like to buy every single die.

889
00:51:05,417 --> 00:51:06,360
Rym: you have one by one.

890
00:51:06,661 --> 00:51:08,759
Scott: Yeah, they would have said, all right, you're paying for the rest of them.

891
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,439
Rym: Yeah, I could have come in each day or walk by one, walk out, walk back in.

892
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,107
Scott: Yeah, but if you buy one, walk out, walk back in.

893
00:51:14,147 --> 00:51:14,348
Scott: Right.

894
00:51:14,389 --> 00:51:16,740
Scott: So if it's the emergency is four percent.

895
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:17,262
Scott: Right.

896
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:20,740
Scott: Well, you're paying four percent of a D20 and then you're paying four percent.

897
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:23,169
Rym: No, but it's not always a percent.

898
00:51:23,249 --> 00:51:23,731
Rym: It's all there.

899
00:51:23,912 --> 00:51:25,780
Rym: Sometimes you can have a set fee.

900
00:51:26,182 --> 00:51:27,415
Scott: There's all different ways to do it.

901
00:51:27,435 --> 00:51:27,880
Scott: That's rough.

902
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:32,798
Rym: So Starbucks is probably better off having me put 50 or 100 bucks there every now and then.

903
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,613
Rym: Then every four or 75 is a single.

904
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,139
Scott: They're also better off because now that money is sitting with them.

905
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:41,839
Scott: I gave the money.

906
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:43,858
Scott: You're giving Starbucks a loan.

907
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:48,100
Rym: Which is not that lucrative in the modern era when interest rates are basically zero.

908
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:48,905
Scott: That's true.

909
00:51:48,965 --> 00:51:50,559
Scott: But Starbucks isn't using that money.

910
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:55,280
Scott: See, if you have the money, you would be using it to try to get interest and it would not be very good for you.

911
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:56,229
Scott: But you know what?

912
00:51:56,249 --> 00:51:58,780
Rym: Starbucks is using... Mine's in a money market account or equities.

913
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:02,800
Scott: But Starbucks is using that money in the coffee bean commodities market.

914
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,620
Scott: They're not using that loan money to go try to get interest from a savings account.

915
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:12,120
Scott: So Starbucks, when they get a loan from you, they're better off than you are having a loan from them.

916
00:52:12,502 --> 00:52:14,599
Scott: Because they can actually do something with that money.

917
00:52:17,121 --> 00:52:21,340
Rym: But we've never had the pay for stuff with cell phones that was ubiquitous in the U.S.

918
00:52:21,742 --> 00:52:23,339
Rym: Even though in Asia it's actually pretty common.

919
00:52:25,504 --> 00:52:27,252
Rym: And I feel like it's the way to go.

920
00:52:27,272 --> 00:52:28,960
Rym: I don't even want to carry my stupid wallet.

921
00:52:29,522 --> 00:52:30,240
Scott: Oh, yep, yep.

922
00:52:31,222 --> 00:52:37,072
Scott: So here's the reasons why it has not taken off in the U.S Number one, not everyone has a smartphone.

923
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:39,220
Scott: Even though a lot of people do, not everyone, right?

924
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:44,960
Scott: So if you put this thing on vending machines and stores and all these places, right?

925
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:55,700
Scott: Why would a store go through the trouble of installing this thing that only a fraction of people will use, can use, and only a fraction of those people will use, right?

926
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,347
Scott: You get this chicken and egg situation.

927
00:52:57,427 --> 00:53:00,100
Scott: Even people who have smartphones won't be able to figure it out or bother.

928
00:53:00,482 --> 00:53:03,875
Scott: They've had credit cards that you don't have to swipe, that you just sort of have RFID.

929
00:53:04,196 --> 00:53:05,100
Scott: People don't even use those.

930
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,907
Rym: Well, those were extra stupid because they don't solve you anything.

931
00:53:07,927 --> 00:53:11,737
Rym: You have to carry the same thing and interact with it in the same way.

932
00:53:11,757 --> 00:53:13,100
Rym: Just more glitchily.

933
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:19,519
Scott: And the other thing is, you're going to go through all the effort of signing up for this thing and maybe two places you go actually have it.

934
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:23,994
Scott: And that place can't just, you can maybe get more people to use it.

935
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:25,380
Scott: if a really popular place.

936
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:27,747
Scott: Like let's say McDonald's said you must pay with your phone.

937
00:53:28,109 --> 00:53:28,309
Scott: Yeah.

938
00:53:28,409 --> 00:53:28,911
Scott: OK, great.

939
00:53:28,951 --> 00:53:31,780
Scott: Now all the poor people who go to McDonald's can't go there anymore, period.

940
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,449
Scott: So it's chicken and egg.

941
00:53:33,469 --> 00:53:34,560
Scott: McDonald's would never do that.

942
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:38,860
Rym: The only reason Starbucks was able to pull this off, to get someone like me even to use it and to get it to be used a lot.

943
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,316
Scott: Because the kind of people who go to Starbucks are smartphone kind of people.

944
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:42,502
Rym: Not even that.

945
00:53:42,924 --> 00:53:46,760
Rym: It's simply that they had a rewards program and they just rolled it in.

946
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:52,580
Rym: So it's basically the phone is just a convenience for the people who are already using their reward program.

947
00:53:52,821 --> 00:53:55,628
Scott: I have physical cards for the program if you don't have them.

948
00:53:55,648 --> 00:53:57,112
Rym: Yeah, the app isn't something fancy.

949
00:53:57,132 --> 00:54:00,060
Rym: It literally just displays the code that's on my card.

950
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:00,520
Scott: Yep.

951
00:54:01,203 --> 00:54:03,412
Scott: It doesn't have near field communications or anything.

952
00:54:03,432 --> 00:54:05,420
Rym: But I used it for the first time yesterday.

953
00:54:05,901 --> 00:54:07,247
Rym: I ran like over to Brooklyn.

954
00:54:07,267 --> 00:54:10,200
Rym: I went this long run and I want to carry my wallet because I'm out running.

955
00:54:10,661 --> 00:54:13,632
Rym: But of course I have my phone because you never fucking know.

956
00:54:14,335 --> 00:54:15,620
Rym: So I'm running and I'm thirsty.

957
00:54:17,382 --> 00:54:18,227
Rym: I had the phone.

958
00:54:18,247 --> 00:54:20,459
Rym: I went to Starbucks and bought water with the phone.

959
00:54:20,741 --> 00:54:21,102
Rym: Yeah.

960
00:54:21,543 --> 00:54:26,920
Rym: I love the idea that I want to do a separate show on this, but the guest we're going to have on to do the show couldn't come tonight.

961
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:27,823
Rym: We'll get him some other time.

962
00:54:29,207 --> 00:54:33,420
Rym: There's all this debate about like phones and tablets and the features and all these.

963
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,951
Rym: To me, it's not even a telephone.

964
00:54:35,991 --> 00:54:37,980
Rym: The thing I carry around is not a telephone.

965
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:43,500
Scott: We only call it a phone because, you know, it was a device that came from the cellular phone.

966
00:54:43,901 --> 00:54:48,520
Scott: It's just that we attached the computer to the cellular phone and people stopped using the phone part.

967
00:54:49,043 --> 00:54:51,260
Scott: But we still call it phone because of its history.

968
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:59,220
Rym: But to me, what it should be is this universal data platform that just does pretty much everything I need and is always connected to everything.

969
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,469
Scott: Now, the other reason these things fail in the U.S.

970
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:03,920
Scott: is actually because of geography, right?

971
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:12,000
Scott: In Japan, you know, there's a lot of people there and a lot of stores, you know, or, you know, even in other Asian places, lots of people in lots of places.

972
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:16,593
Scott: But it's physically not geographically large.

973
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:19,200
Scott: There aren't that many square miles to cover.

974
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:19,783
Scott: Right.

975
00:55:19,803 --> 00:55:22,237
Scott: So even though it's not a cell tower situation.

976
00:55:22,659 --> 00:55:22,860
Scott: Right.

977
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:33,860
Scott: Think about how many you have to set up, how many you have to make to deploy this kind of system with any kind of, you know, breath that will actually catch on in the U.S.

978
00:55:34,281 --> 00:55:34,542
Scott: Right.

979
00:55:34,843 --> 00:55:38,819
Scott: If you want to try something out, I mean, like mini disk was successful in Japan.

980
00:55:38,899 --> 00:55:39,080
Scott: Right.

981
00:55:39,421 --> 00:55:45,100
Rym: You know, it's like there's something about, you know, it would have been successful here had it not been for draconian copyright restrictions on its use.

982
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:45,681
Scott: Of course.

983
00:55:45,761 --> 00:55:58,160
Scott: But I'm saying is that, you know, when you have to cover a big stretch of land, even when you're not covering a big stretch of people, you know, the distribution of things, even though you have this Internet connecting that space shouldn't matter.

984
00:55:58,581 --> 00:55:58,761
Scott: Right.

985
00:55:58,781 --> 00:56:05,600
Scott: It's like, OK, so now this gas station in the desert needs to have Internet and it never has and it never will.

986
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:06,422
Scott: Now is dial up.

987
00:56:06,442 --> 00:56:07,163
Scott: It doesn't even work.

988
00:56:07,263 --> 00:56:08,947
Scott: And yeah, cash actually works out there.

989
00:56:09,007 --> 00:56:09,187
Scott: Right.

990
00:56:09,588 --> 00:56:13,716
Scott: So, you know, but when you're, you know, your whole country is basically one city.

991
00:56:13,756 --> 00:56:15,480
Scott: that's all squished up nice and tight.

992
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,703
Scott: Everyone has, you know, Internet.

993
00:56:17,883 --> 00:56:18,424
Scott: You're all good.

994
00:56:18,765 --> 00:56:19,487
Scott: You don't have to worry.

995
00:56:19,507 --> 00:56:20,910
Scott: So the geography of the

996
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:21,250
Scott: U.S.,

997
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:25,960
Scott: even though our population is low compared to a lot of these people and our population density is low.

998
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:30,049
Scott: How much intensity being low actually hurts when more people are in a smaller space?

999
00:56:30,069 --> 00:56:34,900
Scott: You can all get them to all adapt onto this new system and, you know, get the thing to spread more.

1000
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:40,692
Scott: It's like the same way that like an actual virus, if everyone's living all packed in, the virus will infect everyone real quick.

1001
00:56:41,032 --> 00:56:44,720
Scott: But if everyone's spread out, the virus has a hard time infecting the people in the boonies.

1002
00:56:45,261 --> 00:56:57,020
Rym: Now, there's also a kind of like even deeper technological hurdle that to this day, it is easier to hand someone a business card than it is to have two smartphones and go boop, because that boop never actually works.

1003
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:00,499
Scott: Well, that's, you know, because everyone has different shit.

1004
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:01,061
Rym: Yup.

1005
00:57:01,262 --> 00:57:03,367
Rym: And with the so forget the tech side.

1006
00:57:03,407 --> 00:57:04,590
Rym: Let's look at the business side.

1007
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:08,740
Rym: The Starbucks thing only works because I already gave my money to Starbucks.

1008
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:13,308
Rym: So I can't have if I have a general purpose app.

1009
00:57:13,689 --> 00:57:16,616
Rym: Now I have to give money to something or tied to a bank account.

1010
00:57:16,656 --> 00:57:18,020
Rym: So there has to be a middleman again.

1011
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:18,861
Rym: Yup.

1012
00:57:19,142 --> 00:57:21,006
Rym: There's no technological way to do that.

1013
00:57:21,066 --> 00:57:21,527
Rym: That's safe.

1014
00:57:21,908 --> 00:57:23,070
Rym: So we need something.

1015
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:24,573
Rym: And who has done that before?

1016
00:57:24,593 --> 00:57:27,980
Rym: A horrible, evil PayPal that I hate, have never used.

1017
00:57:29,321 --> 00:57:30,282
Scott: I use them, but they're evil.

1018
00:57:30,543 --> 00:57:32,106
Rym: I have never had a PayPal account.

1019
00:57:32,206 --> 00:57:32,486
Rym: Nice.

1020
00:57:32,787 --> 00:57:38,637
Rym: I have only ever used them in terms of paying other suckers who have PayPal accounts and they take huge cuts.

1021
00:57:38,677 --> 00:57:39,519
Rym: And there's all these problems.

1022
00:57:39,559 --> 00:57:40,260
Rym: I hate PayPal.

1023
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:48,951
Rym: There's Diwala, which lets me transfer money because remember, the killer app here isn't buying stuff because I have credit cards to do that now.

1024
00:57:49,292 --> 00:57:51,615
Rym: I can't swipe a credit card on Scott and give him money.

1025
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:54,940
Rym: I very often need to give a friend of mine like 10 bucks.

1026
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:03,632
Scott: You know, a lot of people are doing now is you can use, for example, on your phone, I can use like the Chase Bank app and try to give you money.

1027
00:58:04,053 --> 00:58:08,240
Scott: But it's like we have to sit there with our phones typing in all this information and stuff like that.

1028
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:11,694
Rym: I can send money from Chase to an email address and then they can claim it.

1029
00:58:12,075 --> 00:58:13,100
Rym: But even then, that's a pain.

1030
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:13,521
Rym: Yeah.

1031
00:58:13,821 --> 00:58:18,870
Scott: Well, actually, I was at a restaurant recently with some people I had just met that day and I haven't spoken to them since.

1032
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:19,391
Scott: But whatever.

1033
00:58:19,431 --> 00:58:20,513
Scott: It's New York.

1034
00:58:21,094 --> 00:58:22,657
Scott: And we're like they were.

1035
00:58:22,677 --> 00:58:23,218
Scott: they were all these.

1036
00:58:23,418 --> 00:58:24,320
Scott: they were much younger than me.

1037
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:25,623
Scott: And they, you know, had that typical.

1038
00:58:25,683 --> 00:58:26,785
Scott: how do we pay drama.

1039
00:58:27,085 --> 00:58:27,807
Rym: Oh, my God.

1040
00:58:27,947 --> 00:58:28,829
Scott: So I'm just.

1041
00:58:28,869 --> 00:58:31,855
Scott: I was just ignoring it and I was just waiting till whatever they were doing was done.

1042
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:33,879
Scott: And then I was going to take care of my bit and then get out of there.

1043
00:58:33,919 --> 00:58:34,060
Scott: Right.

1044
00:58:34,561 --> 00:58:39,570
Scott: But one of the girls, she had square that little thing where you can accept payments, like if you're in an artist's alley.

1045
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:40,251
Scott: Right.

1046
00:58:40,472 --> 00:58:45,000
Scott: So basically everyone just swiped our credit cards on her phone paying her.

1047
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:46,984
Scott: She paid all these merchant fees through square.

1048
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:47,986
Scott: But that's not my problem.

1049
00:58:48,407 --> 00:58:54,160
Scott: So basically everyone just swiped their credit card on her phone, typed in a number of dollars and she took money from everyone.

1050
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:55,825
Scott: And then she paid for the whole thing with her card.

1051
00:58:55,925 --> 00:58:57,991
Scott: And, you know, but it's like, great.

1052
00:58:58,231 --> 00:59:00,156
Scott: So now someone, you know, has to be a merchant.

1053
00:59:00,397 --> 00:59:01,440
Scott: Everyone has to be a merchant.

1054
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,144
Scott: It's like, no, this is that what this is.

1055
00:59:04,204 --> 00:59:11,856
Scott: It's another one of those cases where, you know, in the olden days, it used to be there was a music producer and then to be music listeners.

1056
00:59:11,916 --> 00:59:14,400
Scott: But now everyone is both producer and listener.

1057
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,724
Scott: This is, you know, this old model is.

1058
00:59:16,744 --> 00:59:22,033
Scott: there are merchants and then there are customers like, no, nowadays everyone's a merchant.

1059
00:59:22,093 --> 00:59:22,995
Scott: It's flattened out.

1060
00:59:23,075 --> 00:59:23,496
Scott: It's not.

1061
00:59:23,656 --> 00:59:25,980
Scott: it doesn't have this to roll system anymore.

1062
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:33,450
Scott: It's everyone does all the roles and you just sort of change this dual view mentality going on and come with something new.

1063
00:59:33,931 --> 00:59:40,760
Scott: The problem with that is that it makes it very hard for any middlemen to exploit, which is why the middlemen constantly fight against this flattening.

1064
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,646
Rym: But also simultaneously, we do still need a middleman.

1065
00:59:44,686 --> 00:59:48,894
Rym: You have to have someone to actually make the money transaction happen.

1066
00:59:48,934 --> 00:59:50,436
Scott: That is correct, because think about it.

1067
00:59:50,477 --> 00:59:52,420
Scott: OK, what are we going to do if we don't have a middleman?

1068
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:55,065
Scott: I have my phone and my phone says how many dollars I have.

1069
00:59:55,085 --> 00:59:57,530
Scott: Your phone says how many dollars you have.

1070
00:59:57,770 --> 00:59:59,634
Scott: And we touch phones and the numbers change.

1071
00:59:59,734 --> 01:00:00,716
Scott: I'll just it's my phone.

1072
01:00:00,736 --> 01:00:02,439
Scott: I'll just hack it and change the number.

1073
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:03,080
Scott: Right.

1074
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:08,270
Scott: No, there has to be some third party that says this is how much money Scott has.

1075
01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:10,935
Scott: And it you know, I can't just go and change the number there.

1076
01:00:10,955 --> 01:00:13,460
Scott: It can't be something that belongs to me or belongs to you.

1077
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:16,307
Scott: It needs to be some trusted third party somehow.

1078
01:00:16,828 --> 01:00:17,049
Scott: Right.

1079
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:20,097
Rym: Well, theoretically, you could do it with a cryptographic.

1080
01:00:20,177 --> 01:00:21,320
Scott: You could do the Bitcoin method.

1081
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,503
Rym: Yes, which has some problems in and of itself.

1082
01:00:24,563 --> 01:00:24,864
Rym: It does.

1083
01:00:24,944 --> 01:00:28,889
Rym: But even there, finances are not simple at all.

1084
01:00:28,929 --> 01:00:37,860
Rym: I mean, I have my checking account, my money market account, my equities, you know, my 401k, all these different sources of money that are more or less liquid.

1085
01:00:38,641 --> 01:00:40,486
Rym: And I have to be able to pull the money out of them.

1086
01:00:40,506 --> 01:00:45,440
Scott: And they're in banks and places where you need to be able to move the money between all the different places you can put money.

1087
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:54,560
Scott: And so imagine if I turn all my money into bitcoins and I spent it as Bitcoin and even if all the restaurants and food places and everywhere took Bitcoin, I want to know I want to buy some stock with Bitcoin.

1088
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:55,862
Scott: I want to put my 401k.

1089
01:00:55,922 --> 01:00:57,284
Scott: I got to pay the doctor with Bitcoin.

1090
01:00:57,325 --> 01:00:58,887
Scott: It's like it's not going to work.

1091
01:00:59,528 --> 01:01:00,290
Scott: It's not going to happen.

1092
01:01:01,011 --> 01:01:06,240
Scott: You need to have some common format of exchange, which cash is still the only one.

1093
01:01:06,581 --> 01:01:08,287
Scott: You know, we already talked about some places.

1094
01:01:08,348 --> 01:01:11,560
Scott: still don't accept credit card, but everyone takes cash.

1095
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:20,360
Rym: And that credit card thing, though, is causing an interesting self-selection in that I personally really don't do business with anyone who only takes cash.

1096
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:22,860
Scott: But what about those really good hole in the wall restaurants?

1097
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:24,323
Rym: Those are the only places.

1098
01:01:24,383 --> 01:01:24,944
Scott: That's right.

1099
01:01:25,025 --> 01:01:30,880
Rym: But if I'm ordering food like I need to carry out, I'm only going to order not even someone who takes credit card, but someone who's on Grubhub.

1100
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:32,986
Rym: I don't have to talk to a person.

1101
01:01:33,087 --> 01:01:33,709
Scott: Me, too.

1102
01:01:34,071 --> 01:01:35,376
Rym: But at a convention even.

1103
01:01:35,396 --> 01:01:36,360
Scott: Except for the Chinese restaurant.

1104
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:40,760
Rym: It's interesting how half the people in the artist's alleys actually can take credit cards these days.

1105
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:41,945
Scott: Like I said, they have square.

1106
01:01:41,965 --> 01:01:42,045
Scott: Yeah.

1107
01:01:42,788 --> 01:01:45,840
Rym: But it's costing them a lot of money to do that relatively.

1108
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:58,780
Rym: But more importantly, it's killing the people who don't have the barrier to entry of smartphone and the square device is pretty high for a lot of poor, like pre-college freshmen in college artists.

1109
01:01:59,441 --> 01:01:59,642
Scott: Yeah.

1110
01:01:59,662 --> 01:02:05,320
Scott: I mean, why can't we just get to the cowboy bebop era or the shadow run era where I have a crutch is basically the same thing.

1111
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:05,701
Scott: Yeah.

1112
01:02:06,707 --> 01:02:09,320
Rym: And shadow runs a little more depressive because they're not.

1113
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,680
Scott: See, you know what I've always been curious about and I'm sure some nerd out there knows this, which is why I'm asking.

1114
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:14,364
Scott: And I don't want to.

1115
01:02:14,545 --> 01:02:16,440
Scott: I could search for it on Google, but I'm not going to bother.

1116
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:17,403
Scott: What are you about to ask?

1117
01:02:17,423 --> 01:02:18,367
Scott: Remember in Star Wars.

1118
01:02:18,668 --> 01:02:18,808
Scott: Right.

1119
01:02:18,828 --> 01:02:19,451
Scott: They have credits.

1120
01:02:19,993 --> 01:02:20,253
Scott: Right.

1121
01:02:20,414 --> 01:02:22,040
Scott: And they paid Lando his credits.

1122
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:26,420
Scott: And you remember he was getting on to the Millennium Falcon when he was leaving, you know, Yavin.

1123
01:02:27,101 --> 01:02:32,140
Scott: And he had like these ammo cases that presumably contained the credits that he was paid with.

1124
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:32,702
Scott: Right.

1125
01:02:33,806 --> 01:02:36,657
Scott: The credits in Star Wars world were physical somehow.

1126
01:02:36,697 --> 01:02:37,179
Scott: They weren't.

1127
01:02:38,081 --> 01:02:38,803
Scott: They're not digital.

1128
01:02:40,911 --> 01:02:41,774
Scott: That's what I'm wondering about.

1129
01:02:41,814 --> 01:02:43,600
Scott: What is what is an actual galactic credit?

1130
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:44,603
Scott: Is it a piece of paper?

1131
01:02:44,684 --> 01:02:45,567
Scott: Is it what is it?

1132
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:47,958
Scott: Because he was carrying those boxes, remember?

1133
01:02:48,219 --> 01:02:48,420
Scott: Yeah.

1134
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:51,309
Scott: And he was like they were loading them onto the ship and you had to do they were.

1135
01:02:51,369 --> 01:02:54,700
Scott: it was heavily implied that those were the credits the rebels paid him with.

1136
01:02:55,721 --> 01:02:56,244
Scott: And he never gave.

1137
01:02:56,264 --> 01:02:57,753
Scott: it didn't seem give those back either.

1138
01:02:58,176 --> 01:02:58,719
Rym: Of course not.

1139
01:03:00,502 --> 01:03:03,820
Scott: I mean, he we worked for them, but he didn't, you know, get the money anyway.

1140
01:03:04,241 --> 01:03:04,925
Rym: Well, you keep that.

1141
01:03:04,965 --> 01:03:07,619
Rym: There's a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow.

1142
01:03:08,421 --> 01:03:13,920
Scott: Well, I think he took the sweat of his bro's sister more than the sweat of his brow.

1143
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,344
Rym: Well, at least we know my little pony.

1144
01:03:16,385 --> 01:03:21,040
Rym: It's bits and then there's pennies and actual coins made of a precious metal of some kind.

1145
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:22,083
Rym: Yeah, probably gold.

1146
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:24,610
Rym: Anyway, I don't know.

1147
01:03:24,931 --> 01:03:28,280
Rym: I feel like we can do a deeper topic on this down the road of kind of the specifics.

1148
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:40,000
Rym: But I just wanted to talk about as an overview, because it it annoys me that in this era, in the 21st century, in the year two thousand, we've invented better solutions and it takes a long time to actually get the solutions adapted.

1149
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,665
Scott: Welcome to all of history.

1150
01:03:41,986 --> 01:03:43,672
Scott: Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone.

1151
01:03:43,712 --> 01:03:46,060
Scott: When did everyone actually start using telephones like crazy?

1152
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:52,159
Rym: Decades later, we cell phones weren't really ubiquitous until we had cell phones.

1153
01:03:52,842 --> 01:03:53,725
Scott: Not everyone really.

1154
01:03:53,785 --> 01:03:56,313
Scott: Not everyone had them until like the mid 2000s, late 2000s, you know?

1155
01:03:58,720 --> 01:03:58,961
Rym: Yeah.

1156
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:04,020
Rym: There was a time when Scott was the only person in the front row crew who had a current working cell phone.

1157
01:04:04,803 --> 01:04:07,139
Rym: When I got mine, that got us up to like three people.

1158
01:04:08,621 --> 01:04:10,650
Scott: And this was in the century.

1159
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:12,097
Scott: It was not in the 90s.

1160
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:19,676
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1161
01:04:19,716 --> 01:04:24,710
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1162
01:04:25,071 --> 01:04:30,110
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

1163
01:04:30,550 --> 01:04:33,037
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1164
01:04:33,177 --> 01:04:37,770
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1165
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:41,306
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1166
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:45,640
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1167
01:04:45,841 --> 01:04:48,730
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
