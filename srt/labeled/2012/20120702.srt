1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,049
Rym: It's Monday July 2nd 2012.

2
00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:12,550
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:17,440
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight hardware lockdown and all that bullshit.

4
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:19,353
Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:25,704 --> 00:00:28,406
Rym: We often say this at the start of the show, but warm today.

6
00:00:29,167 --> 00:00:32,069
Rym: It is warm, but actually even warmer yesterday.

7
00:00:32,089 --> 00:00:38,817
Scott: Ah It's not yet been so warm that I did not want it to be Warmer not at all.

8
00:00:38,857 --> 00:00:49,840
Rym: However, there was a Guy today in fact a 10-minute span yesterday when we were biking up the hill in the Sun with no breeze Back from New Jersey where I would have liked it to be cooler.

9
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,232
Rym: in a zone around my body for about 10 minutes There's.

10
00:00:54,373 --> 00:00:58,025
Scott: I was getting a fruit juice at the juice truck today juice cart.

11
00:00:58,487 --> 00:00:59,370
Rym: and what kind of fruit juice?

12
00:00:59,712 --> 00:01:01,703
Scott: I think it was pineapple orange banana mango.

13
00:01:01,723 --> 00:01:07,865
Scott: Yeah, and There's a guy in front of me and a tourist walks up and says right where's Rockefeller Center?

14
00:01:07,885 --> 00:01:09,591
Scott: and I'm like right behind that fucking building.

15
00:01:10,715 --> 00:01:18,522
Scott: and the guy in front of me is like, ah, thanks cuz I didn't I didn't remember where it was and I was like Okay, and he's like it's pretty warm today.

16
00:01:18,643 --> 00:01:23,390
Scott: and I'm like, yeah, it's pretty warm But I'd rather have be warmer like maybe 120.

17
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,502
Rym: I've had that weird that same kind of conversation with a lot of strangers lately.

18
00:01:26,562 --> 00:01:28,952
Rym: if someone complains about the heat or says something about The heat.

19
00:01:29,053 --> 00:01:31,850
Rym: Yeah, and my response is always I'd like it to be about 10 degrees hotter.

20
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:36,285
Scott: I'm like, I wanted to be about 120 right and the guys like what was the last time you were in 120?

21
00:01:36,285 --> 00:01:38,673
Scott: and I'm like The shower.

22
00:01:38,995 --> 00:01:41,684
Scott: Nah, and he's like, uh, he's like I've been in 120.

23
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:47,487
Scott: It was rough But I was carrying a whole bunch of gear and he was.

24
00:01:47,688 --> 00:01:50,645
Scott: uh I assume he was probably like an India Sun because he was an Indian guy.

25
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:56,894
Scott: So Racist, I'm just saying because India is a warm place It's near the equator.

26
00:01:57,516 --> 00:01:59,202
Rym: I would not terribly enjoy once.

27
00:01:59,262 --> 00:02:01,790
Scott: I assume that that's the place that he was when it was 120.

28
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,099
Rym: I actually prefer about 95.

29
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:05,946
Rym: That's my like go-to zone for heat.

30
00:02:06,468 --> 00:02:15,510
Rym: I'll take 500,000 anyway, so as you all know as I tweeted there was you know, we got an extra second over the weekend.

31
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,195
Rym: We had a leap second now.

32
00:02:17,918 --> 00:02:20,205
Rym: I don't really want to debate the long weekend guys.

33
00:02:20,245 --> 00:02:23,702
Rym: Yeah deep question, man Why could we get that leap second during packs?

34
00:02:24,306 --> 00:02:24,829
Scott: I know right.

35
00:02:25,695 --> 00:02:32,386
Rym: Anyway, so, you know The whether or not we need to do that is up for debate because we live on earth.

36
00:02:32,446 --> 00:02:33,410
Rym: we don't live anywhere else.

37
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,554
Rym: So keep your time.

38
00:02:34,634 --> 00:02:46,008
Rym: It's because in sync with earth in the fact that the earth is slowing down Make sense that we have to update our calendar, but at the same time Leap seconds cause Linux to shit itself.

39
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:51,230
Rym: There are there are numerous kernel bugs in Linux and there's all sorts of different issues.

40
00:02:51,250 --> 00:03:04,907
Rym: But basically if any of you out there have a Linux server, I would highly recommend at some point From today onward reboot it because Some crap happens and you might think oh, this is just tech people being alarmist.

41
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:26,080
Rym: I Personally witnessed such crazy things as threads being spawned But then the kernel thought that they returned from like nano sleep before they started because the kernel was off by exactly a second from the system time in another place because it didn't handle the leap second right and Crazy bullshit happened and I'm.

42
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:34,680
Rym: I will link to you two Examples of this because this is a real problem I actually had to deal with as a computer.

43
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,450
Scott: the problem was very much tied to Java.

44
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:38,917
Scott: I noticed a lot of the fixes.

45
00:03:39,198 --> 00:03:45,468
Scott: Ah, there were two separate sets of problems Related and I know you do Java stuff because I had no problems with my lampsticks.

46
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:52,908
Rym: Yep No, Java itself would have problems with this but independently there were some generic system things that could also go.

47
00:03:52,948 --> 00:03:56,420
Scott: wonder if Java had The problem on Windows or Mac or something.

48
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,989
Rym: I don't know because Windows servers get rebooted all the time.

49
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:10,950
Scott: So Yeah, I mean my my opinion on leap second right is if you want to keep the calendar in sync with the earth Which I think we need to for now.

50
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:18,269
Scott: The reason that you keep the calendar in sync with the earth is so that the seasons line up right with things.

51
00:04:18,531 --> 00:04:24,790
Scott: Yeah, so, you know you can say for example aha It'll always be cold in December right and you know around the Christmas time.

52
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:29,008
Scott: Otherwise if we don't do that, eventually we're gonna have Christmas summer sit.

53
00:04:29,028 --> 00:04:31,190
Rym: you know That happened at several points in our history.

54
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:32,956
Scott: You're gonna have San Diego.

55
00:04:32,976 --> 00:04:34,642
Scott: comic-con is every year in July.

56
00:04:34,662 --> 00:04:35,685
Scott: Oh, why is it snowing?

57
00:04:35,746 --> 00:04:36,026
Scott: Fuck?

58
00:04:36,247 --> 00:04:37,990
Scott: That's why I guess It doesn't snow in San Diego.

59
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:38,664
Rym: That's why we kept.

60
00:04:38,684 --> 00:04:45,786
Rym: you know First we had to leap years and then the rules were every four years, but not every hundred years But yes every 400, right?

61
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,546
Scott: So that's why we have.

62
00:04:47,566 --> 00:04:53,660
Scott: you know If we're gonna keep the calendar we have and keep it in sync with the seasons you got to leap it but the only air.

63
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,534
Scott: so the alternative is either keep doing what we're doing or Metric kind of calendar.

64
00:04:59,554 --> 00:05:00,276
Rym: Yeah, you know what.

65
00:05:00,316 --> 00:05:02,241
Rym: there was a metric calendar, you know what it.

66
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:03,926
Rym: you know, how many people used it?

67
00:05:04,287 --> 00:05:05,049
Rym: one zero.

68
00:05:07,153 --> 00:05:08,518
Rym: It was in France Napoleon era.

69
00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:09,784
Rym: it was all tens.

70
00:05:09,844 --> 00:05:11,150
Rym: It was kind of stupid didn't really work.

71
00:05:11,691 --> 00:05:16,346
Scott: Did you see those trucks that were delivering some sort of alcohol and had a giant Napoleon on the side?

72
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:19,008
Scott: No We piked right past him.

73
00:05:19,592 --> 00:05:20,555
Rym: I guess I wasn't making tension.

74
00:05:20,575 --> 00:05:22,120
Scott: but there's some brand of alcohol and the.

75
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,644
Scott: the label is Napoleon.

76
00:05:23,705 --> 00:05:27,678
Scott: and I wonder like is that the The alcohol that Napoleon liked to drink?

77
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,083
Scott: is it made by him?

78
00:05:29,184 --> 00:05:30,248
Scott: Is it made by you know?

79
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,919
Scott: I'm pretty sure it is it made in the place that he's from.

80
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:34,922
Scott: what's the deal with it?

81
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,946
Rym: Where is Napoleon?

82
00:05:35,986 --> 00:05:37,190
Rym: from France?

83
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,008
Rym: Corsica anyway.

84
00:05:40,612 --> 00:05:43,950
Rym: But you know biking is neither here nor there nor our kernel panic.

85
00:05:44,131 --> 00:05:46,639
Rym: So this is when I was didn't really a kernel panic.

86
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,947
Rym: if it was just panicked that would have been fine.

87
00:05:48,988 --> 00:05:51,342
Rym: if Linux had just Crashed would have been cool.

88
00:05:51,644 --> 00:05:57,922
Rym: But the fact that in Determinate state where threads didn't behave right my god.

89
00:05:58,303 --> 00:06:00,490
Scott: But anyway, I'm going to Corsica.

90
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:06,039
Rym: I'll see you later to talk about some more, you know to have a news bit I had a personal experience recently see.

91
00:06:06,823 --> 00:06:08,210
Rym: almost exactly a week ago.

92
00:06:09,091 --> 00:06:16,550
Rym: I opened a door and I had my cell phone in my pocket and I bumped it against the door in my pocket Normal bump the kind of thing that happens all the time.

93
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,370
Rym: But later I get to work and I pull my phone out.

94
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:23,989
Rym: You know my instinct to look at it for something and I noticed the screen has shattered.

95
00:06:25,712 --> 00:06:26,720
Rym: So I had to go.

96
00:06:26,741 --> 00:06:27,447
Rym: I didn't you know.

97
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:33,086
Rym: I couldn't just get it replaced at the Sprint store because that's not covered by the normal warranty.

98
00:06:33,106 --> 00:06:35,388
Rym: nor is my phone You know new.

99
00:06:36,691 --> 00:06:42,970
Rym: And I didn't want to sign another two-year contract with Sprint because Google Glass and the new iPhone are on the horizon.

100
00:06:43,672 --> 00:06:51,058
Rym: I'm not gonna sign up a two-year contract for the privilege of paying $200 instead of $700 for the next Samsung phone.

101
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,669
Rym: that isn't as good as the phone I've got.

102
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,329
Rym: So I look at my options.

103
00:06:56,372 --> 00:07:02,821
Rym: basically, I found for like a hundred bucks a refurbished Identical version of my phone from some guy was used.

104
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:05,190
Rym: he like refurbished it and sold it on Amazon.

105
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,097
Rym: So I bought it and I activated it.

106
00:07:07,118 --> 00:07:07,579
Rym: and you know what.

107
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:15,693
Rym: right now ice cream sandwich is reinstalling looks fine alright, but I had to go a week without a cell phone and It was rough.

108
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,100
Rym: Yeah, but it's interesting.

109
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,404
Rym: It wasn't rough in the ways.

110
00:07:19,424 --> 00:07:27,230
Rym: I expected I did not feel Withdrawal the way so many articles said I would because the phone is like an extension.

111
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:29,480
Scott: Just rough in that anytime you want to look at it.

112
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:29,701
Scott: You go.

113
00:07:29,862 --> 00:07:30,485
Scott: Ah, it's not there.

114
00:07:30,947 --> 00:07:31,530
Scott: Ah, it's not there.

115
00:07:31,812 --> 00:07:45,605
Rym: I felt like I was missing a sense Like I felt like one of my senses was gone the sense of access external memory and know exactly where I am Geophysically at all times because the day my phone broke I had to bike home.

116
00:07:46,086 --> 00:07:47,330
Rym: All right, I'll bike home.

117
00:07:47,757 --> 00:07:48,430
Rym: I start biking.

118
00:07:48,952 --> 00:07:57,780
Rym: I get just far enough away from work to where we take too long to walk back before the building was closed and Nowhere near a subway station and my rear tire exploded.

119
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,468
Rym: I don't carry a patch kit on me or anything.

120
00:08:00,488 --> 00:08:01,692
Rym: So I'm like fuck All right.

121
00:08:01,753 --> 00:08:04,645
Rym: Well, I'll just look up where a bike shop.

122
00:08:04,746 --> 00:08:07,036
Rym: fuck fuck Start walking.

123
00:08:07,739 --> 00:08:08,804
Rym: I ask everyone I pass.

124
00:08:08,824 --> 00:08:10,170
Rym: Hey, is there a bike shop around here?

125
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,217
Scott: You know, there's one on both sides of the bridge.

126
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:14,464
Rym: So yeah, which bridge?

127
00:08:14,906 --> 00:08:15,990
Scott: the one that you used to get home?

128
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,379
Rym: Yeah, so I couldn't find one.

129
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,150
Rym: So I found one bike shop at the base of the Williamsburg bridge.

130
00:08:21,673 --> 00:08:24,368
Rym: They did not have tires in the size of my bike.

131
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:25,936
Scott: Why didn't you just get a tube?

132
00:08:25,956 --> 00:08:26,740
Scott: you need a tire for?

133
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:32,482
Rym: because the tire was shot a nay This gigantic like wood screw went through it sideways.

134
00:08:32,503 --> 00:08:33,085
Rym: I don't even know how.

135
00:08:33,105 --> 00:08:34,409
Rym: so there was a chunk out of it.

136
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:36,361
Rym: There was no way safe way to ride on that tire.

137
00:08:36,905 --> 00:08:37,710
Rym: tire was fucked.

138
00:08:38,315 --> 00:08:42,697
Rym: so that bike shop couldn't help me and No one could tell me where another bike shop was.

139
00:08:42,717 --> 00:08:52,075
Rym: So I just kept walking north until I hit 14th Street Because I knew there was a bike shop there that I knew could help me and I got my bike fixed And then I biked home.

140
00:08:52,216 --> 00:08:53,241
Scott: I know a bike shop less.

141
00:08:53,462 --> 00:08:55,010
Scott: That's more south than 14th Street.

142
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,298
Scott: You go to bike habitat, which is on Lafayette.

143
00:08:57,479 --> 00:09:00,450
Rym: Yeah, I would have to find that with no phone and apparently I know exactly.

144
00:09:01,122 --> 00:09:01,346
Rym: Now.

145
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:13,188
Rym: yeah I now I know why people ask for directions all the time in New York because I learned that if you ask someone in New York for directions the majority of them unless you're asking for subway directions have no fucking idea.

146
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,316
Rym: Yep They don't know where anything is.

147
00:09:15,357 --> 00:09:18,530
Rym: you ask someone like hey, where's you know, the Empire Staple?

148
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:26,390
Scott: I told you today the guy in front of me was a New Yorker and someone asked him Where's Rockefeller Center and I knew where it was and we were like one block away from it.

149
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,610
Rym: He's like no, but if that person had asked hey, how do I get to the F train?

150
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,414
Rym: They'd be like one block.

151
00:09:30,434 --> 00:09:33,428
Scott: that way maybe the F train was actually right underneath.

152
00:09:33,528 --> 00:09:33,709
Scott: worst.

153
00:09:34,352 --> 00:09:44,463
Rym: But the fact that bike like the other day at Saturday had to bike to the beach again not having my instant Always on always perfect GPS on me huge problem.

154
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,830
Scott: I actually made it to the beach of the map made of paper.

155
00:09:47,031 --> 00:09:50,705
Rym: I don't carry maps made of paper because my phone is so much faster than that.

156
00:09:50,725 --> 00:09:52,090
Scott: It's not much faster than paper.

157
00:09:52,452 --> 00:09:59,321
Rym: Uh, yeah, I think the problem is you're on an iPhone Loads no matter what Scott my phone loads no matter what.

158
00:09:59,462 --> 00:10:03,217
Rym: the whole of New York is cashed and the GPS is Independent of my data plan.

159
00:10:03,257 --> 00:10:05,669
Rym: So even if I'm an airplane mode, I turn it on.

160
00:10:05,992 --> 00:10:07,769
Rym: It shows me exactly where I am on the map.

161
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:13,220
Scott: Uh-huh, like within five seconds of turning my screen on five seconds I could do the map whole map in less than five seconds.

162
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:13,621
Scott: Really?

163
00:10:13,642 --> 00:10:13,943
Rym: Really?

164
00:10:14,023 --> 00:10:15,108
Rym: All right, pull your map out.

165
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:18,433
Rym: go Three four.

166
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:21,304
Scott: if I had the map I would have been out and back in our.

167
00:10:21,585 --> 00:10:25,621
Rym: I highly doubt that Having having that phone on me all the time.

168
00:10:25,641 --> 00:10:27,569
Scott: This is what this is what it's like if I have the map ready.

169
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,894
Scott: ready Huh?

170
00:10:31,293 --> 00:10:34,010
Scott: It took two seconds, I actually doubt that the map is out.

171
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,950
Scott: It's folded to the spot where you are is already facing out.

172
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,097
Scott: But how do you know where you are?

173
00:10:38,157 --> 00:10:38,499
Scott: take it?

174
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,270
Scott: Cuz you look at the street sign or some shit.

175
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,960
Rym: All right, so you've already had to look at the street sign.

176
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:42,985
Scott: How do you know where you are?

177
00:10:43,026 --> 00:10:43,770
Scott: and in Metro?

178
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,980
Scott: It's like Metroid right you push start to bring the map up.

179
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:48,170
Scott: Oh and you push start again in the maps gone.

180
00:10:48,452 --> 00:10:49,438
Scott: How do I know where?

181
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:50,646
Scott: I know I'm in fucking Norfair?

182
00:10:50,707 --> 00:10:52,494
Rym: All right You gotta find it.

183
00:10:52,514 --> 00:10:52,995
Rym: what if your bike?

184
00:10:53,116 --> 00:10:56,205
Scott: I know the elevator was three screens to the left.

185
00:10:56,366 --> 00:10:57,168
Scott: cuz I've gone.

186
00:10:57,248 --> 00:10:57,830
Scott: three screens.

187
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:58,434
Scott: Yeah, right.

188
00:10:58,475 --> 00:11:00,410
Scott: So you know what the map out of Norfair I go.

189
00:11:00,596 --> 00:11:02,054
Rym: Oh, yeah You already have to pull the map out.

190
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,986
Rym: my phone already shows me exactly where I am and my cargo direction.

191
00:11:05,006 --> 00:11:05,890
Scott: pulling the phone out.

192
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:10,850
Scott: It's just as long as you're kidding pulling my phone You got to unlock the phone and then you got to push the map icon.

193
00:11:11,432 --> 00:11:18,804
Rym: Actually, the maps already open because I put my phone in navigation mode with the Google my places thing Not my places Google on my tracks.

194
00:11:19,187 --> 00:11:22,968
Rym: Uh-huh So whenever I'm going anywhere, my phone is always in like super GPS mode.

195
00:11:23,672 --> 00:11:25,100
Rym: Mmm, you should try that.

196
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,145
Rym: Oh wait, you have an iPhone.

197
00:11:26,165 --> 00:11:27,050
Rym: That's not that stuff works.

198
00:11:27,231 --> 00:11:28,437
Rym: I just see your maps are kind of shitty.

199
00:11:28,618 --> 00:11:30,709
Scott: My map is paper map is the best.

200
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:33,121
Rym: Yeah Because you have an iPhone with shitty Google Maps.

201
00:11:33,141 --> 00:11:38,243
Rym: if you had a Google map that worked all the time Really catching a lot.

202
00:11:38,324 --> 00:11:42,969
Scott: I I'm not saying I'm not gonna have a phone I'm saying the paper map is faster.

203
00:11:43,472 --> 00:11:48,169
Rym: But the thing that I missed the most was literally primarily if the paper map was in fear.

204
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:50,380
Scott: here I use the best technology for any job.

205
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:55,230
Rym: Yes, and I think the best technology for that is Made of paper the Android phone.

206
00:11:56,691 --> 00:11:58,401
Scott: So anyway, and your battery dies.

207
00:11:58,461 --> 00:12:01,095
Scott: and now I look at my paper map My battery is fine.

208
00:12:01,175 --> 00:12:02,140
Rym: actually doing biking.

209
00:12:02,401 --> 00:12:04,110
Rym: a whole day of biking with GPS is fine.

210
00:12:04,855 --> 00:12:05,420
Scott: Anyway, you done.

211
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,799
Rym: Uh, no But it was in I'm thinking about.

212
00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:29,450
Rym: I'm trying to like put down all the like problems I ran into in my life not having this phone and I guess I'd always kind of posited like how heavily I rely on having an always-on always available data plan with GPS and all these things and Not having it for a week Validated that to a ludicrous degree.

213
00:12:30,073 --> 00:12:33,210
Rym: Like maybe I might have thought oh, maybe I can get away just fine with my foot without my phone.

214
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,236
Rym: No, I can't.

215
00:12:34,477 --> 00:12:42,391
Rym: that phone is so pivotal to my life That I would have to change my entire way of doing things if I were not to have a phone for an extended period of Time.

216
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:44,630
Scott: and this is the person when you didn't have a smartphone.

217
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:47,486
Scott: You're even against getting a phone with a camera on it.

218
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:56,250
Scott: and I was like Just like when you were using Internet Explorer and I was like you should really use fire When I was against cameras on phones.

219
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,996
Rym: That was when I worked in a place where if you had a camera on your phone You weren't allowed to bring it in the building.

220
00:13:00,297 --> 00:13:02,727
Scott: Listen many times throughout history.

221
00:13:02,887 --> 00:13:05,436
Scott: I've been the one Example so one.

222
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:08,030
Rym: I wasn't allowed to bring a phone.

223
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,297
Scott: No, you were also in my office.

224
00:13:10,318 --> 00:13:13,067
Scott: You got one while you were working at that place.

225
00:13:13,227 --> 00:13:14,070
Scott: In fact, right?

226
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,363
Scott: So apparently it wasn't too much of an issue and you did not end.

227
00:13:17,644 --> 00:13:19,210
Scott: that was your at the time.

228
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,801
Scott: You said I quote you do.

229
00:13:21,822 --> 00:13:23,690
Scott: that was not your excuse for not needing one.

230
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:26,710
Scott: Your excuse was who needs a camera on a phone?

231
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:30,203
Rym: So Scott stupid my first cell phone didn't have a camera.

232
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:31,850
Rym: because of that they didn't exist.

233
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:33,066
Rym: Yeah, they did.

234
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:38,063
Rym: Yeah, anyway, I got another phone later.

235
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,648
Rym: I worked in a different building.

236
00:13:39,668 --> 00:13:44,769
Rym: at that point I could have a camera but the cat the pictures the camera took were so shitty.

237
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:48,496
Scott: and Yeah, you use that camera Relatively often.

238
00:13:48,616 --> 00:13:48,878
Rym: actually.

239
00:13:48,918 --> 00:13:51,209
Rym: that what I didn't cuz I had no way to get the pictures off of that phone.

240
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:53,036
Scott: I remember you getting the pictures off.

241
00:13:53,377 --> 00:13:55,865
Rym: No, no, you're thinking of my pre.

242
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,170
Scott: No the blue phone.

243
00:13:57,451 --> 00:13:58,596
Rym: I couldn't get pictures off of that.

244
00:13:59,098 --> 00:14:00,263
Scott: I remember you getting pictures.

245
00:14:00,624 --> 00:14:01,910
Rym: I had no way to get pictures off of that.

246
00:14:02,354 --> 00:14:02,859
Rym: I had a fee.

247
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:10,732
Rym: I took pictures of things I Lost.

248
00:14:11,654 --> 00:14:14,221
Rym: my next phone was the palm pre and you know what.

249
00:14:14,602 --> 00:14:18,637
Rym: the camera was high enough megapixel and I could just dump them to My computer.

250
00:14:18,678 --> 00:14:20,350
Rym: that suddenly the camera was awesome.

251
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:28,579
Rym: the only reason the camera wasn't awesome on the older phones is because the phone the pictures on those cameras sucked and it was hard to Get the pictures off on those old ass phones.

252
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:30,768
Scott: Just want to say who needs tab browsing?

253
00:14:30,789 --> 00:14:30,849
Scott: who?

254
00:14:33,612 --> 00:14:35,782
Scott: Who needs a phone with a camera in it?

255
00:14:35,863 --> 00:14:36,686
Scott: who need right?

256
00:14:36,727 --> 00:14:37,349
Scott: this is Rym.

257
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:42,970
Rym: Like smartphones, I wanted a smartphone from day one, but I couldn't afford one.

258
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,742
Scott: Yeah, uncle moneybags vice president couldn't afford to smart.

259
00:14:46,763 --> 00:14:51,484
Rym: Yes, because I was a vice president in like 2006 a lot of people we know who are way poor.

260
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:52,630
Scott: they got plenty of smartphones.

261
00:14:53,213 --> 00:14:55,525
Rym: Okay, you realize data plans were a lot more expensive.

262
00:14:55,626 --> 00:14:59,862
Scott: They're still the same 2004-2005 more expensive now because they're giving you less.

263
00:14:59,962 --> 00:15:01,668
Rym: and also back then a lot of phones.

264
00:15:01,728 --> 00:15:03,557
Rym: the GPS Sucked and was useless.

265
00:15:03,597 --> 00:15:05,285
Rym: the maps sucked and were useless.

266
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:06,230
Rym: things were very different back.

267
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:27,056
Rym: Then it wasn't worth the money for the pity piddly benefit I get because I realized from this experience that the primary things I use my phone for are basically Looking at videos and or kind of high bandwidth data getting emails in a push format using Twitter and High precision GPS stuff.

268
00:15:27,638 --> 00:15:31,070
Rym: Those are literally the primary things that I needed and everything else really didn't matter.

269
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,999
Scott: Anyway, let's move on.

270
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:34,683
Rym: Okay.

271
00:15:34,743 --> 00:15:35,386
Scott: Let it Rym.

272
00:15:35,407 --> 00:15:36,010
Scott: So check this out.

273
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:42,450
Scott: So Google+ a lot of people they'd be down on Google+ all over the Internet's and you know what?

274
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:49,074
Scott: I think you know, it's I'm always the person who's just like whatever, you know, everyone's always like, oh this service is good That one's bad.

275
00:15:49,174 --> 00:15:52,550
Scott: It's like who get or that, you know, one changes the because it's a good change.

276
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,356
Scott: Oh, it's a bad change.

277
00:15:53,417 --> 00:15:55,050
Scott: Mostly people say it's a bad only problem with you.

278
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,355
Scott: It is bad change.

279
00:15:56,395 --> 00:15:58,162
Rym: hardly anyone uses it and there's no API.

280
00:15:58,183 --> 00:16:00,030
Rym: So I never actually look at anything.

281
00:16:01,031 --> 00:16:02,738
Rym: But I never look at anything.

282
00:16:02,758 --> 00:16:05,269
Rym: anyone posts, but I post stuff anyway.

283
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:12,310
Scott: So, you know people are always, you know up and down on these different services switching between them choosing different ones.

284
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,964
Scott: I'm just like, yeah, whatever others use fucking everything.

285
00:16:14,005 --> 00:16:20,050
Scott: I don't care But Google+ is doing something that is potentially the awesomest.

286
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:34,729
Scott: So they have to hangouts right and hangouts have already sort of replaced Skype ish for the group conference situation with video Because it lets you do extra stuff like share, you know, watch YouTube videos together and stuff like that.

287
00:16:35,814 --> 00:16:39,770
Scott: They have an API for Google Hangouts and you might think oh, what is this API do?

288
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:44,254
Scott: it lets you make apps for Google Hangout, which is genius.

289
00:16:44,294 --> 00:17:05,819
Scott: amazing because now you can basically Start a hangout and you can write an app and then basically your app will occupy all that space that the faces aren't Occupying on the screen and everyone can sort of interact in that space with whatever your app does which happens to be perfect for Every board game in the goddamn known universe

290
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,624
Rym: never mind every role-playing game

291
00:17:08,105 --> 00:17:08,406
Scott: right.

292
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:14,053
Scott: in addition You know, it's also The.

293
00:17:14,093 --> 00:17:18,510
Scott: the reason people found out about this thing is because someone's making Dominion for they showed it off at Google.

294
00:17:18,611 --> 00:17:20,130
Scott: It looks like fucking Dominion.

295
00:17:20,811 --> 00:17:25,909
Scott: but really the real magic here that people don't realize is that a very hard thing to do.

296
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:37,355
Scott: a Relatively difficult thing to do is to write a web application that has real-time synchronized Updated shared data between the different people right?

297
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:42,248
Scott: So, you know you think about you know, pretty much any real-time multiplayer thing.

298
00:17:42,993 --> 00:17:55,050
Scott: There has to be some sort of shared data data that everyone has in common that Different people can modify and all of those data modifications by the different participants is updated to all the other participants, right?

299
00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:01,406
Scott: The Google Hangout API pretty much makes that just work like brain-dead easy.

300
00:18:01,566 --> 00:18:06,804
Scott: You pretty much say hey Update the state and then on the other people there's an event that's like on the state.

301
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:12,450
Scott: when the state is changed do this Then change the state and when the state is and the other people have when this data change do that.

302
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:14,750
Scott: It's just straightforward and really simple.

303
00:18:15,232 --> 00:18:18,885
Scott: You don't have to code any of this hard stuff because the Google servers just take care of it.

304
00:18:19,086 --> 00:18:21,055
Rym: So Scott, here's the thing Should.

305
00:18:21,819 --> 00:18:23,750
Rym: are we going to do anything with this or we should talking?

306
00:18:25,411 --> 00:18:27,438
Scott: You know, we could make YouTube the game on it.

307
00:18:27,598 --> 00:18:30,347
Rym: We probably should make YouTube the game probably but will we?

308
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:33,443
Rym: that's what I'm asking Since we're on air now, you know, are we going to?

309
00:18:33,463 --> 00:18:34,449
Rym: you know, we're kings of shit.

310
00:18:34,469 --> 00:18:34,630
Scott: talk.

311
00:18:36,312 --> 00:18:41,030
Rym: You want to move up to Emperor Emperor shit the Emperor of shit and talk dude, at least I'll be an emperor.

312
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,826
Scott: Emperor God Emperor.

313
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,601
Scott: The only thing above Emperor.

314
00:18:47,681 --> 00:18:49,690
Scott: all they have left is modifications of Emperor.

315
00:18:50,092 --> 00:18:52,910
Scott: You can't really get better than them, you know if we're gonna use that title?

316
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:57,854
Rym: I actually prefer Imperator because it sounds so much more In the Imperator.

317
00:18:57,894 --> 00:19:00,525
Scott: someone below the Emperor sort of like a chance.

318
00:19:00,545 --> 00:19:01,770
Scott: allure is below the chance.

319
00:19:02,452 --> 00:19:04,078
Rym: I think they just come from the same route.

320
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,028
Scott: I thought it was like you're the Emperor and the Imperator.

321
00:19:07,088 --> 00:19:07,429
Rym: Here we go.

322
00:19:07,752 --> 00:19:13,150
Rym: Latin word Imperator was originally a title roughly equivalent to commander under the Roman Republic.

323
00:19:13,692 --> 00:19:18,266
Rym: It later became part of the titulature of the Roman emperors as part of their cognomen.

324
00:19:18,968 --> 00:19:19,550
Scott: What's cognomen?

325
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:21,700
Rym: All right Let me click on that.

326
00:19:21,741 --> 00:19:33,930
Rym: like you don't know Cognomen Latin plural cognomenia together with was the third name of a citizen of ancient Rome Under Roman naming conventions, so I would be Scott Rubin cognomen.

327
00:19:34,932 --> 00:19:39,994
Rym: No, you would have a cognomen and the cognitive your nickname like Scott Rubin Dicker.

328
00:19:40,014 --> 00:19:46,344
Scott: Oh I get it nom name nom and hog nom.

329
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:51,544
Scott: I know what the cog is for but Nomine is clearly name related.

330
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:54,633
Scott: All right, anyway We'll see.

331
00:19:54,754 --> 00:19:57,630
Rym: Let's see if we move up to Emperor because I got some ideas and you have some ideas.

332
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:03,950
Scott: Yeah, but you know back when in the day I remember the Facebook apps first appeared and I was like what kind of app would you make on Facebook?

333
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:04,774
Scott: And I really right.

334
00:20:04,794 --> 00:20:14,010
Scott: but if you had made a quick move on that you would have been Swinging right if you had made like early Facebook apps, so here's your chance to make early Google+ hangout apps.

335
00:20:14,891 --> 00:20:17,042
Scott: Which could you know make Google+?

336
00:20:17,122 --> 00:20:18,650
Scott: it's a chicken and egg situation, right?

337
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,821
Scott: And it's like, you know, will this succeed or fail?

338
00:20:20,861 --> 00:20:24,909
Scott: who knows but making apps for it Is the chicken to the egg to make it succeed?

339
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,680
Scott: If you could make an app and it could still fail.

340
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,408
Scott: but making more apps for it helps.

341
00:20:29,469 --> 00:20:31,356
Scott: it Decreases the chance of the failing.

342
00:20:31,757 --> 00:20:33,303
Scott: so that goes both ways.

343
00:20:33,604 --> 00:20:35,269
Rym: Well, we'll see if we do anything with it.

344
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,414
Scott: Yep, I can at least try out hello world.

345
00:20:43,446 --> 00:20:45,770
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

346
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:51,555
Rym: I hope none of you have seen this but if you watch every TED talk Then you've probably run into it at some point.

347
00:20:52,176 --> 00:21:07,426
Rym: This is Marco tempest doing an amazing little sort of performance art biography of Nikola Tesla, okay, it is Pretty amazing to watch just for the way it's presented and I don't want to say anything else.

348
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:08,490
Rym: It's only six minutes long.

349
00:21:08,874 --> 00:21:09,581
Rym: Just watch it.

350
00:21:09,723 --> 00:21:10,309
Rym: It's great.

351
00:21:10,832 --> 00:21:12,029
Scott: I'll take the time of grove over.

352
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:14,788
Rym: So what do you got?

353
00:21:15,793 --> 00:21:17,450
Scott: So everyone probably saw this already.

354
00:21:18,132 --> 00:21:22,647
Scott: It's a Japanese robot because they seem to make the best robots and it plays rock-paper-scissors.

355
00:21:22,687 --> 00:21:26,197
Scott: It's a robot fist But it has a 100% win rate.

356
00:21:26,378 --> 00:21:26,839
Scott: Now.

357
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:29,386
Scott: You're probably thinking whoa, how can you have a 100% win rate?

358
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,334
Scott: With rock-paper-scissors.

359
00:21:32,695 --> 00:21:36,147
Scott: I mean if I can't write a rock-paper-scissors bot that always win.

360
00:21:36,187 --> 00:21:46,610
Rym: now what I would assume I would think maybe it's using like Resonance imaging or like facial stuff to like read the person's mind, which we'll probably have someday.

361
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,670
Rym: But this thing works in such a simpler principle?

362
00:21:50,011 --> 00:22:04,345
Scott: yeah, so what this does actually is as a camera that watches your fist to see what you through and Then the robot is just so fast that it will always Counter-attack and win after it.

363
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:05,210
Scott: so basically it's cheating.

364
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:08,566
Scott: It's like if I look and I see what Rym does and then he throws scissor.

365
00:22:08,586 --> 00:22:10,577
Scott: I put out a rock He throws out a paper.

366
00:22:10,638 --> 00:22:16,766
Scott: I throw out a scissor only it's so fast You can't realize that I'm cheating cuz I'm like, you know Superman now.

367
00:22:16,786 --> 00:22:17,770
Scott: That's what this robot does.

368
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:22,629
Rym: it's questionable as to whether or not it actually is cheating because it's non-detectable.

369
00:22:22,649 --> 00:22:24,159
Rym: and No, what?

370
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:24,910
Rym: most people who play?

371
00:22:26,696 --> 00:22:28,050
Rym: Most people who play paper-rock-scissors?

372
00:22:28,592 --> 00:22:29,877
Rym: Don't think about it.

373
00:22:29,957 --> 00:22:33,490
Rym: in terms of is there a race condition like what is the allowable?

374
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:37,621
Rym: Interval between the two hands opening before it's considered a foul?

375
00:22:37,701 --> 00:22:43,281
Rym: and you try again because it is Impossible to be perfectly synchronized.

376
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:45,910
Rym: You have to allow for some manner of deviation.

377
00:22:46,111 --> 00:22:47,455
Scott: yes, but it's any it?

378
00:22:47,755 --> 00:22:57,633
Scott: I think what it is is if two humans are playing if the if the you know if the differ if The time difference is detectable by humans then it's too long Right.

379
00:22:57,713 --> 00:23:01,370
Rym: So you're saying if a human and a robot play then if the time difference is detectable by a robot.

380
00:23:02,292 --> 00:23:06,773
Scott: let's discuss the more fundamental question, right is Undetected?

381
00:23:07,055 --> 00:23:07,720
Scott: is it cheating?

382
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,234
Scott: Okay, if you are not caught Well, it depends.

383
00:23:11,274 --> 00:23:15,270
Rym: You know what cheating is only defined as violating the explicit rules of the game, right?

384
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,409
Rym: So let's say so what are the rules?

385
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,077
Scott: So let's say I play baseball.

386
00:23:19,258 --> 00:23:21,350
Scott: Yeah, and I take steroids which is against the rules.

387
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,099
Rym: Yep, so you're cheating and I'm never.

388
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,797
Scott: and I but I do I'm so good at it They I'm never ever caught or even suspected.

389
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:29,301
Rym: I would argue that you still cheated.

390
00:23:29,763 --> 00:23:31,949
Scott: Okay, so therefore the robot you'd.

391
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:32,350
Rym: ah.

392
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:36,741
Rym: But what is the definition of cheating in tic-tac-toe or paper-rock-scissors?

393
00:23:36,802 --> 00:23:39,749
Rym: I don't know why you can't cheat a tic-tac-toe.

394
00:23:40,494 --> 00:23:42,470
Rym: Maybe I can't I erase your oh and put it.

395
00:23:46,136 --> 00:23:47,706
Scott: I think there's a situation though, right?

396
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:53,821
Rym: Where Scott if you and I play paper-rock-scissors if you're a Fraction behind me.

397
00:23:53,902 --> 00:23:54,749
Rym: What's the line?

398
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,577
Scott: If you could detect that I'm a fraction.

399
00:23:57,637 --> 00:24:02,496
Rym: so if I detect I'll just every time I lose I'll say up you were too late You couldn't actually detect it.

400
00:24:02,556 --> 00:24:03,762
Rym: I would just say I detected it.

401
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:05,610
Scott: You just say you detected.

402
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:11,617
Rym: How do you lose until you win and I'd foul everything until I won Four thousand.

403
00:24:11,637 --> 00:24:16,781
Rym: you're out like baseball Calls the foul the person who's late of the person who's early.

404
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:18,226
Scott: if you're late you're fouled.

405
00:24:18,246 --> 00:24:19,190
Scott: early is always better.

406
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,955
Rym: So I declare that I saw you being late every time We had.

407
00:24:23,217 --> 00:24:25,874
Scott: if you're gonna be a jerk then we need Judge.

408
00:24:26,075 --> 00:24:27,910
Scott: this is if you're gonna be a jerk on a video reap.

409
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:32,124
Rym: What I'm saying is that this is why soccer needs goddamn video replay.

410
00:24:32,144 --> 00:24:32,646
Rym: That's right.

411
00:24:32,706 --> 00:24:33,569
Rym: Fuck the World Cup.

412
00:24:33,589 --> 00:24:33,850
Rym: That's right.

413
00:24:35,031 --> 00:24:36,174
Scott: All the cups that don't I.

414
00:24:36,215 --> 00:24:37,920
Rym: just I can't care about soccer anymore.

415
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:41,150
Rym: all that all the FIFA's because of the officiating situation.

416
00:24:41,454 --> 00:24:42,022
Rym: Pretend everything.

417
00:24:42,043 --> 00:24:45,898
Rym: I just said fuck Something anus.

418
00:24:46,323 --> 00:24:50,303
Scott: I don't know I was trying to turn FIFA because it had I in it to be.

419
00:24:50,403 --> 00:24:52,210
Scott: to use the word instant use fucking an anus?

420
00:24:52,773 --> 00:24:53,780
Scott: Well, no to be.

421
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,430
Scott: I was trying to make an acronym out of it.

422
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:58,985
Scott: That would be get some fucking instant replay assholes because it had F an instant.

423
00:24:59,005 --> 00:25:06,187
Scott: So F. Yes I don't know what to do with the F and the The other F in the a few men do.

424
00:25:11,672 --> 00:25:13,620
Rym: The book club book is what you're going to do.

425
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:20,351
Rym: show on as soon as we get a chance because we're both done with the Book, but we had to bail out a show cutie in 84

426
00:25:20,351 --> 00:25:32,453
Scott: Other meta moments not this weekend, but next weekend, which happens to be July 13 14 15 2012 is Connecticut 2012

427
00:25:32,453 --> 00:25:34,141
Rym: in hard to for to connect a kid.

428
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:35,427
Scott: You should fucking go.

429
00:25:35,487 --> 00:25:37,197
Rym: if you're close We run the panels.

430
00:25:37,217 --> 00:25:39,090
Scott: don't come too far to go there.

431
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,957
Scott: But if you're close better be there.

432
00:25:40,977 --> 00:25:55,149
Rym: and I will tell you this we have scheduled more panels Workshops and events in the 11 panel of workshop rooms we have than any Connecticut has ever had which means if you show up you're gonna see even less percentage of the stuff there is to see.

433
00:25:55,932 --> 00:25:59,946
Rym: But at the same time it's a amount of time you there is no way I'm gonna.

434
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:01,695
Rym: I'm gonna take Saturday All right.

436
00:26:09,847 --> 00:26:15,349
Rym: Michelle Lang's She's a guest of the con to Jeopardy stuck, which is a homestuck panel.

437
00:26:15,651 --> 00:26:16,634
Scott: Why did we allow that?

438
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:21,590
Rym: because home sucks popular and of the 11 that were submitted I picked the two that looked best.

439
00:26:22,091 --> 00:26:22,834
Scott: Jeopardy stuck.

440
00:26:22,894 --> 00:26:24,298
Rym: the D&D we never knew.

441
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:28,493
Rym: the 36 chamber an intro to kung fu cinema I'm going there.

442

Rym: the atomic Robo 8-bit theater meet-and-greet with Brian Clevenger.

443
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:36,662
Rym: I've been to that twice of anime opening style and symbolism.

444
00:26:36,682 --> 00:26:37,163
Rym: Oh my god.

445
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:45,449
Rym: Star Trek and feminism and maintaining motivation in writing and the cutting truth of medieval swords a lesson in sword fighting.

446
00:26:45,489 --> 00:26:47,273
Rym: those are Simultaneously.

447
00:26:47,293 --> 00:26:48,758
Rym: those are all simultaneously around.

448
00:26:48,838 --> 00:26:50,043
Scott: I want to go like three of them.

449
00:26:50,384 --> 00:26:52,211
Rym: Yeah, this is a pretty fucking awesome Kind.

450
00:26:52,231 --> 00:26:54,377
Scott: so anyway also and John St.

00:26:54,418 --> 00:26:55,320
Rym: John's gonna be there again.

452

Scott: You can go to this con and just play board games.

453
00:26:58,551 --> 00:27:02,995
Scott: I've said this before best board games there are at any convention I've been to ever.

454
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,844
Rym: that includes any acts and mags.

455

Scott: There's plenty of tables.

456
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:09,801
Scott: This is the best game library ever and it by playing just by playing games.

457
00:27:09,882 --> 00:27:11,667
Scott: even if you lose you get tickets.

458
00:27:11,928 --> 00:27:17,210
Scott: a very small Amount of tickets will get you free games that are worth a lot of money and real dollars.

459
00:27:17,351 --> 00:27:19,889
Scott: You can pay for your own badge just like playing a lot of board games.

460
00:27:21,331 --> 00:27:24,376
Scott: Connecticut okay Pax prime is Labor Day.

461
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:25,440
Scott: You know the score.

462
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,246
Rym: probably be there Pax devs.

463
00:27:27,266 --> 00:27:30,262
Rym: before that there's a chance I will be there maybe with Scott.

464
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:35,387
Rym: Yeah, if Scott's not there It's just because he doesn't want to spend vacation days because I don't have them all right.

465
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:39,070
Scott: in addition Other news we've been keeping updating the website.

466
00:27:39,432 --> 00:27:42,830
Scott: You know the website that not too many people go to and we keep spreading.

467
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,141
Scott: You know our philosophy is hey, we don't.

468
00:27:45,302 --> 00:27:50,290
Scott: if you don't like coming to our website fine We're gonna post our shit on Google Facebook Twitter fucking everywhere.

469
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:54,842
Scott: We added something new an old-fashioned email newsletter.

470
00:27:54,903 --> 00:28:02,867
Scott: if you are old and busted Luddite We are emailing out an update about once every other week or so.

471
00:28:03,047 --> 00:28:03,689
Scott: ish, right?

472
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:10,546
Scott: Reminding you of what GeekNights has done in the past couple weeks with some other content in there as well.

473
00:28:10,646 --> 00:28:11,910
Scott: email reminder of what?

474
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:12,552
Scott: we're up to.

475
00:28:13,014 --> 00:28:18,317
Scott: if you like email reminders you can go to front recruitment calm and Subscribe to the email newsletter.

476
00:28:18,598 --> 00:28:20,970
Scott: all the only information you have to type in is your email address.

477
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,877
Scott: unsubscribing actually works.

478
00:28:22,957 --> 00:28:24,223
Scott: mail chimp just takes care of it.

479
00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:27,342
Scott: and It's so far.

480
00:28:27,402 --> 00:28:27,947
Scott: I wrote one email.

481
00:28:28,853 --> 00:28:30,078
Scott: People didn't seem to complain.

482
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,384
Scott: so there you go.

483
00:28:31,745 --> 00:28:33,593
Scott: if you like email newsletters I know.

484
00:28:33,693 --> 00:28:42,086
Rym: if you don't like email newsletters, then don't sign up all right, so uh UEFI has been in the news a lot, but only nerds care about it.

485
00:28:42,608 --> 00:28:47,887
Rym: and Cisco's cloud connect has been in the news a lot and only nerds care about it.

486
00:28:47,907 --> 00:28:52,743
Rym: mm-hmm This these both reek of a really fundamental problem.

487
00:28:52,843 --> 00:28:53,786
Scott: It's somebody's cloud care.

488
00:28:53,806 --> 00:28:58,302
Scott: cuz I looked up the cloud connect It was actually called on the website that I found the official Cisco website.

489
00:28:58,322 --> 00:29:03,060
Rym: It was called connect cloud, but on the website There's another site that said Cisco cloud vision.

490
00:29:03,361 --> 00:29:18,200
Scott: uh-huh so what I read was that it's pretty much You know we have this problem where you have your home network But your ISP gives you dynamic IPS and they suck and you have a router that gnats you so it's very hard to provide Services from your home internet service.

491
00:29:18,241 --> 00:29:19,445
Scott: can you know internet connection?

492
00:29:19,846 --> 00:29:20,890
Scott: so with this cloud connect?

493
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:24,019
Scott: Theoretically does or connect cloud is on your router.

494
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:24,821
Scott: your router links.

495
00:29:24,841 --> 00:29:26,345
Scott: this router supports connect cloud.

496
00:29:26,706 --> 00:29:27,949
Scott: you can get apps for it.

497
00:29:28,411 --> 00:29:38,030
Scott: So for example you could enable the file transferring app and then no matter where you were in the world You'd be able to connect to the computers in your house as if it was the cloud.

498
00:29:38,351 --> 00:29:46,287
Scott: You know a cloud service and upload and send files back and forth to your house from anywhere as if you were Hosting cloud things at your house.

499
00:29:47,012 --> 00:29:53,970
Scott: There are already a lot of equipments that a lot of NAS is do this where they'll use UPnP and a dynamic DNS service to achieve the same effect.

500
00:29:55,112 --> 00:29:59,050
Scott: So that's what the cloud connect thing does according to the website.

501
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:02,299
Rym: So I'm gonna read a statement from one of many articles about this.

502
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:07,419
Rym: alright last week a number of Cisco customers bit began reporting problems with three specific links.

503
00:30:07,479 --> 00:30:10,270
Rym: is routers the E2700 e3500 e4500.

504
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:21,573
Rym: okay one day they attempted to log in and They were told to log in and register using their Cisco connect cloud account information, which they did not have accounts They was.

505
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:28,010
Rym: there was no way to get into their own physical router without registering with Cisco cloud connect.

506
00:30:28,371 --> 00:30:35,189
Rym: Cisco had silently upgraded their firmware removed any option of downgrading and forced them to set this up.

507
00:30:36,951 --> 00:30:39,090
Rym: Cisco now controlled their router.

508
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:40,688
Rym: So it gets worse.

509
00:30:41,572 --> 00:30:42,656
Rym: It gets way worse.

510
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:47,170
Scott: cuz they want you to cry cuz the way it works is you have to log in to the Cisco server.

511
00:30:47,271 --> 00:30:52,962
Scott: So once you run on the cloud And then that connects you to your router manage your router.

512
00:30:53,263 --> 00:31:00,180
Rym: you can no longer manage your own router anymore And there's no way to turn it off once it happens.

513
00:31:00,261 --> 00:31:02,430
Rym: There's no way to do anything with your router.

514
00:31:02,992 --> 00:31:04,378
Rym: Suddenly they have power over you.

515
00:31:04,419 --> 00:31:05,423
Rym: so it gets way worse.

516
00:31:05,845 --> 00:31:13,330
Rym: I'm going to read a few sentences from the actual Terms of service of this thing which you are now forced to use if you want.

517
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:16,423
Scott: Did you search other routers terms of service to see if they say similar?

518
00:31:16,463 --> 00:31:18,190
Rym: No this isn't router terms of service.

519
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:21,466
Rym: This is Cisco cloud connect terms of service or your router.

520
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:27,710
Rym: if you're using it All right as the condition of your use of the service you agree that your sister blah blah blah will comply with all applicable laws.

521
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:28,213
Rym: blah blah blah.

522
00:31:28,494 --> 00:31:38,185
Rym: you agree to not use or permit the use of the service to invade another's privacy to for obscene pornographic or offensive purposes.

523
00:31:38,728 --> 00:31:53,564
Rym: so you Another's rights including but not limited to intellectual property rights to email upload or otherwise transmitter make available unauthorized Advertising promotional materials spam junk mail or any form of solicitation.

524
00:31:53,785 --> 00:31:55,230
Scott: because you know how this thing probably works.

525
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:59,710
Scott: It's probably not doing just dynamic DNS with a you know an IP hole on your router.

526
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:04,930
Scott: What it's probably doing is you're sending stuff to Cisco's cloud servers, and then they're sending it to your router.

527
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:09,090
Scott: That's probably how it works, and they don't want you to put that shit on their servers.

528
00:32:09,955 --> 00:32:13,640
Rym: so Yeah, yeah, so basically without now.

529
00:32:13,761 --> 00:32:34,749
Rym: It looks like after the crazy nerd outcry They backpedaled and they provided instructions on how to like physically reset And then download the old firmware and get your router back, but that's not the end of this and we're gonna see what happens because once Cisco controls my router and not me fuck you Cisco.

530
00:32:35,172 --> 00:32:38,128
Scott: Well, I mean I don't know anybody's buying a Cisco router.

531
00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:38,410
Scott: everyone.

532
00:32:38,491 --> 00:32:40,110
Rym: Yeah, you mean you mean a linksys router.

533
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:50,170
Scott: I mean everyone knows that the good linksys router is the oldest best one Yes, you are t54g and that every other linksys router except for that one is shit alright.

534
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,642
Rym: So if I need to buy a new router today, which one do I buy?

535
00:32:52,662 --> 00:32:54,170
Rym: the one I have all right?

536
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,089
Rym: Which one is that the netgear?

537
00:32:57,171 --> 00:32:59,583
Scott: WNDR 3700. there's actually slightly newer better ones.

538
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:03,830
Rym: so we cool with the world where Cisco if you buy a Cisco router you don't know better.

539
00:33:04,294 --> 00:33:06,129
Rym: You know you just plug it in and it just starts working.

540
00:33:06,612 --> 00:33:10,209
Rym: But Cisco actually now controls it and can do stuff to you.

541
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:23,076
Scott: This is why we say every person who uses computers no matter how you know No, you know little technological stuff You think you're involved in you need to fucking learn computers.

542
00:33:23,116 --> 00:33:33,838
Scott: no matter if you're a plumber or a schoolteacher or a student Everyone in the world needs to know computers so that you don't get fucked anyone who doesn't learn computers.

543
00:33:33,898 --> 00:33:37,640
Scott: in the modern world You will be fucked by companies pulling the shit out.

544
00:33:37,781 --> 00:33:40,071
Rym: So here's another part of the privacy statement.

545
00:33:40,332 --> 00:33:43,203
Rym: if you're using a router that has this When you use the service.

546
00:33:43,384 --> 00:33:49,300
Scott: Cisco can look at all your internets yeah, and they send it to Cisco among they specifically track your internet history.

547
00:33:49,501 --> 00:33:52,160
Rym: Yep, there you go and all network traffic.

548
00:33:52,541 --> 00:34:07,968
Scott: The thing is a nerd who was using one of these right could be smart enough to VPN And it wouldn't even matter to you right because if I'd use my little eye Predator VPN for my laptop, and I happen to can say a coffee shop is using this you know crappy Cisco router I'll be totally safe.

549
00:34:08,068 --> 00:34:10,120
Rym: Yeah, but this would be like buying a router.

550
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:13,033
Rym: That's a black box that someone else controls and just trusting it.

551
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,359
Scott: well you see what they want to do in the UK.

552
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:34,958
Scott: Yeah, trying to push a thing where the force is PS to install black boxes and those black boxes basically Will man in the middle all the SSL gmails and things like of that nature so that the UK government can spy on pretty much everyone using a UK is be And that's why I will not live there.

553
00:34:35,844 --> 00:34:43,994
Rym: So that if I did if I visited there I would VPN all the time, but much more dangerous to the health of computers everywhere.

554
00:34:44,034 --> 00:34:48,628
Rym: this this harkens back to like CBD TPA kind of stuff right.

555
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:57,900
Scott: so this is thing and it's been coming for a while But now it's really on the verge of coming out for real, and it's starting to you know the talk about it is greatly increased.

556
00:34:57,961 --> 00:35:04,319
Scott: It's called EFI right well It's really the name for is secure boot, which is a facet of oh you EFI.

557
00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:10,340
Scott: well Yeah, so if I support secure boot basically yeah, so secure boot is a feature of an people don't know.

558
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,533
Scott: Let's go back to the beginning right.

559
00:35:11,573 --> 00:35:20,850
Scott: so PCs have BIOS right and max use basically the newer better replacement for BIOS Which is EFI which is this Intel thing right?

560
00:35:20,931 --> 00:35:26,253
Scott: It's it's basically something firmware or something I was gonna ask because I don't think it's enhanced firmware interface.

561
00:35:26,313 --> 00:35:28,060
Scott: Maybe something like that anyway.

562
00:35:28,822 --> 00:35:30,186
Scott: So it's basically a better BIOS.

563
00:35:30,246 --> 00:35:30,347
Scott: is?

564
00:35:30,487 --> 00:35:37,531
Scott: that's why you can't just easily installed like Windows directly out of Mac without like boot camp Weirdness because Windows is built for BIOS.

565
00:35:37,612 --> 00:35:38,596
Scott: It's not built for EFI.

566
00:35:39,138 --> 00:35:50,400
Scott: so For Windows 8 right they're gonna finally move to EFI which is better than BIOS But has all these features such as restrictions and whatnot which is why you can't just install Windows on a Mac hardware.

567
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,931
Scott: so anyway That's an EFI is no problem really right.

568
00:35:54,991 --> 00:35:55,915
Scott: everyone can deal with that.

569
00:35:55,935 --> 00:36:03,631
Scott: the problem is that the Windows 8 they are making a contractual agreement right.

570
00:36:03,651 --> 00:36:05,215
Scott: this is Microsoft is forcing this.

571
00:36:05,316 --> 00:36:13,220
Scott: Microsoft is saying look if You want right on your computers that you're selling to put a sticker that says Windows 8 compatible

572
00:36:14,065 --> 00:36:14,286
Rym: You

573
00:36:14,407 --> 00:36:16,660
Scott: must not only use UAF I

574
00:36:17,362 --> 00:36:17,643
Rym: you

575
00:36:17,744 --> 00:36:36,799
Scott: have to and have it secure boot, which is a feature of UFI installed and Loaded and configured on that hardware, so if a motherboard wants to say we're compatible with Windows 8 in their marketing Microsoft will not let them do that and will sue them if they say it unless they have UFI and secure boot, so what is secure boot?

576
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,300
Scott: Secure boot is also known by some people as restricted boot.

577
00:36:41,943 --> 00:36:45,618
Scott: What this does is let's say you got it's sort of what the TiVo does.

578
00:36:45,698 --> 00:36:49,020
Scott: it's in fact It's exactly what the TiVo did only standardized.

579
00:36:49,743 --> 00:36:56,747
Scott: So what TiVo did is they people were buying TiVos and trying to replace the operating system on there But they couldn't because the TiVo would refuse to boot.

580
00:36:57,088 --> 00:37:01,403
Scott: unless you had the exact TiVo software and any other TiVo software It wouldn't boot.

581
00:37:01,927 --> 00:37:03,718
Scott: so secure boot is like that same thing.

582
00:37:03,738 --> 00:37:03,778
Scott: it.

583
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:08,654
Scott: You have some software your operating system, and there is some key some security key.

584
00:37:08,714 --> 00:37:16,662
Scott: the operating system has alright and that there's a hash of the operating system matches a certain number so you can't fake it and They can.

585
00:37:16,682 --> 00:37:22,305
Scott: when the computer turns on it looks at the operating system, and it says is that the operating system I'm supposed to boot?

586
00:37:22,345 --> 00:37:23,935
Scott: now the hardware is doing this right.

587
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:25,503
Scott: this isn't some software You can change.

588
00:37:25,805 --> 00:37:32,299
Scott: the hardware knows about a particular program And it will refuse to start any other program when the computer boots.

589
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:39,428
Rym: now This is a lot like SSL in terms of certificates work in that you have to trust someone to sign stuff Or this is all pointless.

590
00:37:39,468 --> 00:37:41,178
Rym: so basically all right.

591
00:37:41,299 --> 00:37:47,798
Rym: well We'll trust Microsoft to sign stuff and the only thing they're gonna sign is their own software And you can pay them a hundred bucks, and they'll do it.

592
00:37:48,201 --> 00:37:51,216
Rym: Yeah, so every everyone who wants to make malware should pay them a hundred bucks.

593
00:37:51,257 --> 00:37:51,397
Scott: right?

594
00:37:51,437 --> 00:38:01,619
Scott: so let's say I buy a motherboard with secure boot and a new Intel chip And I load it up big time and then I write an assembly program that does some cool graphical demo And I want to run that assembly program.

595
00:38:02,142 --> 00:38:06,440
Scott: I want to put it in the master bootloader and just boot it directly on the chips that I have bought.

596
00:38:07,461 --> 00:38:11,739
Scott: Well my that software is not signed by anyone.

597
00:38:12,241 --> 00:38:16,760
Rym: What if I want to install a Linux distro that didn't go through the hoops and get a signature right?

598
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,180
Scott: I make my roll my own Linux distro with my own kernel and my own bootloader.

599
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:26,359
Rym: And there's also a problem that you can't have multiple signatures for a piece of software right.

600
00:38:26,499 --> 00:38:28,324
Scott: and Now this is fine.

601
00:38:28,344 --> 00:38:34,280
Scott: the hardware is gonna look at my custom Linux, or it's gonna look at my you know cool assembly program.

602
00:38:34,401 --> 00:38:39,724
Scott: I wrote that runs directly on the hardware, and it's gonna say that's not one of the programs I'm supposed to be running.

603
00:38:39,744 --> 00:38:45,800
Rym: I ain't gonna boot now once you can't load arbitrary software on your computer It's not your computer anymore No kidding.

604
00:38:46,061 --> 00:38:57,018
Rym: But Microsoft backed off a little bit in that you can self sign and turn off the like mandatory higher up signature stuff for Windows on Intel

605
00:38:57,622 --> 00:38:57,823
Scott: Mm-hmm

606
00:38:58,506 --> 00:39:12,640
Rym: like x86 architecture, so on ARM They're mandating that any hardware that Windows will be certified for that has that sticker Cannot allow anything that is not signed by them to run on it under any circumstance

607
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,143
Scott: Or they won't.

608
00:39:13,183 --> 00:39:16,742
Scott: well if you can make such hardware and sell it if you want to know But they

609
00:39:16,782 --> 00:39:18,509
Rym: won't let you have it to be certified

610
00:39:18,529 --> 00:39:25,639
Scott: exactly you won't be able to have that sticker that says Windows 8 Compatible or whatever and you can't and they definitely can't sell it with Windows already installed on it

611
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:25,800
Rym: now.

612
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:36,903
Rym: that's a big deal because the What if you add a barrier to entry to install non Microsoft OS is the vast majority of people are incapable of getting around those Barriers exactly.

613
00:39:36,923 --> 00:39:37,666
Scott: I mean already.

614
00:39:37,806 --> 00:39:53,038
Scott: people have trouble when they want to install Linux like telling their computer to boot from USB or CD ROM Instead of you know from the hard drive That's already in there Which is what you need to do if you want to actually reinstall Linux for reals which is why people had things like wubby Which is kind of crap, but it kind of works.

615
00:39:54,201 --> 00:40:01,740
Scott: so to make people do even harder work of like signing something with a security key and Doing the equivalent of that messing around in the BIOS or the setup screen.

616
00:40:02,422 --> 00:40:11,778
Scott: It's gonna be even harder to get people to install Linux instead of Windows or something like that right now or Absolutely impossible because their hardware will not allow it now.

617
00:40:11,798 --> 00:40:26,887
Scott: in Theory the secure boot feature having it on your computer is not so bad because what you can do for example is You can install Linux distribution or Windows and you could then enable it and say all right look you know Secure boot see what's installed right now.

618
00:40:27,027 --> 00:40:31,640
Scott: Yeah, I see that don't run anything else, but that okay, and this would be the good.

619
00:40:31,881 --> 00:40:34,311
Scott: You know implementation be theoretical good implementation.

620
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:35,416
Rym: Yeah, what are the first name?

621
00:40:35,436 --> 00:40:36,440
Rym: install right?

622
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:45,626
Scott: So then if say some virus or evil hacker or something came around and modified your operating system your computer would say hey I'm not booting in fact.

623
00:40:45,666 --> 00:40:51,812
Scott: I'm not even running anymore, and you would bet very well you would know immediately Oh someone hacked and screwed with my operating system.

624
00:40:52,154 --> 00:40:55,147
Scott: I better reflash that shit Reinstall that part.

625
00:40:55,207 --> 00:41:01,211
Scott: you know the boot loading part so that it's clean again And you would just do that and you would be all set and that would be secure boot.

626
00:41:01,452 --> 00:41:05,986
Scott: the problem is the the restricted Secure boot the evil implementation.

627
00:41:06,006 --> 00:41:13,278
Scott: the user is unable to tell the the motherboard or the CPU That no you should trust this.

628
00:41:13,761 --> 00:41:20,420
Scott: It's the people telling the computer what to trust our companies who make ironing systems and not the person who owns that computer.

629
00:41:20,922 --> 00:41:25,337
Scott: I should be able to tell my computer trust this Linux trust that Linux trust this.

630
00:41:25,577 --> 00:41:26,300
Scott: I want to run DOS.

631
00:41:26,761 --> 00:41:27,685
Scott: What's it called free DOS.

632
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:28,548
Scott: trust this free DOS?

633
00:41:28,588 --> 00:41:30,274
Scott: It's cool, but you can't do that.

634
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:43,540
Rym: the way they're doing things now It's you know like Ubuntu and Red Hat are both like working and getting around this and they're doing deals with Microsoft to make It easy for now, but the pragmatic solution right now is not the thing that bothers me.

635
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:52,691
Rym: What bothers me is that we as technologists cannot tolerate going down this road at all because I'm not making the slippery slope argument This is not a slippery slope.

636
00:41:52,772 --> 00:41:54,440
Scott: This is the horrible thing at the bottom.

637
00:41:54,520 --> 00:42:08,200
Rym: We don't need to slide anywhere because if your boot itself is bad if we tolerate an implementation like this This is the kind of stuff like the CBD tPA that a lot of people in our government would really like to have.

638
00:42:08,521 --> 00:42:10,353
Scott: Yep, remember this evening you basically want.

639
00:42:10,373 --> 00:42:11,520
Scott: there was a decade ago.

640
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,971
Rym: You know how hard we had to fight to get that shot down.

641
00:42:14,092 --> 00:42:15,800
Scott: what will happen here if this goes?

642
00:42:16,121 --> 00:42:27,520
Scott: You know full-on if no one makes motherboards that don't have this anymore is you'll basically Have to buy as soon as it comes out the last motherboard CPU combination that doesn't have this bullshit funny.

643
00:42:28,441 --> 00:42:30,568
Scott: When are you going to be able to upgrade?

644
00:42:30,668 --> 00:42:35,873
Rym: never I remember in 2002. give or take posting the Posting or reading.

645
00:42:35,994 --> 00:42:36,720
Rym: I don't remember.

646
00:42:36,883 --> 00:42:46,252
Rym: You know I'm an old man But that exact argument was made in 2002 because if the CBD tPA had passed We would have all had to buy the last free hardware

647
00:42:46,452 --> 00:42:46,673
Scott: yep,

648
00:42:47,054 --> 00:42:52,900
Rym: and then from there forth somehow We would had to make do and there would have been an underground in illegal technology.

649
00:42:53,301 --> 00:42:55,369
Scott: Oh, well not necessarily legal right in that case.

650
00:42:55,429 --> 00:42:57,135
Rym: It would have been at least in this case.

651
00:42:57,255 --> 00:43:00,900
Scott: It's not illegal technology It's simply not Microsoft certified technology.

652
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:10,295
Scott: So I would hope now that there would be a some Chinese some manufacturer of hardware that would Continue to make non certified stuff and we thought we could get it on new way.

653
00:43:10,316 --> 00:43:13,531
Rym: governments of the world Not to sound paranoid have a vested interest.

654
00:43:13,813 --> 00:43:18,880
Rym: the idea of trusted computing Flies pretty much directly in the face of free computing.

655
00:43:19,003 --> 00:43:19,578
Rym: What is made?

656
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,749
Rym: Technology great and open communication to the world forever the computer.

657
00:43:23,769 --> 00:43:35,285
Rym: the idea that we can have a generic computing thing a machine that does Computations that can do any kind of computation has probably revolutionized mankind more than anything else We've ever done in our entire history.

658
00:43:35,345 --> 00:43:35,847
Scott: and the road.

659
00:43:35,887 --> 00:43:36,931
Scott: We're going down now.

660
00:43:37,193 --> 00:43:48,524
Scott: iPad iPod all Mac Everything is a road where the you can buy machines that are theoretically capable of computing anything but Forces beyond your control.

661
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:57,670
Scott: companies and governments are going to design that hardware in such a way that they will decide what computations those things can perform and what they cannot.

662
00:43:58,171 --> 00:44:10,900
Scott: and it might even get so if they put it in the hardware and There is no hardware company on earth that cooperates It may get to the point where even nerds won't be able to compute whatever they want to compute now.

663
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:11,520
Rym: It's fine.

664
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:16,460
Rym: If we have divergent paths like an iPad that's really locked down is fine in an ecosystem.

665
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,700
Scott: It's okay for it to exist.

666
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:26,680
Rym: It just can't be the only exactly in an ecosystem where there are also free computers But without free access to your own hardware to do whatever you want with.

667
00:44:27,121 --> 00:44:30,612
Rym: You know short of you know, if I fill it with c4 and blow it up.

668
00:44:30,672 --> 00:44:31,816
Rym: Well, that's a bomb.

669
00:44:31,856 --> 00:44:33,060
Rym: That's not a computer, right?

670
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:50,040
Rym: but The fact that computing devices are open and free and then I can I can type whatever the fuck I want into that thing is Probably one of the most important things humans can do right now Because ideas and memes are the only way to fight things that we perceive as being bad in the world.

671
00:44:50,765 --> 00:44:52,840
Scott: So there's there's an additional issue here, right?

672
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,606
Scott: Which is the GPL v3.

673
00:44:54,787 --> 00:45:13,739
Scott: now some people use the GPL v3 and some aren't but in fact What happened is because of the TVO which I already explained the GPL v3 in most of its uses has clauses Specifically not allowing the TVO trick of you know, you're only allowing signed whatever's.

674
00:45:14,261 --> 00:45:17,891
Scott: So in fact what Ubuntu is doing to get around this problem?

675
00:45:17,971 --> 00:45:27,869
Scott: because right part of what they are doing is not using grub2 as their bootloader anymore because That would violate the GPL v3.

676
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:30,460
Scott: for them to do what they're doing to get around the secure boot.

677
00:45:31,346 --> 00:45:40,099
Scott: So they're actually switching to an Intel Bootloader for the later Ubuntu versions that has a more open license than the GPL v3.

678
00:45:41,042 --> 00:45:47,664
Scott: Well, so it's gonna be really weird to see what happens because suddenly you might get it, you know Linux itself is GPL v2.

679
00:45:47,684 --> 00:46:02,700
Scott: So it's still cool, but we might get into situations coming up where you know You've got a new computer You've managed to get around secure boot to install the OS you want but no GPL v3 software can be run on your computer.

680
00:46:03,362 --> 00:46:07,678
Scott: Be unless you know you you know without violating the GPL v3.

681
00:46:08,261 --> 00:46:11,071
Scott: So it's gonna get shaky real shaky.

682
00:46:11,091 --> 00:46:15,951
Rym: Well, that's that's a separate problem of Free as in beer free as in speech.

683
00:46:15,971 --> 00:46:18,080
Rym: I like and free as in GNU.

684
00:46:18,284 --> 00:46:27,049
Scott: Yeah but the free there is stuff that is freezing GNU and there's might be some divergence and some troubles and Get a certain program to run where I

685
00:46:27,571 --> 00:46:38,920
Rym: want pragmatism to prevail in that I Am less concerned about binary blob like Nvidia drivers than I am about hardware restrictions

686
00:46:40,044 --> 00:46:40,225
Scott: You know.

687
00:46:40,265 --> 00:46:49,987
Scott: and then there's always the concern we bring up all the time Which is like even if we come out of this, okay, and nerds can still buy open motherboards and CPUs a new egg Great.

688
00:46:50,027 --> 00:47:00,132
Scott: We're still in that situation where Yeah, we told you so a hundred times Nerds have freedom and no one else does the CBD tPA passes.

689
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:06,497
Rym: that would have meant that if I made a mashup of my little pony Normal people could not watch it.

690
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:15,909
Rym: Hardware could not play media at the hardware level unless that media was signed by government Bodies saying it was legit and not pirated.

691
00:47:16,591 --> 00:47:17,714
Rym: think about that for a minute.

692
00:47:17,975 --> 00:47:19,440
Rym: Think about what that would do to free speech.

693
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:23,749
Rym: Hardware restrictions like this are basically attempts at that.

694
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:27,859
Scott: Yep, and if you look at something like the iPad you could totally get there.

695
00:47:29,864 --> 00:47:35,634
Rym: We're fine with the iPad being there But imagine a world where iPad is the only way to compute and it's already.

696
00:47:35,674 --> 00:47:36,135
Scott: and it's not.

697
00:47:36,215 --> 00:47:40,039
Rym: even you can't write an ad Unless the government says it's okay to write an ad.

698
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:40,683
Rym: I imagine that.

699
00:47:40,703 --> 00:47:41,206
Scott: and it's not.

700
00:47:41,307 --> 00:47:44,003
Scott: and the thing is it's even take the government out of it right.

701
00:47:44,426 --> 00:47:58,579
Scott: if we merely get to the point where Consumers like it the most so it becomes the most popular Right, then even if governments aren't forcing you to do that and all the nerds have open computers where they can do whatever they want Normal people won't have them.

702
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:12,672
Scott: so if you make open media right and you know Apple or some corporate gatekeeper doesn't like you you can't get it spread out there because Everyone is using these lockdown things even though they don't have to Side argument.

703
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:22,340
Rym: as long as we have real open computing platforms Then the nerds who care can use those platforms to circumvent the controls on other.

704
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:29,800
Scott: But we still need the open platform to be the most popular platform Even if I don't know if that's feasible in the modern.

705
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:30,483
Rym: That's what I'm saying.

706
00:48:30,503 --> 00:48:39,116
Scott: That's the problem is that even if governments don't force a close even if you're not forced You're arguing that Huxley is the dystopia as opposed to Orwell.

707
00:48:39,276 --> 00:48:53,479
Scott: if the closeness Right of iPad and you know secure boot systems become the most popular most widely spread systems then the government doesn't have to step in and it beat you to get the same effect.

708
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:57,615
Scott: and Basically, we're only nerds are living free and everyone else is living locked down.

709
00:48:57,635 --> 00:49:01,540
Scott: I Still my choice and they wouldn't choose to leave.

710
00:49:01,741 --> 00:49:14,320
Rym: I still think it's a separate argument because in this case this hardware lockdown is Much more immediate in effect and harder to route around Mm-hmm, at least if it's just software like lockdown platforms.

711
00:49:14,782 --> 00:49:19,140
Rym: Then there the fact that the open platforms can be ubiquitous even if they're the minority.

712
00:49:19,782 --> 00:49:27,915
Rym: It's sort of a checks and balances where even if iPads are most popular if someone does something on the open platform That non nerd see and go hey, how come?

713
00:49:27,975 --> 00:49:28,639
Rym: I can't do that?

714
00:49:29,001 --> 00:49:33,120
Rym: It puts pressure on the lockdown platform to allow analogous functionality.

715
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:42,710
Scott: I could see and like a few years right when Windows 7 isn't really any good anymore and Windows 8 and 9 or whatever and OS X the only other choices Going back to full-on Linux.

716
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:44,199
Scott: We're seeing steam come out on Linux.

717
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:49,139
Scott: I bet valve this is at least you know, they're at least thinking about this a little tiny fraction of a bit.

718
00:49:49,747 --> 00:49:50,540
Scott: You know of what?

719
00:49:51,200 --> 00:50:03,860
Rym: That's why as long as we can keep open access to hardware then it'll always be a pendulum because whenever Government or corporate intrusion gets too high and starts restricting what people actually want to do with their technology.

720
00:50:04,484 --> 00:50:10,819
Rym: Those people will go to their nerd friends and say hey How come I can't do all those things because you bought an iPad or Windows 8 computer dumbass.

721
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,890
Rym: That's why there have been periods in my life.

722
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:15,937
Rym: You know, I've been using computers for a long time.

723
00:50:15,977 --> 00:50:16,640
Rym: We're old now.

724
00:50:16,901 --> 00:50:29,660
Rym: we've known GeekNights since 2005 and There have been eras where there have been big shifts in normal ish people toward Linux because they'd say hey I want to do X and Y and they couldn't really do that on their more closed platforms.

725
00:50:30,303 --> 00:50:38,723
Rym: if the iPad model gets too closed and Nerds continue to do cool things there will always be this pushback But no close.

726
00:50:38,943 --> 00:50:41,713
Scott: but how will normal people know about the cool things nerds do?

727
00:50:41,873 --> 00:50:46,119
Scott: because nerds never shut the fuck up But they can't see us on the internet because they're all locked down.

728
00:50:46,541 --> 00:50:49,753
Rym: They can see us on the internet because at least for now.

729
00:50:49,853 --> 00:50:51,278
Rym: Yes, and that's the for now.

730
00:50:51,318 --> 00:51:01,986
Rym: That's why That's why as much as we complain about this stuff the CBD tPA was literally the worst most Egregious attempt at this.

731
00:51:02,248 --> 00:51:04,760
Scott: Anyway, here's my pragmatic strategy for the near future.

732
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:05,523
Scott: Right number one.

733
00:51:05,644 --> 00:51:13,732
Scott: if this becomes so prevalent that like every motherboard has it you can't build, you know I'm planning to build a computer like two three years away, but I might wow You're really gonna hold out two or three years.

734
00:51:13,813 --> 00:51:14,499
Scott: my computer's just fun.

735
00:51:14,861 --> 00:51:16,144
Rym: I guess you're not editing video.

736
00:51:16,786 --> 00:51:22,200
Scott: if I have to I'll just buy the last great computer that doesn't have this bullshit.

737
00:51:23,222 --> 00:51:39,411
Scott: If there's still like some motherboard companies that are still producing good, you know And CPU companies still making computers that don't have the bullshit or have ways around it that they just they say Yeah, the motherboard was selling a new egg doesn't need to say Windows 8 compatible on the on the box You know, then we're pretty good, right?

738
00:51:39,431 --> 00:51:40,417
Scott: We can just buy those motherboards.

739
00:51:40,437 --> 00:51:40,940
Scott: We'll be all set.

740
00:51:42,081 --> 00:51:52,760
Scott: If it gets bad and there isn't a motherboard that's like that or a CPU that's like that Then I'm gonna start a Kickstarter to get enough monies to get like aces or someone to make a motherboard like that.

741
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,480
Rym: Yeah, and secure boot will make sure that your web browser can't go to that Kickstarter.

742
00:51:58,283 --> 00:52:00,030
Scott: I don't think no secure boot at least for now.

743
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:02,760
Scott: No slippery slope is just operating system.

744
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,850
Scott: So it's really just an issue.

745
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:06,297
Rym: and other than ARM it is.

746
00:52:07,442 --> 00:52:12,420
Rym: Actually even with ARM in certain situations is circumventable, but it pushes normal consumers.

747
00:52:12,761 --> 00:52:15,510
Rym: It adds a barrier to the even makes it hard.

748
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:18,420
Scott: you even you couldn't even run Windows XP on such a computer.

749
00:52:18,721 --> 00:52:21,993
Scott: Yeah, your Windows 7 even right unless maybe they sign that.

750
00:52:22,073 --> 00:52:25,185
Scott: but the thing is you it would be hard to run Something that was.

751
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:28,459
Rym: the idea of a secure platform that I can enable is awesome.

752
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:32,960
Scott: If I'm running a company that they just give me give me the feature and let me choose.

753
00:52:33,181 --> 00:52:34,305
Scott: Yeah, what the key is?

754
00:52:34,406 --> 00:52:38,020
Rym: I run the IT of a small company that has like sensitive financial information.

755
00:52:38,422 --> 00:52:41,858
Rym: Yeah, everyone gets a laptop with an encrypted hard drive and a crazy secure boot.

756
00:52:42,199 --> 00:52:47,520
Scott: Yep Bam done, but you can't force I have to be the one to put the key in the secure boot.

757
00:52:47,685 --> 00:52:52,740
Scott: I you know I can't have a lock on my house or someone else decides what the lock looks like and holds all the keys.

758
00:52:53,161 --> 00:52:55,972
Scott: I can't open my house unless Microsoft opens it for me.

759
00:52:56,032 --> 00:52:58,059
Rym: It's the same fundamental problem with self-signed SSL.

760
00:52:58,421 --> 00:53:04,461
Rym: It's why if you want to use SSL and anyone's using it other than you You pretty much have to pay one of the gatekeepers for you Like

761
00:53:04,501 --> 00:53:09,459
Scott: if you mortgage the house and every time you wanted to go in or out the bank came to open and close the door And lock it for you.

762
00:53:10,025 --> 00:53:12,524
Scott: And if you fucked up on the mortgage payment They would just lock you out.

763
00:53:12,565 --> 00:53:16,589
Rym: and if it's like Cisco's cloud thing if they find porn in your house Then they shut your house down.

764
00:53:16,871 --> 00:53:22,191
Rym: Yeah All right, so ravel about this stuff kids ravel ravel ravel ravel.

765
00:53:22,312 --> 00:53:27,526
Scott: sign the EFF whatever's secure boot rest You know, whatever they want to call it restricted boot.

766
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:28,850
Rym: You don't understand anything.

767
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:31,497
Rym: We said just remember this UEFI is a UFIA.

768
00:53:40,681 --> 00:53:42,928
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
