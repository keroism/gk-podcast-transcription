1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,307
Rym: It's Thursday, May 31st, 2012.

2
00:00:12,307 --> 00:00:12,808
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,108 --> 00:00:13,710
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:14,992
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,052 --> 00:00:18,720
Rym: Tonight, I'm finally back from Istanbul, and I got stuff to say.

6
00:00:20,801 --> 00:00:21,818
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,602 --> 00:00:27,678
Rym: About the TSA.

8
00:00:29,561 --> 00:00:30,565
Rym: Actually, I don't.

9
00:00:31,027 --> 00:00:32,472
Rym: Remember when I went to India?

10
00:00:32,613 --> 00:00:34,380
Rym: Pretend I said the exact same thing again.

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,102
Scott: Okay.

12
00:00:35,283 --> 00:00:35,806
Scott: Seriously.

13
00:00:36,168 --> 00:00:38,058
Rym: The only anecdote I have on that front is that...

14
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,220
Scott: Well, cause didn't you fly from like Turkey to Germany at one point?

15
00:00:41,622 --> 00:00:43,070
Rym: I flew from the US to Istanbul.

16
00:00:43,392 --> 00:00:44,840
Rym: From Istanbul to Munich.

17
00:00:45,261 --> 00:00:48,040
Scott: Right, so that Istanbul-Munich flight, the security was probably nothing, right?

18
00:00:48,342 --> 00:00:50,800
Rym: The security took maybe five minutes total.

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,299
Scott: And you didn't have to take off shoes?

20
00:00:52,524 --> 00:00:52,658
Scott: Nope.

21
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:53,360
Scott: Or open bags?

22
00:00:53,403 --> 00:00:53,490
Scott: Nope.

23
00:00:53,923 --> 00:00:54,640
Scott: Or any nonsense?

24
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,320
Rym: So, the flight from Munich to Dusseldorf... Dusseldorf?

25
00:01:00,003 --> 00:01:00,104
Rym: I won.

26
00:01:00,749 --> 00:01:02,100
Rym: There was basically no security.

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,233
Scott: I use a Swedish accent.

28
00:01:03,294 --> 00:01:03,780
Scott: Pretty German.

29
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,060
Rym: Yet somehow they checked it out more thoroughly than the TSA ever has.

30
00:01:07,823 --> 00:01:12,140
Rym: It took literally less than a minute to get through security at that airport.

31
00:01:12,621 --> 00:01:21,200
Rym: I could have shown up to my flight at the airport, as in the front of the airport, five minutes before I had to be on the plane.

32
00:01:21,683 --> 00:01:24,380
Rym: And I would have made it on the plane with about three minutes to spare.

33
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:25,600
Scott: How about that?

34
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,524
Rym: It was amazing.

35
00:01:26,926 --> 00:01:28,714
Rym: Seriously, fuck you.

36
00:01:28,734 --> 00:01:29,537
Rym: The TSA.

37
00:01:31,061 --> 00:01:37,659
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you might say, "Oh, well, how many hijackings have there been on German-Turkish

38
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,080
Scott: flights?".

39
00:01:40,022 --> 00:01:42,333
Scott: And Turkey isn't exactly the most stable place.

40
00:01:42,354 --> 00:01:43,600
Scott: There's angry people there.

41
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:50,831
Rym: Well, even more interesting was that when I was in Terminal 1 at JFK to fly out to Istanbul in the first part, that's like the international terminal.

42
00:01:50,871 --> 00:01:52,660
Rym: It's mostly just airlines that go to other cities.

43
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,240
Scott: Yeah, it's not nearly as nice as the JetBlue one.

44
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,123
Rym: Nah, it's pretty crappy.

45
00:01:55,223 --> 00:01:59,400
Rym: But it was mostly foreigners flying back home when I happened to be flying out.

46
00:02:00,102 --> 00:02:06,160
Rym: And the security line, at one point, basically this TSA guy had to keep pulling an Otakon staff.

47
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,970
Rym: "You must remove your shoes before you can get...".

48
00:02:11,234 --> 00:02:12,638
Rym: And no one would take their shoes off.

49
00:02:12,658 --> 00:02:13,360
Rym: Like, they didn't get it.

50
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,560
Scott: Because they didn't understand English, a lot of people probably.

51
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,020
Rym: And when they got it, the looks on their faces ranged from disgusted to aghast.

52
00:02:21,022 --> 00:02:22,690
Rym: This one British lady was just like, "What?

53
00:02:22,891 --> 00:02:23,956
Rym: Ugh, these fucking

54
00:02:24,017 --> 00:02:24,559
Rym: Americans.".

55
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,246
Scott: That's right.

56
00:02:26,135 --> 00:02:26,499
Rym: Fuck us.

57
00:02:26,942 --> 00:02:28,227
Rym: Yeah, it sucks.

58
00:02:28,328 --> 00:02:29,935
Rym: To the rest of the world, I apologize.

59
00:02:30,015 --> 00:02:31,020
Rym: anytime you have to fly here.

60
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,599
Scott: Grandma's always trying to say, "Do not conflate my opinions with

61
00:02:35,619 --> 00:02:35,780
Scott: Scott's.".

62
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,468
Scott: Nah, nah, nah.

63
00:02:36,529 --> 00:02:43,780
Scott: In this case... Do not conflate our beliefs and opinions with the behaviors of our government.

64
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,706
Rym: Specifically the TSA.

65
00:02:45,786 --> 00:02:51,569
Rym: Because I signed... Rand Paul, for those of you who aren't American, is a crazy idiot, but he's in our political system.

66
00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:54,260
Rym: He's the son of Ron Paul, who is also a crazy idiot.

67
00:02:55,081 --> 00:03:00,700
Rym: So, Rand Paul is trying to put forth real legislation to literally abolish the TSA.

68
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:07,160
Rym: I signed his petition, and I think he is one of the craziest people I have ever seen in American politics.

69
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,899
Scott: You can go around to the craziest of crazy people, right?

70
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,440
Rym: You can take a clock and fucking break it, and it'll still be right at least once a day.

71
00:03:15,841 --> 00:03:15,882
Scott: No.

72
00:03:15,902 --> 00:03:18,214
Scott: A clock depends how it's broken.

73
00:03:18,295 --> 00:03:21,635
Scott: If it's stopped... See, everyone says a broken clock is right twice a day.

74
00:03:21,675 --> 00:03:22,340
Scott: That's not correct.

75
00:03:22,781 --> 00:03:24,908
Scott: A stopped clock is right twice a day.

76
00:03:24,928 --> 00:03:28,960
Scott: A fast or a slow clock is never right.

77
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,810
Rym: Actually, it will be right.

78
00:03:30,931 --> 00:03:32,220
Rym: There's modulus math involved.

79
00:03:32,661 --> 00:03:35,960
Scott: Yeah, once a year or month, depending on how slow it is or something like that.

80
00:03:36,844 --> 00:03:38,999
Scott: But it's right less often than twice a day.

81
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,447
Rym: I argue that you're wrong.

82
00:03:40,467 --> 00:03:42,560
Rym: Do you want my argument?

83
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:43,280
Scott: Alright.

84
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,740
Rym: Alright, I'm gonna make a clock that moves four times faster than it should.

85
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:49,299
Scott: Oh, then it's right even more often.

86
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,460
Rym: How many times right is it per day?

87
00:03:51,702 --> 00:03:53,280
Scott: But let me ask you this question.

88
00:03:54,021 --> 00:03:55,950
Scott: Rand Paul, Ron Paul, take your pick, right?

89
00:03:56,532 --> 00:03:58,200
Scott: Fast clocks or slow clocks?

90
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,399
Rym: I'd rather a clock be fast.

91
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,992
Scott: But I'm saying they are slow clocks.

92
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:04,560
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

93
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,660
Rym: To say that they are slow clocks is an understatement.

94
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:07,958
Scott: They are not fast clocks.

95
00:04:09,023 --> 00:04:10,960
Rym: Not the fastest clocks in the chat by any stretch.

96
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,300
Scott: Indeed, they may be stopped clocks, which are right twice a day.

97
00:04:14,781 --> 00:04:19,620
Scott: But they are neither fast nor are they accurately keeping time.

98
00:04:19,741 --> 00:04:21,308
Rym: They are either slow or stopped.

99
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,520
Rym: I think Ron Paul's is slow.

100
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,291
Rym: And/or maybe stopped.

101
00:04:27,332 --> 00:04:28,040
Rym: Probably just slow.

102
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,760
Rym: Because he's trying to hold his back.

103
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,600
Scott: Well, slow is actually right less often than stopped, right?

104
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,060
Scott: Stopped is right twice a day.

105
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,500
Scott: Slow is right, you know, depends how slow it is.

106
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,600
Scott: It could be so slow, right, that it actually goes backwards.

107
00:04:41,301 --> 00:04:42,699
Scott: And then it's right pretty often.

108
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,560
Rym: I think Rand Paul is more the erratic clock.

109
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:48,600
Rym: Where the hands just materialize at random positions over time.

110
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,659
Scott: Well, then there's absolutely no way to know how often it's right.

111
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,054
Rym: You know what the Rand Paul clock does is periodically it says, "See, what you've got is fiat

112
00:04:55,115 --> 00:04:55,479
Rym: time.".

113
00:04:57,403 --> 00:04:58,780
Scott: Okay, let's move on here.

114
00:04:59,863 --> 00:05:07,939
Rym: The only reason I even brought up stupid Rand Paul TSI is that I was reading FARC at the airport on my way on the trip, right?

115
00:05:09,482 --> 00:05:10,608
Rym: And there was an article.

116
00:05:10,628 --> 00:05:12,740
Rym: It was a technology article.

117
00:05:12,921 --> 00:05:14,239
Rym: I forget even what it was about.

118
00:05:15,062 --> 00:05:18,260
Rym: And the first comment was three paragraphs.

119
00:05:18,523 --> 00:05:19,252
Rym: And I have a new...

120
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:22,200
Scott: The first post or just the top comment?

121
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,299
Rym: The first post.

122
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:29,472
Rym: And I have a new... I think this might be a law of the internet, but I need a lot more data on it.

123
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:35,200
Rym: If someone is a Rand or Ron Paul... I could make a regular expression.

124
00:05:36,362 --> 00:05:38,138
Rym: R dot star...

125
00:05:38,524 --> 00:05:39,320
Scott: R star Paul?

126
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,760
Rym: Yeah, some sort of regex.

127
00:05:41,581 --> 00:05:52,900
Rym: If you're one of those supporters, you cannot post anything on the internet without mentioning fiat currency and Eurozone, Global Reserve, or Federal Reserve, or IMF.

128
00:05:53,301 --> 00:05:58,120
Rym: At least two of those things within two sentences of any post on the internet.

129
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,319
Rym: So anyway, what did I miss?

130
00:06:01,463 --> 00:06:01,806
Scott: Not much.

131
00:06:01,867 --> 00:06:09,860
Scott: So the only news I got, at least it was the first news that I found when I was looking through my news list here, is that Toonami has returned.

132
00:06:11,285 --> 00:06:12,299
Rym: Ah, is it the turn of the tide?

133
00:06:12,885 --> 00:06:13,127
Scott: No.

134
00:06:13,531 --> 00:06:14,520
Scott: So here's what happened, right?

135
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,036
Scott: So on May 26th, Adult Swim posted a message that was like, "Toonami's actually coming back for

136
00:06:20,117 --> 00:06:20,360
Scott: reals.".

137
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:24,040
Scott: Because remember they had the adult... They had the April Fools comeback.

138
00:06:24,181 --> 00:06:26,258
Scott: that was sort of like the fake comeback, you know?

139
00:06:27,265 --> 00:06:28,260
Scott: But now it's come back for reals.

140
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,080
Scott: So they brought it back for reals.

141
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:46,799
Scott: And basically what they did is they took their existing sort of Adult Swim anime block, and they added two shows, Casern Sins and Deadman Wonderland, and they put them up at midnight on some day for a bunch of hours.

142
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:55,910
Scott: And there was a tweet today, or yesterday, I think it was today, of the guy who runs it, I guess, and he was like, "The ratings were okay.

143
00:06:56,011 --> 00:06:57,466
Scott: Not the greatest, but they were

144
00:06:57,588 --> 00:06:58,136
Scott: okay.".

145
00:06:58,743 --> 00:06:59,611
Scott: And it's like, "Oh,

146
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:00,539
Scott: okay.".

147
00:07:01,962 --> 00:07:07,508
Scott: People were clamoring because I don't know about you, but I would get home from school and watch Toonami every freaking day.

148
00:07:07,548 --> 00:07:08,640
Rym: Ah, but that's the problem.

149
00:07:08,903 --> 00:07:09,630
Rym: What did you just say?

150
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,064
Scott: It was on at midnight.

151
00:07:11,327 --> 00:07:14,237
Rym: You would get home from school to watch Toonami.

152
00:07:14,257 --> 00:07:14,500
Rym: Exactly.

153
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,500
Rym: It was on when normal people watched things.

154
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,509
Scott: Exactly, right.

155
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:19,880
Rym: In an era when television and time mattered.

156
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:26,983
Scott: So yeah, not only does television no longer matter in this day, as opposed to the day when I was in high school and middle school, right?

157
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:38,140
Scott: But in addition, you want to make a particular kind of thing popular, it's gotta be on when people are watching, and when do kids watch when they get home from school, right?

158
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:47,103
Scott: "Bring Back Toonami" doesn't mean, "Okay, show some shows that you're already gonna show probably, and the bumpers in between those shows have Tom the Robot in

159
00:07:47,143 --> 00:07:47,244
Scott: them.".

160
00:07:47,264 --> 00:07:48,740
Scott: That's not what "Bring Back Toonami" means.

161
00:07:49,040 --> 00:08:12,318
Scott: "Bring Back Toonami" means that between like 2.33 and 6.7 night, every single weekday, you show a block of nerdy programming ranging from, you know, Herculoids, Hanna-Barbera, Space Ghost to B-Test, to Gundam, to Dragon Ball, to brand new animes, you know, who knows what.

162
00:08:12,763 --> 00:08:13,620
Scott: Bleach, I don't even care.

163
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,344
Scott: You got it.

164
00:08:14,425 --> 00:08:14,647
Scott: Show it.

165
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,060
Scott: That's what "Bring Back Toonami" means.

166
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,420
Rym: Well now, that's what "Bring Back Toonami" means to people who understand the importance of Toonami.

167
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:29,140
Rym: Most people are on a weird nostalgia trip, and this is not targeted at what the original Toonami did, which is getting people into these things.

168
00:08:29,502 --> 00:08:36,919
Rym: This is targeted at making those people who have nostalgia for Toonami become marketable too with ads on TV.

169
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:43,485
Scott: Yeah, sell some slightly more expensive ads and maybe a few more spots at a time period where we're not selling so many ads.

170
00:08:43,506 --> 00:08:43,828
Rym: Exactly.

171
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:48,760
Rym: They put it on a bad time period because they're only selling to people who want to watch Toonami.

172
00:08:48,901 --> 00:08:49,042
Rym: Yeah,

173
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:49,324
Scott: remember,

174
00:08:49,466 --> 00:08:50,192
Rym: when the TV executives

175
00:08:51,242 --> 00:09:04,759
Scott: are looking at the program schedule, they're looking at dollars per second across the whole board, so if there's an area that's weak in dollars per second, that's the area they reprogram to get the dollars per second of advertising money in that time slot on that day to go up.

176
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:05,891
Scott: That's what they do.

177
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:32,640
Scott: So anyway, but I just want to reiterate a point that I have made many times, you know, that is a more general point, and this is just another example of it, so whenever you find a new example of something, you gotta, you know, is that companies these days, especially companies that have existed for a while, they like to pretend to try new things and then say that they did or did not or partially worked or partially didn't work based on only dipping the toe in the water.

178
00:09:33,422 --> 00:09:37,003
Scott: So for the greatest example, of course, is the digitization of things, right?

179
00:09:37,084 --> 00:09:40,540
Scott: It's like, "Okay, guys, we will sell you, you know, music

180
00:09:40,661 --> 00:09:41,206
Scott: digitally.".

181
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:51,330
Scott: So they dip the toe in the water, and it's like, "Okay, we sold you a few of the tracks for $5 each with some DRMs and only in this one place, and it only worked on

182
00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:51,916
Scott: iPods.".

183
00:09:51,956 --> 00:09:57,853
Scott: It's like, you only dipped the toe in, of course it didn't fucking work, and then they try to say, "Oh, some digital music doesn't work,".

184
00:09:57,874 --> 00:10:00,095
Scott: 'cause you didn't jump in the pool.

185
00:10:00,115 --> 00:10:11,953
Scott: If you actually jump in the pool and go whole hog on something, that is the only time you can determine whether it does or does not work, but there is no dispute you risk drowning when you jump in the pool, right?

186
00:10:11,974 --> 00:10:21,953
Scott: So everyone's so afraid of drowning, they won't jump in the pool for anything, and because no one jumps in the pool for anything, no one can actually prove or disprove that things do or do not work.

187
00:10:21,994 --> 00:10:44,719
Scott: If you just want to say, "Bringing back Toonami would or would not work," you cannot say that unless you do exactly what we said, which is every day, after school, for a long period of time, at least long enough to get an audience, to build an audience, these things don't happen overnight, you know, it takes investment and, you know, risking of drowning, and that's the only way that you can make a determination of it will or will not work.

188
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:49,627
Scott: Unless you do that, you can't be like, "Oh, the rainings are okay, you didn't do

189
00:10:49,688 --> 00:10:49,769
Scott: it!".

190
00:10:50,093 --> 00:10:54,818
Scott: You're putting your pinky toe in the water and saying, "Oh, I can't swim, I'll drown if I

191
00:10:54,858 --> 00:10:55,040
Scott: swim.".

192
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,085
Scott: You don't know that, you just put your toe in the water.

193
00:10:57,187 --> 00:11:00,320
Rym: Well, the thing is they don't need to, the majority of people don't think of this or care.

194
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:06,879
Scott: No, no, no, I'm not giving that particular example, but I mean, in general, companies like to say, "This works, this doesn't work,".

195
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,103
Scott: but you haven't done it, so you don't know, right?

196
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,871
Scott: You know, Hasbro, make toys that don't have brushy hair, right?

197
00:11:13,891 --> 00:11:16,299
Scott: They just have solid hair that looks exactly like the show.

198
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,820
Scott: You won't know if they will sell or won't, even though they will.

199
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,687
Rym: Well, we know they will because of the sheer amount of bootlegs.

200
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:28,678
Scott: Right, but, you know, why, you know, even though we do know that, mostly, we're pretty sure, you don't know because you haven't done it.

201
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,659
Scott: So, you know, there you go.

202
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:39,019
Rym: So, you know, not too long after I got back, I actually went out because people were losing their shit about The Avengers, the new movie, so I figured, you know what, I'll go see it.

203
00:11:39,261 --> 00:11:40,091
Scott: You went to see it in the theater?

204
00:11:40,111 --> 00:11:40,800
Rym: So I went to see it in the theater.

205
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,668
Scott: Whether they were screaming babies or kids or loud people or tall people in the way?

206
00:11:45,688 --> 00:11:46,400
Rym: Nah, it was mostly full.

207
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,420
Rym: It wasn't that bad, I went to a nice theater, it was okay.

208
00:11:48,622 --> 00:11:50,400
Rym: But, uh, it was okay.

209
00:11:51,384 --> 00:11:56,240
Rym: It was a mediocre to average, like, okay, pretty enjoyable movie.

210
00:11:56,743 --> 00:12:02,880
Rym: But it was literally nothing special and I can't imagine ever needing to see it again.

211
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,260
Scott: Well, I mean, I haven't seen any superhero live-action movie, except...

212
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,210
Rym: Oh, you would have hated it.

213
00:12:07,453 --> 00:12:08,100
Scott: That wasn't Batman.

214
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,156
Rym: I know you would have hated it.

215
00:12:10,176 --> 00:12:11,894
Scott: I saw the first Spider-Man one, recent one.

216
00:12:11,914 --> 00:12:15,188
Rym: You hate quips, you hate one-liners, you hate Joss Whedon, you would hate everything about this movie.

217
00:12:15,229 --> 00:12:19,895
Scott: Well, I like one-liners if they're good, but a one-liner can't carry a movie, right?

218
00:12:19,915 --> 00:12:23,936
Scott: One-liners are for, you know, Simpsons episodes, Futuramas, or...

219
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,864
Rym: Don't forget, uh, Total Recall.

220
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,540
Rym: See you at the party, Richter.

221
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,660
Scott: Right, but I mean, Total Recall.

222
00:12:30,822 --> 00:12:32,357
Rym: He could have said, "Do you need a

223
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:32,680
Rym: hand?".

224
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,772
Scott: It has one-liners.

225
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:35,147
Scott: I mean, I haven't even seen this, right?

226
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:38,540
Scott: But it's like, are you telling me that one-liners are what carries the movie?

227
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,207
Scott: That's all it's got.

228
00:12:39,248 --> 00:12:39,511
Rym: No, no, no.

229
00:12:39,531 --> 00:12:45,432
Rym: What I'm saying is that the one-liners that were there were really good and there were a lot of great scenes that were very satisfying.

230
00:12:45,472 --> 00:12:56,460
Rym: It was a fun movie, but it was about 45 minutes too long and it had two extra Avengers and the soundtrack was, I can't even say forgettable, it was garbage.

231
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,092
Rym: I literally...

232
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,298
Scott: Like, you hear the music and you're like, "Ah, turn this music

233
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:00,480
Scott: off.".

234
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,976
Rym: So, during dramatic scenes, I'm listening to the music and I'm like, "Wow, this is what, like, a high school kid would think was...".

235
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,460
Scott: Like it stands out as sort of cheesy and misplaced?

236
00:13:08,581 --> 00:13:10,946
Rym: It stands out as, "This is the dramatic song.

237
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:13,512
Rym: This is the song between scenes.

238
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,856
Rym: This is the song when an action scene is about to start.

239
00:13:15,937 --> 00:13:16,825
Rym: This is the ominous

240
00:13:16,866 --> 00:13:17,370
Rym: song.".

241
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:18,439
Scott: You know what I'm gonna do?

242
00:13:19,506 --> 00:13:28,300
Scott: I'm gonna make a live action US movie with English speaking people, maybe even superheroes, and I'm gonna get Yuki Kajiro or Yokohama to do the music, right?

243
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,038
Scott: No one, you know, these people, they don't work crossways, you know?

244
00:13:32,723 --> 00:13:38,600
Scott: Why don't we get Joss Whedon to write some anime and have Japanese studio IG or production IG make the show, right?

245
00:13:39,144 --> 00:13:39,570
Scott: Mix it up.

246
00:13:39,692 --> 00:13:46,460
Scott: We gotta get some cross-country workings going on, 'cause we got, you know, we got talented peoples in particular areas.

247
00:13:46,802 --> 00:13:49,592
Scott: They gotta team up with talented peoples in the other areas.

248
00:13:49,673 --> 00:13:59,780
Rym: Yuki Kajiro could've saved that movie, because the thing is, I watched one and three quarters awful shows and I thought they were good just because of that music.

249
00:14:00,481 --> 00:14:02,805
Rym: Like, it took me a while to realize the shows were garbage.

250
00:14:02,825 --> 00:14:03,411
Scott: Yeah, right.

251
00:14:03,633 --> 00:14:04,623
Rym: Noire and Dot Hack.

252
00:14:04,724 --> 00:14:06,037
Scott: I watched half of Dot Hack.

253
00:14:06,098 --> 00:14:07,188
Scott: I watched all of Noire.

254
00:14:07,391 --> 00:14:08,340
Rym: I watched all of Noire.

255
00:14:08,421 --> 00:14:10,220
Scott: Two episodes of Kazuto or whatever.

256
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:15,531
Rym: There was a point at like 12 or 13 episodes into Noire when I was like, "Eh, this isn't really that good,".

257
00:14:15,552 --> 00:14:17,879
Rym: but then the music would play and I'd be like, "Oh, this is the best show ever.

258
00:14:18,562 --> 00:14:18,866
Rym: This is

259
00:14:18,906 --> 00:14:19,229
Rym: great.".

260
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,846
Rym: But the soundtrack was like nothing.

261
00:14:23,674 --> 00:14:26,519
Rym: Dragon Heart, which actually had a pretty shit soundtrack.

262
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,251
Scott: Dragon Heart or Dragon Heat?

263
00:14:27,373 --> 00:14:27,840
Rym: Dragon Heart.

264
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,768
Scott: I'm the last one.

265
00:14:29,051 --> 00:14:34,966
Rym: I had a better soundtrack, even though it was mostly songs that are also in other movies.

266
00:14:35,027 --> 00:14:36,542
Scott: I don't remember any songs from Dragon Heart.

267
00:14:36,744 --> 00:14:39,854
Rym: There's one particular one that's in a lot of movie trailers, just for random movies.

268
00:14:40,036 --> 00:14:40,683
Rym: I have a feeling.

269
00:14:40,865 --> 00:14:41,676
Rym: Yeah.

270
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:46,680
Rym: But yeah, this movie was just average, okay, literally nothing special.

271
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,939
Scott: It's because, I'm telling you, I haven't seen it, so I don't know.

272
00:14:50,503 --> 00:14:55,194
Scott: There is a non-zero chance that I would like it, but I've never liked anything Joss Whedon's ever done, so I doubt it.

273
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:10,360
Scott: But, the point is, it's obvious that nerds, a great majority of nerds, I'm among them, I know them, they seem to like a thing just based on these surface elements.

274
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,572
Scott: And people even come to me like, "Scott, you should like this.

275
00:15:13,673 --> 00:15:16,035
Scott: It has this character in it that you

276
00:15:16,075 --> 00:15:16,338
Scott: like.".

277
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,833
Rym: Well, they tried to pull that on Avengers.

278
00:15:17,853 --> 00:15:19,852
Rym: They're like, "Scott, Thanos is in it at the end.

279
00:15:19,873 --> 00:15:20,964
Rym: He's gonna be in the next

280
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:21,125
Rym: movie.".

281
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:24,219
Scott: And it's like, why would that mean that I'm going to like it?

282
00:15:25,203 --> 00:15:27,224
Scott: What are some of my favorite characters and things?

283
00:15:27,284 --> 00:15:28,600
Rym: Kenshiro, Lupin.

284
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,660
Scott: Yeah, I always say Kenshiro and Lupin, right?

285
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:34,964
Scott: So you come to me and say, "Hey, Scott, there's a comic and Kenshiro is in

286
00:15:35,004 --> 00:15:35,045
Scott: it.".

287
00:15:35,085 --> 00:15:36,866
Scott: Well, I like Kenshiro.

288
00:15:36,886 --> 00:15:40,678
Scott: He's a cool dude, but that doesn't mean I'm going to like that thing.

289
00:15:42,603 --> 00:15:44,763
Scott: But for some people, it seems like that is true.

290
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:50,180
Scott: You could make some piece of crap and put ponies in it and some bronies in it and think it's the best thing ever, even though it sucks.

291
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:52,319
Scott: And that's what it is.

292
00:15:52,763 --> 00:16:04,040
Scott: I think that a lot of nerds, you can just take something, and as long as their favorite characters are in it, there's a good chance that they will like it, as long as it's not blatantly awful.

293
00:16:05,441 --> 00:16:07,653
Rym: Who's favorite character is Hawkeye?

294
00:16:07,714 --> 00:16:09,435
Rym: He might as well have not even been in that movie.

295
00:16:09,476 --> 00:16:10,748
Rym: He served zero purpose.

296
00:16:10,768 --> 00:16:12,179
Scott: There are people who like that.

297
00:16:12,861 --> 00:16:14,380
Rym: Hawkeye is a pointless character.

298
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,980
Rym: He literally, in this movie, they could have just cut him out and no one would have noticed.

299
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,120
Scott: Well, do you know about Hawkeye in the comics?

300
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,779
Rym: Uh, bow and arrow guy.

301
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,038
Scott: Yeah, he's a bow and arrow guy.

302
00:16:24,161 --> 00:16:25,160
Rym: That's what I know about him.

303
00:16:26,262 --> 00:16:30,220
Scott: His typical thing is he was the bad guy, he was also the good guy, he was also the bad guy.

304
00:16:30,562 --> 00:16:33,500
Rym: Oh, in this movie they brainwashed him and then he got to be the bad guy for most of the movie.

305
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:33,702
Rym: See,

306
00:16:33,722 --> 00:16:52,807
Scott: that's what I was trying to discuss earlier, but I held it, right, is that in the comics, it's actually cool, or somewhat cool, at least the first time, that he basically goes back and forth between good guy and bad guy because they replay the same story because they have no new ideas, but the original story is that he wasn't a bad guy because he was brainwashed, he was just a bad guy, right?

307
00:16:53,655 --> 00:17:00,136
Scott: And then when he becomes a good guy, he's still a bad guy, it's sort of like having a guy on your team.

308
00:17:00,196 --> 00:17:05,354
Scott: that's like, you know, Locke the thief, only sort of evil and jerky, right?

309
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,920
Scott: And you should have put him in jail.

310
00:17:08,481 --> 00:17:17,086
Scott: It's sort of like when the X-Men will team up with Magneto or, you know, they'll have to work with Doctor Doom this time, except it's different from that because he's always there.

311
00:17:17,106 --> 00:17:31,504
Scott: It's like if Doctor Doom joined the Fantastic Four permanently, and he's just always there with them and when they're looking at him, and he's always doing the right thing, but he's still Doctor Doom and he

312
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:32,152
Rym: used to be

313
00:17:34,146 --> 00:17:41,246
Scott: and he's still evil and he still says evil things and talks like an evil guy and has evil ideas and he used to be an evil, horrible dictator.

314
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:47,860
Scott: It would be like if you were like, you know, marching in to fight and like, Stalin was there right next to you, and it's Stalin, it's like what the hell are you doing here?

315
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:57,627
Scott: It's like you want to shoot him, but he's his actions at this moment are noble actions, even though all his thoughts, words, and past actions are evil.

316
00:17:58,192 --> 00:18:02,700
Scott: All of his present and future actions are good and you're keeping an eye on him.

317
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:10,095
Scott: and that's the cool part of Hawkeye, and very few comics actually draw that cool part out but that's the cool part.

318
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,299
Rym: Well anyway, my biggest complaint, and then we can move on.

319
00:18:12,622 --> 00:18:14,700
Scott: So brainwashing him completely defeats that purpose.

320
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,003
Scott: Yeah,

321
00:18:15,023 --> 00:18:27,347
Rym: well he served no purpose in the movie anyway, he was completely pointless but the movie was crazy long and there's this gigantic action scene at the end, you know, like a superhero movie, summer blockbuster but it

322
00:18:27,428 --> 00:18:28,275
Scott: had all these

323
00:18:28,396 --> 00:18:47,388
Rym: vignettes where they'd like, save particular civilians around the city, like in the course of everything, and it went on forever like, this scene just wouldn't end, and the way it played out all those vignettes in the middle of the fight, literally didn't matter at all, like they had no effect, they might as well have not been there.

324
00:18:47,691 --> 00:19:00,866
Rym: That fight could have been half as long, and it did the typical cut around all the time, there's no real choreography which is more and more common like in the Transformers movies, that I just I can't stand that kind of action scene like.

325
00:19:00,886 --> 00:19:06,854
Rym: I hate it when there's, you know they use fast cuts to cover up the fact that they didn't actually choreograph anything in three dimensional space.

326
00:19:08,643 --> 00:19:21,023
Rym: It was just a mediocre movie, that's all I can say and I predict that the next Avengers movie not gonna be received as well as this one, because they're going full Thanos space bullshit as far as I can tell.

327
00:19:21,043 --> 00:19:25,090
Scott: See the thing is, if you do the space bullshit right, and I'm a big fan of that I've read a large.

328
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,340
Rym: I think you're gonna say the same thing Emily said, so continue.

329
00:19:28,642 --> 00:19:28,784
Rym: I've

330
00:19:28,844 --> 00:19:32,095
Scott: read a large number of Marvel outer space cosmic

331
00:19:32,115 --> 00:19:33,449
Rym: comics Thanos, Infinity Gauntlet,

332
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:44,780
Scott: I've read all those and I actually like those a lot even though I recognize they're not exactly the greatest but I like them a lot, and the reason that I like them so much, is because they're crazy, psychedelic, and weird.

333
00:19:45,446 --> 00:19:56,899
Scott: right, it's like everything is sort of like Jack Kirby crackle all over the place, crazy colors and it's not people, it's not a whole lot of just fighting, and you know, I mean when they do fight they just sort of blast energy beams at each other.

334
00:19:57,385 --> 00:20:15,539
Scott: but you know, it's not really usually a matter of just I'm stronger than you or whoever wins is for the plot or something like that, right it's usually okay, you know we're shooting energy beams at each other, but what really is going on, is this sort of weird, tripped out, sort of LSD mind battles, right, that go on.

335
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:26,939
Scott: you know, it's like, you know even though on the page it's a drawing of like Adam Warlock shooting like a beam out of a scepter like a Merlin the Wizard against.

336
00:20:27,404 --> 00:20:31,603
Scott: you know, I don't know you know, Eternity, well what's Eternity?

337
00:20:31,704 --> 00:20:38,779
Scott: Eternity is this huge guy who is the living embodiment of the entire universe and all of existence, and he's like.

338
00:20:39,143 --> 00:21:00,496
Scott: he's just sort of like this outline, and of this big gigantic guy with like weird tentacle hair, and like tentacles coming out of the sides of his body sort of like Washington's you know, dicks coming out of his legs but they used a bucket tool to paint him, and the bucket tool drew stars and planets and galaxies and all sorts of stuff, and it's like they're not putting that shit, that

339
00:21:00,557 --> 00:21:00,858
Rym: fucked

340
00:21:01,018 --> 00:21:04,799
Scott: up mind trippy shit in no live action mainstream movie.

341
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:08,980
Scott: they might try, no they're not, they're not gonna have a giant guy who looks like outer space.

342
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:24,816
Rym: they're not gonna have Ego the living planet, you know floating around talking to Quasar with his quantum bands, I think the reason I think the movie's gonna be bad is more that, so they go the road of Thanos, which one, they show him but nobody knows who.

343
00:21:24,836 --> 00:21:28,113
Scott: that is right, and you know what, the other thing is well, nerds know who he is, right?

344
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:28,779
Scott: Yeah the stinger is.

345
00:21:29,244 --> 00:21:31,526
Rym: they show a guy, and if you know alright,

346
00:21:31,546 --> 00:22:04,578
Scott: so let's talk about what Thanos' deal is, Thanos is a guy from Titan, you know the moon Titan, right where there was a society of Titans, but he was sort of like right, he was sort of a runt right, sort of like a deformed runt, he's all purple and nasty and sort of giant chin, and you know you could tell he was a Titan from that planet, but he didn't fit in and he was sort of evil, so he's actually a worshipper of death, as in the Grim Reaper, except death is a god a literal existing god, who's like this lady who wears a dark robe, who's a skeleton, and she never speaks and he literally worships her.

347
00:22:05,261 --> 00:22:06,459
Scott: literally, like goes to.

348
00:22:06,601 --> 00:22:26,340
Scott: oh, there's death, the Grim Reaper and she's the god of death of the entire universe, and there's this dude worshipping her, and as a sacrifice to her, you know he wants to bring about a lot of death, so he goes and gets the infinity gauntlet, and to kill half the population of the universe with a snap of his fingers, cause he wants, you know death to like him, so he'll make out with him.

349
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,940
Rym: so here's the problem that's gonna happen, right?

350
00:22:28,301 --> 00:22:32,679
Scott: that kind of fucked up shit is not gonna go in a mainstream movie, the thing is they're bringing him in.

351
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,569
Rym: so what are they gonna do?

352
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,659
Scott: my problem is he's gonna be generic alien powerful bad guy.

353
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,337
Rym: my problem is, what's the plot gonna be?

354
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:42,700
Rym: you've got the crazy existential space stuff you know, and then you've got Hawkeye.

355
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:42,962
Rym: they're

356
00:22:42,982 --> 00:22:44,920
Scott: gonna remove any of the existential parts

357
00:22:45,686 --> 00:22:47,159
Rym: if they would just remove Hawkeye

358
00:22:48,434 --> 00:23:08,059
Scott: you know in the infinity gauntlet, when all the, basically the not dead superheroes, cause half of everyone died, right go to fight, you know Thanos, up on this giant floating castle he made, that looks go to light castle grayskull for death to live in and hang out, you know even Spiderman goes up there, and Spiderman is like, oh what the fuck am I gonna do?

359
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:15,799
Scott: he's like, well look, this guy is pretty much omnipotent, omniscient, et cetera et cetera, so even you know, your tiny web shot.

360
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:30,639
Scott: we gotta basically all punch him at the same time otherwise this isn't gonna work, so you know, everyone goes, the cosmic guys with the real powers like Silver Surfer make the real difference, but your one bow and arrow shot might do something, it couldn't hurt to have it in there.

361
00:23:31,448 --> 00:23:32,560
Scott: you know, we got no one else.

362
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:42,195
Rym: we're bringing everybody, so what I was amazed by though, was in our forum, I basically said it was a pretty good movie, but it had some flaws and people treated that like I said it was the worst movie ever, and they were bad.

363
00:23:42,236 --> 00:23:46,618
Rym: people like people defended this movie to a degree.

364
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,376
Scott: Firefly sucks.

365
00:23:48,085 --> 00:23:49,839
Scott: Firefly was pretty good, I like Firefly.

366
00:23:50,527 --> 00:23:51,660
Scott: this is welcome to my world.

367
00:23:51,781 --> 00:23:53,520
Rym: I think you're wrong about Firefly, but I digress.

368
00:23:53,882 --> 00:24:01,271
Scott: if a majority of nerds sorta agree on something for whatever reason, and you disagree they act like, you know, and then they yell at you for doing the same

369
00:24:01,311 --> 00:24:25,230
Rym: thing, I think it's more a situation of the lady doth protesteth too much, that when flaws are pointed out in something, that someone cause remember, I watched it after everyone else had already seen it and they were posting things like I'm gonna go see it a third time, oh my god that was the best movie ever, and I was like eh, it was okay, they either have to accept the flaws I pointed out, or defend their previous opinion, this is what

370
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:42,378
Scott: I'm gonna understand, it's like either a) defend your opinion which people often refuse or fail to do, or b) do what we do, which is when you like something and you know, deep in your heart, or you know, well out shallow in your heart, or in your mind that it's not that good, just admit it.

371
00:24:42,742 --> 00:24:44,058
Scott: I like Initial D, it sucks.

372
00:24:44,947 --> 00:24:48,779
Scott: if I liked Avengers enough to see it five times, I wouldn't be like all shy about it.

373
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:56,399
Rym: well, before we go any further I should make it clear to people who read the film, I don't necessarily agree with all Scott's opinions here, don't conflate me with him.

374
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,420
Scott: I'd be like yeah, I saw it five times.

375
00:24:58,541 --> 00:25:01,677
Scott: it's okay, but I love it, it's up my alley it's my thing.

376
00:25:02,743 --> 00:25:06,040
Rym: but I had people defending like why Hawkeye was in the movie, I was like really?

377
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,346
Rym: really?

378
00:25:07,366 --> 00:25:11,491
Rym: you could cut him out and not change any of the dialogue and it would still make mostly the same

379
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:12,743
Scott: sense, you should make a Hawkeye cut,

380
00:25:14,037 --> 00:25:17,064
Rym: I think I could, I won't, I don't care enough but I could,

381
00:25:17,186 --> 00:25:19,772
Scott: I mean it would take, it would be very long and it would be pretty, right, but you

382
00:25:19,792 --> 00:25:20,155
Rym: could

383
00:25:20,175 --> 00:25:20,720
Scott: do the opposite.

384
00:25:20,821 --> 00:25:29,939
Rym: the movie was so long, I almost fell asleep during the last fight and even though there's a bunch of stuff after the credits, a lot of the audience just got up and left because the movie was so long.

385
00:25:30,661 --> 00:25:31,919
Scott: did they not know?

386
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:38,700
Rym: no, there was a guy, as soon as the first credit comes up, like it's over this guy's like don't leave, don't leave.

387
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,120
Rym: there's shit after the credits, don't leave, don't leave, don't leave.

388
00:25:41,403 --> 00:25:43,460
Rym: and he got like really agitated when people started leaving.

389
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,186
Scott: did you leave?

390
00:25:46,281 --> 00:25:47,993
Rym: no, because I wanted to see what the stingers were.

391
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,420
Scott: was it worth it?

392
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:56,058
Rym: so the first one, spoilers, was the Thanos great, the second one was actually pretty good.

393
00:25:56,485 --> 00:25:57,519
Scott: was it just like a funny joke?

394
00:25:57,861 --> 00:26:02,520
Rym: yes, it was just a joke, but it was actually the way, it was really funny.

395
00:26:03,007 --> 00:26:03,800
Rym: I was really pleased with it.

396
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,219
Scott: if it was so funny, why don't you put it in the movie?

397
00:26:06,162 --> 00:26:07,760
Rym: it was better that it wasn't in the movie.

398
00:26:09,205 --> 00:26:23,411
Rym: it wouldn't have been the same joke had it been a scene in the movie and they get points for hypnototing it a little bit as in, the scene happens, and you're like oh I get it and it just sits there for a while, you just keep watching it.

399
00:26:24,841 --> 00:26:27,994
Rym: Thor's like picking it, I'm not saying what it is picking his nose?

400
00:26:28,177 --> 00:26:31,660
Rym: no they're all just out eating shawarma silently.

401
00:26:32,782 --> 00:26:37,486
Rym: they're just sitting there eating it in the kind of place you get cheap shawarma in New York,

402
00:26:37,768 --> 00:26:39,447
Scott: sort of like when Aquaman goes in that bar,

403
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:48,656
Rym: basically yeah and there's a guy in the background mopping and they're just sitting there and Thor takes a bite and he kind of just looks at it like he takes another bite and they're just sitting there.

404
00:26:49,303 --> 00:26:51,507
Scott: yeah, that's how they do it see.

405
00:26:51,527 --> 00:27:00,457
Scott: that's the kind of superhero movie I wish they would make, which is those are the parts of the superhero comics I like the most which is, guy happens to be a superhero but he's just hanging out.

406
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:06,680
Rym: he's not necessarily jumping around, punching, saving the universe all up the ante, you know what superhero movie I want?

407
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,900
Rym: I just want Batman Dark Knight Returns the movie eh, too much Batman.

408
00:27:11,021 --> 00:27:14,299
Scott: we need to go and take the superheroes that nobody knows about, no one cares about.

409
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,025
Rym: Raccoon Girl?

410
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:16,477
Scott: You mean Squirrel Girl?

411
00:27:16,557 --> 00:27:16,900
Rym: Whatever?

412
00:27:17,061 --> 00:27:17,505
Rym: I don't know.

413
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:19,140
Scott: No, no, she's only a joke.

414
00:27:19,181 --> 00:27:22,399
Rym: she's not really okay, how about that Raccoon Guy?

415
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:23,949
Scott: What Raccoon Guy?

416
00:27:23,969 --> 00:27:24,799
Rym: There's a little Raccoon Guy.

417
00:27:25,447 --> 00:27:26,216
Scott: Oh, Rocket Raccoon?

418
00:27:26,236 --> 00:27:28,292
Scott: Yeah The guy's actually a raccoon?

419
00:27:28,312 --> 00:27:29,400
Rym: Yeah, let's make a movie for him.

420
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,340
Scott: yeah, he's also outer space and sort of.

421
00:27:31,502 --> 00:27:34,140
Scott: well, he's more pulp outer space like Flash Gordon style.

422
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,020
Rym: let's make a crossover between him and Howard the Duck.

423
00:27:37,081 --> 00:27:48,880
Scott: you could actually make a really good movie that was like the Rocket Raccoon movie and you could use Beatles music if you could afford it and it could just be like sort of a Flash Gordon kind of like duh duh duh eh, right?

424
00:27:50,203 --> 00:27:50,305
Scott: maybe.

425
00:27:50,325 --> 00:27:56,599
Scott: All like action packed and, you know, sort of a little bit cheesy on purpose because he's a raccoon with a laser gun.

426
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,210
Rym: but anyway things of the day.

427
00:28:05,331 --> 00:28:10,829
Rym: so, you know, every now and then I pull out the hockey fights and it's definitely the hockey season.

428
00:28:11,671 --> 00:28:12,418
Rym: Go Kings!

429
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:13,023
Rym: Devils suck.

430
00:28:14,133 --> 00:28:17,990
Rym: This is one of the best Stanley Cup seasons I've been paying attention to in a long time.

431
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,250
Scott: Burn in hell, Devils, Go Kings!

432
00:28:19,351 --> 00:28:21,169
Rym: So many Game 7, so many overtimes.

433
00:28:21,711 --> 00:28:23,470
Scott: It's Kings and Devils.

434
00:28:23,551 --> 00:28:25,042
Scott: How could you possibly not root for Kings?

435
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,610
Rym: Well, one, gotta root for the underdog.

436
00:28:28,934 --> 00:28:33,710
Rym: Two, Kings... No one's an underdog in the Stanley Cup Finals Scott, when was the last time the Kings won a Stanley Cup?

437
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:37,270
Scott: Did Gretzky win a Stanley Cup on the Kings or did he win them all in Edmonton?

438
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:43,770
Rym: That's what I'm asking you, when was the last time the Kings got a Stanley Cup To the Wikipedia?

439
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:46,250
Rym: When was the last time the Kings were in the Stanley Cup Finals?

440
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,110
Scott: That is also an excellent question.

441
00:28:48,251 --> 00:28:50,410
Scott: Stanley Cups for the Kings, zero.

442
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:57,150
Scott: So even though Wayne Gretzky was there for how many years he won all his cups with Edmonton?

443
00:28:57,413 --> 00:29:03,273
Rym: That is why I'm rooting for the Kings because I remember how crazy Detroit was when we broke our streak in '96, '97.

444
00:29:04,251 --> 00:29:18,389
Rym: The only thing I can say bad about the Kings is that they're in Los Angeles, which is well below the latitude at which hockey should be permitted might burn down Like the city will spontaneously erupt with passion.

445
00:29:18,994 --> 00:29:24,450
Scott: Okay, so conference championships, they were in '92, '93 season, they were in the finals.

446
00:29:25,517 --> 00:29:25,985
Scott: So there you go.

447
00:29:26,795 --> 00:29:29,489
Rym: I'm rooting for them, also I don't want anyone else.

448
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,610
Rym: Devils, pieces of shit.

449
00:29:31,053 --> 00:29:35,929
Rym: Devils knocked the Red Wings out a couple of times in my life So they were already on my shit list, then I moved to New York.

450
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,050
Scott: Devils.

451
00:29:38,419 --> 00:29:38,828
Rym: Good hockey.

452
00:29:39,294 --> 00:29:48,890
Rym: But, you know There's all this talk about football and how football is actually super bad for people, not to get into all that Hockey is also really bad.

453
00:29:48,931 --> 00:29:51,350
Rym: Hockey is pretty bad for people and hockey fights.

454
00:29:52,313 --> 00:29:55,549
Rym: As much as I like hockey fights, I would actually be okay if they got rid of that.

455
00:29:55,751 --> 00:30:03,949
Scott: It's tough, because I like watching a hockey fight but at the same time, I cannot come up with a single argument to defend the continued existence of hockey fights.

456
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,777
Rym: Well, one argument against continuing them is that we have YouTube.

457
00:30:06,918 --> 00:30:13,209
Rym: now I can see pretty much every video recorded hockey fight that ever happens.

458
00:30:14,737 --> 00:30:16,109
Rym: I think that's still the best one ever.

459
00:30:16,735 --> 00:30:25,708
Rym: I've never seen a hockey fight that is better than that, but for anyone who doesn't know, on March 17th 1991, there was a Chicago and St.

460
00:30:25,749 --> 00:30:26,545
Rym: Louis hockey game.

461
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:30,029
Rym: It was before HDTV, obviously, before any of that stuff.

462
00:30:30,937 --> 00:30:36,107
Rym: and I'm going to read a quote from Adam Oates about this fight.

463
00:30:37,097 --> 00:30:47,148
Rym: Quote, "It was weird I was pretty scared, I'll tell you that Let me rephrase that, terrified Grimson Manson, Paluso and they had ten bodies on the ice.

464
00:30:48,488 --> 00:30:57,528
Rym: So this is an almost five minute long video of one of the most famous and spectacular bench clearing hockey brawls of all time.

465
00:30:58,977 --> 00:30:59,930
Rym: It's pretty amazing.

466
00:31:00,031 --> 00:31:03,330
Rym: At one point, it looks like they're going to drag someone from the stands into the fight.

467
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:06,785
Rym: There's so many independent fights that the refs can't do anything about it.

468
00:31:07,151 --> 00:31:09,449
Rym: I just watch it.

469
00:31:09,897 --> 00:31:10,570
Rym: It's amazing.

470
00:31:11,951 --> 00:31:16,495
Scott: I'm sure there are people who remember this particular fight, maybe even as a name or something.

471
00:31:16,596 --> 00:31:16,879
Rym: The St.

472
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,950
Rym: Patrick's Day Massacre.

473
00:31:18,011 --> 00:31:18,798
Scott: There you go, right?

474
00:31:19,121 --> 00:31:26,210
Scott: But it's not nearly all that famous even though it was a gigantic fight, huge guys beating each other up all over the place.

475
00:31:27,035 --> 00:31:31,089
Scott: But yet in basketball fights are extremely rare.

476
00:31:32,355 --> 00:31:37,230
Scott: So rare, in fact, that there's really only one famous basketball fight, which is the Malice at the Palace.

477
00:31:37,754 --> 00:31:44,095
Scott: Now the Malice at the Palace, fight-wise between the players, was really not all that bad as the St.

478
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:56,848
Scott: Patrick's Day Massacre, yet the Malice at the Palace is extremely famous, mostly because at one point, a dude gets hit with a cup of liquid that was thrown from the stands, and then the fighting goes in with the fans.

479
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:08,930
Rym: Think of it this way If there were no walls at a hockey game Imagine Already, that glass is barely keeping the crowd out of the ice.

480
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,668
Scott: That's what I'm saying, there's no glass.

481
00:32:11,293 --> 00:32:12,059
Rym: You know what you'll get?

482
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:13,609
Rym: You'll get what happens at soccer games.

483
00:32:13,952 --> 00:32:16,350
Scott: I know, it would be unbelievable.

484
00:32:16,612 --> 00:32:23,590
Rym: The only difference is, the people in the stands, drunk and full of passion as they are, are not wearing skates and probably have forgotten that ice is slippery.

485
00:32:24,115 --> 00:32:27,109
Rym: So it would be great, but not for the reasons that you'd expect it to be great.

486
00:32:28,073 --> 00:32:31,001
Scott: No, but at the Malice at the basketball, the players went into the stands.

487
00:32:32,614 --> 00:32:37,749
Rym: I remember at RIT, when they were taunting a guy in the box and he actually tried to hit someone in the stands with his stick.

488
00:32:37,991 --> 00:32:41,010
Scott: Yeah, in between the panels of glass Yeah, he got in big trouble.

489
00:32:42,054 --> 00:32:44,103
Rym: This is a pretty good hockey fight Very good.

490
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:53,090
Scott: Oh, thing of the day, right For those of you who don't live in the US, you may not know, we have these two holidays Veterans Day and Memorial Day.

491
00:32:53,837 --> 00:33:05,968
Scott: So Veterans Day is for people who were in the military or war and/or war and are no longer in the military And Memorial Day is for people who are dead because of war.

492
00:33:07,138 --> 00:33:08,770
Scott: There is a distinction between the two holidays.

493
00:33:09,092 --> 00:33:11,348
Scott: Someone asked me, "Why do we have two holidays for

494
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:11,489
Scott: this?".

495
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,490
Scott: I'm like, "Because they're not the same".

496
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:22,867
Scott: It's Memorial, you're in memory of dead people, and veteran, a person who was formerly serving Well, as opposed to President's Day where we took all these other days.

497
00:33:22,907 --> 00:33:24,489
Rym: and we're like, "Alright, you just get one day off".

498
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:31,715
Scott: So, here is a video of, you know, in our So Memorial Day was on Monday, which means you didn't go to work.

499
00:33:32,381 --> 00:33:34,349
Scott: It's bank holiday for UK types.

500
00:33:35,934 --> 00:33:38,870
Scott: So, we have a cemetery in Washington, DC.

501
00:33:38,971 --> 00:33:46,063
Scott: It's actually, I think, just outside of I don't know if it's technically DC, I guess it's Arlington Maryland, or whatever And it's Arlington Cemetery.

502
00:33:47,153 --> 00:33:54,369
Scott: It is the, you know, national military cemetery, and it's just basically most of it is just a sea of small white crosses, as far as you can see.

503
00:33:55,495 --> 00:33:58,048
Scott: And there is a place at the cemetery where I've been.

504
00:33:58,892 --> 00:34:04,708
Scott: that is the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier And it's a dead US soldier in a tomb, and we don't know who it is.

505
00:34:05,193 --> 00:34:14,045
Scott: So it's symbolically, you know it's nobody and everybody at the same time And there's a guard who walks back and forth in front of this you know, thing with a gun.

506
00:34:14,855 --> 00:34:17,507
Rym: Now, it's America, so tourists do what tourists do.

507
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,350
Scott: So, you know, in Britain, there's those guards.

508
00:34:20,411 --> 00:34:21,621
Scott: what are they called at the palace?

509
00:34:21,984 --> 00:34:22,649
Scott: With the funny hats?

510
00:34:22,993 --> 00:34:24,310
Rym: The Royal Palace Guards.

511
00:34:24,431 --> 00:34:25,768
Scott: I don't know what they're actually called, they have a name.

512
00:34:26,652 --> 00:34:31,822
Scott: But, you know, people always make jokes about how you can mess around with them, and they'll never do anything, right?

513
00:34:31,844 --> 00:34:35,016
Scott: They just sort of keep minding their own business and being perfectly still and silent, right?

514
00:34:35,038 --> 00:34:35,909
Rym: The Queen's Guard.

515
00:34:36,812 --> 00:34:46,090
Scott: So, the guard, the singular guard at the, you know Tomb of the Unknown Soldier paces, you know, back and forth, or marches back, whatever the word is Back and forth.

516
00:34:46,473 --> 00:34:50,170
Scott: And then occasionally they have a changing of the guard which is a ceremony, that, you know.

517
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:53,216
Scott: cause you can't, not one person can't do that for that long, right?

518
00:34:53,478 --> 00:34:58,066
Scott: So they have, and you can't just sort of walk off and have another guy walk in and start doing it, it's sort of lame, right?

519
00:34:58,086 --> 00:35:03,850
Scott: You got a little ceremony, and that's what you do when you go to the cemetery, is you watch the ceremony?

520
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:10,110
Scott: Now, the thing is unlike, you know, the guards in Britain.

521
00:35:10,794 --> 00:35:18,474
Scott: if you dick around this guard is actually guarding, and he will yell at you He'll be like, you're not

522
00:35:18,495 --> 00:35:19,121
Rym: allowed to talk

523
00:35:19,363 --> 00:35:31,322
Scott: near the thing you're not allowed to go on the platform where the tomb is, you're not allowed to go over the railing, you're not, you know, you're pretty much, you have to stand during the ceremony, you can't sit unless I guess you're in a wheelchair or something, right?

524
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:38,169
Scott: You know, you have to maintain, I guess he said, an atmosphere of silence and whatever at, you know, at all times.

525
00:35:40,236 --> 00:35:51,550
Scott: So, if you fuck around, the guard yells at you and I don't know what they'll do if you keep fucking around, but since so many tourists go there, there's a lot of yelling This guy does a really good job of telling tourists to stop being dumbasses.

526
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:57,970
Scott: Yes, there's a video montage here of multiple different guards yelling at stupid tourists in many different ways.

527
00:35:58,111 --> 00:35:59,260
Rym: So, why can't...

528
00:35:59,462 --> 00:36:07,989
Scott: I kind of want to go there for like a couple days and just sit there and film any time that he has to yell at someone because I'll probably pick up like ten more that I can add to this montage.

529
00:36:08,252 --> 00:36:14,606
Rym: What I would like to know is, if there's any soldiers who are bored, I would love for you to just patrol around New York City.

530
00:36:17,276 --> 00:36:22,554
Scott: You know, sometimes like I wish you could sign up for the military just to get this sort of job Right?

531
00:36:22,574 --> 00:36:33,429
Scott: It's like I don't want to have to be shot at or kill anyone Right, but I would love to get like the ceremonial job, the thing is the ceremonial job is usually like a great honor that you have to earn by being a real soldier.

532
00:36:34,803 --> 00:36:39,329
Scott: It's not just something that like, okay, we're going to let the guy who sucks so much do the easy job.

533
00:36:39,491 --> 00:36:41,529
Rym: It's like, no, you earn the easy job.

534
00:36:41,691 --> 00:36:48,729
Rym: When we asked, there was the kart racing club, and we were like can we join the club as racers and train to drive the car?

535
00:36:49,113 --> 00:36:50,067
Scott: No, you have to earn that.

536
00:36:51,213 --> 00:36:54,326
Rym: And we were like, yeah, nevermind, I got more important things to do.

537
00:36:54,732 --> 00:37:02,379
Scott: There's other things that I will, you know, because you really only have enough effort in your life to earn one thing or two things that are worth earning, right?

538
00:37:02,743 --> 00:37:10,536
Scott: You know, there's a lot of things you want to earn but you can't buy them, you know, you can't just walk into them, so just pick your battles Right?

539
00:37:10,556 --> 00:37:17,028
Scott: If you try to earn, if you try to do all those great things, you know, drive the F1 car and guard the tomb and you're not going to make it.

540
00:37:17,412 --> 00:37:19,229
Scott: It's not going to happen, no matter how awesome you are.

541
00:37:19,653 --> 00:37:23,130
Rym: So very briefly in the meta moment, ConnectiCon is coming up, check out the website.

542
00:37:23,412 --> 00:37:26,647
Rym: Most of the schedule is up, most of the rest of it will be up in the next day or two.

543
00:37:28,193 --> 00:37:29,329
Rym: We'll be there doing stuff.

544
00:37:29,713 --> 00:37:34,049
Rym: Dave Riley will be there doing stuff Nice karate Good stuff.

545
00:37:35,613 --> 00:37:37,979
Scott: Also in the meta moment, the book called Book is 1Q84.

546
00:37:39,973 --> 00:37:41,146
Rym: I'm going to start calling it Qteen84.

547
00:37:42,313 --> 00:37:43,690
Scott: You can do that because you think it's clever.

548
00:37:43,974 --> 00:37:44,807
Scott: I don't think it's correct.

549
00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:46,050
Scott: though I think it's correct, I think it works.

550
00:37:47,212 --> 00:37:50,309
Rym: I think it's a worthwhile translation, that's how you would say that number.

551
00:37:50,511 --> 00:37:53,188
Rym: And in the context of the book, that's how it's used.

552
00:37:53,208 --> 00:37:58,567
Scott: anyway The actual title of the book is Ichikyu Hachibyon.

553
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,909
Scott: It's the four numbers separately.

554
00:38:01,031 --> 00:38:06,019
Scott: So you shouldn't say 1984, you should say I said 1Q84.

555
00:38:06,971 --> 00:38:10,747
Rym: Yeah, so 1Q84 Yeah, I still think it's going to be Qteen84.

556
00:38:11,978 --> 00:38:13,969
Scott: Anyway That's the book.

557
00:38:14,514 --> 00:38:16,650
Rym: It's a pretty damn good book, I'm mostly done with it.

558
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:18,310
Scott: I already finished it because it was so good.

559
00:38:19,282 --> 00:38:26,184
Scott: But we'll give you some more time before we do an episode because while I don't think it's long, it is It's only three volumes, 900 pages.

560
00:38:26,911 --> 00:38:28,790
Scott: To make up for the fact that I did a bunch of baby books.

561
00:38:28,911 --> 00:38:30,409
Rym: The one thing I will say is that I went into it.

562
00:38:30,773 --> 00:38:34,329
Rym: I literally knew nothing about what it was.

563
00:38:35,232 --> 00:38:37,930
Rym: I didn't even read the back of the book or anything.

564
00:38:37,991 --> 00:38:40,290
Scott: This is the only thing that I knew going into it.

565
00:38:40,553 --> 00:38:43,569
Scott: It was written by Haruki Murakami.

566
00:38:44,094 --> 00:38:51,388
Scott: I know that that is a person who is an extremely famous Japanese author so famous that his books are translated and sold across the world.

567
00:38:51,591 --> 00:39:02,000
Scott: I knew Emily had read another work that was "weird" And that almost every anime person and lots of other people are always citing this guy as an influence.

568
00:39:02,994 --> 00:39:04,630
Scott: He's so important and amazing.

569
00:39:05,556 --> 00:39:07,530
Scott: I should probably know what this guy is all about.

570
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:13,308
Scott: This is his latest, greatest, super popular work that I see everyone reading on the subway and such, let's read it.

571
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:20,804
Rym: What I want to say is that I got halfway through, literally the 50% mark on the Kindle.

572
00:39:21,535 --> 00:39:22,628
Rym: Halfway through the second book.

573
00:39:24,714 --> 00:39:30,848
Rym: I realized suddenly that normal novels it was like building up to the kind of climax that ends most books.

574
00:39:31,713 --> 00:39:33,949
Rym: I realized that that was literally the halfway point.

575
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:41,350
Rym: I'm getting near the end now as I'm starting to see where this is going It's going to be hard not to discuss before the episode.

576
00:39:41,491 --> 00:39:49,478
Scott: Maybe we should record the episode while it's fresh and then put it up later after people have had time because I understand not everyone can read 900 pages in five days.

577
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:57,889
Rym: like I can Not to brag I might have to fly to Toronto next week, Monday and Tuesday.

578
00:39:58,194 --> 00:39:58,988
Scott: You don't want to go there.

579
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,629
Rym: Children have cigarette ads instead of faces.

580
00:40:03,054 --> 00:40:04,188
Scott: Don't bring wicker goods with you.

581
00:40:04,471 --> 00:40:06,909
Rym: Wicker goods are taxed there, I don't want my wicker goods to be taxed.

582
00:40:08,957 --> 00:40:09,987
Scott: Don't look at the donut ads.

583
00:40:11,814 --> 00:40:12,885
Rym: I wonder how many people get that.

584
00:40:13,793 --> 00:40:15,023
Rym: I wonder how much hair that actually is.

585
00:40:17,219 --> 00:40:17,830
Rym: The funny thing is.

586
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:26,870
Rym: I remember at RIT I was looking for that song to get an MP3 of it and I found a different song about Toronto that has the same moral but is very different.

587
00:40:27,598 --> 00:40:35,389
Rym: Anyway I might be out of town those two days meaning you guys should play the Burning Wheel game without me because we missed one already.

588
00:40:35,531 --> 00:40:37,270
Scott: We could also play an alternative game.

589
00:40:37,493 --> 00:40:39,030
Scott: I suggested that last time.

590
00:40:39,252 --> 00:40:49,430
Rym: If you want to play Burning Wheel I'll just figure out some pre-rolls I would want to do and I can roll them with a witness for things I want to do like link tests and all that and then my character is off doing that shit.

591
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:51,025
Scott: You could also practice hours.

592
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,965
Rym: Nah, I want to roll things.

593
00:40:54,755 --> 00:40:55,990
Scott: You don't get things that matter.

594
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:57,569
Scott: if you don't show up, you get practice hours.

595
00:40:58,036 --> 00:40:58,808
Rym: I could lose link tests.

596
00:40:58,828 --> 00:41:01,290
Scott: now I'm not the GM, it's not my call, but that's what I would do if I was GM.

597
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:07,189
Rym: You get practice hours But if I have to go to Toronto next week I pretty much guarantee I'll finish the book on the flight there.

598
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:08,870
Scott: Oh, yeah, you should bring a second book with you.

599
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:09,828
Rym: I also learned something weird.

600
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:12,250
Rym: I've never flown to Toronto.

601
00:41:12,452 --> 00:41:14,270
Rym: I've always lived near enough to just drive to it.

602
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,749
Rym: I guess I could have taken that fast ferry.

603
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:18,070
Scott: Yeah, I guess there's really no reason to fly there.

604
00:41:18,231 --> 00:41:20,194
Scott: I mean, I guess maybe now there is Yeah.

605
00:41:22,257 --> 00:41:33,730
Rym: So I learned that if you fly out of Newark which sucks because now I've got to fly out of Newark You can take this little porter air thing that lands at this tiny little airport in the middle of downtown Toronto Really?

606
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:37,730
Rym: And you take this little ferry right to downtown and there's no security there.

607
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:40,970
Rym: It's like the best little airport and I had no idea this existed.

608
00:41:41,212 --> 00:41:45,710
Scott: and while I have to deal with Newark Well, isn't it going to be like a tiny plane like propellers?

609
00:41:46,191 --> 00:41:51,069
Rym: If it is, whatever, I've got noise isolation earbuds and you know what, I've flown puddle jumpers before.

610
00:41:51,272 --> 00:41:52,870
Scott: You should probably team up with some people.

611
00:41:52,951 --> 00:41:54,310
Scott: get the private jet so it's quieter.

612
00:41:55,294 --> 00:41:57,750
Rym: We're not sending that many people Gulfstream, ten people.

613
00:41:59,132 --> 00:42:00,930
Rym: It'll be maybe two people.

614
00:42:01,071 --> 00:42:02,624
Scott: No, nine people from other companies.

615
00:42:03,432 --> 00:42:04,009
Scott: Team up, charter.

616
00:42:04,675 --> 00:42:06,689
Rym: There is a financial event there.

617
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:10,389
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure there's other financial people who are going that have a seat.

618
00:42:11,222 --> 00:42:11,669
Rym: Yeah, we'll see.

619
00:42:11,852 --> 00:42:13,149
Scott: Anyway, so final meta.

620
00:42:13,574 --> 00:42:15,070
Scott: I upgraded the whole website.

621
00:42:15,412 --> 00:42:17,868
Rym: Oh, I haven't even gone to it since you upgraded it.

622
00:42:18,454 --> 00:42:19,590
Rym: So I upgraded the whole website.

623
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,029
Rym: You can see how busy I've been with Connecticut.

624
00:42:21,674 --> 00:42:23,750
Scott: Oh my god, there's a lot of words.

625
00:42:24,052 --> 00:42:34,549
Scott: Yeah, so I know nobody goes to our website and you can if you want to but it's not necessary because basically the new website is merely, it's mostly just there for Google to see it.

626
00:42:35,413 --> 00:42:38,629
Scott: It's way more words than before And people who like to visit it.

627
00:42:39,013 --> 00:42:40,930
Scott: As soon as you add videos, there'll be a video on the homepage.

628
00:42:41,272 --> 00:42:42,441
Rym: You also gotta add in the old.

629
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,809
Scott: I'm gonna try to get them automatically from the YouTube API.

630
00:42:47,155 --> 00:42:51,407
Scott: And you can also add in the book clubs that are missing.

631
00:42:52,714 --> 00:42:54,190
Rym: I think they're all in the regular website.

632
00:42:54,190 --> 00:43:00,029
Scott: No, when I loaded the database the latest one was I added all my books.

633
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:01,017
Scott: I did add them.

634
00:43:02,793 --> 00:43:03,203
Scott: Look at it.

635
00:43:03,244 --> 00:43:06,070
Rym: later I added them, I typed that shit in.

636
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:07,167
Rym: I remember sitting there and doing it.

637
00:43:07,552 --> 00:43:11,569
Scott: The latest one was I think the, I forget.

638
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:19,430
Scott: Anyway, so the main thing this website does the new version of the website is automatically linking things together.

639
00:43:19,753 --> 00:43:27,848
Scott: It posts things to Facebook automatically and it posts things to Twitter automatically and it posts things to the forum automatically and it's going to.

640
00:43:28,232 --> 00:43:30,530
Scott: We're going to do even more stuff along those lines.

641
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:32,090
Scott: We can't do G+ automatically.

642
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:34,888
Scott: We still have to do it by hand Because Google doesn't have an API.

643
00:43:35,494 --> 00:43:36,688
Scott: It's not because I didn't write it.

644
00:43:38,131 --> 00:43:42,310
Scott: I'm going to add a mail newsletter And I'm going to automatically connect it to YouTube.

645
00:43:42,857 --> 00:43:47,586
Scott: So basically Wherever you are, I might even connect it to a Tumblr and have a Tumblr.

646
00:43:47,626 --> 00:43:48,904
Scott: that is an exact copy, right?

647
00:43:50,371 --> 00:43:53,230
Scott: It's going to be like a dandelion Just spread your seeds all over the fuck.

648
00:43:53,451 --> 00:44:23,310
Scott: So no matter what thing it is you like to use Google Reader, iTunes Whatever you like to use to connect to us, just keep using that thing you like and you can come to our website if you want, but our website is going to publish everything everywhere as much as possible to get our content out to as many people as possible and you're going to see a lot more from us in terms of when there's a YouTube, when you make a YouTube video, it's going to get put out on all those places or when there's a new book club announced.

649
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:24,329
Scott: So go to all those places.

650
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:32,930
Scott: So I'm even thinking of making a GeekNights Reddit and every time we post something on the website a new link is added to the GeekNights Reddit.

651
00:44:33,394 --> 00:44:35,049
Scott: Just go all out like this.

652
00:44:35,554 --> 00:44:41,429
Scott: See how it works, see how much we can spread the community around And if you want to go to the website, you can do that too.

653
00:44:42,038 --> 00:44:42,750
Scott: It's improved.

654
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,109
Scott: I think it's easier to navigate.

655
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:47,128
Scott: It has more information on the front page.

656
00:44:48,290 --> 00:45:02,160
Rym: Don't forget that if you go to our website, every episode back to October 31, 2005 is on the website for download, still, free And I'm going to keep adding more stuff to it at about the rate of a feature per week.

657
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:08,730
Scott: probably I've got a whole list of awesome features that I'm considering, I've already mentioned a few Reddit integration and such.

658
00:45:10,495 --> 00:45:17,250
Scott: Our website doesn't suck anymore as much and you should go to it And expect a lot more stuff to come.

659
00:45:17,654 --> 00:45:29,876
Rym: Maybe we might start doing these live, pre-roll, post-roll of just doing GeekNights More content, more YouTube videos, more Radio Free Equestria more stuff I guess.

660
00:45:29,916 --> 00:45:37,633
Rym: also to all you people who complain about us not consuming media you've asked us to consume or doing things you want us to do, it's because we're doing stuff like this.

661
00:45:37,654 --> 00:45:40,648
Rym: You know how long we've been talking about this stupid website change?

662
00:45:41,191 --> 00:45:45,735
Scott: Speaking of Memorial Day, it took four days to do this shit and I had already done a great deal of it in advance.

663
00:45:46,078 --> 00:45:50,764
Scott: It just took four days to finish it up and there was a lot of stuff that I just sort of bailed on and didn't do.

664
00:45:50,845 --> 00:45:51,958
Scott: that you might not notice.

665
00:45:51,978 --> 00:45:53,854
Scott: I have to go and do Like.

666
00:45:53,996 --> 00:45:57,713
Scott: I disabled all the sitemaps because they stopped working, I had to go reprogram them.

667
00:45:57,854 --> 00:46:03,569
Rym: I'm still editing HD video for, I don't know, two packs worth of stuff I've got videos for.

668
00:46:03,852 --> 00:46:07,956
Scott: I haven't even tested if the episode uploading works, I'm gonna have to sit here while we're in.

669
00:46:07,976 --> 00:46:09,049
Rym: We're gonna find out in a few minutes.

670
00:46:09,252 --> 00:46:11,714
Scott: Yeah, we are Alright.

671
00:46:12,057 --> 00:46:12,279
Rym: Yeah.

672
00:46:12,582 --> 00:46:16,660
Rym: So we've gone on a while so I don't think I'm gonna try to tell the entire tale of my travels.

673
00:46:17,165 --> 00:46:18,440
Rym: This was basically the show about...

674
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:24,275
Scott: Well, that's the thing whenever we don't have an episode for a while It's sort of like when you don't get your groove on for a while.

675
00:46:24,295 --> 00:46:26,930
Scott: It's sort of an explosion of pent up energy.

676
00:46:27,031 --> 00:46:33,470
Rym: We also didn't talk in person for a while because I was in Istanbul and we've been busy in this ConnectiCon.

677
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:35,974
Scott: It's a very busy time here with the ConnectiCon coming up.

678
00:46:36,055 --> 00:47:02,961
Rym: Yep, like believe me, the week before I went to Istanbul, every night it's just like hours and hours and hours of pouring through panel bullshit and typing stuff in and suddenly now that the deadline has come is when all the emails come out of the woodwork from staff who say things like "Oh, by the way, here's six hours of content I need scheduled" and stuff from panelists who were like "Hey, I didn't submit any panels, but I kind of expected you'd give them to me and what panels am I

679
00:47:03,002 --> 00:47:03,224
Rym: doing?".

680
00:47:03,245 --> 00:47:04,196
Scott: Why didn't you submit them?

681
00:47:04,641 --> 00:47:13,449
Rym: You're not getting any Slowly trying to grandfather that stuff out and new website and everything but I had to get all that as much done as possible before I flew to Istanbul.

682
00:47:13,732 --> 00:47:17,730
Rym: so for like two weeks before that trip I was in La La Land doing that work.

683
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:28,459
Scott: I think what we need to do is we need to make a mailing list on MailChimp that has all the people who have ever done ConnectiCon panels who aren't blacklisted and sort of send them out a thing like "Attention!

684
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:31,789
Scott: Panel registration is now open".

685
00:47:32,211 --> 00:47:33,330
Rym: I did that this year.

686
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:34,850
Scott: He does that for PAX.

687
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:40,661
Rym: I did that this year and I think it worked because a lot of the people responded to that.

688
00:47:40,903 --> 00:47:46,529
Scott: And then we could be like "If you do not submit then you will not get a panel no matter what".

689
00:47:47,774 --> 00:47:50,909
Rym: We're getting better every year but this is like crunch time for that.

690
00:47:51,474 --> 00:47:53,109
Rym: And it's summer so I gotta go outside.

691
00:47:55,196 --> 00:47:57,009
Scott: That's the one for one thing keeping me from getting stuff done.

692
00:47:57,996 --> 00:47:58,930
Scott: The sun's out, I'm going biking.

693
00:48:00,074 --> 00:48:02,769
Scott: I've run out of places to bike in Manhattan that I haven't been yet.

694
00:48:02,891 --> 00:48:05,530
Rym: You should go up into the Bronx or something.

695
00:48:05,571 --> 00:48:07,049
Scott: I did that the other day.

696
00:48:07,252 --> 00:48:07,760
Rym: How far up?

697
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:08,309
Rym: Go to Yonkers.

698
00:48:08,794 --> 00:48:10,229
Scott: I didn't go to Yonkers.

699
00:48:10,714 --> 00:48:13,408
Rym: Route 9 is a bike path all the way north.

700
00:48:15,311 --> 00:48:16,388
Scott: That's a little too far.

701
00:48:17,393 --> 00:48:21,270
Scott: The thing is I gotta go far enough so that I can actually get back home on the same day.

702
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:24,429
Rym: You can go far north and take the train back Metro north.

703
00:48:24,551 --> 00:48:26,309
Scott: I don't wanna take the train, I wanna bike the whole time.

704
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:31,549
Rym: Depends Bike to Cafe Maya, eat at Cafe Maya, train home.

705
00:48:32,595 --> 00:48:35,250
Scott: Not too bad I need to buy a train pass at Grand Central before I leave.

706
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:38,865
Scott: It's five bucks and never expires But you can't buy the train pass at Eakins.

707
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:40,128
Rym: No, you know what I did?

708
00:48:40,832 --> 00:48:43,630
Rym: Seven years ago I bought a bike pass and I always keep it in my wallet.

709
00:48:43,772 --> 00:48:45,149
Scott: Next time I'm near Grand Central I'll buy one.

710
00:48:46,359 --> 00:48:49,266
Rym: Actually I don't know where it is right now but it was in my wallet.

711
00:48:49,306 --> 00:48:50,348
Rym: at one point I might have to buy another one.

712
00:48:50,733 --> 00:48:52,529
Scott: So let's talk about Turkey gobble gobble.

713
00:48:53,133 --> 00:48:56,500
Rym: So Istanbul, the first thing I should say is that it is.

714
00:48:58,151 --> 00:49:04,670
Rym: People might have different visions of what a city like Istanbul is like because they imagine other foreign cities and strange places.

715
00:49:04,891 --> 00:49:07,390
Scott: People who haven't traveled have all these imaginations.

716
00:49:07,431 --> 00:49:11,889
Rym: Istanbul is Other than the fact that people are speaking Turkish and there's old stuff around.

717
00:49:12,435 --> 00:49:25,730
Rym: You might as well be in London or New York or DC or Tokyo, it is a completely modern, like subways and taxis and everyone takes credit cards and everything's normal and everything's chill and it's safe.

718
00:49:26,334 --> 00:49:32,049
Rym: It was literally like a completely modern city Except that it didn't smell like piss.

719
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,529
Rym: I was amazed by this.

720
00:49:34,794 --> 00:49:35,649
Rym: The entire city.

721
00:49:36,334 --> 00:49:45,547
Rym: It wasn't like India where people were littering everywhere There was almost no litter anywhere and everything smelled either neutral or of the sea or of flowers.

722
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:53,783
Scott: You've got seas on both sides here The divide of Asia and Europe The Bosphorus river The golden ore and all that stuff.

723
00:49:54,832 --> 00:50:03,322
Scott: The wind can blow in four different directions and no matter which direction it's going, it's probably picking up some sea air Every time I get to PAX, it's like the fresh air.

724
00:50:04,592 --> 00:50:07,281
Rym: This air is going to go through a bunch of America before it gets to me.

725
00:50:07,301 --> 00:50:15,165
Rym: in New York Basically I had one whole day when I flew in just to wander around.

726
00:50:17,356 --> 00:50:18,590
Rym: It was kind of humbling.

727
00:50:18,792 --> 00:50:24,450
Rym: I've visited old places before but I stood on a road that was a thousand years ago.

728
00:50:24,531 --> 00:50:27,590
Rym: that road was already ancient and the origins of it had been mostly forgotten.

729
00:50:28,295 --> 00:50:30,228
Rym: There were just normal houses on that road.

730
00:50:30,248 --> 00:50:38,387
Rym: today It was the same road that a thousand years ago armies marched on, emperors might have ridden on a chariot down In Connecticut.

731
00:50:38,752 --> 00:50:44,150
Scott: the best you could hope for is some revolutionary militia marched down this road or defended here.

732
00:50:44,352 --> 00:50:45,037
Scott: When was that?

733
00:50:45,037 --> 00:50:50,609
Scott: 17 something It's like, yeah, okay See this road?

734
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:53,467
Scott: Alexander the Great was on this road.

735
00:50:53,711 --> 00:50:55,510
Rym: I mean, there were columns.

736
00:50:55,794 --> 00:51:03,447
Rym: There's a bunch of columns around Just like randomly, walking down the street Like a normal street, there's a tramway there and a subway entrance And there's a little fence.

737
00:51:03,791 --> 00:51:11,830
Rym: In the middle of the fence is a giant Roman column that at one point held something up And it's got the original But it's not holding up anything anymore.

738
00:51:12,051 --> 00:51:17,209
Scott: They did a really good job of making columns and a really bad job of making the other parts.

739
00:51:17,472 --> 00:51:21,701
Rym: The other parts got torn down to build normal buildings because the city is still being lived in.

740
00:51:24,197 --> 00:51:26,338
Scott: But if you had a working aqueduct why would you tear it down?

741
00:51:26,419 --> 00:51:29,629
Scott: Even an old Roman aqueduct is still really freaking useful if it works.

742
00:51:30,292 --> 00:51:33,128
Scott: Yeah, to a degree And it's really awesome looking, you shouldn't tear it down.

743
00:51:33,834 --> 00:51:35,490
Rym: But, you know, wars happen.

744
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:40,530
Rym: Turkey, I mean Istanbul, as you may recall was Constantinople.

745
00:51:40,873 --> 00:51:53,730
Rym: Well, you know, King of Kings Look upon my works, you might All you listeners, we've talked about this a lot many years ago, but there's a podcast called 12 Byzantine Rulers And it's pretty much the best podcast you're ever going to listen to.

746
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:55,670
Rym: Forget GeekNights, you should just listen to this thing.

747
00:51:57,295 --> 00:51:58,368
Scott: Why are you listening to us?

748
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:10,047
Scott: I mean, you should not listen to us, as in you should not have this podcast in your iTunes, but you should listen to us as in, if you are listening to this podcast right now, you should do as we tell you That meaning of the word.

749
00:52:10,067 --> 00:52:10,290
Scott: listen.

750
00:52:10,855 --> 00:52:14,650
Rym: But most people in America don't really know about the Eastern Roman Empire.

751
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:17,530
Rym: Like, they know, alright, Rome fell in 476.

752
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:25,430
Rym: Yeah, they're like, there's Greeks and then there's Rome, and in 476 Rome fell and then Dark Ages, and then Renaissance.

753
00:52:26,314 --> 00:52:27,228
Scott: Most people don't even know that.

754
00:52:27,512 --> 00:52:29,028
Scott: I didn't even know that much

755
00:52:31,298 --> 00:52:44,749
Rym: And I remember I have a Western Civ textbook and I think the last time we talked about this, I pulled it out and quoted from it, because it devotes one paragraph saying that the Eastern Roman Empire lasted much longer and was called Byzantium

756
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:45,929
Scott: and actually said something.

757
00:52:47,515 --> 00:52:58,729
Rym: So, people forget that 476, Western Roman Empire fell A thousand years later around that time is when the rest of the Roman Empire fell.

758
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:00,769
Scott: Well, it's sort of one of those situations where it's like.

759
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:06,230
Scott: you know, let's say Virginia was wiped off the map, people would be like, yeah, West Virginia stuck around for a little while, right?

760
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:13,430
Rym: Except in this case, the Eastern Roman Empire was arguably greater in extent and everything than, you know, the Western Roman Empire.

761
00:53:13,632 --> 00:53:15,308
Scott: Well, West Virginians would say the same thing.

762
00:53:15,936 --> 00:53:23,890
Rym: Yeah, but we kind of Except they're wrong To be fair, the West Virginians did side with the Union in the War of Northern Aggression.

763
00:53:24,114 --> 00:53:24,910
Scott: I didn't say they didn't.

764
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:27,029
Scott: It's still a really shitty, meaningless state.

765
00:53:27,352 --> 00:53:33,209
Scott: Perhaps the only more meaningless state is North Dakota, but at least the thing is North Dakota leaves well enough alone.

766
00:53:33,411 --> 00:53:39,430
Scott: Well, the thing about North Dakota is that it's so meaningless that you sort of pay more attention to it, because it's like being in last place.

767
00:53:39,914 --> 00:53:43,490
Scott: West Virginia is sort of like second to last place, so it's like you're completely ignored.

768
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:45,130
Rym: No, North Dakota is not last place.

769
00:53:45,231 --> 00:53:50,277
Rym: They may be irrelevant, but I point out North Carolina, Alabama, Tennessee Georgia...

770
00:53:50,317 --> 00:53:51,370
Scott: No, those are the worst.

771
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:56,748
Scott: I'm talking about the least noticeable, not the place with the worst people.

772
00:53:57,451 --> 00:53:59,926
Scott: Neither one of those is even close to being the place with the worst people.

773
00:54:01,332 --> 00:54:07,089
Scott: It's just the smallest, least thought about by other states, insignificant forgotten state.

774
00:54:07,954 --> 00:54:16,650
Rym: But I mean, the Eastern Roman Empire was basically the progenitor of the Renaissance when the intellectuals fled when the greatest city in the world finally fell.

775
00:54:17,033 --> 00:54:34,249
Rym: I think the quote from Twelve Byzantine Rulers was some French night when the Crusades happened and Constantinople finally fell, at least once and the guy said something to the effect of "I think more houses burned down in this one fire in the middle of this battle than exist in all of France".

776
00:54:36,071 --> 00:54:36,770
Rym: But I digress.

777
00:54:36,992 --> 00:54:38,569
Rym: This is an ancient city.

778
00:54:39,957 --> 00:54:56,730
Rym: A thousand years ago the city was already ancient and already the center of what many people considered to be the civilized world if not the entire world And I saw columns that were ancient a thousand years ago and the coolest part was that some of those were even more ancient.

779
00:54:56,771 --> 00:54:58,289
Rym: There's one called the Serpent Column.

780
00:54:59,235 --> 00:55:00,449
Scott: Has a serpent engraved on it?

781
00:55:00,791 --> 00:55:02,870
Rym: I didn't know about the Serpent Column.

782
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:09,828
Rym: I'm going to pull up Wikipedia to make sure I don't say anything wrong But basically I'm going to pull up Wikipedia to make sure I don't say anything wrong.

783
00:55:11,254 --> 00:55:16,089
Rym: I was standing there and I was looking at it and there was a little plaque that explained that it was from.

784
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:18,109
Rym: Okay, it looks like the plaque is correct.

785
00:55:19,334 --> 00:55:24,310
Scott: Yeah, you can't always trust plaques Like, I was in Jerusalem and there was a plaque Like, this is the tomb of David.

786
00:55:24,452 --> 00:55:25,930
Scott: That is not the tomb of King David.

787
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:33,997
Rym: The Serpent Column was relocated to Constantinople by Constantine the Great in the year 324.

788
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:37,630
Scott: As in the Constantine Not some other guy named Constantine.

789
00:55:37,933 --> 00:55:40,366
Rym: Constantine won The Great.

790
00:55:41,093 --> 00:55:47,809
Scott: He picked up this column somewhere else because he thought it was awesome And he had slaves or who knows who carried it.

791
00:55:48,216 --> 00:55:49,029
Rym: So here's the deal.

792
00:55:49,433 --> 00:56:01,490
Rym: This column in the year 324 was ancient history and was brought as an artifact to be put in the greatest city in the world Sort of like how he brought the pyramid and put it in our museum in the middle of our city.

793
00:56:02,555 --> 00:56:14,509
Rym: Not the pyramid, the Egyptian column I point out next to the serpent column Is a similar Egyptian column to what we have in New York that the Byzantines stole from Egypt.

794
00:56:14,994 --> 00:56:15,418
Rym: You know what?

795
00:56:15,478 --> 00:56:17,327
Rym: Theirs is in much better condition than ours is.

796
00:56:18,911 --> 00:56:24,949
Rym: So, this column was ancient history in the year 324 and they brought it to make a monument about it.

797
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:28,730
Scott: Yeah, so it's the year So we have a cloister here.

798
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:30,538
Scott: It's like a castle FDR, I think, built that.

799
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:47,987
Scott: It's not even 100 years old at best Not even 100 years old This thing, the year 300 The year 2000 So 1700 years And it's already ancient at that point.

800
00:56:48,432 --> 00:56:57,270
Rym: So Scott, 1000 years ago The serpentine column had been in Constantinople since before anyone could remember.

801
00:56:59,763 --> 00:57:04,520
Scott: Oh yeah, so I think we've done enough talking about how old and awesome old things are.

802
00:57:04,701 --> 00:57:14,457
Scott: But I mean, yeah, old things are the awesomest, so we could just call this episode the old things episode and talk about the rest some other time, because we could talk about old things all day.

803
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:15,446
Rym: Scott, the column is 2500 years old.

804
00:57:18,825 --> 00:57:20,138
Scott: Old things are worth talking about.

805
00:57:21,342 --> 00:57:23,060
Scott: We should just do every episode of GeekNights.

806
00:57:24,466 --> 00:57:25,240
Scott: It's no going on GeekNights.

807
00:57:25,301 --> 00:57:26,160
Scott: It's the old things podcast.

808
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:33,859
Scott: Alright, so next episode, Scott Johnson Old man Scott There are other things we could talk about that are pretty old.

809
00:57:34,001 --> 00:57:35,373
Rym: Do you want to talk about Encore Watts?

810
00:57:37,382 --> 00:57:41,138
Scott: Encore Watts is probably not as old as that serpent column, but it's still pretty old.

811
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:42,379
Scott: It's pretty old.

812
00:57:42,541 --> 00:57:43,694
Scott: There's older stuff though.

813
00:57:44,885 --> 00:57:51,739
Rym: You can read about the serpent column and what it's made out of and why it's extra cool, but it was just there Just kind of hanging out.

814
00:57:51,922 --> 00:57:53,179
Scott: It's got to be made out of stone, right?

815
00:57:53,801 --> 00:57:56,120
Rym: But there was a much newer object that really got to me.

816
00:57:56,140 --> 00:58:08,359
Rym: It was a column and it had inscriptions on it from the era of Justinian and earlier and they were kind of faded but visible, and you look at them and they're basically carvings of Romans.

817
00:58:09,046 --> 00:58:10,460
Scott: It's the kind of carving we make today.

818
00:58:10,561 --> 00:58:12,239
Scott: I was going to say it's Latin, I'm like, how can you read it?

819
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:13,438
Rym: So that's the thing.

820
00:58:13,985 --> 00:58:15,320
Rym: This was the Eastern Roman Empire.

821
00:58:16,966 --> 00:58:26,160
Rym: Many things are in Greek But the inscription at the bottom of this column was in Latin and I could read it other than the fact that I don't read Latin.

822
00:58:26,364 --> 00:58:27,080
Scott: That's what I was saying.

823
00:58:27,926 --> 00:58:49,900
Rym: The letters were there, and I kind of had this moment of someone, you know, history is so ancient I can't even fathom it chipped those words there and at that time there were things in this city that were themselves as ancient to that guy as the thing I'm looking at now that he made is to me Otherwise, Istanbul.

824
00:58:50,122 --> 00:59:00,719
Rym: I just wandered around and I kind of I grew a beard before I went on the trip and I dressed in a blazer and nice pants and a dress shirt every day, walking around the city.

825
00:59:01,903 --> 00:59:17,619
Rym: As a result, the sharks that go after tourists left me alone, which was amazing because basically there would be ten people who would descend upon anyone wearing cargo shorts who was obviously a middle-aged American and just try to rip them off.

826
00:59:18,144 --> 00:59:19,557
Rym: They completely ignored me.

827
00:59:21,028 --> 00:59:24,680
Rym: The few people who did try to bother me didn't try English first.

828
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:28,660
Rym: They tried German, Arabic, and French but they never tried English, it was amazing.

829
00:59:29,283 --> 00:59:30,360
Rym: and the few people?

830
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:33,040
Scott: But hey, that guy is that multilingual?

831
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:40,580
Scott: Yes The thing is, you think oh no, he just learned how to give his sales pitch in those languages.

832
00:59:40,923 --> 00:59:48,199
Scott: No, if he hits at you with Arabic, or French, and you start talking to him, he's got to be able to converse.

833
00:59:48,261 --> 00:59:56,680
Scott: Exactly This guy is that multilingual, yet the only thing he can find to do with his life is to pull some scam on the streets.

834
00:59:57,165 --> 00:59:59,459
Scott: Dude, you could be translating comics or something.

835
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:03,159
Rym: Scott, do you know how much money I could make from tourists in Istanbul?

836
01:00:04,502 --> 01:00:07,780
Scott: Is he making more money than he could make as a UN translator?

837
01:00:08,009 --> 01:00:17,900
Rym: Probably The only people who actually tried to rip me off is a few times that they'd be really persistent and they'd try so many languages because they spoke so many languages.

838
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:21,879
Rym: I couldn't get away with trying to use any of the languages I know words in.

839
01:00:22,061 --> 01:00:23,400
Rym: because what if they respond?

840
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:24,077
Rym: Now what?

841
01:00:26,302 --> 01:00:28,220
Rym: I responded to people who were really persistent.

842
01:00:28,422 --> 01:00:29,878
Rym: I said, "Ma'alaman Verhoten".

843
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:33,679
Rym: I figured no one would speak Finnish, and no one did.

844
01:00:34,543 --> 01:00:39,558
Scott: That's a rare one But the thing is the way you say it.

845
01:00:40,084 --> 01:00:42,138
Scott: if the guy is so multilingual he's got to be smart.

846
01:00:42,602 --> 01:00:46,298
Scott: He might be like, "Yeah, that's not your native language, dude I got you".

847
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:47,044
Rym: Maybe not.

848
01:00:48,132 --> 01:00:49,180
Rym: I did it pretty confidently.

849
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:50,459
Scott: Yeah, you could do it confidently.

850
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,159
Rym: I might as well have said, "Baff my dad".

851
01:00:54,647 --> 01:01:00,159
Rym: But they basically completely left me alone, no one tried to rip me off and I think it was just because I didn't dress like an American tourist.

852
01:01:00,484 --> 01:01:03,560
Scott: Yeah, probably It's the same way.

853
01:01:04,145 --> 01:01:07,920
Scott: When I walk around outside my office there's the people trying to sell you comedy show tickets.

854
01:01:08,487 --> 01:01:13,360
Scott: They used to bother me just because there used to be different guys who would do it and they would bother every single person.

855
01:01:13,784 --> 01:01:15,499
Scott: But now it's like, I walk out there.

856
01:01:15,842 --> 01:01:17,233
Scott: I don't have a camera on me.

857
01:01:17,314 --> 01:01:22,528
Rym: most days I'm not, you know No one even ever tries to hand me whatever it is.

858
01:01:22,548 --> 01:01:23,238
Rym: they're trying to hand me.

859
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:26,120
Scott: I'm not walking slowly looking up at the buildings.

860
01:01:26,302 --> 01:01:27,499
Scott: I'm obviously not a tourist.

861
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:29,300
Scott: There's this guy standing there, he's like, "Where are you from, man?

862
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:29,930
Scott: Where are you

863
01:01:29,971 --> 01:01:30,134
Scott: from?".

864
01:01:30,661 --> 01:01:31,789
Scott: "Hey, how you doing there?

865
01:01:31,830 --> 01:01:32,515
Scott: Hey, big guy, what's

866
01:01:32,595 --> 01:01:32,676
Scott: up?".

867
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,697
Rym: "Hey, rap CDs, rap CDs".

868
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:37,580
Scott: Yeah, he doesn't even look at me because I'm not a tourist.

869
01:01:38,045 --> 01:01:39,320
Scott: You can tell by looking at me.

870
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:45,040
Scott: If a tourist walked down the street wearing my clothes at my speed, he also would not be bothered.

871
01:01:45,283 --> 01:01:48,740
Rym: But a lot of people spoke English even, you know, way away from touristy stuff.

872
01:01:48,841 --> 01:01:52,060
Rym: so I could get around just fine on my own and I saw a lot of really cool stuff.

873
01:01:52,684 --> 01:02:09,495
Rym: I'll either talk about another show, get my pictures uploaded or whatever, but I felt safer and more comfortable walking around even very poor and remote neighborhoods in Istanbul in the middle of the night than I do in some places in the Bronx As the Bronx, right The poorest.

874
01:02:10,661 --> 01:02:16,040
Rym: I walked through some of the slummest parts of Istanbul and they were actually a lot nicer than some of the poor parts of New York City.

875
01:02:16,462 --> 01:02:20,119
Rym: They were way nicer than a lot of parts of Baltimore Baltimore?

876
01:02:21,029 --> 01:02:23,959
Scott: Oh, damn Bronx is like a palace compared to Bemore.

877
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,780
Rym: Turkish coffee is a big deal.

878
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:30,740
Rym: They think American coffee habits are ridiculous.

879
01:02:30,801 --> 01:02:37,220
Rym: No kidding They have this perception of us drinking 7-Eleven style big gulps of watery ass decaf coffee.

880
01:02:37,382 --> 01:02:39,619
Rym: Well, a lot of people do And I was like, yeah, that's pretty much what people do.

881
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:44,180
Scott: But most people, I think, now at least get big gulps of Starbucks as opposed to big gulps.

882
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:47,040
Rym: Those might not be legal anymore in New York at those stupid law places.

883
01:02:47,923 --> 01:02:50,260
Scott: I was wondering, is that law going to apply to Starbucks?

884
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:51,779
Rym: It covers coffee.

885
01:02:52,367 --> 01:02:53,138
Scott: It does cover coffee.

886
01:02:53,320 --> 01:03:05,080
Rym: Coffee is sweetened, but it does not cover milkshakes or milk-derived things, nor does it cover espresso-based drinks So some of the beverages at Starbucks can't be vented.

887
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:05,820
Scott: Yeah, so here's the deal.

888
01:03:06,123 --> 01:03:08,120
Rym: Here's the stupidity of this law.

889
01:03:08,704 --> 01:03:18,079
Rym: It bans a 20-ounce soda from a bodega because the bodega also serves food But it does not ban a 4-gallon milkshake.

890
01:03:18,651 --> 01:03:21,160
Scott: Nice Dude, let's open up a restaurant.

891
01:03:21,765 --> 01:03:23,280
Rym: 4-gallon milkshake is all we got.

892
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:24,148
Rym: You know what we should do?

893
01:03:24,431 --> 01:03:31,719
Rym: Let's come up with a cup that is actually two cups, but they're banded together And you sell that to restaurants.

894
01:03:31,801 --> 01:03:34,600
Scott: Well, you got the straw with the split straw.

895
01:03:35,466 --> 01:03:36,297
Rym: No, we don't know.

896
01:03:36,742 --> 01:03:40,700
Scott: We don't even have to sell the cups that are attached to each other.

897
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,975
Scott: We just sell the split straw and that's it.

898
01:03:44,542 --> 01:03:47,520
Rym: No, you gotta sell a thing that makes two cups into one so I can walk around.

899
01:03:47,904 --> 01:03:50,120
Scott: Oh, so it's got a handle with two holes in it?

900
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:53,811
Rym: Kind of like how every hotel that wants to get around are actually very important.

901
01:03:53,891 --> 01:03:54,980
Rym: water conservation laws.

902
01:03:55,528 --> 01:03:57,273
Rym: Two shower heads Daddy.

903
01:03:57,293 --> 01:03:58,480
Scott: two shower heads Exactly.

904
01:03:59,928 --> 01:04:00,773
Rym: Oh, also, you know what?

905
01:04:01,095 --> 01:04:03,820
Rym: You can just drink the water It's fine, you can eat any food.

906
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:05,040
Scott: Well, there's a lot of water there.

907
01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:08,440
Scott: Did you figure out where the water came from?

908
01:04:09,407 --> 01:04:10,200
Scott: Are those fresh water?

909
01:04:10,723 --> 01:04:11,660
Scott: Those are seas, right?

910
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,020
Rym: There's also fresh water.

911
01:04:13,123 --> 01:04:13,619
Scott: Are they fresh?

912
01:04:13,943 --> 01:04:16,519
Rym: No, there's the sea and there's the Bosphorus and there's other lakes.

913
01:04:16,661 --> 01:04:18,400
Scott: Yeah, it's the Bosphorus, what is it?

914
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:21,200
Rym: It's got the tap water, tasted as good as New York tap water.

915
01:04:21,361 --> 01:04:23,539
Scott: I'm sure it did, but I'm wondering where it came from.

916
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:26,859
Rym: How many New Yorkers know where our water comes from?

917
01:04:27,121 --> 01:04:28,179
Scott: I know exactly where it comes from.

918
01:04:28,626 --> 01:04:29,639
Rym: How many New Yorkers know?

919
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:31,639
Scott: Probably not that many think about it.

920
01:04:31,861 --> 01:04:34,820
Scott: So, the restaurants I ate at There's an aqueduct from the Catskills.

921
01:04:34,921 --> 01:04:37,117
Scott: It's actually the longest underground tunnel.

922
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:40,840
Scott: The seafood was so good Because they catch it right there.

923
01:04:41,644 --> 01:04:44,878
Rym: There's a million people fishing on the river, connecting.

924
01:04:45,202 --> 01:04:47,000
Scott: That's probably a way to make a fuck ton of money.

925
01:04:47,424 --> 01:04:50,540
Rym: So I had fish that they brought them to the restaurant.

926
01:04:50,641 --> 01:04:55,059
Rym: They were still wet when they dumped them out And I ate those fish.

927
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:56,739
Rym: They were like these little river fish.

928
01:04:57,668 --> 01:04:58,339
Scott: Oh, little fish?

929
01:04:59,481 --> 01:05:04,920
Scott: So it was like head comes off tail comes out, here's the fish Knife goes in, guts come out.

930
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:10,598
Rym: To quote a friend that I have now in Turkey Americans are afraid of heads and eyes on anything they eat.

931
01:05:11,002 --> 01:05:12,980
Scott: I'm not afraid of the head, I've been on it still.

932
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:13,960
Scott: I'm just not gonna eat that part.

933
01:05:14,021 --> 01:05:15,880
Rym: Yeah, so he was like, are you afraid of heads?

934
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:19,060
Rym: I was like, fuck no They realized early on that I'm not a typical American.

935
01:05:19,362 --> 01:05:25,937
Rym: So they regaled me with their perceptions of Americans And my job was to say yes, they're like that Or no, they're actually not like that.

936
01:05:27,827 --> 01:05:28,779
Scott: That is a good thing to do.

937
01:05:29,424 --> 01:05:33,920
Scott: A few people in the world will be more understanding of other countries in both directions.

938
01:05:33,961 --> 01:05:37,320
Rym: At one point they were like So really, the imperial system.

939
01:05:38,449 --> 01:05:39,818
Rym: And I was like Alright, so here's the deal.

940
01:05:40,383 --> 01:05:44,260
Rym: Americans actually only use like three or four kinds of units for anything, and they don't use.

941
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:46,540
Rym: It's not that they don't use the metric system.

942
01:05:47,066 --> 01:05:48,340
Rym: They don't use the imperial system either.

943
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:50,900
Rym: They just don't talk about volume, ever.

944
01:05:51,506 --> 01:05:58,540
Rym: And if they do, it's gallons Like, Americans don't need a unit of mass Because they never use mass for anything.

945
01:05:58,621 --> 01:05:59,752
Scott: Except how much do you weigh?

946
01:05:59,913 --> 01:06:00,580
Scott: That's the only thing.

947
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:01,840
Rym: That's weight and not mass.

948
01:06:01,921 --> 01:06:03,880
Rym: So they use pounds, because that's a unit of weight.

949
01:06:04,365 --> 01:06:07,320
Rym: But they don't use slugs The mass unit.

950
01:06:08,304 --> 01:06:09,860
Rym: But it's not that they use metric.

951
01:06:10,001 --> 01:06:11,840
Rym: They just don't use a unit for mass.

952
01:06:12,324 --> 01:06:14,740
Rym: And if they're a scientist, they use the metric system Because they're not stupid.

953
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:22,399
Rym: So once I explain that And how we also think the system is stupid And most of us don't even use it Or know how it works.

954
01:06:22,863 --> 01:06:24,959
Rym: They were very surprised by that, and it kind of made sense.

955
01:06:25,725 --> 01:06:35,659
Scott: See, the thing is, we have this sort of When anyone goes to another country Even, I assume, really ignorant people There is sort of a cultural exchange That happens no matter what, even if it's a very small one.

956
01:06:36,726 --> 01:06:43,680
Scott: But the thing is We're coming to this world Where, you know, there's still a great deal Of international cultural boundaries.

957
01:06:43,842 --> 01:06:48,918
Scott: But we're having cultural boundaries Even within countries The nerds versus the whoever's.

958
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:58,980
Rym: We've said this before, a nerd in Istanbul Has more in common with you and me And some nerd in Tokyo Than we do with people who live 20 miles north of New York City.

959
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:03,400
Scott: We need more cultural exchange between The non-country cultures.

960
01:07:03,723 --> 01:07:15,139
Scott: The nerd culture is Really willing to share And teach other people about nerd culture But no one's really interested in hearing And no one really feels the need to share Their culture with nerds either.

961
01:07:15,846 --> 01:07:28,020
Scott: We need more exchanges Of this nature in the other Areas That are not simply country borders Alright, so hey Are you a homophobic guy In a really rural part of the country?

962
01:07:28,061 --> 01:07:32,180
Scott: Listen to GeekNights and learn something We want to learn about you and your guns.

963
01:07:33,261 --> 01:07:36,100
Scott: Some of that stuff's pretty cool Blowing stuff up in the backyard.

964
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:36,880
Scott: We're on board.

965
01:07:37,062 --> 01:07:40,619
Rym: I feel like telling them what we really think wouldn't matter If we went to them, we're like, you know what?

966
01:07:41,201 --> 01:07:42,292
Rym: We really don't care.

967
01:07:42,333 --> 01:07:44,660
Rym: if you have guns We literally go nuts.

968
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:45,820
Rym: We don't care.

969
01:07:46,843 --> 01:07:50,780
Rym: But you have to not hate gay people In your laws, that's all we want.

970
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:56,240
Scott: For a small amount of time, you hang out With guys like that, I feel like we could get along On some common grounds.

971
01:07:56,771 --> 01:08:02,820
Scott: Even the most hickest racist guy Go in the backyard Set food on fire, set things on fire.

972
01:08:03,143 --> 01:08:07,220
Rym: Very few people can resist the allure Of blowing something up in the middle of the woods.

973
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:08,020
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

974
01:08:09,153 --> 01:08:16,314
Scott: Anyone can get along with anyone Even if I went to Turkey and it happened to be Crazy, fundamentalist guys I was working with.

975
01:08:17,227 --> 01:08:20,520
Scott: Actually what was funny is We could get along for a short time if I wasn't Jewish.

976
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:27,198
Rym: By and large, the people I talked to in Istanbul Really Really are sick of the religious people Fucking everything up.

977
01:08:27,622 --> 01:08:29,960
Scott: I think that's because it's the same situation we have here.

978
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,379
Scott: We're in the city, out of the city.

979
01:08:31,479 --> 01:08:42,354
Rym: What was funny is a lot of them would complain about Muslims The way atheists in America complain About Christians Just because Muslims are the guy next door Beating a drum in the middle of the night because it's Ramadan Or whatever.

980
01:08:44,161 --> 01:08:50,339
Scott: At least no religious practice At least not many in the US that are common Involve bothering neighbors.

981
01:08:50,602 --> 01:08:52,380
Rym: Well, church bells, but at least they're kind of pleasant.

982
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:53,260
Scott: Church bells are nice, I like church bells.

983
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:57,560
Rym: One guy I was talking to at a restaurant was like "Oh my god, the call to prayer just shut up, it's so loud".

984
01:08:57,621 --> 01:09:04,760
Rym: And I gotta tell ya The call to prayer Is really goddamn annoying But not for any religious reason.

985
01:09:04,921 --> 01:09:05,920
Scott: Doesn't it sound good?

986
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:11,513
Rym: It would if it wasn't primarily Blasted through the worst possible speaker PA system?

987
01:09:12,728 --> 01:09:13,760
Scott: Like the horn shape thing?

988
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:18,595
Rym: It sounds like they got A RadioShack speaker and put a megaphone In front of it.

989
01:09:19,486 --> 01:09:20,554
Rym: It would be beautiful.

990
01:09:21,667 --> 01:09:23,129
Scott: But for that You know what you could do?

991
01:09:23,149 --> 01:09:26,319
Scott: You could actually start a thing Where the Muslim people would probably donate to it.

992
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:36,060
Scott: Oh my god, just go around the world and replace Those speakers with nice speakers And you just upgrade their sound system And you could partner with an audio Scott, I think you're a genius.

993
01:09:36,982 --> 01:09:40,004
Scott: You partner with a speaker company Right?

994
01:09:40,841 --> 01:09:45,148
Scott: And you find a Chinese factory And mass produce a perfect Speaker.

995
01:09:45,189 --> 01:09:55,418
Rym: just for that I think making speakers for mosques To do the call to prayer that were good Would do more for Muslim Non-Muslim relations than anything else In the world we could ever do.

996
01:09:55,725 --> 01:09:59,080
Scott: It would be great And the religious people would pay for it partially.

997
01:09:59,324 --> 01:10:09,119
Scott: They would be happy to donate Cause the way we'd sell it to them Is in addition to upgrading We would also add new ones so it would reach further To places where you maybe couldn't hear it.

998
01:10:09,485 --> 01:10:10,260
Scott: You know, like bathrooms.

999
01:10:11,483 --> 01:10:12,696
Scott: It's a way to sell more speakers too.

1000
01:10:13,181 --> 01:10:14,340
Rym: But anyway Istanbul was awesome.

1001
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,959
Rym: And to cut the show short, I'll talk about it more later.

1002
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:22,180
Rym: Germany, the only thing they'll say is They served beer by the leader.

1003
01:10:22,281 --> 01:10:23,660
Rym: It just kept coming.

1004
01:10:24,288 --> 01:10:25,059
Scott: Do you get any wieners?

1005
01:10:25,842 --> 01:10:29,931
Rym: If they bring you bread or pretzels on a table They check how many you ate And charge you for them.

1006
01:10:29,951 --> 01:10:32,640
Scott: at the end It's bullshit, but there's no tipping though, right?

1007
01:10:33,441 --> 01:10:34,960
Rym: People didn't seem to care about tipping.

1008
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:36,560
Rym: I asked a taxi driver, how much did I tip?

1009
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:39,140
Rym: He was like, you're over 2, it doesn't really matter, no one cares.

1010
01:10:39,787 --> 01:10:45,540
Rym: And he actually didn't want a tip Because he was Turkish A Turkish taxi driver in Germany?

1011
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:48,899
Rym: So in Munich There's so many Turkish people.

1012
01:10:49,426 --> 01:10:52,638
Scott: Oh, interesting They took the same flight you did.

1013
01:10:53,264 --> 01:10:57,739
Rym: Well he's a taxi driver, he's lived there forever And he's like, I'm going to Istanbul next week To see some family.

1014
01:10:58,585 --> 01:11:02,280
Rym: So we talked about Istanbul And he actually complained about a lot of the same things.

1015
01:11:02,587 --> 01:11:03,080
Rym: It was funny.

1016
01:11:05,424 --> 01:11:06,396
Scott: That's how you know, right?

1017
01:11:07,203 --> 01:11:20,799
Scott: If a taxi driver in Munich Complains about the same things in Istanbul As a guy in Istanbul complained about That's a valid complaint Because these two unconnected people Were going on the same thing Or they were both the same guy with the disguise of the CIA.

1018
01:11:21,323 --> 01:11:22,977
Rym: So I have three final anecdotes.

1019
01:11:22,997 --> 01:11:28,639
Rym: we'll end One, in Germany I overheard more people Speaking English than I do on the streets of New York.

1020
01:11:28,845 --> 01:11:29,218
Scott: That's good.

1021
01:11:29,684 --> 01:11:32,259
Rym: And everyone I met who spoke English Their English was.

1022
01:11:33,145 --> 01:11:34,259
Scott: They wouldn't know every word.

1023
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,760
Scott: Did they have German accents though, right?

1024
01:11:36,345 --> 01:11:38,020
Rym: No, that was what was interesting.

1025
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:43,347
Rym: When they spoke English, it was perfect And had the exact Midwestern Neutral accent.

1026
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,259
Scott: They weren't like Erde Koster.

1027
01:11:46,205 --> 01:11:54,020
Rym: It sounded perfectly natural And the only way you would know They were a non-native speaker Is when they struggled for a word they didn't know.

1028
01:11:54,101 --> 01:11:58,640
Rym: But if they knew a word, they spoke it In a very neutral accent.

1029
01:11:58,721 --> 01:11:59,820
Rym: That was kind of surprising.

1030
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,479
Scott: Did you help people out with the words they didn't know?

1031
01:12:01,801 --> 01:12:05,219
Scott: Yeah, and two Because you could usually tell what word someone's going for.

1032
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:13,556
Rym: The majority of young people I overheard Speaking in English And every young person was speaking in English Was talking about video games Because they were internetting.

1033
01:12:13,597 --> 01:12:22,980
Rym: probably They were talking about Modern Warfare 2 CoD, Call of Duty Games like that And I talked to some of them a little bit.

1034
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:28,918
Scott: I played video games Land parties over there PC game world.

1035
01:12:29,121 --> 01:12:33,497
Rym: I was talking to one of my partners there In English about gaming stuff.

1036
01:12:34,021 --> 01:12:36,280
Scott: Emily, he's got partners in other countries.

1037
01:12:36,384 --> 01:12:36,778
Scott: Watch out.

1038
01:12:37,143 --> 01:12:43,480
Rym: And basically this little kid I overhear him in the next row He's like, that foreign guy's talking about video games.

1039
01:12:43,541 --> 01:12:46,657
Rym: Oh my god What name is he talking about?

1040
01:12:46,677 --> 01:12:47,677
Rym: I don't know Some board game.

1041
01:12:48,925 --> 01:12:50,020
Rym: Kid didn't know any of the board games.

1042
01:12:50,061 --> 01:12:51,580
Scott: Did you bring Spot It and Jungle Speed?

1043
01:12:51,961 --> 01:12:54,571
Rym: I didn't have any time to play games with anyone At all.

1044
01:12:57,744 --> 01:13:00,560
Scott: We didn't continue our pattern of board game cultural exchange.

1045
01:13:00,681 --> 01:13:01,452
Rym: So that was anecdote one.

1046
01:13:02,121 --> 01:13:03,739
Rym: Everyone in Germany speaks English just fine.

1047
01:13:04,882 --> 01:13:09,840
Rym: Anecdote number two in Munich Is that I went to many sorts of gardens and things.

1048
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:11,049
Rym: They have a park like Central Park.

1049
01:13:11,090 --> 01:13:13,120
Rym: that's way bigger than Central Park In the middle of the city.

1050
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:20,599
Rym: Not hard to be bigger than Central Park But entirely within a major city It's one of the few that's bigger than Central Park actually.

1051
01:13:21,553 --> 01:13:28,700
Rym: But The gardens In Germany Have a symmetry that is Almost disturbing.

1052
01:13:29,842 --> 01:13:37,114
Rym: I was walking down the middle of this big Garden And I realized it was so symmetrical That I felt like I was in a Counter Strike 1-6 map.

1053
01:13:38,266 --> 01:13:39,016
Scott: Who made this garden?

1054
01:13:39,036 --> 01:13:39,320
Rym: How old was it?

1055
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:40,295
Rym: Germans, I don't know.

1056
01:13:41,503 --> 01:13:42,860
Scott: It's not Constantine old.

1057
01:13:43,042 --> 01:13:44,478
Rym: Is it Holy Roman Empire old?

1058
01:13:45,268 --> 01:13:51,600
Rym: All I can say is that Any garden I entered Had a frightful symmetry and a frightful Artificiality.

1059
01:13:51,722 --> 01:13:52,819
Rym: It didn't have streams.

1060
01:13:53,464 --> 01:13:58,919
Rym: It had perfectly straight Manicured canals with straight bridges over them.

1061
01:13:59,081 --> 01:14:00,139
Scott: You sure it wasn't just that one?

1062
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:02,200
Rym: I went to several in Munich and they were all like that.

1063
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:02,872
Scott: Maybe it's Munich.

1064
01:14:03,683 --> 01:14:05,620
Scott: Maybe there was some king near Munich.

1065
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:08,798
Rym: As Luke Burish said, no that's not Germany That's Europe, but we'll see.

1066
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:13,210
Scott: Maybe in the 800's some king near Munich Had this garden made.

1067
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:21,318
Rym: So the third and final anecdote With one exception, every cab I took And the entire time I was in Istanbul Tried to rip me off.

1068
01:14:22,141 --> 01:14:26,579
Rym: Now I knew, I read online That there is a specific con they will do.

1069
01:14:26,823 --> 01:14:27,720
Rym: Now there's some basic ones.

1070
01:14:28,083 --> 01:14:29,960
Rym: They'll run the night rate instead of the day rate.

1071
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:33,357
Rym: So I learned those Turkish words for day and night And I'd be like, no no no!

1072
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:36,638
Rym: Change it to day, I know exactly what you're trying to do You ass.

1073
01:14:37,643 --> 01:14:40,840
Rym: And they'd always be like, oh sorry They tried to pretend.

1074
01:14:41,825 --> 01:14:46,257
Scott: Just be like, dude Don't have to pretend that you weren't Trying to rip me off.

1075
01:14:46,885 --> 01:14:48,300
Rym: You're getting ahead of my anecdote.

1076
01:14:50,287 --> 01:14:59,621
Rym: So the most common one Is they will Take your money And you'll have like a 50 lira note Which is like $26.

1077
01:14:59,621 --> 01:15:01,037
Scott: Oh it's like 50 cents for a lira?

1078
01:15:01,921 --> 01:15:03,386
Rym: A lira is like about half a dollar Like 1.8 something.

1079
01:15:05,063 --> 01:15:08,677
Rym: So they'll take your 50 lira note And they'll do really good sleight of

1080
01:15:08,717 --> 01:15:08,979
Scott: hand

1081
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:14,140
Rym: And show you like, no you gave me a 5 Because tourists are like, oh sorry They don't want to make a confrontation

1082
01:15:14,802 --> 01:15:14,943
Scott: And

1083
01:15:15,023 --> 01:15:17,240
Rym: this is such a common thing that I was ready for it.

1084
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:24,120
Rym: You took a picture of the bill and then So I did that once But basically I held it out to him And he goes to take it and I didn't let go.

1085
01:15:24,221 --> 01:15:30,599
Rym: And I took my phone up and I took a picture and I made it make the click And I looked at him and he sighed And then he gave me my right change.

1086
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:31,537
Rym: There you go.

1087
01:15:31,941 --> 01:15:35,060
Rym: Another guy did it and I didn't take a picture because I was tired.

1088
01:15:35,424 --> 01:15:40,440
Rym: And I looked at him and I was like Dude, don't bullshit me I know exactly what you're doing.

1089
01:15:40,481 --> 01:15:41,400
Rym: You do this to everyone.

1090
01:15:42,105 --> 01:15:42,838
Rym: I'll call the police.

1091
01:15:43,444 --> 01:15:45,699
Rym: And he pretended he didn't understand a little bit.

1092
01:15:46,203 --> 01:15:48,040
Rym: And I was like, dude I know you understand me.

1093
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:49,636
Rym: It's obvious you understand every word.

1094
01:15:49,676 --> 01:15:53,000
Rym: I'm saying Just give me my change and I'll give you a tip anyway.

1095
01:15:53,546 --> 01:15:55,538
Rym: And he was like, uh It usually works.

1096
01:15:56,044 --> 01:15:57,880
Rym: He said that in English and he gave me the tip.

1097
01:15:58,205 --> 01:16:01,540
Rym: I reported him anyway But I did give him a 5 lira tip.

1098
01:16:02,506 --> 01:16:05,729
Scott: If I got in a cab and I knew that everyone was scamming I'd be like One cabbie.

1099
01:16:05,911 --> 01:16:10,680
Rym: when I sat down I looked at him and I was like I'm not a tourist.

1100
01:16:11,085 --> 01:16:12,139
Rym: Don't try to rip me off.

1101
01:16:12,564 --> 01:16:14,119
Rym: I'm going to the Sheraton in Maslach.

1102
01:16:14,701 --> 01:16:16,236
Rym: Don't pretend you don't know where that is.

1103
01:16:17,188 --> 01:16:17,797
Rym: And he looked at me.

1104
01:16:18,222 --> 01:16:19,859
Rym: Then he sighed and then he drove me to the hotel.

1105
01:16:20,961 --> 01:16:22,459
Rym: One cabbie was this punk kid.

1106
01:16:22,621 --> 01:16:23,631
Rym: He must have been like late 20s.

1107
01:16:25,005 --> 01:16:30,300
Rym: I get in the cab and I tell him Sheraton Maslach, that's just where I was staying But there was a subway station right in front.

1108
01:16:30,562 --> 01:16:34,419
Rym: It was like the equivalent of staying in Queens Like Astoria, next to Manhattan.

1109
01:16:35,203 --> 01:16:36,460
Rym: So I told him, Sheraton Maslach.

1110
01:16:36,541 --> 01:16:41,480
Rym: And he was like, Maslach I know He didn't speak English that well, it was obvious Sheraton, I'm not so sure.

1111
01:16:41,621 --> 01:16:43,418
Rym: So I was like, alright, I'll tell you how to get there.

1112
01:16:44,403 --> 01:16:49,140
Rym: And he was actually, he really didn't know He was super earnest Or he was the best actor in the universe.

1113
01:16:49,281 --> 01:16:53,080
Rym: He didn't try to rip me off He didn't mess with the meter.

1114
01:16:53,201 --> 01:16:58,239
Rym: He was the only cabbie who did not try to rip me off And was earnest the whole time.

1115
01:16:58,845 --> 01:17:00,037
Rym: And you know, company dime.

1116
01:17:00,098 --> 01:17:06,840
Rym: anyway I gave him like a $30 tip Because with the $30 tip Would have been cheaper than the guys who tried to rip me off.

1117
01:17:07,963 --> 01:17:09,520
Rym: And he was like, are you sure?

1118
01:17:09,740 --> 01:17:10,780
Rym: When I gave him the extra money?

1119
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:12,480
Rym: Like are you sure you don't want change?

1120
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:16,820
Scott: I was like, yeah I know I'm trying to teach you that you're doing it the right way.

1121
01:17:16,961 --> 01:17:19,640
Scott: Every other cabbie in the whole city tries to rip everyone off.

1122
01:17:19,964 --> 01:17:21,260
Scott: You did not try to rip me off.

1123
01:17:21,483 --> 01:17:22,660
Rym: This is your reward.

1124
01:17:22,963 --> 01:17:28,378
Rym: I explained to him, I was like, look, you're the first person I've gotten into a cab with the entire time I've been here Who did not try to scam me?

1125
01:17:29,481 --> 01:17:34,619
Rym: Thank you And I think he understood it at that point And he had a huge smile on his face when I got out of the cab.

1126
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:36,660
Rym: Kind of like when I was in India, but that was different.

1127
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:39,280
Rym: That was when I gave the guy, I gave a tip to one cabbie.

1128
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:44,900
Rym: At the end that would be the equivalent here Of giving a guy like a couple hundred bucks But that was a whole different situation.

1129
01:17:45,042 --> 01:17:46,660
Scott: But there's a different exchange rate involved there.

1130
01:17:47,305 --> 01:17:52,130
Scott: Like if I went to Thailand, I could be like I had currency shock Because I was in Istanbul.

1131
01:17:53,184 --> 01:17:56,715
Rym: Then I get to Europe and I'm like Oh shit, euros, my stupid weak ass.

1132
01:17:56,816 --> 01:17:58,157
Scott: American dollar God damn it.

1133
01:17:58,341 --> 01:18:02,340
Scott: The problem is if you do that too much You get in big trouble the other way Because you draw this attention.

1134
01:18:02,441 --> 01:18:08,879
Scott: Imagine if someone walked down the street just throwing Benjamins around Whoa, shit son You'll be mobbing him.

1135
01:18:09,161 --> 01:18:11,439
Scott: So you can't do that when you go to places that have cheap money.

1136
01:18:12,711 --> 01:18:13,700
Rym: But it was super fun.

1137
01:18:13,821 --> 01:18:16,179
Rym: And now I might have to go to Toronto soon.

1138
01:18:16,341 --> 01:18:17,994
Scott: I don't want to go to Toronto.

1139
01:18:18,942 --> 01:18:20,399
Scott: How's the Canadian dollar doing?

1140
01:18:22,602 --> 01:18:24,659
Scott: Isn't it slightly stronger than the US dollar?

1141
01:18:25,181 --> 01:18:31,220
Scott: US dollar is not looking so good right now Not to look so good Better than the, well The Greeks are lucky they don't have a Greek.

1142
01:18:35,643 --> 01:18:37,560
Scott: Yeah, was there any Greek spillover going on there?

1143
01:18:38,821 --> 01:18:42,298
Rym: Most of the Greeks were expelled from Turkey Not that long ago.

1144
01:18:43,006 --> 01:18:44,853
Scott: But I mean like obviously But I mean like.

1145
01:18:44,914 --> 01:18:46,157
Scott: you know It's right there.

1146
01:18:46,562 --> 01:18:50,077
