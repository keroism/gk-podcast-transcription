00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,210
Rym: It's Tuesday, August 21st, 2012.

2
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,092
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,373 --> 00:00:15,580
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,921 --> 00:00:20,477
Rym: Counter-Strike go go go go Start going around back.

5
00:00:23,597 --> 00:00:24,648
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:28,037 --> 00:00:31,706
Rym: you know suddenly my life got really exciting like just in the last few weeks.

7
00:00:31,826 --> 00:00:36,166
Rym: packs became a few weeks away and Counter-Strike go I can play it.

8
00:00:36,768 --> 00:00:40,380
Rym: Yeah, and I haven't done much else except wait for packs and play counter-strike.

9
00:00:40,622 --> 00:00:42,374
Scott: So I got this awesome gaming opening.

10
00:00:42,394 --> 00:00:43,039
Scott: be ready for this.

11
00:00:44,202 --> 00:00:54,234
Scott: On Sunday, I met up with some people in the Prospect Park And we played this game that I got once as part of a kickstarter Called Johan Sebastian joust.

12
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:54,980
Scott: have you heard of this game?

13
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,304
Scott: I have not.

14
00:00:56,324 --> 00:00:57,589
Scott: it was sort of this indie thing.

15
00:00:57,609 --> 00:00:57,931
Scott: people wait.

16
00:00:57,951 --> 00:01:02,011
Rym: that explains because I was in Prospect Park on Sunday and I was.

17
00:01:02,031 --> 00:01:12,449
Rym: I was on my way home and I pulled up Google Maps to find a better route because I wanted to take fillin Chieh up Bedford Avenue to show them the gradient of Conservative Jews to less conservative to hipster to full hipster

18
00:01:12,589 --> 00:01:12,830
Scott: yep,

19
00:01:13,512 --> 00:01:17,804
Rym: and I was like oh Scott's like right there I wasn't.

20
00:01:17,884 --> 00:01:21,869
Scott: I was like why is he down here anyway, so It's not a game.

21
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:27,519
Scott: It's one of those games that's hard to play because you need people and you need the equipment and you need stuff, but these people had it.

22
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:33,835
Scott: so I went down there and Basically what they did is they ran the software on the Macbook and they had a bluetooth speaker.

23
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:41,620
Scott: actually they plugged a wire into Eventually because the save a Bluetooth channel, and they used ps1 motion plus and that motion plus.

24
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,243
Scott: What are they called?

25
00:01:42,343 --> 00:01:43,428
Rym: move the lollipops?

26
00:01:43,488 --> 00:01:44,232
Scott: Yeah the lollipops?

27
00:01:44,252 --> 00:01:45,960
Scott: Did you know that the ball in the end of those is squishy?

28
00:01:46,761 --> 00:01:49,020
Scott: Yes, I've never used one so I didn't know that anyway.

29
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,531
Scott: so the way the game works is pretty simple.

30
00:01:50,571 --> 00:01:57,214
Scott: everyone grabs a lollipop and you push any button on it to connect to the blue computer and the computer runs it not the.

31
00:01:57,495 --> 00:02:02,349
Scott: you know PlayStation right and Everyone joins and everyone gets a color.

32
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:22,059
Scott: or you can do team mode, but we did every man for himself And you get a color so you push it and it goes green and it makes a lightsaber noise like But all the noise comes out of the central speaker anyway, then it'll go ready Go and that the game begins and music starts playing and the music is Bach.

33
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:33,760
Scott: now You can't just load in any music which is disappointing because the data file that goes with the music and the data file sort of You know no tells the game which when the music is getting fast and when the music is getting slow.

34
00:02:34,283 --> 00:02:37,080
Scott: So when the music is slow you have to go slow and the music is fast.

35
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:48,820
Scott: You can go fast and the all there is in the game is this it's last person alive wins If your lollipop PlayStation thing or or you can use remotes, but you won't have the handy light on top.

36
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,268
Scott: It's better with the PlayStation ones.

37
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:58,420
Scott: if it is disturbed too much It will explode and turn red and then go out completely and you'll be dead which means you're out.

38
00:02:58,601 --> 00:03:05,173
Rym: So I'm trying to without disturbing mine disturb yours Exactly now at the same time and I kick you in the shin and grab it.

39
00:03:05,354 --> 00:03:06,418
Scott: Uh, listen, I'm gonna get to that.

40
00:03:07,641 --> 00:03:09,590
Rym: So that seems like the basic strategy.

41
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:14,934
Scott: if it's disturbed a little bit It'll start to blink and warn you and vibrate a little bit.

42
00:03:14,954 --> 00:03:16,440
Scott: that you are, you know on the edge.

43
00:03:16,852 --> 00:03:20,108
Scott: Okay So, of course I'm like, how do I win this game?

44
00:03:20,268 --> 00:03:22,880
Scott: and everyone else is just sort of playing casual for fun?

45
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,129
Scott: And I'm like none and I played a win.

46
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,540
Rym: Did you kick everybody in the shins?

47
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,766
Scott: Well, okay, so I try it.

48
00:03:26,786 --> 00:03:28,336
Scott: first of all, I you know, I was.

49
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,567
Scott: I asked them I'm like, can I just fucking kick you?

50
00:03:30,687 --> 00:03:31,189
Scott: Can I?

51
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:31,972
Scott: what can I do?

52
00:03:32,575 --> 00:03:34,484
Scott: So I tried many things I tried putting.

53
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:53,320
Scott: first I came up with the idea and this idea worked Putting instead of holding on to the thing I put it under my armpit giving me one arm free and a half an arm free whereas other people were holding it in a hand Right, which was meaning giving them one half an arm less than I had, you know for for doing things.

54
00:03:53,922 --> 00:03:57,800
Scott: Also putting it on my body was more stable than your shaky hand.

55
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,077
Scott: Well, because the radio hand is at the end of a lever which is a very bad place to put it.

56
00:04:02,118 --> 00:04:12,237
Scott: then I came with Even better idea and I held it like a running back holds a football or like holding a baby As opposed to holding it just close to the body so that you know It's not at the end of a lever where it's gonna move a lot.

57
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:18,300
Scott: Okay, so then the next thing I did is I just started far away from everyone else the maximum Bluetooth range.

58
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,035
Scott: Everyone else sort of started near each other and I'm like before the match started.

59
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,140
Scott: I'm fucking far away.

60
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:26,200
Scott: Everyone else kills each other and then I go in there's only one person left.

61
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,055
Scott: So I come in at least second place right no matter what.

62
00:04:29,115 --> 00:04:30,000
Rym: not a bad strategy.

63
00:04:30,301 --> 00:04:34,860
Scott: Yeah, I didn't work so well when the last person alive was of course the strongest of the her.

64
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:36,884
Scott: It's not like that.

65
00:04:37,105 --> 00:04:41,180
Scott: It's not like a game where there was health like they were weakened like Smash Brothers or something, right?

66
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,735
Scott: It's they're at full health when you go in there and you're at the same level as they are.

67
00:04:46,157 --> 00:04:46,779
Scott: so good luck.

68
00:04:48,003 --> 00:04:53,292
Scott: one time I Was able to get a kill by pretending to kick someone and he flinched.

69
00:04:54,115 --> 00:04:55,900
Scott: that was a good move, but it didn't work.

70
00:04:56,142 --> 00:04:58,220
Rym: You're not allowed to actually kick people in the shin.

71
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,400
Scott: Well, you don't want to do anything that's illegal or will cause a real fight, you know, cuz you're in a public park, right?

72
00:05:03,781 --> 00:05:07,315
Scott: So I don't think you can punch people in the face cuz that's illegal our fight.

73
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,219
Rym: What about what do you fight?

74
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:08,520
Rym: Club it?

75
00:05:09,063 --> 00:05:10,658
Scott: I don't know, but it's up to you.

76
00:05:11,882 --> 00:05:13,149
Scott: We were in a park with strangers.

77
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,980
Rym: So, you know, so fight club.

78
00:05:16,123 --> 00:05:21,043
Scott: One thing people did to me a lot was they would you know, I would be like all you know I was.

79
00:05:21,204 --> 00:05:24,140
Scott: I was tucked in right and sort of trying to dodge and defend.

80
00:05:24,221 --> 00:05:27,040
Scott: I was all defense early on and I wasn't very good at offense.

81
00:05:28,081 --> 00:05:33,576
Scott: They would just put their hand on my shoulder and shove and then you know Even though I'm facing them sideways to.

82
00:05:33,636 --> 00:05:38,477
Scott: you know I tried to dodge it but they would shove and then my whole body just goes backwards and it's like at you.

83
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:39,240
Rym: so shoving's.

84
00:05:40,242 --> 00:05:41,507
Scott: They shoved pushing.

85
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,279
Scott: I think pushing and shoving or body checking.

86
00:05:44,299 --> 00:05:48,600
Scott: I You wouldn't want to do that because you're guaranteed to lose if you body check.

87
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,623
Rym: What about what if I?

88
00:05:49,703 --> 00:05:49,844
Rym: what?

89
00:05:49,884 --> 00:05:57,109
Rym: if I shoulder check and as I jump forward I keep my hand in the same position Like ah, it's you.

90
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:57,973
Scott: Bruce Lee could do that.

91
00:05:58,054 --> 00:05:59,400
Scott: Bruce Lee would be the king of this game.

92
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,567
Rym: I can work on that fencing the big.

93
00:06:01,747 --> 00:06:05,820
Scott: I think the best attack was sneak up behind someone who doesn't realize you're there.

94
00:06:06,747 --> 00:06:08,460
Scott: No, you just whack their controller.

95
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:13,162
Scott: I was just I smacked like three controllers just down to the ground just like bam Right.

96
00:06:13,182 --> 00:06:18,080
Scott: That's the best move is hit the controller directly just like smack and they're guaranteed to be out.

97
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,719
Scott: There's no defense against that bad.

98
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,959
Scott: But yeah, this game is pretty fun.

99
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:30,307
Scott: It's a little bit flawed if everyone is like us playing to win or if you don't draw the line clearly as to What's legitimate moves.

100
00:06:30,388 --> 00:06:33,060
Scott: it also crashed a lot and had lots of technical difficulties.

101
00:06:33,882 --> 00:06:35,980
Rym: So you got a. play was like running man.

102
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:47,160
Scott: It was difficult in the park to always sort of hear this the music coming from the one sort of crappy little speaker They had if you played it and say an enclosed space with a stereo that everyone could hear very well.

103
00:06:48,361 --> 00:06:50,086
Rym: Here's my question for you.

104
00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:52,876
Rym: Would it be worth it at a convention?

105
00:06:52,916 --> 00:07:00,471
Rym: That's not full of jackasses To bring it and play it If you have enough money that you can buy.

106
00:07:00,491 --> 00:07:03,040
Scott: I think it supports seven or eight of the controllers.

107
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,285
Scott: So how much is a PlayStation?

108
00:07:04,687 --> 00:07:06,293
Rym: So here's a better idea.

109
00:07:06,313 --> 00:07:07,538
Rym: Pax is coming.

110
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:17,261
Rym: Yeah Put out the call be like yo dogs bring your PlayStation controllers to Pax alright, and We'll do this You need.

111
00:07:17,281 --> 00:07:27,990
Scott: you also need a space large enough that is sort of a safe space where people can fall down or push or You know Outside of packs somewhere nearby.

112
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:35,036
Rym: Yeah, maybe in that cool park That's gonna end with someone falling five stories to their death, I think that's the cool part.

113
00:07:35,076 --> 00:07:40,140
Scott: Yeah, but anyway You know, this is a. it is worth checking out if you can.

114
00:07:40,321 --> 00:07:44,860
Scott: I mean, I got a copy of like this alpha version because I kick-started who knows what back in the day.

115
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:47,107
Scott: I'm not sure exactly how you get it.

116
00:07:47,147 --> 00:07:48,952
Scott: Someone else took care of all those logistics.

117
00:07:49,113 --> 00:07:50,818
Scott: I did not, you know inquire enough.

118
00:07:50,878 --> 00:07:56,270
Scott: Nah But yeah Johan Sebastian jazz sounds pretty cool.

119
00:07:56,451 --> 00:08:00,229
Rym: I did not know about this and I didn't know you did that I just thought you were biking in Brooklyn.

120
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:01,658
Rym: I also biked there.

121
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:10,317
Rym: Yeah so if you didn't hear the I guess news that was predicted however long ago this thing day one

122
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:11,139
Scott: when I heard about

123
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:25,800
Rym: it so on live which purported to sell a system of playing games on your computer Remotely meaning all the processing and video card and stuff happens at some remote data center and your key presses.

124
00:08:26,101 --> 00:08:26,723
Rym: It was bullshit.

125
00:08:26,743 --> 00:08:28,689
Rym: It was basically it was listen.

126
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,592
Scott: We did an episode.

127
00:08:29,612 --> 00:08:31,860
Scott: We did this as a news the day it was announced.

128
00:08:32,043 --> 00:08:32,859
Rym: I'll try to find that.

129
00:08:32,982 --> 00:08:40,284
Rym: basically The deal was it was for people who don't have a computer strong enough to do this on their own or can't afford a real Computer or whatever.

130
00:08:40,304 --> 00:08:42,033
Rym: It was stupid.

131
00:08:42,414 --> 00:08:43,320
Rym: We said it was stupid.

132
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:45,165
Scott: They gave up free consoles at some packs.

133
00:08:45,185 --> 00:08:46,710
Scott: which one was?

134
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:50,140
Rym: it was stupid in case you forgot was that sure?

135
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,955
Rym: Maybe if they got it to actually work which back then we weren't even sure.

136
00:08:54,975 --> 00:08:56,480
Scott: if it were they sort of got it to work.

137
00:08:56,521 --> 00:09:09,747
Rym: they did but video cards and home computers are still progressing at such a rate that these things would rapidly become obsolete because they wouldn't be able to play the Newest newest game anyway.

138
00:09:09,908 --> 00:09:11,857
Scott: Well, I mean all it needs to do is stream 1080p, right?

139
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,419
Scott: It's not gonna get any more streamy than that.

140
00:09:14,882 --> 00:09:22,075
Rym: Well, they'd also had to deal with the input back and forth and do like prediction and lag Lag correction and all that to make the game smooth and play a lot of games.

141
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:22,737
Scott: That doesn't matter.

142
00:09:22,818 --> 00:09:27,257
Rym: even yeah but for a lot of games it does and the game has to be available on their platform.

143
00:09:27,318 --> 00:09:31,791
Rym: and Basically, it was silly and it's finally going out of business.

144
00:09:32,032 --> 00:09:34,640
Rym: Yeah, but it went out of business in a complicated way.

145
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:42,240
Rym: So on Friday online last Friday on lives assets were acquired by a newly created company on live.

146
00:09:43,106 --> 00:09:47,720
Rym: No They made a new company called the same name as the old company.

147
00:09:48,076 --> 00:09:55,462
Scott: Well if you owe if the new company acquires the old company and acquires the trademark and can then rename itself to that trademark it just Acquired.

148
00:09:55,482 --> 00:09:57,935
Scott: like if I bought McDonald's I could name my and I was.

149
00:09:58,036 --> 00:09:58,740
Scott: I was Scott Co.

150
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:03,902
Scott: I could rename Scott Co to McDonald's and start using the McDonald's trademark because that's not my property I just bought it.

151
00:10:04,023 --> 00:10:07,898
Rym: So the way they did this is that they did not go into bankruptcy.

152
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:09,889
Rym: instead They did something complicated.

153
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:23,185
Rym: I actually had to read up a little bit called assignment for the benefit of creditors, which basically said they took the company gave it to another company in validating all the stock options and any Investments from any outsiders.

154
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:30,531
Rym: so all the people who invested in this and all the employees who by the way pretty much were all laid Off at least half were laid off immediately.

155
00:10:30,571 --> 00:10:31,314
Rym: as far as I can tell.

156
00:10:31,354 --> 00:10:32,600
Rym: I think they're all going away.

157
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,480
Scott: I thought it said half were getting hired by the new company half were offered new jobs at the new company.

158
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,297
Rym: Okay, so we'll see what happens with that.

159
00:10:40,338 --> 00:10:42,800
Scott: Whatever But why are you working on live?

160
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:51,828
Rym: This thing was a disaster from day one and I feel kind of indicated in the fact that I said Okay, so this is what the thing is.

161
00:10:51,848 --> 00:10:53,413
Scott: I want to you know who cares about online.

162
00:10:53,473 --> 00:10:55,800
Scott: right here's is something I do care about.

163
00:10:56,344 --> 00:11:06,032
Scott: It seems like in the gaming industry You can only really succeed if your scale is enormous Like you need to sell a zillion consoles or a zillion right.

164
00:11:06,072 --> 00:11:08,140
Scott: and we sort of know this because you know.

165
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:13,560
Scott: The reason is if you're a platform of game development You know, we're only talking about platforms.

166
00:11:14,262 --> 00:11:15,425
Rym: Games don't need to scare.

167
00:11:15,465 --> 00:11:28,530
Scott: you need to be very huge in order to attract developers of good games right such that you know people want the console because this games of it platform because this games available on it and So people will make you there won't.

168
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,906
Scott: there'll be games for it period Cuz it.

169
00:11:30,946 --> 00:11:33,200
Scott: no one's developing for you because your audience is too small.

170
00:11:33,862 --> 00:11:37,273
Scott: so it's like you can only really have a successful gaming platform if you're really big.

171
00:11:37,293 --> 00:11:41,079
Scott: and it's kind of said because I sort of Wish like wouldn't it be cool?

172
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:54,607
Scott: Like if there wasn't just like these mega gaming platforms like Steam Xbox PlayStation We DS PSP if there were say a bunch of medium-sized gaming platforms that weren't necessarily You know super successful.

173
00:11:55,109 --> 00:11:55,952
Scott: They don't really need to be.

174
00:11:55,992 --> 00:11:58,180
Scott: they just need to be profitable and they keep going.

175
00:11:58,762 --> 00:11:59,847
Scott: It would be kind of cool.

176
00:11:59,867 --> 00:12:02,699
Scott: I don't know how impossible well the thing but it would be neat for me.

177
00:12:03,383 --> 00:12:04,188
Rym: I have a PC.

178
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:05,759
Rym: it can run any arbitrary code.

179
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:06,883
Scott: I know that.

180
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:09,311
Rym: so I don't need a platform right.

181
00:12:09,331 --> 00:12:11,740
Rym: but I mean team just does all these niceties for me.

182
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:21,840
Scott: But I just wish that there were just sort of like, you know These medium-sized it was possible for there be a medium-sized player in the gaming really want in in the in the console or platform world.

183
00:12:22,681 --> 00:12:25,332
Rym: What is a medium-sized player really provide other than now?

184
00:12:25,773 --> 00:12:27,420
Rym: I gotta log into this other stupid thing.

185
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,254
Scott: What I imagine a medium-sized player to be would be something specialized.

186
00:12:32,414 --> 00:12:34,440
Rym: because alright so like blizzards crap.

187
00:12:34,761 --> 00:12:37,912
Rym: No, no, no all like somebody makes a platform.

188
00:12:37,953 --> 00:12:38,535
Rym: that bullshit.

189
00:12:38,555 --> 00:12:39,960
Rym: I have to log into for Starcraft.

190
00:12:40,181 --> 00:12:46,120
Scott: No, somebody would make like a console and the console it specializes in one kind of game, right?

191
00:12:46,461 --> 00:12:53,962
Scott: It's like this is the sports game Console thing and it just fucking kicks so much ass at sports games Station.

192
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,187
Rym: both kick-ass just fine.

193
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:57,615
Scott: I mean, I'm just coming up with any exact way.

194
00:12:57,716 --> 00:13:01,825
Scott: There's a Frickin.

195
00:13:02,028 --> 00:13:02,252
Rym: I guess.

196
00:13:02,293 --> 00:13:02,619
Rym: what is it?

197
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:11,260
Rym: What are these I have to offer that a PC doesn't because the more niche you get the more likely it is that the people Who play and make those games are all on the PC anyway?

198
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,620
Scott: Yeah, some you would need to be something, you know inventive that had like a specialized harder maybe like a bimani specialized platform.

199
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,465
Scott: it's like that's.

200
00:13:18,525 --> 00:13:27,480
Rym: you don't need a platform for that because the Good part about bimani games is that everyone has a completely unique interface.

201
00:13:28,681 --> 00:13:29,503
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

202
00:13:29,905 --> 00:13:34,280
Rym: And the old the closest thing to a platform that we had like that was in the groove which is gone.

203
00:13:36,381 --> 00:13:39,258
Rym: I'm just you know, just I just did a bunch of research on this.

204
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:43,813
Scott: for packs Yeah, I just wish it was possible for there to be something that was sort of unique.

205
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:46,000
Rym: There is what about direct-to-drive?

206
00:13:48,525 --> 00:13:50,679
Rym: I Okay, that was great wasn't it?

207
00:13:50,940 --> 00:14:11,114
Scott: No, I just mean, you know, there would be something unique that appealed to a medium-sized audience didn't need you know and even though it never grew to be super huge and everywhere and even though it you know succeeded about as well as on live succeeded could be profitable and stick around and have its fans and do its thing.

208
00:14:11,155 --> 00:14:13,483
Rym: but why would anyone be a fan of a Platform?

209
00:14:13,523 --> 00:14:16,580
Rym: the put the important parts the games remember I look at it from my perspective.

210
00:14:16,661 --> 00:14:19,280
Rym: I'm a gamer and you know design or whatever aside.

211
00:14:19,602 --> 00:14:23,280
Rym: I just want to play my games want to play my games in the easiest way possible.

212
00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:24,885
Scott: What if there was some cool thing?

213
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,009
Rym: is it better than steam?

214
00:14:26,631 --> 00:14:28,056
Scott: It's not competing with steam.

215
00:14:28,136 --> 00:14:32,673
Scott: How not steam Some sort of device or maybe it's a mobile thing.

216
00:14:32,713 --> 00:14:33,074
Scott: Who knows?

217
00:14:33,175 --> 00:14:33,637
Rym: It's okay.

218
00:14:33,677 --> 00:14:34,240
Rym: So a device.

219
00:14:35,102 --> 00:14:43,528
Scott: There is some gaming platform that offers something that other gaming platforms do not but it's not something that everyone really cares about Something that only certain.

220
00:14:43,609 --> 00:14:43,951
Scott: Okay.

221
00:14:43,991 --> 00:14:44,554
Rym: So, let's see.

222
00:14:44,595 --> 00:14:45,440
Rym: What do I care about?

223
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,386
Rym: Keyboard and mouse awesome first-person shooters.

224
00:14:48,406 --> 00:14:50,471
Rym: I have a console for that.

225
00:14:50,531 --> 00:14:51,814
Rym: Well, that's you a computer.

226
00:14:51,834 --> 00:14:56,269
Rym: All right, RTS keyboard and mouse Dancing games.

227
00:14:56,309 --> 00:14:59,102
Rym: Well, they all need a unique Piece.

228
00:14:59,122 --> 00:15:00,005
Rym: DDR is DDR.

229
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:02,192
Rym: There's a you know, there's dozens of DDR games.

230
00:15:02,774 --> 00:15:03,155
Rym: They all have.

231
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,420
Rym: I guess that's a platform.

232
00:15:05,229 --> 00:15:08,546
Scott: I'm just saying it's That's just a controller.

233
00:15:08,587 --> 00:15:10,193
Rym: So you're saying you want a controller?

234
00:15:10,213 --> 00:15:11,700
Scott: No, I'm just saying it's.

235
00:15:12,441 --> 00:15:14,690
Scott: Can there be a medium-sized player?

236
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,677
Scott: It's all got to be go big or go home.

237
00:15:16,717 --> 00:15:20,493
Rym: I think for all the reasons I just illustrated there's no benefit to a medium-sized player.

238
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:21,980
Rym: but Steve look at steam.

239
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:27,079
Rym: If you're if you are a PC gamer of any kind steam is pretty much got you back.

240
00:15:27,981 --> 00:15:34,976
Scott: I'm just saying I recognize the reality of why there is no medium-sized player, but I'm saying if the reality were different It would be nice.

241
00:15:35,582 --> 00:15:38,373
Scott: Imagine if there were just a bunch of medium-sized players.

242
00:15:38,413 --> 00:15:40,160
Rym: Higgs bosons were made of chocolate.

243
00:15:42,521 --> 00:15:44,206
Rym: I don't see any utility in this.

244
00:15:44,787 --> 00:15:45,349
Rym: I don't see any.

245
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:47,735
Rym: I don't see another platform.

246
00:15:47,755 --> 00:15:52,569
Scott: I'd Scott the ooh, yeah Guys, no, that's not going anywhere.

247
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:53,934
Rym: But it's a platform.

248
00:15:53,994 --> 00:16:02,792
Rym: It's too small size player Specialized for crappy droid-style angry games.

249
00:16:02,832 --> 00:16:03,514
Scott: Yeah bad idea.

250
00:16:03,735 --> 00:16:05,640
Rym: This is exactly what you asked for Scott.

251
00:16:05,781 --> 00:16:07,499
Rym: Yeah, no you wanted I'm mask.

252
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:16,220
Scott: Imagine if instead of like, you know, the like three like we Xbox PlayStation there were like ten consoles that were all sort of even.

253
00:16:18,281 --> 00:16:19,828
Rym: That would be a disaster.

254
00:16:19,969 --> 00:16:22,239
Rym: is there any game that's exclusive to one and not another?

255
00:16:23,386 --> 00:16:23,940
Rym: Don't you bitch?

256
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,507
Scott: You're a game developer, right?

257
00:16:26,588 --> 00:16:30,160
Scott: Which one of the ten consoles do you make your game for whichever one's most popular?

258
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,389
Rym: Cuz it's stupid to serve.

259
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,699
Scott: They're all sort of equal.

260
00:16:33,722 --> 00:16:35,768
Rym: Then you all collude and pick one.

261
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:37,954
Rym: that cuz that's to everyone's benefit.

262
00:16:38,255 --> 00:16:40,080
Rym: what makes one of those different from another one?

263
00:16:40,302 --> 00:16:42,439
Rym: What makes an Xbox really different from a ps3?

264
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,536
Rym: Crook slightly, so yeah, so there's no effective real difference other than fake exclusivity.

265
00:16:48,556 --> 00:16:49,820
Rym: Yeah, it's artificial.

266
00:16:50,683 --> 00:16:52,810
Rym: You you don't want anything.

267
00:16:53,111 --> 00:16:54,636
Rym: you want a thing that can't be a thing.

268
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:55,980
Rym: I want to be omnipotent.

269
00:16:56,121 --> 00:16:59,011
Rym: I just went on mission, but I want to be surprised.

270
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,400
Scott: I'm just saying is it there was you know competition?

271
00:17:02,082 --> 00:17:09,892
Rym: All right, so what should steam do that they're not doing, you know Competition.

272
00:17:09,993 --> 00:17:20,280
Scott: it'd be cool If some guy could set up a gaming company in his garage and be successful even though he didn't Sell you because he sells games not consoles or platform.

273
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,528
Rym: That's that's where the magic is.

274
00:17:23,888 --> 00:17:25,474
Rym: Anyway, anyway, the oh, yeah stupid.

275
00:17:25,494 --> 00:17:26,137
Rym: You shouldn't buy one.

276
00:17:26,156 --> 00:17:26,980
Rym: You shouldn't buy anything.

277
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:33,400
Rym: That's not a big player because middle and small and the online was silly and you shouldn't have bought one.

278
00:17:33,601 --> 00:17:34,750
Rym: Yeah, but here's the funny thing.

279
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:35,495
Rym: and then let's move on.

280
00:17:35,918 --> 00:17:38,247
Rym: so From one article I read today.

281
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:40,976
Rym: The company says it has more than 1.5 million active users.

282
00:17:42,943 --> 00:17:50,935
Rym: I found two other articles that say here's a quote from one of these Some of the news coming out of the whole event says that on live averaged about 1,800 users.

283
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:54,287
Scott: Yeah, how many of those?

284
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:55,110
Scott: one and a half million?

285
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:59,630
Scott: where you gave away a free console and counted that is one Yeah, but it's the same way as Facebook.

286
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:01,320
Scott: It's like well, there are this many accounts.

287
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,327
Scott: They just did a count star on the users table.

288
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:03,989
Scott: It's like guys.

289
00:18:04,431 --> 00:18:05,093
Scott: that doesn't count.

290
00:18:05,153 --> 00:18:06,980
Scott: how many people logged in today?

291
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,421
Scott: - spammers, okay 1,800 users, let's see.

292
00:18:09,462 --> 00:18:26,813
Rym: right now on Steam If you go to 1,800 users, you are slightly more popular than just cause - okay and slightly less popular Than Batman Arkham City and you're an order of magnitude below Counter-Strike source.

293
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:35,228
Rym: Counter-Strike 1 6 and Counter-Strike go Individually, okay, so you got any news.

294
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:36,770
Rym: then we can bust into the best game ever.

295
00:18:37,051 --> 00:18:37,994
Scott: I have a sad news.

296
00:18:38,395 --> 00:18:41,324
Scott: Well sort of I guess something you sort of realize.

297
00:18:41,344 --> 00:18:43,210
Scott: you just didn't think about it specifically, right?

298
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:48,617
Scott: It's like, you know Magazines be dead But you didn't think specifically.

299
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:52,530
Scott: Oh shit Nintendo power is done because it is.

300
00:18:53,636 --> 00:18:55,401
Scott: Huh You know what?

301
00:18:55,421 --> 00:18:59,841
Rym: I Stopped subscribing to Nintendo power right after the 200th episode.

302
00:19:00,203 --> 00:19:01,928
Rym: I almost said episode the 200th one.

303
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:05,244
Rym: I think that was a Legend of Zelda special or something.

304
00:19:05,264 --> 00:19:05,807
Rym: Let me look it up.

305
00:19:05,968 --> 00:19:09,969
Scott: They have They have something special planned for the final issue.

306
00:19:10,932 --> 00:19:13,780
Scott: There you know, they're gonna put that in 10 of our 200.

307
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,405
Rym: Uh, no, no wrong ring.

308
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:15,766
Rym: Never mind.

309
00:19:16,107 --> 00:19:16,829
Scott: Yeah, anyway, didn't you?

310
00:19:18,151 --> 00:19:21,184
Scott: But yeah, Nintendo power back in the day super important.

311
00:19:21,264 --> 00:19:22,449
Scott: now not important at all.

312
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:26,830
Rym: I would argue that Nintendo power was only actually important back in the day because there was no internet.

313
00:19:26,951 --> 00:19:28,842
Rym: No, and I thought we did a show on Nintendo power.

314
00:19:28,882 --> 00:19:31,652
Scott: I think I think we might have and Really?

315
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:34,523
Rym: The only purpose that served for me was to vicariously live the games.

316
00:19:34,543 --> 00:19:35,527
Rym: My parents wouldn't buy me.

317
00:19:35,768 --> 00:19:45,705
Scott: Yep But yeah, this is if you really want to get the idea of what it was like back in those magazine days You should play Game Center CX for the.

318
00:19:46,734 --> 00:19:47,869
Scott: You know the DS.

319
00:19:48,891 --> 00:19:52,769
Rym: Because oh, yeah, that's a good game that does pretty well replicate the experience.

320
00:19:54,573 --> 00:19:56,122
Scott: It just said I just want to bring it up.

321
00:19:56,243 --> 00:19:57,229
Scott: What else do we like to say?

322
00:19:58,691 --> 00:19:59,716
Scott: It's not needed anymore.

323
00:19:59,797 --> 00:20:06,130
Scott: But I do think see you at the crossroads Nintendo power I hope someone I'm sure there's somewhere we can download like a scan of every Nintendo.

324
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,310
Rym: I should get a bunch of people to go out and pour a bottle of whiskey into the river or something.

325
00:20:11,112 --> 00:20:11,775
Scott: You can pay for that.

326
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:13,864
Scott: Yeah, I'll pour some $5 hobo one.

327
00:20:13,884 --> 00:20:16,735
Scott: That's that's about the right price I have.

328
00:20:16,755 --> 00:20:18,830
Rym: you know, I have fine memories of Nintendo power.

329
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,723
Scott: I also have some fond memories even though mostly I had game pro.

330
00:20:21,984 --> 00:20:26,310
Scott: In fact, I'm pro sucked You know game bro, they all sucked right every video game.

331
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:30,606
Rym: No, Nintendo power was great because it didn't even pretend it wasn't just an ad right.

332
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:35,323
Scott: but game pro At least when I started getting it was actually just as good as Nintendo power.

333
00:20:35,404 --> 00:20:42,852
Rym: only it didn't cover just Nintendo But just Nintendo was all I wanted at that point from about Nintendo power one through about 90.

334
00:20:42,852 --> 00:20:45,041
Rym: Nintendo was all I gave one fuck about.

335
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:47,009
Scott: yes, I don't even have any magazine in those days.

336
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,740
Rym: I subscribe to Nintendo power from one.

337
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,230
Rym: Yeah, we got every single one of those bitches.

338
00:20:54,594 --> 00:20:56,449
Scott: But yeah video game.

339
00:21:02,663 --> 00:21:05,280
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

340
00:21:06,062 --> 00:21:10,213
Rym: So monkey magic is a band that many of you have probably never heard of.

341
00:21:10,273 --> 00:21:15,088
Rym: there are Japanese Canadian like pop band And that's unique.

342
00:21:15,128 --> 00:21:25,519
Rym: at least yeah and For various reasons I've been a fan of them for a while and All I want to say is this is a music video from them.

343
00:21:26,162 --> 00:21:33,591
Rym: That's about Lupin the third and it's to the melody of the Lupin the third theme But with lyrics and it's animated with Lupin.

344
00:21:33,631 --> 00:21:34,093
Rym: It's pretty good.

345
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:36,179
Scott: Okay, so check this video out.

346
00:21:36,864 --> 00:21:40,447
Scott: Since I got my new powerful computer I've been doing what I can do with.

347
00:21:40,487 --> 00:21:51,880
Scott: it is something I couldn't do before which is play a game with full settings Obviously, but more so than that I can use fraps to record the game at full settings without losing any frames Which is pretty amazing.

348
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:57,857
Scott: So I've been trying to think of awesome things to make besides boring as let's play videos and bullshit like that.

349
00:21:58,338 --> 00:22:01,448
Rym: random aside Let's play has run its course guys.

350
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:02,351
Rym: You can stop now.

351
00:22:02,431 --> 00:22:06,800
Scott: Yeah, I think I think we have let's play of every game But they're terrible.

352
00:22:06,841 --> 00:22:07,275
Rym: Yeah.

353
00:22:08,102 --> 00:22:10,129
Scott: So anyway, someone here gave something.

354
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:13,660
Scott: gave did something that sort of gave me a good idea and is a good thing of the day.

355
00:22:14,202 --> 00:22:16,091
Scott: It is Half-Life 2 crossbow endurance.

356
00:22:16,151 --> 00:22:24,600
Scott: And basically what he did is he killed 538 things with the crossbow and Half-Life 2 which is the most satisfying weapon in gaming history.

357
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,071
Rym: It's amazing fucking gun other than the plasma gun or the double shot.

358
00:22:28,091 --> 00:22:29,295
Rym: You go to gun.

359
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:31,564
Scott: It's not really it's a crossbow It's not a gun.

360
00:22:31,665 --> 00:22:33,679
Scott: Um shoots a pot rebar.

361
00:22:35,463 --> 00:22:36,619
Scott: It has a scope on.

362
00:22:39,332 --> 00:22:49,236
Scott: But yeah he took video of 538 crossbow shots and he used them as the bass drum for the song cotton-eyed Joe.

363
00:22:49,497 --> 00:22:50,620
Scott: This video is pretty awesome.

364
00:22:51,262 --> 00:22:51,624
Scott: Check it out.

365
00:22:52,467 --> 00:22:55,860
Rym: So should we do a super cut of like every time you kill a dude in a game?

366
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:56,642
Scott: I don't know.

367
00:22:57,486 --> 00:22:59,980
Scott: I'm just gonna start recording a lot of gameplay Scott.

368
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:05,340
Rym: Here's a super cut we could do beat mario 1 and super cut together every time a bad guy dies on screen.

369
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:21,267
Rym: Just Anyway, so Well, there might not be in the meta moment a lot of GeekNights for the next month or so It's a long time without a GeekNights So we're gonna try to get some guest episodes up.

370
00:23:21,307 --> 00:23:25,180
Rym: But basically what's happening is PAX is this weekend next weekend.

371
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:27,696
Rym: Yeah, oh my god, if it was this weekend, I'd be in trouble.

372
00:23:27,857 --> 00:23:32,107
Rym: Yeah and Independent of PAX Scott is not going home from PAX.

373
00:23:32,127 --> 00:23:33,732
Rym: He's going to DC for Jenga Khan.

374
00:23:33,893 --> 00:23:34,374
Scott: That's right.

375
00:23:34,635 --> 00:23:48,124
Rym: And right after Scott gets back I'm probably going to Istanbul for like a week and then I'm either gonna be in Hong Kong or Singapore or possibly Germany or maybe Poland and All of the above.

376
00:23:48,145 --> 00:23:58,513
Rym: Yeah, so between all this there's gonna be a dearth of GeekNights but This happens every few years when the stars align and we get busy with our real.

377
00:23:58,573 --> 00:24:04,760
Scott: this is good because when we when GeekNights Returns the fuel tank will be fully stocked of fuel.

378
00:24:05,001 --> 00:24:10,120
Rym: Oh also, we're going to PAX dev - so we're flying out like Tuesday next week.

379
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:15,019
Rym: Yeah, there probably won't be any shows either after today or after Thursday for a while.

380
00:24:15,965 --> 00:24:18,159
Scott: Let us give you a new normal show.

381
00:24:18,661 --> 00:24:23,035
Scott: If you find yourself in need of podcast and GeekNights is not available.

382
00:24:23,075 --> 00:24:27,370
Scott: fast karate for the gentleman May I suggest fast karate for the gentleman.

383
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:30,280
Rym: that is in fact my favorite podcast.

384
00:24:30,521 --> 00:24:30,962
Scott: I haven't.

385
00:24:31,022 --> 00:24:33,089
Rym: Dave Riley is one of my favorite people.

386
00:24:33,109 --> 00:24:36,400
Scott: I mean, I will honest I have not listened in years.

387
00:24:36,681 --> 00:24:37,082
Rym: You know what?

388
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:37,805
Rym: It hasn't changed.

389
00:24:38,025 --> 00:24:40,995
Rym: I know the one thing I will say Dave Riley stopped listening.

390
00:24:41,036 --> 00:24:41,297
Scott: in the 24 era.

391
00:24:41,317 --> 00:24:49,390
Rym: Dave Riley finally took me up on the offer to like for real do panels Need a panel at Connecticut for us and it was great.

392
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,240
Rym: and he did the same panel at Otakon and he's stepping up his game.

393
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,490
Rym: So you should reward Dave Riley for stepping up his game.

394
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,235
Rym: I'll Joe white - I keeps.

395
00:24:57,335 --> 00:24:58,920
Rym: I talked to Dave more.

396
00:24:59,181 --> 00:25:01,271
Rym: That's the only reason I'm saying Dave more than Joel.

397
00:25:01,894 --> 00:25:03,160
Rym: Well, also Joel didn't come to Connecticut.

398
00:25:03,601 --> 00:25:06,030
Scott: We can support Dave bomb is smart and move to New York.

399
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,412
Scott: Therefore.

400
00:25:06,452 --> 00:25:07,395
Scott: He gets more Joel.

401
00:25:07,857 --> 00:25:08,720
Rym: You should move to New York.

402
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,139
Rym: In fact, I know someone who's a roommate.

403
00:25:13,103 --> 00:25:16,320
Rym: But anyway, no, I talked to Dave more but usually indirectly via Twitter.

404
00:25:17,222 --> 00:25:21,100
Rym: If you want some horror fiction check out pseudopod, it's actually really good.

405
00:25:21,381 --> 00:25:25,558
Scott: If you care about sports, there's this TV show on ESPN called PTI.

406
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:31,949
Scott: It's pretty much the only show on ESPN worth paying attention to because ESPN is the worst And they have a podcast.

407
00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:40,660
Scott: it's pretty much just audio of the show So you don't have to watch it on cable television Especially if you don't have cable television and it's totally free and I listen to it every day.

408
00:25:40,821 --> 00:25:44,700
Scott: But it's actually on hiatus for this week because of Little League World Series.

409
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,007
Scott: It'll be back next week when GeekNights disappears.

410
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:47,729
Scott: What a coincidence.

411
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,996
Rym: We will likely have guest episodes and such.

412
00:25:50,056 --> 00:25:56,294
Rym: I'll try to upload a One maybe a radio free equestria of some fashion before I disappear.

413
00:25:56,535 --> 00:26:09,500
Scott: and lastly, you know If you're not going to PAX and you really would need some GeekNights, even though there won't be new podcast episodes There will still be plenty of GeekNights content in the form of say videos Photos

414
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,104
Rym: Tweets the last thousand All of which are

415
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:13,786
Scott: online.

416
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:15,572
Scott: So make sure to go to our website.

417
00:26:15,613 --> 00:26:21,420
Scott: go to Twitter's Facebook Google+ The email newsletter which you can subscribe on the website.

418
00:26:22,643 --> 00:26:26,400
Rym: Who can't go to pecs, you know a lot of our pecs lectures are on our website.

419
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:32,060
Scott: Join our steam group and play kind of straight go and other games with other listeners.

420
00:26:32,522 --> 00:26:35,860
Scott: There is a lot of GeekNights you can do for the next few weeks.

421
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:41,507
Rym: I wonder if they all realize that this is all just a lie to cover for the fact that we're gonna play counter-strike go constantly For the next three months.

422
00:26:41,668 --> 00:26:42,353
Scott: We're all take we're.

423
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:43,220
Scott: actually it's a secret.

424
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:49,656
Scott: We're taking a week off month off of work to play counter-strike, you know If I took a month off to play I would not play counter-strike.

425
00:26:49,676 --> 00:26:52,099
Scott: if I had a month off I mean I played some.

426
00:26:52,961 --> 00:26:55,011
Scott: No, that would not be my activity for a month.

427
00:26:55,091 --> 00:26:57,020
Rym: I took a month off to train in counter-strike.

428
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,592
Rym: I think I could step up to my previous former glory.

429
00:27:00,612 --> 00:27:02,780
Scott: thing is I'm gonna be honest, right?

430
00:27:03,162 --> 00:27:03,644
Scott: Too old?

431
00:27:03,925 --> 00:27:11,515
Scott: no, if I actually had time to train at a game I would probably train at a game that needed more training like dota or something.

432
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:28,515
Rym: I Don't know if you'd enjoy dota Scott playing dota 2 at the level of the people who play dota 2 or Being that guy who single-handedly kills 14 people on the enemy team with a pistol.

433
00:27:28,696 --> 00:27:29,940
Scott: Nobody is that guy?

434
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,953
Scott: I just you know who that guy is the cheater.

435
00:27:31,994 --> 00:27:36,272
Rym: That's that guy I played on source and actually I got.

436
00:27:36,312 --> 00:27:37,456
Scott: I mean, I'm already.

437
00:27:37,476 --> 00:27:39,322
Scott: I mean, I'm not the greatest I'm certain.

438
00:27:39,342 --> 00:27:43,660
Scott: my main problem is I'm inconsistent, you know, like one match I'll suck and one match will be awesome.

439
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,107
Scott: But it's like sometimes about half the time.

440
00:27:46,628 --> 00:27:49,897
Scott: I'm the guy who kills two guys with the deagle like boom.

441
00:27:49,937 --> 00:27:50,418
Scott: Boom.

442
00:27:50,579 --> 00:27:52,605
Scott: That's it You know and it's I can.

443
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:55,897
Scott: definitely it's like it's a. it's not a luck thing because it's like.

444
00:27:55,937 --> 00:27:57,834
Scott: I was trying to do it And I did it, you know.

445
00:27:59,223 --> 00:28:03,960
Scott: In one then other times I'm the guy where I go around the corner and I die and I didn't even to see anybody.

446
00:28:04,721 --> 00:28:04,982
Rym: All right.

447
00:28:05,042 --> 00:28:06,990
Rym: Well, I think we should just talk about the show.

448
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,756
Scott: I was trying to segue into it.

449
00:28:08,997 --> 00:28:13,020
Rym: Okay, though Last thing we are doing three events between PAX Prime and past dev.

450
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,060
Rym: We are doing academia versus reality psychology game theory and games.

451
00:28:16,381 --> 00:28:18,529
Rym: Wednesday August 29th at 2 30 and grand.

452
00:28:18,569 --> 00:28:19,814
Scott: to think people really need to know this.

453
00:28:19,854 --> 00:28:21,280
Scott: if they're going they'll see us on the schedule.

454
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:25,818
Rym: Short subjects in gaming Friday, August 31st 3 30 in the wolf man and the GeekNights board game workshop.

455
00:28:25,878 --> 00:28:27,765
Rym: Saturday September 1st at 8 p.m.

456
00:28:27,785 --> 00:28:29,450
Rym: In room 302.

457
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,718
Scott: if you're going to PAX you look in the guidebook you search for us.

458
00:28:31,758 --> 00:28:34,834
Scott: You'll find it Yeah, so yeah counter-strike.

459
00:28:34,854 --> 00:28:38,450
Rym: So right now Global offensive doesn't appear to be beta anymore.

460
00:28:39,293 --> 00:28:40,277
Scott: I thought it launched it.

461
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:40,860
Scott: When does it launch?

462
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,349
Rym: Well apparently right now because here are the.

463
00:28:43,912 --> 00:28:55,629
Rym: here's why we're talking about counter-strike Right now the top game on steam as in total over people playing right this second at 643 p.m On Friday or Friday.

464
00:28:56,031 --> 00:29:00,507
Rym: on Tuesday August 21st 68,000 people are playing Team Fortress 2.

465
00:29:00,507 --> 00:29:01,631
Rym: Okay, 49,000 people are playing Dota 2.

466
00:29:01,631 --> 00:29:07,540
Rym: Okay 39,000 people are playing counter-strike global offense.

467
00:29:07,741 --> 00:29:16,919
Scott: So this 10. so if you take all the people who are playing Counter-strike go and add 10,000. that's when you people are playing Dota 2 and you add like few fat tens of thousands more.

468
00:29:16,939 --> 00:29:20,019
Rym: now It says counter-strike global offensive not beta.

469
00:29:21,067 --> 00:29:21,679
Rym: beta disappeared.

470
00:29:22,482 --> 00:29:27,403
Rym: Football manager 38,000 Counter-strike at 32,000. that's counter-strike 1.6.

471
00:29:27,403 --> 00:29:34,848
Scott: elder scrolls at 26,000 Civ 5 at 22,000 Counter-strike source at 21,000.

472
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:43,380
Scott: So if you add up the three counter-strikes together Now they're more than the Team Fortress 2 by a lot by tens of thousands.

473
00:29:43,521 --> 00:29:48,379
Scott: So at first glance is like Oh counter-strike not as popular as tf2 or Dota 2.

474
00:29:48,379 --> 00:29:53,907
Rym: meanwhile Actually for a game that is as old as shit counter-strike came out in what 1999 or 2000.

475
00:29:53,907 --> 00:29:58,283
Scott: I first played it At RIT.

476
00:29:58,545 --> 00:30:01,840
Scott: I played it at RIT and let me tell you I think we did a counter-strike show.

477
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,271
Rym: So I don't want to reiterate too much.

478
00:30:03,412 --> 00:30:06,854
Rym: but basically Scott I don't know if Scott told me or I told him or what.

479
00:30:06,914 --> 00:30:13,899
Scott: I just remember no CS lab guy talked about counter-strike and he said yeah when you die you don't respond and I was like wants to play that?

480
00:30:14,702 --> 00:30:15,967
Rym: See I remember I started playing.

481
00:30:15,987 --> 00:30:16,729
Rym: then I played it.

482
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:22,688
Rym: this looks like action quake - this is gonna be fuck and I was dead And then I'd start a new round is dead.

483
00:30:22,909 --> 00:30:25,460
Scott: I think we're recapping the original counter-strike show materials.

484
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,625
Scott: Let's talk about CS go.

485
00:30:26,686 --> 00:30:28,997
Rym: The point is counter-strike go is the game.

486
00:30:29,017 --> 00:30:34,011
Rym: So I Have waited for ever For I don't know.

487
00:30:34,052 --> 00:30:44,900
Rym: Team Fortress 2 tribes 2 - Civilization 5 these are games that like we're on the horizon of my life for as long as they could possibly be Duke Nukem forever.

488
00:30:45,821 --> 00:31:00,759
Rym: Counter-strike go is the first game in a long time that I was personally excited about To an undue degree and when it came out the dunas was not un undeserved.

489
00:31:02,721 --> 00:31:04,266
Rym: Counter-strike go is great.

490
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:08,138
Rym: It is literally just the next step from counter-strike source, right?

491
00:31:08,178 --> 00:31:09,951
Scott: So, let's see What is counter-strike go?

492
00:31:10,193 --> 00:31:10,960
Scott: It's counter-strike.

493
00:31:11,081 --> 00:31:14,194
Scott: It is a hundred percent counter-strike, but what has changed?

494
00:31:14,254 --> 00:31:15,640
Scott: Well, the first thing that has changed.

495
00:31:15,761 --> 00:31:19,700
Scott: I'm gonna start with the most significant change at least in my opinion and then you can do yours, right?

496
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:33,229
Scott: All right I think the most significant change in counter-strike source is The change in the interface that puts a lot more focus on which team has won and the fact that when you play Say like a map rotation.

497
00:31:33,531 --> 00:31:52,300
Scott: It's actually like you're playing to 10 or you're playing to 16 or whatever it is and I've noticed that because of that emphasis in the interface The biggest numbers are CT wins versus T wins and it you know It really gives you that terrorists win is a lot more emphasized.

498
00:31:53,182 --> 00:32:01,470
Scott: I see a lot more bomb planting and hostage rescuing than in source or Original on public servers than I have ever seen.

499
00:32:01,671 --> 00:32:07,169
Rym: I am going to make a minor counter-argument That we've been playing the counter-strike go beta.

500
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:18,520
Rym: it's mostly people who already know the deal with counter-strike Clanny scrimmy type people who are playing this game now to get an edge when competitive play starts for real.

501
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:26,027
Rym: But when you go to counter-strike if you and you've been playing the mode I've been playing Real mode competitive mode, right?

502
00:32:26,629 --> 00:32:30,740
Rym: Which again is a self-selected sample of the people who want all of that stuff.

503
00:32:31,022 --> 00:32:32,852
Scott: Well, here's the thing they change my fight.

504
00:32:32,892 --> 00:32:40,099
Rym: my final minor counter-argument The all the things you're describing Like, you know, the the number of matches and switching teams and all that.

505
00:32:40,602 --> 00:32:44,020
Rym: That's how scrims have worked in counter-strike source forever, right?

506
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,320
Scott: But here's the thing because it is encoded in the software, right?

507
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,867
Scott: And it's sort of the default mode.

508
00:32:49,907 --> 00:32:55,300
Scott: if you go in to open up counter-strike old counter-strike Right any either of the old ones and you want to play online?

509
00:32:55,661 --> 00:32:57,608
Scott: It brings up old-school server browser.

510
00:32:57,649 --> 00:32:59,234
Scott: find a server and play right.

511
00:32:59,696 --> 00:33:03,700
Scott: or I think this is like a quick Connect button which randomly finds a server low.

512
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:11,020
Rym: You know, I agree with you here because in that in that model I went to my like clan server and played with the same people all the sudden new counter-strike.

513
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,284
Scott: This is for.

514
00:33:12,304 --> 00:33:14,271
Scott: it is actually four different ways to get into a game.

515
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:15,876
Scott: There's like start a server.

516
00:33:15,956 --> 00:33:19,240
Scott: There's Go bring up the old-school server list.

517
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:27,440
Scott: There's all these modes but the mode I actually use is the baby mode or you would think is the baby mode which is Find game and you could find game and there's four choices.

518
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:31,279
Scott: The four choices are I want to play gun game, which is called arms race.

519
00:33:31,339 --> 00:33:37,037
Scott: now I want to play demolition which is sort of a combination of gun game and regular counter-strike.

520
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:42,220
Scott: I Want to play, you know real counter-strike, but sort of casual mode, right?

521
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:47,917
Scott: No friendly fire and such and such or I want to play counter-strike for serious friendly fire on.

522
00:33:47,937 --> 00:34:07,879
Scott: let's play real counter-strike And if you click either of those last two options, it's gonna put you on a server right that is running Default counter-strike five on five where bots replace missing players and You actually will you know set a number of rounds say 20 rounds first to 11, you know, 10 wins

523
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:12,601
Rym: It's best whoever is best of 30.

524
00:34:12,601 --> 00:34:17,945
Rym: So as soon as you get that 16th win as a team a lot of the servers I've done our best of 20 Really?

525
00:34:17,985 --> 00:34:19,018
Rym: I've never seen that.

526
00:34:19,884 --> 00:34:22,137
Scott: Anyway, I've also seen the servers that are get the 16th win.

527
00:34:23,782 --> 00:34:29,060
Rym: But the great part is it you play as one team and then your team's swap and you play the other side.

528
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:36,960
Scott: So if you're doing best of 30 in the fit You'll play 15 rounds as counter-terrorists and in the 16th round you'll switch to being terrorists.

529
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:37,362
Scott: Now you might.

530
00:34:37,402 --> 00:34:41,679
Scott: you're gonna play a lot less terrorist rounds, right because the game is gonna end sometime there.

531
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,360
Scott: So you're not really playing an even number of rounds on both sides.

532
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:51,340
Scott: But it you know, if you won half the rounds the first half you then you are gonna play a full number.

533
00:34:51,862 --> 00:34:53,748
Rym: So you only don't play an even number.

534
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:56,580
Rym: if you just kick the shit out of the other team.

535
00:34:56,681 --> 00:34:57,975
Scott: Oh the other team kicks the shit out of you.

536
00:34:58,056 --> 00:34:58,400
Scott: Exactly.

537
00:34:58,761 --> 00:35:05,940
Rym: But now this is the point Scott's getting at by making all these things the default for just dudes Who've never played counter-strike before.

538
00:35:06,801 --> 00:35:07,946
Rym: Remember we did that panel.

539
00:35:07,986 --> 00:35:09,111
Rym: the game makes the community.

540
00:35:09,814 --> 00:35:11,060
Rym: What's counter-strike known for?

541
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,269
Rym: Pretty bad before the Xbox appeared.

542
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,879
Rym: before, you know, halo with voice chat.

543
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:22,539
Rym: Counter-strike was like the benchmark for shitty online community play.

544
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:23,607
Scott: now It's not even close.

545
00:35:23,687 --> 00:35:25,260
Scott: every other game is way worse.

546
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:30,474
Scott: The counter-strikes community is great compared to the communities of almost every game except NS.

547
00:35:30,675 --> 00:35:38,120
Rym: by making all this the default There's this sort of top-down culture of taking the game seriously playing competitively.

548
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:40,162
Scott: Yeah It's like it used to be Counter.

549
00:35:40,183 --> 00:35:43,020
Scott: people play counter-strike and they just be trying to get the most kills or whatever.

550
00:35:43,462 --> 00:35:51,160
Scott: Now if you are playing on one of those servers that you found not, you know Sure, if you go click community server and find some modded up server who knows what's gonna happen there?

551
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:58,060
Scott: But if you click find game counter-strike competitive the odds are you're gonna not have griefers.

552
00:35:58,422 --> 00:35:58,884
Scott: It's gonna be.

553
00:35:59,105 --> 00:36:04,646
Rym: people are gonna be trying to run into such Horrid griefing problems.

554
00:36:04,767 --> 00:36:09,380
Scott: I have not run into any griefing personally and you know people I've played with.

555
00:36:09,561 --> 00:36:11,307
Scott: Everyone tries to win the game.

556
00:36:11,327 --> 00:36:14,840
Scott: They don't necessarily always try to win by bomb but or by rescue.

557
00:36:15,302 --> 00:36:17,610
Scott: But there's a lot of bombing and a lot of rescuing.

558
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:21,339
Scott: whereas before people just wouldn't even give a shit who had the bomb I just be let's kill each other.

559
00:36:21,614 --> 00:36:31,640
Rym: Yeah Now the thing is I never had those problems in source and one six because I played on very heavily modded You know heavily like admin queue at like awesome servers with clan people running them.

560
00:36:32,144 --> 00:36:34,020
Rym: So I had people like managing all this stuff.

561
00:36:35,201 --> 00:36:45,698
Rym: That's kind of the default experience for everyone's like everyone gets to experience what clan play is like to a big degree Yep, and that I think is gonna really push counter-strike culture in a different direction.

562
00:36:45,738 --> 00:36:51,560
Scott: something else I really like about the new counter-strike if someone well, yeah music we can talk about I want to talk about the.

563
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,675
Scott: When someone drops out there's a bot.

564
00:36:54,735 --> 00:36:57,468
Scott: that is you know There's bots to take over the bot.

565
00:36:57,629 --> 00:36:58,513
Scott: take over the bot.

566
00:36:58,593 --> 00:37:02,391
Scott: as the first time that happened to me I was like, oh my god, what a great idea, right?

567
00:37:02,472 --> 00:37:05,747
Scott: It's like, of course, I'm dead But we have a bot on our team.

568
00:37:06,188 --> 00:37:09,160
Scott: Obviously I want I can take over for the bot and I can be him.

569
00:37:09,509 --> 00:37:16,384
Rym: Oh my god I was on a server where we was a really close match and it was like four good people on my team and then one No, which is fine.

570
00:37:16,847 --> 00:37:19,380
Rym: He was like we're all voice chatting and he was like what I do.

571
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,035
Rym: We're like you follow this guy, but follow the bomb guy.

572
00:37:22,076 --> 00:37:22,800
Rym: and he was trying.

573
00:37:23,422 --> 00:37:29,900
Rym: So we're sitting there and there's one guy left and it's the bot and the bot is guarding the planted bomb.

574
00:37:30,502 --> 00:37:42,620
Rym: So the noob out of nowhere says over the bus says and I quote press e to take over and everyone in the team was like no And he hits e and then he's just standing there and then he dies and then they diffuse the bomb, right?

575
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,647
Rym: I almost cried.

576
00:37:43,667 --> 00:37:45,100
Scott: I want to tell you about the time though.

577
00:37:45,181 --> 00:37:51,613
Scott: The first time I took over a bot was really uneventful Like nothing happened because the match just sort of ended and I didn't see anybody.

578
00:37:51,653 --> 00:37:56,449
Scott: but the second time I took over a bot I can't basically think no one.

579
00:37:56,529 --> 00:37:59,120
Scott: I was like I took over and this bot was like in the middle of nowhere.

580
00:37:59,662 --> 00:38:04,220
Scott: But like the hostages needed rescuing and I had no idea was go, you know where the other team was or anything.

581
00:38:04,742 --> 00:38:06,107
Scott: So I'm just like, alright, let's go.

582
00:38:06,127 --> 00:38:07,813
Scott: the bot had a deagle.

583
00:38:07,833 --> 00:38:09,058
Scott: I went over.

584
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:09,620
Scott: it was in Italy.

585
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:15,620
Scott: I go into the house, right and I'm looking around the house and there's you know, there's nothing going on.

586
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,971
Scott: I grabbed the hot some hostages and I walk out of the house.

587
00:38:18,454 --> 00:38:24,414
Scott: when I walk out of the house I realized the guy was climbing up the crates to go in the top window.

588
00:38:24,575 --> 00:38:26,260
Scott: as I was leaving through the bottom door.

589
00:38:26,842 --> 00:38:28,990
Scott: I just turned to the right and a boom one shot.

590
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:34,191
Scott: as the bot took him out turned to left Right to start running with the hostages and there's a dude.

591
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:36,240
Scott: that dude is just at the end of the tunnel.

592
00:38:36,461 --> 00:38:37,223
Scott: He comes around.

593
00:38:37,263 --> 00:38:40,535
Scott: I just appeared at the end of the tunnel as soon as I started running down the tunnel.

594
00:38:40,956 --> 00:38:42,944
Scott: Boom one shot Taking over.

595
00:38:42,984 --> 00:38:45,916
Scott: thing is I'm like pissed because those kills don't count for me.

596
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:46,680
Scott: They count for the bot.

597
00:38:46,881 --> 00:38:50,017
Scott: Yeah, I'm like no I did it but I died that round.

598
00:38:50,037 --> 00:38:53,097
Rym: so I don't really deserve my most glorious moment so far in Counter-Strike.

599
00:38:53,137 --> 00:38:55,004
Rym: go is So.

600
00:38:55,084 --> 00:38:56,413
Rym: it was demolition not demolition.

601
00:38:56,433 --> 00:39:01,772
Rym: it was a gun game and I was golden knife and there was one other guy who's never.

602
00:39:01,812 --> 00:39:03,820
Scott: so I gotta tell you I suck so bad a gun game.

603
00:39:03,901 --> 00:39:04,850
Scott: I'm never golden knife.

604
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,023
Rym: I'm golden knife 90%.

605
00:39:07,023 --> 00:39:09,334
Scott: I have not golden knife, but I don't.

606
00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:10,740
Rym: I've only let alone one.

607
00:39:10,921 --> 00:39:15,720
Scott: I've only won one gun game so far one zero gun games and I've never even golden knife.

608
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:22,183
Rym: It is so rare that I am NOT golden knife when someone else wins and usually I'm knifed to death by one of the other Golden knives.

609
00:39:22,384 --> 00:39:23,890
Scott: I'm I've never golden knife.

610
00:39:23,931 --> 00:39:32,739
Rym: So my most glorious moment yet I was in that a baggage handling map and I jumped onto that ledge and I see the golden knife guy run by.

611
00:39:32,759 --> 00:39:36,714
Rym: I Jumped down on top of him and golden knifed him to death from the air.

612
00:39:36,734 --> 00:39:45,814
Scott: There's something about that map I just suck so bad at because even though I've never won gun game or you know arms race When I'm on the sort of jungle map, right?

613
00:39:46,035 --> 00:39:46,980
Scott: I'm doing pretty well.

614
00:39:47,101 --> 00:39:49,334
Scott: I'm like, you know getting to pistols and stuff.

615
00:39:49,374 --> 00:39:52,408
Rym: I spawn camp the back I just hide and then I kill everyone.

616
00:39:52,428 --> 00:39:55,480
Scott: I spawn as soon on that stupid baggage handling map.

617
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:59,279
Scott: I can't even get past the stupid fucking shotguns half the time run.

618
00:39:59,581 --> 00:40:02,010
Rym: Just run down the ramp and up the other ramp and shoot anyone.

619
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,495
Rym: you see the shotguns are just.

620
00:40:03,696 --> 00:40:04,559
Scott: I can't hit anybody.

621
00:40:05,022 --> 00:40:07,137
Rym: You got to run down the ramp or they can't dodge you.

622
00:40:08,125 --> 00:40:08,831
Scott: I'm so bad.

623
00:40:09,052 --> 00:40:09,799
Scott: That's a stupid man.

624
00:40:10,923 --> 00:40:15,205
Rym: No, I'm seriously golden gun like every round Golden knife anyway.

625
00:40:15,305 --> 00:40:18,936
Rym: Yeah, all the other weird mods of counter-strike do not exist yet.

626
00:40:19,257 --> 00:40:20,100
Rym: Yeah, which is problem?

627
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,659
Scott: I think there's a zombie mod that someone's already poured it over.

628
00:40:22,699 --> 00:40:22,860
Scott: whatever.

629
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:28,799
Rym: We should do a separate show on how come there's this culture in PC games of these people who want to play zombies.

630
00:40:28,919 --> 00:40:32,140
Scott: this dude I got this game for you called left for dead - no, here's the part of it.

631
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,103
Rym: It's not just zombies.

632
00:40:33,123 --> 00:40:35,911
Rym: people make these god-awful like the world.

633
00:40:35,952 --> 00:40:44,031
Rym: the Warcraft 3 mod for counter-strike 1 6 these god-awful garbage unbalanced like non analogous mods.

634
00:40:44,492 --> 00:40:51,833
Rym: and there's like Maps the worst tech like who plays these games.

635
00:40:51,853 --> 00:40:53,680
Scott: I actually kind of really like bad maps.

636
00:40:53,781 --> 00:40:54,586
Scott: I want counter-strike.

637
00:40:54,606 --> 00:40:56,760
Scott: go icy world real bad the icy world.

638
00:40:57,062 --> 00:41:03,474
Rym: I could make a great argument that it is actually a great map I'm talking about like crack house or pool.

639
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:09,333
Rym: those maps in stock Actually played a lot of gun game in that man.

640
00:41:09,453 --> 00:41:09,896
Scott: I hate that.

641
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:15,350
Scott: I actually kind of like the gun game Lego II map with the upstairs and downstairs.

642
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:20,247
Scott: That one's okay, but their mods of it is like it comes into all different very always like scouts and knives.

643
00:41:20,328 --> 00:41:25,864
Scott: No gravity I actually like the crazy orange Gun game map from counters like source.

644
00:41:26,206 --> 00:41:26,850
Rym: No, you know what?

645
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:29,518
Rym: Here's the only problem with counter-strike go.

646
00:41:29,558 --> 00:41:35,557
Rym: the only bad thing I have to say about it right now There's a. there's only a small set of maps.

647
00:41:35,778 --> 00:41:37,222
Rym: So there's no militia yet.

648
00:41:37,724 --> 00:41:42,800
Scott: I also don't like how you have to choose Demolition or hostage mission.

649
00:41:42,861 --> 00:41:44,087
Scott: It's like I want to sort of mix it up.

650
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:45,333
Rym: guys You know that.

651
00:41:45,373 --> 00:41:49,230
Rym: you see if you want to choose for real you join a server that has a rotation you like.

652
00:41:50,031 --> 00:41:50,834
Scott: Then I gotta find.

653
00:41:50,854 --> 00:41:53,703
Scott: I gotta like search for like SV pure and stuff like that.

654
00:41:53,743 --> 00:41:55,810
Rym: No, you've just got to know a good clan.

655
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:57,421
Scott: I gotta start a service.

656
00:41:57,441 --> 00:41:57,924
Scott: I'm gonna do.

657
00:41:57,984 --> 00:41:58,588
Rym: that's what we're gonna do.

658
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:04,704
Rym: Yeah The thing is I like my anarchy death clan dudes and I feel like I want to play with them more than I want to play with you guys.

659
00:42:04,925 --> 00:42:10,350
Scott: anyway, I'm gonna go and Let's go down the list of the other things that are new and kind of okay.

660
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:21,065
Rym: So the crosshair is somewhat contentious but I found a pretty big survey and a counter-strike forum and it seems like about it's about 60/40 like hate of the new crosshair the default one.

661
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:22,815
Rym: I Think it's great.

662
00:42:23,016 --> 00:42:25,810
Rym: And I think anyone who says otherwise doesn't understand it and is stupid.

663
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:32,722
Scott: Yeah, I mean it had you know, the old counter-strike crosshair would spread out showing you that your you know Weapon spread is you know getting wider.

664
00:42:32,743 --> 00:42:33,850
Rym: and this one does too.

665
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:41,678
Rym: But you realize guys it has two different spreads and it shows a ton of information If you pay attention to it, right it shows you.

666
00:42:41,698 --> 00:42:44,750
Scott: basically the spreads at different ranges is what it's telling you.

667
00:42:44,951 --> 00:42:45,715
Scott: It's also.

668
00:42:45,775 --> 00:42:48,890
Scott: it's a lot like the grenade launcher in NS one.

669
00:42:49,151 --> 00:42:59,270
Rym: It's also showing you the difference between running walking and what the difference will be if you stop running to start walking And it turns into that X if you're aiming at a friend.

670
00:42:59,511 --> 00:43:00,754
Scott: that is the best part.

671
00:43:00,794 --> 00:43:10,585
Scott: is the X aiming at a friend especially when you're aiming at something because when you have a high-resolution screen and Basically a black dot through some smoke and you you're aiming through the smoke.

672
00:43:10,605 --> 00:43:15,603
Scott: You'll get the X like hey don't shoot That's your friend which is important on the competitive friendly fire server.

673
00:43:16,145 --> 00:43:25,708
Rym: now along those lines That crosshair is very important because the biggest most important change is that you don't pick You know Arctic or whatever.

674
00:43:26,371 --> 00:43:32,310
Rym: You just get a model and the models for the characters are thematically set to match the map.

675
00:43:32,671 --> 00:43:36,263
Rym: Yep, so when you're on he forgers to style banter and everything.

676
00:43:36,283 --> 00:43:38,410
Rym: This is how we will get our freedom.

677
00:43:39,072 --> 00:43:41,519
Scott: Yep, so it's like the revolutionaries on this map.

678
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,830
Scott: or you know the the sort of urban terrorists on that man.

679
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:46,295
Rym: This remove the GI GN.

680
00:43:46,355 --> 00:43:48,382
Scott: Have you noticed that on the Italy map?

681
00:43:48,883 --> 00:43:50,629
Scott: It's the GI GN which makes no sense.

682
00:43:51,131 --> 00:43:51,513
Rym: It depends.

683
00:43:51,573 --> 00:43:52,717
Rym: it could be a foreign force.

684
00:43:52,757 --> 00:43:54,384
Scott: The GI GN do not belong in Italy.

685
00:43:54,404 --> 00:43:56,050
Scott: They should have some Italian.

686
00:43:56,231 --> 00:43:57,254
Scott: It's a foreign force.

687
00:43:58,077 --> 00:44:00,706
Scott: I think there'd be an international incident if the GI GN went to Italy.

688
00:44:01,128 --> 00:44:04,236
Rym: Uh, probably We're already remember counter-strike.

689
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:06,343
Rym: I read this interview a long time ago.

690
00:44:06,383 --> 00:44:18,650
Rym: I'm paraphrasing based on my memory of 2001. ish Someone's saying that counter-strike or it was designed to begin the game the moment when negotiations broke down.

691
00:44:19,351 --> 00:44:21,155
Rym: The game is literally between.

692
00:44:21,196 --> 00:44:27,470
Rym: when negotiations break down and either all the terrorists are dead or the terrorists or the hostages are rescued.

693
00:44:28,871 --> 00:44:31,603
Scott: Other realize that the problem is in the real world.

694
00:44:31,664 --> 00:44:36,179
Scott: if counter-terrorists lose More counter-terrorists show up and the terrorists are still.

695
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:42,158
Rym: well because the terrorists got their objective which was Blow up the arms depot, right?

696
00:44:42,199 --> 00:44:44,547
Scott: But then the terrorists are escaping and now you're chasing them.

697
00:44:44,567 --> 00:44:45,290
Scott: That's a different game.

698
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:47,097
Scott: What if it's a rescue the hostage mission though?

699
00:44:47,518 --> 00:45:04,559
Rym: So maybe if you don't rescue the hostages then the diplomatic instant happens Because you realize it's like the Iran affair or that Russian thing where if you send the Counter-terrorists to actually rescue the hostages and you fuck up Sending the next round is usually not what happens instead.

700
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:08,550
Rym: There's political involvement and internationally terrorists are still there with their hostages.

701
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:09,452
Scott: They got to do something.

702
00:45:09,793 --> 00:45:10,976
Rym: Yeah, but that's a different game.

703
00:45:10,996 --> 00:45:16,700
Rym: Okay, this game is just when the president says send them in All right.

704
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:19,610
Scott: What else has changed in this new version?

705
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:26,350
Rym: So the models changing removes one minor element that I used to like which was using Arctic guy in the desert.

706
00:45:26,511 --> 00:45:33,410
Rym: I used Arctic in every map because when I killed a motherfucker I wanted him to remember it was me and that I didn't even need the camouflage.

707
00:45:33,711 --> 00:45:38,950
Rym: I'm this standout white ass dude in the middle of the desert with the deagle and I still killed you.

708
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:41,419
Scott: I picked whichever guy I felt like on counter-terrorists.

709
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,130
Scott: I always pick GIGN no matter what I was Arctic all the time.

710
00:45:44,572 --> 00:45:48,430
Scott: On terrorist I chose either Phoenix Connection or nerdy glasses guy.

711
00:45:49,072 --> 00:45:52,082
Scott: I only chose Arctic if it was snowing and that was even sometimes.

712
00:45:52,122 --> 00:45:52,764
Scott: I didn't do that.

713
00:45:53,126 --> 00:45:58,065
Scott: and the fourth terrorist guy I never picked ever but the the bandana guy never.

714
00:45:58,205 --> 00:46:03,245
Rym: now there is no meta advantage of choosing one over the other because they're set to the map.

715
00:46:03,305 --> 00:46:15,990
Rym: but - By having it themed like this coupled with the music which I think is very artfully done It'd be very very easy to ruin counter-strike by adding music and making it more Call of Duty ish or some other.

716
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:18,750
Scott: I think the music is very NS ish, right?

717
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:24,365
Rym: Yes, because it tells you what's going on in a very subtle way like bomb gets planted suddenly.

718
00:46:24,405 --> 00:46:29,343
Scott: There's the music of uh-oh Yeah, it's not like it's a song playing while you're playing the game.

719
00:46:29,423 --> 00:46:31,270
Rym: It's like that Hans Zimmer style.

720
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:31,692
Rym: Yeah, it's.

721
00:46:31,733 --> 00:46:34,830
Scott: the music is action movie music letting you know what's going on.

722
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:40,147
Scott: It brings more of that old action quake natural selection into the counter-strike sort.

723
00:46:40,168 --> 00:46:40,208
Scott: of.

724
00:46:40,549 --> 00:46:53,370
Scott: you know It's if you think it would be unpure because it wasn't in the ever in counter-strike, but actually it's bring it's coming it's it's a it's sort of a What's it called the genetic thing where suddenly your kid has red hair?

725
00:46:55,911 --> 00:47:02,030
Scott: The recessive gene of the action quake has reemerged and the counter-strike go but this is expressing itself.

726
00:47:02,231 --> 00:47:10,778
Rym: So the immersion the banter the themed character models and the music together Basically make counter-strike go.

727
00:47:10,798 --> 00:47:16,577
Rym: a perfect fusion of 1/6 in source in that Plus an upgrade of modern technology.

728
00:47:16,617 --> 00:47:17,820
Rym: It was not immersive.

729
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:18,964
Rym: 1/6 was a sport.

730
00:47:19,204 --> 00:47:21,210
Rym: It was it was not immersive.

731
00:47:21,392 --> 00:47:23,088
Rym: It is, it exists, it still is.

732
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:26,582
Rym: Yes, I did not in any way think of it as an immersive.

733
00:47:26,622 --> 00:47:28,187
Rym: like I am this counter-terrorist.

734
00:47:28,228 --> 00:47:28,930
Rym: I was not involved.

735
00:47:29,011 --> 00:47:30,079
Scott: I still don't think that.

736
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:34,680
Rym: but but playing the game I am much more immersed in the in the game world.

737
00:47:34,981 --> 00:47:37,488
Rym: because of all these elements which source did better?

738
00:47:37,569 --> 00:47:41,967
Rym: because it was Technologically better, but source was less of a sport.

739
00:47:42,308 --> 00:47:46,785
Rym: for reasons I don't want to get into because we're not talking about that if you disagree with me.

740
00:47:46,865 --> 00:47:51,529
Rym: I'll simply say that right now Counter-strike go because it just went live is the number one game.

741
00:47:52,111 --> 00:48:01,543
Rym: Counter-strike 1/6 has been consistently more popular than counter-strike source Forever yeah, and counter-strikes basically once go came out.

742
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:03,490
Rym: source lost a ton of players.

743
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:05,343
Rym: 1/6 didn't lose any.

744
00:48:05,545 --> 00:48:10,190
Scott: yep The let's talk about the fire right the molotovs and the incendio grenades.

745
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:13,030
Rym: I use those as area denial highly effectively.

746
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:16,739
Scott: That's pretty much all they do is area denial But they are awesome.

747
00:48:16,759 --> 00:48:23,990
Scott: because what I tend to do is you know It's that one thing you really need in counter-strike is you go down a hallway and you can go right or you can go left.

748
00:48:24,352 --> 00:48:25,279
Scott: But you're so worried.

749
00:48:25,481 --> 00:48:26,347
Scott: What if I go left?

750
00:48:26,408 --> 00:48:28,598
Scott: I'm Turning my back to the right.

751
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:30,006
Scott: a bad guy could appear it.

752
00:48:30,026 --> 00:48:30,830
Rym: I still will appears.

753
00:48:31,631 --> 00:48:32,838
Rym: Run through fire.

754
00:48:32,918 --> 00:48:37,202
Rym: I ignore he grenades because Grenades you can ignore in a clan match.

755
00:48:37,242 --> 00:48:38,650
Rym: that doesn't work, but against puppies.

756
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:41,050
Rym: Yeah They don't expect me to come through the flame.

757
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:48,096
Scott: But now right when I turn left I can throw the flame to the right and feel a little bit safer About doing that.

758
00:48:48,136 --> 00:48:56,270
Scott: whereas before it was you just had to sort of Slowly turn back and forth real quick until you got around the corner to make sure nobody was good.

759
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:58,460
Rym: You know where I use it the most on Aztec.

760
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:06,050
Rym: rather than sniping the the bridge I'll just wait at the bridge for like 20 seconds, and then I'll just flame the edge of the bridge.

761
00:49:06,334 --> 00:49:08,073
Scott: You know what I remember I still do.

762
00:49:08,274 --> 00:49:13,130
Scott: I still play on Aztec my old strategy secret staircase secret staircase down.

763
00:49:13,431 --> 00:49:20,179
Scott: Throw the grenade from below the bridge up into the other side Distracting those guys so that my snipers win the bridge.

764
00:49:20,439 --> 00:49:22,304
Scott: then go up the other secret staircase.

765
00:49:22,665 --> 00:49:27,325
Scott: a first time Aztec loaded when I played CSGO I did my secret staircase cuz I'm like.

766
00:49:27,346 --> 00:49:28,009
Scott: is it still there.

767
00:49:28,351 --> 00:49:29,135
Scott: It's still there.

768
00:49:29,195 --> 00:49:32,110
Rym: bitches not like one Kuwait for you get there, and it's not there anymore.

769
00:49:32,211 --> 00:49:34,610
Scott: I popped up on the other end of the secret staircase.

770
00:49:35,152 --> 00:49:39,110
Scott: The whole other team was there not even looking at the secret staircase.

771
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:42,150
Scott: They were all looking down the hallway or into the room.

772
00:49:42,511 --> 00:49:46,528
Scott: I shot one dude in the back started shooting another guy, and then I died, but that's how it goes.

773
00:49:46,649 --> 00:49:48,599
Rym: really You should have headshot it because it doesn't much better.

774
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:50,509
Scott: How was I supposed to headshot for dudes?

775
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:52,155
Rym: Before click.

776
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:55,330
Scott: after I killed the first dude they started looking at me.

777
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:55,893
Scott: I'm lucky.

778
00:49:55,954 --> 00:49:58,228
Scott: I managed to even hurt a second dude.

779
00:49:58,248 --> 00:49:58,429
Scott: Scott.

780
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:00,376
Rym: It would take two seconds to click on forehead.

781
00:50:00,417 --> 00:50:02,364
Scott: They weren't all together in one lump.

782
00:50:02,404 --> 00:50:03,648
Scott: They were all you know.

783
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:07,090
Rym: yeah Yeah, this is why we're not a team players.

784
00:50:07,552 --> 00:50:09,884
Rym: We're not top tier counter-strike, and I had a p90.

785
00:50:09,904 --> 00:50:10,306
Scott: it wasn't like.

786
00:50:10,367 --> 00:50:10,990
Scott: I was right on top.

787
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:12,761
Scott: You know I wasn't that close they were.

788
00:50:13,626 --> 00:50:14,189
Rym: so the guns.

789
00:50:15,371 --> 00:50:25,978
Scott: right now the shotguns are Slightly opie, and I you think the shotguns are opie, so yes, I think the shotguns suck Are you kidding?

790
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:34,150
Scott: I can't hit shit with Unless you're really close, which I guess was shotgun supposed to do, but I think especially that stupid sawed-off one.

791
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:35,415
Scott: Oh fuck that are you kidding?

792
00:50:35,436 --> 00:50:36,781
Rym: that thing is the one of the best gun.

793
00:50:36,922 --> 00:50:38,770
Scott: it can only hit the broadside of a barn.

794
00:50:38,991 --> 00:50:41,961
Rym: Yeah, you know how much damage that does from a surprising distance.

795
00:50:42,483 --> 00:50:43,506
Scott: I can't hit anybody with.

796
00:50:43,887 --> 00:50:44,630
Rym: maybe you just suck.

797
00:50:45,416 --> 00:50:47,190
Rym: I have not played on the same server as you yet.

798
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:49,130
Rym: I think we need to do some versus gun game.

799
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:55,870
Scott: I did not hit anybody with the soup and when I play gun game it used to be when I played gun game in the original old gun game.

800
00:50:56,111 --> 00:50:57,217
Scott: You know I would.

801
00:50:57,418 --> 00:50:59,930
Scott: it would start off with the AWP and I'd be like fuck.

802
00:51:00,691 --> 00:51:04,690
Scott: And I would basically until I as soon as I got past the AWP then I'd be on a roll.

803
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,890
Scott: I start killing everybody right, but it took me like one or two rounds.

804
00:51:08,051 --> 00:51:18,835
Scott: I always be behind and those one or two times when I got a kill with the sniper rifle right away I'd be set cuz then I'd buy my way past the stupid scout And I'd you know I'd get right through to the end unless you get knifed.

805
00:51:19,316 --> 00:51:36,761
Scott: unless I got knifed which happens sometimes in The new gun game you don't start off with a sniper rifle you start off with like what this Like the mp5 or something right, so I'm like hey, and I get right into it You know, but then when I get to the shotguns I'm just like oh, I can't fucking kill anyone.

806
00:51:36,842 --> 00:51:39,270
Rym: with the way this is I can't get close enough to anyone.

807
00:51:39,772 --> 00:51:52,630
Rym: I am the best in any game in terms of just my kill ratios with submachine guns and shotties Rather than the rest with submachine guns and assault rifles because the SMGs have a very low spread even when running.

808
00:51:52,791 --> 00:51:55,850
Rym: Yeah, and there's that new SMG that doesn't slow you down at all.

809
00:51:56,830 --> 00:51:58,781
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't do a lot of damage.

810
00:51:58,801 --> 00:51:59,585
Scott: That doesn't matter.

811
00:51:59,625 --> 00:52:03,942
Scott: headshots, baby Yeah, I mean the thing yeah usually a headshot with it, but it's still.

812
00:52:04,082 --> 00:52:05,166
Scott: I prefer p90 and mp5.

813
00:52:06,371 --> 00:52:08,685
Scott: Those are my guns and AK and m4.

814
00:52:08,705 --> 00:52:08,987
Scott: I mean m4.

815
00:52:09,812 --> 00:52:14,030
Scott: I mean the game even sort of tells you that the m4 is the best gun.

816
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:26,661
Scott: There's these little hints when you're waiting for stuff to load and one of the hints are is like yeah The m4 is great at medium range and with practice It's great at long and short range too, and it's like so.

817
00:52:26,741 --> 00:52:29,970
Scott: basically the m4 is the best which I already knew.

818
00:52:31,012 --> 00:52:32,218
Rym: They ruined counter-strike though.

819
00:52:32,238 --> 00:52:33,505
Rym: There's no silencer on the m4.

820
00:52:33,706 --> 00:52:35,374
Scott: Yeah, I Are you kidding?

821
00:52:35,435 --> 00:52:38,950
Scott: I know I got the m4 and I pushed secondary attack and nothing happened.

822
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:44,401
Rym: So I got the m4 and I pushed secondary attack and when it didn't happen I thought oh this must not be the m4.

823
00:52:44,421 --> 00:52:45,386
Rym: It must be some other gun.

824
00:52:45,426 --> 00:52:46,270
Rym: and I just didn't notice.

825
00:52:47,271 --> 00:52:48,600
Scott: Models did change a little bit.

826
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,110
Scott: So like the mp5 looks different.

827
00:52:50,291 --> 00:52:50,832
Rym: Is it just me?

828
00:52:50,893 --> 00:52:54,545
Rym: or the models actually look kind of shitty and like low res.

829
00:52:54,565 --> 00:52:55,950
Scott: they don't look shitty and low res.

830
00:52:56,231 --> 00:52:58,180
Scott: It's just that the low polygon count.

831
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,873
Scott: like they look cheap not for me But what they?

832
00:53:01,075 --> 00:53:03,370
Scott: the thing that bothers me about them is they don't look the same.

833
00:53:03,892 --> 00:53:07,163
Scott: So it's like I can't tell I have the mp5 because it doesn't look the way.

834
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:10,470
Scott: the mp5 looked in old counter-strike Because you see less of the gun.

835
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:11,392
Rym: I yeah You don't.

836
00:53:11,413 --> 00:53:11,795
Scott: you don't see.

837
00:53:11,815 --> 00:53:15,715
Scott: you see like the top of it more than the side Because it's you don't get that.

838
00:53:15,835 --> 00:53:18,124
Scott: it's more like it's closer to doom than the sort of.

839
00:53:18,204 --> 00:53:19,870
Rym: so you haven't talked about the decoy grenade.

840
00:53:19,991 --> 00:53:22,384
Rym: But I think it's because based on our conversation earlier.

841
00:53:22,424 --> 00:53:23,370
Rym: You didn't know what it did.

842
00:53:23,572 --> 00:53:24,380
Scott: I didn't know what it did.

843
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:25,350
Scott: I didn't really experiment.

844
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,413
Rym: So here's what it does.

845
00:53:27,095 --> 00:53:33,559
Rym: if you throw it it makes sounds like whatever gun you have For a while.

846
00:53:33,579 --> 00:53:34,889
Scott: So now here's the thing.

847
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:38,680
Scott: It's uh, oh it sounds like whatever gun you have.

848
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:40,868
Scott: yes, I thought it always sounded like assault rifle.

849
00:53:40,948 --> 00:53:44,930
Scott: No Because I was like, you know this shows how much I didn't know.

850
00:53:45,051 --> 00:53:45,455
Scott: I was like.

851
00:53:45,496 --> 00:53:49,060
Scott: if someone throws one in round one It sounds like a star rifle in train.

852
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:50,909
Rym: when I'm CT when we're not terrorists, right?

853
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:55,450
Rym: I'll run way past the dumpster that long haul where there's the big ambush that always happens.

854
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:58,886
Rym: Yeah by myself the whole rest of the team rushes some other way.

855
00:53:58,906 --> 00:53:59,590
Rym: I don't care which way they go.

856
00:54:00,192 --> 00:54:07,554
Rym: I throw smoke fire decoy and then I throw all the grenades smoke fire decoy And I also shoot.

857
00:54:07,976 --> 00:54:12,790
Rym: so if the counter-terrorists went that way they think we rush that way and they come back to fight.

858
00:54:13,892 --> 00:54:15,360
Rym: You'd think they'd figure it out.

859
00:54:15,782 --> 00:54:17,029
Rym: They've never figured it out.

860
00:54:18,532 --> 00:54:21,969
Scott: You can have one person completely fake a rush using all the grenades.

861
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:28,349
Rym: now the trouble with the decoy is that Prince of Nothing style the numb finger doesn't feel the barbs.

862
00:54:28,369 --> 00:54:31,709
Rym: a Decoy doesn't do anything against a nub.

863
00:54:32,847 --> 00:54:38,070
Rym: I Throw a decoy around like I threw a decoy and I'm running away and to see a nub just kind of walk around the corner.

864
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:39,175
Rym: It's like right toward it.

865
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:39,979
Scott: It's like dude.

866
00:54:39,999 --> 00:54:41,325
Scott: Didn't you hear this gunfire?

867
00:54:41,365 --> 00:54:42,490
Scott: Why would you go there granted?

868
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:44,542
Rym: I just turned around and shot him anyway, cuz he's a nub.

869
00:54:44,562 --> 00:54:45,085
Rym: He didn't know.

870
00:54:45,145 --> 00:54:50,385
Rym: but yeah, oh My god, I love counter-strike the other thing in this game right?

871
00:54:50,425 --> 00:54:51,290
Rym: other other other thing.

872
00:54:51,571 --> 00:54:53,116
Scott: Yeah, I mean well, there's a million other things.

873
00:54:53,136 --> 00:55:01,081
Scott: the thing is suffice it to say because it's a new counter-strike I really want to shoot people and practice shooting people.

874
00:55:01,863 --> 00:55:06,495
Scott: So I will often against my best interests Go to somewhere.

875
00:55:06,515 --> 00:55:08,122
Scott: I'm gonna get shot and die.

876
00:55:08,142 --> 00:55:22,870
Rym: I will also just because it's more boy It's more exciting than hanging around with the hostages Because they're hanging around with the bomb because there's so many nubs I rush Because I don't get to do that when I normally play counters, right?

877
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:24,660
Scott: So I've been doing a lot of stupid shit.

878
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:28,721
Scott: just because I want to get into a gunfight Even when the gunfight is not the place.

879
00:55:28,781 --> 00:55:29,706
Rym: I got any dust.

880
00:55:29,786 --> 00:55:30,550
Rym: like regular dust.

881
00:55:30,771 --> 00:55:34,248
Rym: I'll just fucking run out into the middle with like a pea 90.

882
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:36,094
Scott: I'm right I played dust.

883
00:55:36,234 --> 00:55:39,664
Scott: I played regular dust twice right both times.

884
00:55:40,085 --> 00:55:44,178
Scott: I just rushed bombsite a 100% and no one was ever there.

885
00:55:44,721 --> 00:55:46,790
Scott: Everyone was like messing around with the tunnel.

886
00:55:47,991 --> 00:55:53,010
Rym: I'll run into the apartments and then I'll like hang back or like duck into the sniper room and like set up an ambush.

887
00:55:53,371 --> 00:55:58,267
Rym: I'll wait maybe five seconds for I give up and just keep rushing because no one's gonna come no one goes.

888
00:55:58,328 --> 00:56:01,560
Scott: bombsite a. You could just go there put the bomb away.

889
00:56:01,921 --> 00:56:04,109
Scott: And it's like we went a like ten times in a row.

890
00:56:04,672 --> 00:56:10,760
Scott: Nobody came there until after he planted the bomb and then as soon as they came through those wooden doors I dig it dig it dig it again.

891
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:10,962
Scott: It does.

892
00:56:12,616 --> 00:56:13,228
Scott: I'm like guys.

893
00:56:13,711 --> 00:56:16,019
Scott: When are they gonna go to a here and meet us there?

894
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:19,070
Scott: and they never met us at a until after we planted the thing.

895
00:56:19,752 --> 00:56:28,398
Rym: After this rush of noobs, I think I'll do most of my play on either our own servers or The clan servers that I used to plan.

896
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:31,070
Rym: I got to figure out when the clans will have their servers.

897
00:56:31,432 --> 00:56:33,284
Scott: I think I just want to set up our own server.

898
00:56:33,304 --> 00:56:34,290
Scott: That is the way to go.

899
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:36,026
Rym: Is it gonna run gun game or what?

900
00:56:36,107 --> 00:56:37,398
Scott: Well, no I think what will run?

901
00:56:37,479 --> 00:56:42,409
Scott: normal counter-strike Reels and then since it's our server if we want to do a gun game we can do that.

902
00:56:42,793 --> 00:56:46,201
Scott: But I think most I think by default I mean I even kind of want to leave it public.

903
00:56:46,241 --> 00:56:48,857
Scott: so I'm thinking like by default We'll leave it as like public.

904
00:56:48,978 --> 00:56:50,970
Rym: We'll make it private when we do scheduled events.

905
00:56:51,139 --> 00:56:54,883
Scott: Yeah I think I'm thinking like public regular counter-strike when I'm like at work and shit.

906
00:56:55,184 --> 00:56:58,538
Scott: and then when we're playing we can take it Over you can make a private we can make a gun.

907
00:56:58,558 --> 00:57:03,115
Rym: Yeah, cuz what I want to do is I cuz I'm not I'm good at counter-strike.

908
00:57:03,236 --> 00:57:04,400
Rym: This is my game.

909
00:57:04,581 --> 00:57:07,150
Rym: I've been playing this game from almost day one.

910
00:57:07,231 --> 00:57:14,547
Scott: You know, that's the thing that really upsets me is like, okay I'm better than nubs, but I'm not great as you can, you know tell by not winning game.

911
00:57:14,607 --> 00:57:15,450
Rym: I'm a really good skier.

912
00:57:15,531 --> 00:57:16,590
Rym: I do double black diamonds.

913
00:57:16,751 --> 00:57:23,534
Rym: I'm really crazy all over the mountain and some 80 year old dude or some ten-year-old kid will just fly by me Thousand times better.

914
00:57:23,554 --> 00:57:35,635
Scott: No, but what upsets me is that I've been doing this shit since 12 years and some guy Who's been playing it for like a month will come and kick my ass like because that guy's been playing it for a month Straight.

915
00:57:35,938 --> 00:57:36,504
Scott: I've been playing.

916
00:57:36,524 --> 00:57:43,265
Scott: if you add Ten years Twelve years if you all my counter-strike playing together.

917
00:57:43,365 --> 00:57:44,209
Scott: It's at least six months.

918
00:57:44,971 --> 00:57:49,587
Rym: How much of a gap was there between when we kind of stopped playing source and recently?

919
00:57:49,687 --> 00:57:50,570
Scott: does it really matter?

920
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:53,981
Scott: I mean, yes, it does think about DDR.

921
00:57:54,082 --> 00:57:56,350
Rym: I didn't play DDR a lot for like a year and a half.

922
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:57,333
Rym: I started playing again.

923
00:57:57,373 --> 00:58:04,356
Rym: You know what I couldn't do the nine footers anymore without some practice When I started playing.

924
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:07,890
Scott: go again, well, I better go home and play counter-strike to get those skills back.

925
00:58:07,971 --> 00:58:09,830
Scott: Yeah, maybe I'll get the golden knife someday.

926
00:58:10,091 --> 00:58:15,772
Rym: I might at mag fest if they have the PC area set up go play some counter-strike I.

927
00:58:16,113 --> 00:58:17,839
Scott: that is one thing I am curious about.

928
00:58:17,879 --> 00:58:22,957
Scott: right and I've always been curious about this is I know that there are people Who are better than me right there.

929
00:58:22,997 --> 00:58:23,740
Scott: is that as a fact?

930
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,805
Rym: you want to know why they're better.

931
00:58:25,447 --> 00:58:26,030
Scott: They're just better.

932
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:26,596
Rym: I'm Scott.

933
00:58:26,636 --> 00:58:31,222
Rym: No, I Plan a lot of like curated passwordy clan servers, you know what.

934
00:58:31,764 --> 00:58:34,980
Rym: the people who are better, you know We talk about geeks versus nerds.

935
00:58:35,343 --> 00:58:37,713
Rym: They are all Counter-strike nerds.

936
00:58:38,054 --> 00:58:42,124
Rym: right that is their thing one, but there are also people who cheat.

937
00:58:42,706 --> 00:58:44,370
Scott: there are cheating people not that many.

938
00:58:44,571 --> 00:58:45,414
Scott: There are still some.

939
00:58:45,434 --> 00:58:48,064
Rym: it's hard to cheat in the modern era of counters.

940
00:58:48,084 --> 00:58:48,987
Scott: You'd be surprised.

941
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:49,409
Scott: They're there.

942
00:58:49,971 --> 00:58:51,198
Rym: What do you base that on?

943
00:58:51,399 --> 00:58:53,229
Scott: I'm just saying they're they're cheaters out there.

944
00:58:53,591 --> 00:58:59,730
Scott: Alright, I really want to because I never have play counter-strike in a closed environment.

945
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:01,959
Scott: This is the thing if I play counter-strike in a public ever.

946
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:05,737
Rym: I had that experience, you know land parties We don't go to that much.

947
00:59:05,858 --> 00:59:10,798
Rym: I used to when I was right for so Many years ago me and Scott Johnson.

948
00:59:11,259 --> 00:59:14,568
Rym: We're running some anime content for some con somewhere in Rochester.

949
00:59:14,629 --> 00:59:18,141
Rym: I think it was No, no, it was some other bigger better con.

950
00:59:18,282 --> 00:59:18,543
Rym: Okay.

951
00:59:18,804 --> 00:59:20,410
Rym: Well astronomical was the sci-fi con.

952
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:21,989
Rym: This was like an anime and gaming con.

953
00:59:22,732 --> 00:59:28,850
Rym: So it was like 11 o'clock at night midnight and we went over to the land and there was counter-strike.

954
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:34,129
Rym: So we're like, alright, so we sit down and the two of us Were just neo.

955
00:59:35,631 --> 00:59:37,582
Rym: We were accused of cheating.

956
00:59:37,602 --> 00:59:40,213
Rym: we killed Everyone.

957
00:59:40,313 --> 00:59:41,579
Rym: right we are our team.

958
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,990
Rym: just literally our entire team would die except Austin.

959
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:50,750
Rym: We would single-handedly kill everyone plant the bomb to the point that people were getting pissed off and looking around the room looking figure Who we were right?

960
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:53,810
Scott: So this is what I'm saying is I have only ever played counter-strike.

961
00:59:53,810 --> 01:00:03,370
Scott: 99% of my counter-strike play has been on a public server where there's someone who's way better than me or In a private server with only people I know in which case I'm sort of the best

962
01:00:03,651 --> 01:00:10,135
Rym: I've played on clan servers where it's everyone I know at least in the context of the game and I can spectate them They're not cheating.

963
01:00:10,155 --> 01:00:11,219
Rym: They're just that good.

964
01:00:11,922 --> 01:00:13,870
Scott: There are people I you know, they could be cheating.

965
01:00:13,971 --> 01:00:14,916
Rym: I know but I'm saying they're.

966
01:00:14,936 --> 01:00:17,290
Scott: they're generic sort of direct X level.

967
01:00:17,431 --> 01:00:19,825
Scott: I want to play at a LAN with people.

968
01:00:19,885 --> 01:00:20,650
Scott: I don't know.

969
01:00:22,211 --> 01:00:23,878
Rym: I've had your experience with people.

970
01:00:23,978 --> 01:00:25,303
Rym: I know are not cheating.

971
01:00:25,323 --> 01:00:26,809
Rym: There are people who are that good.

972
01:00:27,673 --> 01:00:28,938
Scott: What do they do that?

973
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,805
Scott: I haven't learned in 12 years.

974
01:00:30,885 --> 01:00:31,709
Scott: What do I do now?

975
01:00:32,451 --> 01:00:41,610
Rym: What we could have been that good and in fact We were close to being that good at RIT when we played counter-strike every day for multiple hours.

976
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:44,988
Rym: Yeah We don't do that anymore.

977
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:49,702
Scott: Also, we're older now, how am I supposed to win gun?

978
01:00:49,782 --> 01:00:51,730
Rym: he's got our bodies physically slow down.

979
01:00:52,232 --> 01:00:55,904
Rym: I have beaten max 300 and you know what?

980
01:00:55,924 --> 01:01:00,317
Rym: I think within a few more years I will not be physically capable of doing so again.

981
01:01:00,337 --> 01:01:02,002
Rym: I'm serious.

982
01:01:02,484 --> 01:01:04,670
Rym: I have slowed down as a human being.

983
01:01:04,992 --> 01:01:08,270
Scott: I did turn down my mouse sensitivity for this counter-strike and that helped a lot.

984
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:12,104
Rym: Oh Scott also steel series my like fancy mouse raw mode.

985
01:01:12,225 --> 01:01:13,670
Rym: It's it's it's great.

986
01:01:14,232 --> 01:01:15,937
Scott: Yeah, my mouse is also a gaming mouse.

987
01:01:16,237 --> 01:01:18,765
Scott: it's a logitech g5 whatever something something.

988
01:01:18,865 --> 01:01:20,409
Rym: this thing's got a screen on it.

989
01:01:20,952 --> 01:01:21,294
Scott: Okay.

990
01:01:21,454 --> 01:01:22,138
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

991
01:01:22,158 --> 01:01:22,741
Rym: It's pretty good.

992
01:01:22,781 --> 01:01:23,726
Scott: Mine is also pretty good.

993
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:24,550
Rym: I'm also wearing it out.

994
01:01:27,011 --> 01:01:29,150
Scott: Let's say this show is too long, ah, it's not too long.

995
01:01:29,170 --> 01:01:31,107
Rym: Well, yeah, it is too long because I'm gonna go play counter-strike.

996
01:01:31,127 --> 01:01:34,236
Rym: This is Suffice it to say counter-strike.

997
01:01:34,276 --> 01:01:36,704
Rym: go is the next evolution.

998
01:01:36,744 --> 01:01:37,306
Scott: It is the same.

999
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:38,270
Scott: It is counter-strike.

1000
01:01:38,893 --> 01:01:44,818
Scott: It's just modern for modern machines and modern Sensibility as I predicted and modern polish.

1001
01:01:44,899 --> 01:01:48,370
Rym: It did not affect the numbers of cs16, but it is decimating source.

1002
01:01:48,974 --> 01:01:56,477
Rym: I predict that as time goes on No one's gonna play counter-strike source except nut jobs and The majority of counter-strike players will be playing.

1003
01:01:56,538 --> 01:01:58,122
Scott: there will be a few thousand.

1004
01:01:58,163 --> 01:01:59,868
Scott: There'll be a few thousand people playing.

1005
01:01:59,888 --> 01:02:00,570
Rym: Yes, not jobs.

1006
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:08,383
Rym: I think counter-strike one six is going to maintain its thirty to fifty thousand players until those people until those people die.

1007
01:02:08,404 --> 01:02:15,750
Rym: so a Lot of new people are continuing to join that counter-strike community.

1008
01:02:16,951 --> 01:02:23,184
Rym: Yeah, that's I was playing some one six the other day and you know what a lot of the people on the voice chat way young.

1009
01:02:25,052 --> 01:02:26,598
Rym: It's kind of like Starcraft these.

1010
01:02:26,638 --> 01:02:32,210
Rym: they join this community because they feel like it's a more pure competition kind of like how to this day.

1011
01:02:32,491 --> 01:02:40,723
Rym: I think that lithium to deathmatch is is to me a better like Competition of certain kinds of skills in the deathmatch.

1012
01:02:40,803 --> 01:02:42,510
Rym: quake style then quake three.

1013
01:02:42,671 --> 01:02:44,621
Scott: Well, the thing is lithium deathmatch.

1014
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:50,263
Scott: while it is very great It has many weird things like the grappling hook the grappling hook.

1015
01:02:50,283 --> 01:02:52,330
Rym: You hold a button and a grapple shoots out.

1016
01:02:52,410 --> 01:02:56,344
Scott: Yes, but I mean it has a lot of weird crazy things like grappling hooks.

1017
01:02:56,405 --> 01:02:58,713
Scott: That's the only weird crazy thing I think it is.

1018
01:02:59,235 --> 01:03:00,660
Scott: I remember having a couple other crazy.

1019
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:03,610
Rym: Yeah, the runes which are identical to dolar and quite three.

1020
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:09,677
Rym: Don't You guys realize Doubler the doubler in quake three.

1021
01:03:09,697 --> 01:03:14,110
Rym: It was only in the last year that Scott and I realized that they were saying doubler.

1022
01:03:14,211 --> 01:03:16,310
Scott: No, I learned I knew that they were saying doubler a long time ago.

1023
01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:20,430
Scott: But the thing is it was so rare that a map actually had the dough.

1024
01:03:21,972 --> 01:03:24,470
Scott: Most maps just have a quad damage and that's it.

1025
01:03:25,251 --> 01:03:26,916
Scott: Very few maps have the dolar.

1026
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:27,378
Rym: Scott.

1027
01:03:27,418 --> 01:03:29,846
Rym: lithium deathmatch has the same runes.

1028
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:31,110
Rym: It's not different.

1029
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:37,570
Rym: The only difference is that you know quake two weapons quake two maps, which are actually much more three-dimensional.

1030
01:03:37,832 --> 01:03:47,190
Rym: I like quake two maps a lot better than quake three maps are no good Yeah, but it also had that that one change the grappling hook which made everything more three-dimensional.

1031
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:53,350
Scott: Yes, but it's sort of it's has a little bit of that ridiculousness to it that no Scott you are ridiculousness.

1032
01:03:53,611 --> 01:03:59,617
Rym: So there's a mod where instead of the laser grappling hook, which is pretty straightforward It's a grappling hook.

1033
01:03:59,637 --> 01:04:01,570
Scott: you swing and throw it with physics.

1034
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:04,847
Rym: So you had to bind four buttons to use this grappling hook.

1035
01:04:05,148 --> 01:04:13,881
Rym: grapple ungrapple draw in reel out And let me tell you that was crazy bullshit that I really enjoyed.

1036
01:04:13,921 --> 01:04:16,488
Rym: but I understand that most people would not enjoy that.

1037
01:04:16,668 --> 01:04:19,722
Scott: Yeah Counter-strike grappling hook at it.

1038
01:04:20,465 --> 01:04:21,350
Rym: Oh counter strike.

1039
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:28,830
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1040
01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:33,650
