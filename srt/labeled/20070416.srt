1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,827
Rym: It's Monday April 16th.

2
00:00:10,947 --> 00:00:12,312
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,492 --> 00:00:14,640
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:23,650
Rym: Tonight we talk a bit in entirely layman's terms about the history of CPUs and the battles between AMD and Intel.

5
00:00:26,662 --> 00:00:27,697
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,082 --> 00:00:30,243
Rym: It.

7
00:00:30,383 --> 00:00:36,487
Rym: uh, it rained a little bit a little a little still raining though, yeah Yeah, you see I was all excited.

8
00:00:36,507 --> 00:00:37,109
Rym: It was summer.

9
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:38,293
Rym: Everything is beautiful.

10
00:00:38,313 --> 00:00:39,377
Rym: I was climbing the mountain.

11
00:00:39,417 --> 00:00:39,678
Scott: summary.

12
00:00:39,718 --> 00:00:40,220
Scott: It's still spring.

13
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:41,427
Rym: It's effectively summer.

14
00:00:41,447 --> 00:00:47,317
Rym: remember as far as I'm concerned there are two seasons Warm enough to run outside in shorts and not warm enough to run outside.

15
00:00:47,357 --> 00:00:51,294
Scott: in short yeah Rym Just sort of decides things for himself and acts like you know.

16
00:00:51,314 --> 00:00:52,560
Scott: the rest of the world doesn't exist.

17
00:00:53,082 --> 00:00:54,768
Rym: I'm just generally indifferent to spring.

18
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:59,025
Rym: spring is just in my way to summer and fall is just the last Lingerings of summer.

19
00:00:59,346 --> 00:00:59,949
Rym: so pretty much.

20
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:02,080
Scott: I'm actually a fan more of real spring.

21
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,952
Scott: I wish real spring would let you be real spring real spring.

22
00:01:05,013 --> 00:01:06,037
Rym: it rains all the time.

23
00:01:06,097 --> 00:01:07,744
Rym: It's muddy Everything's mucky.

24
00:01:07,764 --> 00:01:11,740
Rym: you see all the leaves from the previous autumn that didn't rot yet see a real spring.

25
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:17,580
Scott: It's not cold, and it's warm, but it's not so warm that you sweat all over the place, which is perfect.

26
00:01:17,741 --> 00:01:20,816
Scott: It's like 65 degrees all the time, but of course we don't have real spring.

27
00:01:20,836 --> 00:01:21,660
Scott: We've got shit.

28
00:01:22,222 --> 00:01:23,747
Rym: I don't know really what you're talking about.

29
00:01:24,088 --> 00:01:24,570
Rym: It's spring.

30
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:24,971
Rym: what?

31
00:01:25,212 --> 00:01:27,640
Scott: when did real spring happen when I was a kid?

32
00:01:28,263 --> 00:01:31,498
Rym: I don't think spring was much different when you were a kid than it is now.

33
00:01:31,518 --> 00:01:42,101
Scott: plus I like rain as long as it's not constant insane or you know like this because this rain sucks where I go down to the train station in the morning and there's water burbling out Of the sewer.

34
00:01:42,142 --> 00:01:47,740
Rym: except this rain really isn't too out of the norm for this area and in fact we had similar rainstorms last year.

35
00:01:48,201 --> 00:01:51,210
Rym: Yeah, it sucked then too, and I lived here the year before.

36
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,660
Rym: you know what same kind of rain storms suck then also.

37
00:01:55,164 --> 00:01:56,658
Rym: Yeah, it's not anything special.

38
00:01:57,483 --> 00:02:01,378
Rym: The interesting thing here is that it took me almost four hours to get to work.

39
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:04,380
Scott: well I mean I can understand snow making it take four hours to get to work.

40
00:02:04,661 --> 00:02:13,051
Rym: No during that crazy crazy blizzard where everyone was stranded on the highways all over around here and all the parkways were just covered in Snow I got home in an hour and a half.

41
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:14,560
Rym: I just took the mountain back roads.

42
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,918
Rym: There was no one on him just drove right through, but no a little bit of rain.

43
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:24,578
Rym: first There's a rock slide on the road I normally take to work the walking like those metal things up to keep the rocks from falling down.

44
00:02:24,698 --> 00:02:26,404
Scott: yes Good job.

45
00:02:26,705 --> 00:02:29,778
Rym: It was one hell of a little mudslide rock slide, and it covered the road.

46
00:02:29,798 --> 00:02:30,200
Rym: so whatever.

47
00:02:30,882 --> 00:02:37,120
Rym: Well I sat there for an hour while they removed it and in that hour every single road to New York City flooded.

48
00:02:38,943 --> 00:02:47,211
Scott: Yeah, I was at work And I saw news that said the taconic was flooded and closed at a bunch of places And I tried to tell you but you were not able to be talked to.

49
00:02:47,954 --> 00:02:52,255
Scott: and then I checked the trains And they were like yeah, there's some flooding at the Beacon train station.

50
00:02:52,295 --> 00:02:52,738
Scott: I'm like shit.

51
00:02:53,563 --> 00:02:56,360
Rym: Beacon train station floods once a year, and it's only that back park.

52
00:02:56,501 --> 00:03:00,585
Scott: I was saying I parked in the front parking lot, and I was like oh It's probably only the back parking lot.

53
00:03:00,645 --> 00:03:04,220
Scott: sure enough the back parking lot must have flooded and unflooded during the days.

54
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,498
Rym: I'm the only suckers parking that back parking lot.

55
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:14,060
Scott: well It's I think the people who parked back there are People who were like been here for a long time because they used to be the only parking lot And it's people with permits.

56
00:03:14,401 --> 00:03:22,580
Scott: So I think the people who have permits and they've had them for a long time are the people who parked back there Which I don't know why you think they'd be smart enough by now to park somewhere else.

57
00:03:24,089 --> 00:03:24,760
Scott: Yeah, but they closed.

58
00:03:24,901 --> 00:03:32,333
Scott: I think they were pretty smart though because they closed off the most flooded part of the parking lot this morning Because no one was parked there, and there was yellow tape saying don't park you.

59
00:03:32,654 --> 00:03:41,920
Rym: yeah luckily with my works policy I pretty much just left work at the normal time and it counts as a full day, but on the way home I'm driving back, and I think I'm gonna stop and get some ice cream or something.

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:53,147
Rym: But I see this huge crowd of people standing by the old dam the turn of the century Dam with the old mill connected to it on the little creek that goes through Beacon and this giant crowd of people just Looking around.

61
00:03:53,188 --> 00:03:54,120
Rym: a bunch of have cameras.

62
00:03:54,663 --> 00:03:55,910
Rym: So I stopped the car and I get out.

63
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:56,554
Rym: cuz what they find?

64
00:03:56,574 --> 00:03:56,936
Rym: a body.

65
00:03:56,957 --> 00:03:57,480
Rym: what's going on?

66
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:11,260
Rym: I got to see what's going on here And I have to have my camera with me And I hear a roar and I look and the creek has become a torrential Horrible river that is completely covered and is blasting across this dam an incredible velocity of volume.

67
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:19,839
Scott: You just seen out the window of the train because the train is basically in between the Hudson River and the land And all the water coming down the sides of the land into the river.

68
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:24,080
Scott: There was quite a lot of it especially when the train went like by some rocks.

69
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:31,220
Scott: They're just water like flying off the rocks And there was like whitewater rapids only very small ones so only mice and their little boats could go and have fun.

70
00:04:31,675 --> 00:04:36,556
Scott: but They were like maybe like three feet wide, but they were rushing down that mountain real quick.

71
00:04:36,978 --> 00:04:37,440
Scott: It's pretty fun.

72
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:49,820
Rym: Anyway in tech news I was nominally gonna talk about this idea that Firefox looks like it's reaching the 25% mark in Europe And it's almost at 50% in a bunch of countries like Finland.

73
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,535
Rym: But I've got something much more important here because I'm slashed out.

74
00:04:54,575 --> 00:04:59,189
Rym: there was some stupid article Entitled is Dvorak gaining traction among coders?

75
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,412
Rym: the answer is no.

76
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:05,027
Scott: well when I was in college there were nominally You know those Dvorak guys.

77
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:07,356
Scott: I know some of them, so I do one Steve.

78
00:05:07,436 --> 00:05:08,440
Scott: well some of them were good guys.

79
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:16,852
Scott: Some of them are bad guys But you know there were always a few guys in the code especially in the CS department was pretty is the only place to find These people and they were like yeah, Dvorak's the way to go.

80
00:05:17,093 --> 00:05:21,661
Rym: well you see most people's keyboards I don't think a lot of people know what Dvorak is are QWERTY.

81
00:05:22,344 --> 00:05:30,858
Rym: if you wonder why it's called QWERTY look at your keyboard and look at the the second row from the top right under The numbers and it should become apparent rather quickly Why it is called QWERTY?

82
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,547
Rym: Dvorak is called Dvorak for pretty much the same reason.

83
00:05:33,768 --> 00:05:39,067
Scott: no Dvorak is called Dvorak because the guy named Dvorak all right I've never actually seen a Dvorak keyboard.

84
00:05:39,288 --> 00:05:43,143
Scott: all the vowels are generally like right under your fingers And what it the.

85
00:05:43,684 --> 00:05:55,637
Scott: the logic behind a Dvorak layout is that the most commonly used letters are all hit with the mate your Index fingers and then your middle finger and the least used letters are out by the pinkies and things like that.

86
00:05:56,018 --> 00:05:57,362
Scott: so it's Technically.

87
00:05:57,382 --> 00:06:04,044
Scott: you should have to move your fingers the least distance possible to type any Random text.

88
00:06:04,505 --> 00:06:20,036
Rym: well the issue is that while a lot of people say oh Dvorak is more efficient or oh look It's based on science and QWERTY was made to slow down typist back when typewriters used to jam and almost everyone I've ever met who uses Dvorak makes those two arguments well in terms of the latter.

89
00:06:20,276 --> 00:06:21,300
Rym: That's complete horseshit.

90
00:06:21,623 --> 00:06:22,557
Rym: I'll get that out right now.

91
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,968
Rym: QWERTY was designed for a bunch of reasons.

92
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:28,300
Rym: none of them at all had to do with slowing typist down.

93
00:06:28,842 --> 00:06:37,980
Scott: Number one the reason that QWERTY was designed the way it was is that you didn't have to because on a typewriter You know there's you can't have two hammers from the same side come at once.

94
00:06:38,622 --> 00:06:41,814
Scott: So it was to alternate as much as possible while typing.

95
00:06:41,854 --> 00:06:43,260
Scott: that way you could actually go faster.

96
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:51,240
Scott: And you know what alternating is sort of faster when you type whether you have Mechanical typewriters or not because you're going left right left right left right left right left right.

97
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,860
Rym: Yeah, a lot of people claim that oh QWERTY was made to slow people down to Dvorak is faster blah blah blah.

98
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:01,400
Rym: But it turns out that QWERTY is actually a very very efficient system of typing.

99
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:07,740
Scott: I mean think about all the different possible ways you could lay out the letters without changing the way the keys are oriented.

100
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:10,700
Scott: You know just moving the letters around on the existing keys.

101
00:07:10,961 --> 00:07:18,591
Scott: There are like a zillion jajillion ways you could possibly arrange those letters And if you calculated the efficiency of typing and all possible layouts.

102
00:07:19,052 --> 00:07:21,720
Scott: QWERTY is one of the most efficient layouts possible.

103
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,268
Scott: It's nowhere near the bottom.

104
00:07:23,751 --> 00:07:29,420
Rym: now two people say oh There's all these studies saying that Dvorak is X percentage more efficient or X percentage more.

105
00:07:31,546 --> 00:07:39,268
Rym: You can type faster on average and there has never actually been a real Valid scientific study of any merit.

106
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:47,752
Rym: and almost all those numbers are either made up or based on studies that are Let's say have a dubious and tenuous grasp on science at best.

107
00:07:48,073 --> 00:07:50,560
Scott: Yeah, I mean Dvorak really isn't bad.

108
00:07:50,823 --> 00:07:52,238
Scott: I mean, it's not any worse thing.

109
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:57,598
Rym: now I submit that it is bad and the reason it's bad is that one QWERTY is the standard the world over.

110
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:07,433
Rym: so Choosing to use Dvorak is basically saying I am going to choose to use a very Rarely used method of inputting data into a computer.

111
00:08:07,715 --> 00:08:12,737
Rym: that will often cause me Difficulty and will also cause difficulty to anyone else who attempts to use my computer.

112
00:08:12,898 --> 00:08:13,420
Scott: Well, that's true.

113
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:18,700
Scott: However, a lot of people have real easy ways to just switch their keyboard from QWERTY to Dvorak with like the push of a button.

114
00:08:19,162 --> 00:08:22,197
Scott: It's pretty much anyone using Dvorak has a key combination.

115
00:08:22,217 --> 00:08:22,740
Scott: That'll do that.

116
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,595
Rym: Well, yeah in the software, but keyboard still looks wrong.

117
00:08:25,816 --> 00:08:31,280
Scott: That's true But you don't if you see if you're looking at the keyboard you suck anyway, and it doesn't matter Dvorak or QWERTY.

118
00:08:31,481 --> 00:08:35,380
Rym: Yeah, but the thing is all the Dvorak people also buy the expensive Dvorak.

119
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,299
Scott: No, I noticed most Dvorak people just use a QWERTY keyboard or a blank keyboard.

120
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,565
Scott: They don't even bother to get it.

121
00:08:40,684 --> 00:08:44,760
Rym: now a lot of the ones I knew at RIT actually bought old IBM keyboards.

122
00:08:44,922 --> 00:08:53,380
Scott: We can switch the keys around When I actually do that and I've only actually seen maybe two keyboards you can actually buy that had the letters laid out.

123
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,933
Rym: In fact a guy in one of my IT remember we had all those key AT keyboards we found And we kept him for a while.

124
00:08:58,953 --> 00:08:59,600
Rym: then we threw him away.

125
00:09:00,022 --> 00:09:03,480
Rym: Someone asked me for one when he found out I had one because he wanted to make a Dvorak keyboard.

126
00:09:03,701 --> 00:09:08,840
Scott: Yeah, well most of the people I knew no one ever real actually cared about the letters being laid out that way.

127
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:17,649
Scott: but even so some people who use the Dvorak they claim they can just switch back to QWERTY like ah and Some people when they actually do.

128
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:19,900
Scott: I've actually seen them struggle going back to QWERTY.

129
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,940
Scott: So I guess it comes down to are you actually gonna be able to avoid QWERTY?

130
00:09:24,401 --> 00:09:27,993
Scott: If not, can you just switch back and forth or can you not?

131
00:09:28,053 --> 00:09:30,039
Scott: and I imagine some people can and some people can't.

132
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:41,840
Rym: Yep, especially considering that touch typing is mostly muscle memory and that sort of thing I can't imagine it being efficient to have two entirely different systems that are mostly Instinctual that you have to work with on a regular basis.

133
00:09:42,272 --> 00:09:51,519
Rym: Yeah that the main reason I bring this up is that this seems to come into the news cyclically like every six months or so where All the people who use Dvorak like yeah Dvorak's better blah blah blah.

134
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:56,640
Rym: And I found that the vast majority of people use Dvorak are twats they just are posers.

135
00:09:56,921 --> 00:10:00,190
Rym: They use it because it's cool and hip to use or check it out.

136
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,880
Rym: I use Dvorak which is far superior to your commoner QWERTY.

137
00:10:04,101 --> 00:10:11,980
Scott: Yeah, the only way I can respect someone who uses Dvorak is if they say yeah, I just like it better Whatever because some people just it's a matter of taste.

138
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,830
Scott: It's not you know more or less efficient really.

139
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,278
Scott: I mean, you know, and if it is we can't really tell it.

140
00:10:17,961 --> 00:10:20,236
Scott: But for some people it's more comfortable for them.

141
00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:25,560
Scott: Yeah Yeah, the thing is kids I'm not gonna say that they're lying about something like that.

142
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,274
Rym: I've only ever met one person who wasn't just a pretentious twat about it.

143
00:10:29,314 --> 00:10:30,298
Rym: And that was our friend Steve.

144
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:39,260
Rym: Yep He's seriously the only person I've ever met as far as I know Because there might be some closet Dvorak users out there who actually uses it and isn't pretentious about it.

145
00:10:39,561 --> 00:10:47,196
Rym: And in fact all the people other than Steve who use it always seem to bring it up more often than would be Normally expect expected in a conversation.

146
00:10:47,498 --> 00:10:51,320
Scott: actually You know what the best Dvorak user would be someone who keeps it a secret like before you use that.

147
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,693
Scott: They can have a QWERTY keyboard before you use their keyboard.

148
00:10:53,713 --> 00:10:54,638
Scott: They switch it so you don't know.

149
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,649
Scott: Yeah, that would be the best Dvorak user.

150
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,539
Rym: So I guess Dvorak's got to be a lot like religion.

151
00:11:01,022 --> 00:11:05,020
Scott: It sort of is in a way yeah because it's not based on fags.

152
00:11:07,187 --> 00:11:08,420
Rym: Anyway, what do you got?

153
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:19,220
Scott: So is this big news story going around about how Adobe's putting DRMs and ads or something in flash and a lot of people didn't read the story and don't understand what is actually saying.

154
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,384
Rym: Yep, there was a lot of fun.

155
00:11:20,866 --> 00:11:24,320
Scott: A lot of people are like, oh no is youtubes will be full of ads in DRM.

156
00:11:24,681 --> 00:11:28,533
Scott: It's over and I'm like, uh, dude, what did you.

157
00:11:28,593 --> 00:11:29,175
Scott: did you read?

158
00:11:29,637 --> 00:11:30,680
Scott: Did you even read this article?

159
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,694
Rym: Well, you didn't read nothing for the benefit of all of the people out there.

160
00:11:34,755 --> 00:11:36,120
Rym: What is the actual story here?

161
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,467
Scott: Well Adobe is check this out.

162
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:39,390
Scott: You got flash right.

163
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:45,640
Scott: flash does animations and things but there's also flash video Which is what makes it things like YouTube and such possible.

164
00:11:45,942 --> 00:11:53,480
Scott: It's a way to put videos in Flash where you can download them pretty quick and watch them in your browser and everything's happy as long as your browser is flash.

165
00:11:53,581 --> 00:11:55,494
Rym: Don't have to worry about codecs or all the business.

166
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:58,204
Rym: We used to have to worry about Yep, no, no, no.

167
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:03,320
Scott: to plug your media player into your browser is an embeddable whatever and then get codecs.

168
00:12:03,581 --> 00:12:05,750
Scott: It's just flash video and if you have flash it plays.

169
00:12:06,272 --> 00:12:07,658
Scott: YouTube uses it everyone use it.

170
00:12:07,698 --> 00:12:07,980
Scott: It's great.

171
00:12:08,622 --> 00:12:12,217
Scott: Adobe is gonna add some features to the flash video.

172
00:12:12,578 --> 00:12:24,120
Scott: the features They're gonna add are as follows if you're making a flash video You will be able to make the video in such a way that you can force the person watching it to watch some ads.

173
00:12:24,663 --> 00:12:27,100
Scott: It doesn't mean every flash videos gonna be that way.

174
00:12:27,361 --> 00:12:32,440
Scott: It's just someone making a flash video can choose to put some ads in it or anything else.

175
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,680
Rym: They can show you the meat-spinning goatse for 10 seconds before you get to see your content.

176
00:12:36,982 --> 00:12:37,807
Scott: Imagine they could.

177
00:12:37,827 --> 00:12:42,848
Scott: I imagine people will yep They're also adding a DRM feature.

178
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:46,920
Scott: However, the DRM feature isn't gonna keep you from watching flash videos in a website.

179
00:12:47,282 --> 00:12:48,307
Scott: That's not what is there for.

180
00:12:48,749 --> 00:12:57,503
Scott: it's there to cover for another feature They're adding which is that you're gonna be able to download flash videos and then play them off your computer without having to be online Or anything.

181
00:12:57,523 --> 00:12:58,126
Scott: so you could go.

182
00:12:58,147 --> 00:13:00,420
Scott: let's say YouTube implemented this feature.

183
00:13:00,882 --> 00:13:21,218
Scott: You could go onto YouTube download a bunch of YouTube videos without having to use all the crazy Firefox plugins or whatever people are using to do it these days Download them and watch them later And if YouTube wants they could make it so that when you download videos from YouTube those videos have some DRM So that you can't go copying them all over the internet, but it's only if YouTube wants.

184
00:13:21,338 --> 00:13:32,451
Scott: basically It's three features added to flash that people who make flash video can choose whether they use or not use and I don't think YouTube's gonna use it considering they're still using the flash 7.

185
00:13:32,451 --> 00:13:34,438
Rym: Yeah, YouTube seems to be doing okay.

186
00:13:34,598 --> 00:13:35,664
Scott: so far I don't know what.

187
00:13:35,745 --> 00:13:37,500
Scott: I don't see Google video using this either.

188
00:13:37,821 --> 00:13:56,012
Scott: the only people I see using this are people who run other flash video sites that already have ads in some way and Media old-school media companies who have videos on their sites like, you know, you go to Comedy Central calm They'll make you watch an ad and maybe if you're lucky They'll let you download something to watch later with a DRM if

189
00:13:56,112 --> 00:13:56,454
Rym: anything.

190
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:57,398
Rym: I expect

191
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:57,699
Scott: all your

192
00:13:57,719 --> 00:14:11,999
Rym: friends I expect this to actually make YouTube more used or more popular because YouTube is gonna do it right and most likely either not implement this sort of thing at all or Do it in a tasteful or sparing manner while plays like meta cafe or all those other?

193
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,359
Rym: Wannabe youtubes are probably just gonna go whole hog with the ads.

194
00:14:16,104 --> 00:14:18,460
Scott: I imagine most people go haul hog with the ads.

195
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:24,219
Scott: Especially the people who you're trying to make a lot of money as opposed to being owned by Google don't need to make money.

196
00:14:26,037 --> 00:14:28,000
Scott: So Yes, that clears that up for everyone.

197
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:37,800
Scott: I hope there are going to be bad features added to flash video But no one's forcing anyone to use them and it's up to the people who put the videos online whether they use them or not.

198
00:14:38,202 --> 00:14:44,193
Rym: So my suggestion to everyone out there is whenever you see a story particularly on slashdot or Fark or dig.

199
00:14:44,213 --> 00:14:59,267
Rym: in fact the more inflammatory inflammatory or Frightening to you the headline is the more dubious of it You should be in the more you should probably I don't know read the article see what it actually says as opposed to OMG ads onto youtubes.

200
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:02,820
Scott: Yep, and if you're like me sometimes you read an article that you don't understand.

201
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:12,172
Scott: Like I'll read an article about some new medicine and I'll say I don't understand the fuck shit this article saying even though I read It and then I ask someone who knows because I don't know.

202
00:15:12,554 --> 00:15:15,754
Rym: granted unlike you people out there We have our resident scientists.

203
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:16,299
Scott: Oh, yes.

204
00:15:16,561 --> 00:15:24,306
Scott: So if you read an article about something computer II and you don't understand it or you're skeptical and even though you read it You're not sure you're 100% right.

205
00:15:24,748 --> 00:15:25,992
Scott: Don't go saying stuff.

206
00:15:26,353 --> 00:15:35,808
Scott: Ask me first cuz I know Things of the day.

207
00:15:35,828 --> 00:15:41,292
Rym: I hate to take something that's on the front page of dig Especially when it's on the front page of dig the day I do it.

208
00:15:41,312 --> 00:15:41,714
Scott: That's okay.

209
00:15:41,734 --> 00:15:42,920
Scott: I'm taking something from big videos.

210
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,379
Scott: It's a lazy day.

211
00:15:44,761 --> 00:15:57,300
Rym: I had to go with this one because again there wasn't much exciting on the internet and to I want to point out This kind of person because this is one of those kinds of people that I really dislike and I run afoul of often.

212
00:15:57,721 --> 00:15:59,989
Rym: See Quentin Tarantino is my man.

213
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,156
Rym: He makes those kinds of movies that I like.

214
00:16:02,397 --> 00:16:04,008
Scott: He hasn't made a movie I don't like.

215
00:16:04,493 --> 00:16:05,079
Scott: not one.

216
00:16:05,341 --> 00:16:10,680
Rym: Yeah, I can't think of a Tarantino movie that I've seen that I did not enjoy sort of like Satoshi khan in a way.

217
00:16:10,901 --> 00:16:13,639
Scott: Yeah, can't go wrong for now.

218
00:16:14,483 --> 00:16:15,627
Rym: One day he'll turn on us.

219
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:16,933
Scott: if he turns on us.

220
00:16:16,993 --> 00:16:17,696
Scott: I'll just be the end.

221
00:16:17,716 --> 00:16:18,740
Scott: I won't watch movies anymore.

222
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,266
Scott: I'll just watch the same ones over and over.

223
00:16:20,286 --> 00:16:24,160
Rym: just watch snatch and boondock Saints over and over until you die.

224
00:16:24,642 --> 00:16:26,648
Scott: I guess I think about it.

225
00:16:26,748 --> 00:16:30,280
Scott: all the old people like our parents our parents didn't catch on to new music.

226
00:16:30,521 --> 00:16:35,806
Scott: They just listen to music they listen to in the 70s and the 60s over and over again until today And they're still listening to it.

227
00:16:36,108 --> 00:16:37,958
Scott: Why can't I watch the same movies from?

228
00:16:37,979 --> 00:16:38,079
Scott: well?

229
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:43,780
Rym: I think part of that is that our parents listen to the Beatles and Led Zeppelin and they're still the some of the best.

230
00:16:44,923 --> 00:16:45,285
Scott: You don't see.

231
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:46,651
Scott: it's not the point.

232
00:16:46,993 --> 00:16:47,938
Scott: you understand what I'm saying.

233
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:51,434
Rym: Yeah But way back after kill bill came out.

234
00:16:51,454 --> 00:16:52,480
Rym: I don't know if this is one or two.

235
00:16:52,861 --> 00:16:55,614
Rym: I just watched this clip and I did not do any research.

236
00:16:55,674 --> 00:16:56,880
Scott: pretty sure they're talking about one.

237
00:16:57,141 --> 00:17:06,513
Rym: Yeah, but this kind of fugly looking Movie reviewer gets Quentin Tarantino on her show to talk about kill bill now.

238
00:17:07,075 --> 00:17:08,157
Rym: This is that kind of person.

239
00:17:08,218 --> 00:17:10,066
Rym: I just like Lady.

240
00:17:10,247 --> 00:17:17,338
Rym: she's fat and indignant but more importantly she does this exact thing that I have had so many people do to me in my day.

241
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:36,237
Rym: and While it's infuriating at the same time It's hilarious because whenever someone does this to you and remember take heed Anytime someone acts this way towards you you have already won because what you were saying is making them so uncomfortable That they will still be thinking about it tonight when they try to go to sleep and you'll have already forgotten

242
00:17:36,498 --> 00:17:37,080
Scott: or be laughing.

243
00:17:37,522 --> 00:17:41,380
Scott: Yes, if someone actually brings it up again, you'll be like, oh, that's still around.

244
00:17:42,942 --> 00:17:48,740
Rym: So she gets him on the show and she's nominally talking about kill bill But she obviously has an agenda.

245
00:17:49,061 --> 00:17:57,759
Rym: she obviously is going to corner him about some issue that got crawled off her butt and She's gonna make a stink about it and make him feel bad and make him look bad.

246
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,607
Rym: Luckily Quentin Tarantino is the man.

247
00:18:00,888 --> 00:18:02,714
Scott: So he's a little bit crazy, but doesn't matter.

248
00:18:02,775 --> 00:18:05,206
Rym: He's sitting there and he's like, yeah I made kill bill.

249
00:18:05,448 --> 00:18:06,698
Rym: I like to run a hockey jersey.

250
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:09,912
Scott: Yes Everything's excused when you're wearing a hockey jersey.

251
00:18:09,992 --> 00:18:11,220
Rym: I was gonna point that out at the end.

252
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,429
Rym: I was like and he was wearing a hockey jersey.

253
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,200
Rym: Yep, but so he's all again kill bills.

254
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:17,166
Rym: Awesome blah blah blah.

255
00:18:17,408 --> 00:18:24,380
Rym: and then the woman after a little bit of small talk Looks at a piece of paper and looks up and says now, uh, I want to make sure that you weren't misquoted here.

256
00:18:24,461 --> 00:18:25,329
Rym: So could you clarify?

257
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:26,398
Rym: did you actually say this?

258
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:32,316
Scott: Twelve year olds should see kill bill and he's like, yeah twelve year old should see it.

259
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:33,720
Scott: At least the ones with the cool parents.

260
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:34,223
Rym: Yeah, it's like.

261
00:18:34,243 --> 00:18:34,988
Scott: that's the kind of thing.

262
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:36,759
Scott: I would say like yeah, what of it?

263
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:43,489
Rym: He's like, yeah, if a parent wants to bring their 12 year old kid to see kill bill I say great I grew up watching violent movies.

264
00:18:43,509 --> 00:18:45,340
Rym: I grew up to make violent movies.

265
00:18:45,782 --> 00:18:46,766
Rym: I never heard anybody.

266
00:18:46,786 --> 00:18:48,432
Scott: It's a lot of fun.

267
00:18:48,533 --> 00:18:49,396
Scott: It's entertaining.

268
00:18:49,456 --> 00:18:51,203
Scott: It's not the real world It's the fake world.

269
00:18:51,223 --> 00:18:55,858
Rym: the woman thinks that she has won the argument and she gives that look of.

270
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:59,009
Rym: haha You have fallen into my clever trap.

271
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:02,140
Rym: watch as I humiliate you before the masses.

272
00:19:03,522 --> 00:19:19,320
Rym: For she thinks that now that he's admitted that yes He thinks 12 year olds should watch kill bill that somehow he is admitted something wrong or that somehow she is now won this argument And it couldn't be further from the truth because she gets all indignant.

273
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:23,819
Rym: And so you're saying that kids should watch violent movies and she expected him to go.

274
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,250
Rym: Well, maybe yeah, but instead he goes.

275
00:19:27,772 --> 00:19:28,013
Rym: Yep.

276
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:29,579
Rym: What you gonna do about it?

277
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:38,152
Rym: And she starts getting really really really indignant and she does that thing where she sits back Folds her arms and does that smile of.

278
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:39,680
Rym: I already won this argument.

279
00:19:39,963 --> 00:19:43,086
Rym: I'm gonna sit here and let you talk But I'm ignoring everything you say.

280
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:54,290
Rym: cuz I know that the people are on my side and the deep down in my bitter little heart I'm right and these doubts I'm feeling don't exist and you're not making me uncomfortable You're not touching a sore spot.

281
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,659
Rym: Please stop talking.

282
00:19:56,422 --> 00:20:05,988
Scott: And meanwhile, she's a fat indignant lady and Quentin Tarantino is as she even admits a really rich Famous movie guy wearing a hockey jersey.

283
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:09,140
Scott: and we people like him and they don't like her.

284
00:20:09,621 --> 00:20:17,808
Rym: So the next time you see people like this remember this video and remember that the moment someone gets that way You've already won far and away.

285
00:20:17,828 --> 00:20:21,520
Scott: Yeah, all you can do because you're never gonna like beat them to where they'll be like.

286
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,228
Scott: Oh, you're right.

287
00:20:22,511 --> 00:20:23,240
Scott: That's not gonna happen.

288
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:27,140
Scott: All you can do is make them as in comfort as uncomfortable as humanly possible.

289
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,580
Rym: And the funny thing is maybe they'll explode which is the best outcome because this happens all the time.

290
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,165
Rym: Remember back with that Frank Zappa thing?

291
00:20:33,546 --> 00:20:37,720
Rym: Yeah, where the guys like are you saying that blah blah blah blah blah and zap is like.

292
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:41,250
Rym: Yeah, yeah That's exactly what I'm saying.

293
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:41,874
Rym: You were correct.

294
00:20:41,915 --> 00:20:42,660
Rym: That is my stance.

295
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,223
Rym: What of it?

296
00:20:43,665 --> 00:20:46,880
Rym: and that always takes the thunder out of anyone who's trying to argue with you?

297
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:53,708
Scott: Well generally that happens when people have a stance That other people like like.

298
00:20:53,728 --> 00:21:00,520
Scott: they view the stance itself as inherently wrong And there's no evidence on the outside of it.

299
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,059
Scott: It's like they look at the stance itself.

300
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,415
Scott: Like this lady says children shouldn't be watching violent movies and she does this.

301
00:21:06,495 --> 00:21:12,680
Scott: she doesn't have any evidence either way But she takes that statement in and of itself to be a wrong thing as if I had said the sky was green.

302
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:13,524
Scott: Yeah, you know.

303
00:21:13,665 --> 00:21:16,560
Rym: so this isn't a contest for a prize or anything.

304
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,789
Rym: But uh, you all your listeners out there.

305
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:23,649
Rym: that is in fact a fairly specific logical fallacy And I'd like to see who posted in the forum.

306
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,538
Scott: Let's see logical fallacy of no evidence.

307
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:37,059
Rym: No No, there's a logical fallacy of taking an unfounded statement or taking what would be an argument Making it as a statement and then using that as the basis for further argumentation.

308
00:21:38,181 --> 00:21:39,225
Scott: That's not quite what this is.

309
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:41,594
Rym: But anyway, it is her statement.

310
00:21:42,056 --> 00:21:43,180
Rym: She's taking as truth.

311
00:21:43,481 --> 00:21:46,671
Rym: She's not saying if blah blah blah then blah.

312
00:21:46,711 --> 00:21:49,460
Rym: She's saying blah blah blah unfounded assertion.

313
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,374
Rym: Therefore you're wrong.

314
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:57,570
Scott: Yeah, so I Saw this cool thing on dig video today.

315
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:03,260
Scott: You remember back at RIT There was always those guys who were really into juggling and really into unicycling.

316
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:05,259
Rym: Yep, there was a lot of overlap in those two clubs.

317
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:13,770
Scott: There was there was a juggling club and I don't know if it was unicycling club But there were some guys who were just geeks total geeks for juggling and total geeks for you.

318
00:22:13,951 --> 00:22:24,890
Rym: actually as far as I recall I forget if it was the Unicycling club and there was a club or the juggling club, but in terms of the sizes of clubs at RIT It was pretty much the anime club was the biggest.

319
00:22:25,091 --> 00:22:27,320
Rym: the gaming club was the second biggest right there.

320
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,406
Rym: It was like the juggling club.

321
00:22:28,466 --> 00:22:30,919
Scott: Well, no, there was the formula SAE guys.

322
00:22:30,979 --> 00:22:33,159
Rym: Yeah Formula SAE is a special case.

323
00:22:33,348 --> 00:22:36,291
Rym: Yeah Cuz all the people who raced cars at RIT.

324
00:22:36,532 --> 00:22:41,070
Rym: a lot of people joined because they wanted to race the cars But Scott and I were smart and Scott was the one who asked.

325
00:22:41,432 --> 00:22:42,978
Rym: so what are the chances that I will ever?

326
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:43,460
Scott: that's the thing.

327
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:57,787
Scott: When I went to RIT, you know Well, I didn't go there for the race car thing because it was mostly an engineering building a car thing Which has nothing to do with computer science not much anyway So but I knew it was there and I said, you know what if I don't bother to ask It's not gonna happen?

328
00:22:57,827 --> 00:23:00,020
Scott: and if it doesn't happen, I don't care because I wasn't expecting it.

329
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:06,993
Scott: Anyway, so I went when I was a freshman and I knew they had this program of formula SAE and I said Is there a chance I will ever race that car?

330
00:23:07,033 --> 00:23:08,360
Scott: because it's the only thing I want to do.

331
00:23:08,441 --> 00:23:09,691
Scott: I don't know shit about engineering.

332
00:23:09,711 --> 00:23:10,700
Scott: I don't know shit about cars.

333
00:23:11,222 --> 00:23:13,954
Scott: I want to race the car because I know a lot about driving and it's fun.

334
00:23:14,295 --> 00:23:18,996
Scott: and they said no There is no chance you will ever drive this car freshman and I said, thank you.

335
00:23:19,337 --> 00:23:19,638
Rym: Goodbye.

336
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,820
Rym: Yep You'll never see me again, but a lot of the people who join the club heads these aspirations.

337
00:23:24,981 --> 00:23:31,466
Rym: They would somehow get to drive the car and I know for a fact that a very small percentage of people in that club Ever got to even sit in that seat.

338
00:23:31,747 --> 00:23:34,316
Scott: Yep, very few people actually drive that car.

339
00:23:34,557 --> 00:23:35,460
Scott: I've seen it driving around.

340
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,847
Scott: It's actually pretty fast.

341
00:23:36,907 --> 00:23:39,640
Rym: Well, yeah, cuz I'd always for club crap on the weekends.

342
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:43,880
Rym: I'd go over to campus on like Sunday morning when no one's there and then I walk off a parking lot.

343
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:47,489
Rym: They put cones out Yeah, and they just be racing it around doing times.

344
00:23:47,589 --> 00:23:50,038
Rym: Fitz Hudson with it put different tires on.

345
00:23:50,058 --> 00:23:52,018
Scott: Yeah Yeah, never got to race that car.

346
00:23:52,842 --> 00:23:55,308
Scott: Anyway, there were unicycling guys at RIT.

347
00:23:55,328 --> 00:24:01,190
Scott: They unicycle to class the unicycle around when it was like spring And everyone was hanging out outside.

348
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,880
Scott: They were unicycle tricks in the quarter mile.

349
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:11,560
Rym: It was not an uncommon sight to be walking to class and to be passed by someone who was also going to class and has A backpack on but who was on a unicycle and juggling.

350
00:24:11,861 --> 00:24:15,800
Scott: Yeah, but they're not doing it like for entertainment like they're trying to entertain you.

351
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,293
Scott: They're just unicycling the class just as normally.

352
00:24:18,334 --> 00:24:19,480
Scott: as someone who's like the class

353
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,403
Rym: I just realize

354
00:24:20,423 --> 00:24:20,885
Scott: the class

355
00:24:21,066 --> 00:24:36,310
Rym: thinking back and looking at the things I saw on a daily basis Just walk into class at RIT or looking out my window of my apartment Really make RIT look like this kind of bedlam carnaval Weird place where weird things happen.

356
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:38,419
Scott: So I was a great place to live it was.

357
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:42,010
Scott: but Those guys I realize now we're shitty unicycling.

358
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,315
Scott: They sucked at unicycling.

359
00:24:43,355 --> 00:24:48,860
Scott: I mean in terms of transportation They were better unicycling than say me who can't stand up on a unicycle at all.

360
00:24:49,442 --> 00:24:51,320
Rym: But I didn't end up for about four seconds.

361
00:24:51,861 --> 00:24:53,968
Scott: I I unicycled for about like five feet once.

362
00:24:54,569 --> 00:24:57,959
Scott: but they were not so good at the unicycling tricks.

363
00:24:58,744 --> 00:25:01,420
Scott: You mean they can maybe spin around on the unicycle a couple times.

364
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:09,490
Rym: I wouldn't say that they suck because even if you can't do a unicycle trick being able to unicycle for any Reasonable distance is a pretty cool feat.

365
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,780
Scott: in my opinion that that is the case.

366
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,294
Scott: They're definitely have the unicycling skills, but on the grand scale of unicycling skills.

367
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:20,540
Scott: They were in the you know amateur rank and file of unicyclers.

368
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:26,000
Rym: Yeah, even the best of it's the difference between in D&D a level one character and level zero character.

369
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,640
Scott: It's a difference between the kid in your high school who's really good at baseball and the major league stars?

370
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,411
Scott: Yeah, so you're looking for the major league stars of unicycling.

371
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:36,093
Scott: Where do you go?

372
00:25:36,574 --> 00:25:38,560
Rym: Well, I think Michael Godot the circus.

373
00:25:38,881 --> 00:25:41,474
Scott: No, no, I'm pretty sure the answer is China.

374
00:25:41,494 --> 00:25:45,540
Scott: cuz it looks Chinese to me I can't tell don't yell at me if I'm wrong and it's some other Asian country.

375
00:25:46,163 --> 00:25:54,560
Scott: But here is a woman who I think is a Chinese woman Unicycling better than I've seen anyone unicycle before and she's doing a lot of fancy stuff.

376
00:25:54,881 --> 00:25:57,980
Scott: I mean she falls off twice, but I can't tell if it's on purpose or not.

377
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,444
Scott: So she wins.

378
00:25:59,966 --> 00:26:04,740
Scott: watch this video and you will see possibly the world's best unicycling or close to it.

379
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:09,880
Rym: I was actually doing my taxes this time, but I looked up for a few seconds near the end and I was duly impressed.

380
00:26:10,883 --> 00:26:12,579
Scott: It's some crazy-ass unicycling going on.

381
00:26:13,081 --> 00:26:21,450
Rym: So this should be short and sweet because it's coming on to computer buying season here at GeekNights And Scott and I are both looking at buying new computers.

382
00:26:22,012 --> 00:26:23,880
Scott: I'm looking a little later than Rym, but that's alright.

383
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:36,944
Rym: Yeah, but you're starting the process because in my whole life and Scott's been mostly the same way I don't constantly keep abreast of exactly what is going on in like down-low Processor technology.

384
00:26:37,225 --> 00:26:38,989
Rym: is this processor faster than this one?

385
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,516
Rym: What motherboard chipset is currently the best one?

386
00:26:41,776 --> 00:26:43,140
Rym: what's going on with motherboards?

387
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,260
Scott: There are some people, you know, they subscribe to maximum PC and they read Tom's hardware.

388
00:26:48,905 --> 00:26:52,004
Rym: Maximum PC was a great magazine in like 1997.

389
00:26:52,004 --> 00:26:58,473
Scott: you know, there are those guys and they pay attention to overclocking and every time a new chip and a new video card or A new anything comes out.

390
00:26:58,493 --> 00:26:59,280
Scott: They're on top of it.

391
00:26:59,321 --> 00:27:05,679
Scott: They know Every single change in computer personal computer technology and they're always on top and they're always in the in the lead.

392
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,843
Scott: now I don't know.

393
00:27:06,964 --> 00:27:07,908
Scott: I don't have time for that either.

394
00:27:07,968 --> 00:27:11,060
Scott: So I only really pay attention when I need to build a computer.

395
00:27:11,202 --> 00:27:12,659
Scott: Yeah, but it's time to build a computer again.

396
00:27:13,202 --> 00:27:19,826
Scott: I go and I look and maybe if like a six months has gone by and I haven't looked I'll take a look just to see What's going on, you know go a new egg.

397
00:27:19,866 --> 00:27:20,930
Scott: I'll put a computer together.

398
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:27,811
Rym: see, you know, what new technologies there are and like we'll know Intel's making new chips or AMD has a new process.

399
00:27:27,851 --> 00:27:29,880
Rym: all the news, but we won't we won't remember.

400
00:27:30,402 --> 00:27:36,951
Rym: Well, there's actually two different cores on the new Intel block chip One of which has four megabytes of level 2 cache and what it will.

401
00:27:36,991 --> 00:27:43,733
Scott: sometimes this bites me in the ass because like they switched The ATX motherboard connectors to have four more pins to your credit.

402
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:46,424
Rym: They hadn't changed that in a long time I know.

403
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:47,936
Scott: how would I think that was gonna change?

404
00:27:47,956 --> 00:27:54,660
Rym: But anyway I remember when there was a sudden unexpected jump in the wattage required from a power supply to boot a modern motherboard.

405
00:27:54,862 --> 00:27:56,360
Scott: Yep, that bit us again.

406
00:27:56,521 --> 00:27:59,820
Scott: Yeah, it seems to be power supplies to bite you because they have the least news anyway.

407
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,691
Rym: But the only time it ever bit us was when we weren't looking for a computer.

408
00:28:02,711 --> 00:28:12,720
Rym: because whenever it gets to that time You know that time in a young man's life when he starts to notice the micro processors and realize that perhaps he needs a bigger one.

409
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:18,840
Rym: Yes, perhaps a faster one perhaps one that does not overheat perhaps one that is bigger and faster than his friend.

410
00:28:20,876 --> 00:28:24,315
Rym: And Generally what I do and I know a lot of people you can measure up.

411
00:28:24,717 --> 00:28:31,420
Rym: Yeah, basically Three to four months before like, you know, I'm gonna be building a computer sometime in the spring.

412
00:28:31,962 --> 00:28:37,549
Rym: So months before you start researching a little bit you start looking at Tom's Hardware You look at the most recent benchmark.

413
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:37,891
Scott: I'm sorry.

414
00:28:37,911 --> 00:28:39,380
Scott: We just got bought for a lot of money.

415
00:28:40,003 --> 00:28:41,048
Rym: We didn't talk about that did we?

416
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,012
Scott: it's not really that important.

417
00:28:42,093 --> 00:28:43,620
Rym: no, I didn't even pay attention to who bought it.

418
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,665
Scott: Yeah, me either watch.

419
00:28:44,705 --> 00:28:45,490
Rym: It's like Intel.

420
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:53,880
Rym: Yeah, but millions of dollars say go Yeah, yeah, Tom's run a pretty good generally reliable site for a long time and I've often relied on his benchmarks.

421
00:28:54,141 --> 00:28:57,039
Rym: Yep, granted benchmarks aren't what they used to be, but that's a whole other show.

422
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,089
Rym: Benchmarks used to work.

423
00:28:59,351 --> 00:29:04,656
Rym: if you look into benchmarks It was like that chip is clearly 40% faster than that chip nowadays.

424
00:29:04,696 --> 00:29:05,520
Scott: Not so much now.

425
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,540
Rym: It's too complicated, but we're not gonna talk.

426
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:20,436
Rym: I mean we've talked about how to build a computer before but in terms of Processors just processors and I guess as an extension of that Motherboards and motherboard chipsets only because they're directly related to process sockets.

427
00:29:20,697 --> 00:29:25,534
Rym: Yeah, and all that stuff We're gonna do because these layman's terms computer shows have been really popular.

428
00:29:25,955 --> 00:29:34,380
Rym: We're gonna talk about Microprocessors for consumers in layman's terms from the perspective of the consumer of these goods.

429
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:44,060
Rym: So people like us and people like you who build your own computers Through the years what the market has been like and how it's evolved because it's actually kind of an interesting story.

430
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,973
Scott: We're not gonna talk about like, you know the history behind them.

431
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,500
Scott: Like what was going on at the companies.

432
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:52,079
Scott: We're not gonna talk about the specific technologies that were added or how they work.

433
00:29:52,247 --> 00:29:57,736
Scott: Yeah We're not gonna talk about Risk or say now or any of those complicated processor things that you don't need to know.

434
00:29:57,756 --> 00:30:10,980
Scott: we're gonna talk about what it was Like to be someone building computers in the years Like the late 90s through the current day So the past decade what it's been like as a nerd building computers in terms of processors

435
00:30:11,361 --> 00:30:11,562
Rym: Yep,

436
00:30:11,642 --> 00:30:12,566
Scott: and how it's changed

437
00:30:12,747 --> 00:30:18,855
Rym: because I mean brief brief brief history of the time up till that 386 486. you just bought a computer.

438
00:30:19,056 --> 00:30:19,740
Rym: They were all the same.

439
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:23,312
Scott: You bought a computer and well if you were building you weren't buying a Mac.

440
00:30:23,412 --> 00:30:26,263
Scott: you were buying an IBM and the first IBM that You would buy.

441
00:30:26,363 --> 00:30:33,331
Scott: the first chip that was in the IBM PCs You know was the 8086 and they just kept making it better.

442
00:30:33,391 --> 00:30:36,761
Scott: they came with the 286 and the 386 and the 486 Yep.

443
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:39,289
Rym: Now they're all 86 long story short.

444
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:42,940
Rym: They're all based on the same original core set of instructions.

445
00:30:43,222 --> 00:30:45,460
Rym: We're not gonna get into exactly what that that's a whole nother show.

446
00:30:45,721 --> 00:30:59,300
Rym: but every chip every generation beyond that has been mostly to put it simply an Extension upon that instruction set or some sort of modification to it But for the most part retaining backwards compatibility.

447
00:30:59,782 --> 00:31:12,595
Scott: Yep, so a program written for a 386 will run on your current chip Which in all likelihood is a 686 if you have a computer that's modern, of course They've added instructions instead of going to 786 or 886 or anything like that.

448
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:18,615
Scott: the way they've added instructions They these days is to add things like MMX or 3d now or mx2 or SSE.

449
00:31:19,036 --> 00:31:20,240
Scott: That's how they add instruction.

450
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,770
Rym: Yes now again super oversimplifying.

451
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:25,380
Rym: It's a really cool interesting thing that we'll talk about some other day.

452
00:31:25,542 --> 00:31:32,057
Rym: Yes, yes But right after the 486 era that was pretty much as far as we were concerned.

453
00:31:32,077 --> 00:31:43,120
Rym: as far as geeks like us That was about the point when it became feasible and in fact cost-effective to build your own computer Instead of buying just a computer that came with a chip.

454
00:31:43,381 --> 00:31:46,591
Scott: It also became the time where your chip actually sort of mattered like.

455
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:49,661
Scott: up until then you just got the highest number at 86.

456
00:31:49,661 --> 00:31:54,622
Scott: I mean, no one said oh look I have a better 386 than you do It was.

457
00:31:54,863 --> 00:31:56,347
Scott: there was so few choices.

458
00:31:56,408 --> 00:32:01,664
Scott: It was like a 386 66 or a 486 a hundred And pretty much like once.

459
00:32:01,684 --> 00:32:04,913
Rym: the 486 came out and became reasonably priced.

460
00:32:05,415 --> 00:32:06,578
Rym: You didn't buy 386.

461
00:32:06,578 --> 00:32:07,240
Rym: They just disappeared.

462
00:32:07,541 --> 00:32:10,130
Rym: Yeah, when a 386 came out 286 has just disappeared.

463
00:32:10,651 --> 00:32:16,300
Rym: and the 486. it was so clear What was faster the 486?

464
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,750
Rym: Sx2 was slower than the 486 sx4.

465
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:23,500
Scott: I had the 486 DX for it was a hundred megahertz.

466
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:24,464
Scott: It was awesome.

467
00:32:24,605 --> 00:32:29,713
Rym: Yep, and DX was just better than SX for it had to do with God, I can't get into that.

468
00:32:29,773 --> 00:32:30,500
Scott: It doesn't matter.

469
00:32:31,001 --> 00:32:37,181
Scott: Everything changed when Intel came out with the Pentium one at I think it was at 60 megahertz or 75.

470
00:32:37,181 --> 00:32:39,074
Rym: I don't even remember because I still had a 486 sx2.

471
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,900
Scott: I still had a 486 DX for because it was still better than some of the earliest Pentium ones.

472
00:32:45,342 --> 00:32:47,311
Scott: But when the Pentium one came out, it was a big deal.

473
00:32:47,391 --> 00:32:49,260
Scott: people actually started paying attention to chips.

474
00:32:49,741 --> 00:32:57,821
Scott: They were like, oh the megahertz matter now because that's what Intel advertised with the Pentium one because before then it was just by 486 or a 386.

475
00:32:57,821 --> 00:33:02,516
Rym: Yeah, and the store man might explain DX is faster, but cost a lot more money.

476
00:33:02,918 --> 00:33:04,758
Rym: SX is slower But you won't notice the difference.

477
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:10,546
Scott: hence I bought an SX because I was when the Pentium one came out is when they started saying hey This is X megahertz.

478
00:33:10,747 --> 00:33:13,760
Rym: You see before then better people didn't know what megahertz were there.

479
00:33:13,881 --> 00:33:17,339
Rym: No one would say what's your clock speed except super nerds?

480
00:33:18,281 --> 00:33:20,086
Scott: Super nerds, there was no overclocking.

481
00:33:20,307 --> 00:33:21,210
Rym: Yeah, people just didn't.

482
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:21,812
Rym: well there was.

483
00:33:22,173 --> 00:33:23,878
Rym: there was overclocking that the company.

484
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:28,206
Scott: let you do The turbo buttons on the case.

485
00:33:28,226 --> 00:33:30,494
Rym: Oh god the turbo button the turbo buttons.

486
00:33:30,594 --> 00:33:32,220
Rym: All right, I could do a whole show on the turbo.

487
00:33:35,341 --> 00:33:38,292
Rym: Yeah computers used to have a button called turbo and that's all I'm gonna say.

488
00:33:38,312 --> 00:33:40,359
Rym: so pretty much always left it pushed in.

489
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,510
Scott: Yeah, if it even actually worked it wasn't just for show.

490
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:43,992
Scott: Yeah.

491
00:33:44,112 --> 00:33:46,340
Rym: Well, I un-pushed it once and it immediately crashed.

492
00:33:48,181 --> 00:33:54,826
Rym: But even then now the only metric you had to go on was megahertz and again it was a direct relationship.

493
00:33:55,087 --> 00:33:57,579
Rym: the more megahertz the faster your chip was.

494
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:02,760
Rym: and Also, there was really only one company making chips and that was Intel.

495
00:34:03,011 --> 00:34:14,161
Scott: Yep You would get an Intel Pentium chip as soon as the Intel beat out the plain old for I mean Intel made a lot of The 486 is - but as soon as the Pentiums were out, you're pretty much Pentium was released in 1993.

496
00:34:14,161 --> 00:34:15,626
Scott: Yeah, they sort of had a monopoly.

497
00:34:15,646 --> 00:34:17,934
Scott: it was like which Pentium chip are you gonna get?

498
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:19,699
Scott: you didn't have much of a choice.

499
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:26,009
Scott: I mean you could get a Cyrix like, you know 586 but it was basically just crap for any.

500
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:32,714
Scott: you would only get it if you were super nerdy or Poor or I don't know but everyone just got a Pentium chip.

501
00:34:32,754 --> 00:34:33,136
Scott: That was it.

502
00:34:33,496 --> 00:34:40,520
Rym: Pentium was the way Yep, and while there were other chips available like the k5 you see we're AMD and we're talking.

503
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,009
Rym: This is gonna be Intel and AMD and kind of the evolution here.

504
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:50,273
Rym: back then while AMD existed and in fact AMD had made 386's 46 all that stuff as far as consumers were concerned.

505
00:34:50,534 --> 00:34:51,235
Rym: They didn't exist.

506
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:51,818
Rym: No one had a k5.

507
00:34:52,581 --> 00:34:54,210
Scott: No, I didn't even know what a k5 was.

508
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:54,994
Scott: and the k6 came.

509
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:04,443
Scott: I had never heard of AMD until the k6 - yeah me either and somehow there was a k1 through k5 K61.

510
00:35:04,924 --> 00:35:18,684
Rym: Yeah, there's actually a really interesting story about how AMD which is advanced micro devices Came to be and how they competed with Intel how they constantly sued Intel for antitrust and how they won in a bunch of places like Japan and

511
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:29,040
Scott: how now somehow against this seeming Monopoly of desktop PC processors at least in the United States where we lived by Intel and their Pentium chip.

512
00:35:29,482 --> 00:35:32,819
Scott: AMD did really well and is still doing relatively well.

513
00:35:33,402 --> 00:35:34,265
Scott: So and of amazing.

514
00:35:34,425 --> 00:35:39,242
Rym: but even that back then if you built a computer yourself, you got an Intel Pentium Mm-hmm.

515
00:35:39,784 --> 00:35:49,979
Rym: It wasn't until the mid and late 90s like the middling late 90s that Building computers became more than just buy the chip you can afford put it in a motherboard you can afford.

516
00:35:49,999 --> 00:35:54,061
Scott: Yep I mean in 1999, I think I built the Pentium 3 450.

517
00:35:54,061 --> 00:35:59,036
Rym: Yeah, I had a Pentium 200 and then right before I went to RIT.

518
00:35:59,136 --> 00:35:59,919
Rym: I built a k7 system.

519
00:36:00,581 --> 00:36:04,640
Scott: Yeah, I mean the Pentium one was the hot shit when it was out, but it just basically kept trucking on.

520
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,454
Scott: It was the Pentium 2 was just more and better.

521
00:36:06,474 --> 00:36:07,220
Scott: They added MMX.

522
00:36:07,361 --> 00:36:08,329
Scott: It was just more and better.

523
00:36:08,349 --> 00:36:09,418
Scott: you had to you know.

524
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:15,640
Scott: Now the chips just kept getting crazy faster crazy faster and your only choice was the newest best Pentium.

525
00:36:16,162 --> 00:36:17,889
Scott: I mean by the time the Pentium 3 was out.

526
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:23,489
Scott: when I bought that 450 the choices are basically Pentium 3 350 Pentium 3 450 Pentium 3 500. that was the choice.

527
00:36:23,509 --> 00:36:41,060
Rym: So in AMD released the k6 which had somewhat comparable performance to the to the Pentium chips that would have been put at the same level and they weren't as fast as Pentium chips.

528
00:36:41,541 --> 00:36:45,775
Rym: I mean while I say similar performance, they were definitely nowhere near as fast as Pentium chips.

529
00:36:46,276 --> 00:36:48,892
Rym: However, they were Substantially cheaper.

530
00:36:49,378 --> 00:36:53,047
Scott: Yep I mean it wasn't as fast But for a lot less money.

531
00:36:53,067 --> 00:36:56,802
Scott: if you were building the computer because no one sold a computer with a k6 in it forget About that.

532
00:36:57,284 --> 00:37:04,873
Scott: you could get a computer working that could do some stuff For a lot less money and you wouldn't have to buy a Pentium chip.

533
00:37:05,114 --> 00:37:05,997
Rym: and I knew a few people.

534
00:37:06,038 --> 00:37:06,640
Rym: I started to read.

535
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,769
Rym: People were using these k6.

536
00:37:07,869 --> 00:37:09,240
Rym: is the k6 to the case?

537
00:37:09,401 --> 00:37:14,622
Scott: I didn't really pay attention to them until when I bought my computer in 99 and you know I got.

538
00:37:14,702 --> 00:37:16,613
Scott: I subscribed a computer shopper for a year.

539
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:19,569
Scott: we could do a whole episode of computer shop God, but it had.

540
00:37:19,669 --> 00:37:20,112
Scott: it's a big.

541
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:21,540
Scott: it used to be this big phone book.

542
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:27,665
Scott: It's a magazine that still exists now as an old magazine, but a computer shopper used to be this inch thick gigantic thing.

543
00:37:27,967 --> 00:37:39,398
Scott: that cost like a dollar two dollars and It would have basically half of it was article not even half of it like 20 pages as articles and the rest was ads for computer stuff because you didn't have Newegg to go to.

544
00:37:40,302 --> 00:37:49,952
Scott: so you'd go in there and some people were advertising the k6 - and the k6 - was Almost as good as the Pentium threes of the time.

545
00:37:50,013 --> 00:37:50,233
Scott: Yeah.

546
00:37:50,354 --> 00:37:55,739
Rym: Yep while they weren't as fast They were definitely budget processors and they had some problems.

547
00:37:56,781 --> 00:37:58,368
Rym: I'd had a lot of people who'd used them.

548
00:37:58,388 --> 00:38:01,360
Rym: they had problems overheating or compatibility occasionally.

549
00:38:01,801 --> 00:38:03,526
Rym: Sometimes the motherboards weren't so great.

550
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:11,989
Rym: There were all sorts of issues with them, but in terms of dollars per unit performance They beat Intel by some stupid amount.

551
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:17,727
Scott: Yeah, I mean the k6 - you know, it wasn't stupidly popular anything but a lot of people actually bought it.

552
00:38:17,868 --> 00:38:31,026
Scott: and there I kept seeing more and more ads for it and Someone must have been buying these things Me because I was still using my Pentium three because you could build a computer that was almost as fast as an equivalent Pentium computer For hundreds and hundreds of dollars.

553
00:38:31,046 --> 00:38:33,153
Rym: less money dollars less money.

554
00:38:33,173 --> 00:38:35,080
Rym: That was a wonderful construction.

555
00:38:35,261 --> 00:38:39,459
Scott: I mean I paid like hundreds of dollars to that Pentium three in the k6 - was like a hundred.

556
00:38:39,479 --> 00:38:41,787
Rym: and god I paid some stupid amount of money for that Pentium 200.

557
00:38:41,787 --> 00:38:47,443
Rym: Yeah, Pentium - 200 so Athlon k7.

558
00:38:47,865 --> 00:38:52,340
Rym: This is the error that a lot of people are familiar with because this is when there was actually a choice.

559
00:38:52,682 --> 00:39:00,114
Rym: in fact, this is when the industry really got turned upside down and AMD started doing better than in town.

560
00:39:00,134 --> 00:39:01,140
Scott: Yeah, basically what happened?

561
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,375
Scott: I remember the summer before.

562
00:39:03,395 --> 00:39:05,265
Scott: all right Was it the summer before?

563
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,855
Scott: it was when I went to RIT for college and careers.

564
00:39:07,896 --> 00:39:09,768
Scott: the first time I went to RIT I wasn't a student.

565
00:39:09,789 --> 00:39:10,880
Scott: It was August 1999.

566
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,660
Scott: I was thinking about being a student and the my roommate of two days.

567
00:39:14,861 --> 00:39:16,105
Scott: I forget who the guy was who?

568
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:18,233
Scott: just some guy but he liked computers.

569
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,317
Scott: and we talked about computers.

570
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:35,120
Scott: and he was talking about the K7 which was the Athlon the first Athlon and how all indicators showed that it was probably going to be badass and Not suck like the k62 sucked and it still be cheaper than the Pentium 3 of the time.

571
00:39:35,601 --> 00:39:38,551
Rym: in fact, then all the compatibility issues were gone.

572
00:39:38,933 --> 00:39:43,469
Rym: the chip was just a badass chip and For the same performance.

573
00:39:43,529 --> 00:39:46,443
Rym: take an Intel chip and the AMD chip that perform Identically.

574
00:39:46,804 --> 00:39:51,380
Rym: the AMD chip was so much less money that only an idiot would have bought the Intel chip.

575
00:39:51,440 --> 00:40:00,299
Rym: There was absolutely no reason for someone building in their own computer back then to buy an Intel chip And this was a complete reversal from the way computers had been forever before.

576
00:40:00,339 --> 00:40:03,015
Scott: that I mean the Athlon was coming and it was hyped up.

577
00:40:03,237 --> 00:40:05,007
Scott: and you know A lot of people didn't believe the hype.

578
00:40:05,288 --> 00:40:07,400
Scott: and then it came and the people who believe the hype bought it.

579
00:40:07,741 --> 00:40:12,237
Scott: And then of course, it was the real deal and it just caught on and kept catching on.

580
00:40:12,398 --> 00:40:20,243
Rym: one year later I built the $4,000 computer using an Athlon K7 800 megahertz processor Mm-hmm.

581
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:25,880
Rym: I used that computer up until near the end of RIT where the motherboard exploded.

582
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,627
Rym: I still have the chip and the chip is still fine.

583
00:40:27,647 --> 00:40:28,551
Rym: The motherboard exploded.

584
00:40:29,133 --> 00:40:30,840
Rym: I had to buy a replacement motherboard.

585
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:33,416
Rym: They didn't sell motherboards that took that chip.

586
00:40:33,759 --> 00:40:35,663
Scott: So I Explain why.

587
00:40:35,884 --> 00:40:36,225
Rym: yes.

588
00:40:36,466 --> 00:40:39,976
Rym: Well, you see chips for the longest time took sockets.

589
00:40:40,197 --> 00:40:41,380
Scott: Well, they went into sockets.

590
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,898
Scott: You know you look at a motherboard and there's the part where the the processor goes.

591
00:40:44,918 --> 00:40:56,840
Scott: now It's a little flat thing and it's sort of a square with a square in the middle and you the chip has a bunch of Pins on the bottom of it and you drop it in and you pull the lever and your chip is now in the motherboard.

592
00:40:57,161 --> 00:41:02,860
Rym: Chips were like that from the dawn of time up until this one little stint and then they went back to that pretty much.

593
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:04,199
Scott: Yeah, that's the way chips are now.

594
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:11,280
Scott: That's the way they used to be but in this one period of time the Pentium threes and the original Athlons They went into slots.

595
00:41:11,481 --> 00:41:12,104
Scott: It looked a lot.

596
00:41:12,164 --> 00:41:15,439
Scott: the place where your chip went looked like a PCI slot.

597
00:41:15,881 --> 00:41:22,968
Scott: only your chip went in there and your chip was on this board and the board was surrounded by plastic.

598
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:25,862
Scott: and that piece of plastic went into this Thing.

599
00:41:25,902 --> 00:41:31,512
Scott: that looked like a PCI slot and it was called for an Athlon It was slot a and for a Pentium it was slot one.

600
00:41:31,733 --> 00:41:33,080
Rym: Yep, and they were mostly identical.

601
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:35,728
Rym: However, they were not compatible at all.

602
00:41:35,889 --> 00:41:38,520
Scott: No, you couldn't put a slot a chip in a slot one motherboard.

603
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:49,207
Rym: now there was also slot two and slot B. slot two was for server special chips from Intel and slot B was nominally for server chips from AMD, but What we're talking about?

604
00:41:49,227 --> 00:41:50,033
Rym: the consumer side?

605
00:41:50,294 --> 00:41:52,093
Rym: suffice to say industry.

606
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:57,060
Rym: people Ignored AMD up until very very recent.

607
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:02,660
Scott: Yeah, pretty much because Intel had a separate line of chips the Xeon which they still have now back there is server ring.

608
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,666
Scott: That's what you bought back.

609
00:42:03,706 --> 00:42:11,517
Rym: Then a Xeon chip was Amazingly Incredibly faster than anything else on the mark also incredibly amazingly expensive.

610
00:42:11,698 --> 00:42:13,598
Rym: They were thousands of dollars.

611
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:20,840
Scott: The main reason the Xeon was and still is really stupidly powerful is because it has so much cash on the chip.

612
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,150
Scott: It had megabytes of cash on the chip.

613
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:30,263
Rym: This is back in the days when having like 256 K of a tiny little cash was huge Mm-hmm.

614
00:42:30,685 --> 00:42:33,859
Rym: Now the reason they moved to this slot design was twofold.

615
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:39,640
Rym: one It was thought that you could cool chips better because chips were getting really really hot around this time.

616
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,371
Rym: This is when chips there was this huge cuz.

617
00:42:41,391 --> 00:42:54,564
Rym: remember right around the Pentium 400 450 500 550 megahertz times there was this long plateau where chips really weren't getting faster and they weren't getting cheaper either and everything just kind of Stagnated for a while.

618
00:42:54,925 --> 00:42:57,433
Rym: and then suddenly there was this rush with the k7 700 800 megahertz a gigahertz.

619
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:04,120
Scott: Well, the Pentium 3 got up to that fast also, but yeah, it did but the AMD actually got there first.

620
00:43:04,361 --> 00:43:07,472
Rym: Yep, but they started getting really hot as a result.

621
00:43:07,492 --> 00:43:07,692
Rym: Yes.

622
00:43:07,773 --> 00:43:09,840
Scott: This is also when people started overclocking.

623
00:43:10,302 --> 00:43:15,460
Scott: Yeah, people had a Pentium 3 500 and someone else had something else 800.

624
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,029
Scott: They said I can get this up to 800 and they could.

625
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:21,421
Scott: they could get the motherboard to go from 100 megahertz to 133.

626
00:43:21,421 --> 00:43:27,840
Scott: They could up the multiplier by one and people were trying to get more and more out of their chips And thus they were get started.

627
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:33,600
Scott: This is where all the people started getting crazy cooling devices and water cooling and this is the era where all those things began.

628
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,334
Rym: Everywhere overclock because back then you got substantial performance increase.

629
00:43:38,354 --> 00:43:40,060
Scott: Yeah, I overclocked that Pentium 3.

630
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:52,583
Scott: I basically upped it by one bit one bit one bit one bit at a time until it crashed and then I went back down One bit and I was able to make that computer last a lot longer than it would have lasted Otherwise, yes,

631
00:43:52,844 --> 00:43:59,320
Rym: I overclocked my 800 megahertz pretty much at to the limit I could overclock it without losing stability.

632
00:43:59,481 --> 00:44:08,540
Scott: It helped that at the time I was using the a bit bx6 r2 motherboards days one of the most stable motherboard ever Regardless if now it's too slow to do anything.

633
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:13,400
Scott: But the Intel BX motherboard chipset is the greatest motherboard chipset to ever exist.

634
00:44:13,762 --> 00:44:16,513
Scott: You could do anything to it and it would just keep working.

635
00:44:16,574 --> 00:44:17,377
Scott: It still works now.

636
00:44:17,417 --> 00:44:18,060
Scott: I've still got it.

637
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,026
Scott: I'm never getting rid of that thing.

638
00:44:20,092 --> 00:44:20,877
Scott: I think I still got it.

639
00:44:21,343 --> 00:44:24,749
Rym: but Remember we talked about how suddenly megahertz became the issue.

640
00:44:24,789 --> 00:44:28,401
Rym: way back people realized that oh the higher that number is the faster the chip is.

641
00:44:28,782 --> 00:44:39,351
Rym: well AMD and Intel kind of got into this megahertz race where they were both tracked kind of fighting to see who got to Gigahertz first and also to try to win the public over with.

642
00:44:39,632 --> 00:44:40,736
Rym: look our chips are faster.

643
00:44:40,776 --> 00:44:45,430
Rym: No, look our chips are faster Mm-hmm, and this is pretty much as a result of this.

644
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:47,236
Rym: They weren't streamlining things.

645
00:44:47,416 --> 00:44:48,540
Rym: They weren't worried about power.

646
00:44:48,641 --> 00:44:51,965
Rym: They're worried about speed raw Unbridled speed.

647
00:44:52,245 --> 00:44:54,674
Rym: so chips got hotter and hotter and hotter and use more and more.

648
00:44:54,714 --> 00:44:56,440
Rym: power needed more and more cooling.

649
00:44:56,781 --> 00:45:02,520
Rym: You could put cooling on both sides with these slots also, and this is probably the more important reason.

650
00:45:03,243 --> 00:45:06,500
Rym: This is when RAM and registers started getting a lot cheaper.

651
00:45:07,002 --> 00:45:16,095
Rym: like there was this huge dropout in the RAM market around this time and Suddenly it went from having some little amount of RAM to you Just buy as much RAM as your motherboard could take and it was so cheap.

652
00:45:16,115 --> 00:45:16,779
Rym: You didn't even care.

653
00:45:17,343 --> 00:45:19,999
Scott: Oh, I think it's because the RAM speeds didn't really go up.

654
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:29,217
Scott: I know is PC 100 and PC 133 for the longest time and DDR wasn't there yet and People had just they.

655
00:45:29,278 --> 00:45:38,814
Scott: you know They had not changed the RAM technology and so long so long like a year so that they had just met Factories churning this stuff out like crazy and the price went down.

656
00:45:38,994 --> 00:45:40,300
Rym: RAM was dirt cheap.

657
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:41,042
Rym: In fact, I had.

658
00:45:41,243 --> 00:45:45,736
Rym: we have like four gigabytes worth of that old RAM just like a lot of PC 100 and PC 133 RAM.

659
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,108
Scott: I don't know what sticks work and which ones don't.

660
00:45:49,168 --> 00:45:57,293
Rym: I have a full two gigs from my old computer because when I got the New motherboard to replace the busted one I had to get a DDR motherboard because they didn't make motherboards.

661
00:45:57,313 --> 00:45:59,662
Rym: that took the old stuff and took the chip I wanted.

662
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:07,380
Rym: so I had all this RAM laid around by all new RAM, but because this was cheaper They started putting a lot more cash on processors.

663
00:46:07,801 --> 00:46:12,577
Rym: And in fact, they had level 1 level 2 and in many cases level 3 caches.

664
00:46:12,898 --> 00:46:14,642
Rym: not gonna get it 486.

665
00:46:14,642 --> 00:46:20,139
Scott: the the l2 cache was little chips 128 K little bug ships you would put in the motherboard.

666
00:46:20,219 --> 00:46:21,323
Scott: Yep I was crazy.

667
00:46:21,363 --> 00:46:26,680
Rym: They started putting these extra caches on boards that were connected that were in this slot thing.

668
00:46:26,963 --> 00:46:28,240
Rym: There wouldn't be room in a socket.

669
00:46:28,641 --> 00:46:33,540
Rym: Inside of that plastic slot was a little board that had a bunch of caches on it and all sorts of circuitry.

670
00:46:34,325 --> 00:46:38,004
Rym: now technology marched on and Very rapidly.

671
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:48,700
Rym: it became more cost-effective more feasible and better to just put that RAM Right on the die or near the die and you didn't have to bother with these boards anymore and slots just disappeared.

672
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,724
Rym: They'll probably never come back.

673
00:46:50,085 --> 00:46:51,953
Scott: No, I think the slot is pretty much dead.

674
00:46:52,555 --> 00:46:53,720
Scott: It's pretty much sockets forever.

675
00:46:54,235 --> 00:47:00,454
Rym: Yep In fact, I bought one slot and by the time my computer died There were no more slots and I had to buy a socket.

676
00:47:00,474 --> 00:47:01,752
Scott: That's the same way It was for me.

677
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:07,416
Rym: Now people sold these things where you could connect a slot into a socket and those things never fucking.

678
00:47:07,456 --> 00:47:10,606
Scott: people also sold things Sockets into slots.

679
00:47:10,767 --> 00:47:16,016
Scott: those didn't work either but they were just stupid and Unnecessary because a motherboard was cheap.

680
00:47:16,439 --> 00:47:25,750
Rym: now This was the last time I paid attention because back then it was just duh by the highest megahertz AMD k7 that you can afford the bed like you.

681
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:28,980
Rym: try to get the optimal performance price ratio and that was it.

682
00:47:29,261 --> 00:47:38,780
Scott: Well, I think what happened next was you sort of had the Athlon and the Pentium 4 and they just kept fighting each other For years and years and years getting faster and faster with not much changing.

683
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:41,952
Scott: I mean the Pentium 4 added the hyper threading which is just bullshit.

684
00:47:42,454 --> 00:47:43,659
Scott: It didn't really help you that much.

685
00:47:44,785 --> 00:47:47,100
Scott: The Athlon just kept getting faster and faster.

686
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:51,435
Scott: They add you know The Pentium would add a feature like SSE and then the Athlon would add the 3d.

687
00:47:51,476 --> 00:47:54,192
Rym: now now This is what I find really interesting.

688
00:47:54,233 --> 00:48:01,000
Rym: for the longest time AMD chips had the percent there's the perception that they weren't as elegant or efficient.

689
00:48:01,401 --> 00:48:05,714
Rym: They were just raw power and a lot faster while and they just plugged through.

690
00:48:05,954 --> 00:48:11,311
Rym: well Intel's were slower But more elegant and as a result were much more powerful.

691
00:48:11,552 --> 00:48:30,420
Rym: and this really started coming to play with the Pentium 4 era When suddenly it got reversed and the Pentium 4's were just higher megahertz higher megahertz but the AMD's got equivalent performance with less megahertz and AMD actually started naming their chips no longer based on megahertz but based on the number that they made up.

692
00:48:30,781 --> 00:48:32,346
Rym: It was like the equivalent clock speed.

693
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:49,740
Scott: like for example, my chip and my computer right now is an Athlon XP 2500. supposedly that means according to AMD at least in their marketing that that is roughly equivalent in speed to a 2.5 gigahertz Pentium 4 as where it's actually only a 1.8 gigahertz chip.

694
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:52,471
Rym: Yeah, they never said that straight up to not get in trouble.

695
00:48:52,511 --> 00:48:53,334
Scott: But that's heavily.

696
00:48:53,816 --> 00:48:54,860
Scott: that's what they meant.

697
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:55,944
Scott: That's the reason they did it?

698
00:48:56,004 --> 00:49:02,490
Scott: because they didn't want people to think hey this AMD is 1.8 Gigahertz and this Pentium 4 is 2.5 gigahertz.

699
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:07,080
Scott: Yeah, and in reality, okay, if you do the math The Athlon was actually a faster chip.

700
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:12,640
Scott: So putting the lower number on it is bad for marketing because people think it's slower who were stupid when it's actually faster.

701
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:20,933
Rym: See the chip companies have put so much marketing power into getting people to understand Megahertz equals speed that suddenly this was no longer the case.

702
00:49:21,174 --> 00:49:24,927
Scott: Well, no longer the case for Intel across different chips.

703
00:49:25,188 --> 00:49:33,259
Scott: Yeah, you know when they when they did when Intel originally had that marketing It was so people would know that the higher megahertz Pentiums that cost more were better than the lower.

704
00:49:33,279 --> 00:49:34,103
Scott: her better It's Pentiums.

705
00:49:34,184 --> 00:49:35,149
Rym: and then it was true.

706
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:43,480
Rym: because they were the same chip just one was faster And he took advantage of that by making chips that were higher megahertz than Intel and then winning out in terms of the geek market.

707
00:49:43,841 --> 00:49:47,960
Scott: Yep, it didn't help that the general architecture of the Pentium 4 was black.

708
00:49:48,683 --> 00:49:52,659
Rym: Yeah, the Pentium 4 suffice to say was not a terribly great leap.

709
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:54,587
Rym: Yes in performance or power.

710
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:57,579
Scott: so that era is now ended in the past year or so.

711
00:49:57,981 --> 00:50:07,959
Rym: Yeah, I mean think for most of the time that people who I guess listen to five last like three or four years built computers Like that golden era of building computers from back in our young days.

712
00:50:08,702 --> 00:50:11,111
Scott: AMD was like 2001 through 2005.

713
00:50:11,111 --> 00:50:13,660
Rym: AMD was the undisputed king of building your own PC.

714
00:50:13,781 --> 00:50:15,259
Rym: There was no reason to get an Intel chip.

715
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:16,564
Scott: well people got Intel chips.

716
00:50:16,604 --> 00:50:19,253
Scott: if they bought a pre-built computer like a Dell yeah couldn't.

717
00:50:19,294 --> 00:50:20,899
Scott: sometimes you can get an AMD but not often.

718
00:50:20,919 --> 00:50:24,513
Scott: and Some people got an Intel because it is true.

719
00:50:24,553 --> 00:50:26,100
Scott: Remember that demo video we watched.

720
00:50:26,242 --> 00:50:27,220
Scott: It's absolutely true.

721
00:50:27,682 --> 00:50:34,435
Scott: If you had an Intel chip and you took the heatsink off right it would just Stop working and then you put the heatsink back on.

722
00:50:34,455 --> 00:50:35,340
Scott: it would start working again.

723
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:38,633
Rym: If you took the heatsink off an AMD, it would just set on fire.

724
00:50:38,793 --> 00:50:40,520
Rym: literally literally it would catch fire.

725
00:50:40,682 --> 00:50:41,579
Scott: Smoke would just come out.

726
00:50:41,901 --> 00:50:53,340
Rym: In fact, if you bumped your heatsink somehow while you're using an AMD and it was at all loaded the processor in terms of use Your processor would be broken and irreparably destroyed within seconds.

727
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:58,821
Scott: There's a famous video that we the one I'm just talking about where they were playing Quake 3 on a Pentium 4.

728
00:50:58,821 --> 00:50:59,928
Scott: They take the heatsink off.

729
00:51:00,189 --> 00:51:02,080
Scott: Quake 3 slows down to zero FPS.

730
00:51:02,582 --> 00:51:08,200
Scott: They put the heatsink back on while the computer's running and Quake 3 jumps back up to full FPS.

731
00:51:08,662 --> 00:51:11,493
Scott: They do the same thing to the AMD windows crashes.

732
00:51:11,573 --> 00:51:13,320
Scott: The screen goes blank and the chip sets on fire.

733
00:51:13,742 --> 00:51:32,967
Scott: So the Pentium 4 while being less efficient costing more money Not being quite as fast as the AMD per dollar spent generally a bad purchasing decision when building a computer did have some advantages in some areas such as like power consumption and Not setting on fire when you take the heatsink off

734
00:51:32,987 --> 00:51:35,938
Rym: because you see the brief history of these two companies.

735
00:51:36,018 --> 00:51:36,239
Rym: Is that?

736
00:51:36,741 --> 00:51:49,996
Rym: AMD was the underdog crap little company that kind of pulled through and made chips as best it could and They generally didn't have a lot of R&D money and they had to use other relatively less.

737
00:51:50,036 --> 00:51:59,217
Rym: They're making lots of money Yeah, but for an up until the k7 days They didn't make a lot of money and they didn't have a lot of money to invest into R&D and any investment They made was a huge risk.

738
00:52:00,261 --> 00:52:04,804
Rym: Intel meanwhile was the world powerhouse Monopoly of chip making.

739
00:52:04,984 --> 00:52:11,442
Rym: yeah Intel had more money to put into R&D than AMD and all the Intel Competitors can.

740
00:52:11,583 --> 00:52:16,900
Scott: it's why it was so amazing that when AMD came up in the first place as actually seriously competing.

741
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:17,700
Scott: It was so amazing.

742
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:23,460
Scott: It would be like if some other operating system came up and seriously competed with Windows and actually beat it for a time.

743
00:52:23,821 --> 00:52:30,990
Scott: I mean as opposed to just you know, Mac and Linux which are still while they have You know market presence in terms of visual.

744
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:31,713
Scott: this there's still.

745
00:52:31,733 --> 00:52:37,875
Rym: they got nothing in the case seven days At least and it was my perspective too because I didn't know a lot about Intel back then.

746
00:52:38,116 --> 00:52:40,909
Rym: now that I've worked for IBM And I'm older and wiser.

747
00:52:40,989 --> 00:52:45,160
Rym: I know a lot more about this and I see how my My optimism was misguided.

748
00:52:45,842 --> 00:52:48,709
Rym: AMD was beating Intel as far as any geek could see.

749
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:54,192
Scott: their chips were better and cheaper in terms of geeks building computers Home PCs, etc.

750
00:52:54,233 --> 00:52:54,334
Scott: Etc.

751
00:52:54,920 --> 00:53:05,353
Rym: now even for OEM stuff the chips were better and cheaper and the a lot of people thought that people didn't use AMD and OEMs because it deals with Intel which was partly true.

752
00:53:05,434 --> 00:53:09,849
Rym: Intel has been caught doing Trust-like things many times.

753
00:53:09,889 --> 00:53:11,094
Rym: Intel is not your friends.

754
00:53:11,415 --> 00:53:17,900
Rym: No, not really to put it very But neither is AMD even though they really like to pretend they are yep, but kind of like Nintendo.

755
00:53:18,383 --> 00:53:19,087
Rym: Yeah, we're your friend.

756
00:53:19,127 --> 00:53:20,314
Rym: Give us the money for the Wii.

757
00:53:20,334 --> 00:53:21,179
Rym: games come next week.

758
00:53:22,082 --> 00:53:23,387
Scott: Games come next week year.

759
00:53:23,407 --> 00:53:25,133
Scott: We clean air in Japanese.

760
00:53:25,154 --> 00:53:25,515
Scott: Yes.

761
00:53:25,695 --> 00:53:26,137
Scott: Yes.

762
00:53:26,237 --> 00:53:32,239
Rym: Yes But AMD in terms of I mean you could buy the chips were awesome and stupid.

763
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:35,040
Rym: awesome But AMD was not a mature company.

764
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:42,180
Rym: They didn't have this tradition of engineering quality and they didn't have the R&D and they didn't have the massive fabs that they own.

765
00:53:42,742 --> 00:53:48,219
Rym: They couldn't put out enough chips to meet the demand of the OEMs for one and two.

766
00:53:48,961 --> 00:53:58,619
Rym: while we thought that AMD had won the war and Intel wasn't doing well Intel was actually losing money on their Pentium 4s for a while and things weren't looking so great for it.

767
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:03,660
Rym: They really lose money in the Pentium 4s in terms of R&D versus money made in the early days.

768
00:54:03,921 --> 00:54:04,586
Scott: yeah, well what?

769
00:54:04,647 --> 00:54:05,090
Scott: eventually?

770
00:54:05,131 --> 00:54:10,660
Scott: what ended up happening is Intel has a lot of R&D teams and they had an R&D team in Israel.

771
00:54:11,102 --> 00:54:20,699
Rym: And those guys are real smart because they basically saved Intel from doom Yep, because Intel kind of disappeared from the face of geeks making computers and everyone just ignored him.

772
00:54:20,981 --> 00:54:24,445
Scott: Well, it didn't completely disappear was still there But it just it wasn't.

773
00:54:24,505 --> 00:54:25,307
Scott: it wasn't smart.

774
00:54:25,568 --> 00:54:29,680
Scott: now to get like if you looked at the like steam always does that thing where they?

775
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:32,471
Scott: See what hardware you're running and they do a survey and they show you the results.

776
00:54:32,973 --> 00:54:40,940
Scott: and I remember at the time it was like 60/40 AMD Intel or something like that and AMD usage was going up and going up and going up.

777
00:54:41,221 --> 00:54:46,720
Rym: But these Israeli engineers were very quietly just developing new architectures and new chips.

778
00:54:46,901 --> 00:54:57,739
Scott: yep, they took what is essentially the architecture of the Pentium 3 and they brought it up to speed and they made the core the core solo and the core duo that you're using right now.

779
00:54:57,759 --> 00:55:08,380
Rym: and When those were announced and then when they came out it Really kind of flipped everything back around because these chips are in terms of megahertz a lot slower than AMD chips.

780
00:55:09,002 --> 00:55:09,585
Scott: My work.

781
00:55:09,745 --> 00:55:11,472
Scott: I have this Dell Optiplex something.

782
00:55:11,513 --> 00:55:13,260
Scott: something has a core to duo in it.

783
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,690
Scott: It's it's it's almost as good as it gets.

784
00:55:16,293 --> 00:55:23,617
Scott: each of those two cores are 1.8 gigahertz each the same as my AMD XP 2500 the same exact clock speed.

785
00:55:23,797 --> 00:55:30,200
Scott: Yep yet Comparatively my computer is slow as shit and the thing at work is stupid fast.

786
00:55:30,704 --> 00:55:38,217
Rym: The core twos are Faster in terms of getting work done than the intent in the AMD chips megahertz per megahertz.

787
00:55:38,598 --> 00:55:42,371
Rym: in addition They're a lot cleaner a lot more efficient.

788
00:55:42,391 --> 00:55:43,656
Rym: They use a lot less power.

789
00:55:43,877 --> 00:55:51,460
Rym: They're a lot cooler They're a lot more reliable and the kicker they're not really that much more expensive.

790
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,451
Scott: See they are still more expensive.

791
00:55:53,571 --> 00:55:55,120
Scott: AMD has a line of also.

792
00:55:55,401 --> 00:55:58,355
Scott: You know their AMD has been keeping pace as best they can.

793
00:55:58,375 --> 00:56:01,187
Scott: they have the x2 chips Which are dual core AMD's.

794
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:06,544
Scott: they came out with all their 64-bit stuff, which is Sort of good sort of bad.

795
00:56:06,604 --> 00:56:14,860
Scott: I want to talk about 64-bit stuff now, but it the AMD is ahead in the 64-bit race Needless to say but it's not that important.

796
00:56:16,361 --> 00:56:21,260
Scott: And they have their FX line, which is the stupid fast AMD's, but those are expensive.

797
00:56:21,421 --> 00:56:23,554
Scott: So you're not really making the price performance win.

798
00:56:23,594 --> 00:56:24,620
Rym: They're not really that expensive.

799
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:32,966
Rym: The thing is up until very recently and this is why I keep oscillating back and forth between Intel and AMD And I'm still not sure what I'm gonna end up with though I want a core to.

800
00:56:33,549 --> 00:56:53,644
Rym: the core twos were still a lot more expensive But AMD has recently been slashing their prices repeatedly and AMD chips are so cheap now That it's harkening back to the old days where while the core two is a far superior chip in almost all respects You can get a chip that's almost as fast for a ludicrously Cheaper price.

801
00:56:53,864 --> 00:56:54,628
Scott: it's like right now.

802
00:56:54,708 --> 00:56:57,580
Scott: You can get a core to do it for like what 300 bucks something like that.

803
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:03,260
Rym: Well it currently and it has been for the last week and a half the E6600 core 2 which is the sweet spot.

804
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:09,721
Rym: That is the best chip on the curve of performance of the core tube right now in terms of price is three hundred and eight Dollars.

805
00:57:10,183 --> 00:57:14,454
Scott: all right how much is the roughly equivalent AMD x2?

806
00:57:14,695 --> 00:57:15,437
Rym: it was at least $120 less.

807
00:57:17,662 --> 00:57:19,613
Scott: See it's like two-thirds the cost.

808
00:57:19,713 --> 00:57:20,840
Scott: is it a third slower?

809
00:57:21,523 --> 00:57:21,905
Rym: Well they hit.

810
00:57:22,227 --> 00:57:31,040
Rym: it also gets complicated in that the AMD FX's and these new to AMD chips do outperform the core twos on certain specific tasks.

811
00:57:31,321 --> 00:57:43,980
Rym: yeah, however usually these are very computationally intensive benchmark kind of things and Real world use cases like running a game like supreme commander the core twos kick the AMD's asses.

812
00:57:44,523 --> 00:57:51,800
Scott: Well, I don't have a lot of experience with new AMD chips But I have experience with the core to do at work, and it's plenty fast.

813
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,525
Scott: I wouldn't be upset if I had one.

814
00:57:53,645 --> 00:57:54,788
Rym: the core solo.

815
00:57:54,848 --> 00:57:58,478
Rym: That's in our Mac mini megahertz wise is pathetically slow.

816
00:57:58,759 --> 00:58:01,507
Rym: however It's really fast.

817
00:58:01,587 --> 00:58:03,175
Rym: all these video without skipping.

818
00:58:03,195 --> 00:58:04,300
Scott: I mean I have a core.

819
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:07,393
Scott: I have the slowest core solo imaginable in my new laptop.

820
00:58:07,433 --> 00:58:08,096
Scott: It's a core solo u1400.

821
00:58:09,401 --> 00:58:12,070
Scott: It's one point two gigahertz ultra low voltage.

822
00:58:12,491 --> 00:58:17,747
Scott: It's the weakest possible core solo and It gets the job done.

823
00:58:17,788 --> 00:58:19,576
Scott: I mean I can't play 3d games on it.

824
00:58:20,078 --> 00:58:20,460
Scott: that well.

825
00:58:20,521 --> 00:58:22,022
Scott: I mean, maybe I could play half-life 1.

826
00:58:22,022 --> 00:58:25,268
Scott: I haven't tried But it can play a video without skipping.

827
00:58:25,308 --> 00:58:29,979
Scott: it can web browse it can word process and the CPU is never the bottleneck in any of those cases.

828
00:58:30,682 --> 00:58:37,579
Rym: So basically the market has gone back and forth and now I'm not sure where I should be Because everything is still in flux.

829
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:46,284
Rym: April 22nd according to various sources is the day that Intel is supposed to announce new chips and Lower the prices of current chips.

830
00:58:46,866 --> 00:58:49,575
Rym: a day is coming soon, and if those announcements happen.

831
00:58:49,656 --> 00:58:50,980
Rym: I might just buy a computer immediately.

832
00:58:51,482 --> 00:58:52,466
Scott: We'll see what happens.

833
00:58:52,707 --> 00:58:55,840
Rym: Yeah, that was based on a leaked memo, so we'll see what actually happens.

834
00:58:56,161 --> 00:58:59,690
Scott: Just let it be known everyone out there who you know didn't live through all this.

835
00:59:00,051 --> 00:59:02,959
Scott: Pentium Intel AMD Athlon BS.

836
00:59:03,962 --> 00:59:13,080
Scott: it's been a back and forth over the years and Things are getting interesting right about now, and you should probably pay attention if you plan on buying computers.

837
00:59:13,581 --> 00:59:23,920
Rym: Yeah, because pretty much the chip industry it seems to go a whole bunch of building and then it'll hit a sweet spot and Sit there for a while, and it's like the perfect time to buy a new computer.

838
00:59:24,202 --> 00:59:27,540
Rym: You'll get the most bang for your buck, and then it'll be stable for a while.

839
00:59:27,901 --> 00:59:34,659
Rym: And then suddenly there'll be this new rush and the current rush is just about to end and there's no new rush coming.

840
00:59:34,699 --> 00:59:44,460
Rym: until Intel is announced and if these come to fruition The next round of chip advancements are going to be more than like the previous several chip advancement.

841
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:46,887
Scott: Well, they keep talking about some stuff That's kind of silly.

842
00:59:46,987 --> 00:59:57,767
Scott: like they talk about these quad core things Then it's like all right now You're you know they get into this realm where they talk about chips that is so expensive and so crazy that they're not Practical for a personal computer.

843
00:59:57,787 --> 00:59:59,694
Scott: It's like no one at home is well.

844
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:01,300
Scott: That's a quad core.

845
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:05,918
Rym: That's only because not only most software does not take advantage of multiple cores.

846
01:00:05,938 --> 01:00:12,440
Rym: very well I mean supreme commander, which is a very computationally intensive game uses two cores at best.

847
01:00:12,982 --> 01:00:16,976
Scott: Yeah, the quad core is not necessary for home, but that's not what I'm talking about.

848
01:00:17,076 --> 01:00:31,740
Rym: Intel is basically Theoretically going to be able to push the clock speeds of the current type of chips the current core twos that are already Wickedly fast at like two gigahertz up to three and four gigahertz with just a snap of a fingers.

849
01:00:32,281 --> 01:00:35,932
Rym: We'll see about that that these announcements are coming, and it doesn't look like this.

850
01:00:35,952 --> 01:00:38,540
Rym: technology is going to be available until December January.

851
01:00:39,461 --> 01:00:40,980
Rym: Yeah, that's so up in the air.

852
01:00:41,061 --> 01:00:53,257
Rym: I can't really say a date But there's gonna be a long sweet spot because things are starting to level out and I think in the next few weeks in fact There's going to be a sweet spot buying time And I think the next sweet spot is gonna be next year on February.

853
01:00:53,398 --> 01:00:57,240
Rym: well That's total speculation based on Rym reading a bunch of articles for the past month.

854
01:00:57,481 --> 01:01:02,563
Scott: Yeah, well if AMD doesn't come out with some sort of new chip soon they might It might be over.

855
01:01:02,583 --> 01:01:03,347
Scott: because see that's really.

856
01:01:03,367 --> 01:01:07,965
Scott: what's going on here is if any company ever gets Enough of a lead.

857
01:01:07,985 --> 01:01:12,760
Scott: see the only reason AMD was able to get in in the first place is because Intel was lagging.

858
01:01:13,222 --> 01:01:18,260
Scott: They didn't you know advance the technology fast enough and AMD was able to go faster with them.

859
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:20,378
Scott: It's all an R&D race Yep.

860
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:28,545
Rym: So Intel always has the advantage in R&D and they just sat pet Made something amazing and then threw it out to muck up everyone's world Plan on the head.

861
01:01:28,585 --> 01:01:31,737
Scott: coming out with these core duos and things it was sort of hooray.

862
01:01:31,777 --> 01:01:37,660
Rym: they saved us Yep, but now they're putting a lot of research into making the core twos faster and better.

863
01:01:37,882 --> 01:01:39,700
Rym: Yeah, and I don't know what AMD is doing.

864
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:43,680
Rym: I haven't seen any major press releases from them that interested me in a while.

865
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,598
Scott: Yeah, most of the things I see from AMD now our prices are going down.

866
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,160
Rym: They're always dropping their prices while Intel is up in their performance.

867
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:54,800
Scott: Yeah, they're doing stuff with ATI but not much stuff with the the main Athlon action.

868
01:01:54,920 --> 01:02:01,740
Scott: But uh, it's always a big race because as soon as one company gets ahead enough of the other company, that'll be it.

869
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:02,262
Scott: It's over.

870
01:02:02,283 --> 01:02:05,720
Scott: because if you can't can't keep up in the R&D race, you're done.

871
01:02:06,261 --> 01:02:13,624
Scott: You can never catch up because everything's patented and if there's no way for you to make a chip fast enough to compete It's just game over.

872
01:02:14,025 --> 01:02:14,406
Scott: you're done.

873
01:02:14,847 --> 01:02:20,944
Rym: I mean, this is why I like China always talked about making the dragon CPU their own Independently developed CPU.

874
01:02:20,965 --> 01:02:25,460
Rym: that wasn't beholden any patents or anything and as far as I've seen that never came to fruition.

875
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:27,952
Scott: Well, I think they made it but it's really slow and useless.

876
01:02:28,072 --> 01:02:29,017
Rym: Yeah, something like that.

877
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:36,665
Rym: Yeah All right, because there was a flood I'm gonna go to bed because I have to get up early enough to check the weather and see if I can actually get to Work tomorrow.

878
01:02:36,705 --> 01:02:37,533
Rym: I just not even bother.

879
01:02:37,553 --> 01:02:38,279
Rym: I might just not go to work.

880
01:02:38,542 --> 01:02:44,556
Scott: I was half asleep all day at work And so I need to go to bed so I don't sleep at work anymore.
