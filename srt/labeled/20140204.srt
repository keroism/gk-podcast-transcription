1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,958
Rym: It's Tuesday, February 4th, 2014.

2
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:11,901
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,162 --> 00:00:13,506
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,606 --> 00:00:15,050
Rym: And this is GeekNights!

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,239
Scott: Tonight, the stakes for the vampires.

6
00:00:20,546 --> 00:00:21,570
Rym: Let's do this!

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,853
Rym: So I see you two have been reading Dr.

8
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:27,639
Rym: McNinja lately.

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,143
Scott: What have I not read?

10
00:00:30,946 --> 00:00:34,819
Scott: What time in the past, say, I don't know, decade, or have I not read Dr.

11
00:00:34,839 --> 00:00:35,080
Scott: McNinja?

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,100
Rym: There was a period of about a month where I just kind of forgot to read it, for whatever reason.

13
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,117
Scott: Thanks to Comic Rocket, I don't miss webcomics really anymore.

14
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,045
Rym: You sound like an ad.

15
00:00:44,407 --> 00:00:46,097
Rym: Thanks to Comic Rocket, I no longer...

16
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,920
Scott: Comic Rocket, you should really work on your mobile support so I could read webcomics on the go.

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,549
Scott: Because it's pretty bad right now.

18
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:54,220
Rym: It barely works.

19
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,820
Rym: I prefer reading my webcomics on big screens because a lot of the ones I read actually have really good art.

20
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,980
Scott: Well, thank you for this Retina iPad mini screen.

21
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:07,033
Rym: Yeah, where the fuck is my Retina monitor?

22
00:01:07,073 --> 00:01:08,097
Rym: I want like a 26 inch Retina monitor.

23
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:11,365
Scott: Dell has 4K ultra sharps.

24
00:01:12,007 --> 00:01:12,990
Scott: The cheap one sucks.

25
00:01:13,271 --> 00:01:14,996
Scott: The expensive one's expensive.

26
00:01:15,297 --> 00:01:16,140
Scott: Really expensive.

27
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,240
Rym: Actually, all I really want is a laptop like the laptop I have, but with a Retina style display.

28
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,840
Scott: You know, I'm going to get a 4K camera if the rumors are true.

29
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:28,410
Scott: It's supposed to be announced Friday according to rumor sites.

30
00:01:28,771 --> 00:01:31,280
Scott: I don't have a 4K screen to check the video, huh?

31
00:01:31,502 --> 00:01:33,260
Rym: You also might have to get a faster computer.

32
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:34,042
Scott: Why?

33
00:01:34,082 --> 00:01:37,080
Scott: My computer's pretty much as close to the fastest computer you can buy.

34
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,560
Rym: It depends on your rendering pipeline and what you're going to do with that video.

35
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,272
Scott: Probably cut it down to 1080p's.

36
00:01:44,442 --> 00:01:46,760
Rym: Actually, I think you can upload higher resolution to YouTube.

37
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:47,628
Scott: You can, but...

38
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,866
Rym: Well, I guess I'll say this.

39
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,680
Rym: If you do that, you'll have to come over here to upload it, I think.

40
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,960
Rym: So, I've been playing a lot of Nidhogg.

41
00:01:58,603 --> 00:02:01,359
Scott: I do not play Nidhogg that often.

42
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:06,660
Rym: Many of you, you probably should have watched our stream on Nidhogg, because we talked about it a lot.

43
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:07,731
Scott: I have a Twitch channel.

44
00:02:07,751 --> 00:02:08,179
Scott: Check it out.

45
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,360
Rym: Yeah, go to Scott's Twitch, watch us playing Nidhogg, and you'll hear our commentary.

46
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,520
Rym: You'll see Scott getting increasingly frustrated and angry.

47
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,805
Scott: Listen, it's airhogged.

48
00:02:15,926 --> 00:02:18,740
Scott: If you played a bunch of Nidhogg, I barely played it.

49
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,360
Scott: I played, like, a couple hours.

50
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,900
Scott: That's a significant amount for a simple game.

51
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,011
Rym: Yep, and now it's too late.

52
00:02:24,032 --> 00:02:24,659
Rym: You'll never catch up.

53
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:30,740
Scott: I could go home and I could play for you, like, all night, and then I would come back and I'd be set, unless you play also all night.

54
00:02:31,182 --> 00:02:33,540
Rym: Nah, you're 100 years too early at this point.

55
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,180
Scott: What?

56
00:02:35,441 --> 00:02:38,520
Rym: So, I've been playing Nidhogg, and there's no one to play with, really.

57
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,018
Rym: Like, I can play with Emily at home and stuff, but I can't, like, play...

58
00:02:41,421 --> 00:02:42,144
Scott: Go to Magfest.

59
00:02:42,165 --> 00:02:43,069
Scott: There'll be someone to play with.

60
00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:45,180
Scott: People even play Magical Drop and Windjammers.

61
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:50,360
Rym: So, every time I've tried to play online, I've joined the matchmaking system, gotten a match right away, and I win.

62
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,020
Rym: And within an hour, I will have driven every single human out of the matchmaking system.

63
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,300
Scott: Well, because it's interesting how that matchmaking system works, as opposed to other games.

64
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:05,520
Scott: It's rather unique, the free online, sort of, public multiplayer mode, right, where it has sort of a queue.

65
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:11,740
Scott: It's more like a ladder, and you work your way up to the top of the ladder, and once you get to the top, pretty much people have to challenge you.

66
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,160
Scott: So, you're just sitting there being challenged over and over again, and if you never lose, you just stay on top.

67
00:03:16,881 --> 00:03:22,000
Scott: And so, if you just keep beating everyone, and you stay on top of the ladder too long, everyone else in the game will slowly quit.

68
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,595
Scott: 'Cause the guy in second place is like, "Fuck

69
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:23,838
Scott: this."

70
00:03:24,424 --> 00:03:25,557
Scott: And the guy in third place is like, "Fuck

71
00:03:25,618 --> 00:03:25,780
Scott: this."

72
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:33,520
Scott: And then, all the other people aren't good enough, you trounce the hell out of them, and you basically just... The person in second place keeps quitting if you keep winning until you're all alone.

73
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,932
Rym: And there's also not that many people in the first place.

74
00:03:35,952 --> 00:03:37,400
Rym: There'll be, like, 10 or 20 people playing.

75
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,940
Scott: Right, so everyone can see that you're just sitting up there, undefeated.

76
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,937
Rym: Basically, every time I play, what happens is, eventually, like, I'll play someone.

77
00:03:45,238 --> 00:03:45,580
Rym: I beat him.

78
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:50,220
Rym: We play for a while, against each other, because other people come in, usually it's just me and one guy.

79
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,066
Rym: Eventually, they rage quit.

80
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:53,513
Rym: From a game.

81
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,200
Rym: Like, it'd be in the middle of a game, they see it's me.

82
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,520
Scott: Nidhogg is so... I understand rage quitting as a general thing.

83
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,819
Rym: Yeah, if you're bad at it, it's gonna be over.

84
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,820
Scott: I can understand why someone would rage quit in a game, period.

85
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,300
Scott: Why would you rage quit in a game that is, like, 30 seconds long?

86
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:07,989
Scott: You wanna know why?

87
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:08,760
Rym: I'll tell you why.

88
00:04:08,821 --> 00:04:10,300
Scott: Does it have a record, like Mario Kart?

89
00:04:10,863 --> 00:04:10,903
Scott: No.

90
00:04:10,923 --> 00:04:11,710
Rym: There's no record.

91
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,000
Scott: You have no idea how good people are.

92
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,240
Scott: So you're not even hurting yourself in any way, versus losing.

93
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:16,562
Rym: Zero.

94
00:04:16,582 --> 00:04:18,240
Rym: So here's why people rage quit.

95
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:24,000
Rym: The way it works is, you're basically, whoever's player one picks the map, and when you both hit ready, you just fight.

96
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,015
Rym: The only information you get, unless you chat with each other, is the name.

97
00:04:29,075 --> 00:04:30,500
Rym: Like, the Steam name.

98
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:40,400
Rym: So, what'll happen is, someone will be playing against me, and I trounce them, and then, once you beat someone, you play the same person again, if you want, most of the time.

99
00:04:41,025 --> 00:04:42,899
Rym: So, they'll join the game again.

100
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,697
Scott: They see it's you.

101
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,280
Rym: They see me trouncing them, and they quit, hoping to get another player.

102
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,340
Rym: But there aren't other players, because I've already driven everyone else away.

103
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:56,480
Rym: So the ready room reappears, it's just me, and then the same name that just rage quit joins again.

104
00:04:57,221 --> 00:05:00,000
Rym: And then immediately rage quits once they recognize my name.

105
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,225
Scott: One time I played Dr.

106
00:05:01,265 --> 00:05:03,275
Scott: Mario on the Wii, and I was just like, "Online!

107
00:05:03,315 --> 00:05:04,018
Scott: Make me play against

108
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:04,360
Scott: someone!".

109
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,152
Scott: And much to my surprise, even though, this was like a few months ago, so the game is already mad old, someone was actually there playing.

110
00:05:10,172 --> 00:05:10,454
Scott: I was like,

111
00:05:10,474 --> 00:05:11,058
Scott: "Whoa!".

112
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:12,671
Rym: You made that kid's day.

113
00:05:12,691 --> 00:05:13,820
Rym: He's been waiting.

114
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,264
Scott: Yeah, we played some Dr.

115
00:05:15,304 --> 00:05:18,478
Scott: Mario, and they were really fucking good, but I'm also really good at Dr.

116
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:18,820
Scott: Mario.

117
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,640
Scott: But not, you know, super good, but better than everyone else I know.

118
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:27,440
Scott: And, you know, it was close, I lost, and then it was close, I won, and then it was close, I lost.

119
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,142
Scott: And it was like,

120
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:28,584
Scott: "Alright.".

121
00:05:28,685 --> 00:05:31,758
Scott: But then it's like, even though it was close, I'm like, "I'm done with

122
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:31,959
Scott: this.".

123
00:05:32,762 --> 00:05:34,190
Scott: There's only one person to play against.

124
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,793
Scott: The game ended.

125
00:05:34,853 --> 00:05:35,778
Scott: It's like, "Okay, play someone

126
00:05:35,838 --> 00:05:35,938
Scott: new.".

127
00:05:36,441 --> 00:05:39,077
Scott: The same person you just played is the only person playing Dr.

128
00:05:39,117 --> 00:05:39,660
Scott: Mario Wii.

129
00:05:40,681 --> 00:05:49,020
Rym: So, I love Nidhogg, but I want to very briefly go over, now that I've played it a lot, and I understand how it works really well, it has some problems.

130
00:05:49,681 --> 00:05:52,020
Rym: And it's kind of worrying that it has these problems.

131
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,860
Scott: Alright, so the person who's played it many more hours, do you see problems besides the problems that we, at, like, first glance, possible problems?

132
00:05:59,162 --> 00:06:00,388
Rym: Uh, basically, no.

133
00:06:00,429 --> 00:06:02,520
Rym: Well, there's two problems, fundamentally.

134
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:09,680
Rym: Problem number one, you need to be able to auto-kill yourself to start in front of the other player.

135
00:06:10,001 --> 00:06:11,065
Rym: That has to be a button.

136
00:06:11,566 --> 00:06:15,260
Rym: Because running off the other side of the screen is not intuitive.

137
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,160
Rym: Now, it's fine if that is also an option.

138
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,800
Scott: Not killing yourself is also not intuitive.

139
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:20,620
Scott: Well, not killing yourself.

140
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,818
Scott: It should be a respawn button, not a suicide button.

141
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:32,059
Rym: What the button should do is, when you hit the button, it should make you disappear, as though you had died, and it respawns you at whatever its respawn logic is.

142
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,498
Scott: Well, they should show you the respawn timer, too.

143
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,600
Scott: Or whatever, you know, like, they should show you the spot and the time.

144
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,200
Rym: Okay, so one thing, so if we're getting into all one, I'll just put, I'll frame it this way.

145
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,465
Rym: Here's what I would change.

146
00:06:44,067 --> 00:06:54,520
Rym: I would say that you can hit a button at any time to respawn, but as soon as you hit that button, it starts counting down the default respawn timer as though you had been killed.

147
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:59,917
Rym: And then, at that time, you always spawn in front of your opponent.

148
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:00,940
Rym: Immediately.

149
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:06,900
Rym: And if you hit the button to respawn again, then the respawn timer starts counting down again.

150
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:13,977
Rym: I would add a variant, where instead of a respawn timer, you have five respawns, let's say.

151
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:14,900
Rym: Just five.

152
00:07:15,221 --> 00:07:17,025
Rym: And they slowly regenerate.

153
00:07:17,286 --> 00:07:23,260
Rym: You can respawn immediately if you want, but if you use all five, you gotta wait for at least one to regenerate.

154
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,322
Scott: Right, because it's annoying.

155
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:31,560
Scott: There are situations where someone will, basically, the strategy of losing your sword, running and jumping over the opponent, right?

156
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,520
Scott: So the only way they can stop you is by hitting you with their sword.

157
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,760
Rym: Which is pretty trivial to do.

158
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,460
Scott: Right, which is, you can do it, but you basically have one chance, right?

159
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:49,340
Scott: So it's like, you can do it if you know what you're doing, but you can't consistently doing it 100% of the time is an extremely small margin of error.

160
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:56,020
Scott: And because they go so fast when they're just running without a sword at all, you lose a whole screen.

161
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:03,520
Scott: Even if you're like, "Shit, I missed it, I didn't kill them," run off the screen to die, you will not respawn in time before they make it to the next screen.

162
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,200
Scott: And you lose a whole screen in like a fraction of a second.

163
00:08:07,464 --> 00:08:09,120
Rym: Which is fine, I like severe consequences.

164
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:15,900
Scott: Right, but it basically means the best strategy in the world is force your opponent to be perfect, and unless you're 100% perfect, I win.

165
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,280
Scott: And the game's over in two seconds.

166
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:21,539
Rym: But, both players have the same capacity to do these things.

167
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,560
Scott: Right, but then that first kill makes fucking all the difference in the world.

168
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:30,600
Rym: Yeah, except against skilled players, when I do run into them, you can't just jump over them.

169
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:30,749
Rym: Sure.

170
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,879
Rym: And other people can't just jump over me.

171
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:37,860
Scott: I think the way to solve this would be to make the throwing sword travel much faster.

172
00:08:38,941 --> 00:08:47,340
Scott: Such that when you throw a sword, it doesn't have to go instant, like they can't even react to it, but it should go faster than a person who is running with no sword.

173
00:08:47,662 --> 00:08:47,838
Rym: It does!

174
00:08:48,982 --> 00:08:50,280
Scott: Nah, you sort of get away from it.

175
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,259
Rym: No, it goes faster.

176
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:52,899
Scott: It doesn't seem like it's me.

177
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,559
Rym: It definitely goes faster.

178
00:08:55,842 --> 00:08:57,999
Rym: But the thing is, it doesn't matter, because I'll roll under it.

179
00:09:04,981 --> 00:09:05,400
Rym: That's true.

180
00:09:05,741 --> 00:09:12,300
Rym: When and how to respawn in front of your opponent, and make it clear when and where you will respawn and when you'll respawn.

181
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,295
Rym: The time and everything all has to be open.

182
00:09:14,315 --> 00:09:14,940
Rym: It shouldn't be hidden.

183
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:30,640
Rym: I shouldn't have to do the bullshit I'm doing lately, where I'll back up or move forward to make sure that when I kill a person, or when I die, like if I don't have a sword and I know I'm going to die, I'll make sure that it happens in such a way that is advantageous to me on the respawn, because I know where that shit is.

184
00:09:31,144 --> 00:09:32,219
Rym: And I hate that in games.

185
00:09:33,381 --> 00:09:43,100
Rym: But I do want to leave the option to run off the back of the screen, because a lot of times what I'll do is I'll run back like I'm going to run away, then I'll turn around and whip a sword at their back, and then run off the screen.

186
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,079
Scott: If they're a whole screen away, how's that going to hit?

187
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:50,613
Rym: So, I throw the sword, it's coming at them faster than they can run, then I respawn.

188
00:09:50,654 --> 00:09:52,599
Rym: on the other side of them, there's a sword flying.

189
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,636
Scott: I've never been able to, by that time, they're already on the other screen.

190
00:09:55,716 --> 00:09:55,998
Scott: How is...

191
00:09:56,664 --> 00:09:58,160
Rym: I don't know, you're terrible at this game?

192
00:09:59,222 --> 00:10:04,040
Scott: If I run off the screen, 99% of the time the person makes the next screen before I can respawn.

193
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,260
Rym: Yeah, that's just because you're kind of bad.

194
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:08,399
Scott: I'm running off the screen as soon as I have to.

195
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,400
Rym: Some of the screens are wider than others, you've got to take all this into account.

196
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:30,740
Rym: But anyway, the other thing that bothers me, and it worries me that this game was the artisanal game that was in development for so long, yet it has these fundamental problems, the actual direct sword fighting, as in move forward, move back, move the things up and down, at least with the controllers we have available on PCs, are actually kind of fucking fiddly.

197
00:10:31,325 --> 00:10:32,140
Scott: It is a little bit fiddly.

198
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:45,880
Rym: And when I do find a very skilled player, you'll find that even to extremely skilled players, the odds of someone successfully disarming another person by anything other than random dumb fucking luck, pretty much zero.

199
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,100
Rym: You don't elegantly in, out, in, out, sword, down, up, kill.

200
00:10:51,802 --> 00:10:53,600
Scott: The up and down is pretty good.

201
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:54,359
Scott: No, it's not.

202
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,160
Scott: But the left and right of just taking a step forward and a step backwards is a little fiddly.

203
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,200
Scott: They need to make it easier to just be like step, step, step, lunge, right?

204
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,073
Rym: They need to tighten up the controls, that's it.

205
00:11:04,094 --> 00:11:05,000
Rym: It's like Super Meat Boy.

206
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,140
Rym: It needs Super Meat Boy level of control to be a real competitive game.

207
00:11:09,741 --> 00:11:16,380
Rym: As it is, it's a little fiddly, and I worry that they're not going to make it better.

208
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,336
Scott: Probably not.

209
00:11:18,183 --> 00:11:21,100
Rym: So, it's still fun, but I think it's going to be my air hockey.

210
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,399
Scott: I think it already is your air hockey.

211
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,959
Rym: So, speaking of air hockey, this man's air hockey is Jeopardy.

212
00:11:27,863 --> 00:11:28,287
Scott: Oh, yeah.

213
00:11:28,327 --> 00:11:28,589
Scott: All right.

214
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,679
Scott: So, what's the guy's name again?

215
00:11:30,164 --> 00:11:30,467
Rym: I don't know.

216
00:11:30,488 --> 00:11:31,359
Rym: I have the name of the other guy.

217
00:11:31,861 --> 00:11:32,953
Scott: Oh, I mean, Ken Jennings?

218
00:11:32,973 --> 00:11:33,519
Scott: Who's the new guy?

219
00:11:34,122 --> 00:11:34,744
Rym: No, no.

220
00:11:34,924 --> 00:11:35,707
Rym: Not Ken Jennings.

221
00:11:36,168 --> 00:11:39,740
Rym: I have the name of the guy we're going to talk about from that other game.

222
00:11:40,382 --> 00:11:41,030
Scott: Oh, okay.

223
00:11:41,172 --> 00:11:41,860
Scott: So specific.

224
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:42,266
Scott: Yeah?

225
00:11:42,741 --> 00:11:42,891
Rym: Yeah.

226
00:11:43,841 --> 00:11:44,660
Scott: Michael Larson.

227
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,460
Scott: Yeah, so the last time there was news about Jeopardy at all was Ken Jennings, who was just a really smart dude, right?

228
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,700
Scott: And he just won lots of Jeopardy.

229
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,306
Scott: But there's a new guy.

230
00:11:54,467 --> 00:11:59,175
Scott: His name is... Why don't you tell me the guy's name, Arthur Chu, right?

231
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:00,738
Rym: Arthur Chu.

232
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:01,338
Scott: Arthur Chu.

233
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:06,520
Scott: So he's basically, you know, Ken Jennings just sort of won with his incredible trivia knowledges, right?

234
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,840
Scott: He just got all their freaking answers.

235
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,950
Scott: What this guy does is he's really good at trivia.

236
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:15,020
Scott: I mean, you're not going to win Jeopardy if you get all the questions wrong, right?

237
00:12:15,642 --> 00:12:16,794
Scott: But, I mean, answers wrong.

238
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:17,360
Scott: Or questions.

239
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,330
Rym: Well, yeah, questions.

240
00:12:18,412 --> 00:12:18,960
Rym: You're correct.

241
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:28,180
Scott: But he's basically playing Jeopardy the game itself differently from anyone else ever has, and that is awesome.

242
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:36,200
Rym: Now, what's extra interesting about this is that in high school, I was in Quiz Bowl, which is kind of like a big boy version of Jeopardy.

243
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:44,180
Rym: And I say that because the questions are about the same caliber, but the difference is that the way it's designed, it's usually team on team, you can buzz in at any time.

244
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:55,140
Rym: Jeopardy, from what I have read, was designed to be that way, and test audiences found that it made them feel stupid because people buzzed in early all the time, and you didn't really get a chance to see the questions.

245
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,401
Rym: Right.

246
00:12:55,421 --> 00:12:58,571
Scott: A lot of the way Jeopardy works, remember, it's a TV show that makes money.

247
00:12:58,631 --> 00:12:59,494
Scott: It makes a lot of money.

248
00:12:59,514 --> 00:13:01,440
Scott: That's why it's been around for decades, right?

249
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,211
Scott: I mean, I would watch Jeopardy in the 80s, right?

250
00:13:04,552 --> 00:13:06,179
Scott: You know, Alex Trebek is mad old.

251
00:13:07,923 --> 00:13:08,580
Rym: Shuck it, Trebek.

252
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,480
Scott: So they don't let you buzz in until he finishes reading the question, and, you know, all these stuff to make it.

253
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,968
Rym: Yeah, there's an article that talks about the timing.

254
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:19,340
Rym: Like, when you're allowed to buzz in, and if you buzz in early, you're fucked.

255
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:34,020
Scott: So basically, it just so happens that the way, if you want to play Jeopardy to win, and you already have the trivia knowledge required, part of the strategies it takes to win, which are within the rules of the game as it stands, make it bad for TV.

256
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:48,020
Scott: So normally when you play Jeopardy, right, what most people do is they will start with the, pick a category they know, if they have control of the board, start at the easiest question, work their way down to rack up as much safe money as they can, right?

257
00:13:48,722 --> 00:13:55,380
Scott: And if they think a category is getting too hard, they'll switch to, like, their second best category, start at the easy and work their way down to the hard.

258
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:01,500
Scott: Because if you choose the hard category, you're going to lose, you're going to mess it up and someone else, you know, you lose control, whatever.

259
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:13,040
Scott: What this guy does is he basically, and that makes it good for television to start at the easy and work down to the hard because the viewer is following and sort of working up from easy to hard also, right?

260
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,020
Scott: And it's good for people watching TV for it to progress that way.

261
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:25,760
Scott: He just goes and gets all the hard ones near the bottom and the bottom two rows randomly all over the place not caring about the category because he's looking for the Daily Double.

262
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:33,380
Scott: He either is going to get the Daily Double because, A, he can make a fuck ton of money on that and get such a huge lead, right, because it's more valuable.

263
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,680
Rym: And he'll have a bunch of money to bet already because he's gotten a bunch of the other hard questions.

264
00:14:38,761 --> 00:14:43,972
Scott: Or, he'll simply bet zero on the Daily Double and be like, "Denied!

265
00:14:44,032 --> 00:14:47,078
Scott: No one else can get the Daily Double and take a big jump and get away from

266
00:14:47,118 --> 00:14:47,238
Scott: me.".

267
00:14:48,582 --> 00:14:52,075
Scott: And he knows the Daily Double is down there in the bottom somewhere, so he's just looking for it.

268
00:14:52,115 --> 00:14:53,260
Scott: He's hunting for it real hard.

269
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,147
Scott: And this pissed off a lot of Jeopardy!

270
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,832
Scott: viewers because they don't like that, right?

271
00:14:58,852 --> 00:15:00,297
Scott: Some guy actually playing to win?

272
00:15:00,497 --> 00:15:01,400
Scott: Scoff, right?

273
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,608
Rym: Yeah, fans are calling him a villain.

274
00:15:07,821 --> 00:15:09,244
Scott: Yeah, he's a hero in my eyes.

275
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:13,652
Scott: Anyway, the second thing he's doing is, remember, the way Jeopardy!

276
00:15:13,692 --> 00:15:17,580
Scott: works is if you win, you have the most money after the final, right?

277
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,144
Scott: Then you get to play Jeopardy!

278
00:15:20,184 --> 00:15:21,026
Scott: again the next day.

279
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:22,810
Scott: And as long as you can keep playing Jeopardy!

280
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:27,440
Scott: the next day, you can keep getting basically free money in exchange for answering trivia questions.

281
00:15:27,941 --> 00:15:29,686
Scott: So, all your goal in Jeopardy!

282
00:15:29,806 --> 00:15:31,230
Scott: is get to the next day.

283
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,193
Scott: How do you get to the next day?

284
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,800
Scott: Have more money than everyone else at the end of the day.

285
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:35,318
Scott: Or tie.

286
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,762
Scott: Or tie.

287
00:15:36,963 --> 00:15:38,447
Scott: So, mostly, in the final

288
00:15:38,487 --> 00:15:38,948
Scott: Jeopardy!,

289
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,656
Scott: when you bid, how much you're betting that?

290
00:15:41,696 --> 00:15:43,120
Scott: you know that question, right?

291
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:55,159
Scott: Most people will look and be like, "Okay, I got a hundred, Rym's got fifty, he's gotta bet everything, you know, to tie me, so I'm gonna bet one, so when I get it right, I'm gonna

292
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:55,380
Scott: win.".

293
00:15:56,241 --> 00:16:00,960
Scott: But if I bet one and I lose, and Rym gets it right, then I lose and I don't make it to tomorrow.

294
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,014
Rym: But if I bet zero...

295
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,766
Scott: I should bet zero, that way, no matter what, I'll make it to tomorrow.

296
00:16:05,786 --> 00:16:12,960
Scott: So you take that math and apply it to the actual numbers they're using, and basically, this guy always bids to tie.

297
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,415
Scott: He doesn't care if you also get to play tomorrow.

298
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:16,120
Scott: What does he give a shit?

299
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,360
Rym: In fact, he's already beaten you, so he'd rather have you than a stranger.

300
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:26,560
Scott: As long as he gets to go to tomorrow, he doesn't care about tying, and that makes it boring for viewers, because you get all these ties, they want to see a win.

301
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,192
Rym: But think about that, he's bringing someone he already beat with him to the next day.

302
00:16:30,232 --> 00:16:32,540
Rym: That's like if I pick a loser from the losing team.

303
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,167
Scott: Worst case scenario, he ties, right?

304
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:39,460
Scott: If everyone else gets it wrong and he gets it right, you know, in the best case scenario, he just wins.

305
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,617
Rym: But if I play the Mets, can I pick one of their bad players and be like, "Yeah, I get to play against you again

306
00:16:43,677 --> 00:16:44,260
Rym: tomorrow.".

307
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:44,801
Scott: Right.

308
00:16:46,323 --> 00:16:51,869
Scott: So, yeah, I mean, if I was in jeopardy, I'd be like, "Look, don't worry about winning or losing.

309
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:59,879
Scott: Let's all conspire together to always tie, so all three of us and no one else will ever get to drink from this free money pool for the rest of our

310
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:00,200
Scott: lives.".

311
00:17:02,501 --> 00:17:07,700
Rym: Now, this guy is not doing anything special, but look, the game was already designed in a lot of ways.

312
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,679
Scott: Why did it take decades for anyone to do this?

313
00:17:10,261 --> 00:17:10,883
Rym: Why indeed?

314
00:17:10,943 --> 00:17:12,968
Rym: Well, this has happened in the past, guys.

315
00:17:13,228 --> 00:17:18,160
Rym: So, way back in the 80s, there was a game show that I used to watch semi-religiously.

316
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,118
Scott: That's happened in jeopardy, though.

317
00:17:19,401 --> 00:17:19,584
Rym: No.

318
00:17:19,848 --> 00:17:20,659
Rym: Called Press Your Luck.

319
00:17:21,002 --> 00:17:21,498
Scott: Oh, good show.

320
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,412
Scott: And there was a gentleman- People have to know about this.

321
00:17:24,432 --> 00:17:25,019
Scott: Everyone knows about this.

322
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,582
Rym: I hope so, but just in case, I'll link to it.

323
00:17:26,602 --> 00:17:31,029
Rym: There's a gentleman named Michael Arson who watched it on TV and realized, "Oh, there's a pattern.

324
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:37,739
Rym: All I have to do is get on the show and I can rack up an infinite never-ending game of infinite

325
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:38,000
Rym: money.".

326
00:17:38,403 --> 00:17:39,318
Rym: And he actually did it.

327
00:17:39,524 --> 00:17:39,731
Scott: Yep.

328
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:49,540
Rym: So, the fact that it didn't happen in jeopardy, I think, is solely because the kinds of people who were interested in Jeopardy were the kinds of people who were interested in Quizzy-type stuff.

329
00:17:49,742 --> 00:17:50,140
Scott: Exactly.

330
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,280
Rym: And they're not interested in games as a whole.

331
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:59,300
Scott: People who go to get on Jeopardy are almost always 100% focused on the buzzer and the trivia, right?

332
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,723
Rym: The same way with The Price is Right.

333
00:18:12,141 --> 00:18:15,600
Rym: Oh, Scott and I will be playing some Jeopardy on Super Nintendo in the near future.

334
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,787
Scott: But all I've done is tried to get the trivia.

335
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:21,319
Scott: I've never actually thought about, "Hey, is there a strategy to picking

336
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:21,480
Scott: these?".

337
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,319
Scott: It's like, "No, they're all going to get picked at some

338
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:23,440
Scott: point.".

339
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:23,906
Scott: See, no, no.

340
00:18:23,966 --> 00:18:25,019
Rym: I thought about that a lot.

341
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,380
Scott: And whoever knows the most and buzzes in, you'll win if you just get them right.

342
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,479
Rym: When I was a kid, I had the Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy home games.

343
00:18:33,624 --> 00:18:35,020
Scott: The ones with the physical ones?

344
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,213
Scott: Yeah.

345
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:35,865
Scott: The board games?

346
00:18:35,905 --> 00:18:36,935
Scott: My cousin had those.

347
00:18:37,036 --> 00:18:37,440
Scott: Those are good.

348
00:18:37,763 --> 00:18:39,740
Rym: The Wheel of Fortune one was crazy good.

349
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,360
Scott: Yeah, I wish you could get some of those and play them for reals.

350
00:18:42,684 --> 00:18:43,197
Rym: I've got it.

351
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:44,499
Scott: We don't have it here.

352
00:18:44,741 --> 00:18:46,380
Rym: I could get my mom to mail it here.

353
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,320
Scott: Maybe we could buy a more modern one at Toys R Us.

354
00:18:48,381 --> 00:18:49,294
Rym: No, I want the one from the '80s.

355
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,217
Scott: Well, then let's go out on eBay and get maybe a '70s one or something, or a '90s one.

356
00:18:53,277 --> 00:18:53,719
Scott: I don't know.

357
00:18:54,500 --> 00:19:00,678
Rym: Anyway, so we would play these, and I didn't do everything he did because I wasn't that smart.

358
00:19:00,698 --> 00:19:01,200
Rym: I was a little kid.

359
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,720
Rym: But I always wondered, watching TV, why anyone went for the easy questions first.

360
00:19:06,342 --> 00:19:06,840
Rym: It's like in Jeopardy.

361
00:19:07,222 --> 00:19:09,859
Scott: Because if you control it, you're getting free monies.

362
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,758
Rym: Yeah, but if you go for the hard questions first...

363
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:18,100
Scott: Because you're picking the category that's more advantageous to you, and you're picking easy questions that you know you're going to get and the other people aren't going to get.

364
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,409
Rym: But at the same time, what if you hesitate slightly and the other person buzzes in?

365
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:24,735
Rym: You might as well decide the game earlier.

366
00:19:24,995 --> 00:19:26,820
Rym: Have more money available earlier.

367
00:19:27,823 --> 00:19:29,840
Rym: And if you can't answer the hard questions, you're fucked.

368
00:19:30,145 --> 00:19:30,480
Scott: Of course.

369
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,520
Rym: You were fucked anyway if you couldn't answer the hard questions.

370
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,320
Scott: That's right.

371
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:38,040
Rym: It's the same strategy as if you play Jenga with someone, go for that fucking bottom immediately.

372
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,880
Rym: Destabilize it as much as possible, as early as possible.

373
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:45,700
Rym: There's no reason to make the game go on longer if you're confident in your skills to not knock it over.

374
00:19:47,241 --> 00:19:48,539
Rym: That's the strategy there.

375
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,760
Rym: So I always wondered why people on Jeopardy were kind of derpy about it.

376
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,376
Rym: But in Quiz Bowl...

377
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,505
Scott: They're derpy.

378
00:19:53,546 --> 00:19:54,491
Scott: We've proven that.

379
00:19:54,632 --> 00:19:55,637
Scott: This guy's not derpy.

380
00:19:55,677 --> 00:19:56,200
Scott: He's my hero.

381
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,694
Rym: If you find some video of high school Quiz Bowl, they put all that strategy together.

382
00:20:00,714 --> 00:20:02,820
Rym: They'll have metrics on word counts.

383
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,429
Rym: Like how many words, like you're on a team, right?

384
00:20:05,489 --> 00:20:08,280
Rym: So if anyone on the team buzzes in, your whole team's chance is shot.

385
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:17,000
Rym: So we had a rule of one person was the only person for a given type of question who was allowed to buzz in within the first five words.

386
00:20:17,402 --> 00:20:19,197
Rym: Because he was the one who was most likely to get it.

387
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:21,359
Rym: So we'd have strategies around that.

388
00:20:21,701 --> 00:20:26,440
Rym: We'd hear things like a Midsummer night and someone just buzzes in and says William Shakespeare something something.

389
00:20:27,221 --> 00:20:28,859
Rym: And sometimes it would work.

390
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,039
Rym: For certain kinds of questions, one guy would always...

391
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:32,463
Scott: How do you know?

392
00:20:32,483 --> 00:20:33,996
Scott: the answer wasn't like the name of a character?

393
00:20:34,036 --> 00:20:34,399
Scott: Like Puck?

394
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:41,740
Rym: Yeah, so we'd, based on the odds, we'd also study the questions from previous tournaments because a lot of times they'd recycle them.

395
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,560
Rym: So yeah, one guy I knew would always hold the buzzer like under his chin.

396
00:20:48,441 --> 00:20:54,780
Rym: Like he'd hold it up and he'd put his chin on the buzzer and he'd like mash down with his chin to buzz in because he swore he could buzz in faster that way.

397
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,500
Scott: No, probably not.

398
00:20:56,701 --> 00:20:57,029
Rym: I don't know.

399
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,380
Scott: Anyway, I just want to read a quote from the guy, right, that makes, to show you why he's our hero.

400
00:21:04,381 --> 00:21:09,898
Scott: "All of the things I'm doing are very obvious logical ways to maximize your chances of winning that are well within the

401
00:21:09,938 --> 00:21:10,259
Scott: rules.".

402
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:19,179
Scott: He said, "It's hard for me to take seriously the argument that I should give up that kind of money just for the sake of making the viewing audience feel

403
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:19,640
Scott: comfortable.".

404
00:21:20,401 --> 00:21:20,899
Scott: Fuck yes.

405
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,946
Rym: Yup, if Jeopardy!

406
00:21:21,986 --> 00:21:23,840
Rym: cared about the audience, they'd change the rules.

407
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:33,880
Scott: If I'm playing a board game and someone's upset that I'm like dicking the mother, I'm saying, I'm gonna say, "All of the things I'm doing are very obvious logical ways to maximize my chances of winning that are well within the rules.

408
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:39,518
Scott: It's hard for me to take seriously the argument that I should give up that kind of money just for the sake of making the other players feel

409
00:21:39,578 --> 00:21:39,980
Scott: comfortable.".

410
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:47,140
Rym: Also, I point out that if the game is so broken that an obvious strategy is way overpowered, then the game's broken.

411
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,684
Scott: Well, I mean, Jeopardy!

412
00:21:48,745 --> 00:21:51,120
Scott: isn't broken because it doesn't really matter what the rules are.

413
00:21:51,783 --> 00:21:53,220
Scott: You have to know the trivia, right?

414
00:21:53,301 --> 00:21:54,479
Scott: If you know the trivia, you can win it.

415
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:59,240
Scott: Even though I know the strategies this guy has, I can't win in Jeopardy!

416
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,514
Scott: I'll just be like, "What the fuck?

417
00:22:00,574 --> 00:22:00,817
Scott: I don't

418
00:22:00,858 --> 00:22:00,959
Scott: know.".

419
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:08,040
Scott: They'll be like, "You know, this scholar from the 15th century wrote this obscure

420
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:08,140
Scott: work.".

421
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,251
Scott: And I'll be like, "Doo, doo, doo.

422
00:22:10,473 --> 00:22:10,957
Scott: No fucking

423
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:11,199
Scott: clue.".

424
00:22:11,966 --> 00:22:13,017
Scott: Who is no fucking clue?

425
00:22:13,037 --> 00:22:13,320
Scott: Sorry.

426
00:22:13,561 --> 00:22:14,940
Rym: So I know a bunch of people who tried out Jeopardy!

427
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,780
Scott: Yes, it was no fucking clue.

428
00:22:17,601 --> 00:22:22,000
Rym: You do get an indication of what the topics are going to be and what the questions are going to be.

429
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,339
Rym: You get some stuff ahead of time.

430
00:22:23,901 --> 00:22:29,177
Rym: It's not just random, random, anything from any possible realm of knowledge.

431
00:22:29,217 --> 00:22:30,200
Rym: There's a little bit of guidance.

432
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:33,019
Scott: It's usually realms of knowledge I do not have.

433
00:22:33,743 --> 00:22:36,139
Rym: Well, you can't name 14th century composers.

434
00:22:37,001 --> 00:22:40,903
Scott: I can name some of them, but I can't tell who's 14.

435
00:22:40,903 --> 00:22:43,920
Scott: I know some which century they are, but some I don't.

436
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,379
Rym: You can't name famous poets.

437
00:22:46,222 --> 00:22:47,180
Scott: I can name a couple.

438
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,097
Rym: Yeats and Keats.

439
00:22:48,724 --> 00:22:49,420
Scott: Robert Frost.

440
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:49,840
Rym: No.

441
00:22:50,542 --> 00:22:51,239
Scott: Okay, there's one.

442
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:52,480
Scott: Sure.

443
00:22:53,367 --> 00:22:53,700
Scott: Obvious.

444
00:22:55,463 --> 00:22:56,020
Rym: Shel Silverstein.

445
00:22:57,326 --> 00:22:58,039
Rym: Yes, that's one.

446
00:22:59,561 --> 00:23:02,620
Rym: So the next time you're watching The Price is Right, ask yourself this.

447
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:13,320
Rym: Is there any reason in this fucking earth to not bid either $1 more than another person or $1 if you bid last in The Price is Right?

448
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:13,937
Rym: And the answer is no.

449
00:23:14,302 --> 00:23:14,979
Scott: If you bid last, no.

450
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,000
Rym: Yes, and if you bid second to last, you might still want to do one of those options.

451
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,237
Scott: Of course, but the problem with being second to last is someone who's bid $1 more than you.

452
00:23:24,121 --> 00:23:28,520
Rym: Yep, so then you have to play that, but I've noticed that people don't really take that into account.

453
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,800
Scott: You know what I want to do in Price is Right?

454
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:41,320
Scott: If I'm not bidding last, I want to help the person who is going before me so that they get... Help the correct person get up on stage so that I then bid last next time.

455
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:41,998
Rym: Exactly.

456
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,280
Scott: Unless it's the final battle.

457
00:23:43,741 --> 00:23:45,899
Rym: Guys, play to win games or don't play them.

458
00:23:47,466 --> 00:23:49,580
Scott: Or play games where there's no winning, like apples to apples.

459
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,811
Rym: Are you a player of games?

460
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:55,980
Rym: Are you simply the king of a shitty civilization that's going to collapse?

461
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:04,850
Rym: So anyway, things of the day.

462
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:05,968
Rym: You got a thing of the day?

463
00:24:06,532 --> 00:24:07,509
Scott: I do have a thing of the day.

464
00:24:07,951 --> 00:24:10,750
Scott: I think it's in Germany or somewhere where they speak German.

465
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,270
Scott: It sounds like German anyway.

466
00:24:13,732 --> 00:24:16,410
Scott: But yeah, this guy, he's walking down the street.

467
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:24,469
Scott: He gets to a crosswalk, a pretty big crosswalk, and he notices the button for changing the light and letting the blind people know when the light is changing and whatnot.

468
00:24:24,892 --> 00:24:27,230
Scott: Has this touchscreen attached to it.

469
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:29,950
Scott: And the touchscreen has a pretty cool user interface.

470
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:34,370
Scott: When it's safe to go, it fills up with green completely.

471
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:42,730
Scott: But the green basically empties out, and from the top down, the screen turns gray slowly until there's a sliver of green that then disappears.

472
00:24:43,472 --> 00:24:47,250
Scott: And that lets you know how long there is left before the light changes back to red.

473
00:24:47,811 --> 00:24:48,469
Scott: And vice versa.

474
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:56,589
Scott: When it is red, it drains out from the bottom, as if someone opened up the drain in the sink, until it is all gray again.

475
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:01,470
Scott: And that lets you know how long you're going to have to wait until walking is a possibility.

476
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:13,030
Scott: Because the red light is so long, and it's this touchscreen computer doing this, which is really helpful to begin with, it lets you do something pretty cool during the red light to pass the time.

477
00:25:13,251 --> 00:25:14,030
Rym: Oh, by the way, it's fake.

478
00:25:14,533 --> 00:25:14,909
Scott: Is it fake?

479
00:25:15,293 --> 00:25:16,670
Rym: Yeah, I'm looking at the video again.

480
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:21,290
Rym: One, you can see the fucking, like, masking Alias artifacts around his finger.

481
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,390
Rym: And if you watch it, you can actually-- Are you sure it's fake?

482
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,510
Rym: Yes, I'm sure it's fake.

483
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:29,510
Rym: You can actually see the animation tracking incorrectly a little bit.

484
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,901
Scott: Alright, it's possibly fake.

485
00:25:32,043 --> 00:25:32,870
Scott: Fake or not, good idea.

486
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:35,630
Rym: Also, in the text of the description, it says it's fake.

487
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:36,830
Rym: You just obviously didn't--.

488
00:25:36,891 --> 00:25:38,550
Scott: No, this could be real, no.

489
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:39,290
Rym: Uh, Scott?

490
00:25:40,513 --> 00:25:42,050
Scott: I do not read descriptions on videos.

491
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:43,629
Rym: Well, because it's all in German, for one.

492
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,250
Scott: Then how do you know it says fake?

493
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,908
Scott: Because I translated it.

494
00:25:48,793 --> 00:25:52,569
Scott: Oh, well, this is a fake video of a thing that should be real.

495
00:25:53,711 --> 00:25:58,850
Scott: Where you can play Pong against a person on the other side of the street while they're waiting for the crosswalk as well.

496
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:04,790
Scott: We should make this with Arduinos and stick it to two light posts in New York.

497
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:05,286
Rym: Yeah, we should.

498
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,990
Scott: And use wireless for them to communicate.

499
00:26:08,012 --> 00:26:09,530
Rym: Here's the brilliance of this idea.

500
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,470
Rym: I don't think you guys really understand why this is brilliant.

501
00:26:11,731 --> 00:26:13,149
Rym: So you're playing against a human being.

502
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:14,930
Scott: Who's on the other side of the street, who's a stranger.

503
00:26:15,871 --> 00:26:22,010
Rym: Anyone who's waiting at the light that you're waiting at, you're going to pass them when the light turns green.

504
00:26:22,311 --> 00:26:25,750
Rym: So you're guaranteed to meet the human being you just played with to high-five.

505
00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:31,208
Rym: This would be the best way to pick up ladies or gentlemen or whatever your taste might be.

506
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:37,490
Rym: Because anyone who's cool enough to play this, lose to me and still be cool about it after I cross is probably a cool person.

507
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:40,684
Rym: Notice the implied "they're gonna lose to

508
00:26:40,744 --> 00:26:40,825
Rym: me.".

509
00:26:43,071 --> 00:26:56,150
Rym: So you guys know that aside from GeekNights and as yet unannounced things and all these different things I do in my life, one of my jobs is being a product manager for a Wall Street enterprise software and services company.

510
00:26:56,971 --> 00:26:58,840
Rym: So I give a lot of pitches.

511
00:26:59,281 --> 00:27:01,170
Rym: I sit through a lot of pitches of other people.

512
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:06,270
Rym: I interact with enterprise-y software in a very sort of high-level way.

513
00:27:07,091 --> 00:27:16,525
Rym: And I would like to say that this video, my thing of the day, which is simply called "The Pitch Web Design," is almost exactly how these things go, 99% of the time.

514
00:27:19,937 --> 00:27:22,710
Rym: Replace the web aspect with another type of industry.

515
00:27:23,152 --> 00:27:25,030
Rym: It's pretty much just drag and drops everywhere.

516
00:27:26,492 --> 00:27:28,506
Rym: I also like how the guy says "homepage" instead of

517
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:28,929
Rym: "homepage."

518
00:27:29,334 --> 00:27:30,268
Rym: I'm going to start saying it that way.

519
00:27:32,794 --> 00:27:34,368
Rym: In a moment, the Book Club book was?

520
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,510
Scott: "Idadoo" by William Gibson.

521
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:38,449
Scott: We're done with it.

522
00:27:38,611 --> 00:27:40,310
Scott: Cyberpunk classic of all time.

523
00:27:40,532 --> 00:27:41,810
Rym: It is definitely a classic.

524
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:46,089
Rym: And having read it again, because I hadn't read it in a long time, I like it a lot.

525
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:46,929
Scott: It's really good.

526
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:51,670
Rym: Despite its flaws, I like it a lot because a lot of the things in it are happening now.

527
00:27:51,911 --> 00:27:54,810
Rym: But at the same time, a lot of the things in it are nowhere near happening.

528
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:58,290
Scott: And a lot of the things happened and we're done with pass machines.

529
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:02,710
Rym: Some of it's so dated, like the geopolitical situation, like the Russians.

530
00:28:03,992 --> 00:28:05,650
Scott: On Thursday, we will talk about that.

531
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:06,348
Rym: We will talk about that.

532
00:28:06,591 --> 00:28:10,170
Rym: The next Book Club book is "Wool" because everyone's fucking trying to get me to read that book.

533
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,390
Scott: Like sheep and you go "bzzzz" and the wool comes off.

534
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:15,430
Rym: Yes, but it's post-apocalyptic and also in the similar genre.

535
00:28:15,911 --> 00:28:16,889
Rym: So we're on a roll with this stuff.

536
00:28:17,771 --> 00:28:21,530
Rym: Of course, the Geek Knight's book as opposed to Book Club is just the Prince of Nothing books.

537
00:28:22,151 --> 00:28:22,750
Scott: Let's imagine that again.

538
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:23,730
Rym: You should really read those first.

539
00:28:24,231 --> 00:28:26,925
Rym: And the Rym book series is the E.N.M.

540
00:28:26,965 --> 00:28:27,830
Rym: Banks culture series.

541
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:31,770
Rym: Because after we did Player of Games, I read almost every goddamn culture book.

542
00:28:32,111 --> 00:28:34,770
Rym: And every one of them is great without exception.

543
00:28:37,312 --> 00:28:39,610
Scott: Let's see, you should visit us on the internet.

544
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,160
Scott: We both have YouTube channels.

545
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,510
Scott: Mine has a lot of Netrunner videos.

546
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:43,830
Scott: Rym has Utenna videos.

547
00:28:44,512 --> 00:28:46,450
Scott: You should visit my Twitch channel.

548
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:50,030
Rym: You should visit our forum, which is rocking lately in a big way.

549
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:54,830
Scott: You should follow us on Twitter where you can make fun of listeners who hate the new Twitter interface.

550
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:57,570
Rym: Oh my god, that guy is so mad about the new Twitter.

551
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:03,170
Scott: It's like, I've never seen someone so mad about something so trivial that they were unable to change.

552
00:29:03,692 --> 00:29:05,921
Scott: I wanted to pity him, but I couldn't.

553
00:29:05,982 --> 00:29:07,990
Scott: I just laughed at his patheticness.

554
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,195
Rym: What if Kill La Kill's Goku?

555
00:29:09,256 --> 00:29:12,250
Rym: uniform stars are shaped that way because everything is actually Southern Cross?

556
00:29:14,531 --> 00:29:16,961
Scott: Can the show really get any better?

557
00:29:16,981 --> 00:29:18,870
Scott: That is one way it could get better.

558
00:29:20,951 --> 00:29:23,845
Scott: There is nothing you could say that is going to make it any worse.

559
00:29:23,965 --> 00:29:24,870
Scott: It's only going to get better.

560
00:29:26,651 --> 00:29:27,719
Scott: And that's not because it's bad.

561
00:29:27,739 --> 00:29:29,250
Scott: It's because it's just invulnerable.

562
00:29:29,632 --> 00:29:31,821
Rym: Oh my god, that guy was so mad.

563
00:29:32,102 --> 00:29:33,850
Rym: Whatever, you'll accept any shit thrown at you.

564
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,610
Rym: Mine is not the place to save those who won't save themselves.

565
00:29:37,453 --> 00:29:40,010
Scott: Save me from this Twitter redesign.

566
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:44,690
Rym: This slight redesign of a few pixels, non-functional, at the top of a webpage.

567
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:48,850
Rym: You shoving bullshit down people's throats certainly doesn't make life any better.

568
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,357
Rym: I call bullshit when I see it.

569
00:29:50,397 --> 00:29:51,061
Rym: That's who I am.

570
00:29:51,102 --> 00:29:52,349
Rym: That's who I will always be.

571
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:58,990
Scott: Always be the guy who gets incredibly indignant and mad over trivial matters that are beyond your control.

572
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:02,282
Rym: I like when he sent us this quote, "Those who accept their fate find happiness.

573
00:30:02,322 --> 00:30:03,266
Rym: Those who defy it

574
00:30:03,326 --> 00:30:03,788
Rym: glory.".

575
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:08,807
Scott: The glory enraging futilely against the Twitter redesign.

576
00:30:08,888 --> 00:30:09,510
Scott: So glorious.

577
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,138
Scott: Seriously, it's not even a redesign.

578
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,847
Scott: They inverted the color scheme.

579
00:30:12,888 --> 00:30:13,310
Scott: That's it.

580
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,562
Scott: Wow, much hero.

581
00:30:14,703 --> 00:30:15,230
Scott: So glory.

582
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,069
Rym: Such, such wow.

583
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:17,394
Rym: Wow.

584
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:24,530
Rym: Yeah, you'll also see me pretty much constantly making fun of Patrick Rothfuss and the King Killer Chronicle lately.

585
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,388
Scott: Yeah, aren't you glad that was a book?

586
00:30:27,251 --> 00:30:29,490
Scott: Without it, you would have no material right now.

587
00:30:29,851 --> 00:30:32,123
Rym: You see, someone recommends a book to me and I read it.

588
00:30:32,324 --> 00:30:33,570
Rym: There's three possible outcomes.

589
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,509
Rym: The worst outcome is that it's mediocre.

590
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:39,190
Rym: If it's really good, I got a great new book to read.

591
00:30:39,691 --> 00:30:44,670
Rym: If it's really bad, I get to exult in explaining exactly why it's bad.

592
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:45,493
Scott: It's a virtual boy situation.

593
00:30:45,533 --> 00:30:47,822
Scott: It's like, "Yeah, I'll buy that brand new Nintendo console.

594
00:30:47,862 --> 00:30:49,208
Scott: Worst case, it's a virtual

595
00:30:49,268 --> 00:30:49,569
Scott: boy.".

596
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:52,170
Scott: Owning a virtual boy is pretty awesome even though it sucks.

597
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:58,450
Scott: Yeah, having read, you know, The Name of the Wind or at least partially having read it and knowing its true nature.

598
00:30:58,871 --> 00:31:03,210
Scott: Yeah, it's not a good book, but having read it is like owning a virtual boy.

599
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:07,549
Scott: Now, you can make fun of it and understand when other people make fun of it.

600
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:17,470
Rym: I also realized today that it's basically about a nice guy not having sex with women until he seduces the goddess of sex and becomes a sex god for everyone except the girl he actually likes and it's so male.

601
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:20,068
Rym: Anyway, for all its problems...

602
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:24,090
Scott: I want to go back, listen to the actual book club episode we did on it.

603
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:33,250
Scott: I think, you know, we said bad things about it, but I think it's basically, even though it's not like we've reread it, but our opinion of it has just gotten worse over time.

604
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:37,410
Rym: Well, what didn't help is that it was bad, but not, like it was still enjoyable.

605
00:31:37,872 --> 00:31:39,590
Rym: But then I read the second book.

606
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:40,776
Scott: I didn't read the second book.

607
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:43,530
Scott: I only heard you talking about reading the second book.

608
00:31:43,832 --> 00:31:44,824
Scott: I own the second book.

609
00:31:44,864 --> 00:31:45,350
Scott: It's unread.

610
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:46,107
Scott: Don't read it.

611
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:47,130
Rym: I'm not reading it.

612
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,910
Scott: Unless you really want to find... I think I'm just going to sell it on Amazon or something.

613
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:54,990
Rym: He has sex with so many people, but not the one girl he likes because he's a nice guy.

614
00:31:55,593 --> 00:31:55,830
Rym: Nice guy.

615
00:31:56,630 --> 00:32:00,370
Rym: So, I realize that the magic in this world is called sympathy.

616
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:04,509
Rym: He uses sympathy to get girls to have sex with him.

617
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,950
Rym: This book, and there's no way that was on purpose.

618
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,190
Rym: That's just, oh my god, these books.

619
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:11,923
Scott: Anyway...

620
00:32:12,192 --> 00:32:13,370
Rym: So that's been my Twitter lately.

621
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,070
Rym: Yeah, follow our stuff on the internet.

622
00:32:15,511 --> 00:32:16,868
Rym: And yeah, Otena, there's a new episode of it.

623
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:18,308
Scott: Our Otena.

624
00:32:18,431 --> 00:32:20,390
Scott: This new episode of GeekNights presents Otena.

625
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:22,470
Scott: There isn't a new episode of Otena and there never will be.

626
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,169
Rym: If there's ever a new episode of Otena...

627
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,869
Scott: What the fuck would happen in that episode?

628
00:32:26,912 --> 00:32:30,090
Rym: They could just do a Sailor Moon style Evangelion remake.

629
00:32:30,831 --> 00:32:32,189
Scott: Oh, return to Otari?

630
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:33,518
Rym: Yes, you are not a prince.

631
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:40,190
Scott: Revolutionary girl... Matthew?

632
00:32:42,373 --> 00:32:43,770
Rym: Anyway, so stakes.

633
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:44,954
Scott: Stakes?

634
00:32:44,974 --> 00:32:46,490
Scott: We're not talking about the vampire kind.

635
00:32:47,274 --> 00:32:48,469
Rym: Even though it's spelled the same way.

636
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:55,150
Scott: We're talking about consequences and rewards attached to winning and losing games.

637
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,549
Rym: I'm taking it back to a simpler time.

638
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:57,655
Rym: Time was 1987 or '88.

639
00:33:00,191 --> 00:33:01,390
Scott: When you were like six years old.

640
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:03,329
Rym: I was a young kid hanging out with other young kids.

641
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:06,310
Rym: And we'd play games like Paper, Rock, Scissors.

642
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:07,090
Rym: That's a good game.

643
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,768
Rym: Or Run to That Tree.

644
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,630
Scott: Whoever touches a tree first wins.

645
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:10,992
Rym: Yep.

646
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,189
Rym: Or loses.

647
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:15,310
Rym: And then you're trying to drag someone else over to the tree and shove them into it.

648
00:33:15,795 --> 00:33:16,829
Rym: That was actually way more fun.

649
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:22,470
Rym: So, a common thing we would do is add some stakes to any game like that.

650
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:27,670
Rym: Whoever loses has to get the slick slap, is what they called it.

651
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,746
Scott: You lick your fingers and on the wrist, pow.

652
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,489
Rym: There's a technique to it.

653
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:36,289
Rym: I've realized that young people, some kids get it and some kids don't.

654
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:37,450
Scott: And that was another thing.

655
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:41,810
Scott: If you won and you got the reward of being able to slap the person you have defeated.

656
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:42,654
Scott: And you were good at it?

657
00:33:45,331 --> 00:33:47,289
Scott: But you're really bad at slapping the arm.

658
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,368
Scott: Everyone's like, "Yeah, I let you win because what are you going to

659
00:33:50,408 --> 00:33:50,509
Scott: do?".

660
00:33:50,874 --> 00:33:51,302
Scott: "Oh, it didn't

661
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:51,546
Scott: hurt.".

662
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:55,164
Scott: And then if they win once, then when they do it to you, it's like,

663
00:33:55,345 --> 00:33:55,405
Scott: "Ah!".

664
00:33:59,133 --> 00:34:02,170
Rym: Well, you got to lick just the top bit of your fingers.

665
00:34:02,551 --> 00:34:06,350
Rym: And then you got to slap it just so perfectly right on the inside of the arm.

666
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,228
Scott: You basically got to pretend your whole arm is a whip.

667
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:13,250
Rym: You got to move your foot like you're a pitcher in a Major League Baseball game.

668
00:34:14,532 --> 00:34:16,529
Rym: So, did that add anything to our gaming?

669
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:21,010
Scott: Well, I was thinking about this recently because I was watching some Korean television.

670
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:23,748
Scott: In Korean television, they like to play all sorts of games.

671
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:33,306
Scott: Various kinds of childhood or just casual games like, "Throw the paper at the paper to make it flip

672
00:34:33,487 --> 00:34:33,688
Scott: over."

673
00:34:33,931 --> 00:34:34,484
Scott: Or, "Roll the

674
00:34:34,585 --> 00:34:34,750
Scott: coin."

675
00:34:35,351 --> 00:34:38,128
Scott: Or, "Flick the ghost stone to knock the other ghost stone off the

676
00:34:38,168 --> 00:34:38,350
Scott: board.".

677
00:34:38,431 --> 00:34:39,230
Scott: That sort of thing, right?

678
00:34:39,351 --> 00:34:39,417
Scott: Yup.

679
00:34:39,891 --> 00:34:45,710
Scott: And a common thing they will do is add punishments for the loser or rewards for the winner or both.

680
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:46,578
Rym: Like, "Eat a

681
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:46,984
Rym: lemon.".

682
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:52,590
Scott: Right, like, "Oh, whoever loses this game has to eat a lemon slice and can't spit it out.

683
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:53,862
Scott: You just got to chew it and swallow the whole

684
00:34:53,904 --> 00:34:54,106
Scott: thing.".

685
00:34:55,174 --> 00:34:57,065
Scott: And so suddenly, it's like, "Oh, shit.

686
00:34:57,085 --> 00:34:57,468
Scott: This game

687
00:34:57,508 --> 00:34:57,850
Scott: matters.".

688
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:00,969
Scott: And I was thinking when I was watching this, like, that's just a typical thing they do.

689
00:35:01,731 --> 00:35:02,235
Scott: Wait a minute.

690
00:35:02,256 --> 00:35:03,990
Scott: We play a lot of games with people, right?

691
00:35:04,131 --> 00:35:06,930
Scott: And often, you play games with people who don't care about winning.

692
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:08,690
Scott: Because when you win, what does that mean?

693
00:35:08,832 --> 00:35:09,669
Scott: You can say you won.

694
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,129
Scott: And if you lose, what does it mean?

695
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:12,270
Scott: You can say you lost.

696
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:14,630
Rym: Now, one could argue that that's an intrinsic reward.

697
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,610
Scott: And also, I'm playing a lot of Netrunners lately.

698
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:18,889
Scott: Not that I have, right?

699
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:19,869
Scott: That's news to anyone.

700
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:24,310
Scott: But at Netrunner tournaments, like, I only care about winning.

701
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,587
Scott: Like, being able to say, "I

702
00:35:25,607 --> 00:35:25,769
Scott: won.".

703
00:35:26,651 --> 00:35:31,530
Scott: Other people there, like, care about winning because they want this swag that you get when you win.

704
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,950
Scott: Like, I've given away most of the swag I've won.

705
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,870
Scott: Like, I won a playmat at the recent tournament.

706
00:35:37,395 --> 00:35:38,290
Scott: It's an ugly playmat.

707
00:35:38,451 --> 00:35:41,130
Scott: I like my solid black playmat that I bought for eight bucks on Amazon.

708
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,150
Scott: It has all these stains on it.

709
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:44,049
Scott: More than I like that one because I don't like that art.

710
00:35:44,771 --> 00:35:46,324
Scott: And the guy, I was like, "Who's in second place?

711
00:35:46,364 --> 00:35:46,687
Scott: Here you go,

712
00:35:46,748 --> 00:35:46,949
Scott: bro.".

713
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:48,648
Scott: And he's like, "Oh my god, thank

714
00:35:48,669 --> 00:35:48,750
Scott: you.".

715
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,178
Scott: And I'm like, "It's a fucking playmat.

716
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:51,947
Scott: It's like who gives a shit,

717
00:35:51,988 --> 00:35:52,169
Scott: dude?".

718
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:52,692
Scott: Right?

719
00:35:53,035 --> 00:35:54,950
Scott: I could just buy them if I wanted it that badly.

720
00:35:56,371 --> 00:35:58,430
Scott: And these people are playing for the swag.

721
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,790
Scott: There's a reward involved.

722
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:02,670
Scott: And so I started thinking about, you know, we've done a show on gambling.

723
00:36:03,211 --> 00:36:08,070
Scott: But I think gambling is only a small subset of just stakes for games in general.

724
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:10,070
Rym: And stakes in games are way more common than you think.

725
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:10,770
Rym: Look at old Magic.

726
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:15,430
Rym: I mean, Magic the Gathering had rules for putting up antis in the game.

727
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,170
Rym: There were cards that affected the antis.

728
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:27,370
Scott: In the original Magic the Gathering, the rule was supposed to be that you would, before playing a game, shuffle your deck randomly and pick out a card and put it to the side.

729
00:36:27,931 --> 00:36:29,890
Scott: And then play Magic with the remaining cards.

730
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:33,570
Scott: So a card is randomly removed from your deck you can't play with, right?

731
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:38,370
Scott: Then whoever wins takes both cards and is now the owner of both cards.

732
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:41,989
Scott: And they even had cards in the game that said things like...

733
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,310
Rym: Like there were cards that were protect.

734
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,670
Rym: Like a bronze tablet could change.

735
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:48,509
Rym: Like you could steal a fucking card from someone and keep it.

736
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:50,069
Scott: There was that bird.

737
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:51,349
Scott: I own your card.

738
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:55,950
Rym: The jeweled bird was the card that you could swap in to protect a different card that went into the ante.

739
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,449
Scott: Yeah, but now they have a jeweled bird.

740
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:00,950
Rym: Yeah, which wasn't valuable until people started playing the game.

741
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,990
Rym: And the jeweled bird was actually super rare and expensive.

742
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:08,430
Scott: But anyway, it's like, you know, the game had stakes built in and they got rid of them, right?

743
00:37:08,711 --> 00:37:10,510
Scott: Because of the way it affected play.

744
00:37:11,691 --> 00:37:14,870
Scott: So it got me thinking about situations where you go to conventions.

745
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:25,890
Scott: And there's a lot of incompatibility, especially in tabletop board gaming worlds, communities, between the people who care about winning and are competitive, like us, and the people who don't care about winning.

746
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:27,690
Scott: Even in video games there's this conflict.

747
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:30,390
Scott: And those kinds of people generally can't play with each other well.

748
00:37:30,732 --> 00:37:31,690
Scott: It's not a good experience.

749
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:49,790
Scott: And I was like, if you added stakes, rewards and/or punishments, right, rewards for winners, punishments for losers of some kind, could you get the people who didn't care about winning to suddenly care about winning and change their behavior so that everyone could play together, right?

750
00:37:50,031 --> 00:38:03,870
Scott: Or could you use some reward or punishment to make the people who were competitive not care or at least get their behavior to change in such a way to get the games to go smoother when there were non-competitive players also playing?

751
00:38:04,871 --> 00:38:10,170
Rym: So, as I've put a lot of thought into this, I don't think it actually helps.

752
00:38:10,911 --> 00:38:27,550
Rym: I've read a lot of studies that show that in general if you give someone extrinsic rewards for a game or a task, like you'll win this ugly play mat if you win the tournament, people start playing for that goal and not for the intrinsic enjoyment of the game or winning itself.

753
00:38:27,893 --> 00:38:28,708
Rym: I have noticed that.

754
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:35,170
Rym: Studies that show it can actually decrease your enjoyment and decrease your willingness to play the game when there is no longer an extrinsic reward.

755
00:38:36,274 --> 00:38:37,499
Scott: That is the thing that I've noticed.

756
00:38:37,539 --> 00:38:40,451
Scott: the most, right, is that I'll see people who will be like, "Hey,".

757
00:38:40,491 --> 00:38:41,907
Scott: I'll be like, "Hey, you go to the Netrunner on

758
00:38:41,967 --> 00:38:42,230
Scott: Sunday?".

759
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:42,994
Scott: They'll be like, "Do they have

760
00:38:43,034 --> 00:38:43,476
Scott: prizes?".

761
00:38:43,797 --> 00:38:46,048
Scott: And I'm like, "Uh, I don't know, do

762
00:38:46,088 --> 00:38:46,249
Scott: they?".

763
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:48,184
Scott: And they'll be like, "It's the same prize as last time?

764
00:38:48,204 --> 00:38:48,749
Scott: I don't want to

765
00:38:48,769 --> 00:38:48,870
Scott: go.".

766
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:49,632
Scott: Right?

767
00:38:49,692 --> 00:38:55,610
Scott: It's like they're only going to the tournament because they might, because if they don't have the prize that they want, they're not going to go.

768
00:38:55,992 --> 00:39:01,521
Scott: Some other guy was seriously talking about going to Bulgaria because there was a Netrunner tournament with a 1,300 euro prize for the winner.

769
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:04,976
Scott: It's like, "But you're not going to win.

770
00:39:04,997 --> 00:39:06,265
Scott: You're just going to go on a trip to Bulgaria.

771
00:39:06,286 --> 00:39:06,910
Scott: Are you crazy?

772
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:08,154
Scott: What is wrong with

773
00:39:08,174 --> 00:39:08,315
Scott: you?".

774
00:39:08,335 --> 00:39:10,485
Scott: I mean, not that Bulgaria is not nice.

775
00:39:10,505 --> 00:39:11,490
Scott: I wouldn't want to just go there.

776
00:39:11,771 --> 00:39:14,429
Scott: But I'm not going there for a Netrunner tournament.

777
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:21,910
Rym: But at the same time, our friend from the example in the beginning of the show is playing only for the extrinsic reward of the money.

778
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:24,434
Rym: Or, is it more subtle?

779
00:39:25,617 --> 00:39:30,570
Rym: Are there people for whom extrinsic rewards do not affect them in that same way?

780
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:33,610
Rym: I mean, I don't know much about these studies to be able to really speak to them.

781
00:39:34,153 --> 00:39:37,010
Scott: And is punishment different than the reward, right?

782
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:42,328
Scott: What if we went to a Netrunner tournament and it's like, "Okay guys, whoever comes in last place has to eat a

783
00:39:42,368 --> 00:39:42,589
Scott: bug."

784
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,209
Scott: Has to eat something nasty.

785
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:44,774
Rym: All bug.

786
00:39:44,794 --> 00:39:46,590
Rym: We have this bowl of dead bugs that we found.

787
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:48,210
Scott: Would you enter that tournament?

788
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,229
Rym: Yeah, well there's an adventure time.

789
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:51,397
Scott: Would you enter it in the first place?

790
00:39:51,417 --> 00:39:55,209
Scott: Because remember, the store wants to maximize entrance because they get an entry fee from everyone, right?

791
00:39:55,911 --> 00:40:02,190
Scott: Two, if you were in that tournament, how would you play differently than if you were just playing for no stakes at all?

792
00:40:02,911 --> 00:40:08,110
Rym: Oh my god, the last ante card in Magic was $19.95.

793
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:08,768
Scott: Yeah, that's about right.

794
00:40:09,391 --> 00:40:10,278
Rym: Oh my god.

795
00:40:10,298 --> 00:40:11,305
Rym: I'm old.

796
00:40:14,451 --> 00:40:15,814
Rym: But I don't know.

797
00:40:15,874 --> 00:40:25,630
Rym: I think if I had to guess, being not a psychologist, these kinds of rewards are only effective, or punishments, if one, they're very low stakes.

798
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:29,270
Rym: It has to be on the level of the lick and stick.

799
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:30,675
Scott: Right, that's what I'm talking about.

800
00:40:30,736 --> 00:40:33,310
Scott: I was thinking, practically speaking, right?

801
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,629
Rym: Or the slick and slap.

802
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:39,010
Scott: Right, is that we play a lot of games, often with people who don't care about winning.

803
00:40:39,251 --> 00:40:45,530
Scott: And it's like, could I get them to up their game by having some, you know, inconsequential punishment?

804
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,308
Scott: Something that everyone would agree to, right?

805
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:53,590
Scott: Because if you have some ridiculous punishment, like, yeah, you get, you know, smacked on the butt, then it's like, no one's gonna agree to that.

806
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:54,448
Rym: I would agree to that.

807
00:40:54,731 --> 00:40:56,790
Scott: Yeah, but some people will not agree to that.

808
00:40:56,930 --> 00:41:00,090
Scott: And if you actually tried to enforce it, they would not allow it, right?

809
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:02,830
Scott: And you'd just be like, fuck no, and if you did it, then you would go to jail.

810
00:41:03,131 --> 00:41:12,610
Scott: But if I have a punishment like whoever loses has to take this really sour candy and grab a fistful of it and hold it in their mouth, right?

811
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:17,990
Scott: For like 20 seconds, people might agree to do that, and if they lost, would actually do it.

812
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:22,190
Rym: I've found that the best way I've gotten, because you don't come to board game nights anymore, because you're a netrunner.

813
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,329
Scott: No, I don't have time for that shit anymore.

814
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:26,190
Rym: Yeah, even though you're gonna miss out on some Hans and Jotonica and Ginkgopolis.

815
00:41:26,411 --> 00:41:28,250
Scott: I'll play them plenty when it's time.

816
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:40,510
Rym: So, what I've found is that the best way to get someone motivated to play to win is to get them to play enough, even if they're not 100% playing to win, until they get close to victory or win a few times.

817
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:41,508
Scott: So they get a taste of it.

818
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:42,710
Rym: Yes, once they taste that blood.

819
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:47,830
Scott: When they taste the intrinsic award, they don't need an extrinsic motivator.

820
00:41:48,091 --> 00:41:52,790
Scott: I mean, look at one of our- Because they realized how, like we have, how awesome it is to just win, baby.

821
00:41:53,091 --> 00:41:58,550
Rym: Yep, look at some of our friends, I won't name names, they might be embarrassed, one of whom is really good at Zendo.

822
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:04,610
Rym: Once that person realized they were very good at Zendo, they suddenly tasted the blood in the water.

823
00:42:06,413 --> 00:42:08,470
Rym: And I've seen that happen with a lot of our friends.

824
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:14,170
Rym: So I think that's a better way than stakes to get people to take games seriously.

825
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:20,870
Scott: That's true in general, look how demotivated the people were playing against you at Nidhogg, simply because they felt they could not win.

826
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:25,750
Scott: So they just didn't even try to win because they felt they couldn't, even though they may have wanted to originally.

827
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:30,970
Rym: I got to the point that I'd start faking it, like I would let them kill me a bunch of times, I'd let them get all the way to the edge.

828
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:35,210
Scott: They didn't have the willpower to keep trying and trying and trying, right?

829
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:35,537
Rym: Yep.

830
00:42:36,212 --> 00:42:42,110
Scott: Whereas me, it took me over a year to win a Netrunner tournament, and I only won when no one really showed up.

831
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:45,550
Scott: And the people who should have beat me got in a draw, so I got lucky.

832
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:48,950
Rym: So I think stakes like that, especially these low stakes.

833
00:42:49,531 --> 00:42:54,190
Scott: But the point is, I'm willing to just keep, I know what winning other games is like, and I want to win just to win.

834
00:42:54,690 --> 00:43:00,110
Scott: So I keep playing no matter what, where other people would become demoralized after not winning in short order and quit.

835
00:43:00,632 --> 00:43:05,630
Scott: Or they would win immediately and just keep playing because now they feel like they can win.

836
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:10,350
Rym: So it is not out of the realm to use Nidhogg as an example.

837
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:20,250
Rym: Maybe when I play against new people, I should make it feel close, but let them win a couple of games against me first, and then pull out the claws.

838
00:43:20,711 --> 00:43:21,930
Scott: It's called hustling.

839
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:23,415
Rym: Yeah, here's my problem.

840
00:43:23,757 --> 00:43:26,890
Rym: I've tried to actually hustle people in my life.

841
00:43:27,932 --> 00:43:29,539
Scott: You know what stands in the way of hustling?

842
00:43:30,062 --> 00:43:31,770
Scott: Two things, morals and pride.

843
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:34,388
Rym: Yeah, one thing stands in that way, and that's pride.

844
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:35,450
Scott: Pride only.

845
00:43:36,671 --> 00:43:42,285
Rym: I tried to legit hustle some people at poker.

846
00:43:42,406 --> 00:43:44,090
Rym: during that time we were trying to win that PS2.

847
00:43:46,012 --> 00:43:48,050
Scott: First of all, there was another guy there who was just winning.

848
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:59,270
Rym: Yeah, well he hustled because he wormed his way into the game, lost a bunch, and then suddenly started winning every hand, and his friends used social pressure to keep other people in the game.

849
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:00,683
Scott: What did we put all our money on?

850
00:44:00,703 --> 00:44:01,350
Scott: Was it red or black?

851
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:02,170
Rym: I don't remember.

852
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:03,039
Scott: We should have put it on the other one.

853
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:03,828
Scott: We would have had that PS2.

854
00:44:04,271 --> 00:44:05,062
Rym: You know what we put it on?

855
00:44:05,326 --> 00:44:05,610
Rym: Wrong.

856
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:06,981
Scott: That's right, we put it on wrong.

857
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:07,930
Scott: We should have put it on right.

858
00:44:08,393 --> 00:44:09,129
Rym: Never been on wrong.

859
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:09,872
Scott: That's right.

860
00:44:10,796 --> 00:44:11,922
Scott: There was a one out of two chance.

861
00:44:11,942 --> 00:44:13,289
Scott: we could have had a PS2 right away.

862
00:44:13,329 --> 00:44:13,570
Scott: We didn't.

863
00:44:14,031 --> 00:44:24,850
Rym: But those low stakes like that I think only work, or at least only are not detrimental, if they're associated with games that are simple or closer to the party genre.

864
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:28,790
Rym: If you play spot it with the slap, that would probably be fine.

865
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:29,863
Rym: That would go really well.

866
00:44:29,924 --> 00:44:30,410
Rym: I'd love that.

867
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:31,390
Rym: People would be really into that.

868
00:44:31,431 --> 00:44:32,689
Scott: I think spot it would be better with a lemon.

869
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:33,869
Rym: A lemon might be good.

870
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:37,070
Scott: Anyone who ever left holding all the cards as to eat the lemon slice.

871
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:37,420
Rym: Yep.

872
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:39,681
Scott: Or drink a shot of lemon juice.

873
00:44:39,983 --> 00:44:40,587
Scott: Just 100% lemon juice.

874
00:44:42,113 --> 00:44:47,370
Rym: But partly that's because the intrinsic value of winning that game is not as important.

875
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:52,829
Scott: Also, the other thing is that depending on what the punishment or reward is.

876
00:44:53,351 --> 00:44:54,970
Scott: If the reward is just, say, money.

877
00:44:55,812 --> 00:44:58,390
Scott: The winner enjoys the money, but no one else enjoys the reward.

878
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:02,550
Scott: The eating lemon punishment is enjoyed by all.

879
00:45:04,232 --> 00:45:07,430
Scott: All players enjoy that, including the person eating the lemon.

880
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:11,730
Scott: They simultaneously enjoy and hate the punishment.

881
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:17,210
Rym: That's why the key is that the stakes have to be low enough to where getting the punishment.

882
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,720
Scott: If it's a punishment, they have to be low.

883
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:19,424
Scott: It's a reward.

884
00:45:19,465 --> 00:45:20,290
Scott: They can be any scale.

885
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:23,609
Rym: Yes, but the punishment has to, well, if the reward is too high.

886
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:25,310
Scott: People get too serious.

887
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:30,250
Scott: It becomes serious business and people would be killing each other to get the million dollars.

888
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:32,550
Rym: Which would be fine if it's a game like Puerto Rico.

889
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:35,789
Rym: If I was playing Puerto Rico for a million dollars, that would be the best thing ever.

890
00:45:36,111 --> 00:45:39,130
Scott: Go look at Major League Gaming and stuff.

891
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:42,090
Scott: The Dotads and such of the world.

892
00:45:42,832 --> 00:45:43,738
Scott: The Magic Tournaments.

893
00:45:43,758 --> 00:45:45,410
Scott: The kind of culture that exists there.

894
00:45:46,014 --> 00:45:47,430
Scott: Where the prizes are so large.

895
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:52,650
Scott: That culture exists because the prizes are so large and those people need that money.

896
00:45:53,091 --> 00:45:55,690
Scott: They're banking on that money to live because they're pro players.

897
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:57,009
Scott: Like pro poker, pro golf.

898
00:45:57,833 --> 00:45:59,370
Scott: You see that kind of culture will emerge.

899
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:04,590
Scott: If the prizes are low, like in Netrunner, then you see a different culture.

900
00:46:04,831 --> 00:46:08,110
Scott: Even though there's still those people who are affected by the extrinsic award.

901
00:46:08,771 --> 00:46:11,781
Scott: The culture of, "I'm playing Netrunner for my life.

902
00:46:12,082 --> 00:46:13,327
Scott: I'm super serious about this.

903
00:46:13,407 --> 00:46:13,949
Scott: Fuck all you

904
00:46:13,989 --> 00:46:14,210
Scott: guys."

905
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:14,954
Scott: Does not exist.

906
00:46:15,014 --> 00:46:16,924
Scott: Everyone's just like, "Hey, good job winning.

907
00:46:16,944 --> 00:46:17,467
Scott: Yeah, what's

908
00:46:17,588 --> 00:46:17,648
Scott: up?".

909
00:46:19,471 --> 00:46:24,570
Scott: Because they care about the prize, but don't care that much about the prize.

910
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:26,430
Scott: Because it's not ridiculous.

911
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:30,069
Rym: So the stake has to be kind of on the level of those jackass shows.

912
00:46:30,691 --> 00:46:32,529
Rym: Where you're all kind of in this together.

913
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:34,470
Scott: The injury to the emergency room trip.

914
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,970
Rym: But that's low stakes for that group of people.

915
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:43,450
Rym: For the group that's playing, the stakes have to be low relative to the tolerances of everyone in that group.

916
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:52,885
Scott: So if you have a group of ridiculous daredevils, the punishment could be like, "Oh, you gotta skydive up to

917
00:46:52,905 --> 00:46:53,247
Scott: whatever.".

918
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:55,084
Scott: Because for them, it's like, "Okay,

919
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:55,448
Scott: whatevs.".

920
00:46:56,673 --> 00:47:01,470
Rym: It has to be a punishment that the person getting punished will enjoy and laugh along with.

921
00:47:01,611 --> 00:47:03,049
Rym: Like that level or else it's no good.

922
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:06,450
Rym: Otherwise you're just going to further demotivate the people.

923
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:10,206
Scott: Even if I say, "Yes, I agree to play in this game and have this

924
00:47:10,267 --> 00:47:10,749
Scott: punishment."

925
00:47:11,171 --> 00:47:14,827
Scott: If at the end I lose and I say, "Actually, no, you're not doing that punishment to

926
00:47:14,887 --> 00:47:15,008
Scott: me."

927
00:47:15,731 --> 00:47:18,330
Scott: And then you do it, then I can call the police and that's a problem.

928
00:47:19,895 --> 00:47:21,570
Rym: What if we signed a contract ahead of time?

929
00:47:22,331 --> 00:47:23,649
Scott: I don't even know if that would fly.

930
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:25,630
Rym: I think it would depend on the nature of the punishment.

931
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:27,410
Scott: Obviously, obviously.

932
00:47:27,914 --> 00:47:28,429
Rym: Eat this bug.

933
00:47:28,791 --> 00:47:36,547
Scott: Yeah, if I signed a contract that said, "I will eat the bug," and then I refused to eat it, it's like, "Could you sue me for breach of

934
00:47:36,567 --> 00:47:37,010
Scott: contract?"

935
00:47:37,112 --> 00:47:37,549
Scott: Probably.

936
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:40,743
Rym: I'm sure some lawyer will chime in and be like, "Well...".

937
00:47:42,011 --> 00:47:43,726
Scott: It's like, "You can't make me eat a fucking bug.

938
00:47:43,786 --> 00:47:44,069
Scott: Really?".

939
00:47:44,613 --> 00:47:46,550
Rym: Why would you sign a contract saying you'd eat a bug?

940
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:50,390
Scott: Because I thought I would do it, but then I developed a bug phobia afterwards.

941
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:55,250
Scott: When I was actually confronted with the situation, I realized I changed my mind.

942
00:47:55,411 --> 00:48:03,010
Rym: So, I'm going to read for you a card from Magic that did stuff with the ante to give everyone out there an idea of what this shit was like.

943
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:04,440
Rym: It wasn't just, "Play for

944
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:05,005
Rym: keepsies.".

945
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:09,190
Rym: So, Temerian Fiends caused one colorless and two black.

946
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:09,663
Rym: It's a creature.

947
00:48:09,684 --> 00:48:09,830
Rym: One, one.

948
00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:12,090
Scott: So you can just play that, like, fucking the third turn of the game.

949
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:12,431
Scott: Yes.

950
00:48:12,692 --> 00:48:17,006
Rym: First text, "Remove Temerian Fiends from your deck if you're not playing for

951
00:48:17,087 --> 00:48:17,347
Rym: ante.".

952
00:48:18,272 --> 00:48:19,870
Scott: So you can only play it if you're playing for ante.

953
00:48:21,175 --> 00:48:29,344
Scott: Actually, that card is ridiculously strong because when you don't play for ante, your deck just legally got smaller by four copies.

954
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:33,450
Scott: So now you have a 56-card deck instead of a 60-card deck.

955
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:35,510
Rym: I don't know which rule would take precedence.

956
00:48:36,335 --> 00:48:36,568
Rym: Right?

957
00:48:36,991 --> 00:48:40,070
Rym: It might remove you below the limit and then you're just immediately disqualified.

958
00:48:40,692 --> 00:48:42,044
Scott: I think that's it.

959
00:48:42,084 --> 00:48:42,730
Scott: Anyway, continue.

960
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:46,427
Rym: "Spend three black mana and sacrifice Temerian

961
00:48:46,467 --> 00:48:46,749
Rym: Fiends.".

962
00:48:47,011 --> 00:48:50,830
Scott: Well, you already have three black mana, most likely, because you used two colorless and a black to install it.

963
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:51,450
Scott: Don't listen to this shit.

964
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:52,295
Scott: Summon it.

965
00:48:52,316 --> 00:48:52,804
Scott: Summon it.

966
00:48:52,845 --> 00:48:53,150
Scott: Sorry.

967
00:48:53,450 --> 00:49:05,969
Rym: "The owner of target artifact may ante the top card of his or her library if the player does not exchange ownership of that artifact and Temerian

968
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:06,270
Rym: Fiends.".

969
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:09,829
Scott: So if someone has an artifact card, it's like, "Give me that

970
00:49:09,849 --> 00:49:10,070
Scott: artifact."

971
00:49:10,471 --> 00:49:10,787
Scott: To keep.

972
00:49:11,232 --> 00:49:13,909
Scott: Or, "Give me the top card of your deck and...".

973
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:16,110
Rym: I'll give you the Temerian Fiends in return.

974
00:49:16,451 --> 00:49:16,773
Scott: Right.

975
00:49:16,813 --> 00:49:19,725
Scott: So basically it punishes anyone who plays an artifact.

976
00:49:19,745 --> 00:49:20,970
Scott: that's worth a lot of money.

977
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:24,790
Scott: Oh, you're playing Alpha Magic, Black Lotus, Moxes, all artifacts.

978
00:49:26,773 --> 00:49:27,930
Rym: Yeah, ante was awesome.

979
00:49:28,351 --> 00:49:29,048
Scott: Yes, it was.

980
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:30,320
Scott: "Give me that Black

981
00:49:30,361 --> 00:49:30,725
Scott: Lotus.".

982
00:49:31,497 --> 00:49:32,229
Scott: I don't want to.

983
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:33,257
Scott: "Give me the top card of your

984
00:49:33,278 --> 00:49:33,519
Scott: deck.".

985
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:34,487
Scott: Mox Emerald.

986
00:49:34,608 --> 00:49:34,790
Rym: Fuck.

987
00:49:36,152 --> 00:49:38,869
Scott: Oh, another Black Lotus, because you're allowed to have four, right?

988
00:49:39,911 --> 00:49:40,353
Rym: Uh, yeah.

989
00:49:40,413 --> 00:49:45,770
Rym: Though Black Lotus and Sol Ring and all those things were restricted to one pretty early on before they were banned.

990
00:49:46,036 --> 00:49:46,590
Scott: I have a Sol Ring.

991
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:50,550
Rym: Oh, ante is strictly forbidden in DCI-sanctioned play currently.

992
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:50,871
Rym: Yup.

993
00:49:51,214 --> 00:49:53,009
Scott: They banned it really early on.

994
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,767
Rym: In unsanctioned games, we're not prohibited by law.

995
00:49:56,518 --> 00:49:56,645
Rym: Yup.

996
00:49:56,891 --> 00:49:57,407
Rym: That's boring.

997
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:58,041
Scott: Yup.

998
00:49:59,551 --> 00:49:59,697
Scott: Yup.

999
00:50:00,970 --> 00:50:07,369
Scott: Maybe we could make a game, right, to where somehow to work the ante in, right, where it's like...

1000
00:50:07,652 --> 00:50:08,450
Rym: I see where you're going with this.

1001
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:11,430
Scott: It's more like Dominion, but you play multiple games, right?

1002
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:18,610
Scott: But you still ante the game cards from the game, and then you get them back, and then you have to play another game.

1003
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:24,689
Scott: So you're not anteing for the thing you're going to keep, because at the end of the day, you're shuffling all the cards back in the box, because it's a board game, right, that comes in a box.

1004
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:25,060
Scott: Yup.

1005
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:30,850
Scott: But you're playing multiple times with the same cards that you drafted or something.

1006
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:32,040
Rym: Here's two other ways to go.

1007
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:32,989
Scott: I see where you're going with this.

1008
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:40,870
Scott: And by winning, you're getting your deck at least... You're changing your deck at least by getting cards added, and then you have to play again before putting the game away.

1009
00:50:41,031 --> 00:50:42,809
Rym: I'm branching this in two directions now.

1010
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:45,541
Rym: Direction A is kind of like Risk Legacy.

1011
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:47,309
Rym: If you do certain things in the game...

1012
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:48,189
Scott: Oh, Dominion Legacy?

1013
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:51,470
Rym: You can steal a token from someone, like Safe Cracker.

1014
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:54,480
Rym: So you get the Safe Cracker token.

1015
00:50:54,742 --> 00:50:56,370
Rym: It has some minor effect in the game.

1016
00:50:56,770 --> 00:51:02,330
Rym: You can accumulate them across games, but there's still metal tokens.

1017
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:06,583
Rym: I guess you could cheat by buying copies of the game.

1018
00:51:06,924 --> 00:51:08,369
Rym: Each game has two of them.

1019
00:51:08,792 --> 00:51:10,220
Rym: So buy like ten copies of the game.

1020
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:11,930
Rym: Well, that's great, because I made the game anyway.

1021
00:51:12,893 --> 00:51:15,150
Rym: The other way I would go, which is a little more subtle.

1022
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:26,009
Rym: Make a game like Netrunner that comes in a big box that has maybe a deck for everyone, and you're supposed to play for Anti with all the people who bought in on that big box.

1023
00:51:27,351 --> 00:51:28,034
Rym: Something like that.

1024
00:51:28,054 --> 00:51:31,890
Rym: Maybe it has ten decks, and you play with these decks.

1025
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:35,789
Rym: Like ten friends each have a deck, and you play from your set, and that's it.

1026
00:51:38,793 --> 00:51:42,890
Scott: The thing is, someone would just buy one box for themselves and just make an awesome deck.

1027
00:51:45,576 --> 00:51:45,890
Scott: I don't know.

1028
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:48,990
Rym: That's why these are concept ideas.

1029
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:50,235
Scott: This is why I play Netrunner.

1030
00:51:50,255 --> 00:51:51,823
Scott: It's perfect, right?

1031
00:51:52,105 --> 00:51:53,090
Scott: Everyone has every card.

1032
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:54,810
Scott: Everyone can make any deck they want.

1033
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:56,519
Rym: Nidhogg, everyone has every move.

1034
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,370
Rym: You can just play whatever strategy you want to play.

1035
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:03,010
Scott: It's good for the same reason, but it doesn't have the customizing, which is fun.

1036
00:52:08,385 --> 00:52:10,520
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1037
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:15,660
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1038
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:21,060
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1039
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:23,980
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1040
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:28,740
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1041
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:32,256
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1042
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:36,580
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1043
00:52:36,781 --> 00:52:39,680
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
