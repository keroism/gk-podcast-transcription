1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,152
Rym: It's Thursday February 2nd, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,192 --> 00:00:15,280
Rym: We wax poetic about the toys of our youth.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,749
Scott: Let's do this, so I'm getting this new car.

4
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:24,680
Scott: tomorrow at 4 p.m.. I have to go pick it up and I had to go through the ordeal of buying insurance.

5
00:00:26,361 --> 00:00:37,308
Rym: Now for any of you who don't know our views on car insurance and the laws Surrounding it in this country this country being the United States for all of our foreign listeners ah It's kind of a scam.

6
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:38,860
Rym: It's kind of a bullshit.

7
00:00:39,683 --> 00:00:46,497
Scott: Yeah, I mean you're basically Betting that you're gonna crash or your car is gonna get stolen or get messed up somehow.

8
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:52,970
Scott: now not only do I not think that's gonna happen and I I don't want to bet that it is gonna happen.

9
00:00:53,010 --> 00:01:02,058
Scott: in fact if I could bet that it wasn't gonna happen I would do so and This is really a problem because the government says you must bet that it will happen.

10
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,344
Rym: well It depends on the state.

11
00:01:03,384 --> 00:01:04,950
Rym: some states don't require car insurance.

12
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:05,854
Scott: Oh really well.

13
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:11,640
Rym: Yeah, so those no state We want to live in great New York and Michigan actually have some of the strictest laws.

14
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,122
Rym: They do.

15
00:01:12,282 --> 00:01:13,306
Rym: we happen to live in New York.

16
00:01:13,587 --> 00:01:15,634
Scott: Yeah, so because I'm financing this car.

17
00:01:15,674 --> 00:01:16,778
Scott: I need a pile of insurance.

18
00:01:16,838 --> 00:01:24,060
Scott: now I'm gonna explain some details because I don't think everyone listening knows everything there is to know about car insurance.

19
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:25,187
Rym: But we do now.

20
00:01:25,348 --> 00:01:25,912
Scott: we do now.

21
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:36,112
Scott: so first I do the smart thing that a smart person like me does and I call every single major car insurance provider my current provider And my company also acts as an insurance agency.

22
00:01:36,312 --> 00:01:37,397
Scott: at least one part of it does.

23
00:01:37,437 --> 00:01:38,120
Scott: so I called them to.

24
00:01:39,242 --> 00:01:42,340
Scott: The lowest quote was from my current provider in Connecticut.

25
00:01:43,781 --> 00:01:50,456
Scott: So they told me 629 for six months or something like that, which is great Considering I'm financing the car and I'm not 25 yet.

26
00:01:50,476 --> 00:01:51,300
Scott: That's like a crazy price.

27
00:01:52,661 --> 00:02:00,909
Scott: So after I call everyone else and everyone else gives me a higher price including the famous infamous Geico I called all state and I said alright.

28
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:01,632
Scott: Give me that price.

29
00:02:02,396 --> 00:02:04,791
Scott: then they did a. It wasn't a credit check.

30
00:02:04,973 --> 00:02:08,247
Scott: They called it a Financial stability check now.

31
00:02:08,347 --> 00:02:12,900
Rym: This is the point at which I think you could have pressed and gotten some sort of contents for that.

32
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:15,047
Rym: Anyway, go on doesn't matter.

33
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:20,547
Scott: So they changed the quote from six something to 1,100 and something.

34
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:35,547
Scott: and I'm like, yeah, I'm totally not buying that now and The reason I didn't press was because obviously this this girl didn't actually, you know She's an insurance agent Which means she's not an actuary.

35
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:38,476
Scott: the actuaries of the people who figure out how much the insurance cost.

36
00:02:38,496 --> 00:02:40,161
Scott: the agent is just a sales Person.

37
00:02:40,663 --> 00:02:45,980
Scott: they basically type in my information into a computer which gives them a number between 1 and 16.

38
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,173
Scott: They type that number into a box and then it tells them how much money.

39
00:02:49,213 --> 00:02:50,820
Scott: to tell me they don't know crap.

40
00:02:51,222 --> 00:02:55,139
Scott: So pressing I figured really wouldn't get me anyway like Phoenix Wright press.

41
00:02:55,862 --> 00:02:58,092
Rym: Yeah, so thing is the way.

42
00:02:58,232 --> 00:02:59,920
Rym: they must have done some sort of credit check.

43
00:03:00,743 --> 00:03:02,571
Rym: I would assume that they did some sort of credit.

44
00:03:02,772 --> 00:03:04,560
Scott: Yeah, but the thing is this girl didn't do anything.

45
00:03:04,621 --> 00:03:05,209
Scott: She all she did.

46
00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:10,737
Rym: it was a matter though If the company gave you a higher price as a result of anything involving a credit check.

47
00:03:11,038 --> 00:03:12,385
Rym: by law They have to inform you that.

48
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:15,279
Rym: that's why they did it and they have to provide you with a free credit report.

49
00:03:15,901 --> 00:03:17,426
Scott: Well, they say she said he did.

50
00:03:17,446 --> 00:03:21,740
Scott: she did it because of the number that came out when she did this financial stability.

51
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:24,093
Rym: I would have pressed I would have been on the phone with every manager.

52
00:03:24,154 --> 00:03:25,963
Rym: They'd send me to Whatever.

53
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:29,180
Scott: so the next lowest was of course the infamous Geico.

54
00:03:29,984 --> 00:03:32,718
Scott: So I called them up and I said I want the insurance at this price.

55
00:03:32,738 --> 00:03:34,068
Scott: you said so.

56
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:37,008
Scott: they said okay and That was that.

57
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:44,300
Scott: now I'm a big fan of and a big pusher of companies making their businesses run smoothly with computers.

58
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:45,650
Rym: That means you write stuff.

59
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:51,230
Scott: Yeah, so Geico actually had something really slick.

60
00:03:51,491 --> 00:04:09,212
Scott: progressive also had it where basically I Went to their website and did a whole bunch of quotes before I called them on the phone, you know and Their computers are so smart that it combined all those quotes in the database So that when I called them and told them who I was they're like, oh I see you did some quotes on the internet there And I'm like, yep.

61
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:17,060
Scott: So what happened was the first time I called Geico in the middle of a quote the shitty shitty phones at work cut out.

62
00:04:17,945 --> 00:04:18,658
Scott: I had to call back.

63
00:04:19,382 --> 00:04:24,139
Scott: So the guy loaded up the quote that I was working on with that person or at least so he says.

64
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:27,519
Scott: and Then the third time that I called was the time that I got the policy.

65
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:39,038
Scott: Then I get a phone call on the way home from Geico because they have to communicate with the dealer because the dealer can't give Me the car unless he knows I have insurance and he has to get the insurance card for me and all that kind of stuff.

66
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,760
Scott: So They call me and they're like, yeah, I got your dealer on the line.

67
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,274
Scott: I'm like, yeah, you got my dealer on the line.

68
00:04:46,314 --> 00:04:46,839
Scott: what's going on?

69
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:49,433
Scott: And they said we have to change your policy.

70
00:04:49,775 --> 00:04:50,580
Scott: I'm like why?

71
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,921
Scott: Because the car that they think that I have is not the car I have.

72
00:04:55,463 --> 00:05:07,100
Scott: they thought I was getting a 2005 Mazda 6, but I'm getting a 2006 Mazda 3 Outstanding because I'm pretty sure they loaded up a quote saved online that I just did to you know.

73
00:05:07,462 --> 00:05:08,407
Scott: Check out you're lucky.

74
00:05:08,447 --> 00:05:10,519
Rym: They didn't get the GTI instead.

75
00:05:11,082 --> 00:05:21,602
Scott: Yeah, but if they did that then I would have called someone else first because the price would have been different Because it would have been a much higher price of the GTI than for the either of the Mazdas because it's a crazy fast Car.

76
00:05:22,285 --> 00:05:25,640
Scott: but anyway, so I said, okay fine and that because it made my insurance lower.

77
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:28,937
Scott: Mazda 3 is a lot cheaper insurance than the 6 so I was fine with that.

78
00:05:30,003 --> 00:05:32,700
Scott: Then they call me back later the same thing again, and I'm like, huh?

79
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,423
Scott: What the hell's going on?

80
00:05:34,488 --> 00:05:37,320
Scott: and they say I chose a thousand dollar deductible.

81
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:42,114
Scott: That means if anything happens where I need to actually collect insurance.

82
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:44,262
Scott: I have to pay $1,000.

83
00:05:44,262 --> 00:05:47,300
Rym: Now I have $1,000 deductible in my car, which I'm still paying off.

84
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:53,988
Scott: Yeah And that basically what it does for you is let's say I crashed the car and it takes $500 worth of damage.

85
00:05:54,309 --> 00:05:57,241
Scott: I have to pay all of it because it's less than $1,000.

86
00:05:57,241 --> 00:05:59,494
Scott: Let's say I crashed the car and it takes $2,000 worth of damage.

87
00:06:01,222 --> 00:06:13,372
Scott: I pay a thousand and the insurance pays a thousand totaling the two thousand, right if I took a $500 deductible and there were two thousand dollars worth of damage I would pay five hundred and the insurance company would pay fifteen hundred.

88
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:16,885
Rym: now bear in mind that we live in a what's called a No fault state.

89
00:06:17,508 --> 00:06:26,818
Rym: now if you live in a no-fault insurance state everything's weird because basically your insurance covers you and the other person's insurance covers them.

90
00:06:26,838 --> 00:06:33,477
Rym: and Whenever there's an accident if you have full insurance, it doesn't matter whose fault it was Whatever the insurance just all pays out no matter what

91
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:34,449
Scott: Mm-hmm

92
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:42,811
Rym: in Contented states which is the kind of state I prefer if you cause an accident You are responsible for all of the damages resulting.

93
00:06:43,373 --> 00:06:43,774
Scott: That's the way.

94
00:06:43,794 --> 00:06:45,199
Rym: you don't have insurance that covers it.

95
00:06:45,804 --> 00:06:46,679
Rym: You're kind of fucked.

96
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,289
Scott: Justice is the way it should be.

97
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,093
Scott: which is that way?

98
00:06:50,153 --> 00:06:50,736
Scott: the Rym just said.

99
00:06:50,817 --> 00:06:52,725
Rym: I think no fault Sure insurance should exist.

100
00:06:52,866 --> 00:06:54,573
Rym: as in if you want no fault insurance.

101
00:06:54,593 --> 00:06:56,239
Rym: You should be able to pay for it and have it.

102
00:06:56,762 --> 00:07:01,345
Scott: Oh, yeah, if you want to fix an a damage that someone else did to your car You're free to do so.

103
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:09,080
Scott: but at the same time if someone else damages my car I'm free to make them fix it because they did it if I can prove they did it.

104
00:07:09,321 --> 00:07:15,180
Rym: Yeah, the problem with no fault states is that they don't let you go after the people who cause accidents so easily.

105
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,664
Scott: Yeah, it sucks.

106
00:07:17,326 --> 00:07:21,419
Scott: So the thing here is that I'm financing the car which basically means I don't technically own it.

107
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:25,815
Scott: It's just collateral on this loan that I'm paying off to this bank.

108
00:07:26,116 --> 00:07:27,000
Rym: It's a lot like a mortgage.

109
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:37,633
Scott: Yeah, so they decide how much they could force me to get whatever insurance they want me to get and for some reason They're forcing me to get the $500 deductible instead of the 1,000.

110
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:40,037
Scott: I Don't know why.

111
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:41,911
Scott: That makes no sense.

112
00:07:41,972 --> 00:07:42,699
Scott: Why would they care?

113
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:49,844
Rym: but Yeah, if I were you I would have called the bank up and been like, hey, I don't have the bank's phone number I would have found it out.

114
00:07:50,045 --> 00:07:52,638
Scott: I could have found it out, but I think they were closed at that hour.

115
00:07:53,943 --> 00:07:59,939
Scott: The thing is is like If I get a thousand dollar deductible, it makes my insurance payments a lot less.

116
00:08:00,382 --> 00:08:02,639
Scott: So I'm wasting a lot less of my money on nothing.

117
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:07,234
Scott: So I kind of want it and I'm sure that after like I'm 25.

118
00:08:07,234 --> 00:08:07,796
Scott: I'll be fine.

119
00:08:08,077 --> 00:08:12,073
Rym: So whatever I mean, I just I hate the idea of having to have car insurance.

120
00:08:12,374 --> 00:08:16,853
Rym: if someone else causes an accident It's their dumbass fault and they should pay for the damages to me.

121
00:08:17,134 --> 00:08:21,660
Rym: And if they don't cause an accident Well, it's my dumbass fault and I should be forced to pay for it.

122
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:29,844
Scott: yeah, and if I think that I'm gonna cause an accident, I'm free to bet on insurance and gamble my money and Possibly pay out.

123
00:08:29,924 --> 00:08:38,734
Scott: if I do cause an accident also, and if I don't want insurance and I cause an accident That's my own damn fault for not getting insurance and betting wrong.

124
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,320
Scott: and now I should be forced to pay out.

125
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:48,555
Rym: Even worse if I had all the money that I've put into car insurance over the years It'd be enough to put a down payment on a new car or cover any kind of damage.

126
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:49,680
Rym: I might have caused to myself.

127
00:08:50,362 --> 00:08:53,454
Scott: Yeah, I know and think about if I had taken that money from the insurance.

128
00:08:53,795 --> 00:08:54,016
Scott: right.

129
00:08:54,297 --> 00:08:57,839
Scott: I'm putting in what $700 to insurance the next six months.

130
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,446
Scott: $700 in a savings account.

131
00:09:00,486 --> 00:09:02,854
Scott: we get three percent interest three percent.

132
00:09:02,874 --> 00:09:04,560
Rym: What kind of crap Bank are you going to?

133
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,892
Scott: That's what you get about as the average for a savings account these days.

134
00:09:08,053 --> 00:09:09,540
Rym: I get that on my checking account.

135
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:10,924
Scott: No, you don't.

136
00:09:11,386 --> 00:09:13,214
Rym: Well, I do on the account that has a dollar in it.

137
00:09:13,294 --> 00:09:14,640
Rym: I'm not one that has a dollar in it.

138
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,258
Rym: I haven't switched fully over to that bank yet.

139
00:09:17,183 --> 00:09:20,819
Scott: There's not much interest rates on normal savings accounts aren't so great these days.

140
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:23,553
Scott: Yeah, you know three and four percent range.

141
00:09:23,593 --> 00:09:24,779
Rym: Yeah, I go to a credit union man.

142
00:09:25,241 --> 00:09:31,845
Scott: it's not the set the normal savings account, but anyway, the point is is $700 a month.

143
00:09:31,985 --> 00:09:35,560
Scott: I'm gonna have the car for five years assuming that just stays the same.

144
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:40,443
Scott: 700 times 2 is 14 times 5.

145
00:09:40,443 --> 00:09:42,899
Scott: It's 22 thousand plus seven thousand dollars.

146
00:09:43,686 --> 00:09:44,575
Scott: four percent interest.

147
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,204
Rym: Congratulations that you're good at math.

148
00:09:47,585 --> 00:09:50,213
Scott: Yeah, the point is mad.

149
00:09:50,313 --> 00:09:56,338
Scott: money's yo enough to buy cars and Computers and gadgets and instead it goes to nothing.

150
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:58,239
Scott: It's crap.

151
00:09:58,882 --> 00:10:06,626
Rym: But at least you'll have the car tomorrow and we might be driving out to Rochester with a bunch of our friends for a weekend of Buying board games and playing them.

152
00:10:06,646 --> 00:10:11,819
Rym: Hooray playing multiple eight-player eight-way Bomberman slash Mario Kart's.

153
00:10:12,865 --> 00:10:15,059
Scott: We definitely need to buy some board games and play them.

154
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:23,208
Rym: Yeah I got to say the gaming stores where we live are not up to come up to par and I think I'm just gonna have a Little like gamegasm when I get back to Rochester.

155
00:10:23,228 --> 00:10:25,655
Scott: Yeah, I think I'll buy two or three games.

156
00:10:25,715 --> 00:10:27,059
Scott: Maybe if they have what I want.

157
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:36,400
Rym: So in the news for all of you who listened to yesterday's episode, we talked about the controversy surrounding Otakon's possible artists alley policy.

158
00:10:37,401 --> 00:10:47,340
Rym: Well, we're not the only ones talking about it and like we kind of mentioned There's a giant flaming shitstorm going on all over the Internet at least the anime Internet.

159
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:53,082
Rym: yeah, the Internet we care about the like the geekly anime whatever Internet and Otakon.

160
00:10:53,122 --> 00:10:57,977
Rym: today Jim Vowles the head of Otakon 2006 released an official statement regarding this.

161
00:10:58,018 --> 00:10:58,760
Rym: it's on the website.

162
00:10:59,428 --> 00:11:09,714
Rym: I'm not gonna read the whole thing But basically he says that Otakon is not not in capital letters Implementing nor is it ever seriously considered a total ban on fan arts.

163
00:11:10,176 --> 00:11:14,389
Rym: our initial posting on the subject Was clearly confused by some people blah blah blah and we apologize.

164
00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:15,873
Scott: All right, it was confusing.

165
00:11:15,893 --> 00:11:22,136
Scott: now, I Guess you could say it was confusing but Have you read it?

166
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,008
Rym: I mean I could see because it wall this.

167
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:40,145
Rym: the original announcement was posted under a thread entitled Official changes to artist alley policy and while it was posted by the head of the artists alley for Otakon There was language in the specific Clause they talked about.

168
00:11:40,446 --> 00:11:45,852
Rym: that does say something to the effect of the above will be reworded depending on blah blah blah Whatever the lawyers tell us.

169
00:11:47,022 --> 00:11:50,976
Rym: So, alright, if that had been it I would have been alright, obviously it was just a misunderstanding.

170
00:11:51,016 --> 00:11:51,940
Rym: They should have waited whatever.

171
00:11:52,805 --> 00:11:57,980
Rym: but The he says here that Otakon never seriously considered banning all fan art.

172
00:11:58,381 --> 00:12:07,494
Rym: Yet if you read all the posts by the head of the artist alley in the Otakon forum since the announcement she made She very much says that fan art is going to be banned.

173
00:12:07,514 --> 00:12:08,520
Rym: She doesn't use the word fan art.

174
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,539
Rym: She says you can't use that word, which I agree with because it's not a legal term.

175
00:12:12,202 --> 00:12:13,268
Rym: But she you can.

176
00:12:13,388 --> 00:12:19,513
Rym: there are many quotes for she very specifically outlines What is and is not allowed and what is not allowed is everything?

177
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:20,316
Rym: Yep.

178
00:12:20,979 --> 00:12:39,920
Scott: So obviously the there is a difference of opinion between the head of artists alley and the rest of Otakon and I think even though it looks like We're gonna turn out so that artists alley isn't ruined or anything Which is good not gonna argue that it looks like Otakon is gonna have to.

179
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:44,579
Scott: Just you know, they did a PR stumble for no reason.

180
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:55,373
Rym: Yeah I mean even if this policy went into effect and they were going to do it I can't believe that Otakon would not have expected an insane Possibly irrational backlash from anything like this.

181
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:56,980
Scott: to think that's the problem is Otakon.

182
00:12:57,521 --> 00:13:00,631
Scott: It doesn't look like this was a movement of Otakon itself.

183
00:13:00,712 --> 00:13:03,260
Scott: It looks like this was all the artists alley person.

184
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,024
Rym: Well, actually it was.

185
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:07,100
Rym: she admits to this in two separate posts in the forums.

186
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,884
Scott: See, that's the.

187
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:15,331
Scott: you can't have that you I mean, there's one thing we have absolutely no democracy And there's another and we have too much democracy, right?

188
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,860
Scott: Which is would be all the members decide how Otakon is wrong.

189
00:13:19,106 --> 00:13:26,460
Rym: I disagree because when I ran the anime club at RIT back in the day Basically every member of the executive board was in charge of a certain aspect of the club.

190
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:34,859
Rym: you know the treasurer the facilities coordinator whatever and Unless the board voted as a group to overrule someone which was a rare event.

191
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:43,529
Rym: a member of an eboard member was free to do whatever they wanted with their domain and Otakon seems to run the same way which in many ways works.

192
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:51,571
Rym: the head of the artists alley is fully in charge of the artist Alley, unless the rest of the board as far as I can gather here comes together and says alright No, we're overruling you.

193
00:13:51,591 --> 00:13:52,519
Rym: I agree.

194
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,463
Scott: but here's the problem.

195
00:13:54,025 --> 00:14:01,432
Scott: this artists alley person has stepped out of their role as head of artists alley and stepped into the Role of who should be the PR man,

196
00:14:01,894 --> 00:14:13,604
Rym: maybe I mean other than again This is her own forum And if she's running the artists alley I say she could use the forum to post of whatever she wants about the artists alley as long as she's willing to take care of the Possible PR consequences.

197
00:14:14,206 --> 00:14:17,374
Scott: Yeah, I just don't think that that's an intelligent way to run things.

198
00:14:17,494 --> 00:14:33,758
Scott: if you were so public that and you have So many people who you can upset or piss off or make blunders about You should either have a PR guy where everything goes through that person or You should you know Be real smart when you say things.

199
00:14:35,221 --> 00:14:40,300
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I guess if I were in charge of releasing like say Otakon was doing this policy.

200
00:14:40,482 --> 00:14:41,858
Rym: I was in charge of releasing it.

201
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:57,196
Rym: I would have gotten together with whoever was involved and come up with answers to every possible question I could think of and then made a big announcement about on the Otakon site and Along with all of the information like a fact and all the whole webpage dedicated to this change.

202
00:14:57,477 --> 00:15:01,438
Rym: that would diffuse the Immediate reactionary backlash that we've seen happen here.

203
00:15:02,242 --> 00:15:02,745
Scott: limit here.

204
00:15:02,805 --> 00:15:06,624
Scott: take an example of a company that does PR well take Microsoft right.

205
00:15:07,246 --> 00:15:17,490
Scott: anything that Microsoft ever says is either said by Bill Gates Steve Ballmer or an official press release an Official PR people I guess but they don't say much.

206
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,900
Scott: they just kind of say these things that have already been written.

207
00:15:20,062 --> 00:15:21,560
Scott: I listened to an interview with one guy today.

208
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:27,840
Scott: He just kept saying the same thing over and over again And if they asked him to say anything that wasn't already something he knew how to say.

209
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,500
Scott: He just dodged it entirely and said something generic.

210
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,580
Scott: You know and that's if you're you know.

211
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:44,540
Scott: That's the only way to be unless you're one of those completely wide-open companies where people see all of your internal communications Like you know something like Linux where the kernel mailing list is all the communication and it's wide open.

212
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,607
Rym: Yeah, you're not wanted right now.

213
00:15:46,707 --> 00:15:49,460
Rym: You could just subscribe to that and know exactly what's going on with the link.

214
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,350
Scott: I need to subscribe.

215
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,260
Scott: you can just go look at it.

216
00:15:51,361 --> 00:15:52,119
Scott: Oh, yeah, browse it.

217
00:15:52,180 --> 00:16:10,964
Scott: But yeah If you're not completely open so that no one has any Misunderstandings about what you're doing because they can see everything and it's completely transparent You need to be like all those real corporations that keep everything complete secret and make no official statements and no comments except for official PR and You know it.

218
00:16:11,627 --> 00:16:19,440
Scott: when you have such a loose kind of non Super strict thing like Otakon that is as big as Otakon sometimes these things happen.

219
00:16:20,122 --> 00:16:40,048
Rym: I mean at least I really think artist Ally's gonna be okay because at the end of the statement by Jim Vowels he says Until then then being when the policy is released officially We respectfully request that Responsible media and opinion shapers assist us in putting the rumors to rest and hold further questions on this matter Until after the actual final policy has been announced.

220
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:41,934
Scott: I just want to ask if he was here.

221
00:16:41,974 --> 00:16:42,636
Scott: I just asked him.

222
00:16:42,696 --> 00:16:47,359
Scott: so you're accusing your own artist Ally head of spreading rumors.

223
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:50,646
Scott: Is that what you're saying?

224
00:16:51,329 --> 00:16:52,053
Scott: and you probably say yeah, I

225
00:16:53,380 --> 00:17:12,005
Rym: Mean, I'm not sure I I mean, I don't know the staff I don't know what's actually going on behind the scenes but it from my experience with similar events and similar types of organizations, my best guess is that the the decision to announce it was made by the head of the artist Ally and it was probably a mistake.

226
00:17:12,567 --> 00:17:25,458
Rym: and now the president and everyone else are working damage control and Dealing with the consequences and they're probably rewriting the policy to be either be the same But then explain it or just rewriting it or scrapping it and I guess we'll just see what happens.

227
00:17:26,483 --> 00:17:29,940
Rym: Yeah, you can't really comment anymore until Otakon actually releases the final policy.

228
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:30,742
Scott: Mm-hmm.

229
00:17:30,963 --> 00:17:33,773
Scott: Yeah, but people got to work on their PR skills.

230
00:17:33,813 --> 00:17:34,917
Scott: No matter what the policy is.

231
00:17:34,937 --> 00:17:35,640
Scott: That's all I'm saying.

232
00:17:35,981 --> 00:17:40,080
Rym: Don't piss people off and remember that people are real easy to piss off on the internet.

233
00:17:40,411 --> 00:17:50,286
Rym: Yeah I mean Every time someone's name is posted anywhere like Fark or slashdot and there's someone that people don't like like a DRM guy or a spam Guy their email accounts done.

234
00:17:50,607 --> 00:17:55,560
Rym: just mobs of flaming flaming flaming flamers with trollish tendencies.

235
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:56,329
Rym: Just attack them.

236
00:17:56,936 --> 00:17:58,957
Scott: Yeah Don't be those guys.

237
00:18:00,752 --> 00:18:04,027
Scott: So Speaking of PR and making announcements.

238
00:18:04,328 --> 00:18:06,213
Scott: I just mentioned a little minute ago Bill Gates.

239
00:18:06,554 --> 00:18:08,340
Scott: Well, he actually did make an announcement today.

240
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,239
Scott: you said Where's the quote?

241
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,199
Scott: The ability to really withhold information no longer exists.

242
00:18:15,822 --> 00:18:23,419
Scott: You may be able to take a very visible website and say that something shouldn't be there But if there is a desire by the population to know something it is going to get out.

243
00:18:23,861 --> 00:18:29,200
Scott: He's basically saying that governments trying to censor the internet are dumb and they they're not going to succeed at all.

244
00:18:29,606 --> 00:18:30,359
Scott: They have no chance.

245
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:36,440
Rym: That's part of why I think Google seems to be cooperating with China a lot in that they'll block whatever China requests.

246
00:18:37,062 --> 00:18:38,927
Rym: But I'll note that all over the internet.

247
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:43,700
Rym: it's obvious how trivial it is to even using Google get around those blocks anyway.

248
00:18:44,244 --> 00:18:45,029
Scott: Yeah, but look at this.

249
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:53,076
Scott: the way I see this is Goo, everyone's looking at Google now saying they're all evil with China, right and they actually the stock dropped a whole bunch.

250
00:18:53,698 --> 00:19:04,960
Scott: now Microsoft which is a competitor somewhat to Google is Taking the other side against Google the side that's supposedly good, you know by Bill Gates saying this maybe he'll get you know.

251
00:19:05,882 --> 00:19:08,359
Rym: Yeah, this is definitely a good PR move on the side of Microsoft.

252
00:19:09,622 --> 00:19:14,386
Scott: Yeah, gonna little boost a little Microsoft stock, you know if it goes down when you you know Try to censor things.

253
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:16,660
Scott: It'll go up when you say you can't censor things.

254
00:19:16,901 --> 00:19:18,104
Scott: It makes sense though.

255
00:19:18,165 --> 00:19:25,447
Rym: Honestly the stock drop from what I've been reading has a lot more to do with the fact that the stock Skyrocketed and was worth more than it should have been worth.

256
00:19:25,527 --> 00:19:25,868
Rym: Anyway.

257
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:37,474
Rym: Yeah, it was and that the mic Google has twice in recent memory as in within the last month or so Ignored or Congress about various issues.

258
00:19:37,495 --> 00:19:40,599
Scott: Mm-hmm Yeah, that'll always make your stock go down even if you're right.

259
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:47,220
Scott: But as soon as it's a good bet to do that sort of thing if you think you're gonna win Because when you beat Congress your stock goes crazy through the roof.

260
00:19:48,641 --> 00:19:51,429
Scott: I think Google's a stock drop was pretty well deserved.

261
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:57,083
Scott: after the little Google video sort of fiasco thing What the hell is the?

262
00:19:57,143 --> 00:19:59,450
Rym: what archive of American television?

263
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,437
Scott: No, no, no, but yeah, we that is terrible.

264
00:20:02,498 --> 00:20:03,380
Rym: What the hell is that?

265
00:20:03,521 --> 00:20:14,005
Scott: yeah, no, but the point is is that Google video came out in recent weeks with the ability to buy episodes of shows on Like NBC shows.

266
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:24,600
Scott: I think yeah, but it's real in my way kind of annoying Yeah, and basically what happened is at first they didn't do it too Well, they tried to do too much of a simplified Google design.

267
00:20:24,821 --> 00:20:31,064
Scott: You tried to do too much with it so they weren't selling any shows so they changed it to what it is now But they're still not really selling.

268
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:41,077
Scott: like iTunes is so already the networks that were selling their shows on Google video We're like screw that we're gonna sell it on our own website and in other places too because Google video really

269
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,092
Rym: you know What that's fine in that I wouldn't buy these shows from anyone anywhere.

270
00:20:45,433 --> 00:20:47,220
Scott: Yeah, me either because they're terrible shows.

271
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:55,430
Scott: I think that's something else people have to realize is that the shows that were being sold on iTunes Were shows that internet people actually wanted to buy.

272
00:20:55,611 --> 00:21:02,053
Scott: well the shows that look like they're being sold on Google video Were shows that like people who don't even know how to use a computer.

273
00:21:02,073 --> 00:21:03,820
Scott: You know are gonna buy.

274
00:21:04,661 --> 00:21:11,870
Rym: So every now and then if I'm in a laundromat and the TV will be on I can't turn it off and I see what's On American TV these days, and it's painful.

275
00:21:12,412 --> 00:21:13,576
Rym: It's painful to watch.

276
00:21:13,616 --> 00:21:14,419
Rym: I can't deal with it.

277
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:21,908
Scott: Yeah, but the point is is that even Google has admitted that Google video really hasn't lived up in terms of its You know selling of legitimate content.

278
00:21:21,928 --> 00:21:24,880
Rym: Yeah, but in terms of finding videos of explosions or cute kittens?

279
00:21:25,261 --> 00:21:29,480
Scott: Yeah in terms of finding all the funny videos on the internet Google video is the the shit.

280
00:21:29,661 --> 00:21:30,082
Rym: It's all though.

281
00:21:30,143 --> 00:21:32,815
Rym: now there seems to be this trend of a video getting popular.

282
00:21:32,855 --> 00:21:33,960
Rym: That is in no way funny.

283
00:21:34,441 --> 00:21:36,507
Rym: Yeah, what was the one we saw in popular recently?

284
00:21:36,608 --> 00:21:42,285
Rym: was it was a Google video of a kid sitting there like eating some pudding Or yogurt or something?

285
00:21:42,365 --> 00:21:44,552
Rym: it was something slimy and that was it.

286
00:21:44,752 --> 00:21:47,513
Rym: it was like 20 seconds long because you know what it's the people Who?

287
00:21:48,521 --> 00:21:50,259
Scott: Haven't seen all this shit on the internet?

288
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,309
Scott: Imagine if you were brand new to the internet.

289
00:21:53,329 --> 00:21:56,640
Scott: you were an internet virgin and someone brought you up and showed you that video.

290
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,303
Rym: Oh my god.

291
00:21:57,343 --> 00:21:58,891
Rym: It's a kid eating pudding on the internet.

292
00:21:58,931 --> 00:22:00,740
Rym: What the hell all those face.

293
00:22:01,601 --> 00:22:01,782
Scott: It's.

294
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:04,219
Scott: you know the never-ending September of Google video.

295
00:22:05,082 --> 00:22:05,343
Rym: You know.

296
00:22:05,423 --> 00:22:11,280
Rym: if any of you out there don't know what the never-ending September is just don't say anything because it'll make me feel old.

297
00:22:11,661 --> 00:22:13,729
Scott: Go to the Wikipedia for never-ending September.

298
00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:14,874
Scott: I'm sure there has to be one.

299
00:22:15,255 --> 00:22:15,958
Rym: I'm sure there is.

300
00:22:16,018 --> 00:22:17,769
Rym: I haven't looked But yeah, that'll.

301
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,140
Scott: that'll tell you what we're talking about.

302
00:22:25,828 --> 00:22:27,630
Scott: So we like hockey ice hockey.

303
00:22:28,072 --> 00:22:28,977
Scott: You know who you are.

304
00:22:33,371 --> 00:22:35,579
Scott: There's a goalie from I think Finland.

305
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:38,469
Scott: his name is Kari Lettenen.

306
00:22:39,854 --> 00:22:44,957
Scott: I'm pretty sure that's the correct pronunciation And I don't know how good a goalie is.

307
00:22:45,017 --> 00:22:49,210
Scott: I think must be pretty good being in the NHL and playing for the Atlanta Thrashers.

308
00:22:50,351 --> 00:22:52,597
Scott: But you know goalies always have fancy helmets right?

309
00:22:53,038 --> 00:23:00,660
Scott: you know with a bumblebee or a tiger on them or something else cool You know There's a lot of space to work with.

310
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,108
Scott: so they nest they like to paint something nice.

311
00:23:03,492 --> 00:23:11,436
Scott: well Kari Lettenen is apparently a huge gamer like Hardcore and on his helmet.

312
00:23:12,018 --> 00:23:15,490
Scott: He has two characters from Final Fantasy 10, Yuna and Riku.

313
00:23:16,234 --> 00:23:20,733
Scott: Yeah, so if that's not cool I Don't know what to say.

314
00:23:21,094 --> 00:23:25,510
Rym: the link has a nice close-up shot of him wearing this helmet, and it's very obvious.

315
00:23:26,211 --> 00:23:26,873
Rym: There's no way.

316
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:27,776
Rym: This is something else.

317
00:23:28,379 --> 00:23:28,559
Scott: No.

318
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:30,727
Scott: No don't it is not even a question.

319
00:23:30,988 --> 00:23:32,539
Scott: if you ask him He'll probably just be like yep.

320
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:33,124
Scott: That's it.

321
00:23:33,184 --> 00:23:33,507
Scott: That's it.

322
00:23:36,011 --> 00:23:52,748
Rym: So a company called Floran X active in Israel has supposedly come up with a way to Use electricity and a chemical to change the composition of the outer layer of the enamel of your teeth to make them highly resistant to bacteria and acid.

323
00:23:53,734 --> 00:23:54,341
Scott: So wait wait wait.

324
00:23:54,401 --> 00:23:59,304
Rym: you're basically Electroplating your teeth kind of what they do now this I haven't.

325
00:23:59,364 --> 00:24:00,910
Rym: there's no scientific journal on this.

326
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:06,114
Rym: This is just a kind of a press release thing, but it looks semi legitimate as Far as I know.

327
00:24:06,174 --> 00:24:08,168
Rym: we'll see we'll see, but I think this is legit.

328
00:24:08,931 --> 00:24:26,750
Rym: Basically they use a gel and an electronic electric signal and what they'll do is it'll carry of Fluoride ions into your enamel which will replace the hydroxide ions that are currently there Which is kind of what fluoride does to a smaller scale when you drink fluoridated water.

329
00:24:26,831 --> 00:24:29,069
Scott: So they're basically forcing the fluoride into the teeth.

330
00:24:29,851 --> 00:24:38,348
Rym: basically yeah changes the composition of the mineral layer of that surrounds the teeth and makes them almost invulnerable and You get the treatment every five years.

331
00:24:38,629 --> 00:24:42,420
Rym: you're pretty much immune to cavities except for the ones that are like under your gums.

332
00:24:43,383 --> 00:24:46,428
Scott: so You're electroplating your teeth with fluoride.

333
00:24:46,869 --> 00:24:49,195
Rym: basically they don't have much more about it.

334
00:24:49,456 --> 00:24:50,700
Rym: I'm curious to see how this develops.

335
00:24:51,642 --> 00:24:59,183
Scott: You know if it was if it worked, and it didn't have any nasty side effects like I don't know tooth pain or Tooth pain.

336
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:04,880
Scott: I have adamantium teeth or perhaps tooth pain, then I would go for it doesn't look like it hurts.

337
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,078
Rym: They kind of done it to some people.

338
00:25:06,401 --> 00:25:10,096
Rym: Really apparently people have been trying to come up with a way to do this exact thing.

339
00:25:10,417 --> 00:25:13,511
Scott: for decades They never thought of electroplating teeth with fluoride.

340
00:25:13,792 --> 00:25:14,516
Rym: They've always thought of it.

341
00:25:14,536 --> 00:25:15,440
Rym: There was never able to do it.

342
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,626
Rym: It's not really electroplating.

343
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:18,133
Scott: It's the same principle.

344
00:25:18,173 --> 00:25:19,520
Scott: I think it sounds like the same principle.

345
00:25:20,906 --> 00:25:23,839
Rym: I mean they didn't give us any very good technical details on it.

346
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:30,339
Rym: But the militaries of the world have been contending with the issue of troops getting terrible teeth for forever.

347
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,374
Scott: well Because you lose you can't really brush your teeth in the desert.

348
00:25:33,776 --> 00:25:34,520
Scott: You know it sucks.

349
00:25:35,101 --> 00:25:42,667
Rym: Not only that but soldiers tend to be nervous so their mouth gets dry and when they're out when your mouth is dry That's prime breeding ground for bacteria.

350
00:25:42,687 --> 00:25:45,620
Scott: Yeah, saliva is the is the cleaner of teeth more than anything.

351
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,650
Rym: I mean that's what causes a meth mouth and people who use crystal meth.

352
00:25:48,811 --> 00:25:51,380
Rym: they they'd get dehydrated and then their teeth just rot.

353
00:25:51,761 --> 00:25:57,420
Rym: Mm-hmm and also a lot of our troops recently are in the desert, but that's dry air which doesn't contribute very well.

354
00:25:57,821 --> 00:26:03,380
Rym: No, so there's been a lot of strides in research and tooth care in the military, and this is another one.

355
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,870
Rym: It looks like the Israeli military is gonna jump all over this once.

356
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:06,332
Rym: It's proven.

357
00:26:06,714 --> 00:26:06,895
Scott: Well.

358
00:26:07,096 --> 00:26:15,485
Scott: You know what if it works out I'll have to do a scientific study of biting power in People who had you in biting.

359
00:26:15,546 --> 00:26:18,977
Scott: what the hell if it gives me more ability to bite.

360
00:26:19,238 --> 00:26:22,100
Rym: It's all good I'm not much ability to bite you actually have.

361
00:26:23,401 --> 00:26:27,540
Scott: What's the purpose of teeth to chew and what is chewing?

362
00:26:28,242 --> 00:26:31,291
Rym: Chewing is not simply a form of biting repeatedly.

363
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:36,861
Scott: chewing is a rapid and repeated biting Hence.

364
00:26:37,323 --> 00:26:50,200
Rym: anything that improves my functionality of my teeth without you know doing any bad to me is Okay, see I'd be with you if you were say eating meat off of a cow, but you're eating meat off of a plate.

365
00:26:51,644 --> 00:26:53,357
Scott: You know sometimes that meats hard to chew.

366
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,318
Scott: You chew it and chew it and chew it and you make meat gum also.

367
00:26:57,439 --> 00:26:58,584
Rym: now I think I learned the secret.

368
00:26:58,665 --> 00:26:59,770
Scott: you think you learn the secret.

369
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:02,060
Scott: have you actually performed the secret?

370
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,895
Rym: You realize that I cook meats other than stir-fry and my non stir-fry meats are quite delectable.

371
00:27:06,915 --> 00:27:08,982
Scott: my non stir-fry meats are also Delectable.

372
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,165
Rym: you eat almost no meats.

373
00:27:10,526 --> 00:27:11,429
Scott: I eat plenty of meats.

374
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:15,260
Rym: Yeah, you won't eat any pork derivative whatsoever bacon.

375
00:27:15,602 --> 00:27:16,911
Rym: You won't eat other than bacon.

376
00:27:16,931 --> 00:27:17,515
Rym: You'll eat bacon.

377
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:21,772
Rym: You won't eat any of my Sausages or cabasas, I don't like sausages.

378
00:27:22,335 --> 00:27:23,460
Rym: you ever had a beef cabasa.

379
00:27:24,721 --> 00:27:26,389
Rym: No, oh, well, how do you know you don't like it?

380
00:27:26,409 --> 00:27:30,522
Scott: I just don't like most wiener meats This one.

381
00:27:30,542 --> 00:27:32,148
Rym: How do you know it doesn't taste completely different?

382
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:34,096
Scott: because I know you don't know.

383
00:27:34,116 --> 00:27:35,139
Scott: I do know you know.

384
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,186
Rym: Yeah, I never had it.

385
00:27:36,226 --> 00:27:37,353
Rym: You don't know I know.

386
00:27:37,755 --> 00:27:38,500
Rym: provide me some evidence.

387
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:44,778
Scott: It's not a provable thing so I guess science can't go there.

388
00:27:45,543 --> 00:27:47,339
Scott: There's no way to prove it or disprove it.

389
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:53,140
Rym: so anyway Today we thought we'd talk about the toys of our youth.

390
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:58,214
Scott: Yeah Our shows of our youth is pretty popular and we stopped at what.

391
00:27:58,254 --> 00:27:58,676
Scott: when did we?

392
00:27:58,756 --> 00:27:59,920
Scott: what show did we stop on?

393
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,123
Rym: I don't remember.

394
00:28:01,585 --> 00:28:12,043
Scott: we did the shows of like our early youth like the Sesame Street's right and After that we watched more shows, but all those shows are really just toys Animated.

395
00:28:12,605 --> 00:28:21,800
Scott: so I figured since that was a good episode that people seem to like we would just do toys of our youth Which is sort of also the sequel to shows of our youth because it covers the same things like I don't know.

396
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:31,420
Rym: transformers yeah mask Voltron Thundercats Thundercats Ninja Turtles Ninja Turtles a lot of Ninja Turtles GI Joe.

397
00:28:32,466 --> 00:28:36,514
Rym: I didn't have so many Joes at all, but I'm just saying what I had though at army men.

398
00:28:36,534 --> 00:28:40,153
Scott: I had a little green army I had so many army men matchbox cars.

399
00:28:40,616 --> 00:28:41,018
Rym: Oh, I was.

400
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:51,271
Scott: What is also see what's the difference between matchbox cars and Hot Wheels, I don't know But I didn't.

401
00:28:51,332 --> 00:28:52,059
Rym: so I have no idea.

402
00:28:52,261 --> 00:28:55,414
Scott: I think one is made by Mattel and another one is made by some other company.

403
00:28:55,535 --> 00:28:56,780
Rym: all I know is I think I had both.

404
00:28:56,921 --> 00:28:57,946
Rym: I just had a whole pile of them.

405
00:28:58,208 --> 00:29:00,540
Scott: Yeah, I just I bought what cars look cool.

406
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,680
Scott: I didn't care if they were matchbox or Hot Wheels or Oh micro machines.

407
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:09,911
Rym: Yeah, I was about to say cuz matchbox cars were awesome But there wasn't so much non car stuff to go with it.

408
00:29:09,951 --> 00:29:12,499
Scott: well because the micro machines all what they would do.

409
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,188
Scott: Know the Hot Wheels and matchbox cars.

410
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:18,280
Scott: what they would do is you get these ramps and you would always send them down the ramp.

411
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:23,235
Scott: Yeah Or you'd push them around a track or there would be a thing with a spinny rubber bit that would.

412
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:24,459
Scott: that would shoot them out.

413
00:29:25,601 --> 00:29:27,268
Scott: Yeah, we make them do a jump.

414
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:28,694
Scott: Oh the car wash.

415
00:29:28,714 --> 00:29:29,818
Scott: There's a car wash for them.

416
00:29:29,939 --> 00:29:30,281
Rym: Yeah I had.

417
00:29:30,321 --> 00:29:35,760
Scott: that didn't actually work, so I didn't work so well But that was a popular toy that I knew people who had it, but I had it and it was awesome.

418
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:42,459
Scott: Anyway, yeah, but Micro machines had like cities you could drive around and it had.

419
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,319
Rym: Remember waffle blocks?

420
00:29:47,121 --> 00:29:49,869
Rym: No, oh wow waffle blocks were these big.

421
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:59,760
Rym: they were about a foot by a foot and they were just big flat Squarish objects and they pieced together and you could make large structures with them.

422
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:08,978
Rym: No, like large enough to make a boat and then sit in it or make a giant cube and put yourself in it Stairway higher than your mom would like you to and then fall off of it.

423
00:30:09,461 --> 00:30:11,227
Scott: Well, we usually did is at my friend's house.

424
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,575
Scott: He had these basically what were cardboard bricks.

425
00:30:14,117 --> 00:30:14,960
Scott: It was just a cardboard.

426
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:16,427
Rym: Oh, yeah, we had those two.

427
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:19,180
Scott: It was just a cardboard rectangle basically that folded.

428
00:30:19,422 --> 00:30:26,652
Scott: It was a these a cardboard that folded into a rectangular Thing and it the outside of it was painted to look like a brick.

429
00:30:27,014 --> 00:30:29,388
Scott: and you said a whole mess of them because they were Cheap as crap.

430
00:30:29,509 --> 00:30:30,500
Rym: We throw them at each other.

431
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,450
Scott: Yeah, you just we just made stuff out of them.

432
00:30:32,551 --> 00:30:44,278
Scott: and then you usually took one of those little Fisher price cars that was powered by your feet, you know, not the power wheels which are cool But you know the little indoor ones had like the yellow roof with the little.

433
00:30:44,298 --> 00:30:45,505
Rym: oh, yeah Yeah, I had one of those.

434
00:30:45,566 --> 00:30:46,917
Rym: it was red with a yellow roof.

435
00:30:47,139 --> 00:30:50,234
Rym: Yeah It's like a little funny car steering wheel didn't even do anything.

436
00:30:50,254 --> 00:30:51,240
Scott: steering wheel doesn't do anything.

437
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,120
Scott: You just you Flintstones it, you know.

438
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,680
Scott: You just push your legs in the ground to go and you drive that right through the brick wall.

439
00:30:56,841 --> 00:30:58,589
Scott: And that was the like the funnest thing in the world.

440
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,740
Rym: I always put my brother in it and push him through the brick wall.

441
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,483
Scott: Yeah, that was good.

442
00:31:01,543 --> 00:31:03,331
Scott: pushing pushing help to make it go fast.

443
00:31:03,431 --> 00:31:06,845
Rym: Well the box where I guess a step more sophisticated I'll look online.

444
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:07,307
Rym: You'll see him.

445
00:31:07,548 --> 00:31:09,700
Rym: But basically there were these mini waffle blocks.

446
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:20,842
Rym: I don't know if they were called something else But the road pieces that came with them because they little road pieces you can make a lot of houses and stuff out of them Were exactly two lanes for micro machines Really?

447
00:31:20,982 --> 00:31:28,458
Rym: Thus I would always build like the micro machine city with all my micro gene sets and Then I'd build like the suburbs with these things.

448
00:31:29,401 --> 00:31:30,580
Rym: It was high quality.

449
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:42,727
Scott: Yeah, that was always a problem when like toy you wanted toys to play with each other, but they were incompatible somehow like Thundercats and Lego man really didn't go together.

450
00:31:42,788 --> 00:31:43,770
Scott: Well because Lion.

451
00:31:43,891 --> 00:31:47,060
Scott: Oh, it was like really tall and the Lego men were kind of small.

452
00:31:47,601 --> 00:31:50,749
Rym: Yep, but then you get those crazy by chance.

453
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:55,162
Rym: a toy works better with a different thing than you'd expect and that's when when fun Happens.

454
00:31:55,243 --> 00:31:58,140
Rym: Yeah, my best story involving that is alright.

455
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,445
Rym: I had masked toys.

456
00:31:59,846 --> 00:32:01,432
Rym: and say what you will about the show.

457
00:32:01,774 --> 00:32:03,480
Rym: masked toys were frickin awesome.

458
00:32:03,782 --> 00:32:05,779
Rym: They were much higher quality than transformers.

459
00:32:06,141 --> 00:32:12,160
Rym: They were just cars that transformed into things usually into bigger flying things with missiles coming out of them.

460
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,262
Scott: Yeah, not into robots with heads But no.

461
00:32:15,206 --> 00:32:18,500
Rym: and they also had little guys that sat in him and it could stay in him while they transform.

462
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:23,480
Rym: But the guys were like four inches tall five inches tall and they had masks that you could put on them.

463
00:32:23,863 --> 00:32:30,840
Rym: yeah, it's called mask and The coolest thing was that the technodrome from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles set.

464
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,179
Rym: The turtles didn't really fit in it.

465
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,000
Rym: I had the technodrome and I had all the turtles toys and the turtles were just really kind of big and ungainly in there.

466
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:38,884
Rym: you Couldn't even play with it.

467
00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:40,031
Scott: Yeah, I had the.

468
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:41,520
Scott: I think we already talked about this.

469
00:32:41,601 --> 00:32:43,779
Scott: I had the Thundercats layer the cats layer.

470
00:32:43,967 --> 00:32:44,461
Rym: Yeah I didn't know.

471
00:32:44,481 --> 00:32:52,110
Scott: Thundercats guys only kind of fit in it like there was certain parts where they were meant to fit in But you couldn't really move them around in there and play with them.

472
00:32:52,712 --> 00:32:54,800
Rym: See the mask bases were really high quality.

473
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,508
Rym: They were huge in there and you could.

474
00:32:56,528 --> 00:32:59,020
Rym: they had little chairs and stuff made all just like hanging out.

475
00:32:59,881 --> 00:33:00,763
Rym: But the technodrome.

476
00:33:01,084 --> 00:33:06,940
Rym: I basically turned that into my masked men's Death Star and they'd roam around wreaking havoc upon the Lego man.

477
00:33:07,542 --> 00:33:08,626
Scott: I never had the technodrome.

478
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:10,152
Scott: I don't know anyone at the technodrome.

479
00:33:10,192 --> 00:33:13,485
Rym: technodrome was probably one of the highest quality little toys I remember from that era.

480
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:16,540
Scott: I know you had the Ninja Turtles sewer, which was excellent.

481
00:33:16,781 --> 00:33:17,504
Rym: I had that as well.

482
00:33:17,524 --> 00:33:18,589
Rym: It had the spiky ball.

483
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:19,894
Rym: Yeah drop into the pipe.

484
00:33:20,135 --> 00:33:21,120
Scott: That was exactly the toy.

485
00:33:21,621 --> 00:33:28,500
Rym: My problem was I had one foot soldier and then four turtles and Casey Jones and April and then splinter and the shredder.

486
00:33:28,681 --> 00:33:33,680
Scott: Yeah, my brother was really the one who got all the Ninja Turtles toys But it was cool because I was still playing with them or whatever.

487
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,564
Rym: Actually, I think they're.

488
00:33:34,604 --> 00:33:35,267
Rym: technically they were.

489
00:33:35,307 --> 00:33:38,140
Rym: my mask was mine and the turtles were my brothers.

490
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,007
Rym: Yeah, we both played with them both all the time.

491
00:33:40,027 --> 00:33:47,495
Scott: Oh, yeah, it was just whatever but I think the kid down the street I'd like three foot soldiers and we had one or two and another kid had a couple.

492
00:33:47,555 --> 00:33:48,539
Scott: so we ended up with enough.

493
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:54,700
Scott: But it wasn't like, you know, if I was gonna play Star Wars, I would need at least 50 stormtroopers or something.

494
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,968
Rym: You know has bugged me though about the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

495
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:03,932
Rym: the turtles themselves were high quality and so were their sets Except for the turtles on motorcycles thing, which I don't get.

496
00:34:03,952 --> 00:34:07,029
Rym: this trend of take a character and put them on a motorcycle I don't get it either.

497
00:34:07,069 --> 00:34:08,761
Rym: We saw a Darth Vader one I mean.

498
00:34:08,962 --> 00:34:11,871
Scott: when you looked at the Ninja Turtles figures we had we have one of every guy.

499
00:34:11,931 --> 00:34:18,935
Scott: normally we had splinter Casey Jones April shredder bebop rocksteady right all the normal characters.

500
00:34:19,536 --> 00:34:24,230
Scott: then we had like Donatello the fireman and I didn't have any of those.

501
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:30,485
Scott: we had Michelangelo like the skateboarder and we had All kinds of crazy stuff.

502
00:34:30,606 --> 00:34:33,760
Scott: actually Donatello the fireman was one of the best quality toys.

503
00:34:34,583 --> 00:34:37,860
Rym: But what always pissed me off about the turtles was that they were high quality.

504
00:34:38,704 --> 00:34:41,760
Rym: How come the weapons that came with them were these flimsy?

505
00:34:42,261 --> 00:34:46,092
Rym: Tiny brown plastic unpainted little pieces of crap.

506
00:34:46,614 --> 00:34:47,096
Scott: I agree.

507
00:34:47,237 --> 00:34:48,159
Scott: They always got lost.

508
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:50,300
Rym: I lost all of them within about a minute.

509
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:59,700
Scott: There is nothing worse than a toy which a does not stand up on its own in any position Ah, and B cannot hold its weapons properly.

510
00:35:00,235 --> 00:35:04,340
Rym: I mean I'm okay with like a big thing that shoots a tiny little missile that you'll lose.

511
00:35:04,822 --> 00:35:07,173
Rym: Cuz kids are smart and they won't shoot them, you know behind the couch.

512
00:35:07,434 --> 00:35:07,916
Rym: We know better.

513
00:35:07,936 --> 00:35:22,824
Rym: Ah Yeah, yeah, but if there's nowhere to actually put that little missile and it just sits there hmm The worst that also is when you want to like share weapons between toys Like never worked.

514
00:35:23,065 --> 00:35:30,092
Scott: a he-man figure is about the same size as a Ninja Turtles figure which is about the same size Is I don't know Robocop Thundercat.

515
00:35:30,654 --> 00:35:33,939
Rym: I had all the Robocop toys Don't you flip their backs and they have caps in them?

516
00:35:34,441 --> 00:35:38,039
Scott: I guess anyway, you know all action figures are about the same size.

517
00:35:38,662 --> 00:35:46,629
Scott: but if you could get you know Leonardo to hold the sword of omens or if you could get He-man to hold it like Donatello's stick.

518
00:35:46,649 --> 00:35:54,110
Rym: I Didn't know you were into that sort of thing.

519
00:35:55,013 --> 00:35:56,746
Scott: But if you can get that to happen the winner is you.

520
00:35:57,391 --> 00:36:00,370
Rym: No, I think the winner is a Donatello.

521
00:36:02,152 --> 00:36:10,575
Rym: Maybe You Know actually for in terms of guys that held guns The Robocop toys.

522
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:19,190
Rym: if you ignore the gimmick of the fact that you put a roll of caps in their back And then you could flick it and they would shoot meaning they'd make a lot of noise and piss your parents off.

523
00:36:20,091 --> 00:36:20,694
Rym: God, my parents.

524
00:36:20,734 --> 00:36:21,236
Rym: I hated me.

525
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:22,662
Rym: I think that was.

526
00:36:22,682 --> 00:36:24,550
Scott: the purpose of most toys is to piss parents.

527
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:30,309
Scott: It was like hey kids This your parents off in the store to make them buy you this and then piss them off with it and make them regret it.

528
00:36:30,831 --> 00:36:37,190
Rym: But the characters came with their little guns were high-quality and well done and they fit into their hands and didn't fall out.

529
00:36:40,012 --> 00:36:48,272
Rym: And also my parents were smart this time as was in the Ninja Turtles and they bought me a million of the bad guys and Then I had Robocop and he killed them all Really?

530
00:36:48,352 --> 00:36:49,718
Scott: I figured I would make Robocop lose.

531
00:36:49,738 --> 00:36:50,842
Scott: I don't know.

532
00:36:50,983 --> 00:36:51,726
Rym: I liked Robocop.

533
00:36:51,766 --> 00:36:52,710
Rym: I looked up to him as a kid.

534
00:36:53,232 --> 00:36:55,079
Scott: Oh, you should have gotten the Terminator to kick his ass.

535
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,732
Rym: I didn't have any Terminator - I didn't have any Terminators either You know.

536
00:36:59,752 --> 00:37:05,309
Rym: thinking back though, I can't recall many of the scenarios I put my various action guys into.

537
00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:08,110
Scott: I Can recall a few of the scenario?

538
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:17,708
Rym: I just I remember most of what I was doing as just like I'd have two characters and I like I got hold Donatello with this thing and then he hit another guy with it and then I'd like make that guy fall down.

539
00:37:20,215 --> 00:37:21,147
Scott: I would usually try.

540
00:37:21,188 --> 00:37:29,313
Scott: you know how nerds will sometimes argue like aha if there was a fight between a Hypothetical battle between this fictional thing and this fictional thing What would happen?

541
00:37:29,393 --> 00:37:29,635
Scott: right?

542
00:37:30,298 --> 00:37:45,037
Scott: and I would be all I would try to like figure it out Like I'd be like, all right He tries to punch him but he can do this and then he would try to hit him with the sword up But he can do this and then he tries to And then it eventually somewhat I'd be like up Oh, that is the winner.

543
00:37:45,177 --> 00:37:54,790
Rym: and then I would make like a little tournament or something I always did like the good guys Ganging up to get the bad guys Especially with the mask figures because the good guys and the bad guys each had their own base.

544
00:37:55,172 --> 00:38:01,268
Rym: I gave the bad guys the technodrome and the good guys had like Boulder Mountain and there always be infighting in the good guys.

545
00:38:01,288 --> 00:38:13,309
Rym: and Then what like one guy would always like try to be the hero and get killed and then everyone else would be like, oh And then they'd fight back and mmm It took some priming but it's all starting to come back to me.

546
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:16,500
Scott: You played with more toys and just action figures though, right?

547
00:38:17,001 --> 00:38:19,250
Scott: I think we had slot cars are always cool.

548
00:38:19,932 --> 00:38:24,750
Rym: Oh, I had two different sets of slot cars and actually I had model trains like old-school model.

549
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,789
Scott: I had one model train.

550
00:38:26,332 --> 00:38:27,155
Scott: I actually had two.

551
00:38:27,275 --> 00:38:31,270
Scott: one of them was all fancy like a bullet train with lights and shit and that was a piece of crap.

552
00:38:31,352 --> 00:38:31,726
Scott: It didn't work.

553
00:38:32,172 --> 00:38:41,714
Scott: Then I got a real train where he screwed tracks down to a piece of wood a giant oval Yeah, and then put the train on it with the fake smoke and everything and I only used it a few times But I had it.

554
00:38:42,178 --> 00:38:50,349
Rym: Well I had from when my parents were kids I had this old like three-track electric train set that was old and metal and heavy and difficult to use.

555
00:38:51,571 --> 00:38:52,958
Scott: Mine weren't that difficult to use

556
00:38:53,179 --> 00:39:05,527
Rym: but the things I had more fun with I don't know what they're called at all but they were Really really really realistic trains and these little snap together tracks and a million things to go with him and they weren't powered at all Like you had to do everything manually with your hands

557
00:39:06,091 --> 00:39:06,372
Scott: Mm-hmm.

558
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:08,319
Rym: I don't remember any more than that.

559
00:39:08,399 --> 00:39:11,230
Rym: I don't know what they were called or anything, but they were awesome.

560
00:39:12,091 --> 00:39:22,658
Scott: Yeah, there were quite a few toys that I remember having and not remembering exactly what they were Like not so much action figures, but other things Like what was that thing?

561
00:39:22,678 --> 00:39:24,570
Scott: That was like a ball with a disc.

562
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:27,429
Scott: It looked like the planet Saturn but you would stand on it.

563
00:39:27,871 --> 00:39:30,219
Scott: Oh and then you jump and then you jumped and you held.

564
00:39:30,259 --> 00:39:34,769
Scott: you grabbed the ball with your feet and you just keep jumping And then you could do stuff.

565
00:39:34,951 --> 00:39:43,710
Rym: I remember seeing that when it first appeared on TV and thinking it was the stupidest thing ever I didn't understand the point of it But my friend had and I remember trying like that jump rope thing where you put it around one leg.

566
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:44,976
Scott: Oh, that's skip it skip.

567
00:39:45,016 --> 00:39:45,719
Scott: It's actually fun.

568
00:39:46,101 --> 00:39:46,604
Rym: No skip.

569
00:39:46,644 --> 00:39:47,267
Rym: It's not fun.

570
00:39:47,287 --> 00:39:47,950
Scott: Skip it is fun.

571
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,556
Scott: The thing about skip it though that sucks.

572
00:39:50,078 --> 00:39:52,990
Scott: It's it's supposed to count the number of times you skip didn't work.

573
00:39:53,293 --> 00:39:54,509
Scott: No that part totally sucks.

574
00:39:54,650 --> 00:40:05,210
Scott: it doesn't do that for shit because the way it does that is you're supposed to roll the end the weighted end of the Skip it on the ground and every time it spins around It'll count one, you know.

575
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:10,269
Scott: So usually you would get it swinging up in the air and it wouldn't touch the ground and then it wouldn't count.

576
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:12,314
Scott: So the count was worthless.

577
00:40:12,696 --> 00:40:13,860
Rym: I remember moon shoes.

578
00:40:14,483 --> 00:40:17,072
Scott: Oh god, I saw those on TV and I said that's a gimmick I'm not buying it.

579
00:40:17,112 --> 00:40:22,110
Rym: They came out and they were quite quickly recalled for the fact that kids frickin busted their heads open with them.

580
00:40:22,431 --> 00:40:25,361
Scott: Yeah, well, there was that other Nickelodeon stuff the slime or the goop.

581
00:40:25,462 --> 00:40:26,124
Scott: It wasn't goop.

582
00:40:26,385 --> 00:40:27,750
Scott: It wasn't the actual slime.

583
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:31,124
Rym: It was like this other stuff, you know, my brother actually got slimed at Nickelodeon.

584
00:40:31,365 --> 00:40:32,490
Scott: Yeah, so did a bunch of people.

585
00:40:33,373 --> 00:40:38,770
Scott: It's pretty common I mean, let's like think what they bring in a hundred people in there at a time and they do it like a hundred times a day.

586
00:40:39,491 --> 00:40:40,376
Rym: Yeah, but it's cool.

587
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,770
Rym: They got a little certificate like I've been slimed with the real slime.

588
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:44,601
Scott: It's just applesauce and green food coloring.

589
00:40:44,661 --> 00:40:45,969
Rym: I've heard that he didn't try to eat it.

590
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,617
Scott: Yeah, they try to give it.

591
00:40:47,697 --> 00:40:53,788
Rym: all I remember is they let him take a shower and they wash his clothes But they didn't dry his underwear all the way and he was pissed off for the rest of the day.

592
00:40:55,816 --> 00:40:56,268
Scott: bastards.

593
00:40:56,289 --> 00:40:59,869
Scott: I Would totally be pissed off and demand they dry my underwear all the way.

594
00:41:02,431 --> 00:41:06,290
Scott: But did he have to stand there naked while they dried his clothes, oh no, they him a robe or something?

595
00:41:06,411 --> 00:41:06,995
Rym: I don't remember.

596
00:41:07,196 --> 00:41:08,324
Rym: That was a long time ago.

597
00:41:08,485 --> 00:41:09,130
Scott: He's taking the robe.

598
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:14,316
Scott: Go away with the official Nickelodeon robe The one cool.

599
00:41:14,336 --> 00:41:14,901
Rym: So I remember.

600
00:41:14,921 --> 00:41:21,729
Rym: I don't know what these were called either but they were like these I beams and such and you could make like a skeletal building structure or a tower or something.

601
00:41:21,749 --> 00:41:27,332
Rym: and Then they had other devices that you could use to demolish them Mm-hmm.

602
00:41:28,095 --> 00:41:29,017
Rym: They were fairly high quality.

603
00:41:29,057 --> 00:41:30,341
Rym: Once again, I don't remember what they were called.

604
00:41:30,763 --> 00:41:41,650
Scott: I had constructs which were like Is another building toy and you would have basically sticks and little connecty bits and the connecty bits like.

605
00:41:42,112 --> 00:41:42,816
Rym: What like connects?

606
00:41:43,581 --> 00:41:44,970
Rym: no like tinker toys.

607
00:41:45,791 --> 00:41:48,709
Scott: It's sort of like connects in that it sticks that connect at the end.

608
00:41:49,291 --> 00:42:02,521
Scott: But constructs have a different connecting mechanism and everything is nice and square and and uh-huh You could build a really strong stuff with it really easily and it was good for like Spaceships and spacemen and that sort of thing.

609
00:42:02,582 --> 00:42:06,816
Rym: I've noticed I don't really see connects or Tinker toys around so much anymore.

610
00:42:07,017 --> 00:42:08,903
Scott: I see you can get a basic set of Lincoln logs.

611
00:42:08,964 --> 00:42:09,947
Scott: still Lincoln logs.

612
00:42:10,088 --> 00:42:13,420
Scott: actually I Had a lot of fun with Lincoln logs.

613
00:42:13,521 --> 00:42:18,017
Rym: I'm a giant freaking Enormous amazing structures with Lincoln law.

614
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:18,479
Scott: I didn't have it.

615
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,885
Scott: I never had enough Lincoln logs.

616
00:42:19,945 --> 00:42:20,990
Scott: All I could make was a cabin.

617
00:42:21,614 --> 00:42:22,238
Rym: Well, I had enough.

618
00:42:22,258 --> 00:42:29,450
Rym: I actually made like and a four large Cabins that would be level like a flat roof and then there'd be other cabins on top that had like multiple towers.

619
00:42:30,872 --> 00:42:32,222
Scott: I didn't have enough Lincoln logs for that.

620
00:42:32,242 --> 00:42:35,721
Rym: I Once saw my brother and I tried to make the tallest structure we could make.

621
00:42:35,781 --> 00:42:45,924
Rym: I think it was two or three hundred Lincoln log units tall in the end and then it fell over and we almost cried If you want to make something big the key do blows man.

622
00:42:45,944 --> 00:42:47,390
Rym: Oh god do blows.

623
00:42:47,611 --> 00:42:49,280
Rym: I had do blows all over the place.

624
00:42:49,843 --> 00:42:51,190
Scott: We had a giant thing of do blows.

625
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:55,663
Scott: But when we got into Lego not Legos Lego, you know what it's Legos.

626
00:42:56,224 --> 00:42:57,468
Rym: Yeah, let him sue me.

627
00:42:57,548 --> 00:42:58,009
Rym: I'll bring it.

628
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,620
Scott: Yeah, go to Legos calm and you'll see what we're talking about.

629
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:04,677
Scott: Legos calm www.legos.com.

630
00:43:04,978 --> 00:43:07,324
Scott: if you go to le go calm you'll get something different.

631
00:43:08,066 --> 00:43:15,330
Rym: but Lego pretty much Dominated my childhood in way other than Nintendo and Atari in ways that I can't even begin to describe.

632
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:21,430
Scott: Yes, I think we should keep Lego for it's a separate episode because I agree so big we'll do a whole episode on Lego.

633
00:43:21,791 --> 00:43:22,373
Rym: Yeah, Legos.

634
00:43:23,035 --> 00:43:25,001
Scott: I think nerf might also take a separate episode.

635
00:43:25,021 --> 00:43:25,423
Scott: I don't know.

636
00:43:25,443 --> 00:43:27,429
Rym: Oh, I felt so gypped.

637
00:43:27,891 --> 00:43:29,770
Rym: So the nerf bow and arrow, I'll just tell this story.

638
00:43:30,471 --> 00:43:38,189
Rym: Remember the nerf bow and arrow which you don't see the original nerf bow and arrow anymore for sale Which bothers me because it was probably the best nerf toy ever made.

639
00:43:38,711 --> 00:43:41,160
Scott: Probably maybe the ball Zuka stands up there.

640
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,910
Rym: ball Zuka was quality and the arrow storm was awesome.

641
00:43:44,091 --> 00:43:54,330
Rym: Yeah, the arrow storm was just the ball Zuka of the arrows, but yes Yeah See what I did is I modified my arrow storm to shoot the little orange ones from a later gun called like the razor bag Or so one day one that the suction cup there.

642
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:58,690
Scott: Yeah, cuz there's a cup darts bolts and our little arrows and big arrows.

643
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:00,114
Scott: That's those are the nerf weapons.

644
00:44:00,415 --> 00:44:01,057
Rym: Yeah, wait bolts.

645
00:44:01,077 --> 00:44:02,461
Rym: Those are the black ones, right?

646
00:44:03,243 --> 00:44:03,484
Scott: Yeah.

647
00:44:03,664 --> 00:44:03,925
Rym: Yeah.

648
00:44:04,567 --> 00:44:05,650
Rym: I remember I had the black ones.

649
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:07,764
Scott: I use the one that's the sidearm.

650
00:44:07,784 --> 00:44:12,610
Scott: It has three black Yes, and you pump it to shoot each one you with the power of air.

651
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:26,496
Scott: But then there was the suction pistol that you could cock it and have it ready to fire, dude We had like the suction like SMG rifle You'd put a suction dart in the front and pull the whole giant spring-loaded contraption And it would lock.

652
00:44:26,877 --> 00:44:36,718
Scott: and then you when you pulled the trigger it shot a single suction cup dart like freaking hard like BAM Pulled this spring back like six inches.

653
00:44:37,099 --> 00:44:37,761
Scott: It was crazy.

654
00:44:38,122 --> 00:44:38,764
Rym: All right, you know what?

655
00:44:39,085 --> 00:44:40,610
Rym: Yeah, we're gonna do a whole show on nerf, too.

656
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,603
Rym: Yeah, but finish my anecdote.

657
00:44:43,046 --> 00:44:50,210
Rym: Oh my god They sold out when the nerf bow and arrow came out for those of you who are too young to know it sold out immediately.

658
00:44:50,991 --> 00:44:54,527
Rym: Parents were fighting with each other like I know what toy we're talking about next.

659
00:44:54,889 --> 00:45:05,014
Rym: Oh, yeah Oh god, like parents fought with each other and there were lawsuits and oh my god, and my parents only found one and Me and my brother.

660
00:45:05,054 --> 00:45:10,932
Rym: there were two of us and they knew that they couldn't arm one of us and leave the other one out hanging Mm-hmm.

661
00:45:11,434 --> 00:45:20,559
Rym: So apparently they decided for whatever reason they gave my brother the nerf bow and arrow and I got this knockoff Robin Hood bow and arrow and it shot.

662
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:26,779
Rym: actually the arrows that shot were harder and they felt like higher quality But it was an actual bow and arrow.

663
00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:30,876
Rym: as in you pull the string back and let go and those arrows flew Maybe half the distance.

664
00:45:30,916 --> 00:45:31,800
Rym: the nerf bow and arrow did.

665
00:45:32,282 --> 00:45:45,319
Scott: my brother pooned me in a royal way Yeah, but at least the foam darts didn't hurt Yeah, so speaking of toys that are Weaponry based that sell out The super soaker.

666
00:45:45,339 --> 00:45:54,030
Rym: Oh my god That was for once again for those of you who were too young when the super soaker appeared That was a revolution.

667
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:55,474
Scott: Think about this.

668
00:45:55,955 --> 00:46:00,927
Scott: water fights to that day were simply balloons, which is still the deadliest weapon on the field.

669
00:46:01,088 --> 00:46:01,769
Scott: Yes, right?

670
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:07,325
Scott: The little tiny squirt guns which were fun when there wasn't anything bigger on the field.

671
00:46:07,465 --> 00:46:16,208
Scott: or those one-shot bazookas Yeah, where you fill it up in the pool and then you pull it back with you know And you squeeze all the water out in this one-shot bazooka thing.

672
00:46:16,409 --> 00:46:18,165
Rym: now I always carried three squirt guns on me.

673
00:46:18,206 --> 00:46:22,992
Rym: back in the day I had my bazooka which was full and strapped around my back just ready to go Mm-hmm.

674
00:46:23,395 --> 00:46:25,830
Rym: I had a. I had a normal like sidearm rifle II thing.

675
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:28,582
Rym: That was a normal crap squirt gun, you know the clear plastic ones.

676
00:46:29,164 --> 00:46:30,610
Rym: and then I had one that took batteries.

677
00:46:30,811 --> 00:46:32,282
Rym: It was an SMG that took a little.

678
00:46:32,443 --> 00:46:33,390
Scott: those always sucked.

679
00:46:33,811 --> 00:46:34,755
Rym: Oh, it sucked ass.

680
00:46:35,076 --> 00:46:38,470
Rym: it fired like ten shots and it was done and it by these tiny tiny wussy shots.

681
00:46:39,133 --> 00:46:40,278
Scott: But it made a fun noise.

682
00:46:40,359 --> 00:46:42,670
Scott: Those are more fun as toys to play with without the water.

683
00:46:42,891 --> 00:46:45,650
Rym: Actually mine broke almost right away and then I used it as a normal toy.

684
00:46:45,891 --> 00:46:48,299
Scott: Yeah, but don't forget the garden hose.

685
00:46:48,881 --> 00:46:50,929
Rym: No, the garden hose was always like banned.

686
00:46:51,089 --> 00:46:57,870
Scott: No We always had the garden hose is out there and people would get it and then become the king And everyone else wouldn't just run away far out of range.

687
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:58,513
Scott: They would try to get.

688
00:46:58,554 --> 00:46:59,861
Rym: I remember some kids didn't get it.

689
00:46:59,941 --> 00:47:01,550
Rym: like some kids would like shoot me in the chest.

690
00:47:01,691 --> 00:47:03,218
Rym: It depend on what kind of fighting we were playing.

691
00:47:03,238 --> 00:47:03,921
Rym: Sometimes we play.

692
00:47:04,222 --> 00:47:05,749
Rym: Oh you were hit you're out blah blah blah.

693
00:47:06,372 --> 00:47:10,670
Rym: But a lot of times kids were like shoot me in the chest and I shoot them in the eye and I won.

694
00:47:11,452 --> 00:47:18,998
Scott: So one day I because when you were a little kid you always looked in a little Toys R Us circular in the newspaper on Sunday Whatever you saw the Super Soaker in there.

695
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:20,102
Scott: It was yellow and green.

696
00:47:20,443 --> 00:47:22,872
Scott: You might know it as the Super Soaker 50.

697
00:47:22,872 --> 00:47:24,217
Scott: It was the original Super Soaker.

698
00:47:24,317 --> 00:47:29,510
Scott: There was nothing before this and it had this green little Barrel.

699
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:31,493
Scott: What do you want to get?

700
00:47:31,533 --> 00:47:32,738
Rym: jar cylinder?

701
00:47:32,778 --> 00:47:35,168
Scott: I guess cylinder tank tank.

702
00:47:35,208 --> 00:47:42,630
Rym: There you go And you pumped it up and It pressurized and I didn't get what the big deal was because I saw that I saw a picture of it.

703
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:43,817
Scott: I said that's a water gun.

704
00:47:43,837 --> 00:47:46,170
Scott: That's the silliest looking water gun I ever seen but a piece of junk.

705
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:46,855
Scott: It's just a gimmick.

706
00:47:47,157 --> 00:47:49,774
Scott: then I saw it on TV and I was like It's just a gimmick.

707
00:47:50,056 --> 00:47:55,358
Scott: then as soon as one kid on the block got one everyone ran to the toy store immediately.

708
00:47:55,378 --> 00:48:05,630
Rym: because I guess the revolution was until that point the I mean Basically the only dominating weapon on the field other than water balloons Which are kind of rare because our parents would always make us pick up the leavings afterward.

709
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,629
Scott: Yeah No one ever actually bought water balloons.

710
00:48:08,851 --> 00:48:14,773
Rym: So every now and then someone I had a friend who had a water balloon slingshot some kid would go somewhere and he'd get the ones That look like grenades.

711
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:15,716
Rym: Those were terrible.

712
00:48:15,817 --> 00:48:19,389
Rym: They were you gotta get normal balloons fill them up and drop them on someone.

713
00:48:19,449 --> 00:48:29,550
Rym: Yep but I mean you pull the trigger and it'd be one little squirt and it would barely go anywhere and you had to keep pulling and Pulling and pulling and pulling and the bazooka was great, but you had one shot and then you were done.

714
00:48:29,911 --> 00:48:31,275
Scott: You couldn't actually get anyone wet.

715
00:48:31,937 --> 00:48:36,370
Rym: the super soaker was a bazooka that just kept firing for as long as you held that trigger down.

716
00:48:36,551 --> 00:48:37,699
Scott: You can just hold it down to this.

717
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,270
Scott: constant stream of water came out.

718
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:45,230
Scott: It wasn't the biggest stream of water, but you could pump keep I would think I'm thinking until the release valve went.

719
00:48:46,291 --> 00:48:47,396
Rym: Yeah, and I'd know all right.

720
00:48:47,476 --> 00:48:48,821
Rym: I'm at maximum capacity.

721
00:48:49,002 --> 00:48:50,910
Scott: It built mad arm strength and little kids.

722
00:48:51,113 --> 00:49:01,406
Rym: Let me tell you though I got to say I remember many moments where like my opponent wouldn't would not be pumping up continuously throughout the battle and He'd start to slack in and then I'd have more range than him.

723
00:49:01,426 --> 00:49:01,989
Rym: and that was the end.

724
00:49:02,371 --> 00:49:06,188
Scott: Yeah, remember it was called the super soaker 50 because it shot up to 50 feet.

725
00:49:07,072 --> 00:49:22,550
Scott: Well, uh, then the super soaker 100 came out, you know Let me tell you the story about the super soaker 100. see we went to the store to get a super soaker 50 for me to compete with the neighborhood kids with their 50s and The toy works which is the store at the Times.

726
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:26,319
Rym: Mmm, that's why I had an onion on my belt.

727
00:49:26,721 --> 00:49:27,604
Scott: Yep, of course.

728
00:49:27,665 --> 00:49:28,950
Scott: It was a white onion, whatever.

729
00:49:30,851 --> 00:49:35,845
Scott: They were sold out of 50s, of course, of course makes angry in the Turlet.

730
00:49:36,186 --> 00:49:40,264
Scott: All right, that's just two three Three references in like a minute.

731
00:49:40,345 --> 00:49:42,835
Scott: Okay They were sold out of 50s.

732
00:49:43,357 --> 00:49:47,969
Scott: while we were standing in the store in the morning a shipment of super soakers came in.

733
00:49:48,896 --> 00:49:55,484
Scott: all of them were a hundreds and It wasn't too difficult to get my mom to buy me the hundred because there were no fifties.

734
00:49:55,785 --> 00:50:06,310
Rym: now before Scott describes his Dominance of the battlefield that ensued from having this this brand new weapon I mean this is like in civilization too when you get gunpowder and all your well.

735
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:13,577
Rym: No, no, no, the super soaker 50 was gunpowder versus non gunpowder, you know Musketeers versus Knights kenigits.

736
00:50:13,638 --> 00:50:16,990
Rym: as Scott says the super soaker hundred was when you got riflemen.

737
00:50:18,093 --> 00:50:24,289
Scott: the super soaker 100 had The first water gun ever with the reserve pressurization tank.

738
00:50:24,752 --> 00:50:28,050
Rym: So you'd pump it up and it would fill both of your tanks with pressure.

739
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:28,616
Scott: Well, no what?

740
00:50:28,899 --> 00:50:29,970
Scott: that's not what it would do at all.

741
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:34,688
Rym: Actually now it would because if you pumped it wrong, you could see the bubbles coming into the reserve tank.

742
00:50:34,888 --> 00:50:36,555
Scott: No, no No, that's when you're pumping it right.

743
00:50:37,058 --> 00:50:38,584
Scott: you see the way it worked is.

744
00:50:38,624 --> 00:50:41,958
Scott: there was the front tank Which is just where you stored all your water.

745
00:50:41,978 --> 00:50:53,986
Scott: All right, and but normally the super soaker 50 Pressurizes that main tank Right and then you release the pressure from it until it kind of loses its stuff and that's it.

746
00:50:54,247 --> 00:50:56,476
Scott: and because it's so big And it has all your water in it.

747
00:50:56,557 --> 00:50:58,245
Scott: It's not really, you know, it doesn't work.

748
00:50:58,325 --> 00:50:59,250
Scott: It's like a direct system.

749
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:07,996
Rym: Well, it has two main problems one when you refuel, you know put water back in While you're filling your thing up you're done You have no way to protect yourself.

750
00:51:08,338 --> 00:51:11,010
Rym: and two once you fill it in you have to then pump it up before you can shoot.

751
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:24,230
Scott: Yeah, now I remember holding down the trigger and pumping simultaneously super circle 100 behind the main tank of water Which is bigger than the tank of water on the super soaker 50 was a small like ball.

752
00:51:24,534 --> 00:51:25,830
Scott: It was like the size of a baseball.

753
00:51:26,091 --> 00:51:28,380
Scott: It was another tank and you never open that tank.

754
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,427
Scott: it stayed closed all the time.

755
00:51:30,468 --> 00:51:32,337
Scott: You didn't open it You didn't do anything to it now.

756
00:51:32,357 --> 00:51:37,421
Scott: when you pumped it would take water From a reservoir from the main tank.

757
00:51:37,822 --> 00:51:39,810
Scott: All right and put it into that little ball.

758
00:51:40,452 --> 00:51:50,330
Scott: now the little ball was already filled with air also from your pumping and The ball also had a much thicker plastic than the main water reservoir tank.

759
00:51:51,012 --> 00:51:56,090
Scott: So basically you would fill this little ball up with water and air to the point of it exploding.

760
00:51:56,172 --> 00:51:59,650
Rym: Yeah And the thing is the super soakers you couldn't actually make them explode.

761
00:52:00,172 --> 00:52:10,930
Rym: now that I'm older and I realize there's a rubber hose that went through it where the water and everything came out and the trigger Released a. basically there's a pin like constricting the flow so nothing could get out.

762
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:15,530
Scott: It was like when you kink the garden hose bite, you know, and when you pull the trigger it unkinks the garden hose.

763
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:23,651
Rym: Yep But if you put too much pressure It would leak out a little bit through the kink and then it would like maintain a solid steady not blow up and kill a kid Pressure.

764
00:52:23,832 --> 00:52:31,240
Scott: Yeah, but if you somehow modify the trigger to keep that kink there no matter what pressure comes out, you know, you can Destroy yourself.

765
00:52:31,462 --> 00:52:32,110
Rym: Yeah, you'll die.

766
00:52:32,351 --> 00:52:51,589
Scott: Yeah, but anyway you had this reserve tank that you would fill with water and pressure and when you released it Not only was it more powerful than the 50 not only did it shoot farther with more water for a greater amount of time But you could take the main tank off because it wasn't pressurized at all Fill it up with water again while you were shooting the water out of the reserve tank.

767
00:52:53,171 --> 00:52:56,281
Scott: So whatever all the kids are gathered around the hose to refill you just shoot them up.

768
00:52:57,103 --> 00:53:00,494
Rym: and then I saw they started selling Extra tanks.

769
00:53:00,935 --> 00:53:05,770
Rym: Yeah, they came in a little like backpack thing and you could have a two extra backup tanks on you.

770
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:08,439
Scott: There was even one super soaker that they eventually had.

771
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,485
Rym: It was like the 200 or I don't know what it was.

772
00:53:10,526 --> 00:53:14,837
Scott: It had the quick replacement tanks that you didn't have to screw in.

773
00:53:14,977 --> 00:53:20,910
Scott: you could just snap them in and out and you could fill them by jamming them In the into this attachment at the end of the garden hose.

774
00:53:21,591 --> 00:53:32,137
Scott: so at the end of the garden hose is a little like launch pad and you would stick the end of the bottle in there and It would fill it up real quick and you can just pull bottles out of your gun and throw them away and stick new ones In like click click.

775
00:53:32,822 --> 00:53:36,790
Scott: it was like, you know Almost as fast as switching like magazines in an assault rifle.

776
00:53:37,011 --> 00:53:37,292
Rym: Of course.

777
00:53:37,312 --> 00:53:42,490
Rym: this arms race of super soakers eventually met its end with the final one that I cared about.

778
00:53:42,831 --> 00:53:48,512
Rym: I I be any super soaker beyond this one was when I didn't play with super soakers anymore Mm-hmm.

779
00:53:49,235 --> 00:54:07,462
Rym: It was a backpack filled with like multiple gallons of water and A giant gun and they were connected and you pumped it up like a super soaker and it was the most dangerous thing in the world Except for the fact that the kid wearing it and I remember the kid named Dave my neighborhood whose parents got it for him He couldn't even move in the thing.

780
00:54:07,502 --> 00:54:08,187
Rym: It weighed so much.

781
00:54:09,072 --> 00:54:11,201
Scott: See, I remember that one, but no one actually got that.

782
00:54:11,382 --> 00:54:11,965
Scott: there was the.

783
00:54:11,985 --> 00:54:13,632
Scott: let's see which other ones Do I remember.

784
00:54:13,973 --> 00:54:20,424
Scott: there was the one that had two barrels and it was like two super soaker hundreds attached to each other But with the XP technology.

785
00:54:20,444 --> 00:54:22,661
Scott: remember they had these super You know XP was.

786
00:54:22,722 --> 00:54:23,729
Rym: it just emptied your tank.

787
00:54:24,031 --> 00:54:27,630
Scott: Well, it emptied your tank and basically the barrels were twice as wide.

788
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:30,610
Scott: So your spray was more powerful and got people more wet.

789
00:54:31,272 --> 00:54:35,108
Scott: It was extra wetness is what it was, but it also emptied your tank a little faster.

790
00:54:35,148 --> 00:54:35,550
Scott: So whatever.

791
00:54:36,852 --> 00:54:38,016
Scott: But then came the.

792
00:54:38,679 --> 00:54:41,530
Scott: my brother had the biggest XP super soaker.

793
00:54:41,691 --> 00:54:54,890
Scott: It was basically this it looked like a giant laser rifle for Makira And it emptied in about four or five full power shots Maybe even three if you if you pumped it up real all the way and had like a pressure meter and everything.

794
00:54:55,395 --> 00:55:05,958
Scott: But the when it shot it shot about Had to be at least a liter of water in a blast Like a half an inch wide.

795
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:08,570
Scott: and then of course came the whatever that giant was.

796
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:10,035
Scott: We saw a freshman year of college.

797
00:55:10,276 --> 00:55:13,367
Scott: That was like two giant the monster XXL.

798
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:13,788
Scott: That was it.

799
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:17,950
Rym: See that was the point when I had moved on from water gun fights to pranking people.

800
00:55:18,212 --> 00:55:27,550
Rym: Yeah, and instead of having a water fight We had a water balloon slingshot and we would launch water balloons at our friend's house like around the corner and down the street.

801
00:55:27,771 --> 00:55:30,666
Scott: Yeah went by the time the monster came out super soakers were done.

802
00:55:30,888 --> 00:55:31,330
Scott: That was it.

803
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:31,952
Scott: It was too much.

804
00:55:32,453 --> 00:55:39,050
Rym: of course in that same era nerf which we'll do another show on had many water fight enabled nerf weapons.

805
00:55:39,893 --> 00:55:44,530
Rym: There were a lot of arrows that had a sponge on the end that you could dip in water and held a lot of water.

806
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:47,268
Rym: Surprisingly and if you hit someone with it, they were just talking wet.

807
00:55:47,349 --> 00:55:49,912
Rym: it was So.

808
00:55:50,112 --> 00:55:53,242
Scott: when I was real little my favorite toy was a glow worm.

809
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,508
Rym: I was a big fan of my light.

810
00:55:55,549 --> 00:55:55,789
Rym: bright.

811
00:55:56,492 --> 00:55:57,115
Scott: Light brights good.

812
00:55:57,136 --> 00:55:59,166
Scott: That's where you put the pegs in the thing that lights up.

813
00:55:59,528 --> 00:56:03,463
Scott: Yeah Yeah, that goes with Etch-a-sketch and magnet oodle.

814
00:56:03,784 --> 00:56:03,945
Rym: Yeah.

815
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:05,390
Rym: No magnet oodle was awesome.

816
00:56:05,611 --> 00:56:06,715
Rym: Ours wore out.

817
00:56:06,755 --> 00:56:07,096
Rym: from years.

818
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:07,879
Scott: ours wore out.

819
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,666
Scott: magnet oodle seemed to always wear out.

820
00:56:09,726 --> 00:56:10,730
Scott: You keep buying new ones.

821
00:56:11,431 --> 00:56:15,290
Rym: It's like a piece of crap - I used to manually play a little Sim City on mine.

822
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:17,479
Rym: I draw everything bit by bit as I built it up.

823
00:56:17,921 --> 00:56:18,322
Scott: Oh, wow.

824
00:56:18,885 --> 00:56:20,090
Rym: Yeah, I was a geeky little kid.

825
00:56:20,371 --> 00:56:21,054
Scott: Yeah, that's crazy.

826
00:56:21,416 --> 00:56:24,470
Rym: Actually a game that I played a lot as a child was hero quest.

827
00:56:25,350 --> 00:56:38,346
Rym: Mmm, I blame that for a lot of my interest in role-playing games today because my dad got hero quest and he would be the master for me and my little brother and We played through that whole game and eventually we kicked Evil's ass and it was over.

828
00:56:38,366 --> 00:56:41,159
Rym: Mm-hmm All I remember is that I swear to you.

829
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,570
Rym: my little brother cheated stole the game.

830
00:56:43,974 --> 00:56:47,778
Rym: Read the book found out where that Boris's or borax whatever armor was.

831
00:56:47,798 --> 00:56:54,403
Rym: because when we got to the level and we knew from the clues from the old man that the Armor was somewhere there He friggin runs right to the room.

832
00:56:54,443 --> 00:56:55,209
Rym: He was in and gets it.

833
00:56:56,711 --> 00:56:57,454
Scott: Yeah, he read the book.

834
00:56:58,036 --> 00:56:59,542
Rym: Yeah, he denies it to this day.

835
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:00,365
Rym: But god damn it.

836
00:57:00,767 --> 00:57:03,597
Rym: I was the barbarian I needed that arm only he'll deny it today.

837
00:57:03,617 --> 00:57:03,958
Scott: Yes.

838
00:57:03,998 --> 00:57:05,222
Rym: He was now if he had spells.

839
00:57:05,764 --> 00:57:06,707
Rym: What does he need armor for?

840
00:57:06,727 --> 00:57:09,399
Rym: Mm-hmm Of course I had an axe so I got him.

841
00:57:09,419 --> 00:57:11,390
Scott: then he just chopped him up and took the armor.

842
00:57:12,515 --> 00:57:16,393
Rym: No, actually, no, I didn't know was No, the board games.

843
00:57:16,453 --> 00:57:19,461
Scott: I played I was a little kid were like dino bones.

844
00:57:19,501 --> 00:57:22,809
Scott: God candy land candy land all that stuff.

845
00:57:23,372 --> 00:57:25,207
Rym: I like monopoly a lot when I was a little kid.

846
00:57:25,227 --> 00:57:25,952
Scott: Yeah, me too I like.

847
00:57:26,093 --> 00:57:28,270
Scott: I guess I like that stuff when I was little but not anymore.

848
00:57:28,772 --> 00:57:31,362
Rym: Actually, one of my favorite games was don't break the ice don't break.

849
00:57:31,382 --> 00:57:32,306
Scott: The ice is a good game.

850
00:57:32,747 --> 00:57:34,154
Rym: cooties Didn't?

851
00:57:34,235 --> 00:57:35,548
Rym: I actually never played cooties?

852
00:57:36,195 --> 00:57:37,770
Scott: And I don't remember how to play cooties.

853
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:41,469
Scott: I think I might have played it once but it's in the same series as don't break the ice don't spill the beans.

854
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:46,150
Scott: No the beans, which is I don't know how to play that but it had a pair of pants that you filled with beans.

855
00:57:46,752 --> 00:57:48,358
Rym: Yeah, there's also ants in the pants.

856
00:57:49,061 --> 00:57:50,707
Scott: Oh, maybe I'm confusing those two games.

857
00:57:51,189 --> 00:57:52,520
Rym: Yeah I don't know what you're talking about.

858
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:55,797
Rym: pants filled with beans I guess I confused.

859
00:57:56,179 --> 00:58:01,205
Scott: don't spill the beans and ants in the pants And just beans in the pants.

860
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:04,461
Scott: Don't spill the ants, I don't know.

861
00:58:04,843 --> 00:58:05,930
Rym: we had this memory game.

862
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:08,461
Rym: I forgot it was called but it was like remembering things.

863
00:58:08,481 --> 00:58:10,590
Rym: game and my little brother.

864
00:58:11,453 --> 00:58:16,430
Rym: I don't know what it was, but he would kick our entire family's ass no matter what was it called?

865
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:20,270
Scott: Memory might have been because there was a board game called memory.

866
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:21,133
Rym: Will you go around?

867
00:58:21,154 --> 00:58:24,467
Rym: you have to remember like it's like the card games and like mario 3.

868
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:26,133
Scott: Yeah, exactly Yeah, that's all.

869
00:58:26,174 --> 00:58:28,301
Scott: the game was was that with pictures on cards.

870
00:58:28,582 --> 00:58:28,803
Rym: Yep.

871
00:58:29,304 --> 00:58:30,890
Scott: Oh, what about pop goes perfection?

872
00:58:32,191 --> 00:58:36,710
Scott: That game you said the timer you to put all the pieces in the holes and then push the stop button.

873
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:37,793
Rym: I had the versus one.

874
00:58:37,813 --> 00:58:43,429
Rym: Oh, you have two people and they're rare images of each other and it had the best game mechanic ever.

875
00:58:45,011 --> 00:58:54,249
Rym: well other than you know Tigers and Euphrates game mechanics, but basically if You know in perfection if you don't make it in time it like pops up and scares the shit out of you.

876
00:58:54,571 --> 00:58:59,430
Rym: Mm-hmm this one when you finish well one there was a timer and if it ran out it pops it up on both of you.

877
00:58:59,852 --> 00:59:04,130
Rym: But as soon as you finish you had a button you get hit on your side a big spacebar and it popped the other guy.

878
00:59:04,411 --> 00:59:07,525
Scott: Yes, of course, you could pop the other guy right away and you know what.

879
00:59:07,685 --> 00:59:08,569
Rym: then they'd hit you.

880
00:59:09,031 --> 00:59:12,465
Scott: Yeah, that goes to Simon - ah Simon.

881
00:59:12,907 --> 00:59:13,690
Scott: I never got Simon.

882
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:17,282
Scott: I was played at other people's houses, but it I got over real quick.

883
00:59:17,563 --> 00:59:19,108
Rym: Yeah, my friend Joe Oglesby had.

884
00:59:21,573 --> 00:59:22,339
Rym: I didn't actually have it.

885
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,166
Rym: I was pretty good at it.

886
00:59:23,206 --> 00:59:23,508
Rym: I liked it.

887
00:59:23,790 --> 00:59:26,626
Scott: It was okay, but it's not a toy that you can play with for a long time.

888
00:59:26,686 --> 00:59:27,290
Rym: He had this toy.

889
00:59:27,512 --> 00:59:29,130
Rym: It was an afterburner type game.

890
00:59:29,394 --> 00:59:30,954
Rym: It was a video game But it's one of those.

891
00:59:31,175 --> 00:59:44,164
Rym: you buy a VHS tape and you play it And then you have this thing the light gun that you like pointed the screen and you have to shoot the tail Jets of planes going by and had some sort of pseudo optical reader on it.

892
00:59:44,385 --> 00:59:47,356
Rym: Mm-hmm, and he thought it was awesome But it was kind of dumb.

893
00:59:47,778 --> 00:59:50,530
Scott: Yeah, I never liked any of those VHS games.

894
00:59:51,112 --> 00:59:55,470
Scott: Of course what I did like that we only played once ever was actually really dumb.

895
00:59:56,211 --> 00:59:58,963
Scott: It's one of those the game where you have the little football man.

896
00:59:58,983 --> 01:00:00,410
Scott: you set them up and then it vibrates.

897
01:00:00,712 --> 01:00:03,071
Rym: Oh my brother wanted that for most of his life like.

898
01:00:03,492 --> 01:00:07,125
Rym: he'd see it on TV and he'd see it in the Sears catalog and he'd be like I want it.

899
01:00:07,165 --> 01:00:07,868
Rym: it's the best thing ever.

900
01:00:07,888 --> 01:00:11,024
Rym: and Finally one day my parents got it for like for Christmas.

901
01:00:11,366 --> 01:00:11,990
Rym: There's a big deal.

902
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:17,313
Rym: We set it up and we ran it and then he he was the most crestfallen kid I've ever seen Mm-hmm.

903
01:00:17,615 --> 01:00:17,917
Rym: It just.

904
01:00:18,279 --> 01:00:19,245
Rym: it was like wait a minute.

905
01:00:19,265 --> 01:00:23,810
Scott: They just Move around randomly, you know something you want to hear something real scary.

906
01:00:24,374 --> 01:00:25,322
Scott: My family actually.

907
01:00:25,382 --> 01:00:30,450
Scott: we played that once Which is me and my brother and my dad versus my uncle and my cousins.

908
01:00:30,973 --> 01:00:33,408
Scott: We actually played like a whole football came out on that thing.

909
01:00:33,468 --> 01:00:33,750
Scott: It was great.

910
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:36,980
Scott: We like did a little we passed and we made plays and it was great.

911
01:00:37,422 --> 01:00:39,970
Rym: See we were really big into you know, spinny hockey.

912
01:00:41,071 --> 01:00:42,619
Rym: Oh, yeah, we had one of those.

913
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:44,005
Rym: we played it often.

914
01:00:44,045 --> 01:00:44,950
Rym: That's why I'm so good at it.

915
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:47,036
Scott: Oh, we didn't have one of those we had.

916
01:00:47,317 --> 01:00:49,063
Scott: we also had we had knock hockey.

917
01:00:49,163 --> 01:00:50,267
Scott: Knock hockey was the shit.

918
01:00:51,089 --> 01:00:53,939
Scott: Ah And I should probably try to get a knock hockey table.

919
01:00:53,959 --> 01:00:54,762
Scott: they're hard to get now.

920
01:00:55,003 --> 01:00:56,288
Rym: we had actually no kids.

921
01:00:56,308 --> 01:00:56,770
Scott: they're getting one.

922
01:00:57,231 --> 01:01:00,766
Rym: We had a bumper pool table when I was real young which wasn't.

923
01:01:00,846 --> 01:01:03,525
Rym: I wasn't old enough to use it But then we got a real pool table.

924
01:01:03,747 --> 01:01:08,190
Scott: Nope It seemed like everyone we knew had one except us and we had a foosball table.

925
01:01:08,411 --> 01:01:09,960
Rym: No, but I was never good at foosball.

926
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:11,710
Rym: My little brother was a frickin foosball prodigy.

927
01:01:12,173 --> 01:01:18,609
Rym: No, I remember when I was little and indignant I never would play against him because he'd always beat me and he'd always get mad because I wouldn't play against him.

928
01:01:19,054 --> 01:01:20,069
Scott: It was also a crossfire.

929
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:23,816
Rym: Crossfire was the most awesome game.

930
01:01:24,237 --> 01:01:28,629
Scott: Oh my I mean you just put these two little basically these metal marbles and his playing field.

931
01:01:28,649 --> 01:01:33,170
Scott: and There were two metal marbles crossfire crossfire.

932
01:01:33,491 --> 01:01:38,806
Scott: One metal marble had a plastic chainsaw around it and the other one was a triangle.

933
01:01:38,846 --> 01:01:41,536
Rym: the other one had a plastic triangle and that One was a lot harder to move.

934
01:01:41,616 --> 01:01:44,370
Scott: Yeah, one guy was the triangle and one guy was the chainsaw.

935
01:01:45,591 --> 01:01:55,446
Scott: And what you tried to do was you had this gun that would shoot the metal marbles from your side to the other guy's Side and you could take marbles from your side and put them in your gun to reload.

936
01:01:55,566 --> 01:01:56,590
Rym: the gun would jam easily.

937
01:01:56,691 --> 01:02:06,649
Scott: You had to be mad skilled yeah, so you would shoot these metal marbles at the triangle and the chainsaw trying to push them to the other guy's side and It was fun a lot of fun.

938
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:11,670
Rym: See well, my brother and I played a different because we couldn't agree because no one ever wanted to be the chainsaw.

939
01:02:12,417 --> 01:02:20,130
Rym: so we just played as Both of them shoot them both in either direction and the first one person to have any one of them fall into their side loses.

940
01:02:20,754 --> 01:02:23,550
Scott: Oh, just go everyone just go for the chainsaw and screw the triangle.

941
01:02:23,972 --> 01:02:28,109
Rym: No, cuz I'd edge the triangle over there bit by bit and it was actually it worked out pretty well.

942
01:02:28,811 --> 01:02:31,218
Scott: Now the thing in that game those once it's too close.

943
01:02:31,258 --> 01:02:33,365
Scott: You can't get it out of there without touching it.

944
01:02:34,026 --> 01:02:34,408
Rym: Yeah.

945
01:02:34,428 --> 01:02:46,283
Rym: Yeah The big problems I always had with the game was one My parents never let me play it because if you've never seen this game first of all Firing an individual BB made a loud clacking noise.

946
01:02:46,303 --> 01:02:46,765
Rym: Oh, yeah.

947
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:48,430
Scott: This game was like click click click click click.

948
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:50,849
Scott: No, it was like bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang.

949
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:59,837
Rym: We're just crazy screaming noise pieces of plastic wailing against each other and kids yelling and screaming - you would shoot maybe I don't know.

950
01:02:59,898 --> 01:03:07,606
Rym: a hundred thousand of these BB's over the course of one game Mm-hmm, and it was really hard to pull the trigger and I would get blisters early.

951
01:03:07,627 --> 01:03:08,590
Scott: Maybe yours is broken.

952
01:03:09,033 --> 01:03:11,210
Rym: I was hard to pull the trigger unless you wore it like wore it out.

953
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:13,090
Scott: Well, we never had that problem.

954
01:03:13,877 --> 01:03:15,250
Scott: Maybe it was a different version to the game.

955
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:17,262
Rym: I might have been cuz all the force all.

956
01:03:17,282 --> 01:03:18,570
Rym: they didn't have a spring or anything.

957
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:22,983
Rym: It shot the ball by having you pull the trigger against resistance which then pushed the BB out.

958
01:03:23,184 --> 01:03:23,385
Scott: Yep.

959
01:03:23,445 --> 01:03:24,027
Scott: That's what it did.

960
01:03:24,047 --> 01:03:26,870
Rym: Oh Well, there's also that game.

961
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:32,774
Rym: I figured it was called where you had the ships that you put on a big mat on the floor like a big cardboard board And then you eat.

962
01:03:32,834 --> 01:03:33,920
Rym: each side you had a submarine.

963
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:35,950
Rym: you flicked little red discs at the other guy's fleet.

964
01:03:36,651 --> 01:03:37,636
Scott: I don't remember that at all.

965
01:03:37,656 --> 01:03:40,550
Rym: It's a really good game except that it also gave me blisters, huh?

966
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:43,680
Scott: Now I'm remembering things like chutes and ladders.

967
01:03:43,901 --> 01:03:44,784
Scott: That was a good game.

968
01:03:44,944 --> 01:03:45,486
Rym: Not really.

969
01:03:45,506 --> 01:03:46,188
Scott: It was good.

970
01:03:46,208 --> 01:03:47,814
Scott: when you're a little kid It's better than Candyland.

971
01:03:48,416 --> 01:03:50,443
Rym: We always like payday cuz it involved real money.

972
01:03:50,484 --> 01:03:52,250
Rym: It was like it seemed like it was edutainment.

973
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:57,270
Scott: I remember seeing the board for that game and I see seeing the box but I don't know what that game was.

974
01:03:57,491 --> 01:04:00,140
Rym: It was us now paying our bills.

975
01:04:00,822 --> 01:04:03,110
Rym: Wow, but for a kid who doesn't pay bills, it was awesome.

976
01:04:03,891 --> 01:04:04,694
Scott: Yeah, what else do we have?

977
01:04:05,196 --> 01:04:05,637
Scott: We had free.

978
01:04:05,678 --> 01:04:08,950
Scott: parking was actually a really good game with a monopoly theme.

979
01:04:09,811 --> 01:04:11,823
Scott: That had nothing to do with monopoly except the theme.

980
01:04:12,165 --> 01:04:13,070
Rym: Wait, was that the dice game?

981
01:04:13,471 --> 01:04:14,830
Scott: No, I had nothing to do with dice whatsoever.

982
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:19,750
Scott: You had a parking meter and you didn't want it to go expire and you'd keep filling the meter.

983
01:04:20,451 --> 01:04:23,021
Scott: But you could also get officer Jones to go get people.

984
01:04:23,041 --> 01:04:24,767
Scott: There's an officer Jones card.

985
01:04:24,787 --> 01:04:25,450
Scott: I think I have the game.

986
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:25,897
Scott: We'll play it.

987
01:04:26,303 --> 01:04:28,776
Scott: Aha It'll be alright.

988
01:04:28,978 --> 01:04:34,940
Scott: I'm sure it's not the greatest game but Millborn I was about to say Millborn saw the same genre.

989
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:38,230
Rym: I had a knockoff shareware version on the computer called Miles bones.

990
01:04:38,734 --> 01:04:40,350
Scott: Yeah, we had the real deal.

991
01:04:41,731 --> 01:04:42,514
Rym: It's all right game.

992
01:04:42,554 --> 01:04:44,663
Rym: now that I I'm more versed in German.

993
01:04:44,703 --> 01:04:46,370
Rym: this I'm not so much of a fan of it.

994
01:04:47,412 --> 01:04:55,450
Scott: Yeah, I guess these games really only have nostalgia Factors, you know the old kitty game member of volcano run or whatever it was called?

995
01:04:56,691 --> 01:04:58,379
Rym: No, it was a gimmicky game.

996
01:04:58,439 --> 01:05:00,127
Rym: It was probably the first of the gimmicky games.

997
01:05:00,147 --> 01:05:00,830
Rym: That was really market.

998
01:05:01,031 --> 01:05:04,570
Rym: I thought dizzy-dizzy dinosaur was the first gimmick, you know, this game came out before that.

999
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:06,177
Scott: I thought mousetrap came out in the 50s.

1000
01:05:06,398 --> 01:05:07,945
Rym: Yeah, mousetrap was the first one.

1001
01:05:09,392 --> 01:05:13,290
Rym: But this game like stormed the world as a gimmick.

1002
01:05:13,515 --> 01:05:23,305
Rym: All right you move guys around on a volcano but huh if the volcano erupts you take a little volcano ball and put at the top and Decide where it comes out and then it rolls along and knocks guys over.

1003
01:05:23,325 --> 01:05:25,653
Scott: Oh Remember now.

1004
01:05:25,873 --> 01:05:29,603
Scott: Yeah, it reminds me the agro Craig and all the agro Craig.

1005
01:05:30,144 --> 01:05:31,167
Scott: anyone doesn't know what that is.

1006
01:05:31,728 --> 01:05:34,161
Rym: Shut up Don't make me feel old.

1007
01:05:34,545 --> 01:05:46,390
Scott: the Dizzy-dizzy dinosaur was the one where you would move around the board but occasionally you would turn on this little dinosaur and he would spin around and Bump into you and if he bumped into your guy you had to go back to the beginning or something, right?

1008
01:05:47,591 --> 01:05:48,977
Rym: Yeah, I don't remember eggs around.

1009
01:05:49,137 --> 01:05:51,950
Scott: you're trying to move eggs around the map without getting dizzy-dizzy dinosaur to hit you.

1010
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:53,475
Rym: I remember this alligator dentist.

1011
01:05:53,496 --> 01:05:54,459
Rym: We had to pull teeth.

1012
01:05:54,479 --> 01:05:55,503
Scott: I remember the alligator dentist.

1013
01:05:55,563 --> 01:05:56,266
Scott: I saw the commercials.

1014
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:57,410
Scott: They didn't buy that piece of crap.

1015
01:05:57,592 --> 01:05:58,830
Rym: Yeah, I don't think we actually owned it.

1016
01:05:58,870 --> 01:06:01,220
Rym: I think one of her little cousins owned it and we had to play it with him.

1017
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:09,062
Scott: The worst Hanukkah ever was when My mom was like, oh I got a good prod I got a good present for the last day right.

1018
01:06:09,404 --> 01:06:13,321
Scott: and then on the second last day I'm like, I was looking at the toy catalog and I was like, it's mr.

1019
01:06:13,382 --> 01:06:14,044
Scott: Bucket, isn't it?

1020
01:06:14,406 --> 01:06:15,370
Scott: It's a toy for everybody.

1021
01:06:15,490 --> 01:06:15,972
Scott: You got mr.

01:06:15,993 --> 01:06:18,985
Scott: Bucket because you thought it's cute, but it's not and it's gonna be no fun.

1023
01:06:19,487 --> 01:06:20,009
Rym: the hell's a mr.

1024
01:06:20,330 --> 01:06:21,698
Scott: Bucket, this is the worst thing ever.

1025
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,610
Scott: I don't know why my mom thought it was gonna be a good idea.

1026
01:06:24,612 --> 01:06:28,009
Scott: It's his bucket right and okay the bucket has.

1027
01:06:29,031 --> 01:06:44,950
Scott: It's a robotic bucket and it moves around with wheels on the floor right and it has a mouth with a and the mouth has a hole in it and He has two hands above his head that go like this to keep you from putting things in the bucket.

1028
01:06:45,452 --> 01:06:49,449
Scott: Oh god, I saw commercials for that and he opens and closes his eyes all the time.

1029
01:06:49,509 --> 01:06:55,573
Scott: now He spits out these balls and you have a shovel and you have to pick up the balls with a shovel and put him In the bucket.

1030
01:06:55,673 --> 01:06:58,430
Scott: and if you get all your balls in the bucket, then you win.

1031
01:06:58,470 --> 01:07:04,678
Scott: so basically, it's just everyone runs around the room picking up balls and putting them in the bucket and After about two times, it's not fun anymore.

1032
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:06,065
