1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,373
Rym: It's Thursday January 26th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:15,840
Rym: We finish up our series on how to attend a convention.

3
00:00:16,782 --> 00:00:28,278
Scott: Let's do this alright, so Rym went to Rochester for anime club, but actually he didn't because it's still Wednesday, and he's right there And we're just recording this right now.

4
00:00:28,781 --> 00:00:34,539
Scott: You know with just me to give the illusion that we're actually recording Thursday when we're not.

5
00:00:35,322 --> 00:00:43,220
Rym: Actually, I'm packing and I'm doing post-production for the two episodes before I go out of town So I don't have time to actually talk on the show today, right?

6
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:59,360
Scott: But you people listening will be hearing this Thursday night Unless you happen to be cool enough to be on our forums in which case you would get this the day early Which is when it was made and so if you're not in our forums, you should probably join them.

7
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:15,920
Scott: So even if you don't join the discussion on the forums At least become a member so that you know when we release a podcast early or make a special announcement You can be the first one there and also when we we're gonna redesign our blog the the theme on the front page of front.

8
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:26,367
Scott: recruit calm at some point in the future when we finalize our logo and all that and you will no longer be able to comment on The different entries there.

9
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:29,500
Scott: so the forum is going to be the only place for discussion to happen.

10
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:39,960
Scott: So if you're a regular listener join the forum, I don't know how many times I'm gonna have to tell people to do this until Eventually one day I'll have to tell them not to join because there's too many people there.

11
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:45,504
Scott: Anyway, so it being Really Wednesday.

12
00:01:45,524 --> 00:01:49,299
Scott: I don't have any Thursday news, but I do have an awesome thing of the day.

13
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:57,569
Scott: It's this video of this 12 year old kid Playing the drums drum solo no band.

14
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:58,451
Scott: No singers.

15
00:01:58,531 --> 00:01:58,932
Scott: No nothing.

16
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:05,264
Scott: It's just his kid on his own playing the drums and I gotta say For 12 minutes.

17
00:02:05,324 --> 00:02:08,812
Scott: It's not even for a 12 year old for anyone no matter their age.

18
00:02:09,054 --> 00:02:10,878
Scott: This is some amazing freaking drumming.

19
00:02:11,803 --> 00:02:19,179
Scott: Now I'm not an expert drummer or an expert on drum playing But I don't think you have to be to recognize how awesome this drumming is.

20
00:02:20,021 --> 00:02:24,420
Scott: And then when you add that to the fact that he's 12 years old, it's just even more awesome.

21
00:02:25,742 --> 00:02:35,098
Scott: Now first I thought maybe he was the you know One of those kids where the parents took him since the age of zero and made him do this thing and he has no social Skills and he's a loser and whatever.

22
00:02:36,202 --> 00:02:42,539
Scott: But if you watch the video and you hear him talk at the beginning He seems like he's a cool happening kid who knows the score and is you know?

23
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,953
Scott: Intelligent like someone you want to hang out with it.

24
00:02:45,858 --> 00:02:54,219
Scott: So watch it and enjoy and now listen to the Podcast that we recorded many days ago.

25
00:03:00,802 --> 00:03:09,919
Rym: Alright, so today we're going to conclude our little series on how to attend conventions with the final bits and then some nice regular closing advice.

26
00:03:11,082 --> 00:03:22,425
Rym: So like we said last time we're gonna cover the artists alley the dance slash rave because every con seems to have a different kind of dance and some are scary and You really got to know where you're getting into.

27
00:03:22,445 --> 00:03:29,399
Rym: and Also, we want to yell you to make sure you don't end up being that glow stick waving smelly fanboy That's always in my way when I'm trying to dance.

28
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,424
Scott: if you're that guy.

29
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:33,301
Scott: Oh my god I'm coming to get you.

30
00:03:33,664 --> 00:03:39,443
Rym: Yeah Drama drama con because there's no drama involved with our grooms.

31
00:03:39,624 --> 00:03:51,170
Rym: ever since one convention the first Otakon We went to where a couple people in our room had some issues and ended up having some drama We basically we did all the drama out and while we're friends with people who cause drama.

32
00:03:51,572 --> 00:03:54,287
Rym: They are not allowed to stay with us at conventions, which makes our life.

33
00:03:54,488 --> 00:03:54,750
Rym: Awesome.

34
00:03:56,211 --> 00:04:01,930
Rym: And then leaving the convention because leaving is actually a fine art and if you fail at it, you'll ruin your whole Sunday.

35
00:04:02,613 --> 00:04:14,900
Scott: yeah, leaving is yeah, it can be harder than arriving actually and Basically the longer it takes you to leave and the more you fuck up leaving The less time you have at the final day of the convention

36
00:04:15,081 --> 00:04:24,227
Rym: because we stayed up way too late Saturday night at the last Otakon and we fucked up leaving in the morning and we basically missed a bunch of stuff and it was horrible.

37
00:04:24,588 --> 00:04:27,803
Scott: It wasn't horrible Yeah, yeah.

38
00:04:28,631 --> 00:04:37,530
Rym: So artist allies now for any of you haven't been to a convention and this is really true of anime and gaming conventions Especially comic conventions also have big artists allies.

39
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,156
Rym: I've never actually been to a comic convention.

40
00:04:39,537 --> 00:05:07,069
Scott: a comic convention is sort of like an anime convention because has the artist alley which is almost the same thing and it has the panels and it has but it doesn't have like the big events like concerts and dances and things and Instead of having like, you know a dealers room and then everything else separate It's pretty much this giant room where this is booths and every booth is Either a dealer or a comic guy or both.

41
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:08,933
Scott: And you just you.

42
00:05:08,973 --> 00:05:17,768
Scott: basically at a comic convention you walk around to all the booths and the booths are kind of like the expensive Ones for people with money and the artists alley is where the poor people are.

43
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:24,209
Rym: But at most conventions basically all the artists alley is is you'll see the dealers room and that's where all the professional stuff is.

44
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:26,927
Rym: Costs a lot of money to be in there and everyone's trying to make money.

45
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:32,605
Rym: artist alleys tend to be Anyone who ponies up some paltry amount of money.

46
00:05:32,645 --> 00:05:39,297
Rym: or sometimes it's just free And they get a little space on the table and they can do whatever they want with that space As long as it follows certain rules.

47
00:05:39,377 --> 00:05:47,383
Scott: and usually they just present their art and try to get people to like their art And maybe get a few commissions sell a few little pictures or something.

48
00:05:47,965 --> 00:05:49,290
Scott: Maybe some arts and crafts.

49
00:05:50,011 --> 00:05:53,410
Rym: Now at small conventions just go and have fun and don't even try to make money.

50
00:05:53,571 --> 00:05:56,204
Rym: You might make money, but it's really not the primary focus.

51
00:05:56,244 --> 00:05:57,249
Rym: It's just artists hanging out.

52
00:05:58,134 --> 00:06:04,369
Rym: but if you go to a big convention like Otakon or Anime Central There are people who make big money.

53
00:06:04,902 --> 00:06:14,170
Rym: Yeah like we have friends who make a lot of money sitting in the in the artist alley all day for like the whole convention just Selling their art or doing commissions or making stickers.

54
00:06:15,172 --> 00:06:17,669
Scott: It's actually pretty awesome that you know someone who?

55
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:23,010
Scott: Doesn't get much coverage and you know, they they have really good art skills.

56
00:06:23,211 --> 00:06:26,249
Scott: But you know, no one pays attention to them and they're not well known.

57
00:06:26,792 --> 00:06:30,590
Scott: You just sit in this room all day and people will notice them and then pay them a lot of money.

58
00:06:31,512 --> 00:06:35,110
Rym: I mean honestly, I used to go to the dealers room and I was like my big thing.

59
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:43,821
Rym: But as I've been to more conventions and I've seen every little anime gadget gizmo Plushie you can buy and I've got all the ones I want.

60
00:06:44,463 --> 00:06:46,050
Rym: I don't buy so much in the dealers room anymore.

61
00:06:46,653 --> 00:06:54,170
Rym: I spent almost all my money in artists alley buying either Commissioning things or buying little prints or buying the originals if I can and bidding on art.

62
00:06:54,631 --> 00:06:59,446
Scott: Yeah, I mean artists alley used to be like I'm not really too keen on that whatever.

63
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:11,259
Scott: I wasn't too interested in it You know and the dealers room was like, oh, yeah, look at this stuff all this stuff I can't get in America my little, you know action figure you guys and Model kits and all kinds of cool stuff, right?

64
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:15,270
Scott: But then eventually they don't make so much new stuff.

65
00:07:15,371 --> 00:07:23,650
Scott: So like once you've been to the dealers room Especially the Otakon one or you go to online and you look in dealers, you know dealers websites.

66
00:07:24,692 --> 00:07:28,950
Scott: You eventually see everything there is and there isn't too much new amazing stuff.

67
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:37,122
Scott: It's just like more of the same and once you find the more of the same that you want and buy it all you're pretty Much like alright unless there's a rare gem in here somewhere.

68
00:07:37,142 --> 00:07:39,050
Scott: I don't care but an artist alley.

69
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:47,458
Scott: There's all kinds of people who think like you and are making the things that you know You wish they made officially but they don't.

70
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:51,230
Rym: I mean you'll see a lot of just unique stuff.

71
00:07:51,612 --> 00:07:56,696
Rym: However, the first thing that really made us realize how awesome it was is way back I think was our first Otakon.

72
00:07:57,198 --> 00:07:59,690
Rym: We I saw this little that little print for sale.

73
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:15,250
Rym: Yeah, super Mario Super Show Joe Brothers and it was all the characters from shoujo kakameo Tena dressed up as characters from Mario Brothers And I realized that there are infinite possibilities in the genre of something dressed up like something else.

74
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:20,327
Scott: Yeah, but you realize that that's just also in the realm of scary fanfic and whatever.

75
00:08:20,347 --> 00:08:24,705
Scott: Yeah It's it's weird because if it's a scary fanfic, I'll be like, that's just a scary fanfic.

76
00:08:24,726 --> 00:08:25,549
Scott: get that the hell away from me.

77
00:08:26,091 --> 00:08:30,390
Scott: But if someone draws a really cute picture it all depends on the quality of their drawing.

78
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:37,655
Scott: Like if they draw it really crappily, I'll be like that's a scary fanfic picture, but if they draw it really amazingly It's like holy crap.

79
00:08:37,674 --> 00:08:40,044
Scott: Someone needs to scan that and put it all over the internet stat.

80
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,013
Rym: I Mean, what was it?

81
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:43,142
Rym: We saw this year that we really?

82
00:08:43,243 --> 00:08:43,625
Rym: Oh, right.

83
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,795
Rym: It was Princess peach.

84
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:46,663
Scott: that was last year.

85
00:08:46,703 --> 00:08:47,430
Rym: I think that was last year.

86
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:52,358
Rym: Well last year there was a big one and this year there were the prints and I got a little print Yeah, and you got that freedom Gundam whatever.

87
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,607
Rym: Yeah, I gotta figure out where I put those.

88
00:08:54,647 --> 00:08:55,330
Rym: we can get him framed.

89
00:08:55,571 --> 00:08:57,198
Scott: I think they're on your desk somewhere or something.

90
00:08:57,238 --> 00:08:59,387
Rym: Yeah, I put them somewhere safe and I'm not sure where I put him.

91
00:08:59,608 --> 00:09:01,413
Rym: good job Yeah, I'll dig him up.

92
00:09:01,934 --> 00:09:10,357
Scott: Yeah, but it was like Princess Peach with like crazy armor sitting on a Yoshi With like this crazy umbrella.

93
00:09:10,377 --> 00:09:17,500
Scott: It was just an amazing amazing picture that like anyone who likes Mario would like kill to have on their wall.

94
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,387
Rym: I Way back there's only one for sale.

95
00:09:22,871 --> 00:09:27,815
Rym: It was in the auction it went for some crazy amount of money and the guy was like I can't believe that was popular.

96
00:09:28,056 --> 00:09:31,588
Rym: So we came back selling prints of it and he sold like all of them right away.

97
00:09:31,608 --> 00:09:35,561
Scott: Yep I mean if you do something good, you'll make a killing.

98
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:42,670
Scott: All right, so to get into artists alley Basically, you just go to the website for whatever convention you're going to and read the instructions.

99
00:09:43,691 --> 00:09:48,370
Scott: Read the instructions very carefully and do it early as early as possible.

100
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:52,885
Rym: I mean Otakons artist alley sold out within an hour of going live.

101
00:09:53,106 --> 00:10:00,250
Scott: Yeah, that's only Otakon though Other cons should be okay But like a medium-sized con you might have a little trouble if you wait till the last minute.

102
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:03,710
Scott: So as soon as you decide you're definitely going to the convention.

103
00:10:04,991 --> 00:10:06,417
Scott: follow the artist alley instructions.

104
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:17,699
Scott: if you have to like call someone or email the people at the convention or something to make sure you've done it right and Maybe confirm a couple times just to make sure 100%.

105
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:30,182
Rym: Yeah cuz there are often a lot of stupid legal things you have to deal with in an artist alley because like Marilyn for one has all these laws about vending and you have to apply for a vendors permit before otherwise The police will literally come bust you up.

106
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,801
Rym: Mm-hmm Some states are more lax.

107
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:33,990
Rym: just find out whatever the rules are.

108
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,539
Rym: The convention will tell you and just do them.

109
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:40,809
Rym: if you're under 18 You might have a lot of trouble and there's really nothing that can be done about that.

110
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:46,488
Scott: Under 18 just don't bother or you know, just hang out in artist alley or find someone who's.

111
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:47,190
Scott: you know.

112
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:55,195
Scott: usually if there's someone who's over 18 and They have a table and you can make friends with them or they are your friend already and you just sit with them or they Let you sit with them.

113
00:10:55,235 --> 00:10:57,909
Scott: No one will notice or care, you know, something like that.

114
00:10:58,211 --> 00:11:06,090
Rym: I mean my main advice if you're gonna sit in artist alley is one Get a bunch of friends with you because then it's it's just fun to hang out there all day with all your friends doing art.

115
00:11:06,391 --> 00:11:13,286
Scott: Yeah, what really sucks about artist alley is you don't want to end up sitting there all day and all night and not enjoying The rest of the convention at all.

116
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:21,790
Scott: You need to have some sort of rotation with people where you get up and you sit down And you do have an easy way to get your stuff in and out of there because you don't want to leave it.

117
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,870
Scott: They're unattended because they'll just be stolen or destroyed or something.

118
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:25,793
Rym: I highly recommend.

119
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,779
Rym: you share an artist alley table with a friend.

120
00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:32,431
Rym: It makes the experience much more enjoyable like infinitely Alright.

121
00:11:32,813 --> 00:11:40,270
Scott: the second thing you got to do is you got to figure out what you're gonna do with the artist alley table and I recommend there are two ways you can go about it.

122
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:45,510
Scott: If you're like a super artist, you pretty much just have to display your art and people will come and patronize you.

123
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:47,275
Scott: It's that easy now.

124
00:11:47,336 --> 00:11:49,041
Rym: It depends on what you want by patronize.

125
00:11:49,462 --> 00:11:50,345
Rym: Do you want to sell prints?

126
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:51,790
Rym: Do you want to sell originals?

127
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:55,341
Rym: Do you want to generate buzz for your online webcomic project?

128
00:11:55,903 --> 00:11:57,789
Rym: Do you want to get people to commission you?

129
00:11:58,691 --> 00:12:03,686
Rym: That's that's one of the primary Motive forces and artists alleys these days is people seeking commissions.

130
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:14,709
Scott: Yep Of course if you want to make lots of money You're not pretty much gonna have to Face the the truth and you're not gonna be able to do what you want to do and what you like to do.

131
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:25,604
Rym: if you Want to make lots of money you're gonna have to pander to the fans and the fans want something that's cute and relatively cheap That can be produced in mass quantity that no one else is offering.

132
00:12:25,804 --> 00:12:26,829
Scott: Yeah, it has to be unique.

133
00:12:27,633 --> 00:12:33,914
Scott: So let's say there's a super new anime called Amazing crazy whatnot?

134
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:49,530
Scott: show and there's a cute animal in the show, but there are no plushies of that animal and everyone in the show wears These special sunglasses and those sunglasses are not available for purchase or they're very expensive in the dealers room for the official ones.

135
00:12:49,891 --> 00:12:55,770
Rym: If you can make those sunglasses, even if they're kind of crappy if they're just good enough, you'll sell all of them immediately

136
00:12:56,051 --> 00:13:06,123
Scott: Mm-hmm, and you know you make a plushie of that cute little animal or you make like a hat that looks like the animal or A car or anything pictures of the animal.

137
00:13:06,384 --> 00:13:07,530
Scott: you'll be freaking sold.

138
00:13:08,172 --> 00:13:12,507
Rym: I mean like the year right after FMA came out and was really popular.

139
00:13:12,527 --> 00:13:13,470
Rym: and then Otakon happened.

140
00:13:13,851 --> 00:13:20,167
Rym: There was almost no full metal alchemist merchandise in the in the dealers room just because it hadn't gotten over to the US yet.

141
00:13:20,548 --> 00:13:22,721
Rym: Mm-hmm and The artists alley.

142
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:29,648
Rym: a few people Realized this and came with a pile of like full metal alchemist buttons and stickers and they sold.

143
00:13:29,668 --> 00:13:30,410
Rym: I think they sold them all.

144
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:32,039
Rym: I still have my huge sticker.

145
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:33,849
Scott: Yeah, I got a little huge pin.

146
00:13:34,332 --> 00:13:36,630
Scott: I have an official huge pin and I have a huge sticker.

147
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,474
Scott: That's really cute.

148
00:13:37,554 --> 00:13:41,010
Scott: stickers go well if you have cute pictures on them that no one else has.

149
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:45,347
Rym: Yeah, stickers are key, especially stickers that easily fit on someone's con badge.

150
00:13:45,568 --> 00:13:47,890
Scott: Mm-hmm I remember what was big in the dealers room.

151
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:52,450
Scott: I was looking for Death Note stuff because Death Note was not highly merchandised in the dealer room.

152
00:13:52,611 --> 00:13:54,821
Scott: So pretty much anything with Death Note on it.

153
00:13:54,882 --> 00:13:55,866
Scott: that was in artists alley.

154
00:13:55,907 --> 00:13:56,429
Scott: I just picked up.

155
00:13:58,252 --> 00:14:01,009
Rym: It's hard to say what's gonna be the big thing this year.

156
00:14:01,351 --> 00:14:06,650
Rym: Yeah, I mean I think Death Note is gonna be past its prime in the sense that a lot of people are gonna be doing It.

157
00:14:07,011 --> 00:14:18,809
Scott: yeah, but at this it's gonna be huge though because the manga is actually out in English now true as opposed to just other Languages and so now all the other people have picked up on it and it sold quite well.

158
00:14:19,413 --> 00:14:27,010
Rym: Yeah, cuz back at Katsucon last year There were two Death Note items of art in the entire convention in the auction and I bid on them and lost.

159
00:14:27,593 --> 00:14:30,189
Rym: Well, yeah that anecdote didn't go anywhere.

160
00:14:32,374 --> 00:14:36,813
Rym: No, I didn't like meet the artist and then like she tried to kill me or anything cool I just lost.

161
00:14:37,315 --> 00:14:40,445
Scott: now if you're an artist alley visitor, it's a little different.

162
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:40,787
Scott: Basically.

163
00:14:40,807 --> 00:14:46,170
Scott: What you want to do is You want to go there as soon as it officially opens.

164
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:50,790
Scott: But you want if you do that, they're not all the artists will be set up yet because they're mostly lazy.

165
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:52,399
Scott: But you still want to do that.

166
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:56,642
Scott: in case anyone sets up something crazy That's gonna sell out like, you know crazy gonna.

167
00:14:56,663 --> 00:15:00,129
Rym: it's basically just kind of walk into the room Give a scan make sure there's nothing weird going on.

168
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:07,976
Scott: Yeah, if you see something like a crowd of people throwing money around whatever that is It's it's 90% chance.

169
00:15:08,016 --> 00:15:09,181
Scott: It's awesome and you want it.

170
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:11,710
Scott: so you better run over there and fight with the best of them.

171
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:20,990
Scott: but then you want to come back like at least once a day and Check everything because artists rotate in and out and there'll be something different every freaking time.

172
00:15:21,612 --> 00:15:26,090
Scott: And this is a really tiny con in which case, you know, you'll pretty much see everything in one go.

173
00:15:27,011 --> 00:15:32,430
Scott: But if it's any even the medium-sized cons now have respectable artists alleys that you have to visit multiple times.

174
00:15:32,671 --> 00:15:35,210
Rym: Yeah, the one kind of doesn't surprisingly is anime Expo.

175
00:15:35,616 --> 00:15:45,006
Rym: We've never been to it But from all my friends who have gone or told me about it their artist alley unless it's changed very recently Is like a hole in the wall under a stairway in the back middle of nowhere.

176
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:48,525
Scott: Well That's kind of surprising.

177
00:15:48,787 --> 00:15:58,326
Rym: Yeah well anime expo is very much a business side oriented convention and Otakon is definitely a Fan oriented convention and that's why it is to win fair.

178
00:16:01,671 --> 00:16:12,690
Rym: now a lot of people give commissions or they try to sell commissions in artist alley and Basically, if you're not really familiar with the concept It means you go to an artist who style you like and you ask them to draw you something and they tell you how much?

179
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:16,230
Rym: It'll cost to do that and they'll either mail it to you or you can pick it up at the end of the con.

180
00:16:16,502 --> 00:16:17,573
Scott: Yep You can get like.

181
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:34,470
Scott: you can ask for anything from like a two minute like a two second sketch like just sketch it real quick And it'd be like a few dollars to draw me a giant thing in full color or make me a tapestry which will cost you From hunt, you know, maybe 50 bucks to a hundred to thousands of dollars depending on the artist and all kinds of stuff.

182
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:41,610
Rym: Yeah there's this guy who makes these awesome anime like tapestries and It'd be a couple thousand dollars for what I want.

183
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:45,410
Rym: But I'd like to commission like this giant utenna tapestry and just hang it in our kitchen.

184
00:16:46,011 --> 00:16:50,500
Rym: Yeah, great mainly to cut down on the echo in there that rooms too big and has too little in it.

185
00:16:51,531 --> 00:16:52,495
Scott: Get some stuff to put in it.

186
00:16:52,696 --> 00:16:54,263
Rym: We got one FMA wall scroll.

187
00:16:54,303 --> 00:16:55,970
Rym: I don't think it's dampening the sound so much.

188
00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:01,370
Scott: Yeah, we'll get something else, but I don't think a giant thousand dollar tapestry is but most economical decision.

189
00:17:01,611 --> 00:17:02,796
Rym: I have two basic warnings.

190
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:12,210
Rym: if you're if you're doing commissions for other people Be warned that at least half the people who come up to you will probably ask for something horrible and pornographic.

191
00:17:12,853 --> 00:17:15,684
Scott: Now if you don't mind drawing that you'll make a ton.

192
00:17:16,046 --> 00:17:26,369
Scott: Yeah way to go but I Wouldn't draw that if I was an artist, you know, so yes guys you guys got to say no It depends on your level of scruples.

193
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:30,367
Rym: But don't be afraid to say no not even if it's porn if it's something that you don't think you can do.

194
00:17:30,448 --> 00:17:33,920
Rym: something is too Ambitious or you won't have time for just don't be afraid to say no.

195
00:17:34,282 --> 00:17:37,779
Rym: more people will come and they expect that because That's what happens.

196
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,889
Rym: Not everyone can do everything.

197
00:17:39,512 --> 00:17:46,177
Scott: Another good strategy is if you're a really good artist you can just say oh you want something porn double price Yep, you know.

198
00:17:46,217 --> 00:17:47,002
Scott: and those fanboys.

199
00:17:47,022 --> 00:17:47,465
Scott: They're freaky.

200
00:17:47,485 --> 00:17:47,908
Scott: They'll pay it?

201
00:17:48,571 --> 00:17:50,398
Rym: Yeah, and yeah, they really will.

202
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:55,198
Scott: and if you don't you know and you can get away with drawing it a little shitty You know and what do you care?

203
00:17:55,219 --> 00:17:56,305
Scott: It's just a porn thing.

204
00:17:56,325 --> 00:18:02,190
Scott: Don't put your name on it No one will know, you know, they'll be like, oh that's shitty, you know, it doesn't look like they drew it whatever.

205
00:18:03,532 --> 00:18:10,149
Rym: now if you want a commission for yourself from an artist a Lot of people don't seem to realize that you actually have to put a little bit of thought in it.

206
00:18:10,572 --> 00:18:14,377
Rym: If you just walk up and say draw me a giant robot Doing something awesome.

207
00:18:15,082 --> 00:18:16,330
Rym: That's really not enough input.

208
00:18:16,951 --> 00:18:20,370
Rym: Yeah, you have to start like hate that some some people like to run with it.

209
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,378
Rym: But most artists I've known hate it.

210
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:25,610
Rym: if you ask for a commission or a sketch and then you really don't give them any idea.

211
00:18:26,132 --> 00:18:35,850
Rym: Mm-hmm, like if you want them to draw your Dungeons & Dragons character dressed up as a la card from housing You better have a good explanation of what your character looks like or you're not gonna be happy with the result.

212
00:18:36,455 --> 00:18:41,727
Scott: Yeah the thing is if someone's your friend like you know them then they kind of know what you like.

213
00:18:41,907 --> 00:18:43,779
Scott: or if you just tell an Artist draw whatever you want.

214
00:18:43,819 --> 00:18:45,009
Scott: They'll draw whatever they want.

215
00:18:45,331 --> 00:18:55,457
Rym: Yeah, my friggin artist friends if they know that if they draw like an air pirate in the sky Doing something awesome and some sort of steampunk era I'll just go nuts over it.

216
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,540
Scott: Yeah, but if it's some if it's an artist You don't know and you just walk around.

217
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,835
Scott: you see their style is awesome You know.

218
00:19:00,895 --> 00:19:18,023
Scott: tell them I want you to draw a pirate posing like this and do a pose and then be like wearing you know an eyepatch and a peg leg and they're standing on a ship and it's real windy and There's a crazy weird cutesy animal flying around, you know, that looks like this.

219
00:19:18,885 --> 00:19:20,250
Scott: That's about a good enough description.

220
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:23,812
Scott: I Know you can't just be like I want a pirate Cuz.

221
00:19:23,832 --> 00:19:26,627
Scott: they'll just draw like a little stick figure with an eyepatch and give you a finger.

222
00:19:27,695 --> 00:19:28,281
Scott: at least they should.

223
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:32,347
Rym: I Mean, I guess we could talk about artists alley forever just because we love it.

224
00:19:32,628 --> 00:19:34,256
Scott: Oh, yeah It's not all about artists alley is it?

225
00:19:34,437 --> 00:19:34,919
Rym: No, it's not.

226
00:19:34,979 --> 00:19:37,410
Rym: but check out artists alleys go to a convention.

227
00:19:37,731 --> 00:19:40,001
Rym: They're an experience that you can't really describe.

228
00:19:40,021 --> 00:19:40,845
Rym: You just have to see it.

229
00:19:41,206 --> 00:19:46,527
Rym: Yep now The dance or the rave or whatever you want to call it.

230
00:19:46,547 --> 00:19:48,795
Rym: Wow Now I'm going to.

231
00:19:49,237 --> 00:19:57,407
Rym: we might make some enemies here because we have basically there are two camps When it comes to dances at conventions and these two camps are split about 50/50.

232
00:19:57,407 --> 00:20:00,278
Scott: and well There is a third camp which I can I can talk about.

233
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:00,720
Rym: Oh, yeah.

234
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:00,961
Rym: Yeah.

235
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:02,246
Rym: Yeah, but they're not.

236
00:20:02,346 --> 00:20:03,993
Scott: they're not in the same third Camp I'm thinking of.

237
00:20:04,715 --> 00:20:05,819
Rym: I might be I don't know.

238
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:06,822
Scott: I don't think you are.

239
00:20:07,023 --> 00:20:07,464
Rym: We'll see.

240
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:07,986
Scott: We'll see.

241
00:20:08,528 --> 00:20:26,689
Rym: but basically There are the people who want dance rave music and there are people who want to dance to anime music Or your Japanese music in general and there seem to be two unique separate subcultures dedicated to these two types of dancing at cons and every con handles it differently.

242
00:20:26,709 --> 00:20:40,785
Rym: and I guess in my opinion Katsucon has the best dance of any convention on the East Coast Because they definitely cater to the kind of dance I like and they know who's going to their con.

243
00:20:41,247 --> 00:20:56,070
Rym: on Friday last year They played 80s music like bad 80s music from my childhood Scary and it was me and all my friends who all grew up in the 80s Dancing with other geeks who also grew up in the 80s at an anime con and it was fantastic.

244
00:20:57,113 --> 00:21:00,097
Rym: It included the ninja rap for it.

245
00:21:00,318 --> 00:21:12,093
Rym: Wow, and then Saturday They played a lot of OC remixes a lot of anime music with bass beats added You could dance to it a lot of para para max type stuff and they had big Projectors like.

246
00:21:12,133 --> 00:21:20,723
Rym: they played River City Ransom stuff that you could dance to and they had projectors with two staff guys playing River City Ransom Fighting each other in time with the music.

247
00:21:21,206 --> 00:21:21,970
Scott: Did he get the lead pipe?

248
00:21:23,432 --> 00:21:24,198
Rym: I actually don't remember.

249
00:21:24,218 --> 00:21:25,850
Rym: I was too busy dancing.

250
00:21:26,574 --> 00:21:27,387
Scott: Yeah, that would do it.

251
00:21:27,612 --> 00:21:36,735
Rym: Yeah And watching my poor friend who's true who met this cute girl and they're like dancing with each other and then our scary friend Scared her away.

252
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:38,220
Scott: It always seems to happen.

253
00:21:38,501 --> 00:21:38,742
Rym: It was.

254
00:21:39,404 --> 00:21:44,550
Rym: I'll describe that story someday But basically it was the biggest cock block in the history of the world.

255
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:47,200
Scott: I've seen bigger cock block.

256
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:47,944
Rym: I this story.

257
00:21:47,964 --> 00:21:51,723
Rym: if I tell this story in detail I think you will agree that this is the biggest cock block in the world.

258
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:56,145
Rym: when a scary man Runs up and tries to headbutt the girl you're trying to split with.

259
00:21:56,165 --> 00:21:57,030
Rym: that's the end.

260
00:21:58,512 --> 00:22:00,588
Scott: Yeah, it is but I've heard worse.

261
00:22:02,373 --> 00:22:03,789
Scott: Believe me I actually have heard worse.

262
00:22:04,811 --> 00:22:09,030
Rym: Now Otakon seems to definitely tend to more more toward the rave aspects.

263
00:22:09,593 --> 00:22:12,830
Scott: Yeah, well you thing is if it's not an anime convention, you know.

264
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:18,690
Scott: If it's any other kind of convention and they have some dance of some sort, you know, it's just rave is what you do.

265
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:19,172
Scott: There's not.

266
00:22:19,372 --> 00:22:22,825
Scott: you know other conventions don't have a type of music associated with them.

267
00:22:22,946 --> 00:22:26,704
Scott: Yeah, you can't really play D&D music at a gaming convention.

268
00:22:26,744 --> 00:22:27,509
Scott: It just doesn't you know.

269
00:22:27,771 --> 00:22:28,273
Rym: I mean we went.

270
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:41,729
Rym: I went to or we all went to a penguin con a Linux convention in Michigan and They had a dance and they played mostly 80s music that we'd recognize And like the time warp and all that freaky stuff that people at those kind of cons like to dance to.

271
00:22:42,893 --> 00:22:45,349
Scott: But it wasn't like they could play Linux music.

272
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:47,625
Rym: They could play DCSS.

273
00:22:48,712 --> 00:22:54,187
Scott: I guess they could but that's not very dancing if you know what I mean the hell right paren right paren.

274
00:22:54,508 --> 00:22:54,708
Scott: Yeah.

275
00:22:54,728 --> 00:22:57,535
Scott: Yeah, so But an anime conventions.

276
00:22:57,595 --> 00:23:03,093
Scott: they can play anime music if they want and that's what we prefer because you know What's the point.

277
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:14,476
Scott: I can go if I want to go to a rave I can go to a rave out anywhere Anytime, you know I'm coming to this convention is because it's it's about anime and I like anime and I like anime music And that's what I want to.

278
00:23:14,556 --> 00:23:22,510
Scott: you know dance to and I know that you know It'll be easier to find cool people if they're also dancing to that because that's what cool people will do if you have a rave.

279
00:23:22,711 --> 00:23:26,529
Scott: That's what drags in all kinds of ne'er-do-wells and such.

280
00:23:27,132 --> 00:23:36,590
Rym: Yeah, well part of the problem with I guess very large conventions is that the dance is pretty much an unmitigated Disaster in terms of maintenance planning and security.

281
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:50,130
Rym: There's just no way to actually police it and there's just crazy people running around swinging Joe's dark glow sticks around on sticks or strings and People just like laying in the back asleep getting stepped on or people to stand in the middle of dance floor not even dancing.

282
00:23:51,051 --> 00:23:54,947
Scott: Yeah, I hate when dancers gets you crowd and you can't do anything except bounce up and down.

283
00:23:55,007 --> 00:23:56,293
Scott: That's just like alright I'm out of here.

284
00:23:56,434 --> 00:24:05,250
Rym: see I'm fine with a really crowded dance floor if everyone's actually dancing But when it's ten people standing in a circle or God circles, don't even get me started on circles.

285
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:10,134
Scott: Yeah One guy who can like do a backflip is in the middle of the circle just backflipping Repeatedly will?

286
00:24:10,174 --> 00:24:20,010
Rym: everyone stands around in a circle just kind of shimmying Just watching the guy ask any professional DJ or professional lighting dude for a cop for any sort of dance club.

287
00:24:20,611 --> 00:24:22,578
Rym: Circles are the end of your dance.

288
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:29,569
Rym: if circles are forming it means you fucked up and the music is not danceable Or the people at your dance just suck.

289
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:31,990
Scott: It is usually the people sucking.

290
00:24:32,372 --> 00:24:39,622
Rym: I mean there's nothing wrong with someone showing off their bad b-boy skills But not in the middle of the dance floor preventing all of us who are trying to actually dance.

291
00:24:40,143 --> 00:24:47,655
Scott: Yeah, that's agreed, but the key to succeeding at a dance is Don't don't worry about your eyes.

292
00:24:48,137 --> 00:24:49,140
Scott: Don't worry about your ears.

293
00:24:49,802 --> 00:24:50,664
Scott: We're about your nose.

294
00:24:51,627 --> 00:24:54,708
Scott: if you smells bad Move your feet to somewhere else.

295
00:24:55,632 --> 00:25:00,624
Rym: Good God, you can smell Otakon's dance from halfway across the convention center.

296
00:25:01,446 --> 00:25:05,594
Scott: It's really nasty like The guys who are swinging the glow sticks.

297
00:25:06,396 --> 00:25:11,501
Scott: Yeah, they should put some deodorant in them glow sticks and then Crack them open and pour them on the pits.

298
00:25:11,662 --> 00:25:12,929
Scott: cuz god damn.

299
00:25:14,171 --> 00:25:23,770
Scott: you know these people who didn't shower since the morning or possibly the previous day and They're basically non-stop moving their bodies sweating all over the place.

300
00:25:24,151 --> 00:25:29,370
Scott: They're not stopping and there's a whole bunch of them in a really crowded room with poor ventilation.

301
00:25:30,892 --> 00:25:32,299
Rym: Now don't let that dissuade you.

302
00:25:32,881 --> 00:25:40,470
Rym: maybe it'll dissuade you from Otakon's dance But in general con dances even if you're kind of shy or you're afraid of dancing or you think you look silly.

303
00:25:41,074 --> 00:25:41,578
Rym: Oh my god.

304
00:25:41,598 --> 00:25:42,645
Rym: Go you'll have an amazing time.

305
00:25:42,907 --> 00:25:48,130
Scott: Yeah If the only reason you're not dancing is you think you'll look silly just look around.

306
00:25:48,511 --> 00:25:53,710
Scott: Yeah, not like a nightclub where you know people kind of know how to dance or they pretend to.

307
00:25:54,491 --> 00:25:55,173
Scott: You know, whatever.

308
00:25:55,193 --> 00:25:56,798
Scott: This is a bunch of nerds.

309
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,263
Scott: They all look silly.

310
00:25:58,564 --> 00:25:59,367
Scott: No one cares.

311
00:25:59,447 --> 00:26:01,388
Scott: No one's looking at you You know.

312
00:26:01,611 --> 00:26:01,952
Rym: And I see.

313
00:26:01,992 --> 00:26:07,474
Rym: you see that bad b-boy in the middle of a circle and he looks like he's doing something crazy and complex with A Joe stick jar up up.

314
00:26:07,555 --> 00:26:08,658
Rym: Why don't keep saying Joe stick?

315
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,481
Scott: I don't know.

316
00:26:09,522 --> 00:26:11,087
Rym: because Oh because of Tokyo Joe.

317
00:26:11,107 --> 00:26:13,356
Rym: All right Yeah, that's what we used to call those types.

318
00:26:13,536 --> 00:26:18,116
Rym: Yeah, but they got a glow stick and they're doing something crazy with it And it looks really awesome.

319
00:26:18,317 --> 00:26:26,030
Rym: No, it's not if if you turn the strobe light off He's just kind of moving his hand around in a circle and it's something anyone can do with them with zero practice.

320
00:26:26,871 --> 00:26:28,716
Scott: Yeah, don't be intimidated.

321
00:26:29,016 --> 00:26:33,810
Rym: That's the key cuz go in flail your arms meet a cute girl or cute guy and just dance with him.

322
00:26:34,151 --> 00:26:41,860
Scott: Yep, and trust me anyone there who's not already dancing with someone wants to dance with someone Yes of the opposite sex.

323
00:26:42,161 --> 00:26:45,560
Scott: and if they don't want to dance with the opposite sex They'll just tell you because gay people are cool like that.

324
00:26:45,982 --> 00:26:50,402
Rym: Yeah anime cons are Great places to meet compatible people.

325
00:26:50,422 --> 00:27:00,130
Rym: if you're a geek and You're at a con and you see a cute girl go over there dance with her play DDR with her or something.

326
00:27:00,732 --> 00:27:03,886
Scott: The real key is just to have social skills because or and not smell.

327
00:27:04,167 --> 00:27:09,950
Scott: if you don't smell You're not ugly and you have any amount of social grace any amount at all?

328
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:13,381
Scott: of course, you know, I guess that's sort of false because you either have grace or you don't.

329
00:27:13,421 --> 00:27:18,678
Rym: but I Have grace I don't want grace.

330
00:27:18,698 --> 00:27:28,230
Scott: Yeah, anyway, but if you have any social skills whatsoever You know and there's a common interest duh, you're at the same convention about the same thing.

331
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:37,690
Rym: There's already a common interest cuz that's the first like barrier most shy people seem to have over actually getting up the nuts to go Ask a girl out or do you want to dance with me and girls too?

332
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,036
Rym: I'm just using the guy example.

333
00:27:39,096 --> 00:27:39,760
Rym: cuz I'm a guy.

334
00:27:40,403 --> 00:27:41,650
Rym: is that you know, what do I say?

335
00:27:42,133 --> 00:27:43,080
Rym: It's an anime con.

336
00:27:43,422 --> 00:27:44,510
Rym: talk about how much you hate Shinji.

337
00:27:44,972 --> 00:27:46,698
Rym: Yeah, you've all seen the same shows.

338
00:27:46,859 --> 00:27:48,645
Scott: or hey, they're playing this great anime song.

339
00:27:48,665 --> 00:27:53,070
Scott: go up and be like, dude I love this song blah blah blah blah blah and start singing it.

340
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,135
Scott: Maybe they'll start singing it.

341
00:27:54,155 --> 00:27:56,767
Scott: cuz trust me girls anime cons love to sing songs.

342
00:27:57,129 --> 00:27:58,155
Rym: Yeah I mean God.

343
00:27:58,175 --> 00:28:00,470
Rym: we used to run dances or anime music nights.

344
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:06,640
Rym: We call them at our club at RIT and whenever we play that frickin Inuyasha song I want to change the world.

345
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,827
Scott: that's an Inuyasha song.

346
00:28:08,048 --> 00:28:12,982
Rym: Yeah Frickin the girls there would scream it at the top of their lungs.

347
00:28:13,563 --> 00:28:14,506
Scott: if you sing it with them.

348
00:28:14,907 --> 00:28:15,649
Scott: They will like you.

349
00:28:15,931 --> 00:28:18,108
Scott: Yes, they will like you as long as you don't sing it like.

350
00:28:21,432 --> 00:28:22,135
Scott: How is that?

351
00:28:22,376 --> 00:28:24,546
Scott: I tried to make a painful noise without making it loud.

352
00:28:24,586 --> 00:28:25,550
Rym: you just sounded like the cheat.

353
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,777
Scott: Yeah, yeah the cheat.

354
00:28:30,817 --> 00:28:40,630
Scott: he can totally rock the house with his switchlight raves light switch raves, yeah, so After you're done with the dance and you go back to your room and take a shower.

355
00:28:41,391 --> 00:28:51,116
Rym: you got to worry about how to leave the convention on Sunday, yes, and Basically, this is very critical in the sense that if you do not do it Like I said earlier and you do not do it.

356
00:28:51,156 --> 00:28:52,702
Rym: Well, you will lose your Sunday.

357
00:28:53,104 --> 00:28:54,590
Scott: Now Sunday is an important con day.

358
00:28:54,671 --> 00:29:07,228
Scott: This is the last day for the dealers room Which is when they'll be mad sales Because dealers will be trying to get rid of all their stuff that they brought with them because the less they have to bring back They can might be able to get a smaller truck and they save money, you know, yes

359
00:29:07,872 --> 00:29:10,230
Rym: You'll find deals like our friend Scott Johnson.

360
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:15,650
Rym: He just wanders around to every bin where someone's like five DVDs for five bucks get these out of my store.

361
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:20,464
Scott: Yeah I'll just buy them all over spent a lot of money to get their dealers table at Otakon so they need to.

362
00:29:20,564 --> 00:29:26,330
Scott: they're gonna sell as much there as they Can to get their money's worth, you know, you know, they bring it back to this store.

363
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:30,310
Scott: They basically lost money in some sort of indirect way.

364
00:29:30,932 --> 00:29:37,068
Scott: So they're desperate to sell whatever they can and on Sunday when it's the last day You can freakin rake it in if you know what you're doing.

365
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,295
Rym: Yep Don't be afraid to haggle.

366
00:29:38,415 --> 00:29:39,762
Rym: just if you see something you can't afford.

367
00:29:39,802 --> 00:29:42,674
Rym: just ask them if they'll sell to you for five bucks Less if you'll pay cash.

368
00:29:42,774 --> 00:29:49,430
Scott: Yeah, the only real reason to buy something before Sunday is if it's really, you know You might you know have trouble carrying it or something.

369
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:52,159
Scott: There's some sort of situation or it's gonna sell out right away.

370
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,183
Rym: cars a cactuar.

371
00:29:53,705 --> 00:29:54,006
Rym: Yeah.

372
00:29:54,126 --> 00:30:03,145
Rym: Yeah way back We always wanted a cactuar plushie and they hadn't been manufactured for a while and they definitely weren't being sold in the u.s.

373
00:30:03,185 --> 00:30:03,729
Rym: Legitimately.

374
00:30:03,749 --> 00:30:14,023
Rym: and One day we saw one at the con and this dealer this dealer guy who was like wearing stilts We're standing there holding it and we ran over like can we buy your cactuar?

375
00:30:14,043 --> 00:30:14,826
Rym: can about your cactuar.

376
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:17,506
Rym: and he looked at us And he hugged it close to his chest and he shook his head.

377
00:30:18,911 --> 00:30:20,657
Scott: That's cuz it was his and not for sale.

378
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:28,445
Rym: Yeah bastard fast forward two years into the future I'm at katsucon and I look and I see this little bin and then this bin.

379
00:30:28,465 --> 00:30:32,852
Rym: I see a cactuar and I Freak out.

380
00:30:32,912 --> 00:30:36,066
Rym: I reached to grab it and my friend Bruce is right there next to me who also wanted.

381
00:30:36,147 --> 00:30:39,410
Rym: one reaches to grab it And we're standing there and we're holding this cactuar.

382
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:45,402
Rym: It's ultra rare plushie and we're looking at each other and he's in the Navy so he can pretty much just kill me and take it.

383
00:30:46,589 --> 00:30:47,954
Rym: and Then we look and there's another cactuar.

384
00:30:48,456 --> 00:30:56,929
Rym: there were in fact three in the entire convention and we bought them both and the third one sold immediately to some guy who was standing right there and the whole rest of the con.

385
00:30:57,491 --> 00:31:00,970
Rym: Everyone kept asking us where we got the cactuars and we told him yeah that dealer.

386
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:10,550
Rym: Sunday we run into that dealer and he sees the cactuars and he says and I quote So you're the bastards, you know, how many people have been asking me for freaking cactuars?

387
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:13,920
Scott: Yeah, that's what happens if you get something ultra rare.

388
00:31:14,462 --> 00:31:15,606
Rym: They're not that rare anymore.

389
00:31:15,646 --> 00:31:16,670
Rym: It looks like they remade him.

390
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:18,858
Scott: They remade him, but I think those are a different version.

391
00:31:18,878 --> 00:31:20,645
Scott: They're not the exact same cactuar.

392
00:31:20,906 --> 00:31:23,982
Scott: I'll say yeah I like the one we've got the best.

393
00:31:24,022 --> 00:31:25,029
Scott: the other ones are not so good.

394
00:31:26,231 --> 00:31:30,509
Rym: Our friend Alex did the same thing with a little Tonberry, but I think he ordered it online somewhere.

395
00:31:30,529 --> 00:31:33,970
Scott: actually Oh, he went to the dealer and the dealer didn't have something he wanted.

396
00:31:34,071 --> 00:31:45,221
Scott: So he said do you have this and the guy says no But I have it at my store and the guy the dealer went to his store that night got it and brought it back To the con so Alex could pick it up for him the next day.

397
00:31:45,241 --> 00:31:46,546
Rym: Yeah, talk to the dealers.

398
00:31:46,586 --> 00:31:47,329
Rym: They'll work with you.

399
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:59,656
Scott: Yeah, so like if a guy is every plushie in the known universe like I remember There was a these pac-man and you would put batteries in them and they're the pac-man ghosts and they would walk around and they're really Cool, but they didn't have green.

400
00:31:59,676 --> 00:32:01,305
Scott: so I was like do you have green?

401
00:32:01,345 --> 00:32:04,277
Scott: and they were like, you know If they did if they made green we'd have it.

402
00:32:04,778 --> 00:32:06,143
Scott: So I found out they didn't make green.

403
00:32:06,444 --> 00:32:08,089
Scott: But you know what if they?

404
00:32:09,471 --> 00:32:13,268
Scott: If they would have made green and they just didn't have one there they would have brought one for me.

405
00:32:14,711 --> 00:32:22,976
Rym: Now to get back on to the actual advice part instead of us reminiscing Leaving the con on Sunday Basically, you have to forego sleep.

406
00:32:23,377 --> 00:32:26,286
Rym: Just remember that you can sleep Sunday night when you get home.

407
00:32:26,927 --> 00:32:27,870
Rym: You can sleep later.

408
00:32:28,551 --> 00:32:38,030
Rym: Don't sleep Sunday morning and don't sleep in most hotels make you check out around noon So you got to be out of the room and paid by noon and the cons usually end early afternoon.

409
00:32:38,211 --> 00:32:39,836
Scott: Very few of them go all day Sunday.

410
00:32:40,297 --> 00:32:42,043
Rym: now that in itself doesn't sound so bad.

411
00:32:42,103 --> 00:32:47,830
Rym: Like alright you get up at say, you know 11 get out of the room check out and go to the con.

412
00:32:48,818 --> 00:32:50,402
Rym: No first off.

413
00:32:51,133 --> 00:32:53,069
Rym: Everyone else has the same idea.

414
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:54,900
Rym: So you'll get real.

415
00:32:54,941 --> 00:32:55,950
Rym: you'll be ready to leave your room.

416
00:32:56,030 --> 00:33:01,290
Rym: You try to go downstairs and there will be an infinite number of fanboys standing around every elevator.

417
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,016
Rym: Half of them will break from the strain.

418
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:07,592
Rym: It takes about two and a half hours to actually check out of a crowded convention hotel Mm-hmm.

419
00:33:08,234 --> 00:33:08,755
Scott: That's for sure.

420
00:33:09,136 --> 00:33:18,750
Rym: So basically what you have to do is seriously get up at like 6 in the morning Gather all your stuff and if everyone else in the room socks and isn't gonna do it do it on your own.

421
00:33:19,173 --> 00:33:24,686
Rym: Get all your stuff put it on your car pay Wherever you have to pay and then get the hell out of that room and go.

422
00:33:24,706 --> 00:33:27,897
Scott: enjoy the convention Mm-hmm cons on Sunday.

423
00:33:27,917 --> 00:33:29,221
Scott: They start at 8 a.m.

424
00:33:29,262 --> 00:33:33,997
Scott: Or whatever, you know, and if you wait until like, you know Noon to get your stuff out of your room.

425
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,266
Scott: You basically missed 8 to noon.

426
00:33:36,286 --> 00:33:36,788
Scott: That's 4 hours.

427
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:44,249
Rym: Just threw away if you check out by 9 a.m It'll take you about 45 minutes to check out and clear out the room and all that stuff.

428
00:33:44,852 --> 00:33:51,768
Rym: If you try to check out around 11 or noon, it'll take you about an hour and a half Maybe two hours.

429
00:33:53,091 --> 00:34:00,981
Scott: Now make sure that you go over that room and you make sure absolutely No, nothing is left in there because people will leave shit there.

430
00:34:01,101 --> 00:34:01,844
Scott: I guarantee it.

431
00:34:02,185 --> 00:34:03,750
Rym: Yeah, we've had people leave shoes.

432
00:34:04,032 --> 00:34:05,630
Rym: We told you about all that in another podcast.

433
00:34:05,771 --> 00:34:10,708
Rym: Yeah, I think we did but basically keep your stuff together and worry about your own stuff first.

434
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:16,590
Rym: If you kept all your stuff in a spot, like we told you before you probably have much trouble unless someone moved it.

435
00:34:17,853 --> 00:34:18,520
Scott: Someone moved it.

436
00:34:18,561 --> 00:34:19,168
Scott: God help them.

437
00:34:22,306 --> 00:34:28,014
Rym: And If you're the one who paid for the room and you didn't collect money yet You're screwed.

438
00:34:28,195 --> 00:34:30,206
Rym: collect the money before you even let people into that room.

439
00:34:30,226 --> 00:34:35,149
Rym: Yeah There's no way you're gonna hunt everyone down and collect all that money while you're checking out.

440
00:34:36,431 --> 00:34:39,469
Rym: Also, if you need the cash to check out don't make the mistake.

441
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:42,150
Rym: We did the first time we ever got a hotel room at a big con.

442
00:34:42,911 --> 00:34:45,467
Rym: Sure, everyone paid me before it was time to check out.

443
00:34:46,315 --> 00:34:47,429
Rym: Most of them wrote me a check.

444
00:34:48,411 --> 00:34:51,489
Rym: So I'm standing where means got her standing at the checkout desk of the hotel.

445
00:34:51,891 --> 00:34:57,089
Rym: We've got like eight checks with us for varying amounts of money, but no cash to actually pay.

446
00:34:58,511 --> 00:35:00,542
Scott: Yeah, the hotels don't like that.

447
00:35:00,602 --> 00:35:06,186
Scott: They can't really take a check from you Yeah, and if you don't have a nice credit card then they're gonna yell you.

448
00:35:06,748 --> 00:35:08,477
Rym: yeah, of course now We have a million credit cards.

449
00:35:08,497 --> 00:35:10,368
Rym: You actually have money but back then we didn't have money.

450
00:35:11,431 --> 00:35:15,870
Rym: Now Sunday at the con there's actually a lot going on but not so much for the events.

451
00:35:16,472 --> 00:35:23,122
Rym: Sunday is generally a really laid-back day and you'll usually just run into all the people you might have seen once or tries During the con and just chill with them.

452
00:35:23,142 --> 00:35:26,866
Scott: Mm-hmm That's a hanging out that you definitely don't want to miss out on.

453
00:35:26,987 --> 00:35:36,285
Rym: Yep one year we just sat in a lobby and played a Puerto Rico German board game until they kicked us out of the convention center and a Bunch of people came over and joined in and talked to us and it was just fun.

454
00:35:36,305 --> 00:35:36,808
Rym: Mm-hmm.

455
00:35:37,812 --> 00:35:42,890
Rym: And one thing I can highly highly recommend is that most cons have some sort of closing ceremonies or feedback session.

456
00:35:43,673 --> 00:35:45,250
Rym: They are usually hilarious.

457
00:35:45,912 --> 00:35:50,810
Scott: Yeah, the opening ceremonies are usually like lame Like no one goes to them for a reason.

458
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:54,710
Rym: Yeah anime central is really the only con I've ever seen that had a funny opening ceremony.

459
00:35:55,232 --> 00:35:59,790
Scott: But at the closing ceremonies all the con staff they're like done doing all the work they have to do.

460
00:35:59,971 --> 00:36:01,219
Scott: They're just like yeah, whatever.

461
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:01,863
Scott: It's all over.

462
00:36:01,904 --> 00:36:02,870
Scott: I don't care anymore.

463
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:03,819
Scott: They have.

464
00:36:03,879 --> 00:36:05,070
Scott: no they haven't had enough sleep.

465
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:10,910
Rym: You know back panels are our exquisite treasures to reminisce forever.

466
00:36:11,191 --> 00:36:15,566
Rym: I wish someone recorded them all the what the first con feedback panel we ever went to.

467
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:16,530
Rym: we went to it on a lark.

468
00:36:17,312 --> 00:36:18,274
Rym: It had everything.

469
00:36:18,615 --> 00:36:27,369
Rym: it had stupid fanboys complaining about things that no one except stupid fanboys would care about and con staff telling them to You know be quiet and just ignore not worry about it.

470
00:36:29,191 --> 00:36:36,070
Rym: It had crazy cosplay people complaining about the cosplay in ways that I didn't think people could complain about cosplays.

471
00:36:37,152 --> 00:36:38,920
Rym: It had the staff actually answering questions.

472
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,270
Rym: We had very logically and concisely.

473
00:36:42,632 --> 00:36:43,696
Rym: What was it you asked about?

474
00:36:43,997 --> 00:36:45,283
Rym: chairs at the concert, right?

475
00:36:45,644 --> 00:36:45,865
Scott: Yeah.

476
00:36:45,925 --> 00:36:47,070
Scott: Why did the concert have chairs?

477
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,436
Scott: Why wasn't it just general admission?

478
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:55,108
Scott: and the guy was like I wanted to be general admission so bad But I couldn't do it and I'm like as long as I know you wanted it to be so bad.

479
00:36:55,188 --> 00:37:05,768
Scott: It's okay Yep, and then like he came over to me and he was like, oh my god You know if the guy comes over to you after answering your question officially to talk to you more That means your question is probably good.

480
00:37:07,331 --> 00:37:12,230
Rym: Now last and least and we're gonna do a whole show on this someday because it applies to life in general.

481
00:37:12,673 --> 00:37:16,805
Rym: But we're gonna talk about it now specifically from a con perspective drama.

482
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:20,559
Scott: Drama is only caused by stupidity.

483
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,750
Scott: if there is no stupidity there can be no drama by definition.

484
00:37:24,032 --> 00:37:25,721
Rym: Yep, we started talking about it earlier.

485
00:37:25,781 --> 00:37:37,710
Rym: We got sidetracked, but basically You can be friends with people who have drama surrounding them But and you can have fun with them at a convention But if they're in your room, you're gonna have to deal with their drama.

486
00:37:38,652 --> 00:37:43,946
Rym: If you have friends who are prone to drama not to be mean, but have them stay with someone else.

487
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:45,290
Rym: You'll thank yourself later.

488
00:37:45,651 --> 00:38:03,703
Scott: I mean this drama can range from two people in your room, you know Or maybe one person in your room Just having a fight with someone and being all mopey or being all grunty around your room to like I don't know someone in the room Doing it and then trying to kill themselves and God knows that kind of crazy stuff.

489
00:38:04,084 --> 00:38:10,810
Rym: Yeah, we had some friends Who basically to cut a long and embarrassing and kind of scary story short?

490
00:38:11,371 --> 00:38:28,709
Rym: This dude like took a stole a cosplay costume from some another friend of ours who was doing a cosplay or something and none of these people were in our room and it basically came down to one person's older brother appearing and Actively trying to beat to death the said person who took the cosplay object.

491
00:38:30,112 --> 00:38:41,276
Scott: It was an asshole doing something assholish because he was stupid and then a stupid guy Deciding to try to solve him problem with violence instead of police because he was stupid and Drama ensued.

492
00:38:41,377 --> 00:38:43,188
Scott: stupidity plus stupidity equals drama.

493
00:38:43,469 --> 00:38:52,243
Rym: now Luckily half the people who were in that room I have to saw her who were involved in that Said hey, we want to stay with rumin Scott this year because there's no drama with them ever.

494
00:38:52,645 --> 00:38:52,845
Scott: Yep.

495
00:38:53,307 --> 00:38:54,110
Scott: So think about it.

496
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:58,470
Scott: There was a drama involving what maybe three or four people total, right?

497
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:01,029
Rym: And it almost ruined the con for all of them.

498
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:05,790
Scott: Yeah, and in the room with those people were like in their group were like eight people total.

499
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:10,049
Scott: So four people almost had their cons ruined by four people who were all dumb.

500
00:39:10,911 --> 00:39:15,630
Scott: So those four people if they would have stayed with us with our drama listeners, they would have been all set.

501
00:39:15,991 --> 00:39:18,961
Scott: Yeah, so if you get caught with drama just run away.

502
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:27,690
Rym: run away and don't involve yourself with it whatsoever Like if a guy and a girl who you're friends with are dating But they're in the middle of a bad row and they're fighting with each other all the time.

503
00:39:28,051 --> 00:39:35,782
Rym: You don't want them in the room because conventions add stress and stress causes violent breakup in the middle of your Saturday night party Mm-hmm.

504
00:39:37,094 --> 00:39:38,109
Scott: Yeah, that would be scary.

505
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:44,010
Rym: Yeah, I mean there have been situations where someone was just kicked out of their room and didn't have anywhere to stay for the night.

506
00:39:45,452 --> 00:39:46,720
Rym: What other stupid stories have we heard?

507
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,450
Rym: people get drunk and pass out and almost die?

508
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:54,770
Scott: People spend all their money and then start begging for it God.

509
00:39:55,550 --> 00:40:02,492
Rym: Yeah, I mean if basically this really applies to the people who run the rooms don't let people who have drama stay in your room With you.

510
00:40:02,512 --> 00:40:07,304
Rym: and of course, I don't know how that'll help because then the people who have drama I don't know where they stay.

511
00:40:07,365 --> 00:40:11,177
Scott: I guess Other they stay alone or they don't come.

512
00:40:11,598 --> 00:40:15,148
Scott: if they don't come it makes the convention better because then more drama less people come.

513
00:40:15,409 --> 00:40:17,348
Scott: yeah You know, it's all good.

514
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:22,330
Scott: Eventually, we'll get rid of all the stupid people and then the common cons will be perfect with no drama whatsoever.

515
00:40:22,833 --> 00:40:29,747
Rym: Well, I mean, I guess we it's partly that we've been lucky and to that We have a really good group of friends and like even primary friends and peripheral friends.

516
00:40:29,767 --> 00:40:30,469
Rym: They're all really cool.

517
00:40:30,953 --> 00:40:36,250
Rym: Like we leave all our money and wallets out in the room No one even like considers the idea that someone would steal anything.

518
00:40:36,932 --> 00:40:41,847
Rym: But yet I hear stories from people who like someone stole 20 bucks out of the hotel fund before they left.

519
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:50,720
Scott: Yeah Now Another thing is no matter how nice or helpful or whatever you think you're doing Don't try to help solve a drama.

520
00:40:51,062 --> 00:40:53,010
Scott: Don't try to avert a drama.

521
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:56,900
Scott: Don't try to do anything to it because you know what.

522
00:40:57,001 --> 00:41:02,010
Scott: as soon as you put your hand in there to try to change it For better for worse you're now a part of it.

523
00:41:02,352 --> 00:41:05,470
Rym: It's like when two dogs are fighting and you try to break them up and then they both bite you.

524
00:41:05,791 --> 00:41:10,746
Scott: Yeah, now you got to worry because if you're a smart guy like us, right?

525
00:41:10,786 --> 00:41:21,899
Scott: Let's say we let's say it was Let's say it was me Rym and three other people and you're one of the three other people and the two other people that I haven't mentioned Get in a fight and you try to help them.

526
00:41:22,542 --> 00:41:27,119
Scott: when we cast away those two people We're casting away you with them is because you're attached.

527
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,777
Rym: Yep, basically in every group social group of people There are designated problem solvers.

528
00:41:32,898 --> 00:41:33,640
Rym: It just seems to happen.

529
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:46,790
Rym: naturally like there's always one or two people who whenever there's shit that goes down they're the one who steps up deals with it and meters out the consequences and Our group we tend to be those people Mm-hmm, so find someone like that in your group.

530
00:41:47,131 --> 00:41:57,006
Rym: If two people are fighting and you're not a hundred percent confident that you can deal with it Don't deal with it Let someone else deal with it or walk away or just vow to never let them stay with you again.

531
00:41:57,026 --> 00:41:58,170
Scott: I got nothing to do.

532
00:42:00,191 --> 00:42:00,933
Scott: That's all I gotta say.

533
00:42:01,535 --> 00:42:06,790
Rym: I guess the only contradiction to that advice is that if there's a dangerous situation deal with it immediately.

534
00:42:07,116 --> 00:42:15,017
Rym: Yes, of course I mean if you have to call the police if something bad happens at a con don't pretend it'll go away Unless it's something minor and stupid.

535
00:42:15,298 --> 00:42:16,422
Rym: if there's a real problem.

536
00:42:16,683 --> 00:42:18,290
Rym: Just let a professional handle it.

537
00:42:18,471 --> 00:42:24,550
Scott: Yeah, and even though you might look like an idiot There's nothing wrong with yelling really loud at the convention for security or con staff.

538
00:42:24,711 --> 00:42:26,538
Rym: Yes going on at Otakon.

539
00:42:26,598 --> 00:42:29,490
Rym: if you yell for security special ops is there in a second?

540
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:33,004
Scott: Yeah, you know people might look at you be like hey you were yelling.

541
00:42:33,024 --> 00:42:37,182
Scott: that was weird and you know You'll get attention, but you'll fix whatever was fixing.

542
00:42:37,323 --> 00:42:38,669
Scott: if it was needed do it.

543
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:52,650
Rym: Yep now if you're the kind of person who's confident to deal with these situations and you think that you have enough authority over your friends in That circumstance to deal with the problem go for it, but be warned that that's a very dangerous road to follow.

544
00:42:53,492 --> 00:43:14,125
Rym: Mmm, I mean I've personally intervened in some situations like that before both in my official capacity as you know Running an anime club back in the day and just as my Unofficial position of I happen to be there and in both cases no matter how well you think you're handling it There's always something you're not thinking about or there's just there's too much stupidity around.

545
00:43:14,206 --> 00:43:15,049
Rym: you're gonna get caught in it.

546
00:43:15,571 --> 00:43:25,037
Scott: It's time for the fun analogy game if someone's about to fall off a cliff And you try to reach your hand over to grab them and catch them and pull them back up You might end up falling down.

547
00:43:25,459 --> 00:43:28,590
Scott: Yep, so don't let drama ruin the convention.

548
00:43:29,214 --> 00:43:37,869
Rym: Yeah, I mean the only real advice there is that Either don't let people who have drama come with you, and if they do let their drama burn them and not you mm-hmm.

549
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:44,217
Rym: So I think we've pretty much run out of useful things to talk about for a series on convention So I'll probably end it here.

550
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:45,143
Scott: great now.

551
00:43:45,183 --> 00:43:46,109
Scott: What are we gonna do next?

552
00:43:47,051 --> 00:43:50,011
Rym: Maybe we just do one where you just tell stories from conventions We got.

553
00:43:50,031 --> 00:43:51,998
Rym: it's not like we don't have an infinite number of them.

554
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:57,817
Scott: Yeah, well the convention season starting about now We've got some February cons coming up.

555
00:43:58,139 --> 00:43:58,319
Rym: Yep.

556
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,510
Rym: We're not doing anything at it, but I'm at least gonna be at Katsucon.

557
00:44:01,811 --> 00:44:05,670
Scott: Yeah, and I think I'm almost certain I go into the New York comic-con and possibly uber khan.

558
00:44:05,871 --> 00:44:08,289
Rym: Yeah, I think we're both going to uber khan unless it conflicts with things.

559
00:44:08,651 --> 00:44:14,247
Rym: Yeah, I'm gonna be speaking doing at least one panel at an amazement in May.

560
00:44:14,307 --> 00:44:20,120
Rym: I think mm-hmm There's some tentative news that we might be doing GeekNights live at Otakon.

561
00:44:20,482 --> 00:44:22,990
Rym: maybe we mentioned that in the forums a while ago.

562
00:44:23,471 --> 00:44:29,710
Scott: Yeah, that's why you should keep checking out the forums cuz you'd find out cool stuff like the fact that this podcast is available yesterday.

563
00:44:32,611 --> 00:44:36,649
Scott: So if you're not checking our website in your forums, you're you're getting stuff a little slow there.

564
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:49,241
Rym: Yeah times cuz we actually got the news that we're most likely going to be doing many GeekNights things at Otakon About a week ago and everyone who reads the forums knows about it, but you guys don't Mm-hmm.

565
00:44:50,512 --> 00:44:56,250
Scott: So if you want to check us out just go to Otakon and you'll meet us a hundred percent guarantee it.

566
00:44:56,631 --> 00:45:00,787
Rym: Yeah, oh, we'll also be at Tora Khan at RIT in Rochester.

567
00:45:00,807 --> 00:45:04,228
Rym: Oh, yeah they don't have the website up yet, but I'll yell at him about that.

568
00:45:04,248 --> 00:45:06,195
Scott: and That's not all.

569
00:45:06,255 --> 00:45:08,549
Scott: we might go to some more conventions as we decide to.

570
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:14,562
Rym: Yeah, because now that we have money and we're not poor college kids We go to almost any convention that's worth going to.

571
00:45:14,582 --> 00:45:15,889
Rym: that we can afford to.

572
00:45:16,512 --> 00:45:19,544
Scott: Yep, according to the rules we talked about three podcasts ago.

573
00:45:19,765 --> 00:45:19,966
Rym: Yep.

574
00:45:19,986 --> 00:45:28,965
Rym: Well two podcasts ago Because I used to go to anime central and I love that con It's still on my list of one of my favorite cons, but Chicago is too far away from New York City.

575
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:30,690
Rym: It's real flying socks.

576
00:45:31,635 --> 00:45:32,329
Scott: It's too expensive.

577
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:34,737
Rym: Yeah, though a son was really worth it.

578
00:45:34,777 --> 00:45:36,163
Rym: I had some damn good times there.

579
00:45:36,404 --> 00:45:36,966
Scott: So go there.

580
00:45:37,528 --> 00:45:39,816
Scott: Yeah I'm going to PAX.

581
00:45:40,742 --> 00:45:41,889
Rym: Oh, we've always wanted to go to PAX.

582
00:45:42,131 --> 00:45:44,178
Rym: It's just a matter of you know in there.

583
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,603
Scott: the one thing that really keeps you from going to PAX is the East Coast PAX rumor.

584
00:45:48,733 --> 00:45:53,768
Rym: Yeah, if there's an East Coast pet well, actually we had a plan that packs is the penny arcade Expo if you don't know.

585
00:45:53,788 --> 00:45:57,478
Rym: and We decided one year that we were gonna go to PAX.

586
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:03,020
Rym: and because our tradition as our group of friends is generally we go to Otakon and then we are good friend.

587
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:10,570
Rym: Scott Johnson has a beach house in Wildwood, New Jersey And we'll go there then for like the next week afterward and just chill and reminisce about the con and swim.

588
00:46:11,872 --> 00:46:15,970
Rym: And we decided that we were gonna get a bunch of sand and seawater from the East Coast.

589
00:46:16,693 --> 00:46:26,690
Rym: And if we ever went to PAX, we were going to anoint Gabe and Tycho either forcibly or Maybe with some sort of permission depending on the circumstances

590
00:46:27,473 --> 00:46:40,549
Scott: Mm-hmm, but They did come to the East Coast actually relatively recently again for I think the second or third time But they went to the Baltimore comic-con, which we couldn't go to Con but it was real small.

591
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:51,330
Rym: Yeah I mean Otakon takes up the entire Baltimore Convention Center and more The Baltimore comic-con takes up like couple of rooms and the convention is smaller than the dealers room of Otakon.

592
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:55,103
Scott: Yeah, yeah, so we didn't go to that.

593
00:46:55,163 --> 00:46:56,370
Scott: and then I think they went to some other.

594
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:59,705
Scott: I think they went to MIT and spoke or something, but we didn't go to that either.

595
00:46:59,725 --> 00:47:00,750
Scott: Yeah, we're actually busy.

596
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:02,054
Rym: There's a reason why we didn't go.

597
00:47:02,255 --> 00:47:06,609
Scott: Yeah, but you know those bastards they were gonna come to Otakon once and they didn't.

598
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,318
Rym: Yeah that Otakon we were at.

599
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:10,490
Rym: we expected him to be there but now they backed out last minute.

600
00:47:10,912 --> 00:47:19,117
Scott: Well, I knew they canceled right before the con but you know still bastards We'll get them one day one day.

601
00:47:19,137 --> 00:47:22,145
Rym: Yeah in closing go to conventions.

602
00:47:22,305 --> 00:47:22,967
Rym: They're awesome.

603
00:47:22,987 --> 00:47:35,485
Rym: Mm-hmm I don't know what else I can say There and that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
