00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,079
Rym: It's Tuesday, August 9th, 2011.

2
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:12,540
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,701 --> 00:00:13,242
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,322 --> 00:00:14,887
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,927 --> 00:00:18,192
Rym: Tonight, two games, Taluva and Reef Encounter.

6
00:00:21,614 --> 00:00:22,675
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,038 --> 00:00:33,894
Rym: Poking around on the Kotaku and I saw an article that was, I don't know, I feel like I have to say something about this.

8
00:00:33,914 --> 00:00:35,299
Rym: Alright.

9
00:00:35,379 --> 00:00:44,644
Rym: So the title was Dammit Zynga and it was by Kirk Hamilton and he's basically- I agree, I agree, for Facebook games.

10
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:50,792
Rym: but I've played Farmville a little bit which I take issue with that phrasing because you don't really play Farmville.

11
00:00:50,812 --> 00:00:54,504
Scott: But the point is he checked it out for research purposes at least.

12
00:00:54,684 --> 00:01:03,874
Rym: But the gist of this article is that there is The Sims Social Game, the Facebook game that's kind of like modeled on the Zynga stuff.

13
00:01:03,894 --> 00:01:06,045
Scott: Right, but it's not actually made by Will Wright.

14
00:01:06,085 --> 00:01:07,050
Rym: No, it's made by EA.

15
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:12,994
Scott: Yeah, he doesn't work at EA anymore so EA just took a brand they own and slapped it on a Farmville clone, right?

16
00:01:13,095 --> 00:01:15,443
Rym: Yep, so here's this guy's complaint.

17
00:01:16,225 --> 00:01:25,530
Rym: He wanted a Sims Facebook game that was awesome and he played this Sims Facebook game based on Zynga bullshit made by EA.

18
00:01:26,452 --> 00:01:32,810
Rym: You know, Facebook game, social game, all the buzzwords for shitty-ass game design.

19
00:01:33,251 --> 00:01:37,605
Rym: And he complained that it was shitty and spammy and looked exactly like a Zynga game.

20
00:01:40,232 --> 00:01:41,415
Scott: Was he just stupid?

21
00:01:41,455 --> 00:01:45,950
Rym: There's like 20 paragraphs here on what's annoying about the game.

22
00:01:46,853 --> 00:01:50,646
Rym: Every time I try to do something it keeps popping up to share this with friends.

23
00:01:51,449 --> 00:01:53,375
Scott: Because it's a Facebook game.

24
00:01:53,736 --> 00:01:55,865
Scott: It's like just because it says Sims- It's not a Facebook game.

25
00:01:55,905 --> 00:02:01,445
Rym: I would argue that games like Zynga and The Sims Social are almost viruses.

26
00:02:01,626 --> 00:02:09,372
Scott: But the point is, it's like, why did he think that just because it was called The Sims it was going to be anything like The Sims?

27
00:02:09,473 --> 00:02:12,528
Scott: Why do you even- Why not just play the real Sims?

28
00:02:12,548 --> 00:02:14,296
Scott: If he likes it, I'm sure he already has it.

29
00:02:14,317 --> 00:02:20,924
Rym: He does make an argument that one thing that could be said is that you could make, theoretically, a cool Sims Social game.

30
00:02:20,984 --> 00:02:23,338
Scott: Imagine if you had- How would it be different from regular Sims?

31
00:02:23,358 --> 00:02:24,906
Rym: Imagine if you had, say, Facebook, right?

32
00:02:24,926 --> 00:02:25,670
Rym: It's got all your friends.

33
00:02:26,092 --> 00:02:29,028
Rym: Say it made a Sim based on every one of your friends.

34
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,669
Rym: And then you could basically have a dollhouse of your friends like, "Oh, Scott keeps making out with Rainbow Dash.

35
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:35,672
Rym: Ha ha ha ha.

36
00:02:36,093 --> 00:02:40,908
Rym: Oh look, Pete and my coworker keep fighting because they disagree on political

37
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:41,792
Rym: stuff.".

38
00:02:42,635 --> 00:02:47,249
Rym: But I would argue that there was no possibility of that being made because one, it's EA.

39
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,696
Rym: Two, it's a social game.

40
00:02:50,238 --> 00:02:51,000
Rym: Social meaning.

41
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:52,686
Rym: we're cloning Zynga's bullshit.

42
00:02:53,690 --> 00:03:03,326
Scott: This is yet more of that never-ending discussion about people confusing the surface level parts of a game with, you know, it's like people can't look past it.

43
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:11,200
Scott: When I see a game, all that stuff that's on top, you know, Puerto Rico, if I look at Puerto Rico, all the boats and all that stuff just disappears.

44
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:11,922
Rym: No, here's what he said.

45
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:12,905
Rym: I'll sum up his article.

46
00:03:13,587 --> 00:03:21,313
Rym: I bought a smelly, dodgy looking burrito from a hobo who I know was watching other hobos make poop burritos.

47
00:03:22,196 --> 00:03:24,243
Rym: The burrito was surprisingly filled with poop.

48
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,999
Rym: And then I'm going to complain about how Chipotle has awesome burritos.

49
00:03:28,059 --> 00:03:29,225
Rym: Why didn't he have a Chipotle?

50
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,366
Scott: He put a Chipotle sticker on it that he stole from a Chipotle.

51
00:03:33,427 --> 00:03:33,668
Scott: Yeah.

52
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,139
Rym: No, but it wouldn't even be that.

53
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,711
Rym: It would be as though someone...

54
00:03:37,731 --> 00:03:40,124
Scott: No, he wrapped it in gold foil just like Chipotle.

55
00:03:40,406 --> 00:03:41,514
Rym: It's not even gold foil.

56
00:03:41,615 --> 00:03:42,340
Rym: I'm going to be blunt.

57
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,054
Rym: It's very rare that I will have unqualified opinions on things like this.

58
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:55,170
Rym: Zynga, not even Zynga, anyone who makes a social game where they say it is a social game is a bad person and the game they're making is a virus.

59
00:03:55,371 --> 00:03:57,964
Scott: I should make a good game and just call it a social game.

60
00:03:58,507 --> 00:03:59,391
Rym: But why?

61
00:03:59,451 --> 00:04:00,537
Rym: That word is tainted.

62
00:04:00,738 --> 00:04:01,220
Rym: It's gone.

63
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:01,965
Rym: We've lost it.

64
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:03,520
Rym: There's no way to get that word back.

65
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,307
Scott: Just be... No, not to get it back.

66
00:04:05,347 --> 00:04:06,331
Scott: Who wants the word back?

67
00:04:06,391 --> 00:04:08,340
Scott: Just to fuck with people, right?

68
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,853
Scott: Making games that's not an RPG, call it an RPG.

69
00:04:10,893 --> 00:04:12,482
Scott: Just be like, "Yeah, your terms mean nothing to

70
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:13,005
Scott: me.".

71
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:16,380
Rym: One way around that is, what is Half Minute Hero?

72
00:04:18,226 --> 00:04:20,934
Rym: On the surface, it's kind of a JRPG.

73
00:04:21,014 --> 00:04:25,650
Scott: No, I think it's a... I think it's a light action puzzler.

74
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,421
Rym: I would agree, but you could argue that it is a...

75
00:04:28,442 --> 00:04:30,140
Scott: Because the puzzles are extremely light.

76
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,740
Scott: They pretty much come down to follow, do what people say.

77
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,014
Rym: But it has all the trimmings of a JRPG.

78
00:04:36,074 --> 00:04:37,240
Rym: In fact, you know what I was doing last night?

79
00:04:37,881 --> 00:04:41,460
Rym: Emily had never really seen or played Final Fantasy.

80
00:04:42,002 --> 00:04:42,163
Scott: One?

81
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:42,788
Rym: One.

82
00:04:42,808 --> 00:04:44,220
Rym: In its original form.

83
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,827
Rym: So I got the emulators working because I needed to get a bunch of videos for our upcoming PAX panel.

84
00:04:48,928 --> 00:04:49,900
Scott: Hello, Garland.

85
00:04:50,463 --> 00:04:51,347
Scott: Ah, Garland.

86
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:52,673
Rym: I will knock you all down.

87
00:04:52,914 --> 00:04:54,180
Scott: Talk to bat in corner.

88
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,426
Rym: So you know what's funny?

89
00:04:55,447 --> 00:04:57,824
Rym: I started playing Final Fantasy 1 for like a minute.

90
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:58,933
Rym: I was like, "Yeah, here's what it looks

91
00:04:58,974 --> 00:04:59,175
Rym: like.".

92
00:05:00,022 --> 00:05:01,469
Rym: And I kind of kept playing.

93
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:05,157
Scott: Yeah, but you could only make it as far as the Elf Town before you're like, "Fuck this

94
00:05:05,198 --> 00:05:05,319
Scott: shit.".

95
00:05:05,641 --> 00:05:06,063
Rym: You know what?

96
00:05:06,184 --> 00:05:07,249
Rym: You know what's really funny?

97
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:14,540
Rym: I was grinding and enjoying it, and I got to the Elf Town, and I saved my game, and then I went in to the store.

98
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,767
Rym: And I was like, "Oh, the silver

99
00:05:15,827 --> 00:05:16,532
Rym: sword!".

100
00:05:16,793 --> 00:05:17,377
Scott: Yeah, that's where...

101
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,945
Rym: Yeah, because suddenly my memory zoomed back of hours and hours and hours to buy one fucking silver sword.

102
00:05:24,288 --> 00:05:25,860
Rym: Never mind going to that goddamn marsh cave.

103
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,190
Rym: And that was the end of that.

104
00:05:27,231 --> 00:05:27,678
Rym: But you know what?

105
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,488
Rym: There's something to that formula.

106
00:05:29,548 --> 00:05:33,371
Rym: Even to this day, I can get sucked in, and I had to like reach this moment of...

107
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:34,760
Scott: Just cheat.

108
00:05:35,681 --> 00:05:35,883
Scott: Yeah.

109
00:05:35,943 --> 00:05:37,131
Scott: Just cheat.

110
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:44,385
Scott: You're in an emulator, use the Game Genie part of the emulator to give yourself a zillion levels and a zillion gold, and just buy the silver whatever.

111
00:05:44,425 --> 00:05:58,263
Rym: But just to say that had I not been inoculated and remembered really what that was like, or had I not had this kind of meta knowledge of why grinding is stupid in the modern era, I might've just kept playing Final Fantasy 1.

112
00:05:58,263 --> 00:06:00,479
Rym: It's a powerful pull if you're not ready for it.

113
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:05,380
Scott: No, it's one of those things where even if you know about it, it still works on you.

114
00:06:06,202 --> 00:06:11,320
Scott: Even though you know it's a Skinner box, it doesn't somehow make you immune.

115
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,465
Rym: Yeah, I was about to stop.

116
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:15,061
Rym: And then I see BK, and I'm like, "Hey, Emily, you know who this

117
00:06:15,122 --> 00:06:15,222
Rym: is?".

118
00:06:15,283 --> 00:06:16,089
Rym: She's like a pirate.

119
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:17,116
Rym: I was like, "Not just any

120
00:06:17,157 --> 00:06:17,560
Rym: pirate.".

121
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:18,184
Rym: It's BK.

122
00:06:18,265 --> 00:06:18,910
Rym: It's BK.

123
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:19,898
Rym: And I got the pirate ship.

124
00:06:19,938 --> 00:06:22,589
Rym: I'm like, "Aw shit, I can go get to the elf town

125
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:22,870
Rym: now.".

126
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,540
Rym: And I got really excited, kind of legit excited.

127
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,688
Scott: She's got funny dwarves.

128
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,179
Rym: Oh my god, I love the dwarves.

129
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:35,300
Rym: You realize you get the key from the elves that opens that door in Canaria Castle.

130
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,047
Rym: that gets you the TNT that you give to the dwarves.

131
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,040
Rym: Think about the kind of unstated story there.

132
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:48,460
Rym: The elves gave the humans this weapon of unimaginable magic power, and they locked it in their castle, but they kept the key for dire days in the future.

133
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,410
Rym: But yet, the item they gave them is not magical.

134
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:54,706
Rym: It is simply science that the humans are too dumb to understand.

135
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:59,160
Rym: And even then, they locked it away from the humans so they wouldn't use it until the time was right.

136
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:01,946
Rym: Yeah, I don't know.

137
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:02,910
Rym: I got nothing else there.

138
00:07:03,734 --> 00:07:06,284
Scott: Actually, speaking of emulators, I read this interesting thing today.

139
00:07:07,268 --> 00:07:12,588
Scott: They were talking about, it was on Ars Technica, it was about talking about emulator authenticity.

140
00:07:12,608 --> 00:07:20,180
Scott: And actually it was like, we just use emulators, and for our eyeballs, they're actually pretty damn close to being the real deal.

141
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:27,268
Rym: Well, I've seen some emulators do things like you can turn on or off scanline flicker or like sprite flicker and all that.

142
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:31,246
Scott: But no, but this is like, there's actually things you don't even notice.

143
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,030
Scott: Like you don't even know.

144
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,645
Scott: And apparently, like Nesticle was way not good.

145
00:07:35,766 --> 00:07:40,263
Scott: And Nestopia these days is pretty good, but there's this guy making something called BSNES.

146
00:07:40,303 --> 00:07:44,460
Scott: I think I'm going to switch to it, but it's basically ultra accurate.

147
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:52,609
Scott: Like for example, you wouldn't realize this, but the spinning Triforce spins too fast in like SNES9X or SNES.

148
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:55,578
Scott: There's a video you can watch.

149
00:07:55,618 --> 00:07:59,940
Scott: they have there that shows a time cop and it's way off in ZSNES.

150
00:08:00,221 --> 00:08:14,117
Rym: So there is, I think, a space for both kinds of emulation because sometimes I want to play the game, but I'm okay with the emulator kind of not being accurate or more importantly, letting me like fast forward through the BS.

151
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:14,460
Scott: Yeah.

152
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,120
Rym: But or, you know, save stage because I don't want to actually be...

153
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:22,874
Scott: Well no, it's not, the emulator is not, you know, I don't think the BSNES, I'm not having used it yet, but I don't think it prevents you from doing those things.

154
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:26,880
Scott: It's just, you know, the audio, the video and the timing are all accurate.

155
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:37,153
Rym: I guess I say more conceptually, like an example would be you could have an emulator that emulates the sprite flicker exactly so that, you know, it does the same thing that the physical fucking NES does.

156
00:08:37,174 --> 00:08:37,659
Scott: That's right.

157
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:47,665
Rym: You could even make an emulator that would emulate the common physical problems that would happen because those, you know, it's pretty well established what kinds of artifacting happen in different situations.

158
00:08:48,408 --> 00:08:59,043
Rym: Like I think it would be worth emulating that from a historical standpoint, but simultaneously I don't mind playing say the old super dodgeball with no sprite flicker.

159
00:09:00,469 --> 00:09:19,197
Scott: I think the point is, is that, you know, the point of the article was that to get the emulator to actually be so incredibly accurate, you need to have such, you know, ridiculous synchronized timing of all the different bits such that, you know, BSNES has insane system requirements, even though it's an SNES emulator.

160
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:27,815
Scott: Whereas there are Nintendo 64 emulators that don't give a shit about being accurate, that have almost, you know, poop system requirements like Pentium 2.

161
00:09:27,815 --> 00:09:33,217
Scott: But, you know, to make an accurate N64 emulator would be ungodly, like the computer doesn't even exist.

162
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:40,732
Scott: And they even talked about how there's a Pong emulator, right, that emulates a Pong machine at the transistor level.

163
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:41,217
Scott: Whoa.

164
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:46,680
Scott: And is like, requires like these insane system requirements just to play original Pong.

165
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,046
Rym: These are important though.

166
00:09:48,086 --> 00:09:55,175
Rym: We need, there's definitely, there's the, there's two distinct almost opposed paths of emulation that we definitely need both.

167
00:09:55,677 --> 00:09:57,667
Rym: And I don't think there's enough attention being put to it.

168
00:09:57,688 --> 00:10:01,528
Scott: But it calculates like, you know, the resistances in every transistor.

169
00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:06,250
Rym: I really want to see an NES emulator that has options for physical defects.

170
00:10:06,712 --> 00:10:08,760
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure everything you want exists.

171
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:09,765
Rym: Yeah, or will come.

172
00:10:09,906 --> 00:10:11,860
Scott: But yeah, Nestopia is pretty much the shit.

173
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,191
Scott: But I'm going to try, I've been using SNES 9x.

174
00:10:14,251 --> 00:10:15,799
Scott: I'm going to try to use BSNES.

175
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:18,311
Rym: Oh, I used to always use ZSNES.

176
00:10:18,431 --> 00:10:20,280
Scott: Well, no, ZSNES isn't really that good.

177
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:20,722
Rym: No, it isn't.

178
00:10:21,365 --> 00:10:22,531
Rym: It has not been updated.

179
00:10:23,576 --> 00:10:24,360
Rym: I was using it the other day.

180
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,940
Scott: I'm going to try, I'm going to try this BSNES, see how it's like.

181
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:35,560
Rym: I did realize though, going back through all the old ROMs again, because I got it set up on the HDPC, I really fucking like those Koushibosawa collections.

182
00:10:35,981 --> 00:10:36,545
Scott: Which ones are those?

183
00:10:36,586 --> 00:10:38,420
Rym: Like Gemfire, Arrowbiz.

184
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,643
Rym: Here's like the Executive Series and the Imagination Series and like all these different series of games.

185
00:10:45,106 --> 00:10:46,796
Rym: And they come down to games Rym-liked.

186
00:10:47,198 --> 00:10:47,400
Scott: Okay.

187
00:10:49,662 --> 00:10:51,952
Scott: So did you hear about all this Diablo crap?

188
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:52,916
Scott: Uh, maybe.

189
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,645
Scott: Everybody heard about it, pretty much.

190
00:10:55,927 --> 00:11:00,554
Rym: Yeah, we're on kind of a longer cycle, so we haven't talked about it on GeekNights.

191
00:11:00,615 --> 00:11:01,320
Scott: No, not really.

192
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,680
Rym: We haven't even really talked about it, me and Scott, together.

193
00:11:04,601 --> 00:11:09,025
Scott: So if you don't know, the deal is, right, Diablo 3 is coming out eventually, pretty soon now.

194
00:11:09,106 --> 00:11:10,680
Scott: Maybe less than a year away, who knows.

195
00:11:11,562 --> 00:11:13,513
Scott: I played Diablo 2 actually back in the day.

196
00:11:13,533 --> 00:11:20,219
Scott: As did I. I played it a lot actually, I beat it more than once, and it wasn't until later that I realized, oh, this game is just click click click click.

197
00:11:20,841 --> 00:11:22,067
Rym: I did not play it a lot.

198
00:11:23,313 --> 00:11:25,946
Scott: This was, I was pretty bored in the year of 1999 and 2000.

199
00:11:25,946 --> 00:11:30,431
Rym: Guys, see by then, I would still be playing Civ 2, like why would I play Diablo?

200
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:31,235
Scott: I was playing Civ 2 in '97, '98.

201
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,301
Rym: Yeah, and I kept playing it, '99, 2000, 2000, 1, 2, 3, 4.

202
00:11:36,301 --> 00:11:36,685
Scott: No you didn't.

203
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:38,239
Rym: Yeah, I was playing it at RIT.

204
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,428
Scott: Anyway, you didn't play it that much.

205
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,740
Scott: I didn't play it like 12 hours at a time.

206
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:50,040
Scott: Basically, if you don't, I've never played Diablo, all it is is a game where you walk around and click on monsters and occasionally they drop loot, right?

207
00:11:51,681 --> 00:11:56,625
Scott: And usually there's some number of levels and each level ends with a boss and you beat the game.

208
00:11:56,685 --> 00:12:01,680
Scott: And then you beat the game again on harder difficulty and then again on harder difficulty and you keep your equips, right?

209
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,921
Scott: So you have this character and all you really do is beat this single player game over and over again.

210
00:12:06,564 --> 00:12:10,480
Scott: In Diablo 2, they had two kinds of multiplayer.

211
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,880
Scott: They had open battle net and official battle net.

212
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,340
Scott: So in open battle net, you could take your single player character and just go nuts.

213
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:20,882
Scott: But anything that happened to your character in open battle net stuck to your character, right?

214
00:12:20,922 --> 00:12:24,545
Scott: So if you, you know, you could do PvP, but that was basically just.

215
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:32,745
Scott: you're playing the single player game and other people happened to be there also playing the single player game with you and you could try to attack them if you wanted to.

216
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:38,739
Scott: And if someone killed you, all your shit dropped on the ground and they could take it because you were just like any other bad guy.

217
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:43,242
Scott: And if that happened to you and you went to play single player game, your shit would be gone.

218
00:12:43,826 --> 00:12:52,508
Scott: Battle net, a real battle net, if you didn't hack it or do something shady, made you connect to Blizzard servers where you would play Diablo and you had to start with a new character.

219
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:58,420
Scott: And that new character started off as blank and you could only play that character on blank on battle net.

220
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:04,509
Scott: So you basically, if you wanted to play for serious, you had to play on battle net all the time, right?

221
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,100
Scott: For whatever, with other people.

222
00:13:06,181 --> 00:13:08,560
Scott: And there'd be no cheating and to be ultra secure and whatever.

223
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,757
Rym: No cheating in quotes, but in quotes.

224
00:13:10,818 --> 00:13:11,020
Scott: Right.

225
00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:23,419
Scott: Anyway, so it was kind of weird, though, because people do is they would just cheat on their single player character, but to make like infinite awesome items or whatever other kind of stuff, you know, because a single player, no one gave a fuck.

226
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:23,963
Rym: Yeah.

227
00:13:23,983 --> 00:13:30,500
Scott: And then you go into open battle net and you trade stuff with other people that you would and there would be hacks to duplicate items.

228
00:13:30,821 --> 00:13:37,820
Scott: So it was like this item that was the best item in the game, some kind of ring and everyone would just get enough of them to fully max out everything.

229
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,281
Rym: Yeah.

230
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:43,880
Rym: It was a surprising realm of kind of like old world, like shit cockery.

231
00:13:44,262 --> 00:13:45,154
Rym: It was a weird place.

232
00:13:45,174 --> 00:13:45,620
Scott: Right.

233
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:52,780
Scott: But anyway, so Diablo three is coming out and, you know, Blizzard decided that they were going to make it so you could only play online, period.

234
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,128
Scott: You cannot play offline.

235
00:13:54,188 --> 00:13:57,006
Rym: They made a big deal about how the reason they're doing this.

236
00:13:57,046 --> 00:14:03,886
Rym: The main reason is that they don't want you to have to, you know, say you're playing the game by yourself and you're all cool and then you decide you want to play online.

237
00:14:03,947 --> 00:14:05,279
Rym: They don't want you to have to start over.

238
00:14:05,582 --> 00:14:07,120
Scott: Yeah, but they also want to stop cheating.

239
00:14:07,801 --> 00:14:11,926
Rym: Yeah, but they have to stop cheating, especially if they want to take the same character offline, online.

240
00:14:12,007 --> 00:14:22,106
Rym: And people care about the sort of I don't want to say competition, but the, I guess, fairness of the persistence of a character in an online player versus player space.

241
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:28,180
Scott: It's not a player versus player space, primarily a co-op space where you just have it's like River City Ransom is player versus player.

242
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:33,220
Rym: Now, think about how rapidly the rationalization for this kind of breaks down.

243
00:14:33,621 --> 00:14:41,119
Rym: They don't want people to cheat in a game that's either going to be co-op online or mostly single player at home.

244
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:50,926
Scott: I thought it was funny how most of the gaming news outlets focused on the, you know, pretty much the story that Blizzard is trying to really wants just DRM aspects, which is part of it.

245
00:14:50,967 --> 00:14:52,300
Rym: Now, they said definitely part of it.

246
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:58,407
Scott: And it's bullshit because, you know, what if I want to play on an airplane and there's no Wi-Fi on the airplane?

247
00:14:58,427 --> 00:15:01,382
Scott: or, you know, all these, you know, that's the thing that most people covered.

248
00:15:01,824 --> 00:15:11,340
Scott: Only Jerry at Penny Arcade, you know, came up to the same conclusion I did, which is, you know, by their own, I'll read his paragraph, by their own admission.

249
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,000
Scott: This is this is Jerry at Penny Arcade.

250
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,420
Scott: By their own admission, Diablo is not really focused around the PvP experience.

251
00:15:17,521 --> 00:15:25,100
Scott: If you're playing with someone who has duped items or whatever, all it means is that you'll be more likely to defeat Satan without a means to gain advantage over another.

252
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,860
Scott: Cheating as a concept becomes substantially more opaque.

253
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,360
Scott: Who is the cheated party?

254
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,200
Scott: Precisely Satan the devil.

255
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,206
Scott: Fuck him.

256
00:15:32,226 --> 00:15:33,400
Scott: Who cares?

257
00:15:33,981 --> 00:15:34,262
Scott: Right.

258
00:15:34,524 --> 00:15:40,339
Scott: It's like you're cheating in a single player game, just like I told you to cheat at Final Fantasy to skip over grinding for this episode.

259
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,800
Rym: I mean, is that did I cheat Garland?

260
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,940
Rym: Is Garland like, oh, man, spoilers.

261
00:15:45,141 --> 00:15:45,864
Rym: Oh, you know what?

262
00:15:45,925 --> 00:15:51,320
Rym: By the way, it's way easy to beat Garland at first level if you got two fighters and a red mage in your party.

263
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,400
Scott: But, you know, the point is, like, who are you cheating?

264
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:56,085
Scott: Right.

265
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,520
Scott: Well, what is the point?

266
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,360
Scott: It's one thing to stop cheating in Counter-Strike because you're cheating another human being.

267
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,020
Scott: That guy is getting owned because you're using aimbot and he's not.

268
00:16:04,201 --> 00:16:06,400
Scott: Ah, but Scott, Satan is not a real person.

269
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,125
Rym: That's the.

270
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,000
Scott: that's the who cares.

271
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,640
Rym: So who is being cheated?

272
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,564
Scott: And you know what?

273
00:16:10,584 --> 00:16:13,665
Scott: I can go and watch the ending of the game on YouTube the day it comes out.

274
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:14,480
Scott: Am I cheating?

275
00:16:15,462 --> 00:16:16,085
Scott: Am I cheating?

276
00:16:16,205 --> 00:16:20,062
Rym: No, it only be cheating if you watch it with someone else, because that's co-op.

277
00:16:20,505 --> 00:16:23,280
Rym: OK, so here's who's really being cheated.

278
00:16:23,781 --> 00:16:29,960
Rym: Well, because they've got this auction house, that's the real reason they did all this.

279
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:30,341
Rym: Yeah.

280
00:16:30,783 --> 00:16:31,004
Scott: Right.

281
00:16:31,105 --> 00:16:36,247
Scott: So they're trying to make money, but it's one thing to make money by selling you stuff for World of Warcraft.

282
00:16:36,267 --> 00:16:42,658
Rym: that makes a little bit of sense, like as much as I hate the fucking hats, at least it's B.S.

283
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,880
Rym: that you're buying to share with other people online.

284
00:16:46,482 --> 00:16:46,703
Scott: Right.

285
00:16:47,104 --> 00:16:51,500
Scott: This is like you're buying something to play in a, you know, a single player game.

286
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,279
Scott: That's like if I'm playing River City Ransom and I give someone real money to get a lead pipe right now.

287
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:57,880
Rym: Mario three, world one one.

288
00:16:58,001 --> 00:16:59,479
Rym: Hey, want a hammer suit?

289
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:00,863
Scott: Ten bucks.

290
00:17:01,728 --> 00:17:03,640
Rym: No actual dollars, not coins, bitches.

291
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:03,980
Scott: Yeah.

292
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:07,300
Scott: Actual ten bucks playing Mario three on your own to get a hammer suit.

293
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,667
Scott: Fuck that.

294
00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:09,759
Scott: Are you shitting me?

295
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:18,314
Rym: Interestingly, and we're you know, we're working on a panel for some future packs about this, but look at all the things that came out of turn.

296
00:17:18,354 --> 00:17:22,779
Scott: kind of turn real life pennies into real life rupees in your single player Zelda game.

297
00:17:23,144 --> 00:17:24,358
Rym: But look, there's other things, too.

298
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,365
Rym: There are no bonds.

299
00:17:25,425 --> 00:17:27,900
Rym: They're not allowing modding, no bots.

300
00:17:28,163 --> 00:17:29,179
Rym: They're not allowing bots.

301
00:17:29,903 --> 00:17:31,519
Rym: OK, now, why can't they allow bots?

302
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:38,064
Rym: Because bots could be used to farm and then sell stuff on the auction, devaluing everything.

303
00:17:38,848 --> 00:17:41,140
Scott: It's like they why not?

304
00:17:41,221 --> 00:17:41,829
Scott: Here's an idea.

305
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:42,519
Scott: Here's an idea.

306
00:17:42,701 --> 00:17:43,063
Scott: You ready?

307
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:45,380
Scott: It's a single player fucking game.

308
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,799
Rym: Sell it for 50 bucks and that's it?

309
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,401
Scott: No.

310
00:17:48,265 --> 00:17:51,960
Scott: Why are you letting people fucking trade shit with each other like that?

311
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,500
Rym: Oh, because they also have the online co-op thing.

312
00:17:54,902 --> 00:17:58,322
Rym: And really, you know, I'll skip all the rationalization I was going to try to pull out of my ass.

313
00:17:58,563 --> 00:17:59,548
Rym: Really, it comes down to.

314
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:10,520
Scott: they want to make money on this market and they think that, you know, there's another way to completely eliminate, you know, basically their rationalization was there's going to be a second hand market for stuff anyway.

315
00:18:11,022 --> 00:18:16,024
Scott: So better that we handle it than some, you know, shady operations all set up and take all this money.

316
00:18:16,085 --> 00:18:17,300
Scott: The money is going to move anyway.

317
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,280
Scott: Might as well move to us because we're legit.

318
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,465
Scott: You know what?

319
00:18:20,707 --> 00:18:22,600
Rym: Here's a quote from Blizzard on this.

320
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,000
Rym: OK.

321
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:25,158
Rym: Ultimately, players want it.

322
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:31,684
Rym: If Blizzard doesn't do this system, I'm not so naive to think that third party auctions are not going to happen.

323
00:18:32,207 --> 00:18:34,677
Rym: In the past, we've really taken a hard line stance of.

324
00:18:34,999 --> 00:18:37,360
Rym: we will try to stamp it down every place we can.

325
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,058
Scott: Here's a way to completely eliminate it.

326
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,360
Scott: Guaranteed there will be absolutely no marketplace for traded goods.

327
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,004
Scott: You ready for this?

328
00:18:44,972 --> 00:18:46,020
Scott: Just let people fucking cheat.

329
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,360
Scott: Put cheat codes right in the game.

330
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,833
Scott: Like Doom, Doom, IDDQD.

331
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,360
Scott: You couldn't sell some Doom rocket launcher.

332
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:51,621
Scott: Why?

333
00:18:51,641 --> 00:18:53,660
Scott: Because they could type ADKFA anytime they wanted.

334
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:59,007
Scott: If you just let people put a cheat menu right in the game, just on the front of the screen, don't even hide it.

335
00:18:59,027 --> 00:19:01,040
Scott: Just be like, click here to cheat.

336
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,144
Scott: You click there.

337
00:19:02,385 --> 00:19:07,280
Scott: And there's a menu where you can create any item with any stats you want and just give it to your fucking character.

338
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:15,539
Rym: But Scott, then we won't make as much money on bullshit microtransactions and we won't have an excuse to push our always online DRM.

339
00:19:16,181 --> 00:19:17,840
Scott: It's fine if you want to do those things.

340
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,804
Scott: In fact, you know, Blizzard, I don't really have a problem with you doing those things in your game.

341
00:19:21,844 --> 00:19:24,580
Scott: But you know what I do have a problem with is basically just fucking lying.

342
00:19:24,761 --> 00:19:25,919
Scott: At least come out and say it.

343
00:19:26,341 --> 00:19:28,640
Scott: We just want to make more fucking money.

344
00:19:29,422 --> 00:19:30,399
Rym: That's why we did this.

345
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,299
Scott: They're not actually trying to act like the good guy.

346
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:33,846
Scott: Scott, you're not.

347
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,640
Scott: They're not actually lying because all the things that Zenga doesn't do, that Zenga is like, fuck, yeah, Farmville, give us money.

348
00:19:41,784 --> 00:19:42,108
Scott: Right.

349
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,120
Scott: The Diablo.

350
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,800
Scott: Why do you got to be trying to act like you're a good guy, Blizzard?

351
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,686
Scott: You're no different.

352
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:48,139
Scott: Stop trying to pretend.

353
00:19:48,483 --> 00:19:49,520
Scott: Now, that's my problem.

354
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,280
Rym: I would be now if you wanted to be forget the business language because of whatever business language is business language.

355
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,780
Rym: I don't fault people for omitting the truth because they're not actively lying.

356
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:03,024
Rym: They're just they're saying things that are technically true in the most bare sense of the truth.

357
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:05,134
Scott: The other part of the truth is we just want to make money green.

358
00:20:07,002 --> 00:20:08,100
Scott: Why not Washington?

359
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,954
Rym: Why not set up some sort of?

360
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:10,418
Rym: I don't know.

361
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:18,058
Rym: You buy the game for like 50 bucks and if you want to play online, you have to make another goddamn character like every other game.

362
00:20:19,661 --> 00:20:26,420
Rym: Well, Borderlands and then have an auction house for that, because again, then they wouldn't have an excuse to not have offline mode or the same thing.

363
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,738
Scott: So the same thing is Diablo two.

364
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:29,940
Rym: Now, I wonder if because they're not allowing mods.

365
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:38,038
Rym: I wonder if they're going to at some point have blessed mods that they make or get people to make mods in a marketplace or some B.S.

366
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:38,687
Rym: like that.

367
00:20:38,707 --> 00:20:39,297
Scott: I don't know.

368
00:20:40,303 --> 00:20:41,976
Rym: Are we going to have to start jailbreaking games?

369
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,425
Scott: He has another idea.

370
00:20:43,485 --> 00:20:47,760
Scott: If they wanted to have this not be a problem, just make it a fucking console game instead.

371
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,100
Rym: That's not going to work for much longer.

372
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,020
Scott: It would actually be a lot more comfortable to play Diablo as a console game.

373
00:20:53,221 --> 00:21:00,640
Rym: That won't work for that much longer, though, because I really think Microsoft is going to continue to push toward eventually having PCs and Xboxes.

374
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,060
Scott: The point is, this game is coming out now.

375
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:03,687
Scott: It doesn't matter.

376
00:21:03,748 --> 00:21:04,580
Scott: The future matters, right?

377
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:06,372
Rym: Yeah.

378
00:21:07,018 --> 00:21:07,280
Rym: I don't know.

379
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:17,699
Rym: I think this might give some of the similar games that are coming out a little bit of an advantage, because I think there will be a surprising amount of outrage about this game compared to other similar games.

380
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,540
Scott: I have a thing is I just think Torchlight two actually has a huge advantage here.

381
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,820
Scott: And if they play the move right, they could actually kick Diablo three.

382
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,162
Rym: You know what?

383
00:21:26,182 --> 00:21:28,620
Rym: They could be its equal or better.

384
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,180
Rym: You know what would kick it absolutely over the top?

385
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,020
Rym: If Torchlight had the best goddamn support for mods the world had ever seen.

386
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,418
Scott: I think, you know, they could mod it, especially if you can't mod the same game.

387
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,019
Scott: It's just click on bad guys.

388
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,459
Rym: I mean, look at how popular Dota was.

389
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:41,982
Rym: There's what?

390
00:21:42,203 --> 00:21:44,859
Rym: A billion remakes of it coming out right now.

391
00:21:45,922 --> 00:21:47,780
Rym: It's because you could mod those games.

392
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,780
Rym: If you can't mod Diablo three, you can't mod it.

393
00:21:50,881 --> 00:21:52,300
Rym: And that whole market disappears.

394
00:21:52,481 --> 00:21:59,260
Rym: And if Blizzard thinks they can sell what is basically mods as downloadable content when Torchlight exists, I think they got another thing coming.

395
00:21:59,540 --> 00:21:59,846
Scott: We'll see.

396
00:22:00,437 --> 00:22:00,600
Rym: Yeah.

397
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:07,220
Rym: You know, the problem is I know semantically what should be done from the, I guess, what is all is good and just in the world standpoint.

398
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:09,900
Scott: But that is not going to win you the money.

399
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,179
Rym: If it makes money, it makes money.

400
00:22:12,243 --> 00:22:12,364
Rym: Yeah.

401
00:22:12,404 --> 00:22:13,629
Rym: Why does this go all Zynga?

402
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:17,140
Rym: and just when you install the game, it plays some sort of like pattern that hacks your brain.

403
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,599
Rym: It just makes you give them your credit card number.

404
00:22:19,141 --> 00:22:19,664
Scott: You could do that.

405
00:22:20,449 --> 00:22:22,522
Scott: Or you have to give them a credit card number to prove age.

406
00:22:22,563 --> 00:22:25,020
Scott: And then they just in the fine print, they take like one hundred dollars.

407
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:25,342
Scott: Yeah.

408
00:22:25,362 --> 00:22:26,578
Rym: You just sign away like your house.

409
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,081
Rym: Yeah.

410
00:22:27,101 --> 00:22:27,364
Scott: Who knows?

411
00:22:27,727 --> 00:22:28,980
Rym: So briefly, I do want to geek by it.

412
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:33,576
Rym: I bought the official Gameloft, you know, Android app that is Catan.

413
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,825
Rym: Settlers of Catan.

414
00:22:35,845 --> 00:22:38,000
Scott: I thought Microsoft owned the license for Catan.

415
00:22:38,281 --> 00:22:39,259
Scott: How does Gameloft make?

416
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:39,983
Rym: There's this whole.

417
00:22:40,003 --> 00:22:43,183
Rym: I'm trying to figure out how this doesn't have the Microsoft logo on it anywhere.

418
00:22:43,203 --> 00:22:44,579
Rym: No, it doesn't have any logos on it.

419
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,203
Scott: Really?

420
00:22:45,224 --> 00:22:46,740
Rym: It just says interesting.

421
00:22:47,961 --> 00:22:51,000
Rym: But basically what happened in the game, I bought the game and I've been playing it.

422
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:54,660
Rym: And it's basically just Settlers.

423
00:22:55,502 --> 00:22:56,639
Scott: What did you think it was going to be?

424
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,660
Rym: With some surprising limitations.

425
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:00,867
Scott: What are the limitations?

426
00:23:00,908 --> 00:23:02,220
Scott: I mean, it's Settlers.

427
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,840
Rym: You can't play it online with anyone.

428
00:23:05,572 --> 00:23:05,720
Scott: Ever?

429
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,503
Rym: You know, it's.

430
00:23:06,523 --> 00:23:09,060
Rym: you either play it locally, hot seat or with bots.

431
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:15,638
Scott: You know, Settlers on the iPhone uses like the game center and you can play it online or you can also do like local Wi-Fi.

432
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,300
Scott: If other people have iPhones, you can sit around playing games.

433
00:23:18,561 --> 00:23:19,260
Rym: You know, you can't do anything.

434
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:26,946
Scott: I don't know if you can do that specifically with Settlers because I've never really actually played German games on the iPhone, but I know there are games that use both of those features.

435
00:23:27,026 --> 00:23:28,540
Scott: In fact, Dixit had those features.

436
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,960
Rym: You can't do any of that shit with this.

437
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:34,119
Rym: It's basically just single player Settlers or maybe hot seat.

438
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,339
Rym: They'll get sick of the hot seat in like five minutes and quit because it's stupid.

439
00:23:38,423 --> 00:23:38,584
Rym: Yeah.

440
00:23:38,604 --> 00:23:42,360
Rym: And there's a lot of kind of microtransaction stuff in it.

441
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,140
Scott: Oh, what can there be for a microtransaction in Settlers?

442
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,089
Rym: They've got a campaign.

443
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:46,939
Rym: We got to pay for that.

444
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,460
Scott: What do you mean a campaign?

445
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,206
Rym: There's a campaign.

446
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,000
Scott: How could there be a campaign of Settlers?

447
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:51,683
Scott: There's a campaign.

448
00:23:51,703 --> 00:23:54,620
Scott: You have to play 10 games in a row and they play videos in between them?

449
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,626
Rym: There's a campaign.

450
00:23:56,292 --> 00:23:57,280
Scott: What is the campaign like?

451
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:57,887
Scott: Fuck if I know.

452
00:23:57,908 --> 00:23:58,579
Scott: I didn't buy it.

453
00:23:59,420 --> 00:23:59,863
Scott: Oh, right.

454
00:24:00,447 --> 00:24:01,111
Rym: There's also.

455
00:24:01,272 --> 00:24:01,795
Rym: you can get.

456
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:02,640
Rym: they've got seafarers.

457
00:24:02,981 --> 00:24:03,828
Rym: You can buy that.

458
00:24:04,231 --> 00:24:05,220
Scott: That makes that make sense.

459
00:24:05,501 --> 00:24:06,413
Scott: It makes sense.

460
00:24:06,433 --> 00:24:06,960
Scott: Cities and Knights.

461
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,679
Rym: They've got that's not in there yet.

462
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,740
Scott: Five and six player expansion.

463
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,700
Rym: They've got some alternate tile sets.

464
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,559
Rym: Some are free Settlers of Canaan, some not so free.

465
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,520
Scott: OK, that's that's makes sense.

466
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,212
Rym: Yeah, but all that aside, it's a pretty like.

467
00:24:18,232 --> 00:24:19,260
Rym: the game works pretty well.

468
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,110
Rym: The training mechanic.

469
00:24:20,191 --> 00:24:20,900
Rym: How's the interface?

470
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,030
Rym: It's actually really good.

471
00:24:22,111 --> 00:24:22,699
Rym: It just works.

472
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,980
Scott: And are the rules accurate?

473
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,360
Rym: The rules are accurate, though.

474
00:24:25,781 --> 00:24:30,240
Rym: They added some rules that I have been advocating for fucking ever.

475
00:24:30,561 --> 00:24:31,087
Scott: It's OK.

476
00:24:31,127 --> 00:24:32,279
Scott: So they changed the rules.

477
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:36,680
Rym: But you can play straight Settlers, but they have options like you can change.

478
00:24:37,282 --> 00:24:39,539
Rym: It has dice, which is just dice, you know, to do six.

479
00:24:40,101 --> 00:24:43,820
Rym: You can also use something they call the stack, which is the thing I always recommend for games like this.

480
00:24:44,641 --> 00:24:48,840
Rym: Make a deck of 2D6, maybe two decks of it.

481
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,207
Rym: So there's two of each of the odds.

482
00:24:50,247 --> 00:24:52,600
Rym: be the same to guarantee fairness.

483
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,473
Scott: Yeah, yeah, that's that's something we can't believe.

484
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,400
Scott: that they thought of that.

485
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,479
Rym: It allows you to really do interesting stuff.

486
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,200
Rym: Strategy wise, like seven has been coming up a whole bunch.

487
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,740
Rym: There's only so many sevens before it resets.

488
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,220
Scott: Yeah, that people don't realize this, but or two is going to get rolled.

489
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,735
Scott: Imagine if you have 2D6, right?

490
00:25:11,362 --> 00:25:14,200
Scott: Any number could come up two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

491
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,420
Scott: And you know, the odds seven is the most likely two and twelve are the least likely.

492
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:17,721
Scott: Right.

493
00:25:17,742 --> 00:25:18,815
Rym: Well, you better if you're a gamer.

494
00:25:18,997 --> 00:25:19,200
Rym: Right.

495
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,525
Scott: But what if you had a deck of cards?

496
00:25:21,967 --> 00:25:25,820
Scott: and in that deck of cards, you had all the numbers two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

497
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,078
Scott: And the deck was mostly sevens.

498
00:25:27,681 --> 00:25:29,613
Scott: You know, it would have the same proportion as 2D6.

499
00:25:31,381 --> 00:25:35,640
Scott: But there's a difference here, even though the odds of any number coming up are the same.

500
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:39,480
Scott: The fact is, when you have a deck, you're going through the deck exactly once.

501
00:25:39,561 --> 00:25:41,780
Scott: Which means there is a two in the deck somewhere.

502
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,600
Scott: It's going to show up at some point.

503
00:25:43,901 --> 00:25:47,300
Scott: Rolling 2D6, it could be just seven every time forever.

504
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,186
Scott: That's possible.

505
00:25:48,267 --> 00:25:49,315
Rym: Now, the thing is, you have to.

506
00:25:49,335 --> 00:25:49,980
Rym: you can tweak it.

507
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,825
Rym: It's kind of like blackjack.

508
00:25:50,865 --> 00:25:52,012
Rym: How many decks do you use?

509
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:53,240
Rym: by expanding the deck?

510
00:25:53,461 --> 00:25:56,860
Rym: You can make it to where it's less deterministic as the number of decks you use.

511
00:25:57,081 --> 00:26:01,060
Scott: You know, the smallest deck that had the same proportion would have exactly one, two and one.

512
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,220
Rym: You could count cards and being like four is going to get rolled three more times in the next five rounds.

513
00:26:05,661 --> 00:26:05,902
Scott: Right.

514
00:26:05,942 --> 00:26:09,460
Scott: So it's like if you're counting the cards, you know, the rest of the deck is all five.

515
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,880
Rym: Now they have another option, which is actually really interesting.

516
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,480
Rym: It's another thing that I kind of was expecting, though they did it slightly differently from how I would do it.

517
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,879
Rym: They call it stack five.

518
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,323
Rym: You have a deck.

519
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:24,080
Rym: Five values are randomly and secretly removed.

520
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,580
Scott: Oh, just period.

521
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,121
Rym: Yeah.

522
00:26:26,323 --> 00:26:28,100
Scott: So it could be two might never get rolled.

523
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,100
Scott: It could be twos, sevens, tens.

524
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,117
Scott: So maybe sevens.

525
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:31,907
Rym: It could be five.

526
00:26:31,947 --> 00:26:32,899
Rym: sevens got removed.

527
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,799
Scott: Oh, five five cards.

528
00:26:35,743 --> 00:26:38,200
Scott: Oh, I thought it was five numbers are removed.

529
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:39,860
Rym: No, that's kind of crazy.

530
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,297
Scott: This deck has no threes.

531
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:46,240
Rym: No, it also has options.

532
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:51,740
Rym: Like you can start with cities and you can start with a lot of the kind of house rules that people will start with for like abbreviated games.

533
00:26:52,103 --> 00:26:54,060
Rym: You can increase the victory point requirements.

534
00:26:54,262 --> 00:26:56,479
Rym: And there's a bunch of kind of like fiddly things.

535
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,127
Scott: Not a fan.

536
00:26:57,249 --> 00:26:57,819
Scott: They're all there.

537
00:26:58,041 --> 00:26:58,999
Scott: I'm only a fan of the stack.

538
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,842
Rym: So the

539
00:26:59,862 --> 00:26:59,903
Rym: A.I.,

540
00:27:00,866 --> 00:27:02,231
Rym: I've noticed that it's retarded.

541
00:27:02,391 --> 00:27:04,720
Rym: if I like uninstall and reinstall the game and play.

542
00:27:05,263 --> 00:27:06,980
Rym: I always win the first game.

543
00:27:07,262 --> 00:27:09,420
Rym: I think the game has a slight learning.

544
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:10,860
Rym: I think it does.

545
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:19,340
Scott: I think it cheats and pretty much let's try to play the first game and just try to be a moron, like just build your settlements far away from each other.

546
00:27:19,741 --> 00:27:22,619
Scott: Don't just hold on to a zillion cards and hardly ever build anything.

547
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,080
Scott: Build like just a bunch of disconnected roads all over the place.

548
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,222
Rym: But after that, the

549
00:27:26,322 --> 00:27:26,783
Rym: A.I.,

550
00:27:26,803 --> 00:27:33,737
Rym: I mean, it's not that hard to make a perfect day for settlers, but the problem is it tends to hold on to a lot of cards like.

551
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,420
Rym: it'll sit there with like 20 resources.

552
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,040
Rym: And then the robber gets rolled like, great, dude, good game, good job.

553
00:27:41,121 --> 00:27:44,600
Rym: Or it'll do stuff like you'll see it in like trade.

554
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,122
Rym: It'll.

555
00:27:45,142 --> 00:27:47,440
Rym: it'll surprisingly not trade that often.

556
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,579
Rym: It kind of trades semi optimally.

557
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,007
Scott: And it won't trading.

558
00:27:51,047 --> 00:27:52,437
Scott: just doesn't make sense when you have A.I.

559
00:27:53,101 --> 00:27:54,140
Rym: and it won't trade with the front runner.

560
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:54,825
Scott: It doesn't work.

561
00:27:54,986 --> 00:27:56,099
Rym: Now it won't trade with the front runner.

562
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:07,640
Rym: It works pretty well, but it really, really picks on the human player to probably make the game more playable without just always winning.

563
00:28:08,141 --> 00:28:13,199
Rym: It'll rob the human player pretty much constantly, even when the human player is in like third, fourth place.

564
00:28:14,705 --> 00:28:15,679
Scott: So it always robs you.

565
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,800
Rym: It seems to always go after me like pretty hardcore, even when I am not winning.

566
00:28:21,923 --> 00:28:22,606
Rym: All right, that's it.

567
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:25,020
Rym: It's a pretty solid implementation, but don't be fooled.

568
00:28:25,661 --> 00:28:31,780
Rym: It doesn't have any form of non-local multiplayer, thus making it kind of useless.

569
00:28:32,822 --> 00:28:35,439
Scott: I would suggest just buying a settler's set.

570
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,280
Rym: I would also suggest that they're not that expensive or there you could.

571
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,139
Rym: There's a bunch of places to play settlers online with people kind of bootleggy or free.

572
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:43,702
Scott: Yeah.

573
00:28:43,743 --> 00:28:44,193
Scott: Wasn't there enough?

574
00:28:44,275 --> 00:28:44,520
Scott: Isn't there?

575
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,520
Scott: And you're going to play the Xbox, too, with people.

576
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,084
Scott: Yeah.

577
00:28:47,327 --> 00:28:47,732
Scott: Do that.

578
00:28:47,752 --> 00:28:48,360
Scott: Yeah.

579
00:28:49,502 --> 00:28:52,120
Rym: Oh, so I got to say I was doing a quick look because I didn't realize who'd made it.

580
00:28:52,221 --> 00:28:53,140
Rym: So I was like, oh, Gameloft.

581
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:53,824
Rym: But then I looked.

582
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:56,480
Rym: Gameloft has that other game, The Settlers on Droid.

583
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,719
Scott: Well, The Settlers is not Catan.

584
00:28:59,520 --> 00:28:59,641
Rym: I know.

585
00:28:59,662 --> 00:29:01,159
Rym: That's what I just said.

586
00:29:02,043 --> 00:29:03,080
Rym: Because I was looking through the Google.

587
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,860
Rym: This was made by some company I've never heard of, actually, but it's the official one.

588
00:29:07,141 --> 00:29:08,417
Rym: So it's some German company, it looks like.

589
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:09,381
Scott: OK.

590
00:29:09,402 --> 00:29:09,916
Scott: Yeah.

591
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:14,920
Rym: Anyway, so things of the day, what do you got?

592
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:20,120
Scott: So here's a video and this is a cosplay that requires video and it's a cosplay, by the way.

593
00:29:20,781 --> 00:29:25,339
Scott: This is the most genius cosplay I've seen in a long time, perhaps a year or two.

594
00:29:25,721 --> 00:29:26,365
Scott: And that's all I got.

595
00:29:26,405 --> 00:29:29,100
Scott: And you just watch it and that's all there is to it.

596
00:29:29,281 --> 00:29:29,606
Rym: All right.

597
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:30,440
Rym: Well, I got my own.

598
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,560
Rym: It's a meme that many of you may not have run into, but it's surprisingly popular.

599
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:42,399
Rym: There's like six hundred and something thousand views on the video here and there's a ton of remixes and it's advice that the Internet really needs.

600
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,258
Rym: It's OK to not like things.

601
00:29:46,241 --> 00:29:47,699
Rym: Yeah, it's kind of stuck in my head.

602
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,386
Rym: The little song.

603
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:49,418
Rym: OK, that's it.

604
00:29:49,761 --> 00:29:49,984
Rym: All right.

605
00:29:50,146 --> 00:29:50,511
Rym: It's a thing.

606
00:29:50,531 --> 00:29:51,099
Rym: You should watch it.

607
00:29:51,421 --> 00:29:52,275
Scott: We got a metamoment.

608
00:29:52,295 --> 00:29:52,519
Scott: situation.

609
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:53,980
Rym: We do have a metamoment.

610
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:54,887
Scott: We got a Twitter.

611
00:29:54,988 --> 00:29:55,777
Scott: Twitter.com/GeekNights.

612
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:56,444
Scott: Yes.

613
00:29:56,485 --> 00:29:57,140
Scott: We got a Facebook.

614
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:02,525
Scott: Facebook.com/FrontRowCrew because GeekNights is like occupied by the interest of Facebook.

615
00:30:02,666 --> 00:30:05,660
Scott: Anyway, we got we got a website.

616
00:30:05,761 --> 00:30:07,579
Scott: We got a website, frontrowcrew.com.

617
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,379
Scott: It has a forum at forum.frontrowcrew.com.

618
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,640
Rym: We have two YouTube channels.

619
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,999
Rym: The GeekNights one, which is not updating for reasons I don't want to get into.

620
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,318
Scott: Don't just don't worry about which channel to go on YouTube.

621
00:30:16,702 --> 00:30:18,500
Scott: Just go to YouTube and search for GeekNights or whatever.

622
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:26,419
Rym: But really, the GeekNights Rym one is the official YouTube channel of me, which happens to have a lot of our panels as I'm slowly uploading them.

623
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:31,036
Scott: You want to go and read the book club book, which is the ear, the eye, the arm.

624
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:32,641
Rym: Yep.

625
00:30:32,661 --> 00:30:36,440
Scott: The hand, the foot, not the hand, the ear, the eye and the arm.

626
00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:38,560
Scott: Did you ever put up the book club?

627
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,218
Rym: I was actually going to finish that tonight and get it up.

628
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,484
Scott: All right.

629
00:30:41,885 --> 00:30:49,956
Rym: We are going to be at the Penny Arcade Expo this year in Seattle doing a panel Discover the Forgotten Masters at noon on Saturday at 6 p.m.

630
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,803
Rym: on Saturday.

631
00:30:51,884 --> 00:30:56,120
Rym: We will also be doing in the new workshop area for tabletop.

632
00:30:56,302 --> 00:30:58,180
Rym: I still have to sort out the exact name of this area.

633
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:06,180
Rym: We will be teaching people how to play Spotted, Seven Wonders, Carcassonne and a Game To Be Determined.

634
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:12,120
Scott: This Friday at seven o'clock is Nerd NYC board game night at Think Coffee, New York City.

635
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:12,842
Rym: We will be there.

636
00:31:13,423 --> 00:31:18,740
Scott: Saturday the 13th, which is this Saturday, is the second summer streets.

637
00:31:18,881 --> 00:31:20,079
Scott: from seven to one p.m.

638
00:31:20,621 --> 00:31:24,116
Scott: There's basically the roads are closed to cars between Central Park and 72nd Street.

639
00:31:24,136 --> 00:31:30,940
Rym: to Friday, the 19th, not this Friday, but next Friday is the JOCO mini cruise in New York.

640
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:37,003
Scott: So if you go to that and you go to PAX, it's double JOCO one one one one week and one the next week.

641
00:31:37,123 --> 00:31:39,800
Rym: And also we will be on this little mini New York cruise.

642
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,220
Rym: It's like a three or four hour thing.

643
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,838
Scott: That way I won't have to see JOCO the next week.

644
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,380
Scott: Yeah, I can go play games instead of going to a concert.

645
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:49,468
Rym: So if you want to hang out with us, I mean, other than the concert, it's just food and drinks hanging out.

646
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:50,660
Scott: Plus, it's a concert on a boat.

647
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:54,240
Scott: So it's not like a typical concert where you sit there listening to music the whole time.

648
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,259
Scott: You know, you're on a boat, so you go and you hang out on the deck.

649
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,447
Scott: You go eat some food.

650
00:31:57,467 --> 00:31:58,660
Rym: I like being on a boat.

651
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,617
Scott: You go and listen to some music, you know.

652
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:06,723
Rym: I swear to God, if he doesn't do a cover of I'm on a boat on the boat, I'll be very disappointed.

653
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,958
Scott: And then the third summer streets is the day after that.

654
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:21,648
Rym: Been a while since we've talked about some tabletop in depth, so I figured it'd be a good opportunity to cover a couple of games.

655
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,350
Rym: People are looking for new stuff to play.

656
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,890
Rym: You've already bought every game we've ever recommended.

657
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:27,114
Rym: You haven't should.

658
00:32:27,597 --> 00:32:32,790
Scott: Well, these are two actually somewhat old games that we just hadn't really played a lot until recently there.

659
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:33,808
Scott: Well, there's somewhat old.

660
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:36,990
Scott: So let's have a reefing counter, which is from 2004.

661
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,730
Scott: So Scott played this at what?

662
00:32:39,732 --> 00:32:46,393
Scott: No, I played this online at spiel by spiel by web dot com, which I think you can still do.

663
00:32:46,413 --> 00:32:49,369
Scott: S.P.I.E.L Yup, spiel by web.

664
00:32:49,952 --> 00:32:51,542
Rym: I was playing.

665
00:32:51,723 --> 00:32:52,870
Rym: I was playing Hacienda there.

666
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:58,433
Scott: Yeah, that website has Hacienda, Hoity Toity, Reef Encounter, Santiago, Tikal, Wallenstein and bus.

667
00:32:59,216 --> 00:33:02,673
Scott: And it's actually a pretty good interface and it just emails you when it's your turn.

668
00:33:02,734 --> 00:33:03,990
Scott: You go to the website, you take your turn.

669
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:08,151
Scott: So I played and learned how to play reefing counter there, but I didn't play it that much.

670
00:33:08,894 --> 00:33:12,610
Scott: And I kept wanting to buy the game and I just didn't until eventually.

671
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:13,333
Scott: I'm like, you know what?

672
00:33:13,354 --> 00:33:16,353
Scott: I just fucking buy it because it's really cute little wooden shrimp.

673
00:33:16,454 --> 00:33:16,939
Rym: Oh, my God.

674
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:17,990
Rym: The little googly eyes.

675
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:20,570
Scott: There's little wooden shrimps in this game that have googly eyes.

676
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:23,310
Scott: They are the cutest game piece I've ever seen.

677
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:26,530
Rym: You guys don't understand because I never played this game online to Scott did.

678
00:33:26,611 --> 00:33:28,670
Rym: And he kept telling me about it and he kept coming up.

679
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:31,310
Rym: And every now and then we'd be like, blah, blah, blah, board game.

680
00:33:31,371 --> 00:33:33,590
Rym: He's like, oh, I should get reef encounter.

681
00:33:34,014 --> 00:33:35,128
Rym: It has the best shrimp.

682
00:33:36,313 --> 00:33:36,656
Scott: It does.

683
00:33:36,676 --> 00:33:37,525
Rym: And you put him in your.

684
00:33:37,565 --> 00:33:38,030
Rym: what's the fish?

685
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:38,819
Rym: The parrotfish?

686
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,410
Scott: The parrotfish.

687
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:40,092
Scott: Yeah.

688
00:33:40,112 --> 00:33:40,313
Scott: Yeah.

689
00:33:41,037 --> 00:33:41,479
Rym: It's not.

690
00:33:41,499 --> 00:33:43,430
Rym: you know what I what I think what I like about it.

691
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:44,521
Rym: And we can explain what.

692
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:45,208
Rym: what goes on.

693
00:33:45,811 --> 00:33:53,949
Rym: It is a lot of mechanics and they're all pretty distinct from similar looking or similar feeling games like it.

694
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:59,250
Rym: It's kind of in a space on its own in terms of German style euro game.

695
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,030
Scott: Yeah, I don't I can't think of another game.

696
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,169
Scott: It's like, you know, a lot of games.

697
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:06,914
Scott: You can be like, oh, yeah, you know, Le Havre, that's Kalis plus Agricola or, you know, whatever.

698
00:34:07,238 --> 00:34:08,208
Scott: You know, that's what it is.

699
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:08,531
Rym: Yeah.

700
00:34:08,853 --> 00:34:11,989
Scott: But you look at, you know, reef encounter like, well, what is that?

701
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,014
Scott: Well, it's got some sort.

702
00:34:13,076 --> 00:34:16,257
Scott: it's got sort of an action system, sort of like to call, but there's no action points.

703
00:34:16,277 --> 00:34:17,810
Scott: You can just go nuts on your actions.

704
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:18,594
Rym: Yeah, I love this.

705
00:34:18,635 --> 00:34:19,522
Rym: You've got you can take.

706
00:34:19,542 --> 00:34:20,570
Rym: you know, you've got one action.

707
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:23,170
Rym: You can take that infinity time.

708
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:25,661
Scott: Yeah, basically there's like on your turn, there's all.

709
00:34:25,681 --> 00:34:27,877
Scott: this is chart that shows all the actions you can do.

710
00:34:27,897 --> 00:34:29,469
Scott: So there's one action you have to do.

711
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,889
Scott: You can do it at most once at the beginning of your turn.

712
00:34:32,251 --> 00:34:36,389
Scott: There's another action you must do once at the end of your turn, everything in the middle.

713
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:41,873
Scott: There's like two actions or three or two or three actions you can do at most once at any time during your turn.

714
00:34:42,496 --> 00:34:47,210
Scott: There's a bunch of other actions that you can do as many times as you are able to during your turn in any order.

715
00:34:47,612 --> 00:34:53,078
Scott: And then this action number five, which you can do infinity times any time during your turn, even in the middle of another action,

716
00:34:53,500 --> 00:35:01,769
Rym: you'll find that players will constantly make the joke of they'll move one of their algaes like one of their one of their shrimps, an infinite number of times.

717
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:04,629
Rym: It stops getting funny really quick.

718
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,770
Rym: Yeah, do it anyway, especially if Scott's playing.

719
00:35:07,631 --> 00:35:12,695
Scott: But the point is, you have a ridiculous number of things you can do on your turn in different combinations.

720
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:15,712
Scott: And you think, oh, you must be able to just win the game in one stroke.

721
00:35:15,732 --> 00:35:18,470
Scott: Well, not really, because you're so limited in your resource.

722
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:26,990
Scott: It's really, you know, a lot of games say the resource management games, which means collect a bunch of resources and then spend them wisely.

723
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:30,250
Rym: But rarely are those actually like the driving force of the game.

724
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:35,330
Scott: This isn't just, you know, buy a get as many resources as possible and spend them wisely.

725
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:36,053
Scott: It's it's.

726
00:35:36,374 --> 00:35:40,592
Scott: there's all sorts of different resources and they all do all sorts of different things.

727
00:35:40,632 --> 00:35:44,396
Scott: But the only thing that matters in terms of winning is getting corals in your parrotfish.

728
00:35:44,416 --> 00:35:45,710
Rym: That's all you want, right?

729
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:49,170
Scott: So the key in this game is you want to get corals in the parrotfish.

730
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:49,611
Rym: That's it.

731
00:35:49,712 --> 00:35:56,990
Scott: So the other game, but you're going to get corals of different colors and you only get to put things in the fish at most four times.

732
00:35:57,691 --> 00:36:04,149
Scott: So at the end of the game, your parrotfish, maybe you ate three shrimps, you got five white, two yellow and a pink in there.

733
00:36:04,531 --> 00:36:12,650
Scott: Well, each tile could be worth anywhere from one to five points, depending on how you managed the open seaboard.

734
00:36:12,791 --> 00:36:16,570
Rym: Now, the open seaboard has this cool thing in that it in turn controls multiple things.

735
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:18,049
Rym: It controls the points at the end of the game.

736
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:22,370
Rym: It also controls which algae can eat other corals, can eat other corals.

737
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:22,811
Scott: Right.

738
00:36:22,851 --> 00:36:25,669
Scott: So let's say that on the open seaboard, white is beating orange.

739
00:36:25,911 --> 00:36:33,070
Scott: That means that white at the end of the game, a white coral will be worth one more point and an orange will be worth one less point.

740
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:40,470
Scott: It also means that right now during the game at this moment in time, a white coral can consume an orange coral, but not vice versa.

741
00:36:40,651 --> 00:36:45,491
Rym: One thing you can spend actions on and resources is locking those fuckers in or flipping them.

742
00:36:45,612 --> 00:36:52,911
Scott: So you could flip the orange to be stronger than the white or you could lock it in so that orange will never, ever be stronger than white ever again for the rest of the game.

743
00:36:52,931 --> 00:36:56,250
Rym: But the flipping itself is slightly complex, kind of like a Rubik's Cube.

744
00:36:56,571 --> 00:36:58,230
Rym: Yeah, it's like you need to move other things.

745
00:36:58,330 --> 00:36:59,094
Scott: You want to flip it.

746
00:36:59,114 --> 00:37:04,010
Scott: Well, that means that you need a consumed polyp tile to turn into an algae cylinder.

747
00:37:04,711 --> 00:37:08,210
Rym: It's like, oh, my God, it's really about timing and what other opponents are doing.

748
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:14,370
Rym: Like, say it's early in the game and I eat a whole bunch of white and I lock in white to be worth a ton of points at the end of the game.

749
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:18,454
Rym: Everyone else is just going to get a whole bunch of white now, too, because they know it's worth a lot.

750
00:37:18,796 --> 00:37:20,930
Scott: Yeah, and they've got a whole rest of the game to get white.

751
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:24,450
Rym: I've also locked white in as being powerful, so it's kind of pointless at that point.

752
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:30,870
Scott: So it's really, well, actually, on the other hand, it would be really easy to consume other colors with white.

753
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:38,309
Scott: But because you've locked in white as being powerful, it's hard to consume white, which would make it harder to get white larva cubes.

754
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:41,430
Rym: But there are other ways to get larva cubes.

755
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:48,629
Scott: There are, but it would still be hard to play because the competition for the white larva cube in the open seaboard would be very high.

756
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:51,450
Scott: So it wouldn't come with a lot of polyp tiles.

757
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:52,658
Rym: It's very easy.

758
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,890
Scott: This game is so strange.

759
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:57,810
Scott: It's got so many different bits all over the place and it's just like, what the fuck?

760
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:58,093
Scott: You're not.

761
00:37:58,113 --> 00:37:59,769
Scott: I'm not going to be able to teach you this game now.

762
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:02,130
Scott: You're not going to understand how the game works on the podcast.

763
00:38:02,532 --> 00:38:07,629
Scott: The only way I recommend going to spiel by web, reading the rules, that's the only way you're going to understand it.

764
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:11,709
Rym: But it is a game the way we used to describe Puerto Rico to people who weren't familiar with this kind of game.

765
00:38:12,013 --> 00:38:17,590
Rym: But this is like that to a T. You've got this giant mixer board in front of you with all these sliders.

766
00:38:18,072 --> 00:38:20,750
Rym: You move one a little bit and all the other ones move all over the place.

767
00:38:20,971 --> 00:38:22,550
Scott: You got all sorts of just crazy shit.

768
00:38:22,951 --> 00:38:25,909
Scott: There's this polyp tile, shrimp is free.

769
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,990
Scott: What's the free token space?

770
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,368
Rym: Oh, I don't remember what it was.

771
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:31,090
Scott: It's like the free stone.

772
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:31,631
Scott: And you got.

773
00:38:32,013 --> 00:38:41,110
Scott: you got the ocean tiles, you got the ocean seaport, you got a pair of fish, you got alga cylinders, larva cubes, consumed polyp tiles.

774
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:45,310
Rym: I think this game has my favorite set of proper nouns of any board game I've played.

775
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:45,711
Scott: Yeah.

776
00:38:45,771 --> 00:38:57,310
Scott: And it's weird because while they actually made a really good game, even though this seemed it's one of those, you know, people always play German board games, even less complicated ones and they seem complicated.

777
00:38:57,772 --> 00:38:58,708
Scott: They get afraid of them.

778
00:38:59,232 --> 00:38:59,655
Scott: But what?

779
00:38:59,735 --> 00:39:02,350
Scott: and even when you're reading the rules, it'll still be complicated.

780
00:39:02,451 --> 00:39:05,330
Scott: But once you actually play, all the complexity just goes away.

781
00:39:05,672 --> 00:39:07,410
Scott: It's like, oh, this isn't actually complex.

782
00:39:07,591 --> 00:39:10,830
Scott: It just seems complex right up until the moment you actually take your turn.

783
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:17,469
Scott: Yeah, because you don't actually get to do all that ridiculous shit in one turn because you don't have the stuff to do all that ridiculous shit in one turn.

784
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:21,050
Scott: So Reef Encounter is highly recommended.

785
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:22,794
Rym: It's great fun.

786
00:39:22,914 --> 00:39:24,300
Scott: And just there is an expansion.

787
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:29,510
Rym: I have not played just because it's so different from a lot of the games you've already got.

788
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:34,310
Scott: And actually does a pretty good job of simulating, you know, or teaching you about a real coral reef.

789
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:40,750
Rym: It's a surprisingly educational game that actually does pretty accurately incorporate the reality of what it's teaching.

790
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:41,413
Scott: But I'm not.

791
00:39:41,433 --> 00:39:46,250
Scott: the problem is in order to learn anything about coral reefs, you'd actually have to be thinking about learning about coral reefs while playing.

792
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,215
Scott: I'm thinking about winning.

793
00:39:47,315 --> 00:39:50,356
Scott: So I don't really learn anything, but I already know how coral reef works.

794
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,409
Rym: So how do you now?

795
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:51,811
Rym: Yep.

796
00:39:52,074 --> 00:39:53,246
Rym: Where's the parrot fish come in?

797
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:56,089
Rym: He how about the free algae space?

798
00:39:58,632 --> 00:40:02,170
Rym: So the other like this is a lighter game, but we played this game.

799
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:03,470
Rym: We kept forgetting what it was called.

800
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:10,090
Scott: Alex seems to be really good at going to board game libraries and conventions, finding the good game that none of us noticed.

801
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:10,451
Scott: Yeah.

802
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:11,629
Scott: First it was battle line.

803
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:15,149
Scott: Now at ConnectiCon, he went to the library and he got Toluva.

804
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:15,870
Rym: Yep.

805
00:40:16,552 --> 00:40:17,255
Rym: And it's.

806
00:40:17,495 --> 00:40:22,490
Rym: it reminded me right away of this other game, you know, Tikal and Mexico.

807
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,390
Rym: Well, Java was the third of those three games.

808
00:40:25,491 --> 00:40:27,950
Scott: It reminded me more of what's it called?

809
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:30,550
Scott: Samurai, but the the Reiner Knizia Samurai.

810
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:30,952
Rym: Oh, yeah.

811
00:40:30,972 --> 00:40:32,529
Rym: There's like ten games called Samurai.

812
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:32,932
Scott: Yeah.

813
00:40:32,952 --> 00:40:33,670
Scott: But the one with the Buddha.

814
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:34,559
Rym: Yeah, the one with the Buddha.

815
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,290
Rym: That's a really good game.

816
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:35,960
Rym: I should say I can get it.

817
00:40:36,143 --> 00:40:36,530
Scott: Go get it.

818
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:37,260
Scott: You can get it easily.

819
00:40:37,524 --> 00:40:37,890
Rym: But anyway.

820
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:41,710
Rym: But it also reminded me of Java because it had the hex tiles that stack.

821
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:42,114
Scott: Yep.

822
00:40:42,155 --> 00:40:42,709
Scott: Stacking hexes.

823
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,337
Rym: In three dimensions.

824
00:40:44,397 --> 00:40:47,170
Rym: We should probably do a show on that trilogy of Mexico Tikal and Java at.

825
00:40:47,593 --> 00:40:49,610
Scott: We should get three games named Samurai.

826
00:40:50,493 --> 00:40:50,878
Rym: Oh, yeah.

827
00:40:50,999 --> 00:40:51,950
Rym: Do a show on Samurai.

828
00:40:52,111 --> 00:40:52,372
Scott: Yes.

829
00:40:52,473 --> 00:40:55,650
Scott: Anyway, but Toluva is a game, if you didn't know, it's about volcanoes.

830
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:59,610
Scott: So every hex tile has three spots, three hexes on it.

831
00:40:59,771 --> 00:41:01,230
Scott: And one of those hexes is a volcano.

832
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:01,650
Rym: Yep.

833
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:04,670
Rym: And it's like and the rest of it is like jungles or clearings or rocks.

834
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:08,350
Scott: So on your turn or whatever, on your turn, it's sort of like Carcassonne, right?

835
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:09,849
Scott: Or were the tiles bigger than that?

836
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:10,754
Scott: I'm trying to remember.

837
00:41:10,834 --> 00:41:14,110
Rym: They're three tile and you play a tile just like Carcassonne.

838
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:16,364
Rym: And then you must build something.

839
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:21,410
Rym: And there's three kinds of things to build temples, towers and huts, just like Carcassonne.

840
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:33,290
Rym: So the way it works, only three kinds of meeples, is by default, you've got these, you know, there's like 12 temples, eight towers and like 80 huts in the game.

841
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:35,328
Rym: And you each have your own set of them.

842
00:41:36,371 --> 00:41:40,290
Scott: The game, I think each person has two towers, three temples and a fistful of huts.

843
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:42,710
Rym: But the way the game goes is there's 48 volcano tiles.

844
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:45,790
Rym: And every time, you know, you draw a volcano tile, you play it and you play your stuff down.

845
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:47,150
Rym: You must play a building.

846
00:41:48,011 --> 00:41:54,890
Rym: And when we run out of stuff, like when there's no more tiles and the game is over, then whoever has the most temples wins.

847
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:58,089
Rym: But wait a minute, temples are in the middle of that set of three.

848
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:00,890
Rym: Like there's more temples than towers per player.

849
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:02,430
Scott: Yeah, there's three temples and two towers.

850
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:06,770
Rym: So, yeah, if you're tied on temples, then the tiebreaker is towers.

851
00:42:06,931 --> 00:42:09,009
Rym: If you're tied on towers, the tiebreaker is huts.

852
00:42:09,431 --> 00:42:09,733
Rym: All right.

853
00:42:10,256 --> 00:42:12,510
Rym: But the game rarely ends that way.

854
00:42:13,051 --> 00:42:13,354
Scott: I don't know.

855
00:42:13,394 --> 00:42:14,929
Scott: It ended that way a couple of times when you played it.

856
00:42:15,411 --> 00:42:22,330
Rym: If any player gets all of two kinds of his buildings out on the board, he immediately wins.

857
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:25,210
Scott: So you get both towers and all three temples on the board.

858
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:26,750
Scott: You immediately win at that instant.

859
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:34,110
Scott: If you get all your huts and all your temples or all your huts and all your towers on the board at the same time, you immediately instantly win.

860
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:39,289
Rym: So think about it, because, you know, you want to go for the temples if you think the game's going to get all the way to the end.

861
00:42:39,731 --> 00:42:45,049
Rym: But if you want to end the game early, you got to go kind of for the towers first, because they're the hardest to place and there's the fewest of them.

862
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:45,550
Rym: Yeah.

863
00:42:46,414 --> 00:42:52,070
Rym: Now, the other great part about this game is that when you play the volcano tiles, they're motherfucking volcano.

864
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:54,110
Rym: So you just play them on top of other people's shit.

865
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:58,230
Scott: Well, you can only play them on top if they line up with an existing volcano.

866
00:42:58,611 --> 00:42:58,853
Scott: Right.

867
00:42:59,094 --> 00:43:01,810
Scott: And they're not lining up with a tile directly.

868
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:04,290
Scott: So you can't just stack tiles straight up.

869
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:06,070
Scott: You have to stack them sort of at angles.

870
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,890
Rym: The lava always comes out of different directions.

871
00:43:08,194 --> 00:43:09,350
Rym: And there's a fiddly rule.

872
00:43:09,691 --> 00:43:14,370
Rym: You cannot volcano something that would completely destroy a player's settlement.

873
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:16,469
Rym: So you can't just wipe someone off the board.

874
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:19,870
Scott: But you can destroy some stuff, including your own stuff with them.

875
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,670
Scott: You just can't destroy an entire settlement.

876
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:21,970
Rym: Yep.

877
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:22,614
Rym: So you can't.

878
00:43:22,695 --> 00:43:29,530
Rym: But it means you can stick one little hut somewhere and that hut might prevent people from volcanoing things that you don't want them to volcano.

879
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:30,072
Scott: Exactly.

880
00:43:30,092 --> 00:43:36,329
Scott: Because if there's only one hut all by itself, volcanoing it would destroy an entire settlement, meaning no one can volcano that spot now.

881
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:40,076
Rym: Now, the cool thing is that there's different rules like, you know, the game stacks up.

882
00:43:40,156 --> 00:43:42,290
Rym: It's three dimensional as the tiles get on top of each other.

883
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:44,170
Rym: You're volcanoing while you're expanding outward.

884
00:43:44,651 --> 00:43:46,929
Rym: Towers can only go on places that are three or higher.

885
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:47,412
Scott: Yep.

886
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:50,590
Rym: Temples can only go on already large settlements.

887
00:43:51,111 --> 00:44:04,630
Rym: And if you expand a settlement with huts, every space that you build into in that round based on like what's on the tiles, you get one settlement, one hut in that tile space per level.

888
00:44:04,751 --> 00:44:05,599
Rym: So it's four high.

889
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,690
Rym: You get four fuckers.

890
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:06,891
Rym: Yeah.

891
00:44:06,951 --> 00:44:14,230
Scott: If you can somehow expand your settlement using the expand maneuver onto a very tall space, you can play a ton of huts very quickly.

892
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:19,370
Rym: The end result is that it's a chaotic and fiddly strategic game.

893
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:24,969
Scott: You basically have to be constantly on the lookout for everyone's stuff, thinking what move they're going to make.

894
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:27,002
Scott: You know, oh, he has the opportunity to build a tower.

895
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:28,009
Scott: How can I block it?

896
00:44:28,371 --> 00:44:29,803
Scott: He has the opportunity to build a temple.

897
00:44:29,843 --> 00:44:30,650
Scott: How can I block it?

898
00:44:31,092 --> 00:44:33,390
Scott: I need to make an opportunity for myself to build a temple.

899
00:44:33,832 --> 00:44:35,390
Scott: Where can I do it without getting blocked?

900
00:44:35,591 --> 00:44:45,329
Rym: It's very difficult to formulate coherent strategies just because the act of placing volcanoes is so disruptive to the board and one gets played every turn.

901
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:49,738
Scott: The other thing, though, is like you need to play something on your turn, no matter what.

902
00:44:49,941 --> 00:44:50,730
Rym: Yes, that's the third.

903
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:51,868
Scott: Otherwise, you just lose.

904
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:55,869
Rym: So the game ends when you run out of tiles and then it's just, you know, whoever has the most of each thing.

905
00:44:56,870 --> 00:45:01,368
Rym: The game also ends if someone wins by getting two of their three sets of buildings out there.

906
00:45:02,192 --> 00:45:05,970
Rym: An individual player is eliminated if on their turn they cannot play.

907
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:08,930
Rym: So you might think, I'm just going to get all my huts out there.

908
00:45:09,591 --> 00:45:12,810
Rym: Say you get all your huts out there and you don't have a place.

909
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:14,422
Rym: You can play a valid tower or tell up.

910
00:45:14,442 --> 00:45:14,744
Rym: You're done.

911
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:15,450
Rym: Game over.

912
00:45:15,752 --> 00:45:16,649
Rym: Yeah, you're just kicked out.

913
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:21,670
Scott: So that's the thing is that it might be really easy to play a ton of huts or to, you know, something like that.

914
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:24,670
Scott: But the hut, you can almost always on your turn play a hut.

915
00:45:25,111 --> 00:45:33,750
Scott: So you need to always hold on to a few huts because if you run out of them, it's very, you know, it's very likely that on your turn you won't be able to play a temple or a tower and you'll just lose.

916
00:45:34,293 --> 00:45:36,590
Scott: So but it's so easy to play so many huts.

917
00:45:37,012 --> 00:45:38,503
Scott: You might accidentally play them all.

918
00:45:38,624 --> 00:45:39,370
Scott: You have none left.

919
00:45:39,431 --> 00:45:40,088
Scott: You'll take a turn.

920
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:42,410
Scott: You won't be able to use a temple or a tower and you lose.

921
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:45,183
Rym: And I mean, there's not that much else to say.

922
00:45:45,223 --> 00:45:45,870
Rym: It's a fun game.

923
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:46,940
Scott: I'd only recommend it.

924
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,670
Scott: It's relatively quick.

925
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:50,308
Scott: And in fact, more players makes it sort of faster.

926
00:45:50,328 --> 00:45:50,610
Scott: Yeah.

927
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:55,670
Scott: But even though you wait longer for your turn to come around, there's only so many tiles in the game.

928
00:45:56,331 --> 00:45:58,830
Scott: So I don't recommend it necessarily.

929
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:03,390
Rym: Like if you're just building out your board game collection, it's not one of the must haves.

930
00:46:03,471 --> 00:46:04,529
Rym: It's not like you need this game.

931
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:05,890
Rym: There are other games you should buy first.

932
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:09,429
Scott: Yeah, I think I would take a brief encounter over Toluva, but Toluva is pretty good.

933
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:11,169
Rym: Toluva is a good game to own.

934
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:19,629
Rym: If you, for example, go to places where you're just constantly like teaching people relatively light games, you have to teach them quickly because it is quick to teach and play.

935
00:46:20,133 --> 00:46:21,250
Rym: Quick to set up, quick to tear down.

936
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:21,670
Scott: It is kind of nice.

937
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:24,030
Scott: It falls into that Carcassonne department, right?

938
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:28,710
Scott: Where it's not spot it, trivial banana grams, throw away warm up game.

939
00:46:29,131 --> 00:46:35,130
Scott: But it's also not ultra hard core, two hour, Agricola, Calist, Puerto Rico game.

940
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:37,800
Scott: I would also recommend it.

941
00:46:38,142 --> 00:46:45,590
Rym: if you're like us and you own every game and you just want something different, like it's good enough to be, oh, I'll buy it because I'll play it every now and then.

942
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:47,849
Scott: Yeah, I don't think it's in print, but I see right now.

943
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:56,270
Scott: So on Board Game Geek, you can get one for twenty dollars and ninety nine because it's somewhat refreshing in the same way that Reef Encounter was refreshing just because it's so different.

944
00:46:56,672 --> 00:46:59,710
Rym: And this game is refreshing because it's so chaotic.

945
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:05,710
Rym: It's been a long time since I played a game that was just as full of chaos, like game changers every round.

946
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:08,110
Rym: It's like Alhambra expanded in that respect.

947
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:13,250
Scott: Yeah, it's like on one turn you might make a move like, all right, I'm going to set up a temple build with this board by the next turn.

948
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:17,090
Rym: Someone volcanoed you and it might as well be an entirely new game.

949
00:47:17,351 --> 00:47:19,830
Scott: Yeah, you're like, all right, now I'm going to because it's like that's.

950
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:25,810
Scott: the other thing is like almost anything you want to do with it for a temple or a tower requires a setup move, right?

951
00:47:26,115 --> 00:47:27,050
Scott: You want to build a tower.

952
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:33,037
Scott: That means on this turn, you've got to put a tile down to make the third level, right, or to make the second level.

953
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:34,990
Scott: that enables the third level on the next turn.

954
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:41,950
Scott: Well, you do that setup move on one turn, but everyone else now gets a turn to destroy your setup and you need another.

955
00:47:42,451 --> 00:47:44,610
Scott: So how can you possibly build a temple or a tower?

956
00:47:44,671 --> 00:47:45,750
Scott: It's very, very difficult.

957
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:49,490
Scott: Much like how in Dickerson Euphrates, and then you had three actions.

958
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:52,450
Scott: So if you can't pull it off, you're forced to play something.

959
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:54,569
Scott: You play a hut because you can almost always play a hut.

960
00:47:54,873 --> 00:47:55,970
Scott: So you're forced to play huts.

961
00:47:56,350 --> 00:48:02,990
Scott: And if you can't get your temples and your towers out, you're forced to play all your huts and then you volcano your own huts just to get some back.

962
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:03,532
Rym: Yep.

963
00:48:03,937 --> 00:48:04,909
Scott: And shit gets crazy.

964
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:06,569
Rym: Actually, I think volcano and huts go away.

965
00:48:07,411 --> 00:48:07,817
Scott: I forget.

966
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:08,709
Rym: Yeah, they go away.

967
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:09,988
Scott: I think I thought you got them back.

968
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:12,469
Rym: Covered huts are returned to the box.

969
00:48:13,332 --> 00:48:14,319
Scott: I think we fucked that up.

970
00:48:14,399 --> 00:48:15,265
Rym: Yeah, I think you did.

971
00:48:15,587 --> 00:48:15,970
Scott: Oh, shit.

972
00:48:16,211 --> 00:48:18,969
Rym: I didn't read the rules or you guys taught me.

973
00:48:19,171 --> 00:48:22,007
Rym: So it's all you and Alex that that changes everything.

974
00:48:22,028 --> 00:48:22,410
Scott: Yeah.

975
00:48:22,896 --> 00:48:24,090
Rym: I'm reading your volcanic eruption.

976
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:27,130
Rym: The overview plays volcano tile on top of existing tiles.

977
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:30,010
Rym: Volcano on volcano that has different direction.

978
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,319
Rym: No free space may be left beneath the tile.

979
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:34,389
Rym: covered huts are returned to the box.

980
00:48:35,414 --> 00:48:35,555
Rym: Whoa.

981
00:48:35,898 --> 00:48:37,410
Rym: No covering of temples or towers.

982
00:48:37,734 --> 00:48:39,130
Rym: No covering of complete settlements.

983
00:48:40,832 --> 00:48:42,481
Rym: Also, it's a Hanseong gluck game, so.

984
00:48:42,984 --> 00:48:43,225
Scott: Yeah.

985
00:48:43,426 --> 00:48:43,607
Scott: Yeah.

986
00:48:43,909 --> 00:48:44,130
Scott: All good.

987
00:48:49,943 --> 00:48:52,100
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

988
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,500
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

989
00:48:54,661 --> 00:48:57,220
Rym: Kat Lee for Web Design and Brando K for the logos.

990
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:02,619
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row crew dot com for show notes, discussion news and more.

991
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,560
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

992
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:10,299
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

993
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:13,816
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

994
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:18,079
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

995
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,260
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
