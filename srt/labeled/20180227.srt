00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,442
Rym: It's Tuesday, February 27th 2018.

2
00:00:12,442 --> 00:00:12,963
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,224 --> 00:00:15,209
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:18,408
Rym: tonight We're talking about meeple circus.

5
00:00:21,012 --> 00:00:22,028
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:28,453
Rym: So Rangers haven't been doing so well in the old hockey game.

7
00:00:28,673 --> 00:00:28,854
Scott: Nope.

8
00:00:29,055 --> 00:00:30,520
Rym: It's been pretty bad pretty sad.

9
00:00:30,761 --> 00:00:30,981
Scott: I mean.

10
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:33,731
Scott: we have one Stanley Cup in 70 something years.

11
00:00:33,872 --> 00:00:36,100
Rym: Yep, and it's also never been good.

12
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:48,846
Rym: Extra weird because my entire sentient life I have never ever experienced the Stanley Cup where my team wasn't at least in it Because the right wing is my entire life.

13
00:00:49,367 --> 00:00:55,045
Rym: and then the first year the Red Wings were ever not in the playoffs in modern history Rangers were there so it was fine.

14
00:00:55,546 --> 00:01:00,040
Rym: But this year Rangers and Red Wings are basically tied at not in the playoffs.

15
00:01:00,603 --> 00:01:02,956
Scott: We are in the tank roll.

16
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,580
Scott: Thanks roll.

17
00:01:04,322 --> 00:01:17,820
Rym: And it was even funnier because last night was a game between the tied in points Red Wings and Rangers Which is always extra weird because on one hand I I'm primarily a Rangers fan because I've lived in New York for a decade like it's you let the pass go.

18
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,726
Rym: I'm a Rangers fan.

19
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:19,330
Rym: He moved.

20
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:20,640
Scott: he moved to Arizona.

21
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,607
Scott: I probably would.

22
00:01:22,647 --> 00:01:28,508
Rym: eventually the trouble is I instinctively cheer whenever the Red Wings score.

23
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:35,608
Rym: so when the Red Wings won the game in overtime I Cheered while simultaneously booing.

24
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,079
Rym: It's such a cognitive dissonance to see two teams.

25
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:48,140
Rym: I Even if I say I am rooting for the Rangers this core part of me is like yes when the red and white jersey scores.

26
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:54,340
Rym: What makes even worse is that there was a home game in the MSG So the Red Wings were in their away uniform.

27
00:01:54,801 --> 00:02:01,439
Rym: But the Red Wings the away uniforms of today are basically what the home uniforms were a decade ago.

28
00:02:02,681 --> 00:02:08,419
Rym: And for all my childhood hockey, so it was extra weird because it was like that's the home jersey.

29
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,520
Rym: My brain associates with the Rangers and the home jersey my team associates with the Red Wings.

30
00:02:14,022 --> 00:02:17,456
Rym: My brain was just having trouble figuring out what to think during this game as a result.

31
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:23,027
Rym: Mm-hmm but the trade deadline ended today and You sold everybody now.

32
00:02:23,067 --> 00:02:24,654
Rym: They didn't sell everybody everybody.

33
00:02:24,874 --> 00:02:26,140
Scott: Not everyone was buying.

34
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,245
Scott: You can't.

35
00:02:27,286 --> 00:02:30,060
Scott: you can't sell a stock if no one wants to pay what it costs.

36
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:32,307
Rym: Take note Bitcoin people.

37
00:02:32,407 --> 00:02:34,697
Rym: someone has to be willing to pay for your Bitcoin.

38
00:02:34,777 --> 00:02:35,440
Scott: I got a Bitcoin.

39
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:36,948
Scott: I want to sell it for the 20,000.

40
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,080
Scott: It's supposedly worth wine giving you.

41
00:02:41,482 --> 00:02:42,123
Scott: Keep your nothing.

42
00:02:42,144 --> 00:02:51,011
Scott: I'll keep my $20,000 which is basically a car and I giving you a car for nothing Say I guess we'll get right into it.

43
00:02:51,031 --> 00:02:51,939
Rym: You got any gaming news.

44
00:02:53,162 --> 00:02:55,416
Scott: What was my gaming news already forgot?

45
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:56,140
Scott: Yeah, I did art.

46
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:56,943
Scott: Oh, I do remember.

47
00:02:57,404 --> 00:03:00,776
Scott: so the people who made FTL are coming out with this new game.

48
00:03:00,796 --> 00:03:02,080
Scott: That's that's all the rage.

49
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,931
Scott: It comes out like what tomorrow or something real?

50
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:09,165
Scott: Yeah today Ridiculously soon right?

51
00:03:09,185 --> 00:03:13,600
Scott: this game has been hyped up for a countdown on Steam until it unlocks if you pre-order it as a class.

52
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:17,312
Scott: Yeah, anyway, so this game is called into the breach.

53
00:03:17,472 --> 00:03:20,624
Scott: I think yep, and if it's made by the FTL people So it's a rogue.

54
00:03:20,644 --> 00:03:26,349
Scott: you like the rogue like like we like And it's probably high quality because they seemed.

55
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:31,214
Scott: it is a very good and it is a grid turn-based strategy game involving mechs.

56
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:39,901
Scott: So imagine FTL except when you go to the next place instead of having like this spaceship battle thing going on you.

57
00:03:39,961 --> 00:03:49,388
Scott: instead you do a little tiny advance wars involving mechs and Then you do another one and basically when your people die They're like sort of like Fire Emblem.

58
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:58,700
Scott: and when you got one when you got one guy left You can you basically run away and start the game over with that one guy and that one guy can keep leveling up even if You keep failing.

59
00:03:58,861 --> 00:04:00,511
Rym: I always wanted an advance.

60
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:02,020
Rym: wars like game where?

61
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:09,619
Scott: Victory and defeat weren't just this but of course that one guy that like you've taken on like let's say you go through and you Fail, but you save this one, dude.

62
00:04:09,981 --> 00:04:14,180
Scott: Then you keep you try again, and you fail, but you save the same dude because he's the most leveled up guy.

63
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,246
Scott: That's you're gonna save right.

64
00:04:15,487 --> 00:04:17,619
Scott: you go through a third time, and you save that dude again.

65
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,959
Scott: now He's way powerful and on the fourth go through that guy dies.

66
00:04:21,741 --> 00:04:24,500
Rym: Apparently there is a ton of stuff in the game.

67
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:33,238
Rym: There's a quote here in this polygon article after just an hour in the game I'd already unlocked much more new content than in a dozen hours of the previous game FTL.

68
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:33,600
Scott: right now.

69
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:38,280
Rym: That's not to say it was any easier simply more generous and encouraging of experimentation.

70
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,106
Rym: I also I will say I like FTL.

71
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,353
Rym: it does not encourage experimentation.

72
00:04:42,433 --> 00:04:46,126
Rym: I am terrified of almost every decision I make in that game, so this is a game.

73
00:04:46,146 --> 00:04:47,311
Scott: That's coming out soon.

74
00:04:47,331 --> 00:04:53,654
Scott: I want to talk briefly about this other game That's the hotness these days called slay the spire, which I had been playing even though.

75
00:04:53,674 --> 00:04:55,500
Scott: It's just early access beta mode.

76
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,344
Rym: Oh, yeah, I got to play that.

77
00:04:56,485 --> 00:04:58,937
Scott: so this game slay the spire is an early access.

78
00:04:58,997 --> 00:05:07,394
Scott: right now it is made by some people in the netrunner community and Basically, it's also a roguelike, but it's a roguelike deck building game.

79
00:05:07,434 --> 00:05:11,875
Scott: both of these are single-player PC games by the way And the way it works is like you know dominion.

80
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:16,640
Scott: you draw a hand of cards You play as many as you can you throw out the rest you draw a new hand of cards, right?

81
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:23,171
Scott: So what this is is like a little Final Fantasy battle And you get a hand of cards and you play them, and you're just.

82
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:24,557
Scott: you're the only one playing cards.

83
00:05:24,637 --> 00:05:27,981
Scott: the bad guys Actually tell you exactly what the fuck they're gonna Do.

84
00:05:28,021 --> 00:05:33,765
Scott: it's like oh I can see that that guy is going to attack for 15 and that guy's gonna do some sort of Defensive move.

85
00:05:33,806 --> 00:05:42,879
Scott: this turn and you play your you have three mana And you play your player cards And then you throw out whatever you don't play and draw a new hand and then the things happen.

86
00:05:43,665 --> 00:05:58,560
Scott: And then you play cards again And as you continue through the game you remove cards from your deck adds add cards to your deck get relics They give you special abilities And you go on to the next battle in the next battle in the next battle and getting all sorts of stuff going on.

87
00:05:58,721 --> 00:06:02,099
Scott: Shopping for different you know potions and stuff go alright.

88
00:06:02,622 --> 00:06:09,048
Scott: This is also a way fun roguelike is basically playing dominion against the computer Also a roguelike.

89
00:06:09,088 --> 00:06:11,560
Scott: this game is way hot even though it's early access.

90
00:06:11,761 --> 00:06:17,120
Scott: It is already hot and it is way successful like there's a zillion streamers on Twitch for this game.

91
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:18,870
Scott: Yeah, even though it's early access.

92
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:22,548
Scott: so right now It is a single-player strategy.

93
00:06:22,588 --> 00:06:28,797
Scott: roguelike PC gaming time and those are the two games That you got play slay the spire and into the breach.

94
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:34,500
Rym: yep I'm feeling this into the bridge even though cuz you know fire emblem has that mobile game that has like the mini grid battles.

95
00:06:34,581 --> 00:06:35,105
Scott: I've never.

96
00:06:35,206 --> 00:06:38,426
Scott: that is a garbage pain Microchess game.

97
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:39,129
Scott: that is not a.

98
00:06:39,371 --> 00:06:51,431
Rym: I have never been a fan previously of the small grid style of advanced wars like games because they tended to Never involve even the remotest of interesting strategy.

99
00:06:51,692 --> 00:06:54,039
Scott: I still I still gonna bet you will enjoy this game.

100
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,810
Rym: I Feel pretty confident this game's gonna break that trend for me.

101
00:06:58,232 --> 00:06:59,636
Rym: Just looking at these screen shot.

102
00:06:59,656 --> 00:07:01,578
Scott: You like the gym fire though That was small grids.

103
00:07:02,682 --> 00:07:18,740
Rym: Yeah, but so the gym fire the small grid was more about food management for the Army's verse and as opposed to it Fantasy empires was more about the like desertion rate of your troops based on their morale.

104
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,420
Scott: I mean that isn't that just a different abstraction of the same food concept?

105
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:23,364
Rym: No, the food was.

106
00:07:23,605 --> 00:07:26,076
Rym: you'll have food like the army when you attack someone you choose.

107
00:07:26,116 --> 00:07:34,544
Rym: It's one of those old like Koay games that was like here's how many troops I'm bringing and here's how much food I'm bringing with me.

108
00:07:34,564 --> 00:07:38,760
Rym: and then the bigger your army was the more food it burned through per day.

109
00:07:39,182 --> 00:07:42,080
Rym: And you might run out of food before you broke the siege and all that kind of nonsense.

110
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:43,967
Rym: Nobody likes Jim fire, but me.

111
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:45,011
Rym: that's there.

112
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:47,199
Rym: That's the end result there, but I'm feeling this game.

113
00:07:48,361 --> 00:07:51,419
Rym: So in some other news if you didn't notice I play a lot of overwatch.

114
00:07:52,303 --> 00:08:05,926
Rym: it's kind of my main game now and One of the things that I always lamented was that overwatch didn't really include a capture the flag mode Even though capture the flag the number one mode in a character class-based FPS see competitive you say that.

115
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:10,920
Rym: but actually capture the flag was the number one mode in an era that predates most gamers.

116
00:08:11,668 --> 00:08:18,080
Scott: Yes, but for me That's the number one mode that you played in Tia anything with a TF in the title and anything with the tribes in the title.

117
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:21,030
Scott: Capture the flag was the default number one mode.

118
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,836
Scott: all the other modes were secondary modes.

119
00:08:22,976 --> 00:08:32,900
Rym: yep, so Overwatch did introduce a capture the flag mode But it was just in the arcade team fortress 2 and it was broken and it was crappy and it wasn't really well thought out.

120
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,488
Scott: They wasn't that the first mode they made.

121
00:08:35,508 --> 00:08:36,953
Rym: yeah, so they made there.

122
00:08:37,094 --> 00:08:39,462
Scott: I wasn't that the primary game mode There's.

123
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:43,953
Rym: I don't actually really know why they didn't make the game CTF first other than that.

124
00:08:44,515 --> 00:08:49,455
Rym: I don't think CTF has Really any cache a with most modern gamers.

125
00:08:49,475 --> 00:08:50,480
Rym: It's just us old-timers.

126
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,520
Rym: But the existing modes with the payload push in the zone capture and all that they're fine.

127
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,840
Rym: But capture the flag I think has a lot more potential for good spectator experiences.

128
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,561
Scott: Yeah I was.

129
00:09:01,762 --> 00:09:08,828
Scott: I always thought that CTF was the default mode because you carry into it your Childhood experience of playing literal capture the flag.

130
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:11,156
Rym: most kids don't play capture the flag and how.

131
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:12,340
Scott: that is the greatest thing.

132
00:09:12,641 --> 00:09:17,039
Scott: And now the fact that you know, of course, that's what you would want to do in the video game land, right?

133
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:20,190
Rym: A lot of kids don't play capture the flag.

134
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:20,872
Scott: Well, that's a crime.

135
00:09:20,912 --> 00:09:22,498
Scott: We should start competitive real-world.

136
00:09:22,538 --> 00:09:24,899
Rym: capture the flag Yeah, but with guns like paintball.

137
00:09:26,081 --> 00:09:27,006
Scott: How about with just nothing?

138
00:09:27,448 --> 00:09:28,493
Scott: just capturing flags?

139
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,619
Scott: Yeah and jail.

140
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,674
Rym: and When we played it we bet the rules for catching someone.

141
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,438
Rym: it wasn't the rules.

142
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,968
Scott: We changed the rules so many fucking times.

143
00:09:37,349 --> 00:09:43,191
Rym: We used touch football flags like flag football and You basically had to grab a guy's flag and then he was out.

144
00:09:43,212 --> 00:09:44,680
Scott: We're doing an episode and capture the flag.

145
00:09:45,621 --> 00:09:48,733
Scott: That is that I'm writing that down cuz I was gonna tell a story of.

146
00:09:48,773 --> 00:09:50,420
Scott: I'm gonna save it right down.

147
00:09:50,621 --> 00:09:59,635
Rym: I write it down right now tonight's episode and capture the flag coming soon Because if we don't write it down right now, it will literally never happen.

148
00:09:59,756 --> 00:10:04,942
Rym: someone remind us In fact, it will curse us if we if I say if we say oh, we'll remember to do this We won't.

149
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,416
Rym: it guarantees that we will die before we make that episode.

150
00:10:07,437 --> 00:10:07,859
Scott: That's right.

151
00:10:08,715 --> 00:10:17,325
Rym: So Blizzard did what they do in that whenever there's a mode that they introduced like Lucio ball or something and then everyone says oh this Mode is broken.

152
00:10:17,385 --> 00:10:18,152
Rym: This sucks or whatever.

153
00:10:18,273 --> 00:10:19,019
Rym: We don't care about it.

154
00:10:19,941 --> 00:10:22,489
Rym: They pay attention and they just quietly fix it.

155
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:31,000
Rym: So they re-released capture the flag and they fixed Almost all the problems the previous initial iteration of capture the flag problems?

156
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:33,580
Rym: Does it still have the problems that it still has?

157
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,360
Rym: So are so let's see right now the things they change is probably more interesting.

158
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,278
Rym: So now first team to capture three times wins in the time of the match.

159
00:10:42,378 --> 00:10:42,880
Scott: That sounds good.

160
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:48,790
Rym: Yeah, if it is tied at the end of that time, so two flags each say yep Then it goes on to death.

161
00:10:48,851 --> 00:10:49,900
Scott: next flag wins God.

162
00:10:50,047 --> 00:10:51,705
Rym: No So the game restarts.

163
00:10:51,745 --> 00:10:59,259
Rym: you re-pick your heroes and it moves the two flags and the capture points To be basically right fucking next to each other in the middle of the map.

164
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,275
Rym: Okay, and just go go go.

165
00:11:02,961 --> 00:11:05,211
Rym: It just ends almost immediately after.

166
00:11:05,251 --> 00:11:07,380
Scott: oh because the flag and the capture point are adjacent.

167
00:11:07,682 --> 00:11:09,879
Scott: Yes, you have to take the flag and just move it like an inch.

168
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,859
Rym: They're like they'll be like a pillar and they're basically like 40 feet apart on either side of a pillar.

169
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,594
Scott: So you have to rush to the middle grab the flag and slam dunk it.

170
00:11:18,634 --> 00:11:20,020
Rym: Yeah, it doesn't move the spawn points.

171
00:11:20,101 --> 00:11:21,659
Rym: The spawn points are still way back, right?

172
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,440
Scott: See basically everyone rushes to the middle to try to grab their flag and slam dunk it in the net.

173
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,560
Scott: That's right next to the flag?

174
00:11:26,688 --> 00:11:30,031
Scott: Yep But also because I bring it all the way back to your spawn like usual.

175
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:39,560
Rym: but also it means that killing even one person on The other team it's probably already game over because even if they get time to respawn they got to run all the way back.

176
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:44,000
Scott: Are there any sort of like characters that can like sort of control the area and push the enemies back?

177
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,399
Scott: So long enough for the fast person to move the flag?

178
00:11:46,862 --> 00:11:49,873
Rym: Oh, yeah, there are and that's part of the strategy of those eggs.

179
00:11:49,934 --> 00:11:51,460
Rym: those options exist for both sides.

180
00:11:51,681 --> 00:11:52,889
Scott: Okay, what do you do about him?

181
00:11:53,191 --> 00:11:54,460
Scott: be faster rush in the middle?

182
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:00,480
Rym: They also dealt with the problem where characters have movement powers like some characters can fly or teleport or whatever.

183
00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:05,136
Rym: so the rule they implemented was anyone can grab the flag and passive powers work.

184
00:12:05,176 --> 00:12:09,538
Rym: fine, but Special movement powers cause you to drop the flag.

185
00:12:09,638 --> 00:12:19,486
Rym: Mm-hmm Yeah Which on one end I disagree with because in the old weapons factory days and like mega TF the super fast recon type flying characters They could just fly with the flag.

186
00:12:19,526 --> 00:12:21,152
Scott: I mean you have Scout and TF - it's.

187
00:12:21,413 --> 00:12:22,919
Rym: and they just rip and right back out.

188
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:33,759
Rym: But I do see how that really violates the sensibilities of modern gamers and I can swallow my bile Because it is actually pretty good the way they've implemented it.

189
00:12:34,322 --> 00:12:37,259
Scott: I think the way you want to do it is just the way tribes to did it where it's like.

190
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,147
Scott: yeah You got jetpack.

191
00:12:38,248 --> 00:12:38,974
Scott: So does everybody?

192
00:12:39,297 --> 00:12:45,360
Scott: Yeah It's fine for you to jetpack with that flag and get into a strike because guess what here comes some more strikes.

193
00:12:45,701 --> 00:12:47,686
Rym: But blizzard escalated real quick.

194
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:50,233
Rym: They didn't just fix most of the problems with CTF.

195
00:12:50,554 --> 00:12:52,500
Rym: They made it a ranked competitive mode.

196
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:54,878
Rym: yeah, so now there's the only mode worth playing.

197
00:12:54,899 --> 00:13:04,795
Rym: and the only thing I have to say is that I've been solo Rando queuing the competitive capture the flag and I know for a fact I know capture the flag like I know my own blood.

198
00:13:04,815 --> 00:13:05,377
Rym: Mm-hmm.

199
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:14,280
Rym: Problem is as far as I can tell 100% of the other human beings playing this capture the flag mode are in fact dogs chewing on controllers.

200
00:13:15,382 --> 00:13:18,219
Rym: Good God can people can people younger than us?

201
00:13:18,934 --> 00:13:24,820
Scott: Not You then be quickly ranking out of the dog with controller would rank and getting to a higher tier.

202
00:13:25,163 --> 00:13:34,880
Rym: So in a capture the flag mode One person even with the you know, like the they've let the movement powers worked out or at everything Cannot on their own swing the game.

203
00:13:36,181 --> 00:13:41,860
Scott: So it's another crappy ranking mode that based only on wins and losses and not based on individual performance based on teams.

204
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:51,504
Rym: The thing is remember everything in overwatch the ranked systems Almost every complaint anyone has is around the fact that the game is designed from its very core To be a game.

205
00:13:51,544 --> 00:13:52,869
Rym: or you have a team of six.

206
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:59,480
Rym: as soon as you are saying put me on a team with other people You're already violating a fundamental contract of the game.

207
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,373
Scott: Does it separate your rankings for solo play from your rankings?

208
00:14:02,413 --> 00:14:03,960
Scott: for I have a prepared team play?

209
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,260
Scott: Uh, no, but match make but rocket League gets that right?

210
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,960
Scott: You have a separate rank in every different mode in rocket League.

211
00:14:11,442 --> 00:14:15,340
Scott: So if you prepare teams you get ranked separately from your solo, right?

212
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:27,040
Rym: So instead what the matchmaking does is it will whenever possible if you come in with a four stack or a six stack Put you against another group of equivalent size with the same number of randos.

213
00:14:28,942 --> 00:14:32,020
Rym: So if I make a team of five, I'll go up against another team of five.

214
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:38,977
Rym: We both get the Russian roulette of the Hanzo that's gonna join not join the team chat and proceed to sit in the corner crying Mm-hmm.

215
00:14:40,401 --> 00:14:46,737
Rym: So, yeah, this is pretty interesting how it's shaken down and I hope they've already talked about more changes They're gonna make to CTF.

216
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:54,389
Rym: They're really they're pushing CTF way harder than I expected which is real interesting because this is the mode I actually care about a lot.

217
00:14:54,671 --> 00:14:55,214
Scott: That's the mood.

218
00:14:55,274 --> 00:14:56,140
Scott: I care about a lot, too.

219
00:14:56,441 --> 00:15:00,740
Rym: Yeah, if it I will I will tell you if it gets good enough to where it's worth you playing it.

220
00:15:01,182 --> 00:15:01,947
Rym: It's not there yet.

221
00:15:02,008 --> 00:15:02,692
Rym: It's not.

222
00:15:02,793 --> 00:15:03,940
Scott: it still cost too much money.

223
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,308
Rym: What do you care?

224
00:15:05,328 --> 00:15:05,791
Rym: You got money?

225
00:15:05,811 --> 00:15:07,160
Scott: I mean by furniture.

226
00:15:08,202 --> 00:15:13,337
Scott: Actually, I too need to buy Someone on Twitter was like hey, New York City friends.

227
00:15:13,397 --> 00:15:15,186
Scott: I'm coming to New York Can I get a couch?

228
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,379
Scott: and I was like my couch literally has a giant hole in it.

229
00:15:17,721 --> 00:15:24,320
Rym: We were at a friend's house someone else playing a game night the other night over the weekend and they had just bought a new couch.

230
00:15:24,561 --> 00:15:35,170
Rym: I was grilling him about that patch but anyway things of the day we got.

231
00:15:36,551 --> 00:15:40,266
Scott: So I'm pretty sure everyone's seen this on the internet already, but it's so good.

232
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,210
Scott: It's got me thinking today.

233
00:15:42,452 --> 00:15:44,078
Scott: I saw the link earlier, but I washed it.

234
00:15:44,099 --> 00:15:44,962
Scott: poor Rym got here.

235
00:15:45,263 --> 00:15:46,910
Scott: So there's a game that's old by now.

236
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:50,521
Scott: I actually called papers, please if you haven't played papers papers game.

237
00:15:50,561 --> 00:15:51,003
Rym: just play it.

238
00:15:51,163 --> 00:15:53,330
Scott: It is a way good single-player PC game.

239
00:15:53,431 --> 00:15:54,738
Scott: I think it might be on other platforms.

240
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:58,336
Scott: I don't even know but PC is best Master race.

241
00:15:58,356 --> 00:16:03,013
Scott: so go on your PC and play papers, please if you haven't already But I'm pretty sure you have.

242
00:16:03,455 --> 00:16:17,022
Scott: it is a game where you are in a fictional but obviously Eastern European East Germany country where there is a you know, very You know big brother government and you are at.

243
00:16:17,403 --> 00:16:28,404
Scott: you're in charge of inspecting people's passports and such trying to come into the country at the border and you have instructions and you're Inspecting to make sure documents are legit and you let people in or turn them away.

244
00:16:28,424 --> 00:16:30,629
Rym: the games like the the give you a sense of this game.

245
00:16:30,851 --> 00:16:32,797
Rym: Literally you in the game will.

246
00:16:32,978 --> 00:16:34,322
Rym: someone will hand you their passport.

247
00:16:34,363 --> 00:16:36,490
Rym: you look at it and flip it over like look through the stuff.

248
00:16:36,972 --> 00:16:41,859
Rym: Then if you're not sure you pull out this giant book in game Put it on the table.

249
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:48,390
Rym: that covers your whole stupid table Like it's in the way and a problem and you're flipping through it trying to figure out what to do based on the rules.

250
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,317
Scott: Anyway, so it's a great game.

251
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,230
Scott: And for some reason even though the game is way old.

252
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:58,030
Scott: There is now an official short film of the game.

253
00:16:58,211 --> 00:17:07,384
Scott: So if you whether if you've played the game You will appreciate this short film very very much And if you haven't this short film will convince you to go back and play it.

254
00:17:08,006 --> 00:17:12,987
Rym: the games real good And also it's it's more real and disturbing than you might expect.

255
00:17:13,007 --> 00:17:13,489
Rym: Mm-hmm.

256
00:17:14,193 --> 00:17:16,163
Rym: And if you haven't played you just got to play this game.

257
00:17:16,183 --> 00:17:31,722
Rym: Mm-hmm, so Apparently if you skate as an ice skate on really thin ice thin like like an inch I mean that's thin but it's not Super thin like.

258
00:17:31,742 --> 00:17:39,820
Scott: when I think of thin ice I think like, you know that little tiny sliver of ice that forms that rhyme of ice Like jump across.

259
00:17:39,861 --> 00:17:42,895
Rym: as a kid in the elementary school playground I think you crash through it

260
00:17:43,076 --> 00:17:50,730
Scott: like there's a puddle and it's a really cold day and there's just like this little tiny sheet of Ice floating on it and if you poke it crackles, you know, it's like it's like cornflake thick.

261
00:17:51,356 --> 00:17:52,409
Scott: So that's thin ice.

262
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:57,988
Rym: Apparently there is this sport in I guess Norway called Nordic skating or anything.

263
00:17:58,148 --> 00:18:09,987
Rym: any sport Involving cold and snow is in Norway or wild ice skating and basically they just ice skate on Super thin ice through the wilderness like down rivers, isn't this?

264
00:18:10,067 --> 00:18:13,776
Scott: I mean an inch isn't Ridiculously dangerous, but it's still dangerous.

265
00:18:13,816 --> 00:18:15,060
Scott: Yeah, what if you fall in?

266
00:18:15,441 --> 00:18:17,407
Rym: so if no one's there you're dead.

267
00:18:17,427 --> 00:18:19,798
Scott: Oh, okay I'm just checking that.

268
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:32,376
Rym: but the cool the cool things about this are one don't Actually explains in pretty good detail like What the deal with this is and like why it works and why he doesn't just fall through and why if you tried to do It you probably would fall through.

269
00:18:32,396 --> 00:18:35,070
Scott: maybe he's super light and maybe he's doing it in a certain way.

270
00:18:35,853 --> 00:18:41,010
Scott: There's a lot of science distributing his weight across more ice and not pushing it into a single spot in the ice.

271
00:18:41,331 --> 00:18:43,200
Rym: Also, just the way ice forms.

272
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:43,421
Scott: Yes.

273
00:18:43,482 --> 00:18:44,065
Scott: I'm just guessing.

274
00:18:44,105 --> 00:18:47,856
Rym: Yeah, what kinds of Pressures are being exerted?

275
00:18:48,197 --> 00:18:50,103
Rym: like it's risk kind of complicated actually.

276
00:18:50,344 --> 00:19:00,440
Rym: Oh, in fact the video just said it's complicated Mm-hmm, but the craziest thing about it is the sounds that Thin ice make when you skate on it.

277
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:05,970
Scott: This is this video is really cool just for that Because usually when you skate in an ice rink, there's nothing under the ice.

278
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,950
Scott: It's a floor and we skate on thick ice like three four or five inches.

279
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:09,572
Scott: It's just ice.

280
00:19:09,652 --> 00:19:16,480
Scott: the sat the vibrations in the set the the view and the sound waves from you skating don't really go into the Water or come out of the water.

281
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,830
Scott: very much, right?

282
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:25,468
Scott: but if it's thin ice like an inch then the sounds can go in the water and come back and sort of echo against the Bottom of the ice and they sound cool.

283
00:19:25,883 --> 00:19:34,482
Rym: Yep And I use this as my thing of the day instead of the kid pissing on the elevator because while that is a plus We're still not sure how if that's a fake video or not.

284
00:19:34,502 --> 00:19:40,588
Scott: I am more than 50% convinced It's fake, but if you didn't see elevator piss boy, you got to see it even though it's fake.

285
00:19:40,608 --> 00:19:41,030
Scott: It's still worth.

286
00:19:41,853 --> 00:19:42,696
Scott: Just go into it.

287
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,503
Rym: It's like a sub thing of the day.

288
00:19:44,604 --> 00:19:47,780
Scott: go into it a mat, you know Thinking it's probably fake.

289
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:49,450
Scott: not definitely but probably yeah.

290
00:19:51,251 --> 00:19:53,600
Rym: In the meta moment, we're going to be live at PAX East 2018.

291
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,563
Rym: Oh my god.

292
00:19:54,584 --> 00:19:55,647
Scott: Why is it so soon?

293
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,697
Rym: Oh my god I haven't even like plan.

294
00:19:57,898 --> 00:20:01,153
Rym: apparently there's a Amtrak discount for packs Really?

295
00:20:01,373 --> 00:20:05,044
Rym: Yeah, so cuz every year around this time I'm much of a discount.

296
00:20:05,285 --> 00:20:06,810
Rym: I don't know cuz you have to call them.

297
00:20:07,732 --> 00:20:11,129
Rym: You can't just like do it on the Amtrak website feeling a boat bus.

298
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,137
Rym: Yeah, I'll probably Amtrak.

299
00:20:13,157 --> 00:20:15,390
Rym: It's just so much faster and more chill.

300
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:23,790
Scott: It's like an hour and a half faster, okay, but it's like 10 bucks to ride a bull bus.

301
00:20:23,971 --> 00:20:25,437
Scott: Yeah, it's like even with a discount.

302
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,402
Scott: What's the Amtrak gonna be?

303
00:20:26,462 --> 00:20:27,025
Rym: It's like 60 bucks.

304
00:20:27,065 --> 00:20:30,336
Scott: Yeah So and I gotta go two ways.

305
00:20:30,678 --> 00:20:37,425
Rym: that's a lot of money saves for you know, 90 minutes true But partly I'm gonna see what this discount is, but I digress.

306
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:38,410
Rym: we're gonna be a pack.

307
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,889
Scott: I'm gonna be ten bucks each way.

308
00:20:40,271 --> 00:20:41,115
Rym: Yeah, well, I got I got.

309
00:20:41,396 --> 00:20:44,690
Rym: I got the rewards program with Amtrak and I got a lot of free Amtrak's coming my way.

310
00:20:45,093 --> 00:20:45,920
Scott: It's not rewards.

311
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,170
Scott: you paid for those when you paid.

312
00:20:49,395 --> 00:20:55,770
Rym: But we will be there on Sunday doing the like full final for real version of our top 40 tabletop games.

313
00:20:56,895 --> 00:20:59,170
Scott: Right, it's only sounds like a clickbait panel, right?

314
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,730
Scott: Cuz it's like oh we're gonna go listing top 40 games.

315
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:09,956
Scott: But actually what we're doing is it's we're just gonna use that as an excuse to talk about 40 different gaming Concepts that are worth knowing.

316
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:13,288
Scott: and it's just those games just examples of those kinds to give you an idea.

317
00:21:13,851 --> 00:21:15,198
Rym: The way not a ranking thing.

318
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:17,230
Rym: the way we write this panel is for every game.

319
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:31,711
Rym: Oh a game only makes this list if there are two Noteworthy interesting things about the game's mechanics and it can't be the same thing as any other game on the list And it's a lot of games that we don't actually like at all Mm-hmm.

320
00:21:32,574 --> 00:21:33,436
Rym: So yeah, that'll be fun.

321
00:21:33,456 --> 00:21:40,837
Rym: And otherwise PAX East is for goddamn days and it looks like Thursdays and Sundays aren't even sold out yet.

322
00:21:41,118 --> 00:21:44,570
Scott: Yeah, you can go to PAX East Thursday or Sunday for like 50 bucks.

323
00:21:44,992 --> 00:21:46,259
Rym: Yeah, that ain't bad.

324
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,130
Scott: I mean on Sunday you're getting a short day.

325
00:21:48,231 --> 00:21:48,555
Scott: So it's not.

326
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:49,669
Scott: you're sort of getting ripped off.

327
00:21:52,592 --> 00:21:57,030
Scott: And if you and you're gonna get a less crowded expo and if you go on Thursday, it's gonna be way not crowded.

328
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,115
Rym: Yeah, keynote Q&A.

329
00:21:58,155 --> 00:21:59,682
Scott: He's one day off work.

330
00:21:59,742 --> 00:22:05,650
Scott: If you live in the area go on Thursday It'll be way less crowded to get the keynote and the Q&A and everything and you get a full PAX day.

331
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,674
Scott: You can stay till midnight.

332
00:22:06,815 --> 00:22:07,718
Scott: Yeah, you know.

333
00:22:07,758 --> 00:22:10,590
Scott: and then I guess it's gonna be pre pax tabletop gaming on Wednesday.

334
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:11,929
Scott: Will there be when?

335
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:13,941
Scott: Wednesday night?

336
00:22:14,022 --> 00:22:18,610
Rym: damn The problem is this is why we don't go to a lot of other conventions anymore.

337
00:22:18,751 --> 00:22:21,262
Rym: All the paxes are like just broadening into.

338
00:22:21,302 --> 00:22:22,910
Rym: eventually our lives will just be packs.

339
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:28,875
Rym: Lisa I'm going where the pool goes Otherwise in about a moment.

340
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:31,790
Rym: the book club book was the fifth season by NK jemisin.

341
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,979
Rym: It was fantastic the current book club book, which I'm gonna update because I started reading it.

342
00:22:34,999 --> 00:22:41,457
Rym: Finally is Emily Wilson's translation new translation of The Odyssey by Homer.

343
00:22:41,658 --> 00:22:44,506
Scott: I haven't gotten much farther in that but I did reread it.

344
00:22:44,826 --> 00:22:46,090
Scott: pop-up book of the Odyssey.

345
00:22:46,453 --> 00:22:48,530
Scott: Oh, it's completion because it didn't take very long.

346
00:22:48,811 --> 00:22:56,114
Rym: So the intro is fantastic, but now I've actually burned quite a bit of a ways through the actual Odyssey itself This translation.

347
00:22:56,174 --> 00:23:00,027
Rym: I went back and read the first like the beginning of the Odyssey in the old translation.

348
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:00,830
Rym: I read from high school.

349
00:23:01,872 --> 00:23:04,559
Rym: It feels way different to read it.

350
00:23:04,579 --> 00:23:14,410
Rym: Mm-hmm If you've never read the Odyssey it It's just very plain and feels very like.

351
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:18,432
Rym: Alright, if he's doing this thing and this jerks up to no good It's just.

352
00:23:18,914 --> 00:23:25,999
Rym: there's something about it that I really like and I don't want to really spoil all that till we do the book club Show, but if you've never read the Odyssey read this translation.

353
00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:26,601
Rym: Mm-hmm.

354
00:23:27,102 --> 00:23:29,510
Rym: And if you have read the Odyssey read this translation.

355
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,373
Rym: Anyway, it's the book club.

356
00:23:30,674 --> 00:23:30,795
Rym: Mm-hmm.

357
00:23:31,517 --> 00:23:33,384
Rym: And if you're not reading our book club books, I don't know.

358
00:23:33,404 --> 00:23:36,422
Rym: read a book read a book Any any of them.

359
00:23:36,564 --> 00:23:36,928
Rym: any book?

360
00:23:37,913 --> 00:23:41,024
Scott: Read not no no audiobook unless you're blind.

361
00:23:41,064 --> 00:23:42,890
Rym: That's okay, then not a sports page.

362
00:23:46,752 --> 00:23:55,409
Rym: So this is a game people circus that I Heard I don't know when I first heard about it cuz it's pretty new like it's weird.

363
00:23:55,670 --> 00:24:01,305
Scott: It feels like the term meeple circus like is just like the first time I heard it.

364
00:24:01,365 --> 00:24:02,227
Scott: It didn't feel new.

365
00:24:02,247 --> 00:24:05,289
Scott: it felt like There's always been a meeple circus.

366
00:24:05,551 --> 00:24:14,550
Rym: Yeah, the meeple circus of every tabletop game ever because pretty much anyone who plays tabletop games What do you do when you're bored because Joey Jojo takes forever on his fucking turn?

367
00:24:14,711 --> 00:24:17,990
Scott: It's like whenever it's your turn when it's not your turn in a tabletop game.

368
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,950
Scott: You're sitting there and in front of you you're playing settlers.

369
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:24,170
Scott: You got a bunch of little houses or meeples and you play with them.

370
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,430
Scott: That's just what you naturally do a meeple circus.

371
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27,915
Scott: The actual game does.

372
00:24:27,935 --> 00:24:32,550
Rym: if you've ever played settlers, you know exactly how high you can stack all your pieces, right?

373
00:24:32,691 --> 00:24:37,590
Scott: It is a game in which you stack wooden board game pieces competitively.

374
00:24:37,992 --> 00:24:39,700
Scott: Now there are the official game.

375
00:24:39,761 --> 00:24:41,248
Scott: It's not like a thing you do while you're bored.

376
00:24:41,268 --> 00:24:46,344
Rym: now There are a lot of tabletop games like via Paletti or Jenga or Rhino hero.

377
00:24:46,745 --> 00:24:49,274
Rym: that involves some sort of stacking Component.

378
00:24:49,495 --> 00:24:52,890
Scott: there are lots of construction games and destruction games.

379
00:24:53,010 --> 00:25:00,476
Scott: We've reviewed many of them on GeekNights and a lot of them have similar problems the one problem being well one person knocks it Everyone else win.

380
00:25:00,516 --> 00:25:01,419
Scott: that's kind of lame.

381
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:09,830
Rym: or one person knocks it down via Paletti And now we have a really hand-fisted and kind of crappy scoring mechanism to determine who won.

382
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:12,529
Rym: Yeah, that really removes the skill component.

383
00:25:13,414 --> 00:25:27,549
Rym: So meeple circus is one of the rare stacking pieces games that has a pretty legit win condition and is about your skill of stacking and Doesn't seem to have a very low skill cap.

384
00:25:28,211 --> 00:25:35,718
Rym: Because many of the games that try to solve this problem end up having such a low skill cap that over the course of a Pax everyone in our group is playing perfectly in.

385
00:25:35,738 --> 00:25:36,400
Rym: the game is boring.

386
00:25:37,243 --> 00:25:38,990
Scott: So pretty much how it works is the app.

387
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,241
Scott: It's an app controlled game, but the app does not actually do much.

388
00:25:42,261 --> 00:25:43,565
Scott: The app is mostly a timer.

389
00:25:43,586 --> 00:25:44,850
Rym: It just plays a song.

390
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:47,329
Scott: Yeah, it's a timer with a circus song.

391
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:54,810
Scott: So the circus has three acts right and in the first act you got a pretty simple circus.

392
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:58,075
Scott: you don't have a lot of pieces to work with and You know, you build.

393
00:25:58,196 --> 00:25:59,907
Scott: everyone is simultaneously making.

394
00:25:59,927 --> 00:26:09,970
Scott: you know It says like it's like the timer starts and everyone has to build their circus and you're trying to arrange the meeples in Such a way according to the rules that they are worth the most points for you.

395
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:20,364
Scott: For example, there might be bonus points for putting a purple guy on top or something Right, like you get you if you get a red guy But you have a measuring stick for how high is your red guy on the ground?

396
00:26:20,405 --> 00:26:22,654
Rym: and some guys can't be on the ground They don't get points.

397
00:26:22,675 --> 00:26:25,110
Rym: some guys can't be under another guy.

398
00:26:25,331 --> 00:26:27,341
Rym: Yeah, some guys are just animals.

399
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:28,930
Scott: each meeple has different rules.

400
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:34,807
Scott: There's camels and elephants and sticks and balls and barrels and all sorts of like.

401
00:26:34,828 --> 00:26:35,510
Rym: the strong man.

402
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:36,895
Scott: There's a strong man.

403
00:26:36,935 --> 00:26:38,742
Scott: There's a. there's this generic acrobats.

404
00:26:38,762 --> 00:26:39,926
Scott: There's all kinds of different meeples.

405
00:26:39,946 --> 00:26:40,950
Scott: They all do different things.

406
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:42,569
Scott: You want to stack them in different ways?

407
00:26:43,554 --> 00:26:44,806
Scott: And then you go after.

408
00:26:44,826 --> 00:26:46,139
Scott: you do that Everyone gets points.

409
00:26:46,482 --> 00:26:48,716
Scott: you do round two Which is pretty similar to round one.

410
00:26:48,776 --> 00:26:52,452
Scott: only now everyone has even more meeples and it gets a little crazy Because

411
00:26:52,472 --> 00:27:04,668
Rym: you're doing this draft mechanic where you know What's likely to like what the scoring things are like what will be scored and then you're sort of drafting to collect pieces Like I'll take this card that gives me two of the blue guys and an elephant.

412
00:27:04,788 --> 00:27:07,195
Scott: Yep So you do round two?

413
00:27:07,275 --> 00:27:11,230
Scott: It's the second act of the circus and then the third act of the circus.

414
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:14,746
Scott: This is where shit gets crazy right and the third act of the circus.

415
00:27:14,927 --> 00:27:18,410
Scott: everyone goes Individually one at a time not simultaneously.

416
00:27:19,773 --> 00:27:26,490
Scott: and while you're doing this Not only do you have to construct something according to the same rules and get the most points?

417
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:33,050
Scott: Not only do you have even more meeples than before but you have to do some sort of performance aspect, right?

418
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:35,037
Scott: For example, what was one of them?

419
00:27:35,057 --> 00:27:38,750
Scott: We say like hop every time you place a certain thing or something.

420
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:42,342
Rym: Yeah, so basically in the first two rounds everyone builds their thing simultaneously.

421
00:27:42,663 --> 00:27:45,937
Rym: when the timer runs out whatever is standing That's what gets scored.

422
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:53,530
Rym: But then in the third one you all take turns Being the audience and they'll end like the person have a rule like clap your hands every time you place a piece.

423
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,155
Rym: So I place it.

424
00:27:54,175 --> 00:27:56,230
Rym: please clap my hands place a piece clap my hand.

425
00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:02,876
Scott: You guys actually do a performance for the third act of the circus and that gets you points if you succeed at it If you if you miss up clapping once.

426
00:28:02,896 --> 00:28:05,004
Scott: this is why the other people aren't doing it simultaneously.

427
00:28:05,024 --> 00:28:06,470
Scott: They're judging you're clapping.

428
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:07,755
Scott: They're like, yeah be clapped.

429
00:28:08,016 --> 00:28:08,236
Scott: Nope.

430
00:28:08,357 --> 00:28:08,979
Scott: She didn't clap.

431
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,187
Rym: No, the good news is they're all objective things.

432
00:28:11,207 --> 00:28:12,070
Rym: There's no ambiguity.

433
00:28:13,271 --> 00:28:14,032
Scott: Very well-written.

434
00:28:14,072 --> 00:28:15,595
Scott: you're not gonna be able to like unfair.

435
00:28:15,615 --> 00:28:16,817
Scott: You're never gonna have a question of like.

436
00:28:17,098 --> 00:28:18,180
Scott: was that a clap?

437
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,097
Scott: You know, it's like.

438
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:21,009
Scott: no it's pretty clear.

439
00:28:21,412 --> 00:28:24,488
Rym: the most fun part of that piece of the game is that one.

440
00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:27,983
Rym: everyone People tend to choke in that part and that's just really funny.

441
00:28:28,023 --> 00:28:28,927
Scott: to have one shot.

442
00:28:28,947 --> 00:28:29,750
Scott: You still got the timer.

443
00:28:29,871 --> 00:28:30,695
Scott: You're all by yourself.

444
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:31,741
Scott: Everyone's looking at you.

445
00:28:31,841 --> 00:28:36,630
Rym: Yeah when I mess up in the first round No one really notices they're busy with their own crap and you're performing right?

446
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:36,951
Scott: It's like.

447
00:28:36,991 --> 00:28:41,090
Scott: it's like more circus role-playing even though you're still just stacking meeples together.

448
00:28:41,431 --> 00:28:45,644
Rym: But - you don't say anything if you're in the audience.

449
00:28:45,744 --> 00:28:51,830
Rym: if the person messes up their performance Like if they forget to clap once I can write it like a role play the audience.

450
00:28:52,811 --> 00:28:54,056
Rym: No, no, the audience just be quiet.

451
00:28:54,096 --> 00:28:54,658
Rym: Don't let him know.

452
00:28:54,698 --> 00:28:58,290
Rym: so they keep doing it not realizing that they failed long ago.

453
00:28:58,471 --> 00:28:59,074
Scott: Oh, no, but I could.

454
00:28:59,094 --> 00:29:00,644
Scott: I could just boo at their bad circus.

455
00:29:01,087 --> 00:29:06,368
Scott: Oh, yeah satisfied that clown sucks And if Dumbo comes out, yeah.

456
00:29:07,431 --> 00:29:13,824
Rym: So the game was set up in the first look area at PAX, which is a pretty good area in general.

457
00:29:13,844 --> 00:29:15,877
Rym: It's kind of an aside But I think it's worth it to talk about it.

458
00:29:15,897 --> 00:29:20,029
Scott: It's an area that was created at Unplugged and it's unplugged the table top PAX.

459
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:25,190
Scott: We scooped up some games from Essen like board games that aren't like published widely in the u.s.

460
00:29:25,251 --> 00:29:27,450
Scott: Yet the kind of games you can't get at your game store.

461
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:32,970
Scott: There's only a few copies so far like preview copies stuff like that games that are like the newest newest hotness.

462
00:29:33,252 --> 00:29:34,681
Scott: They're not gonna be in the library.

463
00:29:34,762 --> 00:29:35,929
Scott: No one's gonna bring them to PAX.

464
00:29:36,371 --> 00:29:41,849
Scott: these are like the only copies you're gonna see for like maybe another few months before they come out in the game store.

465
00:29:41,869 --> 00:29:43,849
Scott: and Here they are at PAX.

466
00:29:44,031 --> 00:29:46,770
Scott: They're set up already on tables where they have a permanent home.

467
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:50,148
Scott: You sit down and play them when no one else is playing a minute and unplugged.

468
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:53,450
Scott: These games were highly trafficked in a very visible area.

469
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:57,890
Scott: You couldn't sit down to play any of them because everyone was board game fans playing them all the time.

470
00:29:58,291 --> 00:29:59,094
Scott: But it packs out.

471
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:04,770
Scott: they were in the back and hidden and no one noticed them or cared about them and they weren't on the printed Books in the map or anything.

472
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:08,630
Scott: So you could totally go over there if you knew what was what and play them to your heart's content.

473
00:30:09,212 --> 00:30:16,728
Rym: So I really like meeple circus and I think a lot of people would probably enjoy they should buy it But I don't think it's a game that I would buy myself.

474
00:30:17,771 --> 00:30:35,056
Rym: The the few problems I see with it based on talking to people who have played it a bunch more or people who were saying Forcers observing people playing this game over the course of entire packs is that if you play this game more than occasionally You can pretty much get to the point of Perfectly stacking every time.

475
00:30:35,076 --> 00:30:40,435
Scott: and I played the game one time and I got the maximum points Available to me.

476
00:30:40,495 --> 00:30:43,290
Scott: based on the cards that were available in the game.

477
00:30:43,511 --> 00:30:49,977
Scott: I could not have gotten any more points than I was gotten and it reminds me actually a lot in that way With potion explosion.

478
00:30:50,078 --> 00:30:52,670
Scott: Yeah and potion explosion is a game with a fun gimmick.

479
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:57,010
Scott: It's marble machine and meeple circus is a fun gimmick an app and stacking all kinds of cool meeples.

480
00:30:57,674 --> 00:31:00,570
Scott: But there's a you the way the mech scoring mechanism works.

481
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:04,426
Scott: This is the maximum score you can get and you either hit the maximum or you don't.

482
00:31:04,486 --> 00:31:07,780
Scott: and potion explosion It's two potions a turn and a meeple circus.

483
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,170
Scott: is just all your meeples stacked correctly?

484
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,509
Rym: What did you draft and what gets scored?

485
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:26,490
Scott: Yep So as long as you're a stacking skill is up to snuff and you're not a small child Or someone, you know who can't stack meeples for some reason You're going to get the maximum points and the game comes down to the drafting part.

486
00:31:27,871 --> 00:31:34,930
Scott: So it's just the drafting part and I think you know on the one hand that reduces the replay value of meeple circus itself.

487
00:31:35,473 --> 00:31:38,610
Scott: But on the other hand, I don't think the game is actually a problem.

488
00:31:38,831 --> 00:31:43,390
Scott: I think the problem is simply that the game needs more pieces to make it harder.

489
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:52,430
Scott: It needs an expansion or something to where it's like, alright, no, no No, literally you're gonna have so many meeples and so many things going on that are so ridiculous.

490
00:31:52,752 --> 00:32:05,929
Scott: You cannot score maximum points, you know But you got to calculate what the best you think you can do is and then it's like, alright This is the best I think I can do but I could get one more guy standing on a wall.

491
00:32:06,651 --> 00:32:08,841
Scott: Do I go for it or not?

492
00:32:08,982 --> 00:32:14,110
Rym: You know me know the app is going to do Like we've all been watching the Olympics lately, you know the figure scene and all that.

493
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:16,530
Rym: So I think of it if the game had a little more components.

494
00:32:17,076 --> 00:32:17,947
Rym: It has this aspect.

495
00:32:17,988 --> 00:32:18,371
Rym: now Which is?

496
00:32:18,391 --> 00:32:33,187
Rym: this aspect breaks down among skilled players that you choose how ambitious you want to be and You can if you increase your maximum score by trying something that's very difficult That might pan out or you might knock it down at the last second and score nothing.

497
00:32:33,448 --> 00:32:37,837
Rym: Yep So if you added a few more pieces I think you could extend that feeling.

498
00:32:37,857 --> 00:32:50,818
Scott: the game needs to give you more pieces and more scoring mechanisms to the point at which Nobody can possibly get the maximum score possible with their own meeples unless they're a god Perfect balance and not right.

499
00:32:51,099 --> 00:33:00,210
Scott: plus, you know the imperfections of the meeples themselves and the table You're playing on and all that comes into play Such that you have to figure out how much you're gonna risk.

500
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:07,170
Scott: Are you gonna go for that crazy move where you get four perfectly round things all stacked on each other or not?

501
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:07,671
Scott: All right.

502
00:33:07,691 --> 00:33:08,495
Scott: Are you gonna go for it?

503
00:33:08,616 --> 00:33:09,741
Scott: How high do you want to make?

504
00:33:10,203 --> 00:33:11,530
Scott: put a stick vertically?

505
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:12,917
Scott: Which you're not allowed to do actually.

506
00:33:12,977 --> 00:33:17,177
Scott: but you know just to get your red guy even higher You're gonna put another elephant up at the top.

507
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:20,468
Rym: So there is one problem with the game.

508
00:33:20,488 --> 00:33:20,910
Rym: Wait a minute.

509
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:21,835
Rym: I'm looking at the back of the box.

510
00:33:21,855 --> 00:33:23,564
Rym: I think it shows a stick vertical.

511
00:33:23,967 --> 00:33:24,590
Rym: It totally does.

512
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:25,374
Rym: There's a vertical stick.

513
00:33:25,394 --> 00:33:28,930
Scott: I think there was a rule that there's like pieces had to be played in a certain way.

514
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,456
Rym: So this is a problem with the game.

515
00:33:30,496 --> 00:33:45,518
Rym: the rules as they are in the printing that we had access to Oh, they're not real well-written enough are ambiguous to the point that they are unusable and we had to make a lot of value judgments as to how Pieces could actually be played.

516
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:48,430
Rym: Can I lay this elephant on his side about about upside down?

517
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:49,953
Rym: Can I put the stick vertically?

518
00:33:50,354 --> 00:33:56,825
Rym: people's people who taught us the game said things were not allowed that are clearly drawn on the back of the box.

519
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:02,547
Rym: So that is a problem and I don't know if there's official errata or anything yet.

520
00:34:02,588 --> 00:34:03,190
Rym: We didn't look into that.

521
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,018
Rym: We kind of just didn't care.

522
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:04,845
Scott: Yeah, it's not.

523
00:34:04,885 --> 00:34:05,350
Scott: it's not a game.

524
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,629
Scott: That's so serious that it's worth your time to look into that.

525
00:34:08,405 --> 00:34:12,206
Scott: But yeah There are some questions like can an elephant be laying on its side or does have to be standing up?

526
00:34:12,286 --> 00:34:15,300
Scott: it can definitely be on Its head or standing up but can it be on its side?

527
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:15,661
Scott: I don't know.

528
00:34:16,184 --> 00:34:17,449
Scott: I put my camel's humps down.

529
00:34:18,192 --> 00:34:24,710
Rym: Oh, yeah, the pieces are well designed though in that they're mostly capable of similar equivalent scores.

530
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:32,723
Scott: Yeah There's like a highly varied an interesting collection of different kinds of meeples that have interesting shapes like, you know You set a camel up.

531
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:35,329
Scott: It's like okay You got this round ball that will roll around.

532
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:39,527
Scott: You just put a camel and put the ball between its humps and now you know the guy standing on that.

533
00:34:39,768 --> 00:34:42,949
Scott: and now you got A guy standing on a ball and you got points, right?

534
00:34:43,534 --> 00:34:46,150
Scott: Or you can be like me and balance a guy standing on a ball like a badass.

535
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:52,126
Rym: Now the game does have an app and it's sort of required but all the app does.

536
00:34:52,226 --> 00:34:58,570
Rym: the only thing it does is Play the timer of how long you have on your turn, but the circus music is essential.

537
00:34:58,771 --> 00:34:59,093
Rym: It plays.

538
00:34:59,113 --> 00:35:00,221
Rym: some did it did it?

539
00:35:00,261 --> 00:35:01,409
Rym: did it style circus music?

540
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:02,733
Rym: Mm-hmm, and it has.

541
00:35:02,953 --> 00:35:23,154
Rym: no it has some symbols like shh and they'll come in in different intervals to sort of tell you when you're running out of time But I will admit I actually would have preferred to just have a countdown timer Telling me exactly how many seconds I had left because I didn't play the game enough times to internalize What the like.

542
00:35:23,516 --> 00:35:25,566
Rym: everyone seemed to be very worried.

543
00:35:25,586 --> 00:35:29,910
Scott: time would run out And I think part of it was that we were keeping the app off to the side.

544
00:35:30,191 --> 00:35:33,305
Scott: We should have put the app front and center on the table so it could be more visible.

545
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:39,891
Rym: true true But still the that gives you a lot more time than you think but you'll have to play it a bunch to Enter.

546
00:35:39,931 --> 00:35:40,412
Rym: never.

547
00:35:40,492 --> 00:35:41,455
Scott: I was never rules.

548
00:35:41,656 --> 00:35:46,610
Scott: I played, you know, somewhat hurriedly not super rushed, but I always came in under the clock.

549
00:35:46,692 --> 00:35:49,902
Scott: It was never At least not as I maybe I'm remembering.

550
00:35:49,942 --> 00:35:52,394
Scott: wrong because I have my memory is awful But I don't remember.

551
00:35:52,414 --> 00:35:56,850
Rym: one time I knocked my thing over and I couldn't rebuild the entire thing in time before the time ran.

552
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:59,582
Scott: Yeah, but you can still build how just get as many points as you can.

553
00:35:59,642 --> 00:36:00,346
Rym: I built something.

554
00:36:00,486 --> 00:36:07,929
Rym: Yeah, wasn't great No, but I feel like I don't know if I want to own this game because I own a lot of games and I don't Know how much play it would get if I tried to play it a lot.

555
00:36:08,071 --> 00:36:12,600
Scott: I feel like this is kind of game where it's like if someone else busted out I'll play it if there's an expansion.

556
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,030
Scott: I definitely want to play it again for sure.

557
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:19,650
Rym: I want to see an expansion that it adds a round where you have to do a dexterity like flick kind of thing.

558
00:36:20,691 --> 00:36:24,810
Scott: But yeah, I feel like if I bought it, it wouldn't get played really very much at all.

559
00:36:26,072 --> 00:36:38,690
Scott: But the one case where I would buy it is if I was in some sort of family situation with small children Anyone who is below a school any situation where you can have a lot of players who are below the skill cap?

560
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,868
Scott: Who will not get perfect?

561
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:50,669
Rym: You know stacking every time like if I hosted game nights for like different people on a regular basis as opposed to just like our Local friends, I would probably have this and bust it out.

562
00:36:51,071 --> 00:36:53,159
Scott: It's the kind of game where like people are.

563
00:36:53,219 --> 00:36:59,590
Scott: I don't know who's gonna want to play this game over and over and over again But you can playing it for the first time is a hell of blast.

564
00:36:59,992 --> 00:37:04,555
Scott: So as long as you keep playing it with different people all the time You definitely want to.

565
00:37:04,575 --> 00:37:07,203
Scott: you know get a copy because it does make a spectacle.

566
00:37:07,224 --> 00:37:09,190
Scott: definitely got to go into a gaming library.

567
00:37:09,351 --> 00:37:10,581
Scott: It's got to go at a convention.

568
00:37:10,642 --> 00:37:13,089
Scott: It's got to go to school It's got to go at a meet-up.

569
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:13,552
Scott: If you

570
00:37:13,632 --> 00:37:22,755
Rym: set this up somewhere like in the middle of a like mid-tier convention or like a meet-up or something It'll gather a crowd of people who will just want to watch Mm-hmm like it

571
00:37:23,077 --> 00:37:28,141
Scott: and people who want to play it like one two three times You know, so children might get hooked on it and keep playing.

572
00:37:28,161 --> 00:37:30,190
Scott: but I think adults will play a few times and be done.

573
00:37:30,319 --> 00:37:36,609
Rym: Yeah I met some people at PAX who had played it to the point that they had completely ruined it and there was no further Replay value at all.

574
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:42,050
Scott: But but I think an expansion that's complex enough could make it fun for quite a while.

575
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:43,057
Rym: I feel like one.

576
00:37:43,077 --> 00:37:49,123
Scott: actually if you added in stuff like you just said like the Looking mode one like flick like round one do a stack.

577
00:37:49,384 --> 00:37:50,568
Rym: round two do a trick.

578
00:37:51,591 --> 00:37:53,096
Rym: Round three do a stack.

579
00:37:53,196 --> 00:37:57,610
Rym: round four the performance that involves a stack and a dexterity move, right?

580
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:00,885
Scott: So I think think the way you do it I think you would set it up like all.

581
00:38:01,228 --> 00:38:05,368
Scott: right You make your stack you score it and then you have to do the trick.

582
00:38:05,509 --> 00:38:07,055
Rym: after The stack.

583
00:38:07,196 --> 00:38:08,803
Scott: your trick is gonna mess up your thing.

584
00:38:08,863 --> 00:38:10,570
Scott: Yeah, or do it separately.

585
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:18,127
Scott: It's like okay you have to make a stack and you have to set up a trick and execute the trick separately like okay I'll make a seesaw here and flick a guy and he has to.

586
00:38:18,228 --> 00:38:22,003
Scott: you know I'll make a human cannonball over here and get a guy to hit another guy.

587
00:38:22,064 --> 00:38:22,224
Scott: good.

588
00:38:22,244 --> 00:38:25,256
Scott: I did it and I'll make my stack Something like that.

589
00:38:25,438 --> 00:38:26,042
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

590
00:38:26,284 --> 00:38:32,868
Scott: but at least as it is Despite its minor flaws in terms maybe add like another act to the circus and that's the area.

591
00:38:32,928 --> 00:38:33,350
Scott: do a trick.

592
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:45,050
Rym: So it's like stack trick in act two and then act three, you know I don't know because the game the game took a while to play but a lot of that was debates over what was legal placement.

593
00:38:45,891 --> 00:38:50,390
Scott: Do again to the point not take long at all because rounds one and two are completely simultaneous.

594
00:38:50,491 --> 00:38:55,726
Scott: So no matter how many players you have round one and two will always take the same amount of time Which is less than 15 minutes.

595
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:58,537
Scott: Yeah If you include the scoring and then the round.

596
00:38:58,618 --> 00:39:03,940
Scott: three is gonna increase linearly based on how many players you have But it only goes up to how many players.

597
00:39:04,001 --> 00:39:05,268
Rym: five maybe two to five.

598
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:14,373
Scott: Yeah So if you have five players, you know, it takes maybe what it's gonna take you another I don't know 30 minutes at the most People.

599
00:39:14,414 --> 00:39:17,530
Scott: so that means that puts this game under an hour with five players.

600
00:39:17,912 --> 00:39:26,130
Rym: I people at PAX explicitly said they do this if they have a four-player game Two of the people will do their performances in the third round simultaneously and each one has a judge.

601
00:39:26,431 --> 00:39:27,176
Rym: Yeah, then they swap.

602
00:39:27,236 --> 00:39:28,182
Scott: that'll speed things up.

603
00:39:28,242 --> 00:39:32,700
Scott: It'll literally cut the time in half But you will lose the enjoyment of seeing everyone's performance.

604
00:39:32,881 --> 00:39:35,570
Rym: Yep, but you do not need the app.

605
00:39:35,711 --> 00:39:36,696
Rym: That is one thing to make clear.

606
00:39:36,716 --> 00:39:38,746
Rym: The app is just a timer XCOM.

607
00:39:38,786 --> 00:39:39,450
Scott: You need the app.

608
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:44,030
Scott: You do not need it in meeple circus because when I said they'll probably want to use I sat down at the table.

609
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:48,033
Rym: I was like, I want to play this game and then the guy who's gonna teach us is like our idea Have the app.

610
00:39:48,173 --> 00:39:50,784
Rym: and immediately I was like, maybe I don't want to play this.

611
00:39:50,804 --> 00:39:51,145
Rym: Mm-hmm.

612
00:39:51,567 --> 00:39:53,575
Rym: But then he was like, no, no No, it's just a timer.

613
00:39:53,755 --> 00:39:53,936
Scott: Yep.

614
00:39:54,137 --> 00:39:55,602
Rym: You don't actually need it.

615
00:39:55,823 --> 00:39:56,505
Rym: Mm-hmm.

616
00:39:56,545 --> 00:39:57,770
Rym: Yeah, it's a pretty good game.

617
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:59,521
Rym: There's a lot of people who probably should buy it.

618
00:39:59,622 --> 00:40:00,105
Rym: It's not one.

619
00:40:00,165 --> 00:40:00,930
Scott: I did the most thing.

620
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:01,652
Scott: I just can't believe.

621
00:40:01,712 --> 00:40:02,515
Scott: no one did this earlier.

622
00:40:03,137 --> 00:40:03,679
Rym: I know right?

623
00:40:03,759 --> 00:40:11,870
Rym: It's A lot of Americana style board games that do this in a very simple.

624
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:16,910
Scott: I'm sorry about this specific thing of make a game out of the fact that everyone stacks meeples all the time.

625
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,675
Scott: Yeah, everyone does this thing.

626
00:40:18,715 --> 00:40:20,260
Scott: Maybe we should make it the right way.

627
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,343
Rym: Why the meeple?

628
00:40:21,424 --> 00:40:23,632
Scott: I've been stacking meeple since 2000.

629
00:40:23,632 --> 00:40:25,429
Scott: Oh something why did it take until?

630
00:40:25,429 --> 00:40:29,527
Scott: 17 for this game to come out?

631
00:40:30,252 --> 00:40:34,050
Rym: But if any of you do have it and you bring it to a PAX, I'll probably play it at least once.

632
00:40:34,271 --> 00:40:35,259
Scott: Yeah, I'd play like once.
