1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,423
Rym: It's Wednesday March 29th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,463 --> 00:00:15,630
Rym: We talk about V for Vendetta the comic.

3
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,557
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:18,844
Rym: Well happily.

5
00:00:18,924 --> 00:00:25,403
Rym: It's warm here again Hooray For a long run about long some abandoned train tracks near us.

6
00:00:25,724 --> 00:00:31,309
Rym: I changed my blanket last night Less warm blanket, and I finally didn't wear my coat to work.

7
00:00:32,313 --> 00:00:34,419
Scott: I brought my coat to work didn't wear it so much.

8
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:35,422
Scott: Yeah, all right.

9
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:41,397
Scott: I installed the beta of ie7 yesterday and And it's ie great.

10
00:00:41,778 --> 00:00:43,202
Scott: It has it has issues.

11
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:46,030
Scott: It's like ie trying to catch up with Firefox.

12
00:00:46,211 --> 00:00:51,832
Scott: It's all I can say about it because I haven't used it that much except one thing is it renders pages still Incorrectly.

13
00:00:52,194 --> 00:00:58,221
Scott: it renders them differently from ie 5 and 6 But it doesn't render them as good as Firefox or correctly.

14
00:00:58,381 --> 00:00:58,903
Scott: so whatever.

15
00:00:59,204 --> 00:01:01,090
Rym: of course it still has that vulnerability.

16
00:01:01,673 --> 00:01:09,402
Scott: It sure does, but there are actually I think two Unofficial fixes for those some vulnerabilities today, so yeah put out by other companies.

17
00:01:09,843 --> 00:01:12,228
Scott: Yep, Microsoft sure isn't gonna put them out right away.

18
00:01:12,449 --> 00:01:19,550
Scott: anyway Microsoft is currently telling people they've known this for a while that ie7 is gonna render pages different.

19
00:01:19,711 --> 00:01:22,901
Scott: We know it does, but there was also that eolos patent.

20
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:29,310
Scott: now if you weren't paying attention to this eolos patent Basically what it means is that ie?

21
00:01:30,652 --> 00:01:34,529
Scott: Is not allowed to do certain things because someone else has a patent on them.

22
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,122
Rym: So this is a bad patent in general.

23
00:01:37,282 --> 00:01:38,227
Scott: It's a very bad patent.

24
00:01:38,247 --> 00:01:38,910
Scott: I disagree with it.

25
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:45,450
Rym: I'm actually on Microsoft's side, but not only that but they're probably gonna go after Firefox and opera next after they finish with Microsoft.

26
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:47,329
Rym: Yeah, well, so this is far from over.

27
00:01:47,671 --> 00:02:01,669
Scott: Yeah, the point of it is is that they got Microsoft and it means that ie7 is going to have to handle active X type Multimedia in the web page in a different way making you click one more time to see it.

28
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:15,804
Rym: Yep, the patent is basically I mean the patent is fairly broad But the one bit of it that I know is that if you use active X or anything like that to use I believe it's applet embed and object those three things.

29
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:17,790
Rym: It can't happen automatically.

30
00:02:18,711 --> 00:02:20,683
Rym: Yeah, it's stupidest patent in the world.

31
00:02:20,743 --> 00:02:21,850
Scott: It's really really dumb.

32
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:37,227
Scott: But anyway, the point is that ie7 is going to not do what this patent says and whatever and Microsoft is pretty much telling everyone you only have X days to change all your web pages So they're not gonna work when we switch everyone to ie7.

33
00:02:37,247 --> 00:02:44,170
Rym: Oh my god And all the people out there who have web pages that'll be affected have no idea what the hell's going on.

34
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,153
Rym: They don't understand this.

35
00:02:45,173 --> 00:02:49,950
Scott: Yeah only like, you know people really close to Microsoft are gonna, you know be told by Microsoft.

36
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:57,250
Scott: They're gonna have to change Everyone else like even big companies, you know, all their customers are gonna get automatic windows updates.

37
00:02:57,614 --> 00:03:04,510
Scott: they're gonna have ie7 and they're gonna go to web pages with it and The web pages aren't gonna work, right?

38
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:12,088
Rym: this is really gonna hurt a lot of small businesses who paid like some kid to make them a web presence a long time ago and They don't know how to fix it or change it.

39
00:03:12,632 --> 00:03:19,682
Scott: It's gonna hurt a lot of companies with a lot of video on their sites Like maybe even like CNN and stuff, you know, who knows.

40
00:03:19,702 --> 00:03:27,319
Rym: it'll also possibly hurt a lot of online stores That make heavy use of active X Anyone who uses Java applets a lot on their pages.

41
00:03:27,339 --> 00:03:35,523
Rym: Yep, which is really gonna affect the people I work for currently People who are selling a Java applet application.

42
00:03:35,864 --> 00:03:37,850
Scott: I know there's like an online office suite.

43
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,950
Scott: That's basically a Java applet, you know, and they're not gonna do too well because whatever.

44
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:48,231
Rym: Yeah, I guess all you can really come away from this with if you don't already know what's going on or aren't very in-depth on The tech?

45
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:48,753
Rym: is that one?

46
00:03:48,773 --> 00:03:48,833
Rym: the?

47
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:59,882
Rym: the way the internet works in a small way is going to change which is going to be very Obvious and apparent to most people because it affects things that they use directly and often You know, there's nothing you can do about it.

48
00:04:00,043 --> 00:04:07,396
Scott: It's just weird that in Firefox I use an extension so that I make it so I have to click one more time To activate.

49
00:04:07,778 --> 00:04:11,290
Rym: that only came up because people use flash and that more for ads than for anything.

50
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,556
Scott: That's what a lot of people are saying.

51
00:04:12,636 --> 00:04:17,978
Scott: is a lot of the people who are gonna be affected by this are people who make Ads and you know ads aren't gonna work.

52
00:04:18,197 --> 00:04:21,410
Rym: I disagree with the patent, but I'm fine with anything that hurts the advertisers.

53
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,075
Scott: Yeah, it's gonna hurt the advertisers.

54
00:04:23,135 --> 00:04:26,927
Scott: The thing is the advertisers are the ones who are gonna lose a lot of money.

55
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,397
Scott: Oh wait That's great.

56
00:04:29,619 --> 00:04:29,881
Rym: Yeah.

57
00:04:30,285 --> 00:04:30,790
Scott: Oh terrific.

58
00:04:31,073 --> 00:04:48,068
Rym: I mean people keep saying that content doesn't exist in a void that no one will make anything on the internet unless they can make money off of it and The fact that Scott and I are here right now With a pile of professional equipment doing a podcast on the air and paying for everything out of our pockets really kind of shoots That shit down.

59
00:04:49,091 --> 00:04:49,392
Scott: You know what?

60
00:04:49,412 --> 00:04:51,178
Scott: I have to say it's true.

61
00:04:51,438 --> 00:04:53,826
Scott: As long as you're talking about people who were born.

62
00:04:53,846 --> 00:04:57,713
Scott: I don't know around 1957 Oh 58.

63
00:04:57,713 --> 00:05:05,210
Scott: Anyone born recently at least in the Western world Isn't an ass and will do shit for free because they like doing it?

64
00:05:06,051 --> 00:05:08,799
Rym: Submit that many people in the Western world are asses.

65
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,170
Scott: they are but mostly the young people are not asses.

66
00:05:12,794 --> 00:05:13,921
Rym: I would disagree with that too.

67
00:05:14,102 --> 00:05:15,350
Rym: I'd say mostly the young geeks.

68
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,643
Rym: We really got to narrow this down cuz.

69
00:05:16,664 --> 00:05:23,057
Rym: uh I would submit that most of the people I grew up with who went to high school with me Would not do anything like this ever.

70
00:05:23,358 --> 00:05:25,144
Scott: Well, they must like doing something.

71
00:05:25,424 --> 00:05:27,250
Scott: Yeah, they would do what they like for free.

72
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,128
Rym: You know what they're gonna do.

73
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,571
Rym: They're all.

74
00:05:28,591 --> 00:05:34,030
Rym: they're all getting married and having kids and settling down and having terrible jobs and they're eventually go free baby factories.

75
00:05:35,155 --> 00:05:36,449
Scott: All right, let's move on.

76
00:05:36,615 --> 00:05:36,786
Rym: Yeah.

77
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,234
Rym: So, uh, you're all.

78
00:05:38,294 --> 00:05:43,047
Rym: you all know that Apple has been sued by a bunch of people over hearing loss and the iPods.

79
00:05:43,448 --> 00:05:43,729
Rym: great.

80
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:46,590
Rym: now I think this is bollocks absolute bollocks.

81
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:53,810
Rym: I mean, it's fairly obvious that listening to music 24/7 on tiny little headphones really really loud can damage your ears.

82
00:05:54,211 --> 00:05:57,079
Scott: Well, the real damage doesn't come from listening to the music.

83
00:05:57,681 --> 00:06:00,850
Scott: It comes from too high decibels for too long a period of time.

84
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:02,769
Rym: Well way comes from listening to it too loud.

85
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:10,174
Rym: the problem is people often listen too loud because they don't realize it's too loud because they've turned it up to drown out all the Ambient noise around them.

86
00:06:10,194 --> 00:06:12,804
Scott: exactly the earbud headphones that come with the iPod.

87
00:06:12,824 --> 00:06:16,970
Scott: There's nothing wrong with the iPod itself It's the headphones don't block out external noise.

88
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:22,390
Scott: So if I wear them and a plane flies over I'll still hear the plane, but now I can't hear the music.

89
00:06:22,913 --> 00:06:23,335
Scott: So what I do?

90
00:06:23,395 --> 00:06:26,110
Scott: I make the music louder and now I can hear the music just fine.

91
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:29,893
Scott: And I don't hear the plane, but I don't realize it's too loud You know.

92
00:06:29,934 --> 00:06:34,490
Scott: and that over time or very rapidly will destroy your hearing completely.

93
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:45,598
Rym: so I guess in one way it is a matter of education, but While people should know about this and while I think a slight education campaign would probably solve this problem Straight up people decided instead to sue Apple.

94
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,246
Rym: Yep, because it's obviously Apple's fault for making a product.

95
00:06:48,286 --> 00:06:48,848
Rym: Everyone loves.

96
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:54,510
Scott: Yeah Man, you can't have an amplifier in the iPod that can be turned up pot.

97
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:57,787
Scott: It can't possibly be turned up to a point at which it will hurt someone ears.

98
00:06:57,827 --> 00:06:58,450
Scott: Well, wait a minute.

99
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:05,330
Scott: What if I plug it into a different speaker a different headphone and now it's not enough amplification because there's more resistance in that?

100
00:07:05,596 --> 00:07:06,008
Scott: Who knows?

101
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,536
Rym: Yeah, plus everyone's ears are different.

102
00:07:08,878 --> 00:07:09,922
Scott: Everyone's ears are different.

103
00:07:09,982 --> 00:07:10,805
Rym: Music is different.

104
00:07:10,886 --> 00:07:11,990
Rym: music might be quieter.

105
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,900
Scott: Yeah, well iTunes actually normalizes all.

106
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,224
Rym: yeah iTunes.

107
00:07:17,244 --> 00:07:18,347
Rym: A lot of people don't use iTunes.

108
00:07:18,387 --> 00:07:19,610
Scott: Yeah, I know it's all crazy.

109
00:07:19,751 --> 00:07:22,511
Scott: So but anyway, you don't have to install it if you don't want to.

110
00:07:22,892 --> 00:07:33,360
Rym: Apple has responded to all this by adding an update to the new firmware and Basically what it does is it allows you to one set a maximum volume that it won't let you go past.

111
00:07:34,302 --> 00:07:39,078
Rym: So basically if you want to make it louder after you do this You have to go through one extra click and then you can make it louder.

112
00:07:39,843 --> 00:07:55,680
Rym: Okay, which I guess I'll remind you and to Parents or anyone really can lock the volume at a maximum And then the only way to make it go above that is to enter a pin Which is just ludicrous, that's just silly.

113
00:07:56,021 --> 00:08:09,760
Rym: I mean, honestly, the only real way to go about this is either to get isolation headphones, which are big and cost money Isolation earbuds which are little and cost even more money or active sound cancellation, which is little and cost even more money.

114
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:14,320
Scott: Well, there's some noise cancelling headphones you can get that aren't so expensive.

115
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,820
Scott: You're not gonna get any of those things for 20 bucks or 10 bucks.

116
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:25,026
Rym: You'll spend at least 80 bucks to get a decent pair of headphones that will let you listen to music for long periods of time Without damaging your hearing.

117
00:08:25,147 --> 00:08:25,389
Rym: Yep.

118
00:08:25,489 --> 00:08:32,799
Scott: I bought a hundred and like $20 Isolation 6i earbuds from Etymotic and they're fantastic.

119
00:08:33,241 --> 00:08:35,631
Scott: Like you put them in and you can't hear shit.

120
00:08:36,232 --> 00:08:38,159
Scott: All you can hear is what comes out of those headphones.

121
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,929
Scott: It's fantastic and they're small.

122
00:08:39,948 --> 00:08:43,947
Scott: They come with a little case thing Well worth the money.

123
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:44,491
Scott: Yep.

124
00:08:44,612 --> 00:08:44,814
Scott: Am I?

125
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:53,779
Scott: hearing is save Things of the day?

126
00:08:54,643 --> 00:08:54,904
Scott: All right.

127
00:08:54,984 --> 00:08:58,336
Scott: This is a thing of the day in Spanish, but there aren't so many Spanish words.

128
00:08:58,357 --> 00:08:59,240
Scott: I think you'll be alright.

129
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,870
Scott: It's las on the matapias.

130
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:07,616
Scott: if you don't know what an onomatopoeia is It's one of those words that sounds like the sound wack.

131
00:09:08,058 --> 00:09:13,939
Scott: Yeah Specifically, these are the onomatopoeias from the old Batman TV show.

132
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:17,133
Rym: You know the terrible one the Adam West live-action.

133
00:09:17,274 --> 00:09:19,435
Scott: terrible god-awful Corny.

134
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,991
Rym: Honestly, I consider Adam West to be the second best Batman.

135
00:09:23,673 --> 00:09:25,518
Scott: Yeah, I guess so right after Michael Keaton.

136
00:09:25,819 --> 00:09:30,093
Scott: Yep I mean those are the Batman's weren't up to par and that man's Batman.

137
00:09:30,434 --> 00:09:30,655
Scott: Actually.

138
00:09:30,715 --> 00:09:32,380
Scott: I heard that the Batman Begins is pretty good.

139
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,284
Scott: I haven't seen it yet though.

140
00:09:33,344 --> 00:09:34,790
Rym: Everyone keeps saying that maybe we should.

141
00:09:35,112 --> 00:09:38,492
Scott: maybe that's that'll become the second best Batman And Adam West will go down to number three.

142
00:09:38,997 --> 00:09:49,726
Scott: Anyway This website here has a picture of every single one of those BAM clank it crash plop slosh Etc.

143
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,679
Scott: That was ever in the TV show?

144
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,099
Rym: Yeah, that's it.

145
00:09:53,401 --> 00:10:02,049
Scott: Not only that it also tells you which ones were used in which episodes including the movie and how many times Each one was used.

146
00:10:02,492 --> 00:10:05,333
Rym: So there are interesting Correlations down there.

147
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:10,007
Scott: Yeah The number one most used one was kapow.

148
00:10:10,188 --> 00:10:10,949
Scott: It was used 50 times.

149
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:20,454
Scott: How it comes in number two at 49 times and after that you get mostly Biff and BAM and Boff Never understood Biff.

150
00:10:20,575 --> 00:10:24,390
Rym: I mean that was in our River City Ransom - yeah, I don't know who came up with that.

151
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:27,198
Scott: Maybe it's like a 70s thing or an 80s thing.

152
00:10:27,218 --> 00:10:29,365
Rym: Yeah, anyone old listen to GeekNights.

153
00:10:29,565 --> 00:10:30,428
Rym: word Biff come from.

154
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:31,993
Scott: Yeah What thing?

155
00:10:32,335 --> 00:10:33,962
Scott: as far as I know Biff is some guy's name?

156
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:35,750
Rym: Yeah some guy from Back to the Future.

157
00:10:36,114 --> 00:10:38,449
Scott: Yeah, that's what I'm talking about All right.

158
00:10:38,751 --> 00:10:41,418
Rym: So I've had in the past two different things.

159
00:10:41,478 --> 00:10:45,729
Rym: the day that involved some form of marching band or drum corps or whatnot.

160
00:10:46,654 --> 00:10:53,262
Rym: Now my thing of the day today is the same kind of deal However, it's special and I think it warrants a thing of the day.

161
00:10:53,303 --> 00:11:15,623
Rym: mentioned now the video I linked to and from that site you can get a link to the whole documentary of which this is only a small part of it and Basically, it's as far as I'm concerned some of the most advanced field and dance or not really dancing but field drill work I've ever seen coupled with the most advanced Stadium full of people holding up cards in a synchronized way work.

162
00:11:15,664 --> 00:11:16,346
Rym: I've ever seen.

163
00:11:16,466 --> 00:11:17,710
Rym: it's absolutely amazing.

164
00:11:18,252 --> 00:11:19,497
Rym: In fact, it's so amazing.

165
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,924
Rym: It's scary.

166
00:11:21,386 --> 00:11:22,410
Scott: It's very scary.

167
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:40,590
Rym: you see this is from North Korea and this is a rally in North Korea and Watching this video and just seeing the absolute level of dedication precision If anyone has any doubts as to how absolutely a hundred percent mobilized and militarized North Korea is watch this video and watch this documentary.

168
00:11:42,011 --> 00:11:48,311
Scott: It just shows you what you know can happen when there aren't any fuckers and everyone goes along with what you try to tell them To do.

169
00:11:48,512 --> 00:11:49,616
Rym: yeah yet at the same time.

170
00:11:49,656 --> 00:11:54,271
Rym: It shows you how easily you can completely dominate an entire Civilization.

171
00:11:54,753 --> 00:11:58,809
Scott: what really scares me the most is that there are a lot of people in this country who?

172
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:00,889
Scott: Would think that that's good?

173
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:08,524
Scott: Like, you know if all their if they got their whole like elementary school full of kids to do that They'd be like, oh look everyone is so well behaved.

174
00:12:08,726 --> 00:12:09,490
Scott: Oh, it's wonderful.

175
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:19,970
Rym: I mean, I guess most people seem to think that North Korea at least most people I talk to around here Not so much the geeks but normal people I run into at work North Korea is this backwater country.

176
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,916
Rym: That's all warlike and we can just ignore it.

177
00:12:22,317 --> 00:12:26,930
Rym: and they don't seem to realize that North Korea is a very industrialized modern nation.

178
00:12:27,594 --> 00:12:30,310
Rym: It just happens to be completely cut off from the rest of the world.

179
00:12:30,712 --> 00:12:36,377
Rym: the people there have no idea what the rest of the world is like and They're just ready for war all the time.

180
00:12:36,738 --> 00:12:40,793
Scott: and we don't really know a lot about what North Korea is like except for the stuff In this documentary.

181
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:44,404
Rym: Yeah, I mean there's very little that's actually known about North Korean culture.

182
00:12:44,745 --> 00:12:50,150
Scott: if you watch this documentary You'll know more about North Korea than most people outside of North Korea.

183
00:12:50,773 --> 00:12:53,007
Rym: I mean the only other thing is I forget what it was called.

184
00:12:53,027 --> 00:13:00,550
Rym: left to ask But Emily a while ago told me about a book Someone who was in North Korea for a while wrote and it describes a lot more about their culture.

185
00:13:00,631 --> 00:13:03,110
Rym: And if I remember it, I'll say it on another show or I'll post it.

186
00:13:03,531 --> 00:13:04,636
Rym: I'll post it in the forums.

187
00:13:05,037 --> 00:13:10,781
Rym: what I remember because it's really interesting and North Korea I'm fascinated and scared of at the same time.

188
00:13:11,142 --> 00:13:15,189
Scott: the scariest thing I think about North Korea Is that it's really less than a hundred years old.

189
00:13:15,781 --> 00:13:29,150
Rym: Yeah I mean North Korea didn't really come into being until the Korean War when for those of you who don't know American history So well, we lost and basically got our asses handed to us and had to give up and the war never ended.

190
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:34,022
Rym: In fact, the North Korean War technically is still going on because South Korea never signed the armistice.

191
00:13:34,323 --> 00:13:35,226
Scott: Yeah armistice.

192
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:36,810
Rym: So technically they're at war.

193
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:39,617
Scott: Imagine this like Hitler, right?

194
00:13:39,657 --> 00:13:44,847
Scott: He took like a decade or so to come around and do all his stuff He wanted to do right and he lost in the end.

195
00:13:45,531 --> 00:13:52,173
Scott: imagine if Hitler didn't try to take over all of Europe in the world and he just stayed in Germany and no one bothered him and He didn't bother anyone.

196
00:13:52,293 --> 00:14:01,727
Scott: and he just militarized and militarized and militarized and he did it for not ten years like or which is about The same amount of time he did have in real life, but for almost 50 years.

197
00:14:03,053 --> 00:14:05,499
Scott: Yeah Yeah, okay.

198
00:14:05,661 --> 00:14:08,376
Scott: That's North Korea Not cool.

199
00:14:08,477 --> 00:14:11,290
Rym: Anyway, watch the video and be amazed and shocked.

200
00:14:12,132 --> 00:14:18,630
Rym: So in light of the fact that the movie came out recently both Scott and I a very also recently read V for Vendetta.

201
00:14:19,356 --> 00:14:28,437
Scott: Yeah, well, I actually bought it a long time Well months ago and I read it then and I read it again like last week and then for the first time in like a few Years, he went to the movie theater.

202
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:29,000
Rym: Yep.

203
00:14:29,482 --> 00:14:31,110
Rym: It was actually kind of a scary experience.

204
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:34,110
Rym: There were ads and there were normal people there in the way.

205
00:14:35,352 --> 00:14:37,117
Scott: It was quite frightening.

206
00:14:37,117 --> 00:14:38,702
Scott: 650 I remember used to be like 450.

207
00:14:38,702 --> 00:14:40,889
Rym: yeah 650 that's freaking great.

208
00:14:40,909 --> 00:14:43,481
Rym: in the city It's like 15 bucks for 650 I can get.

209
00:14:46,192 --> 00:14:56,622
Rym: Wow, I can get like you can't get so much really Dude, I could totally buy even ride the roller coaster in Wildwood once You can't even buy a meal at the diner.

210
00:14:56,642 --> 00:15:04,161
Scott: I Could play DDR 13 times on a 50-cent machine.

211
00:15:04,543 --> 00:15:11,186
Scott: Yeah, six and a half times I can play air hockey 13 times.

212
00:15:11,893 --> 00:15:15,710
Rym: Alright, you know, I would least contend that seeing V for Vendetta in the theater was worth that money.

213
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:21,490
Rym: It was actually a very good movie, but we're not here today to talk about the movie because It's also a comic.

214
00:15:21,691 --> 00:15:28,190
Rym: In fact, the comic came first and we realized that we could talk about the movie comic combined for more than two hours at least.

215
00:15:29,271 --> 00:15:33,930
Scott: Yep, I mean it's real big so it's not hard to talk about a whole lot.

216
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:37,656
Rym: So I guess we'll start today being you know Anime manga comic day.

217
00:15:37,676 --> 00:15:40,390
Rym: a lot of times people seem to forget that that third part is on there.

218
00:15:40,812 --> 00:15:48,600
Rym: We're gonna talk just about V for Vendetta the comic by Alan Moore and David Lloyd Mmm, David Lloyd's the artist and Alan Moore is the writer.

219
00:15:48,821 --> 00:15:49,925
Rym: Yes, Alan Moore.

220
00:15:49,945 --> 00:15:51,310
Rym: You may remember from Watchmen.

221
00:15:51,511 --> 00:15:53,906
Scott: Yeah, he wrote that too, but the artist was different.

222
00:15:54,127 --> 00:15:57,110
Scott: Yep They're both available at the bookstore.

223
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,950
Scott: Obviously at the comic book store, you can buy the whole things in one book.

224
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:06,121
Scott: You don't have to buy a bunch of little separate comic books or anything like that Alright.

225
00:16:06,162 --> 00:16:08,850
Scott: so Sometime dirt at the beginning of this episode.

226
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:14,130
Scott: We're gonna just talk about general stuff and then you're gonna hit the spoiler line and we will warn you.

227
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:19,454
Scott: We'll let you know when the spoiler line is and that's the part where we'll start saying like what happened at the end and all That stuff.

228
00:16:19,494 --> 00:16:26,586
Scott: so if you haven't read it yet Just save this episode on your hard drive or whatever and listen up to that point.

229
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:37,130
Scott: and When you go and buy it and read it because that's what you're gonna do You can come back and listen to the part beyond the spoiler line or if you don't care just keep listening.

230
00:16:37,311 --> 00:16:40,069
Rym: But regardless, we'll give you fair warning when we start to spoil things.

231
00:16:40,552 --> 00:16:44,370
Scott: Oh, yeah, if you don't plan to read it ever, you know might as well keep listening.

232
00:16:44,931 --> 00:16:48,502
Rym: Yeah, at least watch the movie before you listen to the spoiler parts here.

233
00:16:49,244 --> 00:16:51,370
Scott: Yeah, because they'll probably mention something about that.

234
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,957
Rym: We'll probably talking about the movie tomorrow.

235
00:16:54,258 --> 00:16:54,499
Rym: Yep.

236
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,688
Scott: Well two episodes kind of crazy.

237
00:16:57,909 --> 00:16:58,150
Scott: All right.

238
00:16:59,337 --> 00:17:10,297
Scott: so V for Vendetta is a story about a Theoretical future Alternate future kind of thing.

239
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:12,727
Rym: Yeah, a very 1984 ish kind of future.

240
00:17:12,747 --> 00:17:13,310
Scott: Yeah, it's more.

241
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,088
Scott: It's more like an alternate present because it was like written in the 80s.

242
00:17:16,651 --> 00:17:20,989
Scott: So it's like what it could be like now if it could gone differently back then.

243
00:17:21,571 --> 00:17:22,598
Rym: Now the basic premise.

244
00:17:22,898 --> 00:17:40,573
Rym: well, there are a lot of ways to talk about the basic premise but plot wise in terms of what happens the basic premise is that there is a 1984 ish world order at least in Britain and there is a man who for various reasons seeks to undermine this world order and Through

245
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:44,470
Scott: very very clever means sort of Hannibal ish in nature.

246
00:17:44,611 --> 00:17:48,902
Rym: I would say transhumanist I believe could be a term for this Because he's very.

247
00:17:49,448 --> 00:17:56,193
Scott: you know Hannibal is so smart that they can't get him and he does things in such incredibly clever ways that no one can possibly Stop him.

248
00:17:56,374 --> 00:17:59,390
Rym: but also in the sense that Hannibal wasn't entirely human.

249
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:08,389
Rym: he had transcended some of the aspects that make a human human and Thus these is motives methods and means were alien to the humans who were trying to stop it.

250
00:18:09,632 --> 00:18:16,229
Rym: And actually V for Vendetta very much follows the same kind of transhumanist ideas along with all of the actual plot going on.

251
00:18:17,052 --> 00:18:23,356
Rym: I think if that's it that might be in there somewhere if it's in there very strongly in a point that I don't want to Talk about until the spoiler section.

252
00:18:23,999 --> 00:18:26,890
Scott: Oh you think it's in there strongly because I didn't see it so blatantly.

253
00:18:27,113 --> 00:18:28,290
Rym: I think it's in there strongly.

254
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:28,632
Rym: I didn't.

255
00:18:28,933 --> 00:18:36,782
Rym: I didn't really realize it until the end when I don't want to spoil it now But we'll talk about it in the second now because for me I only saw like a little tiny spot where it might fit in well.

256
00:18:36,803 --> 00:18:37,827
Rym: I'll point out a scene later.

257
00:18:37,847 --> 00:18:44,904
Rym: all right But anyway aside from that aspect of it It's also based very much on the idea of Guy Fawkes.

258
00:18:45,346 --> 00:18:51,220
Scott: now if you're not from Albion you might not know who Guy Fawkes is.

259
00:18:51,341 --> 00:18:55,435
Rym: yeah in fact when we saw the movie they actually Showed the legend.

260
00:18:55,495 --> 00:19:04,302
Scott: well not the legend really but the story of the first thing in the movie was the story of Guy Fawkes for People who didn't already know it aka Americans yes, but we already knew it.

261
00:19:04,342 --> 00:19:05,104
Scott: so we kind of noticed.

262
00:19:05,285 --> 00:19:07,994
Rym: remember remember the 5th of November Mm-hmm?

263
00:19:08,376 --> 00:19:09,683
Scott: what had the story of Guy Fawkes?

264
00:19:09,724 --> 00:19:10,588
Scott: is that on November 5th?

265
00:19:11,497 --> 00:19:19,330
Scott: a long time ago This guy named Guy Fawkes and a bunch of his followers and a bunch of his followers were all anarchists of some stripe.

266
00:19:19,734 --> 00:19:29,188
Scott: Yep, they took Literally barrels of gunpowder, and they snuck them under the Parliament building in London And they were going to blow it up.

267
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,119
Rym: And they were at least as far as history shows.

268
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,516
Rym: they were caught at pretty much the last minute and stopped Like literally.

269
00:19:36,616 --> 00:19:42,603
Scott: these guys had gunpowder in barrels under the building And then the police or equivalent came in and stopped them.

270
00:19:43,045 --> 00:19:45,758
Scott: you know like shot him or well No, I think he was hanged shot him.

271
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:47,487
Rym: No they didn't shoot him.

272
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:49,714
Scott: yeah They got him.

273
00:19:49,835 --> 00:19:50,377
Scott: they were they.

274
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,150
Scott: you notice the Parliament building is still in London.

275
00:19:53,270 --> 00:20:02,199
Rym: It's still there now that if you don't know anything about Guy Fawkes read up a bit before you read this comic because Guy Fawkes plays prevalently in this.

276
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,603
Rym: it basically the.

277
00:20:03,764 --> 00:20:05,770
Rym: the comic begins with the bombing of Parliament.

278
00:20:06,611 --> 00:20:07,273
Scott: That's like the.

279
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:11,306
Scott: Guy Fawkes is like the number one of all the ideas in this whole comic.

280
00:20:11,426 --> 00:20:12,610
Scott: Guy Fawkes is number one.

281
00:20:12,952 --> 00:20:13,275
Scott: That's like.

282
00:20:13,396 --> 00:20:29,050
Rym: it's about Guy Fawkes Very much Guy Fawkes and the ideas behind him at least behind him from a from an external kind of academic perspective Because the actual Guy Fawkes his motives might have or probably a lot less They were now, but yeah, that's not the point.

283
00:20:29,231 --> 00:20:32,822
Rym: I don't think that Guy Fawkes had the same ideas in mind that V does.

284
00:20:32,942 --> 00:20:44,930
Scott: it's not about Guy Fawkes in a Biographical way it is about Guy Fawkes in An idea sort of way yes, but at least read the Wikipedia on Guy Fawkes.

285
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:48,903
Scott: So well let's talk about the different characters in this thing.

286
00:20:49,426 --> 00:20:51,713
Scott: the the main character Pretty main.

287
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:59,102
Scott: the main character even though it might not be from their point of view is V and He's this guy who wears a Guy Fawkes mask.

288
00:20:59,323 --> 00:21:02,476
Rym: well even if he's not the main character He is the motive force in the plot.

289
00:21:02,656 --> 00:21:03,499
Rym: Yeah, definitely.

290
00:21:03,941 --> 00:21:06,850
Scott: He wears a Guy Fawkes mask so you can't see his face.

291
00:21:07,051 --> 00:21:07,796
Scott: He has like a cape.

292
00:21:07,936 --> 00:21:10,230
Scott: he's sort of like a superhero, but he doesn't have any superpowers.

293
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,962
Rym: He's a superhero in the same way that Batman is a superhero.

294
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:13,404
Scott: Yeah, he's just.

295
00:21:13,444 --> 00:21:25,066
Scott: he's just a badass dude and He goes about you know doing terrorist things in this sort of 1984 scary Super Fascist Britain.

296
00:21:25,329 --> 00:21:31,730
Rym: yeah And if you think that me telling you that he blows up parliament is a spoiler that happens on like the sixth page.

297
00:21:32,474 --> 00:21:44,495
Rym: yeah, I mean the story starts with V and The other character you meet right away is this girl Evie, and she is poor and destitute and needs money And has decided to prostitute herself.

298
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:50,154
Rym: mm-hmm, so she wanders out into the street breaking curfew to do this horrible thing She's never done before.

299
00:21:50,194 --> 00:21:54,236
Rym: you know prostitute for money and to make a long story short she runs into some.

300
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,245
Rym: they call them finger men, but basically police.

301
00:21:56,708 --> 00:22:02,283
Rym: yeah and Police in this 1984 fascist society are quite horrible.

302
00:22:02,343 --> 00:22:04,350
Scott: I guess they're very horrible.

303
00:22:04,632 --> 00:22:09,336
Rym: They decide they're going to rape her and then kill her because according to the law That's what they can do whatever they want to her.

304
00:22:09,356 --> 00:22:09,798
Rym: they caught her.

305
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:10,983
Scott: yeah, it's fascism.

306
00:22:11,023 --> 00:22:14,780
Scott: imagine if you know you snuck out In Germany at night and rent some SS guys.

307
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,403
Scott: It's like that

308
00:22:15,764 --> 00:22:28,284
Rym: yep, so then suddenly a crazy guy and a guy fox mask spouting prose appears and in the blink of an eye he kills all of them or just about all of them and saves the girl

309
00:22:28,745 --> 00:22:28,866
Scott: mm-hmm

310
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:34,350
Rym: and Shortly after that he takes her to a rooftop where he shows her the Parliament building.

311
00:22:34,511 --> 00:22:39,129
Scott: And then it explodes and he did it and he admits to it, and he's like look what I did we.

312
00:22:40,551 --> 00:22:45,290
Rym: That's one thing I really love about this book is how direct V is throughout the whole thing.

313
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:48,206
Rym: I mean someone asked him like did you blow up that building?

314
00:22:48,226 --> 00:22:48,668
Rym: He's like yeah?

315
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,199
Rym: Are you going to kill this person?

316
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:51,561
Rym: Yes?

317
00:22:51,742 --> 00:22:52,467
Rym: Are you going to kill me?

318
00:22:52,688 --> 00:22:52,890
Rym: Yes?

319
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:59,669
Scott: That's one thing that really sets this apart from pretty much everything else I've ever seen is is a guy in the mask.

320
00:23:00,191 --> 00:23:05,066
Scott: We the only thing that's really secret about him is what he looks like under there.

321
00:23:05,267 --> 00:23:06,270
Scott: everything else about him.

322
00:23:06,994 --> 00:23:08,990
Scott: He just he's just wide open.

323
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:14,497
Scott: It's not like in a Gundam where there's a guy with a mask and he's all secretive and whoo There's no mystery to be.

324
00:23:14,517 --> 00:23:16,026
Scott: he's just like yeah, I blew it up.

325
00:23:16,126 --> 00:23:16,971
Scott: Yes, what I'm gonna Do?

326
00:23:17,011 --> 00:23:18,137
Scott: yeah, what you can do about it?

327
00:23:18,277 --> 00:23:20,810
Rym: I can't think of a time where he lies in the entire comic.

328
00:23:20,891 --> 00:23:21,638
Scott: No, he doesn't lie.

329
00:23:21,699 --> 00:23:27,105
Rym: if someone I mean there's like me There's a scene where he's with a person and the person literally asks him are you going to kill me?

330
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:33,251
Rym: Yeah, he says yes Yep, hey, you can't get more direct than that He's.

331
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:43,909
Scott: it's the total opposite of what's normally going on because you know he has the appearance The physical appearance of being mysterious and secretive yet is the exact opposite.

332
00:23:44,532 --> 00:23:45,036
Scott: It's as you see.

333
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:46,606
Scott: this gets not like you know.

334
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:52,092
Scott: sometimes There'll be the mysterious guy who doesn't say anything and you see him in the corner like in Half-life.

335
00:23:52,113 --> 00:23:52,977
Scott: you see the g-man.

336
00:23:52,997 --> 00:23:53,842
Scott: you know it's like there.

337
00:23:53,882 --> 00:23:55,410
Scott: He is he barely appears.

338
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:56,996
Scott: He says some cryptic things.

339
00:23:57,076 --> 00:24:02,190
Scott: right this guy says a lot of prose, and it's you know you have to read it But it's actually very relevant.

340
00:24:02,311 --> 00:24:11,170
Rym: I mean a lot of times you'll see a comic where you know someone quotes a long Quotation from something and you kind of just glaze over it or maybe you figure out what they're quoting and then you ignore it.

341
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:16,070
Rym: It all really fits in well, and it's worth it to read every word in this comic.

342
00:24:16,952 --> 00:24:18,744
Scott: Yeah, it takes a long time to read this comic.

343
00:24:18,785 --> 00:24:25,730
Rym: relative to others I mean I mean I kind of blew through it But that's because I read it in a go right before we went to see the movie.

344
00:24:26,152 --> 00:24:28,323
Rym: I finished the comic and then 10 minutes later.

345
00:24:28,363 --> 00:24:29,690
Rym: We were in the car driving to the theater.

346
00:24:30,271 --> 00:24:34,403
Rym: So Evie basically she's probably the other main character.

347
00:24:34,904 --> 00:24:38,074
Scott: Yeah, if you want to put the point of view somewhere It's it's Evie.

348
00:24:38,315 --> 00:24:38,817
Scott: That's you know.

349
00:24:38,837 --> 00:24:39,459
Scott: It's that's.

350
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:46,208
Scott: the story is mostly not 100% But mostly from what she sees and what she hears and that's yeah the story is driven by V.

351
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:51,363
Rym: It is it affects Evie and the only other real perspective you get is there.

352
00:24:51,463 --> 00:24:57,986
Rym: you know policemen and investigators dealing with all this and One of those investigators you follow his perspective around a lot too.

353
00:24:58,167 --> 00:24:58,327
Scott: Yeah.

354
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:04,590
Scott: He's the guy There's the nose the finger the eyes whatever you know there's different government departments for each part of the face.

355
00:25:04,993 --> 00:25:14,430
Scott: I think it's eyes nose ears mouth I think that and the finger and this is the guy who works for the nose because the nose of the detectives They find out the information.

356
00:25:14,591 --> 00:25:16,096
Scott: So that's the guy that's.

357
00:25:16,196 --> 00:25:20,350
Scott: you're kind of with a little bit more than the other guys who are just you know.

358
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,324
Rym: Yeah, I think they're all the departments in the 1984 government.

359
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:24,762
Scott: Yeah, there's a guy who's the head of the finger.

360
00:25:24,822 --> 00:25:25,830
Scott: the head of those are the guys.

361
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:32,225
Rym: They're the head of each department you're following and one of those guys I guess he's the closest thing to a good guy because I mean right away.

362
00:25:32,285 --> 00:25:33,210
Rym: They say he's the villain.

363
00:25:33,551 --> 00:25:39,874
Rym: Yeah, of course, but in terms of a classical story from the side of the fascist government There's really only.

364
00:25:39,894 --> 00:25:43,769
Rym: the only good guy is the one detective who's trying to stop V the terrorist mm-hmm.

365
00:25:44,431 --> 00:25:45,795
Scott: Yeah, that's the head of the nose.

366
00:25:46,055 --> 00:25:46,617
Scott: What's his name?

367
00:25:46,657 --> 00:25:47,038
Scott: I forget.

368
00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:47,820
Rym: Oh, I forget.

369
00:25:47,901 --> 00:25:52,637
Rym: actually it's funny, but I forgot almost all the characters names Constantly while reading it.

370
00:25:52,938 --> 00:25:55,290
Rym: yet that didn't seem to affect in any way my understanding of that.

371
00:25:55,671 --> 00:25:59,524
Scott: Some of that has in the comic has to do with the art because the art is sort of this.

372
00:25:59,846 --> 00:26:05,405
Scott: it looks like watercolors Almost you know, I think was printed in newspapers or not?

373
00:26:05,585 --> 00:26:06,829
Scott: a super high-quality man.

374
00:26:06,849 --> 00:26:12,390
Rym: Yes I mean the people's hair color changes and things change all the time and it's really hard to follow what's going on.

375
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:22,170
Scott: If you just look at the picture, that's another reason I think it takes so long, you know as opposed to reading like a crap Marvel comic, you know Where everyone looks exactly the same as they did in the previous panel.

376
00:26:22,391 --> 00:26:25,817
Rym: But yet at the same time it had an interesting effect at least for me I mean while I was reading.

377
00:26:25,857 --> 00:26:26,985
Scott: oh, yeah, I definitely like it.

378
00:26:27,066 --> 00:26:28,313
Scott: I'm just so yeah But I mean

379
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:41,242
Rym: the interesting effect I noticed was that as I read the art was there but it was in the background of the text and I'd read the text and Instead of like the Watchmen as I read it I puzzled over every image and I looked in the background and I looked

380
00:26:41,302 --> 00:26:43,149
Scott: at all this stuff in the background of the watch.

381
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:47,130
Rym: in This I was picturing all the action in my head and I was barely looking at the art.

382
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,243
Rym: The art was just like a backdrop for what I was thinking.

383
00:26:49,263 --> 00:26:56,516
Scott: Mm-hmm I mean it's important because sometimes they'll make like an important frame or two Where there's something like symbolic like.

384
00:26:56,796 --> 00:27:01,892
Scott: you'll see him because you know guy the guy Fox mask always looks the same no matter what It's like.

385
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:10,942
Scott: they'll always zoom in on his face and you'll you know at the like the perfect time and he'll be smiling because the mask Is smiling even though that doesn't fit with what's going on?

386
00:27:11,183 --> 00:27:21,561
Scott: You know, it's like ooh, they'll just use that a lot And they'll use some other visual things here and there, you know, especially when stuff's blowing up Or when people are dying and such.

387
00:27:21,983 --> 00:27:23,250
Rym: now the basic conflict.

388
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:33,390
Rym: Oh, this is the thing that everyone who reviews this seems to say but it seems to be mostly true that The basic conflict in V for Vendetta is between the forces of anarchy and the forces of fascism.

389
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,236
Scott: That's pretty much it.

390
00:27:35,316 --> 00:27:41,899
Rym: This is to the two most extreme Ideas and put them in direct direct conflict.

391
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:42,540
Scott: Yep.

392
00:27:43,363 --> 00:27:43,483
Rym: Now.

393
00:27:43,543 --> 00:27:45,809
Rym: It's actually much more subtle and varied than that.

394
00:27:46,716 --> 00:27:47,689
Scott: Oh, there's more to it.

395
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:52,930
Rym: But yeah, but I mean to say I mean saying I was making a broad statement like that doesn't really do justice to the comic.

396
00:27:53,432 --> 00:28:03,726
Scott: No, well, I mean that's one of the things it's about being such a. you know A bit you can make one little comic that you know Like a normal-sized comic book about anarchy versus fascism and that's all you would need.

397
00:28:04,107 --> 00:28:04,790
Scott: but it's so big.

398
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,587
Scott: So that's just one of the things in it.

399
00:28:07,211 --> 00:28:10,902
Rym: You know anarchy versus fascism was the way it seems to go.

400
00:28:10,982 --> 00:28:27,450
Rym: is that not anarchy in the sense of you know, chaotic No government crazy anarchy, but more in the sense of self-determination that people should make whatever drama they're gonna make on their own and not let a government or Authority make that drama for them and stifle their own lives?

401
00:28:27,851 --> 00:28:34,279
Scott: Yeah, it's not the anarchy that you know, people seem to think when you say anarchy Which means everyone run around doing whatever they want.

402
00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:36,550
Rym: Yeah, probably not the anarchy the actual guy Fox wanted.

403
00:28:36,812 --> 00:28:42,017
Scott: No, it's the anarchy that you know, people who call themselves Anarchists will say can actually exist.

404
00:28:42,037 --> 00:28:43,722
Scott: That's the kind of thing which I'm still.

405
00:28:44,204 --> 00:28:49,413
Rym: I don't know if it can exist or can't but that's That's a Thursday episode there But that's it.

406
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:51,419
Scott: that's what they're talking about in the book.

407
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,650
Scott: is the anarchy that people who call themselves anarchists talk about?

408
00:28:55,335 --> 00:29:11,145
Rym: Yeah, and basically just the idea that Authority and fascism or any sort of authority that has its power Not through the will of the people but through the will of but through force itself Really can never do good no matter how good the intent is.

409
00:29:11,566 --> 00:29:14,556
Rym: by stifling people's freedom You take away everything and nothing else matters.

410
00:29:14,998 --> 00:29:28,679
Rym: Mm-hmm It's a testament to one thing it's a testament to the idea that freedom is the most important thing that can ever be had the free or die and Never said live for your diet anywhere in there.

411
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,810
Rym: Yeah, but it makes a lot of other very quotable quotes.

412
00:29:32,112 --> 00:29:32,717
Scott: Oh, it sure does.

413
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:34,230
Rym: This is quite a quotable comic.

414
00:29:34,371 --> 00:29:43,590
Scott: I also think it has to do with the fact it's it's British and it seems to Call upon like history of Europe and it doesn't travel over to America at all.

415
00:29:43,851 --> 00:29:45,337
Rym: Yeah, which we're fine with.

416
00:29:45,398 --> 00:29:50,418
Rym: but honestly if you don't know much about British history at all I suggest you brush up a little before you read this.

417
00:29:50,478 --> 00:29:56,457
Scott: Yeah and brush up on important buildings in London So you'll know which ones they're talking about.

418
00:29:56,618 --> 00:30:03,329
Rym: at least that's not too important because they I mean, you'll know Oh, that's obviously an important building or I'm sure everyone knows what Big Ben is.

419
00:30:03,591 --> 00:30:05,982
Scott: Well, but you know, you want to know what Big Ben sounds like.

420
00:30:06,324 --> 00:30:07,469
Scott: Yeah, some people don't know.

421
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:13,325
Scott: Yeah, but as soon as you know as soon as you hear a wave of what Big Ben sounds like you'd be like Oh, I've heard that I get it.

422
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:18,182
Scott: But yeah, like they'll show pictures in the comic of different buildings and things and it.

423
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:23,022
Scott: they'll like go to them or you know You'll want to know like sort of how close they are to each other.

424
00:30:23,043 --> 00:30:24,290
Scott: that can sometimes help you out.

425
00:30:25,251 --> 00:30:27,801
Rym: Now there's one thing that kind of bothered me about it.

426
00:30:27,821 --> 00:30:28,444
Rym: Not about the story.

427
00:30:28,464 --> 00:30:31,172
Rym: This is a very meta observation.

428
00:30:31,252 --> 00:30:38,796
Rym: but in reading the comic there are a few characters who speak in either cockney or Like thick Welsh accents.

429
00:30:38,876 --> 00:30:40,301
Scott: Yeah, is that one gangster, dude?

430
00:30:40,663 --> 00:30:42,730
Rym: I had no idea what the hell that guy was saying.

431
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:44,889
Scott: Either you're not alone.

432
00:30:45,352 --> 00:30:46,558
Rym: I mean the way they wrote.

433
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,885
Rym: I'm not gonna even dig through.

434
00:30:47,925 --> 00:30:50,838
Scott: I'm holding the comic in my hand Like the three-quarters of the way through that guy.

435
00:30:50,858 --> 00:30:55,277
Rym: but the way they write a cockney accent and I think it was on purpose you Really can't understand what he's saying.

436
00:30:55,538 --> 00:30:56,945
Rym: Even if you sit there and puzzle over it.

437
00:30:57,025 --> 00:30:57,789
Rym: It's just it's not.

438
00:30:57,849 --> 00:31:00,242
Scott: well No, if I read it slow enough, I can tell what.

439
00:31:00,282 --> 00:31:02,650
Rym: yes, if you read it that slowly though It's just not worth it at that.

440
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:07,729
Scott: Yeah, I just get that I got the general idea of what he's saying because it's really not that important and there's only like one or two people.

441
00:31:08,773 --> 00:31:10,030
Rym: Yeah, I wonder if that was intentional.

442
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:14,629
Rym: I mean, I wonder if Alan Moore realized that it's almost impossible to read that with any speed.

443
00:31:15,533 --> 00:31:16,195
Scott: I have no idea.

444
00:31:16,255 --> 00:31:17,499
Scott: Maybe British people can read it.

445
00:31:18,061 --> 00:31:19,426
Rym: Well, you know what.

446
00:31:19,526 --> 00:31:22,737
Rym: we've got several Albion ish listeners out there.

447
00:31:23,239 --> 00:31:28,902
Rym: So if you've read V for Vendetta, we just have a simple question Can you understand easily what they were writing there?

448
00:31:29,484 --> 00:31:30,369
Scott: Maybe they can who knows?

449
00:31:31,171 --> 00:31:39,947
Scott: I mean think about this if someone writes a comic where people have a southern accent or or A Minnesota accent, can we tell what they're writing?

450
00:31:40,468 --> 00:31:41,270
Rym: Yeah, I don't know.

451
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:42,690
Rym: I mean it depends on how it's written.

452
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,538
Scott: I sometimes I can and sometimes I can.

453
00:31:44,578 --> 00:31:56,744
Rym: I've seen Cockney and Welsh and things like that Represented by other authors in other ways and I've usually been able to read it and it seems like just the way it was Done that the letters that were used in this representation of it.

454
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:58,390
Rym: We're just very difficult to parse.

455
00:31:58,851 --> 00:32:02,646
Rym: You take a bunch of comics and you put them in spine.

456
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:05,467
Rym: speech bubbles Get in.

457
00:32:06,971 --> 00:32:11,870
Rym: We be no offense to all the Welshman out there, but yeah whales is actually cool.

458
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,156
Scott: They got a dragon on their flag.

459
00:32:13,256 --> 00:32:15,908
Scott: Yeah that haha, you know, I'll trade flags.

460
00:32:16,249 --> 00:32:17,514
Scott: Sorry Yeah.

461
00:32:17,795 --> 00:32:18,097
Scott: All right.

462
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:19,864
Scott: We're gonna put the spoiler line here.

463
00:32:19,884 --> 00:32:21,370
Scott: I think we put the spoiler line here.

464
00:32:21,735 --> 00:32:22,730
Rym: Yeah, I think it's about time.

465
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:32,068
Rym: So from this moment on in this current episode if you don't want V for V for Vendetta to be spoiled You should probably stop listening right now.

466
00:32:33,935 --> 00:32:35,730
Scott: All right, so let's summarize the whole comic.

467
00:32:36,223 --> 00:32:43,515
Rym: All right Obviously everyone who's still with us has read V for Vendetta or at least seen the movie or doesn't care and if you don't care You might be a little lost.

468
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,284
Scott: All right, so starts out.

469
00:32:45,405 --> 00:32:49,677
Scott: He blows up Parliament and You have the book so I forget exactly what.

470
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,623
Scott: next the second chapter starts with that music.

471
00:32:52,065 --> 00:32:58,190
Rym: Yeah, and then he starts murdering Everyone who worked at Larkhill, which was basically a concentration camp, right?

472
00:32:58,331 --> 00:33:02,870
Scott: So V is this guy who we don't know his past and he doesn't remember it either.

473
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:05,690
Scott: But he remembers when he was at the concentration camp.

474
00:33:05,931 --> 00:33:14,038
Scott: Basically, they were doing medical experiments and he was a guy who during the medical experiments didn't die Like everyone else did if he was weird.

475
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:16,810
Scott: He was a weird case and he was in cell number five.

476
00:33:16,951 --> 00:33:19,468
Rym: He was like whoa Roman numeral five V.

477
00:33:20,672 --> 00:33:23,289
Scott: There's a lot of V's in here a lot of V's.

478
00:33:23,511 --> 00:33:37,495
Rym: Yes, and it may you may not notice it in the comic itself but when you watch the movie they take some lines from the comic and put him in the movie and I don't think I've ever heard a man use that many words that start with the letter V in one cohen I don't remember.

479
00:33:37,596 --> 00:33:40,110
Scott: I wasn't sure when he was saying that I was like all that fits.

480
00:33:40,231 --> 00:33:44,690
Scott: But when he was saying that in the movie all those words with V's was that actually in the comic?

481
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:50,301
Rym: I don't think it was in the comic word for word Notice it but very similar lines were all over the place.

482
00:33:50,642 --> 00:33:54,710
Scott: Yeah, it also talked about that tomorrow Movie stuff anyway.

483
00:33:55,512 --> 00:34:02,449
Scott: so he begins killing all the people who worked at this concentration camp who are now all about society, you know.

484
00:34:02,469 --> 00:34:10,790
Scott: and Killing some of them has special effects Like the government has this computer called fate which is basically the thing that runs the government.

485
00:34:10,951 --> 00:34:13,848
Scott: It makes all the decisions and handles all the logistics of the fascists.

486
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:18,750
Rym: Yeah It's also the only plot thing in the comic that I didn't like and I didn't really think needed to be there.

487
00:34:19,094 --> 00:34:20,449
Scott: Oh, I liked it anyway.

488
00:34:22,887 --> 00:34:25,478
Scott: And Of course the guy who is like the the king.

489
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,103
Scott: what do they actually call him in the book?

490
00:34:27,205 --> 00:34:27,585
Rym: the leader?

491
00:34:27,907 --> 00:34:28,710
Scott: the leader, right?

492
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:36,734
Scott: He is the one who uses the computer and he's actually sort of in love with it like Actually, yeah It's this whole side plot.

493
00:34:37,295 --> 00:34:47,250
Scott: like the leader of the country is a complete virgin and he's he actually says things like I don't I've never had any loins, but I don't need any because I got you my wonderful computer fate.

494
00:34:48,051 --> 00:34:50,409
Scott: So the first guy he kills is the voice of fate.

495
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:56,350
Scott: He's basically this guy who goes on the radio like on every few hours a day and gives the news.

496
00:34:56,831 --> 00:34:57,215
Rym: Well, I don't.

497
00:34:57,416 --> 00:34:59,810
Rym: I don't think we need to summarize the whole comic.

498
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,978
Rym: Yeah I'm not everyone here because you I think you're.

499
00:35:02,018 --> 00:35:02,701
Rym: so far you're some.

500
00:35:02,741 --> 00:35:05,253
Rym: you've summarized almost nothing and if you go through it You're going.

501
00:35:05,273 --> 00:35:07,169
Rym: we're gonna summarize the whole comic over the next 10 minutes.

502
00:35:07,811 --> 00:35:09,089
Scott: Okay, so let me try to pick it up.

503
00:35:09,712 --> 00:35:11,699
Rym: I mean, I think we can just summarize the basic plot points.

504
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:14,670
Rym: He kills all of these people who worked at the concentration camp

505
00:35:14,891 --> 00:35:15,091
Scott: Yep,

506
00:35:15,733 --> 00:35:27,590
Rym: and then he continues to enact his terrorism and the people start to take notice and he basically Not directly, but indirectly leads the revolution that brings about the downfall of all authority

507
00:35:28,072 --> 00:35:28,313
Scott: Mm-hmm

508
00:35:29,116 --> 00:35:30,100
Rym: to put it very succinctly.

509
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:41,692
Scott: Yeah now Evie the second character She starts out, you know almost getting raped by the finger men and then V saves her and brings him to her brings her To his hideout.

510
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,862
Rym: now, she is definitely presented as a very weak character.

511
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:51,465
Rym: Yeah, I mean physically emotionally mentally She is just weak and that over the course of the book.

512
00:35:51,485 --> 00:35:58,989
Rym: I mean, there's the point at which V Actually tortures her for a good while and this is the first transhumanist.

513
00:35:59,732 --> 00:36:12,770
Rym: Well other than the obvious V transhumanism bit that I noticed that basically, you know I mean, you know he tortured her and he put her through all that and then she comes out and she realized that it was him and Then she goes up onto the roof and I believe the word she uses is trend figures.

514
00:36:13,211 --> 00:36:24,144
Rym: she transcends the the fear and the pain and all those all those useless or dangerous emotions and Basically transcends an aspect of humanity the same way that V had.

515
00:36:24,164 --> 00:36:35,109
Rym: Mm-hmm Well and as a result of this transcendence, she basically becomes V's protege Follower disciple what-have-you and I mean she becomes the one who actually enacts his plan at the end.

516
00:36:35,671 --> 00:36:39,664
Scott: Yeah, I mean at the end, you know after up V dies dun-dun-dun.

517
00:36:39,844 --> 00:36:40,868
Scott: Yeah, that's a spoiler line.

518
00:36:40,888 --> 00:36:47,007
Scott: I can say that She actually becomes V after he's dead and then picks up a new person to be, you know her protege.

519
00:36:47,047 --> 00:36:51,537
Rym: It's like, ah Yep, and I thought it was really interesting Was really like.

520
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:53,110
Scott: it's not what you I expected at all.

521
00:36:53,130 --> 00:37:01,101
Rym: like now the detective surprisingly enough the good detective the one who was actually trying to find the truth and Trying to stop V just because V was a killer.

522
00:37:01,262 --> 00:37:04,795
Rym: Yeah the nose guy he Transcends in a different way.

523
00:37:04,815 --> 00:37:08,670
Scott: Yeah, he ends up going to the concentration camp after all his detective thing.

524
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:14,870
Rym: Yeah, just like in in all the Hannibal movies when in order to catch Hannibal you have to think like Hannibal and become Hannibal.

525
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,843
Rym: Yeah Because the only way to catch a trans humanist is to become a trans humanist.

526
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:19,746
Scott: and he was like.

527
00:37:19,786 --> 00:37:22,622
Scott: he even said like I'm gonna Have to know this guy and it scares the hell out.

528
00:37:22,643 --> 00:37:23,650
Rym: I love how they did this.

529
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,660
Rym: He actually I mean he actually went to the concentration camp.

530
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:37,426
Rym: He did a bunch of LSD took LSD and he basically went insane and mentally went through everything that V went through and Then he realized what V was up to and he caught him fair and square.

531
00:37:37,446 --> 00:37:38,670
Scott: He went right back down.

532
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,461
Scott: He's like, I know where the hell you are now.

533
00:37:40,481 --> 00:37:41,969
Scott: I got you and then he shot him.

534
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:49,028
Rym: Yeah, the thing is V definitely definitely I don't think there's any argument that V could have stopped him and wanted him to shoot him.

535
00:37:49,289 --> 00:37:52,084
Scott: Oh, yeah He definitely wanted him to wanted to get shot.

536
00:37:52,124 --> 00:37:53,110
Scott: He knew it was gonna happen.

537
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:56,986
Scott: He like if you read it, it feels like V is expecting this guy to show up.

538
00:37:57,006 --> 00:37:57,669
Scott: He's like there you are.

539
00:37:58,252 --> 00:37:58,836
Scott: I was waiting for you.

540
00:37:59,198 --> 00:37:59,279
Rym: Now.

541
00:37:59,299 --> 00:38:03,054
Rym: What I liked is I see two very real Effects of this.

542
00:38:03,074 --> 00:38:03,596
Rym: is that one?

543
00:38:03,616 --> 00:38:06,770
Rym: the guy who shoots him is very reliable as far as the government's concerned.

544
00:38:07,753 --> 00:38:14,639
Rym: So when he goes back and reports to his superiors, no hey, I shot the terrorist I shot V they all believe in and they report to the people that V is dead.

545
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:20,023
Rym: and Then when Evie appears in V's outfit and continues what he was doing.

546
00:38:20,504 --> 00:38:22,590
Rym: That's just like the final blow to the government.

547
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:24,399
Scott: Yep, definitely.

548
00:38:24,439 --> 00:38:26,490
Rym: I thought that was very well done.

549
00:38:27,033 --> 00:38:43,209
Scott: It seems like everything that V does is always like Planned and it seems at first like it has this side effect in the government, you know, and the government guys You know are now acting like in a. you know It's like V does something and then the government guys start acting in a different way.

550
00:38:43,851 --> 00:38:50,670
Scott: But really they're totally his like puppets like he's so far above them that he can just you know control everything they're doing.

551
00:38:51,477 --> 00:38:57,122
Scott: and actually he has a Computer link to the fake computer which is revealed towards the end.

552
00:38:57,704 --> 00:39:01,097
Scott: and so he actually is, you know Not only is he controlling all the government guys.

553
00:39:01,137 --> 00:39:10,486
Scott: He's really controlling everything, you know, it's like oh The guy who's actually been running everything for like 20 years is the guy who's against the government.

554
00:39:10,586 --> 00:39:11,970
Scott: It's like kind of weird.

555
00:39:13,371 --> 00:39:16,264
Rym: See it's a lot in a lot of ways and I actually thought this a little bit.

556
00:39:16,284 --> 00:39:24,262
Rym: the movie goes into it a lot more Because the movie just brings this up straight up and it's not mentioned in the comic but the Count of Monte Cristo Edmund Denn and how.

557
00:39:24,323 --> 00:39:26,353
Rym: it's the same type of.

558
00:39:26,474 --> 00:39:39,037
Rym: that's the same type of story in the sense of the guy comes back for revenge and various other things and He plans everything perfectly and everything goes off without a hitch from beginning to end like the whole thing was just Domino's ready to be knocked over.

559
00:39:39,057 --> 00:39:42,490
Scott: Yep, which they have a nice little domino metaphor.

560
00:39:42,892 --> 00:39:44,459
Rym: Yeah in the movie and in the comic.

561
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,732
Scott: Oh the dominoes in the movie were so much cooler Much.

562
00:39:47,792 --> 00:39:53,585
Rym: we'll talk about that, especially when the dominoes come back later in one scene and you go.

563
00:39:53,766 --> 00:40:05,899
Rym: Oh, oh Now one thing I really liked was that they never they in this kind of book where there's a guy with a mask You always expect at the end.

564
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,512
Rym: They rip the guy's mask off and you see who it really was Mm-hmm.

565
00:40:08,733 --> 00:40:11,065
Rym: The fact that they never take these masks off.

566
00:40:11,286 --> 00:40:12,130
Rym: It's just fantastic.

567
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:18,715
Scott: Well, no see here's the thing if you just made a story about a mask guy and you didn't take the mask off and you Said woohoo.

568
00:40:19,037 --> 00:40:19,640
Scott: I'm different.

569
00:40:19,801 --> 00:40:21,510
Scott: We didn't take the mask off in this one.

570
00:40:21,993 --> 00:40:24,850
Scott: Ooh, that's you know, it's like okay you tried to not take the mask off.

571
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:29,090
Scott: The point is is that not taking the mask off actually meant something?

572
00:40:29,278 --> 00:40:32,688
Rym: Yeah In fact, I would submit that it didn't matter at all.

573
00:40:33,352 --> 00:40:41,860
Rym: And the fact that it wasn't taken off and the fact that by the time I got to the end I didn't care that the mask wasn't taken off I didn't care either because there really isn't much to know.

574
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,726
Scott: It's like it's a disfigured face.

575
00:40:43,766 --> 00:40:46,298
Scott: Probably, you know Well, my

576
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:59,510
Rym: my favorite scene of all that is after V's dead He's laying there and Evie's standing over his body and the comic shows her reach over and take the mask off And there's some guy's face there and then it backs up and you realize no that was just her imagining in her head.

577
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:00,273
Rym: She didn't do it yet.

578
00:41:00,815 --> 00:41:02,240
Scott: And then it was not some guy.

579
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:07,256
Scott: the face that she sees is the face of I think Gordon or Yeah, but I'm just.

580
00:41:07,336 --> 00:41:22,176
Rym: I'm just saying very generally it shows a face it shows a face and then it shows it again and it's a different face and Then finally it shows again that she realizes she pulls it off multiple times and keeps seeing different faces Because she hasn't actually pulled it off.

581
00:41:22,779 --> 00:41:25,790
Rym: and she doesn't pull it off and she realizes that it doesn't matter.

582
00:41:26,172 --> 00:41:29,008
Scott: Yep, it really doesn't it doesn't even matter to the reader.

583
00:41:29,068 --> 00:41:34,493
Scott: I mean It's like when I usually see like a Gundam when you watch a Gundam It's the mask guy.

584
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:40,090
Scott: all you want is for the mass to come off because it's a mysterious guy and you want the mystery revealed.

585
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:51,482
Rym: God got him seed did that to the point where at one scene he's got the mask off but his back is turned and he starts to turn around to look at you and then there's like a Conveniently placed thing and you don't see it and it's like ah, ah, don't do that.

586
00:41:52,104 --> 00:41:53,669
Scott: That's because there's something you know.

587
00:41:54,672 --> 00:41:56,941
Scott: The way that those things are designed is to.

588
00:41:57,282 --> 00:41:59,130
Scott: the reader wants to know more.

589
00:41:59,431 --> 00:42:00,594
Scott: They need to know more.

590
00:42:00,996 --> 00:42:07,722
Scott: it is actually important as to who that guy is and what he looks like is Important to the plot in the story here.

591
00:42:08,023 --> 00:42:08,948
Scott: It has nothing to do with it.

592
00:42:09,575 --> 00:42:09,678
Scott: It.

593
00:42:09,739 --> 00:42:16,819
Rym: you know the mask is his face for all intents and purposes and in fact They even go into that in the story itself in a very cool way.

594
00:42:16,839 --> 00:42:28,573
Rym: when detective catches him and they're standing there and he shoots V Over and over and over he shoots him dead and V ignores it and just walks over to him and he says right here Here's the line.

595
00:42:29,055 --> 00:42:30,140
Rym: Did you think you could kill me?

596
00:42:30,341 --> 00:42:32,370
Rym: There's no flesh or blood within this cloak to kill.

597
00:42:32,671 --> 00:42:35,583
Rym: There's only an idea and ideas are bulletproof.

598
00:42:35,945 --> 00:42:40,249
Rym: Yeah, he said that in the movie, too Yep, and then he walks away and then he dies later.

599
00:42:40,651 --> 00:42:45,952
Rym: But his idea lives on because Evie realizes what he was trying to do and assumes his mantle Mm-hmm.

600
00:42:46,594 --> 00:42:51,430
Rym: now one aspect of the comic that I really liked was the kind of political message the very simple.

601
00:42:51,771 --> 00:42:59,830
Rym: I don't remember if this quotes in the book entirely, but it's definitely in the movie, but it was the quote that Governments or people should not be afraid of their governments.

602
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:01,956
Rym: Governments should be afraid of their people.

603
00:43:02,357 --> 00:43:06,090
Scott: Yeah, and I don't think that was actually in the comic, but the comic did have what was it?

604
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:08,175
Scott: Very veachy something.

605
00:43:08,476 --> 00:43:09,520
Rym: Yeah, the five of you quote.

606
00:43:09,761 --> 00:43:10,524
Scott: Yeah the v-quote.

607
00:43:10,985 --> 00:43:19,510
Scott: Yeah one definitely There's this idea that self-determination and self-rule Yeah, that was one line that was in the comic a lot of times.

608
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:22,946
Scott: That was not in the movie at all was do what thou wilt Aleister Crowley.

609
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:23,549
Scott: Yeah, that's it.

610
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:24,635
Scott: I mean it's all about.

611
00:43:24,816 --> 00:43:27,430
Scott: you know you had this fascist government that doesn't let you do anything.

612
00:43:27,831 --> 00:43:39,030
Rym: And he's trying to say do what thou wilt shall be the law of the land blah blah blah Yeah, and he keeps referring to a fairy tale of the land of do whatever you want mm-hmm and various ideas about that.

613
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:41,469
Rym: I mean he goes into a lot of the ideas of what anarchy really is.

614
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:45,657
Rym: Transhumanism plays a very crucial role in this book.

615
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:52,156
Rym: the political ideas of not letting your government control you unwillingly Obviously.

616
00:43:52,216 --> 00:43:53,849
Rym: the fascism is bad idea.

617
00:43:55,372 --> 00:44:00,050
Rym: The fact that unmitigated anarchy is just as bad because it's not actually anarchy, but chaos.

618
00:44:01,411 --> 00:44:01,892
Rym: I've in fact.

619
00:44:01,913 --> 00:44:03,136
Rym: I believe he says exactly that.

620
00:44:03,176 --> 00:44:03,738
Rym: I forget where.

621
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:11,359
Scott: yeah, there was a point at which the people start rioting and going crazy and Evie is like is this the anarchy you wanted.

622
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:13,467
Scott: He's like no this isn't anarchy.

623
00:44:13,507 --> 00:44:16,819
Scott: This is just chaos You know and he's like anarchy.

624
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:18,946
Scott: is the world without government not a world without order?

625
00:44:19,087 --> 00:44:26,468
Rym: yep, and he basically says I did this so that the people would have the chance to either Create a new thing or destroy the last thing they have.

626
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:29,461
Rym: Mm-hmm all right all in all because once again.

627
00:44:29,521 --> 00:44:33,149
Rym: We've talked for a while, and I know it's been a little rambly But once again we could talk forever.

628
00:44:34,391 --> 00:44:35,917
Rym: This is a very good comic.

629
00:44:36,459 --> 00:44:38,065
Rym: if you haven't read the watchmen read it.

630
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:41,055
Rym: if you haven't read V Read it like.

631
00:44:41,536 --> 00:44:46,009
Scott: even if you're not a person who reads comic books like I know some people are.

632
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:46,855
Rym: I mean It's anime day.

633
00:44:46,955 --> 00:44:48,970
Rym: most of you who listen to this day listen for the anime.

634
00:44:49,292 --> 00:44:51,490
Rym: We don't have so many fans who actually like the comic books.

635
00:44:51,851 --> 00:44:55,910
Scott: Yeah, but there's plenty of comic book podcasts that are better than we are anyway.

636
00:44:55,995 --> 00:45:00,120
Scott: Yeah But even if you don't read comic books you should read this.

637
00:45:00,341 --> 00:45:03,228
Rym: don't consider V or watchmen to be comic books.

638
00:45:03,269 --> 00:45:04,456
Rym: consider them to Be literature.

639
00:45:04,699 --> 00:45:10,409
Rym: well they are litters yes I mean, but like consider them that way think of them as something erudite that you will learn a lot from.

640
00:45:11,691 --> 00:45:15,241
Scott: Just like reading a classic novel only two happens to have pictures.

641
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:19,797
Scott: Yeah, it's not for children like some illustrated You know c-spot run book.

642
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:23,332
Rym: I just can't recommend these two comics enough Mm-hmm.

643
00:45:23,794 --> 00:45:29,203
Scott: I mean no matter how crazy this Alan Moore guy is I think we had a news about how crazy It was the other day or at least how crazy he looks.

644
00:45:29,646 --> 00:45:30,330
Scott: Oh, it looks crazy.

645
00:45:31,313 --> 00:45:34,372
Scott: He's got to be a little bit crazy Rasputin.

646
00:45:34,816 --> 00:45:36,530
Scott: anyone who makes good art is always crazy.

647
00:45:39,352 --> 00:45:47,109
Rym: He is the excellentist writer of comic books and actually you won't often hear me say that the movie Representation of a book is good.

648
00:45:47,952 --> 00:45:55,066
Rym: But also, and we'll talk about it tomorrow in fairly great detail probably in more in greater detail because now we'll be able to talk about comparisons between the two.

649
00:45:56,074 --> 00:45:56,839
Rym: Watch the movie.

650
00:45:56,899 --> 00:45:58,669
Rym: the movie in my opinion was very well done.

651
00:45:58,971 --> 00:46:02,710
Rym: Yeah, as well done as it could be to have been released in America.

652
00:46:04,111 --> 00:46:07,042
Scott: It's not a maybe I mean yeah.

653
00:46:07,082 --> 00:46:11,098
Rym: the movie softened some of the edges of the comic But I can see why they did it mm-hmm.

654
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:14,172
Scott: I can see why it's just a lot of the wise You know.

655
00:46:14,473 --> 00:46:15,296
Scott: yeah, whatever.

656
00:46:15,577 --> 00:46:23,208
Rym: yeah, the one thing is that that fate computer subplot is completely missing from the movie Which I'm fine with because I thought it was kind of dumb to begin with.

657
00:46:23,288 --> 00:46:32,323
Scott: I guess The one thing I could definitely say the movie is worth watching and is definitely at least good in the book of Scott But I don't know if it's worth the 650.

658
00:46:32,323 --> 00:46:34,031
Rym: Oh, it's definitely worth seeing in the theater I think.

659
00:46:34,272 --> 00:46:39,230
Rym: keep in mind that in addition to this being just I mean the book and the movie are very good and very deep.

660
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:44,689
Rym: However in the movie I mean in both of them There are various scenes where V is just killing people with knives.

661
00:46:45,332 --> 00:46:48,702
Rym: I like that in the movie, but it's done by the matrix guys.

662
00:46:49,043 --> 00:46:54,204
Rym: Yep the the knife fighting scenes are Very good knife fighting scenes.

663
00:46:54,506 --> 00:47:00,330
Rym: Oh, yeah They're probably some of the best knife fighting scenes that have been in a movie in a long time.

664
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:02,264
Scott: I say if you for the knife fighting scenes alone.

665
00:47:02,305 --> 00:47:04,314
Scott: I would pay $2.

666
00:47:04,314 --> 00:47:06,470
Rym: Alright, we're almost at the 650.

667
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:07,646
Scott: Yeah, almost there.

668
00:47:08,612 --> 00:47:09,636
Rym: Anyway, we're out.
