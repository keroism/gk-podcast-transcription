00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,017
Rym: It's Thursday March 22nd.

2
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:13,081
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,301 --> 00:00:15,870
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:17,930
Rym: Cthulhu photography.

5
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:24,012
Scott: Let's do this All right, so last Friday.

6
00:00:24,052 --> 00:00:24,899
Scott: We had a little problem.

7
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:28,150
Scott: We were out of bread, and we didn't have any.

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,735
Scott: there was run out of juice.

9
00:00:30,056 --> 00:00:31,320
Scott: We didn't have much to eat for dinner.

10
00:00:32,164 --> 00:00:40,800
Rym: well other than the infinite litany of Frozen meat and frozen vegetables and bits of food that lasts forever that we'd bought a long time ago.

11
00:00:41,302 --> 00:00:45,418
Rym: And the apocalypse never came the zombie apocalypse, so we never used it.

12
00:00:45,819 --> 00:01:09,295
Scott: Yeah Well what happened was is there was huge snow fuck fuck and we didn't want to go anywhere and the grocery store here sucks Anyway, so we didn't mind not going to it and as a result we haven't been to the grocery store in a longer time than usual and We've had to eat the stuff that we had around the house all week Instead of going to get more stuff to eat as we usually do.

13
00:01:09,476 --> 00:01:18,480
Rym: I found frozen meats And I wasn't sure what they were but when I thought them they were tasty I Bought a loaf of bread on the way home from the city and then French toasted it to eat.

14
00:01:18,903 --> 00:01:20,840
Rym: God we ate a lot of French toast that night.

15
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:21,764
Scott: We did cuz.

16
00:01:21,804 --> 00:01:28,330
Scott: I just cuz the thing with French toast is you know you make the little egg stuff And you put the bread in it And then you put the bread in a pan until it's edible.

17
00:01:28,552 --> 00:01:30,660
Rym: now when I make French toast the next step There's no pain.

18
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:38,002
Rym: I usually just eat the French toast immediately as I make it until I'm full and then I continue making French toast until I'm out Of egg.

19
00:01:38,585 --> 00:01:42,404
Scott: yeah, well I just kept making French toast And I couldn't stop.

20
00:01:42,464 --> 00:01:50,820
Scott: cuz once you get going you just keep French toast in and French toast and until you as long as you Have bread and egg you can just keep going forever, so I made way too much for two people.

21
00:01:51,565 --> 00:01:52,995
Scott: I think I hate like five slices.

22
00:01:53,015 --> 00:01:53,660
Scott: It was out of control.

23
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:58,184
Rym: Yeah I guess we got too used to have an Emily around and making a bunch of food or having Alex over and making a bunch of food.

24
00:01:58,204 --> 00:02:02,209
Scott: yeah, and today I ate the One of the last two frozen pizzas.

25
00:02:02,771 --> 00:02:04,197
Rym: I ate like a pound of rice.

26
00:02:04,237 --> 00:02:04,980
Rym: That was my dinner.

27
00:02:05,121 --> 00:02:07,694
Rym: I just filled the rice cooker up, and then I ate all the rice in it.

28
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:08,840
Scott: That's a pretty bad dinner.

29
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:11,815
Rym: It's a pretty good dinner was jasmine rice with some sesame oil.

30
00:02:12,156 --> 00:02:12,920
Scott: What do you say tomorrow?

31
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,769
Scott: We like go out to eat somewhere for awesome.

32
00:02:15,031 --> 00:02:16,780
Rym: Wow that'll hold it off even one more day.

33
00:02:17,522 --> 00:02:19,689
Rym: I know right we might have to go tomorrow anyway.

34
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:22,217
Rym: We got people coming over for D&D of all things.

35
00:02:22,478 --> 00:02:25,399
Rym: no great Yeah, which means now that our house is clean.

36
00:02:26,103 --> 00:02:31,748
Rym: Every bit of the house is clean everything's nice and tidy and all the fridges empty Relatively and all the snacks are cleaned up.

37
00:02:31,768 --> 00:02:34,519
Scott: the freezers real more empty than it's been since we moved in.

38
00:02:35,182 --> 00:02:36,568
Rym: Then the visigoths are gonna come.

39
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:39,060
Rym: they're gonna eat all the food that's left like rats.

40
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:42,272
Rym: Then they're gonna dirty up every single dish in the house.

41
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:44,460
Rym: I don't know how they manage it well.

42
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:51,980
Scott: That's all well and good, but Saturday at 10 a.m.. I'm finally going to get rid of those goddamn game pro magazines.

43
00:02:52,403 --> 00:02:55,784
Rym: Oh the ones you wanted to sell on eBay, but we're too lazy so you try to give away.

44
00:02:55,945 --> 00:03:02,440
Scott: the only reason I didn't sell them on eBay is because Think about I've got basically almost every game pro magazine.

45
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,527
Scott: I think there's a couple missing.

46
00:03:03,547 --> 00:03:04,373
Scott: who knows what happened to him?

47
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:04,856
Scott: who cares?

48
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:09,023
Scott: from 1995 through 2005?

49
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:17,655
Scott: that's like 10 years of magazines 120 magazines some thick something But the pages are very thin paper, and they weigh a lot.

50
00:03:17,695 --> 00:03:19,200
Scott: You know one magazine doesn't weigh much.

51
00:03:19,561 --> 00:03:24,200
Rym: I remember when you had him stacked up and the ones on the bottom had kind of compressed into thinner entities.

52
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,380
Rym: They were barely magazine.

53
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,229
Scott: They're very very heavy when combined.

54
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:35,760
Scott: so even if I sold them on eBay the shipping cost Would it be like hundreds of dollars more than the magazines are worth?

55
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:46,865
Scott: I don't imagine that anyone would want to pay that and It would be also very difficult for me to calculate it and a miscalculation could result in actually losing money Instead of gaining money.

56
00:03:46,925 --> 00:03:51,200
Rym: well in that case you just back out of the eBay deal and take your negative feedback and not care.

57
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:57,900
Scott: Yeah, I'm actually thinking about selling things that aren't a hundred pounds honey Bay though, so it's not the greatest idea.

58
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,872
Scott: Or maybe I'll sell them on some other options.

59
00:03:59,892 --> 00:04:01,039
Rym: I just make another account.

60
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:03,326
Scott: Yeah, it's tied to your credit card.

61
00:04:03,346 --> 00:04:04,611
Scott: They know whatever.

62
00:04:04,651 --> 00:04:06,578
Rym: I have multiple credit cards whatever.

63
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:07,020
Scott: anyway.

64
00:04:07,766 --> 00:04:08,956
Scott: The point is is that I was.

65
00:04:09,097 --> 00:04:18,492
Scott: I decided I'll just give them away to someone who lives around here on Craigslist and a lot of people said they wanted him But no one had the balls to actually come and get him.

66
00:04:18,894 --> 00:04:22,266
Scott: so I finally found a guy And he's gonna meet me at the post-off.

67
00:04:22,287 --> 00:04:25,477
Rym: You're behind the post office where the parking lot is.

68
00:04:25,497 --> 00:04:27,567
Rym: yeah Yeah, I just have a vision.

69
00:04:27,808 --> 00:04:30,020
Rym: at like 2 in the morning Scott's gonna meet this shady.

70
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,683
Scott: I can read him.

71
00:04:30,743 --> 00:04:31,627
Scott: at 10 a.m..

72
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:34,760
Rym: Behind the post office where I have he's gonna get sodomized.

73
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,100
Scott: Yeah, I had to go to the post office anyway by an easy like figure.

74
00:04:39,502 --> 00:04:40,908
Scott: I had to bite as well.

75
00:04:40,928 --> 00:04:41,632
Rym: some game pro.

76
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:43,400
Scott: Give this guy these game pros.

77
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,587
Rym: He's smart cuz.

78
00:04:44,628 --> 00:04:46,459
Rym: he saw that Scott's giving away game pro.

79
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:48,768
Rym: So he's obviously some sort of nerd or geek.

80
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:52,040
Rym: so you won't be able to fight back from the vicious sodomy that awaits.

81
00:04:53,163 --> 00:04:54,575
Scott: So we know Rym psychology is.

82
00:04:56,961 --> 00:05:02,980
Scott: But yeah this guy, I think he's an art teacher nearby, so he will probably give these to kids which will be awesome.

83
00:05:03,141 --> 00:05:04,088
Rym: This is actually kind of cool.

84
00:05:04,128 --> 00:05:05,819
Rym: now you want to hear my crazy scheme.

85
00:05:06,462 --> 00:05:07,105
Rym: Get him.

86
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,054
Rym: just get make up a receipt.

87
00:05:09,315 --> 00:05:10,440
Rym: don't know any numbers on it.

88
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:10,841
Rym: Just have it.

89
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:16,740
Rym: basically say the number of magazines and what they are uh-huh and get him to sign it.

90
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,990
Rym: Especially if he's an educator is gonna use it in the school.

91
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,155
Rym: doesn't hurt him to sign it.

92
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:28,380
Rym: now You can through various means as say the value of said game pros, and it is now a charitable deduction.

93
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:29,345
Scott: Here's the problem.

94
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:30,912
Scott: I just did my taxes.

95
00:05:30,952 --> 00:05:31,414
Scott: I'm gonna.

96
00:05:31,475 --> 00:05:32,379
Rym: This is for next year.

97
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,186
Scott: Scott I know I know I'm not talking.

98
00:05:34,206 --> 00:05:34,989
Scott: I'm not done yet.

99
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:44,109
Scott: I I just did my taxes just now right and You know I'm gonna get a nice return because I gave the government too much goddamn money Which I'm not gonna make that mistake again.

100
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:45,880
Rym: I still haven't done my taxes yet.

101
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:50,839
Scott: I refilled my w-2 when I got the new job, so there's no way I'm giving the government too much money this year.

102
00:05:51,361 --> 00:05:59,860
Scott: Regardless I tried to you know actually itemize all my deductions and everything And it never adds up to more than the default deduct.

103
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,300
Rym: Um you do realize that charitable things can be put in separately depending on how you fill it out.

104
00:06:06,164 --> 00:06:07,140
Scott: Well, I filled it out.

105
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:12,389
Scott: I just went along and I filled everything out and I included my $20 for child's play and it didn't do anything for me.

106
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:21,638
Rym: that well what you realize that all charity does is For every dollar you give to charity it removes that dollar that you gave to charity from your tax burden.

107
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:24,290
Scott: Yep I know that it didn't help though.

108
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:25,475
Rym: Well cuz you only donated $20.

109
00:06:25,475 --> 00:06:29,260
Scott: well Duh cuz I never donate enough for it to do anything.

110
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,251
Rym: So how many game pros do you think are in that pile of game pros?

111
00:06:32,653 --> 00:06:34,419
Scott: over 100 easily all right over 100 now?

112
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,168
Rym: What is the?

113
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,248
Rym: retail value?

114
00:06:37,268 --> 00:06:45,272
Rym: if you had bought them new Game Pro on average I had a subscription Which is what would they cost if it wasn't a subscription?

115
00:06:45,293 --> 00:06:46,398
Rym: if you're buying them in the store?

116
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:49,589
Scott: well I don't have the whole parts of the magazines like.

117
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:52,419
Scott: I tore a lot of shit off of them and why why?

118
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:57,440
Scott: Well you know they used to have like ads attached to them and some of them had CDs in them that are gone.

119
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,257
Scott: And uh a lot of them had like.

120
00:06:59,378 --> 00:06:59,600
Rym: alright.

121
00:06:59,861 --> 00:07:06,108
Rym: So anyway you take the add the value and then maybe make deductions for wear and tear But then increases for value over time and all.

122
00:07:06,128 --> 00:07:07,553
Scott: there's no value over time.

123
00:07:07,854 --> 00:07:08,436
Rym: there might be.

124
00:07:08,456 --> 00:07:09,560
Rym: it's a shitty-ass man.

125
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:15,600
Scott: Even you can buy game pro number one on eBay for like 10 bucks alright, so then take all those adjusted values.

126
00:07:16,883 --> 00:07:21,091
Scott: So they're worth the paper They're printed on but less because they're already printed on.

127
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,580
Rym: and what you do is you deduct it.

128
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,340
Rym: You could probably get five or six hundred dollars all told if you played it right and you documented it properly.

129
00:07:29,721 --> 00:07:30,022
Scott: How about?

130
00:07:30,062 --> 00:07:32,008
Scott: no because that's BS?

131
00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:34,897
Rym: I'm the one who gets the gigantic tax return every year though.

132
00:07:34,977 --> 00:07:35,920
Scott: actually that's bad.

133
00:07:36,001 --> 00:07:36,968
Scott: You don't want a tax return.

134
00:07:36,988 --> 00:07:38,379
Scott: that means you gave the government too much.

135
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:41,200
Rym: no No, I get the jet again a tax return because I pay the right amount.

136
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,449
Rym: But then I do something weird with my taxes.

137
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,260
Scott: why gonna laugh one day when the IRS comes looking for you?

138
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,909
Rym: Well the thing is they were all legitimate.

139
00:07:47,929 --> 00:07:51,466
Rym: the problem is this year's the first year I don't have anything.

140
00:07:51,747 --> 00:07:59,146
Rym: I donated 50 bucks to the RIT anime club And I donated some money But not much money to the local.

141
00:07:59,427 --> 00:08:02,115
Rym: let poor people have electricity fund and that's it.

142
00:08:02,556 --> 00:08:03,940
Rym: I don't have any moving expenses.

143
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,611
Rym: I don't have any special tuition stuff to deduct because remember I paid tuition.

144
00:08:07,651 --> 00:08:14,271
Scott: Oh, yeah, I always I can always detect my awesome Student loan interest payments, oh I could deduct that but it's nothing.

145
00:08:14,371 --> 00:08:15,494
Scott: that's my biggest deduction.

146
00:08:15,555 --> 00:08:17,099
Scott: is the the student loan interest.

147
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:18,303
Scott: really Yeah, I paid like.

148
00:08:19,026 --> 00:08:21,134
Scott: I paid like thousands of dollars in student loan interest.

149
00:08:21,154 --> 00:08:27,766
Rym: this what I paid like 300 bucks total and that included that crazy 12% loan that I got rid of.

150
00:08:27,786 --> 00:08:31,036
Scott: I paid a lot of student loan interest according to the piece of paper I got.

151
00:08:31,056 --> 00:08:33,967
Rym: Wow I Didn't realize you had that much student debt.

152
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:34,972
Scott: I don't know.

153
00:08:35,072 --> 00:08:36,197
Scott: That's just what the number said.

154
00:08:36,217 --> 00:08:41,440
Rym: yeah Well I take care of mine manually so I pay up ahead and I let it all go automatic.

155
00:08:41,581 --> 00:08:41,782
Scott: I don't.

156
00:08:41,842 --> 00:08:43,111
Scott: it'll be paid off eventually.

157
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:44,219
Scott: It's not that bad.

158
00:08:44,612 --> 00:08:49,060
Rym: Yeah Plus what really helped me last year was memory moved to your way back when we moved here.

159
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:49,787
Scott: That was counted.

160
00:08:49,828 --> 00:08:51,080
Scott: everything is moving expenses.

161
00:08:51,341 --> 00:08:56,340
Rym: Well a lot of it was moving expenses like the thousand some dollars we spent on that stupid truck.

162
00:08:57,044 --> 00:08:58,493
Scott: Yeah, that was a moving expense.

163
00:08:58,513 --> 00:08:59,700
Rym: Yeah, especially all the diesel.

164
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,820
Scott: Yeah, I remember when you had to fill that thing up and take a taxi back, and you that was horrible.

165
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,184
Rym: I deducted the taxi though.

166
00:09:06,887 --> 00:09:07,990
Rym: That was a moving expense.

167
00:09:08,211 --> 00:09:08,752
Scott: good job.

168
00:09:09,254 --> 00:09:09,956
Rym: Actually it was.

169
00:09:09,976 --> 00:09:13,600
Rym: I followed all the rules I didn't have to do anything shady, and I still have the receipts.

170
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,928
Rym: Okay You I got that file cabinet there.

171
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:19,073
Rym: I keep track of all that stuff.

172
00:09:19,093 --> 00:09:20,760
Rym: That's why I keep paperwork around.

173
00:09:20,981 --> 00:09:24,360
Scott: I keep paperwork around, but only the absolutely every piece of paper.

174
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:24,642
Scott: I say.

175
00:09:24,662 --> 00:09:26,214
Scott: will I ever look at this piece of paper again?

176
00:09:26,234 --> 00:09:27,462
Scott: if the answer is yes I keep it.

177
00:09:27,482 --> 00:09:32,360
Rym: well you realize that you're suppose you have to keep X years of all your tax documents.

178
00:09:32,922 --> 00:09:34,587
Scott: I keep all tax documents for sure?

179
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:35,912
Rym: yeah, well those are tax documents.

180
00:09:35,932 --> 00:09:37,838
Rym: They're the receipts that back up the deductions.

181
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:40,767
Rym: I made uh That's the only reason I keep them.

182
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:41,611
Scott: I don't keep.

183
00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:43,520
Rym: I'm gonna throw them away in two more years.

184
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:45,288
Scott: Yeah, taking standard deduction.

185
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:47,759
Scott: You know I don't really have to keep so many receipts around.

186
00:09:47,819 --> 00:09:50,328
Rym: god I file a manual 1040 a every year.

187
00:09:50,349 --> 00:09:51,854
Scott: I use turbo tax.

188
00:09:51,934 --> 00:09:52,376
Scott: It's easy.

189
00:09:53,038 --> 00:09:55,494
Rym: actually one year I had to file a 1040 because the a wouldn't cut it.

190
00:09:55,937 --> 00:10:01,240
Scott: actually though This was the first year where I made so much money that I couldn't do it for free.

191
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,835
Scott: I had to actually give turbo tax money instead of not giving them any money.

192
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,040
Scott: Just using their website for free.

193
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:10,436
Rym: Yeah, yeah, I think you're also above the line where you can't use the easy form anymore.

194
00:10:10,596 --> 00:10:12,667
Scott: No no easy form Just a normal whatever.

195
00:10:12,707 --> 00:10:14,299
Rym: I never actually got to use the easy form.

196
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:18,174
Scott: I've used the easy form almost every year did I?

197
00:10:18,194 --> 00:10:21,291
Scott: I don't think I used it last year But I definitely I never could.

198
00:10:21,593 --> 00:10:23,082
Rym: when I was in college I had to do.

199
00:10:23,163 --> 00:10:26,820
Rym: I spent a bunch of bonds to pay for stuff and the bonds had weird business.

200
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,257
Rym: So I had to use a 1040 a. then the next year I had a bunch of other weird business.

201
00:10:30,418 --> 00:10:33,474
Rym: then the next year I made too much money, and then from that point on I made too much.

202
00:10:33,535 --> 00:10:34,400
Rym: I never got to use one.

203
00:10:34,781 --> 00:10:35,344
Scott: They're awesome.

204
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:36,791
Scott: It takes like five minutes.

205
00:10:36,992 --> 00:10:39,182
Scott: Yeah, you just say how much money Did you make?

206
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:39,824
Scott: do you?

207
00:10:40,025 --> 00:10:41,471
Scott: are you allowed to use the easy form?

208
00:10:41,912 --> 00:10:43,799
Scott: if the answer is yes do this man?

209
00:10:45,181 --> 00:10:56,240
Rym: Wait a minute, but I thought according to the Internet's that you don't have to pay the income tax because technically Ohio wasn't a state when they voted for the Federal Reserve and the IRS and all that business.

210
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:57,732
Scott: All right you try that.

211
00:10:57,792 --> 00:10:58,760
Scott: yeah, see what happens.

212
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:03,828
Rym: I just remember my dad knew a guy who tried that all the time, and he always said yeah You don't have to pay tax pay taxes.

213
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,919
Rym: dude went to jail one day, and I was the end of him.

214
00:11:07,044 --> 00:11:07,454
Scott: They do.

215
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:14,940
Rym: Anyway in the news the American Postal Service has decided in the United States Postal Service.

216
00:11:15,382 --> 00:11:18,935
Rym: Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna say I'm gonna be all ethnocentric and say American here.

217
00:11:19,437 --> 00:11:20,020
Scott: Oh that good.

218
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:26,200
Rym: Yeah We don't have so many listeners in South America compared to the rest of except for the listeners in South America who are going.

219
00:11:26,421 --> 00:11:28,731
Rym: Yeah, you know what if you're in South America.

220
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:29,213
Rym: Let us know.

221
00:11:29,233 --> 00:11:30,137
Rym: That'd be cool.

222
00:11:30,297 --> 00:11:30,880
Scott: There was a guy.

223
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,229
Scott: He does let us know constantly.

224
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:34,625
Rym: I know are there any more Areas?

225
00:11:34,685 --> 00:11:36,739
Scott: probably I've seen some preppers.

226
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:47,254
Rym: Anyway the United States Postal Service the USPTO Has decided to raise the price of stamps see in America every few years.

227
00:11:47,294 --> 00:11:49,660
Rym: for generally semi-random reasons.

228
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,371
Rym: They decide to raise the price of stamps, and they'll raise.

229
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,720
Scott: um USPTO is the patented trademark?

230
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,864
Rym: Yeah, it is anyway.

231
00:11:55,964 --> 00:11:56,888
Scott: It's the USPS.

232
00:11:56,928 --> 00:11:57,148
Rym: Yes.

233
00:11:57,349 --> 00:12:04,940
Rym: They raised the price of stamps like three cents And then they sell three cent stamps, so you don't have to waste all your old stamps.

234
00:12:05,522 --> 00:12:11,808
Rym: Yep, even though I'd be fine if they just raised it to 50 cents ten years ago, and just left it there So it was easier.

235
00:12:11,869 --> 00:12:12,840
Rym: I don't send that much mail.

236
00:12:13,282 --> 00:12:16,013
Scott: Yeah, not only do I not send that much mail, but think about it.

237
00:12:16,214 --> 00:12:22,575
Scott: even if stamps were 50 cents 75 cents even if they were a dollar right what can I get for a dollar?

238
00:12:22,635 --> 00:12:23,638
Scott: I can get a bagel.

239
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:26,029
Scott: I can Get not a bagel with cream cheese.

240
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:26,953
Rym: Just a bagel.

241
00:12:26,993 --> 00:12:29,304
Scott: I can get a bagel with butter for a dollar Yeah, but not cream.

242
00:12:29,385 --> 00:12:31,734
Scott: I can get a couple packs of gum.

243
00:12:32,036 --> 00:12:32,980
Rym: Yeah crappy gum.

244
00:12:33,524 --> 00:12:34,088
Scott: Oh good gum.

245
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,358
Scott: you can get some double mint for a dollar.

246
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:36,644
Rym: Yeah, not so much.

247
00:12:36,684 --> 00:12:36,986
Rym: double me.

248
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:41,183
Rym: you can get a lot of fruit by the foot for a dollar plenty packs are like a little Over a dollar.

249
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:45,140
Rym: so get a lot of bubble tape for a dollar plenty pack with a few sticks missing.

250
00:12:45,842 --> 00:12:46,162
Scott: You know.

251
00:12:46,523 --> 00:12:47,345
Scott: now think about this.

252
00:12:48,007 --> 00:12:58,755
Scott: the Postal Service for one first-class stamp will take a piece of paper and perhaps some other things and Transport them to anywhere else in the United States very quickly.

253
00:12:58,775 --> 00:13:00,120
Scott: You don't even have to bring it to them.

254
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,380
Scott: They'll take it out of your house, and then bring it to someone else's house right to the door.

255
00:13:06,141 --> 00:13:11,520
Scott: That's worth a dollar and they're only charging what 30 something cents now, and they're gonna charge 40 something cents.

256
00:13:11,647 --> 00:13:13,109
Scott: Yeah It's still a steal.

257
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,460
Scott: what the hell are you complaining about?

258
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:20,419
Scott: The only people who lose from this are people who send lots of mail and the only people send lots of mail are junk mailers.

259
00:13:20,961 --> 00:13:27,139
Rym: Yep now the best part is they've added this thing called the forever stamp, which you can buy for I believe the 41 cent.

260
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,494
Rym: Yep, 41 cents, but unlike normal stamps.

261
00:13:30,514 --> 00:13:31,740
Rym: They don't have an amount on them.

262
00:13:32,121 --> 00:13:34,591
Rym: They are worth one first-class postage.

263
00:13:34,993 --> 00:13:36,640
Rym: No matter what forever.

264
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:38,149
Scott: Oh, that's a good idea.

265
00:13:38,169 --> 00:13:39,779
Scott: You can buy a whole bunch of them.

266
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,064
Rym: Yeah, I'm gonna.

267
00:13:41,426 --> 00:13:47,879
Rym: they don't sell them on sheets because they don't want people who send a lot of junk mail out But don't send enough junk mail to use the junk mail rate to use them.

268
00:13:48,181 --> 00:13:50,671
Rym: They're just gonna sell them in small quantities to normal people.

269
00:13:50,691 --> 00:13:51,895
Scott: Yeah, I'll go buy it.

270
00:13:51,935 --> 00:13:53,100
Scott: Can you get him like in a roll?

271
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,099
Rym: Yeah, you just can't get him in the crazy gigantic sheets.

272
00:13:56,412 --> 00:13:59,533
Scott: Yeah I'd go and get a roll of them and then I'd never need freaking stamps again.

273
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:04,260
Scott: cuz that's something as I always tend to buy Stamps like as I need them like I have to mail a bunch of stuff.

274
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:16,035
Scott: I just bought stamps for the first time in like six months like when I need to mail one letter I buy one stamp and what I need to mail like a few letters I buy one book of stamps, and I always know don't have stamps.

275
00:14:16,076 --> 00:14:18,366
Scott: the next time I need them Let's see this time.

276
00:14:18,406 --> 00:14:19,672
Scott: I'm gonna go to the post office.

277
00:14:19,753 --> 00:14:21,120
Scott: I'm gonna buy a bunch of them.

278
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,592
Rym: I send about seven letters a year.

279
00:14:24,612 --> 00:14:25,917
Scott: I don't send too many.

280
00:14:25,937 --> 00:14:26,640
Scott: I send the rent.

281
00:14:27,222 --> 00:14:27,964
Rym: Oh, yeah the rent.

282
00:14:27,984 --> 00:14:31,555
Rym: so I send like 12 and I send electric bill.

283
00:14:31,595 --> 00:14:31,896
Rym: I do.

284
00:14:32,056 --> 00:14:33,140
Scott: Yep, not much.

285
00:14:33,802 --> 00:14:35,508
Scott: I pay most of every bill online.

286
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:39,100
Rym: So yeah, so I don't have much more to say about that.

287
00:14:39,201 --> 00:14:40,059
Rym: I just thought I'd bring it up.

288
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,145
Rym: I thought it was interesting.

289
00:14:41,446 --> 00:14:43,254
Rym: the internet lost its shit over this.

290
00:14:43,334 --> 00:14:50,378
Rym: as they lose their shit over everything People are gonna forget and then the rate change will happen and people will grumble and then they'll forget and then it won't matter.

291
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:54,933
Scott: Yep Anyway, there's been a lot of RIAA news is lately.

292
00:14:55,013 --> 00:14:56,960

Scott: Leave us alone.

300
00:15:18,571 --> 00:15:19,554
Scott: You're wasting our time.

301
00:15:19,976 --> 00:15:21,260
Rym: more power to them.

306
00:15:51,512 --> 00:15:53,380
Rym: It's almost like we planned this almost.

307
00:15:53,982 --> 00:15:58,334
Scott: I mean CD sales have been going down quite a bit over the past few years.

308

Scott: Yeah.

309
00:15:58,635 --> 00:16:04,151
Rym: No, this is a huge Drop, isn't it interesting that I mean aren't?

310
00:16:04,191 --> 00:16:06,920
Rym: don't the numbers show that online music sales are going up?

311
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:14,784
Scott: Yeah, but online music sales, you know compared to the times in say the 90s We were CD stuff.

312
00:16:14,824 --> 00:16:15,948
Scott: sales were crazy.

313
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:23,192
Scott: Even if you add the online sales and the real sales together It's not even close to what the sales used to be.

314
00:16:23,574 --> 00:16:27,909
Rym: now people might say yeah Piracy is the reason CD sales are down like they always say.

315
00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:35,512
Rym: but I point out that way way back in the day When you know, there was no Napster there weren't even mp3s.

316
00:16:35,753 --> 00:16:38,140
Rym: You couldn't easily pirate music at all.

317
00:16:39,021 --> 00:16:46,339
Rym: Even then I thought that 15 bucks for a CD was a total ripoff and I bought maybe four CDs Over the course of I don't know seven years.

318
00:16:47,182 --> 00:16:54,280
Scott: Yeah, I think the real reason that CD sales are going down is you know way back when recorded music started selling a whole lot.

319
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,765
Scott: You had people like Elvis.

320
00:16:55,906 --> 00:16:57,612
Scott: It was just so big what you know.

321
00:16:57,732 --> 00:16:59,880
Scott: few artists that were just so incredibly huge.

322
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,419
Scott: Yeah, the Beatles they were just so huge, you know, the Rolling Stones are so huge.

323
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:07,537
Scott: And then the 90s you had a lot of you know pop stars that were so huge.

324
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:13,387
Scott: now There aren't really huge pop stars Music stars so much anymore.

325
00:17:13,406 --> 00:17:17,440
Scott: If you look at like the Grammys they tend to be people who are famous a long time ago.

326
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,339
Scott: Where are the new famous musicians that are super popular everywhere, huh?

327
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:32,552
Rym: Maybe it's more of a balkanization where people in local areas like local bands or people all over the world like one little band and then another set of people all over like one

328
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:41,608
Scott: other little or because people finally have access to Lots of different genres of music instead of just pop and rock The they can find the genre that they like.

329
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:47,659
Scott: that was never in the store on the internets and they don't need the record companies That sell vanilla music anymore.

330
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:54,420
Rym: Also the fact that there is a lot of actually free not illegal music all over the internet and a lot of it's really good.

331
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,034
Scott: Yeah, if anything hurt record sales more, you know, it wasn't Napster.

332
00:17:58,054 --> 00:17:59,138
Scott: It was ocremix.org.

333
00:18:01,442 --> 00:18:02,666
Scott: But yeah, they're down 20%.

334
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:05,576
Scott: now, let me give you an idea of how big I hit.

335
00:18:05,636 --> 00:18:06,600
Scott: this is right.

336
00:18:07,882 --> 00:18:09,690
Scott: There was a CD recently the.

337
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:16,072
Scott: it was a movie soundtrack to some movie I've never heard of called dream girls, right it hit number one.

338
00:18:16,092 --> 00:18:17,577
Scott: It was the number one CD.

339
00:18:18,058 --> 00:18:19,425
Scott: it sold 60,000 CDs in a week.

340
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:24,488
Scott: Aha in 2005 it wouldn't have been in the top 30, huh?

341
00:18:24,508 --> 00:18:26,014
Scott: But in 2007, it's number one.

342
00:18:28,602 --> 00:18:48,420
Rym: I wonder if this sudden drop has a lot to do with the industry and what music is available or if maybe all this Time I was geeks been bitching about the RIAA has started to leak into the masses now that the RIAA is being Well, probably the biggest set of jackasses in the world at this point outside of actual jackasses like North Korea and Iran.

343
00:18:48,521 --> 00:18:49,587
Rym: But I digress.

344
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:50,050
Scott: Yeah.

345
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,660
Scott: Well, there's an anecdotal evidence.

346
00:18:52,303 --> 00:18:56,380
Scott: I recently read some guy who is a super music CD collecting guy, you know.

347
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,847
Scott: He's the kind of guy who bought everything.

348
00:18:57,867 --> 00:19:05,180
Scott: he had a zillion vinyls and then he bought a zillion CDs and he goes to all sorts of record shops everywhere and loves buying CDs as tons of them.

349
00:19:05,841 --> 00:19:16,259
Scott: He recently started buying some iTunes and it you know, of course the DRM got in his way big time got in his way Basically, he paid for music and then he couldn't play it.

350
00:19:16,661 --> 00:19:21,675
Scott: So he wrote this big rant about how he super pissed and now he doesn't buy music so much anymore.

351
00:19:21,695 --> 00:19:22,257
Scott: Nah.

352
00:19:22,979 --> 00:19:27,600
Rym: Oh Way to kill probably one of the biggest sources of your income people like that.

353
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:30,239
Rym: Yep, I mean DVDs.

354
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:39,777
Rym: I get the impression that the primary buyers of DVDs in America are Hoarders and collectors and people who have this whatever need they feel like.

355
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:45,180
Rym: yeah I gotta own all these DVDs and they want to have this giant rack of DVDs next to their hi-fi system.

356
00:19:45,341 --> 00:19:52,720
Scott: I see a lot of people, you know I've been to their houses and they've got like all their favorite movies on DVD like just crap tons of them big racks.

357
00:19:53,141 --> 00:19:56,270
Rym: I have all my favorite movies at my disposal any time.

358
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,313
Rym: I want through Netflix.

359
00:19:57,835 --> 00:19:58,918
Scott: Yeah orbit torrents.

360
00:19:59,158 --> 00:20:02,524
Scott: Yes Hey, I buy DVDs but not many.

361
00:20:02,745 --> 00:20:10,171
Rym: they have to be either really cheap or they have to be something that I plan on watching a lot or Showing to other people or lending to other people.

362
00:20:10,372 --> 00:20:11,859
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty much what it's got to be.

363
00:20:12,463 --> 00:20:15,180
Rym: I mean when I bought Firefly, it's not like I needed to buy it.

364
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,580
Rym: I know like 10 people I could have borrowed it from and I'd seen most of it already.

365
00:20:19,022 --> 00:20:22,359
Rym: I bought Firefly mostly to lend to yet more people.

366
00:20:23,063 --> 00:20:24,490
Scott: Yeah, I mean and think about this though.

367
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,560
Scott: If you buy a CD, what are you gonna do with it?

368
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:32,080
Scott: You rip the mp3s and so throw the CD away and then if you don't lend it to people you give it to people here.

369
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:32,984
Scott: Here's the mp3s.

370
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:33,626
Scott: go have fun.

371
00:20:33,647 --> 00:20:36,459
Scott: Yeah, so what's the point of paying for the CD?

372
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,498
Scott: I mean, it's kind of silly not like buying a DVD where there's actually sort of a point to buying it.

373
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,382
Rym: now There's still.

374
00:20:42,402 --> 00:20:47,400
Rym: I guess the only the fun thing is that I don't even pirate any RIA music anymore either.

375
00:20:47,561 --> 00:20:50,557
Rym: Well part of that's that I've already got all the old good music.

376
00:20:50,638 --> 00:20:50,980
Rym: I like.

377
00:20:51,181 --> 00:20:55,966
Scott: Yeah, all this all the music from like the 70s the 80s in the 90s That was actually good that I like.

378
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,252
Scott: or you know 60s and 50s.

379
00:20:57,312 --> 00:20:59,300
Scott: Also, I've got it all already.

380
00:20:59,521 --> 00:21:04,900
Scott: I got it a long time ago and I sort of rightfully own it because some of it I bought on CD for real.

381
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,551
Rym: Oh, I don't rightfully own any of it some of it.

382
00:21:07,591 --> 00:21:11,126
Scott: I rightfully own but not much, you know, but There you go.

383
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:12,171
Scott: What else?

384
00:21:12,232 --> 00:21:13,156
Scott: there's no new music.

385
00:21:13,216 --> 00:21:13,900
Scott: I want from them.

386
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:23,674
Rym: well all the new music I like is either indie stuff or already free stuff or foreign stuff where While it may technically be illegal to pirate Japanese CDs.

387
00:21:24,015 --> 00:21:27,067
Rym: I'm not going to pay $30 for a CD.

388
00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:33,911
Scott: No, I'm not going to pay 30 or 40 dollars for a CD Especially when they make it incredibly difficult for me to buy it.

389
00:21:33,931 --> 00:21:34,454
Scott: Of course.

390
00:21:34,474 --> 00:21:36,946
Rym: Well, it's not that you're in New York City It's pretty easy to buy it.

391
00:21:37,027 --> 00:21:41,852
Scott: actually I got yeah, but I got to go find it I don't know, you know how to look for it in a Japanese store.

392
00:21:41,872 --> 00:21:44,739
Rym: you go in and you ask and they point at it Yeah, it's no good.

393
00:21:45,323 --> 00:21:58,220
Rym: My issue is more with the fact that well, maybe not my issue But there is an interesting argument that it may not Technically be illegal to pirate foreign media simply in certain circumstances.

394
00:21:59,703 --> 00:22:00,266
Scott: I don't know.

395
00:22:00,307 --> 00:22:02,300
Scott: Well, it's whether it is or whether it isn't.

396
00:22:02,481 --> 00:22:03,525
Scott: I don't think it should be.

397
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:06,979
Scott: if something is not available in the place where you live

398
00:22:07,502 --> 00:22:10,359
Rym: But you said it is you can order it on the internet for a lot of money

399
00:22:10,801 --> 00:22:17,869
Scott: But it's not a bit like if some if it is if there's a movie and it's only available on region 3 DVD and you live in region 1.

400
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:23,119
Scott: I See no reason that you shouldn't just be allowed to just take it if they don't want to sell it to you.

401
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,808
Scott: But see you can take it without harming anyone.

402
00:22:26,189 --> 00:22:29,500
Rym: but CDs aren't region and they are available.

403
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,346
Rym: You can buy any Japanese CD online.

404
00:22:31,948 --> 00:22:34,917
Rym: Yeah, it just cost a lot of money from a company in Japan.

405
00:22:34,957 --> 00:22:35,720
Scott: That's far away.

406
00:22:35,941 --> 00:22:38,093
Rym: Yeah, yeah, you're just rationalizing.

407
00:22:38,114 --> 00:22:39,099
Rym: at least I come out with it.

408
00:22:40,222 --> 00:22:40,604
Scott: It's not.

409
00:22:41,046 --> 00:22:43,580
Scott: it's not licensed for distribution in your country.

410
00:22:44,103 --> 00:22:50,740
Scott: So so it's legally not available in your country Even though someone over there will sell it to you and send it to you.

411
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:54,130
Rym: But you know, I like my rationalization a lot more whatever.

412
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,574
Scott: It's it's cool.

413
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:57,540
Scott: So the RA is sucking even more.

414
00:22:58,581 --> 00:23:00,126
Scott: I predict what do they got?

415
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:01,470
Scott: How many years do you think they got left?

416
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:04,880
Scott: if they're at 60,000 CDs now for number one hit?

417
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,889
Scott: Right, uh at 60,000 CDs a week and you go 20% in a year.

418
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:14,520
Scott: So next year It'll be what 40,000 something CDs in a week.

419
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:23,380
Rym: well, it really depends on a lot of factors and rates and that sort of thing because the Hardcore inner circle of CD buyers might hold out to the bitter end or something.

420
00:23:23,842 --> 00:23:33,119
Scott: I give it three years until we see this actually Harming their business in a very in a such a way that they go Oh shits and they have to fire people and all sorts of stuff.

421
00:23:33,682 --> 00:23:40,500
Rym: I'll bet that within five years the organization known as the RIAA Well, I'll make it seven years will not exist as it does today.

422
00:23:40,942 --> 00:23:41,908
Scott: I think what's gonna happen.

423
00:23:41,948 --> 00:23:43,699
Scott: Is that other media companies?

424
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:49,620
Scott: That are gonna start just buying the old record companies taking all their stuff and doing better things with all that stuff?

425
00:23:50,021 --> 00:23:51,026
Scott: I think that's what's gonna happen.

426
00:23:51,428 --> 00:24:02,435
Scott: all the new media companies like Google and Google are Gonna buy all the record companies And do something better with the music.

427
00:24:02,737 --> 00:24:09,420
Rym: Wow You know I just imagine if a philanthropist just bought because those these companies don't make that much money anymore.

428
00:24:09,942 --> 00:24:14,436
Rym: What if a philanthropist just bought one of these record companies and just public domain everything?

429
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:15,520
Scott: they would be awesome.

430
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:16,897
Scott: That's what I would do if I could afford it.

431
00:24:17,305 --> 00:24:27,135
Rym: Yeah Maybe we should put together a fund to make a little shell company from pure donations nonprofit And all it does is buy intellectual property and then public domain.

432
00:24:27,155 --> 00:24:29,947
Scott: it sounds good But how do we decide what to buy first?

433
00:24:30,228 --> 00:24:32,779
Scott: start with the cheapest the low-hanging fruit or go for the big ones.

434
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:34,048
Rym: first We could set up some sort.

435
00:24:34,109 --> 00:24:37,629
Scott: if you get too many low-hanging fruits You might not be able to get a big thing that actually matters.

436
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:40,000
Rym: you set up some sort of moderation system where people who?

437
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,527
Rym: contribute can vote based on how much money they put in.

438
00:24:42,988 --> 00:24:47,684
Rym: or maybe we just get people to donate and then I Personally decide.

439
00:24:48,045 --> 00:24:58,095
Scott: I think what we should do is we put up a list of things that we want to buy and how and then You can put your money towards a specific thing Especially if it was a pledge system as opposed to a give us money now system.

440
00:24:58,115 --> 00:25:03,078
Rym: because give us money now is Actually rimspeak for total scam to steal your money.

441
00:25:04,122 --> 00:25:05,028
Scott: It sounds good to me.

442
00:25:05,068 --> 00:25:05,692
Scott: Let's do both.

443
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:08,120
Rym: Yeah But no we did a pledge system.

444
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,760
Rym: Then there's no way we're scamming because we don't get the money unless we actually have enough to do it.

445
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:18,069
Rym: It's like you have to pledge and if we get the ten grand we need or whatever amount of money it is Then you got to give us the money.

446
00:25:18,593 --> 00:25:19,680
Scott: No you give us a credit card.

447
00:25:19,781 --> 00:25:21,598
Scott: We just don't charge it until the time come.

448
00:25:21,638 --> 00:25:22,442
Rym: yeah Something like that.

449
00:25:23,084 --> 00:25:35,759
Rym: or we gather every geek on the Internet's credit card, and we spend the rest of our lives in Fiji things of the day.

450
00:25:36,325 --> 00:25:41,070
Rym: Now this may be a total cop-out But I was actually surprised by how funny this was.

451
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:48,110
Rym: you know all those compilation things people put on YouTube like yeah Oh the funniest moments of the creepy pedophile from Family Guy.

452
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:51,380
Rym: or Oh Homer Simpson's best top 10 funny bits.

453
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,772
Scott: Yeah, someone goes and you know they takes their Simpsons DVD collection.

454
00:25:54,812 --> 00:25:59,232
Scott: They cut out all the Ralph Wiggum's they paste them together They put it on YouTube, and they hope that you know.

455
00:25:59,252 --> 00:26:08,672
Scott: then they make their blog link to it And then they put some Google ads on their blog and then they dig their own blog with the route You know and then they try to get some money from the Google ads.

456
00:26:08,793 --> 00:26:09,737
Scott: people do this all the time.

457
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:16,780
Rym: luckily Dig video is kind of prevented that from happening because now all the links go right to the video.

458
00:26:17,304 --> 00:26:18,373
Scott: Yep, it's good stuff.

459
00:26:18,736 --> 00:26:25,120
Rym: Yeah every now And then they go to one of those crap non YouTube video sites though some of them are okay like College Humor is alright.

460
00:26:25,241 --> 00:26:27,111
Rym: Oh College Humor is the only one that isn't crap cuz.

461
00:26:27,151 --> 00:26:28,880
Rym: College Humor has its own good content.

462
00:26:28,981 --> 00:26:36,755
Scott: Yeah, the meta cafe isn't so bad if you have proper ad blockages But it's still not as good as YouTube or I shouldn't need to add block that much.

463
00:26:36,916 --> 00:26:44,220
Rym: I know I know Granite It's no underdogs even though people in our forums seem to have had trouble downloading xcom from last night.

464
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:44,604
Scott: That's fine.

465
00:26:44,624 --> 00:26:48,255
Scott: Let's download star control 2 instead Which is much easier to get.

466
00:26:48,537 --> 00:26:48,900
Rym: but anyway?

467
00:26:49,000 --> 00:27:00,187
Rym: I saw this one that claimed to be the funniest moments of Homer Simpson and while it is not probably all Of the funniest moments of Homer Simpson it is a laugh-out-loud Confilation of some of Homer's better moments.

468
00:27:00,668 --> 00:27:03,416
Scott: It is quite a good Homer compilation video.

469
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:08,099
Rym: I must say it starts with one I'd never seen with the spider, which was probably one of the funniest one.

470
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:13,060
Scott: Well, I think that one got me going because it reminded me of one of my favorite penny arcade comics.

471
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,280
Scott: We're at the hobo spy the hobo spy engage hobo spy.

472
00:27:17,562 --> 00:27:21,099
Rym: I'm confident that this box contains engages contain cell phones.

473
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:29,033
Rym: Anyway, this is actually Surprisingly worth watching and I'll leave it at that.

474
00:27:29,475 --> 00:27:29,696
Scott: Yep.

475
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:38,569
Scott: All right I had a bunch of things of the day to choose from and I decided to go with this one because I was a random decision completely arbitrary.

476
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:39,271
Scott: So this is what you get.

477
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:43,795
Scott: So there was some sort of sand castle Competition of some sort.

478
00:27:43,876 --> 00:27:52,400
Scott: I don't know I don't really care either But people made awesome sand castles the kind of sand castles that you can't possibly make unless you're a sand castle master.

479
00:27:52,581 --> 00:27:53,786
Rym: I'm surprised you didn't say it.

480
00:27:54,147 --> 00:27:54,790
Rym: Wait for it.

481
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,637
Rym: You can't make ten sack assholes.

482
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:05,782
Rym: Oh I was reminded of our inside joke when Dave and Joel who apparently discovered the video much later than I started making Reference to it.

483
00:28:05,802 --> 00:28:08,009
Scott: That's kind of weird because it started out back.

484
00:28:08,049 --> 00:28:09,072
Scott: I remember months ago.

485
00:28:09,493 --> 00:28:17,529
Scott: Everyone was like, yeah Dave and Joel That's that podcast that small time but hilarious and all the other Podcasts is steal their jokes from it.

486
00:28:17,589 --> 00:28:19,198
Scott: And now Dave and Joel stealing jokes from us.

487
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:23,635
Scott: Haha, yeah, we stole from some kids in Brooklyn who are on YouTube.

488
00:28:23,976 --> 00:28:25,120
Rym: we should find those kids.

489
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:28,555
Scott: We should find those kids and we could interview them for a whole episode interview.

490
00:28:28,575 --> 00:28:32,437
Scott: I just want to hang out with them That's but we don't know enough about Pokemon to hang out with them.

491
00:28:34,001 --> 00:28:35,447
Rym: We'll play some Pokemon puzzle league.

492
00:28:35,829 --> 00:28:36,130
Scott: Yes.

493
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:41,533
Scott: Anyway, saying castles that are too awesome You can't possibly make them and what do you do with the same castle?

494
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:47,400
Scott: when you're done making it that it's so awesome You blow it up surround castle to stay alive.

495
00:28:48,003 --> 00:28:51,580
Scott: Now what if you take a video of the sand castle blowing up that's pretty damn cool.

496
00:28:51,741 --> 00:28:54,460
Rym: Yeah, now you can watch it over and over again in slow motion.

497
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:58,192
Rym: You can watch sand castles blow up that you were never physically near.

498
00:28:58,774 --> 00:29:00,820
Scott: What if you play that video backwards?

499
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,659
Rym: That's probably pretty cool to watch.

500
00:29:03,881 --> 00:29:13,200
Scott: It's really freaking cool because you basically see sand Everywhere a bunch of tiny flecks of sand and they come together as if by match to make a sand castle.

501
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:16,695
Rym: You know, you're actually seeing how a wizard would make a sand castle.

502
00:29:17,137 --> 00:29:21,116
Scott: that's pretty much Yeah, what it would look like if a wizard made a sand castle with his magic powers.

503
00:29:21,437 --> 00:29:21,940
Scott: It's pretty cool.

504
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,506
Scott: I say you should watch it and go.

505
00:29:23,526 --> 00:29:26,839
Scott: Ooh, and then in five minutes later, you'll never need to watch it again.

506
00:29:27,542 --> 00:29:33,980
Rym: So that is not dead which can eternal lie and with strange eons even death may die.

507
00:29:34,241 --> 00:29:36,085
Scott: Why do you have to be all like?

508
00:29:36,105 --> 00:29:41,359
Rym: because that is probably one of the most famous quotes from horror fiction ever short only of?

509
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,372
Rym: Cthulhu photography.

510
00:29:44,118 --> 00:29:51,609
Rym: Yeah See tonight geek culture seems to have been suffused by Cthulhu.

511
00:29:51,629 --> 00:29:53,963
Rym: Cthulhu is Ubiquitous.

512
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:54,926
Rym: it is everywhere.

513
00:29:55,307 --> 00:29:57,394
Rym: any geek has at least heard of Cthulhu.

514
00:29:57,414 --> 00:29:59,320
Rym: They know it's that green guy with the tentacles.

515
00:29:59,581 --> 00:30:04,020
Rym: There's Cthulhu plushies Cthulhu's in like every webcomic at least once or twice.

516
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:08,254
Rym: Cthulhu is an inside joke to every geek social group out there.

517
00:30:08,294 --> 00:30:16,340
Scott: just about I mean, I didn't even know Anything about Cthulhu or anything until I got to college, but once I did it sorta exploded.

518
00:30:16,963 --> 00:30:20,420
Rym: Yeah, I mean even despite this everyone knows about Cthulhu.

519
00:30:20,783 --> 00:30:21,854
Rym: They see him all the time.

520
00:30:22,318 --> 00:30:33,320
Rym: yet I've noticed over the years that very few geeks relatively have Actually read any of the literature from which kook through Lou derives.

521
00:30:33,862 --> 00:30:36,030
Scott: It'd be like if everyone was a fan of Darth Vader.

522
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,516
Scott: You saw Darth Vader everywhere.

523
00:30:37,556 --> 00:30:38,580
Scott: You saw lightsabers.

524
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,985
Scott: You dressed up as Darth Vader.

525
00:30:40,206 --> 00:30:44,220
Scott: You made jokes about where the ambassadors are and choking.

526
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:51,096
Scott: You know admirals and things but you never saw Empire Strikes Back or Star Wars or return of the Jedi.

527
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:51,920
Scott: you just never saw them.

528
00:30:52,322 --> 00:30:54,614
Scott: But you loved Darth Vader and you talked about him all the time.

529
00:30:54,695 --> 00:30:55,399
Scott: That's what it's like.

530
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,331
Scott: Yeah, people are talking about Cthulhu never read.

531
00:30:58,391 --> 00:30:59,315
Scott: call a Cthulhu.

532
00:30:59,777 --> 00:31:02,899
Scott: It's not even a book It's a short story and you can get it online for free.

533
00:31:03,181 --> 00:31:04,064
Scott: Yeah, what the hell.

534
00:31:04,606 --> 00:31:21,547
Rym: and despite I mean even with all this there's a lot of things In geek culture and video games out there that derive heavily from the Cthulhu mythos or the Cthulhu stories eternal darkness for the GameCube is so Lovecraftian that well obviously

535
00:31:21,587 --> 00:31:27,908
Scott: the people making that wanted to make a Cthulhu game and couldn't get the Cthulhu license So they just made a game that was so close instead.

536
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:29,794
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty obvious.

537
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:31,720
Rym: There was also the call of Cthulhu game.

538
00:31:32,342 --> 00:31:36,037
Scott: Yeah, I don't think any of the actual Cthulhu license games were any good as far as I heard.

539
00:31:36,057 --> 00:31:36,800
Rym: that's what I've heard.

540
00:31:37,242 --> 00:31:41,782
Rym: I don't actually know but in case you couldn't tell we're not actually talking about Cthulhu.

541
00:31:41,802 --> 00:31:48,443
Rym: Cthulhu is in fact a minor part of a greater body of works written by a man named HP Lovecraft.

542
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:52,136
Rym: don't worry about what is actual, you know what the H&P stand for.

543
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:53,440
Rym: it's kind of like JRR Tolkien.

544
00:31:53,901 --> 00:31:56,409
Rym: Everyone knows him as HP Lovecraft and that's all that matters.

545
00:31:56,670 --> 00:32:00,180
Rym: I'm not gonna go into his biography even though Howard Phillips Lovecraft.

546
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:06,800
Rym: Yeah Yeah Even though his life is actually pretty interesting his father went insane and died in an asylum.

547
00:32:07,101 --> 00:32:10,700
Rym: His mother went insane and died in an asylum.

548
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,568
Scott: That makes a lot of sense.

549
00:32:12,909 --> 00:32:15,580
Rym: He was a nerdly angry little man.

550
00:32:16,021 --> 00:32:21,980
Rym: He had a lot of friends through correspondence because he lived mostly as a hermit and and he was a super anglophile.

551
00:32:22,382 --> 00:32:25,299
Rym: There's a lot of evidence that he was a super anti-semite.

552
00:32:26,702 --> 00:32:31,200
Rym: All keeps making sense all sorts of interesting stuff, but I'm not gonna get into that.

553
00:32:31,661 --> 00:32:36,300
Rym: But when I was a young child, my mother was very much into horror fiction.

554
00:32:36,841 --> 00:32:40,773
Rym: She read Stephen King and I think Dean Cook is never get all those.

555
00:32:41,094 --> 00:32:45,449
Scott: my mom also liked the horror type stuff You know like the Anne Rises and the Stephen Kings.

556
00:32:46,111 --> 00:32:48,925
Scott: and right I know but it's not hard It's not.

557
00:32:49,047 --> 00:32:51,785
Scott: but as a kid I didn't like horror stuff.

558
00:32:51,825 --> 00:33:01,880
Scott: cuz I was scared and then for some I don't know how I went for being scared of like Anything that was the slightest bit scary like the boogity man to not being scared of pretty much anything.

559
00:33:02,322 --> 00:33:05,760
Rym: When I was really really young I was afraid of the dark and I was afraid of skeletons.

560
00:33:06,647 --> 00:33:08,080
Scott: Oh, I was never afraid of skeletons.

561
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,808
Rym: I was when I was a little kid.

562
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:19,868
Rym: if you would put me next to a dead body That was freshly killed with like knives in it or put me next to a cleanly Like a skeleton a bleached white skeleton.

563
00:33:20,129 --> 00:33:21,695
Rym: The skeleton would have disturbed me more.

564
00:33:21,795 --> 00:33:22,718
Rym: I don't know why.

565
00:33:22,739 --> 00:33:24,390
Rym: now I think skeletons are awesome.

566
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:27,577
Rym: skills are the best Skellingtons are today.

567
00:33:27,658 --> 00:33:31,548
Scott: I love Well, not the anorexic guide.

568
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:32,771
Rym: I was very much.

569
00:33:33,152 --> 00:33:41,320
Rym: I liked horror stories and I had a lot of Children's horror story books and I read a bunch of Stephen King when I was really really probably too young.

570
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,672
Rym: I remember reading skeleton crew when I was a little kid.

571
00:33:43,752 --> 00:33:45,079
Scott: I didn't even read goosebumps.

572
00:33:45,845 --> 00:33:47,558
Rym: I read all the goosebumps and I found them trite.

573
00:33:47,863 --> 00:33:49,372
Scott: Yeah I didn't read any.

574
00:33:49,412 --> 00:33:50,079
Scott: my brother read him.

575
00:33:50,401 --> 00:33:55,136
Rym: But still like a lot of this stuff was really kind of scary and I would talk about it a lot.

576
00:33:55,437 --> 00:34:01,900
Rym: and one day my mother Basically said I think you're old enough to read real horror and I said what that wasn't horror.

577
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,344
Rym: I've been reading all the Stephen King.

578
00:34:03,384 --> 00:34:04,306
Rym: that's scary, right.

579
00:34:04,687 --> 00:34:13,000
Rym: and she hands me tales of horror and the macabre a collection of HP Lovecraft's works followed by tales of terror and death.

580
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:23,331
Rym: It's a scary stuff right there and I was introduced to this world of horror fiction That is so different from all of the other horror fiction out there.

581
00:34:23,351 --> 00:34:24,996
Rym: That is almost its own genre.

582
00:34:25,536 --> 00:34:26,400
Scott: I don't know about that.

583
00:34:26,581 --> 00:34:29,031
Scott: It's just you know, you read a horror story, right?

584
00:34:29,051 --> 00:34:29,391
Scott: And what it?

585
00:34:29,453 --> 00:34:29,612
Scott: what?

586
00:34:29,694 --> 00:34:31,120
Scott: what's the typical horror story?

587
00:34:31,724 --> 00:34:33,900
Scott: Oh, there's someone who's in a tough situation.

588
00:34:34,061 --> 00:34:35,308
Scott: So the suspense of are they?

589
00:34:35,348 --> 00:34:36,253
Scott: you know, they're gonna get hurt.

590
00:34:36,293 --> 00:34:37,460
Scott: the monsters after them the wall.

591
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:43,007
Scott: He's calling from the phone upstairs The Dracula or the Frankenstein or whatever it is coming.

592
00:34:43,108 --> 00:34:47,520
Rym: put the money on the collection plate and the finger bone stuck to his hand.

593
00:34:48,561 --> 00:34:49,563
Scott: Yeah something, you know.

594
00:34:49,665 --> 00:34:51,029
Scott: and crazy stuff happens.

595
00:34:51,069 --> 00:34:58,968
Scott: and it's always about the crazy thing that hey vampires Zombie comes out of the ground and goes boo Rice is not horror.

596
00:34:58,988 --> 00:35:01,760
Scott: Something is so gross that you're gonna bargo, right?

597
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:10,355
Scott: Yeah and it's all about what actually Really happens or what you think is going to happen in the possible near future.

598
00:35:10,436 --> 00:35:18,636
Scott: because the current situation is all HP Lovecraft, he doesn't really tell you so much right out what happens.

599
00:35:18,676 --> 00:35:22,915
Scott: It's always about the Unspeakable and the unnamables and the.

600
00:35:23,337 --> 00:35:25,266
Scott: you know He kind of it's.

601
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:28,739
Scott: it's weird and that he doesn't lay it out on the table for you.

602
00:35:29,301 --> 00:35:35,680
Scott: But in the same way you get the idea in your head or close enough that you don't go insane and die.

603
00:35:36,322 --> 00:35:37,406
Rym: Yes, I mean the.

604
00:35:38,108 --> 00:35:41,520
Rym: the stories that HP Lovecraft work are wrote are very varied.

605
00:35:41,781 --> 00:35:45,000
Rym: They're not like this long story arc of a mythos.

606
00:35:45,241 --> 00:35:48,720
Rym: They're not this collection of stories that all piece together into something big.

607
00:35:49,141 --> 00:35:52,131
Rym: there are a lot of generally disconnected stories.

608
00:35:52,171 --> 00:36:02,120
Rym: that kind of reference each other or give Nods to other works and that sort of thing and you can really take each one pretty much independently and it's still a good story.

609
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:07,400
Rym: There's no reason to try to find all the connections between this world that HP Lovecraft was making.

610
00:36:07,943 --> 00:36:10,939
Rym: It's not about his stories as in terms of what they are.

611
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:17,620
Rym: It's more about the way he wrote his stories and the themes he used and the way he would describe events.

612
00:36:18,102 --> 00:36:21,295
Rym: That was it's not you know, oh my god boo scary.

613
00:36:21,315 --> 00:36:34,960
Rym: It's a lot more of this unnerving disturbing kind of you of horror where as Opposed to say a zombie story where the zombies are chasing the guy or at the end the zombie grabs his leg and oh my god.

614
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:48,659
Rym: There are a lot of stories HP Lovecraft wrote where there is some sort of monster some sort of horrible beyond time and space beyond life and death Being and it's coming after someone but he'll never actually describe it.

615
00:36:49,182 --> 00:36:52,519
Rym: In fact, it won't even show up until the end and even then it doesn't really show up.

616
00:36:52,881 --> 00:37:05,419
Rym: The story is mostly the person thinking about how afraid of it He is or trying to deal with it or trying to get away Despite the fact that the character himself hasn't even seen it let alone as HP Lovecraft describing it to you.

617
00:37:06,001 --> 00:37:17,440
Scott: Yeah, a lot of the stories seem to follow a you know a similar pattern especially Call of Cthulhu where there's a guy and Something maybe slightly strange happens or maybe nothing strange happens at all.

618
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:29,071
Scott: But you know someone discovers something and they want to know more about it like a book or an item or something and they start researching or investigating or they get involved in something and they learn more and more.

619
00:37:29,532 --> 00:37:31,819
Scott: and the more they learn the more they can't stop learning.

620
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:40,079
Scott: but at the same time the more they wish they never started in the first place and Eventually they get to the end of the road and it's just worse on from here on out.

621
00:37:40,642 --> 00:37:44,074
Rym: I don't think anything HP Lovecraft ever wrote has.

622
00:37:44,154 --> 00:37:45,860
Rym: I wouldn't even bother with a happy ending.

623
00:37:46,442 --> 00:37:49,876
Rym: I don't think he even has melancholy endings pretty much.

624
00:37:50,137 --> 00:37:50,980
Rym: Everyone's fucked.

625
00:37:51,596 --> 00:37:54,029
Scott: Yeah I mean the whole world of HP Lovecraft.

626
00:37:54,109 --> 00:38:02,460
Scott: every single story is pretty much saying a Similar thing in one way or another in that you are just a useless nothing.

627
00:38:02,882 --> 00:38:04,089
Scott: You're your human being.

628
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:05,860
Scott: your life is worthless and meaningless.

629
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:20,959
Scott: They're crazy things out beyond the stars and also on earth that are way more important than you and you are totally Insignificant if you try to even learn a little bit about the things that are significant in the universe You'll probably just go insane and die.

630
00:38:21,622 --> 00:38:22,727
Scott: It's the only kid.

631
00:38:22,807 --> 00:38:28,180
Scott: pretty much your choices are stay in the shitter that you're in or Try to get out and end up in a worse shitter.

632
00:38:28,553 --> 00:38:36,907
Rym: Yes the general overriding theme of most of HP Lovecraft works revolve around this idea that The true nature of reality.

633
00:38:37,268 --> 00:39:00,370
Rym: What's actually going on is so utterly alien and horrifying that mankind does not have the physical capacity to deal with it to understand it or to even Grasp it for a moment and that the world and earth and everything were at one time under the domain of Horrible eldritch beings from beyond the stars and beyond death.

634
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:04,120
Rym: and that the world is this thing far greater than we could ever understand.

635
00:39:04,641 --> 00:39:10,879
Rym: but now the stars aren't right and all those beings and all those things are asleep or waiting or hiding.

636
00:39:10,899 --> 00:39:36,147
Rym: and for this tiny microsecond of history mankind has evolved and comes to exist on earth totally oblivious to the true reality of the world and the idea that the worst thing that could ever happen to a person is if they put together all the If humans figure it out.

637
00:39:36,388 --> 00:39:42,068
Rym: if humans put the puzzle together and step back and actually see The end result of everything they have discovered.

638
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:45,560
Rym: it is so horrible that death is not even an escape.

639
00:39:46,322 --> 00:39:48,910
Rym: Yeah, I mean this is heavy horror here.

640
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:50,576
Rym: This is not light reading.

641
00:39:51,178 --> 00:39:51,920
Scott: No, it is not.

642
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:56,239
Scott: It's actually sometimes if you don't read it carefully hard to figure out what exactly is going on.

643
00:39:56,319 --> 00:39:58,948
Rym: Yes Well, he writes in a very archaic style.

644
00:39:58,988 --> 00:40:00,593
Rym: He was definitely an angle.

645
00:40:00,693 --> 00:40:02,218
Scott: I mean this stuff is from like the 20s.

646
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:06,109
Rym: Well, not only that his writing was archaic for the 20s.

647
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:09,640
Rym: He uses a lot of old interesting words.

648
00:40:09,921 --> 00:40:13,993
Rym: He describes things in very strange ways in a lot of ways.

649
00:40:14,114 --> 00:40:15,317
Scott: It's the writing itself.

650
00:40:15,418 --> 00:40:16,160
Scott: That is scary.

651
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:22,640
Scott: It's like you have all these old words that he uses all the time and it doesn't matter what the words are saying.

652
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:24,354
Scott: The words themselves are frightening.

653
00:40:24,697 --> 00:40:29,894
Rym: eldritch Cyclopean horrors claw at my squamous flesh.

654
00:40:30,134 --> 00:40:30,395
Scott: Yes.

655
00:40:30,496 --> 00:40:34,719
Scott: Kwame's is is the famous That we like to remember quite often.

656
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:42,308
Rym: I don't know I like the word eldritch even though I use that in D&D long before I knew about Cthulhu and all that squamous is my favorite one.

657
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:44,014
Scott: It's like oh squamous.

658
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:48,170
Scott: It just yeah, you know You don't want to run into anything that squam is pretty much ever.

659
00:40:48,672 --> 00:40:48,752
Rym: now.

660
00:40:48,792 --> 00:40:55,033
Rym: the interesting thing about These writings is that the way he presents the works and the way they're written.

661
00:40:55,514 --> 00:41:01,372
Rym: if you don't say you don't know anything about Hp Lovecraft or the mythos or you don't even know that it's fiction.

662
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:11,803
Rym: You just have this literature and you start reading it You'll get the sense that it's based on something you always feel like there's some maybe not truth to it Not like.

663
00:41:12,045 --> 00:41:27,320
Rym: well, it's actually based on the ancient writings of the blah blah But it really reads like it's based on some real mythology somewhere or it's based on some actual Tablets that we found long ago or some old culture even though it's entirely fabricated.

664
00:41:27,681 --> 00:41:29,286
Rym: In fact, there are a lot of feet like.

665
00:41:29,466 --> 00:41:31,051
Rym: the Necronomicon is a good example.

666
00:41:31,412 --> 00:41:33,980
Rym: The Necronomicon was invented by Hp Lovecraft.

667
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:35,410
Scott: Well, it's not really.

668
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:36,800
Scott: I don't think he wrote the Necronomicon.

669
00:41:36,981 --> 00:41:40,174
Rym: No, no, but he made up the idea of the Necronomicon.

670
00:41:40,194 --> 00:41:40,435
Rym: Yes.

671
00:41:40,536 --> 00:41:42,582
Rym: He called it the Necronomicon.

672
00:41:42,642 --> 00:41:44,129
Scott: yeah in many of his stories.

673
00:41:44,229 --> 00:41:46,700
Scott: He refers to a book called the Necronomicon.

674
00:41:47,122 --> 00:41:50,595
Rym: It is a a grimoire of the most horrible knowledge.

675
00:41:50,916 --> 00:41:51,820
Scott: It's a grimoire.

676
00:41:52,141 --> 00:41:55,334
Rym: Whatever captain didn't read much Hp Lovecraft at all.

677
00:41:55,495 --> 00:41:56,238
Scott: I read enough.

678
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:06,659
Scott: Yeah Yeah, I've read like a whole bunch of books on my shelf over there, and I've read most of them All right for the ones I brought recently, but anyway It's a grimoire and it's written by my favorite fictional person ever.

679
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:12,117
Scott: well I guess the fifth best name the mad Arab Abdul al-hazred.

680
00:42:12,137 --> 00:42:19,640
Scott: ha ha That's just awesome to say the mad arab because they always capitalize mad and arab like he's the mad arab.

681
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,826
Rym: Yeah, definite article.

682
00:42:20,867 --> 00:42:36,800
Scott: if you get definite article and mad in your name That's quite a thing yeah, so he wrote this book fictional book written by a fictional guy written in a work of fiction Called the Necronomicon which is the book that has basically all the horrible stuff in it.

683
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,551
Scott: And if you read it you go insane and die and crazy stuff happens.

684
00:42:39,752 --> 00:42:39,893
Rym: now.

685
00:42:39,973 --> 00:42:43,730
Rym: a lot of people over the years have published Necronomicon or acted like it was real.

686
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:50,380
Rym: a lot of people today believe that the Necronomicon was a real book and that they use this mythology and all these horrors.

687
00:42:50,703 --> 00:42:58,176
Scott: If you go to borders or whatever and go to the Durandi bullshit section you can see copies of the Necronomicon there the written by who knows who.

688
00:42:58,296 --> 00:43:04,099
Scott: I'm sure you could find out But it didn't exist when HP Lovecraft was writing about it.

689
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:15,216
Rym: now Not only do his writings really almost lend this sense of legitimacy to them But a lot of people attribute things that they think were written by HP Lovecraft him when in fact they weren't.

690
00:43:15,698 --> 00:43:27,533
Rym: in fact most of The Cthulhu mythos the so-called mythos around this and the outer gods and the elder gods and how they're at war and all the Kind of pieced together stuff wasn't written by HP Lovecraft at all.

691
00:43:27,553 --> 00:43:29,380
Rym: It's written by all his friends long after his death.

692
00:43:29,741 --> 00:43:32,851
Rym: Yeah, or the yellow sign or the king in yellow.

693
00:43:33,213 --> 00:43:38,290
Rym: that was actually written by a man named Robert Chambers Who was also a pretty good writer, but it wasn't HP Lovecraft.

694
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:40,900
Rym: the two were friends, but not the same guy.

695
00:43:41,121 --> 00:43:41,804
Scott: Yeah, Lovecraft.

696
00:43:41,905 --> 00:43:48,489
Scott: You know he wrote some stories that introduced a lot of the Creatures and monsters and horrors that are present in.

697
00:43:48,609 --> 00:43:56,176
Scott: you know games like Call of Cthulhu and the general Cthulhu mythos But he never really you know established like alright.

698
00:43:56,196 --> 00:43:56,316
Scott: Well.

699
00:43:56,356 --> 00:43:57,140
Scott: This is how it works.

700
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,575
Scott: There's elder gods and outer gods and old ones and this and that.

701
00:44:00,615 --> 00:44:01,640
Scott: and you know the other thing.

702
00:44:02,102 --> 00:44:17,735
Scott: He just kind of threw the monsters in there And then it was after he was done that people collected all these things and made them work in the same universe in some sort of Systematic fashion ready for RPGing and further writings and fan fictions,

703
00:44:18,396 --> 00:44:19,820
Rym: so why are these so scary?

704
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:30,700
Rym: we've already talked about the fact that the way it's written and the way everything is described is so just odd and almost realistic that it's bothersome to read it because you feel like you're missing something or that there's something just.

705
00:44:31,762 --> 00:44:36,138
Rym: But there's also this idea that there's really no escape for these characters.

706
00:44:36,158 --> 00:44:38,228
Rym: there are stories I think the thing on the doorstep.

707
00:44:38,248 --> 00:44:47,086
Rym: when I was a kid this scared me more than just about anything I'd ever read because not to really ruin it, but the main character the guy Dies he loses.

708
00:44:47,146 --> 00:44:47,988
Rym: It's over right.

709
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:49,934
Rym: It's that you lose you die.

710
00:44:50,014 --> 00:44:51,960
Rym: That's the end you might have lost, but now you're dead.

711
00:44:52,584 --> 00:44:54,920
Rym: Death was no escape and the story doesn't end.

712
00:44:56,201 --> 00:44:57,143
Rym: Think about that.

713
00:44:57,384 --> 00:45:05,599
Rym: if you were up against something that you don't understand you can't see and yet even if you die You can't get away.

714
00:45:06,125 --> 00:45:07,237
Rym: What what could you do?

715
00:45:08,582 --> 00:45:13,410
Scott: Yeah, I mean you watch a normal horror movie Let's say right in the mod the zombies chasing you right.

716
00:45:13,751 --> 00:45:23,220
Scott: so it's a little bit scary because you have the suspense of trying To get away from the horrible situation, but in the end usually some of the characters probably the main character gets away.

717
00:45:23,641 --> 00:45:24,665
Scott: There's a way that you know.

718
00:45:24,685 --> 00:45:26,070
Scott: they can run away from the zombie.

719
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:27,174
Scott: they can kill the zombie.

720
00:45:27,214 --> 00:45:28,880
Scott: they can they could do something.

721
00:45:29,462 --> 00:45:33,640
Scott: You know one guy might die over there a guy might die over there, but someone's going to escape.

722
00:45:33,821 --> 00:45:39,560
Scott: There's a terrible situation with horrible scary things and someone's gonna live somehow an HP Lovecraft.

723
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:50,289
Scott: I mean the things that in a normal horror story would help you survive such as learning more about the zombies Acquiring weapons and actually trying to fight the zombies of some sort.

724
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:54,680
Scott: those things are only gonna make it worse and not better.

725
00:45:55,162 --> 00:46:04,500
Rym: I mean if you want to take a nod from the Cthulhu based role-playing games The idea is not to win or to figure it out or to kill Cthulhu.

726
00:46:05,063 --> 00:46:23,368
Rym: The idea is pretty much to stave off insanity for as long as possible Assuming full well that any character you play will go insane and or die possibly at the same exact moment a combination in the famous Lovecraftian insane and dead Finishing move.

727
00:46:23,409 --> 00:46:25,468
Scott: I Guess we'll call it.

728
00:46:26,055 --> 00:46:37,617
Rym: Yes So lately we've been reviewing or talking about a lot of things we like and this is also something that will we gush about because HP Lovecraft works are some of my favorite writings I've ever read.

729
00:46:37,637 --> 00:46:40,227
Scott: yeah I mean I like some of them better than others.

730
00:46:40,529 --> 00:46:45,548
Scott: Oh, yeah, but like the dream quest of unknown cadence That's a freaking awesome super awesome.

731
00:46:45,708 --> 00:46:49,200
Rym: I think my favorite work of HP Lovecraft's is the color out of space.

732
00:46:49,822 --> 00:46:50,424
Scott: It's a good one.

733
00:46:50,444 --> 00:46:52,030
Scott: I forget which one it is.

734
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:54,739
Scott: It's the one with Antarctica and the old ones in the Shagat.

735
00:46:55,741 --> 00:46:56,524
Scott: What's that one called?

736
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:56,946
Scott: I forget.

737
00:46:56,966 --> 00:47:01,832
Rym: I actually forget the names of a lot of them because I read him in giant anthologies Just one after another.

738
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:09,423
Scott: yeah It's like you buy since they're all short stories you tend to like buy like these books that have a whole bunch of short stories In them.

739
00:47:10,428 --> 00:47:11,674
Scott: Oh at the mountains of madness.

740
00:47:11,694 --> 00:47:12,418
Scott: That's the one.

741
00:47:12,438 --> 00:47:18,057
Scott: yeah, and You just read a bunch of short stories in a row and you forget which one is which and like.

742
00:47:18,077 --> 00:47:24,879
Scott: you'll remember the name Of a story, but you remember which story that was And some of them are a lot scarier or memorable than others.

743
00:47:26,142 --> 00:47:29,714
Scott: These things are written in pulp magazines and that sort of stuff way back when.

744
00:47:29,854 --> 00:47:31,520
Scott: so it's not like you know.

745
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:34,100
Scott: Everyone was a masterpiece kind of deal.

746
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:39,400
Rym: Yeah In general if you want to get an idea of what these works are like I'd recommend the color out of space.

747
00:47:40,102 --> 00:47:41,768
Rym: The shadow out of time is really good.

748
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:48,556
Rym: The thing on the doorstep is pretty creepy I must say and that might be one of the scarier ones.

749
00:47:48,696 --> 00:47:56,233
Rym: as a little kid I mean it was pretty scary all the way through but then at the end I Actually stopped reading HP Lovecraft for a while after that.

750
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:58,100
Rym: that was a little too much for my young mind.

751
00:47:59,461 --> 00:48:06,100
Rym: Herbert West reanimator and of course the call of Cthulhu which I wouldn't recommend reading first.

752
00:48:06,702 --> 00:48:14,672
Rym: But I recommend reading it because it's probably the most well-known work And it has probably my well another one of my favorite quotes from.

753
00:48:14,732 --> 00:48:20,112
Rym: I have to read this quote because it's just it too Perfectly sums up just about everything that Lovecraft wrote about.

754
00:48:20,132 --> 00:48:25,913
Rym: the most merciful thing in the world I think is the inability of the human mind to correlate all of its contents.

755
00:48:26,455 --> 00:48:39,040
Rym: someday the piecing together of Disassociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality and our frightful position They're in that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.

756
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:43,737
Scott: All right, if we're gonna keep doing this reading game, I want to read something here.

757
00:48:43,757 --> 00:48:44,440
Rym: Oh, what are you gonna read?

758
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:49,100
Scott: I'm gonna read the description of the shoggoth, which is my one of the best monsters ready.

759
00:48:49,982 --> 00:48:56,619
Scott: So they hear this is how I'm gonna demonstrate how he describes something without really describing it.

760
00:48:56,659 --> 00:49:05,692
Scott: you ready It was a terrible indescribable thing Vast er than any subway train a shapeless conjure.

761
00:49:05,732 --> 00:49:05,913
Scott: Wow.

762
00:49:05,953 --> 00:49:08,099
Scott: I actually don't know this word c-o-n-g-e-r-i-e.

763
00:49:08,743 --> 00:49:09,196
Scott: conjury.

764
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:10,603
Rym: conjury.

765
00:49:10,927 --> 00:49:29,880
Scott: conjury of Protoplasmic bubbles faintly self-luminous and with myriads of temporary eyes forming and unforming as pustules of greenish light all over the tunnel Filling front that bore down upon us crushing the frantic penguins and Shiltering over the glistening floor for that and its kind had swept so evilly free of all litter.

766
00:49:30,682 --> 00:49:33,248
Rym: Yeah, try to try to draw that.

767
00:49:33,448 --> 00:49:41,768
Scott: Yeah, try to think of what a shoggoth looks like from that considering he uses the words Indescribable shapeless and conjury.

768
00:49:42,009 --> 00:49:45,220
Rym: see another word that you'll really have to be familiar with is non-euclidean.

769
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:50,013
Scott: Yeah, well if you know anything about geometry, you know, there's a guy named Euclid.

770
00:49:50,033 --> 00:49:59,500
Scott: He was Greek right keep going Yeah, and he pretty much invented modern basic geometry and his geometry is a geometry of three dimensions.

771
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:03,874
Rym: Well, I think I think I can sum it up better non-euclidean geometry.

772
00:50:04,315 --> 00:50:08,880
Rym: You can have line You can do things that you can't do in normal geometry.

773
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:16,220
Rym: You can have parallel lines that cross each other or you can have a right triangle that has seven hundred and twenty degrees within it.

774
00:50:16,882 --> 00:50:17,885
Scott: All kinds of crazy.

775
00:50:17,985 --> 00:50:23,100
Rym: imagine things that not only are they did they're not just difficult to describe.

776
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:26,932
Rym: It's not like the person who saw this shoggoth or saw this city of real.

777
00:50:26,952 --> 00:50:29,440
Rym: Yeah, just had trouble describing it.

778
00:50:29,761 --> 00:50:32,772
Rym: It's that he could not fathom what he was seeing.

779
00:50:33,133 --> 00:50:36,988
Rym: that it is something so alien That it cannot be described.

780
00:50:37,028 --> 00:50:38,133
Rym: It cannot be understood.

781
00:50:38,153 --> 00:50:40,000
Scott: Yeah, I mean think about this for a second, right?

782
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:42,892
Scott: You have a triangle one of the three corner.

783
00:50:42,912 --> 00:50:44,780
Scott: The triangle has three corners and three sides.

784
00:50:45,382 --> 00:50:47,287
Scott: one of the corners is 90 degrees.

785
00:50:47,989 --> 00:50:52,569
Scott: if you add up the degrees of all three corners, it is like 700 degrees.

786
00:50:54,042 --> 00:50:55,170
Scott: Think about that for a second.

787
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:56,640
Scott: try to get a picture of that in your brain.

788
00:50:56,941 --> 00:50:57,382
Scott: You can't.

789
00:50:57,684 --> 00:51:02,120
Scott: that's why he can't even use words to tell you what it looks like, but it's scary as hell.

790
00:51:03,201 --> 00:51:09,283
Scott: You don't want to run into that triangle, especially if it's part of a monster that's gonna eat you Man.

791
00:51:09,323 --> 00:51:12,240
Rym: I talked more about the Cthulhu role-playing game, but we should do that on a Tuesday.

792
00:51:12,721 --> 00:51:18,280
Scott: Yeah, the Cthulhu role-playing game is basically role-playing in a universe with all these indescribable things.

793
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,493
Rym: There's also Arkham horror which you've played.

794
00:51:20,553 --> 00:51:21,358
Rym: I have yet to play it.

795
00:51:22,164 --> 00:51:26,666
Scott: Arkham horror is one of those Teamwork beat the game board games.

796
00:51:27,629 --> 00:51:30,778
Scott: I think I like it better than that Lord of the Rings board game, huh?

797
00:51:30,919 --> 00:51:35,096
Scott: But It's it takes a lot more time than it's worth.

798
00:51:35,157 --> 00:51:35,680
Scott: basically.

799
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,451
Scott: Yeah, there's lots of Cthulhu stuff out there.

800
00:51:38,713 --> 00:51:41,683
Scott: If you like you through loose stuff Go for it.

801
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:43,628
Scott: There's more than you can handle.

802
00:51:43,668 --> 00:51:45,032
Rym: Scott's got a stuffed Cthulhu.

803
00:51:45,313 --> 00:51:47,620
Rym: Alex has a Cthulhu finger puppet our friend Greg.

804
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:50,120
Rym: I think he had a shoggoth and a star spawn.

805
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:52,307
Scott: There's a lot of stuff out there.

806
00:51:52,327 --> 00:51:54,799
Scott: I think I got to go get a gnarly thotep one day.

807
00:51:55,081 --> 00:51:56,729
Rym: Gnarly thotep is my man.

808
00:51:56,869 --> 00:51:58,980
Scott: I must say he is the crawling chaos.

809
00:51:59,757 --> 00:52:05,655
Rym: So Event essentially check out HP Lovecraft and all of the related works.

810
00:52:05,836 --> 00:52:08,970
Rym: I think you're really gonna like it Unless you're a wuss.

811
00:52:09,474 --> 00:52:09,635
Rym: now.

812
00:52:09,736 --> 00:52:19,527
Rym: before we go I'd also like to note that the deadline is now as of this podcast over for the worst podcast in the world Contest those naps.

813
00:52:19,708 --> 00:52:27,660
Rym: unless you have what you think is the most awesome entry in the world I'll accept him up until tomorrow at midnight if you think you've got the best freaking entry.

814
00:52:28,142 --> 00:52:30,011
Rym: But I must say there's some stiff competition.

815
00:52:30,071 --> 00:52:35,893
Rym: people have sent us some pretty bad Podcasts that I'm going on quite a bit longer than you might have expected.

816
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:44,650
Scott: Yeah, even before listening I've narrowed this down to like three or four and as soon as I go back and listen to what all the rules were We might have a winner.

817
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:51,680
Rym: I think yeah granted We're going to read many of the entries because I find this hilarious and some people ragged on some pretty popular podcasts.

818
00:52:52,521 --> 00:52:59,299
Scott: Yeah, I was expecting people to find these obscure podcasts made by like one ten-year-old nerd in his closet or something.

819
00:52:59,319 --> 00:53:02,240
Scott: granted some of Them did some of them did but that's what I was expecting.

820
00:53:02,601 --> 00:53:07,577
Scott: Then some people came out and they were like, yeah, this popular podcast is the worst podcast and I'm like.

821
00:53:07,617 --> 00:53:08,400
Scott: I listen to that.

822
00:53:09,122 --> 00:53:10,808
Rym: I'm friends with that podcaster.

823
00:53:10,828 --> 00:53:12,754
Scott: Yeah, it's like hey, I've heard of them.

824
00:53:12,794 --> 00:53:14,098
Scott: They're just normal.

825
00:53:14,138 --> 00:53:14,479
Scott: What do you?

826
00:53:15,883 --> 00:53:17,740
Scott: Great, but not the worst podcast.

827
00:53:18,801 --> 00:53:20,367
Rym: Yep, so and it will take us.

828
00:53:20,427 --> 00:53:30,119
Rym: probably I think the week after next we're actually gonna announce the winners cuz I want to spend The time to thoroughly listen to each and every one of these perhaps to get relevant audio to put into our show.

829
00:53:30,722 --> 00:53:34,857
Scott: Do you really want to make a her podcast so terrible by putting the worst podcast ever in it?

830
00:53:35,198 --> 00:53:35,720
Rym: possibly?

831
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:37,263
Rym: Possibly.

832
00:53:37,324 --> 00:53:46,096
Scott: Well, if anything it'll help people understand how great our podcast is Placed in such stark and abrupt contrast with a the worst podcast there ever was.

833
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:49,333
Rym: Oh By the way, you should listen to anime world order.
